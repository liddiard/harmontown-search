0	25000	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
25000	51000	My name is Red Carpet John.
51000	54000	Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
54000	56000	Did he come to mow the lawn?
56000	66000	Yeah. Hey, I got my tuxedo on. I'm interviewing the stars.
66000	68000	Red Carpet John is a...
68000	70000	Is he in any relation to MC John who mows the lawn?
70000	75000	Of course. It's probably the same guy.
75000	79000	Is he related? It's the same guy in a jacket.
79000	81000	Now, explain this to me, Dan.
81000	83000	You go through the effort of putting on a tuxedo,
83000	87000	and you don't bother to button your clip on bow tie.
87000	90000	It's more about physics.
90000	93000	It's more about what can be done.
93000	95000	I believe I bought this tux.
95000	99000	The first Oscars I actually... or Emmy's or something I got to go to.
99000	103000	I think I fluctuate weights a little bit, so...
103000	106000	You don't know when a shirt's gonna be able to button or not.
106000	108000	It was the shirt. You couldn't get the shirt closed.
108000	112000	Yeah, it's actually the shirt. The bow tie doesn't go around anything.
112000	115000	It's just, as you know...
115000	118000	Family!
118000	120000	Did you watch any of the Oscars, Herman?
120000	123000	Yeah, we watched a little bit. I like the opening.
123000	127000	The opening... It's NPH, so he's coming out.
127000	129000	We know what they're going after.
129000	133000	They're going after the Hugh Jackman Oscars that I wrote.
133000	137000	They're pursuing that.
137000	141000	We know. I won an Emmy for writing those Oscars.
141000	145000	Look it up.
145000	149000	NPH, if you can't get Hugh, go to him.
149000	151000	Did you see the opening?
151000	152000	I did not.
152000	154000	It was pretty cool.
154000	157000	They actually did... I don't know.
157000	159000	Did he do a song and dance?
159000	161000	Yeah, he just did a straight-up song.
161000	165000	He had humorous elements, but it was...
165000	173000	It was both sincere and totally respectful of the modern world.
173000	181000	It did a good job of making it feel like you were watching something worth watching live.
181000	185000	As we increasingly start to ask the question, why are we watching this shit?
185000	188000	I thought it was an opener that really answered that question.
188000	190000	Check it out. This is nice.
190000	193000	Doogie's doing his thing.
193000	198000	They did special effects that blended the live action with the thing.
198000	202000	A huge kind of fuck you to Billy Crystal.
202000	210000	They just did a little quick thrown-over-the-shoulder visual montage of him sitting in little things.
210000	213000	It wasn't a fuck you. I'm just saying.
213000	215000	Less is more.
215000	218000	It was really nice, interplay with animation on the screen and stuff.
218000	220000	At the end of it, everyone liked it.
220000	226000	I said, there's no standing ovation.
226000	228000	Did Hugh get a standing O?
228000	231000	Yes.
231000	235000	And by Hugh, I mean you.
235000	239000	I thought you said you and I had no problem with it.
239000	243000	Your ears filtered out the hood part of that?
243000	247000	I looked at my phone later.
247000	251000	I didn't hear my phone beep when it beeped.
251000	253000	I saw what time the time stamp was.
253000	255000	It was as that thing ended.
255000	262000	It was a text from Rob Schwab that said, no standing O.
262000	264000	Nice.
264000	267000	It's nice to know we're still keeping it real.
267000	269000	81st Oscars.
269000	271000	Let's see what I got in here.
272000	275000	What's the deal with Oscar night?
275000	278000	I mean, what is it? Some kind of gala?
278000	280000	No.
280000	284000	It just says, no standing O in my notes. That's it.
284000	286000	I don't know what I thought was going to be in there.
286000	288000	The Gettysburg Address.
288000	290000	It seems like we hold some truths to be self-evident.
290000	292000	Not the Gettysburg Address.
292000	295000	When you were at your Oscars, how many Oscars was that ago?
295000	298000	Those were the 81st. That's going to be six years ago now.
298000	300000	Did you watch it from the wings or were you out in the crowd?
300000	303000	We were watching it. I think I've told this story a lot.
303000	310000	We were watching from a tiny old-school CRT television backstage,
310000	315000	and it was awesome because we were in these shitty rented tuxes
315000	317000	because we didn't have time to go home,
317000	320000	and they have this tux kind of service.
320000	322000	There's so much crew that works on that show,
322000	324000	so everyone's working really hard.
324000	328000	You get a number and you go up to this wardrobe floor
328000	332000	and they just give you a tux for the night if you're a crew.
332000	336000	So we had these laminates on and we had these shitty baggy tuxes on
336000	338000	and we were just watching from this walk-in closet
338000	342000	on this little television screen, watching Hugh Jackman go through the thing.
342000	346000	I swear I broke a bone in my foot from jumping up and down
346000	348000	because he was nailing it.
348000	351000	It's not a good story. It's just a really fun time in my life.
351000	355000	Every once in a while, Ben Schwartz, now it seems funny
355000	357000	that he was one of the three musketeers
357000	361000	because now he's a famous actor on Parks and Rec,
361000	367000	and of course House of Lies with Don Cheadle.
367000	369000	Is that the name of that show?
369000	373000	Every once in a while, he'll email a photo of Bruce Valanche
373000	376000	sleeping in a corner or something.
376000	378000	Then we took from back then.
378000	380000	We were just kids. We didn't know what we were doing,
380000	383000	and Hollywood loved us for it.
383000	385000	Jeff, I could go on with my Hollywood stories.
385000	387000	Stop me if I have it. I probably have.
387000	389000	I told you my story about the one time I went, right?
389000	391000	When I met that crazy lady?
391000	394000	Yeah, a crazy lady picked you up at a bar like Midnight Cowboy.
394000	397000	No, at the hair salon.
397000	400000	And then she proceeded... I have told those stories.
400000	402000	She was a crazy lady and you had to bail out of the cab.
402000	404000	Yeah, it was bad.
404000	407000	It was very clear at like hour three that she had had pills
407000	412000	and then the booze was combining and she hawked out.
413000	416000	Do you remember why she was there?
416000	420000	She had previously been nominated for art department
420000	422000	or something like that.
422000	423000	Or like art set design or something like that.
423000	425000	That must be a weird haunted life to lead.
425000	427000	Do you really just get to go if you win anything?
427000	429000	Like if you drew Shrek's balls,
429000	432000	do you get to just keep going to the Oscars every year?
432000	435000	I think if you've been nominated, you're allowed to go,
435000	437000	but we were sitting way up top.
437000	438000	You're not down on the main floor.
438000	439000	Because even just watching it,
439000	441000	even just having touched it a little bit,
441000	444000	I don't know if it's jealousy or just like what it is,
444000	448000	but it's definitely like there's a haunted feeling.
448000	450000	I want to be back there at the Kodak.
450000	453000	The smell of grease paint.
453000	455000	Here's what I want to know.
455000	457000	Okay, so a couple years ago,
457000	461000	so some of you kids are young enough that you were around,
461000	463000	like you probably don't remember,
463000	466000	that they would do the In Memoriam at the Oscars
466000	471000	and there was a time before they told everybody,
471000	473000	don't clap for each one.
473000	477000	Especially don't clap for your favorites.
477000	479000	Because they're all dead.
479000	481000	See, so it's starting to get weird.
481000	484000	But it was like forever, that was just the tradition.
484000	486000	They would just show people, you know,
486000	488000	and then Ernest Borgnine would come up
488000	490000	and there would be like an applause break
490000	492000	and then they'd fly through three like,
492000	495000	Timothy the Bone Man key grip or whatever.
495000	498000	Fuck you.
498000	500000	Did you key grip for Ernest Borgnine?
500000	502000	Because I don't give a fuck.
502000	505000	And then like these rousing applause.
505000	507000	So they did away with that.
507000	510000	Probably a good move, great cultural advancement that we made.
510000	512000	I don't know about the end the Oscar goes to
512000	514000	as opposed to end the winner as that seems a little empty
514000	516000	as far as like correctness.
516000	520000	But I do think that we evolved when someone said,
520000	525000	let's tell him don't applaud until after all the death.
525000	528000	However, now it's even weirder.
528000	531000	Just like these faces come up.
531000	534000	You kind of like brace yourself for Robin Williams
534000	537000	because he's the headliner death.
537000	539000	And you're like, are they going to save him for last?
539000	540000	How does this work?
540000	542000	We're always asking these morbid questions, aren't we,
542000	543000	during these things?
543000	546000	Because you're blending two worlds that don't belong.
546000	548000	Presentation, entertainment,
548000	552000	the inevitability of the corporeal world.
552000	554000	Where do you put Robin in that?
554000	556000	I imagine they went alphabetically
556000	558000	or I don't know what they did.
558000	559000	I actually don't.
559000	561000	I know they did.
561000	562000	Chronologically.
562000	566000	In order of death.
566000	568000	How did you know that?
568000	571000	Mike Nichols was last?
571000	572000	Okay.
572000	573000	All right.
573000	574000	Two points to terminal line.
574000	575000	Okay.
575000	577000	So you're watching.
577000	578000	Mike Nichols, Lauren Bacolic.
578000	580000	I don't know if we say this every year,
580000	582000	but it was a tragic year.
582000	588000	Tragic in terms of the amount of fame that died.
588000	593000	It's hard to honor the famous dead without feeling weird
593000	597000	because you're like, what am I rooting for?
597000	598000	I didn't know them.
598000	603000	But people were like, everyone was silent.
603000	606000	There was no like, okay, well, Robin Williams, okay, great.
606000	611000	But for three or four people, there's always this weird sound.
611000	613000	You hear the sound.
613000	614000	Come on up in a second.
614000	617000	Let me finish my point.
617000	620000	You hear this, it'll say Mike Nichols,
620000	623000	and then you'll just hear two or three people
623000	627000	somewhere in the back of the house.
627000	630000	So we know that that's not like Mrs. Nichols
630000	634000	because no one's going to express their connection
634000	637000	to the death with applause.
637000	640000	And we also know it's therefore a human being
640000	643000	that knows that they're breaking rank.
643000	647000	So it was just like the world's biggest psycho Mike Nichols fan.
647000	648000	Yeah.
648000	650000	Like, fuck these other dead people.
650000	652000	You go, Mikey.
652000	653000	Like, who are these?
653000	654000	It's so weird.
654000	657000	I would say as somebody who's A, a huge Mike Nichols fan,
657000	660000	B, somebody who doesn't like the no applause rule.
660000	663000	No, I'm allowed to applaud Mike Nichols
663000	665000	because he wrote The Graduate or whatever.
665000	666000	Right.
666000	667000	It's like some kind of weird career project.
667000	669000	There's writers in the audience like applauding
669000	671000	or something for Billy Wilder.
671000	672000	I don't know.
672000	673000	I don't know.
673000	674000	I don't know.
674000	675000	I don't know.
675000	678000	I don't know.
678000	681000	Are you a little on the way that you're not invited back this year?
681000	682000	That you're not?
682000	683000	No.
684000	686000	Look, when I was at the Oscars,
686000	688000	I was a lowly Keebler elf backstage.
688000	690000	I was honored to do my duty.
690000	693000	I wrote a little bit of Patter for Jack Black and Jennifer Aniston,
693000	696000	and I wrote that Emmy-winning opening.
696000	698000	And thank you.
698000	699000	Thanks.
699000	700000	If you want to look it up,
700000	705000	I won an Emmy for writing the Oscars, which is kind of cool.
705000	707000	Can you sing a little bit of it for us?
707000	709000	Do you remember your favorite line from it?
709000	712000	Everything is awesome.
712000	713000	Everything.
713000	715000	I can't remember.
715000	718000	The Lonely Island guys were on stage tonight at the Oscars.
718000	720000	Jack Black was in the opening.
720000	723000	He Kanye-ed the NPH opening.
723000	724000	It was kind of fun.
724000	727000	He did like a sort of pseudo Jack Black rap.
727000	728000	It was fun.
728000	731000	I find myself wondering if they wrote that for Kanye
731000	733000	and then got Jack to do it.
733000	734000	And Jack said, I can't rap.
734000	736000	And they're like, well, kind of sing rap.
736000	739000	If you watch it, I feel like we're kind of hoping
739000	742000	that Kanye could come and just watch it.
742000	745000	And we were in line in the rain, Dan.
745000	748000	We weren't late.
748000	754000	Speaking of immemorial, it feels like weird to not mention
754000	760000	that our friend, a friend of so many of us, Harris Whittles,
760000	763000	is lost now.
763000	768000	It couldn't have been a more tragic passing.
768000	774000	Very much just tragic, just accidental.
774000	780000	I would like to take one moment to say to people who every time
780000	784000	when somebody's death involves a car,
784000	791000	you don't divert your attention away from who the person was
791000	794000	and whether you respect them or not or whether you'll miss them
794000	797000	to spend a lot of time about automobile statistics
797000	799000	and the industry and insurance and stuff.
799000	800000	And here's a number you can call.
800000	803000	Make sure you're insured.
803000	806000	Leave it the fuck alone.
806000	809000	Everybody takes cars everywhere every day.
809000	811000	Cars kill all kinds of people.
811000	814000	Writers do heroin, cocaine.
814000	815000	They drink.
815000	818000	People have different addictions and struggles.
818000	821000	They are, in addition to that, human beings.
821000	826000	If you don't know the person and they died in a way
826000	829000	that is symbolic for you politically,
829000	834000	think for a second before you leave that Instagram caption
834000	836000	or that tweet.
836000	840000	It's not your time to work some shit out.
840000	843000	It's just a guy that died.
843000	848000	And it's no more cool on God's part to kill somebody
848000	853000	through a horrible, pressing addiction
853000	858000	than it is to kill them with an anvil or cancer or anything.
858000	862000	It is all part of this big shitty world that we're all united in.
862000	867000	And Harris was, if you go online
867000	874000	and you're going to see how incredibly tragic it is
874000	877000	that he would be taken from us at such a young age
877000	882000	and he was not irresponsible and he did not make bad choices
882000	885000	and he was very smart and very self-aware
885000	891000	and just very, very, very, very funny and just a good guy
891000	894000	and he just had a bad accident and now he's gone
894000	896000	and this is the way life is.
897000	902000	I retweeted an article that was a really nice,
902000	906000	trying to find the words of who was he,
906000	910000	why was he so cool and why did we not notice,
910000	914000	what labels to put it on, how to describe him.
914000	917000	That's one of the nice things about this new podcast universe
917000	920000	is you can just type in his name and you can go find him
920000	924000	on so many podcasts telling really amazing stories
924000	927000	about struggling with his addiction, for instance,
927000	929000	about all kinds of things.
929000	932000	He was a lynchpin of this community
932000	937000	and so many of us are just really, really shaken by this one.
937000	941000	It's a tough one and you want that bargaining phase to be,
941000	944000	okay, so let's all make up our minds, call your sponsor,
944000	947000	put this bumper sticker on your thing and wear this ribbon.
947000	952000	That's just bargaining and it's as healthy as denial
953000	957000	but ultimately acceptance is the only thing that's going to be honest.
957000	960000	Who gives a fuck how they died?
960000	964000	It's not important, it's not who they were
964000	968000	and there's no such thing as a deserved death or anything like that
968000	971000	so please just notice how cool the guy was,
971000	974000	go listen to his stories.
974000	977000	He was an old soul, I guess.
977000	979000	I had no idea he was that young, really.
979000	982000	That's a horrible way to find out that somebody was 30 years old.
982000	984000	I didn't know either.
984000	987000	He was just a kid when he started working on the Sarah Silverman show
987000	989000	after I left.
989000	994000	He kind of arrived there as I left to sort of fill that vacuum
994000	997000	and he was literally a child
997000	1001000	and was just like you can't swing a cat in this city
1001000	1005000	without finding somebody that has a good story about him
1006000	1009000	and now it's all laced with this stuff
1009000	1013000	and there's nothing to do but grieve and accept it.
1013000	1015000	Sports corner!
1015000	1017000	No, I'm kidding, there's no sport at this time.
1024000	1026000	Yeah, okay.
1029000	1032000	Let's bring out Dino Stamatopoulos who I haven't seen since he...
1035000	1053000	I just wanted to say that I actually met Harris here once
1053000	1055000	and we kind of shared a moment
1055000	1059000	and I can't believe he's gone humblebrag.
1059000	1066000	There's a lot of humblebragging going on in the wake of his passing.
1066000	1068000	You see this?
1068000	1071000	I fucking peed in my pants.
1071000	1073000	What do you mean? Tell us about it.
1073000	1075000	Well, I got here and I had to pee really bad
1075000	1079000	and the guy out there, he was really nice.
1079000	1081000	He's like Dan's already out there.
1081000	1083000	Oh, he's out there?
1083000	1087000	I don't know for some reason I felt like you ran a tight ship.
1088000	1091000	What's he talking about himself?
1091000	1093000	He'll need me any second.
1093000	1098000	So yeah, I went and I took a piss and I zipped up too soon.
1098000	1100000	I was still peeing.
1100000	1102000	That's a fucking nightmare.
1102000	1104000	So not really peeing your pants.
1104000	1107000	No, I actually peed in my pants.
1107000	1109000	You peed on them?
1109000	1111000	Oh, you're saying you just have more pee to do
1111000	1113000	and then you zipped up your pants and you just kept peeing.
1113000	1114000	Just zipped them up and I kept going.
1114000	1115000	Oh, okay.
1115000	1116000	It was stupid.
1116000	1118000	They say that no matter how you shake or dance,
1118000	1121000	the last drop is always in your pants.
1121000	1124000	That sounds like something MC John would say.
1124000	1128000	Well, keys to the parrots and the parrots to the keys.
1128000	1133000	So I was just at a little Dom's and they put my drink to go.
1133000	1134000	Oh, that's nice.
1134000	1135000	Welcome back. I haven't seen you.
1135000	1136000	Thank you.
1136000	1137000	This is the only way we can get together.
1137000	1138000	I know. I know.
1138000	1140000	You're working a lot and I'm just drunk.
1140000	1141000	Yeah.
1141000	1142000	You're traveling.
1142000	1144000	You've been back for a couple of weeks now
1144000	1145000	and I haven't seen you at all.
1145000	1148000	Yeah. You like, you go off, you're traveling the world,
1148000	1152000	Canada and Canada and Canada.
1152000	1154000	I was in New York working for Smigel.
1154000	1155000	Yeah. Yeah.
1155000	1157000	On the insult comic dog show.
1157000	1158000	Insult comic dog show.
1158000	1159000	Is that what it's called?
1159000	1162000	Yeah.
1162000	1166000	It needs work, but I think it'll be okay.
1166000	1170000	So what's, compare him to me vertically.
1170000	1171000	Hierarchically.
1171000	1181000	I could sneak out easier out of his show than your show.
1181000	1185000	So he's more talented.
1185000	1188000	He doesn't notice you're gone.
1188000	1189000	Are you sad to be back?
1189000	1191000	Cause you were living the high life out there, man.
1191000	1193000	Yeah. I mean, it was ridiculous.
1193000	1195000	I visited Dino out there and tell me if I'm wrong,
1195000	1197000	you would work a little bit at the office.
1197000	1199000	Then you would take your work away to.
1199000	1201000	I barely at the office. I was like, you know,
1201000	1205000	I can't really work here. I like working at a bar.
1205000	1207000	And they're like, yeah, whatever works for you.
1207000	1210000	And, you know, I would just get drunk and write.
1210000	1212000	And then you would go eat French food.
1212000	1217000	Yeah. And go eat French food and fuck boys and girls.
1217000	1219000	Cause you were fucking everybody out there.
1219000	1225000	Yeah. It turns out that everyone in fucking New York is beautiful,
1225000	1227000	including me, apparently.
1228000	1230000	Who would have known? It was ridiculous.
1230000	1232000	So just being in the city made you extra sexy?
1232000	1234000	Yeah. I don't know how.
1234000	1237000	I think people go out there because they want to have an adventure.
1237000	1239000	They want to like, I want to fuck things up.
1239000	1244000	I want to be, I want to, you know, deal with ugliness and shit.
1244000	1247000	And then there I am.
1247000	1250000	With trousers soaked in your own urine?
1250000	1253000	Yeah. Urine. I mean, this is not going to go away tonight.
1253000	1255000	There's that much? I can't, I can't see it.
1255000	1258000	Take a look at this. You can see it from there.
1258000	1261000	You're wearing kind of pea colored pants almost.
1261000	1265000	No, these were white before I got here.
1265000	1267000	Wow. That's a lot of pee.
1267000	1272000	You got to subscribe to the live feed for stuff like that.
1272000	1273000	You really do.
1273000	1276000	I'm going to take the cap off because this scotch is too hot.
1276000	1278000	If you did not subscribe to the live feed,
1278000	1282000	you're really missing out on a pee stain right now.
1282000	1284000	How have you guys been doing?
1285000	1289000	I've been doing good. It's really hard to write community this year.
1289000	1292000	It's like, you're doing it, you're doing it for the fans.
1292000	1294000	You don't really want to write it.
1294000	1297000	Seriously. Admit it.
1297000	1299000	Admit it.
1299000	1300000	No.
1300000	1302000	You really don't want to write it.
1302000	1305000	You want to do it for the people. That's admirable.
1305000	1311000	I will admit that I don't, I don't, I'm not 100% sure I did it for my own joy.
1312000	1316000	But the last thing I'm going to do is lay it on the fucking fan's doorstep.
1316000	1318000	They're watching season six and they're like,
1318000	1320000	this sucks and then there's a footnote.
1320000	1322000	Dan says it's your fault.
1322000	1324000	That's not what I was saying.
1324000	1327000	I'm saying that you want to do it.
1327000	1329000	You want to do it for your fans.
1329000	1332000	I think I was like, through God knows what, I do feel,
1332000	1335000	and the other thing is you're listening to my running commentary
1335000	1337000	while I'm in the process here.
1337000	1341000	So don't, I mean, just feel this in the moment with me
1341000	1344000	because I never know what the fuck I'm talking about.
1344000	1348000	But right now I feel like I am doing a horrible job.
1348000	1351000	A couple weeks ago I was like, I'm a god, I did it.
1351000	1354000	And then a couple weeks before that, and I swear it goes,
1354000	1357000	because it just depends on I'll see a cut and I'll be like, oh, it's working, okay.
1357000	1359000	That's how God works.
1359000	1362000	That's why they're tsunamis is like, I fucked up.
1362000	1363000	Yeah.
1364000	1367000	Wait, he fucks up and then does the tsunami to like, oh, I don't know.
1367000	1369000	What the fuck I'm talking about.
1369000	1372000	I was just happy I turned and you were laughing.
1372000	1374000	That guy goes like, oh, fuck it. God damn it.
1374000	1377000	I made too many people again.
1377000	1379000	Tsunami time.
1379000	1381000	I definitely just feel, I feel the burn.
1381000	1383000	It feels like, it feels like doing a crunch.
1383000	1388000	Like I just feel like for better or for worse, like I'm like, I'm working.
1388000	1390000	I feel like we need to do a television.
1391000	1396000	I feel like we need to do a telethon for the fans and say, lay off him.
1396000	1399000	Let him, let him not work on community for a while.
1399000	1402000	I think this is a problem that solves itself at all.
1402000	1405000	You know, if it's a bad season, then it'll kind of go away.
1405000	1411000	But the, I just, I think that it's just, I think if you did anything for six years,
1411000	1413000	the sixth year would be like, Jesus Christ.
1413000	1415000	Like, like, am I in the zone?
1415000	1420000	I mean, I was like, like, like three, three of the first seven characters are gone.
1420000	1424000	So now, and what am I doing with the remaining four and what am I doing with the new two?
1424000	1426000	Am I, am I servicing them?
1426000	1428000	Am I exploring them?
1428000	1433000	Can it ever really, I try to, I try to like psych myself out and sell myself.
1433000	1434000	It's just a new show.
1434000	1437000	So just, I just dimensionalize the characters.
1437000	1440000	Or is that my job or am I supposed to just be telling jokes?
1440000	1443000	And I, I don't, I don't know what I'm doing.
1443000	1448000	And then I, and then I'll watch a cut and I'll be like, and Tuesday I'll be like, I did it.
1448000	1450000	It's the best season ever.
1450000	1452000	Can't believe it's on the internet instead of TV.
1452000	1453000	Yeah, that's the way you do it.
1453000	1455000	And then on Wednesday, I'm like, I fucked up.
1455000	1456000	Yeah.
1456000	1457000	I did it real bad.
1457000	1458000	Yeah.
1458000	1460000	I want to go home.
1460000	1462000	My wife hasn't seen me.
1462000	1464000	Like, now I just sleep on my couch in the office.
1464000	1468000	Like, like, like last week, she saw me on Valentine's Day, which was Saturday.
1468000	1471000	And then she saw me the following Saturday.
1471000	1474000	I was slept at my office every day.
1474000	1477000	And you're going to stay together forever.
1477000	1479000	That's the way to do a relationship.
1479000	1480000	I don't know.
1480000	1485000	I got some pretty shitty texts.
1485000	1490000	We should, we should, we should, we should read our text messages with, with, to, to jazz music.
1490000	1494000	No, I, I don't, I don't know what that would be.
1494000	1496000	I don't know what that would, how that would work.
1496000	1500000	Do you know, on another note, can you tell the story about that couple that you were,
1500000	1501000	tell me about that?
1501000	1502000	Oh, yeah.
1502000	1509000	Well, there, well, for some reason, you know, I go out to New York and I'm attractive.
1509000	1511000	I already said that.
1511000	1513000	And it's baffling to me.
1513000	1521000	And there's a 23 year old couple and they want to have a threesome with, you know, I guess they want to fuck their grandfather.
1521000	1522000	Say yours truly.
1522000	1523000	That's a good way to do it.
1523000	1524000	Yeah.
1524000	1525000	Yours truly.
1525000	1526000	Or their grandfather.
1526000	1527000	I fucked up.
1527000	1528000	Okay.
1528000	1529000	I stepped on your grandfather punchline.
1529000	1531000	I wouldn't have gotten a laugh anyway.
1531000	1532000	But anyway.
1532000	1535000	Smigel would have given you space.
1535000	1540000	So, I don't know if it's a, if it's a good story or not.
1540000	1548000	I just, I, so, so we were going to fuck one night.
1548000	1550000	And first off, where did you meet them?
1550000	1551000	Like Lucian?
1551000	1553000	No, at the library bar.
1553000	1554000	Okay.
1554000	1555000	Yeah.
1555000	1562000	So, how does it, how does it, how does it, for those of us who forgot, because it hasn't happened in a little bit.
1562000	1569000	How does, what does it sound like and look like when a couple chooses you?
1569000	1570000	I'll tell you what it sounds like.
1570000	1574000	It sounds like the girl is going, yeah, we're really open to everything.
1574000	1576000	We're, we're, we want to, we want to experiment.
1576000	1580000	We want to have sex with the grossest shit in the world and all that.
1580000	1582000	And the guy's like, you know, whatever she wants.
1582000	1588000	It's like, well, I don't know.
1588000	1591000	I mean, you know, whatever.
1591000	1592000	How you doing?
1592000	1593000	Can I buy you a drink?
1593000	1598000	And then, so, yeah.
1598000	1602000	The guy, the guy obviously wasn't as into it as, as a girl.
1602000	1609000	I'd rather hear that story, though, than the, where the, where the woman is like, okay, am I doing all right for you, Bob?
1609000	1610000	Yeah.
1610000	1615000	So, so in the middle of that, I was like, well, you guys figure it out.
1615000	1618000	I'm going to meet my friends and I'm going to go have dinner.
1618000	1620000	And they went out and they got coke.
1620000	1628000	And of course, you know, I'm start getting texts like my, you know, for you kids out there.
1628000	1630000	My phone was ringing off the hook.
1630000	1631000	I don't know if you know what that means.
1631000	1633000	It's an expression.
1633000	1635000	Yeah.
1635000	1636000	Like, yeah, we're ready.
1636000	1637000	We're ready.
1637000	1638000	Where are you?
1638000	1642000	Like eating fucking peeking duck and getting really fat and farty.
1642000	1652000	And, and finally I just said, look, I can't fart through your, our threesome, you know, let's do it tomorrow after I take a shit.
1652000	1653000	Right.
1653000	1657000	When you guys are really turned on.
1657000	1658000	Yeah.
1658000	1662000	So, you know, news flash, the guy doesn't want to fuck me anymore.
1662000	1666000	And, and the girl breaks up with the guy.
1666000	1667000	Yeah.
1667000	1673000	And now she wants to have a twosome.
1673000	1675000	Now she wants to have a twosome for the rest of her life.
1675000	1676000	Okay.
1676000	1682000	And I, you know, I told her, I was like, you know, I mean, like, come on, I have a kid.
1682000	1687000	I have a, I have 8,000 fucking animals and frogs.
1687000	1689000	I fuck, you know, I mean, I don't know.
1689000	1695000	I just meaning you're, you're, you're, you're an untamed stallion is what.
1695000	1696000	Yeah.
1696000	1706000	I didn't want to put it that way because I'm humble, but so, but, you know, well, then we had some good sex and, you know, I have her pictures of my phone.
1706000	1709000	You want to see him?
1709000	1710000	I do.
1710000	1711000	Can we put him on the feed or?
1711000	1713000	Yeah, I don't care.
1713000	1716000	Our show just becomes 4chan.
1716000	1719000	Put her address up there.
1719000	1723000	You might have, you might have to like scroll through a few of my dicks.
1723000	1727000	I have.
1727000	1731000	Dino has seven dicks.
1731000	1735000	I got, I got a few more since New York.
1735000	1737000	Fucking counts full of them.
1737000	1746000	I remember one time you were talking, you're telling some story about how you had to delete a couple of things on your phone to take a picture because there was so much porn on it or something.
1746000	1749000	I, in my mind, you said porn, but you must have said something else.
1749000	1753000	It was like ambiguous, like, like, like, like, like sex movies or something.
1753000	1756000	Because I remember I just heard, I just thought I was like, really?
1756000	1757000	You on your phone?
1757000	1759000	Like, that's, that's interesting.
1759000	1764000	It's like just for using in the bathroom or like, no, no, I mean, you know, well, okay, go ahead.
1764000	1768000	You remember the, and you're like, well, yeah, I don't know.
1768000	1769000	Whatever, whatever.
1769000	1772000	And I was like, well, can I see?
1772000	1773000	And you're like, yeah.
1773000	1777000	And you started playing when I'm like, that's the person that I know.
1777000	1781000	I thought you meant from the internets.
1781000	1784000	I thought you meant Debbie does Dallas.
1784000	1793000	I know. I was like, well, that's Natalie from marketing.
1793000	1796000	You just thought that I was like, okay, can I see?
1796000	1802000	Yeah. Well, I thought Mr. Harmon from community.
1802000	1805000	But you're breaking so many hearts out there.
1805000	1807000	These girls are just falling for you.
1807000	1809000	It's not just that you're out there being promiscuous.
1809000	1812000	They're resilient. They're resilient. Girls don't care.
1812000	1813000	I mean, look at me.
1813000	1816000	No one's going to break their heart over me, right, girls?
1816000	1822000	But I lost my phone hiking like a year ago.
1822000	1826000	And that phone, God damn it, has so much shit about me.
1826000	1834000	Like, like texts, like ridiculous texts and pictures of everyone and me.
1834000	1839000	And like, you know, like I like to take pictures of my dick and my face.
1839000	1844000	Because, you know, you don't send a dick pic with just a dick.
1844000	1845000	You get that anywhere tonight.
1845000	1847000	Can I get it tonight?
1847000	1851000	Can I get a picture of my dick in your face?
1851000	1857000	I always put on mine, I put like a newspaper headline that says Dewey defeats Truman.
1857000	1866000	Just because I want to remind the woman like, don't believe everything you see.
1866000	1868000	This was an early edition.
1868000	1872000	Yeah, actually, when you take a picture like that with your dick and then your face,
1872000	1875000	your dick looks huge. Like it's enveloping your face.
1875000	1876000	I've never understood it.
1876000	1884000	I mean, I guess this is probably a small penis thing.
1884000	1886000	I just don't understand.
1886000	1888000	Take it like this?
1888000	1891000	No, but it's not my goal to make it look big.
1891000	1896000	That would be like if Ewan McGregor was my headshot and I was an actor.
1896000	1903000	They want me to come in again? Okay.
1903000	1906000	I don't understand the dick pic thing.
1906000	1910000	On paper, when you hear about that, you immediately think to yourself,
1910000	1915000	this is something that only men would think that women would want.
1915000	1917000	Women ask for it. I swear to God.
1917000	1922000	And it's like, clearly, like over time, what I've learned is that just by its longevity
1922000	1927000	as a cultural thing is that there is participation in this on both sides.
1927000	1930000	Girls will solicit a dick pic from you.
1930000	1936000	Maybe there's a length of feminism you can go to to the point where you're actually like...
1936000	1940000	I don't know if you felt that wave of tittering going through the crowd right now.
1940000	1942000	I was thinking...
1942000	1946000	Every girl just remembers the last time they solicited a dick pic from somebody.
1946000	1950000	I mean, this is why I wish we had that polling technology.
1950000	1953000	I want to know, because I don't want anyone to have to say out loud.
1953000	1954000	Have them say out loud.
1954000	1957000	Well, the people that say out loud, then what's their deal?
1958000	1960000	They want to see your dick.
1960000	1966000	But it would be interesting to get an honest poll of how many women in the audience,
1966000	1970000	have they ever said to a man in one form or another in text,
1970000	1973000	send me a picture of your dick or something like that.
1973000	1975000	Anybody out there, girls?
1975000	1978000	One woman says, oh yeah, for sure.
1978000	1980000	We heard one for sure.
1980000	1981000	What's your name?
1981000	1982000	My name's Lana.
1982000	1983000	Lana, get up here.
1984000	1987000	If you want to.
1989000	1995000	When you ask for a dick pic, you face the crowd.
1996000	1997000	Meet the press.
1997000	1999000	Chop, chop, chop.
2001000	2002000	Well, thank you.
2002000	2003000	I'm nervous too.
2004000	2006000	There's a mic next to you, Lana.
2006000	2008000	There's another one over here.
2008000	2009000	Lana, was it?
2009000	2010000	Wow.
2010000	2011000	Hello, Lana.
2011000	2014000	I'm curious about the context of when you solicit a,
2014000	2017000	is it like, it's just a guy you like and it's like,
2017000	2021000	I mean, I guess the analog is if...
2021000	2023000	Yeah, I mean, it's not like random.
2023000	2026000	It's not like, oh hey, dude, on the street, you just gave me your number.
2026000	2027000	It's not bad.
2027000	2029000	It's like an extension of phone sex.
2029000	2032000	Like when there was only landlines.
2033000	2035000	Sometimes a relationship would get to the point,
2035000	2037000	like very infrequently with me.
2037000	2042000	But it's like, oh, I'm not with you and we can't be together.
2042000	2045000	And then you do weird things through the medium that's allowed.
2045000	2046000	And so now we have pictures.
2046000	2048000	You'd have to be in your phone already, right?
2048000	2049000	Yes, yes, yes, of course.
2049000	2050000	What's your number?
2053000	2055000	I got to get it out, baby.
2055000	2059000	And so I'm assuming that the way the conversation probably goes
2059000	2064000	is the guy probably says, in terms of flattering the woman,
2064000	2067000	like, I am in this state right now.
2067000	2071000	And then the woman says, you know, picture it didn't happen.
2071000	2073000	Let's see it.
2073000	2076000	When you're asking for that, did you...
2076000	2080000	Okay, for this particular guy, you had already seen the wiener in question.
2080000	2082000	You weren't seeing it for the first time.
2082000	2083000	That would be weird.
2083000	2084000	That would definitely be weird.
2084000	2085000	That would be a weird way to see it for the first time.
2085000	2087000	Yes, it's not like you're going shopping.
2087000	2088000	No, no, no, no.
2088000	2090000	But if you've already seen...
2090000	2091000	This is the thing about a wiener.
2091000	2097000	If you've already seen it, I guess I just need to relax a little bit
2097000	2100000	and go, you know what, maybe women like sex too, I guess.
2100000	2102000	Kind of the way that men do.
2102000	2104000	It's kind of a way of having sex without having sex.
2104000	2107000	It's like having sex for a distance, right?
2107000	2108000	Pretty much.
2108000	2110000	Admittedly, I've been lucky.
2110000	2114000	So generally the pics I get sent are fairly impressive.
2114000	2116000	So there's the hat.
2116000	2118000	The Eiffel Towers in the background.
2118000	2121000	There's a...
2121000	2123000	He's got his pinky out.
2123000	2125000	No.
2125000	2126000	There's a hoverboard.
2126000	2127000	I don't know what's...
2127000	2128000	It's a dick.
2128000	2129000	It's a dick.
2129000	2133000	But Lana, you're saying that you've already seen the wieners in question,
2133000	2135000	so you knew what you were getting more or less.
2135000	2138000	It wasn't going to be a picture of a guy's dick shaped like an ampersand
2138000	2140000	or something.
2140000	2142000	I mean, that would be impressive, but for different reasons.
2142000	2143000	Yeah, that's true.
2143000	2146000	Spencer's is shaped like the Dungeons and Dragons ampersand.
2147000	2152000	It's a dragon dick that's breathing fire that forms its own...
2153000	2156000	Spencer's dick is a nanny right now after you said that.
2156000	2158000	Are you kidding?
2158000	2160000	Spencer's dick has 20 sides.
2162000	2164000	Also impressive.
2164000	2166000	Impressive for different reasons.
2166000	2167000	Yeah.
2167000	2169000	But every hit is critical.
2169000	2171000	I don't know.
2171000	2173000	That's what I'm saying.
2173000	2175000	Don't applaud.
2175000	2177000	I...
2177000	2178000	That was the best...
2178000	2180000	I condensed that joke on the way out the door and you applauded it,
2180000	2183000	so what does that make you?
2183000	2185000	It's a very generous audience.
2185000	2187000	So Lana, are you currently seeing somebody right now?
2187000	2188000	No, actually.
2188000	2191000	You're out shopping for more dick pics, right?
2191000	2193000	Jeff, are you seeing anyone right now?
2193000	2194000	No.
2194000	2195000	Oh, hello.
2195000	2198000	How many megapixels is your camera, Jeff?
2198000	2200000	Not nearly enough, Dan.
2201000	2204000	It's like ten, ten and a half, then.
2204000	2205000	Wow.
2205000	2206000	Yeah.
2207000	2209000	Harmontown nights.
2210000	2211000	God, I wish I had a big dick.
2211000	2212000	So bad.
2213000	2215000	I would have to show it to everybody.
2216000	2218000	Remember when I took my shirt off?
2218000	2220000	People are impressed when you're not afraid to show...
2220000	2223000	You ever notice our friends like Chris Romano and actually Harris Whittles
2223000	2225000	with one of them?
2225000	2227000	Like, for a joke, they would just whip...
2228000	2231000	If Sarah would ask, they would just...
2231000	2234000	They're just naked, they're putting their balls in the coffee, whatever.
2235000	2238000	But I look and they go, eh, my dick's smaller than that.
2238000	2239000	That's why they're doing that.
2239000	2241000	So they had a big dick flaccid?
2241000	2243000	Well, yeah, I think that's what it's like...
2243000	2245000	As I've said on this show, mine is in it.
2245000	2248000	Mine, I praise only its practicality.
2252000	2256000	When it is not in operational mode, it is a nipple.
2256000	2258000	Well, yeah, so...
2258000	2260000	So's mine, so's mine.
2260000	2262000	It doesn't matter back then.
2262000	2264000	You know, like, the future is what matters.
2266000	2268000	Way back then.
2272000	2274000	Well, I'm married now.
2274000	2277000	I'll send Aaron a picture of my dick at some point, I guess.
2277000	2279000	Why would you do that?
2279000	2280000	You know, she doesn't ask.
2280000	2282000	Because I want to have done it.
2282000	2283000	I feel like it's...
2283000	2285000	Send it now.
2285000	2287000	No, no, no, no.
2287000	2289000	Jen, go into the bathroom right now.
2289000	2291000	Take a dick pic.
2291000	2293000	We'll wait for you.
2295000	2297000	I'm not gonna...
2297000	2299000	This isn't the Morton Downey show.
2299000	2300000	Yeah, yeah.
2300000	2303000	Like a Nazi throws a chair at me.
2303000	2306000	Let's bring my wife out.
2306000	2308000	Aaron McGathey...
2312000	2313000	Oh, yeah, yeah.
2313000	2317000	Stick around because I want to hear the woman's conversation about it.
2317000	2318000	Should I leave?
2318000	2320000	No, you shouldn't leave either.
2321000	2323000	She's got a big skirt on.
2325000	2327000	Oh, Aaron.
2328000	2329000	Wow.
2332000	2337000	When you wear a gown to harm the town you go...
2340000	2342000	Oscar night.
2343000	2345000	That is a whole lot of crinoline.
2345000	2347000	Can we get you another chair?
2347000	2349000	That's a lot of dress.
2349000	2350000	It's okay.
2350000	2351000	I got it.
2351000	2355000	It's an intimacy thing or a power thing.
2355000	2356000	It's dirty.
2356000	2357000	On whose side?
2357000	2358000	Is it a power thing?
2358000	2359000	Both sides.
2359000	2360000	I don't know.
2360000	2363000	The other night when you were at work...
2363000	2366000	I don't know why I was so nervous to send this to you.
2366000	2367000	You're my husband.
2367000	2371000	But I was like, I just want to ask him to take a picture of his face.
2372000	2373000	Not as a poster.
2373000	2374000	With Dino's dick in front of it.
2374000	2375000	Yeah.
2377000	2378000	Here you go, Scoops.
2378000	2379000	Do you want a drink?
2379000	2380000	Sure.
2380000	2383000	Can you pass that down to my better half?
2383000	2385000	A.K.A. Scoops.
2386000	2388000	My little cloud baby.
2388000	2390000	Oh, interesting.
2391000	2393000	You're wearing that because you saw the red carpet.
2393000	2394000	Tell me that I wanted to say something.
2394000	2398000	This year is all about beards for the men and white dresses with...
2398000	2400000	White dresses with embellishments.
2401000	2406000	So she embellished with more white dress than anybody.
2406000	2409000	This is the skirt I wore under my wedding dress.
2409000	2410000	Uncomfortable.
2413000	2416000	Yeah, I just wanted you to send a picture of your face as a...
2416000	2419000	I don't know, maybe part of it's a power thing?
2421000	2422000	Yeah.
2422000	2425000	You having the power to make your husband show a picture of his face?
2425000	2426000	Well...
2426000	2427000	No, no, no.
2427000	2429000	I'm thinking about the dick pics.
2430000	2433000	I'm toying with whether or not to say this, so I guess I'll just say this.
2433000	2435000	I have asked for dick pics.
2435000	2436000	All right.
2440000	2442000	This is at what time today?
2445000	2447000	Dan, when were you buying milk?
2451000	2454000	Because the moment Dan steps over that Daily Milk trip...
2455000	2456000	I was like, man, this is like...
2456000	2458000	Why am I always buying milk?
2459000	2461000	That's what the milk man's for.
2462000	2463000	Oh?
2465000	2469000	Well, there have been a couple times when I've sent you sexy pictures of me,
2469000	2472000	and then I've felt embarrassed because they're not reciprocated,
2472000	2473000	but it's like back and forth.
2473000	2475000	Oh, they actually came to me.
2475000	2477000	Oh! Oh, no!
2477000	2479000	Dan and Dino, oh, what a gross thought.
2479000	2481000	That's a nightmare.
2481000	2483000	That is an absolute nightmare.
2483000	2486000	You're just sitting, drawing, and then...
2486000	2487000	Oh, oh, oh, God.
2487000	2488000	I gotta go.
2488000	2489000	I'm trying.
2489000	2491000	No, you're drawing.
2491000	2493000	I think you said drawing.
2493000	2494000	I think they're drying.
2494000	2497000	You just got out of that wet, wet bath.
2497000	2500000	You're in the kitchen making your Greek chicken
2500000	2504000	and just the beads of sweat are dripping off of your disgusting body
2504000	2506000	and pee is spreading.
2506000	2507000	Oh, my God.
2507000	2509000	What are you wearing right now?
2511000	2513000	Something to cover up how much we'd have gained.
2514000	2515000	I'm just kidding.
2515000	2517000	Oh, that's nice that you feel sorry for me,
2517000	2519000	which makes me feel like I'm fatter than I am.
2519000	2520000	No, I look great.
2524000	2526000	That was like a jujitsu move.
2527000	2529000	I should send you a picture back
2529000	2531000	when you send me one of those pictures during the day.
2531000	2533000	It's just you looking cute.
2533000	2534000	I should send one back.
2534000	2535000	Well, yes, yes.
2535000	2538000	If I send you a picture of me at the library,
2538000	2541000	I would like, wow, so many copies of Bridget Jones' diary,
2541000	2543000	and then you send me back a picture of your penis.
2545000	2548000	That might not be the right space for it.
2549000	2551000	But I would still accept it.
2551000	2552000	I'd like that.
2552000	2554000	Well, that's better for me because I always don't know what to type,
2554000	2556000	so I always just go, aww.
2559000	2560000	That's great.
2560000	2563000	Sometimes you accidentally type, ah.
2564000	2565000	Ah.
2567000	2570000	And then I have to talk myself down.
2570000	2572000	Maybe more like a Fonzie, eh.
2573000	2574000	Ah.
2575000	2576000	Eh.
2578000	2579000	Lana.
2579000	2580000	Or that.
2580000	2581000	So, Lana, where are you from?
2581000	2582000	I'm from New York.
2582000	2583000	New York?
2583000	2584000	Yeah.
2584000	2585000	Living out here now or are you visiting?
2585000	2586000	Oh, no.
2586000	2587000	Oh, no.
2587000	2588000	I feel like we just had a threesome.
2588000	2589000	Weirdly.
2589000	2591000	There's one for everybody.
2591000	2593000	I've been out here for two and a half years.
2593000	2594000	Spreezing.
2594000	2595000	Yeah?
2595000	2596000	Having fun?
2596000	2597000	Yeah, so far so good.
2597000	2598000	It's been good to me.
2598000	2600000	I'm a script soup, so.
2600000	2601000	Script soup.
2601000	2602000	Yeah.
2602000	2605000	So, you know, this is Ali's little piece of beef for it,
2605000	2606000	I guess.
2606000	2607000	What's in that bottle that you're brown bagging
2607000	2608000	like a cholo from my high school?
2608000	2609000	I know.
2610000	2611000	This is what it is.
2612000	2614000	Liquid Aloha from Longford.
2614000	2615000	I don't know.
2615000	2617000	It was the only thing that wasn't like a horrible,
2617000	2618000	heavy stout.
2618000	2619000	Oh, it's beer.
2619000	2620000	Okay.
2620000	2621000	It's definitely beer.
2621000	2622000	Okay, great.
2622000	2623000	My friend is drinking straight up Kettle One, though,
2623000	2624000	so there's that.
2624000	2625000	All right.
2625000	2627000	But he's a little bit more hardcore than me.
2628000	2629000	Yeah.
2629000	2630000	Uh...
2633000	2634000	Let me finish that.
2634000	2635000	Are you fucking him?
2635000	2636000	No.
2636000	2637000	Oh, okay.
2637000	2638000	That would be...
2638000	2639000	I mean, that's weird.
2639000	2640000	Have you seen...
2640000	2641000	The guy...
2641000	2642000	Is that your significant fellow there?
2642000	2643000	No, no.
2643000	2644000	He's a friend of mine visiting from jail.
2644000	2645000	Are you dating that guy?
2645000	2646000	I am not.
2646000	2647000	I don't know.
2647000	2648000	Savvy.
2648000	2649000	What's your name with her, sir?
2649000	2650000	Brett.
2650000	2651000	Have you ever sent...
2651000	2652000	Brett?
2652000	2653000	Did you know you were insignificant?
2654000	2655000	I'm here to tell you.
2658000	2660000	Well, Erin, you brought...
2660000	2661000	Didn't you bring an activity,
2661000	2662000	an Oscar night activity?
2662000	2663000	I did.
2663000	2664000	Everybody look under your chairs.
2664000	2665000	There are three colored pens.
2665000	2666000	Oh, that's so nice.
2666000	2667000	I'm kidding.
2667000	2668000	So cute.
2668000	2669000	You're cute.
2669000	2670000	You're so cute.
2670000	2672000	That is so sweet.
2672000	2673000	That is really sweet.
2673000	2677000	That reminded me of when I was nine years old.
2677000	2678000	My dad was a preacher and he let me have...
2678000	2680000	You guys are nine years old.
2680000	2681000	He let me have...
2682000	2683000	I asked one day if I could get up and talk
2683000	2684000	for the church.
2684000	2685000	This is the first and last time he let me do this.
2685000	2688000	I came in early and I took bags of glitter
2688000	2691000	and taped them underneath all the chairs
2691000	2692000	to...
2692000	2693000	Because I wanted to tell a story.
2693000	2696000	I had just read the story or heard the story
2696000	2700000	of Meshach, Reschach, and Abendigo.
2700000	2701000	Shadrach Meshach.
2701000	2702000	Shadrach Meshach.
2702000	2703000	Yeah, Shadrach Meshach.
2703000	2704000	I really stuck with me.
2706000	2707000	They were protected by an angel
2707000	2708000	and they lived through a fire.
2708000	2709000	And so I had this orange glitter.
2710000	2712000	And everybody reached under their chair
2712000	2713000	and brought out the thing
2713000	2714000	and then got glitter all over them.
2714000	2716000	And I told the story.
2716000	2717000	Do you remember when we were preparing
2717000	2718000	for the wedding
2718000	2719000	and my dad was like,
2719000	2720000	don't give her any glitter.
2720000	2721000	That's because of that.
2721000	2723000	That's like Stella thing.
2723000	2724000	But yes, I did bring...
2724000	2725000	You're gonna sign that for the honeymoon.
2726000	2727000	I don't know what that means.
2727000	2728000	Oh, you should put three
2728000	2730000	specks of glitter on your penis.
2732000	2734000	I could probably fit three and a half.
2734000	2735000	Oh, no.
2735000	2736000	Stop.
2736000	2737000	Honey, you could fit thousands.
2737000	2738000	Millions.
2738000	2739000	There's a...
2739000	2740000	I do have an activity.
2740000	2742000	I have a little game corner activity.
2742000	2743000	I left a...
2743000	2746000	If someone can hand me the black book
2746000	2747000	that's back there.
2749000	2750000	Thank you.
2751000	2755000	I'm going to read my goals for 2015.
2756000	2757000	Not really.
2757000	2758000	Okay.
2758000	2759000	So if we could set up two mics
2759000	2761000	that are facing a camera
2761000	2764000	that look like presenter mics at the Oscars,
2764000	2767000	this is a game called Presenters.
2768000	2769000	Whoo!
2773000	2774000	Oscars.
2775000	2776000	Bang.
2777000	2779000	Jeff, can I switch places with you
2779000	2780000	for this game?
2780000	2781000	Thank you.
2781000	2784000	Jeff is wearing a lovely charcoal suit.
2786000	2788000	I'm not sure which...
2788000	2790000	Which camera should we...
2790000	2792000	It makes us look like we're presenting
2792000	2794000	at the Oscars.
2794000	2796000	This one or that one?
2797000	2798000	That one?
2798000	2799000	That one.
2799000	2800000	All right.
2800000	2802000	Is your red light your way of saying yes?
2802000	2805000	Well, actually, we'll share a mic.
2805000	2807000	They'll share a mic, so let's...
2808000	2809000	All right.
2809000	2810000	It is the year...
2810000	2811000	I'll take two mics.
2811000	2813000	It is the year 2020.
2813000	2815000	These are the Oscars,
2815000	2817000	and Jeff and Dan are going to be playing
2817000	2821000	various presenters at the Oscars,
2821000	2825000	presenting various awards.
2825000	2828000	And Dino and Lana, if you feel inspired
2828000	2830000	at any point to be a part of this,
2830000	2831000	you are welcome.
2831000	2833000	I'm doing it now.
2833000	2834000	Here we go.
2834000	2835000	I keep wondering if I should leave,
2835000	2836000	but here I am.
2836000	2837000	No, stay.
2839000	2841000	We're going to have the best night of our lives.
2841000	2845000	Welcome back to the 2020 Oscars,
2845000	2848000	live from the Olympia Theatre in beautiful
2848000	2850000	Petra B. Six Three Crater
2850000	2853000	on the dark side of the moon.
2856000	2860000	Presenting the award for best supporting actress
2860000	2866000	is Alan Cumming and Charlie Callis.
2872000	2873000	Work it.
2879000	2882000	Best supporting actresses are very important.
2882000	2884000	I think I'm British.
2886000	2887000	The thing about the...
2887000	2888000	The thing about the...
2888000	2889000	The thing about the...
2889000	2890000	The thing about the...
2890000	2891000	Whoa.
2891000	2892000	Why?
2895000	2897000	And the nominees are...
2899000	2901000	Jodie Foster.
2902000	2905000	For her role in Abadu's...
2907000	2909000	How come there's no Abadu's?
2910000	2912000	I won't do clips for each one.
2915000	2917000	I'll do the titles and give you all the clips.
2918000	2919000	Okay, all right.
2919000	2923000	Meryl Streep for The Virus in the Wind.
2926000	2927000	Exactly.
2927000	2929000	What are you talking about?
2932000	2933000	Renee Selwiger and...
2934000	2935000	Wow.
2936000	2937000	Shh.
2943000	2945000	And the Oscar goes to...
2946000	2947000	Jodie Foster.
2948000	2949000	Yay.
2949000	2950000	Okay.
2951000	2953000	All right, I think we did that wrong, right?
2954000	2955000	That was great.
2955000	2957000	And if I didn't establish this earlier,
2957000	2959000	they don't know who I'm going to say.
2959000	2961000	And also, they don't know who Charlie Callis is.
2962000	2963000	Okay.
2964000	2965000	All right.
2966000	2967000	Here we go.
2970000	2972000	Please welcome to the stage,
2972000	2978000	you know him from filling in that smaller crater.
2978000	2983000	And you know her as president of the dark side of the moon,
2983000	2987000	Alec Baldwin and Oprah Winfrey.
2992000	2994000	They will be presenting best...
2999000	3003000	Though they need no activity because we respect their power,
3003000	3007000	they will be presenting a best original song.
3008000	3012000	You know, they say that the song is the heart and soul of a movie.
3013000	3017000	And without a song, that the movie is not really the whole experience
3017000	3018000	that it ought to be.
3018000	3020000	It's the worst Oprah Winfrey ever heard.
3021000	3023000	I was going to say, hello, I'm Oprah Winfrey.
3041000	3045000	I got so depressed that I stole this joke I peed it on my pants.
3047000	3049000	The nominees are...
3051000	3061000	All right, later in the night, Drew Barrymore and Dakota Fanning
3061000	3065000	presented the Oscar for best original screenplay.
3070000	3072000	I get to do the easy one.
3072000	3073000	That's the worst.
3074000	3075000	Sorry, go ahead.
3076000	3081000	The writing of Kate Hudson's impression of Drew Barrymore
3081000	3085000	is what I'm doing right now and is magical.
3086000	3088000	Hello, I'm Dakota Fanning.
3089000	3092000	What's the top... what's the nomination again?
3092000	3093000	What's the category?
3093000	3095000	Original screenplay.
3095000	3097000	Well, shit, original screenplays.
3097000	3099000	I'm Dakota Fanning.
3099000	3107000	It does sound like... that name.
3107000	3109000	It's the name. It's the name.
3109000	3110000	I mean, I don't know who that is.
3110000	3112000	It sounds like an old-timey cowboy actor.
3113000	3115000	Oh, shit, I'm Dakota Fanning.
3116000	3119000	And the Oscar goes to Afri-Potty.
3121000	3124000	Finally, the night took a dramatic turn
3124000	3128000	and a moment that will be forever remembered in Oscar history
3128000	3132000	as the time it happened when Billy Crystal
3132000	3135000	and Benedict Cumberbatch presented Best Picture.
3140000	3143000	Come on, Billy Crystal's dead by then, right?
3143000	3144000	He's got to be.
3144000	3145000	Oh, no, I thought not.
3145000	3148000	No, I picture him like a Futurama head in a jar, right?
3148000	3149000	Oh, really? Okay.
3150000	3153000	Hey, hey, hey.
3154000	3155000	Hey.
3166000	3167000	Hey.
3167000	3169000	That is the worst Oprah Winfrey I've ever heard.
3169000	3172000	Yay, and that was Presenters.
3173000	3174000	All right.
3175000	3177000	That was a good segment.
3180000	3181000	All right.
3181000	3182000	That was dynamite.
3182000	3183000	That was fun.
3183000	3184000	Thanks.
3184000	3185000	Thank you for that.
3185000	3188000	I just want to show everybody my opposite
3188000	3190000	of a beautiful mind notes for...
3193000	3194000	All right.
3194000	3195000	Let's make sure...
3195000	3196000	Is it Lana?
3196000	3197000	Lana.
3197000	3198000	Lana.
3198000	3199000	Is it Land?
3200000	3202000	He might have thought it was Lana.
3202000	3203000	We know Lana.
3204000	3206000	Is Lana spelled differently from Lana?
3206000	3207000	No, no.
3208000	3209000	Lana was just...
3209000	3210000	Do you correct people?
3211000	3215000	Sometimes, if it seems like they're going to be saying my name a lot, but generally...
3215000	3218000	One is really the way you say it, Lana.
3218000	3220000	That bitch was out of her mind.
3221000	3222000	Yeah, fuck her.
3222000	3223000	She's the worst.
3223000	3224000	Yeah, she was a cunt.
3224000	3225000	Just the worst.
3227000	3230000	I kind of feel like there's a thing happening with Dino and Lana right now.
3230000	3232000	I feel like it's happening.
3232000	3233000	Oh, yeah.
3233000	3234000	Well, don't kill it.
3234000	3236000	I don't think it can be killed.
3236000	3237000	I think that Dino's sexuality is...
3237000	3240000	I'm going to whisper sweet nothings in here right now.
3241000	3242000	Nigger.
3246000	3248000	It's my catchphrase, people.
3250000	3251000	Oh, man.
3251000	3252000	It always works.
3254000	3255000	Such a hard R.
3259000	3260000	All right.
3260000	3265000	Well, Lana, Lana, what do you think?
3266000	3267000	What do I think?
3267000	3268000	Oh, boy.
3268000	3269000	You got a new book coming out?
3271000	3272000	Dick pics.
3272000	3276000	I'm trying to figure out a way to put a ribbon on it, not the dick.
3276000	3280000	Lana, I see you've come here with a gentleman tonight.
3280000	3281000	Are you guys involved?
3281000	3282000	No.
3283000	3284000	No, no.
3284000	3285000	He's here visiting from Texas.
3285000	3287000	Oh, we'll say no more.
3287000	3288000	If you want to sleep with him before...
3288000	3289000	It's cool.
3289000	3290000	I can fuck him.
3290000	3291000	Okay, good.
3291000	3292000	I mean, as long as he's okay with that.
3292000	3293000	He's okay with it.
3293000	3294000	As long as he's okay with that.
3294000	3295000	I just want to make sure the girl...
3295000	3296000	He won't know what hit him, believe me.
3297000	3299000	Do you think the threesome guy...
3299000	3305000	Was he supposed to also have sex with you, or was he supposed to just have sex with the woman alongside you?
3305000	3309000	I was probably going to, like, lick his cum off her or something like that.
3309000	3310000	I mean, if you're into it.
3310000	3311000	Oh, fuck it!
3311000	3312000	If you're into it.
3312000	3314000	You guys are precious.
3314000	3315000	Yes.
3315000	3317000	They didn't boo the end bomb as hard as that.
3317000	3318000	Yeah.
3318000	3320000	That's exactly what I was thinking.
3321000	3328000	There's got to be at least one African-American Parmesan fan here tonight that's just like, wait a minute.
3329000	3331000	Yeah, I think it's too lost on me.
3332000	3337000	I'm going to go home and ask myself a lot of questions about society.
3338000	3340000	I would lick his cum off of anyone.
3341000	3342000	Oh, man.
3342000	3343000	Now, nothing.
3343000	3347000	Well, the best thing I can come up with to maybe end me being on stage...
3347000	3349000	Not that this wasn't lovely, and thank you for having me.
3349000	3350000	It's so boring.
3350000	3357000	I used to ask when I was in high school and thought I was clever, would ask all the guys that I knew how they thought of their penis.
3357000	3360000	Was it a tool, a trophy, or a toy?
3361000	3362000	A trophy?
3362000	3363000	And it was an interesting kind of pole.
3363000	3364000	A tool, a trophy.
3364000	3367000	Well, Dan, you said yours was practical, so I'm going to go with tool with yours, right?
3368000	3369000	Or a toy.
3369000	3370000	A toy.
3370000	3374000	Well, I mean, it's a toy until you get married, and then it's a tool, right?
3380000	3382000	Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
3387000	3388000	A totem.
3389000	3390000	What was that?
3390000	3391000	What is the...
3391000	3392000	Is a tool, a trophy, or...
3392000	3393000	Okay, yeah, yeah.
3393000	3394000	Yeah, it's all a key word.
3394000	3396000	I'm trying to figure out how it could ever be a trophy.
3396000	3399000	Like, I guess if it was really big?
3399000	3400000	Yeah.
3400000	3401000	Like...
3401000	3402000	It doesn't have to be big.
3402000	3404000	Because how do you win a dick?
3405000	3406000	Come over here.
3406000	3407000	A god?
3409000	3410000	What did you say?
3410000	3411000	I said, come over here.
3411000	3412000	I'll show you that.
3413000	3415000	You wrap it in, like, gold ribbon.
3415000	3416000	That's right.
3416000	3417000	Right.
3417000	3418000	But it's your own.
3418000	3419000	I mean, I understand how someone else could win it.
3419000	3427000	Like, I consider all of my wieners collaborators to be winners in some way.
3427000	3431000	I hope they're not feeling like they lost something.
3431000	3434000	But I took the trophy with me, and also...
3434000	3435000	Never mind.
3436000	3439000	I mean, would you have licked the...
3439000	3440000	I love my dick.
3440000	3441000	Oh.
3441000	3442000	Oh, what are you asking me?
3442000	3443000	Would you have licked the...
3443000	3444000	Come off it.
3444000	3447000	Yeah, it doesn't matter to me.
3447000	3448000	It's all...
3448000	3450000	We're all, you know, one organism.
3451000	3452000	We're all made of stars.
3452000	3453000	All made of stars.
3453000	3454000	Yeah.
3455000	3456000	All right.
3456000	3461000	Well, any parting thoughts if you want...
3461000	3462000	No, that puts you on the spot.
3462000	3465000	I'm always feeling like I don't want to deprive people of their moment.
3465000	3467000	You could just leave if you want.
3468000	3469000	Lana!
3469000	3471000	Yeah, Lana!
3480000	3482000	I don't have any final thoughts either.
3483000	3484000	Yeah.
3485000	3491000	I'm bad at interviewing, and I'm bad at figuring out when to...
3491000	3492000	I think you're good.
3492000	3493000	You're a nice guy.
3494000	3495000	I didn't want her to leave.
3495000	3497000	You thank them and you say...
3498000	3499000	No, she was fine.
3499000	3500000	She was fine.
3500000	3506000	I always feel like the Wisconsin in me wants to be ironic about it.
3506000	3508000	I don't want to just...
3508000	3510000	I don't want to be like Craig Kilborn.
3510000	3512000	I feel perfectly respected.
3512000	3513000	Oh, yeah.
3513000	3515000	No, I wasn't worried about you, lady.
3515000	3516000	No.
3516000	3517000	No, no.
3518000	3521000	It's just a spineless thing.
3521000	3522000	I don't want to take charge.
3522000	3523000	I don't want to be like...
3523000	3524000	I don't want to be like...
3524000	3531000	I don't like the idea of me coming across as having the pretense that the show has any direction at all.
3531000	3532000	That's what it is.
3532000	3534000	Like, okay, let's keep it going.
3534000	3537000	Come on, let's thank her as if we have better stuff to do.
3538000	3541000	I don't need you guys to talk right now either.
3542000	3543000	Yeah.
3543000	3544000	Well, that's so funny.
3545000	3548000	Well, not so spineless anymore.
3549000	3555000	Dan, do you think it's because you're wearing a tux that you feel like now there's suddenly a structure to the show?
3555000	3556000	No, no, no, no.
3556000	3557000	This is...
3557000	3558000	I'm expressing a thing.
3558000	3562000	I'm open sourcing my experience as I do the show for years.
3562000	3563000	I've always done this.
3563000	3565000	I've always had trouble at the end of...
3565000	3566000	Is this your first fight?
3566000	3568000	Of people.
3568000	3570000	Like, whether it's Greg Proops or anybody.
3570000	3574000	I never know if I'm supposed to go like, okay, thank him for coming.
3574000	3578000	It just feels like such an odd thing to be the person that says, all right, this phone call's over.
3578000	3580000	It's just a lot of power to...
3580000	3581000	Right, but it's not me.
3581000	3588000	It's a gift as opposed to putting somebody on the spot and saying, you need to prove that you're...
3588000	3589000	No, yeah, I get that now.
3589000	3590000	I'm working through this.
3590000	3591000	I get that.
3591000	3592000	He doesn't need you to talk, lady.
3592000	3593000	Yeah.
3594000	3596000	But if you just had a stroke and you're like, who are you?
3596000	3597000	What are you wearing?
3597000	3598000	What's going on?
3598000	3599000	Come, come, come.
3599000	3600000	Go, go, go.
3600000	3601000	Chicken, chicken, chicken, grease.
3605000	3607000	I didn't get a big laugh, but I liked it.
3610000	3611000	I just play that song.
3611000	3612000	I just want...
3612000	3613000	I got it in my head.
3613000	3614000	It's a good song, right?
3614000	3615000	Yeah.
3615000	3616000	What's this guy's name again?
3616000	3617000	Kevin MacLeod.
3617000	3621000	It's all this free online stuff I just found a bunch of in a rush to get like some music to play.
3621000	3623000	And I think we got to make this guy famous.
3630000	3633000	See, it's always, it's always on the wrong...
3633000	3634000	Let's try it from the top.
3634000	3635000	From the top.
3635000	3636000	You ready, Dan?
3636000	3637000	Okay.
3637000	3638000	This is a real craving.
3638000	3640000	Dan, I want you to sing less like you're about to die.
3640000	3641000	Yeah.
3659000	3684000	We don't know what's up.
3684000	3686000	You up for money.
3686000	3688000	I'm a hire killer.
3688000	3690000	Got a knife in my shoe.
3690000	3691000	Cha.
3691000	3693000	Cha, cha, cha.
3693000	3695000	King's been sucked.
3695000	3698000	It's a shitty movie.
3698000	3703000	That movie sucked, and if you liked it, you're a sociopath.
3705000	3710000	It was a toxicly bereft film about nothing at all.
3710000	3711000	Beep, beep.
3711000	3712000	Chook-a-choo.
3712000	3713000	Forty-two.
3713000	3715000	Can't go to movies.
3715000	3716000	Anymore.
3716000	3717000	King's been sucked.
3717000	3718000	Out the door.
3718000	3720000	Stupid, knife-foot lady.
3720000	3721000	Just head bangs.
3721000	3723000	Doesn't have a character.
3723000	3724000	Ooh.
3724000	3726000	Sam Jackson had a lisp.
3726000	3727000	It's a choice.
3727000	3728000	He's an actor.
3728000	3731000	Really embarrassing to sit through.
3731000	3734000	That movie was fucked up, man.
3734000	3737000	That movie was so fucked up.
3738000	3743000	We'll be out of breath for a couple weeks.
3743000	3747000	That song was called Sidewalk Out of Sight.
3747000	3751000	Even with all that irony, I still feel old.
3751000	3753000	I just don't understand anything.
3753000	3754000	Just because I'm so groovy?
3754000	3755000	Yeah, yeah.
3755000	3757000	You're thinking, like, why are these kids here?
3757000	3758000	Why do they pay $10?
3758000	3760000	Yeah, why do they care about you?
3760000	3761000	Tonight's not good.
3761000	3762000	I mean, I like you.
3762000	3763000	You're a nice guy.
3763000	3764000	But what the fuck?
3764000	3766000	What's everyone here for?
3766000	3770000	Tonight's not the night that it's evident why.
3770000	3775000	It's more of a long-term relationship you have, I think.
3775000	3776000	You know, look at it.
3776000	3780000	Like, do we have the night off, maybe?
3780000	3783000	Family?
3783000	3784000	It's a bad movie.
3784000	3786000	It's a movie about dressing nice, I guess,
3786000	3788000	and having knives for feet.
3792000	3795000	A left-wing critique of spy movies.
3796000	3799000	The capital is, a person decides to save the world
3799000	3801000	by only allowing a lead to having all the core.
3801000	3802000	Bring him up.
3802000	3804000	Bring him up.
3804000	3805000	Fuck you!
3805000	3806000	Come here!
3806000	3809000	Come here!
3809000	3812000	If you want to come up and do a three-minute endorsement
3812000	3815000	of Kingsman, I just found it to be
3815000	3819000	a profoundly toxic piece of garbage.
3819000	3821000	I agree.
3821000	3824000	But it's clearly controversial, and here's why.
3824000	3827000	Because it's childish nonsense, and then every time they make
3827000	3829000	a movie that includes childish nonsense, if there's a dinosaur
3829000	3831000	or a robot in it, or a lady with knife feet,
3831000	3834000	or it's based on a comic book, which is everything now,
3834000	3836000	then we all feel like it's religion,
3836000	3838000	and we all have to argue about it.
3838000	3840000	All of a sudden, it's important whether you have the,
3840000	3842000	if you're the Jew that has the curly thingies,
3842000	3846000	or whether you have the special hat, or both.
3846000	3849000	It becomes high stakes when nerds encounter each other
3849000	3852000	over cigarettes in the alley about the fucking movie
3852000	3854000	that came out.
3854000	3857000	It's important to know, for us,
3857000	3859000	is this a good thing or a bad thing?
3859000	3861000	I'm 42. It's a whole different topic for me.
3861000	3863000	These movies are just getting dumber and dumber.
3863000	3865000	I'm telling you, I'm sorry.
3865000	3868000	I just didn't like Guardians of the Galaxy.
3868000	3870000	I'm so bored. I'm so tired.
3870000	3875000	I just play Minecraft, and I just go to sleep.
3875000	3879000	I think that movies are for people who,
3879000	3881000	it's the third movie you've seen.
3881000	3883000	The third movie you've seen, then it's good.
3883000	3885000	The third movie I saw was Die Hard.
3885000	3887000	I think we should revisit Guardians of the Galaxy,
3887000	3889000	because I think it is a great movie.
3889000	3891000	I did see it on a hotel room TV.
3891000	3893000	We'll watch the game.
3893000	3895000	Have you seen Boyhood?
3895000	3897000	No, I haven't seen it.
3897000	3899000	It's a really good movie.
3899000	3900000	The thing about good movies is,
3900000	3901000	generally good movies are like,
3901000	3903000	I'm never in the mood to watch them.
3903000	3905000	I'm like, oh, Boyhood, that sounds like it's going to
3905000	3907000	break my fucking heart.
3907000	3909000	Speaking of Boyhood,
3909000	3912000	before we left, Patricia Raquette won the Oscar
3912000	3916000	for Best Supporting Actress.
3916000	3918000	On the red carpet, Dan and I were watching
3918000	3921000	red carpet footage, and she was being interviewed.
3921000	3924000	She said, one of the things I really like about me
3924000	3927000	is how much I care about other people.
3927000	3930000	She said, what do I like about me, really?
3930000	3933000	Yeah, that's literally what she said, almost verbatim.
3933000	3935000	Then they said, let's hear from your daughter.
3935000	3937000	They're introducing a new Arquette to us.
3937000	3939000	And you can see here in her daughter's eyes,
3939000	3943000	where she's like, oh, say what she wants me to say.
3943000	3945000	Yeah, I guess this is a great time,
3945000	3950000	because my mom, she's come a long way
3950000	3953000	because people are finally starting to recognize her.
3953000	3956000	I was like, oh, man, don't feed your daughter lines
3956000	3959000	on the SUV on the way to the...
3959000	3961000	These are Arquettes.
3961000	3962000	I was reading tweets, but...
3962000	3964000	She's a real carnation of...
3964000	3966000	I went in the other room because it was playing loud
3966000	3968000	and Dan and I weren't in the same room when that happened,
3968000	3970000	and I said, ah, 45 seconds.
3970000	3972000	That's the amount of time it takes for me to go
3972000	3975000	from loving Patricia Arquette to not.
3975000	3977000	What was this guy yelling about over here?
3977000	3979000	Somebody was yelling. Who was yelling?
3979000	3981000	What the fuck?
3981000	3983000	What was the what the fuck?
3983000	3984000	No, no, no.
3984000	3986000	I mean, like, people were looking at me and saying...
3986000	3988000	Oh, oh.
3988000	3990000	We accidentally...
3990000	3992000	No, I was yelling a lot of stuff.
3992000	3993000	Oh, okay.
3994000	3995000	Is that Dakota fans?
3995000	3997000	Is there any way...
3997000	3999000	Is there any way to tell the carnation story?
3999000	4001000	I think enough time has passed, right?
4001000	4002000	Okay, all right.
4002000	4004000	So don't let this get out of the room.
4006000	4008000	Tell it again. You told it. It's a great story.
4008000	4010000	We did? The carnation story? Okay.
4010000	4011000	We told it.
4011000	4012000	Here? On this show?
4012000	4013000	Yeah.
4013000	4014000	On this television show?
4014000	4015000	Yeah.
4015000	4016000	Okay. All right.
4016000	4018000	What's the story?
4018000	4019000	The carnation story.
4019000	4021000	The authors in Kardashian's story.
4021000	4023000	I don't know any Kardashian's story.
4023000	4026000	We were writing a pilot for...
4026000	4028000	David Arquette was giving us notes, and he...
4028000	4032000	And he kept using the word carnation for incarnation.
4032000	4033000	Right.
4033000	4036000	Like, he's like, this is a carnation of that.
4036000	4040000	And I wasn't listening to his words.
4040000	4042000	I was listening to his meaning more.
4042000	4045000	And I was like, fuck him. It's not a...
4045000	4047000	And finally, I burst out.
4047000	4050000	And, you know, Dan and Jay Johnston were there.
4050000	4052000	And I was like...
4052000	4053000	And I finally burst out, and I said,
4053000	4055000	it's not a carnation of that.
4055000	4057000	It's a carnation of this.
4057000	4060000	And I was like, Jesus Christ, don't fucking make fun of him
4060000	4062000	on top of everything that we're going through.
4062000	4064000	And I see them out of the corner of my eyes,
4064000	4066000	kind of like, like, burying their heads.
4066000	4067000	And I'm like, what a...
4067000	4068000	And I'm like...
4068000	4069000	And I think they're making fun of me.
4069000	4070000	I'm like, carnation...
4070000	4072000	Oh, I'm saying carnation instead of incorrect.
4072000	4075000	And I've out loud, I said, carnation?
4075000	4078000	What am I, a fucking retard?
4078000	4080000	Like, he didn't... Yeah.
4080000	4084000	And I had no idea I was repeating David Arquette's word.
4084000	4086000	And they thought I was a hero.
4086000	4088000	Like, wow, this fucking guy.
4088000	4091000	I did not think you were a hero.
4091000	4094000	I mean, I didn't think you were a villain, but...
4094000	4098000	I knew at that moment I was blessed to have you in my life,
4098000	4101000	but I didn't think you were a hero.
4101000	4102000	Like, I was just...
4102000	4104000	I thought our life was a movie.
4104000	4107000	I wasn't sure if there was a central character or not.
4107000	4109000	Speaking of Dave Johnson, are you allowed to say
4109000	4112000	what you're... the cool thing that you're working on right now?
4112000	4114000	Well, it's a...
4114000	4117000	A lot of the people from Mr. Show are working on something.
4117000	4119000	It's not gonna be on HBO.
4119000	4121000	Mrs. Movie?
4121000	4123000	Yeah.
4123000	4126000	Yeah, it's Bob and David are doing a sketch show,
4126000	4129000	and a lot of the original writers are doing it.
4129000	4132000	I don't know where it's gonna be yet, they're not telling me.
4132000	4134000	But...
4134000	4136000	But it's going to air somewhere.
4136000	4139000	And, yeah, we're doing a sketch show.
4139000	4141000	And, yeah.
4143000	4145000	Netflix!
4146000	4148000	Probably Netflix.
4150000	4152000	He said probably everyone.
4154000	4156000	All right, well, let's bring Spencer out.
4156000	4158000	Spencer!
4159000	4161000	Hey, guys.
4161000	4163000	What's up, Spencer?
4163000	4165000	Hi, Spencer.
4165000	4166000	Hey, Dino.
4166000	4168000	I like your haircut, Dino.
4168000	4169000	Thanks.
4169000	4171000	You know, I woke up one morning in New York
4171000	4174000	and drank a half a bottle of vodka and chopped it all off.
4174000	4175000	Yourself?
4175000	4176000	Yeah.
4176000	4177000	That's impressive, right?
4177000	4178000	Yeah.
4178000	4179000	It was amazing.
4179000	4180000	It was amazing.
4180000	4181000	It was amazing.
4181000	4182000	It was amazing.
4182000	4183000	It was amazing.
4183000	4184000	It was amazing.
4184000	4185000	It was amazing.
4185000	4186000	It was amazing.
4186000	4187000	It was amazing.
4187000	4188000	That's impressive, right?
4188000	4189000	Yeah.
4189000	4191000	It was a work in progress for a while.
4191000	4192000	You cut your own hair?
4192000	4193000	Yeah, yeah.
4193000	4194000	How?
4194000	4195000	I don't know.
4195000	4197000	I was fucking drunk.
4197000	4198000	With scissors?
4198000	4200000	Oh, yeah, probably.
4201000	4203000	No, it's an obsidian knife.
4204000	4205000	Nice.
4206000	4207000	I always...
4207000	4210000	I cut them with lesbian legs.
4212000	4213000	I don't know.
4213000	4216000	They say that that's a myth, but those don't work for haircuts.
4218000	4222000	I always fantasize about that.
4222000	4224000	You look in the mirror and you go, why not?
4224000	4225000	I mean, come on.
4225000	4226000	What was this?
4226000	4227000	You could do it.
4227000	4228000	You don't care how you look.
4228000	4229000	Yeah.
4229000	4231000	I mean, now I guess I do, but...
4231000	4232000	You do?
4232000	4235000	When I was a kid, I did it once, and then I got ashamed for it.
4235000	4236000	You're married now.
4236000	4237000	Why would you care how you look?
4237000	4240000	I'm a spokesman for a major...
4240000	4243000	I'm going to go to South by Southwest to take pictures.
4243000	4245000	Are you a spokesman now?
4245000	4246000	For Yahoo.
4246000	4247000	I've been following you.
4247000	4251000	For the show, the show's rolling out, so there's going to be pictures of me.
4251000	4252000	Oh, pictures of you?
4252000	4255000	They're making him wear a text that looks like an exclamation point.
4255000	4256000	Okay.
4256000	4257000	Sorry about sliding the show down.
4259000	4261000	And we're doing a harm in town from South by Southwest, right?
4261000	4262000	Yeah.
4262000	4263000	Yeah.
4263000	4264000	Yeah, we'll be there.
4265000	4266000	That's good news for you guys.
4268000	4269000	We're flying you all out.
4271000	4275000	Spencer, I always like to hear about what's going on with you in the world of current events.
4276000	4277000	Oh, boy.
4278000	4279000	So many things.
4280000	4283000	I'm really just firing on all cylinders today.
4284000	4286000	What currently gets your goat?
4286000	4289000	Is there a thing going on geopolitically or scientifically?
4289000	4290000	What's your beef?
4290000	4291000	What's your beef?
4291000	4299000	I just heard a radio commercial on the radio for Lyft, the car share service.
4299000	4300000	Nift?
4300000	4301000	For Lyft.
4301000	4302000	Oh.
4302000	4303000	And it really got my goat.
4303000	4304000	Okay.
4304000	4305000	Let me try something else.
4306000	4311000	I listened to the KKK.
4312000	4315000	I disagree with most of their views.
4316000	4317000	They're losing focus.
4317000	4322000	Their headlines kind of closed the conversation off, but the truth is, they're flat taxers.
4322000	4323000	Yeah, they're financial advice.
4323000	4325000	They really have some very interesting economic...
4326000	4327000	It makes a lot of sense.
4328000	4329000	No, okay.
4329000	4330000	I listened to these conversations.
4330000	4331000	They really nigger their economy.
4331000	4332000	God, stop it.
4332000	4333000	Why?
4334000	4335000	I can't.
4335000	4338000	I mean, it'd be shocking if you didn't say it.
4338000	4339000	I know.
4339000	4340000	That's what I was thinking.
4344000	4346000	Shut up from the peanut gallery.
4347000	4349000	The black guy over in the back.
4350000	4355000	The black guys are looking at the floor and going, tell me when it's over.
4355000	4356000	No, man.
4356000	4361000	Spencer backstage when they were joking about your dick being a 20-sided dick.
4363000	4369000	I couldn't tell, but you were like, were you secretly grinning?
4370000	4372000	I had to say I was openly grinning, I don't know.
4372000	4373000	Oh, okay.
4373000	4375000	It wasn't like there's any, yeah.
4375000	4377000	Right now I got an O.C. report.
4377000	4383000	Mr. Spencer, if you could describe your penis as a mythical creature from the D&D universe.
4384000	4385000	What would it most resemble?
4386000	4387000	What do you call it?
4387000	4388000	A thokwa.
4389000	4390000	That's like a...
4391000	4392000	Oh.
4392000	4393000	Sorry.
4393000	4394000	Hold on.
4394000	4395000	Hold on.
4395000	4396000	Start back up.
4396000	4397000	What?
4397000	4400000	I thought you just meant to pick a monster that it was the most light.
4400000	4401000	Okay.
4401000	4402000	Yeah.
4402000	4403000	I could describe it.
4403000	4404000	Sure.
4405000	4408000	Looming in the distance.
4410000	4416000	Heavy with the musk of 14 woodland creatures.
4417000	4421000	Floating imperiously through the forest path.
4422000	4423000	I don't know.
4424000	4429000	I like that I'm going to use that covering technique from a distance.
4431000	4432000	That's a good cover.
4432000	4434000	Yeah, you can't tell.
4434000	4438000	I really like the dramatic music in him saying, I don't know.
4439000	4442000	I will show you the first word you're going to say was rising.
4443000	4445000	Dan, you want to give it a try for your dick, Dan?
4445000	4446000	Yeah.
4446000	4447000	Okay, ready?
4448000	4458000	From a really far, far place away, so far that you can't tell its dimensions, an impressively
4458000	4469000	simplistic pink monolith switches from its pivot point on the lower abdomen of the voice
4469000	4476000	of a new generation, dribbling with fiscus pre-cum.
4481000	4482000	Do my dick.
4482000	4483000	Do my dick.
4486000	4487000	Same music?
4487000	4488000	Same music, yeah.
4490000	4492000	There's nothing mysterious about it.
4492000	4494000	You all have pictures.
4494000	4496000	Look at your phone right now.
4496000	4498000	I've texted all of you.
4499000	4500000	That's it.
4501000	4502000	All right, Aaron, you're pussy.
4505000	4507000	Unseen by the naked eye.
4511000	4523000	Needing a magnifying glass and straws of light to pry it open tighter than any tight and deep,
4523000	4524000	but not too deep.
4524000	4525000	Too deep.
4527000	4531000	Containing the secrets of 14 creatures.
4534000	4535000	15, 15 here.
4538000	4539000	Another guy showed up.
4542000	4546000	I wonder if the kid who tweeted me that he was 17 years old and he was coming to the
4546000	4551000	show, if he was wondering if he could come to the show at 17 if he came tonight.
4552000	4553000	Are you here?
4553000	4554000	17?
4554000	4555000	You're here?
4555000	4556000	All right, see, that's good.
4556000	4557000	I heard something.
4557000	4558000	But that's fine, right?
4558000	4561000	Like a Seth Rogen movie talks about dicks and cum and stuff.
4561000	4562000	Who cares?
4562000	4564000	I learned the truth at 17.
4566000	4569000	Now you wouldn't lose your virginity for another seven years.
4571000	4572000	It's true, right?
4572000	4573000	24 years old?
4573000	4574000	24.
4574000	4575000	I lost my virginity at 24.
4575000	4577000	And Dina was mad because I beat you.
4577000	4579000	Yeah, he beats me at everything.
4579000	4580000	24?
4580000	4582000	Even losing my virginity.
4582000	4583000	I was a very late bloomer.
4583000	4584000	I was...
4585000	4586000	Jesus.
4587000	4588000	There are some...
4588000	4590000	There are some Rudy's in the audience.
4590000	4594000	I was 23 when I lost my virginity, but I suck cock at 12.
4594000	4595000	Seriously.
4595000	4596000	Really?
4596000	4597000	Yeah.
4597000	4598000	You sucked your first dick at 12?
4598000	4599000	No, you didn't.
4599000	4600000	Yeah.
4600000	4601000	You're lying.
4601000	4602000	No, I swear to God.
4602000	4604000	Well, he was 12 too, so it was cool.
4606000	4607000	Were you pals?
4607000	4608000	Were you like playground buddies?
4608000	4609000	Yeah, we...
4609000	4611000	There were frenemies.
4612000	4613000	You met him.
4613000	4615000	You say met him, yes.
4616000	4618000	We tried to have a threesome with you.
4618000	4619000	No, we didn't.
4621000	4622000	You rushed to make sure.
4622000	4623000	No, no, whatever.
4623000	4624000	Yeah, well, I saw your eyes.
4624000	4626000	Don't stop coming around.
4628000	4631000	He's like, is that what that pitch for an adult swim show was?
4634000	4636000	Did you and Andy ever have any mess around?
4636000	4638000	No, he never hit on me.
4638000	4639000	I'm so upset.
4639000	4640000	You're the only one.
4640000	4641000	Yeah.
4641000	4643000	I mean, I'm not attracted to him, but fuck him.
4643000	4645000	I was in a hotel room at Disneyland.
4645000	4647000	Of course, he wants you really badly.
4647000	4648000	And there was a girl there.
4648000	4649000	We're getting better.
4649000	4652000	And he was trying to fuck everybody in the building,
4652000	4654000	and he's just the most rampant...
4654000	4655000	Yeah, except me.
4655000	4656000	Except you.
4656000	4657000	Yeah, nothing.
4657000	4658000	What's that about?
4658000	4659000	I don't know.
4659000	4660000	I'm ugly.
4660000	4661000	Yeah, poor me.
4661000	4662000	Not in New York, you're not.
4662000	4663000	No, I know.
4664000	4665000	Get over here.
4666000	4671000	All right, well, so we're going to play Shadowrun now.
4676000	4679000	Dino, you were not a team player.
4679000	4680000	With Dungeons and Dragons.
4680000	4682000	But Shadowrun sounds fun.
4685000	4687000	Fuck all of you.
4688000	4691000	I don't have to like anything you like.
4691000	4695000	Spencer is in charge of the role-playing section.
4695000	4697000	Do you think that, not to put you on the spot,
4697000	4699000	but should Dino leave?
4699000	4700000	Yeah, I should leave.
4700000	4702000	Please, have me leave.
4702000	4704000	Well, what if Dino can watch it,
4704000	4706000	and we can hear what he thinks of it after?
4706000	4707000	He could do a little rapping.
4707000	4710000	Maybe I'll come back and talk about it,
4710000	4711000	and make fun of you.
4711000	4713000	How about he stays up here, but doesn't play?
4713000	4715000	No, I want to go.
4716000	4717000	You want to go?
4717000	4718000	Yeah, there's a bar around the corner.
4718000	4719000	Well, let's all thank Dino.
4720000	4723000	There I did it.
4725000	4726000	Thank you, Dino.
4745000	4747000	Dan, would you pass out the character sheets for us,
4747000	4748000	since you're up?
4748000	4749000	Character sheets!
4751000	4754000	Spencer, do you want to do an intro from last time?
4754000	4756000	Well, I mean, I can do one.
4756000	4759000	I was just, last time we had Dan do a recap,
4759000	4761000	and I really liked that.
4761000	4762000	I don't know if Dan remembers.
4762000	4765000	Well, I don't remember this time as much.
4765000	4768000	Does Jeff remember anything, or any of you?
4768000	4772000	I remember that we killed those guards up front,
4772000	4775000	and we went back into the warehouse.
4775000	4778000	I cast a fart spirit that went under the door,
4778000	4781000	and knocked out three drug addict, kind of like workers,
4781000	4784000	and then two guys escaped, and there was a seam in the wall
4784000	4786000	that was clearly a door that they had used to escape from.
4786000	4789000	So we are either in pursuit of them, which I imagine we are.
4789000	4793000	If you just play, like, synth music while you do this...
4793000	4794000	Is Demarj here?
4794000	4796000	Oh, is Demarj here?
4796000	4797000	Jesus.
4797000	4798000	Is Demarj?
4798000	4799000	No, Demarj?
4799000	4800000	Going once?
4800000	4801000	No, Demarj.
4802000	4803000	What are we going to do?
4803000	4805000	We need our eye in the sky.
4806000	4807000	We need that.
4807000	4808000	We need that.
4808000	4809000	Can somebody play Demarj?
4809000	4810000	Spencer, that's your call.
4810000	4811000	Hey, I don't care.
4811000	4812000	Who knows Demarj?
4812000	4813000	Wait, is it a gal?
4813000	4814000	Right here.
4814000	4815000	Oh, yeah.
4815000	4816000	You are there.
4816000	4817000	Let's get a woman up here to play.
4817000	4818000	Yeah, you can come on up.
4825000	4829000	Well, her actual name is Meg Ryan on Oscar night.
4830000	4832000	We need to go to the Oscars tonight.
4832000	4833000	She wasn't invited.
4833000	4836000	She doesn't deserve to be invited.
4836000	4837000	Who is this guy over there?
4837000	4838000	What's going on over there?
4838000	4839000	She doesn't, right.
4839000	4841000	He's having a tough time over there.
4841000	4844000	My heart kind of goes out to him because at one point we were like,
4844000	4845000	hey, what's going on?
4845000	4847000	And then everyone looked at me and went, what, what, what?
4847000	4848000	Nothing's going on.
4848000	4849000	It's not important.
4849000	4850000	What?
4850000	4851000	Is this important?
4851000	4852000	No.
4852000	4853000	He's okay.
4853000	4856000	I mean, people come here to work stuff out, I guess.
4857000	4862000	The nine people sitting around you didn't come here to work anything out,
4862000	4865000	but I'll give them five bucks after the show.
4865000	4869000	I feel like I feel like we have the more like kind of baritone activated Adam
4869000	4870000	Goldberg over there.
4870000	4871000	He is like a.
4874000	4875000	You did it to yourself.
4875000	4877000	Spoken like an Adam Goldberg.
4879000	4880000	Yeah.
4880000	4881000	Do you know him?
4881000	4882000	You're kind of talking to him like you know him.
4882000	4885000	No, I don't know him at all, but I know who Adam Goldberg is.
4885000	4886000	So here we are.
4889000	4890000	Are you on methadone?
4890000	4891000	What's going on over there?
4892000	4896000	It's like it's like the Adam Goldberg 45 played at 78.
4899000	4902000	Aren't you going to pay attention to me?
4907000	4909000	Meg is the reason why you go by Megan at Megan.
4910000	4914000	I was a very young child when a small elementary school teacher said,
4914000	4916000	Oh, Meg Ryan, like the actress.
4916000	4919000	And then they never let you say in acting.
4919000	4920000	And so it's funny.
4921000	4922000	Are you mad at me for asking?
4924000	4925000	I feel like you're going to hit me.
4926000	4927000	No.
4927000	4929000	If you were the first, it would be cute.
4929000	4930000	If you were the 50th, it's still cute.
4930000	4931000	And so you're 50th.
4931000	4932000	So it's fine.
4932000	4933000	I mean, you brought it up.
4933000	4934000	You walked up.
4934000	4935000	You said yes, really.
4935000	4936000	I did.
4936000	4937000	OK.
4937000	4938000	Well, this is going to be great.
4940000	4941000	Cool energy.
4942000	4944000	Me to the yow.
4945000	4947000	I misinterpreted her energy, too.
4947000	4948000	I thought she knew that guy.
4948000	4950000	I think she's just an assertive person.
4950000	4951000	What is your station in life?
4951000	4952000	Do you?
4952000	4960000	I hope that you are a forensics detective or a DMV supervisor.
4960000	4961000	I just play them on TV.
4961000	4962000	It's fine.
4962000	4963000	Oh, you're an actor.
4963000	4964000	Yes.
4964000	4965000	Oh, OK.
4965000	4966000	Oh, boy.
4966000	4967000	Your name's Meg Ryan?
4967000	4968000	Yes.
4968000	4969000	Good luck.
4969000	4970000	Yep.
4970000	4973000	This is the first time I've heard it.
4973000	4974000	There's a weird energy overall.
4974000	4976000	I wonder if it's not a joke.
4976000	4979000	I wonder if it's because everyone's kind of grieving.
4979000	4983000	There's like a sadness in the air, even if you don't know what it is.
4983000	4984000	Sure.
4984000	4985000	Yeah.
4985000	4986000	I don't know.
4986000	4987000	Can we go back?
4987000	4988000	Not to make this about me.
4988000	4991000	But it was a pretty good Alec Baldwin I was doing there.
4991000	4994000	I have to say that was a good Alec Baldwin.
4994000	4995000	It was.
4995000	4996000	That was great.
4996000	4997000	It was great.
4997000	4999000	I've never really tried to do an Alec Baldwin in front of people.
4999000	5001000	I thought you should have done Oprah.
5001000	5002000	Pardon?
5002000	5003000	I thought you should have done Oprah.
5003000	5004000	Oprah.
5004000	5005000	So there's that.
5005000	5006000	Now you're on my dick.
5006000	5007000	No, I'm kidding.
5007000	5008000	Not yet.
5008000	5013000	Do you remember when we found out I do a pretty good Terrence Howard?
5013000	5014000	Yes.
5014000	5015000	Yeah.
5015000	5016000	Yeah.
5016000	5017000	Which is the same.
5017000	5018000	It's the same.
5018000	5019000	Sounds the same.
5019000	5021000	One of you three Negroes is going to step up.
5021000	5023000	It's a quote from Empire.
5023000	5025000	Take over my record label.
5025000	5026000	Wait, is he Irish?
5026000	5028000	No, he's Terrence Howard.
5029000	5030000	Take over my record label.
5030000	5035000	I want you to do that song again, only do it like your mother was being shot.
5036000	5037000	Didn't you?
5037000	5038000	Was it?
5038000	5039000	Am I mistaken, Dan?
5039000	5040000	Or did you do a John Malkovich for a while?
5040000	5041000	Could you do a John Malkovich?
5041000	5042000	No, I don't remember.
5042000	5043000	It was a shrub.
5043000	5044000	That's a tough one, yeah.
5044000	5045000	Try John Malkovich.
5045000	5047000	Cold.
5047000	5049000	Pain.
5049000	5052000	I don't understand.
5052000	5055000	Why are you asking me to do John Malkovich?
5055000	5056000	That's not bad.
5056000	5057000	You were halfway there.
5057000	5058000	Snap.
5058000	5060000	All right, so are we recaptured?
5060000	5063000	Should we try this again or should we just dive right into this motherfucker?
5063000	5066000	You should deal with music.
5066000	5067000	All right.
5068000	5069000	No, no, you do it.
5069000	5070000	You did a great job.
5070000	5071000	It just needed music.
5071000	5073000	And who's Meg Ryan playing?
5073000	5074000	She'll be playing.
5074000	5075000	Oh, God.
5075000	5078000	And when Harry met Sally, she plays just every woman.
5081000	5083000	Everyone will have what I'm having.
5083000	5084000	Everyone will have what I'm having.
5084000	5085000	She gets to the deli.
5085000	5088000	As comptroller, I'm going to outrank you, Spencer, because I love when you do it,
5088000	5090000	and I want to hear you do it for us if you don't mind.
5090000	5091000	All right.
5091000	5092000	Here we go.
5092000	5093000	So what happens?
5093000	5094000	Wrong song.
5096000	5097000	Here we go.
5098000	5100000	Shadow run.
5100000	5103000	I'm going to recap.
5103000	5109000	Starting in the warehouse district, our heroes infiltrated and stuff.
5109000	5115000	They stunned two guards indoors and then conspired to take out the three guards.
5115000	5122000	But then a tear gas grenade went in the window and threw their plans awry.
5122000	5127000	After killing the guards and setting off an alarm, they charged indoors,
5127000	5132000	where their target, Baldwin Brown, was no longer able to be found.
5132000	5140000	But the rest of the gang or enemies were knocked out by a spirit that had a wife who made soup.
5142000	5146000	After stunning the guards, our heroes were left with a conundrum.
5146000	5147000	Where was Baldwin Brown?
5147000	5149000	What would they do?
5150000	5151000	There they are.
5152000	5153000	Thank you, Spencer.
5153000	5154000	All right.
5156000	5158000	Are we all in that room with those machines?
5158000	5161000	Yeah, you're all in this machine room.
5161000	5162000	Yeah.
5162000	5163000	You're in the warehouse.
5163000	5164000	There's a bunch of junkies.
5164000	5165000	They're starting to get up.
5165000	5166000	I mean, there's not a bunch.
5166000	5167000	There's three junkies.
5167000	5168000	They're shambling around.
5168000	5172000	They're looking around the open crates in the warehouse.
5172000	5177000	Was I able to successfully convince them that everything was fine?
5177000	5178000	Are they trusting us?
5178000	5180000	They're not really paying too much attention.
5180000	5184000	They're probably going to go right into those crates and get better than life chips.
5184000	5186000	Yeah, because they're all druggy.
5186000	5189000	But they don't seem to pose much threat to us right now.
5189000	5193000	I don't know how much is in my head when I'm that drunk, but I wanted to stun baton them
5193000	5199000	and just secure the scene here, like these guys who are wandering.
5199000	5200000	All right.
5200000	5202000	I just want to stun each of them.
5202000	5205000	What's your clubs plus agility?
5205000	5207000	Bluff called?
5210000	5212000	Clubs plus agility.
5212000	5214000	I mean, mostly I like dubstep.
5217000	5218000	Wow.
5220000	5221000	I don't know what that phrase means.
5221000	5222000	I just.
5222000	5223000	Three.
5223000	5224000	It's just clubs.
5224000	5226000	Clubs agility says three.
5226000	5227000	Okay.
5227000	5228000	So what's agility?
5228000	5229000	And my agility is five.
5229000	5230000	Awesome.
5231000	5232000	You.
5234000	5235000	Yep.
5236000	5237000	You stun.
5237000	5243000	You stun one of the guys and then the others, they kind of freak out, start running around
5243000	5244000	in circles.
5244000	5246000	Sit down or it's going to get worse than life.
5246000	5247000	I go up to them.
5248000	5249000	Hey.
5249000	5250000	Hey.
5250000	5251000	Nightblade.
5251000	5252000	Take it easy.
5252000	5253000	I got this.
5253000	5254000	I go up to them with my shock gloves because my little fingerless punk rock gloves are
5254000	5256000	actually electrified shock gloves.
5256000	5258000	And I goes, who we got?
5259000	5260000	I grab each.
5260000	5262000	Are they close enough together to do both?
5262000	5263000	No.
5263000	5264000	Okay.
5264000	5266000	Then I go up and I give it to one of them right in the ass.
5266000	5267000	All right.
5267000	5270000	What's your what's your clubs plus agility?
5270000	5271000	I have four.
5271000	5273000	It's eight plus four.
5273000	5274000	All right.
5274000	5275000	That's a lot.
5275000	5276000	I know.
5276000	5277000	All right.
5277000	5279000	You also stunned the person.
5279000	5280000	All right.
5280000	5281000	He goes down.
5284000	5285000	I'm just kidding.
5286000	5287000	No, it is 12.
5287000	5288000	I know.
5288000	5289000	I know.
5289000	5290000	But delay was a joke.
5290000	5291000	I'm sorry.
5291000	5293000	Is this other guy like chasing by this?
5293000	5294000	Is he want to play ball?
5294000	5295000	Is he still running around?
5295000	5297000	Oh, he's freaking out even more.
5297000	5299000	He's he's at the door now.
5299000	5300000	Nightblade.
5300000	5301000	Take this guy down.
5301000	5302000	All right.
5302000	5303000	I take him down.
5304000	5305000	What does that mean?
5305000	5306000	What do you do?
5306000	5307000	You handle him.
5308000	5309000	Hoard to guard.
5309000	5310000	Who am I?
5310000	5311000	Are you sure?
5311000	5312000	Yeah.
5312000	5314000	I figured it'll go faster since.
5315000	5317000	Because I have don't have a problem with killing people.
5317000	5318000	Is that what it's about?
5318000	5319000	No, because it's your turn.
5319000	5321000	I assume that way.
5321000	5322000	Under your special skills.
5322000	5323000	I got worried.
5323000	5325000	Do you have Norwegian accent?
5325000	5327000	I'm worried about Baldwin.
5327000	5328000	Oh, go ahead.
5328000	5329000	Yeah.
5329000	5330000	We're wasting time at Baldwin's escaping right now.
5330000	5333000	Do not have the Norwegian, but I have the German.
5333000	5334000	If you like the German.
5334000	5335000	Close enough.
5335000	5336000	I have the German.
5336000	5337000	Yeah.
5338000	5342000	I have nothing interesting of any kind.
5342000	5343000	You don't have to do that.
5343000	5344000	It sounds great.
5344000	5346000	I just know I feel bad about pimping you out.
5346000	5348000	See, now you put me on the spot.
5348000	5349000	Now I have to do it.
5349000	5350000	Oh, OK.
5350000	5351000	You did this to yourself.
5351000	5352000	It's your fault.
5352000	5353000	Yes.
5354000	5355000	There actually is going to be a fight.
5355000	5356000	I love it.
5360000	5361000	I've never been in a fight.
5361000	5362000	OK.
5363000	5365000	We're not in combat right now.
5365000	5366000	Anybody can go, right?
5366000	5367000	Yeah.
5367000	5369000	No, they're just it's just all whatever.
5371000	5374000	Do you know that Michael Keaton's original real name is Michael Douglas?
5374000	5375000	And he had to change it.
5380000	5383000	Meg Ryan's real name is Margaret Hira.
5383000	5384000	Oh.
5384000	5385000	You're welcome.
5385000	5387000	I talked about it for a stage name once.
5387000	5389000	You love Meg Ryan.
5392000	5393000	You love her.
5394000	5395000	Of course, she's America's sweetheart.
5395000	5396000	No, a professor told me once.
5396000	5399000	She told me I needed to remember that because it would be funny once.
5400000	5404000	While this is happening, I walk up in shock and love the other guy that's running around.
5404000	5405000	Thank you.
5405000	5406000	All right.
5409000	5413000	He dodges out of the way and runs out the door.
5414000	5415000	He's gone.
5415000	5416000	You've got a junkie on the loose.
5416000	5417000	Horny guy.
5417000	5419000	Don't you don't you have like mental powers?
5419000	5422000	Can you we're looking for this Baldwin Billy Jack guy.
5422000	5425000	Like we this mission is a wash if we don't find this guy.
5425000	5426000	I don't think that's his name.
5426000	5429000	But however, can I sense the room to see if he's in the area?
5429000	5435000	You you sense you sense a living a living person in the room.
5435000	5437000	But you don't know where just in the general vicinity.
5437000	5441000	Oh, he's hiding in that wall seam thing right there.
5441000	5442000	He's in the wall scene.
5442000	5443000	We think it's a door.
5443000	5444000	Yes.
5444000	5445000	Yes.
5445000	5446000	All right.
5446000	5447000	I think we go to the door to open it.
5447000	5450000	Does anyone want to have a gun on this person?
5450000	5452000	I think we should all have a gun and be ready.
5452000	5453000	We all should.
5453000	5454000	Yeah.
5454000	5456000	Can I can I sense who's on the other side of the door?
5456000	5457000	You can't sense who it is.
5457000	5458000	All right.
5458000	5460000	Let me go grab the junkie just in case.
5460000	5461000	Okay.
5461000	5462000	Yeah.
5462000	5463000	I was going to go far.
5463000	5466000	Do you want to use my OCD is like this is junkie just running.
5466000	5468000	Like I'm I'm going nuts.
5468000	5469000	So it's a bad dream.
5469000	5471000	So stay by the seam and do what you will.
5471000	5473000	I'm going to grab the junkie.
5473000	5474000	Yeah.
5474000	5475000	I think it's working.
5475000	5476000	I'm going to.
5476000	5477000	Thank you.
5477000	5479000	I don't know if that was sarcasm, but I will.
5479000	5481000	I'm going to run after pursue the junkie.
5481000	5482000	All right.
5482000	5483000	You run out the door.
5483000	5486000	Is anyone doing anything simultaneously or are you just going to wait for that to finish?
5486000	5490000	I think we should all be ready to open that door and be ready for Baldwin in case he's
5490000	5491000	got surprises for us.
5491000	5492000	Yes.
5492000	5498000	And I'm currently wearing security guard clothes and I am very charming.
5498000	5501000	And you guys have my permission while I'm running.
5501000	5506000	I'm sim linking to say you guys can go on with the shadow run without me.
5506000	5509000	I just this is my own thing with the junkie.
5509000	5514000	It's just like I feel I'm the guy that had to collect all of the secret packages in GTA
5514000	5517000	before I finished the a story.
5517000	5519000	I'm going to unlock everything.
5519000	5522000	I said the quicker you get that junkie and get back here the better night blade.
5522000	5523000	I agree.
5523000	5526000	But just don't I don't want to my one of my biggest nightmares is you'll get to know me
5526000	5527000	better.
5527000	5529000	But like feeling like I'm the reason why.
5529000	5530000	All right.
5530000	5532000	We don't have time to pacify your night blade.
5532000	5533000	We go.
5533000	5534000	We get it.
5534000	5535000	But tick tock.
5535000	5536000	I'm still I'm multitasking.
5536000	5540000	I'm saying this while I'm chasing the junkie.
5540000	5541000	Thank you.
5541000	5549000	That's my ghost of my dad is in a Tom Cruise like hologram ship in my brain.
5549000	5554000	So the rest of you guys are opening this door.
5554000	5556000	You're swinging open the secret door.
5556000	5559000	You were faced with two silver looking barrels and nothing else.
5559000	5562000	It looks almost the size of a closet.
5562000	5568000	You hear a metallic whir as the barrels rise up into the air and underneath them a hostile
5568000	5571000	looking gun slash camera armature.
5571000	5573000	Some sort of century gun device.
5573000	5578000	It starts whirring as if it's about to shoot some fires.
5578000	5579000	I dive out of the way.
5579000	5582000	What's your reaction plus what do you call it?
5582000	5583000	Intuition.
5583000	5588000	Three plus seven total.
5588000	5589000	Seven total.
5589000	5592000	But also I have like cat like and all that shit too.
5592000	5594000	Is that sneaking or no?
5594000	5595000	No it's not.
5595000	5596000	What do you what's your armor?
5596000	5598000	Armor is 12.
5598000	5599000	All right.
5599000	5601000	Sorry everybody.
5601000	5605000	You get hit in the armor but it bounces off because it's armor.
5605000	5606000	Yeah.
5606000	5611000	The rest of you guys know you're right to applaud that.
5611000	5615000	The rest of you guys are just facing the century gun that's firing at Eve.
5615000	5616000	Okay.
5616000	5619000	I all right.
5619000	5624000	I know I know that well so it's a can't use there's there's a camera.
5624000	5625000	Yeah.
5625000	5626000	Yeah stroke.
5626000	5627000	Okay.
5627000	5639000	I'm going to use my charisma and I'm going to look into the camera because I can't move
5639000	5640000	very fast anyway.
5640000	5641000	All right.
5641000	5643000	I look into the camera.
5643000	5644000	Hi.
5644000	5648000	There's a deal we can make here.
5648000	5654000	We are we're not lame.
5654000	5657000	You're saying this while there's bullets flying around in the room.
5657000	5658000	Yeah.
5658000	5661000	Yeah I do have I'm still wearing I still have that thing on right underneath my clothes.
5661000	5664000	I have like armor on I have like a bulletproof vest kind of.
5664000	5665000	Okay.
5665000	5666000	It's true.
5666000	5669000	Wait are you you're not standing in front of the bullets.
5670000	5671000	Yeah.
5671000	5675000	If there's any response you're not paying attention to one you think it might just be
5675000	5680000	one of those like drone mounted guns like not like controlled by anyone.
5680000	5681000	Cool.
5681000	5682000	Can I hide.
5682000	5683000	Yeah.
5683000	5688000	I mean it's only kind of firing in one direction so you aren't really in any real danger anymore.
5688000	5689000	Okay.
5689000	5690000	All right.
5690000	5693000	Well I'm just going to just going to stand there and think about groceries have to buy
5693000	5694000	later.
5694000	5698000	The bullets run out of the machine so it's done firing now.
5698000	5699000	Phew.
5699000	5700000	Hello.
5700000	5705000	We're here to talk if you're done showing off your trophy dick.
5705000	5709000	It's just a small empty closet sized room.
5709000	5712000	And those two cylinders took off and left it left the room.
5712000	5716000	They kind of it rose up and they were like hiding them if that makes sense.
5716000	5719000	You know it was on top of the guns as they rose out of the ground.
5719000	5720000	Okay.
5720000	5721000	Yeah.
5721000	5724000	The old gun turrets disguised as we'll be right with you.

5747000	5750000	Running running athletics are.
5750000	5751000	I think it's running.
5751000	5753000	I mean what do you even look at.
5753000	5755000	You might not have running.
5755000	5756000	So it's a skill.
5756000	5757000	It would be a skill.
5757000	5758000	Okay.
5758000	5759000	I have running.
5759000	5761000	It's three plus two.
5761000	5762000	Awesome.
5762000	5764000	I'll tell you what that is later.
5764000	5769000	You'd quickly chase him down and you grab him by whatever you want to grab him by.
5769000	5770000	Where do you want to grab him.
5770000	5771000	His junkie scruff.

5791000	5794000	Hey listen just let me let me have a conversation with you.
5794000	5795000	He's struggling.
5798000	5799000	He's treading water.
5799000	5805000	How'd you how'd you find out this was the place to get you your chips on.
5805000	5809000	My man Brown man he hooks it up for all the junkies.
5809000	5810000	He really cares.

5833000	5834000	What do you don't kill me.
5834000	5836000	Why are you acting like you know Baldwin.
5836000	5837000	You don't know him.
5838000	5840000	I didn't act like that.
5840000	5841000	Also I do know him.
5841000	5842000	No you don't.
5842000	5843000	I'm going to kill you for not knowing him.
5843000	5845000	You can't prove you know him.
5846000	5849000	You're not proving you know him enough for me to not kill you.
5849000	5851000	You got to prove you know him.
5851000	5853000	Baldwin on the comm link.
5853000	5854000	What's going on out there.
5854000	5855000	It sounds like things are going bad.
5855000	5857000	Hey just get some information.
5863000	5866000	We have a cyber Goldberg out here.
5868000	5872000	I love that you're Jim night blade sounds like Bruce Willis as portrayed by Justin Roiland.
5878000	5880000	If you know him so good where is he.
5880000	5883000	He must have took off when that siren happened.
5883000	5885000	The alarm I mean the security one.
5885000	5886000	Where does he go.
5886000	5887000	Nip chips.
5887000	5888000	Where's he go.
5889000	5890000	Nip chips.
5893000	5894000	I don't know.
5894000	5896000	It's like the worst thing you can call somebody.
5898000	5899000	I don't know man.
5899000	5900000	I don't know.
5901000	5902000	Honestly.
5907000	5909000	Why don't you say it again.
5909000	5911000	Into the microphone.
5911000	5913000	And then I punch him in the face.
5913000	5914000	But knock him out.
5914000	5916000	Well what's your unarmed plus.
5916000	5917000	Come on.
5917000	5918000	He's a junkie.
5918000	5919000	It's a.
5919000	5922000	Well you're you know you might not be a brawler by trade.
5922000	5923000	Well I stun baton.
5923000	5924000	OK.
5924000	5925000	Well that.
5925000	5926000	Let's just say that one works.
5926000	5928000	You're touching him and it's a taser.
5928000	5929000	It works.
5930000	5932000	He goes down to the floor.
5932000	5933000	OK.
5933000	5936000	I run back to my comrades to the sound of bullets.
5936000	5937000	What the hell.
5937000	5940000	Is this a private party or am I invited.
5943000	5946000	I just dodged a close one here and I played but it looks like the bullets have run out.
5947000	5949000	I leave you guys alone for five minutes.
5949000	5950000	Yeah.
5950000	5951000	We didn't ask you to.
5951000	5953000	We're pretty happy with that guy leaving.
5953000	5955000	We heard what you did over there.
5955000	5956000	I'm a completist.
5957000	5963000	I examine the room for other like ways to get out of the doors behind behind the barrels.
5963000	5965000	You see another secret door.
5965000	5966000	Damn it.
5966000	5968000	I examine the barrels.
5968000	5973000	They look to be far too clean to actually store anything and there's no labels.
5973000	5975000	They look like decoy barrels.
5975000	5979000	I'd like to send to see if there's something beyond the barrels that we are not missing.
5979000	5981000	You just sense that door.
5981000	5983000	Other than that you're not sensing nothing.
5983000	5984000	Damn it.
5984000	5987000	Well it looks like he's not here.
5990000	5991000	Right.
5991000	5993000	I guess we should just go home and call it a day.
5993000	5996000	I guess some shadow runs don't go the way you want them.
5999000	6001000	Clomp clomp clomp clomp.
6004000	6005000	And then we all.
6005000	6011000	Can I examine the barrels to see if I can open them or see what's beneath them?
6011000	6012000	The barrels were just hiding the gun I think.
6012000	6016000	I think those were just like decoy barrels to hide the weapon that almost killed me.
6016000	6017000	Yeah that's what's under them.
6017000	6020000	There's nothing in them actually you can feel by touching them.
6020000	6023000	They're actually completely hollow and they're probably not holding anything.
6023000	6027000	I listen at the door and see if I can hear anything on the other side.
6027000	6028000	You hear nothing.
6028000	6029000	Is there a handle?
6029000	6030000	A door knob?
6030000	6032000	Nope neither.
6032000	6033000	Nightblade.
6034000	6037000	Use your strength and knock this fucker down.
6037000	6038000	All right.
6040000	6042000	Chim chimney.
6050000	6054000	I use my I kicked I kicked the secret door.
6054000	6055000	That's the door.
6055000	6056000	Right.
6056000	6057000	Yeah.
6057000	6058000	That's I got to seem like I'm not going to kick it.
6058000	6059000	It's probably it's the future.
6059000	6061000	It's not made of wood.
6061000	6065000	I'll hurt my foot which is probably also metal.
6066000	6069000	What would a nano whip do in a situation like this?
6069000	6072000	What if I were to open a can of nano whip?
6073000	6075000	Nice delicious nano whip topping.
6075000	6078000	I stand back in case things go wrong.
6079000	6080000	All right.
6080000	6081000	They do not.
6081000	6087000	You slice open the door revealing daylight outside well evening light outside.
6087000	6090000	It's the it's just the compound that leads to the out of doors.
6090000	6093000	There's a fence with all sorts of holes and stuff.
6093000	6096000	It looks like he must have booked it out of there.
6099000	6100000	No you're not.
6100000	6103000	Big ball figure out big ball with brown fat.
6103000	6104000	He's rooting for the bad guy.
6104000	6112000	I look I look out outside the hole onto the street to see if there's like any I don't know sign crumbs footprints.
6113000	6119000	There are footprints leading to a specific hole in the fence but they go right to a sidewalk street outside the fence.
6120000	6125000	So it's like he's going to a sidewalk and then I'll trace his vanish can hoard a guard.
6125000	6129000	Can you like look around and see if he's sensed anywhere.
6129000	6130000	You're reading my mind.
6130000	6131000	I thought it was my gig.
6132000	6133000	Nice.
6133000	6137000	Yes I was going to ask if I couldn't sense where he went from this hole in cell fence.
6137000	6138000	I don't think so.
6138000	6141000	I don't think you have any senses like that.
6141000	6147000	I'm going to go to the to the man that was knocked out by nightblade.
6148000	6151000	Which one I guess right.
6151000	6156000	The one that was out in the one that looks the least unconscious.
6156000	6157000	OK.
6157000	6159000	You find one that's semi-conscious.
6159000	6160000	OK.
6161000	6165000	Using my charisma and persuasion.
6166000	6168000	I lift up his face.
6168000	6169000	Hey honey.
6169000	6170000	Hey.
6170000	6171000	Hey.
6171000	6172000	Hey.
6172000	6173000	Are you OK.
6173000	6174000	I got shocked.
6174000	6175000	Oh.
6176000	6177000	I know that's hard.
6177000	6179000	That's hard when that happens.
6180000	6182000	I'm here to help you.
6182000	6183000	I'm an angel.
6183000	6184000	Oh good.
6184000	6185000	Yeah.
6186000	6191000	Hey we're that we're trying to find your friend Baldwin.
6191000	6194000	It's really important that you tell us where he is.
6194000	6195000	Can you tell me.
6195000	6199000	Can you tell me anything about where he stays or any hideout sweetie.
6199000	6200000	Just here.
6200000	6201000	He was just here.
6201000	6202000	Yeah.
6202000	6205000	Does he have any restaurants he likes or.
6205000	6207000	Do you know where he lives or.
6207000	6208000	I barely know.
6208000	6210000	I just buy drugs off the guy.
6210000	6211000	Oh honey.
6211000	6215000	I smack him in the face and move to the next one.
6216000	6222000	I summon an eagle to fly through the sky to see if we can see any sign of Baldwin on escape.
6222000	6223000	All right.
6223000	6226000	What's your conjuring plus magic there.
6226000	6230000	First I activate my spirit focus for spirits of air which gives me an extra thing.
6230000	6237000	And then my conjuring is it's summoning is five plus what magic.
6237000	6238000	So 11 plus two.
6238000	6240000	That's 13.
6240000	6241000	Yep.
6241000	6242000	You summon.
6242000	6245000	Wait what force spirit to summon an eagle.
6245000	6248000	No what force pick a no force for.
6248000	6249000	All right.
6249000	6250000	All right.
6250000	6254000	You take four drain damage as it comes into the ether.
6254000	6259000	It's an exerting work pulling multiple spirits to the metaphysical the regular physical.
6259000	6261000	I thought my other spirit went away.
6261000	6262000	It sure did Dan.
6262000	6263000	Not Dan.
6263000	6264000	Jeff.
6264000	6265000	Sure did.
6265000	6266000	Jeff.
6266000	6268000	You don't even know the difference between us.
6268000	6269000	I don't know.
6269000	6271000	Why is that very serious.
6271000	6274000	I just I just took I took a lot of drain on that eagle.
6274000	6275000	Yeah.
6275000	6276000	All right.
6276000	6278000	I look at the eagle and I'm a little wizzy and I say eagle fly.
6278000	6279000	Look.
6279000	6280000	Look for Baldwin Brown.
6280000	6282000	He's a balding guy who looks like this and that and whatever.
6282000	6284000	Take it to the sky and see if you can find him Eagle.
6284000	6286000	I will leave.
6286000	6289000	Can we have the voice of the eagle be the drunk guy over there.
6289000	6292000	It's just like can you just be like my voice that I did.
6292000	6294000	What is that.
6294000	6295000	I want to do my voice.
6295000	6296000	Sorry.
6296000	6297000	Yeah.
6297000	6298000	Do your voice.
6298000	6299000	You sir.
6299000	6300000	Yeah.
6300000	6301000	Eagle voices.
6301000	6302000	I'm sorry.
6302000	6304000	My other spirit of fart the other day.
6304000	6305000	You made it a fart.
6305000	6308000	No I didn't make it if I was a witness spirit of wind.
6308000	6309000	Oh sorry.
6309000	6315000	Well while this stuff is happening also I'm going to I'm for my part I'm going to go see
6315000	6318000	if I can gather from the crates where those junkies were headed.
6318000	6319000	I was going to do it.
6319000	6325000	I'm going to try to pick up the secondary goal which is gather as many of these BTL
6325000	6326000	chips.
6326000	6327000	All right.
6327000	6329000	There's there's way too many chips.
6329000	6333000	Also the spirit takes off quickly to follow your instructions.
6333000	6335000	I think there's a isn't there a truck in there.
6335000	6339000	There's two semi trucks and there's just multiple dozens of crates.
6339000	6341000	We might be able to load up these trucks and take them out that way.
6341000	6342000	Yeah.
6342000	6344000	That's what I was thinking.
6344000	6345000	Okay.
6345000	6350000	So while the spirit is out scouting around let's load this let's find as many crates
6350000	6352000	of the BTLs load these trucks up.
6352000	6353000	I'll do it.
6353000	6354000	You do that.
6354000	6356000	You load a twelve.
6356000	6357000	No.
6357000	6361000	Twenty five BTL boxes onto the semi truck.
6361000	6362000	All right.
6362000	6363000	Okay.
6363000	6366000	I'm at the I'm at the next guy.

6370000	6371000	I rouse them.
6371000	6373000	I'm going to try something different.
6373000	6374000	All right.
6374000	6376000	What's your con plus charisma.
6376000	6378000	My con is nine.
6378000	6384000	Well it says six and then in parentheses nine and my Christmas seven.
6384000	6385000	All right.

6428000	6432000	His tails are metal.
6432000	6438000	We've tied him up and he's almost dead motherfucker.
6438000	6440000	Just like you get your fucking life together.
6440000	6442000	Now where's Baldwin and I'll save your dad.
6442000	6443000	I don't know.
6443000	6446000	I got knocked out early.
6446000	6447000	I slap him.
6447000	6449000	Tell me anything.
6449000	6452000	I wet my bed.

6481000	6482000	Thank you.
6482000	6484000	But I'm gonna watch you and I take out one of my tracking
6484000	6491000	tags and I open his jaw and I stuff it in his mouth
6491000	6495000	and I close his mouth and I say my name is Mercy O'Donnell
6495000	6498000	motherfucker.
6498000	6501000	I got eyes like diamonds but they sharp.
6508000	6509000	Hello.

6513000	6515000	All right.
6515000	6516000	I guess she.
6521000	6524000	I didn't know it was that easy.
6524000	6528000	I didn't know you could do that.
6528000	6531000	So the beauty of the imagination down.
6531000	6532000	No.
6532000	6533000	You.
6533000	6534000	Okay.
6534000	6537000	I mean does she die when that happens like is it like it's
6537000	6538000	like a Bruce Willis surrogate.
6538000	6539000	It just goes.
6540000	6543000	I'm embarrassed but I do want to come back.
6550000	6551000	Sorry.
6551000	6552000	All right.
6552000	6554000	We're all going through stuff.
6554000	6555000	We're all grieving.
6555000	6557000	We all grieve in different ways.
6557000	6558000	So all that work you got.
6558000	6560000	You got a picture of a guy that we already know what he looks
6560000	6561000	like.
6561000	6564000	Well you didn't know exactly what.
6564000	6565000	Didn't we see him on a screen.
6565000	6566000	We saw him on a screen.
6566000	6567000	I don't know.
6567000	6568000	Maybe.
6568000	6569000	Yeah.
6569000	6570000	Well back.
6570000	6571000	Our contact.
6571000	6572000	Mr. Johnson showed him.
6572000	6573000	Well I look at the picture.
6573000	6575000	Is he doing anything in the picture like standing in front
6575000	6578000	of his mailbox or the address or anything.
6578000	6580000	You know the pictures that we all carry with us.
6580000	6581000	Give to people.
6581000	6586000	No he's just it's like it's it's the interior of a bathroom.
6586000	6587000	Oh okay.
6587000	6591000	Can I use perception to know where that bathroom is.
6591000	6593000	And what is he doing in the bathroom.
6593000	6597000	He's just taking a picture in the mirror selfie stuff.
6598000	6599000	What.
6599000	6600000	What's your perception.
6600000	6601000	Plus.
6601000	6602000	I'm so sorry.
6602000	6605000	I took my folder and I left it in the green room.
6605000	6608000	Well you can't find out where his bathroom is located then.
6608000	6609000	Okay.
6609000	6610000	That's fair.
6610000	6611000	No it's fair.
6611000	6612000	That's fair.
6612000	6613000	I don't think you could any way to be fair.
6613000	6614000	Yeah.
6614000	6615000	I mean even if you saw really well.
6615000	6616000	Okay.
6616000	6619000	It was worth how empowered I felt for that 30 seconds.
6619000	6621000	This this embarrassment right now.
6621000	6624000	So the semi trucks all loaded up.
6624000	6625000	The spirit hasn't come back.
6625000	6628000	It's only been about five minutes.
6628000	6630000	Anybody got a class C license.
6630000	6634000	I never learned how to drive.
6634000	6637000	I live in the woods for so long.
6637000	6639000	It's class C trucks.
6639000	6640000	No that's normal stuff.
6640000	6641000	Normal isn't it.
6641000	6642000	Yeah.
6642000	6645000	So class A is that a snowmobile or is it.
6645000	6650000	I think class B is small trucks and then class A is like all the cool trucks and the hover
6650000	6651000	cars.
6651000	6654000	Does hardware help with that or software.
6654000	6657000	No it would just be driving.
6657000	6660000	Oh I ain't got that.
6660000	6662000	I think Hordegard knows how to drive.
6662000	6663000	Hordegard.
6663000	6664000	Driving.
6664000	6665000	No.
6665000	6666000	Hold on.
6666000	6667000	Hush.
6667000	6672000	I don't know if I like this guy or if I don't like this guy.
6672000	6674000	I don't think I do.
6674000	6676000	Don't think I like him.
