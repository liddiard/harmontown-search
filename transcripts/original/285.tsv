200460	205340	It vibrates every 45 seconds to cue you
205340	207860	to a different part of your butt.
207860	211660	Oh, I'm a rapper.
211660	214260	Me, me, doo, me, doo, me, doo, me, doo, me, doo, me, doo,

218460	221260	Oh, you be deeper.
221260	223740	Oh, I'm a rapper.
223740	226540	Oh, I think I almost forgot about the faint.
227860	228360	All right.
228360	228860	Thank you.
228860	229860	Welcome to the show.
229860	230360	Yeah.
230360	232860	Yay.
232860	235060	Hardest line in hip-hop ever.
235060	237060	I have a niece I haven't met.
240060	242160	Such tragedy.
242160	244760	The pain in that line.
244760	245860	We all felt it.
249260	254260	That was pretty hard.
254460	256660	That was sad as fuck.
256660	259060	I have a niece I haven't met.
259060	260060	Jesus Christ.
264660	270460	Well, we've got a horrible, horrible show for you tonight.
270460	271260	Not in the mood.
275260	278500	I had a great time in New York, but a self-destructive one.
278500	281160	I mean, I really alarmed myself and Cody.
281160	283260	What were you doing in New York?
283660	285660	I was just drinking.
285660	287660	No, I was also, I was premiering,
287660	294660	I was attending the premiere of a movie I was in.
294660	299460	The title of which is very long and starts at the word seven stages.
299460	304860	I think if you Google seven stages, Harmon or Holy Storch,
304860	307760	which is played by Taika Waititi.
307760	308960	Kate McCoochie's in it.
308960	309660	Excellent.
309660	310560	Sam Huntington.
310560	311360	They're amazing.
311360	313560	I mean, McCoochie, I don't want to, I don't want to play favorites,
313560	315960	whatever, but it's like she, she exactly produced the movie.
315960	319660	And she's, she's just, she's so fantastic at it.
319660	320460	Very genius.
320460	321160	Yeah.
321160	322160	Very genius.
322160	327560	There's a lot of, there's a lot of really cool alternative.
328560	333860	I don't know what you, there's, there's, there's very hip funny people in it
333860	335960	that have much smaller roles than me.
335960	340660	And I'm incredibly fat and it made me feel great because I felt like I lost weight
340660	341360	when I watched it.
341360	343660	I was like, wow, look how fat you are on the screen.
344460	347560	The camera adds a lot of self-hate.
347960	348360	Yeah.
350760	354860	I mean, I saw, I saw, I was, I was, I was at the, I was in the bathroom
354860	359860	in my New York hotel room and I was, I was, it was a night of drinking
359860	365160	and I had a good time and, and then I'm like, it's brushing my teeth.
366260	369060	And I think, I think, I believe that this is what I did.
369060	374460	I, I, I had to tell the staff, I'm sorry, I broke a light bulb, like a, like
374460	379260	the glass ball that covers the bulb and, but I didn't tell them.
379860	383160	I did it on purpose because that would be insane.
383360	384560	But I think that's what I did.
384560	389360	I was like, I was like looking at it and then I just reached out and pulled
389360	394560	it off and dropped it on the floor of the bathroom.
394660	395160	Okay.
395260	397060	That's fucking badass, man.
398160	399760	That's metal as fuck.
400660	402760	I mean, that's how, you know, your life is going pretty well.
402860	405360	You're just like making up disasters.
405960	407460	Did it satisfy you?
407460	411060	No, I, well, I just, I just kind of looked at it and was like, huh,
411360	412560	what was that?
412860	413960	What was that behavior?
414260	414960	It was weird.
415260	417160	I told the lady at the front desk, I'm really sorry.
417160	419360	I, you know, of course, obviously I'm going to pay for it, but I don't
419360	420760	want the staff to get hurt.
420960	423960	There's broken glass on the floor and she's like, yeah, you seem like you're
423960	428760	in pretty high spirits and I was like, yeah, I'm quite drunk.
428960	429860	So she deserved it.
430260	430660	She did.
430660	431860	Well, I don't know.
431860	432460	She was nice.
432460	433060	She was very nice.
433060	433360	I like that.
433360	435960	You knew that these people were going to be jerks at this hotel.
435960	438460	If something should go wrong, I just outed.
438460	441860	I got like, I'm going to prove it's like when an adopted kid like sets
441860	444960	fire to their foster parents living room and then they're like you
444960	445460	piece of shit.
445460	450660	He's like, see, were you in high spirits?
451560	452960	I was drunk, right?
453560	453860	Yeah.
453860	454660	I had a great time.
454660	457160	You know, who's a great guy that I would really love to hang out with here
457160	460160	in LA and I'm sure I'll come on the show and Mark McKinney.
460160	464660	I had never, I think that was the last kid in the hall that I, that I've met.
464960	465260	Yeah.
465560	466660	Canadians are good people.
466760	467160	They're nice.
467160	469560	There's no, there's no bra bra bada.
469760	470160	Yeah.
470460	474360	He's a very, I was, I, I, I, I, I, I risk insulting him by sounding
474360	479960	shocked by this, but he's just a very funny guys, very witty, charming
479960	483660	and friendly and, uh, he likes to, he likes to drink.
483860	485660	He's, he's, he's, he's Canadian.
485760	486360	They like to drink.
486360	489360	They're like, they're basically like Milwaukee and in Canada, you know,
491160	491960	does he live in LA?
491960	493460	Is there a chance that you guys could have a play date?
493660	493960	Yeah.
493960	498260	I think he, I think he's, he's in Toronto a lot, but he is also living here.
498260	501960	And I think that, yeah, I can't remember what his exact schedule is, but
501960	505860	we did exchange digits and, uh, I think he'd be a great guest on the show.
505960	506360	It's awesome.
507960	508460	What else?
508860	511060	Also, and then I want to know about the garage fixed.
511260	512860	Uh, it's fixed at this point.
512860	514860	It's just, it has to be painted.
515260	516760	Doesn't have an address on it yet.
517060	518460	Uh, that's not a big deal.
518460	519560	I'm not going to let that get to me.
519860	520160	Okay.
520460	522060	I don't really, I didn't really need a garage.
522060	525460	I don't have a car, but, uh, it's good that it's fixed.
525460	526060	I guess.
526260	526560	Okay.
527160	529560	Well, it was urban blight on my block.
530860	536460	Uh, what's with the, what's with the, what's with the grit in Bloody Mary's?
536460	537060	What is that?
537060	543260	Why, why, why, why is there, why is part of a Bloody Mary just gross little
543260	546560	chunky balls of black, like fucking shit?
546860	547960	It's a peppercorns.
550660	551760	Motherfucker, you ordered it.
553860	554760	You know, it's a bartender.
554760	558960	So yeah, you ordered the, the shit with the shit in it.
559060	559360	Yeah.
559360	563860	Well, I just can't, is it so, so I, can I say when I order a Bloody Mary,
563860	565960	can I say, can you not with the peppercorn?
566260	566760	Okay.
566860	570660	I'm going to try that sometimes because I kind of like every once in a while,
570660	571960	I'll be in the mood for a Bloody Mary.
571960	575660	But then I remember I'd like come shoots up through the straw, this fucking
575660	578960	like shitty little BB of charcoal.
582260	583360	God, it's it's it's it.
583360	586260	And then you take out the straw, you try to drink around it.
586260	590760	You get the fucking balls of pepper on your mustache and fucking just gross.
590760	591860	What a gross drink.
591860	595060	What a terrible, terrible thing to do to somebody.
595760	596360	Hotel Mark.
596360	597960	Was it hotel or was it out?
598160	598760	Were you out?
598860	603460	We were, I had a bloody Mary at the standard with, I wasn't staying at
603460	608260	the standard, but I went there to drink and wait for our car to come.
608360	608760	Okay.
610360	611260	Not a bad choice.
612260	613660	Baby Boomers are bad people.
613660	614660	I wrote that down.
616660	621060	They're almost dead, but the ones that are left, you know, kind of destroying.
621060	622260	Why do you feel like they're bad people?
622260	624760	Is it because of the events of of late or do you feel like they blew it
624760	626260	through the 60s and 70s?
626560	629260	I think I guess the former, I guess, you know, they're just they're just
629260	630560	not aging very well at all.
630560	635860	They're becoming villains and I mean, maybe the good ones died at like 65.
635960	637760	A lot of there's also a lot of assassination.
639160	644260	And now we're now we are left with the mummies and assassins that yeah,
644860	646860	so it's just don't take it personal.
647160	651560	If you have a Baby Boomer in your life, maybe they're a ghost or an angel.
652460	654560	But if they're alive, they're probably a piece of shit.
654560	655360	We're pretty much.
655560	657260	Or they invented street lights.
657460	658660	They invented street lights.
658660	659260	That's true.
659260	661860	They were the dude that was like, we should use glue for concrete.
662860	665560	You know, so we have never see a whole person.
665560	669560	I'm like, this motherfucker might be the person who invented those bags
669560	672460	that hang over you in surgery with the saline in them.
672960	673260	Right.
673260	677260	So I'm like, be nice, you know, be nice because they because if they invented
677260	678760	it, they might be able to recall them.
678760	679060	Right.
679860	684460	Then you'll be standing at an operating table like with a with a with a with
684460	688560	a brick hanging over you with a hose coming down in your arm.
689260	692160	How great would it be if old people could recall technology?
693760	697460	I didn't I didn't invent street lights that all these immigrants could
697460	699160	go come to my country.
699160	700460	I'm turning them off.
701060	702460	I said the music's too loud.
702460	703960	Now give us back the subwoofer.
704760	706560	Nobody gets the subwoofer.
707960	710160	You all have to use twitters.
710360	711260	Too much rap.
711760	712760	It's too much rap.
712760	713960	I want to hear the Beatles.
716060	717860	Well, it's kind of interesting Brandon.
717860	723160	You you in singing the praises of our previous generation.
723160	726860	You really went to some less likely places than people usually go.
726860	730860	I usually go to the Ed Sullivan Beatles moon thing and you you're
730860	732360	talking glue and concrete.
732360	733160	That's interesting.
734760	736060	Didn't didn't know Spencer.

741460	742260	But we're fighting.
742260	743360	What are you guys fighting about?
743660	748360	Oh, we got blue apron the other day and Spencer wouldn't let me
748360	751360	make glazed nut sauce with a reduction.
751360	752160	Bully a bays.

766560	769960	The nuts just nuts nuts.
769960	771660	What kind of sauce is what you should be asking?
771860	774460	It's a nut sauce a bully based reduction.
780560	783260	If you're just joining us, I'm in a bad mood.
783260	784060	I'm hungover.
790360	793660	We're through the TSA checkpoint as we all do when we travel.
793660	794160	Of course.
794160	796460	Yes, you have to even I didn't even have a bad.

797460	799060	I'm not I just get here.
799060	801860	I just like I don't understand why they are upset.
801860	803360	Why are they upset?
803360	806260	What in the fuck did they think was going to happen?
806660	807860	They don't make a lot of money.
808160	809460	I don't fucking care.
809460	809860	I'm sorry.
809860	810460	I'm yelling at you.

824960	828460	you can you can you can buy food.
828460	833060	Yes, but I I don't I was poor once I was a dishwasher.
833060	834260	I didn't make enough money.
834260	835860	There were too many dirty dishes.
835860	837660	I wish I wish that there were less.
837860	840460	I wish that they were cleaner when they came to me, but I was
840460	841260	a dishwasher.
841260	842760	That's how they feel about you all.
843160	844960	I exactly but I wish you were cleaner.
845060	846460	There's too many of you.
846560	847560	You're all in a bad mood.
847560	851060	You're all running late and we don't understand and they're
851060	852760	trying to save your life and you give them shit.
852760	854760	They're trying to save our life.
854760	855160	True.
855160	856560	That's that's how the TSA feels.
856560	858260	They're like we're the janitors.
859260	860560	Then they should smile.
862260	863960	If they think they're saving people's lives.
863960	867660	They should they should like Superman's what if they were
867660	868560	very happy?
868860	869260	What's up?
869260	870560	They could wear capes.
870560	873460	Yeah, we should make them we should let them wear capes.
873460	877060	No, we should make them wear capes and then make them feel
877060	882560	good about yeah, or maybe they should like I just I maybe
882560	885660	what happened yesterday is probably going to happen today.
885660	889960	I eat a bunch of people who are not always in an airport are
889960	892660	going to come to an airport for the first time in a while.
892760	896360	Some of them from foreign countries all all of them at
896360	898160	non-ideal times in their lives.
898160	900560	None of them having gotten up that morning.
902160	906660	Eager to pull their shoes off and put their belts in a
906660	907560	liquid bag.
908560	913260	No one but but but they they get they they get to be there
913760	915460	and be used to it.
915460	918460	They they get to be native to the to the place that we hate
918460	922660	to be but but I just I don't I don't understand is why are
922660	923660	they so cranky?
923860	927860	I just wish they would be mad at the right people because there
927860	930960	are people that don't get their laptops out and then there are
930960	934460	people who don't take their jackets off and then those people
934460	935860	aren't the ones they get mad at.
935960	939960	Yeah, I get always just like oh you have a phone.
940260	942960	It's like yeah, everybody has a fucking phone, but it's like
942960	943460	shut up.
943460	946460	But it's like they're always mad about stupid shit or they're
946460	950460	like mad about like I don't know someone's not hearing them
950460	953160	and it's like yeah, I mean everyone's here.
953260	953860	Here's it.
953860	954660	Here's a thought.
954660	959560	Okay, if where you work, this goes beyond the TSA, but this
959560	966360	is like if where you work, there is a sign that says what
966360	972160	everyone's supposed to do and you find yourself repeatedly
972160	973960	and exasperating Lee.
975160	980460	Pointing at the sign and saying it's on the sign what the what
980460	984860	we call that in the sign business is a non-working sign.
986360	988060	That's called a bad sign.
988060	989960	It's not working correctly.
990360	995560	So it's not really 40,000 strangers fault that they're not
995560	998860	seeing the sign or taking it into their hearts.
998960	1003760	See, it really can't be 40,000 people's fault 40,000 people
1003760	1007060	can't really do anything wrong on purpose.
1007060	1008460	They're hold on.
1008460	1009160	Let's hold on.
1009160	1013160	Yeah, let's back up for well, I've got 40,000 strangers.
1013160	1015960	Let's let's emphasize their strangers to each other strangers
1015960	1016760	in Germany.
1017260	1022360	That's people showing up for they're not strangers.
1022360	1024860	They're like in a Moose Lodge kind of organization and they're
1024860	1027560	like, let's set fire to this church or something.
1030360	1032960	They hated that church.
1033460	1034560	Well, but wait a minute.
1034560	1035360	No, no, don't worry.
1035360	1038360	I want to go back like that's not there is no exception to
1038360	1040260	what I'm saying because we're saying wrong.
1040260	1043460	I'm saying the sign is wrong because it's not working if
1043460	1047360	you're at a Nazi rally and with 40,000 Nazis and there's
1047360	1050760	a sign that says no cell phones and all the other Nazis are
1050760	1054360	on their cell phone before you go like guys, you're being
1054360	1059460	bad Nazis and point the sign move the sign make it the text
1059460	1060060	bigger.
1060060	1063860	I make change the color scheme Nazis say what stop being
1063860	1064560	Nazis.
1064760	1066260	Don't worry about your cell phones.
1066260	1067060	Just go home.
1067060	1071360	Yeah, but you're I mean, that's not I yeah, but the sure that
1071360	1072360	too, that would be great.
1072360	1073360	But yeah, watch.
1073360	1074460	We're talking about signs.
1074460	1076360	Yeah, we're talking about trying to improve science.
1076660	1082460	Spencer don't be a fucking Nazi about my metaphors.
1082460	1084960	I think you said a lot of people couldn't be wrong and I
1084960	1087260	was like, I feel like a lot of people are often wrong.
1087460	1090160	I take your point about bad design semantics.
1090560	1092760	Everyone is all wrong about everything.
1092760	1095660	We were born monsters were terrible monkey people that
1095660	1097360	fucking suck and eat dicks.
1097360	1098160	But what about that?
1098160	1101060	You know, isn't there a tendency of people to ignore signs
1101060	1106660	anyway that like like I mean, I agree like I agree that
1106660	1110260	a bad sign is like can be marked by the fact that people
1110260	1110660	don't read it.
1110660	1112760	But at the same time, there's like doors that say push
1112760	1115060	and pull and then people just don't look and stuff like
1115060	1116060	that bad sign.
1116460	1119760	Well, I mean not working not working the whole experience
1119760	1120660	is not working out.
1120660	1122660	Yeah, and the signs part of the whole experience.
1122660	1124860	Yeah, I think I think whoever put up the sign at a noble
1124860	1127260	effort, but however long the signs been up there and however
1127260	1129660	mad you are that people aren't pushing and pulling I'd
1129660	1132660	say you got a it's not it's really not logical.
1132660	1134160	It's not going to it's not going to work.
1134160	1136660	It's like the people are a force of nature there when
1136660	1139760	they're moving through a door that people don't have
1139760	1143360	incentive to read every written information around,
1143360	1145960	you know, we kind of like how they don't they don't right.
1145960	1147460	So dumb sign.
1147960	1149860	It's not working well going to work.
1149860	1151060	People don't work like that.
1151560	1153260	There's no sign that people are going to read.
1154360	1156960	Right particularly if the experience is the same experience
1156960	1159460	got or if it's telling them to do something got to figure
1159460	1162660	out a new way to make people do stuff.
1162660	1165360	You don't want them doing what if we get someone to yell
1165360	1169160	the same thing sure over and over until they want to kill
1169160	1173160	everybody sure or or add a class to their grade schools
1173160	1177160	and wait 20 years for everyone to become better better
1177160	1178560	pushers and pullers of doors.
1178560	1180460	I don't know we should get we should start that right now.
1180460	1182760	I think well we ought to if we if we if we're going to be
1182760	1185460	mad 20 years from now about people not staying off the
1185460	1186060	grass.
1186860	1191060	We should we should we should give them grass feet.
1191060	1193760	We should have some special vitamins that make their feet
1193760	1194360	grass.
1194360	1195860	These pants brought the grump out in you.
1195860	1198460	I'm a very angry man in his pajamas.
1198460	1203860	Yeah, I just I just why is everyone so dumb?
1203860	1207660	Why is everyone so stupid and mean and ugly?
1208360	1209560	That's a it's a rhetorical question.
1209560	1211060	I thought you said you have fun in New York.
1211060	1211360	I did.
1211360	1212060	I did have fun.
1212060	1213660	I tell you tell me what else did you do?
1213860	1217960	I it was mostly it was a lot of who'd you go with Dino?
1218160	1218960	Oh fuck.
1218960	1219460	Yeah.
1221860	1224160	So you got to have some stories.
1225760	1226760	I mean that you you know.
1227460	1229860	Yeah, I have to think let's bring Rob Schwab up.
1229860	1233860	Well, I like I can think about that Rob Schwab gentleman
1233860	1238860	Robert Schwab back from his tour in 48 continental states
1238860	1241360	under Schwab our the shop tour.
1242160	1244260	So for merchandise will be available after the show.
1244260	1249960	Rob Schwab coming to the stage size mama's pussy on the page
1249960	1255360	fading on mama Schwab's vagina got robbed.

1258560	1259360	in the air.
1259660	1260760	Give me your tushy.
1262060	1265260	I'm just trying to feed my family rob your pussy.
1266560	1267360	Dramamine.
1269660	1270160	Hello.
1271160	1271860	Hello, Dan.
1271860	1273960	How was your trip to New York?
1274560	1275260	It was good.
1275760	1276860	I broke a light bulb.
1277160	1280760	You know like like like like like like like I'm like like
1280760	1285660	I was a rapper like you were just like an idea apocalypse
1285660	1287560	now where he smashes the mirror.
1287660	1297060	Yeah, but I think honestly wasn't that man scavenging a
1297060	1299060	rapper. I think loot the hotel room.
1300660	1304760	It took so long to plan that I spent somebody said something
1304760	1309360	about that guy that is that it's not it's not a joking
1309360	1310860	matter, but it's a happy.
1311760	1314360	It's a happier ending to the story that guy that saved
1314360	1315560	everybody at the Waffle House.
1315560	1316860	Not every bad motherfucker.
1317560	1319660	Yeah, but it's always cool.
1319660	1322460	Somebody tweeted something funny like the guy because it's
1322460	1326960	like he he he looted the the mass shooting or he like
1327960	1330260	like like the headline was good Fox News is gonna say that
1330260	1333360	he stole he stole a gun and that is the thing.
1333360	1336060	It is kind of funny that yes, he got the gun from the dude
1336160	1337860	and then the cops showed up and shot him.
1338360	1339060	Wait, shut up.
1339060	1342060	The cops shot the fucking hero guy shot the hero guy
1342060	1344460	because they were like cuz he was holding a gun.
1344560	1347060	Oh my like they didn't know who was who they'd heard shots.
1347060	1348760	I had no idea that happened.
1348760	1350060	That was like fucking bummer.
1350060	1350560	I'm lying.
1350560	1352160	But this is where we are America.
1352460	1353160	That's straight up.
1353160	1354260	This is where we are.
1354660	1356160	That's Night of the Living Dead.
1356460	1359460	Yeah, there aren't there aren't any I mean, I don't I don't
1359460	1361660	know the police aren't supposed to necessarily know this
1361660	1364860	that the guy's holding a gun, but but just to make the
1364860	1365560	observation.
1365560	1367760	This is usually it's usually all right.
1367760	1368860	Right, right.
1368860	1373960	What what I mean, did you just start a different podcast
1373960	1380960	at the same time as I was at the same time the problem.
1380960	1384660	I mean it illustrates the problem with a gun incident,
1385060	1388560	which is that it's a highly chaotic information or a situation
1388560	1391560	in which a lot of information changes at a very fast pace
1391860	1396760	and even having a gun in a shooting situation can be a liability
1396760	1398660	that gets you killed instead of protected.
1398860	1401960	So like that's just inherent to the beast and like this is
1401960	1406760	exactly why I mean say that guy had a gun say that guy shot
1406760	1410660	the shooter say he did it before he got any casualties that
1410660	1413260	guy still might have ended up dead because you know, he was
1413260	1416260	the guy who had a gun when the cops showed up and that's
1416260	1420560	just what might go through the the potential murderer.
1420960	1424260	The hero's bullet could go through his entire body and hit
1424260	1428560	a baby especially from an assault rifle or they could just
1428560	1430660	shoot a baby instead of hitting the perpetrator and then
1430660	1433260	the perpetrator pops like six shots off that runs off or
1433260	1436660	you know, who knows I mean, yeah, also also here's the thing
1436660	1437060	about this.
1437060	1441960	Everybody needs to have a gun concept, which that's not freedom.
1441960	1444460	I don't want to have a gun in public.
1444460	1448560	I don't I bear like I immediately as soon as I could got
1448560	1451260	rid of my wallet and put all my credit cards in my phone case.
1451260	1453960	Do you think I want to I want to stop at the counter before
1453960	1457360	I go out the door and load of 45 or heavier?
1457660	1458560	It's ridiculous.
1458560	1460360	I don't even like carrying a laptop.
1460360	1461760	I don't think you want to do that.
1461760	1463360	I don't want to have a gun.
1463460	1465860	I don't think you want to have a gun outside.
1465860	1469260	You know who might or might not our classic character MC gun
1469260	1471560	control. Oh shit.
1472460	1477560	Yo, it's me MC gun control the character where the joke is
1477560	1481060	that you can't tell if he's a for or against guns.
1482160	1489260	MC gun awareness bang bang shoot shoot bang a lot of guns
1489260	1493760	out there in a gang or not in a shooter's hands.
1494260	1497860	It's a crazy second amendment land got two guns.
1497860	1503560	They're dangerous powerful weapons for all of us MC gun
1503560	1507660	control. You can't tell what side I'm on.
1508660	1510760	So now MC gun control.
1512060	1517660	Yes in the past you have at least said the words gun control
1517660	1521660	a fair amount which has led there to be like the perception
1521660	1524160	of some amount of balance where you're talking about gun
1524160	1524660	control.
1524660	1528460	Yeah, my job is to spread awareness make people aware of
1528460	1531260	gun control, but at this point you were just like talking
1531260	1533960	about a landscape of guns and things people could do with
1533960	1534460	guns.
1534460	1538460	It's the most lethal nation in the United States of the world,
1538460	1540560	but you weren't even mentioning gun control at all.
1540560	1543660	You're just kind of like you're almost just promoting guns
1543660	1546660	and the things you do almost impossible to control guns.
1546660	1547960	They're out of control.
1547960	1553360	That's the awareness guns are incredible killing machines.
1555160	1560760	Right you keep saying that I've done are you glad you're aware
1560760	1563960	you keep saying anyone who wants to kill should get a gun.
1563960	1565160	Yeah, I did.
1565160	1569060	I don't that would be a that would probably be an accidental
1569560	1572860	breaching of the comedic formula because I would that
1572860	1576360	would be like it's Pat saying that she's a woman.
1576560	1579460	Well, I mean that's implying that people who want to kill
1579460	1580560	people are good.
1581060	1581860	Oh, thank you.
1581860	1582360	Okay.
1582460	1582960	All right.
1583760	1588460	But anyways, the joke is you can't tell I mean you did say
1588460	1590160	incredible killing machine.
1590560	1591060	Yeah.
1591060	1595560	Yeah, I'm I it's it's the word incredible means hard to
1595560	1600460	believe and you did say the wounds that guns create were
1601360	1602860	like amazing.
1604560	1606060	They're remarkable, right?
1606060	1606660	Remarkable.
1606660	1607160	That's what you said.
1607160	1608160	I'm not worthy.
1608160	1609360	That's no, that's more neutral.
1609360	1609760	That's true.
1610260	1611460	Okay, funny stuff.
1611460	1611860	All right.
1611860	1612460	Moving on.
1613960	1616560	What t-shirt are you wearing Spencer?
1617260	1620560	Oh, just this Chinese murder van t-shirt.
1620560	1624360	Whoa, you guys hear about this Chinese murder vans.
1624360	1627360	Why don't you stand up and parade it around your finance?
1627360	1628260	Let me look at you.
1628260	1629260	Damn, dude.
1630460	1632560	Why don't you move that bush out of the way so I can make
1632560	1633360	your tits.
1634460	1635060	Sorry.
1637460	1638660	I guess that's the size.
1638660	1639560	We got our title.
1640460	1642560	Why don't you move that bush out of the way?
1642560	1646060	So we can look at your tips trying to I've just spitball
1646060	1647960	and t-shirt ideas at this point.
1648660	1649860	I'm really sorry.
1649860	1652860	You're just a walking t-shirt idea factory.
1653160	1654860	What what is that t-shirt?
1655060	1657260	That's just someone could explain it Spencer.
1657260	1659660	You guys hear about these Chinese murder vans.
1660360	1661860	Speaking of show going to take mine.
1661860	1664860	Well now you don't have to it's not that you can own the
1664860	1666460	Chinese murder van t-shirt.
1666760	1667260	I'm fat.
1667260	1668360	No, it's kind of hot up here.
1669760	1671760	It's hot when you're trying to get one of these Chinese
1671760	1672960	murder van t-shirts.
1672960	1675660	Oh, that's simple and I want it to be organic.
1675960	1676460	Yes.
1676760	1680360	Do you want to be it to be made by tea public?
1680560	1684160	I meant more of the segue, but sure the materials should be
1684160	1685360	organic as well.
1685560	1685860	Yes.
1685860	1691160	Are you segueing to and add me on these Chinese t-shirts?
1691460	1694560	What if the what if blue apron made it blue aprons out of
1694560	1697760	micromodal three times softer than cotton?
1697960	1698960	Now that could be big.
1698960	1701960	What if the what if the aprons vibrated every 40 seconds?
1701960	1705860	What if Airbnb offered free me undies for guests?
1705860	1708560	Did apron come with you to New York?
1708660	1709160	Apron?
1709160	1709660	No.
1709960	1711760	You are most geniuses.
1711760	1714460	Didn't Dino bring apron along?
1715160	1718760	Apron seems like somebody that would hang out with Dino.
1720260	1723660	Who is with you and Dino when you guys are traipsing around
1723660	1724060	New York?
1724060	1724960	Apron, right?
1725460	1727360	There are people that we run into.
1728060	1729360	Remember Peter Blood?
1730160	1732060	He showed up for a little cameo.
1732160	1732560	Okay.
1732560	1733160	Excellent.
1733260	1734760	Do you know his friend Tom met us out?
1734760	1738460	I bought Dino a tiny cactus at a tiny cactus store.
1739960	1744660	We he talked to an old fella on the sidewalk about something.
1744660	1745860	I don't know what they were talking about.
1745860	1747960	I think they're crazy conversation sounds like a fucked up
1747960	1748860	Jim Croci song.
1748960	1751660	They were talking about God or something or maybe I'm projecting
1751660	1754060	that because the guy had a yamacon and he was like very he
1754060	1757760	seemed to kind of philosophical.
1758460	1761760	Okay, but they might have been talking about fucking blue apron.
1761760	1762260	I don't know.
1762660	1769860	I'm sure they were were they like, hey, give me blue apron
1769860	1770460	coming.
1771260	1773160	What give you blue apron coming?
1774260	1774660	Thanks.
1774660	1774960	Sorry.
1774960	1775360	Sorry.
1775360	1776260	Can you do apron?
1776260	1777360	Sorry the show.
1777460	1780860	My favorite thing is in the about blue apron ads in particular
1780860	1786060	and podcasting is because when you listen to true crime podcast
1786060	1789260	a lot, there's a very often a very like like it's as if they're
1789260	1793460	doing a bit like it's like like like talking about a horrible
1793460	1796560	murder with something that happens and then there's like
1796560	1800760	no seem to going into like having this food delivered to
1800760	1801260	your house.
1801260	1802160	That's kind of funny.
1802360	1803260	That's the best.
1803860	1804760	I love that.
1804760	1806260	It's like when they're like we're going to be here all night
1806260	1807060	to solve in this case.
1807160	1808360	We should probably get some blue apron.
1808760	1809960	Well or worse.
1809960	1810660	No, it's no.
1810660	1813860	It's more like her mangled body had been eaten by her own cats
1813860	1817160	before officers got to the scene and the odor was attracting
1817160	1817960	the police.
1818360	1822460	I love a cord squash and I cook with my kids all the time and
1822460	1828260	when I do that's so I mean it definitely with shows like that
1828260	1831360	it seems like you really could sell products because like you're
1831360	1833260	instilling just utter fear.
1833260	1835660	Oh, yeah, like the kind of thing that makes you not want to leave
1835660	1838260	your house when you're not leaving your house, you know, you got
1838260	1839260	to have groceries.
1839460	1840760	You know, that's what television is.
1840760	1843960	Television is telling you do not stop watching this television
1843960	1849260	like like, you know, like you go get a car but but drive it
1849260	1850760	back here and keep watching TV.
1850860	1851260	Right.
1854760	1855760	What do you think Rob?
1856960	1860760	I think I find it I was thinking about this.
1860760	1865660	I find it strange that the theme to fall guy
1866660	1871760	Was more concerned with letting me know that Lee Majors was
1871760	1875460	heterosexual and then focused on the stunt work.
1875460	1879860	What was the I just remember these that the kind of kissing
1879860	1882760	tail, but I've thought ladies plenty.
1884360	1887860	I'm just like, yeah, and then you jumped over fire.
1889160	1891060	No, Sally fields.
1891460	1892860	You've been with a girl.
1893860	1896960	Okay, but well, I've left six feet over simmering pussy.
1896960	1903860	Yeah, yeah, not the kind of kissing tail, but I'm listen.
1903860	1908460	I'm heterosexual straight as a I don't hug my male friends.
1910460	1912360	I'm really into pussy.
1912360	1915660	Why does everybody keep asking me if I like it?
1917060	1921160	I mean like I mean like really I mean like they lead with that.
1921160	1925560	I'm not the kind of kiss and tell but and then he goes into
1925560	1927060	how many women he's.
1928360	1930060	I thought Dino told the story.
1930060	1934860	I was really funny about his dad who is no longer with us.
1934860	1937060	So we majors this will be fine.
1937560	1941760	We're just defiling his memory, but but there they were watching
1941760	1945860	Dino was watching a Woody Allen movie and his dad was in the
1945860	1950360	room and then did the Woody Allen had a line about the Greeks
1950360	1955360	inventing homosexuality and Dino's dad got up to pause to
1955360	1959860	the tape and lectured Dino about how that's not true.
1960460	1964460	The reason that rumor got started is because the Romans made
1964460	1968960	made everyone suck their dicks and then kept the replay the
1968960	1971760	movie and let us that his son just absorb.
1972960	1973660	Is that true?
1973660	1974960	Is that how we got it?
1974960	1979060	Yeah, it really it really cleans up Greek history.
1979060	1982260	Doesn't it like it's a you really cook you any shame you
1982260	1985360	went into as a Greek you're definitely coming out the other
1985360	1987760	side of that one renewed.
1988360	1993360	Didn't the Romans steal the Greek religions mythologies
1993360	1994060	and stuff?
1994060	1996960	Didn't they just like turn Zeus into Jupiter?
1997060	1998260	Yeah, maybe that's me.
1998260	1999460	It's the same thing.
1999460	2000660	Yeah, I like that.
2000660	2002360	It's a New York sort of battle.
2002360	2004760	That's still sort of going on like the group between the
2004760	2005960	Greeks and the Romans.
2006660	2009760	You know, the real truth is those fucking Romans these fucking
2009760	2010760	Romans did this.
2010860	2012060	Yeah, you always forget.
2012060	2013260	Yeah, Romans.
2013360	2017160	That's funny to imagine Romans as Italians, which they technically
2017160	2019960	were but it's just funny to imagine them in those those
2019960	2021960	outfits, but talking like Robert De Niro.
2024860	2031260	Mark McKinney, they were asking people to do De Niro impressions
2031260	2034260	in this deadline interview to pimping people to do impressions
2034260	2036160	is like kind of like boy, what are we how are we going to
2036160	2038360	get around this and make it funny?
2038860	2043360	But Mark McKinney's impression of De Niro is put down that
2043360	2043960	fish.
2045660	2047460	I kept making him do it all weekend.
2047460	2048160	It's very funny.
2048260	2048660	I like that.
2048660	2051760	It's just like a plaintiff whiny non-existent line from
2051760	2052460	some weird.
2056060	2058860	No matter what actor you were if that were the your catch
2058860	2060760	phrase when people did impressions of you'd be like,
2060760	2061860	Ash, I'm gonna do something.
2061860	2062860	I'm gonna be a dentist.
2062960	2064360	I don't want to be an actor anymore.
2064860	2066960	Why did I why did I star in that movie?
2069060	2071660	We try to figure out the title of the movie was and McKinney
2071660	2073660	said don't talk to me with a fish in your hand.
2075860	2077960	I got a big crush on him as you can tell I liked I liked
2077960	2078760	hanging out with him.
2078760	2079560	He's very charming.
2082260	2084760	I don't I don't I don't it sounds like you had a really
2084760	2085160	good time.
2085160	2087960	It's not like there's a if you're if you're if you're
2087960	2093960	a you know, Bruce McAuliffe and you're listening.
2093960	2097560	I I didn't I can't remember if I met you but I didn't
2097560	2098260	dislike you.
2098260	2100960	I'm not saying that you're saying you have a favorite
2100960	2101660	member now.
2102360	2105060	It's like I think you think you might be the most compatible
2105060	2108660	with me at all of them.
2109460	2110860	So everybody.
2111960	2112560	I don't know about that.
2112560	2113460	They're all pretty sweet.
2113660	2114460	They're all very sweet.
2114460	2115860	They're all really really really smart.
2115960	2117160	Yeah, but I like him the best.
2118160	2119360	You haven't met the other ones.
2121360	2121960	I met a guy.
2121960	2123460	I met I think I've met him all again.
2123460	2123560	Now.
2123560	2125660	I can't remember if I ever met Bruce McCauley.
2126060	2128160	I met I met I met Dave Foley.
2128160	2129360	I've met Scott Thompson.
2129360	2130760	I met Kevin McDonald.
2131960	2133960	Didn't you yell at Kevin McDonald out of your car
2133960	2139360	window or did I know I was going to yell at David Cross
2139360	2143760	one time before we met him like going I'm in the show
2143760	2147860	or whatever before before we just like
2147860	2150460	moved to Los Angeles and we saw him walking down the
2150460	2154460	street and I was I said I should roll down the window
2154460	2155360	and yell mr.
2155360	2159960	Show at him and I and I didn't I think I told Dan I
2159960	2160860	was thinking about doing that.
2160860	2164860	I'm glad I didn't because that would have been I David
2164860	2167360	would not have thought that was awesome.
2167360	2170760	He would know he would have you would have let you have
2170760	2170960	it.
2171360	2174660	Well, we were moving in a vehicle right.
2174660	2177160	Well, I wouldn't have if he did he would have been saying
2177160	2179460	up my bumper cross fast though.
2179960	2181560	There's a one thing we don't know about cross.
2181560	2183260	He runs really fast.
2183860	2187260	That's why they call across the country David Cross.
2187260	2191560	The funny thing is I swear it was like 4 a.m.
2191560	2194060	It was ungodly like the Sun was up because I remember
2194060	2197060	it was broad daylight, but it was like so late.
2197060	2198660	It was like there was nobody on the road.
2198660	2202860	I was driving back to my apartment for probably from
2202860	2206360	some god knows like some who knows a naughty party at
2206360	2207660	an apartment if his 4 a.m.
2207660	2209260	Maybe there was coke involved.
2209260	2209560	I don't know.
2209560	2212660	I was I was like probably stayed on someone's couch.
2212660	2215660	So I wasn't too drunk to drive and I was coming home
2215660	2220260	very very wee hours of the morning and and at the
2220260	2224560	intersection right over by my house like like it's just
2224560	2231660	this deserted subdivision this car is coming rolling up
2231660	2233060	to the same stop sign.
2233060	2234760	He's kind of he's kind of rolling the stop sign.
2234760	2237260	He got there way earlier than me but didn't come to a full
2237260	2239760	stop which was fine.
2239760	2242860	I wasn't it wasn't like the person was doing anything
2242860	2243960	really that wrong.
2243960	2248860	It was just but but it the car was in the middle of the
2248860	2252660	intersection as I approached it and then it was David
2252660	2259360	Cross and he looked at my car coming up to the stop sign
2259360	2262460	and he and he took both hands off the wheel of the car
2262460	2265460	and put them both on the on the glass of his on the driver
2265460	2269860	side of his car and did this like insane like oh my god.
2269860	2274660	I'm going to die like like performance like as if my car
2274660	2278560	was barreling towards him and he was screaming in in terror
2278560	2280160	and then he just kept going.
2280160	2283460	I was like that was David Cross where you see he just did
2283460	2287260	a bit for me and this is I've never met he did he oh he
2287260	2289060	never met him and then I met him eventually.
2289260	2293360	I think I probably brought that up and and how did he remember
2293360	2294160	because that's right.
2294260	2294760	Sorry.
2294760	2295260	I'm sorry.
2296060	2297060	You're sorry for what?
2297260	2297560	I'm sorry.
2297560	2299160	I can't remember because that's the next question.
2299160	2300860	Well, then you do meet David Cross.
2300860	2302060	Did you ever tell him that story?
2302060	2302960	And what did he say?
2302960	2305160	That's that's obviously a very frustrating thing to not be
2305160	2305760	able to tell you.
2305760	2306260	It's sorry.
2306260	2306760	People want to know.
2306760	2307860	It's what everybody wants to know.
2307860	2311160	Yeah, everybody wants to know that we were in where it goes
2311160	2312460	and then we became good friends.
2312460	2316060	Yeah, it's it's it's it's it's it's really irresponsible of
2316060	2317360	me to not have that information.
2317560	2319960	Do you think that he was maybe a little do you think he was
2319960	2321460	coming from the same place you were coming from?
2321760	2326360	Well, you mean you mean you mean lifestyle wise I probably
2326360	2327860	I don't make me maybe more.
2327860	2329560	I mean it was just that time of the morning.
2329560	2330760	Like where where else would he be?
2330760	2331960	He's not he's not a milkman.
2336360	2338060	Yeah, anyways.
2339460	2341360	Oh, who's the first famous person here?
2342060	2345460	Remember wasn't it David Duchovny that we were in that
2345560	2346960	David Duchovny.
2347360	2348460	Did we meet David?
2348460	2352460	I've never met I I don't think I've ever met.
2352460	2353260	That was the answer.
2353260	2353960	Yeah, you're right.
2353960	2355060	It was okay.
2355260	2356860	It sounded like you were correcting me like his real
2356860	2357960	name's Michael Duchovny.
2357960	2362160	Oh, no, I was confirming or affirming your we were in a
2362160	2364860	sushi restaurant and with our eating like for one of the
2364860	2371160	first times with our agent Blair Belcher at UTA and Rob
2371460	2379160	but David Duchovny is behind you and I and I and I and I
2379160	2385860	went David Duchovny and turned around and a David Duchovny
2385860	2389160	who was quite literally right behind me sitting back to
2389160	2391360	back with me in a tiny restaurant.
2391360	2393960	I feel like his chair was touching my therefore he just
2393960	2399360	he heard his name and I so I turned around to see a confused
2399860	2402160	David Duchovny's nostrils in my face.
2403860	2406260	And then and then and then I turned back around and focus
2406260	2407760	on anything in our agent player.
2407760	2410160	It was like she chuckled and said you got to treat him
2410160	2410860	like ghosts.
2411360	2415360	Oh, no, the worst the worst them.
2415860	2419360	So we started banging some ceremonial sticks together.
2420860	2421860	Yeah, I just shrieked
2430360	2433060	like that.
2433060	2435460	You're supposed to treat Mr.
2435460	2436260	Duchovny.
2436260	2437260	I'm sorry.
2439260	2440360	You're ghost training.
2442160	2444460	Did you make your did you halfway do that?
2444460	2446960	You're like, I better make this Native American chanting
2446960	2449660	so sloppy that it's not offensive.
2450960	2451560	I'm gonna go.
2451560	2452260	Oh, yeah.
2452260	2452560	Oh, yeah.
2452560	2452960	I better go.
2452960	2465560	Oh, I like that observation.
2465560	2466860	The celebrities are like ghosts.
2466860	2470160	They they in LA there because there's millions of them
2470160	2471960	everywhere and they dress funny.
2471960	2473260	You think they're lonely though.
2473260	2475860	I mean, here's what I think Rob.
2476060	2480860	I think they're starved for very very casual normal conversation
2480860	2483860	that normal people have when they're, you know, sharing a
2483860	2486860	bus stop because people are just like, oh, you're the guy
2486860	2489260	from the thing or people are like, I'm a big fan, but people
2489260	2492760	aren't just all like fucking the Steelers, right or whatever
2492760	2496160	like I feel like they hate because all their interactions
2496160	2500360	are just so rarefied and not normal and they must have lived
2500760	2502360	with normal interactions before.
2502960	2504860	Yeah, I think you do Barry more.
2504860	2507160	I think I can answer this as an internet celebrity.
2507460	2511660	It's great when people talk to you and I hate it.
2512060	2513860	I love I love the hits.
2514060	2514960	I'm really into the hits.
2514960	2516760	We talk a lot about the hits branding.
2518860	2521660	So people when you see me feel free to just come up to me
2521660	2524760	randomly and speak about some of my great internet videos.
2526760	2530260	Oh, and you see if you see me tell me about any cool new blue
2530260	2531160	blue apron meals.
2531160	2534160	You've had what's the biggest you fucked up with a celebrity
2534160	2536860	like like I think I think Fred Savage probably
2537460	2541560	Fred Savage, but I think I made him hate me in two seconds.
2542660	2543260	Okay.
2543260	2545160	Let's hear this.
2545160	2547960	He was just Fred Savage.
2547960	2549860	He was at a GQ.
2551060	2552560	Gentleman's quarterly.
2553460	2556460	It was like they have GQ as a party where it's like.
2557660	2560660	I can't I there's some something in their magazine like the
2560660	2564360	hundred most what kind of party was it?
2564460	2565660	What kind of what was it?
2565660	2569060	What kind of party what was what was what was the decorations
2569060	2571160	like what were they serving?
2571560	2572660	Tell the story.
2572760	2574060	It's at a party.
2574460	2578560	I don't need to know you're you're the what's what music
2578560	2583560	were they playing before you stupid Rob for relief.
2584960	2588060	I'm going to just complain about someone telling a story.
2588060	2590660	I was I was so much.
2590860	2595060	Why do you hate me just cold cold and callous?
2595460	2599160	It's great people to think that I went to the kinds of parties
2599160	2600760	where Fred Savage is just hanging out.
2600760	2601960	It was more of a function.
2601960	2604560	You know, I don't know how good and how great this story is
2604560	2606660	because I want to hear how you fucked over Fred Savage.
2606660	2610660	Oh, I just like I was to I was introduced to him and you
2610660	2611860	know, he's a he's a director.
2611860	2617760	He's a TV director and you know, and he's long since been
2617760	2622160	Fred Savage director producer, you know, respected by his
2622460	2626660	friends and colleagues, you know, not treated like a fucking
2626660	2632160	circus freak because you happen to be on a TV show and I
2632160	2633660	fucking idiot from Milwaukee.
2633660	2637060	So I was he was talking about like he said, oh you should
2637260	2639160	try the shrimp.
2639160	2640160	I'm making this up.
2640160	2643160	I had like like some some some some small talk like like
2643160	2646660	like the shrimp just the shrimp appetizers are really good.
2646960	2651260	And I and I said when you when you're eating the shrimp
2651260	2655260	appetizers does does Daniel Stern say that they're delicious
2655660	2662060	in your head Dan and he he looked at me like like that.
2665660	2666260	Well, of course, you love it.
2666260	2667260	You're not Fred Savage.
2668060	2670760	He didn't like it, but I don't I also don't want to tell the
2670760	2674560	story in a way that makes him sound like he was petty or
2674560	2675060	defensive.
2675060	2677060	You know, I mean, I don't think anyway, he looked at me
2677060	2680460	like I farted and was like like whoo stinks in here.
2680460	2682460	You know, it's like it's like he just looked at me like like
2682460	2684860	like okay, well, how do you expect me to you know, like he
2684860	2686660	just okay, let me ask you a question.
2686660	2687360	Let me ask you.
2687360	2690860	Let me answer your question because you're famous and you
2690860	2696760	have fans and you've had fans who have not hit it out of
2696760	2700260	the park a couple of times in person.
2700260	2705060	I do say the majority and have they have they come up to
2705060	2708460	you and said something like well any or whatever and and you
2708460	2712260	go or are you every time somebody just reminds you of
2712260	2715560	something you made your your you're like, oh, that's sweet.
2715560	2716160	That's cool.
2716160	2718060	I honestly, yeah, I know they let the ladder.
2718060	2721360	I honestly cannot think I have I had one encounter.
2721360	2727160	I can remember with with a guy that I did not like and it
2727160	2730760	was a guy it was at the when we were on tour doing the
2730760	2731360	Harmontown thing.
2731360	2735960	It was in Somerville and the guy turned out to be he was
2735960	2740660	a drunk guy that had wandered in and only knew that I was
2741160	2742760	famous didn't know who I was.
2742760	2745360	So it was why the conversation was insulting and knobbish
2745360	2750860	and and and clang and like all about him and and but but
2750860	2755460	so that means that literally I've never really had a bad
2755460	2757860	encounter with a Dan Harmon fan.
2757860	2758460	Well, that's good.
2758460	2760260	People are pretty straightforward.
2760260	2763860	They they don't they don't they don't there's no bit to do.
2763860	2765160	Yeah, they say mr.
2765160	2768760	Harmon or or are you Dan Harmon and then they and then they
2768760	2770560	they're very flat streets ahead.
2770560	2773260	You're like, oh, yeah, I certainly wouldn't punish anyone
2773260	2776960	for for really anything because I always think like this is
2776960	2780560	something that you can't control and that is going to be gone
2780560	2783660	one day and you're going to you know, you suck it up like a
2783660	2787860	like like like even though even even if it's like not that
2787860	2790560	this has ever really happened, but even if it's not opportune,
2790560	2794360	you know, like but but it's never an in opportune time to
2794360	2798660	approach me because I'm I'm not as as I hear celebrities
2798660	2802660	sometimes say ever eating or with people, right?
2802660	2804960	I may look like I am but I'm I'm inside.
2804960	2806060	I'm screaming out.
2806060	2809660	I wonder if anyone recognizes me and I love hearing the
2809660	2811660	answer is yes, you damn right.
2811660	2815260	It's a great byproduct because it makes me feel like I can
2815260	2818260	delay most of the work that I'm doing in therapy by another
2818260	2821760	10 years because I'm not a normal person.
2821760	2823060	I'm not perceived that way.
2823060	2828660	So why would I learn to acquire a good indicator of when it's
2828660	2832060	over with yeah, because when they stop doing that it's it's
2832060	2833760	over with yeah, right.
2833760	2834160	Yeah.
2834660	2837460	Well, oh wait, is that oh?
2839060	2840360	You mean the career?
2843560	2846760	When are we going to talk about what's on the chair?
2846760	2846960	Yeah.
2846960	2849560	Oh my gosh, why is this that's right?
2849560	2850460	I brought that up.
2850560	2853560	Why'd you buy a case for Dan's iPad that you've been borrowed?
2853560	2858460	Oh, no, no, no, if you weren't here the other way, I gave
2858460	2860460	back Dan's iPad.
2860460	2860760	Let's run.
2860760	2862260	Oh, I just assumed that was for show.
2862260	2871360	We don't have it and I I this iPad Pro was sent to me from
2871360	2876060	our own Kevin Day who works on Harmon town and he and he wrote
2876060	2879760	me and he's like hey big fan.
2879860	2881760	I heard you were you're down.
2882860	2888060	I had an extra one of these iPad Pros and a pencil and I
2888060	2891360	thought if this little tiny thing.
2893160	2896160	That I did could just make you just a little bit happier.
2896160	2897460	Wow, I'm going to do it.
2897460	2901760	Oh, come on and do it and I was like Kevin that I'm touched.
2901760	2903660	Thank you so much for doing that.
2903660	2905260	I mean, it's strange.
2905460	2910160	I've I've known this guy maybe a year and a half.
2910160	2913560	Yeah, and yeah, and he lives in he doesn't live in Los Angeles.
2913560	2915460	It's not like he lives in my neighborhood, right?
2915960	2919460	He mailed it was sent it out to me.
2919460	2922060	Well, you must have mailed it from like maybe the next state
2922060	2923160	over or something.
2924360	2926560	I mean, have you talked about this with him before?
2926760	2928360	No, he's just a fan.
2928360	2932160	He hears me and that that, you know, I've been depressed.
2932160	2932960	I've lost my way.
2932960	2934660	I don't know if I can go on anymore.
2934660	2940760	I just you know, just and I did and we had this thing with
2940760	2946660	Dan's I there was a miscommunication and I bear the
2946660	2950260	brunt of it, but it's it's over with now, but this is a really
2950260	2955160	really nice like byproduct of that and I said, you know, you
2955160	2957960	know, Kevin, I was like, you know, you know, you're you're
2957960	2961360	really good friend now and you always you've been since I've
2961360	2961760	met you.
2961760	2966160	You're a nice guy and and you know, you're a friend and
2966160	2970060	you're not you're not, you know, responsible for my feelings,
2970060	2973060	you know, it's it's but but thank you for this and he goes
2973260	2974060	whoa, whoa, whoa.
2975160	2976760	Shrob, what did you just say?
2976760	2978260	I said, you're not responsible for my feelings.
2978260	2980260	Whoa, that's not true.
2980260	2980760	Wow.
2981460	2984460	I come on care about your feelings.
2985160	2988260	Therefore, I take responsibility for your feelings.
2988260	2989960	And I was blown away.
2990060	2992460	It looks like it looks like a legacy iPad.
2992460	2996260	Is that like a series one really really really nice?
2996260	2997260	I mean, I don't know.
2997260	2999660	I mean, that's that's technical or whatever right now.
2999660	3001760	Was that just that was just what I was just like drawing
3001760	3005560	some stuff, you know before, you know, I came on here and
3005560	3008060	it's just and it's great because you know, can we take a
3008060	3008760	look at what you are?
3008760	3012060	Was it expensive to get that iPad then?
3014360	3015060	That was a gift.
3015660	3018060	It was it didn't cost you a lot of money.
3018260	3019060	It was a gift.
3019960	3021160	I know where you're going with this.
3021360	3022560	I know where you're going with this.
3022560	3023660	Where it's over with.
3023660	3024760	What are you talking about?
3025060	3026360	What are you talking about?
3026760	3028160	Honestly, I'm offended.
3028160	3028860	It's done.
3028860	3031060	If we're going to if you're going to jump down my throat
3031060	3033560	every time I ask you questions about the nice things you
3033560	3036860	bring to show off to our friends, then then we could do
3036860	3038060	that every time.
3038260	3041560	But I'm just trying to share in your excitement with this
3041560	3045460	fun thing that you got and you know, try and talk up and
3045460	3049860	try and know your voice better by expressing how expensive
3050060	3050660	lower your voice.
3050660	3051160	I'm right here.
3051160	3054960	I can't even always tell each other how to need to talk.
3054960	3056960	You're literally you have a microphone.
3056960	3059960	You just stop shouting at me and I can hear myself really
3059960	3062560	well through the monitors even with this microphone is
3062560	3063460	great up shouting.
3064260	3065160	You're embarrassing yourself.
3065360	3069260	Listen, once you guys share, you know, this is something
3069260	3069760	I drew.
3070260	3072360	Oh, yeah, that's pretty cool.
3072360	3072960	You like that?
3072960	3074160	You show that to the gang.
3074160	3076460	Okay, but it's not be time for them to read that.
3076460	3076660	Yeah.
3076660	3078660	Yeah, let's take so I drew this.
3078860	3079960	It's pretty cool.
3081960	3087360	It is a lot of you know, like just like different different
3087960	3090460	pens that you can use and filters.
3090460	3094260	This is I'm not sure what brush this is, but I really like
3094260	3094560	it.
3094560	3096960	Do you remember what inspired that particular word that I
3096960	3099160	just you know, I was saying for that piece.
3099160	3104960	I just like you know, like the name for this.
3104960	3106660	Yeah, universal question.
3107160	3110960	And I understand that that's a metaphor for something real.
3111060	3114760	Isn't that, you know, I think it's up to interpretation.
3114760	3117960	You look at it and I want the audience to look at it and
3117960	3118760	just let go.
3118960	3120060	How does this make you feel?
3120060	3124060	I mean, like, you know, what is yeah, so I mean, I guess
3124060	3127660	you have yeah, because that is a that is an inspirational
3127660	3127960	piece.
3127960	3131260	If you if you'd like to see Rob's art will upload it to
3131260	3135760	the Instagram or I can tell you it says why am I not going
3135760	3145860	to Boston in childish scrolling now calligraphy the language
3145860	3147760	that Ben Franklin invented.
3148160	3152360	If you'd like a low-cost iPad try honey.
3152360	3156560	It's a service that installs a coupon detector on your web
3156760	3157460	browser.
3157560	3160660	Oh man, you could save so much money within two clicks.
3160660	3162860	You could have a very affordable product.
3163960	3164860	Oh man.
3166760	3167660	Oh man.
3168760	3169560	Oh man.

3176760	3177260	holy shit.
3177260	3178460	You're that fucking high.
3178460	3181260	He just said wow, you're that fucking.
3181260	3182760	Oh, no, I'm blasted.
3182860	3184860	Yeah, I think so.
3184860	3185360	Yeah.
3185360	3187260	I don't think you know what room you're in.
3187360	3188260	Let's back off.
3188260	3189460	All right, don't harsh it.
3189660	3190960	Don't harsh his buds.
3190960	3192460	Hi drug weed.

3195860	3197260	which way this whole evening.

3234160	3235660	I'm going to say in front of all these people.
3237160	3237960	Pick your shots.
3238760	3239160	That's up.
3239160	3240260	You ever see that clip?
3240360	3245160	No, Richard Burrell like like coming down on Richard Pryor
3245160	3249960	on Dick Cavett was it or it was either Dick Cavett or like
3249960	3251860	not Phil Donahue the other one.
3251860	3255460	It was a talk show like of that time, but it was it was
3255460	3258260	because Richard Pryor kept like laughing like he started
3258260	3262460	laughing at Milton Burrell who because Milton Burrell was
3262460	3263860	trying to share.
3263860	3267960	He was sharing like some sentiment about some about a
3267960	3268460	divorce.
3268460	3272360	He had or he asked this woman to have an abortion or something
3272760	3277260	fucking heavy and Richard Pryor was like couldn't stop laughing
3277260	3282360	Wow, and and Milton Burrell got pissed off, but it's like
3282460	3284760	dude, you you're a comedian.
3284760	3287260	Why are you talking about this heart?
3287760	3288560	It's crazy.
3288560	3292560	Also cocaine also cocaine also cocaine.
3293160	3295660	He was also tired, but it's a it's a it's a there are clips
3295660	3298160	of Richard Pryor where you're like, oh that feels a little
3299160	3302460	you know, you're a little less on his side than than on it,
3302460	3304560	but that's that's a clip where you're on Richard Pryor side
3304560	3309460	because Milton Burrell is talking about some lady in his
3309460	3312660	life that he kind of you know went through and had this
3312660	3313560	horrible impact on it.
3313560	3315860	He said he's not it's not he's not a policy.
3315860	3320360	He's not he's not he's he's sort of as I recall that the tone
3320360	3324960	of of what he's saying is kind of like I get he's kind of
3324960	3328760	patting himself on the back about about about how altruistic
3328760	3329760	he is or something.
3329760	3330560	I can't really remember.
3330560	3333760	It's it it's it's it's when Richard Pryor starts laughing.
3333760	3337160	It's like you you agree that it's like it's much it's got
3337160	3339860	to be hard to sit on that couch and without laughing.
3340160	3344460	It did seem like there was like the old school of comedy
3344460	3348060	and the new school of comedy just butting heads and the old
3348060	3353060	school was like at that moment going is just fighting to
3353060	3356160	stay on top but is losing the battle.
3356160	3359060	You know, it's like it's time to time to back off.
3359060	3361560	There's a prior Chevy Chase that is like that when they're
3361560	3362460	on the Tonight Show.
3362460	3363260	Oh, yeah, I saw that one.
3363260	3364260	Yeah. Oh, yeah.
3364260	3367960	Richard Pryor is not pleased with Chevy Chase and it's sort
3367960	3369060	of like really.
3369060	3369560	Well, I didn't.
3369560	3373560	Yeah, I make more money than you Chevy watch is really trying
3373560	3375960	to like he's new and he's really trying to be on the good side
3375960	3377760	of people, but he doesn't have it.
3377760	3379960	Yeah, it's it's interesting.
3380960	3385860	It was like literally like a sort of a frat boy meets a street
3385860	3386360	fighter.
3386860	3390860	We just learned or just had it confirmed recently that

4123060	4126060	Party dancing around Ghostbusters.
4126060	4131860	Yeah, three, two, one.
4131860	4132660	Happy.
4132660	4145560	Yeah, I went to the bathroom and keep in mind.
4145560	4149160	It's not like the pill goes into your body and then goes
4149160	4154060	down on top of the softball size turd that's lodged in your
4154060	4156460	rectum and turns that soft.
4156760	4164260	It's what it does do is it lubricates the muzzle of the
4164260	4170360	gun to the point where the bullet comes is now fireable.
4170560	4180260	And so I shot a basketball of diamond shit into I think I
4180260	4182060	think I crapped the ceramic.
4183060	4189560	I did it was and then and then and then learned what was
4189560	4192060	happening under that cork.
4192060	4196660	Yeah for the last six hours, which was Loch Ness.
4196860	4200760	Yeah, it was it was a Kennedy autopsy.
4200760	4206460	It was it is crazy that the body will how should we say it
4206460	4211160	will betray you because it will be a cork which is what led
4211160	4215260	to lead to this constipation was the cork and then behind
4215260	4218960	the cork is this fine rich wine wine.
4219660	4221760	And then as soon as you pop the cork you think to yourself
4221760	4222960	I'm pop cork and drink this wine.
4222960	4223960	It's gonna be such a party.
4223960	4224960	We're gonna drink this wine.
4225460	4229460	No, you pop the cork and the wine makes you wish you have
4229460	4230060	more cork.
4230060	4230460	Yeah.
4230460	4230660	Yeah.
4230660	4231860	I wanted my cork back.
4231860	4235060	You're you're you're essentially a victim of yourself.
4235060	4238060	Yeah, then you got to wonder is this thing going to flush?
4238160	4240660	It's like like I don't even what do I do?
4241060	4243260	What if you do what you did at the karaoke party?
4243260	4245660	You just walk or you leave the parties walk out.
4245660	4246060	Let's go.
4246060	4246760	Good luck.
4246860	4249560	Also, you were in a you're in a jumpsuit.
4249960	4250560	Correct.
4250560	4251460	Yeah, exactly.
4251460	4254660	I got a styrofoam proton pack on and yeah.
4255260	4256160	Oh boy.
4257460	4258960	Yeah, I was yeah.
4258960	4261960	Yeah, I guess I was I had my I had sleeves around my knees.
4261960	4265160	Yeah, and and and and a proton pack next to it.
4265160	4267060	Let's say let's run that footage.
4268460	4270160	No, okay, that's fine.
4270260	4271160	It would be a man.
4271160	4274760	We really never record the moments that we should from our
4274760	4275360	life.
4277560	4280060	Hopefully we'll all have like black mirror like like, you
4280060	4280960	know contacts.
4280960	4283860	They got they're making drones that can fly around and just
4283860	4286560	like be a personal camera now when they get those batteries
4286560	4286760	up.
4286760	4287460	That'd be crazy.
4287460	4290160	Just have people like, you know, live blogging their whole
4290160	4293660	lives from like an autonomous drone that's filming them.
4294560	4297360	I'd be fucking with a little insect sized drones.
4297360	4300460	I think it's like the cameras like a little box and then
4300460	4303460	the quad rotors are just this really thin things that goes
4303460	4305160	out of the box and it's maybe I don't know.
4305360	4309460	That's that's how the shit felt quad rotors Brandon.
4309460	4310960	Do you have any celebrity stories?
4311760	4314860	I fucking ruin every opportunity I get to meet a celebrity.
4315860	4317460	It's why I mostly do animation now.
4319460	4321360	It's gonna hide you recorded separate times.
4321360	4326660	I I punked people for the Ashton Kuchner and that that is
4326660	4328660	that involves fucking a lot of people are right.
4328660	4329560	They probably love that.
4329560	4332260	So, you know that that was that was pretty awful.
4332760	4334760	Well, that would be a fucking nightmare.
4334760	4336760	What was the punks that you were like?
4337560	4339360	This is gonna go way bad.
4339360	4343160	I don't what were we thinking was was there anything that
4343160	4346760	went like there was like Mackenzie Phillips is like I'm
4346760	4348060	gonna fucking ruin you.
4348760	4351960	I'm gonna fucking ruin you fucking ruin you.
4351960	4353760	These garbage cans are not for sale.
4353760	4354760	Get the fuck out.
4355760	4358360	Why would you make me think I was pregnant?
4358360	4360260	That's not funny shit.
4360560	4363860	I've been trying for three months Mackenzie Phillips.
4363860	4369460	Yeah, once we punk stalker Channing, you know, we punked.
4369460	4370060	I'm so old.
4370060	4375660	We punked Phoebe Kate Mackenzie.
4377360	4380160	I'm so old one day at a time punks.
4380760	4382660	I punked Minnie Pearl.
4383560	4389060	I punked to cast a Maude on Hee Haw.
4389060	4393360	We told Estelle Getty that we had her house keys and we did
4393360	4396760	not push Ben Vereen down some soft stairs.
4398360	4398860	It's okay.
4398860	4399860	These stairs are soft.
4399860	4402760	Look, I'm pushing on it soft.
4402760	4403560	It's gonna be okay.
4403560	4406260	I'm gonna shove Ben Vereen down the stairs for a second.
4406260	4408960	He's gonna think he's gonna break his neck when he hits the
4408960	4409360	stairs.
4409360	4411960	I thought the saw I thought the prank was that Ben Vereen
4411960	4414460	thought the stairs were soft and then you swap them out for
4414460	4415360	hard stairs.
4416260	4419860	That's the the footage that we played Ben Vereen when somebody
4419860	4423360	said they they're gonna punk you but then when he he saw after
4423360	4425960	he saw the footage who was 10 speed and Brown's you that was
4425960	4428760	Flip Wilson and go boom.
4431760	4433660	10 speed and Brown's you Google that shit.
4433660	4435360	You fucking millennial cyborgs.
4435460	4435660	Yeah.
4435660	4436460	Look it up.
4436860	4440560	No, should we are we gonna I don't know are we I got a
4441260	4446060	I don't think Spencer's in any shape to D or D.
4446060	4448060	Yeah, I'm fucking blasted.
4448760	4450560	Although Jeff's gonna be gone for a while.
4450560	4453760	So that's certainly no reason not to play D&D because he's
4453760	4456860	if we're not gonna wait for Jeff to come back to play D&D
4456860	4459260	because that motherfucker is just bailed.
4459260	4459560	Yeah.
4459560	4462160	Well, that's the thing is like well, that's why you can't stop
4462160	4464660	is cuz when you start making allowances then there's only
4464660	4465760	a little bit from there.
4466760	4467660	I don't give a fuck.
4467660	4468460	Yeah, it's hard.
4468460	4470160	Just don't accept a promise from Jeff Davis.
4470160	4474160	That's what I that's my my motto here.
4474160	4477160	That's all it took a huge broken promise.
4477160	4478160	Yeah, that's all it took.
4478260	4480860	So I pissed off Lin-Manuel Miranda.
4480960	4482360	Oh man shit.
4482360	4482960	Oh man.
4482960	4490660	Well on on Twitter, you know, that that ponytail prodigy.
4490760	4491260	Damn.
4491260	4494460	I guess long hair because they're like you don't like the
4494460	4495260	dude and that's okay.
4495260	4496060	You don't like you.
4496660	4498660	I threw away my shot.
4500360	4505660	Yeah, but shots fired get him what so yeah, no, it's just
4505660	4508860	someone tagged him on on Twitter when I was when I was on
4508860	4513460	Twitter and so he was like you like followed me on Twitter
4513460	4514860	really quick and then he saw the thing.
4514860	4517260	I said about Hamilton, which was not nice.
4517660	4519260	And what did you say?
4519260	4519760	Come on.
4519760	4521060	It's it's not nice.
4521760	4524360	You can play Hamilton play isn't a nice play.
4524660	4527660	Yeah, I was like this place seems not nice.
4528160	4532060	See at Lin-Manuel Miranda take things seriously.
4532160	4532960	What did you say?
4532960	4534660	Yeah, let's take these seriously.
4534660	4535260	No, you're not.
4535260	4540260	You're being aggressive and and it's not nice and you're
4540260	4540960	shouting again.
4540960	4541960	So stop it.
4542060	4543960	No, don't tell me what to say.
4544260	4546060	Okay, say nothing.
4546560	4547160	Okay.
4548560	4549160	Got him.
4550160	4550760	Not bad.
4550860	4555760	All right, so it wasn't nice and it was something that he
4555760	4557060	was upset by presumably.
4557060	4559260	So then he followed me and then saw the thing and then he
4559260	4562060	unfollowed me and he was like, yeah, you know, it's not as
4562060	4565060	good as a Dan Harmon rap, but I hope someday you'll you'll
4565060	4565860	check it out.
4566060	4568860	So just totally high-roaded and then I just and I got caught
4568860	4571260	in the crossfire and I got fucking shade thrown on my
4571260	4571960	every style.
4571960	4574560	It was a it was a whole it was a whole mess.
4574760	4579360	Rediff was was on me, you know, Retta Unforgettable.
4581460	4582760	Yeah, it was it was great.
4582760	4587360	And so then not super later after I don't know.
4587360	4589860	It was it was a good deal after that, but we've we've never
4589860	4591660	interacted since I've never seen Hamilton.
4591660	4592160	Whatever.
4593060	4598960	We're doing this live read of the Starburns Castle and some
4598960	4606060	some some young 17 year old punk short hair punk comes
4606060	4609560	comes rolling up to our back door area and knock it on the
4609560	4614060	door. And so I open it up and I see this young punk and I'm
4614060	4616760	like, oh, hey, are you with the show?
4617260	4619560	You know, because I'm not going to just be all like, you
4619560	4623760	know, members only because I'm a nice guy, but still the
4623760	4627060	mood was you don't belong here, you know, even though I
4627060	4629060	was cordial about it and he had a friend with them.
4629060	4631260	And so it's like, are these kids think this is the back
4631260	4631960	door or whatever?
4632160	4633860	And you know, it turns out Lin ran.
4633860	4636160	Well, Randy doesn't have a ponytail anymore.
4636160	4641260	And so it's like, yeah, and I was like, oh, and so he's like,
4641260	4642260	yeah, yeah.
4642260	4643460	And I was like, oh, what's your name?
4643460	4647160	And he was like, Lynn and so Lynn is a fucking the name any
4647160	4650360	Dan Harmon fan would have just a normal fucking weird weirdo
4650360	4651760	name. And I'm like, oh, Lynn.
4652160	4655860	And then so I kind of slowly and awkwardly back up to let
4655860	4659960	him in and then he's with his friend and then and then he
4659960	4662860	can tell that I haven't like I'm still like my guards up
4662860	4664260	or like I don't know what's happening.
4664260	4667860	I see he he can tell I haven't clocked that it's him right
4667860	4670760	and then and then he holds his hand out to shake me and
4670760	4672160	he's shake my hand.
4672160	4673160	No shake you.
4673560	4675260	Yeah, no, he's he grabbed me.
4675260	4676960	He shakes me with one arm.
4676960	4677360	Thank you.
4677360	4679160	My legs are off the floor.
4680460	4682960	And he starts rapping to the rhythm of the shaking.
4682960	4686560	He throws me away like he wouldn't have done to his shot.
4687060	4690160	It's the second second Joe reference on the same concept.
4690160	4694060	Anyway, he shakes my hand and he's like, I'm a huge huge fan
4694060	4695260	and right in that moment.
4695260	4698560	I'm like, he's Lin-Manuel Miranda and then I'm like and
4698560	4700760	then I was like, thank you.
4700760	4703860	And then like I kind of just turn immediately away like
4703860	4704860	because it's just awkward.
4704860	4708960	And so it's like now this is me not recognizing him and
4708960	4712760	then hit turning his praise of me into just completely
4712760	4715460	blanking him and not returning any praise or being like,
4715460	4716860	oh my god, thank you so much.
4716860	4719260	It's such high praise, you know, and then that's the end
4719260	4720760	of that interaction for the whole night.
4720760	4723660	And it's just like this guy must think I'm the biggest
4723660	4727360	piece of shit on the planet like the most petty weird aloof
4727360	4731460	guy, you know, you you you were embarrassed.
4731760	4732660	You were an oh shit.
4732660	4737260	This is Lin-Manuel and in your embarrassment, you did a
4737360	4741060	just a quick turn, but he didn't know you were embarrassed.
4741060	4744960	So he like probably process that as oh you said I said
4744960	4747660	something nice about you and I was like, thanks and then
4747660	4748360	you moved.
4748360	4750960	Yeah, this is like that's that's how I would have processed
4750960	4751660	it to me.
4752060	4752660	I like it.
4752660	4756860	No, it's an amazing story, but it's a fucking nightmare.
4756860	4761460	I mean, he's truly it's like if I if I like broke, mr.
4761460	4762860	Rogers leg or something.
4763360	4766260	It's like truly there's not a lot of better people that
4766260	4768960	I got to be on the wrong side of never got a chance to go
4768960	4770360	like, you know, like after the show.
4770360	4774460	Hey, man, when I turned there, no, no, I'm really sorry.
4774460	4775760	I was that was too far.
4775760	4777160	This is unsquash.
4777160	4782460	Yeah, no, if you want unsquashed beef sent to your home
4782460	4786560	Blue Apron is teaming with Airbnb all this month with
4786560	4791260	honey.com to do beautiful coupons for that reminds me of
4791260	4797060	a story about somebody who is is famous, but I know that I
4797060	4800560	had an exchange was just as awkward as that one.
4800860	4806660	I was at Gelson's shopping for groceries and Tim Heidecker
4806660	4809360	can't this is years ago like right after the Sarah Silverman
4809360	4812260	program got cancelled and I see
4812260	4816160	Tim and at the time at the time like mister or not mister
4816160	4820960	of like Tim and Eric awesome show great job was still on
4820960	4825760	the air and I loved it and I still love it and every time
4825760	4827160	I saw Tim and Eric I would go.
4827160	4827960	I love your stuff.
4827960	4828960	I'm big fan.
4828960	4829460	I love it.
4829560	4833760	And so so I see Tim and and I was like this season's been
4833760	4837460	great fucking awesome really cool.
4837460	4839960	Just just such a big fan here is such an inspiration.
4839960	4844160	He's like oh, thanks so much and he leans in and he says
4844860	4846260	condolences on the show.
4848460	4853360	And here's and and he's saying condolences on the show
4853360	4856360	because Sarah Silverman program just got cancelled.
4857660	4861160	But I thought when he leaned in and sit whispered it almost
4861160	4864760	to me because he's hip comedian Tim Heidecker.
4864760	4868160	I thought he said after I said I love the show.
4868160	4871160	I love the show and he leans in and I thought he said Ken
4871160	4878360	Dolan's is on the show and I'm like holy shit.
4878360	4881160	Who's Ken Dolan's sounds familiar.
4881660	4883160	I should it's one of the monkeys.
4883160	4883860	I did.
4884160	4887860	Yeah, I should probably know that I don't want him to think
4887860	4889460	I'm square.
4889760	4892160	So I'm just going to be positive about it.
4892160	4896360	And it's a man so famous that that you have to lower your
4896360	4897760	voice to talk about him.
4897760	4903460	Don't don't don't let this but we locked Ken Dolan's and
4904160	4908260	and so he he's he's leaning in saying condolences on your
4908260	4908660	show.
4908660	4913060	It's got to suck, you know, and he and I'm thinking holy shit.
4913060	4914560	I don't want to think like a square.
4914560	4919160	So I'm going to spin this positive and I go cool with a
4919160	4920060	thumbs up.
4921160	4925960	That's so and so he so he from his point of view he goes
4926360	4928060	Hey condolences on your show.
4928260	4929260	You know being kids.
4929260	4931860	So it's got to suck and I go cool.
4933160	4938460	And he looked at me like anybody would and walked away,
4938460	4941860	you know, and it wasn't until I was halfway home driving in
4941860	4948060	the car and I went condolences on the show fuck and I haven't
4948060	4950760	never had a chance to I should have called him up.
4950760	4952160	I should have drove to his house.
4952160	4954760	I said I thought you said Ken Dolan's you're like outside
4955060	4959860	I thought you said Ken Dolan's and then he would have went
4960060	4963460	so if I did say Ken Dolan's and you didn't know who it was
4963460	4965360	you would have pretended like you did.
4965360	4967760	So you thought you were cool.
4968260	4969160	That's reasonable.
4970160	4972260	That's he'd get that yuck.
4972960	4977760	What kind of Heather's kind of gross trying to be something
4977760	4981360	you're not well, he probably tell everybody tomorrow.
4981560	4984460	Yes, you want you won't be involved in any more.
4984460	4986060	They're reindeer games.
4986260	4987660	Lick it up, baby.
4987660	4988560	Lick it.
4988660	4991060	Okay, I'm sorry.
4993760	4994860	Oh, you're destroyed.
4995260	4998060	Oh, it's over with you Monday morning.
4998660	5001160	When I tell everybody that you don't know who Ken Dolan's is
5001160	5010260	Rob Schwab Ken Dolan's is zero in Zorro Dolan's is
5011960	5016260	Zorro Fox given Ken Dolan's production.
5018660	5021760	Should we I mean among our options are what time is it now?
5021760	5023660	930 don't take a lift home.
5023660	5026760	Don't take a what don't don't take it over.
5026760	5027660	I will give you a ride.
5027660	5028460	I'll give you a ride.
5028460	5028960	Okay.
5030560	5033760	All right, so those that's one option for the night sorted
5033760	5035060	that should save me some money.
5035360	5037360	Who who are we boycotting this week?
5037860	5039360	Do I pay for your uber?
5039660	5040660	No, no, no.
5040660	5042760	I just that's going to be very affordable for me.
5042760	5044160	Stop it instigating.
5045560	5046260	I can't remember.
5046260	5047060	Instigating.
5047060	5048360	I know it's important.
5048360	5051660	I know it's important to you to take somebody is arrogant
5051660	5055960	and full of themselves and somebody who just is just just
5055960	5059460	so confident and is just riding a high-streak right now to
5059460	5060860	just put me in my place.
5061260	5063960	I know it's important to just like hey, buddy.
5064460	5067760	Yeah, remember your remember your friends, buddy.
5067960	5071960	We're not going to have this is being nice and this is what's
5071960	5073160	acceptable on a state.
5073160	5076760	Yeah, I you know, I all right.
5076760	5078060	You know, it's important.
5078060	5079060	I know it's important.
5079260	5080560	We call Poppy syndrome.
5080560	5081260	I know it's well.
5081260	5083960	You should make it less funny to pick on you.
5084060	5084960	It's funny.
5085060	5086060	It's like a pinata.
5086060	5087060	The candy comes out.
5087060	5088960	Wherever the pinata was like stop hitting me.
5088960	5091560	It's like there's can that would be even better.
5091660	5092960	Holy shit.
5093260	5094160	Holy shit.
5094260	5095660	Cut that out of the podcast.
5095660	5096660	That's actually a good picture.
5096760	5097560	That's a great.
5097560	5100260	It's a great everything to the triggered pinata.
5101060	5102060	Don't hit me work.
5102560	5106260	That's a horrible thing that you think like if a sentient
5106260	5110860	thing was saying stop hitting me that that would want you
5111260	5113160	make you want to hit it more.
5113160	5113460	Yeah.
5113460	5115660	And what if you bleed also and cry?
5116060	5119460	Holy shit, like if sheep could scream, yeah, when you kill
5119460	5122660	them and they had an idea that you were making sweaters
5123160	5130860	and they were just like we could do we do we do we I'm
5130860	5131660	down to do it.
5131660	5133760	I just wanted to tell that story that I had earlier.
5133760	5136860	That's the only reason why I know it's a crazy.
5136860	5139160	It doesn't come up to want you to I honestly have to say I
5139160	5142460	do want you to stand strong on the way you feel about
5142460	5147660	Hamilton because I do think that even Lin-Manuel understands
5147660	5148560	how you feel.
5148860	5151760	He's he's a you know, he's a fan of rap, but I also think
5151760	5154760	he understands that what he's doing is sanitized rap, but
5154760	5156060	what is very clever.
5156060	5156660	Very awesome.
5156660	5157960	Did you see my tweets?
5158760	5160060	What were you talking about?
5160560	5161360	Not knocking him.
5161560	5163760	Yeah, but what were your tweets?
5164160	5165060	No, I don't want to talk.
5165060	5166960	I don't you know, I talk about it.
5167360	5168060	Okay.
5168260	5171660	Yeah, I mean more like Crapleton.
5174160	5176860	Why didn't someone give this guy a manual?
5176860	5179260	I said how to rap better.
5179260	5184160	I said was if you drop a C because this is some crap music
5184260	5186960	I'm listening to and it just says rap.
5187560	5191360	So I think you might have left to see somewhere often off
5191360	5192460	the word pretty good.
5192460	5193760	Welcome to our ool.
5193760	5194060	Notice.
5194060	5194860	There's no pee in it.
5194860	5196160	Let's keep it that way.
5196260	5199460	I don't know if that was a warning to him just from your
5199460	5200660	experience as a camp counselor.
5200660	5202460	I'm sure he was surprised because when you look at you,
5202460	5202860	you go.
5202860	5204760	Well, this guy loves rap.
5204860	5208460	This guy is a big rap fanatic looks like old boy.
5208460	5209360	What are you looking about?
5209360	5211460	Look like I'm action Bronson over here.
5211460	5213860	No, well, the old dirty bastard.
5213960	5215560	No, the Godfather.
5216460	5217260	Mario Poots.
5217260	5218260	Oh, I know Jesus.
5218260	5218660	Marl.
5218660	5219160	You guys.
5219160	5219860	Mario Poots.
5219860	5222560	You know, I'm talking about who am I talking about?
5223260	5224560	No, God damn it.
5225060	5228560	The Godfather from the other part of Run DMC the people the
5228560	5231360	person we never ever see Jazzy Jeff.
5231960	5232460	Kindle.
5232460	5232960	Let's go.
5232960	5234960	And I'll let's see.
5234960	5235960	Candles.
5236760	5236960	K.
5236960	5237660	Dole.
5237960	5240160	Why can I make a name?
5240260	5242260	I mean, I'm sure people like it.
5242760	5246260	I just the rap seemed to be off meter and it's like there
5246260	5246760	are apps.
5246760	5249660	It needs to be like the meter is all there is in rap.
5249760	5252760	And so if you're like I have a banana and my friends from
5252760	5256160	Panama then it's like well that doesn't really I mean sure
5256260	5257260	it's great for a music.
5257260	5258260	I agree to disagree.
5258660	5259660	No, I'm gonna I'm gonna agree.
5259660	5261160	That's the that is the issue is that it is.
5261360	5262060	Efficient.
5262160	5263160	It is clever.
5263260	5264160	It is what you're saying.
5264160	5266160	It's very highly tuned to it which is impressive.
5266260	5272860	And it is a wonderful piece, but rap maybe not poetry.
5272860	5273760	Sure poetry.
5273760	5274160	Sure.
5274660	5281160	I like the the British Kingdom singing to America.
5281560	5284760	You'll be back like that part.
5285560	5286160	They were right.
5287060	5288260	Rick Rubin.
5288260	5288860	God damn.
5288860	5289560	That was killing me.
5289560	5290160	This motherfucker.
5290360	5293760	When Rick Rubin said yes, it's fucking great.
5295560	5296060	I like it.
5299860	5303560	I like it when Hamilton's mom does the song you're talking
5303560	5304060	about it.
5307560	5309560	This is pretty stupid.
5309560	5310060	They're there.
5310060	5312360	They say well, I make more money than you ever will.
5313460	5314560	You're talking about it.
5315360	5316460	That means it's good.
5317360	5320860	If a billboard gets your attention, it's doing what it should.
5320860	5324060	Don't complain about graphic design.
5324060	5326460	You're a kid from Milwaukee and you're all mine.
5326560	5331460	I birthed you out of my vagina and I will make you mediocre
5331460	5335060	if I can like the mom and pink Floyd's the wall.
5335060	5336560	I'll suffocate you with my arms.
5336760	5341560	I love mitigating.
5341560	5346760	I have titties grating.
5346760	5348760	I don't know what I was grating.
5352060	5353460	I guess I like Hamilton now.

5484260	5486260	I shot some person.
5486260	5488260	Was that that thing you were talking about?
5488260	5490260	No, all that was the week before.
5490260	5492260	It was a bunch of stuff the week before.
5492260	5496260	But then today, my friends Kyle Duck and Graham and Molly Evan
5496260	5498260	had a crab, a crawfish boil.
5498260	5499260	Yeah.
5499260	5500260	It was just mountains.
5500260	5501260	I was at one of those recently.
5501260	5503260	Dude, just corn and sausage and crawdads.
5503260	5504260	So violent.
5504260	5506260	What?
5506260	5508260	Like dismembering crabs?
5508260	5511760	I went to one a couple weeks ago with my buddy Scott.
5511760	5513760	Shellfish?
5513760	5515760	Yeah, they all get chipped in live.
5515760	5516760	No, I know what they are.
5516760	5517760	From Louisiana.
5517760	5518760	They have to be alive.
5518760	5520760	I'm just saying, shellfish?
5520760	5523760	Yeah, but when you see the devastation...
5523760	5524760	Okay, that's cool.
5524760	5527760	You know, they're all alive in a bag.
5527760	5529760	Cut open the bag, they put it.
5529760	5532760	Then they dump all these living creatures in a strainer.
5532760	5533760	Look, I know.
5533760	5534760	But I'm witnessing it, okay?
5534760	5535760	That's why.
5535760	5537760	What do you mean, look, I know.
5537760	5538760	What do you mean?
5538760	5539760	I know.
5539760	5540760	I know.
5540760	5541760	You're on my team.
5541760	5542760	Thank you.
5542760	5543760	Yeah, Rob.
5543760	5544760	Remember, you're on his team.
5544760	5545760	Oh, boy.
5545760	5546760	I hear Spencer and Dan.
5546760	5548760	But anyway, they're all freaking out.
5548760	5550760	They're trying to get out, climb out of this thing.
5550760	5552760	Why do you think they're trying to get out?
5552760	5554760	They don't want to be on top of each other.
5554760	5555760	Why?
5555760	5556760	Jesus.
5556760	5557760	Why do you think they're trying to get out?
5557760	5558760	I don't know, Rob.
5558760	5559760	I don't know.
5559760	5560760	They think they're on the same team.
5560760	5563760	Is it because they can't wait for Cajun season and spice in?
5563760	5564760	Yeah.
5564760	5565760	Is it because they...
5565760	5566760	They're happy?
5566760	5570760	There's like a hundred of them in there all moving around, but it's like bodies stacked
5570760	5576760	up, and then they get put in a pot of boiling water, and then they get covered, and then
5576760	5577760	10 minutes...
5577760	5578760	They're not alone.
5578760	5579760	Corn?
5579760	5582760	Yeah, there's corn in there, so they have the corn to talk to.
5582760	5583760	Oh, there's corn!
5583760	5584760	Lemon slices.
5584760	5585760	Oh, if it's corn, they didn't feel anything.
5585760	5586760	Calm down, Rob.
5586760	5589760	If there's corn and butter, they didn't feel anything.
5589760	5590760	They didn't feel anything.
5591760	5598360	10 minutes later, they take the strainer out, and then they just dump like a hundred corpses
5598360	5601760	on this table, and there's all these people...
5601760	5603760	It's like Cormac McCarthy Jr.
5603760	5604760	They just pull...
5604760	5606760	Slow down and hold the head.
5606760	5610760	They pull them in half, and then they eat what looks like...
5610760	5611760	Inside.
5611760	5614760	The diet, the shit track.
5614760	5615760	It's like brown.
5615760	5616760	It looks like...
5616760	5619760	This is how Vonnegut would describe a picnic.
5619760	5620760	At Roy Rogers.
5620760	5624760	Yeah, and then at the end, you look at the devastation.
5624760	5628760	It's like less than an inch of meat in that thing, and I can't imagine...
5628760	5629760	It didn't smell good.
5629760	5633760	And then it's just like hundreds of corpses on this table.
5633760	5635760	Are you doing this at the crab boil?
5635760	5636760	Are you there saying this?
5636760	5637760	Yeah, because I'm like...
5637760	5638760	Soil and green!
5638760	5641760	It's a lot of death.
5641760	5643760	Hey, everybody, check on...
5643760	5644760	Stop it!
5644760	5645760	Stop it!
5645760	5648760	Just try to have a good time, and it tastes good.
5648760	5649760	No, they were like...
5649760	5652760	This tastes good.
5652760	5656760	Stop being such a bummer, Steve.
5656760	5657760	Yeah.
5657760	5660760	I think it tastes good.
5660760	5662760	I was just like...
5662760	5663760	Jeez.
5663760	5664760	I'm so unlikable.
5664760	5666760	I'm doing nothing for my cause.
5666760	5667760	No, it's an important tool.
5667760	5668760	Yeah, it's an important tool.
5668760	5669760	It's good.
5669760	5670760	You just beat yourself.
5670760	5672760	I tried not to say anything at all.
5672760	5673760	No, no, no.
5673760	5677760	It's a ridiculous thing that we still do that, because it's not a lot of meat.
5677760	5678760	Things with a lot of meat, maybe.
5678760	5679760	It's not a shrimp.
5679760	5681760	A shrimp, the whole thing is the meat.
5681760	5684760	But even a shrimp is kind of a small piece of meat.
5684760	5686760	It's the largest birthday.
5686760	5687760	Yeah, let it be crabs.
5687760	5688760	Oh, no, no.
5688760	5689760	Yeah, I'm sorry.
5689760	5690760	I'm sorry.
5690760	5691760	It was a fun party.
5691760	5692760	It was a fun party.
5692760	5694760	I don't know why I'm looking at you when I said the door was closed.
5694760	5695760	Because you know we know.
5695760	5696760	A hammer.
5696760	5698760	A waffle house.
5698760	5699760	Waffle house?
5699760	5700760	Waffle house?
5700760	5701760	Waffle house.
5701760	5704760	This is a good waffle house.
5704760	5705760	Waffle house.
5705760	5706760	Waffle house.
5707760	5714760	Yeah, well, on top of you guys being black gentlemen, we're listening to the one Jewish
5714760	5717760	guy is telling us that shellfish are gross.
5717760	5719760	We knew you felt that way.
5719760	5721760	You can go to hell when you eat one.
5721760	5722760	It wasn't shellfish.
5722760	5727760	It was like I had seen pictures of Jews piled up like that before.
5727760	5729760	Oh, God, Jesus in heaven.
5729760	5731760	I have two, yeah.
5731760	5732760	Fuck me up, man.
5732760	5735760	I think the Nazis were going, would you taste good?
5736760	5737760	Oh, God.
5737760	5738760	Damn.
5738760	5739760	It's worth it.
5739760	5740760	Damn.
5740760	5741760	It tastes good.
5741760	5742760	That's a good point, Rob.
5742760	5746760	The Nazis were more moral than people who eat shellfish.
5746760	5748760	Wow, bro.
5748760	5749760	More moral?
5749760	5754760	The Holocaust was basically a clam bake, is what you're saying.
5754760	5761400	Well, I'm sure the Nazis had to think that the Jews were animals in order to do horrible
5761400	5762400	things to them, right?
5762400	5763400	No, that's true.
5763400	5764400	Okay.
5764400	5765400	Or did they thought they were humans in equals?
5765400	5766400	No.
5767400	5768400	They had to turn them mentally.
5768400	5773400	They had to process that they were less than them in order to do horrible things to them.
5773400	5781400	Well, I'm never going to tell you that you shouldn't be a vegetarian and invest in peace.
5781400	5782400	I will.
5782400	5783400	Stop it.
5783400	5784400	Knock it off.
5784400	5785400	Birthday weekend.
5785400	5786400	Thank you.
5786400	5789400	So what else happened in this birthday weekend for you?
5789400	5790400	Anything else?
5790400	5792400	Oh, that's a big event.
5792400	5794400	That's fair enough.
5794400	5796400	That's a good move for her.
5796400	5797400	And do you celebrate?
5797400	5798400	Do you go all out?
5798400	5800400	The Friday party was great.
5800400	5801400	Yeah.
5801400	5802400	A little joy.
5802400	5805400	Just a dance party with Ricky Carmona and DJ Moist.
5805400	5806400	Ricky.
5806400	5807400	Yeah.
5807400	5808400	DJ Moist.
5808400	5810400	Playing the best hip-hop new jack swing.
5810400	5811400	And did you guys have the back room?
5811400	5812400	Yeah, we had the whole back room.
5812400	5817400	The best part was the main Friday night's a big dance night in that bar, the little joy.
5817400	5818400	Okay.
5818400	5822400	And the main DJ was there doing whatever he wanted.
5822400	5825400	He was playing like world, like Brazil, Brazil beat.
5825400	5826400	Of course.
5826400	5830400	And everybody that was coming in was going, what's going on in there?
5830400	5832400	And we're just coming into the room, the little room for the party.
5832400	5833400	So we were stacked up.
5833400	5834400	Awesome.
5834400	5835400	People were on the...
5835400	5836400	I missed it.
5836400	5840400	At some point, the DJ, the main DJ is just in our party, just standing around with his
5840400	5841400	arms crossed going, why is this?
5841400	5844400	And when I went out to talk to him, there was nobody in the front room.
5844400	5845400	Everybody was just in our...
5845400	5846400	Awesome.
5846400	5847400	So it was good.
5847400	5851400	You want to hear what I hear in my head when I hear new jack swing as a genre, like what
5851400	5852400	it sounds like?
5852400	5853400	Oh, I'm sure it does.
5853400	5854400	Yeah.
5854400	5855400	I got my baby on a fire escape.
5855400	5861400	I'm going to make love to her tonight and I got two panties in a bucket of dreams for
5861400	5862400	me.
5862400	5863400	Wow.
5863400	5864400	Wow.
5864400	5865400	Wow.
5865400	5868400	I didn't really add enough new jack to that, but also it wasn't swing.
5868400	5870400	You feel like you're a little swing?
5870400	5872400	Yeah, swing and a miss across the board.
5872400	5873400	All right.
5873400	5874400	Well, happy birthday.
5874400	5875400	Thanks, man.
5875400	5880400	I'm trying to think of like wordplay to do with your name and birthday or like, are you
5880400	5882400	going to turn into a mortgage?
5882400	5883400	I'm sorry.
5883400	5884400	I bummed you out on your birthday.
5884400	5887400	I mean, I don't know.
5887400	5893560	I don't know how, when, how did, I mean, it's so easy for people to protest something like
5893560	5898160	guns or, or, or like political stuff, but I don't know how to do it.
5898160	5899920	And I, I'm making it.
5899920	5908560	I thought you made a salient point, but it just makes the people dig in more with what
5908560	5909560	they want to do.
5909560	5913480	Well, maybe if they're, maybe if they're 30 or maybe if they're, they, they don't,
5913480	5923800	I mean, I think we're all reasonably mature, if not aging, decrepit, world weary men that,
5923800	5925800	that are perfectly willing to have something.
5925800	5926800	You know what it is?
5926800	5933120	It's guilt for living a certain way and then, and waking up and going, Oh my God, what have
5933120	5934120	I been doing?
5934120	5939120	If we didn't have friends that went there, we wouldn't, I mean, part of the, part of
5939800	5949440	the very profound crime of a carnivorous lifestyle is that it's truly mainstream to the point
5949440	5951720	where no one ever has to talk about it.
5951720	5958320	So much as like gay rights or anything, it's like, like, like, like there's the oppression
5958320	5962080	is sounds like silence, you know, like, like no one talking about it at all.
5962080	5966320	So what are you supposed to do except say stuff and yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's
5966320	5972120	a not, it's an unenviable position to be the person that brings it up because the incentive
5972120	5975520	would be to not do that because, Oh, I want people to like me, which is like saying it
5975520	5976520	tastes good.
5976520	5977520	Yeah.
5977520	5978520	And we try to strike a balance.
5978520	5983120	I think, I think I like that I have a friend who represents that view and I perceive myself
5983120	5988440	as hovering around that, you know, Kevin Smith told me he, he went vegetarian cause he or
5988440	5992920	vegan cause he just had his heart attack and you know, it, it, and everybody's like all
5992920	5994120	mad at him.
5994120	5999360	You know, like, like, like, like some kind of lifestyle or something like that.
5999360	6000360	He's just like, what?
6000360	6004680	I can't eat meat for four years and then have a heart attack and then stop eating.
6004680	6005680	I used to do that too.
6005680	6010400	I used to love Korean barbecue and I remember I, our, our, our good friend Kelsey Abbott
6010400	6011400	is vegetarian.
6011400	6014240	I said, Hey, we're going to go do Korean barbecue.
6014240	6015440	It's, it's great.
6015440	6018160	You know, come along cause you're fun and it's always fun.
6018160	6020800	And I'd like you to, and she said, Koreans are human beings.
6020800	6027600	It's not really, but, but she was like, um, I don't really, you know, she was trying to
6027600	6028600	be cool about it.
6028600	6030120	And I went, Oh God.
6030120	6031880	And I made her feel bad about it.
6031880	6036360	And I now, I guess you felt bad because that's, that's why it's important to, to, to speak
6036360	6037360	out.
6037360	6038360	I don't know.
6038360	6041760	It's a corny phrase speak out, but it's the reason, the reason why it's good and healthy
6041760	6047340	for you to say stuff is the same reason why people might like smack you down.
6047340	6052220	When I was a smoker, same thing, smoker culture, somebody says you should quit smoking.
6052220	6056260	You know, we make fun of the non-smokers telling it, trying to help us because we, I don't
6056260	6060060	know, we were drawn to these cigarettes as a part of a religion that we're like, yeah,
6060060	6061060	go fuck yourself.
6061060	6062060	My drinking.
6062060	6065300	I don't like, I don't like, uh, I don't like people being sanctimonious and telling me,
6065300	6070380	but you know, if I was truly confident and blah, blah, blah, like I should, I should
6070380	6072220	let it just be part of my world.
6072220	6076740	If I know that I love drinking and I, and I know why or whatever, and I don't have a
6076740	6079660	single inkling of like, oh, maybe I should quit drinking.
6079660	6085260	Then I wouldn't upset me when a 16 year old twit, um, whose life is untested and who has
6085260	6087100	never tasted real pain.
6087100	6093820	Um, uh, uh, you know, every time I self-effacingly comment on my trademark, uh, boozing, you
6093820	6100020	know, humorlessly suggests that I sh that I'm an unhappy person or a blah, blah, blah.
6100020	6104420	I'm like, no, you're a transparently joyless little fucking mongrel.
6104420	6109980	Like you're, you're, you're a broke petty judgmental little shit face and you're talking
6109980	6111940	to a middle aged millionaire.
6111940	6119920	I, I, I, am I allowed to self-abuse, uh, I'm, I'm 30 years ahead of you, uh, uh, I'll figure
6119920	6120920	it out.
6120920	6125100	I'm probably going to like learn more shit before you because I'm old.
6125100	6126100	I'm dying.

6189780	6191780	No segue.
6191780	6195540	I keep saying, like, we should, we should shorten the episodes by like five minutes
6195540	6197700	a week until they're like 90 minutes.
6197700	6200580	And then like, cause why, why does he do, why would anyone want to listen to this for
6200580	6201580	two hours?
6201580	6202580	We have a couple of announcements.
6202580	6203580	Oh, okay.

6209340	6216020	That's a, that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a, well, he probably could go to
6216020	6217020	Boston.
6217020	6218020	Yeah.
6218020	6219020	Boston and then Long Island the next day.
6219020	6221660	I mean, most adults are free to travel around the country.
6221660	6222660	Right.
6222660	6223660	Yeah.
6223660	6227420	That's do you have your guests lined up already for Boston and other secrets?
6227420	6229540	We usually don't do guests on the road.
6229540	6230540	Not usually.
6230540	6231540	Right.
6231540	6232540	Sometimes.
6232540	6233540	Is that Galifianac has made drop by?
6233540	6234540	Yeah.
6234540	6235540	No, I'm kidding.
6235540	6236540	I say, yeah, you can find tickets for that.
6236540	6237540	I don't know why that was funny.
6237540	6238540	It's funny to trick people.
6238540	6239540	Yeah.
6239540	6246980	Uh, the Wilbur theater, I hear we're almost sold out almost get them over a thousand seats
6246980	6260260	well, that's real good news also Long Island, uh, another big announcement, uh, uh, we're
6260260	6268340	very close to closing a deal, um, where we will have an audience again, June 4th.
6268340	6273860	Also if, I mean, don't, don't know if you care about announcing this, but we're switching
6273860	6274860	nights.
6274860	6276940	Oh, we'll probably switch nights to Saturdays.
6276940	6284860	Switch nights to Monday, Monday night when the action is hot, you go to work after Sunday,
6284860	6285860	you're miserable.
6285860	6293100	And Monday night, it's Tuesday Eve, ready to action, ready to party Monday night.
6293100	6295380	The M is for marvelous.
6295380	6300620	Oh, um, what does the N stand for?
6300620	6301620	Nice.
6301620	6305300	Nut sauce, blue apron, nut sauce.
6305300	6308180	But uh, what we used to be on Mondays, right?
6308180	6309180	Or was it Tuesdays?
6309180	6313180	It was Monday's back in the day and then we went to Sunday and now our, it's like a home
6313180	6314180	company.
6314180	6316500	I mean, we can always, we would always have the option of like, like, well, maybe not
6316500	6322380	at this new place, but like, uh, obviously here, uh, we could be here anytime we wanted.
6322380	6324420	We could be here at 3 AM on Friday.
6324420	6331340	Uh, well we prerecord these, but, but somebody told me that Saturdays and Fridays are like
6331340	6335260	bad nights for comedy in terms of live audiences.
6335260	6336260	Fridays are great.
6336260	6337260	Fridays are rough.
6337260	6338260	Okay.
6338260	6339260	Why?
6339260	6340260	Because of, because people are tired.
6340260	6344500	So you, the, the myth is Friday second show is the worst show you'll do all night, all
6344500	6345500	week.
6345500	6346500	Cause Pete, cause who's tired?
6346500	6347500	It's Friday night.
6347500	6348500	Cause you're tired of work.
6348500	6349500	Yeah.
6349500	6352780	That's why the groundlings, the groundling second show is always either cooking with
6352780	6355180	gas or the new shows that the new sketches are trying out.
6355180	6356180	And then they.
6356180	6357180	Yeah.
6357180	6360540	And even at every comedy show in the city is going to be like fucking Friday second
6360540	6361540	shows.
6361540	6362540	The worst.
6362540	6364500	They're really drunk by then usually too.
6364500	6368220	So if you jump in your car and you come straight to the comedy show, great.
6368220	6371540	But if you are at home pre-parting and then you show up at the comedy show, you're like,
6371540	6372980	fuck this place.
6372980	6375380	Both shows Saturday are wonderful cause people put it in their plans.
6375380	6376380	They know they're doing it.
6376380	6377380	Yeah.
6377380	6380060	And they sleep in and then they, then your Saturday is okay.
6380060	6381060	I get it.
6381060	6385900	But anyways, Monday nights, come on hottest night of the week, you've had two days to
6385900	6386900	get rested.
6386900	6388900	Are you still fucked up?
6388900	6396380	You had your breakfast, you had your lunch, you had your dinner.
6396380	6401140	You've had all day to like re-engage your career.
6401140	6404620	You can also tell like, I don't want to do shit this week by Monday.
6404620	6408060	So go out Monday night and prove it.
6408060	6411660	So anyways, yeah, we're going to be where we will have audiences back and all this stuff.
6411660	6413380	Like, like again, how do they get tickets?
6413380	6414380	Look, I know.
6414380	6415380	I'm sorry.
6415380	6419420	It never, it mistook me for thinking that there was a better idea to not have an audience
6419420	6422860	that was never, I didn't, I never thought that that made the show better.
6422860	6430180	I think what I may have, who told, who said, like I told a bunch of people that I don't
6430180	6434980	know if you've been languishing in silence going like, oh, Dan thinks this is a great
6434980	6437520	idea to not be in front of an audience.
6437520	6438520	Not really.
6438520	6443320	No, I don't really think it's a good experiment because I found it beneficial to me.
6443320	6444740	I enjoyed it.
6444740	6446460	I found the good in it.
6446460	6448780	And now it's run its course and you're ready to go back.
6448780	6451020	I bet you're going to be a better person.
6451020	6453620	I'm going to be like a fucking LeBron.
6453620	6454700	Oh, great.
6454700	6464620	You could be like a LeBron, you're going to be like LeBron, this brown taking it to Korea
6464620	6465620	town.
6465620	6477820	Are we allowed to say where we're going to be doing, where are we going to be?
6477820	6478820	I just said it.
6478820	6482220	I will wait until I get the green light.
6482220	6483220	Okay.
6483220	6484220	What else is there?
6484220	6487140	You aren't going to believe it, kids.
6487140	6493460	The Jeffrey Dahmer, uh, amusementarium, uh, here's, here's something, here's something.
6493460	6502180	The green light, the original green light blue, no, come on, no, when they brought them
6502180	6510580	spoons down, that's a reference to, to every YouTube sketch.
6510580	6511580	Just for you.
6511580	6512580	Wait.
6512580	6515380	Oh, I was going to ask you, by the way, speaking of that, when you said Ashton Kuchner, were
6515380	6519940	you doing a reference to that guy from the reality show where the, you know, it's, it's,
6519940	6520940	isn't it just Kuchner?
6520940	6521940	Yeah.
6521940	6527700	But the guy, I love, I love New York, remember when New York did her spin off of the flavor
6527700	6528700	flavor show?
6528700	6535980	There was a guy, it was like kind of a meme that this guy's like, the gay, uh, Asian,
6535980	6539260	like Butler guy, or not Asian, I think he was Hispanic.
6539260	6540260	It doesn't matter.
6540260	6541260	Race doesn't matter.
6541260	6542260	Um, it matters.
6542260	6543380	He was, he was not white.
6543380	6544380	That's all that matters.
6544380	6545380	That's all that ever matters.
6545820	6550020	And he comes, he comes out and he, he's just very flamboyant.
6550020	6554180	And then they cut to one of the contestants on the show and gone like, man, when he came
6554180	6556980	out, I was like, all right, what am I being punked?
6556980	6558980	Where's Ashton Kuchner?
6558980	6566100	Anyways, I thought you were doing like a reference to that Kuchner.
6566100	6569940	It's the funniest unnecessary in the history of celebrity names.
6569940	6574820	It's like a, a, a, a term for the vajaz.
6574820	6575820	Yeah.
6575820	6579420	I'm going to put it in your Kuchner.
6579420	6583780	I'm going to give it to you all night to the break of dawn.
6583780	6590340	I will love you slowly and consistently.
6590340	6601380	I want to sweat to the break of dawn sexually with you and making love to the dawn time
6601380	6602860	in a mattress.
6602860	6605800	Our bodies are going to entangle.
6605800	6608780	My penis will be inside.
6608780	6610180	You'll like it.
6610180	6611780	You'll say good.
6611780	6612780	Thank you.
6612780	6620260	I'll say you're welcome to the break of dawn in your booty and your body and your vagina
6620260	6623460	and your Kuchner with your knees and your feet.
6623460	6625980	I'm turned on by every part of you.
6625980	6627180	I'll fuck your ear.
6627180	6629420	I'll use your hair to jerk off.
6629420	6632980	I'll sit on top of you and eat pizza.
6632980	6641180	I will watch you clip your toenails to the break of dawn in your booty and your life
6641180	6642340	and your soul.
6642340	6646740	I'm going to take you downtown to my sex place.
6646740	6649860	Oh, okay.
6649860	6650860	You have your own sex place.
6650860	6651860	Yeah.
6651860	6653460	Well, I mean, it's a metaphorical sex place.
6653460	6656020	I mean, it's state of mind where I get down.
6656020	6659180	The break of dawn is a real reference to a time.
6659180	6663060	It's the earliest morning that still counts as day.
6663060	6666980	I just don't like fucking you unless it's nighttime.
6666980	6671740	So the break of dawn is unfortunately when I have to stop.
6671740	6674340	It's not because I don't want to keep doing it.
6674340	6676700	It's because I'm a sexual vampire.
6676700	6680980	I don't like doing it after the break of dawn.
6680980	6683460	Daytime and sex don't mix.
6683460	6685780	So I'll fuck you to the break of dawn.
6685780	6686780	That's it.
6686780	6694420	And then we'll make plans to get together at sunset and to keep doing it with your body
6694420	6699580	in the break of dawn to the break of dawn, et cetera.
6699580	6700580	That's it.
6700580	6702580	Yeah, that was 10 minutes, right?
6702580	6703580	10 minutes.
6703580	6704580	Okay.
6704580	6705580	10 minutes.
6705580	6706580	How about a beat?
6706620	6708620	Because we just, okay.
6708620	6715700	Now you're just talking about, so just redo it to the break of dawn all night long.
6715700	6723140	I'm going to have sex with you with my dog, put it in your, I'm going to insert myself
6723140	6728820	inside of you for the purpose of reproduction, but it's going to be pleasurable.
6728820	6731260	I hope we don't make a baby too soon.
6731260	6732260	It's fun.
6732260	6737380	If we do, it's okay though, because I love you to the break of dawn, to the break of
6737380	6738380	dawn.
6738380	6740100	I'm going to fuck you all night long.
6740100	6746260	My penis, your vagina, these things in North Carolina, our sex could not be fine.
6746260	6759380	I'm going to eat you out like China, or energy, Japanese, yo, I'm fucked to the break of dawn.
6759380	6761260	I'm doing it on the front lawn.
6761260	6765860	I've often rhymed those words in the song with, my name is MC John.
6765860	6767860	I'm doing it at the sunrise.
6767860	6769860	I'm fucking your feet and your mouth and your thighs.
6769860	6773940	I'm going to put mayonnaise on your face, and then I'm going to go into outer space
6773940	6777900	and put my penis in a car, drive around the sun.
6777900	6780900	It's a star made of hydrogen burned so brightly.
6780900	6783180	I fucked your mom like I was Keira Knightley.
6783180	6788940	I did the scissor thing on a pirate ship.
6788940	6795740	I was born on a pirate ship, if you hold your tongue, it sounds like pile of shit.
6795740	6800500	You can trick people into saying it on the playground in 1976.
6800500	6806900	I pee pee in your coke, I fuck your mom like the smoke of a wheel with a baseball card.
6806900	6811220	I fucked your mama not too hard, I did it soft, real gentle.
6811220	6818860	I fucked your mom like I was mental, I went, oh, oh, oh, it wasn't offensive, my sister
6818860	6824380	is retarded, I fucked your mom so hard, I farted, I floated up in the air, fucked your
6824380	6829820	mama, then I sat in a chair, watched her sleep for an hour, got back on top of her Eiffel
6829820	6832900	Tower is what I call the position that I did.
6832900	6843780	It's just me, hidden on the foot of the bed, being French and watching all that I see.
6843780	6850420	I see beautiful women that deserve to be equal, I love the way they vote, I'd like
6850420	6856340	to give them maternity leave, but then I'd like to make love to them to the break of
6856340	6863940	dawn, to the break of dawn, women should be equal, but let's also make love.
6863940	6875780	Home, I have no home, the jungle is my home, what does he say, is he a famous professor
6875780	6885420	doing a lecture, is that something that sounds like, hunted, despised, treated like an animal,
6885420	6893020	long, long to the break of dawn, treated like an animal, do it in your booty, like fruity
6893020	6901020	tooty, just a bite, Ray Moody, Roy Moody, who's the politician named Moody, what was
6901020	6908580	his name, fucked your mama, felt no shame, I'm proud of my fucking, I liked her duckin,
6908580	6920340	I do pussy pluckin, but you can also be hairy, I wanna make love to you to the break of dawn,
6920340	6922540	take it to mortgage.
6922540	6928100	What we have seen here is an example of styling and profiling, on the right you have Dan Harmon,
6928100	6933580	an intellectual and a wordsmith, on the left Robert Shrav, a professor of some repute,
6933580	6941340	published yes, honored yes, lurid also, what we're trying to do is bring to you a representation
6941340	6946700	of what the break of dawn means, how do you take a dawn and break it, do you grasp it
6946700	6952220	in both hands and rip it apart, do you caress it until it opens gently for you, do you punch
6952220	6957860	it in the fucking face until it cracks, fractures, and after having done such a thing where do
6957860	6962700	you pour the ingredients, do you pour them all over your body or all over the floor,
6962700	6968900	the dawn is an interesting time, it happens in the morning, it happens every day, wait
6968900	6974620	for yourself, if you fuck it up tomorrow, you'll always have Wednesday.
6974620	6979900	All right, ladies and gentlemen, that is Harmontown.
6979900	6981580	Do you have a list of people that you think?
6981580	6985580	I do have a list of people that I think, I start with Sarah Hill, I work my way over
