0	20880	It's a beautiful uptown Burbank Harbinetown is now in session.
20880	31720	Spencer Crittenden He's a man with a plaid pillow because he
31720	37400	probably has hemorrhoids And the mayor of Harbinetown, Mr. Dan Harbin
37400	49120	Thank you, thank you very much, thank you for coming out, happy summer, happy Burbank
49120	50120	to you.
50120	52240	Do you need a better chair?
52240	53760	We could get you a chair.
53760	55360	Yeah, eventually sure.
55360	59360	Let's put that on a vision board.
59360	61680	Are you getting sore buns over there on your plastic chair?
61680	63120	I have in the past.
63120	64700	I figured it out.
64700	69640	You know these plaid pillows we got them from from Harminquest season two tapings.
69640	77880	They were bought as mostly I think a joke by the people who furnished the green rooms
77880	84640	and then they just gave it to me afterwards because they only bought them as a joke.
84640	87280	You mad that they came out of the budget for your show?
87280	90160	Yeah, it's really wasteful in my opinion.
90160	94720	No, no, it was great, but it's just great that I really can use it like because it's
94720	98040	like you know and then I was like great now I have these pillows I don't really have anywhere
98040	99040	to put them.
99040	102280	Why not put them on my ass?
102280	106760	In the 80s, especially in animation, there was a heavy tradition of characters that could
106760	111320	turn into other things and then they would like they would have like they would keep
111320	114880	their motif if they turned into something like plastic man could turn into anything
114880	120760	but he always had this belt and a little outfit but that would be stretched around the middle
120760	124640	of the car and there was Rubik the Amazing Cube who could turn into things but he always
124640	131440	had this weird blue decaying ET head because someone said well it's just a Rubik's Cube
131440	137920	we have to make it adorable and they put this fucking weird ET head on it like mistaking
137920	145680	just any alien head for cute and it was really disturbing and not at all Rubik-oriented and
145680	150360	really drifted from Rubik's original vision.
150360	154880	People only know him for his Cube but he saw a world of order.
154880	156920	He never intended people to mess those things up.
156920	158880	He wanted to, he was racist.
158880	165160	The original Rubik's Cube was all white.
165160	173440	But he married a wonderful Latina lady and as a result he became a little less racist
173440	177600	in that he was like oh all let's make this cube like six different colors but still like
177600	183000	so into like the separation of them and he credited himself with being more open-minded
183000	188800	but yeah but the goal is to separate all the races and that was the slogan at the end of
188800	194600	the commercials he would pop up on the bottom of the screen and go don't forget to separate
194600	198200	all the races.
198200	204680	It's a separate but equal exclamation point on the box and he thought he just thought
204680	209280	he wasn't racist and because that's what white people are good at they're good at fooling
209280	213040	themselves into thinking that all kinds of racism is not racist.
213040	217420	It's in our blood we were good at it.
217420	220900	It's also Harman Town's motto I think.
220900	222420	Separate those races.
222420	228940	The point that you were going at is that Spencer brings on a plaid pillow that's his like that's
228940	232700	what he turns into because if Spencer turned into a pillow that's what it would look like
232700	236420	yeah it would be this plaid pillow oh man and have glasses and a beard on it.
236420	240460	That would be so good that would be great if we were like the super friends and we're
240460	245300	just like hanging out and like turning into pillows and stuff yeah oh it would be like
245300	256180	Steven Universe yeah yeah Dan would turn you would turn into an Adderall yeah I didn't
256180	264420	I mean I didn't know this this bit was an opportunity to take shots at each other you
264420	268140	would turn into an old-timey typewriter I think you would turn into like you'd be like
268140	273260	a little little typewriter like on wheels yeah we're talking about characters that could
273260	277300	turn into anything like like that's why they have to retain those physical characteristics
277300	281700	because and and the super friends is another one you had the wonder twins what they would
281700	285620	say wonder twin powers activate and then one of them could turn into any animal and one
285620	289980	of them could turn into any kind of thing that involved water which included ice and
289980	295160	a bucket to hold the water which did that's that always guy wait I can turn into other
295160	301620	things beside water yeah yeah and at one point I swear to God well he I mean at one point
301620	306540	he turned into an ice giant and it was like all right well wait a minute and I was like
306540	309780	why don't you turn into a Superman which I can't remember now I can't remember if he
309780	314980	did that or if that was in my just bitchings about it an ice giant wait what does he have
314980	319100	ice arteries and ice heart like well then just be what so ice is just anything then
319100	327700	fuck you yeah I think he was like a form of an ice helicopter yeah like silly is moving
327700	335660	parts to stop it where is the verisimilitude wonder twins yeah yeah that's my I know we've
335660	339140	talked about this before because whenever super friends comes up the thing that I think
339140	344420	is so funny is that there was a there was obviously a push for diversity 70s style in
344420	348940	the for that cartoon and they added this guy who I can't remember the superheroes name
348940	356780	was it El Diablo or El Dorado he was a Latino gentleman and but he like I never saw him
356860	361700	in the cartoon like I just saw they just had him in the title sequence to just like maybe
361700	365940	there was like protests happening outside of the super friends building where they draw
365940	372340	the cartoon and they're just like shut up his name is El Dorado but and Caesar Chavez
372340	375900	is holding great protests right now on the streets we got to get some Mexicans on this
375900	381100	in the in the in the title sequence El Dorado has a medallion and he's like a handsome kind
381100	387660	of a darkly complected man and he just has this red cape and he and he just whips it
387660	398380	over his face and disappears you never see him in the show that was the diversity he's
398380	404980	invisible but he's always there he supports the the super friends community with his he
404980	409180	works he works for last and he's there was that time when the wonder twins were walking
409180	415740	down a beach and there was six set of footprints that's how you know when your unfairly paid
415740	428740	labor force was carrying you all the while sending money home and boy the Sam a Californian
428740	434100	I mean I know better than the rest of the country that you know this concept that you
434100	440660	know my heart my heart bleeds for our for our for our wonderful friends from down south it must
440660	446700	be a terrifying time for them what a great show and it's like we're all just you know we're
446700	449460	experiencing that thing right now they're fucking with journalists and of course they started with
449460	456260	immigrants and like you know it's like I know it's cliche but it's like come on you're next it
456260	460460	doesn't matter how what you are it doesn't matter you're next you're next like you're either gonna
460580	466620	like put on the jumpsuit and get into the honeycomb in the Mars base or you're gonna be I mean there's
466620	471380	not I don't know what people keep thinking they keep thinking like oh if we just are polite
471380	478540	enough if we just like our if we just adhere to our own rules of what makes good people enough this
478540	484740	is gonna this is gonna blow over it's I don't know man it's like like like it's hard to it's
484740	490940	hard to say these words but it's just not it's not gonna stop until until it's like and then you
490940	496260	have to stop talking because then you're what are you encouraging I don't know we all have to like
496260	501300	just sit cross legged in the street and just eat Twinkies until the world stops turning or something
501300	508020	I don't know is that they can't put all of us in prison I don't know what to do I put the guest
508020	511820	here in there that they could come in and maybe they could give us some guidance and stuff but
512100	517700	you know that one guy whoever you are that I don't know where you tweeted or whatever oh I wish I missed
517700	521860	the days when the show could go for an hour without talking about Trump well what I why don't you suck
521860	530580	my dick and like again it's like wait what it was wait what and then the people on the Instagram
530580	536140	like what's I have my iPad I play with my photo app I'm he's the most famous guy in the world he's
536140	540420	on everyone's mind I'm gonna fuck with his face put it on a hot dog or something I it's not a
540420	545260	fucking meme I just think these 15 year olds going like dude your meme game is weak you're
545260	550700	the losing side of a meme war motherfucker it's called photography what what so are these people
550700	555140	they just came into our world like larva and I just like think that every it's just like these
555140	560700	horrible animal people terrible just dumb people they're just awful people with brains the size
560700	567580	of capers they're just like just bad bad people and you can't you can't humanize them anymore and
567580	571220	I know you're not supposed to side with the split you're supposed to like with the we're supposed
571220	575660	to be the good guys we're supposed to believe but it's just no you're a fucking dumbass you're a
575660	581740	terrible and you make up apparently at least enough of the country just barely enough of the
581740	586540	country that yeah that now now this is all with your liberal tier mugs and I just like fucking
586540	593980	don't fuck yourself and I just I was gonna buy a Tesla I was I was I was this close to retirement I
593980	598860	was I was I was I was in the zone I was so I was gonna be that was fucking sliding through man I

622940	638340	housekeeper I give her children my clothes isn't she El Salvador she looked at me weird when I did
638340	652860	but I did wait you invited her the wedding Aaron did I can't talk to her I I can't I can't
652860	659500	talk to her Dan Dan can't talk to her I can't which is great because I could talk to her just fine
659500	664180	yeah she's the best we have the same housekeeper Sophia and she's the fucking she's my diver she

669780	676220	to her but it is quite possible because Dan I mean she speaks she speaks very good English
676220	683060	but it's not a first language but she's like super badass hard-working I told you the time
683060	686620	about Harvey when she came over and talked about Harvey when she first started working for you
687540	699660	I can't talk people who talk quietly people who I like I am the guy who in every conversation is
699660	705660	always going what what what and like the fifth time you say what you feel like a dick like so
705660	711660	then I just like and I'm just like really riddled with social anxiety like I I've made up I've made
711660	716940	up my mind at some point I guess and and go ahead laugh it up when I say this that I could get
716940	723740	through this life without offending anyone ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha you're Dan Harmon you're
723740	730460	like a pariah you only offend people but it's not I'm not trying that's the difference like
730460	734980	I'm not trying not to and then I'm like I just put my foot in my mouth or whatever I just I just
734980	739540	I'm just riddled riddled with social anxiety I just don't want to be the bad guy I don't want to say
739540	743980	no to people I don't want to you know that's why after the show I just I just run out and I get I get
743980	750540	into a jet ski and I just I just and then I'm like there's no water there's no water because I don't
750540	755100	want to I don't want to because I don't want to tell the third person that wants to get a photo
755100	758860	after the show after I talk for two hours oh well I don't want what do you say no what do you say
758860	762700	notice somebody that's crazy you don't say no so instead I did this rude behavior I just fucking
763700	772140	I just throw down ninja balls and ninja ninja testicles are when you when they hit the floor they
772140	779020	emit a sound it's the it's the it's the sound of the of the ninja's heart dying and it's so
779020	783260	spiritually distracting that you don't notice someone running away in the movies they characterize
783260	790140	it as smoke but now people know if they want to get get to you after the show just hang out by the
790140	795580	jet ski that's out front yeah well I always put it in a different place and don't try listening
795580	806020	for the engine because it's solar-powered it's a Tesla jet ski so you decided it's a jet ski
806020	811860	you saw mr. musk tweeting about it they're here just for a select few I'm part of a white glove
811860	817660	program I'm checking it out it's a test ski so you've decided against getting the Tesla now
817660	824180	yeah I just got a test key no I well I can't look I'm I got my money I'm not I'm not a liquid man
824180	832380	okay unlike the one of the wonder twins right I I I definitely you know money comes into the
832380	838340	Harman Empire and I definitely like I put it back out into the fields you know like I plant more
838340	843900	seeds I go like oh let's let's meet with these people and let's let's do this out of pocket
843900	848620	let's let's start this or that I don't know it's just kind of like but moreover it's not about me
848620	853500	being philanthropical it's about me like instead of taking jobs that pay I kind of tell well why
853500	860380	don't I do this project that's kind of will pay off later so I am kind of largely what you a rich
860380	867980	person would call broke I don't really look at the actual bank statements but I just said you can
867980	873220	see leave ease like the blood leaves his face he's like a thermometer like like like he looks at it
873220	880980	and I'm like how are you doing what's going on pretty good it sounds like sounds like I'm down to 40
880980	888220	grand better better get that better turn in one of these treatments I learned how to write this
888220	898740	weekend I fucking finally that's good news I mean I really I was like I because I you go into therapy
898740	906980	and and and and you know I look I I've said in the past I've been like can you please help me I don't
906980	914860	know why I sometimes write very slowly and and and you know I was like well like like for a while I was
914860	918940	always like well you know just breathe and I'm like okay I'm breathing and then and then like what
918940	924460	just like I'll take you through a meditation and just you know is God a part of your writing and
924460	933100	I'm like I'm like yeah I mean he is but or she but it's like like like like well and and she's like
933100	938380	well just say to God like you take care of the quality I'll take care of the quantity and I was
938380	942460	like okay that's good and then and then I was like yeah take care of the quality I'll take care of
942460	945700	that and then I got home was it well that's just you're just saying what everyone keeps saying to
945700	953860	me which is right faster you just threw God under the bus and just like so then I didn't bring it up
953860	957460	for a couple weeks but then I went in because I was like really jammed up on this treatment and
957460	963980	I was just like it was just torture it was like I have these like modes of operation where you've
963980	969140	seen if you've if you're a fan of mine that you you know I can like I could like you know I'll do a
969140	973260	thing where I'm like oh I'm upside down in a tank and I'm typing a screenplay well there's snakes on
973260	980180	me and and and then it's like oh look how fast and that's pretty good for snake typing and then
980180	985740	also I'll collaborate with other people like that was the thing is as a community I had to learn to
985740	990540	collaborate with writers and then I had to let go of this terror I had of letting people see my
990540	997460	process and and so I was explaining that to her and she said well are you one of these people that
997460	1003420	goes to a cafe because you you know you want to be seen writing or something I said you you you
1003420	1009300	mean a hack no I'm not she's like well I don't know if those people are hacks or not but it's
1009300	1015340	like well what I mean they're not they can't be good I like and she's like well I think some
1015340	1020020	people want to be seen writing it like makes them feel like they got to keep writing or something
1020020	1024740	I'm like okay all right they're not they're good people but no that's not me I've never done that
1024740	1029980	which is interesting data like and it's like I wouldn't type next to Cody if I was on an airplane
1030220	1037860	like because she wouldn't be part of the process so but I work good with collaborators and and Mr.
1037860	1045380	Nimoy and and and I and I and I could do it as performance and then it was like oh okay so
1045380	1052100	there's something going on here but I used and so she's like so who are the people what are the
1052100	1056500	people providing I'm like well you know they let me off the hook because they're kind of like you
1056500	1061860	know they're they're they're okay with whatever's going on and she's like you see you're performing
1061860	1067340	you can look like everyone's looking up your skirt and they're saying like I like that I was
1067340	1074300	like okay yeah and she's like and so once and so it's these times when you say okay I'll go do
1074300	1078060	that alone and then I'll bring my work back that it's like it's like yeah I guess it's like saying
1078060	1082580	okay let me go away for three hours and I'm gonna really do something great under my skirt and then
1082580	1087820	come back and lift it up and and that and that yeah enough that it's like what are you supposed
1087820	1099540	to do and she's like yeah see so see so the the I mean I know you guys are gonna go like oh that
1099540	1106460	doesn't help me right at all well fuck you it's my $200 I'm just telling you what I learned she says
1106460	1114620	she goes well you know you know tell me like a like a like a like a memory of you writing and I've
1114620	1119580	told you guys the story brother got caught playing with matches and I was with him and and then wait
1119580	1124740	till your dad gets home and then my my my mom said well your dad's coming home why don't you write one
1124740	1130380	of those stories you write and about a boy that gets caught playing with matches and lives to
1130380	1135580	regret it and I was like okay good and then I like wrote the story and then I got meta and I was like
1135580	1139740	at the end of the story of the little boy like write such a good story that the mom's like oh
1139740	1143860	your dad doesn't have to spank you now and that was the story and I gave it to my mom and she was
1143860	1152780	like ha ha this is amazing I don't buy the ending and I was like I think that's kind of like a you
1152780	1156860	know I've mythologized that story but I do also think that that is truly she's like yeah when
1156860	1161820	you're working and you and she said so tell me about God and your work and I said I said well
1161860	1166620	okay this is gonna be hard to explain but it's like you get out like there yeah there's a God
1166620	1171660	whatever you want to call that it's nothingness it's the cosmos it's life itself whatever it's
1171660	1180020	the Dow it's it's Isis that's what Isis worships right Isis that's why they're called Isis they
1180020	1190700	worship the Greek goddess Isis form of an ice Isis that'd be amazing it's like you could see how
1190700	1195020	there would be you know there would be friction there with the rest of Islam it's like Isis what
1195020	1204660	isn't that like a cat lady all right what are you are you cat burglars is that no we we hurt
1204660	1209660	people real bad okay well then it's not funny I guess well Dan Harmon's next show he's gonna
1209660	1216940	make it real funny take advice on Isis what was show to go to well I love love Dan Harmon show
1216980	1223900	that's all I'm saying get out of here Isis everyone's up everyone's a theater recommender
1223900	1235700	patron so you're talking about God so I said what has been my standard answer which is you
1235700	1242580	have to you have to you know you have to be there you have to put a hole in your chest and
1243220	1253860	like God comes through and because God can't write he's like you know he can write on stone with
1253860	1260180	lightning well I mean you gotta like bring him the stone or something did that happen in the
1260180	1266060	Bible but he can't like write an episode of Nash bridges he can't you know I mean it would take
1266060	1276420	forever on the first day Nash bridges is making an omelet the fireballs are hitting the tablets
1276420	1286140	they say I gotta start a new tablet I'm not even done with the master shot the doorbell rings God
1286140	1290780	the PAs are getting tired of walking up and down the mountain with your tablets is it can we can we
1290780	1303620	streamline this process go tell them do you want a bad show or a good one and then God finally like
1303620	1308420	this is like we're rolling in an hour and God goes down the hill and like David milch just lays on
1308420	1317540	the set and shouts dialogue out while the actors perform all right so I said you know you put a you
1317540	1325380	put a hole in yourself so that God comes through you don't want to impede it and you know you want
1325380	1335460	that hole as wide and as as as possible and like it's gonna scrape the edges of your hole and that's
1335460	1340460	your voice that's your style you know but like people mistake that for meaning like oh you got
1340460	1347180	to make that hole cookie-shaped you know like I'm gonna oh I'm look at look at my indie movie you
1347180	1351260	could tell I wrote the shit out of it let's like that's somebody that's like their hole isn't
1351260	1358300	circular it's not like pure you know it's like will you please let God just do his work here he's
1358300	1363140	trying to write and he can't write because he has to use tablets otherwise that's not part of it
1363140	1372100	so she said so what I'm hearing is this process involves the removal of your heart and that you
1372100	1383340	that you can fuck up by being too there at the moment when God is there and like you to the
1383340	1389260	extent that he's there you have to not be there that's part of the process okay all right a little
1389860	1395940	gotcha therapy and she's like so what do you think the other people are providing like do you
1395940	1400020	feel do you do you believe you really believe in God do you think he cried I said I don't know I
1400020	1406940	believe that nothingness over infinity has a hundred percent chance of deciding to explode
1406940	1416380	into everything makes sense I dropped out of college makes sense to me I watched a Nova I
1416380	1424860	and and and so I think there's an impulse to all of existence that that prefers existence
1424860	1429220	over non-existence that as a tendency there's I don't think you can go all the way call it
1429220	1434860	consciousness and yet it's so vast and we're all a part of it that yeah I think there's something
1434860	1442140	ineffable that like if you kind of like if you're if you're on its side or if it sees benefit in
1442140	1448460	letting you do your thing then you you have better luck I guess like you call that karma or something
1448460	1453180	or you just sort of like or maybe just look at it like there's a there's a balance to the universe
1453180	1458140	so if you're out of the moment you tend to like have shitty days because you're trying too hard
1458140	1461460	and then when you're in the moment you feel you know you have those days or you feel like you're
1461460	1466580	in the zone and that's cuz that's cuz the you you just if you surrender to nothingness you're
1466580	1471500	that's like Taoism like you just kind of like you're you're jamming along and you're you're
1471500	1479980	tooting your horn and you're you're blowing your friends and you're just having so I was like well
1479980	1484340	you can't blow a horn you already chewed at that I don't know what what's the list of things people
1484340	1493980	do so I'm letting you into my process and you're and you're telling me with your laughter you're
1493980	1498500	saying it doesn't matter you can fuck up and say to your horn below your friends we like that we
1498500	1503940	like everything that you do because we know that it's happening in the moment and we like when you
1503940	1515340	widen your hole so much that we don't scrape its edges so she's like well don't you think that what
1515340	1519700	it is because I was like well there was a time before community when I didn't I didn't know how
1519700	1524420	to collaborate and it was like did you write then were you productive then yeah more so than after
1524420	1529060	community and I think what it was is I kind of came up with this one I'm gonna give myself credit I
1529060	1535420	was like oh so I think that what that means is that I I lacked something that I gained from
1535420	1540620	collaboration and I didn't want to go back to writing alone because it would be like going off
1540620	1546180	of heroin you know back to just cold turkey but neither thing was actually what you're supposed
1546180	1550940	to be doing you're supposed to somehow be generating this adoration you're supposed to like love
1550940	1558020	yourself and self-care you're supposed to atone with a God that actually is glad that you exist
1558020	1562460	and is thankful that you are writing it doesn't care it doesn't think that there's any way for
1562460	1567780	you to fuck up because good writer bad writer whatever it's like God's like Jeff Bridges in
1567780	1572980	Starman he's just hanging out he's going like whoa like like Nash Bridges that's brilliant like like
1572980	1583980	it was the show so weird that that's my go-to reference I I think it's cuz at my WGA orientation
1583980	1587980	there was a winner on the table and like tell the story of how you got to the WGA and someone
1587980	1593700	who was like I wrote a Nash Bridges and I just always thought that was so funny because they
1593700	1597300	worked at Nash Bridges and then someone got sick and then they're like I can write Nash Bridges
1597300	1604180	and I was like this story does not like reflect well on Nash Bridges he was just like like this
1604180	1610540	person was like I deliver pepper to the Nash Bridges office and and then a wheel fell on
1610540	1616140	someone from the salt truck and I just they said hey what what would a detective do if he
1616140	1624620	was in Texas I don't know where Nash Bridges and I just drew on my pepper experience I was like
1624620	1631420	maybe he sneezes and I want an Emmy and here I am now I have a dental plan and fuck the pepper
1631420	1645420	industry they act like it's an honor to work for them I was like Hollywood's fair so she the bottom
1645420	1651940	line is you know and you're like oh I'm a Dan Harmon fan I'm a I'm an atheist I hate God I hate
1651940	1658540	the concept of God I get it you're smart I love you you're fine because I'm God I love you because
1658540	1664700	I believe in God because how would you be this special if there was nothing out there like what
1664700	1670580	do you think is coursing through me fucking magnets you think I was just born on a rock that had like
1670580	1677540	a weird angle to it I've got God in me you don't believe in it cuz you're like damn then that means
1677540	1691460	he hates me well be holier than thou no but I know I look I'm not you know don't miss out
1691460	1696420	let's like some people get so triggered by the fucking g-word they're like oh the Dan's like
1697300	1703700	look I'm just saying like like what it's Tom Hanks volleyball it's like it's like you need
1703700	1708260	you need a mythology you're a primate you have the you were born with equipment that
1708260	1713820	spontaneously generates mythology it's like why would you I'm not saying why would you it's like
1713820	1719180	you also it also generates like science and that's like very we need way more atheists and skeptics
1719180	1723500	and we need way more science right now than we that we need the other thing but but I'm just saying
1723500	1728260	you do have the software and hardware in your head that like you you actually have to like suppress
1728260	1732420	it like you tend to invent shit in your head when you're looking for a parking spot and you're like oh
1732420	1738420	man I missed that spot because I shouldn't have been a dick to that barista like you do just you
1738420	1745180	you always do it like you and and you're the you know you watch stories and in movies and TV that
1745180	1749700	you like they're all like circling around like this concept that there's an order to the universe
1749700	1755380	because you're a sentient monkey and it's really fucked up like we lost we got we got mentally ill
1755380	1759980	when we became conscious like we were just animals and we were like running around and there are other
1759980	1763380	animals were eating us and we were eating them and it was like this is great it's a game of monopoly
1763380	1768380	like who cares it's fun like like it's not fun for us because we don't have claws and we're just
1768380	1772460	like getting our ass kicked because we're like wait who came up with this idea of being a monkey
1772460	1778180	that can't be in a tree and then and then we just kind of exploded one day who knows maybe it's just
1778180	1783740	your brain gets to a certain size maybe if you eat enough muscles I don't know but but you get
1783740	1791460	enough vitamin B or something and then we were like whoa I get it you're born and then you die and
1791460	1800180	then we like looked down at the gazelle brain we were eating and we're like Jesus Christ Jesus
1800180	1807780	Christ and then we calmed down enough to get through the day but we're just like you can't you
1807780	1813180	know really see that that's that origin story of Jesus Christ is so much less complicated than
1813180	1818660	or virginal birth yeah and wise men people will tell you has had something to do with Jerusalem no
1818660	1827580	it goes back to 30,000 BC and no I'm just saying like it's hard it's we when you watch an Eli Roth
1827580	1832580	movie like like yeah the thing that's the thing that you're getting high off of if you're enjoying
1832580	1836580	it or the thing that's freaking you out if you're not enjoying it is that it's a it's a it's hitting
1836580	1843340	your system as a toxicity because the signal you're getting is that nothing you know you you can't do
1843340	1849300	anything to like like like make bad things not happen to good people you can't you don't know
1849300	1854700	when an eyeball is just gonna fall out of a head or when a weird Czechoslovakian company is gonna
1854700	1862580	print business cards that allows people to be a secret Harry Potter society if the blow torches
1862580	1869540	people's faces when there's got to be other stuff those people can do that lady that just wants to
1869540	1879060	lay in a bath and like use a scythe on a backpacker and bathe in her blood like how many times has she
1879060	1886860	done that what are you talking about I have no idea I fell off this train like it's one of those
1886860	1894660	hostel movies I don't know if it's hostel one or hostel two she's getting more hostel like but but yeah I mean there's a
1894660	1899340	whole tub there she had built you know that like I mean it's like that's pretty how many how many
1899340	1905540	women has she bathed in the blood of and that's gotta get like change it up like like is it she
1905540	1911380	think it makes her strong is is in that movie is that what there's no magic in that movie if she
1911380	1914900	like could jump higher when she did it then I'd be like okay well that's what happened like look how
1914900	1918820	high she can jump but she doesn't want to jump lower that's that's that's what happens she's
1918820	1922340	dependent on the blood but I would assume that after a while she'd be like you know my sciatic
1922340	1928100	nerve is still acting up and no amount of this sticky gross blood that I bathe in is helping me
1928100	1935620	uh not age um so I'm gonna try just yogurt and sitting at home and save 500 grand
1936980	1944420	okay so anyways the I'm just saying I'm just saying life is like like we are like God to us
1944420	1948740	like like like when he doesn't exist is like Eli Roth like like like it's like it's like oh we're
1948740	1954260	in the hands of a maniac like uh log could fall on uh on my caveman friend and then it's like
1954260	1958660	not his fault it's not my fault and it's like oh man I just fell in love oh now I feel a lump and
1958660	1963940	like like oh now it's like a tiger ate my baby and like like like like you just you just run it
1963940	1968420	and also all the shitty things that you do you're like oh I killed the tiger for killing my baby and
1968420	1972660	now the tiger likes its heart looks like my heart and like I can't take it I can't take it there's
1972660	1978020	no cocaine or there's invented yet I can't like deal with this I gotta just run it around my cave
1978020	1984180	I'm gonna freak out freaking out and uh and I need some coke to calm calm down a little bit
1986100	1990580	and so then some smarty pants caveman was like you know like well look here's the thing I mean
1990580	1995940	look you know when that thunder happens that's angels bowling and the guy's like go on go on
1997700	2004420	are you singing my tune that tiger killed your baby you got baby points you're gonna get those
2004420	2012660	back later when you become a tiger in the next life and the angels are gonna bowl with me no
2012660	2017620	that's just ancillary cosmology that's I was like the angels just bowl like they don't even know
2017620	2022340	what the fuck's going on okay you just you're explaining thunder yeah don't let the thunder
2022340	2029460	freak you out you focus on your tiger points where do you redeem your tiger baby points
2030100	2036820	in the afterlife or in this in this life you go to confession and you say I bless you father
2036820	2043700	caveman for I had I had bad I had bad tigerless thoughts I have two tiger points and one baby
2043700	2048660	point and then and then the father caveman says like well you might as well just say one tiger
2048660	2054260	point because a baby point is the opposite of a tiger point okay I heard I've been told that but
2054260	2060580	your your your your ruling class doesn't let us uh learn math so uh well there's a reason for that
2060580	2064340	we don't want everybody just starting a random religion about every animal they see you're
2064340	2074340	gonna keep this fucking shit under your cave hat I understand all right well I can't we we haven't
2074340	2079700	invented hinges or slides or knobs yet so we're just sitting in a rock I can't it's not like we're
2079700	2088020	in a booth so why are you telling me that I don't know I just I start to I guess I'm feeling
2088020	2093060	like plagued with guilt being a caveman priest like I I don't I don't hunt I don't provide any
2093060	2100020	food um why are you unloading who's confessing here why are you laying this on me I don't even
2100020	2105460	know math I'm a caveman see now I'm gonna start a religion you Protestant piece of shit
2105460	2124260	uh anyways and that caveman name was martin luther stone martin luther's senior
2125780	2130980	remember the Flintstones trailer no you don't you're 11 uh there's a Flintstones trailer and
2130980	2136180	then it was like it said Stephen spiel rock presents spiel rock yeah let's have piss up a
2136180	2143060	rope what are you doing spiel rock yeah they didn't want to say stoneberg
2146340	2150260	to jewish I guess like I would say like like it like shines a light on the
2150980	2154660	they're like are you making a like no because there probably is an actual director named
2154660	2158100	Stephen stoneberg right there's that yeah
2163860	2168900	it got away with such hack shit back then the not the Flintstones movie uh the the the show
2169620	2175060	every show that you see in reruns it was all like it was all based on some like they took
2175060	2178820	like a character who was like a comic back then it would be they would just rip off their act and
2178820	2185780	like make them an animal fucking like like fuck your hacks oh that phil silvers is uh really
2185780	2191860	funny why don't we just make him a dolphin and make him a dolphin I don't know I don't
2191860	2195620	know what I'm talking about phil silvers was on everything him and don adams were in every
2195620	2199860	cartoon in some form or other yeah they also you know those comics they got jobs playing those
2199860	2206340	voices yeah yeah who played the great gazoo is that it was dumb dumb was it harvey corman yeah
2206420	2213940	yeah so let's say Harvey Keitel yeah after after a while the Flintstones uh ran out of gas a little
2213940	2221860	bit uh I guess they I guess they didn't expect it to run as long as it did because gas hadn't
2221860	2227540	been invented right because not enough dinosaurs had died to create gas so they added a fucking
2227540	2234420	alien that granted wishes yeah to just be alive back then like I just
2236820	2240660	yeah I don't know but yeah no but none of us could have jobs you know it's like it was less
2240660	2245540	less television less power than consolidated I would have been just like uh what would I what
2245540	2251300	would I have been I would have been um I think I would have been a welder because I lived I was
2251300	2260820	born in Milwaukee I would have been a welder and I would make like shitty sculpture in the
2260820	2265060	backyard and people would be like what are you doing trying to get out of Milwaukee
2268580	2277220	leave me alone just welding a bicycle rim to a ashtray I'm welding I'm welding a sculpture
2277940	2281700	to prove to my mom that I I've learned my lesson about playing with matches
2285060	2290900	all right so so I said I says to the therapist I says that's how it works and she says well just
2290900	2295140	be there and let the god hit you in the back and go into your body and then you'd be like
2295140	2299460	whoo it's fun to write if you if you suck or you're slow and I was like you're right so I can
2299460	2301460	I don't know right now
2307860	2310740	the long and winding road
2312980	2320420	Spencer what's going on uh in politics oh let me tell you Spencer politics corner
2320420	2330900	all right you guys hear about this tower fire in uh London town yeah it was a while ago
2332580	2339620	that happened oh boy it was a real mess health and safety is a big part of governmental
2339620	2346820	responsibility towards society and they really did not hold up their end of the bargain
2346820	2354420	and you see the results of that and it was very tragic and man it makes you wonder what it what
2354420	2362340	you think when people aren't valuing the safety of the American people so flaw of capitalism
2366500	2372580	that was the end of Spencer's politics I really deliver capitalism needs to be it's it's a great
2372580	2378980	system it's worked very well it needs to be augmented as in all of your pocket apps with a
2378980	2386340	additional mana currency right yeah something you have to buy from the app store not just something
2386340	2391540	you can generate internally because then you can cheat at the game you don't have to pay anything
2391540	2396660	right I recommend flogging I think we should flog ourselves you know you can you you can
2397460	2403140	I don't know in a way those crystals those that that alternate currency is political influence
2403140	2412420	isn't it yeah yeah you're pretty high right now man what you high no way man before a show
2413300	2418100	no no that's not professional I thought I I thought I would get a laugh if I asked so it's
2418100	2422820	just like I'm no I mean I'm chasing the dragon called laughs it's too real is there an episode
2422820	2426900	Spencer you could think back to or point back to you you think we you're the highest you've
2426900	2434740	ever been oh yeah I would easily say 224 enter the dragon for real are you joking
2434740	2443220	saying February 24th no episode 224 enter the dragon okay yeah Longbok was there
2443940	2450420	who was Longbok he wasn't in enter the dragon but he was a hero from martial arts films
2451380	2454020	I think this fucker's high
2457140	2460580	why are you trying to ask me to remember an episode in which I was high
2462580	2468180	yeah that's flawed logic there I guess yeah and I feel like on that count I delivered reasonably
2468180	2475220	well I'm not it's fine you guys are fine yeah yeah you're more than living up to your side of
2475220	2482340	the bargain audience the drunkest show had to be Nashville maybe for you oh yeah yeah and then
2482340	2488100	for me probably San Francisco towards the end of that tour I don't remember being in San Francisco
2488100	2498820	for that show yeah I was just tits up during that one yeah therapist gets in on me you know she's
2499780	2511300	she's trying to she brings up the drinking like like you know like she knows she can tell
2512340	2517380	she knows by the way I told you this didn't I like she keeps she she she she she uses family
2517380	2522660	guy as a as a reference to like yeah deal breaker the second time she did it I said because she's
2522660	2528020	like it's like with Peter you know the episode where he's got the thing I said therapist
2531380	2539940	if you if you use the family guy as common ground to to tanka me about our feelings
2540980	2547780	I'm gonna need a second therapist like and I have a cartoon you could watch
2547780	2555780	and and and she said I saw I saw an episode of it somebody was puking everywhere
2557460	2563140	what are you my mother but she knows she knows she knows the minute that I would come in and
2563140	2569140	she'd be like well how's your day by the way first thing I gotta say I spent the weekend watching
2570020	2576580	Rick and Morty that show is amazing it would be like three weeks later I'd be like gone
2578180	2582740	it's like there is something sick about I think she knows that she sees a lot of writers and
2582740	2586980	people working TV and stuff so I think she knows I don't know if she I don't I don't think she's
2586980	2590820	lying when she says she's only seen one episode I think she's just like I'm not gonna want I'm not
2590820	2596660	gonna become a fan of this windbag you know because he always because his whole all his
2596660	2602260	problems stem from his ability to like manipulate and control and dominate that's that's a total
2602260	2606100	sacrificing of the status that she needs to have in that room she needs to yeah she needs to be
2606100	2610340	formidable for me to listen to her about like I tried to watch Family Guy three times because
2610340	2617620	people kept telling me how good it is that show sucks it sucks it's not funny it's not you can
2617620	2622340	see every joke coming a mile away it's so I've never seen a frame of it so I'm out of this
2622340	2626980	conversation I don't I don't want any feuds it's the Toby Keith of animation
2630100	2635780	I'll say is I've heard about the show I know lots of people that worked on it and I know that
2635780	2640340	that your objection to Rick and Morty can't be a guy who was puking I've heard people I've got
2640340	2646900	people fuck horses on that show or something yeah people even puke on that show Rob Shrobs
2646900	2652180	been sending me those little voice messages you could do an eye messages and their impressions

2712100	2715700	I'm sorry like there was that but that's not how this conversation happened there was a there was
2715700	2720660	a song where someone was like singing in robot voice they were going like everybody oh that's
2720660	2725780	not a robot you can't do an impression of robot that was Michael McDonald from the dude yeah I
2725780	2732820	thought I could just do an impression of uh yeah uh I I uh but but but you know that robot voice
2732820	2738980	like not share auto-tune voice but just like take me to funky town robot voice like like
2739060	2741380	old-school silence kids

2762500	2771940	a hundred dollars from Netflix I ain't really got an iron grip on this industry um
2774260	2778420	I'm sure they pay very fairly I haven't closed my deal Spencer do you have it I think all right
2778420	2783300	with you let's try let me finish my story because I'll never all right well I'm gonna lose it then
2783300	2788740	I'm sorry let's put in air quotes it's more of a slice of life can you catch me up yeah yeah I
2788820	2792420	was listening to Daft Punk and there was a robot voice oh right not being that familiar with Daft
2792420	2797700	Punk I was like is that is that is the person singing in the robot filter is that uh the is
2797700	2803220	that the Daft Punk man is he like is is is there like a lead singer and does he does he do a lot
2803220	2810500	of robot singing and uh and uh and uh and Mike said no no it's it's like a guest guest vocalist
2810500	2818340	like they're you know largely a instrumental group and uh uh but and they're French so I don't
2818340	2823540	think they would want to sing because uh then they it would just sound weird because they'd be like
2823540	2832260	you must listen to ze robots and I thought that was really funny you must listen to ze robots
2833460	2835380	as I wrote it down and fuck you
2836020	2841780	I knew it wasn't gonna lay I knew they got some laughs I was like I wanted to share it
2841780	2848980	like that I didn't expect you to laugh they did laugh it's a little glimpse into your day
2848980	2853460	it's a nice moment we had there it was uh you need to listen to ze robots it's funny I don't
2853460	2860500	know you know you don't think about how that how how antithetical uh French stuff is to robot stuff
2861380	2864500	it's not like something you think about but then you go like yeah you know that's not near each
2864500	2869940	other on the color wheel no good reason it's just kind of funny the idea of a French robot
2870580	2874980	or a French French robotics I'm sure they're very capable um as you see that thing of course you
2874980	2879060	saw that thing but the one the Afghani uh girl robotics team that couldn't get in the country
2879060	2884980	yeah bullshit I mean I do could you could you like somebody go down there with a briefcase
2884980	2890420	and be like oops like like you pass like like they're not even concerned about the PR thing
2890420	2897940	then be concerned you just turned away a bunch of people that were like oh I know why I'm not uh
2897940	2902500	you know gonna cause any trouble it's because I fucking I don't want to be in the world of
2902500	2908420	technology and all this shit no back to back to Afghanistan with you but but but one thing has
2908420	2913940	changed about you on this trip you now hate America so do what you will with your robotic skills
2913940	2923140	which are now part of a rogue state and if your angle is that that we don't want Afghani
2923140	2930420	robot robot ladies here because they're against the American way we a Nazi put us on the moon
2930420	2937300	like I don't understand what is what is what is what is what is what is what is the mentality

3605860	3610020	satisfying i love yeah that was pretty good where is shrub how come he doesn't come to the show anymore
3610020	3617700	he's got a wife he had a wife when he was on the show too oh that's just what he says i don't know
3617780	3621460	i believe him but i don't know yeah it'd be great for him to be here tonight
3622420	3624580	yeah but remember when norman leer was here
3630740	3636900	what was was rob misbehaving during norman leer he was great remember it'd be great for anybody
3636900	3645380	to be here you know i i'm i'm i'm i'm on fire but how much more can i burn how much god can i let
3645380	3648420	through me let's see let's find out
3655540	3657140	women be shopping no
3661540	3664900	but you you you're saying you want god to pass through you but then you also told us earlier
3664900	3668500	that you are god so how does that what do you think happens when god passes through you and
3668500	3673460	what was my therapy story about it's i'm saying i used to let god go through the hole now
3673460	3680020	god comes in he don't get out now like you're like a roach motel for god yeah
3681380	3687860	or i like caught god like a leprechaun and i wished for the gold of good writing but does
3687860	3693620	god want to get out he probably wants to get out he might miss his old life from time to time but
3693620	3701780	he you know he he he wanted to see what it's like to be me so all right you know
3705300	3709700	can i you know i'm something like like like what i can't i can't i can't let him out i'm not god
3711700	3716980	i thought you are god not that god's inside you yeah but he's trapped i i i'm saying
3718100	3723300	i can't there's nothing i can do about it yeah you're god you just don't want god to get out
3723300	3725620	because then he's not going to be god anymore and then you're gonna go oh shit that should
3725620	3728900	have kept god in there and you know that god's not coming back in you when you let him out
3728900	3732980	because you're like that fucker kept me in there for like four weeks you're making me sound like
3732980	3738740	the devil now as if but you're making it sound like i really tricked god because i was really
3738740	3743940	the devil and uh now i trapped him and now i have all god's power and i'm actually the devil
3744660	3750340	here on earth to woo people with my liberal virtue signaling
3752820	3759620	into an antichrist movement that appears on its face to be a holy cult but that's how i get you
3759620	3766340	and then you have the number harmon on your head and then it's like doomsday and it turns out trump
3766340	3776020	was christ oh boy the joke is think about it like would you would you would you if you were
3776020	3781620	the antichrist would you come back as a person who looked exactly like the antichrist and acted
3781620	3788980	like him as it's jesus has come back in the form of donald trump and uh because he's again he he's
3788980	3796980	we're literally going to crucify him but you need a reason i don't know it's a working theory i
3798340	3804260	i had another theory that he's he's it's we're in his we're in his dream because he's just like
3804260	3809060	he's the old he's like we're all just like we just took us this long to start realizing like
3809060	3815220	because he's about to die in his dream well of old age and and and like his dream's gonna be over
3815220	3820740	good save good save uh and so and so it's like it's kind of like the end the the whole end of
3820740	3824500	everything like where it's like the coalescing like like we we walked around thinking we were
3824500	3828660	part of this like regular world but we didn't know we were just like in the we're in a jacob's
3828660	3836100	laddered scenario yeah i guess so but we're all mccauley kulkin oh yeah we're back to home we're
3836100	3840020	back on home alone again what's going on he's in uh jacob's ladder okay i don't want to spoil
3840020	3846020	jacob's ladder but mccauley kulkin's in it it sounds like a joke but he is and if i tell you
3846020	3853460	who he is it's kind of a spoiler because he's uh tim robin's dead son that is that sounds a lot
3853460	3860100	like a spoiler yeah that sounds a lot like it yeah where is our mccauley kulkin is he doing all
3860100	3865860	right i don't i think i think he i think he would say yes but i think like objective reports are
3865860	3872340	that he seems like he he's not well right that he is if you see him out that he's uh you know
3872340	3880340	he could use a hug right and maybe like some broccoli but you know who hangs out with him
3880340	3884660	seth green oh yeah we could have seth on and we could ask him how's mccauley doing we could have
3884660	3892420	mccauley on probably bring him some broccoli get hug the shit out of him but when mccauley comes
3892500	3895060	we're going to put boards with nails under all the windows
3897060	3903300	fucking get that guy you guys saw the theory online that uh mccauley kulkin's character
3903300	3905300	in home alone grows up to become jigsaw
3910180	3917460	it's pretty well thought out the time works it works really well that he like gets a taste for
3917460	3924580	human trapping and wait the timeline works pretty well i think so in that home alone happened
3924580	3930100	before saw movies i i can tell from the tone of your voice that you're about to prove me wrong
3930100	3936420	so no i just think that's very sound if you're saying that home alone oh you're sarcastically
3936420	3942260	high-fiving me i don't you know you're not gonna comment on your commenting because it
3942260	3947300	might be right or it might be wrong but you're saying of course the timing works one movie is
3947300	3954020	set well yeah well one here he's a kid and then presumably jigsaw is older so yeah that works out
3954020	3962900	perfectly how would it not how would that not work stay down dad stay down it would have to
3962900	3966740	be no i'm not going to stay down because you clearly haven't seen the saw franchise they fuck
3966740	3971220	with non-linear storytelling a lot there's a lot of flashbacks to like he works in a soup kitchen
3971220	3974500	in the 80s or something so maybe it doesn't work so there oh okay
3977300	3981940	but then there's that flash forward in home alone three where he's working at that soup kitchen
3990340	3996660	what is that what does that talk boy say what's the you filthy hey kids oh hey kids we're home
3996660	4002660	early that's the only one i remember someone says that it's in the i think it's in the commercial
4002660	4008980	one of the bandit says that no the the talk boy right the talk boy says hey kids we're home in
4008980	4014340	the commercial he goes hey kids we're home early and then he pitches it down and he goes hey kids
4014340	4020340	we're home early fucking and then the boyfriend he gets uncomfortable because he was getting a
4020340	4025540	little close you know oh so in the commercial if the parents were coming home it's a little
4025540	4032180	kid using it to freak out his teenage uh yeah sounds like slut-shamed sister yeah it is well
4032180	4040020	it's not her fault it's his fault it's 9 11 it's 9 11 really wow remember that video we saw you know
4040020	4045460	it's hot in birdbank but only a part of the audience cheers for 9 11 i hope it's hotter
4045460	4048260	up here than it is down there but probably not it's probably you guys dying out there i'm under
4048260	4054020	lights but you guys are it's it's not great it's mostly so still roaches kind of like on top of
4054020	4059780	each other do you know you know roaches love the they they're there's some word for it they love
4059780	4064500	they're more comfortable when they're on top of each other that's nice they're like kind of like
4064500	4069620	when you see a lone roach you're seeing a roach that is like stressed out feels the way you feel
4069620	4076180	when you see a roach is like it's like it's like a woody allen roach that's like i shouldn't be
4076180	4084340	doing what i'm doing that was a terrible so your roach is an older jewish man from new york well
4084340	4091140	isn't he an ants or something uh yeah but like who can't do a woody allen impression i guess me
4091140	4095380	that's pretty interesting to find out try again try again wait hold on let's go to a break and
4095380	4102980	on the break we cut out your attempt all right well let's go to a break a word from uh one of
4102980	4110020	our sponsors that you don't have to listen to if you paid five dollars a month right and i'm

4319300	4327380	tights and things and i i i stumbled into this this this uh this new branch of porn and sometimes
4327380	4331700	i think it's driven by if like if you're like writing in a deadline i found that cody has found
4331700	4336340	this too because she was she's writing it off she's in self-imposed like retreat right now
4336340	4340580	writing and she she was like damn five hour energies and i was like wait did you combine
4340660	4349060	it with adderall because five hour energy plus adderall is like new porn folder like uh like
4349060	4354420	you're gonna make some discoveries you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna
4354420	4360340	you're gonna you're gonna boldly go some like i don't i don't i i i you know i already have like
4360340	4367060	this leg and leg and hosiery kind of like thing and i i i i i i ended up there's this whole like
4367060	4375540	it's it's strap-on it's lesbian strap-on porn like it's like starts with like two women in
4375540	4383060	pantyhose and then one of one of them puts a but it's not it's strapless strap-ons because
4383060	4388260	there's a little thing there's a little dildo part that goes into the vagina of the woman that's
4388260	4399780	going to do the the um the um the endowment the investment um and and and but so it's like and
4399780	4406500	then they and then they do it like uh with the with the dildo but then also a lot of them they
4406500	4411460	have like a money shot because they have like a it's like a special effect dildo and then the
4411540	4417780	the woman pulls out and like since i guess since they know you know it's fake they they they they
4417780	4422740	can just go with like copious amounts so it's like a like a weird art piece and it's just like
4423860	4429540	slow motion wait there's there's fake semen inside the the strap the strap of the strap-on
4429540	4438100	try keep up and how how do they what's the trigger system on that how do i don't know what's
4438100	4441700	happened i don't know if it's like they do this with guy you ever see a like regular porn like
4441700	4446900	where it's like oh wait that's a fake cum shot it's like i don't know if they they do they like
4446900	4450740	maybe the guy has like a tube under the dick or something and they'll like cut to a different angle
4450740	4458260	and then the guy'll be like oh and then like all this like cake batter will just fly out it's just
4458260	4462500	anyway just like well that doesn't really i mean you're you jumped the shark here like it doesn't
4462500	4466980	really you should if you just did that but choked up on the bat like i don't put it in it but but
4467780	4472180	but but i guess i don't know it's something interesting like when there's like women like
4472180	4477220	like like beautiful women and they're in there and then they're uh it's high def and then they're
4477220	4482180	i don't know i've got like eight or nine videos now that are like wow i feel so cosmopolitan i'm
4482180	4490900	kind of i'm into like uh lesbian strap-on action yeah with a with a with a crazy rick baker
4490900	4497460	special effect cum shot that is so cosmopolitan of you i love that i feel like i should i should i
4497460	4510180	should i should i should drink a mojito and listen to npr and we're back public radio i i'm so is there
4510180	4519460	is there what's the what's the handle for that i i i i uh i i uh i i felt i i find it ironic that
4519460	4524340	i felt just a little bit of judgment from you but you're writing this down the cap is on my pen
4524340	4531140	you can't wait to hear this because you want to know i'm just curious hot to you admit it it
4532100	4540260	sounds okay it sounds hot uh it had me i don't know but i don't know if the rick hums the rick
4540260	4544660	baker i'm watching it on pornhub the thing in the corner i'm trying to remember it says like uh
4545220	4552580	rick rick baker cum shot make sure it strap on it says i think i want to say strapless dildo.com
4555860	4561780	well there's feel fieldo is the name of the of what those things are right uh
4561780	4568900	feel right
4572580	4576820	fieldo fieldo i guess because you could you can feel it while you're doing because as opposed to
4576820	4582420	a strap on that's just like yeah all right it makes sense it's kind it's uh you know like hey
4582420	4588740	it's progressive it sounds like potentially everyone's a winner yeah everyone's a wiener
4588740	4600260	everyone has a wiener inside them everyone is a win oh everyone i'm gonna get back to you on
4600260	4609380	this one it's not about whether you wiener lose nice it's um how you play the game yeah
4609380	4625300	yeah that wasn't that good uh let's bring steve leavy up uh to the stage hey
4629940	4636580	what what was that he just farted what wait what was that what was that that wasn't from me he's
4637460	4641940	he's gonna blame the chair but it was uh he clearly farted when he came on stage do we have
4641940	4647620	playback on that i think that was from the audience sound like a chair that was squeaking
4649220	4655940	well no it didn't it sounded like a funny playful fart but i'll i'll i can use honestly i thought
4655940	4664340	it was you uh uh uh uh uh what's the weirdest porn you've uh uh landed on lately well you're uh uh
4664660	4672500	uh tweaking out on and uh legal meth legal meth yeah adderall i don't take that at all i know
4672500	4680340	we'll just roll with this i don't have you ever done any drug any any legal uh substance no yeah
4680340	4687220	good for you thanks you wanna you want to try something what do you got i guess do you drink
4687220	4692740	at all steve leavy i don't i've never had a drink in my life what really yeah i thought you knew
4692740	4698740	that i don't i guess in my life like you're like super yeah but also steve's one of those
4698740	4708500	people that thinks butt chugging doesn't count i've never been in in college in college i had
4708500	4715700	a friend who who always threatened to get me basted which is where they they take vodka in a
4715700	4722020	turkey baster and you shove it up your ass and squeeze it out wow and get drunk really fast
4722020	4725780	apparently yeah also you find out who your friends aren't
4728340	4733540	or are they also they also make one where the turkey basically goes inside your your your butts
4733540	4737860	and then you put it in somebody else's butts it's called i i always heard you said that's called
4737860	4744420	feaster i i heard i always heard that that's called a slow thanksgiving it's like it's like
4744420	4757460	slow news day slow thanksgiving conversation sort of hit a lull with that vodka that's a thing
4757460	4762980	that's fucking wow yeah basting is that what you're allowing as a thing i'm allowing that i wonder
4762980	4767700	who's doing that like oh the idea it's youth because they're saying like whoa it's all about
4767700	4771460	the thrill i'm like the chuck yagger of getting drunk you also don't need that much and it gets
4772260	4776180	it gets your drunk yeah i mean that's so oh you don't need that much like i'm sure the college
4776180	4780500	kids doing this are not our support system i think it was more a problem in high schools
4780500	4785380	right i don't know how is it different than butt chugging it's the same i think you can
4785380	4788820	you don't have to do like a handstand i guess you can just you have the apparatus and go
4791220	4794900	squeeze it squeeze the desired amount of vodka inside you
4794900	4798420	yeah and i thought it was clever getting basted it sounds great
4802260	4806180	it's just amazing that i yeah i didn't have friendships like that where it was like
4807060	4811300	like okay put this in my butt like i'm not saying i'm not trying to be home before you have like
4811300	4817780	this is very intimate uh like like like at an age when you're most defensive and all that stuff
4817780	4822980	but then you hear stories like people's sexual development like like people summer camp stories
4822980	4828500	and things there's like different it's like everybody has like a weird story from their
4828500	4834820	life like there's nobody got through with what anyone would describe as a normal sexual development
4834820	4841620	like everyone has like one like thing that would make other people go wait what wow uh but like
4841620	4848820	and and like yeah i i'm but but uh you know one thing that i never did was like well i mean i
4848820	4853460	told you guys about the humping the pillows with my friend like but uh i had a friend that we were
4853460	4858340	certain this is like i think it might have been our first year of college but we're hanging out
4858340	4863860	at our friends from high school's house and we're hanging out and i won't say his name but a good
4863860	4869540	friend of mine to this day he was a very interesting sexually active at a very young age guy

5064660	5072340	okay so spencer you want to explain for the people who saved five dollars this one yeah there was a
5072340	5078660	soccer clip and it quickly cut to an old man or woman lying you know listeners for five dollars
5078660	5086900	a month being licked by cows you can see rob shrub uh rick roll you into uh watching a man's
5086900	5094500	dick be sucked by a cow it was a guy laying down in the field and uh i mean first it was soccer
5096340	5101060	yeah for three three seconds it's a clip of a shrub does this thing where he he does these
5101060	5105940	clips where it's like someone's about to hit a baseball and then like because he i think he
5106020	5110820	there's me there's what what are the videos like that where it's like your sense of anticipation
5110820	5115460	as a viewer is heightened because something's about to happen like a baseball's about to get
5115460	5121780	hit or something's about to impact and then it'll cut to like a crazy porn clip with like a woman
5121780	5127540	getting hit in the face with a giant dick or something um and uh this one was uh a soccer
5128340	5133620	game and the guy's about to kick what will either be a goal or not a goal so now you're invested
5134260	5140660	you lean in and it cuts to as his foot impacts the ball it cuts to a man laying in a field with
5141300	5148100	multiple cows around him one cow is kissing his ear one cow is kissing his ear no nipple play
5148100	5157140	um but uh the main cow i'll call him is uh is is just is look i mean it's like he's
5157940	5164420	uh i i mean you'll see why in a second he's suckling on his penis i guess i hope i hope
5164420	5170900	he's not chewing on it i hope he thinks it's an utter not a not a field it was it's disturbing
5170900	5177060	because the cow is like going up and down and it's just it was an unfortunate clip to receive
5177060	5181220	and i did and i didn't send it to you i didn't send the guy he sent it to me you think i mean
5181220	5186660	he's crazy oh okay yeah all right you gotta be so relaxed to not fidget during that he was so still
5186660	5190500	like he was completely he knows that well he's been out there hours that you have to stay still
5190500	5196020	for the to get the cows to come right it's like seagull seagull hunting right yeah did i tell you
5196020	5203300	guys about the time that i scared a bunch of buffaloes no so like i was camping on catalin
5203300	5210580	as long as you scared the whole buffalo then you're i was camping on catalin island and
5210580	5216180	there was just a bunch of buffalo had wandered in and so i snuck into the middle of the the pile of
5216180	5221780	buffalo or whatever not a pile it was like a group though and then i played a really loud sound on
5221780	5227140	like an emergency radio it like hadn't a siren and then all the buffalo like scattered in all
5227140	5231380	directions but i didn't realize that they could have scattered in like one direction and like
5231380	5236900	just ran me over and i could have just been murdered on an island yeah you just you forced
5236900	5240580	to stampede that you could have been right in the middle yeah and i definitely would have deserved
5240580	5244180	it really dumb way to die yeah they must have thought you looked like an alligator right
5244980	5250100	it's not just enough he's like he's i i i think i'm sure i said we need to like we need to hire
5250100	5254020	like a person who's just in charge of telling if we can go like i'm sure i've said this before and
5254020	5259780	then the person could go yes he did let's go have a little alcoholic like uh deputy but uh
5260660	5264820	but i was sitting with dino and they're talking about buffalo is that have you had buffalo meat
5264820	5268340	or something like that i'm like buffalo meat this is an endangered species he's like no no they're
5268340	5273380	fine now i guess i was like what how do we we saved buffalo and he's like yeah yeah they're
5273380	5278100	fine there's like a million of them or whatever i'm like that's not a lot it's like don't don't
5278100	5284180	get off on a tangent in the your retelling of this um and i i won't i won't um but i was like
5284180	5287940	how did we how did we save buffalo that fast there's all these endangered species and he and
5287940	5294580	he said tina said well have you ever seen a female buffalo and he and he he whistled he
5294580	5300900	did the i can't whistle he's like did that did that whistle well his hands formed the perfect
5300900	5309460	outline of a buffalo like like i mean it's like he he went
5312100	5316420	it was like if there was a hieroglyphic of a buffalo he just traced it with his hands
5316420	5322420	while making that whistle it was the funniest uh and then trump got elected

5478580	5483380	tom fell's unconscious all right so uh and yet woke
5487700	5493700	so we run downstairs or i run downstairs and then go off in the in in pursuit of the ghost yeah
5493700	5499700	all right it's uh it seems to be going a bit north towards the edge of town the location of
5499700	5505380	the graveyard even though i don't need it because we're following a ghost i use no direction so i
5505380	5517220	can discern north oh it's that way all right i just wanted to use that uh well level zero spell
5518020	5525380	yes good while we're walking notes diarrhea how do you think that went down what did we do right
5525380	5532500	would we how can we avoid i wasn't you know i got caught up in the moment and i wasn't really paying
5532500	5537940	attention to what you guys are doing i what do you woodpeckers are i'm really ashamed of myself
5537940	5545300	and i let fear take over i i should have just talked to that woman before acting so violently
5545300	5553620	you know it wasn't very churchly of me well we're a different kind of church uh we're part
5553620	5562180	of the church militant we're out here to kick button you know and and take diarrhea i think
5562180	5567300	i don't i think that uh it's great i mean this is what this is what it's all about it's about
5567300	5572100	uh penitence uh after the fact like it's not whether you make mistakes it's about how you repair
5572740	5581700	so good job like i i'll tell you what i did wrong everything like i i i ran my mouth i i thought i
5581700	5585940	ran upstairs when i shouldn't have i like went in there you know it's just like i gotta hang back
5585940	5592500	and i gotta slow my role i haven't been out of the uh place that i was before the adventure started
5592500	5598900	in a while during this i'm taking some cloth and bandaging up my sliced ankles and i also
5598980	5604020	use some cloth to bandage bandage uh dj up too all right thanks you succeeded that
5605620	5610420	but it's never too late to start fresh that's what i wanted to say to you guys i say we start
5610420	5615940	let's say we got off to a bouncy start uh but now mistakes were made lessons were learned
5616500	5621220	let's be professional about this let's look under every bed and every room we go into from now on
5621220	5625540	and let's also you know let's let's let's when we encounter other people
5626420	5630820	let's not assume that they're monsters and that they're hiding something that's i'm talking to
5630820	5641940	myself uh i think that uh the silver flame is shining on us in a world where a bouncy mission
5641940	5647060	can result in a child being freed of an evil spirit there were no that was beautiful there
5647060	5652340	were no deaths on that that was beautiful um did the ghost just leave or we are we still following
5652740	5656900	yeah okay we're walking that was a walk and talk yeah that was that was a walk and talk
5658900	5663220	how close are we to the graveyard oh man you're there oh
5665460	5670980	all right um the graveyard's on the edge of this little this this forest the forest stands thick
5670980	5678020	as and imposing it looms over the buildings of the tiny town kind of like uh like like an ominous
5678020	5685620	horizon of clouds um there's air coming from the forest it feels a bit more fresh than uh like the
5685620	5690580	stale town air but you make your way to the graveyard it's a little rickety graveyard
5690580	5695380	for a small little town but there's a lot of graves in it more than you'd expect for a town
5695380	5702740	of this size which is about 10 people conservatively um it's a little graveyard just full of graves
5702740	5712100	you see some graves um yeah i examine the dates of the deceased oh there's no dates
5713860	5715860	it's as if someone didn't write them down
5719700	5724260	i have no idea when these people died maybe they didn't want us to know
5725700	5729780	well do you think we could tell just from looking at the freshness of the graves like
5729780	5736820	what's the ratio of fresh graves to old graves um you see you see there's maybe about three
5736820	5745220	graves that seem pretty fresh like uh like less than a month fresh where did the ghost go the
5745220	5750980	ghost it went over to the to the thing and it kind of where it went like above the graveyard
5750980	5757780	and it kind of faded out and went wow so it didn't go to any specific grave not at the moment
5757780	5761460	do you think it was mad at us that sound do you think that's the sound of it leaving or do you
5761460	5767460	think it was like i think i think you're projecting i think i think ghosts make weird scary sounds
5767460	5772740	that's that's that's what ghosts do i think you know you're being needlessly you know
5773620	5778260	oh at the same time don is starting to break you've been up all night i go over and read
5778260	5783140	the uh the names on the graves uh i think those are the freshest ones all right uh the freshest
5783220	5792580	ones um the freshest ones are are are okay ving reams blazen bazen and archer fell those
5792580	5797620	are the three graves that seem freshest guys we need to focus on this ving reams character
5799780	5805940	who who was the second one recently died by the way like within a month well i don't know
5806740	5810660	who was the second name after after ving reams before archer blazen bazen
5813460	5820100	he was related to jerry lewis i think oh i thought like jeff leopard write songs about him
5823300	5831940	okay um i um i think we might want to examine the grave of archer and maybe see how he died
5831940	5838100	sure do some forensics should i take my shovel out and well oh yeah you have a shovel sorry well
5838740	5843460	before we do that because i mean we're i feel like we're we're in the black with the family
5844020	5850580	you know like yeah let's just read the headstone it's a regular headstone yeah it says archer fell
5850580	5854820	that's all it's regular yeah all right dig it up
5857860	5863700	dig it up look i just want to i want to do right by you guys you know i sometimes i might suggest
5863700	5868020	a stupid thing you just got to tell me all right i'm gonna dig up this grave though
5869380	5877700	uh i take out my foldable shovel fold it out start digging all right um okay yeah wait
5878980	5886900	yeah great you dig a hole in the ground you dig and you dig and you find you find the coffin
5886900	5893620	the wooden cheap coffin the coffin of a peasant it has it has uh what do you call it like you see
5893860	5901060	slightly curved scuff marks divots on it like uh like things have been hitting the outside of
5901060	5908820	of the coffin recently do do you see those mark i mean is that normal marks for
5908820	5913620	when you put the would describe the marks again sorry they seem like shovel marks
5916260	5923300	okay i compare the shovel head of diarrhea junior shoveled it matches up perfect no um
5923300	5928500	no it's just it's just it's a different shovel it's a more a more worksman shovel um steve's
5928500	5934180	shovel is like a little trenching shovel it's kind of like a little compact it's i'm sure he
5937060	5942100	yeah but it lets him achieve great speeds yeah i'm sure you use it very well uh
5943620	5950580	the the the but that's important i mean this is a we're we just exhumed a we're re-exuming a grave
5950580	5956900	yeah that's data i it's it's not open though right uh the the colors well it's your it's it's
5956900	5961620	mostly still covered you're just seeing like it'll take some work if you want to get the coffin out
5961620	5966180	of the ground we all i start helping dig around and uh get the coffin all right well what's your
5966180	5969780	goal do you want to get the coffin out of the ground or just into an openable state or what
5969780	5976900	are you trying to do openable state okay all right you do that you get the lip lid off and you notice
5976900	5982820	that most of the nails are gone and inside you just see the corpse of a dog it's like a rotting
5982820	5994180	dog what this is fucked up i i call out to the to archer if archer's spirit is still present
5995140	6002420	archer are you here you get no response all right oh at this point it's like say about eight in the
6002420	6009540	morning it's passed on because it takes a while to dig up a grave guys it takes a community to
6010580	6012020	what no that's just because that's all
6014180	6015860	it takes a rick and a morty
6018180	6025940	for six seasons we have it i i it takes i i i'm gonna cut to the end only great minds
6025940	6033700	what i'm gonna say it's it's morning uh i think we should we should cover this back up as quickly
6033700	6039780	as possible and and and because we're the rest of our mission is going to have to do with finding
6039780	6044500	facts from people that might not be willing to talk to us right okay i i just examine the dog
6044500	6048580	and the rest of the coffin to see if there's any thing interesting on the like like like i did
6048580	6054660	like a collar identifying it or anything like that uh no nothing on the dog or anything nothing
6054660	6060260	else in the coffin besides the corpse of the dog no there's nothing like remaining it it just seems
6060260	6064740	kind of like it was disturbed a little bit yeah so they they took this body out for some nefarious
6064740	6070340	magic and left a dog in its place how old i mean how long do you think this dog has been buried here
6071300	6076580	the dog seems like it's been rotting for a while like it seems mostly decayed like it was decaying
6076580	6081860	before they tossed it in there's another scenario that involves two exhumations the second being
6081860	6087940	ours is that the dog was put in the coffin for weight it was part of a fake funeral the boy was
6087940	6099300	never in it and then girl the girl um i don't see gender the the uh and that uh either the family or
6099300	6105860	maybe the other family that was burnt to death or who knows like got suspicious dug it up found out
6105860	6111460	the truth paid for it with their life i mean there's that scenario too should we dig up
6111460	6118580	ving rams or i think i think you're right you want to go ahead into town this morning
6119380	6126340	yeah well let's let's put the diarrhea rebury this coffin okay we can probably all chip in
6126900	6131060	you know many hands make a quick i don't have any moved dirt spells
6132980	6135220	that's okay why don't you cast use hands
6135220	6146020	i start burying the dog again i help all right all right yeah i cast detect high road
6148660	6154740	uh i i help too it's an opportunity to i believe that uh strenuous labor
6156020	6163700	is a punishment that will make me a purer you believe that all right you do the thing
6163700	6168980	it's buried it's uh it looks pretty fresh but what are you going to do right i think i'm going
6168980	6174340	to make it look a little fresher uh maybe put some pitchforks on the okay
6177220	6184260	is this my references are yeah i i just i just need to die is that the pitchforks
6184260	6190340	a straight reference yeah the idea of freshness as urban culture from the 80s right that's that's
6190340	6195060	a pretty deep cut yeah all right let's head let's head into town and start asking some questions
6195060	6201220	you guys maybe uh get something to eat we haven't eaten i know and we just did a lot of calorie
6201220	6206260	burning uh reburying that dead dog why don't we go back get our get our wagon take it into town
6206820	6211620	is that our euphemism for eating oh we have an actual wagon we had our wagon that we just left
6211620	6217300	yeah you hit it you hit it somewhere on the fell farm or near the fell farm before you first went
6217300	6221220	back at the farm kind of crazy walk back get in the wagon then ride back to where we are but
6221220	6224260	they're going to find our wagon and they go fuck this wagon these guys are assholes they're gonna
6224260	6229300	fuck up our wagon town fells gonna fuck up our wagon what why why take the body of a dead child
6230020	6231220	oh steve we're hungry
6237060	6242340	how far a walk is it into town uh yeah a couple minutes you're pretty close it's a small town
6242340	6247460	can i answer that question given that as a cleric i am like the bulk of my skills are
6247460	6253220	knowledge categories one of which is knowledge of arcana you know like do i have an answer to that
6253220	6261300	question what what would you typically do assuming necromancy uh possibly with a dead kid like like
6261300	6268900	why would you want a dead kid um okay what are they good for what's your what's your knowledge
6268900	6274260	arcana or knowledge religion oh well it's just checked off i don't it would be uh what's your
6274260	6280740	wisdom might well knowledge uh arcana it would be intelligence that's what it says okay what's your
6280740	6290580	intelligence uh seven ooh necromance so it's so i don't really have knowledge of our can
6291220	6298580	yeah i do i've got a plus four arcana knowledge okay well and i have a uh i have
6299300	6302740	uh what's my intelligence i have a 16 intelligence too so
6304180	6310420	why don't you ask why don't you take five uh because i don't know what five is
6311860	6318100	i'll just i'll take a bunch what were those numbers again jeff uh 16 intelligence and a
6318100	6326900	plus four knowledge arcana okay all right um dan you realize that necromancy is a branch of magic
6326900	6341220	involving death um jeff you realize that the flesh of the living especially of innocence can
6341220	6348260	be used as a powerful magical reagent the what of the of the youthful what just the flesh okay oh
6348260	6352740	only the flesh yeah i mean dan i mean carlos you did real good there by the way by the
6353380	6361220	makeup job uh but sometimes they use the flesh of the of children it's a very powerful magical
6361220	6368660	agent so they might be using that for some of their spells that's brutal who it's enough to

6398500	6402740	well certainly not dog
6404900	6414020	it's in the way that you use it all right um the town is not like it's not like a big town it's
6414020	6419220	like it's literally like six or seven buildings you see a building that looks kind of like a half
6419220	6424580	dome like made out of clay you see a couple buildings that just look like little small
6424580	6429940	wooden buildings one of them has two stories the other one has one story you see like uh the one
6429940	6434740	story building has a little garden outside of it and then there's just two more regular looking
6434740	6441620	homes um and then another farmhouse other than toms and then there's the church so and then there's
6441620	6448500	a big concrete building with a giant fiberglass hot dog on top yeah the kfc uh so there's no
6448500	6461140	signage that would indicate like uh inns taverns hotels bistros boutiques charcuterie je ne sais quoi
6462740	6463380	systematic
6469300	6471220	been waiting for a half hour to say that
6471380	6478580	all right there's not a lot of signs but as you enter you kind of walk towards the center of town
6478580	6483220	which is like a little hill you see the one of the only signs you've seen so far which is a sign
6483220	6489060	that just says dairy hill and uh there's like a tree on the top of the hill and you see a a woman
6489060	6495220	kind of just standing around um just looking around and then she sits on the ground except
6495220	6505140	then she sees you so she stands back up okay maybe she has some cheese what dairy
6506660	6515380	oh it's spelled d-e-r-r-y oh uh all right well let's she probably knows good spots for breakfast
6515380	6522660	we should go up there to dairy hill yeah uh you who i don't say you who oh you
6525460	6530260	yeah uh carlos you're kind of the mouthpiece why don't you uh go make make her her acquaintance
6530260	6538820	all right young woman hey hey you're you're new here right who are you you look churchly
6540660	6548020	i'm carlos the unimaginative and the inarticulate um i uh i'm from the church of the silver flame
6548020	6558500	yes i'm new here you have me at an advantage hmm i'm ronda you're right rida ronda ronda of the watch
6560820	6561780	what do you keep watch
6564180	6573060	over the town someone's got to do it what do you watch for trouble seen any well lately
6573780	6582340	no just recently there's been a lot of livestock's being mutilated and murdered like three or four
6582340	6588180	cows by now it's been ramping up it's pretty it's it's a lot you know you lose a cow that's almost
6588180	6592180	you know your whole livelihood we passed a couple cows and an old guy out in the field
6592180	6597220	recently those those cows seem to be doing all right yeah
6597940	6605220	uh any any dogs missing
6610260	6614500	not that i can think of but i don't really keep track there's just you know wild dogs sometimes
6614500	6621460	coming in out of town they're sure they're real trouble so you're not a watchdog no i do watch
6621540	6628180	dogs you do watch that oh i thought you never mind i uh i go back to where i was standing
6628180	6633380	before i walked up and said that so livestock gone missing huh we'll be
6633380	6641220	immutilated we we found it oh can you take me to some of them oh yeah she takes you to tom felds
6641220	6648340	farm oh shit scene of the crime they're not going to give us any food here
6648340	6656660	you know i i i thought i would have stopped her halfway through this journey but here we are
6656660	6660980	just kind of like a lost in thought and you don't have to we don't you could stop we don't have to
6660980	6666180	go all the way are you taking us to tom felds farm all right yeah i was i say we were doing
6666180	6675540	that right before we leave uh so is the bulk of the uh strangeness happening at tom felds farm
6675620	6680900	well i'd say maybe half of the cows that are killed were his but that's because we basically
6680900	6692740	have two farmers who's the other farmer uh donovan manil where does he live over there
6694260	6701300	do they have a business rivalry uh yeah i guess i i didn't really thought about it to be honest
6701460	6708340	but they must i mean they can't be price fixing that would be a violation of antitrust legislation
6711140	6718420	they're supposed to compete with each other unlike airlines who who makes a better breakfast burrito
6718420	6726900	because carlos he loves those breakfast burritos hmm um well we don't really do food service here
6727860	6734580	like i got some cheese you want some cheese we'll eat that while you take us to darren mclaren's
6734580	6741140	uh farm donovan who he means donovan manil manil of course
6746340	6748260	yeah you wrote down that strap on site too
6748740	6760340	all right uh the manil house is is pretty pretty close it's right there you're right there uh i
6760340	6765940	think we've given we've given the fell family enough business for one for one 24 hour period
6765940	6772500	let's let's go to donovan's house donovan answers the door he seems to be in a weird mood he's like
6772500	6778740	what do you guys want i'm busy here to help with your cattle problem oh it's not my problem
6778740	6787300	that's just the life of a farmer my man word around town is your cattle problems are nothing
6787300	6796020	normal at all well normal normal is what you make of it in a world with ghosts and demons and
6796020	6800900	monsters and stuff like cattle mutilations are shitty but it's just part of being a farmer i
6800900	6806260	mean i lost a couple cattle here there but you don't see me making a big stink of it not like
6806260	6813140	tom fell bitching and moaning like his kid getting sick some big deal kids get sick my kid got sick

6818900	6828820	mutilate your cows what no probably not i mean well let's just say no i mean i guess it's time
6828900	6835140	to sense motive um you sense that he doesn't like tom
6840820	6847940	i i i try my sense motive on him as well what's your uh perception perception which is wisdom
