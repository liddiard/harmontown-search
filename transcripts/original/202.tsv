0	14000	Welcome to Meltdown Comics, we're at Melt-Peter-Harmon Town, it's now in session.
14000	26000	Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden.
26000	36000	Who has been demoted from his comptroller role from last week.
36000	38000	Oh, I'm right in high, Jeff.
38000	40000	I heard you tried to usurp my throne.
40000	42000	I feel like a kid for a moment.
42000	46000	How about the mayor of Harmon Town, Mr. Dan Harmon?
46000	60000	Thank you, thank you.
60000	62000	Alright, yeah.
62000	64000	You left me hanging with a high five over here, man.
64000	66000	Oh shit, I didn't, you know, I'm out of it, man.
66000	72000	I've been up all night, I gotta go back to work after this, fucking running on chewable Adderalls.
72000	78000	You know they're not chewables, you're just chewing on them.
78000	82000	They seem pretty chewable to me.
82000	86000	Any pill is chewable if you really put your heart into it.
86000	90000	Anything is chewable if you really put your heart into it.
90000	92000	Diamonds? I guess so.
92000	94000	If you really put your heart into it.
94000	96000	You'd have to have teeth made of stronger diamonds.
96000	102000	There's no part of the word chew that implies success.
102000	104000	Like you could chew a locomotive.
104000	108000	Yeah, you just want to get very far.
108000	116000	Or does it imply that your jaws go all the way together and you do like a rotating mastication motion?
116000	118000	Otherwise is it just biting?
118000	123000	I think chewing implies something's being accomplished by your biting.
123000	129000	I think chew certainly more than bite does imply success, I was wrong.
129000	133000	Chew is like a bite plus.
133000	137000	It's like a prestige bite.
137000	139000	I listened to last week.
145000	149000	Hot under the collar over here.
149000	151000	Oh boy.
151000	157000	I did like the pitch that when Spencer Prestige is he becomes a comptroller and I become Bud Friedman.
157000	159000	And I just stand in the back and let people know.
159000	161000	I thought you liked that.
161000	165000	Yeah, you'll eventually, we'll go from performing at Nerdmelt to Jeffmelt.
165000	167000	I love that.
167000	171000	There'll be little jackets, I'll hand out like Bud Friedman.
171000	175000	It's a great episode, it's last week and go check it out.
175000	178000	It sounded hot as blazes so I'm glad I missed that.
178000	182000	I think it's been a bit of a cooker.
182000	188000	Or is that just the friction from the UK leaving the EU?
188000	190000	Oh shit, oh shit.
190000	191000	Brexit?
191000	193000	I love when you worked topical.
193000	194000	Brexit.
194000	198000	I was in London for a couple weeks which was a great time.
198000	199000	Loads of Armenians.
199000	201000	You were there for the Brexit?
201000	207000	I was there, I exited Britain before Britain exited the EU.
207000	210000	But first of all...
210000	213000	Because if you had exited just as they were exiting,
213000	218000	I wonder if you would have gone faster than the speed of light.
218000	223000	I think the real bummer, I mean I'm sure there's lots of bummers,
223000	227000	but the big bummer for me is that I think I got paid in pounds
227000	233000	and I don't think I've been paid yet so I think I just lost a few thousand dollars.
233000	234000	Yeah.
234000	237000	Don't cry for me Argentina.
237000	241000	But you get into a cab, I would get into taxis and I would talk to the drivers
241000	244000	and I'd say, hey, will you leave her, your remainder?
244000	250000	And they'd go, yeah, look Mike, you know, I'm not racist but...
250000	252000	You've got these fucking pakies coming in.
252000	254000	They're like, wow, yeah.
254000	258000	Ain't no racism like a London cabbie racist.
258000	261000	I mean, oh God, I don't even...
261000	267000	There's a part of my brain that's like, how does the EU...
267000	270000	Okay, all right.
270000	273000	What problems did he solve?
273000	276000	But you know, there was a little bit of silver lining there
276000	280000	because we didn't feel like the kind of like...
280000	284000	It was kind of like when the Chevy Chase thing was going on,
284000	286000	and how I felt when one of the...
286000	290000	I think one of the palins had an illegitimate kid or something like that
290000	291000	for like a couple days.
291000	293000	I was like, whew.
293000	295000	But then it was right back to the Chevy Chase voicemail.
295000	298000	But I just felt like with the whole Trump thing,
298000	303000	like the Brexit was sort of like America got to kind of take a weekend
303000	307000	and just do bits about the United Kingdom for a while.
307000	309000	There's an article I think in The New Yorker
309000	312000	with a tongue lightly in its cheek saying that
312000	317000	the UK has lost its moral high ground on America as stupid.
317000	319000	They've lost that bit.
319000	320000	Yeah.
320000	325000	However, we're going to reclaim that in November, I think?
325000	327000	No.
327000	328000	No, we are.
328000	329000	We are.
329000	333000	Because our smart friends, our smart cousins are stupid too.
333000	335000	We have to prove that we're more stupid than them
335000	337000	because we fucking are.
337000	338000	It's going to be bad.
338000	339000	No.
339000	340000	It's not a competition.
340000	341000	We'll be fine.
341000	345000	None of it really matters, right?
345000	348000	It just proves that people don't vote intellectually anymore.
348000	351000	They vote emotionally and they listen to sound bites.
351000	352000	They don't listen to information.
352000	354000	They don't even know what the EU is.
354000	357000	It's nuts.
357000	359000	The number one Google search the day after was,
359000	360000	what is the EU?
360000	362000	What did I just vote for?
362000	364000	They thought they were being protesters.
364000	366000	They thought they were going to go, oh yeah,
366000	368000	40% of us said fuck this shit.
368000	370000	No, 60% of you said fuck this shit.
370000	372000	Or 51% or whatever.
372000	376000	They didn't realize that they actually were part of a movement.
376000	379000	Meaning the stupidity movement.
379000	385000	Well, I mean, thanks for the language.
385000	387000	To our friends over there.
387000	388000	I don't know.
388000	391000	I'm trying to put a, just make me feel better.
391000	393000	Yes, thanks for the language.
393000	395000	But they call the second floor the first floor.
395000	397000	That never stops being confusing.
397000	399000	What do they call the first floor?
399000	401000	The lobby.
401000	403000	The fucking minus what floor?
403000	404000	I don't know.
404000	407000	Well, we do that in a hotel though.
407000	411000	First floor is, you're up a floor.
411000	413000	You're looking out the window down at the street
413000	415000	and you're on the first floor.
415000	418000	Yeah, like a Holiday Inn.
418000	420000	Yeah, it's the L, you press the L button
420000	422000	and then you go up to the first floor.
422000	424000	It works like that a lot of places.
424000	425000	It's fucked up.
425000	427000	Don't get me wrong.
427000	429000	Are you fucking kidding me?
429000	434000	You've never seen an elevator that has an L at the bottom floor?
434000	436000	The second floor is floor one.
436000	438000	It's fucked up.
438000	441000	You guys are fucking, whoever's calling out back there,
441000	444000	just do not see elevators as much as me.
444000	447000	Are you just mad because you're not at the podium this week?
447000	450000	Oh, let me, don't even get me started, man.
450000	452000	You had bits, you had written down material?
452000	454000	Yeah, I didn't have a suit though.
454000	456000	I know, it was a shame.
456000	458000	I really get confused in the parking garage elevators.
458000	462000	It says G and then P and then there's an L and a B
462000	465000	and like, give a brother a number.
465000	467000	All right.
467000	469000	All right, that's...
469000	470000	We solved that.
470000	471000	Yeah.
471000	472000	We solved that.
472000	476000	Okay, so that was the cold open of the show.
476000	479000	A little colder than usual.
479000	481000	But let's heat things up with some guests.
481000	483000	We got to bring them out like a bullet train,
483000	485000	but I also don't want them to all compete with each other,
485000	487000	so let's bring them out one at a time.
487000	488000	All right.
488000	491000	So let's, let's, we're splitting out
491000	494000	to keep the international business going.
494000	496000	Let's bring out your Kiwi friend.
496000	497000	My friend too.
497000	498000	You're a Kiwi friend too.
498000	500000	Yeah.
500000	502000	But I met him through you.
502000	504000	He's your friend too.
504000	505000	Yeah.
505000	507000	He's sexy.
507000	510000	He's too good looking is my problem with this guy.
510000	512000	I think that we, like, he's just,
512000	514000	he just is that kind of good looking
514000	517000	that it's a little bit, it's a little bit of a distraction.
517000	520000	For the fact that he's a great, he's a great actor
520000	522000	and he plays a vampire on television.
522000	524000	Let's bring out Daniel Gillies.
524000	526000	Daniel Gillies!
537000	539000	Hello Daniel.
541000	542000	Hey.
542000	543000	Hello.
543000	544000	Also, your beard, Daniel.
544000	545000	I just, I just kissed you in the cheek.
545000	546000	Your beard smells great.
546000	548000	Did you put cologne in your beard?
548000	550000	Or is that, is that...
550000	553000	I might have put a little cologne in my beard.
553000	556000	It's Chanel bleh.
556000	558000	So you just got picked up for your fourth season
558000	560000	of the originals.
560000	563000	Whoo!
563000	565000	Which is a spin-off of Vampire Diaries.
565000	566000	Bleh.
567000	569000	This is like, this is like the tenth year
569000	571000	of the Vampire Diaries started
571000	573000	right next to the community.
573000	575000	They were in the same time slot.
575000	577000	We were little, little sister shows.
577000	580000	Now it's still chugging along and it's got a kid of its own.
580000	581000	Yeah.
581000	583000	We're doing a half season this time.
583000	585000	We're doing, we're only doing 13
585000	587000	so I can actually see my family now.
587000	590000	What kind of stuff happens in a serialized,
590000	593000	I'm assuming it's serialized, it's not like...
593000	594000	Yes.
594000	595000	Yeah.
595000	598000	I don't know what the alternative would be.
598000	602000	What, like, after 10 years of vampire storylines,
602000	607000	what is, what remains to be resolved?
607000	611000	Why isn't the town that they're in
611000	614000	either fully vampire or...
614000	617000	It seems like an untenable conflict.
617000	620000	I never watched the, what was it called,
620000	624000	Blood Simple, Blood Man, Blood People?
624000	627000	True Blood.
627000	629000	That was like the most popular one,
629000	632000	like at the height of a, I'm just,
632000	635000	I'm not letting you answer the question.
635000	636000	I don't know if it...
636000	638000	This is just fascinating.
638000	640000	Just like, like on your show.
640000	642000	All right, well let's start with...
642000	645000	I want to hear your pitch on Blood People.
645000	648000	Dude, pitch me Blood People.
648000	654000	Sano, Sano-Wano has all the right moves.
654000	657000	Child, if you want meth, you want sex,
657000	659000	you want a brand new trailer,
659000	661000	you gotta come on down here.
661000	666000	Oh, and all the wrong things.
666000	669000	Oh, girl, give me another champagne.
669000	672000	But what it doesn't know it has
672000	677000	is a little bit of a vampire problem.
678000	687000	Shit, what the fuck?
687000	689000	What?
689000	690000	Wednesdays.
690000	692000	Are the vampires the blood people
692000	694000	or are the townspeople the blood people
694000	696000	because they have the blood that feeds the vampires?
696000	698000	Well, I think as the mayor says in the pilot,
698000	701000	he goes, look, we gotta fucking hold it together.
701000	704000	Because what happens is while the vampires
704000	707000	and the people that are fighting,
707000	709000	the Brexit happens.
709000	711000	Or something like it.
711000	713000	It's like a Brexit analog.
713000	716000	And so the economy collapses.
716000	719000	And then the mayor in the third act of the pilot
719000	723000	says, look, vampires need blood.
723000	725000	People have blood.
725000	727000	No one wants to get bit by vampires.
727000	730000	Vampires don't want to run out of blood.
730000	732000	Look, we gotta stop thinking of ourselves
732000	733000	as vampires or people.
733000	735000	We gotta just start looking at this
735000	741000	as a town of blood people.
741000	745000	And then you never close your eyes.
745000	747000	And then the whole town's people,
747000	749000	kind of like the vampires.
749000	750000	Who do you cast as the mayor?
750000	751000	Who do you have in mind?
751000	753000	I'm thinking Tom Scarritt.
753000	754000	I was thinking of Tom Scarritt too.
754000	755000	For real?
755000	756000	Yeah.
756000	757000	What?
757000	759000	Is Tom Scarritt alive?
759000	762000	I think we'd know if Tom Scarritt had died, wouldn't we?
762000	765000	So somebody look that up.
765000	766000	Tom Scarritt's alive.
766000	768000	Chris Kristofferson is the fucking mayor.
768000	769000	Let's go with that.
769000	771000	He's close though, man.
771000	772000	He's close.
772000	773000	Really?
773000	774000	I think he's next.
774000	775000	Really?
775000	776000	Yeah.
776000	777000	What's it, Reynolds?
777000	778000	Huh?
778000	779000	Is that terrible to say?
779000	780000	What?
780000	781000	You're gonna kill Burt Reynolds first?
781000	783000	I'm gonna kill Burt Reynolds.
783000	784000	After this.
784000	786000	I need a couple more of these.
786000	788000	You took time out of your Burt Reynolds assassination
788000	790000	to come here into Hummertown?
790000	792000	That is what I call generosity.
792000	793000	You're in the middle.
793000	795000	You're in the middle of assassinating Burt Reynolds.
795000	797000	You got the job already.
797000	798000	This is beautiful.
798000	802000	And you're stopping here and now you're gonna go kill Burt Reynolds.
802000	803000	All right.
803000	804000	Scarritt's alive.
804000	805000	Say what?
805000	806000	Scarritt's alive.
806000	807000	Scarritt's alive.
807000	808000	All right.
808000	809000	Let's get him then.
809000	812000	Daniel, how many times has your character been killed, brought back to life?
812000	816000	Oh, somebody did a count of this the other day.
816000	818000	You're talking about exhausted narratives.
818000	821000	Yeah, it's...
821000	822000	Boy, is this a bone of contention.
822000	825000	I've got to tread carefully through this fucking minefield.
825000	826000	I want to have a job.
826000	830000	Hummertown is a safe place where you can say anything that you want about your show.
830000	831000	And there's no fallout at all.
831000	832000	There's no fallout at all.
832000	834000	Yeah, yeah, perfect.
834000	835000	Eleven, I think.
835000	836000	I believe it's eleven.
836000	837000	It might be fourteen.
837000	840000	Eleven means you've gotten a stake through the heart eleven times?
840000	842000	Yeah, that's right.
842000	850000	So in addition to normal can't kill you-ness, you also are a vampire that can't be killed.
850000	851000	To just count be killed.
851000	852000	It's relentless.
852000	853000	It's like, yeah.
853000	857000	Well, can he not be killed, or is it magic that's bringing you back?
857000	860000	Are other wizards invoking their will upon you?
860000	863000	Or is that like they miss your heart?
863000	865000	I didn't even know Spencer was here.
865000	866000	Yeah.
866000	868000	He's so fucking beautiful.
868000	869000	Oh, thanks.
869000	870000	I love it.
870000	872000	It's just like, oh, Eclipse.
872000	873000	There we go.
873000	877000	And this is, he's the Karl Pilkington in the outfit.
877000	878000	I love this.
878000	879000	No, I mean that lovingly.
879000	880000	I mean that lovingly.
880000	881000	Come on.
881000	883000	Yeah, everybody comes for Karl Pilkington.
883000	884000	Hey, hey, hey.
884000	885000	Hey.
885000	886000	No, that's true.
886000	887000	They do.
887000	888000	The first season of what was that thing called?
888000	889000	I don't care.
889000	891000	The Ricky Gervais thing?
891000	892000	Come on.
892000	893000	The Talker Brothers.
893000	894000	Nope.
894000	896000	The Idiot Abroad or the cartoon one?
896000	897000	No, no, no.
897000	898000	The one he did, Derek.
898000	899000	Derek.
899000	900000	Derek.
900000	901000	He was in the first season there.
901000	902000	He was fabulous.
902000	903000	Anyway, nice to see you, Spencer.
903000	904000	It's good to see you, too.
904000	905000	Sorry, what were you fucking talking about?
905000	906000	We're dying.
906000	907000	We're coming back.
907000	908000	You can't die even though you're a vampire that has-
908000	909000	No, I can't die.
909000	910000	That has death rules.
910000	911000	That's right.
911000	913000	Are you enjoying it still?
913000	914000	You forbade me to watch it.
914000	915000	You said, Jif.
915000	916000	Well, I don't-
916000	917000	I love the way-
917000	918000	Jif.
918000	919000	Jif.
919000	920000	I love the way that's my accent.
920000	921000	Here it comes.
921000	923000	If you fucking watch it, we're not fucking friends anymore, man.
923000	924000	That's true.
924000	925000	You forbade me.
925000	926000	I've held to that.
926000	928000	I don't have watched it anyway, but you-
928000	929000	It's true.
929000	930000	It's true.
930000	934000	But you gave me permission to not watch it because I'm a good friend of yours.
934000	938000	All right, we should bring up more of our friends.
938000	940000	Duncan Trussell's here.
953000	955000	Is this the sexiest show we've done yet?
955000	957000	It's already the sexiest bunch of men on stage.
957000	958000	Get at it.
958000	959000	Now you're being sarcastic.
959000	960000	No, because you're gorgeous.
960000	962000	You're sitting next to a sexy vampire.
962000	963000	This guy is-
963000	964000	No, he's-
964000	965000	It's a metric.
965000	966000	No, Daniel's-
966000	967000	Let's not.
967000	968000	Let's not.
968000	969000	Continue.
969000	970000	Do you have beard cologne too, Duncan?
970000	972000	Are you one of those guys?
972000	974000	Yeah, gravy.
976000	977000	It's true.
977000	978000	Duncan, treat yourself.
978000	982000	Lean over and just take a little smell of Daniel's beard.
982000	985000	Oh my God, it's amazing.
985000	987000	How did you know that?
987000	992000	I gave him a friendly kiss on the cheek and I went to an astral plane.
992000	993000	Yeah.
993000	994000	No, wait.
994000	995000	I was going to say-
995000	996000	He said astral plane.
996000	998000	This is a really obscure reference.
998000	999000	I was going to-
999000	1005000	What is that Stephen King book that he wrote with another horror movie writer where-
1005000	1006000	The Talisman.
1006000	1008000	And you know, for those of you that-
1008000	1013000	So basically you drink this shitty vomit tasting stuff and you transport it into another dimension
1013000	1018000	where everything smells the way it's supposed to smell as opposed to-
1018000	1023000	Anyway, your beard smells like the right way beard should smell.
1025000	1028000	You can all smell it after the show.
1029000	1032000	Daniel and Elizabeth are doing a beard sniffing after the show.
1032000	1034000	It's only 12 dollars.
1034000	1039000	I hope that you guys aren't flagged by my flagging energy.
1039000	1042000	I've just been up all night.
1042000	1050000	It's hard to come do a show and then you're realizing people are relying on you for joie de vivre.
1050000	1058000	You just kind of stand outside yourself and you realize you've been hunched over and speaking in a monotone.
1058000	1061000	I have no- I'm desiccated.
1061000	1062000	Are you sleeping at all?
1062000	1063000	What's your-
1063000	1066000	I've been up all night because I'm a shitty, shitty writer.
1066000	1068000	A terrible shitty person.
1068000	1070000	Shut up.
1071000	1072000	You don't know-
1072000	1073000	Let him continue, Jesus.
1073000	1075000	You only see it when it's done.
1075000	1079000	If you saw the amount of masturbating and the amount of like-
1079000	1081000	It's just so fucking sad.
1081000	1084000	I'm not a shitty writer means oh he wrote a bad thing.
1084000	1088000	I'm saying like I'm a bad naughty boy.
1089000	1092000	Like I'm a- I'm not a professional-
1092000	1097000	I'm really just really like I'll be handed opportunities that are like absolutely fantastic
1097000	1101000	and easy to knock out and fun and something I'm passionate about.
1101000	1108000	And then the minute that it enters a zone of like oh you know there'd be no way to fuck this up
1108000	1111000	or you know it's like I'll just figure out how.
1111000	1118000	Because you got the book, you have 9,000 TV shows, you got a million deals, pitches going on.
1118000	1122000	How do you even organize your time between all those things?
1122000	1125000	I just let Steve Levy do it.
1125000	1127000	Actually I have another question.
1127000	1130000	What's your version of this all working?
1130000	1132000	Well that's the sad thing.
1132000	1135000	I'm talking to my therapist about it is that I've never had a version where it's like work.
1135000	1137000	This is how I've always worked.
1137000	1142000	Like in terms of having the right original stuff, but it's been a while
1142000	1146000	because the community taught me how to work with people
1146000	1148000	and on a thing that needed to get done.
1148000	1153000	And when there's like a lot of people involved you can't fuck up that much.
1153000	1160000	But when it gets down to like oh this is up to me to do a thing on and no one's around to yell at me.
1160000	1164000	So it's like I'll just like it's just kind of amazing.
1164000	1168000	But I don't know and my therapist said she said you're-
1168000	1171000	oh let's bring out Camille Nagiani we should do that.
1171000	1173000	Whoo!
1173000	1175000	What the-
1175000	1178000	The show is already sexy.
1190000	1191000	Hello.
1191000	1192000	Hello.
1192000	1195000	Are we starting a sexy calendar? What's going on?
1195000	1196000	I know.
1196000	1202000	There's not a lot of gender balance on stage but I don't think the ladies will be complaining.
1202000	1206000	I mean we all look fine but if you had to guess who's playing a vampire on TV.
1210000	1212000	It's very easy.
1212000	1216000	It's still so bitter that I got December in the calendar.
1216000	1219000	Yeah you gotta close it out strong.
1219000	1224000	What month would you be in a sexy hunky comedians of calendar?
1224000	1227000	What a horrible idea.
1227000	1229000	I'm saying you had to do it.
1229000	1231000	I have to do it.
1232000	1236000	It's something that you made some sort of terrible deal in part of the contract.
1236000	1238000	Who else is in the calendar?
1238000	1242000	Duncan Trussell, Daniel Gillies, me, Spencer and Dan.
1242000	1245000	And then who else?
1245000	1247000	We each got two months.
1249000	1253000	We each get a holiday month and like a freestyle month.
1253000	1254000	Yeah.
1254000	1258000	Because like you get December you know it's like fuck man.
1258000	1261000	Then you get September with color palettes spoken for.
1261000	1264000	Do I have to take a bullshit month because I got December?
1264000	1269000	I didn't realize that there was a month people wanted in those kinds of camps.
1269000	1273000	Well you don't want February because that's the feelest day.
1273000	1276000	I think you want September.
1276000	1277000	I want September.
1277000	1279000	September 11th.
1279000	1282000	Well that's not going to be part of the photo.
1282000	1283000	That's why you want it?
1283000	1284000	You don't want that.
1284000	1286000	Oh yeah you don't want that.
1286000	1288000	I thought you were like give me September 11th.
1288000	1290000	I was thinking pile of leaves.
1290000	1296000	But I guess in the background there could be like a shadow.
1296000	1297000	Yeah.
1297000	1301000	Whoever it is is dressed as a firefighter.
1301000	1308000	It's like you're in a pile of leaves in a swimsuit and you've got your glasses on the bridge of your nose.
1308000	1310000	But if you like zoom in.
1310000	1312000	Oh the reflection.
1312000	1319000	The reflection in your pupil is like.
1319000	1322000	Not cool dude.
1322000	1323000	I don't know.
1323000	1329000	To me it's a tragic event.
1329000	1332000	Wow what a stand to take.
1332000	1334000	Wow you really put yourself out there.
1334000	1336000	What a bullshit.
1336000	1338000	Trump kind of wiped it out of me.
1338000	1347000	Do you find yourself as a liberal guy on the internet kind of like or just in regular life.
1347000	1352000	Do you find yourself kind of like going to that muscle that you used to use to be like.
1352000	1355000	Of course I didn't mean to.
1355000	1360000	Like when you're like when you're making sure you're speaking correctly and stuff.
1360000	1362000	Do you ever feel like a muscle rip.
1362000	1375000	It's good to just let that muscle atrophy and whatever comes out comes out and if you get it because I know I know as most of us here know that Trump is going to be exactly what this country needs.
1375000	1380000	And I'm not afraid of saying it anymore.
1380000	1387000	I think it's good to just let it I think it's good to let it come out and if you get a sailed or attacked for it or whatever you know that's the thing man.
1387000	1400000	You taught me this thing that just stuck in my head and the more I think the more I think about the more I think that pretty much sums it all up which is just say tell the truth how you feel right then in the moment.
1400000	1412000	Let it come out if that's who you are and someone gets angry at you for that thing then I think you said it to me it's like they're angry at nature and that you know they're angry at the wind or something.
1412000	1417000	Wait are you actually I haven't seen you in a little while are you actually supporting Trump.
1417000	1419000	No.
1419000	1424000	I was like oh my god there's gonna be words supporting Trump.
1424000	1436000	Yeah well no I mean no I know that's no people always say it's like oh he always speaks his mind well so do children and we don't make them president be a great movie.
1436000	1442000	Yeah yeah but he doesn't he doesn't speak his mind.
1442000	1444000	Let's let's let's not give right right right.
1444000	1450000	He's speaking like the mind of some weird simulation of Tom Cruise in his head.
1450000	1465000	Like he's just he's just saying like no I think all that I think all that like when I think that when you look at somebody who and I know a lot of people say he's in like maybe he's in a shit ton of debt or whatever but he does seem to have somehow manifested a lot of people.
1465000	1476000	He's invested a lot of massive skyscrapers and usually that indicates not some lunatic who just rambles but some kind of very manipulative person.
1476000	1492000	So I think part of his deception on one level is to seem just like some loose cannon or something like that when underneath it is just a classic all American huckster like the which is a really old American tradition.
1492000	1501000	It's the it's a it is like the old American con artist the guy who's like comes into town with a bunch of bullshit medicine gives it to people.
1501000	1505000	What.
1505000	1512000	Comes into town builds a monorail out of snake oil and then rides it away.
1512000	1519000	And then all the babies die from the exact he's like Robert Preston a music man without without the catchy tunes.
1519000	1527000	Yeah. Yeah. So I think people I think that the scary thing about him is not that he's like oh shit he's just a big baby.
1527000	1534000	It's the underneath the big baby is is a very very intelligent manipulative being.
1534000	1537000	I disagree. I don't see a very very intelligent guy.
1537000	1543000	Yeah. There's nothing in there which reflects to me anything but a complete emotional and intellectual immaturity.
1543000	1549000	I don't I don't sense anybody smart because I was kind of waiting for the guy behind the curtain.
1549000	1554000	You know I was waiting for the sort of the veneer to fall and I couldn't I can't see that.
1554000	1557000	I mean maybe I'm not smart enough to see how just how smart he is.
1557000	1561000	But you can't run for president and wear ball caps. No offense.
1561000	1564000	Duncan's wearing a ball cap but you're not running for president.
1564000	1567000	That's it. You're getting made. Yeah you're getting.
1567000	1574000	You can't. You can't. You can't wear a ball cap and stand behind a podium and run for president.
1574000	1578000	That's he's proving you can. Yeah he did it like do well.
1578000	1583000	I read it. I read an article about this. You guys. I read this article about the hair.
1583000	1593000	He wears the cap because his famously ridiculous hair that's always caught looking like fucking cotton candy you know on an autumn day.
1593000	1599000	It's he like someone told him it's like this can't be part of the campaign.
1599000	1606000	You have to take this out of the equation and the ball cap literally does that.
1606000	1610000	There's no more of these pictures of him getting out of airplanes where he looks like a fucking retard.
1610000	1619000	Oh I'm so sorry. Jesus Christ. I really flew out the handle there.
1620000	1624000	Spencer even read it we'll give you that one for free because you're talking about Trump.
1624000	1629000	His hair looks crazy. It doesn't look like someone who can touch their hair.
1629000	1644000	I think I think he's a he's a new breed of politician that has recognized a demographic in the world which is a demographic that maybe isn't the smartest demographic ever.
1644000	1653000	And they maybe. Yeah. And I'm trying to be. I don't want to be an. No they. I truly think that if you support Trump you're either stupid or evil.
1653000	1663000	Well I really think that. Or one of the blood people.
1663000	1671000	Well whatever whatever it may be like you know the there's the guy who's now going to be the prime minister in the UK where there's the famous video of him zip line.
1671000	1675000	He's got. Who's also got Trump hair. Yeah. They have their version of Trump.
1675000	1682000	I'm telling you you're looking you're looking at the new politician. It's all versions of this brand new kind of politician.
1682000	1696000	They all have crazy smoky orange hair and they figured out the car. You know like when you watch like resale furniture commercials or car commercials and the guys like tap dancing and he's like juggling in front of some cars.
1697000	1708000	Does that work. That can't work. But it must work because they keep doing it. It's the presidential political version of that where they figured out if I get in front of like a TV king.
1708000	1717000	Yeah. That's a mattress king. That's it. Yeah. That's what it is. He's a mattress king. They figured out that that works.
1717000	1734000	Fuck. But I still don't. I mean you're killing me you. Yeah. Well whatever. Anyways you can listen to a different podcast to find out that that guy's a bad idea for everybody.
1734000	1742000	But let's let me pick things up a notch with my energy.
1742000	1755000	How do you how do you how do you chew an Adderall and be this be this low energy. Well it's not his first Adderall. Yeah. It's been a while. All right. You want to take a look.
1755000	1761000	Then you can just lay down and take a little nap. Oh yeah. We'll take over the show. We have to Rosanna. I can't him with the fucking. Oh yeah. I'm done.
1762000	1772000	Needle that adrenaline needle. Yeah. All right. We can stake me for the 12 fucking time.
1772000	1788000	So who is who is who is staking you. Is it. I mean who gives this. Nobody gives this. Is your van Helsing another hunky guy. Or is it like an old. I mean I mean I'm putting this. I'm the old guy on the show.
1788000	1797000	I'm just I'm like are you the bad guy. You're a bad guy. I don't know. I don't think anybody can be really deemed good when they're sort of this murderous creature thing.
1797000	1810000	But I mean you know I got I'm already bored of hearing myself talking about this shit. Yes. I'm kind of a bad dude. But you're following me and my brothers shenanigans.
1810000	1836000	OK. And New Orleans. God it's boring. No sounds like I just haven't watched it but it's like no no. Have you read. Have you read the Anne Rice books. No I have not. They're man. They're great. And when you go to New Orleans that place seems like there should be vampires there. It would make sense that you'd run into vampires. That's a haunted city. Totally. Is is diaries based on an in race property. No it is not. All right.
1837000	1863000	I don't even know the name of the writer. Right. Right. Right. Thank you. You know what happened to me. I met Obama two days ago. This is the notch. The notch which Malia. Was he cool. No. Which one. The main guy. Oh really. Yeah. I met the Obama.
1864000	1882000	Where did it. Well tell us more. Why. OK. So there was a conference and it was a very serious conference and Barack Obama was going to speak at it and they were like which is a terrible idea. They were like Silicon Valley guys should go and do 10 minutes before like open for the president.
1883000	1903000	So it was we went on in this very serious conference where people from Rwanda and Jamaica have been talking about how they're trying to get entrepreneurship going in their countries. And we went on and tried to not say cunt. And did you tell the Pakistan porn tape a story. No. That's goody. It was it was chaos. No no no no no. And they were because they were like.
1904000	1924000	If you swear on stage you won't get to meet the president. That's literally what they told us. Why. So we didn't swear on stage and then we MTA. Do you think that's his rule. Like he said that I don't want to meet anyone who curses.
1924000	1952000	He doesn't give a fuck. Nobody. Did anybody really say that. Yes I swear. What. What. They should not have. Who. Who. What. What. What was the stage manager. No no. One of the organizers of the summit was like how did he say it. What was his exact context to. She said. Whoa. Whoa. Oh it's not bad that it's a she. No it's no. Just like you would assume that a summit could only be run by a dude.
1954000	1983980	Let's be honest. We're all curious to know whether or not it was a terrifying woman because because I want to know if she's representing the language because she's represented. Hey don't. She's there to say hey. You know she was she had authority and she said she talked about this and she's like oh and one more thing. If you swear on stage you won't get to meet the president. How did that get to be one more thing and not the first thing. I don't know. This was like two hours into the brief. The meeting that we had. Yeah. How organized was this.
1984000	2013980	Summit. Organized as fuck dude. Barack Obama was there. So she lays down the law. That's not like a harm in town. We're like let's see who shows up today. It's not like he texted him that day. Hey do you have room tonight. I'm going to stop by and blow your minds with a 20 minute speech. That's going to make you cry and laugh. And so we saw him speak and he gave this great. And he then he hosted a panel and then we met him afterward.
2014000	2043580	And he hadn't seen the show. He was like I'm sorry. I haven't seen the show. And I was like well you have a lot on your plate. And he said I'll binge it in six months. He did. For real. And then I kind of made a bad joke. I did a bad joke. I did a bad joke. So we met him and he was very nice. And then he was like he was like it's good. He was like funny people don't turn into shooters. That's what he said. Whoa. Wow. Wow. Wow.
2043580	2073580	No. But it got a huge laugh. Everybody's laughing. Well yeah. Everybody's laughing. I don't know. Sir Hunter on a pretty tight five. Yeah. I think it's just sad that the problem is that severe that he's thinking about. There's another like that. You were one of eight categories of people he met that day. Yeah. And one was a postal union or something and he was just
2073580	2103580	like it's good to be here. I gotta go. What was your joke. What did you say. He said funny people don't become shooters and everybody laughed. And I said but that doesn't mean that unfunny people are all shooters. And then it was like silent for five minutes. And he said yeah that's not what I meant. And I was like. And I was like I am so sorry. I'm going to go. My ears turn. And you
2103580	2133580	thought to yourself I should have said cunt on stage. This is never what I wanted all of them. And I saw him like cross Silicon Valley off his binge. The last ship went up one night. But he was he was very nice. Always wanted to see that last ship. I'm trying to I'm trying to do Obama. Is that what is that show about. Is it about like all the ships are gone and there's only one ship left. I really I honestly don't know
2133580	2163580	I think there's some kind of like there's there's explosions on the shore and there's a ship that says someone with a disease. I don't know disease and explosions. It's like a quarantine thing. It's a quarantine drama. Oh and then the ship is on the ocean and they're the only ones that they don't know what's happening. I think they're. Yeah. I think they can't go to land maybe. So that is how they pitched it. So it's so it's like it's maybe it's it's it's it's like Star Trek. But all
2163580	2193460	the aliens are sick people and space is really small and wet. And there's no hollow down. Hey you know what I'm bummed out didn't last more than four episodes doomsday preppers. There's only four episodes. Yeah because I talked to somebody that knew people that like producers on it that the first couple were actual people that doomsday prep.
2193860	2210500	The rest was completely just fabricate. They got actors like they just they got people to like they just found people. I bet I know like they would find people who go. Oh I hear you're kind of passionate about the polls reversing. Yeah I am. And yeah. Do you like macaroni.
2211900	2220340	Yeah I do. Would you be willing to hold these giant prop bags of macaroni and say we're we're you know when the polls shift I'm going to have all the macaroni I can eat.
2221260	2231340	Yeah that it turns out there's not three seasons worth of people that are awesomely prepping for the dooms or if they are or if they're legit they probably don't want to talk to a fucking new world order camera crew.
2233180	2247500	Hard to find that they're not like going on the lifetime networks need a website. The most impressive shit I saw the thing that I was like that's my doomsday jam was the shipping container thing where you you get a bunch of shipping containers.
2247740	2261900	They're super cheap. They're bullet proof. They're tornado proof. They're everything proof. I think they're even you know they're they're closer to being fallout proof if you then say I don't know a hat.
2264940	2274820	But they have doors. Yeah I know I'm not saying like run get in a shipping container if there's nuclear war and you're going to be fine. I just. They bury it. But you know they're better.
2275340	2285220	You can bury them and make a little make a little insta insta dungeon. I don't want to be a nigga. You can't just bury him though like. Well you got to cut like a hole in the top.
2285820	2302620	No like I I I got to tell you I've been looking this up since I was in high school and according to leading structural engineers you bury one of those things it crunches inwards like a can. It's not designed to store shit.
2303180	2313500	Wait you got to. Well you could do it. You just got to reinforce it and at that point just build a bunker. Oh man I'm not I'm not sitting inside anything that would crush like a can if it wasn't reinforced right.
2313980	2322300	But it's such a romantic idea. You know to be in a box under the fucking ground. It would be the best. I am. You're going to end up there. I.
2322300	2340300	That's all I want. I met John Goodman apparently. I met a guy who or I interviewed a guy who bought a limestone like the United States military hollowed out this massive I think it was a lime American psyche.
2340500	2356420	What's that. Nothing nothing hollowed out this mountain and he put all these RVs inside of it. So and you can basically you can lease a space in it drive your RV under the mountain and then when the apocalypse happens you've got to make it to the mountain.
2356660	2369820	But then you have a place to stay. And so we went on a tour of this place. It was massive. It was massive. Crazy. It's crazy under there. And the creepiest thing was there's all these RVs that he's lined up in this limestone cave.
2370020	2381260	And next to one of them I guess to indicate to prospective clients that it's a kid friendly place. He's put some astroturf and a little kid's bike and like like a like a ball.
2382940	2396740	The spookiest thing you've ever seen. And like you realize this guy who was giving me the tour. He's going to be God under this mountain when they seal the door. The overseer. Yeah. He was the overseer. It was really creepy.
2396740	2409500	The under seer. But also the place had a wine bar. It was like that was. Now I'm in. Now you got me. Wait. What are people buying spots. How much is the spot.
2409580	2422620	We'll see the. I don't remember how much how much the spot was. It was actually it was pretty reasonable. I remember it was like for like say for like the end of the world and having a place to go to or the fantasy that you have a place to go to.
2422940	2429140	Because he's taking care of all the prep shit. Right. So he's filling the jukebox with. I think we're alone now. Yeah.
2431700	2441340	Yeah. It's all theme songs. So you're like in the beginning it was cool. They were all apocalypse theme. But after a year it's the end of the world as we know it.
2441340	2464100	Yes. We did it years ago like like I think like 2002. I did some U.S.O. tours with Drew Carey. I did an improv for the troops around and we did one show up in Stavanger Norway for NATO troops like so a lot of doctors and like highfalutin fancy pantses that work for NATO.
2464420	2477180	And we went and visited Hitler's northern bunker which was a giant complex carved into a mountain like our actual superhero. He hit the super villa villain.
2481020	2492020	Get out. Wow. Oh my. Hey hey hey. Wow. Look he has to me. He had some ideas. He made the trains run on time.
2492940	2513620	It was it was straight up super villain Lex Luthor shit like. Yeah. And also a picture a giant mountain with giant tunnels built by Nazi engineers. It looked exactly like that. It looked like super villain lair. It wasn't fun. It was. It was really like like Dr. Evil shit. Were you shocked that Hitler's bunker wasn't fun.
2513620	2527060	I would have thought look that there would be like a bike and a kid's ball. There was no wine bar. No wine. Where was the fucking wine bar Hitler. That's the real crime.
2527060	2544980	I should think it's kind of funny that like I think we've talked about this before you know the old the meme of Hitler from that movie and you know it's been everything's been done with the subtitles like and then there was a guy who like we had to have talked about this.
2544980	2565620	I just thought was there was some guy who looks like a like that. I have no idea what corporation it was but it was like it's just like somebody some butter company or something like I don't know tried using that Hitler meme to like doing a little thing about their butter or something and everyone was like well then now we can't buy your butter and he's like but everybody else does it.
2565620	2586580	It's kind of funny how our our S and P is kind of projected inward or outward from some weird core of our body that's actually just we're just thinking like like no one no one was offended by that by that in relation to butter but everyone was like you can't sell butter and do that.
2586580	2616580	Because if you do that it's like it's more like we monitor each other for like a flickering LED you know we just like thump it when it's like flickering too much like it doesn't have anything to do with that actually being offended it's just like well if you don't if you haven't gotten the part if you can't figure out that what was Hitler's angle in that I need to know I have no idea speed with the name that the hit the meme I don't know you know like what's the movie called downfall you've seen it yeah people don't haven't seen it people put subtitles to Hitler losing a shit when he realized
2616580	2646580	is that the Russians are coming he's losing the war and so it'll be about the Dallas Cowboys are having another bad season and they just changed the subtitles right to why Hitler is all bummed out or like you know yeah Conan leaving whatever pop cultural usually like large events or the new iPhone is like what a warcraft update people don't like will often make it in there some some guy who was technically like accountable to some company like not Entenman's but something like you know was like
2646580	2676580	the end what Entenman's did a thing remember what was it I can't remember it was it was the it was the I love this and I'm sorry I was one of the coffee table book of this but what what book what did I just I could just go on the internet but girl I'm laughing cuz the not the the guilt the UK then the there was a I'm now I'm laughing because of what I have to now say after
2676580	2706580	laughing this much there was a lady who was famous for killing her baby you're right that is funny is it out Casey whatever yes the Casey Anthony verdict was what not guilty the hat so that the trending topic was not guilty and so some like kid that worked at Entenman's I think it was was like who's not guilty of eating delicious
2706580	2736580	brownie like he that person was just thinking like like oh shit I gotta get up on this trend like everyone's talking about not guilty for some reason because of a baby murder specifically an unpunished one and so it just kind of looked like they were like yeah yeah but they weren't even trying to do that obviously they weren't actually making it they didn't know they were probably like oh it's a trending topic yeah one more customer that's gonna be out that can buy Entenman's
2736580	2766580	anyways I like that stuff I love the triumvirate of Trump Casey Anthony and Hitler yeah this is going beautifully did you guys watch the OJ documentary by the way no not the documentary now oh you gotta see I just I was away I just heard about it oh it's um it's amazing cuz it's about I didn't know like the LAPD and so that the racial inequality 60 70s 80s and then with a
2766580	2796580	career and then 90s obviously you know he killed two people it's pretty I didn't know did he did he 100% okay wait don't you remember that bookkeeper you try to fight if I did it if I did it it would have gone a little something yeah now I didn't do it like do you guys see the cover of that book now everyone's like oh yeah if I did it I get a big joke but if you actually see the cover in big red letters that said I did it and then
2796580	2826580	inside if you know why cuz like it's it's very clear but Ron Goldman's parents got the rights to the book and they redesigned the cover so that it looks like I did it cuz he was the guy that he killed with Nicole Brown and so they published changed it so that's I did it and if it's really small whoa yeah is it he's in jail right now there yeah he's in jail cuz it's so crazy he like went to steal his Heisman Trophy and shit back but it was just
2826580	2856580	it's the craziest story cuz he got gets his friends together and he's gonna go get some of this stuff back but so you see the hotel footage of him and his friends but they get lost so you see the footage of them like going up and down elevators like going here and then coming back it's like Keystone Cops and then it's it's it's such a great documentary you would love it and that that stuff is in it at the end like him getting arrested yeah cuz nobody knows what he I didn't know what he
2856580	2886580	did after he got acquitted and before he got arrested for this he was making like he was releasing rap albums and shit while doing cocaine in Vegas like there's like rap videos of him like dancing with girls and it's amazing if you go to the if you ever do a gig in Vegas there's a restaurant called the Golden Steer it's like a famous old steak restaurant where like John Wayne's like Winchester Rifles are up there and there's the Sinatra booth and the Natalie Wood booth and the Joey Bishop booth it's great did you just yup Natalie what
2886580	2916580	there's a huge Natalie Wood fan in the crowd Dave Klein list two things freestyle rap and Natalie Wood but there is a table if you want to you it's called the Last Supper table as if you have a big group it's a table in the middle of the room and that's where OJ had his last dinner before he turned himself in for the to go to jail for the the kidnapping break-in thing that yeah you're still the juice juice listen to me
2916580	2946580	you're still the juice juice hey have you been to that steakhouse and if you've been to that steakhouse in Vegas that's got all the like sad cow paintings all over the wall looks kind of like John Wayne Gacy painted a it's the creepiest fucking place amazing steak but like it's like when you're they boast the saddest cows but no they have that that special like
2946580	2976580	wagyu beef where they like they rub soap into the cows for a year what I don't know it's good nice flavor they rub soap into the cows they do something I don't remember why they say they massage a cow they massage it and they feed it beer and stuff so it's like perfectly marbled but I swear to God I was sitting in there eating and all of a sudden underneath the music it was like they were playing the sound of cows being slaughtered
2976580	3006580	no yeah no yeah no real like I what does that sound like just like dying animal sounds like underneath it all like you get the feeling they actually hate cows they hate cows you get that feeling the guy who started the restaurant his mom was trampled by cows or something this is a cow
3006580	3036580	open a restaurant and I'm gonna first of all make sure it's the best steak you can get yeah otherwise nobody's gonna come in here also it's just like it's just an extra fuck you it's like plus you're delicious they show you the picture of the cow dying slowly of like yeah like I could just just like a being beaten with a with a shoe it's worse it's just no it's like it's the pictures are depressed looking cows they're like they just it's like they know something's not quite right in the paintings you know when the guy comes
3036580	3066580	to make a painting of you days are numbered like oh fuck you got the ease allowed the cows have to sit for a sad portrait when they're on death row yeah oh no drinking beer while someone's rubbing soap in them what why is this so I don't know about the soapy I don't know I don't know if the soap is real slaughterhouse oil painters it's the saddest job that's a bad gig but they make a lot of money ask you guys this Duncan and I were talking about this a
3066580	3096580	podcast I was just his 200th guest and we at one point we we briefly and we both agreed at the time but now I'd like to open it up to the panel if you were going to get eaten by cannibals like like let's say uh let's just let's just centralize it and say it's like traditional like like movie no not not no not man please Jesus no no I mean like actual just
3096580	3126580	like I'm trying to ground cannibals are technically a form of vampire I think and do like an 80s like thing where it's like you're you're you're in the jungle and you've been caught by an indigenous tribe of people that eat human flesh and so you are to them you're you're you're you're you're prey and you're you're you're getting like prepared to be cooked and you're gonna get eaten do you want them to enjoy you
3126580	3142640	don't eat comedians you know why oh god what is this because it because they taste funny you're allowed to buy guns now
3142640	3172640	by Obama's law all right you could be a shooter dance since you asked that was so not funny I might kill everybody you're back to the watch list since you asked that question well why don't you open the bed I I well cuz I you know I originally when we were sitting down we were in the middle of a larger screen about like yeah once you can't do anything about it but like yeah well let me I'm thinking about it like
3172640	3195840	cuz I'm trying to think like like like like so I'm picturing like okay so I'm long gone and then they're like they're talking about work and stuff and then like like they're eating me wait wait wait what are they how are they eating are you a hamburger I'm picturing like a like a like a just a glass like a dish like you would serve all gratin in or like a like just like a
3195840	3225760	sophisticated cannibals by the way it was just like I like I'm trying to just cuz I'm just trying to create like a glassware these cannibals have glass blowing like Logan's fucking run up it blowing glass and eating humans my two favorite because I'm trying to I'm trying to make it as much as possible like it's just people are eating just a palatable I'm just trying I'm trying to remove all any kind of extraneous like things so that's why I'm going with like a weird cartoonish like tribe of cannibals because they're
3225760	3255760	like oh there's like this mythical people that eat people and that's for them it's ever it's just it's just Wednesday and then and then because because and then I don't want to get into like trying to like write like all the like coconut Robinson Crusoe technology that they'd use to eat me so I'm just picturing like my my relatives like Easter or something and just like a banquet table and then it's like there's like so there's like chunks of me and like macaroni and like I was like my head with an apple in it and like I
3255760	3285760	just like like much shavings of my ass on like a arranged in a fan with like pimento and like and so and so I'm just picturing like two guys let's leave the ladies out of it tonight like good just to just commit to it what are their names Dan a dire dire dire dire straights and and
3285760	3315760	so they go like oh what did you do yesterday I ate some people and I had to go hunting for people and trying to grow people but that's you know that's not gonna work yeah me too and then and then like one of them you know they've been chewing on me for a little bit it's not like oh let's try this it's like it's like like they got there they were busy the guy that cooked me is like still cooking me oh it's not
3315760	3345760	right these guys by a different cannibal this is just like like like yeah I just what's the name of the guy that cooked you dave dave dave yeah and so like like like I mean it doesn't matter if you can't tell it doesn't matter so so like but then so then one of these guys is like yeah well you gotta you gotta you gotta worry about that because if you don't then that'll get you and then they and then they're like fuck this is so good you
3345760	3375760	want that I don't know I'm picturing that I'm like is that is that what I want is that what I want to think about as I'm dying is like that they're like have you tried the that that the what the pink stuff and I think I like mmm shit man that is fucking good is there any more of that like I don't know and they're like high five in each other I don't know but now I'm picked now is now a picture the other thing where they're like they're like yeah I don't like that I don't like that and which one do you like which one do you want I don't know I don't know it's I want them to like me you don't want
3375760	3405760	the last thing to be a rejection like he's fucking discussed you want it's nice you want to feel not that you're going to be aware of it but yeah you want to be like it becomes easy once you've accepted that you're going to get eaten but it's like right now sitting here I'm in a more resistant state so I'm like so I'm thinking about it more like no I hope they choke on it like like like because it's somehow maybe if they choke hard enough they won't be eating me God I don't want to get eaten like it's like forcing you into a realm where you have to already accept at the beginning of the scenario
3405760	3435760	that you're dead and you're being eaten well the you know that I think we started talking about that cuz uh we um I saw this uh naked and afraid episode where this guy this hippie guy like throws a rocket a jungle chicken any granny takes jungle chicken jungle chicken it was like a
3435760	3465760	it was a chicken in the Amazon any I think he means a velociraptor I'm pretty sure it was a chicken maybe the show is planting easy to hunt animals jungle chicken but he he picks up he picks up the jungle bird
3465760	3495760	and he he's like and it's not he's stunned it it's I think he may be trapped or he threw a rock at and stunned it he picks it up and he brings it up to his face and he's like I am so sorry I need your life energy right now I need you I need you and then he snaps its neck and I was thinking that's the most fucked up thing because the chicken doesn't speak English and right and then and just yeah this is
3495760	3525760	a good it's a lot like that guy on Schindler's list that's like shh shh shh shh shh the guy's like no no no what are you why are you being cute yeah you're you're if you're gonna eat it it's like this is an HP Lovecraft moment for the chicken it's surrounded by an alien camera crew and suddenly something is like that is satanic man so
3525760	3555760	there's another contrast that with another my favorite episode naked and afraid of this is like a Mormon dude who the Mormons like they refuse to like huddle for warmth like like wait that's part of their thing so if you're if they're do if but they have so many wives if they're about they have enough wives for the huddle I think if you're devout anything I don't know why you're on naked and afraid but but but but if you're devout anything but I think this but for my memory this was a
3555760	3585760	and I've seen it before as a Mormon person who blah blah blah the the the the he was he kind of lost his mind in the heat and he started trying to get this lizard and like the first day of hunting the lizard he grabbed the lizard by the tail the lizard kept the tiniest fucking lizard this lizard is the size of a goddamn like you're like not even your pinky that's like like the like the and so it's like come out it would be like on a branch and then
3585760	3615760	he'd like run at it and it would go in this little hole in the rock and then like what at one point he grabbed it by the tail and he had it and then the tail came off and he just had the tail oh yeah and then he was just so he just spent the whole episode going that lizard still in there every day it comes out and it mocks me and I thought he started losing his mind and the fucking like lizard came out and we're at a certain point I think he started like banging the rock like to drive the lizard out he wasn't even patient it was just like he just started banging the thing the lizard
3615760	3645760	came out he grabbed it in his hands and he and he just went yeah yeah and then he and then and then and then I'm pausing in the narrative but then he's just like to this victory victory cry and then lifted the fist to his face so that the lizard could make eye contact with him and and with no irony no no poetry no glibness out actual fucking Hemingway level like like just me and
3645760	3675760	the lizard like like like he just locked eyes with the lizard and and and said you like that you like that you ready for this here it comes and and bit the lizard to head off and and and man and shoot it like like it was a piece of hubba bubba was he just just as happy as the livelong day and like extra so there was contrast that was like oh man I get to eat I feel really bad
3675760	3705760	I'm so sorry this guy did you he wasn't even gonna live off of this thing he was more excited about how much suffering the thing had gone through is it naked during this whole interaction yes and yes that's the dark side of religion though that's what happens I feel repressed and you go out and you're biting heads off lizards they were they were definitely yeah they were they were there I that's a great show I think it's a it's a I think I mean
3705760	3735760	it's a great show and those guys who cuz I looked it up because the queue I was wondering how much they get paid to do it so they don't they they get nothing to go out there for 21 days it's like 4,000 bucks I can't remember you can look it up probably whatever the guild minimum is for a reality no it's true yeah well I know it's not even that because what they say is they say that you've won a contest so the way they did they're terrible prize that's what they know that that's what's funny is they have this great attorney who like figured out a way around I guess all the
3735760	3765760	laws about like what if they die on set and what is the culpability so the idea is you he goes strangers die all the time yeah what if they were strangers well it's a it's a contest you want a contest where the reward is you get to spend 21 days in an exotic location trying to survive while being filmed by a camera call the lizards you can eat yeah but that's a great shot I heard for I heard they that read their red tape did
3765760	3795760	work out for that anymore sir for the next season whatever country you go to they we just declare war on it and then you they send you over there and you're an enemy combatant oh wow so we can just it's 9-11 don't clap are you wearing a hat no currently yes oh good no but I
3795760	3825760	took up from a nap and I was in a rush and I okay you pull it off huh you pull it off I think it's tough for dudes to pull off non-baseball hats I think so but you not Jeff Jeff could definitely be like a spokes he could be the logo for like a spot spy spy garage door
3825760	3855760	Sam Simon I went to his house one time I hit a party and I walked in wearing a hat and I had like a it was raining so I like an overcoat on and I have a hat like this on and he goes what do you inspector gadget he kind of ruined my night I don't think it's I think it's more like a it's it's a William Burroughs like you seem like you would you would you might be you might shoot heroin and some
3855760	3885760	yeah some but not like the normal like like you know normal like white trash shooting heroin like heroin in a nice beautiful beautiful like opium den style is the reason why I fluent heroin the reason why I would never do heroin because I also the same reason why I'd never I've never smoked yeah why would you never do heroin because I would be I would really I think I'd really get into it yeah that's the thing of heroin people get into it but not I would get addicted to it
3885760	3915760	I've never smoked a cigarette because I think like I mean now I wouldn't do it because I'd like I'm mature like when when when you're a teenager and people start smoking I never did it because I just thought oh fuck I'm a smoker I would like to have the lighter and the tapping of the thing and I have reason to leave the room and go outside and have a cigarette but also if I were a smoker I would probably be fancy about it and I would like make my I would go to this I have a friend that goes to a tobacconist in Seattle it has his own like
3915760	3945760	numbered blend of tobacco and they make him his own cigarettes like I would be one of those oh yeah you'd have like a metal case and stuff yeah but if I were heroin I would have like an old vintage 1920s set that was used by you know like yeah Greta Garbo's uncle or whatever like that and I would have like fancy like a nice syringe so the reason you don't want to do heroin is you'd like spend too much money on the accoutrement no I wouldn't want to do it because I would die
3945760	3975760	doing heroin yeah the reason why I would get into it is because I would like the toys you'd like the toys yeah yeah you guys you guys you guys know my cat died oh my god just to just to pick things up a notch sorry yeah I heard you've done that that fib died while I was away in London I was very sad I sent you a message and gotten a reply oh I'm sorry sorry you're busy yeah his cat when did this when did this pass away I was I was
3975760	4005760	weeks ago yeah I was I was in I was in can I was in Canada I was going from the airport to the hotel and then Steve Levy called and he was in tears and was he sick I mean other than the I mean was he like did you think that he was fine no he was crying cuz my cat died are you a sociopath why is he crying did he look water is leaking from their eyes what is this
4005760	4035760	shit but did you know he was near the end well she she I beg your pardon I mean I had been prepared for it forever psychologically because I've had cats that have gone down before and then and fiv was like of indeterminate age but we knew at least 10 and she was fiv positive and she had a whole slew of lately last couple years she had like you know when they gave me the big bags of fluid with the big large
4035760	4065760	gauge needle I was like look I'm you know great I thought lately here we go like you know so I was ready and the but she was fine I mean I think that she might have had like kind of a kitty Alzheimer's kind of thing going on because towards the end she she she did she she really stopped caring about the dogs as much and I always felt really bad that the dogs are kind of terrorizing her and like
4065760	4095760	she was sort of like she didn't really care where she was and and but she had like a weird wiggle to her head that was happening and I kept wondering I was like she was on thyroid medication I was like I wonder if that's like the thyroid medication is like jacking her up a little too much would take her take her in routinely and just had a lot of shit going on and I and so after I left for Canada two weeks ago apparently the cat sitter came over and she was
4095760	4125760	like meowing in pain and was like walking funny so she took her to the vet and welcome to the best podcast ever you're never more than a Trump observation away from a dead cat story but but she took her to the vet and she had she had she had pancreatitis and it was in such bad shape that they started prepping her for an emergency like thing like they were going to like
4125760	4155760	send her to a facility or something like that while they were prepping her for surgery she had a stroke yeah Spencer was there Jesus well you were there I got there yeah she had a stroke and so she was essentially like I had to like authorize the first I had to verify that's all I could leave he was like describing to me the thing and I was like I was like so is the idea that I'm supposed to give permission like I couldn't I was like I didn't want to sound like a weird
4155760	4185760	monster that was my idea yeah you're like put it down no we're not there but I couldn't I couldn't and I had to keep verifying it uh but yeah it seemed like she was she had a like a she was like essentially they were keeping her alive and she was like at the at the door of eternity and I had to like give the okay I like to to to end it right yeah she probably would have made it anyway but yeah she probably wouldn't have been horrible I miss you
4185760	4215760	I was gonna make it but good call she probably would have made it but like you said seven hundred fifty dollar cap like you just like reveal some like policy I had about they said what they said with the with the insulin it would have been like seven fifty oh yeah also you're in Canada so with the exchange but I always I felt really guilty about it this is interesting to me I was
4215760	4245760	telling my therapist about it and I was expressing all this kind of self-loathing about it like which I would tonight except like I think she stepped in and because I was like oh man I just hit the deadbeat cat owners jackpot because I always felt really guilty about how this she was she and I were like buddies and partners and and I I just kind of like the dogs came into the picture and I got super busy and her last years were not the same as you know the Benjamin Button twenty
4245760	4275760	five-year-old years with the mattress on the floor and she and I just like fucking you know paint in the room and and and her coming up with ideas for my screenplays and me letting her hump my arm cuz she wasn't spayed yet you know we had we had peaks with that relationship and she traveled with me through several homes and intimate others all of whom adored her and everyone that met her loved her and and I I just felt agonizingly guilty in general because it was like oh she was neglecting
4275760	4305760	like in her life you know she just became like like she was a big house and she just kind of started hanging out she's like I don't like these dogs and it was like I'm busy and I was expressing all that to my therapist and she said yeah you know sounds like you have a lot of issues about neglect and like your cat you know has is gonna bring a lot of that stuff up but first and foremost while she's still your cat that just died why don't you make sure that you mourn her because what you're
4305760	4335760	doing right now is actually taking away from that process which it was kind of profound to me I was like oh I was like making her death about me and making it sad which is like the opposite of a cannibal going like this is delicious Dan Harmon like like you you I think that you didn't eat the cat now but Spencer did I do have a text from Spencer that says Spencer in the midst of all this stuff like like the like Spencer like she might die if she
4335760	4365640	does what do you want to do with the body should I put it in the freezer were you sad Spencer oh yeah yeah I was all busted up are you being sarcastic oh no no not at all hardest man to read no it was hard it was this is really tough I yeah no it was sucked if it was great Dan
4365640	4394960	your assistant Steve who's more than just let's not diminish him he's an awesome dude all the way around but he's such a good assistant he he let me know about that like he actually put out that that bat signal and I'd like let let your friends know about Fiv that's pretty amazing yeah the amount of shit that that guy does like that it's pretty crazy and he was he was so broken up about it and I was like how's Dan doing he's like well he's in Canada right now like he didn't like I don't know how much he knew about what you're great to Chris
4394960	4424080	cross so make it jump jump I was just like I don't know there's just some Canadian party is Chris cross Canadian I don't know just the first song in my head that seemed like the opposite of what you should be listening to after your cat dies that story was so sad it made that man throw up into a bag oh don't call him out he's fine yeah somebody's
4424080	4443680	birch in the room we'll be fine Wow it's been a real roller coaster are you all right sir props not he's unconscious do you we get call like do you want us to put you in the freezer
4443680	4473440	an ambulance how can we help yeah how can we help you someone should help her and help him get a call an ambulance yes the she what's happening no I guess while this is happening Daniel you want to do is do a couple scenes from from the
4473440	4499960	originals for us are over there helping Dan is over there helping see Daniel that's the real hero that's no vampire that's a hero over there he's like how can I actually help us sick we're all sitting here like oh Daniel actually is one of those people aside from being awesome hilarious a wonderful father and husband and everything he's just a great deal
4499960	4529920	around when the Katrina happened he he was like working like he was he had stuff going on he just he's from New Zealand but he was living here and he just picked up shit told us why I'm gonna fucking go and he went to he will not let me tell the story cuz I can tell it now cuz he's helping him humanity yeah he went there and just he's like I can't watch the news and watch what's
4529920	4558400	going on here without helping so he goes to New Orleans and he said hey I'm here I want to help people and like you can't help people unless you work for the Red Cross there's all this red tape and all this stuff so he commandeered a fucking bulldozer or some shit he stole he stole a Red Cross sticker if you hear he looked right into the construction workers eyes and cast a spell over this is all in the middle of the night
4560480	4589880	but he actually he had to kickbox very briefly a werewolf from Amnesty International he was going there cuz he knows there's blood banks there he wasn't going there to help blood people but this surrounded them with garlic so it was real tough he actually like he actually is a good person that like with that like sacrifice his own time livelihood and safety and just went out there and said like like if they're not gonna let me help I'm just gonna
4589880	4613880	pretend like I'm just gonna like go around like the red tape and just like get shit done and he fucking did it's like it's it's it's amazing why couldn't he save my cat where was he when my cat was dying that would be amazing if he came back on stage Daniel Gillies everybody Daniel Gillies with my cat yeah yeah
4619880	4648880	I was saying cunt on stage it in a lot of fosters Oh throwing a beer is not the best idea tap it it's gonna blow for those listening Dave Klein just tossed Daniel Gillies the largest can of beer he tossed him a keg of beer my tiny Trump hands couldn't catch it
4649880	4679800	Daniel how long were you in New Orleans for when you went out to help with the Katrina stuff only two weeks two weeks yeah you you you commandeer like you just you just said you faked credentials and got a bulldozer and started helping move move debris and shit that sounds so much more heroic than what I did and and I didn't rescue his cat so I'm a double fucker you heard that but but but no yeah he was right or true that you should have I don't trust me believe me the no what end up
4679800	4709780	happening was I went down there was no I couldn't rent anything in terms of a vehicle in Louisiana and I and I ended up looking around in Mississippi to try and find something like a truck I knew I'd need something some sort of vehicle if I was gonna be helping people and so I thank God this is so quiet and that sounds so namedropper II it's
4709780	4738560	okay to drop the name Katrina if you have sure it's not Beyonce and you hung out with her you met Katrina intimately so here it goes here it comes it's so it's it's weird he's my pal so Ryan Gosling and you dropped

4742960	4752160	wait dropping mics and names that's so cool wait no that's so cool no but seriously tell us tell us so cool
4754080	4758880	I forgot this part of the story Daniel go on that's so cool yeah we're just giving you shit go ahead sorry
4760160	4762160	so you called movie star Ryan Gosling
4762480	4774480	we're not behaving like people that want the rest of the story which I do I do I just a couple symmetricals hanging out go ahead symmetricals
4780880	4782880	I'm putting a pin in the word symmetricals
4782880	4799040	wait wait wait we're we're torturing the guy who if there's an earthquake and there will be soon it's 90% likely to be the one that saves your life
4801120	4808320	so I actually go ahead see oh sorry so look I was I was watching the stuff on tv and I was getting
4808320	4815280	more and more bummed out and I ended up uh I ended up making a call to Ryan and I said hey
4815280	4820640	should we go uh we should go and um do something about this I'm I'm going to the airport tonight
4820640	4826080	to try and get to uh to Mississippi because it's where I can rent the car because all the vehicles
4826080	4833040	are gone in Louisiana and uh he said because he's more heroic than I in the story he was already
4833040	4841360	on his way he's like I'm already he's like he's like I'm already running there no he's obviously
4841360	4848640	driving obviously yes all of his he'd already packed two tank tops he's running he's got two suitcases
4848640	4854320	he's holding him above his head and he's running faster than any man has ever run if you go down to
4854320	4859200	Katrina with Ryan Gosling and he's not driving you're just being an asshole he's just running
4859200	4867360	going Ryan Gosling you know I never I never dreamed that this story would sound as fabricated
4867360	4874720	as it does when I ended up telling it it sounds like total fucking shit but I think it sounds
4874720	4881280	amazing and like what every part of life should be like everyone should do this god spencer I want
4881280	4887360	to make love to you oh man I'm just so it's so cool no don't you're already there like this could
4887360	4894080	be a movie don't kiss you in front of all these people stop it oh my god we want to see it like
4894080	4899440	yeah so he's already on his way uh-huh and I said um so I said oh that's great because I'm on my
4899440	4905760	way to the airport I flew down to Mississippi I got I hired a bullshit moving truck and then I
4905760	4913200	drove to uh Louisiana and Ryan was already saying to meet him in Biloxi and so we went to um I went
4913280	4920080	to come meet him in Biloxi but we couldn't get past a certain um uh security area so um I said
4920080	4925360	that we should steal some uh some red cross stickers because the red cross actually had
4925360	4930560	super were super regulated and uh kind of militant about the way that they were approaching everything
4930560	4934640	like the the um the way in which they were distributing well you know in wartime they
4934640	4940000	were the red swastika I didn't actually they had to change that no I'm kidding I just
4940880	4946560	I said don't google that it just seems like the kind of thing that you'd okay too soon
4948400	4952320	right so we stole but what if they thought they could you know what if they thought that was
4952320	4957360	enough they're like oh boy I better make that across yeah let's take some of these lines off
4958800	4962480	okay so you guys uh we worked with the red cross for a couple of days and before we
4962480	4967280	became you stole stickers before I stole the stickers I was getting bummed out working with
4967280	4971200	the red cross I don't want to sound disparaging it was the red cross on this thing that's being
4971200	4976000	filmed and recorded but but but they were being super regulated about it there were certain hours
4976000	4980240	in the day that you could work and it could help and it was like sort of 10 to four and we were
4980240	4984960	like well we wanted to sort of go into the heart of things and Biloxi was uh the most fucked up so
4984960	4988960	we ended up um stealing some stickers from the red cross that we could get through the um security
4988960	4997760	and and um we ended up sort of uh setting up like a temple there um like a a Hindu sort of
4997760	5002880	temple thing there there's a there's a huge sort of Thai population there actually and then we ended
5002880	5009200	up uh we met up with some guys who had bulldozers yes the bulldozers did exist and uh and and we
5009200	5015920	we were sort of clearing debris from the streets and are you Hindu barely but you are no I'm not
5016720	5022160	not not at all so why did you why what do you mean you set up a it was a nice refuge uh he
5022160	5026880	went and he didn't make one I thought he said that too like holy fuck you and Ryan Gosling
5026880	5036960	built a Hindu temple in Katrina wow yeah that's what I thought I was it's still there today yeah
5036960	5042800	and it's one and it's and it's and it's and it's it's it's it's raised their um their city's revenue
5042800	5049840	by 10 percent it's like a profitable temple it's like a game of civilization right it's like Daniel
5049840	5054240	what was the party was it your birthday that you had at the uh at the Chateau Marmont when uh
5054240	5058640	Ryan Gosling did the coolest thing I've ever seen as a gift was it was it your birthday it was my
5058640	5067280	birthday and so uh he cured AIDS simply with his biceps with mariachis uh that's why there's a
5067600	5072880	temple in the middle so Daniel got one of those cool like uh like the Chateau Marmont hotel
5072880	5076320	there's a few rooms that have awesome balconies are big you like like and they'll have like
5077360	5080800	like there's like dining room in it like like so they they brought up a full-on
5080800	5084320	all right okay that was that yup was for dining rooms
5086640	5090640	Natalie wanted dining rooms for those of you playing they're playing bingo tonight
5090640	5097680	he's so easily impressed a whole room where you just so specifically impressed easily
5098800	5102880	I mean he didn't he didn't care nothing for the red swells care about the Hindu temple
5102880	5109600	they erected overnight but dining rooms mind blown so yeah so there's a knock at the door
5109600	5115280	the party is already in progress and in walks what would you call Daniel a seven piece band
5115280	5122880	ten seven a full-on east la mariachi band and the full the full thick like the big hats with
5122880	5128080	the tassels and the big like the silver embroidery and they came in and they're singing ceely to
5128080	5134720	lindo they come in Ryan uh Ryan Gosling just fucking brought a mariachi band that was his
5134720	5140240	gift to the party he went to that's a terrible gift to a party no it's the best they came out
5140240	5143440	and they stood in the balcony and they fucking serenaded us and then they played like four or
5143520	5147760	five songs and boned out and it was like and I asked him like that's the greatest thing I've
5147760	5155520	ever seen in my life he's like 300 dollars it's like that's all it costs like they'll come play
5155520	5161920	your party I'm like I think he gave them all signed head shots that's a great gift that's
5161920	5166080	really good well how do we get to be friends with this guy I am friends with him can I tell you my
5166080	5177600	story you've been waiting so I was uh you guys you guys were fresh responders at 9-11
5181600	5186720	this episode's title is the Ryan Gosling diaries he called him on 9-11 and then Ryan was like I've
5186720	5197760	been running since 9-10 no uh when I was uh when I was in when I was in college uh I went we went to
5197760	5203200	India and uh we were taking a boat down the Ganges River you and Ryan Gosling no this is
5203200	5207840	no just me and a friend but Ryan Gosling comes into the story so we're on the Ganges River
5207840	5212000	taking we're on a boat on the Ganges River and this like you know the Ganges River there's a
5212000	5219200	lot of death floating down so there's like a a cow floating down the river bloated and and birds
5219200	5223600	are riding on its back and and I look at my friend I'm like I just don't think I can handle
5223600	5231600	all this death Ryan Gosling explodes out of the cow any no joke and he looks at he looks at me
5231600	5241760	and he says death is just a part of the cycle of life that's amazing that he's so cool
5241760	5248880	I how could he hear you how could he hear you from inside a cow he's Ryan Gosling man
5254160	5257360	I can't get a read on Daniel I don't know if he's gonna beat us up or
5263200	5267440	after I made that horrible joke to Obama Ryan Gosling dropped from the sitting I was like that
5267440	5277840	wasn't that bad he he he dropped down like in front of Obama as Obama walked away and whispered
5277840	5284400	to Obama and Obama came back to you and said like on second thought given my joke yours wasn't that
5284400	5293120	bad yeah I just think that's the coolest thing ever though to imagine that when disasters are
5293120	5303680	happening there are beautiful famous symmetrical men on the way to help that's a really cool
5303680	5312560	fucking thing I think it's an amazing thing this is Daniel this is your worst nightmare isn't it
5312560	5320080	I hate this but my beard smells beautiful so fuck all of you but what do you I mean what is that
5320080	5328560	instinct because okay so micro heroism obviously uh well yeah the uh so the guy who was in the
5328560	5334160	audience and then he he he needed help uh so you escorted him none of us made a move
5335040	5341360	Daniel I was still talking to Daniel like he was on stage Daniel was already in action like yeah
5341360	5346480	Duncan and I were like making fun of the least funny person on the male was like whispering to
5346480	5357680	me don't point him out and you what did you do I said I'm sorry and then Daniel's there helping
5357680	5366960	we saved his life do we have an update on our on our yeah Ryan Gosselm to the hospital came down
5367920	5373600	yeah on one of those rope ladders yeah just scooped him up yeah that's gorgeous
5373600	5383200	lad yeah the guy just called an uber and it was like Ryan Gosling is coming
5383760	5389040	and then a helicopter shows up he's somehow piloting and hanging off the ladder
5389040	5397280	but then there's the dark montage of stories that are like uh Ryan Gosling lawsuit continues
5397280	5402400	as the woman he pulled from the burning car asserts he threw out her shoulder in the news
5402400	5408320	Ryan Gosling's a brush with the Interpol agency and it's like it's like this montage and it's
5408320	5412960	like a fall from grace like there's no more you know we started to take Ryan Gosling for granted
5413680	5418960	yeah and then we started fucking shitting on him and and then it's like and then it's like
5418960	5423600	and then the end of that credit sequence is like like like still no word from Ryan Gosling after
5423600	5430880	two years years years years and then you go to this the Gosling cave or what I mean I don't want
5430880	5436960	to yeah I don't want to over develop he's doing he's yeah he's doing push-ups and he's like 3000
5436960	5443920	okay no I think he would just be sitting in there like like like no he wouldn't be I mean
5445040	5446800	I mean that would be a sad moment
5449680	5456320	why would he be doing a 3000th push-up because I think now he's ready to go out again oh okay in
5456320	5462320	my version we're already at like he's now gonna go but and you did you put that right after the
5462320	5467520	I mean but it's spend any time yeah over two years you're the writer well I mean
5468320	5474160	my guess is he's carving Hindu deities in this cave and sitting in front of them that's a good
5474160	5483040	yeah it's like he's in a jakarta it's like like sundown and there's like and then he's like he's
5483040	5489280	like he's in a bazaar and he's the finishing he's going no to shop at that shop at that
5489280	5496880	to to hop hop and there's like like all these people are climbing him and kissing him and he's
5496880	5506000	like ah masha tay masha tay ah and then he goes back to like this like 1800s like kind of like
5506000	5513280	british colonial office building where he's a detective but he plays soccer with some kids on
5513280	5521680	the way back oh yeah no yeah he's like he's like that kid the kid with the like uh greasy polo
5521680	5530800	shirt that like he goes like gosling gosling sir mr gosling uh and he goes like oh no let me show
5530800	5539680	you kick kick jump kick kick and then hop hop and then but that kid on page 70 blows up that's
5540400	5545200	right he notices he's cradling that kid's fucking body going when the kid kicks the ball he notices
5545200	5549440	that the kid like he turns and there's like a weird like scar on the back like a cigar burn on it and
5549440	5553600	he stores that information later on he like he finds out there's a guy that loves to burn kids
5553600	5563520	with cigars and shit like that we were making a fun detective slash superman kind of thing he
5563520	5567840	goes home to his he goes home to his uh you know his or his office like i said it was like his
5567920	5572800	receptionist is like a money penny there's kind of a sexual like like um like pepper pots kind of
5572800	5577360	like it's too it's too hot to be sexualized until the end of the movie kind of relationship
5577360	5582160	and uh and she's like uh what's going on out there he's like i gotta come all the way to jakarta
5583040	5586160	and there's a kid out there he's got a fucking cigar burn on the back of his head
5587040	5593600	ryan he can't save everybody wherever you go he's like yeah what are the cases uh walrus
5593600	5601360	poaching uh happened on the orient walrus poachers fucking the jakarta walrus poaching trade
5602720	5607840	what's going on for too long but it's great if the guy poaching the walrus is the cigar burning man
5607840	5615120	that's easy he doesn't just poach he he burns kids sometimes yeah it's pretty it's the lame
5615120	5623200	it's a lame villain man how fun would it be to really be part of a murder mystery on a real
5623200	5631040	train well it depends on what what end of the murder you're on not being the victim or even the
5631040	5637120	person who's responsible for figuring it out but just to be i feel like if there's a murder on a
5637120	5643280	train let's stop that train let's all get off right stop the fucking train let's go first
5643280	5646480	off you stop the train i think there's i think that the there's trains that need they're using
5646480	5651040	that track i don't think you can just stop a train i think well i'd prefer to have it stopped in
5651040	5656160	that instance agree not if you're an oncoming train but the closest way the the quickest way
5656160	5661120	to get to a place where there's cops and stuff is to keep the train moving if you stop the train
5661120	5666720	who can get there because the track is already occupied yeah i i get out of there there's there's
5666720	5672800	been a murder on a closed but you're in siberia the train's going through siberia it's like a
5672800	5677920	in the middle of nowhere oh it's snow piercer yeah oh man it's just or it's just a train i
5678640	5682640	i feel like when when there's a murder mystery on the train and you come into a station because
5682640	5688160	you have to stop every so often on a train the cops are too they're too visible on the platform
5688160	5692800	they they come looking around they give the murderer too much time to fucking you know
5692800	5697280	he's hiding in the bathroom he's climbing on the roof yeah who knows what's happening they
5697280	5703440	should make train roofs a little less easy to walk i was just gonna say that and train doors and
5703440	5708640	they should yeah you should not be able to walk out of a train door climb up on the roof as an
5708640	5713120	option right there's a ladder reading leading to the roof and if all that's going to be going on
5713120	5716000	all the time and there's going to be that many murders on trains then you got to make those
5716000	5723040	tunnels higher oh yeah so the good guy yeah no but the good guy knows the duck right yeah but
5723040	5730080	you know there's that old saying uh uh uh murder is on top of trains aren't the aren't the are
5730160	5736240	people that kill people the tunnels tunnels kill kill people tunnels don't kill people
5736240	5742080	murder is on top of trains kill people and i'll say with tunnels kill people yeah but if you look
5742080	5747440	into those stats a lot of times what you'll find is that this the statistical likelihood
5747440	5754160	that the person that gets killed on top of a during a train fight um they've they've studied this
5755040	5761040	it's as you'd expect contrary to what movies would have you believe half of the time the guy
5761040	5767040	who gets uh uh taken out by the tunnel is the good guy half of the time if you might as well
5767040	5772880	flip a coin assuming a two-man fight on top of a train you know really that's correct sir good
5772880	5781600	good job 50 50 you've got a math genius the statistic is it's actually very similar to if
5781680	5786160	you have a weapon it's more likely that you're going to kill yourself with a weapon that you're
5786160	5791280	going to defend yourself with a weapon in the same way if you're on a train it's more likely
5791280	5796400	that you're going to kill yourself on the train for sure based on these the reddit videos have
5796400	5802080	you seen those where there's a whole there's a whole thing happening and i think it's in india
5802080	5809280	where these kids hang out the side of the train for for thrills so they will like hang themselves
5809280	5814960	outside the train and then there's a whole genre now a video so the kids just getting smashed in
5814960	5823200	the holes and you're watching these all the all night i can't get to sleep it's i can't get to
5823200	5829680	sleep i wonder i wonder why yes why can't i sleep i've seen 30 kids being murdered no i i i mean i
5829680	5836000	can't get to sleep unless i see the kid getting murdered and then i go right out oh man you gotta
5836000	5843040	go to man 4chan plus china equals fucking crazy fucking well you know like the guy that invented
5843040	5847040	a microwave he he never wanted one in the house because he realized how he knew how strong the
5847040	5854400	magnatrons are and how like how bad they are for our bodies um ramen tunnels is that a word you made
5854400	5859840	up what a magnatron so magnatron it sounds like something out of the transformer yeah he fights
5859840	5866240	optimus prime is it's not gonna show the nemesis to optimus prime magnet magnatrons are the business
5866240	5871280	end of a microwave they're the things that cook your food i think i should be the business end of
5871280	5881120	the mic oh shit magnetron no i'm star screen oh i'm always trying to accept magnetron yes
5881120	5892560	yes you can't be the business end of a microwave i would do a better job making ramen star scream
5892560	5900560	i tire of your incompetence wait who's that character magnetron magnetron which is why he
5900560	5906480	doesn't have to sound like megatron it's called am i wrong about magnetron yeah it's microwaves
5906880	5913520	one guy yes one 50 50 i bet he's right
5916560	5922080	magnetron that was the most outraged response to someone being a he said that's how he's read
5922080	5928640	that he's microwaved is that the inventor of microwaves back there he sounded like like like
5929600	5935680	we could make that the guy was virtually dead two seats in front of you virtually dead but
5935680	5942640	that's what outrages you beautiful it was also like the 15th time today that someone
5942640	5948000	has gotten that wrong that was the vibe of him correcting that it's like 15 times someone said
5948000	5955600	magnetron it's not fucking magnetrons microwaves the cavity magnetron is a high-powered vacuum
5955600	5959920	tube that generates microwaves using the interaction of a stream of electrons in the magnetic field
5960720	5966240	while moving past a series of open metal cavities hashtag go fuck yourselves
5972800	5979040	nobody was on the other side of this issue we just wanted clarity we just wanted clarity you
5979040	5984560	guys made a fool of me no but it's different what if i fucking like i something fell on me right now
5984560	5991280	and i become the phantom of the opera like i just i i haunt this podcast forever while heating up
5991280	5997680	your food you're both right because a magnetron is the tube that makes the microwave so he was
5997680	6002400	more right because the thing that's going around doing the things is the microwave yeah created by
6003120	6008960	well a magnet no this is which came first the magnetron of the microwave
6009680	6016240	okay who knows well i'm more impressed by den star scream impression that's pretty
6016240	6019680	good dude that was beautiful yeah he was a great in the back counter commander
6022080	6029280	yeah exactly i'm star scream can you do star scream rap yes
6032080	6033360	zac you got a beat for the troubles
6038960	6049280	no no no i i i should be the leader of the decepticons

6266800	6280800	katrina
6285680	6296880	yo yeah balloons how do you inflate them with your breath don't hate them you're gonna need
6296880	6301360	them for parties celebrate them put them on a string and let them fly and how you debate them
6302080	6307200	whether they're good or bad is it a balloon that you possess or did you ever had the balloon or
6307200	6313680	was it a dream is it all filled with air or would you use steam if you do it might expand and take
6313680	6319760	you all across this glorious land you might land down in the field of corn you might get outside
6319760	6325600	and find a prehistoric horn you can blow a tutu and summon cavemen and then you go all around
6325600	6331920	history again you got stonehenge you got columbus you got glimmid rocket i'm gonna fuck this
6332880	6338160	pussy okay all right all right wait it's been a good show
6348640	6350160	what have we learned
6361920	6370800	okay all right so
6374160	6380720	you came down pretty hard on balloons you know there's a helium shortage have you heard about
6380720	6385200	that is that true we should probably close out with that topic yeah you guys heard about the
6385200	6390800	helium shortage it's gonna be bad it's terrible all computers basically are made with helium
6391520	6397040	and we're just putting them in balloons there will be a point when balloons are like i mean
6397040	6401440	we'll probably be pretty old but wouldn't all the helium just be up higher yeah that's the problem
6401440	6404880	so you get why don't we just go go up well then there's going to be a ladder shortage don't just
6404880	6415920	get a net you can't just pull it out of the sky you can't is all the helium living up on the edge
6416000	6421200	of our atmosphere right a lot of it helium is triple bonded hydrogen or is it sure is dan
6423440	6429040	no i don't know it's its own its its own element it's just it's it's uh well what is it it's twice
6429040	6434320	as much what am i fucking idiot it's a rare of course it's an element right i'm so sorry i'm
6434320	6442640	so sorry it's the second element helium gas hydrogen it becomes helium right no helium is its
6442640	6450720	own element yeah but but you have to have yeah we all know so little don't love me in with that
6450720	6455360	that's i i i didn't know that was a thing when i was doing the improv shows in london that one of
6455360	6460080	the suggestions or like the gets for the scene was the world is running out of something what
6460080	6463920	is it and someone yelled a bunch of people yelled helium i thought that was just a weird thing
6463920	6469280	nah it's true man it's not funny so what happens when we when we run out of our helium the unicorns
6469280	6473040	all that we're not going to be able to make computers but didn't the uh doesn't the law of
6473040	6476880	conservation of helium say that we're gonna we're not gonna run out of helium is it's gonna all just
6476880	6490000	be floating up at the edge of the thing they're gonna repeal that law are we really running out
6490000	6494640	of helium yeah yeah because it's priced not what it's worth because you can't just buy a fucking
6494720	6502080	balloon like if the world was just it would cost a lot more to buy a balloon because of how much
6502080	6506960	we could how much value there is in the amount of computers you can make with that helium balloon
6506960	6511760	what does helium do for computers i think it's just very cold it has something to do with like
6511760	6516480	i don't know it has something to do with what liquid helium this guy says that's probably true
6516480	6520880	i mean probably just something with electronic stuff it's great you think it's used in coolant
6520880	6525360	systems i think it's just used to make the superconducting chips or something like that
6527120	6529200	thank you that sounds like bullshit sir
6531760	6538080	i don't trust get out of here with your other vomiting friend tonight let's let's all compress
6538080	6543680	it and circulate it i don't i don't know what you mean talking about fucking come out
6544640	6547920	compress it and circulate it that's what got it
6550560	6555120	where did they get helium where do we get helium when we mine it from the clouds
6556480	6561200	what about helium what's the other control gas wells or clouds okay
6562960	6568320	is that right is this what about helium three what's what's what's up with helium three
6568480	6569440	oh it's the worst
6577120	6586240	wow it's a it's a it's a it's a contentious but lethargic crowd tonight we're we're all so
6586240	6590880	fatigued by by global events like everyone in LA is just like kind of going through the motions
6591520	6599120	someone like fuck fracking bro hey spencer's kind of tired spencer can we do a show maybe next
