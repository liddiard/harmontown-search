0	27700	Hello everybody, welcome to Harman Town.
27700	31940	As always, every Monday night here at Meltdown in the Nerd Melt Theater in Hollywood, California,
31940	35740	Harman Town is once again in session to solve all the world's crises.
35740	42540	Won't you welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harmon.
42540	54300	Yeah, boy, we got lots to talk about.
54300	55660	Let's get right to it then.
55660	61540	Yeah, we'll talk about the obvious thing later, because it's a weird area.
61540	65700	I want to talk about it with friends, because I was sealed off today, completely sealed
65700	66700	off.
66700	71060	I was writing for Rick and Morty from bed, I had a deadline, and I'm doing my pass on
71060	76980	a script, so I was completely turned my phone off, didn't have the internet, and then Aaron
76980	81620	called me from out in the world and told me about what happened in Boston today, which
81620	86220	by the time you're hearing this as a recording, we'll have all these facts, but it just happened
86220	88980	today.
88980	92980	What I want to talk about is actually just the craziness about it.
92980	98460	It's not like we're going to score noble points by not talking about it, nor are we going
98460	102220	to score any other kind of point by talking about it.
102220	106620	It's endlessly fascinating, of course, and we should capitalize on it.
106620	113500	Because it would be weird to talk about that first and then talk about Aaron's leg.
113500	117100	I just like the Brave New World we live in, where you can come out and the audience shows
117100	122260	up in Hollywood, California, and a guy comes out with a red solo cup in his hand and just
122260	124660	reading off his phone for the first two minutes of the show.
124660	125660	I love it.
125660	126660	Well, I was just holding it up.
126660	128940	I'm not reading anything off of it.
128940	131500	This is what my phone says.
131500	132620	This is my Evernote app.
132620	138500	It says, Aaron's leg, wedding cake, Minecraft, Alex's space jam, and Zardoz.
138500	139660	That's what it says.
139660	140820	That sounds like a full lineup.
140820	141820	So I don't know.
141820	144380	I get nervous, so I stare at things if I'm holding it.
144380	145740	I'll put this away.
145740	148260	Aaron's not here tonight because she cut her leg.
148260	153340	Is she a cutter?
153340	162580	She ... I have these very low, low, thigh-high, tetanus-riddled, sharp, rustic.
162580	174860	Dusty pirate yard lamps, as you walk up the stairs to Dannadu, and she ... It was a long
174860	175860	time coming.
175860	180740	Someone finally, while walking down them, I believe she was cutting a wide berth for
180740	187860	her ... She was disembarking for one of Dustin's dates.
187860	190780	For those of you who listen to this, it feels terrible, her podcast.
190780	193100	She had just finished recording a date preamble.
193100	197700	They're doing this bachelor thing, where Dustin's going on dates with women that are throwing
197700	201820	themselves at Dustin, and it's a horrible affair.
201820	205220	These lovely young ladies are coming over to my house, where Veral Audio is recording
205220	207500	its podcast, and ... Sounds horrible.
207500	209860	Getting interviewed with Dustin and whatnot, and then they leave for these dates.
209860	216980	So leaving this date for this date, Aaron escorting them out, I think to be polite, finally
216980	223060	walked close enough to one of these horrible, jagged, toothy, cartilage ... I think they're
223060	227100	made out of shark cartilage, these yardlights that I have.
227100	232660	They're green and yellow, and they're supposed to be just black, probably, but I think they
232660	237380	were made in the 1900s, and just covered in tetanus.
237380	241420	Honed to a razor's edge.
241420	242500	Right along the path.
242500	243580	Just coated.
243580	250460	This titanium laminated in tetanus, and so she scraped her thigh on it.
250460	254780	She's got this cut on her leg about the length of, let's say ... I don't know what I'm holding
254780	255780	up here.
255780	256780	My penis.
256780	257780	A cigarette.
257780	258780	But the length of my penis.
258780	259780	Looks like three inches.
259780	263420	Your penis is shaped and colored exactly like a cigarette, if I'm not mistaken.
263420	264420	Yes.
264420	265420	An e-cigarette.
265420	271900	It has harmless water vapor in it, but you can get it in any flavor.
271900	274180	Yellow pebbles.
274180	277020	Why is this guy raising his ... Oh, you're holding up your e-cigarette.
277020	278020	Are you a vapor?
278020	279020	Are you vaping?
279020	280020	Yeah.
280020	281020	Do you vape indoors?
281020	282020	Yeah.
282020	283020	At work.
283020	284020	I don't give a shit.
284020	285020	Are you a former smoker?
285020	286020	Yes.
286020	287020	Okay.
287020	288020	Hey, come up here.
288020	289020	What's your name?
289020	290020	I'm sorry.
290020	291020	If you want to come up here.
291020	292020	I learned my ... Okay.
292020	293020	Yeah.
293020	295580	If you start crying or freaking out, I don't want to ... Hey, why'd you come up here?
295580	296580	You told me to.
296580	297580	What's your name, sir?
297580	298580	You told me to come up here, dude.
298580	299580	I was drinking.
299580	300580	What's your name?
300580	301580	What's your name?
301580	302580	I'm Tom Tyler.
302580	303580	Anyway, I'm putting.
303580	304580	Okay.
304580	305580	All right.
305580	307580	Unexpected segment about e-cigarettes.
307580	308580	It's fun.
308580	313580	Then we'll talk about the worst terrorist attack down our country since 9-11.
313580	314580	Yeah.
314580	315580	It's awful.
315580	316580	But first, e-cigarettes.
316580	317580	Fat or fashion?
317580	318580	I don't know.
318580	319580	Okay.
319580	320580	So there's water vapor.
320580	321580	Yeah.
321580	322580	It's water vapor.
322580	326420	Well, water vapor is the only emission.
326420	330580	It starts off with the chemical that is food coloring, which is ... I'm not going to get
330580	331580	into it.
331580	332580	Purple or glycerin.
332580	333580	Okay.
333580	334580	Flavor.
334580	335580	And then however much nicotine you want.
335580	336580	Right.
336580	338780	So I know people who smokes e-cigarettes at work.
338780	339780	They're into it.
339780	340780	They're not into it.
340780	344420	I know someone who doesn't smoke at all and kind of got into it just because everyone
344420	345420	else at work was doing it.
345420	346420	Well, this is a new thing.
346420	347420	It's a new thing.
347420	349260	I'm sitting in bed next to my girlfriend today.
349260	351300	She comes back from getting her antibiotics.
351300	352300	She's holding a bag.
352300	353300	She goes, I got it.
353300	356260	I know I keep going off on our diet.
356260	358180	It's because of comfort and all this stuff.
358180	359180	She does this big monologue.
359180	360940	I'm like, what is it going to happen?
360940	364500	Is this a thing that ends with couples therapy?
364500	367700	It's my fault that we always eat mac and cheese.
367700	369940	She pulls out e-cigarettes just today.
369940	370940	This is why I brought you up here.
370940	371940	I want to talk about it.
371940	373340	For both of you, like his and hers e-cigarettes?
373340	374340	No, no.
374340	376780	I can't touch them for religious reasons.
376780	377780	I'll explain later.
377780	380260	I believe it.
380260	385620	But I want to know about this because she got zero nicotine e-cigarettes.
385620	386620	Yeah.
386620	389380	I mean, I guess you get kind of the experience from it.
389380	390380	You breathe in.
390380	391580	You're like, oh, something's going in.
391580	392580	You breathe out.
392580	393900	It has what they call a throat hit.
393900	395300	It has a throat hit.
395300	397340	That's the worst name though.
397340	398340	Throat hit.
398340	400860	Like, oh man, I got this 36 milligram.
400860	402580	It's got the best throat hit.
402580	407180	Fucking guys in their basements modding like power drill batteries into e-cig things.
407180	408180	It's...
408180	409180	Yeah, no.
409180	410180	What they're modding?
410180	411180	There's something.
411180	415500	It looks like they're holding like an electric screwdriver in their hands.
416500	417500	To get more nicotine?
417500	418500	Yeah.
418500	420500	So it's like the battery causes the coil to heat faster.
420500	421500	So they get this...
421500	422500	Yeah, no.
422500	424500	I totally hacked my e-cigarette.
424500	425500	Exactly.
425500	426500	No, it's exactly that.
426500	427500	I put tobacco in.
427500	428500	It's exactly that.
428500	430500	I jail broke that motherfucker.
430500	431500	Basically.
431500	432500	Basically.
432500	433500	No, no.
433500	438500	I drove by a gas station and it said electronic cigarettes.
438500	443780	That sounds like a joke from a sketch group that was shitty 20 years ago.
443780	449460	Or a horrible 1994 direct-to-video movie set in the future with a lot of kickboxing
449460	450460	in it.
450460	451460	Yeah.
451460	452460	Well, a throat hit is a critical punch.
452460	453460	Sure.
453460	454460	No, that's not what I mean.
454460	457820	I just mean like, you know, like in Aliens, you know, you see Sigourney Weaver lights up
457820	461580	on cigarette and of course like the prop master's like, hey, look, what is it?
461580	463300	Could it be just like a Marlboro Red?
463300	464300	No, make it yellow.
464300	465300	Make it yellow.
465300	466300	Make it glow.
466300	469980	Throughout history we've been trying to figure out how to make something that Bogart would
469980	470980	do.
470980	473940	It's like, we've experimented with varieties.
473940	474940	Now we're living in a world.
474940	475940	It's got a, it lights up.
475940	477500	Stephen Dorf is on a beach in a black wing.
477500	480740	It lights up with LEDs and smoke is out.
480740	481740	It's interesting.
481740	486140	And also, of course, when you introduce technology into people's mania and addictions, you're
486140	488300	going to have people in their basement souping them up.
488300	489940	That's exactly what it is.
489940	490940	You got it.
490940	494540	But it's as opposed to, I mean, I suppose there's an element of it that's the techies
494540	496980	kind of up in the, up in the hills kind of.
496980	497980	All right.
497980	498980	What's your name?
498980	499980	Tyler.
499980	504340	So the big question for me is, because my girlfriend came home today with e-cigarettes
504340	510740	that she, as a non-smoker, I quit when I was 32 and I cannot, I quit, I made a deal with
510740	512900	God that I cannot go back on.
512900	514300	It's probably a good idea.
514300	518500	As much as I'm tempted to, because these things will look interesting to me, I won't, I can't
518500	521420	put one in my mouth because I don't know if God knows the difference.
521420	522420	Yeah.
522420	523420	All right.
523420	527500	And what I want to know is, what is she inhaling?
527500	529340	She's like, oh, she's like, well, it's zero nicotine.
529580	531100	I'm like, yeah, but you're inhaling something.
531100	532100	I looked online.
532100	534500	It's like, basically it's like, so there's nothing burning.
534500	537580	I mean, there's nothing that is turning into a carcinogen.
537580	540220	You're not setting something on fire and inhaling it.
540220	544140	It's turning a chemical into vapor.
544140	546180	It's basically like you said, like food coloring in there.
546180	550140	I mean, you're just, you're smoking food coloring with nicotine in flavor in it, but it's not,
550140	551140	you're not burning it.
551140	552680	It's just turning into a vapor.
552680	553940	You hold down a button.
553940	555380	It super heats a coil.
555380	556380	You inhale it.
556380	557380	Right.
557380	558380	You're like, this is kind of a cigarette.
558740	562580	The FDA says that there's no significant health risks.
562580	563580	Yeah.
563580	568260	I mean, it's, it's, we're talking about the zero, so Walter Raleigh said the same thing
568260	569260	about tobacco.
569260	573700	I mean the, and, and the FDA says the same thing, but that's pertain.
573700	576940	It's somewhere in the thousands of magnitude as bad for you as a normal cigarette.
576940	577940	Yeah.
577940	578940	A millionth.
578940	579940	It's a million.
579940	580940	Or more.
580940	581940	Some of them have a one millionth or whatever.
581940	586060	So while we're on the topic and I have you up here, so you're a former smoker.
586060	587060	Yes.
587060	589580	Are there any cigarettes to quit or how long?
589580	590820	It's cheaper.
590820	592660	I can do it at my desk at work.
592660	594260	It doesn't, it doesn't matter.
594260	595420	It's kind of, it's a thing.
595420	597620	So I mean, I work at a video game company.
597620	598620	We're kind of cool.
598620	599940	Does it really fulfill the craving?
599940	600940	It does though.
600940	601940	Look at him.
601940	602940	He's ripped right now.
602940	603940	He's, he's just jamming on nicotine.
603940	604940	How do you know?
604940	608340	Cause when I smoked, I quit at 32.
608340	610620	You smoke down to the filter and then you put it out.
610620	613020	So you have that satisfaction of the, of the progress indicator.
613020	616580	So, you know, I have friends of mine who are packet day smokers.
616660	618140	I was never a packet day smoker.
618140	621860	I was like a pack every couple of days or maybe if I was out drinking a pack a day,
621860	624300	but mostly like I was a pack every few days.
624300	629100	Like I, I smoke just when I feel like it, I get a couple puffs of it and then that's
629100	630100	it.
630100	631100	Oh, okay.
631100	632100	It's like, I feel like I'm good.
632100	633100	We're good.
633100	634100	All right.
634100	638620	So nicotine, I learned in biology class, I thought I remembered hearing this.
638620	640660	I thought nicotine was the carcinogen.
640660	645020	I thought that nicotine is a molecule that's shaped like a roof shingle that flies like
645020	651500	a karate star into your lung tissue and has a one in a billion chance of cleaving your
651500	654420	cellular membrane and into your DNA.
654420	659360	And just like the reason why, where you eventually get lung cancer is because every puff you
659360	664660	inhale of nicotine is a one in a zillion, billion, zillion, billion, billion chance
664660	669140	of one of these throwing stars, like cutting the exact part of your double helix that makes
669140	674980	the cell go, I want to make more sales pretty much no nicotine in and of itself.
674980	677460	That was a, that was a white trash guy, not a black guy.
677460	678460	Well done.
678460	682460	Um, nicotine in and of itself is fighting cancer is not a black caricature.
682460	683460	It's terrible.
683460	688460	It's a, it's a dirty white, poor person, a little racist, was not racist.
688460	692740	What is the, what is the, what is the black, uh, enemy of the human genome?
692740	697620	Oh, do you want to hear black, black human genome, what he would sound like exactly.
697620	702420	I intend to create, I intend to do so responsibly.
702420	705940	Sounds like a, he sounds like a very articulate gentleman.
705940	711540	I woke up at nine this morning, I brushed my teeth, I have a, I have a wife that I love
711540	719900	very much and I oversee the reproduction of various viscera to keep the human body alive.
719900	721700	What nationality is diabetes?
721700	722700	Uh, Italian.
722700	723700	Diabetes.
723700	728700	Oh, you never eat, oh, I have a cake.
728700	732180	I would have thought Hawaiian, I don't know.
732940	733940	Diabetes.
733940	734940	Or Greek.
734940	735940	It seems great.
735940	736940	It seems pretty great.
736940	745860	Diabetes stole sugar from Mount Olympus and was chained to a giant cake and an eagle sticks
745860	747460	a dipstick into his liver.
747460	753700	Now you, you said that Aaron, Aaron came into your, a couple, a couple of, uh, a couple
753700	757260	of Greek mythology majors just had a conniption fit.
757260	758260	I don't think that's right.
758260	759260	I don't know.
759500	760820	He remembers the eagle.
762820	766140	So you said that Aaron got into your bed and she, she was singing the praises of e-cigarettes
766140	767140	or what?
767140	770220	She came home with a bag cause she wouldn't get antibiotics so she was, she'd, she'd
770220	773020	She'd like to stop at the gas station and buy one of the ones there.
773020	775980	I don't know where, I don't know where she was, but she came home and so, and I was just
775980	779900	going like, I'm, I, I, like I said, I'm eight years, no smoking.
779900	784420	And I just, I just flipped out like an, like a, you know, it was like, I started Googling,
784420	788260	even though I had writing to do, which is ironic because while I was Googling, there
788260	792460	was this event that I'm describing earlier that I, I was like, but I wasn't Googling
792460	793460	the right things.
793460	798540	Um, I, I, I, I just was like, like, like I was typing in things like the truth about
798540	799540	e-cigarettes.
799540	803100	You know, that always leads you somewhere nice.
803100	806780	The bottom line right now is it's basically like, it kind of smells like a smoke fog machine
806780	807780	for a second.
807780	811220	Like she's in bed next to me and she, she has this little plastic stick that she sucks
811220	815180	on in the unless you put your face in it, you're not going to get the scent of whatever
815180	816820	the hell they flavored it with.
816820	817820	And it's called vaping.
818380	822180	And the kids are doing it and they, they had to make a stupid verb out of it.
822180	823180	I hate that term.
823180	824180	Really?
824180	825180	I'm hanging out on my desk vaping.
825180	826180	What are you doing?
826180	827180	It's the worst.
827180	833300	Wait, can you put like, uh, drugs in them or can you put like weed or that's probably,
833300	834300	that's the worst thing.
834300	837460	You know, like you could probably put hash or if you hacked one, you could probably,
837460	838540	some of that hash oil.
838540	839540	You probably could.
839540	843420	Like I don't, I'm just worried that they're going to ruin it for normal nicotine people.
843420	846500	They have those, they have those hitters that are basically an e-cigarette, but you, you
846500	848260	load them with hash oil.
848260	851300	I was talking to someone who was a pot smoker bat and they were like, man, no, cause like,
851300	853860	you know, you cigarettes, like pot smokers, they're botanists, man.
853860	855820	We're not electronics, not so much.
855820	861820	Well, I, I, this botanist, uh, got a hold of one of these hash oil things and I'm sure
861820	866060	I like sucking on a pen and putting it down and enjoying Zardoz.
866060	868260	That's what it takes, right?
868260	869260	One, two, three.
869260	871260	Wait, wait, you're on hash during Zardoz?
871260	872260	No, no.
872260	873260	That would be the worst.
873260	874260	I was about to be so jealous.
874260	876260	I was sober watching it and that was, yeah.
876260	877260	I watched it.
877260	880180	I watched it sober as a judge last night and it was a bummer.
880180	881780	All right.
881780	882780	Tangent free night.
882780	885780	Let's thank Tyler and get him out of here.
885780	890100	The truth about e-cigarettes.
890100	891100	No tangents.
891100	892100	We're going to have an orderly night.
892100	893540	That was a brief one.
893540	899780	So, so Aaron is convalescing, but she wanted, she wanted me to let you guys know.
899780	905260	And I quote, and I don't know if this is because the, uh, tetanus has gotten to her brain or,
906260	908580	or her e-cigarettes have been hacked.
908580	911820	I feel like moving in with me is doing weird things with her brain chemistry.
911820	917060	She said, if any of you are getting married, she will make you a free wedding cake.
917060	918060	Aaron's based.
918060	919060	She's cake crazy.
919060	925780	Every 100% of the last 11 times I've been to your place has been a new cake.
925780	926780	And then I went down.
926780	927780	I came.
927780	930800	She literally has made two cakes now that are miscellaneous cakes.
930800	934860	The first one we edited it out of the last episode because it wasn't very compelling
935460	936460	audio.
936460	937460	I got a cake for his birthday.
937460	938460	Her.
938460	940340	It was just, she just wrote, like, she, she meant she'll make a cake.
940340	945520	And then at a loss, she'll write like, yay, exclamation point on the cake and then give
945520	948140	it to me and go, bring this to work and I'll bring it to work.
948140	949140	And I'll go, yay.
949140	953620	So how old does she get 2028?
953620	955300	That's too young for dementia, right?
955300	961340	Uh, I mean, yeah, I mean, it's not too young to invent a new thing to be brain.
961340	966860	Evan has, uh, as I believe we've spoken of, uh, his Game of Thrones party at Danadu.
966860	970980	And, uh, we went, we're there last night and she, Erin makes cakes that are drawing.
970980	971980	Last week was a Peter Dinklage.
971980	978060	She made a Dinklage that looked a lot like Cobain, but last night she made a whip ass
978060	979060	Jon Snow.
979060	980060	Even I knew it was Jon Snow.
980060	981060	I'm like, good Jon Snow?
981060	982060	That was a good Jon Snow.
982060	983060	Good Jon Snow.
983060	984060	Uh, she's getting good.
984060	988340	But I went down to the kitchen to get some water and, or get a glass for some water.
988340	991660	And there's four other boxes of unmade cake mix.
991660	994940	There's, there's, there's, there's proto cakes already.
994940	995940	She's losing her mind.
995940	996940	She had two words.
996940	997940	Citizen Kane.
997940	998940	Remember Jigsaw puzzles?
998940	999940	Oh yeah.
999940	1000940	Well you did call it Danadu.
1000940	1001940	Yeah.
1001940	1002940	It's too close.
1002940	1005860	I like to stand in the corner while she's making cakes in the shadows and go, why are
1005860	1008780	you doing that?
1008780	1009780	Another cake.
1009780	1013820	I make them because I like to make them.
1013820	1014820	You should change the language.
1014820	1016660	And you make a cake and then people eat it.
1016660	1018940	What's the point?
1018940	1020100	There's empires out there.
1020100	1021100	Newspapers to own.
1021100	1024100	I haven't seen Citizen Kane on a long time.
1024100	1026620	I don't know what he said there.
1026620	1029060	Uh, all right.
1029060	1030060	Moving right along.
1030060	1031060	Uh, let's knock this one off the list.
1031060	1033300	Hey Alex, thank you for the Space Jam DVD.
1033300	1034300	Some guy named Alex.
1034300	1035300	Jeremy.
1035300	1036300	It was Jeremy wasn't it?
1036300	1037300	Jeremy.
1037300	1041620	I'm holding a Space Jam DVD with a, with a, with a star post that says Jeremy on it.
1041620	1043820	I don't, I have neither met nor heard of any of this.
1043820	1044820	I don't know what's going on.
1044820	1049340	Why did I get Alex out of Jeremy?
1049340	1051980	And I'm making fun of my girlfriend for making cakes.
1051980	1053300	All I do is destroy lives.
1053300	1054300	Wait, wait, wait.
1054300	1055300	So what are we supposed to do?
1055300	1056300	Who's Jeremy?
1056300	1057300	Jeremy?
1057300	1058300	Are you here?
1058300	1059300	All right.
1059300	1060300	Alex, stand up.
1060300	1061300	You want a DVD?
1061300	1062300	No, I'm kidding.
1062300	1063300	Oh, Jeremy.
1063300	1064300	But you kept calling me on that other show.
1064300	1065300	Right.
1065300	1066300	Weird.
1066300	1067300	So that's why you're...
1067300	1068300	I don't know.
1068300	1069300	There must be some dot in my head that's connected.
1069300	1070300	Wait, so this is a gift to Dan?
1070300	1071300	No.
1071300	1072300	Who was talking about it on the other show?
1072300	1073300	You're supposed to do the show.
1073300	1074300	Oh, oh, oh.
1074300	1075300	Give it to her?
1075300	1076300	Yeah.
1076300	1082300	Oh, who was that girl's, who was the girl that came up and loved Space Jam?
1082300	1083300	It was your favorite movie.
1083300	1084300	Oh, fuck.
1084300	1085300	That was days ago.
1085300	1086300	I want to say Lizette.
1086300	1087300	No.
1087300	1088300	That was, that was, yes, no.
1088300	1089300	She's not here, is she?
1089300	1090300	I think it was...
1090300	1096300	There was a Space Jam apologist among you people, and so she'll turn up.
1096300	1097300	All right.
1097300	1098300	Well, why...
1098300	1099300	But Jeremy, you brought this for her?
1099300	1100300	Well, I brought it for the show.
1100300	1102300	Are you trying to fuck...
1102300	1103300	Space Jam?
1103300	1104300	Space Jam.
1104300	1109300	This is the most elaborate come-on I've ever seen in my life.
1109300	1110300	Well done.
1110300	1111300	He's trying to fuck Harmontown.
1111300	1112300	He's Goldberging.
1112300	1116300	Adam, hey, Adam, are you, are your brothers okay?
1116300	1118300	They're from, they're in Boston, aren't they?
1118300	1119300	Can we?
1119300	1120300	Yeah.
1120300	1121300	All right.
1121300	1123300	But don't, don't, don't pop the cork on all the Boston talk.
1123300	1125300	I'm going to bring up Kumail and talk about it.
1125300	1126300	Yeah.
1126300	1127300	Adam Goldberg, everybody.
1128300	1131300	All right, first things first.
1131300	1133300	There's a giant Velcro...
1133300	1134300	Back brace.
1134300	1135300	Back brace, okay.
1135300	1136300	It gets attached to the shoulder.
1136300	1137300	What happened?
1137300	1142300	Yeah, I, you know how I kept saying I had a job and I wasn't going to come to Harmontown
1142300	1143300	or anything?
1143300	1144300	Yeah.
1144300	1146300	Well, one of those is true, and one of those is false.
1146300	1152300	You're like both stories in the labyrinth.
1152300	1154300	The false one is you not coming here anymore.
1154300	1155300	Yeah.
1155300	1156300	You're right.
1156300	1159300	Because I had workman's comp and didn't get injured.
1159300	1161300	That was a tortured sentence.
1161300	1162300	Also had a true false.
1162300	1165300	My brothers are fine.
1165300	1173300	My college went into lockdown, and we had a domestic terrorism in my fair city, Boston,
1173300	1177300	which I'm not going to talk about until Kumail gets here.
1179300	1180300	Your role, not mine.
1180300	1184300	But your, were your brothers able to get a hold of you because it's like totally locked in?
1184300	1189300	Yeah, they just face, there's like so many other ways to connect to people that aren't
1189300	1190300	like cell phones.
1190300	1191300	Yeah, that's true, isn't it?
1191300	1193300	It's like, just got text, got an email, got all this stuff.
1193300	1197300	The police have put an I am lockdown on the city of Boston.
1197300	1199300	AIM is completely down.
1199300	1202300	ICQ is not working due to the high call volume.
1202300	1204300	Only emoticons are able to get through.
1204300	1206300	People are winking at each other.
1206300	1211300	I wanted, I posted on Facebook today that, oh my God, there's a tragedy in my hometown
1211300	1214300	and Facebook's like, do you want to add a smiley to this?
1214300	1219300	They're like, the three people have been vaporized by bombs in a place you used to go to get coffee.
1219300	1221300	How about a winky face?
1221300	1224300	That's Facebook's line, not mine.
1224300	1226300	I want that to be a jet pack.
1226300	1229300	I want it to be a battery pack.
1229300	1236300	For our listeners, Adam has taken off his gray hoodie and revealed what can only be described as a girdle.
1236300	1238300	I was going to say technically not a trust.
1238300	1240300	It's trust-like.
1240300	1246300	Before you took your hoodie off, I was about to ask you how you stay so thin.
1246300	1247300	Running from bombs.
1247300	1248300	No.
1248300	1250300	I can make that joke, my brother.
1250300	1252300	Adam, see, that's why I...
1252300	1254300	That's the one line you can't cross.
1254300	1255300	Also the finish line.
1255300	1256300	You can't cross.
1256300	1257300	Holy shit.
1257300	1259300	Hey-oh.
1259300	1260300	I can bear...
1260300	1261300	How many...
1261300	1267300	Will you please just put the pedal to the metal and do more Boston bombing things?
1267300	1268300	Boston bombing jokes.
1268300	1269300	Oh, yeah.
1269300	1270300	Just Fauzi Barrett.
1270300	1271300	They're going to sound it.
1271300	1272300	Just give it all.
1272300	1278300	It's really embarrassing for me because this has been 20 years since Boston's last race riot.
1278300	1279300	Oh.
1279300	1281300	Ah, it's a little embarrassing history for Bostonians.
1281300	1283300	Just connecting verbal dots.
1283300	1284300	Yeah, we should have...
1284300	1286300	There's people rolling around in agony.
1286300	1287300	Anyway...
1287300	1290300	And you're just like, this word reminds me of another word.
1290300	1298300	You also say Boston's last race riot with the sound of inevitability to the next one.
1298300	1304300	If you've seen how we've treated any athletic star who can't pass the paper bag test, you'd
1304300	1308300	know Boston is a good place for race riots.
1308300	1311300	Sounds like athletic race riot jokes.
1311300	1316300	Now, by the time this podcast airs, you will be able to assemble that last sentence by
1316300	1318300	going back several times.
1319300	1322300	Wait, are you saying you were involved in the...
1322300	1329300	Yeah, it's a tragedy, but at some point, as a comedian, your brain just automatically
1329300	1333300	makes terrible, jeselnechian jokes about it.
1333300	1335300	You just go the jeselnechian joke.
1335300	1340300	I mean, it's a tragedy, but to heap tragic comedy on top of it.
1340300	1341300	Yeah.
1344300	1346300	Bombs are bad, puns are worse.
1347300	1350300	I thought I'd come up here and bomb on the other...
1350300	1354300	I thought I'd come up here and show that not all the bombs are in Boston.
1354300	1355300	Thank you.
1355300	1356300	All right, Adam Goldberg.
1356300	1357300	Adam Goldberg.
1357300	1358300	It was worth a try.
1361300	1363300	Get well soon, would you?
1365300	1366300	Yo.
1367300	1368300	Oh, thank you.
1368300	1371300	Gentlemen, just compliment my haircut.
1371300	1372300	That was very pleasant.
1372300	1373300	Thank you, sir.
1373300	1375300	You're not so bad yourself.
1375300	1380300	That was an interesting social phenomenon Adam Goldberg embodied, which before the Internet,
1380300	1387300	before when I was a kid, I remember when this grade of national tragedy would happen.
1387300	1390300	My mind goes back to the space shuttle Challenger.
1390300	1395300	The next day on the playground, there's all this conversation about it, and then there's
1395300	1399300	the six jokes, and they're just awful.
1399300	1401300	Yeah, and they're vicious, too.
1401300	1404300	Well, are they vicious, or are they kind of like...
1405300	1406300	Here's the thing.
1406300	1408300	They're not funny enough to be okay.
1408300	1413300	If you're going to tell a funny joke after 9-11, it has to be a beautifully crafted joke.
1413300	1414300	They really remind me...
1414300	1416300	Like, Warren Thomas had a goodie.
1416300	1419300	Well, they have to be beautifully crafted to what end, though?
1419300	1422300	Because no one wants to actually laugh about it.
1422300	1426300	Like, if Oscar Wilde said something pithy about it, people are getting blown up.
1426300	1428300	It has to create release to go like...
1428300	1430300	It's not diminishing it.
1430300	1433300	It's saying, like, here's the pressure valve, and just for a second I go...
1433300	1434300	Right.
1434300	1435300	Just for a second.
1435300	1438300	There's a rodeo clown effect there.
1438300	1443300	But that's not an apt metaphor, because I think we all know that rodeo clowns are really
1443300	1448300	superior, kind of like bowl handlers.
1448300	1451300	Like, those are the real craftsmen, blah, blah, blah.
1451300	1453300	There's someone raising their hand.
1453300	1454300	Benign violation theory.
1454300	1455300	What's that?
1455300	1456300	Benign violation theory.
1456300	1458300	But would you like to come up with that?
1458300	1459300	Get the fuck up here with that, yeah.
1459300	1460300	It's a town meeting.
1460300	1463300	Harmon Sounds got new life breathed into it.
1463300	1464300	Yeah.
1464300	1468300	If you're going to say three words that interesting, you have to come up with...
1468300	1470300	What was the divine violation thing?
1470300	1471300	No, no, no.
1471300	1472300	Benign.
1472300	1473300	Benign?
1473300	1474300	Yeah.
1474300	1475300	Violation theory.
1475300	1479300	I think as a Harvard professor, I came up with this theory that in order for humor to
1479300	1482300	be funny, it has to be benign and deviant.
1482300	1485300	If it doesn't fulfill both of those things, it isn't funny.
1485300	1488300	Because if it's not benign, you see it as a threat.
1488300	1489300	Right.
1489300	1491300	And if it's not deviant, it's boring.
1491300	1492300	Deviant in which way?
1492300	1495300	Deviant as in...
1495300	1497300	From the accepted path.
1497300	1499300	So can you give us a for instance?
1499300	1503300	Can you pull one out?
1503300	1509300	So to continue this theory, I think we can also put benign but deviant things are easier
1509300	1515300	to do when they're not in the face of something as sobering as a national tragedy.
1515300	1520300	And that is why when these very serious things happen that everyone can agree are very serious
1520300	1523300	and painful, actually the worst kind of...
1523300	1530300	And when I say worst, I don't mean the most caustic, the most tough crowd with Colin
1530300	1531300	Quinney.
1531300	1539300	I mean the dumbest, the fuzzy barriest, like punniest, dumbest kind of jokes come out because
1539300	1547300	in order to prove that they're benign in the face of flesh being torn and the unignorable
1547300	1554300	stink of political motivation in the air and not to mention the political motivation that's
1554300	1557300	going to be cultivated from it.
1557300	1562300	In order to be benign, you have to be pretty stupid.
1562300	1566300	Like the joke has to be just dumb as bricks.
1566300	1571300	Well, let's consider everybody loves Raymond.
1571300	1573300	Not funny to most of us, right?
1573300	1575300	I've actually never seen an episode of it.
1575300	1581300	Well, there is a demographic that sees his humor as deviating from the norm.
1581300	1583300	Yeah, it's kind of scary.
1583300	1589300	Let's all pray for them tonight.
1589300	1590300	You did it.
1590300	1594300	That was benign and deviant, you did it.
1594300	1595300	I'm sorry.
1595300	1596300	Continue.
1596300	1597300	I didn't mean to derail you.
1597300	1598300	No, no, no.
1598300	1599300	That was the only example I could think about.
1599300	1600300	I'm sorry.
1600300	1601300	Well, wait.
1601300	1603300	No, but it seems like you were building to a point and I...
1603300	1604300	No, no, no, no.
1604300	1606300	You're just saying that it's a contextual thing.
1606300	1607300	It's a subjective thing.
1607300	1608300	Well, the thing is...
1608300	1614300	To my mom, deviation is like not kneeling and my mom doesn't kneel anywhere.
1614300	1618300	I just made it to my mythical mom, to grandma.
1618300	1619300	Yeah.
1619300	1622300	There's no joke that you could say that would be funny to everybody across the board in the
1622300	1623300	face of a crisis.
1623300	1624300	Okay.
1624300	1625300	What was your name, sir?
1625300	1626300	Bill.
1626300	1627300	Bill.
1627300	1628300	Okay.
1628300	1629300	Bill.
1629300	1630300	Well, let's thank Bill because we got so much things out.
1630300	1631300	Thank you, Bill.
1631300	1632300	All right.
1632300	1635300	It's the theory of benign deviance.
1635300	1637300	I mean, yeah.
1637300	1638300	Yeah.
1638300	1651460	It's interesting because the jokes get dumber when the tragedy is unmistakable, that theory
1651460	1652460	such as it is a theory.
1652460	1653460	Yeah.
1653460	1654460	I want to say this.
1654460	1655660	By no means do I want this to be funny.
1655660	1656660	It's not a joke.
1656660	1657660	I'm not saying it's a joke.
1657660	1659380	I do not want to joke as a response to this.
1659380	1663420	But there are people when you watch the footage of the runners, the marathon runners coming
1663420	1667460	across the finish line, some of them are just coming across the finish line when things
1667460	1668620	go boom.
1668620	1670260	And for a split second, their hands are still in the air.
1670260	1671500	They don't know if that's fireworks going off.
1671500	1673700	They don't know what the fuck is going on.
1673700	1674700	Other people are in front of it.
1674700	1675700	They see debris.
1675700	1678020	They're running for the other side of the street.
1678020	1681220	But also there are people that are probably going to finish in an hour who like they've
1681220	1684780	been running for three or four hours and they're going to say, sorry, that three or
1684780	1688860	four hours that you ran, like the marathon is over.
1688860	1693580	That trickles back along a huge route, a mile long thing.
1693580	1695140	It's a very weird thing to go on.
1695140	1696140	How do you mean?
1696140	1699780	There's going to be somebody that's just going to like at some point you're running
1699780	1701220	and it's going to stop you.
1701220	1702220	Marathon's over.
1702220	1703220	Oh, yeah.
1703220	1704620	Somebody blew up the finish line.
1704620	1708140	The experience of, yeah, I hadn't even thought about that.
1708140	1715820	The subjective experience of a person who is, who is a mile from, who's, who's run,
1715820	1716820	you know, 22.
1716820	1720940	And they have every right and reason to believe that what they're undergoing is like this
1720940	1721940	cataclysmic experience.
1721940	1722940	I'm not saying that.
1722940	1726740	I'm just saying that like there's people that your minds are wobbly, your legs are wobbly.
1726740	1730820	I think it was a guy that falls down on that footage and I think it's, in my mind, I don't
1730820	1732380	know, it didn't look like he was hit.
1732380	1735460	It just looks like, you know, people's legs are about to give at that moment anyway.
1735460	1736460	And he heard this big shock.
1737260	1740780	I don't know if it's he or she, actually, and someone just kind of tumbled to the ground.
1740780	1744500	But also there are people that I will say the thing that you said you're not saying,
1744500	1745940	which is interesting to me.
1745940	1753660	I'll be the bad guy and talk about this because I remember 9-11.
1753660	1758580	And I remember this, please appreciate my candor and don't punish me for communicating
1758580	1763060	something about human psychology because the easiest thing in the world for me would be
1763060	1766380	to not share this with you and be a good person.
1767300	1773300	But the year that 9-11 happened, there were Emmys, same as every year.
1773300	1780500	Only the year that 9-11 happened because there was 9-11, the Emmys were downplayed.
1780500	1782660	There was no red carpet, for instance.
1782660	1784780	It's funny how that national psychology happens.
1784780	1787820	It's like, yeah, I guess it makes sense, like what are we supposed to do?
1787820	1789460	9-11 just happened.
1789460	1795220	Let's not roll out, let's not watch Jennifer Aniston, like, talk about what she's wearing.
1795220	1800260	Not because it has anything to do with anything, but just because it just doesn't seem right.
1800260	1804100	And I agree with that, and it's odd.
1804100	1809180	And yet I live in this universe where it's like, you know, like, that's the most important
1809180	1811700	thing in the world, the Emmys.
1811700	1817820	And my mind went there, it was like when I thought about all the writers who were nominated
1817820	1823420	and not nominated and nominated hoping to win or not having a chance to win, it's like
1823420	1825860	their lives building to this point.
1825860	1832460	And then this 9-11 thing, like making their Emmys, like not a thing.
1832460	1837900	I was just thinking of like, it's not a proud thing, it's just like humanity consists of
1837900	1838900	two things.
1838900	1844820	It consists of a big throng of like a gelatinous, like societal collective, and it exists of
1844820	1849020	all these little remarkable little snowflakes with their own little egos and their own little
1849020	1850020	motivations.
1850260	1853980	Speaking of motivation, whatever the motivation was for the people or persons that did this
1853980	1861420	thing, what a fucking crappy thing to do is bomb the stands at the finish line of a race
1861420	1866060	where it's going to almost certainly be friends and family, like people that mean nobody any
1866060	1867060	fucking harm at all.
1867060	1872660	Well, where are you going to, I mean, I just like, I mean, like, I don't know, I don't
1872660	1876340	know why I'm having that, like, like, like, well, it's just another funny thing that I
1876340	1877340	wanted to talk about.
1877340	1880940	I was standing at the foot of Erin's bed, she's got her leg laid up with her, you know,
1880940	1885340	she's going to take antibiotics and not come to the show, and we, she mentioned Boston
1885340	1892820	and I was out the door and like, so nobody knows what's going on, and I suddenly realized
1892820	1894540	that I had an opinion.
1894540	1897780	I'm telling you, I'm completely sealed off from the entire thing.
1897780	1902940	I could tell you in 15 seconds everything that I've actually heard about this, because
1902940	1906420	even in the green room I was telling people don't, because I think it's actually weird
1906420	1912340	that I'm, like, I was in a bubble today, and I only know multiple bombs went off at
1912340	1917820	the finish line of the Boston Marathon and scores, hundreds of people are horribly injured
1917820	1921460	and there's all kinds of gore all over the internet and that three people are confirmed
1921460	1925580	dead and one of them's a kid and I, so I know all that and I know that there's, that everybody's
1925580	1928700	trying to figure out what the fuck happened and that there's a huge blackout and cell
1928700	1932380	phones are blacked out because cell phones can be used to activate bombs, and then I
1932380	1936060	found out in the green room that there's more bombs.
1936060	1940060	But I want to bring Camille up in a second because he specifically, like, he was the
1940060	1941460	opposite of me today.
1941460	1946580	He was all over, he was on Twitter and he was telling me before the show about how his
1946580	1950420	truth, his subjective truth was changing every 30 minutes.
1950420	1955300	But I just wanted to say one thing, like, that I thought was so strange psychologically
1955300	1959940	as I was standing at the foot of our bed about to leave for the show and Aaron mentioned
1959940	1965100	something about Boston and I must have said something like, do they know, do they know
1965100	1966100	who did it yet?
1966100	1967740	And she's like, no.
1967740	1973700	And I said something like, like, like, I don't know, this doesn't seem very Al Qaeda-ish.
1973700	1977140	And I'm like, like, what am I, Bruce Wayne now?
1977140	1980860	Who the fuck do I, what am I talking about?
1980860	1982380	I just think that's such a funny thing.
1982380	1987340	I had to turn the news off because in that whirlwind right after a big event happens,
1987340	1992100	it's an earthquake or it's a robbery or, you know, Charlie Sheen makes a phone call
1992100	1993100	or whatever.
1993100	1994420	Nobody has any facts.
1994420	1995420	So it's a lot of alleged.
1995420	2000740	But then in my brain immediately without any, like, like five seconds and my brain chemistry
2000740	2004460	is immediately I'm Val Kilmer sitting in front of a bank of computers, this isn't the Riddler
2004460	2005460	style.
2005460	2008380	Like, why am I on the case?
2008380	2012060	Why is my brain on the case at all?
2012060	2013660	Dumb, stupid.
2013660	2017060	Why isn't your brain not on the case?
2017780	2019700	Why in this comic book world?
2019700	2022060	Why isn't my brain on the case of who can I help, who can I...
2022060	2023060	Who do you think did it?
2023060	2025660	I'm not being glib again.
2025660	2029860	If you had to guess right now, what do you think is the motive or are the people responsible?
2029860	2034620	And I'm not being, I mean, I, it's, and Erin said this in response, she said, she said
2034620	2039180	kind of a, like, like, she was like intrigued by the thought process of like, because it's
2039180	2045660	too specific, you know, it's too, it's like, like, you, like, we should bring Kumail up.
2045660	2049940	I think, I think, I think, I think we want to talk to him about this.
2049940	2059340	I didn't want to go too much further down this road because I feel like I, I, I, I,
2059340	2064100	I, I, I, I, all of a sudden the human mind is incredible.
2064100	2070500	I mean, we're cavemen that we're able to create stories out of the fact that we live and die.
2070500	2075180	In a vacuum, we do what cheetahs and giraffes and mosquitoes do.
2075180	2078460	We come into a world, we realize we're in it and then we go away.
2078460	2086140	But unlike giraffes and cheetahs and mosquitoes, in the span of time that we're here, we go,
2086140	2088300	oh, you hear that thunder?
2088300	2089740	That thunder's Zeus.
2089740	2092300	He's been roller skating again.
2092300	2094180	And the kids go, what's the roller skating?
2094180	2098980	And we go, well, roller skating is what happens when we just fill our heads with our brains
2098980	2105140	branch out and we create beauty and poetry and dancing and festivals and we reach out.
2105140	2106140	We touch each other.
2106140	2107140	We save each other's lives.
2107140	2108420	We take bullets for each other.
2108420	2114980	But we also, we go like, well, you know, black people, you know, you put one on a drive through
2114980	2119460	and you know, you know, we have that, that's a new one.
2119460	2120460	That same computer.
2120460	2121460	Come out.
2121460	2122460	You haven't heard?
2122460	2123940	I didn't know about black people in drive throughs.
2123940	2126300	You've never been behind a black person in a drive through.
2126300	2128300	What are they doing?
2128300	2131820	What are the black people doing in drive throughs?
2131820	2134500	I wish I could tell you, but we got so much to do tonight.
2134500	2135500	No tangents.
2135500	2136500	No tangents.
2136500	2138340	Shoot it next week.
2138340	2143220	It's interesting because the mic stand broke off.
2143220	2148820	First of all, to answer your question, I hope it's a crazy white guy or like an Asian lady
2148820	2153260	because we haven't seen them do just for the novelty of it.
2153260	2158140	And also I just don't want it to be a brown person again.
2158140	2160380	I really don't.
2160380	2162620	What horse do you have on this race?
2162620	2166780	I just want any of the horses that are not brown.
2166780	2167780	I don't know.
2167780	2168780	Are they winning the race?
2168780	2169780	What's going on?
2169780	2173820	First of all, all my race riot puns have been taken.
2173820	2178060	Yeah, so that's, that's a real thing.
2178060	2179060	If you are.
2179060	2182900	Well, here's the thing is like, if it's an, if it's like a crazy white guy, then it's
2182900	2184300	just a crazy white guy.
2184300	2190180	If it's a crazy brown guy, then it's a fucking conspiracy and all it turns this whole thing.
2190180	2191740	I just wanted to be not.
2191860	2197220	I was thinking how frustrating it would be if you were just like a McVey, you know, bomber
2197220	2201180	manifesto kind of crazy guy who just happens to be from Saudi Arabia.
2201180	2205220	He'd be so, because everyone's like, Oh yeah, of course he's Al-Qaeda.
2205220	2207620	He's like, no, I've got my own thing going on.
2207620	2210100	He's like read my manifesto.
2210100	2211100	You mean the Quran?
2211100	2213340	No, I don't even, I don't know.
2213340	2214340	I'm an atheist.
2214340	2216340	No, my mom gave it to me.
2216340	2217340	I'm not.
2217340	2220180	Honey bees are going to take over the hummingbirds.
2220260	2222660	I'm way crazier than you think I am.
2222660	2226580	It's not an institution, institutionalized craziness.
2226580	2230100	But if you're crazy, if you're a crazy manifesto guy that lives in Saudi Arabia, but you're
2230100	2232820	also lazy, you're like, I'm on easy street.
2232820	2233820	I walk right into this one.
2233820	2234820	I do whatever.
2234820	2236460	You know, you know what this vein of gold is.
2236460	2238460	It's benign and deviant.
2238460	2246340	It's a safe pocket away from anyone mistaking us for not, you know, having our prayers and
2246340	2248500	grief with the, with the families of the loved ones.
2248500	2249500	Sorry, I ruined it.
2249660	2254900	But it makes sense what you're saying, what Adam was doing, when you make like base jokes
2254900	2259500	when something big, what you perceive to be big happens, it's because you're trying to
2259500	2260500	make sense of the world.
2260500	2263420	It's the same as saying that thunder is loose, you know, you're trying to put structure on
2263420	2264420	it.
2264420	2267860	So if something happens that you can't understand, well, if you make a joke about it, then it
2267860	2270500	becomes smaller, something you can process, something you can have.
2270500	2274420	The interesting thing that I think is really interesting about that, well, everything's
2274420	2275420	interesting about it.
2275420	2277580	Why do I have to point out one thing that's interesting about it?
2277580	2283620	But the thing that captivates me about it is that it's a channel to accountability.
2283620	2289340	A six year old on a playground making a joke about Liberace dying of AIDS or Rock Hudson
2289340	2293020	when I was a kid, it was like AIDS was being invented and then there were all these Rock
2293020	2297140	Hudson died and there were all these weird jokes about, you know, dick sucking an AIDS
2297140	2302940	and but you know, it's just like, it was like cooties like became a real fun thing and insensitivity
2302940	2306820	run rampant and then the space shuttle Challenger when I was 12 blew up and then just like,
2306820	2307820	what does NASA stand for?
2307820	2311860	Oh, a variety of hilarious things that all have to do with not, you know, appreciating
2311860	2313220	the fact that seven people blew up.
2313220	2320740	But the interesting thing about that is that it all has the same, knocking on wood, not
2320740	2326940	walking under a ladder, black cats crossing your path, it's superstition and religion
2326940	2335220	and benevolence and hatred, cruelty, politics, YouTube comment sections.
2335220	2341580	Humanity unlike cheetahs and giraffes and eel and mosquitoes, we reach these tendrils
2341580	2348140	out into a completely chaotic universe that for all intents and purposes, for every signal
2348140	2352740	that it sends to us, doesn't give a fuck at what happens.
2352740	2354660	You can't control when it rains.
2354660	2356460	You don't know who's going to get cancer.
2356460	2361820	You don't know why Ugg dropped dead and and and blood blood didn't.
2362700	2369700	But we insist upon reaching out to the world and I don't think it's like we we characterize
2369700	2373420	it by going like, oh, we are we're afraid of everything we don't understand, so we try
2373420	2374420	to make sense of it.
2374420	2375500	OK, granted.
2375500	2381380	But the flip side of that coin trying to make sense of the unknown is you know, it's a lot
2381380	2385420	easier to hide from the unknown, whether you know, I'm not saying it's a bad thing.
2385420	2386420	No, no, no, I'm not.
2386420	2387420	I'm not correcting you on anything.
2387420	2388420	I'm not arguing.
2388420	2391780	I'm just like, like, like, this is amazing, like, like, like, like, like we wouldn't
2391780	2398820	we we are like when a little kid makes a joke about the space shuttle blowing up, that
2398820	2400300	little kid doesn't know it.
2400300	2406460	But his unconscious brain is reaching out to the world and claiming responsibility for
2406460	2408940	seven people blowing up in a space shuttle.
2408940	2417060	That little child is because is apotheosizing, if that's a word, he's becoming God.
2417060	2421100	He's going like, well, this thing happened and here's what I got to say about it.
2421100	2424020	Junus and butt butts.
2424020	2428980	We are we are when we talk about like your experience on Twitter today.
2428980	2439420	Oh, it was just weird because I so I was driving back from Big Sur today and what a life.
2439420	2441980	Yeah, geez, it's rough.
2441980	2446620	I was driving back and just sort of like you were flying back in a private jet.
2446620	2449060	You were driving back like like any old asshole.
2449060	2450060	Yeah.
2450060	2452340	I mean, he's probably gone a little, sir.
2452340	2453820	He knows what he's doing.
2453820	2458540	I just wanted to drop that I can afford some of the hotels in Big Sur right now.
2458540	2459540	And guess.
2459540	2463940	Well, but even the trees are bigger out there.
2463940	2464940	Everything's awesome.
2464940	2466380	It's like heaven on earth.
2466380	2467380	So I'm driving back.
2467380	2468380	It really is.
2468380	2469380	It really is.
2469380	2473860	Big Sur, like, first thing I wanted to do is write a movie about a guy wanting to write
2473860	2477940	a movie about writing a movie like this feels like every shitty meta.
2477940	2480140	Yeah, there's no perspective there.
2480140	2483380	It's all like we are clearly but what I want to know is that all I know is I want to be
2483380	2484380	a writer.
2484380	2485380	Yeah.
2485380	2486380	Look at all these trees and dirt.
2486380	2490620	I think it ties in well to what you were saying is that part of I think what we went because
2490620	2492020	our brains are so smart.
2492020	2493020	We're trying.
2493020	2497900	It's all about power and control and control is predictability saying why thunder is happening
2497900	2499700	is because Zeus is angry.
2499700	2501940	Why did certain things happen because these other things happen.
2501940	2502940	So I was on Twitter.
2502940	2504720	I didn't have access to like radio.
2504720	2508920	So the only thing I had was like just refreshing Twitter over and over and see and like you
2508920	2512440	would see like something small would get reported and then someone would hear it.
2512440	2516160	And then because it's hundreds of people on Twitter repeating it, it would become the
2516160	2517160	truth.
2517160	2521520	So at some point it was that some Saudi national was the guy.
2521520	2523800	And so then that became the truth for like a half hour.
2523800	2528240	I was like, fuck, my people are at it again, you know, and that became the truth.
2528240	2532240	But it's also that's also part of people being like it would I think most people are like
2532240	2537560	it would make more make most sense is if it is all kind of then it's a threat we already
2537560	2538560	have.
2538560	2539960	We know what that is.
2539960	2540960	It sucks.
2540960	2541960	But that's what that is.
2541960	2546240	So people there was like a sense of relief almost people were like tweeting that because
2546240	2550800	I said I hope it's a white guy just because I think that's inherently not politicized
2550800	2556600	and people would respond to me like sort of like like bragging that like look it's one
2556600	2560800	of your people like I got a ton of people what do you mean?
2560800	2566040	I said I hope it's a crazy white guy most people understood and so and so and so you
2566040	2570600	entered into an unspoken almost like like if you're watching The Bachelor with somebody
2570600	2574160	and going like I hope he gives the flower to Cynthia instead of Veronica users just
2574160	2578600	like an automatic kind of I told you yeah a lot of people are like well sorry to burst
2578600	2583160	your bubble I swear someone said that and then linked me I'm like are you is there a
2583160	2587240	glee that it's that you think it's like a guy from the Middle East and I think there
2587240	2591560	really is a little bit because that's a known threat and that's a way to compartmentalize
2591560	2595800	and control the situation or at least have some power over it is no like oh we know these
2595800	2600840	are the bad guys it's Dr. Doom again you know right that's why like people even in movies
2600840	2605480	like superhero movies people like when it's like Riddler or whatever they don't like like
2605480	2612000	who's the fuck is this new guy I want it to be a new Dr. Doom because I don't want I don't
2612000	2616240	want to live in a world where I mean as always we're speaking about the cartoon parts of
2616240	2619400	our brains that are thinking these things yeah first of all why do we think we know
2619400	2622920	things second of all why do we want certain things of our other things that's what's interesting
2622920	2628320	to me given no no none of us are in forensics none of us are in politics none of us are
2628320	2636040	like but we all have opinions we all have theories and as I as I was saying I I'm like
2636040	2643560	a weird guinea pig in this experiment because I knew nothing what's interesting in nothing
2643800	2649960	immediately had opinions and leads and where you start your investigation but the the joker
2649960	2655320	usually leaves a clue at the scene there were no cards found so it wasn't him but it's true
2656040	2660760	and my girlfriend called me on it said like because because it would be weird if Al Qaeda
2660760	2667160	loved like like was so into something as specific as a Boston marathon and I was like yeah I yeah I
2667240	2673400	guess it's what am I like an Al Qaeda expert I'm a man hunter I'm in the mind of my enemy
2673400	2679400	but it's okay two things one it doesn't seem like their style whatever that is too what does it
2679400	2684040	mean like what you know their style is airplanes going into a building that no longer exists
2685000	2688680	the scope is a little smaller unless unless it's got fucked up I mean I think it was supposed to
2688680	2693720	be a bigger event well that's why it sucks as if it's one guy who just happens to middle eastern
2693800	2697320	who's like I'm just gonna do this one thing on man but the thing what you were saying I want to say
2697320	2702440	this real quick what you knew just from the fourth sentence is what all of us know but if you're
2702440	2707400	following the the news cycle you're just like things happen to become truth and then it's false
2707400	2711080	and it's truth and then it's false but all the things you said which is like three people died
2711080	2715800	there's how many people are injured there's what happened that is all we know still right that is
2715800	2722040	all we know so you don't know anything here's a really weird question what's more racist
2724280	2728760	this or that the whole the whole the whole audience is gonna leaned in imperceptibly
2730840	2736200	is it more are you more racist and jingoistic or whatever phrase you want to use this is a half
2736200	2745080	of your grade you guys if you hope it was uh a uh middle easterner let's say I'm not even gonna
2745080	2752040	say al-qaeda i've just got you like like what you say like uh uh uh or or if you hope it was as you
2752040	2760520	say a crazy white guy be like as a as a as a as a liberal white 40 year old guy sitting in my
2760520	2767640	house in los angeles i my immediate hope and this is all instinctive and i'm being honest about it i
2767640	2772840	have no conscious like dot i didn't have time to connect any of these dots consciously this is what
2772840	2781240	happened in my brain chemistry when i heard the news i hope and hope that it is a crazy white guy
2781240	2787640	and i i haven't asked myself yet why i hope that part of it is self-preservation i want to have a
2787640	2794840	kid with erin and i don't want my kid to grow up in a that's your someone applying traveling back
2795720	2802600	he's like please erin made it after all yeah yeah yeah he's saying the penicillin works or whatever
2802600	2806920	adam goldberg applauded because he wants to have a kid that will come over to that kid's uh
2806920	2811880	playground uninvited and swing next to him and do puns based on the newest tragedy
2812840	2816840	i know where all the good water fountains are the thing is as my uncle had spina bifida and
2816840	2820440	he doesn't tend to go there but you know pipes is pipes i don't know
2820440	2828280	i think a crazy white guy is better well crazy white guy is clean and simple and it's just one
2828280	2834040	guy adventure film it's just one guy as opposed to a conspiracy or an ideology adam adam don't
2834040	2843880	blow us up don't blow us up please uh but but but am i i mean i i
2844520	2856680	am aren't i on a deeper noam chamskyan level more racist more part of the evil to hope that it
2856680	2865160	wasn't the visigoths that spit on the wall of rome why do you say that because i want to think
2865160	2870920	that they're gone because i i don't want them in the picture is it doesn't that make me don't i i
2870920	2875960	want to think i don't want to raise my child my beautiful rich white child
2877080	2882760	in a world where the legion of doom is still operative well i think this is what it is i
2882760	2886920	think you know the legion of doom is still operative right you know there's always going
2886920	2893080	to be when you're the most uh prosperous country in the world i think we all know a lot of stuff
2893080	2898200	that we don't consciously deal with sure sure but i think what would be good from my perspective i'll
2898200	2901480	tell you why i don't know what your perspective is my perspective it's good if it's not a white guy
2901480	2906040	is because i remember right after 911 happened and like the shit that people would say to me
2906040	2909720	on the street it's a very you know you think about yourself you personalize it i don't want
2909720	2914680	that stuff happening to me again i don't want that shit happening to me and i also if it's a white
2914680	2919960	guy is just one white guy if it's a brown guy it's all the brown people are somehow accountable
2919960	2924600	that's just how that's just how it happens that's how i see it happening on twitter that's just how
2924600	2930120	it happens i would see the looks it's interesting like i live in la i go to new york and but when i
2930120	2935960	go to ohio i get looks i swear i was like why is that guy looking at me i'm like oh right this
2935960	2941320	was a look i was used to 10 years ago but since i've moved to new york or la i don't get that look
2941320	2945800	anymore i wonder if it'll ever be a woman because we're just saying guy brown guy white guy this
2945800	2951800	guy that guy was like like it's never a woman that i think i mean a lot of suicide bombers are women
2951800	2957320	because they don't pat them down this is true i don't know why i have a smile it's just they only
2957320	2964520	reach up to the resistance the what erin said that's how they define the vagina tsa checkpoints
2964520	2969400	because she always opts out and when they they they tell her i'm going to reach up to the resistance
2969400	2974440	that's what they say when the guy puts his back i'm like you're telling me sister
2977640	2979240	viva la resistance
2982280	2990360	uh i don't know it's interesting like like like like i had a thought in my head and no i have none
2990360	2996280	of your motivations i i i your subjective motivations that's yeah that's a very subjective
2996280	3000520	very very close to home thing but i'm not saying they're noble at all they're not noble no no of
3000520	3006680	course that's that they they they noble or not like like like yeah because i could say well if
3006680	3011160	it's a guy that lived on franklin they'll close off franklin i won't be able to get to my haircut
3011160	3019000	appointment like yeah there's there's subjective uh uh reasons um and and you have a very subjective
3019000	3023880	reason that i don't have uh that you pointed out and beyond that though it's like like i
3023880	3029640	want to know in my white brain like why do i want it to be a white guy uh and i don't think it's
3029640	3035080	because i'm a hero i think it's less of a thread if it's a white guy uh yeah it just feels like
3035080	3039720	more like a comic book it feels like a bathroom movie it's like oh who's this guy people are just
3039720	3043960	strapping themselves up with a bunch of bunch of shit that everyone knows how to make a bomb
3044760	3049160	like we've covered like how to how to turn a cell phone into a weapon and you know like everybody
3049160	3052920	knows how to do it anybody's had a bad week you just go be a giant cocksucker and go out and blow
3052920	3057720	up a bunch of people it's like like that to me is worse than it than it like it's some dedicated
3057720	3062120	foe that we hate it was the penguin and we know that we're after this organization we can't get
3062120	3067080	him but we're trying our hardest one thing but if it's just every disenfranchised lunatic out there
3067160	3071960	that wants to go make a point uh that's what's freaky because there's something about
3071960	3077160	the fact that was a couple it appears to be a couple like low level trash can bombs that blew
3077160	3083160	up you know uh 150 people or whatever like that's kind of low scope you could go a lot bigger than
3083160	3088600	that but just by being a asshole and uh and now we're gonna you know like you said earlier dan
3088600	3093960	like it's now it's not just the politics that go into why someone does shit like that it's what
3093960	3099240	how that shapes the world we live in after this now and everything gets a little bit funkier as a
3099240	3102920	little bit more security cameras a little bit more now we're all watching each other and somebody
3102920	3108280	very weirdly but astutely pointed out today like like look we have just cameras everywhere it's a
3108280	3111480	finish line to race like everyone's got their phones out they're going to be going through all
3111480	3115640	that shit and if they're going to be looking for people of different ethnicity carrying backpacks
3115640	3119720	that's everybody there because lots of people from all over the world have their best friend
3119720	3123720	waiting at the finish line to give them a fucking power bar and some gatorade and some shit well i
3123720	3126600	thought what you were going to say is if they're going to be looking for people of different
3126600	3130760	ethnicity carrying backpacks they're going to they're going to be able to focus on those people
3130760	3134040	more easily than people who blend it in that were wearing backpacks but it's going to be
3134040	3137240	but the lineup is going to be long because it's a bunch of people holding knapsacks out there
3137240	3140840	and stuff like that so the other thing i want to say that i don't want this to be a political
3140840	3144520	statement at all i really don't and i said this on twitter and i got a lot of shit for it here's
3145160	3148760	also and i honestly i'm not trying to downplay anything fuck mexicans
3148760	3156520	no you deleted that one right no i did but honestly kind of fucked mexicans like
3157320	3162280	what's a gordita i don't get it like yeah how soft do your tacos have to get yeah
3162280	3167960	choco taco the ice cream taco crispiness yeah get your shit together your ice cream taco is
3167960	3173320	just a cone in a different shape we're all onto you if it turns out just give texas back give
3173320	3178280	us some tater tots or something you know what i mean if it turns out to be a mexican terrorist
3178280	3182440	that did this how does that affect the brown people's standpoint of yours oh we're cool
3184200	3190040	we're like good they're because of an eye shape and eyebrows yeah yeah yeah look how i'm gonna
3190040	3198520	say something horribly racist do it no no no no no one's gonna tell anybody anybody can hear this
3199400	3204200	here's the one thing i want to say is that i grew up in pakistan and the one thing americans don't
3204200	3209320	have that we had that americans have that we didn't have americans have this assumed sense of
3209320	3213960	security which is a huge privilege and it's a luxury and most of the people in the world
3213960	3220280	do not have that i know i didn't have it and just there were like those like bombs in iraq today
3220280	3225720	and 42 people died and i'm not saying you make the strategy smaller but anytime you read about
3225720	3231720	a bomb happening in another part of the world try and remember how it felt here to have that
3231800	3237080	happen too with three people dying in boston and how that must feel for the people over there i
3237080	3244280	think that's very important um people yeah well i think doesn't it feel weird or you get a plaza
3244280	3249400	then you feel like i didn't do that for a plaza i think when people you read about bombs all the
3249400	3254200	time bombs in syria and it always like just goes off you you think it's just like some other world
3254200	3257880	that's happening but that's the world and people you know people are living their lives there and
3257880	3261400	they love their kids and they like the food and they have you know favorite ice cream flavors or
3261400	3268200	whatever so just remember how awful this is and even now how distant you are from it and
3268200	3272520	how it happens to people all over the world and it's like a more of a fact of life for a lot of
3272520	3278840	people yeah absolutely i mean that's like yeah that that is the like the the the fucked up thing
3278840	3283800	is that when you're when you're when you're when you're a fat rich white 40 year old video game
3283800	3290040	loving wheat thin eating like community create vodka drinking community creating hanging out
3290040	3296520	doing your show and uh guy and um like you the only time these conversations happen is when this
3296520	3300840	stuff happens and it's when this stuff happens that you think that exact thought that i do that
3300840	3307400	i go oh i wonder how many people like uh you know i wonder what's going on on the planet yeah
3307400	3313400	uh and and why this is a a bigger deal and if i chime in with that sentiment at that point i
3313400	3318120	couldn't be a bigger hypocrite because it's like i i had my chance to give a fuck about whether
3318120	3323320	people lived or died and i didn't and then so then did gnome chompsky chime in when it happens
3323320	3328600	it's like you're the worst of both worlds because you're you're you're you're you're i'm eating
3328600	3334840	twinkies while everyone's dying and then school children get shot in a thing and then and then
3334840	3340440	if i choose to go well compared to what i mean it's not compared to it's not trying to downplay
3340440	3344520	anything it's just saying people were very rotted and feeling a lot of things and if i say
3344520	3349000	this two days from now people aren't going to be feeling that anymore the bubble of security will
3349000	3355320	be back if i if you say that today like what you feel right now how raw and hurt and painful it
3355320	3360120	feels that's like a real feeling for a lot of people in the world all the time and that's not
3360120	3364120	your downplay anything it just just because someone died somewhere else and those above
3364120	3369640	doesn't mean you can't enjoy your video games it just means you know just be aware it's a big world
3370280	3375720	and you know yeah well i do think yeah we've entered a world where we i mean i i'll tell
3375720	3382040	you it's gonna be a tough segue into dnd after this but a welcome one i don't think so at all i
3382040	3386200	think i i think i think if you listen to last week's recording you go like well there's an
3386200	3390120	example of nothing going wrong in the world and nothing being sensitive and it's just a shit piece
3390120	3395160	of shit show i thought the show was good did you think the show was bad i blame myself it's
3395160	3401640	just a boring turd laying on the sidewalk yeah i think so no it's because i forgot about
3402520	3405960	or it's because the microphone didn't work when i stepped up i don't know what it is i listen to
3405960	3410520	it when i edit it again you're trying to find like a reason for something happening you're
3410520	3415800	trying to put structure on it uh anyway but no but what i'm saying is no i like what i like about
3415800	3420600	harmontown is there's absolutely nothing about uh something horrible happening that precludes
3420680	3426760	the possibility of people uh being smart and fun and and and playing dnd touching each other
3426760	3432120	that's awesome no matter how bad things are dnd will always happen on harmontown but yeah
3432120	3436760	something something sticks in my in my head about what what you were saying that's a dwell on the
3436760	3444440	point i think you put it succinctly but but i like like there's a creature born in 73 and like
3445000	3449320	being raised throughout the 80s and like we've entered this world now it's a globalized world
3450120	3458840	and we were just so like conditioned now the news now now we don't even watch the news now it's
3458840	3464600	just we get we because we get all the information through this kind of trickle charge but it's still
3464600	3470920	a child of tom brokaw it's a child of cnn it's a child of all that old media and it's kind of like
3470920	3478840	like oh did you hear the news today and like the news in america it it it's like this proudly
3478840	3483800	isolationist kind of like heritage where we go like somehow before you've even gotten the
3483800	3491560	information and parsed it you like liberation fighters and bugga bugga bugga you don't you
3491560	3495480	don't like we don't know that they're human beings we have no idea what the fuck is going
3495480	3500440	on yeah uh and then the one the one thing that's never going to happen no i mean some maybe
3500440	3506200	somewhere but never on cnn and never on fox news never on the big news channels or outlets no one's
3506200	3511080	gonna say um like the president can't come on the air and go hey whoever did this call me up let's
3511080	3515640	talk about it let's like let's find out why you did this let's address the situation to be adults
3515640	3520200	like we don't want to like no one can do that we have to come down like a ton of like douchebag
3520200	3524600	bricks on everything now it has to be like we're gonna get him bring him to justice like yeah yeah
3524600	3529800	bring him to justice i saw that a lot like that is not a positive sentiment no no it's it's it's
3529800	3534520	it's just it's it's hang them high with clintus to it and it's like it like i i know that people
3534520	3537960	like when they're you're in pain everybody wants shit to stop but it's just like when everything
3537960	3543560	goes into yeah our little bubble got burst for a moment and everything has to change this giant
3543560	3548040	shift has to happen where like the constitution is going to get sodomized in an alleyway and
3548040	3553960	and uh and guess what as soon as that happens no more bombs like it's like it's fucking boom
3553960	3559480	but i really it is true america is in such a bubble it's a very unique situation and
3559480	3563160	these kinds of things sort of like you said put a little hole in the bubble
3563160	3567800	but you know try and remember this but the bubble will be back and next week
3567800	3571720	we won't give a shit about this and we'll be back robert williams will be here no one will give a
3571720	3579720	fuck uh zartos glad you guys watched it well let's get spencer up because he was there yeah spencer
3579720	3587160	come on up spencer everybody i think my oh i see what this contraption is
3587400	3593800	yes it's my fault that this thing was the worst was fiddling with this thing well
3596040	3604920	kamil was making points fiddling with the black iron staff the entertainer twirls his expert
3604920	3613960	fingers spencer came out swinging fuck you know how many of you have now seen zardoz
3614760	3619800	but by applause wow a good number of people now by zar applause
3622120	3627880	the pieces is evil yeah the gun is good that movie is wild man i have to say i've watched
3627880	3632040	that i think i've tried to watch that movie at least four times last night got through it didn't
3632040	3639080	fall asleep made it through zardoz yeah i don't i mean that movie like starts strong and it trickles
3639720	3644200	what's zardoz it uh what is zardoz that's a very good question we can start off
3644760	3649000	by answering the simple question what is zardoz wait well there's a there's a spoiler answer to
3649000	3654280	that question um you can play it to me because i've never seen it that doesn't matter just just
3654280	3659640	watch if you haven't seen it watch it i mean zardoz is an experience if you have seen it what
3659640	3667160	do we have to talk about it's like vietnam you're just like yeah i saw action i was in the shit
3669640	3675240	uh sean connery this is after he has been james bond yeah and
3677400	3681480	he i guess he had a reputation for why we're kind of not saying no to a lot of stuff but like
3681480	3685480	i think he i think everyone thought zardoz was going to be the real deal i think they thought
3685480	3690680	it was going to be a goodie right yeah there's no reason why i yeah i because what i find that
3690680	3695960	to be a very compelling movie for the first like 30 minutes i i i'm very very interested in like
3696840	3702360	there's a there's a there's a modern kind of cogent version of that movie that i think is
3702360	3709960	very important truly because like characters like gilgamesh in ancient stories like they're just
3709960	3716360	mortals who proceed into the realm of immortality and with questions with like shit to conquer they
3716360	3721000	go like why is this thunder clapping why did my friend die what what's going on why did the cheetah
3721000	3725240	jump on my my my my sister but it has only and they go to the ends of the earth they did
3725240	3729320	wait we're used to these stories where people climb bean stocks and we shrug it off we don't
3729320	3735320	we don't we don't look at that and go a bean stock that's stupid um like like like these
3735320	3740200	characters like they would just walk to the edge of the earth which we thought existed
3740200	3744120	and then they would jump off it and then like an eagle would pick them up and then they and the
3744120	3748040	eagle would go what are you doing and they're like you heard me motherfucker i don't want to talk to
3748040	3752680	apollo and they go all right i'm just following orders and like like you'd have interactions
3752680	3758280	with these confusing weird forces of of of that at the time were characterizations of something
3758280	3762920	that that people didn't understand they didn't invent monotheism yet we still thought that
3762920	3766920	everything unexplained had to have a different personality to it so like like we had this
3766920	3773000	amazingly we had these stories about it so sean connery in this thing he's a he he's this noble
3773000	3779160	savage that that uh he's not noble what are we talking about he he's a he's a primitive savage
3779160	3784680	who's who the stone head comes down every day and goes like i'm zordos here's your guns and
3784680	3790360	it pukes up all these guns to him and all his friends and he jumps in the mouth of the stone
3790360	3794440	head and reaches a ride with it there are these broodles that live out like i like these people
3794440	3799560	this sounds like the greatest movie yeah well it's the greatest it's the greatest the single greatest
3799720	3804280	beginning of a movie that's ever existed it starts off with a big head that looks like a big like
3804280	3810360	like gumdrop the stone gumdrop and it's got a big like kabuki face and it comes in and goes oh
3810360	3816280	i'm zordos the the gun is good the penis is evil and vomits guns and it says the penis is evil yeah
3816920	3823560	yes it says the penis shoots seed which creates life which which horrifies the earth the gun cleanses
3823560	3829560	it of life the gun is good the gun shoots death yeah yeah the penis shoots seed the gun shoots
3829560	3835560	death it's basically it's a it's i mean it's not a direct metaphor for u.s foreign policy but it's
3835560	3842520	like you know dan this is written right after the uh the gulf of thonkin affair it's an exploration
3842520	3847480	of any form of hegemony where like like because when it turns out is that these rich people who
3847480	3852200	live because because wait is this a spoiler now sean connery hitches a ride in this you can't
3852600	3857880	spoil this stone head in the first in the first 10 minutes of this movie this head that pukes guns
3857880	3861880	up to these poor people and says the penis is evil and says the penis is evil go shoot all the
3861880	3867480	people that are reproducing and it has glitter rhinestone eyes sean connery shoots the camera
3867480	3871800	turns and shoots the camera representing his self-awareness and then it goes
3871800	3880520	bada bada bada bada after after the title sequence fuck you roger more after the title
3880520	3885960	sequence sean connery emerges from a pile of grain inside the mouth of the stone head he has
3885960	3892440	hitched a ride inside his own god he shoots the guy who controls it the head rides on autopilot
3892440	3898520	back to the suburban silver lake village where this guy lived and in the first eight minutes
3898600	3903720	of this movie you're watching sean connery with bandolier straps on and a red wine cloth
3903720	3908680	fire and a red ponytail walking around a two-bedroom apartment and silver lake
3909480	3915720	looking through music boxes of a guy that created his world and going like like what the fuck and
3915720	3920440	he doesn't know his whole life has just been raping and shooting and he barely has language
3920440	3925640	for it and he's looking at the apartment of this guy it turns out all of life is just a fucking
3925960	3931640	but unlike gilgamesh zardas or sean connery's only blunder is that he emerged into a future
3931640	3937640	realized in the early 70s of filmmaking where it turns into a really bad community theater
3937640	3943080	production of pippin and everybody is getting new like doing a little hand gestures well
3943080	3946760	everything everything eventually falls apart there's too much too much commentary on what
3946760	3952600	was happening at at that point in the 70s it's too much too much like well yeah well boy pet
3952600	3958920	rocks today what's next pet boulders it's like well no one's gonna care about pet rocks in 2013
3958920	3963480	who were watching this but but but yeah like like transcendental meditation you know it's
3963480	3968200	like like obviously it was a it's a movie of its time but the thing that the thing that carries
3968200	3974920	through i think is a bunch of rich privileged people uh you know who have achieved immortality
3974920	3981240	which is all our goal and then these poor people are being created by them one person's in charge
3981240	3988840	of them like a commissioner or mayor is in charge of a basin of fucking or a controller um and uh
3988840	3994920	and one of them pops into the immortal world and is walking around and he's like sort of part
3994920	3999480	frankenstein part it's kind of matrixy too doesn't there and there and there are what there's a scene
3999480	4004920	where he's at a party and they're scanning his brain and there's his all his rapes and murders
4004920	4008520	that he's committed are on a screen behind him and all these fashionable but now are
4008520	4014120	rapes if it's a rape murder does that count as two or yes or is this not the important question
4014120	4018680	here uh and they're they're on like they're at an art gallery and they're commenting on it and
4018680	4023960	talking about it and well i think he's gauche well i think he's post gauche you know it's it's
4023960	4032120	and then they try to get him they're like uh this this this brutal uh uh savage uh that has a
4032120	4038920	vestigial quality uh that whether he can uh his penis can achieve two messings and become rigid
4038920	4044360	in a direction wait so they don't get boners yeah they can't they because they're immortal
4044360	4048280	they don't they don't need to reproduce they can't die so they cannot get a heart they're actually
4048280	4052680	immortal not like poetically immortal but they punish you if you fuck up in a society and you
4052680	4057080	do anything bad they can punish you by aging you five years and eventually you'll die no you
4057080	4061320	eventually you will you will never die eventually you'll be senile you become senile forever you'll
4061320	4065640	be an old person and then there's a renegade or a renegade yeah yeah yeah renegade is the
4065640	4069640	craziest thing out of people or you can be or you can become an apathetic and be sexy but stupid
4069640	4072920	and they're in a permanent kind of new year's eve party where they're wearing tuxes like
4073560	4079960	read as the oscars um they're all just like popping champagne and kind of stumbling around
4079960	4083880	with their prosthetic makeup but they they show it's it's pretty funny that they uh because they
4083880	4086680	have a little thing they have a ring where they can make a little computer and it's a lot like
4086680	4090520	siri it's a lot like an iphone or they're like hey uh what's this it's a flower for what for
4090520	4095240	decoration oh thank you siri that's nice and uh and you can and you can put like you can you
4095240	4099320	know put a little screen up on the wall like a projector that's pretty groovy but then they're
4099320	4102760	trying to prove that they can get this guy hard so all these ladies are standing around in their in
4102760	4109160	their past a whole row sean connery sean connery standing out in a red diaper diaper short shorts
4109160	4114920	like so like american apparel like ladies short shorts and he's got his balding man ponytail he's
4115000	4120440	got a ponytail with a slight slight slight receding hairline uh handlebar mustache
4120440	4127160	and and knee-high uh like captain cook boots on how have i missed this movie i don't know it's a
4127160	4131800	mistake it's so good it's yeah it's nuts but then so then they start showing them porn like

4136280	4140520	around like oh i've never seen that before and the first in this show is just of tits yes soapy titties
4140520	4145560	so we're just like soaping upper titties like in a big like tight frame like it's it it works as
4145560	4154440	modern porn yeah no it was hot like like the soapy titties was trans like and then everybody
4154440	4158040	because at first i wanted to mock it i was like soapy titty like that and then i was like jesus
4159720	4164760	i i i felt a little tangled i felt a little because i always thought i was assumed that
4165240	4170840	a woman like soap like like rubbing her boobs with soapy water was like that that was just like
4170840	4175880	the same thing as a woman laying on the hood of a Ferrari it was just like a needless like stylistic
4175880	4179720	thing it's like necessary and awesome at the at the end of at the end of the day a naked
4179720	4184040	lady's a naked lady like like like kind of like who cares like like the idea that high heels or
4184040	4188840	so no the activity of wow okay soap so yeah but wait but he looks at that one nothing happens
4188840	4192600	when he kind of shakes it off like Fernando Valenzuela like that that pitch isn't good
4192600	4197160	and then they show another one of just two women right in mud and that was notably less sexy yeah
4197160	4201640	that one and then you notice that that uh sean connor is just staring at the woman who's kind
4201640	4206280	of been the the negative nelly about like she hates him she's not in the mud face no no she's
4206280	4210040	she's she's putting on the press she's the curator and then everyone's eyes kind of cast
4210040	4213640	down and he's standing there completely stone face just looking at the woman and clearly has
4213640	4220600	got a boner you well you hear you hear the boner computer going boom boom boom boom
4220600	4226600	how have i not seen this movie none of none of your descriptions and you've been describing it
4226600	4231960	collectively for about 20 minutes maybe oh god i hope no single minute of that makes it sound
4231960	4237000	like anything less than the best movie ever made chris mckenna one of dan's writers and community
4237000	4243480	and lovely fellow put disease and zardoz last night he was snoring all the way well it is it's
4243480	4249400	like a fishing lure like the head of it is the impact and then it just tapers off into this
4249400	4254680	like lullaby i can't believe there hasn't been a t-shirt with a stone face guy with glowing eyes
4254680	4262120	that says the penis is evil i bet there is i'm certain there is uh yeah it's it's it's i it's it's
4262120	4268600	it's it's 106 minutes uh it's definitely worth watching the world where is him in the immortal
4268600	4274200	people world most of it yeah he he the movie basically starts with him penetrating that veil
4274200	4280920	yeah and and and and and as the movie continues it reveals more truths than a shamalayan in kind of
4280920	4285960	way that really only served a disappoint because actually the story i was invested in was a savage
4285960	4290840	kind of naively bounding into this world and interacting with the immortals but uh it turns
4290840	4297080	out it was all a big thing uh and it kind of it gets increasingly transcendental and increasingly
4297080	4302440	70s what's uh what's the big we can say spoiler alert and then tell me what the big is that okay
4302440	4306760	if we tell it's zardoz you haven't seen it in 40 years i'm telling you it's too much it's too
4306760	4310680	much a component of the enjoyment of the movie okay for people who haven't seen the movie the
4310680	4318360	spoiler the the big spoiler which actually means not it yeah it's not important to the plot of you
4318360	4323480	can say it's a delicious ridiculous spoiler no i'm not going to say it let them enjoy watch the
4323480	4328840	fucking movie it's the one reward for watching that thing all right all right enough all right
4328920	4334680	spencer how you been man yeah you know zardoz i thought that uh that whole reveal was kind of
4334680	4340440	you know it was worth it but really was i invested i mean there was the renegades and there was the
4340440	4346040	apathetics but at the end of the day i mean it really peaked with the whole penis i didn't watch
4346040	4353560	it um you've never seen it did that sound you've never seen it yeah no not at all you motherfucker
4353560	4360200	yeah i was gonna go i got yeah i had a i had a work meeting um that night i was gonna go
4360200	4365480	you know head over you never have to have an excuse to have not watched zardoz i would have
4365480	4373640	enjoyed seeing it it's good yeah it slows all the way down though it has that hit that 70s
4373640	4378120	patience like rollerball starts off like the best movie you've ever seen james connes in a roller
4378120	4382120	derby competition with the big metal ball and there were no spikes on and it's been heard like
4382120	4386360	what the fuck this is the best and then there's like 45 minutes of people at a cocktail party
4386360	4391800	but light a tree on fire up trees yeah it's so stupid yeah well that's the 70s for you it was
4391800	4397400	like on one hand you didn't it was like harvey town you have no idea you have no no guarantees
4397400	4402360	like you don't you don't know like like like robin william shows up i dropped my pants i confessed
4402360	4408920	to uh bisexuality playing with matches who knows you might you might that's the same zardoz guy
4408920	4414760	bisexual pyromaniac uh look the the attack is on the other hand it could just be a boring show
4414760	4418600	that's just everything all the chairs are from tyler he's just i don't know what you're talking
4418600	4424520	about he's jamming on e nicotine right now he's been smoking this 18 milligram dude i'm
4424520	4429400	going to give you a throat hit in a second man but if you read if you read that uh easy writers
4429400	4433800	raging bulls story it's the story of that that that sin escape changing but you were saying
4433800	4439480	partly joking that that as soon as they blew up the shark and jaws that is the point when movies
4439480	4445320	became i mean we were all born into certainly these people even me were born into a world that
4445320	4452600	had been pre-jawsed like like we don't we movies are part of our government it's the fifth estate
4452600	4456840	you know it's it's it's it's it is it is our religion we go to these temples and we study
4456840	4461880	these things and and they are there's a prerequisite for these things that they have to have a third
4461880	4467720	act um uh the death star is gonna blow up the sharks gotta blow up the the the people gotta go
4467720	4473640	home feeling like there's a purpose in their life um and and but there was a point before that when
4473640	4477880	you know it was like hey it's just a movie whatever it's just another way to make money you
4477880	4482440	could buy a sticks album or you might go to see this thing it's got gene hackman in it he eats
4482440	4488040	some chocolate he jerks off in a cup and then he shoots himself that sounds like a third act
4488040	4495640	yeah the chocolate and the suicide that's the french connection right uh i'll recommend i'll
4495640	4499560	never tell i'll recommend one movie from the 70s that's really really awesome that a lot of people

4911240	4919640	okay last time on harmon time our heroes were on their way towards the thicket of ebb and pillars
4919640	4925480	but soon they lost their bearings assuming they had possessed them in the first place bewildered
4925480	4930520	and surrounded by pillars quark primed the phallic columns and spied with his low light vision a blob
4930520	4936680	of color on the tip of a far-off pillar about that time strange squishing sounds began to surround
4936680	4941800	the heroes with an air of urgency the heroes headed towards the far-off column as the heroes
4941800	4947000	approached the sought-after pillar the squishing continued the colored shape called out it was a
4947000	4952520	person sharpie casting levitate began to approach the old man and quark climbed up his pillar to
4952520	4958440	regard the white clothed old man mole rain and sharp and chris took some turns sending correspondence
4958440	4962680	to the pillar dwelling herman and quark and sharpie also had some words before the whole
4962680	4967640	ensemble moved back down to the ground level the old man named brephy as it happened warned the
4967640	4972440	heroes that they were under assault from a gaggle of deadly phantom funguses which were funguses and
4972440	4978520	definitely not fungi in this specific instance the gang slew the monsters with a far sword blast
4978520	4983160	and a fireball spell which quickly ignited the ebb and pillars running quickly they tore through
4983160	4993640	the forest and came upon a web-slung mass in the ebb and thicket spencer spencer i gotta say man
4993640	4998280	you're in the zone tonight you came up in the zone yeah yeah i feel like you uh you came loaded
4998280	5004600	for bear i feel like if you're like to do baseball or something i only went at bat twice so you know
5004600	5011480	hitting two two you know balls is easy i guess this would be the third yeah this one's more of
5011480	5018520	a base hit yeah so i mean that's still that's really good stats you know there's an alternate
5018520	5023400	world where dnd is like the biggest sport and you're the president of that world because you're
5023400	5031400	fucking amazing at it i mean why is it why is it two i didn't get this why is it two times at that
5031400	5036760	i don't understand oh because when i first came up i had the comment about your um you know i was i
5036760	5040680	was narrating that i think that went over well he's two for two he's saying and baseball you
5040920	5045400	if you hit if you hit three out of ten you're in the hall of fame oh i see yeah yeah okay yeah
5045400	5049640	but i mean it's easier it's easy to say i'm doing good if i said two things and both of them went
5049640	5054280	decently well speaking of doing good i would like to share a triumph you're doing great of my own
5054280	5060760	thank you um i recently bought a new macbook pro and uh and it's uh hardware is sophisticated
5060760	5066520	enough to run a minecraft with all of the mods that i uh have had my eye on uh god that's great
5066520	5073880	news yeah this is already the opposite of the boston bomb story well i didn't you know
5074760	5082120	it was not my fault that that happened today um we don't know that i crazy white guy
5086680	5092600	uh this is getting less benign and more deviant there's a lot of it's called it's called the tech
5092600	5099640	world uh mod pack in minecraft and uh it uh it includes a lot of generators and electronic
5099640	5103720	things and minecraft is a game of like mining things and you mine ore and then you smelt it
5103720	5111560	into other things and you use those tools to mine war or i in tech world i created an automatic miner
5112680	5118200	so i when i play minecraft now i just i have a little box that plays minecraft for me
5119160	5123960	and it mines for me and i just like sucks up the ore and i just collect it so you're
5123960	5129000	just crafting yeah it's just craft the glee on your face is so awesome well because i think
5129000	5134040	that's so funny i saw a guy walking on the street today and he had a shirt that said i love minecraft
5134040	5141560	and i wept openly for humanity yes no no no no that's a game i could never get into it i've
5141560	5145560	watched you play it's fun to watch you play because it's fun watching it's only it's unlike
5145560	5149480	any other thing because i mean like you're talking about games like oblivion the elder
5149480	5153720	scrolls games that we characterize those is like oh shit that's the heroine of video games i played
5153720	5159880	that for 100 hours 200 hours you know whatever like i've been playing minecraft for three four
5159880	5165560	years because they keep coming out with updates it's it's beyond sandbox into just it's it's a
5165560	5172760	combination of knitting smoking and jerking off like it's just a thing you can do at an airport
5172760	5177560	you can do it while you're you can't jerk off at an airport you can knit at an airport i'm just
5177560	5184520	saying there's different tentacles you can jerk off in an airport but you can't smoke spencer
5184520	5188920	yeah oh yeah you don't have to jerk off at an airport it's easier to jerk off but it doesn't
5188920	5195160	hurt you can do both not at the same time that's absurd they can tell you're jerking off and they
5195160	5200360	can see your feet under the stall like shaking like gyrating yeah if you see them gyrating
5200360	5206120	they're going who fucking they're going to hawaii or something they they're nervous that the
5206120	5210840	tropical climate still don't want to see a guy jerking off on the way to the least of my worries
5210840	5217240	while i'm jerking off in an airport the weirdest thing i ever saw in la x i walked right where the
5217240	5221880	baggage carousels are there's a bathroom right there i walked in the bathroom door this is like
5221880	5232360	98 and i and and there was a bathroom stall wide open and there was a guy uh facing away bent over
5232920	5240840	pants around his ankles ass cheeks like like like asshole pointed at anyone that walked in the door
5242200	5249400	stalled or wide open but with a little like toilet paper like in a little halloween ghost shape like
5249400	5255560	like like kind of like dabbing at his asshole like he was like wiping his ass but wanted america
5255560	5265480	to know and you said to him captain that's right i didn't say anything but i stared for him i was
5265480	5273160	like what i was like a deer in headlights and i'll never know what the guy where's he from where is
5273160	5280360	that a thing it was opposite day so he was wiping his ass at america he was making a statement
5280360	5284760	it was opposite day yeah maybe he was like this is what i do in bangladesh i don't know maybe it's
5284760	5291800	like you know it's was he did he have a brown ass not i will tell you this tell me this little i i
5291800	5299480	really hope it's a crazy white guy they can't all be crazy white guys and again i'll tell you please
5299480	5306280	for the second time tonight respect my candor reward me for it because i could i could pretend
5306280	5311400	that this isn't in my head i got it i seem to recall that he was an olive skinned gentleman
5311400	5320760	hey good job on that candor so you saw a brown butch wiping its ass at america i i i i all i
5320760	5327960	i saw maybe there was like a dry run of 9-11 i saw the stakes were much lower i saw an asshole i
5327960	5332440	saw the weirdest thing in the in my life he was dabbing it delicately with a little with
5332440	5335960	a little it was it was i wish i could maybe he was doing the old like come here come hither
5335960	5341000	like the dropped handkerchief bits you know he was like it was simultaneously what you're
5341000	5348200	gonna get it was simultaneously the most private act but performed so publicly like almost like
5348200	5354440	you would think like oh he's he wants me to see this but he this is not paying attention to me
5354440	5358520	stephanie uh how you doing up there you having fun just great yeah there's a re i think we can
5358520	5364520	come up with a reason why he was doing that what if if i'm there and i'm using my phone and i'm on
5364520	5369560	the toilet just trying to find out if it's under with zeus it's a little bit your human desire to
5369560	5375560	make sense exactly we're finding zeus here i'm texting as soon as i'm done i drop my phone in
5375560	5381000	the toilet and so i get up and i'm looking for in the toilet and then i'm like oh shit my ass
5381000	5387480	is still unwiped so i'm like i'll do both so i get the toilet paper and i'm wiping my ass right
5387480	5392440	while i'm looking in the toilet bowl for the phone i drop that's definitely it that's definitely it
5392440	5400600	that's what dr bungler desha's up to yeah the open door is another mystery why there are four
5400600	5407400	phones in 98 it was pre 9 11 that's for sure i don't know why that's significant oh dude that's
5407400	5418440	a total 9 10 story this is like mr show era all right spencer what are we looking at i measured
5418440	5426120	time what season of mr show was on there were only four years before 9 11 until hbo canceled
5426120	5433400	existence so spencer we uh did we defeat the funguses yeah you killed him um yeah i mean we
5433400	5438040	could keep like talking i if we keep going like 20 more minutes i won't have to write anything next
5438040	5444760	week no we're at we're at the we're at the we're about to go into phase spider so do you guys
5444760	5451800	remember you you had sliced one in half and and uh sharpie had cast a fireball that blew up the
5451800	5458200	other one and it lit the the the pillars on fire yeah and then we ran to a phase spider thing
5458280	5464600	spencer i cast fireball on the spider area let's just i'm fucking charging in do it this this
5464600	5470040	national tragedy has filled me with like fuck it no regrets we're fighting all right yeah we're
5470040	5474120	we're still fighting phase fire ball well you aren't fighting anything there's no no i don't
5474120	5478040	care i'm fighting i'm fighting the unknown i'm not yeah i was talking to jack i'm gonna panic
5478040	5483320	yeah definitely this is a preemptive strike casting fireball on i don't know crazy white guy
5483720	5492520	on the massy web of webs the the webby massive webs the webby massive mass why is there a dollar
5492520	5499000	the federal reserve needs to make hand crank radios i feel like more than ever today we
5499000	5505000	should try and reason with the spider rather than trying to just set a bomb no they teach at
5505000	5515080	universities dies okay so sharpie casts fireball on uh what i'm assuming is like the center of like
5515080	5521800	the webby mass or something yeah yeah yeah yeah so it hits it strikes one of the nets and immediately
5521800	5527880	bursts into flames now if you recall fire is slightly less effective on the shadow plane
5527880	5532200	however we don't remember being told yeah no one remembers anything that happens
5535320	5541320	but uh yeah no but there yeah i was someone pulled out a torch and it didn't light very well
5541320	5548840	right it's like uh it's like langoliers sure it's like zardoz you didn't see zardoz i know
5549480	5555800	i didn't see land do lakes either lang langoliers fucking rocks dude yeah you should watch langoliers
5555800	5561000	Spencer watch out nine hours of it valki from perfect strangers isn't it i promise there's
5561000	5569080	a payoff now it's Spencer is the webby mass being tied at any major points are there are
5569080	5574040	there major points of tethering well it's more being consumed by flames oh it's right now it's
5574040	5579000	yeah yeah it's on fire right now yeah and it's burning okay so that's that's probably good right
5579560	5587560	jar job is done to me wow as the webs start to burn away you can hear hisses uh deep within the
5588040	5593800	webby mass and at the same time you see breffi kind of fall to his knees like he's been hurt or
5593800	5603240	something uh-oh what are you like a spider baby he's like i'm breffi oh yeah i'm breffi
5608920	5612040	begins transforming fuck you
5612040	5620280	i told you not to throw the fire we spent two episodes counting treasure i just wanted to move
5620280	5625160	ahead look what's happening to breffi he was just a way he was just a nice home wanderer
5626280	5631480	listen to the last episode he just all he did was oh my god this is like you hauling fire and then
5631480	5641480	they have to go to the madrasas to fight us back go ahead too lofty um um you see uh points raise
5641480	5646840	up out of his shoulder blades as they elongate and stretch and then they pierce out of his back
5646840	5655160	forming spider-like legs um they elongate and he grows and grows in size onto his newly formed
5655160	5662040	legs and is transformed into a hybrid humanoid spider form with clacking mandibles and sharp
5662040	5667720	claws and he's like way to go butt head maybe it's maybe it's not too late to make a friendship with
5667720	5677320	the spider people hey uh have you heard lady in red do you like that song he he makes some sort
5677320	5683880	of utterance but it's no longer english it's more of like a hissing clacking sort of if it's or do i
5683880	5690760	got a shot at it all right i'm gonna be the first to admit i made a mistake no you weren't first we
5690760	5700680	said it before you said it yes you're the first to agree no i said it you agree okay if anything
5700680	5708040	you're third to this party all right so i'll still be friendly i'm going to assume that this
5708040	5715560	uh breffi now means us some harm i don't want to play the blame game because he'll lose yeah you
5715560	5724600	want to play the you want to play the flame games i try and reason with breffi you have a
5724600	5732440	minus six against righteous indignation right now so what's your reason attempt hey breffi uh sorry

5773000	5778040	whose mother the spiders yeah uh you don't know what she looks like would you like to approximate
5778040	5787400	it sure no this sounds like a bad yeah no no oh god it's gonna be worse than the fireball
5788760	5794040	you sort of look like uh the the human form of breffi but with like long hair and like like
5794040	5800680	womanly traits because the hat of disguise can't you know it can't replicate monsters it can only
5800680	5804520	do humanoid shapes this this guy looks like somebody had a good relationship with his parents
5805720	5813720	yeah you know you know arachnids the home is where the heart is so uh sharpie still has his
5813720	5820840	mage armor spell active from the last session so uh you managed to shrug off his blow he rears back
5820840	5827240	with one of his spindly spider-like legs and stabs you directly in the chest however the force armor
5827240	5834120	guarding your body shrugs it off and it glances off your body i go like this like i'm cocky about
5834120	5838920	do you brush it off your shoulders like kobe did before his injury i don't know i don't know what
5838920	5849960	that means but yes i do what kobe did you break you rip your achilles tendon right is that what
5849960	5853160	happened yeah and you cheat on your wife
5856600	5857480	infidelity
5861000	5866600	it's a long fly it's out of here spencer another home are you gonna roll on the infidelity or
5868520	5870840	oh yeah yeah see if there's gonna be charges

5892280	5898280	trying to befriend him now yes or we're gonna try at this point he has attacked that's just what i
5898280	5906360	try okay throw an attack moraine all right uh i would like to shoot two arrows
5913560	5914920	no new taxes
5919720	5920600	i shoot two arrows
5920600	5928840	it's a two arrows remember everybody for the next 25 minutes after she shoots two arrows
5928840	5936760	her baby back ribs are half off it's the two arrows discounts two arrows
5938360	5944760	one of the arrows strikes true and hits him directly in the shoulder the other flies astray
5944760	5949800	did you say it strikes truant true true into his shoulder it doesn't go to class
5951560	5959880	the arrow strikes truant it goes to a fishing hole yeah like tom sawyer it blows up class
5959880	5967640	avoids the constable all right um it befriends her oh did i say how much damage that did
5967640	5974520	four damage sorry everybody now not much spiders have lots of eyes right spiders they got some
5974520	5978360	eyes with my dazzling lights uh dazzle a spider would that be extra effective on the on the
5978360	5983320	multiple eyes the dazzling lights dancing lights dancing no sees yeah no the dancing
5983320	5989080	lights would not oh dancing lights just like kind of just for mood it's like do you want to
5989080	5995000	fuck the spider i haven't ruled it out yeah it's it's like illusions you know it's like
5995000	6000360	you're like oh i want to make it look like a smiley face is illusion i don't know it's hard
6000360	6006600	to explain all right um i take uh i take some uh of moraine's uh i'm gonna i'm gonna do a combo
6006600	6013720	move here with the rope tracker i'm gonna tie my i'm gonna tie my far sword or no i can't do that
6013720	6018360	yeah your far sword is a technique yeah technique you know okay forget the rope thing i'm going to
6018360	6023800	take my far sword and swipe it underneath it try to chop off its legs okay so you can swipe at
6023800	6028920	you don't have cleave uh yeah you'll you'll swipe at the legs the you know the point being to try
6028920	6034040	and like cripple them yeah i want to immobilize this motherfucker all right in a mobilizing strike
6037240	6043480	oh shit that's a critical hit fuck yeah does that mean does that mean you rolled 20
6044040	6049320	yeah i rolled a 20 he rolled a 20 critical hit talking chopped off all of his legs nope no oh
6050920	6055960	don't get ahead of yourself you do chop off three of his legs three of eight three of his
6055960	6061560	legs are cleft straight off of his body and fall to the floor if i'd attacked his head and i got a
6061560	6065160	critical hit would that have been that have been it for this moment i mean it still does the same
6065160	6072680	amount of damage which is it wouldn't have died i got you seven twelve twenty four okay so you did
6072680	6078920	24 damage i'm with you okay cool wow so we got a hobbled spider oh yeah i'm assuming as i aimed at
6078920	6083160	one side that we chopped off like the left side or what would you let so let's just say you chopped
6083160	6087800	off his left three legs so now he can only walk in ever decreasing circles in one direction
6088760	6093960	or i mean you can hop around on like four feet or something okay i don't know who knows man

6334040	6341080	combat oh all right well then i i weirdly i take my cloak and i try and bandage one of his legs
6341640	6345800	you guys might have healing potions if you're down to heal him i healed the spider

6504520	6509000	she's the wrong person dude why don't you just steal some money from the spider
6511240	6517480	and then we'll be okay all right let's just kill him what are merciful arrows merciful arrows
6517480	6523080	deal extra damage but they only deal non-lethal damage so again if you're trying to knock people
6523080	6528440	out you can you can stab them full of merciful arrows no problem but uh yeah they won't die
6528440	6532120	i have a bedroll i'd like to uh wrap it around the spider's head

6652680	6656120	and i go up to the spider and i slowly pull the bedroll back off its head
