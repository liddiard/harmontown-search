132000	134000	Just kidding
134000	136000	I'll probably shoot myself
137000	139000	Or just so many drugs
142000	144000	I didn't want to rhyme it with shelf
145000	147000	But what's she gonna do
148000	150000	Yo, I got problems in work
151000	154000	I got problems in the middle
154000	156000	In the top of my dick
157000	160000	I got problems in all of them face
160000	163000	I got problems, I got lonely sad
164000	166000	Drug-addled problems
167000	169000	I don't believe in God no more
169000	171000	But if I did, I'd fuck him so hard
171000	173000	And go out the door
173000	175000	I'd fuck the devil too
175000	177000	I'll go rule in hell and say
177000	178000	How about you?
178000	180000	I'm gonna fuck the devil hard
180000	182000	Cause I'm so sad and lonely
182000	184000	I'm a hip hop sad
184000	186000	Modern hip hop lonely man
187000	189000	And I, I got my
190000	192000	I got my auto-tune to pay
192000	195000	If I could afford to be in a studio
196000	197000	Why?
197000	199000	Why is it a scam?
200000	202000	I didn't share near this
202000	204000	I don't want to sound old
204000	206000	But I didn't share near this
206000	208000	Why is everyone doing it?
208000	210000	It seems like the 80s
214000	217000	There's some cool things about the 80s
219000	220000	I don't want to shit on them
221000	223000	Cause the dropper brothers are here
223000	225000	And I think they like the 80s
226000	228000	I think they kinda like the 80s
229000	231000	But I don't like the ladies
232000	233000	Because they're just like a drug
233000	235000	The cops are firing my soul
235000	237000	I hang myself with my flow
238000	241000	My neck is broken and my soul is empty
241000	244000	I'm a modern hip hop guy, I'm sad
244000	246000	It's all no hip hop
246000	248000	But it's not any less violent
248000	250000	Who could have predicted this phenomenon?
250000	253000	It's weird and kind of admirable
253000	255000	But fuck you mom, it's so hard
255000	257000	She turned into a bull
257000	259000	It was ancient Greek in that regard
259000	262000	I'm gonna go across the river Styx
262000	265000	And cut myself with a shard of myself
272000	273000	I'm trying to
273000	275000	I don't want to be like one of those guys
275000	277000	That's like, oh I'm rapping
277000	279000	And then it's like
279000	281000	My name is something that I'm here to say
281000	283000	And then you're like, come on
283000	284000	The rap doesn't sound like that anymore
284000	286000	So I listen to more rap
286000	289000	And I was like, geez, these guys are so
289000	290000	They're so sad
290000	291000	Oh yeah
292000	293000	It's really
293000	294000	You really couldn't have predicted it
294000	295000	Cause it was sort of
295000	296000	Oh, oh, oh, is it
296000	297000	I'm still
297000	299000	They're so sad
303000	304000	Okay, so there's
304000	307000	There's the knob that's supposed to change key
307000	309000	I guess I wish I knew more about music
310000	311000	I don't think that one works
311000	312000	I think we need to send that back
312000	314000	But then there's a knob that says
314000	315000	Ginger
317000	319000	And it has two settings
325000	328000	Which we now know it shouldn't
328000	330000	It should be a continuum
331000	333000	But it's two settings or this
333000	335000	Which is 1999
336000	338000	Prince, the prince definition
340000	341000	And then this
341000	344000	Which is just, you know, the elephant
345000	347000	That's the parliament funkadelic voice
347000	348000	Yeah
348000	350000	We're going to a planet of music
350000	352000	Say, say atomic dog
352000	354000	I hope you bring some pussy
355000	356000	It ain't about that
356000	357000	It's about music
358000	359000	What are you, gay?
361000	362000	No, I'm a human being
362000	363000	Sounds gay
365000	366000	Then maybe all humans are gay
366000	368000	Maybe we like to fuck music
369000	371000	You can do it somewhere else
373000	374000	Cause I'm straight
375000	377000	Because it's 1983
377000	380000	And I'm not allowed to be gay
384000	386000	Resulting in quite a lot of
386000	389000	Fantastical costumes and hairstyles
390000	393000	Because when you put your thumb over a hose
393000	395000	It sprays everywhere
399000	401000	You're like, yeah
401000	403000	You're like the new Reggie Watts
403000	404000	What's that?
404000	406000	You're like the new Reggie Watts, I think
406000	408000	This is the new show
408000	409000	What does Reggie Watts do?
409000	411000	He's got a delay pedal, he's great
411000	412000	Oh no!
412000	414000	I was not the first person to think of
414000	415000	Using it comedically
415000	416000	Oh no
416000	417000	Oh, honey
418000	420000	Oh no
420000	422000	Well, alright, I'll pull the rip card
422000	424000	I have some ventriloquist dummies in the back
424000	427000	I've got one that's a terrorist
427000	428000	Oh, they're not
428000	430000	But he's not too bright
430000	431000	He blows himself up
431000	433000	I make fun of him
434000	438000	So I hear we have one guest here
438000	442000	Who wasn't here when we started the show
442000	443000	Oh, okay
443000	444000	Well, alright
444000	445000	Well, it's 9-11
445000	446000	So let's bring out Andy Dick
447000	448000	I don't think it's him
448000	449000	I think it's just Dino
450000	451000	Alright, well it's 9-11
451000	452000	So let's bring out Dino
461000	462000	Happy 9-11
465000	466000	Yeah, in remembrance
466000	467000	We're not going to point out
467000	470000	When it becomes 9-11 tonight, I think
470000	472000	Tonight it's all one big remembrance
472000	473000	Yeah
473000	475000	Did you see the clip that was circulating?
475000	476000	The guy on the Stairmaster?
476000	477000	No
478000	480000	There was a fireman wearing all his gear
480000	482000	And did like 157 steps
482000	484000	Or whatever they did on the Stairmaster
485000	486000	I know
486000	487000	It's sad
487000	489000	I love misguided sincerity
489000	490000	I love that
491000	492000	I love that guy
492000	494000	I hope he was crying
495000	497000	Not because I want to make fun of him
497000	499000	He was sad
500000	501000	I love that
501000	502000	I like that
503000	506000	There was a clip that was circulating from around 9-11
506000	510000	When it was like as the footage of the towers are falling
510000	511000	And Donald Trump is the
511000	515000	Who then is only a pizza spokesman in reality shows
516000	518000	He's just talking about
518000	520000	And he knows 9-11 is happening
520000	522000	And he knows fully well
522000	525000	He's in a labyrinth of things to say wrong
525000	527000	And he comes up with
527000	528000	He's just like
528000	533000	By the way, I'm over at a 60 Trump boulevard or whatever
533000	538000	Which was the tallest building before the World Trade Center
538000	540000	And then for a while it was the second tallest
540000	542000	But now it's the tallest again
543000	545000	I didn't watch the actual clip
545000	547000	But that's the description of what's happening
547000	548000	He's just like
548000	549000	Why not?
549000	550000	What can happen?
550000	553000	I'm famous for my honesty and my charm
553000	557000	Why don't I just go right through those saloon doors
557000	563000	And just whip it around like a little carousel
563000	565000	It's so hacky that his name is Trump
565000	567000	That's all he cares about
567000	569000	Yeah, he cares about Trump
571000	573000	I'm saying God's hacky, not me
575000	578000	Did you see my Reggie Watts clip?
578000	580000	I just got out of band practice
580000	581000	I could use that for my voice
581000	583000	Because I'm not a good singer
583000	586000	I'm starting a band, you know that
586000	588000	I'm just telling the world
588000	589000	You've started a band
589000	593000	So you're here because Feral Audio now has a show with you and Andy on it
593000	594000	That's right, yeah
594000	595000	Scull juice
595000	596000	Scull juice
596000	597000	Yeah, yeah
600000	601000	Yeah, it's just like
601000	606000	I kind of just do it because Andy needs someone to talk to every now and then
606000	608000	Like everyone's cut him out of his life
610000	611000	Yeah, and he's like
611000	613000	Well, you guys just did this thing where you went
613000	614000	That's
614000	621000	Yeah, we just went to New York and we read an old script that I wrote with Scott Atson, Stephen Colbert
621000	624000	And Mike Stoyanoff of TV's Blossom fame
624000	628000	He played the older brother, Anthony, the ex-drug addict
628000	629000	Tony Blossom?
629000	633000	Yeah, the only person less famous was me there upon this
633000	635000	Louis was on, yeah
635000	638000	We wrote Louis into the script and
638000	639000	Yeah, we went to New York
639000	642000	You guys did a reading of the script that you had written in the old days
642000	644000	Kind of like before 30 Rock it was like a
644000	648000	It was like a script you had written that was like behind the scenes at SNL type shows
648000	649000	Yeah, that's right, yeah
649000	651000	Barry Levinson hired me to write it
651000	655000	He wanted it to be like behind the scenes of an Ed Sullivan show
655000	657000	With like jugglers and monkeys and stuff
657000	660000	And I'm like, I have no fucking clue what that means
660000	662000	And I said, what about SNL?
662000	663000	He's like, that's a dumb idea
663000	665000	And we argued the whole time
665000	666000	But so this
666000	668000	This was kind of like a hybrid
668000	670000	But yeah, so then we went and read it
670000	673000	And Smigel was part of it, Robert Smigel
673000	675000	And yeah, it was fun
675000	677000	Everyone had a good time except for Andy
677000	678000	Is Andy here yet?
678000	679000	Yeah
679000	680000	So I could talk behind his back
680000	682000	He was so depressed afterwards
682000	684000	He's like, why was I even there?
684000	686000	It was all about you and your friends
686000	688000	And how you keep in touch with people
688000	689000	Yeah
689000	690000	He's such a
690000	691000	Like I always
691000	693000	He was on Great Minds, the History Channel thing
693000	694000	And it was like, he's
694000	696000	He's amazing
696000	697000	He'll be here any second
698000	701000	He's very funny and wonderful
701000	702000	He's great, yeah
702000	703000	When he's like
703000	704000	When he's
704000	705000	Somebody said he's right here
705000	706000	What is it?
708000	709000	Just bring him in
710000	711000	There he is
711000	712000	Yeah
713000	715000	Thank God you walked in when I said you were great
717000	718000	You didn't hear that?
718000	719000	No, I didn't
719000	721000	I said, yeah, he's great
723000	724000	I like that
724000	725000	Alright, yeah
725000	727000	Yeah, I mean, he's putting it in Vibrate
727000	729000	Happy 9-11, buddy
729000	730000	No, no, I'm putting it in
730000	733000	I'm Snapchatting these lovely people
733000	734000	Look at them
734000	735000	I love them
736000	737000	Hi, everybody, say
737000	738000	Hi
739000	740000	Look at
741000	743000	Oh, grumpy cats
744000	745000	Grumpy cats
749000	750000	I think we're about to talk about
750000	753000	Well, what I would like to talk about with Andy
754000	757000	I mean, it's easy enough to go like, oh, Andy
757000	758000	Andy's amazing
758000	759000	Like, I think
760000	762000	There's a little phase of your career where it's like
762000	764000	You know, like the clown prince
764000	766000	Or like, you know, people are going like, oh, Andy Dick
766000	769000	And then you, like, there's an unspoken like
769000	771000	Like, you know
771000	772000	Oh, him
772000	773000	Yeah, cautionary
773000	774000	You know, it's like
774000	776000	You were, I always looked at you as like pan
776000	777000	Like, from Greek mythology
777000	778000	Like, you were a pan
778000	780000	Like, where we get the word panic
780000	781000	Sexy
782000	784000	Like, half goat and he's got a flute
784000	786000	And he, like, comes down the mountain
786000	788000	And causes fucking hysteria and craziness
788000	790000	And, like, for the sake of it
790000	794000	And then either disappears or gets beat up by Wesley Snipes in the bathroom
795000	797000	Did you have an encounter with Wesley Snipes?
797000	798000	Okay
801000	803000	All right, so, but
803000	805000	Can I tell you what happened with that?
805000	807000	But I think I know
807000	808000	Well, I dropped the end bomb
808000	809000	Right
809000	810000	It was, you know
810000	811000	Well, that's bad, Andy
814000	815000	That's a no-no
818000	819000	We have a whole podcast
819000	820000	Our whole podcast that just went up
820000	822000	Sorry, I don't want to derail
822000	825000	But it's about how Andy read an article
825000	828000	About how black people's eyes have been
828000	831000	They've been bred to have their eyes pop out
831000	833000	When they're scared
833000	834000	So what?
834000	835000	What?
835000	836000	Well, that's
838000	839000	Let's move along from that
841000	843000	Was the article in Hustler?
844000	845000	There was no article
845000	846000	It was my philosophy
846000	847000	What?
847000	849000	Oh, you didn't tell me that
852000	854000	You told me you read it somewhere else
854000	856000	I was trying to get away
859000	860000	And then we talked about
860000	863000	There's a whole group of black people that can
863000	866000	They can just go thunk and their eyes pop out
867000	868000	What are you talking about?
868000	869000	Is that your
869000	870000	You say what if there was?
870000	871000	Is that your
871000	872000	No, there is
872000	876000	Yeah, a lot of black people can make
876000	878000	Is there something wrong with it?
878000	879000	And then I just thought
879000	880000	Well, it's a road flare
880000	882000	The phrase black people
882000	885000	It just makes people do what they should
885000	886000	In traffic, which is like
886000	887000	No, it's just
887000	890000	Do their feet also do their duty
890000	891000	When they run?
892000	894000	No, come on, no, I'm serious
894000	896000	And I don't like saying African-American
896000	898000	Because they're not from Africa
898000	899000	Well, it just doesn't
899000	901000	Black, I don't know
901000	902000	I'm white
902000	903000	They say white
903000	905000	I think black people's fine
905000	906000	It's not a magical phrase
906000	908000	That makes people think you're a bad person
908000	909000	I was just saying
909000	910000	It puts everybody
910000	911000	It puts millennials
911000	912000	They cover the break
912000	913000	They go like
913000	916000	Okay, it's bumper to bumper
916000	918000	I'm going to go 35 instead of 45
918000	919000	That's what
922000	924000	Because they've seen shit
924000	926000	They were born into it
927000	928000	It's not like
928000	930000	I think our generation goes like
930000	931000	What are these people
931000	932000	After all this time
932000	933000	What are they so worried about
933000	934000	And complaining about it
934000	936000	It's like they just got here
936000	938000	And all they've seen is fucked up shit
938000	941000	We actually kind of because we were
941000	943000	Because we lived through no internet
943000	945000	And then into internet
945000	948000	Our perception as Gen Xers, whatever we are
948000	950000	Is that
950000	952000	Oh, everything was fine
952000	955000	Until everyone started talking about it
957000	959000	That's the fiber of our being
959000	961000	And then the new generation is typified
961000	962000	By just their relate
962000	963000	They just
963000	964000	They were born
964000	965000	And they're like
965000	967000	Mama, dada, internet
967000	969000	And the internet was like
969000	971000	The cops will shoot you if you're black
971000	972000	And they're like
972000	973000	What's that mean?
973000	974000	And they're like
974000	975000	You know
975000	976000	And then it's like
976000	977000	Fuck you, lived hard
977000	978000	And they're like
978000	979000	What the fuck is happening?
979000	982000	They get a fire hose of information
982000	983000	To the face every day
983000	984000	Yeah
984000	985000	I mean you're just saying
985000	986000	Listen to our podcast
986000	987000	And I think you're right
987000	988000	No, I think it's good
988000	990000	I'm trying to
990000	992000	I'm trying to
992000	994000	I'm trying to think more
994000	995000	I'm trying to think more laterally about it
995000	996000	And just go
996000	998000	These are the things that make us different
998000	999000	For that reason
999000	1001000	We had Karen Kilgarifon last week
1001000	1003000	And she
1003000	1004000	She host a true crime show
1004000	1005000	And we talked about it
1005000	1006000	It's like
1006000	1007000	Well true crime through a certain lens
1007000	1008000	It's like
1008000	1009000	It's totally insensitive
1009000	1010000	And non PC
1010000	1011000	Because you're like having fun
1011000	1012000	Talking about people getting killed
1012000	1013000	And blah blah blah
1013000	1014000	But it's like
1014000	1015000	There's no person out there that's like
1015000	1016000	I'm gonna
1016000	1018000	I'm gonna figure out what's right and what's wrong
1018000	1019000	It's just like
1019000	1020000	When you look at people as a biomass
1020000	1023000	And then they emanate like these weird things
1023000	1024000	I'm sure everybody would be
1024000	1027000	Would love to tune in and listen to you guys
1027000	1029000	Like transgress a million thresholds a minute
1029000	1030000	Yeah
1030000	1031000	Because it's not
1031000	1032000	It doesn't mean that they're bad people
1032000	1033000	For listening and stuff
1033000	1034000	Well I was listening to it
1034000	1035000	And I was getting angry
1035000	1036000	Yeah
1036000	1038000	But I got angry because we
1038000	1039000	We went into a whole
1039000	1040000	Um
1040000	1041000	Tyrate about
1041000	1043000	What's going on?
1044000	1046000	We're scoping now
1046000	1048000	I embrace the whole
1048000	1049000	Right?
1049000	1050000	Is that what that is?
1050000	1051000	It's scoping
1051000	1052000	Periscoping?
1052000	1053000	No
1053000	1054000	No he's snapchat, right?
1054000	1055000	Scoping
1055000	1056000	Although I was big on it for
1056000	1057000	One hot minute
1057000	1058000	On Periscope
1058000	1059000	What are you streaming there then?
1059000	1060000	Uh Facebook
1060000	1061000	Oh that's where it's at
1061000	1062000	I should have asked but
1062000	1063000	Oh yeah no
1063000	1064000	No no no
1064000	1065000	We're streaming
1065000	1066000	No it's not happening anywhere
1066000	1068000	It's happening right here with
1068000	1070000	You know this is all being videoed
1070000	1071000	We're scoping
1071000	1072000	No but I
1072000	1073000	People
1073000	1074000	Wherever
1074000	1075000	Let me tell you something
1075000	1076000	I was periscoping
1076000	1077000	I was periscoping once
1077000	1078000	And people make fun of me
1078000	1079000	For doing that
1079000	1080000	Ha ha
1080000	1081000	Sure
1081000	1082000	Doink
1082000	1083000	My eyes
1083000	1087000	We also went in about like
1087000	1088000	All right
1088000	1089000	Here's what it is
1089000	1090000	Is
1090000	1091000	What my
1091000	1092000	My thought on that
1092000	1095000	I think popping out is
1095000	1096000	That
1096000	1097000	Well the eyes will pop out
1097000	1098000	Like they can go
1098000	1099000	Watch this
1099000	1100000	Watch this
1100000	1101000	Doink
1101000	1102000	And I think that
1102000	1103000	That they were
1103000	1104000	That they were
1104000	1105000	Bread maybe
1105000	1106000	Like they were
1106000	1107000	The one
1107000	1108000	Not that they were
1108000	1109000	Don't worry about them
1109000	1112000	He didn't need to say
1112000	1113000	I think that
1113000	1114000	That back in
1114000	1115000	Oh it's
1115000	1117000	This is just a weird thought I had
1117000	1118000	And that is
1118000	1119000	You know when
1119000	1120000	It's too hard for
1120000	1121000	I love it
1121000	1122000	You know you know
1122000	1123000	The thing yeah
1123000	1124000	When we don't have an audience
1124000	1125000	We can roll around
1125000	1126000	Back in the day
1126000	1127000	Roll around the mud
1127000	1128000	When there was
1128000	1130000	Horrible horrible things going
1130000	1131000	Especially in our country
1131000	1132000	You know when
1132000	1133000	The slavery days
1133000	1134000	Yeah it's just
1134000	1137000	Which is still hard to even
1137000	1138000	Wrap my head around that
1138000	1139000	It was
1139000	1140000	Really in our lifetime
1140000	1141000	And it's really now even still
1141000	1143000	Racial shit is still
1143000	1145000	All right so you're anti-slavery
1145000	1147000	Which should soften the blow
1147000	1148000	Of what you're about to say
1148000	1150000	Which is you believe
1150000	1152000	That a forced breeding program
1152000	1154000	To create a comedic effect
1154000	1156000	I just had the thought
1156000	1157000	You know
1157000	1158000	You're not gonna like it
1158000	1159000	I relate
1159000	1160000	I don't even know why
1160000	1161000	I brought it up
1161000	1162000	I just had the thought that
1162000	1163000	How come I can't
1163000	1164000	Make my eyes pop out
1164000	1165000	And you don't know
1165000	1166000	I don't know any
1166000	1167000	White people that can
1167000	1168000	Make their eyes pop out
1168000	1169000	I think back in the day
1169000	1170000	When they
1170000	1171000	When they were
1171000	1173000	When they were chasing down someone
1173000	1175000	They'd be so afraid
1175000	1176000	Their eyes would pop out
1176000	1177000	And they'd be like
1177000	1178000	Oh then
1178000	1179000	And then they'd be like
1179000	1180000	That one's funny
1180000	1181000	Let's keep that one around
1181000	1186000	And that would be bad
1186000	1188000	It's just a thought
1188000	1190000	So I was listening back to the podcast
1190000	1191000	And I was laughing
1191000	1192000	I thought we were great
1192000	1193000	I read it by the way
1193000	1194000	I read it in Vanity Fair
1194000	1195000	What?
1195000	1196000	Oh you read the thing
1196000	1197000	About the eyes popping out
1197000	1198000	Okay whatever
1198000	1199000	You didn't say that
1199000	1200000	So we started talking
1200000	1201000	And then we went into
1201000	1203000	Because on Community
1203000	1204000	There was a writer saying
1204000	1206000	How a black writer was
1206000	1208000	Was talking about how
1208000	1209000	Black people were afraid
1209000	1210000	To buy watermelon
1210000	1211000	Not afraid
1211000	1213000	But embarrassed to buy watermelon
1213000	1215000	Because of the stigma
1215000	1216000	Of a black guy with watermelon
1217000	1218000	So sometimes they would have
1218000	1220000	White people buy it for them
1220000	1221000	And we're talking about
1221000	1222000	How not fair it is
1222000	1223000	Because watermelon is delicious
1223000	1224000	I know you don't like it
1224000	1225000	But it's great
1225000	1226000	Everyone loves it
1226000	1227000	And then we talked about fried chicken
1227000	1228000	And our favorite fried chicken place
1228000	1229000	And we talked about Popeyes
1229000	1230000	But then we said
1230000	1232000	Like I want me to love that chicken
1232000	1233000	And Popeyes
1233000	1234000	And you're not going to pop out
1234000	1236000	But then we talked about Popeyes
1236000	1237000	And we didn't mention
1237000	1239000	We didn't mention that the name is
1239000	1240000	Popeyes
1240000	1242000	The name of the place is called
1242000	1243000	Popeyes
1243000	1244000	Oh my god
1244000	1245000	Yeah
1246000	1248000	Is that why?
1248000	1250000	Is that why?
1250000	1252000	Is that why?
1252000	1253000	Look
1253000	1256000	I'm caught in the cult of Andy right now
1256000	1257000	No
1257000	1259000	It's just a thought I had
1259000	1261000	Why didn't we put two and two together?
1261000	1262000	I know
1262000	1263000	We didn't mention it's called Popeyes
1263000	1265000	So I gave you that gift on your podcast
1265000	1266000	Thank you
1266000	1267000	Yes
1267000	1268000	There
1268000	1269000	We almost can go home now
1269000	1270000	I know
1270000	1271000	Feels so good
1271000	1272000	Well I want to talk about
1272000	1273000	See
1273000	1274000	I want to talk about an aspect of Andy
1274000	1275000	That I don't know
1275000	1277000	He's not famous for
1277000	1278000	If anything
1278000	1279000	You're famous for
1279000	1280000	You know
1280000	1281000	You people would assume
1281000	1283000	Well you probably thick skinned
1283000	1285000	Because you're such an agent of chaos
1285000	1286000	I can't take it
1286000	1287000	Except you wouldn't know that last night
1287000	1289000	When I went to get a cup of coffee last night
1289000	1290000	At midnight
1290000	1291000	Who does that?
1291000	1292000	But I did
1292000	1294000	And there were these two ladies in front of me
1294000	1296000	I have to tell you this real quick
1296000	1298000	And these two ladies are in front of me
1298000	1299000	And right when I walked in
1299000	1301000	The guy was like
1301000	1303000	Oh no not you
1303000	1304000	Well we know you
1304000	1306000	No no no
1306000	1307000	And I'm like
1307000	1308000	You go crazy on coffee
1308000	1311000	Caffeine drives you mad
1311000	1312000	And I just said
1312000	1313000	Oh yeah
1313000	1314000	Well yeah I see
1314000	1315000	Um
1315000	1316000	But you know
1316000	1317000	Help the ladies
1317000	1318000	And I just want a cup of coffee
1318000	1319000	And then
1319000	1321000	They talked and were talking
1321000	1322000	They were done
1322000	1323000	They were done ordering
1323000	1324000	Done getting their stuff
1324000	1325000	And they just kept talking
1325000	1326000	About some bar they were going to
1326000	1327000	And I was just patiently waiting
1327000	1329000	I just really just want a cup of coffee
1329000	1330000	Um
1330000	1331000	But I didn't say that
1331000	1332000	I was just standing there
1332000	1333000	And then
1333000	1334000	They left
1334000	1335000	And then I said
1335000	1336000	Yeah I just want a cup of coffee
1336000	1337000	Um
1337000	1338000	With cream
1338000	1339000	And then
1339000	1340000	He was talking
1340000	1341000	And
1341000	1342000	And
1342000	1343000	Ignoring me kind of
1343000	1344000	Put the coffee mug over here
1344000	1346000	And he didn't start up the coffee
1346000	1347000	There's a thing
1347000	1348000	It's this one on Cahuenga
1348000	1349000	Where it's a drip thing
1349000	1350000	And you press a button
1350000	1351000	And then I was waiting
1351000	1352000	I think that's every street
1352000	1353000	Coffee works like that
1353000	1354000	And it felt
1354000	1355000	It felt like five minutes
1355000	1356000	And I said
1356000	1358000	So does it just happen?
1358000	1359000	The coffee
1360000	1361000	The mug is in here
1361000	1362000	And he went
1362000	1363000	Oh
1363000	1364000	Oh yeah yeah
1364000	1365000	You wanted coffee
1366000	1367000	At the coffee place
1367000	1368000	And so he took the mug
1368000	1369000	And put it under the thing
1369000	1370000	And then started pressing buttons
1370000	1371000	And I started saying
1371000	1373000	So were you just not
1373000	1375000	Did it make it or
1378000	1379000	And then this guy came in
1379000	1381000	Immediately after
1381000	1382000	And then the guy said
1382000	1383000	Oh
1383000	1384000	Are you
1384000	1386000	Oh are you guys closed or something?
1386000	1387000	And he said
1387000	1388000	Yes
1388000	1390000	And we're just doing illicit deals right now
1390000	1391000	And I went
1391000	1392000	No no no
1393000	1394000	I'm just getting a cup of coffee
1394000	1396000	I'm pretty sure they're open
1396000	1397000	He's getting a cup of coffee
1397000	1398000	And it was just
1398000	1399000	I was getting like
1399000	1400000	We
1400000	1401000	I was
1401000	1402000	This is what happened
1402000	1403000	This has never happened before
1403000	1404000	Because usually I just take it
1404000	1405000	You said thick skin
1405000	1406000	And it's true
1406000	1407000	And I just take it
1407000	1408000	And I take it
1408000	1409000	And I take it
1409000	1410000	And I take it
1410000	1411000	And I snapped last night
1411000	1412000	You guys would have been so proud of me
1413000	1414000	I fucking said no
1414000	1415000	I don't know if you know what pride is
1415000	1417000	No one was scared
1419000	1420000	He laughed
1420000	1421000	And then
1421000	1423000	And then he started remaking my coffee
1423000	1424000	And doing my coffee
1424000	1425000	And I said
1426000	1427000	Something
1427000	1428000	He said one more comment
1428000	1429000	You know
1429000	1430000	Well you know
1430000	1431000	You're that guy
1431000	1432000	This and that
1432000	1433000	And I said
1433000	1434000	I said something to the effect of
1434000	1435000	Well you know
1435000	1436000	Sometimes I'm just a guy
1436000	1437000	That just wants a cup of coffee
1437000	1438000	But thanks
1438000	1439000	I get it
1439000	1441000	Because it's the life I created
1441000	1442000	And you're in good company
1442000	1443000	Because everybody makes fun of me
1443000	1444000	You know
1444000	1445000	Letterman
1445000	1446000	Conan
1446000	1447000	Harmon
1448000	1449000	So I get it
1449000	1450000	And once again
1450000	1451000	I deserve it
1451000	1452000	I deserve it
1452000	1453000	Because I'm an idiot
1453000	1454000	And I am an idiot
1454000	1455000	I'm an idiot
1455000	1456000	You know
1456000	1457000	Actually you know
1457000	1458000	Can I tell you something?
1458000	1459000	Alcoholism and drug addiction
1459000	1460000	It's kind of a serious thing
1460000	1461000	And you know what it is like
1461000	1462000	In a way
1462000	1463000	I mean just to point it out
1463000	1464000	It'd be like if I came in with crutches
1464000	1466000	And I was like a cripple
1466000	1467000	And you said
1467000	1468000	Hey sorry we don't have a rant for you
1468000	1469000	Gimpo the clown
1470000	1471000	It's kind of like that
1471000	1472000	But I'm okay
1472000	1473000	I'm just saying
1473000	1474000	Watch yourself for other people
1474000	1475000	That might not be okay with it
1475000	1476000	But I'm perfectly fine
1477000	1478000	Fine with it
1479000	1480000	But just be careful
1480000	1482000	Because some people might snap
1482000	1483000	He was like
1483000	1484000	No
1484000	1485000	I didn't mean it like that at all
1485000	1486000	And I went
1486000	1487000	Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
1487000	1488000	No
1488000	1489000	You said right when I walked in
1489000	1490000	You went
1490000	1491000	Whoa we know you
1491000	1492000	Not you
1492000	1493000	What does that mean?
1493000	1494000	No I
1494000	1495000	I don't even know that part about you
1495000	1496000	Like what?
1496000	1497000	That I'm a big drug addict
1497000	1498000	An alcoholic
1498000	1499000	He's like
1499000	1500000	That's what I said
1500000	1501000	He said
1501000	1502000	Yeah no
1502000	1503000	I just know
1503000	1504000	You know you're a celebrity
1504000	1505000	And I smell bullshit
1505000	1506000	Oh okay then
1506000	1508000	What's your favorite thing I've heard?
1509000	1511000	He said well I don't know
1511000	1512000	He said I don't know
1512000	1513000	I don't really know what you do
1513000	1514000	I'm like
1514000	1515000	That's my point
1515000	1517000	You know me from being a fucking moron
1517000	1518000	I admit it
1518000	1519000	I admit it
1519000	1520000	And that's what you were doing
1520000	1522000	You were kind of going with the fucking flow
1522000	1523000	And making fun of me in front of those people
1523000	1524000	And then the next guy comes in
1524000	1526000	Oh no we're just doing an illicit deal
1526000	1528000	You're talking about drugs
1528000	1529000	Right?
1529000	1530000	And so you're lying
1530000	1531000	And fuck you
1532000	1533000	Oh my god
1533000	1534000	I am so proud of you
1534000	1535000	I am proud of you
1535000	1536000	I'm very proud of you
1539000	1541000	I normally am not like that
1541000	1543000	I feel responsible
1543000	1545000	No but I do feel proud
1545000	1547000	Because I never stick up for myself like that
1547000	1548000	And I said fuck you
1548000	1551000	But by the end we had made up
1551000	1552000	And I was
1552000	1554000	His dad's an alcoholic
1555000	1557000	And I understood where I was coming from
1557000	1558000	And then I was crying
1558000	1559000	And I'm like now I'm an asshole
1559000	1560000	Wait this continued
1560000	1562000	And he started apologizing
1562000	1563000	And broke down
1564000	1565000	And we both had
1565000	1567000	It was a cathartic thing
1567000	1568000	And I said you know what
1568000	1569000	Can I be honest with you
1569000	1571000	You helped me so much right now
1571000	1573000	That you were just like this opening
1573000	1574000	For me to
1574000	1575000	I guess I carry that with me
1575000	1576000	Everywhere I fucking go
1576000	1578000	And I don't have thick skin I guess
1578000	1580000	And when people make fun of me
1580000	1581000	I'm just getting smaller
1581000	1582000	And smaller
1582000	1583000	And sadder
1583000	1584000	And sadder
1584000	1585000	That's what I was going to talk about
1585000	1586000	Because on one
1586000	1587000	Through one lens
1587000	1588000	You're like
1589000	1591000	You're like this Pokemon that like
1591000	1592000	You
1593000	1594000	You
1595000	1596000	You
1596000	1597000	You have some quirky name
1597000	1598000	And like
1598000	1599000	You curl up into a ball
1599000	1600000	And like
1600000	1601000	Your exploits are like
1601000	1602000	Well
1602000	1605000	It's not like you're a rude
1605000	1608000	The self-destruction is always higher
1608000	1609000	Than the rudeness
1609000	1611000	Which I think kind of equates to like
1611000	1612000	It's like
1612000	1613000	Like oh
1613000	1614000	Thick skin
1614000	1615000	And like he's fine
1615000	1617000	He's an equal opportunity offender
1617000	1619000	And he puts himself at the top of the list
1619000	1620000	Because he ends up
1620000	1622000	Being like thrown out of every bar
1622000	1623000	And blah blah blah
1623000	1624000	This is when you're
1624000	1625000	He's like Meowth
1625000	1626000	Like
1626000	1627000	Like Meowth
1627000	1628000	Like Meowth
1628000	1629000	That's a Pokemon
1629000	1630000	Is that one a Pokemon?
1630000	1631000	Yeah yeah
1631000	1632000	You guys know how to talk to your crowd
1632000	1633000	Oh yeah
1633000	1634000	But on the other hand
1634000	1635000	They're me man
1636000	1637000	On the other hand
1637000	1639000	I've never met anybody
1639000	1641000	I think I'm not exaggerating when I say this
1641000	1643000	I'm trying to think like
1643000	1644000	It's hard to think up here
1644000	1645000	But like
1645000	1646000	I think
1646000	1648000	I've never met anybody with
1648000	1652000	Your particularly sensitive whisker
1652000	1654000	About like
1654000	1656000	It's like
1656000	1657000	I'm trying
1657000	1658000	It's like
1658000	1660000	You can go like
1660000	1662000	From such a high
1662000	1663000	Like
1663000	1664000	And I'm not talking about
1664000	1665000	I'm talking about
1665000	1666000	On the wagon and just you
1666000	1667000	Like I'm not talking about
1667000	1668000	I'm saying
1668000	1670000	You can go from such a high mood
1670000	1671000	Like
1671000	1672000	And you're funny
1672000	1673000	And you're fun
1673000	1674000	And you're having a good time
1674000	1675000	And stuff
1675000	1676000	And then like
1676000	1677000	It seems like a bit at first
1677000	1679000	But you can take this rollercoaster plunge
1679000	1681000	And it really is tied to like
1681000	1685000	Like it's the most absurdly microscopic
1685000	1687000	Mention of
1687000	1689000	Of someone liking someone else
1689000	1691000	Like any kind of girl
1691000	1693000	Like we could be hanging out in a porch
1693000	1694000	And like
1694000	1695000	Oh the one that's so beautiful
1695000	1696000	And you could be like cracking me up
1696000	1698000	With your stories
1698000	1701000	Or like just being funny and cool
1701000	1702000	And then like
1702000	1703000	I
1704000	1705000	We're about thinking of the same thing
1705000	1706000	On the set of Great Mice
1706000	1708000	But also I hear stories from Dino
1708000	1709000	And I think it's happened before
1709000	1710000	With you and me
1710000	1711000	Where it's like
1711000	1712000	You go
1712000	1713000	Oh that cloud is shaped like
1713000	1714000	Like Paul Rudd
1714000	1715000	I love Paul Rudd
1715000	1716000	And then I was like
1716000	1717000	I'm going to get another lemonade
1717000	1718000	Do you want another lemonade?
1718000	1719000	I don't know
1719000	1720000	Why don't you get Paul Rudd another lemonade?
1720000	1723000	And it always seems like a bit
1723000	1724000	And I go like
1724000	1725000	Ha ha ha
1725000	1726000	And then I bring back the lemonade
1726000	1727000	And it's just like
1727000	1728000	Like this is good
1728000	1729000	You're so nice
1729000	1730000	Thank you
1730000	1731000	And like thank you
1731000	1732000	I really like hanging out with you
1732000	1733000	And I was like
1733000	1734000	What is it with Paul Rudd?
1734000	1735000	What is it?
1735000	1736000	Jesus Andy
1736000	1737000	Like so
1737000	1739000	That Paul Rudd thing never happened
1739000	1740000	Ha ha ha
1740000	1742000	It did happen with Nick Kroll
1742000	1743000	Yeah yeah
1743000	1745000	I mentioned Nick Kroll
1745000	1746000	Like on the set of Great Mice
1746000	1747000	It was like
1747000	1748000	He has a show
1748000	1749000	You guys probably know that
1749000	1750000	Great Mice show
1750000	1752000	And Nick had I guess just done it
1752000	1753000	And did a great job
1753000	1754000	Ha ha ha
1754000	1755000	But I was bringing it up
1755000	1756000	The thing is
1756000	1758000	You wouldn't shut up about him
1758000	1759000	How great he was
1759000	1760000	I did shut up
1760000	1761000	But he was trying to compliment you
1761000	1762000	When he brought it up
1762000	1763000	No
1763000	1764000	He was just talking about
1764000	1765000	I did
1765000	1766000	See?
1766000	1767000	No
1767000	1768000	I brought
1768000	1769000	I just had done it that day
1769000	1770000	I was
1770000	1771000	Where I was leaving
1771000	1772000	He didn't say
1772000	1773000	And you did real good today
1773000	1774000	He didn't even have that part in there
1774000	1775000	Ha ha
1775000	1776000	No we were
1776000	1777000	All about Nick
1777000	1778000	What about me?
1778000	1779000	Listen
1779000	1780000	I wouldn't
1780000	1781000	I brought it up
1781000	1782000	Because it was
1782000	1783000	I was connecting the dot
1783000	1784000	I was like
1784000	1787000	I haven't had this much fun since Nick Kroll was on it
1787000	1788000	Or something like that
1788000	1789000	It was like
1789000	1790000	Oh
1790000	1791000	I didn't care about that part
1791000	1792000	Yeah
1792000	1793000	I really didn't
1793000	1794000	Sorry
1794000	1795000	I was like
1795000	1796000	I was like
1796000	1797000	Why wouldn't
1797000	1798000	You heard
1798000	1799000	You heard
1799000	1800000	Haven't had fun Nick Kroll
1800000	1803000	And like think about the kind of weird monster I must be
1803000	1805000	Like through your eyes
1805000	1807000	If you think it's possible that you'd be shitting the bed
1807000	1808000	And in order to cope with it
1808000	1809000	I'd be like
1809000	1810000	I love Nick Kroll
1810000	1811000	He never
1811000	1812000	Never shits the bed
1812000	1814000	Oh it was worse than that
1814000	1818000	In my mind I honestly thought you were trying to take me out
1818000	1820000	Never trust your mind
1820000	1821000	Okay so
1821000	1822000	It's insane
1822000	1826000	It has historically steered you wrong
1826000	1829000	I think I had to call you and say
1829000	1831000	I think he's fucking with me
1831000	1832000	Yeah and I'm like
1832000	1833000	I doubt it
1833000	1835000	He's too lazy
1835000	1836000	I'm thinking about it now
1836000	1839000	He doesn't like confrontation at all
1839000	1841000	Like fucking with someone
1841000	1843000	Seriously I really did
1843000	1844000	I'm not lying
1844000	1845000	I thought he was fucking with me
1845000	1846000	And I thought
1846000	1847000	He was being mean
1847000	1848000	You're right I did
1848000	1849000	That is so embarrassing
1849000	1851000	But let's talk about that
1851000	1853000	Because I'm sure there's a lot of people listening
1853000	1854000	Well it probably happens every fucking day
1854000	1855000	I could relate to that
1855000	1856000	You know the coffee guy maybe
1856000	1857000	He was serious
1857000	1858000	He doesn't know me at all
1858000	1860000	I think people who are ultra sensitive
1860000	1862000	Portray themselves as not sensitive at all
1862000	1864000	And that's what you go out and you do
1864000	1866000	Well I think it's almost like cutting or something
1866000	1868000	It's like you develop like this
1868000	1871000	Because you know how fucking risky the world is
1871000	1873000	Yes that's what I want to talk about
1873000	1874000	Because I can relate
1874000	1875000	And I think a lot of people relate
1875000	1876000	That it's like you go
1876000	1877000	Oh my god
1877000	1879000	This world could fucking undo me
1880000	1881000	Like nothing
1881000	1882000	And so you
1882000	1883000	But that took a certain
1887000	1889000	Face on the playground or something
1889000	1890000	And it's like
1890000	1892000	We developed these really specific numbnesses
1892000	1893000	Like we
1893000	1895000	And people that gravitate towards microphones
1895000	1896000	And cameras and things
1896000	1897000	It's like
1897000	1899000	It's like this weird inversion
1899000	1900000	Where you
1900000	1902000	You callus yourself over
1902000	1905000	In all of the places that normal people
1905000	1906000	Would be sensitive
1907000	1908000	Because you just like
1908000	1910000	You just develop that cow catcher
1910000	1911000	On the front of your train
1911000	1912000	You're just like
1912000	1913000	Okay that's the spot
1913000	1914000	Where there's going to be impact
1914000	1916000	Like and then ironically
1916000	1917000	You put so much energy into that
1917000	1918000	You have these
1918000	1919000	Like it's like
1919000	1921000	If Batman just had naked flesh
1921000	1922000	Out of like here
1922000	1924000	But had like a bullet proof
1924000	1925000	Like titanium thing
1925000	1926000	And then it was just like naked
1926000	1928000	You could see his ribs and his acne here
1930000	1931000	And it's just like
1931000	1932000	Everybody was just like
1932000	1933000	Get him like that
1933000	1934000	And every time he did
1934000	1935000	He was like
1936000	1940000	I'm fascinated by these cow catchers on trains
1940000	1941000	They really have those?
1941000	1942000	Yes
1942000	1945000	They catch big swooping metal things
1945000	1946000	To catch cows?
1946000	1947000	No to get them along
1947000	1948000	Like
1948000	1949000	Oh!
1949000	1950000	It cuts down on her
1950000	1952000	And then the cow probably dies
1952000	1953000	Oh it dies
1953000	1954000	It saves the train
1956000	1957000	Oh that's nice
1957000	1958000	Do you think
1963000	1964000	Do you think that
1964000	1966000	Trains are an endangered species
1967000	1970000	Do you think that you project things that aren't there
1970000	1971000	Or do you think you're like
1971000	1972000	Is it about
1972000	1974000	Like I characterize it as a cat whisker
1974000	1975000	Me?
1975000	1976000	Yeah like
1976000	1977000	No my thing happened
1977000	1978000	I've been thinking about this recently
1978000	1979000	It happened
1979000	1980000	It went all the way back
1980000	1981000	It's happening again
1981000	1983000	But this time I know
1983000	1985000	I think I know what to do
1985000	1986000	And how to handle it
1986000	1988000	First of all I'm 50
1988000	1990000	So and I've been through it a bunch
1990000	1991000	But what happened
1991000	1992000	What happened is
1992000	1993000	We did the Ben Stiller show
1994000	1995000	And then all of the
1995000	1996000	I can't believe you're 50
1996000	1997000	You seem like
1997000	1998000	Six
1998000	2000000	A lot of 50 year olds do though
2000000	2003000	That's the new thing
2003000	2004000	Then
2004000	2006000	Then I just catapulted out of there
2006000	2007000	On to News Radio
2007000	2009000	And I played this
2009000	2011000	I remember the audition for News Radio
2011000	2013000	Paul Sims had me coming in
2013000	2014000	Read for the network and everybody
2014000	2015000	And the writers
2015000	2016000	And I did it
2016000	2017000	And I guess I fell flat
2017000	2019000	But before the audition
2019000	2020000	In the room I was talking like this
2020000	2021000	And I'm like
2021000	2022000	This is going to be fun right
2022000	2023000	This is going to be fun
2023000	2024000	Phil Harmon
2024000	2025000	And Dave Foley
2025000	2026000	And this is going to be wild
2026000	2027000	And so anyways
2027000	2028000	I'm going to do my audition
2028000	2030000	Blah blah blah blah blah
2030000	2031000	So yeah
2031000	2033000	Whatever you guys need from me
2033000	2034000	I'm ready
2034000	2035000	I'm like that
2035000	2036000	And then Paul Sims
2036000	2037000	Told me that I left
2037000	2039000	And everybody was disappointed
2039000	2040000	With my audition
2040000	2041000	And Paul said
2041000	2042000	Can I tell you something
2042000	2043000	Did you see how he was
2043000	2045000	Before the audition
2045000	2046000	Before he started reading the part
2046000	2047000	And after
2047000	2049000	That's how he's going to be
2049000	2051000	So we're going to write for him
2051000	2052000	And then that's what they did
2052000	2053000	And I became this kind of like
2053000	2055000	Warm and fuzzy character
2055000	2056000	That people on the street
2056000	2058000	Always wanted to just touch
2058000	2059000	And hug and all that
2059000	2061000	But I wasn't always that person
2061000	2064000	And so I built up this thing
2064000	2065000	Yeah I really did
2065000	2068000	I went full force into drugs
2068000	2069000	And alcohol
2069000	2071000	And I started like a punk band
2071000	2074000	And I made another persona
2074000	2076000	That that one I can't shake now
2076000	2077000	All right
2077000	2078000	I always felt like
2078000	2079000	And when I say something
2079000	2080000	Like I always felt
2080000	2081000	I'm not qualified
2081000	2082000	Like I
2082000	2083000	One of the things that I love about you
2083000	2085000	Is that you don't punish people like me
2085000	2088000	For just speculating and talking
2088000	2089000	Like I get
2089000	2091000	Back in the 90s
2091000	2095000	I would get mad at people for talking about you
2095000	2096000	Like the way that they did
2096000	2097000	Because I would be like
2097000	2099000	Because I have my own issues
2099000	2100000	And I'm like
2100000	2101000	The whole like
2101000	2104000	Oh you have a problem with substances or whatever
2104000	2106000	I just don't like the way normie norms handle it
2106000	2107000	Like I don't
2107000	2108000	And I don't like indulging that stuff
2108000	2109000	And I was like
2109000	2112000	In spite of the fact that I think now I'm 43 or 50
2112000	2113000	And it's like
2113000	2114000	I
2114000	2116000	I've had enough drinks with you
2116000	2117000	And been through
2117000	2118000	I've seen enough to think
2118000	2120000	I think it's a great idea for you to be sober
2120000	2121000	Like I really do
2121000	2122000	And like
2122000	2123000	But I
2123000	2124000	Why am I here?
2124000	2125000	I was like
2125000	2126000	Just planning my next relapse
2126000	2127000	I just
2127000	2129000	It's been almost two years
2129000	2130000	By the way
2130000	2131000	Which is fucking amazing
2131000	2132000	No!
2132000	2133000	It's not enough
2133000	2134000	Not enough
2134000	2135000	Okay
2135000	2137000	Don't applaud two years
2137000	2138000	God damn it
2139000	2141000	It's not an accomplishment people
2142000	2143000	It is though
2143000	2144000	Because you
2144000	2145000	Because you were on and off
2145000	2146000	Like a
2146000	2147000	It's so hard
2147000	2148000	Like a God damn yo-yo
2148000	2149000	I hate it
2149000	2150000	Two years is huge
2150000	2151000	I'm gonna drink again
2151000	2152000	I'm not gonna lie
2152000	2153000	Why?
2153000	2154000	Can't I?
2154000	2155000	Why?
2155000	2156000	Oh no
2156000	2157000	It's a nightmare
2157000	2158000	It's just a nightmare
2158000	2159000	I can't ever again
2159000	2160000	I can't even comprehend that
2160000	2162000	Did you have a timer set on your phone
2162000	2164000	That's now in that guy's hands
2164000	2165000	Is that
2165000	2166000	Was that
2166000	2167000	I have an app
2167000	2168000	Tell me how much time
2168000	2169000	How much time I have
2169000	2170000	Are we still good?
2170000	2171000	We're not
2171000	2172000	We're not cutting into that, right?
2172000	2173000	Because I know you have somewhere
2173000	2174000	To be after this
2174000	2175000	Oh that
2175000	2176000	Oh you're right
2176000	2177000	I have another show
2177000	2178000	Oh you're right
2178000	2179000	I'm sorry
2179000	2180000	He also has an app
2180000	2181000	About when he's gonna stop drinking
2181000	2182000	But this is
2182000	2183000	Delete that
2183000	2184000	Can I be honest with you?
2184000	2185000	This is far more important
2185000	2186000	No okay
2186000	2187000	I just want you to be doing
2187000	2188000	What you want to do
2188000	2189000	With all the information you can have
2189000	2190000	So here's the question
2190000	2191000	I want to ask you
2191000	2192000	Keep going though
2192000	2193000	I
2193000	2196000	I've
2196000	2198000	Seen your relationship with
2198000	2199000	Our medicine
2199000	2200000	I've seen your
2200000	2201000	Relationship with our
2201000	2202000	Wait
2202000	2203000	Did you talk about drugs and alcohol
2203000	2204000	As our medicine?
2204000	2205000	It really is
2205000	2206000	Do you know if I didn't have
2206000	2207000	Drugs and alcohol over all these
2207000	2208000	Last 20, 30 years
2208000	2209000	I started drinking when I was 14
2209000	2211000	So it's been like 30 or more years
2211000	2212000	I would have killed myself
2212000	2213000	I'm sorry
2213000	2214000	I really would have killed myself
2214000	2215000	And I
2215000	2216000	Or I would have been prescribed
2216000	2217000	Something
2217000	2218000	And maybe that would have worked
2218000	2219000	Maybe
2219000	2220000	I don't know I never did any of those
2220000	2221000	But drugs and alcohol work for me
2221000	2222000	And I love them
2222000	2223000	But the other
2224000	2225000	But the other
2225000	2226000	The other thing that works for you
2229000	2230000	The other thing that works for you
2230000	2231000	Is attention
2231000	2232000	Like is that a fair thing
2232000	2234000	This does take the place of that
2234000	2235000	When we were hanging out
2235000	2237000	We were doing that Comedy Central thing
2237000	2238000	And it was like
2238000	2239000	My
2239000	2240000	He was creating a show for me
2240000	2242000	He was creating the new
2242000	2243000	Andy Dick show for me
2243000	2244000	And then I don't know
2244000	2246000	Things got a little hairy
2246000	2247000	I don't know what happened
2247000	2249000	I remember just having a bunch of fun
2249000	2251000	Doing a lot of coke
2251000	2252000	Robin Williams was hanging
2252000	2253000	Out with us
2253000	2254000	We were having fun
2254000	2255000	Then he's like
2255000	2256000	I'm out
2256000	2258000	And then I see communities
2258000	2260000	Created by Dan Harmon
2260000	2261000	I don't think it happened like that
2261000	2262000	No it did
2262000	2263000	All of a sudden
2263000	2265000	Listen one more time
2265000	2268000	He just left to do his funny little show
2268000	2270000	That you guys all love
2270000	2272000	And then left me high and dry
2272000	2273000	This is just Andy
2273000	2274000	Just two drugs by myself
2274000	2275000	In the middle of a drink
2275000	2276000	And then all of a sudden he's gone
2276000	2278000	No there was a lot of shit that happened
2278000	2280000	In the middle of that drink
2281000	2283000	Well I don't remember that stuff
2283000	2284000	But
2284000	2285000	But I'm proud of that
2285000	2286000	I'm not mad about it
2286000	2288000	Because I would have left me
2288000	2290000	I wouldn't have even started
2290000	2291000	I didn't leave you
2291000	2293000	Comedy Central looked at the outline
2293000	2294000	That we turned in
2294000	2295000	And then said
2295000	2296000	No I know this is going to be
2296000	2297000	Kind of a stereotype
2297000	2298000	Because we bought that show
2298000	2299000	And now we don't want it
2299000	2300000	Har har har
2300000	2301000	And I was like
2301000	2302000	Harrity har
2302000	2303000	What?
2303000	2304000	It was Comedy Central
2304000	2305000	So you didn't leave
2305000	2306000	No I didn't leave
2306000	2307000	Oh
2307000	2308000	Oh yeah
2309000	2310000	I want to make sure
2311000	2312000	I want to know
2312000	2313000	So I should launch a community
2313000	2314000	Can you draw in your head
2317000	2318000	Just watch your episode
2320000	2321000	I mean it
2322000	2325000	I thought he was fucking with me with that
2326000	2328000	Listen I wrote you in community
2328000	2329000	And I'm like great
2329000	2330000	Is it a big part?
2330000	2331000	No
2332000	2333000	Is it a big part?
2333000	2334000	Not really
2335000	2337000	But you do a scene with Chevy Chase
2337000	2338000	Fuck yeah
2338000	2339000	I love the guy
2339000	2341000	Really and I know all your things with him
2341000	2342000	But I fucking love him
2342000	2344000	Because he's the original
2344000	2345000	He's like one of the great
2345000	2346000	He's just great
2346000	2347000	I really like
2347000	2348000	I know you
2349000	2350000	He was
2350000	2352000	And this one you must have been fucking with me
2352000	2354000	Because I get to the set
2354000	2355000	And I'm like
2355000	2358000	So my scene I see is with Chevy Chase
2358000	2359000	Maybe we should meet up
2359000	2361000	And we can talk about the scene
2361000	2362000	Oh he's not here
2363000	2364000	What yet?
2364000	2366000	He's not going to be here
2366000	2368000	You're going to be doing it on a green screen
2368000	2369000	Did you really
2369000	2370000	Did you look at the script
2370000	2371000	You're
2371000	2372000	We're putting you in a green screen
2372000	2373000	And we're going to shrink you down
2373000	2376000	You're going to be sitting on Chevy Chase's shoulder
2376000	2378000	So talk about a bit part
2378000	2380000	I was this fucking big
2381000	2383000	And there wasn't even a cardboard cutout
2383000	2385000	Of Chevy Chase to act with
2385000	2386000	I was by myself
2386000	2388000	You didn't even show up
2390000	2392000	I was doing a monologue
2392000	2393000	Take this camera
2393000	2394000	I had cast Amy Dick
2394000	2396000	As Chevy Chase's drug addiction
2396000	2398000	I didn't need to be there
2398000	2399000	And then that
2399000	2400000	It shoots itself
2400000	2401000	And that
2401000	2402000	But it's fine
2402000	2404000	He is the coffee guy from last night
2406000	2407000	That's my point
2407000	2408000	But I really
2408000	2409000	Fuck this time out
2409000	2410000	No way to be there
2410000	2411000	But unlike that coffee guy
2411000	2412000	I didn't like
2412000	2413000	I wasn't pretending not to know you
2413000	2414000	Yeah exactly
2414000	2415000	Exploited
2415000	2416000	That's the part that got me
2416000	2417000	When he pretended
2417000	2419000	That he wasn't doing what he was doing
2419000	2420000	That made me really mad
2420000	2421000	When he was like
2421000	2422000	I'm sorry
2422000	2423000	I just don't know who you are
2423000	2424000	Do it man
2424000	2425000	Oh I said it
2425000	2426000	I was
2426000	2427000	Proud
2427000	2428000	Yeah
2428000	2429000	But I just
2429000	2430000	You need a love
2430000	2431000	So can we draw
2431000	2432000	I want to try to draw a connection
2432000	2433000	Between the
2433000	2436000	The medicine that is attention
2436000	2437000	Like
2437000	2438000	Yeah yeah yeah
2438000	2439000	And you're one of those people
2439000	2440000	That really lights up
2440000	2442000	Like when people are focused on you
2442000	2444000	And like I said earlier
2444000	2446000	It's like to the point where
2446000	2447000	You could experiment
2447000	2448000	Like with that vocoder
2448000	2450000	Like we can turn the dial
2450000	2451000	Of mentioning Paul Rudd
2451000	2452000	And you can
2452000	2453000	I think that that's what happened
2453000	2455000	I think that's what I was getting at
2455000	2456000	Is that I think that
2456000	2458000	That the world saw
2458000	2459000	That how easy I am
2459000	2461000	I'm like a little bit of a whore
2461000	2462000	And then they're like
2462000	2463000	Now let's poke with them
2463000	2464000	And let's do that
2464000	2466000	And then it fucking drove me insane
2466000	2468000	And I've been to 20 different rehabs
2468000	2470000	I've lived like three years in a facility
2470000	2471000	I live in one right now
2471000	2473000	I'm in a facility
2473000	2474000	When I leave here I go
2474000	2476000	And I go back to a sober living
2476000	2477000	But it's nice right?
2477000	2478000	I love it
2478000	2479000	It's on the beach
2479000	2480000	You don't have to kill it
2480000	2481000	Sorry for that
2482000	2484000	And I'm the only one in this one house
2484000	2485000	I mean
2485000	2486000	I got it made
2486000	2487000	You could do all the drugs you want
2489000	2490000	That's the one thing
2491000	2492000	That's the one catch
2494000	2495000	That's how they get ya
2498000	2499000	You know I do think about that
2499000	2500000	If I took one fucking sip
2500000	2501000	It's gone
2501000	2502000	My house is gone
2502000	2503000	You would look at me different
2503000	2505000	You said it on stage with
2505000	2506000	I wouldn't look at you at all
2506000	2507000	You'd see the back of my head
2508000	2509000	I'd be running away
2509000	2510000	It was right next to us
2510000	2511000	And I said
2511000	2512000	I said that
2512000	2513000	I still want to drink
2513000	2514000	I want to drink right now
2514000	2515000	Tina Fey had a fucking glass of wine
2515000	2517000	Tucked into her cunt right there
2518000	2519000	Everybody's drinking
2519000	2521000	Scotch and Steve Colbert
2521000	2522000	Drinking and everyone
2522000	2523000	I'm like
2523000	2524000	I want to drink
2524000	2525000	You said if you drink
2525000	2526000	I'm leaving right now
2526000	2527000	And he means it
2527000	2528000	So like
2528000	2529000	I don't want him to leave
2529000	2530000	You've grown out there
2531000	2532000	Have you seen him drunk?
2533000	2534000	It's a nightmare
2534000	2535000	It's bad
2535000	2538000	So the medicine of attention
2538000	2539000	Right
2540000	2541000	Is it
2541000	2542000	I just want to talk about the relationship
2542000	2543000	Like
2543000	2544000	Cause there's a couple different models here
2544000	2545000	That we could
2546000	2547000	Use
2547000	2548000	Like is it
2548000	2549000	I'm curious like
2549000	2550000	In your mind is it like
2551000	2554000	Would it be easy to stay sober for 20 years
2554000	2556000	If during every minute of that 20 years
2556000	2557000	Everybody was like
2558000	2559000	Andy are you okay?
2559000	2560000	Are you alright?
2560000	2561000	You're so
2561000	2562000	You're very funny
2562000	2563000	You're beautiful
2563000	2564000	You're wonderful
2564000	2565000	Is it
2565000	2566000	I've been thinking about this
2566000	2567000	Is it when that needle goes off
2567000	2568000	And then it's like
2568000	2570000	That with like the other thing that makes me
2570000	2571000	Yes
2571000	2572000	That takes my brain
2572000	2573000	Cause we're talking about numbness
2573000	2574000	We're talking about
2574000	2577000	You have such a high degree of empathy then maybe
2577000	2579000	That you can feel people
2579000	2581000	Like you knew that guy was fucking around
2581000	2583000	Like you're hyper sensitive to that
2583000	2585000	That makes you a good entertainer
2585000	2587000	You're cursed to bear then
2587000	2589000	Is that like you're
2589000	2593000	That seismograph is designed to measure fucking
2593000	2595000	Kittens walking across the kitchen floor
2595000	2596000	So
2596000	2598000	So the Northridge quake is a little tough
2598000	2599000	Sometimes if somebody is like
2599000	2600000	Hey Andy
2601000	2602000	And you're like
2602000	2603000	I want to kill myself
2603000	2605000	If something really super bad happened
2605000	2606000	It would be just cursed
2606000	2608000	I mean you're talking to the two guys
2608000	2610000	Who love drinking more than anything
2610000	2611000	Who love
2611000	2613000	Who hate it when people don't drink right?
2613000	2615000	We hate it when people don't drink
2615000	2616000	Me and you
2616000	2617000	Me and you
2617000	2619000	No but and we love it when he doesn't
2619000	2620000	Yes
2620000	2622000	That just doesn't seem fair
2623000	2624000	But there's
2624000	2626000	There's got to be other things you can do that I can't
2626000	2627000	Like
2627000	2628000	Did you see Holy Hell?
2628000	2629000	Yes I did
2629000	2630000	I just saw that
2630000	2631000	I just saw it
2631000	2633000	God I have this weird thing that all celebrities
2633000	2634000	And me included
2634000	2636000	Create a mini fucking
2636000	2638000	What's a cult?
2638000	2639000	You have it
2639000	2641000	This is your little mini cult
2641000	2642000	No
2643000	2645000	Yes and it's not a bad thing
2645000	2647000	I kept looking at that guy going
2647000	2648000	He's not that bad
2648000	2650000	I want a cult
2650000	2651000	You have one
2651000	2652000	You have one
2652000	2653000	I do
2654000	2655000	Shit
2656000	2657000	But what do you think
2657000	2659000	Do you see that situation as untenable
2659000	2661000	And like is there an adjustment that you could make
2661000	2662000	Because I like
2662000	2664000	Like can we talk for a second just about therapy
2664000	2665000	Are you in therapy?
2665000	2666000	I mean it all the time
2666000	2668000	I live at that place
2668000	2669000	Our podcast is therapy
2669000	2670000	It really is
2671000	2674000	I approached Dino and begged him
2674000	2676000	I just asked him if he could please just hang out
2676000	2679000	Because I wanted to get to the bottom of why he
2679000	2681000	Left me in the first place years ago
2681000	2682000	He's just like
2682000	2683000	He just stopped talking to me
2683000	2684000	I couldn't get him on the phone
2684000	2686000	I'm like what?
2686000	2687000	That hurt me
2687000	2688000	My marrow
2688000	2691000	And we've never like sucked each other's cocks or anything
2691000	2692000	No he
2692000	2694000	I'm the only person he's never been attracted to
2696000	2698000	What are you gonna do?
2700000	2701000	Look at him
2703000	2706000	But yeah I mean there's like no wrong answers on that podcast
2706000	2707000	It's like yeah
2707000	2709000	Yeah black people's eyes pop out
2709000	2710000	Love it
2711000	2713000	Don't listen to the podcast
2713000	2715000	Don't listen to our podcast
2715000	2718000	He chops the n-bomb like for no reason
2718000	2719000	I knew it here
2719000	2720000	It's just no pull
2720000	2722000	I stopped doing it here when people started applauding
2722000	2724000	Then it got creepy
2724000	2725000	Yeah
2725000	2727000	But I think it's true about the millennials
2727000	2730000	You know they're new to the party
2730000	2732000	And we have to respect them
2732000	2734000	I think that it's like
2734000	2735000	Yeah but you can
2735000	2736000	Can you sense
2736000	2737000	And I think you can
2737000	2739000	Or maybe it's even more interesting if you can't
2739000	2740000	Because look what happened
2740000	2742000	You came out and you were like
2742000	2744000	Like a bull in a china shop over
2744000	2746000	But instead of china it was like hot buttons
2746000	2748000	For sale in this shop
2748000	2749000	It's not a shop
2749000	2750000	You're not supposed to be in there
2750000	2752000	You're a bull in a fucking racist tie ride
2754000	2755000	Every button you could push
2755000	2758000	And even though you're like you're being told like
2758000	2760000	Oh they don't like that and blah blah blah
2760000	2763000	Like you then all of a sudden
2763000	2764000	Five seconds later
2765000	2768000	Like we've switched gears into a one night show
2768000	2769000	With Andy Dick
2769000	2771000	Where you're telling stories
2771000	2772000	And people are leaned in
2772000	2773000	And they're sharing with you
2773000	2774000	Because you're talking about your pain
2774000	2776000	You're talking about what it means to be Andy Dick
2776000	2777000	In a Starbucks
2777000	2781000	You adapted because you're like a freaky stem cell
2781000	2783000	Like Mystique character
2783000	2785000	That's like ooh anything to
2785000	2789000	Because you love making people happy
2789000	2791000	But it has to be you
2791000	2792000	And that's like
2792000	2793000	Well that's all I have
2793000	2794000	Well I mean yeah
2794000	2796000	But you can't like
2796000	2797000	The only way
2797000	2798000	You're so
2798000	2799000	But it's not about that
2799000	2800000	You're happy
2800000	2801000	You're not happy that people are happy
2801000	2803000	You're happy that you make people happy
2803000	2805000	Like if someone next to you makes someone happy
2805000	2806000	You're going to be like
2806000	2807000	Why am I even here
2807000	2808000	On earth
2811000	2812000	That's exactly what happens
2812000	2813000	That's what it is
2813000	2814000	And by the way
2814000	2817000	It does happen but I'm better at that
2817000	2818000	And I know it
2818000	2819000	You weren't better in New York
2819000	2820000	That's what he's referencing
2820000	2822000	In New York City we did this
2822000	2823000	Our Skull Juice podcast
2823000	2825000	And that's what I was getting at that
2825000	2826000	I approached Dino
2826000	2827000	And I'm like
2827000	2828000	Can we
2828000	2829000	Can you be my friend
2829000	2830000	I miss you
2830000	2831000	And I just want to be
2831000	2832000	He's like
2832000	2833000	Let's start a podcast
2833000	2834000	And I'm like
2834000	2835000	I don't really
2835000	2836000	Fine
2836000	2837000	If it means you're going to be my friend
2837000	2838000	Let's do it
2838000	2839000	And then I thought
2839000	2840000	No one's going to listen to this
2840000	2841000	And we'll just talk
2841000	2842000	And I'm going to get to the bottom
2842000	2843000	Of why he left me
2843000	2844000	And I've been
2844000	2847000	I have a lot of insights after we talk a lot
2847000	2848000	And I go away hating you
2848000	2850000	But then I want to do another one
2850000	2851000	When I call him the next day
2851000	2853000	Can we do another one today
2853000	2855000	Yeah he loves hating me
2855000	2856000	And by the way
2856000	2857000	He hates doing the podcast
2857000	2858000	At one hour
2858000	2859000	He's like
2859000	2860000	We're done
2860000	2861000	I'm like
2861000	2862000	No
2862000	2863000	But in New York
2863000	2864000	And rightfully so
2864000	2865000	And fair enough
2865000	2866000	It was all about Dino
2866000	2867000	And that's fine
2867000	2868000	I wasn't fine with it
2868000	2869000	In New York
2869000	2870000	I wasn't fine with it
2870000	2871000	It was Dino
2871000	2872000	Created this thing
2872000	2873000	And it was Tina Fey
2873000	2874000	And Stephen Colbert
2874000	2875000	And all those people
2875000	2876000	I don't know if you've heard about it
2876000	2877000	And we were live on stage like this
2877000	2878000	And then what's his name
2878000	2879000	Louis CK showed up
2879000	2880000	And Scott Adset
2880000	2882000	And am I missing anybody?
2882000	2883000	And Smigel
2883000	2884000	And Smigel
2884000	2885000	And Triumph
2885000	2886000	The Insult
2886000	2887000	Comic Dog
2887000	2888000	And oh look
2888000	2889000	That's him
2889000	2890000	Oh there he is
2890000	2891000	It's a skeleton
2891000	2894000	And his eyes bugged out
2894000	2898000	And Dino created this night
2898000	2903000	I started having this great appreciation for you
2903000	2904000	And like
2904000	2907000	Stephen Colbert texted him and said
2907000	2910000	Hey I listened to your first Skulljuice podcast
2910000	2911000	And I'm like
2911000	2912000	He did?
2912000	2913000	He's like yeah
2913000	2914000	He texted him
2914000	2915000	And said
2915000	2916000	Yeah you were going to read the script that you got
2916000	2918000	That he had written with Stephen
2918000	2919000	And then you never got to it
2919000	2920000	Because it was all about me
2920000	2921000	You know we never got to the script
2921000	2922000	Yeah he's like
2922000	2923000	I listened to that whole fucking podcast
2923000	2924000	He was?
2924000	2925000	Oh he hated it
2925000	2926000	No I don't think he hated it
2926000	2927000	Oh
2927000	2929000	I was trying to get a laugh
2929000	2931000	But see I almost went into that spider
2931000	2932000	I know I know
2932000	2933000	Talking about
2933000	2934000	Yeah yeah
2934000	2935000	Everyone was scared
2935000	2940000	So but then Dino just said offhandedly
2940000	2942000	Why don't we just do it live on stage
2942000	2943000	Within a week
2943000	2944000	Everybody's live fucking on stage
2944000	2945000	Because Dino sent us to it
2945000	2946000	And they're all on stage
2946000	2947000	That's Dino's day
2947000	2948000	You guys are like almost
2948000	2949000	You're the opposite on one axis
2949000	2951000	Which is that Dino does not
2951000	2952000	He doesn't give a fuck
2952000	2953000	I don't care
2953000	2955000	And then everyone feels safe I guess
2955000	2957000	I guess it's that old thing
2957000	2958000	We all know it
2958000	2959000	Secret he does care about
2959000	2960000	That's what I'm getting
2960000	2961000	No he does
2961000	2963000	I don't know if it's that secret
2963000	2964000	Okay okay
2964000	2965000	But he doesn't
2965000	2966000	Well anyways
2966000	2967000	Here's more
2967000	2968000	I don't obsess but
2968000	2970000	Listen we've got Paul Rudd here tonight
2971000	2972000	We need one of the chairs
2972000	2975000	But you have a hard out right?
2975000	2976000	If you want you can
2976000	2978000	This Paul Rudd here for real
2978000	2980000	No Paul Rudd's here
2980000	2981000	He really is
2981000	2982000	Oh then I'll leave
2982000	2984000	Why am I here?
2984000	2986000	Why was I here at all?
2986000	2988000	Don't you have to go?
2988000	2990000	Stephen Colbert's here
2990000	2993000	Paul Rudd really is here?
2993000	2994000	Yeah yeah
2994000	2996000	No Paul Rudd's not here
2996000	2997000	Jesus Christ
2997000	2999000	You got me
2999000	3000000	No I'm mad
3000000	3001000	I do have to go
3001000	3003000	I have a show in Burbank at 9 o'clock
3003000	3005000	Let's thank Andy Dick for burying his soul
3005000	3006000	And he'll come back
3006000	3007000	Thank you
3007000	3009000	Andy Dick everybody
3015000	3018000	He's even working out the kinks
3018000	3020000	Is this his handler here?
3020000	3021000	Do we have the net?
3021000	3023000	It'll be okay
3023000	3026000	Well that was a weird event
3027000	3031000	But now it's time for some stranger things
3034000	3036000	I should go too right in clear the stage
3036000	3037000	No you stay here
3037000	3038000	Alright
3038000	3039000	Let's bring out Matt and Ross Duffer
3039000	3041000	The Duffer Brothers
3047000	3049000	When you double book
3053000	3055000	Hi guys
3055000	3061000	Sorry I braced you for having to wait and stuff
3061000	3062000	And you were fine with it
3062000	3064000	Yeah thanks for putting us after
3064000	3065000	Andy Dick
3065000	3066000	Yeah
3066000	3070000	We're just coasting, gliding on the momentum baby
3070000	3072000	Alright so
3072000	3074000	So everybody wants to know
3074000	3075000	How do you tell them apart?
3075000	3076000	I'll tell you
3076000	3077000	I figured it out
3077000	3079000	They're kind of like the Dupluss brothers
3079000	3081000	Yeah except the...
3081000	3082000	You can't tell them apart either
3082000	3083000	They're not twins though
3084000	3086000	The Duplusses I'd have to Google them
3086000	3087000	And then look and go
3087000	3089000	Okay yeah I can't tell them apart
3089000	3091000	But then the guys, the animals guys
3091000	3092000	Who aren't even brothers much less twins
3092000	3094000	I will never be able to tell them apart
3094000	3095000	But these guys are easy
3095000	3099000	Matt has a shock of white hair in front
3099000	3101000	Which is a welcome Matt
3101000	3103000	For your remembering his name
3105000	3108000	Ross is raw
3108000	3109000	He's not cooked yet
3109000	3112000	So he doesn't have a gray hair thing
3113000	3116000	How do you remember the word mnemonic?
3118000	3120000	I think of the word phenomenon
3122000	3126000	I think of pneumonia
3126000	3129000	Because I need to have mnemonics
3129000	3131000	Because I'm such a cold person
3131000	3133000	I can't tell people apart
3133000	3136000	I do, that's how I remember the word mnemonic
3136000	3138000	Alright you guys are into your
3138000	3140000	Well there's nothing I can
3140000	3142000	You guys are...
3142000	3144000	He's not going to start drinking again is he?
3144000	3147000	Yeah thanks to everyone here
3147000	3149000	But what did we do? We didn't do anything
3149000	3152000	They groaned every time I said I didn't want him to drink
3152000	3155000	No I hate it when he says
3155000	3156000	I'm going to...
3156000	3158000	I really thought he was going to drink in New York
3158000	3160000	Just don't
3160000	3162000	I'm amazed that he didn't do New York
3162000	3165000	And by the way I'm talking now to people I hated in the 2000s
3165000	3167000	I was like fuck you guys you don't care
3167000	3169000	But it's like now it's like we're old
3169000	3172000	We're so old that it's like now I'm like actually sincerely like
3172000	3174000	Come on man don't drink
3174000	3176000	Oh I care I work with them
3177000	3179000	Oh hi guys
3181000	3184000	So you guys are now writing Season 2 Stranger Things
3184000	3185000	Correct
3190000	3194000	So first let's talk about what everyone keeps calling a title sequence
3194000	3196000	But it's not a sequence of anything
3196000	3201000	It's a neon letters in an amazing font with a cool John Carpenter type song
3201000	3204000	Who's this composer?
3204000	3206000	Oh who did the music for?
3206000	3208000	These guys named Kyle and Michael
3208000	3212000	They're part of this band called Survive out of Austin
3212000	3215000	And we made this little...
3215000	3218000	When we tried to sell the show we made this little trailer
3218000	3221000	When we put all these clips from old movies
3221000	3223000	Together with Spielberg or Carpenter or whatever
3223000	3225000	Try to get the vibe across
3225000	3228000	And some of it was John Carpenter music that we used
3228000	3231000	But then for the find the end, the epic end of this trailer
3231000	3235000	We couldn't find anything and we used music from this band
3235000	3237000	And so when it came to the show we just...
3237000	3239000	Yeah we called them up
3239000	3242000	They had regular, one of them sold used synthesizers
3242000	3247000	You don't make money in an instant mental synth band
3247000	3249000	You can't make money
3249000	3251000	You don't have a living so I called them up
3252000	3256000	First we had to convince Netflix and the producers
3256000	3259000	They let us do it and then we called them
3259000	3262000	Would you quit your jobs to do this?
3262000	3264000	They're like fuck yeah
3264000	3266000	Are you kidding me?
3266000	3269000	Now they'll be fine because your show is big enough
3269000	3271000	They can just go on tour now
3271000	3273000	They're touring with the synth band
3273000	3275000	It's crazy
3275000	3277000	People will be like yeah it's great
3278000	3281000	I always wonder about when you see a Toyota commercial
3281000	3283000	And you hear a song you really like
3283000	3285000	And then you look it up and you're like oh
3285000	3287000	And then you buy the album and it's the only...
3287000	3289000	I'm not saying these guys are that at all
3289000	3292000	I have no idea but I always wonder about the phenomenon
3292000	3295000	Of being a band who's like...
3295000	3297000	Who all of a sudden either...
3297000	3299000	Well look at the 88
3299000	3301000	I wonder sometimes
3301000	3303000	They were big enough
3303000	3305000	They were using...
3306000	3309000	Joe Russo said we should use them for the theme song of community
3309000	3311000	Then they do the thing
3311000	3313000	I always wonder what their relationship is
3313000	3315000	If they hate it or love it
3315000	3317000	I'm sure they love it
3317000	3319000	I don't know what's going to happen
3319000	3321000	They're barely scraping by right now
3321000	3323000	But I'm sure they're going to be great
3323000	3325000	Are you guys from Austin?
3325000	3327000	No, North Carolina
3327000	3329000	Durham, North Carolina
3329000	3331000	Asheville?
3331000	3333000	You just said Durham
3334000	3336000	I have a neurological disorder
3338000	3340000	You may have heard of it in Wired magazine
3340000	3342000	It's pretty chic
3342000	3344000	I diagnosed myself on the internet
3348000	3351000	So here's something that's funny and interesting about you guys
3351000	3353000	You are twins
3353000	3356000	And then we met at lunch
3356000	3358000	The waitress came over and said
3358000	3360000	Are you guys twins?
3360000	3362000	And she said identical
3362000	3364000	And I've never heard this response before
3364000	3366000	You guys said, we don't know
3366000	3368000	We might be
3368000	3370000	We assume we are
3370000	3372000	You could clear that up with a blood test
3372000	3374000	But you've gotten to the point where you don't want to know
3374000	3377000	We don't know what it would psychologically do to us
3377000	3379000	I think if it came back and we were identical
3379000	3381000	We'd feel fine and we'd be the same
3381000	3383000	But if it came back that we weren't
3383000	3385000	I don't think you are
3385000	3387000	You're not even wearing the same shirt
3387000	3389000	I don't want to hear that
3389000	3391000	He bases all of his knowledge about twins
3391000	3395000	On like, chimpanzee shows from the 60s
3395000	3397000	I don't want to know
3397000	3399000	I think it could fuck us up
3399000	3401000	But that's not even what shocks me
3401000	3403000	What shocks me is that it's possible in this modern era
3403000	3406000	You guys were born into a stainless steel honeycomb
3406000	3408000	You were born into THX1138
3408000	3410000	You were born in Underground 2
3410000	3412000	Andy's still here
3412000	3414000	Oh shit
3414000	3416000	I didn't
3416000	3418000	I love that show so much
3418000	3420000	I could go on and on and on
3420000	3422000	He doesn't love his own show
3422000	3424000	Oh, you know what?
3424000	3426000	There's a Volkswagen blocking my car
3426000	3428000	That's why I came back
3428000	3430000	I didn't know that this was people from Stranger Things
3430000	3432000	This is fucking, why can't I stay?
3436000	3437000	This is fucking amazing
3437000	3439000	That show, I gotta talk to you guys
3439000	3441000	About why and how it's so amazing
3441000	3443000	Alright, well go ahead, David
3443000	3445000	No, this is your show
3445000	3447000	I gotta go, but can somebody move there?
3447000	3449000	No, we want you to talk to them now
3449000	3451000	I have a show, there's a whole audience
3451000	3453000	Fuck your show
3453000	3455000	You're mean
3455000	3457000	Come on, ask them a few questions
3457000	3461000	I'll go get the Volkswagen out of the way
3461000	3463000	Whose car is that?
3463000	3465000	Well, there's so many good things
3465000	3467000	The acting and the writing
3467000	3471000	And the way it's so
3471000	3473000	You really, you know what?
3473000	3475000	I relate to Winona Ryder
3475000	3477000	I will relate to that character
3477000	3479000	The way that, I don't know if you guys
3479000	3481000	Directed her in this way or whatever
3481000	3483000	But she is that person
3483000	3485000	Where everything about her
3485000	3487000	And she even says, I know I seem crazy
3487000	3489000	I know, I know, but I'm not
3489000	3491000	I saw things in the wall
3491000	3493000	And the lights are
3493000	3495000	And the more she screams
3495000	3497000	The more crazy she sounds
3497000	3499000	And I love that
3499000	3501000	Yeah, you talk the lamps and shit
3501000	3502000	I love it
3502000	3503000	You connected to that
3503000	3505000	Yeah, I did, yeah
3505000	3507000	We cast Winona, I think we had one script written
3507000	3509000	And we cast her
3509000	3511000	And it was a very different role
3511000	3513000	It was like a tough, smoking Long Island mom
3513000	3515000	And then we had Winona
3515000	3517000	And I love the idea of Winona
3517000	3519000	And then we started to talk about Richard Dreyfus
3519000	3521000	And Close Encounters
3521000	3523000	We started talking about what's cool about Winona
3523000	3525000	What we love about Winona
3525000	3527000	And that's what I love about television
3527000	3529000	It can evolve
3529000	3531000	All the kids were cast
3531000	3533000	We had one script written and we rewrote that script
3533000	3535000	And we just wrote to all of them
3535000	3537000	We wrote to Winona and they made the show
3537000	3539000	I think they made the show so much better and more interesting
3539000	3541000	Everything was much more stereotypical
3541000	3543000	All of them are great
3543000	3545000	And the other guy I related to
3545000	3547000	The kids are amazing, everybody's so good
3547000	3549000	You did such a great job with casting
3549000	3551000	And writing and the way you shoot it
3551000	3553000	That other guy that I just
3553000	3555000	Fucking love him is the lead man
3555000	3557000	The police officer
3557000	3559000	What a fucking train wreck
3559000	3561000	Immediately he's popping pills
3561000	3563000	He's drinking, he hates his job
3563000	3565000	But he's a fucking hero
3565000	3567000	The first time
3567000	3569000	Remember that first time
3569000	3571000	When he just fucking knocked the guy out
3571000	3573000	That was back in the 70's when you can do that
3575000	3577000	He just fucking knocked him out
3577000	3579000	He said I'm gonna do it and I'm like
3579000	3581000	Fuck you, that's a real hero
3581000	3583000	I can't have him listen to this podcast
3583000	3585000	No but the funny thing
3585000	3587000	Why he didn't like doing that
3587000	3589000	He's so pumped up about it
3589000	3591000	He loves punching people
3591000	3593000	He will love everything that you're saying
3593000	3595000	He's a real Andy Dick
3595000	3597000	By the way
3597000	3599000	The way he plays it
3599000	3601000	No one's moving that Volkswagen
3601000	3603000	So I'm gonna go out and key it in a second
3603000	3605000	Yeah we gotta move it
3605000	3607000	Uh oh, he really will
3607000	3609000	I mean
3609000	3611000	Thanks Andy
3611000	3613000	Thank you
3618000	3620000	But back to my medical question
3622000	3624000	She's like how do you not
3624000	3626000	Because your babies that were born at the same time
3626000	3628000	How do they not have your DNA
3628000	3630000	Like in a hologram
3630000	3631000	They're just going like
3631000	3633000	They either are or aren't identical twins
3633000	3635000	That's the thing I don't understand
3635000	3637000	It's like you slip through the slats of an Orwellian
3637000	3638000	I don't know
3638000	3639000	This is what happens when you're born in the south
3639000	3641000	I don't know
3643000	3645000	Well speaking of which you guys were born
3645000	3647000	So you guys like you're in the 30
3647000	3648000	I won't betray you
3648000	3650000	You're 30-ish
3652000	3654000	That's the new young
3656000	3659000	You're being nostalgic in this show
3659000	3661000	For a time that didn't actually
3661000	3663000	Like for me
3663000	3665000	I keyed it
3666000	3668000	There's no guarantee that the person's in this room
3668000	3670000	You had no right to do that
3670000	3672000	Well he should have went out and fucking moved it
3672000	3674000	No because he might be a block away
3674000	3676000	He doesn't know that you want his car moved
3676000	3678000	Oh
3682000	3684000	That's when I was like 10 years old
3684000	3686000	That's like filled with all these memories for me
3686000	3688000	But you guys are like
3688000	3691000	You know, you're fondly recalling
3691000	3693000	It's a time in cinema really
3693000	3695000	It's like your favorite movies when you were kids, right?
3695000	3697000	Yeah, I think it's just
3697000	3699000	It's weird because it's
3699000	3701000	Part of it is our childhood
3701000	3703000	We're hanging out with our friends
3703000	3705000	And doing nerdy stuff and going on adventures
3705000	3707000	So that was a huge part of our childhood
3707000	3710000	And the other part was watching these VHS tapes
3710000	3712000	Over and over again
3712000	3714000	And so it all becomes like a blur
3714000	3715000	When I look back on it
3715000	3716000	It's just a blur
3716000	3717000	Those were my favorite movies
3717000	3719000	And were they better then?
3719000	3721000	I mean because like so
3721000	3722000	That kind of
3722000	3723000	I always felt
3723000	3725000	Like this thing is like I felt like
3725000	3727000	The movies were better
3727000	3729000	They're always better
3729000	3732000	But you guys are younger enough than me
3732000	3734000	That if that weren't true
3734000	3737000	That you guys would just be fondly recalling
3737000	3739000	Clueless or something
3739000	3741000	That you'd be like that's R-E-T
3741000	3743000	And I'd be like well okay
3743000	3744000	And feeling like a curmudgeon
3744000	3746000	Like I guess we just all melt and die
3746000	3748000	And think that when we were 10
3748000	3750000	There was a Golden Age of Cinema
3750000	3751000	But you guys are kind of like
3751000	3752000	That's true
3752000	3753000	And I think that in the 80s
3753000	3755000	There was like a joy there
3755000	3757000	I think that John Carpenter really represents
3757000	3760000	Because here's a guy that did his own music
3760000	3762000	For his own horror movies
3762000	3765000	And that synth feel
3765000	3767000	That they live in
3767000	3770000	Yeah we didn't think about them as like old movies though
3770000	3771000	I mean they felt very modern
3771000	3772000	I didn't watch The Goonies
3772000	3774000	And I wasn't like oh this is like an old movie
3774000	3776000	It felt very current to me
3776000	3777000	So I didn't differentiate
3777000	3778000	The only thing that
3778000	3779000	Didn't experience it theatrically
3779000	3780000	That was the only thing
3780000	3781000	But it felt very
3781000	3782000	It felt very new to me
3782000	3783000	So I didn't think about it
3783000	3784000	Did you ever become conscious
3784000	3785000	Before we responded to it
3785000	3786000	Before you got to this point
3786000	3787000	Was there a point
3787000	3788000	Where you guys were like
3788000	3789000	Oh I think we're 80s files
3789000	3791000	I don't know
3791000	3792000	No
3792000	3794000	No not at all
3794000	3795000	Short answer
3795000	3796000	No not at all
3796000	3797000	It makes me nervous actually
3797000	3798000	Being associated
3798000	3799000	I feel like a lot of people
3799000	3801000	Know a lot more about it
3801000	3802000	Than we do
3802000	3804000	Winona knows a lot more than we do
3804000	3806000	She's like it wasn't like this
3806000	3808000	Just keep talking
3809000	3811000	You're on camera
3811000	3812000	She knows so much
3812000	3814000	She's in the weird
3814000	3815000	Like every movie
3815000	3816000	Like she mentioned these movies
3816000	3817000	I feel like I know a lot of movies
3817000	3818000	And I don't know what the hell she's taught
3818000	3820000	Like I don't even know
3820000	3821000	What movie
3821000	3822000	She's talking about like
3822000	3823000	Going IMDb or whatever
3823000	3824000	It has like 700 votes
3824000	3825000	It's like no one has seen it
3825000	3826000	Except Winona
3826000	3827000	Is that her thing?
3827000	3828000	Is she like a cinephile
3828000	3829000	She watches so much
3829000	3830000	She watches so much
3830000	3832000	And most of it's like 80s to 90
3832000	3833000	Like it's like weird
3833000	3835000	But yeah
3835000	3836000	I don't know if you even know
3836000	3837000	Like Audrey Rose
3837000	3838000	She's obsessed with this
3838000	3839000	No idea
3839000	3840000	And Dini Hopkins thing
3840000	3841000	It's like a bad
3841000	3842000	It's like an exorcist rip off
3842000	3843000	That they didn't hate you
3843000	3844000	But she's like you got to see Audrey Rose
3844000	3845000	I'm like yeah yeah yeah
3845000	3847000	I want to watch Audrey Rose
3847000	3849000	And it was like that for three months
3849000	3850000	And I finally watched it
3850000	3851000	And I was like I don't know
3851000	3852000	But then
3854000	3855000	If she says you got to watch
3855000	3857000	Martin Scorsese's Dracula
3857000	3858000	Say no
3859000	3860000	Fucking
3860000	3862000	That's a good soundtrack though
3862000	3863000	Uhh
3864000	3866000	What's Matthew Modine like?
3866000	3869000	Oh he gave the weirdest interview yesterday
3869000	3870000	It was like in Forbes
3870000	3873000	And he was talking about how upset he was
3873000	3875000	That people were calling him evil
3875000	3876000	Because of the character he played in the show
3876000	3878000	Because when we were shooting the show
3878000	3879000	I just let him
3879000	3880000	Oh well
3880000	3881000	Yeah
3881000	3882000	He thought he was being sympathetic
3882000	3883000	Like he thought he was
3883000	3884000	But everything he was doing that he thought was sympathetic
3884000	3886000	Was really creepy
3886000	3889000	And so we just let it go
3889000	3890000	Right?
3890000	3892000	Like it's like with Eleven
3892000	3893000	Like when he was
3894000	3895000	Like it's like with Eleven
3895000	3897000	Like when he touches her nose
3897000	3898000	Right
3898000	3899000	And you know I was just
3899000	3900000	Ross and I just looked
3900000	3901000	And we're like
3903000	3904000	And we're like yeah let's go
3904000	3905000	Let's go
3905000	3906000	Let's do it
3906000	3907000	It wasn't a direction
3907000	3908000	It wasn't a direction
3908000	3909000	No
3910000	3911000	No
3911000	3912000	He just said no
3912000	3913000	He goes I'm going to touch her nose
3913000	3914000	Like this
3914000	3915000	Like point
3915000	3916000	And we're like ha ha
3916000	3917000	And then we do the first take
3917000	3918000	And he does it
3918000	3919000	And we're like oh shit
3919000	3920000	He was really
3920000	3921000	He was
3921000	3922000	That was actually
3923000	3924000	Because he has like so
3924000	3925000	And I know he was concerned
3925000	3926000	He's like
3926000	3927000	Brenner has like ten lines
3927000	3928000	In the whole thing
3928000	3929000	He's not very
3929000	3930000	He doesn't have a lot
3930000	3932000	And so it's him finding these
3932000	3933000	He's making these
3933000	3935000	These weird choices
3935000	3936000	Anytime he's on screen
3936000	3937000	Because he knows
3937000	3938000	He only has
3939000	3940000	Like I was like
3940000	3941000	What is that accent you're doing?
3941000	3942000	Like what is that
3942000	3943000	He's like I don't know
3943000	3944000	What accent?
3944000	3945000	Give her the flag
3945000	3946000	I'm not doing an accent
3946000	3947000	I'm like there's something
3947000	3948000	Like I can't figure it out
3948000	3949000	What is it?
3949000	3950000	He's like I don't know
3950000	3951000	There's nothing
3952000	3953000	But like it fucking worked
3953000	3954000	It cut through
3954000	3955000	You know
3955000	3956000	It's kind of like
3956000	3957000	It's everything I wanted to hear
3957000	3958000	About Matthew Modine
3959000	3960000	Because I was thinking like
3960000	3961000	If I quantum leaped
3961000	3962000	Into Matthew Modine
3962000	3963000	And I look in the mirror
3963000	3964000	And I'm like
3964000	3965000	I see Matthew Modine
3965000	3966000	And I go oh boy
3966000	3967000	And that's the episode of
3967000	3968000	Quantum Leap
3968000	3969000	I would spend that episode
3969000	3970000	I'd be like
3970000	3971000	You know how the fuck
3971000	3972000	Do you break out
3972000	3973000	Of being Matthew Modine, man?
3973000	3974000	It's like
3974000	3975000	It's kind of like an invitation
3975000	3976000	To just like
3976000	3977000	Take it as it
3977000	3978000	Lays, man
3979000	3980000	I want to think that
3980000	3981000	It's like some kind of weird
3981000	3982000	Oh yeah
3982000	3983000	He's really interested
3983000	3984000	In his
3984000	3985000	In his full metal jacket stories
3985000	3986000	Because he was there for
3986000	3987000	And a lot of people
3987000	3988000	You made a Kubrick movie
3988000	3989000	You're like
3989000	3990000	10 years
3990000	3991000	Yeah, yeah
3991000	3992000	And a lot of people
3992000	3993000	A lot of people associate that
3993000	3994000	Like that
3994000	3995000	You know
3995000	3996000	That was right when he was
3996000	3997000	Like the most desired
3997000	3998000	In Hollywood
3998000	3999000	And he's gone for two years
3999000	4000000	You sign a new Kubrick movie
4000000	4001000	You're gone forever
4001000	4002000	You sign your life away
4002000	4003000	Like there's no
4003000	4004000	There's no end date
4004000	4005000	And then at the end of it
4005000	4006000	Kubrick says
4006000	4007000	Now put film in the camera
4007000	4009000	Did you ever hear that story?
4010000	4011000	The Shining
4011000	4012000	Yeah, he shoots you
4012000	4013000	Is it like
4013000	4014000	Shelley Duvall
4014000	4015000	Shelley Duvall
4015000	4016000	Shelley Duvall
4016000	4017000	Shelley Long
4017000	4018000	Yeah, by the way
4018000	4019000	I meant
4019000	4020000	Frances Fort Coppola's Dracula
4020000	4021000	But
4021000	4022000	Right
4022000	4023000	I like it when the train
4023000	4024000	Fuck his nightmare
4024000	4025000	Is writing over the top of the book
4025000	4026000	But yeah
4026000	4027000	He drove
4027000	4028000	He made her do a thousand takes
4028000	4029000	No, I mean
4029000	4030000	He fucks with
4030000	4031000	She was going out of her mind
4031000	4032000	He fucks with him
4032000	4033000	He gets to what
4033000	4034000	What he needs out of him
4034000	4035000	He does it
4035000	4036000	All right
4036000	4037000	Well, I cut you off
4037000	4038000	Now I have something to say
4038000	4039000	Jesus, you should have kept talking
4039000	4041000	You know the thing I'm talking about
4041000	4042000	What are you guys thinking?
4042000	4043000	Garage doors
4048000	4049000	Okay, so
4049000	4050000	Wait, did his character
4050000	4051000	I can't even remember
4051000	4052000	Did he
4052000	4053000	Did he
4053000	4054000	Because I remember him
4054000	4056000	Being not as scared as he should be
4056000	4057000	That his neck would get
4057000	4058000	Telekinetically snapped
4058000	4059000	Like
4059000	4061000	I remember him walking down the hall
4061000	4062000	And like
4062000	4063000	And she's like
4063000	4064000	Snap, snap
4064000	4065000	And they're like
4065000	4066000	Their necks are like
4066000	4067000	Snap, snap
4068000	4069000	I didn't know she was going to do that
4069000	4070000	I mean like
4070000	4071000	Wait, now
4071000	4072000	Telekinesis isn't real
4072000	4073000	You can't pretend
4074000	4075000	You're like doing like
4075000	4076000	The thing they did on
4076000	4077000	Behind the scenes on Gremlins 2
4077000	4078000	And they're like
4078000	4079000	Oh, Maguai wants his coffee
4079000	4080000	Oh, come on
4080000	4081000	Don't insult us
4084000	4085000	Don't try to conjure that
4085000	4086000	Part of the 80s
4088000	4089000	We're savvy people
4089000	4090000	It's Los Angeles
4098000	4100000	She wasn't supposed to have mental powers
4103000	4105000	It's clearly a show about a monster
4105000	4106000	From the upside down
4106000	4107000	Like that's enough
4107000	4108000	Like I was
4108000	4110000	You know adding her was weird
4110000	4111000	She showed up
4111000	4112000	She was bald
4112000	4113000	She snapped people's necks
4113000	4114000	And we put her in the moon
4119000	4120000	You guys are kind of famously
4120000	4121000	I mean
4122000	4124000	It's an overnight thing
4124000	4125000	Like I don't know if that offends you
4125000	4126000	To say that
4127000	4128000	There's maybe a trail of like
4128000	4129000	Very hard work
4129000	4130000	I'm sure you didn't come out of a dumpster
4130000	4131000	And walk into Netflix
4131000	4132000	Correct
4134000	4135000	It might be insulting to you guys
4135000	4136000	When people are celebrating
4136000	4137000	Who are these guys?
4137000	4138000	Where did they come from?
4138000	4140000	But where did you come from?
4144000	4146000	Take us from birth to the night
4146000	4148000	Before you sell this pitch
4150000	4151000	Just real quick
4151000	4153000	We already focused on the birth
4153000	4154000	For a while
4154000	4155000	Well yeah
4155000	4156000	I think
4156000	4157000	Well we've always want
4157000	4158000	We've since
4158000	4159000	I think we got our
4159000	4160000	We got our
4160000	4161000	High 8 camera
4161000	4162000	And it was 3rd grade
4162000	4163000	And we started making movies then
4163000	4164000	And we always knew
4165000	4166000	We wanted to do
4166000	4168000	We wanted to make movies
4168000	4169000	And then we went to film
4169000	4170000	So it's still
4170000	4171000	High 8 was like
4171000	4172000	That's still analog
4172000	4173000	Yeah I know
4173000	4174000	I mean we weren't editing
4174000	4175000	We had like
4175000	4176000	You know we had two jacks
4176000	4177000	And we had
4177000	4178000	You know we were playing
4178000	4179000	Danny Elfman
4179000	4180000	Like our first movie
4180000	4181000	It was like a
4181000	4182000	Magic the Gathering adaptation
4182000	4183000	Which like
4183000	4184000	Yeah they read it
4184000	4185000	And they're like
4185000	4186000	Oh the fucking Duffers want to do
4186000	4187000	I'm like that was 4th grade
4187000	4190000	Or 3rd grade
4190000	4191000	I don't want to do it now
4191000	4193000	But yeah so yeah
4193000	4194000	And then we did that
4194000	4195000	When you guys edited with i8
4195000	4196000	Do you have to use two?
4196000	4197000	No we just cut in camera
4197000	4198000	Oh okay
4198000	4199000	And then eventually
4199000	4200000	We got
4200000	4201000	Because there wasn't
4201000	4202000	Then there was like
4202000	4203000	A dual VHS editing thing
4203000	4204000	And then
4204000	4205000	And then when we were in high school
4205000	4206000	iMovie came out
4206000	4207000	Which was great
4207000	4208000	And then you know
4208000	4209000	We learned on iMovie
4209000	4210000	And then we went to
4210000	4211000	And then we went to film school
4211000	4212000	And we made some bad stuff
4212000	4213000	And then
4213000	4214000	And then
4214000	4215000	And then we wrote our first script
4215000	4216000	Which got us
4216000	4217000	An agent
4217000	4218000	Where was film school?
4218000	4219000	That was at Chapman
4219000	4220000	University in Orange County
4220000	4221000	Oh by the way we have a lot of
4221000	4222000	Columbia alum here
4222000	4223000	Oh yeah
4223000	4224000	Columbia College
4224000	4225000	Oh yeah
4225000	4226000	Which is where you and Andy went
4226000	4227000	Yeah yeah
4227000	4228000	I dropped out but
4228000	4229000	And so it's okay
4229000	4230000	Because as you can hear
4230000	4231000	From the applause
4231000	4232000	They're not a famously
4232000	4233000	Proud school
4233000	4234000	Yeah
4234000	4236000	What you just heard
4236000	4237000	Is called the Columbia
4237000	4239000	The Columbia Chair
4239000	4240000	Yeah
4240000	4241000	They're a stealth college
4242000	4243000	Anyways sorry
4244000	4245000	I don't even know how we
4245000	4246000	I mean you know
4246000	4247000	There's
4247000	4248000	I mean it's just a series of
4248000	4249000	I mean everyone
4249000	4250000	It's a series of rejection
4250000	4251000	Rejection, rejection, rejection
4251000	4252000	I mean it's like even film school
4252000	4253000	It's like USC didn't want us
4253000	4254000	You didn't want us
4254000	4255000	You couldn't get anywhere
4255000	4256000	So you just
4256000	4257000	We went up at Chapman
4257000	4258000	And we just
4258000	4259000	You just kept writing
4259000	4260000	And we were like
4260000	4261000	We need to write our way in
4261000	4262000	Because no one's going to give us anything
4262000	4263000	I think that was the only
4263000	4264000	Before we went to college
4264000	4265000	Is the sense of like
4265000	4266000	We're going to make this
4266000	4267000	Amazing short film
4267000	4268000	And they're going to give us
4268000	4269000	You know
4269000	4270000	This giant movie
4270000	4271000	Swingers it
4271000	4272000	Yeah you're going to
4272000	4273000	Yeah exactly
4273000	4274000	The old festival mindset
4274000	4275000	Yeah but then
4275000	4276000	You realize how
4276000	4277000	How hard that is
4277000	4278000	How dead that game is
4278000	4279000	Any festival
4279000	4280000	Every festival is rejected
4280000	4281000	I mean like
4281000	4282000	So you just get
4282000	4283000	You just
4283000	4284000	The good thing is
4284000	4285000	There's two of us
4285000	4286000	So we like delusional together
4286000	4287000	And then we just keep
4287000	4288000	You know keep going at it
4288000	4289000	And then
4289000	4290000	Do you guys pump each other up
4290000	4291000	Or are you
4291000	4292000	Bring each other down
4292000	4293000	Pump each other up
4293000	4294000	Well okay so
4294000	4295000	How does that work?
4295000	4296000	Like how does that
4296000	4297000	Like is it
4297000	4299000	Is it like if one of you
4299000	4300000	Is up
4300000	4301000	The other is
4301000	4302000	It balances
4302000	4303000	And says let's not get cocky
4303000	4304000	I think yeah
4304000	4305000	Yeah yeah
4305000	4306000	If he's being like
4306000	4307000	Yeah if he's being obnoxious
4307000	4308000	Or vice versa
4308000	4309000	I'd say like
4309000	4310000	You're being a douche
4310000	4311000	You know or like
4311000	4312000	Or you sounded like a douche
4312000	4313000	Or
4313000	4314000	That sounded really nice Ross
4314000	4315000	You know or whatever
4315000	4316000	I mean whatever so
4316000	4317000	I guess that's what we do
4317000	4318000	And then
4318000	4319000	But you guys have had moments
4319000	4322000	You got a season two
4322000	4323000	Or was that
4323000	4324000	There must have been
4324000	4325000	Some moment when you
4325000	4326000	Went out to your
4326000	4327000	Black Volkswagen
4327000	4328000	Oh shit
4328000	4329000	Oh fuck
4329000	4330000	They famously
4330000	4331000	Uh oh
4331000	4333000	And closed the doors
4333000	4334000	And both of you
4334000	4335000	Neither of you was telling
4335000	4336000	The other one
4336000	4337000	Not to get cocky anymore
4337000	4338000	Like you guys
4338000	4339000	Do you make out
4339000	4340000	When that happens?
4340000	4342000	I was going to ask you
4342000	4343000	Did you guys ever
4343000	4344000	Jack off together?
4344000	4346000	Well the
4346000	4347000	Out of the heels of
4347000	4348000	Okay
4348000	4349000	It feels
4349000	4350000	It feels real
4350000	4351000	Coming from us
4351000	4352000	I guess
4352000	4353000	Those questions
4353000	4355000	We don't have to wait
4355000	4356000	For an answer
4356000	4357000	The answer is no
4357000	4358000	I'm going to wait
4358000	4361000	I'm going to be here all night
4361000	4363000	But do you guys collectively
4363000	4364000	Both go up
4364000	4365000	Way up
4365000	4366000	And ever go way
4366000	4367000	I would say
4367000	4368000	Yeah I'd say so
4368000	4369000	Yeah I think we go up
4369000	4370000	Yeah yeah
4370000	4371000	Because stuff is not going
4371000	4372000	Right we just
4372000	4373000	You know attack each other
4373000	4374000	It's bad
4374000	4375000	It's not
4375000	4376000	I mean it's not
4376000	4377000	I mean it depends
4377000	4378000	But uh
4378000	4379000	Here's a
4379000	4380000	This might be a
4380000	4381000	I forgive you if you want
4381000	4382000	To just lie
4382000	4383000	About the answer to this
4383000	4384000	Because it's like
4384000	4385000	It's not a charismatic
4385000	4386000	Question to answer honestly
4386000	4387000	In a conversation with somebody else
4387000	4388000	Where I was
4388000	4389000	I don't
4389000	4392000	Like do you guys think
4392000	4395000	Did you think before you
4395000	4396000	Uh
4396000	4397000	Cross that threshold
4397000	4398000	Where it was like
4398000	4399000	Alright we got it
4399000	4400000	Now we're taken care of
4400000	4401000	Regardless of
4401000	4404000	Of what's supposed to be
4404000	4405000	Like this
4405000	4406000	You'll be working for a while now
4406000	4407000	You're fine
4407000	4408000	Um
4408000	4409000	And uh
4409000	4410000	But before that
4410000	4411000	There's a time of like
4411000	4413000	As most people experience
4413000	4414000	It's like
4414000	4415000	Am I supposed to
4415000	4416000	Am I
4416000	4417000	Are we not supposed to be
4417000	4418000	Doing this
4418000	4419000	Are we supposed to wash dishes
4419000	4420000	In that phase
4420000	4421000	Which is
4421000	4422000	Which most people experience
4422000	4423000	For much longer of their lives
4423000	4424000	Than the other stuff
4424000	4425000	Me included
4425000	4426000	Like I have more memories
4426000	4427000	From that time
4427000	4429000	During that time
4429000	4431000	Reward my candor
4431000	4432000	Uh
4432000	4433000	During that time
4433000	4435000	I just kept assuming
4435000	4436000	It was going to work out
4436000	4437000	Yeah
4437000	4438000	Yeah yeah
4438000	4439000	And I don't know if that's
4439000	4440000	White male privilege
4440000	4441000	Or if that's
4441000	4442000	I say like
4442000	4443000	I like make fun that
4443000	4444000	We were delusional
4444000	4445000	We just knew
4445000	4446000	I just felt that
4446000	4447000	It was going to work
4447000	4448000	Uh
4448000	4449000	You have to keep
4449000	4450000	But the reason
4450000	4451000	I think actually
4451000	4452000	The weird thing is
4452000	4453000	It only
4453000	4454000	We've only found
4454000	4455000	Any success at all
4455000	4456000	When it was pure panic
4456000	4457000	Because we didn't know
4457000	4458000	What else we were going to do
4458000	4459000	And we were out of money
4459000	4460000	And it was just like
4460000	4461000	We're fucked
4461000	4462000	And like
4462000	4463000	I don't even think
4463000	4464000	You know
4464000	4465000	I remember like walking
4465000	4466000	My Starbucks
4466000	4467000	And being like
4467000	4468000	I don't
4468000	4469000	Those priesthood jobs
4469000	4470000	Are like hard to get man
4470000	4471000	Like I don't know
4471000	4472000	Yeah
4472000	4473000	Like that's
4474000	4475000	Cody's roommate's job is
4475000	4479000	She goes to Costco
4479000	4482000	And she doesn't even work for Costco
4482000	4483000	That job's hard to get
4483000	4484000	She works for a
4484000	4485000	Yeah
4485000	4486000	Lotion company
4486000	4487000	Because she goes
4487000	4488000	So she goes to Costco
4488000	4489000	And says like
4489000	4490000	Is one of those people at Costco
4490000	4491000	That's like
4491000	4492000	Hey do you want to try some lotion
4492000	4493000	For free
4493000	4494000	She works on commission
4494000	4495000	Like I don't even know how
4495000	4496000	It's legal
4496000	4497000	Like it's just sort of like
4497000	4498000	Like she might make
4498000	4499000	Zero dollars in a day
4499000	4500000	Like it's like
4500000	4501000	Anyways
4501000	4502000	Bad economy
4503000	4504000	Or best one ever
4504000	4505000	But it's like
4505000	4506000	Fucking fragmented
4506000	4507000	But okay
4507000	4509000	Why did I get too real of that?
4509000	4510000	Yes
4510000	4511000	Yes
4511000	4512000	Fucking
4512000	4513000	Like there's that
4513000	4514000	I used to go like
4514000	4515000	Oh man
4515000	4516000	I'm going to have to move back to Milwaukee
4516000	4517000	And then
4517000	4518000	I remember saying that out loud to somebody
4518000	4519000	And somebody was like
4519000	4520000	Is there someone in Milwaukee
4520000	4522000	Waiting for you to come back?
4522000	4524000	And for that time only
4524000	4525000	I was like
4525000	4526000	No
4526000	4527000	God no
4527000	4528000	And I was like
4528000	4529000	But I just kind of kept
4529000	4530000	It's delusional
4530000	4531000	It's delusional
4531000	4532000	And I was like
4532000	4533000	I was in the shower this morning
4533000	4534000	You're welcome
4534000	4536000	And I was thinking about that
4536000	4537000	Like
4537000	4538000	I was like
4538000	4539000	Is that
4539000	4541000	Is that a good quality or a bad quality?
4541000	4542000	Because I'm kind of like
4542000	4545000	Reconciling that with the whole kind of cultural awareness
4545000	4546000	Now that we're having
4546000	4547000	It's like
4547000	4549000	Are we just fucking douchey privileged people?
4549000	4550000	It's like
4550000	4552000	That's just a symptom of luxury
4552000	4553000	Of like
4553000	4554000	Well yeah
4554000	4555000	You wait a couple years
4555000	4557000	And another white dude helps you out
4557000	4558000	Yeah
4558000	4559000	I don't know
4560000	4561000	I don't think it happens like that
4561000	4563000	Let me be real clear here
4563000	4564000	I think it's hard work
4564000	4565000	And nothing else
4567000	4569000	No handouts for anybody
4569000	4571000	And if your skyscraper is the second tallest now
4571000	4572000	Just wait
4572000	4573000	And one day
4575000	4576000	It's going to be the tallest
4576000	4577000	And it's going to be
4577000	4578000	Because you worked hard
4579000	4581000	Because you sacrificed
4581000	4583000	Spencer knows what he's talking about
4583000	4584000	I mean this guy
4584000	4585000	He's like
4585000	4587000	On two shows as an actor
4587000	4588000	He's executive producing
4588000	4590000	And he's your chauffeur
4591000	4592000	And how does that happen?
4592000	4593000	That guy works hard
4593000	4594000	Yeah
4595000	4596000	Okay so
4596000	4597000	You guys are
4597000	4598000	You guys are in the writers room right now
4598000	4599000	Working on season two
4599000	4600000	Yeah
4600000	4601000	So the things that we're allowed to know
4601000	4602000	Are
4602000	4603000	Because you would watch that
4603000	4605000	I watch a show called Stranger Things
4605000	4606000	I watch it for ten episodes
4606000	4607000	It's serialized
4608000	4610000	For all I know
4610000	4612000	In keeping with the John Carpenter tradition
4612000	4613000	Or something like that
4613000	4615000	That the second season is going to be like
4615000	4617000	Hey it's called Stranger Things
4617000	4618000	It's like True Detective
4618000	4619000	And it's like
4619000	4620000	All of a sudden
4620000	4622000	It's like 1973 in Detroit
4622000	4623000	And they're like
4626000	4627000	My name's
4627000	4628000	My name's Roger McClintock
4628000	4629000	And I've seen Stranger Things
4629000	4631000	In this case I'm on
4632000	4633000	She says she's a witch
4633000	4634000	But I don't believe in
4634000	4635000	The only thing I believe in
4635000	4636000	Is my revolver
4638000	4640000	And everyone's either booing
4640000	4641000	Or cheering
4641000	4642000	But that's not the case
4642000	4643000	I know that from talking to you guys
4643000	4644000	And the public knows
4644000	4645000	You guys are
4645000	4646000	It's these characters
4646000	4648000	It's Winona and her kids
4650000	4652000	And now even Stranger Things will happen
4653000	4654000	Yeah we wanted to
4654000	4655000	We wanted to see it as like
4655000	4656000	It's like a year later
4656000	4657000	And we're trying to treat
4657000	4658000	As much as we can
4658000	4659000	Even though it's a scary word
4659000	4661000	Treat it like a sequel
4661000	4662000	Just because there aren't
4662000	4663000	Very many good ones
4663000	4664000	But the good ones are really good
4664000	4665000	Right?
4665000	4666000	And so the hope is that
4666000	4667000	You've got to have a million
4667000	4668000	Stranger Things come down
4668000	4669000	And then have Space Marines be like
4669000	4670000	Lock and load
4670000	4671000	Yeah exactly
4672000	4674000	There's twenty upside-downs
4676000	4678000	Why did she put her in charge?
4684000	4685000	It's aliens
4692000	4694000	You watch Halloween
4694000	4695000	And then you watch Halloween 2
4695000	4696000	When you're a kid
4696000	4697000	I mean you guys were kids
4697000	4698000	When you saw it too I'm sure
4698000	4699000	But when I was a kid
4699000	4700000	It was like
4700000	4701000	It was happening kind of
4701000	4702000	It's like
4702000	4703000	Watch Halloween
4703000	4704000	It was like the original
4704000	4705000	It's like the birth of Michael Myers
4705000	4706000	Oh it's the sequel
4706000	4707000	It picks up where it left off
4707000	4708000	And now he's killing people
4708000	4709000	In a hospital
4709000	4710000	With a scalpel
4710000	4711000	Then you watch Halloween 3
4711000	4712000	It's called Season of the Witch
4712000	4713000	Of the worst
4713000	4714000	And it's about like a microchip
4714000	4715000	In the back of a mask
4715000	4716000	And there's a mad toy manufacturer
4716000	4717000	That wants to enact
4717000	4718000	A Celtic tradition
4718000	4720000	And you always think
4720000	4721000	When you're a consumer back
4721000	4722000	That I was like
4722000	4724000	How could they not understand?
4724000	4726000	But now you've probably already
4726000	4727000	Experienced enough to understand
4727000	4728000	Of course that happens
4728000	4730000	Because nothing happens
4730000	4732000	Like the way it should
4732000	4733000	The decisions that are made
4733000	4734000	Aren't happening
4735000	4737000	John Carpenter did an interview
4737000	4738000	And he was like
4738000	4740000	Well we did Halloween
4740000	4742000	It was like this amazing movie
4742000	4743000	Our plan the entire time
4743000	4744000	Was going to be to always
4744000	4746000	Do a new movie every Halloween
4746000	4747000	That's all we wanted to do
4747000	4749000	It was going to be an anthology
4749000	4750000	It was like
4750000	4752000	He didn't even want Halloween
4752000	4754000	To be so successful
4754000	4757000	That Halloween 2 was demanded
4757000	4758000	To the point where
4758000	4759000	I don't even think he worked on it
4759000	4760000	I don't think he was allowed to
4760000	4761000	I don't even know
4761000	4762000	Like
4762000	4763000	It was like
4763000	4764000	Oh yeah
4764000	4765000	Someone else will take care of this
4765000	4766000	Because it's just
4766000	4767000	Fucking money is pouring out
4767000	4768000	It's like when you hit oil
4768000	4769000	And it's just
4769000	4770000	In the movies
4770000	4771000	And it's just gushing out
4771000	4772000	And you're like
4772000	4773000	Where's all that oil going?
4773000	4774000	And it's like
4774000	4775000	Yeah exactly motherfucker
4775000	4777000	Get some barrels over here
4778000	4779000	That's what's happening
4779000	4780000	With you guys right?
4780000	4781000	I mean
4781000	4782000	You could say yes to that
4782000	4784000	Without vilifying anybody
4784000	4785000	It's just like
4785000	4786000	That is the state of the union
4786000	4788000	Like you guys didn't expect
4788000	4789000	Yeah but like Netflix
4789000	4790000	Was it
4790000	4791000	They didn't invest in it going
4791000	4792000	This is going to be a one year
4792000	4794000	Like it was always going to be
4794000	4795000	Plan to be
4795000	4797000	You know keep going
4797000	4799000	So we had to go in with that mindset
4799000	4801000	That was the intention
4801000	4802000	But do you think
4802000	4803000	Keep going
4803000	4804000	Do you think that their attitude
4804000	4805000	Changed it all about
4805000	4806000	Like based on
4806000	4807000	I don't even know
4807000	4808000	Well who even knows what numbers
4808000	4809000	They look at but
4809000	4810000	I don't know
4810000	4811000	We don't know
4811000	4812000	No we don't know
4812000	4813000	I mean they really honestly don't tell us
4813000	4814000	And like so
4814000	4815000	I mean we're just trying to do
4815000	4816000	I mean it's really scary
4816000	4817000	I don't know
4817000	4818000	I mean now
4818000	4819000	Like never before have we been
4819000	4820000	In a position where anyone cared
4820000	4821000	About what we were doing
4822000	4824000	Yeah it's fucking terrifying
4824000	4825000	Which is like a huge luxury
4825000	4826000	I've realized though
4826000	4827000	You know what I mean
4827000	4828000	Like because it comes from
4828000	4829000	A much more pure place
4829000	4830000	And now there's like all this noise
4830000	4831000	And I'm like you know
4831000	4832000	I'm like neurotic
4832000	4833000	And I'm thinking about
4833000	4834000	What other people are going to think about it
4834000	4835000	I'm like that's bad
4835000	4836000	That's bad that's bad
4836000	4837000	I gotta stop doing that
4837000	4838000	And do you guys have each other to turn to
4838000	4839000	For that
4839000	4840000	Yeah we can stop thinking about that
4840000	4841000	And then you know
4841000	4842000	And then we're just trying
4842000	4843000	As much as possible
4843000	4844000	To just write you know
4844000	4845000	What we think is cool
4845000	4846000	And what we want to see
4846000	4847000	And not worry about like
4847000	4849000	Longevity or franchiseability
4849000	4850000	Or any of that shit
4850000	4851000	And just like
4851000	4852000	Just write a cool second season
4852000	4854000	And then worry about the rest later
4854000	4857000	Which is not necessarily how everyone wants us to be doing it
4857000	4859000	But I think it's the best thing
4859000	4860000	And I think it's going to result
4860000	4861000	You know in the best thing
4861000	4862000	But I don't know
4862000	4864000	Because I see all these filmmakers I admire
4864000	4866000	And they mess up on sequels
4866000	4867000	And you know
4867000	4869000	Like Netflix doesn't even like us talking about sequels
4869000	4870000	Because it makes them nervous
4870000	4871000	Because there's so many bad ones
4871000	4872000	So
4872000	4873000	But it's just
4873000	4874000	It's not a traditional
4874000	4875000	But it's a TV show
4875000	4876000	I mean kind of
4876000	4877000	No but it's not traditional though
4877000	4878000	And like it is
4878000	4879000	Like it is
4879000	4880000	You know it built
4880000	4881000	A climax
4881000	4882000	And it ends
4882000	4883000	And the main tension is resolved
4883000	4884000	So
4884000	4885000	So do you
4885000	4886000	It's different
4886000	4887000	Do you think when you say
4887000	4888000	That they're nervous about the sequel thing
4888000	4889000	Do you think
4889000	4890000	What they
4890000	4891000	They're more
4891000	4892000	It's more like the word sequel
4892000	4893000	It's more like the word sequel
4893000	4894000	But we like using it just because
4894000	4895000	We like seeing it as
4895000	4896000	Yeah this
4896000	4897000	It's you know
4897000	4898000	A new tension
4898000	4899000	That then also gets resolved
4899000	4900000	It's always important to us
4900000	4901000	Like not to do
4901000	4902000	The killing thing
4902000	4903000	In season one
4903000	4904000	Where it's like
4904000	4905000	We always got Wilbur O reason
4905000	4906000	Oh no you got Snatcher Wave
4906000	4907000	I got Archer Demogorg
4907000	4908000	Yeah you know
4908000	4909000	We got to go
4909000	4910000	Get that
4910000	4911000	It's like
4911000	4912000	We want to do different
4912000	4913000	We want to do new different stuff
4913000	4914000	You know
4914000	4915000	And so
4915000	4916000	I don't know
4916000	4917000	I don't know
4917000	4918000	What's the word
4918000	4919000	We're excited about it
4919000	4920000	As long as we're excited about it
4920000	4921000	I feel like we're fine
4921000	4922000	We're good
4922000	4923000	Can you describe the worst version of the show
4923000	4927000	The worst version of season two
4927000	4931000	As you see it in the eyes of
4931000	4934000	The person that wants the worst thing for the show
4934000	4937000	Like the thing that is your worst nightmare
4937000	4938000	I know I know
4938000	4939000	It's sort of
4939000	4940000	It's the
4940000	4941000	Because I love Home Alone
4941000	4942000	It was one of my favorite movies
4942000	4943000	Right so
4943000	4944000	But when I was like a kid
4944000	4947000	And Home Alone 2 came out
4947000	4948000	Like I was like 8 or whatever
4948000	4949000	I was like
4949000	4950000	What the fuck is this
4950000	4951000	It's like
4951000	4954000	It's the exact same thing
4954000	4957000	They've just slotted in the pigeon lady for the shovel guy
4957000	4958000	Right
4958000	4959000	I know
4959000	4962000	Do you think that's
4962000	4963000	I mean
4963000	4964000	This is bullshit
4964000	4965000	Is that your worst nightmare
4965000	4966000	That's the worst nightmare
4966000	4967000	Instead of like communicating
4967000	4969000	Like 11's lost in the Upside Down
4969000	4970000	They have to try to communicate
4970000	4971000	Why not 12
4971000	4972000	And 11 starts
4972000	4973000	And you know
4973000	4974000	And Winona starts to communicate with magnets
4974000	4975000	Right
4975000	4976000	And magnets start to move
4976000	4977000	And like
4977000	4978000	That's like
4978000	4979000	That's my worst nightmare of the show
4979000	4980000	Like I'm not interested in that at all
4980000	4981000	And do you think
4981000	4983000	I bet you can't answer this question honestly
4983000	4984000	Because I think
4984000	4985000	But it's like
4985000	4986000	The question I want to ask
4986000	4987000	Is like
4987000	4988000	Do you actually think
4988000	4989000	Because I think
4989000	4993000	Netflix is justifiably like deified right now
4993000	4994000	I mean
4994000	4995000	They're like
4995000	4996000	Kind of beyond HBO
4996000	4997000	At their
4997000	4998000	Still going peak
4998000	4999000	Because at HBO
4999000	5000000	You could kind of
5000000	5001000	There was
5001000	5003000	It was still born from a
5003000	5005000	Non-Silicon Valley model
5005000	5006000	And so now
5006000	5007000	Like
5007000	5008000	Netflix has combined
5008000	5010000	The prestige of HBO
5010000	5012000	And the success of 80's NBC
5012000	5014000	With the
5014000	5015000	Like
5015000	5016000	Fuck you
5016000	5017000	We're doing it different
5017000	5018000	And we're not sharing our thought process
5018000	5019000	Of Silicon Valley
5019000	5020000	And it's kind of like
5020000	5021000	Terrifying and tiddling
5021000	5022000	I love it
5023000	5025000	It gets a little boring hearing pitches
5025000	5027000	Like having a little shitty studio in Burbank
5027000	5028000	And every time you hear a pitch
5028000	5029000	You're kind of like
5029000	5030000	So where should we take this out?
5030000	5031000	Netflix?
5031000	5032000	It's like
5032000	5033000	Yeah well that's like saying
5033000	5035000	I'd like to be on TV please
5036000	5037000	And it's kind of like
5037000	5039000	All of a sudden you're back to being 10 years old
5039000	5040000	But I think it's a good thing
5040000	5041000	And I
5041000	5042000	Anyways
5042000	5043000	But I guess what I was going to ask
5043000	5044000	But you can't answer this
5044000	5045000	Is
5045000	5047000	Do you really think that they
5047000	5051000	Do you think that they would want to see that formulaic
5051000	5053000	Like plugged in thing or
5053000	5054000	I mean ultimately
5054000	5055000	I mean I do honestly
5055000	5056000	But they
5056000	5057000	They're
5057000	5058000	They're banking on us
5058000	5059000	And then like
5059000	5060000	If I make
5060000	5061000	If I make
5061000	5062000	You know they're not
5062000	5063000	They're not writing the show
5063000	5064000	So if I make
5064000	5065000	I make
5065000	5066000	You know compelling
5066000	5067000	I make an argument
5067000	5068000	I explain why we want to do
5068000	5069000	What we want to do
5069000	5070000	They back us
5070000	5071000	And so like
5071000	5072000	And I
5072000	5073000	It's so crazy
5073000	5074000	They did this in the first place
5074000	5075000	It's crazy they backed us in the first place
5075000	5076000	I don't know why
5076000	5077000	I still don't know why
5077000	5078000	Crazy
5078000	5079000	So yeah
5079000	5080000	I mean yeah
5080000	5081000	We had no
5081000	5082000	There's no reason
5082000	5083000	Anyone would let us
5083000	5084000	Should let us show run anything
5084000	5085000	And never
5085000	5086000	Show run or
5086000	5087000	Only show run
5087000	5088000	And we never
5088000	5089000	The movie was literally dumped
5089000	5090000	Like no one saw it
5090000	5091000	Like it's on
5091000	5092000	I still don't understand
5092000	5093000	I mean I think
5093000	5094000	I think Andy Dick had something to do with it
5094000	5095000	Yeah
5095000	5096000	Oh he has their ear
5096000	5097000	I know
5097000	5098000	He has Netflix here
5098000	5099000	They might have like
5099000	5100000	That's what I love
5100000	5101000	I feel like they're
5101000	5102000	Like I love the rebel spirit of it
5102000	5103000	Like that they have
5103000	5104000	I don't want them to lose it
5104000	5105000	You know
5105000	5106000	And I hope that they don't
5106000	5107000	I mean because that's
5107000	5108000	What I think it's given them so much success
5108000	5109000	So I just hope they keep doing it
5109000	5111000	I hope they keep making crazy fucking decisions
5111000	5112000	Yeah
5112000	5113000	Like our show
5113000	5114000	Yeah and I don't know
5114000	5115000	If they're that crazy
5115000	5116000	I think it's
5116000	5117000	The funny thing about TV
5117000	5118000	That I've watched happen
5118000	5120000	Is that the definition of crazy
5120000	5122000	And like breaking the mold
5122000	5124000	It's practical
5124000	5126000	It's basically algorithmic
5126000	5128000	Because the algorithm of television
5128000	5129000	Until such times they make a computer
5129000	5131000	That can write indirect television
5131000	5133000	The algorithm suggests
5133000	5135000	That the smart thing to do
5135000	5137000	As like FX would say
5137000	5140000	Like the guy who's ass I kiss the most
5140000	5141000	John Landgraf
5141000	5143000	Like when he talks about TV
5143000	5144000	He goes like
5144000	5146000	We don't know how to make good TV
5146000	5149000	What we know works is statistically
5149000	5152000	If you just like make deals with people
5152000	5153000	That you like
5153000	5154000	And you kind of like
5154000	5155000	It's like
5155000	5157000	You just have to like keep making it
5157000	5159000	And then the good stuff like works
5159000	5160000	And the bad stuff
5160000	5161000	It's like
5161000	5162000	It's the same as in physics
5162000	5163000	Where it's like
5163000	5165000	Everybody worked from
5165000	5168000	Making weird shit up to justify Newtonian stuff
5168000	5170000	Like call Newton's laws
5170000	5171000	The Nielsen's maybe
5171000	5173000	And it's just like
5173000	5174000	Well why is
5174000	5176000	If an apple falls and hits your head
5176000	5177000	Which makes perfect sense
5177000	5179000	Then how come when you turn a flashlight on
5179000	5180000	In a train car
5180000	5181000	The light hits the thing
5181000	5182000	And it's like
5182000	5183000	Oh that's easy
5183000	5184000	There's a boogie man
5184000	5185000	And then Einstein is like
5185000	5186000	What if blah blah blah
5186000	5187000	And everyone's like
5187000	5188000	No
5188000	5189000	And that's me
5189000	5190000	Einstein
5190000	5192000	No it's John Landgraf
5192000	5193000	No it's
5193000	5194000	Ah fuck it
5194000	5195000	I'm drunk
5195000	5196000	Where's Andy?
5196000	5197000	The
5197000	5198000	Anyways
5198000	5200000	I like the algorithmic
5200000	5204000	I love the possibly apocryphal story of them going
5204000	5206000	Of how House of Cards was like
5206000	5207000	People keep
5207000	5210000	You know that they did a spreadsheet
5210000	5211000	And it said Kevin Spacey
5211000	5214000	And political thrillers equals
5214000	5215000	Blah blah blah
5215000	5216000	Even if that's not true
5216000	5218000	I don't mind living in that world
5218000	5219000	You're punching shit at
5219000	5220000	I know
5220000	5221000	I mean that's before they buy
5221000	5223000	They run whatever numbers they run
5223000	5225000	I mean I don't know what it is
5225000	5226000	They're plugging it into something
5226000	5228000	But isn't that what we want though?
5228000	5230000	Because we're not Jackson Pollock
5230000	5232000	We want approval
5232000	5233000	And we want to know
5233000	5234000	That we're good people
5234000	5235000	Because people like it
5235000	5236000	It's not like we punched this in and said
5236000	5238000	Oh this would be good to write
5238000	5239000	We wrote what we're into
5239000	5240000	Whatever it
5240000	5242000	No it was a stupid thing to write really
5242000	5244000	I mean you're writing a show about
5244000	5245000	I mean no one wanted to
5245000	5247000	When we're pitching this around
5247000	5248000	It's like
5248000	5249000	It's their kids and they're chasing a monster
5249000	5250000	And they're like
5250000	5251000	So it's a kids show
5251000	5252000	And it's like
5252000	5253000	It's a kids show
5253000	5254000	There's also this
5254000	5255000	You know what I mean
5255000	5256000	Like people
5256000	5257000	It was hard for people to comprehend
5257000	5258000	So it's not
5258000	5259000	For us it was not writing it
5259000	5260000	From like
5260000	5262000	Let's sell this and make this hit show
5262000	5263000	It was like
5263000	5264000	Let's just try to write something
5264000	5265000	That we want to see
5265000	5266000	And then hopefully
5266000	5267000	And then
5267000	5268000	We didn't even have
5268000	5269000	Whatever that Netflix
5269000	5270000	We should take it to Netflix
5270000	5271000	We didn't even
5271000	5272000	Like I didn't even dare utter it
5272000	5273000	Because there's like
5273000	5274000	There's no way
5274000	5275000	It just
5275000	5276000	It just didn't even occur to me
5276000	5277000	That that could be a possibility
5277000	5278000	Which
5278000	5279000	Like that we should take this
5279000	5280000	And sell it to Netflix
5280000	5281000	Like I didn't want to be an asshole
5281000	5282000	Unrealistic
5282000	5283000	Well where on God's earth
5283000	5284000	Did you think it would be?
5284000	5285000	I don't know
5285000	5286000	That's my point
5286000	5287000	We didn't know
5287000	5288000	God you guys
5288000	5289000	Instincts are terrible
5289000	5290000	Yeah
5290000	5291000	Do you think there would be an ABC?
5291000	5292000	It's fucking goofy
5292000	5293000	What did we
5293000	5294000	I mean what did we
5294000	5295000	I don't know
5295000	5296000	We were just being
5296000	5297000	It was really naive
5297000	5298000	I don't know
5298000	5300000	So how did you take it to Netflix?
5300000	5303000	Well the weird thing is that we actually
5303000	5305000	Because we were so not established
5305000	5306000	And then
5306000	5308000	We were working with a producer that we liked
5308000	5309000	Sean Levy
5309000	5310000	But he's a film guy
5310000	5311000	So it was basically
5311000	5312000	It was a terrible package
5312000	5314000	It was a terrible television package
5314000	5315000	And so we were like
5315000	5318000	Let's go around to studios
5318000	5320000	Not actually to networks
5320000	5321000	Which you know
5321000	5322000	They're
5322000	5323000	You know
5323000	5324000	They're the
5324000	5325000	Like for instance
5325000	5326000	A company called MRC
5326000	5327000	Helps fund
5327000	5328000	House of Cards
5328000	5329000	But they don't
5329000	5330000	You know
5330000	5331000	And then Netflix airs it
5331000	5332000	They help pay for it
5332000	5333000	So we're like
5333000	5334000	Let's get one of these people
5334000	5335000	And that'll make it a sexier package
5335000	5337000	And so we were going around doing that
5337000	5338000	And then
5338000	5339000	Mostly we were getting passes
5339000	5341000	We were getting a few interests
5341000	5342000	And then somehow Netflix
5342000	5343000	Heard about it
5343000	5345000	They were the only networker
5345000	5346000	Anything that we ever
5346000	5348000	That we pitched to the whole time
5348000	5349000	Netflix just heard about it
5349000	5350000	Well no no no
5350000	5352000	They have cameras everywhere
5352000	5353000	Yeah
5353000	5354000	And it was specifically
5354000	5355000	It was like a TV agent
5355000	5357000	Like at a breakfast
5357000	5358000	Pitching other shit
5358000	5359000	Into the Netflix executive
5359000	5360000	And him going
5360000	5361000	Oh we're looking for stuff
5361000	5362000	He was so lucky
5362000	5363000	They were like
5363000	5364000	For like young adults
5364000	5365000	We're looking for super net
5365000	5366000	We like super natural
5366000	5367000	And Eddie's films do really well
5367000	5368000	It was just
5368000	5369000	Talking about the shit
5369000	5370000	In their algorithm I think
5370000	5371000	Wow
5371000	5372000	That they were looking for
5372000	5373000	And he's like
5373000	5374000	Well I happen to have this thing
5374000	5375000	We have two studios who want it
5375000	5376000	He's like
5376000	5377000	Give it to me now over the weekend
5377000	5378000	And then it happened really fast
5378000	5379000	And I think it helped
5379000	5380000	You know how things work
5380000	5381000	Like you can't get that first bite
5381000	5383000	But then once one person is interested in it
5383000	5384000	And suddenly like
5384000	5385000	Oh it's a thing
5385000	5386000	Right
5386000	5387000	Like oh people like this
5387000	5388000	Like it's legitimate
5388000	5389000	Like it's legitimate
5389000	5390000	Because we had like
5390000	5391000	12, 15 passes
5391000	5392000	And then one person bought it
5392000	5393000	And then suddenly everyone's like
5393000	5394000	Oh my god this is amazing
5394000	5396000	It didn't change in a week
5396000	5397000	Like it's like
5397000	5398000	Someone just liked
5398000	5399000	One person
5399000	5400000	One person liked it
5400000	5402000	And then it's a snowball effect
5402000	5403000	And during that
5403000	5405000	While I was having that snowball effect
5405000	5407000	Someone at Netflix heard about it
5407000	5408000	So what
5408000	5409000	Okay so
5409000	5411000	The immediate audience here
5411000	5412000	I don't know if it's still a thing
5412000	5413000	But everybody's going like
5413000	5415000	Okay so what do I do?
5415000	5416000	Like
5416000	5418000	And I never know how to answer that question
5418000	5419000	Well you obviously
5419000	5420000	You make something that you love
5420000	5422000	And hope it just gets out of there
5422000	5423000	At least for us
5423000	5424000	Sorry
5424000	5425000	Yeah for so long
5425000	5426000	Yeah we were
5426000	5428000	We were writing stuff that like we thought
5428000	5430000	Like we'd meet with these producers
5430000	5431000	Or what not
5431000	5432000	And they're like
5432000	5433000	This is what we're looking for
5433000	5434000	But the weird thing is
5434000	5435000	Like parental activity
5435000	5436000	You guys are directors and writers
5436000	5437000	But you did come to a point
5437000	5438000	Which is a little
5438000	5439000	Yeah
5439000	5440000	There's a
5440000	5442000	There's a way to look at this
5442000	5443000	In a disheartening way
5443000	5444000	Which is that
5444000	5446000	Because directors shoot stuff
5446000	5448000	And writers write kind of documents
5448000	5450000	Suggesting you shoot stuff later
5450000	5452000	And you guys made a decision
5452000	5454000	To pull out of the shooting of stuff
5454000	5456000	Which is that advice
5456000	5457000	Which is channel 101
5457000	5458000	Which is like
5458000	5459000	Hey man
5459000	5460000	Do what you're going to do
5460000	5461000	If you're allowed to do anything
5461000	5462000	And meh meh meh
5462000	5463000	And you guys were like
5463000	5465000	Yeah let's not make short films anymore
5465000	5466000	Let's like
5466000	5467000	Let's write scripts
5467000	5469000	And that'll be the path
5469000	5470000	I don't know
5470000	5471000	Like
5474000	5475000	Are we going to
5475000	5476000	Are we telling these kids
5476000	5478000	To go in their backyard
5478000	5479000	And shoot home movies
5479000	5480000	Or are we telling them
5480000	5481000	To run over their keyboards
5481000	5483000	I know that the simple answer is
5483000	5484000	If you want to be a writer
5484000	5485000	Run over your keyboards
5485000	5486000	But you guys are auteurs
5486000	5488000	Tell the auteurs what to do
5488000	5491000	I know I think you do both
5491000	5492000	I mean I think it's super
5492000	5493000	I mean first of all though
5493000	5494000	I never understood that advice
5494000	5495000	Of like oh go shoot
5495000	5496000	Maybe you can do it now
5496000	5497000	But there was like
5497000	5498000	Oh anyone can go make
5498000	5499000	When these filmmakers were talking
5499000	5500000	Like anyone can go make stuff now
5500000	5501000	It's so cheap
5501000	5502000	It's like no it's not
5502000	5503000	Like it's fucking expensive
5503000	5504000	That always made me mad
5504000	5505000	Like you should just go make some
5505000	5507000	It's like just to get good audio
5507000	5508000	Is expensive
5508000	5509000	Audio is the hardest thing
5509000	5510000	Like it's expensive
5510000	5511000	You know audio
5511000	5512000	And getting the lights
5512000	5513000	Pulled together
5513000	5514000	And like it ends up being
5514000	5515000	Like a big endeavor
5515000	5516000	So like always made me mad
5516000	5517000	That it's so easy now
5517000	5518000	With technology
5518000	5519000	That anyone can just go out
5519000	5520000	And make something
5520000	5521000	It's like it's not true
5521000	5522000	And if you're not into
5522000	5523000	Individual effects
5523000	5524000	Which we're not
5524000	5525000	We don't know shit about visual effects
5525000	5526000	Like it's not
5526000	5527000	You're not gonna make
5527000	5528000	There's no
5528000	5529000	There's zero chance of making something
5529000	5530000	That's gonna get you
5530000	5531000	In the door
5531000	5532000	Like that's just my feeling
5532000	5533000	I don't know there's like
5533000	5534000	There's something else in movies
5534000	5535000	That are shot on an iPhone
5535000	5536000	Or whatever
5536000	5537000	Like you can
5537000	5538000	I think that is a route
5538000	5539000	I think for
5539000	5540000	It's a hard route
5540000	5541000	That most
5541000	5542000	You know
5542000	5543000	Which is to make those films
5543000	5544000	And hope it gets
5544000	5545000	Into those festivals
5545000	5546000	In hopes that the percentage
5546000	5547000	Of that is
5547000	5548000	Is so small
5548000	5549000	So it's awesome
5549000	5550000	Doing a little bit of
5550000	5551000	Okay but even like
5551000	5552000	Tangerine is like
5552000	5553000	Over $100,000
5553000	5554000	I mean it's like
5554000	5555000	Yeah it's not cheap
5555000	5556000	It's not like
5556000	5557000	You don't have
5557000	5558000	You don't have $50
5558000	5559000	In your pocket
5559000	5560000	But I think
5560000	5561000	And what we realized
5561000	5562000	Is that
5562000	5563000	Part of this was
5563000	5564000	Because you know
5564000	5565000	When we were at Chapman
5565000	5566000	You're going around
5566000	5567000	And we're interning
5567000	5568000	At these production companies
5568000	5569000	And you're reading these scripts
5569000	5570000	Right?
5570000	5571000	And that
5571000	5572000	You know we saw
5572000	5573000	Had representation
5573000	5574000	A lot of this stuff
5574000	5575000	Was they were getting paid
5575000	5576000	To write this stuff
5576000	5577000	And it's not very
5577000	5578000	A lot of it's not very good
5578000	5579000	A lot of these scripts
5579000	5580000	In Hollywood
5580000	5581000	And needs content
5581000	5583000	Everyone needs content
5583000	5584000	So it was us going
5584000	5585000	If we can teach ourselves
5585000	5586000	How to do this
5586000	5587000	Right
5587000	5588000	Then you know
5588000	5589000	I think there's at least
5589000	5590000	Like a
5590000	5591000	Will be a crack in the door
5591000	5592000	That we can get through
5592000	5593000	I do really believe
5593000	5594000	And maybe it's super nice
5594000	5595000	But I feel like if you
5595000	5596000	Because the minute
5596000	5597000	Once we wrote something
5597000	5598000	I actually deep down
5598000	5599000	Thought was actually
5599000	5600000	Okay
5600000	5601000	Like it kind of worked
5601000	5602000	It ended up
5602000	5603000	It ended up
5603000	5604000	Eventually selling
5604000	5605000	Which is like
5605000	5606000	Because I knew the other stuff
5606000	5607000	That we had written
5607000	5608000	Like I knew
5608000	5609000	I just knew
5609000	5610000	I mean I just like
5610000	5611000	If I was really really honest
5611000	5612000	With myself
5612000	5613000	I knew it wasn't
5613000	5614000	It wasn't good enough
5614000	5615000	And then when we
5615000	5616000	And we got to that place
5616000	5617000	And I thought it was good enough
5617000	5618000	It ended up selling
5618000	5619000	So I feel like
5619000	5620000	I feel like if you
5620000	5621000	If you fail enough
5621000	5622000	And you try enough
5622000	5623000	And I don't know
5623000	5624000	At least that's what worked for us
5624000	5625000	I mean we fumbled around
5625000	5626000	For so long
5626000	5627000	So we're saying that
5627000	5629000	The internet has become such a glut
5629000	5631000	That actually truly
5631000	5635000	And I'm not going to agree with this yet
5635000	5637000	But what's on the table
5637000	5638000	Is the idea that
5638000	5640000	Whereas in 19
5640000	5642000	Or well 2002
5642000	5644000	When I was spouting it the most
5644000	5647000	Like you know
5647000	5649000	You want to make a TV show
5649000	5651000	You have a camera in your pocket
5651000	5652000	Grab it
5652000	5653000	Fuck the audio
5653000	5654000	Make the TV show
5654000	5655000	Put it online
5655000	5656000	Keep doing it
5656000	5657000	Keep doing it
5657000	5658000	Talent will out
5658000	5660000	That we've actually hit a point
5660000	5662000	Maybe the theory would be
5662000	5664000	We've hit a point where it's like
5664000	5666000	There's too much shit
5666000	5668000	And the internet is oxygen
5668000	5670000	It is just the air around us
5670000	5674000	And it's no more shocking
5674000	5676000	That anybody in this room is
5676000	5679000	Knows how to make a video
5679000	5680000	About two people
5680000	5683000	Farting and flying the flying saucer
5683000	5684000	Than it is
5685000	5687000	It doesn't matter
5687000	5688000	There's too much shit to click on
5688000	5690000	And everyone's got too much shit going on
5692000	5694000	So we focus on script as a document
5694000	5697000	Because it's sort of like part of the old world
5697000	5699000	And we write up our idea
5699000	5701000	Of like fade in on this
5701000	5702000	And cut to that
5702000	5704000	And this is our idea
5704000	5707000	Is that because the agency mechanism
5707000	5708000	Is still in control
5708000	5709000	That it's still
5709000	5711000	I think that can
5711000	5713000	I think people are doing that
5713000	5714000	Where they're making that stuff
5714000	5715000	And it's cutting through
5715000	5717000	I just think it's so percentage wise
5717000	5719000	It's got to be pretty well
5719000	5720000	I mean because like you said
5720000	5722000	There's just so much shit
5722000	5723000	I don't know what's going on on YouTube
5723000	5725000	I don't understand some of the stuff
5725000	5727000	No because I'm not even on Twitter
5727000	5729000	But I was searching Twitter
5729000	5731000	To see what people are saying about the show
5731000	5732000	And you know you click on these people
5732000	5734000	And you've got like 10 million followers
5734000	5737000	And I was like I don't know who this YouTube star is
5737000	5739000	So I feel like I'm talking about this
5739000	5740000	We shouldn't be talking about it
5740000	5741000	I don't know
5741000	5742000	Yeah I don't know
5742000	5743000	That's a good point
5743000	5744000	Yeah maybe
5744000	5745000	Yeah okay
5745000	5746000	Yeah we shouldn't be talking about it
5746000	5747000	I think the world agrees
5747000	5748000	Yeah let's all
5748000	5749000	Let's all stop talking about it
5749000	5750000	Let's talk about race
5750000	5751000	I think that
5751000	5752000	Alright
5752000	5757000	If your eyes can really pop up
5757000	5759000	That was craziness
5759000	5760000	Well how many episodes are you doing?
5760000	5761000	Season two
5761000	5762000	Nine
5762000	5763000	Oh okay
5763000	5764000	Which is weird
5764000	5766000	But it's a little warning shot
5766000	5767000	What's a warning shot?
5767000	5768000	Is it one less than the first season?
5768000	5769000	Well no one more
5769000	5770000	Oh okay
5770000	5771000	It's a little gummy bear
5771000	5772000	Yeah it's a little
5772000	5774000	It's filled with night quell
5774000	5775000	Yeah
5775000	5777000	I don't know
5777000	5779000	It's a weird time to be doing this
5779000	5781000	Because it's one of the first times
5781000	5782000	That I can think of that
5782000	5784000	You can come up with an idea
5784000	5785000	And you can go
5785000	5786000	Well this is
5786000	5788000	You know this is how long this story is
5788000	5791000	It's five hours and 30 minutes and 20 seconds
5791000	5792000	And that's just how it is
5792000	5794000	And you can actually
5794000	5795000	You can actually put that out
5795000	5796000	And I don't know
5796000	5798000	I can't think of another instance
5798000	5800000	I mean usually you're writing to commercials
5800000	5801000	Or you're writing to
5801000	5802000	You know
5802000	5803000	You know
5803000	5804000	Why are movies two hours?
5804000	5805000	You know
5805000	5806000	Is it like because you have to pee?
5806000	5807000	I'm still trying to adjust to all this
5807000	5808000	Because I
5808000	5809000	Yeah I just can't
5809000	5810000	Well yes
5810000	5812000	It's based on some kind of thing
5812000	5814000	And that's the same with the 22 minutes
5814000	5815000	The 45 minutes
5815000	5816000	I'm
5816000	5818000	I'm raised in front of Cheers
5818000	5819000	Watching TV
5819000	5822000	And so I come up in the 21st century
5822000	5823000	And I'm like this craftsman
5823000	5824000	And I'm gonna
5824000	5825000	I'm like
5825000	5826000	Like oh
5826000	5828000	This other show is shittier than mine
5828000	5830000	Because it's doing serialized storytelling
5830000	5833000	And that's a cheap tactic
5833000	5836000	And now I'm in this world where it's like
5836000	5837000	Hey old man
5837000	5839000	Like this isn't serialized
5839000	5840000	Hello
5840000	5841000	And I'm like
5841000	5842000	Oh sorry
5842000	5845000	I'll try to serialize it for you
5845000	5846000	But
5846000	5848000	And I try to like shake it
5848000	5849000	I'm like
5849000	5850000	It's sad
5850000	5852000	It just reminds me of like
5852000	5854000	The SNL sketch where
5854000	5856000	Dana Carvey was playing Johnny Carson
5856000	5858000	In a post Arsenio world
5858000	5860000	Who had had his fingers elongated
5860000	5862000	Because Arsenio has long fingers
5862000	5863000	So it was called Carsenio
5863000	5864000	And it was
5864000	5866000	Dana Carvey doing Arsenio
5866000	5867000	As
5867000	5868000	Johnny Carson
5868000	5869000	And going like
5869000	5871000	Ugh wolf wolf wolf wolf
5871000	5873000	That's how I feel when I think about
5873000	5875000	Serializing something that I'm writing
5875000	5877000	Like oh this is gonna be binge worthy
5877000	5878000	And all this stuff
5878000	5879000	It's like wait
5879000	5880000	I feel like I'm purposely
5880000	5882000	I can't tell
5882000	5883000	When I'm stooping
5883000	5885000	When I'm evolving
5885000	5887000	And when I should just retire
5887000	5888000	And like
5888000	5889000	It's like well
5889000	5890000	If
5890000	5892000	That serialization thing is like
5892000	5894000	A big fucking weird mind fuck for me
5894000	5895000	Yeah
5895000	5897000	Yeah but that's cause you're growing
5897000	5898000	I mean cause we just
5898000	5899000	We're different cause we grew up on
5899000	5900000	And I didn't grow up on
5900000	5902000	Watching much TV to be honest
5902000	5903000	So we grew up on
5903000	5904000	Movies and
5904000	5905000	And movie structures
5905000	5906000	So that's kind of what
5906000	5908000	I think that's what drew us to it
5908000	5910000	And also because the movie industry is so sad
5910000	5911000	Like we try to get into the movies
5911000	5912000	And it was just
5912000	5914000	You know it's a little depressing right now
5914000	5915000	And there was so much
5915000	5916000	In TV
5916000	5918000	And whenever we went to TV meetings
5918000	5919000	Or even not
5919000	5920000	Just with producers who
5920000	5921000	Did movies and TV
5921000	5922000	They're like well what are your TV ideas
5922000	5923000	What are your TV ideas
5923000	5924000	Cause they need content
5924000	5925000	So desperately
5925000	5926000	That's what actually led us to move to that
5926000	5927000	Are you guys just taking a movie
5927000	5928000	And breaking it up into
5928000	5929000	Yeah we're just like
5929000	5930000	Yeah that's basically what we're doing
5930000	5931000	I mean is that why the guy goes
5931000	5933000	The cop guy goes to the lab
5933000	5934000	And then he's like
5934000	5935000	Oh man there's a lab here
5935000	5936000	And then they like
5936000	5937000	Knock him out
5937000	5938000	And then he wakes up
5938000	5939000	And he's like
5939000	5940000	Back to being a cop
5940000	5941000	Is it
5941000	5942000	You're putting yourself
5942000	5943000	Into a hole
5943000	5944000	Well that's what I mean
5944000	5945000	Kind of
5945000	5946000	He's like
5946000	5947000	Well you can't go forward
5947000	5948000	With that or the movie
5948000	5949000	No
5949000	5950000	It's done
5950000	5951000	It's done
5951000	5952000	Yeah
5952000	5953000	Really it's almost like
5953000	5954000	It's like four
5954000	5955000	I mean it's eight hours
5955000	5956000	It's like a Lord of the Rings
5956000	5957000	When I was like
5957000	5958000	Lord of the Rings
5958000	5959000	Great
5959000	5960000	One book
5960000	5961000	One movie
5961000	5962000	Three awesome
5962000	5963000	Eleven years of our lives
5963000	5964000	And then they're like
5964000	5965000	Now let's do the Hobbit
5965000	5966000	I'm like what
5966000	5968000	As three movies
5968000	5970000	So one of your movies
5970000	5971000	Is gonna be about
5971000	5972000	Riding barrels
5972000	5973000	Like for sure
5973000	5974000	And sure enough
5974000	5975000	It was like
5975000	5978000	Let's ride these barrels
5978000	5979000	And they're like
5979000	5980000	Watch out
5980000	5981000	It's the barrel wizard
5981000	5982000	What?
5982000	5983000	I'm the barrel wizard
5983000	5984000	Would you like to keep
5984000	5990000	Riding the barrels?
5990000	5992000	But yeah
5992000	5993000	Okay so
5993000	5994000	Well at the outset
5994000	5995000	Of season two
5995000	5996000	Do you guys
5996000	5998000	Do you guys
5998000	5999000	Did you
6000000	6001000	Did you do a whole
6001000	6003000	Like okay here's what's gonna happen
6003000	6004000	From beginning, middle, end
6004000	6005000	In the whole season
6005000	6006000	And then you chopped it up
6006000	6007000	Like a little pie
6007000	6008000	Yeah yeah
6008000	6009000	Essentially
6009000	6010000	Yeah I mean
6010000	6011000	But obviously
6011000	6012000	It just keeps evolving
6012000	6013000	And changing as you're going
6013000	6014000	Because once you get in there
6014000	6015000	I mean what we found at least
6015000	6017000	Is I can't force these characters
6017000	6018000	To do something
6018000	6019000	So sometimes we're trying
6019000	6020000	To force someone to go
6020000	6021000	In a direction
6021000	6022000	And it's like well
6022000	6023000	They just don't wanna do that
6023000	6024000	That feels stupid
6024000	6026000	And so then it just keeps
6026000	6027000	Changing and evolving
6027000	6028000	But if we know
6028000	6031000	Where we're going eventually
6031000	6032000	That's the goal
6032000	6033000	And the same thing
6033000	6034000	With season two
6034000	6035000	It just keeps
6035000	6036000	It keeps evolving
6036000	6037000	But we know
6037000	6038000	Where we know
6038000	6039000	What that destination is
6039000	6040000	Can I pitch you guys something?
6040000	6041000	Yeah sure
6041000	6042000	You probably
6042000	6043000	You probably don't like
6043000	6044000	When this happens
6044000	6045000	But it's not like
6045000	6046000	I'm a waiter
6046000	6047000	I made community
6053000	6054000	And I know you don't want
6054000	6055000	To be pigeonholed
6055000	6056000	As the eighties guys
6056000	6057000	But you know
6057000	6058000	Encyclopedia Brown
6058000	6059000	Yeah
6059000	6061000	Because I just wanna make
6061000	6062000	Encyclopedia Brown
6062000	6063000	But like Chinatown
6063000	6064000	Like
6064000	6065000	Like
6065000	6067000	Like he's the smartest kid
6067000	6068000	On the block
6068000	6070000	Which means he has Asperger's
6070000	6071000	And he's like
6071000	6073000	It's hard for him to deal with people
6073000	6074000	But he can solve crimes
6074000	6075000	But it's hardcore
6075000	6076000	So it's like
6076000	6078000	He's like a kid detective

6106000	6107000	And so
6107000	6108000	And so like
6108000	6109000	A grown up comes in
6109000	6110000	Like Michael Madsen
6110000	6111000	Comes into the garage
6111000	6112000	And then this

6130000	6131000	Like it's a
6131000	6132000	But it's based on that
6132000	6133000	We'll erase the part
6133000	6134000	Where I legally left a paper child
6134000	6135000	But like
6135000	6136000	But he's like
6136000	6138000	He's Encyclopedia Brown
6138000	6139000	And and and
6139000	6140000	And so it's like
6140000	6141000	Okay
6141000	6142000	Mystery of the missing grapes
6142000	6143000	I got it
6143000	6144000	Well the grapes were here

6149000	6152000	Here's your three carrots
6152000	6153000	But then he like
6153000	6154000	Gets a grown up job
6154000	6155000	And it's like
6155000	6156000	Clearly
6156000	6157000	You know
6157000	6158000	As in
6158000	6159000	He shows up
6159000	6160000	And there's a fucking dead body
6160000	6161000	Like he's supposed to just
6161000	6162000	Go somewhere
6162000	6163000	And like
6163000	6164000	Oh I
6164000	6165000	I think there's a bike
6165000	6166000	And I want you to get it back
6166000	6167000	But it's like a grown up
6167000	6168000	And he's like
6168000	6169000	I need a kid
6169000	6170000	A kid can get in a doggy door
6170000	6171000	Whatever his thing is
6171000	6172000	But it's clearly
6172000	6173000	He's been set up
6173000	6174000	And he's like
6174000	6175000	He's supposed to witness the
6175000	6176000	He's
6176000	6177000	He's like
6177000	6178000	He's being used
6178000	6179000	And he's been
6179000	6180000	He's been fucking set up
6180000	6181000	That's the threshold you cross
6181000	6184000	Someone just fucked with Encyclopedia Brown
6184000	6187000	Like and he's like
6187000	6188000	Fuck this
6188000	6189000	And he has this like
6189000	6190000	Voiceover
6190000	6191000	Like I've
6191000	6192000	I've always wanted to write something with voiceover
6192000	6193000	Like but I
6193000	6194000	There's
6194000	6195000	It's like I always hate it
6195000	6196000	But it's like
6196000	6197000	I'll do it
6197000	6198000	You guys direct it
6198000	6199000	Where he's like
6199000	6200000	Just like
6200000	6201000	He's like
6201000	6202000	Fucking somebody fucked with me today
6202000	6203000	I had a deal with society
6203000	6204000	And it's like
6204000	6205000	I'd be smart
6205000	6206000	And keep my head down
6206000	6207000	And help them solve their fucking mysteries
6207000	6208000	And they wouldn't fuck with me
6208000	6209000	But they just
6209000	6210000	And they wouldn't use the F word this much
6210000	6211000	It's not a David Mamet play
6211000	6212000	But they
6212000	6213000	I'm just saying like
6213000	6214000	He's
6214000	6215000	He's
6215000	6216000	The outrage
6216000	6217000	He's like
6217000	6218000	Uncorked
6218000	6219000	He's like
6219000	6220000	He's like a super genius
6220000	6221000	And it hurts to be this smart
6221000	6222000	And he lost his parents
6222000	6223000	It's like
6223000	6224000	Do you ever see Zero Effect with Bill Pullman?
6224000	6225000	It's like
6225000	6226000	It's like that
6226000	6227000	But a kid
6227000	6228000	He's fucking mentally unhinged
6228000	6230000	That's why he's so good at solving crimes
6230000	6231000	It's like
6232000	6233000	He's like
6233000	6234000	He's fucking like
6234000	6235000	He's kind of twitchy
6235000	6236000	And there is like
6236000	6237000	A girl like
6237000	6238000	What was her name?
6238000	6239000	Like Kimball
6239000	6240000	Or whatever
6240000	6241000	Kimball
6241000	6242000	There was a girl in Encyclopedia Brown
6242000	6243000	Who was like
6243000	6244000	The muscle
6244000	6245000	But was like
6245000	6246000	Also like
6246000	6247000	His
6247000	6248000	His like
6248000	6249000	Watson
6249000	6250000	But she was kind of
6250000	6251000	Like she also was bigger
6251000	6252000	Because girls mature faster
6252000	6253000	So she could beat up Bugs Meany
6253000	6254000	Anyways
6254000	6255000	But he's
6255000	6256000	Yeah
6256000	6257000	So there's like
6257000	6258000	A little love story to it
6258000	6259000	But it's like
6259000	6260000	But I'm just saying
6260000	6261000	Deep and dark
6261000	6262000	Like Chinatown
6262000	6263000	Like
6263000	6264000	Like
6264000	6265000	Chinatown dark
6265000	6266000	But with a kid
6266000	6267000	And he's like
6267000	6269000	He's been sucked into a grown up world of murder
6269000	6271000	And they're trying to play him
6271000	6272000	And he's like
6272000	6273000	I've played this fucking role
6273000	6274000	And like
6274000	6275000	Now I'm
6275000	6276000	Like now I gotta use my own like
6276000	6277000	Detective skills to like
6277000	6278000	Play with these grown ups
6278000	6279000	And it's like
6279000	6280000	Badass
6280000	6281000	Yeah
6281000	6282000	And it can be set in the 80s or not
6282000	6283000	But you guys will probably be like
6283000	6284000	We can't
6284000	6285000	Cause we don't be the 80s guys
6285000	6286000	And I'll be like
6286000	6287000	Fine
6287000	6288000	We'll do it like
6288000	6289000	It follows
6289000	6290000	Where like
6290000	6291000	It's kind of
6291000	6292000	Sort of
6292000	6293000	Feels like the 80s
6293000	6294000	But then someone's got like
6294000	6295000	A DVR or something
6295000	6296000	Yeah
6296000	6297000	And you guys can be like
6297000	6298000	We're growing
6298000	6299000	And I'll be like
6299000	6300000	I
6300000	6306000	So like you guys are into it
6306000	6307000	We'll go
6307000	6308000	Yeah we'll go
6308000	6309000	We'll go to Netflix
6309000	6310000	Cause every time I go there
6310000	6311000	I'm like buzzing
6311000	6312000	And I'm like
6312000	6313000	It's Dan Harmon
6313000	6314000	Community
6314000	6315000	And they're like
6315000	6316000	I
6316000	6317000	What?
6317000	6318000	And I
6318000	6319000	Yeah so
6319000	6321000	If I figure if I win it with you guys
6321000	6324000	Or you guys go in with that idea
6324000	6325000	Have someone else write it
6325000	6329000	Encyclopedia brown but there's like
6329000	6332000	Yeah there's a fucking pool of crusted blood
6332000	6333000	On a carpet
6333000	6337000	On page 17
6337000	6338000	And then it goes
6338000	6339000	Boo boo boo boo
6339000	6340000	Boo boo boo boo
6340000	6341000	Boo boo boo boo
6341000	6344000	It says Encyclopedia brown
6344000	6345000	But for reals
6346000	6347000	In red neon
6349000	6352000	With a like serif laden neon font
6352000	6353000	Now you're into it
6353000	6354000	Yeah that's good
6354000	6355000	I see it
6355000	6356000	I get it
6358000	6359000	Did you guys like Lock Out
6359000	6360000	That space movie
6360000	6361000	It was like Die Hard in Space
6362000	6363000	Oh the one that
6363000	6364000	Yeah
6364000	6365000	That ripped off
6365000	6366000	I guess it ripped off
6366000	6367000	This game from New York
6367000	6368000	They sued them
6368000	6369000	I don't know
6369000	6370000	They won that
6370000	6371000	Yeah
6371000	6372000	He won
6372000	6373000	I know but that's kind of weird to me
6373000	6374000	Like I
6374000	6375000	I didn't know
6375000	6376000	If you could sue for that
6376000	6378000	Like I'd be in big trouble
6378000	6379000	Like I felt
6379000	6381000	Like Zemeck is going to be calling
6381000	6383000	I was talking like a Q&A with him
6383000	6384000	And they were talking to John Carpenter
6384000	6385000	And he had someone who were like
6385000	6386000	What do you think about these
6386000	6388000	You know all these remakes of your movies
6388000	6389000	He's like
6389000	6390000	He loves them
6390000	6391000	Because he gets paid
6391000	6392000	Like
6392000	6393000	Oh is he like
6393000	6394000	Yeah so with Lock Out
6394000	6395000	He's like
6395000	6396000	Fuck this
6396000	6397000	You remade him for this
6397000	6398000	Like you remade this
6398000	6399000	Pay for this
6399000	6400000	That's why he's mad
6400000	6401000	That's why he sued
6401000	6402000	I'm sure
6402000	6403000	But it's just
6403000	6404000	I didn't want to knock
6404000	6405000	His point of view
6405000	6406000	Or
6406000	6407000	I didn't see it
6407000	6408000	Did you see it?
6408000	6409000	Yeah I did
6409000	6410000	And I thought it was just
6410000	6411000	That guy pierced
6411000	6412000	I thought it was die hard in space
6412000	6413000	I didn't really think
6413000	6414000	I mean I recognized
6414000	6416000	Devices used in Escape From New York
6416000	6418000	But I didn't think that those devices were
6418000	6419000	The light bulb
6419000	6421000	I thought that they were kind of like
6421000	6422000	I don't know
6422000	6423000	I don't know
6423000	6425000	Now I feel like I'm going to get in trouble
6425000	6426000	With people I admire
6426000	6427000	So
6427000	6428000	I'll stop there
6428000	6429000	If John Carpenter said
6429000	6431000	You've just seen if you can rip off Encyclopedia Brown
6431000	6432000	Is that what this is?
6433000	6435000	There was a point where I had a meeting
6435000	6436000	There was somebody that controlled the rights
6436000	6437000	To Encyclopedia Brown
6437000	6439000	And then my agent at UCA was like
6439000	6440000	Okay you're going to meet her at the
6440000	6441000	And I was like
6441000	6443000	I came in and it was like 10am
6443000	6446000	And I ordered a vodka on the rocks
6446000	6447000	And she's like
6447000	6449000	You're drinking at 10am?
6449000	6450000	Why?
6450000	6451000	And I said
6451000	6452000	Because I'm amazing
6453000	6454000	And then they never
6454000	6455000	I was like
6455000	6456000	And then I pitched him a great take
6456000	6457000	On Encyclopedia Brown
6457000	6458000	With the blood
6458000	6459000	And the
6459000	6461000	They never called Peck
6462000	6463000	That's where
6463000	6464000	I think
6464000	6466000	I think Bugs Meany is behind it
6466000	6468000	I think we can solve it
6470000	6471000	Hey how are you?
6471000	6472000	Hi
6472000	6474000	I don't know that much about the 80s
6474000	6475000	No
6475000	6476000	Well yeah you do
6476000	6478000	It's when you
6478000	6480000	I stopped watching everything in the 80s
6480000	6482000	I got out of my parents' house
6482000	6484000	And I just started fucking
6484000	6485000	So did you think
6485000	6488000	When the Goonies and E.T. and everything was happening
6488000	6489000	Were you like
6489000	6490000	This is a Golden Age of Cinema
6490000	6491000	Or were you like
6491000	6492000	These kids are dumb
6492000	6493000	Dumb
6494000	6495000	All right
6495000	6496000	All right
6496000	6497000	Two sides to every story
6499000	6500000	Well Duffer Brothers
6500000	6502000	Are you plugging anything?
6507000	6508000	Skulljuice
6508000	6509000	Skulljuice
6509000	6510000	Say Skulljuice
6510000	6511000	Skulljuice is coming out
6511000	6512000	Oh did we
6512000	6513000	Do we need to talk about meandis
6513000	6514000	Or pogo sticks or anything?
6514000	6515000	No we do not
6515000	6517000	Did meandis drop us?
6517000	6518000	No no
6518000	6519000	It's all fine
6520000	6522000	Did everyone hear their skills though?
6522000	6525000	An advertised reading if we wanted to
6525000	6527000	Because I don't want to threaten meandis if the relationship is good
6527000	6529000	But I do want to point out that
6529000	6532000	I mean they may think they have us by the short periods
6532000	6535000	But their product could be so easily pooped in
6537000	6539000	You could just shit your pants on stage
6539000	6543000	Our whole commercial in New York was about people shitting their pants
6543000	6545000	During the meandis commercial
6545000	6546000	And they loved it
6546000	6548000	Well thank god it's a great product
6548000	6550000	You're 20 minute commercial or whatever
6550000	6552000	Was the best thing I ever heard
6552000	6553000	Wow thanks
6553000	6555000	I'm not just saying that because we're friends
6555000	6556000	Because I kind of
6556000	6557000	You know
6557000	6558000	Because we're friends I kind of hate you
6558000	6560000	No you don't like a lot about me
6560000	6561000	Yeah
6564000	6566000	All right well I should probably do a rap
6566000	6567000	Yeah
6572000	6573000	But like
6575000	6576000	Well like a sitting down rap
6577000	6578000	Oh shit
6578000	6580000	This isn't the return of sit down rapper is it?
6582000	6583000	Don't remember him
6586000	6587000	Or that thing
6588000	6590000	He didn't care about your needs
6590000	6591000	Yo
6591000	6592000	Yo
6592000	6593000	Yo

6615000	6616000	South
6616000	6617000	Fuck your mama in the head
6617000	6618000	In the mouth
6618000	6619000	I fuck your mama all
6619000	6620000	Up live one day
6620000	6622000	I fuck your mama because my name is
6622000	6623000	Shay
6625000	6626000	Shay Johnson
6631000	6632000	A new character
6633000	6634000	My name is Shay Johnson
6634000	6635000	I live on 3rd street
6635000	6636000	I like to go to the haircut
6637000	6638000	In 8th street
6638000	6640000	I like to get my hairs cut on the side
6640000	6641000	And on the top
6641000	6642000	And then I take them for a ride
6642000	6643000	Say
6643000	6644000	Lo
6644000	6645000	Look how much short my hair's got
6645000	6646000	And the women say
6646000	6647000	Oh man
6647000	6648000	Look what you got
6648000	6649000	And then I say
6649000	6650000	You wanna smoke some pot
6650000	6651000	And they come back to my house
6651000	6652000	And I say
6652000	6653000	My soul's rotten
6653000	6655000	Cause I'm a depressed rapper
6656000	6658000	From the new era of hip-hopper
6659000	6661000	I'm gonna kill myself with my lyrical madness
6661000	6663000	And who are you when you haunted me
6663000	6665000	I don't know why you don't call me
6665000	6667000	I don't know why everybody got a problem with me
6667000	6669000	I'm just a depressed rapper
6669000	6670000	I'm so depressed
6670000	6671000	God hates me
6671000	6673000	I'm so depressed
6674000	6676000	I'm a depressed rapper
6677000	6679000	With an auto-tune effect
6680000	6683000	I'm a depressed rapper
6684000	6687000	Like all the rappers are
6688000	6690000	You don't hear anybody using this effect
6690000	6692000	To say something cool like
6692000	6695000	Hey, I had a great day today
6696000	6698000	I really felt like I had a win
6698000	6699000	I had an audition
6699000	6701000	And I feel like I'm in the system
6701000	6703000	No, I'm gonna wish them well
6704000	6706000	I'm gonna go down to New Ileans
6706000	6707000	And help them stack sandbags
6707000	6708000	You know what I mean?
6708000	6710000	To save their lives from the thick coming flood
6710000	6712000	I'm gonna donate my money
6712000	6713000	And donate my blood
6713000	6715000	Because I know that people need help
6715000	6717000	And I'm gonna go to the restaurant
6717000	6719000	With a good Yelp score
6719000	6721000	Cause I want deconstructed
6721000	6724000	Lasagna and some more
6725000	6727000	Full soup
6727000	6730000	Because I'm a rapper
6730000	6733000	And I've got a lot of positive things to say
6734000	6735000	It goes like this
6735000	6736000	I wanna kill myself
6736000	6739000	Why don't you kill me for fucking you on the shelf
6739000	6742000	I need to get paid to fuck you
6742000	6744000	Or I'm gonna kill myself
6745000	6748000	Why do your face make me feel like I can't feel my face
6748000	6750000	I'm gonna go to hell when I die
6750000	6751000	Cause I've got problems
6751000	6753000	I've got, oh my god
6753000	6755000	I feel so bad about myself
6755000	6756000	I feel bad
6756000	6758000	I feel bad about myself
6758000	6761000	But the duffer brother's in the house
6761000	6762000	I fucked your mother
6762000	6765000	Tell that pussy got tired as a mouse
6766000	6770000	Your mama's pussy stole some cheese from me
6770000	6772000	And I ran after it like a cat
6772000	6774000	And it tried to fool me
6774000	6777000	Your mama's pussy ran into a hole
6777000	6779000	I reached my hand into it
6779000	6781000	And put a string of dynamite in my hand
6781000	6783000	Dressed like a mouse
6783000	6786000	The dynamite was dressed like a mouse
6786000	6791000	The dynamite was dressed like a mouse
6792000	6794000	You're all, take it away
6794000	6796000	You're all, I'm a seed dynamite mouse
6796000	6798000	I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
6799000	6800000	Now don't take it
6801000	6803000	For real, you made me come here
6803000	6805000	Yeah, it was a, it was an impulsive thought
6805000	6808000	You told me to come all the way over here and rap
6808000	6810000	I changed my mind
6810000	6812000	Don't make me get mad
6812000	6813000	Yeah, right
6814000	6815000	Fuck you
6816000	6817000	9-11
6818000	6820000	Happy 9-11
6820000	6822000	9-9-9-11
6822000	6824000	Don't forget 9-11
6825000	6827000	Yo, when those towers came down
6827000	6828000	My heart came down
6828000	6830000	My ear to crown came down
6830000	6833000	But my heart was the tallest
6833000	6835000	And now it's the ballest
6835000	6837000	Yo, I never forget
6837000	6838000	When I fuck your mama so hard
6838000	6840000	Her 9-11 gets wet
6840000	6841000	I made her pussy so wide
6841000	6843000	I flew two planes aside
6843000	6845000	And then she came and then she died
6845000	6847000	Yo, but then she went to
6847000	6848000	Oh shit, oh fuck
6848000	6850000	What the fuck is good shit?
6850000	6853000	God damn, it was like a terrorist attack
6853000	6855000	Woke a sleepy giant
