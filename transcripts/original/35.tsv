109840	110840	Guess what, everybody?
110840	111840	It's Harmon Town.
111840	112840	It's a session.
112840	137840	Won't you welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmon Town, Dan Harmon.
137840	138840	Chicago!
138840	139840	Oh.
139840	140840	All right.
140840	141840	Theatre Town, finally.
141840	142840	My people.
142840	155340	Fuck all those other cities.
155340	156840	So tired of faking it, Jeff.
156840	157840	Yeah.
157840	162080	Oh, Austin, I love it, because we're in Texas.
162080	166280	Safe to say it, because they won't hear us anymore.
167280	168280	Fuck those people.
168280	174280	I felt like I was doing mental sit-ups, you know, like pretending to be happy in all those
174280	179280	cities when Chicago is the only reason we came out.
179280	185280	Yeah, up yours, New York.
185280	189000	Who wants to perform in New York?
189000	190000	It's dumb.
190000	191000	Nobody.
191000	192000	Especially Brooklyn.
192000	195000	What an unhipped borough.
196000	200000	Anyways, Jeff, improv was invented here.
200000	201000	Is it true?
201000	202000	Yeah.
202000	207000	How many people in the crowd are improvisers or have improvised?
207000	212000	Well, get out your notepads.
212000	217440	Because historically, for the very first time, tonight's Harmon Town will be 100% pulled
217440	218440	out of my ass.
218440	220400	I am tired.
220400	222400	I'm tired of the countless rehearsals.
222400	224760	I'm tired of the effort.
225520	227520	I'm tired of going over this shit with people.
227520	229520	I am a bit of a taskmaster.
229520	235240	At 8 a.m. every day, Dan and I get up, and I make him rehearse and rehearse the show.
235240	236240	Work on your raps.
236240	237240	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
237240	238240	I know.
238240	245840	It's not, how many times do I have to tell you it's uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, not
245840	249640	uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
249640	251520	Pussy rhymes with pussy, Dan.
251520	252520	Just say it.
252520	256360	We found out last night that pussy can possibly rhyme with Gary Busey.
256360	257360	Yes.
257360	259800	If you sell it.
259800	263800	Someone in Bloomington, Indiana, like, called out, like, I said for the third time, because
263800	268320	I, you know, of course you'd be rapping about fucking people's mamas as I want to do.
268320	270560	You end up talking about her pussy.
270560	274080	If you make the mistake, Chicago, you know what I'm talking about.
274080	276600	First level workshops, this is, this is taught in.
276600	281440	If you make the mistake of ending with pussy in your first line, where are you gonna go?
281440	285560	And I, I was lamenting that on stage and, uh, someone in Bloomington, Indiana called
285560	290600	out Gary Busey and I, uh, and I, and I ended the show and I took him in the green room
290600	294920	and I said, I don't know what the fuck you're trying to pull, but if you ever want me or
294920	300680	Rob Schneider to ever come here, again, you take your fucking snotty little Midwestern
300680	304720	bullshit back to, uh, the Midwest.
304720	309600	I'm going to Chicago, which is also in the Midwest, but it's like a New York-y kind
309600	312040	of city where they invented improv.
312040	317400	And if I want to hear what rhymes with pussy, I'll, I'll find out at Second City, you little
317400	328080	piece of shit, you little fuck, Todd Jacobson, age 19, whose address is, uh, 4328, I'm reading
328080	334720	this off of a piece of paper from you in podcast land, Wilshire Boulevard, wait, there's a
334720	335720	Wilshire Boulevard.
335720	336720	It doesn't matter.
336720	337720	Uh, let's stop.
337720	339160	Let's, let's, let's, let's start over.
339920	345440	Um, Chicago, Chicago invented improv.
345440	346960	So we're going to make up the whole show tonight.
346960	353000	They invented wind, uh, so, you know, that doesn't, that doesn't really have any effect
353000	354000	on us.
354000	355000	We're indoors.
355000	361840	They, uh, the typewriter was invented here, uh, uh, uh, George Washington died here, uh,
362840	368840	Illinois, the 50th state to leave the union in the pre-civil war.
368840	373680	So there was a, there was a, a lot of people don't know this, I'm sure Chicago knows because
373680	374680	they were here.
374680	380680	Uh, they, there was a pre-civil war where the North North and the North South, uh, fought
380680	384200	to see who would attack the South first.
384200	385680	Did you know that?
385680	386680	I knew that.
386680	387680	Yeah.
387680	390900	A lot of these assholes didn't know, obviously, they're, they're not, they're, they're staring
390900	397440	at me like I'm some kind of a fat idiot who, uh, got fired from his own show, uh, uh, came
397440	402500	to Chicago to try to get people to, uh, uh, make them sign stuff so they could feel better.
402500	406380	I have an S this, Dan, you, you got two new shows, uh, that you're in, in the works.
406380	407380	No, I don't.
407380	410180	Well, you have, you have a CBS show and a Fox show.
410180	419180	I conned to giant corporations that are giving me a great deal of money and, uh, they love
419180	420180	corporations.
420540	423940	I wanted, I wanted Bob Greenblatt to know I was employable.
423940	428720	I'm sure he really keeps himself up at night going, eh, I hope I can prove him wrong by
428720	432500	firing him and then I wanted him to read in the press that I could work for two networks
432500	433500	at once.
433500	438900	Let's, let's say that I took their money and then I got in a bus and I came out here.
438900	440440	And you've been shirking your responsibilities.
440440	443460	You turned in the CBS thing, but you have not turned in the Fox thing, right?
443460	444460	I have not.
444460	448660	When was that due?
448660	452740	December-ish.
452740	458700	But you know, in my defense, like what I do isn't really a schedulable thing.
458700	464020	You don't, you don't, you don't go up to a plumber and say, uh, uh, unclog my toilet.
464020	465020	Yes you do.
465020	469380	That's, that's exactly what you say to a plumber.
469380	472260	Because there's a leak and you say, I thought my, my, my basement is floating.
472260	475260	Yeah, but he tells you I'll be there between 10 and nine.
475260	476260	Yeah.
476260	477260	And then he comes.
477260	479900	Yeah, but it's, he gives you a big wide thing and then.
479900	480900	But it's a day.
480900	481900	It does come.
481900	482900	Yeah.
482900	483900	All right.
483900	488620	So I'm like a plumber that doesn't come, but I, but I unclog more than a toilet, Jeff.
488620	496900	I unclog America's lack of entertainment and that's worth waiting a couple of extra months.
496900	497900	Thank you, Chicago.
497900	500860	I knew you'd get me.
500860	506140	Now let's say that both, both shows, uh, you know, in a, in a magical, perfect universe,
506140	508620	the CBS show, your Fox show, both get picked up.
508620	509620	That's not going to happen.
509620	510620	But let's just say, okay, okay.
510620	511620	Okay.
511620	520060	Let's just say, let's all join Jeff's weird peppermint world where gumdrops are shoes.
520060	521660	What happens there?
521660	527260	A deer licks my balls and the salt makes him strong and he gets accepted by his dear friends.
527260	529820	I don't even, why are you saying what you're saying?
529820	530820	Sorry.
530820	531820	I didn't.
531820	534540	I can't believe you're wasting this good stuff and you haven't turned in your fast script
534540	535540	yet.
536540	539100	Peppermint shoe balls.
539100	540100	What do you want to know?
540100	543640	I'm saying, I'm saying in a world where both of your shows get picked up and now you're
543640	547460	forced to be a guy that you can't do both, but let's say that you could, let's say you
547460	552580	were the showrunner and creator of both a CBS multi-camera show and a Fox single camera
552580	559740	show, which would you get fired off one or more of them?
559740	564100	I went, well, my hope, the supposition was that I wouldn't get fired from any of them
564100	570180	because remember, I also have an adult swim show coming in 2014, so the hope was that
570180	577900	by diversifying my asshole folio that I would now create a situation because at the risk
577900	583740	of sounding defensive and self-aggrandizing and possibly psychotic, a little Mansonian
583740	591220	and perhaps a little Koreshian and with just a pinch of beauty, I think as far as I can
591220	597380	tell in my crazy brain, the reason I keep getting fired is because I have too much time
597380	603180	to focus on the job and I keep going like, yeah, but what if it could be a really, really,
603180	604740	really good show?
604740	608340	And then after a while, it gets very annoying to people around me.
608340	612620	So you're saying by scattering your focus this much?
612620	615980	So here was my fantasy, okay, in your gumdrop world.
615980	621020	I wake up, okay, it's Monday, it's 9 a.m.
621020	627900	I wake up, all right, so I'm going to take the mic out so I can move around, give the
627900	630180	space work.
630180	635420	Watch this improv Olympic students.
635420	638060	It's 9 a.m.
638060	643500	What time did I get to bed last night on this clock that I'm holding up?
643500	648260	Got home at 3 and made love to my girlfriend who I'm able to maintain a relationship with
648260	653800	while running three shows because I'm able to get an erection because none of these three
653800	660300	networks are run by a Bob Greenblatt.
660300	663180	So my dick gets hard mysteriously out of nowhere.
663180	667540	I'll just be sitting around and my dick will get hard and blood is allowed to go into the
667540	672140	little valves.
672140	677940	Time to go to work in my giant car with a cow catcher on the front.
677940	688260	I don't know what, it's got diamonds on the thing and you're now entering your car.
688260	690620	It's 2014.
690620	697860	You have three new messages in your car, sorry, sorry, I'm programmed to make you feel better
697860	702100	about yourself by stumbling over words.
702100	705340	That'll do, amazing AI car.
705340	710300	Let's hear those three messages while I drive to my first, the first job.
710300	715220	First new message sent today at 8.30 a.m.
715220	720660	Hey Dan, it's your masseuse, just wanted to let you know, man, dude, it was so relaxing
720660	725100	massaging you.
725100	726100	Sent 8.47.
726100	741220	Not going to worry about it, got a cow catcher, 8.47 a.m., hey Dan, it's CBS, just calling
741220	745780	you to let you know, great job, great job on the script, great idea with the dog.
745780	752300	Alright, so getting out, third message, it's from my girlfriend, she'll understand, work
752300	753300	comes first.
753300	769420	Alright, here I am, I'm here at CBS for my first day of work, oh god, I felt so bad about
769420	776420	hitting that cow that we brought it into the writer's room and it's working for us now
776420	783420	and actually we won an Emmy.
783420	789780	We just milked it onto a piece of paper and let it dry and it was amazing, had to sweeten
789780	794100	the laughs a little bit, you know, everything needs coaxing.
794100	804300	What's going on, Gary Fucknuts, my show runner because I'm just the creator, I just fucking
804300	813380	hang out and I'm creative, amazing, got a great idea for a pitch, what if Douglass decides
813380	817140	to change the way he dresses for an episode and he wants to go basketball but he's allergic
817140	825020	to shrimp so he ends up dressing totally different and then we'll talk, thought balloon over
825020	833740	my head, that sounds like a really shitty idea, I'd kill myself before I watch that.
833740	846020	That thought balloon over my head, you keep getting fired, stop it, stop it, Gary, you're
846020	851940	promoted, I'm going to take a quick nap in my office, hey, that gives me a great idea
851940	862140	for an episode, hey, what if his voice trails off, what if so and so took a nap in his office?
862140	871300	Open the window in my office, climb out, Natalie, AI car, pulling up to your predetermined
871300	880420	escape route, take me to Fox, Natalie, hey, play that third message, I heard, play turd
880420	885020	massage, god damn it, it's a fucking technology, that's the most stressful thing that'll happen
885020	893720	to me all day, play the third message, hey, it's Erin McGathey, I published another random
893720	906420	collection of your babblings and it made a million dollars, hey, get yourself a dildo,
906420	917500	now arriving at Fox Studios, hey, hey, whoa, do you hear the news, Golden Globe, yoy, yoy,
917500	924180	yeah, dude, I was just over at my CBS job, those fucking assholes, they think they're
924180	930740	making a good TV show just because it's eight times as many people watch it, we're making
930740	939500	art over here, right? Because only 17 million people are watching, so what do you got? Well,
939500	946460	we have this idea that Spookless would want to dress differently, but then he'd dress
946460	951820	differently and because he's allergic to squid, that then he would say, but then he'd stop
951820	956460	because I remember that Abed character and he would look at the camera and he'd go, what
956460	962780	am I doing, what am I, Douglass from CBS, you're amazing, that's great, it's a little
962780	968340	meta, it's still Fox, it's got an edge, I like it, I'm gonna go in my office to take a nap,
968340	972340	hey, you gave me a great idea, what if he said he was taking a nap but he knew he was
972340	983580	taking a nap, shh, Bessie, just go in there and punch up the scrap,
983580	994980	Natalie, bring the cow catcher mobile around, take me to adult swim, wait, stop on third and
994980	1007260	dope dealer street, hey, Mike, hey, Mr. Harmon, whoa, whoa, whoa, Mike, what race are you? I'm an
1007260	1015620	Eskimo, Mr. Harmon, just checking, just checking and clarifying, you sounded a little sky cappy
1015620	1025020	there, now make with the drugs and the blubber, thank you, because I'm going to adult swim where
1025020	1033540	30 people are gonna watch, but it's all about fucking excitement, hey, everybody, hey, it's me,
1033540	1037100	your friends, whoa, we're all your friends, we don't know what the fuck we're doing, but we're
1037100	1041940	your friends, whoa, whoa, whoa, what do you got for me? We don't have shit, we don't know what to do
1041940	1046620	when you're not here, we're your friends, the fuck's happening, we just got high the whole time, we're
1046620	1051420	gone, we're really freaking out, hey guys, take it easy, what if we did an episode about people
1051420	1056340	freaking out, drawing a circle on the board, look, look where we are, we're freaking out,
1056340	1062300	cosmic threshold, goddess, who's so fucking genius, please give me a job every time, holy shit,
1062500	1067500	I can't believe it, I'm so fucking high, I'm freaking out, it's fucking great, man, fading,
1067500	1071860	I'm freaking out, hey, you got a phone call from the president of Adult Swim, hey, Lazo, how's it
1071860	1076860	going? Hey, man, I just want to let you know I'm so fucking high, I love this fucking show, man,
1076860	1081380	I love everything on Adult Swim, I don't give a shit, nobody's watching, I don't give a fuck,
1081380	1087420	I'm fucking, I'm high, I got a fucking pickle in my ear, I got an antenna on my head, I'm in Atlanta,
1087420	1091660	I don't have any political reason to fuck around with anybody, I'm just having a great life,
1092140	1097660	living my dreams, it's fucking great, television's for fun, hey, you weren't speaking for the whole
1097660	1102220	time, we were rubbing our dicks for fun, I love that, I love that, we didn't mean to do it,
1102220	1105140	we weren't doing it out of disrespect, we just love rubbing our dicks and stuff, we're so high,
1105140	1113180	all right, all right guys, whoa, what time is it, 3 p.m., I better go home, that was my fantasy.
1121740	1132860	So here was the reality, really, it was, hey, can I have a bazillion dollars to write a show, yeah,
1132860	1137820	we're really excited because we really respect you here at Fox, and yeah, we really respect you here
1137820	1144700	at CBS too, we'll slow down Fox at CBS, I can only write one show for one network, right, I just
1144700	1147820	guess I should go with Fox because I'll probably fuck up more at CBS because, you know, tastes are
1147900	1154220	so different, all right Fox, I'll take a bunch of money from you, all right, CBS, okay, sorry,
1154220	1160700	I said yes to Fox, yeah, but you can write one for us too, I can, Jesus Christ, that's really
1160700	1165740	gonna piss Bob Greenblatt off, I think, in my weird dumb mind, like he ever thinks about me,
1167020	1171660	okay, thank you, thank you for all the money guys, when are you gonna be done with the script, dude,
1171660	1176380	I'm so fast, I'm fucking crazy, it only took me a week to write a community episode because it had
1176460	1183180	to be done in a week and I had 20 people helping me, as far as I can remember, I'm a really fast
1183180	1189980	writer, I can't remember past two and a half years because I'm always high, I'm a really fast writer,
1189980	1195340	okay, I'll give you guys a script, I'll have to be done before Christmas because after Christmas I
1195340	1200460	only have a week to prepare for going on a tour where I go and masturbate to audiences and do
1200460	1204220	shit like this that inevitably gets me fired because when they hear it they're gonna be mad
1204220	1207740	because it sounds disrespectful, okay, all right, but it won't matter because I'll have turned in
1207740	1216300	these great scripts, so who cares, okay, bye, bon voyage, we love you, let's see, just unbutton
1216300	1227820	my pants, put on the internet, 30 days later, almost finished, oh, still coming, no, I didn't
1227900	1238220	know I was into that, oh, oh, oh, it burns, oh, oh, oh, the creative process, it shapes and it
1238220	1245020	burns, I had to come up with new ways to get hard, oh, oh, every drop, all right, 12 hours left,
1245020	1252060	let's start on that CBS thing, time to go to Europe, oops, okay, well, hey, CBS, hey man,
1252060	1256380	fucking genius, you're amazing, we love you, we're very supportive of you, we're good people, we make
1256460	1260540	good television, just want to check in with you, guys, it's almost done, what the fuck?
1264220	1267900	CBS, Dan just made a jerk-off motion if you're listening on the podcast,
1269900	1274380	suck his tongue out, I made a jerk-off thing, a bit of a snag, I'll have to write it on the plane,
1275900	1282460	I mean, fuck it, you know, altitude gets me high, it also gets me horny, I'm gonna go in the bathroom
1282460	1289340	with the airplane, 12 hours later, oh, international flight, I can't come anymore, oh, I'm coming so
1289340	1299020	hard, now landing in London, hey, good night, mate, welcome to, that's where the flight took so long,
1299020	1304140	yeah, you got rerouted to Brisbane, go back, you got 28 hours to write your screenplay now,
1304140	1310700	you landed in Brisbane, okay, I'm jerking off tomorrow, oh, oh, I didn't know
1310700	1316460	Matthew McConaughey was in this many movies, I'm gonna watch all of them, now arriving in London,
1320460	1328380	Dan, Dan, it's Christmas time, we agreed to spend this time at Christmas with Rob and Kate,
1328380	1333020	we were gonna go eat Christmas dinner in London, do you understand what it's like to be a genius?
1334220	1339500	Do you understand how fucking creative I am? Why can't you be a better girlfriend?
1340700	1346620	What the fuck, you think I wanted to be behind deadline? Merry Christmas to me,
1348860	1355260	go have fun, go eat your figgy pudding, I'm gonna be here trying to write this script, okay, all
1355260	1359580	right, fine, we'll try to make our own fun in London, Jesus Christ, you're gonna fucking fade
1359580	1369020	in on me jerking off, oh, oh, they have the internet in London too, oh, oh, it's just, it's just clear
1369020	1379980	what's coming out, I had to use a coat hanger, I don't know, I don't know what it means either,
1379980	1385820	you guys reacted like you do know what it means, there must be a way to jerk off with a coat hanger,
1386780	1391660	did you get yourself pregnant and had a weird, I don't know, I don't know, but there was a Chicago
1391660	1398540	reaction a bit, I think it just might be a vulsion, a revulsion rather, a gross, I could have said
1398540	1402540	fire hydrant, maybe they would have reacted that way, I think they would have gone, huh, I said
1402540	1410540	coat hanger and they were like, whoa, not the number 52, Chicago style, whoa, deep dish jerking
1410540	1417020	off with a coat hanger, it's the secrets in the water, we ship it in from New York, all right,
1417020	1421660	so yeah, whatever, you just react for the sake of it, it doesn't matter,
1424860	1429900	so skip the Christmas vacation, I ruined Christmas because I'm like, look, I got,
1429900	1433980	guys, I would have loved to not take it, I got two scripts to write, I got two scripts to write,
1433980	1439660	uh, get back home, uh, okay, I'll just finish them up right before we go on this tour,
1443260	1445420	okay, we're going on tour, all right, I'll write the scripts on the tour,
1447980	1454220	I'm being filmed, it's a movie, am I making a movie, yeah, hey, what's it like to be so smart,
1454220	1458140	I don't know, yeah, I'm producing the movie, am I being smart, paying for the whole thing,
1460540	1466060	here you go CBS, hey, I did it, I did it, I did it, I wrote a script, okay, we have a couple notes,
1466060	1470620	yeah, that should be easy, I can knock that out in a day, do you promise, what do you mean,
1470620	1477980	of course, it'll be done in a day, six days later, yeah, okay, there you go, wait, wait,
1477980	1481500	we're on the tour bus most of the time, is that what's going on when you close a little bunk
1481500	1488140	curtain, at this point it's become a figurative, like, I, I, no, I haven't, uh, the irony is that
1488140	1494380	the masturbation only began when the, when the physical masturbating stopped, uh, when you're,
1494380	1499340	when you're in a giant phallic bus containing you and a camera crew asking you questions about
1499340	1504940	yourself, you don't, you really don't need your dick to be involved anymore, you're, you're just,
1504940	1513740	you'll go blind, the whole world is your pussy right now, uh, so, uh, CBS script gets finished,
1514540	1518700	Fox One is not, there's a point where Fox says, listen, really, it has to be done,
1519660	1526060	okay, I, can I have two more days, well, in one and a half days, like, they're going to start making
1526140	1531660	a lot of their decisions, it's a practical answer, okay, so, so, I'll try to get to you one and a
1531660	1536140	half days, yeah, because really, at that point, you're, you're kind of, you know, we'll have to,
1536140	1539420	you know, take it a slower path, meaning that, you know, all these other scripts are going to
1539420	1544140	get picked up and you're, you'll be kind of behind the flock, um, okay, all right, good, so one and a
1544140	1548700	half days later, I'm like, fuck it, it's not finished, so party time, like, because I, I missed
1548700	1553900	it a couple days ago, yeah, it was like, uh, Saturday afternoon was the day that I kind of,
1554380	1558380	like, you know, it would, if I had a shot, I would have, like, turned something into them,
1558380	1564940	and then, so then I didn't, so then I was like, okay, the upside of that is that let's, let's
1564940	1569420	stop burdening the tour with, and so I started, I was just like, oh, let's have a glass of kettle
1569420	1575180	one and let's, uh, let's do some of these shows, like, unburdened, then today, I was at a, as at a
1575180	1581420	bar here in Chicago and I got an email from Fox that was like, script? And I, and I was like,
1582140	1586540	I can't really, I don't have any right to be outraged by any of this, so it's like, this
1586540	1592220	whole thing reminds me of being in college, I'm a procrastinator, I'm always behind schedule and
1592220	1599420	everything, but your professor is Fox, like, that's, and it's not getting an A or a, or an F.
1599420	1604700	He's just being eight years old and, like, not cleaning your room, which is festooned with your
1604700	1608700	own shitty diapers, which you shouldn't be shitting it anywhere because you're eight,
1608700	1614860	and, like, you smearing them all over your own walls, and then your parents coming in and going,
1614860	1621180	smells like shit, you might have a better time in your life if you stopped, like, like, shitting
1621180	1626540	everywhere and raping, and you sucking your thumb and going, it hurts when you say that, and...
1626540	1630860	But we're, we're podcasting this show every night, presumably somebody at each of those
1630860	1634620	networks is listening to all of this, right? Yeah, I know, but that's more shit on the wall,
1634620	1639100	that's self-destruction, it's, like, something's gonna go... So you could get fired before these
1639100	1643100	shows ever get picked up? That could set a new record, yes, is what you're saying. Yes.
1644380	1649820	I have to be the Chuck Yeager of something, Jeff. It's not gonna be quality television.
1650780	1656380	It's gonna have to be, like, like, I have to, like, I, my hope is by the age of 45 I will be
1656380	1663180	able to write backwards and get fired in reverse. Like, I'll actually enter a parallel universe
1663180	1667580	where I'm promoted all the time, because everything is, like, I've inverted, like, some
1667580	1674140	kind of balloon. Now it'll be fine, I'm exaggerating. I think CBS is very happy with their
1674140	1679100	script, it's probably going to be a big hit, I don't care. And I'll edit all this out, I went
1679100	1684700	a little overboard with the honesty tonight. It's a little self-destructive. And nobody, nobody,
1684700	1690620	nobody, there's a gal engaging you over here. This lady works at Fox. Okay.
1693820	1700460	Oh, she said she got a message from Erica Costa who works on the adult swim show and they need
1700460	1708380	me back immediately. Is that true? Wait, are you, you're friends with Eric Acosta? Yeah. Did he
1708380	1715660	send you here as his minion? Okay. I mean, nobody needs to be back there immediately. It's a very
1715660	1721260	fun show to write. Like, the more they feel that way, the funner the show will get. Well,
1721260	1725180	someone had a question over here. I have a question. Yes, a very well-spoken gentleman
1725180	1730140	over here has a question. I do have a question. All right. I mean, well, number one, I have,
1730140	1734220	well, I'm kind of a make-a-wish. You're kind of a make-a-wish? Well,
1734220	1736380	that's neither, that's neither a question nor a statement. Well,
1738300	1743100	but it does sound like entertainment dynamite. Get it over here. Can you just come up and come up
1743100	1757580	before? Make-a-wish implies that he's dying. It's going to get pretty grim up here. I already
1757580	1763420	brought you down talking about my career. Pretend I shed a tear. Pretend?
1769420	1777580	Not good. All right. I have a make-a-wish, but it's because I want you to make me a drink.
1777580	1782300	Oh. That's one. All right. I have two drinks. Because you're dying of thirst.
1782300	1790380	I would play that up. He's dying of thirst, you guys. I just kind of want, I kind of, well,
1790380	1795820	you know, I was really, honestly, I came here and I was just like, I mean, I have,
1797340	1804060	go on. I have a situation. I have a situation called alcoholism. All right. Me too. And I was
1804060	1809980	just really hoping that Dan Harmon would make me a drink. That's not the cure for alcoholism.
1812700	1816540	He doesn't know that. It's part of the affliction is you don't know that.
1816540	1822140	But I have a different question besides that. Okay. And I don't know if this will,
1822860	1827820	I don't want to get deep or whatever, but friends. Okay. Here's my question. Friends.
1827820	1831340	How can you make friends with the audience? No, no, no, no, no, not that. Reveal you
1831340	1837900	of leukemia and ask for world peace. Not that at all. My question was, because obviously,
1837900	1843340	I mean, you portray yourself as an asshole and I think of myself as an asshole. Like I am
1843340	1853660	shitty to people like left and right. And now, and you portray yourself as that and whatever.
1853660	1860700	But so how, how have you been able to surround yourself with people that are actually talented?
1861260	1867820	Like Rob Drop is, is, is, he's a smart man. Right. And, and then you got all the channel
1867820	1874460	one on one crowd. And they're all, I mean, you've got a lot of good people in your situation.
1874460	1877740	So you're saying you're asking Dan, what makes him less of an asshole than you?
1880140	1887420	Not quite close. Very close. More like, why, why are you able
1888380	1893100	to have talented people around you? Right. And I mean,
1896620	1899980	are you saying, are you, am I getting your, come on, you know,
1902300	1906460	are you guys at the worst? If I'm getting your question right, what you're asking is,
1907180	1911980	you watch what I do and you, and you say to yourself, well, I've got the, I'm an asshole
1911980	1917260	part down and you want to know where the success comes in. What am I not doing right?
1917980	1924140	I'm tapping my nose like charades. I mean, my answer is going to sound self-aggrandizing.
1924140	1929420	I'm going to say I have good taste in people or I'm going to say young. Cause I, I've seen you
1929420	1934140	like at, uh, I w I went to Wisconsin. So I've seen your brother's ad even like when you did
1934220	1943740	the brother's subs bullshit. Right. Cousin subs. Yeah. Sorry. No, exactly. No, he was a young
1943740	1949980	pimply dude, but yeah. So, but for some reason you were able to surround yourself with talented
1949980	1958700	people. Right. So, well, how does that explain this moment right now? I obviously don't have
1959580	1972700	like untalent repellent. So you're a talented person and also awful. Right. I mean,
1972700	1978940	by your own admission. So you've been able to find a community. The answer, my friend,
1978940	1996140	is a rap battle. Breakdown Chicago style. I'm rapping week. I'm rapping wild. Got my man.
1996140	2004620	I can't remember his name on the stage. It doesn't matter what I do. Bar's set so low. I can
2004620	2010460	fuck a shoe. Gonna wrap a while. I'm going to hand him the mic and hear his prepping style.
2010460	2019020	Go right. Go right. So I just wanted to ask you about your mean of operation.
2019820	2023180	And then I thought that I just want to give you a little bit of
2023980	2032140	fashion with my dick. Because apparently that's how I go. And that might be kind of sick. Wait,
2032140	2039660	hold on. Just wanted to say I woke up this morning and thought I'd get some food. And then I thought
2039660	2048460	what might be kind of good, dude? I thought it might go on home. And I just ruined the room.
2048460	2049900	Ryan, your question was what?
2060700	2065180	I just ruined everything. No, you didn't. I mean, for yourself alone, really.
2068060	2069900	You're really good at that, by the way.
2069900	2075100	They're booing you because that's part of the story. You're not the hero. You're not the hero.
2076060	2079660	They're they're cheering you by booing. You boo Darth Vader.
2079660	2080540	Am I the goddess?
2080540	2083740	Darth Vader owns it. Darth Vader goes, yes, keep booing.
2085660	2086860	He doesn't go like Ryan.
2086860	2092860	You know what? I didn't close someone's throat shut with the force. I'm not. I don't. How do you,
2094300	2101740	on Tatooine, what's your secret with the how do you? He goes fucking duh duh, I'm evil. I want to
2101820	2108460	suck the fucking life out of your show and your universe. I want control. I want power.
2108460	2112300	I have a fucking face shaped like a skull with a Nazi helmet on it.
2113340	2117420	That makes him a hero to his own people, at least.
2117420	2120700	At least I'm going to curl into a ball with Jeff right now.
2121660	2124940	Like, I can't find it.
2129420	2131260	This is the only comfort I find.
2132300	2133180	You're doing it wrong.
2134940	2137900	Ryan, everybody, take it for Ryan. Ryan.
2139580	2140060	Fuck it.
2140860	2145740	This episode of Harmontown is brought to you by Fulton and Roark. Jeff, you're sick of spilling
2145740	2149020	all your colognes all over the place. You hate liquid colognes, is that correct?
2149020	2153500	It's my nemesis. It's the thing that gives me nightmare dreams all night long.
2153500	2158940	I can't remember how many times I've walked in on you just covered in sticky wet cologne.
2158940	2164060	I have traveled and broken a bottle of the cologne that I wear, and then my
2164060	2167340	luggage smells like a French whorehouse for the rest of time.
2167340	2172300	Yeah, but Fulton and Roark is a men's fragrance and grooming company that specializes in solid
2172300	2176700	colognes, shave and shower products, all designed to make getting ready easier and more enjoyable.
2176780	2179820	Now, when you say solid colognes, do you mean like solid in the jazz sense?
2179820	2182380	Like, wow, that jazz solo was solid.
2182380	2186060	You know, I do mean that, but I also mean physically solid as well.
2186060	2189740	Oh, like a little, like you're talking about a wax-based cologne that travels in a little
2189740	2194460	small package that I can't spill all over my luggage and smell like a Mexican
2195420	2199980	tit house. So these are travel-friendly wax-based colognes that can go anywhere.
2199980	2204060	Plus, there's nothing to break or spill, and of course, they all smell fantastic.
2204060	2204860	Fantastic.
2204860	2206140	Like a Mexican tit house.
2208540	2212060	I mean, there's different levels of Mexican tit house.
2212060	2215900	I mean, there's the high-quality ones, there's the ones that you wish you didn't go to.

2296060	2297740	Well, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
2299180	2300220	Okay, all right, yeah.
2303020	2304940	Discretion dot dot dot valor.
2307020	2310220	I was just thinking, like, you know, like if you, you know, if you
2310700	2315180	just, just into the, into the spin, you know, like, like when you're driving on the ice.
2315260	2317740	Where did you get the little Dorothy Parker hat you had on there for a while?
2317740	2319820	The, the Erica Costa messenger.
2319820	2320540	Oh, wow.
2320540	2325900	Had a little Dorothy Parker hat, which doubled as a Kango when the, uh, when the shit hit the fan.
2325900	2327340	All right, so enough about my career.
2328060	2329740	Let's bring Spencer up right now, everybody.
2329740	2352620	Yeah, he is the dungeon master.
2353180	2353980	Uh, the earlier.
2353980	2357180	Yeah, we should, we should have brought him up a moments ago.
2358140	2359900	Uh, yeah, they love you, Spencer.
2359900	2360780	We love you.
2360780	2362540	God, thanks, guys.
2362540	2363820	Spencer, I see you wearing pants.
2363820	2366940	He, he boasted he could wear shorts all day today and not be bothered.
2366940	2370540	Nothing but tweets from people saying, wear pants, bundle up.
2371260	2372140	You're a pussy.
2372140	2373420	Like, I'm just like over it.
2374940	2376620	Well, people take their weather seriously.
2376620	2378700	I don't take your guys's weather seriously.
2378700	2382140	I could be rocking shorts, but they're concerned about your own well-being.
2382140	2383740	People care about your health now.
2383740	2384780	Well, fuck them.
2385100	2388620	Wow, I appreciate your concern.
2390620	2393180	Spencer, I understand that you had your first deep dish pizza today.
2395820	2397820	I said, I said Spencer did.
2397820	2402060	Yeah, I also took my first shit in Chicago.
2404380	2405740	No, no, your pizza is good.
2405740	2406540	Your pizza is good.
2406540	2408220	I like you guys and your pizza.
2410220	2411260	So flattered.
2411420	2415100	They, they're, they're, they rolled up the red carpet for us here.
2415100	2416860	This is the warmest audience I've ever.
2416860	2417420	It's amazing.
2417420	2418700	What a cool room in front of.
2418700	2419660	Yeah, I think.
2419660	2423260	It's like being in the actual second city main stage, but without all the political shame.
2427260	2431820	Speaking of which, I met somebody outside before the show that I wanted to roll the dice on,
2431820	2433020	so to speak, like bringing up.
2433020	2438540	I wanted, I wanted the audience to meet him and see if he provides as much joy for, for,
2438540	2443020	for them as he, as I, I was, I was very entertained by this, this guy.
2443020	2444220	Is it, is it Ben Ben?
2444220	2444700	Are you here?
2448300	2448780	Over here.
2448780	2449340	He's over here.
2449340	2449900	Oh, there you are.
2449900	2450860	Okay.
2450860	2451660	Are you willing to come up?
2455660	2456540	This is Ben.
2460620	2461660	Just went on.
2461660	2462460	Check, check, check.
2462460	2463100	Okay.
2463100	2464380	You take that one.
2464380	2466220	You don't have to do however you want.
2466220	2467420	I want you to do your thing.
2467420	2467820	Thank you.
2467820	2469180	I just wanted, I wanted to talk to you.
2469180	2472940	I feel like marionette strings have been attached and now the monkey has to dance.
2472940	2473820	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2473820	2474380	Don't think that way.
2474380	2475740	No, no, no, no, no, no.
2475740	2476940	Being exploited is fine.
2476940	2477340	It's cool.
2477340	2477820	Okay, okay.
2478380	2479100	It's good.
2479100	2481180	It's like, it's, it's, it's the rigor.
2481180	2482620	It's what people do now.
2482620	2483820	That's how the world works.
2483820	2484300	Yeah, yeah.
2484300	2486620	I want, I want to, how old are you?
2486620	2487100	16.
2487100	2487420	Okay.
2487420	2490380	And your parents are here and they're cool with me talking about my nuts and my butts.
2490380	2492140	Yeah, they're good.
2492140	2492700	Right.
2492700	2496780	And you're, you're, you're aspiring a filmmaker to turn the crowd against you.
2496780	2497420	Yeah, absolutely.
2497580	2499900	So the marionette strings have been attached.
2501100	2506700	But really it was your, you know, like, like, like, uh, uh, I don't, I don't know, I don't
2506700	2510060	know how to not put you on the spot, but I wanted to kind of, I just wanted to talk to
2510060	2512540	you a little bit because you were very flattering before the show.
2512540	2515020	And I also thought the audience might be a little charmed with you,
2515020	2519260	but now they're going to feel compelled to, but then again, your lead in couldn't have been better.
2522700	2522940	Yeah.
2524940	2526620	You're, you're safe and secure here.
2526700	2534060	It's not, yeah, you could lift up your shirt and Hitler's face could be tattooed on you
2534060	2537900	and start speaking and he would still kill.
2541100	2542460	But I just want to, cause I don't know.
2542460	2544460	There was, I don't, I'm not a good interviewer.
2544460	2545020	No, that's okay.
2545020	2546140	I can, I can babble.
2546140	2546380	Okay.
2546380	2547100	That's totally fine.
2547100	2547500	All right.
2548540	2553660	And like building upon the babbling, you know, it's, it's, it's weird that when I started,
2553660	2560060	you know, watching community and started, um, you know, there's, uh, it's a cultural obsession.
2560060	2568060	And, um, I, I like being, and just speaking generally, I think I like the whole geek concept
2568060	2572460	bothers me because I think it's, it's more important to like things than to like the concept
2572460	2573740	of liking things.
2573740	2578860	So that's why I, you know, and so there's like this fetishization that's occurred,
2578860	2583020	you know, where it's like, I don't like, you know, I'm not passionate about filmmaking.
2583100	2587420	I'm not passionate about Hitler or, you know, whatever.
2587420	2590220	I'm just, I just like liking things, you know?
2590220	2595660	And so like on top of that, um, part, and so, and so that's, you know, I kind of, you
2595660	2598940	sort of groove on that wavelength when I read about, you know, when I read about you.
2598940	2602860	Um, and so I think that's, that's, that's fascinating and that's great.
2602860	2607660	And that was like hugely important to me, but like I was reading it, there was like this,
2607660	2613900	um, bizarre sense of empathy building that I like, he's like, Oh, I don't idolize Dan
2613900	2614380	Harmon.
2614380	2615660	There's like this weird empathy.
2615660	2619100	And I realized, you know, that's not like a, Oh, I'm so flatter thing.
2619100	2621180	Oh, I'm an obnoxious 15 year old boy.
2621180	2625500	What that means though, is that for whatever reason, you're 15 now.
2625500	2625980	Oh, sorry.
2625980	2626220	Six.
2626220	2627900	Well, my birthday was on January 7th.
2627900	2629340	So there's a time fluctuation.
2631660	2634540	Is it narcissistic of me to try to figure out where I was 16 years ago?
2635260	2639500	If I, uh, where would, where would you have been 16 years ago or when you were 16?
2639500	2639980	All right.
2639980	2639980	
2641420	2642140	Exactly.
2642140	2643340	Very much so.
2643340	2644060	All right.
2644060	2647740	He would, he would have, he would have clarified your name.
2647740	2647980	Yeah.
2647980	2649180	Is your momma here tonight?
2649180	2649820	No.
2649820	2650780	Thank heavens for that.
2650780	2651420	Thank heavens.
2652220	2656860	But, but like building on top of that, so we have the genital mutilation and the liking
2656860	2660940	genital mutilation, not liking genital mutilation.
2660940	2661580	Back it up.
2661580	2662300	Back it up.
2662300	2663660	You can generalize it.
2663900	2665020	Back that thought up.
2665020	2665500	I'm sorry.
2665500	2670620	It's like, uh, like I associated, uh, filmmaking or whatever with general mutilation.
2670620	2671180	I don't know why.
2672140	2674700	Jeff, Jeff, control him, control him.
2674700	2679900	I, this is out of control right now, man.
2679900	2681420	Well, so am I sometimes.
2681420	2684700	Okay, Ben, Ben, you met Dan in line today.
2684700	2685820	I absolutely did.
2685820	2689580	And, uh, how did you make the leap from what he was doing to general mutilation?
2689580	2690780	He was masturbating so much.
2691340	2691580	Yeah.
2691580	2693100	Well, here's the thing though.
2693420	2693900	Ben.
2693900	2694220	Yes.
2694220	2695580	Have you started masturbating?
2695580	2696220	Absolutely.
2696220	2696700	I have.
2696700	2697420	You have?
2697420	2697660	Yeah.
2698780	2699180	Prove it.
2705500	2707100	We're all going to jail tonight, everybody.
2710380	2712460	And CBS is going to bail us all out.
2712460	2712620	Yeah.
2714620	2715980	Like now, are you sorry?
2715980	2716700	Get back to work.
2716700	2721500	So, so you got to introduce a possibility because you're a Joseph Campbell fan.
2721500	2723980	And like, that's like the heuristic through which, you know,
2723980	2725340	you view the world, which is great.
2725340	2729900	So like, here's the thing, um, in, in, like, like, in your heuristic,
2729900	2731580	at least the persona is heuristic.
2731580	2733980	Um, you're Django, right?
2733980	2738940	Except you're not black and you're not Jamie Fox, but you're sort of, it's like,
2739580	2741420	it's like that narrative, right?
2741420	2744860	Of freeing yourself and I am, you know, self actualizing.
2745340	2747660	Um, but here's the thing.
2747660	2753420	Have you entertained the possibility that you're actually Samuel L. Jackson
2753420	2756620	and that, or like, as a point, someone else is going to become Django.
2757500	2759820	Have you entertained the possibility that you are me?
2759820	2761500	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2761500	2763660	That that's why I brought you up.
2763660	2765900	And then like, I am so narcissistic.
2765900	2767180	And then I'm so entertained by you.
2767180	2770300	Because, because I've never met, I'm sitting state.
2770300	2772300	You're in the middle of the stage and I'm sitting stage left.
2772300	2772940	He's stage right.
2772940	2775020	Like it's like perspective is shrinking you.
2775500	2778060	Yeah, well, sending you back in time.
2778780	2780700	We just need to his right.
2780700	2788460	We just need a six year old child going, I mean, I don't mean give me a bottle.
2788460	2794380	I just mean, but because the world being what it is now, he's, he's, he's an earlier.
2794380	2795420	He's a prodigy.
2795420	2798940	You like, if you're, if you're a chess champion, like he's a chess champion
2798940	2801900	in an earlier age, much sexier and he's got his shit more together.
2801900	2802060	Yeah.
2802060	2802700	Yeah.
2802700	2804300	I mean, ladies, come on, Ben.
2804300	2806060	I have to push him off the Acropolis tonight.
2807420	2808780	He's 16 ladies.
2811100	2813100	He likes to mutilate those genitals.
2814540	2816220	He's already started masturbating.
2816220	2821260	That means, yeah, biologically, you can get into the grand plan.
2821260	2825580	I hate to tell anybody sexual advice, but you don't have to mutilate yourself to masturbate.
2825580	2826460	Right.
2826460	2828300	There's, there's, there's lotions and whatnot.
2828300	2830060	I need, I need to text some people.
2830060	2830540	Oh dear.
2830540	2831420	His coke just fell out.
2832060	2837740	Oh, that's, but my point was like the idea is to sort of, um, because
2837740	2839020	are you carrying a gun right now?
2841020	2846060	The easy thing to do is to come up and, and, uh, see, he's already learned.
2846060	2848300	Sometimes you, sometimes you just blow past Jeff.
2848300	2848940	Yeah.
2848940	2850780	The easy thing to do is to come up and idolize you.
2850780	2852860	And I wanted to insult you first so that the idol.
2852860	2855980	So that the idolizing was felt more personal and true.
2855980	2856300	Yeah.
2856300	2858300	But that 35 year old dude didn't get that.
2858300	2863980	Like he came up and was like, well, I'm going to gain his respect.
2866380	2870540	Well, it's like, it's like, you know, the, the, the, the community is, is great.
2870540	2876140	Cause it's like, you know, how to relate to people and, um, you know, and, and, and so,
2876140	2877580	you know, you're huge.
2877580	2880620	You provide people like me.
2880620	2883900	Like it's like, here, I'm a, wait, let me, can I, all right.
2883900	2884300	All right.
2884300	2884540	Go ahead.
2885340	2890860	I'm an, this is like, uh, matter and anti-matter.
2890860	2891100	Yeah.
2892220	2895660	I'm 16, which means that I'm obnoxious and narcissistic.
2895660	2900860	And then I see someone who is publicly obnoxious and narcissistic and also
2900860	2905820	40 ramblingly, you know, so like I am at 15.
2905820	2910700	And I think, Hey, I, you know, filmmaking is really hard to do and really hard to be
2910700	2911500	successful in.
2911500	2916220	But if me with a dashing beard, pirate man can do it.
2916220	2919500	Maybe I can, you know, and so that, that's the, that's the thought.
2919500	2919820	Yeah.
2919820	2920140	Thank you.
2920140	2920940	That's why I want it.
2920940	2921340	Yeah.
2921340	2922220	That's amazing.
2922220	2923340	I'm leaving town with him.
2926620	2930380	Ryan, before we do that, Ryan, where, uh, you're 15, 16.
2930380	2931980	We can't get a straight answer out of you on that.
2933180	2935580	Where do you see yourself at, uh, at 40 years old?
2935580	2936700	What Dan is right now.
2936700	2939980	If you had your pie in the sky dreams, where would you be at 40?
2941660	2944540	Well, aim big like, like shoot for the moon.
2944540	2948060	Well, um, don't be bashful.
2948060	2948380	Okay.
2948380	2949180	All right.
2949180	2949740	I know that.
2949740	2954300	I know that you're normally a very bashful fellow, but I want you to come out of your
2954300	2957820	shell for once in your life and tell us where you think you, like, if you, if you could
2957820	2959900	have your dream, where would you be at 40 years old?
2960700	2964540	Well, um, you know, again, I think Joseph Campbell again.
2965980	2969340	Well, you know, was it, was it Joseph Campbell who said, follow your bliss.
2969340	2974780	So the dream shouldn't be, I want to have all the money, all the cars, all of the mamas,
2975420	2976140	the dream.
2977180	2979660	This is the effect I'm having on, uh, with the podcast.
2979660	2981260	This is the new generation coming up.
2981260	2983420	The generation of mama fuckers.
2983420	2984140	The Herman youth.
2985100	2988700	Yeah, you're, you're, you're corrupting the youth, but the, you know, the dream is use
2990620	2991340	with the vodka.
2991340	2992220	You seem happy.
2992220	2996620	You seem to have followed the bliss, you know, that's the good, that's a good takeaway for
2996620	2997420	a 16 year old.
2997420	2998220	I'm glad.
2998220	3002300	The vodka, I mean, you, you seem, you, you know, it's, it's, you seem to be
3002300	3004300	happy and surrounded by people who like what they're doing.
3004300	3005500	But what do you want, Ben?
3005500	3007180	What do you want for yourself?
3007180	3009180	You want to be an alcoholic 40 year old with a beard?
3010220	3014540	If, if that's what, if that, if you're following your bliss and if this is like,
3014540	3019580	you know, living as close as you can to being happy and feeling like you're,
3019580	3025020	you know, um, if, yeah, no, I'm gonna, if, if, if life is essentially.
3025180	3029020	I feel like you'd be, I feel like you'd be very good selling, selling newspapers in a corner in
3029020	3029580	the thirties.
3032780	3033740	It's, it's a little hat.
3035740	3036540	Give us a topic.
3036540	3039100	And do you think you could talk simultaneously with me?
3039100	3041180	We'll just both address the topic at the same time.
3041180	3041660	Yes.
3041660	3042060	Okay.
3044700	3045500	Don't listen to me.
3045500	3048060	And I won't listen to you, but just talk to them.
3048060	3050860	Yeah, just open your mind.
3050860	3051740	Talk straight out.
3051740	3052700	Don't listen to Dan.
3052700	3053900	Dan, don't listen to Ben.
3054300	3056860	What we've been doing for the entire lives.
3056860	3057580	Precisely, precisely.
3057580	3058780	And I've been doing this for 16 years.
3058780	3059340	All right.
3059340	3059580	Okay.
3061660	3062940	Wait, what's the topic?
3063820	3063980	Yeah.
3063980	3064700	What's the topic?
3065260	3066140	Narcissism.
3066140	3066460	All right.
3066460	3067100	Oh, okay.
3069100	3069980	Yeah.
3069980	3070620	Yourself.
3070620	3079340	Narcissism is the word that I use most often because somebody like you look into a stream
3079340	3089180	at themselves and turn into a plant by doing it, which means that you never close your eyes
3089180	3096540	when you look at me anymore and figuring to the extent that you're honest about it.
3096540	3097180	How can you not?
3097180	3101500	If you knew how to be honest about it, you would be able to liberate yourself.
3101500	3105260	Like there's a version of Narcissus that doesn't have to be a plan.
3105260	3108700	He could get up and walk around and be Narcissus, but not be a plan.
3108780	3111740	And then this got really sad and existential.
3113100	3114060	Ben and Dan, everybody.
3114060	3114700	Ben and Dan.
3114700	3115260	Thank you, Ben.
3118300	3119820	Ben, that was magnificent.
3119820	3120460	Thank you, Ben.
3122540	3124380	Of course you can ask me a question after the show.
3124380	3129820	Can I ask you a question after everything I do so that I can not kill myself?
3131420	3135500	I want to check in with Ben after every decision I made.
3135500	3137340	Yeah, but we're not done with Ben by any chance.
3137340	3137820	Yeah, yeah.
3138460	3139100	Where are you sitting?
3141020	3141900	Okay, go back there.
3141900	3143180	And his brother's cool too.
3143180	3143900	Don't get too jealous.
3143900	3146460	He's one year older and he's getting all the attention, but it's just because
3147900	3148860	next year I'll have you up.
3150060	3153740	Because his brother wants to be a graphic designer and Ben wants to be a director.
3154300	3155740	You and I, it's Ryan, right?
3156700	3157420	Richard.
3157420	3157900	I knew that.
3159100	3162780	We both know Richard's a cooler name and that graphic designers are more creative than directors.
3164780	3165740	You're an unsung hero.
3165980	3170780	You're going to have more of an impact than him, but he'll be over there garnering all the attention.
3172060	3174380	Probably autoerotic asphyxiation.
3177180	3178460	Autoerotic mutilation.
3180140	3180620	Wow.
3182300	3184380	I think he meant manipulation, genital manipulation.
3184380	3185500	I don't think he did, Dan.
3188140	3190300	That guy doesn't strike me as somebody who misspeaks.
3190940	3195660	I think we're talking about a mutilated penis.
3196860	3198060	Was I wrong to bring him up?
3198060	3199580	Was that a bad instinct?
3201900	3203820	If you met him before a show, wouldn't you be like,
3203820	3206220	could you come up and meet a couple of friends of mine?
3208220	3212140	If you're walking down a beach and you stub your toe in an old-timey lantern,
3212140	3213660	you have to rub it.
3215260	3216220	You have to mutilate it.
3218380	3219420	Until there's nothing left.
3220940	3221420	All right.
3221420	3224300	Should we put Spencer on the spot?
3224300	3225100	Give him a free...
3225100	3225580	Excuse me.
3225580	3226060	I'm burping.
3227580	3228300	You okay, Dan?
3228300	3229180	Give him a little...
3229180	3229980	He's in Prilosec?
3229980	3230380	You all right?
3231020	3232300	No, I don't need Prilosec.
3232300	3236140	Everyone, since the night we asked for it, people have been bringing Prilosec like
3238780	3241020	just ancient people to some druidic temple.
3241740	3245340	It's a very expensive drug, Prilosec.
3245340	3246220	It's heartburn medicine.
3246220	3249500	I mentioned that I needed some in Summerville
3249500	3256380	and then people are bringing Prilosec like a weird druidic ritual.
3257740	3259900	It's shameful and amazing and cool.
3261260	3262380	Why do you have such bad heartburn?
3262380	3262860	Is there...
3262860	3263340	I don't know.
3263340	3266300	I have to go in and get it checked out because I was just noticing today.
3266300	3267660	I saw a commercial for it.
3267660	3269580	Larry the Cable Guy is the new spokesman for it.
3270700	3272940	So I was like, I got to get off this train and...
3274940	3276220	That certainly is a signpost.
3276220	3279340	I never bothered to read the box, but I bothered to read the fine print.
3280300	3288700	On the commercial, it said, don't take it for 14 days and don't take it for more than four months.
3288700	3291020	I've been taking Prilosec for fucking...
3291020	3291580	I don't know.
3291580	3292780	Season two of Community.
3294380	3295420	I got to go to the doctor again.
3296620	3299420	I'm sure it's related to Popeye spinach here.
3300300	3301980	I'm sure it's not great on your epiglottis.
3301980	3304620	It probably wore down maybe the flap above the bibbap
3304620	3308300	and then maybe stomach acid gets up more.
3308300	3308780	That's a guess.
3308860	3312300	I'm not a doctor, but here's what the doctors did when I went to them.
3312300	3313580	I went to my regular doctor.
3313580	3314700	I said, I'm having heartburn.
3314700	3315660	I have frequent heartburn.
3315660	3316540	He said, how frequent?
3316540	3317420	I said, it's this frequent.
3317420	3319500	He said, okay, you should go to a specialist.
3319500	3320460	I'm like, great.
3320460	3321420	That's what I expected you to say.
3321420	3322220	And that's how it goes.
3322220	3323260	He gave me a referral.
3323260	3325500	I went to this guy, the specialist.
3325500	3326700	I went into the specialist.
3326700	3328700	The specialist said, what do you have?
3328700	3329660	I have heartburn.
3329660	3330700	How frequent do you have it?
3330700	3331420	I have it this frequent.
3331420	3333420	He said, okay, get up on the table.
3333420	3334460	Take down your pants.
3334460	3335180	And I was kind of like...
3336140	3337340	He didn't say...
3337340	3341820	I mean, I could have said no, but he just kind of took charge
3341820	3343180	and was like, get up on the table.
3343180	3343980	Take down your pants.
3343980	3344940	And I was like, okay.
3344940	3345740	And I took down my pants.
3345740	3346780	He's like, roll over.
3349100	3349900	And he stuck his finger.
3349900	3350940	Are you sure he was a doctor?
3350940	3353900	He stuck his finger up my ass and felt around
3355500	3357900	and said, everything seems fine.
3359100	3360780	No sign of external hemorrhoids.
3361580	3363100	Two things I know aren't true.
3364060	3365100	The only things...
3365100	3367500	I know everything's not fine in my butthole.
3368220	3369260	It's my butthole.
3369260	3370220	I'm Dan Harmon.
3372540	3373820	I'm the butthole of people.
3373820	3375740	I know my butthole isn't fine.
3375740	3376860	It's not like a...
3376860	3379020	Like, if you're a butthole expert, you don't...
3379020	3379820	I know that there's...
3382060	3384060	What part of heartburn didn't you understand?
3384060	3384700	Wait, wait.
3384700	3385500	He shoved his finger up my ass.
3385500	3387180	How does your butthole affect heartburn?
3387180	3387820	I don't know.
3389020	3392620	But after he did it, he gave me a referral to a specialist.
3393500	3395100	And I didn't go, Jeff.
3395100	3397900	And, well, because it fooled me twice.
3399020	3399980	I did the first...
3400860	3402380	The first guy did nothing.
3402380	3403980	The second guy raped me.
3405180	3407260	I'm gonna send you to a guy named Ray Ray.
3407260	3410700	And, yeah, who does that guy refer you to?
3410700	3413660	The real doctor sent me to a rape doctor.
3414780	3417340	And I don't mean a doctor that helps rape victims.
3417340	3418620	Obviously, I told you the story.
3418620	3419820	I meant, well, don't groan it.
3419820	3420540	It's not a pun.
3421820	3422620	It's not he-haw.
3423660	3424160	Uh...
3425660	3426140	It's rape.
3426140	3429020	All right, whoever wrote that, you take rape too lightly.
3429020	3430780	Spencer, I'm gonna try to...
3430780	3431340	I know you hate it.
3431340	3432140	We're gonna put you on the spot.
3432140	3436620	Spencer has a gift of creating monsters as a dungeon master out of thin air.
3438860	3439580	Freestyle.
3439580	3440060	Spencer.
3441820	3444060	Freestyle monster DM-ing.
3445100	3446060	The proctologist.
3447740	3449420	With a Kree, the door opens.
3449580	3453420	And immediately you feel something's not right.
3454860	3456620	Take off your pants, he says.
3457340	3458620	It's all right, he says.
3459420	3460940	I'm a doctor, he says.
3463820	3464380	But no.
3466060	3467020	The proctologist.
3468060	3469020	Oh, he's good.
3469020	3469500	Thank you.
3475500	3478140	Spencer, you're becoming a national treasure.
3478140	3478780	You know that, right?
3479580	3480080	Yeah.
3484300	3485660	That's awesome, but...
3486380	3487100	He's becoming a national...
3487100	3488140	Can someone give me a job?
3489740	3491100	All right, yeah, we haven't asked you this.
3491100	3494220	If you had any job in the world, what would your dream job be?
3494220	3494720	It's...
3495180	3496220	No, no, no.
3497660	3500060	Don't tell Apple this, but I'm a PC user.
3502220	3502720	Nice.
3504540	3506700	Dishonest Apple employee.
3507660	3511260	Wearing a smile that can only be described as practiced.
3512220	3516540	The blue shirt at a ploy approaches you, asking if you found everything okay.
3517740	3520700	But behind his eyes, you can tell he doesn't really care.
3522780	3523260	That's all.
3530620	3532380	But, uh, career?
3532380	3533180	I don't know, man.
3533980	3535340	You should be a writer.
3535340	3536380	Do you ever write anything down?
3536380	3537260	Do you write stuff?
3537260	3541340	I used to, like, I can write when I'm prompted and I enjoy it,
3541340	3545580	but, like, unless I'm prompted or have some reason to do it, I just won't do it at all.
3545580	3546460	It's like Dan Herman.
3548140	3550460	Yeah, that's how I get the big bucks, baby.
3551180	3552380	I guess I'm on the right track.
3552380	3553180	Yeah, yeah.
3553180	3554460	Spencer, I'm being attacked...
3555020	3559340	I'm on a path and I'm attacked by a writer's block.
3559340	3560140	What does it sound like?
3562140	3564700	A large block interposes your path.
3565660	3568140	Looking around, you see no obvious exits.
3568780	3572380	You sit down and see if you might be able to hammer out a solution.
3572380	3573580	But none arrives.
3575260	3576380	It'll be a long night.
3583420	3585900	Your genitals are mutilated.
3587740	3590220	Looking at the dripping mess between your legs.
3594700	3600380	That's all, that's all.
3600380	3601500	That's all the time we have, folks.
3603180	3604060	Tipper my staff.
3604620	3606300	Dripping mess, good heavens.
3607660	3609100	Yeah, it's a dungeon.
3610140	3613340	So, Spencer, I'm being attacked by procrastination specifically.
3613340	3613980	I'm a writer.
3613980	3614860	I'm on an adventure.
3614860	3617100	I'm being attacked by the procrastination monster.
3618140	3621980	Sitting at your desk, you come across a flash of insight.
3622780	3624700	But then, a tweet.
3628700	3629340	All right, all right.
3632460	3633420	He's Cal Ripken.
3636860	3639580	Yeah, he really is.
3639580	3640460	The Sixler.
3640460	3641660	Sixler, isn't it?
3641660	3642700	Guys keep saying Sixer.
3642700	3643740	Not like the Seventy Sixer.
3643740	3646700	Some guy in Germany is going to be getting all these tweets.
3646700	3647500	We love you.
3647500	3648860	As in one who Sixles.
3650460	3651740	What is the significance of Sixler?
3652540	3653900	It's time, you guys.
3659820	3663020	Let's reveal Spencer's conjoined twin, the Fieveler.
3665500	3667020	Open your mind.
3667020	3668700	The funny thing is there is a Fieveler,
3668700	3670220	but the Sevenler doesn't exist.
3671020	3675340	Anyway, we were playing a game that was kind of like D&D,
3675340	3677820	like a freeform RPG that my friend ran.
3678060	3682300	And he was trying to be interesting and offbeat.
3682300	3684700	So for character creation, he drew what
3684700	3687660	was kind of like one of those speaking.
3687660	3688620	I don't know what they're called.
3688620	3688940	I don't know.
3688940	3691340	It was a circle with fucking drawings on it.
3691340	3692220	And you can spell.
3693180	3694140	That's what I was thinking.
3694140	3695180	But that's not what it is.
3695180	3698460	It was a C&C, like a farm animal noise machine.
3698460	3699340	C&C, right?
3699340	3699900	Yeah, OK.
3699900	3702220	C&C. So the cow goes.
3702860	3704060	Yeah, that's the one.
3704060	3707260	But it had objects like it had a baseball
3707580	3711020	head of lettuce and a colander and Master Chief from Halo.
3711020	3715100	And so the idea was you pick two elements
3715100	3716540	and then he forms your character.
3716540	3719900	So I picked a bagel and a burglar,
3719900	3721180	and I became the bagler.
3721180	3722620	And I didn't like that.
3722620	3726460	So I chose a six and a bagel, and I became the sixler.
3726460	3727740	And we played the game.
3727740	3729180	My friend was the colander.
3729180	3731340	And it was a good game.
3731340	3733260	Like instead of rolling dice to hit,
3733260	3736140	we'd have to throw paper balls through like his move
3736140	3737900	outstretched arms, like a circle.
3738460	3740060	And so it was actually kind of interesting.
3740060	3744140	But anyway, the sixler was just a pretty cool dude.
3744140	3747180	And like a volcano exploded, but he was fine.
3747180	3748940	Like he was right next to it and was just like,
3748940	3750140	I'm a cool dude.
3750140	3752060	And the lava didn't affect him.
3752060	3753260	And that just kept going on.
3753260	3756140	Like I'd step into traps, and the trap wouldn't affect me
3756140	3757500	because I was a cool dude.
3757500	3760620	And it wasn't my game.
3760620	3762300	Like this was someone else's choice too.
3762300	3762940	I could have died.
3764540	3765100	But yeah.
3765420	3767500	And then I thought the sixler sounds cool.
3767500	3768460	Like it's got an X.
3768460	3770220	It's got the x sound.
3770220	3772780	It's got like L sounds, R sounds, S sounds,
3772780	3773500	all your good sounds.
3775100	3777820	And it's original enough to be an online handle.
3777820	3782780	It's not the sixler 42 or the sixler heart 1437.
3782780	3784300	But it was just the sixler.
3784300	3787020	So any time I sign up for an internet,
3787020	3788860	I don't need numbers after it.
3788860	3790380	So I just kind of stuck.
3790380	3790860	All right.
3790860	3794300	That was practical and sentimental.
3794300	3795900	And all right.
3798780	3799500	What do you think?
3799500	3805260	Is it time to shift into the, this guy said, oh god, yes.
3807260	3809260	Are you saying we should play D&D right now?
3814140	3815740	Aaron McGathey to the stage.
3815740	3816620	Aaron McGathey.
3824620	3827260	And wherever you want to make yourself at home.
3828620	3831500	You won't be the first person to, yeah.
3831500	3832620	Just wherever you want to be.
3832620	3835180	Did you throw a die up on stage?
3835180	3835660	He did.
3835660	3837100	I threw a die.
3837100	3837580	All right.
3837580	3838220	Say it.
3838220	3839740	People are throwing panties.
3839740	3839980	Yeah.
3839980	3843020	People are throwing a multi-sided die at,
3843020	3844780	he's the Tom Jones of D&D.
3845660	3848940	Well, you know, a pair of panties is less of a threat
3848940	3850940	than like hard round objects.
3851260	3853260	Yeah.
3853260	3854300	You can choke on those.
3854300	3854780	Yeah, yeah.
3855740	3857900	And even if you don't, it's just like a,
3857900	3860460	there's a fine line between a die and just a rock.
3860460	3862780	How many people out there in this audience of about,
3862780	3865900	I would say 300, how many of you have ever played D&D?
3867180	3867680	Wow.
3870140	3871340	All the people that got here first.
3873180	3874220	All those who lined up.
3876060	3878860	Spencer has dispensed the character sheets.
3879580	3881900	We should do a, D&D has also become a chance
3881900	3883980	to do a relationship check-in with Erin.
3885180	3887100	For those of you who listened to the Pittsburgh show,
3887980	3889340	it was a doozy.
3890380	3894380	Dan, I got two more emails in the last 30 minutes.
3894380	3895660	From the same person?
3895660	3897740	No, from different people regarding the show.
3897740	3900060	Three very different opinions about the whole thing.
3900060	3901420	Well, I did want to say to the person
3901420	3903660	that wrote Erin an email, the subject line,
3903660	3907500	Dial It Back, where they gave her a bunch of notes
3907500	3911340	along the lines of, you know, you should, whatever.
3911340	3911840	Fuck you.
3913260	3913740	Wait.
3913740	3914380	It was fair.
3914380	3915420	It was fair.
3915420	3919980	Only I get to suggest that Erin needs to be
3919980	3921420	somehow psychologically broken.
3923580	3925900	She's the greatest hero on the face of the earth
3925900	3928060	for ever even coming near me with her vagina,
3929500	3931180	let alone her mind and her soul.
3931180	3931180	
3931180	3932620	I'm going to take that all the way to my heart thing.
3935260	3935980	It took that.
3936060	3937180	You're reading that email to me,
3937180	3939260	where someone was kind of on my side in quotes,
3939260	3942140	for me to go, fuck her, fuck me,
3942140	3943100	fuck everyone.
3943980	3944700	You're the best.
3944700	3946860	You endure a lot, and I'm so sorry.
3946860	3949100	Do we talk about those emails,
3949100	3951660	or do we not want to engage that person?
3951660	3952220	You could read it.
3952220	3953180	It's pretty interesting.
3953180	3954140	I can't read it.
3954140	3954860	I don't know.
3954860	3956700	It seems like a dangerous path to walk down.
3956700	3957740	I have to read.
3957740	3958300	That is true.
3958300	3959100	I would like to make up.
3959100	3961500	It's like when a serial killer writes to the New York Times.
3962460	3964140	Read this, or I'll kill again.
3964140	3965260	It's like, well, wait a minute.
3966860	3969100	I also, I don't think that,
3969100	3969820	just to clarify,
3969820	3972380	I don't think that this email is unreasonable.
3973260	3975500	It's possible to be on this person's side,
3975500	3977580	but don't write a fucking email to a stranger
3977580	3978460	and tell them their business.
3978460	3979260	That's, yeah, that's-
3979260	3981420	Why does a stranger is writing the emails?
3982220	3985020	Like, how do they get your email address?
3985020	3986300	It's my podcast email.
3986300	3987100	Oh, boy.
3987100	3991020	Yeah, so I have several emails.
3991020	3992620	This one's about the Rhode Island show.
3994780	3995260	Goodness.
3995260	3995580	All right.
3998540	3999180	Hey, everybody.
3999180	4000060	Sit back, relax.
4000060	4001500	We're going to read a negative email.
4003180	4004220	Hi, Erin McGathey.
4004940	4006700	Yes, I know I don't actually know you,
4006700	4008140	but I am feeling compelled to write you
4008140	4010460	after listening to Harmontown in Rhode Island
4010460	4012540	because it sounds like you are about to self-destruct.
4015180	4016300	You have to dial it back
4016300	4018380	with the needing constant affirmation
4018380	4020380	of Dan's unflinching love for you.
4020380	4021580	You will drive him crazy,
4021580	4023500	and this will totally undermine your relationship.
4024460	4027260	Asking about his dirty comments
4027260	4029020	to the ladies at the previous show.
4029020	4030540	I'm not sure what she's referring to.
4030540	4032060	And then asking the audience
4032060	4035980	if you should feel bad about if Jeff asking Dan.
4035980	4038140	If this is a nice email, I correct her typos,
4038140	4039180	but I'm just going to read it as is.
4041420	4043340	If you should feel bad about
4043340	4045580	if Jeff asking Dan about fetishes
4045580	4047420	is a reflection of his lack of respect
4047420	4049660	for your relationship sounds really ugly
4049660	4051980	and petty and unnecessary on your part.
4051980	4053580	I am almost the same age as Dan
4053580	4055900	and got that Dan was just joking and being dirty
4055900	4058220	because he has a dirty mind and that shit's funny.
4058220	4061340	I deserve him more than you.
4061980	4063100	I deserve him.
4064380	4066460	Sitting in a room full of cats
4066460	4067980	got dumped by a writer.
4068860	4070540	I got dumped by a writer
4070540	4072940	taking it out on Dan's girlfriend.
4073900	4077980	Also, also Jeff bring up fetishes
4077980	4079340	is just good controlling
4079340	4081260	because it's a titillating and taboo subject
4081260	4082380	and therefore intriguing.
4082380	4084140	I agree. I agree. I agree.
4084140	4086300	Besides, he didn't exclude the possibility.
4088540	4090300	He didn't exclude the possibility
4090300	4091340	that maybe you and Dan
4091340	4093100	are working out new fetishes together.
4094060	4095500	Do not take anything they say
4095500	4097100	or do on stage personally.
4097100	4098460	It's just for the funny
4098460	4099660	and to make people think
4099660	4101980	and possibly some sort of therapy for Dan.
4101980	4103900	He sounds like he's feeling good on stage.
4103900	4105500	I think this may have been written by a zebra.
4107900	4109580	I started listening to your podcast
4109660	4111260	in Harmentown at the same time last year
4111260	4112780	and I am definitely a fan.
4112780	4114940	So I guess I'm just rooting for you and Dan
4114940	4116460	to continue through life together.
4116460	4117260	That's nice.
4117260	4119180	I really think you just don't need
4119180	4121020	to worry so much about his feelings for you.
4121020	4122300	He sounds way into you
4122300	4123900	and that he would be straight up
4123900	4125500	if something was a problem.
4125500	4127180	So just relax and have fun.
4127180	4129020	Brace could go crazy about minutia
4129020	4130940	that isn't really important in the bigger picture
4130940	4132860	and it is a waste of time to dwell on it.
4132860	4134780	Signed the Relaxation Master.
4135580	4137740	Or signed Adam Schmoldberg.
4140540	4141580	Anything, I mean...
4145260	4146700	Fascinating phenomenon where it's like
4146700	4148380	you go, okay, none of that.
4148380	4150060	None of that I disagree with, whatever.
4150060	4151900	Yeah, that's exactly all the shit
4151900	4152780	I would say to Aaron.
4152780	4153500	Like, hey, relax.
4153500	4154780	It's just a show, blah, blah, blah, blah.
4154780	4155660	Don't self-destruct.
4155660	4156780	But fuck you, lady.
4156780	4157260	Fuck you.
4158060	4159980	Like, it's a full-time job being my girlfriend.
4159980	4161260	It's a horrible, horrible...
4161260	4162460	Did you see Backdraft?
4162460	4163420	It's worse than that.
4163420	4165580	It's so much worse.
4165580	4167580	Like, fire is a living thing.
4170300	4172460	I won't read it.
4172460	4173500	I'll just paraphrase.
4173500	4177500	I did get another email which hit home.
4177500	4179340	I got another email that said that...
4179340	4180300	From somebody who just...
4180300	4181500	Who heard The Pittsburgh Show?
4188220	4190220	I got another email about The Pittsburgh Show
4190220	4194140	in which I expressed some insecurity.
4194860	4197500	But as Dan and I discussed earlier today,
4197500	4199420	Dan and I had this really big fight.
4200380	4200620	No.
4203580	4204540	In a world.
4206300	4207660	Dan and I had a really big fight.
4207660	4209100	Dan talked about it on stage.
4209100	4210460	And as I was sitting backstage,
4210460	4211260	I was thinking about the fight,
4211260	4212300	and I was feeling very sad.
4212300	4214140	Went on stage and Dan said,
4214140	4216300	hey, like, was I dishonest about anything?
4216300	4218300	Like, you know, you've been backstage.
4218300	4220620	You haven't had a chance to say your side of the story.
4220620	4222780	Dan hadn't said anything dishonest.
4222780	4226380	But I felt like just hearing him talk about it again
4226380	4227740	made me feel upset.
4227740	4228700	But instead of saying,
4228700	4230700	yeah, that fight made me feel upset,
4230700	4233420	I latched on to something that was more shallow.
4233420	4236220	This bit about masturbating
4236220	4237900	to a 17-year-old volleyball player.
4238780	4242700	And so, which I got an email saying,
4242700	4244700	hey, like, Harmontown's for fun,
4244700	4246460	and this feels terrible as for sadness.
4249420	4250220	Which I was like,
4250220	4252060	oh, I think my podcast is fun sometimes.
4252060	4252620	It's sad fun.
4252620	4254300	It's a fun sad.
4256140	4256780	Right?
4256860	4257900	We laugh through our tears.
4259020	4261660	But they were worried that,
4261660	4262940	and this was Dan's worry,
4262940	4264780	they were worried that because I had said,
4265500	4267180	it hurt my feelings that you talked about this,
4267180	4269020	that Dan would stop talking about things like that,
4269020	4270460	or he would censor himself.
4270460	4271980	And I want to say to that person,
4271980	4274460	and every listener, that no,
4274460	4276220	he can talk about whatever he likes,
4276220	4278700	and that's why I'm crazy in love with him,
4278700	4280860	and I'm going to have all of his little weird babies.
4284300	4285820	And it's fine.
4285820	4287100	And Julie noted.
4287100	4288460	But he talked about something,
4288460	4289340	and it made you cry.
4289340	4291180	You came out on stage and said you were crying back.
4291180	4292300	She's fine, which is fine.
4292300	4293580	Yeah, but I wasn't crying.
4293580	4294860	It's not fine.
4294860	4296540	It's not fine for someone to cry.
4296540	4297980	I mean, her coming out crying is fine.
4300220	4301660	Someone says she's going to pay for it?
4303820	4305900	No, no, no, they're just ordering wings.
4308620	4309740	They're here with their mom,
4309740	4310780	and they're ordering wings.
4311500	4313580	Side note, Dan and I were just in London,
4313580	4315740	and I fainted two times on the Jack the Ripper tour.
4315740	4316540	So when I hear something like,
4316540	4317420	she's going to pay for it,
4317420	4321020	I'm like, holy fuck, I got to stand on the streets.
4322300	4324140	Yeah, so Dan can say whatever he wants.
4324940	4325740	Here are some things.
4325740	4329980	We've been on the road totally great and wonderful.
4329980	4332140	And it's been a lot of fun,
4332140	4334220	but there are some unseen stresses.
4335260	4337180	She fell down, you guys.
4337180	4338300	She fell down the stairs.
4340540	4342140	Now, I thought that joke was obvious,
4342140	4345020	that it was like you were at my side now,
4345020	4346380	and you're going, everybody, Dan's great.
4346380	4347340	We're having a great time.
4348060	4349740	But clearly, I'm an abusive boyfriend.
4349740	4350620	I'm a terrible person.
4351260	4352380	I'm a bad person.
4352380	4354220	You're not an abusive boyfriend.
4354220	4354860	Thank you.
4354860	4355260	Thank you.
4358700	4360140	You psychologically fell.
4361820	4362940	I don't want to continue.
4362940	4364940	On to the doorknob of Dan Harmon.
4364940	4365740	The Pittsburgh show.
4366860	4370700	I don't want to blame things on my hormones endlessly,
4370700	4373420	because I don't want to fuck things up for my sisters.
4374940	4376620	But if I did, if it go a little something.
4378140	4379420	I like this.
4379420	4380620	The period rap.
4385260	4386540	Keep it going when I find the file.
4388700	4389660	I got to find it.
4391500	4393260	Where the fuck is it?
4393260	4394060	Period rap.
4401580	4404300	Ladies, I'm sorry, but I've been emotional.
4404300	4406780	Had my period, and it wasn't casual.
4406780	4409500	I felt really bad, and my stomach felt deep.
4409500	4411980	Like I had someone stomping on my stomach.
4411980	4413180	You know what I mean.
4413180	4414140	It feels terrible.
4414860	4416140	Sorry, this feels terrible.
4416140	4418220	A podcast that you can get on iTunes.
4418220	4419100	I'm the host of that.
4419100	4420940	Please listen to that anyway.
4420940	4421820	Baby, I'm sorry.
4422460	4424700	Sorry about being emotional.
4424700	4426140	Hormones go up and down.
4427260	4428460	They're not casual.
4428460	4429260	Repeated rhyme.
4429260	4430140	Repeated rhyme.
4430700	4434300	Well, now that you're sorry, it forces me to beat on me,
4434300	4435740	whereas than you have ever beat on me,
4435740	4437100	because I have to be self-loathing,
4437100	4439500	so that you've figured out how to get the upper hand with me
4439500	4442620	all the time, which is by taking the low road.
4443820	4447020	So congratulations, and welcome to owning me forever.
4448140	4448780	I love you.
4448780	4449900	Please don't dump me.
4451580	4452460	Breakdown.
4452460	4453500	Period rap.
4453500	4454140	Period rap.
4454140	4454780	Period.
4454780	4455740	Period.
4455740	4456380	Period.
4456380	4457180	Period.
4457180	4458700	Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.
4458700	4459260	Once a month.
4459260	4461900	What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?
4461900	4463180	Three to five days?
4463180	4464380	Clean it out, clean it out.
4464380	4465660	Three to five days?
4465660	4466780	Clean it out, clean it out.
4466780	4467740	Three to five days?
4467740	4468860	Make some space.
4468860	4469580	Is it over?
4471580	4472300	Period.
4472300	4472940	Anne Frank's.
4475180	4475900	Anne Frank's.
4478700	4481980	I wanted to, it was such a mainstream rap,
4481980	4483660	I wanted to add a tinge of indie,
4485420	4487100	just throwing a random thing,
4487100	4488940	make it more of a Lena Dunham-y kind of.
4488940	4491180	In fact, Anne Frank died before she could have a period.
4492220	4494220	Maybe I don't know what being in love is,
4494220	4499420	but your, your, your guy's version of being in love is fucking complex.
4499420	4500620	I think it looks a lot like, I don't know.
4500620	4501260	I don't think so.
4501260	4503660	I figure, I also, I think it's when two people
4504220	4506140	love each other and themselves so much
4506940	4509900	that they don't care about the entertainment of the whole world.
4511580	4516380	I also, I, I got, I would like to conclude this bit
4516380	4518140	and then to enter into Dungeons and Dragons.
4518140	4520860	I would like to read the final email that I got.
4520860	4521500	It's very short.
4522060	4523740	This is going to be the one that says fuck Dan
4523740	4525260	and you're going to lose everybody.
4526060	4529020	This is, this is from a nice gentleman named Rob.
4529020	4529660	Hi, Aaron.
4530300	4532620	I just wanted to let you know that the podcast apartment town
4532620	4534140	from Pittsburgh brought me to tears.
4534700	4535980	Not because you and Dan fought,
4535980	4537420	but because I recently got divorced
4537420	4539500	and part of the reason we didn't stick together
4539500	4541740	is that we never talked about how we really felt with each other
4541740	4543020	like you and Dan are able to do.
4543660	4546300	I know you feel insecure about your relationship with him,
4546380	4547980	but I think you have a huge advantage
4547980	4549580	and that you were able to express yourselves
4549580	4551260	and let each other know how you feel.
4551260	4553420	If you can do that, I'm sure that love will carry you,
4553420	4555340	carry you the rest of the way. Rob.
4556140	4559820	Unsolicited email advice.
4561820	4564780	But the kind you like, it's the kind you like
4564780	4567340	because it enables, it enables you.
4567340	4569740	I'll complain about everything else but this.
4571740	4574540	Just tell me I'm pretty and I look thin today I'll be fine.
4576300	4578380	Spencer, we're being attacked by menstruation.
4579820	4582140	Looking at the calendar with a start,
4582140	4583660	you realize it's her time.
4585100	4586700	Tiptoeing past the door.
4587260	4589500	You think you can make it down the stairs,
4590220	4593900	but then you hear the shattering sound of porcelain on drywall.
4595020	4595500	That's it.
4598300	4602220	I know that the next round of emails is going to be subject headings like
4602220	4606300	just let Spencer talk and get Dan and Aaron off the stage.
4607020	4608860	Yawn about the relationships.
4610060	4613100	Send your emails to emagathy at gmail.com.
4613820	4614300	Is that right?
4615500	4616000	Yeah.
4617500	4620780	All right Spencer, if you will, at long fucking last,
4620780	4623500	take us up to date for the D&D campaign.
4627900	4631100	After meeting up with a group of fish-dwelling humans
4631100	4633100	and stopping by their small village,
4634300	4637420	the group headed to the store to pick up some potions
4637420	4640780	and some paralyzing injectors as well as a length of rope.
4641340	4644700	They set off down in a esophageal tube to fish south
4644700	4648300	where the fabled Kenny either died or never existed in a lake of acid.
4649180	4653820	Crossing the lake on Tenzer's floating disk and entering a dangerously speedy sphincter,
4653820	4657580	the group found themselves on a narrow ledge with a small campsite.
4657580	4660300	There they met, I can't remember his name, I'm going to call him Thomas.
4661500	4664140	The prince of some fiefdom or other, I can't remember.
4665180	4665740	Valicent.
4666940	4667980	Valicent, yeah, okay.
4667980	4669420	Wait, are you making this up?
4669420	4672540	No, it's just I didn't write down names, I never do names.
4672540	4674780	This is hardly the stage, Spencer.
4674780	4675580	I wrote it down.
4675580	4676540	To be improvising.
4676540	4680860	Spencer, Dan, Dan mocked me in Bloomington, but I wrote down,
4680860	4682220	it's Valicent was his name.
4682220	4683660	Oh my god.
4683660	4687500	See, yeah, see, even that's messed up on my note behalf.
4687500	4689340	Valicent, the prince of the fiefdom.
4689500	4692380	Ah, you gave yourself a jestering?
4693740	4696700	It's hard, I've had many and my fingers are huge.
4696700	4698140	How do you have time to take all those notes
4698140	4700460	between creating all those anonymous email accounts?
4705740	4708220	I will never reveal my secrets, Mr. Harmon.
4709900	4712460	Hey, Dan, dial it back, would you?
4714620	4715420	I would love to.
4715660	4719660	After being lured by talk of swords,
4719660	4721420	Valicent returned with the heroes
4721420	4723180	to the small inner fish village.
4723820	4725340	They were off to free themselves
4725340	4727100	from the confines of the infinifish.
4727900	4729660	So you guys are in that village again,
4729660	4731420	remember you kind of went in a big circle
4731420	4732940	after finding out Valicent.
4732940	4734860	Okay, here's the deal, I just want to say something
4734860	4736220	as a player at the table, all right?
4737100	4738460	We are at the point in the tour
4738460	4740060	where we're past the meeting of the goddess,
4740060	4741820	that much is probably clear.
4741820	4743100	It's time to atone with the father,
4743100	4745020	that means accepting your own death.
4745020	4746700	There's no better way to accept your own death
4746700	4749980	than to give way to, you know,
4749980	4752860	like the father Chronos, the baby New Year
4752860	4755260	and the, you know, like the snake sheds its skin.
4755900	4757660	I want the part of Sharpie Butzalot
4757660	4760620	to be played for this segment in Chicago by Ben.
4762860	4764300	My 16 year old self.
4765660	4768540	15 and a half year old Ben, please come to the stage.
4768540	4769740	You're Sharpie Butzalot.
4771180	4774140	I've been stuck in this fish for three episodes.
4774140	4776220	You're 16, 15, maybe you can figure it out.
4776220	4778380	You've just started mutilating yourself
4778380	4780700	and here you go, here's the microphone.
4780700	4782860	Thank you, so are we in a fish?
4782860	4784540	Yeah, have you ever played before?
4784540	4784940	No.
4784940	4789180	Okay, so basically you pretend what I'm saying is true
4791020	4793820	and you act accordingly.
4794540	4795420	Just like church.
4795420	4796460	Yeah, just like church.
4800860	4802700	Standing out, standing out for Ben,
4802700	4803500	partial standing out.
4805900	4806860	This is great.
4806860	4809660	Dan, he's, he's, Dan, he's funnier than you.
4811660	4814700	My trick is, since I framed it with like, he's me.
4815420	4815980	Doesn't matter.
4815980	4819340	Yeah, this is all, I've become Bud Friedman.
4819340	4821500	Dan, I don't want to get super gross, but.
4822460	4824460	If I did, if I go a little something.
4824460	4827420	Ben looks identical to my first boyfriend, Eric Eldard,
4827420	4829100	who showed me his penis in the shower.
4829100	4830540	Identical, identical.
4832700	4833580	For circle, for circle.
4837820	4838540	Relaxed.
4840060	4842700	Let a woman show you how to do things.
4844060	4845020	I'm just kidding.
4845020	4846780	How do we get these stripes off the sweater?
4848300	4849260	I'm just kidding, I'm sorry.
4849260	4851740	Please stop me or I'll continue to be gross.
4851740	4852380	Wow.
4852380	4854940	Well, no, like I don't go to jail yet.
4854940	4859980	So it's like, you know, I mean, I'm not, I'm, it's your fault.
4860380	4862460	Are we playing D&D?
4862460	4863500	We are.
4865900	4867980	That won't stop me teaching you things, though.
4867980	4868460	Okay.
4869660	4871820	Something terrible is about to happen.
4873260	4876940	All right, so Spencer, we got Prince Val, Valison, what's his name?
4876940	4877820	Valison, yes.
4877820	4881820	And he has the sword knowledge, he has the far sword capabilities.
4881820	4884300	The power of the far sword.
4884300	4888780	I say we, it's probably the right idea to go destroy this animal from the inside.
4889740	4892540	And let's march towards the heart of this beast.
4893260	4894460	Absolutely positively.
4894460	4895420	All right.
4895420	4895980	Thank you, Ben.
4895980	4896540	You're welcome.
4896540	4897740	I mean, I mean, Sharpie.
4897740	4898780	Sharpie, thank you, sir.
4898780	4899580	Thank you, Sharpie.
4899580	4900140	Yes.
4900140	4901420	Valison grumbles.
4901420	4906060	I don't know about killing this thing, but you do have to do some damage if you're going to want to escape.
4907020	4908300	Let's head fish west.
4910220	4910860	Fish west?
4911500	4912940	I head fish west.
4912940	4914460	You guys head fish west.
4915180	4921900	At the far wall of a vigil, the village, you're met with what appears to be a largest meat curtain.
4923820	4924940	This is your education.
4924940	4925900	A meat curtain.
4925900	4926940	These things will happen.
4926940	4927660	Don't worry about it.
4927660	4927980	Okay.
4927980	4928940	Yeah, it's just a meat curtain.
4928940	4929740	It's a curtain of meat.
4929740	4930620	It's a curtain of meat.
4930620	4932940	Don't think, don't think, don't think about it.
4932940	4935100	It is part of a sentient being.
4935100	4937260	Okay, because we're in fish.
4937260	4937500	Yeah.
4938940	4939500	They're not actually.
4939500	4941660	I'm almost certain we're breaking some sort of law right now.
4941660	4942300	Yeah, I know.
4942940	4944860	I understood that part.
4945740	4948220	I'm not bashful, but I think this is illegal.
4949900	4954380	Haven't we already, for the lack of a better word, penetrated this meat curtain before?
4955340	4957340	This is actually a different meat curtain.
4957340	4958460	It's a new meat curtain.
4958460	4959100	It's a new one.
4959100	4960380	It's amazing meat curtains.
4960380	4960860	All right.
4960860	4966460	I approach the meat curtain boldly because I'm no stranger to the meat curtain.
4966460	4973180	And I boldly press myself through it.
4974460	4977020	We all press ourselves boldly through the meat curtain.
4977020	4978060	All right, yeah.
4978060	4979180	Yeah, let's do it together.
4979180	4982380	As a team, you stride through the folds of the meat curtains.
4983580	4985660	Behind the curtain is a passage.
4985660	4988380	It's relatively narrow, but still quite the wide,
4988380	4990460	considering it's inside of a living creature.
4991500	4994060	From far off, you can hear the thumping of hearts
4994060	4997660	and the sloshing of blood being pumped through great veins and arteries.
4997660	4998380	It's just like mine.
4999820	5001020	I know, apparently.
5001820	5006220	The floor is slick and squishy, and you find it quite difficult to stand up straight,
5006220	5007020	let alone move.
5007740	5011020	You can see circular holes in the ground full of bubbling green acid.
5012460	5014860	Through the passage is a larger curtain of meat.
5015900	5017180	Jesus, Spencer.
5017180	5019900	We have to cross a floor that's slick,
5019900	5022380	and it's got holes in it, and acid's bubbling through it?
5022380	5024540	Yeah, so it's full of acid holes.
5025100	5029980	So, Spencer, we need to go across this acid hole area, right?
5030540	5031260	Yeah.
5031260	5031900	Okay.
5031900	5035820	Can I take my rope and tie it to an arrow and shoot it across the...
5035820	5038220	Yeah, like in the ceiling, and then swing across like Star Wars?
5038220	5039500	Okay, so do you want to attempt that?
5040380	5041260	Yes, yes.
5041260	5041760	Yeah.
5043260	5043760	Nope.
5045260	5045740	The...
5046300	5047820	Spencer, Spencer.
5047820	5048940	Yeah, no, I was about to.
5049900	5053260	In the game of Dungeons and Dragons, you can take a 10 or a 20.
5053260	5056700	A 10 is when you have a short amount of time devoted to a task,
5056700	5059900	like if you're tying your shoes and you had 20 minutes, you could take a 10.
5060780	5062620	That'll give you a decent success rate.
5062620	5065100	If it's not very difficult, you'll automatically pass.
5065820	5069660	If you have plenty of time, like an hour or two, you can take a 20.
5069660	5073580	That means you automatically, as if you rolled a 20.
5073580	5077660	But you require a long period of time, and it can't be a task that you can fail at.
5077660	5079740	For instance, falling and slipping in a pile of acid.
5082860	5084220	I applaud your efforts, sir.
5085580	5088380	So is this a time to take a 20?
5089980	5092380	So if I take a 20, what's the consequence?
5092380	5097180	In this case, I'm going to rule you can't take a 20 because the stakes are life and death.
5097180	5099660	You don't have time to mess up and fix it.
5099660	5100700	Wait, I have a question.
5100700	5101580	Yeah, go for it.
5101580	5105340	Hypothetically, I have like a Ray O'Frost thing.
5105340	5107340	Because I listen to the podcast.
5107340	5114460	So can I try to cast a spell and build a bridge across the lava or whatever?
5114460	5114940	All right.
5114940	5115740	You can attempt it.
5115740	5117580	Ray O'Frost is a rather weak spell.
5117580	5118300	You have the best.
5118300	5120060	You can manage a meager bridge.
5120060	5121420	I'm not literate.
5121420	5122940	So that's fine.
5122940	5123820	There's tiny writing.
5123820	5125180	Where are my skills?
5125180	5126540	Your skills or your spells?
5126540	5127260	Dan, go help him.
5128460	5129100	Mentor him, man.
5129100	5130060	Do something, Dan.
5130700	5135660	Be a father to your child.
5135660	5137820	I'm so sorry.
5137820	5139820	It's like adaptation.
5139820	5140860	It's circular.
5140860	5145180	Dan, are you actually afraid of Ben a little bit?
5145180	5146700	Okay.
5146700	5151500	So here are your spells and your special abilities.
5151500	5153100	The spells are on a different page.
5155100	5157180	That back page is all your spells, man.
5157900	5159900	I'm helping.
5165420	5168860	So Aaron, you can't step.
5168860	5169740	He really is, Dan.
5169740	5170860	Here's a problem with a bit.
5170860	5172060	You can't, yes, Andrew.
5172060	5172540	Yeah, okay.
5172540	5173340	There's no need to.
5173340	5173900	Okay.
5173900	5174140	Okay.
5175820	5176300	All right.
5176300	5179980	So I'm actually, I've never looked at Sharpie's sheep before.
5179980	5181180	Yeah, you don't have spells.
5181980	5183180	No, I don't have spells.
5183180	5185740	Is there a way for me to make a bridge?
5185740	5187980	There is no way for you to make a bridge.
5187980	5189660	Okay, so there we go.
5189660	5193340	Spencer, I'm a plus nine for jump.
5193340	5194220	Yep.
5194220	5194700	Can I jump?
5196220	5198300	I try to jump across this expanse.
5198300	5198940	Okay.
5198940	5201020	The thing's 30 feet long.
5201020	5204540	Like you can jump over individual puddles, definitely, but I'm not sure.
5205580	5206140	Okay.
5206140	5210220	I'll say you can jump about 30% of the way.
5210220	5215660	Well, I jumped to the first lily pad of whatever that is.
5216620	5218620	You jump successfully.
5218620	5219180	All right.
5229180	5229660	Okay.
5229660	5230860	I have one more question.
5230860	5232060	Never had a lesson.
5232060	5238140	My future self from the future appeared to me and suggested I use Tenzer's floating disk.
5238140	5240460	It was possible for me to like put that ahead of...
5241820	5242300	Quark.
5242300	5243020	Quark.
5243100	5247100	So that when he next jumps, he can land on it and then like somehow move it again so that we sort
5247100	5248460	of hopscotch him across.
5248460	5253580	Yeah, if I were to advise that strategy, I'd put it right over one of those holes of acid
5253580	5256220	so like he could just like step lightly upon it.
5256220	5260380	So I cast Tenzer's floating disk.
5260380	5263740	Waving your hands in a magical manner, a shimmering disk appears.
5265020	5265580	Okay.
5265580	5267180	Ben, today you are a man.
5268460	5268940	Thank you.
5268940	5272060	Thank you.
5272060	5273500	This is your harmensva.
5277260	5277740	Trademark.
5280940	5281420	The quark.
5281420	5282380	The quark.
5282380	5283100	That's your name.
5283100	5283600	Yes.
5284620	5285500	Quark.
5285500	5287100	You see a Tenzer's floating disk.
5287900	5289420	I jump upon it.
5289420	5290460	You jump upon it.
5291100	5294060	You are upon a Tenzer's floating disk above a pile of acid.
5295100	5297180	Can I jump to the next place?
5299500	5303180	You are struck by a tentacle that whips out of a wall with a flash.
5303180	5303900	Shit.
5303900	5305580	It grabs you by the ankle.
5305580	5306860	I take an arrow.
5306860	5307900	You take an arrow.
5307900	5309580	I shoot the arrow at the tentacle.
5311020	5312780	He won't appreciate it, but I'll do it.
5314060	5314780	Critical hit.
5319420	5320140	Oh, thank you.
5321500	5323740	Yeah, because you shot one arrow.
5324540	5330140	Your arrow slices through the air, cleaving the tentacle in twain.
5331980	5335500	A quark is released, falling onto the Tenzer's floating disk.
5335500	5337420	Okay, I cast the thing against me, lands on it.
5337420	5338380	No, it's already there.
5338380	5339180	It's still there.
5339180	5339820	It just follows it.
5340780	5341900	So what's in front of me?
5341900	5343500	Can I jump to the end of the expanse?
5344700	5346140	You can jump most of the way.
5348700	5350300	Sounds like a bad idea.
5350380	5354780	Wait, is there a way for me to simultaneously move the thing forward
5354780	5356300	as he jumps so they're both in there at the same time
5356300	5359580	so he lands on it as he lands and then can then jump and finish?
5359580	5361820	You can move it with him on it without jumping.
5361820	5362940	Let's just do that.
5362940	5366700	Yeah, Sharpie, you move it.
5366700	5367980	I don't have to jump so much.
5367980	5368780	Okay, all right.
5370540	5371100	How about this?
5371100	5372540	You move it, I'll jump.
5372540	5375340	I'll wait until half of the movement and I'll jump the rest of the way.
5375340	5378380	Time it so that, can I just move it forward?
5378380	5379660	Right, also I have arrows.
5380300	5383260	I'm on it all the way there.
5383260	5383740	Say what?
5383740	5385260	I'm moving with him on it right there.
5385260	5386620	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5386620	5388940	He could just move, you could just move me all the way across, right?
5388940	5389740	With arrows.
5389740	5390540	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5390540	5393020	Hey, Ben, your dad's cool, right?
5396380	5397420	Just do it.
5397420	5398620	All right, yay.
5398620	5399580	Okay, cool.
5399580	5401260	Quark is across the passage.
5401260	5402220	I'm across the passage.
5403260	5404860	You see a large curtain of meat.
5404860	5405420	Thank you, sir.
5407180	5408540	But what about you guys?
5408540	5409580	What just happened?
5409580	5410220	Fuck them.
5410220	5416700	Can we, wait, can I, can we just like various back and forth with the floating disc?
5416700	5417180	Yep.
5417180	5424860	I said, I harness all of my training at Frisbee golf and I send the floating disc.
5424860	5426780	Yay, call it.
5426780	5428300	Back towards Sharpie and Mulrain.
5430140	5431660	You take five, hotshot.
5434060	5435100	That happens.
5435100	5436860	Okay, so they have the disc now?
5436860	5437340	Yeah.
5437340	5437820	All right.
5437820	5438860	We're floating across.
5439820	5441260	So, but they have to get on it.
5441260	5443820	I think Mulrain's still reduced, by the way.
5443820	5445500	Like you're short right now.
5445500	5447260	Okay, so then we both fit.
5447260	5448140	That's cool, right?
5448140	5448940	Yeah, it's fine.
5448940	5449820	I'm a little pocket.
5449820	5450940	Can you put me in your pocket?
5450940	5451900	Not that small.
5451900	5452380	Calm down.
5453340	5454380	You're quark sized.
5454380	5457660	But in any case, we're both small people because I'm young Dan Herman now.
5457660	5459660	Young Sharpie Butzalot now, so.
5459660	5464460	I don't know what game you're playing, but the time continuity marches on.
5464460	5465580	You're Sharpie Butzalot.
5465580	5467740	I jump on Sharpie's back.
5467740	5469340	Okay, and we go across.
5469340	5471020	Yeah, that happens.
5471660	5472060	Yay.
5472860	5473500	Are they across?
5473500	5474060	Are we all together?
5474060	5474620	They're across.
5474620	5475900	All right, so what are we looking at now?
5475900	5476700	A meat curtain.
5476700	5477420	A meat curtain.
5478540	5479580	Another meat curtain?
5479580	5479900	Yep.
5480380	5488300	I lube myself up and I gently insert myself inside the meat curtain.
5490060	5491260	Easing yourself in.
5494220	5495420	What word?
5495420	5496140	Cleave.
5496140	5496860	Cleave, okay.
5497020	5499340	I cleave the meat curtain.
5500620	5501500	No.
5501500	5503260	Easing yourself through the meat curtain.
5503260	5505740	You find yourself in a circular green room.
5506540	5510620	Three bluish holes mark the wall ahead of you.
5510620	5511820	Left, right, and center.
5513500	5514300	Are we all together?
5515500	5516940	No, it's just you right now.
5516940	5519900	Standing in the middle of the room is a strange tendril of flesh
5519900	5521340	sprouting out of the ground.
5521340	5524780	On the end of which is a large eye with a multicolored iris.
5524780	5527020	The eye sways back and forth ponderously.
5529900	5531500	That's not anatomy.
5532620	5535820	So I'm in a room right now inside the meat curtain chamber.
5535820	5536700	Three bluish holes.
5537660	5538620	Left, right, and center.
5538620	5541900	This is a giant tendril with a multicolored iris eye
5542540	5544460	swaying ponderously in front of you.
5544460	5545580	Yeah, ponderously.
5548060	5549020	Does it look like a foe?
5549820	5551260	It might very well be.
5551420	5555180	Well, I think it's, I invite the rest of the gang
5555180	5556940	and I yell through the meat curtain.
5556940	5557980	Everybody come on in.
5557980	5558700	The water's great.
5561900	5563740	We slickly slide through the meat curtain.
5564860	5565980	Slickly, you slide.
5567660	5570300	You too see the same thing that I mentioned earlier.
5572380	5574780	Can we, can we, do we try to communicate with it?
5574780	5575020	Yeah.
5575020	5576540	You have powers of charisma.
5577420	5580540	I'm like weirdly good at like, this is like, I understand.
5581100	5583900	I use diplomacy on the eyeball.
5585500	5586860	You don't speak the same language.
5586860	5587100	Fuck.
5589180	5591420	I should say it does not speak any language.
5592060	5593420	Oh, interesting.
5593980	5595980	When I used wild empathy?
5595980	5596620	Uh, yeah.
5597180	5598380	I do that.
5598380	5599660	You can't get a read on it.
5599660	5603180	Normally you tend to use body language to determine how an animal's feeling,
5603180	5606380	but this is a giant eyeball on a staff or a stock.
5606380	5607820	Sharpie, use one of your skills.
5610540	5611900	Shh, shh, shh, shh.
5611900	5617580	Wait, I can't make it sleep because we need to extrapolate information from it or something.
5617580	5621580	It shoots a blue bean, striking mole rain directly in the chest.
5624220	5625580	No, I.
5625580	5626780	You only take one damage.
5626780	5627260	Calm down.
5629260	5629740	All right, sorry.
5629740	5631100	Let me redo that sound effect.
5633900	5634700	Sleep.
5634700	5635180	Sleep?
5635180	5636060	Yeah, sleep eyeball.
5636060	5637580	He's entitled to a will save.
5638540	5639260	He passes.
5640620	5642060	He shrugs off the sleep.
5643260	5648460	All right, I'm going to have to do this and I try not to fly off in a rage,
5648460	5649980	but I go into a berserker rage.
5653180	5654700	I go into a berserker rage.
5654700	5657340	You hear the voice of Valisant in your ears.
5657340	5659340	Yes, use the rage.
5659340	5660780	Harness the rage.
5660780	5662780	Flaming sword!
5666940	5669260	You strike directly on the eyelid.
5670140	5672540	With a reflex, it manages to shut its eye.
5672540	5674060	So you haven't damaged its eye.
5674060	5678540	However, you do deal 11 damage.
5678540	5679260	11 damage.
5681660	5683660	Hey, Sharpie, really quick while we're alone.
5683660	5684540	Are we cool?
5684540	5685020	We're cool.
5687180	5687420	Okay.
5688220	5689260	Okay, okay, okay.
5690380	5693180	I'll buy you a bouquet of giant fish monster flowers.
5693180	5695020	Okay, sounds like you really understand women.
5695020	5695420	I do.
5697100	5698060	Look at the sweater.
5698060	5698940	Look at the sweater.
5700140	5704940	Is he still hitting the eye with the sword?
5704940	5706860	He's completed his strike.
5707500	5708940	It's your turn, Sharpie.
5708940	5709340	Sharpie.
5709340	5709580	Okay.
5711020	5711500	Scorching.
5711500	5712380	All right, thank you.
5712380	5717580	My Obi-Wan conscious appears to me once again in a ghostly haze to my, they're out of my vision.
5717580	5719100	It's not the voices again.
5719100	5720460	It's the ghostly conscious.
5720460	5722780	I, what?
5722780	5723900	Burning, burning Rey.
5724460	5725500	Scorching Rey.
5726220	5728140	Casting your arms in a magical manner.
5728780	5731260	Several bursts of fire streak forth.
5734300	5736140	They strike it directly in the stock.
5736780	5741580	It's engulfed in flames for a brief moment before taking five damage.
5742540	5743100	Five damage.
5743100	5744620	So it's got 16 hits right now.
5744620	5745100	Yep.
5745100	5745740	All right.
5745740	5746620	Maureen.
5746620	5747020	Yeah.
5747020	5747500	Nope.
5747500	5748460	Oh, shit.
5748460	5752460	The eye sways ponderously and its iris changes to green.
5752460	5752940	No.
5752940	5754300	Green.
5754300	5754620	Quark.
5755260	5762140	Even though you're in the throes of a barbarian rage, you can't help but stare longingly at the eye.
5762140	5762860	Uh-oh.
5762860	5765500	You find yourself compelled to attack your friends.
5766060	5766300	No.
5768300	5769340	I already rolled the will save.
5769340	5770060	He got a four.
5772140	5773100	Is he attacking us now?
5774460	5776380	Is there anything I can do in my defense?
5776380	5779180	You can attack the, you know, your friends.
5781100	5782540	I don't attack my friends.
5783180	5783660	All right.
5783660	5784700	Well, you kind of have to.
5785820	5786060	Wait.
5786060	5787180	I have to attack my friends?
5787180	5790620	You're being compelled by the magical eye to attack your friends.
5790620	5792140	It seems like a good plan.
5792140	5793180	I cast sleep.
5793180	5793980	Can I make him sleep?
5794860	5795900	You cast a spell.
5795900	5797980	It would be him, Maureen, and then you again.
5799260	5799820	What?
5799820	5802700	So it's Quark's turn, then Maureen, then you can cast a spell.
5802700	5805020	Oh, wait, but I don't want to attack my friends, right?
5805020	5809340	Well, that's the great thing about being charmed and compelled by otherworldly forces.
5809340	5810700	You could do things you don't want to.
5811660	5815500	I throw a portable hole in front of me and fall into it.
5815500	5817340	So I missed my attack.
5819580	5819820	No?
5820540	5821260	Roll dice.
5822460	5824060	You fall into a portable hole.
5831340	5833580	Two people just intercepted my air high five.
5836700	5837660	We're cool, Jeff.
5837660	5838460	All right, cool.
5838540	5840940	Maureen, go.
5842220	5859500	Gosh, well, I shoot an arrow that I still like looking around, right?
5859500	5859980	Yeah.
5859980	5861180	Can I use wild empathy?
5861180	5862060	No, I already did that.
5862060	5862460	Can I?
5862460	5863100	I'll shoot.
5863100	5864380	Gosh, I'm sorry, guys.
5865260	5871820	I shoot two arrows at the eye, one at the eyelid and one at the eyeball.
5871820	5875260	And as I'm shooting, I slow motion say, adventure!
5880300	5882060	Both of your arrows hit their mark,
5884060	5886140	dealing 13 damage to the eye.
5887580	5888220	Then I can...
5889340	5891980	I summon monster.
5891980	5893740	Okay, which monster would you like to summon?
5895340	5897020	Summon monster, thank you.
5897020	5897980	Summon monster, too.
5897980	5903500	I think last time you had a fiendish squid and a celestial bee.
5906700	5907260	Either one.
5909020	5911580	If you give me a second, I'll look up other things you can summon.
5914300	5915740	Wait, does the squid...
5915740	5917740	Does it then die in front of me?
5917740	5918060	Yeah.
5918060	5918700	Tragic.
5918700	5921980	Well, that's mean.
5923500	5924060	They love it.
5924380	5925740	Common moralities in flux.
5927740	5928620	Oh, is there a badger?
5932700	5933580	I'm waiting.
5933580	5936220	Is there like a cuddly furry animal?
5936780	5937900	I'm gonna say yes.
5937900	5938700	I'm gonna say...
5938700	5939900	Okay, so I...
5941580	5945820	Well, no, it makes sense because, you know, the animals never die.
5945820	5946460	They never...
5946460	5947660	You never kill the dog.
5948300	5949100	So that's...
5949100	5951500	In most media works, you know, they don't...
5952380	5953100	Yeah, okay.
5953100	5954300	Do I have that?
5954300	5954940	Do you have what?
5955580	5956380	A mannequin leg.
5956380	5956860	Nope.
5957500	5958220	Then...
5958220	5958860	What?
5958860	5959980	Okay, all right.
5959980	5961340	Well, then I summon badger.
5961340	5962940	Okay, you summon a dire badger.
5967100	5969100	Standing before you, the devi...
5969100	5972060	The devire badger waits for its orders.
5973580	5974780	We could take care of him.
5976700	5981340	The badger adorably hits the eye with its finger, tail, paw, bite.
5981980	5984140	It attempts to claw the eye, but fails.
5985980	5986540	All that.
5988460	5991180	Spencer, what does my power bracelet do?
5991180	5992700	It gives you plus two to strength.
5993420	5993900	I see.
5995500	5997420	What is hat of disguise?
5997420	6000140	It lets you disguise yourself as another humanoid.
6000860	6001740	That's not gonna work.
6003500	6005740	You feel compelled to attack your teammates.
6007180	6007580	Again?
6008220	6009420	Why do I keep doing that?
6009420	6011020	Because you're still compelled.
6011180	6011680	Oh.
6012540	6013180	I don't.
6015180	6017500	Seeing as how you're stuck in a pit, that works.
6017500	6017980	Okay, good.
6020780	6021340	Clef hanger?
6022860	6024620	That would put it at the eye stock's turn.
6025740	6026700	Nope, wrong dice.
6028300	6028780	Okay.
6029420	6033260	Its eyeball turns red and it stares directly at Sharpie.
6035180	6037980	It shoots a red gaze at you, but you shrug it off.
6041180	6041680	Good.
6043180	6043900	Whose turn is it?
6045260	6045900	Sharpies?
6045900	6046620	Sharpies, yeah.
6046620	6047100	Sorry, guys.
6047100	6047660	Oh, okay.
6047660	6051500	So I charm the small...
6052380	6052940	Quark.
6052940	6053660	Quark.
6053660	6054940	Yep, yep.
6054940	6055340	All right.
6055980	6060460	Quark can willingly fail his will save to be afflicted by your charm spell.
6060460	6062140	So he's back on your side.
6065660	6067340	Although still in a portable hole.
6067340	6074700	All right, I shoot two sleep arrows.
6074700	6076060	Two sleep arrows.
6076060	6076700	At the eye.
6077980	6081020	Both of the sleep arrows impact the creature.
6081020	6081500	All right.
6082620	6086300	You feel its eyes grow heavy and it falls to the ground.
6087740	6089020	Lilz, it's asleep.
6090060	6090540	It's asleep.
6090540	6091340	It's asleep, guys.
6091340	6092380	It's asleep.
6092380	6094300	Yay, I have a question.
6094300	6096220	Is she still reduced through all of this?
6096220	6096620	Yep.
6096620	6097180	Okay, cool.
6097340	6098620	I was just being bothered by that.
6098620	6099260	Power attack.
6100140	6101100	You're in a hole.
6101100	6101580	Huh?
6101580	6102220	You're in a hole.
6102780	6103740	I get out of the hole.
6103740	6105820	Ask someone to get you out of the hole.
6105820	6107820	Hey, Sharpie, a little help?
6107820	6108620	Get me out of the hole.
6108620	6109420	Yes, I...
6109420	6110060	Wait.
6110060	6111980	Just reach down and pull me out of the hole.
6111980	6112780	Yeah.
6112780	6114620	I reach down and pull him out of the hole.
6114620	6115580	Oh, I have a rope.
6116300	6117580	You pull him out of the hole.
6117580	6118140	All right.
6118140	6118620	Yay.
6119180	6121900	I take my sword, my great sword, and go into a power attack.
6122620	6123580	All right.
6123580	6125340	Automatically confirm critical hit.
6127820	6128300	Oh.
6131180	6133820	You deal 28 damage, severing the eye.
6136060	6136620	Excellent.
6137900	6139180	There could be only one.
6140620	6142460	I smell Sharpie's hair and smile.
6145100	6146700	It smells kind of like fish guts.
6146700	6149260	So do we kill the eye stock?
6149260	6150620	You killed the eye stock.
6150620	6151100	All right.
6154220	6155180	Do you want to pick like...
6155180	6159580	There's three paths if you want to pick or valescence around also.
6159580	6161260	Is now a good time for a cliffhanger?
6161260	6161740	Yeah.
6161740	6162460	Cliffhanger.
6164460	6165420	Spencer, everybody.
6170380	6173260	Let's have a hand for young Dan Harmon, Ben.
6175740	6176940	Whoa, Ben Harmon.
6178780	6179420	Thank you, sir.
6180700	6182140	Aaron McGathey, everybody.
6182140	6183180	Aaron McGathey.
6186060	6186700	Thank you, Ben.
6187420	6188220	What a good sport.
6193580	6203260	Ben, always respect women, and don't drink too much, and write drafts quickly.
6203260	6207420	Like, just get through a bad one first.
6207420	6209100	You can always rewrite it later.
6209100	6210700	Just trying to think of everything I do wrong.
6210700	6216140	It's a man who is requesting chicken noodle...
6216140	6216940	Chicken noodle man.
6216940	6218540	A chicken noodle dick, right?
6240700	6243100	Soup to the bowl, bowl to the spoon.
6243100	6245340	Spoon to the mouth, you're gonna get well soon.
6245340	6248220	You gotta get some bed rest sleep until noon.
6248220	6250540	Drink a cup of coffee, then head to the saloon.
6250540	6253180	Saying chicken noodle guy, come down from the mountain.
6253180	6255980	Saying chicken noodle man, you gotta work all day.
6255980	6257900	Chicken noodle man, you gotta cross the river.
6257900	6260780	Jordan, feed the devil soup until your troubles go away.
6260780	6263340	Well, the wind blows south, and come what may.
6263340	6265980	My chicken noodle wife, let me dress the other day.
6265980	6268380	There's not much else I can do but pray.
6268380	6271100	My chicken noodle man, you gotta work all day.
6271100	6273340	Chicken noodle guy, come down from the mountain.
6273340	6276220	Saying chicken noodle man, you gotta work all day.
6276220	6278140	Chicken noodle man, you gotta cross the river.
6278140	6280940	Jordan, feed the devil soup until your troubles go away.
6286780	6287900	Good, good request, sir.
6292620	6293100	Pringle stick.
6293100	6295180	Some people call me Pringle stick,
6295180	6297180	but I never really found out why.
6298620	6300780	I don't really have a Pringle's dick.
6300780	6303180	I just keep my dick inside.
6303180	6304300	Bo, bo, bo.
6304300	6306540	I keep my dick inside a Pringle's can
6306540	6308780	because it keeps my penis safe and dry.
6310220	6312380	Some people call me Pringle's dick,
6312380	6314060	but I never really found out.
6314060	6315660	No, I never found out.
6315660	6317340	I never really found out why.
6323100	6325260	We're becoming Van Halen minus the...
6325980	6326700	Play the hits.
6327580	6329580	Minus the body of work.
6330460	6331900	Pay them off.
6331900	6334700	Bo, bo, put my dick in a book.
6338700	6339500	All right.
6339500	6340940	What lessons have we learned?
6340940	6342540	What are you crying out?
6344380	6345340	Ragnarok?
6345340	6347020	It was a mama rap.
6347020	6347980	Oh, a mama rap.
6349020	6350700	I mean, I don't know.
6350700	6352780	If you guys are all caught up in the podcast history,
6352780	6356060	I'm getting worse and worse at rapping.
6357500	6360860	Partly because, you know, like my Uno cards of rhyming,
6360860	6363340	like mouth and south, we know that.
6364220	6365980	Balls, Niagara Falls.
6367340	6368780	Maybe that means you guys can help me out.
6368780	6369340	Maybe that's the...
6371580	6373900	There's a really good chance if I say mouth,
6373900	6375260	I'm probably going to say south.
6375260	6376140	Then don't say mouth.
6376140	6376780	Vice versa.
6376780	6377500	Don't say mouth.
6377500	6380540	But if I think twice about anything,
6380540	6381420	then it's all fucked.
6381900	6383660	Is anybody here an actual rapper?
6383660	6384860	Is anyone freestyle?
6384860	6385660	We're in Chicago.
6386460	6388940	This guy's a hand shadow.
6388940	6390140	He's got blonde Eminem hair.
6390140	6392140	He's got a little bit of an early Eminem look.
6393980	6394460	All right.
6396460	6397020	I'm totally...
6398060	6398540	What's your name?
6398540	6399020	Is it on?
6400140	6400620	There you go.
6400620	6401100	Sweet.
6401100	6402380	I'm totally bluffing, by the way.
6404380	6406460	I mean, do you want to give it a shot, though?
6406460	6407020	Yeah, I do.
6407020	6407660	Give me some...
6407660	6409340	Do you ever freestyle, or are you just both...
6409340	6409900	Sometimes.
6411180	6412700	Have you done it successfully?
6412700	6414940	They will turn on you like a fucking pit of vikers.
6414940	6415820	I don't care.
6415820	6418220	Like, they support people who come up earnestly.
6418220	6420700	Look, I'm a rapper who just blocks me on stage.
6420700	6421420	I love haters.
6421420	6421820	Okay, well...
6421820	6422300	Yeah.
6423180	6424060	Do it.
6424060	6424460	Show me some...
6424460	6424940	Booby.
6427820	6429420	Okay, you guys know the refrain to this.
6432380	6435420	Come on down to Harman Town.
6435420	6438380	Turn that frown upside down.
6438380	6441340	Peas yellow poop is brown.
6441340	6443900	Come on down to Harman Town.
6443900	6446140	Yo, Booby, because I fucked your mom.
6446140	6447820	I'm going to fuck her real hard,
6447820	6449820	and then I'm going to go to the store.
6449820	6452460	Buy some apples to put her on her face.
6452460	6453340	She's going to have a bee.
6455900	6457980	Put a fucker like she was a dog,
6457980	6459820	and then I'll be a hog.
6459820	6462380	She'll call me a pig, because I'm sexist,
6462380	6464460	but I don't even care.
6464460	6468060	You're Booby, but I'm not even scared of your hate,
6468060	6471100	because it's not my fate to be brought down by you.
6471100	6474380	I'm going to hit you in my face with my fucking shoe.
6474380	6476940	Come on down to Harman Town.
6476940	6479740	You bring back the frown upside down.
6479740	6480460	Might be a hero.
6480460	6483020	Peas yellow poop is brown.
6483020	6483420	Race.
6483420	6486220	Come on down to Harman Town.
6486220	6488300	On stage and doing a rap,
6488300	6490940	and it's kind of a piece of crap,
6490940	6491740	but that's fine.
6491740	6492620	I don't care.
6492620	6494140	I'm okay with it, guy.
6494140	6496300	And then look at me.
6496300	6500220	I'm fly like Superman in the sky real high,
6500300	6501820	but I don't have a cape,
6501820	6504300	because why don't I have a cape?
6504300	6504860	I don't know.
6504860	6506140	I should get a cape.

6600620	6603260	so maybe I should continue to do my thing.
6603260	6604220	Maybe not.

7118460	7119580	It's a good deal.
7125580	7126140	Hello.
7126140	7126940	I'm Kyle Ayers.
7126940	7130300	I'm the host of Never Seen It, the podcast where comedians rewrite
7130300	7133020	famous movies and TV shows they've never seen.
7133020	7135260	And then we give them a read in studio.
7135820	7138060	This is a clip I want to play for you guys from an episode
7138060	7141580	where Langston Kerman rewrites Scarface.
7141580	7143340	He's never seen it, but he wrote a script
7143340	7146060	based on what he thinks he knows about it.
7146060	7146860	And here's a clip.
7146860	7147420	Give it a listen.
7148060	7148620	All right.
7148620	7150380	Scarface, the new frontier.
7151180	7153980	Interior, happening discotheque.
7153980	7156620	Remember when we called clubs discotheques?
7156620	7159260	LOL, the 70s were crazy.
7159260	7159740	Night.
7160700	7163820	The crowd bustles with young, hot Mexicans
7163820	7165580	who are supposed to be Cuban.
7165580	7168860	And all are dressed in butterfly-collared shirts
7168860	7171100	and pants that look like jinko jeans
7171100	7173420	and pleated khakis had a really weird baby.
7174220	7177020	There's sex in the air and Poppy wants a whiff.
7178060	7179500	Oh, my God.
7181100	7183420	Scarface, 22 to 45.
7185420	7187580	He's a television audience demographic.
7188380	7190620	Devilishly handsome.
7190620	7192620	Not even a little bit Italian-looking.
7192620	7194940	So get that out of your dumb brain.
7194940	7197260	Walks to the crowd with the confidence of a man
7197260	7199900	who's going on MTV Cribs with a yin-yang twin.
7201740	7204060	Does he actually have a scar on his face?
7204060	7205020	Fuck no.
7205020	7207100	Why would you even ask that?
7207100	7208220	That's not important.
7208220	7210300	What's important is that he is not at all
7210300	7212300	a problematic stereotype
7212300	7214620	and that he has come for his cocaine.
7214620	7215900	Oh, my God.
7215900	7218780	As he approaches the red rope of the VIP,
7218780	7221180	pronounced vey-ay-pay in Spanish.
7221180	7222620	Oh, my God.
7223260	7224700	He spots his dear friend
7224700	7227020	who is almost certainly going to become his enemy
7227020	7228460	by the end of the film.
7228460	7229340	Smooth skin.
7230060	7232460	Scarface yells out his signature line.
7234220	7235180	Ciao, Bella.
7235180	7235980	It's Amelia.
7235980	7236620	Scarface.
7237500	7238300	Oh, my God.
