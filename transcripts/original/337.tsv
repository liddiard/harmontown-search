0	20320	What's good, MacArthur Park?
20320	21520	I'll tell you what's extra good.
21520	23800	I got very good news for you.
23800	30680	Carmen Town is now in session.
30680	36680	We've got guests, we've got, there's a dog act coming out, we've got all sorts of stuff.
36680	39640	But let's start with the important ingredients.
39640	45160	Your game master, your friend, your mentor and guru, Spencer Crittenden.
45160	49640	What up, Spencer?
50640	54920	What up, Spencer?
54920	56920	What up?
56920	57920	Indeed.
57920	59920	How about let's bring out a mayor.
59920	62360	It ain't a town without a mayor.
62360	70440	We have a mayor's name is Dan Harmon.
70440	72440	Hello.
72440	79440	Hello, like I'm voting now, I'm a new man, I'm a new, okay sorry, I'm so excited about
79440	80440	our guests.
80440	82360	I was like, do I have to go do the show?
82360	86680	I keep talking to my guests, but I'll talk to her out here.
86680	89240	It's been a while, thanks you guys for coming.
89240	90440	We've been apart for a while.
90440	91440	I missed you.
91440	92440	Yeah.
92440	95600	I heard you've been having pee pee trouble.
95600	101200	Yeah, I got what appears to be some kind of bladder infection.
101200	103360	It's all right, it's all right.
103360	106520	I did what I had to do to get the meds today.
107480	115480	This morning, I was like, you ladies know I was already a feminist.
115480	122880	But boy golly, these UTIs, like I now, as if I needed more reason to respect what you
122880	127080	go through, Jeff, statistically, women get more UTIs than men.
127080	128200	I knew that.
128200	130480	Their pee holes are closer to their butt holes.
130480	132760	That's not why, Dan, that's not why.
132760	136960	Also the other side of the gender spectrum is a horrendous filthy animal that always
136960	137960	plunges.
137960	143040	There's a million reasons, but they get more UTIs.
143040	149840	If you had described to me on paper, oh, there's a thing where you feel like you have to take
149840	155080	a pee really bad, but all the time forever.
155080	162000	No matter how much you pee, you keep feeling like you have to pee, I'd be like, grow up.
162000	164440	That's not even a disease.
164440	166200	That sounds fun.
166200	170440	I'd pay money to experience that at like a theme park.
170440	172680	That sounds like an escape room to me.
172680	173680	Bring it on.
173680	178160	I'd love to feel what it feels like to have to pee all the time.
178160	185080	I experienced it for three hours this morning, and I was like, Rick and Morty's canceled.
185080	190720	I'm going to kill myself, and I'm going to take the gun that I reassembled after I bought
190720	196080	it, and I don't even have to point it at my head to kill myself, because as we established,
196080	202160	it's probably poorly reassembled by a liberal, and it'll just blow up in my hand, and I'll
202160	207600	bleed out, because I don't know how to do anything, at least if I'll handle a UTI.
207600	212800	My intrepid assistant, Steve Levy, did exactly what I commanded him to do, which is I don't
212800	219840	care what you have to do, find me a doctor that will look at my dick today immediately,
219840	220840	and he found one.
220840	223120	I know a couple.
223120	225440	God bless this guy's heart.
225440	233200	If you're going to see a doctor same day, you're not seeing the same doctor that...
233200	238320	They're not sending their best.
238320	244880	The medical community is sending their best in the sort of Katrina sandbag sense of whether
244880	253920	they're like, you're going to end up in an office with somebody that's like, this guy
253920	257800	gave me a whole speech after he asked me about my dick for a bunch of times.
257800	258800	It was really heartwarming.
258800	263080	It was like, by the way, I know you have another doctor and you're here because I was the one
263080	266960	that could see right away, but the thing is, if you didn't want to be, I don't know, it's
266960	273480	sort of like a courtship thing, but not because he wasn't trying to swindle me into being
273480	274480	his patient.
274480	276560	He just weren't telling me in a really sweet way.
276560	281280	He's like, look, if it's a Monday, a Wednesday, or a Friday, and it's between these hours,
281280	283360	you can walk in here, ask any of my other patients.
283360	286400	If you're the first one in, you're the first one I'll see.
286400	289600	Those other three days, I'm working in urgent care.
289600	290600	I do this all I say.
290600	294720	He's just like, you're a little sweetheart, you're a little sweetheart, but you don't
294720	297200	care about my dick.
297200	302040	Not in the way that a guy who spent three hours in discomfort and who WebMD'd it.
302040	303480	I know exactly what I want.
303480	309400	I'm like, bitch, I gave you a cup of pee.
309400	311200	Here's what you're going to do.
311200	313400	You're going to analyze it.
313400	315540	Tell me what beasties are in it.
315540	317760	He dipped a thing in it, and he's like, there's blood in your urine.
317760	320120	I'm like, visibly to the naked eye?
320120	321680	He's like, no, I put a thing in it.
321680	323200	I'm like, okay.
323200	324200	So talk to me.
324200	325600	You have blood in the pee pee?
325600	330880	Yeah, there's blood in the pee pee, but only detectable by a litmus strip, not visible
330880	331880	blood.
331880	335960	I'm not blood urine shaming anyone out there who has visible blood in their urine.
335960	340440	I'm down with everyone.
340440	341440	I went in and I'm like.
341440	345160	I think this show's gotten off to a zooming start.
345160	349080	I told the guy, I'm like, the guy goes, look, how old are you?
349080	352080	I'm like, I don't know.
352080	353600	A million years old.
353600	355280	I'm a million years old.
355280	356680	I know what questions are coming next.
356680	358720	By the way, they ask you, you go and you fill the forms.
358720	359720	Come on.
359720	360720	I don't want to complain about this.
360720	361720	Sometimes they look at the forms.
361720	362720	They don't want to look at the forms.
362720	363720	They don't look at the forms.
363720	369520	Not only don't they look at the forms, even the people that don't look at the forms, they
369520	375240	don't even talk to the people that haven't yet looked at the forms and they, and even
375240	381080	though they ask you the same fucking questions, they're not, I don't even think they're writing
381080	382080	them down.
382080	385560	It seems like it would be a great step to look at those forms before it comes in and
385560	386560	talks to you.
386560	394240	The forms, my address is on your fucking clipboard a thousand times, and two orderlies
394240	397720	came in and were like, yeah, well, is your dad divorced?
397720	400720	Does he have a fungus in his foot?
400720	403120	I watched the data get shuffled.
403120	404960	The doctor eventually was like, and when did your dad die?
404960	407480	I'm like, he never died.
407480	409640	You guys just keep asking the same questions.
409640	412800	I'm trying to answer them as fast as possible.
412800	413800	Two parents.
413800	415600	I got some brothers and sisters.
415640	417040	I don't smoke anymore.
417040	418120	I drink a lot.
418120	419440	I never hydrate.
419440	421960	I'm a fucking walking time bomb.
421960	424720	My dick burns.
424720	429200	I read on the internet it probably means I got some UTI.
429200	430200	All right.
430200	431200	It's true.
431200	435480	So the guy was like, but the guy was like, he's like, he's like, yeah, you know, hey,
435480	436480	you know, what are you?
436480	441600	It sounds like you drink a lot more coffee than you used to and you never had any water
441600	448080	since like Clinton and like, you know, he's always the rules, you know, he's a good guy
448080	452560	and he's like, if we were in a world of socialized medicine, this is the guy you want because
452560	455680	he's not going to immediately prescribe me something, right?
455680	457000	I want the prescription.
457000	458960	My dick hurts.
458960	465640	But he's like, you know, come on, you're 46, you know, so much coffee, you know, sometimes
465640	467120	you irritate your bladder.
467120	469760	Is your doctor Benincio del Toro?
469760	470760	Yeah.
470920	471920	So I go, okay.
471920	472920	All right.
472920	473920	That sounds great, doctor.
473920	474920	But what is it?
474920	481600	Is there an antibiotic that like if I took it and I didn't have a bacterial infection
481600	484720	in my dick hole, would it kill me?
484720	485720	No.
485720	487240	Do you want you want that?
487240	488840	Yes, I do.
488840	489840	Yeah.
489840	490840	Yeah.
490840	491840	Is there anything?
491840	495760	How many tests can you run on the cup of pee I gave you with my broken dick?
495760	497800	Well, we could do this.
497800	498800	Do them all.
498800	499960	I'm not going to know them by name.
499960	500960	Do them all.
500960	501960	Is there a lab?
501960	502960	Yes.
502960	503960	There's a lab upstairs.
503960	504960	Let's send it to the lab.
504960	505960	Well, that's kind of funny.
505960	506960	Yeah.
506960	507960	I don't send it.
507960	508960	I'd send the pee to everything.
508960	510880	Give me all the shit.
510880	515440	And then as I was walking out, I'm like, by the way, is this the shit you scribbled on
515440	520800	a fucking magic thing that's going to make the thing downstairs give me a bottle of pills?
520800	524520	Is that the thing that makes your pee orange that also makes you not feel like you have
524520	525520	to pee?
525520	526520	Oh, no, no.
526520	527520	That's just a painkiller.
527520	528520	Do you want that too?
528520	529520	Yes.
530080	531080	Okay.
531080	533560	Can I be a doctor now?
533560	536080	I did so much today.
536080	537880	I did so much diagnosis.
537880	540160	I sent so many things to so many labs.
540160	541960	I diagnosed myself.
541960	543280	I prescribed myself.
543280	544880	I gave myself a prognosis.
544880	547520	By the way, I've got like five years left to live.
547520	553000	Like I did a, can I just, can I have more money?
553000	556160	That's like a lot of people have that unfortunate experience.
556160	559600	They call it like you got to be your own health advocate or some such, which just
559600	561720	means like the doctor don't give a fuck.
561720	562720	Yeah.
562720	566640	But I do think, I mean, I walked out of there thinking like I wanted to be outraged, but
566640	569560	then I gave it a second thought and I was like, well, wait a minute.
569560	576320	You'd be, you'd be more outraged if you're Beverly Hills doctor, like, uh, if you went
576320	580840	in with an itchy dick and he was like, well, just to be careful, we should do all these
580840	582000	eight million things.
582000	583000	Right.
583000	584000	You'd be outraged for that reason.
584000	585000	Yeah.
585000	588760	So I have a doctor who's pretty good about like just being like, Hey, I think, I think
588760	591400	I need a cough syrup and it'll be like, Oh, okay.
591400	596160	If you say so, it feels great because I just like, I just go in, it's like a store.
596160	597160	It did feel like a gateway.
597160	602480	It was like, like, like when you realize in, uh, in Stardew Valley that you can build the
602480	607000	greenhouse, you know, it was like, Oh shit, I can grow like cantaloupe in the winter.
607000	608560	Can I, that's a big, it's good.
608560	609560	Oh, sorry.
609560	611960	Can I tell you something that happened to me about three days ago?
611960	612960	That's pretty important to me.
612960	613960	All right.
613960	614960	Okay.
614960	616760	So you're going through some medical woes right now.
616760	617760	Yeah.
617760	619880	Well, before I go on, are you feeling better or are you recovering?
619880	620880	I feel great.
620880	621880	I'm done.
621880	624400	I'm on some weird pill that makes your piss orange and like makes you never feel like
624400	625640	you have to pee.
625640	629520	I might be pissing my pants right now with orange piss.
629520	630520	Yes.
630520	635080	Well, you should always wear blue pants because they're complimentary colors and you have.
635080	636080	So well done.
636080	637080	All right.
637080	638080	Tell us what you got.
638080	639080	Um, I went to a wedding.
639080	641440	I was invited by, uh, mutual friends of lots of people here.
641440	646840	Shannon and I and leather people are, uh, Jesse Schwartz invited to a celebrity wedding
646840	647840	on the Isle of Catalina.
647840	650040	It was a three day affair.
650040	654100	And I thought, if we're going to do this, let's do it right and let's take the chopper.
654100	655800	Let's take the helicopter out of San Pedro.
655800	660000	I've been to Catalina many times, always took the boat.
660000	661000	The boat is all right.
661000	665200	I like the boat, but, uh, let's take the chopper.
665200	667840	So we get to the San Pedro chopper place.
668440	670560	It's not what it's called.
670560	677040	Uh, and we, we, they get our bags and these two young guys who are certainly high, uh,
677040	678040	they were late.
678040	681560	I called up my travel legend, our travel legend, I'm like, there's nobody here.
681560	685480	And she got in line with the people and they're like, they like to take a late lunch.
685480	690800	These two dudes come in, young guys, and they have burgers and burritos and they're stoned.
690800	691800	They like to take a late lunch.
691800	697360	And then my first question was, you guys aren't the pilots, I hope, and they're like, uh, yeah,
697360	698480	your chopper will be here in a minute.
698480	699480	He's coming in.
699480	700560	We're like, okay.
700560	705900	So the chopper comes in, they take our bags, we're walking out there and it's a big ass
705900	706900	chopper there.
706900	708200	And it's, it's exciting.
708200	709720	I like helicopters.
709720	714000	And the guy holding my bag says, he turns to us and says, Hey, uh, have you guys ever
714000	717120	seen the, uh, the musical movie grease?
717120	721160	Wait, wait, is that how we phrased it?
721160	723480	Have you ever seen the musical movie grease?
723480	724480	I certainly hope so.
724800	728880	Have you guys ever read the novelization back to the future?
728880	730880	He said, have you ever seen grease?
730880	731880	The movie, the musical.
731880	732880	He said he laid it out.
732880	733880	Okay.
733880	737360	I wanted to be certain that he doesn't want to know if I saw it like off Broadway.
737360	741840	As a helicopter pilot, he's aware that the geographic ambiguities as well.
741840	742840	Have you ever seen grease?
742840	743840	Who will listen to me?
743840	744840	Yes.
744840	747160	He's, this guy's not taking you to Greece.
747160	751480	This fellow is the guy that's giving us, uh, given us a very, uh, quick safety instruction
751480	756400	and is now taking our bags out to the chopper, which is on the pad and the, and the, the,
756400	757400	the whirlies are birding.
757400	760800	I don't know how you say it and, uh, I'm excited.
760800	761800	Jesse's excited.
761800	766680	We're, we're, we're going on a trip, uh, to a celebrity wedding and, uh, and, uh, he's
766680	767680	going to be there.
767680	768680	It's going to be great.
768680	769680	Whatever wedding you would do.
769680	771640	I hope they're proud of being a celebrity wedding.
771640	773280	I want, I want to have a celebrity wedding.
773280	774280	Oh wait, I did.
774280	777280	And then I got divorced.
777280	778280	All right.
778280	779280	Don't have a celebrity wedding.
779280	780280	They're not, they don't.
780280	781280	Okay.
781280	782280	It was a fancy pants wedding.
782280	783280	I'll say that at least.
783280	784280	So we're going to go out there fancy pants style.
784280	789560	And now here's this beautiful, like F star or four star or something star chopper.
789560	790960	And the guy goes, have you ever seen Greece?
790960	791960	The movie.
791960	792960	Like, yeah.
792960	796520	And he goes, your pilot is Lorenzo Lamas.
796520	801160	Wait, what the fuck?
801160	802560	That's what I said.
802560	807680	And so I freak out because I don't know if it's a beauty school dropout, uh, no, no,
807680	809080	he, he has, he has no lines.
809080	813280	He plays a jock in it at the end of it, but he's also renegade the TV show in the nineties.
813280	814280	Yeah.
814280	816560	He's a golden globe winner from Falconcrest.
816560	820720	I guess most importantly, he's the guy that Billy Crystal is doing an impression of when
820720	822160	he says you look marvelous.
822160	823160	That's Fernando Lamas.
823160	824160	Oh, okay.
824160	825160	Who's his dad?
825160	826160	Lorenzo Lamas.
826160	827160	No, he was okay.
827160	828160	Okay.
828160	834240	He was, he, he, he, uh, yeah, he, he was in like weird, like, uh, yeah, he had a talking
834240	835240	spaceship.
835240	837440	He was never talking spaceship, but I'm sure he did.
838200	844920	A lot of people back then did, and I believe renegade turned in crooked cops and they framed
844920	845920	him for murder.
845920	850200	So he and a native American and a woman go off just to kind of set the record straight.
850200	853000	My favorite show, favorite show.
853000	854000	You never saw.
854000	855080	I want to know nothing more about it.
855080	861080	I want, I, I just love that it's three people instead of either two or five and a native
861080	866000	American and a woman that I'm already like in show you, I'm going to show you because
866000	867000	it's three people.
867000	868480	So it's always going to be kind of weird.
868480	872520	I did a screen grab while we, while we took the lift here, I have a screen grab of the
872520	877480	poster or like the ad, the billboard ad for renegade and this is going to ring some bells
877480	878480	for you.
878480	879480	Dan.
879480	880480	Uh, this is important.
880480	881480	Yeah.
881480	882480	I'm remembering now.
882480	883480	I realized the Lamas.
883480	884480	Yeah.
884480	885480	Oh yeah.
885480	886480	He was a man.
886480	887480	That is.
887480	889800	We'll put it on the social media.
889800	890800	Okay.
890800	895280	So he, you were hanging out with him.
895280	896280	Okay.
896280	897280	He flew.
897280	898280	Yeah.
898280	899280	He flew.
899280	900280	He's the fucking captain.
900280	901280	So we get on the, we get in the chopper.
901280	902280	There's three in the back.
902280	903280	I'm one.
903280	904280	And there's two other, like another young couple.
904280	907960	It's just a weird thing, but I'm sorry to cut you up, but I will talk about this for
907960	908960	the rest of the show.
908960	909960	First time on a helicopter.
909960	910960	Yeah.
910960	911960	So here's the thing.
911960	912960	Like, keep your head down when you get in.
912960	914400	Cause there's a thing on top that'll cut your head off.
914400	916400	Um, I'm going to tighten your seatbelt real quick.
916400	917960	Hey, by the way, do you like dentistry?
917960	918960	Yeah, I do.
918960	919960	Your pilot's a dentist.
919960	920960	Bye.
920960	925160	I like, don't, I don't leave me with that thought.
925160	927240	I don't care how good a dentist he was.
927240	932520	I think this guy saw that I was over 40 and might know who Lorenzo Lamas is.
932520	933520	All right.
933520	937680	I mean, I guess he's also seen a bunch of helicopters that didn't go down.
937680	941760	So he's comfortable just being like, Hey, here's a trivial thing.
941760	947920	Your pilot, not his first calling, but it is later.
947920	951640	Mine's tightening seatbelts and doing trivia by famous people.
951640	954240	Famous people love being pilots for some reason.
954840	955840	This is his new love.
955840	957280	I read up on it today.
957280	959200	He loves flying choppers.
959200	962960	He flies through the Grand Canyon to fly over New York City.
962960	963960	But he's decided.
963960	965600	You're not even supposed to fly through the Grand Canyon.
965600	968280	He sounds like a terrible pilot.
968280	969720	That's the lowest altitude.
969720	970960	It's lower than the ground.
970960	972040	He's technically crashing.
972040	974600	He found the only place he can do that without crashing.
974600	975600	Because he's fucking Lorenzo Lamas.
975600	979840	He's throwing what's called a helicopter tantrum through the Grand Canyon.
979840	982360	What you're technically doing is crashing and living.
982360	987720	We hop on board and we get in the thing and I'm in the backseat with two others.
987720	994240	Jesse is in the front seat and you get the headset with the microphone and he's talking
994240	995240	to the tower.
995240	998440	You can hear all the chatter on your headset, all the radio communications and we can all
998440	999440	hear each other.
999440	1003360	I coughed into it by accident and everybody could hear me cough.
1003360	1010000	So we get up in the air and I go, Are you Captain Lamas?
1010000	1011640	And he goes, Yes, I am.
1011640	1012640	I go, It's nice to meet you.
1012640	1013640	He goes, Ask him.
1013640	1014640	It's nice to meet you.
1014640	1016520	So he's got shorts on.
1016520	1019320	He's tan and he's fucking beautiful.
1019320	1025360	He's absolutely beautiful and I was just hoping that Jesse would just give him like a handy,
1025360	1031680	like something, like make it, make this count and he's flying and all I want to do is ask
1031680	1038840	Fernando Lamas questions and I got the comm on and I was like, Hey, what kind of aircraft
1038840	1039840	are flying here, Captain?
1039840	1043600	And he's like, It's a Death Star and I don't know, something like that.
1043600	1044600	It's a Death Star.
1044600	1045600	It's a Death Star.
1045600	1047120	And we're going and you're right over the deck.
1047120	1050720	It's Jurassic Park with the thing without the pelicans flying alongside and we're going
1050720	1053240	along and I just, I'm dying.
1053240	1054920	I got to talk to him.
1054920	1062640	And the only thing I said to him, the whole flight was said, Hey, Captain, yeah.
1062640	1063640	What's our altitude?
1064640	1072120	And he goes, 500 and that was it and then we landed and I thought maybe we get a fucking
1072120	1076680	picture with Fernando, Fernando, Lorenzo Lamas and he will come out and like, he knows that
1076680	1081200	we all want to photo with him because he's clearly aware that I'm a fan or at least I
1081200	1084480	just want to interrupt with one thing because it's important because I want to support your
1084480	1085480	recovery.
1085480	1090560	That's the, Jeff just told a celebrity story that didn't end with the celebrity thanking
1090560	1091560	him for talking to him.
1091560	1092560	Well, not yet.
1092880	1093880	The exact opposite.
1093880	1094880	That's so brave for you.
1094880	1095880	Oh yeah.
1095880	1096880	This is hard.
1096880	1100600	That was just an unremarkable encounter with a celebrity and you just took the L.
1100600	1102640	This is not easy for me.
1102640	1103640	We land.
1103640	1104720	He is a beautiful land.
1104720	1107120	He landed on a dime and gave you some change.
1107120	1115240	And then that's a, that is a really accurate helicopter landing that's, and then we get
1115240	1118440	out and they go, you got to run off and then take off your safety harness thing.
1118440	1121520	You get like a little safety pack around you in case you die.
1121520	1126720	And he instantly just goes, both right out.
1126720	1127720	It's like, I'm sorry.
1127720	1129400	Angie Harmon's on the set of Rizzoli Island.
1129400	1133080	Yeah, but also he has to go solve the burden that he was framed for.
1133080	1134400	Like it's, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1134400	1135400	You don't know.
1135400	1136400	That is just good shit.
1136400	1138720	And I, I'm still not over it.
1138720	1142880	Lorenzo Lamas flew me to, to Catalina Island.
1142880	1146400	I mean, I would be talking about that for a long time.
1146400	1147400	Let's bring out.
1147400	1148400	These kids seem to agree.
1148400	1150320	Let's bring out Brandon Johnson, everybody.
1150320	1151320	Brandon Johnson.
1151320	1152320	All right.
1152320	1153320	Where's my music?
1153320	1154320	Yeah.
1154320	1155320	And let's escalate things.
1155320	1156320	But first, Brandon, how's it going?
1156320	1169840	How's your, what's it like doing a voice on the Simpsons for like 40 years?
1169840	1173440	You know, they, they decided let's just, let's blow it out with a little Brandon Johnson
1173440	1174440	talent.
1174440	1175440	And guess who's disappointed?
1175440	1176440	How is it going?
1176440	1180040	It's good to have you back.
1180040	1181040	It's good to be here.
1181040	1182320	I just stopped by to see what you guys were up to.
1182320	1184440	Uh, there was a chance Jeff was going to be late.
1184440	1186880	So I stood, I stood on the circle.
1186880	1192760	I stood on deck just in case, because I was taking the boat back and, uh, Patrick Swayze
1192760	1193760	is dead.
1193760	1194760	He's dead.
1194760	1200400	Hey, look, man, dead men tell no tales.
1200400	1201400	That's the problem.
1201400	1202400	He was on a ghost ship.
1202400	1203400	I'm sorry.
1203400	1204400	That's it.
1204400	1205400	It's import taste.
1205400	1206400	He's a beloved actor that probably.
1206400	1207400	All right.
1207400	1210320	It's funny you say that because I did the exact same joke as someone said, no, he's
1210320	1211320	dead.
1211320	1212320	I did the same joke.
1212320	1213320	Really?
1213320	1214320	Is this like in our iCloud?
1214320	1217960	That's the guy that would be pilot Patrick Swayze too.
1217960	1219840	I think I meant Patrick Stewart.
1219840	1224880	I, I was, we should have kind of like, like Morgan Freeman, anybody like, no, he's too
1224880	1228040	a, he's too a level where you need that B ish level.
1228040	1230080	Uh, anyway, Brandon, how's it going?
1230080	1231080	It's so good.
1231080	1232080	But let's, I know what you're saying.
1232080	1233080	Let's get to it.
1233080	1234080	Right.
1234080	1235080	Let's just get to it.
1235080	1236080	Yeah, I feel it.
1236080	1237080	Y'all know me.
1237080	1238080	It's good to see you.
1238080	1239080	But yeah, let's get to it.
1239080	1240080	I really am enamored with our guest.
1240080	1241080	Let's get to it.
1241080	1243160	I want her to remember this as a, as a powerful time, but that's also not going to affect
1243160	1244160	my behavior.
1244160	1246480	Like for instance, I'm going to, I'm not going to get shitfaced before the show and then
1246480	1247560	fumble everything.
1247560	1253520	Um, but I, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, look, I, this is a, this is the story of a person who was
1253520	1257600	being made fun of, uh, from childhood for, uh, her voice.
1257600	1264680	And then, uh, uh, through no, uh, uh, seeking of her own ended up, uh, becoming incredibly
1264680	1266820	famous for that exact same voice.
1266820	1270760	And I would imagine, although we haven't asked her yet, I, I almost think that that voice
1270760	1276800	like may prohibit her from being in like your average like movies now that are all made
1276800	1277800	from CG.
1277800	1281400	Maybe that's one thing we'll ask her about, but gotta be one of the most famous voices
1281400	1284760	we've, we've, we, you'll ever hear.
1284760	1290220	But also an incredible person happens to be the, the, the connection here is that she,
1290220	1295200	she makes like this incredibly gourmet true crime podcast, Dan, we hate true crime.
1295200	1296200	We hate that you're into it.
1296200	1298080	Fuck off.
1298080	1301560	It's actually, it's actually a show you'd love if you weren't into true crime.
1301560	1304740	Also she's, she's, she's, she, her, look, let me put it this way.
1304740	1309380	Her Wikipedia page, I'd trade it in a second.
1309380	1311620	It's a good Wikipedia page.
1311620	1313800	It's the kind you'd want.
1313800	1319300	If a safe fell on your head and you have her Wikipedia page, you'd love it.
1319300	1322600	But all I'm going to do is ask her questions about maximum overdrive.
1322600	1331200	Please welcome actress, writer, performer, activist, stateswoman, hopefully new friend,
1331200	1332200	Yardley Smith.
1332200	1358920	Anywhere you were like, yeah, yeah, oh yeah, yeah, you can move my, the metaphor for my
1358920	1363240	eclipsing alcoholism.
1363240	1365400	Is there any room for this table to have function?
1365400	1369440	No, there's not.
1369440	1373520	In its place, my awareness.
1373520	1380840	So let's, I want to start with your upbringing because I did go through your Wikipedia page
1380840	1381840	a little bit.
1381840	1382840	First of all, thank you for coming.
1382840	1383840	Who writes those?
1383840	1387720	I don't know who writes them collectively, a swarm, a swarm.
1387720	1392720	It's so weird, and it's weird that you can't go in and edit them yourself.
1392720	1395080	I bet you could, if you really wanted to.
1395080	1396080	No, you can't.
1396080	1397080	No, you can't.
1397080	1398080	I've tried, actually.
1398080	1399320	I've tried to get some stuff off there forever.
1399320	1400320	Right?
1400320	1401320	Oh, really?
1401320	1402920	No, I don't know how it's run.
1402920	1406040	There's things on there that just really shouldn't be there.
1406040	1407880	It's 100% true.
1407880	1411480	Because you used to be the Sultan of Brunei.
1411480	1412480	I did.
1412480	1413480	Yes.
1413480	1416640	And I tried to say it's no longer relevant, and they're like, fuck off.
1416640	1417640	I'm keeping it.
1417640	1418640	What is that?
1418640	1419640	It's not true.
1419640	1422240	But do you ever look at yours?
1422240	1426160	I haven't in a very long time.
1426160	1427160	You know what's funny?
1427160	1432880	I was reading an article in Vanity Fair or something, and it was an old archived article,
1432880	1439880	and it said that, I think it was actually about Jennifer Lopez, and Jennifer Lopez was
1439880	1443560	saying, oh, I never read interviews about myself, and the interviewer was saying in
1443560	1450080	parentheses, PS celebrities always say that, and they always read interviews about themselves.
1450080	1451240	That's actually not true.
1451240	1453880	It's not true.
1453880	1455680	I don't read interviews about myself.
1455680	1458520	I rarely listen to interviews I give.
1458520	1459880	I never read reviews anymore.
1459880	1461760	I don't read the good or the bad.
1461760	1463560	It just doesn't help me.
1463560	1464560	It's very odd.
1464560	1468120	It's odd to be objectified in that way, and it can really fuck you up.
1468120	1470520	Well, the profit wears off.
1470520	1471720	It can only get you so high.
1471720	1472720	Yes.
1472880	1473880	You're a responsible person.
1473880	1475760	You're like, oh, I can only go down.
1475760	1480440	I think if you're healthy and you're privileged enough to be famous for a certain amount of
1480440	1484840	time, I would expect it to top off, where you're like, I'm not looking at any of it,
1484840	1488920	but it has the weird effect of like, oh, I hate my own name.
1488920	1492920	I can't like, oh, I go to YouTube, and I'm like, I wish I knew how to build a model airplane,
1492920	1494440	and they're like, yeah, but you're Dan Harmon.
1494440	1496440	Don't you want to read why Rick and Morty sucked in season three?
1496440	1497440	I'm like, no, I don't.
1497440	1498440	No, I don't.
1498840	1504640	Anything about any, anything that has anything to do with my name and my, sorry, I shouldn't
1504640	1505640	do all the talking.
1505640	1506640	I'm a bad interviewer.
1506640	1507640	You're going to find that out.
1507640	1508640	That's not true.
1508640	1512120	I do actually want to know how you came up with Rick and Morty, because it seems like
1512120	1513120	a fantastic.
1513120	1515120	Boy, don't get me started.
1515120	1516120	It's a grave.
1516120	1518760	Yardley, you've made a grave error here.
1518760	1522400	You know goddamn well how we did, because you know the show you work on rips it off every
1522400	1523400	week.
1523400	1524400	No, I want to talk.
1524400	1527800	It's an imitation, the most sincerest form of flattery, isn't that what they say?
1527800	1531400	I did want to say to you though, because as I was reading your Wikipedia page at the
1531400	1537040	bar before the show, I'm like, I want, I bet this person doesn't look at her Wikipedia
1537040	1543040	page, because I bet she's very healthy, and I bet she deserves to know this is an immaculate
1543040	1544040	Wikipedia page.
1544040	1545040	Oh.
1545040	1551080	You, it like, just when you think, what a nice person, what a good solid person, right
1551080	1552080	at the end.
1552080	1553520	Does it say I'll turn on you?
1553520	1559080	It's like, no, right at the end, it's like, oh by the way, huge LGBTQ fucking like, benefactor,
1559080	1568480	and it's like, like snow in the camera, like, didn't ask for it, didn't come hat in hand.
1568480	1573880	You're just like, oh yeah, by the way, gay people, like fucking nailed it.
1573880	1575600	That's true.
1575600	1581320	You did a one-woman show about, where you're like, you know, bearing all and being honest
1581320	1585760	about this, this very, I would say, strange career you've had.
1585760	1586760	Yes.
1586760	1588720	So let's talk about that now.
1588720	1591800	Brandon, you're okay, you got a drink.
1591800	1593680	Settle in, let's go.
1593680	1603920	Some of the striking stuff that I, that about your early career is this, is the alienation,
1603920	1613840	because you didn't, you expressed to interviewers in the past about coming out here, and let's
1613840	1617200	set the stage, it's like, what, 80, when do you?
1617200	1623640	I came out here in like 80s, 86, early 86.
1623640	1628000	And as you described it, and as someone described your description in Wikipedia, it was like
1628000	1633080	on a half promise of something, which I think is everyone's story that comes from somewhere
1633080	1634080	to LA.
1634080	1639200	I'd gotten an LA agent, I had a New York agent, I'd done incredibly well in New York.
1639200	1647000	I had, I'd been there for literally six weeks, I had audition for Mike Nichols, who was directing
1647000	1649200	a Tom Stoppard play on Broadway.
1649200	1650200	I got that job.
1650200	1651200	What?
1651200	1652200	That was me.
1652200	1653200	What?
1653200	1654200	What?
1654200	1655200	What?
1655200	1656200	That's crazy.
1656200	1657200	Yeah, it was crazy.
1657200	1661400	Hey, I just, I'm new in town, and before you can put your suitcase down, you're working
1661400	1662400	with geniuses.
1662400	1668080	I was, but the funny thing was is that I didn't know the part I was auditioning for
1668080	1671360	was actually to understudy Cynthia Nixon.
1671360	1676800	I thought it was to play Jeremy Irons' daughter, but it was in fact to understudy Cynthia Nixon,
1676800	1681480	who was playing Jeremy Irons' daughter, and I was like, fuck that, fuck that noise, I
1681480	1682480	am not doing that.
1682480	1684440	And my agent was like, who are you?
1684440	1689520	And also, to be clear, you were already East Coast, like who comes to the West Coast to
1689520	1691400	do a Tom Stoppard play with Mike Nichols?
1691400	1692400	No, that was in New York.
1692400	1693400	Oh, okay.
1693400	1694400	Yeah, yeah.
1694400	1695400	So this is still, wait.
1695400	1699320	So where were you, what did you come out, I remember, wait, wait, don't tell me.
1699320	1701400	It was in Paris.
1701400	1706400	I was born in Paris, because my father was a foreign correspondent.
1706400	1712300	And so my, and he was actually in Poland when my mother was pregnant with me.
1712300	1717280	And he was, my mother, I have an older brother who was born in London, and she was in Poland
1717280	1719280	when she was pregnant with him as well.
1719280	1725200	And the Polish doctors said to my mother, you don't speak the language very well.
1725200	1729480	And if something goes wrong, we probably can't accommodate you as well as you can in a Western
1729480	1730480	country.
1730480	1731480	I said, get out of here.
1731480	1733080	So go somewhere else.
1733080	1736720	So she went to London for my brother, that was 1963.
1736720	1738640	She went to Paris for me, that was 1964.
1738640	1743520	And people think, by the way, that the phrase Polish medicine is racist.
1743520	1745640	It's totally how they practice.
1745640	1749040	They're just like, hey, you don't talk right, get out of here, we can't.
1749040	1751760	You don't understand us, please go.
1751760	1755200	And she had an aunt and uncle summering in Paris.
1755200	1756700	So she went there.
1756700	1763360	So you, so, so, so, so now it says French-born American actress, which makes me sound like,
1763360	1768520	you know, like I'm Juliette Binoche, but it's nothing like that.
1768520	1770000	It's not at all like that.
1770000	1771000	It's so overstated.
1771000	1774640	And you described like being teased for your voice.
1774640	1775640	Yeah, yeah.
1775640	1781120	It doesn't family alike, I think your quote was, it's basically been the same since I
1781120	1782120	was six.
1782120	1783120	Yes.
1783120	1785120	There, it just didn't change.
1785120	1792480	To what extent was that, I mean, was that really like, did you have moments of like,
1792480	1797000	whatever the vocal equivalent of looking in a mirror was and like wishing, like, like,
1797000	1799560	like, what's the vocal equivalent of patting the bra?
1799560	1802600	What's the vocal equivalent of like, God damn, it changed my voice?
1802600	1805520	Or were you like, fuck this, I can't be ashamed of this.
1806240	1814800	I think, I think I just didn't really, excuse me, I didn't really think that there was anything
1814800	1818520	that would stop me from ruling the world.
1818520	1824880	I just, but I also didn't think that I, my voice would ever be my fortune.
1824880	1830480	So voiceover was never on the menu in terms of how I was going to rule the world.
1830480	1834400	So when people say, when you got the Simpsons, that must have been fantastic.
1834400	1836640	I was like, I don't really care about voiceover.
1836640	1840640	It just, I didn't like, it just didn't even register and didn't register for a really
1840640	1847160	long time because I think I, it just, it had never, I'd never considered it an asset.
1847160	1849280	And so I didn't have a voiceover agent.
1849280	1853080	It just was like, that's not how it's gonna, that's not how I'm going to win.
1853080	1854080	So whatever.
1854080	1855680	Okay, I'll do it.
1855680	1858640	Nobody ever came up to you and said, you should be in voiceover with a voiceover.
1858640	1859640	Oh no.
1859640	1860640	Really?
1860640	1861640	No.
1862520	1865840	The negative word would be narcissism, although I don't call it negative.
1865840	1870400	Like the idea that you're assuming like, that your parents weren't actors.
1870400	1871400	They weren't directors.
1871400	1873920	They weren't, I think your dad was a correspondent or something.
1873920	1876360	Yes, he was a newspaper man.
1876360	1880640	And like these people weren't telling you, oh, Yardley, you got to be an actor.
1880640	1881640	No.
1881640	1884920	But you're thinking in your head one way or another, I'm going to dominate.
1884920	1885920	Yes.
1885920	1890120	What, do you ever, have you thought, does that come from nature or nurture is what we
1890120	1891120	all want to know.
1891120	1892920	Like, what the fuck is wrong with you?
1892920	1894920	No, are you kidding?
1894920	1898080	We want to know how do I, how do I manufacture this?
1898080	1900360	Do I have to be born right?
1900360	1903640	Or do I have to just think it and fucking do it?
1903640	1904640	It's a good question.
1904640	1913720	I don't remember a time, um, well, I think there, it's two sides of the same coin.
1913720	1920120	So I remember, um, being afraid of everything.
1920120	1923360	And so it wasn't that I was fearless.
1923360	1927680	It was that I had this overabundance of courage.
1927680	1934160	And if I didn't, in the face of insurmountable, in the face of extraordinary insecurity, you're
1934160	1936360	not going to punch somebody.
1936360	1937360	No.
1937360	1938360	And I was small.
1938360	1947800	I mean, I was a, I was a little kid and I had this tiny, tiny voice and, um, and I,
1947800	1950800	and yet I had a, there was a ferocity to me.
1950800	1956800	And so, but I also, and I always felt a little bit like I didn't belong.
1956800	1961560	And I remember being about five years old and there was a woman in my neighborhood in
1961560	1965680	Washington, DC, where I grew up and she used to have this theater in the summers.
1965680	1971120	She had a one car garage and she would get all the kids together and, and she would make
1971120	1975200	us lip sync to musicals like The Sound of Music and Fiddler on the Roof and she would
1975200	1976400	dress us up.
1976400	1979920	And she would also do these things like living portraits, right?
1979920	1985280	And so I was a portrait of Mary, that Mary Cassatt did this American artist and I was
1985280	1987780	this, it was a little girl in straw hat.
1987780	1993360	So music was playing and I remember my knees were knocking and there was a curtain and
1993360	1995440	the curtain drew back.
1995440	2001280	And as soon as the light hit me, my knees stopped knocking and I thought like, oh, oh,
2001280	2004720	oh, I, oh, I, oh, okay.
2004720	2007480	I think I'll be all right here.
2007480	2011040	And I just sort of, I think I just felt like I belong.
2011040	2013080	And then after that, I started to do plays.
2013080	2019000	And the great thing about doing a play was even if it had a sad ending, I knew how it
2019000	2021960	ended and I could prepare for it.
2021960	2024400	It was like predicting the future.
2024400	2026240	And so that for a control freak.
2026240	2031040	And managing your relationship with other people who can either be your tormentor or
2031040	2033200	they can sit the fuck down and watch you.
2033200	2036360	You knew what was going to happen and that was very appealing.
2036360	2040000	I did theater as a kid and stuff and I've always felt very comfortable in theater.
2040000	2044480	Did you, did you get the same comfort backstage with the cast and the, you know, the crew
2044480	2045480	and all that?
2045480	2048200	Did you get the same kind of, is that kind of familial?
2048200	2049440	Very, yes.
2049440	2052000	And I loved the relationship with the audience.
2052000	2059520	That exchange of energy was, was extraordinary and it was really powerful.
2059520	2064760	And I remember my first play, you know, my first like real play, we did, I remember Mama
2064760	2067400	and I played the youngest daughter in my very first line.
2067400	2072960	I got this huge laugh and I remember how powerful that was and I just thought, all right.
2072960	2075820	Do you remember it changing the dynamic in your social structure?
2075820	2080600	Was there a moment when you were, because I remember being a dork and stinky and boy
2080600	2083680	did that change.
2083680	2088440	But there was, there was a certain, there was a shift, I don't have a dramatic moment
2088440	2094960	of it, but I was very much not going to stop doing drama club and improv classes because
2094960	2099240	of, do you remember, did it change the dynamic of your whole world?
2099240	2101320	Did you go up on stage and do a thing?
2101320	2105880	And then the next day at school, cause I'm trying to place you in like a hallway or something.
2105880	2106880	Yes.
2106880	2116280	You know, I, my theory is my experience was for the most part, people were really happy
2116280	2127280	and excited that I had clearly sort of, I'd done really well and for lack of a better
2127280	2132160	word, I had sort of cast a spell to the extent that even their own parents had come up and
2132160	2134880	been like, whoa, that was amazing, right?
2134880	2138720	But also there were always kids who were not happy for you.
2138720	2144720	And I feel like any time as a young person and even as a grownup, I suppose, but particularly
2144720	2148320	hard when you're a kid, you do something really well.
2148320	2150640	It sets you, it sets you apart from your peer group.
2150640	2156440	So if you're good at math or sports or drama or anything, it sets you apart and that can
2156440	2157440	be really isolating.
2157440	2163560	And then actually I, I don't know if I'm reading into this, but it, it sets you apart actually
2163560	2167440	more profoundly from the people that were, might've been closer to you had you stayed
2167440	2168440	in your shell.
2168440	2169440	Sure.
2169440	2172720	Then it does the quarterback of the football team and the head cheerleader who are, who
2172720	2175240	are very content to go, Hey, how about that Yardley?
2175240	2177040	I had no problem with her before.
2177040	2178040	Totally ignored her.
2178040	2181800	Now very happy to give her the high school equivalent of best supporting actor.
2181800	2184440	Like they become your biggest fan.
2184440	2186760	They can, they can comfortably make that shift.
2186760	2192080	And somebody that maybe you bonded with in the bathroom and cried with about how hard
2192080	2198440	it feels to be alienated, that may become a person that you actually hurt.
2198440	2204480	They can feel left behind even though you had no intention of leaving them behind.
2204480	2207280	You only got an intention of dominating the world.
2207280	2210200	You got no time to think about it.
2210200	2211720	Come be in my world.
2211720	2212720	Okay.
2212720	2214880	So let me dominate you.
2214880	2217720	No, no, no.
2217720	2218720	And one quick question.
2218720	2219720	I'm a kind ruler.
2219720	2221720	I am a good kind ruler.
2221720	2225080	Are you, are you really, we don't know this yet.
2225080	2229720	We'll fast forward in a second to like, I mean, but, but I do want to dwell here for
2229720	2233760	a second and just ask like, what was the dynamic with the family?
2233760	2236040	Because they weren't actors.
2236040	2237400	They weren't filmmakers.
2237400	2240080	They weren't, did they have expectations of you?
2240080	2249560	Were you letting them down when they suddenly realized that I want to perform?
2249560	2259080	I don't know that I, well, I think, I think they were probably a bit worried that you
2259080	2263920	were going to live at home for a longer time than a doctor forever.
2263920	2268000	That it might not work out the way I had planned because they didn't really have a plan.
2268000	2269000	What's your plan Yardley?
2269000	2270600	I'm just going to, I'm going to rule the world.
2270600	2271600	That's great.
2271600	2272600	How's that?
2272600	2274160	The medical industry like lays it out in a brochure.
2274160	2275160	Exactly.
2275160	2278600	Your daughter will in six years be a registered blue, blue, blue.
2278640	2281480	There, there was no, you know, how are you going to get there?
2283480	2287680	I've got a good feeling though, pretty sure a bunch of shit's going to happen.
2287680	2288680	Sure.
2288680	2289680	He's all going to work out.
2289680	2290680	Why?
2290680	2291680	How do you know?
2291680	2292680	I don't know.
2292680	2293680	I just know.
2293680	2302320	Um, but I, but you know, in our family, I feel like, um, compliments were, uh, implied
2302320	2305040	excellence was expected.
2305040	2307800	And so why is that so funny?
2307800	2310760	Because it's a fucking beautiful way of describing the Midwest.
2310760	2320360	I was like, wow, I wish I could be that gracious instead of going like fucking beard suck, bro.
2320360	2321360	Compliments are implied.
2321360	2322360	Yeah.
2322360	2327520	It was just, you know, there wasn't, it wasn't, uh, well, I would say other people's needs
2327520	2328560	a compliment.
2328560	2331640	The answer is someone who doesn't deserve one.
2331640	2333080	That's the Midwestern philosophy.
2333760	2339080	You don't, you don't plug an air hose into a person with a hole in their air supply.
2339080	2340080	It's not healthy.
2340080	2341080	Yeah.
2341080	2347680	It was, uh, it was, um, it, which is, I think part of the, you know, the flip side of the
2347680	2355120	coin and part of the insecurity of wanting to sort of get a kind of global love, global
2355120	2361840	recognition, excuse me, to make up for this kind of, for this whole.
2361840	2367120	And I have spoken, people say like, oh, Yardley, you know, I joke sometimes like, if I was
2367120	2369680	more like this, I would be more successful.
2369680	2371000	And they're like, shut the fuck up.
2371000	2373240	You're so, you are so successful.
2373240	2374680	And how can you say that?
2374680	2381240	And there is this feeling inside, if you really, really want to get granular about it, that
2381240	2390120	if I, if I felt truly successful, then this, this kind of forever hole inside would feel
2390120	2391520	filled.
2391520	2396040	But the truth of the matter is, is that you can't fill up the inside from the outside.
2396040	2398000	And that's what my one-woman show was about.
2398000	2401160	And so it was a cautionary tale.
2401160	2404800	She's talking some black woman shit to me.
2404800	2408720	That is very impressive.
2408720	2413000	I think it's important to note here for cynics and things, because I mean, I think the, when
2413000	2417880	you take a deep dive and you really bother to think about it and, uh, the Simpsons, which
2417880	2427760	has been on the air longer than the Bible, um, it, um, and we'll, obviously it's like,
2427760	2432880	we should talk about like those first moments of auditioning and things, but like I, it's,
2432880	2437680	it's important to note that like everybody who knows anything about that show and why
2437680	2444040	it's successful, why you have an Emmy, which you, I saw on the internet, you, you don't
2444040	2445040	believe is real.
2446040	2448920	I do now, but it did get in the closet for nine years.
2448920	2454280	But like, um, it, that, that show in general, every performer on that show, like kind of
2454280	2458920	collectively, everybody that worked on that show, I mean, it was, it was an animated show
2458920	2468480	that it, I think your, your, your, your portrayal, like it, it exemplifies the fact, like there's
2468480	2473800	a lot of quotes from Graneigh and from editors and directors, casting directors, friends
2473800	2479720	of yours and things that are kind of like, yeah, she didn't like it, it, who knows Flukety
2479720	2484600	Fluke, who knows how you end up being the voice of a cartoon, but like the important
2484600	2491760	thing about that cartoon, the reason why it's now in its 60th season is because of this
2491760	2501520	weird blend of grounded dramatic performance and cartoonishly accessible, um, uh, voices.
2501520	2503240	I mean, you're being drawn.
2503240	2509880	And so it's like, yeah, so, so I, I, I just wanted to take that detour for a second in
2509880	2514880	case anybody like in the audience is like listening to our, our path through your career
2514880	2517640	and going like, what the fuck, man, whatever.
2517640	2521640	You show up for an audition, you got a squeaky voice, you end up like the voice of a thing.
2521640	2525560	It's like, no, this is not like this, there are, there are no flukes here.
2525560	2530360	And in fact, what you're describing is actually kind of like something that you're not allowed
2530360	2536040	to own as a person, which is this what if of like, yeah, but what if, I mean, I was
2536040	2541840	designed for world domination and I fucking dominated it through the most random channel.
2541840	2545400	What if, what if that channel hadn't been there?
2545400	2546800	I might've been a Senator.
2546800	2550760	I might've been, I don't know, like, like, and I won't put you on the spot with that,
2550760	2554160	but I, I just wanted to drunkenly disrupt everything.
2554160	2560960	Well, Dan and I were friends with Sam Simon and I was talking to him about the early days
2560960	2566160	of that and he, he was talking about how he didn't like the way it changed after so many
2566160	2571640	seasons and you know, cause he's Sam and he, you know, he, he left after what, two seasons
2571640	2572640	or something like that?
2572640	2574680	Uh, three or four, I think, but yes.
2574680	2579680	But he was talking about it and I remember him saying that like going down the list of
2579680	2583920	the cast of characters, what Bart is, what Homer is, what Marge is, and he said, Lisa
2583920	2585720	is the conscience of the show.
2585720	2586720	Yes.
2586720	2588560	And that's why Lisa's the one that makes you cry.
2588560	2589560	Yeah.
2589560	2590560	Yeah.
2590560	2591560	That's great.
2591560	2593760	Well, these amazing episodes, the Homer's crayon one, I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm not going
2593760	2600560	to pretend I've watched all 700,000 episodes of The Simpsons, but I, I mean, the, I understand
2600560	2606040	why your performance got a voiceover, Emmy, I, I, you, you said you accept it now.
2606040	2607520	You definitely need to accept it.
2607520	2609000	I'm taking my two Emmys.
2609000	2610720	I got one for writing the Oscars.
2610720	2611720	That's cheating.
2611720	2615880	It's the most watched thing ever.
2615880	2618880	Of course you got an Emmy.
2618880	2620240	You wrote the Oscars?
2620240	2621240	That's right.
2621240	2622240	Bitch.
2622240	2627560	You wrote the, and now I got a statue that says I'm talented.
2627560	2629200	So now I am.
2629200	2631760	You however, earned it.
2631760	2637520	Um, so, so let's, I mean, so you go to New York, you do the Mike Nichols thing.
2637520	2641120	Is it, I think one of your first jobs is maximum overdrive.
2641120	2647000	I like, you, you said something amazing about it and your Wikipedia page, don't, don't sustain
2647000	2649000	your applause.
2649000	2657360	Like, um, you had a quote, the quote trickled down to your Wikipedia, which is exactly what
2657360	2664040	those people are thinking, which was something like truly dreadful movie, but a fantastic
2664040	2665040	role.
2665040	2666640	Like, such a good role.
2666640	2668600	It was, uh, it was a bomb when it came out.
2668600	2670760	I've been in several of those.
2670760	2676480	Um, but the great thing about the early eighties, so I think I, so I also did a movie called
2676480	2677720	The Legend of Billie Jean.
2677720	2678720	Right.
2678720	2679720	Yeah.
2679720	2680720	Yes, Queen.
2680720	2681720	I think the kids say now.
2681720	2682720	Yes.
2682720	2683720	That's what they say.
2683720	2684720	Yeah.
2684720	2685720	Uh-huh.
2685720	2686840	So I, uh, my first movie was a movie called Heaven Help Us.
2686840	2689840	That was in 1984.
2689840	2690880	No, wait, wait.
2690880	2692040	Heaven Help Us.
2692040	2693040	Everybody was in that movie.
2693040	2699800	Andrew McCarthy, um, Patrick Dempsey, uh, Kevin Dillon, Mary Stewart Masterson.
2699800	2700800	Okay.
2700800	2701800	But what was that?
2701800	2702800	Donald Sutherland.
2702800	2703800	What was the plot?
2703800	2704800	It was about a Catholic boy's school in the 1960s.
2704800	2710160	It was sort of about, originally it was actually a quite serious script about the corporal
2710160	2715280	punishment that goes on in a boy's school, a Catholic boy's school in the sixties.
2715280	2718560	And then by the time they were done with it, it was more like Porky's goes to Catholic
2718560	2719560	school.
2719560	2721160	I know I've seen this for sure.
2721160	2724760	So that wasn't, and it was directed by Michael Dinner, who then went on to create.
2724760	2725760	Michael Dinner.
2725760	2727760	Sorry, just a fun name.
2727760	2731920	He went on to create the, the Wonder Years.
2731920	2732920	You can call him Ray.
2732920	2733920	You can call him Ray.
2733920	2734920	But you can't call him Michael Dinner.
2734920	2738880	Brandon, did you work with Michael Dinner?
2738880	2739880	Every evening.
2739880	2741040	I'm so sorry.
2741040	2743520	I actively sabotage myself as a podcast.
2743520	2745120	Like, it's a great episode.
2745120	2746120	You're on it.
2746120	2747120	Keep talking, please.
2747120	2748120	I'm so sorry.
2748120	2749120	No, it's fine.
2749120	2750120	It's all good.
2750760	2758080	Um, so after that, I did, uh, The Legend of Billie Jean, which was yes.
2758080	2762080	And Christian Slater, not related, although they play brother and sister.
2762080	2763080	So weird.
2763080	2764080	I know.
2764080	2765080	It's super weird.
2765080	2766080	That is weird.
2766080	2767080	Kind of alike.
2767080	2771480	Cause they both, you know, they dyed his hair blonde and, but, um, anywho, not related.
2771480	2773720	And that movie was such a bomb.
2773720	2777040	It was barely out long enough to run the end credits.
2778040	2784520	What was great was was 1985 and cable television had just come on the scene and they didn't
2784520	2785520	have anything.
2785520	2790440	So they ran that fucking thing ad nauseam 24 seven.
2790440	2795760	And it is now this huge cult classic, which I was just going to say, like, same with maximum
2795760	2796760	overdrive.
2796760	2802720	Oh, but they, then it's all these rules and when the WGA negotiates with the PGA, the
2802720	2808640	professional professional golfers association, like they talk about these windows and things
2808640	2814240	like, and it's like, it all has to do with like, when we were kids and it was like, why
2814240	2816720	do I think up the Creek was such a classic?
2816720	2820640	Well, because you saw it 75,000 times.
2820640	2824800	I watched Kroll for like two years.
2824800	2825800	That was all that was on.
2825800	2832080	Cause it's the only thing that was on, but that's also like the original Star Trek series.
2832080	2833520	It's a similar paradigm.
2833520	2838240	Like they didn't, they got canceled right out of the gate and then it was just such
2838240	2839680	a success in syndication.
2839680	2843960	It's like, I think that's always a TV writer producers.
2843960	2849240	Like you, you, you early on you have that conflict where you see your numbers or whatever.
2849240	2852040	Someone tells you, you failed on Thursday night.
2852040	2853040	You fucked up.
2853040	2854040	You didn't do good.
2854040	2855560	What do you mean it ended good?
2855560	2859720	Well, the hammer you hit, the thing slid up and it didn't hit the bell that says you're
2859720	2866360	a muscle man and uh, which means retaining the office's numbers by 90% or higher.
2866360	2872160	And you're like, I always, I mean, I, it was, it was such a late motif back then where it
2872160	2873680	was like, Oh, give me a break.
2873680	2877360	If you just market the show better or give us a better time slot, these people only like
2877360	2882920	what you tell them to catch yourself in that moment going like, wait, what do I believe
2882920	2883920	in at all?
2883920	2884920	Right.
2884920	2885920	I do.
2885920	2887760	Do I believe in like making a thing?
2888440	2890040	This is not what this interview should be about.
2890040	2893160	Let's, let's, let's, let's go back to the legend of Billy Jean, which is a fantastic
2893160	2896960	fucking movie that is inspired so many, no, it's terrible.
2896960	2897960	It's awful.
2897960	2902600	And so is Goonies and like, like there's so many fucking movies that people think are
2902600	2904680	good and they just fucking suck.
2904680	2905680	But what is it?
2905680	2907480	What is a good movie's job?
2907480	2912200	It's to be there, but I, okay.
2912200	2914440	It's to be there when you're going through puberty.
2914440	2917640	You're just like drinking off and you're like, I'm coming while I'm looking at talking
2917640	2918640	trucks.
2918640	2920920	Oh, transformers are amazing.
2920920	2924040	Fair enough.
2924040	2929320	I mean, people really did, for whatever reason, it was a, it was a movie that people really
2929320	2935080	loved and I get recognized for it about once a week, still legend and maximum overdrive,
2935080	2937960	but mostly I think because I look exactly the same.
2937960	2938960	I am one of those people.
2938960	2943240	If you saw a picture of me when I was four, you'd go Yardley, that's you.
2943240	2944560	You are super memorable.
2944560	2946880	And I sound the same, pretty much.
2946880	2950800	And this is me and this is Lisa Simpson, it all is just very, very close.
2950800	2956900	She raises her voice a little bit to do the character, but you have said, sorry, one thing
2956900	2960720	about that though, cause that's important cause one, one very sage thing that you said,
2960720	2964360	I don't know when you learned it, when you look back, you're, I think around that time
2964360	2973000	you said so much better to, to, to have a tiny role in a, in a giant movie than to wait
2973000	2978480	for the lead role in something that, yeah, like, like, like it's, you can occupy that
2978480	2983880	real estate by being yourself, not yourself, you're not those characters, but being, check
2983880	2984880	me out.
2984880	2985880	Look what I can do.
2985880	2989240	I think that there is, you can always, I mean, there is that old saying, you know, it's not
2989240	2993960	the size of the role, it is, it's this size and skill of the actor, right?
2993960	3001760	But I do believe that for the most part with very few exceptions, you can do a lot with
3001760	3005240	not very much on the page, right?
3005240	3008800	And so I was pretty much game for anything.
3008800	3013360	I have to ask, like, so because your director on maximum overdrive was literally Stephen
3013360	3014360	King.
3014360	3015360	Yes.
3015360	3020120	Who was coming off of, I believe as legend habit has it, he's like, he hated, he hated
3020120	3021440	Kubrick's The Shining.
3021440	3022440	Yeah.
3022440	3024000	He's like, God damn it.
3024000	3026720	What a shitty version of The Shining.
3026720	3033520	If I, Stephen King, who wrote all these books, if they just let me run the camera, I'd give
3033520	3035520	them what for.
3035520	3036520	Yeah.
3036520	3043200	And I'm not, I mean, I, I, he's a fucking hero and I don't mean to piss, but, but like,
3043200	3049160	I, I, I also watching that movie, you're like, well, Kubrick also is an important person.
3050160	3051760	Maybe it's an honor that he changed.
3051760	3055560	Yeah, but you know, maximum overdrive also was a 12 page short story.
3055560	3059480	It's just like what a truck came alive and signed Stephen King.
3059480	3060480	Yeah.
3060480	3061480	I mean.
3061480	3063480	Age 11.
3063480	3064720	I was born in Maine.
3064720	3065880	I'm going to die there.
3065880	3070360	I fucking am having the time of my life and my typewriter lost its backspace key.
3070360	3071360	Amen.
3071360	3072360	Amen.
3072360	3073360	Sorry.
3073360	3074360	I'm a little jealous.
3074360	3075360	It was.
3075360	3077920	But, but, but how was he as a director on set, like as a person, like as a supporter
3077920	3082680	of lovely as pie as a person, but apparently it was also at the height of his alcoholism
3082680	3083680	and drug addiction.
3083680	3084680	I love him so much.
3084680	3085680	Oh my God.
3085680	3088720	So it was absolute chaos.
3088720	3094480	And we had, um, so Deena De Laurentiis was the, uh, was the production company.
3094480	3099720	So we had a pretty much all Italian crew who literally didn't speak English.
3099720	3104200	So we had Steven who doesn't speak Italian and we had a translator.
3104200	3105200	I'm not even kidding.
3105200	3110400	We must've added, I don't know, two weeks in translation alone, as he would say, this
3110400	3114440	is what I'd like to do in the translator labor to Italians.
3114440	3117800	The Italians would let him talk to the guy and the guy would then talk to Steve.
3117800	3119800	I'm like, oh my fucking God.
3119800	3121480	And he just went on back and forth like that.
3121480	3127280	And he, you know, to his enormous credit, he was very humble and said, I don't know
3127280	3128280	what I'm doing.
3128280	3133120	And so they positioned people around him who didn't know what they were doing, but they
3133120	3135320	also didn't speak the language.
3135320	3139880	So it was quite cumbersome and Deena De Laurentiis, you know, it was at the time when we went
3139880	3144760	and Canon films also was of the same sort of ilk where they just did everything on the
3144760	3145760	cheap.
3145760	3151040	And when the, you know, the, the till hit 5 million, that was the budget and if you didn't
3151040	3152040	finish, fuck you, you're done.
3152040	3155680	Blow up the truck, put the people in a boat, call in ACDC.
3155680	3156680	Yes.
3156680	3157680	Done.
3157680	3158680	Thanks for coming.
3158680	3159920	So it was an adventure.
3159920	3165680	And I actually remember there's a scene where the truck drives through the diner side wall,
3165680	3167880	the window, picture window.
3167880	3170040	They had one opportunity to do that.
3170040	3174720	They built that truck stop and they, they didn't have a stunt double for me.
3174720	3179920	And they said, Yardley, you're going to stand there and the car, this Cadillac is going
3179920	3183520	to drive through the wall, but don't worry, it's going to go super slow and it's going
3183520	3186080	to be so easy and safe.
3186080	3190880	And don't move until we tell you, cause we only have one shot at this and I'm like,
3190880	3191880	okay.
3191880	3194400	So, you know, I'm like, okay.
3194400	3201360	So I do that and I'm not kidding you, that fucking thing was going like 20 miles an hour.
3201360	3209880	It went so fast and it just plows through this wall and I am.
3209880	3213680	And finally I'm just like, why are you going to say move?
3213680	3221120	And why, why can't you put someone in a way this shot is from behind me or it's no good
3221120	3223920	or it's a shot of a car coming toward me.
3223920	3224920	Shoot the fucking car.
3224920	3225920	Get me out of here.
3225920	3226920	I had so much hair.
3226920	3229040	You can't even see my face.
3229040	3231160	So yeah, glass everywhere in my hair.
3231160	3232160	The whole thing.
3232160	3233160	Yeah.
3233160	3234160	It was an adventure.
3234160	3235160	Was it ACDC?
3235160	3236160	Who made who?
3236160	3237160	Who made who?
3237160	3240200	Did they write that for the movie or is that one of their songs that they just, I was hoping
3240200	3241200	you'd know.
3241200	3242200	I don't know.
3242200	3243200	I bet.
3243720	3248800	I'm always so curious about that when there's like an 80s movie and it's like a goblin dicks
3248800	3249800	nine.
3249800	3254880	And then there's like a kind of a pseudo famous like band, but it's like, but the title of
3254880	3257320	the song isn't goblin dicks.
3257320	3260880	It's like, like my heart's like a goblin.
3260880	3266280	And you're kind of like, are you just being classy or did they, like, how did those conversations
3266280	3267280	work?
3267280	3271920	Who did all the nightmare on Elm Street, Dokken, like, like, yeah, well nightmare on Elm Street
3271920	3277160	franchise is has sucked in some of our world's greatest talent.
3277160	3283360	Will Smith will never escape like, like, like the fat boys were got, got, got drawn in.
3283360	3289160	Do you know, they wrote the, they wrote the Ghostbusters theme song before the movie.
3289160	3290160	The fat boys.
3290160	3291160	Really?
3291160	3292160	Ray Parker Jr.
3292160	3293160	Oh, wait.
3293160	3296520	They had the Ghostbusters song and then they were like, we got to write a movie around
3296520	3297520	this song.
3297520	3298520	Is that true?
3298520	3301360	I don't know what your joke is.
3301400	3303600	I'm too drunk to follow your joke.
3303600	3305200	I just wanted to be included.
3305200	3306200	Sorry.
3306200	3307200	Brandon.
3307200	3311040	So I told her Ray Parker Jr. lie.
3311040	3315840	By the way, Brandon's been a voice on The Simpsons for the last 35 years.
3315840	3317680	We wanted to find out if you knew him.
3317680	3318680	Bravo you.
3318680	3319680	Me too.
3319680	3325440	I'm a stand-in for Hibber.
3325440	3326760	Who does Dr. Hibber?
3326760	3327760	Who is the?
3327760	3328760	Harry.
3328760	3329760	That's Harry Shearer.
3329760	3330760	Yes.
3331160	3335600	The fucking, I take it this is a, a hoo hoo hoo.
3335600	3336600	Yes, perfect.
3336600	3337600	Unexpected pregnancy.
3337600	3338600	Perfect.
3338600	3346080	I mean the character is fantastic, that's such a, when I moved to L.A. we would watch
3346080	3347080	it and sit occasionally.
3347080	3348840	God damn, you don't get funnier than this.
3348840	3349840	This is crazy.
3349840	3354840	When you guys, all right, when you were doing the, sort of on the Tracy Allman show.
3354840	3355840	Yes.
3355840	3359000	And you guys do the little kind of in and outs of commercials and stuff like that.
3359000	3363880	When you were doing that, like how serious, obviously you could have no idea what the
3363880	3369160	future would hold for that show, but what was that like doing those little bits?
3369160	3377840	It was, I remember, so I got the job because I had done a play at the Fountain Theater
3377840	3385680	here in L.A. that I think literally 17 people saw, but one of those people a year later
3385680	3389400	would cast The Simpsons on the Tracy Allman show.
3389400	3394560	So when people ask me how do I get into voiceover, I'm like you're, it's like asking me to solve
3394560	3397760	your calculus, you know, problem with an abacus.
3397760	3398760	I don't know.
3398760	3405000	Because I did it, it just was so odd for me, it just didn't happen the way it usually happens.
3405000	3411200	So I went in to read and I originally read for Bart, but that really lasted mere seconds
3412200	3416960	and Nancy was there that day as well and she read for Lisa, but she always wanted to read
3416960	3420800	for Bart and she did voiceover already.
3420800	3426760	She was already an expert, she was already doing cartoons and so I then read for Lisa.
3426760	3428320	Had you not done a cartoon before?
3428320	3429320	Oh no.
3429320	3435240	Yeah, no, again, voiceover, I was like I don't care about voiceover, but I was not an actor
3435240	3437640	who ever said no to an audition.
3437640	3443240	So I was like, all right, fine, I'll go, as long as it doesn't get in my way of world
3443240	3445440	domination, I'm good.
3445440	3446440	Let's do this.
3446440	3450080	Because it's a choice gig, if you can do it, there's no, you can come in your pajamas, you
3450080	3451080	can like.
3451080	3456920	Right, but you know that thing, people do ask me that, they're like, do you got to work
3456920	3457920	in your pajamas?
3457920	3458920	I'm like, do you?
3458920	3467440	Oh, sorry, well, I do, but I got fired shortly after.
3468440	3471560	I did eventually, the minute I thought it was possible, I started doing it and then
3471560	3472560	I got fired.
3472560	3474560	I was like, it's post-production.
3474560	3479200	I just feel like, you know, it raises more questions than an answer.
3479200	3482080	That's a good point, that's a very good point.
3482080	3487240	How close to Lisa as we know it was your audition?
3487240	3495240	I think actually I sounded more like myself in the beginning and then as the characters
3495240	3502360	got cuter, as the animation got cuter, her voice got a little bit cuter, it morphed a
3502360	3504400	little bit, but not that much.
3504400	3510880	What's interesting and a little bit sad, and I'll let you in on a heartbreak a little bit,
3510880	3520040	so they finally, finally, I stumped for one of our phenomenal actresses, Tress MacNeil,
3520040	3528520	who does Crazy Cat Lady and Mrs. Skinner and Cookie Kwan, and like any number of this,
3528520	3533360	she doesn't do one of the family members, but she does any number of the cast in Springfield,
3533360	3541080	and she does Shauna, the girlfriend of one of the bullies, who talks like this, you know,
3541080	3542960	she's this valley girl.
3542960	3547960	And so Tress wasn't at the read-through one day and they said, Yardley, why don't you
3547960	3548960	do it?
3548960	3550160	No, great, I'll do it.
3550160	3552720	So it was really strong and they really loved it.
3552720	3560400	So the next couple of weeks, they wrote a valley girl kind of friend for Lisa Simpson.
3560400	3567360	And the problem was, is that if you ask me to do another character who's the same age
3567360	3573800	as Lisa Simpson, I don't have the ability to make the voice different enough to make
3573800	3576440	it not sound like Lisa Simpson.
3576440	3583360	The difference in doing Lisa Simpson and Shauna is that Shauna's like 16, so that worked.
3583360	3588840	And so we recorded it, and then I got an email from the producer saying, I'm sorry, Yardley,
3588840	3595920	it's not different enough, we're cutting it, and I'm like, fuck, dude, I mean, it's terrible.
3595920	3597880	So I really am a one-trick pony.
3597880	3598880	There you go.
3598880	3601320	Who's the rangiest?
3601320	3602320	Harry probably?
3602320	3603320	Oh, I don't know.
3603320	3607280	Hank, Dan and Harry, I would say all three of them, really neck and neck.
3607280	3611400	To watch those guys go from voice to voice to voice, it never gets old.
3611400	3617760	Like we, me, so Hank lives in New York, Harry lives all over the world, so Dan, Julie, me
3617760	3622120	and Nancy all record all together, and Tress is there often as well.
3622120	3626560	And to watch those guys go, all of them do multiple voices.
3626560	3629920	And I just, I stand between them, I stand between Nancy and Dan.
3629920	3630920	Oh, is that true?
3630920	3631920	Yeah, it never gets old.
3632000	3634680	Are you guys all, if you're doing a scene, you're all physically in the room?
3634680	3636400	Yeah, like an old radio play.
3636400	3638600	Even if Harry or whoever is out galloping.
3638600	3644440	Yeah, he'll actually, somebody will temp for him, and then he'll do his stuff on his own.
3644440	3648560	I've always wondered, are you physically in the room together, or is it all just wild
3648560	3649560	stuff alone?
3649560	3651800	No, we're all together in the room.
3651800	3653040	That's gotta be important, too.
3653040	3654040	That's gotta make it...
3654040	3658240	It gives it a really different texture, I mean, because obviously the way you say something
3658240	3661020	is going to form the way I answer.
3661020	3667940	And I think Jim Brooks, James L. Brooks, our executive producer, he comes from sitcoms.
3667940	3673060	And so when we first started doing The Bumpers, as you were asking, I think he was like, I
3673060	3674980	don't know why this would be any different.
3674980	3677460	It doesn't matter to me that nobody can see you.
3677460	3678460	It's still a conversation.
3678460	3680340	Of course you'll all be together.
3680340	3685820	And so while most cartoons do do it separately, like when we did that crossover with Family
3685820	3688980	Guy, I went and did all my stuff by myself.
3688980	3693540	I didn't meet Mila Kunis, even though my scenes were with Meg.
3693540	3695140	They did all my stuff wild.
3695140	3696140	Which I can do, of course.
3696140	3697340	I know the character well enough.
3697340	3699380	You thought maybe when you were watching it, like...
3699380	3700380	It's not as fun.
3700380	3702780	I'd much rather do my stuff with the person.
3702780	3705020	I never would have thought to ask you that question.
3705020	3706500	That's how much I would have assumed.
3706500	3708260	Yes, I think everybody does.
3708260	3712260	Because I would have thought I would be high-roading you to be like, you guys aren't in the room
3712260	3714100	together.
3714100	3717260	It's exciting to me that that's how they do it.
3717260	3719700	After all these years, it's still that way.
3719700	3720700	Yes.
3720700	3721700	Because it's pretty...
3721700	3722700	Yeah.
3722700	3725380	From a production standpoint, it is needlessly extravagant.
3725380	3726380	Yes.
3726380	3727620	You're talking about actors' schedules.
3727620	3732260	It's much easier to treat human beings like cattle, shuffle them in one at a time, isolate
3732260	3733260	all of them.
3733260	3735860	Way less chance of anything uncontrollable happening.
3735860	3736860	It's the way I prefer it.
3736860	3740620	Yeah, I just feel like it's my job, and so you own me.
3740620	3742580	So all right, I'll show up.
3742700	3748260	The way we did Anomalisa, the way we did Abid's Uncontrollable Christmas, because we were
3748260	3749740	doing special things.
3749740	3754340	We were absolutely like, nope, soundstage, entire cast.
3754340	3757980	Everyone's like, well, this is going to be terribly problematic if this person interrupts
3757980	3758980	that person.
3758980	3765140	And we're like, yeah, but I think that's tremendously commendable.
3765140	3766820	I was a Simpson.
3766820	3768340	I had a little part.
3768340	3770300	I did a little cameo.
3770300	3772580	And I went into the place where you guys record.
3772580	3775620	And I saw multiple microphones, but I didn't think you actually used them.
3775620	3776620	We do.
3776620	3777620	We do.
3777620	3782740	Sadly, our guest stars don't usually come and record with us, mostly because their schedules
3782740	3783740	don't permit it.
3783740	3785740	It would have made me puke blood.
3785740	3788620	I would have been able to hand...
3788620	3791620	It was just...
3791620	3793620	That's the way you want to be on The Simpsons.
3793620	3794620	No, it's not.
3794620	3795620	It's so much more fun.
3795620	3796620	You want to come in alone.
3796620	3797620	No.
3797620	3798620	It's true.
3798620	3799620	Treat you like the most important person.
3799620	3800620	You don't want to...
3800620	3801860	No, I'm telling you it's true.
3801860	3802860	The customer's always right.
3802860	3804340	I did not want to be there with you.
3804340	3805340	I would have freaked out.
3805340	3806340	Yes, you do.
3806340	3807340	No, I don't.
3807340	3808340	We're fun.
3808340	3809340	Goddamn it.
3809340	3810340	Stop that!
3810340	3811340	We're fun and gentle.
3811340	3812340	No.
3812340	3813340	Shut up.
3813340	3819300	Okay, so banana peels and stoplights, you end up in the longest running sitcom in television
3819300	3820300	fucking history.
3820300	3821300	Yes.
3821300	3830460	By the way, also though, in the 90s, like Herman's head, what else was there?
3830460	3834580	Don't hold your Herman's head, applause.
3834580	3839180	I was a devotee of Herman's head, however, I'm also an alcoholic, so I can't remember
3839180	3841020	if you were actually inside Herman's head or not.
3841020	3842020	No, I was in the office.
3842020	3843020	I was his best friend.
3843020	3847020	You were the boof to Herman's teen wolf.
3847020	3848020	You were the...
3848020	3849020	The boof.
3849020	3850980	Well, okay, that's my language for...
3850980	3851980	You were the...
3851980	3852980	I was his best friend.
3852980	3855740	Yeah, you were the will they won't they, right?
3855740	3856740	Yes, yes.
3856740	3857740	In a long term.
3857740	3858740	The Winnie Cooper.
3858740	3859740	Or not the Winnie Cooper.
3859740	3860740	It was so dumb.
3860740	3862740	I was like, yes.
3862740	3866820	It was like, we were supposed to, if that show lasted more than eight episodes, we were
3866820	3869860	supposed to, I think, eventually be like, go to her.
3869860	3873020	Right, and then he did, right?
3873020	3877380	My character's name was Louise, she was really great fun, and I was this sort of breakout
3877380	3881140	character, and they wrote...
3881140	3882860	I always got some...
3882860	3888260	In each show, I got always a really good funny joke, which I very much enjoyed, but then
3888260	3894820	for some peculiar reason, which didn't actually make sense to me, and no slag on virgins,
3894820	3898420	but they made my character a virgin, and I was like, but why?
3898420	3899420	What is...
3899420	3900420	Like, why?
3900420	3901420	What's the point?
3901420	3902420	What's your point?
3902420	3907260	Anywho, they did it, and then they decided that she would lose her virginity to...
3907780	3910740	Herman, and so she did that.
3910740	3912380	Thus justifying the...
3912380	3916620	Changing the meaning of the title entirely.
3916620	3920020	You know, there was a porn video that came out called Herman's Other Head.
3920020	3921020	Oh my God.
3921020	3922020	Yeah.
3922020	3923020	I believe we had a clip.
3923020	3924020	There was a community porno.
3924020	3925020	No?
3925020	3928020	Oh, wait.
3928020	3933100	The community porno I was so disappointed with initially, because it was like unreleased.
3933100	3934100	Initially.
3934100	3935100	And...
3935100	3936100	He came around.
3936260	3942300	That's when I realized, I was like, of course the community porno should be this disaster.
3942300	3943300	It's perfect this way.
3943300	3946500	It's like, these guys are misfits at a community college.
3946500	3950100	It's good that Abbot's being played by that guy.
3950100	3951100	Anyways.
3951100	3965540	Well, maybe to backtrack just for a second, because I am curious, because all the respect
3965540	3968340	that you are paid by the people that have worked with you.
3968340	3974420	It does include the idea that when you're doing Lisa, which you've done for multiple
3974420	3981620	decades now, that there might be a little bit of curation there, which guys like me
3981620	3985380	might bristle at the idea of, like, what?
3985380	3990780	The actor got a script and looked at it and said, no, she wouldn't say that?
3990780	3992940	How often does that really happen?
3992940	3996300	It doesn't happen very often.
3996300	4002180	But I will say, on the very rare occasion that the writers, they either write something
4002180	4008540	that I don't think Lisa Simpson would say, or they write somebody being really mean to
4008540	4015180	Lisa and she doesn't have a response to that, then I will always fight that fight.
4015180	4017300	I have to stick up for my girl.
4017300	4020660	And I might not win it, but I have to fight it.
4020660	4032100	Yeah, and it's important to, I think it's important, like, in those moments, what phraseology
4032100	4034180	would you use?
4034180	4035180	Because there's-
4035180	4036580	I don't think she would say that.
4036580	4037580	Is that what you mean?
4037580	4038580	Okay.
4038580	4039580	Well, yeah, but I mean-
4039580	4040580	How blunt am I now?
4040580	4044260	Well, do you strike a balance between, like, I think that this is kind of a cultural hot
4044260	4052060	button in the workplace to be, like, I think things should be different around here.
4052060	4057100	Some of the most conscientious people might be terrified of making too many waves.
4057100	4062060	If I'm a cool person, then I'm not going to be one of those people, et cetera, et cetera.
4062060	4069220	I think it's an ongoing thing of, is there a certain parlance, especially with actors?
4069940	4077140	Is there a magical way to present your difference of opinion with the material you're reading
4077140	4082580	and you're about to shoot, that in a world where actors, other actors, younger actors
4082580	4084660	might say, are you fucking kidding me?
4084660	4087940	Yeah, you can be as conscientious as you want, but it's fucking eat or be eaten out here.
4087940	4093180	I'm going to do whatever- or even more extreme, like, I'm not taking that job because from
4093180	4098780	the get-go, it's these things, like, do you have any advice about that for, like, when
4098780	4104100	you're adjusting to a role that you're already cast in?
4104100	4107460	I, um, well, it-
4107460	4108460	It's a dumb question.
4108460	4109460	It's a stupid question.
4109460	4110460	I'm a bad interviewer.
4110460	4111460	No, it's not a stupid question.
4111460	4113020	You know, I always-
4113020	4114020	So it's a smart question?
4114020	4117020	So I'm, like, a good interviewer.
4117020	4119980	Well, I'm just- I'm not- maybe I'm not sure I understand the question.
4120060	4125020	I guess I'm kind of like- it's actually a sequel to a question that I've asked Kumail
4125020	4128460	Nanjiani, who's an old friend of the podcast that all these people miss.
4128460	4129460	Fuck off.
4129460	4136620	Um, he's a person of color, for instance.
4136620	4142860	Like, it's like, in this day and age where it's, like, we're beyond the point of, like,
4142860	4148460	the Hollywood shuffle concept of, like, well, you got to do what you got to do.
4148460	4150660	Everyone's trying to find their way.
4150660	4155780	And I'm endlessly curious about how these dialogues are supposed to get struck up in
4155780	4159420	a creative environment where there's such a hierarchy established.
4159420	4164580	A hierarchy which I, frankly, I'm not- I'm not in a hurry to let go.
4164580	4169220	Not because I'm an egomaniac, but because I'm a chaosphobe.
4169220	4173300	And I don't necessarily want to just be like, here's the suggestion box.
4173300	4176020	Let's have everybody start having an open dialogue.
4176540	4183420	Um, and it, like, I'm just curious on the- on the actor side, like, if there's a- if
4183420	4188180	there's a kind of code for an actor who's, like, 25 years old, and they're on the set
4188180	4191660	of their fucking thing, and they're like, god damn it, just get through this and don't
4191660	4192660	get fired.
4192660	4196340	But then they see something, and let's say that they were like, I don't think either
4196340	4201340	this character would say this, or maybe in a larger sense, this is a little fucking iffy,
4201340	4202340	sketchy.
4202340	4204580	Well, I have, um, a couple of things.
4204580	4211860	I mean, always I feel like you get more- you get further with honey than with vinegar,
4211860	4212860	obviously.
4212860	4217580	And so, if you have the ability to be tactful, that will always serve you.
4217580	4223220	I don't think that you have to be- I don't- I don't think you have to pussyfoot around
4223220	4226500	your point so much that you can't get your point across.
4226500	4228180	Um, two things.
4228180	4236060	Like, if you're an actor who is struggling with a line, I always feel like- I'm the sort
4236060	4242300	of person who will always give you 100 percent, so if I'm- at this point, if I'm having trouble
4242300	4248980	with a line, then, like, really trouble with a line, like, I can't remember it, then I'm
4248980	4256180	gonna say it's possible that the line doesn't actually make sense.
4256180	4262180	Like there is a problem with the logic of the line, so are you willing, and hopefully
4262180	4265820	the person on the other side, the director, if that's who the person that you're speaking
4265820	4271340	to, or the writer, if that person is also present, is willing to have the conversation
4271340	4275620	with you to say, can you tell me what's the overall intent of what we're trying to get
4275620	4276820	across here?
4276820	4280780	Because maybe what you wrote isn't actually what you mean.
4280780	4285660	And if we can actually get to that, then I bet you I can remember that line and that
4285660	4288780	motherfucker comes out so well, everybody's happy.
4288780	4289780	That's what I think.
4289780	4293340	So yeah, I mean, like, it's- yeah.
4293340	4297420	Find a positive way to say it, which is like, I want to help your show be good.
4297420	4299220	I mean, we're all on the same side.
4299220	4300980	We want the same win, right?
4300980	4307140	And in terms of Lisa Simpson, if there's a line that really, really bumps for me, you
4307140	4311500	know, that's always pretty easy.
4311500	4317780	But I never, I'm not, I don't have no desire to excoriate you and say, this is the stupidest
4317780	4321220	fucking thing I've ever seen, even if that's what I feel inside.
4321220	4325860	Nor would you, I'm getting the implication, like, because you said, look, at the end of
4325860	4327380	the day, I'm going to do it.
4327380	4333460	Like you wouldn't probably wouldn't do a standoff, which is all the more, the fact that a good
4333460	4336500	actor, just a good writer writes what they're hired to write.
4336500	4338900	A good actor acts what they're hired to act.
4338900	4343940	So we have this kind of Jedi code of like, I'm not going to be a bad craftsman, but then
4343940	4349180	there's this like, holy, like thing that should unite all of us where like, if you, in the
4349180	4354060	commission of writing this amazing thing, and you wanting the best actor, like, like
4354060	4359420	we could like connect and you could go, look, at the end of the day, I'll say this shitty
4359420	4362660	ass line, I'll fucking do it.
4362660	4364140	I'm about to do it.
4364140	4366820	Before I do, do you want to make it better?
4366820	4367820	I mean, that's the point.
4367940	4370900	Did you cast me because I have an energy about me?
4370900	4376380	I think Humphrey Bogart, I think said, like when you look at a line and a page that is
4376380	4381220	just impossible to say with a straight face, like it's just such a bad line and you fought
4381220	4384100	your fight, but this is just how it's going to be because the director is so big or the
4384100	4385500	writer or whatever.
4385500	4391260	And his thing was, if a line is impossible to deliver well, just say it out loud.
4391260	4393020	Don't give it, don't give it anything.
4393020	4394020	Just say it.
4394020	4396060	And it often turns out to be great.
4396700	4398580	Sometimes it would be a very memorable line.
4398580	4400460	He just says it out loud.
4401820	4403220	That's how like half of the people.
4403220	4406100	Yeah, it's like, OK, like guess what?
4406100	4407500	You're charming.
4407500	4409660	And then they go, God damn it.
4409660	4411700	I was trying to torpedo that role.
4411700	4413100	I became Judge Reinhold.
4414660	4419740	All right. So like now let's go to like because I think we can.
4419740	4422220	So this incredible thing happens to you.
4422220	4425820	But in tandem, you're you're because you were doing Herman's head.
4426420	4427580	Simpsons is going on.
4427580	4433220	Yes. So I'm not sure what the best organic way to get into.
4433220	4434940	There's there's two places to go here.
4434940	4436140	They're both related.
4436140	4440460	I mean, you're here because I'm a huge true crime fan.
4440460	4448100	My fiance and I listened to you and this like it's truly worth like accolades.
4448100	4453660	I mean, of all due respect to all of our guests that have true crime podcasts
4453660	4457660	and things, I mean, this is truly like a gourmet true crime experience.
4458900	4461300	The so there's that.
4461300	4464900	But it's entwined with the fact that one of the most impressive things about it
4465380	4468900	is that in the midst of this getting down to the nitty gritty
4468900	4472500	in this true crime show that you do so well, that you're a producer on.
4473620	4477940	Not in your face way, but just eventually you just you share
4477940	4480220	your story as a victim.
4480220	4482300	And so does Libby.
4483300	4485380	Zibby. Zibby.
4485380	4488700	She's now twice a victim.
4489700	4491820	Just forgot her name.
4491820	4496900	We'll edit it. The the it their harrowing tales.
4496900	4500020	It's insane. It's not it.
4500620	4504100	So I don't know where to go, because I want to talk about the nuts
4504100	4507020	and bolts of your podcast, because I think it's so admirable.
4507540	4512540	And it's so disconnected from this other thing that I'm really fascinated with.
4513020	4518180	You as a human being, an actor who has experienced.
4519380	4524140	Crime. I don't know what I'm wiping it on you.
4524140	4526380	My indecision, because I don't know.
4526380	4529660	I if we go down the true crime podcast path,
4529660	4534500	I'm going to have endless questions about how you produce that show and stuff.
4535140	4539060	I just also want to talk to you about this, this story that you told.
4539260	4542020	And I don't want you to recount it because I truly believe.
4542020	4546900	I mean, it was like people need to go listen to Small Town Dicks.
4546900	4549460	What's the episode title?
4549460	4550980	Stocked. Stocked.
4550980	4556140	Where I mean, you believe me, regardless of whatever your position
4556140	4559180	in this cosmos might be, it's a fascinating story.
4559180	4563060	There's no way it's going to piss you off, offend you, trigger you.
4563380	4566780	It is just harrowing and interesting.
4566780	4569620	I think the most interesting thing about it from my perspective
4570580	4578260	is as a narcissist, how you ended up in this situation where this person
4580740	4583860	was a guy who worked on our house and was like and he just started
4584260	4587660	crossing boundaries. It was very, quote unquote, organic.
4589300	4592660	And as I described on this podcast before,
4592660	4597860	like there's a point where you describe the story and there's this theme
4597940	4601420	running under it, which is the which has come up here in this conversation,
4601420	4606460	which is about you, you've you've got to not accept anybody's help.
4607460	4609940	You're not going to go tell anybody, right?
4609940	4612940	The police, the guy that works on Herman's head,
4612940	4616100	whose job is to keep people who work on Herman's head from getting stalked.
4616100	4618180	Right. Which is a huge expense.
4618180	4621180	Shout out to the producers of Herman's head for putting them in the budget.
4621420	4622300	Right.
4622300	4625260	I thought that that would get a bigger laugh, but not a lot of showrunners
4625260	4631660	in the audience, but the like, like you choke up,
4631980	4635380	not at any point where I would expect any human being to choke up
4635380	4636340	and telling that story.
4636340	4639380	The exact point that you choke up when you're telling the story
4639820	4643420	is the point in the story where you go to get help
4644380	4647500	because you are not to put words in your mouth.
4649340	4651340	That's the point where you really get victimized.
4651340	4657620	It's not the point where this orangutan is abusing you,
4657940	4661060	stalking you, predating you.
4661060	4662940	I'm ashamed that I need to get help.
4662940	4667860	It's the point where you go to another orangutan and say,
4667860	4670580	I need you to to keep this guy.
4670580	4673620	Like, you hate yourself at that point.
4673620	4674740	Yes.
4674740	4679260	I want the thing that is the most important to talk about to me
4679620	4684460	is that that's the dark side of this other story, that you're this plucky.
4684460	4688540	I'm going to I'm going to dominate the world without anyone's help.
4688540	4689780	Right. Right.
4689780	4694740	Because there is, you know, part of, again, that duality, that
4695060	4700620	that insecurity underlying that this far from the surface is is this
4700940	4706780	is this fathoms deep well of vulnerability.
4707700	4709340	And this is what they're waiting for.
4709340	4711380	This is six year old voice.
4711380	4716180	She's going to is that like, like, was that what's going on in the back?
4716420	4718780	They're oh, everyone's going to be so fucking stoked.
4718780	4721020	If I say, oh, it's it's rough out here.
4721020	4723140	My contractor like feels creepy.
4724140	4726060	I'm sorry. Oh, OK.
4726060	4727260	I'm way off, Mark.
4727260	4731420	Like, I was trying to I was like, is the fear there that like you're like,
4731460	4735620	I just was I you know, in my family, we don't you don't
4737740	4740180	you know, you don't air your dirty laundry.
4740180	4742620	I was really waspy, right?
4742620	4744260	White Anglo-Saxon Protestants.
4744260	4747500	So you pull up your socks and you get on with it.
4747500	4749100	You just sort of keep it all together.
4749100	4752900	And so you don't show your vulnerability.
4752900	4757460	And I and I am a person of extremes, I think, in many ways.
4757460	4762260	And so when I set the bar high, I said it so high that it's not like I set it high
4762260	4764140	and I can stand on my toes and touch it.
4764140	4768020	I got to like get on a fucking trampoline and jump so high like, whoa,
4768020	4770460	you know, it's just almost out of reach.
4770460	4776100	But when I touch it, that is it's not even as much an accomplishment.
4776100	4781740	It's there's just sort of this tiny bit of relief, which is kind of fucked up.
4781740	4787820	There's very little celebration when you live with that kind of vulnerability
4787820	4791820	and you attach your and I don't do it so much anymore, thank God,
4791820	4793460	because it's a zero sum game.
4793460	4800060	But when you attach your value to what you do and to that external validation,
4800060	4802100	you're in big, big trouble.
4802100	4807420	And so if you then find yourself in a situation like that,
4807420	4810220	now you've painted yourself into a corner.
4810220	4815100	And so when I break down in that episode, there is realization that I can't do it
4815100	4819580	all myself, that feels like extraordinary failure.
4819580	4823140	Because now I have to unzip and you get to see all my insides.
4823140	4824780	And that was never the plan.
4824780	4830260	And but I tell me to back off because I'm clumsy and drunk,
4830260	4836100	but like I want I'm so fascinated by the control hatch on that interaction.
4836100	4840980	At that moment when you you're going to the to the man that said to you,
4840980	4845060	I'm paid for you to tell me if anyone gets out of line.
4845060	4847340	And then you're it's the moment where you're going to him.
4847340	4858940	And I want to know, what is the beating heart behind the shame?
4858940	4866060	That moment when you go to him and you say, I got an issue here and I need help.
4866060	4872460	Is there language you can access about so that we can market and go,
4872460	4877100	if I hear this in my head, that's not worth dying for?
4878060	4882100	Let me try to phrase this in a way that you can answer.
4882100	4883500	I'm setting you up to fail.
4885500	4889420	What was your in your primal crazy head?
4889420	4890460	Not you're not crazy.
4890460	4894300	I mean, I'm the crazy part of your primal head.
4894300	4900060	What would be the worst, if no matter how not realistic.
4900060	4907780	What would be the nightmare response when you went to someone and said,
4907780	4911460	I've been having this guy is basically stalking me.
4911460	4915100	It's gotten way out of control and I'm overwhelmed and I need help.
4915100	4917820	What would be the nightmare response from the other person?
4917820	4920020	It sort of was the nightmare response when he said,
4920020	4924180	Yardley, why didn't you tell me when he showed up at your house and
4924180	4927260	said my wife threw me out of the house, right?
4927260	4927660	Right.
4927660	4930020	Like, why didn't you tell me weeks ago?
4930980	4935500	Why didn't you, as though you knew long ago, why did you wait so long?
4935500	4937220	That's very familiar to the kids.
4937220	4941140	You know, it's sort of your fault you got yourself into this.
4941140	4941860	I'm glad.
4941860	4942460	Why didn't you?
4942460	4944180	Why were you drinking at USC?
4944180	4949180	Exactly, like you waited too long.
4949180	4954180	It's no surprise that you find yourself in this situation and
4954180	4955700	you can't handle it on your own.
4955700	4958580	Like all of the things that when you get to that point and
4958580	4962300	you have to ask for help, you realize, okay, I can't handle it on my own.
4962300	4963620	Yes, I probably waited too long.
4963620	4965500	No, I can't do it all myself.
4965500	4967300	Yes, it's okay to ask for help.
4967300	4970580	All of the things that in my life I just learned,
4970580	4973420	I hope I never have to go to those things.
4973420	4976620	I hope I never have to tick those boxes, and then I did.
4976620	4979740	And when you say it out loud, it's really no big deal.
4979740	4981140	By the way, now I'm doing it again.
4981140	4987420	Cuz I'm like, tell me about the point, but I get that now.
4988420	4991300	It's like, God damn it, I was almost fucking home.
4993300	4996140	Like how much do I have to do to prove I'm strong?
4996140	4999860	And then it's like somebody's like, no, I'm gonna fucking literally,
4999860	5001900	I'm gonna build a spider web in your attic.
5001900	5004220	And you're like, are you serious?
5004220	5007060	I have to call customer service on this?
5007060	5009300	I bought, I went Linux for a reason.
5009300	5015260	I'm a fucking, that's what I, I don't wanna say that's what I thought.
5016180	5020660	It's not so complicated, but in your head, I think, or
5020660	5027580	if you're the sort of person who spends a lot of energy trying to
5027580	5030420	make sure that nobody sees your vulnerability,
5030420	5036100	then the moment that there is a crack in that facade, it feels catastrophic.
5036100	5040660	And that, I think, and it's not true.
5040660	5044340	Cuz if this one thing isn't true about me, then what if everything could be
5044340	5045380	untrue about me?
5045380	5051220	And so, I don't think anybody else feels that way about my vulnerability.
5051220	5055380	But in that moment, it does feel like this massive failure.
5055380	5059340	Because all your life, you've been told, don't ever let anybody see that.
5059340	5061020	Well, your friend, you're a really good friend.
5061020	5062300	I assume she's a really good friend.
5062300	5063700	You're co-hosting a podcast with her.
5063700	5067060	I think, in general, you guys are so good at interviewing.
5068580	5072180	She is piping in just the right amount.
5072180	5074620	She's probably heard this story a thousand times.
5074620	5078500	And she's sort of like, yeah, but stop here for a second, Yardley.
5078500	5081580	Because she knows.
5081580	5087580	People listening to this story want you to explain, just for a second.
5087580	5090540	Are you seriously putting up with this at this point?
5090540	5094380	And it's a truly therapeutic exercise.
5094380	5096220	You guys, please listen to the episode.
5096220	5097780	It's incredible.
5097780	5099620	Is that the first episode, or is that the-
5099620	5100580	No, God, no.
5100580	5103900	Because we would never trade in that.
5103900	5106700	No, I think it's in the second season.
5106700	5109100	Somewhere buried in the middle there.
5109100	5110340	She also has-
5110340	5112620	So at some point during this true crime podcast,
5112620	5115780	this thing that's happened to you, which we were kind of vaguely referring to,
5115780	5116740	that began to happen?
5116740	5117380	Or is it something that happened-
5117380	5118900	No, it happened long ago.
5118900	5121220	It happened in the early 90s.
5121220	5124860	So at some point in second season of your Small Town Dicks,
5124860	5128420	you just started talking about that on the show.
5128420	5132740	We actually, all of our cases are told by the detectives who investigated them.
5132740	5133340	Oh, wow.
5133340	5135300	Except for two episodes.
5135300	5139060	One incident that happened to Zibi, where she was mugged,
5139060	5141340	and then that was in season one.
5141340	5144500	And we did it because the detectives, Dan and Dave,
5144500	5148940	we have two identical twin detectives on the show who co-host with us,
5148940	5150940	talked about this thing they call the Goofy Loop.
5150940	5152180	Goofy Loop.
5152180	5158260	You, like, yeah, so a cop will be on a traffic stop and be like,
5158260	5160900	get out of the car, get out of the car, get out.
5160900	5161980	And you're already out of the car.
5161980	5165180	And they just keep telling you, get out of the car, get out of the car.
5165180	5169300	And they're just sort of like so wound up, and that's called the Goofy Loop.
5169300	5174100	And so Zibi was then, we were at lunch, and she was talking about this thing
5174100	5177940	that happened to her, and they were like, you were in the Goofy Loop.
5177940	5182380	So we did this episode where it was the only one that wasn't actually told
5182380	5183740	by a detective, obviously.
5183740	5186580	And then so the next time, in the second season,
5186580	5190660	and a season doesn't actually correspond to a calendar year.
5190660	5194700	We're actually only two years old, but we do about two seasons a year.
5194700	5198060	In the second season, we did this episode
5198060	5202020	where I was stalked by this guy who'd worked on my house.
5202020	5202540	Yeah.
5202540	5205940	And you had another story before that, too, of a guy who was leaving creepy notes
5205940	5206660	in your doorway.
5206660	5208380	Yes, who was the, yes, on my front door.
5208380	5211380	I mean, it reminds me of the story.
5211380	5213020	Was it Rebecca Shafer?
5213020	5214860	Yes, which is right around the same time.
5214860	5215340	You were.
5215340	5219460	When I actually auditioned for that part, I went to the network for that role.
5219460	5225580	You kids, who aren't my age, like, yeah, it's like, it was this young actress
5225580	5234060	who, her murder kind of changed the landscape of stalking rules
5234060	5238860	here in our great state of California, where it was like, all right, enough
5238860	5240300	is enough.
5240300	5246340	This woman was absolutely stalked and murdered in, like, plain sight.
5246340	5250460	Like, this guy just decided he wanted to kill her, and there was no way.
5250460	5256620	There were, it changed a lot of stuff, and it's a really tragic story.
5256620	5258500	And it was happening at the exact same time.
5261380	5265660	I'm just morbidly curious, was it happening at the exact same time
5265660	5269660	in the sense that, were you, had Rebecca been killed
5269660	5272580	when you were enduring some of this shit?
5272580	5278460	When did she, my thing happened, I think hers happened after mine,
5278460	5288540	because mine happened in, like, 93, it happened around the same time, roughly.
5288540	5290460	I'm so bad with dates, I'm sorry, I don't remember.
5290460	5295220	Yeah, no, I measure things by Emmys.
5295780	5302580	That was after my 30 Emmy, and 9-11, that was before 9-11, that was after 9-11.
5302580	5310300	So, like, my 37th birthday was halfway between 9-11 and my second Emmy.
5310300	5311620	Dan, you're not relatable.
5311620	5313980	I don't care.
5313980	5316220	I don't need to be relatable.
5316220	5318820	I'm a living God.
5318820	5321380	I may also be super drunk.
5321380	5323100	So, let's get into the true crime of it.
5323100	5327900	I really think, because it's like, the audience is like,
5327900	5329460	I hate true crime, I hate true crime.
5329460	5330060	Go ahead.
5330060	5331900	Do you hate true crime?
5331900	5334740	A lot of them, well, they're just saying that.
5334740	5337140	Because they love you, and that's one of the things.
5337140	5340580	Like, you and your partner have, like, created the show.
5340580	5344700	So, here's the reason why this is an amazing show.
5344700	5347060	So, true crime, what you might be used to,
5347060	5351740	and I think this is a great art form, is total amateurs in an armchair
5351740	5355540	hanging out going like, hey, well, here's what I think about John Bonet Ramsey.
5355540	5359740	That's fucking great, and I live by it.
5359740	5363500	But you are also a fan of that art form.
5363500	5370820	But you, inexplicably, have created a truly responsible and professional show
5370820	5372980	that I would truly recommend to anybody.
5372980	5376460	I wouldn't bother to preface it by going, do you love true crime?
5376460	5380100	Because I'd be like, you must love film noir,
5380100	5383660	or you must love, like, just the idea of anything.
5383660	5386460	I mean, I think it's the only true crime show I've ever heard
5386460	5390540	that I think cops could listen to next to victims, for instance.
5390540	5396820	Cop, we get a lot of messages, emails, reviews from cops saying,
5396820	5400980	this is amazing, thanks so much, thanks for telling it from our point of view.
5400980	5405660	So, like I said, all of our cases are told by the detectives who investigated them.
5405660	5409540	And it started because I'm friends with Dan and Dave,
5409540	5411540	these identical twin detectives.
5411540	5416500	And they are one, investigated violent crimes,
5416500	5421020	and one investigated sex crimes and child abuse.
5421020	5425740	And to just hear them talk about their day was the most harrowing,
5425740	5433620	extraordinary, mind-blowing, like, Tuesday is so much more
5433620	5436340	incredible than my any ever day.
5436340	5439540	Imagine being interrogated in stereo by twin detectives.
5439540	5441020	Seriously.
5441020	5444100	I wonder if they ever, I mean, wasn't that one of the first questions you asked?
5444100	5446140	I'm like, have you guys ever done a dead ringers?
5446140	5447820	They actually have.
5447820	5451220	What's funny is when, because they live obviously in the same town,
5451220	5456580	so they have had criminals say, fuck you, to one of them,
5456580	5458900	and like, you don't mean me, you mean my brother?
5458900	5462100	Yeah, you're like, no, you mean my brother, right?
5462100	5465460	Me as a criminal, how do I know which is the good cop, which is the bad cop?
5465540	5466940	Right?
5466940	5469460	These guys, though, it is remarkable.
5469460	5473420	And also, all of your guests, but most, like these two guys,
5473420	5480180	these anonymous detectives, they, to put it in D&D terms, these guys are like.
5480180	5480660	Thank you.
5480660	5489740	Like, I try to, they're paladins.
5489740	5493340	The paladin class is like, it's not the one everyone chooses.
5493340	5498980	I don't want to ride around in a suit of armor on a white horse, and like, go.
5498980	5502340	And it already sounds like I'm trivializing it, because the more important
5502340	5508180	thing is in this sort of dragnet archetypal sense, God, it's so,
5509620	5510980	God, I'm all over the place.
5510980	5513100	Here's where I'm going to start with this.
5513100	5518580	As an American citizen, I think my worst fear about cops,
5518580	5521700	including homicide detectives, was realized by Mark Furman.
5522060	5525740	Even from Wisconsin, it was sort of like, didn't we all think that that's how it
5525740	5532420	worked, that, and worse than thinking that this is what detectives are,
5532420	5535340	it's actually more about, this is what we think of the world.
5535340	5539620	Because we would assume, I don't want to do that job.
5539620	5544740	And so if this guy does that job, and he's racist, then maybe that job makes
5544740	5548620	you racist, and it toxifies everything.
5548620	5553900	And it's so different to hear these guys who are like,
5553900	5555620	I have no idea what they look like.
5555620	5556580	They're anonymous.
5556580	5559740	You guys keep their identity secret, which adds to the charm.
5564300	5567820	You can't be that by the book and that candid.
5567820	5572420	They sit there with you guys, and they interview other detectives.
5572420	5577260	Couldn't I just Google identical detectives and find out who these guys are?
5577260	5582420	You could, but we actually say in our opening, while some of our listeners
5582420	5586260	may recognize some of these cases, we hope that you'll join us in keeping
5586260	5591220	their identities secret to protect the victims and what they've been through.
5591220	5594740	And so are all the cases that these two have worked on themselves?
5594740	5595260	No.
5595260	5597940	So they're just giving their insight on cases?
5597940	5599140	No.
5599140	5600580	Sorry.
5600580	5603660	So we do cases that Dan and Dave have investigated.
5603660	5608300	We also have guests from other small towns who come and tell us cases
5608300	5614020	that they have investigated, and Dan and Dave, because they are of the brotherhood,
5614020	5617260	are there to comment and sort of weigh in as well.
5617260	5618660	Gotcha.
5618660	5622740	What's incredible is, I mean, you guys are so restrained,
5622740	5626020	but then it's like listening over the seasons, you guys learn phrases,
5626020	5628660	and then two seasons later, you're like, well, yeah,
5628660	5630260	but wouldn't that be equivocally-dibbly?
5630260	5630740	Yes, yes.
5630740	5632420	And they're like, well, that's a very good point.
5632420	5633380	Thank you, thank you.
5633380	5636260	In this case, in our district, you're not allowed to do equivocally-dibbly.
5636260	5638140	Oh, OK, fine, just checking.
5638140	5642860	But more importantly, it's Dan and Dave who are like,
5642860	5647940	it's like you could never get cops to host a podcast.
5647940	5648980	Right.
5648980	5652940	It would be a terrible podcast, because they'd be like, hey, I'm Dan.
5652940	5654300	I'm Dave.
5654300	5656260	We're hanging out.
5656260	5656780	I don't know.
5656780	5659220	I'm sure it'd be great.
5659220	5660860	No, but you know what's interesting?
5660860	5663180	So originally, the concept of the podcast
5663180	5667460	was Dan and Dave would just talk to each other over a glass of scotch.
5667460	5668420	Which would be fine.
5668420	5671340	And it wasn't fine.
5671340	5676220	Because they were, first of all, sometimes you put a microphone in front of somebody,
5676220	5679580	and they sort of freeze up, and they don't know quite what to do.
5679580	5684660	And suddenly, with scotch, it got all a bit slurry in about 40 minutes.
5684660	5685820	So that wasn't a podcast.
5685820	5687020	I won't tolerate that.
5687020	5688580	And so.
5688580	5690380	That is a podcast killer.
5691180	5692740	Where's the professionalism, Dan?
5692740	5695580	So anyways, where's the bird's answer with that?
5695580	5698580	Oh.
5698580	5699300	Give me one second.
5699300	5702660	I have to go solve the crime of Jeff has to pee.
5702660	5705460	I already know who'd done it, and it's me.
5705460	5709060	And it was in the master bedroom of my pants.
5709060	5709820	Continue, please.
5709820	5711620	I'm so sorry.
5711620	5716580	So then they said, we need you and Zibi to ask us questions.
5716580	5717260	Wait, OK.
5717260	5719220	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
5719300	5720900	They tried it by themselves.
5720900	5721500	Yes.
5721500	5722020	Well, we were there.
5722020	5722940	You didn't put them up to it?
5722940	5724500	No, we were all there.
5724500	5727500	Zibi and I, because we were like, OK, we'll produce it.
5727500	5728940	And you guys will just be you guys.
5728940	5730580	You were like, you should have a podcast.
5730580	5731860	We should not be talking about it.
5731860	5732340	Correct.
5732340	5733900	Because I'm the voice of Lisa Simpson.
5733900	5734860	It'll only fuck things up.
5734860	5735380	Yes.
5735380	5740700	And then they pressed record, and they're like, OK, so what about that perp?
5740700	5741740	Yes.
5741740	5743740	And you guys are like, OK, how do I put this?
5743740	5744740	Anyway.
5744740	5745380	I love it.
5745380	5747620	They were actually the ones who were like, this doesn't work.
5747620	5749900	Of course, because they're paladins.
5749900	5750900	They're good guys.
5750900	5752140	They're wonderful guys.
5752140	5753100	They're great guys.
5753100	5756860	And I will say, and to your point about Mark Furman,
5756860	5759180	one of the things that I love about our podcast
5759180	5763100	and it's been a sort of unexpected treasure about it
5763100	5766660	is that while there is certainly a really worthy conversation
5766660	5771980	about the really horrible things happening in law enforcement
5771980	5774780	in this country, I would say 99% of them
5774780	5776980	are actually trying to do their very best.
5776980	5779940	And if we have an opportunity to shine a light on those people
5779940	5783540	as well, that's also part of the conversation.
5783540	5787620	And these guys all say, and the women, that it's a calling.
5787620	5789020	It's not a job.
5789020	5794820	And so I really, they really, really, really
5794820	5798100	are going the distance to do it right and do it well.
5798100	5802540	And we have cases about, we have a really fantastic four-part series
5802540	5805420	called The Sociopath and the Whistleblower about a bad cop,
5805420	5807300	who was a bad cop for 10 years.
5807300	5808620	That's fucking credible.
5808620	5810780	And it rocked this town.
5810780	5813300	Isn't that when our Dan or Dave, isn't there
5813300	5816140	the protagonist of that or no?
5816140	5820380	No, that's a guy named Lieutenant Scott who investigated that.
5820380	5823060	We did, we have a great, have you listened to the interview?
5823060	5827220	So we have another great two-part case called Presumed Guilty.
5827220	5830700	And then that's in season two about two guys
5830700	5836020	who were sent to prison for a crime they ended up not committing.
5836020	5839060	And then we did an interview with one of those guys
5839060	5841900	who had been in prison for eight years this season.
5841900	5844580	But not on the phone, right?
5844580	5846300	No, he's sitting with us.
5846300	5848940	Yes, thank god.
5848940	5851020	I mean, I know people's lives are important,
5851020	5852700	but the audio quality.
5852700	5853540	I know, I know.
5853540	5854020	I feel you.
5854020	5856660	Oh my god, with the true crime with the, oh,
5856660	5859020	so what's it like to be the mother of Jeffrey
5859020	5860260	Dahmer's 12-victim?
5860260	5869260	I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to.
5869260	5872620	I love it in the booth.
5872620	5874380	Zach is adjusting you right now.
5874380	5876820	Like, well, maybe if you're nice to the sound engineers,
5876820	5880260	you'll get better sound, motherfucker.
5880260	5884020	It is such a profound thing, though, to hear these guys.
5884020	5885780	And they all strike a similar silhouette,
5885780	5887460	but some of them are so different.
5887460	5888940	There's the guy who's like, well,
5888940	5891100	I'm the guy that shows up when there's an arson.
5891100	5893900	But also, that's why I like know more about skin burns.
5893900	5896300	But some of them are crass.
5896300	5897540	Some of them are polite.
5897540	5899740	Some of them are afraid to be profane.
5899740	5903460	Some of them are, what really comes across
5903460	5907940	is that if any of these guys, in spite of how kind of maybe
5907940	5912860	stoic the job demands that their personalities be,
5912860	5915260	I am socially conditioned to believe
5915260	5920580	that if a barrel chested, as I picture all of them,
5920580	5923060	a man with a notepad and a gun on his hip
5923060	5925460	that he's allowed to kill anyone he wants with,
5925460	5929460	that when that guy's being stoic,
5929460	5932180	he's hiding the fact that he's racist, homophobic,
5932180	5935940	misogynistic, that he wishes that the filth in the street
5935940	5937180	could blah, blah, blah.
5937180	5938780	It'd be rained out.
5938780	5941860	And it is so therapeutic to listen
5941860	5945060	to just the simple dragnet reality.
5945060	5947700	These guys often refer to dragnet moments.
5947700	5950300	Because what they do is so clerical.
5950300	5953380	They move from address to address.
5953380	5955220	And they keep careful notes.
5955220	5958140	And I love the rule of law, being
5958140	5959700	the protagonist in these stories.
5959700	5961220	Yes, they're very methodical.
5961220	5965260	And we actually always also try to get into the like,
5965260	5967740	who are you as a person?
5967740	5969940	Why do you do what you do?
5969940	5972740	And then how do you, if you are the person who
5972740	5974900	goes toward all of the stuff that the rest of us
5975380	5977900	run from, where does that live inside of you?
5977900	5979380	We always, always ask that question.
5979380	5982220	Is it because you're a terrible person?
5982220	5983860	Or is it because you're a hero?
5983860	5985100	How do you do it?
5985100	5986180	It's debugging.
5986180	5989180	I think I got from this guy that we call Asperger Detective
5989180	5991220	on this show because he has a true crime podcast.
5991220	5995100	It was just him and a microphone and his crazy brain
5995100	5997340	like doing an awesome job of talking
5997340	5998900	about famous murder cases.
5998900	6003900	But he really woke me up to like the healthy reason
6004420	6007460	why I think that maybe true crime is a fascination
6007460	6012180	which is sort of a debugging of our experiment
6012180	6013620	with being a society.
6013620	6016500	Like because you've got a couple different leads
6016500	6017340	coming in.
6017340	6019580	You've got the cops that are showing up.
6019580	6021780	You've got the victims that are showing up.
6021780	6023620	You've got the perpetrators that are showing up.
6023620	6026700	And you're looking at it with your little Ghostbusters lens
6026700	6030620	and going, okay, which of these things went wrong?
6030620	6033780	And we tend to get drawn to the famous things.
6034620	6037140	I'll talk about John Bonet Ramsey for a million years
6037140	6039100	because it's endlessly fascinating.
6039100	6041780	But your podcast is like,
6041780	6044180	there are a million small towns in America.
6044180	6047740	All of them have big crimes constantly happening in them.
6047740	6049900	And then all of them have a homicide detective
6049900	6053980	who shows up who is like, this is like,
6053980	6056540	and you guys do a really good job.
6056540	6058260	You're good interviewers.
6058260	6060740	I wish you were doing this podcast.
6061660	6066420	It takes the effect of this VR experience
6066420	6068860	because these guys, they're like,
6068860	6070260	you're like, so what happened first?
6070260	6073500	And they're like, okay, so I got a call from third in Lincoln
6073500	6077380	and I saw the door, first thing I noticed,
6077380	6079740	door's got water damage.
6079740	6081420	And it just goes from there.
6081420	6084700	I mean, if you don't like it, you're a piece of shit.
6085900	6089500	Even if you hate crime or love it,
6089500	6092140	I don't know what kind of, it really is a good podcast.
6092140	6092980	Thank you.
6092980	6094140	How do you produce it?
6094140	6095340	Are you part of a network?
6095340	6096180	I'm not.
6096180	6097740	No, actually we do it.
6097740	6101580	We're a tiny team, Zibi and I edit on paper
6101580	6103500	and then we pass it off to two editors
6103500	6105700	who put it into Pro Tools.
6105700	6108460	It's an incredibly edit heavy podcast
6108460	6110580	because we're not dealing with professional storytellers.
6110580	6113780	Okay, so you guys aren't that amazing people
6113780	6114980	and they're that thoughtful
6114980	6116820	because that would be too intimidating
6116820	6118260	because I was gonna ask that.
6118260	6119100	What do you mean?
6119980	6121900	He thought you were doing it in one take
6121900	6123740	like without any editing.
6123740	6125260	Your questions are so thoughtful
6125260	6126980	and you're never interrupting
6126980	6128300	and being a big drunken idiot
6128300	6131140	and you're just editing it all out.
6131140	6134900	We actually have now learned to,
6134900	6137340	the thing about interrupting, what's interesting is
6137340	6140700	we used to interrupt, no, we used to interrupt more.
6140700	6141860	Let me stop you right there.
6141860	6145180	This is a pro interrupting show.
6146100	6147540	That's right, go ahead.
6147540	6150100	And Dan and Dave said to us,
6150100	6151980	they pulled us aside literally
6151980	6156220	and said when these detectives are telling these stories,
6156220	6158900	it's often like they're testifying on the stand
6158900	6162060	and it's much better just to let them go.
6162060	6164180	And if you have questions, write them down
6164180	6166340	and then come back to them afterward.
6166340	6168940	If there's a natural break, you can ask the question
6168940	6173300	but it's less good to sort of try to get one in.
6173300	6177140	It doesn't, their brain, it's just not like that.
6177740	6179060	I mean, that is.
6179060	6179900	It's funny.
6182540	6185140	I love hearing that for several reasons.
6185140	6188700	One is that I love the idea that the men and women
6188700	6190420	that we put in charge, and nine binaries,
6190420	6193780	that you're welcome, that we put in charge
6193780	6196660	of that really specific tier of law enforcement
6196660	6198540	where the crime's already happened,
6198540	6201540	now they gotta, the paper trail begins
6201540	6203380	and they gotta find the perp.
6203380	6205300	I think they're called perps.
6205780	6208260	I'm so much more comfortable with the idea
6208260	6211620	of them being not natural performers.
6211620	6214540	I would really like them to have Asperger's.
6214540	6216140	I would really like them to be like,
6216140	6217860	no, I'm more of a detail-oriented person.
6217860	6219580	They really are very detail-oriented.
6219580	6221580	They're very organized that way.
6222940	6226380	So yes, to your point, we're very edit-heavy.
6226380	6231380	They, it's just, there's repetition.
6233060	6233900	Here's my thing.
6233940	6236060	The most important minute is the next minute.
6236060	6239340	And so you don't want your audience to turn away.
6239340	6240780	You don't want them to turn you off
6240780	6242380	and go and do something else.
6242380	6247060	And so I really have tremendous respect for our listeners
6247060	6249980	and I want my podcast to be clean.
6249980	6250820	That's just my thing.
6250820	6251860	I mean, if you don't listen to it now,
6251860	6253980	you're a piece of shit.
6253980	6256460	She just said, the most important minute
6256460	6258020	is the next minute.
6258020	6260380	That means every minute's more important than the next.
6260380	6261980	Fuck you people, you don't get it.
6262980	6264980	I hope you don't listen to it
6264980	6267180	because it sounds like it'll make you better.
6268380	6270180	And you deserve to be worse.
6271260	6272380	Thanks for coming, Yardley.
6272380	6274380	I'm so sorry about the audience.
6275740	6278300	I think they're drunk, frankly.
6278300	6282060	Who have you been beefing with about people that don't like,
6282060	6282900	are people getting on me?
6282900	6285060	I don't know the ghost of my dad.
6285060	6286220	Who isn't even dead.
6286220	6287380	That's how drunk I am.
6288260	6291260	You're just imagining that people are mad at you
6291260	6292100	for loving your crime.
6292100	6293540	Yes, that's called shame.
6293540	6295540	I was just talking around functions about this
6295540	6298380	on his better podcast today
6298380	6301260	because he was doing a better job of interviewing me.
6301260	6303860	No, no, compare and despair, don't do it.
6303860	6305780	Compare and despair?
6305780	6306620	God damn it.
6306620	6307940	Brandon, how are you doing?
6307940	6310180	I'm trying to tell you, she dropped and,
6310180	6311780	you know, you should listen.
6311780	6315620	How do you, uh, we, oh.
6316620	6317940	We should ask about,
6317940	6320620	activist was one of the ways that you described her.
6320620	6323380	Oh yeah, I guess I do want to know, yeah.
6323380	6324940	But can I ask one quick one?
6324940	6328580	Oh yeah, go ahead, Brandon, yeah.
6328580	6329700	I'm being shrubbed.
6332540	6333820	Tis an honor.
6335100	6336860	What's the coolest thing
6336860	6339540	that your job has allowed you to be able to do?
6339540	6344540	Um, the coolest thing that my job is,
6347300	6348140	has allowed me to do,
6348140	6350900	it has given me freedom of choice.
6350900	6353340	And I really, and I said that it's,
6353340	6355700	and now actually, I used to always say that,
6355700	6357020	and I said that to Matt Selmon,
6357020	6359340	who's one of our executive producer writers the other day.
6359340	6360820	I know Matt.
6360820	6362500	And he's so funny and smart.
6362500	6363900	Dave, shut the fuck up.
6364940	6366340	I was a Simpson.
6367020	6369740	Fuckin' guy.
6369740	6373580	And he said, oh, so you mean you have money?
6373580	6377380	And I'm like, yes, money is a part of it,
6377380	6379500	but it is so much bigger than that.
6379500	6383580	And then, so here's a story about freedom of choice.
6383580	6386380	Three years ago, I broke my neck.
6387300	6388620	That's a terrible choice.
6390500	6391940	Just be quiet for a second.
6391940	6394340	I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
6394340	6395740	I'm so sorry.
6396020	6396860	This is a good story.
6396860	6399780	It was funny, it was funny.
6399780	6402900	Not worth interrupting, but it was funny, technically.
6402900	6404020	Technically.
6404020	6407820	So it was a really, really, really bad break.
6407820	6409580	And I came within a millimeter
6409580	6412180	of being paralyzed from the neck down.
6412180	6413220	Can I ask how it happened?
6413220	6416420	I fell down a flight of stairs in a parking garage.
6416420	6418900	And I separated C-5 and C-6
6418900	6420180	and stretched my spinal cord
6420180	6421940	to within a millimeter of snapping.
6422860	6423700	So.
6423700	6426220	And that would have meant paralysis for probably life, right?
6426220	6427060	Oh, yes.
6427060	6427900	Or death.
6427900	6428740	Or death.
6428740	6430500	Or superhero.
6430500	6431340	Dan?
6431340	6432180	Origin.
6432180	6433740	Dan.
6433740	6434860	I'm trying to put a point here.
6434860	6435860	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
6435860	6436980	It'll be short.
6436980	6437820	All right.
6437820	6438660	So.
6438660	6439500	Now would you talk longer?
6439500	6440780	I want the show to be good.
6442300	6445740	So it took me a full year to recover.
6445740	6448900	Now, I'm lucky because I have good health insurance,
6448900	6452500	but what I really had was time.
6452500	6457500	And I had time because I have this amazing job.
6457540	6462540	And what I realized is that even the thing that nobody has,
6466660	6470900	the thing that nobody, it was time.
6470900	6474220	That I could go to physical therapy five days a week.
6474220	6475900	And it wasn't about the money.
6475900	6477460	It was that I could go
6477460	6480300	because I didn't have to be anywhere else.
6480300	6483900	And so that is about the freedom of choice.
6483900	6487060	And the other thing I always say is,
6487060	6489620	if I have this extraordinary opportunity
6489620	6491260	that this job has given me,
6491260	6494180	if I don't have the wherewithal to do something with that,
6494180	6495780	then that's on me.
6495780	6497020	Then I'm the asshole.
6497020	6497860	So.
6497860	6498680	Right.
6498680	6499620	That's the best thing.
6499620	6503180	Yeah, the idea of waking up in the morning
6503180	6506220	and knowing that the reason you're getting out of bed
6506220	6509180	is somehow intersecting with you wanting to.
6509180	6510020	Yes.
6510020	6511140	Instead of having that fallback
6511140	6513580	that we're all too familiar with, which is like,
6513580	6514940	well, I gotta quit smoking.
6514940	6517380	Well, I'm a smoker, but I gotta quit smoking.
6517380	6519420	And you fall into that trap of like,
6519420	6523060	okay, so I'm living in two totally different realities.
6523060	6525140	I'm getting out of bed because my alarm clock rung
6525140	6527780	and I'm a dishwasher, so I'm gonna go wash dishes.
6527780	6530460	It's absolutely not what I wanna do.
6530460	6532780	And that's how 99% of us live.
6532780	6534060	And we call that work.
6534060	6536020	And we call that paying the rent and stuff.
6536100	6538980	And so that's 1% of us have this privilege.
6538980	6540660	It's an enormous privilege to,
6540660	6544640	if you're gonna spend so much of your time at work,
6544640	6548180	then hopefully it's something that you enjoy because.
6548180	6549940	And hopefully you'd be able to like come down
6549940	6551620	from that Mount Sinai and be like,
6551620	6554340	hey, everybody that had to wash dishes,
6554340	6556060	otherwise they'd lose their house.
6556060	6556900	Right.
6556900	6560820	I get to jump out of bed in the morning
6560820	6564020	knowing that I'm stoked about what I do.
6564020	6565860	And I just wanna let you know, it's not that great.
6566580	6567900	It also sucks.
6567900	6569580	Fuck off.
6569580	6571980	And that would still be an uplifting message.
6571980	6575260	Okay, I guess you guys didn't receive that.
6575260	6578500	I mean, it doesn't have to be like,
6578500	6579540	oh, I'm sting.
6579540	6581620	I love doing what I love.
6581620	6584940	Like, I think it can also be inspirational to hear
6584940	6586780	people go, you know what?
6586780	6590100	I got a million dollars for taking a shit on a paper plate.
6590100	6592380	I feel bad about myself.
6592380	6595300	I think that can be really uplifting for poor people.
6596700	6601060	And then that second question was about activism.
6602740	6604100	Let's move on to that.
6604100	6607580	What is, what's the LGBTQ activist stuff
6607580	6608420	that you're looking for?
6608420	6610940	Well, Jeff, it's part of the gay thing.
6610940	6611940	Oh, sorry, you're asking her.
6611940	6613180	Okay.
6613180	6615020	My answer was gonna be stupid.
6615020	6616540	For a really long time,
6616540	6621540	I, so when California voted against gay marriage,
6622540	6626660	I was, I had just actually produced a movie
6626660	6630100	that Dustin Lance Black had directed called Virginia
6630100	6634740	that Jennifer Connolly and Ed Harris had starred in.
6634740	6638660	And he introduced me to Chad Griffin,
6638660	6643460	who at the time had just teamed up with Rob Reiner.
6643460	6646860	And they started the American Foundation for Equal Rights
6646860	6648500	to overturn Proposition 8.
6648500	6650420	And they came to me and said,
6650460	6654300	Yardley, we need to fight this fight and we need money.
6654300	6655660	And I said, I'm in.
6655660	6660220	So that was my first really, really big push.
6660220	6665220	And I was one of the major donors for that.
6666420	6669980	And then Chad got poached from, once we did that,
6670860	6675860	the American Foundation for Equal Rights went away.
6676180	6679140	And Chad got poached to the human rights campaign.
6679140	6681140	And then I sort of followed him there
6681140	6684500	and supported them there.
6684500	6686420	And I actually was just honored there
6686420	6688220	this last spring at their gala
6688220	6692100	as you got the National Leadership Award
6692100	6694580	for supporting the LGBTQ community.
6694580	6696140	Wow.
6696140	6697220	Now there's something,
6697220	6699860	there's another one of them,
6699860	6702180	I'm sure your hundred answers for what your job
6702180	6703940	has afforded you to be able to do
6703940	6706940	is to become like a donor to these things
6706940	6708260	and a philanthropist.
6708260	6710420	Yes, you know, I'm a quiet donor.
6710420	6713700	I actually, I don't, I rarely, I'm not a flashy donor.
6713700	6717180	I give quite generously, but I never need to be,
6718580	6721540	I don't never need my name in lights about that.
6721540	6724340	And it's funny, so when I had to give this speech
6724340	6727700	about being recognized by the human rights campaign,
6727700	6730260	I got a big laugh when I said,
6730260	6732180	so I've been agonizing for months
6732180	6735940	about how to thank you for thanking me properly
6735940	6738420	for doing this, I'm like, thanks,
6738420	6740420	because now I've not slept since Christmas.
6740420	6743380	I mean, it was really, I mean,
6743380	6745300	I was incredibly gratified,
6745300	6747780	but I also felt like I really don't,
6747780	6750700	I don't need you to, I don't need it, I'm good.
6750700	6754100	Like they personally are always so gracious towards me,
6754100	6757220	but they really, really, really wanted to do it publicly.
6757220	6762220	And so I recognized that part of being gracious
6762660	6764420	is allowing people to say thank you.
6764420	6767580	And so I accept that.
6767580	6769540	Obviously they're not gonna just never thank you
6769540	6770940	and never want to honor you,
6770940	6771980	but they should have a, like,
6771980	6773140	they should come to you and say,
6773140	6775180	hey, we're they're gonna throw you this big event
6775180	6777620	where you get to get up and agonize over a speech,
6777620	6780500	or we'll just, you get to know
6780500	6782140	that we want to do that for you.
6782140	6784980	And you can flip that coin and go whichever way you want.
6784980	6787540	I wish, but they were not giving me that option.
6787540	6790340	They were like, you will get up there.
6790340	6792340	I think it's important actually,
6792340	6793980	whether you like it or not,
6794980	6797500	that the strategic benefit of,
6797500	6799340	because someone like me,
6799340	6800900	who would do it for the wrong reasons,
6800900	6802900	is like, hey, I want that.
6802900	6804380	I think it's important.
6804380	6805220	I think it's important.
6805220	6806460	You would donate to these great causes
6806460	6807300	just so you could have a little gallon of this.
6807300	6809980	I would do great causes for very wrong reasons.
6809980	6812540	No, but I do think that,
6814620	6817380	that idea of deflecting compliments being like,
6818460	6820660	somebody's saying thank you,
6820660	6822500	and then how you react to that,
6822500	6825540	it's like your instinct being to be like,
6826620	6828300	almost like fuck you.
6828300	6829140	It's rude.
6829140	6834140	Because if you did something nice for any other reason
6834780	6835700	than to be nice,
6835700	6838140	then that person that's actually thanking you
6838140	6842740	is arguably an enemy in your pineal gland.
6842740	6843860	You're like, shit.
6843860	6847980	And then, I had a therapist had to explain to me.
6847980	6848940	No, it's part of it.
6848940	6849780	You have to be-
6849780	6852020	They're just telling you that they're happy
6852740	6853580	that you did a thing.
6853580	6855020	And part of it is you have to receive it.
6855020	6857580	So get over it and receive it.
6857580	6859220	It's part of the deal.
6859220	6861140	I'm gonna help some bad people.
6861140	6861980	Are you good?
6861980	6863740	Like, in a smaller way, are you good at-
6863740	6866860	Well, not you, not anymore.
6866860	6870740	Are you comfortable with small compliments in general?
6870740	6872140	Do you accept them easily,
6872140	6875260	or is it difficult to even accept little compliments?
6875260	6876420	Let's test it, let's test it.
6876420	6877260	Don't even answer.
6877260	6878100	What, Dan?
6878100	6878940	Shut up.
6879940	6881700	Jeff, you're a piece of shit.
6881700	6882540	Thank you.
6884660	6885860	Okay, he's pretty good.
6888580	6890460	I feel like I am.
6890460	6892860	Whatever happens internally,
6894380	6896620	and it really can be sort of day to day.
6898940	6901020	I was almost late today, tonight,
6901020	6903580	because I couldn't get out of my closet,
6903580	6906020	because I changed clothes like five times.
6906020	6907900	You chose well, this butterfly dress is rocking.
6907900	6908740	Thank you.
6910500	6911460	And it's-
6911540	6912940	See, she did it, thank you.
6912940	6913780	We got it.
6913780	6914980	But you kind of took it,
6914980	6916780	you kind of bowed your head, you wanna thank you.
6916780	6917620	I-
6918900	6921220	Did part of you think in your head,
6922460	6926580	fuck you, this butterfly, did you have to translate it
6926580	6927980	to the second language of-
6928980	6930740	No, I don't think so.
6930740	6932580	I just, but it's,
6932580	6935140	I'm, you know, I'm just sort of,
6935140	6939060	I'm a complicated little critter in there, sometimes.
6939060	6943060	But I recognize, now I like,
6943060	6944780	compliments are fine, I'm good with it,
6944780	6945860	I really am good.
6945860	6950860	I just honestly knew that I just really didn't need
6952860	6954980	that big, big recognition.
6954980	6959220	I was really okay with Chad and Chris Baron,
6959220	6961780	who runs the foundation under him.
6962820	6965140	They're always, like I said, so personally gracious.
6965140	6968580	I was like, that is so enough for me, I am good.
6968580	6970580	But they were insistent, so I had to step up.
6970580	6971860	Is there a specific turn of phrase,
6971860	6972980	and I'm not seeing this globally,
6972980	6974380	because it's like, I think I,
6974380	6977500	like, like, is there something that someone can say,
6977500	6980540	like, is there something that performers,
6980540	6983220	people that want attention,
6983220	6986500	like, did you hear something from them
6986500	6988980	that made, that, through that gear?
6988980	6991220	And you're like, oh, that's what I wanna hear.
6991220	6992500	And I don't actually need to hear it
6992500	6995660	from 250 million people on Twitter.
6995660	6997540	I actually need to hear it from two people
6997540	7000820	who are, like, running this charity drive.
7000820	7002100	That's a good question.
7002100	7004300	I don't know if there's a, that's a dumb question.
7004300	7005140	Don't even.
7005140	7007420	Do you have one, Dan, that you wanna hear?
7007420	7010420	You know, I think it's fucking, like, you're a good person,
7010420	7012020	but it's like, if someone said that to me,
7012020	7013620	I'd be like, well, you're a liar,
7013620	7015580	and you're a piece of shit, I'll never trust you.
7015580	7017660	I'm gonna hit you in the head.
7017660	7021660	You know, it's funny, I often joke that I work for biscuits,
7021660	7024500	that I'm sort of like a dog, I respond to biscuits.
7025180	7028740	So I do like to know that I did a good job.
7028740	7031380	I like that, I really do, I work very hard.
7031380	7033300	I like to know that I set the bar high,
7033300	7035660	I touch the bar, and that you recognize that.
7035660	7037900	I'm glad you were here, that's my thing.
7037900	7038780	Thank you.
7038780	7040860	Oh, no, no, no, no, that's what I wanna hear.
7040860	7042540	I'm saying it to you, too.
7042540	7043700	I'm glad you were here.
7043700	7044780	Thank you. That's what it is.
7044780	7046020	I'm happy to be here.
7047020	7047980	It's kinda cocky.
7049820	7051700	Let's give it up for you, it's a joke, everybody.
7051700	7053540	Thank you so much.
7054540	7057060	That's a terrible ending, that's a terrible ending.
7058860	7060420	I'm glad you guys are here.
7061420	7062580	Thank you so much.
7062580	7064740	Let Yardley know you're glad she was here.
7066100	7067020	Thank you.
7067900	7069580	I'm gonna say best guest ever.
7071940	7073060	I'd say so.
7073060	7075620	Brandon Johnson, Spencer Critton, and I'm Jeff Davis.
7075620	7077020	Your mayor is Dan Harmon.
7078220	7079220	Thank you, Yardley.
7079220	7080460	Thank you for everything that you're doing,
7080460	7083220	and thank you for making us so happy for so long.
7083220	7084060	Thank y'all for coming.
7084060	7085380	Drive fast, take chances.
7106980	7108060	Did you get any of that?
7109460	7111380	It's a good show.
7113220	7114220	It's a good show.
