0	18440	Hello, Cranmercy Theatre, the New York Comedy Festival!
18440	20040	I have a very good feeling about this.
20040	25960	Ladies and gentlemen, from New York City, in the great state of New York, Harbinetown
25960	26960	is now in session.
26960	36120	Let's bring out the mayor of Harbinetown, Dan Harbin!
36120	44540	Are you kidding?
44540	53520	Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
53520	58600	What do you...
58600	66320	Oh, oh, Jeff, Jeff, you wanted a, uh, all right.
66320	67320	That makes it...
67320	68320	Thank you, Arturo.
68320	70320	Do I owe you money, Arturo?
70320	71320	Yeah.
71320	75720	I'm being surfeited with gifts right now.
75720	80400	Yeah, Aidan, this is a real pad, not your Nintendo bullshit.
80400	83480	What the fuck is going on?
84480	85480	Hello, New York.
85480	86480	Thank you so much for...
86480	91800	I couldn't be happier.
91800	92800	You're wonderful people.
92800	93800	I hope you're very...
93800	94800	I hope you're comfortable.
94800	100760	And, uh, I just, we're so honored and flattered, particularly, like, we, you know, we're sold
100760	107200	out tonight and we're sold out tomorrow night and I hope that I really, really, really,
107200	109080	I mean, you know, it's like, it's crazy.
109080	110080	This theater is cool.
110080	111080	The Ramones play here?
111080	112080	This place is sexy as hell.
112080	115680	Yeah, well, every time, yeah, we've never, we've never had a bad experience in New York,
115680	119680	so let's, uh, let's, let's, let's, it's time to break that pattern.
119680	120680	Let's jinx it.
120680	124960	But it's, it's obviously flattering, it's like, it's, it's the capital of the world,
124960	128920	you know, so the people are, like, when they're excited that you're coming to visit them,
128920	131360	it feels legitimizing.
131360	134720	We're very happy that people like us in Los Angeles, but let's face it, those people are
134720	135720	fucking nincompoops.
135720	136720	Yeah.
136720	138680	Like, they don't know what they're doing.
138680	139680	They're crazy people.
140280	143920	They're from the Midwest and they go out to a desert and they're like, just draw things
143920	146640	and they expect to get paid for it.
146640	152120	You guys are, like, fucking dealing with reality, like, 9-11's happening over your shoulder
152120	157800	and you're, and you're like, yeah, but still, Dan Harmon showing up would be good.
157800	162240	And that's a huge compliment, uh, because, like, getting to work without being stabbed
162240	166440	is a big deal for you guys, so, like, you, you have, and, and also, like, there's cats
166440	169000	going on.
169000	170000	You have shows.
170000	171000	These people have...
171000	172000	You mean the play cats?
172000	173000	In L.A., you can't, you can't...
173000	175000	Cats close in, like, 89, dude.
175000	176000	It doesn't matter.
176000	179920	If enough, if they said they wanted it back, they'd make more cats.
179920	185280	I, I, I'm gonna guess, I swear to God, I bet I'm right, I bet there's a Night Rider show
185280	187560	on Broadway right now.
187560	189440	Because if they want it, so be it.
189440	192400	There's a Spider-Man, he's dangling all over the place.
192400	194600	There's a Harry Potter show on Broadway.
194600	198200	These guys, what I'm saying is, they can do whatever they want.
198200	202400	And so a hug from you really is twice as valuable as everyone that we've ever said
202400	203400	we liked.
203400	211000	I, I really, like, you guys are, we've, we've sucked Portland's dick, we've, uh, we, we,
211000	214400	we've been to Austin and we've said, this is the best town in the world, like, honestly,
214400	219440	I hope those people aren't listening right now, but it's all been a lie.
219440	224800	Even in our own home, uh, we don't like those people as much as we like you.
224800	227920	You guys are good, good, good, good people.
227920	228920	So thank you.
228920	230440	Glad we got that out of the way.
230440	232080	Now on to the show, which we don't have.
232080	233080	There's no show.
233080	234080	We don't, I don't know.
234080	235080	We've never had a show.
235080	236080	We tried to have a show.
236080	240640	For the first three Harman Towns, we, before we recorded it, we tried to think about guests
240640	241640	and what we're going to do.
241640	242640	And then we just said, fuck it.
242640	243640	Let's just get drunk.
243640	244640	I did scribble some notes.
244640	245640	I got some notes.
245640	246640	Oh shit.
246640	247640	Yeah, yeah.
247640	248640	All right.
248640	249640	So I, I, I, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
249760	253400	and try to understand that I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, III.
253400	254560	The applause for the, yeah.
254560	255560	Yes.
255560	256560	Yes.
256560	257560	He has a speech impediment.
257560	258560	No.
258560	259560	It's true.
259560	261440	I thought you, you, you thought that was CG.
261440	264780	I just, you know, you're in there singing it.
264780	266600	Oh, he really, he's like this, the King speech.
266600	267600	It's yeah.
267600	271180	Oh, it's, I can see his lips flapping.
271180	275220	You all thought the Fair Audio, uh, edited or, like, remixed to the fair.
276220	277720	You're seeing it, it's a real thing.
277720	281120	Do you believe in life or...
281120	284000	No, it's real.
284000	286020	We also auto tune.
286020	293100	I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, II.
293100	294240	Are you stuck?
294240	295520	No, I'm trying to...
295520	296520	Okay.
296520	299360	Well, now when I do it, now when I do it, I'm hearing it and I'm sorry.
299360	301440	Don't apologize.
301440	302440	That's beautiful.
302440	303440	And that's another thing about New York.
303440	304600	By the way, have we talked about this?
304600	306240	New York is the nicest fucking town.
306240	307240	Everyone had...
307240	308240	I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, II.
308240	309240	Here's what it is.
309240	313820	I came out and plugged in my, my iPod or a phone, whatever you call it, and a dude brought
313820	314820	me drinks.
314820	315820	It's the best place in the world.
315820	317420	It's, well, because it makes sense.
317420	321100	If you told somebody from Mars, you'd go, guess which is the most polite city?
321100	324620	Do you think it's the one where everyone's stacked on top of each other?
324620	329080	And that if the lights go out, they're five seconds from cannibalism?
329080	333220	Like, do you think those people know their P's and Q's?
333220	336120	The immersion would go, yeah, I, I would bet my money on that.
336120	338900	I would think that the people in Nebraska would turn out to be racist.
338900	341900	What was the year when the lights all went out and everybody had a million babies?
341900	342900	2003.
342900	343900	Okay.
343900	347060	It was the 70s though.
347060	348060	77.
348060	349060	77, this guy says.
349060	350060	2003, too?
350060	351060	No, that was...
351060	354860	Why do the lights keep going out in this fucking city?
354860	359060	Because they need power to do what they do.
359060	360060	They're wonderful people.
360060	362260	The lights are controlled by big condom.
363260	365980	Well, there was that night that, yeah, it was like...
365980	369260	But who isn't, for that matter?
369260	370260	Whatever.
370260	377620	But honestly, nicer people here, nicer encounters, because everyone has to be, well, more versed
377620	378620	in politeness.
378620	385460	A gal in the third row said, fuck you.
385460	387540	It's her first night here.
387540	388540	She's fuck her.
388540	389540	She's from Austin.
389540	390540	She's from Austin, Texas.
390540	391540	But you know what?
391540	393500	We love her here, and we accept her.
393500	398220	And she could be the senator of New York tomorrow, if we so chose.
398220	399220	Senator.
399220	404460	Okay, so I'm just looking at my notes, and I'm trying to...
404460	408860	So on the plane, I spilled some chili on my shirt.
408860	410300	You had chili on the plane?
410300	411780	And I found out...
411780	415740	What flight serves chili?
415740	419580	Jet blue, if you need to know.
419580	420580	Chili?
420620	422020	I'm just expressing incredulity.
422020	426740	Well, it's not like a big pot of it, and it looks like a guy going, whoo-hoo!
426740	428740	Who wants more chili?
428740	430900	Like, oh, crawdad coming out.
430900	435340	Don't get distracted by jet blue's menu.
435340	440020	I spilled some shit on my shirt, and I was like, oh, shit.
440020	444220	And I only brought one shirt for five days for...
444220	445220	Because you're a professional.
445220	448660	So it's like, once there's chili on it, it's like there's chili on it the whole time.
448660	450420	And so I was like, oh, man.
450420	455660	And then Dino said, put some salt on it.
455660	462980	And then I took some salt, and I put it on it, and I started rubbing, and I guess you
462980	467340	guys probably can see that it probably didn't all go away, but there was chili all over
467340	470380	my shirt, and it worked.
470380	471380	And I was like scrubbing it.
471380	473020	I'm like, oh, is that the abrasion?
473020	477020	And then I was talking to Jeff about it, and he's like, oh, that's why soda water works.
477020	486820	And I was like, soda, sodium?
486820	494100	I didn't know that for 42 years, sodium, soda water.
494100	495300	I didn't know that.
495300	496300	It's very exciting.
496300	497300	It's super exciting.
497300	504060	Like, a little club soda will get that out, because it has salt in it, because the ions
504060	513460	are hungry for chili, but they're exciting to learn things.
513460	516740	Didn't you learn this in the same table at the same restaurant where you've had other
516740	520860	epiphanies about stuff that you didn't use to know?
520860	521860	About the courtesy flush?
521860	522860	Well, okay.
522860	523860	All right.
523860	524860	So thank you.
524860	525860	So we could call this a segment.
525860	526860	Do you want to give it a theme song?
526860	527860	This is...
527860	533300	I didn't bring my iPad.
533300	534620	We're limited tonight.
534620	537980	Well, this is stuff that I've learned at 42.
537980	539980	I'm going to turn that down a bit.
539980	540980	Do you want to...
540980	541980	Go ahead.
541980	542980	Because it is kind of exciting.
542980	543980	And there's two more.
543980	544980	Oh, yeah.
544980	546420	So do you want to give it a theme song for real?
546420	552660	Dan Harmon learning things that he should have learned when he was younger.
552660	557860	Dude, the crowd has gone wild.
557860	558860	Yeah.
558860	559860	I know.
559860	561500	They're being very nice.
561500	563020	I thought that was terrible.
563020	567540	I think if we come to a different city, we should...
567540	571220	Dan Harmon is the world's coolest guy.
571220	574820	What is it?
574820	576380	What is that?
576380	577980	That song is a wall of...
577980	578980	I know.
578980	579980	Again, it's a real...
579980	581700	I think it's our friend Titanic Sinclair.
581740	584020	Well, no, I'm not questioning his talent.
584020	585020	I'm just...
585020	586460	That song is just a wall of sound.
586460	587460	I know.
587460	588460	I try to turn it down.
588460	589460	It's very loud.
589460	590460	Well, it's not about lowering the volume.
590460	591460	It's about picking a song that has a...
591460	592460	Hang on.
592460	593460	Hold your horses.
593460	594460	A beginning.
594460	595460	I'm going to pick another...
595460	596460	Okay.
596460	597460	Ready?
597460	598460	What's the segment called?
598460	599460	You pick a title.
599460	600460	Dan Harmon...
600460	601460	No.
601460	602460	You know what?
602460	603460	It's not about me.
603460	619380	Sometimes you learn things even though you've been alive for 40 years.
619380	622860	It's not too late to learn.
622860	625540	Mammals brains harden.
625540	631020	That's why sometimes you have a kitten that fetches and then you tell your friends, my
631020	632660	cat plays fetch.
632660	637700	And then the cat doesn't fetch anymore because its brain gets hard.
637700	644260	And that's most mammals, but Ben Franklin was 75 going out in the rain and like, what
644260	646620	will happen?
646620	652620	Because we are eternally children and our brains are soft.
652620	657780	And that also results in racism and...
657780	658780	That's been our show.
658780	659780	Thanks for coming.
659780	660780	Ready, Ben.
660780	661780	Murder.
661900	663900	But we're eternally at play.
663900	669620	We're like, well, what would happen if I hated that guy because he's black?
669620	672500	But also what would happen if I flew a kite in the rain?
672500	680380	Hey, if you like these lights, maybe you should hate black people.
680380	683660	Should that segment theme song have its own segment theme song?
683660	684660	Yeah.
684660	686060	No, that would be...
686060	689060	That went wrong.
689140	692500	I'm going to assume Ben Franklin was racist because he didn't know any better.
692500	697340	But that, you know, if you're black and you're listening and you like electricity, don't
697340	700700	be conflicted.
700700	703260	There's room in the world for all of us.
703260	704260	And there's not...
704260	705580	I don't think we should accept...
705580	709060	I think I implied that if you like electricity, you should hate black people.
709060	714820	And that's not the case at all.
714820	716020	The opposite is the case.
716020	717900	If you like electricity, you should love...
717940	721180	Well, you shouldn't love anybody because of their color.
721180	725380	That would be as racist as if you hated them.
725380	726820	You guys are from New York.
726820	729460	You know this.
729460	731540	Don't love people because of the color of their skin.
731540	732860	That's fucked up.
732860	739460	Like, there are bad people who are different skin-wise.
739460	745300	And if you just love them for their skin, you're a racist and you will pay the price
745300	749900	because they'll come to your house and go, hi, I'm purple and everyone hates me.
749900	750900	Can I come in your house?
750900	754460	And you'll be like, oh, no, I love purple people.
754460	757420	And then he's like, stab, stab.
757420	761860	Like you deserved it.
761860	768180	Are you running for the Republican nomination right now?
768180	771980	Because you're making a hell of a lot of sense over there.
771980	772980	All right.
772980	774180	Well, you know what?
774180	777380	I'm saying what they're thinking.
777380	778380	Is that guy going to win?
778380	779380	He's not going to win.
779380	780380	Okay.
780380	781380	All right.
781380	782380	Let's talk about that later.
782380	783380	Okay.
783380	786020	Is that the salt and the sodium?
786020	787660	But we're in the segment.
787660	788660	He's on target.
788660	790380	He'll never lose the target.
790380	793220	I get a little drunk when I come to New York.
793220	796100	Just two more things about me learning things when I'm 40.
796100	799220	So 42.
799220	801020	The soda is sodium.
801020	802220	Here's the new one.
802220	804100	You brought up courtesy flush.
804100	807540	So I never knew what courtesy flush meant.
807540	811540	I always thought it meant you poop and then you flush twice.
811540	815420	I was like, how is that a courtesy to anyone?
815420	820780	I never, I was like, do they mean like, because there's poop flakes in the water?
820780	822660	Like that's a courtesy?
822660	826620	Like if you poop and then what you see in the toilet.
826620	830740	This one goes out to the ladies in the house.
830740	834380	If what you see demands a second flush, that's not a courtesy.
834380	840060	That's gross and you should hate yourself and flush second time because there's extra
840060	843780	poop because your butt has more poop than a toilet guy.
843780	845740	That's what I thought courtesy flush meant.
845740	850500	Courtesy flush, as you already know, and which I just learned, it means halfway through
850500	860780	your poop, you reach back and flush your poo poos while you're still pooping.
860780	862020	I didn't know that.
862020	866540	I just learned that and I had to come to New York to learn that because New York has no
866540	867540	like space.
867540	869260	You guys could have gone to St. Hamilton tonight.
869260	872980	You could have gone, we're learning shit here at the Gramercy.
872980	875900	Because every, every, every place here, it's like, you know, it's a three foot bathroom.
875900	878060	And Dan, have you put the courtesy flush into play?
878060	879060	Have you used that now?
879060	880060	No, I haven't done it yet.
880620	884780	I'd safe to say at this age, I don't think I'll learn that habit.
884780	888940	But I'm still, I'm very charmed by the concept.
888940	893740	Okay, one more thing and then we're done with this segment.
893740	898020	So here's, okay, so this is going to blow your fucking mind.
898020	900500	Buckle your holy shit belts, everybody.
900500	903180	I just found this out in the Rick and Morty writers room.
903180	905420	So I'm not even sure how to, yeah, thank you.
905420	906420	Thank you, kids.
906420	907420	Thank you.
907420	908420	Yeah.
908420	909420	Yeah.
909780	913540	These people, these people love writers rooms.
913540	917540	Yeah we're in that writers room, we're working it up.
917540	920340	You guys are mostly topless, like you guys are shirts off most of the time in that writers
920340	921340	room.
921340	922340	Yeah, it's shirts, whatever.
922340	923340	Yeah.
923340	927260	The, okay, so here, this is fucking insane to me.
927260	928820	I don't, okay, so.
928820	930460	I have no idea where this is going.
930460	938780	Okay, so, so you guys know the catchphrase, nobody puts baby in the corner, in a corner,
938780	939820	right?
939820	956020	So for the last five, eight years, like I thought that line was from the movie Million
956020	962380	Dollar Baby.
962380	964340	She was in the corner, a lot of that movie.
964340	965340	It makes sense.
965340	966340	I've never seen the movie.
966340	967340	It's part of being a boxer.
967340	974420	I know that Clint Eastwood teaches a Million Dollar Baby to fight, and spoilers, I've
974420	976580	never seen the movie.
976580	981300	I know she gets put in a corner and dies.
981300	982300	I know that.
982300	990140	I also know how Death of a Salesman adds, but I, like I, because I, two reasons, and
990140	995460	when I walk you through this, you're going to go, Dan, I forgive you, and I'm actually
995460	998900	kind of mad at a society that did this to you.
998900	1005100	The first thing is, I think this is just a distortion of my perception, because apparently
1005100	1011140	that line is from Dirty Dancing, which I've seen the one and a half times that we've all
1011140	1016220	seen it, the first time through when you're trying to impress someone, and the half time
1016220	1019540	when you just fall asleep and you're hoping it holds up.
1019540	1026860	And apparently, apropos of absolutely nothing, Patrick Swayze walks up to Jennifer Grey and
1026860	1029700	says, nobody puts baby in the corner.
1029700	1031500	Now, isn't her dad that says that?
1031500	1033020	Her father says it about her.
1033020	1034020	Oh, right.
1034020	1035020	The plot thickens.
1035020	1036020	The plot thickens.
1036020	1037020	Okay.
1037020	1040700	You know what, garbage movies, by the way.
1040700	1042340	Her dad says it about her.
1042340	1045940	Swayze says it about her too, her dad.
1045940	1049060	I'm so glad we got this fucking sorted.
1049580	1050580	Drinks around the house.
1050580	1053940	Drinks around the house, Bart.
1053940	1061180	I think her dad says in the movie, he says, I don't want you dancing with that dirty dancer.
1061180	1062180	Go in the corner.
1062180	1066820	And then he goes over to her, and he goes like, I'm sorry, nobody puts baby in the corner.
1066820	1071220	By the way, your name's baby, and get out of the corner.
1071220	1072460	So here's the thing.
1072460	1076220	I saw that movie, I don't remember that line, I don't think it was a big deal.
1076220	1078900	It's not like Macaulay Culkin going like this.
1078900	1081820	It's like the point in the movie where you're like, this is great.
1081820	1084700	It's a dumb movie, and that's just another dumb part of it.
1084700	1085700	Right?
1085700	1086700	No, it's a great movie.
1086700	1089380	Did anyone here write Dirty Dancing?
1089380	1090380	You did?
1090380	1091380	Okay.
1091380	1092380	These guys wrote it.
1092380	1093860	It's a dumb movie.
1093860	1096580	These two 24-year-olds wrote Dirty Dancing.
1096580	1104660	It's a dumb movie, and honestly, anyone who wants to challenge me on that, I will...
1104660	1108140	Who here is strong enough to do the lift and have Dan go up like Jennifer Grey?
1108380	1110060	Do we have somebody strong enough to do the lift?
1110060	1112420	No, we're going to do that down this aisle, yeah.
1112420	1113420	But that doesn't...
1113420	1116300	We're going to end the show with somebody doing the Dirty Dancing lift and going down
1116300	1117300	the aisle.
1117300	1118500	So the other...
1118500	1120260	So here's the other thing that happened.
1120260	1122340	Remember this is the end with Seth Rogen?
1122340	1123340	Yes.
1123340	1127620	So his buddy in the movie is in that million-dollar baby movie, right?
1127620	1128620	Right.
1128620	1129620	I forget his name.
1129620	1135620	So in the movie, Seth Rogen says to his friend, he says, nobody puts baby in the corner, and
1135620	1136620	the guy kind of chuckles.
1136620	1141180	Like, it's his way of seducing his friend into going to the Hollywood party.
1141180	1142180	And like...
1142180	1146140	So that guy was in million-dollar baby, and then Seth does that joke.
1146140	1147140	And so I...
1147140	1148140	That's what...
1148140	1152260	What was that guy in million-dollar baby?
1152260	1153260	Wasn't he in that movie?
1153260	1154260	I don't.
1154260	1155260	Okay.
1155260	1156260	Well, I haven't seen it.
1156260	1161140	I may have also made that up, because I haven't seen the movie.
1161140	1166140	So I picture Clint Eastwood teaching Hilary Swank how to box, and then that guy's like,
1166140	1169940	hey, I love being in the corner.
1169940	1171940	Let's move on.
1171940	1173020	But it's just that's...
1173020	1174500	I thought you'd enjoy that.
1174500	1175780	You can learn things after 40.
1175780	1178300	You promised that minds would be blown, and I think you proved it.
1178300	1180300	I think that you accomplished it.
1180300	1181900	Yeah, I thought...
1181900	1186820	Every time someone said, nobody puts baby in the corner, I've always pictured Clint Eastwood
1186820	1191060	talking to Hilary Swank on a hospital bed.
1192060	1195420	I never pictured Patrick Swayze talking to him.
1195420	1199060	What if he said that in that movie, but he was referencing Dirty Dancing?
1202060	1203060	Yeah.
1205060	1207060	By the way, both movies, garbage.
1209060	1210060	You know?
1210060	1212060	Dirty Dancing is a game.
1212060	1215060	Dirty Dancing tackles abortion, it tackles teen pregnancy.
1215060	1218060	I wrote 28% of Monster House.
1219060	1225060	If I tell you a movie's bad, you fucking listen to me.
1225060	1228060	Okay, so I was masturbating today in the hotel room.
1230060	1232060	This is how most of Dan's stories start by the way.
1232060	1235060	And I had a conference call.
1237060	1239060	Is that why you started masturbating?
1239060	1244060	I was on the bed, and I was like, I want to masturbate.
1245060	1251060	And I thought of the person that I wanted to masturbate to, and I...
1251060	1252060	Hilary Swank.
1252060	1260060	And I Googled around, and I found the image, and I was like, okay, I'm masturbating.
1260060	1264060	And then there was a conference call, and I was like, okay, but I'm going to masturbate
1264060	1268060	for five minutes, and then I'll get on the conference call.
1268060	1273060	But then they changed the dial-in number.
1273060	1278060	So then I was masturbating, and there was like an intern calling me.
1279060	1283060	And she was on the phone, and she's going, hey, we changed the dial-in number.
1283060	1289060	And I was like, I had literally my penis in my hand.
1289060	1293060	And I was like, okay, well, can you... okay, what's the...
1293060	1296060	And she's like, oh, I'll email it to you, okay.
1296060	1299060	But I don't really have a point to the story.
1300060	1305060	I mean, what it made me think of was, like, she didn't know I was...
1305060	1310060	Like, she didn't know she was talking to a man that was, like, doing this.
1310060	1314060	I think if you're a woman and you call a man, you should just have that assumption already in your head.
1314060	1315060	Well, that's...
1315060	1318060	The guy's jerking off on that call.
1318060	1323060	But when Erin, my former wife, when she worked at 1-800-DENTIST,
1323060	1328060	like, she would say... she said, you know, a big part of her job was, like,
1328060	1331060	you would answer the phone and go, 1-800-DENTIST.
1331060	1335060	And then the guy would go, yeah, I want to get a dentist.
1341060	1343060	A dentist real bad.
1343060	1347060	Okay, sir, do you have an insurance provider?
1347060	1348060	What?
1348060	1351060	What?
1351060	1353060	And it was, like, a big part of her job.
1353060	1355060	It was, like, a prevalent thing.
1355060	1361060	That, like, there were guys that were, like, clearly masturbating when they...
1361060	1365060	And the idea of talking to a person.
1365060	1368060	But the thing that I don't...
1368060	1370060	Like, they kind of... because this happened to me.
1370060	1372060	And I was like, oh, I'm...
1372060	1378060	This person, like, doesn't know that I'm kneeling at a New York hotel bed
1378060	1382060	looking at a photo of, like, a girl from a commercial.
1384060	1385060	What was the commercial?
1385060	1387060	I'm not saying. I'm not saying.
1387060	1388060	Don't say 1-800-DENTIST.
1388060	1391060	I'm not saying because I have not verified her birth date.
1394060	1398060	I will get... those records are sealed
1398060	1404060	until we officially verify that she was born after 1980, whatever.
1404060	1406060	The cigarette date is.
1406060	1411060	But, like, believe me, she's on the bubble.
1412060	1414060	Jesus Christ.
1414060	1416060	Hey, you know what?
1416060	1418060	You should have said it was flow from the progressive.
1418060	1422060	Yeah, you know, I should have said lots of stuff, but I didn't.
1423060	1426060	I should have... I should have done...
1426060	1429060	The Wright brothers should have taken a car.
1431060	1433060	But they didn't.
1434060	1437060	I'm equating my horrible...
1437060	1441060	Your latent perversion to the birth of the invention of flight.
1442060	1445060	But how did they know when they were out there going, like,
1445060	1447060	what if a car could fly?
1447060	1450060	I bet people were driving by and going, like,
1450060	1452060	Gross!
1453060	1455060	Go home to your wife.
1455060	1457060	Age inappropriate.
1458060	1460060	And they would have called out, you know,
1460060	1463060	Taco Bell put her in the commercial for a reason.
1464060	1466060	Oh, so we got it. It was Taco Bell.
1466060	1468060	No, it's not. I made that up. I made it up.
1468060	1469060	I made it up.
1469060	1470060	No, I made it up.
1470060	1471060	We don't know that.
1471060	1472060	To protect myself.
1472060	1474060	You were joking after a while.
1474060	1476060	Go to a Taco Bell girl. You're not going to find her.
1476060	1479060	I'll tell you. I'll tell you next week.
1479060	1480060	Tell us the commercial, Dan.
1480060	1481060	All the time.
1481060	1484060	Your whole gimmick is full disclosure, Dan.
1484060	1486060	Tell us what commercial you were joking after.
1486060	1489060	But my whole gimmick is not full disclosure if she's 17.
1492060	1496060	I saw the commercial. I made a mental note of it.
1497060	1499060	I called her image up.
1499060	1501060	I am a grown man.
1501060	1503060	I'm in charge of my life.
1503060	1505060	NBC Universal called up.
1505060	1508060	I had my pants around my ankles.
1508060	1510060	I had my wiener in my hand.
1510060	1513060	It's tiny. I'm powerless.
1513060	1515060	But I'm a bad person.
1515060	1518060	It's funny to me that there was a person who was like an intern going like,
1518060	1520060	okay, hold on for, I'm giving you the thing.
1520060	1522060	And I'm like, okay.
1522060	1523060	So I was just thinking like...
1523060	1524060	So what happened then?
1524060	1527060	Did you go on hold and stop jerking off or did you continue the process?
1527060	1529060	Of course I stopped. It like shriveled.
1531060	1534060	But only because I was like, I didn't go there in my head.
1534060	1536060	Because the person on the phone was over 17 years old.
1536060	1537060	Is that why?
1537060	1538060	Jeff.
1538060	1539060	What?
1539060	1540060	You know, Jeff.
1540060	1542060	Am I connecting the wrong dots, damn.
1542060	1543060	Jeff.
1543060	1545060	You're the bad person here.
1545060	1548060	Well, because what I was thinking was, oh, this is interesting.
1548060	1551060	Because I remember Erin's stories about when she worked for 1-800-DENTIS,
1551060	1553060	how there were the people who would call her.
1553060	1556060	They were clearly getting off on...
1556060	1558060	The interesting thing to me is like the question of...
1558060	1560060	There's some people who are...
1560060	1563060	They're getting off on the idea that you...
1563060	1564060	It's an assault.
1564060	1569060	That they want you to know.
1569060	1570060	And then I started...
1570060	1574060	I was like, wait, but what if your thing was that they didn't know?
1574060	1576060	What if you just called people and were like,
1576060	1580060	hey, I was wondering, should I get a new swimming pool?
1580060	1583060	Well, sir, I'm looking through my things
1583060	1585060	and the whole time you're jerking off.
1585060	1589060	Like, is that a fetish and how would you ever know?
1589060	1591060	Because that would be the whole point.
1591060	1593060	Because the guy would be like...
1593060	1596060	Hello? I just love swimming pools.
1596060	1599060	I was just thinking. I didn't go there.
1599060	1602060	How many listeners do we get in Harmon Town a month or a week?
1602060	1605060	What's the ballpark figures in that?
1605060	1607060	It's 10 million.
1607060	1609060	So we've got to assume, there's at least...
1609060	1611060	Five million women.
1611060	1613060	And you're saying we just lost them.
1613060	1617060	No, I'm saying if the number is over a million and it's over a few million,
1617060	1622060	certain people are jerking off right as we speak right now.
1622060	1624060	How many people here at the Gramergy Theater
1624060	1626060	are currently jerking off in the shadows?
1626060	1629060	That's nearly half of the crowd. I love that.
1629060	1631060	Well, that's sort of the Pandora's box I was hoping.
1631060	1633060	How many of you are jerking off somebody sitting next to them
1633060	1634060	as the more important...
1634060	1636060	All right, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
1636060	1637060	That matters more than anything.
1637060	1639060	Okay. All right.
1639060	1642060	Uh...
1642060	1643060	If somebody brought me a drink over there,
1643060	1644060	they can certainly jerk me off.
1644060	1645060	Courtesy flush.
1645060	1647060	Salt stains, phone jerking.
1647060	1649060	Soda is sodium.
1649060	1651060	Nobody puts me in the corner.
1652060	1653060	Poop pants.
1653060	1655060	It says poop pants, let's dance, Bowie.
1655060	1658060	Oh, because that was last night and you were in a blackout drunk
1658060	1661060	and we were at a bar and let's dance was playing.
1661060	1662060	Let's dance.
1662060	1664060	And so I started singing poop pants,
1664060	1667060	and then you were certain that tonight,
1667060	1669060	if we sing the song, let's dance,
1669060	1671060	but use the lyrics to poop pants,
1671060	1673060	that it would be podcast dynamite.
1676060	1679060	Sounds like I was...
1679060	1681060	Sounds like on paper I was right.
1681060	1682060	I believe so.
1682060	1683060	Poop pants.
1683060	1687060	Put on your brown shoes to match your pants.
1687060	1691060	So no one knows poop pants.
1691060	1693060	Let the poop go.
1693060	1697060	When I say run, that means I have the runs.
1697060	1698060	Yeah, that's my favorite part,
1698060	1700060	is that when it goes into the cosmic prayer,
1700060	1705060	it's like, when you poop, you poop your pants.
1705060	1708060	My ass feels like a flame.
1710060	1712060	Poop pants.
1712060	1717060	Put on your special brown shoes so no one sees.
1717060	1719060	Poop pants.
1719060	1723060	No one will notice if you wear enough brown pants.
1723060	1727060	I remember we were doing that drunkenly at a bar last night
1727060	1729060	and you said, Jeff, stop, sorry,
1729060	1731060	got to write this down, got to write it down.
1731060	1732060	Poop pants.
1732060	1735060	And you said, I'll never know what that means tomorrow.
1735060	1738060	I said, write down David Bowie's plus dance.
1738060	1739060	Okay, great.
1739060	1740060	That worked really well.
1740060	1741060	Yeah.
1741060	1745060	Okay, so I don't suppose you have a 411 on this.
1745060	1748060	I just have the word sandwich.
1748060	1750060	The inventor of the sandwich.
1750060	1751060	This is today.
1751060	1755060	We were talking about Woody Allen.
1755060	1757060	Woody Allen, either Side Effects or Getting Even
1757060	1759060	or one of his books, not without Fetters, I don't think.
1759060	1762060	It was a bit about the role of sandwich.
1762060	1765060	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1765060	1767060	And you wrote it down.
1767060	1768060	I'm not going to tell you.
1768060	1770060	I'm not going to tell you what it is.
1770060	1773060	You had something fucking good for the sandwich a bit.
1773060	1776060	Yeah, but I feel like, okay, so I guess Woody Allen.
1776060	1778060	Do we need our guests out here for this?
1778060	1780060	Well, yeah, we'll bring them out in a second.
1780060	1782060	Just let me get, okay, one more thing.
1782060	1786060	A guy called me, a guy mistook me in a bar today.
1786060	1789060	I had my back to the guy and he came out of the bathroom
1789060	1793060	at the spring lounge and he came out of the bathroom
1793060	1797060	and he saw me from behind wearing this jacket
1797060	1803060	and he went, Mr. Grossman?
1803060	1805060	And I turned to him and he's like, oh, I'm sorry.
1805060	1808060	And I was like, this is a big step for me.
1808060	1814060	Like, if you're 25, you're never mistaken for Mr. Grossman.
1814060	1816060	That's like a big, that's a threshold.
1816060	1820060	But whenever, even if your name's Shiv Grossman,
1820060	1822060	someone's gonna go Shiv.
1822060	1827060	But I was mistaken today for a man called Mr. Grossman.
1827060	1829060	And then I pressed the guy for details
1829060	1833060	and it's a cartoonist from The New Yorker.
1833060	1835060	So I was like, I'll take it.
1835060	1836060	I'll take it. I like it.
1836060	1837060	Now, do you Google his image?
1837060	1838060	Do you look, do you assemble Mr. Grossman?
1838060	1839060	No, I don't care. No.
1839060	1841060	Or is he just calling you a gross man?
1841060	1843060	No, don't be silly. You know what?
1843060	1844060	I don't know.
1844060	1846060	You know what? You're a terrible person.
1846060	1847060	Did you look up Mr. Grossman?
1847060	1848060	No, I didn't.
1848060	1851060	I'm not narcissistic.
1851060	1853060	I don't care. I don't care what I look like.
1853060	1855060	I just thought it was fun, you know?
1855060	1863060	And you're a racist and everyone's made of light.
1863060	1865060	Here we go.
1865060	1869060	I love millennials now. And I'll tell you why.
1869060	1871060	What do you love most about millennials?
1871060	1875060	I love them because nothing's ever gonna go their way.
1875060	1877060	I truly, like, I've come around.
1877060	1880060	I'm like, oh, my God, these poor kids, like, I fucking love you.
1880060	1882060	Like, I'm so sorry.
1882060	1886060	Like, I actually want to help you, like, try to make the world right
1886060	1888060	because it took me a while.
1888060	1892060	Please try to understand that I, for the first 10 years that we met,
1892060	1898060	like, I thought you were just an asshole because you wanted all this stuff.
1898060	1902060	And it took me, and then I realized, oh, you're never gonna get it.
1902060	1904060	And that makes me love you.
1904060	1907060	Like, I'm so sorry. I love you.
1907060	1910060	Like, you guys really have your head in the right spot.
1910060	1913060	My generation was just like, oh, let's just look at the floor,
1913060	1916060	and as long as we don't land on the moon or be the Beatles, we'll be cool.
1916060	1921060	But you guys are like, you should do everything different.
1921060	1925060	And I was like, you sound like Hitler to me.
1925060	1931060	But then after a while, they're like, you should do it all different.
1931060	1933060	You should do it different.
1933060	1936060	And I was like, but nothing different is happening.
1936060	1940060	And then I was like, aw, aw.
1940060	1943060	Aw, you little dickens.
1943060	1945060	You want everything? Nothing's ever gonna be different.
1945060	1947060	You love everything.
1947060	1949060	The earth is burning to a crisp, and you're just like,
1949060	1952060	man, you should think different.
1952060	1954060	And it's sad and beautiful.
1954060	1958060	Like, I'm on your side now that I know you'll never win.
1958060	1960060	You're Rudy to me now.
1960060	1963060	How old is the oldest millennial?
1963060	1966060	According to Pepsi.
1966060	1968060	That's not a joke.
1968060	1976060	I met with a guy from Pepsi, which fucking, like, shoot me.
1976060	1983060	I hope you like Breaking Bad, but TV is bleh.
1983060	1986060	But if it's gonna be made good, it's gonna be like,
1986060	1988060	corporations are gonna be making it.
1988060	1990060	Like, Nike's gonna make TV.
1990060	1991060	Colgate's gonna make TV.
1991060	1992060	Pepsi's gonna make TV.
1992060	1996060	Don't groan, you fucking little pieces of shit.
1996060	1997060	You like it?
1997060	1998060	You like your TV?
1998060	2000060	You like your free TV?
2000060	2006060	Nah, dear TV, I got offended today.
2006060	2009060	I thought, I like Orange is the New Black,
2009060	2015060	but I like the episode where there's too much orange in it.
2015060	2021060	Because I'm an orange person, and I don't want no, no, no, no, no.
2021060	2024060	Signed, meow, meow.
2024060	2027060	And then your letter goes...
2027060	2030060	into a toilet called, no one gives a fuck.
2030060	2034060	Thanks for your money.
2034060	2038060	But I got sidetracked.
2038060	2040060	Truthfully, the truth is, like,
2040060	2042060	Netflix is a corporation.
2042060	2044060	They may as well be Nike or Pepsi.
2044060	2047060	They're just the first corporation that noticed what you guys like,
2047060	2050060	and they're giving it to you, and that's a good thing.
2050060	2056060	Pepsi is very, very capable of making great fucking television.
2056060	2058060	Don't you laugh, sir.
2058060	2060060	At our comedy show.
2060060	2062060	Don't you dare ever laugh.
2062060	2063060	A lot of temerity.
2063060	2068060	Do you guys remember when Seinfeld told everyone to stop laughing?
2068060	2073060	Kramer was racist, and then he was that glitterman?
2073060	2076060	And then Kramer was like, I'm sorry.
2076060	2079060	He's got the hair.
2079060	2081060	I'm not racist. It's the thing.
2081060	2085060	I love Afro-Americans, and everyone's, like, laughing,
2085060	2089060	and Seinfeld goes, stop laughing.
2089060	2091060	It's not funny.
2091060	2093060	He's telling, oh, I'll take your word for it.
2093060	2096060	Seinfeld!
2096060	2101060	What the fuck, what the fucking fuck is happening?
2101060	2104060	Kramer's apologizing for being racist on letterman.
2104060	2107060	Seinfeld's out there curating the apology.
2107060	2112060	Let me know when I should laugh.
2112060	2116060	I don't want to be a bad person or anything.
2116060	2120060	Let me know when my involuntary reactions are appropriate.
2120060	2126060	Because I've got to tell you, watching all this makes me go...
2126060	2132060	It's fucking funny if I laugh, period.
2132060	2133060	Whoo!
2133060	2136060	Sorry, that sounded like I was mocking you.
2136060	2140060	But I also, I don't trust you guys.
2140060	2141060	As a generation.
2141060	2143060	New York, I love New York.
2143060	2146060	Everybody stop it. Stop laughing.
2146060	2149060	It's not funny.
2149060	2150060	It's a bad show.
2150060	2152060	I came to New York to do a bad show.
2152060	2154060	Let's all go to Broadway. Come on.
2155060	2157060	Let's bring out Dino.
2162060	2172060	Our next guest is a 10-year veteran of New York.
2172060	2174060	It's about to get sloppy.
2174060	2175060	He's my best friend.
2175060	2180060	Hi.
2180060	2183060	I'm sorry I'm not Spencer.
2184060	2187060	We're allowed to talk about Spencer, right?
2187060	2190060	My voice is gone.
2190060	2191060	Really?
2191060	2195060	We did karaoke at one of those St. Mark's sing-sing kind of joints
2195060	2198060	where you do karaoke until five.
2198060	2201060	Dino, you only did songs that were shrieking.
2201060	2204060	Well, because I can hit notes.
2204060	2205060	So I got to scream them.
2205060	2209060	You do Pink by Aerosmith better than Aerosmith as far as I'm concerned.
2209060	2211060	Because I say it like this!
2212060	2214060	Oh, by the way, absolutely...
2214060	2215060	The worst lyric song.
2215060	2218060	The worst written song, lyrically.
2218060	2220060	Pink is my new obsession.
2220060	2223060	Pink is...
2223060	2224060	Don't...
2224060	2225060	I won't.
2225060	2227060	I'm doing my impression of the song.
2227060	2233060	Pink is in my head.
2233060	2237060	Pink is a combination of yellow and red.
2237060	2239060	That's the lyrics.
2240060	2244060	Pink is kind of a flamingo.
2244060	2247060	Pink is my kind of lingo.
2247060	2248060	Very close.
2248060	2249060	That's very close to it.
2249060	2251060	Well, yeah, it's exactly right.
2251060	2252060	Fucking dumb.
2252060	2255060	If you wrote Pink for Aerosmith,
2255060	2259060	you're rich, buy a gun, and kill yourself.
2259060	2261060	I have no... I don't care.
2261060	2263060	I don't care if you're William Goldman.
2263060	2265060	In their defense, they weren't really trying.
2265060	2266060	No, exactly.
2266060	2267060	So kill yourself.
2268060	2270060	If you're 16 and you're thinking of suicide,
2270060	2272060	talk to someone.
2272060	2274060	If you wrote Pink, fucking pull the trigger.
2274060	2276060	If you wrote Pink for Aerosmith,
2276060	2278060	kill yourself.
2278060	2280060	Because you're never going to.
2280060	2282060	My challenge to you is,
2282060	2284060	blow my mind, kill yourself.
2284060	2287060	Do the right thing.
2287060	2289060	And write in your suicide note,
2289060	2291060	I wrote Pink for Aerosmith.
2291060	2294060	And I heard Dan Pan.
2294060	2296060	And you know what?
2296060	2297060	Thank you.
2297060	2299060	Because thank you, Dan Harmon,
2299060	2303060	for saying what society wouldn't say.
2303060	2305060	That I'm a dipshit.
2305060	2309060	And that I fucked up.
2309060	2312060	That I used my gift to hurt people.
2312060	2314060	Because there's little kids listening.
2314060	2319060	Pink is a kind of color.
2319060	2324060	Pink is my kind of color.
2324060	2329060	I like Pink because I like that color.
2329060	2334060	When your pink gets a new color.
2334060	2338060	First of all, Pink is the color of vaginas and penises.
2338060	2340060	Well, that lyric is in there.
2340060	2342060	That's the point of the song.
2342060	2344060	You already chewed up to say all kinds of cool things.
2344060	2345060	Well, he did.
2345060	2346060	What did he say?
2346060	2347060	Pink is the color.
2347060	2349060	It's the bing on your cherry.
2349060	2351060	No, I don't like it.
2351060	2353060	It's the bing on your cherry?
2353060	2354060	Yeah, dumb.
2354060	2356060	That doesn't scan.
2356060	2357060	It's dumb.
2357060	2361060	You also sang Beast of Verdon by Rolling Stones last night.
2361060	2363060	Thank you.
2363060	2368060	Was it you that misheard those lyrics a long time ago?
2368060	2369060	You thought it was something else?
2369060	2370060	No.
2370060	2371060	I don't know.
2371060	2373060	I definitely misheard lyrics.
2373060	2376060	Somebody thought I'll never be your pizza burning.
2376060	2382060	I'll never be your pizza burning.
2383060	2389060	I think that was Weird Al Yankovic who...
2389060	2393060	No one knows Weird Al Yankovic is trying to sing the actual song.
2393060	2394060	He's just an idiot.
2394060	2396060	Yeah, he can't remember.
2396060	2402060	Harmon, today, I don't know if you know the backlog of Harmon Town episodes,
2402060	2409060	but Dan is notoriously bad at telling jokes.
2409060	2410060	Take a bow.
2410060	2415060	You may have heard him mistell the duck joke, the Wilder's Mask joke, various jokes.
2415060	2419060	Dan, I told you the joke about the guy that cutes all over his shirt today.
2419060	2421060	You promised you would try to tell this joke today.
2421060	2423060	You laughed very hard at the bar.
2423060	2428060	You promised that you would say, I'm going to fucking do it.
2428060	2432060	Now, while Dan conjures this up in his memory and tries to get this right...
2432060	2435060	You want to tell the whole...
2435060	2436060	We already did.
2436060	2438060	We told the story of the Gabonzo Beethoven.
2438060	2439060	I never listened to this joke.
2439060	2441060	Give me a little hint about the guy puking.
2441060	2443060	The guy puking himself and the guy...
2443060	2445060	And he goes, I can't go home looking like this.
2445060	2448060	Oh, okay, okay, I got it, I got it.
2448060	2449060	I love that.
2449060	2450060	It's a good joke.
2450060	2451060	It's a good joke.
2451060	2453060	Okay, I just made me laugh at that.
2453060	2457060	You, Gramercy Theater in New York City, you have my absolute firm conviction
2457060	2463060	without fear of contradiction that Dan Harmon is going to tell you this joke.
2463060	2464060	It's going to be a goodie.
2464060	2465060	It's a great joke.
2465060	2466060	It's probably...
2466060	2468060	I would say this joke is nearly 180 or more years old.
2468060	2470060	It's a great old classic joke.
2470060	2471060	Okay, all right.
2471060	2472060	It starts in...
2472060	2475060	We take you to a bar where a joke starts.
2475060	2476060	Don't tell them where they're going.
2476060	2477060	Okay, all right.
2477060	2479060	So, a guy...
2479060	2480060	A guy...
2480060	2482060	I'm not going to look at you.
2482060	2486060	A guy goes into a bar and he goes...
2486060	2487060	I...
2491060	2492060	We'll be right back.
2494060	2495060	He goes, give me a drink.
2495060	2496060	And the bartender goes, here's your drink.
2497060	2501060	And then the guy keeps drinking and then after a while he looks at his watch
2501060	2502060	and he goes, I...
2502060	2503060	God, I'm so late.
2503060	2507060	Like, I should have gone home, like, to my wife because I love her.
2507060	2514060	And the bartender goes, are you going to be in trouble for going home late?
2514060	2515060	And the guy says, yeah.
2515060	2518060	And he goes, like, here's a trick I've learned.
2518060	2521060	So, take a...
2521060	2523060	Take this $20 bill.
2524060	2526060	That's weird that he would give it to him.
2529060	2531060	Because it seems like the guy, after all...
2531060	2533060	Like, he profited for a little...
2533060	2534060	Can we help him or no?
2534060	2535060	No, no, no, no, no.
2535060	2536060	Just...
2536060	2537060	No, I know what the...
2537060	2538060	You noticed a monument.
2538060	2539060	I'm not dumb.
2539060	2540060	Like, I was just saying...
2540060	2541060	I'm on the retelling.
2541060	2543060	I'm saying, I think this guy that we think is so stupid in this story,
2543060	2544060	I think he profited.
2545060	2546060	Well, that's...
2546060	2547060	I'm not even sure he's married.
2547060	2548060	I think he paid $20.
2548060	2550060	Well, no, not the way Jeff told it.
2550060	2551060	Okay, all right.
2551060	2552060	So, just...
2552060	2553060	Tell him the funny way.
2553060	2557060	So, the bartender says, take this $20 bill.
2557060	2558060	That's the part I'm hung up last week.
2558060	2559060	Yeah, that didn't happen.
2559060	2561060	Oh, take a $20 bill.
2561060	2562060	Why does he give him a $20 bill?
2562060	2564060	Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
2564060	2567060	The bartender says, take a $20 bill.
2567060	2568060	Your own $20 bill.
2568060	2569060	Take your own $20 bill.
2569060	2570060	Because why?
2570060	2571060	Well, I'm getting to that.
2571060	2572060	He's getting there.
2572060	2573060	I just got hung up.
2573060	2575060	I thought the bartender was giving the money.
2575060	2576060	Take a $20 bill.
2576060	2578060	Fold it up.
2578060	2579060	I don't know why.
2580060	2581060	Yeah, that's not a...
2582060	2583060	It is part of it.
2583060	2584060	No, it is part of it.
2584060	2585060	Let him tell the joke, Dean.
2585060	2586060	All right.
2586060	2587060	He said it's part of it.
2587060	2589060	Fold it neatly and put it in your pocket.
2589060	2591060	Well, Jeff likes talking.
2591060	2592060	No, it's part of it.
2592060	2593060	It is not.
2593060	2594060	It is part of it.
2594060	2595060	It's not part of it.
2596060	2597060	It is...
2597060	2598060	No, it is part of it.
2598060	2599060	Fold it neatly?
2599060	2600060	Why would you...
2600060	2601060	All right, all right.
2601060	2604060	I can't wait to find out why it was part of it.
2604060	2607060	We still haven't found out why he gave the $20 bill.
2607060	2608060	Well, the guy goes,
2608060	2612060	I'm enjoying drinking and I'm going home late to my wife.
2612060	2613060	And the bartender says,
2613060	2615060	let me tell you what to do.
2615060	2620060	Take a $20 bill of your own and fold it...
2620060	2621060	Neatly.
2621060	2622060	Neatly.
2623060	2625060	That part I don't get, but I swear to God,
2625060	2626060	that's what he said.
2626060	2628060	And put it in your pocket.
2628060	2630060	And when you go home to your wife and she goes,
2630060	2633060	why were you home so late?
2633060	2634060	It's amazing.
2634060	2636060	It's amazing how bad this is.
2636060	2637060	Leave it.
2637060	2638060	Leave it.
2638060	2639060	Leave it.
2639060	2640060	Leave it.
2640060	2641060	I'm telling the exact joke.
2641060	2647060	Say to her, say, I was at a bar and a guy puked on me.
2647060	2648060	Oh!
2648060	2649060	And...
2649060	2650060	You never said that.
2650060	2651060	And he...
2651060	2655060	Well, the joke progresses linearly.
2655060	2657060	I never said it.
2657060	2658060	Like I said, like a crawl in the beginning.
2658060	2661060	A guy will puke on someone.
2661060	2663060	Everyone's like...
2663060	2665060	You're doing great, then.
2665060	2666060	Say that...
2666060	2674060	Say to your wife, a guy puked on me and he felt so bad
2674060	2678060	that he gave me this neatly folded $20 bill
2678060	2683060	to go to a dry cleaner to get the puke washed out of my shirt.
2683060	2685060	And that's why I'm late.
2685060	2689060	It's because of the amount of time it takes to get a shirt cleaned.
2689060	2691060	But also, when I went to the dry cleaner,
2691060	2693060	for some reason I didn't use the $20.
2694060	2695060	Yeah, yes!
2695060	2698060	Which makes no sense, but that's not my fault.
2698060	2699060	Yes, it is your fault.
2699060	2700060	No, it's not.
2700060	2701060	It's not.
2701060	2703060	It's a flawed joke and I...
2703060	2706060	It's a flawed version of this.
2706060	2708060	And my passion for storytelling is revealing that.
2708060	2710060	I'm bad at telling jokes.
2710060	2713060	No, I didn't get to the punchline.
2713060	2716060	And so the thing I found delightful...
2716060	2717060	You don't say.
2717060	2722060	The thing I really liked about the joke is what happens next.
2723060	2725060	It's that this fella goes home.
2725060	2729060	And here's the thing about the joke is that you're cutting around a thing that happens.
2729060	2731060	That sometimes has to happen in comedy.
2731060	2732060	I just tell it.
2732060	2734060	That part was intentional.
2734060	2735060	I'm just sad.
2735060	2738060	Well, because he goes home and he goes...
2738060	2740060	So the bartender told him all that stuff.
2740060	2744060	He said, take the $20 and fold it and say this story.
2744060	2745060	A guy puked on me.
2745060	2747060	How should he fold it? Neatly or not neatly?
2747060	2748060	I took it and took it.
2748060	2750060	It's neatly?
2750060	2754060	So then in the joke you have to cut from that to the guy going home.
2754060	2757060	Because you're cutting around stuff that happens.
2757060	2761060	This joke takes 18 seconds to tell.
2761060	2762060	But the guy...
2762060	2763060	You cut to the guy going home.
2763060	2765060	Like a hard cut.
2765060	2768060	But you're supposed to not know how much time is passed.
2768060	2771060	That created community.
2771060	2772060	So he goes...
2772060	2775060	Because it takes a half hour to tell one joke.
2775060	2776060	Well, that's...
2776060	2779060	Yeah, that's why that joke was...
2779060	2783060	That's what it was famous for.
2783060	2789060	Hey, how come the Big Bang Theory just told me 20 jokes in the same amount of time?
2789060	2795060	Why are we exploring this guy's autism in a closet?
2795060	2799060	So the guy goes home and he says to his...
2799060	2803060	And his wife says, okay, so I'm glad you're home.
2803060	2804060	Day three of this joke.
2804060	2806060	Very important.
2806060	2807060	She's glad he's home.
2807060	2809060	And she goes, why are you so late?
2809060	2813060	And he goes, well, there was this thing that happened.
2813060	2819060	And he goes, a guy puked at me and I had to take my shirt to the dry cleaner.
2819060	2825060	And for some reason I still have the neatly folded money that represents what happened.
2825060	2827060	And she goes, why is there $40 here?
2827060	2835060	And he says, he also shit in my pants.
2835060	2838060	Still a good joke, still a good joke.
2838060	2843060	I will now tell that joke correctly.
2843060	2844060	Did I get the punchline wrong?
2844060	2845060	They didn't laugh.
2845060	2847060	You didn't set it up right.
2847060	2848060	You didn't set it up.
2848060	2849060	You didn't set it up.
2849060	2852060	The joke starts with the guy puking on himself drunk.
2852060	2853060	What?
2853060	2855060	The guy's...
2855060	2857060	The only way it makes sense.
2857060	2858060	A guy has had a bar.
2858060	2860060	He's been there all day, all night.
2860060	2861060	He's had so much to drink.
2861060	2863060	He barfs all over the front of his shirt and he just starts crying.
2863060	2866060	The bartender comes over and goes, Jesus Christ, what the fuck is happening over here?
2866060	2867060	He goes, look at me.
2867060	2868060	I've been drinking all day.
2868060	2870060	I told my wife I'd be home hours ago.
2870060	2871060	I puked all over myself.
2871060	2872060	I can't go home looking like this.
2872060	2873060	What do I do?
2873060	2874060	The bartender goes, I'll tell you what you do.
2874060	2876060	Do you have a $20 bill?
2876060	2877060	The guy says, yeah.
2877060	2878060	He goes, put it in your shirt pocket.
2878060	2879060	Hold it nicely.
2879060	2880060	Yeah, go home.
2880060	2881060	Hold it neatly.
2881060	2882060	Put it in your shirt pocket.
2882060	2884060	Go home and say you ran into an old friend from school.
2884060	2885060	He's going through rough times.
2885060	2887060	You heard his whole story.
2887060	2891060	He got really drunk, puked all over your shirt, gave you 20 bucks for the dry cleaning.
2891060	2892060	The guy goes, that's genius.
2892060	2893060	He walks home.
2893060	2894060	He's stumbling up the steps.
2894060	2897060	The wife opens up the doors, sees him covered in puke.
2897060	2898060	What the hell happened to you?
2898060	2903060	He says, I ran into an old friend and I heard he's going through some rough times.
2903060	2906060	He puked all over my shirt and he gave me $20 for the dry cleaning.
2906060	2908060	And the wife says, there's $40 here.
2908060	2910060	And he says, well, he also shit my pants.
2914060	2917060	The joke has to start with the guy puking on himself.
2917060	2919060	Well, I gotta say, he pukes.
2919060	2920060	You never said it.
2920060	2921060	You gotta say it.
2921060	2923060	You never said the guy puked on himself.
2923060	2925060	Why would someone else shit his pants?
2925060	2931060	I mean, write a story circle about this goddamn joke.
2931060	2934060	Puke, puke, puke.
2934060	2939060	Why was the money, why were you so focused on neat folding of the money?
2939060	2942060	I swear to God, I wish I had a recording of you.
2942060	2944060	I remember, I was there.
2944060	2946060	I told that joke exactly as I told it right now.
2946060	2947060	You were hungover though.
2947060	2948060	You were very hungover.
2949060	2952060	I admit to one thing is that I forgot that he puked on himself.
2952060	2953060	Yes.
2953060	2958060	Okay, so let me just now, so a guy goes...
2958060	2960060	The attention to so many details.
2960060	2965060	Dan Herman will now tell you the joke I just told you.
2965060	2967060	A guy goes into a bar.
2967060	2968060	Lay your bets right now.
2968060	2970060	He doesn't even have to go into the bar.
2970060	2971060	He's already there.
2971060	2974060	He gets so drunk, he's already there and he's like been drinking all day.
2974060	2977060	And then he pukes on himself and he goes like, oh God, I puked on myself.
2977060	2979060	I can't go home with puke on me.
2979060	2982060	And the bartender says, take this $20.
2982060	2991060	Or take 20 of your own dollars and say to your wife, like, yeah, a guy puked on me,
2991060	2994060	but he's sorry and he gave me this $20.
2994060	2996060	And the guy goes, that's good.
2996060	3002060	Cut to, because he said he walks home, but if the camera's objective the whole time,
3002060	3005060	then you're not there when he shits his pants.
3006060	3008060	That's on you.
3008060	3012060	If you can fix this joke and make him laugh harder, you're my hero.
3012060	3014060	I think he's doing it.
3014060	3015060	Oh, yeah.
3015060	3016060	Cut to.
3016060	3018060	So the guy goes home and the wife says, what happened?
3018060	3022060	And he goes, well, the person that puked on my shirt gave me this money.
3022060	3028060	And she goes, okay, why is there twice as much money as the amount of puke?
3028060	3032060	And he goes, well, also there's poop in my pants.
3032060	3034060	Why is there twice the money?
3034060	3043060	And he also wants that to be taken care of as well.
3043060	3046060	Because he's an affluent.
3046060	3049060	Why is there twice as much money as the amount of puke?
3049060	3050060	He goes, wait, that's the joke.
3050060	3052060	That's the whole joke.
3052060	3053060	He said, put $20.
3053060	3056060	And then she's like, why is there $40?
3056060	3057060	Because they pooped my pants.
3057060	3060060	Because the guy pooped in my pants.
3061060	3064060	That's the joke.
3064060	3067060	Thanks, kids.
3067060	3070060	I actually don't understand why.
3070060	3074060	I understand that it's not funny when I say it, but I don't understand what I'm doing wrong.
3074060	3080060	The guy pooped in his pants and then he's saying to his wife, I have twice as much money because I pooped my pants.
3080060	3082060	Here's my feeling.
3082060	3085060	Here's why I think that you're not great at telling joke jokes.
3086060	3089060	I don't know if you can connect why you're a good writer and you're good at writing.
3089060	3090060	Thank you.
3090060	3093060	But you can write good stories.
3093060	3095060	More booze, God damn it.
3095060	3099060	You do want to come up here and tell the joke.
3103060	3104060	Sorry, Dan.
3104060	3107060	I was interrupted by people giving me alcohol.
3107060	3109060	Fucking cheers.
3113060	3114060	That was good.
3114060	3117060	I think that you're bad at telling jokes, Dan.
3117060	3125060	You get caught up not just in joke telling, but I think in your interpersonal relationships and stuff, you get hung up on details.
3125060	3126060	Oh, yeah.
3126060	3128060	I have a good story about that.
3128060	3135060	That get in the way of the simplicity of a thing.
3135060	3139060	A proper joke should be, guy says this, other guy says that, punchline.
3140060	3142060	Here's the thing about jokes.
3142060	3150060	I always laugh at them when people tell them, but the thing is, when you look back on the joke, everything has been about dishonesty.
3150060	3153060	Because it's all about this pattern.
3153060	3156060	But you laughed at my joke when I told you this joke today at the bar.
3156060	3158060	You laughed so hard you almost hit your head on the bar.
3158060	3164060	I'll give you a nickel if you give me a dollar, and then the guy starts sucking his dick and goes, what are you doing?
3164060	3166060	I told you I'd give you a nickel if you give me a dollar.
3167060	3179060	There's some turn of phrase that you're like, oh, if everybody doesn't say exactly the right thing, then the joke's not funny.
3179060	3184060	And that's bad craftsmanship, because that's called Three's Company.
3184060	3192060	When Mr. Roper's fixing the toilet and he thinks he hears Chrissy, she's talking about a wart that she has.
3192060	3193060	It's from 1979, everybody.
3193060	3195060	There was a show called Three's Company.
3195060	3200060	And Mr. Roper's plunging the toilet, and he can hear Chrissy and Jack Tripper.
3200060	3202060	He never plunged the toilet.
3202060	3205060	He's dead now.
3205060	3208060	John Ritter, National Treasurer, and he's dead now.
3208060	3211060	So, yeah.
3211060	3212060	Yeah.
3212060	3215060	Yeah, you feel as bad as you should.
3215060	3218060	And he hears her going, what?
3218060	3220060	It's so big.
3220060	3223060	And he thinks she's talking about a baby in her stomach.
3223060	3224060	And he goes, it's so big.
3224060	3226060	No, like his dick.
3226060	3229060	Well, every episode of Three's Company was like that.
3229060	3231060	It was like somebody hearing something.
3231060	3232060	It's so big.
3232060	3233060	It won't fit.
3233060	3237060	And they're like pushing a box into a thing.
3237060	3238060	It's so big.
3238060	3240060	I keep pushing it harder.
3240060	3246060	And then someone's in the outside of the room going, oh, it's so big.
3246060	3249060	I can't put some lube on it.
3250060	3253060	And that would be the whole episode.
3253060	3254060	And that's bad writing.
3254060	3255060	That's bad writing.
3255060	3259060	Because if you're Spanish and you're watching that, you're like, what is going on?
3259060	3260060	Yeah, but Dan...
3260060	3263060	Why doesn't that guy just go into the room?
3263060	3267060	Just go in the room and confront them about their sexuality.
3267060	3272060	If you're so concerned with it, stop looking at the camera.
3272060	3273060	I don't understand, Dan.
3273060	3277060	Well, go down there and do something about what you're excited about.
3277060	3279060	Go talk to them.
3279060	3282060	Like, Mr. Roper thought they were having an abortion.
3282060	3287060	Like, in the episode where he's fixing the sink.
3287060	3289060	And that's literally what he...
3289060	3290060	That's the truth.
3290060	3294060	The joke of the episode is that Mr. Roper thought that Chrissy was going to have an abortion.
3294060	3296060	Because she's going, oh, it's so big.
3296060	3297060	It's in my stomach.
3297060	3298060	And I can't...
3298060	3299060	Or whatever.
3299060	3300060	And she was talking about a wart.
3300060	3304060	And Jack Tripper's going, well, I heard a doctor said if you rub a lemon on it.
3304060	3306060	And Mr. Roper's like...
3307060	3309060	But he thinks there's human life at stake.
3309060	3311060	And he doesn't intervene.
3311060	3312060	And that's bad writing.
3312060	3315060	Because there's California law that says he's not allowed to enter their apartment.
3315060	3319060	Well, he shouldn't be listening to them through their sink.
3319060	3321060	How does that apply to this joke?
3321060	3325060	Because if your comedy is based on word...
3325060	3327060	On misunderstanding words.
3327060	3329060	Like, it's not good comedy.
3329060	3330060	The reason why...
3330060	3332060	It's like, oh, I thought you said fudge.
3332060	3333060	You said pudge.
3333060	3335060	That's not funny.
3335060	3337060	But that's not this joke either.
3337060	3338060	It is.
3338060	3339060	Because the guy's like...
3339060	3341060	I slipped at a pussy.
3341060	3342060	No, I thought you said pussy.
3342060	3344060	You loved this joke.
3344060	3345060	I liked it.
3345060	3346060	But now I'm mad at it.
3346060	3351060	You laughed at the proper telling of a simple three-act play of a joke.
3351060	3352060	I'm just saying.
3352060	3355060	You're mad because you're finally not good at something.
3355060	3356060	Yeah, well, so what?
3356060	3358060	I'm not good at a dumb thing.
3358060	3359060	It's dumb.
3359060	3361060	But you want to be able to tell a joke.
3361060	3362060	A guy goes...
3362060	3364060	A lobster goes into a bar.
3364060	3365060	No, this is...
3365060	3366060	A lobster goes, shut up.
3366060	3368060	I'm going to tell it.
3368060	3370060	A lobster goes into a bar.
3370060	3372060	And he goes, like, can I...
3372060	3375060	And before he even finishes talking,
3375060	3377060	the bartender goes, get the fuck out of here.
3377060	3378060	Get out of here.
3378060	3379060	Get out of here.
3379060	3381060	And the lobster goes, no.
3381060	3382060	He's bummed out and he leaves.
3382060	3384060	And then there's another guy at the bar
3384060	3386060	who was there before the lobster came in.
3386060	3387060	And he saw the whole thing.
3387060	3389060	And he goes, like, what the fuck was that about?
3389060	3390060	And the bartender goes...
3390060	3392060	He goes, what was that?
3392060	3393060	What's the...
3393060	3394060	What's the...
3394060	3397060	What's the history between you and the...
3397060	3399060	And the bartender goes, that guy,
3399060	3403060	he always comes in here and it's always like this.
3403060	3406060	And then for you listening,
3406060	3409060	he's making a claw thing.
3409060	3410060	That was close.
3410060	3411060	He's making a claw.
3411060	3412060	That was close.
3412060	3414060	That was an improvement on your version today.
3414060	3415060	I'm so irritable right now.
3415060	3416060	I feel...
3416060	3417060	I feel...
3417060	3418060	You know when...
3418060	3419060	It's okay to be bad at something.
3419060	3421060	You have to be good at everything.
3421060	3425060	Your attention to detail really accentuated itself
3425060	3429060	when we went on the Halloween haunt ride.
3429060	3430060	Hayride.
3430060	3432060	In Griffith Park.
3432060	3433060	Yeah.
3433060	3436060	And, you know, it was just a hayride
3436060	3438060	and you just...
3438060	3441060	It takes you through different spooky moments.
3441060	3442060	But Dan...
3442060	3443060	Okay, that's...
3443060	3445060	Dan is like breaking it down.
3445060	3447060	It takes you through different spooky moments.
3447060	3450060	He's going through the story circle of this goddamn ride.
3451060	3453060	He's like, so why is that...
3453060	3455060	Is that a set up to that?
3455060	3457060	I'm like, no, it's just spookiness.
3457060	3459060	But you had to break it down.
3459060	3461060	No, but nothing was spooking in.
3461060	3462060	Nothing was.
3462060	3463060	I'm not dumb.
3463060	3469060	I understood that the hayride was taking you through different spooky scenes.
3469060	3473060	I was thrown by the tonal incompatibility.
3473060	3474060	This is not...
3474060	3476060	I'm not like a logic guy.
3476060	3480060	I'm saying I was thrown by the tonal asymmetry
3480060	3483060	of in the middle of the haunted hayride,
3483060	3488060	which was festooned with non-verbal goblins
3488060	3490060	and gimlets and goobahs.
3490060	3492060	It was festooned with non-verbal goblins.
3492060	3494060	It was festooned with non-verbal goblins.
3494060	3496060	Everyone's going...
3496060	3498060	And then one guy in the middle of it,
3498060	3501060	in what was the most expensive scene,
3501060	3504060	because there was like a Cadillac and there was a 60s song,
3504060	3506060	there was a needle drop playing,
3506060	3508060	like the Supremes were playing,
3508060	3510060	and everyone was speaking English,
3510060	3512060	and it was a period piece.
3512060	3514060	That's weird, because everyone, before and after,
3514060	3516060	it was like, I'm Jack Skellingboober.
3516060	3518060	But they didn't say that.
3518060	3519060	They weren't speaking English.
3519060	3521060	They were going goo, goo, goo, goo, goo.
3521060	3524060	And then there was one guy going like, oh, hey.
3524060	3526060	Oh, hey.
3526060	3529060	You didn't see anything, did you?
3529060	3532060	And everyone was like so uncomfortable.
3532060	3534060	Because he was like talking to people.
3534060	3536060	It was also after he shot somebody in the back of the head,
3536060	3538060	in the back of his car.
3538060	3540060	Yeah, it was fucking weird.
3540060	3542060	I think that's what made everyone uncomfortable.
3542060	3544060	Not the story logic.
3544060	3546060	Well, because obviously also,
3546060	3549060	society's consciousness has shifted,
3549060	3552060	and you'd be dumb to...
3552060	3554060	It's okay to be frustrated by that,
3554060	3556060	but you'd be a fool to not understand that.
3556060	3558060	I was in the cab, and I clicked on one of those ads,
3559060	3562060	because as a story about the Bloomingdale's,
3562060	3564060	did you guys see the Bloomingdale's ad thing?
3564060	3566060	Did you guys know? Because it's in the cab.
3566060	3568060	This is my favorite joke.
3568060	3571060	It's the Bloomingdale's holiday catalog.
3571060	3574060	It's obviously just like a fucking clusterfuck
3574060	3577060	of corporate kind of sales teams.
3577060	3579060	Is this the one you were jerking off to earlier?
3579060	3581060	They take a bunch of pictures of what?
3581060	3583060	Is this the thing you were jerking off to earlier?
3583060	3584060	Jeff.
3584060	3586060	Come on, Jeff.
3587060	3589060	I will tell you guys, I swear to God, tomorrow night,
3589060	3591060	I will tell you I'm going to Google her tonight
3591060	3593060	and make sure she's 18,
3593060	3595060	and then I'll tell you her name.
3595060	3597060	It's not AT&T.
3597060	3601060	I know that girl, and I'm offended on her behalf.
3601060	3603060	That is a friend of mine.
3603060	3607060	That lady is a human being.
3609060	3612060	The possibly underage girl I'm talking about
3612060	3614060	is from a completely different commercial.
3615060	3617060	God damn it.
3617060	3619060	Why did you strap me with that?
3619060	3621060	I'm sorry.
3621060	3623060	Oh, the Bloomingdale's.
3623060	3626060	He's kind of a guy, a Robin Thicke-looking guy.
3626060	3628060	They photograph people at different times,
3628060	3631060	and they're all against a white backdrop.
3631060	3634060	Someone's job is to put copy
3634060	3637060	on every page of the Bloomingdale's catalog.
3637060	3641060	There's a lady in a champagne glass
3641060	3643060	with new pumps going like,
3643060	3648060	and it says cheers to feeling alive.
3648060	3650060	Somebody's job is to just go,
3650060	3653060	just diarrhea words onto a page.
3653060	3655060	Someone else has taken a picture,
3655060	3657060	and there's no communication between these departments.
3657060	3659060	Nobody's trying to send a signal.
3659060	3661060	But there's a page in the Bloomingdale's catalog,
3661060	3665060	so it's like a woman going,
3665060	3668060	and she's excited to be looking at something
3668060	3672060	other than the guy next to her,
3672060	3675060	and then three feet from her
3675060	3678060	is this Robin Thicke-stubble guy.
3678060	3684060	They're both in casual business holiday party wear,
3684060	3687060	and the guy's glaring at her,
3687060	3692060	and the guy that wrote the copy or lady,
3692060	3696060	equal, I'll bet you any money,
3696060	3700060	50% chance this dumbass was a woman.
3700060	3703060	Whoever wrote the copy wrote,
3703060	3707060	it's just this copy that's stylized, offset, sexy copy.
3707060	3710060	It's like the picture, but the problem is,
3710060	3713060	it's a woman going, ehh, and there's a guy going, ehh,
3713060	3715060	and the copy says,
3715060	3719060	spike your best friend's eggnog when she's not looking.
3719060	3725060	And everybody's like, uh, what in the rape?
3725060	3728060	Are you selling me?
3728060	3733060	Why am I supposed to buy pants now?
3733060	3737060	And there's no heroes or villains of the story,
3737060	3739060	it's just kind of interesting.
3739060	3741060	It sounds like there's at least one villain in this.
3741060	3746060	Well, no, I definitely guarantee you that nobody thought,
3746060	3750060	this is hilarious because someone's going to have nonconsensual sex.
3750060	3754060	I bet you a million dollars, nobody ever thought that.
3754060	3758060	I'm sure someone was like, I bet that person,
3758060	3760060	I'll bet you another million dollars on top of that,
3760060	3763060	that the person wasn't looking at the photos,
3763060	3765060	wasn't looking at those photos.
3765060	3767060	The person whose job it is to write a bunch of copy,
3767060	3770060	they were just writing garbage,
3770060	3774060	that they were told to write 50 things
3774060	3779060	that are like naughty, sexy, holiday things.
3779060	3784060	But hang your stockings where you're, where you're, where you're,
3784060	3787060	sex, pussy.
3787060	3789060	Hang your stockings where you're sex, pussy.
3789060	3792060	I don't work in advertising, I assume it's not that easy.
3792060	3794060	Just spitballing, spitballing.
3794060	3796060	But yeah, spike your best friend's egg.
3796060	3800060	The truth is, it was actually just a visual.
3800060	3802060	Anyways, the reason I brought it up is, when did I bring it up?
3802060	3805060	Because, well, because it's like, because we are living in a world
3805060	3807060	where it's like, and I think this is a good thing,
3807060	3809060	where everybody's like hyper-focused on this stuff,
3809060	3812060	and it's like, yeah, what is my point?
3812060	3814060	I don't know what my point is.
3814060	3817060	Can we tell a couple of IO stories?
3817060	3819060	Well, I already, I, I, I, I, I, I did.
3819060	3820060	You did, right?
3820060	3822060	I told the, yeah, the Good Riddance.
3822060	3823060	Oh, the Good Riddance, yeah, yeah.
3823060	3826060	Do you want to tell this one, or is that too personal?
3826060	3828060	Well, what are you going to tell?
3828060	3831060	Well, you kind of have to...
3831060	3835060	Well, what is it? What do you...
3835060	3836060	Well, go ahead, yeah, go ahead.
3836060	3838060	We got, we got to do pre-interviews more.
3838060	3840060	Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.
3840060	3841060	There's better be about Chevy Chase.
3841060	3843060	Yeah, go ahead.
3843060	3844060	He's showing a picture.
3844060	3845060	Go ahead.
3845060	3846060	What is that?
3846060	3847060	What's the story is that I sent you that picture?
3847060	3850060	Well, yeah, you sent me this picture, and I showed it to IO,
3850060	3853060	and I said, here's Dan's new girlfriend.
3853060	3857060	And she looked, and she's like, wow, that, she is really hot.
3857060	3858060	Wow.
3858060	3862060	She looks a little, looks a little fake, though.
3862060	3864060	It's a mannequin.
3866060	3867060	I don't know if you guys...
3867060	3868060	Wait.
3868060	3869060	Get a shot of this.
3869060	3871060	Who tricked the photo?
3871060	3874060	It is the hottest girl I've ever seen in my life, by the way.
3874060	3876060	Well, I figured, you showed me that photo,
3876060	3879060	and Dan goes, you see the girl that Dan's banging right now,
3879060	3880060	and it's a mannequin.
3880060	3881060	Here, pass it around.
3881060	3882060	Come on.
3882060	3888060	It's a national mannequin.
3888060	3890060	Come on.
3890060	3892060	Well, obviously, it's a mannequin.
3892060	3895060	I think she's hot, man.
3895060	3898060	Yeah, well, there's no ugly mannequins.
3900060	3903060	You never go through a target and go, ew.
3903060	3906060	Don't scroll past any of them.
3906060	3907060	Oh, no.
3907060	3908060	It's your funeral.
3908060	3909060	It's your fucking funeral.
3909060	3911060	Yeah, you're all fucking left all the way.
3911060	3912060	No, no, no.
3912060	3914060	Because you're going to see a lot of dick pics.
3914060	3916060	Lots of Dino dick pics.
3916060	3918060	I tell you, that's right.
3918060	3919060	Dino...
3919060	3920060	Really fucking do it.
3920060	3922060	Give me my fucking phone back.
3924060	3926060	Oh, you can't pick...
3928060	3929060	Oh, dear.
3929060	3930060	Wow.
3930060	3931060	Okay.
3931060	3933060	I thought you were...
3933060	3934060	You're okay.
3936060	3939060	Dino, what was the...
3940060	3942060	You were telling me...
3942060	3946060	You were like, oh, I got to delete some of my pictures
3946060	3953060	because I have so many sex movies or some phrase like that.
3953060	3954060	And I was like, really?
3954060	3955060	Sounds like me.
3955060	3958060	I said, you have sex movies on your phone?
3958060	3960060	And he's like, yeah, yeah.
3960060	3961060	Don't you?
3961060	3963060	No, I don't.
3964060	3967060	And he's like, well, I do.
3967060	3968060	I have a lot of them.
3968060	3969060	I have a lot of them.
3969060	3973060	And I was like, there's so many that they fill up your whole phone.
3973060	3974060	I was like, yeah.
3974060	3976060	And I'm like, oh.
3976060	3980060	And I can't remember if I was like, did I say, can I see one?
3980060	3981060	I think so, yeah.
3981060	3986060	And looking back on it, I got what I deserved because I was like,
3986060	3989060	well, can I see one?
3989060	3990060	And you're like, yeah.
3990060	3991060	It's your funeral.
3991060	3993060	I think sex movies, Dino is in or...
3993060	3994060	That's the punch line.
3994060	3995060	That's the punch line.
3995060	3996060	And he hands it.
3996060	3997060	And he goes, like, really?
3997060	3998060	You want to see one?
3998060	3999060	And I'm like, well, yeah.
3999060	4000060	Why not?
4000060	4003060	It's good enough for you to be on your phone.
4003060	4007060	Yeah, I guess I would like to see it.
4007060	4009060	And he's like, okay.
4009060	4011060	And he hands me the phone.
4011060	4015060	And it's a woman that I know.
4015060	4020060	Because it's someone that slept with Dino.
4020060	4023060	And it's like, it's a movie.
4023060	4025060	It's her having sex.
4025060	4026060	I'm like, wow.
4026060	4029060	That's Rebecca from marketing.
4029060	4032060	Yeah, it's a sex movie.
4032060	4037060	I thought it would be a French thing with like Amelie or something.
4037060	4041060	I thought it was like a porno on your phone.
4041060	4042060	That's why I was asking.
4042060	4044060	It's because I was going like, what do you watch it?
4044060	4047060	To be fair, I did submit it to Ken, but...
4047060	4053060	I love that you thought that I was asking to see.
4053060	4056060	A movie of you making love.
4056060	4058060	I really thought our friendship reached a level.
4058060	4059060	Whoa.
4059060	4061060	Okay, we're going to share.
4061060	4063060	Also, you're not in the movie.
4063060	4064060	It's just her.
4064060	4066060	It was directed by Michelle Gondry.
4066060	4068060	It was a good movie.
4068060	4073060	It was gorgeous.
4073060	4076060	Dino, can we talk about your upcoming rendezvous?
4076060	4078060	Is it on Sunday?
4078060	4080060	Yeah, I don't care.
4080060	4082060	Whatever.
4082060	4088060	Dino has an ability to do things that I think we should all aspire to.
4088060	4090060	I think we are...
4090060	4092060	I don't think that's that great of a story.
4092060	4094060	I don't know the story.
4094060	4095060	Not yet, anyway.
4095060	4097060	Yeah, this is act one.
4097060	4099060	This is fade in on the story.
4099060	4105060	Dino has a threesome lined up, and he showed me photos of one of the girls.
4105060	4107060	Fucking wow.
4107060	4114060	And she's a nightmare.
4114060	4119060	And you said that the one that's a nightmare is going to be submissive to the other girl...
4119060	4121060	That's what I'm hoping for.
4121060	4124060	Who hates her.
4124060	4128060	And you said that girl you hate is going to beat you.
4128060	4132060	Yeah, it's very intricate.
4132060	4134060	I'm not sure how it's going to work out.
4134060	4139060	Yeah, it's a math problem.
4139060	4142060	But these girls aren't pals. They're not friends.
4142060	4144060	Are they acquaintances?
4144060	4146060	Yeah, they're acquaintances. That's how they hate each other.
4146060	4147060	Okay.
4147060	4158060	Can we talk about the fact that there was a point where you were seeing a sex worker...
4158060	4160060	It's okay, man. It's okay.
4160060	4170060	What is happening? You okay?
4170060	4175060	The sex worker was emailing Dino and saying...
4175060	4177060	Oh, wait. No, let me tell this story.
4177060	4178060	Can you tell it?
4178060	4180060	Yeah, I think so.
4180060	4182060	Dan, you tell it. You're good at this.
4182060	4184060	This is crazy.
4184060	4187060	I'm not a good storyteller, but I think he's nervous.
4187060	4191060	I'm a very gifted storyteller.
4191060	4195060	I want to get the story right.
4195060	4198060	The way I remember the story is, shut up.
4198060	4200060	No, go ahead.
4200060	4202060	This is about redemption.
4202060	4206060	Dino had a relationship with a sex person.
4206060	4209060	I was dating this girl who was very submissive to me.
4209060	4211060	Let me tell the story.
4211060	4214060	She was very submissive to me.
4214060	4221060	And then I remembered this dominatrix who wanted to have a baby with me.
4221060	4223060	And I'm like, been there, done that.
4223060	4227060	It's the ultimate domination.
4227060	4231060	35 years of college tuition.
4231060	4234060	Oh, believe me.
4234060	4237060	So this dominatrix cut me off.
4237060	4239060	She's like, I don't want to see you anymore.
4239060	4242060	She got emotionally involved with me.
4242060	4245060	And so I started dating this other girl.
4245060	4248060	And I said, hey, would you like to go see a dominatrix with me?
4248060	4249060	And she said, yes.
4249060	4258060	And I said, can I start an email account and put your picture on it and pretend I'm you?
4258060	4261060	To lower the dominatrix, I didn't want to see you anymore.
4261060	4262060	Right.
4262060	4265060	But wait, I'm not the worst guy in the world.
4265060	4267060	You'll see.
4268060	4271060	There's that worst person in this story.
4271060	4274060	She gets worse and everybody gets worse, too.
4274060	4277060	So I'll pretend I'm you.
4277060	4284060	And you're going to say to her, you want to have a threesome with her and this other guy.
4284060	4288060	And you're going to describe someone who looks very much like me.
4288060	4290060	And you say, can you get this guy?
4290060	4296060	Like some guy, like the dominatrix, you know, it's not any set person.
4296060	4300060	It's like she's just describing a guy that she would like in her fantasies.
4300060	4304060	And so I started emailing the dominatrix because the girl said, OK.
4304060	4309060	And I said and I said to ask her, yeah, I'm looking, you know, to date this guy, you know,
4309060	4322060	like a tall kind of greasy, you know, kind of Italian, Turkish, you know, dancing around the Greek thing.
4322060	4325060	Right around Greece.
4325060	4326060	Not Macedonian.
4326060	4328060	I'm not Moroccan.
4328060	4331060	Do you know anybody like that?
4331060	4335060	If you hit Malta, you went too far south.
4335060	4341060	Just something that generally feels swarthy with a lot of ruins.
4341060	4344060	I'd like his columns to be Ionic.
4352060	4353060	That's not.
4353060	4354060	No, I disapprove.
4354060	4355060	I disapprove.
4355060	4356060	I disapprove.
4356060	4357060	I thought it was worth a chuckle.
4357060	4358060	Not a plaza.
4358060	4359060	Not a bow.
4359060	4360060	Wait.
4360060	4361060	Now he's leaving.
4361060	4362060	OK.
4362060	4363060	So there's a gunshot.
4363060	4365060	There's a single gunshot.
4365060	4368060	And we spent the rest of our lives.
4368060	4369060	What?
4369060	4370060	What?
4370060	4372060	I thought.
4372060	4380060	So I described myself what I think is to a T and she says she writes me back.
4380060	4381060	But really the girl.
4381060	4382060	She's thinking the girl.
4383060	4385060	So I just want to just clarify, please.
4385060	4386060	A monster goes into a bar.
4386060	4387060	This is.
4387060	4391060	This ain't you've got male kids.
4391060	4400060	He's typing to his former dominatrix who wants nothing to be a young lady with money saying,
4400060	4403060	I want to fuck an ugly guy.
4403060	4405060	Do you know any.
4405060	4406060	And he's.
4406060	4407060	I didn't.
4407060	4408060	I didn't say I believe her.
4408060	4411060	And the reason why he can't deal with her in person is because she wanted to have a baby.
4411060	4412060	And you did not.
4412060	4413060	So.
4413060	4414060	Right.
4414060	4415060	OK.
4415060	4417060	But I thought maybe, you know, because she knew like I'm into experimenting and being
4417060	4418060	into threesomes.
4418060	4419060	Right.
4419060	4421060	So she wrote me back or wrote her back immediately.
4421060	4422060	Her back.
4422060	4425060	And said, got the perfect guy for you.
4425060	4426060	Sends a picture.
4426060	4432060	Just this opposite of like just no hair.
4432060	4437060	You know, really skinny bald guy.
4437060	4438060	I'm not.
4438060	4440060	I'm not saying that's gross.
4441060	4444060	I know you're you're you're making a comment that I'm gross.
4444060	4446060	That guy's from Queens.
4446060	4448060	I learned from him probably.
4448060	4451060	But I say a specific area and everyone laughs.
4451060	4454060	That guy's from Queens.
4454060	4458060	Sounds like someone's from Manhattan Island.
4458060	4461060	Actually, actually, I I'm telling it in reverse.
4461060	4463060	That was the second picture she sent me.
4463060	4466060	The first picture was like a really good looking guy really fit.
4466060	4467060	And I had to write back.
4467060	4469060	No, he's way too good looking.
4469060	4472060	I want to I want to scummy her.
4472060	4474060	No, I know Swarthi was it.
4474060	4476060	I use Swarthi the first time around.
4476060	4478060	Now it's got to be like Sleezy.
4478060	4479060	Sleezy.
4479060	4483060	Just a gross kind of out of shape guy.
4483060	4486060	And then she sends me the other skinny bald guy.
4486060	4488060	And I'm like too short.
4488060	4489060	Like more hair.
4489060	4492060	But like like just an uglier guy.
4492060	4498060	Like I got a shit all over myself now in order to try and pinpoint me.
4498060	4500060	Just so the fun can be good.
4500060	4502060	Yeah, so I can start having fun.
4502060	4507060	I want his last name to have five syllables.
4507060	4509060	So the third thing.
4509060	4516060	I want him to sound like an invisible creature from Sesame Street.
4516060	4522060	I want I want I want I want him to sound like someone only Big Bird could see.
4522060	4526060	Stemallofagus.
4526060	4533060	So the third picture is me from community.
4533060	4537060	And I'm like this guy is perfect.
4537060	4543060	And I'm trying to like go at lol and you know just trying not to talk like me like rough.
4543060	4546060	You know this guy's great.
4546060	4551060	Doing your best impression of an unhealthy of an idiot.
4551060	4552060	Mustering.
4552060	4553060	Yeah.
4553060	4555060	If I could get into the head of a crazy person that would be amazing.
4555060	4559060	Are you kidding the girl whose account you put you're pretending to be.
4559060	4560060	Are she aware of all this?
4560060	4561060	She's in Italy at this point.
4561060	4562060	She said do whatever you want.
4562060	4563060	Okay.
4563060	4564060	Yeah.
4564060	4565060	That's her turn on.
4565060	4566060	Yeah.
4566060	4567060	There's a couple of people out there.
4567060	4568060	They get turned on by identity.
4568060	4569060	Yeah.
4569060	4584060	Actually they go to ATMs and they they with a they they they they do their ATM transactions sideways.
4584060	4589060	They neatly folder ATM can they.
4589060	4592060	So I say perfect perfect perfect perfect.
4592060	4593060	This guy's perfect.
4593060	4594060	He's the one.
4594060	4596060	Hire him.
4596060	4609060	So so then I get an email Dino gets an email from the dominatrix saying get a load of this.
4609060	4610060	Literally.
4610060	4615060	This girl wants to have a fucking thing with someone like you.
4615060	4624060	You were the first person I thought of the tip off to the ripoff.
4624060	4626060	That's really the best ending.
4626060	4629060	You know then we we ended up you know there were a couple of low count.
4629060	4630060	Oh well I had to.
4630060	4632060	What was the first encounter.
4632060	4633060	How did that for.
4633060	4636060	Well there's more because I had to.
4636060	4644060	She's and she's she's she wrote back to the girl me and said I'm going to need some money up front.
4644060	4648060	And I said oh you know I my car just got towed and everything.
4648060	4649060	I did my credit cards.
4649060	4651060	Can I just send you cash.
4651060	4652060	And she said sure.
4652060	4656060	And then she wrote Dino me back and said this person is asking for cash.
4656060	4660060	I think it's a guy.
4660060	4662060	This guy this guy doesn't want to give.
4662060	4665060	I don't think he's going to send me cash.
4665060	4667060	You know I've got an instinct for this kind of.
4667060	4669060	Yeah.
4669060	4676060	So I you know I'm actually a community and Ken Jeong walks by and I'm trying.
4676060	4682060	I'm trying to write the end on the envelope and like really female writing.
4682060	4687060	And I'm like Ken does that look like a woman wrote it and he's like what I don't know.
4687060	4689060	Yeah I guess so.
4689060	4690060	Why.
4690060	4692060	And I tell him the whole story and he's like all right.
4692060	4693060	All right.
4693060	4694060	You're fucked up man.
4694060	4701060	The idea that this would just sound like a lady writing.
4701060	4702060	Why.
4702060	4703060	And you.
4703060	4704060	I told the whole thing.
4704060	4707060	Did you have a white beard when you finished.
4707060	4709060	That's a long story.
4709060	4710060	Yeah.
4710060	4714060	Well like I said I don't know.
4714060	4716060	Yeah.
4716060	4721060	So anyway so I send the letter off and a couple of days later she writes Dino back.
4721060	4731060	The dominatrix and says good news got got the money handwriting looks feminine.
4731060	4733060	Swear to God.
4733060	4734060	Yeah.
4734060	4736060	Speaking of gender roles.
4736060	4737060	Good segue.
4737060	4738060	Yeah.
4738060	4739060	Is Jean here.
4739060	4740060	Is our old friend Jane.
4740060	4741060	Who.
4741060	4742060	Jane.
4742060	4743060	Jane are you here.
4743060	4744060	Do you want to come up.
4744060	4745060	Do you have a cold feet.
4745060	4746060	You want to come up.
4746060	4747060	We haven't visited.
4748060	4749060	She's in New York and.
4754060	4759060	This is Jane that brings the earth shine and there's a glass blowing scientist.
4767060	4768060	Hello.
4768060	4769060	That's it.
4775060	4776060	So I haven't talked to you.
4776060	4781060	I'm excited to talk to you because it will look like I'm going to take you through what I understand.
4781060	4784060	And maybe I'm going to be way off base because I'm an idiot.
4784060	4797060	But like there was a period of time there where I was like well you know originally I was like oh you're our friend and you're in your trance and you like you talk to us and like by the way I got to get sidetracked by this but you deserve a purple heart for me.
4798060	4811060	For all of the role that you've played like being a good kind person and all of my fracas and ups and downs with like like like like like just this a like the most important thing in the world.
4812060	4826060	Just being a good kind smart person and being forgiving and all that stuff is like enabled like I think listeners of this show especially me to like work through the fucking confusing morass that we've been living through the last eight years of culture.
4827060	4835060	Not to be insensitive but I can't believe your first question wasn't did you find my story a turn on or what.
4837060	4838060	219 do you know.
4842060	4843060	Nice callback.
4844060	4861060	But anyways so so Jane not just being a person who exists in a glass cabinet that's our transgender friend that could come out and talk about transgender stuff actually has her own life where you're like some kind of like James Bond of glassblowing where.
4862060	4869060	Like like you you developed new ways to blow glass and stuff and we're a local hero in your own industry and community right.
4870060	4871060	Yeah OK OK.
4872060	4873060	We could go there if we want to.
4874060	4885060	But there was a there was a there was so there was a point was like you had been on the show a couple of times we talked frankly and probably ignorantly on my part about about about like this emerging sensitively and with great questions.
4886060	4887060	I'll get it.
4888060	4890060	Using the wrong pronouns and then there's me.
4891060	4892060	But we've never talked before.
4892060	4893060	I know.
4893060	4894060	But then there was.
4895060	4896060	Where you were succeeding.
4897060	4900060	As a professional as a scientist you were succeeding.
4901060	4914060	I remember just something about what you were tweeting and what you were saying made me think that there was something happening that was like a challenge in you balancing your professional life with what you were your transition.
4914060	4920060	Yes I mean it's sort of it's a very common thing that has to happen because a transition doesn't it's a transition.
4921060	4922060	It's a time thing.
4923060	4943060	And when you're in between I'm in between you have to make some choices about where are you going to be who you are and where are you going to be who you were because every single tax form bathroom sign like everything is based on.
4944060	4960060	You exist within a culture and that culture makes certain demands on what we talked about in Toronto last year about society is a system and systems are all about reducing energy and about energy expenditure and you're in order to shots fired.
4961060	4963060	You heard it system system.
4964060	4965060	I hate systems.
4966060	4968060	You're about reducing energy you piece of shit.
4968060	4969060	What's up.
4969060	4970060	Jane is system.
4971060	4972060	System is not here.
4972060	4974060	System doesn't listen to this fucking show.
4975060	4977060	People listen to this fucking show.
4977060	4978060	Yes.
4979060	4985060	Systems run in fear of this show and Hispanic people.
4985060	4986060	I don't know why.
4986060	4988060	That's not my choice.
4989060	4996060	The idea of the idea of harm in town and I mean some of the original conceit about is it going to be 100 people is going to be 300 people.
4997060	4999060	Are they all going to be up at moon moon or VIP moon.
4999060	5001060	You know you're going to have enough people for you to go to the taco cart.
5001060	5003060	You mean that premise that we ditched three episodes in.
5004060	5006060	But that we all hold to very dearly.
5007060	5009060	I'm going back to it because I hate everybody.
5010060	5021060	Something that we've created that people that are harm in town fans so like I think we all agree on the idea that we all connect on the possibility of something better whatever that might be.
5022060	5024060	And I think a lot of it is that it's system free.
5025060	5027060	I mean it's the idea that you get to.
5027060	5027060	
5027060	5028060	Don't be a dick.
5028060	5038060	Give more than you take that you that there's a point where if you get if you get the number of people down small enough you can exist without a system you can have a communal type of governance going on.
5039060	5048060	But you get to a certain size in order for you get to a certain point where you have to start dealing with the lowest common denominators who are going to drag things down.
5048060	5054060	You have to have rules to accommodate for people who aren't going to who aren't going to fit and who are going to be dicks.
5055060	5057060	And that's where laws come in.
5057060	5060060	Laws are about the are about reducing.
5060060	5067060	Not because any individual is that dumb but because in mass we are we effectively become that dumb.
5067060	5070060	Yeah statistics start to take over and people are allowed to drop down.
5071060	5081060	Jane where do you like aside from the fact that you do nothing but interesting stuff and make fantastic booze that you give me and that she makes a fucking earth shine that will wipe you out.
5081060	5083060	So I've had some you guys see this stuff back there.
5083060	5084060	There's stuff back there.
5084060	5085060	There's stuff backstage.
5085060	5086060	Oh my lord.
5086060	5087060	You guys didn't know.
5089060	5090060	Let's bring it out.
5091060	5094060	Wow. I mean I think that the feds are going to be honest.
5094060	5095060	Just a minute.
5095060	5096060	There it is.
5096060	5097060	Oh this stuff.
5099060	5101060	So this is this is something new.
5101060	5102060	This is something new.
5102060	5104060	And shout out to Dustin who's hoarding it.
5105060	5106060	Shout out to Jenna.
5106060	5107060	This is it.
5107060	5108060	Falconers blend.
5109060	5110060	Who's our new Falconer.
5110060	5111060	OK.
5112060	5113060	On Twitter some gal said.
5114060	5114060	
5114060	5117060	So Jenna is now the official Falconer of Harmon town.
5119060	5123060	So if I hold my wrist up with a Falcon land on my arm right now it's a hawk.
5123060	5126060	She's got a hawk and the hawk's name is Anna Kendrick which is awesome.
5127060	5131060	So Jenna is a homesteader up in the Adirondacks.
5131060	5135060	She lives alone and is trying to make it as a as a farmer.
5135060	5137060	She's got she's got sheep.
5137060	5138060	She's got pigs.
5138060	5139060	She's got a hawk.
5139060	5140060	She goes that she goes.
5140060	5142060	So that's authentic transgender whiskey.
5144060	5145060	Trans asterisk.
5145060	5147060	Everybody before we go any further.
5147060	5148060	We have a hard out at 8 30.
5148060	5149060	That's two minutes away.
5149060	5150060	Oh shit.
5150060	5151060	Fuck.
5152060	5153060	Oh yeah.

5154060	5155060	Fuck you Bill Burr.
5155060	5156060	I can't believe.
5156060	5157060	Shit.
5157060	5159060	I can't believe I wasted time on that dumb joke.
5159060	5160060	Damn it.
5160060	5161060	All right.
5161060	5162060	Well Jane.
5163060	5165060	I said like like what's going on with you because.
5166060	5167060	Jane what's the goal.
5167060	5173060	My question was like like like if transitional because I you know I'm ignorant it can possibly
5173060	5175060	be if you're going through a transition.
5175060	5179060	What stage do you think you're at and what do you think is at the end of that road.
5179060	5180060	What's your goal.
5180060	5183060	So if 30 years ago.
5183060	5184060	So I'm 51.
5184060	5185060	You and I are the only one.
5185060	5186060	You're fucking.
5186060	5187060	I think we're the oldest people.
5187060	5188060	How are you.
5188060	5189060	51.
5189060	5190060	Shit.
5190060	5191060	The trans don't crack.
5192060	5193060	But.
5194060	5195060	So 30.
5195060	5196060	There's your secret.
5196060	5197060	30 years ago.
5197060	5199060	The goal was totally femme.
5199060	5202060	I mean I wanted I wanted to be Madonna 30 years ago.
5202060	5203060	OK.
5203060	5204060	Well who did.
5204060	5205060	Yeah.
5205060	5206060	Who doesn't.
5206060	5207060	I'm still trying.
5207060	5208060	Full socks.
5208060	5209060	But.
5209060	5210060	Boing.
5210060	5211060	But you know.
5211060	5212060	That was the first video I masturbated to.
5212060	5213060	All right.
5213060	5214060	One minute.
5214060	5215060	OK.
5215060	5216060	I'm going to go.

5217060	5218060	Right.
5218060	5219060	I mean your goals change your comfort changes.
5219060	5223060	And I found actually that where I'm sitting about right now.
5223060	5225060	Hello.
5225060	5227060	Is actually really a comfortable spot.
5227060	5232060	I have I have a huge huge number of people that I know that I work with every day at
5232060	5234060	my job who know me as Jane.
5234060	5245060	I have lots of friends online who know me as Jane who I am accepted for who I am with
5245060	5247060	even though I don't have.
5247060	5249060	I haven't had bottom half surgery.
5249060	5251060	I'm not wearing woman's clothes.
5251060	5253060	I think that's bullshit because I'm not.
5254060	5255060	Gramercy feet are so much.
5255060	5256060	I mean we have to leave.
5256060	5257060	We're so sad.
5258060	5262060	Let's all hang out backstage and drink Jane's wonderful moonshine.
