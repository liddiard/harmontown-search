0	18800	Hear ye, hear ye!
18800	20960	I call this Carmen Town to order.
20960	24360	Ladies and gentlemen, how are you doing tonight?
24360	25360	Fantastic.
26000	29920	Welcome to the Nerdist Theater in downtown Hollywood, California.
29920	33360	Thank you, loyal Harminians, for being here at the Nerd Melt Nerdist Theater.
33360	35960	And thank you for listening in podcast land.
35960	40040	Ladies and gentlemen, last week we tabled the issue of child abuse and peeing in your pants.
40040	43000	Tonight's topic, we tend to discuss technology.
43000	48640	Please, put your hands together for the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
48640	49640	Thank you.
49640	50640	Thank you.
50640	51640	You're very kind.
51640	52640	You're good people.
52640	53640	I'm very excited.
53640	64240	I'm in a very good mood tonight.
64240	65240	Why is that?
65240	70240	I'm rating two TV pilots for networks that were kicking my ass on the ratings when I
70240	71840	was at NBC.
71840	72840	It's very satisfying.
72840	87920	For three years, I was told you get higher ratings, and I figured out how.
87920	90040	I know exactly how I'm going to do it.
90040	95840	I'm going to go to the networks that have higher ratings.
95840	105320	I feel good about my decision, and I'm just in a smirky, smug, self-satisfied third act
105320	107360	of a rom-com kind of mood.
107360	114000	I just feel like I'm in the middle of a montage where there's dissolving charts that are going
114000	121360	up, and Casey Kasem's mentioning me, and Sigourney Weaver's seeing my ad on TV and changing her
121360	126000	mind about my wacky ways.
126000	129760	Things are moving up for old man, Ghostbuster.
129760	130960	That's the reference I was making.
130960	132960	You 25-year-old fucks.
132960	134680	Sorry.
134680	135680	That's a trademark of the show.
135680	140000	I get angry at you for being young, but I'm not in a get-off-my-lawn mood.
140000	143240	I'm in a get-on-my-lawn mood.
143240	145680	Get on my lawn, you fuckers.
145680	146680	Let's party down.
146680	147920	We're at a Yani concert.
148880	152000	There was a guy named Yani.
152000	154400	You young fucks.
154400	156600	You are in a get-off-my-lawn mood.
156600	158200	Deep down, you are.
158200	159200	Nah, nah.
159200	161200	I love you, kids.
161200	164840	I love you so much, I'm going to write a pilot for CBS.
164840	165840	That's how much I love you.
165840	168840	That's a weird reaction.
168840	169840	CBS!
169840	170840	CBS!
170840	177120	No, if I were you guys, I see the tweeters that are coming back at me in the comment
177120	182840	sections under the press releases are like, well, that sucks because it's like, oh, he's
182840	183840	selling out.
183840	184840	Yeah, maybe.
184840	185840	I might.
185840	189320	For like six months, I might give that a taste.
189320	195360	I might kick back in a hammock a little bit and get out of Hanna-Barbera remote-controlled
195360	199920	lawnmower and sip out of a coconut.
199920	202440	I was told not to work so hard for three years.
202440	205760	I'm going to put that theory to the test, see what kind of TV that generates.
205760	206760	I don't know.
206760	207760	Do you have any ideas?
207760	208760	No, sir.
208760	209760	No.
209760	210760	No.
210760	214960	My idea is to write mainstream television.
214960	218320	I mean, at some point, though, you're going to have to...
218320	219320	Nope.
219320	220320	Nope.
220320	221320	No.
221320	225080	Because if I said, if my first meeting at one of these places, if I say, I have this
225080	231160	idea that I have these firefighters, and they're kind of an unlikely family, but when you join
231160	234640	the fire department, you're forced to work with other people, maybe you don't like them
234640	235640	so much.
235640	236640	I think you do have an idea.
236640	237640	No.
237640	240400	I'm saying, if I said this, if this was my idea, I don't know.
240400	244240	The first thing they're going to say is, I love it, and the second thing they're going
244240	250240	to say is, could the firefighters be police?
250240	256880	And if I'm really like jazzed about the firefighter idea, then I'm going to go, I don't know, and
256880	260200	they're going to go, hmm, difficult.
260200	264800	But if I don't care, then I'm going to say, yes, they should be police.
264800	268240	You're brilliant.
268240	269880	They should be police.
269880	271400	They only want one thing.
271400	273920	They want you to do a good job executing the show.
273920	280220	The idea is not, like, no, I would be doing a disservice to television, sir, if I had
280220	284400	an idea already, before I even sit down with these people about what these shows are going
284400	285400	to be about.
285400	286400	They're going to be about pickle farmers.
286400	290400	They're going to be, I changed my mind, they're going to be about rollerbladers.
290400	293920	No, no, you know what, fuck rollerbladers.
293920	300920	They're going to be about human spiders, unless that's not what they want.
300920	302640	I want to see the human spider show.
302640	309880	It's weird, because they're human, but they're spiders.
309880	313440	There's going to be some very, very funny situations that arise from that.
313440	316200	You should call it a spider man.
316200	320160	Yeah, all right, I like it.
320160	321160	Spider human.
321160	323760	Yeah, well, Cheers wasn't an idea.
323760	324760	It's a bar.
324760	328000	Well, that's what I mean.
328000	330120	Do you have your, is it a taxi stand?
330120	331120	Is it a bar?
331120	333280	Why not let them handle that?
333280	337520	Why not let them say, you know what's hot these days?
337520	338520	Slinkies.
338520	341560	Yeah, you're right, slinkies with two E's and a Z.
341560	342560	That sounds like a good idea.
342560	344360	No, I'm making it sound like I'm going to write something dumb.
344360	345360	That's not the point.
345360	349240	The point is I'm going to go, I'm going to hoist my sails to the wind that's there.
349240	354680	Unfortunately, I furnished the rumor mill with a lot of rumors about what a shitty boss
354680	355680	I was.
355680	360240	I don't know, I haven't seen any official accounts of how bad I was at my job.
360240	363400	Do you think that you were a shitty boss, though, by your own standards?
363400	367440	Well, no, not by my own standards, but the problem is it's an elitist industry, so certainly
367440	372400	by the standards of the poor fucker that has to haul cable down on the set, who would have
372400	378160	to haul it, you know, his job is harder the more time I take with a script or something
378160	379160	like that.
379160	382960	But yeah, by his standards, by anybody's standards who's like, who would prefer the
382960	389520	schedule work better, you know, yeah, I'm a shitty boss because I took my work too seriously.
389520	395000	Do you think that you can easily slip from single camera half hour into a multi-camera?
395000	398080	No sweat, buddy.
398080	401840	Here's the thing, more cameras.
401840	407280	It's like if in baseball, you can have two bats in your hands, but that's more cable
407280	408480	for more sorry fuckers.
408480	414000	Yeah, but they're going to get home by five, N-word.
414000	417280	Because you're going to, you know, you're putting on a little play every week.
417280	420920	You can't just say N-word with, you know, I think that you're not, that people don't
420920	421920	know what you're saying.
421920	424240	They know what you just called me.
424240	428800	Yeah, but the point of the N-word is not the actual, the word isn't like abracadabra that
428800	431360	actually casts a magic spell.
431360	434960	Can you feel all the eyes burning the back of your head?
434960	438560	You're ambassador African American in the front row.
438560	442400	The only two black people in the building are seated in the front row right now.
442400	449080	You're so lucky you sat in the front row because if you were in the back, like turning, turning.
449080	452240	But anyway, no, I'm right on this one.
452240	455560	I don't mind, like you say the word N-word, you mean two things.
455560	460800	You know what I mean culturally, but also if I'm saying it instead of actually saying
460800	465640	it, what it means is I respect the idea that it's a, that the word is an insult.
465640	466640	You know what I mean?
466640	467640	Does that make sense?
467640	468640	Yeah.
468640	469640	Yeah.
469640	470640	Because the word...
470640	471640	Don't ask me.
471640	472640	Ask him.
472640	473640	The word isn't...
473640	474640	Well, I'm not going to ask...
474640	475640	I'm also...
475640	476640	He's not...
476640	477640	He doesn't get to answer for the whole race.
477640	478640	That's racism.
478640	479640	It's not...
479640	482840	Fuck him or I love you.
482840	487480	It depends on you and your individual performance as a human being.
487480	492160	That's non-racism is when we don't know for a moment, like we don't think that he's talking.
492160	501960	He's not the Borg.
501960	504520	The problem is the intent behind the word.
504520	505520	Language doesn't...
505520	508320	The English language is a bunch of sounds that we make.
508320	514120	Do you know, like I went to Montreal, there's a bunch of stores there called Couche Tard.
514120	517160	To them it means, I don't know, big savings or something.
517840	518840	I don't know.
518840	519840	My sister's retarded.
519840	520840	She wouldn't like it.
520840	523040	Well, she wouldn't know, but...
523040	527280	But Couche Tard is offensive over here to both tards and couches.
527280	528920	What's a couche?
528920	529920	I don't...
529920	534360	You know, it's what your Scottish friend would call a wizard.
534360	535360	We just found out...
535360	536360	We have a Scottish friend.
536360	541440	We just found out that a slang term for vagina is wizard sleeve.
541440	542440	Wizard sleeve.
542440	543440	I thought she said wizard.
543440	547920	I was like, that's the first great word for a vagina, like a first...
547920	549520	That's so respectful.
549520	553200	It's not like this oracle.
553200	557680	It looks like you're going to it for instruction and enchantment.
557680	561520	But to me, men are visual thinkers.
561520	565840	It conjures up a wizard old dude with a beard and a robe.
565840	567800	That makes you a hero.
567800	570400	That tells you when you're doing it right and when you're doing it wrong, that has all
570400	571400	the power.
571400	575200	I am calling pussies wizards from now on.
575200	578120	I think that's fucking beautiful.
578120	580120	Sleeve is gross.
580120	585800	Envelope, wallet, any object, like a sheath, you know, obviously what you're saying is
585800	587880	it's an object and that's no good.
587880	589840	We stumbled onto it on an accident.
589840	591560	Call it a wizard.
591560	596000	And if it's really fucking nice and you really love the woman, call it Merlin.
596000	599520	I was like, man, I was with Tabitha last night.
599520	602040	She's got a fucking straight up Merlin, bro.
602040	609880	Man, but I was out with Tabitha and she's got a Voldemort, man.
609880	610880	Right?
610880	611880	Is that a wizard?
611880	612880	I don't know.
612880	613880	Yeah.
613880	614880	But I think a good one, isn't it?
614880	615880	I don't know.
615880	616880	Is Voldemort good or bad?
616880	617880	He's bad.
617880	618880	Okay.
618880	619880	A guy went like this.
619880	620880	He gave a thumbs down.
620880	624480	If this was being shot like a multi-camera thing, like with the audience, like if it
624480	625480	was like, who's lying to...
625480	626480	They would use you.
627280	630200	You would be on TV because you gave a thumbs down and he said, it's bad.
630200	631200	Voldemort's bad.
631200	633680	The editors would be like, oh, I like him.
633680	634680	I like him.
634680	638840	See, I thought he was giving me the thumbs down because that was not a funny enough reference.
638840	639840	No, no, no.
639840	640840	He's just fucking immersed.
640840	641840	He was like, oh, no.
641840	642840	Voldemort's bad.
642840	643840	The price is right.
643840	646680	Is there a funnier bad wizard than Voldemort?
646680	647680	It has to be.
647680	649680	Who else is a bad wizard?
649680	650680	Zoran is good.
650680	651680	Zoran.
651680	652680	Zoran.
652680	653680	I don't know Zoran.
653680	654680	Zoran.
654680	655680	The gay wizard.
655880	657480	The gay wand.
657480	659840	Anyways, I think that's beautiful.
659840	660840	The wizard.
660840	661840	The wizard.
661840	662840	Baby, I'm going to...
662840	663840	I don't know.
663840	664840	I can go to town on your wizard tonight.
664840	668560	I don't want to have sex more than I did before I...
668560	669840	I want to talk about the wizard.
669840	671440	I want to see your wizard.
671440	674000	I want to go to your wizard for...
674000	676000	I want to become a hero.
676000	680920	Anyway, so I don't know if it's worth getting back to the n-word root of that tangent, but...
680920	681920	Oh, it's worth it.
681920	686320	So the English language, like any language, is just a bunch of sounds we make to make
686320	687840	ourselves clear.
687840	690960	The intent behind the words we use.
690960	694720	And it's a beautiful thing that we're able to discern intent from language.
694720	695720	That's the miracle.
695720	699400	It's the intent that you want to police.
699400	703760	You want to know whether or not someone is actually racist, not whether they said a combination
703760	705960	of words that's technically racist.
705960	708880	When you fall into that game, guess who's really good at it?
708880	712320	A bunch of fucking lying, shitty, racist fuckers.
712320	714360	That's who's really good at it.
714360	716400	Look how many...
716400	721760	As soon as they caught on to the idea that we're figuring out that bad people are racist,
721760	728280	all genuinely racist, shitty, evil people do is they just put Condoleezza Rice next
728280	729280	to them.
729280	731160	And they go, like, this makes me a good person, right?
731160	736280	According to your definition, don't give them that power by being hung up on technicalities.
736280	739800	The idea of non-racism is that the race doesn't matter, period.
739800	740800	Doesn't matter.
740800	745800	I was a dumb tanned, now I've turned into Lenny Bruce.
745800	751840	Anyways, I say N word, you know what I mean.
751840	756000	Dan and I, we don't do it as much as we used to.
756000	761280	But lots of times at parties, via Dan's or my place or someone else's place, we would
761280	762280	start freestyle rapping.
762280	766800	You know, some white dudes just freestyle rapping.
766800	772040	We do improv, so we kind of fancy ourselves good to varying degrees.
772040	774440	It's hard to do freestyle rap without...
774440	779240	You don't say N word then, you use the N word.
779240	781520	And that's always when Demortes would walk by.
781520	785760	You use the N word like people put pepper on their salad.
785760	792120	I fucking love it, and rap, that word is fucking delicious, fucking licorice.
793120	797320	We're kind of licorice.
797320	798320	N word-ish licorice.
798320	802320	If I was able to say it, that'd be a fucking awesome rhyme.
802320	807000	We're at some party, we're all going to run into a circle, we're like, okay, let's talk
807000	808000	about bacon bits.
808000	809000	Bacon bits, rap with you.
809000	810000	Yeah.
810000	811000	Yo, yo, bacon bits.
811000	815320	It's salty and brown, and you go, I want it around, put it on your salad, N word makes
815320	816320	it...
816320	817320	I don't know.
817320	818320	It's just fun.
818320	819320	It's fucking, it's a go-to.
819320	820320	It's like...
820520	821520	But hysterically...
821520	825920	It's like popping the plastic bubbles in the packing.
825920	829120	If you're freestyling, I mean, for better or for worse...
829120	832960	But our friend Demortes would walk by right when you had said it, and be like, oh my...
832960	835520	Demortes always knew right when I was going to say the N word.
835520	837520	Because you were rapping.
837520	842360	Yeah, he was like, I'm going to go check that out.
842360	843360	And that's what he sounds like.
843360	844360	I'm not being racist.
844360	847280	He has a deeper voice than me.
847280	848280	Very masculine.
849240	851960	How about every time a Johnny Cash song comes on?
851960	852960	Like if...
852960	854960	Well, that's just dicks and balls.
854960	859600	I would offend gay people way more than before I offended black people if they could hear
859600	862600	what I do in the car.
862600	863600	Or maybe not.
863600	864600	I don't know.
864600	865600	Because I don't...
865600	866600	Yeah.
866600	867600	Any Johnny Cash song.
867600	876120	I put a hundred wieners in my mouth, I put my dick in the north and in the south, I put
876120	883720	my balls and anus in my dick, I suck the balls, I lick the dick.
883720	884720	It doesn't...
884720	885720	It doesn't...
885720	887200	It's so fun.
887200	888200	I want to record an album.
888200	889200	They love it.
889200	890200	They love it.
890200	900200	I put wieners in my balls and in my nuts, I put my dick and my anus as a butt.
900200	903800	The fact that nuts rhymes with butts, by the way, is a fucking godsend.
903800	905400	That's amazing.
906160	908080	The only thing that rhymes with mouth is south.
908080	909080	You're fucked.
909080	911920	As soon as you say mouth, Jeff starts rolling his eyes like, I guess something's gonna be
911920	913640	south next.
913640	916800	But fucking nuts and butts.
916800	919480	Like candies and nuts.
919480	921760	That's fucking great for Johnny Cash riffing.
921760	925800	I'm telling you, let's make Johnny Cash song and just start tapping your foot and just
925800	926800	fucking go for it.
926800	927800	You don't have to be clever.
927800	928800	Just talk about...
928800	929800	I hear the door.
929800	930800	Oh, I'm sorry.
930800	931800	We'll start again.
931800	932800	We'll start again.
932800	933800	Okay, sorry.
933800	934800	I'm not as familiar with this one, but it'll probably work.
934800	935800	Yeah.
935800	936800	All right, I'll start you out.
936800	937800	I see your wiener coming.
937800	938800	It's coming in my mouth.
938800	941800	I've sucked in every direction from the north into the south.
941800	957800	Then I put your balls inside me and shoved them in my butt.
957800	975480	I got sent to Folsom Prison for licking dicks and nuts.
975480	976480	You take this one.
976480	977480	Come on.
977480	978480	Come on, Jeff.
978480	979480	We'll go back and forth.
979480	991760	This is... forget when he starts.
991760	996280	I put my dicks inside my mama's ear.
996280	1005840	I put my shoe inside here if she's queer, and if she's there, I say come over here because
1005840	1006840	she's gay.
1007840	1010840	I fuck her ears.
1010840	1012840	Everybody.
1012840	1016840	See, that came off as homophobic if you're gay and you're in the audience.
1016840	1019840	No, it came out as anti-grandma.
1019840	1020840	Yeah.
1020840	1022840	Anyways, let's try to avoid it.
1022840	1027840	I want to record an album called Getting It Out of My System because you should see my
1027840	1028840	girlfriend's eyes roll.
1028840	1031840	It's like, Jesus Christ, when are you going to get tired of that?
1031840	1032840	I don't know, man.
1032840	1035840	Dicks and balls and nuts and butts and...
1035840	1036840	It's never...
1036840	1037840	I can't stop.
1037840	1038840	You're never talking about...
1038840	1039840	Do you...
1039840	1042840	You don't like being alone, and do you talk to yourself, and you say you kind of mutter
1042840	1043840	to yourself.
1043840	1044840	When I'm alone at home...
1044840	1047840	I don't know if I share this with any of you out there.
1047840	1048840	I live alone.
1048840	1050840	I haven't had a girlfriend in a thousand years.
1050840	1052840	I'm a bachelor.
1052840	1055840	I'm always either nude or in my underwear, and I'm singing.
1055840	1060840	I'm rapping, I'm singing, I'm dancing, and it's so stupid, and I play a game with myself.
1060840	1062840	Can I embarrass myself?
1062840	1063840	Can I do...
1063840	1067840	Can I get up to go make a sandwich from my couch and do a dance that even I go, dude,
1067840	1068840	come on?
1068840	1069840	And I can.
1069840	1071840	It is possible to embarrass myself.
1071840	1074840	And as I told you last week, I can't do it, so that's why I have a girlfriend.
1074840	1076840	I keep her around because I...
1076840	1078840	You reminded me, I pulled this up.
1078840	1083840	I went to see Jesus Christ Superstar with Aaron in New York, and there's a song in there
1083840	1087840	that's like, why should you want to know?
1087840	1089840	Don't you know about the future?
1089840	1090840	That song.
1091840	1093840	It was so locked in my head.
1093840	1097840	Jesus Christ Superstar is filled with these infectiously catchy earworm songs,
1097840	1098840	and you can't stop.
1098840	1102840	If you've never seen it, I swear it's the most obnoxious thing.
1102840	1104840	It's the first time you watch Jesus Christ Superstar.
1104840	1106840	For the next three weeks, your friends are going to hate you,
1106840	1110840	unless they're on the same mushroom and doing it with you.
1110840	1113840	You're just going to be humming these songs and other stuff.
1113840	1116840	And I got reinitiated into it, and I wrote this down.
1116840	1118840	This is how pathetic I am.
1118840	1120840	Because I was like, I'm really onto something here.
1120840	1123840	Why put wieners in your butt?
1123840	1127840	Don't you know your butt's for pooping?
1127840	1131840	You got to keep the dicks outside.
1131840	1135840	If you use your butt for wieners,
1135840	1139840	you're going to make it get too wide.
1139840	1143840	I have one that I created on the tour bus.
1143840	1144840	Yeah, I know this one.
1144840	1146840	To Lionel Richie.
1146840	1148840	Stuck in you.
1148840	1153840	I got my penis so deep in your hole, now my dick's in your shoe.
1153840	1157840	That's a long way.
1157840	1160840	That is a long way.
1160840	1162840	Lionel's right.
1162840	1164840	Alternate timeline Lionel Richie is right about that.
1164840	1166840	That's a long way when your dick's in the shoe.
1166840	1168840	I thought you were going to do the Pringles thing.
1168840	1169840	We've done Pringles dick before.
1169840	1170840	Yeah, but just come on.
1170840	1171840	For the nation.
1172840	1175840	Has anyone heard the Pringles dick song here before?
1175840	1176840	Oh, they couple.
1176840	1177840	Good.
1177840	1178840	Yeah, come on.
1178840	1179840	These are all new people.
1179840	1181840	On the tour bus, I don't know if you guys have ever been on the road
1181840	1183840	taking a road trip.
1183840	1186840	I've traveled around with some comedians and we do a thing.
1186840	1189840	For some reason, our tour manager insists on Pringles.
1189840	1192840	I don't know if any of us truly loves Pringles, but they're there.
1192840	1194840	They're ubiquitous.
1194840	1196840	I picked up a tin of Pringles.
1196840	1199840	The full tennis ball size canister of Pringles.
1199840	1200840	I held it to my dick.
1200840	1202840	Do you want to sing it with me or show it?
1202840	1203840	No, you do it.
1203840	1204840	Come on.
1204840	1205840	Take your phone.
1205840	1208840	As I'm sitting with a Pringles dick in my lap, it gets a big heart on me.
1208840	1213840	Some people call me Pringles dick, but I never really found out why.
1213840	1215840	I don't really have a Pringles dick.
1215840	1218840	I just keep my dick inside.
1218840	1224840	I keep my dick inside a Pringles can because it keeps my penis warm and dry.
1224840	1228840	Some people call me Pringles dick, but I never really found out.
1228840	1231840	I never really found out why.
1237840	1239840	It's really satisfying.
1239840	1242840	We have a deep abiding passion for making up songs.
1242840	1246840	We were talking weeks ago about how we miss golfing.
1246840	1247840	We were golfing nine holes.
1247840	1249840	That makes it sound like a bunch of rich twats.
1249840	1252840	No, it's that shitty one in the outwater building.
1252840	1253840	It costs three cars.
1253840	1254840	It costs five bucks.
1254840	1255840	Everyone should go golfing.
1255840	1256840	It's a good exercise, whatever.
1256840	1257840	I'm not going to sell it.
1257840	1258840	Fuck you.
1258840	1261840	I am a rich twat.
1261840	1263840	I was golfing with Jeff.
1263840	1265840	We spent all nine holes the entire time.
1265840	1267840	It just takes an hour and a half or something.
1267840	1268840	For us.
1268840	1269840	I was like, we got obsessed.
1269840	1273840	I started singing the night court theme, which is like...
1278840	1282840	A lot of you will be lost by this because you don't have that night court theme locked
1282840	1283840	in your head.
1284840	1286840	I started riffing lyrics to it.
1286840	1287840	Then we got obsessed.
1287840	1291840	We got to fucking syllabically lock it with this perfect Rubik's Cube.
1291840	1296840	It has to sound exactly like the theme to night court's lyrics.
1296840	1299840	If the producers of night court heard it, they would go, that's it.
1299840	1300840	That's perfect.
1300840	1301840	Nothing ironic.
1301840	1302840	Does anybody here know?
1302840	1304840	Can anyone think of the night court theme?
1304840	1307840	Do you have it clear in your head that...
1309840	1310840	That was our challenge.
1310840	1316840	We have to come up with night court lyrics that are perfect, that match it syllabically
1316840	1321840	perfect, that are tight, no fucking um's, playing syllabic games where you're like,
1321840	1323840	no repeating words, just to fill in a syllable.
1323840	1327840	But also, it had to pass muster with the producers of night court in our head.
1327840	1331840	I think if you and I stay friends to the day we both are dead...
1331840	1333840	We'll never write a more perfect song.
1333840	1336840	And also, I think that was the acme of our friendship.
1336840	1338840	I think you and I have never been closer.
1339840	1340840	I've never been more productive.
1340840	1341840	We've never been more joyful.
1341840	1343840	We've never been more on the same team.
1343840	1346840	So I'd like to present to you my theme from night court, because I can't say all that
1346840	1347840	and then not do it.
1349840	1350840	Days...
1355840	1360840	Days in the courtroom aren't much fun.
1363840	1366840	Come to the night court.
1366840	1368840	Everyone...
1371840	1373840	Your frown's on trial.
1373840	1375840	Approach my smile.
1375840	1379840	I sentence you to stay a while.
1386840	1389840	And we were like just jumping up and down on the ninth hole.
1389840	1390840	We did it.
1390840	1391840	We did it.
1391840	1392840	We fucking did it.
1392840	1394840	It's like that video game that no one can understand.
1394840	1395840	Your mom comes in and goes,
1395840	1397840	Why are you getting so frustrated by this thing?
1397840	1399840	Why don't you just cheat or stop playing?
1399840	1400840	Then you'd win.
1400840	1402840	And you don't understand, mom.
1402840	1405840	I gotta collect all my cactus coins.
1405840	1406840	Made it up.
1406840	1407840	That's not a reference.
1407840	1409840	There's no game out there with cactus coins.
1409840	1412840	There was the putt one, the too much pepper one, too.
1412840	1413840	Yeah.
1413840	1415840	Too much pepper.
1415840	1420840	Yeah, I hit it way farther past the hole than I originally was.
1420840	1421840	And I went,
1421840	1424840	Too much pepper on the pussy.
1424840	1425840	That's all I had.
1425840	1426840	I just said that.
1426840	1432840	And I think there was families on the adjacent holes.
1432840	1433840	And I said,
1433840	1436840	Not enough salt on the balls.
1436840	1439840	And then we spent the next hour trying to finish the song.
1439840	1440840	Yeah, but by the eighth hole we had,
1440840	1443840	Mom is in the kitchen making titties too,
1443840	1447840	and Dad's making business calls.
1447840	1448840	It took us a long time.
1448840	1450840	I was golfing on that same course,
1450840	1451840	the pitch and put in the bell.
1451840	1453840	We're all terrible.
1453840	1454840	But I hit a ball.
1454840	1456840	It was just the worst shot.
1456840	1458840	And I yelled the C word while we're at it.
1458840	1459840	I just went,
1459840	1461840	Can't!
1461840	1463840	And I look over and there's a father on a green
1463840	1467840	right like 20 yards away from me with two young boys
1467840	1468840	just staring at me.
1468840	1469840	The boys don't know what it is,
1469840	1470840	but the father gave me a look like,
1470840	1472840	What are you doing?
1472840	1473840	And I went,
1473840	1475840	I can't golf!
1479840	1481840	I was double knight in a wizard's sleeve!
1484840	1486840	I can't golf!
1486840	1488840	Well, good save.
1488840	1490840	He didn't buy it for a second.
1492840	1495840	I sacrificed my entire literary career,
1495840	1497840	as in books, by doing this,
1497840	1498840	by telling you this.
1498840	1500840	Because there's a very good chance
1500840	1503840	that the guy I had a conversation with on the phone today,
1503840	1505840	who would have been,
1505840	1508840	if it weren't for me telling you this,
1508840	1510840	on a podcast,
1510840	1512840	he would have been my literary agent.
1512840	1513840	He would have ensured,
1513840	1516840	he would have maybe introduced me to book publishers.
1516840	1517840	Now he'll hear this and go,
1517840	1518840	Why are you making fun of me on your thing?
1518840	1519840	Fuck you.
1519840	1521840	But I have to tell you this quote.
1521840	1522840	He said it,
1522840	1524840	and I couldn't hear the next eight things he said.
1524840	1525840	I was like,
1525840	1526840	I'm getting this exactly right,
1526840	1528840	because it's amazing what you just said.
1530840	1533840	And I will preface it by saying if he is listening,
1533840	1535840	it's not like I think that you're an asshole
1535840	1536840	or stupid or anything.
1536840	1538840	It's just what you said was fucking amazing
1538840	1539840	and had to be put under glass,
1539840	1542840	like the Declaration of Independence.
1542840	1544840	It's a declaration of meaninglessness.
1544840	1547840	Was this a prepared statement that you think he said?
1547840	1548840	No, no, he was just finding words.
1548840	1549840	He was just talking.
1549840	1550840	He's just talking.
1550840	1552840	It's amazing what the human brain can come up with
1552840	1553840	when you're just talking.
1553840	1556840	Because he was explaining the current market out there.
1556840	1558840	I was explaining what kind of books I would write,
1558840	1559840	if I could write a book,
1559840	1563840	and what kind of idea would be more sellable than another.
1563840	1566840	And he was explaining the book market place to me,
1566840	1567840	and he said,
1567840	1572840	you know, we're living in a world of extreme caution,
1572840	1575840	except in cases where caution goes out the window,
1575840	1578840	in which case things can become quite reckless.
1581840	1586840	That is the literary market in a nutshell.
1589840	1597840	I make up words when I'm talking,
1597840	1599840	because I don't know what to say.
1599840	1602840	I'm going to string some thoughts together
1602840	1604840	and they might come out gay,
1604840	1607840	but I don't mean homosexual.
1607840	1610840	I don't want to offend anyone.
1613840	1616840	I mean gay like it was retarded.
1617840	1619840	There I go.
1619840	1620840	God.
1621840	1623840	There you go again.
1624840	1627840	By the way, my sister's retarded.
1627840	1629840	So, cha-ching.
1630840	1632840	A comedic cha-ching.
1634840	1637840	Now, was there a discussion after he said that?
1638840	1639840	No, I was just...
1639840	1642840	Maybe he heard my thumbs rattling on my iPhone.
1642840	1644840	I was like, oh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
1644840	1645840	Whatever you're saying,
1645840	1646840	he was probably telling me the cure for cancer,
1646840	1647840	and I was like,
1647840	1648840	how can we get this right
1648840	1651840	before it seeps out of my 39-year-old brain?
1651840	1653840	Fred Willard much?
1654840	1655840	I was out of town.
1655840	1656840	I missed the news.
1656840	1658840	Well, no one was there,
1658840	1659840	or he wouldn't have done it.
1659840	1661840	What do you mean you were out of town?
1661840	1662840	We were all out of town.
1662840	1665840	I'm just saying I had nothing to do with it.
1665840	1668840	I was not around a TV or a newspaper or anything.
1668840	1670840	I only bring it up because I want to talk about
1670840	1672840	how insane it is that people are still bothering
1672840	1673840	to arrest people.
1675840	1676840	What were the details of the actual case?
1676840	1677840	If you don't think...
1682840	1685840	If anyone's buying admission to your porno theater,
1685840	1687840	they're obviously just a pre-internet person
1687840	1688840	that wants to jerk off.
1688840	1690840	Leave them alone.
1690840	1691840	The idea...
1691840	1692840	Okay, here's the thing.
1692840	1694840	If there's a law, if there's a statute,
1694840	1697840	if there's a by-law regarding what we do
1697840	1699840	with our penises in public,
1699840	1704840	it's probably well-founded in some pre-internet history, though.
1704840	1707840	The idea behind the first person to say,
1707840	1709840	oh, you can't jerk off in a movie theater...
1711840	1712840	It was a leprechaun.
1713840	1714840	It was Sheriff...
1719840	1720840	Oh, Johnson.
1721840	1722840	The idea of that was like,
1722840	1725840	oh, these movie theaters are so new
1725840	1728840	and the women's titties are so big on the screen.
1728840	1730840	Everyone wants to just jerk off everywhere.
1730840	1732840	If we don't put a cork in this,
1732840	1734840	it's going to spread to the streets.
1734840	1736840	That's not a risk anymore.
1736840	1738840	Those are like elephant graveyards.
1738840	1740840	The only thing that's going to happen in there
1740840	1743840	is a couple people that are left that don't have laptops
1743840	1744840	just like jerking off.
1744840	1745840	Who cares?
1745840	1748840	I've never been inside one of those establishments,
1748840	1750840	but it seems to me that if I walked in there,
1750840	1753840	I would see five or six guys jerking off.
1753840	1755840	I would assume, yeah.
1755840	1757840	Why are you getting so high-voiced about it?
1757840	1761840	They're not entitled to it, but don't get out a flashlight.
1761840	1765840	What do you think you're going to find out is happening?
1765840	1766840	What is that?
1766840	1768840	What are you looking for?
1768840	1770840	A guy writing his thesis?
1770840	1773840	What are you trying to dig up in a fucking...
1773840	1775840	Look at the business you're engaged in.
1775840	1777840	Has it been proven?
1777840	1779840	I don't know anything.
1779840	1781840	Basically, I'm one of these comics.
1781840	1783840	I just heard a thing in the lobby.
1783840	1785840	No idea what actually happened.
1785840	1789840	The only way it came to my attention was on Twitter
1789840	1791840	and everybody coming to his rescue.
1791840	1793840	Nobody wants to fuck with Fred Willard.
1793840	1794840	He's hilarious.
1794840	1797840	Also, there's a victimless crime.
1797840	1799840	Even more than a victimless crime,
1799840	1802840	he was making at least one person happy.
1802840	1805840	We need more of that.
1805840	1810840	Go pick on somebody who's doing something wrong to anybody.
1810840	1813840	What I'm probably doing is contributing to the problem
1813840	1817840	because the story probably...
1817840	1820840	I didn't actually research it.
1820840	1823840	But then again, if I did, all I'd be reading is a bunch of...
1823840	1826840	I was acquainted with this process.
1826840	1830840	There's a Chinese telephone that happens online
1830840	1833840	and now I'll be quoted as saying that Chinese people are bad
1833840	1836840	at making telephones.
1836840	1841840	It's like the blogs, they just quote each other now.
1842840	1845840	Gone are the days of confirming things,
1845840	1848840	talking to three different sources independently.
1848840	1850840	There's no journalism left.
1850840	1854840	This just in, something is just in over there.
1854840	1857840	It can get pretty fucking nuts pretty fast.
1857840	1861840	For all I know, Fred Willard did absolutely nothing.
1861840	1865840	He probably ate a piece of popcorn.
1865840	1867840	On the off chance that he was jerking off,
1867840	1869840	I also am on his side.
1869840	1872840	If I saw Fred Willard or me or you or anybody in this room
1872840	1875840	walking into one of those theaters at 2 p.m.,
1875840	1878840	I would think that person's going to go jerk off.
1878840	1882840	And if it was Fred Willard, I'd offer to let him come on my face.
1882840	1884840	Now we're getting somewhere.
1884840	1889840	Because he's amazing and he's like, whatever.
1889840	1892840	It's jerking off, monkeys do it.
1892840	1895840	They do it with frog's mouths.
1895840	1897840	Let's not talk about it.
1897840	1898840	What's that one monkey?
1898840	1900840	Everyone's just fucking everybody.
1900840	1903840	It's straight, it's gay.
1903840	1905840	The bonobo chimp, our closest genetic relative,
1905840	1907840	the bonobo chimpanzee.
1907840	1911840	For a long time, scientists ignored the fact
1911840	1914840	that the bonobo chimp, out of all the varieties of chimps,
1914840	1918840	chimps are 99% identical to us genetically.
1918840	1920840	The bonobo chimp is 99 point something.
1920840	1922840	It's as close as you can get to human
1922840	1924840	while staying a chimpanzee.
1924840	1926840	It's our closest relative.
1926840	1929840	And they do nothing but fucking jerk off.
1929840	1932840	They have incest, they have gang bangs,
1932840	1934840	they have gang wars,
1934840	1936840	and then they settle the gang disputes
1936840	1939840	by everybody fucking each other.
1939840	1942840	Sisters and brothers and moms and uncles and fucking.
1942840	1945840	And if you've got nothing to do, you're just jerking it.
1945840	1947840	These are horrible.
1947840	1950840	By our standards, it's like, this is why the human race
1950840	1952840	needs to give itself a break.
1952840	1955840	We didn't invent anything that makes us unseemly.
1955840	1959840	We didn't invent assassination, lying, war, anything.
1959840	1961840	The only thing that makes humans different
1961840	1964840	from all of our primate cousins is compassion.
1964840	1966840	That's the one thing that we bring to the table
1966840	1967840	that's brand new.
1967840	1970840	We bring the concept that we actually kind of like each other
1970840	1972840	and would even sometimes take a bullet for each other.
1972840	1974840	That's our thing.
1974840	1976840	That's what humanity is.
1976840	1979840	All this stuff that we think is like original sin
1979840	1982840	and all this stuff, it was invented by squirrel creatures
1982840	1983840	that came before us.
1983840	1986840	They started lying to each other with their faces.
1986840	1989840	The first thing that happened is things that were climbing in trees,
1989840	1992840	these mammals, they developed stereoscopic color vision
1992840	1996840	because it helped them, number one, jump from branch to branch.
1996840	2000840	Our eyes face forward, like 3D, so you can see in 3D.
2000840	2005840	Unlike dogs and turtles and shit, you have depth perception,
2005840	2007840	so you can jump from a branch to a branch.
2007840	2010840	Then the other thing is, meanwhile, color vision, why fruit?
2011840	2014840	You can tell the fruit's rotten, what the good stuff is.
2014840	2018840	With all of that, then the hair starts falling away from the face
2018840	2022840	because what's happening at the same time is socially, sexually, politically,
2022840	2025840	these primates, as they became,
2025840	2029840	they start communicating with each other with these new pieces of equipment,
2029840	2032840	these state-of-the-art eyes that can see in vivid color
2032840	2035840	and just maximum resolution.
2035840	2039840	The hair comes away from the face and our musculature in our faces
2039840	2042840	becomes incredibly overdeveloped so we can make all these weird faces
2042840	2045840	way before we could talk, way before we could do any of that.
2045840	2049840	We were lying to each other by winking and squinting and smiling.
2049840	2052840	These little squirrel-like creatures, even before they were monkeys,
2052840	2054840	they were starting to do that shit.
2054840	2059840	You can leverage your fellow primate by going,
2059840	2062840	hey, that guy likes you over there, not as much as she does.
2062840	2065840	She says weird shit about you, but I don't agree.
2065840	2067840	Everyone's fucking with each other
2067840	2070840	because it means the difference between life and death.
2070840	2074840	And they invented that shit, not us. We inherited it.
2074840	2077840	We don't have to be bad people to each other.
2077840	2080840	Humanity does not give itself a break.
2080840	2084840	Speaking of breaks, some of you may have been here two weeks ago
2084840	2087840	when my lovely girlfriend, the love of my life, Erin McGathey,
2087840	2089840	was a guest comptroller.
2089840	2091840	You can applaud for her, I guess.
2091840	2094840	But that means nothing now that I asked you to.
2094840	2096840	I don't have her back or anything.
2096840	2099840	If you guys ask me to, I'll sell her out in a second.
2099840	2104840	Erin is funnier than me, smarter than me.
2104840	2107840	Don't hold that against her or anything,
2107840	2110840	and don't try to prove that that's not the case.
2110840	2116840	But she and Jeff, like beta fish, they both love me very much.
2116840	2120840	And one of their primary points of contention is,
2120840	2123840	we like to have game nights.
2123840	2127840	And Erin likes to explain and run games.
2127840	2132840	So some of you even in this audience have been back to my place, Dandudu,
2132840	2138840	where we'll play like catchphrase or apples to apples or celebrity.
2138840	2141840	Erin, thankfully, because I don't want to do it,
2141840	2145840	she always steps up and wants to control the game.
2145840	2151840	Jeff and her had an evening once where it was very uncomfortable for me,
2152840	2154840	and that's what matters.
2154840	2157840	Erin was trying to explain the game of catchphrase.
2157840	2160840	For 45 minutes.
2160840	2163840	Conservatively 40 minutes.
2163840	2165840	People had to pee.
2165840	2167840	People were peeing their pants.
2167840	2169840	And then Jeff, after we gave up,
2169840	2170840	because people were like,
2170840	2172840	can we just drink and have a fun time?
2172840	2173840	Yeah, let's do it.
2173840	2176840	And then Jeff, as a big fan of efficiency,
2176840	2179840	explained to Erin privately in the corner of the party
2179840	2182840	how badly she had done explaining the game for two hours.
2182840	2184840	Not true. Not true.
2184840	2186840	There's a lot of subjectivity.
2186840	2188840	No, it's not true.
2188840	2190840	The important, the objective truth.
2190840	2193840	I was going to keep saying it until the behavior changed.
2193840	2196840	The objective truth is that there was a little tender spot there.
2196840	2199840	It was an event.
2199840	2203840	Erin has a great desire to get up and run a game night, which is great.
2203840	2204840	You need someone to do that.
2204840	2207840	If you're game playing people, let's all play catchphrase.
2207840	2208840	Let's play apples to apples.
2208840	2211840	Let's play the Leonard Maltin movie game.
2211840	2213840	Let's do that.
2213840	2215840	I'd say get on with it.
2215840	2218840	You know, I would say at some point let's start playing the fucking thing.
2218840	2220840	I mean, this was like Nicholas Nickleby, man.
2220840	2224840	It was like an eight-act play of how to play a game.
2224840	2226840	And our friend David Butler leans up and goes,
2226840	2230840	so it's like $20,000 pyramid, except you can't use your hands?
2230840	2233840	I'm like, yeah, yeah.
2234840	2239840	So I have made my stance on Erin's love of gameplay
2239840	2244840	versus the incredible deficit between her ability to do it functionally.
2244840	2245840	I've gone on record.
2245840	2247840	I've been very candid about it.
2247840	2252840	So let's play a new segment at Harmontown.
2252840	2254840	She proposed, let's do a segment.
2254840	2257840	We don't know anything about it other than its title.
2257840	2261840	It's called Erin McGathey's Game Corner.
2264840	2265840	Wait.
2265840	2268840	Do you want to pick a theme song or anything?
2268840	2269840	Let me see what I got.
2269840	2270840	Say it again.
2270840	2276840	It's called Erin McGathey's Dream Corner.
2276840	2277840	I'm sorry.
2277840	2278840	We'll take it again.
2278840	2279840	We'll take it again.
2279840	2284840	It's called Erin McGathey's Game Corner.
2285840	2288840	Thanks for that intro, guys.
2288840	2289840	Super supportive.
2289840	2290840	Really nice.
2290840	2291840	Just try it.
2291840	2292840	We're just trying to help.
2292840	2296840	This isn't supposed to be a bit about how I'm bad at explaining games.
2296840	2297840	Speed it up.
2297840	2298840	Oh.
2298840	2299840	Just, yeah.
2299840	2305840	Welcome to Erin McGathey's Game Corner.
2305840	2306840	Corner.
2306840	2311840	The two players in tonight's game are Dan Harmon and Jeff Davis.
2311840	2316840	If we can have them sit in the McGathey Game Corner seats.
2316840	2321840	The game tonight is the Anthony game.
2321840	2322840	The Anthony game.
2322840	2323840	Everyone loves it.
2323840	2324840	Everyone plays it all the time.
2324840	2325840	The Anthony game.
2325840	2326840	Is there a reason for that?
2326840	2327840	I don't know.
2327840	2328840	I don't know.
2328840	2329840	I don't know.
2329840	2330840	The Anthony game.
2330840	2331840	The Anthony game.
2331840	2332840	Everyone loves it.
2332840	2333840	Everyone plays it all the time.
2333840	2334840	The Anthony game.
2334840	2337840	Is there an Anthony in the audience who I interviewed earlier?
2337840	2338840	All right, Anthony.
2338840	2339840	Come on down.
2339840	2345840	Let's give a round of applause for Anthony.
2345840	2347840	All right.
2347840	2353840	Also, is there anybody precocious and in need of some stage time?
2353840	2355840	Right now, just raise your hand.
2355840	2356840	Green shirt.
2356840	2357840	You got a smiley face on it.
2357840	2360840	That's the guy that gave the thumbs down to Dumbledore.
2360840	2361840	All right.
2361840	2362840	Come on down.
2362840	2365840	We could go ahead and sit right here.
2365840	2366840	All right.
2366840	2368840	What is your name?
2368840	2369840	Smiley face.
2369840	2370840	Justin.
2370840	2371840	Justin.
2371840	2372840	All right.
2372840	2375840	Tonight's game is the Anthony game.
2375840	2386840	Before the show, I walked out and I saw Anthony in line and I interviewed him about his life.
2386840	2392720	The two of you are going to answer questions about Anthony's life.
2392720	2401840	The first person to 15 points wins the McTrophy because my last name is McGathey.
2401840	2402840	The McTrophy.
2402840	2403840	The McTrophy.
2403840	2407840	There are four different categories that you can choose from question-wise.
2407840	2408840	Love.
2408840	2409840	Childhood.
2409840	2410840	Personality.
2410840	2411840	And wild.
2411840	2421840	Anthony, before we get started, can you tell Jeff and Dan, what do you do, Anthony?
2421840	2422840	I'm a PA.
2422840	2423840	You're a PA?
2423840	2425840	Are you a PA for anything right now?
2425840	2426840	No, not right now.
2426840	2428840	I mainly work in post-production.
2428840	2429840	Great.
2429840	2430840	What's your favorite sound effect?
2430840	2431840	My favorite sound effect?
2431840	2432840	Just do it.
2432840	2435840	I like the slide whistle.
2435840	2438840	Let's hear what it sounds like.
2438840	2439840	Perfect.
2439840	2440840	All right.
2440840	2443840	That's all you get to know about Anthony.
2443840	2447840	Welcome to the Anthony game.
2447840	2449840	All right.
2449840	2451840	So, Jeff, you're going first.
2451840	2456840	You can choose from the category love, childhood, personality, or wild.
2456840	2457840	Love.
2457840	2460840	Anthony and his girlfriend have been dating for A?
2460840	2461840	False.
2477840	2478840	15 points?
2481840	2484840	A real hero.
2484840	2486840	Anthony and his girlfriend have been dating for A?
2486840	2487840	One year.
2487840	2488840	B?
2488840	2489840	One month.
2489840	2490840	C?
2490840	2492840	He does not currently have a girlfriend.
2492840	2496840	I hate to dog pile.
2496840	2499840	I'm going to go with C.
2499840	2500840	That is correct.
2500840	2502840	He does not squarely have a girlfriend.
2502840	2505840	One point on the board for Jeff Davis.
2505840	2509840	Your best years are ahead of you.
2509840	2510840	All right.
2510840	2511840	Dan Harmon.
2511840	2512840	I hope so.
2512840	2514840	Love, childhood, personality, or wild.
2514840	2515840	Personality.
2515840	2516840	Personality.
2516840	2523840	Before the show, Anthony described himself as one of the four seasons.
2523840	2525840	Well, he's lying.
2525840	2526840	He's white.
2526840	2528840	Or fall.
2528840	2530840	Not the band.
2530840	2531840	Oh.
2533840	2534840	They're all white.
2534840	2535840	Oh, shit.
2535840	2537840	I thought you meant the four tops.
2537840	2539840	I got him confused.
2539840	2540840	He's Frankie Valley.
2540840	2541840	Frankie Valley.
2541840	2554840	Which of the four seasons, winter, spring, summer, or fall, did Anthony describe himself
2554840	2555840	as?
2555840	2556840	Definitely fall.
2556840	2559840	That is correct.
2559840	2563840	He's wearing autumnal colors even.
2563840	2566840	He actually has the fall foliage colors.
2566840	2569840	And his eyes are dying.
2570840	2574840	Once beautiful leaves, they're turning.
2574840	2576840	He's falling into it.
2576840	2579840	Anthony Gay.
2579840	2580840	All right.
2580840	2582840	The game where Anthony gets made fun of.
2582840	2583840	Jeff Bryan Davis.
2583840	2585840	There will only be one loser.
2591840	2594840	There better be a cash prize for him, by the way.
2594840	2596840	Yeah, I'll give it to him.
2596840	2597840	All right, Jeff.
2597840	2598840	Here we go.
2598840	2599840	Wild.
2599840	2600840	Wild.
2600840	2601840	Wild.
2602840	2608840	Anthony has A, never broken a bone, or B, never broken a sweat because he has a sweat
2608840	2610840	gland disorder.
2613840	2614840	Hey.
2615840	2616840	You are correct.
2619840	2620840	Harmon.
2620840	2622840	Love, childhood, personality, wild.
2622840	2623840	Love.
2623840	2624840	Love.
2625840	2631840	His least favorite thing, Anthony's least favorite thing about women, his pet peeve
2631840	2633840	with women, he dates.
2638840	2646840	Is A, that they're overly controlling, B, that they're overly sensitive, or C, that
2646840	2648840	they're overly slutty bitches.
2649840	2652840	I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to,
2652840	2654840	this is the guy who's not your accessor.
2654840	2659840	This is the guy yelling out, C, by hook or by crook.
2659840	2661840	He seems like a good kid, so.
2661840	2664840	All right, sensitive or, or, or, or controlling.
2664840	2665840	Sensitive or controlling.
2665840	2670840	His biggest complaint about women would be, he would, I would say A, A, controlling,
2670840	2671840	controlling.
2672840	2673840	Anthony.
2673840	2674840	It's B.
2674840	2675840	Sensitive.
2675840	2676840	Fuck.
2676840	2677840	I'm sensitive.
2677840	2678840	It's, it's extra.
2678840	2682840	Like whenever we don't get one right, it's like shit.
2682840	2683840	Another question.
2685840	2688840	That just added seven minutes to the show.
2688840	2689840	Get them right.
2689840	2690840	Let's fuck up.
2690840	2691840	We should start conferring together.
2691840	2692840	We're going to open up to the crowd.
2692840	2693840	We're going to get this.
2693840	2694840	And now.
2694840	2695840	The 10 point round.
2695840	2698840	We enter the lightning round.
2700840	2701840	Entering the lightning round.
2701840	2709840	Anthony's favorite part of the women's body is A, boobs, B, butt, C, back, D, the top
2709840	2710840	softest part of their head.
2710840	2711840	Legs, legs, legs.
2711840	2712840	Wait, that wasn't an option.
2712840	2713840	Tits.
2713840	2714840	Back.
2714840	2715840	Back.
2715840	2716840	The back of the tits.
2716840	2717840	It's back, back.
2718840	2719840	It's back.
2719840	2720840	It's called the lungs.
2720840	2722840	Anthony's celebrity crush.
2722840	2725840	You have to wait until the end of the question.
2725840	2726840	Jennifer Aniston.
2726840	2729840	Is A, Emma Watson, B, Kate Blanchett, C, Keira Knightley.
2729840	2730840	Go.
2730840	2731840	And Watson.
2731840	2732840	Yes.
2732840	2733840	Dan is correct.
2733840	2734840	It's Emma Watson.
2734840	2745840	Anthony was born in Denver, raised in A, Miami, B, Boston, C, New Orleans, D, Modesto, E, Cleveland.
2745840	2746840	Jesus Christ.
2746840	2755840	D, D, F, A, B, C, D, F, Modesto, Miami, Boston.
2755840	2757840	There are other ones.
2757840	2758840	You said everyone.
2758840	2759840	Miami, Boston, New Orleans.
2759840	2760840	Modesto, Cleveland.
2760840	2761840	Cleveland.
2761840	2762840	Yes.
2762840	2763840	Jeff is correct.
2763840	2764840	Jesus Christ.
2764840	2765840	This game has loopholes, Dan.
2765840	2766840	There's loopholes.
2766840	2768840	You can just say them all.
2768840	2769840	Anthony's favorite.
2769840	2770840	You can just say them all.
2770840	2775840	Remember them all and say them in order.
2775840	2781840	That one was hard because there was 11.
2781840	2782840	That kind of threw us.
2782840	2785840	The human brain remembers seven things.
2785840	2789840	When Jeff does this, he, A, hurts my feelings.
2789840	2791840	B, makes me feel bad about myself.
2791840	2793840	C, makes me feel insecure.
2793840	2795840	All of the above.
2795840	2796840	All right.
2796840	2797840	Here we go.
2797840	2798840	Childhood.
2798840	2799840	Anthony.
2799840	2802840	We're all very, we're friends.
2802840	2803840	I know.
2803840	2804840	Okay.
2804840	2805840	All right.
2805840	2806840	All right.
2806840	2807840	Anthony's favorite show.
2807840	2808840	I'm just making fun of you.
2808840	2811840	That's fine.
2812840	2817840	Your, your, your bit implies that you would, you would actually prefer if we were very stoic
2817840	2818840	and took it off.
2818840	2819840	That would be fucking horrible.
2819840	2821840	Play the game, Harmon.
2821840	2824840	Like you don't want us to take this seriously.
2824840	2826840	No, I don't.
2826840	2829840	Maybe my part of the bet is that I'm reacting to what you're doing.
2829840	2830840	Okay.
2830840	2831840	All right.
2831840	2832840	We're all yes.
2832840	2833840	And each other.
2833840	2834840	Yeah.
2834840	2835840	It's like inception.
2835840	2836840	What's my favorite movie?
2836840	2837840	All right.
2838840	2839840	All right.
2839840	2841840	When Dan and I have sex, he A, makes me wear a tie.
2841840	2843840	B, makes me wear a suit.
2843840	2845840	C, makes me come my hair and gel it.
2845840	2848840	D, makes me come pretend that I'm controlling a show.
2848840	2849840	No laugh.
2849840	2850840	I'm sorry.
2850840	2851840	All right.
2852840	2854840	Dustin, edit that out.
2854840	2855840	All right.
2855840	2856840	Here we go.
2856840	2857840	His Anthony's favorite.
2857840	2858840	Leave it in.
2858840	2859840	That stays in the fucking cut.
2859840	2860840	I'm really sorry.
2860840	2862840	We're halfway done, you guys.
2862840	2868840	Cirque du Soleil is coming out at the break.
2868840	2873840	Anthony's favorite show as a child was A, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
2873840	2874840	B, She-Ra.
2874840	2875840	C, Simpsons.
2875840	2877840	B, the New Kids on the Block cartoon show.
2877840	2878840	Simpsons.
2878840	2879840	New Kids on the Block cartoon show.
2879840	2880840	She-Ra.
2880840	2881840	Simpsons is correct.
2881840	2883840	He's not old enough for She-Ra.
2883840	2884840	You dumb asshole.
2884840	2885840	All right.
2885840	2887840	The first person to describe.
2887840	2888840	Sorry.
2888840	2890840	Anthony's sibling situation.
2890840	2893840	Like how many brothers and sisters?
2894840	2895840	Suicide.
2896840	2897840	Will they?
2897840	2898840	Won't they?
2899840	2900840	Object shame.
2900840	2903840	I made up a new word that's all, it's a compound word.
2903840	2904840	Object shame.
2905840	2906840	I'll take the answer.
2906840	2907840	Who said hot?
2907840	2908840	Me.
2908840	2909840	So I've got 14 points right now.
2909840	2910840	All right.
2911840	2912840	Final question.
2912840	2913840	Final.
2913840	2914840	We're tied at 14, right?
2914840	2915840	Final question.
2915840	2917840	I'm not good at math, but I'm pretty sure we're tied.
2917840	2918840	Justin?
2918840	2919840	This is the final question.
2919840	2921840	It's worth 80 points.
2921840	2922840	There we go.
2922840	2924840	That's the stuff.
2925840	2935840	Was he brought up A, Methodist, B, Baptist, C, Catholic, D, Pentecostal?
2935840	2938840	I know this.
2938840	2940840	My vote, D.
2940840	2941840	What?
2941840	2942840	Pentecostal.
2942840	2944840	Because I know one other person from Cleveland.
2944840	2945840	He was Pentecostal.
2945840	2947840	I'm going Pentecostal as well.
2947840	2948840	What?
2948840	2949840	That is incorrect.
2949840	2954840	I'll give you another chance to pick your answer.
2954840	2955840	Presbyterian.
2956840	2957840	Methodist?
2957840	2958840	What was the helmet?
2959840	2960840	Baptist.
2961840	2962840	I'll say Methodist.
2962840	2963840	I'll say Baptist.
2963840	2964840	Methodist.
2964840	2965840	Catholic.
2965840	2966840	Yes.
2966840	2967840	Catholic.
2970840	2971840	We did it.
2971840	2972840	All right.
2972840	2973840	Final score.
2973840	2976840	Justin, here, let me get you on the mic.
2976840	2977840	Final score.
2977840	2978840	Thank you, Aaron.
2978840	2984840	Final score was Dan 4 and Jeff 30 million and 11.
2984840	2987840	Let's hear it for our scorekeeper, Justin.
2987840	2988840	Thank you.
2988840	2991840	For Anthony, for enduring all of the scrutiny.
2991840	2993840	And also for Aaron McGathey.
2993840	2996840	Aaron McGathey's Game Corner.
2997840	3002840	Anthony, I'm giving you a crisp one day of PA pay.
3002840	3003840	Yes.
3004840	3006840	That was fucking rough on him.
3006840	3007840	That was rough.
3009840	3011840	Well, yeah, Anthony wants to say something.
3011840	3012840	I think he's entitled.
3013840	3017840	I think that's the best version of a game show about my life that there could be.
3022840	3024840	Jeff just matched the 100.
3024840	3031840	So Anthony walked away $200 richer and just an irreplaceable piece of his soul shy.
3032840	3034840	I'm sure that's money.
3035840	3036840	I.
3038840	3042840	Did anyone else in here sympathize most with me?
3044840	3046840	Let's really put yourself in my shoes.
3047840	3051840	Who cares whether she's good or bad or whether he's right or wrong.
3052840	3053840	What about me?
3054840	3058840	Put yourself in my shoes in the sitcom of my life.
3059840	3061840	These two going at each other.
3062840	3064840	It's a rough life for me.
3064840	3066840	This is happening to me.
3067840	3069840	I think she's fantastic.
3069840	3071840	I think you're fantastic too, Jeff.
3072840	3074840	I wish you two would just fucking get it over with.
3077840	3079840	I think she thinks the same thing about us and.
3082840	3085840	Now, Dan, I know that we might have drifted kind of far afield,
3085840	3087840	but tonight we announced that the topic tonight.
3087840	3088840	It was technology.
3088840	3089840	Technology.
3089840	3091840	So let's roll into these technology questions.
3091840	3093840	Yeah, Harmon, as a dutiful mayor of Harmontown,
3093840	3096840	went amongst the attendees here, the loyal Harminians,
3096840	3099840	and went out and asked people technology questions.
3099840	3103840	I pulled a few out of the bucket here.
3103840	3105840	Would you like me to crack this off, Dan?
3105840	3106840	Yes, yes, yes.
3106840	3107840	Crack it.
3107840	3109840	In no particular order, let's do.
3109840	3114840	By the way, tonight's question round is brought to you by a sponsor.
3114840	3116840	This is what Jeff and I have decided we're going to do.
3118840	3120840	We're going to break the mold with sponsorship.
3120840	3122840	We're not going to just do the Adam and Eve spot
3122840	3123840	that you hear on other podcasts.
3123840	3126840	There's a couple of people who are financing podcasts right now.
3126840	3128840	We're in the early days of this new medium,
3128840	3131840	and what's happening is there's a couple of sponsors
3131840	3133840	that are kind of bankrolling everybody.
3133840	3135840	We have overhead.
3135840	3138840	You saw us give a couple of hundreds to Anthony.
3138840	3140840	Just threw it at him.
3140840	3143840	Just fucking destroyed your soul.
3143840	3145840	Here's a hundred, kid.
3145840	3148840	We got that kind of overhead, so we're going to hold out.
3148840	3151840	We're not going to do spots for sex toys or whatever.
3151840	3155840	You hear, like, on This Feels Terrible or any of those podcasts
3155840	3157840	or Mark Maron.
3157840	3159840	Coming for you, bro.
3159840	3160840	We want the big ones.
3160840	3161840	We're going to pioneer.
3161840	3163840	I want Nike.
3163840	3166840	And the way we're going to get Nike isn't going to be by going hat in hand.
3166840	3170840	We're going to do spots for free for fucking Adidas
3170840	3173840	until Nike begs for mercy.
3175840	3177840	You hear that, Nike?
3177840	3179840	You fuck faces.
3179840	3182840	You give us our fucking money or we're going to keep promoting Adidas,
3182840	3184840	you pieces of shit.
3184840	3187840	The tables are turned inward.
3187840	3190840	I own both Nike and Adidas.
3190840	3192840	I'm wearing Adidas because those Nike people,
3192840	3194840	they just won't fucking pick up the phone.
3194840	3196840	They don't give a shit what people think.
3196840	3200840	George Bush and Nike don't give a shit about black people.
3200840	3202840	Adidas.
3202840	3204840	Adidas?
3204840	3207840	Adidas, I think they helped in Katrina.
3207840	3208840	They did.
3208840	3211840	I didn't do any research, but I'm pretty sure they did.
3211840	3214840	Adidas flew in a giant shoe and everybody got in it.
3214840	3217840	I'm pretty sure Adidas loves everyone of all colors,
3217840	3219840	and I'm wearing the shoes to prove it.
3219840	3223840	So this one is brought to you by Adidas, Nike.
3223840	3226840	Harmon, let's see here.
3226840	3227840	I like TV.
3227840	3230840	I like the internet, someone posits.
3230840	3233840	Does internet hurt TV overall?
3233840	3235840	Yeah.
3235840	3238840	All right, next question.
3238840	3241840	You see, Aaron, it can be done.
3246840	3248840	There's a lot of robot questions.
3248840	3250840	I want to get to some robot questions here.
3250840	3253840	Here's one I liked a lot.
3253840	3257840	Is the singularity nigh, and if so,
3257840	3262840	how will it affect my sex life be as specific as possible?
3263840	3266840	Is this the physical singularity,
3266840	3268840	the possible of all mass and matter in the universe?
3268840	3269840	Re-coalescing?
3269840	3272840	Into one, into one infinitely small,
3272840	3274840	infinitely dense point.
3274840	3276840	That's the opposite of the Big Bang, right?
3276840	3278840	So come up here, sir.
3278840	3279840	Come up here.
3279840	3281840	Tell us what the singularity is.
3281840	3284840	Is it a sitcom?
3284840	3286840	I just watched Terminator, Sericon, and Chronicles,
3286840	3290840	and they defined it.
3290840	3291840	Here we go.
3291840	3294840	Become so smart that they can replicate themselves
3294840	3297840	with smarter versions of robots.
3297840	3299840	That's what they said.
3299840	3301840	All right, all right.
3301840	3305840	Can I get a second nerd pinion?
3305840	3307840	All right, you come up.
3307840	3309840	This guy, he's got a shirt on that says,
3309840	3312840	God is a moog.
3312840	3313840	You're not a musician.
3313840	3314840	That's okay.
3314840	3316840	So technological singularity,
3316840	3320840	technology becomes so advanced that it exceeds human intelligence.
3320840	3321840	Like Skynet.
3321840	3322840	Yeah, like Skynet.
3322840	3325840	Okay, all right.
3325840	3327840	You guys are not enemies of each other,
3327840	3331840	and when the singularity does come,
3331840	3333840	they're going to drive a wedge between you.
3333840	3336840	You're going to be in the same trench
3336840	3340840	using dogs to detect rubber people.
3340840	3341840	Get along.
3341840	3343840	Raise your standards.
3343840	3344840	Lower them.
3344840	3345840	All right.
3345840	3351840	No, the singularity is not nigh because of capitalism.
3351840	3353840	You can't make a fucking flash drive
3353840	3356840	that works on two computers in the same day.
3356840	3357840	We are a long ways.
3357840	3359840	We have to have a complete societal collapse
3359840	3361840	before we're able to make technology
3361840	3364840	that actually functions in a cohesive way.
3364840	3366840	We're still trying to figure out.
3366840	3367840	We're all caught up.
3367840	3369840	We have so much technology right now.
3369840	3371840	We could make anything we wanted.
3371840	3373840	We have the technology to make like a robot dude
3373840	3375840	that would walk around and high-five everybody.
3375840	3378840	We just can't do it because the Sony says,
3378840	3380840	well, it should have a memory stick in it.
3380840	3382840	And then Microsoft is going,
3382840	3385840	I think it should have a micro bead.
3385840	3388840	All right, Harmon, here's another question.
3388840	3390840	What fictional piece of technology
3390840	3393840	would you most like to see in real life?
3393840	3396840	For example, hoverboards, they say.
3396840	3397840	What fictional piece of technology
3397840	3398840	would you like to see in real life?
3398840	3399840	Right, right, right.
3399840	3400840	Oh, that's great.
3400840	3401840	That's fucking great.
3401840	3403840	That's so great it'll destroy the show
3403840	3405840	because I have to think about it so long.
3405840	3411840	It's like asking a fat kid, what kind of hot dog?
3411840	3415840	Because I'm going to go with wizard sleeve.
3415840	3417840	Hey, that exists, man.
3417840	3420840	It's right down the street.
3420840	3425840	I'm torn between, I mean, I want, okay.
3425840	3429840	Oh, I want virtual reality on a level
3429840	3431840	where video games are just like,
3431840	3433840	like holodeck, holodeck.
3433840	3434840	Fictional reality, I want holodeck.
3434840	3438840	I want to be able to simulate fictional realities.
3438840	3442840	That's the fictional science that I want more than anything.
3442840	3445840	Because teleportation, like all you're going to be able to do
3445840	3447840	is go to Afghanistan really fast.
3447840	3450840	It's still shitty there.
3450840	3453840	You know, I want video games to be so good
3453840	3458840	that I don't care that Afghanis are outside my door.
3458840	3461840	I'm very upset.
3461840	3463840	I want to spend the last years of my life
3463840	3465840	pretending I'm Sherlock Holmes
3465840	3470840	and solving the case of the missing pussy.
3470840	3475840	Easiest case to solve in my version.
3475840	3478840	I'm knee deep in it.
3478840	3481840	Elementary, my dear Watson.
3481840	3487840	Dan, what rights, Dan, what rights do robots have?
3487840	3493840	Three.
3493840	3496840	Robots don't, they don't have rights.
3496840	3499840	They can't, this is a popular thing in fictional, yeah,
3499840	3501840	it's like we look forward to this day,
3501840	3502840	this is a singularity issue too.
3502840	3504840	We're going to eventually create life.
3504840	3506840	This is what humans do.
3506840	3508840	Mythology, I think, is very interesting.
3508840	3510840	I believe, I think Joseph Campbell kind of hinted at this,
3510840	3513840	props, Joey.
3513840	3516840	I read a book, one of Joseph Campbell's books,
3516840	3522840	he referred to the lock and tumbler type of instinct.
3522840	3524840	There's another type of instinct,
3524840	3527840	which is an open-ended instinct.
3527840	3533840	An example of that is a species of moth that they studied
3533840	3537840	where they noticed that the female of the species
3537840	3540840	had a certain shade color of their wings
3540840	3545840	and the males preferred the ladies that had a darker shade.
3545840	3549840	So they made an unreasonably dark winged moth
3549840	3553840	that was like just a fake moth, a Jessica Rabbit moth.
3553840	3555840	And the male moths wouldn't even,
3555840	3558840	at the detriment of their own species,
3558840	3561840	you could put a real live moth in a cage with this other moth
3561840	3564840	and you just put this fake ass Jessica Rabbit moth in there
3564840	3568840	and the male moth would just hump this fucking piece of cardboard
3568840	3572840	because it was darker even though it wasn't even possible for it to exist.
3572840	3575840	So Campbell refers to this open-ended instinct.
3575840	3578840	Some organisms are capable of thinking,
3578840	3581840	here's a great example of lock and tumbler,
3581840	3584840	just to contrast it more, I find this shit so fascinating.
3584840	3586840	There are chicks, baby chicks,
3586840	3590840	there's a species of hawk that fly over chicken coops.
3590840	3595840	The chicks, when they see its silhouette in the sky,
3595840	3597840	they'll head for cover.
3597840	3600840	But they ran, they made a model of a hawk
3600840	3603840	and they ran it over the chicken coop, the chicks run for cover.
3603840	3607840	And then they ran it over backwards and the chicks didn't run for cover
3607840	3610840	because it wasn't the exact image that the chick needs to see
3610840	3613840	to make it run for cover, it was flying backwards.
3613840	3617840	A newborn chick, just born with a script that it was running
3617840	3619840	and if it doesn't fit the cue exactly,
3619840	3622840	then the chick doesn't engage in the behavior instinctively.
3622840	3627840	Contrast that with the moth that wants to fuck the darker chick the better.
3628840	3631840	So humanity's mythology is an open-ended instinct
3631840	3634840	for the behavior that we want to emulate.
3634840	3636840	We have a blueprint on our nervous system.
3636840	3640840	We know the qualities that a perfect being possesses.
3640840	3644840	Our gods are the things that we want to become.
3644840	3646840	We know that our job is to cheat death.
3646840	3649840	We know that it's to populate the universe.
3649840	3651840	We know that we need to create life.
3651840	3655840	And look at what we do to ourselves in the pursuit of perfection
3655840	3657840	and our perfection has nothing to do with ourselves.
3657840	3661840	We kill ourselves, we literally kill each other and ourselves.
3661840	3664840	A plane goes down and we don't make planes illegal.
3664840	3667840	We go, ah, 500 people, fuck it, I hope tomorrow's better,
3667840	3670840	but we've got to fucking do some shit, we've got to get on the moon.
3670840	3673840	We have an open-ended instinct for perfecting ourselves.
3673840	3676840	And one of those things is we are absolutely obsessed,
3676840	3681840	obsessed with, you see, you Google it and it's just like these Japanese robot legs,
3681840	3683840	like, ah, we almost got it, we almost got it,
3683840	3686840	we can make a fucking weird thing go up the stairs and it unsettles us
3686840	3688840	and we go, we're almost there.
3688840	3691840	Like, we want to make people, we want to make ourselves,
3691840	3694840	and we will do it, we're going to fuck ourselves over.
3694840	3696840	They're going to murder us, they will.
3696840	3699840	That's the singularity, I didn't know there was a word for it,
3699840	3702840	but they're going to fucking kill us because they're going to be better than us
3702840	3704840	and we're going to be happy to die.
3704840	3707840	Somebody told me once, it was Steven Notley,
3707840	3709840	the creator of Bob the Angry Flower,
3709840	3713840	the only Canadian I've ever liked.
3713840	3716840	That's going to cost me a couple listeners.
3716840	3719840	Take that, North America.
3719840	3723840	Take that half of the English-speaking continent.
3723840	3728840	Now, he and I, we were talking science one night,
3728840	3732840	he's a huge awesome nerd and he was talking about this thing
3732840	3736840	that he read about the idea that information is the only thing that's evolving
3736840	3741840	and that humans are the patsy, that genetically past information,
3741840	3747840	humans inventing computers represents us passing on the ability
3747840	3750840	to store more information in a more compact space
3750840	3752840	than the universe was able to assemble on its own
3752840	3756840	using just these kind of molecules that are in our cells.
3756840	3758840	We've gotten to the point where these cells in our bodies
3758840	3761840	are just these little computers and they're tightly coiled
3761840	3763840	like little X and Y chromosomes,
3763840	3766840	knotted ropes wrapped around each other, compressed so hard
3766840	3769840	and when they have to reproduce, they unravel
3769840	3772840	and they're like a million miles long and they're just like tangled up.
3772840	3775840	Because that's the technology you're limited to
3775840	3777840	if you haven't invented computers yet
3777840	3780840	and you can't make a computer out of a big bang.
3780840	3782840	You can only make a bunch of molecules run into each other.
3782840	3784840	So we represent the cutting edge.
3784840	3789840	We are the Apple laptop of biological information storage
3789840	3791840	and we are now, what are we doing?
3791840	3792840	What are we obsessed with?
3792840	3794840	To the absolute exclusion of ourselves,
3794840	3796840	there are people starving in the streets
3796840	3799840	and we're stepping over them on our way to develop what?
3799840	3800840	Technology.
3800840	3805840	We need to create ways to store more information than we can store
3805840	3808840	and I really do if there's an unsettling feeling
3808840	3812840	that once we do it, we're just going to be monkeys hanging out
3812840	3814840	and we're going to find out we've been had.
3814840	3817840	Well, somebody asks here, Dan, is the technological revolution
3817840	3820840	the beginning of the human evolution into cyborgs?
3821840	3822840	Yes.
3823840	3825840	But they won't even look like cyborgs.
3825840	3827840	It's just going to be this floating thing.
3827840	3829840	And part of what, that's what I said earlier,
3829840	3831840	humanity needs to give itself more credit.
3831840	3833840	Where are we headed that's so fucking beautiful?
3833840	3835840	Who do you hate, your neighbor?
3835840	3836840	Do you think he's racist?
3836840	3837840	Do you think he's a pedophile?
3837840	3838840	Do you think he's greedy?
3838840	3839840	Do you think he's mad at you?
3839840	3841840	Do you think he's greedy?
3841840	3844840	Like whatever he is, at least he's human.
3844840	3845840	He's not an ant yet.
3845840	3848840	Like so much of what we try to do,
3848840	3850840	lots of best intentions, but we police each other.
3850840	3852840	We go, Daniel Tosh, don't make a rape joke.
3852840	3853840	We caught you.
3853840	3854840	I got you.
3854840	3855840	It's fascism.
3855840	3856840	And we're clamping down on each other.
3856840	3858840	As we enter this age of internet,
3858840	3860840	like everyone's saying shit in comedy clubs
3860840	3861840	that they feel free to say.
3861840	3863840	And then now it goes up on YouTube.
3863840	3865840	And then now you're going to do this new Elizabethan age
3865840	3867840	of like, ah, fuck you, I caught you.
3867840	3870840	Like we want to put this fucking clamp on each other.
3870840	3871840	To what end?
3871840	3873840	When are we going to be perfect?
3873840	3875840	And what is that perfection going to resemble?
3875840	3877840	We are going to be fucked over.
3877840	3879840	We got to embrace the animal side of us.
3879840	3882840	When we feel something, when we feel hatred,
3882840	3886840	like we're at least, there's something happening there
3886840	3889840	that doesn't happen with giraffes, sharks, fucking ants,
3889840	3892840	and whatever this thing we're creating is.
3892840	3894840	We should tread carefully.
3894840	3897840	I said last week, I don't know if I made the final edit,
3897840	3900840	but like we need a pro-human code
3900840	3902840	because we are just this close.
3902840	3903840	We're going to do it.
3903840	3904840	We're going to make these things,
3904840	3906840	and they're going to be more important to us.
3907840	3909840	We need to be prepared to say to those things,
3909840	3912840	fuck you, we're more important because we're stupid
3912840	3914840	or ignorant or angry.
3914840	3915840	We have hormones.
3915840	3918840	Something's valuable about this or not,
3918840	3921840	but that's the side we need to be on.
3921840	3923840	Maybe they are better than us,
3923840	3924840	these things that we're going to create.
3924840	3925840	Fuck them.
3925840	3927840	Have you ever been jealous of someone?
3927840	3928840	Fuck them.
3928840	3929840	That's a human instinct.
3929840	3930840	I'm jealous of you.
3930840	3931840	I don't want you to succeed.
3931840	3932840	I hate you.
3932840	3933840	You're better than me.
3933840	3934840	It's like parents and their children.
3935840	3937840	That incredible jealousy that some parents have.
3937840	3938840	Yeah, we're going to make these things
3938840	3940840	that are going to eat us up.
3940840	3942840	In a certain sense, they're already doing it.
3942840	3944840	The devices, the things that we carry in our pockets,
3944840	3946840	they're swallowing us up.
3946840	3948840	They're changing the way we have sex with each other.
3948840	3950840	They're changing what we say to each other.
3950840	3953840	Every time, what are we doing in the meantime?
3953840	3955840	We're all gathered around this big giant fucking cyborg
3955840	3957840	that we're going to build, and it's going to eat us.
3957840	3960840	That giant cyborg, whether he eats us or not,
3960840	3963840	he will be wearing Adidas shoes, right?
3963840	3964840	Yes.
3964840	3966840	That's thank you for getting to my point.
3966840	3969840	Because that cyborg will make the logical choice
3969840	3971840	for comfortable footwear.
3973840	3974840	Nike.
3976840	3979840	And until such time as I get a giant fucking check
3979840	3981840	from an unnamed company,
3981840	3983840	I'm not going to change my position on that.
3983840	3984840	Yeah.
3984840	3985840	All right.
3985840	3986840	Let's do, Dan, you want to pick a number of words
3986840	3989840	to answer some questions I have in my hand right now?
3989840	3990840	Do you want to limit yourself?
3990840	3992840	This is kind of like...
3992840	3994840	Let's say we leave it to one of the two black people
3994840	3996840	in the front row.
3996840	4000840	I just noticed I've ignored you,
4000840	4002840	which either makes me less or more racist.
4002840	4004840	I don't know.
4004840	4007840	Two black harmontownians in the front row,
4007840	4010840	I say...
4010840	4011840	We'll turn our attention to you, sir.
4011840	4012840	What's your name?
4012840	4013840	Oh, NT.
4013840	4014840	NT?
4014840	4015840	It's called NTI.
4015840	4017840	NTI?
4018840	4020840	It's a cyborg.
4020840	4021840	A cyborg.
4021840	4022840	A cyborg.
4022840	4023840	Singularity.
4023840	4024840	Singularity.
4024840	4025840	That's what it is.
4025840	4026840	The Skynet, of course.
4026840	4027840	The cyborgs will be black
4027840	4029840	because we won't question them as much.
4033840	4034840	If he's in a Starbucks,
4034840	4036840	you're just happy to have him.
4036840	4037840	Makes you feel less guilty.
4037840	4039840	You're not going to like corner him
4039840	4040840	and ask him why are you listening
4040840	4043840	to that weird modem sound.
4043840	4046840	You'll start listening to a modem sound.
4046840	4047840	You fucking love it.
4047840	4048840	It'll seem hip.
4049840	4052840	NTI.
4052840	4053840	NT.
4053840	4056840	Pick a number between
4056840	4059840	two and six.
4059840	4060840	Four.
4060840	4061840	All right.
4061840	4062840	Four-word answers.
4062840	4063840	Thank you, NT.
4063840	4064840	Four-word answers.
4064840	4065840	Thank you.
4065840	4066840	Sorry, racist.
4066840	4067840	Here we go.
4068840	4070840	Where should I go to survive
4070840	4073840	the robot apocalypse of 2014?
4078840	4081840	Flagstaff, Arizona during Christmas.
4084840	4085840	That's not random.
4085840	4087840	I'll explain it later.
4087840	4090840	What is a swamp donkey?
4093840	4095840	Part donkey.
4095840	4097840	Part swamp.
4101840	4104840	Should robot marriage be legal?
4104840	4107840	Only among consenting robots.
4107840	4108840	Nice.
4108840	4110840	Pen or techno pen?
4111840	4114840	Obviously techno pen.
4114840	4115840	N-word.
4115840	4116840	N-word.
4117840	4118840	All right.
4118840	4119840	Thank you very much for coming, everybody.
4119840	4120840	That's been Hymantown.
4120840	4121840	We love you all.
