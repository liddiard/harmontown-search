0	27000	Hello, hello, I am, I am Jeff Davis, and Harman Town is now in session, please welcome the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman!
27000	44000	Did you say, did you introduce me? I didn't hear. Yeah, I introduced you. I based it on the applause.
44000	56000	Bobcat Full Plate, our best controller in Toronto. Wow, we got a double decker full packed house here in Toronto.
56000	70000	At the Boer Theatre, that only shows documentaries. Is that true, really? No, people in the audience are going bullshit, I saw Spider-Man here.
70000	79000	It seems like they secretly show high profiting movies, like Thursday at 11pm. You gotta know a guy.
79000	88000	Yeah, that does seem like a weird move in this day and age. It seems like a really good commercial platform, only showing documentaries.
88000	97000	They might as well just show my movies and just go completely broke. See, that's why I want to kill myself.
98000	111000	For those listening, a guy just showed up. Police Academy is awesome. I haven't made movies in this millennium.
111000	120000	Yeah, the guys are yelling out Police Academy is awesome. I think they're familiar with Police Academy as maybe like a color form?
120000	128000	Well, they're rebooting them, you know. They're going to do what they did the Jump Street. They're going to make them a comedy this time.
133000	144000	They're just going to have modern comedy stars. Nick Offerman as Steve Gutenberg. That sounds delightful. Are they really doing that?
144000	151000	They're rebooting them, yeah. God damn it. What in the world? Just call it cop comedy. A new one.
151000	159000	There's purists who get upset. They go, oh, it's like, really? Because I was in two, three, and four.
159000	165000	I love that your character became a cop. Your character was a criminal in the first one, and then he was a cop in the second one.
165000	169000	Apparently, at the Metropolitan Police Department, they don't have very stringent...
169000	171000	That was the whole idea, baby.
171000	181000	Apparently, I went to Batman jail, where I was out in a week. The two of them I was in was up here in Toronto.
181000	189000	It seems like a nice city. It feels gothamy here a little bit.
189000	196000	It is. When we were making Police Academy, we would have to dirty the streets so it looked like America. This is the truth.
197000	201000	People would come by and clean, like they would pick up the trash.
201000	204000	Get out of here, Canadian! Get out! Get out!
204000	207000	There's Canadians infesting the film stuff. They keep picking up the litter.
207000	211000	Put down that Tim Hortons cup. We put it there on purpose.
211000	214000	Yeah, so they would actually do that.
214000	215000	Canadians.
215000	220000	You know, I had the quintessential Canadian experience on the way here.
221000	227000	There's a lot of cliches that are true, and you guys are friendlier and a little bit nicer, and just deal with it.
227000	230000	I mean, you're snarky, too. I know what you say behind our backs.
230000	232000	No, they will argue with you about anything.
232000	233000	Yeah, they don't tip.
233000	238000	They'll go, we're not nice. You don't hate me, do you?
239000	246000	So I see this guy on a moped while I was walking here to the theater, and he gets cut off and almost creamed, almost hit by this Prius.
246000	253000	And so he catches up with the Prius, and he hits the window, and I'm like, oh, this is good. This is going to go. It's on.
253000	258000	And the guy looks at the other guy, and the guy on the moped looks at him, and then he really angrily waves at him.
262000	267000	Hello! Hi! Have you noticed me?
267000	270000	What was the effort there to give him the finger?
270000	274000	It would have just been bending three fingers, and he's just...
275000	278000	That would hurt me more, though, wouldn't you? As a driver, I'd be like, ah, that guy...
278000	288000	Absolutely. In rare moments in my life, I have experienced, like, I've done it right, just on accident, really, because I was trying to be so sarcastic, and the other person was so nice.
288000	303000	I remember, like, having instances in traffic where, you know, someone's honking at me angrily, and it makes me, puts my ire up, and then I would, like, look over at them, make eye contact with them, and do this big, like, show of like,
304000	311000	like, fully expecting to get shot for it, but then the person in the other car would just, like, start laughing.
311000	313000	That guy just looked at me aggressively.
313000	317000	Yeah, maybe we should all be doing comedy in this moment, like, what is my problem?
317000	329000	I got rear-ended on the 101 during, like, where the traffic was at all to stop, and this guy gets out, and he was a Mexican gentleman, and it was his truck, and we go to exchange each other's insurance,
329000	343000	and then he hands me his license, and it says it was suspended, that his license was suspended, and then I go, dude, just forget it, my car's fine, and he starts crying, and he hugs me, and unlike you, I'm not cool with the hugs.
343000	344000	Unlike me.
344000	350000	Well, all these big, I don't know, man, what is your target audience? We love bears.
351000	357000	It's 600 hours of footage in that movie, like, I hugged eight people.
357000	359000	Yeah, we should say there was a screening this evening.
359000	360000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
360000	362000	And by the way, I love the movie. It was really wonderful.
362000	364000	Oh, yeah, I'm glad you liked it. It's very flattering.
367000	372000	It was very, very sweet and funny, and everything I want, and a movie.
372000	376000	Oh, that's nice. That's good. I know you would tell me otherwise, I think. I mean, not that you're a dick.
376000	378000	I would just say, hey, that was good.
379000	382000	Yeah, you would be polite, but I would know that you didn't like it.
382000	384000	And I can tell you, you saw some merit in it.
384000	390000	Plus, I sat next to you and I was laughing, and I was worried that my laugh sounded like Max Katie in the Cape Fear remake.
392000	401000	I fell asleep because I'm 41, and not because the movie's boring, but because I just, I don't know, I had some of these Mill Street loggers.
401000	403000	Do you want me to tell how it ends?
403000	407000	No, no, I know it is. That's the fact that guy sucks his thumb and says he's not going to change.
409000	416000	But yeah, I woke up to people laughing, and I thought they were laughing at me snoring, and I was like, yeah, make a movie about that.
417000	425000	But yeah, what is that Canadian, like in America, are we socialized to compartmentalize to the point where we become psychotic?
425000	437000	Are we trained? Do people in Canada, because as a region, I don't even know, do you guys, does Canada really consider itself to be a
438000	445000	country? Or do you guys really think about it in terms of like, nah, this is, you know, this is my province.
445000	449000	This is my, you know, because it's different of wherever you go.
449000	454000	Just say America in front of a Canadian, they'll correct you. This is North America.
454000	458000	Technically, Columbus discovered the whole chunk of everything.
458000	464000	Really? Because on the news, when they say America bombed someone today, you don't go, us or them, I'm not sure.
465000	470000	But no, I just want to make sure I wasn't asking in a demeaning way, because I think that would be one part of the enlightened thing.
470000	478000	It's like, why be jingoistic about a big giant swath of land? It feels like Canadian is a little more civic in their mindset.
478000	488000	Sure, sure. No, I mean, perhaps they're a little kinder to their brothers, but they've also got the most fucked up political system going.
489000	491000	The top four to come on.
491000	498000	They're focused on shit that matters. Maybe that's the only other shit that gets back to us.
498000	504000	But it's not like, there is no such thing as like a, you know, Canada really stirred things up at the UN today.
504000	513000	You know, it's like, you know, America continues to rattle its saber on this like, global scale.
513000	522000	So that's the only reason why you would have a reason to think of yourself as an American, as opposed to perhaps a person from Portland or Milwaukee or Los Angeles, which is what really matters.
522000	529000	The key differences are what kind of ways the traffic going. Does your city have a rail system?
529000	533000	How does it spend its money? You know, it's like, it comes down to a civic level.
533000	543000	But I was thinking about this because both of us grew up not far from Canada and the same kind of weather and the same kind of, you know,
543000	550000	focus on humility and shame and oppressive religion.
550000	560000	But I don't know why, because I grew up in Syracuse, nice to come up to Toronto. It was like going to Paris, you know, I mean, it was like, I mean, it was like, yeah, the east side of Milwaukee.
561000	564000	It was like, wow, they really, they really.
564000	573000	These people are very bougie. I used to come up here to, I'd hitchhike with Tom Kenny up here to see Second City and stuff when we were teenagers.
573000	581000	Yeah, when you get into the airport, you feel a very, I don't know, it has a weird futuristic, like a 90s future feel.
581000	589000	I was like suddenly finding myself, I don't think I was that drunk, but I was like, I wanted to go pitch William Gibson like stuff.
589000	593000	I was like, Toronto, 2028.
593000	598000	It's just you're going in the 90s, you're going, wow, they're still hanging out of this grunge.
598000	607000	Oh, no, it's cold. That's why the way it's cold. Yeah, I think that's what it is. It's coldness and sophistication makes you because I started craving
607000	609000	Manhattan's. I was drinking a lot of bourbon today.
609000	613000	Like, why am I not? Why? Why am I doing that? Oh, because I'm not in the desert.
613000	623000	But it does. It does have politics in its own craziness and stuff. It's just that part of growing up in the US, we're not aware of other countries, even the two closest to us.
623000	634000	Do you know what I mean? It's our arrogance. It just seems like too much to take on. Well, have you been spending much time in Quebec?
634000	641000	No, is there other troubles there? Well, when you use English, they're going, do I hate you because you're American or from Ontario?
641000	647000	Like, they have to figure out why they hate you before they give you a rotten attitude. Yeah, they have their own thing up here.
647000	657000	Speaking of weird things, this is something that there's something called Nuit Blanche happening right now, which people are tweeting me about.
657000	668000	And I immediately assumed it was racist. I assumed that it was pagan and probably racist, but I think it's just sort of a Silver Lake-y kind of artist thing.
668000	674000	It's an all-night seven-to-seven art festival, and they do installations all around the city.
674000	685000	All right, high-roaded. But at the same time, I heard some of the installations from last year, and I was like, oh, that sounds great.
685000	701000	Everybody got together, and they made a waterfall in a building. All right. And what was that? It was cool. That's what it was.
701000	709000	What's the literal translation of Nuit Blanche? White Night. White Night. Okay, see, that's why I thought... Yeah, maybe it is racist.
709000	721000	In America, that sounds like crystal knocks. Yeah. It sounds like time for some justice. We got 24 hours to purge.
721000	732000	Nuit Blanche, motherfucker. Don't forget, be a real uppity right now, Mr. Cab Driver, but tomorrow's Nuit Blanche.
733000	746000	We stay away from White Night in the south. Yeah, we went to Scotland, and you were in Scotland at the same time as me, and we didn't look each other up.
746000	751000	The hot mini thing with the torches. Oh, my God. We were like, it was fucking great. We were all walking around with torches.
751000	758000	Yeah, we can't do that here. We can't do it in America. We turned fire racist. That's hard work.
758000	767000	America works hard at racism. You're welcome. We fucking figured out how to make racism like fundamental.
767000	776000	Well, you couldn't do it in the States because everybody would be suing each other. Yeah, that's the other thing. The post-racial America is now a litigious...
776000	788000	I was watching in Hockmanay, it's 5,000 people with torches walking through Edinburgh, and I'm like, what do they do when they accidentally set each other on fire? And someone goes, put them out.
788000	798000	And I witnessed it. I saw some people. There's little kids, and they started to go up in flames, and then the parent went, pack them out. Just like cavemen.
798000	807000	Let's give a baby a torch. There's seven billion pieces of evidence that that's a fine system. We didn't go extinct from burning to death.
807000	822000	Well, and they also... And there's a lot of drinking, too. So they're drunk with torches. Everyone's drunk, and there's wicker everywhere, and there's like... I don't know if the superintendent's inside the wicker thing. You know, I figure he'll scream if he starts to burn.
822000	825000	That's kind of where I was hoping it was going. I thought it was going to be wicker man.
825000	833000	It very much was. That's what I was hoping to eat blanche would be, is that you and I would end up in a tea kettle made out of sticks.
833000	837000	The bees! The goddamn bees!
837000	844000	So have you been brought to us, so will you be brought a-runed to the aboot.
844000	849000	I was trying to think of a way to add Canadian pronunciation to a pagan ritual.
849000	853000	You are a boot to go forth into the...
853000	856000	Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
856000	859000	They say sorry so much. They say so...
859000	865000	I'm mispronouncing it, but, you know, when you watch Degrassi, they say sorry every other word.
865000	872000	It's like a nation of Chippendales. After you. No, after you. After you, cousin. Whatever.
872000	876000	They're the sleeping giant, though. They're just getting ready to kick our ass.
876000	886000	That'd be fantastic. I mean, Canada is like that. That should be we should send Canada to the moon because they would be able to operate there.
886000	892000	They'd be like, we understand we're orbiting something disgusting. Like we get it.
892000	900000	We have limited resources. We can make it work. Okay. We wear a parka or now it's a space helmet. I'm fine with that.
900000	908000	We're still a colony. Fine. We'll humor you there. And then like 30 years later, they'd be like, psych.
908000	916000	Moon bombs. Canadian moon bombs.
916000	921000	Do you think they're just happy to be not part of England? Is that why they're polite?
921000	927000	Aren't they still kind of, though? Yeah, you are. That's where I get cocky.
927000	934000	Don't fucking lecture me. We have political arguments and my Canadian friends go like, yeah, but you guys, you got to get your shit together.
934000	941000	I'm like, fuck you fucking England fuckers. But you fucking gross. I really thought you weren't part of it.
941000	946000	Did you guys get a chance to vote? And you said, no, we're scared.
946000	952000	Yeah, that car broke down and they're like, well, let's just live here. Who cares?
952000	957000	I mean, at this point you can't do it. It's like legalizing heroin. Like, what are you going to do?
957000	962000	How are you going to, what are you going to be an independent Scotland and independent Canada?
962000	967000	I mean, how's it even going to work? Who fucking cares? It's all bureaucracy.
967000	972000	I didn't realize it was going to get so heavy, man. I was here to talk about the police academy.
972000	978000	You got to do that shit in the 1700s. Do it in the 1700s, you fucked up.
978000	987000	You're going to cut some heads off. Look at me. Look what you could have been. Look at the pride.
987000	994000	Look at the culture you could have cried. USA, USA, USA.
994000	999000	Yeah, I mean, yeah, growing up in Wisconsin is essentially you are Canadian. It's that there's no difference.
999000	1005000	Like back when I was a kid, you could walk across the border probably, I think. I'm assuming, I'm assuming.
1005000	1012000	Yeah, we could. And where I grew up, not the same accent, but kind of the same, you know, where they dropped the T's.
1012000	1017000	They just dropped the N, you know, hey, Bob, you know, saw you there on the HBO. Like, they don't pronounce the whole...
1017000	1021000	Right. You don't waste a lot of time opening your mouth a lot.
1021000	1029000	No. Like, in Wisconsin you talk through your nose, so in order to make sure that certain sounds are different from others, you got to make sure that...
1029000	1041000	I could say that I was almost a Canadian because in my high school yearbook, you can count how many kids died from snowmobile fatalities.
1041000	1053000	You know, they are, you know, a steamwise orc there, you know, he didn't even see the bobwire there, you know.
1053000	1055000	In a land where snowmobile...
1055000	1057000	Snowmobile. Not even like people...
1057000	1063000	And people don't even go, hey, you know, we should make some paths or we should instill some laws.
1063000	1067000	Just for the purpose, why don't you just put tires on the goddamn things?
1067000	1071000	We're going to lose a couple, you know.
1071000	1078000	I'm getting out my notepad. I'm going to look at my ever notepad to see if there's anything we need to talk about tonight.
1078000	1088000	There was a guy in the LAX maple leaf lounge, as you know, Canada is famous for its luxury.
1088000	1096000	They have a... They put a... They're a very elitist country. They think that people with more money should be treated much better than people with less money.
1096000	1100000	So, as you can imagine, they're a luxury lounge. That's the thing that...
1100000	1104000	When I get picked up by a car at the airport and the guy was like, not...
1104000	1111000	You know, he was being too practical for me, and I wanted to... I could recognize that all of my American blood cells are screaming out, like,
1111000	1114000	Why don't you fuck it? Don't you understand? I would give you more money.
1114000	1116000	What was he being practical about?
1116000	1124000	He was just like... He's driving a car that's supposed to pick me up from the airport and drop me off at the hotel, but he's making it my problem.
1124000	1132000	Like, he wasn't thinking in advance, like, who am I picking up? Who will be paying me?
1132000	1143000	I should look into that so that I don't have to do that when I drop him off at the hotel, so that he's not sitting there like a jackass, like, having an experience that is essentially more difficult than taking a cab.
1143000	1144000	Well, I took a cab.
1144000	1155000	Yeah. I wanted to have taken a cab. My story is about how I recognize it. Like, oh, this is the American in me, because there's nothing... There's nothing bad that's happening here.
1155000	1161000	There's a guy that's denying me my right to elitism. That's what the big thing is.
1161000	1163000	Did you want him to have a sign, and he didn't...
1163000	1175000	I didn't mind the lack of a sign. But here's the thing, and these are problems that I know you everyday folks can relate to.
1175000	1183000	When you go to a new city, you're supposed to call the driver, and now this guy has got my phone number.
1183000	1186000	Well, I don't even... Here's the thing.
1186000	1195000	Some guy making minimum wage has now got my phone number. I don't think you heard what I said. No, no, no. It's not that.
1195000	1200000	It's just that, you know, there was a time you didn't have to give your phone number to the pizza guy, your cell phone.
1200000	1208000	Well, it's just starting now. In Seattle, I had to call... Like, where's the driver? And then they go, oh, you're supposed to call the guy.
1208000	1214000	I'm like, well, that's not... Nobody told me that. I have to call the guy. I call a cab.
1214000	1218000	I thought the whole... There was supposed to be a tear here. A tear.
1218000	1220000	Yeah, that would make it easier.
1220000	1227000	So then they tell you, like, oh, yeah, it's one of those airports. The drivers can't come near the...
1227000	1230000	This is not a conversation to have in front of these people.
1230000	1235000	Yeah, they're like going, boy, it must be rough. I hate it when my limo driver needs my phone number.
1236000	1246000	But just fantasize in your head, if you could, as a person, it's like when you get off that plane, that first time you see that guy, and it says Harmon on the sign, and you're like, I fucking did it.
1246000	1250000	Mr. Drummond adopted me. I'm moving on up.
1250000	1256000	Yeah. Well, now, I'm assuming you travel on the first class.
1256000	1259000	I can't... Yes. Yes. I can't do anything but.
1260000	1266000	But here's the thing. I started traveling first class when I was a young man. Trust me, I don't have any money now.
1266000	1271000	And I still do because I have five million miles on American Airlines.
1271000	1273000	Literally, you said you have five million miles.
1273000	1276000	I have a card that says, I've seen a million faces and I've rocked the mall.
1276000	1285000	And the thing that's weird is, as a younger man, when I got the line to get on the plane in first class, I was always stopped.
1285000	1290000	They would say, this is first class. And I'd be like, I'm first class, this bitch.
1290000	1294000	No, I wouldn't. I'd go, I'm first class, and I'd mumble and be embarrassed.
1294000	1298000	But I don't know what happened recently where I look like I'm first class, it's just because I'm old now?
1298000	1306000	Yeah, oldness is like, you can be a grody schlub. And if you're old enough, they're like, maybe he invented mustard.
1306000	1307000	Yeah.
1308000	1315000	Maybe it's Stan Lee. I don't know. Let him on. He smells like a fish. Maybe he caught the first fish.
1315000	1321000	I was on a flight recently, and all these age-appropriate women were giving me the big eye.
1321000	1323000	What's the big eye?
1323000	1325000	They were like flirting. They were excited.
1325000	1327000	Okay, little rascal.
1328000	1329000	I tell you, I didn't like...
1329000	1330000	You got the big eye.
1330000	1333000	They were giving me the big eye, and I did not like the cut of their jib.
1334000	1339000	And I'm like, when did this happen? Because as a young man, I didn't have any women flirting with me.
1339000	1347000	But now I'm 52, so 50 and 60-year-old women. And I'm like, I could pull so much steel wool if I wanted to.
1348000	1355000	And it's clear. I'm like, what is it? It's like, look at him. Look at him with those healthy hips.
1357000	1360000	Look at that. I don't even think he...
1361000	1364000	Can I talk to you about... Put a pin in that for a second.
1365000	1368000	Because there was a guy in the Maple Leaf Lounge. It's a luxury.
1368000	1376000	It combines Canada's fine tradition of providing elitist luxury with America's fine tradition of 56K Wi-Fi speeds.
1377000	1381000	So I'm sitting there. I'm dying. And there's a guy sitting across from me.
1381000	1386000	He's got a Bluetooth headset. And he kept... I mean, the guy was doing a character.
1386000	1391000	I thought he was a gorilla marketing or... He kept making these phone calls.
1391000	1397000	And he was speaking so loud. And I'm not one of these people that's like, you know, social... I don't know.
1397000	1401000	I don't care. Whatever. We live in a new world.
1401000	1404000	I know there's people who take a lot of pleasure if they're in a restaurant.
1404000	1407000	And they go like, hey, excuse me. Could you take your phone call outside?
1407000	1411000	They're gonna get all excited about it. I get it.
1412000	1416000	What are we gonna fix the world that's populated by fucking idiots?
1417000	1422000	So this guy was like... But I was like, totally shit. This guy's so loud.
1422000	1425000	It's so crisp. It sounds like David Mamet wrote him.
1427000	1431000	He was just calling. I knew his name. I knew his social security number.
1431000	1434000	I knew everything because he was ordering a watch.
1434000	1440000	He was calling a guy because he had ordered... He was interested in buying a watch.
1441000	1447000	And he wanted to call and confirm his appointment to come by and look at watches.
1447000	1449000	What the fuck?
1449000	1452000	I hope he called his limo driver.
1453000	1460000	So he kept saying stuff. And he kept talking about the jelly bean face or the Pomona face.
1460000	1465000	No, I don't need the jelly bean face. I want the diamonds and the numbers, but not the face.
1465000	1467000	But if he could have a couple options for me.
1468000	1472000	Is he trying to impress... Does he come into the Maple Leaf Lounge?
1472000	1478000	And he tries to hook up with Canadian divorcees or something?
1478000	1482000	Is he running some kind of dirty rat and scoundrel scam?
1482000	1486000	And then he got off the phone for a while and I'm like, thank God.
1486000	1489000	Just focus on my Minecraft, you know?
1489000	1492000	And then five minutes later he called and I wrote it down.
1492000	1494000	I wrote down what he said.
1494000	1497000	He said, hi, I have a reservation for a pickup.
1497000	1501000	He had a slight accent of a determinant origin I'm trying to do my best impression of.
1501000	1505000	I have a reservation for a pickup? Yes.
1505000	1508000	Tango Papa Niner?
1509000	1511000	Tango Papa Niner?
1511000	1515000	I wrote it down. Tango Papa Niner?
1515000	1520000	But he had to keep repeating it because I'm sure the person on the other end was like, what?
1521000	1527000	Tango? Oh, T? Motherfucker! It's not... We're done!
1527000	1529000	He skipped right over Tom.
1529000	1531000	Tango! Yeah, I get it.
1531000	1536000	Like, yes, the military came up with ways to make sure you only had to give bombing coordinates once.
1536000	1540000	Because they were speaking over copper wire in 1941.
1540000	1545000	You don't have to say tango to a fucking Verizon guy. Tango.
1546000	1548000	Tango begins with a T.
1548000	1551000	Got it? So T? Then you fucking...
1551000	1553000	That would have really frosted my cake.
1553000	1555000	Papa?
1555000	1558000	I never heard Papa. What?
1558000	1561000	He clearly watched a lot of Hogan's Heroes.
1561000	1563000	Tango Papa Niner.
1563000	1565000	Papa Bear to Mama Bear.
1565000	1568000	He wants a Rolex and a pickup. That guy's out there somewhere.
1568000	1570000	But I just listen to those guys.
1570000	1575000	I mean, I don't listen like I'm pretending. I just turn and I chime in. I do.
1575000	1581000	It's the quickest way to end it. I go, yeah, yeah, get the watch. You know what I mean? I do.
1581000	1584000	I had a guy in a bathroom stall.
1589000	1591000	That's a story we can all relate to.
1591000	1594000	I was just banging dudes in the bathroom stall. No.
1594000	1597000	And he gets on the phone in the stall next to me and he goes,
1597000	1600000	hey, what are you doing?
1600000	1604000	Wait, I'm sorry. He's in the stall next to mine.
1604000	1607000	And I forget that people are on the phones nonstop.
1607000	1608000	Oh, oh.
1608000	1613000	And so he goes, hey, what are you doing? And I'm like, just crapping, man.
1620000	1625000	And then he continues to talk to the other person. I was like, oh my God.
1626000	1628000	Just crapping, man.
1631000	1636000	When I was on the plane, there was a young lady walking down the aisle and she was on the phone.
1636000	1640000	And I'm not banging on this young lady. I don't think that she's a villain for doing this.
1640000	1644000	I just think this is kind of fascinating that she's on the phone and she's getting on the plane.
1644000	1647000	And she's walking down the aisle and she goes, yeah.
1647000	1650000	Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
1650000	1653000	Okay. Well, I'm getting on the plane right now. Okay. Yeah.
1653000	1656000	I've become one of those people.
1656000	1659000	Yeah. No, I'm literally one of those people.
1659000	1662000	She had the most meta obnoxious phone call.
1662000	1666000	She spent more time addressing it. She's like, yeah, I'm literally one of those people.
1666000	1670000	That's the thing I know. No, I'm on the plane and I'm talking to the phone.
1670000	1673000	People are looking at me like, what?
1673000	1679000	And I'm like, no, I'm not allowed to do that. You've taken that away from me.
1679000	1680000	This is worse.
1680000	1681000	Cut your knees right off.
1681000	1685000	It's like if ants, if somebody like put you down,
1685000	1689000	crotch down naked on fire ant hills in the middle of the desert,
1689000	1693000	and then the ants were like, oh, one of those, huh?
1693000	1698000	Oh, I know what you're thinking. We're going to, yeah, well, here we are. We're ants.
1698000	1701000	Guess we're going to eat your crotch now.
1701000	1703000	I can't believe we're doing this.
1703000	1707000	I guess this guy's like, whoa, fire ants on my crotch.
1707000	1711000	Like, to take away my agency?
1711000	1718000	I was walking down a plane and I made a movie called God Bless America.
1718000	1723000	And this, Alex, I didn't say that for that, but thank you. That's very sweet.
1723000	1728000	And this kid was watching it on his computer.
1728000	1731000	And I'm like, I'm going to blow his mind.
1731000	1734000	And I tap him on the shoulder. I go, hi, I'm Bobcat. Bob Goldthwaite.
1734000	1738000	I made that movie. And he goes, I paid for it.
1738000	1741000	That's a 100% true story.
1741000	1746000	Like, this kid thinks I'm going, oh, piracy.
1746000	1751000	All of his, now I'm understanding celebrities based on Radio Shack commercials.
1751000	1754000	He's just like, I'm going to, I got to go.
1754000	1757000	There's a kid getting on a flight in Burbank.
1757000	1762000	And he just downloaded God Bless America, that dirty little prick.
1762000	1763000	That's so funny.
1763000	1765000	And clearly he didn't. You know what I mean?
1765000	1766000	About how fast it came out.
1766000	1768000	Yeah, he definitely did not pay for it.
1768000	1770000	No, he didn't.
1770000	1772000	Why would you say that if you did?
1772000	1774000	If you have a receipt, you'd be a dick about it.
1774000	1777000	He'd be like, what's up?
1777000	1779000	Ask me.
1779000	1785000	It's a legal download. I woke up, it was on my phone with the YouTube album.
1785000	1790000	I love that the corporate, the industry got their messaging out
1790000	1793000	that much more thoroughly than a filmmaker did.
1793000	1797000	You probably don't care that much if someone steals your work.
1797000	1798000	No, not at all.
1798000	1801000	I shouldn't say that for the distributors.
1801000	1804000	You can't say that. They won't distribute your work.
1804000	1809000	But the kid had been, you think, the suits had gotten to him.
1809000	1811000	He had watched the Emmys. A guy came out and said,
1811000	1813000	Hello, are you enjoying the Emmys?
1813000	1817000	You know what's not enjoyable? Emmy theft.
1817000	1819000	Hi, like these Grammys?
1819000	1823000	Beyonce is going to starve to death. Stop stealing music.
1823000	1825000	Oh, hello. Happy Oscars, everybody.
1825000	1828000	Pirates are afoot.
1828000	1831000	There's so much fucking awareness of Jesus Christ.
1831000	1832000	What the fuck?
1832000	1835000	You guys made your empire out of the fact that it's easy for me to watch
1835000	1837000	your dumb free shit.
1837000	1840000	Now that it's fucking freer and dumber, I'm like a normal thief.
1840000	1846000	But it's also, first of all, thank you for calling my stuff free and dumb.
1847000	1852000	No, but some of us free and dumb as Captain Phillips.
1852000	1855000	Maybe you've seen it. It's an important film.
1855000	1856000	Also free.
1856000	1858000	But also, what am I going to do?
1858000	1859000	You know what I mean? It's me.
1859000	1862000	It's not like they're watching a Clint Eastwood film and they got busted.
1862000	1865000	Well, he's kind of old. He wouldn't really do much either.
1865000	1869000	But Clint Eastwood's very old.
1869000	1873000	He's quite old and he would have no problem with us saying that.
1873000	1878000	And even if he did, what in the hell? What a weird stance to take.
1878000	1880000	These guys love Clint Eastwood.
1880000	1882000	Yeah.
1882000	1884000	I guess they're thinking about, well, they're Canadian.
1884000	1886000	They're thinking about other people.
1886000	1889000	Yeah. Well, you know, never don't wake the sleeping giant.
1889000	1892000	That's all I'm saying.
1892000	1896000	That'll be the Sarah Haver of World War III.
1897000	1903000	Remarks about Clint Eastwood were tipped off a new...
1903000	1906000	Canada has been developing a wall.
1906000	1908000	A nuclear super weapon.
1908000	1911000	They never told anyone about the Canadian wall preventing Americans.
1911000	1914000	I mean, United States citizens.
1914000	1918000	All right. So I just wanted to check in with you about...
1918000	1921000	And I haven't talked to you about this backstage because I don't know.
1921000	1922000	I didn't want to...
1922000	1923000	What?
1923000	1925000	Do you want to talk about your love life at all?
1925000	1927000	Oh, uh...
1927000	1929000	Is that off limits?
1929000	1932000	No, I have a girlfriend, yes.
1932000	1934000	Well, because also...
1934000	1936000	Well, that's the... You also...
1936000	1937000	You married and...
1937000	1939000	Oh, yeah. Yeah, I was married.
1939000	1940000	No, not so much.
1940000	1941000	It's good it's in that order.
1941000	1942000	Right.
1942000	1944000	I haven't talked to you about that at all.
1944000	1946000	You were married the last time I saw you.
1946000	1947000	Yeah.
1947000	1948000	Now you have a girlfriend.
1948000	1949000	Now I have a girlfriend.
1949000	1950000	And it's not your ex-wife.
1950000	1951000	No.
1951000	1952000	Right.
1952000	1956000	Well, my wife and I split up about a year ago at this time, yeah.
1956000	1957000	Yeah. You and I don't...
1957000	1959000	There's been a guy in the bathroom?
1959000	1960000	What's that? Oh, the guy... Yeah.
1960000	1964000	That's a good bit, I guess, to yell at.
1964000	1965000	I know at Harmon you have to...
1965000	1966000	Yeah.
1966000	1970000	People participate in the show, but not in the sense of what they're trying to write comedy.
1970000	1972000	Hey, you can connect that dad to the giraffe thing.
1972000	1974000	It'd be a good callback.
1974000	1975000	I think...
1975000	1976000	I'm just... I'm just...
1976000	1979000	I'm just over here. My name's Stephen Levy.
1979000	1982000	Stephen Levy is the name of my assistant.
1982000	1984000	I just named a real guy.
1984000	1985000	I think...
1985000	1987000	My name's Stephen Levy. I live on Kawaii.
1987000	1990000	Well, Stephen Wysorek actually lived across the street from me earlier
1990000	1992000	that I killed in a snowmobile accident.
1992000	1994000	But...
1994000	1995000	Still alive.
1995000	1997000	So...
1997000	1999000	No, he was actually...
1999000	2001000	He wasn't going for a comedy laugh.
2001000	2006000	He actually could feel my awkwardness and tried to cut the tension.
2006000	2011000	But, you know, he was going for comedy when he connected your relationship to the guy in the...
2011000	2013000	Bathroom. Yeah.
2013000	2015000	Don't exonerate him.
2015000	2018000	I just didn't think we judged here at Harmon Town.
2018000	2020000	No, wait, we don't. We don't.
2020000	2021000	You're right.
2021000	2024000	Oh, crap, and all of you, you know?
2024000	2025000	Okay, no, all right.
2025000	2029000	It's like the third act of Reservoir Dogs in here.
2029000	2031000	Who's judging who?
2031000	2032000	Let's all reset.
2032000	2034000	I have a problem. Well, never mind.
2034000	2035000	What? What?
2035000	2038000	If you have a problem, you should be safe to say it here.
2038000	2043000	Yeah, I would say I have a problem.
2043000	2049000	You know, in your movie and in your life, it's this nerd love, you know?
2049000	2050000	And...
2050000	2052000	Wow, Pen could drop right now.
2052000	2055000	But I have a problem with a lot of nerd culture
2055000	2058000	because I find them just as intolerant as other cultures.
2058000	2062000	And, you know...
2062000	2064000	Whoever yelled out, shut up.
2064000	2066000	See, that's a good bet.
2066000	2068000	Shut up.
2068000	2070000	Go blow a guy in the bathroom.
2070000	2072000	Well, I have always said...
2072000	2075000	My observation about nerd culture has always been that...
2075000	2077000	Or maybe I should say about nerd culture.
2077000	2081000	I think about the individual nerd is that being a nerd, I think, you know,
2081000	2083000	there's a cycle of abuse.
2083000	2085000	So you go like, oh, I'm proud to be a nerd.
2085000	2086000	I love being a nerd.
2086000	2088000	Like, there's a fraternity with other people
2088000	2090000	who you think are abused along with you.
2090000	2094000	But there's also, like, this weird, like, reflexive...
2094000	2098000	Like, if you really gave the average nerd an Iron Man suit,
2098000	2103000	like, I don't know if he'd use it to, like, totally protect everybody.
2103000	2106000	I think he'd do some fucked up shit.
2106000	2108000	He'd be selective.
2108000	2111000	Well, I also think it's like...
2111000	2114000	Yeah, I mean, it's just like what happens in...
2114000	2116000	Pardon my oldie time speak.
2116000	2119000	But, you know, I just witness a lot of nerds acting just like jocks.
2119000	2120000	You know what I mean?
2120000	2122000	Like, they're intolerant and stuff.
2122000	2124000	But the other thing is, is like...
2124000	2128000	It's like a problem I always had with the Revenge of the Nerds movies.
2128000	2131000	The nerds at the end are jocks.
2131000	2132000	They don't...
2132000	2134000	They have the cheerleaders as girlfriends.
2134000	2135000	Yeah, they start...
2135000	2137000	They had semi-consensual sex with them.
2137000	2138000	Yeah.
2138000	2141000	And it's clearly designed by studio executives
2141000	2144000	who just assume every nerd would love to be them
2144000	2146000	instead of, like, why can't you just be yourself?
2146000	2147000	Sure.
2147000	2150000	And, of course, people who cast Anthony...
2150000	2151000	What's his name?
2151000	2152000	Edwards.
2152000	2155000	Anthony Edwards and a Carradine as nerds.
2155000	2157000	You know, who put prosthetic teeth in their mouths
2157000	2159000	and, like, these are handsome guys.
2159000	2160000	Well, they're in Hollywood.
2160000	2163000	They couldn't find a guy with bad teeth.
2163000	2166000	But the... Yeah, no, totally, yeah.
2166000	2170000	I just have a problem with people not being tolerant of others.
2170000	2173000	So, you know, sometimes, like, you know,
2173000	2178000	I just find this kind of nasty nerd culture, you know?
2178000	2179000	I'll go you one better.
2179000	2180000	What?
2180000	2182000	And confuse things all the more.
2182000	2185000	I'm backlashing on the recent nerd,
2185000	2187000	genuine nerd backlash culture.
2187000	2190000	I don't...
2190000	2194000	I don't like this whole, I'm a real nerd...
2194000	2197000	Everyone's calling themselves a nerd now, so...
2197000	2200000	And I'm a real nerd because I have eczema.
2200000	2201000	I'm a...
2202000	2204000	I don't... I think that's horseshit.
2204000	2206000	I think I...
2206000	2208000	I'd like to show you my eczema.
2208000	2210000	Maybe that's what the old ladies saw on the plane.
2210000	2211000	I don't have, like, flaky...
2211000	2213000	Do you think... Is this eczema?
2213000	2216000	Do you look...
2216000	2217000	Let me see where it is now.
2217000	2219000	A bird-busting show in Toronto this weekend.
2219000	2220000	Yes.
2220000	2222000	Show me your eczema.
2222000	2223000	I don't know what it is.
2223000	2225000	I think it might just be not showering for a month.
2225000	2226000	It could be.
2226000	2227000	I'm just sort of peeling apart.
2227000	2229000	No, it's probably eczema.
2230000	2232000	But yeah, I...
2232000	2233000	I don't know.
2233000	2234000	I just like...
2234000	2236000	I feel like, oh, this is separatism.
2236000	2237000	It's like...
2237000	2239000	Well, you're talking about my ex-wife, she would say,
2239000	2241000	I'm not a nerd because I go to Comic-Con.
2241000	2244000	I'm a nerd because I complain about Comic-Con.
2244000	2247000	I mean, I think if you are...
2249000	2255000	If you are worried that what's in your brain,
2255000	2257000	should it come out of your mouth,
2257000	2259000	you wouldn't get you elected president?
2259000	2260000	You're a nerd.
2260000	2261000	And I think if that...
2261000	2265000	If we end up finding out that 249 million of us are nerds,
2265000	2267000	then we get to walk up to the White House and go,
2267000	2268000	you're out.
2268000	2270000	Like, I think that...
2270000	2271000	I feel like...
2271000	2272000	Sort of like...
2272000	2273000	I don't know.
2273000	2275000	I feel like there's a nerd revolution where everyone's like,
2275000	2276000	I'm a nerd too.
2276000	2279000	That's the nice thing about the third act of Revenge of the Nerds,
2279000	2281000	is that they go, you know what?
2281000	2283000	Come on down here if you think you're a nerd,
2283000	2286000	and being a nerd becomes popular.
2286000	2287000	Yes, there's irony to that.
2287000	2289000	And then you based your career on that?
2289000	2290000	Yeah.
2290000	2291000	I'm going to be the...
2291000	2292000	I'm going to get so laid.
2292000	2297000	I'm going to be the holding coffee of nerds.
2297000	2298000	I don't know.
2298000	2300000	I just don't know.
2300000	2303000	There's a new thing now where it's like...
2303000	2306000	There's people who go, I'm a real nerd.
2306000	2308000	I don't just look cute in glasses.
2308000	2311000	That hipster word, the word hipster now,
2311000	2314000	we're just working towards a world where hipsters come forward
2314000	2316000	and go, yes, I am a hipster.
2316000	2317000	But...
2317000	2320000	I'm tired of being picked on by nerds.
2320000	2323000	But when I heard that...
2323000	2325000	I like cool music, all right?
2325000	2326000	Fine.
2326000	2330000	When I hear people making fun of using hipster as a derogatory term,
2330000	2332000	you know, I'm like...
2332000	2335000	I don't find that threatening, you know?
2335000	2336000	You know what I mean?
2336000	2338000	Like a hipster to me.
2338000	2342000	So, you know, it's not like, you know, like you said,
2342000	2345000	I could probably talk to this guy about music, you know?
2345000	2348000	I'm not going to fit in their skinny pants or anything.
2348000	2349000	But, you know...
2349000	2351000	But any time anybody says anything, it's like,
2351000	2353000	nerd used to really mean it was like,
2353000	2354000	fuck that guy, he's a nerd.
2354000	2355000	He's not...
2355000	2356000	No, fuck that guy.
2356000	2358000	He can't come to our party.
2358000	2359000	He's a nerd.
2359000	2360000	Right.
2360000	2362000	And there's a ton of people in this room
2362000	2366000	that truly do not remember that that actually was the case
2366000	2368000	because I was honestly like very...
2368000	2370000	I was totally very young when that changed
2370000	2372000	because of movies like Revenge of the Nerds.
2372000	2374000	It was like, oh, there's this word nerd.
2374000	2376000	Like, okay, now it's funny and interesting.
2376000	2379000	It's like, you can watch movies that predate Revenge of the Nerds.
2379000	2380000	The n-word?
2380000	2382000	There's the n-word, yeah.
2382000	2383000	The...
2383000	2384000	There's movies...
2384000	2385000	I can say nerd.
2385000	2386000	I am one.
2386000	2387000	If you watch...
2387000	2389000	Find a movie called Joysticks,
2389000	2392000	which is like this video game exploitation movie.
2392000	2396000	It predates Revenge of the Nerds and it sort of typifies like...
2396000	2398000	There's other movies like...
2399000	2402000	They're in the 80s but it's before Revenge of the Nerds
2402000	2406000	and it's like there is a character with glasses
2406000	2408000	and a pocket protector in the movie
2408000	2410000	and they do pick on him
2410000	2413000	but the big difference is the guys picking on him are the heroes.
2413000	2416000	Like, and they do just like pick on him
2416000	2418000	and they go like, oh, here comes Stanley.
2418000	2419000	Hey, Stanley.
2419000	2422000	And he's like, guys, I just thought the calculations
2422000	2425000	suggest a different course of action.
2425000	2427000	And they go, yeah, Stanley.
2427000	2429000	Why don't you go in the other room?
2429000	2431000	There's a real hot girl in there.
2431000	2433000	She wants it, Stanley.
2433000	2435000	She really wants it.
2435000	2436000	Oh, come on, guys.
2436000	2440000	Nobody wants it from st-st-Stanley.
2440000	2442000	No, she wants it, Stan.
2442000	2443000	Get in there.
2443000	2445000	But you gotta wear this blindfold, see?
2445000	2447000	Or you won't get all of it.
2447000	2450000	You want to get it all, Stanley.
2450000	2453000	And that's the third act of the movie.
2453000	2455000	It's the resolution.
2455000	2457000	Like, they overcome Stanley.
2457000	2460000	Like, they teach him what a virgin he needs to be
2460000	2462000	by making him fuck a walrus.
2462000	2465000	And they like high five each other in their credits roll.
2465000	2469000	It's like, it's in the way that you fuck with Stanley.
2469000	2472000	Fuck that guy.
2472000	2475000	That's not the plot of Tusk, is it?
2475000	2479000	Revenge of the Nerds came out and I was like, okay, now this word nerd,
2479000	2483000	that was the culture that I was sort of born into.
2484000	2489000	The bottom line is then this word hipster, I've seen the same thing.
2489000	2491000	It's like you go, stand up comics.
2491000	2494000	They go like, oh, these fucking hipsters.
2494000	2496000	They don't, like, what the fuck does it even mean?
2496000	2497000	What's it mean?
2497000	2499000	They mean 25-year-old, kind of.
2499000	2501000	They just, they often mean,
2501000	2505000	I have heard my audience refer to as hipsters and nerds
2505000	2509000	in the same room, like, in two different conversations.
2509000	2511000	A bunch of fucking hipsters showed up.
2511000	2513000	Like, that guy with the leg brace?
2513000	2515000	Well.
2515000	2518000	Yeah, I guess that's hip now, since it's hip to be a nerd.
2518000	2519000	So I guess he's a fucking hipster.
2519000	2521000	Let's beat him up.
2521000	2525000	I used to truly believe that there was,
2525000	2527000	I really recently just changed.
2527000	2530000	I used to think that there really wasn't good and bad
2530000	2533000	and people that I really felt that there was,
2533000	2536000	were all flawed and sometimes we hurt other people
2536000	2538000	and sometimes we act selfishly
2538000	2540000	and then other times we rise above it and we don't.
2540000	2542000	But I truly now believe that that's not true.
2542000	2545000	I really believe there's just good and bad people.
2545000	2546000	Shitty people.
2546000	2549000	And who lack the ability to empathize, you know?
2549000	2552000	So that's who I really don't have any patience for.
2552000	2555000	I would say, some conversation today, I was saying, talking about...
2555000	2557000	By the way, I'm not on grass.
2557000	2559000	I know this is...
2559000	2561000	You keep doing callbacks to this, like,
2561000	2563000	oh, the idea that you're doing little rascals, right?
2563000	2564000	The way I speak, yeah.
2564000	2565000	Yeah, yeah, that's the joke.
2565000	2567000	You're like eight callbacks deep into that,
2567000	2568000	but I think you're,
2568000	2570000	I'm the only one that's noticing those callbacks.
2570000	2572000	That makes me feel like I hurt your feelings when I say that.
2572000	2574000	The sarsaparilla's got me nuts.
2574000	2577000	You said that there were women making big eyes at you.
2577000	2579000	That's it.
2579000	2580000	I don't want to...
2580000	2582000	I feel like, because you...
2582000	2584000	Those were some attractive dames.
2587000	2591000	I behaved correctly because I didn't want it up in the who-scout.
2591000	2593000	The crowbar motel.
2593000	2595000	Yeah, I'm a Damon Runyon character.
2595000	2597000	Were they the bees knees?
2597000	2599000	They were the bees.
2599000	2601000	I was having a conversation.
2601000	2603000	Were you...
2603000	2604000	Was it...
2604000	2605000	Oh, cheese and crackers.
2605000	2607000	Spit it out.
2609000	2611000	I was talking about, like, oh, there's two teams,
2611000	2613000	but then it was like, you know, it's like,
2613000	2615000	damn it, I fucking, I swear to God,
2615000	2616000	I was really eloquent about this today.
2616000	2618000	That's all right.
2618000	2619000	Oh, it was probably with some,
2619000	2621000	one of those two interviewers that I talked to.
2621000	2624000	I talked to a guy from Dorkshelf.
2624000	2625000	And the other guy,
2626000	2628000	what was the other publication?
2628000	2629000	Publication.
2629000	2632000	What was the other fiber optic hologram?
2633000	2635000	Toronto.org, something.
2636000	2638000	I don't know.
2638000	2640000	I said some fucking profound shit.
2640000	2642000	You can read about it in either Dorkshelf
2642000	2648000	or toronto.ew.cwt.ca.org.
2651000	2654000	Very disappointed in your internet, by the way.
2654000	2656000	None of it on your plane.
2656000	2659000	And shitty version in the Hyatt.
2659000	2660000	Couldn't play...
2660000	2661000	You're welcome.
2661000	2662000	Thank you.
2662000	2664000	As long as I get an apology.
2664000	2667000	I've been hearing a lot of shit about American Wi-Fi.
2667000	2669000	I haven't seen...
2669000	2671000	I didn't, like, come here and go,
2671000	2674000	fuck, what the fucking Logan's Run idyllic paradise?
2674000	2676000	Like, they checked into the Hyatt,
2676000	2678000	and they said, oh, it's complimentary Wi-Fi.
2678000	2681000	And I wanted to ask,
2682000	2684000	it's complimentary, does that mean it's slow?
2684000	2686000	And I was like, don't be so American.
2686000	2687000	But they asked.
2687000	2689000	Like, they have socialized medicine here.
2689000	2690000	If you cut your arm off,
2690000	2692000	you're just as entitled to another arm
2692000	2694000	as Bruce Jenner.
2694000	2696000	But they didn't.
2699000	2703000	That's the first, like, richest guy I could think of.
2703000	2704000	Bruce Jenner.
2704000	2705000	Who needs an arm really bad.
2705000	2708000	He's not even a gentleman anymore.
2711000	2714000	No, I'm not being...
2714000	2715000	What?
2715000	2717000	I'm trying to be inclusive.
2717000	2721000	I'm very popular with the transgender community.
2721000	2722000	I am.
2722000	2728000	I did a very pro-transgender video that I was happy.
2728000	2729000	What do you...
2729000	2731000	Explain that.
2731000	2734000	Well, Bruce Jenner is becoming a woman.
2734000	2736000	What?
2742000	2745000	I read it on the teletype.
2750000	2752000	Your mind is blown.
2752000	2753000	Bruce...
2753000	2754000	Yeah.
2754000	2758000	The tone from the Wheaties box is now becoming a woman.
2758000	2760000	And it's so sad, like, at this point in his life,
2760000	2763000	you know, I mean, to waste your whole life not being yourself.
2763000	2765000	Yes.
2765000	2768000	The road comic version of that was going to be,
2768000	2770000	what's the difference?
2770000	2774000	Because it was like, you know, sex equating to sexuality,
2774000	2776000	you know, when you get to a certain...
2776000	2777000	I'm lost.
2777000	2779000	What would Jeff do right now?
2779000	2780000	No, nothing.
2780000	2782000	I was just confessing my own.
2782000	2784000	When you went down that road, I was like,
2784000	2786000	oh, shit, brace yourself for it.
2786000	2789000	Because you said, like, oh, it's such a tragic thing
2789000	2791000	because I filled in the rest of it.
2791000	2792000	What was your zinger?
2792000	2794000	No, it's just like when you're that old,
2794000	2796000	who cares if you're a man or a woman?
2796000	2797000	You're fucking old.
2798000	2801000	It doesn't help to explain it.
2801000	2804000	I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
2804000	2807000	I guess you get that old and you just want to fuck yourself.
2807000	2809000	Maybe that's why he went for it.
2809000	2810000	I don't know.
2810000	2813000	I mean, there's an asexuality to age that I'm very thankful for.
2813000	2815000	I'm 41 and I've finally been released
2815000	2819000	of a certain nine times a day kind of thing.
2819000	2820000	I do.
2820000	2821000	That's what I put a pin in earlier
2821000	2823000	because we were talking about sex and I...
2823000	2824000	Well, I had a...
2824000	2827000	This is a joke from my nightclub act,
2827000	2828000	but it is a true story.
2828000	2830000	So I think that if I say that, it's true.
2830000	2832000	But it's about what you're talking about.
2832000	2835000	And I was in Miami and this young woman said...
2835000	2838000	She said, if you came home with me...
2838000	2839000	She was flirting.
2839000	2841000	She said, if you came home with me, I'd fuck you all night.
2841000	2843000	I'm actually getting quiet telling this story.
2843000	2844000	That's funny.
2844000	2845000	Also, that's not flirting.
2845000	2847000	That gives you an idea how shitty my self-esteem is.
2847000	2848000	What is she trying to say?
2848000	2849000	What is the subtext here?
2850000	2853000	And the idea was I was supposed to go,
2853000	2855000	yeah, but I'm 52.
2855000	2856000	I'll fuck you all night.
2856000	2857000	It's like...
2858000	2860000	That sounds horrible, young lady.
2860000	2862000	How about something for three minutes
2862000	2864000	and then we'll watch Children of Men?
2864000	2866000	You fuck once.
2866000	2869000	Maybe I heard that on demand.
2869000	2871000	Fuck me once, cuddle,
2871000	2873000	and then make me a low sodium breakfast.
2873000	2874000	Then it would be on.
2874000	2877000	Morningstar sausages and omelets
2877000	2880000	made of egg beaters, so...
2880000	2883000	It went off like a light for me.
2883000	2884000	Really?
2884000	2886000	Did you feel a dip?
2886000	2888000	I watched the...
2888000	2889000	I don't really watch them, but...
2889000	2890000	Do you feel...
2890000	2892000	I mean, you just don't have a sex drive anymore?
2892000	2893000	Just not as much as I did.
2893000	2895000	And I'm so grateful for it.
2895000	2896000	I'm so grateful.
2896000	2901000	My next step is I need to channel the much more natural amount
2901000	2903000	of sex drive I have.
2903000	2905000	My mic just drooped.
2905000	2907000	Did you see it?
2907000	2909000	It really did.
2909000	2911000	I guess it's contagious, Dan.
2911000	2913000	I mean, I was a slave to this shit.
2913000	2915000	It was ridiculous.
2915000	2917000	It got in the way of a lot of work.
2917000	2920000	Well, that weird thing of getting a heart on just driving in traffic.
2920000	2921000	Yeah.
2921000	2922000	I'm glad that's gone.
2922000	2923000	I'm so glad that's gone.
2923000	2925000	I'll actually see...
2925000	2928000	I'll be on the sidewalk and I'll look at something
2928000	2934000	and recognize it as something that used to make me have to go back to the...
2934000	2937000	Hotel and deal with it.
2937000	2939000	And I'll go like,
2939000	2942000	I don't smoke anymore.
2942000	2943000	Huh.
2943000	2944000	I'm free.
2944000	2946000	And so I see those Viagra commercials.
2946000	2949000	I'm like, why would you want to go back there?
2949000	2953000	Why don't you just play Minecraft?
2953000	2956000	What are you producing when that's happening?
2956000	2961000	Why are you so excited about wanting to come so bad?
2961000	2962000	Me?
2962000	2963000	No, no.
2963000	2964000	No, not you.
2964000	2968000	I just look at those ads with the guy that goes like,
2968000	2973000	hey, my dick's not so hard anymore all the time.
2973000	2974000	How about you?
2974000	2975000	Don't answer.
2975000	2978000	I've only got 30 seconds to tell you about a new pill.
2978000	2980000	It's going to make your dick constantly hard.
2980000	2982000	Just like when you were at 22.
2982000	2983000	Oh, yeah.
2983000	2987000	I feel your dick get hard with dick hardier.
2987000	2990000	Ask your pharmacist about dick hardier.
2990000	2992000	It's going to make your dick nice and hard.
2992000	2995000	You're not going to be able to control your fucking dick again.
2995000	2999000	It's going to be like in the old days when you had no fucking control over your life.
2999000	3004000	When you got nothing done, you just wanted to rub up against every fucking door jam.
3004000	3009000	When all women were objects, no matter how smart they were,
3009000	3014000	they were reduced to an outfit and a smell.
3014000	3017000	Like, fuck, bring yourself back to that.
3017000	3021000	Don't take the fucking kind embrace of time
3021000	3026000	and its invitation across a threshold into possibly being a human being.
3026000	3028000	Reduce yourself once again.
3028000	3031000	Take Van Wilder pills.
3031000	3033000	Be a douchebag.
3033000	3037000	Walk around with a fucking diamond in your pants.
3037000	3038000	You're 70.
3038000	3040000	Insatiable, unslakeable diamonds.
3040000	3041000	You're 70.
3041000	3044000	It's time to crap out that third family.
3044000	3045000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3045000	3049000	Fuck up your second marriage with new dick pill.
3049000	3051000	Why not?
3051000	3053000	Don't worry about the cost of education.
3053000	3057000	You'll be dead.
3057000	3063000	We could have put this money into making people read more.
3063000	3065000	But your dick will be hard.
3065000	3069000	You die with a hard dick, you old ugly fuck.
3069000	3075000	Now you can use your money and your estate to leverage Starbucks baristas.
3075000	3079000	But what would you do if your drive dipped even more?
3079000	3081000	Well, what do you mean even more?
3081000	3083000	I'd get more done.
3083000	3084000	There's no limit to it.
3084000	3089000	I managed to be able to get things done and rub one out.
3089000	3091000	I still rub one out.
3091000	3094000	My new goal is turning the rubbing out into...
3094000	3097000	I'd like to throw one to Aaron.
3098000	3101000	That's my new... that is my honesty.
3101000	3102000	Me too.
3102000	3105000	Okay, I now...
3107000	3108000	Zling!
3108000	3111000	Snappity-doo!
3111000	3117000	Instead of six times a day having a part of my life that's not shared with other people...
3117000	3120000	But why don't you have a page count?
3120000	3125000	You say after five pages you get to jerk off.
3125000	3126000	What do you mean?
3126000	3129000	When you're writing, isn't that when you're trying to get done?
3129000	3132000	Well, yeah, no, yes, yes.
3132000	3133000	No, that's not a problem anymore.
3133000	3136000	I can write for hours now.
3136000	3139000	Now the problem is that writing is boring.
3139000	3141000	It seems to lack a certain...
3141000	3143000	What do you think's missing from it?
3143000	3144000	I don't know.
3144000	3149000	It's as if the characters want something that they'll never have again.
3149000	3153000	It's as if there's no point to writing anything at all.
3154000	3157000	We've got to climb this pointy monument.
3158000	3163000	It's like there's a bunch of people standing around with no purpose in their lives.
3163000	3167000	Their god has no more reason to animate them because...
3167000	3172000	It's like King of the Hill, just everyone standing there talking about when they had boners as a young man.
3184000	3189000	I'm happy that my sex drive has diminished some, but I don't want it to diminish more.
3189000	3193000	No, I would not want mine to diminish anymore, no.
3193000	3195000	I knew we were going to talk about this tonight.
3195000	3198000	It's like the oil in the menorah lamp.
3198000	3200000	Like now it's like...
3200000	3202000	Yes, now it's magic stuff.
3202000	3204000	It's the miracle.
3204000	3206000	My boner's in the window.
3207000	3216000	Now, in those rare moments, if I pleasure myself, there's a lot of sadness to it.
3216000	3218000	Like extra sadness.
3218000	3221000	Like is it guilt or because you need to go to sleep and not get anything done?
3221000	3225000	No, because I'm like, God damn it, one of these every three days now.
3225000	3227000	I could have given this to Aaron.
3229000	3230000	That's the new sadness.
3230000	3233000	I am so glad you guys are in therapy.
3234000	3237000	That sounds really sad.
3237000	3238000	Well, that's all on me.
3238000	3240000	You go, oh, I wasted a boner.
3240000	3242000	I could have had sex with my fiance.
3242000	3243000	Yeah.
3243000	3245000	Well, because now I know...
3245000	3247000	Because I'm a workaholic.
3247000	3249000	It used to be like...
3249000	3252000	I have a question about your workaholism.
3252000	3254000	No, because...
3254000	3256000	No, I don't get a lot done.
3256000	3257000	Don't ask me that.
3257000	3258000	Don't make me kill myself.
3258000	3263000	No, no, I was really trying to figure out the difference between you and I.
3263000	3265000	Because we're both driven.
3265000	3267000	I mean, I don't think that's a bad thing.
3267000	3268000	We both...
3268000	3271000	After World's Greatest Dad, I wrote 11 screenplays.
3271000	3273000	So I do work.
3273000	3284000	But your form of mental illness is so much more lucrative than mine.
3285000	3287000	I was really brazing myself for something...
3287000	3289000	No, no, because I think it's amazing.
3289000	3291000	I don't understand how you can even...
3291000	3292000	You know, people...
3292000	3295000	You know, the movie and you view you as self-destructive and stuff.
3295000	3299000	But you still can get hired by these people.
3299000	3301000	I mean, I don't try to because I know...
3301000	3302000	That's on them. That's their fault.
3302000	3303000	Right.
3303000	3305000	I do everything I can to be unhireable.
3305000	3307000	I got notes once on one of my movies.
3307000	3310000	And we had a German Shepherd in the editing bay.
3310000	3313000	And I took the notes, put peanut butter on it, gave it to the dog,
3313000	3316000	took a picture of it and sent it to the guy who gave me the notes.
3316000	3319000	That's the only notes I ever got on any of my movies.
3319000	3322000	But then again, most people don't even know I make movies, you know?
3322000	3323000	Well, here's the crazy thing.
3323000	3325000	This is the thing that I don't understand.
3325000	3328000	This is the thing that makes me iconoclastic is that you can do that.
3328000	3329000	You can react that way.
3329000	3332000	Or you can do what I do, which, believe it or not,
3332000	3334000	no one fucking believes it is...
3334000	3338000	And it's in the goddamn movie is I sit there and I go,
3338000	3340000	okay, all right, got it, got it, got it.
3340000	3341000	I write it all down.
3341000	3343000	I address every fucking note.
3343000	3344000	I give it back to him.
3344000	3345000	It doesn't matter.
3345000	3349000	German Shepherd photo, diligence.
3349000	3352000	If you're going to end up with a reputation as being difficult to work with,
3352000	3354000	it's just, I don't know, it's based on something else.
3354000	3358000	Your cheekbones, your body weight, your fucking tone of your voice,
3358000	3360000	your blog where you say you're difficult to work with.
3360000	3361000	I don't know.
3361000	3362000	But don't you...
3362000	3364000	But don't you...
3364000	3367000	When you get notes, aren't you frustrated by that process?
3367000	3370000	I'm not because I don't think the TV is art.
3370000	3372000	I think the TV is commerce.
3372000	3375000	Yeah, but you're clearly passionate about it.
3375000	3376000	I'm very passionate.
3376000	3379000	I want to make the best TV show I possibly can, but I also like...
3379000	3382000	But when these knuckleheads give you notes that are making it...
3382000	3385000	I look at that as like the way that you would look at a paintbrush
3385000	3390000	if it was like, if the paintbrush in your hand argued with you.
3390000	3393000	If you want to be something other than a painter,
3393000	3399000	in this metaphor, painting is just TV, so there's no way to paint without...
3400000	3402000	And so it's just part of the medium.
3402000	3405000	You know, working through knuckleheads.
3405000	3408000	Like, if you're a photographer, you need a camera.
3408000	3413000	You can't just show up at a gallery and say, I saw this homeless lady.
3414000	3415000	And I pictured it in black and black.
3415000	3418000	Well, that is what's going on tonight all around Toronto.
3418000	3419000	It probably is.
3419000	3421000	There's probably something happening.
3421000	3423000	And I support it.
3423000	3425000	I absolutely support it.
3425000	3426000	It's 7 a.m.
3426000	3427000	Tell me about it.
3427000	3428000	She was missing a shoe again.
3428000	3429000	That was fascinating.
3429000	3432000	But when you call it photography, you involve a device
3432000	3433000	and you involve light.
3433000	3434000	It used to be film development.
3434000	3436000	And now it's just whatever ones and zeros.
3436000	3441000	But in any case, there's always a limitation that defines the medium.
3441000	3443000	In television, it's commerce.
3443000	3445000	It's the limitation that defines the medium.
3445000	3447000	You are selling Snickers bars.
3447000	3448000	That is the beauty of it.
3448000	3449000	I grew up.
3449000	3453000	Some of us actually have been on Snickers commercials.
3454000	3456000	The people don't say the F word.
3456000	3460000	They don't rip their tops open and say, look at my giant tits.
3460000	3462000	We'll be right back.
3462000	3464000	Like, that would be cheating.
3464000	3466000	Personally, I think a lot of techniques...
3466000	3468000	That's not in any of my movies.
3468000	3470000	I wasn't talking about you.
3470000	3476000	But I don't know if it's my own fear of being judged on a bigger level or it's not that.
3476000	3481000	It's just I don't have that much interest to play the game.
3481000	3483000	But you don't have to anywhere.
3483000	3486000	The thing about you is that you are a tiny bit older than me.
3486000	3487000	Tiny bit.
3487000	3493000	To the point where you are one of the huge reasons why I moved from Milwaukee to LA.
3493000	3499000	Because I saw you at the Comedy Cafe and you were post Police Academy screeching guy.
3499000	3505000	And you came up and did a set where you were more than willing to do funny jokes that were in your stand-up set.
3505000	3508000	And then sometimes people would yell stuff out and go like, do the voice.
3508000	3511000	And you'd be like, look, hey, what's your name?
3511000	3512000	And you were engaging with them.
3512000	3514000	And then you were just saying insightful things.
3514000	3520000	You bridged the gap between being a professional entertainer and actually being a present human being on stage.
3520000	3526000	And Rob Schwab and I were standing in the back of the room with zits on our faces and lollipops in our hands.
3526000	3528000	And we were like, holy shit.
3528000	3531000	The fucking guy from Police Academy is the bomb.
3531000	3533000	And we talked to you afterwards.
3533000	3537000	We used to say things were the bomb back then.
3537000	3548000	I also had a yin-yang on my acid wash denim jacket and a rat tail because I patterned myself after E-gun from the real Ghostbusters cartoon.
3548000	3551000	And we came up to you afterwards and we were like, holy shit.
3551000	3552000	That was really inspirational.
3552000	3554000	And he said, yeah, what are you guys going to do?
3554000	3555000	And we were like, we're going to move to LA.
3555000	3556000	And you said, don't move to LA.
3556000	3558000	Don't, don't, don't, don't do it.
3558000	3559000	Don't do it.
3559000	3562000	And then we were like, well, that's what he's supposed to say.
3562000	3563000	Well, let's be like him.
3563000	3566000	Let's do what he doesn't think we should do.
3566000	3567000	We moved to LA.
3567000	3570000	Anyways, so I'm telling you, like time has changed.
3570000	3571000	Everything has changed.
3571000	3575000	You need to have a fucking podcast because you make a fucking oomph of movies.
3575000	3579000	And the one thing that they all have in common is your point of view.
3579000	3581000	You should be a cult of personality.
3581000	3584000	You should be having movies made about you.
3584000	3590000	You should be, I'm committing crimes that you could be getting away with very easily.
3590000	3591000	That's really sweet.
3591000	3593000	I didn't let any of it in.
3593000	3601000	But I'm also a little nervous about giving away so much of myself.
3601000	3603000	Don't you, don't you feel that that's, that's weird?
3603000	3607000	Like, don't you ever feel like what you make is what you, you know,
3607000	3609000	I think if you do watch the movies I make,
3609000	3611000	you get a better idea of how I see the world than,
3611000	3613000	than if you hung out with me, maybe.
3613000	3614000	I don't know.
3614000	3616000	I'm very nervous about giving away my, my personal life.
3616000	3619000	Well, that's a huge, I think that is a huge like key.
3619000	3622000	I am not like, I think that's what defines me is like,
3622000	3625000	I'm totally like, once you get to the bottom of the barrel,
3625000	3628000	all you scrape is like, there's nothing there.
3628000	3632000	It's like, oh, this barrel thanks you for being a part of scraping it.
3632000	3636000	Like, I'm not, I think you are a more genuine person than me.
3636000	3639000	I think you actually do have opinions that you wouldn't back off of
3639000	3642000	if a mob of people screamed enough at you.
3642000	3644000	Like, I think you do, I look up to you for that reason.
3644000	3646000	I think you have a voice and a point of view.
3646000	3650000	I think that you're, but that's the stuff that you,
3650000	3651000	you don't give it away by sharing it.
3651000	3655000	You just open a lid on top of it and the wind wafts in.
3655000	3659000	And nowadays, people come in and if they want it, they get it.
3659000	3661000	You can charge them a dollar for it.
3661000	3664000	And if they don't like it, you can tell them to go fuck themselves.
3664000	3665000	It's amazing.
3665000	3668000	It's like, it's not like when we were younger.
3668000	3671000	It's a whole crazy world.
3671000	3674000	It's like, you could, it's like no money down.
3674000	3676000	You could create a whole cult of personality.
3676000	3678000	People could be crucifying you in five years.
3678000	3680000	I think, but I think maybe that's what scares me.
3680000	3684000	I mean, I think, I think, I don't know.
3684000	3689000	My ex-wife said, and by the way, I do love her dearly.
3689000	3691000	It's not like we had a big horrible fallout.
3691000	3694000	She once said to me, she goes, you're a misanthrope.
3694000	3700000	And I said, you're only saying that because you're a person.
3700000	3703000	But I don't see myself as a misanthrope.
3703000	3704000	I just feel really awkward.
3704000	3708000	And, you know, I really related with Spencer when,
3708000	3711000	when, you know, he was awkward by the whole thing.
3711000	3712000	Good segue.
3712000	3714000	Let's bring up Spencer Crittenden.
3727000	3732000	Now I've had some loud applause before, but Jesus Christ.
3732000	3735000	That wasn't an invitation for more.
3739000	3740000	Thank you.
3740000	3743000	Jesus Christ.
3743000	3747000	That was all pent up from the movie, I assume.
3747000	3750000	What's up, you guys?
3750000	3752000	Can I get something off my chest?
3752000	3753000	Yeah.
3753000	3754000	I'm a nerd.
3754000	3755000	Yeah.
3755000	3759000	And I'm fucking sick of all these jocks acting like nerds.
3759000	3761000	No, but okay.
3761000	3763000	I don't actually take a lot of shit from being a nerd.
3763000	3767000	So I've said that before, but I didn't mean it.
3767000	3772000	But here's the thing about social groups from nerds to jocks to everything.
3772000	3775000	It's all about excluding other people.
3775000	3779000	Like if you're a group, you're only a group because you're not that group.
3779000	3780000	You're this group.
3780000	3783000	So you have to single people out and ridicule them.
3783000	3786000	Otherwise you're just a huge, you know, non-group.
3786000	3787000	Right.
3787000	3794000	And so in high school, when, when I was a genuine bonafide nerd and punished for it,
3794000	3796000	I would end choosing it.
3796000	3801000	I would, I would, I would, I would report dutifully to a living room full of other nerds
3801000	3802000	and play Dungeons and Dragons.
3802000	3806000	And we would talk shit about fucking jocks because they weren't allowed.
3806000	3809000	And if one of them had showed up, we would have treated them like shit.
3809000	3813000	So, I mean, you know, it's just, I don't think it's a good part of nerd culture,
3813000	3816000	but I think that's more humanity than anything else.
3816000	3818000	It's just, we gotta, we gotta get cred.
3818000	3821000	We gotta kick other people out so we can be in.
3821000	3825000	When I was in high school, I was actually friends with all the other groups.
3825000	3826000	Me too.
3826000	3834000	But I didn't consider them, look, I hated myself way more than anybody else is gonna.
3834000	3837000	So I didn't care what they thought of me.
3837000	3838000	Yeah.
3838000	3840000	I kind of was more like that too.
3840000	3843000	And because of that, everyone liked me and I was like, well, this works.
3843000	3846000	But then I only care.
3846000	3849000	I was the biggest Jim Carrey fucking whore.
3849000	3852000	Like I only cared if people like me and I would go,
3852000	3855000	I would do anything for a fucking social dollar.
3855000	3856000	And they didn't like you, right?
3856000	3857000	No, they did.
3857000	3858000	It worked.
3858000	3859000	It worked.
3859000	3860000	It's a thing.
3860000	3862000	It's like, there's no wrong answers necessarily.
3862000	3867000	It was like, I was a nerd for how much I wanted people to like me.
3867000	3872000	And I was like, like, you know, just clawing my way up.
3872000	3875000	Well, I was doing stand up when I was like 16.
3875000	3877000	So it was weird.
3877000	3880000	I didn't care about all the stuff everybody else cared about.
3880000	3884000	It was like they were worried about prom and I was trying to get a tight 20
3884000	3885000	together.
3885000	3888000	Seriously, I was just a weirdo that way.
3888000	3892000	But I also feel really embarrassed to admit this publicly.
3892000	3895000	I don't, this may be an exclusive.
3895000	3898000	I was homecoming king.
3898000	3900000	I was senior class vice president.
3900000	3903000	I thought it was just like as a joke, you know what I mean?
3903000	3906000	No, I mean, it probably wasn't half like, I mean, it was like,
3907000	3912000	like a lot of the nerds I talked to that were like performance oriented by their senior
3912000	3918000	year, they had worked their way up to like, I am the clown prince of nerdness.
3918000	3921000	And it was like, you blurred the line between nerd.
3921000	3927000	I was like, people really like you, we used the word popularity when I was a kid.
3927000	3929000	I don't even know if that means anything anymore.
3929000	3933000	I know that everyone's connected to their phones and shit, but yeah, it still means
3933000	3936000	popularity was like a thing.
3936000	3937000	It still is.
3937000	3938000	Knowing who you were.
3938000	3945000	When Tom Kenny and I, Tom Kenny, you guys know him as Spongebob and all those other
3945000	3946000	stuff.
3946000	3947000	And Ice King on Adventure Time.
3947000	3949000	He's the Ice King on Adventure Time.
3949000	3950000	That's the crowd.
3950000	3951000	Yeah.
3951000	3952000	Yeah.
3952000	3954000	That's the only time I ever asked him if I could be on one of the shows he works on,
3954000	3956000	actually, because I love that show so much.
3956000	3959000	And I've known him since I was six years old.
3959000	3960000	We've been friends our whole lives.
3960000	3965000	And in second grade, they were picking teams for dodgeball.
3965000	3967000	And there was three people left.
3967000	3972000	It was he, I, and this girl who had two hooks for arms.
3972000	3975000	It's a true story.
3975000	3979000	And we were recently talking about it.
3979000	3985000	And he said, that was the day I knew I'd never be good at sports.
3985000	3989000	And the way my ego worked, I actually thought, oh, they didn't pick us because they
3989000	3993000	knew we can handle it.
3993000	3996000	So I've always had this huge amount of self-esteem and self-loathing all at the same
3996000	3997000	time.
3997000	4001000	You're able to just say, yeah, in a moment, you can emergency bilge.
4001000	4002000	Yeah.
4002000	4003000	Yeah, I just thought, yeah.
4003000	4004000	I just shut so much.
4004000	4006000	By the way, she got picked before us.
4006000	4007000	Yeah.
4007000	4008000	That's the tag.
4008000	4009000	I hope she was great.
4009000	4011000	Well, she's a ringer in the dodgeball game.
4011000	4012000	She had two hooks.
4012000	4015000	Yeah, she just pops them and they stick to her hook.
4015000	4017000	Those are the days when I discovered a disability.
4017000	4018000	You didn't hit me.
4018000	4019000	I caught it.
4019000	4020000	It counts.
4020000	4021000	Yeah, it's fine.
4021000	4022000	You're out now.
4022000	4023000	Sorry, Dan.
4023000	4024000	What were you saying?
4024000	4029000	I actually thought, I mean, my way of coping with it wasn't to think, like, create that
4029000	4030000	mythology in my head.
4030000	4036000	I would just, I just found out, oh, there's a wire that all this pain comes through.
4036000	4040000	I thought you were going to get up and kick my ass.
4040000	4043000	Here's some pain coming through.
4043000	4047000	You cut out my best parts in the movie.
4047000	4052000	The movie only had my best parts.
4052000	4057000	Like, there's literally not another scene of me being funny in any of those 600 hours
4057000	4058000	of footage.
4058000	4059000	It's amazing.
4059000	4060000	Cha-ching.
4060000	4061000	Yeah.
4061000	4062000	No, you're telling me.
4062000	4063000	You heard that applause.
4063000	4064000	That's not...
4064000	4065000	Thank you.
4065000	4068000	That's very kind.
4068000	4074000	Anyways, I don't know why I have to follow this thought.
4075000	4080000	I followed the cord with the paint on it, and I found that it plugs into part of your heart,
4080000	4083000	and you can pull it.
4083000	4084000	The paint cord.
4084000	4085000	Yeah.
4085000	4088000	And you don't feel anything anymore.
4088000	4089000	And you don't...
4089000	4092000	You can actually be really mean to people.
4092000	4093000	And you don't...
4093000	4097000	There's no empathy anymore, so you could squeeze someone's head.
4097000	4101000	You run into the Game of Thrones when the Game of Thrones...
4101000	4102000	What about 70?
4102000	4103000	That was the end of it?
4103000	4107000	When the guy puts the thumbs through the eyeballs.
4107000	4110000	It's like, man, you know the only thing that keeps...
4110000	4112000	Isn't it funny to realize that?
4112000	4113000	The only thing...
4113000	4115000	Human beings have these eyeballs.
4115000	4121000	If you're in a fight, if you're a feral human, I guess you'd probably scratch for it.
4121000	4123000	I'm like, I'm gonna scratch your eyes out.
4123000	4131000	But truly, if you get in a fight, the only thing that keeps you from actually actively
4131000	4134000	just doing everything you can to this...
4134000	4140000	These little soft grapes that represent 90% of the person's ability to function...
4140000	4142000	Camels made of jelly.
4142000	4143000	That's what they are.
4143000	4150000	The only thing that keeps you from really getting in there is actual empathy.
4150000	4152000	That's why when in a movie somebody goes like...
4152000	4156000	It represents that person not giving a fuck.
4156000	4158000	And you go like, what the fuck is he...
4158000	4159000	What is he doing?
4159000	4160000	Oh my God!
4160000	4165000	But you're like, well, if you wanted to win a fight, I guess that's how you do it.
4165000	4167000	That's what chimps do.
4167000	4171000	Yeah, they go for the fucking face and the genitals and the hands.
4171000	4172000	A buddy of mine...
4172000	4174000	Everything that makes you a chimp.
4174000	4181000	A buddy of mine was in Georgia, and they had a thing when he was growing up at the fair,
4181000	4186000	and it was monkey boxing or chimp boxing.
4186000	4189000	And so this guy's like, I'm gonna go in there.
4189000	4194000	It was $5,000 to last two minutes in the cage.
4194000	4197000	I go in there, I get my mama, get my mama a trailer.
4197000	4198000	Come on!
4198000	4200000	My friend George, he worked at Cartoon Network.
4200000	4201000	What was the price?
4201000	4203000	Five grand if you last two minutes.
4203000	4204000	You could buy a trailer.
4204000	4206000	So he goes in...
4206000	4209000	I'm gonna get my mama a trailer?
4209000	4210000	It's not even a chimp.
4210000	4212000	It's an orangutan.
4212000	4213000	Oh no!
4213000	4214000	They're worse out here.
4214000	4215000	They got longer reaches.
4216000	4218000	The painting was very misleading.
4218000	4223000	He had them proper old-time boxing wear gloves.
4223000	4226000	He's got an Irish handlebar mustache.
4226000	4231000	I heard Joe wanted to have a bit of a roundabout with me.
4231000	4234000	Queensberry rules, will it be then?
4235000	4237000	One banana for the winner.
4239000	4240000	And there's no ring.
4240000	4244000	There's a ring on the poster, and they get in there, and it's just a cage.
4244000	4249000	And they put a ring through the bars of the cage.
4249000	4252000	And he says the orangutan's got boxing gloves on.
4252000	4253000	He's just sitting there.
4253000	4256000	And the guy goes, I'll just rope-a-dope him.
4256000	4260000	He's got the arm length, so if I get in tight, he's got his whole strategy.
4260000	4261000	I'll just get in tight.
4261000	4262000	Not rope-a-doping.
4262000	4263000	Yeah.
4263000	4265000	So he's gotta get in there tight.
4265000	4266000	I already doesn't know what rope-a-doping is.
4266000	4267000	I know that.
4267000	4268000	So he's doomed.
4268000	4271000	So he gets in there, and they go, ding!
4271000	4275000	So you didn't even see the ring of Tang just shot across the cage,
4275000	4279000	wrapped his legs around the guy, bit him in the face, and pissed all over him.
4281000	4282000	He's like, ah!
4284000	4286000	Are you fucking kidding me?
4286000	4287000	You weren't there?
4287000	4289000	No, no, no, my friend George tells this story.
4289000	4291000	But I do believe it's a true story.
4291000	4294000	Well, when you box, don't you usually wear a mouth guard?
4297000	4299000	That's why you're calling bullshit on this story.
4299000	4300000	I don't buy that.
4300000	4302000	Yes, the orangutan cheated.
4302000	4305000	I don't think this orangutan was not playing, but I'm sanctioning rules.
4305000	4307000	They could definitely get those gloves on,
4307000	4311000	but I wouldn't trust anyone to go in your orangutan mouth.
4311000	4312000	Well...
4312000	4316000	Anyways, what I'm saying is, the reason we don't do that to each other when we get to a fight...
4316000	4317000	Is because that's the...
4317000	4318000	We love each other.
4318000	4320000	At the end of the day?
4320000	4324000	At the end of the day, when we look at each other, we see each other.
4324000	4326000	And chimpanzees and orangutans, when they look at each other,
4326000	4330000	they see a genetic rival.
4330000	4335000	And they're like, if I take that guy out, the thing that keeps them in line is fear.
4335000	4337000	They exist in these communities.
4337000	4339000	And we're no strangers to this.
4339000	4342000	We are 99% their cousins.
4342000	4344000	But the thing that makes us different,
4344000	4348000	and the thing that ironically made us be the people with the nuclear weapons,
4348000	4353000	and the tires, and the fire, and the lasers, and the GPS, is compassion.
4354000	4357000	And I'm not saying that makes us good people,
4357000	4360000	but it's like an evolutionary step that we took.
4360000	4364000	That's my two cents as an anthropologist.
4364000	4366000	But you don't think that's all fear-based?
4366000	4368000	You think that's compassion-based?
4368000	4374000	I think it's like we became a kind of weird combination of primate and pack animal.
4374000	4379000	Like we chose, or when I say chose, I mean in quotes,
4379000	4386000	because evolution preferred an instinct for altruism.
4386000	4390000	What we call, oh, cool.
4390000	4393000	That was nice of him. He didn't have to do that.
4393000	4396000	We exude that.
4396000	4401000	We notice when it's not happening, we notice that it's not happening all the time.
4401000	4406000	But the fact is, we have it in spades over giraffes and chimpanzees.
4406000	4409000	We are ridiculous about it.
4409000	4412000	We will take bullets for each other without thinking about it.
4412000	4415000	We don't always do it. You can't predict it.
4415000	4421000	But we do have more of a propensity for sacrifice
4421000	4424000	in the face of another human being suffering.
4424000	4425000	We will go, that's not fair.
4425000	4427000	Hey, what's going on over here?
4427000	4429000	Stop picking on that guy.
4429000	4433000	Even if it doesn't profit us, even if it puts us at risk,
4433000	4437000	before we even know what we're doing, we kind of go, whoa, whoa, whoa.
4437000	4440000	What are you doing? That's my theory.
4440000	4442000	None of this is based on science.
4442000	4446000	It's based on the three documentaries I've seen and what I choose to believe.
4446000	4452000	What you're describing is our sharp teeth or our scorpion sting or our hard armor.
4452000	4456000	That's what we've evolved, is this really intense pack.
4456000	4458000	We're jingoists.
4458000	4461000	Yeah, but it's kind of the group mentality thing I was talking about with nerds.
4461000	4464000	That's what we evolved, and that's why we go to war.
4464000	4468000	It's because we can get together a band and go beat the shit out of a rhino.
4468000	4469000	That's what works.
4469000	4475000	When you watch the 300 and you see that idea of a small football team of guys going,
4482000	4485000	that's how we kind of feel in general.
4485000	4492000	We default to that weird, we don't just fucking run.
4492000	4496000	I see that kind of behavior more not about protecting the little guy,
4496000	4500000	but more about being afraid that someone's going to take their stuff away.
4500000	4503000	I think it's both of it.
4503000	4506000	That's the weird twisted path that we've taken,
4506000	4509000	is that we protect ourselves through that instinct.
4509000	4512000	I don't think that God is moving through us,
4512000	4515000	and therefore we're really cool to each other.
4515000	4518000	I think that our species is seven billion strong
4518000	4522000	because we at some point figured out the cheat code of,
4522000	4525000	how's my neighbor doing?
4525000	4529000	We are the descendants genetically of the primates
4529000	4532000	that acted more on that impulse than others.
4532000	4538000	It worked out for our species just because it caused giant communities.
4538000	4541000	You're much more hopeful than I am.
4541000	4543000	Well, it's not getting us anywhere.
4543000	4546000	We're all going to die together like a bunch of altruistic assholes.
4546000	4548000	But we're going to die after the dodo dead.
4548000	4551000	Fuck the dodo, that's the key.
4551000	4556000	Fucking dodo can take a flying fuck at a rolling version of itself.
4556000	4559000	Maybe the dodo is the asshole.
4559000	4562000	I'll tell you the biggest asshole in the world, giraffes.
4562000	4563000	Fuck giraffes.
4563000	4564000	Really?
4564000	4566000	Fucking long neck horse.
4566000	4567000	That's bullshit.
4567000	4570000	No, but it's the dolphins.
4570000	4573000	They're the rapists of the sea.
4573000	4576000	We always come back to dolphins being terrible people.
4576000	4579000	Well, because people love dolphins, and they're sketchy.
4579000	4582000	We love dolphins as a species, but then it turns out,
4582000	4586000	apparently now the new development is that when you look at dolphins,
4586000	4590000	if you get past the fourth wall of dolphins, it turns out they're sexist.
4590000	4591000	Which I love.
4591000	4593000	A dolphin will fuck you up.
4593000	4596000	If you're a shark, that's for sure. That's all I know.
4596000	4598000	Or if you're a woman.
4598000	4599000	A woman dolphin.
4599000	4602000	And if you're a female shark, oh my god.
4602000	4605000	Oh my god. They must be like, payday.
4605000	4610000	But I saw a video really recently about a dolphin playing with a cat.
4610000	4612000	It was the most cutest thing in the world.
4612000	4615000	The dolphin would use its snout and tap the cat on the head,
4615000	4619000	and then the cat would touch its paw to the snout,
4619000	4621000	and they'd go back and forth for two and a half minutes.
4621000	4622000	It was adorable.
4622000	4624000	Yeah, that's the edited version.
4625000	4628000	That was before the cat was mercilessly slaughtered.
4628000	4629000	It'd be great to...
4629000	4630000	They're smart.
4630000	4634000	As soon as that prick drops that iPhone, I am fucking up that cat.
4634000	4639000	If you're listening, I don't suppose there's a lot of dolphin experts in Toronto,
4639000	4642000	but if you are listening out there,
4642000	4645000	like please come to the nearest Harman Town City.
4645000	4647000	It's a dolphin experience.
4647000	4648000	We really want to hear more about...
4648000	4652000	We want to get to the bottom of where dolphins are good people or bad people.
4652000	4655000	Because I really want to know, because you hear these stories of people are drowning
4655000	4657000	and then the dolphins save them,
4657000	4659000	and then you hear other stories that are like,
4659000	4663000	no, they actually actively drown the people because they're sociopaths.
4663000	4665000	And then you think, well, that's like humans too.
4665000	4667000	You could run across the wrong kind of humans.
4667000	4668000	Right.
4668000	4670000	And whenever anyone uses that about an animal,
4670000	4672000	they're more frightened of you than you are of them.
4672000	4674000	You're like, well, how do I know this isn't the crazy bear?
4674000	4675000	Yeah.
4675000	4677000	You know what I mean?
4677000	4680000	There's just like 12 really sexist dolphins
4680000	4682000	that are giving everyone the wrong impression.
4682000	4683000	Yeah.
4683000	4685000	That's why they tell you to play dead with a bear
4685000	4686000	until they start eating you.
4686000	4687000	Yeah.
4687000	4689000	That was always my fear.
4689000	4690000	It's like, why do you play dead?
4690000	4692000	They're just going to eat you that you're dead.
4692000	4693000	Right.
4693000	4694000	I don't know if I grammar that right.
4694000	4695000	I think some of the bears are like,
4695000	4698000	you're supposed to play dead because some of the bears don't want to eat you.
4698000	4700000	They want you to stop attacking their cubs.
4700000	4701000	Yeah.
4701000	4703000	So they swipe at you and then you're supposed to go,
4703000	4704000	oh, good job. I'm dead.
4704000	4705000	See you later.
4705000	4707000	Good luck on your bear business.
4707000	4709000	That guy was a hell of a bastard.
4709000	4713000	I can't kill him. He's a great thespian.
4713000	4717000	Bears are like, they're huge theater fans.
4717000	4718000	You guys are in Toronto.
4718000	4722000	You probably have bears like walking down the street, right?
4722000	4724000	They're like, you know, bears.
4724000	4726000	Someone said gay.
4726000	4728000	Did they mean like the gay bears?
4728000	4730000	Oh, gay bears. Okay.
4730000	4731000	I thought you meant it was gay,
4731000	4734000	the idea that wildlife was part of your society.
4734000	4738000	That's so gay to have a bear walking down the street.
4738000	4740000	Where's the otter?
4740000	4742000	Get real. That's gay.
4742000	4748000	They're like, you know, bears at the dump are like bikers.
4748000	4753000	You know, you just stay in your car and keep the doors locked.
4753000	4755000	Did you ever go to the dump to look at bears?
4755000	4757000	I never went to the dump to look at bears.
4757000	4761000	All right. A couple of moves from people.
4761000	4763000	You guys got a bear dump in Toronto?
4763000	4765000	Pack eagle.
4765000	4766000	Pack eagle?
4766000	4768000	It's an excellent bear dump.
4768000	4771000	Is that the lover's lane?
4771000	4774000	Sometimes when we weren't listening to the radio programs,
4774000	4777000	we'd go out to the dump.
4777000	4780000	I'm just picturing all these discarded bears.
4780000	4786000	I never understood that.
4786000	4788000	It's the land of misfit toys.
4788000	4790000	I guess I do get it.
4790000	4792000	I'm a bear with no teeth.
4792000	4795000	But didn't that always confuse you when people would say like,
4795000	4800000	oh, don't feed the, the trouble is people feed the animal in question.
4800000	4803000	Like usually it's bears, but they say the same thing about mountain lions
4803000	4805000	or whatever they go.
4805000	4809000	The danger is when they associate humans with food.
4809000	4811000	And you're like, oh, got it.
4811000	4813000	Wait, what? No.
4813000	4815000	What? What?
4815000	4817000	Because that's how you train a dog.
4817000	4821000	Well, I think you might be misunderstanding what they're saying.
4821000	4824000	The associating with you with food is now every,
4824000	4826000	every person I see is going to give me food.
4826000	4828000	So I'm going to come up to them and bother them.
4828000	4830000	And then the person gives them a peanut.
4830000	4831000	Or it doesn't.
4831000	4833000	And then they, you know, if it's a coyote, they bark.
4833000	4835000	And you know, that's scary for the person.
4835000	4837000	Like you don't want them approaching you
4837000	4841000	because then someone could freak out and stab it in the face or something.
4841000	4842000	All right.
4842000	4843000	So the reason.
4843000	4847000	So the reason to not feed coyotes is because coyotes will get stabbed
4847000	4849000	in the face by someone without food.
4849000	4851000	Yeah. You know about coyote hazing?
4851000	4852000	A coyote hazing.
4852000	4854000	Yeah. It's really rampant in colleges.
4854000	4856000	It's a shame.
4856000	4859000	I can't, I can't, if I can't have an honest conversation with you.
4859000	4860000	No. Okay. Coyote hazing.
4860000	4863000	What, what, what the intent, you know, and I don't know,
4863000	4865000	everyone knows I'm a huge coyote expert.
4865000	4870000	But, uh, what up, cash fans?
4870000	4872000	Yeah. I love that applause.
4872000	4875000	Spencer has a, Spencer, can I explain to Bob?
4875000	4877000	I'd love it if you did.
4877000	4884000	Spencer, Spencer, Spencer hears about coyote activity sometimes in Los Angeles.
4884000	4890000	Spencer has in his head, he imagines that if he ever gets attacked by a gang of coyotes.
4890000	4892000	I don't, I didn't put it that way.
4892000	4897000	I was in a virtual reality setting where dangerous coyotes are definitely going to attack you
4897000	4899000	until one of you guys is dead.
4899000	4906000	Spencer believes that he knows how to fight a pack of coyote effectively.
4906000	4908000	Four to five. I'm a dope pack.
4908000	4909000	No, no.
4909000	4910000	Not rope a dope.
4910000	4911000	Nope.
4911000	4913000	It's a circular kicking technique.
4913000	4919000	I mean, this, I mean, I feel like Toronto has earned, has earned a demonstration.
4919000	4922000	I don't want to, I don't want to pimp you or anything.
4922000	4925000	I, I guess I'm going to have to do it.
4925000	4927000	I mean, you have to now.
4927000	4932000	I mean this, when you lean, when you lean forward in your chair, this whole stage shook.
4932000	4934000	So, I don't know.
4934000	4935000	I don't know.
4935000	4936000	I'm going to, I'm going to move.
4936000	4937000	It just, it just, just don't do it.
4937000	4941000	At least segue me back into coyote hazing because I really want to get to the bottom of this.
4941000	4945000	Just do, just do a quiet Canadian version of the coyote defense technique.
4945000	4949000	That's just going to look like it.
4949000	4950000	How do you, just for Bob.
4950000	4952000	What do you mean quiet?
4952000	4955000	So, so there's five coyotes all around you.
4955000	4956000	Yeah.
4956000	4972000	And it's just, you don't, you don't keep your back exposed for long.
4972000	4975000	You keep your back moving so they can't go at your knees.
4975000	4978000	I thought it was going to be more of a sweep kick, but it was more.
4978000	4980000	No, you can't sweep a four legged animal.
4980000	4982000	That's your first mistake.
4982000	4984000	That would be my first mistake.
4984000	4985000	Yeah.
4985000	4987000	They got way more balance than us.
4987000	4989000	That's why we use chairs with four legs.
4989000	4992000	He was definitely taking it easy because you're nervous about these risers.
4992000	4993000	I mean, you felt that, right?
4993000	4994000	Yeah.
4994000	4995000	Yeah.
4995000	4996000	They sweat.
4996000	4997000	Yeah.
4997000	4999000	So, so you, but you obviously care about coyotes.
4999000	5000000	Yeah.
5000000	5002000	I think they're, they're mean from his tender kicks.
5002000	5003000	Well, yeah.
5003000	5005000	He wants them to live to tell the tale.
5005000	5012000	My coyote defense, if we're just fantasizing, involves a firearm.
5012000	5013000	Yeah.
5013000	5015000	This is an unarmed, this is an unarmed scenario.
5015000	5019000	If I had, you know, even just a backpack, my tactics would differ greatly.
5019000	5021000	Of course.
5021000	5023000	What would it look like if you had a backpack?
5023000	5024000	Something like this.
5024000	5026000	Spin around backwards while swinging a backpack.
5026000	5027000	All right. Okay.
5027000	5028000	Pishaw.
5028000	5029000	But yeah, you know.
5029000	5032000	One would tackle you, the other eat your Lunchables.
5032000	5033000	It's important.
5033000	5035000	Well, you distract them with the Lunchables.
5035000	5036000	You distract them with the Lunchables.
5036000	5038000	Now, um, I love coyotes though.
5038000	5039000	I actually do.
5039000	5042000	I, I do like coyotes.
5042000	5043000	They're gorgeous.
5043000	5048000	But they're also, you know, they killed, they killed my dog, Sid Vicious.
5048000	5049000	I had a Yorkie.
5049000	5051000	I feel bad about that, but that's the animal kingdom.
5051000	5052000	Animals kill.
5052000	5053000	And it's terrible.
5053000	5054000	I know.
5054000	5055000	It's terrible.
5055000	5057000	And, and their defense, Sid was delicious.
5057000	5059000	No, no, but yeah.
5059000	5060000	So I feel really weird.
5060000	5062000	You know, I actually went out with a chair.
5062000	5065000	I didn't have a backpack and didn't think about kicking.
5066000	5068000	The kicking's the last resort.
5068000	5069000	I did.
5069000	5073000	But I, I, I scared the coyote off of Jimmy Stewart and Andy Dufresne.
5073000	5074000	The other two dogs.
5074000	5076000	Oh, did you save your other two dogs?
5076000	5077000	Yeah.
5077000	5080000	Yeah. I mean, in Los Angeles, I don't know if the Toronto has an equivalent,
5080000	5086000	but Los Angeles, it's like, it's crazy to me because like wildlife is,
5086000	5087000	it astounds me.
5087000	5091000	The fact that there's raccoons astounds me because everywhere you look,
5091000	5092000	there's just city.
5092000	5096000	And then there's this whole population of like mountain lions and, and,
5096000	5099000	and I don't know where they come from or where they could possibly live,
5099000	5103000	but yes, I understand that there's probably mountains involved.
5103000	5104000	Thank you.
5105000	5108000	Griffith park is probably where they live, but it's just like, like,
5108000	5109000	like there's kind of,
5109000	5113000	sometimes you'll see like a kind of dazed coyote like,
5113000	5116000	like walking down the sidewalk in Los Feliz.
5116000	5118000	And it's like, holy shit.
5118000	5123000	It's like a dog, but it ain't a dog that could eat another dog.
5123000	5124000	Yeah. You got to haze them.
5124000	5126000	That's why whenever I see him driving around,
5126000	5129000	I like honk my horn and I shine my lights at him and I go at him like,
5129000	5131000	I'm going to hit him with my car.
5132000	5133000	Coyote hazing people.
5133000	5135000	Look it up. Let me talk about coyote hazing.
5135000	5138000	And the alternative though, is that you're one of these people that's like,
5138000	5140000	your dog is gone.
5140000	5142000	That's why you do it because like we were saying,
5142000	5145000	if you feed a coyote, they'll be like, oh man, humans are cool.
5145000	5147000	I can go in their backyard and whatever.
5147000	5150000	You know, they think you're like a cool, they think humans aren't dangerous
5150000	5153000	and they need to think humans are dangerous so they're not comfortable around them
5153000	5155000	because when they're comfortable around, they're animals.
5155000	5157000	All right. Well, bears don't need to.
5157000	5159000	No, you should do it to a lot of wildlife.
5159000	5163000	Like they suggest you, anytime you see a squirrel,
5163000	5166000	no, but they say throw rocks at bears and make yourself as big as possible.
5166000	5167000	It's the same thing.
5167000	5168000	They want you to be,
5168000	5172000	they want you to make animals uncomfortable around you.
5172000	5174000	We saw, we saw,
5174000	5179000	we saw two mountain lions when we were making the Bigfoot movie I made.
5179000	5180000	Yeah.
5180000	5181000	And well, thank you.
5181000	5184000	You mean Willow Creek, which is available in all the...
5184000	5185000	On digital platforms.
5185000	5187000	...on demand and cultural.
5187000	5191000	And it was terrifying, you know.
5191000	5193000	So...
5193000	5195000	What do they look like when you see them in the wild?
5195000	5198000	Because in the movies, they're always crouching on a rock.
5198000	5200000	It was way scarier.
5200000	5202000	It was like standing up there really tall.
5202000	5205000	It was just walking casual, like what up, you know.
5205000	5207000	It was really intimidating.
5207000	5209000	And then it was a scene.
5209000	5212000	There's a scene in the tent that's really long and scary.
5212000	5216000	And we filmed that about at 2 a.m. after we'd seen a mountain lion.
5216000	5219000	And the actor Bryce Johnson, this is a long take,
5219000	5221000	and his character started crying.
5221000	5222000	And I said, that was really good, Bryce,
5222000	5224000	but I just don't think your character would cry in the scene.
5224000	5227000	He goes, I'm not crying.
5227000	5229000	He's like, the character's not crying.
5229000	5230000	I am crying.
5230000	5233000	Why are we filming this out in the woods at 3 a.m.?
5233000	5236000	We could be in a hotel parking lot.
5236000	5240000	And so we were hanging around with the ranger,
5240000	5245000	who is a Bigfoot enthusiast.
5245000	5247000	And so I was sitting close to Ranger Robert
5247000	5251000	because I figured he could protect me from a mountain lion.
5251000	5255000	And he said, he goes, you know, I'm a writer too.
5255000	5257000	And I go, oh, what are you writing?
5257000	5258000	He goes, you know Twilight?
5258000	5260000	I go, yeah, I don't know Twilight.
5260000	5263000	And he goes, well, I write coming of age stories
5263000	5268000	set in the Bigfoot community like Twilight.
5268000	5273000	And I said, what's the name of your book?
5273000	5275000	He goes, the first one was Yeti or Not.
5275000	5279000	And I know you think I'm setting up for a joke,
5279000	5281000	but it's available on eBay.
5281000	5283000	You can get Yeti or Not.
5283000	5285000	What was the second one?
5285000	5289000	What was the second one?
5289000	5291000	I didn't ask for the second one.
5291000	5292000	Sasquatch and Learn.
5292000	5294000	You know what they say about boys with big feet?
5294000	5299000	No.
5299000	5300000	Yeah.
5300000	5302000	Good times.
5302000	5304000	It's tough because, yeah, the Bigfoot,
5304000	5307000	it doesn't work as well with the adolescent Judy Blume
5307000	5308000	kind of culture.
5308000	5311000	Hello, God, it's me, Bigfoot.
5311000	5313000	Hello, God, it's me, Sasquatch.
5313000	5316000	I once, for about an evening,
5316000	5319000	thought it would be funny to make that a movie.
5319000	5321000	And then I went out and bought it,
5321000	5323000	and I was like, nobody would be, you know.
5323000	5326000	It all started because someone said,
5326000	5327000	what are you doing next?
5327000	5333000	I said, I'm doing a period piece.
5333000	5334000	Puns.
5334000	5335000	Ah, puns.
5335000	5336000	Puns.
5336000	5340000	That's how today started, about how much we hated puns.
5340000	5343000	I think it's funny, though, that your life was in the hands
5343000	5347000	of a guy that then was like, I'm a writer.
5347000	5349000	Did that make you feel less safe?
5349000	5350000	Totally.
5350000	5352000	It's like, stand back.
5352000	5353000	He's got an idea.
5353000	5357000	You want a guy that's like, no, I definitely
5357000	5360000	am totally enthused about the idea of physical conflict
5360000	5362000	with nature, not a guy that's like, you know,
5362000	5364000	I could have done Buffy.
5364000	5367000	I'm doing this in the meantime.
5367000	5368000	Stand back.
5368000	5369000	Stand back.
5369000	5371000	I've got a strong second act.
5371000	5375000	But also, it's like you being able to resonate with that guy
5375000	5379000	makes you, as a bodyguard, when it comes to a bodyguard,
5379000	5384000	the quality I want most is not being able to understand
5384000	5385000	what he's thinking.
5385000	5386000	Yeah.
5386000	5388000	If I were to hire a bodyguard, I'd be like,
5388000	5390000	oh, you're a giant slab of meat.
5390000	5392000	Me, back at me.
5392000	5395000	Yeah, I was definitely the alpha male at that moment.
5395000	5396000	Yeah.
5396000	5398000	I've got a screenplay.
5398000	5400000	Oh, boy.
5400000	5402000	I don't know how much time we've burned.
5402000	5403000	I don't know how Toronto's time works.
5403000	5408000	I heard your minutes are one minute and three seconds long.
5408000	5411000	Your beer's a little stronger, and your minutes
5411000	5412000	are a little longer.
5412000	5414000	These days, they're 57 minutes, I'm told.
5414000	5415000	Oh.
5415000	5417000	Oh, that's probably America's fault.
5417000	5420000	We probably did too much fracking.
5420000	5421000	Sorry about that.
5421000	5425000	We had to, we drank your milkshake a little bit.
5425000	5431000	We heard there's some time up here we could use to power our cars.
5431000	5433000	But yeah, I don't know how long we've gone,
5433000	5437000	but I know that we should meet some friends and play some D&D
5437000	5439000	in that order.
5443000	5448000	Now, I know that we do have some friends that came here.
5448000	5450000	I know Jan's here.
5450000	5451000	Jane.
5451000	5452000	Earthshine Jane.
5452000	5453000	It's Jane.
5453000	5454000	It's just spelled weird.
5454000	5455000	Jane.
5455000	5456000	No offense, Jane.
5456000	5458000	Jesus, Jane.
5458000	5459000	Jane, where are you?
5459000	5460000	Are you here?
5460000	5461000	Are you raising your hand?
5461000	5464000	Do you want to come up and visit with us just for a little bit?
5464000	5466000	Just for a second?
5466000	5468000	For God's sake.
5473000	5474000	Jane's been on the podcast before.
5474000	5478000	Jane makes a special brand of moonshine called Earthshine
5478000	5483000	because Harman town is a moon colony.
5483000	5485000	So Earthshine is what he makes.
5485000	5487000	How are you, buddy?
5487000	5490000	Where are you living now?
5490000	5493000	I live in, it's called Upstate New York,
5493000	5495000	Central New York around Elmira.
5495000	5497000	So you made the trip here to Toronto to check out the show.
5497000	5498000	Did you bring your kid?
5498000	5499000	Yep, Devon too.
5499000	5500000	Yeah.
5500000	5501000	All right.
5501000	5502000	Hey, Devon.
5502000	5503000	How are you?
5503000	5504000	So you're making moonshine in Elmira?
5504000	5505000	Yes.
5505000	5506000	It's super legal there.
5506000	5507000	Well, it's actually not too bad.
5507000	5510000	In New York State, you can make a limited quantity now.
5510000	5511000	Can you guys hear him okay?
5511000	5512000	Do you need to eat that mic a little more?
5512000	5513000	I need to eat that mic a little more.
5513000	5514000	Okay.
5514000	5516000	Do you sell that Earthshine?
5516000	5517000	No, no.
5517000	5518000	You're not allowed to sell it.
5518000	5519000	It's a labor of love.
5519000	5520000	Absolutely.
5520000	5521000	Spencer drank some.
5521000	5522000	I don't know if you can tell.
5522000	5523000	How are you doing, Spencer?
5523000	5524000	I'm doing good.
5524000	5525000	I didn't drink that much.
5525000	5527000	You know, I'm feeling warm.
5527000	5531000	Yeah, it comes in about 135 proof.
5531000	5533000	So yeah, you definitely want to cut it with water,
5533000	5535000	serve it on the rocks.
5535000	5536000	That's tough.
5536000	5537000	Yeah.
5537000	5539000	Most of these people saw the movie.
5539000	5544000	That wasn't your moonshine, but I was high proof out the hall.
5544000	5548000	Right now, the crowd is going, oh, I hope Dan drinks some of it.
5548000	5550000	You're going to take a poll?
5550000	5551000	You don't need to take a poll.
5551000	5552000	They want that ending.
5552000	5554000	I mean, I'm more than happy to.
5554000	5555000	It's backstage.
5555000	5556000	No?
5556000	5557000	The show's almost over.
5557000	5558000	Oh, there it is.
5558000	5562000	You're going to want to chase it with some vodka.
5562000	5564000	Harmontown Earthshine.
5564000	5568000	I just noticed your logo is like the male-female symbol,
5568000	5574000	but it's like the male thing, but the wiener is kind of bent around the circumference.
5574000	5578000	It's because you're talking about your sex drive diminishing.
5578000	5583000	Actually, I did a bumper sticker version of that that some people have seen
5583000	5585000	that says Harmontown Next Tangent.
5585000	5587000	Ah, it's a tangent.
5587000	5591000	And so it's like an off-ramp type of motif.
5591000	5595000	Now, Aaron told me one thing.
5595000	5597000	Keep him away from the shine.
5597000	5598000	Yeah.
5598000	5599000	Oh, really?
5599000	5600000	No.
5600000	5601000	Bob Scratch gold card.
5601000	5602000	You have one job.
5602000	5603000	Cheers.
5603000	5604000	Oh, no.
5604000	5607000	That's what I did.
5607000	5611000	I mean, it's like it's so crazy.
5611000	5616000	So do you remember talking about on stage?
5616000	5621000	You were trying to interview me, and Jeff kept interrupting me.
5621000	5622000	I'm Bobcat.
5622000	5624000	He just pointed at me.
5624000	5625000	Jeff.
5625000	5626000	Well, it's your seat.
5626000	5629000	I think Jeff's a lot more hurt than I am right now.
5629000	5632000	So when I came up on stage, I introduced myself as one.
5632000	5633000	Glenn.
5633000	5634000	Right.
5634000	5635000	Which is my birthday.
5635000	5639000	And then I was feeling kind of like, oh, here's a chance.
5639000	5640000	There's a community.
5640000	5641000	It's going to be very accepting.
5641000	5643000	I could have just come out as transgendered right on the floor.
5643000	5648000	So I sent you a letter afterwards that you got the next night.
5648000	5650000	And then you read it in episode 79.
5650000	5653000	You read some of it, and you guys talked about it for five or ten minutes
5653000	5654000	about transgender.
5654000	5659000	And it was really cool because you really shared a lot of just very forthcoming,
5659000	5663000	very accepting around the whole idea of transgenderism.
5663000	5664000	Because transgender is the new black.
5664000	5666000	I want to in on the ground floor of that shit.
5666000	5667000	Yeah.
5667000	5670000	I don't want to get shot in the fucking...
5670000	5673000	Say the T word, man.
5673000	5682000	No, but I mean, the transgender thing is like, I can't even say a simple thing like,
5682000	5683000	it's crazy.
5683000	5686000	Like, someone will go, that really offended me when you said it's crazy.
5686000	5688000	It's fucking crazy.
5688000	5689000	Like, it's a...
5689000	5690000	We're...
5690000	5695000	Us struggling to cope with it, to work with it, is a crazy new thing.
5695000	5696000	It's new.
5696000	5697000	It's very new.
5697000	5702000	It's coming out of this whole stigma of being a mental illness
5702000	5711000	and trying to deal with it as like an actual code in the DSM-4, DSM-5,
5711000	5717000	diagnostic manual for people.
5717000	5724000	But the mental illness side of it is that I'm really confused.
5724000	5727000	But society is confused about me,
5727000	5731000	and I'm trying to deal with a society that has all these expectations about how I'm going to behave.
5731000	5734000	What you're saying is, yeah, there was a time if somebody were to say,
5734000	5737000	you know, I guess I was born a dude technically,
5737000	5744000	but I truly feel like I would like to identify as a woman.
5744000	5747000	There was definitely a time, and I think we're still living in that time,
5747000	5750000	when people would go, well, okay, we have a word for that.
5750000	5751000	It's called crazy.
5751000	5753000	And dysphoric.
5753000	5758000	But now the progression is, oh, okay, let's stop calling that crazy.
5758000	5763000	Let's build a society around people being allowed to do that.
5763000	5767000	And as people start to do that, you start to dig a little bit more deeper into just how complex it is.
5767000	5769000	You and Jeff started to get into this a little bit.
5769000	5771000	You started talking about Kinsey scale and stuff.
5771000	5776000	But people are starting to recognize that so you can have this continuum from male to female
5776000	5783000	when people can sit in between somewhere on how they identify, but also how they present
5783000	5787000	and what their biology is, what's their physiology, what is their genetics.
5787000	5792000	Every one of those aspects has a sliding scale.
5792000	5795000	Nobody is at either end.
5795000	5798000	And not only do you not sit at a particular point in any of those scales,
5798000	5802000	you have ranges, and those ranges change with time, and they interact with each other.
5802000	5805000	And that's just the gender identity part of it or the physiology.
5805000	5807000	Then you have the whole sexual side of it as well.
5807000	5810000	Are you attracted to men, are you attracted to women, are you attracted to both,
5810000	5815000	are you attracted to neither, are you attracted to people who are particularly somewhere sitting in between?
5815000	5818000	You have the whole idea of pansexuality or asexuality.
5818000	5822000	And all these variables, you can stack them up in this hyperspatial,
5822000	5826000	and I've developed one of these, I'm a scientist.
5826000	5834000	You can hyperspatially map a person's sexual, gender, physiological identity
5834000	5837000	and you find out, God, we are fucking complex.
5837000	5839000	Yeah, imagine we would be.
5839000	5841000	How is society going to deal with that?
5841000	5844000	I'm pretty sure in 15 years you'll be able to because I see video games
5844000	5847000	where I can choose to be a man or a woman or something in between.
5847000	5850000	Like right now you can still hit a binary switch and you go,
5850000	5854000	I'll be a female, but I'll be a plant creature.
5854000	5856000	Makes the code a lot more simple.
5856000	5861000	The code will break those barriers down and video games will just be like,
5861000	5865000	well, do you want to have feminine characteristics or what does that mean?
5865000	5866000	That's also a dichotomy.
5866000	5870000	My point being that in terms of simulation, we always look forward to simulation.
5870000	5873000	Like 20 years from now, you're going to put a USB.
5873000	5877000	I'm sure that that standard will still remain.
5877000	5882000	You're going to put a key chain plug in the back of your head
5882000	5885000	and for six hours, if you have six hours to spare,
5885000	5890000	you're going to get to know what it feels like to be an adolescent octopus.
5890000	5894000	And you're going to come out of that experience
5894000	5900000	and having totally fucking loved and lost as a female octopus, adolescent octopus.
5900000	5906000	And you're going to go back to work and take over banks and stuff,
5906000	5911000	but you're going to be like, fuck, I miss Stacy.
5911000	5913000	And your wife's going to be like, what were you doing?
5913000	5916000	No, I was playing Tomb Raider.
5916000	5922000	But if we are afforded the opportunity,
5922000	5927000	and I think Thailand stands in evidence of this,
5927000	5931000	if we are afforded the opportunity, we will do a lot of fucked up shit.
5931000	5937000	Tourists will check into a hotel and they will explore different avenues
5937000	5940000	and they will bend different things.
5940000	5943000	We structure our civilization on,
5943000	5946000	did I have too much moonshine is that what I'm talking about?
5946000	5949000	What did Thailand do wrong?
5949000	5953000	Thailand didn't do anything wrong, I'm sorry, Thailand.
5953000	5955000	I've never been there.
5955000	5959000	I was playing on a joke, I thought I would get a laugh.
5959000	5968000	I definitely, it seems as clear.
5968000	5970000	Well, he makes it.
5970000	5974000	It's like a bee drinking honey.
5974000	5977000	Like, big deal.
5978000	5982000	But it seems as clear as it should have been
5982000	5985000	to people who are making their money off a vinyl
5985000	5987000	that MP3s were a thing,
5987000	5991000	that sexuality is more complicated than a dichotomy.
5991000	5993000	It seems that clear.
5993000	5995000	That doesn't mean that anyone should get over their hangups,
5995000	5997000	but it definitely does seem like it's like,
5997000	6001000	oh, we're going to have to get used to the bit torrenting of sexuality.
6001000	6011000	And I have to accept that it's a four-dimensional tesseract.
6011000	6014000	So I'm turning 50.
6014000	6016000	You and me, Bob, we're the old people.
6016000	6017000	Congratulations.
6017000	6019000	Thank you.
6019000	6022000	But I have a lot of hope from the kids.
6022000	6024000	I see that it's just becoming more and more common,
6024000	6026000	a lot more fluid.
6026000	6030000	It's not everywhere and it depends upon where you live.
6030000	6032000	It's a creeping thing.
6032000	6034000	It'll keep moving forward, I think,
6034000	6039000	and people just see people like me, people like...
6039000	6040000	RuPaul.
6040000	6041000	RuPaul.
6041000	6042000	Well, maybe a little bit.
6042000	6043000	No, absolutely, though.
6043000	6044000	I don't know.
6044000	6045000	I don't know.
6045000	6046000	Chaz Bono.
6046000	6048000	I mean, there's just a lot of people who are coming.
6048000	6050000	Bruce Jenner, evidently, which I didn't know about.
6050000	6052000	Well, you bring up an interesting point,
6052000	6058000	which is aren't old people necessarily worse people than young people?
6058000	6060000	Yeah, that is a good point.
6060000	6062000	Because if we keep getting more progressive
6062000	6064000	and accepting and more ethical,
6064000	6067000	then that means that we were less that.
6067000	6069000	Well, we were bound by...
6069000	6072000	So my grandma should be murdered.
6072000	6074000	He has an agenda.
6074000	6076000	Yeah, I think so.
6076000	6080000	If anyone sees my grandma, I will pay $200 US.
6080000	6082000	He's not fucking joking.
6082000	6083000	He hates his grandma.
6083000	6084000	He's crazy.
6084000	6086000	Something that you don't know about,
6086000	6087000	he fucking hates his grandma.
6087000	6088000	I hate all old people.
6088000	6090000	And he actually hates all old people.
6090000	6091000	I'm not kidding.
6091000	6096000	I used to resent young people.
6096000	6099000	And now I hate people my age or older
6099000	6104000	because they embrace their lack of...
6104000	6105000	It's just like,
6105000	6107000	I don't know how the internet works.
6107000	6108000	How do I poop?
6108000	6109000	And it's your fault.
6109000	6111000	Yeah, I don't like that either.
6111000	6112000	curmudgeonry.
6113000	6115000	There's a certain...
6115000	6116000	curmudgeonry to me is like,
6116000	6118000	here's what I like to do.
6118000	6120000	I like somebody who thinks
6120000	6121000	they have a claim to my time
6121000	6123000	finding out that I'm like,
6123000	6125000	I'm 41 years old.
6125000	6128000	Get the fuck away from me.
6128000	6130000	I just like the general kind of like,
6130000	6132000	nope, you're not the first person
6132000	6134000	that's ever tried to leverage me
6134000	6136000	in that particular emotional way.
6136000	6139000	You are scenario 317A.
6139000	6140000	Go fuck yourself.
6140000	6142000	I'm closer to death than you are.
6142000	6144000	Membership has its privileges.
6144000	6146000	That's the only...
6146000	6149000	as far as like...
6149000	6151000	I mean, like culture.
6151000	6153000	You definitely need to check yourself
6153000	6155000	when you're older.
6155000	6157000	It's not adorable or cute.
6157000	6158000	To be like,
6158000	6159000	I don't know how to work this.
6159000	6160000	It's like,
6160000	6161000	figure it out,
6161000	6162000	you fucking piece of shit.
6162000	6165000	Yeah, I find it really annoying.
6165000	6166000	Figure me out,
6166000	6168000	you fucking pieces of shit.
6168000	6169000	I also extend that to movies and shit.
6169000	6171000	I start to feel like...
6171000	6173000	You would hear me complaining a lot
6173000	6175000	about movies if I bothered to...
6175000	6177000	I find it uncharismatic,
6177000	6178000	people my age going like,
6178000	6180000	did you see Iron Man 5?
6180000	6183000	I'm like, it's not for you,
6183000	6185000	you 49 year old dumbass.
6185000	6187000	It's fucking for people
6187000	6189000	who are seeing their first movie ever.
6189000	6191000	That's for 18 year olds.
6191000	6193000	They're not making movies for us anymore.
6193000	6195000	Yeah, there's an art to it,
6195000	6197000	to making movies for 18 year olds.
6197000	6199000	Maybe they did it better or worse
6199000	6200000	in that regard,
6200000	6201000	but come on,
6201000	6202000	you should be ashamed of yourself.
6202000	6205000	Go watch something French.
6205000	6208000	If you're 45
6208000	6210000	and you haven't figured out
6210000	6213000	how to see a good movie,
6213000	6214000	it's on you.
6214000	6215000	Well...
6215000	6217000	Oh, that third Hulk movie,
6217000	6218000	boo.
6218000	6219000	Yeah.
6219000	6221000	You're 45.
6221000	6222000	Derivative.
6222000	6224000	Would you please...
6224000	6226000	I will have that conversation
6226000	6228000	with you for three hours,
6228000	6230000	in private.
6230000	6231000	I'm just saying,
6231000	6233000	don't shake your cane at the kids.
6233000	6235000	If they like Guardians of the Galaxy,
6235000	6237000	which sucked.
6237000	6238000	What?
6238000	6239000	Are you fucking kidding me?
6239000	6241000	It's fucking boring and dumb.
6241000	6242000	What was boring about it, Dan?
6242000	6244000	I'm not going to say,
6244000	6247000	because I'm 41 and I have class.
6247000	6248000	I'm 50 and I don't.
6248000	6249000	I loved it.
6249000	6251000	He's older than you.
6251000	6253000	I am Groot.
6253000	6255000	Okay, part of it is
6255000	6257000	watching it on a Canadian hotel TV screen.
6257000	6258000	I don't know.
6258000	6260000	It probably lost something in the standard.
6260000	6261000	How is that even possible?
6261000	6263000	Is that out in Canadian theaters?
6263000	6265000	Dude, I'm telling you...
6265000	6267000	Doesn't it take like two years
6267000	6268000	for movies to come up here?
6268000	6269000	That's racist.
6269000	6270000	That's racist.
6270000	6271000	That's country-ist.
6271000	6272000	Thank you.
6272000	6273000	Country-ist.
6273000	6274000	It's a cultural thing.
6274000	6276000	I didn't think Guardians of the Galaxy
6276000	6278000	was worth the hoopla.
6278000	6279000	Nothing's ever worth the hoopla.
6279000	6281000	But then I was like,
6281000	6282000	the kids like it.
6282000	6284000	So, so do I.
6285000	6294000	There you go.
6294000	6296000	I enjoyed it.
6296000	6297000	I enjoyed it.
6297000	6302000	Would you call yourself a filmmaker?
6302000	6303000	No.
6303000	6304000	I'd call you a filmmaker.
6304000	6305000	Thank you.
6305000	6306000	I say I'm a guy.
6306000	6307000	I make movies.
6307000	6309000	I like that.
6309000	6310000	When I...
6310000	6312000	Because I would vomit in my own mouth
6312000	6314000	if I heard the dude from Police Academy
6314000	6316000	referring to himself as a filmmaker.
6316000	6317000	Filmmaker.
6317000	6318000	Oh, hello.
6318000	6319000	I'm Bob Sketch Goldfob.
6319000	6320000	Filmmaker.
6320000	6321000	That's why my name's not even on my movies
6321000	6322000	until the very end.
6322000	6323000	Bob Sketch Goldfob?
6323000	6324000	Yeah.
6324000	6326000	No, I had a woman ask me.
6326000	6327000	That's your fancy name?
6327000	6329000	She said, are you Bob Sketch Goldfob?
6329000	6331000	And I was like,
6331000	6333000	I gotta end this conversation.
6333000	6334000	And I go, yes.
6334000	6336000	Yes, I am.
6336000	6338000	I'm whatever it takes to get away from you.
6338000	6341000	That's your rich cousin from Toronto.
6341000	6342000	Yes, coming in.
6342000	6345000	Hello, I'm Bob Sketch Goldfob.
6345000	6348000	What are you doing here?
6348000	6351000	We should get some estrogen up here.
6351000	6353000	Excuse me.
6353000	6354000	Let's see.
6354000	6355000	I don't know.
6355000	6356000	I mean, is that...
6356000	6358000	One milligram twice a day.
6358000	6360000	That's one of 50 questions I have for you.
6360000	6363000	Can you give me some of yours?
6363000	6366000	Are you holding?
6366000	6367000	Look, I don't do drugs,
6367000	6370000	but that would be a pretty good experiment.
6371000	6372000	That actually would be.
6372000	6374000	I mean, we're gonna be able to do that.
6374000	6375000	That's what I'm saying.
6375000	6376000	You're gonna be able to put a USB drive in your head,
6376000	6378000	and you're gonna get to be anything you want for a day.
6378000	6379000	What do you identify as?
6379000	6380000	Female.
6380000	6383000	But I mean, just straight out, that's what you say.
6383000	6384000	Yes.
6384000	6385000	Okay.
6385000	6386000	I have a question about, and I'm interested,
6386000	6389000	and not that you represent the entire community or something,
6389000	6390000	but why?
6390000	6393000	And I'm gonna sound super naive right now.
6393000	6396000	You wouldn't sound worse than Jeff did back in episodes.
6396000	6399000	But I'm wondering, maybe you guys talked about it,
6399000	6402000	Jared Leto's performance in Dallas Buyers Club
6402000	6405000	seemed to get criticized by the community,
6405000	6407000	and do you have anything?
6407000	6408000	I haven't seen that.
6408000	6409000	Oh, okay.
6409000	6411000	Was it too, like, queeny, or?
6411000	6413000	I think I saw that movie.
6413000	6415000	I mean, but what do I know?
6415000	6417000	But I mean, it didn't bother me.
6417000	6419000	You don't know what problem they had with it.
6419000	6421000	Well, I felt like he performed.
6421000	6424000	I felt like he was a dude.
6424000	6426000	I felt he was playing a human being.
6426000	6428000	I didn't think it was kitsch or over-the-top,
6428000	6431000	but maybe the people who had a problem with it
6431000	6434000	don't hang out with the bad ass motherfucking queens I do.
6434000	6435000	I'm hearing a lot of good stuff.
6435000	6437000	I've just seen some clips online.
6437000	6439000	I haven't actually seen an episode of Jeffrey Tambor's
6439000	6443000	performance in Transparent.
6443000	6444000	But it's weird.
6444000	6446000	It's like, any time there's a group that starts to get
6446000	6450000	any kind of respect, there's so much infighting.
6450000	6451000	Well, there's a...
6451000	6452000	Whosever the very...
6452000	6454000	It's the group thing, right?
6454000	6457000	When you have something as complex as transgenderism,
6457000	6461000	transsexuality, transgender identity generally,
6461000	6464000	you're going to draw your Venn diagram a lot of different ways.
6464000	6466000	And I understand that the complaint is,
6466000	6469000	why didn't you hire a real transgender person?
6469000	6471000	But the reality of it is that wouldn't have gotten made
6471000	6472000	that movie without it.
6472000	6474000	And what is a real transgender person?
6474000	6476000	Yeah, what is that?
6476000	6477000	What is that?
6477000	6478000	So, right.
6478000	6481000	So, I mean, I identify as female.
6481000	6486000	I identify as pansexual.
6486000	6490000	I have a male body, mostly, at the moment,
6490000	6492000	but I am taking female hormones.
6492000	6495000	I have a male genetic structure, as far as I know.
6495000	6497000	I have no idea what my epigenetic structure is
6497000	6499000	or the structure of my brain.
6499000	6501000	All these things are mixing together,
6501000	6505000	and since the age of 12 have been sort of moving me toward
6505000	6508000	something where I stand here now as...
6508000	6512000	I know some people who would say that when they get
6512000	6514000	to this point where your body is a certain way
6514000	6515000	and your mind is...
6515000	6520000	You're essentially poisoned by male hormones for 40 years,
6520000	6523000	but you're actually a female that just manifested differently.
6523000	6527000	So, the fascinating thing about transgender-ism...
6527000	6528000	Is that an ism?
6528000	6529000	That'll do.
6529000	6533000	Is the idea that what we're talking about
6533000	6536000	is release from a dichotomy.
6536000	6542000	We're talking largely about transcendence of dichotomy.
6543000	6546000	And yet, there is so much focus, I guess,
6546000	6550000	by necessity on dichotomy.
6550000	6553000	Necessity within the context of the culture.
6553000	6554000	Right.
6554000	6557000	When I was a kid, we had Boy George and we had Prince,
6557000	6558000	and they were...
6558000	6560000	I have no idea what was going on with them.
6560000	6561000	Boy George was my hero.
6561000	6564000	I knew that my parents were upset about them,
6564000	6567000	and the reason they were upset is because my dad
6567000	6570000	couldn't figure out if they were a boy or a girl.
6570000	6573000	And in fact, the heavy metal guys were wearing mascara
6573000	6574000	and all this stuff, and it was like...
6574000	6577000	Androgyny was a form of rebellion,
6577000	6581000	but it was all in service of dichotomy.
6581000	6584000	It seems to me like the dichotomy is the enemy, isn't it?
6584000	6585000	Yes.
6585000	6587000	Isn't the idea that you're either a man or a woman
6587000	6588000	the actual bad guy?
6588000	6591000	Well, it's a matter of comfort, right?
6591000	6593000	Society has a certain comfort level
6593000	6595000	and a certain energy level that's necessary
6595000	6599000	to maintain its structure and its forward momentum.
6599000	6602000	Complexity makes that worse.
6602000	6604000	And when you start acknowledging complexity,
6604000	6606000	a culture begins to say,
6606000	6608000	I need systems to deal with this.
6608000	6610000	I need more pigeonholes.
6610000	6612000	I need more bins.
6612000	6615000	I need more bits in my bites.
6615000	6618000	And that takes energy and takes time
6618000	6621000	until people begin to then sort of relax back from it
6621000	6624000	and say the answer isn't more pigeonholes.
6624000	6627000	The answer is just more acceptance of individuals.
6627000	6629000	Yeah, I always feel like...
6632000	6635000	Don't give him applause. That's my applause.
6635000	6637000	I created the forum for... No, I'm kidding.
6637000	6639000	I've always felt like progress...
6639000	6642000	The big difference is, as we progress,
6642000	6644000	there's always two...
6644000	6648000	There's the progress that lowers barriers,
6648000	6651000	that makes walls that used to be there stop existing,
6651000	6654000	and those are really scary to people.
6654000	6658000	And then there's like militant versions of the progress
6658000	6661000	that actually raise new walls.
6661000	6663000	And I'm always very suspicious of them.
6663000	6665000	I go like, wait, why are you telling me
6665000	6668000	that from now on I have to do this or that?
6668000	6670000	The fear is on both sides, right?
6670000	6672000	I mean, as you're going through life
6672000	6675000	with this sort of a situation like I have,
6675000	6677000	you get very defensive,
6677000	6679000	because you're trying to protect your own system.
6679000	6681000	I could appreciate that, yeah.
6681000	6684000	And across all those different spectrums
6684000	6686000	I was talking about,
6686000	6689000	each one of those subgroups has their own groups,
6689000	6691000	their own barriers, their own protections...
6691000	6693000	Which makes that incredibly difficult.
6693000	6696000	I always feel like you can feel the nails across the chalkboard
6696000	6698000	when we have a transgender person on stage,
6698000	6700000	or anyone that addresses the subject.
6700000	6702000	I always feel like, unlike if you talk about race
6702000	6705000	or class or gender or quagender,
6705000	6708000	you can feel the confusion.
6708000	6710000	You can feel the nails on the chalkboard.
6710000	6713000	You can hear in an audience of 200 people,
6713000	6715000	you can hear one person popping up over there
6715000	6717000	and over there, and then they're going like,
6717000	6718000	that's not...
6718000	6720000	But you pointed it out before
6720000	6722000	about when Levi was up on stage.
6722000	6723000	Right.
6723000	6726000	Because Levi's a very fucking specific dude.
6726000	6728000	He had the mustache.
6728000	6730000	He was talking about how he was owning
6730000	6732000	the male physiology.
6732000	6734000	And he was saying, I'm transgender.
6734000	6736000	And it was like in Los Angeles in 2014,
6736000	6740000	that meant he was an ambassador of transgenderism.
6740000	6742000	And so there were people in the back of the room.
6742000	6744000	Why aren't you a feminine?
6744000	6746000	It was just like bullying.
6746000	6747000	It's like, oh, where's your makeup?
6747000	6748000	Where's your dress?
6748000	6750000	It's like, well, okay.
6750000	6754000	But like right now, so I'm presenting fairly male.
6754000	6755000	I have on women's pants.
6755000	6756000	Nice.
6756000	6758000	I have on androgynous chucks, which I've always worn.
6758000	6759000	All right.
6759000	6761000	I'm rocking my feral audio t-shirt.
6761000	6763000	Now you're making me question my sexuality.
6763000	6766000	Because you're just very similar to me.
6766000	6770000	But 40% of your wardrobe is apparently female.
6770000	6771000	All right.
6771000	6773000	But it's how I'm feeling.
6773000	6774000	I'm going to reach a point in my life
6774000	6778000	where I am going to present obviously female all the time.
6778000	6779000	I'm going to legally change.
6779000	6780000	You heard it here first, folks.
6780000	6781000	Yes, you did.
6781000	6783000	I'm going to change my name to Jane.
6783000	6784000	No, that's cool.
6784000	6786000	No, so is that your goal?
6786000	6789000	Well, I mean, I feel like this could be a three-hour podcast.
6789000	6790000	Because I want to...
6790000	6791000	So you are...
6791000	6792000	Is it different goals for different people?
6792000	6794000	So that is part of the dichotomy.
6794000	6795000	You want to...
6795000	6797000	There is a point where you will be like,
6797000	6799000	I have arrived at a place.
6799000	6801000	You will be...
6801000	6805000	Well, I am arriving at a place every single fucking day, believe me.
6805000	6809000	And what I will do is I will arrive at a place where I'll say,
6809000	6813000	okay, for the good of the people who I have to associate with
6813000	6815000	because of my professional life,
6815000	6818000	because of my family life, whatever,
6818000	6821000	I need to put a stake in the ground
6821000	6824000	where everyone else is comfort because I'm a nice person
6824000	6826000	and I understand that I need to exist.
6826000	6829000	I'm not going to be the militant outsider my whole life.
6829000	6832000	So I'm going to say, okay, for everybody else,
6832000	6835000	preferred gender pronoun is now female.
6835000	6837000	The name is now Jane.
6837000	6839000	And I'm going to be wearing a dress
6839000	6841000	and I'm going to be wanting to use the woman's bathroom.
6841000	6845000	And that just becomes, okay, that legally, socially, whatever,
6845000	6847000	that's a stake in the ground.
6847000	6850000	But that's not something that any transgender person has to do
6850000	6854000	because they have no obligation to society to do anything.
6854000	6856000	They're just trying, believe me...
6856000	6858000	I mean, I'm 50 and I'm just taking these steps
6858000	6862000	and I've known since I was 10 or 11 that something was fucked up.
6862000	6865000	It's taken me this long to get my life to a point
6865000	6868000	where I can just be up here on this stage.
6868000	6870000	Is that why you dedicated most of your life
6870000	6873000	to creating a substance that would fuck other people up?
6873000	6875000	Yes, absolutely.
6875000	6878000	You're like a Marvel supervillain.
6878000	6881000	Well, none of them will know what's going on.
6881000	6884000	They will all wake up every morning
6884000	6886000	wondering what they did last night,
6886000	6888000	who they were.
6888000	6891000	I am androgynax.
6891000	6896000	It's funny because Dr. Horrible is one of my big heroes.
6896000	6900000	Well, I think you should stay up here as a friend of Margaret Towner's suite.
6900000	6903000	When I was a kid, I was in a dress a lot.
6903000	6905000	And it wasn't for the comedy.
6905000	6909000	It was truly like I felt comfortable.
6909000	6913000	And when you were at a high school function
6913000	6917000	and you show up in a skirt, not a kilt, just a skirt,
6917000	6921000	it couldn't be a bigger fuck you to the football team.
6921000	6923000	It would be like, hey, how you doing?
6923000	6925000	And it would be like, it was really beautiful.
6925000	6927000	I used to wear skirts when I used to work on the show
6927000	6929000	and happily ever after on tape night
6929000	6932000	because when they would go, please welcome your audience,
6932000	6935000	and it'd be Marines, it would be the audience,
6935000	6938000	and then I'd come out and they'd be like, er.
6938000	6941000	And one day when my daughter was really little,
6941000	6943000	she was about eight, I woke her up and she goes,
6943000	6945000	dad, where'd you get that sweater?
6945000	6946000	I go, oh, it's new.
6946000	6949000	She goes, it would go so well with your brown skirt.
6949000	6953000	But the reason I did it was it would be really comfortable
6953000	6955000	and it's such a fuck you.
6955000	6958000	Like if you were on the set of Community
6958000	6961000	and you show up in a skirt,
6961000	6963000	you're like, I'm the fucking guy.
6963000	6964000	Go fuck yourself.
6964000	6966000	I think they would actually be like, oh, good.
6966000	6970000	Now we have a label for what's wrong with you.
6970000	6972000	Because otherwise it's just, why is it man?
6972000	6974000	For me, it's such a free and beautiful way
6974000	6975000	to squirt your musk.
6975000	6976000	Yeah, I know.
6976000	6978000	Anything is, yeah.
6978000	6982000	I think everybody should, the way I can access it is,
6982000	6984000	let's get out of dichotomies.
6984000	6987000	Let's get away from it has to be this or that.
6987000	6989000	That's what I can understand.
6989000	6993000	But in thinking that, that's just me,
6993000	6996000	a guy that exists within a very specific dichotomy,
6996000	6999000	that's going like, well, a world without dichotomies, boy,
6999000	7000000	oh, boy.
7000000	7002000	There are people who want.
7002000	7005000	That's why I was obsessing about that dichotomy thing.
7005000	7008000	But a lot of people, it actually is about
7008000	7014000	going from one side of the fence to the other, specifically.
7014000	7018000	Even though to a person who exists on either side
7018000	7020000	of that fence, that person might be a hero by virtue
7020000	7023000	of their transcendence, they actually are making a journey
7023000	7027000	and they want to arrive somewhere and create stability
7027000	7029000	and be something.
7029000	7031000	That, to me, is the confusing thing,
7031000	7033000	because I don't want to offend anybody by assuming
7033000	7034000	that about them.
7034000	7036000	I don't want to look at somebody and go like,
7036000	7040000	oh, you can't wait to be a woman, can you?
7040000	7045000	It's like maybe you're something other than that.
7045000	7047000	But if that were your goal, I would
7047000	7048000	love to get behind it.
7048000	7053000	And again, I can't speak for the entire trans community
7053000	7055000	because it's humongous.
7055000	7058000	But I think, in general, my experience
7058000	7061000	has been that most trans folk are actually
7061000	7065000	very understanding of what's called
7065000	7068000	the cisgendered community, the people whose gender aligns.
7068000	7070000	I'm offended by that phrase, by the way.
7070000	7071000	Yes, yes.
7071000	7073000	I'm starting that movement early.
7073000	7078000	And he says, because we get what it's like to be misunderstood,
7078000	7084000	and if you've waited a long time, just to have someone
7084000	7088000	take the time to ask, it's always better,
7088000	7091000	what would you like your preferred gender pronoun to be?
7091000	7093000	How would you like me to address you?
7093000	7096000	Which restroom would you like to be using?
7096000	7099000	Shall I open the door for you or will you open it for me?
7099000	7105000	All these sorts of identity things that society demands ask about them.
7105000	7109000	Trans people will love the fact that you care enough to ask.
7109000	7112000	Well, I mean, to be the devil's advocate,
7112000	7115000	a lot of people in this room would love to be constantly asked
7115000	7117000	about all their fucking bullshit.
7117000	7118000	Yes.
7118000	7120000	But everybody wants to be a fucking rock star.
7120000	7125000	Right, but if trans folk put themselves out
7125000	7128000	really in the gun sites constantly.
7128000	7132000	And more so than a lot of hidden issues,
7132000	7138000	but it's more for your benefit for other people who aren't trans.
7138000	7140000	Go ahead and ask.
7140000	7142000	If you're uncomfortable, ask.
7142000	7144000	If you're not uncomfortable, don't worry about that.
7144000	7147000	In the past, social movements, progressive movements,
7147000	7150000	have been about people who have been shut out actively,
7150000	7156000	people who go like, you're black, you can therefore not come into this room,
7156000	7160000	and progress has been indicated by people going from saying,
7160000	7165000	I will beat you up if you come in here to stopping doing that,
7165000	7170000	to no longer doing things that they were actively doing because of hatred,
7170000	7175000	dropping things, lowering walls, stopping things.
7175000	7178000	And I think the transgender movement,
7178000	7182000	the part that I understand about it is people saying,
7182000	7185000	drop your gender consciousness.
7185000	7186000	Drop it.
7186000	7190000	Stops thinking about men and women as being different things.
7190000	7197000	That's where feminism and nerdism and blackism and LGBTs
7197000	7201000	and every other alphabet letter, they all intersect there.
7201000	7206000	It's like, stop thinking about the person that you're looking at
7206000	7209000	as being anything other than a person.
7209000	7210000	That person.
7210000	7211000	Get to know that person.
7211000	7213000	Let the boundaries drop.
7213000	7218000	The things that I don't get are the movements that involve new rules.
7218000	7223000	My 41-year-old road comic quills are going to go,
7223000	7226000	I ain't learning no new rules.
7226000	7229000	I will definitely learn to stop doing more shit.
7229000	7231000	Absolutely.
7231000	7237000	I jumped aboard, as soon as I found out that anyone had a problem with gay people,
7237000	7240000	I was like, I am so on board, it's crazy.
7240000	7241000	You know why?
7241000	7245000	It's the easiest way to be progressive in the world.
7245000	7247000	I hate them.
7247000	7250000	All you have to do is give less of a shit about more people.
7250000	7251000	Absolutely.
7251000	7255000	All you have to do is stop caring about even more people.
7255000	7256000	It's fucking great.
7256000	7260000	My parents had to bother to dedicate a section of their brain
7260000	7263000	to keeping gay people from doing shit?
7263000	7266000	What a dumb waste of fucking time.
7266000	7268000	Minecraft to play.
7268000	7270000	I'm a fucking advocate.
7270000	7271000	Get married.
7271000	7274000	Do whatever the fuck you want.
7274000	7275000	It's easy.
7275000	7278000	Like boundaries coming down.
7278000	7281000	I think that's what Irish people, Jewish people, black people,
7281000	7285000	that's all they ever wanted was, can you stop noticing that I'm black?
7285000	7289000	The tough thing is we have these, it's like, you know,
7289000	7294000	in a culture in America, down south as we call it up here,
7295000	7300000	where we truly, it's fucking noteworthy that our progress is like,
7300000	7304000	black men got the vote before white women.
7304000	7312000	We respected people that we regarded as property enough to say,
7312000	7314000	yes, you should also have a say in who is president.
7314000	7320000	And then sometime later, women got the right to also be counted down on that.
7320000	7326000	That is why I think the trans thing is like, holy fuck.
7326000	7332000	It's not because we don't respect people for moving from one side to the other.
7332000	7335000	It's because we don't know what the fuck we were thinking in the first place.
7335000	7337000	It was a tough road.
7337000	7338000	We have no idea.
7338000	7341000	We're just barely gonna, anyways, too much earth shine.
7341000	7343000	You haven't drank hard to any of that.
7343000	7346000	No, I only had a couple of quarts of this.
7346000	7349000	If you told me we were up here for six hours, I believe you.
7349000	7351000	Yeah, I think we're like over two hours.
7351000	7353000	No, no.
7353000	7354000	Let's go to the tote board.
7354000	7355000	I'm 100% sure.
7355000	7356000	I'm pretty sure.
7356000	7357000	What does that mean?
7357000	7359000	That's the time it currently is.
7359000	7361000	That's not helpful unless we know when we started.
7361000	7362000	It started right around.
7362000	7363000	How long have we been up here?
7363000	7364000	Almost two hours.
7364000	7365000	Two hours?
7365000	7366000	All right.
7366000	7367000	All right.
7367000	7368000	How do we end this show?
7368000	7370000	D&D.
7370000	7371000	D&D.
7372000	7373000	All right.
7373000	7378000	Let's very quickly find a woman, someone who identifies as a woman.
7378000	7379000	What?
7379000	7380000	Genetic woman?
7380000	7381000	All right.
7381000	7386000	Let's take the one in the front because we've got no time to waste.
7386000	7390000	And by the one, I don't mean that you're an object.
7393000	7394000	What's your name, young lady?
7394000	7395000	I'm Jillian.
7395000	7396000	Jillian?
7396000	7397000	All right.
7397000	7398000	Okay.
7398000	7399000	Let's get the show on the road.
7399000	7400000	All right.
7400000	7402000	I don't know.
7402000	7404000	I love Toronto.
7404000	7406000	I could be up here for seven hours.
7406000	7407000	Thank you.
7407000	7412000	Who's going to be whom?
7412000	7417000	Let's just see how the dice, you know, roll.
7417000	7421000	Well, I would assume that Goldthwaite should play Quark.
7421000	7423000	That's Jeff's character.
7423000	7425000	I'll play Sharpie.
7425000	7427000	I appear to be Dignity.
7427000	7429000	You should be Christa Berg.
7429000	7433000	Jillian, you're my fiancé.
7433000	7443000	I'm going to start doing a new song called the Transwoman in Lavender.
7443000	7445000	All right.
7445000	7449000	Let's break down those color barriers, too.
7449000	7450000	I'm not going to get music, right?
7450000	7451000	I mean, I don't need it.
7451000	7452000	I just want to know now.
7452000	7453000	What?
7453000	7454000	What do you want to know?
7454000	7455000	I'm not going to get music, right?
7455000	7456000	Oh, fuck no, man.
7456000	7457000	That's all I ask.
7457000	7462000	That's fucking America, dude, where we have missiles pointed at whoever doesn't play music.
7463000	7464000	All right.
7464000	7465000	Well...
7465000	7467000	But if you cut your finger here...
7467000	7469000	Get a new finger.
7469000	7472000	All right.
7472000	7475000	Put on by a beaver.
7477000	7480000	So, acapella, then.
7480000	7485000	When we last met, our heroes had just finished dispatching Father Tindr,
7485000	7488000	who, after murdering the Darmvon household,
7488000	7491000	called upon the evil might of the Shard of Power
7491000	7494000	and was transformed into a massive monster.
7494000	7499000	But despite his demonic new form, teamwork still managed to win the day.
7499000	7501000	But left with Father Tindr's shattered corpse,
7501000	7503000	our gang was looking pretty suspicious.
7503000	7505000	And when the cops came,
7505000	7508000	Dignity lied to the guard while our friends escaped.
7508000	7511000	After trying to figure out what was going on,
7511000	7513000	the gang found an interrogated Spizbulb,
7513000	7516000	who was very defensive towards Sharpie's questioning.
7516000	7518000	But then everybody calmed down,
7518000	7521000	and the lull, Sharpie and Dignity ran out into the street
7521000	7523000	and got hit by a horse-drawn carriage.
7523000	7525000	Was that canon?
7525000	7526000	Yeah.
7526000	7527000	Yeah.
7527000	7529000	They got knocked down.
7529000	7531000	Will they get back up again?
7531000	7534000	Is anything ever going to keep them down?
7534000	7537000	Find out on an all-new Pulse Pounding episode.
7538000	7539000	Give it up.
7540000	7541000	Give it up.
7541000	7542000	Give it up.
7542000	7543000	Give it up.
7543000	7544000	Give it up.
7544000	7545000	Give it up.
7545000	7546000	Give it up.
7546000	7547000	Give it up.
7547000	7548000	So, okay.
7548000	7551000	You guys, you too are lying in the street face-up.
7551000	7555000	Your consciousness slowly, slowly comes back to you
7555000	7557000	and you don't know what happens.
7557000	7558000	Or what happened.
7558000	7559000	You're talking about all of us?
7559000	7561000	Just the two of you that were hit by a horse-drawn carriage.
7561000	7562000	Me and you.
7562000	7565000	When I'm doing the music for you, I'm not listening.
7565000	7568000	I mean, when you're not doing the music for me, you're not listening.
7568000	7576000	Also, when I'm sober and or have had a court of some weird earth shine.
7576000	7577000	Yeah.
7577000	7578000	Some miraculous earth shine.
7578000	7579000	Yeah.
7579000	7581000	So, you got hit by a fucking horse-drawn carriage.
7581000	7582000	I did.
7582000	7583000	You two farther away from me.
7583000	7584000	You see this happen.
7584000	7585000	React.
7586000	7587000	Oh, no.
7587000	7589000	Why did you do that?
7590000	7591000	What just happened?
7591000	7594000	I hope our good friends are okay.
7596000	7599000	I'm going to run over and check on them and drag them out of the street.
7599000	7602000	Actually, I'll drag them out of the street so they don't get run over again.
7602000	7605000	I'm going to say that's successful because I don't have my dice out.
7605000	7607000	I'm going to watch.
7608000	7610000	Does this village have universal health care?
7610000	7612000	Give this guy some dice for God's sake, Toronto.
7612000	7613000	I don't think anybody has any saves.
7613000	7614000	There's no clerics in my room.
7614000	7615000	You got socialized medicine.
7615000	7616000	You don't have dice.
7616000	7617000	No, I have them.
7617000	7618000	They were just in my bag.
7618000	7619000	Sorry, I didn't mean to berate you.
7619000	7620000	A little drug.
7620000	7621000	I didn't feel you were berating me.
7621000	7622000	I thought that was great.
7622000	7623000	No, I was talking to them.
7623000	7624000	I didn't feel like you were berating them.
7624000	7625000	I thought that was great.
7629000	7630000	All right.
7630000	7631000	You pull them out of the street.
7631000	7633000	You guys are injured pretty badly.
7633000	7635000	A couple of your ribs are broken.
7635000	7636000	Each of you.
7638000	7639000	Accurate.
7642000	7644000	I don't think any of us have any healing.
7644000	7647000	Dignity actually does.
7647000	7648000	Can I heal myself?
7648000	7649000	Yeah.
7649000	7650000	I heal myself.
7650000	7652000	You lay hands onto yourself.
7653000	7656000	And you gain back 14 hit points, I think.
7656000	7657000	14.
7657000	7660000	Not very Canadian of you.
7660000	7662000	I don't get that at all.
7662000	7664000	Can I heal Sharpie now?
7664000	7665000	Yeah, yeah.
7665000	7666000	I heal Sharpie.
7666000	7669000	He also takes 14 hit points of healing.
7669000	7670000	Oh, thank you.
7670000	7671000	You're welcome.
7671000	7672000	Get back together.
7672000	7677000	Can we recollect and go back in and talk to SpizzBulb again without you being...
7677000	7681000	I don't know if you remember, Dan, how you were behaving.
7682000	7684000	SpizzBulb's there with you.
7684000	7687000	You were having a La Neve moment with SpizzBulb.
7687000	7690000	Yeah, SpizzBulb's there with you in the wheelchair.
7690000	7692000	He's like, that was crazy.
7692000	7694000	You guys should look both ways.
7694000	7697000	Wait, I was mean to the actual SpizzBulb?
7697000	7698000	Don't worry about it.
7698000	7699000	Okay.
7699000	7700000	You don't remember.
7700000	7702000	SpizzBulb is in the wheelchair?
7702000	7704000	Can I heal him?
7704000	7705000	Yeah.
7705000	7708000	Okay, lay hands on SpizzBulb.
7708000	7714000	He's like, oh, man, that's super good, but my vertebrae are still shattered.
7715000	7716000	Sorry.
7716000	7719000	I mean, it feels less painful, so thank you.
7719000	7721000	Classic, classic mistake.
7721000	7722000	I don't feel so well.
7722000	7725000	I sure could get healed.
7725000	7728000	I got seven per day, so I got like, what, four left?
7728000	7729000	Oh, shit.
7729000	7730000	Can I lay hands on Quark?
7730000	7732000	Oh, yeah.
7733000	7734000	I lay hands on Quark.
7734000	7735000	Quark.
7735000	7736000	Yeah!
7736000	7738000	You feel so good.
7738000	7741000	Oh, mother of pearl!
7743000	7744000	I'm fine.
7744000	7745000	Thanks.
7745000	7746000	Great.
7746000	7747000	This is a great adventure.
7747000	7748000	Yeah, it's amazing.
7748000	7749000	It's adventurous.
7749000	7756000	Speaking of adventurous, you hear yet again a very familiar sound that you've heard not long ago.
7756000	7759000	Sounds like a police siren.
7759000	7761000	We will, we will, we will.
7761000	7762000	Oh, it's Borat.
7762000	7764000	Borat's coming.
7764000	7765000	By why?
7765000	7766000	Why?
7766000	7767000	Why?
7767000	7768000	Why?
7768000	7769000	Why?
7769000	7770000	Why?
7770000	7771000	You hear that sound.
7771000	7772000	We just ran away from them.
7772000	7773000	You sure did.
7773000	7774000	Oh, shit.
7774000	7775000	Well.
7775000	7776000	I wish I didn't eat my wheat.
7776000	7779000	We should get, let's, we should get out of town.
7779000	7780000	I think.
7780000	7786000	Well, the whole thing is going on, though, with Admiral Darkstar in the Angel Body being
7786000	7787000	repelled by.
7787000	7789000	Does anybody else remember this stuff?
7789000	7792000	Where do you think we should go?
7792000	7798000	I'm serious, because honestly, I'm, the last couple weeks have been a mess.
7798000	7801000	And you've been listening, so where do you think we should go?
7801000	7802000	Air City.
7802000	7806000	Yeah, we were supposed to be trying to get to the Air City because, why weren't we getting
7806000	7807000	to the Air City again?
7807000	7810000	Because that's where the robot baby was going to get his memories back.
7810000	7811000	That's right.
7811000	7812000	Right.
7812000	7813000	So we should get out of town.
7813000	7815000	No, we should try to get outside.
7815000	7818000	Yeah, this whole thing was a bad turn.
7818000	7819000	Dignity.
7819000	7820000	SARS guard.
7820000	7821000	I know you work here.
7821000	7825000	I know you've been with us only a short time, but we would appreciate your help getting
7825000	7826000	out of town.
7826000	7827000	I can help with that.
7827000	7828000	Great.
7828000	7829000	She has a horse.
7829000	7831000	Let's take my horse.
7831000	7833000	Let's get out of town.
7833000	7836000	Do we all fit on it?
7836000	7839000	How many people usually fit on the horse?
7839000	7840000	Don't, don't tell them the truth.
7840000	7841000	No, no, I'm asking.
7841000	7843000	These are the situations where the truth will punish you.
7843000	7846000	Like what's the max capacity of a horse?
7846000	7847000	It's too comfortably.
7847000	7850000	You're checking about a palomino, like a luxury palomino?
7850000	7852000	No, like a regular one is like nine.
7852000	7854000	Is a Clydesdale a horse?
7854000	7855000	Yes.
7855000	7856000	Yes.
7856000	7858000	You can fit all of us on a Clydesdale.
7858000	7860000	Yeah, that's a stretch limo.
7860000	7862000	I know Cork's a halfling.
7862000	7863000	No.
7863000	7864000	I know he's a gnome.
7864000	7865000	Do we need to come to see you?
7865000	7866000	No, seriously, I don't know.
7866000	7867000	I mean, two people.
7867000	7869000	Yeah, no, I think you can all fit uncomfortably.
7869000	7870000	All right.
7870000	7871000	It's not a joke.
7871000	7872000	Phew.
7872000	7873000	Whoo.
7873000	7874000	Whoo.
7874000	7875000	I'm glad I'm Cork right now.
7875000	7876000	Can we get out of town?
7876000	7879000	Can we get through the gates?
7879000	7880000	Yeah.
7880000	7886200	You ride towards the gates, and you see crowds of city guards kind of blocking your way.
7886200	7888960	It's going to be, you're going to have to run something over or something.
7888960	7889960	Step on the gas.
7889960	7892960	Jigsaw hazard style.
7892960	7895600	Let's do it.
7895600	7896600	All right.
7896600	7901040	You step on the gas and head forward with great speed.
7901040	7905800	You knock down three of the guards, but then you go through the barrier as if it wasn't
7905800	7908000	even there and blast out of the city gates.
7908000	7910000	This is a metaphor for transgender.
7910000	7911000	Absolutely.
7911000	7912000	I'm loving this.
7912000	7913000	I'm loving this.
7913000	7914000	I don't want this lost on you.
7914000	7915000	No, no, no.
7915000	7916000	This is great.
7916000	7917000	Onward.
7917000	7918000	Onward.
7918000	7919000	Onward.
7919000	7920000	Yeah.
7920000	7921000	We're free.
7921000	7922000	Yeah.
7922000	7923000	Now you're out of the city.
7923000	7924000	Whoo.
7924000	7925000	That's what you wanted to do.
7925000	7926000	All right.
7926000	7927000	Did we lose the police?
7927000	7931680	They're standing at the gates just watching you like you don't want to go out.
7931680	7933240	Does Admiral Darkstar notice the...
7933240	7934240	Yeah.
7934240	7935760	You quickly realize why.
7935760	7940680	There's a large angel demon who's now bearing down on you at incredible speeds.
7940680	7946200	Ah, cheese and crackers.
7946200	7947200	Bearing down on you.
7947200	7948200	Admiral Darkstar.
7948200	7949200	Yeah.
7949200	7956200	You're never going to catch us.
7956200	7957200	And that's a fact.
7957200	7958200	Is it?
7958200	7959200	Nice.
7959200	7960200	Nice.
7960200	7961200	Yes.
7961200	7962200	Shh.
7962200	7965200	He catches up to you.
7966120	7969120	Yeah, but...
7969120	7977120	What seems to be the problem, because we signaled...
7977120	7978120	Is that cannon?
7978120	7979120	Yeah.
7979120	7980120	Yeah.
7980120	7981120	He says that.
7981120	7983120	I'm going to move you.
7983120	7984120	Hmm.
7984120	7985120	All right.
7985120	7986120	That's one thing we could do.
7986120	7987120	Listen.
7987120	7988120	Admiral Darkstar.
7988120	7989120	Sharpie.
7989120	7992120	Butts a lot.
7992120	7993440	Longtime enemy.
7993440	7996800	First time conversation.
7996800	7997800	Actually no.
7997800	8002320	You remember when you were his mother?
8002320	8003320	All right.
8003320	8004320	Okay.
8004320	8005320	They never talked.
8005320	8007800	It was a really dysfunctional home.
8007800	8008800	That was evident.
8008800	8016520	I don't think that your goals conflict with ours anymore.
8016520	8019520	I disagree!
8020160	8023160	I disagree!
8023160	8025160	Why two die rolls?
8025160	8026160	One for the...
8026160	8027760	There are post checks, Dan.
8027760	8028760	All right.
8028760	8029760	Okay.
8029760	8030760	Sorry.
8030760	8033160	We don't have the shard of fucking thing.
8033160	8035560	We have stopped caring about that shit.
8035560	8036560	What?
8036560	8037560	Yeah.
8037560	8038560	That's right.
8038560	8045320	I want this to simultaneously offend you and set us free from our relationship, but we
8045320	8052800	don't care about you anymore.
8052800	8056040	He charges up like Mega Man.
8056040	8057040	Yeah.
8057040	8058240	I can do that too.
8058240	8059240	I charge up fire.
8059240	8060240	Also like Mega Man.
8060240	8067440	He breathes around his form and he blasts from his chest a large humanoid figure made of
8067440	8072440	form and it plops onto the ground by you guys and gets up.
8072440	8073440	Fuck.
8073440	8074440	It's all fiery and made of fire.
8075080	8076080	What the fuck?
8076080	8078080	What's its preferred pronoun?
8083080	8087200	Jillian.
8087200	8088200	Do you ask it directly?
8088200	8090280	Well, we won't know that for a while.
8090280	8091280	Yeah.
8091280	8093280	It's a fire guy.
8093280	8094280	Fire guy.
8094280	8095280	Getting to his feet.
8095280	8098160	Friend or foe, fire guy.
8098160	8099160	How big is it?
8099160	8103480	It's a large size, about eight feet tall, nine feet tall, I should say.
8103520	8104520	All right.
8104520	8110280	Honestly, rabbit hunting with a tank, as they say in my culture.
8110280	8112760	What's a tank?
8112760	8114520	It'll overkill.
8114520	8115520	We don't have the shard.
8115520	8118520	Then you knew you were useful.
8118520	8119520	Right.
8119520	8120520	Exactly.
8120520	8121520	So you're going to die.
8121520	8122520	Well, no.
8122520	8123560	Wait a second.
8123560	8129880	What is it about us that you don't like in yourself that you see in us?
8129880	8130880	For real.
8130880	8131880	Seriously.
8131880	8134800	This is not going on way too long.
8134800	8136360	Are we too diverse a party?
8136360	8139440	Can you not really deal with how many different types of people we are?
8139440	8142280	That's really not it at all.
8142280	8147960	Well, so we just request passage and we just like you have so much more energy that you're
8147960	8150680	going to need to get the shard from the town.
8150680	8152160	Do we know where the shard is?
8152160	8153160	It's in the town.
8153160	8154160	It's in there, right?
8154160	8156280	I mean, it's still like in the ground in the puddle or something.
8156280	8157280	Yeah.
8157280	8158280	In the meat sack.
8158280	8162760	Of which you actually see, you see a dark force on the horizon.
8162760	8166800	You must have passed it while you were coming out, but you're so focused on leaving the
8166800	8168760	town that you just blazed right past.
8168760	8174720	It's a large host of black humanoid creatures and upon closer inspection, they're actually
8174720	8179920	darkened skeletons that have been burned in ash and they're beaten on the walls, the
8179920	8182440	force fields of these doors of the city.
8182440	8185360	They're just crowding out, crowding around it.
8185360	8186360	See?
8186360	8188080	Not a great place to hang out.
8188080	8189080	That's why we left.
8189080	8190320	We don't like it there.
8190320	8191880	There's a shard in there.
8191880	8196720	Also, where is that bag of holding that's told us we shouldn't take out?
8196720	8197720	You left that in the town, too.
8197720	8198720	Okay, good.
8198720	8199720	I just want to make sure.
8199720	8200720	Yeah.
8200720	8201720	And we have our passports.
8201720	8202720	What's the fire dude doing?
8202720	8203720	I don't know about that one.
8203720	8204720	He's just standing.
8204720	8205720	He looks like he's awaiting something.
8205720	8207320	He's waiting for some sort of something.
8207320	8208320	Yeah.
8208320	8211360	If it's all the same to you, Admiral, we'll be on our way.
8211360	8212360	Okay.
8212360	8213920	Give me the robot baby.
8213920	8214920	That's a good call.
8214920	8215920	Oh, don't.
8216520	8222200	Put the robot baby there to intrigue him and distract him, and then we'll run it.
8222200	8229160	So you see from the city coming to town, you see of this large dome-like force field popping
8229160	8234320	out of the top, it looks like the morning star kind of rising from the earth.
8234320	8238580	It goes above the force field, and you can see the skeletons.
8238580	8242920	They're kind of climbing up on the top of the force field, and they gather all around
8242920	8247520	this shard, and in a crack of light, all of them disappear all at once.
8247520	8251520	And Admiral Darkstar is like, what the fuck?
8251520	8256440	Yo, I'm coming for you!
8256440	8259880	And he takes off, leaving you with the fiery humanoid figure.
8259880	8260880	All right.
8260880	8261880	All right.
8261880	8266160	So how bad does this horse have to piss?
8266160	8267560	As bad as a racehorse.
8267560	8268560	All right.
8268560	8269560	All right.
8270200	8272960	Do your best.
8272960	8276240	Fiery figure.
8276240	8280660	You command the horse to piss, and it's a well-trained mount, so it does.
8280660	8285000	It pisses on the fiery leg and knocks out one of its legs for a short amount of time.
8285000	8287280	It falls and stumbles to the ground, prone.
8287280	8288280	All right.
8288280	8289280	Let's get out of here.
8289280	8290280	Let's get out of here.
8290280	8291280	Let's cool it down a little more.
8291280	8292280	Do you want to just run?
8292280	8298560	I mean, what's, you know, what better way to express how we feel than to leave?
8298560	8299560	Yeah.
8299560	8308360	To piss on the leg and leave, because again, we're saying, we own you.
8308360	8310800	You own yourself.
8310800	8313040	Good luck on your adventures.
8313040	8314040	With one leg.
8314040	8315040	And so to us.
8315040	8316040	All right.
8316040	8317520	So we head off.
8317520	8322360	So yeah, on a horse, you can easily outpace a one-legged fire elemental.
8322360	8328520	And you've ride, and you ride until you find what's the only light in this dark place.
8328520	8332600	It looks like it's coming from a hill, like a hill with a light in it.
8332600	8333600	Wait, wait, wait.
8333600	8334600	You didn't have one moment to just celebrate?
8334600	8335600	We fucking nailed it.
8335600	8336600	We did that.
8336600	8337600	That was really good.
8337600	8338600	You left.
8338600	8339600	Yeah.
8339600	8340600	That was great.
8340600	8341600	You're celebrating.
8341600	8342600	You just walked away.
8342600	8343600	This is why Dungeons and Dragons is better than a video game.
8343600	8344920	Like, we didn't have to stay there.
8344920	8345920	No.
8345920	8346920	We just left.
8346920	8347920	That was great.
8347920	8348920	It was a great game.
8348920	8349920	He didn't expect us to do that.
8349920	8350920	I did not expect.
8350920	8353200	He's got to deal with it now.
8353200	8355880	But he respects it, because he's a good Dungeon Master.
8355880	8356880	We just left.
8356880	8357880	We left.
8358240	8360240	That's what I wanted to hear.
8360240	8361240	I am a good Dungeon Master.
8361240	8363560	I don't know if we broke character to just do that.
8363560	8364560	No, we didn't.
8364560	8367760	I mean, to me, it's the most in-character I've ever been.
8367760	8368760	I'm a coward.
8368760	8369760	I don't want to die.
8369760	8370760	I hate fighting.
8370760	8371760	It hurts people.
8371760	8372760	It's true.
8372760	8375680	It's a weird quality for an adventurer.
8375680	8378920	I've always been a reluctant adventurer.
8378920	8379920	It's fine.
8379920	8382560	You know, adventurers come in various shapes.
8382560	8387240	Have you ever seen me play a video game, or heard me talking about one?
8388000	8392600	I hide behind corners, and I try to build up my stealth skill to the point where I'm
8392600	8394600	functionally invisible, and I can cheat.
8394600	8395600	You'd make a great rogue.
8395600	8396600	Yeah.
8396600	8397600	And I'm a wizard.
8397600	8401600	It's a shame.
8401600	8402840	I played rogues my whole life.
8402840	8405160	Are you saying you feel like a rogue inside?
8405160	8411200	Maybe you should continue to transition into a cross-class situation.
8411200	8412720	I identify as a rogue.
8412720	8415880	You know, maybe as Christopher, I could help you with your transitioning.
8416600	8423400	Anyways, we are tasting the fruits of our amazing decision to walk away from all this
8423400	8424400	bullshit.
8424400	8429800	And you ride up to a large hill that has a lit window in the hill, inside of the hill.
8429800	8432400	It's like a hobbit hole kind of situation.
8434400	8435400	That's what she said.
8437400	8438400	Sorry.
8438400	8441400	I hope you come back for another show, Bob.
8441400	8442400	Sorry about that.
8442400	8444920	What do you think we should do?
8444920	8451240	I'm going to boldly go up and look into this window.
8451240	8452240	You see.
8452240	8454240	You see a woman showering.
8454240	8457960	We get rewarded for everything this show.
8457960	8458960	This is Toronto.
8458960	8459960	It's great.
8459960	8460960	Look at this woman.
8460960	8463720	And she's clean.
8463720	8464720	It's true.
8464720	8466680	Are you going to invite the rest of us to see what you're saying?
8466680	8467680	Hey, guys.
8467680	8469640	Nothing to see back here.
8469640	8471640	The home's empty.
8471640	8473920	All right.
8474920	8478040	I...we're in a village?
8478040	8483360	No, this is the only dwelling that you see that looks anything like this.
8483360	8486360	There are some rolling hills and some marshes around, but nothing like that.
8486360	8488120	Well, I guess I go up to the door and knock on it.
8488120	8489840	You guys should just move on without me.
8489840	8490840	I'm serious.
8490840	8495680	It's the only...I'm just going to knock on the door and see if there's anything at home.
8495680	8502680	You knock on the door, and there's no answer, as if someone was occupied inside.
8503680	8510680	It seems like whoever's in there is either not home or doing something that precludes
8513680	8514680	the possibility of them.
8514680	8515680	What do you think, Quark?
8515680	8516680	You wouldn't be interested.
8516680	8517680	She's showering.
8517680	8518680	It's not a bath.
8518680	8521680	Oh, she's showering.
8521680	8525680	Well, so this is the first home we'd come to in miles.
8525680	8528680	Should we go loot it?
8528680	8529680	I don't think we should.
8529680	8531680	I mean, I don't think we should do that.
8531680	8533680	You've been wanting to loot some things.
8533680	8534680	No, I haven't.
8534680	8535680	Get some treasure, yeah.
8535680	8537680	No, I don't know what you heard in the last podcast.
8537680	8542680	I must have been so drunk that...I want to be a good person.
8542680	8546680	Did you see the documentary?
8546680	8547680	That's my shtick.
8547680	8551680	I want to be a good person.
8551680	8553680	So the door is...I break in.
8553680	8557680	Okay.
8557680	8559680	I assume nobody's home.
8560680	8565680	Yeah, you bust open the door and you immediately are faced with a woman showering.
8565680	8566680	Oh, Jesus.
8566680	8567680	Sorry, lady.
8567680	8568680	She screams.
8568680	8571680	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
8571680	8572680	She screams.
8572680	8573680	I'm sorry.
8573680	8575680	I back out and I close the door.
8575680	8576680	I go, sorry.
8576680	8577680	I thought you were in danger.
8577680	8579680	Did the rest of us hear the screaming?
8579680	8580680	Oh, yeah.
8580680	8581680	I mean, it's screaming.
8581680	8582680	What did you do to her?
8582680	8583680	I closed the door.
8583680	8584680	I didn't do anything.
8584680	8585680	I closed the door.
8585680	8586680	I go, sorry.
8586680	8588680	Just get out of the shower and answer the door.
8588680	8591680	In 10 minutes, that happens.
8591680	8592680	What the fuck?
8592680	8593680	Hey, ma'am.
8593680	8594680	What the fuck?
8594680	8599680	Hey, can I...as my calling card, can I say that could have gone worse?
8599680	8606680	Now that you trust me, my friends and I would like to come in and speak to you about a matter
8606680	8609680	of global import.
8609680	8610680	Trust him.
8610680	8614680	He doesn't have the same sex drive he used to.
8614680	8617680	I see you as a beacon of light.
8617680	8618680	That happens.
8618680	8619680	All right.
8619680	8626680	Let's...we sit at her table and I say, ma'am, do you know about the crack of Honduras?
8626680	8628680	I don't know what that...what are we doing?
8628680	8629680	I don't know.
8629680	8630680	Why did we go in?
8630680	8631680	No, I'm sorry.
8631680	8632680	What do you mean?
8632680	8633680	No, I'm sorry.
8633680	8634680	I'm a little drunk.
8634680	8637680	I'm a little peckish, nice naked lady.
8637680	8639680	She's not naked anymore.
8639680	8645680	Oh, well, I have fond memories of you when I first saw you, so that's my nickname for
8645680	8646680	you.
8646680	8649680	Nice, naked lady.
8649680	8652680	Do you have any food that we could eat?
8652680	8658680	I mean, you guys just kind of like broke down my door, then went back outside and waited
8658680	8660680	for me to answer it.
8660680	8663680	It's a custom in my land.
8663680	8667680	We didn't mean to...we're coming from a town that was overtaken by a demon.
8667680	8669680	I guess if it's a custom in your land.
8669680	8670680	Oh, okay.
8670680	8672680	All right.
8672680	8673680	What was the question?
8673680	8674680	We would like some food.
8675680	8676680	Oh, yeah, totally.
8676680	8677680	Totally.
8677680	8683680	Do you know if there's a place where we could stay far from here?
8683680	8684680	No.
8684680	8685680	Like...
8685680	8686680	No.
8686680	8689680	I'm like the closest place.
8689680	8692680	The closest place to...where are we?
8692680	8694680	We're just outside a rose book.
8694680	8696680	Oh, so we haven't gone too far.
8696680	8698680	We're just out into the hills.
8698680	8701680	We should just get provisions and ride on.
8701680	8703680	There's no adventure to be found here.
8703680	8704680	I don't know.
8704680	8707680	I think that she needs to understand that she...
8707680	8708680	Back off.
8708680	8710680	She likes to cut on my gym.
8713680	8716680	I smoke a pipe full of traveler's weed.
8716680	8718680	I don't think you have a pipe.
8718680	8719680	I have a pipe.
8719680	8721680	I make a pipe out of her cabinet.
8725680	8726680	All right.
8726680	8727680	Okay.
8727680	8728680	Good one.
8728680	8729680	And I smoke it.
8729680	8730680	I smoke...
8730680	8732680	Well, you don't have any pipe weed, though.
8732680	8739680	I smoke pipe weed that I make out of the rest of her cabinet.
8739680	8740680	Okay.
8740680	8744680	You cough horribly, terribly, as if you're breathing poison.
8744680	8745680	Okay.
8745680	8746680	And then I go...
8749680	8758680	Oh, kingdoms come and dungeons wait.
8758680	8761680	That should be a good ending to the story.
8762680	8765680	Because adventurers...
8765680	8767680	Get out of my house!
8767680	8768680	We're singing a song.
8768680	8769680	It's a special song.
8769680	8770680	You're going to like it.
8770680	8771680	Okay.
8772680	8773680	Wait.
8773680	8779680	In Dankin' Dungeon, in Dungeon's Key.
8779680	8781680	Bum, bum, bum, bum.
8781680	8782680	In all the world...
8782680	8783680	Play the lute.
8783680	8784680	Play the lute.
8784680	8787680	This happens every time he smokes cabinet.
8788680	8790680	I think that's it.
8790680	8793680	That's the conclusion of our adventure, right?
8793680	8794680	Yeah.
8794680	8795680	All right.
8795680	8797680	Spencer, our dungeon master.
8797680	8799680	Jillian.
8799680	8802680	Jillian, our dignity stars guard.
8802680	8804680	Jane, Jane.
8804680	8806680	Jane, Jane, John.
8806680	8807680	Jen.
8808680	8809680	Jane.
8810680	8813680	Jane, our moonshine maker.
8814680	8818680	And an ambassador to Realms Unknown.
8818680	8820680	And Bobcat Goldwaite.
8820680	8821680	Come tell him.
8821680	8822680	Thank you.
8824680	8825680	Get Willow Creek.
8825680	8827680	Freak yourself out.
8827680	8828680	Oh, sure.
8828680	8829680	Yeah.
8829680	8830680	Watch Willow Creek.
8830680	8832680	Also, he's working on a documentary that's going to blow your mind.
8832680	8834680	But we don't need to promote that yet.
8834680	8836680	But it's going to fucking blow your mind.
8836680	8837680	All right.
8837680	8838680	Well, thank you, Toronto.
8838680	8840680	You've been absolutely...
8840680	8841680	Thanks so much.
8841680	8842680	Forgiving and pleasurable.
8842680	8843680	Thank you.
8843680	8844680	See you tonight.
