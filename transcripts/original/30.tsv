0	24320	Hello, Johnny Dees in Somerville, Massachusetts, welcome.
24320	29880	Harman Town is now in session.
29880	45760	Don't you please put your hands together for the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
45760	50840	Well, thank you Somerville.
50840	52360	We've already had our first injury, Jeff.
52360	56760	I don't know if you saw my entrance, but it was less than graceful.
56760	63400	I took out either a busboy or a cop, or I don't know, I'll find out later in the basement.
63400	66800	This used to be an old cop bar, they say, and it's a very, very old architecture in
66800	67800	the basement.
67800	72240	You can see the firsthand effects of the fact that in the turn of the century, people, they
72240	75760	never grew beyond three feet tall.
75760	78760	There's just a system of hobbit holes down there.
78760	85760	There's just millions of miles of concrete, stucco, just half-built chairs, like all the
86760	93400	whips, like a corpse of a guy dressed as Santa Claus in a bathtub, just weird shit from weird
93400	100000	old days when Somerville was not the best managed town in the United States.
100000	103040	Voted in the Boston Globe, best managed town.
103040	104960	I Wikipedia'd you motherfuckers.
104960	108720	There's some funny shit in their Wikipedia entry.
108720	112240	I don't think the guy that did most of the editing of your Wikipedia entry was on the
112240	116600	tourist board, but I'm all over the place.
116600	117600	What am I doing?
117600	122320	Anyways, I wiped some guy out, somebody write him a check.
122320	123320	That was my point.
123320	127960	Oh, yeah, I guess in the 1890s, people just, when this place was probably built, I think
127960	130080	people just ate dirt and smoked cigarettes all day.
130080	136520	They didn't have vitamins, so everything is kind of shrunken down down there, so I have
136520	137520	a lot of stuff.
137520	140880	Yeah, the mirrors are all, because the ceilings are so low, the mirrors just give you a perfect
140880	142560	view of your balls.
142560	149200	It's just like everything was hung by a deranged midget leprechaun.
149200	154080	Somerville Jeff, some facts about it.
154080	156640	Just to get to know each other.
156640	160760	Most important fact, I think, I'm assuming that Somervilleians would have you know, it's
160760	167240	not Boston, but there's probably a lot of Bostonians here that made the drive.
167240	170400	But Somerville's very proud of its independence, I think.
170400	171720	Or just north of Boston.
171720	179640	Might as well be Boston, but maybe it's a little more wicked, a little less retarded.
179640	180640	We don't know.
180640	181640	Let's find out.
181640	182640	Well, we don't know.
182640	185240	We'll find out the wickedness to retarded ratio.
185240	187920	Major exports, good will hunting photos.
187920	192240	A lot of bars, a lot of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck on the wall here.
192240	195400	A lot of Colin Quinn looking likes walking around.
196400	202360	I'm from Milwaukee, so I know, yeah, there's a lot of my uncles here in spirit.
202360	203360	That's good.
203360	204360	That makes me feel at home.
204360	209200	Yeah, I know how you guys like them apples, or I guess I don't.
209200	212880	I know you like your screenplays horrible, but I don't know how you like your apples.
212880	214280	Yeah, yeah.
214280	215280	You know what?
215280	217040	Everyone gets a pet peeve.
217040	218040	Everyone gets one.
218040	223640	Yeah, I'm not going to go around to the bars and take all the Matt Damon photos off the
223640	224640	wall.
224880	228080	I'm just a petty, jealous asshole.
228080	229440	William Goldman wrote that script.
229440	230440	Okay.
230440	231440	Look it up.
231440	233680	You hate that one scene with the apples more than anything.
233680	234680	That really sticks in your throat.
234680	235680	That really fucking sticks.
235680	236880	I do not like those apples.
236880	238200	I do not like that scene.
238200	239200	I don't understand.
239200	243640	He's like banging on a window, how do you like them apples, and the guy bothers to say
243640	244640	yes.
244640	245800	I like them.
245800	248600	Let's continue to have this conversation.
248600	249920	Who would ever do that?
249920	254080	It completely removes me from the movie.
254800	260600	If that didn't remove you from the movie, Minnie Driver's face, no, I don't know.
260600	261600	It's the Boston era.
261600	266160	I'm getting a jocular and mean.
266160	267160	I don't mean to do that.
267160	268160	I'm sorry.
268160	273080	It's the ghost of police brutality in the basement.
273080	274080	You can just tell.
274080	277160	It was an old cop bar, and you just know that unofficial police procedures happened down
277160	278160	there.
278160	281080	There's too many choices walking up to the stage.
281080	282080	We watched Six Miles.
282080	284320	I remember the scene in Spinal Tap.
284320	286360	We have a shot of us walking.
286360	290720	Beyond the scene in Spinal Tap, every three feet, there was a way to go that way, a way
290720	291720	to go that way.
291720	295640	You would just see a glimpse of a sink with a wig.
295640	298280	We should play our D&D down there.
298280	299280	We could.
299280	305800	We could do, I think they call it, LARPing, live action role-playing.
305800	307080	Facts about Somerville.
307080	308800	The typewriter was invented here?
308800	309800	Not true.
309800	310800	Okay, all right.
310800	311800	Not true.
312160	314160	That's crazy.
314160	319520	The original choice for Somerville's new name, when they broke away from Charlestown, Charlestown?
319520	320520	Charlestown.
320520	321520	Yeah.
321520	329160	They broke away from those assholes, and their original choice for a name was Walford after
329160	334200	the first settler, but then they just changed it to Somerville, which means this Walford
334200	337920	guy, like something turned up, right?
337920	339880	No one knows why they changed it to Somerville.
339880	345280	That sounds like a hasty decision after you went to Walford's house to go, congratulations,
345280	346280	here's your plaque.
346280	348480	What is that in your living room?
348480	349480	Come on.
349480	350480	That's my daughter.
350480	351480	And my mom.
351480	352840	That's the old junkie.
352840	356200	You fuck one sheep.
356200	361760	Something went down at the Walford estate, and then they just picked the name Somerville.
361760	363800	No one here knows why they picked the name Somerville.
363800	368000	They actually had a historical commission look into it, and they said, it just seems
368000	371280	like they said, it was a purely fanciful name.
371280	372920	It's adorable.
372920	375600	It's better than Boston.
375600	376600	Boston.
376600	379200	Well, who picked that name?
379200	383240	A lot of those, like in California, where we're from, there's places like Thousand Oaks,
383240	387560	and there's just no Oaks, there's not a thousand of them anyway, and those used to be really
387560	393000	embarrassing names like Buttcrack Creek and stuff like that, because they were old, like
393000	395800	it was the west, and so a lot of things were called the Big Titty Mountains, that's the
395800	396800	Grand Teton.
396800	397800	Yeah.
397800	401360	Yeah, we have history, too, where we come from.
401360	405080	Also, listen to this bit of history, Jeff, in keeping with the...
405080	409080	This is the first town that I wanted to read entire sections of the Wikipedia entry.
409080	413680	I think this is just so interesting and uncomfortable.
413680	418440	Just hold your applause until the end of this paragraph, or laughter, or cringing, or crying,
418440	422840	or walking out, whatever your reaction you have to this, hold it till the end.
422840	427120	Paul Revere, in one account he wrote of his ride to warn the colonists, mentions a location
427120	429800	in Somerville, then part of Charleston.
429800	434320	The location was the site where 20 years earlier, a local slave known as Mark, owned by John
434320	436520	Codman, was publicly gibbeted.
436520	441440	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, more on that later.
441440	445080	The location is probably near the site of the present day, Holiday Inn, on Washington
445080	450320	Street.
450320	454080	Not written by the Holiday Inn people, not written by Somerville's Tourism Bureau.
454080	455080	Pop by.
455080	459360	Have a continental breakfast on Sundays.
459360	465360	Also a black person got gibbeted, but Dan, that means he was treated to expert luxury
465360	466360	and comfort.
466360	469160	No, I looked it up.
469160	470960	I wanted to know what gibbeted is.
470960	476720	Gibbeted is, at its most humane, it's basically just putting a dude in a cage and letting
476720	480080	him die of thirst.
480080	485880	They did it at crossroads and things to warn if you murdered or stole or whatever.
485880	489360	God knows what this poor guy did.
489360	494120	It was a public warning and probably counts as torture, I think.
494120	495880	I don't know where we stand on that now.
495880	498360	Wait, so they put you in a cage and you're left there?
498360	501080	Yeah, and then you just die in a cage.
501080	505080	I have been gibbeted at Holiday Inn before.
505080	507080	Nice.
508080	510080	Abuya!
510080	513080	White people problems.
513080	517080	I went to a Holiday Inn and somewhere, it was called Indiana, Pennsylvania.
517080	520080	It was the most complicated little turnpike town.
520080	522080	There was nothing to do.
522080	524080	We went to a Holiday Inn and it was the only hotel I've ever been in.
524080	528080	Not only was there no closet, there was no...
528080	531080	The hair dryer and the TV didn't work at the same time.
531080	536080	I haven't seen that since the 70s where the hair dryer affected the reception on the TV.
536080	538080	But also, no windows.
538080	541080	No windows in a hotel room. It was really, really creepy.
541080	543080	It was really like being in a prison cell.
543080	546080	I have some hotel complaints along the way.
546080	550080	The slogan downstairs is, relax, it's Holiday Inn.
550080	554080	The line reading is, relax, it's Holiday Inn.
554080	556080	This is America.
556080	559080	You live in a honeycomb of cement and glass.
559080	562080	Start your own hotel, good luck.
563080	566080	Yeah, we're part of the...
566080	570080	Relax, it's a military industrial complex.
570080	574080	You're sleeping in a bed made by people who make missiles, probably.
574080	579080	Everything's taken care of. Just dig your ditch and die.
579080	584080	Holiday Inn, gibbetting since 1742.
584080	588080	Who says gibbetting has to be uncomfortable?
588080	590080	Slowly die of thirst.
590080	594080	You know what's weird is at this Comfort Inn that we're at, another ironically name.
594080	596080	Damn, now they're all going to come over.
596080	599080	No, they're not. It's 48,000 miles.
599080	610080	Everyone come over to the Comfort Inn where the East 93 meets the fucking cave where the Pirates of the Caribbean are.
610080	614080	We are out of town. We are out of town.
614080	617080	And there's no water in the hotel. That was a new thing.
617080	622080	There was a machine in the lobby that has a water button and nothing came out.
622080	626080	And we all know, when you press a water button, you're thirsty.
626080	631080	You usually accidentally get the amount of water you kind of feel like getting.
631080	637080	When you're thirsty enough to seek out a water button, you get bummed when water don't come out.
637080	640080	That was some Wylie Coyote shit that they pulled.
640080	643080	And then I started pressing juice buttons and none of them were.
643080	651080	I think that's the continental breakfast machine that you get water and juice from 7 to 9.30am.
651080	652080	Hey, Jeff.
652080	653080	Yes, Dan?
653080	658080	Fluff, the marshmallow cream was invented here in Summerville.
658080	661080	There's a look of real pride in the crowd right now.
661080	667080	Well, they're into it. Don't people eat like marshmallow cream and peanut butter?
667080	668080	Fluffer nutters.
668080	670080	That sounds good. I will take that.
671080	674080	Do you do it with Nutella ever?
674080	677080	We're not so different.
677080	679080	We can get along.
679080	681080	Summerville's the home of fluff?
681080	682080	That's so cool.
682080	687080	It was invented here. It doesn't say when, but I assume when...
687080	688080	Thirteen, twenty-five.
688080	693080	Thirteen, twenty-five. Blackbeard is here.
693080	694080	Fluffbeard.
694080	697080	It was a member of the Mohawk tribe.
697080	704080	There's a druid in the audience that turned lead into fluffy marshmallow cream
704080	711080	using the moon and a gibbeted woman.
713080	716080	Okay, just a couple more things, because I don't know. I'm fascinated, Jeff.
716080	718080	I love history. I love Summerville.
718080	720080	Summerville.
720080	723080	The first residential phone line...
723080	725080	This is interesting to me.
725080	730080	The first residential phone line in the United States in 1877 was installed here.
730080	735080	It went from Charles Williams Jr.'s house to Alexander Graham Bell's place in Boston
735080	737080	where he was working on telephonics.
737080	738080	Wow.
738080	741080	So there was some guy that lived here that was so rich and powerful
741080	745080	that as soon as he heard there was a phone being invented, you know...
745080	748080	I was an iPhone douche for a while.
748080	751080	He'd go, when's it coming out? I want my assistant to stand in line for it.
751080	755080	Some guy was like, what's Alexander Graham Bell working on in Boston?
755080	758080	I don't know. It's some kind of thing. You can talk to people without me in there.
758080	760080	He's like, I want it to come to my house.
760080	762080	I want the first one.
762080	764080	He just installed it in his place.
764080	766080	He just called Alexander Graham Bell every day?
766080	767080	Yeah. What's going on?
767080	769080	I'm working on the fucking thing you're talking to me on.
769080	772080	Can you hang up so I can test it some more?
772080	775080	I'm just making sure it still works.
775080	780080	I'm not going to pay my bill at the end of the month if it's not working right.
780080	783080	I think that's about it for the history of Somerville.
783080	785080	Except most recently, Jeff...
785080	788080	There's a big rebirth story here. What were you going to say?
788080	789080	Did I cut you off?
789080	790080	No, go on, go on.
790080	791080	No, baby, come on.
791080	792080	I was going to open it to the floor and...
792080	794080	Baby, let's not fight, baby.
794080	796080	Don't do me that way.
796080	801080	I was going to say, maybe someone out there has some historical tidbits and nuggets.
801080	802080	Well, I bet they do.
802080	809080	That segues into this one little chapter because I read another thing in the Wikipedia page.
809080	815080	Right before the 90s, this place in the 90s, it had this incredible gentrification effort that happened.
815080	819080	And before that, they had a nickname for this place, Slummerville.
819080	821080	It was the...
821080	826080	Purportedly, it was the car theft capital of the United States.
826080	828080	That's pretty amazing.
828080	831080	Why isn't that New York?
831080	837080	You've got to steal a lot of cars to not be New York or L.A. and be the car theft capital.
838080	839080	I don't know if it was per capita.
839080	840080	Maybe that's what it was.
840080	842080	Maybe people have six cars each here.
842080	843080	Say what?
843080	844080	It was a racquet.
844080	845080	What do you mean?
845080	847080	Like, you were falsely branded?
847080	848080	I was financed that way.
848080	850080	Wait, what did you say?
850080	851080	My birth was financed that way.
851080	853080	Your birth was financed that way?
853080	855080	Wait, was it like a mob racquet?
855080	856080	The family car was stolen.
856080	857080	Are you saying...
857080	858080	Oh, so...
858080	860080	Are you willing to come up here?
860080	864080	Or do you need to have a shadow across your face and your voice changed?
864080	866080	Are you in the relocation program?
866080	869080	Because what it sounds like we're hearing is that...
869080	870080	Get on up here.
870080	871080	What's your name?
871080	872080	Cara.
872080	873080	Cara, everybody.
877080	879080	I think what she might be saying...
879080	881080	Oh, she's got like a Harmentown t-shirt.
881080	883080	Oh, did you make that?
883080	884080	I did.
884080	885080	I get off on tangents?
891080	892080	Very nice.
892080	894080	All right, Somerville.
895080	897080	We may do some crowd surfing yet.
897080	902080	I don't know if you heard Brooklyn, but I indulged a 40th birthday fantasy.
902080	903080	I am.
903080	904080	And crowd surfed there.
904080	907080	Here I think I'll just end up with an ass full of hot wings.
907080	909080	It's not your fault.
909080	910080	It's the...
910080	912080	You have more comfortable seating than in Brooklyn.
912080	915080	They were able to lift my fat ass to the back of the room.
915080	920080	Anyways, Cara, I'm assuming what you're alluding to is like some kind of organized crime chapter of your history?
920080	921080	Yeah, exactly.
922080	924080	Cars were being stolen and re-stolen.
924080	925080	Exactly, yeah.
925080	928080	So you would pretend your car got stolen as an insurance racket or what?
928080	930080	Yeah, basically that was it.
930080	932080	And I have to say, this story runs through my family.
932080	934080	Obviously, I wasn't there.
934080	938080	But the hospital bill needed to get paid and so, yeah, there was an insurance policy on the car
938080	941080	and it just happened to get left with the doors open and the keys in it.
941080	943080	What's that square that used to be...
943080	945080	That was like the most notorious place for theft.
945080	946080	What was it, Assembly Square?
946080	947080	Assembly Square, yeah.
947080	950080	So you couldn't leave anything if it wasn't nailed down.
950080	952080	And then in the 90s, how does that work?
952080	954080	There were artists and...
954080	955080	The T-Station came in.
955080	956080	David Square T-Station.
956080	957080	That's how you did it.
957080	958080	Oh, the MBTA.
958080	959080	The subway.
959080	960080	Oh, okay.
960080	965080	So the subway was built that allowed people to kind of flood into Somerville and turn it
965080	973080	into what the Boston Globe called the best managed city in the United States.
973080	975080	I assume that means the cleanest government.
975080	980080	I don't know, like if I'm about to spit out my gum, like a robot comes by and grabs it.
980080	983080	I don't know what does best managed city mean, but it sounds good.
983080	986080	Didn't the insurance companies here kind of like...
986080	990080	Didn't they smell a rat or was everybody profiting off of this?
990080	995080	I mean, I hear it was a pretty good time for a pretty long time.
995080	996080	You're getting nervous.
996080	997080	Yeah.
997080	999080	There's a red dot on your forehead.
999080	1000080	A laser.
1000080	1002080	Yeah, are we sure there's not a statute of limitations on that?
1002080	1005080	Your parents are going to go to jail after this podcast drops?
1005080	1006080	Should we arrange that?
1006080	1007080	Yeah.
1007080	1010080	All right, let's talk about this now.
1010080	1012080	There's going to be a new crime wave.
1012080	1016080	Somerville's going to be the murder, the falling downstairs capital of the world.
1016080	1020080	The starving artists that flooded into the 90s are now realizing that they need to weld
1020080	1021080	something for a living.
1021080	1023080	Is there trouble at home?
1023080	1030080	I'm just trying to keep up the tradition of, you know, mob death.
1030080	1031080	I don't know.
1031080	1033080	Mob whacking your family?
1033080	1036080	Hey, I'm trying to get made.
1036080	1037080	Are you Italian?
1037080	1038080	I am, yeah.
1038080	1039080	Okay.
1039080	1041080	And full 100% Italian?
1041080	1042080	Seduliana.
1042080	1043080	Wow.
1043080	1044080	Piacere.
1049080	1051080	Yeah, I know.
1051080	1054080	Is there anybody Polish here?
1054080	1055080	I don't know.
1055080	1058080	Wash your dupa.
1058080	1059080	Wash your dupa?
1059080	1061080	Yeah, dupa means butt.
1061080	1066080	My busha, my grandma, used to tell me to wash my dupa.
1066080	1067080	Nice.
1067080	1069080	Can I tell you about my great-grandma busha, Jeff?
1069080	1071080	I think a little bit.
1071080	1074080	Yeah, she murdered some people.
1074080	1077080	I think it's safe to say now that she's dead.
1077080	1079080	I was going to say finally dead, but that would sound mean.
1079080	1083080	I just mean finally in the sense that she lived to like 108 or something.
1083080	1085080	And she took some fuckers out with her.
1085080	1087080	Did she drink their blood or something?
1088080	1090080	She was just a hard drinker.
1090080	1093080	She was a vaudevillian.
1093080	1096080	Sound familiar?
1096080	1097080	Yeah, I know.
1097080	1100080	They always said, you should talk to grandma busha.
1100080	1102080	You guys share something.
1102080	1105080	Maybe it skips two generations, whatever you are.
1105080	1108080	And then I'd go, what was vaudeville like?
1108080	1110080	She'd go, what the fuck do you think it was like?
1110080	1112080	Give me a drink.
1112080	1114080	It was on stage.
1114080	1115080	I had an umbrella.
1115080	1117080	A poodle, I don't know.
1117080	1120080	But then she would like, you know, we had to boycott Christmas a lot
1120080	1124080	because she would do one of those things where she would point at her cheek
1124080	1125080	and say, give me a kiss.
1125080	1131080	And then she'd swivel into it and like basically French her grandsons.
1131080	1133080	She was into it.
1133080	1136080	Didn't she stab a dude?
1136080	1138080	She stabbed a dude.
1138080	1144080	She said he fell on the scissors nine times.
1144080	1148080	I don't know how you fall on scissors nine times in your crotch area.
1148080	1149080	On a trampoline?
1149080	1151080	Yeah, I think I'm pretty sure.
1151080	1153080	And I think that that was like when she was in her 70s.
1153080	1159080	So I think the cops thought because we were watching a Packer game in Wisconsin
1159080	1164080	and like this thing came over the, you know, they do local news stuff over the Packer game.
1164080	1170080	And some, you know, some local guy said, oh, here's a human interest piece.
1170080	1173080	A 77-year-old woman was being brought in for questioning
1173080	1178080	regarding the possible homicide of her roommate.
1178080	1180080	Sounds funny.
1180080	1184080	And we all joked in the living room like, oh, Grandma Boucher.
1184080	1187080	And then the phone rang.
1187080	1189080	And it was the police.
1189080	1191080	And it was like her one phone call.
1191080	1195080	And she had had a quarrel with this lover of hers that she was living with.
1195080	1198080	And then we don't know what happened from there.
1198080	1204080	But we know it ended with him dying after receiving a few punctures with a pair of scissors
1204080	1208080	below his waistline.
1208080	1210080	And I think that the cops thought, she's 70.
1210080	1211080	Any sentence is a life sentence.
1211080	1212080	Let her go.
1212080	1216080	And she went on a fucking spree for 30 years.
1216080	1219080	14 people dead.
1219080	1221080	Grandma Boucher's amazing.
1221080	1223080	I have news items on tape.
1223080	1224080	Sorry, Kara.
1224080	1226080	Pull up a bowl of peanuts or something.
1227080	1229080	I just want to tell you about my grandma's.
1229080	1234080	It was well worth surrendering the liberty of a member of my family through my stories to get it yours.
1234080	1236080	I mean, I would apologize for the tangent, but...
1236080	1237080	Yeah, exactly.
1237080	1239080	I mean, wait a minute.
1239080	1241080	She's getting off right now.
1241080	1244080	I should charge you for it.
1244080	1251080	She, at one point, there's a news item that we have on VHS tape.
1251080	1255080	For some of you kids, there was a thing called VHS on it.
1255080	1257080	She, thank you, sir.
1257080	1259080	This is this guy.
1259080	1262080	He's like a veteran in a wheelchair.
1262080	1265080	I remember VHS.
1265080	1268080	Thank you, sir.
1268080	1272080	I got top gun on Betamax.
1272080	1274080	I'm a real American.
1274080	1275080	Me too.
1275080	1277080	Sinbad of the 70s.
1277080	1280080	Tron.
1280080	1282080	All right.
1282080	1284080	Just leave me alone for a second.
1284080	1286080	I have OCD.
1286080	1288080	I want to finish my Grandma Busha thing.
1288080	1290080	Busha means grandma, right?
1290080	1292080	Busha means grandma, so she was my...
1292080	1294080	She's grandma-grandma.
1294080	1295080	Salsa sauce.
1295080	1297080	Busha is like Mima.
1297080	1299080	Irish people say Mima.
1299080	1303080	And some people say pop-pop for grandpa.
1303080	1308080	Busha, she was Grandma Busha, so she was Grandma-Grandma.
1308080	1311080	Yeah, she's 600.
1311080	1321080	She was on the news again decades after successfully murdering a man.
1321080	1324080	This blows my mind.
1324080	1327080	Someone tried to steal her microwave.
1327080	1330080	We think it was like a drinking buddy that she owed money to.
1330080	1332080	She was 90?
1332080	1335080	She was like at least 90, yeah, something like that.
1335080	1337080	Awesome.
1337080	1342080	And she had a scuffle with this person that tried to steal her microwave.
1342080	1348080	And the person took a butcher knife and slashed her in the throat.
1348080	1351080	It's a happy ending.
1351080	1356080	Depending on where you fall on Grandma Busha being out there.
1356080	1358080	Maybe not for the police, it's not a happy ending.
1358080	1363080	Not for the DA.
1364080	1369080	According to her recollection of the event,
1369080	1371080	this person got away with the microwave, slashed her in the throat,
1371080	1373080	and she was laying there for a while and was like,
1373080	1375080	oh, someone will come find me.
1375080	1378080	And then she thought, no one's going to come find me.
1378080	1380080	I'm Grandma Busha.
1380080	1383080	So she got up, wrapped a towel around her neck,
1383080	1388080	and walked to the emergency room where they sewed her neck back up.
1388080	1393080	And there's a tape that circulates among my family
1393080	1397080	of the local news report that's like, oh, they didn't know.
1397080	1400080	They should have done their research and made this into more of a character.
1400080	1403080	But this is a whole new generation of news reporters just going,
1403080	1404080	hey, here's a funny thing.
1404080	1406080	There's a really old lady that got slashed on the throat,
1406080	1408080	and she lived, and she wrapped a towel.
1408080	1411080	And then they show this doctor, they get the statement from him,
1411080	1413080	and you can see the emergency room behind him,
1413080	1414080	and he's just giving a statement.
1414080	1416080	And he has this look on his face.
1416080	1419080	He just watched an episode of The Munsters or something.
1419080	1421080	He doesn't know what he's going.
1421080	1426080	A woman came in about 90 years old,
1426080	1431080	and she had her neck slashed all the way across,
1431080	1436080	and I put some stitches in it, and she left.
1436080	1442080	And he's so confused because everything he's learned about medicine
1442080	1444080	has gone out the window.
1445080	1447080	But the weird thing was, she left through the air conditioning duct
1447080	1448080	in the ceiling.
1448080	1453080	I think I just patched a golem.
1453080	1454080	I don't know what I did.
1454080	1456080	Was it masonry that I did?
1456080	1458080	All right, anyways, back to you, Kara.
1458080	1461080	Did you get off on that tangent?
1461080	1463080	We're in polite company, I shouldn't say.
1463080	1466080	Sorry.
1466080	1469080	All right, Kara, what can we do for you before you leave us?
1469080	1471080	Let's reward you for coming up here
1471080	1473080	and possibly incriminating yourself and your family.
1473080	1476080	There's just some harm in town wish fulfillment up here.
1476080	1479080	Yeah, yeah.
1479080	1480080	I don't know.
1480080	1483080	What's your big ambition in life?
1483080	1487080	What's your unfulfilled ambition?
1487080	1489080	I'm a costume designer.
1489080	1491080	And so do you want to be a big time costume designer?
1491080	1492080	Yeah, that'd be great.
1492080	1494080	What does that entail?
1494080	1497080	Being just about as poor as I am now, but probably in New York.
1497080	1498080	Right, OK.
1498080	1500080	Do you want to do it for film or for print or fashion?
1500080	1501080	Theater.
1501080	1502080	Theater?
1502080	1503080	Great.
1503080	1504080	All right.
1504080	1506080	And currently you do it here locally?
1506080	1507080	Yeah.
1507080	1508080	Oh, OK.
1508080	1509080	And do you pay your rent doing it?
1509080	1510080	Yeah, just about.
1510080	1514080	I have a day job at a self-defense nonprofit.
1514080	1516080	A self-defense nonprofit?
1516080	1517080	Yes.
1517080	1519080	But that's not a very good day job.
1519080	1521080	It's a nonprofit.
1521080	1522080	It's true.
1522080	1523080	You keep looking at your time card and going,
1523080	1525080	God, am I doing this wrong?
1525080	1528080	I keep sliding in the machine.
1528080	1531080	It's a nonprofit, Kara.
1531080	1533080	OK, so all right.
1533080	1537080	Let's thank Kara for coming up and let's reward her.
1537080	1539080	Thank you, Kara.
1539080	1542080	Thank you for making that t-shirt.
1542080	1544080	Sit down, Kara.
1544080	1546080	OK, bye.
1546080	1548080	We're from Los Angeles.
1548080	1551080	We have showbiz shorthand.
1551080	1554080	When you thank someone, it means fuck off.
1554080	1557080	When you say I love it, it means I don't.
1557080	1560080	I didn't see it.
1560080	1563080	I'm not going to say anything about it until someone else says something about it,
1563080	1566080	and then I can see whether I can make money off of it.
1566080	1569080	But no, we would never say fuck off to Kara.
1569080	1571080	Thank you, Kara.
1571080	1575080	So let's just do her big movie.
1575080	1577080	Let's do her biopic.
1577080	1578080	Is Kara Kara?
1578080	1579080	Kara.
1579080	1580080	Kara.
1580080	1585080	The story of Kara going from being a down-and-out
1585080	1588080	Somerville costume designer,
1588080	1594080	working at a nonprofit for a self-defense organization,
1594080	1596080	and making it big.
1596080	1597080	Here it is.
1597080	1599080	It's going to be four minutes long.
1599080	1601080	You're going to love it.
1612080	1614080	I'm in a sewing machine.
1619080	1622080	Oh, God.
1622080	1623080	Kara?
1623080	1625080	Yes, Mr. Haberstrom.
1625080	1627080	I have some bad news for you.
1627080	1632080	Your parents, that are both in jail for fraud,
1632080	1636080	they were murdered by Grandma Bushe.
1636080	1638080	Finally.
1638080	1639080	Wait, whoa.
1639080	1640080	Was there any payout?
1640080	1641080	No.
1641080	1645080	Oh, damn, my Italian blood.
1645080	1650080	Get back to work and sew those socks.
1650080	1656080	I should have stole my own cars like Dad.
1656080	1660080	What chance does an honest girl like me have in this racket?
1660080	1664080	Harman Town tickets get your Harman Town tickets.
1664080	1667080	Big, famous screenwriter from Hollywood, California,
1667080	1670080	coming up to Somerville, Massachusetts,
1670080	1673080	making dreams come true.
1673080	1679080	Harman Town, that's the podcast I get off to.
1679080	1682080	Sir, sir, I'm just a poor costume designer.
1682080	1683080	I only work in Somerville.
1683080	1687080	Everyone basically wears whatever they want here.
1687080	1690080	You should come on down to Harman Town.
1690080	1692080	I got to warn you, the tickets are pretty overpriced
1692080	1696080	for the content value.
1696080	1699080	Seems to me just two jackasses grab-assing
1699080	1701080	for an hour and a half.
1702080	1705080	Guy rapping about fucking everybody's mama?
1705080	1707080	That's not show business.
1707080	1710080	Get a real job.
1710080	1711080	Don't follow your dreams.
1711080	1713080	I'm a threshold guardian.
1713080	1716080	Fuck you, stranger.
1716080	1717080	You're wrong, mister.
1717080	1719080	I leave, but I accidentally drop a Harman Town ticket
1719080	1722080	and one stupid-ass Italian piece of shit.
1722080	1723080	Fuck her.
1723080	1726080	I got shit to do.
1726080	1729080	I got a worthless ticket
1729080	1732080	to a relatively worthless show.
1732080	1734080	I'm gonna go to Johnny D's
1734080	1738080	where everyone else wants to go.
1738080	1742080	Everybody put your hands together right there, Harman.
1742080	1743080	Hey, Somerville.
1743080	1745080	Waka, waka, waka.
1745080	1746080	Wah, wah, wah.
1746080	1747080	Wah, wah, wah.
1747080	1748080	I farted the other day.
1748080	1749080	It was so interesting.
1749080	1750080	Wah, wah.
1750080	1752080	I got fired from community.
1752080	1755080	Booty-dooty, booty-doo.
1755080	1756080	Wah, wah, wah.
1756080	1757080	Oh, my God.
1757080	1758080	It's two years later.
1758080	1763080	I'm Cara, but now I'm taller and better looking.
1763080	1765080	This guy, God, I just had four orgasms
1765080	1767080	on that tangent he went off on.
1767080	1768080	Wah, wah, wah, wah.
1768080	1774080	Chevy Chase, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.
1774080	1776080	Can I come up on stage?
1776080	1781080	And then I saw her.
1781080	1783080	That's when I saw...
1784080	1786080	Oh, my God.
1786080	1791080	Sorry, I just came again.
1791080	1792080	What's your name, ma'am?
1792080	1794080	Cara.
1794080	1799080	Grubet Silione.
1799080	1801080	Ten minutes later, at the end of the show...
1801080	1806080	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
1806080	1808080	Do I get the job?
1808080	1810080	Yes.
1811080	1814080	All right.
1814080	1817080	Well, that seemed...
1817080	1818080	I don't know.
1818080	1820080	That felt...
1820080	1821080	That felt raucous.
1821080	1823080	That felt...
1823080	1824080	It felt inappropriate.
1824080	1826080	It felt...
1826080	1827080	It was a happy ending.
1827080	1828080	Yeah, it was a happy ending.
1828080	1829080	It was a happy ending.
1829080	1830080	Get it?
1830080	1831080	Aw.
1831080	1832080	They were growing.
1832080	1835080	There's a fine line here, shredding hair.
1835080	1837080	Wait, you were about to go to another beat.
1837080	1839080	Where were you going to take it before I did a cheap show?
1839080	1841080	No, you know, if I had done it, it would have been...
1841080	1843080	Because I was thinking we were crossing the threshold of a love story,
1843080	1845080	and then we would have gotten an apartment together.
1845080	1848080	I would have probably thrown an ashtray at her and accidentally killed her.
1848080	1850080	I don't know. I don't know.
1850080	1853080	I was thinking to myself, it was like Richard Gere in a thriller.
1853080	1856080	Your choice was better. It was better.
1856080	1857080	It was way better.
1857080	1860080	I said four minutes. You delivered.
1862080	1866080	Jeff, don't go to me for the professional entertainment.
1866080	1868080	I'm just saying, Cara, your path is clear tonight.
1869080	1870080	That's not.
1873080	1876080	Or any man or woman here looking for a job in Hollywood.
1878080	1881080	I have a perfect girlfriend, and we'll check in with her later
1881080	1883080	about how her relationship is holding up to this tour.
1885080	1888080	I wanted to talk to you, Jeff, about...
1891080	1892080	Okay.
1892080	1893080	All right.
1893080	1896080	We have... I don't know if we roll into this now,
1896080	1898080	because we just had a guest up here.
1899080	1901080	You guys listen to the podcast, and...
1904080	1909080	So there's this guy, Adam Goldberg, who's in the show,
1911080	1914080	kind of by sheer force of will, he's in the show.
1916080	1920080	Describe his origin story for the people that don't know him from the podcast.
1920080	1924080	He's this kid who... I guess he was like an extra in community.
1924080	1925080	That's what he said.
1925080	1929080	His origins are I pulled him out of the audience to read some of my brother's e-mails,
1931080	1934080	and I went to go get another drink, and then he...
1934080	1935080	Speaking of which...
1937080	1940080	The law says we're not allowed to have our bottle of kettle up here.
1940080	1943080	Can we... I don't know who our dedicated server is.
1943080	1945080	Is it the guy I wiped out with the door?
1946080	1947080	With ice?
1948080	1949080	Two.
1949080	1950080	Two?
1951080	1954080	Just the swish of that John Ritter door.
1955080	1956080	That's our only answer.
1957080	1960080	I mean, we can have a bucket of... It's so weird, the laws.
1960080	1961080	It's different everywhere.
1961080	1964080	Every city has fucked up laws about liquor.
1964080	1968080	We were in Atlanta, where they had just recently overcome the idea
1968080	1971080	that you couldn't buy liquor on Sunday, period.
1971080	1972080	I forget.
1972080	1973080	Some city.
1973080	1975080	They were, believe me, like it's...
1975080	1976080	Yeah, it's like...
1977080	1978080	How does it...
1979080	1981080	I don't even know what to say about it.
1981080	1982080	It's insane.
1982080	1984080	People got to stop making laws, man.
1985080	1990080	They have that program where we're turning Russian nukes
1990080	1993080	into nuclear reactors for America.
1993080	1997080	It's called something like megatons to megawatts or something like that.
1997080	2000080	It's like a program which is really just like in your fucking face.
2000080	2001080	We won the Cold War.
2002080	2006080	Give us all your dicks and we're going to turn them into toothbrush runners.
2007080	2011080	We're just going to use your old world penises
2011080	2016080	to now just make our sealy, posturepedic beds work.
2017080	2020080	It's a pretty brutal end to the Cold War.
2022080	2024080	That's an example.
2024080	2027080	Disarmament, sometimes we realize that we've stockpiled too much shit.
2027080	2029080	We need to start reducing it a little bit.
2029080	2030080	So Adam Goldberg...
2030080	2031080	What about...
2033080	2035080	I'm just trying to get car off.
2036080	2038080	What about laws?
2039080	2043080	Jeff, why can't we dig into our vast surplus of ridiculous laws
2043080	2047080	and boil them down into a couple of simple rules,
2047080	2049080	like don't be a dick and stuff.
2049080	2052080	Yeah, well, one guy tried it and they put them on a cross.
2057080	2058080	Too soon.
2058080	2059080	Thank you, perfect.
2061080	2062080	Too soon.
2064080	2065080	Much too late.
2067080	2069080	It was too late like the next day.
2072080	2073080	Well, you know what?
2073080	2077080	Hey, maybe it's time for a lazy Jesus that doesn't get crucified to come through.
2078080	2082080	Instead of getting killed, maybe I could just live to 80 and tell people what to do.
2083080	2084080	I'll volunteer.
2085080	2088080	That's a form of crucifixion, like playing video games and masturbating.
2088080	2092080	You do actually have kind of a Christ complex though, don't you?
2092080	2095080	Yeah, I feel burdened by these people's niche.
2097080	2100080	Talk about armaments.
2101080	2103080	We got a vodka stockpile.
2103080	2105080	So the rules say we can't have a bottle up on the table,
2105080	2108080	so we can just have a choo-choo train of...
2110080	2114080	So whatever that law was protecting, whatever good it was doing,
2114080	2115080	how was that?
2115080	2118080	Ostensibly, there's a 19-year-old girl in the audience
2118080	2121080	deciding whether or not drinking is cool.
2121080	2123080	God forbid she see that bottle,
2123080	2127080	but this is going to make it so much harder for her to go down my path.
2130080	2132080	Did you bring them, sir?
2132080	2133080	What's your name?
2133080	2134080	Matt.
2134080	2135080	Matt, everybody.
2135080	2136080	Did I hit you with the door?
2137080	2138080	Sorry, Matt.
2138080	2139080	Are you okay?
2139080	2141080	Can you come up and tell everyone you're okay?
2141080	2143080	Is that all right to ask you to do that?
2148080	2149080	I'm fine.
2149080	2151080	I'm actually doing pretty well today.
2151080	2152080	Okay.
2152080	2153080	You didn't hit me that hard.
2153080	2154080	Okay.
2154080	2156080	Were you standing in front of the door because you were going to open it for me?
2156080	2157080	I was.
2157080	2159080	I was about to serve one of my tables.
2159080	2162080	That would have been the first, like, cool...
2162080	2164080	Like, no one ever opened a door for me,
2164080	2167080	and I just banged into him.
2167080	2170080	He was going to go like this, like I'm Batman or something,
2170080	2171080	and he's Alfred.
2171080	2172080	Like, he was going to go, like,
2172080	2175080	here you are, and I fucked him up.
2176080	2177080	What'd you say?
2177080	2178080	Restart.
2178080	2179080	Restart?
2179080	2181080	Oh, well, I don't know.
2181080	2183080	Somebody said restart, let him open the door for you.
2183080	2187080	I think the ratio of time spent to entertainment received...
2187080	2188080	I don't know.
2188080	2190080	It's hard to make a judgment call there, but then again you go,
2190080	2192080	why are you bringing him up on stage?
2192080	2195080	How do you explain the first 40 minutes of your show?
2197080	2199080	Thank you very much.
2199080	2201080	Everyone's a critic.
2201080	2202080	Does that mean I can...
2202080	2205080	Why don't you go watch Good Will Hunting again?
2207080	2209080	Inception, yes.
2209080	2210080	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
2211080	2213080	You didn't buy a ticket to this ride.
2213080	2215080	How long have you worked here?
2215080	2216080	Matt, you said right?
2216080	2217080	Yeah.
2217080	2218080	How long have you worked here?
2218080	2219080	About six months or so.
2219080	2220080	Pretty new then?
2220080	2221080	Yeah.
2221080	2222080	Sure.
2222080	2223080	You enjoy it?
2223080	2224080	I love it.
2224080	2225080	You do?
2225080	2226080	Good.
2226080	2227080	What's the best thing about working here?
2227080	2229080	Just the kinds of people I meet, I think,
2229080	2232080	and all the attention I get for no reason, like right now.
2233080	2235080	How many times in that six months that you've worked here
2235080	2238080	have you done a freestyle rap with somebody up on stage?
2240080	2241080	Yeah.
2246080	2249080	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
2249080	2250080	Is it Matt?
2250080	2251080	Yeah.
2251080	2253080	Yo, Matt, I'm the mic.
2253080	2254080	I'm talking Matt.
2254080	2255080	He's the guy I like.
2255080	2258080	Bang to do his shoulder when I came through the door.
2258080	2260080	I fucked your mamas because they all are whores.
2260080	2261080	I'm sorry.
2261080	2263080	I didn't mean it.
2263080	2264080	I fucked your mama.
2264080	2267080	I tried to clean it up afterward.
2267080	2269080	I fucked your mama.
2269080	2270080	That's the word.
2270080	2271080	Matt.
2271080	2274080	And Matt's gonna rap.
2278080	2279080	I'm sorry.
2279080	2280080	I'm pretty white.
2280080	2281080	What's your name again?
2281080	2282080	Dan.
2282080	2283080	I'm Dan.
2283080	2284080	Dan.
2284080	2285080	Nice to meet you, Dan.
2285080	2286080	Nice to meet you.
2286080	2287080	You hit me.
2288080	2289080	Yo, Dan.
2289080	2291080	You hit me with the door, man.
2293080	2295080	You're gonna hit my nose, but that's all right
2295080	2298080	because this job is really great.
2300080	2302080	I'd like to thank you for keeping me up here
2302080	2305080	even though I'm not getting paid for this shit.
2305080	2306080	I'm not really rhyming.
2306080	2309080	I'm just kind of complaining, and you can hear me.
2310080	2314080	Also, that's it for the vodka.
2314080	2315080	It's pretty cool.
2315080	2316080	Oh, right, right, right.
2316080	2317080	Okay, sir.
2324080	2326080	Aww, MC Mack.
2326080	2328080	Thank you, sir.
2330080	2340080	That's how you use stage time.
2341080	2344080	You and me are not gonna make money on this tour.
2344080	2348080	That guy has made $15 more on this trip than I'm going to.
2348080	2351080	Yeah, like Aaron, my girlfriend.
2351080	2354080	My credit card was shut off today from expenditures on this trip.
2354080	2358080	Yeah, well, because our trail looks like a thief's.
2358080	2361080	No one hangs out in Austin in the Atlanta.
2361080	2362080	What are you doing?
2362080	2365080	Charlotte to Brooklyn in one night?
2365080	2366080	I don't think so.
2366080	2368080	You stole a TV.
2368080	2371080	But he, in five minutes, turned it into $20, $40.
2371080	2373080	I gave him $10. What'd you give him?
2373080	2375080	I gave him $20.
2377080	2382080	Yeah, but you're gonna drink more of that vodka.
2382080	2383080	Oh, yeah.
2383080	2386080	I will cause damage to this place financially.
2388080	2391080	The advantage will be mine.
2394080	2395080	No, that's not true.
2395080	2398080	I'm gonna keep it straight and narrow tonight.
2398080	2399080	Now, I want to say something.
2399080	2401080	There's a girl that came to the show tonight.
2401080	2403080	She gave me a gift before the show.
2403080	2405080	I wear tie clips a lot.
2405080	2408080	I lost a tie clip once that I had engraved
2408080	2410080	that said Federal Bikini Inspector on it.
2410080	2411080	And then I lost it.
2411080	2415080	And I hope whoever has it enjoys that Federal Bikini Inspector tie clip.
2415080	2418080	But this girl, Samantha, made me this one.
2418080	2419080	And it occurred to us...
2419080	2421080	Thank you, Samantha.
2421080	2423080	And it occurs to us...
2423080	2425080	There's been times when we've been on the road
2425080	2428080	and somebody will bring us a bottle of Kettle One backstage.
2428080	2430080	But I've been looking around town.
2430080	2432080	The front of my shoe is kind of...
2432080	2434080	The leather's kind of coming off.
2434080	2437080	I'm trying to find some shoe goo, but you can't find it anywhere.
2437080	2439080	So where are we going? Providence, Rhode Island?
2439080	2441080	This is the segment of the show where we ask for shit.
2441080	2443080	Yeah, we'll be in Rhode Island.
2443080	2446080	I'll pay for it, but we just don't have time to stop and do anything.
2446080	2448080	So I'm saying Providence, little tuba shoe goo.
2448080	2451080	I could use some Prilosec.
2451080	2452080	I'm 40 years old.
2452080	2453080	What is that?
2453080	2454080	I forgot to leave town with it.
2454080	2456080	It's heartburn medication.
2456080	2459080	And, yeah, again, we will pay you for it.
2459080	2463080	Aaron wrote down Sharpie pens, two toothbrushes, and safety pins.
2463080	2464080	Okay, all right.
2464080	2468080	So if you're coming to Rhode Island, are you listening?
2468080	2470080	Come with a basket.
2470080	2474080	This is how Egypt mythology started.
2474080	2476080	People are just like, hey, I could use a tangerine.
2476080	2479080	I'll make it rain on Wednesday.
2479080	2481080	People are just coming.
2481080	2484080	Yeah, well, that's not charismatic of us to ask for shit.
2484080	2487080	I will pay for the shoe goo.
2487080	2489080	Do you have toothbrushes?
2489080	2491080	Do you have toothbrushes? Are they used?
2491080	2493080	I'm used.
2493080	2494080	Bring it up.
2494080	2498080	This is a weird table full of gypsies that brought toothbrushes.
2499080	2500080	That's really rude.
2500080	2502080	Gypsies is an offensive phrase now.
2502080	2505080	It's like the end of Let's Make a Deal.
2505080	2507080	I didn't mean gypsies as an ethnic phrase.
2507080	2511080	I think that's become an offensive ethnic term.
2511080	2519080	I just meant traveling vendors of fortune telling and werewolf curses.
2519080	2522080	This show brought to you by the all-new Oral B Advantage.
2522080	2523080	Well, I should.
2523080	2524080	All right.
2524080	2526080	Well, let's see if things are already working great.
2527080	2530080	Providence, we just need one toothbrush now.
2530080	2535080	I would like to raise a barn in back if maybe I'll just live here.
2535080	2537080	Just build me a house.
2537080	2541080	You have a toothbrush in Brighton? Is that nearby?
2541080	2543080	Go get it.
2545080	2548080	A lady just called out, I have a toothbrush in Brighton.
2548080	2551080	Well, hopefully you all have toothbrushes at your homes.
2551080	2553080	It's not a competition, ma'am.
2554080	2556080	I work for a company that makes toothbrushes.
2556080	2558080	You really work for a toothbrush company?
2558080	2559080	Yes.
2559080	2560080	Oh.
2560080	2562080	So you have a factory of toothbrushes in Brighton.
2562080	2564080	I've known this, not Brighton.
2564080	2567080	Were they being cutesy by putting it in Brighton?
2567080	2569080	No.
2569080	2573080	My question is, were they being cutesy?
2573080	2576080	I wasn't being cutesy. You can't groan me.
2576080	2579080	This woman right here works in a dental office.
2579080	2581080	Let's get them up and have them fight.
2581080	2583080	We didn't know until now.
2583080	2587080	We didn't know that we could put you motherfuckers to work like this.
2589080	2591080	I'm sorry. We are humble people.
2591080	2594080	We live in a world where busboys shake us down for 50 bucks.
2594080	2597080	Well, that's the treatment we're used to.
2597080	2600080	This much love we're not used to.
2602080	2605080	Oh, no, no, no. I didn't mean Boston.
2605080	2608080	Oh, nobody's ripping on Boston.
2608080	2610080	Boston's ripping on everybody.
2610080	2612080	That's an example of ripping on them.
2616080	2619080	It is like when you roll into the town,
2619080	2622080	there is a little whispers of, oh, shit, Boston.
2622080	2625080	That town's legit.
2625080	2628080	They're working class.
2628080	2630080	They don't pronounce their R's. They're going to heckle you.
2630080	2631080	Yeah.
2631080	2633080	I wouldn't say people here are rough for me.
2633080	2636080	Some of that may be a little bit more aggressive, maybe.
2636080	2639080	Like up front, like candid in your face.
2639080	2642080	Is that apt?
2642080	2644080	Hey, take it easy.
2645080	2647080	I think that's it.
2647080	2649080	We have friends from Boston in L.A.
2649080	2655080	They have a certain swagger that reminds us of shitty Matt Damon movies.
2658080	2660080	Is Jen Kirkman from Boston?
2660080	2662080	Jen Kirkman's a good friend of ours.
2662080	2664080	What?
2667080	2670080	Is this one of those towns in Massachusetts
2670080	2673080	where the science is now entering Somerville?
2673080	2676080	But it's really funny when now entering Beverly,
2676080	2679080	which sounds like a porn title.
2679080	2682080	Jessica, Massachusetts.
2682080	2685080	All right, so I got on a lot of tangents here
2685080	2687080	because we were about to...
2687080	2689080	Here's the thing. We got this guy, Adam Goldberg.
2689080	2691080	Wow.
2691080	2693080	Remember?
2693080	2698080	The greatest adventure is what lies ahead.
2698080	2703080	Remember at 8.15 when I mentioned Adam Goldberg?
2703080	2706080	He's like a regular in the L.A. shows.
2706080	2707080	He's like this...
2707080	2710080	It's like, you know how Indiana Jones had bellock?
2710080	2713080	Like every hero has a shadow he casts.
2713080	2715080	And you don't know whether to like him or...
2715080	2718080	He's like a brother demon.
2718080	2721080	A lot of my fans are self-styled Dan Harmon's
2721080	2726080	like talented writers who can't make eye contact.
2726080	2728080	A lot of my conversations with my fans
2728080	2730080	look like two guys staring at the floor
2730080	2734080	and accidentally insulting each other back and forth.
2734080	2736080	There's a lot of...
2736080	2738080	Hey, well, no, it's not just you.
2738080	2740080	I was thinking about you.
2740080	2743080	But no, it's like...
2743080	2747080	I'm an awkward person and I have an awkward flock.
2747080	2749080	So Adam is this little guy and he comes up on stage
2749080	2752080	and at Harmon Town, clearly we've proven that.
2752080	2755080	A lot of it is people coming up and us getting to know
2755080	2756080	who's out there and stuff.
2756080	2759080	And now Adam has got this sort of swagger now
2759080	2762080	that he just kind of storms the stage like a bowler.
2762080	2765080	He's become our hamburgler.
2765080	2769080	Like in the mythology, he's like a guy...
2769080	2772080	People in the live L.A. audiences don't like him
2772080	2774080	as much as the podcast listeners because people
2774080	2776080	in the live L.A. audiences are sitting next to the stage
2776080	2778080	and they're going, I could get up there too, but I don't.
2778080	2780080	You're a dick.
2780080	2782080	But people listening are going, I can't ever get up there.
2782080	2783080	So he's my hero.
2783080	2785080	He's like one of those bomb-diffusing robots
2785080	2789080	just putting himself into the Hurt Locker every time.
2789080	2792080	But we're mean to him and then he comes back for more
2792080	2795080	and we like him and it's like, are we being Howard Stern
2795080	2797080	or is that good or bad?
2797080	2800080	Is this guy a genius or an idiot? Is he a hero or a villain?
2800080	2802080	It seems to be kind of like a weird...
2802080	2804080	It's really a toss-up among our audiences.
2804080	2806080	Some people really support and love him.
2806080	2807080	Some people don't know.
2807080	2811080	Some people wish he wouldn't do that so much.
2811080	2812080	We don't really know where it stands.
2812080	2814080	And we're fascinated with him and that's the important thing.
2814080	2816080	But more important than that.
2816080	2820080	Tonight, here in Somerville, it turns out...
2820080	2823080	No, no, Adam's not with us for the simple reason
2823080	2826080	that we have a special unit of the police
2826080	2828080	check the bottom of the bus every night
2828080	2831080	with what I call Cape Fear mirrors.
2832080	2835080	Adam is not here.
2835080	2839080	But Adam Goldberg's two brothers are here.
2842080	2846080	Noah and Harry.
2846080	2848080	Are you guys willing to come up?
2848080	2850080	Noah and Harry, are you here?
2850080	2851080	Here you go.
2851080	2852080	All right.
2852080	2855080	So now we're going to get to the bottom of some shit, I think.
2855080	2858080	Hello. Holy crap. Wait.
2858080	2860080	It's like...
2862080	2863080	There you go.
2863080	2865080	Shake your hand.
2867080	2870080	He said, I don't know if I should shake your hand.
2870080	2872080	I've listened a little bit nicer.
2872080	2876080	Jeff's always been the one to really just shit pretty hard.
2876080	2877080	Really?
2877080	2879080	Well, Jeff will say stuff like,
2879080	2882080	shut the fuck up, Adam, get off stage.
2882080	2885080	And Dan will say, please shut the fuck up.
2885080	2886080	Right.
2886080	2889080	Or I'll say, well, we're all Adam Goldberg a little bit.
2889080	2891080	At what point do I...
2891080	2893080	Where does the bully become the victim?
2893080	2896080	My question, we love Adam,
2896080	2899080	but we kind of hate him a little bit too.
2899080	2901080	So are you listening, Adam?
2901080	2902080	Yeah.
2902080	2904080	All the questions that you've asked,
2904080	2907080	we've asked ourselves for a long time.
2907080	2908080	I thought we'd get answers,
2908080	2911080	but it's a special kind of answer that there's just more questions.
2911080	2912080	That's fine too.
2912080	2914080	It's like black hole research.
2915080	2916080	It's to the point now, you guys,
2916080	2918080	that after the show he follows me to my car,
2918080	2920080	and if we go to a bar after the show,
2920080	2922080	even if I don't say the bar I'm going to,
2922080	2923080	sometimes he's just there,
2923080	2925080	and he'll follow me to my car then.
2925080	2927080	I know he's harmless.
2927080	2929080	There's no concern there,
2929080	2931080	but he's a very forward guy, right?
2931080	2932080	Absolutely.
2932080	2933080	You'd have to allow that.
2933080	2934080	He's diabolical.
2934080	2936080	I mean, he's a genius.
2936080	2937080	He's always calculating.
2937080	2938080	But evil.
2938080	2939080	Genius.
2939080	2940080	Yeah, possibly evil.
2940080	2941080	So when you guys were growing up,
2941080	2943080	are you both older brothers?
2943080	2944080	We're three years older.
2944080	2946080	So did you tie him to trees?
2946080	2948080	We were really bad to him.
2949080	2952080	My dad says that the worst day of his life
2952080	2954080	was when he realized that the kid tormenting him
2954080	2956080	was actually two kids tormenting him.
2957080	2958080	Because we're twins.
2958080	2960080	Oh, you guys are twins.
2960080	2962080	So we work as a team,
2962080	2964080	and it's easy to trick your three-year-old brother
2964080	2967080	three years younger into doing whatever you want.
2967080	2969080	Yeah, and then when you get tired of fucking with him
2969080	2972080	and you just tag out and the other guy comes in.
2972080	2975080	Yeah, we used to pull him out of his crib to play.
2975080	2977080	Like, this was harmless.
2977080	2980080	I would climb up and try to toss him down,
2980080	2984080	and, like, he couldn't catch very well.
2988080	2990080	Adam, I take it all back, man.
2990080	2991080	Yeah, we're starting.
2991080	2992080	Holy shit.
2992080	2994080	So maybe there's your origin story.
2994080	2997080	And, you know, we would walk into, like, my parents' room
2997080	2998080	and you'd go,
2998080	3001080	Dad, the baby's crying, don't know what's going on.
3003080	3005080	I guess you fall on his head.
3005080	3007080	Somebody audibly said, Jesus.
3008080	3009080	That's good.
3009080	3010080	This is human, human stuff.
3010080	3012080	I mean, we did it out of love, but, like...
3012080	3014080	Yeah, it sounds loving.
3014080	3017080	Four-year-olds can't catch, like...
3017080	3019080	It's interesting when you remove the glasses
3019080	3021080	from Adam Goldberg, age him up a little,
3021080	3023080	and move him to Boston.
3023080	3026080	It's a Jimmy Kimmel thing that starts to happen.
3026080	3027080	You guys look like...
3027080	3028080	Yeah, yeah.
3028080	3030080	But you're twins, and you know...
3030080	3031080	Are you identical?
3031080	3032080	Are you genetically identical?
3032080	3033080	Yeah.
3033080	3035080	Oh, okay. All right.
3035080	3037080	So, I guess...
3038080	3041080	I guess when you go home tonight,
3041080	3042080	you can go...
3042080	3044080	Dan Harmon called me fat, I guess.
3046080	3049080	And used DNA to prove it.
3050080	3052080	But I didn't mean it to happen that way.
3052080	3054080	And I'm not...
3054080	3056080	I'm fatter than you.
3056080	3057080	I didn't mean it.
3057080	3058080	I wasn't...
3058080	3059080	I mean...
3059080	3060080	I stumbled into it.
3063080	3066080	How many pictures on Google Images come up of you, man?
3066080	3067080	Oh, man, dude.
3068080	3069080	Yeah.
3069080	3070080	Yeah.
3070080	3071080	Yeah, believe me.
3071080	3074080	Like, before you leak any celebrity's voicemails,
3074080	3076080	make sure you've taken a lot of thin pictures.
3076080	3077080	Like, don't...
3078080	3080080	And make sure your teeth aren't yellow.
3080080	3083080	Like, yeah, that humbled me greatly, that phase.
3083080	3085080	Like, Dan Harmon's at it again.
3086080	3087080	Hey.
3087080	3090080	The TMZ photoshopping M&M's on my chin.
3091080	3093080	Believe me, I did not mean it.
3093080	3094080	Wait, which one are you, Noah or Harry?
3094080	3095080	Harry.
3095080	3096080	I'm Harry.
3096080	3097080	Harry, Noah. Okay.
3097080	3098080	All right.
3098080	3100080	Well, what can we do special with him, Jeff?
3100080	3103080	So, like, in preparation of going back home to Adam?
3103080	3104080	Yeah.
3104080	3105080	Like, we met your brothers.
3105080	3106080	What do we have?
3106080	3107080	He's your problem now.
3107080	3108080	Oh, yeah.
3109080	3111080	So, you guys both live here still.
3111080	3112080	Right.
3112080	3114080	And so, when did he move away to LA?
3114080	3117080	Um, about a year and a half or so ago.
3117080	3118080	And how was that partying?
3118080	3119080	Was it bittersweet, or did you, like,
3119080	3121080	get the fuck out of here?
3121080	3123080	The after party was way better.
3126080	3131080	Adam got on the bus and then a guy in a cop-out bit blew a whistle.
3135080	3138080	We've always had the plan that somehow Adam was gonna be the one
3138080	3140080	to make all the money and be able to take care of us.
3140080	3141080	Oh, okay.
3141080	3143080	That hasn't happened yet.
3143080	3145080	No, it hasn't happened yet.
3145080	3146080	He's working on it.
3146080	3147080	How old is Adam?
3147080	3148080	Like, evil genius.
3148080	3149080	Yeah.
3149080	3151080	Like, the key part is genius.
3151080	3152080	For sure.
3152080	3154080	And, yeah, I think that's what buys it all back.
3154080	3155080	Like, he's...
3155080	3156080	Sometimes he...
3156080	3158080	Yeah, he goes into these rants that are, like...
3158080	3160080	You know, they're kind of ill-timed,
3160080	3163080	and his sense of, like, kind of verbal rhythm
3163080	3166080	kind of, like, doesn't hit the eardrums in the right pattern.
3166080	3167080	But he's, like, what?
3167080	3168080	He's a kid.
3168080	3169080	He's, like, 20-something.
3169080	3170080	Twenty-something.
3170080	3171080	And...
3171080	3174080	But, you know, when you actually listen to what he's saying,
3174080	3175080	he's, like, you know...
3175080	3176080	A lot of people...
3176080	3177080	A lot of people said he's really smart.
3177080	3179080	A lot of people don't know what to make of him.
3179080	3180080	Yeah.
3180080	3181080	Understatement.
3181080	3182080	Yeah.
3182080	3185080	But the thing is that once you get his character
3185080	3189080	and his personality, a lot of the stuff he says is pretty genius.
3189080	3190080	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3190080	3193080	I think he works well with an editor, like...
3194080	3196080	Well, it's the comedy rule of threes, right?
3196080	3198080	One out of three things he says is funny.
3198080	3199080	Like...
3199080	3200080	Yeah, yeah.
3200080	3201080	Like, obviously, you're a writer.
3201080	3202080	You know this.
3202080	3203080	Like, you don't do it all yourself.
3203080	3205080	You need a team around you to...
3205080	3206080	Exactly.
3206080	3208080	Like, if we could have cut out me accidentally calling you fat,
3208080	3211080	like, I would be, like, a great fucking host.
3211080	3212080	That's my favorite part.
3213080	3214080	Uh, yeah, I can go...
3214080	3216080	I will go back and edit that out of the podcast.
3216080	3218080	And then I'll seem like a very charming guy.
3218080	3219080	Do you guys wanna...
3219080	3221080	Uh, maybe do you guys wanna, like, take this opportunity?
3221080	3222080	Because I would...
3222080	3225080	I mean, I presume that Adam will be listening to these podcasts
3225080	3226080	as they're coming out.
3226080	3228080	I mean, anybody would, because it's certainly, like,
3228080	3229080	even just out of simple...
3229080	3231080	Oh, he doesn't have my phone number.
3231080	3232080	It's cool.
3232080	3233080	He doesn't have your phone number.
3233080	3234080	No, I'm kidding.
3234080	3235080	Okay.
3236080	3238080	I'd say maybe, like, you guys can send a little, like, uh,
3238080	3240080	little video, uh...
3240080	3242080	I mean, sorry, an audio letter to him, you know,
3242080	3244080	like a little wistful, you know, brotherly contact,
3244080	3246080	you know, over a thing.
3246080	3247080	Give him a little soundtrack.
3247080	3248080	That's all you know.
3250080	3252080	This is your letter... your open letter to Adam.
3252080	3253080	Whatever you wanna say to him.
3253080	3257080	Adam, Mom and Dad just really want you to get a job.
3259080	3261080	We know, we know you're trying.
3261080	3264080	We know you're trying, but try harder.
3265080	3267080	Times are tough for everyone.
3268080	3270080	When they saw you in the background as a community
3270080	3273080	and you looked within 20 years at Chevy Chase,
3273080	3275080	that is not a good look.
3279080	3281080	So keep going. We love you. We support you.
3283080	3285080	The Friars Club sponsor this letter?
3286080	3289080	All right, the thing you can do for us
3289080	3291080	is not let him respond to this,
3291080	3293080	because it's gonna be way worse for us.
3293080	3295080	Well, yeah, but yeah, so you guys are scared of his,
3295080	3297080	like, his brain and his mouth, right?
3297080	3299080	Like, he'll level that weird...
3299080	3300080	There's still two of us.
3300080	3302080	Yeah, Lex Luthor death ray.
3302080	3306080	Uh, yeah, so Adam, okay, physically they can still kick your ass,
3306080	3308080	but, uh, you got away.
3308080	3310080	They would like you to make some money.
3310080	3312080	Can I ask a question here?
3312080	3314080	To the audience, like,
3314080	3318080	I know the L.A. audience is kind of, like...
3318080	3319080	Skeptical?
3319080	3320080	Skeptical.
3320080	3322080	But, like, of the people listening,
3322080	3326080	like, how does it play out for just listening here, just...
3326080	3328080	Were you asking these people?
3328080	3330080	I thought he was a writer in community.
3330080	3331080	Oh, okay.
3333080	3336080	I just figured that he actually, like, had a role.
3336080	3339080	This young lady said I thought he was a writer in community.
3339080	3341080	He probably texted you and told you that.
3343080	3345080	There's a diabolical quality to him.
3345080	3347080	He ends up with everybody's phone number.
3347080	3348080	One time we were at the drawing room...
3348080	3349080	Mostly women, though.
3349080	3350080	Yeah, yeah.
3350080	3351080	After a bar...
3351080	3353080	After we go to this one bar after our show,
3353080	3356080	and I was there, and he was working on some girl,
3356080	3358080	and the girl had a friend, and he was drunk.
3358080	3360080	They were dead drunk, and he's like,
3360080	3362080	Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, come here.
3362080	3363080	Give me your phone number.
3363080	3364080	I'm like, no.
3365080	3366080	Give me your phone number.
3366080	3368080	Adam, fucking no way.
3368080	3369080	No.
3369080	3371080	But he gets all the women's digits
3371080	3374080	in, like, crazy, weird Jedi ways.
3374080	3375080	He...
3375080	3377080	It was present the moment when he walked up to Aaron,
3377080	3378080	and he said,
3378080	3381080	So, Aaron, my AT&T fucked up my phone,
3381080	3383080	and I finally got it back, and I lost your number.
3383080	3384080	I needed your number again.
3384080	3385080	And Aaron kind of went,
3385080	3387080	Oh, 818, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3387080	3389080	I gave it to him, and he walked away,
3389080	3390080	and Aaron had this blank expression.
3390080	3392080	I said, I never gave him my number.
3393080	3394080	It's no joke, man.
3394080	3395080	That's no joke.
3395080	3396080	He's a Jedi.
3396080	3398080	These are not the droids you want.
3398080	3399080	Yeah.
3399080	3400080	I didn't put anything in your drink.
3400080	3401080	Did you ever read the book?
3401080	3403080	Did you ever read the book by Bud Shillman?
3403080	3405080	What makes Sammy run about this character, Sammy Glick?
3405080	3406080	I haven't read it.
3406080	3407080	Yeah, it's a good...
3407080	3408080	Read that book.
3408080	3409080	It's about a guy that...
3409080	3412080	He's just this little, like, guy, newspaperman,
3412080	3414080	a guy that runs the papers and stuff like that,
3414080	3416080	and he ends up running a studio in Hollywood,
3416080	3417080	simply out of will.
3417080	3421080	And just, like, the idea that there's nothing...
3421080	3423080	There's no such thing as a human obstacle.
3423080	3425080	Like, people are things you can just move around
3425080	3426080	like chess pieces.
3426080	3428080	And it's not willfully mean.
3428080	3430080	It's just the idea that the goal is something
3430080	3433080	that's more important than the steps along the way.
3433080	3435080	And is it genetics that makes your brain like that?
3435080	3437080	Or is it your older brothers playing...
3437080	3438080	Head injuries.
3438080	3440080	Catch the baby out of the cradle.
3442080	3444080	Probably a combination of that and head injuries.
3444080	3445080	Definitely.
3445080	3447080	All right, Noah and Harry, let's hear it for the Goldberg brothers.
3447080	3449080	Goldberg brothers!
3452080	3453080	Thank you, guys.
3453080	3454080	Thank you, Noah.
3454080	3455080	Thank you, Harry.
3456080	3457080	We've never...
3457080	3459080	We've never had a disaster, Jeff.
3459080	3461080	We just bring random people up on stage and...
3461080	3464080	Like, you're trained for the stand-up, like, mythology
3464080	3466080	and TV and stuff.
3466080	3468080	Like, when somebody starts popping off in the audience,
3468080	3470080	everyone gets as uncomfortable as when, like,
3470080	3472080	a baby is crying on an airplane.
3472080	3473080	It's like, there's a crisis.
3473080	3474080	There's something happening.
3474080	3475080	This is gonna go bad.
3475080	3477080	Like, what's Rob Schneider gonna do?
3479080	3481080	But on our show, I know we're spoiled
3481080	3483080	because all these audiences are people who, you know,
3483080	3484080	they listen to the podcast, they come out,
3484080	3485080	they drive a long way, they pay money,
3485080	3487080	and they're ready to have a good time.
3487080	3489080	But, like, I just love the human experiment.
3489080	3492080	You can just drag people up and they're like,
3492080	3494080	I don't know, and they start rapping
3494080	3496080	and they fucking bury the show.
3496080	3499080	But when Noah came up, he gave me a pretty stern look
3499080	3502080	and he goes, I don't even know if I should shake your hand.
3502080	3504080	I thought it was because he was protective of Adam.
3504080	3507080	Yeah, and then he just completely threw Adam under the bus.
3507080	3508080	I mean, he really meant it.
3508080	3510080	I don't know if I should shake your hand.
3510080	3511080	I don't know.
3511080	3513080	You texted me.
3513080	3514080	What?
3514080	3515080	Adam didn't text me.
3515080	3516080	Is he here?
3516080	3517080	Well, come on, Aaron.
3517080	3518080	Come on, Aaron.
3518080	3519080	Aaron McGathey.
3521080	3522080	This could go bad.
3522080	3524080	I mean, I never know what this one...
3526080	3529080	Well, all I was gonna say is that Adam just texted me
3529080	3531080	where my brother's drips.
3532080	3533080	Wow.
3533080	3534080	See you guys.
3535080	3537080	Aaron McGathey, everybody.
3538080	3541080	Sniped from a distance by the Goldberg sniper rifle.
3541080	3543080	And yet the blood does kind of run cold.
3543080	3546080	Like, Beetlejuice, we've mentioned his name so many times
3546080	3548080	and he just starts texting people.
3548080	3549080	That's fucking cool.
3549080	3551080	Yeah, he's like Sherlock Holmes in that new remake
3551080	3552080	and the BBC.
3552080	3553080	I was like, what?
3553080	3554080	There's texts coming up.
3555080	3557080	He knows we're talking about him.
3557080	3558080	Having fun, Mr. Harmon?
3558080	3559080	Yeah.
3560080	3562080	You amused me, so...
3564080	3565080	He's like Q.
3565080	3567080	He's not my bellock.
3567080	3569080	He's my Q from New Star Trek.
3569080	3570080	New Star Trek.
3570080	3572080	I'm gonna get laid in Boston.
3574080	3576080	Star Trek Next Generation reference!
3576080	3577080	All right.
3578080	3580080	Jeff, just running through a couple more things.
3580080	3582080	We're gonna be in Rhode Island tomorrow night
3582080	3584080	and we really encourage...
3584080	3586080	Is there any incentive we can give people?
3586080	3587080	Because it's not that long a drive
3587080	3589080	and apparently we're undersold there.
3589080	3590080	We're sold out here.
3590080	3591080	We've been sold...
3591080	3592080	Drugs?
3594080	3595080	I'm finding out.
3595080	3596080	I'll get the location. Hang on.
3597080	3598080	Is it 45 minutes?
3598080	3599080	Yeah, no big deal.
3599080	3601080	It's like a drive to Grandma's house.
3601080	3603080	Yeah, Providence. East Providence.
3604080	3606080	I have a vaporizer in the tour bus.
3608080	3610080	They're saying there's lots of drugs there.
3610080	3611080	Oh.
3611080	3612080	Is that what you're saying?
3612080	3614080	Oh, no, no. We're going to Rhode Island.
3614080	3616080	No, I think he's speaking the same way.
3616080	3618080	I'm saying, is there anything we can incentivize people
3618080	3620080	to form a little caravan and come to...
3620080	3622080	Let's just go fill the seats at the Rhode Island show.
3624080	3625080	Shoo-goo.
3625080	3626080	Shoo-goo.
3626080	3628080	Shoo-goo. Well, that's all incentive for us.
3628080	3631080	We're going to be at the Comedy Connection
3631080	3634080	on Warren Avenue in East Providence, Rhode Island tomorrow night.
3634080	3635080	Right.
3637080	3639080	Well, Aaron says you're going to get a special button
3639080	3642080	if you use the past phrase,
3642080	3645080	I came here from Johnny D's.
3646080	3649080	Also, Spencer will give the first 40 people in the door
3649080	3651080	a 20-minute deep tissue massage.
3653080	3654080	Let's bring Spencer up on stage.
3654080	3655080	Spencer, get up here.
3656080	3657080	Yeah.
3662080	3663080	Oh, shit, Spencer.
3663080	3664080	Yeah.
3664080	3667080	He's wearing his Apple Store sweatshirt.
3668080	3671080	Spencer, we're sharing a table tonight, kind of.
3671080	3673080	I got my little dead soldiers.
3673080	3674080	Do you want me to start over?
3674080	3675080	No, no, no, no, no, no.
3675080	3676080	All right.
3676080	3677080	You're fine.
3677080	3678080	What up?
3679080	3681080	Again, for those of you who already know Spencer,
3681080	3682080	he's our dungeon master.
3682080	3683080	For those of you who don't,
3683080	3687080	he is going to master a dungeon later on,
3687080	3688080	and God bless him.
3688080	3691080	But we didn't know this guy really from Adam,
3691080	3692080	and not Adam Goldberg,
3692080	3694080	but from the old Adam,
3694080	3696080	when we embarked on our tour.
3696080	3697080	But I find Spencer,
3697080	3702080	you've been an absolute gem of a tour companion to have on the bus.
3702080	3703080	Jeff, really quick.
3703080	3705080	I want to roll out some chicken noodle.
3705080	3706080	Chicken noodle.
3706080	3707080	Oh, yeah.
3707080	3709080	Spencer, did you help write the chicken noodle song?
3709080	3710080	No, I came in during the end.
3710080	3712080	I might be able to help you guys out, though.
3712080	3713080	Okay.
3713080	3716080	So, Dan, I have some stupid tour bus songs
3716080	3718080	about, like, I hold things up to my dick,
3718080	3719080	and, like, there's Pringles' dick,
3719080	3722080	and I was like, take a sip of my dick.
3722080	3723080	Some people call me Pringles' dick,
3723080	3725080	but I never really found out why.
3725080	3726080	You're holding the Pringles' dick.
3726080	3728080	I don't really have a Pringles' dick,
3728080	3731080	I just keep my dick inside.
3731080	3733080	I keep my dick inside a Pringles' can
3733080	3736080	because it keeps my penis safe and dry.
3736080	3738080	Some people call me Pringles' dick,
3738080	3740080	but I never really found out.
3740080	3743080	No, I never found out, never really found out why.
3743080	3744080	That's a song you can sing
3744080	3747080	while you hold a Pringles' can on your dick.
3747080	3749080	All right, Somerville?
3749080	3753080	So, Dan Harmon was laying supine on the fork,
3753080	3755080	the fork, the folksill of the tour bus,
3755080	3757080	I don't know, the four room and the thing,
3757080	3760080	and there's a big couch, and he's reclined back there,
3760080	3762080	and we're all, you know, this is,
3762080	3764080	we were leaving Brooklyn last night
3764080	3765080	on a big high from the Brooklyn show,
3765080	3767080	which was immensely good last night,
3767080	3768080	and we're driving back.
3768080	3769080	Not as good as this.
3769080	3771080	No, no, no, this is fucking, this is way better.
3771080	3772080	Stage drive.
3772080	3773080	Stage drive.
3773080	3777080	I mean, later, in a couple minutes.
3777080	3778080	Yeah.
3778080	3781080	Can we get the biggest guys up front?
3781080	3783080	So, Dan was laying there,
3783080	3785080	and I started handing Dan various objects
3785080	3788080	because Dan expressed his desire to sing,
3788080	3791080	like, try his own hand that these improvised,
3791080	3792080	my dick is shaped like something else.
3792080	3794080	Yeah, I want to have fun with the dick songs.
3794080	3797080	So we tried, we tried the little honey bear thing,
3797080	3799080	we tried a honey bear dick, and I didn't go so well.
3799080	3800080	Honey bear dick.
3800080	3801080	Honey bear dick.
3801080	3803080	I got a honey, fuck it.
3803080	3805080	Aspirin dick was no good.
3805080	3806080	There was...
3806080	3809080	My Aspirin dick!
3809080	3810080	I can't do it, you know.
3810080	3811080	I think it was kind of failing.
3811080	3812080	Kept failing.
3812080	3813080	So, we found a kind of chicken,
3813080	3816080	a progressive chicken noodle soup, and...
3816080	3818080	He just kept swapping objects under my dick,
3818080	3821080	and, like, making me get out of my headspace.
3821080	3822080	He was like, he was like a,
3822080	3823080	you were like a great, like,
3823080	3825080	Iron Eagle's Lou Gossett Jr. like, mentor.
3826080	3827080	Just stop thinking about it.
3827080	3828080	Stop thinking about it.
3828080	3829080	And then finally, the last object was,
3829080	3831080	was a can of chicken noodle soup,
3831080	3834080	a big fat, progressive can of chicken noodle soup,
3834080	3835080	and I went,
3835080	3837080	Here I am!
3837080	3839080	And then we wrote this song from there.
3839080	3840080	And then it floundered, and we were like,
3840080	3841080	No, I don't.
3841080	3842080	But we could tell, like,
3842080	3844080	I got like a Tin Pan Alley songwriter,
3844080	3845080	so we do, there's a gem there.
3845080	3846080	There's a kernel.
3846080	3848080	Here I am!
3848080	3851080	I ain't got a dick, I got a chicken noodle can.
3851080	3853080	All my life!
3853080	3856080	I've been puttin' my hands in my chicken noodle wife.
3856080	3859080	Chicken noodle got come down from the mountains.
3859080	3861080	Chicken noodle man, you gotta work all day.
3861080	3864080	Chicken noodle man, you gotta cross the river Jordan.
3864080	3867080	Beat the devil's soup until your troubles go away.
3871080	3874080	It's, uh, it's a spiritual.
3874080	3876080	It is, I mean, for the lack of a better word,
3876080	3878080	it's a Negro spiritual about,
3878080	3881080	about God cursing you with that, with that,
3881080	3884080	with a strange dick and forcing you to work
3884080	3886080	your whole life and struggle.
3886080	3888080	It's about being gibbited by God.
3888080	3891080	Yes, but the payoff, the payoff is
3891080	3893080	the curse of this chicken noodle can,
3893080	3896080	you can feed the devil soup and make your troubles go away.
3896080	3899080	Yeah, yeah, it's like a hard workin' fuckin' life.
3899080	3902080	We should, if anyone out listening wants to remix that,
3902080	3905080	uh, put some, like, some acts, like some pics on the,
3905080	3907080	PINK! PINK! PINK!
3907080	3909080	Just give it one clean audio track,
3909080	3911080	let's do it one more time, like this.
3914080	3916080	Here I am!
3916080	3918080	I ain't got a dick, nigga, nigga, nigga.
3918080	3919080	You got a chicken noodle can.
3919080	3922080	Don't start clapping until chicken noodle God can.
3922080	3923080	I'll give you the cue for the clapping,
3923080	3924080	so it's gonna start out without the clapping.
3924080	3925080	I think it works better.
3925080	3927080	And then, and then you, sir, wear a diaper
3927080	3929080	and fly across with a banner.
3929080	3930080	No, no, no, let's not get to-
3930080	3932080	76 trombones, alright.
3932080	3934080	We need carat and castor design.
3934080	3935080	Okay.
3935080	3937080	Oh Jesus, I'm falling everywhere.
3937080	3938080	Okay, here we go.
3938080	3941080	One, two, one, two, three.
3941080	3942080	Here I am.
3942080	3943080	Oh Jesus.
3943080	3944080	Alright.
3944080	3945080	Fuck.
3946080	3948080	Here I am.
3948080	3949080	Uh, start over.
3949080	3950080	That was terrible.
3951080	3952080	Sorry.
3952080	3953080	It's gonna end up.
3953080	3955080	Here, here, here I am.
3955080	3956080	Stop it.
3957080	3960080	One, two, one, two, three, four.
3960080	3962080	Here I am.
3962080	3965080	I ain't got a dick, I got a chicken noodle can.
3965080	3968080	All my life, I've been puttin' again,
3968080	3970080	and my dick and noodle wife.
3970080	3972080	Chicken noodle, God, come down from the mountains.
3972080	3975080	Hey, chicken noodle, man, you gotta work all day.
3975080	3977080	Chicken noodle, man, you gotta cross the river, Jordan.
3977080	3980080	Feed the devil soup until your troubles go away.
3980080	3985080	Feed the devil soup until your troubles go away.
3985080	3986080	Yeah.
3989080	3992080	We can make some more verses to that, too, I think, as we go.
3992080	3994080	Yeah, I think the next verse has to be about
3994080	3995080	the chicken noodle wife.
3995080	3997080	I'm concerned about her.
3997080	3999080	Yeah, she's at home, like...
3999080	4002080	Keep gettin' fucked by a chicken noodle can.
4002080	4004080	That doesn't make me a chicken noodle wife.
4004080	4005080	I'm a person.
4005080	4007080	Yeah, he kinda acts like she's a big job for him.
4007080	4009080	Puttin' this can inside my chicken noodle wife.
4009080	4010080	Poor baby.
4010080	4011080	It's a very sexist song.
4011080	4012080	And also, all my life, you're like,
4012080	4013080	oh, really?
4013080	4014080	We met when you were 20.
4014080	4015080	It's like...
4015080	4018080	But, in his defense, he's probably, like,
4018080	4022080	building a lot of railroad and not for a lot of pay.
4023080	4026080	If shit rolls downhill a little bit to the woman he loves,
4026080	4030080	like, maybe there could be some support there.
4030080	4032080	Maybe she gets her own song.
4032080	4034080	Maybe she can be like a Dolly Parton figure and go like,
4034080	4037080	no, little girl, when you waitin' for your man to come home,
4037080	4040080	no, no, no, baby, no, no, no.
4040080	4043080	Ain't enough chicken noodle in the can for me.
4043080	4045080	Ain't that right?
4047080	4050080	You know, kind of rise up, sisters.
4051080	4052080	Put him in his place.
4052080	4054080	Yeah, if people feel that they have a verse, you know,
4054080	4058080	to add to that, you know, please, tumble that shit.
4058080	4059080	All right.
4059080	4061080	All right, can we do our regular segment?
4061080	4063080	I'm really convinced this is gonna pay off.
4063080	4067080	It's called Spencer's Complaints About Looney Tunes Cartoons.
4070080	4072080	Spencer is...
4072080	4074080	Spencer comes down, you think, you know,
4074080	4077080	that he'd have a softness in his heart
4077080	4078080	for the Looney Tunes characters,
4078080	4080080	but he really comes down like a ton of lead.
4080080	4081080	Yeah, yeah.
4081080	4082080	The more you find out about this guy,
4082080	4083080	the more you love him.
4083080	4084080	We took him to Charlotte.
4084080	4087080	He loved the sleep.
4087080	4088080	Then we took him to Times Square.
4088080	4090080	He hated, like, Times Square.
4090080	4092080	Like, and you go like, yeah, good.
4092080	4094080	Like, he's a...
4094080	4095080	He's a barometer.
4095080	4097080	He's like Henry David Thoreau.
4097080	4099080	And he's not falling for any of those
4099080	4101080	Tasmanian devil bullshit.
4101080	4104080	Sorry, some of you probably have a tattoo of him somewhere,
4104080	4107080	but all right, let's play a theme song.
4107080	4110080	Spencer's Complaints About Looney Tunes.
4110080	4111080	He hates it.
4111080	4114080	He hates Looney Tunes, period.
4114080	4117080	So, it was a good one, though.
4122080	4124080	Oh, we're the man.
4124080	4125080	You always got to dance.
4125080	4126080	You subjected your cartoons.
4126080	4127080	Oh, sorry.
4127080	4128080	No, dancing.
4128080	4131080	I was just commenting on your dancing.
4131080	4134080	All right, so do you want to team up with the question, Dan?
4134080	4135080	No, no, no.
4135080	4136080	No, no, no.
4136080	4137080	Okay, okay.
4137080	4138080	Wylie Coyote and the Road Runner.
4138080	4139080	Well, I like that.
4139080	4142080	That's like the one Looney Tunes I enjoy.
4142080	4144080	Well, don't talk about that.
4145080	4146080	No, but you...
4146080	4147080	Wait, do you guys like her?
4147080	4149080	I don't get it.
4149080	4152080	Honestly confused, not joking.
4152080	4154080	Anyway, Wylie Coyote...
4154080	4157080	I mean, he has, like, his dad's credit card.
4157080	4158080	I don't know.
4158080	4159080	Like, where does he get all the money
4159080	4161080	for the shit that he buys?
4161080	4163080	And not only, like, just crazy shit,
4163080	4166080	but, like, literally, like, surreal shit.
4166080	4170080	Like, a paint-your-own-hole-in-a-wall, like, kit.
4170080	4172080	But it's just like, does Acme not sell,
4172080	4174080	like, Rotisserie Road Runner?
4174080	4175080	Right.
4175080	4176080	Like, it's so easy.
4176080	4179080	He's spending millions of dollars.
4180080	4182080	I'm sure there's a restaurant.
4182080	4183080	All right, all right.
4183080	4185080	Spencer Hayes Looney Tunes.
4189080	4192080	Also, that track I just played is one minute
4192080	4193080	and 11 seconds.
4193080	4195080	You ended exactly on time.
4195080	4197080	I have great back timing.
4197080	4199080	Here I am.
4199080	4200080	Ain't gonna dick.
4200080	4201080	I'm gonna drink a noodle can.
4201080	4202080	Sorry.
4202080	4203080	I love it.
4203080	4206080	All right, should we start playing Dungeons and Dragons?
4206080	4207080	I think we should.
4209080	4211080	That's the first time that's been applauded
4211080	4212080	anywhere near Boston.
4212080	4216080	Like, we were in Brooklyn as a sold-out crowd.
4216080	4219080	It's like people are cheering for Ray of Frost spells.
4219080	4220080	All right, tell us...
4220080	4221080	What have we wrought?
4221080	4223080	We have to welcome Mulrancadonna Aaron McGathey
4223080	4224080	to the stage.
4226080	4227080	Hey.
4228080	4229080	Really quick.
4229080	4231080	Maybe this is just in my head.
4231080	4233080	But it feels like there have been a lot of references
4233080	4235080	to you getting blown and you getting laid.
4235080	4236080	No, no, no.
4236080	4238080	I just want to know if we're okay.
4238080	4239080	Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're fine.
4239080	4241080	I was actually specifically gonna do a relationship
4241080	4242080	check-in with you.
4242080	4243080	Oh, okay.
4243080	4244080	Well, then I'll save it.
4244080	4245080	Because...
4245080	4246080	Do that now.
4246080	4247080	Do it now.
4247080	4248080	Spencer, get your dice lined up
4248080	4250080	for whatever goes on over there.
4250080	4251080	How are we doing, baby?
4252080	4253080	Um...
4253080	4254080	I think we're doing good.
4254080	4255080	Yeah, no, the jokes about...
4255080	4259080	You know, Jeff's making jokes like somebody's blowing me.
4259080	4261080	Right, and then you said, like,
4261080	4262080	I won't get laid and...
4262080	4263080	Yeah, yeah.
4263080	4264080	Well...
4264080	4265080	I don't know.
4265080	4266080	No, it's fine.
4266080	4267080	Maybe you were talking about me.
4267080	4268080	Maybe you were worried about enticing me.
4268080	4269080	Yeah, yeah.
4269080	4270080	Aaron, Aaron, Aaron.
4270080	4271080	Cheap laughs.
4271080	4272080	Cheap laughs.
4272080	4274080	Aaron, it gets lonely for a guy on the road.
4274080	4275080	But he brought his girlfriend.
4275080	4277080	He brought his portable hole.
4281080	4283080	Do-it-yourself a hole kit.
4283080	4284080	Well, I would...
4284080	4290080	There's 850,000 reasons never to be in a relationship with me.
4290080	4294080	The only one that there isn't is that one I would ever...
4294080	4295080	I just don't...
4295080	4296080	I don't have the capacity.
4296080	4297080	No, I know, I know.
4297080	4298080	I've never done it.
4298080	4299080	I'm 40.
4299080	4300080	He's a great guy.
4300080	4301080	He's a great guy, everybody.
4301080	4302080	And a great boyfriend.
4302080	4303080	Great boyfriend.
4303080	4304080	I'm not...
4304080	4305080	Like, the road is hard for a relationship.
4305080	4307080	We're in a tour bus and we're in a hotel room,
4307080	4310080	and it's like, well, why aren't we doing it all the time?
4310080	4313080	We have sex with wood.
4313080	4315080	There's a wood block.
4315080	4317080	There's a hole on one side and then, like, a thing on the other.
4317080	4320080	And we have this, like, swing that we sit in.
4320080	4322080	And there's no time for it.
4322080	4324080	We're orthodox Amish.
4324080	4326080	We're not allowed to look at each other.
4326080	4328080	We have these Iron Man suits made of wood.
4328080	4330080	And I just have an opening for our dicks.
4330080	4332080	She has a dick.
4332080	4334080	And we just rub them together.
4334080	4336080	We're snails.
4336080	4339080	We're asexual wooden Iron Men.
4339080	4344080	I would say, mercifully, I have not caught or heard you guys doing it on the tour bus.
4344080	4345080	No, no, no, no, no.
4345080	4347080	It would be really hard to do on the tour bus.
4347080	4348080	Boo?
4348080	4349080	Hard and awesome.
4349080	4351080	Are you booing Jeff not seeing us have sex?
4351080	4353080	No, he's booing you guys not fucking on the tour bus.
4353080	4354080	There's these, like...
4354080	4356080	We've spooned.
4356080	4359080	Yeah, we cradle each other.
4359080	4363080	There's these little bunks and you draw a little curtain across.
4363080	4365080	Yeah, it would be...
4365080	4366080	It'd be weird.
4366080	4369080	You'd hear my belt buckle jingling.
4369080	4371080	Like...
4371080	4373080	It would be...
4373080	4374080	It wouldn't be real sex.
4374080	4376080	It would be like a hand job or something.
4376080	4379080	You'd just hear like jingling and...
4379080	4381080	Right, and I cry pretty loud.
4387080	4390080	Chicken noodle man.
4390080	4392080	I know why.
4392080	4394080	I'm working on it.
4396080	4398080	I'm going to write that female part,
4398080	4400080	and I'm going to create a fake Twitter account,
4400080	4401080	and I'll tweet it to you, and I'll be like,
4401080	4403080	ah, hasmatt45?
4403080	4404080	What a...
4404080	4406080	I don't know why that's my...
4406080	4408080	Hasmatt45.
4408080	4411080	Somebody's got some subconscious herpes denial.
4416080	4419080	No, no, any random jingling on that bus
4419080	4421080	is going to give me nightmares.
4421080	4424080	That's why I take off my belt in that bunk
4424080	4427080	because I don't want anyone to think I'm jerking off.
4427080	4430080	And it sounds like I'm jerking off.
4432080	4434080	Every time I roll over, it sounds like I'm jerking off.
4434080	4435080	Oh, man.
4435080	4437080	So have you jerked off on the bus?
4437080	4439080	Not on the bus.
4441080	4444080	What have you jerked off on?
4444080	4447080	I did in the hotel room.
4447080	4449080	Well, wish...
4449080	4451080	Wish I was around for that.
4451080	4454080	Well, you weren't. You were getting me food.
4458080	4460080	I'm not...
4460080	4462080	The title of tonight's show isn't,
4462080	4464080	I'm a good boyfriend, or I wouldn't have...
4464080	4467080	I'm not trying to pull anything over on anyone.
4467080	4469080	That's why I came back with the food,
4469080	4472080	and you were just asleep with a smile on your face.
4472080	4475080	No, I was just watching Harry Potter 2, and...
4475080	4478080	Oh, yeah, that gets me every time.
4478080	4482080	Oh, they're fighting the evil wizards.
4482080	4484080	No, I don't know. No, it wasn't...
4484080	4485080	No, it's okay.
4485080	4486080	It wasn't one of those moments that you're thinking.
4486080	4487080	It's okay, it's okay.
4487080	4489080	I was very discreet about it. You never knew.
4489080	4490080	You never suspected.
4490080	4493080	Aaron, have you masturbated on the bus?
4493080	4495080	Hesitation.
4503080	4506080	They're just like us.
4507080	4509080	They're like us.
4509080	4511080	They're just like us.
4511080	4513080	Yeah, you did it, didn't you?
4513080	4516080	Well, you know, God, this is such a big room.
4516080	4519080	Yes, yes, clearly I did it. Clearly I did it.
4521080	4524080	See, women get applause for that.
4524080	4527080	And this is how I get it. Dan, should I do it?
4527080	4528080	Sure, sure.
4528080	4530080	Oh, no, you're supposed to say it.
4531080	4533080	Dateline, tour bus.
4533080	4536080	My girlfriend masturbated in a bunk.
4537080	4542080	She's a woman of the people, having fun on the road,
4542080	4544080	getting it all out there.
4545080	4547080	I just did it to fall asleep a couple of times.
4547080	4550080	Yeah, that's why I always do it.
4551080	4554080	Yeah, well, whatever, it's fine.
4554080	4557080	This is a great time for me to point out that
4557080	4560080	I was a camp counselor for several years,
4560080	4563080	and one of my campers is here tonight.
4564080	4565080	Let's get her up here.
4565080	4568080	Emma, come on up.
4568080	4570080	I forgot about that.
4571080	4574080	Specific talk about bunk masturbation.
4574080	4577080	Yeah, your camp cattler was masturbated on the bus today.
4577080	4578080	Emma!
4578080	4580080	Emma Brooke, everybody. Hi.
4580080	4582080	Hello.
4583080	4584080	This is Emma.
4584080	4585080	Hey.
4586080	4587080	I can trump that.
4587080	4590080	The 19-year-old webmaster of my Tumblr blog is here.
4590080	4592080	Marissa, get up here.
4596080	4599080	It's a competition to make each other uncomfortable.
4601080	4603080	Let's get it all out.
4603080	4605080	It's weird going on tour.
4608080	4612080	Marissa runs the Having Change Tumblr blog.
4615080	4618080	If you bought Dan's book, when I was editing Dan's book,
4618080	4620080	Marissa helped me by...
4620080	4622080	I called her and asked a million things about her,
4622080	4624080	and she helped me by finding Tumblr dates and stuff.
4624080	4625080	Her name's in the book.
4625080	4628080	If you want her to sign your book, that's great.
4628080	4630080	And Emma is super smart and cool,
4630080	4632080	and I was her counselor when she was 14,
4632080	4634080	and I'm sorry I masturbated on the bus.
4634080	4636080	And Marissa brought her mom.
4636080	4639080	So, like, let's bring her up.
4640080	4643080	Marissa's mom. Where's Marissa's mom?
4646080	4650080	40-year-old man, drinking and talking about sex and masturbation.
4650080	4652080	Under-aged women on stage.
4652080	4654080	Everybody's having a good time.
4654080	4656080	Bring up the mom. Bring up the mom.
4656080	4657080	Bring up the mom.
4657080	4659080	Bring up the mom.
4662080	4664080	I'm so sorry, ma'am.
4664080	4666080	I am not sorry at all about this.
4666080	4667080	I'm so sorry.
4667080	4668080	I'm so sorry.
4668080	4669080	I'm so sorry.
4669080	4670080	I'm so sorry.
4670080	4671080	I'm so sorry.
4671080	4672080	I'm so sorry.
4672080	4673080	I'm so sorry.
4673080	4675080	I am not sorry at all about this.
4676080	4678080	What's your name?
4678080	4679080	Mitzi.
4679080	4680080	Mitzi? Okay.
4680080	4683080	And so, Marissa told me...
4683080	4685080	We did a little interview for the little movie we're making.
4685080	4686080	She said that you...
4686080	4688080	Because she needed to come here.
4688080	4690080	She can't... It's a club. It's 21 and over.
4690080	4692080	She needed a legal guardian to come.
4692080	4695080	So you listened for the first time to the podcast
4695080	4697080	of this guy she's a fan of.
4699080	4701080	What was your reaction?
4703080	4705080	I thought I was alone.
4706080	4707080	Did you masturbate?
4707080	4711080	Stop. Stop. Jeff. Jeff. Jeff.
4711080	4714080	No. Yeah. Everybody's have a good time.
4714080	4716080	Ask your moms if they masturbate.
4716080	4718080	In front of their daughters.
4719080	4722080	Insane. This is officially more insane than Brooklyn.
4723080	4725080	We have lost our minds.
4726080	4728080	You did it. Congratulations.
4728080	4735080	You gibbet people and you bring this out of us.
4735080	4737080	I don't know what happens in this.
4737080	4738080	I'm so sorry.
4739080	4741080	Yeah. Yankee suck, right?
4741080	4742080	Oh, Yankee suck.
4744080	4745080	Yes.
4745080	4746080	Now it's happening.
4750080	4752080	This is where we get stabbed.
4752080	4754080	The steering wheel came off.
4755080	4757080	How are you enjoying the show?
4757080	4759080	I'm absolutely loving it.
4759080	4764080	But I actually have a story about Aaron kind of related to masturbation.
4764080	4765080	Oh, no.
4775080	4776080	Just hanging out.
4776080	4781080	All right. Well, I doubt she has any recollection of this whatsoever.
4782080	4786080	But Aaron Aaron actually taught me.
4804080	4809080	Yeah. Aaron actually taught me what a feminine wetness was.
4812080	4816080	So we went to a very or the camp is very experimental.
4819080	4822080	What do you what's the address of this place?
4823080	4825080	It's in Maine. It's in Maine.
4826080	4829080	How did I teach you about feminine wetness?
4829080	4832080	Well, I remember we were all the hard way.
4842080	4846080	Well, do you remember when we used to like hang out on the porch of the bunk,
4846080	4850080	like kind of late at night, we'd talk about boys and men and
4851080	4852080	it was this feels terrible.
4852080	4854080	The podcast on a porch.
4854080	4855080	Yeah.
4855080	4858080	Very, very early incarnation of this feels terrible.
4858080	4862080	But we were like we were chilling out there as me and a few of my friends
4862080	4866080	and Aaron comes out and we're like, Aaron, what is wet mean?
4866080	4868080	Like, what does it mean when you get wet?
4868080	4873080	And she just got so uncomfortable and that's good.
4873080	4875080	I'm glad you didn't say a smile.
4875080	4877080	Whatever came across her face.
4877080	4888080	I thought you'd never ask cut to Cancun cut to a cartoon owl looking at the camera.
4892080	4894080	What did I say? Was it appropriate?
4894080	4896080	It was very clinical definition.
4896080	4904080	You're just like when a woman gets aroused, she, her vagina gets wet.
4906080	4907080	Say what?
4910080	4912080	You know, some day, some day.
4915080	4918080	All right. Okay. Well, thank you.
4919080	4920080	All right.
4921080	4923080	Well, we learned a lot.
4924080	4926080	Take your mamas, come on down.
4927080	4929080	Everybody's going to learn a thing or two.
4929080	4931080	Oh, how do you get wet?
4931080	4932080	What do you do?
4932080	4933080	Okay.
4933080	4934080	Jesus.
4934080	4935080	This is insane.
4937080	4939080	Are there any 14 year olds in the audience?
4941080	4943080	Can I get you another root beer float?
4944080	4946080	What do we do, Jeff?
4946080	4951080	We have a, we have a chorus of spiraling shame and irony up here.
4951080	4955080	What do we, what do we, Adam Goldberg's on the air again.
4956080	4958080	Knowing that his brothers are here.
4958080	4959080	He has a reply.
4959080	4960080	Yes.
4960080	4961080	What does Adam Goldberg have to say?
4961080	4963080	All right. Well, we need, we need you on mic though.
4963080	4965080	Let's just, let's, let's just have the, we'll go out there.
4965080	4967080	That'll be the, that'll be the stage.
4967080	4970080	We'll just, everyone at some point is going to get on the stage today.
4971080	4974080	But first of all, do you know how to get wet?
4976080	4978080	Okay. I'm sorry. That was too far.
4978080	4983080	Okay. Come on up so we can hear the, this, this, this, your, your Matt, right?
4983080	4984080	Yeah.
4984080	4985080	All right.
4985080	4987080	So you, you have a relationship with Adam Goldberg.
4987080	4989080	Yeah. I know him from the drive.
4989080	4990080	Right.
4990080	4991080	Just like you.
4991080	4992080	A bar in LA. Okay.
4992080	4994080	And so Adam Goldberg sent you a text.
4994080	4998080	He knew that his, his brothers are here and he has a reply for you.
4998080	4999080	Okay.
4999080	5001080	Do you want to read it or?
5001080	5002080	No, you read it.
5002080	5003080	All right.
5003080	5007080	If they are being mean to me, ask Dan how many cool, cool, cool t-shirts he sold.
5007080	5010080	What does he think that makes his fan art?
5010080	5014080	Who does he think that makes his fan art updates his Wiki and upvotes his one-on-one videos?
5014080	5017080	Sure as hell, ain't the Alison Breeze of the world.
5017080	5019080	I met her though.
5020080	5022080	Pause for gravity.
5022080	5024080	I met her though. She's super nice.
5024080	5026080	Look, I really.
5028080	5030080	Oh no, everybody's spiraling.
5031080	5034080	Look, I really hard went to care about how people view me.
5034080	5036080	I really do.
5036080	5040080	But I can't recapture the feathers from the pillowcase.
5040080	5043080	I can't make people like me if they honestly don't want to.
5043080	5045080	I can be a positive person.
5045080	5050080	The best version of my authentic self and continue to be humorous, honest and loving.
5050080	5054080	If some people think I'm a gremlin or a robot or a grim bot.
5055080	5058080	Well, that is the price of entering the public sphere.
5058080	5061080	We can't all be Johnny, you need us.
5062080	5063080	Wow.
5063080	5066080	Adam Goldberg dominates.
5066080	5069080	Wait, Adam Goldberg knows what Johnny Unitas is?
5072080	5076080	Well, he certainly spiked that one in the fucking end zone.
5076080	5077080	What's your name?
5077080	5079080	Matt, everybody. Thank you, Matt.
5079080	5080080	Thank you.
5080080	5082080	Jesus Christ.
5082080	5086080	So Adam thought that he was really thrown under the bus, which I don't think he was.
5087080	5090080	Will the court see a rejoinder here on earth?
5090080	5091080	Okay, all right.
5091080	5092080	Jesus Christ.
5092080	5093080	All right.
5093080	5094080	Come on up.
5095080	5096080	No, no, no, no.
5096080	5099080	I'm all for this stuff, Matt.
5099080	5100080	This is what I want.
5100080	5101080	We've gone off the rails on this.
5101080	5104080	I just want to remind the listeners that Missy Merce's mom is still on stage.
5104080	5105080	Yeah, yeah.
5105080	5109080	She's just standing with her hands folded in front of her.
5109080	5110080	She's very patient.
5110080	5112080	Best mom in the world.
5112080	5114080	You were rejoinder.
5114080	5115080	All right.
5115080	5116080	And your name is?
5116080	5118080	Oh, my name is Nick.
5118080	5119080	Okay.
5119080	5120080	You made it up.
5120080	5121080	Fake name.
5123080	5125080	It's NIC.
5126080	5127080	There's no K.
5129080	5130080	All right.
5130080	5133080	That doesn't make it less fake, but it makes it more fake.
5133080	5134080	Good.
5134080	5136080	My name is Bob Johnson.
5136080	5137080	That's a fake name.
5137080	5140080	No, it's spelled with a Q.
5141080	5143080	I think he was just handing you that it was fake.
5143080	5144080	He's like, yeah, it is fake.
5144080	5145080	Oh, okay.
5145080	5146080	Thank you, sweetie.
5146080	5147080	All right.
5147080	5148080	So, all right.
5148080	5149080	All right.
5149080	5150080	I'm going to think about this later.
5150080	5152080	What's the rejoinder?
5152080	5166080	My rejoinder would be how brilliant you are, but the only way I can...
5166080	5167080	No, don't boo him.
5167080	5168080	Don't boo him.
5168080	5169080	He's you.
5169080	5170080	He's me.
5170080	5172080	That means I have to leave.
5172080	5174080	They booed.
5174080	5175080	Thank you.
5175080	5176080	I agree.
5176080	5177080	I'm brilliant.
5177080	5178080	Worst rejoinder ever.
5178080	5180080	That's what they were booing.
5180080	5181080	All right.
5181080	5182080	All right.
5182080	5184080	We hit peak of...
5184080	5185080	Peak insanity?
5185080	5186080	Yes.
5186080	5187080	Yeah.
5187080	5189080	No, I think we're not even halfway home, baby.
5189080	5190080	You're right.
5190080	5194080	Peak insanity would be like, oh, my God, we're going to run out of insanity.
5194080	5196080	It's the opposite problem, right?
5196080	5200080	We've hit the point in Day of the Dead where the elevator's coming down.
5200080	5202080	The loading dock elevator.
5202080	5207080	Since we have this chorus of beautiful ladies up here, maybe we should try the song.
5207080	5210080	We'll teach them the lyrics.
5210080	5211080	Maybe...
5211080	5212080	I'm sorry.
5212080	5213080	What was your name on the end there?
5213080	5214080	Emma.
5214080	5215080	Emma.
5215080	5217080	You probably already know the lyrics to the anthem, right?
5217080	5218080	The Come On Down to Harmon Town.
5218080	5219080	Do you know?
5219080	5220080	Let's try it out.
5220080	5221080	Yeah.
5221080	5222080	I could probably...
5222080	5223080	Oh, shit.
5223080	5224080	Oh, shit.
5224080	5225080	Oh, shit.
5225080	5226080	I'm going to make it quick.
5226080	5227080	Can I just dance?
5227080	5229080	Then we've got to play D&D, yo.
5229080	5231080	Okay, yo, yo, I'll do some rapping.
5231080	5235080	Then she'll sing the Rihanna part and you'll be clapping in it.
5235080	5236080	My name is Dan Harmon.
5236080	5238080	I'm sorry about the show.
5238080	5241080	I try to do things by the cup, but sometimes it blows.
5241080	5244080	Came to Somerville trying to do something nice.
5244080	5248080	I'm sorry that I couldn't have a lot of ice, but I'm still an alcoholic.
5248080	5250080	I still like to drink.
5250080	5253080	I fucked your mom all up and down the kitchen sink.
5253080	5256080	Put a pussy in the drain and turned it on.
5256080	5259080	I saw your mama go down till the break of dawn.
5259080	5262080	Come on down to Harmon Town.
5262080	5265080	Turn that frown upside down.
5265080	5266080	Strength.
5266080	5267080	He is yellow.
5267080	5268080	Poop is brown.
5268080	5269080	Struggle.
5269080	5271080	Come on down to Harmon Town.
5271080	5272080	Speakers in front of me.
5272080	5274080	They look like demons inside.
5274080	5277080	I want to fuck your mama so hard she gets twice as wide.
5277080	5280080	I fuck your mama on every avenue.
5280080	5281080	I fucked your mama.
5281080	5284080	I'm so sorry about you being up here.
5284080	5285080	I'm so sorry.
5285080	5288080	There's a literal mama behind me.
5288080	5289080	It's very comfortable.
5289080	5290080	I don't mean it.
5290080	5292080	It's just an expression.
5292080	5293080	I'm so sorry.
5293080	5295080	Obama's recession.
5295080	5298080	Come on down to Harmon Town.
5298080	5299080	Politics.
5299080	5301080	Turn that frown upside down.
5301080	5302080	Fiscal cliff.
5302080	5303080	He is yellow.
5303080	5304080	Poop is brown.
5304080	5305080	Put your pants out.
5305080	5306080	See how it works.
5306080	5308080	Your ass crack is inside.
5308080	5309080	My ass crack.
5309080	5310080	Yeah.
5310080	5312080	Ass crack hanging out of the back.
5312080	5315080	That means I'm a working class person.
5315080	5319080	Like people from the city that liked Goodwill Hunt and Steeple.
5319080	5321080	Matt Damon likes them apples.
5321080	5324080	I think that screenplay was stinky-er than Crapples.
5324080	5327080	Don't go to a window and say, how do you like them?
5327080	5331080	Any normal person would say, that's fucking stupid.
5331080	5334080	Come on down to Harmon Town.
5334080	5337080	Turn that frown upside down.
5337080	5338080	Affleck.
5338080	5339080	He is yellow.
5339080	5340080	Poop is brown.
5340080	5341080	Duck.
5341080	5343080	Come on down to Harmon Town.
5343080	5344080	Gosh.
5344080	5345080	Thank you, ladies.
5345080	5346080	All right.
5346080	5348080	Emma, Missy, and Marissa.
5348080	5349080	That's how we get them.
5349080	5352080	Thank you.
5352080	5353080	Thank you, Missy.
5353080	5356080	Any other ladies have any questions about why you get wet?
5356080	5358080	Missy, I'm so sorry.
5358080	5360080	Also, who knew it was Missy?
5360080	5363080	She has a milk crate for a stare.
5363080	5367080	All she wanted to do was raise a good daughter.
5367080	5369080	What?
5369080	5376080	And she did everything right, and then completely out of her control, the internet was invented.
5376080	5377080	She had no choice.
5377080	5379080	She didn't get to sign off on that.
5379080	5382080	No one ever came to her home and said, should we have an internet?
5382080	5384080	Well, what's that?
5384080	5395080	It means that a gross, horrible, alcoholic, middle-aged man will be a part of your daughter's life.
5395080	5399080	The nays have it.
5399080	5400080	No, they don't.
5400080	5401080	You don't get to choose.
5401080	5403080	It's the internet.
5403080	5404080	But I will...
5404080	5407080	She's a good kid, and you've definitely done something right.
5407080	5412080	Because I met her for the first time tonight, and she survived the last year unscathed.
5412080	5413080	She's not a dirtbag.
5413080	5415080	No, she's a good kid.
5415080	5417080	She seems very intelligent, too.
5417080	5420080	So my takeaway is just keep me in a gross, creepy asshole.
5420080	5421080	Absolutely.
5421080	5423080	I'm making better women.
5423080	5424080	All right, Spencer, get us up to date.
5425080	5436080	When we last met, the trio had just been regrouping after collecting some treasure in a locker room of a great flying ship.
5436080	5441080	Ascending a magical pull, Sharpie saw a fighting force of dark stars, evil men.
5441080	5446080	Thinking quickly, the mage conjured a squid, crushing several of the minions.
5446080	5453080	The ship's pilot, the sinister Dave, played by Jason Sudeikis, leapt into action,
5453080	5458080	blinding, tripping, and flatulating on Quark in a flurry of humorous combat.
5458080	5464080	The two fought with knives, and after a ray of frost to the eye and a critical arrow, Dave was slain.
5464080	5468080	The pite-sized armored figure falls onto the floor with a clatter.
5468080	5472080	The dead squid dissolves into air, freeing the previously trapped crewmen.
5472080	5474080	They cower in fear.
5474080	5475080	Go!
5475080	5476080	All right.
5476080	5477080	We did it.
5477080	5478080	So we got these guys on the run now.
5478080	5479080	Yeah.
5479080	5480080	Yeah, so that guy's dead.
5480080	5481080	There's those three other guys.
5481080	5483080	They were, like, trapped under the thing.
5483080	5485080	They're not trapped, but they're just cowering in fear.
5485080	5486080	Are they armored?
5486080	5487080	Are they kind of innocent?
5487080	5489080	They're not wearing much of anything.
5489080	5491080	Like that whip guy.
5491080	5492080	Okay.
5492080	5493080	Listen to the podcast.
5493080	5494080	Throw on your weapons.
5494080	5496080	I'm saying to them, throw on your weapons.
5496080	5498080	They have no weapons.
5498080	5501080	I give them some weapons.
5503080	5505080	You give them some throwing knives?
5505080	5506080	Yeah, all right.
5506080	5507080	I give them some throwing knives.
5507080	5509080	Throw them down.
5510080	5511080	They do that.
5511080	5515080	I go and pick up my throwing knives, and I go, watch it.
5515080	5516080	Yeah.
5516080	5520080	How does that feel to be given weapons and then made to surrender them?
5520080	5521080	Not very well.
5521080	5522080	Yeah.
5522080	5523080	Say it again.
5523080	5525080	Not very well.
5525080	5526080	Say it louder.
5526080	5529080	I'm psychologically breaking you.
5529080	5532080	One of them breaks psychologically.
5532080	5536080	I drink his soul.
5536080	5539080	You gain three hit points.
5540080	5541080	Uh-oh.
5541080	5545080	I just went down an Elrond Hubbard road.
5545080	5548080	Just a metaphor for drug abuse or something.
5548080	5550080	I just found out a new way to...
5550080	5552080	We don't know what they want, right?
5552080	5553080	No.
5553080	5554080	No, you don't.
5554080	5555080	I use diplomacy.
5555080	5556080	Okay.
5556080	5557080	Sorry.
5557080	5560080	So what do you want to say?
5560080	5566080	I want to say sorry about everything, I think.
5566080	5567080	What's going on?
5567080	5568080	What are you doing under there?
5568080	5571080	I don't know how to drive the ship!
5571080	5573080	Oh shit, is the ship crashing?
5573080	5575080	You hear a voice come from the overhead.
5575080	5577080	Autopilot disengaged.
5577080	5579080	Uh-oh.
5579080	5582080	The steering wheel of the ship spins wildly to the right,
5582080	5584080	and countless alarms flash, disorienting you.
5584080	5585080	I run by...
5585080	5586080	I'm sorry.
5586080	5587080	I'm a ranger.
5587080	5589080	I know.
5589080	5590080	Okay.
5590080	5594080	Do rangers have pilot skills?
5594080	5596080	I run to the steering wheel and grab it.
5596080	5597080	You grab it.
5597080	5599080	Grab it.
5599080	5603080	It's very difficult to hold on to the terrible bulk of the wheel,
5603080	5605080	but you manage to write its course.
5605080	5607080	Hey, this thing's hard to hold.
5607080	5609080	You're stronger than me.
5609080	5610080	Okay.
5610080	5612080	Would I do better holding the wheel, Spencer?
5612080	5614080	I go and assist and try my luck at holding the wheel
5614080	5615080	and steadying the ship.
5615080	5618080	After it's already been steadied by Sharpie,
5618080	5622080	you find it very, very easy to hold it on a steady course.
5622080	5624080	However, you don't know where the ship's headed.
5624080	5626080	Where are there some maps in the other room?
5626080	5627080	That's true.
5627080	5629080	You left them there, I think.
5629080	5630080	Okay.
5630080	5631080	I run back to the other room.
5631080	5632080	It's safe going, right?
5632080	5633080	We killed everybody on board, right?
5633080	5634080	You're holding the wheel.
5634080	5635080	Oh, shit.
5635080	5636080	All right.
5636080	5637080	Hey.
5637080	5638080	Hey.
5638080	5639080	Hot Chat.
5639080	5640080	Go get those maps.
5640080	5641080	I'll drive.
5641080	5642080	Mollrein, go get the maps.
5642080	5645080	Are you going to jerk off again?
5645080	5646080	Because every time she leaves the room,
5646080	5648080	you start masturbating.
5648080	5651080	I'm going to use hypnotism to get some information out of these guys.
5651080	5653080	Okay.
5653080	5654080	All right.
5654080	5655080	So I'll go get the maps.
5655080	5656080	I'm sorry.
5656080	5657080	No, it's okay.
5657080	5664080	I bound away and my hair flows like a river of kisses,
5664080	5668080	and this scent comes from my hair that's like lilacs and heaven,
5668080	5670080	and I turn back and I giggle,
5670080	5672080	and then I walk into the other room.
5672080	5673080	Yep.
5676080	5678080	The sirens are still going off.
5678080	5681080	I look on the panel for anything that might indicate,
5681080	5685080	can I use my intelligence, my extreme Dan Harmon-type intelligence,
5685080	5687080	to determine if I could tell on this panel
5687080	5689080	if there's anything that'll shut these alarms off?
5689080	5690080	There's nothing that'll shut them off.
5690080	5694080	They seem to be indicating some sort of pressure regulation warnings.
5694080	5696080	Oh, is the hatch still open?
5696080	5697080	Maybe.
5698080	5699080	Which hatch?
5699080	5701080	The one I entered through from the bottom.
5701080	5702080	That one's not open.
5702080	5705080	What about the hatches where the cannons were?
5705080	5707080	Those were sealed.
5707080	5708080	Okay.
5708080	5709080	All right.
5709080	5710080	Fuck it.
5710080	5711080	Fuck that thing.
5712080	5716080	If I want to get information out of people as a sidebar,
5716080	5719080	is it better to use charm person or hypnotism?
5719080	5720080	I'd use charm person.
5720080	5721080	Okay.
5721080	5723080	I cast charm person on one person?
5723080	5725080	The guy who sold you broke.
5725080	5726080	Yeah, yeah.
5726080	5727080	That happens.
5727080	5728080	Okay.
5728080	5729080	Is he my buddy now?
5729080	5731080	He's feared of you, but yeah.
5731080	5732080	Yeah.
5732080	5734080	What's your name, buddy?
5734080	5735080	Clint.
5737080	5738080	Clint.
5739080	5741080	You're having a good time piloting the ship?
5741080	5742080	I'm in fear.
5742080	5743080	Yeah?
5743080	5744080	Me too, buddy.
5744080	5745080	We're all afraid.
5745080	5747080	Everyone's afraid of things they don't know,
5747080	5749080	but you know it always helps me when I'm afraid.
5749080	5753080	I figure out everything I can about what I do know.
5753080	5754080	Where's the ship?
5754080	5755080	Where was the ship going?
5755080	5759080	I was going to the north to regroup.
5760080	5761080	Okay.
5761080	5763080	With them.
5763080	5764080	You know what doesn't help fear?
5764080	5765080	What?
5765080	5766080	What?
5767080	5768080	You know what?
5768080	5770080	You know what always cuts through it?
5770080	5772080	Specificity.
5773080	5775080	Like coordinates.
5775080	5776080	Like names.
5776080	5781080	I don't have the education to understand such coordinate systems.
5781080	5785080	Do you have the education to understand that I will fuck your world up?
5785080	5787080	I thought we were friends?
5787080	5788080	Yeah.
5788080	5790080	A good friend will fuck you up.
5790080	5792080	He's broken again.
5792080	5797080	Sharpie, ask him if he knows how to get the pressure systems back to normal.
5797080	5799080	How do you get the pressure systems going, Clint?
5799080	5800080	He's bawling on the floor.
5800080	5801080	Clint?
5801080	5802080	Clint?
5802080	5803080	Look at me.
5803080	5804080	Look at me.
5804080	5807080	I step in and play good cop.
5807080	5809080	I said, listen, sorry about my friend, man.
5809080	5810080	I want a piece of that asshole.
5810080	5812080	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
5812080	5817080	Sharpie, go get a cup of decaf and I'll just take it easy.
5817080	5820080	I'll be back and then you're fucking dead, Clint.
5821080	5822080	Clint, I'm sorry about my partner.
5822080	5826080	His wife just was killed by a cabinet.
5826080	5829080	An animated cabinet.
5829080	5830080	Stupid presidents.
5830080	5832080	Why do they appoint those people?
5832080	5834080	They're murderers.
5834080	5839080	Clint, look, man, you've been nothing but doing us favors.
5839080	5842080	Do you know how to repressurize the ship?
5842080	5845080	You need to find one of those little black creatures.
5845080	5847080	They know how this thing works.
5847080	5848080	Don't be racist.
5848080	5849080	Okay, weird story.
5849080	5851080	I'm sorry, they're called imps.
5851080	5852080	Imps?
5852080	5853080	Imps.
5853080	5854080	IMP.
5854080	5857080	I do know how to spell various creatures' names.
5857080	5858080	Okay.
5858080	5861080	What deck and how do I get to these knowledgeable imps?
5861080	5863080	They might be in the engine room.
5863080	5864080	All right.
5864080	5865080	I run off to the engine room.
5865080	5867080	You head down the ladder into the engine room.
5867080	5868080	Can I see anything out of the...
5868080	5869080	Is there a windshield?
5869080	5870080	Yeah, there is a windshield.
5870080	5871080	Do I see the other ships?
5871080	5872080	Is there like a fleet of ships?
5872080	5873080	There's actually not.
5873080	5875080	You can't see any ships around you.
5875080	5877080	You find that slightly odd, to be honest.
5877080	5878080	Yeah, we've deviated.
5878080	5879080	Yeah.
5879080	5880080	You're telling me.
5880080	5883080	I should mention that Quark stepped away from the wheel.
5883080	5884080	What?
5884080	5886080	The Quark stepped away from the wheel.
5886080	5887080	Oh.
5887080	5888080	Grab the wheel.
5888080	5889080	Shit, I grab it.
5889080	5890080	I grab it.
5890080	5892080	You don't hear him because he's in the engine room at this point.
5892080	5896080	I climb back up the ladder and yell, sorry, my bad.
5896080	5897080	Grab the wheel, Sharpie.
5897080	5898080	All right.
5898080	5899080	All right.
5899080	5900080	That happens.
5900080	5901080	I come running back into the room.
5901080	5902080	Yeah.
5902080	5904080	How does your hair look?
5904080	5905080	Oh.
5905080	5906080	Oh, you did?
5906080	5907080	Oh, wow.
5907080	5908080	You did something new with it.
5908080	5910080	Does that smell like bangs?
5910080	5913080	Bangs or rainbows, you tell me.
5913080	5914080	Yes.
5914080	5920080	My hair is flowing and my breasts, they're slow motion almost.
5920080	5925080	I go back into the engine room.
5925080	5926080	Sharpie.
5926080	5927080	Yes.
5927080	5929080	Here are the maps.
5929080	5930080	Thank you.
5930080	5931080	You're welcome.
5931080	5941080	There's a musical sting indicating that, you know, I too know what it is to be wet.
5941080	5953080	Well, I came into the room with my hair down to here.
5953080	5955080	It looked into.
5955080	5959080	We don't have time for that.
5959080	5963080	Here are the maps, and as a ranger, I know that we need to go north.
5963080	5966080	Also, I overheard you should go north.
5966080	5967080	Yeah, yeah, for sure.
5967080	5969080	I just got to keep this wheel straight.
5969080	5970080	Sharpie.
5970080	5974080	Sharpie, you got some squid glue on your shirt.
5974080	5976080	Oh, get that off.
5976080	5979080	Oh, thank you.
5979080	5980080	You're such a mess.
5980080	5985080	Listen, make sure those three guys don't move, you know, secure them somehow.
5985080	5986080	Okay.
5986080	5990080	I fire two arrows.
5990080	5991080	Jesus Christ.
5991080	5993080	We might need these guys.
5993080	5995080	These are not foes right now.
5995080	5996080	No, no, no.
5996080	5998080	I shoot it at their...
5998080	6002080	Is there any part of your body that's not painful to get shot with an arrow?
6002080	6004080	I shoot it at their hair.
6004080	6005080	Oh, okay.
6005080	6006080	Their earlobes?
6006080	6007080	Yeah.
6007080	6009080	Oh, they all have earrings.
6009080	6010080	Shoot through there.
6010080	6014080	Well, one of them hits the guy in the eye.
6014080	6015080	Terrific.
6015080	6016080	I might have needed him.
6016080	6017080	Might have needed him.
6017080	6018080	The other hits you in the foot.
6018080	6019080	Still there.
6019080	6020080	Okay.
6020080	6021080	And you take...
6021080	6022080	Ah, adventure.
6022080	6023080	One damage.
6023080	6024080	Jesus.
6024080	6026080	I'm sorry.
6026080	6029080	I've been very distracted lately.
6029080	6031080	Just keep an eye on them.
6031080	6034080	Well, I'll take one away, apparently.
6034080	6036080	Meanwhile, in the engine room...
6036080	6037080	I was just going to do that.
6037080	6038080	Yeah, good.
6038080	6039080	Yeah.
6039080	6041080	I examine the surroundings in the engine room.
6041080	6042080	Whoosh.
6042080	6043080	The engine room slides open.
6043080	6048080	You see eight identical machine-like machines.
6048080	6052080	They have some vaguely machine-like qualities.
6052080	6055080	Pistons firing and tubes going to and fro.
6055080	6059080	You see several fluids pumped through the various devices.
6059080	6061080	You can see one off in the corner.
6061080	6063080	It's venting a strange green gas,
6063080	6066080	and you can see two black creatures crawling across it,
6066080	6068080	hitting it with metal tools.
6071080	6072080	Guys, what's going on in here?
6072080	6074080	They hiss at you in a language you don't understand.
6079080	6081080	Did somebody feed you after midnight?
6083080	6084080	Or get you wet?
6087080	6088080	A chatter room there.
6090080	6091080	What did you say, a chatter room?
6091080	6093080	Yeah, I cast magic callback.
6096080	6097080	Do I need to...
6098080	6102080	I approach them to examine the machinery.
6102080	6104080	There's a large crack in one of the casings.
6104080	6106080	That's why it's venting gas.
6106080	6107080	You're not sure what this stuff is.
6107080	6109080	Are they trying to fix it or to destroy it?
6109080	6111080	They do appear to be trying to fix it.
6115080	6117080	So I should leave them to their task, probably, right?
6117080	6118080	Maybe.
6118080	6119080	Maybe they won't fix it.
6119080	6120080	I don't know.
6122080	6124080	Anybody out there got any ideas?
6125080	6126080	Whip one at a wall.
6127080	6128080	Whip one at a wall?
6129080	6131080	I take one of them and whip them at a wall.
6132080	6135080	I pick them up with my strength and throw one at the wall
6135080	6139080	to send a message to the other one to get on the fucking stick
6140080	6142080	and stop the gas leak.
6150080	6153080	He falls to the ground and is unconscious.
6154080	6156080	And I look at the other guy and I'm like,
6157080	6158080	The other guy's not paying attention.
6158080	6161080	He's going back to trying to work on this thing.
6162080	6163080	I go and assist him.
6164080	6165080	Okay.
6165080	6167080	I mean, he seems like he's doing his job, right?
6167080	6169080	He asks for some tears.
6172080	6175080	He looks at you expectantly and hiss is something at you.
6177080	6180080	Do I have any ability to understand him or...
6181080	6182080	I speak that language.
6183080	6186080	You know, I run back upstairs, grab the wheel at the bridge,
6187080	6189080	relieve Sharpie, he goes back down into the engine room.
6189080	6190080	You tag out.
6191080	6192080	Goldberg style.
6192080	6193080	Yeah.
6193080	6194080	Go.
6194080	6195080	All right.
6195080	6196080	I go to the room.
6196080	6198080	I carefully follow Jeff's directions.
6199080	6200080	Go left.
6200080	6201080	Keep going.
6201080	6202080	If you go to the bathroom, you go too far.
6202080	6203080	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6203080	6206080	Pass the unconscious imp laying below the wall.
6207080	6210080	The other imp is hissing about how this was a two person job.
6218080	6220080	Well, now it's a one person job.
6220080	6221080	How do we do it?
6221080	6222080	What can I do?
6222080	6223080	I'm a wizard.
6227080	6228080	Well, you speak the language.
6228080	6229080	Yeah.
6229080	6230080	Yeah.
6230080	6231080	You speak the language.
6231080	6232080	What are they saying?
6232080	6233080	I need sovereign glue.
6234080	6236080	Well, this is hardly the time.
6237080	6238080	This is exactly the time.
6238080	6239080	Oh, okay.
6239080	6240080	I'm sorry.
6240080	6241080	I was doing a dumb joke.
6243080	6248080	Is the sovereign glue that big glob of glowing jello
6248080	6250080	that was in the other room with the face bubbling up to it?
6251080	6253080	You don't know that it's not.
6256080	6257080	What does sovereign glue look like?
6258080	6259080	It comes in a yellow bottle.
6261080	6262080	It's usually well labeled.
6262080	6263080	It's not all that bad.
6264080	6265080	It should be in the locker room.
6266080	6268080	Didn't we get everything out of the locker room?
6268080	6269080	You got all the treasure.
6269080	6270080	Ah.
6271080	6273080	I go to the locker room.
6274080	6275080	You go to the locker room.
6275080	6276080	I find that yellow glue.
6276080	6277080	You do.
6277080	6278080	You find it.
6283080	6285080	Applause bigger than warranted.
6286080	6289080	Well, when you look at it, they're like, finish it.
6290080	6292080	The babysitter's getting extra.
6293080	6294080	All right.
6294080	6296080	I take the yellow glue back to the engine room.
6296080	6297080	That happens.
6297080	6299080	You give him the yellow glue and he sets to work.
6299080	6301080	He says, it should be about five minutes.
6301080	6302080	I think I got this.
6302080	6303080	Five minutes?
6303080	6304080	Yeah.
6304080	6305080	Thanks, Sam.
6305080	6306080	You know what?
6306080	6307080	You're a good imp.
6308080	6312080	I could see you retiring one day with a happy imp family,
6312080	6314080	but I guess that's not how impage works.
6314080	6315080	No, it's not.
6318080	6319080	All right.
6319080	6320080	Good day.
6320080	6322080	I go back up to the bridge.
6322080	6326080	As you go back up to the bridge, you can't help but flash back.
6328080	6330080	You flash back to your mother's tails.
6333080	6338080	Son, don't forget the infinite fish who will eat you up at night.
6338080	6343080	He'll fly past the moon in your window and eat you with a bite.
6343080	6345080	Oh, that terrible infinite fish.
6345080	6347080	He'll give you such a fright.
6348080	6351080	That's the last thing you think of before you hear an earth shattering impact on
6351080	6352080	the whole.
6352080	6353080	Everything goes black.
6353080	6354080	Cliffhanger.
6354080	6355080	Cliffhanger.
6355080	6356080	Cliffhanger.
6356080	6357080	Cliffhanger.
6360080	6363080	It's hip.
6363080	6364080	It's cool.
6364080	6367080	It's the coolest thing in the world.
6367080	6370080	It's my final revenge on the cool population.
6370080	6373080	I have made Dungeons and Dragons cool.
6373080	6375080	One more time for Aaron McGaffey.
6378080	6379080	And Spencer Crittenden.
6384080	6388080	And a fine fuck you to my gym teachers throughout the years.
6389080	6391080	Turns out this is a fine way to pass the time.
6392080	6395080	Have yet to earn money doing a pull up.
6396080	6401080	Having a pretty good time playing Dungeons and Dragons, Mr. Reiner.
6402080	6404080	All right, well let's...
6405080	6408080	I think we can bring this train out of the station.
6408080	6409080	Of course, of course.
6409080	6410080	What have we learned tonight?
6410080	6411080	It's Summerville.
6411080	6416080	Hey, let's get out of here before it's Fallville.
6417080	6419080	But they spell it with S-O-L-L.
6420080	6421080	Hey.
6421080	6423080	Why is it S-O-M-M?
6423080	6424080	Anybody know?
6424080	6425080	Somebody's name?
6425080	6426080	They made it up.
6426080	6427080	That's what I was saying.
6427080	6428080	They made it up at a town meeting.
6428080	6429080	No one knows why.
6429080	6432080	It's just because this Wahlberg guy was a fucking...
6432080	6433080	Sheepfucker.
6433080	6434080	He was a sheepfucker.
6437080	6438080	How many vacles did you get through up here?
6438080	6439080	Did you do them all?
6439080	6440080	You finished mine, by the way.
6440080	6442080	I can't tell because I kept marrying them.
6442080	6443080	That's the danger.
6443080	6445080	If we had a fifth up here, then we could monitor it.
6445080	6446080	Where the fuck's Matt?
6446080	6447080	We paid him enough.
6447080	6448080	No, no, no.
6448080	6449080	Matt didn't do anything wrong.
6449080	6453080	There's just a bunch of empty glasses and I'm happy.
6453080	6454080	I can measure it in happiness.
6454080	6455080	I'm very happy.
6456080	6457080	I've had a good time in Somerville.
6457080	6458080	Anybody that...
6459080	6464080	Aaron told me that you guys set a record that we didn't know was set-able
6464080	6468080	for a pre-show sale of merchandise.
6468080	6472080	I guess you guys bought the most shit before the show.
6473080	6475080	But can they go for the total?
6475080	6476080	That's not why we're here.
6476080	6478080	I'm taking a loss on the tour.
6478080	6481080	I'm doing this to indulge my own 40-year-old fantasies.
6482080	6484080	We're not a profiteering people.
6485080	6486080	We're just coming through town.
6486080	6489080	But we do have t-shirts and maps and photos and whatever the hell.
6489080	6491080	I don't know, glow worms, whatever the fuck.
6491080	6495080	And the I Love Spencer pin where the heart is a 20-sided die, which is awesome.
6496080	6498080	And if you buy that stuff, I'm happy to sign it.
6498080	6505080	I can't turn anybody down, so I'll be here all night until the last thing is signed.
6505080	6508080	Do you think it's possible to do audience passing with tables in here?
6508080	6509080	Is that really reckless?
6509080	6510080	I don't know, man.
6510080	6513080	That would be the ultimate fuck you to Brooklyn.
6513080	6516080	Yeah, if we could somehow manage.
6520080	6522080	Just going to make sure my wallet and my phone.
6530080	6531080	Find your center first, man.
6531080	6533080	Thank you, Somerville.
6533080	6536080	This is about what Somerville means to us.
6536080	6538080	Where are we in our tour?
6539080	6542080	There are four seasons in the year.
6542080	6548080	But the most special one is right here in Somerville.
6549080	6554080	It's where I wanted to kill up on the stage and I did all right.
6554080	6557080	And I think we all had a halfway decent night.
6557080	6565080	And I don't know what you paid, but I think we're going to be all right in Somerville.
6566080	6567080	I fucked your mama.
6567080	6569080	She was on the pill.
6569080	6576080	She didn't get pregnant, so I will not have a child with her.
6576080	6579080	But if I did, I'd raise it like Raymond Burr.
6579080	6586080	I'd teach him to be Perry Mason, and he'd solve cases on TV with hastened justice.
6586080	6593080	He'd cross-examine people and get to the bottom of shit in Harmon Town.
6594080	6596080	Harmon Town.
6596080	6597080	Sing it.
6597080	6601080	Harmon Town.
6601080	6603080	Harmon Town.
6603080	6605080	We're making it up.
6605080	6607080	I don't know.
6607080	6609080	We're making it up.
6609080	6611080	I fucked your mama.
6611080	6613080	I fucked your mama.
6613080	6615080	I fucked your mama.
6615080	6616080	I fucked your mama.
6616080	6617080	Hold on.
6617080	6618080	I'll get it together.
6618080	6619080	Don't worry about it.
6619080	6620080	I fucked your mama tonight.
6620080	6623080	I went to your mama's house.
6623080	6627080	I rang the doorbell and said, hello.
6627080	6634080	She said, come inside of my house and have some ambrosia salad with jello.
6634080	6636080	I laid down on the table.
6636080	6638080	It got so nasty.
6638080	6639080	She poured it over me.
6639080	6641080	I didn't care.
6641080	6646080	I fucked your mama so hard that I changed the color of her hair.
6646080	6648080	I went out in Harmon Town.
6648080	6650080	Harmon Town.
6650080	6652080	Harmon Town.
6652080	6655080	I fucked your mama in Harmon Town.
6655080	6658080	Where he is yellow and who is brown?
6658080	6662080	I fucked your mama so hard that Harmon Town.
6662080	6664080	All right, get the biggest people to the forward.
6664080	6665080	Get the biggest.
6665080	6666080	Yeah.
6666080	6667080	We can do it.
6667080	6668080	Yeah.
6668080	6669080	We can.
6669080	6670080	Oh, my God.
6670080	6671080	We're doing it.
6671080	6672080	We're tapping.
6672080	6674080	Yeah.
6674080	6675080	I fucked your mama tonight.
6675080	6681080	I fucked your mama in Somerville and I'm lifting even higher than Brooklyn still.
6681080	6685080	I'm touching the ceiling in Johnny Dees in Somerville.
6685080	6687080	That's a new record.
6687080	6690080	We're here in Harmon Town.
6690080	6694080	Thank you so much, Johnny Dees, for coming tonight.
6694080	6696080	I want to thank Cara.
6696080	6697080	Thank you.
6697080	6703080	Cara, the Goldberg brothers, Emma, Marissa, and Mitzi for coming up here.
6703080	6705080	A special thanks to Mitzi.
6705080	6706080	Really.
6706080	6709080	Special thanks for securing our children's future.
6709080	6714080	One more time for Spencer.
6714080	6715080	Aaron.
6715080	6717080	Thank you, Aaron.
6717080	6719080	I'm Jeff Davis.
6719080	6732080	Let's hear one more time for the mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.
6732080	6761080	Let's all go to the bar and get fucked up.
6762080	6764080	Thank you.
