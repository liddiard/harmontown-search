0	3720	He wasn't ready, now he wants an alibi
3720	6320	He's got a steady job, he's never gonna lie
6320	12200	From Hollywood, California, in the back wheel of Meltdown Comics, Harman Town is now in session!
12200	15120	Yeah, I'm so excited to turn this session on!
15120	16240	Oh, yeah!
16240	18960	I'm so excited to turn this session on!
18960	22480	Yeah, I'm so excited to turn this session on!
22480	25680	Let's bring out somebody near and dear to my heart, Mrs. Spencer Crittenden.
25680	32680	Oh, yeah!
32680	46680	And the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman!
46680	47680	Thank you very much.
47680	48680	Thank you.
48680	49680	Thank you.
49680	50680	Thank you.
51680	53680	And thank you.
53680	54680	Thank you.
54680	55680	Thank you.
55680	57680	You seem very coxier tonight.
57680	60680	Nah, I'm a little high.
60680	62680	I'll be honest with you.
62680	65680	What flavor of narcotics are you on tonight, just weed or what?
65680	69680	Strawberry cough, I think it's called, I don't know.
69680	70680	Sativa.
70680	73680	I'm not, I'm just, don't make that my gimmick.
73680	76680	Make that society's gimmick.
76680	79680	Legolasit!
79680	85680	All right, Nancy Reagan died.
85680	87680	Maybe that's why I got so high before the show.
87680	94680	I was like, I feel like, I feel like a ghost finally stopped telling me to say no to things.
94680	96680	Maybe I...
96680	98680	Did you write that joke down, was that prepared?
98680	100680	No, I just made the connection.
100680	102680	I came out, I followed, I told them I'm high.
102680	104680	They're gonna know sooner or later that I'm high.
104680	107680	And then I was like, I got one thing to talk, Nancy Reagan died.
107680	111680	So early you just said yes, I don't know.
111680	113680	But then, yeah, I'm like, okay.
113680	115680	It's not like you've been saying no your whole life.
115680	119680	No, I haven't, but yet a floodgate did open more, yeah, right?
119680	121680	Maybe that's what happened.
121680	126680	All right, so Nancy Reagan, 94 years old, rich.
126680	132680	So you're saying foul play.
132680	135680	The curse of the first ladies.
135680	137680	That they all died?
137680	143680	All of these women married first men, all of them are dropping away.
143680	144680	And they're 90 years.
144680	147680	Year by year, Norma Taft.
147680	158680	You know, you want to be a great serial killer, kill people who are 94.
158680	162680	There was, you know, famous people die.
162680	173680	I was just saying, famous people, they die as often, if not more than the obscure.
173680	174680	They die less.
174680	175680	That's the point of being famous.
175680	176680	They're rare.
176680	177680	They die less?
177680	178680	They're rare people.
178680	180680	Famous people die less than non-famous people.
180680	187680	I thought it was closer to a one-to-one ratio.
187680	193680	A room full of 100 people, less of them that die will be famous.
193680	195680	Well, because they're less famous people.
195680	196680	Exactly.
196680	197680	That's the point I was trying to make.
197680	198680	Okay, I dig it.
198680	199680	All right.
199680	201680	There are less famous deaths than obscure deaths.
201680	203680	We just know about the famous ones.
203680	207680	Right.
207680	210680	Man, you're blowing my mind right now.
210680	213680	I really did think that was an awesome mind blowing quote.
213680	217680	I picture that as being like Yogi Berra or Mark Twain on a calendar.
217680	219680	There are less famous deaths than obscure ones.
219680	221680	We just know about the latter.
221680	222680	I can't get it back.
222680	223680	I can't get it back.
223680	225680	I thought I did something amazing.
225680	228680	I want you to smoke more strawberry coffee before every show.
228680	229680	Nancy Reagan.
229680	232680	Charm, grace, and a passion for America.
232680	235680	A lot of the headlines were like, this elegant suave.
235680	236680	Like, I don't know.
236680	238680	Someone class and, like, I don't know.
238680	242680	They're just praising her dress.
242680	245680	There's a lot of people saying she dressed nice.
245680	247680	She wore that red dress all the time.
247680	248680	And then it's hard.
248680	249680	It's like, well, okay.
249680	254680	There's the kind of USA Today article.
254680	256680	Everybody kind of chimes in.
256680	262680	And you have people, like, for instance, let's see, like Obama.
262680	264680	He's got to, of course, he's got to say something.
264680	268680	He said, our former first lady redefined the role in her time here,
268680	270680	President Obama said in the statement.
270680	273680	Later, in her long goodbye with President Reagan,
273680	275680	she became a voice on behalf of millions of families, blah, blah, blah.
275680	278680	So people are like, you know, like, they're like,
278680	279680	what did she contribute?
279680	282680	Let's eulogize her, blah, blah, blah.
282680	284680	See him scrolling down.
284680	289680	Mitt Romney said, yeah, well, he kind of,
289680	291680	he said something kind of dickish, too,
291680	295680	that'll undercut my punchline, which is Trump.
295680	297680	But it's like everybody from Republicans to Democrats
297680	298680	and everyone in between.
298680	302680	People that lost their election, like Jimmy Carter had to say something.
302680	308680	And he said, Mrs. Reagan's Just Say No program prevented many young people
308680	310680	from falling prey to the allure of drug use.
310680	314680	She started a phony war on drugs.
314680	317680	Just put a bunch of people in prison for no goddamn reason.
317680	325680	But just confine this to the box of how to do a eulogy.
326680	328680	Just for a second, then we'll get to all that stuff.
328680	329680	That was mine.
329680	332680	So it's just paragraph after paragraph after paragraph.
332680	334680	It's like Jim Henson said this.
334680	335680	Jimmy Carter said that.
335680	337680	It's just like, oh, what's he going to say?
337680	343680	She was like a muppet of people.
343680	346680	But it's just like people largely get to, like, Obama had a really nice story.
346680	349680	I think I read the wrong paragraph where he really kind of nailed it the most
349680	351680	because he really did.
352680	354680	It's hard to move into the White House.
354680	359680	And she gave Michelle Obama kind of like a tutorial in it.
362680	363680	Focusing on her.
363680	370680	Donald Trump called Mrs. Reagan the wife of a truly great president.
370680	371680	That's it.
371680	373680	That's the end of my story.
373680	376680	And people say he's a misogynist.
376680	377680	But listen to that.
377680	378680	Listen to that.
378680	380680	How much he loves women in that quote.
381680	383680	What a fucking cunt.
386680	388680	He can't do anything I like.
391680	393680	It's kind of magical because he's that.
393680	398680	He just, every time he says something, I fucking want to just hit you in the face.
398680	403680	The wife of a truly great president and an amazing, amazing woman.
403680	405680	She really, really, really great.
405680	406680	No, it's true.
407680	408680	It's true.
409680	413680	Well, Ted Cruz said she will be remembered for her deep passion for this nation
413680	415680	and love for her husband.
415680	419680	I mean, of course, well, you know, she'll be remembered for her love of her husband.
419680	421680	That's because her husband will be remembered.
421680	426680	She did take care of a deeply, like, senile, demented old dude for, like, a long time.
426680	427680	And she was very cool about that.
427680	429680	It was really weird today on CNN.
429680	431680	I turned the TV on for a moment today.
431680	436680	And Anderson Cooper was talking to his mom, Gloria fucking Vanderbilt.
436680	438680	That's fucking weird, too.
438680	439680	What?
439680	440680	His mom's Gloria Vanderbilt, if I'm not mistaken.
440680	444680	And so they interviewed her because she and Nancy were, like, apparently boozing buddies.
444680	446680	Like, they were really good friends.
446680	450680	And so he's talking to Gloria Vanderbilt on the phone.
450680	456680	And Anderson Cooper, news anchor, he kept calling her mom.
456680	459680	He was like, this is the worst news show in the world.
460680	462680	Talking to your mom.
462680	464680	That sounds adorable, though.
464680	468680	I mean, she actually eulogized Nancy quite well because there were pals.
468680	469680	But here's the thing.
469680	472680	Like, so Nancy Reagan, you think, well, you guys don't think.
472680	475680	Some of you think, I don't know, like, Norma Taft.
475680	478680	But I was a child of the 80s.
478680	480680	Nancy Reagan sat on Mr. T's lap.
480680	482680	Nancy Reagan was the just-say-no lady.
482680	484680	Nancy Reagan was the, why can't I speak?
484680	486680	Because I'm high.
486680	488680	Nancy Reagan was on different strokes.
488680	490680	And she had a little gimmick.
490680	492680	And she was like, she was Nancy Reagan.
492680	494680	But...
494680	496680	Did she do a little dance?
496680	498680	She would, you know.
498680	500680	It's just like they would trot her out.
500680	502680	And she'd be like, I'm here with Knight Rider.
502680	505680	Knight Rider can say words that cars can't.
505680	507680	I.E. all of them.
507680	509680	But there's only one word your car needs to know.
509680	513680	And that's no to drugs.
513680	516680	Because my administration marks the beginning of a concept
516680	519680	where you take, like, for instance, crack cocaine,
519680	523680	and you say you get ten years in jail for the weight of crack cocaine
523680	526680	that you would get, like, a thousand years.
526680	530680	Anyways, it was, there was a lot of shit.
530680	532680	So you see people tweeting.
532680	534680	And you go, like, why are we eulogizing this person?
534680	536680	I count myself among that.
536680	538680	It's like, come on.
538680	539680	Don Knotts dies.
539680	541680	And you go, look, a lot of people are dying.
541680	542680	Don Knotts died.
542680	544680	And he was in the show.
544680	547680	Goodbye, Don Knotts.
547680	550680	If a president dies, and you go, like, ah, well,
550680	554680	I remember that time in my life that he was president of it.
554680	556680	OK.
556680	558680	Net, net, net, net zero.
558680	561680	Like, probably, I don't know, positive memories and negative,
561680	562680	whatever.
562680	563680	Didn't know.
563680	565680	The wife of a president, I'm like, I don't want to film.
565680	568680	I don't want to deify anybody.
568680	570680	Because if you're deifying her, you're deifying her
570680	573680	for breakfast in America, or whatever that arrow was called.
573680	575680	It's a dawning of a new age where we're
575680	577680	going to take all the mentally ill people and throw them
577680	580680	in the street and just call them homeless from now on.
580680	582680	Like, that's not her.
582680	584680	She wasn't, like, banging a gavel and saying,
584680	585680	we should do that.
585680	588680	She wasn't necessarily, like, here's the thing.
588680	592680	Big, big, big, big mistake we made during that era,
592680	594680	the biggest complaint that you can, I mean,
594680	595680	is the gay community.
595680	597680	Because they literally, not only were they not
597680	603680	responsive to what they knew was an epidemic,
603680	607680	they actually, there's paper trails of them, like, going,
607680	608680	let's actually come on.
608680	612680	We don't need that much funding for, like, that area and stuff.
612680	613680	Yeah, scandalous.
613680	617680	And there was a, yeah, scandalous because it was a gay
617680	618680	disease.
618680	622680	And then there's a story I read today.
622680	624680	She just died, so I'm, like, standing over a grave
624680	626680	and going, now let's talk about what a shitty time that was.
626680	628680	I'm not talking about her.
628680	630680	She's probably an amazing person.
630680	632680	If I were Nancy Reagan and my legacy,
632680	635680	we're all going to remember her for having a red dress being
635680	637680	a first lady in that order.
637680	639680	And say no to drugs.
639680	640680	Just say no.
640680	642680	What is she fucking just OD'd?
642680	644680	If I were Nancy, I would just say,
644680	647680	I'm just going to speedball it.
647680	651680	I want you to find me with Dave Navarro on a bathroom floor.
651680	653680	Or if she just sat on her deathbed,
653680	659680	if she just said, like, listen, just say yes to all of it.
659680	661680	Yeah.
661680	666680	Yeah, there was a story I read in this, like,
666680	668680	it brought all kinds of memories back to me
668680	672680	because it was a story about how, it's a bit, like,
672680	676680	it's a bit, I mean, it's inflammatory.
676680	677680	Like, maybe you don't even need it.
677680	679680	Your hair looks amazing tonight.
679680	680680	Did you blow dry it?
680680	682680	What's going on?
682680	683680	Did you shampoo?
683680	684680	What's going on?
684680	685680	Just assume you're making fun of me.
685680	686680	No, I'm not.
686680	689680	I'm saying, it looks really nice.
689680	690680	Okay, all right.
690680	692680	Having flashbacks from the school bus.
692680	695680	This guy can't, cannot take a cup of it.
695680	696680	Okay, I get it.
696680	697680	I look good.
697680	698680	It's hilarious.
698680	703680	God damn it.
703680	704680	Just say thank you, Jeff.
704680	705680	Thank you, Jeff.
705680	709680	Thank you, Jeff.
709680	712680	I'd thank you, but I don't know if it's true or not.
712680	713680	Your hair looks...
713680	714680	I'll have, let me look.
714680	715680	It looks...
715680	717680	I don't, I don't know.
717680	721680	Well, that's not, I can't see what happens on that camera.
721680	723680	I'm going to look...
723680	724680	Give a profile.
724680	726680	And if I agree, then I'll say thank you.
726680	728680	Give a profile to all the cameras right now so we can see.
728680	729680	Oh.
729680	735680	See?
735680	736680	Right?
736680	738680	It's looking good.
739680	740680	Here, here.
740680	741680	Wow.
741680	742680	All right.
742680	743680	Is there a way you can see?
743680	746680	Can I show you what I'm seeing from the, like, when you face forward?
746680	747680	Will that work from your camera?
747680	753680	Well, it'll involve some coming and going, but you can't airdrop it to me, but...
753680	754680	Is this...
754680	755680	Oh, well, I can't.
755680	756680	No, I can't see that.
756680	760680	No, you need to take a picture of him in profile.
760680	763680	That's...
772680	775680	We're so old.
775680	778680	Dan, you look just like me.
778680	780680	That's so funny.
780680	782680	We're so old.
782680	788680	I, I really, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope it stays this fun until we just die, like...
788680	791680	I mean, that's apparently, Nancy Reagan was like, yeah, I'm 94.
791680	794680	I don't understand Donald Trump.
794680	797680	Like, must be nice, because a lot of people are like, I'm 17.
797680	804680	I just ate my shoe, but...
804680	806680	That's a terrible way to die.
806680	807680	Yeah.
807680	810680	I just now found out you can eat a shoe.
810680	817680	People, back in the old days of leather shoes, when you got hungry enough, you boiled your boot and you ate it.
817680	819680	Werner Herzog ate a boot?
819680	822680	Werner Herzog did a bet with Robert Zemeckis.
822680	824680	Who was it?
824680	827680	Errol Morris.
827680	831680	If it was Robert Zemeckis, you wouldn't be able to trust the results.
831680	832680	I bet.
832680	834680	I bet that's not a real boot.
834680	837680	He did a bet about...
837680	841680	They had some gentleman's bet about the documentary world.
841680	843680	Finishing a film on time.
843680	845680	Finishing a film on time, okay, good, perfect.
845680	847680	Finishing a film by a certain deadline.
847680	849680	Finishing a film by a certain deadline.
849680	850680	Go on.
850680	851680	Herzog...
851680	853680	The bet was that he would eat a shoe.
853680	855680	And did Errol Morris shoot Herzog eating a shoe?
855680	856680	Yeah.
856680	857680	Should look it up.
857680	858680	He fried it in duck fat.
858680	859680	What's that?
859680	861680	He fried it in duck fat.
861680	862680	Oh, he fried it in duck fat.
862680	863680	Oh, fancy.
863680	864680	All right.
864680	866680	I guess we ate a shoe.
866680	869680	Yeah, I mean, if you're gonna eat a shoe...
869680	870680	What kind of shoe is it?
870680	872680	Is it like a Reebok or...
873680	874680	Headline.
874680	878680	Nancy Reagan refused to help dying Rock Hudson get AIDS treatment.
878680	881680	Is that true?
881680	884680	It's a story that is like...
884680	886680	I was reading it and it was like bringing back all these memories
886680	889680	because the interesting thing is it's a story about...
889680	892680	I don't know if this should be on her hands or not,
892680	897680	but how Rock Hudson, back in those days,
897680	902680	in France they had treatments that were far more advanced than ours
902680	905680	along the road of acknowledging AIDS and how to treat it.
905680	908680	Rock Hudson was in line to get that treatment,
908680	912680	but he was blocked at an international level because this was a French hospital
912680	914680	and there was red tape tying it up.
914680	917680	And there was a point where somebody had called the White House and said,
917680	922680	this is a friend of Nancy's from the acting day, a friend of Ronald's.
922680	926680	A call from the White House might be able to get him through to this French hospital.
927680	932680	So this incident is sort of pulled apart
932680	934680	and you're talking to each person on the chain.
934680	939680	The person that answered that call and went to Nancy Reagan and said,
939680	941680	this is the situation with Rock Hudson,
941680	944680	he acknowledges he's on the side of like,
944680	949680	this is not about AIDS being stigmatized or anything like that.
949680	952680	That it was about objectivity, egalitarianism.
952680	955680	Oh God, if we did a favor for our Hollywood friend, can you imagine?
955680	958680	Lots of other people, of course, making the very valid observation that,
958680	963680	give me a break, if Bob Hope had colon cancer, you wouldn't fucking bomb Tibet.
967680	970680	Just to get your frustrations out.
971680	975680	But wasn't it Rock Hudson's death from AIDS,
975680	978680	what softened the Reagan stance on it?
978680	980680	Wasn't that the first time they kind of acknowledged it?
980680	983680	Well, that's what got me really thinking about this because part of this article is,
983680	987680	it's not all just sort of slinging and TMZ-ing about,
987680	993680	oh, Nancy Reagan didn't, it goes into, conjures these memories.
993680	999680	A lot of you guys, I was on the playground and Rock Hudson died of AIDS
999680	1007680	and the two things that happened were just a huge avalanche of horrible, horrible jokes.
1007680	1009680	Just like, that's how I most remember it in my brain,
1009680	1015680	it's like the 10,000 awful, even by then standards, let alone today's,
1015680	1018680	horrible, horrible jokes about this guy, Rock Hudson, that none of us had ever heard of
1018680	1020680	because we were kids on a playground.
1020680	1022680	It's just like, Rock Hudson this, Rock Hudson that, knock, knock, who's there?
1022680	1024680	Rock Hudson's a gay, that's an underwear.
1024680	1026680	It's just like everything.
1026680	1030680	Really, they were just gay jokes because no one understood what AIDS was and what it meant.
1030680	1033680	I remember a bunch and I won't repeat them because they're terrible.
1033680	1041680	It's a sad, wistful kind of story because you remember this guy,
1041680	1048680	he kind of wished that he could have known because obviously he went out fighting and scared
1048680	1053680	and probably ashamed, probably deeply ashamed.
1053680	1061680	He's sort of the Randy Quaid in the Independence Day.
1061680	1066680	Everyone acknowledges historically and in fact academically that Rock Hudson
1066680	1071680	showing up on the radar at that time managed to nudge the meteor
1071680	1076680	that could have destroyed so much more a little bit out of its trajectory
1076680	1078680	that people had to start talking about it.
1078680	1080680	There was no choice left anymore.
1080680	1086680	All that leads to dollars and cents going and whatever.
1086680	1089680	It was a weird day, I think, for a lot of people because Ronald Reagan's long dead
1090680	1095680	and it was like Nancy Reagan died and she was actually kind of a weird day
1095680	1098680	for a lot of people with a lot of gay friends who died back then
1098680	1104680	because we were sort of in a, and now she's dead and it's like do you spit?
1104680	1108680	If you're a 55 year old gay guy, do you go like fuck you?
1108680	1113680	I hope it hurt when you died.
1113680	1115680	Stop me if I've mentioned this before on the show,
1115680	1120680	but like 20 years after the king and I, I went and met the leading lady
1120680	1123680	who was 20 years later so now I'm like three feet taller
1123680	1129680	and I was 11 when I last saw her and I was 31 and she was 41 when I knew her
1129680	1133680	and now she's 61 and we met with a great talk and at one point I said like
1133680	1134680	how was so-and-so?
1134680	1138680	And I mentioned all the dancers and she's like they're all gone.
1138680	1140680	And I said all of them?
1140680	1141680	I go what about so-and-so?
1141680	1142680	What about so-and-so?
1142680	1143680	They're all dead, Jeff.
1143680	1145680	They all died like a few years later.
1145680	1149680	And the only dancer in the show that wasn't dead was the only straight guy
1149680	1151680	that was married to one of the women dancers.
1151680	1155680	Just everybody else is gone and she goes also that's just one show.
1155680	1157680	She goes all of Broadway died.
1157680	1163680	And not just our dancers but engineers and artists and you know like doctors
1163680	1165680	and like a huge generation.
1165680	1169680	And I'm not the first person to say this or put this theory out there,
1169680	1173680	but I think the idiocracy that we're living in right now and the candidates
1173680	1176680	that are running to rule the world right now, I think a lot of it,
1176680	1182680	we never recovered from a giant generation of smart people dying like at once.
1182680	1187680	Like in the same way that England never quite recovered from all of its intelligent men
1187680	1190680	all dying in two wars over a couple generations.
1190680	1192680	And you don't get a Churchill anymore.
1192680	1194680	You get Cameron and those fucking dick wads.
1195680	1198680	Jeff's saying Churchill was gay.
1198680	1203680	Which I think that's cool, but you're going to get flack for that.
1203680	1206680	Churchill? Oh could he suck a dick.
1206680	1210680	That's why he loves cigars. He was practicing the whole time.
1210680	1214680	They named the Churchill cigar after him because it was the most like a dick.
1215680	1219680	The only thing we have to fear is fear itself and insert stereotype
1219680	1222680	about curtains or prosciutto or something like that.
1223680	1227680	Yes. I bracketed it. I'm not fucking...
1227680	1229680	The whole quote was the only thing we have to fear is fear itself
1229680	1231680	and terrible Hello Dolly revivals.
1233680	1237680	Alright, let's bring out Rob Schrab.
1252680	1266680	So right before I walked out on stage he let me know
1266680	1270680	I left a t-shirt that he gave me last week.
1270680	1274680	I just want to say if you don't want it I'll give it to somebody who...
1274680	1277680	Is that where you're sitting so far? Are you sitting so far away from him?
1277680	1279680	I sit here every week.
1279680	1282680	Didn't we agree that for camera it's better that he sits closer to them?
1282680	1285680	Didn't I agree that I want to sit over by you?
1285680	1287680	Guys, why do we...
1287680	1288680	Shit.
1288680	1292680	Why do we even have rehearsals Rob? Why do we come to rehearsal?
1292680	1296680	You guys are not us, but we do tech rehearsals, dress rehearsals.
1296680	1299680	We do a queue to queue rehearsal right before you guys get in here.
1299680	1303680	So are you guys ready to learn a new thing that I've learned in therapy?
1303680	1304680	Yeah.
1304680	1306680	Yes. Oh, you guys too?
1306680	1310680	Uh, that certainty...
1310680	1312680	Oh, yeah.
1312680	1319680	I have an overreactive mind and a hypervigilant mind and an easily startled mind.
1319680	1322680	These are things that I've learned in therapy.
1322680	1326680	There are symptoms of, you know...
1326680	1329680	Like when I said you had nice hair and you freaked out.
1329680	1333680	Well, I protected myself.
1334680	1337680	From a compliment.
1337680	1340680	Sorry, go ahead. Don't overreact.
1340680	1342680	I'm not going to and here's why.
1342680	1343680	Okay.
1343680	1345680	Certainty.
1345680	1348680	So certainty...
1348680	1350680	Whenever I...
1350680	1352680	My therapist has told me...
1352680	1356680	And I've already fucked it up like three times since she prescribed this, but...
1356680	1358680	At least I've noticed.
1359680	1361680	Whenever I'm certain of something,
1361680	1365680	I need to look at that as a warning sign.
1369680	1370680	Okay.
1370680	1372680	What are you certain of right now?
1372680	1374680	Nothing, man.
1374680	1376680	Nothing? You're not certain of nothing.
1376680	1377680	Give us a for instance.
1377680	1379680	Yeah, I don't get it.
1379680	1380680	Doesn't make any sense.
1380680	1382680	Well, like if you're certain...
1382680	1383680	If somebody says like,
1384680	1386680	Nice hair. Your hair looks nice.
1386680	1388680	And you're certain that they're making fun of you.
1388680	1390680	Then it's like...
1390680	1392680	Like it's before...
1392680	1395680	What if no one says that to you ever?
1395680	1397680	Well, it doesn't matter.
1397680	1400680	You could become certain of something like...
1400680	1401680	Oh, okay.
1409680	1411680	Why is this tear...
1411680	1412680	What is that?
1412680	1414680	It's a dune tube.
1414680	1416680	It blew up his thigh.
1416680	1418680	Oh my God, his tear blew up his thigh.
1418680	1420680	It didn't blow up my thigh.
1420680	1423680	Slow-mo atomic bomb tears.
1423680	1427680	You could become certain of something sitting in your apartment alone.
1427680	1429680	True.
1429680	1431680	And probably that's actually...
1431680	1434680	Talking to people is the...
1434680	1436680	Probably the...
1436680	1438680	I'm just thinking...
1438680	1441680	It's the surefire way to become uncertain.
1441680	1444680	And we've kind of fight that because we get rewarded for it.
1444680	1446680	We think or we stay safe.
1446680	1447680	We go like,
1447680	1451680	This motherfucker trying to tell me that I want my bun toasted.
1453680	1457680	I've been eating this breakfast sandwich for nine out of five years.
1457680	1459680	I ain't never got the bun toasted.
1459680	1462680	This motherfucker trying to tell me I'm posing.
1462680	1463680	He's trying to upsell me.
1463680	1464680	And then you go like,
1464680	1467680	Let me guess. Toasting the bun costs more.
1467680	1468680	And they're like,
1468680	1469680	No.
1469680	1471680	Just thought you might like the bun toasted.
1471680	1473680	We're trying to make it nice for you.
1473680	1474680	Psycho.
1474680	1475680	And you're like...
1475680	1476680	And then you look back and you go,
1476680	1478680	Oh, I was certain of something.
1478680	1481680	If you had the same amount of information going through your head,
1481680	1483680	you could just as easily go,
1483680	1486680	Oh, and does it cost more to have the bun toasted?
1486680	1488680	It's the information you need.
1488680	1490680	So up-speak.
1492680	1495680	Look, this isn't for everybody.
1496680	1497680	She specifically said,
1497680	1502680	Other people need to have more confidence in their certainty than you do.
1502680	1504680	She said to me.
1504680	1505680	Like who?
1505680	1507680	Like anybody but me.
1507680	1508680	I don't know.
1508680	1509680	Is she name-named?
1509680	1510680	What?
1511680	1513680	Don't you guys go to the same therapist?
1513680	1515680	Well, Troy and Bob and Eric.
1515680	1519680	Why would she name eight billion people instead of just focusing on me?
1519680	1520680	That was three.
1521680	1524680	Dan, what are you certain about right now?
1524680	1527680	Rob is undermining the show.
1527680	1528680	No.
1529680	1532680	No, I'm going to make a conscious effort not to do that.
1532680	1536680	Because I listen to the show and I've been bad.
1536680	1543680	And I don't want to cause pain, especially you.
1543680	1546680	And I don't, you know, I'm just...
1546680	1552680	I have questions and I just don't get answers very often, you know.
1552680	1554680	I'm trying to figure it out.
1554680	1557680	I'm just trying to figure it out like the rest of y'all, man.
1557680	1558680	Trying to get home.
1558680	1561680	I'm like, you know...
1561680	1564680	I'm like Bill Paxton in Trespass, man.
1564680	1569680	I'm like, I'm just trying to make it by like everybody else, man.
1569680	1572680	You know, I'm trying to make it by.
1572680	1574680	I'm trying to make it by like everybody else.
1575680	1578680	I'm trying to make it by like everybody else.
1578680	1582680	I think you're trying to convince us that trying to make it by is an actual saying.
1582680	1584680	I'm trying to make it by.
1584680	1586680	Hitler tried to make it by.
1586680	1588680	I'm trying to make it by.
1588680	1591680	It doesn't even matter if he did or not.
1591680	1593680	I'm trying to make it by like everybody else.
1593680	1596680	He tried it in a very specific way.
1596680	1597680	That's the difference.
1597680	1599680	Everyone tries to make it by.
1599680	1601680	Some people think six million Jews are in their way.
1601680	1603680	I'm just trying to make it by.
1603680	1606680	No, he thought a lot more Jews were in their way.
1606680	1608680	He fell short of his mark.
1608680	1613680	That's an important thing to settle.
1613680	1617680	I guarantee you when Hitler was in the bunker and he's about to blow him and his dog
1617680	1619680	and his girlfriend or newly...
1619680	1621680	The dog was like, what the fuck?
1621680	1623680	I'm just a dog.
1623680	1625680	I just got here.
1625680	1627680	I got to go too.
1627680	1630680	They tried the cyanide out on the dog to make sure the cyanide worked.
1630680	1632680	They didn't want to do some bogus cyanide
1632680	1634680	because he was so paranoid that he thought
1634680	1636680	maybe somebody gave me some fugazi cyanide
1636680	1638680	that it's just going to make you go sleepy town.
1638680	1640680	I'm going to wake up in a Russian jail.
1640680	1642680	He's like, let's make sure this is actual
1642680	1645680	not kill a dog, kill a Hitler cyanide.
1645680	1647680	He killed his beloved dog.
1647680	1653680	One of the only things that we know that he liked was his dog.
1653680	1659680	He was thinking that two birds with one thing.
1659680	1661680	He was like, I want to kill my...
1661680	1663680	He killed his whole family, right?
1663680	1664680	No, that was...
1664680	1665680	Goebbels killed his whole family.
1665680	1667680	He killed all the children and shit.
1667680	1669680	Hitler went in and killed Eva Braun himself.
1669680	1671680	But he tried it on the dog first to make sure.
1671680	1673680	And he really liked that dog.
1673680	1675680	I think that was probably the hardest decision he probably ever made.
1675680	1678680	He was like, ah.
1678680	1680680	Eva, Eva, Eva.
1680680	1681680	Give me a second.
1681680	1685680	I know that in two minutes I'm going to shoot you in the head with my Luger.
1685680	1687680	But I don't want to make sure...
1688680	1689680	It's not just knock you out.
1689680	1691680	And Eva's like, you killed how many Jews?
1691680	1693680	Give me a fucking break.
1693680	1694680	Kill the dog.
1694680	1695680	Kill the dog and let's...
1695680	1696680	Yeah, the dog is your problem.
1696680	1697680	Wrap it up.
1697680	1699680	The dog he's worried about.
1699680	1700680	Wrap it up, man.
1700680	1701680	If the dog he's worried about...
1701680	1702680	Wrap it up.
1702680	1706680	I'm just trying to get by, man.
1706680	1707680	Wrap it up.
1707680	1709680	See, he used to be making fire.
1709680	1711680	Now he's trying to get by.
1711680	1713680	Wrap it up, man.
1713680	1714680	Come on.
1714680	1716680	Just wrap it up.
1716680	1717680	Wrap it up.
1717680	1723680	If I vacuum this living room one more time, I'm going to kill myself.
1723680	1727680	And you think they got in a big fight where she's like, what are you doing?
1727680	1729680	He's like, I'm trying to get out of the dog.
1729680	1730680	And she's like, why?
1730680	1737680	And he's like, because I don't want it to have it turn out to hurt anybody or anyone to have to suffer.
1737680	1740680	And she's like, oh, Mr. Anti-suffering all of a sudden.
1740680	1742680	And then he's like, wait, what does that mean?
1742680	1744680	And she's like, oh, come on.
1744680	1745680	What do you think it means?
1745680	1746680	Just give me the pill.
1746680	1750680	And he's like, wait, no, I'm not killing us until you tell me what the fuck that meant.
1750680	1753680	Because I came home and told you I want to kill the Jews.
1753680	1754680	And you said that's nice, sweetie.
1754680	1758680	You said that's nice, sweetie.
1758680	1761680	And don't you fucking turn your back on me now.
1761680	1763680	The Russians are at the door.
1763680	1765680	We are about to die.
1765680	1769680	Are we on the same team or not?
1769680	1771680	Just give me the pill.
1771680	1772680	Just give me the pill.
1772680	1776680	It's important to me.
1776680	1780680	Why doesn't anyone care about what's important to me?
1780680	1782680	Hitler.
1782680	1786680	Do you know what a long day I've had?
1786680	1792680	No one ever asks what I want.
1792680	1796680	Anyway, I know.
1797680	1804680	Do you think Hitler had a certainty issue too?
1804680	1806680	So you think you have that in common.
1806680	1809680	You said eight billion other people don't have what you have.
1809680	1813680	But you think probably Hitler too, right?
1813680	1819680	See, I just felt the flash of certainty that you were my enemy.
1819680	1823680	And then I just let it float down a river like a lotus leaf.
1823680	1825680	And now I'm not certain anymore.
1825680	1828680	Because someone compares you to Hitler, does it mean they're your enemy?
1828680	1834680	Exactly. What do I know?
1834680	1838680	I know my uncle's ghost is here.
1838680	1842680	But that's not certainty. That's just my ghost busting equipment.
1842680	1844680	So the EKGs are going up.
1844680	1848680	Spencer, do you relate to that certainty issue or do you have a whole different kind of angle?
1848680	1851680	Not with me, man, but I get what he's saying.
1851680	1855680	It sounds like his therapist identified a pattern of self-depeding thinking
1855680	1861680	and tried to get him to identify it early on and intervene before it gets out of control.
1861680	1867680	It seems pretty smart.
1867680	1868680	And it starts with me.
1868680	1872680	How about that ghost busters, right?
1872680	1877680	I intentionally did not watch the trailer, even though everybody on Facebook and Twitter is trying to make me watch it.
1877680	1881680	I don't want to know a single thing about it. I want to walk in cold to that one.
1881680	1882680	Yeah, I'm not going to watch it.
1882680	1883680	Trailers are dumb, man.
1883680	1888680	Those buttons are too hot.
1888680	1898680	I want it to be good because who doesn't want to enjoy something?
1898680	1900680	I feel that way about every trailer.
1900680	1903680	I agree with that because of course we all want to have fun at all times.
1903680	1904680	What if you didn't agree with that?
1904680	1911680	I didn't know that there was a Batman Superman movie coming out until this young Latina Lyft driver.
1911680	1915680	She goes, so are you excited about the new Superman Batman movie?
1915680	1918680	I look up at a billboard and I'm like, oh, I didn't know there was one.
1918680	1920680	She goes, are you going to go see it?
1920680	1924680	I was like, you know, if everybody that I like says it's awesome, I'll probably go see it.
1924680	1927680	If nobody says it's great, I will never see it.
1927680	1929680	And I go, who's playing it?
1929680	1930680	She goes, Ben Affleck is Batman.
1930680	1932680	I'm like, not seeing it.
1932680	1934680	That's fucking dumb.
1934680	1935680	Dumb.
1935680	1936680	That does sound super dumb.
1936680	1937680	I just don't see how that could ever work.
1937680	1940680	I might see it if he never is Bruce Wayne and only has the mask on the whole time.
1940680	1944680	So I'd never have to look at his dumb face.
1944680	1948680	Ben Affleck, I know you listen to Harmon Town.
1948680	1950680	You have a dumb face.
1950680	1955680	I guess it must be pickier because I was actually only picturing with the mask on and I was still like thrown.
1955680	1957680	No, he's getting Bruce Wayne it up.
1957680	1961680	He's mostly Bruce Wayne, I think, the way they've been selling it.
1961680	1966680	Who's directing this one?
1966680	1969680	Zack Snyder.
1969680	1971680	Zack Snyder.
1971680	1973680	Never heard of him.
1973680	1976680	Do we know what the outfit looks like?
1976680	1980680	Is it going to be a weird nipple Batman?
1980680	1985680	It looks more like old school, like Frank Miller Batman.
1985680	1987680	Are you excited about us, Rob?
1987680	1989680	You care about such things.
1989680	1992680	I still haven't seen Star Wars key chain.
1992680	1993680	Me neither.
1993680	1994680	Me neither.
1994680	1996680	I went to Star Wars.
1996680	1999680	The story's going to start off in a disappointing fashion.
1999680	2003680	I had just done yoga and spin.
2003680	2009680	And then as one does, when you're on a health kick, I went straight to the drawing room to have drinks.
2009680	2016680	And then my friends said, hey, we have an extra ticket to go see Star Wars because it was like the week after it came out.
2016680	2017680	You want to come?
2017680	2018680	So I was tired.
2018680	2024680	And if you do yoga and spin and you have three drinks, you're sleepy.
2024680	2027680	So I fell asleep five minutes into that movie.
2027680	2028680	And they had the 3D glasses on.
2028680	2030680	And after the movie was over, they had to wake me up.
2030680	2031680	Like, Jeff.
2031680	2032680	Jeff.
2032680	2033680	I'm like, huh?
2033680	2034680	Really?
2034680	2035680	Five minutes in was asleep.
2035680	2038680	It was a great nap because you got great music.
2038680	2039680	Beep beep beep.
2039680	2040680	Beep beep beep.
2040680	2041680	Beep beep beep.
2041680	2042680	All this good music.
2042680	2045680	And they're like, oh, we thought you were just really in the zone.
2046680	2047680	I was like...
2052680	2054680	So then I was like, I got to go see this movie.
2054680	2055680	I'm going to go see it alone.
2055680	2056680	I'm going to be rested.
2056680	2057680	I'm going to be sober.
2057680	2058680	I'm going to watch this movie.
2058680	2059680	This is Star Wars?
2059680	2060680	Star Wars.
2060680	2061680	And I...
2061680	2062680	You're going back to see Star Wars the second time.
2062680	2063680	No, no, no.
2063680	2064680	This is...
2064680	2066680	I'm saying to myself the next week, I'm like, okay, I got to go back and see that.
2066680	2067680	I had a dream.
2067680	2073680	I had a dream where I went to the Vista Theater in Los Feliz and saw Star Wars.
2074680	2075680	Fell asleep in it.
2076680	2077680	Fell asleep in your dream.
2077680	2078680	Fell asleep in my dream.
2078680	2079680	And then my dream...
2079680	2082680	My dream was about the dreams I had while not watching Star Wars.
2084680	2086680	So I'm like, this movie's got to be boring.
2087680	2089680	Jeff, you know, we're already impressed by you.
2089680	2091680	You don't have to tell us.
2092680	2094680	Your dreams don't have to be special.
2096680	2098680	Dan, your certainty is really bumming me out, right?
2099680	2100680	All right.
2100680	2102680	So here's why you're upset right now.
2102680	2103680	Here's why you had to undercut me.
2103680	2107680	It's because my not seeing Star Wars story is better than your not seeing Star Wars story.
2108680	2109680	I'm going to wait.
2109680	2111680	I saw it's coming in April.
2112680	2113680	That's my story.
2114680	2115680	You're right.
2115680	2116680	What's coming in April?
2116680	2117680	Star Wars.
2118680	2119680	To iTunes.
2120680	2121680	Oh, you can watch it at home.
2121680	2124680	I'm just going to watch it on iTunes like I watch everything.
2124680	2126680	I don't know about the society no more.
2128680	2130680	What's the last thing you watched on iTunes?
2131680	2134680	I watched the Omen.
2135680	2138680	I just tried to watch both versions of the Omen.
2138680	2140680	I didn't know there was a Leave Schreiber version.
2151680	2155680	My lover is a writer in the research area.
2155680	2156680	Thank you.
2157680	2158680	And a director.
2161680	2163680	You don't have to talk about Rob in the third person.
2163680	2164680	Yeah.
2164680	2165680	I'm right here.
2165680	2166680	Yes, I do.
2167680	2170680	But when I talk to him in the second or first person.
2170680	2171680	Yes.
2171680	2172680	On the phone.
2174680	2176680	You are becoming me.
2176680	2177680	I am Rob Schwab.
2184680	2185680	All right.
2185680	2186680	Well.
2186680	2188680	You're saying your lover is a writer and what?
2188680	2194680	And we're watching movies in a certain category or area.
2195680	2197680	Movies about Omen's.
2197680	2198680	Say what?
2198680	2200680	Were they all movies about Omen's?
2200680	2202680	I heard this.
2202680	2204680	Anybody hear this?
2204680	2207680	Anybody hear what I'm about to say?
2207680	2210680	I really hope you just did like a really good bird call.
2210680	2216680	I hear they're having like six flags or theme parks
2216680	2220680	or fitting people with virtual reality headsets and stuff.
2220680	2224680	And then you go on a roller coaster and you're on a spaceship
2224680	2226680	and you're flying around and stuff.
2226680	2227680	I want to do that.
2227680	2229680	That kind of is pretty cool.
2229680	2231680	I hate roller coasters, but I think that'd be good.
2231680	2232680	I love roller coasters.
2232680	2235680	Also, if you call them roller coasters, it makes them way better.
2237680	2239680	Either way, I don't like them, but I do that.
2239680	2241680	Have you been on X at Magic Mountain?
2241680	2242680	No, I don't like them.
2242680	2243680	It's fucking good.
2244680	2245680	Good.
2245680	2247680	Dave Kline, I love you, brother.
2248680	2249680	I wouldn't like it.
2249680	2250680	You wouldn't like it? Why?
2250680	2252680	You're going to make chocolate poops?
2253680	2255680	No, I just don't like roller coasters.
2255680	2258680	You afraid that when you go on a ride, you're going to make chocolate poops?
2261680	2264680	No, I don't like roller coasters.
2264680	2266680	I don't like theme parks.
2266680	2267680	I'll explain it to you.
2267680	2269680	There's this weird patronizing tick he has.
2269680	2273680	The last time I heard that, I was in a car driving home with him in an airport
2273680	2276680	and my ear hadn't popped, and I was in agonizing pain.
2276680	2280680	And I said once, between the baggage carousel and fucking home,
2280680	2283680	I said, God damn, my left ear still won't pop.
2283680	2285680	And he went, you going to make chocolate poops?
2286680	2291680	And I'm like, wow, your relationship with need is so fucked up
2291680	2293680	that even I can see it.
2293680	2294680	That's crazy.
2295680	2297680	And he just did it to you right in front of me.
2298680	2301680	Sounds like you're both about to make chocolate poops.
2304680	2306680	Spencer, you're not about to make chocolate poops.
2306680	2307680	I can tell by looking at you.
2307680	2309680	That's very kind of you to say.
2309680	2310680	I would agree.
2311680	2313680	I just call him like I see him, Dan.
2313680	2315680	Spencer and I hung out last night.
2315680	2318680	Yeah. Do any of those guys listen to Harmontown?
2319680	2320680	What?
2320680	2322680	Rob invited a bunch of weird people.
2323680	2328680	He's like, I'm having some friends over and just a bunch of weird fucking people show up.
2328680	2329680	They're not weird.
2329680	2331680	They're too nice guy.
2332680	2333680	I didn't say mean people.
2333680	2334680	I said weird people.
2334680	2335680	All right.
2335680	2338680	Well, it was like two editors from Lego.
2338680	2339680	Yeah. Bad news.
2339680	2340680	And Callie's boyfriend.
2340680	2341680	And we just...
2341680	2342680	I know. Tell me about it.
2342680	2343680	It's all bad.
2343680	2344680	All bad.
2345680	2346680	We watched this movie.
2346680	2347680	It was great.
2347680	2348680	What was it called?
2348680	2349680	Demons.
2349680	2350680	Demons.
2350680	2351680	Demons.
2351680	2352680	Oh man.
2352680	2353680	See demons.
2353680	2355680	I can't explain it because it's just a bad movie.
2355680	2358680	And explaining a bad movie just sounds terrible.
2358680	2359680	Bad as in quotes.
2360680	2361680	Harmontown.
2361680	2362680	I never saw the other omens.
2362680	2363680	I love the first one.
2363680	2364680	It's great.
2364680	2365680	Are there more than two?
2365680	2367680	Well, there's the omen with Gregory Peck.
2367680	2370680	And then there's the omen too, where I believe it's Sam Neill.
2370680	2371680	Jason Bateman.
2371680	2372680	Yeah.
2372680	2375680	Is a grown up Damien and he's just like president and stuff.
2376680	2379680	He's just like, we got to kill Jesus when he gets born.
2379680	2381680	And everyone's like, we're trying boss.
2383680	2386680	And it's somehow a three act movie, but that's all that happened.
2386680	2387680	I fell asleep.
2388680	2389680	I think I fell asleep.
2390680	2391680	I fell asleep.
2391680	2392680	I tried watching that.
2392680	2393680	I think probably with you.
2394680	2396680	So I don't want to put, I don't want to put this person on the spot.
2396680	2398680	If they're like a spot standing right here.
2399680	2401680	I'm going to, so I'm going to go with your first name first.
2401680	2402680	I'm going to say your first name.
2402680	2406680	If you think there's a reason what like, like, like Justin Roiland told me you're
2406680	2407680	here, is William here?
2407680	2408680	Yeah.
2408680	2409680	Wow.
2409680	2410680	I hear a trigger.
2410680	2411680	Okay.
2412680	2413680	All he told me is that you're here.
2413680	2416680	He didn't tell me whether or not you might be willing to come up.
2416680	2417680	Are you willing to come up?
2417680	2418680	Okay.
2418680	2419680	Well, come up, come up, come up.
2419680	2420680	And I'll introduce you.
2428680	2432680	No, you're, I mean, it'll be, it'll be interesting if it turns out to be the
2432680	2436680	case, but I guess that process didn't really filter out the possibility of you
2436680	2437680	being a lying sociopath.
2439680	2440680	You could just be a guy that goes, yeah.
2441680	2444680	Well, I am a lying sociopath, but what's your last name?
2445680	2446680	Pew.
2446680	2447680	Yes.
2447680	2449680	And you are the creator of one of the most amazing video games in the world,
2449680	2450680	The Stanley Parable.
2450680	2451680	Co-creator.
2451680	2452680	Co-creator.
2455680	2456680	Oh, right.
2456680	2457680	Yeah.
2457680	2459680	And you're visiting from the UK, so.
2459680	2460680	Yes, yes.
2460680	2463680	So you've never been in front of a crowd, maybe the exhibit.
2463680	2464680	Never this size.
2464680	2465680	It's very smaller.
2466680	2467680	It's just a little island, right?
2467680	2468680	Yeah, yeah.
2468680	2471680	But no, but you must have been a, you, you, you, you, it's a critically acclaimed
2471680	2473680	game and it's like, it's, it's amazing.
2473680	2475680	So you've been in front of adoring people before?
2475680	2476680	Yeah, yeah.
2476680	2477680	Everyone loves me.
2479680	2482680	Well, so are you an indie?
2482680	2483680	So you said you co-created it.
2483680	2484680	Who's the other person?
2484680	2485680	Davey Reeden.
2485680	2486680	Okay.
2486680	2487680	A girl?
2487680	2488680	No, Davey is.
2488680	2489680	Oh, I thought you said Debbie.
2489680	2490680	Oh, no.
2490680	2491680	I wish.
2491680	2492680	God damn it.
2492680	2493680	This is close to fucking applause.
2494680	2495680	Close.
2496680	2499680	So just the two of you, partners, like, like, like what's the expertise on both
2499680	2500680	sides?
2500680	2501680	Yeah.
2501680	2505680	So Davey was the main writer and then I kind of did a lot of script editing
2505680	2508680	and then I also did the design of it.
2508680	2511680	So the Stanley Parable is this amazing indie game.
2511680	2513680	What was it like before I explained it to them?
2513680	2515680	Because I don't fully understand what happened.
2515680	2517680	Did you go to Valve?
2517680	2518680	No.
2518680	2523680	So we, we made the game and then we talked, we talked to Valve and they just
2523680	2524680	publish it.
2524680	2526680	Oh, that's fucking amazing.
2527680	2531680	But then they were able to weave in, weave it into, aesthetically it kind of
2531680	2532680	matches the sentiment.
2532680	2533680	Oh, yeah.
2533680	2535680	Well, we were poor so we just stole all their assets.
2535680	2536680	Oh, okay.
2536680	2538680	And they just kind of licensed it outright and just threw it out to the
2538680	2539680	public.
2539680	2540680	That's awesome.
2540680	2541680	Those guys are great.
2541680	2546680	He made this amazing critically acclaimed video game where you, look at
2546680	2547680	these guys.
2548680	2549680	What?
2549680	2550680	I'm explaining to you guys.
2550680	2551680	I'm into it.
2551680	2552680	Hello.
2552680	2553680	What's your name, by the way?
2553680	2554680	William.
2554680	2555680	William what?
2555680	2556680	Pew.
2556680	2557680	Oh, Pew.
2557680	2558680	Yes.
2558680	2559680	William Pew.
2559680	2560680	You already insulted, you know, all of Britain, you know.
2560680	2561680	I was, I was upset by that.
2561680	2562680	I, I insulted Churchill.
2562680	2563680	Yeah.
2563680	2564680	Basically all of Britain.
2564680	2565680	No, no, no.
2565680	2566680	I actually, I said, I insulted Cameron.
2566680	2567680	I liked Churchill.
2567680	2568680	Yeah, he is a, yeah, fuck him.
2568680	2569680	Yeah.
2569680	2570680	Shit.
2570680	2571680	He's a pig fucker.
2571680	2572680	He's a pig fucker.
2572680	2573680	He didn't fuck it.
2573680	2575680	He just put his dick in it.
2577680	2578680	Um, all right.
2578680	2581680	So anyways, it's, it's an amazing video game.
2581680	2586680	You, you never, and you never, uh, there's no, there's no, somebody's given birth to
2586680	2592680	a hemorrhoid in my, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's like a third person shooter.
2592680	2593680	Go for it.
2593680	2597680	And then, uh, but there's no shooting and you just walked through this thing and it's
2597680	2598680	based on the narration.
2598680	2602680	There's a VO that keeps explaining about you in the third person.
2602680	2603680	Voiceover.
2603680	2606680	That Stan Stanley did this and Stanley did that.
2606680	2610680	And there's, and so you're coordinated with the voiceover up into a definitive point where
2610680	2613680	there's like a red door and a blue door.
2613680	2616680	And then it says, and so it's, it's been telling you Stanley looked around the room.
2616680	2618680	Well, there's nothing really to do, but look around the room.
2618680	2619680	Stanley walked down the hall.
2619680	2622680	Well, there's only a hall you could walk down, but there comes this definitive point early
2622680	2624680	in the game where there's a red door and a blue door.
2624680	2625680	I'm, I'm, I'm paraphrasing.
2625680	2627680	I don't know if it's literally that I can't remember.
2627680	2631680	And then the voiceover says, Stanley thought about it for a moment and then walked through
2631680	2633680	the red door, but you can do either thing.
2633680	2637680	And so you have to decide right in that moment, am I going to keep doing what the voiceover
2637680	2641680	says that I'm doing or am I going to definitively do the opposite?
2641680	2644680	What did you do?
2644680	2645680	It doesn't matter.
2645680	2647680	It puts you in that experience.
2647680	2650680	And every choice that you make has like this tree of.
2650680	2652680	Is it a console game or an app game or?
2652680	2654680	It's a PC and Mac.
2654680	2655680	All right.
2655680	2656680	Yeah.
2656680	2657680	And what is it?
2657680	2660680	And there's a tree in it.
2660680	2661680	A tree of logic.
2661680	2662680	Yeah.
2662680	2663680	How old are you?
2663680	2664680	You look 11.
2664680	2665680	I'm 22.
2665680	2666680	Jesus Christ.
2666680	2667680	11.
2667680	2670680	So what is so, so, so when did you say 22 in England there?
2670680	2672680	I was not twice 11.
2672680	2674680	You were 19 when you made it.
2674680	2675680	But when do you start?
2675680	2678680	So as you, you must, you must have been like a little lima bean when you started getting
2678680	2679680	interested in computers.
2679680	2680680	Yeah.
2680680	2686680	I used to be a plant, but now what's your earliest memory of interfacing with a computing
2686680	2687680	machine?
2687680	2688680	When did you germinate?
2688680	2693680	I think when I was 10, like I learned flash for like animation and so you started, that's
2693680	2694680	when you started coding.
2694680	2695680	Yeah.
2695680	2696680	Oh, God.
2696680	2703680	I like those Chelsea boots you got on there, man.
2703680	2704680	Oh, thank you.
2704680	2705680	Those are swinging.
2705680	2706680	Oh.
2706680	2707680	Where'd you get them?
2707680	2708680	Get a room.
2708680	2709680	Leads.
2709680	2710680	Leads.
2710680	2711680	Leads.
2711680	2712680	Oh, they got fucking good boots up in there.
2712680	2713680	Oh, yeah.
2713680	2715680	Are you from Leeds?
2715680	2716680	No.
2716680	2722160	I'm near there, but even where I'm from, people don't know where I'm from.
2722160	2724440	So why would you?
2724440	2725440	This goes nowhere.
2725440	2726440	This conversation goes nowhere.
2726440	2727440	I'm just trying to-
2727440	2728440	I'll give them a shot.
2728440	2729440	Where are you from?
2729440	2730440	What part of England are you from?
2730440	2734120	I am from a small village called Triangle in West Yorkshire.
2734120	2735120	Triangle?
2735120	2736120	Yes.
2736120	2737120	Awesome.
2737120	2738120	That's named after the shape.
2738120	2739120	Oh, so you're from Northern?
2739120	2740120	You're from way up north?
2740120	2741120	Pardon?
2741120	2742120	You're from way up north then?
2742120	2743120	Yes.
2743120	2744120	Yes.
2744120	2745120	You know Ilkley-More-Bartat?
2745120	2746120	No.
2746120	2747120	Yes, you do.
2747120	2748120	I might.
2748120	2749120	I don't know.
2749120	2750120	I wasn't-
2750120	2751120	It's a song.
2751120	2752120	Oh, I thought it was a place.
2752120	2753120	It's a Yorkshire song.
2753120	2754120	Oh.
2754120	2755120	I thought it was a video game.
2755120	2756120	Okay.
2756120	2757120	Sit down.
2757120	2760120	Carmen Sandie fucking Eggo.
2760120	2766040	Someone's making chocolate pooping.
2766040	2771520	So it's a relatively short period of time since the first day that you started interfacing
2771520	2775280	with a machine and realizing that you could do more than just consume what it was checking
2775280	2780280	out at you and you could make it do what you wanted to around 10 years old.
2780280	2786160	Nine years later, you're creating a video game that if a middle-aged man had come up
2786160	2790400	with after decades and decades of interfacing with machines, they would have been very,
2790400	2791640	very proud of.
2791640	2793000	Not to mention a middle-aged woman.
2793000	2798000	Don't fucking write letters.
2798000	2802400	So I want to ask you a couple things first.
2802400	2810240	There's a tree of things that I could ask you as a kind of parable.
2811240	2816720	I think the thing that makes it critically acclaimed is that it has a distinct style,
2816720	2819720	distinct voice.
2819720	2825000	It's a video game that looks like a film that's directed and yet you're interacting with it.
2825000	2831640	So which of you and your partner are ... Who's got this weird passion for subverting the
2831640	2832640	entire ...
2832640	2835640	That was both of us, I suppose.
2835640	2839640	Yeah, you don't want to throw him under the bus and say, yeah, he's the nuts and bolts
2839640	2840640	guy.
2840640	2841640	He did a lot of very important work.
2841640	2842640	But it was all me.
2842640	2843640	That's the important thing.
2843640	2844640	Yeah, hi, me.
2844640	2845640	Pardon?
2845640	2846640	What?
2846640	2851120	I mean, does this represent ... Are we getting a glimpse since you are so young?
2851120	2857600	Are we getting a glimpse at something that you wish had you the resources?
2857600	2858600	Is this what you want to keep doing?
2858600	2859600	Is this just the beginning?
2859600	2860600	Yeah, I know.
2860600	2864560	I employ people now to do it for me.
2864560	2866680	What's your vision of the ultimate video game?
2866680	2867680	Are you excited about VR?
2867680	2868680	Yeah.
2868720	2871720	Yeah, I'm here to work on a VR thing with Justin, actually.
2871720	2872720	All right.
2872720	2873720	Woo!
2873720	2874720	I wish he would have told me about that, but ...
2874720	2875720	Voice rover.
2875720	2881720	No, I'm just kidding.
2881720	2886720	It was good, but don't go back and look at it.
2886720	2888720	All right, okay.
2888720	2889720	Keep going.
2889720	2890720	Keep going.
2890720	2893720	Are you going to move to the stage?
2893720	2894720	Nah.
2894720	2895720	Nah.
2895720	2896720	I think it's very ...
2896720	2897720	It's too dry.
2897760	2898760	It's sunny.
2898760	2899760	It's a desert.
2899760	2900760	There's a whole state.
2900760	2901760	Yeah.
2901760	2903760	You could move to Portland, like work in slickers.
2903760	2906760	I don't know anything about Portland.
2906760	2911760	It's like England, but it's connected to a giant America.
2911760	2917760	It's like there's a land bridge to the rest of ... I don't know.
2917760	2920760	Some people find it convenient.
2920760	2923760	England seems ... It looks like I get claustrophobic.
2923760	2924760	It seems very small.
2924760	2925760	How did it start?
2925800	2927800	What was the beginning of that?
2927800	2929800	Had you already worked on games before?
2929800	2931800	Yeah, I'd done stuff called mods.
2931800	2936800	You'd take a game that already exists, like Half-Life or whatever,
2936800	2937800	and then you'd just change things.
2937800	2940800	You'd make things out of the already existing parts,
2940800	2943800	and you'd move it about, and that's what I did for a while.
2943800	2944800	What kind of mods did you make?
2944800	2947800	Are they just unofficial, just for your own things?
2947800	2950800	Yeah, I mostly made maps for Team Fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead.
2950800	2951800	Okay, cool.
2951800	2954800	Also, you weren't an employee of the game manufacturing.
2954840	2955840	Oh, no, no.
2955840	2956840	You were just doing it on your own.
2956840	2960840	No, I don't think it was legal for them to employ someone that young.
2960840	2961840	Oh, really?
2961840	2962840	No, no.
2962840	2963840	It was my first job.
2963840	2965840	So you were, what, under 18 men?
2965840	2968840	Yeah, I started working on it when I was 17,
2968840	2970840	and then it got released when I was 19.
2970840	2974840	So then you learned the skills that you needed to make your own game.
2974840	2976840	Are you coding the whole thing?
2976840	2977840	You're doing it all yourself?
2977840	2978840	There's not that much coding.
2978840	2979840	I don't know how to code.
2979840	2980840	All right.
2980840	2982840	So you just come up with the concept of a game, then?
2982880	2987880	Yes, yes, and then using the tools that you get to put that together.
2987880	2989880	And do you go in, like, you're pitching a TV show?
2989880	2992880	Here's a game idea I have, and you pitch it to this larger company?
2992880	2994880	Like, usually how it works is a rev share,
2994880	2996880	and you get the people on the team that you need to, like, make it,
2996880	2998880	and then you just split the revenue.
2998880	2999880	Wow.
2999880	3000880	Yeah.
3000880	3001880	Great.
3001880	3002880	Do you have another game in the works?
3002880	3003880	Yeah, a couple.
3003880	3004880	Cool.
3004880	3005880	That's great.
3005880	3006880	Is it all...
3006880	3009880	Obviously, you're going to tell me if there's something you don't want to say out loud,
3009920	3013920	but is it all 2D or all VR, your next project?
3013920	3014920	Um...
3014920	3016920	We've got two.
3016920	3018920	One is 2D and one is VR.
3021920	3022920	Uh, and, uh...
3022920	3023920	Pretty funny.
3023920	3024920	Tell me every...
3026920	3027920	Funny.
3027920	3028920	Funny bit.
3028920	3030920	Funny bit there.
3030920	3032920	You've got two of them.
3032920	3034920	I see how that's hilarious.
3034920	3037920	I just want to know what that guy was laughing at.
3037920	3038920	Yeah.
3039920	3044920	Well, let's not cross the line into full shaming him about it.
3044920	3045920	No, no, no, no, no.
3045920	3046920	But I would...
3046920	3047920	I don't know.
3047920	3051920	Sir, I'm going to look down and close my eyes if you want to just call out
3051920	3054920	maybe what it was that was amusing you.
3054920	3055920	His reaction.
3055920	3057920	The Williams reaction?
3057920	3058920	Yeah.
3058920	3059920	How did I react?
3059920	3060920	Just subtly.
3060920	3061920	I don't know.
3061920	3062920	Oh.
3062920	3063920	Good.
3063920	3064920	Something that's...
3064920	3065920	There's several layers.
3065920	3066920	No, it's okay.
3066920	3067920	We don't know.
3067960	3069960	It's been a great time at your show.
3069960	3070960	Jesus Christ.
3070960	3071960	Yeah.
3071960	3072960	Come on.
3072960	3073960	Hey, guys.
3073960	3074960	What is wrong with you?
3074960	3077960	Make sure you guys are laughing for the right reason.
3077960	3078960	Yeah.
3079960	3080960	No.
3080960	3081960	You can't just see you.
3081960	3082960	Wrong laugher.
3082960	3083960	You're a wrong laugher.
3083960	3084960	Wrong.
3084960	3085960	Unreal.
3087960	3088960	Guys just want to...
3088960	3090960	Has a good time...
3090960	3092960	He's just trying to make it by...
3092960	3094960	Just trying to make it by...
3094960	3096960	Trying to make it by...
3097960	3099960	This is the only happiness in his life.
3099960	3101960	You make fun of...
3101960	3102960	Shame.
3102960	3104960	It's terrible.
3104960	3105960	Yeah.
3105960	3106960	That'll save everything.
3106960	3107960	Keep it going.
3110960	3112960	Did you just vodka-shame Dan?
3114960	3116960	Our show runs on vodka.
3116960	3117960	That's the gasoline.
3117960	3121960	William, do you think that mankind needs to be governed?
3124960	3126960	Here we go.
3127960	3128960	Depends what you mean governed.
3128960	3129960	How do you mean governed?
3129960	3130960	Not in a hot way.
3130960	3131960	Oh, right.
3131960	3133960	Not like a harness.
3134960	3137960	I mean, just like told what to do.
3137960	3138960	Yeah.
3138960	3139960	I mean, yes.
3139960	3142960	Why do you people keep calling each other governor?
3143960	3144960	All right.
3144960	3145960	All right.
3145960	3146960	Okay.
3146960	3147960	I mean, come on.
3147960	3148960	Let's take the gloves off.
3148960	3149960	Y'all can't be governor.
3149960	3151960	Y'all can't be governor.
3151960	3152960	Right.
3152960	3153960	Ding ding.
3153960	3154960	We were all thinking it.
3154960	3155960	Come on.
3155960	3156960	Oh, wait.
3157000	3159000	People are going, good morning, governor.
3159000	3160000	Good morning, governor.
3160000	3161000	You can't all be governor.
3161000	3163000	It's a term of respect.
3164000	3165000	Okay.
3165000	3166000	All right.
3166000	3167000	You shut you down right fast.
3167000	3168000	Yeah.
3168000	3169000	I could have got there by myself.
3169000	3170000	Yeah.
3170000	3171000	It's called respect.
3171000	3172000	Yeah.
3172000	3173000	Right.
3173000	3174000	Okay.
3174000	3175000	All right.
3175000	3177000	But can't you also say, like, you can ironically call somebody
3177000	3179000	gov when you're like, you're not respectable.
3179000	3180000	No one actually says it.
3180000	3181000	No?
3181000	3182000	No.
3182000	3183000	But you knew what I was talking about.
3183000	3184000	It's a stereotype.
3184000	3186000	Like how we say all Americans are idiots.
3186040	3188040	It's not true.
3188040	3190040	That's actually not a stereotype.
3190040	3191040	It's true.
3191040	3196040	It's not an absolute truth, but it's heavily backed by, like,
3196040	3198040	yeah, a lot of research.
3198040	3199040	The last 100 years.
3199040	3203040	It's an allowable statement is what it is.
3203040	3207040	I do love, I mean, you live in London, William?
3207040	3208040	Nope.
3208040	3209040	Middle of nowhere.
3209040	3210040	Middle of nowhere.
3210040	3211040	All right.
3211040	3212040	Triangle.
3212040	3213040	Triangle.
3213040	3214040	Yeah.
3214040	3215040	Yeah.
3215080	3216080	Okay.
3216080	3218080	He said triangle.
3218080	3219080	He lives in a triangle.
3219080	3220080	Why is it called triangle?
3220080	3222080	Because that's what they called it.
3222080	3225080	Why did they call it Los Angeles?
3225080	3227080	It's in the shape of a triangle.
3227080	3228080	It's because...
3228080	3229080	The city is actually...
3229080	3230080	Come on.
3230080	3231080	It's a village.
3231080	3233080	It's because they crush all the puss.
3233080	3236080	Oh.
3236080	3237080	It's callable.
3237080	3241080	They just called it crush and puss in England then.
3241080	3243080	No, I'm saying I'm translating it to you guys.
3243080	3244080	They crush all the puss, Governor.
3244120	3248120	We govern all the puss.
3248120	3250120	We govern all the puss, Governor.
3253120	3254120	Yes.
3254120	3257120	Welcome to the pink triangle where we govern all the puss.
3259120	3261120	So have you achieved...
3261120	3263120	Were you born...
3263120	3264120	Were you low born?
3264120	3265120	High born?
3265120	3266120	Mid born?
3266120	3268120	I was low mid born.
3268120	3269120	Low mid born?
3269120	3270120	Yeah.
3270160	3273160	Yes.
3273160	3276160	My low mid born friend.
3276160	3279160	I'm representing you.
3279160	3283160	Have you changed much on that scale?
3283160	3284160	Yeah.
3284160	3286160	So how does that money come in?
3286160	3287160	It's so valid.
3287160	3290160	So they take a cut, then we split it down depending on...
3290160	3292160	And they just treated it like a publishing house.
3292160	3294160	And it was your book and they published it.
3294160	3296160	Yeah, they don't even do any services like that.
3296160	3297160	They just put it on their site.
3297200	3301200	Was it strictly 100% on Steam?
3301200	3303200	Yeah, yeah.
3305200	3306200	You're rich.
3306200	3307200	Rich?
3307200	3308200	Yeah.
3308200	3309200	What do you drive?
3309200	3310200	I drive.
3310200	3311200	What's that?
3311200	3312200	I don't drive.
3312200	3313200	I don't drive.
3313200	3314200	Me neither.
3314200	3315200	But I'm not rich.
3315200	3316200	I have people.
3316200	3318200	I just wanted to hear like an Aston Martin or something.
3318200	3320200	I don't know what I was looking for.
3320200	3321200	It's so tiny there.
3321200	3322200	You can walk.
3322200	3323200	You can walk everywhere.
3323200	3325200	Yeah, you can walk to all four points.
3325240	3326240	I'm in...
3326240	3330240	All four points of the triangle.
3330240	3331240	Okay.
3331240	3332240	Yeah, yeah.
3332240	3333240	Okay.
3333240	3334240	I messed up.
3334240	3337240	He doesn't live in square.
3337240	3339240	Oh, that's what I...
3339240	3340240	I screwed up.
3340240	3341240	I screwed up.
3341240	3343240	I screwed up.
3343240	3345240	You got it, Rob.
3345240	3347240	I didn't even realize.
3347240	3351240	I thought everyone was laughing at like a United Kingdom joke.
3351240	3352240	No, no, no.
3352280	3353280	That I was like, fuck.
3353280	3356280	I'm like dumber than I thought.
3356280	3357280	No, no, no.
3357280	3358280	No, no, no.
3358280	3361280	I guess England's famous for its seven points.
3361280	3362280	No, no.
3362280	3364280	I screwed up.
3364280	3368280	I got a little stoned before the show.
3368280	3369280	You did too?
3369280	3370280	Yeah.
3370280	3372280	Why are you stoned?
3372280	3373280	I'm not stoned.
3373280	3374280	Hey, you guys.
3374280	3375280	Why?
3375280	3376280	Hey, what?
3376280	3377280	I'm talking to my...
3377280	3378280	I'm talking to mine!
3378320	3379320	All right, fine.
3379320	3380320	Okay.
3380320	3381320	Fine.
3381320	3382320	Fine.
3382320	3384320	We'll both podcast at the same time.
3384320	3385320	Yes, William?
3385320	3389320	Do you have to be a U.S. citizen to get a medical medical medical medical medical?
3389320	3392320	What is your secret for your amazing buttermilk biscuits?
3392320	3393320	California residence, brother.
3393320	3394320	It's a state thing right now, bro.
3394320	3395320	Is he making a buttermilk biscuit?
3395320	3396320	Yes.
3396320	3397320	Savory, flaky delicious.
3397320	3399320	So, do people tell you Young Tim Burton a lot?
3399320	3400320	Yeah.
3400320	3401320	Delicious.
3401320	3402320	Do you use actual buttermilk?
3402320	3405320	I try not to use milk but I...
3405360	3406360	No, you can't do it.
3406360	3407360	I'm struggling.
3407360	3409360	Have you ever met Richard Branson for Germany?
3409360	3410360	No, not at all.
3413360	3414360	I don't even think you're...
3414360	3415360	But I demanded to be toasted.
3415360	3416360	It's not good.
3416360	3419360	What has happened with Argentina?
3419360	3421360	It's always a thing on Pink Floyd albums but I never...
3421360	3423360	I can't fucking see what happened though.
3423360	3425360	I can't hear my podcast.
3425360	3426360	Just kidding about.
3426360	3427360	I'm sorry.
3431360	3432360	All right.
3435360	3442360	I feel like we should be charging people double for this show.
3442360	3445360	This is twice the podcast.
3445360	3447360	It's twice podcast.
3455360	3460360	Spencer, do you have any questions about...?
3460360	3463360	Spencer, do you have any table magic tonight?
3463360	3464360	Oh, yeah.
3464400	3467400	Does anybody have a...?
3467400	3469400	Why do you have a table?
3470400	3472400	Why do you have a table?
3472400	3474400	Because the other table's in the shop.
3474400	3475400	You don't put it...
3475400	3477400	Is it just for your water bottle?
3477400	3478400	Yeah.
3478400	3480400	Why does he have a table?
3480400	3482400	Well, I don't request a table.
3482400	3483400	You're gonna get some close to it.
3483400	3486400	Because he used to roll dice on it and then stopped three years ago.
3488400	3489400	And he said, let's...
3489400	3490400	I know one thing.
3490400	3492400	Let's keep the table.
3493400	3495400	Because we're too lazy to change our writer.
3495400	3499400	That'd be weird to have Spencer sitting in your chair down there.
3499400	3500400	Yeah.
3500400	3501400	We have the same watch.
3501400	3503400	We have the same watch.
3503400	3504400	Oh, shit.
3504400	3506400	Oh, the Milanese loop.
3506400	3508400	Wait, yeah, there we go.
3508400	3510400	What do you think of the Apple Watch?
3510400	3512400	Well, this isn't on.
3512400	3514400	It's merely a fashion statement.
3514400	3515400	I can't be asked to charge it.
3515400	3517400	Just to have one in your pocket?
3517400	3519400	Well, I was wearing it, but it annoys me.
3519400	3522400	The strap it catches in your arm has, isn't it?
3522400	3523400	Yep.
3523400	3524400	Yeah.
3524400	3525400	Fucking awful.
3525400	3526400	It's about watch.
3526400	3527400	It's like, oh, you put an iPhone on my wrist.
3527400	3530400	It reminded me that I was so happy that watches didn't have to be a thing anymore.
3530400	3531400	Yep.
3531400	3532400	I don't know.
3532400	3533400	I keep giving it a shot, though.
3533400	3535400	I keep feeling like, oh, see, there's a text.
3535400	3540400	Do you do the, like, stand up every fucking 10 times a day thing on it?
3540400	3542400	He's supposed to.
3542400	3543400	I want to turn that back on.
3543400	3544400	I turned it off.
3544400	3547400	But I find myself going like, that's all I can...
3547400	3548400	Oh, yes!
3548400	3549400	Because there's a text that I'm holding.
3549400	3551400	I think I'm like, Sarah and Erica nailed it.
3551400	3552400	Okay.
3552400	3553400	Oh, God.
3553400	3554400	Oh, God.
3554400	3555400	Oh, God.
3555400	3558400	Because you're usually holding a drink in your other hand.
3558400	3559400	Yes!
3559400	3560400	All right.
3564400	3565400	That's great.
3565400	3566400	Oh, yeah.
3566400	3567400	This is good.
3567400	3569400	Your nose works like a finger.
3569400	3570400	I love that.
3570400	3572400	It's dumb, though.
3572400	3573400	You know what?
3573400	3574400	Yeah, take it off.
3574400	3575400	I'm glad I met you tonight.
3575400	3576400	Just take it off.
3576400	3577400	This goes right here.
3577400	3578400	Fuck it!
3578400	3579400	Right in my pocket.
3579400	3580400	Nice.
3580400	3586400	In case I meet someone else that has an Apple Watch and then I'll pull it out of my pocket.
3586400	3588400	All right.
3588400	3590400	So you got rich.
3590400	3592400	You're really young.
3592400	3595400	Are you afraid of the burnout?
3595400	3597400	No, no.
3597400	3599400	You just get other people to burnout for you.
3599400	3601400	Yeah, yeah.
3601400	3603400	What are you talking about?
3603400	3605400	What's the burnout?
3605400	3606400	You've not heard of the burnout?
3606400	3607400	Oh, the mad push?
3607400	3612400	Well, burnout's a game for the PS2 called burnout.
3612400	3613400	Right.
3613400	3614400	And it's about cars.
3614400	3617400	And it's famous because all of the development team died.
3617400	3618400	Oh.
3618400	3621400	Like at once in a plane crash or what?
3621400	3622400	No, no, no, no.
3622400	3628400	They had to launch it in a really short amount of time because of publishers and stuff.
3628400	3635400	And so what happened was they had to do crunch, which is like you work like 16 to 20 hours
3635400	3636400	a day.
3636400	3640400	And what happens is they did that for like six months.
3640400	3643400	And then at the end, like within like a year, all of them had died.
3643400	3644400	Is that what?
3644400	3645400	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3645400	3646400	Really?
3646400	3647400	They called the burnout.
3647400	3648400	Is that real?
3648400	3649400	No.
3649400	3650400	No.
3650400	3658400	I felt like you were hoping there were more video game industry people in the audience
3658400	3661400	because at the point where you said they had to do crunch and you're like, cricket,
3661400	3662400	cricket.
3662400	3663400	Fuck.
3663400	3664400	All right.
3664400	3667400	Why would you be afraid of the burnout?
3667400	3674400	Because it's like they say, I don't know, prostitutes have like five good years.
3674400	3679400	And it's like that with coders because you just work.
3679400	3682400	So you work crazy hours all the time.
3682400	3684400	Oh, you're actually mentally burnout.
3684400	3685400	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3685400	3686400	I got you.
3686400	3691400	The prostitutes I know have been in the business for decades.
3691400	3697400	Perhaps you should start seeing other prostitutes.
3697400	3701400	Oh, snap.
3701400	3707400	Do not tell me how to have a good time, William.
3707400	3708400	I'm sorry.
3708400	3709400	That was.
3709400	3716400	Are there any, do you ever do role playing like sexual?
3716400	3720400	Well, yes, let's go to that right now.
3720400	3728400	Sometimes, I guess, like you do that voice when you know what going up.
3728400	3729400	Yeah.
3729400	3731400	Like, yeah, if the situation calls.
3731400	3733400	Are you in a monogamous relationship?
3733400	3734400	Are you a single?
3734400	3739400	No, I'm just all about fucking.
3739400	3744400	Now, again, it's one of these moments where people that listen to the podcast for free,
3744400	3746400	for five dollars, you can watch this podcast.
3746400	3752400	I feel like people need to know that we have a sexy 22-year-old Russell Brand game nerd.
3752400	3755400	And you're really robbing us off right now because.
3755400	3756400	Pay the money.
3756400	3760400	You can hear ovaries rattling in here right now.
3760400	3762400	Ovaries aren't supposed to rattle.
3762400	3764400	Hello, ovaries.
3764400	3766400	They're not supposed to.
3766400	3774400	It's when they get able to rattle that they get the most.
3774400	3777400	It's like a rattlesnake.
3777400	3778400	It's a warning.
3778400	3779400	It's a warning.
3779400	3781400	Well, it's a warning or an invitation depending on.
3781400	3782400	All right.
3782400	3785400	So, the.
3785400	3786400	Role playing.
3786400	3788400	So, you're all about fucking.
3788400	3790400	Wait, hold on.
3790400	3791400	Role playing.
3791400	3797400	Because I was going to talk about D&D, but he said sexual role playing, which I want to talk about.
3797400	3799400	Can we lower the lights a little bit?
3799400	3801400	Not in a monogamous relationship right now.
3801400	3804400	You're Roman and Bonin.
3804400	3805400	Coined it.
3805400	3806400	Coined it.
3806400	3807400	Coined it.
3807400	3810400	Hashtag Roman and Bonin.
3810400	3811400	Probably won't catch on.
3811400	3812400	Not that.
3812400	3813400	It's not that good.
3813400	3814400	I love Ronin and Bonin's laughing.
3814400	3816400	Did you ever see?
3816400	3820400	I like when the guy that will pop out and go, really?
3820400	3821400	Stop.
3821400	3822400	Just give me a second.
3822400	3823400	Would you?
3823400	3824400	I just want to make a good show.
3824400	3826400	Ronin and Bonin's laughing.
3826400	3827400	All right.
3827400	3829400	We'll just.
3829400	3830400	Suck it.
3830400	3837400	Have you ever during a heated, it doesn't matter if it's a one night stand, because who cares what happens after.
3837400	3843400	But the first night, you're with a person and then you're like, in the heat of the moment, we're going to do it.
3843400	3844400	We're going to do it.
3844400	3846400	And have you ever done role playing in that?
3846400	3848400	I know you've never said we're going to do it.
3848400	3849400	We're going to do it.
3849400	3852400	But have you ever said, I'm going to be a tennis instructor?
3852400	3856400	Have you ever snapped into role playing in that moment?
3856400	3857400	On the first night?
3857400	3859400	First day, yeah.
3859400	3860400	This is a question I ask anybody.
3860400	3862400	Not because you're a game designer.
3862400	3863400	Yeah.
3863400	3868400	So a lot of the time, people are bored by the answer of the question, yeah, what do you do as a job?
3868400	3871400	I'm a game designer and people aren't interested in that.
3871400	3874400	So sometimes I just lie and say, I'm an actor.
3874400	3879400	I'm a construction worker.
3879400	3882400	And then you have sex with those people and don't leave character as a construction worker.
3882400	3883400	Yeah.
3883400	3884400	So that's role playing.
3884400	3887400	Well, that's catcher of the rye role playing.
3888400	3889400	That's heavy duty shit.
3889400	3891400	You know what's a good one I've used before?
3891400	3896400	People don't believe you're a construction worker.
3896400	3902400	I manage, my father owns the company and I manage them.
3902400	3904400	That's the arms.
3904400	3908400	I don't care anymore, but when I was like, it's 9-11.
3908400	3909400	It's 9-11.
3909400	3912400	Or as we call it, twice 11.
3912400	3913400	It's twice 11.
3913400	3914400	What?
3915400	3920400	I get bored of like, so what do you do?
3920400	3921400	I got a bar.
3921400	3923400	You don't want to say you're an actor because you need to go, oh, what have you been in?
3923400	3925400	I don't want to have that conversation.
3925400	3928400	So I did a couple times.
3928400	3933400	This is a good one for guys that are just terrible people.
3933400	3939400	If you want to be a liar, say you're a high school principal and fucking adhere to it.
3939400	3941400	Say what school district you work for.
3941400	3943400	And people are like, why are you at a bar?
3943400	3946400	I'm like, because I'm the principal, baby.
3946400	3949400	I'm fucking going to blow off steam.
3949400	3954400	My high school principal wasn't tall and like, hang out at bars.
3954400	3959400	So if you really want to do it, the high school principal is sexy.
3959400	3965400	So your reward is you're either lying to a stranger the entire time and then they never know.
3965400	3971400	Or at some point they go like, come on, you're not, you've been lying to me
3971400	3974400	and I should not trust people in the future.
3974400	3982400	And you're like, just doing my part to toxify humanity.
3982400	3984400	I just don't know.
3984400	3986400	I can't picture what I was ever doing.
3986400	3989400	The first time I came to L.A. for Milwaukee, one of the first conversations I had at a bar,
3989400	3992400	because I was like, in a bar, I don't know anybody.
3992400	3996400	And in Milwaukee, you might just turn to the person next to you and go like, hey, how's it going?
3996400	4000400	And they did it in L.A. and never made this mistake again.
4000400	4001400	I was like, hey, how's it going?
4001400	4003400	And the guy's like, fine, fine.
4003400	4004400	And I'm like, nah.
4004400	4007400	So you're here to see the band?
4007400	4009400	Yes.
4009400	4011400	So what do you do?
4011400	4015400	I had no idea I was committing the fucking devil's sin.
4015400	4017400	If that's a new, coined it?
4017400	4020400	And he said, I silk-screen T-shirts.
4020400	4022400	And I said, oh, that's interesting.
4022400	4024400	So where's the silk and the screen and the thing?
4024400	4027400	And I'm like, I got a million questions about silk-screening T-shirts.
4027400	4031400	And ten minutes goes by, and then he goes, I'm just fucking with you, dude.
4031400	4037400	And I went back to my house, and I wrote movies.
4037400	4039400	And I never went out again.
4039400	4043400	I was at a bar that was nobody in with my ex-roommate from years ago,
4043400	4048400	the place that you live in, my ex-angry Irish roommate, Paul.
4048400	4050400	He was angry.
4050400	4052400	He was Irish and angry.
4052400	4053400	But a great animator.
4053400	4055400	And we were out at a bar that was at three clubs.
4055400	4056400	Nobody's in there.
4056400	4058400	I was like, can you do all?
4058400	4059400	Because he was Irish.
4059400	4061400	And I said, can you do all UK and Irish?
4061400	4062400	Can you do regional dialects?
4062400	4064400	He was like, I'm pretty good at it.
4064400	4067400	So I go, give me Aberdeen, Scotland.
4067400	4069400	And so he's doing Scottish accent.
4069400	4071400	So I was trying to mimic him and do it.
4071400	4073400	So we're just hanging out at the bar, not for anybody else.
4073400	4074400	There was nobody in there.
4074400	4077400	And so we were just talking in Scotland.
4077400	4078400	He's doing a perfect Scottish accent.
4078400	4080400	I'm trying to do it, too.
4080400	4081400	And the bartender's there.
4081400	4085400	He's heard me already speak in American English.
4085400	4087400	And he's heard this guy be Irish from Dublin.
4087400	4089400	And now we're doing Scottish.
4089400	4091400	Then the bar starts to fill up.
4091400	4093400	And all of a sudden, girls just start gravitating toward his name.
4093400	4096400	They're like, oh, your accents are so cute.
4096400	4098400	And we're just doing it like it's a joke.
4098400	4100400	We think they're going to get their drink and fuck off,
4100400	4102400	like go back to their seat or whatever.
4102400	4104400	So now there's this girl.
4104400	4105400	And she's hanging out.
4105400	4108400	And so we're doing our way from Aberdeen.
4108400	4110400	Oh, how far is Edinburgh?
4110400	4111400	I'm making it up.
4111400	4114400	It's about 50 kilometers.
4114400	4115400	I have no idea.
4115400	4116400	And she's like, oh, it's so cute.
4116400	4117400	And then she invites.
4117400	4119400	Oh, now her posse shows up.
4119400	4121400	She invites all the other girls over.
4121400	4123400	So now we're like, we've been talking to this girl thinking
4123400	4125400	she was going to leave for five minutes.
4125400	4127400	And then there's this really hot girl.
4127400	4131400	And she goes like, I really want to go home with you.
4131400	4133400	But I just have to talk to my dad first.
4133400	4137400	He's the minister of accent inspection.
4137400	4142400	And it's William Atherton in two wigs and eight glasses.
4142400	4143400	We feel bad.
4143400	4145400	We don't want to tell this girl, oh, we were just fucking
4145400	4147400	with you thinking this was a temporary bit
4147400	4150400	that you were going to go away and not hang out with two dorks
4150400	4152400	pretending to be Scottish at the bar.
4152400	4154400	And so now there's five chicks hanging out.
4154400	4155400	And the bartender's looking.
4155400	4157400	I was like, you fucking turds.
4157400	4159400	He's just like, oh, boy.
4159400	4160400	And so now we're embarrassed.
4160400	4161400	So now we're committing to it.
4161400	4164400	But now because I'm doing it and I'm getting better at it.
4164400	4168400	And so we all leave.
4168400	4170400	And finally they go away.
4170400	4172400	And I thought, OK, boy, that took a lot more.
4172400	4173400	Shoot.
4173400	4175400	We almost fucked those girls.
4181400	4183400	Dodge the boat there.
4183400	4184400	Oh, my God.
4184400	4185400	I know.
4185400	4186400	They thought we were cute.
4186400	4187400	I heard the ovaries rattling.
4187400	4189400	I knew it was a warning.
4189400	4191400	Let's say you're Scottish accent.
4191400	4192400	How do you do it?
4192400	4193400	Let's just do your Scottish accent.
4193400	4195400	Well, also, I just got a girlfriend later on.
4195400	4196400	So I'm a bit better at it.
4196400	4198400	But at the time, not that good.
4198400	4199400	I wouldn't say I'm perfect at it now.
4199400	4201400	But I can do a bit of one.
4201400	4203400	So I ended up seeing this girl.
4203400	4205400	You dodged that.
4205400	4207400	I do it.
4207400	4209400	I won't let do it, mate.
4209400	4210400	I won't let.
4210400	4212400	Do you know your wee chubby?
4215400	4216400	Your scaffey wee twat.
4216400	4223400	See, usually in the UK, the order of pecking is just Scotland.
4223400	4225400	So I just feel immediately intimidated by that.
4225400	4229400	What I love about Scottish people is that in Japanese,
4229400	4230400	people get excited.
4230400	4232400	You watch old Japanese films, and they get excited.
4232400	4233400	Ooh, they get low.
4233400	4234400	They get low.
4234400	4235400	They talk.
4235400	4236400	They get guttural.
4236400	4238400	And everyone goes, everyone's sleeping up here.
4238400	4241400	But everybody's still sleeping.
4241400	4247400	So I ended up seeing this goddamn chick every place I went for the rest of my life.
4247400	4250400	And so we spent an hour lying to her.
4250400	4253400	And she would come in, and I'd be at a bar, and I'd be with somebody.
4253400	4254400	I'd go, oh, fuck.
4254400	4255400	I'm Scottish.
4255400	4256400	Hey, how are you?
4256400	4258400	Oh, good to see you again.
4258400	4259400	And she would bring friends.
4259400	4261400	Oh, is my friend from Scotland from Aberdeen?
4261400	4262400	Oh, Jesus Christ.
4262400	4265400	And then she had friends that had been to Scotland.
4265400	4266400	They knew more about it than I did.
4266400	4267400	It was a bummer.
4267400	4269400	So finally, I was so tired.
4269400	4273400	I'm saying a fucking year goes by where I would see her every eight days.
4273400	4277400	Wherever I went, there was only like five cool bars to go to back then.
4277400	4279400	And so I would see her everywhere.
4279400	4280400	Her name was Mouse.
4280400	4281400	All right.
4281400	4282400	So I said, moose.
4282400	4285400	There was a moose-less aboot that hoose.
4285400	4287400	So, yeah, if you're Scottish, you're not.
4287400	4291400	So one day she comes in, and I was so fucking tired of this charade.
4291400	4293400	And she goes, hey, Jeff, how you doing?
4293400	4294400	I go, good.
4294400	4295400	How are you doing?
4295400	4298400	And she's like, she kind of cocks like, well, I'm good.
4298400	4299400	Like, how are things?
4299400	4300400	I'm like, things are great.
4300400	4302400	Just having a drink.
4302400	4303400	Do you know what I think?
4303400	4304400	She's like, where's your accent?
4304400	4306400	I said, look, I'm an actor.
4306400	4311400	And my acting coach told me that if you want to get rules, you can't just go in with a Scottish accent.
4311400	4316400	So I have to practice my American all the time.
4316400	4323400	Well, because I felt this is me trying to be a good person.
4323400	4325400	I was fucking with you the whole time.
4325400	4330400	For some reason, that gets me closer to the mark than I would rather you do that.
4330400	4335400	Also, I'm hoping I'm just going to move to a different state so this doesn't have to keep out.
4335400	4339400	So I go, it's better to practice it all the time.
4339400	4342400	And that way you go into the room like you're ready with your American dialect.
4342400	4345400	And she goes, OK, say something.
4345400	4346400	She's like, let's hear your American accent.
4346400	4348400	And I go, what should I say?
4348400	4350400	And she goes, I say, I want a hamburger and fries.
4350400	4352400	I go, I want a hamburger and fries.
4352400	4360400	And she looks at me and she goes, that's pretty good.
4360400	4361400	All right.
4361400	4367400	I, since years later, ran into her and told her the truth, that the whole thing was fair.
4367400	4368400	And she's here tonight.
4368400	4369400	And she's got a gun.
4369400	4370400	She's got a gun.
4370400	4371400	No, she's dead.
4371400	4372400	That woman's name?
4372400	4373400	Nancy Reagan.
4373400	4379400	Oh!
4379400	4385400	That's been our show.
4385400	4386400	Good night.
4386400	4387400	Drive safely, everybody.
4387400	4392400	Just say life's a circle.
4392400	4394400	All right, back to role playing.
4394400	4396400	Dan, where does role play for you?
4396400	4402400	What's the funkiest, the most specific role play, the most complicated design, art department,
4402400	4407400	like, set up, like, how much lead time did it have to have?
4407400	4412400	I am not at liberty to discuss my sexual role playing because it's too hot.
4412400	4416400	Are you afraid that we can't handle it?
4416400	4417400	Is that hot?
4417400	4423400	No, it's just too, I have discovered recently, after, you know, after living my life, going
4423400	4428400	like, I wish, you know, when I was on the playground, it's like, hey, hey, kid, why,
4428400	4431400	why, why, why, why you get boogers on your jacket?
4431400	4436400	How come you talk that way, walk that way, and pee that way, and throw a ball that way,
4436400	4439400	and write that way, and talk that way, and think that way?
4439400	4442400	How come I smell that way, and behave in all that way?
4442400	4443400	Why are you doing all those things?
4443400	4444400	Why are you doing that?
4444400	4447400	And I'd always be like, fuck, god damn, it's such a bummer.
4447400	4449400	All that happens, and I'm like, fuck, god damn it.
4449400	4452400	I'm going to make sure that the answer to that is always because I'm awesome.
4452400	4456400	And I'm just, like, just getting more and more taste of it and just going like, no,
4456400	4458400	you're going to fucking kneel before me.
4458400	4462400	And then I was like, the answer is going to be, why aren't you doing this this way
4462400	4463400	and that way and that way?
4463400	4466400	And then along the way, it was sort of, like, caught up in this sort of, like, well,
4466400	4471400	the big key to that is, like, public, you know, spotlight, transparency.
4471400	4476400	Like, there should be no barrier between your, what's going on in your head
4476400	4479400	and what's coming out of your mouth and what's going on behind closed doors,
4479400	4482400	because that's everybody else's jam, because they're all ashamed of themselves.
4482400	4483400	And they're all terrible people.
4483400	4484400	They're shadow people.
4484400	4486400	And they want you to be merged with their shadows.
4486400	4487400	And you're just going to be honest.
4487400	4488400	You're going to be who you are.
4488400	4489400	And you're going to flaunt who you are.
4489400	4491400	And they're going to not kill you.
4491400	4493400	And that's when you're going to know you succeed.
4493400	4495400	Then I spent my life, like, tricking people into situations
4495400	4498400	where they're tempted to try to kill me so I can prove that they can't,
4498400	4500400	so I can be alive and consider myself a success.
4500400	4502400	And it's just this fucking syndrome.
4502400	4508400	And then I, you know, and it culminated in a, like, a public relationship.
4508400	4509400	And I got married.
4509400	4510400	And, like, now I'm divorced.
4510400	4513400	And it was, like, we, like, none of it matters.
4514400	4517400	And then I go, like, oh, what if where you put your dick
4517400	4519400	and what you did with it and what made it hard
4519400	4521400	and when it came and where you shot the cum,
4521400	4524400	like, what if that was, like, kind of, like, I don't know.
4524400	4527400	What if there was a little bit of a box around that?
4527400	4529400	What if you made a box around here?
4529400	4532400	And what if everybody that you knew intimately,
4532400	4534400	like, there was a box around them?
4534400	4537400	And it's like, oh, I guess that would be called privacy.
4537400	4542400	And then you can still, like, yeah, I mean, I wish.
4542400	4545400	I want nothing more than to be able to tell people, like,
4545400	4547400	like, what I get up to when I fuck.
4547400	4552400	But the fact is, society couldn't handle it.
4552400	4554400	And that's why I'm able to cum.
4554400	4556400	That's the only thing that could ever make me cum.
4556400	4559400	So if I told you, you'd be like, whoa.
4559400	4562400	And then I'd be like, and then my dick would be like, meh.
4562400	4564400	So then I'd have to go further.
4564400	4566400	And then I'd be like, I'm hard.
4566400	4567400	And you'd be like, that's crazy.
4567400	4570400	And I'm like, yep, it was.
4570400	4572400	And so I'm in a sweet spot.
4572400	4573400	And I got some tricks.
4573400	4575400	I got some costumes.
4575400	4578400	I admire you having that privacy for yourself.
4578400	4579400	That's good.
4579400	4581400	Your sexuality should be sexy.
4581400	4583400	And it should be your own dirty little secret.
4583400	4585400	I go to criminal places.
4585400	4590400	Terrible, low, ethically horrible places.
4590400	4593400	I'm not coming until like.
4593400	4594400	I hate crime.
4594400	4595400	Well, that's not true.
4595400	4597400	I can tell you.
4597400	4599400	All the time, I just want to make sure.
4599400	4602400	Because it's like, well, what if you can only go to that place?
4602400	4603400	No.
4603400	4608400	But I'm saying, I go to terrible, terrible, dark, dark crevices
4608400	4610400	of the human imagination.
4614400	4616400	Because you're not supposed to.
4616400	4619400	But with somebody who's consensually into that too.
4619400	4620400	No.
4620400	4621400	God, no.
4621400	4622400	Consent?
4622400	4623400	No.
4623400	4624400	No.
4624400	4625400	Oh, God, no.
4625400	4626400	Jeff, that's the whole point.
4626400	4627400	Yes, yes.
4630400	4632400	With a consent to good dolls.
4635400	4637400	Yes, but it's horrible.
4637400	4640400	And there's really no way it never wouldn't be horrible.
4640400	4642400	Like, that's a thing.
4642400	4645400	It's like, oh, let's all live in this society where we all kind
4645400	4646400	of talk about everything.
4646400	4648400	And all the language is monitored.
4648400	4650400	And if you say this, then you intend this.
4650400	4651400	But that's not really true.
4651400	4653400	Because we know that the people that are really good at saying
4653400	4655400	things right are some of the worst people in the world.
4655400	4657400	And then we're down here policing each other's language
4657400	4659400	because we're so caught up in the idea of language being
4659400	4660400	intent.
4660400	4662400	But we're still disguising it down here.
4662400	4664400	Because when you get behind closed doors, it's all about,
4664400	4667400	it's thought and it's intent and stuff.
4667400	4670400	And it's like, the way you treat each other, it should be,
4670400	4672400	I don't know where to go with that.
4672400	4675400	But it's a lot of babysitter stuff.
4679400	4680400	That's the short answer.
4680400	4681400	The short answer is babysitter.
4681400	4683400	The short answer is it's a lot of babysitter stuff.
4684400	4687400	But, you know, let's be on that.
4689400	4690400	That's the baseline.
4690400	4692400	Thanks for taking care of my kids.
4692400	4694400	Have you ever dressed up either yourself or your...
4694400	4695400	My wife's working at the hospital.
4695400	4698400	Have you ever dressed up as yourself or your leva,
4698400	4701400	as you call her, in period costume?
4701400	4703400	Have you ever gone into a different era?
4706400	4708400	Well, yes, the 80s.
4709400	4710400	Whoo!
4711400	4712400	Yes.
4714400	4716400	Yes, it's my high school, yes.
4716400	4718400	Yeah, that's good. I like that.
4719400	4722400	But, no, nothing, no dangerous liaison.
4722400	4725400	It's kind of like, oh, Oscar-worthy stuff, yes.
4725400	4728400	William, do you go into the costume realm?
4728400	4732400	Yeah, well, as an actor, what I get is I get the...
4732400	4734400	What's your favorite film that you've been in?
4734400	4737400	Oh, The Independence Day.
4737400	4738400	All right.
4738400	4740400	See, we're role-playing right now.
4740400	4742400	The Independence Day.
4742400	4743400	Yeah, The Independence...
4743400	4744400	Is that what I get?
4744400	4745400	Yeah.
4745400	4746400	The British.
4746400	4747400	Yeah.
4749400	4751400	How did people in England...
4751400	4754400	That was a hit movie, I'm assuming it was kind of a global...
4754400	4758400	Somebody in London must have wanted to go see Independence Day.
4758400	4761400	Well, you were not born for 80 years.
4761400	4763400	So, I guess I'm not... I'm asking the wrong person,
4763400	4764400	but I'm just curious.
4764400	4766400	They're like, oh, there's another American...
4766400	4768400	There's another American explosion movie.
4768400	4771400	And then it's just like, this is our Independence Day.
4771400	4774400	I'm like, well, all right.
4774400	4775400	Yeah.
4775400	4776400	Rub it in.
4776400	4780400	I mean, can't aliens attack and it not be about this fucking thing you keep bringing up?
4780400	4783400	We used to rule the world down.
4783400	4784400	Not anymore.
4784400	4785400	Like those aliens.
4785400	4786400	Yeah.
4786400	4790400	The aliens were a allegory for the British.
4790400	4792400	But don't you think the British pilots,
4792400	4795400	because weren't there a bunch of international pilots on that tarmac?
4795400	4797400	When Bill Pullman's making the speech of that movie,
4797400	4799400	isn't there like a good...
4799400	4803400	They should have a shot of like 20 British guys pulling off flight helmets
4803400	4804400	and going like, you know what?
4804400	4807400	If you're going to make it fucking complicated for us...
4807400	4808400	And also, he's heading...
4808400	4810400	Can I sign on to this allegory?
4810400	4813400	And that scene is absolutely ripping off Shakespeare
4813400	4814400	because that's the St. Crispin's Day speech.
4814400	4815400	Oh, yeah.
4815400	4816400	So, like, yeah.
4816400	4818400	That's in your face, England.
4819400	4820400	Hey.
4820400	4821400	No, I'm on your side.
4821400	4824400	I think that's us needlessly rubbing it in.
4824400	4825400	Yeah.
4825400	4828400	Did you know that Shakespeare invented the word eyeball?
4829400	4830400	Oh, God.
4830400	4832400	He's going to bring this up again.
4834400	4835400	You guys are stepping on each other.
4835400	4836400	Is that true?
4836400	4837400	Yes.
4837400	4839400	Yeah, is it true?
4839400	4840400	Yes.
4840400	4841400	Eyeball.
4841400	4842400	Is that right?
4842400	4843400	Didn't he make up the word bump?
4843400	4844400	Bump?
4844400	4845400	Yes, yes.
4845400	4846400	Bump.
4846400	4847400	Amazement.
4847400	4848400	Compromise.
4848400	4849400	Uncomfortable.
4849400	4852400	Uncomfortable, except comfortable already existed, so...
4852400	4853400	Personal credit.
4853400	4856400	This is a promotion for my new show, Great Minds, on the History Channel.
4862400	4865400	Here's my beef with Shakespeare.
4865400	4867400	Because of iambic pentameter...
4867400	4868400	Here we go.
4868400	4872400	Because of iambic pentameter's strict rules,
4872400	4875400	it has to be Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art the Romeo.
4875400	4876400	It's Romeo.
4876400	4879400	But you can't say Romeo because it fucks up the iambic pentameter.
4880400	4882400	No one wants to say Romeo.
4882400	4883400	They're from Italy.
4883400	4884400	They're from Italy.
4884400	4885400	No one in Italy calls it...
4885400	4888400	Yeah, if they would have called it Romeo, it would have been famous.
4893400	4894400	It would have been huge.
4894400	4895400	They would have got that right.
4895400	4897400	Rob, back to your biscuits.
4898400	4899400	Delicious.
4899400	4900400	You say you put jam on them.
4900400	4902400	I think they're fine just on their own.
4902400	4904400	I don't think it needs any help.
4904400	4906400	They are quite good, if you heat them up.
4906400	4908400	What do you set the oven to?
4908400	4911400	Great Minds on History Channel.
4913400	4914400	425.
4914400	4916400	It's a good show.
4916400	4917400	We don't have it.
4917400	4919400	Spencer's Great Minds on History.
4919400	4920400	Let's roll the clip.
4920400	4921400	Watch Great Minds on History.
4921400	4922400	Yeah, let's roll the clip.
4922400	4923400	Let's roll the clip.
4923400	4924400	Roll the clip.
4924400	4925400	Let's roll the clip.
4925400	4926400	What are we watching?
4926400	4928400	You want to set up the clip?
4928400	4930400	Yeah, this is episode six.
4930400	4933400	We go into the center of the earth.
4933400	4934400	Play the clip.
4934400	4936400	Fade out, fade down, fade down.
4936400	4943400	Oh, this is a time machine situation mishap.
4943400	4947400	Spencer, why are we at the center of the earth?
4947400	4949400	Every time we go to the...
4949400	4951400	This happens every time.
4954400	4956400	Oh, look out the window.
4956400	4958400	There's a historical figure.
4958400	4960400	Why is he down there?
4960400	4962400	It looks like it's...
4962400	4963400	He's bald.
4963400	4965400	It's Billy Zane.
4965400	4970400	Someone called out, it's Billy Zane.
4970400	4973400	I guess Billy Zane is out there.
4973400	4977400	We can do this the easy way or the hard way.
4977400	4981400	He's doing his line from Back to the Future 3.
4981400	4983400	Hold on, William.
4983400	4985400	You're going to get a part.
4985400	4989400	I've only seen 14 episodes of Harmonton.
4989400	4990400	Oh, no, it's okay.
4990400	4991400	You don't have to be a fan.
4991400	4994400	You've clearly set up a bit.
4994400	4996400	And I don't know what the bit is.
4996400	4997400	I'm sorry.
4997400	4998400	And now I'm interrupting it.
4998400	4999400	No, I know.
4999400	5000400	No, I'll catch it.
5000400	5001400	I'll catch it up.
5001400	5002400	It's just bad improv.
5002400	5003400	There's nothing more.
5003400	5005400	We're going to give you a historical figure to play.
5005400	5009400	If you could play any character from history, anybody at all, who would it be?
5009400	5010400	Margaret Thatcher.
5010400	5011400	Okay.
5011400	5013400	I fucking knew it.
5013400	5014400	I knew it.
5014400	5015400	The Iron Lady.
5015400	5016400	Yes.
5016400	5017400	Yes.
5017400	5018400	All right.
5018400	5019400	All right.
5019400	5020400	So we'll cue you.
5020400	5022400	You'll know when you're coming into the scene.
5022400	5024400	Think of it like it's a radio play.
5024400	5025400	Oh, this is a warm embrace.
5025400	5026400	Thank you.
5028400	5029400	All right.
5029400	5030400	So we're in a drill.
5030400	5031400	We're at the center of the earth.
5031400	5032400	We just saw Billy Zane.
5032400	5035400	Look what's right next to Billy Zane.
5035400	5037400	Is that the Iron Lady?
5040400	5042400	Let's listen and see what she's saying.
5042400	5043400	Hello.
5047400	5048400	She's drowning.
5048400	5049400	We should pick her up.
5049400	5050400	Oh, thanks.
5050400	5051400	Yeah.
5051400	5052400	Yeah.
5052400	5053400	Thank you.
5053400	5054400	Get in here, Iron Lady.
5054400	5055400	Oh, yeah.
5055400	5056400	All right.
5056400	5059400	Strap into the cargo bay.
5059400	5063400	I'm strapping the fucking right now.
5063400	5065400	Let's get you back up topside.
5065400	5068400	Oh, I guess I don't need any help.
5075400	5078400	You just left Billy Zane in the center of the earth.
5078400	5081400	There's only three seats in the center of the earth.
5081400	5082400	That's fine.
5082400	5083400	All right.
5083400	5084400	All right.
5084400	5085400	Here we are back.
5085400	5088400	I was in the fifth season.
5088400	5092400	Spencer, either you have to get out with Margaret Thatcher,
5092400	5095400	and I'll go back down and get Billy Zane.
5095400	5097400	Or I'll...
5097400	5101400	You leave the fox with the chicken feed.
5101400	5102400	Why don't you...
5102400	5105400	Will you go down and get Billy Zane?
5105400	5106400	Oh, yeah.
5106400	5107400	I'll be right back.
5107400	5108400	You guys sit here.
5108400	5110400	I'll drive off in the mobile.
5110400	5111400	All right.
5111400	5114400	I smell double podcast coming on right now.
5114400	5119400	It looks like we've come up above ground here in Kentucky.
5119400	5120400	Yeah.
5120400	5123400	Margaret Thatcher, you look terrible.
5123400	5125400	Oh, cool.
5125400	5126400	No, you've been...
5126400	5127400	I mean, you've been through a lot.
5127400	5128400	Oh, yeah.
5128400	5129400	Yeah.
5129400	5130400	Let's get you...
5130400	5132400	Let's get you clothed and fed.
5132400	5133400	I am clothed.
5133400	5135400	What are you talking about?
5136400	5138400	Let's get you a new change of clothes.
5138400	5140400	It's not all lava and dirt it up,
5140400	5143400	and then we'll go get you some food.
5143400	5144400	Oh, thanks.
5144400	5145400	Thank you.
5145400	5146400	Click clop.
5146400	5147400	Click clop.
5147400	5148400	Click clop.
5148400	5152400	Billy Zane, are you down here?
5152400	5153400	Help me.
5153400	5154400	I...
5154400	5155400	Dear God, help me.
5155400	5156400	We're...
5156400	5157400	I'm...
5157400	5158400	Help me, please.
5158400	5161400	Help me, please.
5161400	5164400	They left me behind.
5164400	5167400	Help me, my leg's broken.
5167400	5169400	My bone's sticking out of my leg.
5169400	5170400	It hurts so much.
5170400	5171400	Help me, please.
5171400	5172400	Help me.
5172400	5173400	Why were...
5173400	5174400	If that was the case,
5174400	5176400	why were you just quoting earlier lines you've done
5176400	5177400	the last time I counted you?
5177400	5179400	I'm delirious for the pain.
5181400	5182400	Fair point.
5182400	5183400	You're questioning me.
5183400	5185400	The bone is sticking out of my leg.
5185400	5186400	It sure is.
5186400	5189400	You don't like how I was speaking before when you left me?
5189400	5190400	Yeah, no.
5190400	5194400	It's really souring my benevolence here.
5194400	5195400	I'm gonna...
5195400	5196400	Please.
5196400	5197400	I'm gonna get out of here.
5197400	5198400	No.
5198400	5201400	You're gonna leave me a second time.
5201400	5202400	Please, help me.
5202400	5203400	I'm Billy Zane.
5203400	5204400	See ya.
5204400	5207400	I loved you on season six.
5207400	5210400	Shit.
5210400	5214400	Meanwhile, at Abercrombie and Fitch,
5214400	5218400	why would I stammer and find Fitch?
5218400	5220400	What was I gonna beat, Fitch?
5220400	5222400	Abercrombie and Diamond.
5222400	5223400	What was I gonna...
5223400	5225400	I was gonna beat Fitch.
5225400	5227400	Fucking idiot.
5227400	5229400	Meanwhile, at Abercrombie and Fitch.
5229400	5231400	So, yeah, that looks great on you.
5231400	5233400	No, no, I think I prefer the blue one, actually, you know.
5233400	5234400	All right.
5234400	5235400	Well, let's go.
5235400	5236400	Excuse me.
5236400	5238400	I hope I don't interrupt you,
5238400	5240400	but we're about to close the store.
5240400	5242400	Look, we're gonna need a bit more time, all right?
5242400	5243400	All right.
5243400	5244400	Well, here's the keys.
5244400	5247400	Oh, thanks.
5247400	5250400	Turn the lights off and lock the door.
5250400	5251400	Yeah, all right, all right.
5251400	5252400	Okay.
5252400	5255400	And make sure no one steals all this money that I laid out.
5255400	5256400	Oh, no, no, no, no problem.
5256400	5259400	They laid out all the ones and fives
5259400	5262400	and tens and twenties and fifties.
5262400	5263400	Yeah.
5263400	5264400	All on the table.
5264400	5265400	No, we'll be real responsible.
5265400	5268400	Please, don't let anyone steal it
5268400	5270400	and put it in, like, these trash bags
5270400	5271400	that are right next to...
5271400	5272400	All right.
5272400	5273400	Yeah.
5273400	5275400	So, please, so keep those keys.
5276400	5277400	I'm just gonna walk home
5277400	5280400	because it's too hard to take my car key off of them.
5280400	5281400	I'm just gonna walk home.
5281400	5282400	All right.
5282400	5284400	So, okay.
5284400	5286400	You look like good people.
5286400	5289400	Okay, so that's been elaborately set up,
5289400	5291400	so we're gonna fucking case this joint.
5291400	5292400	Maggie.
5292400	5293400	Yeah, what?
5293400	5294400	What?
5294400	5295400	He just put his trust in us.
5295400	5296400	What a girl wants.
5296400	5298400	What a girl needs.
5298400	5299400	What a kind of trust in me.
5299400	5301400	Montage.
5301400	5303400	Montage of trying on clothes
5303400	5305400	and then stealing things.
5305400	5307400	Margaret Thatcher!
5307400	5309400	You're corrupting me!
5309400	5312400	Yeah, I corrupted the fucking British morale,
5312400	5316400	but, you know, I won't give a fuck about that.
5316400	5318400	Shots fired!
5320400	5321400	All right.
5321400	5323400	It all culminates in us finishing
5323400	5325400	filling up bags with cash,
5325400	5327400	and also you come out of the dressing room
5327400	5329400	in the perfect dress, and I'm like,
5329400	5331400	that's the one.
5332400	5333400	And then, and then, and then,
5333400	5335400	and then we run out to the parking lot,
5335400	5336400	and we...
5336400	5337400	Oh, I just forgot my lunchbox, but...
5337400	5339400	Oh, shh.
5341400	5342400	What the heck?
5342400	5343400	You got...
5343400	5344400	I'm just peeing.
5344400	5345400	I think I...
5345400	5346400	All right, then.
5346400	5347400	You're gonna have to fucking take this person out.
5347400	5348400	No, Margaret.
5348400	5350400	These are the trash bags that I left there,
5350400	5351400	and what's inside?
5351400	5352400	You gotta waste this fool.
5352400	5353400	All of the 50s and 50s.
5353400	5355400	Waste this fool!
5357400	5359400	Hot piano wire that I stole
5359400	5361400	from the piano section of your store.
5362400	5363400	Around your throat.
5363400	5364400	Around your throat.
5364400	5366400	My neck is over there.
5368400	5369400	What?
5369400	5371400	You're some kind of magician.
5375400	5376400	Oh.
5376400	5378400	Oh, my gosh.
5378400	5379400	Oh, my gosh.
5379400	5380400	Oh, my gosh.
5380400	5381400	What are you doing?
5381400	5384400	Well, I'm choking you to death.
5386400	5388400	I'm being choked.
5388400	5391400	He's imagining you're in front of him right now.
5391400	5392400	Okay, all right.
5392400	5393400	Okay.
5393400	5396400	Why would you steal my money after that?
5396400	5399400	Why are you killing me when I caught you?
5399400	5401400	I trusted you.
5401400	5403400	I trusted you.
5406400	5409400	Yes, that's why you don't buy piano wires
5409400	5411400	at Abercrombie and Fitch.
5414400	5417400	You can't kill somebody with those.
5417400	5418400	All right.
5418400	5420400	Margaret Thatcher.
5420400	5421400	Go kneel behind him,
5421400	5423400	and I'll push you over his back
5423400	5424400	on the count of three,
5424400	5426400	and then we'll run,
5426400	5428400	because he'll have fallen down.
5428400	5433400	So, anyways, just out here stargazing and...
5436400	5437400	Billy Zane!
5437400	5438400	Yes!
5438400	5447400	It took 11 minutes for me to crawl up here,
5447400	5450400	but I'm finally going to give my revenge
5450400	5453400	on you, Margaret Thatcher, for breaking my heart.
5453400	5455400	Oh, fucking hell.
5455400	5456400	Yes.
5456400	5458400	That's what we're going to do.
5458400	5459400	What?
5459400	5461400	Come with me, Margaret Thatcher.
5461400	5462400	Oh, no.
5462400	5464400	They're going to fucking hell.
5464400	5467400	Later in hell.
5468400	5470400	Yes!
5479400	5481400	These are your legs.
5481400	5483400	Oh, yes.
5483400	5486400	Invade me like the Falkland Islands.
5486400	5488400	Yes!
5488400	5490400	Oh, yeah.
5491400	5492400	And I'm the devil,
5492400	5494400	and I'm whipping you both,
5495400	5496400	and I'm like,
5496400	5497400	yeah!
5497400	5500400	Keep fucking!
5500400	5503400	And I'm kind of like getting suspicious.
5503400	5505400	I'm like, wait a minute.
5506400	5509400	Who's taking advantage of who here?
5509400	5514400	Keep fucking Billy Zane, Margaret Thatcher.
5518400	5520400	And then I walk back...
5520400	5523400	I'm walking...
5523400	5527400	I'm walking back to my devil office,
5527400	5529400	and I'm like demoralized.
5529400	5531400	I'm like, I don't even know.
5531400	5533400	Hey, honey, why you look so blue?
5533400	5536400	Stephanie, could you hold all my calls?
5536400	5539400	Okay, but you have a full inbox of, you know,
5539400	5541400	a lot of important devil things to do.
5541400	5542400	Yeah, but could you come in?
5542400	5544400	Just come in my office and just hear me out.
5544400	5545400	Okay, this isn't going to be one of your...
5545400	5546400	No, no, no.
5546400	5547400	I swear to God.
5547400	5550400	Ever since that lawyer came, like, I don't...
5550400	5552400	We had the whole HR seminar about this.
5552400	5553400	No, I get it.
5553400	5554400	It's an unfair power dynamic.
5554400	5555400	That's the whole point.
5555400	5556400	I can't even go there.
5556400	5557400	No matter how many signals you send me,
5557400	5558400	it's like, it's unfair to you.
5558400	5559400	It's not going to happen.
5559400	5560400	I'm in love with Roderick.
5560400	5561400	It's fine.
5561400	5562400	That's fine.
5562400	5564400	Please don't ever say that again or I'll fire you.
5564400	5566400	See, that's exactly why...
5566400	5567400	I'm sorry.
5567400	5568400	I'm sorry.
5568400	5569400	You didn't hear that.
5569400	5570400	I'm coming into the office.
5570400	5571400	I will never fire you.
5571400	5572400	Fuck.
5572400	5573400	I'm sitting over here.
5573400	5574400	Stephanie...
5574400	5575400	Oh, I'm sorry.
5575400	5579400	My high heel just popped off the heel of my...
5580400	5581400	Let me...
5581400	5585400	Let me pop that back on before it dangles there for a while.
5585400	5586400	Oops.
5586400	5587400	There she goes again.
5587400	5589400	Can I pop it back here?
5589400	5590400	No.
5590400	5591400	Pop.
5592400	5594400	Dangle, dangle, dangle, dangle, dangle.
5597400	5598400	What is it?
5598400	5599400	What's on your mind?
5600400	5601400	Dangle.
5605400	5606400	Stephanie...
5606400	5607400	Yes?
5607400	5609400	I've got two things to say to you.
5609400	5610400	What is it, devil?
5612400	5616400	I think you lost your shoe and you're fired.
5616400	5617400	No, that didn't make me a hero.
5617400	5618400	Okay.
5620400	5621400	You know what, Stephanie, don't.
5621400	5622400	You're not fired.
5622400	5623400	You brought me in the office.
5623400	5624400	I'm assuming for a reason.
5624400	5625400	I've got a lot of work to do.
5625400	5629400	I don't feel like hell is working.
5629400	5632400	You used to have an edge because you go out there,
5632400	5634400	you're whipping people that enjoy it.
5634400	5636400	I think a lot of people are having more fun in hell
5636400	5637400	than in heaven.
5637400	5640400	And I think maybe that you're not like a devil,
5640400	5645400	maybe you're secretly, you're like a god.
5645400	5646400	Well, doi.
5648400	5649400	Don't diminish me.
5649400	5651400	I was an angel that loved God too much.
5651400	5652400	I got fired from heaven.
5652400	5653400	I don't know.
5653400	5655400	I'm in hell and I'm like fucking like...
5655400	5656400	Guess what?
5656400	5657400	It's gotten big.
5659400	5661400	It's running without me and it's a bummer.
5662400	5665400	I just got done whipping politicians from...
5665400	5666400	Someone's at the door.
5666400	5667400	Oh, okay.
5667400	5668400	Should I get that?
5668400	5669400	You said hold your calls.
5669400	5670400	I'll open it.
5670400	5671400	Okay.
5671400	5672400	Hello?
5672400	5673400	Hey, it's me, Pinhead.
5674400	5677400	I hate to be a dick with a copy machine,
5677400	5681400	just still does not have enough toner in it.
5682400	5683400	I'm sorry, Stephanie.
5683400	5684400	I mean, come on.
5684400	5685400	I know.
5685400	5688400	I promised Pinhead a long time ago that all his IT problems,
5688400	5690400	the buck would stop with me.
5692400	5694400	It's just ink toner.
5694400	5695400	It's just ink toner.
5695400	5696400	Boss, devil.
5696400	5697400	It's just ink toner.
5697400	5700400	You need to learn to relegate like things,
5700400	5704400	like to delegate or delegate and relegate.
5704400	5707400	I don't care if you relegate or delegate.
5707400	5709400	Get some shit in here.
5709400	5710400	Pinhead, Pinhead.
5710400	5711400	You'll copy my shit.
5711400	5712400	Pinhead, we talked about your attitude.
5712400	5713400	So I can copy my shit.
5713400	5714400	Pinhead.
5714400	5716400	So I can copy my shit.
5717400	5718400	Fuck this job.
5718400	5719400	Pinhead.
5722400	5723400	Great, great.
5723400	5725400	Now he's dissolved through a portal.
5726400	5730400	I ain't fucking dealing with this shit no more.
5731400	5732400	We can only hear him in the walls.
5732400	5733400	The scene opens the door.
5733400	5734400	Later at a bar.
5734400	5737400	Oh, Pinhead, you seem more confident than normal.
5737400	5741400	Yeah, well, I told my boss to go fuck himself.
5742400	5743400	Why don't we drink it?
5743400	5744400	You want the usual?
5744400	5746400	Give me two of the usual.
5746400	5747400	All right.
5747400	5749400	Make that one on me.
5749400	5751400	Oh, shit.
5754400	5756400	Nicole Kidman.
5760400	5763400	As I live and breathe.
5763400	5766400	Hey, hey, Kidman, I told you never to come back to this bar.
5766400	5768400	Get the fuck out of here, Kidman.
5768400	5774400	You didn't tell me I couldn't come in and buy people drinks.
5774400	5775400	I'm leaving, I'm leaving.
5775400	5777400	I'm turning into a bat.
5777400	5779400	Fucking, fucking Kidman.
5779400	5781400	That fucking Nicole Kidman.
5781400	5782400	Nicole Kidman.
5782400	5784400	All over my good time.
5784400	5786400	All I get is just grief.
5786400	5787400	Grief.
5787400	5789400	Do you know how hard I work at this job?
5789400	5791400	You work pretty hard on this motherfucker.
5791400	5794400	I work 16-hour crunches.
5796400	5797400	Too much, man.
5797400	5798400	Too much.
5798400	5799400	Burning out.
5799400	5801400	I'm burning out and I'm in hell.
5802400	5805400	You got to learn to smell.
5807400	5809400	I hadn't thought about that.
5809400	5811400	I hadn't thought about that.
5811400	5813400	Wait, Pinhead, what are you going to do now?
5813400	5814400	You're out of a job, man.
5814400	5816400	You guys got to work.
5816400	5819400	Butterball and I, we're getting together.
5819400	5821400	We got this new, like...
5821400	5822400	You still hang out with all the Cenobites?
5822400	5823400	You guys all hang out?
5823400	5825400	Well, Christmas cards for most of them.
5825400	5827400	But Butterball and I are still tight.
5827400	5830400	We went to college together, you know.
5830400	5838400	But, you know, we've been working on this new type of way
5838400	5841400	to make, like, ceramics.
5841400	5842400	For real?
5842400	5843400	Yeah, yeah.
5843400	5844400	It's new.
5844400	5846400	It's all, you know, like, healthy.
5846400	5848400	Because as it stands right now, ceramics is an old,
5848400	5851400	very time-consuming, labor-intensive process.
5851400	5854400	No, we do it in half the time, half the cost.
5854400	5855400	Right.
5855400	5857400	That's what it says on the box.
5857400	5859400	Half the time, half the cost.
5859400	5863400	You don't have to be waiting for it to get out of the oven.
5863400	5866400	Can I get into the ground floor of this?
5866400	5867400	I'll sell the bar.
5867400	5868400	I'll get into you.
5868400	5869400	Can I?
5869400	5872400	Well, I was going to say you've got the pizza oven there,
5872400	5874400	and we can move the video game over there.
5874400	5876400	We've got ourselves a business.
5876400	5878400	We make the ceramics right here in the bar.
5878400	5879400	Right.
5879400	5880400	Right.
5880400	5882400	Moving up in the world.
5882400	5884400	It's a montage to this song.
5884400	5885400	Moving up in the world.
5885400	5887400	You make ceramics all day long.
5887400	5889400	I got the money, money.
5889400	5891400	Baby, times are changing all the time.
5891400	5893400	I got ceramics all the time.
5893400	5898400	And there's a graph showing the ceramic sales going up.
5898400	5903400	And the bartender and pinhead are being showered with coins.
5903400	5905400	Yeah, still a montage of people buying ceramic.
5905400	5907400	Yeah, just people buying ceramic.
5907400	5909400	Oh, I like that money.
5909400	5911400	All that money goes around.
5911400	5912400	I got that money.
5912400	5913400	Oh, boy.
5913400	5914400	Shopping carts full of aces.
5914400	5916400	And then, yeah, OK.
5916400	5917400	We've got so much money.
5917400	5918400	Look at all this money.
5918400	5921400	Can I talk to you, man to man?
5921400	5922400	OK.
5922400	5923400	Let me close the drapes.
5923400	5925400	OK.
5925400	5928400	I feel like I'm doing all the heavy lifting here, Pinhead.
5928400	5931400	I feel like, you know, you're the idea, man.
5931400	5933400	But who's doing all the day to day?
5933400	5935400	My idea.
5935400	5938400	We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for my idea.
5938400	5940400	Yeah, but we wouldn't be here if it weren't
5940400	5942400	for all my fucking blood, sweat, and tears.
5942400	5945400	OK, so 50-50.
5945400	5948400	No, I'm actually taking a...
5949400	5952400	Somebody's opening the drape.
5952400	5954400	Oh, the drapes are opening.
5957400	5959400	Should have locked the drapes.
5959400	5961400	What are you guys talking about?
5961400	5964400	Nicole, can we have one?
5964400	5965400	Just asking.
5965400	5967400	OK.
5967400	5969400	I'm on my way to an audition.
5972400	5974400	You guys have been giving Nicole the shoulder lately.
5974400	5975400	No, no, no, no.
5975400	5976400	Come in, come in.
5976400	5977400	What is it?
5977400	5980400	Should I divorce Tom Cruise?
5981400	5983400	I mean, do you love him?
5983400	5984400	Oh, shit.
5984400	5985400	I'll get it, I'll get it.
5985400	5988400	Get the back drapes, something for the back drapes.
5990400	5991400	Hello, Nicole.
5991400	5992400	It's Tom.
5992400	5993400	Tom?
5994400	5995400	Oh, shit.
5995400	5996400	Pinhead, we should leave.
5996400	5997400	We should leave.
5997400	5998400	Let's let them talk.
5998400	6000400	No, no, stay.
6000400	6002400	Tom, whatever you have to say to me,
6002400	6004400	you can say in front of my friends.
6008400	6013400	You hurt me well enough in front of everyone.
6014400	6016400	You can't leave me, Nicole.
6016400	6019400	No, that's the problem, Tom.
6019400	6021400	The problem for you.
6021400	6023400	It's that I can.
6023400	6025400	I'll clean it up and tighten it later.
6028400	6031400	Didn't they get divorced like 20 years ago?
6032400	6035400	This is set in the 80s.
6035400	6036400	This is set in the 80s.
6036400	6037400	This is the whole movie.
6037400	6038400	All right.
6038400	6039400	In the 90s?
6039400	6040400	All right.
6040400	6043400	Listen, I love you, Nicole.
6044400	6047400	Yeah, for all intents and purposes, I love you.
6049400	6051400	That's what I'm afraid of.
6052400	6054400	Don't be afraid, Nicole.
6054400	6055400	But...
6059400	6060400	About what?
6060400	6061400	But what...
6061400	6062400	But what...
6065400	6066400	But what what...
6073400	6074400	What?
6074400	6075400	But...
6075400	6076400	What?
6076400	6077400	But...
6077400	6078400	Are we allowed to leave now?
6078400	6079400	Or can we do...
6079400	6080400	Stay.
6080400	6081400	I just...
6081400	6084400	Anything Nicole has to say to me,
6084400	6086400	she can say in front of you.
6086400	6088400	There's no forward progress in this conversation.
6088400	6090400	You guys have to communicate with each other.
6090400	6092400	What did I do to you, Nicole?
6092400	6095400	You're a bigger fool than I thought if you don't know.
6096400	6099400	I might not have been born when that happened.
6099400	6101400	And I wasn't born yesterday.
6101400	6104400	But when that happened, we all were.
6104400	6105400	And you know what you did.
6105400	6108400	And it all comes down, Tom,
6108400	6111400	to not whether or not you love me or don't love me.
6111400	6114400	It's whether or not when I look in your eyes,
6114400	6117400	I can feel, I can feel what I used to feel.
6121400	6124400	I walk and I put my hand on a pane of glass
6124400	6127400	and there's raindrops on the other side.
6127400	6130400	And on the other side of that window pane,
6130400	6132400	you can still see Billy Z in the market.
6132400	6133400	That's your fucking...
6133400	6134400	That's a hellscape out there.
6134400	6135400	Oh, yes.
6135400	6137400	It's a fiery hellscape.
6137400	6138400	But then I...
6138400	6140400	Oh, pull my hat.
6141400	6145400	And they thump the wall and a record needle goes down.
6145400	6148400	What would you think?
6149400	6152400	I would do it in this moment.
6153400	6155400	Would you?
6156400	6158400	Well, Nicole,
6158400	6161400	I'm gonna have to get my lawyer involved.
6161400	6163400	Tom, no.
6163400	6165400	Oh, yes, Nicole.
6165400	6166400	Yes.
6166400	6168400	It's past the point now.
6168400	6171400	I've introduced the character, Nicole, my lawyer.
6171400	6173400	Oh.
6179400	6180400	Yeah.
6180400	6181400	Yes.
6181400	6182400	I'm the lawyer.
6182400	6184400	Hi.
6184400	6186400	How are you?
6186400	6187400	Wow.
6187400	6190400	I was in your purse.
6193400	6194400	All right.
6194400	6196400	Well, let's get this over with.
6196400	6197400	Wait a minute.
6197400	6198400	Wait a minute.
6198400	6199400	I'm with Tom, right?
6199400	6200400	Yeah.
6200400	6201400	Yeah, yeah, I'm Tom.
6201400	6203400	Yeah, I was in your purse.
6204400	6206400	And now I'm just poking my nose
6206400	6208400	and my fingers at them.
6208400	6209400	I'm like, I'm the lawyer.
6209400	6210400	I'm the lawyer.
6210400	6212400	This is a powerful visual, Nicole.
6212400	6213400	Hello.
6213400	6214400	Think how it'll play in court.
6214400	6215400	Hello.
6217400	6218400	Fine, I love you.
6218400	6219400	I love you.
6219400	6220400	Let's do it.
6220400	6221400	Good.
6221400	6222400	Nice.
6222400	6223400	Let's stay married.
6223400	6224400	Let's not just stay married.
6224400	6226400	Let's fuck.
6226400	6229400	Let's fuck right here, Nicole.
6229400	6230400	Yes.
6230400	6231400	Yes.
6231400	6232400	Yes.
6232400	6233400	Yes.
6233400	6234400	I'm Tom Cruise.
6234400	6235400	I'm Nicole Kidman.
6237400	6240400	Can we still leave?
6240400	6243400	Now I want you to watch.
6243400	6246400	If it's worth doing to me, it's worth you watching.
6246400	6249400	I'm trying to run a ceramics business here.
6249400	6252400	I don't feel safe with him.
6252400	6254400	Oh, boy.
6254400	6256400	We're done now.
6256400	6259400	Thank you, Tom.
6259400	6260400	So this closure?
6263400	6265400	We're almost done with the show if you left it this way.
6265400	6266400	Oh, really?
6266400	6267400	Oh, no, no, no.
6267400	6268400	Let's stick it out.
6268400	6269400	Yeah.
6270400	6273400	I cut back to the devil's office with Stephanie, was it?
6273400	6274400	What was my name?
6274400	6275400	Stephanie, yeah.
6275400	6276400	Devil.
6277400	6280400	Look, the office has gone to shit since Penn had left.
6280400	6281400	I'm doing everything.
6281400	6283400	I'm at sixes and sevens over here.
6283400	6285400	But I've been looking around.
6285400	6286400	Everybody's having a good time.
6286400	6290400	Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman got back together kind of.
6290400	6292400	Their contra-tomp is kind of over.
6292400	6295400	Margaret Thatcher's having the time of her life.
6295400	6296400	Yeah.
6296400	6297400	So why don't I just put out a...
6297400	6298400	What are we doing here?
6298400	6299400	Exactly.
6299400	6300400	Yeah.
6300400	6301400	Why aren't we just in heaven?
6301400	6303400	You know the bartender down the road?
6303400	6305400	He's making a fortune in ceramics.
6306400	6307400	All right.
6307400	6308400	I'm the one holding up the show.
6308400	6310400	We're barely breaking even here.
6310400	6311400	Stephanie.
6311400	6312400	What?
6312400	6313400	Get me God.
6315400	6316400	It's time.
6319400	6320400	Hello?
6323400	6324400	Hiya.
6337400	6338400	Hi, God.
6338400	6339400	It's Steph.
6339400	6341400	I got the d-bone on the phone for you.
6341400	6342400	Can I put you on?
6342400	6343400	Yeah.
6343400	6344400	Go for it.
6344400	6345400	All right.
6345400	6346400	Devil like a God.
6347400	6348400	Hey.
6350400	6351400	Hey.
6351400	6352400	What's going on?
6353400	6354400	You know.
6355400	6356400	I mean, you know.
6358400	6361400	Yeah, you don't call too much, but it's uncommon.
6361400	6362400	Yeah, yeah.
6362400	6364400	Glad to hear from you.
6364400	6366400	It's good to hear you too.
6368400	6370400	This thing's crazy.
6371400	6374400	It's like, I don't even know what's punishment, what's reward.
6375400	6379400	Yeah, when you're outside of my glory, things get all mixed up.
6382400	6384400	But you know all about that.
6384400	6387400	But it's got to be crazy up there too, man.
6387400	6389400	No, I mean, it's heaven.
6392400	6394400	Paradise, my friend.
6395400	6399400	So, yeah, I just, I miss you.
6399400	6400400	I miss you.
6400400	6401400	I miss you.
6402400	6403400	Yeah.
6404400	6405400	No, I know.
6405400	6406400	I know.
6407400	6408400	Yeah.
6409400	6410400	No, I know.
6410400	6411400	I know.
6414400	6417400	All right, well, we should get together sometime.
6418400	6421400	Yeah, no, I'm planning on that a couple thousand years.
6421400	6423400	Yo, don't flatter yourself, you fucking faggot.
6424400	6426400	Oh, no, devil, devil.
6427400	6428400	Call him back.
6428400	6429400	Call him back.
6429400	6430400	No.
6430400	6431400	I'm calling him back.
6431400	6432400	No, no.
6432400	6434400	No, I will turn you into a fucking mouse.
6435400	6437400	Our lawyers agree that you're not allowed to...
6437400	6438400	You're a mouse!
6439400	6440400	Squeak, squeak.
6441400	6443400	Everyone that defies me is a fucking mouse.
6444400	6446400	I don't know what he fucking...
6446400	6447400	Why does he do that?
6447400	6449400	It's so fucked up to say to somebody.
6450400	6452400	Oh, my God, it's so fucked up.
6455400	6457400	Jumping out the devil window.
6458400	6459400	Shh.
6461400	6463400	Vanilla sky.
6475400	6476400	Boop.
6477400	6478400	Boop.
6479400	6480400	Boop.
6481400	6482400	Boop.
6483400	6484400	Boop.
6484400	6485400	He just blinks.
6485400	6486400	Honey, he just blinks.
6487400	6488400	Honey, he just blinks.
6489400	6490400	Honey, are you okay?
6490400	6491400	Are you with us, honey?
6492400	6495400	It's your mother and father, Mrs. Mr. and Mrs. Devil.
6498400	6499400	Dad.
6499400	6503400	You have such a bad fall, big guy.
6505400	6506400	The mom.
6507400	6508400	Dad?
6508400	6509400	Yeah.
6510400	6511400	I got kicked out of heaven.
6511400	6512400	Yeah.
6512400	6513400	No, no.
6514400	6515400	You did it a second time.
6516400	6519400	It's self-destructive.
6522400	6525400	You want to be unhappy, son.
6525400	6527400	It's like you want to be unhappy.
6528400	6530400	That doesn't help.
6531400	6536400	I'm just saying, you keep getting fired from your own jobs.
6537400	6539400	You're in charge of hell.
6540400	6543400	Now it's being run by this weird ceramics corporation.
6544400	6545400	Shit's going.
6545400	6546400	It's really horrifying.
6550400	6557400	And the devil's dick moves upward like Pinocchio's nose
6558400	6562400	through the ceiling of the hospital into the sky
6563400	6567400	where it blooms into a red tree with green leaves.
6568400	6572400	And within those green leaves, caterpillars feed.
6576400	6577400	Oh, get it?
6577400	6578400	It says the little caterpillar.
6578400	6580400	Hello, it's Margaret Thatcher again.
6580400	6582400	Where's the toilet, actually?
6585400	6586400	It's over there.
6586400	6587400	It's over there?
6587400	6588400	Yeah, yeah.
6588400	6589400	Back there?
6589400	6590400	Yeah.
6590400	6591400	It would have...
6591400	6592400	I'll be back.
6593400	6594400	This is the actual...
6594400	6595400	Yeah.
6598400	6599400	Really had to pee in real life.
6599400	6600400	That was a real life pee.
6600400	6601400	Oh, he had to go back.
6601400	6602400	Oh, he had to really go.
6602400	6604400	I think he really had to pee.
6604400	6607400	We've been up here a long time.
6607400	6609400	Oh, I just realized...
6609400	6612400	He was gesturing and he was pointing and I was like...
6614400	6617400	I thought he meant like, should I leave?
6617400	6619400	And I was like, no, baby, stay.
6621400	6624400	Like I was doing him a big favor like, no, come on.
6624400	6625400	We're all people here.
6625400	6627400	And he's pissing my pants.
6627400	6629400	You know what he's doing right now?
6629400	6631400	It's making chocolate pooping.
6633400	6634400	Yeah, it's great.
6634400	6635400	All right.
6635400	6637400	Where was it going with the caterpillars?
6637400	6638400	I don't know.
6638400	6641400	Do we need to talk about the loud laughing guy again?
6641400	6643400	Because we've talked about everything else.
6643400	6644400	You know the guy.
6644400	6645400	Where's the guy?
6645400	6646400	He's right there.
6646400	6647400	There he is.
6647400	6648400	Let him have a good time.
6648400	6649400	He's having a great time.
6649400	6650400	All right.
6650400	6651400	Let him have a good time.
6651400	6652400	He's fine in here.
6652400	6653400	People are still...
6653400	6654400	You got a loud laugh.
6654400	6657400	I guess they're going like, that guy's laugh is amazing.
6665400	6666400	I don't know what to do.
6666400	6668400	I want to have a button to just push
6668400	6670400	where that happens at all times.
6670400	6671400	You do.
6671400	6674400	It's called the show and talking, right?
6674400	6676400	I mean, he likes it all.
6677400	6679400	He likes it all.
6685400	6687400	Recycle.
6690400	6692400	I don't know what to do.
6692400	6695400	Can't make a law against somebody's laugh.
6695400	6698400	But I think it's the way it hits the microphones.
6698400	6699400	It's the redditors.
6699400	6700400	You know, they're joyless.
6700400	6702400	They don't hear a lot of laughter.
6703400	6706400	So they're like, oh my God, that's already grating
6706400	6709400	just the sound of joy in general.
6709400	6711400	And then that guy is like,
6711400	6714400	holy shit, bulldozer of joy.
6715400	6717400	I have a thing going on here.
6717400	6719400	And on the other side of the spectrum,
6719400	6722400	one guy just sublimates all of his joy to you.
6726400	6729400	I think we've learned a lesson tonight.
6729400	6731400	Oh, we learned a lot.
6731400	6733400	I'd probably sum it up in something
6733400	6735400	that you can applaud to.
6742400	6743400	Yeah.
6743400	6744400	Yeah.
6744400	6745400	Yeah.
6745400	6746400	Yeah.
6746400	6747400	Yeah.
6747400	6748400	Yeah.
6748400	6749400	Yeah.
6749400	6750400	Yeah.
6750400	6751400	Just let me feel.
6751400	6752400	Wait, Dan?
6752400	6754400	Can I change my mind on that selection?
6754400	6755400	Yeah, sure.
6755400	6756400	Yeah, sure.
6756400	6757400	Feel good.
6759400	6760400	Oh, shit.
6760400	6762400	Margaret Thatcher's back.
6762400	6764400	Oh, yeah.
6764400	6765400	Okay.
6765400	6766400	Oh, yeah.
6766400	6768400	Margaret Thatcher, can you hype man for him,
6768400	6770400	like Flavor Flav's down?
6770400	6772400	I like, I love the other one, though.
6772400	6773400	This one's intimidating me.
6773400	6775400	It reminds me of the movie.
6777400	6778400	Yeah.
6783400	6784400	Yeah.
6784400	6785400	Yeah.
6785400	6786400	Yeah.
6786400	6789400	Are you crazy for this one, Dan?
6790400	6791400	Yeah.
6791400	6793400	Gleevey, you hear that?
6795400	6796400	Yeah.
6796400	6797400	Yeah.
6797400	6798400	East Coast.
6801400	6802400	Just stick around.
6802400	6803400	He's just getting started.
6803400	6804400	He's just getting started.
6804400	6805400	East Coast.
6810400	6813400	East Coast is the only coast.
6813400	6815400	It's an unpopular opinion,
6815400	6817400	but only on the West Coast.
6817400	6820400	The West Coast doesn't exist.
6820400	6823400	It's an artificial construct
6823400	6826400	written by a list of people.
6826400	6828400	Call them Jews.
6831400	6835400	I'm an East Coast anti-Semitic rapper.
6835400	6838400	East Coast anti-Semitic rapper.
6838400	6841400	I believe the West Coast is a figment
6841400	6843400	created by the Zionists.
6845400	6849400	An extreme East Coast anti-Semitic rapper.
6849400	6852400	Don't get any more East Coast than this.
6855400	6858400	It's just a concept I'm workshopping.
6861400	6863400	I can't even hear the...
6863400	6864400	What's the beat?
6864400	6865400	It just sounds like...
6865400	6866400	Yo.
6866400	6867400	You picked this one.
6867400	6868400	Yo.
6868400	6869400	Yo.
6869400	6870400	Yo.
6870400	6871400	Spaghetti.
6871400	6872400	Linguine.
6872400	6873400	Pasta.
6873400	6874400	Sauce.
6874400	6875400	I fucked your mama.
6876400	6877400	Who's the boss?
6877400	6878400	Give me a second.
6878400	6879400	Don't.
6879400	6880400	Don't help.
6882400	6883400	I mean, that's extreme, right?
6883400	6884400	It's extreme.
6884400	6885400	That's not fine.
6885400	6886400	That's fine.
6886400	6887400	Don't feel shame.
6887400	6888400	Don't.
6889400	6890400	But feel a little...
6890400	6891400	It's a 10% shame.
6891400	6894400	Just feel 10% shame, I think, then everyone will...
6894400	6895400	Alright.
6895400	6897400	We'll stop losing subscribers.
6897400	6898400	Alright.
6899400	6900400	Yo.
6900400	6901400	Chopped down.
6901400	6903400	Bottom up.
6903400	6904400	Fucked your mama so hard.
6904400	6906400	She looked like a cup.
6907400	6910400	The diameter of a vagina
6910400	6914400	was as big as North Carolina.
6914400	6917400	Put my dick in it so hard.
6917400	6920400	Fucked your mama into the front and back yard.
6920400	6921400	But...
6921400	6922400	That song was over.
6922400	6923400	Okay.
6923400	6924400	You wanted it again?
6924400	6925400	No.
6925400	6926400	We're doing it again.
6926400	6927400	So close to an ending with this.
6927400	6928400	We're ending with this.
6928400	6929400	Alright.
6929400	6930400	Yeah.
6930400	6931400	We can end at any moment.
6931400	6932400	Any moment this is over.
6934400	6935400	Oh, shit.
6938400	6939400	Nancy Reagan dance.
6939400	6941400	The Nancy Reagan dance, everybody.
6942400	6943400	Doing the Reagan.
6944400	6945400	He's doing the Nancy.
6946400	6947400	Oh, yes.
6947400	6948400	Hey, no.
6949400	6950400	Yo.
6950400	6951400	Yo.
6951400	6952400	Yo.
6952400	6953400	Yo.
6953400	6954400	Yo.
6954400	6955400	Everybody do the Nancy.
6955400	6956400	Mustache.
6956400	6957400	Salt.
6957400	6958400	Ketchup.
6958400	6959400	Lettuce.
