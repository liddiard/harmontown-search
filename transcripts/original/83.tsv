0	10000	Save it! Save it. No, don't save it. Let your freak flags fly, you guys.
10480	14400	Whoa!
19760	26120	I love those J, I, and G, M, E, bells.
26960	32560	That's my favorite Christmas carol growing up Frank Sinatra. This vinyl record for me.
32760	37480	This song has the very very meaning of Christmas.
37720	42360	I mean, we've all heard Jingle Bells, but dig this shit.
42560	46720	Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
46920	50280	Welcome one and all to a very special Hermit Town.
50480	56000	For the very last time in the year of our Lord, 2013, Hermit Town is now in session.
61000	64280	Won't you welcome to the stage the reason for the season,
64440	68200	the mayor of Hermit Town, Mr. Dan Harmon.
75800	79400	Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah, Happy New Year.
81040	83480	It's a holiday special, Jeff.
83680	87160	It's a cavalcade of holiday celebration.
87360	92160	We're going to have countdowns and years in review.
92160	94840	A ballad sung by children.
95040	98800	At one point, the entire room is slightly flooded than frozen,
99000	101160	and we all skate out to the parking lot.
101360	108200	Special Christmas wishes, dances, a little Christmas rap.
108400	112000	And then a very heartwarming poem that you improvise at the very end.
112200	113600	Yep.
113800	115840	And gifts, gifts for everybody.
116040	117600	Everybody.
119760	122080	We'll figure it out.
122920	125520	This would be a good time for a beefsteak bill to step into action
125720	128080	and bring him back full of goodies. Yeah, yeah.
128280	132560	OK, well, I think it must be said that...
132760	135000	Oh, God damn it. I've forgotten your name.
135200	138360	Anatoly. Anatoly is dressed up like some sort of weird
138560	141440	cross between Saint Nick and Krampus.
141640	143480	He's going to...
145920	147040	Anatoly, get on stage.
147240	149920	Everybody Instagram the shit out of this right now.
150120	151520	I mean...
153160	157400	What in the gay porn is going on up here?
157600	161040	Anatoly, wearing a kind of a...
161240	162600	Correct.
162800	167000	As Adam Goldberg properly says, he is Anatoly correct.
167200	173840	He's wearing a red Santa tuk and little short shorts, red and some ugg boots.
174040	179600	And he's really ready for Santa Monica Boulevard at any moment.
179920	183840	Anatoly, is this your way of saying that it's colder in Russia?
184040	189640	Like, are you being kind of like homesick and going like, fuck you, weather pussies?
189840	191760	Yeah, fuck you almost definitely.
191960	193360	Yeah.
194200	198240	You seem to be engaged in your
198440	202560	Soviet given right to intoxication as usual.
202760	206800	I'm talking about some kind of red here.
207800	210320	Merry Christmas, Anatoly.
210520	213240	I don't celebrate Christmas in Russia, so I won't accept it.
213440	214560	Oh, OK.
214760	219760	Do you're committing to the whole atheist thing in Russia still?
219960	223360	Not really. I mean, we have just different kind of Christmas.
223560	224160	Yeah.
224360	227880	No, there was one like no one cares about which like...
228080	229440	Who cares about Christmas? No one.
229640	231120	What is it? What's the Russian Christmas?
231160	234720	I just celebrate Christmas on like old,
234920	241680	wrong calendar, so it's like we celebrate Christmas on January 7th
241880	244120	and it's like mostly religious holiday.
244320	247200	So most people don't care about it.
247400	250240	They just drink and eat.
250440	253400	Is it winter solstice thing?
253400	254880	It's honoring the end of the year.
255080	259520	No, no, we have a new year for this.
259520	261480	New year in Russia has got to be pretty intense.
261680	266360	Yeah, New Year is basically a knockoff from European Christmas.
266560	268280	How it's like
268480	274280	origins of Russian New Year, they like stole Christmas from Europe and changed
274480	278800	Santa Claus to the great guy who is way better than Santa Claus.
279000	279920	What's his name?
280120	282240	His name is in Russian,
283200	284880	which means death morose.
285080	287080	Oh, that's great.
287280	289840	I mean, that can't be right.
290040	295960	And it's like in Soviet Russia, a year ends you.
298560	301040	I don't remember Soviet part of Russia.
301240	301760	I know. I know.
301760	303800	You're not. You're post-Yakov Smirnoff generation.
303800	305880	You don't know. You don't even know what that is.
305880	307360	I barely know what that is.
307560	309920	Anatoly, what part of the Russian holiday
309960	313440	tradition brought to mind coming to harm in town?
313640	315200	Nearly naked.
318400	324040	I mean, it's like after you're like drugs, you have to be naked.
325760	327440	After drugs, you have to be naked.
327640	332040	So are you on like ecstasy right now or mushrooms or what's going on?
332240	335040	I might or might not be.
335240	337520	So that's ecstasy.
337680	341120	Yes, that sounds like a resulting DAW.
343040	344480	So are you giving a lot of back rubs,
344680	347280	grinding your teeth and promising to call people more often?
347480	348920	That's
349320	355080	that's that or his ecstasy changed since I was 25.
355280	357120	It's like last time you took.
357320	363000	No, no, I think I took what did I took some MDMA in where was I?
363200	365920	I can't remember because you took MDMA.
366120	367320	I don't know.
367520	368240	Perfect sense.
368440	371520	But it's been years since I did anything interesting.
371720	373440	So you're kind of lame now.
373640	374400	I'm kind of lame.
374600	377280	Yeah. Are you afraid to do hallucinogenic drugs again?
377480	378520	Yeah. Yeah.
378720	380600	What's the fear?
380800	384560	Sometime around your your first mortgage payment, you take on the sometimes way
384560	388920	before your first mortgage payment, you kind of I started having bad experiences
389120	394720	on even too much marijuana like I have to be very careful even smoking pot or I'll
394720	398720	get very at my freak out threshold is very low.
398920	400880	I'll start like panicking.
401080	403000	I guess that's what they mean by paranoia.
403200	405280	I never I never realized it until I realized it.
405480	409120	Yeah. I'm kind of like paranoid about like, oh, why am I getting high?
409120	410440	I'm too old to be getting high.
410640	415880	And all the weird shit happens to me because I'm outside of God's
416800	421680	step like I'm out of rhythm and out of the moment and making money and being
421680	426120	grown up and and that's been going on since I was like your concern, Dan, at your
426120	428600	age right now that if you did hallucinogens, you might come to Harman
428800	431640	town wearing red short shorts.
431840	434400	I would love to think that I had it in me.
434600	437520	It bears mentioning that totally that I've always thought of you as kind of a
437520	440360	shy fellow, like I mean, even though you sit in the front row and you are willing
440560	444920	to get up on stage, you seem kind of reserved to yourself.
445120	446480	This is a very different side of you.
446680	450360	I just don't like to talk and don't have a mic in my hand.
450480	451800	Oh,
452560	453560	look,
455520	458680	I'll have what you're having, man.
458880	460200	Who is your dealer?
460400	461880	Jesus.
462080	467400	I mean, would it be strange if I will say that I'm like 100 drug free?
467600	471040	Oh, what? 100 drug free.
471240	476160	Like, I mean, it's supposed to be 100 percent percent.
476360	478480	Right. You're not 100 percent drug free.
478480	482480	So, yeah, but I kind of am kind of.
482680	485520	What do you mean? You kind of can't be kind of 100 percent.
485720	489000	You're you're you're something to the gills.
489200	493320	You're like clearly like, oh, are you high on life that you have?
493520	498280	Is it like super stupid expression, like being high on life?
498480	502080	Well, sure, it's it's stupid.
502280	507240	I'm saying I mean, like maybe you're just really in a good mood and that mood.
507720	510000	I was definitely in a pretty good mood.
510200	515320	You have almost identical shoulder and back hair patterns to me.
515520	516880	However, I am.
517080	521440	I am, as Darth Vader said to Luke, it is too late for me.
523640	524480	Take your shirt off.
524680	526760	I think I think we owe it to the live audience.
526960	528880	It's pretty it's it's uncomfortable.
529080	530960	You notice that you notice that three people clap.
531160	532440	Not that I
532640	535480	not that it's my fantasy that everyone but
536200	540680	even the freak show element of it, people are like, nah,
540880	542760	I don't want to I don't want to see it.
542960	543720	This is enough.
543920	547920	All right. Well, and totally, I'll give you two choices.
548120	552200	You can you can take a seat now, enjoy the rest of the show, or you can stay up here
552400	557640	as naked Russian Santa Claus, death morose is his name.
557840	560720	I do want to know what does it mean?
560920	563400	But yes, I think like.
563560	565880	Grandpa Frost, Grandpa Frost.
566080	568440	Yeah. All right.
568640	570600	Does Grandpa Frost grant wishes?
570600	573240	Does he does he help people achieve what they want in the new year?
573440	574000	Yeah, pretty much.
574200	579360	You do everything like the same as Santa Claus, except he isn't he's not fat.
579560	581080	Right.
581280	583680	Because she's not American.
584960	586520	Wow.
586720	589800	The Cold War just got colder.
590640	591560	That was the last.
591760	593520	The Frost War.
593720	598600	Well, the shot heard round the kitchenette.
598800	605400	I mean, Santa Claus isn't technically American, so that doesn't make any sense.
605600	608600	Right. I mean, we kind of we kind of we kind of Americanized him.
608800	611160	Also, I think we took ownership of that.
611360	614240	He wore green until Coca Cola co-opted that.
614440	615840	Is that true or is that an urban legend?
615840	616800	I believe that's true.
617000	618760	Coca Cola is the reason why he's been
618760	620960	branded as a guy that was red and white.
621160	621960	Makes sense to me.
622160	623640	I don't know. I don't care.
623840	630160	I like I like I think people are too sardonic about Christmas because the truth
630360	635160	is that it's, you know, whatever you're celebrating at this time of year,
635360	638080	it what you're really celebrating is the solstice.
638080	642000	You're really celebrating the fact that the days are about to get the shortest
642200	645920	that they'll ever get before slowly starting to become longer again.
646080	652000	And and and, you know, old cavemen and young cavemen.
652200	654520	I believe I think that they, you know,
654720	658280	like they were conscious of how long the days were and how long the nights were.
658480	663320	And I think that this time of year as a global condition of mankind,
663520	668160	like everyone all over the place at this time of year, if you have a winter and you
668360	673480	have this sort of solstice where you it's sort of ingrained in us culturally
673560	679200	to celebrate the death of the year and and and ask ourselves what that means.
679200	681160	And then you cycle is beginning and stuff.
681360	685320	And it doesn't really matter that, like, I mean, you know, you got your people who
685520	689960	stamp their little feet about how Christianity co-opted this time of year.
689960	694240	You got your people that stamped their feet about the war on Christmas and trying
694440	695760	to politically correctify everything.
695960	700760	And I it's all kind of I think those people just like choosing this time of year
700760	703600	to be unhappy. And I think that you get to spend this
703600	705000	time of year doing whatever you want.
705000	706240	It's a little fantasy time.
706280	707720	Dan, do you do you love Christmas?
707920	712600	I do. I really like it's a it's a because it's something that you mark.
712800	716360	It's a time plotting my bravery.
716560	720040	It's it's a bold stance every year.
720240	722200	It's a very bold stance.
722400	724440	It's it's it's probably not fashionable.
724440	726040	And I don't I don't like the only thing
726040	728880	that I like about it is just the fact that it is that it happens once a year.
728880	731160	That's it. That doesn't really I like that.
731360	733480	But but but Valentine's Day happens once a year.
733480	734920	And you don't give a fuck about that probably.
734960	737520	Yeah, you're right. It's got it's got a little treat.
737720	739120	It's got little trademarks to it.
739320	741880	It's it's got it's like the Christmas lights go up at the bar.
742080	744960	I think that's the thing that I really like is like
745160	749920	like like like like these dive bars that they put up Christmas lights or not from
749920	753960	here or if you are and if you haven't been go to the roost in that water village.
754160	756840	And it's a little dumpy dive bar like the drawing room.
756840	760440	But around Christmas time, they put up really good Christmas lights
760640	763720	and they make eggnog that will wipe you out.
763920	767960	It's like three kinds of booze and go to the roost tonight or soon before,
768160	769720	before, before New Year's.
769920	773120	And it's that's a good Christmas thing and a very good jukebox as well.
773320	774440	All right. Russian Santa Claus.
774440	776560	I want you to we're going to give you an elf now.
776760	778760	We're going to provide you with Russian elf.
778960	783200	OK, but Russian Santa Claus doesn't have elves.
784400	785880	I mean, I can have one.
785920	790840	Yeah, that's in the spirit of perestroika, please.
791040	792360	Let's meet each other halfway.
792560	794840	Yes, this is a Christmas miracle that's happening right now.
795040	801040	That way we have a semi-naked Russian Santa Claus or death morose up here.
801240	805760	All right. Let's bring out Duncan Trussell, our friend.
805760	810560	It's the right to sing this land song tonight.
814560	816920	This is Anatoly's.
818120	820400	Is it Mike under you?
824200	828760	So it's a it's a beard fest, beard fest.
828960	830320	OK.
831640	834160	How was it funny? I love it.
834320	836920	I just say it's beautiful.
837600	838920	So thank you for coming, Duncan.
838920	841880	My car was parked outside your house because I got drunk a couple of nights ago
842080	844440	and you were in your house, so I brought you here tonight.
844640	847560	Yeah, thank you for coming.
847760	852080	You ripped me away from an Xbox one that I just bought.
852280	854080	Yeah, that's friendship.
854280	858800	That's friendship. Don't boo him for coming to the show.
859000	860200	Fuck.
861200	863120	Is it bad to buy an Xbox one?
863280	864760	No, no.
864960	867840	Are they are they good?
868040	869440	I don't know. I don't know.
869640	871120	I just know it's great.
871320	872320	But aren't you scared?
872520	876400	You're getting monitored the whole time by the Kinect controller.
876600	879400	But how is that?
879600	883800	I don't want to have to unplug a camera that's watching me all the time.
884000	885320	Don't you like to move there?
885520	887880	I don't know.
889080	890720	I don't know.
891720	894280	What did Anatoly say?
894480	895600	I don't know.
895800	896800	I don't know what he said.
897000	898680	He said, don't you like to be looked at?
898880	901640	Oh, this is Russian.
903240	905600	It's comforting for them.
905800	909400	It makes them feel like they're alive to be monitored.
910160	914040	Duncan, do you have any special Christmas memories?
914240	918360	Christmas memories, for better or for worse?
918560	919560	Oh, man.
919600	921560	Can you think about one while I complain about something?
921760	923080	Yes.
924440	928920	OK, it's more of a rhetorical question than a complaint.
930040	935400	If you're writing, if you're a TV critic
935600	938920	and I think all TV critics are great,
939120	943760	wonderful, misunderstood people who should all be appreciated more,
943960	949040	as long as they're writing network television reviews of network sitcoms,
949040	951160	those people are great.
951360	953840	The but I have a question for the TV
954040	958400	critics who do reviews of SNL episodes,
958600	963560	which I didn't remember where they where they where they review each sketch
963760	966920	and talk about what whether or not it was funny.
967120	974200	Yeah. Am I supposed to read that before I watched the comedy sketch or after?
974400	976160	And in either case, dumb.
976160	979920	Like what what kind of life are we supposed to be living?
980120	984560	I got like that comedy sketch, Mr. Farts, huh?
984760	987120	That's funny. Farted.
987320	991640	Huh. I wonder what Joe Johnson had to say.
991840	994720	He he didn't think the Farts were funny.
994920	996040	I don't know what is this.
996240	998160	It's a little insane, isn't it?
998360	1000360	And here's the even weirder thing.
1000560	1002600	I wonder what Joe Johnson recommends.
1002800	1006000	Huh. Looks like they did a Farts sketch on SNL.
1006200	1008760	I think I'll read about it.
1008960	1012560	Well, it seems like the Farts came fast and plenty.
1012760	1016400	Overall, it was no cone heads, but a good time was had.
1016600	1018480	I'm going to give that sketch a look.
1018680	1019920	See,
1020920	1022440	huh,
1022640	1025560	Joe Johnson was right again.
1026360	1033520	I consumed a sketch using the navigation system of a professional sketch reviewer.
1033720	1038160	How do you take three minutes to watch the fucking sketch and somebody's got a five
1038360	1041840	paragraph theme about how did you come across this SNL reviewer?
1042040	1042720	I just I don't know.
1042920	1043720	I saw a thing.
1043920	1049360	I clicked the link and I just I was like, what is that really a thing?
1049560	1050920	But you know what I feel about that?
1050920	1051880	The SNL reviewer.
1051880	1055280	I feel the exact same way that I feel about the guy who has to watch people
1055480	1057440	playing Xbox at the NSA.
1057640	1059600	It's like you're getting
1060600	1062200	it's like instant karma.
1062360	1063800	You're getting what you deserve.
1064000	1067080	You have to watch SNL sketches professionally.
1067280	1073920	You have to watch like mildly overweight guys laying on their couch,
1074120	1078320	vanishing into oblivion and then have a report on somebody's desk at 10 a.m.
1078520	1082200	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, people are still.
1082400	1085040	Steve Mitchell picked his nose and ate it.
1085240	1086880	Yeah, exactly.
1087080	1087800	That's what happened.
1088000	1089640	I'm not hip to this.
1089640	1091880	So they watch you play Xbox in the event
1092080	1095840	that what that you're good at doing like they had the monkey bars like a.
1096040	1097400	It's just it's just biometrics.
1097400	1098440	You're being monitored now.
1098640	1100880	They have cameras and these things are really cool.
1101080	1105200	I went to Comic Con and they showed Justin and I the Xbox one
1105400	1109080	when we did an Xbox interview for their little channel.
1109280	1112080	And they took us behind a curtain and fired one of these things up.
1112280	1114440	And it was looking at my skeleton.
1114640	1118520	I mean, not even not my skeleton, but it was it put a skeleton over my body
1118760	1122720	because it could recognize my body and know where each of my knuckles were.
1122920	1127480	And my and also Justin standing next to me and we were like dancing around and it
1127680	1131640	knew and then I started I was laughing the whole time because it was amazing.
1131640	1133240	And then I started noticing that when I
1133440	1136080	smiled, it said that I was happy next to my head.
1136280	1144240	Yeah. And so the the the the Nielsen evolution of this system is kind of obvious.
1144440	1145320	It's so awesome.
1145320	1146800	You now no longer need people to crank
1146800	1153160	a dial in order to test a TV show, ostensibly our entertainment will be in
1153360	1158240	the hands of people who are are are so weird that they actually smile when they
1158240	1162080	enjoy themselves in the privacy of their living room while watching a National
1162280	1164000	Geographic show.
1164200	1166280	But to the extent that that doesn't happen,
1166480	1169200	everything on National Geographic will get canceled.
1169400	1174200	But you can stream, you know, like there's something called Twitch where you can stream
1174200	1177920	playing a game, like you could stream playing a game and also I guess it films
1178120	1179400	you playing, too.
1179600	1185040	So like there's already been bad accidents where someone left that on and that filmed
1185240	1189440	him and his wife was passed out and it like filmed him rubbing her pussy.
1189640	1193040	Oh, yeah. Oh, really?
1193240	1195040	Oh, I see. It was on purpose.
1195240	1196520	Yeah, I didn't know that.
1196720	1199120	I thought he didn't know he's being monitored.
1199320	1202720	Rubbing bus, pussy, but.
1204240	1208120	Russian Santa Claus, what are you doing here?
1208320	1209400	Were you?
1209600	1212000	Did someone mention the Russian Santa Claus
1212200	1215840	equivalent of a plate of milk and cookies?
1217840	1221600	I believe in Russia, they leave out a
1221800	1226360	bother of top rubbing, puss.
1227760	1229480	Wait, so wait, wait.
1229680	1234160	So a guy rubbed his wife's pussy on camera to make it like as though he was
1234360	1235680	doing something bad.
1235880	1236960	A lot of people watching doing it.
1237160	1238760	Well, as I said, you remember chat roulette.
1238960	1241960	I mean, it's like chat roulette very quickly became
1242160	1245600	everyone's got their dick out because there's like, yeah, that's right.
1245800	1247800	That's like those people are the opposite of me.
1248000	1251160	Like the idea that you want to like the people who want to
1251360	1252600	not nothing, nothing against them.
1252800	1254720	And I'm whatever, whatever floats your boat.
1254920	1258480	Well, I mean, unless you're victimizing people, but which these people sometimes
1258680	1263240	often do because they need to be like scene jerking off and all this stuff.
1264080	1265520	That's like so the opposite of me.
1265720	1267000	Like I'm so
1267200	1268640	sexist, too intimate for me.
1268840	1273520	I just really boy, I wish I could just hide from my partner.
1273720	1274680	Yeah, I know what you mean.
1274880	1279400	Yeah, Doug Stanhope has a really funny joke about how, like, you know, when you
1279600	1284800	watch porn, for those of you who watch porn, like there's the porn where the camera
1285000	1289280	guy will start talking and it always sucks because he's like, oh, yeah, you're so hot.
1289280	1291600	And it's like you just don't want to hear the sleazy guy talking.
1291600	1293240	You just want there to be this kind of
1293440	1296680	sacred silence when this thing is happening.
1296880	1301520	But you were talking about Instagram now has become this thing you're starting to go
1301720	1303760	down. Well, Instagram is like a yet.
1303960	1308080	Instagram is a kind of like you can chat on Instagram now.
1308280	1310800	They just added that they open the floodgates.
1311000	1312680	Yeah, it's really it's a day.
1312880	1317480	It's a this is Dustin Dustin's fault for showing me this.
1317480	1320600	I was fine. And then he like tied my mating
1320800	1325840	impulses in with Instagram and I can't stop staring at the fucking rectangle.
1325840	1327320	So take me through how that works.
1327320	1330760	Like you're on Instagram and you see, do you see a girl's picture?
1330960	1335200	She took a selfie, as you kids call it, and and you like the way she looks.
1335200	1337640	And now you can send her a message, which you couldn't do before, right?
1337840	1341920	Yeah. So what happens is now what happens is very attractive people,
1342120	1346840	very attractive girls, they have this instant way to melt dopamine out of their
1346880	1351200	brains, which is they just take a picture of themselves and put it on Instagram.
1351400	1354440	And then thousands of people like the picture.
1354640	1359600	And that keeps that makes them feel like they are connected to the universe and
1359600	1361200	that they're alive or something.
1361200	1362760	But that was how Instagram always has been.
1362760	1363800	You could you post a photo.
1363800	1365320	People like it. What's what's the new thing?
1365520	1367000	Now you can contact people.
1367200	1370760	Yeah. Now you can send people like you can say hello to people and stuff and then
1370760	1375400	they can write you back and then that pulls you into like a darker vortex of
1375560	1377960	community and you can send a private photo.
1378160	1378960	Obviously, you can.
1379160	1382680	Yeah, since Dustin taught me this thing about Instagram,
1382880	1385680	I felt like I was going to be murdered four times.
1385880	1389000	Like I felt like honestly in danger and catfish.
1389200	1392240	You said it's combining Instagram with your mating impulses.
1392240	1394040	What are you what are your mating impulses?
1394240	1395400	Well, no, it's a mating ritual.
1395400	1398400	You know, like people go to a bar and they want to meet people like everyone's
1398400	1401960	trying to make people are generally trying to reproduce or they're they're in
1401960	1405880	a monogamous relationship, but people are generally driven by their sex drives.
1406080	1409760	And it used to be you would go into the world to try to do that.
1409960	1411920	And now this has been digitized.
1412120	1415400	And so there's this whole new thing forming, which is like, you know,
1415600	1419200	like the way it works is like I don't what was your name?
1419400	1422080	It's Anatoly Anatoly Anatoly.
1422280	1427240	Like if I wanted to sleep with you, I would say thank you.
1427440	1430720	I would look at if you were awesome.
1430720	1432160	I thought he said I do.
1432360	1435000	Oh, he said, did you say I do it?
1435200	1436320	I said I'm OK with it.
1436520	1439040	I love him.
1439240	1444160	It's got most wonderful time of the year.
1444360	1446960	But in Russian.
1448720	1450360	But you know, it's a series of likes.
1450360	1453680	So you like someone's picture and then they like your picture and then you like
1453680	1456480	their picture and now you're doing the thing where you that's the digital version
1456480	1460080	of looking at someone and looking away and then you catch them looking at you.
1460520	1465880	Now they got you got the Cupid's and the the what's all the dating stuff.
1466080	1469720	There's a Christian Mingle Swiper Swiper.
1469920	1470800	Tender.
1471000	1475320	Well, I was I was doing a I was doing a comedy show in the Midwest.
1475360	1479760	And but now I've but since then I've seen this commercial here in Los Angeles.
1479960	1485960	It's like farmer dates like it's a what's it called farmer date?
1486160	1489240	What state farmer state farmer farmer?
1489240	1494560	No, it's not a state farmer, state farmer farmer, not stink farmer.
1494760	1496040	It's a farmer's dating thing.
1496240	1498560	What's the is anyone know the name of it?
1498760	1499960	Huh? Data farmer.
1500160	1504240	And it goes like find a farmer and you're a farmer.
1504240	1505960	You want to date a farmer and find farmers.
1506000	1508720	And at the end, it goes to farmer city food.
1508920	1510920	Just do get it.
1515160	1516320	It's Christian Mingle.
1516320	1519600	But for people that grow soybeans
1520600	1523040	and that aren't Christian, apparently,
1523240	1527640	that they have to go to the greatest tag new commercial of all time.
1527840	1529640	It's really just do it.
1529840	1534520	Well, the Internet really is ubiquitous now that if there's pockets of it for
1534720	1537560	non-city folk, that's pretty amazing.
1537760	1542960	Well, it's a welcome to hillbilly.gov.
1543160	1547000	We don't count the technology around this domain.
1547200	1549840	Welcome to homeless hookup.
1551760	1552600	Great idea.
1552800	1555800	Employed people just don't get it.
1556920	1557840	We really did it.
1558040	1562240	We we also don't know how to monetize this.
1565440	1569680	I don't think the money is coming in from the from the from the homeless people.
1569880	1572840	There's people there might be people who want to date a farmer or a homeless
1572920	1575960	person, like, do you have to be another farmer or can you be like a sexy lady
1576160	1578120	that like likes overalls?
1578320	1580400	I would say I'm pretty sure there's a certain
1580600	1584920	percentage of traffic on Christian Mingle or jade date that aren't Christian or Jewish.
1584920	1586640	I would say there's lots of people that are sure.
1586640	1591640	Phoning in and saying, like, yeah, I love the Lord as much as the next guy.
1591840	1595640	I heard that Christian Mingle has the highest assault rate for a dating site.
1595840	1598200	Is that true? I don't know.
1599200	1603080	It's the most wonderful time.
1603280	1605840	That's the kind of thing that would immediately have traction.
1606040	1609480	Like you just created a you just created that like idea.
1609480	1611760	That's going to be what makes sense, doesn't it?
1611760	1613160	Because like, if you're a fundamentalist
1613360	1619760	Christian, you believe in a death God, you believe in a it's a it's a God that's
1619960	1624040	eventually going to destroy the planet, sacrifice this child and you worship that
1624040	1627760	being you pray to that being so it wouldn't it does make sense that you
1627840	1629240	do it. It's a sacrifice, God.
1629440	1631640	So some percentage of the people who go
1631840	1635680	on Christian Mingle probably still believe the old ways and think
1635880	1641040	where you sacrifice your date. Yeah, we're because God in the Old Testament
1641240	1644240	is always telling people like you must kill your son today.
1644440	1645640	Right. Yeah.
1645840	1649680	So how does like I'm sure people on Christian Mingle the same thing happens
1649680	1651080	where the transmission comes down.
1651080	1654160	Like if you believe in me, you will decapitate probably some casual
1654160	1656600	Christians, I think, that use the Internet to date.
1656800	1662240	Like, sure, it is like, you know, like a cute like a nice like, like,
1662440	1664800	yeah, they don't have to be a fundamentalist.
1664800	1666760	They're not like snakes wrapped around their necks.
1666960	1670920	Most Christians are in the end of decapitation.
1671120	1675240	I don't know, man, we debunk that stereotype.
1676040	1679800	It is it is an awesome, terrifying God, the Old Testament God, though.
1680000	1682080	I just got in a weird
1682280	1686240	conversation about that with Aaron, because I was we were talking about
1686440	1691120	my my Hebrew name, Daniel, and how I like that story in the Bible and
1691320	1692480	the Old Testament God.
1692680	1695320	And I was kind of talking about how I like that God.
1695320	1697280	And she was kind of she's a pastor's daughter.
1697280	1699080	So she kind of like, I don't know, she did it.
1699280	1699960	She had a differently.
1700160	1703000	She wasn't have an objective.
1703800	1706840	It was I was I was somehow offending her on accident.
1706840	1709520	I didn't mean to. I was just being Joseph Cambly about it.
1709560	1712840	I was like, well, what offense did you take?
1713040	1716480	I don't know. We were probably both drunk and she surely not.
1716680	1720840	I think that I think that she took it to mean somehow that I had that I had a that
1721040	1723720	I that I preferred it to the New Testament God.
1723920	1726440	I don't know or that same God, isn't it?
1726640	1731480	Well, I mean, meaning that he had a new attitude, I think.
1731680	1733400	I think that part of the appeal of modern
1733600	1738320	Christianity is that some of the barbarism and misogyny and things that were
1738320	1743960	that that the Old Testament steeped in have been somehow can be somehow opted
1744160	1748520	out by way of the Terminator 2 like like movie.
1748720	1752000	You go like, OK, well, you've heard it this way, but now it's like this,
1752200	1755760	which is a huge value add to this. I love the New Testament.
1755960	1756680	I like reading it.
1756880	1760640	And I sometimes like it's a good thing to read when you're
1760640	1762400	meditating or something, you'll find a little verse.
1762600	1765800	But you really do have to wade through like you have to have a big
1765960	1770160	filter to read any part of the New Testament because it's pretty dense.
1770360	1771520	It's not just that it's dense.
1771720	1775360	It's just always it always ends in like there's I was just reading this verse in
1775560	1779160	it, which is like Christ is sending the disciples out into the world to
1779360	1781360	to to spread the message.
1781560	1785640	And he says to them, you know, we go into a town and if they accept you,
1785840	1789040	you know, give them your blessing and if they don't accept you at the gates of the
1789240	1794160	town, shake the dust from your feet and say to them, your town is fucked.
1794160	1795520	You're so cursed.
1795720	1796720	Yeah, yeah, I remember that one.
1796920	1799840	Like it's a crater. Your town is going to be a crater now.
1799840	1802360	So yeah, go around, go around and check up on them.
1802560	1804120	And then as you're leaving, you don't like it.
1804320	1808640	Give them the and which means like you're going to get blown up.
1808840	1812000	And like I was listening to I like listening to Christian radio.
1812000	1815680	It's really fun to listen to Christian radio and
1815880	1820520	highly recommend listening to Christian music and pretending that you're Jesus
1820520	1822960	and that the songs.
1826800	1828960	What the fuck?
1830040	1832440	How do those wires get crushed?
1832640	1837720	No, I was very clear about because you will realize how creeped out Jesus would
1837920	1841960	be by Christians if you listen to the way they sing to him.
1842160	1844120	It's like stalker music.
1844120	1845800	I said, love each other and they killed me.
1846000	1847640	Why use what is this song about?
1847840	1850480	Yeah, well, that's I mean, this is the this is the problem that I
1850680	1857360	have I that I sometimes run into because I'm a I'm a respected person among people
1857360	1859520	who are very intelligent. They like their science fiction.
1859520	1865040	These are personalities that don't typically come with rosary beads attached to them.
1865240	1871960	And modern Christianity is is, you know, it's what modern American Christianity.
1871960	1873880	What is that? That's not connected at all
1874080	1879480	to to the value of this mythology, which is that there was this guy who was kind
1879640	1881800	of awesome. He's a heroic figure.
1882000	1885920	He really, you know, it's like we we love Martin Luther King Jr.
1886120	1890440	like like like Jesus was like kind of kind of did a lot of that kind of shit.
1890640	1895360	Like, yeah, like sacrificed himself because he believed in people being nice to each
1895560	1898960	other. As far as the myth goes, it's like very empowering.
1899160	1902440	The idea of that that you can be this is Christmas time.
1902640	1907120	Christ miss like the Christ Christ word means half man, half God.
1907120	1911840	Right. Like this is a the idea of Christ is supposed to be the idea.
1912040	1914560	I thought that we can all do this.
1914760	1919080	We can all we all have it within us to
1919280	1924560	wield the power of these old Babylonian Sumerian kind of Mesopotamian like
1924760	1929880	boogeymen, like who make the thunder crack and who make the cancer bloom and who make
1930080	1935320	the cows die overnight, like all that cosmic chaos that we used to just chalk up
1935320	1939880	to fuck my luck or some weird superstition.
1940080	1946120	We can start to embody that power, take control of it and and and because as we're
1946320	1950680	doing that, we have a responsibility to each other to value human life and stuff.
1950880	1955960	So like like like that, that what does that have to do with Billy Graham?
1956160	1958640	Nothing. That's why that's why the Gnostics say
1958840	1963920	that or I've read that the Gnostics say that in Graham Hancock, who's this really
1964080	1968440	amazing, like far out historian is like believes that like humans have been here
1968640	1973480	much longer. And he he was telling me that
1973680	1978880	the Gnostics believe that so Satan, the first thing Satan is going to do is
1979080	1982640	convince everyone that he is God or that he is Jesus.
1982640	1983480	That's the move.
1983680	1986880	You convince people that you're you're the Lord of love.
1987080	1991000	And that's the person that George Bush worshiped is actually Satan.
1991080	1993600	Modern Christianity is actually Satanism
1993800	2000000	because only only Satan would tell a president, you should drop bombs on our
2000200	2004880	back. No, no, no Lord of love would say that.
2005080	2006560	Like Jesus is all love.
2006760	2011440	Jesus represents love, like love at all costs, love no matter what.
2011640	2013840	Love everyone and forget about yourself.
2014040	2016720	You lose yourself completely in love.
2016920	2019400	And that's the that's what I think Christianity is.
2019520	2024600	But somehow it gets diverted and they say this is because of the that Roman emperor
2024800	2028120	who recognized that Christianity was spreading and wanted to make it a state
2028120	2031080	religion. And that's why they had that gathering of people.
2031280	2035200	They're like, OK, this love thing's great, but we still need to decapitate and murder
2035400	2036840	people and set things on fire.
2037040	2037840	So what?
2038040	2042120	Just set up all these weird rules, like a country club, like about the Trinity and
2042320	2045280	what pants you can wear. And yeah, it's all ridiculous.
2045280	2050760	I mean, but and by the way, so is so is any like organized sect of Taoism,
2050960	2055520	Buddhism, like if you if you if you let the bread out long enough like all you
2055720	2058960	got, you come back 10 minutes later and the biggest dickhead in the room is in
2059160	2063480	charge like the guy who says, like, let's all let's all do it this way and let's all
2063480	2065160	do it that way. Go fuck yourself.
2065360	2070360	Like religion is supposed to be a personal tie between an individual or the unknown.
2070560	2074520	The very concept of organized religion is incredibly problematic.
2074520	2078440	Now, I'm not saying let's do away with organizing spiritual
2078640	2082040	conversations, organizing spirit religion at all.
2082240	2085560	But what I am saying is that that's it's just like that's not religion.
2085560	2088960	The things that you're talking to other people about are not your your
2089160	2091040	your relationship with the unknown.
2091240	2093920	Jesus said that, by the way, I mean, he said a lot of shit.
2094120	2098160	But but he talked about how basically prayers that you do in front of other
2098360	2103200	people are they're they're fine and good, but they're not.
2103200	2103960	They don't really count.
2104080	2107680	Yeah, he said, don't pray on the street corners like whoever they are.
2107680	2112120	Do I can't remember that you should be in a closet somewhere like meditating about
2112320	2115880	this, like, like, like, like really atoning with this thing that can fuck you up.
2116080	2119560	You know that book, The Sacred Mushroom in the Cross by John Marcus Allegro.
2119560	2121000	Have you ever heard of that? Like it.
2121200	2125200	I have a quote on the dust jacket.
2125400	2129520	Got devil in the baked beans is by whatever you just said.
2129720	2132120	That's the devil in the baked beans was his second.
2132240	2137520	I'm largely responsible for that book's tremendous sales.
2139640	2144040	His theory is that Christianity, what started as a mushroom cult and he has all
2144240	2148280	these amazing pictures of what do you mean by mushroom cult, a mushroom cult
2148480	2151960	where the the early that Jesus was a mushroom and that the whole thing was
2151960	2155680	like talking about the information they were getting was coming from eating
2155880	2159800	mushrooms like the God sacrifice was imbibing mushrooms.
2160000	2164680	The communion was actually mushrooms, which is why I went like the instruction
2164880	2168960	for communion is before you take communion, you should forgive your enemies.
2168960	2172160	You have to make sure that you forgiven everyone because it's if you're going to
2172160	2175600	go on a mushroom trip and you go there in a bad headspace, it'll be terrible.
2175800	2178720	So the whole thing is like a veiled mushroom cult.
2178720	2182840	And there's awesome pictures of like in these early Christian churches of Adam
2182840	2186960	and Eve and they're standing underneath clearly a mushroom like they're standing
2186960	2189640	next to there's all these pictures of mushrooms.
2189840	2194920	And it's like this is a what's that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
2195120	2197880	was actually a mushroom. And that's Terrence McKenna's idea,
2198080	2203560	which is like the stone dape theory that like proto hominids took mushrooms.
2203760	2209040	And that's what caused this massive expansion of the neocortex way back when
2209240	2212440	it's because mushrooms grow on the shit of bovine animals,
2212640	2215560	which is what are early proto hominids would have been hunting.
2215560	2218440	And since we're omnivores, we would have been eating the mushrooms.
2218440	2221840	I could believe that because there's a shared experience on mushrooms,
2222040	2226720	like psilocybin has a sort of set of almost inarticulable.
2226920	2234520	But by now we've figured out that it's shared the type of consciousness shift
2234720	2237720	that you have on mushrooms. It always has.
2237720	2238800	I mean, sometimes you have a bad trip.
2239000	2242160	Sometimes you think your friend is a Dracula.
2242320	2247240	Sometimes you come to Harvard town wearing underwear and a Santa hat.
2248120	2251800	Oh, that's that's the Russian equivalent of ho ho ho.
2252000	2253480	That's it.
2256280	2261360	But but but but that because it really is like this weird like people talk about,
2261560	2267760	you know, like straight lace people who would never like who associate drugs
2267960	2272080	with criminality and but who for one reason or another ended up taking this
2272280	2278320	psilocybin thing, they report the same experience as a groovy dude.
2278520	2284800	They have the same sort of weird momentary realization about about perspective
2285000	2290200	and an uplifting one, not one that makes you feel like a meaningless speck in an
2290200	2293480	infinite universe, but one that makes you feel like you're connected to all things.
2293480	2297640	Yeah. And imagine doing that instead of doing it at a party or in your apartment.
2297800	2304040	Imagine being in some early ancient Christian church with incense burning
2304240	2307400	and people saying these weird chants and you're eating the mushrooms with the
2307600	2309280	intention of connecting with the Godhead.
2309480	2311720	That would be a very intense trip.
2311920	2316160	But, you know, it would be it'd be amazing,
2316160	2320920	which is why sometimes I think of modern Christianity as people who only like
2321120	2325680	it's like people who have stacked wood and they're putting their hands in front
2325680	2329640	of the wood and pretending there's a fire there, but they haven't lit the wood
2329840	2333360	on fire and the psychedelic is what ignites the fire.
2333560	2337760	And that's what really creates the true feeling of the presence of God.
2337960	2341000	By the way, you know, the whole thing about Christmas, of course,
2341200	2345600	and Santa Claus is actually a representation of the Ammonita Mascaria mushroom.
2345800	2347320	Have you ever heard that? No.
2347520	2350320	Yeah, man, totally.
2351120	2353640	Everybody, everybody right now, reach under your seats.
2353640	2355920	You'll find a mushroom.
2356680	2358440	Yeah, no, it's 45 minutes.
2358640	2360440	It's just going to get wow.
2361040	2363400	There's a lot of stuff on the Internet about it, Google search it.
2363600	2367440	But the color of the Ammonita Mascaria mushroom is red and white,
2367640	2370840	which is exactly the color that Santa Claus wears.
2371040	2374480	But that was a later day thing that he was originally not red and white.
2374680	2379120	That was a very later day, 50s, 40s Coca Cola thing like that.
2379320	2381960	He was green and white up until very recently.
2381960	2385400	Well, sometimes the Ammonita Mascaria is a green and white.
2385600	2387240	Yeah. All right.
2388440	2392520	Whatever fits into my mushroom story, asshole.
2392720	2394680	You know, one thing that
2394880	2398520	that academics, I love the angle, though, that like, what if we just did prove
2398520	2400600	that Santa and Jesus was just all about mushrooms?
2400800	2403160	Yeah, I don't think it's that big a leap.
2403360	2406360	I mean, I really don't. It's yeah.
2406560	2407640	Well, yeah.
2407640	2411080	Well, also, also they say that the druids
2411280	2415520	would hang these mushrooms to dry on pine trees.
2415720	2420800	And that that's that's the whole like, like hanging shit on trees actually comes
2421000	2425560	from drying these mushrooms out to do this like psychedelic ritual.
2425760	2429640	And I'll shut up about mushrooms, but there's one more point I want to make,
2429840	2434480	which is that the druids would drink each other's piss.
2434520	2439280	Because if you eat mushrooms, the psilocybin still stays in the urine.
2439280	2440840	And so they couldn't get enough.
2441040	2441880	They couldn't get enough.
2442080	2446320	Yeah. Or they drink their own piss to like start tripping again, which you can do.
2446520	2451440	And they used to actually leave out a plate and glass of piss.
2452440	2453480	Yes.
2453680	2454760	You know this.
2454960	2457440	I read the book.
2457640	2460080	You know, one thing one thing that I
2460800	2466000	went through like a like a heavy duty kind of like, I think
2466200	2470520	getting more into Jesus mythology because of Campbell and stuff like that.
2470720	2474440	So I started I watched Jesus Christ Superstar again and was like, this is
2474640	2479200	this is really cool and started why I watched some documentaries and stuff.
2479200	2481280	And Campbell so compelled you by the myth
2481280	2484320	of Jesus Christ that you went right out and rented Jesus Christ Superstar.
2484520	2486480	I did. And that's that's a catchy one, man.
2486680	2488200	I took Erin to see that New York.
2488200	2488840	She was blown away.
2488840	2490480	She had only ever seen God spell man.
2490680	2496040	Jesus Christ, that will convert you to eat God spells like for breakfast.
2496240	2496640	All right.
2496840	2498520	So one more thing and then we'll get off
2498520	2500520	of Jesus because I just got off of him an hour ago.
2500520	2502080	You know what I'm saying?
2507960	2512400	Justin, can we can we edit in the lightning and thunder?
2513080	2513920	Or sleigh bells.
2514120	2516880	I thought one of the bit, but there's biblical historians,
2516880	2520360	you know, kind of line between academics and, you know, you know,
2520560	2526920	the people that are sort of researching the actual historical person, Jesus.
2527360	2532560	There's some of them believe that the reason for
2532760	2537880	sort of his personality, his character, his message that he brought was that as a
2538080	2541440	as a youngster growing up, he was an apprentice to his dad who probably would
2541440	2543600	have been a stone mason, not a carpenter.
2543800	2544840	And I don't know.
2544840	2545960	Did he grow up in Jerusalem?
2545960	2551720	Or was it wherever he was like spending his his younger years when when you kind
2551920	2555440	of like don't I think it wasn't he was Jesus of Nazareth.
2555640	2557480	Yeah, thank you, sir.
2559960	2564400	But but is he Jesus who hung out in Nazareth till he was 38 or is he Jesus
2564600	2568520	who was born in Nazareth and like he was he was born in Long Beach.
2568720	2570520	Yeah. And then he lived in that.
2570720	2574920	Anyways, when he was apprenticing for his dad, he would have been in this
2574960	2580040	tremendous port city being a stone mason and would have been exposed if he was
2580240	2584400	going if he was working in imports and exports as a stone mason might in that
2584600	2591240	city like like kind of been exposed to a lot of Eastern philosophy coming coming
2591440	2596240	in off of those those same docs, I don't know, talking out of my butt.
2596240	2597680	But I always thought that was interesting.
2597880	2599040	Ask some academic.
2599040	2602800	But Eastern philosophy from the west side of Africa.
2605320	2611120	It's the least wonderful time of the year.
2611320	2613600	Adam Goldberg starts the stage.
2613800	2616920	I don't know. I got my wish from Gretchen Santa.
2617120	2618920	How's it going? That's really warm.
2618920	2620600	You're really warm. I'm not going to touch you anymore.
2620800	2622560	You're really warm.
2622760	2626720	All right. What what what topic do you have ownership over this evening?
2626920	2631000	What is it that we said that made you entitled to
2631200	2636680	look religion, the idea that the majority of religion, how much of religion did you
2636880	2642720	attribute to mushrooms? At least all of it are just the big one that the other ones.
2642920	2647720	I didn't I didn't attribute to I was I was citing a book that this isn't a TED
2647920	2652360	talk or a Senate hearing like nothing's nothing's going to happen if you don't do
2652360	2653960	anything.
2654160	2654640	You're right.
2654840	2658280	If you just listen, the worst case scenario is a good show.
2658480	2659400	That's it.
2659600	2662160	If you just listen, no, there's no nothing.
2662160	2663600	No, nobody's going to kick in your door
2663600	2665920	tomorrow night and like go, you didn't say anything.
2665920	2668000	When Duncan Trussell said mushrooms were religion.
2668200	2671000	Now they came for Duncan Trussell and I did nothing.
2671000	2673880	And then they came for the stone masons and I did nothing.
2673880	2675120	And then they kicked in my door.
2675120	2676680	Don't bring the Holocaust into this.
2676880	2681240	I wasn't I was going to bring in the expulsion that happened 400 years ago
2681240	2682400	and Prague, but whatever.
2682600	2688280	So religion is a really important personal force.
2688480	2692480	I believe that a lot of what our spiritual journeys do take place internally.
2692680	2697320	But the idea that the representation of religion is something that people go
2697520	2703160	together to ignore God and just to to worship a fire that isn't there just
2703360	2708440	seems problematic as someone who's had a lot of his religious.
2708640	2711600	I played the fuck out of Linus when I was in Charlie Brown.
2711600	2713720	I did not puke on my director when I was in.
2713720	2718960	Oh, is that all he said?
2719160	2722360	I was going to end my speech by singing
2722560	2730080	Mary, we wish you a Merry Christmas, but I'm going to get all right.
2730280	2734240	As someone who's had a lot of wonderful experiences being around people around
2734440	2738240	the Christmas tree, spending the holidays, letting them know or doing things
2738440	2742400	like that, when you see religion as something that doesn't connect you one way
2742600	2746240	to God, but you to God, to everyone else that you're willing to spend time with.
2746440	2749600	Religion can be a wonderful social leveler.
2749600	2751280	It can be a reason to get out of your house.
2751480	2753240	It can be a reason to visit the invalid.
2753440	2757920	And charity and especially Christian charity is not something that is easy.
2758120	2761760	It is something that we choose to do because of what we believe to help people
2761960	2767200	out who are less fortunate, who are more Goldbergian than Harmonian.
2767360	2770440	Let's say in our society, I'm not
2770640	2774200	you're booing me and you prove my point, but
2774560	2778640	the losers, the people who trip over the words, the people who have the only tie
2778840	2783120	that we have to them in our society is that they had their names written in the
2783120	2787360	same type of book in the beginning of pages where you keep the family history,
2787560	2791160	the same scroll, the same commandments.
2791360	2792960	That's
2794800	2796800	crucify him.
2798200	2801560	He's here to save Christmas, you guys.
2801760	2804320	Adam Goldberg came on stage to the reason that we go.
2804320	2806320	We go into the cold and the snow when we
2806520	2811320	rather be playing Xbox and we sing, we wish you a merry Christmas.
2811520	2813360	We wish you a merry Christmas.
2813560	2818640	We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
2818840	2820520	Thank you.
2820720	2823760	Adam Goldberg, everybody.
2823920	2827160	What's your mind, a reindeer?
2827360	2828560	What?
2828760	2830400	He wants to know where his reindeer are.
2830600	2831800	Something about his reindeer.
2832000	2833200	Guys,
2834200	2836520	Duncan Anatoly, can we can we talk a little
2836720	2841600	bit about this, because I have some I have some opinions about this song.
2844000	2849600	In my estimation, the shittiest Christmas song ever ever perpetrated on mankind.
2849800	2851080	This is a bad one.
2851320	2854520	I've even heard that Paul McCartney is ashamed of himself for this.
2854720	2857880	Not so ashamed that he's had it stricken from the record, but I'm proud of you
2857880	2859680	because every year, Jeff and I have a tradition.
2859680	2862240	We try to make it as far as we can without hearing this song.
2862240	2865760	Also, I don't like what I heard in the Uber on the way over here.
2865960	2868240	Duncan, what is this before we get to it?
2868440	2869560	There's another song.
2869760	2871600	Jingle Jingle Bell Rock.
2871800	2876080	The line Giddy up Jingle Horse makes me want to take my own life.
2876280	2879000	Don't fucking say Giddy up Jingle Horse.
2879200	2880760	Jingle Horse isn't a fucking thing.
2880880	2881920	It's not an icon.
2882120	2884040	It's not an iconic Christmas thing.
2884240	2887800	Jingle Horse, go fuck everybody that ever sang it, but wrote it.
2888000	2892320	But more importantly, let's can we all can we all just go go after this
2892520	2896120	Harman town, find Paul McCartney, wherever he is, and sing this on his
2896320	2902040	doorstep for 72 hours and make him because I walked into a shop and when he
2902240	2905360	asked us to go away, we say why it was good enough for us.
2905560	2906880	I was. Yeah. Wasn't it?
2907080	2908320	When you wrote, what's this song?
2908360	2910440	When you when you wrote that on a cocktail
2910640	2915280	napkin on the way to the studio, the first Christmas Carol I heard because it was
2915480	2919440	it was August, you know, I went to see a movie and they started the Christmas
2919640	2924040	Carols early, of course, and the first one I heard, I walked in and Duncan,
2924240	2930920	treat yourself to these rich, majestic, mythic, literally like in the lyrics,
2931120	2935200	like, says fuck it, like, almost almost literally says everything, but fuck it.
2935200	2938400	Fuck it. You know, fucking I fuck who gives a shit?
2938600	2940840	The mood is right.
2941120	2943440	The spirit's up.
2943640	2945920	We're here tonight.
2946120	2947280	And that's enough.
2947480	2949200	Fuck it.
2949600	2950840	Simply having.
2951040	2953280	Why did they say it's called out?
2953480	2954560	There's lights. I don't know.
2954760	2956080	Simply go fuck yourself.
2956280	2958200	Simply ignoring the rules of show.
2958400	2959840	Don't tell.
2960840	2966280	Simply shoehorning into the Christmas business.
2966480	2968800	The tree is green.
2969000	2970200	The moon is round.
2970400	2972280	The Christ was born.
2973960	2975080	Maybe it's about mushrooms.
2975280	2978840	Simply, simply, simply.
2979040	2981280	Yeah. How about make it a little more complex?
2981480	2983560	My boots are on.
2983760	2985440	Snow is white.
2985640	2987400	I met a guy.
2987560	2989760	He was had a mustache.
2989960	2995160	Simply having a wonderful Christmas time.
2995360	2999200	Simply having a wonderful Christmas time.
2999400	3000560	No.
3000760	3001880	The party's on.
3002080	3003040	OK. Party's on.
3003240	3004280	The feeling's here.
3004480	3005320	Which feeling?
3005520	3006520	Which one?
3007120	3008120	OK.
3008320	3010120	This time of year.
3010320	3012120	Simply having a wonderful Christmas time.
3012320	3014640	OK. You know what this is?
3014840	3016880	Because there is a dark moment in the song.
3016880	3018840	We go beep.
3019040	3020640	Listen to the instrumentation.
3020840	3027800	It was just like it was it was it was composed by a kid shopping at Sears.
3028400	3030480	Pressing demo buttons.
3030680	3036120	No, you know, it's I'm surprised Greensleeves isn't in there somewhere on accident.
3036320	3041880	It sounds like what they blast to people in Guantanamo Bay.
3042080	3046680	This is how we got Noriega with this fucking song.
3046880	3050080	Simply having a wonderful Christmas time.
3050280	3051680	It's an abomination.
3051880	3058400	The choir of children sing their song.
3058600	3060840	Minor key for no reason.
3061040	3064360	Listen, if you go to a minor key, if you go to a minor key,
3064560	3066960	he fucking wrote yesterday in Blackbird and shit.
3067160	3069240	He's Paul McCartney. He's a songwriter.
3069440	3070440	He wrote some goodies.
3070640	3074000	He also wrote fucking Maxwell Silverhammer, which can go fuck itself.
3074120	3077440	But that's it.
3078640	3082080	He was in a band with fucking John Lennon and George Harrison.
3082080	3084160	He could have he could have fucking stepped it up a couple of times.
3084160	3086080	Somebody needs to play that song backwards.
3086080	3087600	Has anyone done that? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3087800	3088840	Yeah, you get tomorrow.
3088840	3094440	I never know. It's fucking about somebody I know said that they were on a set
3094640	3099200	with Ringo Starr and and they were like the crew was like, yeah, we got Ringo Starr.
3099400	3102160	My favorite Beatles, you know, George Harrison, my favorite Beatles, John Lennon.
3102320	3104960	And it's almost like, you know, Paul McCartney, like a fucking guy,
3105160	3107840	like he he wrote, you know, he wrote a lot of bullshit songs.
3107840	3109040	I mean, I guess he wrote a couple of good ones.
3109040	3111400	But like most of the time, like he wrote this one and that one.
3111600	3115320	And Ringo, you know, who had every reason to not like Paul walked up and goes, oh,
3115520	3118480	so you're you're taking the shit out of my out of our Polly.
3118520	3120680	He goes, he wrote a couple of good ones, too.
3120880	3123720	Like, like, like, like, like whatever shit you talk about, Paul McCartney,
3123920	3127960	you have to he did fucking write a lot of fucking goodies.
3128120	3133160	Now, in high relief to the fucking beautiful artwork that he made,
3133360	3135160	this happens.
3137120	3139160	Ding, dong, ding, dong.
3139200	3141320	That's what the kids are saying.
3141520	3144200	If you're going to go to a minor key, it has to go to a dark place.
3144400	3148240	Mythologically, you have to say, but it wasn't as we, but can you back it up?
3148240	3153000	Because I want everyone to hear the entire what the choir of children sing
3153200	3155760	because there's three parts to it.
3158120	3160680	Simply
3162520	3169760	it's nothing simple about the choir of children sing their song.
3172160	3173800	Here's their song.
3174000	3178840	Ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, dong, ding.
3179000	3180760	Oh,
3186440	3188560	oh, oh, oh, oh,
3189640	3193840	the kids are as fucked up as McCartney like, I don't know.
3194040	3197800	He throws it to them and they're like, fuck you back.
3198000	3200000	Yes, yes.
3201560	3203160	We're all riffing, right, Paul?
3203360	3204160	Yes.
3204360	3206880	Out by five.
3207880	3213360	The choir of kids, kids, take it, take it, fuck you, take it back.
3213560	3216520	Jingle, jingle, fuck yourself.
3216720	3219760	Ding, dong, ding, dong.
3220960	3223640	Well, we'll take your word for it.
3229200	3230840	The word is out.
3232040	3233800	The party is down.
3236880	3245840	Okay, I've always given up on the side a lot before that happened.
3246040	3248280	We're usually deep in conversation by the side.
3248480	3250680	What does he say? What is that?
3250880	3255400	I think he said he wants to lift a glass and he doesn't know how.
3257600	3260120	You know, you don't look down.
3260320	3262400	Wait, what is he saying?
3262600	3264200	Are we Santa?
3264200	3267560	He's like, oh, yeah, lift your glass.
3267760	3269400	Yeah, it's not worth it.
3269600	3271000	Fuck it.
3275200	3277240	Now, now we're down the rabbit hole.
3277440	3278840	Now I want my.
3279040	3284760	What if at this point in the song, it was just plans for D-Day or something?
3284960	3285960	No one had ever heard it.
3286160	3289240	Yes, my Social Security number.
3289440	3293640	The cure for cancer makes us two parts soft and sick.
3293800	3295400	Take it, kids.
3295600	3299680	They practiced all year long.
3300880	3301880	Yeah.
3307680	3309480	Now you.
3311760	3312760	Wait.
3313600	3317120	Yeah, we're here tonight.
3317320	3318680	And that's enough.
3318880	3319160	That's it.
3319360	3321600	Like I say, like it's all it's required.
3321760	3324960	Throw some fucking mistletoe for Christmas.
3325160	3330920	Simply fulfilling an album of record label contractual agreement.
3332760	3333840	Fuck him.
3334040	3337160	Now, Dan, you know, it was maybe two Christmases ago.
3337160	3337920	Was it last year?
3338120	3338880	Was it last Christmas?
3339080	3341800	Three. Three because it was the first time I kissed Aaron.
3342000	3347040	Oh, I remember the night you're talking about because I know the next song you want
3347240	3351240	to play because I love as I think I don't know.
3351400	3352440	I just turned 40.
3352640	3359840	I grew up on the Peanuts Christmas specials and brilliantly.
3360040	3362560	They chose Vince Geraldi Trio to do all that music.
3362760	3366160	And it's like you don't have to like jazz to love Vince Geraldi Trio.
3366360	3368600	And if you don't like jazz,
3368800	3373600	listen to Vince Geraldi Trio and at least dig him and the boys.
3373800	3378080	And the music and the Peanuts specials is really melancholy.
3378280	3379160	It's really sad.
3379160	3382520	It's kind of blow your brains out darkness to it.
3382720	3385720	But it's also for me, the Christmas
3385920	3388560	like from like I have really fond Christmas memories.
3388760	3392040	I grew up in a nice small family and everybody got along more or less.
3392240	3393880	And Christmas was always fun.
3394080	3395640	But the music is sad.
3395840	3400840	And Charles Schultz had to fight for the darkness and the Peanuts specials.
3401040	3405400	But they all and what a good fight because the whole point of it is it is solstice.
3405400	3407560	It's that everything gets quiet.
3408000	3412360	And you put up an evergreen tree to convince yourself that the sun will come out tomorrow.
3412560	3415560	There's an automatic bubblegum flavor to Christmas that.
3415760	3418840	Yeah, I think it's it's like fun to overcome
3419040	3423520	encounter with the natural kind of stillness and darkness because I love I'll
3423520	3427120	be home for Christmas because I believe and I'm sure that somebody will prove me
3427120	3430640	wrong on this one. But as far as I know, I'll be home for Christmas was came out
3430840	3434120	during World War Two and it's whether it came out before that.
3434320	3435760	That was a big hit for the troops because
3435760	3441160	the idea that I'll be home if only in my dreams and families heard that song and
3441360	3445240	it's really dark and it's the idea that like please have snow mistletoe and they
3445240	3447680	bury the lead at the end like I won't be home for Christmas.
3447880	3451120	I might be in Italy. I might be in in the Ardennes.
3451320	3453840	I might be I might be Ken in the Kaiser.
3454040	3456000	Well, that's World War One.
3457560	3460040	I might be Rosie Riveton.
3460240	3462080	But like and what's the one you like, Dan?
3462080	3462760	You have your favorite.
3462760	3463360	I like that one.
3463360	3467000	Which is the one that says through the years we all will be together if the fates
3467200	3473440	allow. So it's a similar thought, but it doesn't tie you to military service.
3474520	3478400	We are all in the military because we're all at war with an uncompromising,
3478600	3484400	fucking sometimes unpredictable, jealous, crazy God that like creates ice ages and
3484600	3489760	and freezes your crops and and and and plays roller coaster with the infant
3489760	3496040	mortality rate and and and and has viruses and grasshoppers eat your face.
3496240	3499480	The the this time of atonement with that
3499680	3503800	impersonal cosmic force, you know, yeah, going like like we're all we're all in
3503800	3507800	that military service going like I'll maybe I'll be you know, Christmas.
3508000	3510320	It's it's it's the highest suicide rate of the year.
3510320	3512000	We all know that. Like, is that true?
3512200	3514840	Or is that just an urban myth? That's from Gremlins.
3515040	3517320	I mean, that it is.
3517320	3520200	That's from Gremlins after midnight.
3520400	3523160	Gremlins, Adam, damn it, Adam, Adam.
3523360	3525080	Go to bed.
3527400	3528880	What's your take on Adam Duncan?
3529080	3532200	Like, you even I got to say, man, I thought it was very sweet.
3532200	3534560	What he did when he came up here, what was he doing?
3534560	3535600	I don't even know what he was doing.
3535720	3538240	I don't know if he was like mad about religion or he came up.
3538440	3542040	He came up to defend the the the God in Christmas.
3542240	3543720	Yes. What's he doing that for?
3543920	3546800	What am I doing? What was it? What?
3547000	3550720	He said we're in a military against God and grasshoppers will eat our face.
3550920	3553680	So he's got to kill people, man.
3553880	3557280	He's like, wait, you don't you don't just hang out with him in a hammock.
3557480	3561960	Like, like the God, is it God, is it Superman?
3562160	3564240	He doesn't save us from train crashes.
3564440	3565960	Well, that causes them to.
3566160	3567160	That's why you need.
3567360	3572040	That's why in Hinduism, you need a Shiva to make sense of the whole thing.
3572240	3575080	Like in Christianity, things get really weird
3575240	3578040	because you have this apparently all I want to talk about.
3578040	3582120	I want to talk about Adam Goldberg and what a dick he is.
3582960	3585400	Because he only just wanted to come on stage.
3585600	3587680	And in order to come on stage, he needed a point.
3587680	3590040	And his point needed to be contrary to something else.
3590240	3594200	But it wasn't like it doesn't because on any other given day,
3594400	3598480	Adam would be coming up here reminding us that we should be skeptical of
3598680	3602440	of the Christian God because people got birds at the stake and got leeches put on them.
3602440	3603480	You know that Adam is hard.
3603480	3605800	And it's three sizes too small.
3606000	3610680	He just I mean, like, at least don't don't don't lose the don't lose the moment.
3610880	3614760	Like, like if you if if the if the stage is a big pink box with a red ribbon on it,
3614960	3617280	fucking open it up and thank us for it.
3617280	3620440	Like, like, let us get some pictures of you and your Easter bunny.
3620640	3623160	I agree with you. I think that was Adam's motivation.
3623160	3625880	I think so, Adam. But also, I think you did come up with the idea
3626080	3629600	that you were trying to defend strangely Christmas.
3629800	3633000	But also, I mean, nobody up here was really trying to defame Christmas,
3633040	3636200	I don't think I'm trying to bring that shit back.
3637240	3638240	Dan, you want to bring it back?
3638440	3640600	I'm saving Christmas up here.
3640800	3643040	Can we can we bring it back with a song that we got first?
3643240	3646320	Because, again, like I said, I yeah, we love the big grandi trio.
3646440	3647120	So you all know this.
3647120	3648320	I'll play the vocal version first.
3648320	3651760	So we all know this is the hardest we've ever laughed in our lives.
3651960	3654120	So let's just dig the original version first.
3654320	3656080	OK, so we can hear the kids from Peanuts.
3656280	3657440	Sing it.
3657760	3660840	There's a sign.
3661040	3662160	Fuck you, Paul McCartney.
3662160	3664240	This is a fucking good song.
3674960	3679240	A really, really happy, beautiful lyric set against the most minor,
3679440	3683320	dark, beautiful, melancholic music of all time.
3683520	3686320	So what was the setup that we were just sitting around?
3686400	3691320	I was just drunk, just getting drunk and Dino's and I was in a good mood
3691520	3694840	because I kind of had a crush on this on this girl that was starting to hang around.
3695040	3698920	Right. And so I played the the the instrumental version.
3699120	3701320	So let's see if we can pull this up.
3702520	3706080	I think I started this and then we did this for the next 30 minutes.
3706280	3708280	And we laughed for three hours.
3708280	3709280	And.
3715960	3719320	Dicks and balls and beer.
3720880	3724600	Dicks and balls and beer.
3724800	3730000	The fire is warm, a perfect storm.
3730200	3734520	Dicks and balls and beer.
3734720	3737600	That's it. That's beautiful.
3737760	3739360	Beautiful.
3740200	3743080	Well, it was because we were giggling because you were singing
3743280	3748520	dicks and balls and beer to the song and then it was kind of giggling and just drunk
3748720	3752240	and it was late and and then it was it was 3 p.m.
3752440	3753880	And then he said,
3754080	3758320	well, yeah, compared to whenever we were we woke up.
3758520	3763000	The fire is warm, the perfect storm.
3763200	3765280	That's when I lost it.
3765920	3770480	Dicks and balls and beer are the perfect storm.
3770680	3772640	Christmas time.
3774840	3779040	Like some tactician is looking at that on a piece of paper.
3779240	3780960	Jesus Christ, get out of here.
3781160	3784400	There's going to be dicks, balls and beer at that party.
3784600	3785640	Perfect storm.
3785840	3788280	It's fucking Christmas.
3791120	3792280	Perfect storm.
3792440	3796120	It's a weird thing for children to sing.
3796320	3798400	The perfect storm.
3798600	3804640	It's weirder than dicks, balls and beer for children to be talking about the perfect storm.
3808040	3812080	You can't tell if the song's in favor of it or
3812280	3813640	just a dire production.
3813840	3816360	So shit's going to go down tonight.
3817120	3823400	I know that was like one of the few, the second, third, fourth times I met Aaron.
3823600	3827440	And she came to the door and I was like crying.
3827640	3829880	I'm streaked with tears right now, listeners.
3830080	3834320	And we were in there and we were absolutely apoplectic because we've been doing this
3834520	3837240	for an hour. We kept doing it.
3837440	3839240	And there was many verses to it.
3839440	3841240	And God damn it.
3841440	3845760	And she came in and we're like, well, it's a long story.
3846000	3849560	I went on a little walk with her that night and I remember the tree that we stopped
3849560	3852120	by outside Dino's place and I kissed her for the first time.
3852320	3854400	But we didn't start making out or anything.
3854600	3858800	It was still I was I leaned in and I kissed her.
3858800	3863040	And it was like I don't think I've ever had this experience where I just like she
3863240	3866760	just accepted the kiss, but nothing else happens.
3866960	3869320	And it was just sort of like Little House on the Prairie,
3869520	3873200	kind of like, oh, the courtship continues.
3874160	3877760	It was like weird, like we, yeah,
3877960	3882080	you know, a kiss usually like like evolves into something, but she was not she was
3882280	3884080	not ready, but was not rebuffing.
3884280	3890640	And so it just we just continued to like, we had a little barrel hoop that we ran
3890840	3896440	with a stick and I made her a crown out of daisies or something.
3896640	3900840	I went to read the Bible to my blind grandpa.
3901800	3904520	And then I fucked her.
3905440	3907080	Deep.
3909080	3910760	And she found it.
3914040	3916440	All right, let's have a special Christmas
3916640	3922720	meeting with the real, the actual father of winter,
3922920	3928280	the embodiment of the solstice, the Nordic
3928440	3933160	traveling, cold, cold, cold, immune
3933360	3938480	shorts in Times Square in January, wearing Spencer Crittenden.
3946680	3948400	Hey, hey,
3948600	3951360	hey, guys, you love the cold.
3951560	3953640	Yeah, yeah.
3953840	3954600	What's up?
3954800	3956480	What was that Paul McCartney song?
3956640	3959560	What was it simply having a wonderful Christmas time?
3959760	3960800	I take my word for it.
3961000	3965680	You can change one word of that song and it'd be any holiday.
3965880	3972320	Yeah, yeah, or or a day of the week or simply having a wonderful turkey sandwich.
3972520	3975840	Yeah, it's just sun is up.
3976040	3977040	The mood is right.
3977240	3979720	Yeah, the mayo is white.
3979920	3981480	Not even rhymes with white.
3981680	3983840	The mood can be right for a turkey sandwich.
3983840	3986960	Like it's it's just anything.
3987160	3990280	Yeah. Back massage.
3990480	3992080	A wonderful back massage.
3992280	3995960	You like in the have yourself a merry little Christmas, the idea that if
3996160	4000080	through the years we all be together, if the fates allow, that's a good lyric.
4000280	4003200	Yeah, like there's is there more to that song?
4003400	4007880	It's like kind of like I change one of the lyrics like the original version.
4008080	4009200	Get up here, get a mic.
4009400	4011040	This is too good.
4011240	4012840	If you like.
4014160	4015920	Yeah, so
4016120	4019400	ladies and gentlemen, Sean Connery.
4019600	4021360	Thank you.
4022240	4024160	So the original version of that song,
4024360	4029280	as it was written by whoever Sammy Conner, whoever wrote it out here.
4029480	4031000	Through the years, we all will be together.
4031200	4035400	If the fates allow until then, we'll have to muddle through somehow.
4035600	4037080	You know, melancholy.
4037280	4040080	Oh, and they change it to hang a shining star up on the highest.
4040280	4042920	That's kind of a non sequiturier version.
4043160	4043920	So, yeah.
4044120	4045480	Wow. Yeah.
4045680	4047600	The hang of shining star makes no sense.
4047600	4048520	No, it's a non sequiturier.
4048720	4052080	I'd be curious to know because I thought maybe Sammy Conner, one of those one of
4052280	4054320	those great like here. Yeah.
4054520	4056080	But like what year it would be if that were
4056080	4059080	a depression error or something like that, because or probably later than that.
4059280	4060880	Forties, forties, forties.
4061080	4061480	Yeah.
4061680	4066840	So but and I don't know exactly when that change happened.
4067040	4071120	I do know that I mean, it's but it might be the coolest thing in the world,
4071280	4074880	but it's hard to imagine singing that original lyric in the way that
4074880	4077840	traditionally you do, because that's that's the point where you really swell.
4078040	4081000	Hang a shining star up on the man out.
4081200	4083560	You go crazy. You go for it and bring it home.
4083760	4088320	Well, the Ella Fitzgerald version, she nails out.
4088520	4089400	She does it really well.
4089400	4091600	Because that's the return of the original version.
4091600	4094640	I don't know if it's the original, but she does a version of it.
4094840	4097360	She does the muddle through one or the she does the muddle through.
4097360	4098000	Yes, I've heard that.
4098200	4099640	I think Sinatra does it as well.
4099640	4102840	Yeah, I think that's I don't have it on here.
4103040	4104200	I got a lot of the old stuff.
4104200	4105480	That's that's a goodie. Yeah.
4105480	4107240	All right. What's your name, young man?
4107440	4111320	Dan Dan Dan Christmas memory, which can you lay one on us?
4111520	4113040	Or what about a Christmas wish?
4113040	4114960	Let's start granting some Christmas wishes.
4115160	4118600	Christmas memory and fuck you.
4118800	4120760	There goes your wish.
4121960	4124200	Well, there could be some wish fulfillment.
4124400	4127240	Now, my family, our tradition,
4127440	4129520	my oldest brother,
4131000	4135160	early, he wanted for Christmas more than anything else.
4135400	4137560	Nat King Cole's Christmas is for children.
4137760	4139120	And that was our family tradition.
4139120	4140520	We would decorate the tree with that.
4140520	4141760	Just plan on a loop.
4141960	4144640	And it's like, oh, we had a 28 minute long tape.
4144840	4145120	Yeah.
4145320	4148720	But we play it probably four or five times.
4148920	4151000	So do you have any Nat King Cole?
4151000	4152160	I have tons of Nat King Cole.
4152160	4153320	I don't know if it's off that record, though.
4153320	4153760	Let's see.
4153760	4156560	Oh, that would be your Christmas wish to be here a little bit today.
4157080	4157520	That's good.
4157520	4159200	I grant that here in town.
4159400	4162280	Do you want to be or some of the sad, like really like Christmasy stuff,
4162480	4165480	like he has the religious guy or the kids?
4165680	4168000	Yeah, he does like, you know, I got it.
4168200	4169920	I do have it. Hang on.
4173760	4174680	Yeah.
4174880	4182240	I put the ball to do everybody.
4182440	4185440	All I want for Christmas is my two friends.
4185520	4186160	Take a damn.
4186360	4189720	My two front teeth, my two front teeth.
4189920	4196960	She and I could only have my two front teeth and I wish Merry Christmas.
4197160	4200760	It's been so long since I could say
4200960	4204440	Sister Susie sitting on a thistle.
4204640	4211720	I'll show you how happy I'd be if I could only whistle.
4211880	4215400	All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth.
4215600	4219640	My two front teeth, my two front teeth.
4219840	4222760	If I could only have my two front teeth,
4222960	4226040	then I could wish you Merry Christmas.
4226240	4228000	Dan, everybody.
4229760	4230760	Wow.
4232200	4233200	Thank you.
4236080	4238400	Without any effort, we're doing a Christmas show.
4238600	4240400	Yeah, I'm seeing them.
4240480	4243840	Yeah, like the Gladys Knight and the Pimps are about to come out at some point.
4244040	4245920	That's what I love about this time of year.
4246120	4247440	It's effortless.
4247640	4255840	It's supported by an entire species history of this time of year being special.
4256040	4258600	I don't have to lecture you guys about it.
4258800	4263000	I certainly don't need to be attacked by Adam Goldberg about it.
4263200	4267120	I was I was I was really I was being the hero up here.
4267320	4269960	He tried to act like he was slaying Darth Vader.
4270200	4271200	I resent it.
4271400	4272960	I resent him.
4276680	4279600	Are you trying to tee up a Christmas miracle right now?
4279800	4284680	I'm going to come down from the he got up and I hope he would just went to the bathroom.
4284880	4287400	I hope we don't hear a single Christmas gunshot.
4287600	4289080	Christmas gunshot.
4289280	4291960	That's my favorite Christmas song.
4296840	4298640	Jingle bang.
4300920	4301400	Jingle.
4301600	4304840	That's the New York New York Post-Headline.
4309480	4311280	Jingle bell clock.
4312680	4316560	I honestly felt my life was being crushed.
4316760	4317640	I got physical.
4317640	4320600	I had an adrenaline rush when a skunk comes out.
4320800	4327520	I felt it in my my my third eye like before I even saw the motion combined with Rob
4327840	4333320	going no, no, no, because that's I'm pretty sure that's what Rob will sound like.
4333520	4337520	If someone shoots me, that's what it looks like.
4337720	4339560	That is what it looks like to die.
4339760	4342360	It's like a quick shadowy rushing in.
4342560	4343360	And that's it.
4343560	4346320	You're gone, you're gone, man.
4346520	4351760	Just a scuttling sound, a distant shriek and let Buzzfeed's twenty five reasons.
4351960	4355840	Dan Herman was interesting being the last you ever hear of him.
4357680	4358760	That was fast.
4358960	4359800	That was fast.
4360000	4363600	That was like like new zombie speed like the new.
4363800	4365200	I was driving through an intersection
4365400	4369600	with Schwab once we were like on Highland and Melrose, I think.
4369800	4377080	And and this fucking SUV, I looked up and there was an SUV coming full speed that
4377280	4382600	did not say I think we were we were going straight and the SUV was making a left
4382680	4388280	turn. We had the and so and so, you know, like he was we were going straight.
4388280	4392080	We had the right of way and this SUV just decided to continue its left turn.
4392280	4397280	And and so just we're in the middle of a conversation about Gary Shandling or
4397480	4401560	something and and then we were going to die
4401760	4404680	because we were going thirty five, forty five miles an hour.
4404880	4406720	And and and he so was he.
4406920	4412200	And somehow Schwab just went just cranked the wheel all the way.
4412200	4414120	And the end result was just somehow I
4414320	4419440	swear like molecules of the paint on the in the respective cars must have must
4419640	4424240	have rushed up against each other like but nothing other than it was just like
4424440	4428280	that it was just profound because that that's oh, that's what it feels like to
4428480	4431560	die except for the very end part, which is you die.
4431760	4434240	It is like that's that's what you see
4434440	4439480	when when this life is taken away from you.
4439640	4441640	Nothing, just garbage, just nothing.
4441840	4444680	Just an Adam Goldberg darting out of the shadows
4444880	4448800	and you're you won't be you won't you know, I won't I won't have time to fix my
4449000	4452320	posture. I won't I'll have hair on my shoulders.
4452520	4455400	I'll be sitting next to a guy in his underwear.
4455600	4457840	Nothing will be ceremonious about it.
4458040	4460280	And on top of that, I won't even be that cool and dramatic.
4460280	4461960	Only Kennedy's get to die that way.
4461960	4465800	Like most of us, you know, you get a fucking cancer in your nut one day.
4466000	4467200	It could have could have taken you.
4467200	4468240	You could have gone out like that.
4468240	4470560	Charles Schultz get cancer in his butt.
4470760	4474440	Yeah, but cancer, the cancer, you get time to say goodbye to everybody.
4474640	4478080	When you get a Goldberg, that's you don't get to say goodbye.
4478280	4480000	It's just Adam. Adam rushed the stage.
4480000	4482480	Remind me of the scene in Platoon where the sapper comes in.
4482480	4484080	He just runs into the end of the tent.
4484280	4486960	Did you know there's a guy in the first
4486960	4489200	like boom, like everything goes up like that.
4489400	4490520	Like that's that's all you get.
4490720	4492000	Yeah, that's all you get.
4492200	4494320	Adam, please don't kill us.
4494520	4495960	Thank you. We have your word.
4496000	4500480	We got a we got a we got a year long renew.
4500680	4501880	That's what that sounded like.
4502080	4505480	Yeah, it's like through the through the years, we'll all be together.
4505680	4508920	If the fates allow.
4511120	4513320	Spencer, what's your take on Christmas?
4513320	4514920	Are you a sentimental guy around the holidays?
4515120	4520280	I mean, I like the idea of it, but I'm I'm more of a grump around the holidays.
4520480	4522840	It's about unfulfilled expectations for me.
4523040	4525320	So yeah, but you get to do that.
4525360	4526040	That's fun.
4526240	4530120	Well, I get to well, no, because people are like, well,
4530320	4533520	Christmas has never been the same ever since my dad lost his leg.
4533720	4537640	And it's like, yeah, my parents got me a Hello Kitty digital camera one time.
4537840	4539440	I know how you feel.
4540880	4543120	Did they really? Yeah, yeah, it was that was.
4543320	4547400	Yeah, it would have been better if it was a digital camera that was like worth half
4547600	4550400	a crap, but if it's something you get for like fifteen dollars,
4550600	4555080	like the novelty value isn't even worth the utility, you know,
4555240	4556280	it's not even a joke.
4556480	4558720	Was that the beginning of the of the end of your like,
4558920	4564640	if you're dashed hopes around the hall? No, that was the the lash on the dead horse.
4564840	4566160	Like I was like, OK, fuck it.
4566360	4568760	I'm going to make my own happiness,
4568960	4572080	which I should have carried on the rest of my life because I only do that
4572080	4574160	for Christmas is making my only happiness.
4574160	4575440	Apparently. How do you do that now?
4575640	4581280	I just get myself the stuff I want and I tell everybody else to go fuck themselves.
4581440	4582520	Beautiful.
4582720	4586240	Make that into a Christmas song.
4586840	4589040	Spencer's man.
4589240	4591280	The beard is long.
4592040	4594000	He bought some gifts.
4594200	4596640	So say go on.
4596840	4600240	There you go. See, it's not fucking hard.
4600440	4603600	Paul, Paul, Sir, Sir Paul McCartney.
4603800	4608960	I don't respect you to be able to take your fucking knighthood away for that fucking song.
4609960	4612880	You should at least make you fight a dragon.
4613080	4617240	You should you should have OK, if you're if that's going to be because you didn't
4617440	4620440	get knighted for your ability to protect the king.
4620640	4623520	You got knighted for making for recording yesterday.
4623720	4627080	So now that you recorded that Christmas song, fight a dragon.
4627280	4629600	We'll call it even.
4629800	4632280	Well, I don't think you should be I like what you're saying,
4632280	4635720	because I think people get all victimey around the holidays and get morose
4635920	4638840	and they pretend they don't have control over what's going on.
4638920	4641520	But you can it's it's so fun just to.
4641720	4645280	Oh, I'll tell you my Christmas memory, Christmas Day.
4645480	4646920	I'm driving.
4647120	4651280	I'm by myself and I'm driving Christmas morning down.
4651480	4654000	I'm in West Hollywood driving the streets are empty.
4654200	4655960	It's so fun to drive in Christmas.
4656160	4657120	The streets are empty.
4657320	4663280	I'm driving a some kind of like you guys are not going to believe me.
4663480	4665880	And sometimes I still think was it a hallucination.
4666080	4668800	But crossing the street was a giant mushroom.
4669000	4675640	Even even we even weirder, even weirder,
4675840	4680800	crossing the street was like a little, you know,
4681000	4685960	little buggy with a goat pulling it
4686160	4690400	and a little person riding in the buggy.
4690600	4692640	I still wonder, did I dream it?
4692840	4694240	Was it? But I saw it.
4694440	4698040	I saw it quickly went across the street crossing at the crosswalk.
4698240	4699880	It was no, it wasn't a crosswalk.
4700080	4703600	It was just I was like coming down from Fairfax.
4703600	4704600	I don't know where he was going.
4704800	4706320	It was a boat and a little person.
4706520	4710400	It was a goat pulling a little buggy with a little person in it.
4710600	4714160	Was he was the little person doing this voluntarily?
4714360	4719400	Was the just a little person like clear, was a little upset about this arrangement?
4719600	4721240	No, no, they're paying the picture.
4721440	4724320	Was it was it was a little person like they have reigns?
4724520	4727960	Was he like it was fucking sinister.
4728160	4732760	It was like a merging of dimensions or something like this sort of goat,
4732960	4735200	this big, this big goat, a little little mini goat.
4735400	4738840	It was enough of a goat to pull a buggy with a dwarf in it.
4739040	4741640	But also to find buggy, because that's the other thing.
4741840	4744160	Like a little it almost looked like a baby carriage.
4744360	4745680	It was very gothy, man.
4745880	4747960	It looked like a goth baby carriage.
4748160	4748880	It was creepy.
4749080	4752080	Now I now I'm saying this and I feel like, am I lying?
4752280	4753080	Did this really happen?
4753280	4757160	I want to live in a world where this did happen.
4757280	4758520	It did happen, man.
4758720	4759640	So David Lynch.
4759840	4762120	Now, were they crossing?
4762120	4764040	Were they crossing the street from sidewalk to sidewalk?
4764040	4766160	Are they going down the street, crossing, crossing?
4766160	4769600	And did it look like they were going with purpose or what was the look on the little
4769800	4773480	person's face? Yes, they were headed to the carrot stand for sure.
4773680	4776280	He looked like the goat looked tired.
4776480	4780480	No, the look was like, you know, like when you see a squirrel that's trying to get
4780680	4785160	from tree to tree, it was like that kind of fervent and it knows it's not supposed
4785160	4787640	to get seen or something.
4787840	4790840	Are you describing the goat or the little person right now?
4791040	4793400	By every part of the question.
4793600	4794440	So they were a team.
4794640	4796440	They were a team. Yes, they were together.
4796640	4798120	This was a duo.
4798320	4802560	This wasn't a goat making away with a little person.
4802760	4805560	The goat wasn't kidnapping a little person.
4805760	4809680	A goat driven little person had found themselves in this situation where they're
4809880	4811480	like, this, no one's going to believe this.
4811680	4812680	And how do I get out of this?
4812800	4816200	Because no matter how much I wave my arms, people keep waving back.
4816400	4821720	And I have the truth is I found my way into this buggy,
4821920	4825760	this goat toad buggy, and now it looks like I'm supposed to be in it.
4825960	4827760	If you ever can't get out.
4827960	4831600	Was that was the little person dressed up as Santa Claus or anything else?
4831800	4834920	No, the little person was wearing black, black.
4835120	4836040	And this was Christmas.
4836040	4837520	What they Christmas morning.
4837720	4838960	And I thought this is some kind of like
4838960	4844320	a satanic art experiment where they know that only lonely people are driving
4844520	4848560	around on Christmas morning and if he goes by in his carriage, it'll freak him out
4848760	4853320	permanently. Now, did you did you just drive past and say,
4853320	4855800	what the hell? I think I would have pursued them.
4856000	4859360	I was so depressed that day that I was just like, of course.
4859560	4860760	Yeah.
4864520	4867440	Boy, doesn't that sum it all up.
4868160	4870880	Talk about talking about dashed expectations.
4871080	4872200	Jeez Louise.
4872400	4873680	For who? The goat?
4873880	4874960	For everybody.
4875160	4881120	No, no, I think the goat answered a Craigslist ad and was like, this is not.
4881320	4885520	I'd like to think that that was just like the world's most
4885720	4891240	funny little person, just like I'm going to make everybody's day really complicated.
4891440	4895920	My friend Billford on Fairfax one day on New Year's Day, like at noon.
4896080	4898480	So everyone's getting ready to whatever party they're going to go to.
4898480	4901560	And he's walking up Fairfax, like kind of around Cantor's
4901760	4906160	and Damiano's Pizza, and he's going up the street and he sees about two blocks up
4906360	4910080	coming down, like from where Fairfax High would be as a guy,
4910280	4913720	maybe homeless, maybe not like down on his luck for sure.
4913720	4916080	But like, you know, not not not definitely renting.
4916280	4918600	Yeah, not not not wearing a Sunday best,
4918800	4923640	but kind of a kind of a rag raggedy rag a muffin dude coming coming at him at a full
4923640	4926840	sprint from about two blocks away and Fred's a big guy.
4927040	4928520	He's like six, four, six, five.
4928520	4930040	And like he can handle himself.
4930240	4935440	But there's a guy coming down the road at a full clip and like full steam ahead out
4935640	4939720	of and there's no one else in the sidewalk and Fred's kind of bracing himself.
4939720	4941800	And the guy runs up to him and grabs him by the shoulders.
4942000	4944120	He goes, Happy New Year, man.
4944320	4946680	Only four more to go.
4948600	4950760	And then runs off.
4951560	4952720	Holy shit.
4952920	4960560	It was not 1996 or or 1998 or it didn't round up to like like my and not 98,
4960560	4962800	but I didn't round up to my own calendars or the end of them.
4963000	4966480	That's like page twenty three of of a Paul Rudd movie.
4966680	4971280	We had to spend the next he just that's how he finds out.
4971480	4974760	But then the guy just got dispensed that happy information.
4974760	4975560	Only four more to go.
4975760	4978080	He's happy like we're going to we're going to make it.
4978240	4980760	And then and then just kept going and we're more.
4980960	4982840	Traveler. Yeah.
4983040	4984640	I had a friend that used to run down the streets.
4984640	4988360	He would take a shirt off like when he'd be in foreign towns and he would take a
4988360	4989920	shirt off and just go, I'll be right back.
4990120	4991520	And he just just go charging.
4991520	4993080	And he was a giant dude as well.
4993280	4996440	And he would charge down the street and he'd grab somebody and go, what day is it?
4996440	4997440	What day is it?
4997640	4999600	And I go, what do we do today?
4999800	5000600	What day is it?
5000800	5002000	Wednesday. No, no, no, no, no.
5002200	5004080	The date, man. The date.
5004280	5006560	Because June 11 of the year.
5006760	5010600	The year that 1998.
5010800	5012440	It worked.
5013440	5017120	And then he just run down the street yelling at working his underwear.
5017320	5023760	And it seems like that's a lot of energy to put into a show for one person.
5023960	5028480	I don't know where where the payoff happens there.
5028680	5032360	Speaking of payoff, let's thank Anatoly for being our
5032600	5035320	Russian Santa Claus this evening.
5035520	5037240	But we need we need the chair now.
5037440	5040360	We got to we got to send you back into the front row
5040560	5046480	so you can prop your eggs up on the stage like, you know, like this is your home.
5051560	5052560	God damn it.
5052760	5056400	You can't you can't you can't just throw jingle bells on that piece of shit.
5056400	5058760	Fucking synthesizer and call it a Christmas song.
5058960	5060960	I want to punch everybody.
5063360	5071880	Yeah, no, it seems like a like a song that, yeah, like you would you would write
5072080	5076280	and play to make your mom say stop it.
5076480	5079920	Spencer, do you have a favorite Christmas tune holiday song?
5080120	5084440	No, I mean, they're no they're all terrible.
5084640	5089240	The concept of favorite is not logical.
5089440	5092560	Why would I choose something over another thing?
5092760	5094680	It doesn't make sense.
5094880	5097200	Well, they're all just terrible.
5097400	5098600	I mean, no way, man.
5098800	5099920	Good King wins this loss.
5100120	5101840	That's a good one. What?
5102040	5102960	Come on, man. You love it.
5103160	5104440	You love once this loss.
5104640	5106480	Have you ever heard good King wins this loss?
5106680	5107760	Oh, man. Oh, fuck it.
5107960	5114920	Vaguely. You got to get your winces loss on winces loss.
5116360	5117680	I don't get it.
5117680	5120240	Everyone's having a beverage moment.
5120440	5122880	Spencer, what are you going to tell your kids about Santa Claus?
5122880	5123760	How are you going to handle that?
5123760	5124720	I always wonder about that.
5124920	5128680	Pretty optimistic thinking of you.
5131760	5136520	OK, come on. You're nothing, if not fecund.
5136720	5139000	Then I am nothing.
5140360	5145560	There was a TV special when David Bowie and Bing Crosby fucking got it together.
5146520	5151160	Bing Crosby is being very good about it because he's like, what is the what is
5151360	5155520	this like the guy he's so weird, but Bing Crosby is just like I'm playing ball.
5155720	5157280	And this is a goodie.
5157480	5158400	You don't know.
5158600	5159520	No, everyone knows it.
5159720	5160760	Go Google it.
5160960	5162720	We're on a podcast.
5165320	5167120	Sabine goes, peace on earth.
5167320	5169760	And then he goes,
5171560	5173840	he goes with his weird tenor.
5174080	5175640	So good. What was that show?
5175640	5176920	What was the special they were on?
5177120	5179560	Bing Crosby Christmas special, right?
5179760	5180640	Star Wars.
5180840	5182040	All right.
5182240	5183880	We got we got 13.
5184080	5186760	What is it? 23 minutes.
5186960	5189160	Let's play some Christmas Dungeons and Dragons.
5189360	5191720	Let me find a Christmas Christmas.
5191920	5194040	Erin Erin can't be here.
5194040	5195120	She's sick at home.
5195120	5196000	She doesn't want to.
5196200	5196760	You know what you do.
5196760	5198120	We should we should get a gal on stage
5198120	5199520	because it's been very male heavy.
5199720	5202160	I was going to bring up Rob Schwab.
5202400	5203200	Same difference.
5203400	5205680	Rob Schwab on the stage.
5206280	5207680	What's up?
5209840	5211160	You stay here.
5211360	5213680	I was trying to bring up Schwab.
5213880	5217160	Schwab, Schwab, Schwab, Schwab, Schwab, Schwab, Schwab, Schwab, Schwab.
5217360	5221760	But yeah, just because it's Christmas and
5221960	5222800	now it's Christmas.
5223000	5223720	It's a special show.
5223920	5226360	I just wanted to end the year.
5226560	5227480	You know, hello.
5227680	5228480	I heard you out there.
5228680	5232000	I almost got killed by an SUV with you once.
5232200	5234560	I was driving with one arm too.
5234760	5235800	Like I was just I did.
5236000	5238640	I think I just went like that.
5238840	5242000	I think it was just totally like I was driving.
5242200	5245680	And you know, you know that if we were
5245880	5251080	on Melrose passing Highland, you know that that means like there's
5251280	5256720	a statistical 95% chance that we were going to some shitty ass meeting.
5256920	5259480	Like it was at night, wasn't it?
5259680	5261440	No, it was broad daylight.
5261600	5262680	Oh, OK. All right.
5262880	5267520	Like there's a good chance we weren't on our way to make entertainment history.
5267720	5269600	Right. Like we were going to hear a fucking.
5269800	5271960	That's somebody tell us we got the rights
5272160	5276320	to an article about this guy who turned a slinky into a car
5276520	5277840	and we would have died.
5278040	5283720	We could have been meeting John Lovett to go meet Bob Greenblatt
5283920	5288600	to pitch his sitcom for HBO.
5288760	5290920	Try a Christmas wish.
5291120	5292760	You have a wish for this Christmas?
5292960	5295480	Um, well, I'm going to miss you guys.
5295680	5298280	You guys are going to Scotland.
5298480	5300200	Where are you going to be? You're going somewhere else.
5300400	5306000	I'm going to San Francisco to to to hang out with the homeland.
5306200	5313240	Yes, to hang out with Kate's sister and her husband.
5313440	5316920	He smirked because he thought I was going to do some gay joke.
5317120	5319200	You said the whole land.
5319400	5323080	You said the whole I did that for you because
5323280	5327040	we're so old that it's like the world doesn't even respect that anymore.
5327240	5328840	It doesn't like
5329040	5331440	know each other twenty five years or something.
5331640	5335280	He thought I was going to go to San Francisco.
5335480	5337160	Fag.
5342160	5344640	Within the realm of possibility, you never know with me.
5344800	5346080	Yeah.
5346840	5347760	All right.
5347960	5349680	That's not really a wish, though.
5349880	5355040	I hope you guys are safe on your wish that all the snow could be balls.
5355240	5356120	All right.
5356320	5359040	All right. Spencer, I've looked at my Christmas
5359240	5362920	playlist and I've tried to find the the most spooky
5363120	5367520	Christmas song I have to give you the the intro music.
5367720	5369000	That's good. Are you ready?
5369200	5371400	Yeah, sure. Let's play some D&D.
5371600	5373040	Sorry, I'm here.
5373160	5375360	I can help Dungeon Master Quark.
5375560	5377240	What do you want to roll the dice?
5377440	5378240	I could do that.
5378440	5381440	So, Rob, you'll be Mulrain, Sedana.
5381640	5383760	That's character.
5383960	5386360	Duncan will be will be Christoper,
5386560	5390320	Kumail's character, and
5390520	5393320	is he still messed up from that last time?
5393520	5395120	Character sheets are dispensed.
5395320	5398120	Spencer, spooky Christmas.
5398320	5401840	Yeah, I don't have glasses spooky Christmas.
5402000	5403240	It doesn't matter, Rob.
5403440	5405840	It. Oh, yeah.
5408840	5412160	This is going to be great.
5412360	5414560	The dice are ruled.
5415760	5416840	The die is cast.
5417040	5418720	I fucked it up.
5418920	5419720	Yeah.
5419920	5422600	Last time on Harmon down.
5422800	5424680	Should they do it like spooky Christmas?
5424880	5427320	No, no. Can you can you structure it like Paul's lyrics?
5427640	5429680	Sharpie remembered
5429880	5435200	for the third time that he had a hawk.
5435400	5437400	He talked to Mitch Hurwitz.
5437600	5439920	I had a good time.
5440120	5441120	I guess I can't.
5441320	5443000	I guess I can't.
5444440	5447680	After pulling off dark Admiral Darkstar's
5447880	5452200	dark head, our heroes were now attacking his metallic golem.
5452400	5457040	His Sharpie attacked from the inside on what he could swear
5457040	5461480	was a heart, Moraine attempted to melt the metal monster's steel skin
5461680	5463120	with her blazing armor.
5463320	5465640	After their individual attempts failed,
5465840	5469640	the heroes outside the golem began attacking the head and unison,
5469840	5474280	sawing and cleaving at its neck in true decapitated fashion.
5474480	5476680	Meanwhile, Sharpie and Avenger cracked
5476880	5481360	wise and shrunk the glowing red heart node before diving into two holes
5481560	5484160	that were revealed to be the golem's legs.
5484360	5489520	Down there, they spied glowing stones and Sharpie shrunk one because he was on a roll
5489720	5495240	shrinking stuff and it caused the golem to shudder and the stones glow to dim.
5495440	5501120	It seemed as if it was just a matter of time until the golem was disassembled.
5501320	5503000	That's all. I don't know.
5503200	5504200	I don't know.
5510400	5511400	That's cool.
5511400	5512400	Yeah, wonderful.
5512600	5515240	So you guys know what to do now?
5515440	5518200	No, no, no, not really.
5518400	5519200	Why would they?
5519400	5521880	Especially where am I a quark located right now?
5522080	5526440	You as well as Duncan and Rob, you guys are sitting.
5526640	5530720	Imagine sitting on the shoulders of this giant robot man.
5530920	5532520	Are we still sawing his head off?
5532720	5537120	Yeah, you two are sawing at his head with a wire saw and you are hacking at it
5537320	5539080	with your sword sword.
5539080	5542160	How far away through the neck are we right now?
5542360	5545200	You know, about a third on each side.
5545400	5546840	So there's about a third left.
5547040	5548720	How big is this guy's neck?
5548920	5551000	He's been a giant and giant metal man.
5551200	5556440	I take my mighty great sword, pull it back out and give it one more big slash.
5556640	5558040	One more.
5558240	5559840	OK.
5560760	5563880	He resents your audacity.
5564080	5566360	Well, you're not Robert Redford in the natural.
5566360	5568480	You don't know that you're going to spark this scoreboard.
5568480	5573200	Dennis Frederick the Great said La Dase, La Dase, Toucheur La Dase.
5573400	5574880	Did he?
5575080	5577200	Audacious, audacious, always audacious.
5577400	5581880	I heard that Robert the OK said that and Robert the Great took that.
5582080	5584840	Wait, who did you credit that one?
5585040	5586760	Robert, Robert the Amazing.
5586960	5588360	Robert the...
5588560	5594200	So, yeah, like Robert the Amazing, you swing your sword.
5594400	5595360	Did he have one?
5595560	5597480	Whatever, move past it, Spencer.
5597720	5600240	Dealing, you're not dealing damage in this case,
5600440	5605000	but you shear the final bits of metal off this thing's head.
5605200	5608400	Its head falls off and clamps to the ground.
5608600	5610760	Merry Christmas.
5614200	5616520	The head is off.
5616720	5618960	The robots, Jess.
5619160	5621000	And that's enough.
5621200	5623520	Simply sorry.
5623720	5626240	A big robotic golem's head.
5626400	5628280	That was fun. What's in his neck?
5628480	5630360	Yeah, what's in his neck? We look in his neck.
5630560	5633120	You see a floating glowing stone.
5633320	5635800	It's glowing with a topaz light.
5636000	5639120	I yell down ironically and sarcastically to Sharpie.
5639320	5641600	It looks like it's heart.
5643920	5645040	You're down in the floor.
5645240	5646640	You should grab that topaz thing.
5646840	5648040	I scramble up.
5648240	5650200	I mean, what do I perceive?
5650400	5651320	You're in a foot.
5651520	5655520	So when the head came off, you could hear the shearing of metal and then like a
5655640	5660000	shaft of light kind of going into the into the neck hole there.
5660200	5662880	I vomit on the thing.
5663680	5664720	We sure do.
5664920	5666080	I put my fingers.
5666280	5668240	I hold his hair.
5671440	5673200	You guys are real friends.
5675400	5676920	You guys don't understand.
5677120	5679080	You guys are not there for him.
5679280	5682520	You're not there for him like I am.
5682720	5685440	How does he have to sit in the backseat?
5686480	5688640	Are you OK? Are you all right?
5688840	5696040	So does my character understand maybe if I were to go toward the light?
5696240	5697600	Sure. But I got to.
5697800	5699600	Were you vomiting into the neck hole?
5699800	5702000	Yes. OK.
5702200	5706080	Yeah. So you look up towards this light
5707240	5711000	and then you get you get vomit all splattered around you.
5711200	5712960	You guys get what's happening.
5712960	5715240	I don't know how to explain it any better.
5715240	5717560	Did Christopher just vomit all over Sharpie?
5717560	5718480	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
5718680	5720880	So Christopher can just vomit voluntarily?
5721080	5723000	No, he showed his fingers down his mouth.
5723200	5724240	Yeah. All right.
5724440	5726200	Fingers. I don't know.
5726400	5728560	No, he's the bulimic.
5728760	5730520	Well, there you go.
5730720	5733680	Now, how does what does it do to the floating thing in there?
5733680	5736040	Like, how does the vomit interact with the glow?
5736040	5737680	Oh, you were trying to hit the glowing.
5737880	5739360	Yeah, I'm trying to see if it's hot.
5739560	5740920	Well, that's wait.
5741120	5742320	What?
5743680	5744800	Just let him go with this.
5744880	5747600	This is actually a really good idea.
5747800	5750440	Like, does the vomit sizzle? How does it interact?
5750480	5751320	OK, OK.
5751520	5754080	The only way to detect temperature.
5754280	5757640	I mean, it's not the only it's it's certainly the most efficient.
5757840	5763520	People, before you answer, I start I start peeing on it.
5763720	5767320	But I'm a lady, so I have to hike up my skirt or something.
5767320	5769600	What do I do? I'll hike your skirt up for you.
5769800	5773800	I got my skirt and then I just kind of I'm standing on the shoulder
5773800	5776600	and where the head fell, I just pee off the shoulder down to where the head is.
5776600	5778080	I just start peeing on the side.
5778280	5780160	Are we seeing any steam coming up?
5780360	5783080	No. Well, you guys know what?
5783280	5785840	You guys both missed your piece.
5786040	5787840	So you wrote about our key.
5787840	5789280	I rolled it. You rolled a paycheck.
5789480	5791040	I rolled it. It's a dexterity.
5791240	5798320	But yeah, but but Krista Berg, however, does vomit directly on the surface of this
5798480	5800160	crystal.
5800360	5801760	It's not all for nothing.
5801960	5804760	It doesn't sizzle really.
5804960	5807880	It doesn't sizzle.
5808080	5812040	Am I emerging from the neck and seeing this thing?
5812040	5813480	Oh, is that was are you going to?
5813680	5815320	Yeah, you're clambering up on it.
5815520	5816720	I'd like to. Yeah, yeah.
5816920	5818080	You clamber up.
5818280	5822680	It's a bit tough because you're all slick with vomit.
5822880	5823960	But that doesn't make any sense.
5824160	5826000	I'm sorry. I don't mean to.
5826000	5828560	It doesn't seem like some trickled off the finger.
5828560	5829520	Did you puke on me?
5829720	5830520	Some drippled off.
5830720	5832920	It was floating in the middle of his neck hole.
5833120	5835080	So he puked into the neck hole.
5835280	5836760	Some of it got on this crystal.
5836760	5840080	The rest of it splired the crystal relative to the golem's body.
5840280	5842960	It's essentially floating, hovering in mid neck hole.
5843160	5844120	Mid neck hole. Yeah.
5844320	5845080	Is it within reach?
5845280	5846280	Like its brain.
5846480	5849240	I know how much you hate it when I try to get.
5849440	5851040	Well, why would the brain be in his neck hole?
5851040	5852960	Yeah, why? Well, because his head's off now.
5853160	5854200	But this thing remains.
5854440	5855840	It's floating mid neck hole.
5856040	5857320	Yeah. Mid neck hole.
5857520	5858680	Could be his Adam's apple.
5858880	5861240	Where is Adam's apple? Or down in the neck?
5861440	5863720	No, like right, right at the neck collar.
5863920	5867520	Guys, I think it's the carotid amethyst.
5867720	5868440	It's a topaz.
5868640	5870480	If I know my golem ring.
5872680	5874640	So are you up out of the neck?
5874840	5877000	Yeah, I'm up in the neck area.
5877200	5878120	You burst forth.
5878320	5880880	I'd like to touch this topaz vomit.
5881080	5882560	Right. That was your question.
5882720	5885560	The hole, the hole is about a five foot radius,
5885760	5889280	so you'd have to stretch like pretty, pretty far to reach that thing.
5889480	5893560	I extend him a hand and let him lean out so he can touch the topaz.
5893760	5895040	All right. Unless I cast.
5895240	5896000	I don't have it.
5896200	5899880	Why don't you just cast teamwork?
5901560	5902040	Fine.
5902240	5905880	It's the greatest spell of all.
5910160	5911600	Anyway, working together,
5911720	5916920	you manage to reach out and grasp this this power crystal of some sort.
5917120	5918320	You grab it.
5918520	5922400	It feels like it's being held in place with like a magnetic kind of force.
5922400	5924080	But as you grab it, it kind of goes away.
5924280	5926760	Like it won't, you know, get stuck there.
5926960	5928320	How big is this thing?
5928520	5931080	Like pretty small, like maybe the size of an eyeball.
5931120	5933360	Oh, he puked on it, but it's the size of an eyeball.
5933360	5934880	Yeah, that's why it didn't like.
5934880	5936800	Yeah, he only puked on it with a little bit of puke.
5936800	5939760	The rest of it was free to splatter on a human eyeball, right?
5939960	5941240	You shrunk it.
5941400	5946000	Different, different thing, not the heart, not the heart.
5946200	5947360	Topaz.
5947560	5953000	So is the gong moving still or is it what's doing while we do this to it?
5953200	5955320	I mean, this hasn't taken too long, I guess.
5955520	5957920	Vomiting, inducing vomiting is only a few seconds.
5958120	5958560	True.
5958760	5964440	It's been a bit momentarily stunned by by the loss of its head.
5964640	5967400	You know, it hasn't started moving
5967600	5971120	since this fuck up was Topaz, man.
5971320	5974680	Yeah, can we just grab the Topaz and throw it, throw it away?
5974880	5975640	He grabbed it.
5975840	5977880	So you grabbed it by holding onto it.
5977880	5979560	Is it like holding my weight or no?
5979760	5980800	No, that's the thing.
5981000	5985480	Oh, I got it. Yeah, you got it back in to the shoulder area.
5985680	5987280	I put it in my pocket.
5987480	5988600	OK, that happens.
5988800	5991600	You pull each other in and you pocket the thing.
5991600	5992600	Is the gong still moving?
5993240	5996920	It hasn't moved since being decapitated.
5997640	5998960	What's what's funny over here?
5999160	6000480	Nothing. Come on.
6000680	6001760	No, no, nothing, nothing.
6001960	6004280	Are you simply having a wonderful Christmas time?
6004480	6006640	Yeah, I just think it's fine.
6006840	6010320	I climbed down his back like is he wearing clothing of some sort?
6010320	6011600	Is it was skin or what's going on?
6011800	6016720	He's got like metal, metal shell wearing a ladder.
6017720	6020320	No, well, now we know.
6020520	6021400	It's a great question.
6021400	6025400	I slide down his back and grab like grab him around the waist and just kind of like
6025400	6029280	as a joke kind of look up and start kind of dry humping him from behind.
6029480	6033360	Yeah, yeah, I get I get out of it.
6033560	6038760	And so now am I in the the keep where we fought Admiral Drexler?
6038960	6042400	Am I the level right before the level you were?
6042600	6046520	Yeah, this is the level with all those bodies, I guess, all the blood buckets.
6046720	6050160	I walk over to a window and I look out of it.
6050320	6052360	You do that.
6052560	6054800	You can see just like snow and whiteness.
6055000	6056800	It's snow. Yeah.
6057000	6061400	Can I climb down and push the golem over?
6061600	6063200	Yeah. Wait, wait, wait.
6063200	6064080	I'm still up here.
6064280	6065520	Oh, I'm sorry. Come down.
6065720	6066600	Let's go down together.
6066800	6068640	OK, OK.
6068840	6070040	You walk down.
6070240	6071760	I stay on. I stay on.
6071760	6074800	I want to be on him when he goes over because I'm still fucking him.
6075000	6077360	You push one ankle, I'll push the other.
6077560	6079040	So we push over the golem.
6079240	6082000	In unison, you push the golem's ankles.
6082200	6086640	And at first it begins to creak and then totter a bit, maybe
6086840	6093560	and then topple, in fact, topple over in a pile of clanging, clanging metal.
6093760	6094680	Happens.
6094880	6095640	Happens.
6095840	6096520	OK.
6096720	6101640	I touch the frosted glass of the window I'm standing in as I look out at the fresh
6101840	6105920	new fallen snow and I think about family
6106160	6111200	and I think about a little baby born in a manger.
6113520	6118760	I start telling everybody how Christmas comes from mushrooms.
6122120	6125960	You make several cogent points.
6126560	6128360	I examine.
6129680	6133600	I examine the room for doors, other ways of egress.
6133680	6138840	The only way through this door is a large metal hatch in the floor.
6139040	6140120	I examine it.
6140320	6142960	It's large and metal.
6143160	6144480	Christopher, you're a rogue.
6144480	6147040	You're good at doors. Get over here and try to open this thing.
6147240	6153240	OK, I go over to the door and I vomit on it.
6153440	6154440	That's stupid.
6155640	6156240	I don't know why.
6156440	6160120	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait to see where he's going with this.
6160320	6161240	Does it sizzle?
6161440	6162960	No, I use.
6164240	6169000	It's the only way I know if things are hot.
6169200	6173080	I hate to come to your house, man.
6173280	6175520	You don't want me to cook for you, man.
6175720	6177920	Hey, doggone to the package.
6179280	6180200	Hey, get the door.
6180400	6182400	I think my grandmother's coming.
6183600	6185200	Let the dog out.
6185400	6188360	OK, I'm expecting a package.
6188560	6191080	No, no, I
6192080	6197400	I use what I use my thieving skills to analyze the door to make sure it's not
6197600	6202680	trapped or to see if it's a trap door and I'm certainly not trapped.
6202880	6205720	Although you're not quite sure how it opens.
6205920	6210000	There's got to be stuff you'd say when you were investigating and examining.
6210200	6213920	Oh, this door, it seems like a classic, big, heavy metal door.
6214120	6217760	It doesn't appear to be trapped as many of the doors that I've seen before.
6217960	6218960	Yeah.
6219920	6221640	I don't know. What does it say?
6221840	6223240	The door is fine, everybody.
6223440	6224760	Let's pull it up.
6224960	6226760	Let's grab it, grab that door.
6226960	6229440	So I try to pull the door up.
6229640	6231840	You try, but you fail it.
6232040	6236840	It seems like it's some sort of sliding rather than a swinging,
6237040	6239200	actuating hinge. Slide the door.
6239400	6240720	I slide the door.
6240920	6245440	You slide the door and below it, you see only lava.
6245640	6246760	I puke on it.
6246760	6249720	Yeah. It's sizzles.
6249920	6252800	Wait, you ended up... Is it hot lava? Is it hot?
6253000	6254120	Yeah, yeah, very.
6254320	6256800	OK, good. Now we know.
6257000	6258560	I told you, guys.
6258760	6261280	Puke sizzles when it's such a hard day.
6261480	6263200	I'm on your side.
6264000	6267840	So we beat Admiral Darkstar.
6268040	6269680	We beat him. We came to his place.
6269880	6272480	We kicked his ass. We're done, right?
6272480	6274520	We're walking around, we're looking through lava doors.
6274520	6277000	But the truth is, we beat this guy.
6277200	6280200	One. You want to celebrate?
6280400	6283120	Well, I'm just saying, like,
6283320	6287080	what if we just said to you three weeks later?
6287280	6290200	They were all found dead.
6290400	6292040	Let's not do that.
6292240	6293400	There's more to do.
6293600	6296320	I mean, I guess we do have to make our way out of this building.
6296520	6298120	Fine. Well, it just seems like a little...
6298320	6301320	Spencer, the only way out of this building is the lava door on the floor.
6301520	6302800	Are there any lava boats?
6302960	6304760	No, there's no lava boats.
6304960	6307800	Yeah, that's the only thing. The only other thing is a staircase,
6308000	6310240	but it goes up ways. It doesn't go down ways.
6310440	6312720	I go up the staircase and check it out. I go up.
6312920	6315760	That's that that floor where you saw Admiral Darkstar.
6315960	6321440	There's a dark pillar of black blackened crystal and a big hole in the floor where
6321640	6323080	that robot arm. Yeah.
6323280	6324480	So what else?
6324680	6326120	Are we sure Admiral Darkstar is dead?
6326320	6329520	I mean, who's sure of anything, man?
6329720	6331640	I don't think he's right. I don't think he's dead.
6331880	6335200	I think this is only one way to find out.
6340520	6342120	Is there a body?
6342320	6343880	No other. No other.
6344080	6344800	There's no windows.
6345000	6347160	Doors in this room is just stairs, windows.
6347360	6348240	Yeah, empty windows.
6348440	6349360	There's snow outside.
6349560	6350680	Yeah.
6350880	6354960	So you just can we go through the window and down into the snow and you can try.
6355160	6357480	And there's a servant laying on the floor unconscious.
6357680	6360320	No, no, there isn't.
6360560	6362360	Is there a servant on the floor lay unconscious?
6362560	6367960	I mean, I run over to a possible unconscious servant and I rouse him or her.
6368160	6371840	Wait, why do you rouse? Wait, why are you going to wake him up right away?
6372040	6373120	Let's puke on him.
6373320	6379720	Yeah, yeah, I want to I want to go over to one of these windows.
6379920	6381440	How far down is it outside?
6381640	6384120	It's several hundred feet.
6384320	6386800	How about how about how it feathered fall?
6387000	6389320	I have one hundred and fifty feet of rope.
6389480	6391040	It says on here.
6391240	6393080	So we can use the rope to climb down.
6393280	6395240	Are we trying to get out of here?
6395440	6397560	That's my instinct.
6397760	6398760	So we push.
6398960	6405040	I take the servant's unconscious body and I push him out of the window.
6405240	6406640	You don't see the servant.
6406840	6409720	There's no sir. No, there is no servant, sir.
6409920	6411680	There certainly was.
6411880	6412840	He's gone.
6413040	6415680	I mean, yeah, people move.
6415880	6417800	It's crazy.
6417960	6420000	I jump through the window and cast feather fall.
6420200	6421640	All right. That happens.
6421840	6423640	I climb down my room.
6423840	6426440	I have a hundred feet of rope and I tie it out to you.
6426640	6427160	Great.
6427360	6430560	You're the only source of casting feather fall on people.
6430760	6432720	And you're the first one out the door.
6432920	6434760	Oh, I can I can cast it on them.
6434960	6437840	The guy who builds parachutes.
6439440	6441560	I didn't know I could even cast it on other people.
6441760	6442840	Hey, that's okay.
6443040	6443880	We're good together.
6444080	6445920	Christopher, throw a sharpie the rope,
6445920	6447480	bring him back up and let's try this again.
6447680	6449080	Yeah, back to one, everybody.
6449280	6452360	Yeah. But why don't we just go down my rope?
6452560	6454280	Yeah. And then go down my rope.
6454480	6455960	It's several hundred feet.
6456160	6459240	Well, I've got one hundred and I have a hundred and fifty feet.
6459440	6460000	We tie the rope.
6460200	6464000	Let's just get Sharpie back up here, make him build us magic parachutes.
6464200	6467240	Well, I got to climb up my rope and then your rope.
6467440	6469280	We don't have enough rope to even get him back up here.
6469480	6470720	Well, he's feather falling.
6470920	6472160	He's not falling too fast.
6472360	6475480	I make a lasso and I throw it down to catch
6475640	6477480	him as he feather falls.
6477680	6479480	Are we going to swing from him falling?
6479680	6481080	Yeah. Okay.
6481280	6485440	All right. You throw him the rope and you catch the rope if you want to.
6485640	6488800	I mean, if you don't, it's like, fuck it, I'll catch it.
6489000	6490520	Thank you.
6490720	6493960	So we pull him back up because he's got a cast feather fall on us.
6494160	6496480	He feels as light as a feather.
6496680	6498800	So we pull him and pull him up back through this.
6499000	6501320	Well, I don't want to I don't want to go back up.
6501520	6504360	Come up for two seconds and you're the guy
6504440	6505720	that can get us all down.
6505920	6507080	You left us hanging out here.
6507280	6508280	Okay. Okay.
6508480	6510640	And also, guys, I turn them and say,
6510840	6514440	look, it's it's getting late and
6514640	6518520	it's Christmas time and I feel like, you know,
6518720	6521960	we don't know whether whether or not the sun will come out tomorrow.
6522160	6525760	Whether Admiral Darkstar is going to come get us as
6525960	6529120	kind of praying for some miracle that happened right now to
6529320	6530520	to end this show.
6530720	6534280	I cut Kumail's character's penis off.
6534800	6538680	Now I throw up.
6539880	6541480	Does it sizzle?
6542680	6544000	Yeah.
6546200	6547200	Yeah.
6547400	6550440	Merry Christmas, everybody.
6550640	6552120	All right, I guess that's it.
6552320	6553480	Thank you, everybody.
6553680	6555640	Merry Christmas. Happy holidays.
6555840	6557760	Happy holidays.
