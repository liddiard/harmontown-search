0	14600	Phoenix, Arizona, stand up live.
14600	17840	How are you guys doing tonight?
17840	21800	Well, I have some bloody good news for you.
21800	25600	Harman Town is in session in Arizona.
25600	32600	Won't you please help me in welcoming the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
32600	44160	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, Phoenix, yo, Phoenix, yo, Phoenix, yo, Phoenix, best city in the
44160	46040	goddamn world.
46040	47440	What's in his ear?
47440	49040	What's in his ear?
49040	51760	There's a weird thing in my ear.
51760	53280	Don't be distracted.
53280	54280	It's a camera.
54680	55840	I'm looking at you.
55840	58600	I'm taping for you for your movie.
58600	63080	You're going to be in my movie.
63080	65960	Mind games being played with you.
65960	67280	Thought you were watching me.
67280	71280	I'm watching you making movies about an audience.
76280	76880	Phoenix.
77880	88880	We have so much to talk about and barely any time to do it.
88880	89880	Thank you for waiting.
89880	94600	If you were waiting, I heard you broke the ice with, he told you, it's just your pony
94600	95600	tail.
95600	100680	We wanted to know who you were so bad.
100680	101680	What's your name?
101680	102680	Pam?
102680	103680	You're happy?
103680	105080	You're happy to be here?
105080	106080	Okay.
106080	109800	If you said no, it would take us down a whole different road.
109800	113280	In the future, if you guys are regulars here and you come to the show again and you sit
113280	117840	in that seat, just know that the people backstage get to look at the side of your head for the
117840	118840	entire time.
118840	124520	Really, one chair, like the top of your head, just like the top third of your head, depending
124520	125520	on your confidence.
125520	129840	Like every time you get a little happy, you're like, fuck no, like a whack-a-mole.
129840	133840	And we could see his, with the top of his hat right there, we couldn't tell if he was
133840	136200	a ninja, because all we could see was the back of the...
136200	137200	My back was dreadlocks.
137200	142240	I thought there'd be dreadlocks under there, but it's not, you're clearly just a regular
142240	145440	non-Jamaican meth dealer.
145440	147560	Just the surfer type, right?
147560	148760	You guys are probably sick of meth jokes.
148760	151680	I'm sure everybody that comes through goes like, hey, this is meth.
151680	153120	I'm from Wisconsin, it was cheese.
153120	157120	You guys make meth.
157120	159080	What do you wear on top of your heads at the football games?
159080	162000	Is it like a glass, like...
162000	163000	Yeah.
163640	165760	Now I'm doing it, now I'm doing it.
165760	169240	I'm doing what everyone does when they come through here, I'm sure.
169240	172040	It's the Southwest.
172040	174680	It's the best region of the country.
174680	176400	It's Phoenix, it's the greatest...
176400	181280	It's the sixth largest capital city in the United States.
181280	187160	Your mayor's name is Greg Stanton.
187160	190440	Your football team is the Sun Sanders.
191440	193160	Fuck.
193160	194160	Spent all day in the hotel room.
194160	197480	The Sun Sanders.
197480	200080	You love cacti.
200080	203080	You're proud of it.
203080	204080	So much to talk about.
204080	208440	Alright, so we're making the movie, that's where I came out with the Bluetooth.
208440	211960	We just want everywhere we go, we're making this, we got in the tour bus.
211960	215840	You're our first stop, by the way.
215840	217960	I talked to people at the bar, they didn't even know that.
217960	222120	I make the mistake of, I think that's a narcissist mistake, you think that everyone knows what
222120	223120	you know.
223120	227160	So first of all, that adds to nervousness, I think you know that I'm an asshole, I think
227160	231680	you know I'm stupid, I think you know I'm not funny, and I also think you know that
231680	236400	this is our first stop on the tour, but obviously we have to get to know each other.
236400	241320	We have been doing this show in a cradle in Los Angeles, it's like a very specific audience
241320	243560	and you guys are a specific audience.
243560	251000	We have to spend tonight making a kind of love, it will be consensual, and we're going
251000	256440	to leave here with your money having been well spent, or I will literally kill myself
256440	264120	on stage, and you'll Instagram it and use the right filter, because I feel like my blood
264120	268680	looks fat this week.
268680	273520	Also for those of you that listen to the podcast, I don't know if you listened to the last
273520	279320	one, but Pat and Oswald gave Phoenix some pretty rough treatments.
279320	288320	Did anyone hear that, did you guys, so we'll start to get to know each other, so who listens
288320	296400	to the podcast like regularly, and that's like, that's like 60% yeah, there's like,
296400	302560	so there's a lot of, okay, who just got a flyer saying you won a comedy contest, come
302560	309680	see some funny stand-up, okay, thank God, that was my big nightmare, it was like hey,
309680	315160	let's go see some comedy, and then I come out and I'm like, I feel fat, like this isn't
315160	324400	Horatio Sands, who's fat, well he's lost a lot of weight, he looks good, I'm just saying
324400	330880	like these posters on the wall, like there's people, and the people here tonight who came
330880	336040	for that, you're also going to get your money's worth, I swear to God, I swear to your God,
336040	343400	like I'm not even mine, mine's more easygoing than yours, I will do whatever your God requires,
343400	349160	you're not leaving here until your money has been well spent, how much were the tickets?
349160	356560	22, that's rough, that's a tall order for a guy like me.
356800	359920	22, that's an arbitrarily non-round number.
360720	365520	I've never done a $22 show, this will be my first one, I'm gonna, okay, fine.
365520	368480	Tonight Dan, we're gonna give you, let's give him a $23 show.
370240	372560	This will help the $22, I was like pandering to your...
375280	380560	What Dan is doing for the podcast, he's taking off, he's unbuttoning his shirt, it's not an Arizona
380560	387920	state shirt, it's the Alice Cooper Cooper's Town knockoff of the Sun Devil shirt.
389040	392720	So we have Wildcat fans who are also like big Ted Nugent fans as well.
395840	398880	Wait, are you guys mad at Sun Devils or Alice Cooper?
402720	406240	But what about, didn't you just tell me that Ted Nugent compared
406240	409680	gun owners to Rosa Parks today? Yeah, I just read that.
410880	414000	Ted Nugent like made the brave odd choice too.
414000	418640	He said, I just saw like a little blurb, apparently he said that gun owners are
418640	423840	compared them to Rosa Parks and that one day the law abiding gun owner will be sitting in the front
423840	430080	of the bus, whatever that bus is, like I'm assuming it's a bus to go rob a bank.
430080	435280	Sounds like the bus is shooting people, I don't know how that metaphor is supposed to be explored.
435280	438640	I don't know why we're sitting in the back of it now, which means we're not
438640	443040	shooting people with the guns that we're heroes for having.
443040	448080	I don't turn to Ted Nugent for my metaphors, I don't think of him as somebody...
449200	452960	I don't know why we've begun turning to him for our politics, it's the weirdest.
453920	457040	I trust him for one topic alone, bow hunting, that's it.
458160	461840	Ted Nugent knows everything about bow hunting, if he came up here and was like,
461840	466320	this is how you notch an arrow, I would go, I believe you.
466320	472560	I would go to him not for civil rights analogies, I would go to him more if I had questions about
472560	477360	wang bang sweet poontang, that's when I would turn to Ted Nugent.
479600	482240	Holy shit, what a great city, Phoenix is amazing.
485520	488400	You're already starting to sense that I'm forcing that.
488720	493360	I would say I really mean it, but I can't yet.
493360	494800	You were nervous about tonight.
494800	499200	Well, yeah, because we left our comfort zone, we drove in a bus and then we came out the door
499200	504320	and we came in here and I saw the lacquered tables and the three foot high stage and the
506320	511680	posters of people who clearly you can tell from the photos on the wall that the people
511680	517760	who normally perform here, they have actual material, they're doing it in the picture,
518080	523360	there's a picture of a lady going like, she's in the middle, she's just finishing explaining
524800	526960	what Jack Nicholson would be like in a drive through.
528400	536080	That guy finally drew the line between men and women in the shopping with the toilet.
538480	540560	This is like there's a hall of fame back there.
541920	545920	Most comics come up and riff the sets, like a hack comic would come up and go,
545920	547600	oh wow, nice to be back in Prescott.
549680	552640	But you're actually riffing the other comics that are on the wall here.
553840	555120	You're riffing on comics.
555120	557760	I'm intimidated by them, they look like the-
557760	559680	I can't tell anybody, is that Gallagher or a woman?
561440	563840	It looks like Rachel Dratch or like an emo.
565520	566320	Oh, it's Bobby Lee.
568240	569120	That's Bobby Lee.
569120	571280	Bobby Lee, if you're listening, I thought you were Rachel Dratch.
571280	575600	And Bobby Lee, I thought you were Gallagher.
577440	581200	And everyone else on the wall here, take it easy on the appetizers.
582640	583760	That's mean.
583760	585360	Look at me, look at me.
585360	589840	There is a thing, I was looking through the menu, there's a thing on the menu that just says pig.
590720	596240	And it boasts that it's, somebody grab a menu and read the pig for me on microphone.
597040	597920	Is there a menu out there?
598640	603600	A half pound of bacon with a side of maple syrup.
604320	605680	That's fucking fantastic.
606480	607680	He said a pound.
607680	608480	It's a half pound.
608480	609920	Yeah, take it easy.
611840	613040	What do you think this is?
613040	613680	Ladies night?
614400	615280	I don't know what that means.
616640	617920	Are you saying women are pigs then?
617920	618960	Is that what that was?
618960	620320	I don't know what it means.
620320	622800	I will say things, I don't know what they mean.
622800	624960	I just hope it makes you laugh.
624960	626320	It's a trick people can perform.
627120	631120	Kind of like a Rubik's Cube and a Monica Lewinsky cigar.
632160	632800	No, it didn't work.
632800	633280	Okay, good.
634320	635600	Don't ever let me fool you.
636960	637760	Rap, rap.
637760	639520	Oh, shit, you want to rap?
639520	642720	All right now, see now, Dan, I don't know if you guys are familiar with this.
644560	645440	Dan likes to rap.
646320	648880	The raps usually involve him fucking one of your mothers.
651200	651680	We have a...
653680	655360	Who wants me to rap about fucking their mom?
656400	657680	All right, I got a lot of hands.
657680	658400	I love Phoenix.
658400	658640	You're what?
659440	660000	Your aunt?
660560	661120	I'm going to go with...
661120	662960	Wait, this guy wants you to fuck his aunt.
663760	664480	Fuck his house?
664480	665520	His aunt.
665520	666720	His aunt.
666720	667440	Aunt?
667440	668000	All right, all right.
668000	669680	You want Dan Harmon to rap about fucking your aunt?
670560	671120	One of those.
672000	672640	All right.
672640	673520	All right.
673520	674880	Well, shit, I'm torn.
674880	679360	Now Dan, we have a lot of different rap styles here we can use here.
679360	682000	We have sexy and slow freestyle.
682000	685760	I want to do a sexy slow rap about fucking his aunt, okay.
687280	689120	Who is a sister of his mama?
689120	690800	So maybe you can tie that in.
690800	692400	You're already burning up my rhyme, sorry.
694240	695680	Wait, what's your name, sir?
696400	697040	Alex?
697040	698240	Okay, what's your aunt's name?
698960	699600	Patty?
699600	701520	And what is she the most afraid of?
703200	703680	Aging?
704320	705040	How old is she?
707440	708640	I forgot her name already.
708640	709280	Patty.
709280	710000	Patty.
710000	710960	I'm not good at this.
712000	713520	I'm not good at this.
713520	715200	I'm good at fucking your mama.
715920	716560	I fuck.
716560	717120	Oh, shit.
722080	722640	Sorry.
722640	724400	Maybe that's how you met his aunt.
724400	724880	Right.
727360	731760	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
731760	734400	Alex came over wanted to talk to me.
734400	736400	I said, can I fuck your mama?
736400	737600	He said, let's wait and see.
737600	740800	He took me down the hall into a different room.
740800	744560	He said, the pussy you're gonna fuck is not connected to womb.
745360	750000	Yes, it is, but not the one that gave birth to me.
751360	753600	He introduced me to a different person.
754480	756880	I was, my eyes were bursting.
757520	758800	I took this bitch in.
758800	760000	I said, who are you?
760000	763280	She said, my name is Patty and I wanna fuck you.
763280	764800	I said, oh, shit.
765440	769440	Alex's aunt, I wanna fuck her out of her pant.
770400	772960	She had one pant, not a pair.
773520	774560	I fucked his aunt.
775200	777680	You didn't care, but check it out.
777680	781360	I've turned her over and said, holy shit.
781360	782720	Phoenix is a great city.
785520	786000	It's hot.
786000	787760	I can't fucking aunt.
787760	788240	It's hard.
788960	789920	It's too hot.
789920	791600	Do you wanna fuck somebody's mama instead?
791600	792800	Yeah, let's fuck this guy's mama.
796000	796800	What's your name, sir?
797680	798400	Justin.
798400	801200	You would like Dan Hermer to fuck your mama right now.
801200	801520	Okay.
801520	802480	What's your favorite food?
802640	804640	Steak.
804640	805520	Okay, steak.
805520	805840	All right.
807840	810000	Which movie did you think was better?
810000	813680	Tremors or Shawshank Redemption?
814640	815440	Shawshank Redemption.
815440	815680	Okay.
815680	816560	He likes steak.
816560	817280	What was his name?
818080	818560	Dustin.
818560	818960	Dustin.
818960	819760	Dustin.
819760	820320	Okay.
820320	820640	All right.
820640	821200	Dustin.
821200	824160	Dustin likes Shawshank Redemption and steak.
824160	825120	And I fucked his mama.
825120	825760	Give me a beat.
829360	830560	Ladies and gentlemen,
830560	836880	Dustin's mama has been fucked at least once that we know of.
838800	841360	But she's about to get it again.
852240	853120	I'm everywhere.
853120	857200	Breakdown, four in the afternoon.
857200	859280	Fuck Justin's mama all the way into...
862880	863360	The moon.
863920	864480	Retake.
864480	864960	Retake.
865760	866880	Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan.
866880	867600	That was my fault.
867600	869040	I meant to give you this one.
872640	872880	All right.
872880	873360	This one's...
876720	877220	Yeah.
877220	882500	I'm gonna fuck Dustin's mama tonight.
885380	888740	Dustin's mama because he tastes like steak.
891540	897140	It's ironic because her son loves it and so do I.
899620	902660	The weird thing is if I was next to him,
902660	906100	which I would never want to be very uncomfortable.
907140	911140	Given the naked company, I'd look over to him and say,
911140	912500	this is steak.
912500	915540	And he'd say, that's my favorite food.
916820	918820	But you're talking about my mama's pussy.
920740	922820	At that point, it's sinking what I'd done.
923540	925620	And I'd be like, sorry.
926900	927860	So sorry.
929860	931540	I've gone too far.
932500	937140	Dustin, let's go watch Shawshank Redemption.
938100	942100	I thought it was pretty masterful how I used suggestions to create a...
943540	945300	You didn't know how those were gonna come in.
945300	946580	That was experimental.
946580	948580	All right. Let's stop with the...
948580	949780	Let's stop with the gimmicks.
951220	951860	What am I?
951860	952900	What am I?
952900	954020	Performing monkey?
954740	955140	What am I?
955140	956900	Someone you paid $22 to see?
958100	960820	We have to get a couple of things out of the way just for the movie.
960820	963380	I'll take it off of your $22 if you see me after.
964340	965380	I helped you with the movie.
965380	966580	I want my $3.
968660	969860	We got to get a couple of...
969860	970900	Because we're making this movie.
970900	972020	It's like a tour movie.
973940	981380	One thing I can think that we definitely need is the slow motion montage of me killing it
981380	982340	at every venue.
982340	984980	And we definitely have to fake that.
986420	988500	Because it's not gonna happen.
988500	991700	Because I don't have Bobby Lee's chutzpah.
994420	996260	That horrible song about Dustin's mom.
996260	997300	I'm so sorry.
998180	999460	I don't know what I thought I was doing.
1000820	1001700	It didn't rhyme.
1001700	1002660	And it was gross.
1002660	1004660	And it evoked an image of...
1004660	1005460	This is gross.
1006820	1008340	I lost a lot of the women, too.
1008340	1008900	And I'm sorry.
1009540	1011620	You want to try a country song instead?
1011620	1012340	Maybe in a second.
1012340	1013060	This is like...
1014500	1015780	We don't want to burn up all the gold.
1019380	1020580	We're safe so far.
1021860	1024180	Well, let's just get a quick...
1024900	1026340	I just want to get a shot of like...
1027860	1028820	It's slow motion.
1028820	1031700	So I don't know if there's cameras that can overcrank.
1031700	1034820	So I just need you guys to be slow-mo.
1034820	1039300	So if you can like kind of just imagine that I did well.
1039300	1041780	Wait, this sounds like the most dishonest thing in the world.
1043060	1043860	No, no, it's...
1043860	1047300	Dan, Harmontown is about being sincere and honest connections with people.
1047300	1049540	Well, it's basically a real thing, but just...
1050900	1052820	Just imagine that it's the end of the show.
1052820	1055540	And like I did really good and just like kind of go...
1055540	1058180	Kind of like slow-mo like reach for me.
1058180	1059620	Like you wish you could touch me.
1060500	1063460	And then I'll be like kind of like touching you.
1063460	1065380	But first I want to get the banjobi sweep.
1066980	1070660	So you guys could just like just kind of raise up.
1070660	1072100	Like one, two, three, do it.
1072100	1073380	Like slow-mo.
1077300	1084820	This is all a lie.
1094100	1095940	What kind of movie do you think you're making?
1097940	1098900	Movie of lies.
1103860	1105300	I won't sign off on this, Dan.
1105300	1105860	This is the...
1107940	1108420	All right.
1108420	1109140	Well, whatever.
1110580	1110820	All right.
1110820	1112100	Well, can we also...
1115060	1116020	Give yourselves a hand.
1117540	1120180	Well, we'll counteract it then.
1121380	1122260	I say now, Dan.
1122260	1126020	Now, because of that dishonesty that now it's your...
1126020	1129540	The onus is on you to create that moment for real by the end of this show.
1129540	1130660	I would definitely will.
1130660	1131060	Yeah.
1131060	1135460	I basically already did like with community.
1142660	1142900	See?
1144820	1150900	But when I don't have Joel McHale again on camera, I have to juice it a little bit.
1150900	1152020	There's everything.
1152020	1153540	Everything in entertainment is a lie.
1153540	1153780	Okay.
1153780	1155860	Well, here, I'll do you this favor.
1155860	1157620	Let's do the opposite.
1158340	1160580	Like let's do the dark moment.
1160900	1162820	This might be the worst gig of the whole tour.
1162820	1165300	So does anybody have...
1165300	1168180	Do you have stuff you could throw at me without hurting me?
1170340	1172660	A lot of people have very readily picked up bottles.
1174100	1175140	But nothing glass.
1175140	1175700	Nothing that will break.
1175700	1175700	
1175700	1176260	It's a plastic.
1177460	1177780	Okay.
1178500	1180660	That looked like a roll of like sweet tarts.
1180660	1181700	Well, don't wait.
1181700	1182260	Don't start.
1184020	1185300	There has to be control.
1186340	1186980	You can't just...
1187780	1188900	Like I'll cue you.
1188980	1189380	And then we...
1189380	1190580	Because we have to get a good shot.
1192100	1192260	So...
1193940	1194340	All right.
1194340	1194900	So just...
1194900	1195620	Okay.
1195620	1198340	So I'm going to cower because I kind of like...
1198340	1202420	I reached too hard and you turned on me.
1202420	1203860	And just kind of like...
1203860	1206980	Just kind of boomy and if you don't have anything to throw,
1206980	1211620	just kind of like point angrily or go like this.
1211620	1213620	Like forget this.
1214740	1215380	So all right.
1215380	1218340	So I'll just cue you with like a generic thing.
1219300	1222100	So you'll receive the cue.
1222100	1223300	I'll cue you naturally.
1223300	1226660	Like this has been the greatest tour ever.
1227780	1231380	This thing's been better than 9-11, which I loved happening.
1231380	1232020	I loved it.
1232660	1233380	I loved it.
1234020	1236420	What are you talking about, you dumb shit?
1236420	1236980	No.
1236980	1238660	You don't know what you're talking about.
1239220	1239780	Fuck you.
1239780	1241620	I'm going back to Los Angeles.
1243460	1244740	You're sons of bitches.
1245540	1245860	All right.
1245860	1246100	There.
1246100	1246580	Are you happy?
1246580	1246980	That was good.
1246980	1247700	You guys are wrapped.
1247700	1248340	Thank you very much.
1253460	1255620	It's exhilarating to be part of Hollywood, isn't it?
1255620	1256820	Like show business.
1257620	1258340	Oh, probably.
1259700	1260260	It's a lot of...
1265060	1266020	It's a very nice crowd.
1266020	1267380	There's a lot of soft stuff.
1268340	1271620	You'd expect one guy and there'd be like a weird ninja star.
1273060	1273460	All right.
1273460	1276260	So Phoenix, let's get back to getting to know you.
1276260	1277060	And then...
1277220	1279540	Because we can't leave this town as we go on this tour.
1279540	1282580	We want to come away with learning something about this town.
1282580	1285140	I've been to Phoenix a couple of times and it's always been very quick.
1285140	1286500	So I don't really know much about it.
1286500	1288340	So we have tonight.
1288340	1290340	I know incredibly little about Phoenix.
1292100	1296340	Maybe we could solicit somebody's help learning about it.
1296340	1298020	Who feels like they know...
1298020	1299780	Who's lived here their whole life?
1301540	1301700	Okay.
1301700	1302900	We got a couple of hands.
1302900	1303620	Is that her right here?
1303940	1304740	Pam's friend.
1305780	1307220	No, sitting across from Pam.
1310980	1312260	You're both named Brianne.
1313460	1314580	That's fine, doesn't it?
1316180	1317300	You're both named Brianne.
1319540	1320260	It's weird for me.
1322100	1323300	Have you met before tonight?
1324180	1326100	You just met and you're both named Brianne.
1326100	1327060	That's awesome.
1327060	1327700	You guys are gonna...
1334500	1335300	All right.
1335940	1337380	We made a love connection over here.
1338100	1338580	All right.
1338580	1341540	Well, Brianne, would you be willing to come up and talk to us for just a second?
1341540	1343540	We don't bully people at Harman Town.
1343540	1345220	We're not gonna make fun of you.
1345220	1346900	Let's welcome Brianne to the stage, everybody.
1348340	1349460	Well, they're both Brianne.
1354580	1355380	All right, Brianne.
1358900	1360580	I have no idea what we're doing with them.
1360580	1362420	I know.
1364580	1371060	I will have you.
1374500	1376260	I would like to learn more about Phoenix.
1377380	1379380	Both of you lived in Phoenix your whole lives?
1379380	1379780	Yes.
1379780	1380100	Okay.
1383060	1384260	And you just met tonight.
1385140	1385860	It's so weird.
1387620	1388100	All right.
1388100	1391780	So what's the worst thing about Phoenix?
1394020	1394500	Summer.
1395380	1395860	What'd you say?
1395860	1396820	Summer.
1396820	1397300	Summer.
1397300	1398420	Oh, because it gets hot.
1398420	1399460	It's a dry heat, Jeff.
1405060	1405860	Do some research.
1409380	1410740	What's the best thing?
1410740	1410980	Is there...
1411780	1415460	Are you proud to be citizens of Phoenix, Arizona?
1416500	1416980	Phoenicians.
1416980	1420420	I love that you guys are like an ancient civilization here.
1420420	1421220	Yeah, that is cool.
1421460	1423780	Are you guys about to invade the Carthaginians at some point?
1423780	1424820	I love that.
1425540	1426100	I don't know.
1426100	1430100	Personally, I think for me, because I'm a musician,
1430100	1433220	I think we have a really good local scene for music.
1433220	1433780	What do you play?
1434420	1434980	A guitar.
1434980	1435460	You do?
1435460	1435780	Yeah.
1435780	1436660	Have you got a guitar here?
1437220	1437940	No.
1437940	1438900	Is there guitar in the house?
1439620	1440500	What kind of music do you play?
1441940	1443700	It varies, but mostly rock.
1443700	1444180	Do you sing?
1448580	1449220	Kind of.
1449220	1449780	You do.
1449780	1450580	I could, I guess.
1451860	1457860	Wait, do you think that if I were to improvise one of my incredible
1459540	1463220	raps, that you could do like the Rihanna or Dido hook,
1465140	1469220	like when I queued you, like you could say like,
1471460	1473700	a please come down to harm in town.
1477380	1479220	Turn your frown upside down.
1480180	1480660	You want me to stop?
1480660	1482820	P is yellow, poop is brown.
1482820	1484580	I'm going down to harm in town.
1484580	1485300	Can you remember that?
1488420	1488900	Okay.
1492260	1494740	Please come down to harm in town.
1495300	1497300	Don't, wait, I already forgot it.
1498260	1500660	Please come down to harm in town.
1502100	1505140	I forgot, I thought you were going to let her sing it.
1505140	1507540	Yeah, I was trying to get her to remember the thing.
1509700	1511140	Is that somebody that smiles?
1511140	1513220	Yeah, you turn your frown upside down.
1513220	1514580	P is yellow, poop is brown.
1515300	1516660	Come on down to harm in town.
1517780	1518660	Come on down.
1519940	1526660	Do you think he can, do you think he can come on down to harm in town?
1526660	1529620	Turn your frown upside down.
1529620	1532100	P is yellow, poop is brown.
1532980	1534980	Come on down to harm in town.
1534980	1535860	And then you would rap.
1535860	1536180	Yeah.
1536180	1536660	Okay.
1536660	1537620	Yeah, Brianna, you ready?
1537620	1538180	Yeah.
1538180	1538980	Yeah.
1539060	1541060	Yo, yo, yo.
1541060	1543460	Got off the bus about six o'clock.
1543460	1545220	I think the city's so good.
1545220	1547060	I'd like to suck its cock.
1547060	1548580	I like Phoenix.
1548580	1550020	I like my penis.
1550020	1554820	I like to swear I'm not Enos from Dukes of Hazzard.
1556020	1557140	It predates you.
1558180	1559060	Don't worry about it.
1560580	1563140	My name is Dan Harmon.
1563140	1564820	I'm here to entertain you.
1564820	1565700	Brianna.
1565700	1568100	Come on down to harm in town.
1569060	1570980	Turn your frown upside down.
1571700	1574580	P is yellow, poop is brown.
1574580	1577300	Come on down to harm in town.
1577300	1580020	Yo, situation's changing.
1580020	1582980	I don't want to go around rearranging.
1582980	1586020	I've got Brianna on my side in Phoenix.
1586020	1589060	The only thing that ever rhymes with it is penis.
1589060	1590580	But I'm going to fix that.
1590580	1592260	I'm going to do different.
1592260	1595540	But I'm not going to come up with anything different.
1596980	1598260	The rhymes are different.
1598260	1600980	I'm a bad rapper, but I'm going to make a difference.
1601700	1604180	Come on down to harm in town.
1604180	1604660	Yo.
1604660	1607140	Turn that frown upside down.
1607140	1607620	Yo.
1607620	1610180	P is yellow, poop is brown.
1610180	1610660	Yo.
1610660	1613380	Come on down to harm in town.
1613380	1616100	Everything is spinning around me like roulette wheels.
1616100	1619140	I want to touch your mama's titties and give her feels.
1619140	1621460	I want to slide my hand up her ass, crack.
1621460	1625060	I want to go up in front of her and come back around the back.
1625060	1628100	I want to drive her down to the store by her hand.
1628100	1630900	I want to fuck your mama like a fuck pimp.
1631620	1632500	Sorry about that.
1632500	1634020	I'm so sorry about that.
1634020	1635140	I'm so sorry.
1635140	1636820	I'm so, so sorry about it.
1637620	1640580	Come on down to harm in town.
1640580	1643620	Turn that frown upside down.
1643620	1646180	P is yellow, poop is brown.
1646180	1648020	Motherfucker, come on down.
1648020	1649620	One more time, everybody.
1649620	1652180	Come on down to harm in town.
1652180	1652660	Yo.
1652660	1655140	Turn that frown upside down.
1655140	1655620	No more.
1655620	1656100	Yeah.
1656100	1658100	Yo, poop is brown.
1658100	1658660	Struggle.
1658660	1661220	Come on down to harm in town.
1661220	1661860	Yeah.
1661860	1664020	I want to struggle with my insides.
1664020	1665540	I fucked your mama so hard.
1665540	1667060	I made her twice as wide.
1667060	1670020	I ordered two pounds of ham with maple syrup.
1670020	1674020	I went to Phoenix and that was all I, damn it, I fucking suck.
1676020	1678100	Jeff, you're going to do a verse, do a verse.
1678100	1679540	Fucking suck tonight.
1679540	1684900	Phoenix, Arizona, I'd like to lease you or maybe own you.
1685460	1687620	I want to date you for a while.
1687620	1690980	I'll fuck your frown into a smile.
1690980	1694180	I'll put my dick into your nose until it turns into an ear.
1694180	1696820	I'll fuck your head until it turns into your rear.
1697940	1700020	Yo, I want to unravel.
1700020	1702900	I like the way your front yards are sometimes made of gravel.
1703700	1704180	Yeah.
1704180	1704420	Yeah.
1707700	1710420	Yo, this song goes out to Rosa Parks.
1715780	1716280	Yeah.
1717300	1717780	All right.
1717780	1718660	Is that it?
1718660	1719140	What?
1719140	1719620	Breanna?
1719620	1720100	Breanna.
1720100	1720900	She's got to close it.
1720900	1721940	She's got to close it.
1721940	1722340	All right.
1722900	1724500	Wait, let me set you up.
1724500	1725300	I got to rap more.
1726980	1732580	I came to Phoenix with a fear in my heart, but now I realize all I got to do is lay a fart
1733380	1734900	because they're good people.
1736020	1738740	They're very forgiving of a very untalented person.
1738740	1741300	Yo, Dan, you were afraid of all the people that you see,
1741300	1744420	but it turns out that woman over there was actually Bobby Lee.
1745860	1751540	Yo, I thought he was Rachel Dratch, but Phoenix has unlocked my heart from the latch.
1751540	1753540	Stupid, stupid ass rhymes.
1753540	1755620	Don't try to think ahead.
1755620	1757460	Sucks all the time.
1757460	1757940	I'm fat.
1757940	1759940	I got fired by NBC.
1759940	1762740	Now I'm here and I'm rapping for you and me.
1763700	1766740	Come on down to Harlan Town.
1766740	1769300	Turn your frown upside down.
1769940	1772900	P is yellow, poop is brown.
1772900	1776100	Come on down to Harlan Town.
1776100	1778020	Yeah, Brianna.
1779940	1781220	Let's hear it for the Brians.
1783380	1783860	That was good.
1791860	1793300	Harlan Town t-shirts.
1793300	1796100	Harlan Town t-shirts available out front.
1796100	1796900	Thank you, McGathey.
1798020	1800260	Still haven't learned that much about Phoenix.
1800980	1804580	No, that summer is bad.
1804580	1805700	And what was good about it?
1805700	1806500	Oh, the music scene.
1806500	1808020	You like the music scene.
1808020	1810180	Wish we had a guitar so Brianna could play something for us.
1811220	1814740	I wish that we could just find somebody to do every part of the show.
1814740	1818340	It was like, there'd be like a guy in the front that's got a funny hat.
1818340	1819460	I do comedy.
1820500	1822180	Well, you keep getting nowhere.
1822180	1823380	He's like, oh shit, Bobby Lee's here.
1823380	1823940	Let's bring him up.
1825940	1828180	I feel, you know, it's insecure.
1828180	1829780	It's when you go on a tour, it's hard.
1829780	1831060	You leave your comfort zone.
1831060	1833380	$22, it's tough.
1833380	1836020	How about those Gator Sanders?
1836020	1836520	No.
1839300	1841460	Sun Devils, Sun Valley.
1842020	1843860	They call you the Sun Valley.
1843860	1845620	Are there Wildcat fans out there instead?
1845620	1846180	Is that the thing?
1849380	1851460	American Express corporate headquarters.
1853860	1854340	Yeah.
1854340	1855060	Yeah.
1856340	1857060	U-Haul.
1860820	1861700	Wikipedia.
1863540	1864580	I learned it.
1864580	1865300	Where are we going next?
1865300	1866180	We're going to Austin.
1866180	1867540	We're going to Austin, Texas.
1867540	1868420	What do we, what do we do?
1868420	1871060	As soon as the show is over, we have to get right in the bus and drive.
1871060	1873780	I would do that anyway, because I hate myself.
1875060	1876100	I wouldn't, I wouldn't hang out.
1876100	1880500	I would run to the bus and count their delicious money.
1881460	1885060	Now Dan, Dan, whatever happens tonight, Phoenix,
1885060	1889380	Arizona is the city where you discovered that P is yellow and poop is brown.
1890740	1892580	It took a lot of doing, but we figured it out.
1896180	1896660	Okay.
1896660	1900660	So we have to figure one thing out as we go from city to city,
1900660	1902580	because I want to start a colony on the moon.
1902580	1906340	You know, we're going to, the end times are coming for real.
1906340	1908740	Now that 2012 is over, we can really say that.
1909300	1912420	It was, it was hype before, but I'm really convinced now.
1912420	1913460	We're going to just get out of here.
1916020	1918500	And I want to, I want to create like a system of rules
1919620	1922900	when we get there so that we can have a simple society.
1922900	1925460	And I want it to be based on as few rules as possible.
1926980	1928740	And I think the first rule should be that,
1928740	1933700	that nobody should ever do anything that anyone else doesn't want them to do.
1935460	1937860	But then it gets really complicated.
1937860	1941300	So I like, like, I'm trying to figure out how to,
1942020	1944580	how to create like a constitution for harm and town.
1946820	1948820	And I need help doing that.
1950980	1955460	So I want somebody to tell me like, like, like, like, like, I'm going to close my eyes.
1957300	1959620	Who, who, that's all, that's all leave.
1961380	1962180	I would notice.
1964820	1966900	Who, who, who had the worst day today?
1966980	1970340	Who's, who's here in spite of having like the worst, worst day?
1970340	1971700	Who thinks they had the worst day?
1973140	1974500	Would you be willing to come up here?
1976020	1979380	Can you, would you, would you, we definitely, we don't pick on you.
1979380	1981460	Obviously I'm the, I'm the, I am the enemy.
1983060	1984180	You're a hero for coming up.
1985860	1988020	What's your name, sir? Ben?
1988420	2000260	All right, what'd you, okay, here, I'll give you this one.
2000260	2004340	Yeah, sit next to him.
2004340	2005300	Make it, make it, make it cute.
2005300	2006180	Make it romantic.
2006180	2006980	Okay.
2006980	2008980	You'd be like, you'd be like the two Briens.
2012580	2013780	Chords are getting tangled.
2016420	2017460	Streams are crossed.
2018740	2023060	Uh, I'm sorry about that, that song about Justin's mom and the,
2024500	2028660	I'm really nervous coming here and I made a lot of mistakes tonight.
2031540	2034900	But I could tell immediately when you said you played Scrabble all day that
2034900	2037220	that was, that was my kind of bad day.
2039380	2043140	I mean, yeah, I, the best word I played was a cat.
2043140	2047060	Like I really, oh, so it wasn't the fact that you played Scrabble all day.
2047140	2048420	It was the fact that you did badly at it.
2048980	2051540	Well, yeah, that's my, I play Scrabble every day.
2051540	2056260	Oh, so a good day would be like, if you get a cue on the triple words.
2056260	2059060	Yeah, if you play quinoa.
2059860	2060820	Right.
2060820	2063140	Is this Scramble with friends by any chance?
2063140	2068820	No, it's online with strangers and, you know, we say GG and how are you?
2068820	2074260	And occasionally you get the guy that's like, you know, you want to go have sex somewhere.
2075140	2078100	Wait, that happens in online Scrabble games.
2078100	2079540	Like somebody uses that as well.
2079540	2082580	People will be talking about sex while you're there and you're just watching.
2082580	2084020	And you have to say like, could you stop?
2088020	2088980	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
2089700	2090580	What's the URL?
2092820	2093940	It's on pogo.com.
2095060	2096260	I'm blown away by this.
2096980	2098500	The people will use that as a medium.
2098500	2099380	There's, yeah.
2099380	2100020	Oh, there's rooms.
2100020	2102020	There's rooms where you go in and it's like Mrs.
2102020	2104820	Netiquette's nightmare and it's uncensored chat.
2104820	2106340	And you go in and people can.
2107380	2109140	But they're playing Scrabble.
2109140	2110900	You're playing Scrabble, right?
2110900	2114260	And you'll put words that are suggestive, like sexy.
2118180	2121300	What if they don't have the right letters and they end up with a pickle in their ass,
2121300	2122340	even though they didn't want it.
2122340	2125780	Like, I want, I wish it's a tickle, but.
2125780	2132100	I have so many questions, but we'd be here all night.
2132980	2134820	I don't care if it takes all fucking night.
2136020	2138260	We're not going to Austin until we get to the bottom of this.
2139940	2142340	So you get in a place called pogo.com.
2142340	2142900	Pogo.com.
2142900	2147540	They have different rooms for a, it's literally Scrabble or a Scrabble type game.
2147540	2148100	It's Scrabble.
2149540	2152660	But it's understood that the different rooms, so as a,
2152660	2154100	Scrabble isn't endorsing this.
2154100	2157300	Parker Bradley or whatever the hell, they're not going, hey,
2157300	2162580	here's a room for the transgenders and here's the room for the fem doms and the flim flams.
2163780	2168500	Scrabble's just assuming that you're supposed to be getting together at Scrabble games.
2168500	2170580	But people have co-opted that culture,
2170580	2173140	turned it into a yet another way to fuck each other,
2173940	2176100	which is both uplifting and horrifying.
2180020	2180740	Yeah, okay.
2181380	2182980	A guy yelled out Minecraft is next.
2183700	2186820	I'm in the uncomfortable position of having to repeat everything that everyone yells out
2187460	2189220	because the mics won't pick them up.
2189220	2193540	But okay, so and your bad day was because you got a low score.
2194180	2198100	Yeah, I never broke 200, which is, in Scrabble, it's not very good.
2198100	2200740	Now, do you go there to play Scrabble or to meet people?
2201540	2204820	I go to, I play Scrabble, I play Battleship.
2204820	2205620	Answer the question.
2207540	2209060	I go there to play Scrabble.
2209060	2210340	Okay, so you're a Scrabble fan.
2210820	2211460	Yes.
2211460	2214020	And meanwhile, there's people just fucking and sucking on there.
2215300	2216260	Yeah, right.
2216260	2218180	And it's hard not to respond to these people.
2221300	2222100	What's your name again?
2222820	2223220	Ben.
2223220	2223720	Ben.
2224260	2225220	Follow your heart, Ben.
2230020	2234740	On a good day, someone would offer to blow you and you'd beat them at Scrabble.
2234740	2236260	Yeah, and I would say, suck it.
2236260	2237940	So today was a bad year, suck it.
2238820	2240100	And then I beat you.
2240820	2245940	So from a day to day, how do you support yourself?
2246980	2248100	You don't win money from them.
2248100	2248660	Right.
2248660	2251940	In the meantime, are you logging video for a reality show?
2251940	2256740	In the meantime, I deliver pizzas.
2256740	2261620	Oh, well, that's got to get in the way, doesn't it?
2261620	2263780	Yeah, it kind of gets in the way.
2263780	2269060	Somebody orders a pizza and you have to finish being propositioned by someone who
2271060	2273140	only has letters to spell cat.
2274020	2274340	All right.
2274340	2278500	So Ben, you're up here because you had the worst day.
2278500	2281220	Although I have to say, it seems like a pretty good day in Phoenix.
2281860	2288020	Yeah, I guess my thought was that we would start with somebody who was like really down
2288020	2290020	and try to start in Phoenix.
2290020	2291060	Dan, dig deeper.
2291060	2293220	Maybe there's a time down.
2293220	2293700	All right.
2293700	2296180	Well, what really gets you down?
2296180	2297140	What are you worried about?
2297780	2298420	Let's start with this.
2298500	2300900	What would you, aside from winning Scrabble,
2300900	2303700	what would you really want to do if you could do anything?
2303700	2304580	I could do that anything.
2305460	2305780	Shit.
2308020	2309140	You can do that if you want to.
2310660	2315220	Like career-wise, do you want to be a musician or a writer or a rock and cheer builder?
2315220	2316660	I would be a writer or a musician.
2316660	2317860	Both of those sound pretty good.
2317860	2318980	Jesus, all right.
2320660	2322020	Just very impressionable.
2323140	2323780	Yeah, what else?
2323780	2324420	What else you got?
2324420	2328500	And you're delivering pizzas.
2328500	2329460	How old are you?
2329460	2330260	22.
2330260	2330740	All right.
2330740	2331860	So you get plenty of time.
2331860	2332340	You don't care.
2332340	2332900	Plenty, yeah.
2332900	2334020	But you're worried about it.
2334020	2339380	Like, I'm at a loss here.
2339380	2340020	Did you go to college?
2341460	2342180	Kind of, yeah.
2343940	2348020	I went to community college, and then I hurt my back really bad, and I got out of college.
2348020	2350180	You sprained your study bone?
2350180	2354820	Yeah, I herniated some discs in my back.
2354820	2355220	Oh, shit.
2355220	2357220	So I thought you were probably laid up for a while.
2357220	2358020	Yeah.
2358020	2359220	I put on like 60 pounds.
2359220	2360340	This isn't how I usually look.
2364420	2365140	All right.
2365140	2368740	Well, that's terrible.
2368740	2369540	So you got hurt.
2369540	2371620	You gained a bunch of weight because you couldn't probably...
2371620	2373540	You're just like laying in bed probably the whole time.
2373540	2374340	Yeah, playing Scrabble.
2375860	2376740	Are you still hurt?
2376740	2378180	That's what started the Scrabble thing.
2378180	2383940	No, but I choose to lay in bed still, just because I got so used to it.
2385380	2386020	It's comfy.
2386660	2387940	I got a really nice bed.
2387940	2393060	That was my gift for hurting my back, because I got a really, really comfortable bed, and I love it.
2399300	2401460	This is the worst day in Phoenix.
2403220	2404420	I don't think we should leave.
2404420	2404740	In Phoenix, yeah.
2405540	2406900	I think we've wandered into...
2406980	2408660	This might be paradise here.
2409700	2413300	Is everyone else out there just drinking margaritas all day?
2413300	2415220	You bring your back and they buy you a comfy bed.
2415220	2417540	You play Scrabble, and someone comes over and fucks you.
2418900	2422420	And then you go to a show, and you go, I had the worst day out of everybody.
2422420	2426580	But we did have to pull teeth to get up, and he wasn't saying right away.
2426580	2430180	I guess I'm thrown for a loop here, because I thought,
2430180	2432660	okay, somebody had a really bad day.
2432660	2435780	I would get to the bottom of some real angst here,
2435940	2438260	but I think what we're finding out is that Phoenix is just heaven,
2438260	2442180	and we should just roll with that concept that Phoenix is a great place to be.
2445380	2448740	You're booing the idea that your town is a great place to be.
2449380	2450420	Oh, the Tucson people.
2450420	2451140	God, fuck.
2451140	2453060	I can't keep up with the factionalism.
2454580	2455460	All right.
2455460	2460660	We should get a representative from Tucson and Phoenix to have it out up here.
2461300	2462420	Yeah, okay.
2462420	2462900	All right.
2464660	2465380	Where are you from, Ben?
2465860	2467060	I'm from Mesa.
2467060	2467540	Mesa?
2469060	2469940	Hey!
2469940	2474420	Wait, I think my buddy Greg Pribs is from Mesa.
2474420	2474900	I think so.
2476260	2477860	Jimmy Eat World's from Mesa, I think.
2477860	2478340	Who?
2478340	2479460	Jimmy Eat World.
2479460	2479940	Who's that?
2480980	2482100	They're that band that sings the,
2482100	2484100	Hey, you find yourself okay?
2484740	2486580	Then your head, you and me feel left out.
2487220	2488180	So look down on it.
2488180	2489700	It just takes some time.
2489700	2490500	You can find it, yeah.
2494340	2494840	Yeah.
2495780	2496340	Take it, Ben.
2497860	2499060	Yo, yo, yo.
2499060	2500820	All right, all right, all right, all right.
2502820	2503060	Yo.
2503060	2503380	Okay.
2504340	2506100	Yo, yo, yo.
2506100	2509140	Chillin' with Dan, sittin' on the can.
2509140	2511380	I gotta fart, but I can't.
2515620	2516420	Spit it, Dan.
2516420	2518500	Yo, yo, yo.
2518500	2520900	Spelling Scrabble letters happen.
2520900	2523620	People tell me they want to have sex with me.
2523620	2524900	My name is Ben.
2524900	2526020	Slipped into bed.
2526020	2530020	Don't know what to do anymore, but lay down with myself.
2531300	2532820	Fucked around all day.
2532820	2534260	Hurt my back again.
2534260	2535300	Going back into bed.
2535300	2536180	I'm fine.
2536180	2537060	You gotta cut it, cut it.
2537060	2539940	Come on down to Huntington.
2539940	2542340	Turn your frown upside down.
2543220	2545860	In yellow room is brown.
2545860	2548580	Go on down Arlington.
2548580	2549620	Yo, Ben.
2549620	2550980	I heard you played Scrabble.
2550980	2551460	Yeah.
2551460	2556820	Well, if you could win life's raffle, you say you'd be a writer or a musician,
2556820	2561300	but I don't know what to believe in nocturnal admission.
2561300	2561780	Stupid.
2563940	2565460	Can I say some things to you, Ben?
2566340	2567460	Just cut the music.
2567460	2568180	I'm a terrible...
2569700	2572100	I am the one in the room having the worst day.
2573140	2573640	Okay.
2575700	2578500	How much more does the truth have to stare me in the face?
2578820	2584980	You people are clearly happy, self-activated, and forgiving.
2586740	2588180	I'm sorry.
2588180	2589700	I am a fucking wreck.
2591460	2595860	I came into town and I don't feel comfortable in a stand-up club.
2595860	2597540	I'm trying too hard.
2597540	2599620	I don't like myself.
2599620	2601940	I'm not fishing for anything.
2601940	2603220	It has to stop.
2603220	2604660	Something has to give.
2604660	2606740	I'm a bad, bad person.
2606740	2610820	I don't understand why I would leave Los Angeles and traipse around the country
2611540	2617060	in a $100,000 bus going, hey, look at me broadcasting to the country.
2617060	2618260	Now we got to go to Austin.
2618260	2619620	Now what the fuck are we going to do?
2620820	2622660	Patton Oswalt was wrong about one thing.
2622660	2623860	Phoenix is amazing.
2623860	2624900	He was right about one thing.
2625780	2626420	I'm dead.
2626420	2627220	I'm dead on the water.
2627220	2628340	I'm burnt out.
2628340	2629380	I can't do it.
2630420	2631780	I wish I was dead.
2632980	2634180	I'm a bad person.
2634180	2636660	Ben, Ben, help me.
2637300	2638020	What do I do?
2642260	2645380	You got to pick up the pieces and move on.
2646100	2649700	You got to find a way to move on.
2649700	2652100	You got to move on.
2652100	2653380	You got to do so good.
2653380	2654020	Move on.
2654020	2654580	Got to move on.
2654580	2656660	You're kind of funny when you try.
2656660	2657140	Yeah?
2657140	2657780	Just kidding.
2657780	2658500	No.
2658500	2659460	No, you're really funny.
2659460	2660260	You're hilarious.
2661380	2662740	I got to move on.
2662740	2663460	Right?
2663460	2663860	Yeah.
2663860	2664180	Yeah.
2664900	2665220	Yeah.
2665220	2666180	Get your groove on.
2666180	2666820	Yeah.
2666820	2669620	Got to move on and get my groove on.
2669620	2672100	I'm kind of funny when I try, but not.
2672100	2672580	Why?
2674340	2674980	Tell me why.
2676980	2678980	Because your mind is a funny mind.
2678980	2679380	Just that.
2684340	2687300	Maybe, Dan, go sit down next to Ben.
2687300	2688100	Get back over there.
2688900	2690820	Maybe Ben should be asking you the questions about...
2692420	2692820	Yeah, yeah.
2692820	2693380	What do you want to ask?
2693380	2695460	Because I guess, Dan, we're doing this tour.
2696340	2698100	And we still don't know why you're doing this,
2698100	2699380	why you're putting yourself through all this.
2699380	2700020	I don't know.
2700020	2700820	They don't know.
2700820	2702020	Bobby Lee doesn't know.
2703060	2704260	I could guarantee you one thing.
2704260	2705540	This fucking club doesn't know.
2707460	2709460	They're like, oh, man.
2709460	2711140	Ben, yeah, maybe it's time for...
2712500	2713860	He can dig deeper into you.
2715060	2719140	Ben, what have you always wanted to know about me?
2719140	2724660	I promise, I'm sure you stay up in your orthopedic bed.
2726900	2728420	There's no such thing as an orthopedic bed.
2729540	2730340	That means foot.
2732660	2733140	No, that's...
2733940	2737300	I'm sure you stay up at night asking yourself things about me.
2738100	2739140	Now's your big chance.
2740020	2740500	Ask me.
2746180	2750740	If you could be anything, what would you be?
2750740	2752180	A professional entertainer.
2752580	2756900	A person with an act.
2756900	2760820	A person that knew how to make people happy.
2760820	2762500	Thank you.
2762500	2762980	Thank you.
2762980	2763940	Make a lot of people happy.
2765380	2766260	Thank you, Dad.
2766260	2766740	Thank you.
2767940	2769380	My dad's from Phoenix, did you know?
2770500	2771140	He's right here.
2773540	2775140	Here's another thing I want to be.
2775140	2777460	Someone who doesn't make people say things like that.
2777460	2779620	I don't want to be a drain on people.
2779620	2783540	I don't want to be a person who makes people fill his void.
2783540	2786420	I want to come out and do a thing.
2788420	2791060	Ben, I think I got it.
2791060	2792020	I got it.
2792020	2793460	We can wipe the slate clean.
2794820	2797460	Can you emcee for me and introduce me?
2799060	2804980	I'll come out and I'm going to do this for real.
2804980	2806180	I'm going to earn this venue.
2810180	2811220	Oh, wait.
2811220	2812340	Okay, hold on.
2812340	2813700	Just a little more insecurity.
2814260	2814900	Put this here.
2815940	2816580	All right.
2816580	2823940	Ben, you use this mic and then introduce me like you're an emcee at a stand-up club.
2823940	2825220	And then I'll come up.
2832660	2838500	Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Dan Harmon, the entertainer.
2839620	2843860	Fuck.
2845860	2846900	Jesus Christ.
2848020	2848580	What is this?
2848580	2853140	A picture of your city or a fucking or a blurry photo?
2855380	2857380	I got to tell you, I'd rather be in Tucson.
2859780	2860260	Okay.
2860260	2860740	All right.
2860740	2862100	Hey, keep it going for Ben.
2862100	2863460	You're never seen tonight.
2864100	2864980	And Brianne.
2864980	2865540	I'll tell you.
2865540	2869300	I'll tell you something.
2869940	2877300	You know, I've seen guys with shirts on before, but I didn't know whether to look at them or
2882660	2883460	not look at them.
2890500	2892740	Pretty interesting coming here tonight.
2893540	2896260	I want to stop you.
2896260	2900100	I think that you got close to an emotional connection there with Ben.
2900100	2904180	And Ben was about to draw something out of you because I think Ben came up there.
2904180	2904980	And I'm not joking.
2904980	2908420	Ben came up and talked about his injury and what he went through.
2908420	2909860	And he gained a bunch of weight.
2909860	2911780	I think there was a moment there where everybody like...
2912660	2913220	Oh, my God.
2913220	2914980	Did the fucking buzz went away?
2914980	2915540	What was that?
2916180	2916820	It was Ben.
2918420	2920100	That was optional all night.
2920900	2923220	Yeah, that was driving me mad, by the way.
2923220	2924980	Jesus, I didn't want to say anything.
2924980	2925300	Yeah.
2925300	2926340	Because I didn't want...
2926340	2928580	If you didn't notice it, it was like, I don't want to call your attention to it
2928580	2929860	because then you notice it?
2929860	2933620	No, that's why Patton Oswalt hates Phoenix because of that fucking buzz.
2933620	2935380	And that's why I was...
2935380	2936660	I'm a bad entertainer.
2936660	2937220	The buzz...
2937220	2937940	It's the buzz.
2938740	2939700	I was...
2939700	2940580	The buzz is gone.
2940580	2941380	Now everything's...
2941380	2942100	Now I'm great.
2943860	2948660	But what I was going to say was that Ben, a complete stranger,
2948980	2952260	I would guess not a professional entertainer comes on stage,
2952260	2955700	sits down, reveals something honest and true for a moment.
2955700	2957460	And there was that moment, but I felt...
2957460	2959700	I think everybody in the room felt this connection like,
2959700	2962020	Oh, that's why he's bummed out.
2962020	2963460	It's not about Scrabble.
2963460	2966340	It's about the fact that he's injured and he gained some weight and stuff like that.
2966340	2969220	It was a moment we got close to revealing something about you.
2969220	2970660	We got close to it.
2970660	2973380	I don't think we got all the way in silence.
2973380	2978260	I didn't hear it because I was too busy trying to figure out what to say next.
2978260	2979620	Yeah. I mean, that's a moment.
2979620	2983380	You decided to do this tour and you come out and stand there with a microphone.
2983380	2990180	You feel this onus to live up to Bobby Lee and the guy with the Hawaiian shirt.
2991460	2992020	Don Ho.
2992020	2993300	And Gallagher lady.
2995780	2996020	Yeah.
2997300	3002980	Yeah. I want people to order a pound and a half of bacon ham and with syrup.
3002980	3004980	And I want them to relax and have a good time.
3004980	3008020	I want to be the reason they were entertained.
3008100	3010260	Yes. But then I can't.
3010260	3011860	Yeah. I'm outside the moment.
3011860	3014660	Like, well, I'm doing, I'm like, how do I do it right? How do I do it right?
3015380	3019540	It doesn't, it doesn't, it's not, it doesn't seem like the venue to, to talk about, you know,
3020900	3023540	you know, what's going on in my life.
3023540	3027460	And it, you know, because it's a, then you hear the silence and it,
3027460	3031220	the silence seems fine in the back of a comic book store, but it doesn't seem okay.
3032020	3035540	You can see the glow of the cash register and the, and the, you know,
3035540	3037300	the posters of Rob Schneider and stuff.
3038900	3040500	It feels weird.
3040500	3042580	And it is, they drove places.
3042580	3048820	They drove from, from Tempe and Mesa and Tucson and they, they deserve,
3048820	3049780	they deserve better.
3049780	3051060	Stop saying you love me.
3052020	3054740	It's a surefire way to lose my respect.
3054740	3055860	I hate myself.
3059300	3060020	Awesome.
3060020	3060900	Thank you.
3060900	3061860	I suck.
3061860	3062420	Yes.
3062420	3063060	I suck.
3063620	3064580	Thank you.
3064580	3065220	But I rule.
3066020	3066500	Shut up.
3068580	3070260	Wait, you're heckling the audience.
3071220	3072260	Hey, nice shirt.
3074820	3076660	You guys, you call yourselves an audience?
3080420	3081300	You can't booth her.
3083700	3084900	What was my worst day?
3084900	3086580	Someone said, tell me about your worst day.
3087140	3088100	What was my worst day?
3091780	3093700	Someone at someone yelled out show in Phoenix.
3095060	3095860	No, no, no.
3095860	3097860	I'm having a good time because you guys are nice.
3097940	3099300	You guys are good people.
3099300	3100580	What is a bad day for you?
3100580	3103140	What is like the worst sort of day for you?
3104180	3105940	When what is or is not happening?
3105940	3108980	Honestly, my worst days are, it's not unlike Ben Scrabble thing,
3108980	3110580	because it's like, it's about monotony.
3110580	3111780	It's about mediocrity.
3111780	3115860	It's about like, it's about the nightmare of like, oh, what am I doing?
3117620	3124420	It's like when I owe a network, a script, and I told him I'd have it to him by Monday,
3124420	3126820	and then like another day goes by.
3126820	3132420	And I just, I stare at the screen and I just, you know, I end up masturbating a lot and stuff.
3132420	3136820	And then I like, I kind of like, and then I go to bed and then I wake up and I go like,
3136820	3139780	oh, the script's still late, but my penis hurts.
3143060	3147380	I just came to this earth, like God made me, like made me out of clay,
3147380	3152260	put me out down on earth 40 years ago, said, go to it, do some things.
3152260	3155620	Here, I'll even give you a couple of extra abilities.
3155620	3160020	Like you can hear, you can type, you can type like, like over a hundred words a minute.
3160020	3162260	Here's a, here's a, here's a, here's a bonus.
3162260	3165140	You're, you can be, you can be very handsome.
3165140	3166900	He gave me that, that bonus.
3166900	3168100	He'd be a very good looking man.
3168100	3168740	No, I'm kidding.
3168740	3169540	I was a joke.
3171780	3173780	But, and then, and then you feel like you squandered it.
3173780	3176420	You wake up and you just feel like a bad person.
3176420	3179140	I think that's what drew me out here is it was like, I want something.
3179140	3184020	I want to feel like I, like I, you know, like, like I do something for a living.
3184820	3187620	I'm not a writer, you know, I wanted to, I wanted to,
3187620	3189620	maybe I always wanted to be an entertainer.
3189620	3190260	What's going on?
3192260	3192820	All right.
3193700	3194260	Is that Ben?
3194260	3194740	Who is that?
3194740	3195620	No, that's Ben's friend.
3195620	3197540	He's been very, like, he's engaging me.
3197540	3199300	It's like, he's not heckling.
3199300	3201060	He's, he's in my, he's in my fucking soul.
3201060	3201700	What's your name?
3202900	3203140	What?
3205860	3206500	Tyler, what?
3207380	3208340	Tyler Dandy.
3208340	3209300	Tyler Dandy.
3209300	3210660	Tyler Dandy's open my shit.
3211460	3213060	I enjoy your lozenges.
3214340	3214820	I don't know.
3217620	3219380	It just seems like a guy that would make lozenges.
3221620	3226180	What's the, uh, I have to check the, check the time because we have to, uh,
3226180	3226980	we have to do something special.
3226980	3227460	We're good.
3227460	3228580	We're good.
3228580	3229620	It was a nine 20.
3229620	3231060	Does that put us into D and D time?
3231060	3231700	When did we start?
3231700	3232180	A 20.
3233540	3233780	Yeah.
3234420	3234660	Yeah.
3234660	3236900	I mean, I don't know if any of you are fans of, uh,
3236900	3239220	Dungeons and Dragons and our Dungeon Master Spencer.
3239220	3246340	I think it's, I think it's, I think this issue hasn't been resolved.
3246340	3250580	Like, like, see me after the show and punch me and, uh, I'll give you your money back
3250580	3253380	and I'll cry and I'll sign something for you too.
3253380	3258500	But, uh, like, let's, let's, let's, let's bring Spencer up to the stage, our Dungeon Master.
3264180	3265300	And I just want to make sure
3269220	3284020	Do we have, uh, oh, do you, do you, do you have, do you have characters for, uh,
3284020	3286100	for, uh, do you have Mulrain's character?
3286100	3286980	Yeah, I got everyone.
3286980	3287300	All right.
3287300	3291140	That's a, that's a good, good, good opportunity to bring my, uh, my girlfriend,
3291140	3292660	the lovely Aaron McGathey up here.
3292660	3293860	Aaron McGathey, everybody.
3293860	3300500	So I just want to make sure before we proceed any further,
3307540	3312180	there's nobody in the audience for sure who was like, who got a phone call a couple of days ago
3312180	3314980	from stand up live that said, you've won a contest.
3316020	3317380	A limo will pick you up.
3317380	3319700	There's a six drink minimum with you and 20.
3319700	3322820	There's nobody here that was like, like, what the fuck is this?
3322820	3324580	Okay. All right. All right.
3325220	3326180	Like they'd say, yes.
3326180	3331300	Cause I, but that was my big nightmare was of course, there's some lady in the back going like,
3331300	3333300	like, I don't understand what's happening.
3333300	3334740	Babe, babe, it's going great.
3336340	3337380	I'm not fishing for that.
3341060	3342180	Your hair looks beautiful.
3342180	3346660	You did a great job with the merchandise and she was out there running the merchandise table.
3346660	3347060	Thank you.
3347060	3348740	It's going to be open after the show.
3348740	3350340	So please, please come on by.
3351060	3353540	Spencer's setting up his D and D equipment.
3353540	3357700	Spencer, if you will, please get us up to date and recap where we are in our campaign.
3358340	3358820	All right.
3361300	3366500	Last time our heroes had met with Lord Butzalot of the Butzalot barbarians,
3367060	3369620	the group have been puzzling over the fragments of power,
3369620	3374660	those shards of great arcane energy, but unsuccessful in the wreckage of the white
3374660	3377940	skull encampment, a horse drawn wagon approached Sharpie and crew.
3377940	3382340	The wagon opened up revealing a magical storefront and a halfling merchant by the name of Olaf.
3383060	3386260	While Quark and Olaf haggled over scrolls and portable holes,
3386260	3388420	Sharpie had a heart to heart with his father.
3388420	3391220	Not long after the group heard a strange noise.
3393940	3398260	Loosing Avenger Sharpie's familiar, the Hawk scouted out the enemy.
3398260	3402500	Aided by Olaf and his shoot gun, the group slew the displacer beast,
3402500	3404180	but the piece was short lived.
3404180	3409540	A large rift opened in the sky and out poured the black fleet of Admiral Darkstar.
3409540	3413300	The fleet launched many black cylinders, which impacted the earth with heavy thuds.
3414020	3414980	That's where we left off.
3416980	3420180	Admiral Darkstar is, yeah, Spencer, everybody.
3422180	3423060	That makes sense.
3425540	3426020	Yeah.
3426020	3429060	We're on tour, we're on a tour bus with a dungeon master.
3429060	3431380	I don't know if that, that may be a first.
3431380	3433460	Yeah, that's, we still,
3433460	3434340	we still don't really.
3435460	3437060	Spencer, you got fans out there, man.
3440420	3442660	I mean, they're, they're Tucson fans.
3445380	3448980	We were warning Spencer, like, who's, you know, not, not accustomed to this was like,
3448980	3451700	he has, Spencer's got his own fans out there and you're gonna,
3451700	3453140	you're gonna have to get used to that, Spencer.
3453140	3454420	You're a celebrity now.
3454420	3455140	I guess.
3456740	3457220	Oh, thank you.
3457860	3459060	Yeah, we're on the bus with Spencer.
3459060	3460660	We don't, we still don't know anything about him.
3460660	3462580	We know that he works in the back of an Apple store.
3463700	3465060	And then he lives with his parents.
3465060	3467140	And I may or may not have brought weapons.
3467140	3468180	Right.
3468180	3469700	Wait, for real?
3469700	3470580	He never sleeps.
3471380	3472100	He can't sleep.
3472100	3472100	
3472100	3472900	That's true.
3472900	3473060	Yeah.
3473860	3474260	Don't sleep.
3474260	3474980	You don't sleep?
3474980	3475460	No.
3476580	3477540	Are you an insomniac?
3477540	3478660	Tried at once, didn't like it.
3480820	3482020	No, I do sleep, I sleep.
3482020	3482980	I'm a human.
3482980	3484340	Yeah, of course he sleeps.
3484340	3485860	That's, you protest too much.
3485860	3487540	That's not a, yeah.
3487540	3488500	Spoken like a robot.
3489540	3491540	I've never, I've never said I'm a human.
3491620	3493300	I've never plugged into any science.
3497300	3498500	All right, so ready to go.
3498500	3500660	So right now, there's just giant thuds
3500660	3502260	crashing around us from Admiral Darkstar.
3502260	3505300	Admiral Darkstar's fleet has been pursuing everyone
3505300	3508580	or it's been, you know, unleashing on the, on the plane.
3508580	3510260	Are we in danger right now?
3510260	3513380	You see several large black cylinders
3513380	3514980	thudding to the ground mysteriously.
3514980	3517380	You don't know if this is danger, but it doesn't bode well.
3518900	3519300	Quark.
3519940	3520420	Quark.
3520900	3522980	Sharpie, I was falling behind you.
3522980	3524500	I was only a few miles behind.
3524500	3526420	I had some business with some birds.
3527860	3529220	I heard the thuds.
3529220	3530180	I'm here to help.
3530180	3534180	I have plenty of arrows and a great sense of adventure.
3535540	3537780	Go run into those thudding cylinders
3537780	3538740	and find out what they are.
3541940	3542740	Shoot them in the feet.
3544500	3548500	I am brave and I am not a very smart character.
3548580	3551300	So I inspect the thuds.
3551300	3552260	Is that possible?
3552260	3555140	You see what looks to be a large black cylinder.
3555140	3558180	It's at least four feet tall and about a foot and a half wide.
3558180	3559780	Its surface is black and unlocked.
3559780	3561620	Mart, shiny like metal.
3561620	3562980	I found a table, everybody.
3565860	3567220	You found a cylindrical table?
3567780	3570260	I found a 1980s Coke table.
3574100	3576580	I detect magic on it.
3578660	3579380	Nice.
3579380	3581940	You detect magic coming from the cylinders.
3582660	3584100	You kind of figured that would happen.
3584100	3586660	Swiftly, the black ships sail overhead.
3586660	3588020	They're going towards the west.
3588580	3590900	Mango Butzalot's face grows cold.
3591540	3592260	My cap!
3594980	3595860	Your cap?
3595860	3596740	My camp?
3596740	3598020	I don't enunciate well.
3602420	3604020	Yeah, you were unconscious for a while.
3604020	3604580	It's okay.
3605380	3607300	So your camp is leaving?
3607380	3608740	They're going towards his camp?
3608740	3609940	It looks like it.
3609940	3611700	To me, my barbarians.
3611700	3615220	His barbarians approach him and suddenly he swirls his cloak.
3615220	3619460	In a vicious flourish, he's gone, as are his barbarians.
3620100	3621300	Well, they're walking away.
3621300	3622180	He didn't teleport.
3622180	3623300	Oh, he teleported.
3623300	3623780	What?
3623780	3624020	Yeah.
3625300	3626420	So he just went poof.
3626420	3629220	Magic is a thing that exists in the world you're in.
3629220	3632660	I know, but my dad, he's just a guy that eats sharks.
3632660	3633220	He has a magic belt.
3633220	3634980	Who knows what other magic things he has.
3634980	3635540	Oh, man.
3635540	3637060	He didn't even say goodbye.
3637060	3638100	No, he didn't.
3638100	3639460	So he's going back to his camp.
3640100	3641140	You don't even know, man.
3642340	3645060	You saw a large group of men just disappear.
3645060	3646420	But he said, my cap?
3646420	3648020	Yeah, so I mean, that's a fair assumption.
3648020	3651540	Yeah, he's not going to Taco Bell.
3651540	3652260	Right.
3652260	3652900	You never know.
3652900	3653860	He loves his Taco Bell.
3653860	3658100	Are the columns making any noise after they fall to the ground?
3658100	3659780	It's funny that you should mention.
3659780	3663780	You hear the whirring and clicking of mechanics and clockwork gears.
3663780	3666580	Slowly, the cylinders begin to lift out of the grass,
3666580	3667540	floating in midair.
3669300	3671860	They hang there strangely, menacingly.
3675220	3676740	You're being menaced by cylinders.
3678260	3679540	It won't be the last time.
3680820	3683220	I mean, do we have to confront these cylinders?
3683220	3685220	Or should we just get the hell out of there?
3685220	3685860	I don't know, man.
3687060	3687540	I'm sorry.
3688980	3690260	You can't ask me what to do.
3690260	3690820	That's the thing.
3690820	3691300	No, no, no, no.
3691300	3692100	I'm not asking you what to do.
3692820	3694260	How big are the cylinders?
3694260	3696420	They're four foot tall, but one and a half foot wide.
3696420	3698020	And they're round and they're metallic.
3698020	3699380	Maybe the size of a garbage can.
3699380	3703540	Four foot tall cylinders that are sitting on the ground, or they were?
3704180	3706020	They're in the suspended in the air.
3706020	3710100	Now they're menacingly hovering, and there's clockwork sounds coming out of them.
3710100	3711540	This ain't no benign hovering.
3713300	3714980	Quite sharpie.
3715780	3716740	I'll be brave.
3716740	3720180	I'll inspect the columns, the floating columns.
3720740	3721140	All right.
3721140	3723140	I feel like I should prepare in some way.
3723300	3726900	And that includes with my hands.
3726900	3728340	I also inspect with my hands.
3729540	3734020	You search the column for any markings or demarcations or marks.
3735700	3737140	You don't see anything.
3737140	3738260	The surface is clean.
3738980	3740420	There is nothing here, gentlemen.
3742820	3743220	All right.
3743220	3744100	Well, let's pack it in.
3744100	3744420	Let's...
3745060	3748420	You hear a loud obnoxious siren emitting from the cylinders.
3748420	3749140	Siren?
3749140	3749620	Siren.
3750100	3751700	You feel sick to your stomachs.
3752260	3752660	Oh.
3757700	3757940	Wait.
3757940	3760020	Jeff and Dan are fine, but Mulrain is...
3760020	3760580	I'm sorry.
3760580	3764260	Quark and Sharpie are fine, but Mulrain is afflicted with sickness.
3764260	3766580	Oh, I gotta sit down.
3768020	3768580	Excuse me.
3768580	3769940	I will stand behind this tree.
3770900	3775700	I know what this feeling means, and I'd like to be alone.
3775700	3777460	You're so sick that you think there's a tree.
3778100	3778580	I'm sorry.
3780260	3780580	What?
3782660	3783160	Yeah.
3784100	3788900	Well, and when I say tree, I mean just some sort of obstruction.
3788900	3789400	Yes.
3791220	3792100	You're behind it now.
3792660	3793140	All right.
3793940	3796500	Can I ask what my spell mage hand is?
3796500	3799940	Mage hand allows you to levitate light objects up to five pounds.
3799940	3800900	They're already levitating.
3800900	3802100	You don't know that.
3803300	3803700	What about...
3804420	3806180	I just found I can perform the loot.
3806180	3807380	Should I play some loot right now?
3807380	3808740	Is that a bad time?
3808740	3810260	You're gonna throw a knife at the moon?
3811060	3811460	What?
3811460	3812340	That's a throwback.
3812340	3813300	You can play the loot.
3813300	3814260	No, no, I'm kidding.
3814260	3815060	I don't want to play the loot.
3816260	3817060	I have listened.
3817940	3818580	Listening skills.
3818580	3820980	I go up to one of the cylinders and I listen.
3820980	3824100	It's emitting a loud obnoxious siren that's making you feel kind of sick.
3824100	3825140	I stop listening to it.
3825140	3825460	All right.
3826660	3829620	I produce my crystal shard.
3829620	3831300	You produce your crystal shard.
3832100	3832740	It's not crystal.
3832740	3834660	Whatever it is, that shard thing.
3834660	3836340	The fragment of power is produced.
3836340	3836900	Right, right.
3838020	3838500	Thank you.
3840100	3841140	I produce mine as well.
3841380	3842500	Do I still have one?
3842500	3842820	Yeah.
3842820	3844100	And we kind of rub them together.
3845380	3846580	Just the tips of them.
3846580	3848180	I produce a different kind of shard.
3852820	3854660	That's like my first poop joke I've ever made.
3855860	3856500	Sorry, everybody.
3857060	3857940	You poop shards?
3859620	3860660	That might be useful.
3862820	3865300	Do our two shards have any magical powers together?
3865860	3867860	Well, I mean, you touch them together, right?
3867860	3868420	You rub them together.
3868420	3869860	Yes, we're rubbing our shards.
3869860	3870740	Nothing's happening.
3871620	3872580	Not happening.
3872580	3873620	I hold them toward that.
3873620	3875940	I walk toward one of the cylinders with the shard.
3875940	3878660	We must look at the biggest idiots in the world from anyone's perspective.
3879300	3881700	Just cylinders are hanging and we're just...
3881700	3884260	Are there any D&D fans out there who know what to do and we don't?
3886260	3887060	What?
3887060	3887620	Oh, it's just...
3888660	3889700	Take out your flesh knife.
3889700	3890100	That's just...
3892100	3892900	You play Scrabble?
3895380	3898260	What if he really was the guy that was playing Scrabble with Ben?
3898660	3902660	Two of the cylinders rise up and fly towards you.
3904100	3907460	They strike both Quark and Sharpie in the chest.
3907460	3908100	We should have attacked.
3908100	3908900	Aha!
3908900	3909300	Oh, no.
3910340	3910980	It's not fun.
3911860	3914420	I use Alchemist's fire.
3914420	3914900	All right.
3915620	3917380	Okay, so that's a thrown weapon.
3917380	3919780	So Quark takes six damage.
3920660	3922420	Sharpie takes two damage.
3922420	3923540	Throw the Alchemist's fire.
3924820	3925380	It hits!
3926340	3926820	Aha!
3926820	3928340	It does four damage.
3929060	3930500	The cylinder's now on fire.
3932340	3932820	Great.
3935220	3936180	That's exactly what I wanted.
3936180	3937700	You both relax.
3937700	3939460	Feel free to lie next to each other.
3939460	3941140	Use each other's bodies for comfort.
3941140	3944660	Can I take out my bag of holding and remove one of these from the sky?
3944660	3945700	Or is that a bad idea?
3945700	3946820	Remove one of what?
3946820	3949940	Can I throw my bag of holding over one of the cylinders?
3949940	3951940	That'd be a tricky move.
3951940	3953220	It might be possible.
3953220	3953860	Do you attempt?
3954500	3958260	No, I take out portable hull and I make them fall into a portable hull.
3958260	3960340	Well, it floats, so it doesn't fall in a hull.
3960340	3960820	I...
3960820	3961060	Oh.
3962580	3962900	Sorry.
3964020	3964980	I take out my loot.
3967460	3968180	You play okay.
3970180	3973140	Can I ask you a question, Spencer, about one of my spells?
3973140	3973860	Any of them.
3973860	3974340	All of them.
3975940	3976980	Detect thoughts.
3977780	3981220	Detect thoughts would probably not work on metallic entities.
3981220	3982900	Yeah, well, I thought maybe there'd be a...
3982980	3984020	Things with brains.
3984020	3984420	Oh, yeah.
3984420	3986180	Well, I mean, you could do and detect nothing.
3987300	3988900	Spencer, may I use an anchor?
3989620	3990340	Do you have an anchor?
3990340	3990580	Oh, yeah.
3990580	3991060	I do.
3991060	3992820	Okay, so you have Quall's Feather Token.
3992820	3994980	That's a token that can turn into an anchor, so...
3995620	4002980	May I use Quall's Feather Token to anchor the things on fire to the ground?
4002980	4003460	Adventure!
4004260	4005300	You toss the token.
4008260	4009220	It doesn't do anything.
4009220	4010340	It falls on the ground.
4010340	4010660	All right.
4010660	4011380	Sorry, gentlemen.
4011540	4016820	So I take off all my clothes, and I go right under one of these things.
4016820	4018020	They're floating in the air, right?
4018740	4024740	Like, I take off my robe, and I lay naked under it, and I look up at it, and I go...
4030980	4031780	Nothing happens.
4032980	4034900	I think we should just go.
4034900	4036020	I think we could just leave.
4036020	4037540	Yeah, so are we...
4038260	4039300	Are these friends or foe?
4040020	4041860	No, they just attacked us.
4041860	4043220	I took, like, six damage.
4043220	4045860	Okay, you know, I keep doing it, but I have a thing here.
4046580	4053860	I take out my mysterious emerald dagger, and I go into a rage.
4053860	4057700	Producing your emerald dagger, you fly into a barbarian rage.
4057700	4060020	Your mind clouds with anger and rage.
4060020	4061140	You can't think clearly.
4062660	4063620	I attack.
4063620	4064980	You attack in your rage.
4065700	4066340	You attack...
4066340	4067620	A cylinder.
4067620	4068580	The flaming cylinder?
4068580	4068980	Yes.
4069300	4070660	You attack the flaming cylinder.
4071620	4072740	Oh, you miss really hard.
4074580	4076580	In your rage, you can't hit anything.
4076580	4078980	Oh, I get out of my rage.
4078980	4080020	You end your rage.
4080020	4081380	You feel slightly fatigued.
4082580	4084740	I slowly put my clothes back on.
4086340	4087380	You re-robe.
4087380	4091620	I watch and giggle uncomfortably, and pretend that I'm writing, but I'm not.
4091620	4093380	You hear a loud crackling noise.
4093380	4095300	Lightning is arcing between the cylinders.
4096580	4098420	The three of you are struck by bolts of lightning.
4098980	4099540	Oh!
4102820	4103300	All right.
4104260	4105940	Sharpie takes six damage.
4105940	4106420	Jesus.
4106420	4108100	Quark takes three, and Maureen takes one.
4109140	4110180	Ha-ha!
4110180	4110900	Strongest!
4111940	4114260	So we're fighting two giant thermoses right now.
4114260	4115380	We're getting our asses kicked.
4115380	4116100	Three.
4116100	4116500	Three.
4116500	4117220	Three thermoses.
4117220	4118420	Anybody out there know what to do?
4118420	4120420	That's why I'm talking about the darkness.
4122500	4123140	It's the second...
4123140	4124820	They're just references to the...
4125700	4126660	They're very loving...
4128180	4128900	Ray of Frost.
4129380	4130660	What are water skins?
4131460	4133140	Those are like bags that hold water.
4135860	4136900	They're necessary.
4137940	4139060	I do a power attack.
4139780	4140740	You do a power attack.
4140740	4143460	You could choose between one and three.
4143460	4144580	Three is the most damage.
4144580	4145860	One is the least damage.
4145860	4146500	Three.
4146500	4146980	All right.
4148580	4149060	You hit.
4150260	4151060	You deal.
4152100	4153860	This is so slow, you guys.
4155220	4156340	12 damage.
4156340	4156900	Fuck yeah.
4159860	4161860	The cylinder splinters into fragments
4161860	4163460	and falls to the ground in earth.
4163460	4164340	Fragments?
4164340	4164900	Fragments?
4164900	4166500	Not those, just like metal ones.
4166500	4167460	Not shards.
4167460	4168100	Not shards.
4168740	4169460	Fragments.
4169460	4170340	All right.
4170340	4171460	Ray of Frost.
4174660	4176420	A lot of Ray of Frost fans out there.
4176420	4176980	They love it.
4176980	4177780	They love the Ray.
4178660	4179220	It misses.
4183220	4184260	Come on, Maureen.
4184260	4184820	Shoot a thing.
4186500	4188660	These cylinders, they didn't even do anything wrong.
4189620	4192500	They shouldn't lightning bolts at us,
4192500	4193940	and they won't knock me in the chest.
4193940	4195060	If you hang out long enough,
4195060	4196180	they will eventually attack you.
4196180	4196740	Yeah.
4196740	4199460	Spencer, are they both on the ground or just one?
4199460	4200500	One of them's dead.
4200500	4202340	The other two are floating around.
4202340	4202660	Okay.
4203300	4205940	I take two arrows,
4206740	4208340	and I split them into a V,
4208340	4210020	which is something I do all the time.
4210980	4212180	I split them into a V,
4212180	4213380	and I pull them back,
4213380	4216100	and with my two eyes that are able to go
4216100	4217380	two different ways, like a fish,
4218020	4220180	I pull them back and fire them.
4222900	4223780	Oh, they both hit.
4223780	4225460	Aha! Adventure!
4225460	4226340	That's a first.
4227540	4228340	That's a first.
4229860	4230340	Well done.
4231460	4232580	One of them takes five.
4232580	4233860	The other takes 12.
4233860	4234580	They're not dead,
4234580	4237780	but they seem a bit messed up, broken-ish.
4239060	4240420	What's wounded for a machine?
4242340	4243220	Broken.
4243220	4243860	Malfunctioning.
4243860	4244420	Malfunctioning. There you go.
4244420	4245380	There you go.
4245380	4246020	That area.
4248340	4248740	Fucking...
4248740	4249540	I got nothing here.
4250740	4252340	Well, luckily, it's the cylinder's turn again.
4252340	4252580	Oh.
4254020	4254260	Oh.
4255140	4256420	Mole rain and quark.
4256420	4258980	You take damage of some sort.
4258980	4260580	Six and five damage,
4260580	4262340	so six and five damage.
4262340	4263540	How am I doing here?
4263540	4265140	You're not doing so hot.
4265860	4266580	Don't I have, like,
4266580	4268100	heal moderate wounds or some shit?
4268100	4269140	You always think you do,
4269140	4269940	but you never have.
4270580	4271300	Okay.
4271300	4272740	You do have a pendant of healing.
4273940	4274820	My healing pendant?
4274820	4275540	Yeah.
4275540	4277140	I put on my healing pendant.
4278020	4278580	It's put on.
4278580	4279300	You think it'll...
4279300	4281460	It has to boot up if you recall.
4281460	4281860	All right.
4281860	4283540	I'll reboot.
4283540	4284260	Okay.
4284260	4285860	Can I take my water skins?
4285860	4286340	Yeah.
4286340	4286660	Okay.
4286660	4287300	They're taken.
4288340	4289940	So I'm holding my water skins.
4291540	4296660	I throw my water skins at the two floating columns.
4297220	4298180	Feeling sickened.
4298180	4299620	You seem a bit uneasy,
4299620	4301700	but you attempt this strange maneuver.
4303060	4304820	One of the water skins strikes,
4305460	4307940	lightening arcs across the surface of the disc,
4307940	4309140	and it falls to the floor.
4310100	4312500	Aha, all right.
4312500	4315460	When I was studying my sheet,
4315460	4317300	you knocked a disc off of a...
4317860	4318420	I knocked it.
4318420	4319380	They're weak to water.
4320020	4320580	Oh.
4320580	4320820	Oh.
4323860	4325060	I have water skins too.
4325060	4325540	Why?
4325540	4326020	Good.
4326020	4326980	I did the same thing.
4327860	4328260	It's not.
4328260	4328980	It's Dan's turn.
4328980	4329460	Oh.
4330580	4332100	You still have to boot up.
4332100	4332500	All right.
4333380	4336180	I cast Ray of Water.
4337940	4339220	It's a bit of a stretch.
4340980	4341780	Is that a real thing?
4341780	4342500	No, it's not.
4342500	4342900	It's not.
4342900	4343860	I thought I could lie.
4344900	4346260	Just pee on it.
4347620	4348020	Yeah.
4348020	4349380	You took your clothes off earlier.
4350020	4351300	It's not much of a stretch.
4351300	4351780	I try.
4351780	4353300	I don't have water skins.
4353300	4354260	I try to pee on you.
4354260	4355940	I'm going to roll for your bladder fullness.
4357140	4357780	Oh, shit.
4359780	4361220	You manage a petty stream.
4362820	4363860	It is but a trickle.
4365220	4366980	Did I hit it?
4366980	4369780	No, you barely hit the ground.
4370900	4372100	It almost evaporates.
4376420	4377780	I don't get why people find this funny.
4377780	4380340	Have we been reduced to peeing on robot cylinders?
4381460	4382500	It's all I can think to do.
4382500	4383460	I have three sheets.
4384500	4386340	That was smart of Mulrain to use water.
4386340	4387460	Is it my turn yet?
4387460	4387860	Yeah.
4387860	4390020	I take my water skin out and do whatever the hell she did.
4390020	4392180	You aren't as accurate with a throw as Mulrain,
4392180	4393300	but you do attempt it.
4393300	4394100	All right.
4394100	4395300	Oh, that's a good roll.
4395300	4397380	You strike the cylinder.
4398260	4400100	Water splashes across its surface.
4400100	4402660	It too falls to the ground inert.
4404260	4405540	Are they all gone?
4405540	4406100	They're all gone.
4406100	4406260	Yeah.
4407140	4407620	Good job.
4408260	4408500	Okay.
4408500	4409860	So we beat up three cylinders.
4412260	4413940	We don't know if they were trying to help us.
4413940	4415780	Are they full of skittles or something?
4416820	4418580	We open one and it's just Jesus Christ.
4420580	4421140	Good job.
4421620	4424180	I go up to one of the cylinders
4424180	4428820	and I spryly jump upon it and try to open it.
4428820	4430020	You spryly jump upon it.
4430020	4432180	I have a huge smile on my face and a really cute hat.
4433300	4434420	Where'd you get the hat?
4434420	4435060	From Olaf?
4436260	4436820	Yeah.
4436820	4438980	He dropped it out of his wagon.
4438980	4439700	I can roll with that.
4439700	4440020	Yeah.
4440580	4441540	She has a hat, you guys.
4442660	4443380	Okay.
4443380	4444340	You do this.
4444340	4445060	Nothing happens.
4447860	4450020	Maybe battle robots aren't full of treasure.
4451380	4454260	I touch one of them with a shard.
4454260	4455300	It's not going to do anything.
4455300	4456020	I think we...
4456820	4459460	These ships just dropped some robot poop
4459460	4462020	and we just stood here and fought them.
4462020	4462740	And we fought them.
4463940	4466020	But now your dad is after his encampment.
4466020	4468260	I said we ride toward the encampment
4468260	4470340	and now that we've beat these cylinders.
4470340	4473460	I think these were sent by a greater force, an evil force.
4474340	4475460	Well, we could have...
4475460	4476980	If we had just left in the first place,
4476980	4477940	would they have followed us?
4477940	4478500	I don't know.
4479460	4482340	Got to try different things, different approaches.
4482340	4484420	Well, I feel like I keep trying to run away.
4484420	4485860	Urinating almost worked.
4488100	4492100	Well, I guess we walk off into the distance
4492100	4493460	and the camera stays behind.
4493460	4498100	And I do a Judd Nelson breakfast club fist in the air
4499620	4500580	and freeze frame,
4502420	4506500	which will conclude the Dungeons and Dragons chapter, right?
4507220	4508260	Because there was no treasure.
4509060	4509540	Yeah.
4509540	4509860	All right.
4509860	4511060	Let's hear it for Spencer, everybody.
4511060	4511700	Thank you, Spencer.
4513700	4515140	We fought some cylinders.
4516260	4517380	You hear that, Austin?
4518740	4524900	When we get to Austin, we're going to continue that Dungeons and Dragons story.
4524900	4526420	I'll see you guys at the merch table.
4526420	4527060	Thank you, McGathey.
4527060	4528340	Two t-shirts for $25.
4528340	4529460	Eric McGathey, everyone.
4531060	4531540	That did...
4532420	4533220	All right.
4533220	4535220	In the past, we fought a big jello
4535220	4537540	because that's a story we told and we fought other things.
4538020	4540900	Are we missing some metaphor with the cylinders?
4541780	4544260	I felt very metaphorical, myself loathing.
4545380	4551220	I couldn't have overstated how badly I thought I did here at Stand Up Live in Phoenix.
4551220	4555060	And I felt like there was no better way to end it than fighting a cylinder,
4555060	4559220	not really knowing what to do and peeing and not hitting the cylinder.
4559220	4560100	I think we're missing a...
4560100	4561620	It felt very appropriate for me.
4561620	4563780	We're missing a grander point, I think, Spencer.
4563780	4564660	I think it's wrong.
4565300	4565700	We're not?
4566500	4567700	Sometimes you fight monsters.
4568260	4568660	Oh, okay.
4569700	4570900	Part of the game.
4570900	4572420	Is there a name for that kind of monster?
4572420	4574340	It's the Cylinder Monster.
4577460	4578500	Cylinder Monster.
4578500	4578980	Spencer.
4579940	4581700	It's a cylindrical construct.
4581700	4582260	I love it.
4582980	4583380	All right.
4583380	4585380	So now next time, we're off to go find...
4585380	4589780	I would imagine your father mango butts a lot at the barbarian encampment.
4589780	4592740	Let's learn one thing about Spencer before he goes.
4592740	4594420	Each city, let's learn 20 things.
4596180	4596660	Watch me.
4600900	4605780	Spencer, is there any detail you're willing to divulge about yourself
4605780	4606980	that you think nobody knows?
4607700	4610100	I have a condition known as syndactyly.
4610100	4613540	That means two of my toes on either foot are kind of fused together.
4613540	4614020	Whoa!
4618020	4618580	Can we see it?
4619620	4619940	Yeah.
4622580	4625060	Okay, Spencer's now taking his shoes off.
4625060	4626660	I've never seen anything like this.
4626660	4628740	We're making podcast history here, but...
4628740	4630660	See, though, they're stuck together.
4630660	4632580	They almost look like they're not, but they are.
4633540	4634100	Oh, they are!
4635220	4637140	You guys are never going to speak to me again.
4639220	4643460	We're going to be your best friend and Instagram the hell out of your foot.
4643460	4644100	What's it called?
4644100	4646100	And I'll make sure the mutants don't take you over.
4646980	4647940	Syndactylism?
4649140	4650420	Syndactyl.
4650420	4651300	That's amazing.
4651300	4652020	I didn't really see it.
4652020	4652820	I've never heard of that.
4652820	4654420	We're going to get a picture of that on the bus.
4654420	4655060	All right, well, that...
4656740	4659060	How many people in America do you reckon have that?
4661140	4661620	All of them.
4662980	4666580	Is there a statistic on how many people have syndactyl?
4666580	4669780	Three out of three Crittenden siblings have this.
4669780	4670980	All of your siblings?
4670980	4673620	Yeah, but no one else in any overextended family.
4673620	4674580	That's so weird.
4674580	4676340	Yeah, I had a girlfriend that had it too,
4676340	4679140	but those are the only four people I've ever known to have this.
4681620	4682660	Wait, you had a girlfriend?
4682660	4683220	You're weird.
4683220	4685620	You had a girlfriend with fused toes too?
4685620	4686020	Yeah.
4687300	4688980	Did you meet at a fused toe convention?
4689780	4690740	It was a support group.
4691620	4692420	No, you're kidding.
4692420	4693300	Yeah, no, I'm kidding.
4695060	4696020	How much of it was kidding?
4696020	4697380	Did you have a girlfriend that had the same thing?
4697380	4698660	Yeah, no, it happened, yeah.
4698660	4700500	Well, that must have blown your mind.
4700500	4701060	It did.
4703300	4704500	What happened to her?
4704500	4706580	She's fucking a 75-year-old guy.
4706580	4707060	Whoa!
4709940	4711300	Wait, what?
4711300	4712420	How old is she?
4712420	4714420	Let's save this for this feels terrible.
4714420	4716580	No, she's 22.
4716580	4717060	22?
4717060	4718420	She's fucking a 75-year-old guy?
4718420	4719780	Yeah, that's older than her dad.
4721700	4722820	I'm not bitter at all!
4727220	4728740	I'm sorry, it's a lot to take in.
4729300	4730900	It's a lot for me to take in.
4730900	4732420	How fresh is that wound?
4732420	4733540	How long ago did you break up?
4733540	4735460	I mean, it's fresher than it ought to be.
4737060	4738740	That wasn't explanatory at all.
4738740	4739380	No, I gotcha.
4740020	4740820	It's a while, but you-
4740820	4741860	I found out in April?
4742900	4746100	And she left you for a 75-year-old guy.
4746100	4746740	Yeah.
4746740	4747860	That's allowed to be fresh.
4747860	4749620	And that's why I have no self-esteem.
4751460	4751940	All right.
4753300	4755380	I feel a lot better now about-
4756420	4757540	Thank you, Spencer.
4759620	4760580	I love Spencer.
4760580	4761540	I feel worse now.
4763060	4764020	Yeah, I don't know.
4764020	4764740	I can't help you.
4766020	4767060	Every man for himself.
4767620	4768260	I'm leaving.
4769460	4770420	Spencer, everybody.
4771380	4772660	God bless you, Spencer.
4774260	4774820	Amazing.
4776180	4778020	His toes are fused together.
4778020	4779780	Los Angeles, he just raised-
4779780	4781700	I said, is there a dungeon master in the audience?
4781700	4782980	He raised his hand.
4782980	4784580	He's now on a bus with us.
4784580	4786260	His toes are fused together.
4787220	4788260	I don't know where to-
4788260	4789060	I don't know how to-
4789060	4789780	What's happening?
4789780	4791860	We're gonna learn one new thing about him,
4791860	4793300	each city we go to.
4793300	4794820	It started with the toe thing.
4795860	4797380	We got 19 cities to go.
4798420	4800180	Do you feel like you've learned anything?
4801140	4802420	We're gonna learn that he's God.
4802420	4803380	It's gonna be like one-
4804980	4805860	By the end of the tour,
4805860	4807540	it's gonna be like the seventh seal.
4809220	4811540	We're gonna find out that we are all
4811540	4813700	in his Dungeons and Dragons game.
4817220	4818580	I think that's very reasonable.
4818580	4820500	I think we've talked about this.
4820500	4821620	I think the prediction is that
4821620	4823620	the movie ends up being mostly about Spencer.
4823620	4824660	Oh, definitely.
4824660	4826980	He's certainly the most interesting of all of us.
4826980	4828420	Yeah, the movie's not even made yet,
4828420	4829140	and I'm already-
4829540	4830660	Because you're narcissistic.
4830660	4831460	I'm just vain.
4832660	4835140	Spencer is, I think, noble in some way
4835140	4836260	that we're yet to find out.
4836260	4838740	Yeah, if these guys wanted to watch a movie
4838740	4840740	about a guy who comes out on stage
4840740	4842420	and goes, should I be on stage?
4842420	4844260	They could watch it about themselves.
4844260	4845940	Spencer is an amazing-
4845940	4847220	He's a national treasure.
4848420	4849220	He's incredible.
4849220	4849780	I hate him.
4849780	4850980	I'm gonna poison his food.
4852340	4853380	No, I love him.
4853380	4854180	He's incredible.
4854820	4856340	Did you have a question, Tyler Nandy?
4857300	4857540	Oh.
4859780	4860580	Do you have a statement?
4861620	4862420	Do you have a question?
4866420	4867380	Oh, sure, yeah, yeah.
4867380	4868500	He said, will you please tell us
4868500	4869700	what your new show you're working on?
4869700	4870820	I'm working on two of them.
4870820	4871620	On the tour bus.
4874260	4877380	I'm doing a CBS pilot that, you know,
4877380	4879380	it's multi-camera, which means that
4879380	4880820	there's a laugh track, probably.
4880820	4882020	Well, I shouldn't say a laugh track
4882020	4883700	would be before a live studio audience.
4883700	4884740	What's the premise, can you say?
4885540	4888740	It's a father-daughter relationship.
4889300	4889780	What's that?
4891620	4892900	I'm better than that.
4892900	4895380	I was just gonna say, like, the trouble is,
4895380	4898100	like, I worked on Community for three years
4898100	4901220	and the whole time, every day I got up out of bed,
4901220	4907220	I was going to work for people who wanted me to,
4907220	4910660	like, I was, by doing the thing that I wanted to do,
4910660	4912340	I tried trying to make people happy.
4912420	4916660	I was being the bad guy, and my attempt now
4916660	4919620	is to try to, like, segment things into,
4919620	4921940	I want to do a thing for CBS and a thing for Fox
4921940	4923860	and a thing for Adult Swim at the same time.
4923860	4925460	So the thing for Adult Swim is, like,
4925460	4927780	it's about a scientist with a diarrhea ray, you know?
4927780	4929700	It's like crazy shit that, you know,
4929700	4932260	the 15-year-old in You Will Love It, it's amazing.
4932980	4933940	It's being written right now,
4933940	4936260	and it's an incredible, incredible show.
4936260	4937700	You know, nobody will see it.
4937700	4939460	It's on Adult Swim, but you'll watch it,
4939460	4940820	and it's like, you'll love it.
4941380	4942420	It's a cartoon.
4942420	4944420	Then at Fox, I want to do, like,
4944420	4946420	something that's like the new community, you know?
4946420	4947780	Do something that's single camera
4947780	4949620	and, like, makes people happy.
4953540	4955940	And then at CBS, I also want to prove,
4955940	4956980	not in a cynical way,
4956980	4960580	I want to prove that something can be successful and good.
4960580	4963700	Like, it may not be your cup of tea, Tyler Dandy.
4965300	4967540	I'm basing that purely on the fact that you shouted out,
4967540	4969300	you can do better than that, Dan Harmon.
4970260	4971780	I hear you, I hear you.
4971780	4973860	I understand where that's coming from.
4973860	4976420	I know we've been indoctrinated into a culture of, like,
4976420	4980340	okay, popular shit sucks, and smart shit is not popular,
4980340	4984020	and I'm not disagreeing with you.
4984020	4985620	I understand your anxieties.
4986740	4990180	But I really, can I have your permission, Tyler Dandy,
4991700	4995460	to try as hard as I can to make a good, like, old...
4996100	4998580	Tyler, get up here, for fuck's sake.
4998580	4999940	Tyler Dandy, everybody.
4999940	5001780	I can't see him.
5001780	5004740	I'm not leaving here without looking Tyler Dandy in the eye.
5005620	5006900	Tyler Dandy.
5007780	5011380	Oh, shit. It's Andy Dick. Holy shit.
5011380	5012980	You get it all the time.
5012980	5015780	Oh, fuck, but Tyler, okay, I'm intrigued here,
5015780	5018100	because it's interesting you're calling out from the audience.
5018100	5020820	You're not a heckler, you're not, like, a drunk, raucous,
5020820	5022020	like, look at me guy.
5022020	5023060	I love you, Dan Harmon.
5023060	5024260	You're saying, I love you.
5024340	5026260	You're saying, I love you, and you're saying,
5026260	5028500	say, you're the voice in the back of my head.
5028500	5031060	I used your story circle to write my short stories.
5031060	5032180	Oh, thank you.
5032180	5034660	You're my hero. I'm nothing without you.
5034660	5035300	What do you, what do you...
5036260	5036740	Go on.
5038580	5041220	Well, what do you envision me doing?
5041220	5044260	Like, if I can do better than writing a CBS sitcom,
5044260	5047380	what do you envision me doing that would, like,
5047380	5050340	you would go, that's fucking Dan Harmon, he did it.
5050340	5054020	If you could make multi-camera work, that's amazing.
5054100	5055780	All right, well, yeah, that's why I want to try.
5055780	5059940	Yeah, you know, like, I'm with fated breath
5059940	5061060	for what you're going to do next.
5062180	5062740	I'm sorry.
5063620	5064180	If you could pick...
5064180	5067060	Season two of Community is the best thing I've seen on TV
5067060	5068260	in my entire goddamn life.
5069700	5071220	I liked it. It was good.
5072020	5073940	It's genius. Adderall and all.
5073940	5074980	I don't give a fuck.
5074980	5075460	Yeah.
5075460	5076180	You're a genius.
5076820	5078340	I should have taken some Adderall tonight.
5080660	5083940	All right, well, I don't know, what else do we have to say to Tyler?
5084420	5087380	Yeah, we're going to close it now.
5087380	5091620	Dan, there's times when I'm going to redeem myself.
5091620	5094500	It's not a time to talk. Sometimes the soul opens up
5094500	5096820	and you must sing or rap.
5096820	5098260	Do you remember the refrain, Brianna?
5099220	5100020	Yeah.
5100020	5102820	Yo, yo, yo, yo.
5102820	5105220	It's been a show. It's been kind of weird.
5105780	5108260	I'm sorry about it. Sorry about my beard.
5108900	5111380	Collecting all the food and all the tears
5111380	5115060	from the regrets and dreams that I ever had before.
5115060	5117220	Came to Phoenix looking for something new.
5117940	5120740	All I did, I feel, is disappoint you.
5120740	5123220	But you disagree. You say you love me.
5123220	5126420	But all I can do is look at cylinders and try to pee.
5127620	5130580	It comes out of my dick. It goes onto the floor.
5130580	5132740	I can't do nothing different.
5132740	5135860	I got Jeff Davis, professional improviser.
5135860	5138980	But I wanted to be an entertainment surprise-er.
5138980	5141860	Wanted to come out and do some cool shit.
5143140	5144580	I can't do it, dick.
5146500	5147140	Sorry. All right.
5148100	5148600	Wait.
5150100	5150600	Start.
5150980	5151480	Yo.
5152020	5153300	Oh, I have your microphone.
5156020	5156520	Classic.
5159060	5159560	Sorry.
5162180	5164420	Yo, yo, yo.
5164420	5165220	Cooling out.
5165220	5168180	Just no pressure. Just going out.
5168260	5171220	Just going to close the show with a rap.
5171220	5174820	But I'm not going to do too much intense crap.
5174820	5177860	Not going to punish the crowd for thinking too hard.
5177860	5178660	I'm not going to...
5179380	5181300	We're going to have the crystal shards.
5182180	5186580	I'm just going to rap and get over to Brienne so she can sing that.
5186580	5201220	Yo, I don't know what to do.
5201220	5204020	Got yellow pee, got brown ass poo.
5204020	5207060	I put it in a jar, put it in space.
5207060	5210100	I got on a rocket ship for every race.
5210100	5213060	I got black people, got white people too.
5213060	5216100	I got yellow people, got brown like poo.
5216100	5219220	I got rhyming shit that I've rhymed before.
5219220	5222580	But I never know what I'm doing three, four.
5223380	5229300	Come on down to Armand Town, turn the frown upside down.
5229300	5232340	B is yellow, poop is brown.
5232340	5234980	Come on down to Armand Town.
5234980	5237140	Yo, I can't stand myself.
5237140	5242340	I wish I was up on the dusty shelf because I'm fat and hairy.
5242340	5243620	Just turn 40.
5243620	5245220	Don't know what I'm doing.
5245220	5246260	I'm really sad.
5251220	5252100	It's not bad.
5253940	5254580	Dance break.
5258820	5261700	I ought to go to therapy instead of come here.
5261700	5264900	I'm really sorry to trout all my anxieties and fears.
5265460	5266660	You deserve better.

5376100	5378180	We have to leave it almost immediately.
5378180	5381940	But I think we can sign some shit out front if we have some time.
5383940	5385060	I love you guys for real.
5385060	5385780	You're so awesome.
5385780	5387620	Let's all go meet at the bar and have a drink right now.
5387620	5388100	How about that?
