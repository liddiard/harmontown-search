0	24560	Hello Meltdown, how are you all tonight?
24560	31960	Once again, Harmontown is in session in Hollywood, California at the Comfortable Confines of
31960	33760	Meltdown Comics Nerdmelt Theater.
33760	48840	Won't you please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.
48840	51720	We have so much to do tonight.
51720	52720	What the fuck?
53720	54720	Thank you.
54720	65160	Tonight's theme is litany, tonight's theme is lists, tonight's theme is items on the
65160	66160	docket.
66160	71880	I've got a pad of paper and a pen, I've got a Samsung giant phone, I've got Evernote,
71880	76200	I've got a list of shit I want to talk about tonight, and we're going to do it fast, because
76200	80800	I just got a note from you in the green room, the shows are getting too long, 90 minutes,
80800	89920	we'll make it 90 minutes, yeah, he's like the noid, he's like the noid, he's our enemy.
89920	94240	Nobody wants a two hour show, two hours is too long.
94240	102720	Alright, let's fuck settle in, I hope you brought some snacks.
102720	107560	In Jeff's defense, if we target a 90 minute show, it's a two hour show, so it's like Jesus
107560	113360	Christ, if you try to be a good person, you end up like okay, you chart that star, you
113360	120280	don't expect to hit it, thank you ma'am, somebody yelled out tweeted, item number one on the
120280	123080	list, let's just barrel through it, let's barrel through it, here's the only thing I
123080	128720	thought of today, this is from the Rob Delaney department, in other words, I thought this
128720	137040	was clever, okay, you know how when you die, you poop your pants, okay, here's how you
137040	142600	solve all of the world's problems, in my opinion, and I don't know how to enforce this,
142600	147040	I don't know how to create this environment, but this would solve all the world's problems,
147040	152360	when you die, instead of pooping your own pants, you get to choose whose pants you poop
152360	153360	in.
153360	157000	Wait, you can create poop in somebody else's pants?
157000	164120	Every, yeah, every, yeah, so like, every human being on earth, so their best behavior forever,
164120	166480	Dick Cheney's pants would constantly be filled with shit.
166480	171880	There would be no Dick Cheney, he would not do the things he'd done, he wouldn't do it,
171880	178240	he'd go, it's not worth it, every minute of every day, it's like a bell ringing and an
178240	183040	angel getting a twang, there's another load in my fucking pants, I can't do it, it's not
183040	188040	worth it, what's worth it, all the oil, all the money in the world, just every second,
188040	191640	another person dies that chooses me, my pants to crap it.
191640	195200	Also if you murder somebody and get away with it, the person that you kill gets to poop
195200	196320	in your pants at any time.
196320	200080	Oh, you know they will, you know they will, that's the least they can do.
200080	207400	It's like the game of werewolf, there's a card that you rarely use, I think it's like
207400	211520	the hunter or something, when the werewolf kills the hunter, the hunter gets to actually
211520	213880	pick somebody to take out as they go out.
213880	218600	If everyone had that power, no one would fucking, it's the perfect blend, there's too many people
218600	223240	in this world that chooses a religion, this idea that they're going to be punished in
223240	226440	the afterlife, that's fucked up because that means you're not on your best behavior in
226440	233040	this world, you think too much about the afterlife, it's too stupid, it's dumb, and then the other
233040	236880	end of the spectrum you have atheists who are like, well what's happening right here
236880	240240	is what's important, but they don't have a god, so they're not accountable to anything.
240240	246560	The perfect mix, the perfect karmic mix, okay, there is no afterlife, fuck that, but on your
246560	250680	way out of the game you get to shit in someone's pants, who's it going to be?
250760	254960	Alright, let's say Dan, let's say you get, a piano falls through the ceiling right now
254960	256840	and crashes and you die.
256840	262120	Then I get to go, time freezes as I die and Gabriel comes down, or if you prefer Allah
262120	272280	or Giuseppe, whatever your religion is, if you're Muslim or Italian, or if you're a fan
272280	276440	of half-life, that snake guy comes out with a suit and a briefcase and goes, mmm, Mr.
276440	284720	Gooden, good job, it seems the game is over, I expected a bigger response from my crowd
284720	294440	for the half-life reference, what's his name, G-man, they freeze time and they go, whose
294440	300280	pants would you like to shit in, and then you get a brief dialogue, Vincent Price comes
300280	301280	to you?
301280	305520	Yeah, kind of, yeah, Vincent Price, you get to choose, okay, you get to choose the form
305520	306760	of your shit accountant.
306760	307760	This is getting better.
307760	313160	Yeah, you can just choose, Gene Hackman comes up, good job, whose pants do you want to shit
313160	314160	in, soldier?
314160	319480	I go, Gene Hackman, I would like to know more about this piano that fell on me, good, good,
319480	321400	I like your style, soldier.
321400	324600	And then you move up and you see the guy that dropped the piano, I go, okay, why did he
324600	325600	drop the piano?
325600	330600	You get to spend, I don't know, you get a half hour, you get to move around with a camera,
330600	333160	it's like the half-life source of the dinner.
333160	337720	Does the person who poops their pants know that this is ghost poop, know that this is
337720	342360	a, this is, no, they don't, they don't, they don't, you never know, like if you're walking,
342360	345840	so there's people on this earth that are walking around and they're like, oh man, I'm such
345840	355080	a real estate mogul, who did that, fuck you, you don't know, but be nice tomorrow, mother
355080	356400	fucker, be nice.
356400	359240	You've revealed that you poop your pants a lot throughout the year, you're just gonna
359240	360800	think that you're a terrible person.
360800	367720	No, no, come on, you're being silly, that's dumb, it's not dumb, no, no, no, you have
367720	369440	admitted that you poop your pants from time to time.
369440	374480	Yeah, but that's, it always follows me going, I think I have a fart coming.
374480	375480	This follows nothing.
375480	376480	Oh, so you'll know.
376480	380040	You're in line at the bank and then your pants are filled with shit, it doesn't come out
380040	385120	of your butt, it suddenly teleports into your pants.
385120	389200	You're about to cash a check and you're like, oh, I have shit in my pants, and everyone's
389200	393160	going, what smells, who smells, what smells, oh, who's that guy?
393160	399040	And you know, it's like a comment section, like, okay, maybe that person, maybe the person
399040	403880	that pooped in his pants is crazy, maybe, give him the benefit of the doubt, because
403880	408640	if you don't, if you punish him too hard, if you go, hey, stinky, who'd you fuck over?
408640	414020	He might shit in your pants when he dies, so keep a little profile, that's the natural
414020	417180	effect it's going to have on our national psyche.
417180	419580	One death, one shit, you get to poop in one person's pants.
419580	424140	One solid fucking chunky poop in the pants of your choosing.
424140	429900	All right, Dan, let's say God forbid you drop dead tonight, and who would I choose?
429900	435080	No, first, who's your poop accountant, your poop meister?
435080	437140	Just off the top of my head, Bruce Valanche.
437140	438140	Bruce Valanche.
438140	443900	No, no, no, no, no, no, not whose pants do you poop in, first, who's your Gene Hackman,
443900	444900	who do you pick?
444900	452860	Oh, oh, who's my Gozer, like, my anti-Gozer, top of your head, top of my head, Noam Chomsky,
452860	453860	Noam Chomsky.
453860	454860	Noam Chomsky.
454860	455860	He's alive.
455860	460940	No, he's alive, they don't have to be dead, you know, fuck you, Juliet, I'm going to shit
460940	464100	your pants when I die.
464100	472340	All right, so Noam Chomsky comes out and says, taking time out of his trenchant social commentaries
472340	476900	and you tell him you want to poop in Bruce Valanche's pants.
476900	481180	Yeah, and I tell him why, and I get to, and he, no matter what, it's like contact, you
481180	485140	know, Jodie Foster's dad, like, it doesn't, he's a projector, so no matter what, Noam
485140	489380	Chomsky's not going to go, Dan, don't be petty, Noam Chomsky's going to go, you know what,
489380	496340	I discovered language at MIT, and I'm the foremost dissenter of American foreign policy,
496340	500560	Bruce Valanche, good choice, Dan, you know, and that's like, that's the joy you carry
500560	505000	into the afterlife, into oblivion, but you can't, but you can't leave a calling card.
505000	509440	They don't know who's, I don't want them to, because that's the important thing, right?
509440	514320	Because then you start, here's the, here's what, here's what, here's what, here's what,
514320	517640	here's what, here's what Dick Cheney will do.
517640	518760	Here's what Dick Cheney will do.
518760	523680	He'll go to the Pentagon, he'll go in the basement and go, I need you to invent a device
523680	529440	that flags all the shit coming into my pants and separates it.
529840	533760	If there's a name tag, I want you to track it, track it, and all their families go to
533760	538200	Guantanamo, see, I don't want any of that shit.
538200	542360	I want him to just have shit in his pants, so the volume of it is a measure of people's
542360	544000	anger against him.
544000	545000	That's it.
545000	546000	Why is this?
546000	547000	What the fuck did I do?
547000	551840	I'll tell you what you did, motherfucker, you fucked around too much, with too many people.
551840	554240	You got too high on the radar.
554240	555240	Welcome to America.
555240	561560	You got a bunch of shit in your pants, clean it up.
561560	567880	If you're going to be famous, be cool, be friendly, be nice, be Mother Teresa.
567880	571680	If you're going to be famous, if you're going to be on a coffee cup, be on a coffee cup
571680	573640	because you're the coolest person in the world.
573640	576680	And then every once in a while, still, you'll be driving down Hollywood Boulevard, like,
576680	580840	okay, some 15-year-old asshole wanted to fuck it with, okay, fine.
580840	585880	Yeah, but aren't famous, but you've read comment sections after an episode of a show
585880	586880	that you've made.
586880	587880	Yeah.
587880	588880	The people are petty.
588880	589880	Well, I'm an asshole.
589880	590880	Yeah.
590880	591880	I am partially an asshole, you know?
591880	595320	How much, if this went into effect, how many...
595320	599080	If things get signed into law.
599080	602080	Here's hoping it does.
602080	605720	It seems like a long shot, but if it does go into effect...
605720	609080	How many times do you think people are going to die and on their deathbed make you poop?
609080	611200	Honestly, do you think there's...
611200	612200	Thousands, hundreds.
612200	613200	Yeah, I don't know.
613200	614200	Strangers?
614200	615200	Yeah.
615200	616200	Really?
616200	617200	Well, no, that's not true, because you only get one.
617200	618200	You get one.
618200	619200	So you get passed up.
619200	622640	Who's going to use it too ironically, you know?
622640	623640	When I go...
623640	624640	My first...
624640	625640	Yeah, Kevin Smith.
625640	626640	I'll tell you what.
626640	627640	You know what?
627640	629040	You know who's going to get the most?
629040	631800	You, because it's your idea.
631800	633040	I don't get credit for the idea.
633040	636800	I don't want that.
636800	637800	That's not cool.
637800	642040	I don't want to do that, because then everyone's doing it, because after I make this happen,
642040	643040	everyone's going to resent...
643040	644040	Yeah.
644040	648520	I don't suppose you've seen Highlander too, but...
648520	649520	Yes.
649520	656080	Conor McCloud invented a shield that protects the earth from the effects of the depleted
656080	663560	ozone, and everyone resents him, because it's an eternal night, and also there's Highlanders?
663560	664560	It's 8.25.
664560	666200	I could go on and on about it.
666200	667200	You know what?
667200	670600	If I could change my answer, I would shit in the pants of the director of Highlander
670600	672640	too.
672640	673920	Not the writer.
673920	674920	Can I split my shit?
674920	675920	Can I split my shit?
675920	677920	Can I put half on the writer's pants?
677920	679360	All right, listen.
679360	680360	We got a litany.
680360	681360	A litany.
681360	682360	We have a list, okay?
682360	683360	We have a menu.
683360	684360	Can we just move on?
684360	685360	Sure.
685360	686360	Okay.
686360	687360	Jeff.
687360	688360	All right.
688360	689360	I spent today...
689360	690360	I changed my phone to Android.
690360	691360	A couple...
691360	692360	I just sent you a text, by the way.
692360	693720	Oh, well, I have my volume down.
693720	694720	So this is...
694720	695720	All right.
695720	696720	Give me one second.
696740	697740	Explain.
697740	698740	I just...
698740	700240	This is the benefit of an Android phone as opposed to an iPhone.
700240	701240	I'll send...
701240	702240	I'll resend that text.
702240	703240	Yeah.
703240	705600	I spent today pimping out my phone notification-wise.
705600	707880	Like I downloaded different sounds and set them.
707880	709840	So send me a text first.
709840	710840	Send me a text.
710840	711840	Okay.
711840	712840	Sending right now.
712840	717920	Yeah, that was a Star Trek sound.
717920	718920	Yeah.
718920	719920	All right.
719920	720920	Jeff, can you send me an email?
720920	721920	Would you read the text that I made?
721920	722920	All right.
722920	733080	I, Dan Harmon, love dicks and balls on my head.
733080	734080	That's not gonna fool anybody.
734080	735080	Huh?
735080	736080	They know I'm reading that.
736080	738080	I'm sending you an email right now, too.
738080	739080	Let's see.
739080	742080	It's gonna take a second to send that one.
742080	743080	Oh, yeah.
743080	744080	That might not register right away.
744080	745080	Email's different.
745080	746080	Leave it on.
746080	747080	Okay.
747080	748080	It's...
748080	749080	The wheel's returning here.
749080	750080	I'll hold it up here.
750080	751080	Okay.
751080	752080	All right.
752080	754040	Do you have a Star Trek sound effect?
754040	757960	Yeah, because I can, because I'm free.
757960	758960	You know?
758960	759960	I'm not a slave to Apple.
759960	760960	That should've sent.
760960	761960	Yeah.
761960	762960	Okay.
762960	763960	Well, it doesn't matter.
763960	764960	Just...
764960	765960	Transformers?
765960	766960	Transformers.
766960	767960	Old-school Transformers from the...
767960	768960	Awesome.
768960	769960	From the center of America, too.
769960	770960	All right.
770960	771960	That's it.
771960	772960	Okay.
772960	773960	That's the next item on the list.
773960	774960	You wanna read the...
774960	775960	We're chipping through the...
775960	776960	You're not gonna read the email that I sent you?
776960	777960	All right.
777960	778960	I'll read the email.
778960	780960	That's kind of rude.
781960	782960	All right.
782960	785960	I still love Dixon Ball's.
785960	786960	That's terrific, Jeff.
786960	787960	Here.
787960	788960	Oh!
788960	789960	Motherfucker!
789960	790960	Oh.
790960	791960	I thought there was a rap beat.
791960	792960	I'm sorry.
792960	794960	I didn't know what you were doing.
794960	796960	And it sounded like a rap beat was starting.
796960	799960	Like it was a Motown sample, and then a rap beat was gonna happen.
799960	800960	Okay.
800960	801960	All right.
801960	802960	All right.
802960	803960	All right.
803960	804960	All right.
804960	805960	All right.
805960	806960	All right.
806960	807960	The rap beat was starting.
807960	810960	It was a Motown sample, and then a rap beat was gonna happen.
810960	811960	All right.
811960	814960	Should I have a rap beat queued up?
814960	815960	I guess I should.
815960	816960	I'll wait.
816960	817960	Are you my friend?
817960	818960	Yeah.
818960	819960	The answer is yes.
819960	820960	Fair enough.
820960	821960	Same answer.
821960	822960	All right.
822960	823960	All right.
823960	824960	Next on the list.
824960	825960	Next on the list.
825960	826960	All right.
826960	827960	Holly Berry Burbank Eye.
827960	828960	Okay.
828960	829960	So there's a movie poster.
829960	830960	I guess there's a movie coming out.
830960	833960	Holly Berry's got a headset phone thing out.
833960	837960	And underneath her face is a map of Los Angeles.
837960	840960	And I saw it at a stop light.
840960	841960	It's on a bus stop.
841960	848960	And I guess it's about a 911 dispatcher or something that it says, like, there are 1,800
848960	852200	911 calls every day in Los Angeles.
852200	853800	This one got personal.
853800	856800	And it's Holly Berry's face.
856800	860960	And then underneath her face at half opacity is a map of Los Angeles.
860960	864560	So you see like Santa Monica's by her lip, like a corner of her lip.
864560	866960	But then like right under her eye, it's like Glendale Burbank.
866960	867960	I don't know.
867960	871960	To me, it undercut the severity of the Burbank.
871960	873960	It's a Burbank eye.
873960	879960	Like the Burbank under her eye, your eye goes right to it because it's her eye.
879960	881960	Oh, hey, pretty lady, Burbank.
881960	883960	It's just a dumb town.
883960	887960	I work in Burbank, but it's just a dumb like Burbank.
887960	890960	Like, oh, hey, this one got personal Burbank eye.
890960	893960	It's kind of dumb.
893960	894960	Same department.
894960	895960	Superman poster.
895960	896960	What's going on?
896960	897960	I drove past the Warner Brothers lot.
897960	902960	I saw a poster at Superman and handcuffs with the people, the cops behind them.
902960	903960	Anybody?
903960	905960	Somebody's got to know about this.
905960	907960	So who called out what?
907960	908960	Henry Cabo.
908960	911960	Henry Cabo?
911960	913960	Cabo?
913960	915960	Cabo?
915960	916960	I'm sorry.
916960	917960	This is all gibberish.
917960	920960	Henry Cabot Lodge is playing Superman.
920960	922960	Oh, okay.
922960	927960	Is anyone kind of an in it cool, like, newser that can give us the dope on the Superman movie
927960	929960	that I'm seeing teased on this poster?
929960	931960	Is there anybody here that's...
931960	932960	Well, you know, you can't get...
932960	935960	I'm guessing, sir.
935960	936960	Anybody that actually knows the dope.
936960	938960	Okay, I got a guy raising his...
938960	939960	Can you come up here?
939960	940960	Because the mic won't pick you up.
940960	942960	If you're willing to, it's fine.
942960	944960	What's your name?
944960	945960	Jeremy.
945960	946960	Jeremy, everybody.
946960	948960	Welcome, Jeremy, to the stage.
948960	949960	Hello.
949960	953960	It's the new movie, Man of Steel, that they're working on.
953960	954960	Right.
954960	955960	So it's Man of Steel.
955960	956960	He's a very cool looking Superman.
956960	957960	What's the actor's name?
957960	958960	Henry Cabo.
958960	959960	Henry Cabo.
959960	960960	What's he from?
960960	961960	What's he from?
961960	962960	With a B?
962960	963960	Cowbell?
963960	964960	B.
964960	965960	Cowbell.
965960	966960	Henry Cowbell.
966960	967960	There you go.
967960	968960	Cavill.
968960	969960	Cavill.
969960	970960	Got it.
970960	972960	I got to have more Cavill.
973960	975960	That's so hack.
975960	976960	So hack.
976960	978960	I'm a hack.
978960	984960	As your grandpa at Christmas, I'm asking you kids, why is Henry Cabo exciting?
984960	985960	What was he in?
985960	986960	Interiors.
986960	987960	Interiors?
987960	988960	By Woody Allen?
988960	989960	Immortals.
989960	990960	Wow.
990960	991960	Wow.
991960	992960	He did great in that Woody Allen movie.
992960	993960	Very...
993960	994960	The Tudors.
994960	995960	The Tudors.
995960	996960	Okay.
996960	997960	Wow.
997960	998960	And Immortals.
998960	999960	Okay.
999960	1000960	Tudors and Immortals.
1001960	1003960	Remember when it was just Harrison Ford and three other guys?
1003960	1004960	Yeah.
1004960	1005960	And now it's just like...
1005960	1009960	It's just the barrel is so much whiner and the bottom can be scraped forever.
1010960	1011960	All right.
1015960	1016960	All right.
1016960	1018960	Henry Cabo.
1018960	1020960	So what do you know about the...
1020960	1022960	So he has to...
1022960	1026960	They find out that he's got powers because his dad's always like,
1026960	1028960	Don't show people your powers.
1029960	1030960	His dad?
1030960	1031960	Yeah.
1031960	1032960	Well, you know that Jeff, don't act.
1032960	1033960	His human dad.
1033960	1034960	Jarell?
1034960	1035960	No, his dad...
1035960	1037960	His adoptive father on Smallville.
1037960	1038960	Yeah, yeah.
1038960	1040960	So he...
1041960	1042960	I will clear this courtroom.
1042960	1044960	He goes to the authorities.
1044960	1045960	Right.
1045960	1046960	He's like, I'm an alien.
1046960	1050960	And they're like, well, we've got to process you.
1050960	1053960	Oh, it's about alien, like, immigration law?
1053960	1057960	Well, they're like, he's older and he wants to...
1057960	1058960	He's been hiding.
1058960	1059960	He's been on like...
1059960	1060960	He feels guilty about being...
1060960	1065960	He's been on like Deadliest Catch Boat for like years, hiding the fact that he's Superman.
1065960	1067960	It's a retelling.
1067960	1068960	It's a re...
1068960	1069960	Yeah.
1069960	1070960	Does he fight crime in it?
1070960	1071960	Eventually.
1071960	1074960	Like on page 20 or page 60?
1074960	1075960	Like act two.
1075960	1076960	Have you seen it?
1076960	1077960	Is it out in theaters?
1077960	1078960	How do you know?
1078960	1080960	The really long trailers and it's been around.
1080960	1082960	They've been talking about it for a while.
1082960	1084960	Are you excited about it?
1084960	1086960	I'm going to see it because I like superhero movies.
1086960	1087960	Yeah.
1087960	1090960	But are you a Superman guy or are you like Batman guy?
1090960	1091960	Actually, 90s Superman.
1091960	1093960	I know a lot of...
1093960	1094960	What does that mean?
1094960	1095960	Small little...
1095960	1097960	90s to 2000 comics.
1097960	1100960	In the comics, they actually made Superman appealing?
1100960	1101960	Yeah, yeah.
1101960	1102960	You know what?
1102960	1103960	I just found out about Superman.
1103960	1105960	I never understood the appeal of Superman.
1105960	1106960	I never got it.
1106960	1108960	Like, what does it mean?
1108960	1110960	You have Batman, we have Spider-Man, you can see the appeal.
1110960	1111960	Granted, all these things came after Superman.
1111960	1114960	We developed the idea of a Superman.
1114960	1117960	And then everything else is a commentary after that.
1117960	1119960	If you watch Easy Writer and you don't like it,
1119960	1121960	you can't necessarily say Easy Writer is a bad movie
1121960	1124960	because so much shit was influenced by this weird...
1124960	1126960	Dennis Hopper is high and he's got a camera.
1126960	1128960	But Superman...
1128960	1130960	I didn't know this about the history of it.
1130960	1135960	It was created by two Jewish brothers, I think.
1135960	1136960	And they were like...
1136960	1140960	During the time when Jewish people were incredibly feeling like,
1140960	1141960	what is wrong with us?
1141960	1143960	Why does this keep happening?
1144960	1147960	Should I start feeling bad about myself officially?
1147960	1151960	And they created this character that was like...
1151960	1153960	They should have put a little super hat on his head
1153960	1157960	and had him be able to throw it and decapitate Nazis and stuff.
1157960	1159960	A super yarmulke?
1159960	1161960	Because I never got it.
1161960	1163960	But they were expressing...
1163960	1165960	Maybe that is the...
1165960	1167960	When we do keep Superman around,
1167960	1169960	maybe we're all feeling that, like,
1169960	1171960	fuck you, you know, just that one impulse.
1171960	1173960	I'm like, fuck you, fuck you.
1173960	1175960	Like that. That makes me like him.
1175960	1177960	Other than that, I'm like, what the fuck are you?
1177960	1180960	Like, even in the movie, he loses his powers,
1180960	1181960	he gets beat up in a truck step,
1181960	1183960	and then that whole movie is supposed to be the coolest Superman movie
1183960	1186960	and then he goes back in the end and beats the shit out of a truck driver.
1186960	1187960	It's the worst.
1187960	1191960	To me, growing up, lower middle class in Wisconsin,
1191960	1193960	Batman I like because my fantasy is,
1193960	1195960	I want to be rich and if I was rich,
1195960	1197960	I wouldn't fuck around with my money.
1197960	1199960	I'd use it to fight crime.
1199960	1201960	Like, I would make a super car
1201960	1203960	and I'd have cameras everywhere and I'd go out
1203960	1205960	and I'd kick some ass.
1205960	1207960	Yeah, sure.
1207960	1209960	And Spider-Man 2 is the same thing.
1209960	1211960	Like, you're a teenager, you find out you're talented
1211960	1213960	and then how do you deal with it?
1213960	1215960	The answer is, wisecracking, you know?
1215960	1217960	You get out there, but Superman was always like,
1217960	1219960	oh, you're born special, boo-hoo.
1219960	1223960	Jerk off in a cup, pour it on your head.
1223960	1226960	That's his weakness.
1226960	1229960	Oh, his own cum touches him and he's like,
1229960	1232960	oh, I'm my own worst enemy.
1232960	1234960	When you remind me where I'm from,
1234960	1237960	I start to get weak.
1237960	1238960	It's so dumb.
1238960	1240960	It's just so dumb.
1240960	1245960	But the Jew thing really lifts it up.
1245960	1248960	That's the dash of pepper that every omelet needs.
1248960	1253960	This needs a little gritty fucking, yeah.
1253960	1255960	There's a lot of human emotion there.
1255960	1257960	They should have put that on the cover.
1257960	1259960	Superman and then the subheading,
1259960	1263960	like an expression of Jewish rage.
1263960	1266960	And then I'd be like, oh, shit, this is valuable.
1266960	1270960	Like that mouse comic.
1270960	1271960	Like, go valuable.
1271960	1274960	If I don't like this, I'm a bad person, you know?
1274960	1276960	Like, this is important culturally.
1276960	1278960	Sorry, what was your name, Vest?
1278960	1279960	Jeremy.
1279960	1281960	He's wearing a vest.
1281960	1282960	I don't know why I said that.
1282960	1285960	Stupid.
1285960	1287960	All right, I got a lot of shit to get through.
1287960	1288960	Stay there, Jeremy.
1288960	1290960	You're going to help me.
1290960	1293960	Holly Berry Burbank Eye Superman poster.
1293960	1295960	All right, all right.
1295960	1298960	Actually, you don't watch The Bachelor, do you?
1298960	1299960	No.
1299960	1304960	Okay, well, the guy dumped the girl with one arm, apparently.
1304960	1308960	If you're not caught up, sorry.
1308960	1311960	Dan, aren't you supposed to be writing scripts right now
1311960	1312960	for various networks?
1312960	1314960	Well, I'm on a fucking stage.
1314960	1315960	What are you talking about?
1315960	1317960	Oh, I was just watching a lot of TV, man.
1317960	1318960	Oh, no, no.
1318960	1319960	Erin tells me.
1319960	1321960	Erin opens the window and I'm in the backyard writing my thing
1321960	1325960	and she goes, he's dumping the girl with one arm.
1325960	1327960	Get in here.
1327960	1328960	She's right to do that.
1328960	1329960	It's like, this is history.
1329960	1330960	How do you do that?
1330960	1332960	How do you dump a one-armed girl?
1332960	1335960	They should have called The Bachelor this season.
1335960	1337960	The Bachelor, season 25.
1337960	1341960	How do you dump a one-armed girl?
1341960	1343960	That's a good question.
1343960	1344960	Again, like the Superman thing.
1344960	1349960	Come clean about what's really powering your myth, you know?
1349960	1352960	All I'm seeing is a guy in a cape jumping around
1352960	1353960	and he can do anything.
1353960	1357960	Tell me it's about being a Jew.
1357960	1360960	You're a complicated fellow, Dan.
1360960	1361960	All right, okay.
1361960	1362960	Wait, Alex?
1362960	1363960	Jeremy.
1363960	1369960	Christ.
1369960	1370960	No, wait.
1370960	1371960	Watch this, Jeff.
1371960	1372960	Watch this.
1372960	1373960	Should I get a name tag?
1373960	1374960	If you wanted to be named anything, what would it be?
1374960	1376960	Well, I like my name, so.
1376960	1377960	Ah, shit.
1377960	1379960	I just thought maybe.
1379960	1380960	All right.
1380960	1383960	Sometimes I feel like when I do that, God's working through me.
1383960	1384960	Jeremy.
1384960	1385960	Then sometimes I'm just bad with names.
1385960	1388960	Jeremy, the ghost poop law is in effect.
1388960	1389960	Yeah.
1389960	1390960	Whose pants do you poop?
1390960	1392960	Whose pants do you poop if you drop dead to me?
1392960	1393960	One of the high school boys.
1393960	1394960	Really?
1394960	1395960	What's his name?
1395960	1396960	What's his name?
1396960	1399960	I'd have to narrow it down for that.
1399960	1401960	What you have to, you're dying.
1401960	1403960	Gene Hackman's asking you.
1403960	1406960	First of all, who's your poop mentor?
1406960	1407960	Poop mentor?
1407960	1409960	Yeah, who's your Gene Hackman?
1409960	1410960	Christopher Walken.
1410960	1411960	Christopher Walken comes in, right?
1411960	1413960	Christopher Walken comes down.
1413960	1416960	And Jeff, he says what?
1416960	1419960	He says, hi.
1419960	1421960	You're dead.
1421960	1422960	Sorry.
1422960	1425960	He's so young.
1425960	1430960	Nice vest.
1430960	1435960	Have you seen that Superman movie?
1435960	1440960	I've got to have more cavil.
1440960	1441960	Sorry.
1441960	1444960	That's even hack for me.
1444960	1447960	Who do you want to poop?
1447960	1450960	Who do you want to poop?
1450960	1451960	Who are you going to poop?
1451960	1452960	Yeah.
1452960	1459960	Whose pants do you want to fill with poo?
1459960	1460960	It's your right.
1460960	1463960	It's a dead person.
1463960	1466960	Tick tock.
1466960	1469960	I'm a pretty popular poop mentor.
1469960	1472960	But also you have 10 minutes to ask Christopher Walken anything.
1472960	1478960	Ask him any question you want.
1478960	1479960	Put on the spot.
1479960	1480960	It'd be so difficult.
1480960	1481960	It's all right.
1481960	1482960	Yeah.
1482960	1483960	Are you of legal drinking age?
1483960	1484960	Oh, yeah.
1484960	1485960	Do you want to Ivanka?
1485960	1486960	Yes.
1486960	1487960	There you go.
1487960	1488960	That's your prize for coming up.
1488960	1489960	Cool.
1489960	1490960	Come on.
1490960	1491960	Jeremy, whose pants do you poop?
1491960	1492960	Let's see.
1492960	1495960	We got a lot of shit to get to in the show.
1495960	1496960	Chris.
1496960	1497960	Huh?
1497960	1498960	Chris.
1498960	1499960	Chris.
1499960	1500960	He's a high school bully?
1500960	1501960	He was.
1501960	1502960	Yeah.
1502960	1503960	Typically.
1503960	1504960	What's your memory of Chris?
1504960	1505960	What did he do to you?
1505960	1506960	Well, one of the...
1506960	1507960	Actually, no.
1507960	1508960	I'll switch it.
1508960	1509960	Justin.
1509960	1510960	Justin Thomas.
1510960	1511960	Ooh.
1511960	1512960	Ooh.
1512960	1514960	You can bleep that out.
1514960	1516960	He sent him out.
1516960	1517960	No, no, no.
1517960	1518960	Justin Thomas.
1518960	1519960	What did he do?
1519960	1520960	What did he do?
1520960	1521960	One memory.
1521960	1522960	Regular, weekly, he would...
1522960	1527960	If I had to leave the classroom, he would flip my bag inside out, but my bag's always...
1527960	1528960	What does it mean?
1528960	1529960	Like a book bag or a backpack?
1529960	1530960	Yeah.
1530960	1531960	A book bag.
1531960	1532960	It's a...
1532960	1536600	It's a weird thing that they figured out how to do is they take your book bag and they
1536600	1540780	empty it and then they turn it inside out and put all your stuff back in, except I
1540780	1544760	always had a lot of stuff like papers and whatever in my bag.
1544760	1548760	So the first time he tried it, he just didn't bother putting it all back in.
1548760	1549760	Right.
1549760	1550760	Of course not.
1550760	1551760	He flipped it inside out.
1551760	1552760	He was like, oh, this is a lot more work than...
1552760	1553760	Yeah.
1553760	1554760	Then I'm signing it on board.
1554760	1555760	Wait.
1555760	1556760	So then what happened?
1556760	1557760	You got an inside out book bag?
1557760	1558760	Yeah.
1558760	1562840	And then you shut with all your stuff in it, so then you have to then undo it and put
1562840	1564240	your all stuff back in.
1564240	1565240	Right.
1565240	1566240	So yeah.
1566240	1567240	Regularly.
1567240	1568240	Did he ever like...
1568240	1569240	Did he ever get beat up or anything?
1569240	1572880	He attempted it once and then he didn't try that anymore.
1572880	1573880	Uh-oh.
1573880	1577440	Well, what...
1577440	1580640	Most people don't like lunch boxes going at their heads.
1580640	1582840	You hit them with a lunch box?
1582840	1585440	So it sounds like you had a pretty easy experience.
1585440	1586440	Eventually.
1586440	1588560	It almost sounds like you're a bully.
1589360	1590360	Eventually.
1590360	1594120	It sounds like Justin Thomas is going to shit your pants when he does.
1594120	1596920	I'm sure he's got a lot more people to deal with than...
1596920	1597920	Probably.
1597920	1598920	Yeah.
1598920	1599920	So it was just torment.
1599920	1600920	It was just that...
1600920	1601920	Yeah.
1601920	1602920	It was just constant, like...
1602920	1603920	Yeah.
1603920	1604920	Annoying stuff.
1604920	1605920	All right.
1605920	1606920	Was he a big guy?
1606920	1607920	No.
1607920	1608920	That was probably why.
1608920	1609920	Of course.
1609920	1610920	Yeah.
1610920	1611920	Yeah.
1611920	1612920	The little guys were the worst.
1612920	1613920	Yeah.
1613920	1614920	They were big guys who were abusing their authority, but then you'd go, clean me alone
1614920	1616920	and they'd go, you're all right.
1616920	1617920	Yeah.
1618280	1619280	Dumb.
1619280	1620280	Fucking...
1620280	1621280	All assholes.
1621280	1622280	All of you.
1622280	1625480	But then the little guy would be like, yeah, he's the guy that's going to bring an exacto
1625480	1626480	blade to school.
1626480	1628480	He's a fucking little guy.
1628480	1629480	This is dead.
1629480	1633240	Burned him with a cigarette and it's your problem all of a sudden.
1633240	1635520	It's the worst.
1635520	1638960	But you know the great thing is, you go to your 10-year reunion, all of those guys just
1638960	1642640	drank antifreeze and died.
1642640	1644200	I went to my 20-year reunion.
1644200	1650320	If you make it that far, they all blow each other up in cars and go to prison and stuff.
1650320	1654520	Whatever happened to the five assholes that I hated the most, oh, two of them went to
1654520	1657640	prison, three of them ratted on each other and then one of them got out and blew the
1657640	1659360	other one up.
1659360	1660360	It's just great.
1660360	1661360	You just...
1661360	1662360	So I don't have to do anything.
1662360	1663400	There is no revenge fantasy.
1663400	1667480	They just kill each other, like bacteria in your teeth or something.
1667480	1668480	All right.
1668480	1670760	Thank you, Alex, John, whatever your name is.
1670760	1673760	Jeremy, everyone.
1673760	1675760	Thanks for opening up.
1675760	1680640	Boy, it sounds like that Superman movie is...
1680640	1685360	Now that the jury's out, let's check back in with that Superman movie in a week after
1685360	1686360	we...
1686360	1687360	Let's get some more things.
1687360	1688360	All right.
1688360	1689360	Next item on our list.
1689360	1691360	You're familiar with Adam Goldberg, right?
1691360	1692360	Slightly.
1692360	1693360	Yeah.
1693360	1694360	Yeah, yeah.
1694360	1696360	Somebody in the front row just went, God damn it.
1696360	1697360	Oh, it's Adam.
1697360	1698360	Okay.
1698360	1699360	Wait.
1699360	1700360	I don't see Adam in the front row.
1700360	1701360	Oh, there he is.
1701360	1702360	Okay.
1702360	1703360	All right.
1703960	1707240	One of his moves, he gives you things, and then he asks for them back.
1707240	1711360	He gives you a plate of brownies, and he goes, I want the plate back.
1711360	1712360	This is my speculation.
1712360	1717360	He read about it in some book about Joe Rogan's guide to getting laid or something.
1717360	1719360	I don't know.
1719360	1720360	Give him something.
1720360	1721360	Here's a t-shirt.
1721360	1722360	And then you got...
1722360	1727240	It's like the old gag of the old 80s sexist gag of like, oh, they'll leave a purse at
1727240	1730320	your house on the woman's side of the gun.
1730320	1731320	Give him a thing.
1731320	1732320	Oh, is there a handkerchief?
1732320	1736840	Hey, can I get that handkerchief back so I can talk to you and dig my paws into you
1736840	1737920	just for a second?
1737920	1742360	So Goldberg gave me a box of a game called Citadel's.
1742360	1746080	It's like a role-playing game of some kind, some kind of thing.
1746080	1747320	And I have it here.
1747320	1748520	I'm going to give it back to him.
1748520	1749520	That's it.
1749520	1750520	We'll just knock it off our list.
1750520	1751520	Okay?
1751520	1757000	Adam, could you please come up and receive your...
1757000	1758000	We'll edit this out.
1758000	1759000	Yeah.
1760000	1762000	Now, you got to come up and you got to...
1762000	1765000	This is kind of like you breaking up with the one-armed lady.
1767000	1769000	There's reverse psychology back at you.
1769000	1770000	You got the mic.
1770000	1772000	Adam, here's your box of Citadel's.
1772000	1773000	Thank you.
1773000	1775000	Have a great week.
1775000	1777000	Adam Goldberg, everybody.
1780000	1781000	All right.
1781000	1782000	Shed no tears for him.
1782000	1784000	All right.
1784000	1785000	Moving down the list.
1785000	1786000	All right.
1786000	1788000	You're getting good at this, man.
1788000	1789000	That's...
1789000	1790000	Yeah, yeah.
1790000	1792000	My phone gets bigger and bigger and I can keep a longer list.
1792000	1794000	And yeah, I texted you earlier.
1794000	1795000	You're at a bar.
1795000	1796000	And I texted you.
1796000	1798000	You said, we're at the pikey before the show.
1798000	1801000	I said, order me a Sam Smith logger and a Fernet Bronco.
1801000	1802000	And I'm walking up.
1802000	1803000	And I get there.
1803000	1804000	I said, did you order?
1804000	1805000	He's like, no.
1805000	1811000	His giant 11 by 9 phone is on the bar, on the table in front of him.
1811000	1812000	It's still nothing.
1812000	1815000	I was probably talking to somebody or something about, you know...
1816000	1818000	Is BJ here?
1818000	1819000	BJ?
1819000	1820000	Okay.
1820000	1821000	I have his phone.
1821000	1822000	Sorry.
1822000	1823000	All right.
1823000	1824000	Knock that off the list.
1824000	1825000	You're just breaking up with everybody now.
1825000	1826000	Yeah.
1826000	1827000	I'm making amends, Jeff.
1827000	1829000	After tonight's show, I walk off stage.
1829000	1831000	And then you just hear a single gunshot.
1831000	1833000	And then it's like...
1833000	1835000	That was the most amazing show.
1835000	1837000	And then all of a sudden I...
1837000	1838000	Oh, shit.
1838000	1840000	Those pants are full of poop.
1840000	1842000	You son of a bitch.
1842000	1844000	And then Adam goes through his pile of poop
1844000	1846000	and he pulls out the five of diamonds.
1847000	1848000	Is this your car?
1850000	1851000	All right.
1851000	1852000	Bachelor One Arm Girl.
1852000	1853000	All right.
1853000	1854000	Ryan Ridley couldn't be here tonight.
1854000	1855000	He's on a date tonight.
1857000	1858000	I want to...
1858000	1859000	I want to bring...
1859000	1861000	It's like a Three's Company episode.
1862000	1864000	I want to bring him up next week
1864000	1866000	because I want to ask him how this date went.
1866000	1867000	That's not cool.
1867000	1868000	What do you mean?
1868000	1869000	I don't know.
1869000	1871000	It's personal shit, man.
1871000	1872000	All right.
1872000	1873000	Bring him up.
1873000	1874000	No, he's not here.
1874000	1875000	I don't know.
1875000	1876000	Next week.
1876000	1877000	Let's see.
1877000	1878000	Tonight's date is...
1878000	1879000	He's going on a date with a girl who...
1879000	1880000	Is that big news?
1880000	1882000	Is he kind of unlucky with the ladies?
1882000	1883000	It's big news for him.
1883000	1884000	Yeah, yeah.
1884000	1885000	No, he's an active dater.
1885000	1886000	He dates.
1886000	1888000	He dates more than I ever have.
1888000	1889000	He dates.
1889000	1891000	He's part of the single scene.
1891000	1895000	He's going on a date tonight with a girl that...
1895000	1897000	She said that...
1897000	1899000	They were trying to decide what to do for their first date.
1899000	1900000	And she said,
1900000	1904000	I want to infiltrate a cult.
1904000	1909000	And I immediately kind of came down and I was like...
1909000	1912000	Manic pixie dream girl kind of thing.
1912000	1913000	You know, Amelie.
1913000	1914000	Like, I don't know.
1914000	1915000	Just like, let's have fun.
1915000	1916000	Let's have a hell of a bottom carter.
1916000	1918000	Face Fight Club, you know.
1918000	1919000	Let's go.
1919000	1921000	Let's go wreak havoc.
1921000	1922000	Does she understand?
1922000	1924000	Like, my first date with Erin,
1924000	1927000	we had a drink at 11 a.m. at the drawing room.
1927000	1928000	That's why I love her.
1928000	1929000	I'm going to be with her forever
1929000	1931000	because it's like, you're sitting there, you have a drink.
1931000	1933000	Like, guess what?
1933000	1936000	Being in love with him, he's going to be like, you know?
1936000	1938000	You like this?
1938000	1941000	Welcome to 20 years, you know?
1941000	1942000	Like, that's me.
1942000	1943000	I'm 40.
1943000	1945000	But Ryan's still out there playing the field.
1945000	1946000	So it's like, let's go.
1946000	1947000	You know what I want to do?
1947000	1950000	I want to take a pumpkin and sell it to a gourd.
1950000	1951000	Let's just...
1951000	1954000	Let's culture jam.
1954000	1956000	Let's go to a laundromat and take the clothes.
1956000	1957000	Put it on her head.
1957000	1958000	The guy comes in.
1958000	1961000	Let's have no cameras there, but be punked.
1961000	1962000	You know?
1962000	1965000	Like, punk people and be Tom Green and...
1965000	1967000	A cult would be an awesome thing if the poop thing happened
1967000	1969000	because you could get a bunch of people to all poop
1969000	1971000	the same guy's pants.
1971000	1972000	Yeah, you could.
1972000	1975000	The yogic fliers hovering over L.A.
1975000	1977000	focused the poop.
1977000	1980000	Like, the real genius laser, you just target things.
1980000	1983000	Remote viewing poop people.
1983000	1987000	The president was unable to sign the anti-poverty bill today
1987000	1990000	because so much poop was in his pants that he couldn't reach the pants.
1990000	1992000	Yeah, what happens...
1992000	1994000	What happens if you're an unpopular president,
1994000	1996000	a bunch of people die in an unpopular war,
1996000	2000000	and is it one shit after the other, or does it just compound?
2000000	2004000	If 400 people die in a bomb and have been a building
2004000	2007000	and then exploded because of some sort of policy
2007000	2011000	and they all poop the president's pants, is it 400 turds at once?
2011000	2012000	Yes, yes, yes.
2012000	2013000	So it's just shit everywhere.
2013000	2014000	So everyone...
2014000	2015000	So, yes.
2015000	2019000	When you go to the White House, all you see is a giant pile of shit.
2019000	2020000	Always.
2020000	2022000	Like, you don't even see the White House
2022000	2024000	unless the government starts shaping up
2024000	2026000	and starts representing the people so well
2026000	2030000	that their poop doesn't eclipse the ivory...
2030000	2033000	But nobody would run for president because even if you won...
2033000	2035000	Exactly, exactly.
2035000	2040000	No one would run for president because it's a thankless shitty job.
2040000	2042000	Because it's supposed to be.
2042000	2044000	Because you're running everything.
2044000	2046000	You make the trains run on time.
2046000	2048000	You make sure everyone's happy.
2048000	2050000	Unless you have a passion for doing that...
2050000	2052000	Or a passion for sitting in a lot of people's shit.
2052000	2056000	Well, yeah, I guess maybe the random oddball.
2056000	2059000	I'd be like, vote for me.
2059000	2062000	I'm probably going to do a lot wrong.
2062000	2064000	I know.
2064000	2067000	I know you, Turdie McGee.
2067000	2070000	There's only so many of those.
2070000	2073000	I'm from the Hustler Party.
2073000	2075000	Swimming in poop.
2075000	2077000	But other than that, you'd be like...
2077000	2079000	You'd have civil servant types going,
2079000	2081000	Look, I get it. You're going to poop on me.
2081000	2083000	You're going to poop in my pants.
2083000	2085000	Every day I'm going to have to deal with this poop everywhere.
2085000	2087000	And I'm going to be surrounded by people
2087000	2089000	who have to deal with the stench of poop.
2089000	2091000	When they come in, it's not a glamorous job.
2091000	2093000	If you want power and you want romance,
2093000	2096000	you don't get into politics that way.
2096000	2098000	You keep all of those people,
2098000	2101000	all of those shitty people out of the business
2101000	2103000	and putting in an actual shitty business,
2103000	2106000	all of those people then go into model railroads or something.
2106000	2108000	All of a sudden it just deflects into...
2108000	2111000	Model railroads become a billion dollar industry.
2111000	2113000	If you can make a perfect little train,
2113000	2116000	let all the hobby shops be powerful.
2116000	2118000	Let there be lines outside of them
2118000	2119000	and people are just swaggering,
2119000	2121000	You want to get in this hobby shop?
2121000	2123000	No one can figure it out.
2123000	2125000	Let it be pointlessly point full.
2125000	2126000	Fuck that.
2126000	2129000	And then the actual places where you're running the government
2129000	2132000	and people are just trying to keep the level of shit down
2132000	2135000	by not fucking up everything all the time.
2135000	2137000	It's just a working theory, Jeff.
2137000	2141000	It hinges on this weird spiritual teleportation of shit thing
2141000	2144000	and also like an afterlife and kind of thing.
2144000	2148000	There might be a way to replicate the effect of holograms.
2148000	2150000	It's just something to keep in mind
2150000	2152000	when we start our moon base on the moon.
2152000	2154000	Bring it back to the old original idea.
2154000	2156000	To our lost thesis.
2156000	2158000	I don't know how you got me on that topic,
2158000	2159000	but that was Ryan Really's date.
2159000	2161000	We got three things left, okay?
2161000	2162000	All right.
2162000	2163000	No, two things.
2163000	2165000	I jerked off today at work.
2165000	2168000	Wait.
2168000	2171000	Your office is nothing but glass.
2171000	2172000	It's all windows.
2172000	2174000	It's a secret bathroom.
2174000	2176000	I had to.
2176000	2178000	I'm telling you and Aaron at the same time
2178000	2182000	because I have to stay on the same page
2182000	2183000	and stay transparent about it.
2183000	2185000	Because I had like three weeks ago,
2185000	2187000	if you recall,
2187000	2190000	I stopped because it was getting in the way of my work.
2190000	2192000	This was your first masturbation after the...
2192000	2193000	Yeah, yeah.
2193000	2194000	Here's the thing.
2194000	2197000	Like last couple days, like I...
2197000	2198000	You didn't masturbate for three weeks?
2198000	2199000	Yeah.
2199000	2200000	Totally wrong.
2200000	2201000	Thank you.
2201000	2202000	You're welcome.
2202000	2203000	Thank you, everybody.
2203000	2204000	Thank you.
2204000	2205000	And you're welcome.
2205000	2206000	So that must have been a doozy.
2206000	2207000	I did it.
2207000	2208000	Not really, no?
2208000	2209000	That's the weird thing.
2209000	2210000	It wasn't like,
2210000	2211000	Ho, ho, ho, Hoover Dam.
2211000	2213000	It wasn't.
2213000	2214000	It was kind of like what it was.
2214000	2215000	It was like sneezing or something.
2215000	2216000	It was like,
2216000	2217000	All right.
2217000	2218000	And that's why I had to do it.
2218000	2219000	Because I felt like...
2219000	2221000	I kind of felt like a weird...
2221000	2222000	It wasn't like...
2222000	2224000	You know, when you're doing it eight times a day,
2224000	2225000	it's like a weird compulsive thing.
2225000	2227000	Like you're addicted to the dopamine in your brain
2227000	2228000	that's generated by,
2228000	2229000	Oh, this is my comfort.
2229000	2230000	This is like eating macaroni and cheese.
2230000	2234000	It's a different thing than when you're like...
2234000	2235000	Finally, you're like,
2235000	2239000	I feel like I have a bag of concrete in my pants
2239000	2242000	and I just go in the bathroom.
2242000	2243000	You know?
2243000	2244000	I don't know.
2244000	2246000	I'm learning at the same time as you are.
2246000	2249000	You made that a lot less sexy than it could have been.
2249000	2251000	No, I can't.
2251000	2252000	It's not a sexy thing.
2252000	2254000	But I'm confessing.
2254000	2256000	I ended my three week streak.
2256000	2258000	But it was a biological imperative.
2258000	2261000	I felt like I was going to get prostate cancer.
2261000	2263000	Because I hadn't...
2263000	2265000	You know, Aaron had been kind of sidelined
2265000	2266000	for the last three days
2266000	2268000	because I'm working really hard to finish the script.
2268000	2269000	And so I was like,
2269000	2271000	I'm staying up all night and then I'm going to bed.
2271000	2272000	I'm exhausted.
2272000	2274000	The end result of that was like three days
2274000	2276000	of I'm not doing anything.
2276000	2278000	And then I'm sitting at the office today.
2278000	2281000	I'm like, I think I'm going to get cancer from...
2281000	2282000	Which is an urban legend,
2282000	2284000	but also I couldn't stop thinking about it.
2284000	2287000	And I was like, I feel... I'm in pain.
2287000	2289000	I'm just going to go and...
2289000	2290000	You might have saved your own life.
2290000	2292000	Yeah.
2292000	2293000	So I did it.
2293000	2294000	I apologize, America,
2294000	2295000	but I'm right back on the wagon.
2295000	2297000	And that's like...
2297000	2298000	I'm sorry.
2298000	2299000	That's your update.
2299000	2300000	All right.
2300000	2301000	Last thing on the list.
2301000	2302000	Last thing.
2302000	2303000	Real Abed's here again.
2303000	2304000	Oh, yeah.
2304000	2309000	This is a smattering of applause.
2309000	2313000	But an enthusiastic small portion of our crowd.
2313000	2315000	Seven people really were into that.
2315000	2319000	I saw him in the green room.
2319000	2320000	I saw him in the green room
2320000	2323000	and he had a little brown paper bag,
2323000	2327000	so I wanted to start a new segment called
2327000	2329000	What did Abed buy at the comic book store.
2329000	2330000	All right.
2330000	2332000	So let's bring up real Abed.
2332000	2333000	Abed Gaeth.
2338000	2339000	Abed Gaeth, everyone.
2339000	2340000	Hello.
2340000	2341000	How are you, man?
2341000	2342000	Good to see you.
2342000	2344000	Hey, man.
2344000	2347000	No, first of all, last week was super fun.
2347000	2348000	It was like really fun.
2348000	2350000	When's the last time you jerked off, Abed?
2350000	2353000	Like two days ago, maybe.
2353000	2355000	See, I can't jerk off either, actually,
2355000	2357000	because I live with my brother now.
2357000	2360000	And if I jerked off in the same house as him, right?
2360000	2361000	It's weird.
2361000	2362000	That's a sin, right?
2362000	2363000	Well, it's just weird.
2363000	2365000	It's like kind of like you need to be alone.
2365000	2367000	What if you jerk off and there's a room full of animators
2367000	2368000	outside the bathroom door?
2368000	2369000	That's even worse.
2369000	2370000	Oh, OK.
2370000	2371000	That's worse.
2371000	2373000	Although I have jerked off at work before in the past.
2373000	2374000	I'll see you in hell.
2374000	2375000	And it's only because at the time,
2375000	2377000	I can't remember, like you said, like you felt you had cancer.
2377000	2379000	I was like, something's wrong with me.
2379000	2380000	I got it. Yeah.
2380000	2382000	And it's not even that joyful.
2382000	2383000	Yeah, it's like you have to do it.
2383000	2385000	If I had waited one more day,
2385000	2387000	I might have had one of those legendary wet dreams
2387000	2390000	they taught us about in our 1950s-inspired,
2390000	2392000	1980s sex ed classes.
2392000	2393000	Yeah, yeah.
2393000	2394000	I had the same class.
2394000	2395000	I used to tell you about wet dreams
2395000	2397000	and everyone in the 80s would be like,
2397000	2398000	wet dreams?
2398000	2399000	How does that happen?
2399000	2401000	But it was like they only knew wet dreams existed
2401000	2402000	because in the 50s,
2402000	2404000	people actually didn't jerk off for a while.
2404000	2408000	I thought wet dreams was like when you just piss your pants.
2408000	2410000	That's what I thought as a kid.
2410000	2413000	And then later found out it was like the other thing.
2413000	2414000	And I was really disturbed.
2414000	2415000	I was like, whoa.
2415000	2416000	I've never had a wet dream.
2416000	2418000	I don't think I ever ate either.
2418000	2420000	I've had very, very like...
2420000	2421000	Is this like an accidental jerk off?
2421000	2422000	Is that what happens?
2422000	2424000	Yeah, it's a nocturnal emission.
2424000	2426000	Like you just come in your dream.
2426000	2427000	Well, do you like rub against something
2427000	2429000	or is it just like your dream makes you go like,
2429000	2431000	oh, and then like you have a...
2431000	2432000	No, yeah.
2432000	2434000	Theoretically, you ejaculate.
2434000	2435000	This is doing shit to me.
2435000	2437000	You're dreaming about, you know,
2437000	2439000	you're hanging out and you're playing badminton
2439000	2440000	with Nicole Kidman in your dream
2440000	2441000	and then she, you know,
2441000	2443000	and then something happens.
2443000	2444000	And then in your dream,
2444000	2446000	your body doesn't move in your dream,
2446000	2448000	otherwise that would be sleepwalking or whatever.
2448000	2449000	So you're just sitting there.
2449000	2452000	But then ostensibly, I don't...
2452000	2454000	I believe the scientists, they say this happens,
2454000	2456000	that you're dreaming in your dream.
2456000	2458000	You're like, hey, Nicole Kidman coming for some lemonade.
2458000	2460000	And she's like, hey, I love lemonade.
2460000	2461000	I'm really grateful for it.
2461000	2463000	And you're like, it's the best I can make.
2463000	2465000	I mean, it's fresh lemons.
2465000	2467000	And she's like, look, I feel like I owe you.
2467000	2468000	I don't have any money.
2468000	2470000	And you're like, well, look, you don't owe me anything.
2470000	2471000	You're a guest at my house.
2471000	2472000	It's a badminton tournament.
2472000	2474000	And then she's like...
2474000	2475000	And then she does something.
2475000	2476000	And then the next thing you know,
2476000	2478000	like, you wake up and you know...
2478000	2479000	It's never happened to me.
2479000	2480000	Like, you know...
2480000	2481000	Yeah, it's never happened to me either.
2481000	2482000	I actually ejaculate in your sleep.
2482000	2484000	I can't believe with an imagination like that
2484000	2487000	that you stopped masturbating for three weeks.
2487000	2488000	I'm sorry.
2488000	2489000	Well, you know...
2489000	2490000	This is some heavy shit, man.
2490000	2491000	Why did you stop actually?
2491000	2492000	What was the reason?
2492000	2493000	Because I was trying to...
2493000	2496000	I looked at the facts and I was like,
2496000	2500000	I am doing two things less than...
2500000	2501000	I am writing...
2501000	2503000	Like, I'm not getting enough writing done.
2503000	2505000	And I talked to Duncan Trussell and he was like,
2505000	2507000	yeah, it's like, is there something tied to this?
2507000	2509000	You know, it's not about self-denial.
2509000	2512000	It's about like, what are we really doing when we do this?
2512000	2514000	And I noticed, like, when I have a deadline,
2514000	2515000	when I'm supposed to be writing,
2515000	2517000	I break world records.
2517000	2518000	Like, it's not even...
2518000	2521000	There's nothing happening down there.
2521000	2524000	But I'm compulsively doing this thing
2524000	2526000	because I'm trying not to write
2526000	2528000	because I'll do anything other than write.
2528000	2529000	Right, yeah.
2529000	2530000	And then you have a million other things,
2530000	2532000	like you check your Twitter and blah, blah, blah.
2532000	2535000	But one of the biggest things that can really put a dent in everything...
2535000	2536000	I just...
2536000	2538000	It's like, if you eliminate this artificially,
2538000	2540000	then if we close that door to that wing of the house,
2540000	2543000	let's see what happens in the other wings.
2543000	2545000	Well, you know, the thing that's weird for me when you say that is,
2545000	2547000	like, it never got in my way, really.
2547000	2549000	It just...
2549000	2551000	It's more mechanical, it's like, okay, I got to go do this
2551000	2553000	and then I'll get back to what I was doing.
2553000	2555000	Well, congratulations.
2555000	2558000	I mean, that comes from, like, years of being single.
2558000	2560000	It just became normal to me.
2560000	2562000	But anyway, I still think it's normal.
2562000	2564000	Humblebrag, I guess. I don't know.
2564000	2566000	I mean, I feel like...
2566000	2568000	It's something to do with writing.
2568000	2570000	Like, I could fill a dixie cup.
2570000	2573000	Like, if someone told me,
2573000	2576000	you have to turn in a movie by next Wednesday,
2576000	2578000	I would, like...
2578000	2579000	If I don't...
2579000	2580000	That's quite a movie.
2580000	2583000	It's just a murmur of dissatisfaction going to the crowd.
2583000	2586000	They don't like the visual, but guess what?
2586000	2588000	I'm not asking this to be gross, but...
2588000	2590000	It's only a question.
2590000	2592000	Are there women out there that do that too, as compulsively as guys?
2592000	2594000	You have a task or you're writing?
2594000	2595000	They're not going to applaud.
2595000	2596000	Good question.
2596000	2597000	I don't know. Nobody?
2597000	2598000	Aaron McGathey's one.
2598000	2600000	You? Yeah?
2600000	2602000	You masturbate quite a bit when you got...
2602000	2604000	Did you procrastinate and masturbate?
2604000	2605000	No.
2605000	2607000	Procrasturbate, I think they're called.
2607000	2609000	Title of the episode.
2609000	2610000	I don't know. It's a correlation.
2610000	2611000	No?
2611000	2613000	You just masturbate all the time, anyway.
2613000	2614000	You know what? I'm sorry.
2615000	2616000	There's playing video games.
2616000	2617000	There's eating ice cream.
2617000	2618000	There's masturbation.
2618000	2620000	There's checking your Twitter.
2620000	2625000	All of those things are like leaves on a branch as part of a tree.
2625000	2628000	And it all goes back to dopamine being generated in your brain.
2628000	2629000	Yeah, yeah.
2629000	2631000	You're comforting yourself.
2631000	2633000	You go, I want to write...
2633000	2635000	Writing is coming up against my limitations.
2635000	2636000	I don't want to be doing that.
2636000	2637000	What do I want to be doing?
2637000	2639000	I feel like it clears the pipes, though.
2639000	2640000	Because it's like...
2640000	2641000	You've got a lot of blockage.
2641000	2642000	And you're like, fuck.
2642000	2644000	I just want to watch something I'm watching.
2644000	2646000	And, you know, I don't want to think about your movies.
2646000	2647000	All right.
2647000	2650000	Well, Abed, I've tried using your method of clearing the pipes constantly.
2650000	2652000	And I got less writing done than when I stopped drinking off.
2652000	2654000	You mean weed?
2654000	2655000	No. What?
2655000	2656000	Clearing the pipes... Oh, sorry.
2656000	2657000	Sorry.
2657000	2660000	Don't be sorry. Just make sense.
2660000	2661000	No, no.
2661000	2663000	You don't have to apologize.
2663000	2664000	Just communicate.
2664000	2665000	Forget it.
2665000	2668000	My brain did one of those, like, random things.
2668000	2670000	All right. Real Abed.
2670000	2671000	Well, the...
2671000	2672000	What's the paperback?
2672000	2674000	What did you buy at the comic book store?
2674000	2675000	I just like...
2675000	2676000	It's awkward because it's like...
2676000	2677000	Whoa.
2677000	2679000	This isn't even something that I've read or I know about.
2679000	2680000	I just bought...
2680000	2681000	I got, like...
2681000	2685000	It's Fashion Beast by Alan Moore, issues two and three.
2685000	2686000	I don't even know what it's about.
2686000	2687000	Fashion Beast?
2687000	2688000	Yeah, but it's like...
2688000	2692000	I got it because I really like Alan Moore.
2692000	2693000	Alan Moore's an excellent...
2693000	2695000	That sounds appealing to me, possibly.
2695000	2696000	Alan Moore is the...
2696000	2698000	He's like the Dan Harmon of comics.
2699000	2703000	Well, I just saw the first five minutes of a documentary about Alan Moore.
2703000	2704000	I knew nothing about him.
2704000	2706000	Like, you always hear his name.
2706000	2707000	I'm really late to that party.
2707000	2708000	Oh, really?
2708000	2709000	Yeah, yeah.
2709000	2710000	I knew nothing about him.
2710000	2715000	But amazing that he did all this shit that everyone makes movies about all this shit
2715000	2716000	and he hates it.
2716000	2717000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2717000	2720000	And he's like this amazing, like, articulate, like, crazy...
2720000	2721000	He's like you, kind of.
2721000	2724000	But, I mean, he's like quite an crazy individual.
2724000	2725000	Yeah.
2725000	2727000	Yeah, one should be envious of his...
2727000	2730000	Like, he just planted a flag and goes, this is who I am.
2730000	2731000	No, I mean...
2731000	2732000	He's not...
2732000	2733000	He's putting out into the world.
2733000	2734000	I'm at 40.
2734000	2735000	I don't know.
2735000	2736000	Like, I'm still...
2736000	2741000	I'll probably go to my grave in this lifetime still needing things from other people.
2741000	2744000	But it's so refreshing to see somebody that's like...
2744000	2748000	He's just like pushing shit out and going like, this is how I feel.
2748000	2749000	This is how I think.
2749000	2750000	And it's like a main...
2750000	2753000	You can do like go and dip a cup into his river and drink it.
2754000	2755000	He's pretty interesting.
2755000	2757000	This is Malcolm McLaren on that?
2757000	2758000	Like...
2758000	2760000	Malcolm McLaren, like, Sex Pistols?
2760000	2761000	Like...
2761000	2762000	No, I...
2762000	2763000	Lipstick Traces?
2763000	2764000	No, I mean, he's an artist, I guess.
2764000	2765000	I don't know if the Sex Pistols guy...
2765000	2767000	I'm thinking of a different name, probably.
2767000	2768000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2768000	2769000	I don't think it's the same guy.
2769000	2770000	Oh, is that the guy that was like the...
2770000	2771000	It was the asshole that kept...
2771000	2772000	Yeah.
2772000	2773000	That kept it on heroin.
2773000	2774000	Right from the book, right?
2774000	2777000	The Phil from the Fury and Johnny Rotten blames him for killing...
2777000	2779000	For helping, you know, shit over this.
2779000	2781000	I think it's the same name, yeah.
2781000	2782000	Different guy?
2782000	2783000	Same guy.
2783000	2784000	Same guy.
2784000	2785000	He's a cunt.
2785000	2786000	Same guy, though?
2786000	2788000	Malcolm McLaren's a cunt, and I hope he comes on the show.
2788000	2790000	Wait, so the Sex Pistols guy drew this?
2790000	2791000	I don't know.
2791000	2792000	His name is on the thing up there.
2792000	2794000	Well, maybe he co-wrote it.
2794000	2795000	Alright.
2795000	2796000	Bruce Filanche and Malcolm...
2796000	2798000	Jamal Warner, whatever.
2798000	2800000	Malcolm McLaren.
2800000	2801000	He must be Scottish.
2801000	2802000	You know what, though?
2802000	2803000	Alan...
2803000	2805000	Remember that time we saw Watchmen?
2805000	2806000	Yeah.
2806000	2809000	And I felt so bad because I love the comic.
2809000	2810000	I felt bad.
2810000	2811000	You know why I felt bad?
2811000	2812000	I just seen Watchmen.
2812000	2813000	Yeah.
2813000	2814000	That's what was funny about it.
2814000	2817000	It was like, I love at the end of the movie just hearing your...
2817000	2819000	You go over about how bad it was.
2819000	2820000	Because I agreed.
2820000	2821000	It was like, it was so bad.
2821000	2823000	And I wanted to like it so much.
2823000	2824000	Because I love the comic.
2824000	2825000	But it just didn't translate.
2825000	2826000	Yeah.
2826000	2827000	And then you...
2827000	2828000	Yeah, it was just funny.
2828000	2832000	It was a movie that set out to ask and answer the question,
2832000	2834000	Who watches the Watchmen?
2836000	2839000	It's unfair, though, because the comic is like...
2839000	2840000	It's really good.
2840000	2841000	That deserved more.
2841000	2842000	That was good.
2842000	2843000	That was a goodie.
2843000	2844000	That was a goodie.
2844000	2845000	You know, it kind of like...
2845000	2846000	You look disappointed.
2846000	2850000	I'm sure there were a lot of reviews that capitalized on that tee up feeling.
2850000	2852000	Well, some people like it, but I was like you.
2852000	2854000	I was like, I was so fucking bored.
2854000	2855000	I was like, oh, God.
2855000	2856000	I don't think...
2856000	2858000	And I think Alan Moore would probably agree.
2858000	2862000	I don't think when you adapt a comic into the television medium
2862000	2869000	or the cinematic medium, I don't think your job is to take all of the content
2869000	2872000	from the comic book, which is a specific medium,
2872000	2875000	and translate it onto this two-dimensional screen in front of you.
2875000	2876000	What was the 99 Red Balloon's part?
2876000	2877000	That was so confusing.
2877000	2878000	Like, why they played that song.
2878000	2879000	I was confused.
2879000	2880000	I really don't remember.
2880000	2883000	I don't remember that song in the comic, you know.
2883000	2884000	Maybe it was playing.
2884000	2886000	I must have missed something there.
2886000	2889000	That was like that movie just full of moments like that
2889000	2890000	or the guy's ass.
2890000	2893000	I think the biggest problem with cinema today
2893000	2895000	is that writing is increasingly a lost art
2895000	2899000	because it gets easier and easier to...
2899000	2902000	Writing software is now just like anyone, anyone,
2902000	2908000	like a fire hydrant outside is ten fingers away from writing a screenplay.
2908000	2910000	It used to be like, oh, you have to know how to set the margins
2910000	2911000	and also what if you...
2911000	2914000	Oh, there's a typo on one page and you're going to get out whiteout
2914000	2915000	or type the page over again.
2915000	2918000	There used to be a filter there that guaranteed the people
2918000	2921000	who were definitely passionate about getting that job done right
2921000	2922000	were the people that did that stuff.
2922000	2923000	Now, fuck it.
2923000	2924000	Fuck it.
2924000	2926000	It's as easy as tiddly winks.
2926000	2928000	And directing is not the case.
2928000	2930000	So you have these geniuses, these visionaries
2930000	2932000	who are so good at knowing where to put the camera
2932000	2936000	and so passionate about the ways to use all this new technology,
2936000	2939000	the CG of those guys doing amazing things.
2939000	2940000	It's like, oh, this shot.
2940000	2943000	I want to say that Die Hard movie, the Bourne Paternity,
2943000	2946000	you know, where these are jumping out the...
2946000	2947000	Bourne Paternity.
2947000	2949000	It's like the most amazing effects I've seen to date,
2949000	2950000	but it's a shitty Die Hard sequel.
2950000	2952000	It's like it's poorly written.
2952000	2954000	You know, the writing is not...
2954000	2956000	Because we've now regarded writing as like,
2956000	2957000	like, ah, fuck you.
2957000	2958000	Give me the script.
2958000	2959000	Hurry up.
2959000	2960000	Give me the script.
2960000	2961000	Give me the script, fatty.
2961000	2962000	Thank you.
2962000	2963000	Hey, 10 fatties.
2963000	2964000	10 fatties.
2964000	2965000	Got any 10 fatties?
2965000	2966000	Soowee.
2966000	2967000	Rewrite it.
2967000	2968000	Rewrite it.
2968000	2969000	Just keep rewriting it.
2969000	2970000	Keep rewriting it, you fucking fatty.
2970000	2971000	You neckbeards.
2971000	2972000	You fucking...
2972000	2975000	You love Die Hard and it's for a good reason
2975000	2977000	because that was based on a novel.
2977000	2978000	No, no.
2978000	2979000	That's not why.
2979000	2980000	It's because the movie was good.
2980000	2981000	The novel can suck my dick.
2981000	2982000	It is a good movie,
2982000	2984000	but I think because it was based on a novel...
2984000	2985000	Die Hard 2 was based on a novel.
2985000	2986000	Die Hard 3 was probably based on a novel.
2986000	2987000	It doesn't matter.
2987000	2988000	I don't think there's three Die Hard novels.
2988000	2989000	There's gotta be just one.
2989000	2993000	No, Abed, there was no Die Hard novel.
2993000	2994000	There was a Die Hard novel.
2994000	2995000	I've seen the cover.
2995000	2996000	Abed, it wasn't called Die Hard.
2996000	2998000	I know it was called Something the Building Blew Up.
2998000	2999000	Exactly.
2999000	3000000	No, no, something...
3000000	3002000	And then there was another novel
3002000	3004000	called Something the Airport Blew Up.
3004000	3005000	It wasn't related.
3005000	3008000	It wasn't called Nakatomi 2, the airport this time.
3008000	3009000	Oh, I see.
3009000	3010000	It's not...
3010000	3012000	I'm saying for the Die Hard movies,
3012000	3013000	they take novels and they go,
3013000	3014000	oh, put...
3014000	3016000	And then John McClain's in there, too.
3016000	3018000	I've never read any of these books.
3018000	3019000	Do you know Frank Sinatra?
3019000	3020000	Wasn't there some movie?
3020000	3022000	The Die Hard franchise is...
3022000	3023000	Detective.
3023000	3024000	What was that?
3024000	3025000	The Detective.
3025000	3026000	The Detective?
3026000	3027000	Okay.
3027000	3028000	I'm out of my depth here,
3028000	3031000	but there's a novel that Die Hard's based on.
3031000	3032000	They at one time...
3032000	3033000	Did they make it?
3033000	3034000	Did they make the movie?
3034000	3037000	Yeah, it's in the same series of books.
3037000	3039000	But did they make a movie with Sinatra?
3039000	3040000	Yeah.
3040000	3041000	Okay.
3041000	3044000	So there's a Sinatra movie called The Detective
3044000	3047000	in which Sinatra is the John McClain character.
3047000	3048000	I have never seen it.
3048000	3049000	I did not know that.
3049000	3050000	That's crazy.
3050000	3051000	Is it any good?
3051000	3052000	Good old Sinatra.
3052000	3053000	I've never seen it.
3053000	3054000	Oh, wow. That's cool.
3054000	3055000	Yeah.
3055000	3056000	It's kind of interesting.
3056000	3057000	He was a good actor, right?
3057000	3058000	Like Manchurian candidate?
3058000	3059000	Wasn't he good in that?
3059000	3062000	He was good for a guy who sang for a living, for sure.
3062000	3063000	Yeah.
3063000	3064000	Yeah.
3064000	3065000	It's not like that today, right?
3065000	3066000	I don't know.
3066000	3068000	He won the Oscar for From Here to Eternity or something like that?
3068000	3069000	Yeah.
3069000	3070000	I mean, he was sharp.
3070000	3071000	He was a good actor.
3071000	3072000	Yeah.
3072000	3073000	Anyways, it doesn't matter.
3073000	3075000	The director, the writers...
3075000	3077000	Good movies are often a fluke.
3077000	3079000	Die Hard 1 was really good.
3079000	3080000	You can't repeat.
3080000	3081000	Everyone tries to repeat.
3081000	3084000	Let's get John McTernan to direct another thing.
3084000	3086000	It's very, very difficult to...
3086000	3088000	It was like lightning in a bottle.
3088000	3089000	It's just sort of like an accident.
3089000	3090000	You could see from the movie.
3090000	3093000	They weren't trying to make an awesome classic action film.
3093000	3094000	Same with Ghostbuster.
3094000	3095000	That was going to influence everything.
3095000	3096000	Yeah.
3096000	3097000	Same with Ghostbusters.
3097000	3098000	That second one is painful.
3098000	3099000	Yeah.
3099000	3100000	Yeah.
3100000	3101000	It's so painful.
3101000	3102000	We said it here first.
3102000	3104000	Because they're so close, but they're just so off the mark in every scene.
3104000	3105000	Yeah.
3105000	3107000	I hate when they get on the slime and they're fighting.
3107000	3108000	It's ridiculous.
3108000	3111000	And you get the DVDs and you can watch the deleted scenes on the first Ghostbusters movie
3111000	3112000	or Stripes or anything.
3112000	3114000	All these awesome, like Ivan Reitman movies.
3114000	3117000	You get to the deleted scenes and then you go, holy shit.
3117000	3122000	If these eight scenes had been in the movie, this thing would have been a random mishmash.
3122000	3126000	The lesson we should take away from that is a nice humble one.
3126000	3129000	The thing that we're trying to achieve is a spiritual event.
3129000	3130000	Yeah.
3130000	3131000	It's a collaboration.
3131000	3132000	No one's a genius.
3132000	3135000	Like Wieckowski Brothers, you're not a genius.
3135000	3141000	You sat down and you made a movie called The Matrix where you were so joyful.
3141000	3143000	You were like, I hope we make a good movie.
3143000	3144000	I love this movie.
3144000	3145000	I love that movie.
3145000	3146000	I love that movie.
3146000	3148000	You make The Matrix kind of an accident.
3148000	3149000	You make Jaws an accident.
3149000	3151000	You make Die Hard an accident.
3151000	3152000	Yeah.
3152000	3153000	There's smart people.
3153000	3154000	There's dumb people.
3154000	3155000	There's talented people.
3155000	3156000	There's passionate people.
3156000	3157000	But when you make a good movie, you're fucking lucky.
3157000	3158000	You're lucky.
3158000	3159000	No.
3159000	3161400	And Back to the Future because it's like that movie's so perfect and then I watched them
3161400	3164000	again recently and the second one is just off.
3164000	3167160	It's like, ah, there's just like all these levels to it that aren't working.
3167160	3168160	Yeah.
3168160	3169160	There's no way.
3169160	3170640	Even the almighty empire strikes back.
3170640	3171640	Everyone goes, oh, I love it.
3171640	3172640	No.
3172640	3176240	You remember being 11 and like it gave you so much.
3176240	3178560	It gave you so much more action figure wise.
3178560	3179560	But that's...
3180120	3182120	Wait, are you saying that you don't like empire?
3182120	3188560	I'm just saying it's I'm saying that unlike I'm 40 years old, I'm entitled to my opinion.
3188560	3189560	You look bored.
3189560	3193040	I don't think it's the best movie of the Star Wars trilogy.
3193040	3201120	I think that Star Wars is so good that Empire Strikes Back can sit on it as a patio and
3201120	3202120	not break.
3202120	3205160	But see, you're looking at it as like the foundation is what makes the second one important,
3205160	3206160	right?
3206160	3207160	That's where your angle is.
3207160	3211400	It's timelessness and storytelling and clear, simple things like Star Wars.
3211400	3212400	Joseph Campbell.
3212400	3213400	Star Wars could be a cowboy movie.
3213400	3216520	You could tell the same story as a little farm boy from a small farm town.
3216520	3219480	He goes and becomes a bigger part of a bigger world, blah, blah, blah.
3219480	3221760	Empire Strikes Back is driven by sci-fi concepts.
3221760	3225920	If there's no big penis monster trying to swallow your spaceship, there's no movie.
3225920	3226920	It doesn't make sense.
3226920	3231080	A plot point is we're inside a squishy thing and it's like there's a million plot points
3231080	3233960	in Empire Strikes Back that are like it has to be a sci-fi movie.
3233960	3236160	So it's just at the end of the day, a good sci-fi movie.
3236160	3237760	Empire was as a timeless masterpiece.
3237760	3238760	Let's move on.
3238760	3240080	Okay, well, all right, all right.
3240080	3241080	Yeah.
3241080	3245240	I mean, after dinner, I want to say, I mean, after the show, I want to tell you why I think
3245240	3246240	Empire is better.
3246240	3247240	After dinner?
3247240	3252400	Did you just ask Dan out on a date?
3252400	3253400	You caught me.
3253400	3254840	Next week, we're going to hear about that date.
3254840	3255840	Slick way.
3255840	3261440	And then we're going to find out that he left like a sock at your place.
3261440	3266120	Is it possible to have Abed play Krista Berg in, I'm assuming, Kumail's now?
3267080	3268480	Yeah, Kumail and Johnny cannot make it tonight.
3268480	3271880	Can we get another mic for Aaron and bring, let's get Spencer up here and...
3271880	3275080	Well, yeah, I'm kind of a D&D virgin.
3275080	3276080	You know what I mean?
3276080	3277080	What's that?
3277080	3278080	I'm a D&D virgin.
3278080	3279080	I've never played before.
3279080	3280080	That's all right.
3280080	3281080	It's fine.
3281080	3282080	I know, but don't I have to know stuff?
3282080	3283080	No.
3283080	3287080	Spencer, everyone.
3287080	3288080	And Aaron McGathey.
3288080	3289080	Put them off to the side, kind of.
3289080	3290080	They're in the way.
3290080	3291080	Just put them there.
3291080	3292080	Thank you.
3292080	3293080	Hello, Spencer.
3293080	3294080	How are you doing today, man?
3294080	3295080	I'm doing good.
3295080	3296080	I just dropped the dice.
3296080	3297080	I'm doing good.
3297080	3298080	You can sit down.
3298080	3299080	I'll stand.
3299080	3300080	You dropped the dice?
3300080	3301080	Yeah, that's fine.
3301080	3302080	What did you roll?
3302080	3303080	I can't see it.
3303080	3304080	That's a good sign, though.
3304080	3315840	Dice on the floor, Adventures Galore.
3315840	3318840	Dice on the table, Evil is ...
3318840	3319840	Able.
3319840	3320840	To happen.
3320840	3321840	To happen.
3321840	3325840	Are you awkward that I stand, or, you know, that I sit down?
3325840	3326840	I am awkward that I stand, yeah.
3326840	3330280	But I'll be so far down, it'll be, like, weird.
3330280	3331280	No, you can stand.
3331280	3332280	Actually, you sit.
3332280	3333280	I don't want to be a rude host.
3333280	3334280	Are you sure?
3334280	3335280	Yeah, yeah, you sit there.
3335280	3336280	Well, now I feel bad, because ...
3336280	3337280	You should.
3337280	3338280	That's good.
3338280	3339280	You're a Dr. Host.
3339280	3342440	We're most comfortable when you feel bad.
3342440	3343440	That's true.
3343440	3344440	That's true.
3344440	3345440	You're like Superman in the train tracks.
3345440	3350720	You'll be filling in for Camille's character, Chris de Bourgh, who is a thief, I'm not mistaken,
3350720	3351720	right, Spencer?
3351720	3352720	That's correct.
3352720	3353720	Chris de Bourgh?
3353720	3354720	Like, Christberg?
3354720	3355720	Yes.
3355720	3356720	Yes.
3356720	3357720	No, he's a Jewish messiah.
3357720	3358720	He wrote Lady in Red.
3358720	3359720	Chris de Bourgh.
3359720	3365960	Yeah, he wrote the song, The Lady in Red, from the 80s, and he's been on hard times,
3365960	3370240	but now he's taken part in our adventure with us in our quest towards wherever the hell
3370240	3371240	we're going.
3371240	3372240	Who knows it?
3372240	3373320	We got through all of my items.
3373320	3376840	Is he like a new member of the correct quest, like he just joined?
3376840	3377840	Yeah.
3377840	3378840	Okay.
3378840	3379840	Yeah.
3379840	3380840	Sorry, I'm just trying.
3380840	3384280	Spencer, are you ready to get us up to date?
3384280	3385280	Not quite.
3385280	3386280	I mean, what's up, you guys?
3386280	3387280	No, let's kill some time.
3387280	3388280	Okay, go ahead.
3388280	3391600	Dan, I got to say great analogies tonight.
3391600	3392600	Thank you.
3392600	3400560	It always sounds sarcastic when I'm complimenting you, but really good, the omelet line and
3400560	3401560	the ...
3402560	3405080	Yeah, but even your omelet needs something.
3405080	3406080	Thanks, baby.
3406080	3407080	Right, guys?
3407080	3408080	Great analogies.
3408080	3409080	We're really good.
3409080	3411080	How are you enjoying living with me?
3411080	3412080	I'm loving it.
3412080	3415680	Yeah, we're making the space I had planned to turn into a giant master bathroom into
3415680	3417200	your little art studio.
3417200	3419280	Yeah, I like that.
3419280	3421960	It's a nice testament to ... It's like, you know what?
3421960	3424880	I'll keep using a slightly smaller bathroom.
3424880	3427880	That's what relationships are.
3427880	3433040	Every time I walk in that room, I really feel your love.
3433040	3443080	You feel the ghost of my dreams of having this Roman bath, this calligulant ... I was
3443080	3447640	going to have people pour pictures of hot water over me, but now it's where you make
3447640	3448640	calendars.
3448640	3449640	That would be awesome.
3449640	3452680	To have a room in your house that's actually a big bath, but there's always a bunch of
3452680	3454280	old Roman senators in there.
3454280	3456880	They're always plotting against me.
3456880	3463760	No matter where I'm at ... Dan, sorry, we didn't know you were here.
3463760	3467040	No matter where I'm at in my life, they're always plotting against me, that just makes
3467040	3468040	me feel more important.
3468040	3470480	I think I would like an egg salad sandwich.
3470480	3471480	Oh, of course, sir.
3471480	3472480	Of course you would.
3472480	3473480	What are you whispering about?
3473480	3474480	Nothing, sir.
3474480	3475480	Nothing.
3475480	3477480	Egg salad, the perfect choice.
3477480	3481880	Just to come home from work and go into the ... Yeah, Aaron, I'm going to go and take
3481880	3484880	a steam, and you're going to ... Hello, Gracchus, hello, Thrasius.
3485880	3492200	You go to the drawing room, and I go like, I think Gracchus and Fraxia are ... I don't
3492200	3495200	think they wanted me to have an egg salad sandwich.
3495200	3496800	I fear the game is afoot.
3496800	3501680	Also, I've never seen them outside of the steam room.
3501680	3504320	I think I'm safe in that regard, because they're pretty unmotivated.
3504320	3509120	Yeah, because I don't bathe often, so it's a den of thieves in there.
3509120	3510120	It's a sewing circle.
3510120	3511120	That's the best.
3512120	3515120	One of them is always Malcolm McDowell.
3515120	3517120	Sure, sure.
3517120	3520120	I love it.
3520120	3523120	I think I have this sweater, but mine's blue.
3523120	3526120	Did you get that at ... Fashion Beast.
3526120	3528120	Yeah, I'm the Fashion Beast.
3528120	3530120	Did you get that at ... I have that sweater.
3530120	3531120	Where did you get that?
3531120	3533120	I wonder if we shop at the same store.
3533120	3535120	I don't know.
3535120	3537120	21 Forever?
3537120	3538120	Target.
3538120	3539120	Yeah, that's where I got mine.
3539120	3540120	Oh, my God.
3540120	3543120	See, I knew I was like just ... People are going on Target.
3543120	3545120	You know this sweater from Target?
3545120	3549120	So you have ... Lady, take it easy.
3549120	3550120	No, I'm kidding.
3550120	3551120	Jeremy, did you cut out the sleeves?
3551120	3552120	What's your name back there?
3552120	3553120	I'm Paula from Scotland.
3553120	3554120	Paula from Scotland?
3554120	3555120	Hello, Paula.
3555120	3556120	How are you?
3556120	3557120	I'm a big Teenage Fan Club fan.
3557120	3558120	Yeah.
3558120	3559120	They're amazing.
3559120	3560120	Great.
3560120	3562120	Way to connect those dots, man.
3562120	3566120	Great job on Teenage Fan Club, by the way, and Arab Strap.
3566120	3567120	They're great.
3567120	3569120	She's so in love with you, Jeff.
3569120	3570120	You have no idea.
3570120	3573120	Where are you from?
3573120	3574120	What?
3574120	3575120	London.
3575120	3576120	Wow.
3576120	3578120	She just said, she's so in love with you, Jeff.
3578120	3579120	You have no idea.
3579120	3580120	Podcast listeners.
3580120	3581120	I like you as a friend.
3581120	3582120	It's a lot happening.
3586120	3587120	Thank you, Paula.
3587120	3589120	But you have to hear the accents, really.
3589120	3590120	I hope the mic's picked up.
3590120	3593120	It's like a terrible sequel to the train spotting or something.
3593120	3594120	They have a cool accent.
3594120	3597120	It works against them, because I'm sure they're already drunk,
3597120	3599120	but the Scottish accent, yeah.
3599120	3601120	What?
3601120	3605120	The Scottish accent makes you sound twice as drunk.
3605120	3606120	It's amazing.
3606120	3610120	It's a great, great day for muta-car racing.
3615120	3617120	Offensive and an old reference.
3617120	3621120	I check a comedy sports accent workshop.
3621120	3622120	Yeah.
3622120	3623120	Give me an accent.
3623120	3624120	Irish.
3624120	3627120	You think you love me, but you don't.
3627120	3628120	All right.
3628120	3629120	Boston.
3629120	3630120	Boston.
3630120	3631120	Boston.
3631120	3632120	I'm wicked retarded.
3634120	3635120	Madagascar.
3640120	3641120	He's eating a lot of grapes.
3641120	3642120	He's eating a lot of grapes.
3642120	3643120	It's not bad.
3643120	3644120	That was more Mozambique.
3647120	3649120	Can you do Australian?
3650120	3651120	I...
3653120	3654120	Boomerang.
3655120	3656120	Forget it.
3656120	3658120	I only knew the Irish and Scottish ones.
3658120	3659120	Thanks for hitting those first.
3659120	3660120	We should have stopped there.
3660120	3661120	All right.
3661120	3662120	How about Russian?
3662120	3663120	You got to have a motion squirrel.
3663120	3666120	You are giving me micro fish.
3667120	3668120	French.
3671120	3672120	German.
3672120	3675120	We must get the cereal.
3677120	3678120	What?
3678120	3680120	We must get the cereal.
3682120	3683120	Go on.
3683120	3684120	Cereal nuts.
3684120	3689120	For cereal is important for muta-car racing.
3689120	3690120	Scottish.
3690120	3693120	Must annex muta-car track.
3693120	3694120	Let me see your papers.
3694120	3695120	For the viewer.
3695120	3696120	Your papers, sir.
3696120	3697120	Your papers.
3697120	3699120	My papers are right here.
3699120	3700120	Headbutt.
3700120	3701120	Running.
3701120	3702120	Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.
3702120	3703120	Opening smart car.
3703120	3705120	Muta-car racing.
3705120	3708120	Must ignore muta-car siren.
3708120	3710120	Racing out of Berlin.
3710120	3712120	I'm double agent.
3712120	3713120	All points bolted.
3713120	3716120	A man pretending to be Scottish is driving towards the German border.
3718120	3720120	Meanwhile, at the Reichstag...
3721120	3724120	Signing these Hitler papers is so boring.
3724120	3725120	Where's my cereal?
3726120	3727120	Father.
3730120	3731120	Why can't I run Germany?
3731120	3734120	Are they going to find more cereal in my cupboard?
3734120	3735120	Oh, Father.
3736120	3737120	I'm Hitler.
3737120	3738120	Right.
3738120	3739120	You're...
3739120	3740120	I'm Hitler.
3740120	3741120	I'm your father.
3741120	3742120	Yeah.
3742120	3743120	Yes.
3743120	3744120	You loved cereal.
3744120	3745120	Just be careful, my son.
3745120	3748120	When you die, millions of people will shit in your pants.
3751120	3753120	Hear me now and believe me later.
3754120	3755120	Oh!
3755120	3756120	Hands up!
3757120	3758120	Almost got being shot.
3758120	3759120	I'm Hitler.
3759120	3760120	Oh, look.
3762120	3763120	Wait.
3764120	3768120	Hitler only got away with what he did because the cops couldn't find him.
3768120	3770120	The whole time, the German police were like,
3770120	3771120	that's not right.
3771120	3773120	You're under arrest and we can't find...
3774120	3776120	It's just like spoken weed at your house.
3776120	3779120	You're just killing six million people and it's like looking for them.
3779120	3780120	All right, all right.
3780120	3781120	That's enough.
3781120	3783120	You're coming downtown, Hitler.
3784120	3786120	Even the German police are Irish.
3786120	3788120	Oh, what do we got here?
3788120	3789120	Oh, I don't know, Clancy.
3789120	3790120	We're shutting you down.
3790120	3793120	Looks like someone's committing a weep at the genocide.
3795120	3797120	Oh, tell it to the judge.
3798120	3799120	Oh, no.
3799120	3802120	I ain't got Hitler home for the guy I was doing.
3802120	3803120	Oh, yeah.
3803120	3804120	I'll keep talking, sir.
3804120	3806120	You're coming downtown.
3806120	3808120	I'm from the Gestapo.
3809120	3810120	No, they're not.
3810120	3811120	The Gestapo's his.
3811120	3812120	They're good old fashioned police.
3812120	3813120	They got billy clubs.
3813120	3814120	I think...
3815120	3816120	All right.
3816120	3817120	For Jesus.
3817120	3818120	Let's play some.
3818120	3819120	Let's do it.
3819120	3820120	Let's bring this thing on that.
3820120	3821120	Get us up to date, would you?
3821120	3822120	All right.
3823120	3825120	Last time on Harmontown, our heroes.
3826120	3827120	What?
3827120	3828120	Nothing.
3828120	3829120	This is good.
3829120	3830120	They would have heard it on Harmontown.
3830120	3831120	Yeah.
3831120	3832120	Yeah.
3832120	3836120	With the help of Christa Berg, traverse the dark forests of Twyla.
3836120	3841120	The troop defeated a small horde of zombies before coming upon the ruins of Mershul.
3841120	3849120	Passing strange statues, they made their way to a mysterious stat of trees, entwined and entangled into a massive clump of trunks and brambles.
3849120	3855120	Throwing caution to the wind, Quark jumped through a narrow crack in the trees, falling into a muddy hole below.
3855120	3860120	Soon after, the rest of the party followed, and together they found themselves stuck in the muck.
3860120	3866120	After searching around in the darkness, they found an odd tile, discovering it to be made of thin wood and kicked it to kindling.
3866120	3873120	Sharpie cast light on an arrow, which Christa Berg handily shot through the open, and he crawled through into the narrow tunnel.
3873120	3884120	Examining a large mosaic depicting a green dragon on the floor, he attempted to remove what appeared to be a massive treasure before he realized he had sprung a trap.
3884120	3885120	I'm so serious.
3885120	3886120	This is awful.
3886120	3887120	Fuck everything.
3887120	3888120	No, it's great.
3888120	3889120	I'm just going to leave right now.
3889120	3890120	What's going on?
3890120	3891120	What do you mean?
3891120	3892120	I'm not reading off of this.
3892120	3895120	You're not living up to the harmontown mark of quality?
3895120	3898120	You set such a big standard.
3898120	3900120	Yeah, it's been a tight show.
3900120	3902120	It's a hard act to follow.
3902120	3908120	A solid wall of thick stone thudded into the ground, blocking the exit, began rumbling toward the songmaster.
3908120	3910120	What would he do?
3910120	3911120	What would he do?
3911120	3913120	Still, he gets the music just right.
3913120	3918120	Spencer, I'm going to call bullshit on that one.
3918120	3920120	I think he fabricated it.
3920120	3933120	I think you knew the music was longer than you needed, and you faked a moment of insecurity just so you could come back and just come right down on the end of the music.
3933120	3939120	It came from a real moment of insecurity, but I realized I could twist it to my advantage.
3939120	3940120	All right.
3940120	3943120	All right, I examine our immediate surroundings, Spencer.
3943120	3946120	Okay, so you guys were in this dark pit.
3946120	3947120	There was this hole.
3947120	3958120	Christopher crawled through it, and he was looking at the floor, and then he was trying to extricate a large ruby, and that caused a trap to go off, causing a wall to separate the two of you.
3958120	3962120	The wall started approaching, threatening to crush him against the wall.
3962120	3965120	Evasion is a special ability.
3965120	3967120	Can I evade?
3967120	3971120	You cannot evade getting crushed to death between two walls.
3971120	3972120	Oh, no.
3973120	3984120	So when you were playing as Kumail, or when Kumail was playing as your character, who you're playing as, whatever, he was pulling the ruby out of the ground, and it was big.
3984120	3988120	It was this big thing, and he was starting to get it, and it was starting to come out of the ground.
3988120	3992120	But he's trapped because you don't know if you want to pull it out of the ground.
3992120	3994120	Can you put the ruby back in and stop the wall from dropping?
3994120	3997120	Yeah, I'm going to put the ruby back, because that seems like a no-no.
3997120	3998120	Dropping the ruby.
3998120	4000120	It falls into its place.
4000120	4001120	The wall continues to advance.
4001120	4002120	Shit.
4002120	4003120	Oh, no.
4003120	4006120	So from our perspective, we see a wall moving forward.
4006120	4007120	Yeah, okay.
4007120	4009120	So like I said, there's this hole.
4009120	4012120	So at this point, you're probably peering through because you're like, what the fuck, right?
4012120	4021120	So Quark, he tried to jump through and save him, if I recall correctly, but the wall thudded down before that.
4021120	4024120	So he's probably in the best position to see what's going on.
4024120	4028120	But yeah, basically, you saw the wall come down, and it's going towards...
4028120	4031120	So the wall's in between me and Christa Berg right now?
4031120	4035120	Yeah, and you can tell from what you've seen that it's probably going to crush him.
4035120	4037120	And the wall's moving away from Jeff.
4037120	4038120	Away from you.
4038120	4041120	Is there a way to get over the wall, or does it go straight into the ceiling?
4041120	4043120	It goes from the ceiling all the way down.
4043120	4046120	So there's no way to get around it or over or under it?
4046120	4048120	Not as far as you can tell.
4048120	4049120	Damn it.
4049120	4055120	I look around on the floor for any kind of triggers or traps just to sense some way to stop this.
4055120	4057120	All right.
4058120	4059120	Nope.
4059120	4060120	Oops.
4060120	4061120	All right.
4061120	4063120	Let me ask you a question, sidebar.
4063120	4064120	Okay.
4064120	4065120	This takes no time.
4065120	4066120	Quit.
4066120	4068120	Anyway, even though it takes no time.
4068120	4069120	Tensor's floating disk.
4069120	4070120	Yeah.
4070120	4071120	Okay.
4071120	4072120	It takes up space, right?
4072120	4073120	We've written upon it.
4073120	4077120	So it's a thing that physically occupies space?
4077120	4078120	Yeah.
4078120	4082120	Can I cast it through a wall?
4082120	4085120	My objective would be to cast Tensor's floating disk as a wedge.
4085120	4091120	Indiana Jones style, like wedge the, like create a space that couldn't, you know, to hold it.
4091120	4092120	Okay.
4092120	4096120	So if this was like a weak force that wouldn't be capable of crushing a human to death, like
4096120	4097120	that might function.
4097120	4098120	All right.
4098120	4100120	And also you don't have line of effect to the target.
4100120	4101120	Okay.
4101120	4102120	To my understanding.
4102120	4103120	All right.
4103120	4104120	All right.
4104120	4105120	Fine.
4105120	4106120	Anybody out in the audience have any ideas for this?
4106120	4107120	Magic hands.
4107120	4108120	Magic hands, says Jeremy.
4108120	4109120	A hole.
4109120	4110120	A hole.
4110120	4111120	Or the portable hole?
4112120	4113120	Is there a hole?
4113120	4115120	Like you're by, you don't have the portable hole.
4115120	4117120	No, you got, I don't have the port.
4117120	4118120	I don't know.
4118120	4119120	I have a, what is this a portable wire?
4119120	4120120	So no, that's not a hole.
4120120	4121120	Nope.
4121120	4125120	I, I, I have mage hand, but I already asked about that last week.
4125120	4127120	Can only, uh, inflict very light forces.
4127120	4128120	Yeah.
4128120	4129120	It says five pounds.
4129120	4130120	Yeah.
4130120	4131120	It's pretty weak.
4131120	4132120	Why did you ask her how big is the Ruby?
4132120	4133120	How big is the Ruby?
4133120	4137120	I'd say it's about, does the Ruby have girth?
4137120	4138120	Somebody asks.
4138120	4140120	I think I know the answer.
4140120	4141120	Wait.
4141120	4142120	What were you going to say, sir?
4142120	4144120	Is it, is it larger than the width of a human body?
4144120	4145120	I'd say yeah.
4145120	4148120	It's, it's, it's roughly the size of a manhole cover.
4148120	4149120	Okay.
4149120	4152120	Can he line up the Ruby and then wedge himself?
4152120	4155120	Like if he left it out, perhaps.
4155120	4158120	I think I'm going to lift that Ruby out.
4158120	4159120	All right.
4159120	4160120	Sounds like a good plan.
4160120	4161120	What's the hole like?
4161120	4163120	Is a hole big enough for him to get inside or not?
4163120	4166120	Well, there's not a hole so much as a socket in which a Ruby is sitting.
4166120	4167120	Right.
4167120	4168120	Okay.
4168120	4169120	Anyway, you tug at the Ruby.
4169120	4170120	You tug at the Ruby with all your might.
4170120	4172120	It begins to budge.
4172120	4173120	You think you're making good progress.
4173120	4176120	It's going to take a couple more tugs or so.
4176120	4178120	The wall continues its approach.
4178120	4179120	Tug, Chris.
4179120	4180120	Tug.
4180120	4181120	I'm tugging.
4181120	4182120	I'm tugging.
4182120	4183120	Continuing to tug.
4183120	4184120	I'm continuing to tug.
4184120	4187120	You increase your tugging speed and intensity.
4187120	4188120	I'm going faster.
4188120	4190120	Are you, are you masturbating in there?
4190120	4191120	What's going on?
4191120	4192120	That's what I just realized.
4192120	4194120	No, I'm tugging at a Ruby, man.
4194120	4195120	All right.
4195120	4196120	Okay.
4197120	4198120	Gross.
4198120	4201120	This lodged from its socket and you can see below a deep dark hole.
4201120	4202120	Whoa.
4202120	4203120	Whoa.
4203120	4204120	Okay, wait.
4204120	4205120	Oh, I didn't, that wasn't, I didn't mean to make fun of you.
4205120	4206120	Sorry.
4206120	4207120	No, no, no.
4207120	4208120	That's my natural reaction.
4208120	4209120	That was my, yeah.
4209120	4211120	That was my natural reaction to your natural reaction.
4211120	4212120	Well, there you go.
4212120	4213120	I'm enjoying myself.
4213120	4217120	Can you get, Chris, can you get inside the hole of the Ruby occupied?
4217120	4218120	Is it big enough for you?
4218120	4219120	Definitely.
4219120	4225120	Well, I will, I think I'm going to throw that 150 foot rope down the hole and we can
4225120	4226120	all climb.
4226120	4227120	Well, you can climb.
4227120	4229120	It's just you in that little section right now.
4229120	4230120	Oh, well I'll climb.
4230120	4231120	Yeah.
4231120	4232120	All right.
4232120	4233120	I'm going to climb down this hole.
4233120	4235420	Quickly throwing the rope down to the hatch.
4235420	4237120	You notice that it's not tied to anything.
4237120	4239120	It falls down the hole.
4239120	4241120	Don't throw the rope down before you tie it.
4241120	4242120	There's nothing, Chris.
4242120	4245320	I can't cast reduced person through the, through the thing.
4245320	4246320	I need a line of sight.
4246320	4247320	Yeah.
4247320	4248320	Yeah.
4248320	4249320	Maybe you can save that rope.
4249320	4250320	It's okay.
4250320	4251320	He doesn't know what's happening.
4251320	4252320	Did he just throw the rope down a hole?
4252320	4253320	Yeah.
4253320	4254320	Just like throwing it like a piece of garbage.
4255320	4256320	Jesus.
4256320	4258320	Can you shimmy down or climb down?
4258320	4260320	The wall continues its approach.
4260320	4261320	Uh, fuck dude.
4261320	4265320	Well, I guess I'm going to jump down this hole.
4265320	4266320	I mean, here we go.
4266320	4269320	Try, try going down slowly, like with your hands out, like, like, like.
4269320	4270320	Can I do that?
4270320	4271320	Am I that cool?
4271320	4272320	I mean, yeah.
4272320	4273320	Yeah.
4273320	4274320	Oh no.
4274320	4275320	You know what?
4275320	4276320	I have this crazy skill that I saw earlier.
4276320	4277320	It's called master climbing kit.
4277320	4278320	I'm going to use that.
4278320	4279320	Okay.
4279320	4280320	Well, that would work if you had a rope.
4281320	4282320	Fuck.
4282320	4284320	This fucking rope is going to be the death of me.
4284320	4285320	Wait.
4285320	4288320	Can I, can I use my, the lack of rope is going to be the death of you.
4288320	4289320	Slow down the wall.
4289320	4291320	Can I use my anchor to your anchor?
4291320	4295320	Um, that it would you, if you could dock it to something on the wall.
4295320	4296320	Okay.
4296320	4297320	You look at the wall.
4297320	4300320	It doesn't have any dockable search surfaces for an anchor to attach you.
4300320	4301320	Otherwise.
4301320	4302320	Yeah.
4302320	4303320	She's talking about quals.
4303320	4304320	Feather token.
4304320	4305320	It creates a magical anchor.
4305320	4306320	Okay.
4306320	4307320	I feed Coco a carrot.
4307320	4308320	Coco's out of the dungeon.
4308320	4309320	Sorry.
4309320	4310320	I'm going to jump down the hole.
4310320	4311320	I mean, what's happening?
4311320	4315320	You lowered yourself down the hole, but you, uh, you fail and you fall.
4315320	4319320	Oh, you fall into the dark abyss.
4319320	4320320	You got something.
4320320	4321320	I found it all room.
4321320	4322320	It's Goonies.
4324320	4326320	I thought you're doing a really bad Camille impression.
4328320	4329320	Am I dying?
4329320	4330320	Is that what's happening?
4330320	4333320	Maybe you tumble through darkness until you land in a pile.
4333320	4335320	What happens when you die?
4335320	4338320	Until you land in a pile of something squishy, dry and dusty.
4338320	4342320	When you land to feel, you feel a great cloud of dust releasing into the air,
4342320	4344320	invading your lungs, burning and itching.
4344320	4348320	You cough incessantly for a bit and feel sickened almost immediately.
4351320	4352320	To no effect though.
4352320	4354320	You managed to shake it off.
4354320	4356320	Not bad.
4356320	4357320	All right.
4357320	4360320	Now has the wall gone all the way across the room?
4360320	4362320	You see the wall for a bit.
4362320	4365320	It strains as if it's trying to smash something.
4365320	4367320	And then you hear a crumpling.
4367320	4369320	The wall strikes the far wall.
4369320	4372320	Before you, you can see a giant green mosaic of a dragon.
4372320	4375320	But in place of its mouth, you only see a dark hole.
4375320	4378320	So that's the hole that Christoperberg just fell through.
4378320	4379320	I don't know.
4379320	4380320	Like you don't know.
4380320	4381320	Oh.
4381320	4384320	I yelled down the hole, Chris, are you okay?
4384320	4385320	Yeah, I'm all right.
4385320	4386320	Oh, shit.
4386320	4390320	I wanted to do the thing in the movies where we reveal how we felt about the character
4390320	4392320	because we think he's dead.
4392320	4395320	But I guess he has to come up behind us at the end of that.
4395320	4396320	Never mind.
4396320	4397320	Never mind.
4397320	4398320	Never mind.
4398320	4399320	Stupid.
4399320	4400320	We'll do it another time.
4400320	4401320	So you're in pitch darkness right now.
4401320	4402320	You can't see a thing.
4402320	4403320	Oh, but I can hear, like, my buddy up there.
4403320	4404320	Definitely.
4404320	4405320	Definitely.
4405320	4406320	Hey, Christoperberg.
4406320	4407320	Hello there.
4407320	4408320	I'm fine.
4408320	4410320	But I can't see anything, though.
4410320	4413320	I need those cool glasses that you have.
4413320	4414320	Actually, does he have?
4414320	4415320	Maybe.
4415320	4419320	I light a torch and toss it down into him so he can see his way down there.
4419320	4424320	You light a torch and toss it down to him so he can see his way down there.
4425320	4426320	It looks like I can see now.
4426320	4428320	You just barely managed to catch it.
4428320	4430320	Oh, there I got it.
4430320	4434320	Okay, so walking through this crazy dark tunnel.
4434320	4435320	Oh, I should stop you.
4435320	4439320	You're sitting on what appears to be a giant mushroom.
4439320	4442320	It's what released this great cloud of dust in the air.
4442320	4444320	That doesn't sound good.
4444320	4450320	Glancing around quickly, you can see the wall is covered in large, fist-sized holes.
4450320	4454320	You can also see a large metal door with a huge, elaborate locking mechanism.
4454320	4457320	A lot of people get frustrated when they land in a mushroom.
4457320	4458320	That's why they're fist-sized holes.
4458320	4460320	You hear hissing.
4460320	4462320	The sounds of hissing.
4462320	4463320	Uh-oh.
4463320	4466320	That means snake.
4466320	4467320	Well...
4467320	4469320	Or a tire leak.
4469320	4471320	Yeah, well, I don't think there's any tires around here.
4471320	4472320	Hey, Christoperberg.
4472320	4475320	Yeah, I think there's a snake down here.
4475320	4477320	If you guys could come down, that'd be great.
4477320	4478320	Just help me out.
4478320	4479320	Can you use that?
4479320	4480320	So throw us the rope.
4480320	4481320	Oh, right, right.
4481320	4482320	I have a rope.
4482320	4483320	I have that staff.
4483320	4484320	I can throw the rope up.
4484320	4486320	Oh, we can climb down the button staff.
4486320	4488320	I use the button staff.
4488320	4490320	Using the button staff.
4490320	4491320	You erect a rope.
4491320	4492320	I mean, not a rope.
4492320	4493320	That's stupid.
4493320	4494320	You erect a staff.
4494320	4496320	It reaches all the way down below.
4496320	4497320	Nice.
4497320	4500320	I'm going to grab this staff and ride my way up.
4500320	4502320	I have a witch.
4502320	4507320	I slide down it behind Sharpie, and we both do like Batman and Robin quips.
4508320	4514320	Holy mushroom powder, Sharpie.
4514320	4517320	But at some point we hit Christoperberg who's coming up, right?
4517320	4518320	Well, yeah.
4518320	4523320	Did you plant the rod so that it was in the mushroom or not on the mushroom?
4523320	4524320	The floor next to the mushroom.
4524320	4525320	Okay.
4525320	4527320	Then you don't hit him.
4527320	4529320	Wait, he said he was climbing up the pole.
4529320	4530320	Oh, well, then you do hit him.
4530320	4531320	Yeah.
4532320	4533320	Ouch.
4533320	4534320	You're at an impasse.
4534320	4536320	Well, we're coming down.
4536320	4537320	Well, I'm coming up.
4537320	4540320	I don't know if you want to come down because I heard some hissing.
4540320	4541320	It could be a snake.
4541320	4543320	You're coming up?
4543320	4544320	I guess so.
4544320	4545320	Is that cool?
4545320	4546320	I guess we better get this party started.
4546320	4547320	All right.
4550320	4551320	Fuck you.
4551320	4554320	It was delicious, low-hanging fruit.
4557320	4560320	Well, maybe I'll stay put because...
4560320	4563320	Yeah, listen, I understand your impulse to come back up because you were
4563320	4566320	previously in a situation where you weren't able to come back up,
4566320	4568320	so now your first instinct is to come up.
4568320	4572320	But speaking on behalf of the people that were up and couldn't come down,
4572320	4574320	I'm saying the grass is always greener on the other side,
4574320	4575320	vertically or horizontally.
4575320	4576320	Like, we're coming down.
4576320	4577320	I suggest you stay down.
4577320	4578320	I don't think there's grass here, though.
4578320	4579320	Just get down.
4579320	4580320	Oh.
4580320	4581320	I also go down.
4581320	4583320	It's like it's dark.
4583320	4587320	The combined weight of everyone going down at once overcomes.
4589320	4590320	Guys, guys.
4590320	4592320	We got to start fucking cooperating a little bit.
4593320	4594320	Especially on ladders.
4594320	4595320	That shit's dangerous.
4595320	4598320	Well, Spencer, I thought they were already down.
4598320	4602320	I think that the way it's painted in my head, there's a rod.
4602320	4603320	Right.
4603320	4604320	It is standing next to a mushroom.
4604320	4605320	Yeah.
4605320	4606320	He's climbing up.
4606320	4607320	Yep.
4607320	4610320	His face is basically in your under rows.
4610320	4611320	Yep.
4611320	4612320	And now you two have come atop.
4612320	4613320	Yeah.
4613320	4617320	And that's causing the whole assembly to slide down slowly to the floor.
4617320	4618320	Yeah.
4618320	4621320	Can I use my long, beautiful hair as wings and float down?
4621320	4622320	Yeah.
4622320	4624320	It's like a parachute lifted you slowly to the ground.
4624320	4625320	Thank you.
4625320	4627320	Whoa, guys.
4627320	4629320	I cast feather fall and get off the pole, too.
4629320	4634320	If Christopher wants to go up and, you know, co-starred his music career, you can.
4634320	4635320	All right.
4635320	4637320	So are we all down by the mushroom profession?
4637320	4638320	That's true.
4638320	4639320	Okay.
4639320	4640320	So I look around.
4640320	4641320	What's going on down there?
4641320	4642320	You see a wall.
4642320	4643320	You see it's a rounded chamber.
4643320	4646320	Some might say ove-loid.
4646320	4648320	Some might say what?
4648320	4651320	There's definitely fist-sized holes dotting the walls.
4651320	4654320	You can hear the hissing that he was talking about earlier.
4654320	4655320	It's in fact growing stronger.
4655320	4658320	You know, that hissing is coming from behind the wall.
4658320	4660320	There's also a large metal door.
4660320	4662320	It's embedded in the wall.
4662320	4664320	It's the only door you can see.
4664320	4667320	It has a large elaborate locking mechanism and a large keyhole in it.
4667320	4669320	I got a feeling you hit that lock wrong.
4669320	4670320	Snakes through those holes.
4670320	4671320	Am I right?
4671320	4672320	I don't know, man.
4672320	4674320	Good theory, man.
4674320	4677320	Well, isn't Christopher, he's good at locks, right?
4677320	4678320	He's a thief, isn't he?
4678320	4679320	True.
4679320	4680320	Yeah.
4680320	4683320	You know, but I don't know if I want to let these snakes out.
4683320	4684320	Right.
4684320	4685320	So does me.
4685320	4686320	It's like a song.
4686320	4689320	It's not a song, but I'm not sure.
4689320	4694820	I mean, but I mean, to keep things lively, I guess I'll move forward and open the lock
4694820	4696320	with my lock skills.
4696320	4697320	Okay.
4697320	4698320	Lock undoing skills.
4698320	4701520	Before you can head to the lock, Mulrane, out of the corner of your eye, you can see
4701520	4705320	snakes pouring out of a few of the holes to the southwest.
4705320	4706320	Eyes.
4706320	4707320	All right.
4707320	4710320	Mulrane, don't you have, like, animal husbandry or something?
4710320	4711320	You can...
4711320	4712320	Hey, can't we just climb back up the staff?
4712320	4713320	I do.
4713320	4714320	Why don't you could?
4714320	4715320	I have...
4715320	4716320	Hmm.
4716320	4717320	Actually, I don't know...
4717320	4720320	You hear a rumbling overhead.
4720320	4722320	I have a handle animal.
4722320	4724320	Let's just get that out.
4724320	4726320	Can I use handle animal with the snakes?
4726320	4727320	Definitely.
4727320	4728320	I use handle animal.
4728320	4730320	I handle the snakes.
4730320	4732320	I handle all those animals.
4732320	4733320	Okay.
4733320	4738880	And then I pitch a kid's show to Nickelodeon called Handle Animals.
4738880	4741040	You attempt to handle the snake.
4741040	4744760	It rises up and seems to be swaying slowly from side to side.
4744760	4745760	Sexy.
4745760	4748040	You hear hissing behind you.
4748040	4751440	Uh, cool?
4751440	4752440	I turn around.
4752440	4753440	I think they want to dance to you.
4753440	4755520	You see a few more snakes pouring out of the hole.
4755520	4756520	All right.
4756520	4758520	Handle animals is what we would need.
4758520	4759520	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
4759520	4762840	Is this mushroom possibly something that we could use in some way?
4763840	4765840	I thought at first I should take a bite.
4765840	4767840	Open the fucking door.
4767840	4768840	Unlock the door.
4768840	4771840	I was trying to, but then the snakes started coming out.
4771840	4772840	Well, that's fine.
4772840	4773840	I have a sack.
4773840	4774840	I have a sack.
4774840	4778840	I take my sack and I hold it up to the holes.
4778840	4780840	And I'm also handling the animals.
4780840	4782840	I handle them into my sack.
4782840	4784840	I'm going to open the...
4784840	4786840	We're still talking about jerking off.
4786840	4787840	I'm going to undo the...
4787840	4791840	So on your skills, there should be something on the other page, not that one.
4791840	4794840	On the right side of this page, there should be something that says,
4794840	4796840	open lock, and then there should be a number somewhere.
4796840	4797840	The right side, yeah.
4797840	4798840	All right.
4798840	4799840	I'm looking, looking, looking.
4799840	4800840	It's a hundred.
4800840	4802840	Okay, it's 13, it says.
4802840	4803840	Awesome, okay.
4803840	4804840	That's small modifier.
4804840	4805840	Yeah, 13.
4805840	4806840	Skill modifier.
4806840	4809840	You start picking the lock.
4809840	4811840	It's going to take a bit.
4811840	4812840	Here we go.
4812840	4814840	As this happens, you guys, you feel...
4814840	4817840	You hear the weird sound of sprawing florp.
4817840	4819840	Sprawing florp.
4819840	4823840	A green cloud of smoke is emitted from the room and standing where the snakes were.
4823840	4826840	You see several green humanoid figures.
4826840	4827840	Jesus Christ.
4827840	4828840	They're holding bows.
4828840	4829840	Spuddies.
4829840	4830840	They're holding bows already.
4830840	4832840	What are you doing in our inner sanctum?
4832840	4833840	I'll handle this.
4833840	4834840	All the snake people.
4834840	4837840	Oh, fair travelers.
4837840	4839840	We come in peace.
4839840	4843840	We have traveled far and wide to give you homage.
4843840	4848840	We come here only to extend to you the utmost privilege and courtesy.
4848840	4850840	Oh, thank God we found you.
4850840	4855840	Because we've heard about you forever and we're just huge fans.
4855840	4857840	Do you have diplomacy, Dan?
4857840	4858840	Yeah.
4858840	4860840	It would be on that first page.
4860840	4861840	I have diplomacy, too.
4861840	4863840	So do you want to also say stuff?
4863840	4864840	Yeah, I say I'm with him.
4864840	4865840	You guys are...
4865840	4867840	Thanks for having us.
4867840	4869840	Can I say something?
4869840	4870840	I have something to add to this.
4870840	4872840	Wait, are you done?
4872840	4873840	Yeah.
4873840	4874840	Don't kill the lily.
4874840	4875840	Let's just...
4875840	4877840	Yeah, let's see what they say.
4877840	4878840	You can go ahead, Abbott.
4878840	4880840	I was just going to say, are they 80s fans?
4880840	4881840	I'll play them a song.
4881840	4883840	Where's diplomacy, Spencer, on my front page?
4883840	4886840	It's on the right side where your skills are.
4886840	4887840	It's alphabetical.
4887840	4888840	Okay, okay, okay.
4888840	4889840	Okay, I don't.
4889840	4890840	You can still do it.
4890840	4891840	You just aren't as good.
4891840	4894840	Can I use my hat as a disguise and make myself a green person?
4894840	4895840	Yeah, definitely.
4895840	4896840	That's a good one.
4896840	4897840	Okay, I do that.
4897840	4899840	You'll have to do it stealthily to evade detection.
4899840	4901840	I do it stealthily.
4901840	4903840	You do it stealthily to evade detection.
4903840	4905840	Are they threatening us?
4905840	4907840	They're holding bows drawn at you, yeah.
4907840	4911840	Well, I'm going to say, look, it's your cousin from Longafar,
4911840	4913840	and she misses you guys.
4913840	4920840	Why haven't you wrote scrolls detailing how you're doing to her?
4920840	4921840	Actually, they are pointing arrows.
4921840	4922840	I'll tone it down.
4922840	4923840	Anyway, this is your cousin.
4923840	4926840	Well, you fucking cool it.
4926840	4928840	Everybody's talking at once.
4928840	4931840	It doesn't seem very convincing, but then...
4931840	4934840	I take my emerald green dagger and I go over to Mulray
4934840	4936840	and disguise as one of these green people, and I say,
4936840	4937840	Mulray, this is not going to be what it looks like.
4937840	4939840	I'm going to pretend that we're holding you as a hostage
4939840	4941840	because you look like one of them,
4941840	4942840	but I'm not going to do anything bad.
4942840	4944840	So I put my dagger up to Mulray and start to go,
4944840	4948840	hey, open that door and let us through, or your friend gets it.
4948840	4949840	He means it.
4949840	4951840	You hear the voice of the dagger call out,
4951840	4953840	hey, hey, snake dudes.
4953840	4955840	This guy's totally lying.
4955840	4956840	It's a trick.
4956840	4957840	That dagger, man.
4957840	4959840	Why would my dagger do that?
4959840	4961840	Because it's an intelligent item, and you haven't...
4961840	4963840	Okay, I put the dagger away.
4963840	4964840	I take a sword out.
4964840	4966840	It doesn't talk back.
4966840	4967840	That's true.
4967840	4969840	Okay, I take my sword out.
4969840	4973840	Listen, that's the thing I got at a Renaissance fair.
4973840	4975840	It's not going to...
4975840	4976840	Anyhoo.
4976840	4977840	Who's sling?
4977840	4980840	I take my sword out, and I hold it up to Mulray and disguise,
4980840	4983840	and I say, yeah, open that door.
4983840	4985840	Your friend gets it.
4985840	4987840	What's your diplomacy, Jeff?
4987840	4989840	My diplomacy is 10 with a...
4989840	4991840	With a minor in theology.
4992840	4995840	This is 10, then 3, then 7, whatever that means.
4995840	4997840	10 equals 3 plus 7.
4997840	4999840	Yeah, okay. That makes sense.
4999840	5001840	So it's math.
5001840	5003840	Sometimes it's math.
5003840	5005840	You seem convincing.
5005840	5006840	He moles...
5006840	5009840	The lead snake person moles over the options.
5009840	5011840	I use intimidate, too.
5011840	5012840	Well, you got to pick one.
5012840	5014840	So diplomacy or intimidate?
5014840	5015840	Shit.
5015840	5016840	Intimidate.
5016840	5017840	Intimidate.
5017840	5018840	Okay.
5022840	5024840	He stops for it, and he's like, wait a second.
5024840	5026840	You shouldn't kill one of our own.
5026840	5027840	Probably.
5027840	5029840	Also, I'm frightened.
5029840	5032840	Oh, snake people.
5032840	5037840	Oh, so superior because your backs bend in different ways.
5037840	5040840	We of the primates just come to pay honor to you
5040840	5045840	for your blood runs cold and your hearts are but two chambers.
5045840	5048840	Or maybe even one. I can't remember.
5048840	5050840	It's true, brethren.
5050840	5051840	I came upon them.
5051840	5055840	They were making posters paying homage to our people.
5055840	5057840	We're just here to hang out.
5057840	5058840	The lead power one.
5058840	5059840	We love lizard people.
5059840	5062840	He seems lizard people, yeah.
5062840	5063840	That was bad, right?
5063840	5065840	Yeah, no, that's insulting, in fact.
5065840	5066840	Oh, no.
5066840	5068840	He seems a bit enamored by your speech
5068840	5072840	after being frightened by the known barbarians.
5072840	5074840	We got to get the same page here, you guys.
5074840	5076840	We're sending mixed messages.
5076840	5078840	But the snake man to the left,
5078840	5080840	he looks a bit unstable.
5080840	5081840	Uh-oh.
5081840	5084840	He freaks out and he hits the one in the middle.
5084840	5085840	Fuck it.
5085840	5087840	They're hitting each other.
5087840	5090840	One of the guy, he jabs them sharply in the ribs.
5090840	5092840	He's like, hey, get a frigging grip.
5092840	5093840	Oh, I see.
5093840	5094840	Let's keep it safe.
5094840	5095840	Okay.
5095840	5097840	Oh, look at this guy over here.
5097840	5100840	I walk over to him and go, what's with this guy, huh?
5100840	5101840	I walk around.
5101840	5103840	I go before that happens.
5103840	5105840	The one on the left says, hey, hold it.
5105840	5106840	Hold it.
5106840	5107840	Hold it.
5107840	5108840	Hold it.
5108840	5109840	It's cold.
5109840	5110840	It's cold.
5110840	5111840	It's cold.
5111840	5113840	I'm just saying, let's get along.
5113840	5118840	I'm relying on my elongated S's to woo them into—
5118840	5119840	Pretty tricky.
5119840	5120840	Hey, everybody.
5120840	5127840	Let's just say we're just here to service the idea of getting along.
5127840	5128840	Nice.
5128840	5129840	Give me more of these words.
5129840	5133840	While he's doing that, I walk around one of the, the agitated snake guy,
5133840	5137840	and I get down on my hands and knees like a Hope and Crosby kind of thing, or—
5137840	5145840	Because at the end of the days, all we are is just a bunch of slaves to working for the weekend,
5145840	5146840	and I push them.
5146840	5148840	Uh-oh.
5148840	5153840	For a second, you don't think this half-assed plan is going to work.
5153840	5158840	But Quark, being naturally sneaky, manages to crawl into position,
5158840	5160840	thinking fast or whatever you had mentioned.
5160840	5162840	You push him over Quark.
5162840	5163840	All right, you see what happened there?
5163840	5166840	The rest of you following the fucking liner will trip you, too.
5166840	5170840	They shoot arrows at you.
5170840	5174840	The arrows hit, and you feel a bit woozy,
5174840	5177840	as if there was something coating the poison in those arrows.
5177840	5178840	Uh-oh.
5178840	5179840	Oh, no.
5179840	5180840	Tricky business indeed.
5180840	5181840	Who was hit, Spencer?
5181840	5182840	It hit.
5182840	5184840	Both of the arrows hit Dan.
5184840	5185840	Oh, shit.
5185840	5186840	Oh, no.
5186840	5190840	I, like, fire flames in my eyes.
5190840	5193840	I take out my arrows.
5193840	5198840	I fire two arrows at the snake people,
5198840	5200840	and they're looking at me like, what?
5200840	5201840	You're one of them?
5201840	5204840	But I do it.
5204840	5206840	Nice.
5206840	5208840	So what kind of arrows?
5208840	5210840	The perfect ones.
5210840	5211840	Obsidian.
5211840	5212840	Obsidian.
5212840	5213840	Vero.
5213840	5214840	Vero.
5214840	5215840	With a woody feel.
5215840	5216840	The Vero.
5216840	5217840	Cedar.
5217840	5218840	Yeah, okay.
5218840	5219840	Cedar, okay.
5219840	5220840	Two Vero's.
5220840	5221840	Two Vero's.
5221840	5223840	Okay, so are you shooting them at one person or two people?
5223840	5225840	I'm the two most dangerous.
5225840	5226840	Two people.
5226840	5227840	Okay, so you fire at them.
5227840	5228840	Two people.
5228840	5229840	Yes.
5229840	5231840	Both of their arrows strike their mark.
5231840	5232840	All right.
5232840	5233840	Oh, nice.
5233840	5236840	Quite the arch you are, you know?
5236840	5238840	Your regular green arrow.
5238840	5239840	Thank you.
5239840	5241840	One of them takes seven damage, the other three.
5241840	5243840	I stand up into a flaming sword attack
5243840	5245840	on the other snake person.
5245840	5247840	Leaping quickly to your feet.
5247840	5250840	You grab your sword and thrust it viciously into the...
5250840	5251840	Which one did you say?
5251840	5254840	The one that we knocked over.
5254840	5255840	The one that's on the ground.
5255840	5257840	The knocked over one.
5257840	5259840	With my, like, loot or mandolin, whatever,
5259840	5262840	can I, like, score the whole action scene?
5262840	5264840	As they're doing all that, I'm like, have a loot?
5264840	5265840	Do you have a loot?
5265840	5266840	If you do, it should be...
5266840	5267840	Yeah, well...
5267840	5268840	You could potentially.
5268840	5269840	I have to have some kind of instrument.
5269840	5271840	Or you could get in the fucking fight, Christoperg.
5271840	5274840	No, I mean, I just want...
5274840	5276840	Yeah, I mean, all right.
5276840	5278840	I'll help my homie out and, you know,
5278840	5279840	claw him on the head or something.
5279840	5280840	Arrows?
5280840	5281840	You have a bow.
5281840	5283840	Yeah, I'll use my bow and shoot arrows also.
5283840	5284840	All right, well...
5284840	5285840	At the last guy?
5285840	5288840	Quark with his, you know, his flaming sword
5288840	5291840	strikes the fallen snake.
5291840	5292840	He dies.
5292840	5293840	Oh, yeah.
5293840	5294840	Oh, nice.
5294840	5295840	Great job.
5295840	5296840	See? That's so hard.
5296840	5297840	You dealt 19 damage.
5297840	5298840	Fuck, yeah.
5298840	5299840	Quite a feat.
5299840	5300840	Oh, man.
5300840	5301840	Do we get, like, points and shit?
5301840	5303840	Experience ones, yes.
5303840	5305840	Yeah, that's cool.
5305840	5307840	Okay, so now do the thing that you're gonna do.
5307840	5309840	Wait, divide it among us or does he get them all?
5309840	5310840	Oh, it's divided.
5310840	5311840	Don't you worry.
5311840	5312840	Yeah.
5312840	5313840	I'll take care of you.
5313840	5314840	That's cool, man.
5314840	5315840	I got some points.
5315840	5317840	You were gonna do something, though, with a bow, maybe?
5317840	5318840	What was it?
5318840	5319840	Me?
5319840	5320840	Yeah.
5320840	5321840	Oh, well, there's nothing left to do.
5321840	5322840	No, no, there's just two other guys.
5322840	5323840	Oh, shit, that's right.
5323840	5325840	Well, I will shoot...
5325840	5328840	I got to divide experience points with this guy?
5328840	5329840	I'm gonna...
5329840	5330840	Sorry.
5330840	5333840	I'm gonna, like, shoot one bow, like, really fast.
5333840	5334840	Like, one bow, one guy, one bow with the other guy.
5334840	5335840	I mean, arrow.
5335840	5336840	Okay, so you can only shoot one arrow.
5336840	5338840	And I stand behind Chris and I cross my arms
5338840	5340840	and I nod my head as if I taught him everything he knows.
5340840	5341840	But I know I didn't.
5341840	5342840	But it looks like I did.
5342840	5343840	Well, you can shoot one arrow.
5343840	5345840	So pick a target, left or right.
5345840	5346840	Oh, okay.
5346840	5348840	I mean, I guess you always go left.
5348840	5350840	You know, well, maybe right.
5350840	5351840	I'll go left.
5351840	5352840	I'll go left.
5352840	5353840	My first answer seems right.
5353840	5354840	Yeah, yeah.
5354840	5358840	Your arrow strikes true, hitting the snake right in the chest.
5358840	5360840	Oh, yeah.
5360840	5362840	It deals 10 damage.
5362840	5363840	All right.
5363840	5365840	The snake goes down.
5365840	5366840	All right.
5366840	5369840	The other snake freaks out and turns into a snake,
5369840	5371840	an actual snake this time,
5371840	5373840	and slithers away into the hole behind.
5373840	5374840	Ah.
5374840	5375840	I want to stop him.
5375840	5376840	Step on him.
5376840	5377840	Do you want to try and stop him?
5377840	5379840	Yeah, I want to grab him.
5379840	5380840	What's your dexterity?
5380840	5382840	Oh, that's not looking good, man.
5382840	5384840	14 plus 2, it says.
5384840	5385840	Plus 2, yeah.
5385840	5388840	He manages to worm away.
5388840	5390840	I whip him.
5390840	5391840	It's too heavy.
5391840	5392840	I like your thought.
5392840	5393840	Can I make a...
5393840	5394840	I whip him.
5394840	5395840	I use my whip.
5395840	5396840	Okay.
5396840	5397840	Your magical whip.
5397840	5398840	Okay.
5398840	5399840	So it's going to take a minor action,
5399840	5402840	and then you whip.
5402840	5403840	You missed.
5403840	5405840	So, well, there you go.
5405840	5407840	Chris, while we were fighting these people,
5407840	5409840	did you have any luck opening that door?
5409840	5410840	That's true.
5410840	5413840	In this time, the door has now been unlocked.
5413840	5414840	Ah.
5414840	5415840	All right.
5415840	5417840	Earn some points there.
5417840	5420840	I opened the door and peered through it.
5420840	5423840	You peered through the open door.
5423840	5425840	No, what's happening?
5425840	5427840	As you open the door to the threshold,
5427840	5430840	you are assaulted by the sharp abrasive smell
5430840	5431840	of the chamber air.
5431840	5434840	Thick and heavy, but clawing at your eyes and nose.
5434840	5437840	A sharp tang of vinegar and incredibly pungent sour aroma
5437840	5439840	invades your senses.
5439840	5442840	We're in the drawing room.
5442840	5444840	You can see a large stone chamber in the center
5444840	5447840	of which is three large humanoid statues
5447840	5449840	that are beginning to crumble.
5449840	5452840	Next, behind the statues is a large staircase
5452840	5455840	leading up about 80 feet high in tiered steps.
5455840	5457840	At the top, you can see chests and barrels
5457840	5459840	and what appear to be a massive sarcophagus
5459840	5463840	made of obsidian surrounded by several forms of tribute.
5463840	5464840	Gold.
5464840	5465840	Heaps of gold.
5465840	5466840	Rich.
5466840	5470840	I turn to Sharpie, and I start to do a high five.
5470840	5472840	I go, not again.
5472840	5475840	It's in the way that you use it.
5475840	5476840	Credit starts to roll.
5476840	5477840	Yeah, freeze frame.
5477840	5478840	Credit, yeah.
5478840	5479840	We'll divvy up that treasure.
5479840	5480840	Cliffhanger.
5480840	5481840	Cliffhanger.
5481840	5482840	Yeah.
5482840	5487840	Spencer, everybody, once again.
5487840	5489840	Aaron McGathey.
5489840	5490840	Abed Gaeth.
5490840	5492840	Abed Gaeth.
5492840	5495840	Abed, tiny food Gaeth.
5495840	5498840	Thank you, Abed.
5498840	5500840	Enjoy those fashion beasts.
5500840	5501840	I will.
5501840	5503840	I'll let you know what it's like.
5503840	5504840	That was an all right show.
5504840	5507840	I'll give that a Burbank eight.
5508840	5509840	A Burbank eight?
5509840	5512840	Yeah, you know, Burbank, you lower it, you know.
5512840	5513840	Like, you know.
5513840	5515840	Oh, what the fuck?
5515840	5517840	Oh, shit.
5517840	5518840	Wait.
5518840	5519840	God damn it.
5519840	5520840	This is going to be hard to describe
5520840	5523840	for the podcast listeners.
5523840	5525840	An apparition just appeared on stage.
5525840	5527840	It's our good friend BJ, everybody.
5527840	5529840	BJ.
5529840	5532840	BJ, briefly, briefly, for the people listening
5532840	5536840	in Indiana and whatnot, BJ comes on stage wearing pink leopard
5536840	5538840	or cheetah jaguar.
5538840	5539840	What is that?
5539840	5540840	Trousers.
5540840	5541840	It's a pink leopard.
5541840	5542840	A pink leopard.
5542840	5543840	Trousers.
5543840	5544840	Rainbow bright moon boots.
5544840	5547840	Yeah, Punky Brewsters, Giant Shoes.
5547840	5548840	Yeah, thank you.
5548840	5550840	They're not strawberry shortcake boots,
5550840	5552840	as previously said by someone not here.
5552840	5554840	And there's a red tartan jacket,
5554840	5558840	an open shirt, hairy chest, a colorful scarf.
5558840	5561840	BJ, how should we end the show?
5561840	5565840	I traveled back all the way from the future
5565840	5569840	just to figure out how to end this show.
5569840	5570840	How about with a song?
5570840	5572840	What's the future like, BJ?
5572840	5574840	Yeah, it's bright.
5574840	5576840	Because the sun's bigger?
5576840	5578840	There's more than one.
5578840	5579840	Well, it's two suns?
5579840	5581840	Two suns in the future.
5581840	5586840	One of them is ours.
5586840	5589840	Who does the other sun belong to?
5589840	5593840	The other sun belongs to Jeff.
5593840	5594840	And Jeff has a sun.
5594840	5596840	Jeff has a sun in the future.
5596840	5598840	Jeff has a sun.
5598840	5600840	A sun in the future.
5600840	5602840	I'm Jeff's son from the future.
5602840	5603840	I get my own sun in the future.
5603840	5604840	It's me.
5604840	5605840	It's me, Dad.
5605840	5606840	BJ's your son.
5606840	5607840	That's who I was all along.
5607840	5609840	BJ is Jeff's son.
5609840	5611840	In the future, BJ is Jeff's son.
5611840	5613840	This is as far as I can get because of the cord.
5613840	5616840	Jeff's story has just begun.
5616840	5617840	Sorry, technology.
5617840	5619840	In the future, BJ is Jeff's son.
5619840	5620840	It's OK.
5620840	5621840	Thanks for catching me.
5621840	5622840	And Jeff adopted himself.
5622840	5623840	People from the present?
5623840	5626840	He put his sperm on a shelf.
5626840	5628840	He impregnated himself.
5628840	5631840	And BJ is the resultant answer.
5631840	5634840	Wait, so I have a son that lives in the future?
5634840	5635840	Yes.
5635840	5637840	And he's part you, part you.
5637840	5639840	There is no woman involved.
5639840	5640840	You finally achieved your dream.
5640840	5641840	It's 100% you.
5641840	5643840	In the future, it's possible for you to have your dream.
5643840	5646840	You can procreate without having to involve any woman.
5646840	5649840	But how did he go to the future and come back now?
5649840	5651840	Because he's part you and part you,
5651840	5653840	he's so smart he can invent time travel.
5653840	5655840	But is he also a stellar body?
5655840	5657840	There's two sons.
5657840	5659840	One is the actual star that we call our son.
5659840	5662840	He is your son and his wardrobe choices are so radiant
5662840	5667840	that he actually is defined as a solar body.
5667840	5668840	So he's the future me.
5668840	5669840	Yeah.
5669840	5670840	I throw out the shackles.
5670840	5677840	And the future you is a star.
5677840	5680840	Just like the sun.
5680840	5682840	And the future you likes to drink.
5682840	5683840	Just like you.
5683840	5685840	Because drinking is so much fun.
5685840	5689840	I love my future gay son.
5689840	5690840	Harman Tan.
5690840	5693840	Thank you for coming to Harman Tan, everybody.

5714840	5717840	My foam sword is shiny and sharp.
5717840	5721840	I'll fuck your mama like life according to Garp.
5721840	5726840	I'll fuck your mama in Harman Tan all day.
5726840	5729840	Jeff's son's already gay.
5729840	5730840	I'm Jeff Davis.
5730840	5733840	One more time for Dan Harman, everybody.

5741840	5742840	I'll fuck your mama.
5742840	5746840	I'll fuck your mama on a plate and a bowl.
5746840	5749840	I'll fuck your mama till her face got a mole.
5749840	5753840	I'll fuck your mama dermatologically speaking.
