0	23520	It's a beautiful Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, and the fantastically groovy comedy theatre
23520	26200	brought to you by the Wheeler Center.
27200	31200	Look guys, we were in Brisbane last night, so this is like being in Paris or Rome.
33200	36200	Germantown is now in session.
43200	49200	Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure and my honor to introduce to you Spencer Crittenden.
56200	58200	Oh shit!
60200	62200	What up?
64200	68200	And the mayor of Germantown, Dan Harmon.
75200	79200	Thank you. Thank you so much.
80200	83200	This is exhilarating. Thank you. Melbourne.
83200	84200	We did it.
84200	88200	I find it hard. I don't want to cross the threshold where you start.
88200	92200	It's like when you're the Melbourne thing, like it's Melbourne to me.
92200	100200	I know it's not to you, but then it's like within the movies when the first time the teenage daughter calls the adopted dad, dad, you know.
100200	105200	Like I feel like if we went through an earthquake together and then I helped you make a tourniquet or something,
105200	110200	and then there were like werewolves and then we finished and we were the only survivors, it was just me and you.
110200	114200	And then you'd be like, thanks Dan. And I'd be like, thanks Melbourne.
117200	121200	Because I was always like chewing my gum and calling you Melbourne the whole time.
121200	129200	Did Dan spend I think 85% of last night's show in Brisbane just hurrying the audience about your guys' accents?
129200	132200	No, I mean mistakes were made last night.
133200	137200	I came out in the hat and the shorts and the...
138200	141200	I don't know who started it and what made the show as...
141200	146200	The brow of the show was lower last night and it wasn't Brisbane's fault.
146200	150200	But it was like a cool rock and roll hanger. I don't know if everyone's been to the Trifids in Brisbane.
150200	153200	It's an awesome venue, but it's like more of a rock concert.
153200	158200	This is a very civilized theater kind of thing, but it was like a prison riot.
158200	163200	Everybody was yelling at each other. They all hated where everybody else was from.
163200	166200	It was really barbaric.
166200	171200	This is not a classist thing, but have you guys seen the movie Gremlins?
173200	180200	No, no, I'm kidding. It was more like, we've done shows in Madison and Milwaukee, my hometown.
180200	184200	I don't know, maybe it's like...
184200	190200	It was like they were watching TV and they were just like all of them, they were just like, no, that's not true.
191200	195200	It often isn't true what I say. I shouldn't be saying anything I'm saying.
195200	203200	So if 700 people are each individually monitoring that and calling out to me, that's actually not true.
203200	205200	Okay, all right. Well, that's okay.
205200	210200	And then some poor fucker admitted that he was from Ipswich and there was a...
211200	214200	They nearly crucified him.
215200	222200	It got ugly, but then we all like, I took a bunch of like the young harmonians, because you crapped out, you were pooped.
222200	226200	I was so exhausted. Listen, if you guys ever see me...
226200	234200	I'm not going to say I was unprepared for last night and the amount of effort it would take to do a transcontinental version of this show.
234200	243200	But if you ever see me initiate a game of audience sound effects, which is what I did last night...
243200	245200	We went straight up whose lens anyway last night.
245200	249200	I was just looking at Jeff like, I don't know, maybe...
249200	254200	Do we have a celebrity on the phone? Like I didn't really know what to do.
254200	257200	It was my fault because I came out dressed like Paul Hogan.
257200	264200	I came out dressed like a fucking lunatic and I was obsessed with the accent and I was trying to prove I could do the accent.
264200	272200	I spent hours... It wasn't an insulting... I was so proud because I finally figured out how to say...
273200	276200	I like that hat might...
278200	286200	That's all the vowels, except for somebody... Spencer and I still don't know how to do O's.
286200	288200	We still don't know how to do O's.
288200	290200	What's the rule with O here?
290200	293200	You gotta go like, no.
293200	296200	No!
296200	298200	No!
298200	299200	Yeah, that's Jeff had it.
299200	300200	That's perfect.
300200	301200	But now we're doing it again.
301200	303200	It's gonna turn into Jerry Springer.
303200	310200	You guys don't know how many times Dan said, I like that hat mate!
310200	313200	Because it was 120.
313200	315200	It was a lot of times.
315200	317200	Why did you do it?
317200	318200	It's so stressed.
318200	319200	Because I'm concentrating on each thing.
319200	320200	I know it says...
320200	321200	You gotta be laid back.
321200	324200	They have a playful, relaxed thing.
324200	325200	You're not supposed to...
325200	329200	It's supposed to flow over your tongue like a medicine ball or something.
329200	330200	You know how those flows...
330200	333200	So far, I like that hat mate!
333200	335200	And then it's like, there's all these rules.
335200	336200	It has to go up.
336200	337200	It has to be a question.
337200	338200	I'm doing it again.
338200	340200	This is how I started the show in Brisbane.
340200	342200	And I'm not gonna say it was a bad show.
342200	343200	It was a great show.
343200	344200	It was a very Brisbane show.
344200	345200	It was a great show, but the inmates...
345200	346200	We had a good time.
346200	348200	The inmates were running the prison last night.
348200	352200	And they're smart, wonderful, jocular, jolly inmates.
352200	355200	They were not bad people.
356200	359200	To be fair, half of them were from Ipswich.
360200	361200	Fucking animals.
364200	371200	But now we are, according to Joseph Campbell's tracking of our journey, we're now at the meeting with the goddess.
371200	373200	We're in the taint of Australia.
373200	375200	We're down under.
375200	378200	We're down around and under.
378200	380200	I'm sure I'm not the first person to point this out.
380200	384200	Maybe we can get on a boat and cradle the balls of Tasmania.
386200	389200	And we're in this wonderful historic theater.
389200	393200	This theater, Dan, is where the typewriter was invented.
397200	402200	There was a guy downstairs that's running the Wheeler thing or whatever.
402200	403200	The Wheeler Center, yes.
403200	405200	The Wheeler brothers.
405200	413200	They're in a huge feud, but they can only get along during these fine showcases of artistic...
413200	415200	I don't know what the Wheeler thing is.
415200	416200	I don't know what it is.
416200	421200	The Wheeler Center is another theater that they use when they have big venues.
421200	425200	Big shows like this, they hire out the comedy theater that we're in right now.
425200	427200	Big shows like us.
427200	431200	He was saying that it's not this theater, but that down the street there's a theater.
431200	437200	I thought he'd say, he said, Max Wayne performed down there.
437200	438200	Max Wayne.
438200	442200	And I was like, oh, Max Wayne, he clearly needs me to pretend to know who that is.
442200	443200	He'll think I'm stupid.
443200	445200	He was saying Mark Twain.
448200	449200	I would never...
449200	452200	I love you guys, but we'll never understand each other.
452200	456200	I asked him who the name of the Prime Minister was, and I thought he said something turtle.
459200	460200	It's Daniel Andrews.
460200	461200	No, no.
462200	463200	That's the premier.
463200	464200	That's the premier.
464200	465200	Who were you asking about?
465200	466200	The PM.
467200	468200	Oh, the Prime Minister.
468200	470200	That's Pauline Henson.
471200	472200	Hello.
475200	476200	Come on, Hulkamaniacs.
476200	477200	Let me hear you.
478200	482200	Yeah, I got my hooks into Pauline Henson last night and I coasted across that finish line.
483200	484200	Thank you for that.
484200	485200	Ripcord.
485200	486200	I was sweating.
487200	488200	There's no show.
488200	489200	I have no show.
489200	490200	Audience sound effects.
490200	494200	And then someone mentioned Pauline Henson, and it was like, aha.
494200	499200	And Dan started doing a rap about liking that hat mate, and he went out into the crowd
499200	501200	and then went upstairs into the balcony.
501200	505200	And when he came back, he looked like he had just gotten out of the shower.
506200	507200	Yeah, I was just covered.
507200	511200	And I don't know how much of that was flop sweat and how much was just exercise.
511200	512200	It was kind of humid.
512200	513200	I think it was very much both.
513200	514200	I was like...
514200	518200	Again, not a bad show, but totally got to experience what it would be like.
518200	519200	You don't have an act.
519200	520200	What if you were in Brisbane?
520200	521200	You don't know.
522200	523200	I didn't know what that meant.
523200	524200	They were like, come on.
524200	526200	Hey, my name is Henry.
527200	529200	I was like, okay, Henry, what do you need?
529200	531200	I like shoes.
531200	533200	I was like, fine.
533200	535200	But then someone else would be like, you don't like shoes.
535200	536200	You like socks.
538200	541200	Well, Henry, I don't know what to do.
541200	542200	Let's just all eat paste.
542200	543200	I think that...
545200	546200	That sounded reductive.
546200	547200	That's not what I mean.
547200	550200	I mean, I'm talking about my ability to control the room.
550200	551200	I'm not talking about Brisbane's...
551200	552200	Yeah, Dan and I...
552200	555200	Dan, we don't like when the audience is drunker than us, and that was the case last night.
556200	558200	No, they were funnier and smarter.
558200	560200	They were like an oceanographer.
560200	561200	You bailed.
561200	566200	Yeah, we met a woman that kills Crown of Thorns starfish with a giant robot dick.
566200	567200	Yeah.
567200	571200	And it's done killing the starfish, so now they just gave it sentience.
571200	573200	Like, it sounds like they just...
573200	577200	Now they just told it to go kill more things and turned it loose in the ocean.
577200	579200	Maybe they were drunk.
580200	582200	But I went out with the gang of them.
582200	587200	We went out and did karaoke, and 30 of us piled into a room built for nine people,
587200	589200	and it was really good.
589200	592200	And I woke up and just had pockets full of drugs, and I was like,
592200	595200	I'm getting on a plane in two hours.
597200	599200	So I did all of them.
602200	603200	Thank you.
604200	607200	And definitely for real, I feel like a real Australian,
607200	609200	because there's a weird bump on my forehead.
609200	611200	Something definitely got me last night.
612200	614200	I don't think you can see it, but I know it.
614200	616200	You got a red jacket? What are they called?
616200	618200	I got a flip-flap or a red stripe or something,
618200	620200	like last to golly-knobbin down my wainscoting.
620200	621200	I don't know.
622200	623200	Something got me.
623200	625200	It's the ones you can't see that'll fucking kill you, right?
625200	626200	You know that.
626200	628200	That's how you welcome us here.
628200	629200	Welcome to Australia.
629200	632200	There hasn't been a spider death in 30 years.
632200	634200	No one else knows that.
635200	637200	That sounds like a lie.
637200	639200	You guys just reshuffle the statistics.
639200	640200	All right.
640200	641200	Again, I'm doing what I did last night.
641200	644200	I'm making them feel like they're just Australian.
644200	645200	Can I take a moment?
645200	646200	They're individuals.
646200	647200	You guys are human beings.
647200	649200	You listen to the podcast.
649200	651200	I could sit up here and talk about random shit.
651200	653200	Like, what the fuck is a bishop?
653200	656200	I don't know what a bishop is within the Catholic Church.
656200	657200	I don't understand.
658200	659200	I looked it up, and I can't...
659200	660200	There's a whole internet.
660200	661200	I don't even know what it is still.
661200	662200	A bishop?
662200	663200	A bishop, yeah.
663200	667200	I always thought it was like being a lieutenant in the Catholic Army.
668200	671200	Like, there's priests, like, street priests, you know?
672200	674200	The ones that get down in there.
674200	675200	Yeah.
675200	676200	Oh, yeah.
676200	677200	They really do.
677200	679200	Hey, innuendo, Nintendo.
681200	683200	See, I can speak Italian to you guys.
683200	684200	You're cosmopolitan.
685200	688200	But then there's, like, bishops and cardinals and then the pope.
688200	689200	Archbishops.
689200	691200	Yeah, archbishops, yeah.
691200	693200	But bishops can get married.
693200	694200	I don't know.
694200	695200	What the fuck?
695200	698200	And I looked it up because I watched a movie called The Bishop's Wife,
698200	700200	and the whole time they're not explaining.
701200	702200	Why does he have a wife?
702200	706200	It's Cary Grant's an angel, and he just comes in and he goes,
706200	708200	like, I'm here to help you build the new church.
708200	710200	And the bishop's like, yeah, I like that.
710200	712200	And he's like, but do you like your wife?
712200	713200	And he's like, what?
713200	715200	Why are you talking about my wife?
715200	716200	Why are you looking at her like that?
716200	718200	And Cary Grant's like, like her.
718200	719200	I like her.
719200	722200	And the guy's like, okay, but you're going to help me get my church done, right?
722200	723200	And he's like, I don't know.
723200	724200	Do you like the church more than your wife?
724200	727200	Like, it's a crazy movie, but that's not the point.
727200	729200	Like, it's just like a weird couple of fantasy.
729200	730200	Is it Cary Grant?
730200	731200	A ghost in that one or something?
731200	732200	There's a ghost?
732200	733200	Is he a ghost? No.
733200	734200	No, he's an angel.
734200	735200	He's an angel.
735200	736200	I was just technically a ghost.
736200	737200	What's the difference?
737200	739200	An angel is a ghost, but you...
739200	741200	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
742200	748200	An angel is a holy creature created as a servant to the Lord.
749200	752200	A ghost is a departed spirit of the living.
753200	754200	Okay, all right, all right.
757200	761200	And that was Spencer Crittenden logic moments.
761200	765200	I have one wheelhouse, and it's knowing what monsters are.
766200	771200	Every once in a while, yeah, we stumble right into your garden and act like we own it.
771200	772200	I do.
773200	774200	That's all I got.
774200	777200	Well, all right, Spencer, where is Jeff going?
777200	778200	It's not important.
779200	780200	Let's ignore it.
780200	781200	Are you from...
785200	790200	For the listeners, Jeff is opening a bar at the side of the theater.
790200	794200	For those of you who are only listening, you'd think Jeff was from Ipswich right now.
795200	798200	Now he's going into the bar himself.
799200	801200	He found a bar.
802200	803200	Jeff found a bar.
803200	804200	I think a bouncer's coming.
805200	807200	Oh, and just one more thing about last night's show.
807200	812200	A disabled lady, which we brought up on stage, told me I needed to take care of myself and everyone applauded.
812200	815200	Yeah, well, that's going to keep happening.
816200	818200	That stuck with me.
818200	819200	Right.
819200	821200	I said she's had a terrible life.
821200	826200	She had a back injury, and she packs all fucked up, and I like to bring people up sometimes.
826200	828200	I'm like, who's having a terrible time?
828200	829200	And she shared all this stuff.
829200	832200	And then I was like, oh, well, can we give you...
832200	836200	Within our means, is there anything we could do since you shared your pain with us?
836200	839200	Yeah, can you lose some fucking weight, fatty?
839200	841200	Do us all a favor.
841200	843200	Get on a goddamn treadmill.
844200	846200	That was her pitch.
847200	855200	Dan, when I went down to this bar, for the listeners, there's a neon sign underneath the John Wilkes booth, like, overhang.
856200	860200	And it says bar, but it's pointing to just this ominous black curtain.
860200	863200	In there is a bar right off of stage right, audience left.
863200	864200	Right.
864200	865200	And I went down there.
865200	866200	I said, Mike?
866200	868200	Who's the cat that runs the Wheeler Center?
869200	870200	Huh?
870200	871200	It's Trick.
871200	872200	That's what she said.
873200	874200	John?
874200	875200	John Turtle?
876200	878200	He said, do we want an open?
878200	881200	He can send somebody down there and open up this bar.
883200	885200	For them?
885200	888200	They're reacting like you think for them.
889200	892200	Why are we wasting a bar at our show?
893200	896200	It's a chance to make the Wheeler Center some money, John.
899200	901200	I want 10% of this action.
902200	907200	We've performed in rooms where there's a bar. We haven't liked it.
907200	913200	People ordering drinks while you're trying to have an act.
913200	914200	Do you want me to go close the curtain?
914200	919200	Well, I'm going to go out there anyway, because we want to do a new segment.
923200	925200	Just that neon sign.
925200	928200	Is that just like art department or is there actually a thing there?
928200	931200	Also, I've never seen a bar that close to the stage.
931200	933200	That's really Australian.
935200	937200	That's what when Angela Lansbury is doing love letters,
937200	939200	you can just go get fucked up during the show?
939200	942200	That's the Australian, that's their fire department.
942200	944200	That's their code.
944200	945200	Yeah, they demand that.
945200	950200	I know about the brush fires.
950200	954200	I'm not being insensitive.
954200	956200	They have brush fires every week here, Jeff.
956200	958200	People die and it's awful.
958200	961200	They have a 9-11 like every 11.
968200	970200	Are you doing that in a way?
970200	972200	Are you sending out a signal?
972200	976200	I'm fun to pay attention to.
977200	980200	It's not like a SeaWorld show.
980200	986200	I'm not like a magician.
986200	989200	Usually what we do is we never have anybody up that doesn't want to be up
989200	991200	and then sometimes we ask for specific stuff and go,
991200	995200	oh, is there anybody in the thing that's, I don't know,
995200	998200	anybody have a terrible day or a good day, whatever.
998200	1001200	When we go out of town, a lot of people are like,
1001200	1003200	shit, the carnival's in town.
1003200	1004200	I want to just be on stage.
1004200	1007200	You're not a bad person for wanting that necessarily.
1007200	1009200	I'm kind of looking for some of those people
1009200	1013200	because we want to do a segment where we're going to just ask an Australian.
1013200	1017200	I want to run through a couple of people.
1017200	1019200	Your time will be limited but intense.
1019200	1021200	You won't be bullied.
1021200	1023200	Let's go with the very thin lumberjack.
1023200	1025200	It's clothing optional.
1025200	1026200	Yeah.
1026200	1028200	I like this guy's spirit.
1028200	1033200	He just looks like a Harman Town listener.
1033200	1035200	What's your name, sir?
1035200	1036200	What's your name?
1036200	1037200	Jackson.
1037200	1039200	Jackson is coming up.
1048200	1051200	All right, Jackson, you want to grab that?
1051200	1055200	For the listeners at home, Jackson looks like a police composite sketch of me
1055200	1058200	but saying he's attractive.
1064200	1066200	I thought you said crack dealer.
1066200	1067200	You said attractive.
1067200	1071200	Yeah, an attractive crack dealer.
1071200	1074200	All right, so what I also want to do with each guest we bring up is
1074200	1077200	I want to confirm your authenticity as an Australian.
1077200	1080200	So I've written some Australian phrases.
1080200	1081200	Right.
1081200	1084200	And we'll make sure when you read them.
1084200	1086200	Let's do that top one in boldface there.
1086200	1087200	You see that one?
1087200	1088200	Yeah, sure.
1088200	1090200	Word around the bushes, you stole my sonny.
1090200	1093200	He's prepared to die by knife.
1093200	1095200	Sounds pretty Australian to me.
1095200	1097200	But it ramped up a bit.
1097200	1099200	I put a little mustard on it.
1099200	1101200	You see how laid-back he is.
1101200	1103200	I know.
1103200	1104200	No, I'm not.
1104200	1105200	Guess what?
1105200	1106200	I'm not Australian.
1106200	1107200	I'm ashamed to tell you.
1107200	1108200	I said my dream.
1108200	1113200	Try to say that you like my hat in a laid-back fashion like Jackson here.
1113200	1116200	Oh, oh, Lord, that hat might.
1116200	1117200	It's getting there.
1117200	1118200	You're getting there.
1118200	1119200	Oh, Lord, that hat might.
1119200	1120200	Wait a second.
1120200	1121200	Why are you...
1121200	1122200	Because I'm concentrating on my bowels.
1122200	1123200	Who does that?
1123200	1124200	That's not a relaxed thing to do.
1124200	1125200	I have to concentrate.
1125200	1126200	They don't.
1126200	1127200	They're Australian.
1127200	1130200	I didn't come here to coach you guys.
1130200	1133200	But, you know, you kind of laid it on thick at the end.
1133200	1134200	All right.
1134200	1138200	You know, the eyes are always, but not in a cartoon way.
1138200	1139200	Have some respect.
1139200	1141200	Well, my accent is quite neutral as it is.
1141200	1144200	So I always feel self-conscious about not being Australian.
1144200	1145200	Right.
1145200	1148200	Well, isn't Brisbane more accent-y?
1148200	1149200	Yes.
1149200	1150200	Well, yeah.
1150200	1151200	Brisbane is a...
1151200	1152200	It's milder here.
1152200	1155200	Oh, and by the way, Brisbane is a big country town.
1155200	1158200	Oh, by the way, they don't tell you.
1158200	1161200	You're not supposed to tell them that.
1161200	1162200	They don't like it.
1162200	1165200	No one wants to be called a big country town.
1165200	1166200	Oh, we've got...
1166200	1170200	It's like a country town stitched together with several other country towns laid on top
1170200	1173200	of each other, because, oh, we've got things and junk.
1173200	1174200	Whoo!
1174200	1175200	Forget about it.
1175200	1176200	Well, if you're...
1176200	1180200	Sir, I happen to love Melbourne.
1180200	1181200	Melbourne's okay.
1181200	1183200	It's beautiful here.
1183200	1185200	It is beautiful.
1185200	1189200	Well, that brings me to the question.
1189200	1192200	Can you...
1192200	1196200	Why is it called capsicum?
1196200	1199200	They're bell peppers.
1199200	1200200	Is it...
1200200	1201200	I don't know.
1201200	1202200	I can't answer that.
1202200	1203200	I probably pronounced it stoop.
1203200	1204200	All right.
1204200	1205200	You want to pass on that question?
1205200	1207200	I don't know the answer to that one.
1207200	1208200	Okay.
1208200	1209200	All right.
1209200	1212200	Why was the Ferris wheel $6 million?
1212200	1219320	Well, I don't know why it cost $6 million, but I do know at one point this probably didn't
1219320	1220960	help with the budget.
1220960	1224200	It got really hot one year and it melted, basically.
1224200	1225200	It melted?
1225200	1226200	It melted?
1226200	1227200	Structurally unsound.
1228200	1229200	Wait, wait, wait.
1229200	1230200	The ferris wheel melted.
1230200	1231200	That's what the guy said.
1231200	1234200	It wasn't meant for summer weather or something.
1234200	1235200	Did it test it?
1235200	1236200	Yeah.
1236200	1237200	Yeah.
1237200	1238200	So it melted.
1238200	1239200	What part of it melted?
1239200	1240200	The whole thing.
1240200	1241200	But it buckled.
1241200	1242200	It started to warm.
1242200	1243200	It started to warm.
1243200	1244200	Jesus Christ.
1244200	1246200	Have you ever been on it, Jackson?
1246200	1247200	Have you ever ridden it?
1247200	1248200	No.
1248200	1252200	Not only that, but it overlooks the Docklands.
1252200	1255200	There's nothing to see there.
1255200	1257200	I've witnessed a shipping container.
1257200	1259200	Oh, the joy.
1259200	1261200	They had to move it, right?
1261200	1263200	They had to pick it up and move it at one point?
1263200	1264200	I don't know.
1264200	1265200	They moved to a Home Depot?
1265200	1269200	I think they were going to, but I think they just planned because there's nothing around
1269200	1270200	it.
1270200	1271200	I think they figured they'd build stuff around it.
1271200	1273200	In London they have one of those.
1273200	1276200	I don't know if that was what this is based on because it's called the Eye.
1276200	1277200	But smaller.
1277200	1279200	Is the London one smaller?
1279200	1281200	No, the London one's much bigger.
1281200	1283200	They're so fucking proud of it.
1283200	1286960	When you're American, you go to London and you're like, what is this shitty-ass thing?
1286960	1289200	And they're like, excuse me, governor?
1289200	1295200	They get, they bristle, like whether they're tea-drinking, uh, uh, uh, uh, lily, lily.
1295200	1297200	They were all up in arms about it at the beginning.
1297200	1299200	They thought it was an eyesore, but now they like it.
1299200	1300200	Same with the Eiffel Tower.
1300200	1302200	All the Parisians hated the Eiffel Tower.
1302200	1303200	You can't find it.
1303200	1305200	It happens that fast, huh?
1305200	1309200	Well, maybe you guys will love this little white chocolate Ferris wheeler.
1309200	1310200	Oh, yeah.
1310200	1311200	Yeah, because copy.
1311200	1312200	How long has it been here?
1312200	1316200	If the Eiffel Tower was second, I don't think people would have fallen in love with it after a while.
1316200	1320200	They'd have gone, yeah, no, it's still just a copy of the shittier thing.
1320200	1321200	Right.
1321200	1322200	How long has it been here?
1322200	1325200	I think it's been operating for two, three years.
1325200	1326200	Uh-huh.
1326200	1327200	But it's been under construction.
1327200	1334200	By applause, who has been on the, uh, three people?
1334200	1337200	Well, they're really recuperating that six million fast.
1337200	1338200	Oh, yeah.
1338200	1349200	Nobody's going on the Ferris wheel after they announce, uh, released notes, uh, fixed melting bug.
1349200	1351200	No one's buying that app.
1351200	1353200	I live in Los Angeles.
1353200	1354200	I've never been on the subway.
1354200	1355200	I'm not going.
1355200	1357200	There's earthquakes all the goddamn time.
1357200	1358200	You're not getting me into a hole.
1358200	1362200	Addressed a problem where the Ferris wheel melted.
1362200	1363200	All right.
1363200	1366200	Well, I'll give you a bonus one, uh, since you're all the way up here.
1366200	1369200	And, uh, this, but we just want to double confirm this.
1369200	1375200	So we were told at one point that in Queensland, I know now we're in Victoria.
1375200	1380200	We were told that in Queensland that Jeff is slang for finger banging.
1380200	1383200	Like getting jiffed.
1383200	1384200	It's fact.
1384200	1385200	It's true.
1385200	1386200	Yeah.
1386200	1387200	Have you heard that?
1387200	1388200	Not only of the butt.
1388200	1389200	Oh, really?
1389200	1390200	Now you just.
1390200	1391200	Well, we got, okay.
1391200	1392200	No, no, no, no, but you're.
1393200	1397200	Has anybody here ever heard of getting Jeff being finger blasted?
1397200	1398200	No.
1398200	1399200	Right.
1399200	1402200	Well, only make noise if it's a yes.
1402200	1404200	Otherwise we assume it's a no.
1404200	1405200	Right.
1405200	1406200	Okay.
1406200	1407200	So there's a couple people.
1407200	1408200	All right.
1408200	1409200	Enough people.
1409200	1412200	Cause you know, like it seems like a great place to get, place to get Jeff to be a top
1412200	1413200	of the Ferris wheel.
1413200	1414200	Right.
1414200	1415200	All right.
1415200	1419200	When I'm learning names, whenever I'm learning someone's name, it's my, my nervous system
1419200	1421200	is going, Oh God, this person's name is so important.
1421200	1422200	So I never remember the name.
1422200	1423200	Jackson.
1423200	1424200	What's your name?
1424200	1425200	Jackson.
1425200	1426200	Jackson.
1426200	1427200	Jackson.
1427200	1428200	Let's hear it for Jackson.
1428200	1429200	All right.
1429200	1430200	Thank you.
1430200	1438200	See if you burn through them.
1438200	1441200	I want to teach him how to play bass and start a band.
1441200	1442200	That guy has great hair.
1442200	1444200	That was some good hair.
1444200	1446200	Dan is now wandering amongst the crowd.
1446200	1449200	I want to, I want to, I want to cuddle with all Australians.
1450200	1451200	They're wonderful.
1451200	1455200	They have a rare blend of jocularity and warmth.
1455200	1456200	Yeah.
1456200	1457200	Jocularity.
1457200	1459200	Piece of shit.
1459200	1460200	Fucking question.
1460200	1461200	I mean, I'm American.
1461200	1464200	I'll fucking drone strike your ass.
1464200	1465200	Wow.
1465200	1466200	Shit.
1466200	1468200	Fucking their army invented wifi.
1468200	1469200	They're so bored.
1469200	1471200	Do you know that Jeff?
1471200	1472200	Yeah.
1472200	1473200	By a woman.
1473200	1474200	Shh.
1474200	1475200	Australia is so fucked up.
1475200	1478200	Their women are inventing shit down here.
1478200	1479200	You know?
1479200	1480200	Wow.
1480200	1481200	That's been our show.
1481200	1484200	Thanks for coming, everybody.
1484200	1485200	Yeah.
1485200	1486200	No, I have to remember.
1486200	1487200	Yeah.
1487200	1492200	So yeah, in America now, the liberals, not liberals with a capital L, liberals with a
1492200	1498200	small L, are the ones who are now Constitution nuts and are probably stockpiling weapons
1498200	1500200	because there's a Nazi that got elected.
1500200	1506200	Over here, there's a, there's a, people who want to secede from the crown, those are progressives,
1507200	1510200	Jeff, and they're called labor, even though in the States, people who labor are the people
1510200	1515200	that elected Trump, but would never want to be called labor because they're so fancy.
1515200	1518200	They're just a lottery ticket away from being president.
1518200	1520200	Hey, John, is that bar open yet?
1520200	1523200	I just, I just wanted to straighten that shit out.
1523200	1525200	It's very, it's very complicated sometimes.
1525200	1526200	You don't have to yell at me.
1526200	1529200	But when in doubt, if you're having a bad show, you just go Pauline Hanson's a piece
1529200	1533200	of shit and then they all applaud.
1533200	1539200	Pauline Hanson is the Ipswich of government.
1539200	1542200	I didn't even know what an Ipswich sounds like.
1542200	1547200	Like, like when I was in high school, there was an ice cream cookie sandwich called a
1547200	1549200	chip switch.
1549200	1550200	And that's all I think.
1550200	1554200	I think of delicious ice cream and cookies.
1554200	1555200	You know what a Pauline Henson is.
1555200	1556200	It's when you take a big.
1556200	1557200	Sorry.
1557200	1558200	What was that, sir?
1558200	1561200	You're fucking wrong.
1561200	1562200	He's just wrong about everything.
1562200	1563200	No, no.
1563200	1566200	Ipswich apparently is not all about ice cream and cookies.
1566200	1568200	Wait, is it just a complete shithole?
1568200	1570200	Well, I think that he's, yeah.
1570200	1571200	What?
1571200	1573200	Sixteen and pregnant.
1573200	1574200	Sixteen and pregnant.
1574200	1579200	Well, that's very brave of you to admit that, madame.
1579200	1582200	This is the place where we can open up to each other, you guys.
1582200	1586200	Is that, is that, is that what's on the license plate frames, Ipswich?
1586200	1587200	Yeah.
1587200	1589200	Here it says don't die, drive safe, or whatever the fuck.
1589200	1590200	All right.
1590200	1591200	I want to do gender balance.
1591200	1597200	Not that we adhere to a binary cis, cisnormative fucking thing.
1597200	1600200	But I'm just saying from the other end of that spectrum.
1600200	1601200	Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan.
1601200	1602200	Don't turn around.
1602200	1603200	Don't turn around.
1603200	1604200	Dan.
1604200	1605200	Just don't stop moving.
1605200	1606200	Is there a fucking?
1606200	1607200	Just don't fucking turn around.
1607200	1610200	Just be, be, be very still.
1610200	1613200	Her visual acuity is based on movement, Dan.
1613200	1614200	Fuck it.
1614200	1618200	Just if you're going to turn around, turn around very slowly.
1618200	1619200	Jesus.
1619200	1620200	Okay.
1620200	1623200	Are you, I thought it was a Huntsman.
1623200	1624200	They're everywhere.
1624200	1625200	All right.
1625200	1628200	Are you coming up or are you just coming back from the bathroom?
1628200	1630200	No, she was going to her seat.
1630200	1631200	Oh, she's coming back from the bathroom.
1631200	1632200	Oh, okay.
1632200	1633200	All right.
1633200	1634200	She just took it.
1634200	1635200	She just took a giant shit.
1635200	1638200	She's coming back to her seat.
1638200	1639200	Did you want to come up?
1639200	1640200	Yeah.
1640200	1641200	Come on up.
1641200	1642200	All right.
1642200	1643200	Poop lady, everybody.
1643200	1644200	Hello, man.
1644200	1653200	Sorry, I couldn't quite hear that.
1653200	1654200	Your name again?
1654200	1655200	Claire.
1655200	1656200	Claire, everybody.
1656200	1657200	Welcome, Claire.
1657200	1658200	Claire.
1658200	1659200	Okay, Claire.
1659200	1663200	I'm going to confirm your Australian authenticity.
1663200	1665880	Could you read this top line and bold face for me?
1665880	1666880	Don't go in the loop for a while.
1666880	1667880	I just dropped a Pauline Hanson.
1667880	1668880	Wow.
1668880	1673880	I wrote that in the green room and then it worked perfectly.
1674880	1677880	Who would imagine the idea of taking a shit?
1677880	1680880	I didn't hear a thing, I swear.
1680880	1681880	Yeah.
1681880	1682880	Perfect timing.
1682880	1685880	There's no coincidences in the gunner, Dan.
1685880	1687880	Everything eventually leads there.
1687880	1688880	Okay, here's your question.
1688880	1693880	Oh, what we've been doing while you were pooping is we're bringing Australians up and we're
1693880	1694880	asking them questions.
1694880	1695880	She might have been doing coke.
1695880	1698880	We don't know, Dan.
1698880	1702880	I have a question I could ask.
1702880	1703880	Do you have a burning one?
1703880	1705880	Let's just say the same one.
1705880	1708880	Why is it called capsicum?
1708880	1712880	Well, I wasn't aware that bell pepper and capsicum were the same thing for such a long
1712880	1713880	time.
1713880	1714880	So I know you guys called chili pepper?
1714880	1715880	Yeah.
1715880	1716880	Chili?
1716880	1717880	Chili peppers?
1717880	1721880	So I don't know if that was always confusion for me, but no, I can't answer your question.
1721880	1722880	All right.
1722880	1723880	That's what I think.
1723880	1724880	I got one.
1724880	1725880	Can I ask one, Dan?
1725880	1726880	Maybe it's on your list.
1726880	1727880	I don't know.
1727880	1728880	Because we don't prepare anything.
1729880	1733880	I went to a place in Brisbane to get a burger, a veggie burger, and there are three cheese
1733880	1734880	options.
1734880	1740880	One was like a fancy parmesan kind of situation, and the other two were cheddar and the other
1740880	1741880	tasty.
1741880	1742880	Okay.
1742880	1743880	The fuck is that?
1743880	1747880	So I woke up and this burger shack was really good.
1747880	1752760	They're all Korean people that work behind the, like it's a Korean-run burger restaurant,
1752760	1753880	and I was like, what is tasty cheese?
1753880	1754880	She was like, that's whatever.
1754880	1756880	She was like, yeah, but what makes it so tasty?
1756880	1757880	She's like, no, it's tasty cheese.
1758880	1762880	And we just did a Celtic, not Mobius strip conversation.
1763880	1764880	Yeah.
1764880	1765880	Cody took a picture of it.
1765880	1773880	There was three cheese crackers, and the flavors were mild or low tasty, extra tasty, super
1773880	1774880	tasty.
1774880	1777880	It's like, motherfucker, give me the tastiest cracker.
1777880	1780880	Why would I want the least?
1780880	1782880	I don't got time for this shit.
1782880	1783880	I'm American.
1783880	1785880	Give me a tasty cracker.
1785880	1789880	If you got a less tasty one, give it to your family.
1789880	1791880	Don't sell it to me.
1791880	1797880	People don't know this about them, but when he's talking about crackers, he becomes Bill Cosby.
1798880	1802880	Well, you've given me the perfect opportunity to talk about how American cheese is not cheese.
1802880	1805880	I'm sure everyone here will be with me.
1805880	1806880	Thank you.
1806880	1810880	I mean, it's literally, they call it processed cheese food.
1810880	1811880	Yeah.
1811880	1813880	You caught us at our least patriotic.
1813880	1815880	Like, you could say anything you wanted.
1815880	1817880	The Statue of Liberty is a dildo.
1817880	1818880	Probably.
1819880	1824880	But basically any cheese versus American, I personally haven't tried it, but I'm sure
1824880	1827880	all of us can tell just by looking at it.
1827880	1828880	It's not cheese.
1828880	1831880	No, I mean, American cheese, like our singles.
1831880	1833880	Why is that on the table?
1833880	1838880	American cheese is like a building material.
1838880	1841880	Like, it's fucking, I think you feel, Jesus Christ.
1844880	1846880	For the listeners.
1849880	1853880	Dan threatened to show off his rippling abs.
1855880	1857880	But yeah, what do you guys call like single cheese?
1857880	1859880	I call that plastic cheese.
1859880	1861880	I don't know if I'm alone here.
1861880	1862880	We do too.
1862880	1863880	We do too.
1863880	1864880	No one likes it.
1865880	1869880	Ooh la la, the bar was low, you know?
1869880	1873880	Like, what else are you better than game shows?
1873880	1875880	Your guys' Kit Kats taste better here.
1875880	1876880	Oh, so good.
1876880	1878880	Chocolate in general from what I hear.
1878880	1880880	The chocolate here is better than American chocolate.
1880880	1881880	We have shit chocolate.
1881880	1882880	Yep.
1882880	1887880	From what I hear, it's like American, Australian, and then English as far as sugar goes.
1887880	1889880	So England is like the most sweet.
1889880	1890880	Their sweeties are pretty good.
1890880	1894880	Yeah, no, I have a British friend who says Australian chocolate just tastes off.
1894880	1895880	I can't find here.
1895880	1900880	That was my favorite in Canada, and I think England is the coffee crisp.
1900880	1901880	Have you ever had that?
1901880	1902880	No.
1902880	1903880	Ooh, it's a fucking crisp.
1903880	1904880	Yeah.
1906880	1907880	That was a coffee crisp.
1907880	1908880	Did they have them here?
1908880	1909880	Did they have them on us?
1909880	1910880	Canadian.
1910880	1911880	You're Canadian.
1911880	1912880	Those are good, right?
1912880	1914880	Yeah, it's like a giant coffee-flavored Kit Kat.
1914880	1916880	I'll fucking get you there.
1917880	1920880	You all the way there, Holmes?
1920880	1923880	You know, there's more important shit.
1923880	1926880	This show brought to you by Coffee Crisp.
1926880	1929880	Hey, wait, okay, wait.
1929880	1930880	We never asked.
1930880	1931880	I already forgot your name.
1931880	1932880	Claire.
1932880	1933880	Claire.
1933880	1934880	Claire.
1934880	1936880	Ms. Jackson, if you're nasty.
1936880	1939880	What's his name from Die Hard?
1939880	1940880	All right.
1940880	1942880	Wait, did we ever ask her a question?
1942880	1944880	Oh, here's a question.
1944880	1945880	Where are the homeless people?
1946880	1947880	Where are they?
1947880	1948880	Okay, I don't know.
1948880	1952880	I can't speak for Brisbane, but in Melbourne, once it hits night, you'll see them.
1952880	1953880	Oh, okay.
1953880	1954880	Everywhere.
1954880	1955880	They come out at night.
1955880	1956880	Yes.
1956880	1957880	So they have homes, maybe.
1957880	1958880	Do they have homes?
1958880	1960880	I'm not from Melbourne, personally, so I can't really say.
1960880	1963880	I'm usually here at night, so.
1963880	1965880	Oh, shit.
1965880	1968880	Oh, it's turning Brisbane in here.
1968880	1970880	It's getting Brisbane-y.
1971880	1972880	All right.
1972880	1974880	Well, then let's have a hand for Claire, and we're going to...
1974880	1975880	Claire, everybody.
1976880	1977880	Thank you very much.
1987880	1989880	I'm going to go get another Aussie.
1989880	1990880	It's good.
1990880	1991880	It's been good, right?
1991880	1992880	No, no.
1992880	1993880	It's fun.
1993880	1994880	You're a fisher of people.
1994880	1995880	Oh.
1995880	1996880	Like Jesus.
1996880	1997880	Yeah.
1997880	1998880	He made the angels.
1998880	1999880	All right.
1999880	2000880	I'm going to go way in the back.
2000880	2001880	But also, there's the Holy Ghost.
2001880	2003880	The ghosts are involved there.
2003880	2005880	If God can be a ghost, then the angels are probably...
2005880	2006880	All right.
2006880	2007880	That's Jesus's ghost.
2007880	2008880	Yeah.
2008880	2009880	Because he died.
2009880	2010880	Right.
2010880	2011880	I don't know if that's true.
2011880	2012880	That's not true.
2012880	2013880	Well, I cannot...
2013880	2014880	Prove it.
2014880	2015880	Do you have any bishops in the house?
2015880	2018880	I got my eye on this guy.
2018880	2019880	What's your name, sir?
2019880	2020880	Owen.
2020880	2021880	Owen.
2021880	2022880	All right.
2022880	2023880	Owen, come on up.
2023880	2024880	Owen.
2025880	2027880	Making his way to the stage in leaps and bounds.
2029880	2030880	All right.
2031880	2032880	Okay.
2032880	2033880	We have to start a band with these guys.
2033880	2034880	Look at these fuckers.
2034880	2035880	Everybody looks cool.
2035880	2036880	Hello, Owen.
2037880	2038880	How's it going?
2038880	2039880	How's it going?
2039880	2040880	Like your pants.
2040880	2041880	I like those pants a lot.
2041880	2042880	All right.
2042880	2044880	I didn't even play music because I was too dazzled by his trousers.
2044880	2045880	Those are exciting.
2045880	2047880	Am I playing this microphone?
2047880	2048880	Yeah, yeah.
2048880	2049880	Yeah.
2049880	2050880	Use that mic.
2050880	2051880	Okay.
2051880	2052880	Pretty hot.
2052880	2053880	Try this top one to see if you're Australian.
2053880	2054880	Which one's this one?
2054880	2056880	The top one in boldface.
2056880	2057880	How's the serenity?
2061880	2062880	So much serenity.
2063880	2064880	All right.
2064880	2065880	Well, try the other one.
2065880	2066880	Try the top.
2067880	2068880	Yank train.
2068880	2070880	I put a boogie dolla down.
2070880	2072880	I kind of made that one up.
2072880	2073880	Okay.
2073880	2074880	We made that one up.
2074880	2075880	Okay.
2075880	2076880	All right.
2076880	2077880	Try this top one.
2077880	2078880	Try the one on top.
2078880	2079880	No, no.
2079880	2080880	I can't be doing that one.
2080880	2081880	Oh, really?
2081880	2085880	A little girl will tell me my dick looks like a bermerang because it's flat wooden and bent.
2085880	2086880	Yeah.
2086880	2087880	Okay.
2087880	2088880	I don't think you're Australian.
2088880	2091880	Well, both my parents are Irish, but I've lived here all my life.
2091880	2092880	Oh, okay.
2092880	2094880	I'm picking up for broad matters.
2094880	2095880	Yeah.
2096880	2097880	This way.
2097880	2098880	All right.
2098880	2100880	That's why you're wearing chart and have green hair.
2100880	2101880	You really are Irish.
2101880	2102880	A different take.
2102880	2103880	Okay.
2103880	2106880	So here's our question for you.
2106880	2107880	Forgot your name.
2107880	2108880	Owen.
2108880	2109880	Owen.
2109880	2111880	You're three for three then.
2111880	2112880	That's fine.
2112880	2113880	Okay.
2113880	2114880	Owen.
2115880	2118880	Is it isolation you endure for control?
2118880	2122880	Or is it that once you gain control, you crave isolation?
2127880	2129880	What does that even mean?
2129880	2130880	Yeah.
2130880	2132880	It means I'm about to get a podcasty.
2132880	2134880	Oh, shit.
2135880	2136880	All right.
2136880	2137880	Maybe that's a...
2137880	2138880	Wait.
2138880	2139880	I can't be done with this question.
2139880	2140880	Yeah.
2140880	2142880	I'll save that question for someone else.
2142880	2143880	All right.
2143880	2144880	Let's see.
2144880	2145880	Have you tried...
2145880	2149880	Have you played Mario Run yet?
2149880	2150880	Mario Run?
2150880	2151880	It's on the iPhone?
2151880	2152880	Okay.
2153880	2154880	A lot of people.
2154880	2155880	Don't feel bad.
2155880	2156880	All right.
2156880	2157880	All right.
2157880	2158880	Okay.
2158880	2159880	Owen.
2159880	2161880	What are Utes and why are they scandalous?
2161880	2166880	Because I suppose a lot of people fuck at the back of them like in the country towns and
2166880	2167880	stuff.
2167880	2168880	So what's a Ute?
2168880	2169880	What is a Ute?
2169880	2170880	It's like a truck.
2170880	2171880	It's a truck.
2171880	2172880	That's what the deal is.
2172880	2173880	It's a pickup truck.
2173880	2174880	Okay.
2174880	2175880	Like a lorry.
2175880	2176880	A pickup truck.
2176880	2177880	We call them lorries.
2177880	2179880	It's a lot of crazy people try Utes.
2179880	2182880	It's for like tradies and stuff, I suppose.
2182880	2186880	What are the pickup trucks that have like weird cages in the back?
2186880	2189880	Is it everybody just like captured a crocodile?
2189880	2190880	What are those?
2190880	2193880	You know what I'm talking about?
2193880	2194880	For the homeless?
2194880	2195880	All right.
2195880	2196880	Okay.
2196880	2197880	We got that sorted.
2197880	2202880	I think someone said Dippy bag, which really answers the question.
2202880	2206880	It's just ‑‑ it's really ‑‑ it's happening again.
2206880	2207880	No, I know.
2207880	2208880	It's ‑‑ yeah.
2208880	2210880	I mean it's ‑‑ they're trying to help.
2210880	2211880	It's our fault.
2211880	2212880	It's our fault.
2212880	2213880	We're too liberal.
2213880	2214880	We're clueless.
2214880	2215880	We're lowercase L.
2215880	2217880	Someone either yelled haggis or faggots.
2217880	2218880	I don't know where that one was.
2218880	2222880	Well, we can't drag Owen up here and expect him to be a Ute expert.
2222880	2224880	You're asking the wrong person.
2224880	2226880	I'm not a type of person that drives a Ute.
2226880	2227880	Right.
2227880	2230880	Do you have any other Australian questions?
2230880	2231880	Okay.
2231880	2232880	Yes.
2232880	2233880	No.
2233880	2235880	I have a question.
2235880	2238880	Owen, what do you do here in Brisbane?
2238880	2239880	Sorry, Melbourne.
2239880	2242880	A fucking ‑‑ go back to Ipswich, Mike.
2242880	2247880	I just wanted to see if you guys were listening, man.
2247880	2248880	What do you do here in Melbourne?
2248880	2251880	I roll burritos at a place called Fonda.
2251880	2252880	Nice.
2252880	2253880	Yeah, man.
2253880	2254880	Yeah.
2254880	2255880	On Chapel Street.
2255880	2256880	Yeah?
2256880	2257880	Yeah, yeah.
2257880	2259880	What's the secret to a properly rolled burrito?
2259880	2260880	Just love, man.
2260880	2261880	Just keep rolling.
2261880	2262880	I love it, man.
2262880	2266680	That's why my burritos ‑‑ No, see, we're from Southern California.
2266680	2270280	When I travel to places that aren't Southern California, I don't really go for Mexican
2270280	2274600	food because I get so much at home, but there's a lot of Mexican joints around here.
2274600	2279000	What you really want is like an Australian Irish steward rolling a burrito.
2279000	2280000	You really do.
2280000	2281000	With love.
2281000	2282000	Yeah, yeah.
2282000	2283000	Is the Mexican food good here?
2283000	2284000	No, no, no.
2284000	2285000	It's terrible.
2285000	2295640	I was in London for a couple weeks, and there was all these Mexican places, and I'm like,
2295640	2298280	I'm not going to get guacamole from London avocados.
2298280	2303760	I don't think I coincidentally ate at the only good restaurant in Melbourne.
2303760	2307440	There must be great restaurants here because I had the best Italian dinner in my life tonight
2307440	2308440	before the show.
2308440	2309440	Oh, so good.
2309440	2310440	Oh, they're round.
2310440	2311440	Yeah.
2311440	2312960	But there's a lot of Italian people here, and they kind of grew this country.
2313400	2316760	There wasn't a lot of Mexican dudes that came down and said, yeah, I want to build a restaurant
2316760	2317760	here.
2317760	2318760	Right.
2318760	2324680	Like, my bosses are like Australian dudes that spent two weeks in Mexico, so it's just
2324680	2328080	like, you can't spend two weeks and know how to make food.
2328080	2330840	This is ridiculous, man.
2330840	2332720	Are they Australian or Irish?
2332720	2333720	They're Australian dudes.
2333720	2334720	Yeah, yeah.
2334720	2335720	So they just kind of backpacked down there.
2335720	2336720	Yeah, yeah.
2336720	2337720	They're not even chefs.
2337720	2338720	One was a fire fire.
2338720	2342720	The other one wanted to be like a lawyer, and it doesn't make any sense.
2343480	2344480	Is that the logo?
2344480	2345480	A firefighter and a lawyer?
2345480	2349080	There's a pen and a hose crossing each other.
2349080	2352480	And one guy said to the other, I like these burritos.
2352480	2354480	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2354480	2356480	I like that burrito, Mike.
2356480	2358480	I don't know.
2358480	2359480	It's confusing.
2359480	2360480	The burritos are great.
2360480	2362960	Yeah, but you can't just go down and get high in Mexico for two weeks and come back and
2362960	2364760	think that you know how to make a goddamn burrito.
2364760	2365760	That's really...
2365760	2370360	The first burrito they opened up was a kangaroo burrito, and it failed miserably because it
2370360	2371360	just doesn't work.
2371360	2372360	It's terrible.
2373000	2374000	Oh, man.
2374000	2375000	Yeah, man.
2375000	2376000	They're scary, right?
2376000	2377000	Yeah, they're terrifying.
2377000	2378000	They have human arms.
2378000	2379000	Yeah, yeah.
2379000	2380000	Okay.
2380000	2381000	All right.
2381000	2382000	And if they bite you...
2382000	2383000	No, you guys are just like crazy or something.
2383000	2384000	They try and kill your dog.
2384000	2385000	And if they bite you, you become one, right?
2385000	2386000	Yeah, yeah.
2386000	2389800	And you'd have to kill the head of the bloodline even to gain your freedom.
2389800	2393840	Yeah, like if a kangaroo walked up to you, you're not going to go, oh, adorable.
2393840	2394840	You're going to go like...
2394840	2396680	You're going to put your fucking fists up, right?
2396680	2397680	Like you have to do.
2397680	2398680	And that plays right into their game, right?
2398680	2402240	When they pull out a mob of kangaroos, it's not a fun time, you know?
2403240	2404240	It's a mob of kangaroos.
2404240	2405240	They travel in packs?
2405240	2406240	Yeah, they travel in mobs.
2406240	2408240	It's like a murder of crows.
2408240	2409240	Yeah, yeah.
2409240	2412240	Just like across the streets of Melbourne at night?
2412240	2414240	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2414240	2415240	All right.
2415240	2418240	Well, and that's where the homeless people go.
2418240	2419240	Exactly.
2419240	2420240	They get into a fucking one-on-one fight.
2420240	2421240	They morph into kangaroos.
2421240	2423240	Well, I don't know what's going on there.
2423240	2427240	Yeah, I thought maybe there was like a Highlander thing happening.
2427240	2428240	All right.
2428240	2430400	Well, let's have a hand for...
2430400	2431400	Already forgot.
2431400	2432400	Always.
2432400	2433400	Everybody.
2433400	2435400	Thank you, brother.
2439400	2441400	They're good people.
2441400	2442400	They're polite.
2442400	2444400	They're warm.
2444400	2445400	They're jocular.
2445400	2446400	You fucking dick.
2446400	2447400	I said it.
2447400	2449400	It's a good word.
2449400	2451400	Jolly, silly.
2451400	2452400	They're energetic.
2452400	2453400	They're not, you know...
2453400	2454400	They're amicable.
2454400	2456400	They're gregarious.
2456400	2458400	They're karangabagi.
2458400	2460400	That guy just keeps yelling weird-ass shit up there.
2461400	2463400	I think he said bangarang.
2463400	2465400	But also it's okay if you live in a bangarang.
2465400	2466400	What's bangarang?
2466400	2468400	Some bullshit.
2468400	2469400	It's from Hook.
2469400	2470400	It's a line from Hook.
2470400	2478400	It's what the kids say when they jump around and ruin the pre-ruined myth of Peter Pan.
2478400	2483400	Why is it every eight years rich people in Hollywood think that poor people want to indulge
2483400	2485400	their fucking youth obsession with this...
2485400	2488400	Who the fuck cares about Peter Pan?
2488400	2490400	Rich people love Peter Pan.
2490400	2493400	Every eight years some director's like, I love Peter Pan.
2493400	2496400	Yeah, because you're fucking weirdo.
2496400	2499400	You were raised in a vat underneath Malibu.
2501400	2503400	Peter Pan is lame.
2503400	2505400	Sorry, I didn't know Peter Pan was here.
2505400	2511400	For me, the only interesting thing about Peter Pan was Wendy in that little night dress.
2511400	2512400	That was always...
2512400	2513400	I was fucking...
2513400	2515400	I mean, the dog was...
2515400	2517400	I was 6'2", motherfucker.
2518400	2521400	I didn't start watching when I was 28.
2521400	2524400	Oh, I'd like to get some of that Wendy.
2524400	2530400	But you know what, you ever see a...
2530400	2532400	A grown man naked?
2532400	2534400	No, like a lady dressed as Peter Pan.
2534400	2536400	That's pretty hot.
2536400	2538400	Yeah, because I have a short hair fetish.
2538400	2542400	When girls dress like elves, I'm pretty into it.
2542400	2545400	There was a girl one time that worked at this bar in our neighborhood,
2545400	2548400	and she dressed as David Bowie from Man of Hell to Earth,
2548400	2552400	with the short red hair and kind of the Aladdin-sane kind of Bowie.
2552400	2555400	Like a Paul Henson kind of...
2555400	2556400	Look.
2556400	2558400	Do you see a picture of her?
2558400	2561400	Pauline Henson kind of looks like the Man of Hell to Earth, like a little bit.
2561400	2562400	Really?
2562400	2563400	Do you see a picture?
2563400	2565400	Do you get like different color eyes and shit like that?
2565400	2569400	They showed me a picture after I talked about her for 40 minutes last night.
2569400	2570400	There she is.
2570400	2572400	I was like, oh, she looks like a...
2572400	2578400	Did you go home and have some private night thoughts about Pauline Henson that night?
2578400	2583400	You know, judge not lest ye be judged, Melvin.
2583400	2586400	Did you give her the old banger ring?
2586400	2590400	I jeffed her.
2590400	2592400	Let's hold Jeff, Pauline, and Henson tonight, shall we?
2592400	2597400	If you do nothing else tonight, try to Jeff, Pauline, and Henson.
2597400	2599400	With all your heart, that's the only way we'll win.
2599400	2601400	We're not going to win with shame and hate.
2601400	2603400	Can't wait for them to become honest.
2603400	2605400	Just Jeff.
2605400	2606400	Jeff the...
2606400	2608400	The liberals.
2608400	2611400	That's so weird calling them liberals.
2611400	2613400	All right.
2613400	2614400	So...
2614400	2616400	Well, I don't know if this is interesting, but...
2616400	2618400	Well, then by all means, lay it out.
2618400	2620400	I only paid $1,000 for a ticket.
2620400	2621400	You know what?
2621400	2622400	Fuck you.
2622400	2624400	I flew here.
2624400	2625400	It was expensive.
2625400	2626400	Well, yeah, because it was first class.
2626400	2627400	Well, you know what?
2627400	2628400	Keep pulling threads, man.
2628400	2629400	Maybe I won't come back.
2629400	2630400	Fine with me.
2630400	2633400	Fine with you.
2633400	2635400	This is actually how Dan thinks.
2635400	2636400	He just...
2636400	2637400	He told...
2637400	2638400	It's the way they invented the boomerang.
2638400	2642400	They were very passive aggressive people.
2642400	2643400	Did you just throw something at me?
2643400	2647400	No.
2647400	2656400	If I did, why would I still have it?
2656400	2657400	Yeah.
2657400	2662400	Well, I meant because it was passed over, and then it was coming back around to the...
2662400	2663400	Hit him in the back of the head.
2663400	2664400	Yeah, but mine was funnier.
2664400	2665400	I know.
2665400	2672400	Well...
2672400	2677400	So we were on the airplane coming out, and Cody, my girlfriend, she...
2677400	2685400	Her device, the screen thing, got stuck on the setting for blind people,
2685400	2688400	where it describes in audio everything that's happening on screen.
2688400	2689400	Oh, yeah.
2689400	2691400	The video screen for the film was on the flight.
2691400	2694400	And they really lean into it.
2694400	2699400	You know how all the movies begin with logos?
2699400	2701400	Title cards and things.
2701400	2703400	The person that...
2703400	2707400	The read that describes the movie for the blind describes the logos,
2707400	2711400	and I wrote three of them down, and it just wanted...
2711400	2712400	It was amazing.
2712400	2713400	So here...
2713400	2714400	Yeah.
2714400	2716400	And then the guy goes...
2716400	2721400	Searchlights sweep an evening sky, piercing clouds, and illuminating a towering edifice
2721400	2724400	in the form of 20th Century Fox.
2724400	2729400	With the lights of Hollywood, palm trees, and the hills beyond.
2729400	2731400	He says that.
2731400	2733400	To me, it feels like...
2733400	2735400	I'm sure we have blind listeners.
2735400	2736400	I would hope we do.
2736400	2741400	I would hope that maybe we could be a part of a visually impaired person's enjoyment of life.
2741400	2742400	Absolutely.
2743400	2746400	And so I guess I confess to that person,
2746400	2750400	and it would be fun to talk to a visually impaired person about this stuff, but...
2750400	2753400	Do we have anybody tonight by any chance?
2755400	2757400	Don't jump!
2759400	2761400	Are you visually impaired up there?
2761400	2762400	Yeah.
2762400	2763400	Yeah?
2763400	2764400	Like...
2765400	2766400	You're not blind yet.
2766400	2768400	You're going blind.
2769400	2770400	Jesus, hey!
2771400	2772400	Jesus.
2772400	2774400	This guy's not fucking convinced, baby.
2781400	2782400	About 10 years.
2782400	2783400	You shut it.
2783400	2785400	Are you going blind, too?
2785400	2787400	Yeah, I feel like I'm going to go to the toilet.
2788400	2789400	It doesn't matter.
2789400	2791400	I think we've gotten off of the track here.
2791400	2793400	I was just...
2794400	2796400	I was just reading these descriptions of it.
2796400	2797400	This guy's just going blind drunk.
2797400	2799400	She's actually got a fucking condition.
2799400	2801400	We're all going to be blind in 10 years, sir.
2801400	2802400	Like, basically.
2802400	2803400	My eyes are going.
2803400	2804400	I mean...
2804400	2805400	Anyways.
2805400	2806400	All right.
2806400	2807400	That didn't land either.
2807400	2808400	What's your name up there, Miss?
2808400	2809400	Alice.
2809400	2810400	Alice.
2811400	2814400	How long do you think you have until you're completely blind?
2817400	2818400	Say what?
2819400	2820400	Five, ten.
2820400	2821400	Five, ten years?
2821400	2823400	So what percentage vision do you currently have?
2824400	2825400	Seven.
2825400	2826400	Seven.
2826400	2827400	You...
2828400	2829400	Fucking...
2829400	2830400	Kind of fucking...
2830400	2831400	Jeff, you so hard, man.
2832400	2834400	Jackson Stow, right in the ass.
2834400	2836400	The world's worst life coach.
2836400	2837400	Yeah.
2837400	2838400	Listen, we're going to go to the show.
2838400	2839400	But you're going blind.
2839400	2840400	Why don't you stay in the balcony?
2840400	2842400	I'm going to use the good ticket.
2842400	2845400	And if you need any help or advice, I'll just yell back at you.
2845400	2846400	Yeah.
2847400	2848400	Okay.
2848400	2850400	And that'll be $500.
2851400	2852400	But...
2852400	2853400	Well, look.
2853400	2854400	I mean, I don't...
2854400	2855400	Well, you can...
2855400	2856400	I'm going to ask you a yes or no question.
2856400	2857400	It was at Alice.
2857400	2859400	And you can just yell down.
2860400	2867400	Is it, to me, when I hear somebody describing something for the blind in this intense, like,
2867400	2871400	rapturous voice, to me, that seems almost mocking.
2871400	2877400	Like, you wouldn't believe what you're seeing, what I'm seeing, and you can't see.
2877400	2879400	Like, oh, my God, it's crazy.
2879400	2882400	The lights are alive over the 20th century.
2882400	2884400	Fox, look, doesn't that seem...
2885400	2886400	Is that offensive?
2887400	2888400	Yeah, probably.
2888400	2889400	Okay.
2889400	2891400	Yeah, that's as close as we're going to get.
2891400	2893400	She's not blind yet.
2893400	2896400	She's, like me, not blind and has my answer.
2896400	2897400	Probably.
2897400	2902400	We really need a blind person down here immediately if you're listening.
2902400	2903400	Make some calls.
2903400	2904400	But anyways...
2906400	2908400	And then, so here's two more.
2908400	2911400	I rewinded it a thousand times and...
2912400	2915400	Dan and Cody were laughing so hard.
2915400	2919400	It's the middle of the night flying across the ocean, and they're just giggling so loud.
2919400	2921400	Like, what are you guys watching?
2921400	2924400	It's so completely descriptive, and the guy is really into it.
2924400	2929400	Imagine ever having to describe those fucking title cards.
2929400	2935400	The second one was, a bearded bronze figure, like a classical warrior, shoots an arrow,
2935400	2939400	which flies through the holes in a row of axe blades.
2939400	2941400	TSG Entertainment.
2943400	2949400	Like, if you could have that guy pitch back their logo to them while they were designing,
2949400	2951400	that does sound stupid.
2951400	2953400	Yeah, it sounds a little busy.
2953400	2957400	Why is he shooting an arrow through a row of axe blades?
2957400	2959400	That's exactly what happens.
2959400	2963400	I would like to see, like, TriStar Pegasus is flying at you.
2963400	2967400	An ordinary horse gallops across the horizon.
2967400	2969400	Uh-oh, it's got wings now.
2969400	2973400	It's quickly sprouting wings. It reveals a Pegasusian nature.
2973400	2975400	It soars over the viewer.
2975400	2981400	A giant boy ruins the three-dimensionality of a crescent moon by sitting on it and fishing.
2982400	2988400	You wonder if the moon is up his ass crack as he waits patiently for a fish that may never exist.
2988400	2991400	That can't be comfortable.
2992400	2995400	And then this is the last one.
2995400	3003400	This one really, like, light gleams off a metal letter C, which hangs from a chain,
3003400	3007400	casting shadows on cinder-black walls on either side of it.
3007400	3012400	Two rectangles cut from the C make the right-hand shadow look like an E.
3012400	3014400	Sharon in Entertainment.
3014400	3019400	No, I was watching that one before I was shooting the audio, and that visual didn't even scan.
3019400	3022400	Yeah, no, and then someone has to scan it and then send it back.
3022400	3025400	Yeah, that's a shame on you, Sharon in Entertainment.
3025400	3028400	Just make it like a tree that gets hit by lightning.
3028400	3031400	Or like a Star War or something.
3031400	3036400	A little robot is dancing around, and then he's a bad robot.
3036400	3039400	You know, some people do it right.
3039400	3044400	A lion who's had a long day is forced to roar like he's an actual lion.
3044400	3047400	He's kind of phoning it in.
3048400	3050400	MGM.
3055400	3057400	You're a sound effect describer?
3057400	3060400	Wait, sorry, I need to hear this. What did you say?
3064400	3067400	Are you a person that does this for a living?
3067400	3068400	You are a describer?
3068400	3070400	And you've been sitting there quietly.
3070400	3073400	Well, this fucking lunatic over here is like,
3074400	3076400	so this is what you do.
3076400	3079400	Well, would you come up and talk to us?
3079400	3081400	No.
3081400	3083400	Describer.
3084400	3089400	It's not part of my craft to be the center of the spotlight visually.
3090400	3092400	I know I can't do your accent.
3092400	3094400	That's the whole point.
3094400	3096400	What's your name, Miss?
3096400	3097400	Sensara.
3097400	3100400	Fantastic. Welcome, Sensara, to the stage.
3103400	3113400	You can take this microphone.
3113400	3117400	Sensara, you're like a thundercat.
3117400	3119400	No, that's Chitara, Dan.
3119400	3121400	Why would Sensara be a thundercat?
3121400	3122400	There's no cat in the name.
3122400	3126400	You just heard the ara part and connected the dumbest dot.
3126400	3128400	It's more like the Wheel of Fortune.
3128400	3130400	I'm sorry, I was rude.
3131400	3134400	So you do describing live theater.
3134400	3135400	Yes, I do live theater.
3135400	3137400	Does that mean you're sitting next to somebody who's visually impaired
3137400	3139400	and you're kind of whispering their ear or what?
3139400	3142400	No, no, we get put in a booth in back and they get little headsets.
3142400	3145400	So one ear they hear us and the other ear they're watching.
3145400	3148400	And so you have to just freestyle and watch what's happening
3148400	3150400	and then describe that for them.
3150400	3151400	Oh, really?
3151400	3153400	We actually usually see the show three times.
3153400	3155400	Oh, so you're quite well rehearsed then?
3155400	3156400	Yes.
3156400	3158400	Is it scripted out or are you just kind of rolling with it?
3158400	3161400	No, we just take some notes and then sort of go from there.
3161400	3162400	That's fun.
3162400	3164400	But you would be better than I would at describing me
3164400	3166400	if I were to pantomime a scene.
3166400	3168400	You could probably describe it pretty well.
3168400	3170400	Not to put you on the spot.
3170400	3174400	Everybody, everybody close your eyes.
3174400	3176400	That guy, close your mouth.
3176400	3178400	Everyone else, close your eyes.
3178400	3179400	All right, wait.
3179400	3181400	I want to, yeah, I'm trying to figure out because it's pantomime.
3181400	3183400	That wouldn't make sense.
3183400	3184400	Wait, let me.
3184400	3185400	Don't yell stuff out.
3185400	3187400	You're a terrible person.
3187400	3189400	We're having a good show, sir.
3189400	3191400	You can't, you will not ruin this.
3191400	3194400	It's only, it's only, holy shit, how much more time do we have?
3194400	3195400	Go ahead.
3195400	3197400	Three more hours.
3197400	3198400	All right, okay.
3198400	3199400	About a standard opera.
3199400	3204400	All right, so let's just try, I'm going to try to do something physical.
3204400	3205400	I guess it'll be like mining.
3205400	3207400	Okay, and let me just describe it.
3207400	3209400	So there's a middle-aged man with gray hair and a beard
3209400	3214400	and a gray t-shirt, a bit dirty, and creased khaki pants.
3214400	3223400	Thank you.
3223400	3227400	I feel violated.
3227400	3229400	I feel Xeroxed.
3229400	3231400	I didn't talk about issues.
3231400	3232400	I feel faxed.
3232400	3233400	I feel like you faxed me.
3233400	3234400	I was reduced.
3234400	3236400	All right, that's great.
3236400	3238400	Go ahead, and then.
3238400	3241400	So he raises his left leg as if to step.
3241400	3245400	He grabs the foot, he pretends to take off his shoe
3245400	3247400	and holds it in front of him.
3247400	3250400	He now pushes the shoe as if it had buttons.
3250400	3255400	He holds the shoe to his ear and pretends to talk.
3255400	3256400	You can talk, too.
3256400	3258400	She just describes the action.
3258400	3264400	Hey, Kevin, it's been seven years since you've spoken to me on my shoe.
3264400	3268400	He looks angry.
3268400	3269400	He breathes heavily.
3269400	3270400	I'll get it.
3270400	3272400	Split screen.
3272400	3275400	Honey, I'm sorry, you're on the phone.
3275400	3279400	Oh, never mind the split screen.
3279400	3281400	If you're on the phone, I can go back into the kitchen.
3281400	3282400	To the right?
3282400	3289400	There's a man in a dark suit.
3289400	3297400	That's all you fucking need.
3297400	3302400	Didn't mention my age, my graying hair or anything.
3302400	3304400	Are you guys like referees?
3304400	3307400	Can we sue you and stuff?
3307400	3311400	You know, we're classists.
3311400	3315400	Honey, listen, I need to speak with you.
3315400	3317400	Please come back.
3317400	3320400	The man in the suit walks towards him.
3320400	3322400	They stare at each other.
3322400	3328400	He pulls out a gun and points it at the man in the t-shirt.
3328400	3332400	Honey, I'm leaving you.
3332400	3337400	The man in the t-shirt holds out his hands imploringly.
3337400	3338400	He points.
3338400	3340400	He throws something.
3340400	3344400	The shoe.
3344400	3346400	The shoe hits the man in the suit.
3346400	3348400	He falls to the ground.
3348400	3350400	The older man runs up and grabs the gun.
3350400	3351400	They wrestle.
3351400	3352400	It points at the audience.
3352400	3357400	It moves to the left, points to the right, points to the left again.
3357400	3358400	They grapple.
3358400	3362400	They do the hokey pokey.
3362400	3364400	They start doing a Charleston.
3364400	3368400	They're now smiling.
3368400	3374400	The man in the t-shirt pretends to open up his chest.
3374400	3378400	And a snake comes out.
3378400	3386400	The man in the suit licks his fingers and jumps the man in the t-shirt.
3386400	3387400	Did she say Jeff?
3387400	3388400	She said Jeff.
3388400	3389400	All right.
3389400	3390400	Well, that's...
3390400	3391400	Sansara.
3391400	3392400	Sansara.
3392400	3393400	The lovely Sansara.
3393400	3394400	Sansara.
3394400	3396400	Thank you so much.
3396400	3397400	Thank you.
3397400	3398400	Thank you.
3398400	3401400	That was wonderful.
3401400	3402400	That was so pro.
3402400	3405400	That was absolutely great.
3405400	3406400	Shit.
3406400	3407400	Now, how do we top Sansara?
3407400	3408400	Sansara.
3408400	3409400	Sansara.
3409400	3412400	That was good.
3412400	3414400	She knows what...
3414400	3417400	She gathers information and she knows what Jeffing is now.
3417400	3421400	I don't want to jinx it, but we're having the best show we've ever had in our lives.
3421400	3423400	It's fucking like...
3423400	3428400	I don't want to make it a bad show by saying that.
3428400	3429400	There's a thousand people.
3429400	3432400	They're from a different continent and we're fucking nailing it.
3432400	3434400	What time do we start?
3434400	3435400	How much time do we have to...
3435400	3436400	We have about an hour.
3436400	3437400	Fuck.
3437400	3438400	Fuck.
3438400	3439400	All right.
3439400	3440400	All right.
3440400	3441400	We met with...
3441400	3442400	We don't have...
3442400	3443400	We could end it right now if we wanted.
3443400	3444400	No, no.
3444400	3445400	For God's sakes.
3445400	3446400	No.
3446400	3447400	It would hurt my feelings if you said yes.
3447400	3448400	Thank you.
3448400	3449400	Thank you for...
3449400	3450400	Even though you were thinking yes, now would be a good time to end the show.
3450400	3451400	It should be an hour long.
3451400	3452400	You don't have an act.
3452400	3453400	You're a podcaster.
3453400	3455400	But I'm glad you...
3455400	3461400	Let's just suffer because the next chapter is the atonement with the father, but that's
3461400	3463400	heteronormative.
3463400	3464400	It's like the...
3464400	3467200	On Campbell's Story Circle, we're in the middle of the show.
3467200	3471720	We just met with the goddess, Sansara, not to put too fine a point on it.
3471720	3472720	Right.
3472720	3475360	Now we have to pay the price.
3475360	3477960	She literally described what it was we were doing.
3477960	3479960	We can't keep reacting now.
3479960	3480960	We have to...
3480960	3481960	We're moving forward.
3481960	3482960	We now have to have volition.
3482960	3485520	We have to decide we want to accomplish something and that's when we're going to get our asses
3485520	3486520	fixed.
3486520	3487520	You know, you and I have talked about a couple times doing...
3487520	3488520	Maybe this is a bad pitch.
3488520	3491120	And I don't know, Spencer, you're probably not prepared for this.
3491120	3492120	No, never.
3493120	3495880	But, like, Dan and I, we're not allowed to.
3495880	3496880	We can't do it anymore.
3496880	3497880	No, let's do it.
3497880	3498880	I decided on the green one.
3498880	3499880	Let's do it.
3499880	3500880	If it wasn't we were talking about...
3500880	3501880	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3501880	3505240	As long as it's not medieval fantasy, I think we could do it.
3505240	3509200	Because we were talking about bringing back a little bit of role playing back into the
3509200	3510200	show.
3510200	3514200	I'll take the heat on this one.
3514200	3515200	Yeah.
3515200	3519600	But, yeah, I mean, there's concern because Harmon Quest and Are We Stepping on Toes
3519600	3520600	isn't, like, you know, but nah.
3520600	3521600	I'm sorry.
3521600	3522600	We'll take...
3522600	3523600	We'll take...
3523600	3524600	I'll take...
3524600	3525600	I'll take...
3525600	3526600	It'll be, like, a promotion.
3526600	3527600	Yeah, yeah, exactly.
3527600	3530480	This is, like, a big commercial for Harmon Quest on CISO, which you probably can't even
3530480	3532880	watch here because your country doesn't have it.
3532880	3536960	Spencer, I don't reckon you have any dice on you, probably.
3536960	3537960	What?
3537960	3538960	Dice.
3538960	3539960	Oh, that's fine.
3539960	3540960	Someone said they have dice.
3540960	3541960	I'm sure.
3541960	3542960	You got multi-sided dice?
3542960	3543960	You got it!
3543960	3546960	Actually, half of our crowd has dice on the right hand.
3547320	3553600	You're not going to gather a thousand Australian-Hermanians and not have at least nine dice.
3553600	3556640	Why don't we have him...
3556640	3557640	Well...
3557640	3562200	This guy's got a full-on sack of dice.
3562200	3567160	It's Eric Wareheim from Tim and Eric, who's a very handsome person.
3567160	3568800	Make sure to get these back.
3568800	3569800	What's your name, sir?
3569800	3570800	Bodhi?
3570800	3571800	Bodhi.
3571800	3572800	All right.
3572800	3573800	That's rugged.
3573800	3576920	Well, Bodhi, do you want to stay and play with us since it's your dice?
3576920	3577920	All right.
3577920	3578920	Yeah.
3578920	3588080	And then let's use giggly pink hair, who was like, don't call on me.
3588080	3590160	I don't want to sit next to the...
3590160	3591720	Do you want to come up?
3591720	3592720	You don't have to come up.
3592720	3594680	I can't hear what you're saying.
3594680	3595680	Blue hair.
3595680	3596680	Blue hair.
3596680	3599360	I don't see through that lens.
3599360	3602680	You could have been anything.
3602680	3603680	What's your name?
3603680	3604680	Jenna.
3604680	3605680	Jenna.
3605680	3606680	Okay, Jenna, everybody.
3607440	3610920	You know what, damn, hello, Jenna.
3610920	3615520	It occurs to me that for our listeners, because we're not live streaming, we should just have
3615520	3620640	a sensara at all times, just describing the visual bits.
3620640	3621640	Oh, yeah.
3621640	3622640	Yeah, that's a good idea.
3622640	3626760	And then we cannot pay her for her services that she gets paid for.
3626760	3632240	It's a soft spot with Spencer.
3632240	3634240	He's been officially an audience guest.
3634240	3635240	No!
3635360	3637360	Three and a half years.
3637360	3641040	It's just, you know, I don't know, that just seems like literally her job.
3641040	3645680	No, yeah, I mean, it's like, yeah, I noticed she didn't like bound up here.
3645680	3648880	She was like, she kind of sat there and was like, we made her come up.
3648880	3651440	She's like, yeah, fucking, I do this at parties, too.
3651440	3653440	It's worth money.
3653440	3657440	Jenna, that's why I got the bling.
3657440	3659440	Jenna, are you a local?
3659440	3660440	Ish.
3660440	3661440	Ish?
3661440	3662440	Where are you from?
3662440	3663440	I'm originally from Maui.
3663440	3664440	Oh, grab that microphone.
3665440	3666440	Yeah.
3667440	3668440	Yeah.
3673440	3676440	A bearded man behind a folding table gets turned on.
3678440	3680440	I'm not going to participate in this.
3680440	3681440	You're not?
3681440	3682440	No.
3682440	3683440	What?
3683440	3684440	I'm originally from Maui, which is a very Bogan town.
3684440	3685440	Bogan?
3685440	3686440	Bogan.
3686440	3687440	Wow.
3687440	3688440	Yeah.
3688440	3690440	I only know that because I know Scottish friends, Bogan.
3690440	3691440	Wait, what aren't you participating?
3691440	3692440	What do you mean?
3692440	3693440	I didn't hear that part.
3693440	3694440	She doesn't want to participate.
3694440	3695440	Oh, in this?
3695440	3696440	Oh, you don't have to.
3696440	3697440	For God's sake.
3697440	3698440	I'm up here now.
3698440	3699440	Oh, well, wait.
3699440	3700440	Are you?
3700440	3701440	Come on.
3701440	3702440	What are you?
3702440	3704440	You get to decide whether you want to be up here or not be up here.
3704440	3705440	You're not playing that.
3705440	3708440	I'm interested in what I've got myself into, so we'll play it out.
3708440	3709440	All right.
3709440	3710440	Okay.
3710440	3712440	I mean, it's all right.
3712440	3714440	I shouldn't have made someone come up.
3714440	3715440	Okay.
3715440	3716440	You're going to have a great time.
3716440	3722440	But it's consensual what's happening is my point.
3723440	3726440	Honestly, before I came up here, I thought this was all staged.
3726440	3729440	And now, because I wasn't prepared for this, I know it's not.
3729440	3730440	So it's great.
3730440	3735440	And now the show culminates in her turning into a tiger, at which point you realize the
3735440	3737440	whole thing is staged.
3737440	3740440	What branch of science are you involved in?
3740440	3741440	Pharmaceutical science.
3741440	3742440	All right.
3742440	3743440	All right.
3743440	3744440	Not the good kind.
3744440	3745440	Not the good kind?
3745440	3746440	What do you mean?
3746440	3747440	The bad kind?
3747440	3748440	Poison.
3748440	3751440	I don't get to take the drugs, so it's not that great.
3751440	3754440	So do you manufacture, create them, market them?
3754440	3755440	What do you do?
3755440	3757440	Help lead them into clinical trials.
3757440	3758440	Really?
3758440	3759440	So it's not bad.
3759440	3761440	Do you work for some sort of evil pharmaceutical company?
3761440	3762440	No.
3765440	3766440	But we facilitate them.
3770440	3771440	We don't work for them.
3771440	3773440	We make billions off of them.
3775440	3776440	We're a not-for-profit.
3776440	3777440	Wait.
3777440	3778440	You are?
3778440	3779440	Not-for-profit?
3779440	3782440	Because you can't put a price on hegemony.
3782440	3783440	Exactly.
3783440	3785440	Are non-profits like a big deal here?
3785440	3790440	Like, in America, like, there's for-profit companies that just decide to operate as non-profits
3790440	3792440	in America, because no one gives a fuck.
3792440	3794440	There's probably strict standards here, right?
3794440	3797440	I'm just doing what my boss tells me.
3797440	3798440	Right.
3798440	3800440	No, I never implied you were.
3800440	3802440	I'm sure you're a great employee.
3802440	3803440	Yeah.
3803440	3804440	All right.
3804440	3805440	Well...
3805440	3808440	Are you currently on some of your own supply right now?
3808440	3810440	I wish.
3810440	3811440	This is good.
3811440	3812440	Remember what I said.
3812440	3815440	We're proceeding through volition, and we're going to get our asses kicked, right?
3815440	3816440	Yeah.
3816440	3817440	We met with the goddess.
3817440	3818440	We did what was easy.
3818440	3822440	Now going back up the other side of the circle is a hand-over-hand climb back up into the
3822440	3823440	conscious realm.
3823440	3827440	So now we're going to improvise a role-playing game, because we don't have character sheets.
3827440	3828440	We don't have rules.
3828440	3829440	Right.
3829440	3830440	Now, Bodhi...
3830440	3831440	Bodhi, sorry.
3831440	3836440	Bodhi, I can safely assume that you are a role-playing enthusiast, because you have a
3836440	3838440	sack of dice on you.
3838440	3839440	Yeah.
3839440	3842440	Let's not jump to conclusion.
3842440	3845440	He might just be a weird gambler.
3845440	3848440	The world's kickiest pedophiles.
3848440	3852440	Come on, 19!
3852440	3858440	And Jenna, have you ever played a D&D pathfinder role-playing game before?
3858440	3859440	A murder game?
3859440	3860440	What?
3860440	3861440	It's 9-11.
3861440	3862440	It's 9-11.
3862440	3864440	It kills our crowd.
3865440	3869440	You insensitive antipodians.
3869440	3873440	We have feelings on the other side of the world.
3873440	3874440	All right.
3874440	3878440	That was a horrifying interlude.
3878440	3881440	So have you ever had any experience with this, Jenna, before we proceed?
3881440	3882440	No.
3882440	3885440	I'm more of a game watcher than a game player, because I have rage issues.
3885440	3886440	You have rage issues?
3886440	3887440	Yes.
3887440	3888440	We should be a barbarian.
3888440	3889440	Probably.
3889440	3891440	Is this going to suit me?
3892440	3895440	Spencer will kind of create a little world for us right now.
3895440	3896440	Well, yeah.
3896440	3900440	Do you want to do characters first and then the world or other way around, do you think?
3900440	3902440	She can be a pharmaceutical barbarian.
3902440	3903440	Okay.
3904440	3905440	Bodhi, what do you want to be?
3905440	3908440	A pharmaceutical barbarian is fucking awesome.
3908440	3913440	You like pop a bottle of pills and then you just bust through a wall or something?
3913440	3914440	That'd be amazing.
3914440	3918440	Isn't that kind of the story of Popeye?
3919440	3921440	He's kind of a drug addict barbarian.
3921440	3922440	Hey, don't knock him.
3922440	3923440	He's amazing.
3923440	3924440	He's great.
3924440	3925440	Yeah.
3925440	3926440	Yeah.
3926440	3927440	He's a sailor.
3927440	3928440	All right.
3928440	3929440	Bodhi, what do you want to be?
3929440	3932440	What class and race do you want to be?
3932440	3935440	Is this fantasy?
3935440	3936440	Whatever.
3936440	3937440	Whatever you want.
3937440	3938440	We'll make it work.
3938440	3941440	Let's make it kind of shadow runny if she's a pharmaceutical or post-apocalyptic baby
3941440	3943440	in a George Miller tradition.
3943440	3945440	What's the wizard of that?
3945440	3946440	Yeah.
3946440	3947440	I don't know.
3947440	3948440	Like a psychic or you could just be magic.
3948440	3951440	You pick and then I'll either tell you it's dumb or we'll let it go.
3951440	3958440	Bodhi, what do you love to play in the normal milieu that you play?
3958440	3960440	Wizards, 100%.
3960440	3961440	Yeah.
3961440	3962440	We need a good magic user.
3962440	3963440	So, yeah.
3963440	3964440	Let's get that going on.
3964440	3965440	So, I mean, yeah.
3965440	3967440	You want to just let him be a wizard in this milieu?
3967440	3968440	Yeah.
3968440	3969440	Yeah.
3969440	3970440	No, that's great.
3970440	3971440	All right.
3971440	3983440	He's real smart and is good at talking and entertaining people.
3983440	3985440	All right.
3985440	3988440	Because I always play rogues, I want to go for fighter.
3988440	3990440	I want to be like a tough guy because I'd never do that.
3990440	3991440	All right.
3991440	3993440	So, I'll be like just a straight up.
3993440	3995440	Could you be an elf fighter?
3995440	3996440	Sure.
3996440	3997440	All right.
3997440	4001440	I'm going to be a elf fighter named Smarf.
4001440	4002440	Good.
4002440	4003440	Good.
4003440	4004440	Okay.
4004440	4005440	All right.
4005440	4009440	You want to give them a theme, the music?
4009440	4010440	Oh, yeah.
4010440	4011440	Yeah.
4011440	4012440	Yeah.
4012440	4013440	Let's do that.
4013440	4014440	That's what you guys want.
4014440	4017440	That's what you starve for down in this desert.
4017440	4022440	You want that sweet fucking dungeon master sound.
4022440	4025440	You want to...
4026440	4029440	Nature box.
4029440	4032440	No, I'm not going to do that again.
4032440	4033440	Okay.
4033440	4041440	It's been years since Pauline Henson turned into a robot and took over the entire continent.
4041440	4052440	The scattered peoples of Australia have summoned their will to fight, but have largely been crushed down and pushed to the far corners of the outback.
4052440	4063440	That brings us to today, where our heroes are driving in a ute up towards Ipswich.
4063440	4065440	You find yourself blocked.
4065440	4075440	A roadblock is in your way, guarded by several barbarians, like post-apocalyptic ones with like tire spikes, you know, like Mad Max shit situation.
4075440	4078440	Because that's the world you're in.
4078440	4079440	Okay.
4079440	4084440	Roadblock, barbarians, Mad Max shit, ute, go.
4084440	4085440	All right.
4085440	4086440	Spencer.
4086440	4087440	Ipswich.
4087440	4088440	We're all in the same ute.
4088440	4091440	What's the truck called?
4091440	4092440	What?
4092440	4093440	A ute.
4093440	4094440	Ute?
4094440	4095440	Yes.
4095440	4096440	I hope so.
4096440	4097440	U-T-E?
4097440	4098440	Yes.
4098440	4099440	All right.
4099440	4100440	Like the Native American Indian tribe?
4100440	4101440	Right.
4101440	4102440	Seems offensive.
4102440	4103440	It is.
4103440	4104440	Not here, though.
4104440	4105440	All right.
4105440	4106440	Here you go, folks.
4106440	4107440	Thank you.
4107440	4108440	All right.
4108440	4109440	The dude abodes.
4109440	4110440	All right.
4110440	4111440	I'm drunk.
4111440	4112440	I'm drunk.
4112440	4113440	I'm drunk.
4113440	4114440	No, that's good.
4114440	4115440	Take me to jail.
4115440	4116440	Don't apologize.
4116440	4117440	That was great.
4117440	4118440	I'll just break out.
4118440	4120440	It's all made out of rabbit pelts.
4120440	4125440	All your jails.
4125440	4127440	I think the show's taking a turn.
4127440	4128440	Yeah.
4128440	4129440	It's the atonement.
4129440	4130440	I'm forcing the death of the resurrection.
4130440	4132440	Are there rabbits here?
4132440	4133440	Yeah.
4133440	4134440	Okay.
4134440	4135440	What are those called?
4135440	4136440	Cordobas.
4136440	4137440	Acubra?
4137440	4138440	Acubra?
4138440	4139440	Acubra?
4139440	4140440	Acubra.
4140440	4141440	Jackalopes.
4141440	4143040	The $400 ones are made out of rabbit pelts.
4143040	4144040	We learned that.
4144040	4145040	Oh, Angora?
4145040	4146040	No, wait.
4146040	4147040	Not pelts.
4147040	4148040	Hide.
4148040	4149040	Six rabbits?
4149040	4150040	Six rabbits to make a hat.
4150040	4151040	Six rabbits?
4151040	4152040	Something stupid like that.
4152040	4153040	All right.
4153040	4154040	Black rabbits.
4154040	4155040	Can we not kill them, please?
4155040	4156040	I agree.
4156040	4158600	I feel like I'm fulfilling my end of the bargain.
4158600	4159600	Yeah.
4159600	4160600	Yeah.
4160600	4161600	All right.
4161600	4168800	So I'm driving this ute, because I'm like the tough meathead guy, and I'm driving my
4168800	4177280	ute, but it's also got one of those dudes in the front, and Fury Road that plays guitar.
4177280	4178280	That's me.
4178280	4180800	I'm the bard kind of guy, because I'm like the speaky guy.
4180800	4181800	You're a bard?
4181800	4182800	Well, yeah.
4182800	4183800	I'm a speaky.
4183800	4184800	Yeah.
4184800	4185800	He's a popular, well-liked talky guy.
4185800	4187840	I love talking and making people look like things.
4187840	4188840	What's your name?
4188840	4189840	What's your character's name?
4189840	4190840	Dan.
4191840	4195480	What's your name?
4195480	4197480	Hammo.
4197480	4198480	Hammo.
4198480	4199480	Hammo.
4199480	4200480	Dan Hamo.
4200480	4201480	Dan Hammo.
4201480	4205320	You call me Hammo, because it's a George Miller wasteland.
4205320	4207120	Hey!
4207120	4208600	Hammo.
4208600	4210320	Oi.
4210320	4213760	So we've got company up in front of us.
4213760	4215520	Struth.
4216280	4219960	Is Jenna with us right now?
4219960	4220960	Yeah.
4220960	4221960	You're all together.
4221960	4224720	What's your character's name, Jenna?
4224720	4225720	Can I just be Jenna?
4225720	4226720	Because I've got nothing.
4226720	4227720	Yeah, that's easy.
4227720	4228720	Shazza!
4228720	4232160	We can go with that.
4232160	4233160	It's very Australian.
4233160	4234160	Shazza?
4234160	4235160	Yeah, we'll go with Shazza.
4235160	4236160	That sounds dirty.
4236160	4237160	Yeah.
4237160	4238160	Alright.
4238160	4239160	Oh, boy.
4239160	4240160	And Bode, your character?
4240160	4241160	Philthor, the purifier.
4241160	4242160	Oh, yeah.
4242160	4243160	Philthor?
4243160	4244160	Yeah, Philthor.
4244160	4247160	Like, it's a joke on filtration, I think.
4247160	4248160	Philthor?
4248160	4249160	Philthor.
4249160	4250160	Philthor.
4250160	4251160	Philthor the purifier.
4251160	4252160	I didn't get that.
4252160	4253160	I just loved the passion.
4253160	4254160	Is it?
4254160	4255160	Are you related to Britta?
4255160	4256160	I'm not.
4256160	4257160	I'm not.
4257160	4258160	I'm not.
4258160	4259160	I'm not.
4259160	4260160	I'm not.
4260160	4261160	I'm not.
4261160	4262160	I'm not.
4262160	4263160	I'm not.
4263160	4264160	I'm not.
4264160	4265160	I'm not.
4265160	4266160	I'm not.
4266160	4267160	I'm not.
4267160	4268160	I'm not.
4268160	4269160	I'm not.
4269160	4270160	I'm not.
4270160	4271160	I'm not.
4271160	4279160	Are you related to Britta?
4279160	4281160	Everyone starts shooting at you.
4281160	4282160	Oh, wait.
4282160	4283160	Jesus Christ.
4283160	4284160	God damn it.
4284160	4288960	I turn the car hard left and go into a, like a drift in my ute.
4288960	4299760	And I kick open the passenger door and I take out my sawed off shotgun that has four barrels.
4299760	4301480	Okay.
4301480	4307280	You try to pull a drift, but your car, your ute is too top heavy and it tumbles over.
4307280	4308280	Jesus Christ.
4308280	4311960	You managed to pull yourself out with your shotgun and you're like on top of it.
4311960	4315480	And now Dan is all sprawled out.
4315480	4316480	Dan.
4316480	4321080	You all right, mate?
4321080	4322080	Yeah.
4322080	4327600	Where are the guys, the barbarian guys?
4327600	4329680	They're in front of you.
4329680	4333440	I, I, uh, I, I wave, uh, surrender.
4333440	4343120	I, I, uh, all right, all right, fair dinkum.
4343120	4348780	They hold their multiple rifles above your head and fire several warning shots a couple
4348780	4353160	feet above your head just to show that they're bad ass or cool or something.
4353160	4354160	I got it.
4354160	4355160	I got it.
4355160	4356160	Fair dinkum.
4356160	4358880	Good day, sirs.
4358880	4362160	My name is Dan Hammope.
4362160	4367960	We're merely requesting passage across your wasteland, uh, for, we have, uh, I've got
4367960	4368960	this.
4368960	4373600	I can offer some heroin as a, as a pharmaceutical barbarian.
4373600	4374600	I've got it.
4374600	4376360	I didn't hear most of what she said.
4376360	4377360	She has heroin.
4377360	4378360	She has it.
4378360	4380160	Oh, you just want to let us know.
4380160	4386520	Oh, oh, wait, we, we, we have, we could, we'd be happy to pay a toll for passage in the
4387520	4388520	form of narcotics.
4388520	4389520	Yeah.
4389520	4390520	We'll take that.
4390520	4391520	We'll take all of it.
4391520	4392520	Yeah.
4392520	4394520	Could I, um, whisper, do you know these guys?
4394520	4399000	I don't want to assume, but did you go to the barbarian school or something?
4399000	4400920	I aced barbarian school.
4400920	4402760	Do you recognize them?
4402760	4403760	Barbarian med school.
4403760	4405360	I recognize them.
4405360	4410080	I turned to my, my compatriots and I say, well, uh, I talked to them and they want to
4410080	4412400	take all of our stuff.
4412400	4416680	And I give them that look that says, you guys have talked about this before.
4416680	4421760	I now just duck under behind a thing and you guys go crazy.
4421760	4424440	Um, I say, oh yeah, sure.
4424440	4431440	Uh, Hey, Jenna, uh, give me all of your heroin and I'll go over there and give it to them.
4431440	4436240	And I mean, really give it to them.
4436240	4438960	I'm sure you will.
4438960	4439960	Okay.
4439960	4440960	You, you made it sound sexual.
4440960	4445040	I was trying to make it sound violent.
4445040	4446040	I was not.
4446040	4447040	Okay.
4447040	4461320	Uh, I take the heroin and what, and as I take it from her, I take one of my small, uh, uh,
4461320	4465680	proximity mines, like grenades that I have on my, on my little pouch.
4465680	4471760	And it should be noted that long ago I have this like prosthetic, uh, post this wasteland
4471760	4473040	like prosthetic leg.
4473040	4476140	That's like guitar parts.
4476140	4481920	And I've been strumming a certain, it's like a thing that lowers their armor class or weight
4481920	4483400	raises it.
4483400	4484400	It lowers their defenses.
4484400	4485400	Okay.
4485400	4486600	It lowers enemy defenses.
4486600	4490880	It's like a buff or a, or a, yeah, well, why don't you could, you could make, you can inspire
4490880	4492960	competence and make it easier to hit them.
4492960	4493960	Okay.
4494040	4495040	Yeah.
4495040	4496040	I make my teammates better.
4496040	4497040	Yeah.
4497040	4498040	Yeah.
4498040	4499040	Yeah.
4499040	4513360	I inspire them with like a, it's a critical inspire.
4513360	4516680	And that would have been way more offensive where we come from when it's great to just
4516680	4517680	did it down here.
4517680	4518680	It doesn't matter.
4518680	4521240	Oh, but when I said proximity, man, I meant it's a remote mine.
4521240	4523840	It's like one, I can, I, I just, I attach it as a little tiny thing.
4523840	4529200	I attached the bottom of the bag of heroin and I have a little remote control and I go,
4529200	4532600	okay guys, don't take all of our heroin.
4532600	4537240	I mean, just take, take as much as you need, you know, like, we'll take all of your heroin
4537240	4540680	and even more than that, we'll take other stuff.
4540680	4549040	Maybe we'll take you slaves, you know, whoa, I give them the heroin and I go, Hey, here,
4549040	4550040	here, here.
4550040	4551040	You take the heroin.
4551040	4554440	Back in the Ute, I've got a whole bunch more stuff.
4554440	4555440	I'll be right back.
4555440	4556440	Okay.
4556440	4562880	Hey guys, help me carry all the gold and gasoline over to our, to our captors.
4562880	4567800	And we all kind of walk back out of range of my, my explosive device.
4567800	4568800	All right.
4568800	4574080	Barbarian guy one, he motions to someone else to come over and test the heroin.
4574080	4579520	He's kind of poking around with his finger and like touching it to his eye and stuff.
4579520	4584760	Are they all, how closely grouped are they to the heroin?
4584760	4587760	They're about five meters across.
4587760	4588760	They're kind of spread out.
4588760	4589920	There's about seven of them.
4589920	4592320	And then there's maybe three of them that you can think of.
4592320	4593320	Okay.
4593320	4594320	My character doesn't know metric.
4594320	4606520	Oh, you're an Australia bitch.
4606520	4607520	Five meters as well.
4607520	4608520	Like 15 feet.
4608520	4609520	Okay.
4609520	4610520	I know it's five meters.
4610520	4613720	I say, uh, yeah, guys, it's the best heroin in town.
4613720	4614720	Get right in there.
4614720	4618120	And we're going to carry the shit over to you.
4618120	4624520	And then when we're far enough out of range, I, uh, the detonation device I have in my
4624520	4626640	cyber eye, cause I have a cyborg eye.
4626640	4627640	Oh, of course.
4627640	4634680	And whenever I want things to blow up, I go, I wink and I, I, I detonate the, uh, the explosive
4634680	4635680	heroin.
4635680	4636680	All right.
4637680	4638680	Okay.
4638680	4639680	Yeah.
4639680	4640680	All right.
4640680	4648040	Your mind blows up, tearing them limb from limb, three of the barbarians and knocking
4648040	4650040	the other four to the ground.
4650040	4655120	Did we, did we lose our shit anyway?
4655120	4656120	You welcome.
4656120	4657120	Thank you.
4657120	4658120	Jack, Bodie, get them.
4658120	4665640	Could I, could I do like an atmospheric smoke effect around us with my sand punk star?
4665640	4666640	Yeah.
4666640	4668840	Waving your hands in a magical manner.
4668840	4670840	You kick up a dust shield.
4670840	4673080	Good job, Bodie.
4673080	4674080	Good job.
4674080	4675080	Wait.
4675080	4680420	Can, can we still see them now or were we all just hiding behind a dust wall?
4680420	4684600	You can't see too well.
4684600	4690120	So we had, we had the upper hand and now we're just in a dust storm.
4690120	4691120	Let's get to the Ute.
4691120	4693000	Everyone feel around for the Ute.
4693000	4696080	Oh, you can see the Ute, but it's on its side now.
4696080	4697080	It's on its side.
4697080	4698080	Oh, yeah.
4698080	4699080	That's right.
4699080	4701680	No, we got to finish these barbarians off and, and, and steal what they got.
4701680	4702880	This is a, this is a wasteland.
4702880	4703880	We got to get their goods.
4703880	4704880	We got to steal what they got?
4704880	4705880	Yeah.
4705880	4708800	That's like, uh, uh, sucking on a mosquito.
4708800	4709800	They were robbing us.
4709800	4711160	They don't have anything.
4711160	4712160	Maybe they rob everybody.
4712160	4713160	Maybe they're the richest people in town.
4713160	4714160	Maybe they rob everybody.
4714160	4716880	That's what I just said.
4716880	4717880	Maybe they rob everybody.
4717880	4718880	Yeah.
4718880	4719880	Maybe they rob everybody.
4719880	4720880	That's not bad.
4721000	4726240	What barbarian, what kind of barbarian doesn't rob everybody?
4726240	4730120	Why don't barbarians rob other barbarians?
4730120	4731320	They'd have all the stuff.
4731320	4732320	They rob people.
4732320	4733320	Uh, all right.
4733320	4734320	Yeah.
4734320	4735320	Okay.
4735320	4736320	All right.
4736320	4737320	All right.
4737320	4743120	Well, uh, Jenna, what is your specialty again?
4743120	4745200	You're a pharmaceutical.
4745200	4746200	Pharmaceutical barbarian.
4746200	4747200	Yeah.
4747200	4748200	Go get him.
4748200	4750200	Can I get him with what?
4750920	4751920	Take drugs and beat them.
4751920	4752920	I already got him to take heroin.
4752920	4754920	Surely that'll like lock them in and they'll be right.
4754920	4757560	They'll do it die eventually from their habit.
4757560	4758560	Yeah.
4758560	4759560	Eventually.
4759560	4764160	But don't you have like a, don't you have like a slow, it's a slow thing, but it'll
4764160	4765160	work.
4765160	4766160	Bullets cut through the air.
4766160	4767160	Jesus.
4767160	4770440	Will you, you said in your contract with us, you would take drugs and beat people.
4770440	4772560	You said that was your thing.
4772560	4774240	I have still not been offered cocaine.
4774240	4775240	That would make me angry.
4775240	4777040	And that would definitely make me do that.
4777040	4779840	Take the cocaine in on your couch.
4779840	4782280	I take cocaine and I bash everybody up.
4782280	4783280	Right.
4783280	4784280	Okay.
4784280	4791680	Who came here tonight with your parents just, you know, thanks for convincing them to drive
4791680	4792680	you down.
4792680	4796120	My parents aren't here because they'd be so disappointed in me right now.
4796120	4799920	She's going into a cocaine field barbarian rage right now.
4799920	4800920	All right.
4800920	4801920	So who do you want?
4801920	4804400	How are you going to attack?
4804400	4806600	I'm going to be all legs.
4806600	4807600	Okay.
4807600	4813800	Not a lot of people have an answer to that.
4813800	4814800	That's great.
4814800	4815800	All right.
4815800	4820320	So leaping into the dust shield, you take a bullet to the shoulder, but you wrap your
4820320	4833120	legs tightly around one of the barbarians popping his head clean off.
4833120	4834120	That's all.
4835120	4836960	Whose turn is it?
4836960	4837960	I don't care.
4837960	4847160	I use relentless voice shout.
4847160	4850960	It's a Nord thing from Skyrim.
4850960	4854760	I learned it at the throat of the world.
4854760	4855760	What does it do?
4855760	4866320	It creates a force in a radius equivalent to my level that removes outward diminishing
4866320	4875400	one foot pound per hex as it knocks any ready warriors back into a stunned position and
4875400	4879280	makes flat footed any previously alerted monsters.
4879280	4884200	I stopped paying attention with Steve Jobs.
4884200	4886080	You do that.
4886080	4887080	It works.
4887080	4894200	They're all flat footed.
4894200	4899760	Also the force, it knocks clean the roadblock, but yeah, the truck's still on its side.
4899760	4902120	Let's take one of their barbarian trucks or let's each.
4902120	4903120	They don't have trucks.
4903120	4904120	Oh, wait.
4904120	4905120	Okay.
4905120	4906120	You guys should get trucks.
4906120	4909000	We still have a youth there, right?
4909000	4913280	Am I strong enough to write the truck on my ownership?
4913280	4914280	Is that a teamwork?
4914280	4915280	You don't know.
4915280	4916280	Hey, everybody.
4916280	4917280	Let's try.
4917280	4918280	Wait.
4918280	4919280	I'm in a cocaine rage.
4919280	4920280	Hey, hey.
4920280	4921280	Cocaine McTavish.
4921280	4924280	Go set the truck right.
4924280	4925280	Yeah, I can do that.
4925280	4926280	All right.
4926280	4927280	Yeah.
4927280	4928280	It's done.
4928280	4929280	Yeah.
4929280	4930280	It's done.
4930280	4932360	So confident.
4932360	4933360	It's all legs.
4933360	4934360	It's all legs.
4934360	4938960	Yeah, because you're supposed to lift from the legs and if you're all legs, then you're
4939560	4940560	perfect.
4940560	4941560	That's all you got.
4941560	4942560	It's all I've got.
4942560	4943560	I go over to...
4943560	4945840	Are they all dead or are they all just stunned or what's going on?
4945840	4946840	No, no.
4946840	4947840	There's three alive.
4947840	4950920	Bullets continue to cut through the air.
4950920	4952960	Let's jump in the car and just mow them down.
4952960	4957920	So we get back in the utes and I hit the gas pedal and aim at them.
4957920	4962400	Can I do like an unseen servant thing to drive so none of us have to feel bad about it?
4962400	4963400	Oh, sure.
4963400	4964400	Okay.
4964400	4965400	Nice.
4965400	4966400	That's very culturally sensitive.
4967400	4970400	That really is a new outback.
4976400	4977400	All right.
4977400	4979400	They've really learned to cringe here.
4979400	4981400	Hamo, you take a bullet in the arm.
4981400	4982400	Ow!
4982400	4985400	I didn't sign up for this.
4985400	4986400	I'm old.
4986400	4988400	I'm old too old for this.
4988400	4991400	I suck the bullet out of his arm.
4991400	4992400	All right.
4992400	4993400	It's great.
4993400	4994400	And I spit it.
4995400	4996400	Probably not going to work.
4996400	5001400	But I spit it as hard as I can back at them to see if I can shoot.
5001400	5004400	It goes a good seven feet, but it doesn't hit anyone.
5004400	5005400	It's pretty good.
5005400	5006400	It's good.
5006400	5007400	It's pretty good.
5007400	5010400	I think I said the message.
5010400	5013400	So where's the unseen servant driving then?
5013400	5015400	Oh, just into the barbarian.
5015400	5016400	Oh, yeah.
5016400	5017400	All right.
5017400	5019400	You run over one of them.
5019400	5020400	Just one.
5020400	5023400	The other two kind of roll off to the side.
5023400	5025400	So none of us have to feel bad about running people over.
5025400	5026400	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5026400	5028400	I thought you meant about the servitude.
5028400	5029400	Oh.
5029400	5030400	Yeah, you don't see it.
5030400	5034400	I thought he meant that someone wouldn't have to feel bad about driving.
5034400	5035400	Just the other people.
5035400	5037400	Like, there wouldn't have to be a class system.
5037400	5040400	That's why I praised him.
5040400	5043400	I'm American and rich.
5043400	5044400	All right.
5044400	5045400	Sorry.
5045400	5046400	You were saying we're not.
5046400	5047400	No, no.
5047400	5050400	You continue past the roadblock with your momentum.
5050400	5053400	You've passed the barbarians that are still alive.
5053400	5054400	Yeah.
5054400	5059400	I roll down the window and flip them off.
5059400	5060400	All right.
5060400	5061400	That happens.
5061400	5062400	Okay.
5062400	5063400	Fair dinkum.
5063400	5064400	All right.
5064400	5067400	We got to get into Ipswich.
5067400	5069400	I think I know the way.
5069400	5071400	I have local knowledge.
5071400	5072400	It's 11.
5072400	5074400	Yeah, yeah.
5074400	5076400	You know everyone knows where it is.
5076400	5078400	Oh, well, up yours.
5078400	5079400	Yeah, yeah.
5079400	5080400	All right.
5080400	5082400	So I drive us towards Ipswich.
5082400	5087400	And you guys, we're going into the belly of the beast right now.
5087400	5088400	You guys understand this?
5088400	5089400	Yeah.
5089400	5090400	Let's get Pauline.
5090400	5091400	Okay.
5091400	5098400	You're on the outskirts of Ipswich, but it seems that there's a giant chasm in the road.
5098400	5100400	It's Pauline.
5100400	5104400	It's barring your forward progress in a ute.
5104400	5108400	How wide is the chasm?
5108400	5110400	Four meters.
5110400	5112400	Four meters?
5112400	5113400	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
5113400	5114400	You can jump that.
5114400	5115400	Seven meters.
5115400	5116400	Seven meters.
5116400	5117400	That's what I meant.
5117400	5118400	All right.
5118400	5122400	I get out of the ute and I go to the edge of the chasm.
5122400	5125400	I scratch my chin.
5125400	5130400	Pauline!
5130400	5131400	I hear no echo.
5131400	5132400	Yeah.
5133400	5144400	I look down and this chasm is kind of beautiful.
5144400	5146400	It's kind of like the Grand Canyon.
5146400	5152400	I take a moment to look at our group and I say, it has a serenity.
5152400	5153400	It's good.
5153400	5154400	It's good.
5154400	5155400	So much serenity.
5155400	5157400	Can I be peeing?
5157400	5158400	Oh, always.
5158400	5159400	Yeah.
5159400	5160400	Like into the chasm.
5160400	5161400	Sure.
5161400	5162400	He's peeing.
5162400	5164400	I've had too many drugs and I've already passed out.
5164400	5166400	You passed out on coke?
5166400	5167400	Yeah.
5167400	5170400	That's impressive.
5170400	5172400	I didn't know you could do that.
5172400	5174400	I'm not a well-trained drug taker.
5174400	5175400	Okay.
5175400	5176400	All right.
5176400	5177400	Wizard.
5177400	5178400	Bodhi.
5178400	5179400	Filthor.
5179400	5183400	Do you have a spell that could get us across this chasm?
5183400	5188400	What?
5189400	5192400	Did you just cast magic heckler?
5192400	5194400	He said might or something.
5194400	5195400	He said flight.
5195400	5196400	Oh, flight.
5196400	5197400	Yeah.
5197400	5198400	I thought he said might.
5198400	5199400	Like he's just like might.
5199400	5201400	He's just like Australian just like malfunctioning.
5201400	5202400	Might.
5202400	5204400	Might.
5204400	5205400	Outback.
5205400	5206400	Outback.
5206400	5208400	Crocsplash him.
5213400	5214400	Seven meters.
5214400	5216400	I've got a bunch of rope in the back.
5217400	5224400	We could try to grappling hook across this and do a little fashion of a crude rope bridge.
5224400	5226400	Or unless you've got a sexy spell.
5226400	5228400	Filthor.
5228400	5231400	I can help out with magic and so we don't have to throw it.
5231400	5233400	All right.
5233400	5236400	Crude rope bridge montage.
5236400	5239400	It's in the way that you use it.
5239400	5240400	Do do.
5240400	5243400	Come let it go.
5243400	5244400	Do do.
5244400	5247400	You know there's only one thing wrong with this crude rope bridge.
5247400	5248400	What?
5248400	5251400	Two non crude.
5251400	5253400	It's a real rope bridge.
5253400	5256400	We're wonderful together.
5256400	5259400	Can someone please remember to carry my body?
5259400	5263400	I pick up Jenna and throw her over my shoulder like fireman style.
5263400	5264400	All right.
5264400	5265400	Bodhi.
5265400	5266400	Cast.
5266400	5267400	Filthor.
5267400	5268400	Filthor.
5268400	5271400	Part of the magic was that I used her body as the counterweight on this side.
5271400	5272400	Oh.
5273400	5274400	I put her back.
5274400	5276400	We can pull her over later.
5276400	5277400	Sorry.
5277400	5278400	I'm not smart.
5278400	5280400	I have an intelligence of three.
5280400	5283400	I've been left behind but I'm out of it so who knows.
5283400	5285400	No but we can pull you over.
5285400	5286400	Yeah.
5286400	5287400	You're attached to that.
5287400	5288400	We can just hoist you back over across the...
5288400	5291400	You might come thumping into the opposite wall.
5291400	5293400	Look what I don't know won't hurt me.
5293400	5294400	Exactly right.
5294400	5300400	You're into one of those sleepy coke bench things that happens to nobody.
5303400	5306400	I picked the wrong class.
5306400	5308400	I picked a guy that just talks.
5308400	5309400	That's all I am.
5309400	5311400	Yeah but what's that...
5311400	5312400	You got a pretty fancy...
5312400	5313400	What's that big staff?
5313400	5318400	That big wooden stick that you have attached to your knapsack there.
5318400	5321400	It looks kind of mystical and magical.
5324400	5328400	You mean the eye of everything?
5328400	5331400	It's called the eye of everything?
5331400	5333400	I push the center of the eye.
5333400	5335400	It gets stuck.
5344400	5345400	The button gets stuck?
5345400	5346400	Yeah.
5346400	5347400	No the button gets stuck.
5347400	5348400	Oh okay.
5348400	5351400	Well then I won't use it again.
5351400	5353400	I think that's a really old callback.
5353400	5355400	It's from the movie.
5355400	5358400	We made a movie about ourselves and they watched it.
5358400	5360400	We really owe them a lot.
5360400	5362400	It's more than just a ticket price.
5362400	5365400	We're all across the bridge except for Jenna.
5365400	5371400	I use my macho strength and I pull her across and hoist her up.
5371400	5373400	Thank you.
5373400	5374400	Oh you're awake?
5374400	5375400	A little bit.
5375400	5379400	She just smashed into the wall and I woke her up.
5379400	5380400	Of course.
5380400	5385400	While you were passed out we used you to counterweight our bridge.
5386400	5393400	I don't want to say you're putting on weight but we use you to counterweight our bridge.
5394400	5397400	Never talk about a woman's weight okay?
5397400	5399400	I was making a joke.
5399400	5402400	You're a tiny little whisper of a thing.
5402400	5403400	I appreciate it.
5403400	5406400	We hit a point where we killed the barbarians.
5406400	5409400	We could have ended it there.
5409400	5411400	No we're across the chasm now.
5411400	5412400	This is a threshold.
5412400	5413400	To what end?
5413400	5414400	To Ipswich.
5416400	5418400	You're going to give up now?
5418400	5422400	One button gets stuck and you just fucking want to call it a day.
5423400	5425400	You know I don't know if I like your style.
5425400	5427400	Damn, Hamo.
5429400	5434400	Do you mean to say that even though we met with the goddess now that things are falling apart?
5434400	5443400	I think that maybe it's time that we should split up company and find out if flight can be magic.
5444400	5445400	I hate you.
5445400	5448400	I never knew my parents.
5449400	5450400	We're fighting.
5451400	5452400	I go away.
5452400	5453400	Okay.
5454400	5455400	Yes I can.
5455400	5456400	You're down with this.
5457400	5458400	Guys.
5459400	5461400	You're turning into Twitter.
5464400	5467400	You can't be as drunk as me.
5467400	5469400	I was the one up here with a fifth of vodka.
5470400	5477400	I mad at Jeff and I punch a rock and I eat it in iguana.
5479400	5482400	We're not friends anymore and conflict, conflict.
5482400	5488400	If you want to be a dick about it, me, Bodhi and Jenna will get in my truck and we'll take care of business ourselves.
5488400	5490400	Fine, I hope I never see you again.
5490400	5491400	I'm going with him.
5491400	5492400	You're going to go with him?
5492400	5493400	I'm going to go with him.
5493400	5494400	You know what?
5494400	5495400	Fuck both of you then.
5495400	5497400	Fucking made a bridge.
5497400	5502400	A bridge is metaphorical for crossing the difficult from one place to the other.
5502400	5507400	I say whoever kills Pauline Henson and Ipswich is the real post-apocalyptic warriors.
5507400	5508400	All right.
5510400	5513400	Phil Torre, you coming with me or you going with these ding-dongs?
5513400	5514400	I'm with you.
5514400	5515400	All right.
5515400	5518400	We get into the ute and we just hit the pedal.
5518400	5520400	We'll see you at the finish line.
5520400	5521400	Dick suck.
5521400	5522400	Jenna.
5522400	5523400	Jenna's character.
5523400	5525400	Give us Adderall.
5525400	5526400	You got Adderall?
5526400	5530400	I mean, I am the one with the drug, so we all know I'm going to win.
5530400	5531400	Right?
5531400	5532400	Well, you're walking.
5532400	5534400	I'm driving at full speed.
5536400	5539400	See, I've invented this drug that means that we can run at Superman speed.
5539400	5540400	So we're going to beat you.
5540400	5541400	I said Adderall.
5541400	5542400	Give me the...
5544400	5545400	Give us the...
5545400	5546400	It's up there.
5546400	5549400	It's the orange tube on your shoulder.
5549400	5550400	Break it open.
5551400	5552400	She does.
5557400	5560400	Whatever you need.
5560400	5561400	What's that?
5561400	5563400	I said, whatever you need.
5563400	5565400	Yeah, I take whatever I need.
5565400	5566400	Nice.
5567400	5569400	Art imitates life.
5569400	5570400	Oh, no.
5570400	5571400	Oh, boy.
5572400	5575400	I just realized, why is the show dragging?
5577400	5580400	I have a medical condition.
5581400	5583400	I got the ADD real bad.
5584400	5586400	That's what they all say.
5586400	5587400	All right, now we're running.
5587400	5589400	We've got the ADD.
5592400	5593400	We're running.
5593400	5594400	Apparently we're running.
5594400	5595400	All right.
5595400	5596400	Well, we're driving.
5596400	5597400	Where are you guys going?
5597400	5598400	To Ipswich.
5598400	5599400	To Ipswich.
5601400	5602400	But you're split up?
5602400	5604400	Yeah, because we're fighting.
5604400	5607400	We're going through second act crisis.
5607400	5608400	There was conflict.
5608400	5610400	No, I got there as conflict.
5610400	5614400	Now, it just seems like you're doing the same thing.
5614400	5618400	They're trying to run in Superman's speed because they take super drugs.
5618400	5620400	And then we'll end up working together.
5620400	5622400	Filter the purifier and we're in the car.
5622400	5624400	We're going fucking hell for leather.
5624400	5626400	We're limitless, right?
5626400	5627400	Like the movie.
5627400	5629400	I can't hear you driving.
5630400	5632400	You know, it's like we're not working together.
5632400	5634400	That's send it in the text.
5634400	5637400	You continue to drive.
5637400	5642400	You see the buildings and shacks of Ipswich.
5642400	5645400	But out of the corner of your eye, you see a brown blur.
5645400	5649400	A kangaroo smashes into your windshield, knocking your car off the road.
5649400	5651400	I mean, you're you'd off the road.
5652400	5653400	Well, you're fucked.
5659400	5661400	We run past it.
5661400	5664400	Oh, no, this is like miles ahead of you.
5664400	5665400	We're running.
5665400	5666400	We run toward it.
5666400	5668400	We have the agility, but you are fucked.
5669400	5671400	The car is totaled.
5671400	5673400	The ute is totaled.
5673400	5674400	Is the kangaroo alive or dead?
5674400	5676400	Oh, yeah, it's alive.
5676400	5681400	It's shaking itself like it's head and it's like getting up, you know, in pain.
5681400	5686400	Filter, can you can you cast a spell that you can you can you possess that kangaroo
5686400	5691400	and kick Jenna and and and hammer his ass again?
5692400	5694400	You're way behind us.
5694400	5695400	Way behind.
5695400	5700400	You're way behind us like like like make the kangaroo like a threshold guardian to slow
5700400	5703400	them down so we can just keep we can keep pressing on the kangaroos.
5703400	5704400	Like don't know.
5704400	5706400	No talking kangaroo.
5706400	5708400	Yeah, I'm a fucking kangaroo.
5708400	5712400	What the hell the hell do you think I am?
5712400	5714400	I will happily punch a kangaroo in the face.
5714400	5715400	So it's not a problem.
5715400	5716400	Miles away.
5716400	5720400	Kangaroo.
5720400	5722400	We need to get to Ipswich.
5722400	5723400	We're sorry about hitting you.
5723400	5726400	Can you carry us in your pouch to Ipswich?
5726400	5728400	Yeah, my name's not kangaroo.
5728400	5732400	Sorry, I was being mammal normative.
5732400	5733400	Well, it's fine.
5733400	5735400	I understand why.
5735400	5736400	It's just a bit rude.
5736400	5737400	What is your name?
5737400	5739400	Charles.
5739400	5740400	Charles.
5740400	5742400	It's my one name I think of.
5742400	5743400	Quick, filter.
5743400	5745400	Let's hop on the pouch and we'll make a call.
5745400	5747400	We'll make it worth your while, Charles.
5747400	5748400	What the fuck?
5748400	5750400	You just have all these designs on me.
5750400	5751400	I'm sorry.
5751400	5753400	I busted up your car.
5753400	5755400	I was just trying to cross the road.
5755400	5756400	Why?
5756400	5761400	Because we're trying to gather.
5761400	5764400	Yeah, we're trying to gather the resistance.
5764400	5767400	We're planning a big assault.
5767400	5768400	The kangaroo resistance?
5768400	5770400	Yeah, we're fucking king.
5770400	5772400	What the hell do you think we are?
5773400	5775400	We lead the resistance.
5775400	5777400	Take us to the kangaroo resistance.
5777400	5778400	We'll help.
5778400	5779400	We want to join your cause.
5779400	5781400	All right, hop in.
5786400	5788400	Meanwhile...
5790400	5792400	I think we're going to do good.
5792400	5794400	I swear I could see up ahead.
5794400	5796400	It looks like they got into some trouble.
5796400	5801400	You see a total beaut and kangaroo prince leading away.
5801400	5803400	Looks like a kangaroo ate him.
5805400	5807400	It's honestly fair enough.
5807400	5810400	We don't even have to probably fight Pauline Henson in order to win.
5810400	5812400	I feel like we could go home right now and everything would be okay.
5812400	5814400	Let's go harm.
5815400	5817400	Sorry, sorry.
5818400	5819400	I'm on your team.
5819400	5820400	Don't fuck with me.
5820400	5821400	All right.
5821400	5822400	But let's...
5822400	5825400	Okay, let's go to Ipswich anyway because that's where I live.
5825400	5832400	You get to your house on the outskirts of Ipswich.
5832400	5834400	To think this is where it all began.
5834400	5836400	Come in.
5836400	5839400	Opening the tiny round door.
5839400	5841400	Crawling in.
5841400	5842400	I'm not a...
5842400	5845400	I'm a normal sized person, but I built like a hobbit sized home.
5845400	5849400	So I could always feel like a visiting wizard.
5849400	5851400	My therapist.
5856400	5858400	You look over...
5858400	5859400	Wait, what?
5859400	5860400	Whoa.
5860400	5862400	Whoa.
5862400	5865400	Well, let's see how this plays out at least.
5865400	5872400	You look over and on the horizon you see a huge like wall, a column of kangaroos.
5872400	5882400	And on the two biggest kangaroos, Filtar the purifier and I, Smarf, are writing them like tontons.
5883400	5887400	And we have like, we're like honorary kangaroo people now.
5887400	5891400	But I've done like a spell to make the ones that were on like Godzilla kangaroos.
5891400	5892400	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5892400	5894400	He cast super kangaroo.
5894400	5900400	Yeah, and I produce the eye of everything and I show it to the kangaroo.
5900400	5903400	And I look down at my kangaroo and go, don't worry.
5903400	5905400	It's the button stuck.
5906400	5908400	Shit don't work.
5908400	5909400	All right.
5909400	5911400	The kangaroos hop forward.
5911400	5913400	They're ranks approaching.
5913400	5920400	The line of kangaroos stretches as far as the eye can see and they're just steadily moving forward.
5920400	5922400	They're about 40 feet off now.
5922400	5925400	Call up to luck, toy, c-c-c-toy.
5928400	5931400	This is my kangaroo-y cry.
5933400	5936400	Call up to luck, c-c-c-toy.
5937400	5940400	All the kangaroos all know.
5942400	5944400	I hope this fails.
5947400	5950400	I hope that's racist kangaroo.
5951400	5953400	They stop.
5953400	5954400	They stop.
5954400	5956400	Hello, Nick.
5957400	5959400	Who's that, too?
5959400	5961400	The head kangaroo, the biggest one.
5961400	5965400	The biggest one is being written by Phil Torr.
5966400	5968400	Hello, Nick.
5968400	5970400	Hey.
5970400	5976400	It would appear the apocalypse makes for strange bedfellows.
5976400	5979400	I say to Nick and Charles.
5981400	5985400	First off, before I get to the meat and potatoes, what I'm going to say.
5985400	5988400	Whimsical names, you kangaroos, give each other.
5988400	5991400	And second, I say don't bother with these two.
5991400	5993400	They're not going to help.
5993400	5998400	First thing they want to do is give up and walk away when the shit is hitting the fan.
5998400	6000400	Yeah, I'm certain that's true.
6000400	6004400	But all the same, he used the sacred kangaroo call, and we must respect that.
6004400	6008400	Excuse me, but I refuse to lose.
6008400	6011400	I never said you wouldn't do that.
6011400	6012400	Yeah, good.
6012400	6016400	And isn't that the Australian spirit that unites all of them?
6016400	6018400	Be they Labour or Liberal?
6018400	6021400	Be they Ipswichian or Brisbaneian?
6021400	6029400	All Australians are the same in that they are the one-seventh of the planet that will remain when the rest has gone to naught.
6029400	6035400	For they are pre-abandoned.
6037400	6044400	They know not the shame of isolationism, nor the intimidation of global trade.
6044400	6051400	They have always been confused and happy and jocular, you fucking prick.
6056400	6072400	And is it not written in the Australian Bill of Rights that the prison marshals wrote on the coast of Perth when they first founded this island nation?
6072400	6078400	Does it not say that all men are equal to kangaroos?
6078400	6079400	And women.
6079400	6080400	What's that hand?
6080400	6081400	All men and women.
6081400	6084400	Right, it says that, I'm sure.
6084400	6087400	I'm sure, because the document's older than 40 years.
6087400	6093400	I'm sure it was definitely super non-misogynist.
6093400	6097400	Anything other than a Judy Blume novel, I'm sure.
6098400	6109400	But anyways, I forgot my point, and I'm bad at ending these things, but my name is Dan Hammo, and I think we should all team up.
6109400	6122400	Nature, man, scientist, wizard, speaker, elf person, fighter, and defeat Pauline Hanson.
6122400	6129400	Once and for all, easy target may she be creatively.
6129400	6133400	She will prove a tough adversary in this narrative.
6133400	6140400	Jenna, do you have anything that you can give to the kangaroo army that will enhance their powers as we attack?
6140400	6141400	I'm not going to help you.
6141400	6142400	You're not going to help?
6142400	6144400	I'm definitely not going to help.
6144400	6145400	Okay.
6145400	6148400	I'm against you. I feel like I'm against you.
6148400	6150400	Okay, all right.
6151400	6155400	Or maybe, wait, do you feel like some MDMA?
6155400	6158400	Uh, yeah, yeah.
6158400	6163400	Before we attack, let's all just trip fucking hard.
6163400	6166400	Let's roll like fucking tumbleweeds.
6166400	6168400	All right.
6168400	6171400	Do you have enough for the whole kangaroo army?
6171400	6173400	I always have enough.
6173400	6174400	I love that.
6174400	6177400	All right, we take that, and now we're ready to...
6177400	6179400	Wait, MDMA is ecstasy, right?
6179400	6180400	Yeah.
6180400	6182400	You're now less ready.
6185400	6187400	We're not worthless.
6187400	6188400	Well, let's wait.
6188400	6189400	We can listen to some...
6189400	6192400	The kangaroos feel the walls.
6194400	6197400	Oh my God, this pouch is so soft.
6197400	6199400	Feel this pouch, you guys.
6199400	6200400	This is amazing.
6200400	6201400	What is it?
6201400	6202400	Is that slime?
6202400	6204400	It's so nice.
6204400	6206400	You guys, we don't call each other enough.
6208400	6210400	Why do we only talk to each other when we're rolling?
6210400	6211400	We don't always talk.
6211400	6212400	We should be talking.
6212400	6215400	I don't even have your number on my phone.
6215400	6217400	We definitely need to hang out, though.
6217400	6220400	I'm going to grind everyone's teeth.
6223400	6226400	We don't grind each other's teeth enough.
6226400	6232400	I say, is it weird that we're kind of reclaiming Australia from reclaim Australia?
6233400	6235400	It's like political things.
6236400	6238400	I can't hear most of what you're...
6238400	6239400	You got to eat that mic.
6239400	6240400	Sorry.
6240400	6244400	Well, I don't want to ruin your joke, but I didn't understand it.
6245400	6251400	Is it kind of ironic that we're reclaiming Australia from reclaim Australia, kind of?
6251400	6253400	That's a political slogan.
6253400	6254400	It's like a bunch of racists.
6254400	6255400	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6255400	6258400	Just stay here a bit longer and you'll understand it.
6258400	6259400	I don't want to.
6259400	6261400	Listen, it's all topsy-turvy.
6261400	6264400	I come from the land up over.
6265400	6273400	There's a guy who began his political career by making the black president prove he wasn't a secret foreigner,
6273400	6277400	who's more Russian than a James Bond villain.
6277400	6279400	It's fucking insane right now.
6279400	6285400	I'm going to eat a brick of glass and just bang my head into a wall and die.
6285400	6288400	No, I'm never happy ever anymore.
6288400	6293400	I was wiping my ass the other day and I used too much toilet paper on accident
6293400	6296400	and then I thought, why do I care how much toilet paper I use?
6296400	6300400	Trump got elected and then I just used a million pounds of toilet paper
6300400	6302400	and I stuffed my toilet.
6302400	6304400	My own toilet!
6305400	6309400	There's no system getting destroyed except my own toilet and my own planet.
6309400	6311400	But I'm like, everything is...
6311400	6314400	That's what's happening back over and over and over.
6314400	6316400	Dude, you got some bad Molly, bro.
6319400	6322400	Yeah, I'm freaking out, man. I feel like the pavement is dinosaur skin.
6322400	6325400	I apologize. I'm not the cleanest of makers.
6326400	6327400	Right.
6327400	6328400	I just use what's at hand.
6328400	6330400	I got it. I got it.
6332400	6334400	She stepped on this shit, man.
6334400	6335400	No!
6336400	6338400	She put God knows what in it.
6338400	6340400	All right, let's go. Let's go.
6340400	6342400	Yeah, I'm coming down. Let's go attack.
6342400	6343400	Let's go attack.
6343400	6346400	We go up to the Death Star or whatever we were fighting.
6348400	6349400	Third act.
6349400	6350400	Yeah.
6350400	6354400	The kangaroos are advancing on the... God damn it.
6354400	6356400	What's her name? Pauline Hanson?
6356400	6357400	Yeah.
6357400	6359400	Pauline Hanson's stronghold.
6359400	6361400	We don't care about her.
6361400	6362400	Okay.
6363400	6364400	What do you do?
6364400	6366400	Let her die.
6366400	6368400	She's a robot.
6368400	6372400	Robots can't die. They must be destroyed.
6372400	6374400	Or, you know, left alone. I don't know.
6375400	6377400	Let's go get her.
6377400	6378400	Let's go get her.
6378400	6380400	I was describing that.
6380400	6382400	I know. Well, then she said she doesn't, you know...
6382400	6384400	No, no, I get it.
6384400	6385400	It's great.
6387400	6389400	Mortar shells rain down.
6389400	6390400	Oh, God.
6390400	6397400	Exploding bursts of dirt and sand as kangaroo parts are ripped asunder
6397400	6402400	like so much mispackaged and mislabeled meats.
6403400	6405400	That happens.
6405400	6406400	Yeah.
6406400	6410400	You make it to the wall. They're now too close to shell.
6410400	6413400	All right. I start climbing the wall.
6413400	6414400	Okay.
6414400	6415400	Me too.
6415400	6416400	All right.
6416400	6417400	You get to the top of the wall.
6417400	6418400	Wait, what?
6418400	6420400	I like to, like, double-balance on the kangaroo.
6420400	6423400	So when it bounces, I do the double like a trampoline.
6423400	6424400	Right.
6427400	6428400	Nice.
6428400	6429400	Nice.
6432400	6434400	I love double-bouncing.
6434400	6437400	I was just going to boost people, but I feel like that does jack shit,
6437400	6439400	so I'm going to step out.
6439400	6442400	Wait, I didn't hear it. You're going to boost what?
6442400	6444400	I was just going to give everyone a boost.
6444400	6447400	Like, I feel like I'm no use, so I'm just going to, like, prop everyone else up.
6447400	6449400	Oh, nice.
6449400	6450400	Yeah.
6450400	6454400	Working together. You scale the wall.
6454400	6457400	And or double-bounce up the wall.
6458400	6460400	Now you're at the top of the wall.
6460400	6463400	You see several small, spindly robots
6463400	6466400	actuating various mortars and howitzers
6466400	6470400	at the top of the wall of the stronghold of Hanson.
6470400	6472400	I got this.
6473400	6479400	Whoo!
6479400	6482400	Laser.
6482400	6485400	Shout.
6485400	6487400	All right.
6487400	6491400	A focused beam of audio energy
6492400	6494400	taught to me by the Grey Beards
6494400	6498400	atop Mount Hrothgar in Skyrim.
6500400	6501400	All right.
6501400	6503400	You scream loudly.
6503400	6507400	Your breathy burst of voice
6507400	6509400	echoes out over the ram parts
6509400	6512400	and smashes into the spindly robots
6512400	6514400	dealing 26 damage.
6514400	6517400	Oh, yeah.
6517400	6520400	The robot falls all to pieces.
6520400	6522400	They both do, or just one?
6522400	6523400	Just one.
6523400	6524400	How far down are they?
6524400	6525400	What?
6525400	6527400	You're on the wall. They're on the wall.
6527400	6528400	They're roughly...
6528400	6531400	Oh, I have a double weapon.
6531400	6534400	I have two swords, and I go into...
6534400	6536400	What's the one where you spin around
6536400	6539400	and you do a crazy dazzling display kind of thing?
6539400	6541400	No, just double-attack where I spin and fucking just...
6541400	6542400	Rhythm gymnastics?
6543400	6545400	I...
6545400	6547400	My swords both have ribbons on the end of it,
6547400	6548400	so it's pretty cool.
6548400	6549400	I do little swirlies.
6549400	6551400	And it's like a tribute to Scooby-Doo
6551400	6552400	or some weird shit.
6552400	6553400	I'm like, well, that's weird.
6553400	6554400	Could be.
6554400	6556400	I attack with two swords.
6556400	6559400	Attacking with both swords,
6559400	6561400	you cut a devastating swath of...
6561400	6563400	Well, no, there's not actually that much stuff.
6563400	6565400	You would if there were more enemies,
6565400	6569400	but instead you spin like a whirling dervish,
6569400	6572400	slicing the robot with your wicked blades,
6572400	6574400	dealing...
6574400	6575400	Seven.
6577400	6579400	Twenty-one damage.
6579400	6580400	Yeah.
6583400	6584400	All right.
6584400	6587400	Now the robot operators of the Howitzers are dead.
6587400	6588400	You're on the ramparts.
6588400	6590400	Pretty safe for now.
6590400	6591400	I turn to the group and say,
6591400	6593400	guys, we only have four minutes left.
6593400	6595400	We gotta get this done.
6596400	6599400	But Bodhi and Jenna, whatever your character's names are,
6599400	6603400	it's time you did the perfect teamwork move.
6603400	6605400	The two of you, one of you will do one thing
6605400	6606400	and then the other does the other thing,
6606400	6609400	and then you defeat the whole thing.
6611400	6613400	No pressure. No pressure.
6613400	6616400	Well, even though I'm a pharmaceutical barbarian,
6616400	6619400	I picked up a couple of double shotguns.
6619400	6620400	Sure.
6620400	6622400	I shoot some fuckers in the head.
6622400	6623400	Okay.
6623400	6624400	All right.
6624400	6626400	Well, let's see.
6626400	6628400	You hear a terrible cracking sound
6628400	6632400	as the interior of the stronghold breaks apart,
6632400	6635400	and the shadowy, towering, colossus-like form
6635400	6639400	of Pauline Hensonbot emerges from the stronghold,
6639400	6642400	her eyes glowing and red,
6642400	6645400	with blood coming out of her whatever.
6647400	6649400	Yeah, it's great.
6649400	6652400	She's coming at you with crazy robot claws,
6652400	6655400	but you're shooting shotgun shells and slugs
6655400	6657400	all at her body parts?
6657400	6658400	Oh, yeah.
6658400	6660400	It's doing damage.
6660400	6661400	How much damage?
6661400	6663400	I'm about to say.
6664400	6666400	Because, yeah, math.
6666400	6667400	Twenty-two damage.
6667400	6669400	Yeah.
6670400	6671400	Way to go, Jenna.
6671400	6673400	I'll take it. I'll take it.
6673400	6675400	The shells impact her body.
6675400	6677400	It's great. You love it.
6678400	6680400	Filter.
6680400	6682400	Go purify that bitch.
6686400	6688400	I cast Flight on myself.
6688400	6689400	All right.
6689400	6692400	As I launch towards her with my staff
6692400	6694400	held out to stab her in the face.
6694400	6695400	Your what now?
6695400	6698400	My sand-punk stuff.
6698400	6700400	Oh, your staff. Okay, sorry.
6700400	6701400	All right.
6701400	6703400	And then as I do that, I say,
6703400	6705400	I don't like it.
6705400	6711400	That's the new flag.
6713400	6716400	That's the new duchenne on me.
6716400	6717400	All right.
6717400	6719400	I guess a wooden staff
6719400	6722400	breaks through the giant metal robot.
6722400	6725400	Because it's powered by not liking it.
6725400	6728400	I turn to the group and I say,
6728400	6730400	look, you guys, remember how I blinked earlier
6730400	6731400	and I set off an explosive?
6731400	6733400	Because I'm part cyborg.
6733400	6735400	What I didn't tell you guys is that
6735400	6737400	when I was made,
6737400	6739400	like when I put the cyborg stuff in me,
6739400	6743400	if I do a hard double wink,
6743400	6746400	I turn into a giant bomb.
6746400	6748400	And I'm just going to go
6748400	6750400	just take one for the team.
6750400	6751400	But we fought.
6751400	6753400	I was hoping that would be how that panned out.
6753400	6758400	Look, you're being combative and
6758400	6762400	that's not on me.
6763400	6765400	Jeff.
6765400	6768400	It's morph.
6768400	6771400	I'm sorry we fought.
6771400	6773400	It's okay.
6773400	6776400	I want to,
6776400	6780400	is this too contrived if I sing you?
6780400	6782400	You should sing a bridge.
6782400	6784400	If you sing me.
6784400	6785400	I'm a bard.
6785400	6786400	So if I sing,
6786400	6788400	if I could sing you to the
6788400	6790400	bullseye of Pauline Henson's.
6790400	6793400	And then I'll just blow her up.
6793400	6794400	Oh, good God.
6794400	6796400	I will launch you on the voice of...
6796400	6797400	Right.
6797400	6800400	Jenna's gone on record as a conscientious objector.
6800400	6802400	She doesn't approve of fighting fire with fire.
6802400	6804400	Use your bard powers.
6804400	6806400	Power me up with your song.
6806400	6807400	I'm not okay with this.
6807400	6809400	I'm just going to point it at now.
6816400	6818400	I start running in slow motion.
6820400	6823400	You see the music bars come out of his mouth
6823400	6825400	and become manifest.
6825400	6827400	I get on them like a magic carpet
6827400	6830400	and I'm writing these music notes
6830400	6832400	and then staff lines.
6835400	6838400	Aim your notes towards her butt.
6841400	6844400	I'm flying up towards...
6844400	6845400	Tell us.
6845400	6847400	80 meters.
6847400	6851400	I'm flying up towards her butt cheeks.
6851400	6853400	And right in the hole,
6853400	6854400	right in the hole,
6854400	6856400	Phil Tor broke with a stick.
6856400	6858400	And I put my hands together like this
6858400	6860400	and I'm just trying to wedge through.
6860400	6862400	And I scream and I look back at the group
6862400	6864400	and I wave goodbye.
6864400	6866400	Can you stop describing it
6866400	6868400	and just do it already?
6868400	6872400	I put a pin in that passive aggressive shit.
6878400	6880400	And I look out towards the hole
6880400	6882400	that Phil Tor made
6882400	6884400	and with one...
6884400	6886400	I open up my eyes
6886400	6888400	and as I close my eyes,
6888400	6891400	I scream, Get Jeffed!
6894400	6896400	Everything explodes!
6896400	6899400	Australia is saved!
6899400	6903400	Wait, get the final description of it from Sensara.
6905400	6906400	Oh no!
6906400	6908400	What does it look like?
6908400	6910400	We see his feet just waving
6910400	6912400	outside the hole of the butt.
6912400	6914400	And suddenly there is just
6914400	6917400	an explosion of red blood and gore
6917400	6919400	and oil and circuitry.
6919400	6920400	Nice.
6920400	6922400	Let's hear it for everybody!
6924400	6925400	Thank you so much.
6925400	6927400	You guys are awesome.
6927400	6930400	Let's hear it for Jenna Bodie.
6930400	6937400	Also, it's Sensara, Jackson, Claire,
6937400	6939400	Owen, Alice.
6941400	6944400	The great people at Wheeler Center
6944400	6946400	and the Comedy Theater.
6946400	6949400	Let's hear it for Dan's Baby Kicky Dance.
6953400	6955400	Spencer Clinton, everybody.
6955400	6959400	I'm your Comptroller, Jeff Davis.
6959400	6962400	Your mayor, once again, is Dan Harmon.
6965400	6967400	Melbourne!
6967400	6971400	M-E-L-B-O-U-R-N-E, for me!
6971400	6972400	You're allowed to go.
6972400	6974400	You don't have to stick around for this.
6974400	6975400	For you and me!
6975400	6978400	Melbourne, as far as you see,
6978400	6982400	you're on the underside of the antipodee.
6982400	6984400	Melbourne!
6985400	6986400	No.
6986400	6987400	Try fast, take chances.
6987400	6988400	Thank you so much.
6988400	6990400	We'll see you at the boozer.
7009400	7010400	Did you get any of that?
7011400	7013400	It's a good show.
7015400	7016400	Thank you.
7017400	7019400	Cheryl Adeo.
