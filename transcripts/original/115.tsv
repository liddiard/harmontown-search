38000	40000	Pleasure to have you here.
40000	41000	Thank you for having me.
41000	42000	All right.
42000	43000	Thank you for the sugar cube song.
43000	44000	Yeah.
44000	45000	Yeah.
45000	47000	We were just talking about the sugar cube.
47000	49000	That's why you didn't want me to know what you were playing.
49000	50000	It was a little surprise.
50000	51000	Yeah.
51000	52000	It's very nice.
52000	54000	A very intimate friend.
54000	55000	Yeah.
55000	56000	It's a callback.
56000	57000	Yeah.
57000	58000	I have high hopes for you tonight.
58000	60000	I think you're going to control very well.
60000	63000	I'm feeling nervous right now, but I appreciate it.
63000	66000	What's the worst thing that you think you might do?
66000	68000	Say something that I think is going to be funny
68000	70000	and that it's not funny.
70000	73000	Say the funniest thing you could think of right now.
73000	77000	Let's just live through the nightmare.
77000	79000	What's the funniest thing about pickles
79000	82000	that you could even think of?
82000	83000	Oh, my God.
83000	85000	Well, now I have to add a little something?
85000	88000	I'll do a reverse improvise knock, knock joke.
88000	90000	Who's there?
90000	92000	Knock, knock.
92000	93000	Who's there, God damn it?
93000	96000	It better be pickle.
96000	99000	I've been waiting for a pickle.
99000	101000	Who's there?
101000	104000	It's a stork.
104000	105000	The stork from the pickle?
105000	108000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
108000	109000	Yeah.
109000	112000	Well, why are you here at my door?
112000	113000	Who are you?
113000	116000	The stork who?
116000	117000	I don't know.
117000	118000	Vlasic?
118000	119000	Mr. Vlasic?
119000	120000	Is that his name?
120000	121000	All right.
121000	122000	Well, come on in.
122000	123000	Come in.
123000	124000	All right.
124000	125000	How are you?
125000	126000	I'm great.
126000	127000	I ordered pickles.
127000	128000	I didn't know the stork would come.
128000	129000	Yeah, man.
129000	130000	Sit down.
130000	131000	Sit down.
131000	132000	Thanks.
132000	133000	I was just watching The Wire.
133000	135000	What's it about?
135000	138000	Crying.
138000	140000	Not pickles or babies.
140000	141000	Yeah.
141000	142000	I don't know if that's a stereotype.
142000	145000	We sell pickles on corners where I come from.
145000	146000	Oh, OK.
146000	148000	So you're familiar with the concept of controlling a corner, owning a corner?
148000	149000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
149000	150000	Yeah, these guys do that in The Wire.
150000	151000	Yeah, yeah, OK.
151000	152000	Yeah, OK.
152000	153000	All right.
153000	154000	Let's keep watching.
154000	155000	Six hours later.
155000	156000	I don't know.
156000	160000	Why are they focusing on the stevedores so much this season?
160000	161000	Yeah.
161000	164000	I miss Stringert Bell.
164000	169000	I guess they're trying to prove what is obviously the case, which is they're very good writers
169000	171000	and they're not drug dealer dependent.
172000	173000	Four hours later.
173000	175000	Fucking Stringert Bell's back.
175000	176000	Yeah.
176000	179000	They caved.
181000	182000	Five hours later.
182000	184000	That was a good finale.
184000	187000	I'm going to try to emulate that for season three of Community.
187000	188000	A year and a half later.
188000	191000	Fuck.
191000	192000	Shit.
192000	193000	Fuck.
193000	197000	Why is it trying to emulate The Wire on a sitcom?
197000	198000	All right.
198000	200000	So I got some bones to pick.
201000	202000	Yeah.
202000	203000	Oh, see, how did it feel?
203000	204000	You said something like...
204000	205000	Shaken, man.
205000	206000	But now you know nothing can harm you.
206000	207000	Yeah.
207000	208000	Listen to these guys.
208000	209000	You'll do the heavy lifting.
209000	210000	You're eating out of your...
210000	213000	I got some bones to pick.
213000	214000	Oh, hi, Enzy.
214000	215000	Oh, Enzy's back.
215000	216000	What's your birthday?
216000	217000	What?
217000	218000	It's Enzy's birthday?
218000	221000	Oh, well, we'll do something special for Enzy's birthday.
221000	227000	I hope you wanted for your birthday me picking pop cultural bones.
227000	229000	That's the name of our segment.
230000	233000	Ryan doesn't have an iPad or anything.
233000	234000	So there's no...
234000	235000	I can't improvise jingles.
235000	236000	I told you that.
236000	240000	I want your girlfriend to come and play violin for the segment.
240000	242000	She didn't bring her violin.
242000	243000	Ryan's girlfriend's a violinist.
243000	244000	Yeah.
244000	246000	She's like an accomplished violinist.
246000	249000	Like, she's like third, fourth chair.
249000	253000	And it goes by Defcon, so that's better than first chair.
253000	255000	First chair, violin, you're in trouble.
255000	257000	It means war is about to happen.
257000	258000	You don't want to be that.
258000	260000	Fourth chair is good.
260000	262000	They still call it a fiddle at fourth chair.
262000	267000	And then it becomes slowly work your way to a violin.
267000	270000	And then you jump forward to the timpani.
270000	275000	I went to a guy, I went to a Ben Folds, who's at the Hollywood Bowl,
275000	277000	and that's why he works really well with these orchestras and stuff.
277000	280000	And there's this guy, I mean, I really want to talk about the...
280000	281000	Guy, it goes like that.
281000	284000	Yeah, the 30 questions I have for the symbol guy.
284000	286000	I was watching him all night because I was like,
286000	289000	man, is he...
289000	292000	I'm sure your girlfriend probably could answer these questions.
292000	293000	She's probably been involved in...
293000	294000	She's right there, by the way.
294000	295000	Yeah, yeah.
295000	296000	Well, I don't like to look at her.
296000	301000	And I'm very uncomfortable around women and musicians,
301000	304000	so she's double trouble for me.
304000	310000	Mia, are you capable of answering questions in front of a crowd about...
310000	311000	Oh, okay, okay.
311000	312000	No, no, okay.
312000	314000	All right, I won't put you in a spot then.
314000	318000	But it's like the guy, he sits in back, and then I was just watching him,
318000	320000	and he sits there in silence for a while.
320000	322000	He's reading the music along with it, and he's like,
322000	325000	yeah, no cymbals on this page.
325000	328000	And then he turns the page, and then you see him start to...
328000	330000	He gets up, super professional.
330000	334000	I mean, he's in the L.A. Phil harmonic, but he just plays the cymbals.
334000	339000	So it's like, when he goes home, is he like a massive drummer?
339000	344000	And he's like, well, fucking the L.A. Phil is, you know, hard to get into,
344000	350000	so I'm honored to play just one part of the drum kit for such a prestigious band.
350000	354000	But come see me tonight with Fuckface at Spaceland,
354000	357000	and I will shred those fucking skins, man.
357000	364000	And he's just sitting there like, I hope my fucking conductor's in the audience.
364000	367000	And then he like, the night that his conductor comes,
367000	370000	he like does a whole fucking drum fill, like...
370000	376000	And then he hovers his stick over a cymbal, and then he drops it.
376000	381000	And he goes like, there's more to it than that, Mike.
381000	385000	And Mike's like, I just conduct, I don't write the fucking...
385000	387000	What, do you want a cymbal symphony?
387000	390000	You want me to write like a concerto for a cymbal?
390000	396000	Shh, shh, shh, shh...
396000	398000	It's the Overture.
398000	399000	All right.
399000	405000	Thank you for clapping, the President of the Lost Cause Department.
405000	408000	All right, so here's my bone I wanted to pick.
408000	413000	All right, so I think that enough time has passed now to talk about this,
413000	417000	and I don't think I'm gonna talk about it insensitivity.
417000	418000	Uh-oh.
418000	421000	No.
421000	424000	The...
424000	429000	Don't you think it was a little weird, I think thoughtful but weird,
429000	434000	when Princess Diana died and Elton John just said,
434000	438000	oh, this song's about her too.
438000	442000	His Marilyn Monroe song, that's like literally in the song,
442000	447000	he's like, your name was Norma Jean and you changed it to Marilyn Monroe
447000	450000	and this is a song about you.
450000	452000	And then Princess Diana died and he's like,
452000	456000	also Princess Diana, you were also a candle in the wind.
456000	459000	It's not, we didn't start the fire.
459000	460000	That covers everything.
460000	461000	Yeah, he did well.
461000	463000	See, Billy Joel did.
463000	465000	Yeah, he thought ahead.
465000	468000	Yeah, but he probably didn't like Princess Di.
468000	472000	He was probably like, good.
472000	473000	She did start the fire.
473000	475000	I'm just gonna add her death to my next song.
476000	479000	Nuclear war and Mario Kart and Princess Diana.
483000	485000	He's just like, fucking, I'm just gonna make some history about me.
485000	486000	I'm Billy Joel.
486000	489000	But Elton John, I don't know, was that a cool move to be like,
489000	492000	also, it's also about you.
492000	498000	And also, the song itself, even when it was just about Marilyn Monroe,
498000	500000	this isn't a rhetorical question.
500000	502000	Just like, if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
502000	505000	Isn't it kind of a dick move to have your whole song be like,
505000	508000	he's like, I didn't know you.
508000	510000	I was too young.
512000	513000	You're old and you're dead.
513000	520000	And then also, like, your candle blew out long before your legend ever did.
520000	522000	Well, of course, what the fuck are you talking about?
522000	524000	Why is that even a remarkable thing to say?
524000	526000	Also, it's kind of rubbing your face.
526000	530000	Like, you're a corpse now, but people heard of you.
531000	533000	Wow.
533000	536000	Like, you have that in common with Attila the Hun?
537000	539000	I'm sure Marilyn Monroe's zombie would be like,
539000	541000	yeah, but I'd rather be alive.
541000	544000	I'd rather my candle not have burnt out.
544000	545000	Like, who are you?
545000	546000	I don't know you.
546000	547000	I'm too young.
547000	549000	Who, who, who, the bitch is back?
550000	552000	He's not even that young.
552000	555000	He's like, I think it was just a song about how he's just like,
555000	557000	look how young I was.
557000	559000	I was just a kid when Marilyn Monroe died.
559000	561000	Don't brag about that.
562000	564000	And then Princess Di dies and he's like, guess what?
564000	566000	Do, do, do, write a new song.
567000	568000	All right.
568000	570000	Obviously, you guys disagree or are 25.
572000	573000	Fine.
573000	574000	I really thought.
574000	576000	Remember when I said I got something juicy to talk about?
576000	577000	I could wait.
577000	579000	How sad is it that that was it?
581000	584000	I'm not going to tell you because I want your real reactions.
584000	585000	You're just, you're just sitting there.
585000	586000	That's just fine.
587000	589000	I don't want you to start thinking you have a job.
589000	590000	Like, am I supposed to be talking more?
590000	591000	Yeah, you keep looking at me.
591000	592000	No, no, no, I just.
592000	593000	Should I?
593000	595000	Um, no, that's probably no.
595000	597000	No, that's what happened.
597000	598000	Did somebody just vape?
598000	600000	Well, there was a puff of smoke that went up.
600000	602000	Oh, maybe something started on fire.
602000	603000	Sorry.
604000	605000	Uh, okay.
605000	609000	So, uh, these are all secondary to that topic.
609000	611000	These are all, these are all less interesting.
611000	613000	I think I'm going to like this one better.
614000	616000	I got picked up from the airport once.
625000	626000	The job should be sarcastic.
627000	628000	I get it.
628000	629000	You don't know who Elton John is.
629000	632000	Maybe, maybe you guys should write a song about it.
632000	634000	Goodbye, Elton John.
634000	638000	We were too young to know who you were too young to be singing about.
638000	642000	When you sang about being too young to know somebody that died.
642000	647000	It seems to me you lived your life making one song about multiple people.
647000	652000	Never knowing which dead person to ride the coattails of.
653000	658000	I would have liked to be mad about it, but I was just a kid when you were irrelevant.
661000	666000	That song was already annoying before everyone else died that you made it about.
666000	669000	All right, so I got picked up from the airport.
669000	676000	And, uh, and I always ask a driver, so I like to make small talk.
676000	678000	And I know what the drivers like to talk about.
678000	684000	I always ask him who's the most famous person or just name it like who's not even the most famous person.
684000	687000	Just tell me somebody that stuck out that drove in your car.
687000	691000	You know, it's like a car guy, you know, they drive people.
691000	692000	They're in a life.
692000	693000	Definitely.
693000	696000	Sometimes you hear, oh, Alan Aldo was a really nice guy.
696000	699000	Bruce Willis was mean to me or something like that.
699000	700000	It's kind of fun.
700000	705000	This guy said, he said, well, I picked up a guy named D.L. Hughley.
705000	706000	You know him.
706000	708000	And I said, I've heard of D.L. Hughley.
708000	709000	I know who that is.
709000	713000	And he said, yeah, he wanted the red door service.
713000	714000	Uh-oh.
714000	717000	And I was like, what's red door service?
717000	725000	He's like, yeah, you know, there's, if you're famous, there's a red door at LAX you can be taken to.
727000	729000	It's like a VIP door.
729000	733000	I guess that's why you never see Harrison Ford like getting frisked at the airport.
733000	735000	He doesn't just have a private jet.
735000	737000	I saw Frank Langella once.
739000	741000	He's like purple door.
743000	745000	But like, I guess there's a red door.
745000	746000	I don't know.
746000	748000	Well, did he tell you more about it?
748000	750000	What does it look like?
752000	755000	He said, I pulled him up to a thing and it was like a red door.
755000	757000	It was red?
757000	758000	Yes.
758000	759000	Okay.
759000	761000	I don't remember that part of the conversation.
761000	764000	I just want to know, you know, what's up with the red door.
764000	766000	I told you it was worse than the thing.
766000	767000	All right.
767000	769000	So, yeah.
769000	775000	I had a barbecue today saying goodbye to my assistant, Daniella, who's moving on to be a mother.
777000	779000	Yeah, you know what I said.
779000	781000	You're the new assistant?
781000	783000	No, I already hired a new assistant.
783000	784000	I'm sorry.
784000	787000	I mean, I get to pick a creme de la creme, man.
787000	791000	I'm talking to people like, yeah, I used to roll joints for so-and-so.
791000	792000	I'm like, okay.
792000	795000	I took Renny Harlan's dog to the vet.
796000	797000	I'm like, yeah?
797000	799000	Well, what have you done for me lately?
800000	803000	Yeah, I'm picking from the pros.
803000	804000	Okay.
804000	806000	So, not that you, sir, are not.
807000	812000	And not that the assistant, Renny Harlan, would make you better.
815000	817000	So, I had a goodbye party for her.
817000	818000	Yeah.
818000	819000	And there were balloons.
819000	821000	We got a tank of helium.
821000	822000	Ooh.
824000	826000	I can see where this is going.
826000	828000	And I saw this big helium tank.
828000	830000	It looks exactly like a propane tank.
830000	832000	And Aaron was like, can you put that over there?
832000	835000	And I was like, fuck, man, my back.
835000	837000	This is going to be a bummer.
837000	839000	And I went and picked it up.
839000	841000	Tanks of helium are very light.
844000	848000	It's like a metal tank filled with something lighter than air.
849000	852000	And I was like, I was so overjoyed by that.
853000	854000	This is like a joke.
854000	855000	It's like a cartoon.
855000	856000	The tank is light.
856000	860000	Does it technically make it lighter than the tank if it was empty?
860000	861000	I don't know.
861000	863000	I would think so because it's lighter than air.
863000	864000	Wow.
864000	865000	That's why balloons float.
865000	866000	Yeah, it's lighter than air.
866000	867000	Right.
867000	871000	If you put enough helium into, I guess, a thin enough tank,
872000	873000	you could fly.
875000	877000	It's a dirigible, right?
877000	878000	Yeah.
880000	882000	Tanks of helium are lighter.
883000	886000	You guys should have been more into the candle and wind stuff.
886000	888000	What's in a blimp?
888000	890000	I could have done it 30 minutes on it.
890000	893000	But I had a sandbar with you and I moved on.
893000	894000	I moved on to shit.
894000	895000	You deserved it.
896000	898000	What's in a blimp?
898000	899000	What's in a blimp?
899000	900000	Hydrogen?
901000	902000	Hydrogen?
902000	903000	Helium?
903000	904000	Really?
904000	905000	Well, now helium.
905000	909000	But hydrogen, when it blew up, oh, the humanity one, Hindenburg.
910000	913000	You know a lot of people survive the Hindenburg because they just jumped off?
913000	914000	Yeah.
914000	915000	It was close enough for the ground?
915000	916000	It wasn't that high up.
916000	917000	Yeah, I'm sure they were like, fuck me.
917000	918000	And now so many people died either.
918000	919000	Yeah.
919000	920000	How many people?
920000	921000	The guy was being a drama queen.
921000	922000	Oh, the humanity?
922000	923000	Yeah.
923000	925000	Literally, like 16 people died.
926000	927000	Well, he doesn't know.
927000	928000	I guess you're sensitive then.
928000	930000	He should have said, oh, the blimpery.
931000	933000	Oh, the overhead.
934000	937000	Oh, the insurance paperwork.
938000	942000	This is going to be a week of tough work down at Lloyd's of London.
944000	948000	I mean, the thing that everybody fantasizes about with the plane crash,
948000	950000	people actually did on the Hindenburg.
950000	951000	Like, I can just jump off.
951000	952000	Yeah.
952000	953000	Yeah.
953000	954000	Yeah.
954000	955000	They hurt themselves.
955000	958000	But those 16 people were probably like kind of cooler, more confident people.
959000	965000	They looked up and saw an entire blimp burning up the entire thing.
965000	968000	And they were like, you know, they wouldn't let us on this thing if they didn't know
968000	969000	what they were doing.
972000	973000	I'm going to hang out.
975000	977000	That's the part of the blimp that no one uses.
977000	978000	It's a bunch of hydrogen.
981000	983000	I'm going to, you know, people panic too much.
984000	985000	Those are the 16 people.
985000	987000	The other people were like, it's 50 feet.
987000	988000	I can make it.
989000	990000	Yeah.
991000	992000	Yeah.
992000	995000	So, Ryan is half Irish, half Jewish.
996000	998000	I'm not half Irish, first of all.
999000	1001000	But I'm half not Jewish, is what you're trying to say.
1002000	1003000	So, what's the half that's not Jewish?
1003000	1004000	Is that Irish?
1004000	1009000	No, it's English, German, other stuff that's close to Irish.
1009000	1011000	But your name is Ridley.
1012000	1013000	Oh, I'm Ryan Ridley.
1014000	1016000	I suppose you'd like a taste of me magic.
1017000	1018000	Popcorn.
1019000	1022000	If I was half Irish, then I wouldn't focus on the Jewish part so much.
1023000	1023000	
1023000	1025000	Because Irish competes with that identity.
1025000	1026000	Right, it kind of evens you out.
1026000	1027000	Yeah.
1027000	1028000	I'm nothing.
1028000	1031000	I'm like a bunch of random other European.
1031000	1032000	Yeah.
1032000	1032000	
1032000	1033000	Well, that kind of kills my ass.
1035000	1036000	I was thinking.
1036000	1037000	You're not.
1037000	1039000	I mean, you're bit that you told me you're not Irish, right?
1039000	1042000	I'm like half Irish.
1043000	1045000	Half Polish, half Cherokee.
1046000	1050000	For the point of your bit, you can do Jewish and boyum.
1051000	1054000	It was kind of my bit was a bit, like the idea that it was a bit was a bit.
1055000	1059000	But we could realize you're a nightmare of doing a bad bit.
1060000	1062000	Well, it sounds like I don't have to do anything.
1062000	1066000	Ryan is half Jewish, half Irish.
1067000	1070000	To the extent that that's true, I'm fully Irish.
1071000	1075000	And and then we have our friend Dave Horowitz, who I think is full blown.
1075000	1076000	Oh, yeah, absolutely.
1076000	1078000	Like tilt, full tilt.
1078000	1079000	Yeah.
1079000	1082000	Like actually seven, seven points on his Star of David.
1086000	1089000	There's just an extra one there for just just for safety.
1091000	1094000	And I thought the joke would be this is the hackiest.
1095000	1100000	That you that we would have him stand on one side and me stand on the other.
1100000	1104000	And we would get questions or hit you with scenarios.
1104000	1106000	And then we would give you advice from each side.
1106000	1107000	Yeah.
1108000	1109000	It doesn't.
1109000	1112000	It's like once you explain that bit, it's over.
1113000	1117000	Doing it isn't it doesn't it doesn't really work.
1117000	1118000	I mean, that depends on you guys.
1118000	1119000	Yeah.
1119000	1120000	You come up with really funny answers.
1120000	1122000	Like let's just do the most obvious.
1122000	1124000	Like Dave Horowitz, can you come up?
1125000	1126000	Are you here?
1126000	1126000	
1126000	1127000	Oh, okay.
1127000	1128000	All right.
1133000	1134000	A full Jew.
1134000	1135000	Yeah.
1135000	1136000	Full Jew.
1136000	1137000	One hundred percent.
1137000	1138000	Yeah.
1138000	1139000	Yeah.
1139000	1140000	So yeah.
1140000	1145000	Give us what's your curriculum vitae like how Jewish like like just prove you're like
1145000	1148000	what do you you're not just you're really Jewish.
1149000	1151000	I mean, I'd say like
1152000	1155000	maybe like not religiously which is what all Jews say.
1155000	1156000	So right there.
1156000	1157000	Yeah.
1157000	1158000	You're Jewish now.
1158000	1160000	I talk with my hands exclusively.
1160000	1162000	So very could be Italian.
1162000	1163000	Yeah.
1163000	1164000	Well TV writer.
1164000	1165000	Right.
1165000	1166000	Okay.
1166000	1167000	That tilted over.
1167000	1168000	Really.
1168000	1169000	There are no Italian TV writers.
1169000	1174000	Also you can't see but like I'd say like the most Jewish is from nose to like this is the
1174000	1175000	most Jewish.
1175000	1178000	Have you ever seen a more Jewish thing than this nose and these eyebrows.
1178000	1180000	It's a very bad podcast bit.
1180000	1181000	But right.
1181000	1183000	Google Google image search me right now.
1183000	1184000	And you'll see.
1184000	1187000	He's pointing at like he's very he's got Eugene Levy eyebrows.
1187000	1188000	Yeah.
1188000	1191000	But like but you pull it off.
1191000	1192000	You're a handsome man.
1192000	1196000	But like if Eugene Levy it was in like maybe like a band.
1196000	1198000	You know what I mean.
1198000	1199000	It's Silver Lake.
1199000	1200000	Yeah.
1200000	1201000	Yeah.
1201000	1204000	And they were doing kind of well like you know maybe like they were being scouted.
1204000	1210000	They weren't signed but like an indie label was maybe interested in Eugene Levy's band.
1211000	1212000	All right.
1212000	1214000	So let's just try this hack bit.
1214000	1215000	Okay.
1215000	1216000	So right.
1216000	1217000	So Ryan.
1217000	1218000	Someone.
1218000	1219000	Someone.
1219000	1220000	Someone asked.
1220000	1221000	Wait.
1221000	1222000	How does it work.
1222000	1223000	Can we.
1223000	1224000	Someone.
1224000	1225000	Someone.
1225000	1226000	Someone.
1226000	1227000	Someone.
1227000	1230000	Someone name a situation for.
1230000	1232000	For Ryan.
1232000	1233000	Yeah.
1233000	1234000	A topic.
1234000	1235000	A topic.
1235000	1236000	Condoms.
1236000	1237000	Condoms.
1237000	1238000	Okay.
1238000	1239000	Condoms.
1239000	1240000	All right.
1240000	1241000	So Ryan.
1241000	1242000	The topic is condoms.
1242000	1243000	All right.
1243000	1244000	I got it.
1244000	1245000	I got it.
1245000	1246000	All right.
1246000	1247000	Listen.
1247000	1253000	I am I'm at my place with a woman just brought her home don't know her matter.
1253000	1254000	What.
1254000	1255000	Yeah.
1255000	1256000	Listen.
1256000	1257000	Trust me.
1257000	1258000	Yeah.
1258000	1259000	Wait.
1259000	1261000	How did it go down.
1261000	1262000	Hold on.
1262000	1263000	What did you say.
1263000	1265000	What did you say to her to get her back to your place.
1265000	1266000	What.
1266000	1267000	Game one of them.
1267000	1268000	Well I mean what would it.
1268000	1269000	A Jewish person say.
1269000	1270000	Did you write her a poem.
1270000	1271000	I hate it.
1271000	1272000	Why don't I just.
1272000	1273000	It's the worst bit ever.
1273000	1274000	It's just the worst.
1274000	1275000	I'm kind of enjoying how bad it is.
1275000	1276000	I've got a real question.
1276000	1280000	A Jewish person might say like hey I have that Woody Allen PBS documentary DVR if you
1280000	1282000	want to watch the first part of it.
1282000	1285000	Maybe we'll get to the second part unless we get distracted.
1285000	1286000	And then you do that.
1286000	1287000	Man.
1288000	1289000	The first part is like two hours.
1289000	1290000	Yeah.
1290000	1291000	You've got to ease into it.
1291000	1293000	You've got to wait until the first hour is over to put your arm over.
1293000	1296000	And if I was Irish what should I do to take home some bar skis.
1296000	1299000	I guess just the scenario.
1299000	1302000	She can be a nice girl.
1302000	1303000	I'm not.
1303000	1304000	I'm not.
1304000	1305000	I'm not.
1305000	1306000	I'm not.
1306000	1307000	I'm not.
1307000	1308000	I'm not.
1308000	1309000	I'm not.
1309000	1310000	I'm not.
1310000	1311000	I'm not.
1311000	1312000	I'm not.
1312000	1313000	I'm not.
1313000	1314000	I'm not.
1314000	1315000	I'm not.
1315000	1316000	I'm not.
1317000	1318000	That's what you say.
1318000	1319000	She's an Irish guy.
1319000	1324000	She can be a nice girl Ryan.
1324000	1338000	I think you should just take her down to the ocean and watch it not compromise.
1338000	1341000	Rub two lumps of coal together.
1342000	1348000	To symbolize the unmitigated freedom.
1348000	1350000	Should I use a condom?
1350000	1352000	I guess it's the.
1352000	1353000	No.
1353000	1359000	You've got to make more Irish children to.
1359000	1363000	A Jewish person would tell you to wear like the tight like wear two.
1363000	1364000	Yeah.
1364000	1365000	And have her wear one.
1365000	1366000	The only diseases there are.
1366000	1369000	Have her be in another room when you're having sex.
1369000	1372000	You can never be too safe honey.
1372000	1373000	What?
1373000	1375000	I'm definitely more Jewish.
1375000	1376000	Yeah.
1376000	1377000	Well you do.
1377000	1380000	I was with you when you when you jude out.
1380000	1381000	You.
1381000	1382000	Yeah.
1382000	1385000	I want an acceptable phrase.
1385000	1388000	What else could you call it?
1388000	1393680	I was I used to talk to when we were back in the early 2000s like when you you were like
1393680	1398320	I started to watch you start to become increasingly Jewish like it was like you were you were like
1398320	1400320	Eric Stoltz on the fly too.
1400320	1401320	Yeah.
1401320	1406320	You were a normal kid and then you were like you started climbing the walls a little bit.
1406320	1408320	Wait how did the transformation start.
1408320	1412320	I think you just started going to shul a lot.
1412320	1413320	Yeah.
1413320	1414320	True.
1414320	1415320	And.
1415320	1416320	Yeah.
1416320	1417320	Yeah.
1417320	1424320	And I was always fascinated with mythology and you know Judeo-Christian mythology in particular.
1425320	1427320	We had a lot of interesting provocative conversations.
1427320	1428320	Yeah.
1428320	1434320	You know whether the sequel holds up and stuff.
1434320	1440320	And then you and then you're like I'm going to Israel and I'm like.
1440320	1443320	See you when you get back.
1443320	1444320	You didn't like that.
1444320	1447320	It's like going to the Disneyland mythology.
1447320	1448320	I.
1448320	1452320	I rode the rides man.
1452320	1460320	You have to be this high to wail at this wall.
1460320	1461320	The.
1461320	1462320	Yeah.
1462320	1463320	I don't know.
1463320	1464320	Well I was just losing a friend.
1464320	1465320	I don't know.
1465320	1466320	I can't.
1466320	1467320	I can't do long distance relationships.
1467320	1470320	I'm not going to Skype with you with your little beard and your tassels or whatever.
1470320	1471320	You did.
1471320	1472320	I do.
1472320	1474320	Well as a bit like for a show I did.
1474320	1476320	I had you send a recording.
1476320	1479320	I pretended it was a Skype conversation in a video.
1479320	1480320	Yeah.
1480320	1481320	Yeah.
1482320	1483320	This is big.
1483320	1484320	He had a fight.
1484320	1485320	He looked like fucking.
1485320	1486320	It's amazing.
1486320	1488320	But like like it's it's like it.
1488320	1492320	I guess it is like a thing like like you could just like.
1492320	1494320	It just grows when you step off the plane.
1494320	1496320	Like when you get onto Israeli soil.
1496320	1501320	When you see like a like an Orthodox is that the right term an Orthodox Jew.
1501320	1504320	Like like walking in that neighborhood in L.A.
1504320	1509320	Like can you see the Indiana Jones hat and the like beard and the witness Amish suit.
1509320	1514320	You know the the the you always go like like wow that's such an alien weird thing.
1514320	1518320	But my friend went over to Israel and he just like he got on this Skype thing.
1518320	1523320	And it was like he looked like he wasn't doing a bit like it wasn't like a prop beer.
1523320	1528320	Like like that is just what anyone can look like if they spend enough time.
1528320	1533320	I had the beard was real and I think I threw on a jacket because I brought a suit.
1533320	1538320	But I mean I found that hat just laying around literally like I was like oh there's seven of them.
1538320	1540320	OK this one.
1540320	1542320	I don't I didn't have one.
1542320	1546320	Yeah.
1546320	1557320	I've never been to Israel but I'm pretty sure that they like pull some kind of weird like mystical voodoo on you to make like basically make you grow the beard.
1557320	1565320	Like my brother went on birthright which is like a free trip you can go on up to I think 26 and he wasn't religious at all.
1565320	1570320	And he called. I feel so bad for him because he got swindled because he's such a sweetheart.
1570320	1576320	But he called me. It was like 4 a.m. his time and he went.
1576320	1583320	David was like yeah and he goes it's the mother land.
1583320	1587320	And I was like what what's up buddy. He's like it's the mother land.
1587320	1590320	It's so beautiful. Like I bet it is. What happened.
1590320	1598320	And he's like I went to this store and this this woman told me that I reminded her of her son who was fighting in the Golan Heights.
1598320	1601320	I was like oh no you got swindled. How much money did you spend.
1601320	1607320	And she's like she gave me this pendant and she said it was his and she said I wanted I want you to have this.
1607320	1611320	And I was like how much how much. He's like it was three hundred and fifty dollars.
1611320	1613320	And I was like no.
1613320	1618320	Because you know that the second he left the store she just took another pendant and put it on the thing.
1618320	1629320	You remind me of my son. The truth is a lot of people there look like her son. Yeah.
1629320	1633320	And she just has a box of her son's stuff. She's not really swindling people. She's just like fuck.
1633320	1639320	If you see another guy. Never mind. But she's always charging three hundred fifty dollars.
1639320	1647320	This is my son's corn t-shirt. He would have wanted you to have it.
1647320	1656320	He would have wanted you to pay me three hundred fifty dollars to get 17 boxes of corn t-shirts printed on Cafe Press.
1656320	1662320	This episode of Harmontown is brought to you by Fulton and Roark. Jeff you're sick of spilling all your colognes all over the place.

1668320	1674320	I can't remember how many times I've walked in on you just just covered in sticky wet cologne.
1674320	1682320	I have traveled and broken a bottle of the cologne that I wear. And then my luggage smells like a French whorehouse for the rest of time.

1697320	1701320	You know I do mean that but I also mean physically solid as well.
1701320	1712320	Oh like a little like you're talking about a wax based cologne that travels in a little small package that I can't spill all over my luggage and smell like a Mexican tit house.

1803320	1807320	Different corporation by Fulton and Roark.
1807320	1810320	Yeah I think it's I think it's delightful.
1810320	1817320	I think I think I think I think wasps suffer from lack of mythology lack of rites of passage.
1817320	1824320	We have confirmation maybe kind of some a lot of kids out here probably had confirmation maybe if they were Catholic enough.
1825320	1832320	But but there's really some people got drunk and had to go hunt with their dads and kill a deer maybe.
1832320	1834320	I think that's probably a thing of the past.
1834320	1837320	Most of us gotten a fight with someone on prom night.
1837320	1846320	But but there's not like there's not enough of the not enough of the you know the apartments for these days are so pure the ritualistic.
1846320	1847320	Well that's another topic though.
1847320	1856320	It's like the secularization of of of the theology and Judaism like hasn't like made it less functional.
1856320	1866320	Like that's what I like as it as it as a Jew a file whatever the word is like I'm always jealous of the fact that it's like yeah they figured it out.
1866320	1871320	They got they got a religion where they believe in an entity that they can have one foot in one foot out.
1871320	1873320	They can get their shit done.
1873320	1875320	The focus is on community and family.
1875320	1879320	It's not it's not based on this McDonald's like hey fuck it.
1879320	1880320	Who said he wants one.
1880320	1881320	You can have one.
1881320	1883320	Here's your here's your Big Mac maker.
1883320	1885320	What the health department close you down here.
1885320	1888320	We don't know you.
1888320	1890320	Where there's there's no Vatican in Judaism.
1890320	1892320	There's no like it's not like Subway.
1892320	1900320	You know it's not like this is like Subway is also a great company.
1900320	1904320	That being able to shoot outdoors in season six may be totally reliant on.
1904320	1909320	So I didn't I didn't mean to I didn't mean to connect those dots.
1909320	1912320	Subway actually I think I think Subway would probably say it.
1912320	1915320	They wouldn't say this but they would.
1915320	1919320	Off record they might say no we function more like Judaism than Christianity because I don't.
1919320	1923320	I think the reason why Subway is able to be so game is that they actually are.
1923320	1926320	They're like a disbanded group of franchises.
1926320	1932320	Like there isn't like a central capital where where it's like I'm Mr. Subway and I'm angry.
1932320	1934320	I want to take over the world.
1934320	1938320	Who's not helping me.
1938320	1942320	Subway is more Jewish than Christian.
1942320	1946320	If you if you if you if there's 12 Subway employees in one place that's a minion.
1946320	1950320	You can make new rules for Subway.
1950320	1952320	I think that's really cool.
1952320	1960320	And you know when you if you bring a baby into Subway they will cut his little wiener and suck the blood with their mouths.
1960320	1963320	They might they might.
1963320	1968320	Is community like the cool Christian church that plays guitar.
1968320	1969320	Subway is cool.
1969320	1972320	Yeah we get it.
1972320	1980320	The pastor that like sits backwards and share like guys let me rap to you about a friend of mine named J.C.
1980320	1985320	Yeah like like well I guess OK that's the thing Judaism and Christianity have in common.
1985320	1988320	They always bury the lead.
1988320	1999320	It's all that no one can be genuinely proud like those Christian shows for kids that are like like like listen this show is called How to Rock for Jesus.
1999320	2002320	How to get your parents to do whatever you want.
2002320	2010320	I'm going to I'm going to tell you I know the guy who wrote the book on being radical Jesus.
2010320	2017320	Like they draw you in and it's like like 20 minutes into a into a 40 minute Kirk Cameron tape you're watching.
2017320	2026320	You know there's just called super dude and it's just like 20 minutes and it's like a crazy ass one 13 says man.
2026320	2032320	Yeah these girls came up to me at a mall when I was like 16 or like hey you want to go to a party night like you do.
2032320	2034320	I.
2034320	2036320	Turns out it was church.
2037320	2041320	That was the big thing in my neighborhood Brown Deer Wisconsin it was the lock ins.
2041320	2045320	We're having a lock in like the cutest girls in high school.
2045320	2051320	There's going to be a lock in like they didn't know that they were advertising this thing like they didn't.
2051320	2053320	It was just a natural organic thing that was happening.
2053320	2058320	It was like some studly dude with a guitar and long hair who then like all the girls have crushes on him.
2058320	2061320	He sends them out like why don't you guys go tell all your friends.
2061320	2064320	Let's let's fucking let's just hang out tomorrow.
2064320	2069320	We've got to lock the doors you know first you know just because you know.
2069320	2074320	Not not because anyone's going to want to leave once I reveal why we're actually there.
2074320	2080320	It's just so that it's just so that non rocking people can't get in after midnight.
2080320	2081320	This is high school.
2081320	2082320	Yeah.
2082320	2084320	It's like kids you went to school with their kids in the town or.
2084320	2091320	Yeah it's a small Midwestern town so there was a you know there was a lot of people that loved them some Jesus such a culty vibe.
2091320	2094320	It always I mean there was a church youth groups there everywhere.
2094320	2102320	I mean that's like like you there's I'm sure by applause how many people went through a through through a small Christian phase in their teenage years.
2102320	2104320	Like you don't see.
2104320	2105320	Whoa.
2105320	2108320	It's it's it's it's our shul it's our it's our Israel.
2108320	2115320	It's our is anyone going to a Christian phase now.
2115320	2117320	That's cool when you're an adult.
2117320	2118320	Wait I want to try one.
2118320	2126320	Has anyone been to a bar mitzvah where they had a blow up inflatable saxophones.
2126320	2131320	Inflatable saxophones is my religion.
2131320	2134320	How many Jews are in the audience.
2134320	2137320	Is your mother Jewish.
2137320	2138320	Oh.
2138320	2141320	More people clap that time than the who's Jewish.
2141320	2150320	So you explain to me the reason for the mother rule is of course because they're before paternity tests before modern society.
2150320	2159320	If you had to know the only way you could know for sure who you where you came from was the mother side.
2159320	2160320	Right.
2160320	2161320	Somebody told me.
2161320	2162320	Yeah.
2162320	2163320	Because there's a lot of Roman soldiers.
2163320	2167320	If you go if you go by paternal lineage you can start to fudge the books.
2167320	2171320	But it's hard to fake a birth.
2171320	2173320	So Jewishness goes by the mother's side.
2173320	2176320	If you're if you're half Jewish on your mom's side you're allowed to just go.
2176320	2179320	I'm totes Jewish.
2179320	2181320	Sorry about my dad getting in there.
2181320	2183320	But won't happen again.
2183320	2187320	I will carry this torch.
2187320	2189320	I will go on J day.
2189320	2194320	The Jewish mother versus Jewish father creates a real like school day schism.
2194320	2195320	Oh yeah.
2195320	2196320	Yeah.
2196320	2197320	Yeah.
2197320	2198320	She knows what I'm talking about.
2198320	2199320	That's true.
2199320	2200320	Wait what do you mean.
2200320	2201320	Spike Lee school days.
2201320	2202320	Yeah.
2202320	2203320	No we know that.
2203320	2204320	Let me explain something.
2204320	2205320	It's a movie that Spike Lee did.
2205320	2206320	What do you.
2206320	2207320	Why.
2207320	2208320	What's the controversy.
2208320	2209320	Is it just like.
2209320	2211320	She knows what I'm talking about.
2211320	2212320	Well why are you putting it off on her.
2212320	2213320	What do you.
2213320	2214320	You're right.
2214320	2217320	I guess I'm the one of the Mike.
2217320	2220320	The half Jews whose mother Jewish kind of has like.
2220320	2222320	Well I'm the real Jew.
2222320	2223320	You're not.
2223320	2225320	You're just a half Jew biologically.
2225320	2226320	I'm not saying it's good.
2226320	2227320	I'm not proud of it.
2227320	2230320	You're saying there are Jews who are born on their mom's side half Jews.
2230320	2231320	Yeah.
2231320	2232320	Oh so it's like.
2232320	2233320	Look down their nose at the ones whose dad.
2233320	2236320	Look down their prodigious noses.
2236320	2239320	Don't take this lightly.
2239320	2241320	I'm going to look down my nose.
2241320	2244320	It's taking me a long time to look down this nose.
2244320	2247320	So know that I mean it when I say it.
2247320	2253320	Mother fucker.
2253320	2254320	Oh man.
2254320	2257320	Dave Horowitz was looking down his nose at me the other day.
2257320	2258320	It took forever.
2258320	2259320	Exhausting.
2259320	2263320	He had to take a break halfway through.
2263320	2268320	A glass of water.
2268320	2269320	That nose thing.
2269320	2270320	I guess I've seen.
2270320	2271320	I guess I know it.
2271320	2273320	I guess I guess I've seen the nose thing.
2273320	2274320	Yeah you're looking at it.
2274320	2276320	You're kind of a big nose.
2276320	2277320	No you don't.
2277320	2278320	Not at all.
2278320	2279320	Not even close.
2279320	2281320	You have Eugene Levy eyebrows.
2281320	2282320	You don't have.
2282320	2283320	But like we agreed.
2283320	2285320	The cooler version.
2285320	2286320	The cooler version.
2286320	2287320	Oh yeah.
2287320	2288320	No the hip.
2288320	2289320	Yeah.
2289320	2290320	Yeah.
2290320	2291320	But that's crazy.
2291320	2294320	You have body dysmorphia if you think your nose is unusual.
2294320	2298320	I'm just saying that Eugene Levy I am would like want you to call him Gene.
2298320	2300320	You know what I'm saying?
2300320	2301320	That's all.
2301320	2302320	That's all.
2302320	2303320	That's all.
2303320	2307320	Maybe it's my I have like you know kind of face blindness self-diagnosed aloofness.
2307320	2310320	So maybe I just don't see noses.
2311320	2312320	How can you miss it.
2312320	2322320	I I embarrassingly was unaware of what a minority I was in as a Jew because the town I grew
2322320	2329320	up in is small and it was it's at this point like 74 percent Jewish more temples and churches.
2329320	2335320	And I got to school and like college and nobody like everyone I talked to was like you're
2335320	2338320	like and they would they thought for a half a second.
2338320	2340320	You're like the third Jewish person.
2340320	2341320	No no no.
2341320	2342320	That guy was the second.
2342320	2344320	I think you're the second Jewish person I've ever talked to.
2344320	2346320	And I couldn't believe it.
2346320	2351320	And and I experienced such like mild anti-Semitism because we'd just be like a kid on my floor
2351320	2355320	who was super drunk would be like so you're Jewish.
2355320	2356320	I'm like huh.
2356320	2364320	So you don't like Christmas is like not like it's like do you don't do.
2364320	2365320	I'm like no we don't.
2365320	2366320	I don't.
2366320	2367320	My family doesn't do it.
2367320	2369320	It's like well that fucking sucks.
2369320	2374320	Yeah they're just like well because they grew up in the same same scenario you did except
2374320	2376320	the other way around.
2376320	2377320	I was like I don't know.
2377320	2379320	I guess there might have been some Jewish kids around.
2379320	2380320	I just like it wasn't introduced.
2380320	2385320	I wasn't indoctrinated into it until like it slowly trickles into your awareness because
2385320	2387320	you're just talking about a bunch of white people.
2387320	2393320	Like it's it's it's a lot easier to get indoctrinated into racism on the grade school playground.
2393320	2398320	And then and then and then it's more of a like high school college thing like you slowly
2398320	2400320	hear this weird word that doesn't mean anything.
2400320	2404320	And then you and then you go to college and you meet someone and you go like OK so what's
2404320	2408320	then you ask him a bunch of weird questions the way that you might ask a black person
2408320	2412320	weird questions if you hadn't been if you didn't grow up around them you would which
2412320	2419320	would be mildly racist because of your strange misdirected like seeking of truth and well
2419320	2420320	rounded.
2420320	2424320	But then and then also you just observe like oh not everyone's last name ends in like wits
2424320	2427320	or Stein or like a gold or burr.
2427320	2428320	There's a lot of shit to get straight.
2428320	2432320	I mean that's a lot more Smith's outside of Sharon Massachusetts.
2432320	2434320	More Jews.
2434320	2436320	All right.
2436320	2437320	Hey Dan.
2437320	2438320	Yeah.
2438320	2439320	Can I have some more vodka.
2439320	2441320	Yeah.
2441320	2446320	But I don't usually serve it but you're doing great.
2446320	2447320	Way to go Ryan.
2447320	2454320	Ryan Ridley.
2454320	2456320	Hey Andy.
2456320	2457320	This one's for it.
2457320	2463320	This one's for Andy's birthday.
2463320	2467320	And he's been moonlighting at other podcasts.
2467320	2469320	But we're always happy to see him.
2469320	2470320	All right.
2470320	2473320	So what's that.
2473320	2474320	What else you got.
2474320	2475320	I want to bring out.
2475320	2490320	I want to bring out my my rabbi friend Spencer Crittenden.
2490320	2491320	All right.
2491320	2492320	I know I get to play my first high five.
2492320	2493320	That was a really good high five.
2493320	2494320	That was the weirdest.
2494320	2495320	I didn't get a high five.
2495320	2498320	I was about to say you know who didn't get a high five.
2498320	2499320	Yeah.
2499320	2500320	Ryan Ridley.
2501320	2502320	All right.
2502320	2504320	A lot of backstory to Spencer and I's relationship.
2504320	2509320	It's a very complex and storied history.
2509320	2511320	It'll come through.
2511320	2512320	It'll shine.
2512320	2515320	It always shines through.
2515320	2516320	It always shines through.
2516320	2518320	Do you have something you want to say Spencer.
2518320	2522320	I have so many things that I want to say right now.
2522320	2523320	All right.
2523320	2524320	Say one of them.
2524320	2525320	Okay.
2525320	2529320	What was all this you were saying about Helium Dan because I had some issues.
2529320	2531320	It's it's lighter than air.
2531320	2532320	It sure is.
2532320	2534320	And so the tank is lighter.
2534320	2541320	It is lighter than if you had a tank equally sized of say you know like air propane.
2541320	2542320	Yeah.
2542320	2543320	Or air.
2543320	2547320	It's still not you know it's not it's not lighter than air on its own.
2547320	2549320	It's just it's it's pressurized.
2549320	2551320	So it's it's denser than air.
2551320	2552320	But even pressurized.
2552320	2554320	It's lighter than pressurized air.
2554320	2556320	It's lighter than equally pressurized air.
2556320	2557320	Yeah.
2557320	2563320	So so so looking at a tank of helium that looked like a similar tank of propane.
2563320	2569320	I was like the reason why I was amazed as I lifted it up is because of what was inside it.
2569320	2570320	Helium.
2570320	2571320	Yeah.
2571320	2572320	All right.
2572320	2575320	Well I guess I don't have any issues then.
2575320	2578320	It just sounds like you're saying oh it's floating away.
2578320	2579320	It's this helium.
2579320	2580320	Yeah.
2580320	2581320	I mean I don't it's possible.
2581320	2582320	They got to get that shit blimps.
2582320	2585320	It's possible that the same way they dye cheddar cheese orange.
2585320	2589320	Like because otherwise you wouldn't think it was cheese.
2589320	2592320	They might make helium tanks lighter material.
2592320	2596320	You know so that you're like so that people are shopping for helium.
2596320	2598320	They're like fuck this brand of helium.
2598320	2599320	Yeah.
2599320	2602320	It takes fucking like you barely lifted Martha.
2602320	2603320	Oh look at this.
2603320	2604320	This is the light stuff.
2604320	2607320	This is a good one.
2607320	2608320	That's a good tank.
2609320	2613320	What's weird about the cheese thing you were talking about is they get you on both sides
2613320	2614320	with the cheese.
2614320	2615320	They dye it orange.
2615320	2616320	They're like oh this is cheese.
2616320	2618320	This is what cheese looks like orange.
2618320	2620320	And then they come back with you on the backside.
2620320	2623320	How about this fine aged white cheddar.
2623320	2624320	Yeah.
2624320	2626320	It's just the same cheese without fucking dyeing it.
2626320	2628320	And they say it's better.
2628320	2629320	Yeah.
2629320	2631320	But then they say it's good cheese because it has dye in it.
2631320	2634320	I'm upset about cheese.
2634320	2636320	I think you should be.
2636320	2638320	It's a lot better things.
2638320	2642320	That's the best thing I've been upset about in a while I guess.
2642320	2647320	Spencer I think that and I only say this because I'm a cheddar enthusiast and I'm not trying
2647320	2650320	to step on anything you're saying but I thank you.
2650320	2656320	I think that maybe when it's extra sharp or sharp it tends to be white and then regular
2656320	2658320	levels of sharpness that's the orange.
2658320	2660320	So maybe that's how they're distinguishing it.
2660320	2663320	You know outside of Tillamook I don't know what to say.
2663320	2668320	But a lot of a lot of cheeses are very sharp as well as orange.
2668320	2670320	So I mean I don't I don't know.
2670320	2673320	This is a great argument to have.
2673320	2675320	I don't know if it counts as an argument.
2675320	2676320	I'm arguing.
2676320	2677320	I think it does.
2677320	2679320	Well now it definitely is.
2679320	2681320	Well I agree with you.
2681320	2682320	So now it's not an argument.
2682320	2683320	Well I disagree.
2683320	2686320	Well I guess you disagree with me agreeing with you agreeing with you.
2686320	2687320	Yeah.
2687320	2688320	Hey Spencer.
2688320	2689320	Hey Ryan Ridley.
2689320	2692320	What's your favorite level of sharpness.
2692320	2695320	Um when I have I'd say you know.
2695320	2696320	Wait wait wait.
2696320	2701320	I just want the record to show that Ryan gave me a very sly look when he asked that question.
2701320	2702320	Watch this.
2702320	2704320	I think I finally figured this controlling out.
2704320	2711320	Like the trap has been set up to let her rip.
2711320	2712320	Extra sharp I guess.
2712320	2713320	So you go all the way.
2713320	2714320	That's the right answer.
2714320	2715320	All right.
2715320	2718320	Wait that's I could have made that up.
2718320	2719320	Ask me what my favorite.
2719320	2720320	Maybe extra sharp.
2720320	2721320	Ask me what my favorite type of denim is.
2721320	2723320	What's your favorite type of denim.
2723320	2727320	Uh high grade best denim.
2727320	2728320	He's right.
2728320	2729320	That's a good grade.
2729320	2731320	Extra sharp might be too sharp for some people.
2731320	2732320	Anybody.
2732320	2733320	Anybody.
2733320	2734320	Regular sharp.
2734320	2735320	Well why didn't you tell him he was right when he said extra sharp.
2735320	2738320	Because I hear how two people clapped.
2738320	2740320	Because I am right.
2740320	2741320	All right.
2741320	2742320	We got to get right.
2742320	2743320	Come on.
2743320	2744320	Geez opinions.
2744320	2745320	All right.
2745320	2746320	If you've just tuned in.
2746320	2752320	If you decide if you ask yourself what's going on in a minute.
2752320	2753320	54 of a podcast.
2753320	2758320	This may become a spin off podcast.
2758320	2761320	Geez craftsmen.
2761320	2767320	We went to Holland once me and Aaron and Rob Strava and his wife.
2767320	2773320	And we somehow like we had asked the travel agent like Eric.
2773320	2775320	She was like you want me to help you have a good time.
2775320	2781320	Not like that that sounds weird.
2781320	2786320	And we're like yeah I guess she's like you know you should take a tour of the windmills
2786320	2788320	and where they make the cheese and stuff.
2788320	2791320	And we were like okay at some point someone agreed to this.
2791320	2797320	So I think someone just asked the hotel owner like could they.
2797320	2801320	Is there someone that would want to take them out and look at the windmills and the cheese.
2801320	2804320	And then that guy must have been like okay sure.
2804320	2807320	And then got off the phone was like what the fuck are they talking about.
2807320	2808320	And called another guy.
2808320	2813320	So long story short like we get one morning we all have to get on our winter clothes
2813320	2818320	and go out in the front of the hotel where this guy who he's a cab driver
2818320	2821320	and he's just the guy that the hotel owner knows.
2821320	2825320	Can you drive them to the windmills and then and then also.
2825320	2828320	Yeah like like here's some extra money.
2828320	2830320	Tell them about the windmills and the cheese.
2830320	2834320	And so this guy was just walking around chain smoking talking about the windmills
2834320	2836320	but he was just a guy.
2836320	2840320	And we went into this cheese factory and that's when it got really weird
2840320	2845320	because he walked in and he was like trying to earn this money he made
2845320	2850320	but he was just a cab driver but he was in this cheese museum and factory.
2850320	2856320	So he was like walking up onto the exhibits and fucking with cheese.
2857320	2860320	Like touching the exhibit cheese.
2860320	2864320	And then people would come over and yell at him in Dutch
2864320	2868320	and then he'd say something in Dutch back and be pointing at us.
2868320	2872320	And I was clearly saying like look I have these four American people
2872320	2877320	like I'm being paid a lot of money and I'll give you 20% if you let me keep rolling with this.
2877320	2880320	And they would kind of walk away confused.
2880320	2883320	Go back behind the gift counter and he's like churning shit.
2883320	2886320	Like what the fucking like don't touch this.
2886320	2888320	He's behind the velvet rope going.
2888320	2893320	And then there's other tourists gathering and going like oh this guy's talking about how to make cheese.
2893320	2895320	He doesn't work there.
2895320	2897320	He had lost his mind.
2897320	2900320	He was a rogue cheese exhibitor.
2900320	2903320	And it was like and then he's like and then we do this and then we do that.
2903320	2906320	And he's like you kept using the word we and I'm looking around
2906320	2910320	and everyone in their dirndls and their wood shoes and their canapkin hats or whatever.
2910320	2915320	And they're like rolling their eyes and like the cab driver has taken over the museum.
2915320	2917320	He's lost his mind.
2917320	2918320	We don't have police here.
2918320	2920320	We just have a bunch of cameras.
2920320	2921320	Weed is legal.
2921320	2923320	So what is this?
2923320	2926320	And the guy like is just showing us how to make cheese.
2926320	2927320	He grates some.
2927320	2930320	He like peels off a slice and then he goes and we do this and we do this.
2930320	2932320	And then we eat it and it's good.
2932320	2933320	And he just eats it.
2933320	2937320	He eats the museum cheese.
2937320	2938320	He ate it.
2938320	2944320	It could have been like the cheese that George Washington brought to Holland.
2944320	2947320	He didn't know anyone there or what was going on.
2947320	2950320	He just kept it.
2950320	2952320	He's not he's not handling it with.
2952320	2953320	He doesn't have this is a dumb question.
2953320	2954320	No gloves right.
2954320	2955320	No.
2955320	2956320	No.
2956320	2958320	Cigarette nicotine fingers.
2958320	2959320	Just cheese.
2959320	2960320	He's in the front.
2960320	2961320	No gloves.
2961320	2962320	No gloves.
2962320	2963320	No gloves.
2963320	2964320	No.
2964320	2965320	No.
2965320	2967320	Cigarette nicotine fingers.
2967320	2971320	He's in the fucking there's mannequins next to him.
2971320	2973320	That's the environment he's in.
2973320	2982320	He's on a stage behind a rope designed to keep normal people like cab drivers from going
2982320	2991320	up and using what is essentially a fake kitchen to go oh let's make some cheese.
2991320	2993320	No we put a rope so you don't.
2993320	2998320	There's a mannequin pretending to make cheese in 1820.
2998320	3001320	That's what this is for is for looking.
3001320	3003320	He's pumping into shit.
3003320	3006320	He's fucking got one of those caps on.
3006320	3009320	He just looks like Benny Hill.
3009320	3011320	Did he seem like he knew when he was talking?
3011320	3012320	No.
3012320	3013320	Okay.
3013320	3014320	No.
3014320	3015320	No.
3015320	3017320	I should have known.
3017320	3020320	He knows that cheese is old milk.
3020320	3021320	That's it.
3021320	3028320	He knew everything I know about cheese and he had an accent and then he was just eating
3028320	3034320	shit and then we were walking around we just felt like the worst like American shitty third
3034320	3038320	act of fucking WALL-E people you know.
3038320	3043320	Like we just felt like we were these big fat boneless Americans that had like co-opted
3043320	3048320	some guy and he was like explaining to them money money money money cheese cheese cheese.
3048320	3052320	Now my son get his teeth fixed yes yes.
3052320	3057320	Oh hegemony.
3057320	3061320	I mean that sounds like a better tour than you'd ever get from an official cheese museum
3061320	3062320	tour.
3062320	3063320	Well I feel like you lucked out.
3063320	3068320	I wouldn't have gone to a cheese museum but I often every once in a while can look over
3068320	3071320	at my fiance and go do you remember when the cheese museum.
3071320	3073320	Yes I do and that's kind of fun.
3073320	3074320	That's good.
3074320	3075320	That's what traveling is really about.
3075320	3077320	In the moment it felt very awkward.
3077320	3079320	Did he offer you any of the cheese?
3079320	3080320	No.
3080320	3081320	What?
3081320	3082320	That's the weirdest part.
3082320	3083320	That is the weirdest part.
3083320	3086320	He ate it in front of everyone.
3086320	3091320	People were taking pictures of him and they thought he was like some kind of performer
3091320	3093320	like an improviser.
3093320	3097320	Like a cheese mascot like I'm a representative I don't know anything but I'm enthusiastic
3097320	3098320	and that's enough.
3098320	3100320	Or that he was part that he worked there.
3100320	3105320	They thought what they should have thought like because I don't know how long you could
3105320	3107320	have before someone tases you.
3107320	3109320	But museum staff just gave up.
3109320	3110320	They were like we don't want to touch this.
3110320	3111320	He was just insistent.
3111320	3116320	They said they did all a human should have to do which is please clearly I don't speak
3116320	3119320	their language but they were clearly saying please please stop.
3119320	3120320	Yeah.
3120320	3121320	Please stop.
3121320	3122320	Please stop running around.
3122320	3127320	Our private property like banging into things knocking over mannequins and stealing cheese.
3127320	3128320	Please stop doing that.
3128320	3130320	They don't give up that easily at the Louvre.
3130320	3131320	I know that much.
3131320	3135320	All right he's fucking with a Mona Lisa.
3135320	3136320	Yeah.
3136320	3137320	So you should go there.
3137320	3138320	I mean I don't know.
3138320	3139320	It's crazy.
3139320	3146320	It's weird windmills are weird.
3146320	3149320	You know what those things do on the inside when you see a picture of a windmill you're
3149320	3150320	like why do they make those.
3150320	3151320	It's just like big pinwheels.
3151320	3153320	You know when you're a kid you're like why do they.
3153320	3155320	That's a lot of work to put into.
3155320	3160320	You know the things on the inside they most of them they saw lumber.
3160320	3161320	You know what they do with it.
3161320	3164320	They make more windmills.
3164320	3168320	The windmills are like a virus.
3168320	3174320	They take over the T cells and then they just like we hadn't stopped these people in their
3174320	3175320	tracks.
3175320	3178320	The world would be covered with windmills for no reason other.
3178320	3179320	They wouldn't be generating electricity.
3179320	3183320	They would just be generating windmills.
3183320	3187320	We would make first contact on the flying saucer would bump off of the earth because
3187320	3189320	there would be these fucking blades spinning everywhere.
3189320	3196320	They would have eventually started making them out of plastic and they would have been
3196320	3197320	toxic.
3197320	3198320	It's very interesting though.
3198320	3201320	They make windmills over there.
3201320	3203320	There's people that make them just like they used to.
3203320	3206320	We're only going to use the equipment they used to use.
3206320	3209320	It just seems like so God you got to really be into something.
3209320	3214320	I have to tell you why that.
3214320	3216320	We think Civil War reenactors are weird.
3216320	3218320	These windmill reenactors.
3218320	3220320	They're like we're going to make a windmill.
3220320	3221320	We're not going to use any hammers.
3221320	3223320	We're not going to use anything made of metal.
3223320	3225320	Is there new cutting edge windmill technology?
3225320	3226320	Yes.
3226320	3227320	Sure.
3227320	3228320	Definitely.
3228320	3229320	Yeah.
3229320	3231320	Well do you mean like the things that generate wind power like electricity?
3231320	3233320	They don't just saw wood anymore.
3233320	3235320	What do they do now?
3235320	3237320	They generate electricity.
3237320	3240320	I don't know if you could call those windmills though.
3240320	3242320	I call them windmills.
3242320	3246320	They're mills wind.
3246320	3249320	I get like being into some OG windmill shit.
3249320	3254320	It's like you know guitar dads who like will only use two bands you know.
3254320	3258320	Who have like a man cave full of like old two bands and they got to get them replaced
3258320	3262320	at like one guitar shop in Calabasas and they know the guy behind the counter.
3262320	3266320	Like I'm sure that's how like vintage windmill heads are.
3266320	3272320	When I was programming like I was you know I used the VI editor and I didn't want to use my mouse.
3272320	3276320	I use the keys you know like it's a 35 year old like editor.
3276320	3283320	I want to design my own web page editing with text on an SSH connection or whatever.
3283320	3285320	I guess I was into the purity of that.
3285320	3286320	Yeah.
3286320	3290320	Well I mean like when I went to film school they make you edit film on a like a steamback
3290320	3292320	like an old school like spinning plates.
3292320	3294320	It's your little white gloves and you're like splicing.
3294320	3297320	Yep and your little like pencil to mark where an edit was.
3297320	3299320	And they're like okay so now you know how that works.
3299320	3300320	Here's final cut.
3300320	3301320	Yeah exactly.
3302320	3307320	It was such a colossal waste of time and my only takeaway from it is like that's the hardest thing I've ever done.
3307320	3311320	Yeah you're like that's why this mouse clicker is shaped like that.
3311320	3316320	That's why they use that icon because it's based on some guy with a white glove.
3316320	3324320	Just sitting there and the other thing I learned is like don't set an entire opened but full orange juice
3324320	3327320	on one of the spinning plates that the film goes on.
3328320	3331320	Yeah that was like four hours of my life.
3331320	3332320	But the film got done.
3332320	3342320	The montage of my friend dancing on the street set to an R.J. D2 beat got done and I got an A and then I moved to Los Angeles.
3342320	3343320	So I mean.
3344320	3349320	Did it get an A because in between you would just flash the words capitalism or something.
3349320	3350320	Yeah.
3350320	3352320	There was a lot of deep meaning.
3353320	3354320	Hey Dave.
3354320	3358320	Was it a pulp or pulp free.
3361320	3363320	I found my niche.
3365320	3366320	You did it.
3366320	3367320	He did it.
3367320	3368320	Come on.
3369320	3372320	What a great night for Comptroller Ryan Ridley.
3373320	3375320	This guy's great.
3375320	3378320	He cares about the minutiae of things you ingest.
3379320	3380320	That's his angle.
3380320	3381320	Ridley source.
3381320	3383320	Jeff wears suits.
3383320	3386320	You ask questions about eating.
3386320	3387320	Round of applause.
3387320	3389320	Crunchy peanut butter.
3394320	3396320	I heard somebody booing.
3398320	3400320	Creamy peanut butter.
3401320	3402320	Wow.
3402320	3403320	Even.
3403320	3404320	That's a 50-50 split.
3404320	3407320	But the creamy people were yelling and going whoo.
3407320	3408320	Well the creamy seemed forced.
3408320	3411320	Like they're like we really gotta stand up for creamy.
3412320	3414320	Well how many people are ambi peanut butter.
3414320	3416320	How many people can do crunchy or creamy.
3416320	3418320	Oh really not that many.
3419320	3422320	Why would you even bother with creamy is what I want to know.
3422320	3424320	I guess sometimes it's good.
3424320	3425320	I don't know.
3425320	3426320	I like both.
3426320	3427320	I wouldn't want either to be outlawed.
3430320	3434320	This is the gentlest conversation that's ever happened on this stage.
3435320	3439320	We're gonna be 85 years old and we could still have the same conversation.
3439320	3440320	That's what's nice about it.
3440320	3443320	We're like oh those ladies skirts keep getting shorter.
3445320	3446320	But peanut butter.
3446320	3449320	This is like the first 20 minutes of those Kirk Cameron Christian movies.
3450320	3451320	Hey man.
3451320	3455320	Hey if you want to know how to get the most peanut butter in the world I'm gonna tell you.
3456320	3458320	It's about the power of positivity.
3458320	3459320	Jesus Christ.
3462320	3463320	Pray.
3463320	3464320	Pray for it.
3465320	3467320	This is what drives me nuts about Christianity.
3468320	3474320	Not Christianity the actual mythology like which I think is I enjoy.
3475320	3477320	The story of a guy who got killed on purpose.
3477320	3478320	This is awesome.
3479320	3480320	That's fucking amazing.
3480320	3484320	It is truly like one of the top three greatest stories ever told.
3486320	3490320	I'm gonna go Iron Giant and Monster House for the other two.
3493320	3496320	You're saying you have a problem with the people who tell the story.
3496320	3497320	And how they tell it.
3497320	3501320	I have a problem with something that by proper definition shouldn't even be called Christianity
3501320	3505320	which is this like you know this kind of weird capitalist.
3505320	3510320	We're wearing suits and we're talking about Jesus and we even tell people you don't even have to read the Bible.
3510320	3512320	You know what's great about Christianity.
3512320	3514320	He's knocking at your door.
3514320	3518320	All you gotta do is accept him as your personal Christ and Savior blood of the bloodblood.
3520320	3521320	And that's it.
3521320	3522320	And that's it.
3522320	3523320	And just keep coming back and let's just hang out.
3523320	3524320	Let's just be Christian.
3525320	3532320	It's like this frantic like thing that has absolutely no love for the actual mythology anymore.
3532320	3534320	So it's clearly like totally separated from it.
3534320	3537320	Especially the fact that you don't you know don't get me started on it.
3537320	3539320	I mean literally nobody clapped.
3539320	3546320	This is an audience of like I think this is mahogany dense atheist like log here.
3548320	3550320	I don't know how that happened.
3550320	3553320	I guess I'll take that as a compliment like I'm very smart or something.
3553320	3554320	So I just attract atheists.
3556320	3565320	But so I don't think I would think I would be preaching to the non choir by by ranting about this.
3565320	3572320	But I just I think the thing that makes most people atheists and proud of it and evangelical about it is that this is this.
3572320	3581320	It's a very it's a modern American phenomenon that happens to be called Christianity which has absolutely nothing to do with the ethos the pathos
3582320	3583320	or the porthos.
3586320	3596320	I demand a religion hit all three musketeers before I accept it.
3598320	3599320	Even the jolly drunk.
3599320	3601320	What the fuck is that fourth musketeer.
3601320	3603320	He's just a guy who is that guy.
3603320	3604320	Well he's the guy.
3604320	3605320	He's our road in.
3605320	3610320	Why didn't he get lumped in because he's he's like there to like he's like the kid in Treasure Island.
3610320	3612320	He's like those three musketeers.
3612320	3613320	All right.
3613320	3614320	I've never read it seen the movies.
3614320	3616320	I just know there's a fourth guy.
3616320	3618320	And I'm like why isn't it called the four musketeers.
3618320	3619320	But OK I get it.
3619320	3620320	I bet.
3620320	3623320	I bet at the end they say from now on here's your sword.
3623320	3625320	Hey D'Artagnan get.
3625320	3626320	Give me a.
3626320	3628320	Can you get me one of those swords.
3628320	3629320	Yeah sure.
3629320	3630320	Earthos.
3631320	3632320	It brings it back.
3632320	3634320	He's like any hands it to Earthos and Earthos is like no.
3635320	3636320	No one's yours.
3636320	3645320	All for one and one plus one for all.
3645320	3651320	And then as it as the crane shot goes away you just hear an ADR line from D'Artagnan going what about my musket.
3653320	3656320	Because am I crazy or should we have muskets.
3656320	3658320	Why are we famous for sword fighting.
3661320	3663320	This is insane what we do.
3663320	3665320	Why are we putting so much energy into swords.
3667320	3669320	They invented the gun for us.
3673320	3674320	Let's shoot some love.
3674320	3678320	I feel like D'Artagnan's inclusion is probably conditional.
3678320	3682320	Like even if at the end he gets his own sword he probably still has to drive like turtle from entourage.
3682320	3683320	You know what I mean.
3683320	3689320	Like you can hang out turtle like you can have like the fourth hottest girl but you got to drive the escalate.
3690320	3693320	He has to hang up the flyers and book the rooms.
3694320	3695320	Hey guys.
3695320	3696320	We're having a duel.
3696320	3697320	Here we go.
3697320	3698320	We're having a duel.
3698320	3699320	It's going to be like.
3699320	3700320	It's going to be dope.
3700320	3703320	When the musketeers come into town he goes into the hotel when they stay in the van.
3703320	3705320	He comes back out with other keys.
3705320	3706320	Okay.
3706320	3707320	I'm going to be spinning.
3707320	3708320	It's going to be dope.
3714320	3716320	Well what do you think Spencer.
3716320	3718320	You think you think these guys could play.
3718320	3720320	We play some of this D&D stuff.
3720320	3721320	I don't know Dan.
3721320	3723320	I don't think they got what it takes.
3723320	3724320	Hey what.
3726320	3727320	Maybe it's a little early.
3727320	3729320	Should we should we meet one out of town friend before we.
3732320	3733320	Who drove far.
3734320	3736320	Who is here from a far away.
3736320	3738320	Scotland I heard Orange County.
3747320	3748320	Australia.
3748320	3750320	We did Australia last week.
3750320	3752320	Not that that's how it works.
3753320	3756320	I know there's I know there's millions of people there.
3757320	3759320	But we were out of kangaroo jokes.
3759320	3760320	What was the.
3760320	3761320	What did you say.
3761320	3762320	Boston.
3762320	3763320	That's nice.
3763320	3764320	I like it in Boston.
3764320	3765320	It's like Milwaukee.
3765320	3766320	It's like the Milwaukee of the East Coast.
3766320	3768320	Who's from the most dangerous place.
3768320	3769320	Boston.
3769320	3770320	Australia.
3770320	3771320	Yeah.
3771320	3772320	They're peopled with criminals.
3772320	3773320	That's exactly.
3775320	3776320	Scott.
3776320	3778320	Let's say let's say Scott Scotland person.
3778320	3779320	Are you.
3780320	3784320	Are you willing to come up and share your share your persona
3784320	3785320	with us?
3786320	3787320	No.
3787320	3788320	OK.
3788320	3789320	OK.
3789320	3792320	That person is off to a good start.
3792320	3793320	Yeah.
3793320	3794320	She's very positive.
3796320	3798320	We don't pick on anybody here.
3799320	3800320	Hello.
3800320	3801320	Hello.
3801320	3803320	You look like a Scottish movie Scottish person.
3804320	3806320	She's wearing boots and tights
3806320	3809320	and like a t-shirt that says Trey cool on it.
3809320	3811320	Although that's that's French.
3811320	3812320	No no not at all.
3812320	3814320	No I'm applauding your Scottishness.
3814320	3816320	It's like indie movie Scottish.
3816320	3818320	Like it's like a movie that's really good
3818320	3820320	but there's subtitles because they're so Scottish.
3824320	3825320	So what's your name?
3825320	3826320	Paula.
3826320	3827320	Paula.
3827320	3828320	What part of Scotland?
3828320	3829320	Just say Glasgow.
3829320	3830320	OK.
3830320	3831320	I think I know where that is.
3831320	3832320	But.
3832320	3835320	The opposite side where he's wearing a.
3835320	3837320	Where we where we were for a hagwini.
3837320	3838320	Yeah.
3838320	3839320	Yeah.
3839320	3840320	Edinburgh.
3840320	3841320	Edinburgh.
3841320	3842320	Edinburgh.
3842320	3843320	Which is spelled Edinburgh.
3843320	3844320	But then it's a trap.
3844320	3845320	It's a trap.
3848320	3850320	It seems like a nice Jewish town Edinburgh.
3854320	3855320	Just went there to get some relaxation.
3855320	3856320	Everyone's carrying torches.
3856320	3857320	It's fucking crazy.
3857320	3859320	Do you ever do hagwini in Edinburgh?
3859320	3863320	I've done it in Glasgow and then it's usually just house parties.
3863320	3864320	But no.
3864320	3865320	Oh OK.
3865320	3866320	I don't really like Edinburgh.
3866320	3867320	We did that.
3867320	3868320	We did the whole torch procession when we were there.
3868320	3869320	It was crazy.
3869320	3871320	It seems kind of dangerous having that many people in torches.
3871320	3872320	I know but it's yeah.
3872320	3874320	When you do something that dangerous with a group of people.
3874320	3875320	Yeah alcohol is flammable.
3878320	3880320	I guess we've already talked about it on the show
3880320	3882320	but it was like it was really uplifting because it really
3882320	3885320	made you feel like oh America's like wearing this big diaper.
3885320	3889320	Like we were obsessed with tits and violence and bad words
3889320	3890320	and like all these things.
3890320	3893320	America's got a lot of great things about it.
3893320	3895320	Fluoride in the water in most cities.
3898320	3899320	I don't know.
3899320	3900320	We're great.
3900320	3901320	Golden Ninja television.
3901320	3902320	Mostly our responsibility.
3902320	3903320	You should starve something.
3903320	3904320	Get them out on the streets.
3904320	3907320	Get people carrying torches out in the streets.
3907320	3908320	Well as we've spoken.
3908320	3910320	There's another reason we don't do it here.
3910320	3913320	It has an unfortunate like feel to it for us.
3914320	3917320	Like it doesn't it doesn't represent his passion.
3917320	3920320	It's more of a cowardly like I've got a flaming stick.
3920320	3921320	Get away black guy.
3923320	3924320	Stop taking our germs.
3926320	3928320	But it was like we did this big parade.
3928320	3931320	We're all carrying these torches and it was like there were kids
3931320	3934320	and everyone was like there's fucking like you know you buy
3934320	3937320	the torches at like a wall whatever the equivalent of a Walmart
3937320	3940320	is like and it's like they sell them because it's
3940320	3942320	everyone's going to do this thing.
3942320	3945320	And it's kind of cool because it's like the opposite of disempowering
3945320	3948320	a population like you know nobody does anything bad with the torches
3948320	3951320	but you're being allowed to carry fire which is dangerous
3951320	3954320	and like and everyone's walking and there's like embers falling
3954320	3956320	on your hair and your clothes and there's like a little bit
3956320	3959320	a little bit of like singeing and fire happening.
3959320	3960320	But everyone's fine.
3960320	3961320	Everyone turns out fine.
3961320	3965320	And then you go watch this wicker wicker thing start on fire.
3965320	3968320	So I you're saying to me and they're playing.
3968320	3971320	The only the only problem is they're playing like they're
3971320	3973320	they're playing music the whole way.
3973320	3976320	They have speakers set up the whole like many mile like march
3976320	3980320	and they're playing like Scottish like rock bands
3980320	3983320	the stuff like like like and after a while you've heard
3983320	3985320	the same ones like five times in a row.
3985320	3989320	Really so many like breakout Scottish like fucking hey
3989320	3991320	like these guys again huh.
3991320	3993320	So anyways Glasgow.
3993320	3994320	All right.
3994320	3997320	I think we were near near near there.
3997320	4000320	You referenced our our our trip there.
4000320	4003320	Did what were you are you connected to us somehow
4003320	4005320	or because I know Jeff put people on the guest list
4005320	4006320	for tonight.
4006320	4008320	But are you you're just you just you just heard
4008320	4010320	the podcast and heard that we went to Scotland twice
4010320	4013320	before nearly got kicked out twice because I was here
4013320	4015320	with a friend or drunk.
4015320	4016320	Oh is that you.
4022320	4023320	Is she here tonight.
4023320	4024320	No.
4024320	4025320	Okay.
4025320	4026320	Was that the problem.
4026320	4027320	You had to like restructure your friend.
4027320	4028320	I'm doing okay.
4028320	4029320	So far.
4029320	4030320	No you're great.
4030320	4032320	You're very very gentle and well-mannered.
4032320	4034320	I you were fine that night too.
4034320	4037320	I don't I mean I who cares.
4037320	4039320	Drunk people from Scotland yelling things out.
4039320	4041320	It's probably the best thing that happened to show.
4042320	4044320	So what do you what are you on vacation.
4044320	4047320	I was in Salt Lake City for Comic Con.
4047320	4048320	They have a Comic Con in Salt Lake City.
4048320	4049320	Yeah it's huge.
4049320	4050320	Wow.
4050320	4053320	It's the second year and it was pretty crazy.
4053320	4054320	Wow.
4054320	4055320	I like that I was I was in Salt Lake.
4055320	4056320	They're very nice people.
4056320	4058320	I think I think it's again like we did the tour there
4058320	4060320	and it's like the Mormon thing is so strong there.
4060320	4063320	Maybe that that's why it was like the hipster the hipster
4063320	4065320	crowd there is very hip because they're like breaking away
4065320	4066320	from it.
4066320	4068320	It was mainly people from Salt Lake there.
4068320	4070320	I don't think there was many out of towners.
4070320	4071320	Well I don't know.
4071320	4072320	I didn't speak to me.
4072320	4073320	Yeah.
4073320	4075320	I mean like we had a packed house and we did a show there
4075320	4078320	and everybody was really thoughtful and cool and fun
4078320	4079320	and passionate.
4079320	4082320	And it's probably it's a it's probably a tough city to be
4082320	4084320	anything fringy in I would imagine.
4084320	4086320	Maybe that's a stereotype that's outgrown.
4086320	4087320	I don't know.
4088320	4090320	Mormons aren't the biggest fringe of them all.
4095320	4097320	Don't turn on your guest comptroller yet.
4097320	4099320	He's going to come back.
4099320	4101320	He's going to ask you about bread and butter versus dill
4101320	4102320	pickles at the end.
4102320	4103320	I know it.
4103320	4105320	And you're going to wish that you hadn't.
4107320	4108320	I got you buddy.
4108320	4109320	I thought they'd like that.
4109320	4110320	I liked it.
4111320	4114320	Also if you're Mormon and you're listening I have no
4114320	4116320	absolutely no judgment.
4116320	4117320	I do.
4120320	4121320	I'm going to double down.
4122320	4123320	Smart.
4123320	4124320	Not smart.
4124320	4126320	What the fuck is that shit?
4129320	4132320	So you're you're you've had Jews.
4132320	4133320	Yeah.
4133320	4135320	Christians and they were on Mormons.
4135320	4137320	We had well we were in Salt Lake City.
4137320	4140320	I had a Mormon come up and explain some of the things
4140320	4142320	like OK let's talk about this magic underwear.
4142320	4144320	Let's talk about the stuff because she was she was a
4144320	4145320	very sweet.
4145320	4147320	Like she was a Harman town fan and she was just in this
4147320	4149320	town where she was probably surrounded by people who are
4149320	4150320	like fucking Mormons.
4150320	4151320	I don't know though.
4151320	4152320	I don't really know what's going on there.
4152320	4154320	But but how people feel about it.
4154320	4156320	I'm sure they're all 25 and they fucking don't care
4156320	4157320	anymore.
4157320	4159320	And I'm like 41 and going oh Mormonism.
4159320	4161320	But but she she was.
4161320	4162320	Yeah.
4162320	4163320	She came up and talked about it.
4163320	4165320	I mean what religion it says on the bottle.
4165320	4167320	This isn't supposed to make sense.
4167320	4170320	If you buy a religion like and then you open the bottle
4170320	4172320	and you're like this isn't logical.
4172320	4174320	Like you're an idiot.
4174320	4177320	Like it's like it's like buying a pair of pants and then
4177320	4179320	trying to drink out of them.
4179320	4181320	And you're like this sucks.
4181320	4182320	I want my money back.
4182320	4186320	It's like motherfucker it goes on your legs.
4186320	4189320	Your legs in this case being the part of your brain that
4189320	4193320	doesn't understand shit and doesn't and frustrated and
4193320	4196320	wonders what your relationship with an impersonal cosmos is
4196320	4198320	and is afraid you're going to die.
4198320	4201320	And like it's going insane because of the truly
4201320	4204320	schizophrenic result of being the world's first and
4204320	4210320	possibly last sentient mammal except dolphins who don't
4210320	4214320	need a religion because they don't have hands.
4214320	4216320	So they know so they don't have weapons.
4216320	4217320	So they don't have war.
4217320	4219320	So they don't need religion.
4219320	4221320	They don't they just see a shark and they're like fuck
4221320	4226320	sharks like dolphins go crazy at sharks.
4226320	4229320	Did you know that they fucking hate sharks.
4229320	4232320	Isn't that cool.
4232320	4233320	It is cool.
4233320	4234320	It is fucking cool.
4234320	4236320	Because dolphins are us in the ocean.
4236320	4238320	They represent us.
4238320	4244320	You know like they are Ryan and Dave you might say the
4244320	4247320	dolphins are the are the Israelis in the Middle East
4247320	4248320	that is the ocean.
4248320	4250320	Oh now I'm listening.
4250320	4251320	I don't know.
4251320	4252320	Hold on.
4252320	4254320	They're like building apartments on all these.
4254320	4263320	How suddenly I'm sympathizing for the sharks.
4263320	4264320	I know.
4264320	4267320	And I accidentally just called Muslim sharks and
4267320	4268320	thought it was cool.
4268320	4269320	That's not I didn't.
4269320	4271320	That is not what I meant.
4271320	4272320	Sorry about that.
4272320	4275320	Do they know that sharks are the bad guys.
4275320	4276320	That's what it is.
4276320	4278320	I mean they think well I mean think about it.
4278320	4282320	Dolphins are mammals that breathe oxygen and like they
4282320	4286320	have language and shit like they're a new they're
4286320	4287320	they're like us.
4287320	4288320	What did you say.
4288320	4289320	They're assholes.
4289320	4290320	Dolphins are assholes.
4290320	4291320	They're assholes.
4291320	4293320	Okay well you're coming up in one second sir.
4293320	4295320	I think they already heard you.
4295320	4298320	A guy with an accent I can't place just just blurted
4298320	4299320	out they're assholes.
4299320	4301320	Dolphins are assholes.
4301320	4304320	Well what about sharks.
4304320	4305320	Okay all right sir.
4305320	4308320	No opinion on sharks but dolphins are assholes.
4308320	4309320	No you stay Paula.
4309320	4310320	It's Paula right.
4310320	4311320	Yeah.
4311320	4312320	You sit there sir.
4312320	4313320	What's your name.
4313320	4314320	Andy.
4314320	4315320	Andy.
4315320	4316320	Okay so explain.
4316320	4317320	Dolphins are assholes.
4317320	4319320	Dolphins are well male dolphins are assholes.
4319320	4320320	Male dolphins.
4320320	4322320	Yeah yeah they separate the women from the pack and then
4322320	4325320	don't let them back into the pod until they've had sex
4325320	4326320	with them.
4326320	4327320	Oh okay.
4327320	4330320	Well so when you dig into dolphin like gender hierarchies
4330320	4331320	okay.
4331320	4333320	That's interesting.
4333320	4335320	Yeah we're looking at it from very far away.
4335320	4338320	They're so smart and they're like yeah we're smart enough
4338320	4339320	to hate bitches.
4340320	4341320	Well hold on.
4342320	4343320	They don't get to dolphin vote.
4343320	4344320	I think well.
4351320	4353320	Dave you were going to say something about.
4358320	4360320	I was just going to say hashtag yes all dolphins.
4361320	4365320	So Andy is that is that a dolphin fact you picked up
4365320	4369320	just as a casual dolphin fan or are you like a I want you
4369320	4371320	to say you're an oceanographer.
4372320	4375320	Who like who like really love dolphins and then they fucking
4375320	4376320	let you down.
4377320	4379320	Like you you spent eight years learning to communicate with
4379320	4381320	them to the point where you could hear their opinions
4381320	4382320	about women.
4382320	4383320	I don't know.
4383320	4384320	I don't know.
4384320	4385320	I don't know.
4385320	4386320	I don't know.
4386320	4387320	I don't know.
4387320	4389320	To the point where you could hear their opinions about
4389320	4391320	women and you're like fuck.
4392320	4394320	I learned to squeak for this.
4395320	4396320	This guy's rapey.
4398320	4401320	Sure he could put a ball in the circular hole but he fucking
4401320	4402320	hates women.
4403320	4406320	It was one of those articles you know 20 things about awful
4406320	4409320	things you know about you don't know about animals I mean don't
4409320	4410320	get started on office.
4410320	4413320	So it was all different animals like like koala bears
4414320	4416320	believe in separate but equal.
4421320	4424320	They have they have specially labeled eucalyptus trees.
4425320	4427320	No man they're just starting all the time.
4429320	4431320	Kittens like euthanasia.
4432320	4433320	Kittens.
4433320	4435320	What's the shit you didn't know about kittens.
4435320	4436320	They're really conservative.
4437320	4439320	They believe that milk should trickle down from their
4439320	4440320	mother's nipples.
4441320	4442320	They hate abortion.
4444320	4445320	The.
4445320	4446320	All right.
4446320	4447320	Well.
4447320	4448320	So.
4448320	4449320	But OK.
4449320	4451320	Well Andy I mean is it OK if you just make a cameo and then
4451320	4452320	we're not quite done with Paula.
4453320	4454320	Is there anything else to say about dolphins.
4454320	4456320	Did you know anything else about him.
4456320	4457320	No.
4457320	4458320	OK.
4458320	4459320	All right.
4459320	4460320	Andy everybody dolphin expert Andy.
4464320	4468320	I mean maybe this is maybe this is just deja vu but I could
4468320	4471320	swear that earlier on on an earlier episode a guy with a
4471320	4475320	foreign accent said that dolphins were assholes and then
4475320	4478320	came up and defended his remarks like on a different episode
4478320	4479320	though.
4479320	4480320	And a different guy.
4480320	4483320	Yeah I'd assume I mean I hope so because he played it off like
4483320	4485320	he'd never done it before this time.
4485320	4488320	It would be amazing if we were living in his edge of tomorrow.
4488320	4489320	I probably just.
4490320	4494320	Fuck I could swear and he's like no I've told you this 900
4494320	4495320	times.
4496320	4497320	Now I have to go get shot.
4498320	4500320	If I could just get you to understand dolphins are assholes
4500320	4501320	by nine twenty seven.
4503320	4506320	I could then roll under the jeeps tires at nine thirty five
4506320	4508320	just dolphins burst in from the ceiling.
4516320	4518320	So Paula were you born in Glasgow.
4518320	4519320	Yes.
4519320	4521320	Do you know what the Glasgow grin is.
4521320	4522320	I should hope so.
4522320	4523320	The Glasgow grin.
4523320	4524320	Yeah.
4524320	4525320	I guess not.
4526320	4529320	That's I guess in America we know maybe it's like a thing like
4529320	4531320	it's like a Chinese fire drill.
4531320	4533320	It's like actually offensive to people from Glasgow.
4533320	4534320	Oh yeah.
4534320	4535320	It's a classic.
4535320	4536320	Is it.
4536320	4537320	That's like.
4537320	4539320	They call that someplace called a Chelsea girl.
4539320	4540320	A Chelsea girl.
4540320	4541320	Depends where you live.
4542320	4544320	If you're working in real estate in Glasgow you call it a
4544320	4545320	Chelsea girl.
4546320	4547320	All right.
4549320	4551320	Is it the Sons of Anarchy guy that thing.
4551320	4552320	Yeah the Sons of Anarchy guy.
4552320	4553320	Yes.
4553320	4555320	It's definitely bad right.
4555320	4556320	It's not.
4556320	4557320	It's an ironic name.
4557320	4558320	Physical mutilation.
4558320	4559320	Yeah.
4559320	4560320	But is it done to you or.
4560320	4561320	Yes.
4561320	4562320	Yes.
4562320	4563320	Okay.
4563320	4564320	It's physical mutilation.
4566320	4567320	You can do it.
4567320	4568320	You're up.
4568320	4569320	Well fuck them.
4569320	4570320	How about now.
4572320	4573320	Yeah.
4573320	4574320	Yeah.
4574320	4575320	The Sons of Anarchy guy.
4575320	4576320	He's from Glasgow.
4576320	4577320	Right.
4577320	4578320	Is this like why so serious.
4578320	4579320	The guy that.
4579320	4581320	I don't know I got these scars.
4581320	4582320	Yes.
4582320	4583320	Got it.
4583320	4585320	I don't know it's Sons of Anarchy but I've seen.
4585320	4586320	The Dark Knight.
4586320	4588320	I forgot the title.
4588320	4591320	Do you guys think it's cool that I know the name of the
4591320	4593320	second pendant movie.
4595320	4597320	I can't I can't troll for applause anymore.
4597320	4599320	I already wasted it on that one.
4599320	4600320	Sorry.
4600320	4602320	Hey what do you think the dark what kind of peanut butter do
4602320	4604320	you think the Dark Knight prefers.
4605320	4606320	Crunchy.
4606320	4607320	Crunchy.
4611320	4614320	You guys can't keep eating peanut butter like me.
4614320	4616320	What makes you so special.
4621320	4623320	I'm not using portable smokers.
4625320	4626320	I couldn't think of it.
4627320	4629320	Everybody said that hockey pants thing and it's just
4629320	4630320	everyone went.
4630320	4631320	Alarmed.
4631320	4632320	I'm not wearing hockey pants.
4633320	4634320	All right.
4634320	4637320	Paula are you would you be willing to stay up here and
4637320	4641320	play my fiance's character in Dungeons and Dragons.
4641320	4642320	You think you can handle it.
4642320	4644320	I mean you know there's nothing to handle.
4644320	4647320	It's like it doesn't matter how good you are at it.
4647320	4649320	I've never played it but I'll give it back.
4649320	4651320	Have you heard us play it on the podcast once.
4651320	4652320	OK.
4652320	4653320	Yeah.
4653320	4655320	It's like what happens is those guys I hope those women
4655320	4658320	are all peeing and not like doing a walkout like that.
4659320	4662320	Like like they're they're going to go kill some dolphins.
4664320	4666320	I had their fucking assholes.
4670320	4671320	The.
4671320	4673320	Also why did I say I hope they're peeing.
4673320	4674320	That's weird to say.
4675320	4676320	What is this Hustler magazine.
4679320	4681320	Remember when Hustler turned into being about peeing
4681320	4682320	women peeing.
4682320	4683320	No.
4684320	4687320	When was that like Hustler like if you open a hustler like
4687320	4689320	it's like there's a lot of it's like somebody started
4689320	4692320	complaining at some point when there weren't women peeing.
4693320	4695320	And so there's just like they make sure that there's always
4695320	4696320	a woman peeing now.
4696320	4698320	You think there was like an executive decision like a
4698320	4700320	meeting was called to be like guys.
4700320	4703320	Now it's like starting next month at least once a month.
4703320	4704320	Yeah.
4704320	4707320	I think it was obviously like I don't know like I I
4707320	4710320	learned about naked women from pages of Hustler magazine
4710320	4713320	that floated across the railroad tracks into the
4713320	4715320	crawdad creek where we would hunt crawdad.
4716320	4717320	They sound like Mark Twain.
4720320	4722320	But there was like like like there was no Internet and
4722320	4726320	there was just like mud caked pages from this printing
4726320	4730320	plant that apparently printed hustlers across the railroad
4730320	4731320	tracks.
4731320	4734320	And that's where the other nine year olds and I would go
4734320	4735320	like that's a booby.
4735320	4736320	That's what.
4736320	4738320	And then we would read this stuff like hey you can read
4738320	4739320	better.
4740320	4743320	Would your pussy like my dick in it.
4743320	4744320	This is great.
4746320	4747320	What does she say.
4747320	4748320	What does she say.
4748320	4751320	The next page is missing laying laying home awake at
4751320	4753320	night and I hope she I hope her pussy like this dick
4753320	4754320	in it.
4757320	4758320	And she was a waitress.
4758320	4760320	He was a truck driver and they just started to it was a
4760320	4764320	pictorial story but the text was what was important.
4764320	4767320	That is so much folksier than how this generation like
4767320	4768320	sees pornography.
4768320	4769320	Yeah.
4769320	4770320	And I don't know what's better.
4770320	4771320	Well it's but it's gross.
4771320	4773320	I mean it's like I'm looking at my first female figure
4773320	4775320	and it's like caked in mud.
4775320	4778320	It's a it's a pretty fundamentally misogynistic
4778320	4779320	periodic literature.
4779320	4784320	The pages of which are smeared with mud a stench of
4784320	4786320	crawdad and algae.
4786320	4788320	It's kind of like I'm learning.
4788320	4790320	Either that's like the healthiest thing in the world
4790320	4795320	like Yoda's in a tree stump going yes the vagina is a
4795320	4802320	terrifying place to go inside and I go in there and I
4803320	4807320	fight something and then my face is on the clitoris or I
4807320	4810320	come out and I go like I can't talk about it.
4810320	4813320	I'm going to go to Hollywood.
4813320	4814320	But but the Internet.
4814320	4815320	Yeah.
4815320	4817320	It's like like like I talked to moms now and they're
4817320	4819320	like you know my eight year old kid.
4819320	4821320	What's that about the hustlers.
4821320	4824320	No no no about about the about the new hustler which is
4824320	4826320	even YouTube even if you were to have like some kind
4826320	4830320	of nanny blocker software which is a joke like you can't
4830320	4831320	control your kid.
4831320	4834320	Even YouTube is just like I mean nobody knows better
4834320	4835320	than me.
4835320	4839320	It is filled with perfectly sexual material like like
4839320	4841320	what do you like.
4841320	4843320	So like your eight year old kid will just be like you
4843320	4845320	know sitting with his eight year old friend.
4845320	4847320	What did we do when we were eight year old boys.
4847320	4851320	We would we would make these jokes about sex.
4851320	4853320	You know we would talk about sex with each other.
4853320	4854320	We were way off the mark.
4854320	4857320	We were very curious about it and we were just
4857320	4858320	fascinated with it.
4858320	4860320	And if you had a laptop back then and you could just
4860320	4863320	be in and if you could be the kid that brought the
4863320	4866320	other kids to some piece of information about it you
4866320	4867320	were a hero.
4867320	4870320	So there's a capitalistic like competition there.
4870320	4871320	There's no way to control it.
4871320	4875320	I'm really fascinated to talk to moms these days who
4875320	4877320	are these moms you're talking to.
4877320	4881320	Well like I'm 41 my contemporaries have children
4881320	4884320	like they're you know funny funny women who do
4884320	4888320	storytelling shows who have kids that are like they
4888320	4892320	are like watching shit that's fucked up and hearing
4892320	4894320	them talk about it is very interesting.
4894320	4896320	If only I could remember that one lady's name that I'm
4896320	4900320	characterizing as all these women.
4900320	4906320	But the dolphin in me says who cares what her name is.
4906320	4909320	You know let her have the kid and like see if she earns
4909320	4913320	the right to swim swim swim and what do they eat shrimp.
4913320	4914320	I don't know.
4914320	4915320	All right.
4915320	4916320	They hate sharks.
4916320	4919320	They see a shark and they fucking like ram it with their
4919320	4921320	noses until the shark is good and dead.
4921320	4922320	They don't.
4922320	4927320	It's not about anything other than like hatred.
4927320	4931320	And if a person's drowning Andy if a person's drowning
4931320	4933320	sexist or not and I don't know if they don't do it for
4933320	4940320	women but they they tend to like save drowning humans.
4940320	4942320	They see us thrashing around and they're kind of like
4942320	4945320	what are you doing dipshit.
4945320	4950320	I also also maybe seals do that possibly too.
4950320	4954320	That sounded like I just made that up which I kind of did.
4954320	4957320	I'm basing that off of the documentary The Bridge which
4957320	4959320	is one of the people jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge.
4959320	4961320	Don't woo that.
4961320	4963320	The saddest documentary.
4963320	4965320	So this director is here.
4965320	4969320	We captured a lot of suicides on camera.
4969320	4970320	This one's for the crew.
4970320	4974320	John Perignon.
4974320	4977320	In that movie there's one kid who jumped off the Golden
4977320	4982320	Gate Bridge and he's he's I mean most of the people are
4982320	4984320	not in the documentary talking about their experience
4984320	4986320	jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge but he is because he
4986320	4987320	survived.
4987320	4990320	He broke his whole body hitting the water.
4990320	4994320	And by the way God at the end of it he felt you all.
4994320	4995320	Yeah.
4995320	4996320	That was kind of a yeah.
4996320	5000320	He he he he jumped and he he broke his legs and his back
5000320	5002320	and all this shit in the water and then he was like he's
5002320	5004320	like oh my God I failed to kill myself.
5004320	5007320	I am now drowning and this thing underneath him kept
5007320	5010320	bumping him and keeping his head above water and he
5010320	5013320	believes it was a seal or he described it to someone
5013320	5015320	they said it was a seal and then he goes and if that's
5015320	5021320	not proof of Jesus I don't know what it is.
5021320	5024320	What a what a wasted a wasted opportunity to become a
5024320	5028320	really passionate marine biologist.
5028320	5033320	I guess he took the easier path.
5033320	5035320	The human eyes too complicated.
5035320	5036320	Fuck it.
5036320	5038320	Intelligent design.
5038320	5041320	Maybe become an optician.
5041320	5042320	Did I say that word right.
5042320	5043320	OK.
5043320	5044320	All right.
5044320	5048320	So dolphins are sexist.
5048320	5050320	Jews are great.
5050320	5051320	Christians are great.
5051320	5054320	They just they just waste too much time having lock-ins
5054320	5057320	and dolphins are Jews.
5057320	5058320	Yeah.
5058320	5060320	We landed on it.
5060320	5063320	It's dolphins are Jews.
5063320	5064320	Yeah.
5064320	5065320	Yeah.
5065320	5067320	I did not mean to say I want to say that.
5067320	5068320	It sure was.
5068320	5070320	I have one last question.
5070320	5072320	I mean like literally.
5072320	5075320	You know how a giant squids and killer whales are
5075320	5077320	fighting all the time.
5077320	5080320	No.
5080320	5081320	Look it up.
5081320	5082320	Yeah.
5082320	5083320	Look it up.
5083320	5085320	They know what I'm talking about.
5086320	5088320	You're talking about.
5088320	5089320	I mean we all get it.
5089320	5091320	They fight all the time.
5091320	5092320	Yeah.
5092320	5094320	They fight all the time on the sci-fi.
5094320	5097320	No one's ever seen it but there's pictures of it.
5097320	5098320	Mega squids.
5098320	5101320	Is Debbie Gibson in the frame.
5101320	5102320	Who are the good guy.
5102320	5104320	Who's the good guy and who's the bad guy in that.
5104320	5105320	Between a giant squid.
5105320	5109320	Between a mammal and a fucking ridiculous fish monster.
5109320	5111320	I don't think a shark is a mammal.
5111320	5112320	They're killer whales.
5112320	5113320	They're mammals.
5113320	5114320	Oh killer whales.
5114320	5115320	So you automatically.
5115320	5117320	Sperm whales.
5117320	5118320	Sperm whales.
5118320	5120320	They look like a killer whale.
5120320	5122320	The pictures I've seen.
5122320	5124320	You're always going to be on a mammal's side.
5124320	5125320	You always have to be?
5125320	5126320	Yes.
5126320	5127320	Why?
5127320	5128320	In a fight.
5128320	5129320	Okay.
5129320	5130320	Let me explain this.
5130320	5131320	As if it needs to be explained.
5131320	5133320	It's the opposite of racist.
5133320	5134320	What?
5134320	5139320	If a human is fighting a chimp side with the human.
5139320	5140320	Wait.
5140320	5143320	If two chimps are fighting I don't know.
5144320	5147320	I'll get back to you.
5147320	5150320	Side with the bonobo.
5150320	5153320	If a gorilla and a chimp are fighting side with a chimp.
5153320	5159320	If a squid and a whale are fighting side with the whale.
5159320	5162320	You can side with your branch of evolution.
5162320	5164320	Chimps bite your balls off.
5164320	5167320	Gorillas do sign language in pet kittens.
5167320	5168320	But they're fighting.
5168320	5169320	What the fuck.
5169320	5172320	One gorilla does sign language in pet kittens.
5172320	5176320	I'm sure if they bothered to teach others they'd catch on.
5180320	5183320	What about this if a human is fighting a chimp side with the human thing.
5183320	5187320	I feel like that's misguided in a lot of circumstances.
5187320	5188320	What do you mean?
5188320	5192320	I mean there's a lot of like there's like a zookeeper looking human.
5192320	5194320	And he's got a pitchfork and he's fighting with the chimp.
5194320	5196320	And you got to side with the chimp sometimes you know.
5196320	5198320	They're being abused maybe.
5198320	5199320	Oh yeah.
5199320	5200320	Oh yeah you're right.
5200320	5201320	Season.
5201320	5203320	Yeah if it was like if they were dropped in an arena.
5203320	5204320	Sure.
5204320	5205320	I mean the human.
5205320	5206320	Yeah.
5206320	5209320	This was battle war.
5209320	5213320	I guess that's what I was picturing.
5213320	5217320	Is that the situation was happening more organically.
5217320	5221320	Like maybe in the world's strangest bar.
5221320	5223320	Just like you don't know.
5223320	5227320	Like they were playing darts for a while and then they erupted into.
5228320	5235320	You know the chimp's got a broken bottle and the guy's like saying I call the cab and Mike you always do this.
5235320	5240320	Separate them but ultimately like we got to be for humans right.
5240320	5243320	I'm saying we got to be to the closest to our genetic.
5243320	5244320	Yeah.
5244320	5249320	And then once you have your shit together as a species then you then you go OK.
5249320	5254320	Now we'll start dipping and dapping and don't know what's happening.
5254320	5256320	Among all these other things.
5256320	5260320	Now if you're if you're in PETA stuff you're listening you're going you're fucking insane.
5260320	5269320	You wouldn't say retarded probably because if you're in PETA you're probably more progressive and your vocabulary is probably not as crass and my sisters retarded.
5269320	5270320	So fuck you.
5273320	5276320	But I just mean like we got it.
5276320	5279320	Here's what I'm saying.
5279320	5281320	There's homeless people.
5281320	5283320	Fuck giraffes.
5283320	5285320	That's all I'm saying.
5286320	5288320	Until there's no homeless people.
5288320	5289320	Fuck giraffes.
5289320	5293320	I don't care how long their necks get.
5293320	5296320	They're just horses with long necks.
5296320	5298320	I don't.
5298320	5299320	I don't.
5299320	5300320	I'm not saying Spencer's right.
5300320	5304320	If you walk into a bar there's a guy whipping a giraffe.
5304320	5309320	Maybe tell your friend with the whip to like OK you've had too many.
5309320	5310320	He's not worth it.
5310320	5311320	That's what I'd say.
5311320	5314320	He's not worth it Tony.
5314320	5316320	He's just a giraffe.
5316320	5318320	I don't even know how he got in here.
5318320	5320320	He must have been lower in.
5320320	5324320	This bar has the highest ceiling I've ever been in.
5324320	5325320	All right.
5325320	5326320	OK.
5326320	5327320	So we should we should play.
5327320	5329320	Let's get my character sheets.
5329320	5330320	So here's how it works Paula.
5330320	5331320	You get these sheets.
5331320	5333320	They have scribbles all over them.
5333320	5334320	We were drunk.
5334320	5335320	We look at them.
5335320	5337320	We don't know what we're doing.
5337320	5341320	If you see something on there that's like it says I have shoes you can say.
5341320	5346320	Spencer I'll generally like tell you like if you want to do something now you can do something.
5346320	5352320	Sometimes that he forgets but here it passes your dignity SARS guard.
5352320	5354320	You are a paladin.
5354320	5356320	You're for truth truth and justice.
5356320	5362320	And you'll probably want to take the top two Dave and pass the next to Ryan.
5362320	5366320	I think I messed up the order when the paper look OK to me.
5366320	5370320	Just left hand to Ryan.
5370320	5371320	It's like Twister.
5371320	5372320	Thanks Spencer.
5372320	5373320	Yeah.
5373320	5376320	Master.
5376320	5377320	What?
5377320	5379320	I'm a master.
5379320	5380320	I'll call you.
5380320	5381320	I'll call you master.
5381320	5383320	Please do.
5383320	5384320	I touched the ice.
5384320	5388320	I touched all the ice.
5388320	5389320	I don't have time to fuck around.
5389320	5390320	I'm touching all the ice.
5390320	5391320	Is that bad to touch the ice?
5391320	5392320	Yeah.
5392320	5393320	It's unhygienic.
5393320	5396320	I mean the alcohol take care of that probably right.
5396320	5397320	Yeah.
5397320	5398320	I don't know if that's scientifically accurate.
5398320	5400320	It sounds good though.
5400320	5403320	I don't think I'm going to get music probably but I should.
5403320	5404320	You got music.
5404320	5405320	Oh shit.
5405320	5407320	Well I mean whatever.
5407320	5409320	I touched all the ice.
5409320	5411320	You took all the ice.
5411320	5412320	Ice?
5412320	5414320	I don't know if these guys are ready.
5414320	5415320	Oh we could use some ice.
5415320	5416320	Dancing around.
5416320	5418320	If I've learned anything edit this part out.
5418320	5420320	Let us get our drinks.
5420320	5423320	That's what I was thinking.
5423320	5427320	So do you guys see that sports thing?
5427320	5428320	Oh yeah.
5428320	5429320	Two points right.
5429320	5430320	Two points.
5430320	5432320	I didn't think they were going to get those points but then.
5432320	5433320	Two of them.
5433320	5434320	Yeah.
5434320	5435320	Right there.
5435320	5436320	Plain as day.
5436320	5437320	Oh man.
5437320	5438320	This is like a sports corner.
5438320	5440320	I'm stealing your bit Harmon.
5440320	5441320	Steal it.
5441320	5445320	This is the least enthusiastic sports corner.
5445320	5446320	Hit it.
5446320	5447320	All right.
5447320	5448320	So are we good then?
5448320	5449320	I mean.
5449320	5450320	Yep.
5450320	5451320	Are we all.
5451320	5453320	Let me turn on my iPad.
5453320	5455320	I don't know what the fuck's wrong with me you guys.
5455320	5456320	I'm sorry.
5456320	5457320	I am sick.
5457320	5458320	I'm just sick.
5458320	5463320	I always I always cool off by nine thirty seven.
5463320	5466320	Last time on Harmon town.
5466320	5472320	Our heroes had reunited outside after leaving Father Tinder to inform Mrs.
5472320	5476320	Darmvon of her husband's untimely demise.
5476320	5481320	The gang was approached by Spizwad the gnome and the gnome.
5481320	5482320	Oh yes.
5482320	5487320	And the gnome offered them a place to stay up in his tower.
5487320	5490320	And the group decided they needed to take.
5490320	5494320	There the group decided that they needed to break into Father's Tinder's house.
5494320	5495320	Jesus Christ.
5495320	5499320	To look for clues and steal his stuff.
5499320	5504320	Spizbulb gave them a bundle of cloth and they departed while infiltrating the house.
5504320	5509320	Quark heard a noise and rushed upstairs to see a small ninja attacking Father Tinder
5509320	5511320	before escaping.
5511320	5515820	After tripping and falling on his blade trying to apprehend the assailant Quark was pissed
5515820	5522320	and sexually assaulted the beaten bloody old priest while Sharpie gave chase pursuing the
5522320	5523320	assassin.
5523320	5528320	Dignity Sars guard heard the commotion and discovered Quark sodomy removing the raging
5528320	5530820	barbarian and locking him in a closet.
5530820	5536040	Sharpie tracked the ninja to Darmvon's house which was ruined by magic.
5536040	5540720	Inside he cornered the offender who revealed himself to be Spizbulb the friendly gnome
5540720	5541720	from before.
5541720	5542720	Unbelievable.
5542720	5548480	Sharpie attacked but Spizbulb seemed to avoid all harm with a magical barrier.
5548480	5555160	Sharpie was outmatched as dignity ran off to aid our heroes Quark stood swearing revenge
5555160	5557520	on the paladin who stopped him.
5557520	5562800	But could our heroes pull it together to fight off a super powered Spizbulb or would they
5562800	5565280	all perish alone?
5565280	5566960	Like me.
5566960	5567960	Find out.
5567960	5580240	Oh my god what the hell was that some Hunter S Thompson introduction sounded like it went
5580240	5588440	with the music slipped a little tragedy in there Jesus I don't know if we can play I'm
5588440	5596520	just gonna take you somewhere I'll just role play up some happiness yeah so I saw I saw

5784440	5792920	manages to cast whatever he's casting so he waves his arms magically and you see four shining pillars
5792920	5799240	of force energy looking kind of like great columns almost as large and as heavy as stone pillars and
5799240	5805000	they they launch towards you kind of slowly they're easy to dodge but let's see if you do

5871640	5877400	force energy it's like some sort of shield your hands burn as electricity dissipates across this
5877400	5887000	shield as spiz bulb laughs he's like you can't touch me a white barrier kind of appears in
5887000	5891640	front of him and shivers out of existence fuck this guy what's this what's this guy's problem

6385160	6389080	yeah what is this shit that he gave you you got something wrapped in a black cloth or something
6390280	6396360	i'll unwrap it and i'll use it against this guy you unwrap the black sackcloth and it looks uh
6396360	6403560	black like a void it looks like a hole you're holding a hole in your hand all right it's a hole
6403640	6409560	i'm gonna throw it at him you throw it at him and it hits him like uh like a blanket and it just
6409560	6414200	kind of falls onto the floor like he got hit by a blanket that then fell on the floor
6417000	6421560	somebody push him in it's a it's a portable hole you hear you hear the slow
6421560	6428440	whirrings of machinery coming from inside the hole on the floor well can i can i push him in
6428440	6435800	uh let's i'll say let's try it you try to push him in and you do
6441320	6446440	that feels good well wait a minute what happened to him when he fell in the hole i guess he falls
6446440	6451560	he falls about four feet and uh you see his feet they could they're still sticking out of the hole
6451560	6457320	when he hits bottom and he he pulls himself to his feet what do you mean like the hole is four feet
6457320	6462760	yeah it's like it's like he's in a waiting pool maybe what about the machine somebody grab the
6462760	6468840	grab the fucking grab the hole grab it and fucking wad it up can i close it up can i close it up yeah
6468840	6474840	yeah there was whirring machinery though in that yeah we'll figure that out later trying to trying
6474840	6479160	to pull up the hole from the ground you trip and fall into the hole with father tinder
6481080	6486200	just because you said that no it's because i rolled a one well yeah because i said it those
6486280	6487480	whole thing is because i said it
6490760	6494840	i just say stuff up he's got a point what did you think in your head if i roll this number
6494840	6498760	yeah that's probably all this it's rules there's rules what are you neo you're gonna like decode
6498760	6505720	the fucking reality but yeah in this in this portable hole you can see what looks like just
6505720	6514200	a small wicker basket um and a slowly inflating balloon what is it a helium balloon uh it's it's
6514280	6517240	it looks like it i mean you can't tell by eyeballing the gas
6521240	6524680	it it seems like something that definitely requires explaining
6525480	6531080	so i'm in the hole this guy's in the hole a wicker basket and a balloon and then machine sounds
6531080	6540680	yeah oh my god yeah can i ask what's going on to who i don't know to the camera like you're
6540840	6545880	like you're a flinch stones animal give like a john krasinski look to the camera
6547720	6553400	it's like a it cuts to a talking head of you later going i didn't know what was going on
6554280	6557720	they wanted to be in the hole i guess i got in the hole i don't know where is this fizz gig guy
6557720	6561720	who is he he's in the hole with you you guys are in the hole together what's he doing is he in the
6561720	6566520	basket is the balloon bouncing on his head i mean technically speaking a lot of stuff is happening
6566520	6572680	at the same time well when i get a move i fucking fold that hole up like a napkin i'm still in it
6573560	6581000	i get out of the hole i get out of the hole all right well it's not your turn but you try to fold
6581000	6586040	up the hole but father tinder holds the edges of the hole down and it doesn't get picked up
6586040	6592840	completely it's a real it's a real thing i can't headbutt him uh well i guess you could try sure
6593640	6596040	headbutt
6597400	6603800	scotch kiss you head button right in the head and he gets a bloody nose top of the head hardest part
6603800	6610440	of the body brian dennehy penitentiary you deal three damage to him
6611960	6615640	it's unarmed combat you're a wizard but also he lets go of the edge of the hole because it hurts
6615640	6624040	his nose no no he's tough all right he's tough yeah and he's tough he leaps out of the hole and
6624040	6632520	he's like you guys you broke through my barrier but it'll never happen again uh i broke your nose
6634280	6637320	you guys broke through my nose but it'll never happen again
6639160	6645080	he starts waving his hands around creating creating a large blob of white of white force
6645080	6650760	energy it looks like creamy rich semen no
6656120	6657720	just like dad used to make
6667160	6669640	but then stopped when the city asked him to
6670600	6680280	he he hurls it towards you it's like multiple migs it slows it slows it slowly it rolls towards
6680280	6685800	you through the air and you try to dodge but somehow it reaches out with weird pseudopods
6685800	6692120	and grabs you guys and you don't save successfully even though this is flat don't worry don't worry
6692120	6703320	about that all right everybody takes 15 damage as burning searing force energy grabs you by the
6703320	6710920	legs and pulls you to the ground this wait what the what pulls us the semen cloud yeah cloud it's
6710920	6716280	more of like a semen amoeba does it look like that shit in like donnie darko where it's like
6716280	6723080	that capri sun alex mac stuff that like comes out out of people that's what it is or is it more
6723080	6731720	glowy so it's like a creamy white glowy donnie darko capri sun and it's going slow but like can
6731720	6738360	i duck well you tried but somehow it lashed out and hit you anyway so it like starts moving fast
6738360	6741960	when i start ducking i just want to make sure i know how i'm being dealt all these fucking
6742840	6748840	points it's i guess it's not moving that fast but and yet you're just unable to dodge really
6748840	6753880	like i'm so impressed by it's like like i've never even though i'm in this world i've never
6753880	6758120	seen anything like it before i think you're just where we were maybe treating it too casually and
6758120	6762600	then you just realized too late maybe like maybe it's like the first time i saw donnie darko and
6762600	6769320	actually thought it was good it was like blinded by it just because of the soundtrack yeah it is
6769880	6776680	oh wow yeah i do think it's kind of funny people run in circles very very mad world i get it okay
6776680	6783640	i just wanted to know thanks thank you master don't you master what's up is he so waving his
6783640	6791400	hands around uh he stopped that after you guys got hit by his attack uh okay so he stopped waving his
6791400	6800760	hands once the semen was generated is he now gonna take a nap because i say we get him while
6800760	6808440	he's napping i'm basing this on my spellcraft knowledge like that spell may have drained him
6808440	6813080	yeah this is like a this is a semen cloud we could hit him during his refractory period
6813320	6823880	yeah tell me when that is because i got something for yeah is is he 18 or he's that we have seven
6823880	6832040	minutes he's an old guy he's an old all right good so we have 48 minutes okay good uh anyways
