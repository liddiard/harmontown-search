0	22280	Here ye, here ye, Harmon Town is now officially in session.
22280	27200	Welcome everybody to the Nerd Mel Theater in Hollywood, California.
27200	30560	Thank you for joining us in podcast land.
30560	42920	Won't you please join me in exalting the mayor of Harmon Town, Mr. Dan Harmon.
42920	43920	It's very kind of you.
43920	46480	You're a very spirited crowd.
46480	49920	I like the feeling of this constituency tonight.
49920	50920	You're good people.
50920	59800	Back to the line tonight, figuratively and literally, talking to you, I don't want to
59800	62960	get on a lot of tangents tonight.
62960	65480	It's not a thing that we like to do here.
65480	68960	I try, I make it a goal to be directing to the point.
68960	73240	Focus is the hallmark of Harmon Town.
73240	75740	Focus is job one.
75740	82660	We make focus at Harmon Town the way they make chocolate things in the Keebler Valley.
82660	84180	And by the way, Dan, I feel like-
84180	85180	You know what?
85180	86180	They lived in a tree.
86180	88740	Dan, Dan, don't plug other products right now.
88740	91700	I forgot to mention, tonight's show brought to you by Nike.
91700	93940	You know what?
93940	95660	Slight change in tactic, okay?
95660	97420	Bear with us, okay?
97420	98860	We're not caving.
98860	101460	Tonight's show is brought to you by Nike, right?
101460	102460	Nike.
102460	103460	Yeah.
103460	104460	Mm-hmm.
104460	105460	Here's what we figured out.
106180	108180	We didn't want anything to do with us.
108180	109180	Also-
109180	110180	Fuck Adidas.
110180	111180	Nike.
111180	113580	Adidas had, what, three weeks?
113580	114580	Four weeks?
114580	115580	Yeah.
115580	116580	They lived high on the hog.
116580	121340	Adidas was a collateral benefit of our anti-Nike campaign, our hostage campaign to get Nike
121340	125420	to pay us to stop advertising Adidas.
125420	127580	We're refining our technique as we go.
127580	131580	We're not, you know, Al-Qaeda didn't perfect things in a day.
131580	132580	Certainly not.
132580	133580	No.
133700	136020	It took them like 25, 30 years.
136020	139300	They probably, the first thing they blew up, you don't even know what it was, it was probably
139300	140940	a rock.
140940	142820	They blew it up, though.
142820	143860	They moved along.
143860	145020	They blew up a car net.
145020	150300	But Dan, do you know that the official shoe of Al-Qaeda is the Nike Mercurial soccer cleat?
150300	151300	Interesting.
151300	152300	Tell me more.
152300	158260	Fusing explosive speed with eye-catching style, the Nike Mercurial Vapor 8 gives the fastest
158260	161100	Al-Qaeda members the lethal edge.
161100	163100	Interesting, Nike.
163620	167020	Care to pony up, you fucking stingy cocksuckers?
167020	168540	No, no, no, no, no, no.
168540	169540	We like them now.
169540	170540	Oh, no, no.
170540	171540	We like them.
171540	173140	We just happen to mention Al-Qaeda like it's mustard.
173140	174380	Right.
174380	179300	And we're proudly brought to you by Nike until such time as they choose to pay up.
179300	182660	Also, if anybody from Puma is listening, you're next, motherfuckers.
182660	183660	Yeah.
183660	184660	Take it easy.
184660	189260	It's a new advertising world, new paradigm.
189260	190660	The Nike Mercurial soccer thing.
190660	191860	I walked the line tonight.
191860	192860	I did a new thing.
192940	197180	Usually, we get questions that you've heard if you're listening in podcast world or you're
197180	198180	out here.
198180	199180	You know how that goes.
199180	200820	Did you walk the line in the Johnny Cash sense?
200820	201820	That's what I'm saying.
201820	203460	I did it figuratively and literally.
203460	210500	I definitely walked the line between sobriety and drunkenness.
210500	216740	And I also walked the actual physical line in the comic book shop and met a lot of people.
216740	222300	And my goal, just so you understand what I'm trying to do, it's I'm trying to connect
222300	224980	with you guys.
224980	230340	I started walking the line and I used questions initially as an excuse because I wanted to
230340	236660	talk to people and I wanted to kind of Jon Stewart you.
236660	238820	He starts the Daily Show.
238820	242420	If you tune into the Daily Show, the first thing that happens is he goes, hmm, I forgot
242420	243580	my kazoo.
243580	248300	And everyone cracks up because he shared some joke with them before the show.
248300	250740	There's a bond between performer and audience.
250860	253580	I want that.
253580	255380	Do you feel that you achieved that tonight?
255380	256380	No.
256380	259860	I think that what happens is I put people off still.
259860	261860	But I'm going to keep doing it.
261860	262860	I saw you.
262860	266980	You're walking around with a vodka in your hand and a mayorial sash on.
266980	267980	Yeah.
267980	270020	And so I was asking people, like, how's it going?
270020	273940	And you know, people shrink away.
273940	280700	You can feel them being repelled by what I have decided is my Asperger's having diagnosed
280700	287820	myself with an online quiz, which is a, you know, a big salute to everyone who professionally
287820	288820	studies this stuff.
288820	293420	I just decided from an online quiz, I have Asperger's because it's fashionable.
293420	301940	But I feel like I'm an off put it was any I just just just just just just lightly applaud.
301940	303180	I swear I won't even look.
303180	304180	I won't.
304180	305180	I won't.
305180	306180	I won't look.
306180	308740	Just lately applaud if you were put off by me in line tonight.
308740	309740	Oh, oh.
310180	312180	Oh, OK.
312180	313180	Who was that?
313180	314180	Who was it?
314180	315180	You.
315180	316180	You saw it.
316180	317180	Auntie.
317180	318180	Auntie.
318180	319180	Oh, your auntie.
319180	320180	Is that your friend?
320180	321180	Jennifer.
321180	324660	Were you but were you just comedically clapping or were you really put off by me?
324660	326660	I was surprised.
326660	331260	You were surprised that I was out there like I'm usually here, but I looked in the left
331260	332260	and you were there.
332260	333260	I wasn't ready.
333260	334260	It scared you.
334260	335260	Right.
335260	336260	Yeah.
336260	337260	Because yeah, it's weird.
337260	338260	Yeah.
338300	342780	You read about me getting fired on a blog and then I'm next to you like, oh, did you
342780	343780	have a good time tonight?
343780	344780	Oh.
344780	345780	All right.
345780	346780	Well, that doesn't count.
346780	349780	That's just you being fascinated by my majesty.
349780	353580	You were saying that you were just on a trip to San Francisco and you said everywhere you
353580	356700	went that people were recognizing.
356700	358780	Thank you for calling me out on that, Jeff.
358780	361180	That wasn't a private conversation at all.
361180	362180	Yes.
362180	363580	In point of fact, I went to San Francisco.
363580	364860	What do you mean private conversation?
364860	368100	You put a sharpie in your butt in the last show.
368100	370140	They don't know that as in broadcast yet.
370140	371140	Spoilers.
371140	372140	Yes.
372140	373140	Okay.
373140	377340	So this is a very strange, fascinating, magical and I know fleeting time from it.
377340	378540	It's very, very odd.
378540	383420	I'm not an actor or anything, an athlete or anything.
383420	388620	I went to San Francisco and Los Angeles, you kind of, you expect it.
388620	389620	It's an industry town.
389620	395780	So everyone's an editor or a gaffer or a boom operator or an aspiring writer.
395780	400820	And so you're like, okay, I'm in the capital, I'm in the epicenter of this stuff.
400820	408380	And also I'm at the epicenter chronologically of my Q rating because I was infamously, publicly
408380	412900	kind of a crucified slash self-crucified, whatever you call it.
412900	415300	You were Chevy Chase's girlfriend for me.
415300	416300	Yeah, exactly.
416300	421220	It was a very low rent Charlie Sheen, as I've said, on a very low scale.
421220	424660	And so it's like, yeah, I go to three bars and the two people recognize me.
424660	427780	It's like an 85% rate of people.
427780	430380	I went to San Francisco fucking everywhere, man.
430380	435500	I went to like Exploratorium Museum and then some guy would come up and go like, hey, I'm
435500	436500	a big fan.
436500	437500	Hey, that's fantastic.
437500	438500	Thank you.
438500	441580	And then like you look on the Twitter and people go, hey, come to the thing and I'd go to the
441580	444900	thing and then another guy'd come up and go like, hey, can I buy you a drink?
444900	446580	It was pretty amazing.
446580	451300	Anywhere that I didn't go, if I went to a place where somebody didn't explicitly come
451300	455700	up to me and say, hey, thank you, I love what you did, I would read on Twitter later
455700	460180	some guy would go, holy shit, Dan Harmon just bought an ice cream cone here.
460180	462580	It was like really a hundred percent.
462580	465420	I don't know what, it matters, nothing.
465420	468380	The only thing that's going to happen is it's going to stop in a month and I'm going to,
468380	473420	I don't know what I'll do, I'll hang myself while I'm jerking off.
473420	476420	Do you enjoy that experience of being recognized?
476420	480620	I certainly have no problem with it.
480620	486860	If you see me in public and you're thinking for a second about whether or not you should
486860	492500	bound up to me and rub my head and say, I love you, go for it.
492500	497620	I suffer no illusions about, like I'm going to be 50 muttering into a drink that that
497620	498620	used to happen.
498620	501820	Go double rub my head.
501820	503980	Do me a big favor.
503980	504980	That's no problem.
504980	509120	The big question is though, is it changing my brain chemistry?
509120	513560	Do I want it to happen or do I care if it stops?
513560	514560	And at that I don't know about.
514560	515560	I don't know.
515560	525080	I like to think that I'm a pretty sensible guy, that that's just an oddity.
525080	527200	This is the least charismatic thing anyone could ever talk about.
527200	528200	I'm done.
528200	529200	I'm finished.
529200	530200	I'm out.
530200	531200	That's the whole thing.
531200	533600	I'll talk about it sometime when I'm a little more sober.
533600	537760	Wait, have you been drinking today, Dan?
537760	542480	Because if I find out that you have been drinking with me all day long, I'll be very
542480	543480	disappointed.
543480	544480	All right.
544480	545480	Well, we got on a little bit of a tangent.
545480	546480	What were we talking about?
546480	548160	You were talking about making her uncomfortable.
548160	550200	Oh, well, yeah, but I really didn't.
550200	551200	I just amazed you.
551200	552200	Right.
552200	553800	I was like, holy shit, it's Batman.
553800	554800	Okay.
554800	555800	No, nobody thought.
555800	556800	So I didn't put anybody off.
556800	560320	But I have a lot of social anxiety, so just so you know, I go down the line.
560320	563680	What I'm trying to do is I'm, because I don't believe in therapy, so I'm going down the
563680	566400	line and I'm actually experimenting with human contact.
567120	571000	I'm not talking down to you guys or doing some kind of gimmicky thing.
571000	576120	I'm actually trying to, you're the only people that I meet outside of the three friends that
576120	577120	I have.
577120	578720	This is a weekly thing that we do now.
578720	581960	So don't abuse it or anything.
581960	585680	You're closer to N.T. than, he's like number eight in your friend.
585680	586680	Yeah.
586680	587680	Yeah.
587680	589680	N.T., I know N.T. more than I know my uncles.
589680	590680	Certainly.
591440	595080	Certainly, if N.T. was going to get hit by a car and the only way to save him was to
595080	601560	shove my uncle in without hesitation.
601560	602560	What a hero.
602560	603560	Yeah.
603560	606600	Especially if I could shove N.T. into one of my daughters just to prove that I was a
606600	609280	white liberal.
609280	610280	Fucker N.T.
610280	611280	Fucker.
611280	614840	N.T.'s black, so just for podcast land.
614840	615840	N.T.
615840	616840	N.T. is a...
616840	618760	Those listening at home, stop your stopwatches.
618760	621000	That's the first race mentioned to me.
621000	622840	We got to race.
622840	623840	We made it to race.
623840	627880	But Dan, that's 30 or 40 seconds later than normal.
627880	629800	You're getting there.
629800	633320	In four years we might do a whole show where you don't mention race.
633320	636400	And I think that day our souls will die a little bit.
636400	642040	I think I was born, I'm starting to realize I was sent here to Earth to obsess about race
642040	646040	and racism.
646040	650200	Speaking of which, Steve Harvey is hosting Family Feud now?
650200	651200	For a long time.
651200	655040	For quite some time, I believe.
655040	660000	I was in a hotel room, so this is the first I've heard of it.
660000	666360	Erin has some weird OCD neurosis where she can't get dressed in a hotel room unless the
666360	670800	television is on.
670800	676000	It's only in a hotel room with Erin that I'm actually subjected to normal television signals
676360	678440	That's the only time I watch SportsCenter for some reason.
678440	679440	It's in a hotel.
679440	681440	I go, I'll find out what NASCAR is doing.
681440	686000	Yeah, so she's going to put on her skirt and her shirts or whatever you call them.
686000	687000	Skirting shirts.
687000	688000	Yeah.
688000	690680	And so we're watching Family Feud.
690680	695960	Steve Harvey, whatever, I'm disappointed in you.
695960	696960	Aim higher, Steve.
696960	699600	I don't even know you that well.
699600	700600	How did he let you down?
700600	702920	Well, by being on Family Feud.
703160	708920	I just noticed this show is a celebration of mediocrity, like beyond any, like really,
708920	710720	no one can argue with that.
710720	716520	They literally, in front of your family, they stand you up and they ask you what you think
716520	722680	normal people said when they said something.
722680	725320	What makes Miss Piggy different from a real pig?
725320	731040	The person that slams the buzzer down first and goes, she has hair!
731040	734600	They win if the most people think like them.
734600	735600	They win.
735600	740560	And the person who has the slightest fucking potential to not connect dots that are right
740560	746480	next to each other, just on the off chance Picasso wandered in with his family to Family
746480	750520	Feud, he's going to be burnt to the fucking stake on this show.
750520	752520	That's what it's about.
752520	756840	You will be labeled as the reason you let your family down.
756840	759520	You think differently.
759520	760680	You're an asshole.
760680	765040	You're a psycho.
765040	767760	What do you think everyone said when they eat a brownie?
767760	768760	Yummy.
768760	769760	You win.
769760	770760	You win.
770760	771760	What were you going to say, asshole?
771760	772760	Flower.
772760	773760	Fuck you.
773760	774760	Get out of here.
774760	775760	Who the fuck are you?
775760	776760	What the fuck's with you?
776760	778320	Do you have fungus in your brain?
778320	779320	Get away.
779320	787240	It's like on the playground, it's like family Feud.
787240	790120	Family Feud, the title, that's a beautiful idea.
790120	794760	Get families against each other for sure.
794760	799040	Make it tribal and go, okay, what makes the Harmans different from the Johnsons?
799040	800600	The Harmans rule.
800600	801600	Why do we rule?
801600	802920	I don't know.
802920	806840	Because we have our own language.
806840	812160	We should win if we're able to communicate with each other better and we're weirder.
812160	813520	I don't know how to design that game.
813520	817040	It's not my job to make game shows.
817040	819400	I just know that Family Feud is definitely a celebration.
819400	821000	What's your beef with Steve Harvey, though?
821000	822000	Well he's participating.
822000	824480	What are you talking about?
824480	826080	What's my beef with anybody that hosts that show?
826080	828280	The last guy killed himself, didn't he?
828280	830880	Why do you think?
830880	834320	Because he was, I'm sure if there was a note, I'm sure it was like I'm tired of being a
834320	838720	cog in a human grinder.
838720	843600	I can't take it, like the karmic energy has come back out from my asshole and into my
843600	845960	mouth and it's like I'm poltergeist-ing myself.
845960	846960	I want to die.
846960	848160	Wait, Richard Dawson killed himself?
848160	849720	No, no, the guy that replaced him.
849720	853960	Richard Dawson just died of grief, I'm sure.
853960	854960	Rick Holmes?
854960	855960	Ray Combs.
855960	856960	Ray Combs.
856960	862120	Yeah, Richard Dawson just was able to sustain that toxin going through his body.
862120	866120	Well because he subverted the show by being just a fucking fantastic alcoholic.
866120	868560	Very congenial, very congenial, very drunk.
868560	871320	He was purple drunk.
871320	873960	His skin took on Hughes.
873960	877600	He was just like nuclear sunset, orange, purple.
877600	878600	He was awesome.
878600	879600	He was 70s drunk.
879600	880600	Yeah.
880600	882480	Patton Oswalt has a whole routine about it.
882480	886960	If you haven't heard of it, I'm sure most of you had, Patton Oswalt is the final word
886960	889560	on Richard Dawson's beautiful drunkenness.
889560	892400	So then he got replaced by that guy, but that guy, I think he killed himself, didn't
892400	893400	he?
893400	894400	Is that true?
894400	895400	What's your name, sir?
895400	896400	Sean Combs.
896400	901680	Sean in our front row is the historian of Family Feud.
901680	904200	Oh, is that, wait, I thought that was Snap the Jap for a second.
904200	905200	It is, okay.
905200	907280	See, the thing is you can't call yourself Snap the Jap.
907280	910520	I can't tell you're Asian.
910520	912360	You're not Asian enough that you go, oh, it's Snap the Jap.
912360	913800	It's a terrible name.
913800	914800	Change your name.
914800	916440	His Twitter name is Snap the Jap.
916440	920160	I think as we go along, we're going to start amassing a full cast of characters.
920160	923680	At some point, the entire audience will be people that we know by first name.
923680	925200	We have to sit them all over there.
925200	928000	It'll be like Hollywood Squares.
928000	929000	Yeah.
929000	934440	Well, that was a dead end.
934440	936920	I just think that Family Feud should be outlawed.
936920	941880	I don't think Dungeons and Dragons should be, because it's an exploration of the mind,
941880	945440	and the most exciting thing that's going to happen tonight is Spencer's going to come
945440	949960	up and we're going to start our first Dungeons and Dragons adventure.
949960	956640	For those of you who are just joining us for the first time, three episodes ago, we decided
956640	957920	to play Dungeons and Dragons.
957920	962080	Two weeks ago, we brought up a dungeon master, Spencer.
962080	966320	Last week, he created our characters for us, and now we're going to bring up Spencer, our
966320	967320	dungeon master.
967320	968320	Are you ready, Spencer?
968320	969320	Does this thing work?
969320	970320	Yeah.
970320	971320	Yeah.
971320	972320	You want me over there?
972320	973320	Yeah.
973320	974320	Are you comfortable?
974320	975320	You need a tabletop, right?
975320	976320	Yeah.
976320	977320	Roll dice on it.
977320	978320	Yeah.
978320	979320	Yeah.
979320	980320	Yeah.
980320	992320	Why don't we talk to him up here for a second, and then we'll send him off to the cornfield.
993320	996320	Well, first I want Spencer and the audience to understand that anything that goes wrong
996320	1001400	tonight, because I don't think this has ever been attempted, a live Dungeons and Dragons-ing
1001400	1002400	on a podcast.
1002400	1005800	And there might be a very good reason for that.
1005800	1008920	If that turns out to be the case, it's all the heats on me, man.
1008920	1010840	This is not, Spencer's a stand-up guy.
1010840	1011840	He had volunteered.
1011840	1015560	He shot his hand up when we asked if there's a dungeon master in the audience.
1015560	1017360	He has leapt to this duty.
1017360	1020440	If this goes wrong, it's not because there's anything wrong with Spencer.
1020440	1024880	I just want to make sure that's clear, because I'm sure we all become dungeon masters, because
1024880	1030720	we don't want something to be wrong with us that we deeply fear is.
1030720	1033360	So I don't want to be, I don't want to push you further into psychosis.
1033360	1036760	The dungeons truly hide my hurts and salt pains.
1036760	1041240	All right.
1041240	1043520	I'm back in high school already.
1043520	1046560	So do you think you're comfortable over there?
1046560	1049320	Do you want that black linen off of the table?
1049320	1050320	Is that not dice amenable?
1050320	1051320	It'll be fine.
1051320	1052320	All right.
1052320	1053320	You'll be fine.
1053320	1054320	Okay.
1054320	1057040	Spencer, I have a question for you.
1057040	1062440	How old were you when you first DM'd, when you first mastered a dungeon?
1062440	1066840	Back before I knew what Dungeons and Dragons is, we used to just play pretend, you know?
1066840	1070320	But we do the same basic things, and then someone's like, hey, have you heard of Dungeons
1070320	1071320	and Dragons?
1071320	1072320	And we were like, wow.
1072320	1073320	Let's make this more complicated.
1073320	1074320	Yeah, yeah.
1074320	1075320	So you were four.
1075320	1076320	All right.
1077320	1079320	Oh, I guess I was in, like, fourth grade.
1079320	1080320	I don't know what age that is.
1080320	1081320	Fantastic.
1081320	1085320	I do remember, funny, I remember being in grade school, and I remember there was this
1085320	1087320	kid, god damn it, what was his name?
1087320	1091320	I'll never remember it, but I wish I could give him props, because he really, you just
1091320	1094320	made me realize that it starts so much earlier.
1094320	1098320	Like, all kids play make believe, all kids play hot lava, there's a dinosaur and all
1098320	1099320	this stuff.
1099320	1103320	But then some kids start playing football, and then there's other kids that are like,
1103320	1105320	this hot lava just started getting good.
1108320	1114320	And I remember being on the playground and playing hot lava to the fucking hilt with
1114320	1115320	two kids.
1115320	1118320	One kid's name was Sean Malarkey, which sounds like a fake name.
1118320	1119320	Sean Malarkey!
1119320	1121320	Because his name literally means fake.
1121320	1123320	I would be disappointed if it was a normal name.
1123320	1126320	Your friend's names are absolutely terrible.
1126320	1130320	And then there was another kid, god damn it, was like, ah, god damn it.
1131320	1132320	I think it was Armenian.
1133320	1134320	Fuzz in the gas patch.
1134320	1138320	It doesn't matter, but I only want to think of it, because I'd like to think that he'd
1138320	1139320	wander into it and get props for it.
1139320	1141320	But he was the fucking best.
1141320	1147320	He would play, it was a form of hot lava called Jaws, because Jaws was popular.
1147320	1152320	There were sharks everywhere, and he would tell us where we were safe from the shark
1152320	1154320	water and where the sharks were and stuff.
1154320	1160320	And the 30 minute recess would just evaporate instantly.
1160320	1163320	You couldn't believe it.
1163320	1167320	Pulling yourself away from this world where anything was possible, and you were acting
1167320	1172320	out these adventures, and then you have to go trudge back to math class and all this
1172320	1173320	stuff.
1173320	1174320	It's like, what a bummer.
1174320	1175320	I'm going to go kill myself.
1178320	1180320	I never made that correlation, actually.
1180320	1182320	That's the beginning of Dungeons and Dragons.
1183320	1187320	You hang out with your friends, and you're improvising storytelling out on the playground.
1188320	1190320	Spencer, how do we kick this off?
1191320	1193320	I think he's probably got some setup to do, some physical stuff.
1193320	1195320	Dan has played this before, back in the olden days.
1195320	1197320	I've never played this before, really.
1197320	1202320	You're going to have to walk me through it, but also our audience and our listening audience
1202320	1203320	through it.
1203320	1208320	Basically, we're going to be telling a story, and I'm going to be making the set and coming
1208320	1210320	up with the non-player characters.
1211320	1214320	You guys are going to be acting the parts of your player characters, which are sharpie
1214320	1217320	butts a lot and cork.
1221320	1228320	Basically, how it'll go down is, you'll say you want to do something, and then you'll
1228320	1229320	roll a dice.
1229320	1231320	Or I'll roll it for you on the table, since I'm over here.
1231320	1232320	You can roll it for us.
1232320	1233320	All right, well, there you go.
1233320	1236320	Then I'll tell you if you screwed up or whatever.
1236320	1241320	Basically, he's telling us a story, but we decide what we do in the story.
1241320	1247320	Then to simulate the chaos that is life, he rolls dice and has charts and stuff that he
1247320	1249320	uses at his discretion.
1249320	1251320	He'll be asking you what you're going to do next.
1251320	1252320	You can do anything you want.
1252320	1253320	Let's get it on.
1253320	1259320	Everybody, Spencer, the beginning of our campaign.
1259320	1261320	Do campaigns have names?
1261320	1262320	Do what?
1262320	1263320	Do campaigns have names?
1263320	1264320	Is there a title for our campaign?
1264320	1266320	I'm pretty sure sometimes they do.
1266320	1267320	I didn't name this.
1267320	1270320	I thought it was just like, I don't know, just anything.
1270320	1271320	We used to have modules.
1271320	1275320	When you buy them in the store, they have titles, obviously.
1275320	1277320	But we'll let Spencer set up.
1277320	1280320	I can fill the time of him setting up.
1285320	1287320	I always forget to tell this story.
1287320	1288320	Shrob's not here tonight.
1288320	1289320	He came up.
1289320	1292320	He told a story about cleaning his butthole.
1293320	1296320	That will not soon be forgotten.
1298320	1303320	Because that was so exciting, I forgot to tell my favorite Shrob story, which is when
1303320	1307320	I was on the set of Heat Vision and Jack with him, which we co-created, so we were on the
1307320	1308320	set of this thing.
1308320	1309320	This is pre-9-11.
1309320	1312320	The sun is different.
1312320	1315320	There's no moon.
1315320	1318320	Nothing that you kids are familiar with.
1319320	1326320	We were standing on a set of a Jack Black motorcycle show that we wrote.
1326320	1330320	It says that Jack drives a motorcycle through a wall, so they're making a wall that someone
1330320	1331320	can drive through.
1331320	1334320	We're like, holy shit, we're going to get in trouble.
1334320	1340320	There's a medical guy on every TV and movie set for insurance purposes.
1340320	1346320	His job is to, obviously, if someone's finger flies off, he has to reattach it or call the
1346320	1347320	ambulance or whatever.
1347320	1354320	But because that rarely happens on a good set, the medical guy tends to hand out emergency
1354320	1358320	vitamin C powder and just shoot the shit with people.
1358320	1361320	It centers around a medical thing.
1361320	1367320	The medical guy on the set of Heat Vision and Jack was talking to me and Shrob about
1367320	1373320	Diet Coke, because Rob was headlong into a serious Diet Coke addiction.
1373320	1376320	He's like, man, I really got to stop drinking so much Diet Coke.
1376320	1377320	I got to stop.
1377320	1382320	The medical guy said, and Rob's like, yeah, because it makes me so jittery and stuff.
1382320	1389320	The medical guy says, yeah, well, also, just so you know, it makes your dick soft.
1389320	1391320	Rob had this weird reaction on his face.
1391320	1394320	It didn't fit what he was hearing.
1394320	1400320	It looked like intrigue instead of repulsion or dismissal.
1400320	1403320	He said, really?
1403320	1405320	Like velvet?
1405320	1411320	I was like, no, Rob.
1411320	1414320	No, it makes it not erect.
1414320	1423320	Oh, no, I thought he meant if you pour it over it.
1423320	1426320	He wasn't kidding, man.
1426320	1429320	Rob was thinking about his dick like a Ferrari.
1429320	1432320	He put a chamois on there.
1432320	1435320	They give it a sheen and make it soft to the touch.
1435320	1436320	Make it irresistible.
1436320	1439320	Baby, your dick is so soft tonight.
1439320	1443320	I dicked it in a picture of Diet Coke last night.
1443320	1446320	I thought that was amazing.
1446320	1448320	That's the price of being able to draw.
1448320	1450320	Are you sure that Rob wasn't right?
1450320	1453320	I don't know that if you pour Diet Coke over your dick, it doesn't get really soft.
1453320	1455320	I don't know.
1455320	1456320	Let's find out.
1456320	1457320	All right.
1457320	1458320	For those of you at home, I'm doing it.
1458320	1459320	Oh, it's really soft.
1459320	1462320	I don't know where that's going.
1462320	1463320	Do you want to start?
1463320	1464320	All right.
1464320	1466320	Well, we hand it over to Spencer's hands.
1466320	1469320	He's the sort of narrator of the, because we don't, yeah.
1469320	1477320	All right.
1477320	1478320	All right.
1478320	1484320	Sharpie, Butz-a-Lot, and Cork are on the road to a treasure vault known as the Trove.
1484320	1490320	A local sage named Derevan has asked you to investigate the Trove as a result of recent scrying,
1490320	1499320	having heard from beyond that a fragment of greatness is about to be revealed in this world.
1499320	1502320	The path is dirt, and it's a warm sunny day in Coldona.
1502320	1508320	Rolling hills stretch on around you, but the path ahead bends into some woods to the base of a great cliff.
1508320	1510320	Oh, shit.
1510320	1511320	Yeah.
1511320	1512320	Yeah.
1512320	1513320	See, already.
1513320	1514320	No.
1514320	1515320	It's fucking Spencer, everybody.
1515320	1516320	Right now.
1516320	1517320	Come on.
1517320	1518320	Yeah.
1518320	1523320	In an ideal universe, he's Jimmy Page.
1523320	1527320	He gets applause for his GM solo.
1527320	1529320	No.
1529320	1532320	I have a partial right now.
1532320	1535320	All right.
1535320	1538320	So we're on a path, and it's heading into a-
1538320	1539320	Yeah.
1539320	1543320	You're on path to go into the woods unless you guys want to stop or something.
1543320	1544320	Well, all right.
1544320	1545320	Can I ask a question?
1545320	1546320	Yeah.
1546320	1547320	Go for it.
1547320	1548320	Any questions.
1548320	1549320	How do we know each other?
1549320	1550320	All right.
1550320	1551320	You guys are friends.
1551320	1556320	You met on a mission to the Howling Mine, and you became friends, and you ventured together,
1556320	1560320	and you found out that you're better, and you can get paid more if you work together as a team.
1560320	1565320	We were kind of met as rivals, like Indiana Jones and Belloc.
1565320	1566320	Yeah, exactly.
1566320	1567320	All right.
1567320	1568320	And then we-
1568320	1572320	If you guys want to subscribe to the prequel someday.
1572320	1574320	What's your racing-
1574320	1576320	I'm a human wizard.
1576320	1577320	All right.
1577320	1579320	He casts spells, and he has a hawk familiar.
1579320	1580320	I have a hawk.
1580320	1586320	I guess as a known barbarian, I'm a pretty whimsical kind of- I'm an emotional guy.
1586320	1587320	Yeah, for sure.
1587320	1591320	I go into flights of fancy.
1591320	1596320	Before I go into this wood, I'd probably stop and ask this human magic user, wizard, what
1597320	1598320	he thinks is best.
1598320	1600320	Sharpie, butts a lot.
1600320	1602320	What do you think?
1602320	1608320	I would say that because I have a hawk familiar, and you tell me, Spencer, what's allowed with
1608320	1612320	these familiars, I would say, is this like a Beastmaster situation?
1612320	1616320	Can I send the hawk up to get a literal bird's eye view?
1616320	1620320	You can't read his mind, but when he comes back, you can look at him and know what he's
1620320	1621320	seeing, you know?
1621320	1622320	Really?
1622320	1623320	Yeah.
1623320	1625320	To the point where it's like I can know the terrain and-
1625320	1626320	Not quite to that extent.
1626320	1628320	It's not that smart, but yeah.
1628320	1629320	But better safe than-
1629320	1630320	Yeah.
1630320	1631320	Oh, there's a cliff.
1631320	1632320	Oh, there's some trees.
1632320	1633320	I don't know.
1633320	1634320	Or there's a giant-
1634320	1636320	If there was, I mean, I'm not going to tell you yet.
1636320	1637320	Well, no, no, I know.
1637320	1638320	But yeah, definitely.
1638320	1639320	Okay, all right.
1639320	1640320	Well, I was thinking, you know, why not send-
1640320	1641320	That's a fair question.
1641320	1643320	Let's go in the woods.
1643320	1649320	I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm spoiling for a fight.
1649320	1651320	Take it easy, Cork.
1651320	1653320	You love cigarettes and riddles.
1653320	1654320	I'm sorry.
1654320	1657320	Oh, I have a riddle for you.
1657320	1660320	Okay.
1660320	1663320	Is it about cigarettes?
1663320	1668320	What did- what did one octopus say to the other octopus?
1668320	1669320	Ink?
1669320	1671320	No, no, no.
1671320	1674320	Well, that's how they communicate.
1674320	1675320	I get mad when you know what I mean.
1675320	1678320	Easy, easy, easy.
1678320	1681320	I want to hold your hand, hand, hand, hand, hand, hand, hand, hand, hand, hand.
1681320	1682320	All right.
1682320	1686320	That makes no sense to me because there's no beetles in this universe.
1686320	1688320	To my knowledge.
1688320	1690320	No, no one's going to get jiggy with anything.
1690320	1691320	You know what?
1691320	1697320	If we didn't have so much success in the Calderon mind,
1697320	1698320	or whatever the fuck-
1698320	1700320	What did we learn, Cork?
1700320	1701320	We learned to work together.
1701320	1702320	Yeah.
1702320	1703320	All right.
1703320	1707320	So, look, an ounce of prevention, dot, dot, dot.
1707320	1708320	Right.
1708320	1709320	I'm going to send my hawk up.
1709320	1710320	What's my hawk's name?
1711320	1712320	Avenger.
1713320	1716320	Probably he's got a cooler name than I do.
1717320	1719320	The audience didn't pick it.
1719320	1720320	No, no, no, no.
1720320	1725320	I'm going to send my hacky hawk's name up into the ether and see what he-
1725320	1730320	if he comes down, see if he has any alarms about what he sees ahead of us.
1730320	1731320	You're too cautious.
1731320	1732320	You're too cautious.
1732320	1733320	Cork, listen.
1733320	1736320	My caution, as you know, has sometimes saved our necks.
1737320	1738320	The hawk returns.
1738320	1739320	All right.
1739320	1740320	You catch him on your arm.
1740320	1743320	Avenger, what see you?
1751320	1752320	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
1752320	1753320	He probably doesn't understand that.
1753320	1754320	No, no, I-
1755320	1756320	I'm sorry.
1756320	1758320	I just, I just went to heaven for a moment.
1761320	1762320	This is the whole game.
1762320	1764320	You spent your whole high school years getting laid.
1764320	1766320	Like, see what you missed?
1767320	1768320	Speakers to a gnome?
1769320	1770320	Does he?
1771320	1773320	What would be high school?
1774320	1775320	All right.
1775320	1777320	Avenger, what say you?
1778320	1786320	He said he sees four little looking people at the base of a big cliff hitting a door.
1786320	1787320	Hmm.
1788320	1792320	That sounds like there's four little people hitting the base of a-
1792320	1793320	I'm a little people.
1793320	1795320	Let's go help those little people out.
1795320	1796320	All right.
1796320	1799320	Well, it sounds like, yeah, certainly if you saw anything worse than that, we would have heard about it.
1799320	1802320	I'm gonna rush, let's rush headlong toward that door.
1804320	1808320	How, how, how would you have an eye in the distance between us and that event?
1808320	1811320	You head, head, or you rush headlong towards the door.
1811320	1812320	All right.
1812320	1813320	Just like I said.
1814320	1815320	All right.
1815320	1816320	Lesson learned.
1816320	1817320	Walk, walk, walk, walk.
1817320	1819320	Hey, uh, hey, uh, Sharpie.
1819320	1820320	Yeah.
1820320	1822320	Uh, what's red and smells like blue paint?
1823320	1824320	Red paint.
1827320	1829320	Nobody ever gets that.
1830320	1832320	All paint smells the same.
1833320	1834320	Do you need a cigarette?
1836320	1837320	Have you got one?
1837320	1838320	Jesus Christ.
1838320	1840320	I'm trying to quit.
1843320	1844320	All right.
1844320	1846320	Uh, do we do it?
1846320	1847320	How far to the-
1847320	1850320	You charge across the bend and you see a clearing.
1850320	1855320	There's the base of the cliff with the large door, just as Avenger had mentioned, and you see in front of it four goblins
1855320	1857320	trying to puzzle at how to get in.
1857320	1859320	They don't seem to notice you yet.
1859320	1860320	Goblins?
1860320	1861320	This is not cool, man.
1861320	1862320	Are they friendly?
1862320	1863320	No, no.
1863320	1864320	They're goblins.
1865320	1866320	Look.
1866320	1868320	Let's just, let's just go away.
1871320	1872320	No, I agree.
1872320	1874320	What's behind the door?
1874320	1875320	Well, we're first level.
1875320	1877320	Yeah, I don't think we should fuck with four goblins either.
1877320	1882320	I got to say though, my natural barbarian curiosity wants to know what's behind that door.
1882320	1884320	Four goblins are trying to get in.
1884320	1885320	Well, it's where we're going.
1885320	1888320	The scryer that told us to come here.
1888320	1889320	How about this?
1889320	1891320	Let me go talk to the goblins, right?
1891320	1892320	You can't talk to goblins.
1892320	1893320	I'm short.
1893320	1894320	I'm short.
1894320	1896320	They'll see me as one of their own.
1896320	1898320	There's no talking to goblins, man.
1898320	1899320	They're like monsters.
1899320	1901320	They're absolute monsters.
1901320	1904320	On the back page, they'll say the languages at the bottom.
1904320	1905320	Not that.
1905320	1906320	The other one?
1907320	1911320	Yeah, but the page behind that, towards the bottom, languages.
1911320	1912320	All right.
1912320	1913320	Do you see languages?
1913320	1914320	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1914320	1915320	Does it say goblin?
1915320	1916320	No.
1916320	1917320	What does it say?
1917320	1918320	Common gnome giant.
1918320	1919320	All right.
1919320	1920320	You don't speak goblin.
1920320	1921320	All right.
1921320	1923320	Common elvish dwarf orc under common.
1923320	1924320	Under common?
1924320	1928320	I studied it in high school, but I only remember like a few words.
1928320	1931320	You realize that goblins might speak under common.
1931320	1932320	Oh, really?
1932320	1933320	Maybe.
1933320	1939320	I also speak abyssal in case we run into James Cameron.
1940320	1945320	As background, as a guy in this world, I would know this.
1945320	1947320	I'm just asking you a common knowledge question.
1947320	1951320	Are goblins ever anything other than thuggish bastards?
1951320	1954320	Is there any point in ever talking to them?
1954320	1959320	I mean, they've been known to form societies, but generally, they cause a menace.
1959320	1960320	All right.
1960320	1962320	Well, look, I say...
1962320	1965320	I'm a plus one attacking goblinoids.
1965320	1966320	What's a goblinoid?
1966320	1967320	That's a goblin.
1967320	1968320	Or goblinoids.
1968320	1969320	Let's fuck them up, man.
1969320	1970320	Huh?
1970320	1971320	Let's just do it.
1971320	1972320	Let's fuck them up.
1972320	1973320	Let's go fuck these goblins up.
1973320	1974320	All right.
1974320	1975320	Right?
1975320	1976320	Audience, yeah.
1976320	1977320	Okay.
1977320	1978320	All right.
1978320	1981320	I feel the gods urging us on.
1981320	1982320	So here's the thing.
1982320	1983320	Wait, wait.
1983320	1984320	Don't do it yet.
1984320	1985320	Don't do it yet.
1985320	1986320	No, no, no.
1986320	1987320	I have a crossbow.
1987320	1988320	I'm good with a crossbow.
1988320	1989320	Yeah, they still haven't noticed you.
1989320	1991320	So we can take one out before you fly into a rage.
1991320	1992320	All right.
1992320	1994320	So I want to fire my crossbow at one of them.
1994320	1995320	All right.
1995320	1999320	These aren't the best shot, but let's try it.
1999320	2001320	Sharpie.
2001320	2003320	You fire a bolt loose from your crossbow.
2003320	2006320	It whizzes past a goblin and thunks in the cliffside.
2006320	2008320	Son of a bitch.
2008320	2010320	Now they know we're here.
2010320	2011320	Now they know they're here.
2011320	2014320	This is time for my catchphrase, which is...
2014320	2018320	No, sorry.
2018320	2023320	You'll hear it a lot.
2023320	2024320	Okay.
2024320	2026320	Well, fly into a rage and take them out.
2026320	2027320	I'm going to go study magic.
2027320	2031320	Spencer, what are my chances of taking on four goblins on my own?
2031320	2033320	You can run up to one and hit it.
2033320	2034320	Let's do it.
2034320	2037320	Let's fucking light this fucking firecracker and see what happens.
2037320	2039320	Launching yourself at the goblin.
2039320	2043320	You draw your sword and then a clean slice slash at him.
2043320	2045320	He rolls the dice.
2045320	2047320	You hit the goblin.
2047320	2052320	Fuck yeah!
2052320	2053320	Never had a lesson.
2053320	2055320	He is cleft in twain.
2055320	2056320	Sorry, what happened?
2056320	2057320	He is cleft in twain.
2057320	2058320	Cleft in twain?
2058320	2060320	His two halves fall probably to the floor.
2060320	2064320	All right.
2064320	2068320	I would...
2068320	2072320	I think ray of frost sounds pretty aggressive.
2072320	2073320	Yeah, for sure.
2073320	2075320	I would like to cast ray of frost.
2075320	2078320	With a magical gesture of your hand,
2078320	2082320	a ray of frost fires forth towards a goblin.
2082320	2087320	You hit the goblin.
2087320	2088320	And?
2088320	2091320	He freezes and falls and shatters into pieces.
2091320	2094320	Yeah, yeah.
2094320	2096320	Yeah, if you were to hit that first one with a crossbow,
2096320	2098320	we'd only have one dude left.
2098320	2100320	I'm practicing.
2100320	2102320	It's my B-plan.
2102320	2103320	Crossbow.
2103320	2104320	All right, it's the goblin's turn.
2104320	2108320	He's a cigarette right now, God damn it.
2108320	2109320	Goblin's turn.
2109320	2110320	Wait, wait, wait.
2110320	2111320	It's my turn?
2111320	2112320	No, it's the goblin's turn.
2112320	2114320	They whirl around and notice that two of their brethren
2114320	2116320	lie slain on the floor.
2116320	2118320	They scatter like ants.
2118320	2119320	Ooh.
2119320	2120320	Did we scare them off?
2120320	2121320	You scared them off, man.
2121320	2122320	Dude!
2122320	2124320	If you kill two of them before they turn around...
2124320	2130320	We're like the cactus bunch.
2130320	2132320	Dan and Jeff are hugging everybody.
2133320	2134320	It's a tender moment.
2138320	2141320	Spencer, I say if you'd be willing,
2141320	2143320	when you stay put kind of like the Paul Shafer
2143320	2146320	to a very nerdy Tonight Show or whatever,
2146320	2148320	David Letterman hosts.
2148320	2150320	Because we may need to come back to this
2150320	2152320	because it's already working.
2152320	2155320	Let's just talk about our buttholes for you.
2155320	2157320	Yeah, because now we're at the door
2157320	2159320	and we've sent these goblins are running, right?
2159320	2160320	Yeah, that's the case.
2160320	2162320	A little bit of a nice little Breaking Bad.
2162320	2163320	Some downtime.
2163320	2166320	AMC commercial break for our Dungeons and Dragons adventure.
2166320	2170320	We just created what can only be described as podcast history.
2170320	2173320	Yeah, no, it's podcast dynamite.
2173320	2174320	Are you kidding?
2174320	2179320	It's like if Garrison Keeler knew how to do this shit,
2179320	2181320	he would have done it.
2181320	2185320	Speaking of goblins, holy shit, think of this segue.
2185320	2187320	This is what I wanted to share with people.
2187320	2189320	Halloween is quickly approaching.
2189320	2190320	Here's the thing.
2190320	2193320	We decided we're all dressing as Jareth
2193320	2196320	from Labyrinth for Halloween.
2196320	2199320	I'm sorry I burped while telling you that.
2199320	2201320	We were watching Aaron McGathey,
2201320	2204320	Dan's girlfriend made us watch Labyrinth,
2204320	2205320	which is one of...
2205320	2207320	You could say it's your favorite movie,
2207320	2209320	or among your favorite movies.
2209320	2211320	My favorite movie of the kid growing up.
2211320	2213320	Your favorite movie growing up.
2213320	2215320	So we watched it, and I hadn't seen it in a long time.
2215320	2217320	And David Bowie, if you've never seen the movie,
2217320	2220320	if you don't recall, David Bowie has a number
2220320	2221320	of awesome costumes.
2221320	2224320	He's got big rock and roll hair,
2224320	2228320	and generally a giant cock, like a huge codpiece,
2228320	2229320	and high boots.
2229320	2231320	And he's kind of an asshole in it,
2231320	2232320	but so is everybody.
2232320	2234320	That's a movie full of bad people.
2234320	2236320	So we decided that we were all going to have
2236320	2238320	a competition on Halloween.
2238320	2240320	We were all going to dress as Jareth,
2240320	2241320	Bowie's character from Labyrinth,
2241320	2243320	and made the best Jareth win.
2243320	2247320	But we wanted, whenever our closest harm in town
2247320	2252320	is to Halloween, we invite any of you here tonight
2252320	2254320	or listening to come as Jareth,
2254320	2256320	because Dan and I certainly will be dressed as Jareth.
2256320	2257320	Yeah.
2257320	2259320	Aaron, almost, absolutely certainly.
2259320	2263320	And what we'd like to have is a nerd melt full of Jareths.
2263320	2267320	Just a bunch of Jareths, for better or for worse.
2267320	2269320	We might have a little talent show,
2269320	2270320	or a little costume contest.
2270320	2273320	And then we're going to all go to one bar together.
2273320	2277320	And we're going to take that bar over.
2277320	2282320	And my deep, abiding wish is that we go to a bar
2282320	2286320	where one guy was dressed as Jareth.
2286320	2290320	He goes, oh, you've got to be shitting me.
2290320	2294320	We would like to confuse Los Angeles.
2294320	2297320	Although we could all just go to a bar like the Roxy
2297320	2299320	or something like that, the Rainbow Room,
2299320	2300320	or something under Sunset Strip,
2300320	2303320	and they'd all just think we were in Nikki Six or some shit.
2303320	2305320	Are you feeling what I'm feeling?
2305320	2306320	D&D withdrawal.
2306320	2307320	Oh, shit.
2307320	2308320	Don't you feel that?
2308320	2311320	It's like, god damn it, that's why I was fine.
2311320	2315320	I can fairly hear the creak of that door.
2315320	2319320	As the corpses of those goblins lie rotting in the nude sun.
2319320	2321320	Spencer, we're at this door.
2321320	2325320	We sent these goblins a scattered.
2325320	2326320	So what is this door?
2326320	2327320	Can we describe this door to us?
2327320	2328320	All right, yeah.
2328320	2331320	The path ends at a bottom of a sheet rock face.
2331320	2333320	The natural rock extends upwards,
2333320	2335320	hundreds of feet to end in a cliff.
2335320	2336320	Your path is flanked by trees.
2336320	2338320	Channels are etched in the rock,
2338320	2340320	carved by ages of trickling streams,
2340320	2341320	paths down the cliffside.
2341320	2343320	But in the heat of the summer, it's all dry.
2343320	2345320	Jesus Christ, did you write that?
2345320	2347320	Yeah, that's part of the job.
2347320	2349320	Fuck you.
2349320	2350320	Yeah.
2350320	2351320	What the hell?
2351320	2354320	Set in the rock, surface is a large gold door
2354320	2355320	and a large gold arch.
2355320	2357320	Standing a good 12 feet tall,
2357320	2359320	the door lacks any handles or hinges,
2359320	2362320	but its surface is marred by scratches and cuts.
2362320	2363320	Of course.
2363320	2366320	Yeah, many, many men have been here before us
2366320	2369320	and tried in vain, just as those goblins were.
2369320	2370320	We're going to have to approach this
2370320	2375320	with the minds of sentience.
2375320	2376320	All right.
2376320	2377320	Quark, I'm going to confess.
2377320	2381320	I drank a little bit before the campaign.
2381320	2382320	I have to hang a leak.
2382320	2384320	Let's get inside.
2384320	2387320	Well, I don't think it's that easy, Quark.
2387320	2390320	The arch's keystone has a large pearl-colored eye
2390320	2391320	whose lid is shut tightly.
2391320	2394320	It appears to be made of a living material.
2394320	2396320	There's like an eyelid in the door
2396320	2397320	that's made of living material?
2397320	2398320	Yeah, it's at the top of the door,
2398320	2399320	like above the door floor.
2399320	2401320	Oh, above and the arch.
2401320	2403320	It's made of a living material.
2403320	2407320	Spencer, do I have any talents or skills that might...
2407320	2408320	You can look around.
2408320	2410320	You can maybe inspect the door.
2410320	2412320	You can look on the floor.
2412320	2413320	That's a skill.
2413320	2415320	Looking around is a skill, I promise.
2415320	2418320	Spencer, I'm going to invoke my God-given right
2418320	2421320	to look around.
2421320	2423320	You see a small square divot on the ground.
2423320	2426320	It looks to be about 10 inches square.
2426320	2427320	It has dust on it,
2427320	2429320	but the dust has been recently disturbed.
2429320	2430320	Hmm.
2430320	2432320	I think there's a thing that goes in the divot,
2432320	2434320	and that's like an Indiana Jones thing,
2434320	2436320	that, you know...
2436320	2438320	If you have any stuff in your inventory,
2438320	2439320	you can use it.
2439320	2442320	Oh, nice, nice hint.
2442320	2443320	All right.
2443320	2445320	If you have any stuff in your inventory,
2445320	2447320	you're going to use it.
2447320	2449320	I got seven throwing knives?
2449320	2452320	Holy fuck.
2452320	2454320	A compass, a ball of twine,
2454320	2455320	it was a bedroll.
2455320	2456320	I can't stick my backpack in it.
2456320	2458320	That's just stupid.
2458320	2459320	What is this?
2459320	2462320	Small 10-inch square...
2462320	2463320	Use that, use that.
2463320	2464320	What does it say?
2464320	2465320	Square what?
2465320	2466320	Mirror.
2466320	2467320	Mirror?
2467320	2468320	Stick it in there!
2468320	2469320	It's going to shine a light.
2469320	2471320	Why do I have a small 10-inch square mirror
2471320	2472320	just for the hell of it?
2472320	2473320	It's used for scrying sometimes.
2473320	2474320	Oh, okay, all right.
2474320	2475320	So a scrying...
2475320	2478320	Look, I'm no wizard, and I'm no human.
2478320	2479320	I'm saying stick it in there.
2479320	2481320	I think the sun's going to beam in there,
2481320	2482320	and then...
2482320	2484320	Here's what goblins couldn't figure out.
2484320	2487320	I put my small 10-inch square mirror into the divot,
2487320	2491320	so that the sun reflects into the eyeball.
2491320	2493320	As you have said it, it happens.
2493320	2497320	The light streams into the eye.
2497320	2499320	Don't read ahead, Dan.
2500320	2502320	The eye winks open, and you see that it's made out
2502320	2504320	of a giant crystalline substance.
2504320	2505320	It starts to glow.
2505320	2507320	The door disappears.
2507320	2508320	Ooh.
2508320	2509320	Nice.
2509320	2512320	You know what?
2512320	2514320	I got to say, Sharpie.
2514320	2517320	Sharpie, let's just take this moment.
2517320	2520320	It's like we can't lose.
2520320	2523320	You can see there seems to be swinging pendulums
2523320	2524320	down the hall.
2524320	2526320	The hall looks to be covered in gold.
2526320	2528320	I got a bad feeling about that.
2528320	2529320	Well, I don't like these pendulums.
2529320	2530320	Swinging pendulums.
2530320	2531320	Yeah.
2531320	2532320	Sounds like booby traps.
2532320	2533320	Yeah.
2533320	2534320	Very good.
2534320	2536320	Can I use my low-light vision that I have here?
2536320	2537320	Yeah.
2537320	2540320	You can make out charred skeletons on the ground.
2540320	2541320	Charred skeletons.
2541320	2542320	Charred.
2542320	2543320	Okay, this seems like a fucking...
2543320	2546320	Seems like a pendulum-driven torch trap.
2546320	2548320	I'm making it up.
2549320	2551320	All right, so how do we proceed here?
2551320	2552320	Well, you're tiny.
2552320	2554320	Maybe if you just run ahead.
2554320	2561320	It's a bad pitch, but...
2561320	2567320	I would like to cast Detect Magic.
2567320	2570320	All right, you detect magic.
2570320	2573320	Yeah, we would all like to cast Detect Magic.
2573320	2575320	It's a spell that I know, asshole.
2575320	2576320	All right, let's fucking do it.
2576320	2579320	You detect strong magical ores coming from the eye
2579320	2582320	that seems to be glowing and coming from inside the dungeon.
2582320	2584320	All right, well, okay.
2584320	2586320	No big surprise there.
2586320	2588320	Burnt that up.
2588320	2592320	All right, look, we got pendulums and we got charred skeletons.
2592320	2594320	I've got small size, man.
2594320	2596320	Maybe I can weedle my way through there.
2596320	2597320	Just crawl in there.
2597320	2599320	All right, I'm gonna try to crawl through there.
2599320	2600320	You enter the room.
2600320	2602320	It's actually a large hallway.
2602320	2604320	It goes down about 60 feet,
2604320	2608320	and it's interspersed by golden pendulums that swing back and forth.
2608320	2609320	Are they sharp and scary?
2610320	2611320	They aren't sharp and scary,
2611320	2613320	but their pendulums hold crystal lenses
2613320	2615320	that seem to be focusing a white beam
2615320	2618320	that's shooting from the eye in the doorframe down the hallway.
2618320	2620320	As...
2620320	2622320	Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
2622320	2624320	Tomb Raider.
2624320	2627320	No, what are you thinking for?
2627320	2629320	I'm not thinking anything.
2629320	2630320	As the pendulums swing,
2630320	2632320	you notice that they break the white beam of light
2632320	2634320	and reflect it across the room.
2634320	2636320	It seems dangerous, but down the hall,
2636320	2639320	the white light is attempting to melt through a door.
2639320	2641320	Let's stop those pendulums.
2641320	2642320	How do we do it?
2642320	2644320	I don't know. I'm so drunk.
2647320	2650320	I gotta have you with me on this mission.
2650320	2654320	I really... I thought this would be easier.
2654320	2656320	I got so much paperwork here.
2658320	2662320	I'm really starting to regret my choice to be an adventurer.
2663320	2665320	My dad wanted me to...
2665320	2667320	make chairs.
2668320	2671320	I'm making that up about my character.
2672320	2674320	I should have made chairs?
2674320	2676320	How do we attempt to...
2676320	2678320	Can we just go up and physically stop these pendulums from moving?
2678320	2681320	You can definitely try, yeah. Let's try that shit.
2681320	2683320	I want to go up and stop one of these pendulums.
2683320	2685320	All right, you walk up to a pendulum and attempt to stop it.
2685320	2686320	Let's roll.
2686320	2688320	All right.
2689320	2692320	You grab onto it, but you can't stop it.
2692320	2694320	It starts to swing. Do you let go?
2694320	2696320	You think your fingers might get smashed if you don't let go.
2696320	2697320	I'll let go.
2697320	2698320	All right.
2699320	2700320	You let go.
2700320	2702320	The pendulum is still swinging freely.
2702320	2703320	You haven't seemed to stop it.
2703320	2705320	Maybe something in the room can stop it.
2705320	2706320	Let's look around.
2706320	2707320	Yeah.
2707320	2708320	Well, look around.
2708320	2709320	Look around.
2709320	2710320	Look around.
2710320	2711320	God damn it.
2712320	2714320	All right. Well, you don't see anything, I'm afraid,
2714320	2717320	but Sharpie spies that a square on the floor
2717320	2720320	looks a different color of gold than the rest of the floor.
2721320	2724320	All right. Well, then I said they put the mirror in the square.
2724320	2726320	It's not a divot. You can put the mirror on the square.
2726320	2728320	Yeah. I put the mirror on the square.
2728320	2729320	All right. You put the mirror on the square.
2729320	2731320	It is sitting on the floor.
2735320	2737320	Dumbass!
2737320	2741320	I look up on the ceiling from where the square on the floor is.
2741320	2743320	You notice a button on the ceiling.
2743320	2744320	Okay. All right.
2744320	2747320	How high is it? Can I reach it?
2747320	2749320	You might be able to boost cork on your shoulders
2749320	2750320	and he can reach it.
2750320	2751320	All right.
2751320	2753320	Don't you fucking think about it.
2754320	2757320	Remember what happened on the Calderon mind?
2758320	2761320	Just please, can you once stop riddling and...
2761320	2763320	I still have a scar on my head.
2763320	2765320	Get on my shoulders and press the button.
2765320	2766320	You son of a bitch.
2766320	2768320	We'll edit out the parts where we couldn't figure this out
2768320	2769320	for a long time.
2769320	2770320	All right.
2770320	2772320	And we're going to seem like gods.
2772320	2774320	Wait. Sharpie.
2774320	2776320	Let me get in your shoulders.
2781320	2784320	Quirk gets on Sharpie's shoulders if it's possible.
2784320	2785320	It is possible.
2785320	2786320	The button is pushed.
2786320	2788320	The first pendulum grinds to a halt.
2794320	2795320	Are there any more buttons?
2795320	2797320	Well, there's probably two more, right?
2797320	2798320	Do you look on the ceiling?
2798320	2800320	I did.
2800320	2801320	I look on the ceiling.
2801320	2803320	You see two more buttons down the hallway.
2803320	2805320	Push that shit, motherfucker!
2806320	2807320	All right.
2807320	2809320	You successfully pushed the buttons.
2809320	2810320	The pendulums grind to the halt.
2810320	2811320	I know, so easy.
2811320	2813320	I was going to waste a ball of twine on that.
2816320	2817320	Sharpie.
2817320	2818320	You would have caused a huge mess.
2818320	2821320	What did one elevator say to the other elevator?
2821320	2823320	Need a lift?
2825320	2826320	No.
2826320	2827320	No!
2828320	2830320	I think I'm coming down with something.
2831320	2832320	This guy loves riddles.
2832320	2834320	In the middle of a campaign, he loves riddles.
2834320	2835320	I love riddles.
2835320	2836320	All right.
2836320	2840320	So we press all the buttons, and the pendulums all stop.
2840320	2842320	The beam is focused through the pendulums,
2842320	2843320	and it melts the door.
2843320	2844320	The door dissipates.
2844320	2845320	All right.
2845320	2846320	So far, so good.
2846320	2847320	Another stopping point.
2847320	2849320	We should probably camp here for the night.
2849320	2850320	Yeah.
2850320	2851320	Spence for everybody.
2851320	2852320	Spence.
2858320	2859320	It's our fault.
2862320	2865320	Look, I mean, if it's going to take us 20 minutes
2865320	2866320	to get through a bloody door...
2866320	2867320	Well, that's the thing.
2867320	2868320	It's Dungeons and Dragons.
2868320	2872320	It's not, you know, it's not die-hard, you know?
2872320	2874320	You're never 90 minutes from John McClain saving the day.
2874320	2876320	That's the appeal of Dungeons and Dragons.
2876320	2877320	I like it.
2877320	2879320	I like that you and I and the audience here,
2879320	2880320	who I can...
2880320	2884320	I really can sense they were wrapped.
2884320	2885320	Did you notice?
2885320	2886320	I don't want to play into a stereotype,
2886320	2889320	but did you notice that the couple of exasperated sighs
2890320	2891320	and kind of get on with it?
2891320	2892320	They were female voices.
2892320	2893320	Like, it was like...
2893320	2897320	Something about women, they can sense a waste of time
2897320	2898320	before a man can.
2898320	2901320	They're more...
2901320	2904320	It's a sexist cliché, but they're more intuitive.
2904320	2906320	They just know when something's not worth...
2906320	2907320	But as we get better,
2907320	2909320	we're going to start looking around more, right?
2909320	2910320	No, yeah.
2910320	2914320	First of all, we can set up like a looking around macro,
2914320	2916320	you know, and just hit that button.
2916320	2917320	We look around, we look around.
2917320	2918320	Control F means fucking look around.
2919320	2922320	Well, yeah.
2922320	2924320	You liked it when you cleaved that guy in twain.
2924320	2925320	It felt good.
2925320	2927320	It felt real good.
2927320	2928320	All right.
2928320	2929320	What else do we talk about?
2929320	2931320	I'm trying to pour a drink.
2931320	2933320	Like, comp troll for a change.
2933320	2934320	Can we talk about...
2934320	2935320	Let's see what we got here.
2935320	2937320	I want to talk for a moment about...
2937320	2939320	Dan Harmon is a writer.
2939320	2940320	Thank you.
2940320	2941320	He's a writer.
2941320	2945320	And yet, most of my writer friends are completely incapable
2945320	2947320	of telling an actual joke.
2947320	2948320	Oh, right, right, right.
2948320	2949320	Yeah.
2949320	2950320	Dan can't tell a joke.
2950320	2951320	You would think that that's an easy thing.
2951320	2955320	It's like a joke is simply a quick three-act play.
2955320	2957320	A guy goes into a bar, the guy says this,
2957320	2960320	and the punch line, it's a boom, boom, boom, three-act play.
2960320	2961320	I'm a terrible joke teller.
2961320	2962320	You're the worst at it.
2962320	2965320	And we try to coach you on telling a joke.
2965320	2967320	To the point where I swear to God,
2967320	2969320	I've tried to tell the same joke a thousand times,
2969320	2971320	and I still can't tell it.
2971320	2972320	Because you get caught up in the...
2972320	2974320	Is it stage fright, or is it the idea that...
2974320	2975320	I don't know what it is.
2975320	2976320	I don't know what it is.
2976320	2977320	I don't know what it is.
2977320	2979320	Try to tell the Welder's Mask joke.
2979320	2980320	Because there's a joke...
2980320	2981320	Okay, okay, okay.
2981320	2982320	Do you remember the joke?
2982320	2983320	Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.
2983320	2984320	And don't intentionally...
2984320	2986320	No, no, I'm not gonna fuck it up on purpose.
2986320	2987320	Try to tell the joke right.
2987320	2988320	I swear to God, I'm gonna try to tell...
2988320	2991320	I think this, and I'm not trying to over...
2991320	2993320	Like, to tee this too high.
2993320	2998320	I think the Welder's Mask joke is the finest joke joke ever written.
2998320	2999320	And it's...
2999320	3001320	You have to finesse it.
3001320	3002320	It has to be just right.
3002320	3004320	So here's Dan Harmon trying to tell.
3004320	3005320	Okay, all right.
3005320	3006320	The Welder's Mask joke.
3006320	3009320	So there's this eight-year-old kid.
3009320	3012320	And he's walking on the side of a road.
3012320	3015320	And he finds a Welder's Mask.
3015320	3017320	So he puts it on his head.
3017320	3018320	And he flips it down.
3018320	3019320	And he flips it back up.
3019320	3020320	And he flips it down.
3020320	3022320	And he's like, ah, it's a Welder's Mask.
3022320	3023320	It's fun.
3023320	3025320	Fun to have one on.
3029320	3032320	And he's walking down the road in a pickup truck.
3033320	3036320	Pickup truck rolls up alongside him on the road.
3039320	3044320	And the driver says, hey, kid, do you want a ride from me?
3044320	3048320	And the kid goes, eh, yeah, fine.
3048320	3052320	And he gets in the truck.
3052320	3054320	And he's driving with the guy.
3054320	3058320	And the kid flips the Welder's Mask down.
3058320	3059320	Flips it back up.
3059320	3060320	He's playing with it.
3060320	3063320	And it's fun to have a Welder's Mask as a kid.
3063320	3067320	It's more fun for them than it is for a Welder, for certain.
3067320	3075320	For a Welder, it's just vocational banality.
3075320	3077320	It's something you do to protect your eyes.
3077320	3079320	For a kid, it's exciting.
3079320	3081320	He feels like Darth Vader.
3081320	3083320	So he's just playing with it.
3083320	3087320	And the guy driving the pickup is driving the kid along.
3087320	3089320	And he goes, hey, kid.
3089320	3096320	Hey, have you ever heard of massage?
3101320	3107320	And the kid flips the Welder's Mask up and goes, eh, no, no.
3107320	3109320	He flips it back down.
3109320	3112320	The guy drives a little longer and goes, hey, kid,
3112320	3116320	have you ever heard of fellatio?
3116320	3119320	Kid flips the Welder's Mask back up.
3119320	3120320	No, no, no.
3120320	3122320	Flips it back down.
3122320	3124320	Driving for a little while longer.
3124320	3125320	Long pause.
3125320	3133320	Twice as long as the last two, because here it comes.
3133320	3138320	The guy says, hey, kid, do you know what a pedophile is?
3138320	3141320	And the kid flips up his mask in exasperation and goes,
3141320	3149320	look, I've got to tell you, I'm not a real welder.
3149320	3150320	Jeff's giving it to him.
3150320	3152320	See, I can't tell that joke right, apparently.
3152320	3154320	Yeah, if you tell that joke right,
3154320	3157320	these people erupt into applause.
3157320	3159320	First of all, the kid puts the Welder's Mask on.
3159320	3160320	He gets in the car.
3160320	3162320	And the guy says, do you know what fellatio is?
3162320	3163320	The kid says no.
3163320	3165320	Do you know what sodomy is?
3165320	3166320	The kid says no.
3166320	3167320	Do you know what a pedophile is?
3167320	3170320	And the kid says, look, mister, I've got to be honest with you.
3170320	3172320	I'm not really a welder.
3172320	3173320	Funnier?
3173320	3174320	I don't know.
3174320	3175320	Yeah, yeah.
3175320	3176320	Market size.
3176320	3177320	I can't tell jokes.
3177320	3178320	You're right.
3178320	3179320	Do you have another joke?
3179320	3180320	Yeah, yeah.
3180320	3182320	The other one I've never been able to tell correctly
3182320	3185320	is the duck one.
3185320	3187320	Why am I identifying it with you?
3187320	3188320	Sorry to tell it.
3188320	3189320	Okay.
3189320	3191320	And I'm covering my eyes.
3191320	3194320	Before you tell this, what do you think your problem is
3194320	3195320	with telling jokes?
3195320	3197320	It's because I'm trying to put myself in the place.
3197320	3199320	I'm trying to describe to the audience
3199320	3203320	a situation that's happening, and it's important to be there.
3203320	3205320	I don't know.
3205320	3208320	I think it's because jokes are purely semantic.
3208320	3213320	There's a semantic cadence that has so...
3213320	3215320	It's punnery.
3215320	3219320	It's a deception because it really has nothing to do
3219320	3222320	with the actual scene that's happening,
3222320	3223320	and yet it seems like it is.
3223320	3225320	It seems like a guy's walking into a bar.
3225320	3226320	You need to picture the guy walking into the bar.
3226320	3228320	I always picture the guy walking into the bar.
3228320	3230320	I'm trying to make my bad joke telling sound
3230320	3232320	like it's part of a huge gift.
3232320	3234320	I'm just bad at telling jokes.
3234320	3237320	I'm just trying to describe what happens in my brain.
3237320	3240320	I try to tell the joke, and I remember the joke
3240320	3243320	because I remember what happened to who,
3243320	3244320	and then I start...
3244320	3246320	So then I go there, and then I don't say
3246320	3248320	the right combination of words right.
3248320	3251320	Because the kid's supposed to say the certain combination of words
3251320	3254320	just to land that joke in this Jeffrey Ross fucking tough crowd
3254320	3256320	with Colin Quinway.
3257320	3260320	Those guys know how to do it, and I'm stuck in the moment.
3260320	3262320	The kid's in the truck, and he could get raped
3262320	3264320	if he's not careful.
3264320	3265320	I think when you're telling a joke
3265320	3268320	that you feel the silence that you're hearing
3268320	3270320	when people are listening to the joke
3270320	3273320	as some sort of indictment that you...
3273320	3274320	No, no, no, no. It's not that.
3274320	3276320	I swear to God it's not that.
3276320	3279320	The duck one, just fire off from the fucking hip.
3279320	3283320	A guy walks into a whorehouse, and he says,
3283320	3285320	what do you got for me?
3285320	3288320	I want to have a whore encounter.
3291320	3293320	I'm not looking at you guys.
3293320	3295320	Just stop engaging me.
3295320	3296320	I'm just going to barrel through this.
3296320	3299320	It's at the whore master, whatever you call him.
3301320	3304320	All right, so it's already falling apart.
3304320	3307320	Whatever you call him, the madam, the madam,
3307320	3311320	the clerk, the whore clerk, says,
3311320	3316320	look, we're all out of whores right now.
3316320	3318320	Like, they're all busy.
3318320	3319320	They're fresh out of whores.
3319320	3320320	Tell me where we are. They're busy.
3320320	3323320	They're busy whoring, I gotta tell you.
3323320	3325320	No, no, no, no. I'm sorry.
3325320	3327320	She goes...
3327320	3330320	He goes, like, we're out of...
3330320	3332320	Look, the whores are busy,
3332320	3334320	and also, like, the ones that we have,
3334320	3338320	they're too expensive for you,
3338320	3340320	just judging from your clothing.
3340320	3343320	And the guy goes, all I have is a...
3343320	3345320	Forget all that that happened.
3345320	3349320	Just understand that a guy walked into a whore house,
3349320	3352320	and then the whore person said, like, what do you want?
3352320	3355320	And then this guy said, I have a dollar, okay?
3355320	3356320	That's what he had.
3356320	3359320	And this is a time when a dollar...
3361320	3362320	He had a...
3362320	3364320	This is a different time.
3364320	3365320	Can I have a cigarette?
3365320	3368320	This is a different time in America, you know?
3368320	3371320	Like, there was a reasonable expectation for a dollar at a whore house.
3371320	3374320	So he goes, I have a dollar. I have a dollar.
3374320	3379320	And the whore master says, well, you know,
3379320	3381320	we don't have any whores for a dollar here.
3381320	3383320	Times are changing. There's telegraphs going up.
3383320	3385320	You know, this is...
3385320	3388320	I don't know what you came in here expecting, but...
3388320	3390320	This would be like the mid-1800s.
3390320	3394320	I'll tell you, you certainly can't have a human whore for a dollar.
3394320	3396320	What you can have is this duck,
3396320	3400320	and he pulls a duck out, like, from underneath the counter,
3400320	3404320	the whore counter, and says, you can have a duck for a dollar.
3404320	3405320	You can have this duck.
3405320	3407320	And the guy's like, I came all the way into town.
3407320	3409320	I'm certainly not going to go back.
3409320	3411320	I got all psyched up for...
3411320	3414320	I've been talking to this guy for 45 minutes.
3414320	3417320	So he gives the guy the dollar.
3417320	3418320	He takes the duck upstairs.
3418320	3420320	He goes upstairs.
3420320	3425320	He actually has a great time with the duck.
3425320	3429320	You know, they have vaginas.
3429320	3433320	I don't know why he has a great time. It doesn't matter.
3433320	3435320	What? Aaron, why is everyone...
3435320	3439320	Dan, Dan, you're doing great, honey.
3444320	3447320	I'm not doing it on purpose. I'm telling you the joke is fast.
3447320	3448320	The beauty is...
3448320	3450320	He has a good time with the...
3450320	3452320	I'm going to speed through the rest of it, okay?
3452320	3455320	It's amazing. You're not fucking around right now.
3455320	3456320	He has a good time with the duck.
3456320	3457320	This is how he tells jokes for real.
3457320	3458320	He has a great time with the duck.
3458320	3460320	He comes down and he gives the duck back.
3460320	3463320	The joke is halfway over.
3463320	3465320	I had a great time with this duck.
3465320	3467320	Thank you. And he just leaves. It doesn't matter.
3467320	3473320	So he comes back the next day and he says,
3473320	3480320	Listen, I brought another dollar.
3480320	3487320	Can I have the duck again?
3487320	3494320	And the whore tender puts the duck on the counter
3494320	3497320	and says, here's the duck.
3497320	3502320	Does the whore tender work beneath or above the whore master?
3502320	3505320	It goes whore master, whore tender.
3505320	3507320	He was doing whore back.
3507320	3510320	You can't order from the whore tender.
3510320	3512320	He was whore backing.
3512320	3513320	He was in the weeds.
3513320	3516320	He's cleaning ducks out.
3516320	3518320	He puts a duck on the counter.
3518320	3520320	I already fucked it up. I know this.
3520320	3523320	Dan, you're perfect.
3523320	3525320	It's like the black stallion.
3525320	3527320	Aaron calling out, you're perfect.
3527320	3529320	I'm going to tell the joke right.
3529320	3531320	He puts the duck on the counter.
3531320	3533320	God damn it. I fucked it up.
3533320	3536320	You don't say.
3536320	3540320	Can you just rewind one day in the story?
3540320	3543320	What already happened is the first transaction
3543320	3545320	where the guy got the duck and he had the time of his life.
3545320	3547320	I'm sorry about this.
3547320	3551320	So the guy comes back in and he comes in and he goes,
3551320	3553320	I'll take the duck.
3553320	3555320	And the guy puts the duck on the counter and he takes the duck
3555320	3558320	and he goes upstairs, again has the time of his life,
3558320	3560320	comes back down, puts the duck on the counter,
3560320	3564320	and the whore master says, that'll be five dollars.
3564320	3567320	And the guy says, yesterday it was a dollar,
3567320	3571320	and the whore master says, that duck had AIDS.
3575320	3584320	It doesn't seem like a funny joke to me either, but
3584320	3587320	when I heard it told, everyone laughed.
3587320	3589320	And I've been trying to tell it.
3589320	3594320	You know why? Because their joke came in under ten fucking minutes.
3594320	3597320	Let me try one more. I swear to God I can tell this one right.
3597320	3599320	Just one more, one more, one more, one more.
3599320	3601320	I swear to God that's why I will not.
3601320	3603320	By the way, we serve breakfast everybody.
3603320	3606320	It's like three minutes. I'll be through this one.
3606320	3608320	Like not even, not even. I swear to God.
3608320	3611320	Okay. 75 year old man's walking down a sidewalk.
3611320	3614320	He walks past a frog. The frog looks up at him and says,
3614320	3617320	Hey, I'm a magical frog. If you kiss me,
3617320	3619320	I'll turn into a beautiful princess,
3619320	3622320	and I'll have sex with you for the rest of your life.
3622320	3624320	And mine, probably.
3624320	3626320	Stay on target.
3626320	3629320	Stay on target.
3629320	3632320	And the old man says, what did you say?
3632320	3634320	Because of the rule of threes.
3634320	3636320	You fucked it. You fucked it. You had it.
3636320	3639320	No, no, no. They're savvy. They know.
3639320	3641320	He just has to repeat it.
3641320	3643320	He says, what did you say?
3643320	3645320	I said, I'm a magical frog. If you pick me up and kiss me,
3645320	3647320	I'll turn into a beautiful princess,
3647320	3649320	and I'll have sex with you for the rest of your life.
3649320	3652320	The old man picks up the frog, puts it in his pocket,
3652320	3654320	starts walking down the sidewalk,
3654320	3657320	walks for a block. The frog calls out from his pocket.
3657320	3659320	Hey, what are you doing? I said, I'm a magic frog,
3659320	3661320	and if you pick me up and kiss me,
3661320	3662320	I'll turn into a beautiful princess
3662320	3664320	and have sex with you for the rest of your life.
3664320	3665320	The old man looks down in his pocket and says,
3665320	3669320	I'm 75 years old. I think it's cooler to have a talking frog.
3669320	3683320	The joke master.
3683320	3687320	Next stop, Burn Notice. What's that Jeffrey Ross show?
3687320	3689320	The Burn Man. The Burn. The Burn.
3689320	3690320	The Burn.
3690320	3693320	Man, that guy's looking weird.
3693320	3695320	Is it? Is it? Is it?
3695320	3697320	Does he know? Does he know?
3697320	3699320	Are you about to roast Jeffrey Ross right now?
3699320	3703320	Can you? Can you roast a roaster?
3703320	3705320	He's starting to look weird, isn't he?
3705320	3707320	He's starting to look like the Vasquez Rock.
3707320	3711320	He's becoming like a labyrinth character, for sure.
3711320	3713320	Speaking of labyrinths.
3713320	3715320	We're back.
3715320	3718320	We can't, right? No, no. The women will revolt.
3718320	3720320	You can hear them pop. They're like, no,
3720320	3722320	fuck you with your mirrors in your hallways.
3722320	3724320	Don't go back into that dungeon.
3724320	3726320	Well, I feel like we have a huge room here,
3726320	3728320	and I'm putting myself in their shoes,
3728320	3732320	watching the two of us drink and flounder around in a hallway.
3732320	3735320	There's probably people that go, oh, fucking, look it up.
3735320	3737320	There's buttons all over this place.
3737320	3740320	So you want to bring somebody up who's a little more,
3740320	3742320	maybe they could help us be like a spirit guide?
3742320	3744320	I don't know. Do we have anybody?
3744320	3746320	Oh, shit, we got it.
3746320	3747320	Oh, God.
3747320	3749320	Oh, no. Adam.
3749320	3750320	All right, that's shit. Get up here.
3750320	3752320	Who else raised their hand over there?
3752320	3753320	Okay, the two of you over there.
3753320	3755320	All right, let's bring these three up,
3755320	3757320	for better or for worse.
3757320	3760320	What are we doing?
3760320	3764320	Stand over in the corner like a Greek chorus.
3764320	3770320	Jeff just uncorked this bottle.
3770320	3772320	For those of you listening in podcast world,
3772320	3778320	the world's best boy band just walked on stage right now.
3778320	3780320	We have Adam on the left in the middle.
3780320	3781320	What's your name, sir?
3781320	3782320	Me?
3782320	3783320	Yeah, in the middle.
3783320	3784320	Doug?
3784320	3785320	Yep.
3785320	3786320	And?
3786320	3787320	Colin.
3787320	3789320	Adam, Doug, and Colin, everybody.
3789320	3792320	Yeah, collectively known as?
3792320	3794320	Adam, Doug, Colin.
3794320	3797320	Dreamweaver.
3797320	3802320	Spencer, where were we?
3802320	3804320	When we last left our heroes.
3804320	3806320	They had just broken down the door.
3806320	3807320	Sorry, Spencer.
3807320	3809320	Dan just paused a moment to Instagram.
3809320	3810320	What's going on right now?
3810320	3812320	Let's take a picture of Dreamweaver.
3812320	3813320	Dreamweaver.
3813320	3814320	All right, Spencer, I'm sorry.
3814320	3815320	All right.
3815320	3816320	So you want me to...
3816320	3817320	We keep going?
3817320	3818320	Yeah, yeah.
3818320	3819320	We're trucking through that doorway, right?
3819320	3820320	Yeah, you just melted the door.
3820320	3821320	Do you want to look in it?
3821320	3822320	Hell, yeah.
3822320	3826320	All right, you look through the door.
3826320	3829320	It's a large room that extends to the north and to the south.
3829320	3832320	In front of you, the white beam continues on.
3832320	3834320	It hits a large crystal red eye,
3834320	3837320	but the eye doesn't seem to be reacting to the white beam.
3837320	3840320	In the room are three large pillars,
3840320	3843320	each containing glass objects.
3843320	3845320	In the center is a large prism,
3845320	3849320	and flanked on its sides are two large crystal globes.
3849320	3855320	All right, well, this is obviously like a fruity puzzle.
3855320	3857320	I love riddles.
3857320	3858320	Yeah.
3858320	3860320	So we're going to want that prism, right?
3860320	3861320	Well, it's based...
3861320	3862320	Yeah, it's...
3862320	3863320	You know what, Dan?
3863320	3864320	Rotate the prism.
3864320	3865320	You and I consider all day,
3865320	3868320	and consult Dream Waiver.
3868320	3869320	Dream Waiver, you got any ideas?
3869320	3870320	Doug.
3870320	3873320	First idea is light refraction throughout the room.
3873320	3874320	The crystal eye is the color red.
3874320	3875320	The beam is white.
3875320	3878320	You probably have to turn the beam red through the crystals
3878320	3887320	to hit the eye to get to the next room.
3887320	3888320	Doug.
3888320	3892320	Didoy.
3892320	3894320	One step ahead of you, Doug.
3895320	3896320	All right.
3896320	3897320	Does this prism rotate?
3897320	3899320	Is it movable?
3899320	3900320	You approach the pillar.
3900320	3903320	It looks like it could be slid.
3903320	3906320	Hey, I got a sword.
3906320	3907320	Well, don't...
3907320	3908320	Take it easy with a sword.
3908320	3909320	I want a slit.
3909320	3910320	I want to slit that shit.
3910320	3911320	No, not slit.
3911320	3912320	Slid.
3912320	3913320	Slid.
3913320	3914320	Oh, shit.
3914320	3915320	Sorry.
3915320	3916320	Chop it with a sword.
3916320	3917320	I'm going to chop...
3917320	3919320	I'll chop you with a sword, you fucking piece of shit.
3919320	3922320	So if you move the prism,
3922320	3924320	can you move it into the...
3924320	3926320	I could murder a cigarette right now.
3926320	3929320	You move it into the white beam and it turns...
3929320	3931320	Do you want to try to do that?
3931320	3932320	Yes.
3932320	3933320	All right.
3933320	3936320	You move the pillar containing the prism.
3936320	3939320	It slides into place as the white beam hits it.
3939320	3943320	The white beam splits into three beams, red, green, and blue.
3943320	3946320	The red beam continues on and hits the crystal eye.
3946320	3948320	It glows and you hear a far-off rumble.
3948320	3949320	Nice.
3949320	3950320	Way to go, Doug.
3951320	3953320	Dreamweaver.
3954320	3957320	I believe they can get us through the door.
3962320	3963320	Fucking Dreamweaver.
3963320	3965320	You guys are coming back next week.
3967320	3969320	So we opened another door.
3969320	3970320	There's no door in this room.
3970320	3971320	God damn it.
3971320	3974320	The green and blue beams go north and south.
3974320	3976320	They look like they're hitting the far walls,
3976320	3979320	but they're kind of near those pillars I mentioned earlier.
3979320	3980320	Okay.
3980320	3983320	So we move the pillars into the paths of their corresponding beams, right?
3983320	3984320	All right.
3984320	3985320	Well, do you try to do that?
3985320	3986320	Yes.
3986320	3987320	Well, how do you do that?
3987320	3988320	Do you do it like one at a time?
3988320	3989320	What's up?
3989320	3990320	Together.
3990320	3991320	We work in tandem.
3991320	3992320	You take the green one.
3992320	3993320	I'll take the blue one.
3993320	3995320	And I'll be in Scotland before you.
3996320	3997320	All right.
3997320	3999320	You synchronize your watches.
3999320	4000320	You push.
4000320	4001320	We have watches?
4001320	4002320	No.
4002320	4003320	That's lying.
4003320	4004320	All right.
4004320	4006320	You push the pillars into the beams.
4006320	4008320	You hear a loud humming sound,
4008320	4011320	and you feel a tingling sensation across your body,
4011320	4012320	a pulling on your skin,
4012320	4014320	and then a tug behind your navel,
4014320	4016320	and you feel yourself being teleported.
4016320	4017320	Ooh.
4018320	4020320	We're being teleported.
4020320	4021320	I like it.
4023320	4024320	We choose to like it.
4025320	4027320	You enjoy the teleportation.
4029320	4030320	All right.
4033320	4034320	They applaud.
4034320	4035320	The audience applauds it.
4035320	4036320	We're on a journey, man.
4036320	4037320	People love teleporting.
4037320	4039320	You guys, we're all in this together.
4040320	4041320	All right.
4041320	4042320	So you appear.
4042320	4043320	I'll explain this to you guys.
4043320	4044320	All right.
4045320	4048320	There's a large open room before you.
4048320	4050320	You think it must be a few hundred feet,
4050320	4052320	and it seems to be rectangular.
4052320	4053320	You can see across.
4053320	4056320	There's a large pit splitting the room in two.
4056320	4058320	It looks to be bottomless.
4058320	4060320	You can see on the other side of the pit,
4060320	4062320	your friend, Sharpie,
4062320	4064320	your friend, Cork,
4064320	4066320	across the pit on the other side.
4066320	4068320	We're separated by this fissure
4068320	4069320	in the middle of the room?
4069320	4070320	Yes.
4070320	4071320	This fissure is very wide.
4071320	4072320	You don't think you could jump it.
4072320	4074320	It's wider than the ledges you're standing on.
4074320	4075320	So we've been separated.
4075320	4076320	You've been separated.
4078320	4079320	I miss you.
4081320	4083320	You reach out across the void,
4083320	4085320	and somehow you know he can tell
4085320	4087320	that you're there for him.
4087320	4089320	So do we need to get back together?
4089320	4090320	I don't know.
4090320	4091320	Do you look around?
4093320	4094320	Look.
4094320	4096320	I'm always looking around, Spencer.
4096320	4097320	All right.
4097320	4098320	I look around.
4098320	4100320	Across the chasm, you can see that red eye.
4100320	4101320	Wait, chasm?
4101320	4102320	Chasm.
4102320	4103320	Fissure, bottomless pit.
4103320	4104320	Chasm.
4104320	4105320	Chasm.
4105320	4106320	I say words.
4106320	4107320	All right.
4107320	4108320	Okay.
4108320	4109320	Don't try to separate the desert, master.
4109320	4110320	I'm sorry.
4110320	4111320	I look across chasm.
4111320	4112320	Sabotage.
4112320	4113320	Whatever.
4113320	4115320	I look across the chasm, and I see what?
4115320	4117320	You see the beam arcing across the room.
4117320	4119320	It seems to be going down the path,
4119320	4122320	but your path is blocked by a large crystal slab.
4122320	4125320	You notice that the orbs that you are near
4125320	4129320	are glowing and emitting blue and green light in a ray.
4129320	4131320	It's hitting a statue.
4131320	4135320	I turned my statue to reflect or catch, receive beam.
4135320	4137320	As you have said it, it happens.
4137320	4139320	You melt the blue crystal to nothing.
4139320	4140320	Sweet.
4140320	4141320	Wait, that's bad.
4141320	4142320	No?
4142320	4144320	You can see past the crystal.
4144320	4146320	Behind it is another crystal slab.
4146320	4148320	It's the same color and another statue.
4148320	4150320	Do we have to keep turning the statues?
4150320	4151320	Maybe.
4151320	4153320	I'm going to turn one more statue.
4153320	4154320	All right.
4154320	4155320	You turn the statue.
4155320	4157320	It reflects the beam into the slab,
4157320	4160320	but behind the slab, after it disappears,
4160320	4163320	is a statue of the color across the room.
4163320	4167320	It's just, it's hard to, I'm so drunk, you know?
4167320	4169320	Turn a statue.
4169320	4171320	I turn the statue again.
4171320	4172320	All right.
4172320	4174320	You turn the statue in much the same way,
4174320	4176320	and your path is now blocked by a crystal
4176320	4179320	of the color of your partner across the room.
4179320	4180320	Shit.
4180320	4181320	Adam?
4181320	4185320	Just keep turning statues.
4185320	4189320	It's the first time Adam and I have been on the same page.
4189320	4193320	So now we, let's set up camp and just get to know each other.
4193320	4195320	Can we set up camp and just have a little powwow?
4195320	4196320	Yeah, you can have a powwow.
4196320	4197320	I mean, we're not together.
4197320	4199320	Yeah, well, I mean, you wouldn't be talking to each other.
4199320	4200320	There's a Fisher across the room.
4200320	4201320	You can send hawk messages.
4201320	4203320	Yeah, we can see each other.
4203320	4204320	Send me a hawk message.
4204320	4205320	Let's just build a little fire.
4205320	4207320	Let's just talk about our backstory.
4207320	4208320	All right.
4208320	4212320	My father hit me.
4212320	4213320	For real?
4213320	4216320	That's why I wanted to learn magic.
4216320	4218320	Where did you study magic?
4218320	4221320	The Arcanium.
4221320	4222320	That's very prestigious.
4222320	4224320	Do you have a scholarship or did you?
4224320	4226320	No, I-
4226320	4227320	Are you born rich?
4227320	4228320	No, God no.
4228320	4230320	You're one of those rich wizards.
4230320	4231320	You didn't fucking earn it.
4231320	4232320	Heavens, no.
4232320	4233320	You didn't earn it.
4233320	4237320	Anybody could go get a scholarship to a wizard school.
4237320	4239320	Watch your characteristic temper, quark.
4239320	4240320	Oh, boy.
4240320	4241320	I'm fucking not-
4241320	4244320	I'll stab a wizard in a second.
4244320	4246320	I am the definition of a bootstrapper.
4246320	4252320	I looked into the arcane arts because I wanted to prove my father wrong about me.
4252320	4257320	My father, actually, in point of fact, was a barbarian like you.
4257320	4258320	Adam, get on mic.
4258320	4261320	If you're going to start being a PT Barnum here guy.
4261320	4262320	Flashback.
4262320	4270320	Flashback to the Arcanarium where Sharpie was teased mercilessly by rich, spoiled wizards.
4270320	4271320	All right.
4271320	4272320	Played by the-
4272320	4273320	Played by Dreamweaver, actually.
4273320	4275320	All right, go for it, guys.
4275320	4279320	It's the magical dining hall.
4279320	4280320	I'm so sorry, Spencer.
4280320	4281320	I'm going to apologize to you after this.
4281320	4282320	I'm so sorry.
4282320	4283320	No, this is great.
4283320	4289320	The spoiled dining hall where he sits at the poor kid's table with a scholarship inariums.
4289320	4291320	You guys mind if I sit here?
4291320	4292320	No.
4292320	4293320	Yeah.
4293320	4294320	What are you?
4294320	4295320	I do mind.
4295320	4296320	Sharpie Bottom.
4296320	4297320	Very helpful.
4297320	4298320	New kid's school.
4298320	4299320	It's butts a lot.
4299320	4300320	Yeah, butts.
4300320	4301320	Oh, all right.
4301320	4305320	Yeah, I see you with your poor man spell.
4305320	4308320	What was that, Tale of Newt?
4308320	4311320	You know, one of these days I'm going to be an adventurer.
4311320	4312320	You guys aren't going to be shit.
4312320	4315320	I'm going to learn spells and I'm going to detect magic.
4315320	4316320	Sure you are.
4316320	4318320	Yeah, you know where all the real adventures go?
4318320	4319320	The howling minds.
4319320	4320320	Sharpie.
4320320	4322320	You don't have any idea where that is?
4322320	4323320	Sharpie.
4323320	4324320	Well, I'm waking up.
4324320	4330320	I'm waking up next to the cat, the fisher and the minds that we're in, right?
4330320	4331320	Oh, sorry.
4331320	4332320	You're having a weird dream.
4332320	4333320	Yeah.
4333320	4334320	Sorry.
4334320	4335320	Hey, hey, Quark over there.
4335320	4337320	Did you pick up on me having a weird dream?
4337320	4338320	Yeah, yeah.
4338320	4340320	You seem like you were talking in your sleep.
4340320	4343320	My childhood was fucked up, man.
4343320	4345320	I got a lot to prove.
4345320	4349320	Sometimes I wish I could launch into a rage like you and just like make everything okay.
4350320	4355320	I wish there was a way to get out of this room.
4355320	4356320	All right.
4356320	4359320	One more description of these beams of light in their configuration.
4359320	4362320	Believe me, this is open to the whole bloody fucking nerd mode right now.
4362320	4364320	Anybody has an idea right now?
4366320	4367320	Say what?
4367320	4368320	Aim the what?
4368320	4370320	Cross the beams.
4370320	4371320	Cross the beams.
4372320	4373320	Wait.
4373320	4375320	I thought you said that would be bad.
4375320	4376320	Cross the beams.
4376320	4378320	Is there a way Spencer to cross these beams?
4378320	4382320	If you shoot the beams across the chasms at the other guy's wall, maybe something.
4382320	4384320	I'm going to chasm beam.
4384320	4385320	I'm going to beam my chasms.
4385320	4388320	We shoot the beams across the chasm at the other guy's wall.
4388320	4389320	You melt the walls.
4389320	4390320	Fuck yeah.
4393320	4396320	And scene.
4396320	4397320	No, no, no, no.
4397320	4398320	Okay.
4398320	4400320	Let's get a little, let's get a little taste here.
4400320	4401320	Okay.
4401320	4404320	Let's find out what the next threshold is and then we'll stop it there.
4404320	4405320	So we'll take a peek through.
4405320	4406320	We've melted the walls.
4406320	4407320	My guess, more light beams.
4407320	4408320	More light beams?
4408320	4409320	Maybe.
4409320	4412320	More square mirrors or possibly round mirrors.
4412320	4415320	Where is the door in relation to the two guys in this guy?
4415320	4418320	Because we're still separated from fire.
4418320	4419320	Yeah.
4419320	4420320	You don't see a door yet.
4420320	4423320	However, as the walls dissipate, you can see.
4423320	4425320	Remember that red beam from earlier?
4425320	4426320	How can I forget?
4426320	4428320	The red beam.
4428320	4429320	Well, he's back.
4429320	4434320	And this time he means business.
4434320	4437320	All right.
4437320	4442320	You can see that the red beam is hitting a crystal that seems to be block it from blocking
4442320	4445320	it from accessing a large crystal spear that's hanging in the air.
4445320	4446320	All right.
4446320	4447320	All right.
4447320	4451320	Well, the red beam is being blocked by a blue crystal, a green crystal, and behind that
4451320	4452320	a red crystal.
4452320	4453320	All right.
4453320	4455320	There's your sneak preview of the red beam.
4455320	4456320	Behind that, a red crystal.
4456320	4457320	All right.
4457320	4460320	There's your sneak preview of what lies in store.
4460320	4464320	So we should stop it right there, you say, right?
4464320	4465320	Probably.
4465320	4466320	Yeah.
4466320	4468320	It feels like the Glendale Galleria at Christmas time.
4468320	4470320	There's your cliffhanger for next week.
4470320	4471320	Yeah.
4471320	4472320	Yeah.
4472320	4475320	Will the blue ray?
4475320	4479320	Will more beams be turned toward other beams?
4479320	4481320	What will reflect the beam?
4481320	4483320	Will more tellas be ported?
4484320	4485320	All right.
4485320	4486320	Well, yeah.
4486320	4487320	Let's hear it for Dreamweaver, everybody.
4487320	4488320	First of all.
4488320	4490320	Dreamweaver, our geek chorus.
4490320	4492320	Our geek chorus?
4492320	4494320	That's our geek chorus.
4494320	4495320	You say geek chorus?
4495320	4497320	Yeah, I have a Greek chorus, our geek chorus.
4497320	4498320	Fantastic.
4498320	4500320	And Spencer, our dungeon master once again.
4500320	4502320	Spencer, our dungeon master.
4502320	4503320	All right.
4503320	4505320	So it's 9.55.
4505320	4508320	We started at 8.20-ish.
4508320	4509320	We should wrap it up.
4509320	4510320	How do we wrap it up?
4510320	4511320	We've gotten lazy.
4511320	4514320	We've usually wrapped it up with a kind of rapid fire around.
4514320	4517320	I've played a hacky, comedy, sportsy,
4517320	4519320	I'll answer questions in three words thing.
4519320	4521320	We don't have that life saver anymore.
4521320	4523320	How do we wrap up tonight?
4523320	4526320	You want to do it in song?
4526320	4527320	I mean, I don't know.
4527320	4529320	It's something...
4529320	4530320	How about...
4530320	4532320	Don't encourage it.
4532320	4534320	How about Dan?
4534320	4535320	I just want you to follow your heart here.
4535320	4537320	I want you to...
4537320	4539320	First of all, before I do this,
4539320	4542320	I want you to think about what happened tonight.
4542320	4545320	Refresh our memory here.
4545320	4546320	There was no theme tonight.
4546320	4547320	We didn't fall back on that.
4547320	4549320	We just talked to people.
4549320	4551320	Yeah, we just let it happen.
4551320	4552320	We just reached out.
4552320	4553320	I hope we touched you.
4553320	4556320	We talked about talking to you.
4556320	4558320	We brought up Spencer.
4558320	4561320	We embarked on a terrifying mission.
4561320	4565320	We came together in our two new Avatar cells.
4565320	4567320	We have a new segment to our show.
4567320	4570320	We found out that you're terrible at telling jokes.
4570320	4572320	And yet when you tell a joke wrong,
4572320	4576320	it becomes more delightful than a joke being told properly.
4576320	4577320	Right.
4577320	4580320	I just say...
4580320	4583320	Whatever you're doing, I'm going to fail at.
4583320	4586320	So then we're going to be stuck here for a little longer.
4586320	4587320	There's no question about that.
4587320	4589320	I just say...
4589320	4592320	I just say maybe just think about what happened tonight.
4592320	4595320	Express how you're feeling now in song.
4595320	4596320	Okay.
4596320	4604320	Well, I had a good show.
4604320	4606320	Or maybe it was bad.
4606320	4611320	It may not be the best show that a Harmon Town fan's ever had.
4611320	4614320	Because if you've been to six of them,
4614320	4620320	you've been to four better ones.
4620320	4624320	Well, that's just tough cosmic titties.
4624320	4628320	For $10 worth of fun.
4628320	4630320	Thank you for coming, everybody.
4630320	4633320	Thank you for coming.
4633320	4635320	You got your $10 worth, I hope.
4635320	4638320	If not, see us after the show, I think.
4638320	4639320	Ladies and gentlemen.
4639320	4640320	Thank you, Spencer.
4640320	4642320	Thank you, Geek Chorus.
4642320	4644320	Thank you, Jeff Davis, for comtrolling.
4644320	4646320	Jeff's got some people to thank.
4646320	4648320	Yeah, let's thank Katie Levine, Audio Recording,
4648320	4650320	Zach McKeever, our tech guy on site,
4650320	4652320	Emily Gordon, our producer,
4652320	4654320	Kramer Program Director,
4654320	4657320	Dustin Marshall, our podcast producer,
4657320	4659320	Mo Fafelbab, the on-site director,
4659320	4661320	and Jenny Finer, a fantastic artist.
4661320	4663320	Once again, I'm Jeff Davis, comtrolling.
4663320	4664320	Thank you, Nerdmelt.
4664320	4666320	Thank you, people listening on site.
4666320	4668320	Thank you all for coming down here.
4668320	4673320	Spencer, Geek Chorus, one more time for your mayor of Harmon Town, Dan Harmon.
4673320	4675320	Thank you.
4675320	4676320	You guys are great.
4676320	4680320	You're very, very wonderful and enthusiastic and patient.
4680320	4683320	The campaign continues next week.
4683320	4686320	Imagine how many pillars will be turned.
4686320	4688320	Thank you.
4688320	4691320	Danadu.
4691320	4694320	Danadu.
