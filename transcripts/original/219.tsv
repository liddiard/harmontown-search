549740	551740	hello, New York
555740	562740	from the fabulous Gramercy Theatre in downtown, uh, Greenwich, uh, upper, upper East Greenwich,
562740	564740	it's, Harmontown is now in session
564740	570740	let's bring to the stage Spencer Crittenden
580740	582740	hey guys
582740	584740	oh shit
584740	588740	and the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon
588740	590740	Dan Harmon
590740	594740	thank you, New York, thank you
594740	596740	oh yeah
596740	598740	uh uh uh
598740	600740	yeah, we did a little experimental thing
600740	602740	I did some typing before the show
602740	604740	is this the place where we did that the first time?
604740	606740	no, that was uh
606740	608740	that was Canada, where everything is an experiment
608740	610740	thank you, lights
610740	612740	uh uh uh
612740	614740	thank you so much, I know it's a
614740	616740	you know, your uh, what do you call it, your uh, circadian schedule
616740	618740	is that what it's called?
618740	620740	your circadian, uh, rhythm
620740	622740	you know
622740	624740	rhythm
624740	628740	the sine wave of your, of your circadian, uh, ups and downs
628740	630740	oh, rhythm
630740	632740	it's, I'll look it up later
632740	634740	uh
634740	640740	it's probably telling you that nothing is interesting or funny, or if you're drunk, that there's something wrong with you
640740	644740	I, you know, I can't combat that
644740	646740	right, we're doing our jobs, you guys gotta step up
646740	650740	right, but I did, cause I thought, okay, so I, wait
652740	656740	I mean, you don't have to wait, you are waiting, you're an audience, that's what you do
656740	658740	I don't have to tell you to wait
658740	662740	sorry, I'm sorry, I, I, I, I, I made, I made like a
662740	666740	on the way here in the cab, I made a powerpoint on the
666740	668740	that's it
668740	670740	wait
670740	672740	wait
672740	675740	okay, I don't believe he said I was here somewhere
676740	678740	Levi, is it
678740	680740	is it
681740	683740	woooo
683740	685740	oh, it's in preview, okay
685740	687740	do you have open MU on that thing?
687740	689740	we should play Mario
689740	691740	oh, there it is, okay
691740	693740	wait, I can, I think you just, okay
693740	695740	okay
695740	697740	alright
697740	701740	Steve Levi, everybody
701740	703740	yes, yes
703740	708740	alright, my presentation, for those of you who are later listening and who didn't pay a million dollars
708740	712740	so who cares about your needs, but for those of you who are listening
712740	717740	the show is, this slideshow is called New York Show, why it will be great
717740	719740	that's the first slide, and then
719740	721740	okay, what, alright
721740	725740	alright, let's not really, okay
725740	727740	I don't know if
727740	733740	I didn't expect it to be this bad
733740	735740	alright
735740	740740	it's supposed to still be able to be a slideshow, but they're just scrolling through like a papyrus on screen
740740	746740	what is a show, a show is entertainment, success, connection, and there's a boat, because it's a
746740	749740	why was that boat all wrinkly?
749740	754740	this is, this is a, there's a quote slide with, Johnny Appleseed said type quote here, and then
754740	759740	alright, so New York and Dan Harmon are urban
759740	768740	but they see, the thing is, these are supposed to be slides, so then it's
768740	772740	then it would, it would appear that the word uncompromising appeared underneath the word urban, but
772740	776740	instead it's just scrolling through, and
776740	780740	also my name, my first name's in all caps, because
780740	787740	the phone knows me that way, and it's urban, we're
787740	791740	we're urban, we're uncompromising, we're offended by 9-11
791740	798740	very much so, to the core, and we're efficient, but there's a triangle I couldn't get rid of
798740	802740	New York and Dan Harmon are okay, looking from a distance
802740	805740	but less so during the day
805740	812740	we are, we're up close, parts of us are beautiful, parts of us are scary and smell like pee
812740	818740	New York and Dan Harmon, you can tell what we just ate by looking at the ground around us
818740	823740	except in the case of me, that's like regular food, and New York just, they eat dreams
823740	828740	it eats dreams, this is New York the city, not a New Yorker, boy Harmon
828740	834740	oh, what, okay, what, wait, wait, is that it, that's the whole thing?
834740	836740	It loops, I didn't know they loop
836740	839740	yeah, all right, that's my, that's my slide show
844740	849740	all right, also I, you know, okay
849740	856740	all right, we'll later on, we'll, maybe we'll, I wish I could type better
856740	860740	oh, now that works, okay, all right, so we have some people we could meet too, but, but, but
860740	864740	only if I'm really, you know, well, we have one person we're gonna meet no matter what
864740	868740	but, and then another person if I'm like drowning
868740	872740	oh, that's, that's not very nice, now they'll have to figure out which is which
872740	876740	no, the first person is the person I'd like you to meet, the second person, if I bring them up
876740	880740	you know that that person is like somebody that I'm like, we're drowning
880740	884740	yeah, and then they have to know that, but they can use that
884740	887740	they can be self-effacing about that
887740	890740	yeah, I'm sure they'll use that to their advantage
890740	894740	yeah, I have some things that, okay, hold on a second
901740	905740	spatially this is a lot more complicated than we're used to
905740	907740	a lot of maneuvering
907740	909740	how are you enjoying this trip to New York?
909740	912740	oh, I hate it, I'm in deadline hell right now
912740	917740	after this, I'm sure to go back to continue working on the thing that we're supposed to shoot in a week
917740	921740	oh, but our second, our second guest, if we're drowning, is our blossom from CISO
921740	923740	so you could probably just ask him
923740	926740	yeah, just say, can we delay the show, but a week?
926740	928740	I hope we drown
928740	930740	because
930740	932740	also, I hope the show doesn't go that well
932740	936740	you're talking about Harman Quest second season is what you're talking about
936740	938740	yeah, yeah
938740	940740	yeah
942740	944740	okay, so some updates just
944740	950740	if you are a cookie collector 2 person that has joined my cookie collector 2 team
950740	953740	I didn't know there was a way, there was no way to kick people off
953740	955740	a lot of you, there can only be 50 people
955740	957740	there's a lot of freeloaders on your team
957740	959740	I don't know if you can figure out a way to leave the team
959740	963740	but if you could, if you've collected literally zero cookies
963740	965740	that's not how you play cookie collector 2
965740	967740	delete your account
967740	971740	I'm not an elitist, I'm not saying you gotta work hard and play hard
971740	973740	it's called cookie collector
973740	978740	it's called cookie collector, a lot of you, like 47 of you are taking up 47 of 50 slots
978740	980740	and you're collecting zero cookies
980740	982740	you can't rumble crumbs that way
982740	987740	but I'd also like to say the reason I don't appear to be collecting a lot of cookies right now
987740	990740	is because I'm building up bonuses, I keep prestigeing
990740	993740	okay, alright, so
993740	996740	what if that's what they're all doing though?
997740	1001740	but you can't do that without collecting, these people have collected zero cookies
1001740	1003740	okay, well I don't know the game
1003740	1009740	Dr. Henry Lee, a world famous forensic scientist
1009740	1014740	so this crazy thing, where is he based, I think he's based in California, we have to get him on the show
1014740	1018740	Dr. Henry Lee is amazing, there's a forensic files marathon happening right now
1018740	1022740	on the television
1022740	1027740	and like, Cody recorded him saying the same thing
1027740	1031740	she didn't have Tivo, she wasn't able to freeze it, it was just like a weird coincidence
1031740	1034740	we were like sharing the, you know, him and the John Bonet Ramsey thing
1034740	1037740	he's like, don't steal my papel
1037740	1044740	and then, you know, it's like, are you allowed to have fun with the fact that a guy speaks very very broken English
1044740	1048740	that ties into like, you know, it's like, are those days over?
1048740	1051740	I don't know if New York City understands that concept
1051740	1054740	it's like, where does it bleed into racism
1054740	1056740	the guy's English is very very funny
1056740	1060740	and that's linked to, whatever, he talks funny
1060740	1063740	but he can handle it, he's very very smart
1063740	1067740	and he speaks such funny English
1067740	1072740	and because of his job he has to talk about the grossest shit
1072740	1078740	and so Cody saw this clip and she taped it and it was Dr. Henry Lee
1078740	1081740	there was like a UV ray going over a bed
1081740	1083740	and there was just all this shit lighting up
1083740	1094740	and Dr. Henry Lee says, we found between 150 and 200 individual semen stains
1098740	1101740	that's a lot of semen stains
1103740	1104740	I always watched it over and over again
1104740	1107740	then we checked into our hotel and we turned on the forensic files marathon
1107740	1109740	and the same thing was playing
1109740	1114740	and we were like, oh my god, the same thing happened to me but with drivers, dine-ins and dives
1115740	1116740	oh shit
1116740	1118740	what's drivers, diamonds and dine?
1118740	1120740	well let's move on, it's fine
1120740	1125740	a show about cars that go into the ocean and the people that rescue their treasures?
1125740	1128740	yeah, hosted by Guy Fieri
1128740	1135740	anyways, that is a lot of semen stain
1135740	1140740	but I thought it was interesting that he had a sympathy for the devil kind of delivery on that
1140740	1142740	he's like, that's a lot of semen stain
1142740	1144740	and then it cut to a different thing
1144740	1146740	and I think what he said next is like
1146740	1148740	but, you know
1148740	1150740	or maybe he said, and I should know
1150740	1154740	I thought it sounded like sympathy for the bed, right?
1154740	1156740	I thought it was more like
1156740	1159740	I thought he would say, that he would say
1159740	1161740	that's a lot of semen stain
1161740	1164740	but that alone does not make man a bad person
1165740	1168740	special people generate semen
1168740	1172740	you may be bad person, you may be forensic genius
1173740	1176740	maybe that make you make more semen
1176740	1177740	I don't know
1179740	1182740	Cody killed her first fly today
1183740	1185740	was she not like killing bugs?
1185740	1187740	no, it wasn't that, that's what I thought
1187740	1189740	but she's just bad at it
1189740	1191740	she's never gotten to kill
1191740	1193740	there was a giant fly in the hotel bathroom
1193740	1196740	and she was relaying this all to me, I wasn't there
1196740	1199740	she injured it with a towel
1199740	1201740	and then it went into a crevice
1201740	1204740	so she sprayed it with hairspray
1204740	1205740	also nice
1205740	1208740	until it crawled out of the crevice
1208740	1210740	dizzy from its great hair
1210740	1212740	and then she finally smushed it
1212740	1214740	and it just made me think, can you imagine
1214740	1216740	because flies, they literally, correct me if I'm wrong
1216740	1220740	the common house fly, its lifespan is one day, right?
1220740	1222740	I doubt it, that's not true
1222740	1223740	I don't think so
1223740	1224740	maybe
1224740	1226740	do we have an armchair entomologist
1226740	1228740	down here that said no?
1231740	1234740	flies and like swamps live a day, someone said
1234740	1237740	well gnats surely, but flies are bigger than gnats
1237740	1240740	I thought they live a day, who thinks they know better
1240740	1242740	I'm sure some flies live a day, Dan
1242740	1245740	yeah, nobody's really willing to, we got a very delicate hand
1245740	1248740	coming up, you're not a delicate person
1248740	1251740	I'm saying your hand is delicate, sir
1251740	1255740	I'm saying it was a furtive, furtive
1257740	1258740	thank you
1258740	1261740	well they live a day as adults, they live longer as maggots
1261740	1264740	I see, I don't know about that either
1264740	1265740	alright, well
1265740	1268740	I'm just going to call bullshit on anything anyone says from here on out
1270740	1272740	this is a very risky thing for me to do
1272740	1274740	but it would probably happen if I didn't call for it
1274740	1277740	but if anybody were to find out
1277740	1280740	I heard someone yell out 28 days
1280740	1284740	28 days? Wow, that's a lot of semen stain
1286740	1289740	okay, 28 days, nevermind
1289740	1291740	what were you going to say?
1291740	1294740	these things live for a day and some of them get to live the perfect life
1294740	1297740	because there's turds everywhere and they love them
1297740	1303740	and then I was thinking so many of them just live in our definition of hell
1303740	1307740	because they are born and then they're probably an hour into their life
1307740	1312740	and then someone's just trying to swat them the whole time
1312740	1316740	and they're like, can I just please eat a little bit of that dried milk off that picnic table
1316740	1321740	or there's a horse tail that's constantly trying to kill them and their family
1321740	1325740	I don't know, but 28 days, they should figure it out
1325740	1328740	flies have had it too easy for too long
1328740	1332740	they have time to build a fly house
1334740	1340740	they don't deserve our sympathy insects because they're like the first type of organism
1340740	1342740	the first phylum?
1342740	1343740	no
1343740	1344740	first kingdom?
1344740	1345740	kingdom maybe
1345740	1347740	no, kingdoms are animal and
1347740	1352740	they're the first phylum to start nailing it as far as organization
1352740	1357740	because they're multicellular organisms that then got meta and fractal about it
1357740	1361740	and said what if these multicellular individuals worked in a colony
1361740	1363740	and were social and stuff
1363740	1366740	and so they've kind of perfected everything and then they got lazy
1366740	1370740	and they were just like, well, it's not like we're going to turn into lizards and then squirrels
1370740	1376740	and then monkeys and then the monkeys are going to hit a gazelle with a femur bone and make spaceships
1376740	1381740	but they were wrong and now they can eat our shit
1381740	1385740	and they're like, we love your shit and I'm like, yeah, protest more
1385740	1387740	that's how Planet of the Apes happened, right?
1387740	1389740	just a reminder
1389740	1391740	so, okay, hold on, with these bugs though
1391740	1395740	I always assume that bugs just like were little wind-up toys, right?
1395740	1399740	but people feel bad about killing bugs, like what's the consensus?
1399740	1401740	where does PETA stand?
1401740	1403740	I don't care what PETA stands for
1403740	1406740	that's a good way to get you some blown up
1406740	1409740	you know, well, you heard about this PETA thing, right?
1409740	1412740	about this new ad campaign that I was talking about
1412740	1414740	where they have the women say I was killed down and I was violated
1414740	1416740	and they go, surprise, I'm speaking for cows
1416740	1418740	for cows, yeah
1418740	1423740	yeah, and there were people, people's reactions to that included
1423740	1427740	I saw somebody on Twitter being like, this is over the line
1427740	1429740	PETA needs to be shut down
1429740	1433740	that is our problem, that's why our country is like suffering
1433740	1437740	because of people that, it's not because of all the shit that's going on
1437740	1443740	it's because we have successfully systematized the infantilization of ourselves
1443740	1447740	as a biomass, we're in our second or third generation of people that are just like
1447740	1450740	that's offensive, somebody's going to deal with that for sure
1450740	1454740	like, the teacher's not going to put up with that obnoxious person
1454740	1456740	as for me, I'll be over here getting straight A's
1456740	1458740	no, you're going to be over here sliding into the ocean
1458740	1461740	and there may be a Nazi elected in a day
1461740	1466740	and I'm just saying, we have to
1466740	1467740	what was that noise?
1467740	1470740	like, I get where it's coming from, but just specifically
1470740	1473740	the quality of the sound of that noise was very weird
1473740	1477740	I think someone said zuzza zuzza zuzza
1477740	1480740	I'm on that person's side because that is
1480740	1484740	I'm not against them, I want to understand, I'm here to grow
1484740	1488740	that's the Dairy Queen parfait of
1488740	1491740	stop saying he might get elected
1491740	1496740	and even if he doesn't, what the fuck are we going to do
1496740	1502740	and maybe I'm on the alt right in a Harman Town fan, I don't know
1502740	1505740	you certainly courted them heavily
1505740	1510740	well, that Vice Canada clip, they certainly made me look like an undecided voter
1511740	1513740	all I'm saying is everyone's full of shit
1513740	1518740	I'm not saying don't go out and stop this guy from Hitler-ing
1523740	1526740	he's from New York
1526740	1528740	he's a New York tradition
1528740	1537740	I know how you feel, I feel like New Yorkers have been sick of that guy for 35 years
1537740	1543740	and we're marveling when the Celebrity Apprentice happened
1543740	1547740	who in Wichita thought this was a good idea
1547740	1550740	anyways, we don't want to talk about that
1550740	1553740	we don't have anything else to talk about
1553740	1557740	we've all been hit over the head with a sack of potatoes
1557740	1560740	for a year and a half now this election's been going on
1560740	1563740	that's the new thing, that's what we've got going on
1563740	1568740	the problem obviously isn't the election because the President's got one power
1568740	1572740	I flipped out on Twitter recently because the one thing is the Supreme Court thing
1572740	1577740	that is why the President during their term, if any of these geezers kicks it
1577740	1581740	they replace them and they replace them along these party lines
1581740	1584740	it's already bad enough that we have this bipartisan system
1584740	1588740	where these guys are just playing human chess, and ladies playing human chess
1588740	1592740	congratulations
1592740	1596740	and now they're just like 5 year olds and they're fucking with the thing
1596740	1600740	this is fucking unconstitutional, I'm going to fucking kill myself
1600740	1602740	I'm going to kill myself
1602740	1605740	it's the only thing that's legal to say anymore, I'm going to kill myself
1605740	1608740	that's the thing, I'm going to kill all of you
1608740	1612740	I'm going to kill myself, that's code, I'm going to kill you
1612740	1617740	I'm going to live forever, every time I kill you I'm going to gain power like Highlander
1618740	1622740	and then I'll be able to, it's like will water in my head
1622740	1626740	but I can sense thoughts, what are you going to do in Highlander 2
1626740	1629740	I'm going to make an ozone shield, what?
1632740	1635740	that Highlander series, I'll tell you
1635740	1639740	they did not know what we wanted in Highlander 2
1639740	1643740	but I'm sure the writers sat down and were like, well it says there can only be one
1643740	1647740	and then there's one at the end, shit, pretty cool
1647740	1651740	they're from Mars, I don't know
1651740	1657740	our next guest is new to the Feral Audio Podcast family
1657740	1661740	and I know barely anything about her but I thought it would be a good chance to get to know her

1791740	1793740	oh my god
1793740	1795740	there's so much media out there
1795740	1797740	not enough time honestly
1797740	1798740	yeah no
1798740	1800740	everybody can't watch everything anymore
1800740	1801740	yeah it's sad
1801740	1803740	when I was your age
1803740	1805740	you could watch everything
1805740	1807740	and at the end of the night
1807740	1808740	around midnight
1808740	1811740	they would literally play the national anthem
1811740	1813740	and show a flag
1813740	1815740	and then it would go to static
1815740	1817740	there wasn't enough TV
1817740	1819740	it was insane
1819740	1820740	people would just like
1820740	1821740	die in their chairs
1821740	1822740	smoking cigarettes
1822740	1824740	watching static
1824740	1826740	the original Poltergeist movie
1826740	1827740	is all based on that
1827740	1830740	it's like oh that's when the ghosts come out of your TV
1830740	1832740	because we had nothing
1832740	1833740	Spielberg was like now what?
1833740	1835740	and there's like flipping channels
1835740	1838740	he's like what if a ghost was there?
1838740	1840740	there's not going to be anymore
1840740	1842740	Spielberg's because now there's too much to watch
1842740	1844740	the new Spielberg is hooked on
1844740	1846740	the fall
1846740	1848740	Netflix you watch the fall
1848740	1849740	so awesome
1849740	1850740	really?
1850740	1851740	Jillian Anderson
1851740	1852740	oh yeah
1852740	1854740	oh she's in rare form
1854740	1856740	yeah British
1856740	1858740	my favorite form
1858740	1860740	she's doing like an accent
1860740	1862740	or she was British the whole time
1862740	1863740	yeah she's British
1863740	1865740	in either case she's impressive
1865740	1868740	I don't understand how people can act in an accent
1871740	1873740	doesn't make sense
1874740	1876740	well give me an accent
1876740	1877740	Irish
1877740	1878740	Irish
1878740	1879740	and now give me a
1879740	1880740	Jerry Seinfeld
1886740	1888740	did you have her notice?
1891740	1893740	what's with chalalies?
1895740	1898740	that doesn't sound like something I'd hit you with
1898740	1900740	if you're going to hit someone with something
1900740	1902740	call it a hitter
1903740	1905740	don't call it something delightful
1905740	1908740	oh I'm going to pull out my chalalie
1909740	1912740	okay now this time you're upset with your wife
1912740	1913740	I'm upset
1913740	1915740	you're hard at work and she's coming in
1915740	1917740	she needs you know something it's important
1917740	1919740	it's not an unimportant thing that she needs
1919740	1921740	I'm upset with my wife and it's important
1921740	1922740	but she needs something
1922740	1923740	she needs something
1923740	1925740	but you're upset because you're overworked
1925740	1926740	and what am I? am I Irish?
1926740	1928740	you're Irish Jerry Seinfeld now
1928740	1931740	now you're acting in the accent you're just not acting in
1931740	1933740	all right well I need space work then
1933740	1934740	yes
1934740	1937740	working on a pair of boots
1937740	1939740	and then can you play my wife?
1939740	1941740	oh sorry I didn't mean to do that
1941740	1943740	and what nationality is she?
1943740	1944740	yeah
1944740	1947740	I think that taster's choice
1947740	1949740	do you have a favorite?
1949740	1951740	maybe cockney
1951740	1953740	cockney oh you're okay great
1953740	1957740	oh I'm sorry for breaking your car
1957740	1959740	I don't know that's not really good right
1959740	1963740	well I broke your car sorry
1963740	1965740	it's fine
1965740	1967740	it's fine
1967740	1971740	oh it don't seem fine in it
1979740	1981740	it's just frustrating
1981740	1983740	observing
1983740	1987740	saying what people are thinking
1987740	1989740	making boots
1995740	1997740	boy
1997740	1999740	I can't stay mad at you
2003740	2005740	nice
2005740	2007740	autistic masterpiece theater
2009740	2011740	so what did you learn?
2011740	2013740	I didn't mean that because we were flapping our arm
2013740	2015740	that was not a flapping joke
2015740	2017740	that was a I mean a personal space joke
2017740	2021740	that was an empowering solidarity thing
2021740	2023740	I was taking it back
2027740	2029740	yes
2029740	2033740	so that's another thing New York and Dan Harman and Evan Cowan we can take things back
2033740	2037740	so from that experience did you learn how to act in an accent?
2037740	2040740	like what can you tell us now because you're the only person who's actually done it
2040740	2046740	I just don't think I know I feel I find myself having to choose between the accent and the acting
2046740	2053740	I don't know like like how can you because they both require pretending that you're something else that's not true
2053740	2060740	so I don't understand these people like people from Australia will be going soon and New Zealand actors like we're flooded with them
2060740	2067740	and they're brilliant actors and they they just learn from childhood if they're going to be an actor that the brass ring is maybe involves going to the states
2067740	2070740	because that's where the market you know has the most jobs
2070740	2075740	and and so they from a very young age I think they're just it's just like oh yeah and then here's your American accent
2075740	2081740	which I don't know it must just be practice it's like like you could raise a baby on a skateboard maybe
2081740	2088740	and it would probably be like Tony Hawk when it was 13 and then I mean we've tried that right yeah like I have
2088740	2093740	well that's that's the Olympics that's all these freakish children who are like they've all been since since three years old
2093740	2103740	they've been like pushed along equipment and stuff and then they're like I'm 13 and I'm crying because I didn't do a rhythm gymnast thing right
2103740	2111740	yeah who can't identify with that scenario and then there's like an old like Belgian guy on the side that's like you did it wrong
2111740	2123740	you cost my nation gold is the Olympics still like that that's what it was like when I Belgian it's all Belgian it's all Belgian coaches
2123740	2132740	no all countries they're all Belgium oh yeah why I hate the Olympics you guys yeah
2133740	2141740	bite your tongue I just why why are we gonna do it well I mean was there's probably a quarter of those events are like actually you know
2141740	2150740	interesting in any way and then there's like horse dressage like like what makes the cut off how do we determine what's important
2150740	2158740	this now sounds like a stand-up bit but I'm just confused the answer is just committee thinking like that as far as like some
2158740	2169740	some country will probably say I wish we of Malta we think that semaphore should be an Olympic sport right and then and then the committee
2169740	2182740	probably says like well it'll seem to me as a senator Olympic Senator Johnson speaking your country has more semaphore than any other country
2182740	2194740	so are you trying to cheat your way into a gold medal there or you plan to compete with the globe in the spirit of humanity well both we want to be good at something and we
2194740	2202740	want to we want to we want to also participate that's that whole thing the Olympics are about us getting together it's about a united planet
2202740	2211740	defeat other countries yeah we do that by swimming better than each other yeah that's dumb I hate it that that comes from a time when the only other time
2211740	2221740	we hung out with other countries so we were murdering them and like like like fucking the holes like that we stabbed with spears right like like we were just like
2221740	2231740	monsters like if you saw a person who spoke a different language you were like that encounter did not stop until there were tendons exposed and so then it was like fun that we were
2231740	2248740	playing ping pong together that's a little outdated in this age of smart bombs and dumb children oh shit hate to get too political downsizing and uploading uploading and downsizing
2248740	2263740	I did the same thing but in the reverse order okay up sizing and downloading there we go that's great worth it I guess I'm I guess the thing that scares me about about the alt right movement is that I am a Jew loving
2263740	2277740	intellectual that like is gonna just have all of his property taken away from him and and just like I've spent 20 years working yeah and I thought I thought I'd get got to have stuff at the end of that
2277740	2292740	right which I guess is all anybody's ever saying so then some people who spent 20 years working and didn't get anything for it that now then then they get to be Nazis and then they're like Nazi time and I'm like hold on a second I spent 20 years
2292740	2313740	preparing for non Nazi time thank you I think we'll be fine just as long as Obama doesn't take all our guns well I'd like to see him try I'd like to see him try like that that could be a reality show Obama's America taking guns from people
2313740	2343700	well now that his job has become late night talk show appearances he should just he should do a bit on Letterman or do it there's no Letterman so sad he should he should do a Kimmel bit where he go where he goes door to door and tries to take people's guns be funny he'd be very charming I'd give him my gun even if I loved my gun and had a gun I'd give him my gun he's so charming oh yeah we're gonna miss that mm-hmm I'm gonna miss Joe Biden that's like I mean Obama's great but Joe Biden he's like you
2343700	2373180	know he's he's just fun times Joe just wanted what's that guy up to you know I guess we could still do that I will I'm gonna make it my mission to find out what Joe Biden is up to did you see that clip where he like he's reacting to the big the new email resurgence thing and then he's in and he's a clip where he's in the middle of an interview and they're bringing it up and he's like what's that again what's going on look whatever this is wherever it came from and they're like Anthony Weiner he's like Jesus Christ
2373180	2402100	that's such an organic reaction it's it's great that was everyone's reaction as that information came out Mary have hula hand am I pronouncing that right yes okay it's not like how how a hand Oh God no are you must be familiar with hot lips hula hand from mash yeah name it anyway sure sure yeah is that an Irish name what is that yeah have you been to Ireland I wish
2402740	2407820	have you no and by the way you're not allowed to wish until you get there
2411500	2431540	or is that is that wait is it wishing no that's genies you gotta kiss a rock you have to capture a leprechaun you will they go the leprechaun will give you a wish if you catch them no that's the pot of gold right no if you know the pot of gold gold it'll give you a genie you can buy a genie with the pot of gold and get a wish
2432660	2460100	I think it's that you get a wish if you catch a leprechaun but most people by default wish for the pot of gold well could you ask for more than a pot of gold no two pots I hate magic two two thoughts is it two pots of gold two pots of gold yeah that's what I'm saying I'm sure there's some variants you know in in Ireland they everything's a fairy yeah really yeah like monsters are fairies like everything's a fairy like they're
2460100	2490060	words they're when they say fairy they don't mean like a little thing with wings goblins are fairies that are caps are fairies where guard dwarves gnomes they're all fairies elves are fairies orcs are fairies goblins I probably said goblins right spriggins are fairies the word fairy is to the supernatural to the Irish what the word pudding is to the British in terms of food like it's just all desserts are pudding
2491020	2514020	and all I could have just said that I didn't need to because no one needs to there's nothing that needs to be clarifying I'm an over analoger I'm an analogaholic in what way well it's like this if analogs were like what are you I have no home
2514020	2542380	that clears it up and then I and then I do too many analogs do you do you drink do you like a knowledge very little hand are you young enough to ask how old you are mm-hmm how old 26 hmm so that's that's a I almost use the word ripe it says you can you go ahead you can
2542380	2572140	use ripe for old people a ripe old age is fine but you can't what a ripe young lady she's a ripe she's just so ripe old people are probably over ripe at that point I think well yeah but I think we flatter them it's it's like saying take them out early I saw I remember when there was a commercial for wheel of fortune when I was a kid and and it's it was a it's a great show for the young and it showed like a kid playing wheel of fortune and then it got to an old lady spinning the wheel
2572220	2599980	to the young at heart I always thought that was a funny yeah that still happens I think I still hear that occasionally yeah young at heart yeah or they say like she's a hundred years young a hundred years ripe we're ashamed of death like we think that death means even though it's something that all of us have to do not me we think it's oh shit maybe maybe not you that's the thing we're getting closer yeah getting closer to turing's
2599980	2629980	para para parabolic tipping point where where where people won't age anymore because we'll be robot brains something like that well good for you yeah I'm sure your power points will be amazing it sucks that they all have to die but everyone oh everyone 27 and over yeah that when you were born they handed you like a comic-con sign like like that's where it's so everybody
2629980	2659980	behind you knew that they wouldn't get a signature oh wait no that doesn't make any sense that's the people in front of you that age more well it's like that but backwards right yeah it doesn't make sense but that is what happens they said could you go tell everyone older than you they're gonna die and you're like that's a shitty gig and they're like after you're done you get eternity to hang out and do key keynotes Ted talks but everyone watching will be able to live forever yeah but they'll still want to hear you say stuff
2659980	2689980	what are we supposed to want to stay alive are we supposed to is it like hope not I haven't for years because I'm already starting to get 43 I'm kind of like I'm not I'm not gonna say like oh I'd be stoked to die but I'm I'm like I'm I can feel it starting to yeah yeah me too I can tell by 53 I'll be like yeah or we could die like when someone do when we're arguing about where to go to eat like like Taco Bell or
2689980	2719980	McDonald's yeah or die yeah like not that that conversation ever happens should we go to Taco Bell or McDonald's I don't know why I'm laughing at that everyone in Wichita is like that's every night like wait wait wait wait wait sorry you live in Los Angeles where there's a restaurant new restaurant opens every night you fucking rich sack of crap we have to choose which cock gunner food comes out of because we have two jobs and children you fucking gross elitist prick sorry
2719980	2749980	sorry Wichita why are you listening aren't you part of that big red part with all the what is got do you care about politics sounds about right I think about it a lot but it makes me mad are you gonna miss vine kid like yourself you must have grown up on vine right yeah can you do something for six seconds like that you would do on vine and
2749980	2779980	if it was still around yeah can we see it okay I'll say start when the vine starts I guess and then and then I'll say loop when it's over so then if you want you can do it again okay so start oh this is a Stevie Nicks loop sorry that's her yeah you probably reshoot it in that case if that happened I think I think what I did is I said my mistake is I said start two three
2779980	2809980	four so I'll do it again and I'll do one so okay start this is Ray Romano and he's a piece of bread run loop is a piece of bread right that's probably we could probably do that on Instagram now if we don't need well that's what yeah that's why it happened for vine yeah poor Twitter boy but for buying vine poor Google for buying
2809980	2839980	poor mobile oil for buying Time Warner AT&T and Google it says as a so 9-11 mm-hmm what happened we were here yeah oh we're fired oh is she cuz her microphone keeps so nice this is a good chance for me to switch over to cool are you gonna start typing no

3088060	3116060	god damn it fucking cock fuck oh shit okay I said cock fuck not cocksucker that's politically correct it's it's denigrating you know anyone can suck a cock Dan it's not like insulting oh my god you're right thank you I'll be here tomorrow it's sexist it's not homophobic to say
3116060	3145860	cocksucker it's sexist to think it's not all right to say cocksucker I just think it's funny like it's just a funny image and that's that's it like I'm like yeah I could suck a cock that'd be funny but if you're talking to a guy and he says oh here's your fries and you're like these are late and he's like fuck you and you're like fuck you cocksucker you're saying to that guy as another guy fuck you I'm not on your team and what's here's some things that are bad about you you suck cock
3146860	3160860	so that's bad if they because whether the guy's gay or not you've denigrated a section of the popular that's enough that's in the attitude right it's in the attitude yeah you said fuck you you're not like oh thanks for the fries cocksucker you know that'd be fine
3160860	3187860	we're all just trying to work it out so speaking of things that are like not so so like I don't know like like what like I don't know what's politically correct or not when you're talking about like when you want like it's I think Spencer would like to make love to more women well I mean who doesn't right
3187860	3216860	and he's also in the in his mid 20s and I'm not going where you think I'm going yeah what the fuck that no that's tipping your hand too early Harmon I don't want to I don't know where where I don't know where the paths go into hashtag rape culture when you're like wing manning in public when you're like someone should fuck my friend well I think you're just you know doing what no one asked you to do really no I know you didn't ask me to do it I'm also being a bad friend
3217860	3244860	I know that but I just like fair enough I think I think you know like Spencer's never gonna make the first move so you should gang up in a minute and also not true I mean it's not like I'm always gonna make them I mean yeah I don't want why is this happen I'm sorry I'm sorry it's fine let's can we bring out let's bring out
3244860	3273860	the show's going great so let's bring out a head of see so Evan Shapiro oh shit oh shit he was quick this guy's like the king of new media and he won't have a microphone oh cuz we had there a broken one hey cocksucker where do you stand in calling a calling someone a cock
3274860	3304820	cocksucker oh god I usually don't what insults do you usually employ oh that's a good question yes it is depends on the intelligence of the person I'm talking it's okay thank you cuz I will tell you when I was in my 20s and the world was different and I if I would get really mad at another man like I would go like full bald when like Glenn Gary Glenn Ross and and and further like like
3304820	3322820	a lot of man-on-man insults that aren't woke are they they revolve around the mass elation of the other guy and it's like and so you call him the C word and you call him and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and the and the my favorite was always the TW word
3322820	3352820	yeah two Tweedle Dee twain the twain shall we meet mother cocksucker no you know it rhymes with with the second part of robot yeah I know the word yeah okay yeah I want are you trying to get me to say it no no no it was my favorite it was like like if I was I'm not really comfortable I'm not really comfortable with with that word although we just did a show with
3352820	3382740	a comic and the name of the show was American cunt right and so in the office for a couple of days you know the email filter would would catch capture it or it was you know do you say that title in mixed company in the workplace right you're the boss in the UK like yeah it's it's a word the equivalent of like I don't know asshole kind of yeah kind of hello can't it's designed for that for that sweet almost so wait let me ask you this cuz your cure it you're you're you're you're
3382740	3411060	running see so it's comedy and so there's it's like we're living in this world now where comedy has come to a four-way stop sign with multicultural awareness and like people trying to evolve into a Roddenberry vision of the future and like there's there's like in the comedy is about irony irony is about incongruency with expectation sometimes it's about shocking people etc like I I go with the definition I think I think Jim Norton said
3411060	3440900	like just nobody try to be shocking on purpose and nobody try to be polite on purpose that's you not being funny if you make yourself laugh and stuff I would go with that that makes sense to me but as a person who's in charge of who gets a stand-up special and who doesn't where does your opinions come in and how do you employ them well I think that the hard part is is that in a culture where the woman can go on stage and and be married to the largest cyber bully on earth
3440900	3470860	and unironically lecture us about cyber bullying how do you how are you funny you know how does someone respond to that and actually make fun of that in real time because you're watching the world turn meta on its head right in front of you and it's very difficult to to react to that in a way that just doesn't seem you know even more ironic things are moving so fast I have no idea what you're talking about I don't even know that's well so I think what's happened now is that you're seeing something like this
3470860	3499420	where somebody gets up and is entirely confessional for an hour without necessarily having a script has become one of the coolest ways to do comedy and so I think what you're doing here and with and podcasting in general you know with your I don't know what your podcast is about me neither it's great what is it called Mary hoolahan it's called what's up it's Mary hoolahan that's the name of it and you just had your first show today right was that it oh yeah yeah how to go oh my god
3499420	3528620	incredible they were all there oh shit thank you it's a big studio yeah my living room hey by the way Spencer hey you can't push back the start of the show yeah no I know okay that's why you know where I'm gonna be right after this you're gonna be writing yes who's it who's who's gonna be on the show next week oh who's gonna be on the show next week I don't think we can say yeah yeah we can say
3529420	3558260	it's it's possible that these people might drop out again yeah we've had a lot of problems book we've had a lot of problems making our request to know but we put up extra scenes on Thursday oh yes yeah expanded universe you should check it out it's the parts that we wish we could have kept in the show but had to cut for time because we wanted it to be short there's a whole there's a whole do you there's a whole wrestling match with Paul of Tompkins
3558420	3576980	oh yeah do you guys mean to imply that things have to sometimes be shaved from a from a it's all genius it's all genius down right oh have a nice
3576980	3606300	because it just makes me think of how I'm so tired of having to choose how to shave is this a sponsor no no what what are you talking what do you think we're bought and sold but just talking about our personal experience with various products we interact with Spencer when was the last time you shaved oh I shaved my whole beard
3606300	3623180	because I was going Hollywood Spencer you might have heard the ad well not you you guys but yeah I grew it back how long wait seriously how long did it take you to grow that beer but this is like a seven year beard a seven year that's a seven year a seven year
3623180	3651180	like it leave these leave these laptops his broad browsers home page is the IGN calm leave these leave these like a little care bear he's like he doesn't have a ounce of hatred in his heart like I'm sure mine is Pornhub premium it has to be premium as a premium page I don't know I mean that's urgent
3653180	3682180	so anyways I mean pictures of men shaving yeah you at you at home listening it's it's pictures of men shaving because here's the thing about shaving and women shave too and and really and there's no such thing as gender so this is a commercial for humanity
3682180	3711180	Dollar Shave Club calm lets you the human end user reach out into the world and use digital technology to have shaving equipment delivered to your door it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's an unholy union of prehistoric needs and and modern fulfillment if you just go to Dollar Shave Club calm slash harm in town I believe you'll get a deep deep
3711180	3740180	discount that will you can try you get a free trial just pay shipping yeah and they pass the shavings on to you I just I just coined that you didn't write that in advance no so whether you have a beard that you don't like or you have one that you like and you want to spend some time apart from it or whether you don't want one and you're afraid one's about to come up with you
3740180	3769180	you're afraid one's about to happen or whether there's no chance of you having one but you're you're you live in a part of a patriarchy that demands that other parts of your body be be hair free you know like or maybe hey maybe you don't maybe you're offended by that maybe you choose to be hairless and it's an expression of your of yourself in any case you got a shave and and so why invite the Gillette's and Bix and needless trips to the girl that's going on
3769180	3786180	that's not that's not personal that's not convenient that's not intimate and that's certainly not millennial there's nothing less millennial than trying to break into that locked up razor fortress at the drug store yeah what does that say like we want you to have this but we don't trust you with it you might
3786180	3813180	hijack the store with a razor like like like oh you're a terrorist it's going to take over the grocery store by having the first blade pressed down the skin and have the second blade lifted with a third clips leaving behind a smooth strip of that's not how terrorism works and it's not how shaving should work and hey look I I don't know I'm no expert on capitalism but I don't think I don't think our advertisers would want us to exclude terrorism tears from there and I don't think that's what we're going to do
3813180	3840180	I think they might they might want to exclude them I've seen pictures of these guys they need to shave you would you you you think you think dollar shave is okay with terrorists buying their razors according to science as long as they use them to shave as from what I learned in 10th grade science the definition of like what we do we cannot say for sure that their lack of shaving is causing them to blow things up however we do not know what we're doing
3840180	3865180	with things up however we do not know that there is not a cause-effect relationship until we do an experiment like going to dollarshaveclub.com slash harmontown if you are feeling terroristic today look in the mirror are you are you beardy do you know for a fact that the beard is not telling you like to hate America I don't I don't I hate America I don't know what's I don't
3865180	3895140	know does your beard does your beard tell you to hate America I don't know I can't I don't speak beard so yeah yeah your beard tells you to hate America yeah that's why I chose the executive blade choose your own blade yeah so dollar shave club.com slash harmontown that's right they're gonna love that well there's so there's you know there's you know what's fucked up with the society I typed in man shaming

4143420	4173420	that would otherwise murder me or or or do you think it's encouraging them to keep feeling murdery both I think I think sports and and other group communal activities help us escape yeah absolutely okay gin sports you know I'm I've been an Eagles fan since I was born basically yeah let's see what happens tomorrow let's see what happens tomorrow but but but I don't it's not there's not a rational I don't I don't have a rational reason for rooting for the
4173420	4203420	Eagles I've lived in New York 27 years and and they suck most of the time or they break my heart every every year and yet I keep going back I'm just I'm sorry I'm I'm I'm I typed my name into Google they're just there they're excited you're googling yourself yeah which I haven't done in a long time what's the first thing it comes up well there's there's oh looks like you purchased a little ad here now that's an ad in my Wikipedia page there's my Twitter go to your
4203420	4233420	TV I'm Dan Harmon and my AMA Dan Harmon poops my my outdated blog my story structure Wow it used to check out that Twitter which is what's that click on that Twitter rant what's that about it's angry abusive that doesn't sound like you that's that's a year ago that's a year ago makes him seem deeply unhappy file this one under comedy with two question marks first off none of this is safe for work in any way I don't know
4233420	4263300	printing it because if you scroll down you will be reading some language in italics language is not the burden of not safe for work who's like looking oh that text is naughty you are fired mister second off if you worship Dan Harmon creator of community and Rick and Marty you might want to stop here because even your fellow Harmon worshippers think it makes him look really small the story here is that Harmon was on a plane yesterday
4263460	4292100	oh yeah I remember this and someone insulted him on Twitter this happens to famous people all the time it even happens to non-famous people all the time Twitter is essentially a cauldron of self-promotion links and insults and there is no escape Dan Harmon has surely went to Twitter before it's part of the shitty bargain this time though something's not this time and he caved to a dark desire to quote inflict genuine pain unquote
4292100	4321460	unfortunately his nemesis has protected all his her tweets so we can't see the original spark oh come on Harmon's responses tell us plenty all by themselves update from the comments here's the unforgivable incendiary tweet that said Harmon oh shit okay I guess you're drunker than expected that's okay but this isn't that great of an idea yeah that's a fucking shitty person who would respond to a tweet like that okay I guess you're drunk but whatever not a good idea fuck you let the pain begin
4322100	4352100	I barely remember this but I'm now remad at that guy so I said by the way going through a divorce for fucking a drunk I'm on a plane fuck you my Twitter my internet my planet I'm fucking Dan Harmon I'm not a goddamn politician I said that those people are terrible fucking people I don't I don't I don't I'm not running for election fuck you don't talk to me shitty you're gonna get talked to shitty back if I'm gonna
4352100	4382100	a bad mood it happens every day every day it happens every day even the non-famous fucking senator man like fuck you fuck all of you so fucking mad and then these days people worse over right now there's so it's sitting politicians politicians that do much worse and it's not a problem at all like they're like oh let's stop you know minorities from voting well that's true I mean there's been politicians threatening other politics yeah I didn't get drunk and get on a plane and say I have an idea all Mexicans are
4382100	4412100	rapists let's build a wall around America right like that that would be like Dan Harmon got drunk the other day and revealed that he's a fucking racist and a Nazi and I thought like no Dan Harmon got drunk and revealed something he reveals when he's sober which is that he's a dick and you shouldn't fuck with him like he was just he was just more in the mood to fuck with you back than to play cookie collector like like I'm sure this is pre cookie collector right so I don't know I just all I did I Kevin Spacey the guy like I just leaned into him like
4412100	4442100	fucking let him have it that's a verb is there a wrap-up there's a wrap-up like after oh it goes on from there and you can revisit the whole debacle at Harmon's Twitter thank God slash Dollar Shave Club if you want to discount the interesting thing here oh is it interesting is that the his victim's Twitter handle was bird person which is a Rick and Morty character so he's at least nominally a Harmon fan nominally well if they follow you on Twitter I mean they're already at least
4442100	4472100	nominally a fan oh oh yeah every single person that says shitty stuff to me is always following me everywhere every person that always says hey shut up you're fat and you're drunk and you're stupid and no one cares about your opinion I always go over in the midst of blocking them and right next to the block button is a fucking following you icon and I always want to go like this is insane if you're fucking you wonder why I'm leaving behind a planet that is going to burn into a cinder well but Twitter's just being water but that's the point is that Twitter's become a bit masochistic you follow people so that you can get angry
4472100	4502100	at them so that you can evoke some kind of reaction oh yeah and that's all fine that's all fair play I've never in my life like tried to ban somebody or complain or be like what's going on on Twitter this is not this should be illegal someone should shut PETA down I I don't I don't suffer the illusion that my problems are the problems of the fucking society around me I don't wait for anybody to fix my shit I just like if somebody says fuck you I'm like no fuck you probably maybe but do you know if I'm coming out of therapy I'm like thank you like for five minutes I'm like oh yeah maybe I should fuck me I guess
4502100	4532100	it's a good point I won't side with the split I should engage in some self-care I'm gonna go shower now but do you is there have you ever posted something in one of these that you regret he regretted this for a while then he stopped I well I regretted the whole experience but that's different from remorse like where you're like I feel I shouldn't have done that like I don't know I still forgive myself for for for I'm a human being that's on Twitter I don't I remorse is like I really I acknowledge
4532100	4562100	my crime and I fucking like like I feel terrible that that that happened like regret is like oh shit that turned into a shitstorm if I went back in time I'd avoid it because it didn't profit anybody I don't know fine line but but remorse involves this person that started this shit not feeling like a piece of shit and I'm not willing to go to that world yet I don't care if they're 15 I don't care if they have one arm I don't fucking care they're a dick and they and and of an encounter with me and and a
4562100	4592100	their brush with fame that resulted from it changes their perspective on society's construction then I've either done a favor or contributed to their fucking gross soup that is our society and in either case they're probably proud of that moment that they probably have that like that that thing framed on their walls so the conclusion is so what the hell just happened you're the journalist obviously we witnessed an incredible explosion of insecurity narcissism and anger from a man who is both creatively talented thank you
4592100	4622100	see that's these are my worst enemies and they still call me talented that's the fucking best I've never had like nobody ever ever was like that talented guy as an asshole I'm like I can't it's both creatively talented and insanely thin-skinned Oh Heaven for Fend that I'd be receptive and have a fucking empathy more than anything my takeaway is that Dan Harmon is deeply unhappy I love a good trolling
4622100	4652100	but this no you don't category within like three tweets hopefully this is a passing moment of counterproductive chest-thumping for Harmon and not the start of an emotional breakdown that ends with him smashing into walls in an asylum I mean so that that what are we in that's or welling in to say that hopefully hopefully this person being publicly vulnerable on social media and the resulting click
4652100	4682100	be articles talking about how he's having a meltdown don't result in government intervention someone should shut Peter down dude someone started Peter so you'd say that they're already doing their job go start anti-peta do something fucking schmuck like what the fuck man so it's really the comments comments here's a screenshot of a pretty inacuous original tweet but you know we already said that oh so they didn't research
4682100	4712100	that someone posted in the comment they up that's what they said I hate this shit people write an article that's literally just someone's tweets and then some it's like if I told you about something that happened on Twitter and then got paid a hundred bucks for it but this person is talking about the person responding by the way I never read a single response from this person apparently they said English wasn't their first language and they apologize how the chemical I didn't read anything from them I was like I was just typing 140 characters at a time about how they were a piece of shit Jesus that poor kid man I don't know
4712100	4742100	man apparently definitely sick parents you are worthless but this is this person's quoting me you are worthless but unnecessary byproduct of an evolutionary strategy summarizable as no wrong answers to which this person responds bleh good one Dan fancies himself some sort of insulting savant but the only jab I found particularly inspired was your Pistons are generic fears
4742100	4772100	the Roger Ebert of insults with I am Sarah Silverman's complete lack of surprise Dan Harmon is gonna click see more Dan Harmon has quite a few personality disorders apparently stemming from an abusive childhood he is also an alcoholic and perhaps even a drug addict
4772100	4802100	and although he is a creative genius fucking egg these are my enemies that would be like if during the debates like Hillary Clinton was like okay I get it he'd make a great president but still I win pouring his pain and dysfunctions into his work if you are familiar with his work you will notice how many of his characters are projections of either himself his hopes or his fears what a
4802100	4832100	shallow bag of tricks his process is very uneven although this person may be defending me his process is very very uneven and because of his I believe this is probably Todd Vanderworth from the onion in an anonymous account his process is very uneven and because of his many issues he is very hard to work with okay here we go yeah having constant breakdowns and anxiety attacks and being plain abusive to the point that his now
4832100	4862100	wife Erin has more was more a caregiver and handler than a spouse and partner in the traditional sense so no surprise that she finally called it quits because you can only take so much abuse and that's the point that sad little trolls like Joffrey who feel the need to use the name of one of the most hated D bags and all the fandoms because he thinks it gives him some sort of Reddit street cred wait I don't even know who they're talking about now am I Joffrey or is the no idea that's the person that tweeted me Joffrey I gotta back up so so no surprise
4862100	4892100	that she finally called it quits because you can only take so much abuse and that's the point that sad little toll trolls like Joffrey who feel the need to use the same feel the need to use the name of one of the most hated D bags and all of the fandoms because he thinks it gives him some sort of Reddit street cred but in fact only shows how desperate for attention they are don't get okay so this person's saying don't stop stop poking Dan Harmon it's because you think him slapping you as attention that'll make you happy it won't there are people who are
4892100	4922100	assholes because they choose to or because they are too lame this person can't spell for shit to be something better and then there are people who are assholes because they suffer from mental illness personality disorders and have a ton of real fucked up issues to deal with thank you these are the people that can barely function and if you inform yourselves a little bit about Dan Harmon you will realize he is one of said people he is barely functional he is a sick person that happens to be a creative genius
4922100	4952100	if not he would probably be living on the streets like so many untreated addicts of mental patients and all the people who don't get that are just a fucking ignorant cruel reflection of how our society treats people with social disorders mental illness personality disorders and drug addiction by punishing them humiliating them like they chose to be that way like they're very exist did I write this was I so drunk that I logged in and I was like why do you keep
4952100	4982100	that I should be on the streets if you hate me so much like they're very existence is annoying to them and they should just get over their issues to make your selfish lives better Dan Harmon is an asshole but at least he has medical issues to explain why he is this way and just to make all the jealous hatters feel better feel better hatters feel better and they're and they're
4982100	5012100	hearing like I'm like I'll spell a couple things wrong I like shopping in Ramsey's mom I'm like I'll just throw a couple extra teas in here and they're having ways he lives in constant pain and anxiety I mean I must be an expert at deflecting it because I'm fucking deliriously happy he he is a very unhappy lonely man that hurts and pushes away everyone around him because that's just how fucked up he is that he can't have a basic normal healthy relationship and sooner or later he is
5012100	5042100	gonna self-destruct while the world watches and I think that will be at the Gramercy Theatre at 4 p.m. signed Steve Levy I bet if we check that IP address it comes right from inside my house it's Steve Levy it's coming from inside the house yeah I don't I mean it's what what so I okay I mean like what what do you mean I'm a creative genius I'm not functional I'm functioning so well he said he
5042100	5069340	called you a creative genius twice though and I'm functioning so highly that you're fucking like writing more than I am like I'm getting paid obscene amounts of money to self-destruct and this is more than I've written all week I didn't do this much on dr. Strange I just went in there and ate a pizza and was like yeah it's cool he's kind of like Rick
5072100	5072940	let's not forget harm is the first stages of a divorce that's true okay so here's the thing I mean I want to make sure to clarify like I'm not excite like I very much explained that before that Twitter thing and I never looked at the kids responses I wasn't talking to him I very clearly said this guy caught me at the wrong time I'm fucking I'm and my therapist had warned me she said people that are going through divorce like it doesn't matter the circumstances of the divorce it doesn't matter fair unfair it's like it's such a it like raises up you're like weird you have to
5102100	5132100	you become hyper vigilant about injustice so like you'll just like you like anything that seems unfair to you you'll just like freak out whether it's unfair to people in a corner talking like I and then I went and experienced it but and I and I was I was like I was this is what's happening like I'm like this person's gonna get a beat down because they disagreed with me they told me and I'm like I need to inflict pain right now and then I just I tweeted a bunch of stuff I don't know the person so how can I possibly be hurtful I'm the non-anonymous one I'm the one that everyone
5132100	5162100	gets to call fat and alcoholic and just bring up my fucking own is white this person's like an expert on my marriage and they're just walking away clean they can write all that and they're mentally healthy this person is a fucking like this person's a therapist right this person's in charge of how other people should feel and their response to stranger on Twitter having a bad day is that my wife had to feed me pudding because I'm like that's fucking rude and judgmental and if I tweeted something like that at somebody else it would be incredibly petty and everyone would be like
5162100	5192100	you think breaking bad so good how come your marriage sucks it would be like the end of my career it would be the end of my career because it wouldn't just be me going like fuck you fuck you people are gross jerks I'm a fucking I'm in a bad mood everyone's a piece of shit asshole I'm just like Hannibal Lecter I'm locked in a cell all I can do is talk about fava beans I can't like eat you quid pro quo Clarice
5192100	5222100	if you listen to me and work with me I will direct you to a storage unit that will solve a lot of your case for you there is a place where a guy for some reason is storing a head in a jar conspiracy carrot the voice of a generation like this guy community sucks shit flavored dick that's like the that is like that is like the
5222100	5252100	works and wreck of insults of community what's more amazing to me is how anyone can go anywhere on the internet and not flip out like this how I love you Ben Hinman eight months ago Ben Hinman that sounds familiar no I was it sounds a lot like Dan Harmon oh did I spend the whole show what am I what's Steve Levy's clock says 223 does that mean oh is that it's time for a wrap we got a wrap
5252100	5282100	how can people walking away from this go experience more cockney and more reserved but polite and possibly very cool assuredly funny and smart because you're on Feral audio shenanigans you can follow me on the web at Mary
