0	4520	Back, finally, in Hollywood, California, from our excursion in New York City and some of
4520	6880	the craziest shit we've ever really purported.
9520	11640	Hormontown is now in session!
11640	19360	Let's bring us Spencer Crittenden, please.
19360	21160	Spencer to the stage.
24160	25520	We've missed you, Spencer.
25520	31520	And the mayor of Hormontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.
35520	36520	Thank you very much.
36520	37520	Thank you.
44520	48520	I can tell you have a weird energy.
48520	54520	You're thinking, uh-oh, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad got a divorce.
54520	57520	And now the shave happens.
57520	60520	But this was an absolute accident.
60520	63520	I went drunk into a barber shop in New York.
63520	67520	It was like, I did want to get a trim, but I've never gotten a trim from a barber.
67520	69520	So he said, what number?
69520	73520	And I said, one.
73520	75520	You just said, aim in the dark?
75520	76520	Yeah.
76520	78520	Well, I looked at his face and said, I'll have what you're having.
78520	79520	He had like a beard.
79520	83520	But he was a younger gentleman with black.
83520	86520	So for him, this looks like a beard.
86520	94520	But for me, now I look like a strange lab rat that's going through a George Michael phase.
97520	99520	You know that phase.
99520	101520	But no, don't worry.
101520	103520	Dad's fine.
103520	106520	He's still jerking off on mannequin legs.
106520	109520	And making breakfast.
109520	112520	And everything's going to be fine.
112520	114520	The dogs don't seem too happy.
114520	118520	Nigel keeps shitting everywhere and eating everything.
118520	120520	But that's sad.
120520	121520	Does he eat his own poop?
121520	124520	Because that would be a self-solving problem.
124520	125520	Yeah, I know.
125520	126520	I wish.
126520	127520	Yeah, of all the things.
127520	129520	Yeah, it's like he's running out of shit to eat.
129520	131520	It's all turning into shit, yeah.
131520	133520	Yeah, yeah.
133520	136520	Put it in the New Yorker, Harmon.
136520	137520	I know.
137520	140520	I thought, well, I do think in all seriousness probably.
140520	145520	Well, I'm not going to blame myself for the bad mood unless you guys heard us talking shit about LA and in the New York shows.
145520	147520	Sometimes we go to different cities and we're like, fuck those guys.
147520	149520	We're just kidding.
149520	153520	But if you're like me, you're a little wind was taken out of your sails.
153520	154520	There was something about today.
154520	158520	Even though the shit didn't really go down today, the shit went down last week.
158520	162520	Specifically while we were on stage for one of the shows, you know, the horrible events happened.
162520	164520	But it's just the wake of it all.
164520	165520	I think it hit a tipping point today.
165520	172520	It's just like you couldn't watch anything or take in any information without just feeling fucking apocalyptic about everything.
172520	180520	It just seems like I, you know, I stood here and promised everybody that Trump was a joke and that, you know, because the Irish were worried about it when Aaron was over there.
180520	182520	And I was like, that guy's not going to wear it.
182520	184520	But it's like, this guy's fucking antichrist.
184520	194520	I don't think you should keep tweeting this stuff if you discover, oh, 20 years ago, Trump was racist and all this stuff.
194520	202520	But it's like the sad thing about it is it's like, well, what are we waiting for the thing where all these idiots are going to go, you know what?
202520	203520	You're right.
203520	205520	He seems like a bad guy.
205520	224520	Like he's appealing to the most racist, like fearful, horrible, like part of I'm not going to say the most horrible people because the thing, the way to fight this is to believe that even the ignorant have a little Buddha inside of them that we can like tickle under the chin and bring them out.
224520	230520	Give him a shot of wheatgrass and a pat on the back and just say, look, man, we're scared, too.
230520	236520	We don't want the country to be broke, but don't fucking surround a mosque holding a gun wearing a ski mask.
236520	237520	That's not a protest.
237520	239520	What are you protesting?
239520	240520	This is insane.
240520	242520	The thing is just getting insane.
242520	244520	The airlines kicked these guys off.
244520	246520	I think that happened at two different airlines.
246520	251520	And the press is kind of fucking playing ball with it because they're not just calling it racism now.
251520	254520	They're calling it religious intolerance and anti-Muslim.
254520	256520	It's like the people didn't know they were Muslim.
256520	257520	They based it on something else.
257520	265520	I'm sure if you were an atheist Arab and someone didn't want to get on a plane with you, they're not like detecting your religion.
265520	269520	They're not fucking academics.
269520	273520	I'm complaining to a very sad choir.
273520	274520	I mean, whatever.
274520	275520	But I wanted to acknowledge.
275520	277520	I feel like the mood was just because it was kind of hot today.
277520	280520	Oh, OK.
280520	281520	Have you guys not been watching the news?
281520	283520	I'm sorry.
283520	284520	It was just wait a week.
284520	289520	It was just it was just really warm for for mid late November.
289520	291520	I put me in a bad mood.
291520	293520	Also, I've just stopped watching the news now.
293520	295520	I mean, I'll get it through bits and pieces.
295520	300520	But like when we got to New York, I got these texts from my brother and some friends saying, did you hear about what happened?
300520	301520	And like, are your friends OK out there?
301520	304520	And I was like, we have to walk on stage right now.
304520	308520	So I just put my head in the dirt like it's which is a terrible thing to have to do.
308520	311520	But we better than trying to come up with bits about it.
311520	317520	We got up to the show and there was there were 17 NYPD out in front of the theater.
317520	320520	And I didn't notice that.
320520	322520	But you told me about that or someone else told us there was literally 12.
322520	324520	I mean, we had the nut because we were like, how many are they here?
324520	325520	There's 12.
325520	329520	It's like, can you imagine there were 12 cops basically every single place in New York?
329520	332520	I have to imagine there was like volunteer wasn't the answer.
332520	334520	We said, like, like, we're like, are we.
334520	336520	Well, yeah, because we panicked a little bit.
336520	337520	We sat down on the green room.
337520	338520	I think it might have been ads.
338520	340520	It was because we're just like, wow, can you imagine this is so sad?
340520	342520	Because everybody, you know, the cops are sad.
342520	347520	Like nobody really believes in that moment that there's a threat.
347520	349520	But you know, it's that that like, like there's no.
349520	353520	But but at the same time, everyone understands that this has to be done now.
353520	354520	And that's what makes everyone sad.
354520	359520	It's just like, oh, our lives have been eclipsed by tragedy and there's nothing we can do.
359520	361520	And even the cops feel that way and the kids feel that way.
361520	364520	And everyone's just like, OK, wave the baton.
364520	367520	You go in and it was just very morose sad vibe.
367520	371520	The strange way is also kind of uplifting because obviously, like all of those police there,
371520	372520	they have to come from somewhere.
372520	379520	So if not, if not, like there must have been volunteers like putting on NYPD black jackets.
379520	384520	I don't know if that's legal or I don't think that's I don't know how many fucking NYPD cops
384520	388520	could possibly pull out of the reason why they put so many cops in a place is that because there's
388520	389520	more than 500 people in this building.
389520	391520	And that's that's the New York.
391520	392520	There's eight million people.
392520	396520	There's 700 people in most of the hotels.
396520	398520	It was the counterterrorism.
398520	399520	It was the.
399520	400520	So.
400520	401520	OK, so.
401520	404520	So we were sitting in the green room and we're like, I was just operating on the assumption of like,
404520	405520	oh, yeah, where are these cops coming from?
405520	406520	And I think it was ad set.
406520	411520	I think it's ad set when like, do you think maybe it's because they have specific reason to think
411520	412520	there's a threat here?
412520	413520	And I'm like, what?
413520	414520	Oh, fuck.
414520	419520	I was like, we just want to feel bad about international tragedy.
419520	422520	We don't want to start being narcissistically panicked about it.
422520	424520	But I couldn't get that out of my mind.
424520	426520	And then some things happened.
426520	429520	A young lady went out and asked the cops like specifically.
429520	431520	She's like, can you please tell us if there's something?
431520	433520	And they were like, no, no, no, no.
433520	435520	It's every place with over 300 people.
435520	440520	No, I almost called the counterterrorism unit when you took your pants off at the end of the second.
440520	441520	I think they almost came up there.
441520	449520	I believe in that moment I was as close as I have ever gotten to being a terrorist.
449520	453520	I certainly was not celebrating freedom or I was I wasn't rewarding it.
454520	457520	Um, yeah, I don't know.
457520	458520	Jet blue.
458520	459520	Okay.
462520	463520	That's been our show.
463520	464520	Good night, everybody.
464520	465520	I don't know.
465520	467520	What was the picture you posted of the venue?
467520	468520	Was that a jet blue?
468520	469520	Yeah, I don't.
469520	470520	I don't understand that.
470520	471520	Is it look on my Instagram?
471520	473520	There's nothing to talk about because I don't fucking understand it.
473520	475520	It's like these menu items and there's like these little tiny icons.
475520	477520	And one looks like a little horse.
477520	479520	And one looks like a little either a smaller horse or a dog.
479520	481520	It was like each menu item.
481520	483520	It's like the where you would put like a heart if it was low cholesterol or
483520	484520	something like that.
484520	486520	It's like, Oh, this one has horse plus dog.
486520	488520	There was a, there was a, there was a big horse.
488520	489520	I looked closely at it.
489520	494520	It's the same horse is just smaller, but it was big horse plus smaller horse
494520	495520	facing big horse.
495520	496520	Right.
496520	497520	Yeah.
497520	502520	Horse plus small horse equals like this little, this little one and a half horses.
502520	503520	Right.
503520	508520	But my, my, my guess on that is it's there's full or half size portions available.
509520	511520	I can, I can, I can eat a horse.
511520	514520	Or I'm a, I'm a, I'm a horse.
514520	515520	So hungry.
515520	518520	I could have the full pasta or I'm a horse.
518520	519520	So small.
519520	521520	I can only have the half pasta.
523520	524520	All right.
524520	525520	Well, you know what?
525520	528520	There's nothing, there's nothing on this list that I can't talk about with our
528520	531520	guest tonight who has a heart out and I don't want to cheat them.
531520	534520	So why don't we, why don't we just bring them up and start chatting.
534520	539520	He's a fantastic, really, really intimidatingly funny guy that I, I first
539520	544520	got to taste of his, his, his in-person talents.
544520	545520	What am I talking about?
546520	548520	What am I, what language am I speaking?
549520	550520	Telling me love him.
551520	552520	I do love him.
552520	553520	I was on a podcast with him.
555520	560520	And, and then, and then he did Harmon Quest for an episode and he's just a,
560520	563520	he's just a wonderful, wonderful, nerdy, really funny dude.
563520	567520	And, and, and, and he had to come here sooner or later.
567520	568520	So he's here tonight.
568520	569520	Let's bring Thomas Middleditch up.
569520	570520	Oh yeah.
581520	582520	Hello.
584520	586520	Thank you for coming.
589520	591520	Do you want anything to drink?
591520	592520	Oh no, I'm fine.
592520	593520	I got my, my wah-wah.
593520	595520	Do you have an early, early day tomorrow?
595520	596520	Yes, yes.
596520	600520	Shooting that old TV show, that old rag, Silicon Valley.
604520	607520	They don't tell you, they don't tell you in the biz that you got to start getting
607520	609520	up at like 5.30 in the morning earlier sometimes.
609520	611520	Are you guys shooting at a studio?
611520	612520	Are you on location?
612520	614520	Sony Pictures, Motion Picture Studio lot.
615520	616520	Culver City.
616520	617520	Culver City.
617520	618520	Do you live on the west side, east side?
618520	619520	I live in Hollywood.
619520	621520	So that's, that's a hell of a drive.
621520	622520	That's a nice 45 minute.
622520	624520	Yeah, at 5.30 it's going to be a breeze.
624520	625520	Yeah.
625520	627520	There's one bar over there.
627520	628520	Are you?
629520	630520	That's right Dan.
630520	631520	Story checks out.
633520	635520	JetBlue can't stand them.
635520	636520	I'm sitting there, you're bringing it up.
636520	638520	I'm like, oh, I hate them.
638520	639520	Oh yeah.
639520	640520	Let's hear your JetBlue.
640520	641520	It's chunk.
641520	642520	It's pretty petty and stupid.
642520	645520	Well, I mean, are you a first class only?
645520	646520	No, no.
646520	649520	I actually am a big fan of coach and.
650520	652520	Well, then you must feel that JetBlue has now sold out
652520	654520	because they have a premium class now.
654520	655520	Oh, well, yeah, I don't.
655520	658520	That I don't know or care about.
658520	663520	Welcome to Mile High Kveching, where we talk about,
663520	665520	I don't know, what were you going to say?
665520	668520	Oh, I was just going to say, well, last time I flew them,
668520	671520	they were doing, if you want to order something,
671520	673520	I don't know about the horses, but they'd have,
673520	677520	you could either get free snacks like a bag of peanuts
677520	680520	or whatever, and then you could pay money for like
680520	683520	essentially snack packs, which are just packages
683520	685520	of smaller packages of snacks.
685520	686520	Those boxes, yeah.
686520	687520	There's no sandwiches.
687520	688520	There's no nothing.
688520	689520	So forget it.
689520	691520	Forget sandwiches on JetBlue.
691520	694520	You're only getting packages of smaller packages of snacks.
694520	696520	Well, because they convert, I mean,
696520	698520	I don't know if that was always the case.
698520	700520	JetBlue.
700520	701520	Damn.
701520	704520	Thomas, is your hatred of JetBlue a snack based hatred?
704520	706520	It's purely a snack based hatred.
707520	710520	You can't, we're in a world where packaging is,
710520	712520	we're getting mounds of packaging in this world,
712520	714520	and I can't get a sandwich now because I got to get
714520	718520	packages of smaller packages of snacks.
718520	720520	Not going to do it.
722520	724520	And it is infuriating when you read,
724520	726520	so when you read stories like that in Southwest Airlines
726520	729520	that there was a little revolt because there were two
729520	733520	Arab gentlemen who run a pizza restaurant in Chicago
733520	736520	together or something, and they were holding a box
736520	738520	because he had baklava in it.
738520	740520	Because that's how terrorists operate.
740520	743520	They get all gussied up in their best Muslim gear
743520	746520	and then they put a bomb in a box and they just
746520	748520	walk up to the plane and they go,
748520	750520	can I please get on the plane?
750520	752520	And they go, yeah, sure, that's just pizza, right?
752520	754520	Come on in.
754520	756520	And so somebody went up and said,
756520	759520	I'm not flying with him, and then this entire airline,
759520	762520	you know, these people who are always high-roading you,
762520	765520	if you've had one too many,
768520	772520	and as Dino once did, you simply mistake the cockpit door
772520	776520	for the bathroom and it's locked, so you're banging on it.
776520	780520	That actually happened to Dino for real.
780520	782520	He was so drunk that, I wasn't there,
782520	784520	but he tells us he was so drunk, he was like,
784520	786520	who the fuck's in the bathroom?
786520	788520	It's been forever, and he's like banging on that.
788520	790520	Very dangerous, a very dangerous thing.
790520	792520	That could move.
792520	794520	But it is something extra outrageous about that
794520	796520	because you're always living under the tyranny
796520	801520	of these unremarkable, these threshold guardians
801520	803520	who are like, it used to be there in the hospitality
803520	805520	business, and then after 9-11 they became these
805520	811520	fucking undeputized air marshals, you know?
811520	815520	They were like, oh good, no more fucking Mr. Nice Guy
815520	818520	and by the way, never was nice.
818520	821520	And now it's just the tone and all that shit,
821520	822520	and you're always in a bad mood,
822520	824520	and you're always hyper aware of the class system
824520	826520	because they literally are like,
826520	828520	there's no one good way to do it,
828520	830520	so you're always in a bad mood and they're in a bad mood
830520	831520	and it's just the worst situation,
831520	833520	and then when you read stories like that,
833520	836520	you're going, oh, so also if the shit does ever hit the fan,
836520	839520	you're a fucking traitor to everybody.
839520	841520	You're just a dummy.
841520	842520	What kind of bullshit is that?
842520	844520	If a guy comes up and says,
844520	852520	how many years have we had to, that's insane.
852520	854520	Somebody would come up and go,
854520	856520	I want to fly with that guy,
856520	857520	and it's like, oh, I know how to handle this.
857520	859520	I don't even have to read the manual.
859520	862520	Hey, sir, you're out.
862520	864520	He doesn't want to fly with you.
864520	867520	I'm taking his side.
867520	872520	At one point they made the guy show his baklava to everybody,
872520	873520	and he shared it with them.
873520	875520	Well, he should have brought it up to everybody.
875520	877520	I love baklava.
877520	879520	And all the people shared the baklava with him,
879520	883520	and they were like, we're so sorry, but racism.
883520	884520	He just got rewarded for it.
884520	886520	I get it, I get it.
886520	888520	I mean, that's how my dog works
888520	891520	and how much smarter than my dog are people that,
891520	894520	15 years after 9-11, haven't figured out that fucking,
894520	896520	God damn it, don't get me started.
896520	897520	Listen to all the other podcasts
897520	899520	if you want to hear about this shit, right?
899520	902520	You come here for automotive tips.
902520	907520	So I understand you got a new Impala you're wrenching on.
907520	910520	Chevy Volt all day, baby.
910520	914520	Dan, on the topic of cars, real quick, Thomas,
914520	917520	we frequently gripe about Uber and Lyft on the show.
917520	918520	Okay, why?
918520	923520	Just because funny hypocrisies and things have happened in the car.
923520	925520	I prefer Lyft to Uber.
925520	929520	Dan hates Uber, but will never go to Lyft.
929520	933520	My driver today had a brand new 2015 Mini Cooper.
933520	935520	Don't care for it.
935520	936520	You don't care for it.
936520	937520	Coopers?
937520	938520	Yeah.
938520	940520	The display is like this giant circle
940520	943520	of like crazy digital readouts and all this stuff.
943520	945520	And I go, oh, is this the new one?
945520	947520	My brother has like I think like 2012.
947520	948520	Is this the new one?
948520	949520	He goes, yeah.
949520	950520	I go, do you like it?
950520	951520	He goes, yeah, I like it.
951520	952520	I like it.
952520	954520	I go, but you don't love it?
954520	956520	He goes, I mean, no, I like it.
956520	957520	I go, why don't you like it?
957520	968520	But he goes, it's kind of small.
968520	969520	The Mini.
969520	970520	Well, it's not just the Mini.
970520	972520	I knew it was a Mini, obviously, from the name.
972520	975520	But then when you get in it, you feel kind of like actively,
975520	978520	like it's pinning you in.
978520	980520	Like it's doing it to you.
980520	986520	Like it's putting you in a container for chickens.
987520	989520	You mean it's it's it's cooping you.
989520	991520	Let's go.
991520	996520	So so so even if it was a mega Cooper,
996520	1002520	you should expect some constriction.
1002520	1007520	The floor was sprinkled with seed.
1007520	1009520	My feet are glued to the floor with my own feces
1009520	1013520	and some guy from Tyson Foods keeps clubbing me in the head.
1016520	1017520	We got it.
1017520	1019520	We got to stop eating meat.
1019520	1020520	It's true.
1020520	1021520	It's so delicious.
1021520	1022520	It's true.
1022520	1024520	It's so bad.
1024520	1026520	Are you verging on the vegetarianism all of a sudden?
1026520	1027520	You got to come.
1027520	1028520	You're going to come over here.
1028520	1029520	Are you?
1029520	1030520	I just did a lot.
1030520	1032520	I switched over about well, you're in some change now.
1032520	1034520	You on this documentary, Cowspiracy.
1034520	1035520	Oh, fuck.
1035520	1038520	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1038520	1039520	Now look, now look.
1039520	1041520	Occasionally, occasionally I'll cheat.
1041520	1044520	So one day you'd be like, you're in a fucking sushi, man.
1044520	1045520	You just told me you don't eat meat.
1045520	1046520	No, just chill, OK?
1046520	1049520	Chill the fuck out.
1049520	1051520	It's like 90% of the time I don't.
1051520	1053520	But yeah, you got to get out of there, man.
1053520	1056520	Is Kumail veggie?
1056520	1057520	No, no, no.
1057520	1058520	Oh, Zach Woods is.
1058520	1060520	Because he looks like a fucking action figure now.
1060520	1063520	But Aziz and Shrob.
1063520	1064520	Sure.
1064520	1069520	And then so there's, what are you miming, Dan?
1069520	1072520	Well, I just started drinking these Soylent things.
1072520	1074520	You know what Soylent is?
1074520	1076520	Like Soylent Green, like human meat?
1076520	1077520	No.
1077520	1080520	Unfortunately, they didn't know about that reference when they...
1080520	1082520	I always thought it was ironic.
1082520	1086520	They named it after the 1958 sci-fi book
1086520	1088520	from which that comes.
1088520	1091520	But the movie Soylent Green, I think,
1091520	1093520	which was also based on that book,
1093520	1096520	added a few things, including the cannibalism.
1096520	1097520	Yeah.
1097520	1099520	That's sweet, sweet human meat.
1099520	1101520	And so the people that named it Soylent
1101520	1102520	were just going like,
1102520	1104520	doff of the cap to a futuristic drink
1104520	1106520	without ever having seen the 1975 movie
1106520	1108520	where the whole point is like,
1108520	1112520	the futuristic drink is human flesh.
1112520	1113520	But I just stick it for like,
1113520	1114520	ah, it's millennial marketing.
1114520	1115520	You know, like you walk past a place
1115520	1117520	and it says like Acne Studios,
1117520	1118520	and you're like, that's the worst name for it.
1118520	1121520	I got it, you little brat.
1121520	1123520	You're keeping the old man out.
1123520	1126520	You don't want my paradigms on your paradigms.
1126520	1128520	They're like, sorry, kids only, old man.
1128520	1129520	Yeah.
1129520	1130520	Beat it.
1130520	1133520	Thomas, what made you cross over?
1133520	1136520	Oh, it's always annoying to hear about.
1136520	1138520	I've been vegetarian for 23 years,
1138520	1139520	so you won't mind me.
1139520	1140520	Oh, okay.
1140520	1141520	I'm so vegetarian,
1141520	1142520	I don't even know what cow-spiracy is
1142520	1143520	because I'm fucking already there.
1143520	1144520	You're already there.
1144520	1145520	I wish I was.
1145520	1146520	I wish I had been.
1146520	1147520	I got one of those.
1147520	1148520	I got one of those fucking lip-sits.
1148520	1149520	Go ahead.
1149520	1150520	You got a lip-sit?
1150520	1151520	Bob.
1151520	1152520	That would be so annoying.
1152520	1153520	Yeah, I have a story.
1153520	1154520	I was trying to tell you after this.
1154520	1155520	Why do I have to say that?
1155520	1156520	Go ahead.
1156520	1157520	Speak.
1157520	1158520	I'm sorry.
1158520	1159520	I'm terribly on the question.
1159520	1160520	What do I do?
1160520	1162520	Dan, how do Thomas and I focus on our vegetarian story
1162520	1163520	when you have a lip-sit going on?
1163520	1164520	No, just go ahead.
1164520	1165520	I'm sorry.
1165520	1167520	I'm a narcissist, and I'm a bad person,
1167520	1168520	and just go.
1168520	1169520	Lip-sit sounds like an 80s song.
1169520	1170520	Like, lip-sit.
1173520	1176520	The lip-sit, it's a painful sore
1176520	1179520	that you have upon your mouth.
1180520	1181520	All right.
1181520	1183520	Pop-sentites are just ingrown here.
1183520	1185520	Tell him your veggie origin story.
1185520	1187520	Well, I mean...
1187520	1189520	Well, Dan sucks behind you.
1189520	1190520	Look, you know, I sit here.
1190520	1193520	I call myself an environmentalist.
1193520	1194520	I drive my Chevy Volt.
1194520	1196520	I donate to Sierra Club and Defenders of Wildlife
1196520	1197520	on all this kind of stuff.
1197520	1199520	I'm like, here I am trying to save the planet,
1199520	1201520	and then I didn't even realize literally
1201520	1205520	the worst thing for the planet is animal husbandry.
1205520	1206520	I didn't know that.
1206520	1208520	You know, people say, hey, cow farts.
1208520	1210520	They're pretty bad for the atmosphere.
1210520	1211520	They're the worst thing for the atmosphere.
1211520	1212520	Who knew?
1212520	1213520	Methane.
1213520	1214520	Really bad stuff.
1214520	1216520	Guys, it's exciting podcast material.
1218520	1220520	But, I mean, you know, and not to mention
1220520	1221520	the sewage runoff.
1221520	1222520	Cows are like literally the worst thing.
1222520	1223520	Deforestation.
1223520	1225520	I like cougars and wolves and berries.
1225520	1229520	They clear rainforests to make room for the farting cows.
1229520	1231520	Rainforests?
1231520	1235520	It's one to two acres a second of rainforest
1235520	1236520	throughout space and time.
1236520	1238520	One second, one to two acres.
1238520	1240520	And something like 93 percent of the reason
1240520	1242520	is animal husbandry or feed crops
1242520	1244520	for the animal husbandry.
1244520	1245520	Fucking man, everybody's like,
1245520	1247520	all these fucking meat guys are like,
1247520	1248520	what about almond milk, man?
1248520	1250520	You fucking asshole, almond milk.
1250520	1253520	You know what the worst fucking drought crop is?
1253520	1254520	Alfalfa.
1254520	1256520	What do we use alfalfa for?
1256520	1257520	To feed cows.
1257520	1259520	What does California alfalfa go to?
1259520	1261520	China to feed their cows.
1261520	1262520	God damn it.
1265520	1267520	And then I tell you what, man.
1267520	1269520	Can't you hear the song?
1269520	1271520	It's the sound of angry man.
1271520	1272520	I stopped this meat shit.
1272520	1274520	I was like, fucking, I'm out.
1275520	1276520	I'm out of this meat game.
1276520	1277520	I'm out of this meat game.
1277520	1279520	I don't want to be a part of it anymore.
1279520	1280520	And then it hit me.
1280520	1281520	And then it hit me.
1281520	1282520	This is a couple weeks later,
1282520	1284520	I was sitting in some hotel room.
1284520	1285520	I was like, oh, my God.
1285520	1288520	And I quit for the environmentalist reason.
1288520	1291520	But then the death and the sadness hit me.
1291520	1293520	It's such a horrible industry.
1293520	1294520	They torture these creatures.
1294520	1296520	And even if it's in a whole foods farm
1296520	1298520	with pastures and stuff, it's like,
1298520	1300520	here, Betsy, live this fucking rad life.
1300520	1302520	Thank you for your time.
1302520	1303520	Bam.
1303520	1304520	Nice.
1304520	1305520	Ah.
1305520	1306520	And it's like, I don't ever hunt anything.
1306520	1307520	I don't even want to kill a chicken.
1307520	1309520	What am I doing to these animals?
1309520	1311520	I want them to live.
1311520	1313520	Dogs are beautiful, right?
1313520	1314520	We all like dogs.
1314520	1315520	Pigs are the same as dogs.
1315520	1316520	Why are we cutting the pigs up?
1316520	1318520	Why are we forcing them into these little cages
1318520	1320520	where they literally cut off the pig's tail
1320520	1322520	in front of them so it's so painful
1322520	1324520	when the pig behind them gnashes on their tail
1324520	1327520	that it has to kick the pig behind it.
1327520	1330520	Otherwise, it's too sad to do anything about it.
1330520	1332520	And then you get infected tail meat.
1332520	1338520	And then it's a loss in terms of money.
1338520	1340520	It's not worth it, you guys.
1340520	1345520	It's not worth it.
1345520	1346520	It tastes great.
1346520	1347520	It's not worth it, though.
1347520	1349520	So Dan, you have a little zit in your lip?
1349520	1352520	Yeah.
1352520	1353520	That's what you're talking about.
1353520	1355520	It's right on the line, you know?
1355520	1356520	But that's one of those.
1356520	1357520	That's what you're talking about,
1357520	1358520	you know, the sadness in the air.
1358520	1360520	I feel that sometimes so crushingly
1361520	1362520	is like you take a look at the word
1362520	1364520	and you go, what are we doing here?
1364520	1366520	We're spinning around and we're melting each other.
1366520	1368520	Yeah, because it hurts, but then you...
1368520	1369520	If you try to pop it.
1369520	1371520	Tweezers, it probably is an ingrown here.
1371520	1374520	Yeah, so I was at Spring Street Lounge in New York
1374520	1379520	and I was hanging out with some Venezuelans.
1379520	1383520	And that's not their identity, but they were from there.
1383520	1389520	One of them was a coder who also does not like Mr. Robot.
1390520	1391520	I like Mr. Robot.
1391520	1394520	Tough titties.
1394520	1399520	I just watch Fight Club again.
1399520	1401520	We got a hack into the world.
1401520	1402520	I do.
1402520	1403520	I love that actor.
1403520	1404520	Not so bad.
1404520	1405520	I love the performances.
1405520	1407520	There's a lot of great things about the show.
1407520	1409520	I'm just a shitty fucking petty competitive writer.
1409520	1411520	When young writers get attention,
1411520	1413520	there's some fucking flare up in me
1413520	1414520	that I still haven't overcome.
1414520	1416520	I'm going to talk to my shrink about it.
1416520	1417520	I get it.
1417520	1418520	I do get it.
1418520	1422520	It's Good Will Hunting 30 years later.
1422520	1424520	Do you have a competition with Good Will Hunting?
1424520	1425520	Yeah.
1425520	1426520	I'm still mad about that.
1426520	1428520	How do you like them apples thing?
1428520	1430520	How is that guy supposed to respond?
1430520	1431520	Why would he ever say yes?
1431520	1433520	Well, who says yes when you say,
1433520	1434520	how do you like them apples?
1434520	1435520	Thomas, I don't know.
1435520	1436520	And if that guy hadn't said yes...
1436520	1437520	Do you know the line he's talking about?
1437520	1438520	Yeah.
1438520	1439520	When he gets the number?
1439520	1440520	Yeah.
1440520	1441520	The guy says yes to it?
1441520	1442520	Yeah.
1442520	1444520	And if he hadn't, no movie.
1444520	1446520	I don't remember the yes.
1447520	1448520	Because that guy ends up...
1448520	1449520	No.
1449520	1450520	Just come on.
1450520	1451520	Let's move on.
1451520	1452520	But I was...
1452520	1453520	How good is it?
1453520	1454520	I was in this bar.
1454520	1456520	And I'm making friends with these gentlemen.
1456520	1458520	They're very funny and interesting.
1458520	1460520	One's a coder.
1460520	1462520	He was from Venezuela.
1462520	1463520	But he was Jewish.
1463520	1464520	His name was Abraham.
1464520	1465520	Maybe I'm saying too much information.
1465520	1469520	Maybe now he's going to get doxxed.
1469520	1470520	But he's a coder.
1470520	1472520	He'll be able to repel the attack.
1472520	1475520	But the only way he'll know that is with a fucking voiceover.
1475520	1483520	The other guy was like an accountant.
1483520	1485520	I was just getting to know them and talking about it.
1485520	1487520	And we were having such a good time.
1487520	1493520	And then the accountant guy started wanting to talk about the politics.
1493520	1496520	He was like, the thing about the refugees and the Trump and all this stuff.
1496520	1498520	And I was like, yeah, yeah.
1498520	1500520	Let's not do it.
1500520	1501520	You know?
1501520	1502520	I've gotten to that age.
1502520	1503520	I was like, let's not talk about politics.
1503520	1504520	I was like, yeah.
1504520	1505520	We should be talking about it.
1505520	1508520	And then he's telling me about all the refugees.
1508520	1509520	What age they should be.
1509520	1511520	Or they should be sent back and all this stuff.
1511520	1512520	I'm like, come on, man.
1512520	1513520	You're Venezuelan.
1513520	1515520	What am I supposed to say to this?
1515520	1520520	I'm supposed to white-splain to you?
1520520	1523520	I'm not saying he wasn't second generation.
1523520	1526520	He was a guy that came here.
1526520	1530520	And he's like, now he's in this mode.
1530520	1534520	And then this Irish guy comes up with this Irish-American guy.
1534520	1537520	And he was twirling like a baton.
1537520	1538520	What's all this about, then?
1538520	1539520	Well, well, well.
1539520	1542520	I think the two of you should be in school right about now.
1542520	1543520	No, no.
1543520	1548520	We're supposed to get barrels to wear for a fishing trip.
1548520	1551520	We chase so much steals our clothes.
1551520	1552520	Listen in the barrel.
1552520	1556520	It's like, oh, it's an old timey day, is it?
1556520	1558520	No, he was like Colin Quinn Irish.
1559520	1562520	He sounded and kind of looked exactly like Colin Quinn.
1562520	1564520	So he pictured that archetype.
1564520	1567520	His voice sounded like, I said, you sound like fucking Colin Quinn.
1567520	1569520	He's like, hey, what about the Irish?
1569520	1574520	He just heard inflammatory language and was attracted to it
1574520	1577520	like a bee at a picnic when the soda comes open.
1577520	1580520	He was just like, hey, what about the Irish?
1580520	1582520	But it wasn't like we were going down this stuff.
1582520	1585520	The ethnic group was bad.
1585520	1588520	He just wasn't responding to anything.
1588520	1589520	He was just starting it.
1589520	1592520	And then I was like, I had nothing about the Irish.
1592520	1594520	And it was like those guys were riling each other up.
1594520	1597520	But they liked each other because they were both like these hardliners.
1597520	1600520	And then the Irish guy turned out to be a vet.
1600520	1601520	So now you're fucked.
1601520	1602520	Veterinarian or vet?
1602520	1604520	No.
1604520	1608520	The kind you can never disagree with about anything.
1608520	1612520	Like you can tell a veterinarian that cats shouldn't be put to sleep.
1612520	1614520	But you can't fucking talk.
1614520	1617520	You can call a text with a guy who is in the shit.
1617520	1619520	He gets to be right about everything.
1619520	1621520	That's why I don't want to talk about politics in a bar.
1621520	1624520	Because somebody will come over with like one leg and go like, fuck you.
1624520	1625520	I'm right about everything.
1625520	1626520	And you're like, you are.
1626520	1627520	You're right.
1627520	1629520	But you're also saying weird shit, you know.
1629520	1631520	But so that guy.
1631520	1634520	So anyways, I just want to say all these guys were nice guys.
1634520	1636520	This isn't a story about how I was going to nightmare it.
1636520	1637520	This is the point of my story.
1637520	1641520	Has this ever, I mean, this is like, I don't know if this is a New York thing
1641520	1644520	or what, but this was the weirdest thing.
1644520	1648520	Because the guy was like, you know, he had that machismo, that Colin Quinn machismo.
1648520	1651520	And you guys are like, Colin Quinn's 90.
1651520	1655520	Well, when I was your age, Colin Quinn had machismo.
1655520	1659520	Now Colin Quinn's like, I'm going to write him a letter.
1659520	1664520	Dear fucko, me and Jim Norton are going to come over
1664520	1670520	and say very funny things that are going to make you feel bad.
1670520	1674520	Dear Colin Quinn, now you sound like Christopher Lloyd.
1674520	1677520	Dear fucko, I don't care who I sound like.
1677520	1681520	I'm a vet.
1681520	1683520	So we're just talking and hanging.
1683520	1689520	And the Irish American, Iraq War veteran,
1689520	1692520	he starts squinting at me while I'm talking.
1692520	1694520	And he goes like, what is this?
1694520	1695520	What is this?
1695520	1697520	You get some kind of, and he had some phrase,
1697520	1700520	he had some kind of nickname for something that I've never heard.
1700520	1703520	He goes, I've got a hooch-a-cooch-a, or something like that.
1703520	1705520	He said, bligadoo-ba-doo, or something.
1705520	1707520	I said some word that was gibberish to me,
1707520	1709520	and he's pointing at the back of my neck,
1709520	1712520	and I'm like, what do I have in the back of my neck?
1712520	1715520	And he's like, because I thought, well, if there's much on my neck,
1715520	1718520	I'm going to get it off, I guess, because he's already reaching for it.
1718520	1720520	I said, what, do I have a spider on my neck?
1720520	1726520	And he fucking grabs it and he pops a zit for me.
1727520	1728520	And I was like, oh!
1728520	1730520	And then he wipes it with his finger.
1730520	1732520	He was like, oh!
1732520	1734520	Well, I don't mean, like, smears it on me.
1734520	1736520	I mean, like, respectfully.
1736520	1738520	Like, he was, like, grooming me.
1738520	1740520	He wasn't bullying me.
1740520	1742520	He was, like, grooming me.
1742520	1745520	So you had a poppable visible zit.
1745520	1746520	And he fucking reached out.
1746520	1747520	I'll take care of that.
1747520	1750520	Yeah, and he took care of it like I was his kid or something.
1750520	1753520	You were, like, for a second like a foxhole brother.
1753520	1754520	Yeah, yeah.
1754520	1755520	Yeah.
1756520	1760520	And I say, it was just one of those moments where, because it was like, ow!
1760520	1763520	And then it was like, but it was so clearly not at all like,
1763520	1769520	it was the opposite of what you'd be afraid of in an encounter with that guy,
1769520	1772520	because that guy reminds you of just opposition and all this stuff.
1772520	1776520	And the guy was just, like, belligerent and jingoistic and narcissistic
1776520	1780520	and bragging about his combat and, like, wanting to talk about all the different races
1780520	1781520	and all this stuff.
1781520	1785520	And it was, like, all of that you associate with, like, you know,
1785520	1788520	this is all bad, but really it all boils down to this is all usually bad,
1788520	1791520	because usually it's a symptom of a guy, like, doing bad things, you know?
1791520	1798520	Like, he's going to end up, like, picking a fight or hogging the jukebox or something,
1798520	1799520	you know?
1799520	1801520	He's going to end up, and it's going to turn out he was a bass player.
1801520	1803520	I'm going to listen to his shitty album all night.
1803520	1809520	Like, all right, it's not just because he's a bass player that the album's shitty.
1809520	1810520	It's a necessary instrument.
1810520	1811520	I'm just saying.
1811520	1813520	You know what I'm talking about.
1813520	1815520	Not to offend any of the bass players.
1815520	1818520	Of which this entire audience is comprised.
1818520	1820520	You've been with that guy.
1820520	1822520	Dino was the guy over at his house.
1822520	1827520	And the guy said, he pulled out his, like, iPod, and he said,
1827520	1830520	hey, do you like...
1830520	1832520	He's like, hey, let me play some stuff.
1832520	1833520	Do you mind if I do a little DJing?
1833520	1834520	Okay.
1834520	1836520	He's like, hey, do you like Led Zeppelin?
1836520	1838520	And Dino's like, yeah.
1838520	1840520	And he's like, yeah, so does my band.
1840520	1842520	Derp.
1842520	1844520	And played the whole...
1844520	1845520	There's nothing more.
1845520	1848520	I can't say when someone plays their music and then just, like,
1848520	1850520	watches you listening to it.
1850520	1852520	Yeah.
1852520	1857520	And I just want to turn to them and go, I don't think Radiohead ever did this.
1857520	1858520	I can't imagine.
1858520	1864520	I think they fucking sucked it up and waited for people to come to see them.
1864520	1868520	I have so many questions about the veteran Zit popper guy.
1868520	1870520	Because I know you...
1870520	1872520	You're not a physical contact fan.
1872520	1873520	No, no, yeah.
1873520	1874520	That's the thing.
1874520	1876520	It was so paternal.
1876520	1879520	Also, you've talked about the fact that you wouldn't get a massage.
1879520	1880520	No, this is what...
1880520	1881520	It's on paper.
1881520	1882520	It's my worst nightmare.
1882520	1884520	Because it's a big jock.
1884520	1888520	It's what jocks become, which is in their highest form archetypically,
1888520	1892520	which is a soldier, which is a guy who's trained to kill.
1892520	1897520	It's also combined with, like, he's a right-wing person
1897520	1901520	who wants to talk about, you know, how the things that are physical
1901520	1905520	about people are markers of differences that are unsolvable
1905520	1907520	because Italians do this, but the Irish do that.
1907520	1910520	It's like everything is like a nightmare about it.
1910520	1914520	But then he did that one little thing and it was like, oh, dad.
1914520	1917520	And then he just says, you're going to be all right, boyo.
1917520	1918520	You're going to be all right.
1919520	1923520	But your initial physical reaction was not like...
1923520	1924520	Well, it was shock.
1924520	1925520	I didn't know what was happening.
1925520	1927520	And then by the time I realized what was happening,
1927520	1929520	he was, like, gingerly cleaned it, you know?
1929520	1932520	Like, he popped and then he, like, you know, he wasn't just like...
1932520	1934520	I think he was like, yeah, he was just like...
1935520	1937520	Someone's fainting in the back.
1939520	1941520	That's a really intimate thing to do with somebody.
1941520	1942520	Yeah, I know.
1942520	1945520	And also, like, in the days of, like, disease and stuff.
1945520	1946520	AIDS and stuff, yeah.
1946520	1947520	It's like, wow, wee.
1948520	1949520	This person's having an...
1950520	1952520	Is this one person that's just having the...
1952520	1955520	Tom is like, what you said was my first thought is like,
1955520	1958520	this is what you do when your brothers are in a foxhole next to them.
1958520	1960520	Like, when you're in the shit, like...
1960520	1963520	Probably you let the zits go, right?
1963520	1964520	I think not with this guy.
1964520	1966520	I think he probably had his...
1966520	1968520	You don't have the best skin in the whole army.
1968520	1971520	There are some people that like to pop zits.
1971520	1972520	I gotta be honest.
1972520	1973520	My mom is one of them.
1973520	1975520	She's like, she loved it when they were teens
1975520	1977520	because she'd be like, give me your back.
1978520	1980520	That's actually part of the reason I brought this story up
1980520	1982520	is because I knew, when he did it, I also knew...
1982520	1986520	It's part of what mitigated it is because I once dated a girl
1986520	1989520	who had that thing and I was like, it's so fucking weird
1989520	1990520	because she's like, can I please?
1990520	1992520	And I'm like, can you please?
1994520	1997520	Are you sure you're not just trying to impress me?
1997520	1998520	Not that it would?
2000520	2002520	No, I really like it.
2002520	2003520	Like, oh, don't...
2003520	2004520	Yeah, save them up.
2005520	2008520	Like, there are some people who fucking love it.
2008520	2010520	There's videos online of people with like...
2010520	2011520	They're called dermatologists.
2011520	2013520	You get a facial.
2013520	2015520	Their favorite thing is the extraction part.
2015520	2017520	I always ask them, you ever had a facial?
2017520	2019520	Oh, God, yes.
2019520	2021520	What, am I an animal?
2022520	2023520	My savage?
2023520	2026520	I can tell because your face fairly glows, Thomas.
2026520	2028520	I have night creams and day creams.
2030520	2031520	Fuck yeah, you do.
2032520	2033520	What's your...
2033520	2034520	What kind of...
2034520	2035520	You got a daily scrub you use?
2035520	2037520	Oh, no, I stay away from the scrubs.
2037520	2038520	It'll dry you out.
2039520	2041520	Dry you out quicker than a week in the desert.
2045520	2048520	There's one little epilogue to this story.
2048520	2049520	That's a good story.
2049520	2050520	That happens.
2050520	2051520	That's in the midst of this.
2051520	2053520	It's like, okay, so that was weird.
2053520	2056520	And I didn't necessarily start liking the guy.
2056520	2058520	It was just, I just found that kind of profound
2058520	2061520	that the unexpected things were happening
2061520	2064520	in an encounter that from the moment that guy came up
2064520	2066520	and said, what about the Irish?
2066520	2068520	I was like, this is the fucking worst.
2070520	2073520	But the story didn't end the way I thought it would.
2073520	2075520	I didn't want to hang out there anyway, though.
2075520	2077520	But the biggest reason I didn't want to hang out there
2077520	2082520	is because there were four guys sitting over at that end bar part
2082520	2085520	where we would be if we were all there.
2085520	2087520	By the Cab Calloway Jive dictionary thing?
2088520	2091520	They were regulars and they were older
2091520	2094520	and they seemed like literary types or something.
2094520	2097520	I remember the story about me being mistaken for a Mr. Grossman.
2098520	2100520	That was the same bar because I was wearing a jacket.
2100520	2103520	These guys all looked like Mr. Grossmans.
2104520	2109520	And they were like, they were glowering at all of us the whole time
2109520	2112520	because we were all talking loudly.
2112520	2116520	And I could hear them doing this running commentary the whole time.
2116520	2119520	And they were nerds and they were intellectuals
2119520	2121520	because the real reason I left the bar is because
2121520	2123520	I was getting angry and angry at them.
2123520	2125520	Because I wanted to turn to them and go,
2125520	2127520	why don't you guys fucking cheer up or go somewhere you can be happy?
2127520	2131520	Fucking talking to two guys on a fucking...
2131520	2134520	Yeah, he's a fucking Mama Luke.
2134520	2136520	But he's popping my zits.
2136520	2138520	What are you doing for me?
2138520	2140520	What have you done for me lately?
2140520	2142520	He fought for this fucking country, Jack.
2142520	2148520	But there was prejudice coming from the guys
2148520	2151520	who were probably the most liberal and intellectual
2151520	2155520	because they were like, oh, here's these types that are going to bring.
2155520	2161520	They were a shadow that I was casting before I got my zit popped.
2161520	2165520	I was terrified that certain kinds of people
2165520	2167520	are going to make your bar experience that right.
2167520	2170520	And they were sitting there the whole time just statlering and Waldorfing.
2172520	2174520	And so I boned out.
2174520	2178520	That's the end of my story about getting my zits.
2178520	2180520	America.
2180520	2184520	And as he walked home, the ghost of future Christmas was like,
2184520	2187520	you've learned a valuable lesson.
2187520	2193520	I want to know how many soldiers, Marines, Airmen, Zeman,
2193520	2197520	are out there doing their duty and just...
2197520	2200520	Buddy, you got a thing over there.
2201520	2203520	Well, actors, you can probably verify this
2203520	2206520	unless the community cast is really weird, but I assume not.
2206520	2210520	If you watch enough dailies, there's so much footage of,
2210520	2213520	because they're sitting there for 12 hours under hot lights,
2213520	2215520	they're at each other's mercy.
2215520	2219520	So they'll just like, oh, you got to...
2219520	2221520	Oh, can you just get it?
2221520	2223520	And they're just picking each other's noses and stuff?
2223520	2225520	No, stay out of here.
2225520	2228520	You don't want to get in there.
2228520	2231520	There's too much.
2231520	2233520	You always think you're going to go and get a little treat.
2233520	2236520	You come out with a full feast.
2236520	2238520	Too much.
2238520	2239520	And I hate it.
2239520	2241520	I hate it when people grab your nose,
2241520	2244520	when people pinch your nose because I'll have like a hard one in there
2244520	2246520	and it digs.
2246520	2249520	And then I got a nosebleed because you thought it was so funny to me.
2249520	2252520	When people pinch your nose, you got a sharp one in there.
2252520	2254520	You got an angular one.
2254520	2256520	Yeah, I go, no, no, don't pinch noses.
2256520	2258520	What are you doing?
2258520	2260520	What are you, an old granny?
2260520	2261520	What are you pinching nose for?
2261520	2262520	No, I agree with that.
2262520	2263520	Get out of my nose.
2263520	2264520	But that's not this.
2264520	2266520	This is actors protecting each other from the...
2266520	2269520	They're like clearing out each other's natural openings and stuff.
2269520	2273520	My point being, who God knows what soldiers do after a while,
2273520	2275520	because even actors,
2275520	2279520	which is just that little bit of like camaraderie and fatigue
2279520	2281520	and reliance on each other,
2281520	2285520	the behavior already starts to get unrecognizable
2285520	2288520	from the perspective of the normal world.
2293520	2295520	Would have Dan, if you found somebody,
2295520	2299520	like there was a service, like a spa or something like that,
2299520	2301520	and you found there was a guy or a woman
2301520	2304520	that was really into and totally comfortable with
2304520	2307520	that kind of back extraction kind of service,
2307520	2309520	would you be down for that?
2309520	2311520	No, it was only because he sneak attacked you
2311520	2312520	and came up and did that.
2312520	2314520	Yeah, I wasn't like, oh, thank God he did that.
2314520	2316520	I'm so happy that got done.
2316520	2321520	It was only just that he defied my every fucking line
2321520	2324520	that I had drawn for his personality.
2324520	2327520	I tell you, he could have said like,
2327520	2329520	you know, I love Jenga.
2329520	2330520	I don't know.
2330520	2332520	He could have said anything just random.
2332520	2334520	He turned out to be a human being
2334520	2337520	and not like this fucking straw dog that I had created
2337520	2341520	and was like trying to figure out how to avoid a fight with.
2341520	2343520	He wasn't thinking that about me.
2343520	2346520	Otherwise, he wouldn't have popped my zit.
2346520	2348520	Like if he had made decisions about me
2348520	2350520	and was like that adherent to them,
2350520	2352520	I just like I've been drinking in bars so long
2352520	2354520	and I was like this is a fucking kind of knucklehead
2354520	2357520	that comes up and he just like, no, no, I'm too young.
2357520	2360520	Life is too short.
2360520	2365520	Have you ever been scrubbed at a Korean spa?
2365520	2368520	I used to go to this place called We Spots in Koreatown.
2368520	2369520	Oh, yeah.
2369520	2370520	Really cool.
2370520	2373520	I loved it there, but I mean, not to get weird because of this TV show.
2373520	2376520	I can't go there because I'll just be like nude and like chilling out
2376520	2378520	and somebody like, hey, fucking Richard.
2378520	2380520	I'd be like, I don't like this anymore.
2380520	2381520	You've ruined it.
2381520	2382520	You've ruined it.
2382520	2384520	But I used to go there and in the corner always,
2384520	2388520	there's like the full body scrubs where it's, you know, you're in the spa.
2388520	2389520	You're getting over your hang ups.
2389520	2390520	You're like, I'm nude.
2390520	2392520	I'm comfortable with that.
2392520	2395520	That guy's got the biggest dick I've ever seen in my life.
2395520	2398520	I don't care.
2398520	2401520	And then there are these people in the corner that they're like lying on the bed
2401520	2405520	and there's a man like, well, and then I'm sure a woman in the woman's part
2405520	2409520	and they are vigorously full body scrubbing the man who's lying down.
2409520	2414520	Like with, with like, I guess like a sponge and soap and like high pressure water
2414520	2416520	and they're up and they're crackling.
2416520	2417520	They're everywhere.
2417520	2422520	Their legs back and they're ripping around and then up in the thing
2422520	2425520	and they're scrubbing the crack and they're just like, ah, yeah.
2425520	2428520	And I was like, I've always looked at that with envy of like,
2428520	2431520	how could you have the security of your own body to be like,
2431520	2434520	scrub me as hard as you fucking can.
2434520	2441520	Like in any crevice I have, get in there and don't, don't pussy foot around.
2441520	2443520	You scrub me, you bitch.
2443520	2449520	And like, I can't, I can't, I can't.
2449520	2451520	And another gentleman you don't know.
2451520	2455520	Thomas, just surrender to the scrub.
2455520	2459520	Because the Korean spa, it's like being in the middle of a really sexy street fight.
2459520	2461520	Like you're getting your ass kicked.
2461520	2462520	Don't listen to him. Here's why.
2462520	2464520	If you have anxiety about that kind of thing,
2464520	2466520	well, those people that you think are your heroes in the moment,
2466520	2469520	like those are the same people that, you know what else they do really well?
2469520	2472520	They merge on the freeway. They don't give a fuck.
2472520	2474520	Because they have no anxiety.
2474520	2478520	They have no fear about anyone's judgment and they kill people.
2478520	2480520	They fucking murder people.
2480520	2483520	The first time you get a scrub is by accident.
2483520	2485520	You don't know. I'll get the full.
2485520	2486520	Have you ever had a scrub?
2486520	2487520	Oh, yeah.
2487520	2488520	You've had a full scrub?
2488520	2491520	Have you seen him drive? Have you seen him drive?
2491520	2494520	Do you use, do you use turn signals? Do you?
2494520	2495520	Have you seen me merge?
2495520	2496520	Do you use turn signals?
2496520	2498520	Oh, I'm like Baryshnikov.
2498520	2501520	Not only do I use turn signals, I indicate.
2501520	2502520	That's good.
2502520	2503520	I'm an indicator.
2503520	2504520	I call them indicators, too.
2504520	2505520	I'm an indicator.
2505520	2506520	I've got flak for calling them indicators.
2506520	2507520	I've been bullied.
2507520	2508520	I have a Scottish girlfriend.
2508520	2511520	Well, Dan and I and Karen and my Scottish ex-girlfriend
2511520	2513520	were in Scotland for the holidays a couple of years ago.
2513520	2514520	No, no, no, no, no, no.
2514520	2515520	Scrubs.
2515520	2516520	Right.
2516520	2517520	Don't try and tell me.
2517520	2518520	I don't want to know about Scotland.
2518520	2523520	I want to know about how the fuck you have the brass and the audacity
2523520	2525520	to get your body scrub.
2525520	2527520	My first scrub was a little...
2527520	2528520	Oh, my God.
2528520	2529520	You never forget your first scrub, by the way.
2529520	2530520	I wouldn't know.
2530520	2533520	The first scrub is the deepest.
2533520	2534520	It is deep.
2534520	2535520	They go deep.
2535520	2536520	Oh, it's fucking...
2536520	2537520	They get right up in there.
2537520	2540520	No, it's all hands on deck at this fucking scrubs, man.
2540520	2541520	Do they...
2541520	2542520	No, it's fucking...
2542520	2545520	But it's really vigorous.
2545520	2546520	Yeah.
2546520	2547520	And you're like, oh, my God.
2547520	2548520	I don't know that...
2548520	2551520	This might cross a line of my tolerance for...
2551520	2554520	Not intimacy, but this is really wild.
2554520	2557520	But the first time I did that, I went with a gal that was a friend of mine,
2557520	2560520	and we went to Little Tokyo, and they walk all over,
2560520	2562520	and your joints are cracking and popping.
2562520	2568520	And I faced down, trying to visualize what she could possibly be doing
2568520	2570520	to make the sensation that was going on.
2570520	2574520	I was like, does she have 40 elbows?
2574520	2576520	Did she call her friends in?
2576520	2578520	Like, what the fuck is going on?
2578520	2580520	They're gang scrubbing you.
2580520	2583520	Get them!
2583520	2585520	Wait, so you had a lady scrubber?
2585520	2586520	I had a lady scrubber.
2586520	2588520	Ooh!
2588520	2590520	Wouldn't fly a wee spa.
2590520	2592520	Are the Von Trapps back there?
2592520	2594520	I was trying to plus your bit.
2594520	2597520	Then she's moving a little slow tonight.
2597520	2600520	But one time I got a gift certificate a long time ago
2600520	2603520	to the Burke Williams in West Holly, which I think is gone,
2603520	2606520	which is like where Crunch is, like on Sunset and...
2606520	2607520	Crunch.
2607520	2609520	Like Crescent Heights, right?
2609520	2610520	So I went in there and...
2610520	2612520	It's Crunch near Pump.
2613520	2616520	Right across the street from Turf.
2619520	2620520	There's a dog groomer.
2620520	2623520	It's called Balls, for no reason.
2623520	2625520	And so I go into the spa.
2625520	2626520	I know that it's routine.
2626520	2627520	You get a locker.
2627520	2628520	You get a bathrobe.
2628520	2630520	You can choose your own adventure.
2630520	2633520	I can go into the tub and I can go into the sauna
2633520	2635520	or to the steam room.
2635520	2638520	Or I can sit and drink coconut lemon water.
2638520	2640520	Not coconut, like a cucumber or whatever.
2640520	2641520	Spa day.
2641520	2642520	I read a book.
2642520	2645520	But if you go into any of the facilities,
2645520	2648520	you have a towel or can be naked.
2648520	2650520	So I go into the steam room.
2650520	2651520	And I have my towel.
2651520	2652520	And you sit down.
2652520	2653520	I walk in.
2653520	2656520	And there was, let's say, seven, eight guys in there already.
2656520	2660520	Every one of them was the hottest guy you've ever seen.
2660520	2665520	Everybody was like David Beckham's hotter, younger brother.
2665520	2667520	And it was just like, just cock out.
2667520	2668520	And everyone's just talking.
2668520	2669520	Like, what are you getting?
2669520	2670520	I'm getting the Siemens.
2670520	2671520	It's not Siemens.
2671520	2673520	It's called...
2673520	2676520	The Siemens demise?
2676520	2677520	What was I going to say?
2677520	2678520	The Siemens repose?
2678520	2682520	There was one called The Hunter's Retreat.
2682520	2683520	And so there were all these names,
2683520	2684520	but there was scrubbing involved on the stuff.
2684520	2688520	So Eufroydian slipped from hunter to semen.
2688520	2690520	Well, I was saying, I was going nautical,
2690520	2691520	to be honest with you.
2691520	2692520	Okay.
2692520	2693520	All right.
2693520	2694520	That's the connection.
2694520	2695520	I failed at the show.
2695520	2698520	Notice that's the second time I said semen already.
2698520	2699520	This is my alarm, by the way.
2699520	2700520	This is your...
2700520	2703520	Just wrap it up, because he's got a heart out,
2703520	2705520	and I want to play Shadow Run with him before he goes.
2705520	2706520	Okay. All right.
2706520	2707520	But that doesn't mean we're ending the show earlier.
2707520	2709520	We're just going to get our guest on.
2709520	2711520	I was completely intimidated by the...
2711520	2714520	Everybody was so gorgeous and walking around,
2714520	2717520	but I found out they ended up having to close that one down supposedly
2717520	2719520	because it was so sexy in there.
2719520	2722520	Like, there was lots of shenanigans happening.
2722520	2725520	It sounds like you're describing a place in West Hollywood.
2725520	2727520	Yes, it was.
2728520	2730520	That's why the...
2730520	2731520	I'm not going to say anything.
2731520	2734520	I'm just going to look like that.
2734520	2736520	That's why they also had to close down balls.
2736520	2738520	The dog group.
2738520	2740520	Because the dogs are fucking...
2740520	2741520	Pump is still pumping, though.
2741520	2742520	Just full.
2742520	2746520	Just Jack Russell's walking around with their fucking slongs wagging,
2746520	2747520	as much as their tails.
2747520	2750520	Geez, sucking each other's dog dicks.
2750520	2754520	Let's build this fucking wall.
2754520	2756520	Dogs would come so hard...
2756520	2760520	That the other dog would fetch the cum and bring it back.
2761520	2764520	These are fucking hot, gay dogs.
2764520	2767520	They shut that place down.
2767520	2769520	It wasn't a health hazard.
2769520	2771520	These were the cleanest fucking dogs in the world.
2771520	2777520	It was a cultural threat because it was fucking changing minds.
2777520	2781520	Thomas, would you be open for a scrub by a woman scrubber?
2781520	2783520	It's very intimate.
2784520	2790520	I wouldn't mind getting scrubbed all over.
2790520	2793520	Even on the junk, in a non-sexual way.
2793520	2797520	I couldn't picture a less sexy thing to be like...
2797520	2798520	All over your dick.
2798520	2799520	I wouldn't get hard on that.
2799520	2801520	I'd be like...
2803520	2806520	But it's more about up the butt crack.
2806520	2808520	Are you worried about the...
2808520	2810520	I would be worried about...
2810520	2812520	My butt crack will never be clean.
2812520	2816520	Yeah, I'm worried about a dirty butt hole.
2816520	2817520	And then my...
2817520	2819520	I'm being like a too hairy of a butt.
2819520	2821520	They're like, I didn't expect it.
2821520	2822520	Those go together.
2822520	2826520	It will never be clean because it's like a fucking carpet back then.
2826520	2830520	And if you, at home, if you had in the middle of your living room,
2830520	2831520	your carpeted living room,
2831520	2836520	if there was a hole that shit came out of three times a day,
2836520	2839520	it just wouldn't matter what you did in that room.
2839520	2841520	Never, ever, ever.
2841520	2844520	Sweetheart, we got to do something about this carpet.
2845520	2846520	You ever notice this?
2846520	2847520	It's three times a day.
2847520	2850520	They said it was a stain master, but it's a stain creator.
2850520	2851520	Hey!
2855520	2858520	Let's bring out Demorge Brown, who has been...
2867520	2869520	Demorge Brown.
2870520	2872520	With the greenest pants in town.
2873520	2874520	They're just green, man.
2874520	2877520	They're just green pants. That's all it is.
2877520	2879520	Look at this haircut, man.
2879520	2880520	I love it.
2880520	2881520	Very handsome.
2882520	2883520	There's no cleans up.
2883520	2884520	There's no non-handsome person.
2884520	2885520	No, there isn't.
2885520	2888520	I was going to say, I can't even remember the previous look now.
2888520	2890520	I haven't seen Demorge in a million years, but I was like,
2890520	2893520	uh-oh, but English is in class session.
2894520	2895520	Yup.
2895520	2896520	Yup.
2897520	2902520	My English teacher's here, and I've been bad at English.
2903520	2906520	Are you hoping he, like, paddles you?
2906520	2907520	Yeah.
2907520	2911520	Keep me after class, Professor Clean Cut.
2911520	2912520	We'll do it in class, man.
2912520	2915520	Teach me some conjunctivitis.
2918520	2920520	Teach me how to conjugate your eyeballs.
2923520	2924520	Where you been, Demorge?
2924520	2925520	Tell us about your travels.
2925520	2927520	I actually haven't been traveling a whole lot.
2927520	2928520	I've just been working a lot.
2928520	2931520	It gets to this time of year, and people want to get stuff done before people
2931520	2932520	start disappearing for holidays.
2932520	2935520	So I've just been shooting a bunch of stuff, little short films here and there.
2935520	2938520	And then also Channel 101 ends in October.
2938520	2942520	And so from the end of October to about the middle of October,
2942520	2943520	or the end of September to the middle of October,
2943520	2945520	they were just project after project with people,
2945520	2947520	trying to slam and get something done.
2947520	2949520	It's like sweeps week, kind of.
2949520	2950520	Yeah.
2950520	2952520	And then Kill the Baby, which Aaron was also,
2953520	2957520	finished with a finale, which was like a 20-minute finale.
2957520	2959520	And people have lives and things.
2959520	2961520	So everybody only shoots on the weekends.
2961520	2962520	And there you go.
2962520	2964520	So Saturday, Sunday, Saturday, Sunday, Saturday, Sunday,
2964520	2966520	Sunday, Saturday, Sunday.
2966520	2968520	You ever had a scrub?
2970520	2971520	I have been to the Wii Spa.
2971520	2973520	I have never, I have seen that stuff.
2973520	2975520	I have not gone anywhere near that.
2975520	2977520	I don't have any interest in that.
2977520	2978520	I see.
2978520	2981520	I have an interest, but I'm so scared.
2981520	2985520	I am like looking into Sauron's eye,
2985520	2988520	but like falling in love at the same time.
2988520	2991520	What danger in this scrub?
2991520	2993520	When you leave after the whole,
2993520	2995520	when you get the whole kit and caboodle,
2995520	2996520	when you leave there, you feel,
2996520	2998520	it's like it's a crazy euphoria kind of feeling.
2998520	3001520	Because your butthole's been titillated.
3001520	3004520	Because you just got your fucking prostate jammed.
3004520	3007520	Your butthole shines like a new dime.
3007520	3009520	Somebody else could look into your butthole
3009520	3010520	and see themselves.
3010520	3013520	But I equate all that stuff, like there's always like,
3013520	3015520	like Chris McKenna would, for the writers,
3015520	3017520	if we were working them too hard,
3017520	3019520	he'd like hire a masseuse to come
3019520	3021520	and like set up in a spare room
3021520	3023520	and like the writers have been up all night.
3023520	3024520	Love massage.
3024520	3026520	No, I won't even do that.
3026520	3028520	Shirt on massage, I won't even do it.
3028520	3031520	Because it's like, I'm so insecure
3031520	3033520	that the idea of a professional person,
3033520	3038520	like who has therefore seen the widest range of people
3038520	3040520	and touched them all,
3040520	3042520	it doesn't really make any logical sense.
3042520	3044520	But I'm just like, oh, they're going to definitely know
3044520	3047520	for sure that I'm a bad person.
3047520	3049520	Which is how I feel also about prostitution.
3049520	3053520	Like when people go like, well, if you're lonely
3053520	3055520	and you say that you're not going to be able
3055520	3057520	to sustain relationships,
3057520	3059520	why are you talking about getting mannequins?
3059520	3062520	I have to catch up with you with this stuff.
3062520	3066520	But why not go to Las Vegas
3066520	3069520	and engage in your legal right to,
3069520	3070520	I don't know, are you kidding me?
3070520	3071520	Never.
3071520	3073520	That would be the last thing I did after skydiving.
3073520	3075520	Like I would never, like trying heroin.
3075520	3078520	Like I, heroin I'd try first
3078520	3081520	and then, let's get back to that.
3081520	3085520	But like the idea of a sex worker,
3085520	3090520	like I'd be like, you, she knows for sure.
3090520	3093520	Like how my dick places on the size chart.
3093520	3096520	And also just like every love handle,
3096520	3099520	every hair, she's like, I've seen it all
3099520	3101520	and here's where you are.
3101520	3102520	And she'd be thinking it.
3102520	3105520	I bet her thoughts are more like, sorry.
3105520	3107520	Yeah, but that's part of the problem.
3107520	3110520	I guess I can't like, I'm not confident enough
3110520	3113520	to like the idea, because you'd know the whole time.
3113520	3116520	You'd be like, well, for sure she'd rather be somewhere else.
3116520	3120520	That's like, I would never be able to do anything.
3120520	3122520	Spencer, would you get a script?
3123520	3124520	Sure, yeah.
3124520	3126520	From a prostitute?
3126520	3129520	Only from a prostitute, yeah.
3129520	3131520	Spencer doesn't give a fuck.
3131520	3134520	I've hired prostitutes to wash me
3134520	3137520	just because I can't reach all the time.
3143520	3146520	The ship's horn, like the ship's foghorn.
3146520	3149520	That's the sound effect I wanted after that one.
3149520	3151520	I knew the sound.
3151520	3152520	I just, you know.
3152520	3154520	It's like the fog had rolled in.
3154520	3156520	The fog of, yeah.
3156520	3158520	It's just something that goes with, yeah.
3158520	3160520	If Thomas has to bone out in a bit,
3160520	3161520	we should get this started.
3161520	3162520	Yeah, well.
3162520	3163520	Yeah, come on, dudes.
3163520	3165520	I gotta bone out.
3165520	3167520	Everybody's saying it.
3170520	3172520	On this show, probably like three times a show.
3172520	3175520	That's the ad for Creepshow 2.
3175520	3177520	We're gonna bone out.
3177520	3179520	This summer, everyone's boning out.
3180520	3182520	It's all inside.
3182520	3185520	We should bring up one person
3185520	3191520	and let's make it a crassly gender-balancing casting decision.
3191520	3195520	Well, bringing up one woman is not gonna balance out the stage.
3196520	3198520	Okay, let's nitpick semantics,
3198520	3200520	but also let's get a young lady or an old lady.
3200520	3201520	Why a young lady?
3201520	3203520	No, the youngest lady.
3203520	3205520	No, let's get to it.
3205520	3208520	I want all the women to organize themselves
3208520	3210520	via birthday.
3212520	3214520	If there are any in the same year,
3214520	3216520	we'll do it by month.
3216520	3219520	Let's get the oldies up front, youngies in the back.
3219520	3221520	My politeness gland kicks in
3221520	3223520	because I get so nervous when I'm talking about
3223520	3224520	anything where I'm like,
3224520	3225520	you're outside your safety zone,
3225520	3226520	you're gonna say something wrong.
3226520	3229520	I was just like, oh, young lady.
3229520	3232520	There's times when that's so creepy-sounding.
3232520	3237520	Anyways, anybody interested?
3237520	3240520	We were getting somebody a heart attack with our zit story.
3240520	3242520	Would you like to come up?
3242520	3243520	I like Poppy Pimples.
3243520	3247520	Well, we had someone raise their hand,
3247520	3250520	so it's not...
3250520	3253520	That got immediately awkward and strange.
3253520	3255520	Would you be willing to come up?
3255520	3256520	You raised your hand, okay, yeah.
3256520	3258520	Pimple popper or hand raiser?
3258520	3259520	Hand raiser.
3259520	3261520	No, of course hand raiser, obviously.
3262520	3264520	Well, because she was first.
3267520	3270520	Not because pickle person was a bad person at all.
3270520	3272520	That's fine what pickle person did,
3272520	3274520	but she raised her hand first.
3274520	3275520	What is your name?
3275520	3276520	My name is Cassie.
3276520	3277520	Cassie, hello.
3277520	3278520	Hello, Cassie.
3278520	3279520	Hi, Cassie.
3279520	3280520	Thank you for joining us.
3280520	3281520	I think that should be enough people.
3281520	3282520	It's okay.
3282520	3283520	I really just came up here because I wanted a water.
3283520	3284520	Can I get one of those?
3284520	3285520	Oh, yeah.
3285520	3287520	Are you using us for bottled water?
3287520	3289520	I thought you were using my hand just to ask for it,
3289520	3290520	but this is a great opportunity.
3290520	3292520	Well, would you like to leave and let the pickle lady come up?
3292520	3293520	Oh, okay.
3293520	3294520	What's that?
3294520	3295520	Happy beater.
3295520	3296520	Okay, okay, good.
3296520	3298520	All right.
3298520	3299520	A little undersold.
3299520	3303520	I did want you to just grab that and then go back up.
3303520	3306520	You would have really won the tournament.
3306520	3308520	Just go right out the side door and just leave.
3308520	3309520	Oh, was that supposed to take one?
3309520	3310520	Yeah.
3310520	3312520	There's one for Demorridge and then there's, yeah.
3312520	3315520	Basically...
3315520	3318520	Oh, I'll be Kumail Nanjiani.
3321520	3324520	All right.
3324520	3326520	And so that character is Dr. Friend, I believe, right?
3326520	3327520	Yes.
3327520	3329520	He's kind of like a mob doctor archetype.
3329520	3331520	He's the guy who patches us up.
3331520	3333520	Kumail.
3333520	3335520	Man, why'd you make me the fucking troll?
3335520	3337520	He's a troll, right?
3337520	3338520	I think he's a troll.
3338520	3339520	Look at all the equipment.
3339520	3340520	Oh, he's a troll.
3340520	3342520	Middle Ditch is an avid gamer that kind of makes you feel bad
3342520	3347520	because he has a game going with real people who sit down
3347520	3348520	and really game.
3348520	3350520	He was doing Call of Cthulhu and now he's doing...
3350520	3351520	We just did GURPS, man.
3351520	3352520	We're all GURPS.
3352520	3354520	And I asked Thomas on...
3354520	3356520	Dora, we're shooting Hermaquests.
3356520	3357520	Could I join your group?
3357520	3358520	He's like, no.
3358520	3359520	Yeah.
3359520	3363520	Well, the death knell to any good gaming group is accepting new members.
3363520	3366520	Suddenly you have a tight group of four and then you're like,
3366520	3367520	yeah, so-and-so's...
3367520	3369520	Yeah, scheduling gets involved.
3369520	3370520	It's over.
3370520	3371520	No.
3371520	3373520	That's why it was both admirable and it was like, fuck,
3373520	3374520	then you really want in.
3374520	3375520	Oh, man.
3376520	3378520	So it's a candy store and it's locked.
3378520	3380520	Yeah, it's a closed candy store.
3380520	3381520	Pretty fucking insane.
3381520	3382520	With only windows.
3384520	3386520	And sounds of kids enjoying candy.
3387520	3389520	What does that sound like?
3392520	3395520	All right, well, I'm starting to not want to get into the candy store.
3395520	3397520	No, no, we've all seen Spotlight by now.
3397520	3398520	It's just...
3400520	3402520	Cassie, you're playing whom?
3402520	3403520	Who?
3403520	3405520	My name's Erin McGathey.
3410520	3411520	Yeah.
3411520	3412520	Can we...
3412520	3413520	Who?
3413520	3414520	Can we have...
3414520	3415520	Dan?
3415520	3416520	Dan?
3416520	3417520	Maybe a bad pitch.
3417520	3419520	Maybe a bad pitch.
3420520	3421520	Can we have her play as...
3421520	3423520	Just Erin McGathey playing...
3423520	3424520	McGathey.
3424520	3425520	No, that's...
3425520	3426520	She's Erin's character.
3426520	3427520	It's just that clip.
3427520	3428520	Five...
3428520	3430520	That five second clip is like such a...
3430520	3432520	Out of context would be such a...
3432520	3434520	Weird thing to like send to Erin.
3436520	3437520	She'd be like, what are you doing?
3437520	3438520	Oh, I don't know.
3442520	3446520	All right, so Spencer, what do you think about life and ISIS?
3446520	3449520	Oh, overrated both of them.
3452520	3453520	I agree.
3453520	3454520	I agree.
3455520	3456520	Don't worry about that.
3457520	3458520	All right, Spencer, do we need...
3458520	3461520	I've been away from Shadowrun for like a couple of months, it feels like.
3461520	3462520	So let's just...
3462520	3464520	Where were we when we last left off?
3464520	3466520	Do you have a recap or do you just want to fill it in fast?
3466520	3471520	Oh, our guest's recap was written by no one, you fucking assholes.
3472520	3473520	Not you guys.
3473520	3475520	You guys in the live crowd are fine.
3475520	3477520	It's internet people I'm mad at.
3477520	3481520	Spencer, I'm going to play some music and you're going to give us a brief recap, please.
3481520	3482520	All right, what...
3482520	3483520	Yeah.
3485520	3487520	Last time on Shadowrun.
3487520	3493520	Our heroes returned to their mission to store quests to find the MP3s.
3493520	3497520	They brought them all back, accomplishing their mission.
3498520	3503520	Back at the bar, they assailed a woman the second she walked in a door,
3504520	3510520	not letting her drink, bothering her with questions and then raping her mind.
3511520	3524520	Eventually, they pulled a quest out of her, finding the whereabouts of her lost daughter, last seen at Flesh to Fresh,
3525520	3530520	a support group for ghouls, survivors of the HMHVV disease.
3531520	3534520	They're still there in that tavern, bothering the ladies.
3537520	3538520	On Harmon.
3538520	3541520	And have we agreed on a price to bring your daughter back?
3541520	3542520	I think there was a price agreed on, yeah.
3542520	3544520	What was the woman's name?
3545520	3546520	Peggy, right?
3547520	3548520	I don't know.
3548520	3549520	Well, right.
3551520	3554520	Peggy, what's your daughter's name?
3554520	3555520	Jem.
3555520	3556520	Jem?
3556520	3558520	She's truly outrageous.
3562520	3565520	Now, is she a ghoul trying to get fresh again?
3565520	3566520	Yeah.
3566520	3567520	Yeah.
3567520	3568520	She's a ghoul.
3568520	3573520	You know, they have this craving for flesh, dead flesh, not living flesh.
3573520	3574520	You see?
3574520	3576520	They don't want to eat you.
3576520	3578520	They want to murder you and then eat you.
3578520	3579520	Right.
3579520	3582520	So they can handle it with therapy and stuff.
3582520	3586520	And she's been trying to control her urges and she's been making good progress.
3587520	3588520	Well, she stopped being a ghoul.
3588520	3590520	She had to stop eating dead people.
3590520	3592520	She'll just stop eating dead people.
3592520	3594520	I mean, a ghoul is just a person with a disease, you know?
3594520	3596520	It's a condition.
3596520	3597520	Right.
3597520	3599520	Is future Trump running for president?
3599520	3601520	Can we just build a ghoul wall?
3603520	3608520	I mean, I'm asking you to find my daughter, not prevent her from getting to me.
3609520	3610520	Sorry.
3610520	3612520	That's just classic doctor friend humor.
3615520	3619520	Spencer, what's our, what's our, our, our, our hat guy?
3619520	3620520	Is hat guy with us or no?
3620520	3621520	Hat guy's at the bar, yeah.
3621520	3623520	Let's remember to take him with us this time.
3624520	3630520	I walk over to hat guy and say, hey, can you get a location on, on, on Jim?
3632520	3633520	No, no.
3633520	3636520	Oh, we got to go to, we got to go to flesh to fresh.
3636520	3638520	Okay. Thanks, hat guy.
3638520	3641520	My name's not a hat guy. I'm Jim Nightblade.
3641520	3645520	No, I know that I was thanking hat guy for bothering him because he was...
3645520	3650520	Would it be out of, out of order for us to call in Uber and proceed to the club?
3653520	3658520	The flesh to fresh has been explained up and disappeared.
3658520	3662520	That's one of the reasons it's been so hard to find traces of the daughter.
3662520	3665520	The whole place just, just up and vanished.
3665520	3669520	Well, who in this town's got a vendetta against ghouls?
3670520	3673520	The town of, where are we, New Berlin? New Los Angeles?
3673520	3674520	New Seattle.
3674520	3675520	New something?
3675520	3676520	Seattle.
3676520	3677520	New Seattle.
3679520	3681520	Now hold on a second. Who, who was that?
3681520	3682520	Was that, was that Piggy talking?
3682520	3683520	Oh, that was me.
3683520	3684520	Oh, hat guy?
3684520	3688520	No, that was the DM reminding Hordegard of the past.
3688520	3696520	Oh, the, the, the, wait, but everybody in, I'm sorry, I apologize, but I, I, the building didn't disappear. It was just all the people.
3698520	3701520	Well, no. I mean, the building got blown up.
3701520	3702520	Oh.
3702520	3703520	So it kind of disappeared.
3703520	3704520	Okay.
3704520	3705520	Oh, so it didn't get...
3705520	3707520	What a childlike description of explosions.
3708520	3713520	So the place just got, just got raised and eradicated and demolished. Seems that way.
3713520	3715520	Oh, is there a body count?
3715520	3723520	Oh, you know, there wasn't one labeled, but explosion that size, it wasn't an explosion.
3725520	3726520	Yeah, yeah.
3726520	3731520	It was, it was more of a fire, but had to have some casualties.
3731520	3733520	Were there police outside? Cause then we know it's at least 500.
3734520	3736520	Oh, there's always police.
3736520	3739520	It's a good callback, Aaron McGathey.
3746520	3752520	Well, in, in this, are there skills like street wise or anything like that?
3752520	3758520	I have a contact with the mofioso. I could ask some questions. Possibly he's reasonably loyal.
3758520	3761520	There's both of those things. Yeah. There's contacts and...
3761520	3764520	I have contacts with gang members around town.
3764520	3766520	All of you should probably have contacts.
3766520	3767520	Oh yeah.
3767520	3768520	Just the lenses.
3768520	3776520	I look around the bar, Spencer, and I try to see if I can locate any of my gang contacts or someone in the gangs that I know.
3776520	3779520	No one in any gangs you know are in the bar right now.
3779520	3782520	I do the exact same. I'm looking for a fellow named Ritz.
3782520	3786520	Hank's the, Hank and Hawkeye are the only guys in the bar. Oh, and Peggy.
3786520	3793520	I'm going to place a call on the future phone to my friend Phil, a lone star.
3793520	3794520	Okay.
3794520	3798520	But I'm going to kind of keep it secret from these guys because I don't want them to know that I was a former lone star.
3798520	3804520	I'm a precog and I'm anticipating that Jim Nightblade might make a call to the lone star.
3806520	3810520	But I will keep this to myself because I'm not stupid.
3810520	3816520	It's good. That's good. Okay.
3816520	3818520	Beep, boop, beep, beep, beep.
3818520	3820520	Oh, hello.
3823520	3825520	Is that Jimmy?
3825520	3829520	Yeah. That's my name as of now.
3829520	3832520	What was it again? Was it the old one?
3832520	3835520	Nah, it's all backstory and steeped in mystery.
3835520	3837520	All right.
3838520	3843520	So listen, you got to lie. What do you know about the flesh to fresh company?
3843520	3849520	Oh, those clinics? Oh, man. Those ghoul clinics, they've been popping up all over.
3849520	3855520	They're real, real, real meat markets. I tell you what.
3855520	3860520	Say, what do you mean? They don't just engage in the product as advertised?
3860520	3871520	Oh, they do. They offer all sorts of services like flesh replacements and flesh treatments and also brain zapping.
3873520	3875520	To make people not ghoulish?
3875520	3883520	They do all sorts of stuff, but it's been said, you know, they have ties to the Chinese mob.
3883520	3885520	China?
3885520	3889520	I just said that for no reason. I'm sorry.
3889520	3892520	Just thinking about China.
3895520	3898520	Bring back our jobs.
3899520	3903520	So, all right, Phil, thank you very much. Thanks.
3903520	3904520	Bye now.
3904520	3905520	Goodbye.
3905520	3908520	So I feel like I'm kind of stupid sometimes.
3908520	3914520	Why aren't we just going to the place because, as you said, it just got blown up.
3914520	3916520	But there's places opening up all over?
3916520	3921520	Should we go to the wreckage of the place and kind of look around for evidence?
3921520	3924520	We could do that. Ironically.
3927520	3930520	Not as funny anymore.
3930520	3933520	I understand.
3933520	3937520	Yeah, well, we could go to a crater and poke around.
3937520	3942520	Well, they have ties to the Chinese mob. Should we go and investigate local Chinese mob hangouts and do some surveillance on that?
3942520	3945520	I know. Just the place. Don't I?
3945520	3949520	Let's find out.
3949520	3952520	Yeah, no, I mean, you have all sorts of connections.
3952520	3955520	Yeah, you're a doctor. You probably worked with a Chinese mob before, Dr. Friend.
3955520	3960520	Inconclusive medicine, but I know the types.
3960520	3963520	I didn't ask you to judge their medical students.
3963520	3967520	Well, it's a bit of hocus pocus and tiger blood, etc.
3967520	3970520	It's a very sweeping statement to make out about.
3970520	3974520	It's disgusting filth, really.
3975520	3977520	We're finding out.
3977520	3978520	Not very much of a friend.
3978520	3981520	Dr. Friend's a little racist.
3981520	3987520	I'm saying, you're a doctor. Have you ever treated any of the Chinese mafiosis before?
3987520	3992520	Once, back in the 80s, the 3080s.
3996520	4000520	It was a call I hoped never to receive again.
4000520	4003520	They held a gun to my head and said, fix him, fix him.
4003520	4006520	Those are the only words they knew.
4006520	4008520	That's it? That's handy.
4008520	4011520	It was, extremely.
4011520	4014520	What condition was the patient?
4014520	4018520	Oh, gunshot wounds, you know, criminal stuff.
4018520	4023520	I remember his name exactly. It was...
4023520	4025520	David.
4025520	4029520	David the China Man.
4030520	4033520	David McChina Man.
4033520	4039520	It's only been 3,000 years. It should be easy to track him down.
4039520	4040520	Yeah.
4040520	4043520	What, are we in the year 6000?
4043520	4045520	No, no. I fucked that part up.
4045520	4046520	It's okay.
4046520	4051520	I'm not a smart guy. I'm here because I do the sneakies and the creepies.
4051520	4053520	We know, we know.
4053520	4057520	Dr. Friend, do you know a Chinese mob hanging out nearby?
4057520	4061520	Yes. The Golden Hole.
4065520	4068520	Hey, it's a nano-opium den.
4074520	4077520	All kinds of unsavory types hanging out there.
4077520	4083520	I was so scared that part of that name would end up being inappropriately Asian,
4083520	4087520	but boy, it just turned out to be just Golden Hole.
4087520	4089520	Golden Hole.
4089520	4093520	It's as if the people who named the restaurant in the middle of naming it
4093520	4096520	was tailspun in white gilts.
4096520	4097520	Yes.
4097520	4099520	And just bailed.
4099520	4100520	Yes.
4100520	4104520	Yep. The Golden Hole and the entryways through the back.
4108520	4110520	Should we take the hover van?
4110520	4112520	Yes.
4113520	4114520	See how it's taken.
4114520	4116520	Is the Golden Hole by pump?
4116520	4119520	Yes. It's by pump, which is still raging.
4119520	4120520	Still pumping.
4120520	4121520	Still pumping.
4121520	4124520	Well, we usually franchise. There's one here in New Seattle now.
4124520	4127520	We usually take Neo-Obers where we need to go.
4127520	4131520	I call an Uber. I've already called Uber, so it should be outside right now.
4131520	4133520	Hong Kong.
4134520	4136520	Impatient as ever.
4136520	4137520	Shotgun.
4137520	4138520	All right.
4138520	4141520	So we're going to the Golden Hole to talk to the Chinese mob.
4142520	4147520	Dr. Fretin, I have a question. Did David the Chinaman make it?
4148520	4152520	Oh, yes. What do you take me for? Some kind of Chinese doctor?
4153520	4156520	Thomas Middleton just has to leave, everybody.
4157520	4160520	I think he would have wanted that to be his closure.
4164520	4166520	He's got an early call time.
4167520	4169520	Thank you so much, man.
4170520	4171520	Thank you.
4172520	4175520	Yeah, if you like Silicon Valley, then you'll appreciate him leaving.
4175520	4178520	It could be bright and bushy for it.
4186520	4189520	We're kind of going to miss his intel.
4189520	4190520	Oh, yeah. Definitely.
4190520	4192520	He knew a lot about the Chinese mob.
4192520	4196520	Oh, yeah. But just in general, also, the show is just going to take a fucking nosedive now.
4197520	4199520	Energy. I mean, he's contrary to his name.
4199520	4202520	That guy is like an extreme ditch.
4204520	4205520	Of entertainment.
4205520	4206520	Like it's like way.
4206520	4211520	It's a definitive like it's then there's nothing like like.
4212520	4214520	See. All right.
4215520	4223520	Should we stop the Shadowrun game there because he left or should we just say that he fell down and went to sleep and then continue to.
4223520	4225520	I mean, we have a lot of show.
4225520	4226520	A lot of show.
4226520	4229520	No. Yeah. But I thought I thought I did something experimental.
4229520	4231520	I moved the Shadowrun game to the middle of the show.
4231520	4232520	I didn't expect to play.
4232520	4234520	We're contractually forbidden.
4235520	4236520	Alleged.
4236520	4238520	Although I'm not that scared about the enforcement of that rule.
4238520	4239520	I don't think anyone really cares.
4239520	4240520	It's just lawyer stuff.
4240520	4244520	But we are supposed to just play for like 10 minutes and and always.
4245520	4249520	I think I think what happened there was a nice little tee up to us playing a proper round show.
4249520	4250520	Exactly. Exactly. Yeah.
4250520	4251520	Yeah.
4252520	4254520	It's going to be diminishing returns.
4254520	4256520	But you can stay up here.
4256520	4257520	Cassie is it.
4257520	4258520	All right.
4258520	4259520	Yeah.
4259520	4260520	We've got a new friend up here.
4260520	4261520	We got to more.
4261520	4262520	We got handsome.
4262520	4263520	Demorge.
4263520	4264520	The handsome.
4265520	4278520	Demorge was always handsome but now we have naughty college professor liberal liberal college professor with his inappropriate jokes that he makes in the margins of your essays.
4280520	4283520	This is pretty good for someone with such nice gams.
4285520	4287520	A run on sentence from you.
4287520	4288520	Come on.
4288520	4289520	You're so pretty.
4295520	4298520	A lot of talk about off the office hours.
4298520	4299520	Yeah.
4299520	4300520	Office hours indeed.
4300520	4302520	Cassie where'd you grow up.
4302520	4303520	Columbus Ohio.
4303520	4304520	Oh yeah.
4304520	4305520	That's right.
4305520	4306520	My mom was born.
4306520	4307520	Me too.
4309520	4310520	Your mom was born there as well.
4310520	4311520	No.
4311520	4312520	Oh.
4312520	4313520	Sorry.
4313520	4315520	I think you might have to eat that Mike Cassie.
4315520	4316520	It might be.
4316520	4317520	What.
4317520	4318520	Yeah.
4318520	4319520	There we go.
4319520	4320520	Put it closer than you'd think was appropriate.
4320520	4321520	OK.
4321520	4322520	Yeah.
4322520	4324520	Oh by the way also if you get uncomfortable you can leave.
4324520	4328520	I always say that to everybody regardless of the context.
4330520	4331520	But yeah.
4331520	4333520	Well tell us more about yourself.
4333520	4335520	So are you visiting Los Angeles.
4335520	4336520	No I live here.
4336520	4337520	I live in Koreatown.
4337520	4338520	All right.
4338520	4339520	Well I lived in Koreatown too when I first moved down here.
4339520	4340520	That was my first neighborhood.
4340520	4341520	Yeah.
4341520	4342520	Yeah.
4342520	4344520	I just moved out here and it's really cheap because I'm the only white.
4344520	4345520	So.
4345520	4346520	Right.
4346520	4347520	It's all.
4347520	4351520	It's and it's not not for that reason but it's a little scary over there still isn't
4351520	4352520	it.
4352520	4353520	Is it.
4353520	4354520	Is it been.
4354520	4355520	It's not that bad.
4355520	4357520	I mean I've only heard like one gunshot.
4357520	4358520	So I feel like that's pretty solid.
4358520	4359520	What's for you.
4359520	4363520	I mean like don't give us your address but like what what corner like are you near.
4363520	4367520	I'm like right next to like Wilshire and Mariposa.
4367520	4368520	Okay.
4368520	4369520	Yeah.
4369520	4373520	I lived there like 9th and Serrano back in the like early mid 90s.
4373520	4376520	And at one point the LAPD called it the most dangerous neighborhood in Los Angeles and
4376520	4378520	it was it was gunshots every night.
4378520	4382520	And like not just a couple but like like Wild Wild West Beirut.
4382520	4384520	It must have changed since then.
4384520	4389520	You got held up and and and I've already told the story when I was in the short time I was
4389520	4390520	living there.
4390520	4394520	And this is almost kind of a separate thing because it's like when a homeless person kills
4394520	4398520	another homeless person it's sort of like that's just that's not a neighborhood thing.
4398520	4399520	It's like oh it's that.
4399520	4400520	That's like oh my god.
4400520	4401520	There's so many homeless.
4401520	4402520	Nature.
4402520	4409520	This is like a homeless population thing like but but but like yeah like a homeless guy
4409520	4414360	killed another homeless guy like like big in the like in my backyard essentially except
4414360	4419640	there was a fence between my backyard and the area where the homeless would congregate.
4419640	4422560	Not exciting news but Koreatown.
4422600	4428560	Sounds sounds a little more fun than it was back then anyway.
4428560	4429560	It's really nice.
4429560	4432560	I mean there are some good bars and there's really good food and it's really cheap which
4432560	4434560	is cool because I'm super poor.
4434560	4435560	Yeah.
4435560	4436560	Yeah.
4436560	4437560	What do you what do you want to do to get rich.
4437560	4439560	Oh I'm a health care designer.
4439560	4440560	OK.
4442560	4446560	That's that's that's a combination of words I've never heard in my life.
4446560	4452560	So so this is like you can just you just you designing like like programs like like
4452560	4456560	designing like places where people receive care for their health.
4456560	4458560	Oh like like designing hospitals.
4458560	4459560	Yeah.
4459560	4460560	Floor plans.
4460560	4461560	Yeah.
4461560	4465560	So like like not an architect but and not an interior decorator.
4465560	4471560	Like in between there is like somebody really important that's going like put the put the
4471560	4475560	triage unit here so the people if somebody runs in their arms cut off like they can you
4475560	4478560	like scientifically figuring out how to lay out.
4478560	4479560	Yeah it's stuff like that.
4479560	4480560	Yeah.
4480560	4481560	Yeah.
4481560	4484560	I work for an architecture firm and I'm interior designer at that architecture firm so people
4484560	4487560	build places and then we make sure they have walls and stuff.
4487560	4493560	Give us give us some like what's a what's like a what's a term that only health care
4493560	4494560	designers know.
4494560	4499560	That's like when the next time we're in a hospital we can sound like a foot like the equivalent
4499560	4503560	of feng shui but for health care design that we can look like if I go in it because I cut
4503560	4508560	my pinky off and I like I'm feeling like I'm being brushed off that I can just at least
4508560	4512560	in my tirade I can go look you think I don't know what the fuck's going on here.
4512560	4517560	This place doesn't even have an open alpha way.
4517560	4522560	You know how fucking dangerous that is.
4522560	4525560	Like just give me some ammo.
4525560	4530560	Everything is an acronym so you could probably just make up acronyms for like what happened
4530560	4531560	to you.
4531560	4535560	You're like I cut off my pinky so it's like I C O M P.
4535560	4537560	You can just trail around.
4537560	4538560	Everything is acronyms.
4538560	4541560	If you talk to people I work with I'm like oh cool what does that stand for and they're
4541560	4542560	like I don't know.
4542560	4543560	Yeah.
4543560	4544560	And I'm like.
4544560	4545560	Just saying that's good.
4545560	4546560	Okay thanks.
4546560	4548560	So you design like hospitals or.
4548560	4550560	Yeah hospitals clinics you guys know like.
4550560	4555560	It seems to me that in the structure of those places there are a lot of hallways or corridors
4555560	4560560	that are set up with rooms in them that have no specific definition so that they're free
4560560	4565560	to be changed like in ICU's or rooms that become adaptable because there are eight people
4565560	4569560	on that day who have to be vertical and have to be washed at any time.
4569560	4572560	But there could be zero at that point that room could be something else.
4572560	4573560	Yes.
4573560	4578560	Is that what you mean by putting walls like putting walls in a place.
4578560	4584560	I mean like I mean you have to have walls in a hospital but I don't know I just do like
4584560	4587560	we do floor plans we do layouts we end up picking all the finishes making sure they're
4587560	4591560	like if some guy throws up on a couch it's cleanable.
4591560	4597560	Is there is there a guy I picture I picture going to the health care design job I picture
4597560	4603560	that there's like these these programs where you can bring up a floor plan of a hospital
4603560	4608560	and then you can click play on like a simulator and adjust the speed and what it does is
4608560	4614560	stimulates like injured people like particles blowing in wherever the like it's like when
4614560	4618560	you design cars and you just like have the air bouncing off the hood so that you can
4618560	4622560	design the car to be aerodynamic that they're just like you just you just you just have
4622560	4627560	like sick people pouring in through a through a through a dispenser and then they're just
4627560	4632560	like if they start hitting collecting in a corner you're like well that's a so it's like
4632560	4639560	so it's like health care tycoon. Yeah yeah yeah. But is there any element that's like
4639560	4648560	that? No. Okay. Well and have you noticed that people keep getting sick so maybe. Do
4648560	4653560	you get as specific as the artwork in the clinics? Oh yeah. Because what is it what
4653560	4658560	is the fascination with like cotshells? Aqua. There's lots of there's lots of sea foam
4658560	4663560	and aquas and yeah lots of moths in there. Yeah I think like well we try to change it
4663560	4670560	we try to spice it up maybe add in like a yellow. Ooh southwest zest. Yeah a little
4670560	4674560	ranch. Yeah but it's not ever like really up to us people are like no we want it to be
4674560	4680560	mint green and light pink that just says you're definitely sick. Let me know if you're in
4680560	4686560	real trouble Mrs. Jonathan. You know what? Yeah yeah yeah if we if we put bright colors
4686560	4691240	in the wall that means you're fine. You don't want to create an environment so unhospital
4691240	4696200	like that people are like I should get out of bed and they're like ripping. It's a beautiful
4696200	4701720	day out. I'm at a Burger King I want to I want to go play on the ball pit. No ma'am
4701720	4713320	you're you have leukemia. I do. Look at the walls. Oh. But I want to well not to but like
4713320	4718920	because I remember I wonder how much of that like because I'm assuming that there's a client
4718920	4722680	then that goes like yeah we wanted to take a chance and then you're like how about a splash
4722680	4727120	of yellow and they're like yeah but it doesn't feel hospital-y and it's like but if there's
4727120	4732000	that which is like a momentum of like a legacy of like let's like with talk shows it's like
4732000	4735800	oh but he doesn't have a desk and it's like then a desk becomes a desk becomes a desk
4735800	4740200	and somebody tries a talk show where it's like I'm just gonna sit on a flagpole and
4740200	4743920	do my talk show I'm because I'm crazy and then everyone's like yeah but you're not behind
4743920	4749920	a desk and it's like a syndrome versus like people going like oh there's been a study
4749920	4757640	that the color mint makes you like willing to be cut open. Yeah but does it have to go
4757640	4761240	both ways then I mean does it because people work there too and do you want them to feel
4761240	4767680	sick? No we actually do. Like we try to make it feel like a home because it's like been
4767760	4771960	proven that if you feel like you're at a home and you're being well taken care of then you
4771960	4776200	get well faster and we're trying to have more windows because if you can see nature you get
4776200	4783400	well faster. Whoa see that's the kind of fucking juice we wanted. Yeah so we do like give us that
4783400	4789240	sweet healthcare designer juice. Yeah so we'll do like rehab for like eating disorders but you want
4789240	4793360	it to feel like you just walked into like your friend's home and you can go like eat their dinner
4793360	4797560	because you have to eat when you go there so we try to make it like welcoming and everybody I
4797600	4802880	mean all this stuff it's like behavioral health so you need to go in and feel like you're not in an
4802880	4806400	institution like you don't want to go to an insane asylum because you want to kill like because you
4806400	4811280	want to commit suicide you want to go somewhere like we know life's life's really hard but like
4811280	4816680	sit in a super comfortable bright teal chair and like talk to me about it. Right but also if you
4816680	4822080	try to leave we'll tackle you. Yeah but all the doors are locked. Right do you have to have for
4822080	4826600	your line of work do you have to have like a psychological background would you study any
4826600	4831640	psychology? No I just studied interior design. Really? Yeah. And did you choose this or did it
4831640	4837000	kind of come fall into your lap or? It's sort of I mean healthcare happened on accident I did like
4837000	4843120	a senior thesis as a hospice which is a really weird senior thesis because nobody really wants
4843120	4847160	to like listen to you talk about how you read all these super depressing books about people
4847160	4852440	dying of cancer but in conclusion it ended up like getting me my job and I just did that because
4852440	4857800	like my mom was talking to me about this hospice that she was at and she's like it's really nice
4857800	4861440	like this place is great and I was like oh that sounds like a good senior thesis and our professor
4861440	4867200	told us that we should do things that are like nice for people and not just like a new restaurant
4867200	4872880	because then we seem like. Not like creepy professor Demorge who was only concerned with
4872880	4878960	your legs. It's starting to sound like healthcare design is the Christian rock of interior design.
4879880	4886520	A little bit. You're like well there's always a job there if you can create a you know because they
4886520	4898960	need help and Christians need rock too. Yeah. So then you're just like Jesus Christ. South Park did
4898960	4904200	it. What was that? There was something there was something I forgot I knew I should have written it
4904200	4911280	down. There was something when Middle Ditch was up here that and I fucking walk. There's no way you
4911280	4915840	guys are gonna remind me of what it was because it was in my own brain and I forgot it. Was it your
4915840	4923680	lips it? No of course it wasn't that. It's on his lip. So I'll never remember. What were you like
4923680	4928320	what would you want to stay doing this for a long time or yeah so that's what you would like. Yeah
4928320	4932680	this is like probably it's gonna be me for eternity. That's fantastic. Good for you. You actually went
4932680	4936760	to school studied a thing and found the niche that you wanted to be in. That's very cool. Yeah
4936760	4940560	yeah I originally went for like friends at chemistry and then I decided that I wasn't gonna
4940560	4944800	go to med school so the government could pay me salary to cut open some dead people. I was like
4944800	4953720	that's just way too much debt. I'll be an interior designer. You kids. So now you're creating the
4953720	4959840	environments where other people cut open dead people and are in debt. Yeah they do get into a
4959840	4965080	lot of debt. It's pretty much just comes full circle. Yeah I do feel bad for yeah well I've
4965080	4972160	already said this as millennials they really got fucked. The student debt thing is crazy. You're
4972160	4981280	welcome honey. I am old enough to be your dad and I do feel bad like about about about about about
4981280	4987760	student debt. That's all folks. It's fucking crazy. It's like a national epidemic. It's crazy. It's
4987760	4992800	like a scandal. It's like because it just kept going. When I was in high school it was happening
4992800	4997080	starting to happen while I was in high school. When I was in high school my friend Dave Friedel
4997080	5003840	like he was in like a food service like intern program. So even though he wasn't like the most
5003840	5009600	reliable like guy in terms of turning in his English homework and math and stuff he was staying
5009600	5013160	in high school. He was getting a decent grade point average because they had a program there
5013160	5018360	that was like for food service. It was like learning trade and like part of his high school
5018360	5024720	diploma was that he would go and work for a little bit at a restaurant and then and and because he had
5024720	5029080	that program he ended up being like he was fucking like he has he's had a great career. Now he's a
5029080	5033840	computer programmer but just that that professionalism but they were yanking those programs the whole
5033840	5038240	time just in those good like everything like everything that had anything to do with like a
5038240	5042280	middle you know it's like you're either gonna go to prison or you're gonna go to college is what
5042280	5047680	everything became and guess what college goes right to prison now lately because here's your
5047680	5053040	thank you for your debt and here's your math and by lately like there's no good so it's like turns
5053040	5057320	out yeah no you should be fucking teaching kids piano and you should be teaching them how to fix
5057320	5063040	cars and you should be teaching them how to peel a banana I don't know what you people do I don't
5063040	5069800	know what did you did you say stay in school motherfucker grade school oh trade school motherfucker
5070000	5076120	are there still trade schools I mean yeah those like kind of fucked up to that though technical
5076120	5082520	colleges and trade schools they don't get pushed by you know people who should be guiding youth yeah
5082520	5088560	I don't know I thought I remembered part of it Spencer did you go to college I forget oh yeah
5088560	5101800	what did you study what do you call it that bachelor's arts so the art of oh no no couch
5101800	5110440	in a turntable and associates arts advanced man cave so you man how many years of a higher
5110440	5117280	education did you get through more than you should to get an associate of arts degree that's two
5117680	5124720	I got a degree on accident did I tell you guys about this no my friend was graduating from
5124720	5130320	Moorpark college it's college I went to graduating from Moorpark college and I was I was invited so I
5130320	5134600	was sitting there waiting for him to walk and I was reading the program showing the list of the
5134600	5140680	recent graduates and I was like oh there I am I I must have filled out a form or something but I
5140720	5148880	just had no idea that I had done the degree that I wanted until I was at the graduation which would
5148880	5156320	have been my graduation if I was aware of that's the same as you like finding out about parties
5156320	5164320	that were on Facebook after the fact yeah that's my whole life oh this is always fun let's bring out
5164320	5177920	Steve Levy I think it's important to bring you out cuz I think probably stuff some people out

5584720	5594160	I drink a lot yeah yeah no really what's your spirit of choice uh I don't discriminate against
5594160	5600000	alcohol I think all of it's really worth it like last last night I was just hanging out with my
5600000	5605440	roommate we had wine tequila gin vodka and then we finished the night off with two different beers
5606640	5611200	yeah so high school that's the high school yeah except I had to pay a bunch of money for all of
5611200	5616080	it yeah like some guy that you like outside the 7-eleven and you're like can you buy us some
5616080	5625200	hey mister can I have a bottle of tequila what are you 12 uh all right Dan what would you
5625200	5632480	change about Steve Levy okay oh this is a better question well here he got his gums fixed uh yeah
5634320	5638400	you had a problem with his gums yeah yeah yeah this guy's well he got his way he was on Viking
5638480	5647120	and he had to have them fixed I mean everybody was talking about it called him crazy gums
5649760	5655120	crazy gums johnson I we knew his last name that's how that's how fucked up his gums for
5656320	5657520	I called him hubba bubba
5660880	5666880	because the gum makes sense tell me how to nickname people okay no really when I would
5666880	5672480	change it with Steve however but but but this is all under the umbrella of like I mean this is
5672480	5679200	like this is perfect this whole family that we have but it's pretty great but if I was the things
5679200	5685680	that I worry about with Steve that I would like him to be like I think Steve is uh is very uh
5687360	5691120	you're you're anxious about you know because you
5691120	5702000	I am I'm glad we solved that one he lost you can I say this you lost your dad at a young age
5702560	5708160	and you're kind of like you're very honest about this like you're very like like that like
5708160	5715200	threshold of like like you feel fragile you feel like life is fragile maybe that's I'm not putting
5715200	5720000	words in your mouth but like you you know you want people to make right choices and be healthy and
5720000	5725280	like that what that's what makes you a good like intrepid assistant so who would change anything
5725280	5729520	about that but I don't want you to go home at night and be unhappy because you think that
5729520	5736560	life is like so fucking dangerous because it's really just random you yeah no I think you you
5736560	5742320	hit the nail on the head right I'm fixed you right yes but it's not like a note you need to be given
5742320	5747440	you knew you you know you're stressed out a little bit like not stressed out it's not your personality
5748000	5754960	but no you're operating at a a cautious level yeah most of the time I think well
5756240	5762240	during last week's show my anxiety was a little bit through the roof because you were worried
5762240	5769280	that your dick was gonna come out well oh oh oh in new york yeah oh yeah because there was like
5769280	5774320	liquid and electricity everywhere yeah I thought my dick was out yeah yeah no that was there and
5774320	5779360	there had been a terrorist attack and there was squat teams everywhere yeah no yeah yeah no I
5779360	5784240	welcomed your nervous story for like a like a superhero or villain like his dick was out on
5784240	5790400	stage there was beer and vodka and Dan Harmon while insecure about not having an act becomes hack man
5792560	5797360	part prop part blackout oh andy dick
5798080	5806960	um uh I was never aware of the physical hazard that we were standing in I didn't realize it was
5806960	5811680	live current running you not how do you how do you not realize that you pour buckets on
5811680	5816640	dino's head or something I did I don't maybe know you're you were pouring
5818080	5823040	there was liquid everywhere yeah these things are it was a great show this meh
5823440	5828560	but boy oh boy that other show we've fallen into a middle ditch all right
5830160	5833120	all right let's turn this thing fucking let's take it to the fucking let's let's
5833120	5836240	let's take it to that thing where we like everybody's like I think I don't know
5836240	5839120	I don't know how many times that good and they're like yeah but did you see the thing
5839120	5844240	let's do one of those all right you ready yeah do the funk music funk music
5844240	5849440	yeah
5864240	5865440	good job I think we did it
5869840	5870640	it's that easy
5870640	5877760	it's sometimes that's all it takes I had a whole picture of my head of like these
5877760	5883200	worm people who were miners and they were going to work because it was like the wheel
5883200	5887760	but they were there it was and it was like a cross section that you could see them like walking
5890640	5895920	they got little helmets out of there show don't tell show don't tell them I'm doing it
5896160	5902720	whoa whoa whoa they're little yellow jackets and they're worms but they have eyes which is
5902720	5910080	dumb but they have a mining helmet on which is also dumb because and then we are the worm
5910080	5919280	miner people we we we do the mining for the world
5922800	5931200	well have you ever noticed that worms live in the ground did you think they did digging on
5931200	5940000	their own no there's an elite sector of worms that you never see that do their digging for them
5940000	5946640	my name is mr worm I'm the president of all worms I like to distribute the wealth
5946640	5956080	because I'm a socialist because I'm a worm and I say you get to be a miner and you are a regular
5956080	5963920	worm but in worm society miners are like the highest because it's a worm society
5964240	5971760	all we do is live in the ground it makes sense because if you do a one-for-one analog to human
5971760	5980320	society the elite are people who do what they lay in bed and read the paper and when worms
5980320	5985760	look at people that's what all we see is why are they doing that and you know how when it rains all
5985760	5990880	the worms come up all the worms come up and when it rains all those worms are coming up and they're
5990960	5994480	always going like where did the people go
6002880	6005520	worm society more complex than you think
6010000	6017280	mucus membranes protect us from the world our anatomy is a tube it's all that you have
6017280	6022960	glube your food as it goes through the hood of your body the clitoral hood comes out when you're
6022960	6028560	in the mood you're gonna eat eat eat and poop poop poop all you are is a torus shaped thing
6028560	6033760	that's like a sock that eats things nothing's changed we used to be cells and we used to
6033760	6038320	be have a range of little microns and we'd go up to a piece of food and we'd get on it and
6038320	6044160	we'd rub against it to eat and all these later times we've got mouths but all it really is is
6044160	6048640	that we're rubbing up against the food by putting it in our mouth because the inside of your
6048640	6055840	intestinal tract is the outside of your body i am just membrane because your butt hole connects
6055840	6060560	to your mouth and it's like a little spout but it goes straight through like a balloon if you go
6060560	6067920	like that your bloodstream needs to be shielded from the elementary canal if there's a rupture
6067920	6075840	you get septic just diseases like the little girl from poltergeist ladies and gentlemen
6076480	6084240	a pronouncement by president mr worm i pronounced the little girl from poltergeist a posthumous hero
6086800	6093840	she's a victim not of septic disease but of really of the entertainment industry's refusal
6093840	6101600	to stop making money poltergeist was such a smash hit that they refused to take her to proper
6101600	6107600	doctors and get her checked out i haven't researched this as much as a person blaming
6107600	6113360	an industry for someone's death should but i'm confident that there's enough things going on
6113360	6121600	in this news cycle that this won't blow up in my worm face plus who's gonna take me to task i'm
6121600	6129040	defending a little girl and i'm only attacking a system you know if i was like charlie sheen's a
6129040	6140320	jerk then oh boy oh the claxons would ring i smell clicks the primates would say but i'm just a worm
6140320	6145680	politician five seconds five what oh fuck your mama
6151600	6161760	no we didn't we took it to the fucking limit we took it to the limit of endurance nope
6163200	6166880	oh you think you could do better than that well maybe if we took it to the limit but uh
6166880	6172000	like uh uh peach cobbler takes it to the limit of the tiny square it's allotted in your tv dinner
6172800	6178640	all that means is it sits there where it's supposed to take it past the limit that's what
6178640	6184560	heroes do uh astronauts take it to the limit when they approach the atmosphere and burn up and fall
6184560	6193360	down excuse me what what are you what are you people ever sensitive about
6196080	6205280	you you are out of your goddamn hive mind you are the most reflexively sweaty fucking anxiety
6205280	6212560	driven homeschooled fucking insects your fucking generation is going to die
6214240	6222160	together all at once damn damn because you're not going to be able to fucking process damn damn

6244880	6246560	apologize to demorge
6249680	6250320	sounds fake
