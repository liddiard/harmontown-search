0	6000	Ladies and gentlemen, I'm your Comptroller Jeff Davis. Glad to be back in town.
6000	12000	It is November 5th, 2018 and Harman Town is now in session.
17000	23000	We're going to start things off in a slightly different fashion, a little bit of a departure from our normal intros.
23000	33000	Before I introduce your Game Master and your Mayor, let's please bring out the Solid Me Undies Dancer!
43000	44000	Yeah.
44000	52000	Your Game Master, Spencer Crittenden, everybody.
56000	59000	And the Mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harmon.
62000	63000	Thank you.
64000	73000	Me onesies. Me onesies. Me onesies. Me undies as onesies.
74000	80000	Head to toe, wearing me undies the way you know, but now the way you've never known them.
80000	86000	Me undies are growing from your shoulders to your dronem and your ankleem.
87000	94000	Soft as regular me undies, but covering your body, which raises questions.
97000	102000	I'm wearing an undershirt right now and regular me undies under the me onesies.
103000	113000	But if I wasn't wearing me undies underneath my me onesies, I have to wonder if I would just be rocking a constant,
114000	116000	agitated hard-on.
119000	121000	You're a stalking fetishist.
122000	126000	Well, look, everyone's a soft material dragged across your cock's fetishist.
128000	129000	Everyone.
129000	134000	I think we can cut the... I'm not going to segue into a rap about this.
135000	142000	Everyone's a having cloth draped across your croc, apologist. Not apologist, fetishist.
144000	150000	I'm not defensive about any of my fetishes. I'm just saying, for me to say...
150000	159000	Look, we all know that the me undies material is made from a material, a space age, but what is it called? A replenishable, what are you...
159000	162000	Completely sustainably sourced.
163000	165000	Space age fabric that's three times fat.
165000	167000	We're talking about micro modal.
167000	168000	Micro modal.
169000	173000	And I got excited about me socks.
173000	174000	Oh, yeah.
174000	176000	Turns out me socks are made of cotton.
177000	181000	It's three times less soft than micro modal.
181000	184000	I can see why they were hesitant. They never sent the me socks.
184000	188000	And meanwhile, I was worried like, well, what if the me socks are also three times softer than cotton?
188000	191000	Is this going to turn into an Ed Wood situation for me?
192000	197000	Because I'm a fan of women in comfortable fabrics.
199000	204000	What if I wanted to take a pawn myself there? What if I got a taste of it and was like, you know what?
205000	211000	What if this awakens something in me to paraphrase Dean Pelton from my hit show community?
213000	218000	But I'm draped head to toe in luxurious micro modal.
218000	226000	For the non-stream subscriber, Dan and Spencer are wearing what can only be described as hoodie to toe onesies right now.
227000	230000	This looks like Christmas morning at...
231000	233000	I assume these are called me onesies, right?
233000	234000	I hope so.
234000	236000	Did you coin that or is that what they're actually called?
236000	238000	I don't know. I don't know.
238000	239000	Probably.
239000	240000	Did I coin it?
240000	241000	I mean, yeah.
241000	242000	Great minds think alike.
242000	243000	Right, exactly.
243000	245000	I mean, they probably had a long time to think about it.
246000	249000	Anyways, they're a sponsor.
249000	251000	But look, I mean, we don't...
251000	257000	If Black and Decker sponsors the show, we're not going to come out here and drill things.
258000	259000	That would be amazing.
259000	261000	That sounds like fun, though. We should do that.
261000	263000	Well, maybe we would do it. Maybe that would be fun.
263000	264000	Because that sounds great.
264000	268000	But if it were worse, we wouldn't because we have integrity.
269000	272000	Spencer, are you wearing anything underneath your me onesie?
272000	274000	Oh, yeah. Clothes.
276000	279000	Do you have a full outfit underneath your me onesie?
279000	281000	I'm wearing a three-piece suit.
284000	287000	I have the feeling that you're actually not wearing anything under that me onesie.
287000	289000	No, no. It's legal.
292000	296000	I wonder about my nipples because I'm wearing an undershirt, which I don't know if I would or wouldn't.
296000	298000	I wonder about your nipples, too, Dan.
298000	299000	I think we all do.
299000	304000	What if I had micro-modal encasing my nipples?
304000	305000	It's not bad.
305000	307000	Every time I rolled over in bed, it was like sliding across it.
307000	308000	I don't know.
308000	310000	Why don't Spencer and I talk for a bit? You go backstage.
310000	311000	Oh, yeah.
311000	314000	Just robe and put your onesie on without anything on.
314000	315000	No, no.
316000	318000	No, that's not... No.
318000	319000	What are you afraid of?
322000	323000	I'm concerned about...
324000	325000	The show being bad.
327000	330000	I was about to say I'm worried about what they're afraid of,
330000	332000	but I don't want to go there because then you're going to go,
332000	334000	what are you afraid of, right, people?
334000	337000	And everyone's going to go, we're not afraid of anything.
338000	345000	I'm afraid of what is assault, whether they asked for it or not.
345000	346000	Okay, how about this?
346000	355000	I don't want them watching to see whether or not my little tiny fucking paneling nailcock starts to twitch.
356000	360000	There comes a point when entertainment is worth no ticket price.
360000	361000	What about this?
361000	365000	Leave your me undies under your me onesies on, but take the shirt off and see if...
365000	366000	Just the shirt.
366000	369000	Let's do a nipple experiment on your me onesies.
369000	370000	Just the nipple experiment.
370000	372000	Let's talk... There's just so much to talk about.
376000	379000	It's such a crucial time right now, guys.
379000	385000	By the time this actually drops as a podcast, the time will be over.
385000	391000	But right now, it's such an important time to let your voice be heard.
391000	398000	I'm talking about making sure that you leave a comment under a famous person's Instagram,
400000	405000	letting them know why you don't vote.
405000	411000	How dare Judd Apatow post a reminder that it's time to vote.
411000	414000	You don't let your voice be heard!
414000	418000	Explain to him why democracy doesn't work anymore.
418000	423000	He's asking for it, and more importantly, what if...
423000	426000	What if you didn't say anything?
426000	428000	Oh no.
428000	432000	Oh my God, the system would walk all over you.
432000	436000	Famous people would remind everyone to vote!
436000	441000	Everyone would vote, whether they wanted to or not, for whoever the fuck they wanted to.
441000	444000	You have to let freedom ring.
444000	455000	This is your one chance to lend your voice to an outcry without risking your voice actually becoming a part of anyone else's voice,
455000	459000	because this is about you, after all.
460000	464000	Please write a three-paragraph theme under everyone's Instagram.
464000	472000	How long, Alyssa Milano, must we live under the cruel tyranny of me following you on Instagram?
472000	477000	What do you mean, rock the vote, Sebastian Cabot?
480000	483000	Is he still... is his Instagram still alive?
484000	492000	I'm like, you know, everybody look, our culture has obviously become about, you know, as everybody knows.
492000	495000	Like, when I was in high school, we would have a thing in Milwaukee.
495000	500000	Like, standing in the parking lot of the McDonald's.
500000	507000	And Jerry's... or it's a stranger, it's probably a stranger, because otherwise you wouldn't do this.
507000	510000	But somebody's Camaro goes by and they go,
511000	513000	and they peel their tires.
513000	516000	And then what do you do in response to the tires peeling?
516000	520000	Regardless of how many people are around you and how much they value their eardrums,
520000	522000	this Camaro has committed a crime.
522000	527000	So now your duty, as a champion of the people and their peace and quiet, is to go,
527000	530000	oh, you're so cool!
531000	537000	And then probably, possibly, maybe someone who heard you do that could open their apartment window and go,
537000	540000	hey, some people have to work in the morning.
540000	544000	And then maybe someone who lives on the roof of that person's building could be like,
544000	547000	oh, it must be nice to have a job!
550000	561000	Says the pigeon master, the weird off-brand crow archetype who emerged with the spirit of pigeons
561000	564000	because he wasn't quite very wrongfully murdered.
568000	577000	It's endemic to our culture, social media has only exasperated this feeling that if you just let a day go by
577000	581000	without letting people know how fucking unique you are,
581000	586000	a landslide might happen of mediocrity, unremarkability.
586000	591000	You might get subsumed in just mayonnaise.
592000	594000	You'll wake up tomorrow and you'll be like,
594000	597000	I should have said something yesterday.
598000	604000	It's probably not true, I just, you know, I think if anything,
604000	608000	isn't it nice that the celebrities now are simply saying vote?
608000	612000	They're not saying, because they really do just want you to vote.
612000	618000	Here's a thought, spare a thought for some of these people that are reminding you to vote.
618000	623000	They maybe even know that you're not going to vote.
623000	634000	They're simply making one last fucking deal with whatever deity they worship that's like,
634000	638000	well, I gotta say something so I can sleep like a baby.
638000	641000	Remember Pontius Pilate? He was like, you know...
644000	651000	Nobody remembers Pontius Pilate harder than my personal trainer, Dave Cline.
652000	654000	It was really hard on him personally.
655000	658000	But he was surprised. He was like, I think I'm going to get it.
658000	662000	I'm just saying, when you watch it, it's possible that someone that says to you,
662000	665000	by the way, don't forget tomorrow's Waddle Awe Day,
665000	669000	that they, before you go, well, you know what?
669000	672000	You know what? Here's the thing about that.
672000	675000	I'm not going to do it because here's why.
676000	680000	You might be talking to the one person left who's still talking to you.
680000	684000	You might be shooting a messenger.
684000	687000	Actually, this is a segue into a...
687000	690000	Cody and I were watching a...
690000	693000	We were listening to a podcast about...
693000	696000	Oh, it was another horror podcast, some horror narrative.
696000	700000	And it's like, in a lot of these stories, people will...
700000	705000	They go through a ghost story and it'll resolve and...
705000	707000	What are you laughing at?
708000	712000	Don't tell me I'm not dressed the way...
713000	718000	I'm just saying, I don't know whether wearing jammies during a tirade helps or hurts.
718000	720000	It might...
720000	722000	It definitely is good.
722000	727000	We look like spokesmodels for a new kind of gumdrop from Europe, right?
727000	728000	Yeah.
729000	731000	Mooch and glubins.
731000	732000	Oh, man.
732000	735000	People like us are like, dude, give me some of them.
735000	736000	Mooch and glubins.
736000	743000	I think Miwanzi should come out with a gubernatorial brand of Miwanzi that has suspenders,
743000	746000	so you could tuck your thumbs into it.
746000	748000	What is with you millennials and hoods?
748000	750000	Oh, boy.
750000	754000	Why are you millennials so hood accepting?
754000	756000	They're good.
756000	757000	What's a...
757000	759000	Wear a hat, you jagoffs.
759000	762000	No one has ever done anything bad wearing a hood.
762000	767000	What did Generation X invest too much in peripheral vision and...
767000	770000	Fuck you, space children.
770000	771000	It's hard to...
771000	772000	You can't see on the...
772000	774000	What the hell's going on over there?
774000	776000	Some guy buying all the hats.
776000	777000	That's what's going on.
777000	778000	You fools.
778000	780000	You're too hood happy.
780000	784000	You're a bunch of hood drunk hologram kids.
784000	789000	Dan, keep your hood on, keep your hoodie on, and recite the Federalist Papers for us.
789000	791000	See how much water that holds.
791000	799000	We, the Federalists, that bring upon this paper the union of two governments,
799000	804000	the Federale and the Federolum, made the two...
804000	806000	Yeah, I can't even keep track of it.
806000	807000	You can't do it.
807000	808000	You can't do it, yeah.
808000	811000	You gotta wear a weird beaver top hat.
811000	815000	Anyways, oh, so we're listening to a ghost story on a podcast,
815000	820000	and ghost stories, they oftentimes will...
820000	825000	They'll be like a ghost, and then if it's...
825000	827000	And there'll be three acts, there'll be like a story.
827000	831000	And if it's gonna be like a happy ghost story, like, oh, and then we get rid of the ghost,
831000	835000	a lot of times it'll involve burning, burnt down the house,
835000	839000	and I got a can of gasoline that says, this is never gonna happen to anyone else.
839000	841000	And I'm always like, wait, you don't get that.
841000	845000	You don't have that in ghost writing, that you're not dooming a ghost
845000	850000	to haunt a charred pile of briquettes.
850000	852000	Well, ghosts are inherently flammable.
855000	858000	We all know that nobody's saying the ghost is gonna burn,
858000	862000	but I think there's an assumption in some of these stories that if you just burn down the house
862000	865000	where somebody got murdered or molested, that the ghost is gonna go finally.
865000	866000	Yeah, no.
866000	869000	Like I was attached to the wood, like a termite.
870000	871000	It's like, well, no.
871000	873000	I mean, how do we know it's not like GPS?
873000	875000	Like, that's the spot.
877000	882000	And if you burn the house down, you're actually dooming the ghost to like float around.
882000	887000	I was making that observation to Cody, and then Cody said, we were high.
889000	892000	And then Cody said, this isn't gonna be...
892000	894000	You guys are gonna take no delight in this, but I'm fucking...
894000	898000	Sometimes things make you so happy, you just gotta try to share them.
898000	903000	And then Cody said, well, maybe it's like a firehouse ghost.
904000	910000	And when she said that, I was like, oh, are you doing like a play on words?
910000	917000	Like, because you're evoking a famous phrase that I've never heard called a firehouse ghost?
918000	920000	And she's like, what? No.
920000	922000	I'm saying like, well, maybe it starts to haunt the firehouse.
922000	925000	And I'm like, wait, so a firehouse ghost isn't an idiom?
925000	929000	Like, it's not an expression, because it definitely should be.
930000	932000	And she's like, no, yeah, no.
932000	934000	I'm saying like, maybe it was like a firehouse ghost.
934000	940000	It just like leaps off the page as like an actual expression, especially right now.
940000	944000	A firehouse ghost, it's sort of related to shooting the messenger.
945000	947000	It's like, whoa, man, listen.
947000	953000	It's like if you're protesting together and you're like, fuck, we don't want Nazis to take over America.
954000	955000	Fuck that.
955000	959000	And then someone deters you and goes, like, excuse me, are your boots gluten free?
961000	964000	And you're like, fuck you, bitch.
964000	966000	Fuck, bitch, I don't beg your pardon.
966000	969000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys, you're haunting the firehouse.
972000	977000	You're frightening the only people that are available to frighten.
978000	983000	Nobody that we're trying to fight gives a fuck what you're talking about.
984000	989000	Get your signs back up in the air and stop being firehouse ghosts.
991000	994000	Anyways, well, I didn't mean to make the example political.
994000	996000	I just thought that it was a fun.
997000	1002000	I spent the last 45 seconds trying to think of a song by the band Firehouse and I couldn't think of any.
1003000	1007000	Man, you kind of you're kind of haunting the firehouse right now, man.
1007000	1010000	Like, who cares if he used the wrong pronoun?
1010000	1012000	Like, he's totally on your side.
1012000	1014000	Firehouses haunt themselves, bro.
1016000	1018000	Put the hose down, man.
1018000	1023000	I still like to imagine like firefighters like that's just the thing they have to deal with all the time.
1023000	1031000	They're like, look, I mean, if if if we were going to let firehouse ghosts like scare us out of the firehouse, we wouldn't be very good firemen.
1032000	1038000	Or is that a Ghostbusters reference because they the Ghostbusters work outside of a fire station, right?
1038000	1041000	Well, that's a dumb dot to connect.
1041000	1042000	Let's move on.
1042000	1043000	That's really smart.
1043000	1045000	You should be ashamed of yourself.
1045000	1047000	Oh, oh, I took it too far, huh?
1048000	1049000	I like it.
1049000	1050000	It's just a barrel.
1050000	1053000	Now they got a Ghostbusters and a couple of firehouse ghosts.
1054000	1057000	There was a movie where a firehouse was haunted.
1057000	1059000	Yeah, but it was a comedy in 1983.
1059000	1062000	It's not like just Jeff.
1067000	1074000	Let's if you think that you're wearing relaxed jammies around me, give you any sort of moral high ground.
1075000	1077000	I just feel more empowered.
1077000	1078000	I'm like, what are you, buddy?
1078000	1080000	What are you wearing a suit?
1080000	1081000	Yeah.
1081000	1082000	How much? Yeah.
1082000	1083000	What did you pay for it?
1083000	1084000	Don't even have to tell me your comfort.
1090000	1092000	I don't I make no compromises.
1092000	1094000	I'm cloaked in modal.
1094000	1100000	I'm talking to a guy who won't even wear his me onesie without wearing other clothes underneath it.
1100000	1101000	Oh, shit.
1101000	1104000	You can't even take off that shirt.
1104000	1106000	Get the nipple experiment.
1106000	1113000	You can't even have a party, a shower with a beautiful woman without taking your jeans off.
1114000	1116000	Yeah, that's a weird science reference, motherfucker.
1117000	1124000	Because Levy didn't bring me my phone, I'll take my shirt off while I grab my phone if you guys think you can handle.
1124000	1125000	I don't.
1126000	1127000	I don't think we can.
1127000	1135000	The reigns of Apollo's chariot for long enough that the Earth is not scorched and the seasons don't change.
1135000	1137000	I don't think we can do it.
1137000	1139000	I just think it's worth the risk.
1141000	1142000	Not even the risk.
1142000	1143000	It's worth the damage.
1143000	1144000	All right.
1145000	1149000	What Dan doesn't know is that we have background like backstage cameras.
1149000	1150000	Let's put those up on the big screen.
1150000	1153000	All right, Chris, go rough for five dollars a month.
1153000	1154000	You can watch Dan Harmon take his clothes.
1154000	1156000	Oh, look, there's this asshole.
1157000	1158000	Spencer, what's your stance on hoodies?
1158000	1160000	You have hoodie up right now.
1160000	1162000	I'm loving this.
1162000	1168000	I was saying that it reminds me of the Santa ornament I had at my house that was just like carved out of a wooden rod.
1168000	1171000	It just delights me that I look like a weird red druid.
1172000	1173000	Oh, no.
1175000	1176000	Oh.
1178000	1179000	Prove.
1180000	1182000	So so defiant.
1183000	1185000	Is it awakening something?
1185000	1187000	Came back on like James Coburn.
1187000	1196000	Well, I can't I can't I had to keep it on zip like like the sort of like a broken spirited porn actress that I've become.
1196000	1200000	I got like, see, I swallowed it.
1200000	1204000	Does that satisfy the fucking parameters of your porn site?
1206000	1210000	Can I get my fucking clothes on and go to Best Buy now?
1211000	1212000	Best Buy still exists.
1212000	1214000	I'm at Costco.
1214000	1215000	I can I can see.
1215000	1217000	I think I can see one of your nipples right now.
1217000	1218000	I think I can see one of them.
1218000	1220000	And they're probably getting super hard.
1221000	1223000	But this is an advertisement for me.
1223000	1230000	And these new me onesie because I'm telling you, you should be afraid of the comfort.
1230000	1231000	Comfort.
1231000	1232000	Yeah.
1232000	1233000	Comfort that will.
1233000	1234000	What are you doing?
1234000	1235000	Come on.
1235000	1238000	Now, this is that's not this is becoming problematic.
1238000	1239000	That's not.
1243000	1247000	His nipples are just fucking like the Eiffel Tower is on top of his chest.
1248000	1250000	That's going to happen in life.
1250000	1257000	They're normal nipples that may be extraordinarily excited by a fabric that is inordinately soft.
1260000	1265000	Do you think that's a plus or a minus for these like on your Yelp review of these things?
1265000	1267000	Are they too exciting for your nipples or?
1267000	1268000	No, not to.
1268000	1269000	That's what I'm saying.
1269000	1273000	It's an advertisement for I'm saying like, hey, man, you know, like you think of like
1274000	1279000	like they'll be up like a candy bar advertisement and they'll go like like, oh, careful.
1279000	1281000	It might taste so good that you get fired.
1281000	1288000	You know, yeah, it's like it's like, oh, these pajamas, these pajamas will make your dick explode.
1290000	1292000	Like people are going to order them.
1292000	1294000	They're like, well, let's find out.
1294000	1295000	I'll take that bet.
1295000	1296000	Yeah.
1296000	1299000	I didn't stop eating Cheetos when I found out they were dangerously cheesy.
1299000	1300000	Yeah.
1301000	1305000	Or like, you know, like old old movie, old horror movies that go like there's health insurance
1305000	1312000	available at the door in case you have a heart attack from, you know, a goblin coming out.
1313000	1314000	Yeah.
1314000	1315000	That makes sense.
1315000	1316000	It's good advertising.
1316000	1321000	Speaking of goblins, are you excited about this next season of Harmon Quest?
1321000	1322000	Oh, yeah.
1322000	1325000	You guys can come to taping if you want.
1325000	1326000	It's next week.
1326000	1327000	We're telling them.
1327000	1328000	Yeah, I am.
1328000	1329000	Dan and I are actually in the show.
1329000	1330000	You guys can come if you want to.
1330000	1331000	Okay, cool.
1331000	1332000	Yeah.
1333000	1334000	All right.
1334000	1337000	The only other two things that I had to talk about were this other thing.
1337000	1339000	And this is a thing.
1339000	1346000	Moving from true crime to horror podcasts, I have noticed the one thing that I've noticed
1346000	1353000	a human flaw in our culture, something that I think we're letting slide too much and not
1353000	1354000	questioning.
1354000	1358000	This concept that you can feel like someone's watching you.
1358000	1362000	I don't like it.
1362000	1366000	Even cops in true crime shows will be like, yeah, I went to the vacant lot.
1366000	1372000	And then I had that feeling, you know, like someone was watching.
1372000	1375000	Like, it's your professional police officer.
1375000	1379000	And then it's like you shouldn't be saying the same things that somebody's saying in
1379000	1386000	some crazy fucking kookamani story about an octopus monster in a garage.
1386000	1391000	Where did we get this idea that it's like totally kosher to be a person who doesn't
1391000	1396000	necessarily totally believe in the paranormal but we all can feel when someone's watching
1396000	1397000	us?
1397000	1398000	That's crazy.
1398000	1400000	That's Moon Man shit.
1400000	1402000	I'm not saying it's not possible.
1402000	1407000	I'm saying, like, you better fucking say I believe in goddamn psychic phenomenon then.
1407000	1413000	You can't just be like, well, I'm famous forensic psychologist so-and-so and then I got that
1413000	1414000	feeling, you know?
1414000	1416000	Like, you feel like someone's like watching you.
1416000	1417000	Like, what do you mean?
1417000	1418000	What do you, Spiderman?
1418000	1419000	You can't say that.
1419000	1424000	You're not allowed to say that and be a scientist or a police officer or anything.
1424000	1429000	What if like it's a human thing of you being like hypersensitive to the slightest movement,
1429000	1430000	the slightest sound?
1430000	1431000	That's not what it is.
1431000	1432000	That's why it's I don't.
1432000	1433000	The slightest sound.
1433000	1437000	Like Daredevil, like the hairs in the back of your neck are picking up on like someone's
1437000	1438000	breath.
1438000	1441000	That's called someone being so close to you that you can feel their breath.
1441000	1442000	That's not what I'm talking about.
1443000	1446000	I'm talking about people are like, oh, I felt like someone was watching me.
1446000	1447000	We just accept it.
1447000	1448000	We're too accepted of it.
1448000	1453000	When people say that, that should be the equivalent at least if a police officer on a true crime
1453000	1456000	show says, then they kind of got the feeling, you know, someone's watching me.
1456000	1459000	We should at least regard that as the same as him saying, like, you know, I knew I was
1459000	1464000	a Capricorn, so going in I had to bring extra bullets.
1464000	1470000	We should be like, I don't care how many bullets you bring, but don't base it on that.
1471000	1472000	Be careful.
1472000	1476000	You write, you write reports.
1476000	1479000	They can't be based on no planets.
1479000	1484000	They got to be based on the beat and the street.
1484000	1485000	All right.
1485000	1486000	Me.
1486000	1490000	You know, I've been doing this long enough.
1490000	1495000	I feel like your pajamas, your pajamas are giving you too much of a sense of latitude
1495000	1496000	right now.
1496000	1498000	Latitude, latitude.
1498000	1500000	He thinks I've got.
1500000	1501000	Oh, boy.
1501000	1503000	If he can stand where I'm standing.
1503000	1509000	I feel like I've got to hunch over just to avoid the ceiling fan with these people.
1512000	1516000	I know where I stand with you folks, and I'm fine with it.
1516000	1519000	That's why I always bring interesting guests.
1519000	1521000	We talk about things, you know.
1521000	1525000	I throw them to the sharks.
1525000	1529000	I say this in the most loving way possible, the way your father said it to you a thousand
1529000	1530000	times.
1530000	1533000	I've had it with you.
1533000	1539000	And I say as your babysitter often said, I don't care what you think.
1539000	1547000	And as your mother said maybe a few times, like, you're not mine.
1547000	1549000	There's no actual connection here.
1549000	1555000	It was a legal, semi-financial transaction in the back alley.
1555000	1559000	This sounds like the lead up to the best intro to a guest of all time.
1559000	1563000	So don't even think for a second you have power over my confidence.
1568000	1571000	Shut up, you sycophantic prick.
1571000	1577000	See, I can't tell if your onesie is making you more confident or more vulnerable.
1578000	1581000	Maybe I started drinking at work early.
1583000	1585000	You don't know me.
1585000	1587000	You don't know nothing about me.
1592000	1598000	Maybe after a year I finally signed a contract that makes me unfireable.
1607000	1609000	That seems like a safe, bees-hive detention.
1609000	1611000	Oh sure, no, yeah.
1611000	1614000	Oh Dan, Dan, that seems safe to talk about.
1614000	1617000	Hey Dan, oh that seems a good thing to say.
1617000	1619000	Oh Dan, that seems like a good idea.
1619000	1621000	Oh Dan, keep talking about that.
1621000	1623000	Hey Dan, pick your battles.
1623000	1625000	Hey Dan, keep talking.
1625000	1626000	Oh dig a little deeper.
1626000	1628000	Too much information.
1628000	1630000	Oh I wouldn't say what you're saying right now.
1630000	1632000	A meep, meep, meep, meep.
1632000	1634000	Fuck off, I hate it.
1634000	1636000	I can't stand this life anymore.
1638000	1641000	I'm 45 years.
1641000	1643000	I spent doing one thing right.
1643000	1644000	I was honest.
1644000	1646000	That's all I ever did.
1646000	1649000	Just let me fucking tell you how my day went.
1649000	1654000	Stop fucking pretending that there's a way I'm going to get through this life unscathed.
1654000	1656000	It's not going to happen.
1656000	1660000	The only way to do it wrong is to be afraid of these fucking people.
1660000	1663000	Let's bring out our socialist friend.
1667000	1674000	It was the best intro.
1674000	1676000	It's our favorite socialist.
1676000	1678000	Josh Androski is here.
1688000	1691000	Yeah, measure me.
1691000	1695000	What's up?
1695000	1697000	That was real.
1697000	1698000	That rule.
1698000	1700000	Well I felt real but I didn't really say anything.
1700000	1704000	I think what I'm saying is if I feel like saying anything in the future I may say it.
1704000	1706000	But I didn't really say anything.
1706000	1708000	You're saying that you might say something.
1708000	1710000	Yeah, I'm declaring an intention to say.
1710000	1712000	It's a promise ring of saying.
1712000	1713000	Yeah, it doesn't really mean a lot.
1713000	1715000	Hell yeah, but it means something to you.
1715000	1716000	It could be good.
1716000	1720000	You're like the Elon Musk of saying things.
1720000	1726000	Well, I mean look, I know he over promised his delivery of poor people's Teslas.
1726000	1728000	Is that what you're referring to?
1728000	1730000	No, he's a great man and he's my best friend.
1730000	1732000	Leave him alone.
1732000	1742000	He's Willy Wonka, but if an evil, awful, awful, horrible, union busting child man with pork skin.
1742000	1744000	You guys are all jealous.
1744000	1747000	He was a child of Gem Barons.
1747000	1751000	If Ruby's in his pocket growing up, this is true.
1751000	1753000	We love Ruby's.
1753000	1754000	Those are good things.
1754000	1755000	They're beautiful.
1755000	1757000	They look great.
1757000	1759000	And his family keeps him from the rest of us.
1759000	1764000	You find him in chests.
1764000	1768000	Well, let's make you the Elon Musk of socialism.
1768000	1770000	Let's even the score a little bit.
1770000	1772000	Equal time.
1772000	1775000	Right, Elon will be responding to all of your points.
1776000	1778000	I would love that.
1778000	1782000	How have you been since the last time we saw you, which is a long time ago, probably too long.
1782000	1784000	I've been really good. Thank you.
1784000	1786000	Do you want some liquor?
1786000	1789000	Do we give it according to need?
1789000	1793000	You're looking extra Marx-y right now.
1793000	1797000	It's like Slumber Party Marx.
1797000	1800000	Well, I probably look like Slumber Party Hitler too though, right?
1800000	1802000	I mean, I look like Slumber Party anybody.
1802000	1804000	No, not with that beard.
1804000	1806000	You have to get rid of most of your facial hair.
1806000	1810000	Oh, you were talking about you saying since I last saw you, my beard maybe got bushier.
1810000	1813000	Well, less Hitler-like, certainly.
1813000	1815000	Interesting that Hitler had a beard.
1815000	1817000	I think he would have been way cooler.
1817000	1819000	For God's sake.
1819000	1821000	It says a lot about you that you're like,
1821000	1825000	I'm going to have one little fucking square of hair on my face and that's it.
1825000	1826000	Yeah.
1826000	1831000	That's the worst thing he ever did.
1831000	1833000	I've been good.
1833000	1835000	I'm among his biggest crimes, facial hair.
1835000	1836000	Yes, thank you.
1836000	1839000	I do wonder about that mustache because obviously the thing we know,
1839000	1842000	a lot of American thing that comes to mind is Chaplin,
1842000	1846000	so we know there must have been some fucking thing that people did back then.
1846000	1847000	Gas masks.
1847000	1850000	In World War I, you couldn't have a long, wide mustache
1850000	1853000	because it would break the seal on the gas mask and the trenches.
1853000	1854000	Right.
1854000	1856000	The fashion for short mustaches became a thing
1856000	1858000	where you could seal the gas mask around your mouth.
1858000	1860000	That seems very...
1860000	1862000	Cool.
1862000	1865000	That seems very logical, but it seems like the kind of logic
1865000	1867000	that ultimately is like...
1867000	1870000	It's like when people go, you know the word fuck stands for
1870000	1873000	use of carnal knowledge and they used to tattoo it on witches.
1873000	1877000	I'm like, that rings logical, but it also doesn't ring with the kind of
1877000	1881000	organic truth that most true things turn out to have.
1881000	1883000	It almost sounds a little overwrought.
1883000	1885000	It doesn't explain why Michael Jordan had a Hitler mustache
1885000	1887000	in the Haynes commercials.
1887000	1891000	Unless he was going ham on that gas mask bong.
1892000	1894000	Oh shit.
1894000	1896000	Name a better reason.
1896000	1897000	Yeah, all right.
1897000	1900000	Do we believe of mankind, for instance,
1900000	1902000	and in this case I truly mean mankind,
1902000	1909000	that mustache fashion would acquiesce to gas maskery
1909000	1911000	in functionality while still...
1911000	1914000	Would people be that insistent on a mustache?
1914000	1917000	That they would be like, well, there's got to be some mustache there.
1917000	1920000	That was also a mustache style pre-World War I,
1920000	1923000	but that became a more functional mustache.
1923000	1924000	Oh, okay.
1924000	1926000	All right, so it gained a popularity because...
1926000	1928000	It gained functionality.
1928000	1930000	Like if you were a fighter...
1930000	1932000	It gained popularity because of the functionality.
1932000	1935000	So you keep pretending that you're correcting me.
1935000	1936000	We're talking about the same thing.
1936000	1938000	You fucking son of a bitch.
1938000	1940000	Oh, you're haunting the firehouse, bro.
1940000	1941000	But we're...
1941000	1943000	Oh no.
1945000	1947000	God damn it.
1948000	1951000	Josh, I was saving that one for later in the show.
1951000	1952000	You fucking...
1952000	1953000	I'm so sorry.
1953000	1955000	You loved it right up.
1955000	1957000	That's a big mistake to save it, I think.
1957000	1959000	That's like a cookie on a...
1959000	1961000	I mean, not to undermine your use of it.
1961000	1962000	Thank you.
1962000	1963000	He did it perfectly.
1963000	1965000	But it was pretty easy.
1965000	1967000	But I'm saying...
1967000	1970000	I don't want to harp on this, but I have these questions.
1970000	1973000	They're also answerable through Wikipedia, probably.
1973000	1974000	But what do you type in?
1974000	1976000	Hitler mustache?
1976000	1978000	The chaplain?
1978000	1980000	It's like, what is that fucking stripe?
1980000	1985000	Now we have this insight that maybe it got signal boosted as a mustache.
1985000	1988000	Whereas because it was gas mask compatible.
1988000	1990000	Please retweet this mustache.
1990000	1992000	Please, signal boost.
1992000	1994000	But at some point still, people are like, you know,
1994000	1996000	God knows why any mustache, whatever.
1996000	1999000	I mean, we all know from playing role-playing games,
1999000	2002000	video games, that there's a million kinds of mustache.
2002000	2003000	Hell yeah.
2003000	2006000	How do any of them gain any kind of favor?
2006000	2012000	Also, going to any bar or restaurant in Silver Lake.
2012000	2016000	So we got to send Malcolm Gladwell to squirrel
2016000	2021000	to discover how mustaches, like, sociologically get better.
2021000	2023000	Josh, is there any...
2023000	2026000	What has happened since we saw you last, maybe in your...
2026000	2029000	Take it personally or politically.
2029000	2031000	I don't know, take it anywhere you want to.
2031000	2039000	So I'll take it politically, because that's what I've been sort of...
2039000	2045000	So I guess I should say first that I won a million dollars on a slot machine.
2045000	2047000	Oh, right.
2047000	2051000	Yeah, I won a million dollars on a Big Bang Theory slot machine.
2051000	2053000	Bazinga.
2053000	2057000	That's a real thing that happened to me.
2057000	2059000	I think that was something that we didn't talk about,
2060000	2063000	because you didn't then give it all away, which would undermine your...
2063000	2065000	I gave half of it away.
2065000	2068000	I did, and Elon Musk could fucking take that to the bank.
2068000	2073000	You won a million dollars on a Big Bang Theory slot machine
2073000	2075000	and gave half of it away.
2075000	2077000	To friends and family in various organizations,
2077000	2079000	because nobody should hoard that much well.
2079000	2082000	And how much did they sock it to you for luxury tax on that?
2082000	2084000	Oh boy, way more than...
2084000	2086000	That's got to be like half, right?
2086000	2090000	Yeah, and then the slot machine corporation cuts off a chunk for them.
2090000	2092000	They got to have a taste.
2092000	2096000	I don't know why, but they cut off like six figures.
2096000	2097000	They have a taste.
2097000	2098000	Shut up, not really.
2098000	2099000	No, for real.
2099000	2100000	No, shut up.
2100000	2101000	I swear to God.
2101000	2103000	Well, we made the machine that made the money.
2103000	2108000	Yes, which is how Elon Musk gets rich.
2108000	2113000	You think it's cheap to get Chuck Lorre to agree to put Big Bang Theory's face on this machine?
2113000	2114000	It didn't go to Chuck.
2114000	2115000	I checked.
2115000	2116000	I can talk to him right now.
2116000	2118000	I can talk to him.
2118000	2123000	No, they said that what we promised you was the annuity.
2123000	2129000	So you get like $50,000 for X amount of years.
2129000	2133000	And it ended up being until I was like 55 or 60 or something.
2133000	2137000	And I was like, there's not going to be a Nevada then.
2137000	2139000	Like, give me all of it right now.
2139000	2142000	And they're like, all right, well, we got to cut off six figures for ourselves.
2142000	2144000	And that's the deal.
2144000	2145000	Oh.
2145000	2146000	What the fuck?
2146000	2147000	To get the lump sum.
2147000	2148000	That is such a fucking fuck fuck.
2148000	2149000	That's how they do it.
2149000	2150000	I know.
2150000	2151000	Don't you feel so bad for me?
2151000	2157500	Also, well, we do because they should because a million fucking dollars should come out
2157500	2158500	of the thing.
2158500	2164940	And knowing that that can't happen, that the fucking check that comes out should be you
2164940	2170280	should be able to take it to a giant phone bank and like, yes, the ghost of Ed McMahon
2170280	2171280	is there.
2171280	2172280	It sucks.
2172280	2176760	But it's also uplifting, actually, to learn that like if you do win like a bunch of money
2176760	2184560	in a contest that actually it is is it's it's like basically like as cool as getting a massive
2184560	2189640	unearned promotion at your dishwashing job, like and that it and that it only like actually
2189640	2191680	like that there's like four every year.
2191680	2192680	Yeah.
2192680	2193680	Yeah.
2193680	2194680	Yeah.
2194680	2195680	That would be cool.
2195680	2196680	So Josh, I have a question.
2196680	2197680	Yes.
2197680	2199280	I have friends that have won much smaller amounts, but still big amounts of money like
2199280	2200280	on slots.
2200280	2204200	Did they guilt you into tipping them really largely?
2204200	2205200	Oh, they didn't have to.
2205200	2208200	That was the first fucking thing I was like, give me all this money.
2208200	2211920	I just want to walk around and give people a hundred dollar bills because like, how often
2211920	2218360	do you get to radically confront your own value system, right?
2218360	2223240	Like I am I am a self-proclaimed card carrying socialist.
2223240	2229960	So it was like, all right, I have to literally put my money where my mouth is now.
2229960	2234720	So like that part of it that was like could have been a Larry David, like, what did you
2234720	2235720	do to deserve?
2235720	2237720	I was like, what did I do to deserve this?
2237720	2241120	So I was just like, I'm the money man.
2241120	2244520	I wanted to get a suit with question marks all over it.
2244520	2249480	Like free money from me.
2249480	2254480	I'm assuming after all of all of those takeaways and all that stuff that you still ended up
2254480	2258680	six figures up at some yeah, under 500,000.
2258680	2263560	I just got for being a dude and now was this a high stakes game you're playing?
2263560	2264560	Were you playing?
2264560	2265640	No, it was a penny slot.
2265640	2266640	My man.
2266640	2270200	No, you're on like, I'm hung up on something else.
2270200	2271960	You know, that suit has dollar signs on it.
2271960	2272960	Not question marks.
2272960	2273960	The question.
2273960	2277880	If it was question marks, it would be the joker, the riddler, the riddler.
2277880	2278880	Sorry.
2278880	2280960	I had the exclamation points of the dollar.
2280960	2283240	The guy you're the real estate guy.
2283240	2286040	He looks like the riddler, but he has dollar signs, right?
2286040	2287200	Matthew Lesko is his name.
2287200	2291560	I know that from being super stoned and watching the first person that that referred to goes
2291560	2292560	like, oh, I got a question.
2292560	2293560	Right.
2293560	2297360	And then it's like, God, if I created the riddler, I'd be so mad.
2297360	2298360	Wait.
2298360	2299360	Really?
2299360	2300360	Yeah.
2300360	2301360	Vindicated.
2301360	2302760	He can't do that.
2302760	2303760	No, you can't.
2303760	2304760	No, you can't.
2304760	2306400	You're probably fine with him doing that.
2306400	2307400	I'm mad.
2307400	2308400	intellectual property.
2308400	2314400	That could be money out of my pocket if I was in the different.
2314400	2315400	Yeah, you're right.
2315400	2316400	No, he's got a question.
2316400	2317400	Sorry.
2317400	2320800	Then I'm a double villain for cutting off this conversation.
2320800	2323160	No, I'm happy that we proved me right.
2323160	2324160	That rules.
2324160	2325160	I love it.
2325160	2327560	But I also have to go back to the Rick and Morty writers room because this is actually
2327560	2332800	a running joke in the room that we and the butt of the joke is someone who we thought
2332800	2337760	misappropriated the it doesn't matter.
2337760	2338760	But I did.
2338760	2339760	Wait, did you have an elaborate joke?
2339760	2342560	I have to send three text messages when I get off stage and eat a lot of shit.
2342560	2343560	Hell yeah.
2343560	2347240	I have an elaborate joke premise that just came true before your very eyes came false.
2347240	2348240	I think.
2348240	2349240	No, no, no.
2349240	2351160	It's it's it's that we had a we had an in joke.
2351160	2354800	We had somebody we were having a conversation that somehow touched on that guy.
2354800	2355800	Right.
2355800	2360840	And then the person who described him as having question marks all over his suit was mocked,
2360840	2366320	ridiculed, tarred, feathered because we all none of us looked it up on the Internet and
2366320	2373360	all of us all of us agreed just from our understanding of fucking property in IP law.
2373360	2374360	Right.
2374360	2376080	That there's no way that must have been dollar signs.
2376080	2377080	Fuck you.
2377080	2378400	How could you confuse him for the Riddler?
2378400	2381040	You idiot.
2381040	2385840	And I need to buy that person a dog or something now.
2385840	2390120	That's a fair barter and like their own their own dog.
2390120	2391120	All right.
2391120	2393800	So, Josh, you're you're in a casino.
2393800	2394800	You're in Vegas.
2394800	2395800	Right.
2395800	2400240	And you're you're you're a card carrying socialist.
2400240	2401240	You bet.
2401240	2408040	And what is the the impetus to sit down and play slots as as a socialist because I'm going
2408040	2413520	to steal this money from the from the system and appropriate it to the to the masses.
2413520	2418400	It's the only honest form of capitalism is the only honest industry in capitalism is
2418400	2424080	gambling because everybody knows you're going to get fucked like when you enter into it.
2424080	2425880	You're like, yes, we're going to fuck you.
2425880	2426880	And you're like, cool.
2426880	2429080	I'd love a lime orita.
2429080	2430200	And right.
2430200	2432520	And then you read drinks while you're doing it.
2432520	2433520	Right.
2433520	2438080	And the idea is that the lottery is like I wouldn't be surprised if like in a socialist
2438080	2442800	society or an anarchist society, even depending on the type of anarchy that the lotteries
2442800	2448000	would happen given that they often use them to fund schools and stuff.
2448000	2449000	Right.
2449000	2450000	Well, I mean, I don't know.
2450000	2452920	There's like fascist lotteries like the Shirley Jackson one.
2452920	2454080	You've got to stay away from those.
2454080	2455920	Oh, no, that could be good, though.
2455920	2460760	Do you think I mean, I'm not a conspiracy guy, but do you think that people like at
2460760	2463280	the casino go, OK, we've got a real socialist coming.
2463280	2466640	I mean, look at him and he's got a dress like my guy.
2466640	2467960	He goes on podcasts.
2467960	2469640	He's got a platform.
2469640	2474120	Let's make this socialist rich casino capitalist money.
2474120	2475120	Guess what he's going to do?
2475120	2480080	Go on on all these podcasts and talk about what was the casino?
2480080	2481080	The El Cortez.
2481440	2486000	Yeah, now everyone's going to go to the El Cortez.
2486000	2492400	But, you know, they could be really good for us if you wanted at the Meundi's casino.
2492400	2493480	You know, you see what I'm doing here?
2493480	2494480	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2494480	2495480	Yeah.
2495480	2501080	The messaging between socialism and casinos have the not incompatible messaging.
2501080	2508280	Both billboards say, hey, poor wishing you weren't come to a place that everyone like
2508280	2509280	you comes.
2509280	2510280	Right.
2510600	2515080	In socialism, when it's done as like written, as you're supposed to do it, no one's
2515080	2516680	supposed to win a jackpot.
2516680	2522320	Well, but also nobody's supposed to go bust, you know, it would be like everybody ties
2522320	2524960	and then sometimes you win and that's cool, too.
2524960	2526840	Right. They don't put that on the billboards, though.
2526840	2528000	They don't they don't they don't go.
2528000	2531800	You might not go broke and end up sucking dick for crack.
2532800	2534480	Yeah, I mean, you're not gonna.
2534480	2537040	Yeah, that's a promise.
2537040	2538680	You still can.
2538680	2543360	Yeah. What if you can provide dick sucking and you need coke?
2545960	2547200	Right.
2547200	2548200	That's how it works.
2548200	2549320	That's communism.
2549320	2550960	That's bartering, my man.
2550960	2551880	That's that's it.
2551880	2554280	That's the new economy.
2554280	2556760	That's what Marx called seizing the means of production.
2556760	2559160	It's according to my needs.
2559160	2563040	We're slipping into this trope, though, where we do we always do this in political
2563040	2568600	conversation, where we tend to we we I'm going to make up a new phrase in my
2568600	2573440	drunkenness. We hyper rise every every ideology, because what we want to do is
2573440	2577040	we want to do this, you know, we want to go like, well, the socialist grabbing
2577040	2580920	some potato chips, I see how come, you know, it's like when the reality,
2580920	2587080	I would say is, come on, we've we've we've succeeded as a nation
2587600	2592600	by blending the right ideologies and the right ratios.
2592600	2598480	And we fail when we get tempted by, you know, to somebody grabs the conscience
2598480	2602840	like we need to fucking step on the faces of everyone who thinks that they're
2602840	2605720	entitled to a fucking dollar that someone else made.
2605720	2610560	And it's like that, that is the that's that's one gas pedal that can get
2610560	2613040	pressed that fucks things up for everybody in the long term.
2613080	2616760	And maybe arguably another gas pedal, though I don't know in the history of this
2616760	2620880	country, we've ever pressed it so hard that we've been threatened is I think a lot
2620880	2626440	of people would say we we have but like that the opposite idea is also a terrible
2626440	2630400	idea, like the idea that, hey, everybody, come over here instead.
2630640	2631720	Don't don't.
2631720	2634520	Well, if you're feeling weak, just follow your instincts
2634520	2636520	and line up and hang out.
2636520	2637640	We got your back.
2637640	2640400	And that's the fear is that that's going to.
2640720	2642760	Oh, where are our Alex P.
2642760	2646880	Keaton's like who among us will remember how to be savage?
2647480	2650000	Right. Yeah, they're bored with an ale in it.
2650040	2652320	Like, yeah, we all learned in history class that it's good.
2652320	2655320	Come on. We go through the fucking shit happens.
2655320	2657280	Like oil plummets through the floor.
2657280	2662240	Like nations go into crisis and then presidents rise up and say,
2662240	2665800	everyone's got to get a job or you're going to do this for free.
2665800	2668840	Is it like like like these moments of historical inspiration
2668840	2672760	where we blend these concepts and then we have these words that excite people?
2673240	2678200	Socialism, communism, you know, like it it it's come on.
2678200	2682640	We we we we have so much socialism in our country right now.
2682640	2684800	Yeah, it works for everybody. Yeah. Yeah.
2684800	2688720	Like the the trash people and like all these things,
2688720	2691200	like municipal services, taxes.
2691200	2693440	Yeah. Well, the police.
2693440	2696320	I mean, those are the those are not great ones.
2696920	2698880	Libraries, fire department.
2698880	2699880	Those ones are better.
2699880	2702280	The police that we have are better than the good police.
2702280	2704240	Better than a privatized police force.
2704240	2705440	Yes. Garbage.
2705440	2707280	The garbage service is better.
2707280	2709160	You know, like we have approved it.
2709160	2712200	People the the the hardest core conservative
2712200	2714560	is not going to start arguing with you
2714560	2719280	that he thinks that 12 garbage trucks should show up and argue with each other
2719280	2721440	about who gets to take his garbage away from his house.
2721440	2724400	He just wants his fucking garbage taken away, et cetera. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
2724400	2727960	And well, actually, to talk about what I'm working on right now,
2727960	2732080	because I have all this free time now, I've devoted like it all to something
2732080	2734320	called Measure B.
2734320	2735520	You've definitely heard of it.
2735520	2737800	How many other people have heard of Measure B?
2738720	2742200	OK, that's cool. It's it is a very small campaign.
2742200	2744480	There's only a few of us working on it right now.
2744480	2749080	But essentially what it does is you were talking about privatization, basically.
2749080	2753120	Right. Like the idea of like, oh, yeah, let's just let people
2753120	2756360	whose motive is to make as much money as possible
2756600	2759840	decide things that matter in people's lives. Right.
2760200	2762720	And the things that are ostensibly sorry to derail you for it,
2762720	2766840	but the things that are ostensibly foundational to the pursuit of happiness.
2766840	2769160	Right. Education, medicine. Right.
2769160	2770760	That's where we get into these debates. Yeah.
2770760	2771600	Like, well, wait a minute.
2771600	2773440	Is it part of being an American to
2775520	2777920	if you cut off your thumb, be able to get it reattached?
2777920	2780560	Or is it is that something that only Mr.
2780560	2782920	Howell on Gilligan's Island can have and Ginger can't?
2782920	2784840	Because he hasn't made enough coconuts yet.
2784840	2787880	Yeah. And I was a TV show in the 1970s.
2791760	2793480	Mr. Howell is rich.
2793480	2795280	So Gilligan did stuff for him.
2795280	2798800	It didn't make a lot of sense because Ginger was a movie star.
2798960	2801400	I guess she just didn't bring enough money in her suitcase.
2802960	2803560	Don't you think Mr.
2803560	2806000	Halligan was like, I'm good for it. Lovey.
2806000	2807120	Yeah. All right. Continue. Sorry.
2807120	2809000	She could have used Measure B.
2810600	2812840	But education may be slotting into that.
2812840	2813880	So so well, yeah.
2813880	2817720	So well, another thing that slots into that is finance is money is just.
2817720	2821320	I think I think we talked about this one of the last times you were on
2821320	2824760	is like the financing of the government that the banks are involved in.
2824800	2828120	So this is the credit union versus essentially.
2828160	2831000	So it's the idea of like a for profit bank versus a public bank.
2831000	2833400	Measure B would be the first step towards a public bank.
2833400	2834800	You get a groan from that guy.
2834800	2836520	I thought that was a gasp.
2836520	2837760	Oh, it might be. I don't know.
2837760	2841560	He just he got it. He let out a bunch of he's like, oh, deflated.
2843800	2848000	So basically what happens now is when you go and buy an ice cream cone,
2848280	2851240	the city puts your tax dollars in a private bank
2851240	2855600	and that private bank uses your tax money to finance investments in
2856360	2861120	oil pipelines, in guns, in cigarettes,
2861680	2865160	private prisons, including the very cages that separate
2865160	2868520	undocumented children from their families desecrating native lands.
2868520	2870320	Oh, absolutely. They love doing that.
2870320	2872120	They can't get enough of it.
2872120	2875400	Guys, if all this happened every time I bought an ice cream cone,
2876240	2878200	the planet would be over.
2878200	2880200	Oh, but it is.
2880840	2884360	But and also the government needs to get financing
2884360	2886920	from banks to do governmental stuff.
2886920	2890360	Yeah, like building a park and the banks can say, hey,
2890520	2893080	we're not going to let you build this park and give you the money
2893080	2896120	unless you make burning children legal.
2896360	2901320	And so like we're like, or they charge like, you know, a much higher interest
2901320	2904440	like on, you know, student loans and on credit card loans.
2904440	2907400	Like you understand, like interest payments are fucked
2907400	2909200	and it's just extracting.
2909200	2912440	It's the labor from literally blackmailing the government.
2912560	2915440	Yes, because they realize they had the power to do so.
2915440	2919360	And since that happened, we've dealt with like these horrible problems
2919760	2924960	coming from money, not being in line with what the public needs for a society.
2924960	2928240	Right. And it plays into economic crises. Right. Right.
2928720	2932800	Because banks and this is kind of shocking, they can just straight up
2932800	2935600	lend out like 90 percent of their deposits
2936400	2940480	to anything that they want, which is a pretty obvious flaw
2940480	2944560	right staring at you in the system that everybody just agrees is fine.
2945600	2949360	That you can lend out 90 percent of the money you have.
2949360	2953360	Like if I. Yeah, look into it. Yeah. OK.
2953360	2958000	There's the SDIC is is hopefully trying to help, you know,
2958000	2962400	banks not come into problems where they end in where they don't have the money
2962400	2965120	to when there's like a massive run on the banks. Right.
2965120	2966800	But you know, it goes so far.
2966800	2970320	The FDIC is just taxpayers bailing out people. Right.
2970320	2974960	So every time, basically, we finance all of this gambling
2974960	2980640	that these total like translucent sideways blinking millionaire dudes in New York.
2980640	2983680	These are not my real beliefs. I'm just exaggerating for community.
2983680	2987440	They're real. I'm not going to like make a hard left turn and like everyone's a lizard.
2989040	2991920	Only an elite class of super lizards that rule from above.
2992080	2995200	But it was a lizard. The lizard agenda would be undermined.
2995200	2998880	Some fucking asshole that was born into a specific family that makes them a billionaire
2998880	3001360	is profiting off of the literal worst things in the world.
3001360	3004080	And we are subsidizing our own extinction.
3004080	3008320	Measure B is the first step to stop that because instead it would not extract all
3008320	3010480	this money from the Los Angeles economy.
3010480	3014640	It would keep it in the Los Angeles economy and invest it specifically
3014640	3019040	in things that we deem are good. Right. And so right now,
3019040	3023840	City Hall is like really taking our lead, which is fucking weird.
3025280	3028160	Everybody wants it. Doesn't the police union want it?
3028160	3029120	Yeah, everybody.
3029120	3032240	It's kind of important for California, right? Because we basically as a state,
3032240	3038320	correct me if I'm wrong, California, it kind of like there's a lot of back and forth where it's
3038320	3042400	like we give the landlord this much and the landlord owes us this much and blah, blah, blah.
3042400	3043120	Right.
3043120	3047920	We're basically at this point in time unless I'm wrong, it kind of all comes out even,
3047920	3053920	meaning that now more than ever, California has that sort of power to be like, you know what?
3053920	3057360	Yes. Yeah. California is not in as much debt as it was like 10 years ago.
3057360	3062080	And right now is the exact time because of that sort of economic leverage
3062080	3064800	for Californian cities to start doing this kind of thing.
3065760	3072880	Basically, what happens now is it's about $1.1 billion a year that we owe to banks
3073760	3076640	for the privilege of propping up their horrible industries and letting them
3077440	3081760	profit off of this. We owe them $1.3 billion a year.
3081760	3084240	Those are service charges and wasted money.
3084240	3088400	Yeah, interest and fees and shit like that. Right now, this is a fucking insane thing,
3088400	3094000	but you're like, oh, it's 2018. That makes sense. 50% of all infrastructure money in
3094000	3100000	California right now goes directly to a banker's pocket. That's like way too much percent.
3100640	3101520	That's yeah.
3101520	3102240	You know what I mean?
3102240	3103600	That's 50% too much.
3103680	3110320	We should probably, we're on a good roll here. We've got the audience's attention, of course.
3110320	3110880	They love it.
3113840	3121440	I'm a ringmaster. My profit relies on me keeping these people locked into my addiction to my
3121440	3127280	content. Some of them might be going, hey, Dan, what are you doing? Would you just feed me a
3127280	3133200	bunch of numbers and a bunch of stuff? Here's the thing, though. We're going to wrap it.
3133840	3137920	We're going to disguise it in a little entertainment. We're going to do a little,
3138720	3144080	I'm going to be a glip glop, the bank.
3146640	3147600	I'm listening.
3150640	3153760	I need you to do more than listen because I need your help really badly.
3154560	3155760	I don't know how to-
3155760	3156720	So you're a bank.
3156720	3160880	Well, I want to make this, I want to wrap this in a narrative and make it entertaining.
3161520	3162800	Provide you with a platform.
3163040	3167360	You can be like, I don't want to spoil it, but I foresee you going like, hey,
3167360	3173360	glip glop, you can't take 21% of that or whatever. We put it on a spoon with some
3173360	3174880	gumdrops on it and we fucking like-
3174880	3177840	Dan, Dan, you're topping from the bottom right now.
3177840	3181680	And what if there's a fun character called MCB?
3182800	3183280	MCB?
3183280	3184320	Like for Measure B.
3185280	3188400	All right, Measure B. Yeah, MCB could be the spokesperson.
3188400	3188900	Right.
3189760	3191120	Of glip glop, the bank.
3191120	3193040	He's the spokesperson of the situation.
3193040	3193920	Well, glip glop's the bank.
3193920	3196640	Now, glip glop's probably a bad person because he's a bank, right?
3196640	3199280	Oh, okay. So MCB is our Greek chorus.
3199280	3200480	Right, more or less.
3200480	3200880	Okay.
3200880	3205360	Because you guys are having a bad situation and he shows you that there's a better way.
3206320	3206960	Measure B.
3208160	3209280	All right, all right, all right.
3209280	3211920	So I'm like a customer and I'm upset with the bank.
3211920	3213440	Can my name be Josh still?
3213440	3214320	Or does it have to be like-
3214320	3215040	Yeah, of course.
3215040	3215840	Twag will-
3215840	3216480	I don't know.
3216480	3218080	No, Josh is great.
3218080	3218400	Okay.
3218960	3219920	But I'm glip glop.
3221200	3221920	That's fair.
3221920	3222880	I'm the bank.
3222880	3223200	Okay.
3223200	3223840	Okay.
3223840	3225120	Now I want to be someone else.
3225120	3225680	Well, no, be-
3226480	3230320	Can I be Antonio Banderas?
3230320	3230480	Yeah.
3231440	3232160	Okay.
3232160	3236240	You're actually the second person in a month to want that.
3237440	3238880	That seems like way too few.
3238880	3240320	That's amazing.
3240320	3240960	He rules.
3242960	3248880	Omar Camacho just expressed a desire to be him a few weeks ago.
3248880	3253840	All right, well, yeah, so are we doing a scene and then it'll turn into like
3253840	3256560	kind of a Hamilton type musical about financial-
3257840	3258880	I think so, yeah, yeah.
3258880	3261200	Financial power.
3261200	3261520	Okay.
3261520	3262240	Sure.
3262240	3263520	So I'll set the scene.
3265040	3265920	You haven't come in yet.
3269120	3270400	The original bankster.
3270400	3271520	Dave, you're-
3271520	3274640	By the way, I think that's my trainer that called out the usury thing and I think-
3274640	3275360	He's on your side.
3275360	3275840	Look it up.
3275840	3276720	Look up usury.
3276720	3279520	I know when people yell things out, the primate instinct is like,
3279520	3281440	shit, somebody wants to fucking kill me.
3282400	3283840	What is he training you to do?
3285120	3286160	Commit usury.
3287200	3289120	If you have to ask, nothing.
3291600	3292960	Okay, I thought I was some sort of emotional trainer.
3292960	3296560	You should have been like, holy shit, I was going to ask what happens.
3296560	3297440	Oh, you look great.
3298160	3299120	Zach, are you up there?
3300320	3303040	Is Zach McKeever up there in case we need beats for this Hamilton musical?
3304080	3304480	All right.
3304480	3305920	He says, sure.
3305920	3306400	Okay.
3306400	3310160	I assume the first song would be like me setting up my bank because-
3310160	3310640	Sure.
3310640	3311840	And, you know-
3311840	3312560	All right, Zach.
3312560	3315360	Zach, I want you to DJ this Hamiltonian musical.
3315360	3317120	We want to like Glipglop.
3317120	3320560	Well, we want to accept him.
3320560	3321200	Right.
3321200	3322000	Sorry, that's what I mean.
3322000	3324720	Well, maybe if we'll go changes from a private bank to a public bank,
3324720	3326480	then we can accept Glipglop.
3326480	3327200	Oh.
3327200	3327840	Right.
3327840	3329200	Oh, he'll be a...
3329200	3330080	Okay, good.
3330080	3330720	I like that.
3330720	3331200	Oh, boy.
3331200	3333360	It's kind of like Book of Mormon, I assume.
3334480	3335280	It's exactly, yeah.
3336080	3336560	Sure.
3336560	3337280	I'll start as a...
3337280	3339200	Well, why don't you be a...
3339200	3340240	Don't be a customer then.
3341200	3342000	I'll be a villain.
3343120	3345760	Why are you telling Antonio Banderas what to be in the scene?
3345760	3348960	You'd be an employee of the bank.
3348960	3350800	Okay, and I'm bringing the-
3350800	3352160	This is your first day of work.
3352160	3353680	Okay, and I'm like, whoa, this is all...
3353680	3354480	Okay, cool, cool, cool.
3354480	3356960	Because that's more like Book of Mormon and that's a hit.
3356960	3357200	Okay.
3358480	3358960	All right.
3360160	3362320	This is going to be as good as Book of Mormon.
3362320	3362560	Yeah.
3363440	3365120	It's going to make people vote for stuff too.
3365280	3365840	Okay.
3368560	3369040	Yo.
3369920	3372480	Oh, flip-flop.
3374640	3375600	Oh, bank.
3376240	3377440	Bank into America.
3378000	3379760	Oh, yeah.
3381760	3383040	Here come the finance.
3384000	3384720	Ha.
3384720	3384960	Yo.
3385920	3387040	Flip the sign.
3387040	3388400	Open for business.
3388400	3389120	Business.
3389120	3390000	Coast to coast.
3390000	3391120	I got the most.
3391120	3392560	All of the money comes through me.
3392560	3393520	Like I was toast.
3393520	3396160	It's brown on the edges and white in the middle,
3396160	3399360	but everybody dances to this bank's fiddle.
3399360	3400240	Welcome aboard.
3400240	3401520	It's your first day of work.
3402240	3403200	Be a pro.
3403200	3404240	Don't be a jerk.
3404240	3405600	Let me show you the ropes.
3405600	3407120	Let me show you how it goes.
3407120	3409760	I'll show you how to handle all the ladies in the bros
3409760	3412080	and the non-binary customers.
3413520	3415280	That's a growing demographic.
3415280	3416480	Disposable income.
3417520	3420160	They can get any job they want.
3424480	3425440	Ah.
3425440	3428720	Well, I'm Pantonio Banderas and I'm here to say
3428720	3431120	I'm at work for my very first day.
3431920	3434640	Is my accent good or is my accent bad?
3434640	3435200	It's great.
3435200	3436080	It's good.
3436080	3436720	Thank you.
3436720	3437600	That's rad.
3441840	3444080	But you know it is not this bank.
3444640	3446320	It's all covered in snot.
3446320	3446960	Morally.
3449200	3451520	I feel like it's set up horribly.
3453680	3454400	What do you mean?
3454400	3455680	Don't you like a job?
3455680	3458160	Why are you coming in here like a socialist stop?
3458160	3461360	The bank works the way it works for the dollar.
3461360	3463680	Yo, if you don't like it, holler.
3467600	3468320	At your girl.
3469120	3472400	Your girl being Hillary.
3472400	3472800	I don't know.
3474400	3477040	The thing about you that you do not understand
3477040	3479520	is that you are a bank and I am a man.
3480480	3483120	I see what lies before me.
3483120	3484320	Just sorrow.
3484320	3485680	And I'm kind of horny.
3487840	3488880	But for justice.
3490560	3494800	And what I want is for you to give more of your profits
3494800	3498880	to little kids so they can grow up in a world that's true
3498880	3501200	and not sunk underneath the ocean blue.
3506240	3507920	Okay, that'll be it.
3508160	3510640	Okay, because, yeah, we don't want it.
3513520	3516880	Certainly must say I've never spoken to a new employee
3516880	3519120	with your brand of Spitfire.
3520240	3522400	You never before hired an employee
3522400	3523920	with my brand of Spitfire.
3526800	3527280	Ting.
3529520	3532080	If we weren't making more money by,
3532720	3536000	through our Latinx outreach tax subsidy,
3536960	3539280	than we would by firing you,
3539280	3541440	I don't have to tell you what I do.
3541440	3544080	However, it just so happens
3544080	3546880	I need a man like you in my office.
3548880	3549440	Whoa.
3549440	3552320	Like, permanently or just temporarily
3552320	3554240	as we talk in a place that isn't right here
3554240	3555120	on the banking floor?
3555120	3556720	To speak to, yes.
3557840	3562640	Because there's things I need to read you into, as they say.
3562640	3565520	I will happily join you in your office,
3565520	3567200	which I assume we are walking through now,
3567200	3568080	as I am saying.
3568080	3568580	Yes.
3569520	3570080	I like-
3570080	3570560	I glide.
3572640	3576960	Because it's Broadway, so the walls are going up on strings
3576960	3579280	and the new walls are coming down on strings.
3579280	3580560	I'll learn the terminology.
3582800	3585440	I think we could use a man like you
3585440	3587200	at our upcoming conference.
3587200	3590400	We're sending a few candidates out to Florida
3590400	3592960	for a global banking initiative.
3595680	3596880	Oh, that sounds wonderful.
3596880	3597920	Florida.
3597920	3599440	I love Florida.
3599440	3603200	I love tan, middle-aged white women.
3604560	3605600	And jello.
3606560	3607120	Shots.
3608800	3611360	Yes, well, just keep representing us
3611360	3613200	the way we like to be represented
3613200	3614960	so we don't lose our subsidy,
3614960	3616880	and you'll keep your job.
3616880	3618960	And there may be a promotion for you,
3618960	3620560	but do me a favor.
3620560	3623520	Put a clamp on all this commie talk
3623600	3625920	you were spewing when you came in.
3625920	3627760	But what if I told you
3627760	3630800	that in doing some of these commie things,
3630800	3632720	we, this bank here,
3632720	3634720	could keep more money
3634720	3637120	instead of putting it away into other places?
3638240	3640240	Keeping more money is called profit,
3640240	3641840	and I'm sure we figured out
3641840	3643680	how to turn one of those by now.
3645760	3647280	You would think so.
3647280	3649680	Ah, will he ever understand?
3654160	3654640	Beat.
3663680	3665200	Well, I'm Vittorio Van Der Esen,
3665200	3666320	I'm here to say
3666320	3668320	there's still Vittorio Van Der Esen every way.
3670240	3672480	Just had to remind you that up front.
3672480	3673520	Here's the thing.
3673520	3674000	I'm gone.
3674000	3674400	You're doing it.
3674400	3675600	I thought you were doing like a solo.
3675600	3676880	Yes, of course.
3676880	3678000	This is all in my head.
3678800	3680400	This is you explaining to the audience
3680400	3682720	how you feel so that they're on your side.
3682800	3685600	So don't hog my moment in the spotlight.
3685600	3686880	It feels so right.
3686880	3687680	Right here.
3687680	3688800	Between you and me.
3689360	3689840	Just me.
3690880	3691840	Just him.
3693040	3693600	Just me.
3694160	3694640	Just him.
3695280	3697440	Between you and me and just me,
3697440	3699600	there should be life and liberty
3699600	3702480	and not banks that just create poverty.
3702480	3703840	But that's just between you and me.
3704880	3706240	Just him.
3706240	3706740	Me.
3709200	3709840	And him.
3710640	3711360	Boy, oh boy,
3711360	3712800	I didn't think I would rap.
3712800	3715440	Honestly, I'm surprised it's not crap.
3715440	3717680	Here's the thing that I want you to hear.
3717680	3720320	Vote for measure B or I'll cut off my ear.
3721360	3722160	Oh, shit.
3727200	3728800	Oh, no, my hearing's going.
3731200	3735600	It's the sound of an airplane landing in Florida.
3735600	3736320	Oh, yes.
3736320	3737840	Because we're crossing a threshold.
3739280	3740080	Cut the music.
3742240	3745120	Oh, no, you're in Florida, but your ears hurt.
3747280	3751200	Florida, moderately priced beverages everywhere.
3752000	3753440	Fast casual dining.
3753440	3754080	Excuse me.
3754080	3755120	Please get out of my way.
3755120	3755760	I can't with you.
3755760	3757360	Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry.
3758160	3760160	Let me help you pick up these files
3760160	3762160	for the banking conference.
3764080	3767040	Oh, I'm sure to be late now and get fired.
3767040	3767920	Wait a minute.
3767920	3770080	I'm worried about being fired
3770160	3773360	for other reasons at this very banking conference.
3773360	3775120	Maybe you and I are very alike.
3776240	3779280	Since we're both obviously going to take different cabs,
3779280	3780480	we're both going to be late.
3781280	3782240	Wait, wait.
3782240	3784720	But what if we took one cab together?
3785600	3787280	This one right here.
3787280	3787760	Wow.
3787760	3789680	What a deus ex machina.
3789680	3790160	Hello.
3791040	3791440	Hello.
3791440	3794640	Do you guys want to get into my taxi cab?
3795760	3797440	For some reason, I am a Frenchman.
3798400	3801680	Oh, he doesn't seem sure about his accent either.
3801680	3802640	I trust him.
3804800	3807040	Has anyone told you, sir, that you sound a little bit
3807040	3808800	like Ren from Ren and Stimpy?
3810880	3813360	Yes, every day of my life.
3814320	3818320	Well, I have no choice but to share this cab,
3818320	3822000	but it runs counter to everything my parents taught me
3822000	3823120	about how to use.
3823120	3824240	Madam, you have every choice.
3824240	3825920	You do not have to get into any cab,
3825920	3827280	but you do not want to get into it.
3827600	3828400	Just wait.
3828400	3830800	Look at me now and understand that, yes,
3830800	3834800	if we competed individually, maybe you would get a cab
3834800	3837360	faster than hearing me give this emotional speech.
3838080	3841920	But if we work together and share the cab,
3842880	3846240	like two people who share maybe a planet
3846240	3847680	and that planet's resources,
3848240	3851120	maybe we'd get there on time and not get fired,
3851120	3852160	but prosper.
3852160	3859680	I'll do it right now and think about it later.
3860720	3863280	That's great, person whose name I don't know yet.
3863280	3864240	It's Wendy.
3865040	3865680	Wendy.
3866800	3868320	Wait, did you say Wendy or Wendy?
3868960	3869680	Wendy.
3869680	3870080	Okay, sorry.
3870080	3871040	Go back into your thing.
3871040	3871920	I'm sorry I interrupted.
3871920	3874960	My name is Wendy.
3875680	3876080	Wendy.
3881120	3882160	Hear me blow.
3886160	3886880	Forever.
3888800	3890880	I often know what others know.
3895760	3897440	It's the winds of change.
3900400	3902400	For me, it's the winds of fear.
3902640	3905680	I'll blow those winds away.
3907680	3908320	Oh, they're going.
3908320	3909120	They're going away now.
3910080	3915360	If only I had your confidence and your wisdom, Antonio.
3916080	3919600	If only I could think twice before I speak.
3922160	3926800	If only I had your long black locks and piercing eyes.
3928000	3931520	If only I had your body and yours mind to keep.
3933200	3953520	Why don't we share them in a collective of body parts and qualities so we can both draw upon them with.
3953520	3954640	Oh, is that a cab?
3955440	3956320	Are you open?
3956320	3956960	Hey, we're changing.
3956960	3957920	No, that's ours, sir.
3957920	3958240	Thank you.
3959040	3959520	Let's get it.
3959520	3960080	Let's get it.
3960080	3960960	Let's get in the cab.
3960960	3970240	I'm taking you to the economic conference, I understand, right?
3970240	3971600	Yes, this is the Holiday Inn.
3971600	3972320	Yes, please.
3973600	3976560	We're going to be big people in the banking world one day.
3976560	3976720	All right.
3976720	3978960	Well, actually, it was next door to the airport.
3978960	3980560	You didn't even have to get into my cab.
3981600	3982560	Didn't we, though?
3983120	3983520	You know what?
3983520	3987760	I don't even want to accept any money from you because it feels like the love that you
3987760	3992080	have provided the world is enough to sustain the whole community.
3992080	3992720	Oh, gosh.
3993360	3994640	What is it about you?
3994640	4000160	Ever since I met you, it's like goods are being exchanged for services with no standardized currency.
4002080	4003840	People tell me that all the time.
4006880	4008480	Hey, Wendy.
4009040	4009760	Antonio.
4010720	4016720	Why don't we, if you mind, if you are enthusiastically consenting,
4018320	4019360	hold my hand.
4020720	4023680	I know we did it already, but I'm asking again to prove that I am a gentleman.
4023680	4023920	Okay.
4024960	4031600	And why don't we walk together into a new world of sharing, banking, and our hearts?
4032720	4034880	Well, we got to go to the conference, right?
4034880	4037520	Yeah, I meant metaphorically, but literally, yes.
4037520	4040560	I mean, let's walk directly into that Holiday Inn Express.
4040560	4043760	If you're asking, can we sit together at the seminar, of course.
4043760	4044960	Oh, cool.
4044960	4046640	I guess I have some abandonment issues.
4046640	4049520	So I didn't really read that right.
4049520	4050560	Screech!
4050560	4052080	Hello, this is me again, the cab driver.
4052080	4054960	Oh, I overheard you saying you want to go into the seminar?
4054960	4055360	Yes.
4055360	4058720	You have to go all the way around the back of the convention center.
4058720	4061360	Hop back into the cab and I'll take you there right now.
4061360	4062320	Okay.
4062320	4063280	It'll be on the house.
4063280	4065600	It'll be mutual reciprocity.
4065600	4071680	It is not based on capitalism or any sort of agreed upon finance.
4071680	4074800	It's just the fact that you have made me smile and I will give you a free ride
4074880	4076880	around the back of the seminar.
4077520	4079680	Thank you so much for explaining that to us.
4081200	4081920	Let's do it.
4081920	4084560	I just want to be totally on the table about this.
4085440	4086160	Absolutely.
4086160	4086640	All right.
4086640	4087120	Antonio.
4087120	4088480	Let's get back into the car.
4088480	4090400	I had abandonment issues once too.
4091120	4092000	Really?
4092000	4093760	Can I give you some advice?
4093760	4094080	Sure.
4096080	4097120	Abandon them.
4099200	4103680	Abandon those issues of abandonment.
4103680	4108000	I'm going to leave them behind.
4108000	4111840	I promise you let them be afraid.
4112640	4116160	I will to be left alone.
4116160	4118240	I will do that.
4122000	4126240	Well, being here right now in the place where we first met outside of this cab
4126240	4128720	makes me know that I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
4130480	4133360	Will you share your life with me?
4134400	4135040	Oh.
4135040	4139760	I'm afraid to abandon him, but I'm also afraid to be abandoned.
4140880	4143200	But I'm not afraid to abandon those fears.
4143840	4144400	I do.
4145200	4145680	Yes!
4146320	4147680	She said yes!
4149440	4150320	Oh, no.
4152400	4154400	Let's skip the whole banking conference.
4154400	4155840	There's nothing they can teach us.
4155840	4159840	Let's open our own bank based on Cyclone B.
4159840	4160880	What's the thing called?
4160880	4161680	Cyclone B.
4161680	4162320	Oh, boy.
4162320	4163120	Oh, boy.
4163120	4166640	No, it's a very common misunderstanding.
4166640	4168640	As the cab driver, I overheard that.
4168640	4170880	It is certainly not Cyclone B.
4170880	4172800	Oh, yes, on Cyclone B.
4172800	4175360	That's a gas that was used in concentration camps.
4175360	4176160	Okay, all right.
4177440	4180880	I don't know why out of all the B things with that coming to my...
4180880	4182960	Because you're feeling so many things right now.
4182960	4183760	We're getting married.
4183760	4185040	It's because I'm from Wyoming.
4185040	4185920	Yes, of course.
4187440	4190640	You get targeted Facebook ads that say only people who are from Wyoming
4190640	4192480	that compare things to Cyclone B would like this.
4192480	4194800	I saw men that looked like you were gonna kill me.
4194800	4195360	Oh, yes.
4195360	4196480	No, that's your fear.
4196480	4199360	And you're going to abandon that fear.
4200240	4202400	Leave it behind.
4202400	4205040	And come ever more near.
4207680	4220240	We're going to get married and form a form.
4221040	4235760	Form a good part in being.
4241280	4241920	Good show, man.
4241920	4242640	Good show.
4242640	4243760	Hey, great show, man.
4243760	4244240	Oh, no.
4244240	4245040	Super great.
4245040	4246320	Oh, great show, man.
4246320	4247120	Okay, fine.
4247120	4248400	Yeah, I guess if they want us to.
4248400	4250080	One more time for Michael Flatley, everybody.
4250160	4250880	Michael Flatley.
4256320	4257120	Well, I mean, it's...
4258320	4260880	So that's what a public bank is.
4261760	4264000	I mean, nothing bad happened to them.
4264000	4265200	They just met and fell in love.
4266640	4268000	Yeah, some stories are small.
4270560	4270880	All right.
4270880	4271360	Well, I don't want to...
4271360	4274240	But if you guys got into my cab, I was going to abduct you both and take...
4274240	4275600	That's what it was seeming like.
4275600	4276960	Yeah, there was going to be an action.
4276960	4277680	It was a trick.
4277680	4278960	I can feel that tension.
4279440	4282400	Yeah, I was going to find out that you were a traitor to the bank.
4284800	4286480	He's a double agent working for the thing.
4286480	4289120	And it was very...
4289120	4289840	Well, he's been...
4289840	4293600	You know, Jeff spends a lot of the time that he should be here doing this show
4293600	4295440	out on the road with professional improvisers.
4295440	4299360	So he knew where he was going and we didn't.
4300080	4301760	No, but you guys are falling in love and singing.
4301760	4302400	And there's no way I would...
4302400	4303360	I thought they would laugh at that.
4303360	4304320	I didn't know what people would be like.
4304320	4304880	Ooh, burn.
4306240	4306960	It was a joke.
4306960	4309680	Guys, I thought it would be funny.
4309680	4311040	Ooh, improv slam.
4311040	4313040	I'm not upset.
4313040	4315200	I thought it would be a funny joke.
4316720	4320240	But I think maybe some of the people are resentful of you for being so absent lately.
4320240	4320720	Yeah.
4322160	4323120	Or maybe they're racist.
4323120	4324080	They hate Brandon.
4324080	4324720	I don't know.
4328560	4330000	Only your vote will decide.
4331840	4333280	The B is for Brandon.
4334640	4335280	Sometimes.
4335680	4336640	Oh, shit.
4337280	4338400	That's Measure B?
4338400	4338880	Yeah.
4338880	4339840	Measure B is Brandon.
4339840	4341040	I thought it was Ben Derris.
4341040	4342480	I also thought...
4342480	4343520	Oh, that should have come up.
4343520	4344560	You are good at improv.
4350160	4351440	Measure B is...
4352560	4354160	Okay, now forgive my ignorance.
4355760	4357600	So do you know what a public bank is yet?
4358960	4359840	Let's start there.
4360720	4361920	But is Measure B...
4362400	4363760	Is it a...
4363760	4365520	It's not a legal referendum.
4365520	4367120	It's not something that's up for vote.
4367120	4368000	It is up for vote.
4368000	4368480	It is.
4368480	4375120	Yeah, so it's a very small change to the city's charter that makes it legal to create a public bank.
4375120	4378480	It is currently illegal to make a public bank.
4379120	4381360	And the change would make it legal.
4381360	4382880	Oh, so simple, right?
4382880	4383520	Yeah, basically.
4383520	4384320	Very simple.
4384320	4385520	Too simple, in fact.
4385520	4389840	It's like saying, hey, porn stars don't have to wear condoms.
4390640	4391520	Sorry, bad example.
4392320	4393200	I mean, they don't.
4393200	4396880	But it is true when we had our friend Riley Reid up here, even though that's...
4396880	4400560	It's easy to cloak something in the guise of like, we're just trying to keep people safe.
4400560	4401040	No.
4401040	4402480	But you can also be like...
4402480	4404560	It's like, oh, fuck, oppression and stuff.
4404560	4408560	It's not like porn stars are saying, we want to be unsafe.
4408560	4409920	It's more like, keep this...
4409920	4410480	Yeah, so...
4410480	4412560	If everyone has socialized medicine, you check all the time.
4412560	4415680	It's a really dumb parallel for me to draw.
4415680	4416560	It's really stupid.
4417200	4419040	I think it was the same measure, though.
4419040	4419600	Well, I think it was.
4419600	4420720	I literally think it was the same measure.
4420800	4422160	Yeah, measure B, the condom law.
4422160	4423440	I think it was the same letter.
4423440	4426400	And it was pushed by the guy who's pushing Proposition 10.
4426400	4430240	Yeah, really wild, because Prop 10 is great and that fucking sucked.
4430240	4430480	Yeah.
4431280	4432160	But he saw the light.
4432160	4434320	There were a bunch of activists that basically were like, yo,
4434880	4438400	Prop 10 is good because rent control is tight and people shouldn't...
4438400	4443040	Landlords shouldn't be able to jack up prices when people move out.
4443040	4446640	Like, they shouldn't be able to do vacancy bullshit and like,
4446640	4450400	jack up the rent however much they want and keep people out of the neighborhood.
4450480	4451920	Is there a lot of...
4451920	4453280	So, yes on 10 also.
4453280	4454240	Yeah, yes on 10.
4455520	4456240	Sorry, I didn't even...
4456240	4458640	I was thinking about my next thing that I wanted to ask.
4458640	4459520	That's good.
4459520	4460320	But that's fine.
4460320	4461680	I'm sure measured...
4461680	4462480	But is there...
4462480	4463440	What I wanted to ask is...
4463440	4464080	Because we're...
4464080	4467040	Like, if you even go to a bar and you aren't on Twitter like me,
4467760	4468800	like, I'm still...
4468800	4472320	I'm like, right now, being flooded with imagery that's like,
4472320	4475520	Proposition this and referendum that and all this stuff.
4475520	4476320	And it's like...
4476320	4481360	And we already know like, if we're remotely savvy enough to get jaded about it,
4481360	4482400	that you've never...
4482400	4484720	You have no idea what the truth is now at this point.
4484720	4485200	It's just like...
4487120	4489520	What I want to ask you about measure B is,
4489520	4493200	for the folks that are listening, like, that are in Los Angeles,
4493200	4497040	what can they expect to see on TV or hear from their friends
4497040	4499520	who have saw something that someone else saw on TV
4499520	4503040	that's like the most common, like, reflexive, like, nut kick.
4503040	4505840	Like, well, I heard that's for just people that want to have elephants
4505840	4506480	eat their dick.
4506480	4508880	Well, I heard we don't even know what's gonna happen
4508880	4510880	if we vote yes on measure B.
4510880	4513520	We might be unleashing the gates to the apocalypse
4513520	4515600	because we don't know on paper what it is.
4515600	4516960	Shut up, dude, don't tell them.
4518960	4520080	That is the opposition.
4520080	4523440	That's the biggest opposition is, we don't know what could happen.
4523440	4524800	Maybe demons.
4524800	4525600	Right, pretty much.
4526480	4528880	I'm just glad we chose this opportunity to talk about this
4529840	4532720	on a podcast that will air two days after.
4532720	4533760	Oh, yeah, right, right, right.
4533760	4534880	You're right, you're right.
4534960	4535760	Well, we're talking to.
4535760	4538080	Well, that's a bunch of fired up people here.
4538080	4540640	It makes it makes at least five thousand people here tonight
4541440	4544800	at the diamond tab link letter that will certainly go out and vote tomorrow.
4544800	4547120	You're fair enough, Jeff.
4547120	4547920	You call me a douche?
4547920	4550480	Yeah, I called you two.
4550480	4553920	I called you two because I started I aborted a touche.
4553920	4556480	Okay, it was a shitty touche.
4556480	4557920	However, it actually kind of makes sense
4557920	4560800	because we're talking to the 38 people in Los Angeles
4560800	4562240	that come actually to see the show.
4562240	4562960	They love it.
4562960	4564400	There's more than 38.
4564640	4565120	Four more.
4567440	4569680	Four more audience members.
4569680	4571840	Four more audience members.
4571840	4572560	Don't chant that.
4574000	4574960	So here's the thing.
4574960	4577760	The other thing is people are like, oh, what?
4577760	4579360	The city's going to run a bank.
4579360	4580480	How can they run a bank?
4580480	4582960	Because they can't burp, burp, burp, burp, burp, burp.
4582960	4585520	And so that I've always said that.
4586960	4589600	That's basically literally the guy in the ballot.
4589600	4592240	If you read the ballot, the argument against Measure B,
4592400	4595680	the guy who looks exactly like you think he would,
4595680	4598720	his name is Jack Humphreyville and he has no neck at all.
4598720	4599200	What's up?
4599200	4600000	Jack Humphreyville?
4600000	4600560	Jack Humphreyville.
4600560	4603280	And he literally in the ballot,
4603280	4605120	in the argument against Measure B, he goes,
4605120	4606560	it's baloney.
4608160	4610640	And there's a thing that ran on KCRW today
4610640	4613840	that interviewed a bunch of us organizers for B and him.
4613840	4617600	And he's like, it seems like they're getting stoned.
4618480	4620720	Like those are, that's really what it is.
4620720	4622320	They won't stand for baloney, you know.
4622320	4625600	It seems like the only slippery slope I could think of,
4625600	4628400	I would have to go into like shadow run logic or be like,
4628400	4630560	are you saying that in the year 2040,
4630560	4633520	Los Angeles could be a corporation turning more profit
4633520	4636080	than San Diego and go to war with them?
4636080	4639840	No, but seriously, like, so we want to discuss that
4639840	4641360	because people are worried about that.
4641360	4642400	That is a fear people have.
4642400	4643360	But the reality is-
4643360	4644960	It's a fear I would love to have.
4644960	4646000	Right.
4646000	4647280	I love the opportunity.
4647280	4649280	Los Angeles is a trillionaire.
4649280	4649680	Right.
4649680	4651760	And I think it would be better if,
4651760	4654240	do you guys have a real vision for what it's going to look like?
4654240	4655760	Because a lot of the push has been,
4655760	4657520	oh, we don't have any strong,
4657520	4660240	it's only we're making it legal to talk about now.
4660240	4662240	So then going forward, if it passes,
4662240	4664320	we'll be able to in city councils discuss
4664320	4665920	what we want the shape of this to be
4665920	4667760	and actually legislate it into existence.
4667760	4668800	So we're already doing that.
4668800	4669040	Right.
4669040	4671840	So how is that process going to work
4671840	4673200	and how is it going to prevent us
4673200	4675520	from like just being taken over or whatever?
4675520	4676480	Who's going to govern it?
4676480	4676880	What?
4676960	4679360	The important thing, right, is first and foremost,
4680640	4682400	right now the people in charge of the banks,
4682400	4685520	you have zero means of democracy there.
4685520	4686000	Right.
4686000	4686720	Companies.
4686720	4688720	Lloyd Blankfein would be like, Lloyd.
4688720	4691520	Right now the city just has to get in line with you
4691520	4693680	at Bank of America and open an account.
4693680	4694560	Yes, exactly.
4694560	4695920	And it's like, whatever.
4695920	4698160	Oh, do I get the Ann Gettys checks or what?
4698160	4698400	Yeah.
4700000	4701840	Shout out, Ann Gettys personalized checks.
4701840	4702560	I had them.
4702560	4703600	Oh, yeah.
4703600	4704560	The babies are so cute.
4704560	4705600	They're in flower pots.
4706400	4711280	So what would happen is there would be a very strict charter
4712080	4712880	that we...
4712880	4715440	So city council is letting us organizers
4715440	4716240	have a seat at the table.
4717040	4719120	We are also working on state legislation
4719120	4720000	that would need to be passed
4720000	4721280	in order to make this a possibility.
4721280	4722480	So in doing that...
4722480	4724880	Because statewide it's also illegal, right?
4724880	4725200	Yes.
4725200	4725760	Right.
4725760	4727840	But other cities have already...
4727840	4728320	Made movements.
4728320	4729520	Because of their charters,
4729520	4732320	they're able to do what Measure B would do for LA.
4732320	4733840	Oakland and San Francisco specifically.
4733840	4734640	They're already working on it.
4734640	4735440	They're already working on it.
4736240	4737600	They're like, okay, we've got task force
4737600	4739040	and it's not shitty bankers.
4739040	4741520	They're letting the organizers lead the way
4741520	4742800	because everybody's like,
4742800	4745200	oh, this saves us billions of dollars
4745200	4746640	and we get to fill in pot holes.
4746640	4749040	So it's kind of okay that we're talking about it
4749040	4750000	on our podcast.
4751680	4752480	Well, I hope so.
4752480	4754560	Because it's like medical marijuana a couple of years ago.
4754560	4756080	It's like an issue that's...
4756080	4759040	Maybe the referendums will be different numbers and things.
4759040	4759360	Yes.
4759360	4760160	It's gonna start...
4760160	4761360	This is like a harbinger.
4761360	4763040	Hopefully this can be a domino effect.
4763040	4765680	So what happens next is there's the...
4765680	4767040	It's just a slick harbinger.
4767760	4773840	So what happens next is the charter has to be very strict
4773840	4777920	and it has to say we will not invest in oil pipelines
4777920	4780320	or private prisons or fucking baby cages
4780320	4781120	or any of that shit.
4781120	4781680	I can't...
4781680	4783360	It might say I literally can't believe
4783360	4785120	I have to write baby cages, but here we are.
4786320	4787200	Baby cages.
4787200	4788320	No to that.
4788320	4791600	I never thought I'd have to not check this box.
4791600	4792160	Right.
4792160	4793840	Never thought this box would have to be an option,
4793840	4794560	but here we are.
4795680	4796160	And so...
4797200	4798800	And then also prioritize, right?
4798800	4803520	Like if we're going to not all die in 40 years,
4803520	4805840	like the UN's report just said might happen.
4806720	4809120	They've been saying that for eight years.
4811600	4813840	First it was 48 years.
4813840	4815840	Then it was 47.
4817040	4818160	Seven years later.
4818160	4820400	No, it's 40 years.
4820400	4822240	The world's going to end.
4822240	4825920	But maybe if you do something in 20, you could maybe...
4826480	4828160	Blah, blah, blah.
4828160	4830320	I went jogging the other day.
4830320	4832960	It was warm or I'm sorry, cold.
4835680	4837680	Weather changes, people.
4837680	4838240	All right, sorry.
4839920	4840080	So...
4843600	4846480	Again, there's something about pajamas that has made you...
4846480	4848000	No, it's alcoholism.
4848000	4848720	I'm so drunk.
4848720	4849760	Okay, well...
4849760	4850800	That rules.
4850800	4854560	But you're wearing your alcoholism like micro-modal fiber, right?
4854560	4855200	Yeah.
4855200	4858400	I hope that Miondi's consumers at a compatible marketing point.
4858400	4860960	It's three times softer than normal alcohols.
4860960	4863360	Can we get a momentary nipple update?
4863360	4864400	Where are your nipples at?
4864400	4865280	It's fine, actually.
4865280	4866800	So that's a good advertiser, too.
4866800	4868560	Hey, are you a nipple guy?
4869120	4869840	Don't worry about it.
4869840	4875040	Do you get horny when soft things touch your nipples?
4875600	4878240	Are you therefore worried about wearing a Miondi...
4879200	4880000	onesie?
4881040	4881920	I'm Dan Harmon.
4882960	4887760	I've been sitting up here wearing draped in fabric
4887760	4889760	and I've been talking about banking for an hour.
4891760	4893040	I ain't got no heart on.
4894960	4896880	Miondi's, I ain't got no heart on.
4898080	4899440	I'm gonna sleep like a baby.
4900720	4902240	Baby ain't got no heart on.
4904160	4906240	Maybe we'll go back to the drawing board on the baby one.
4906240	4909840	But anyway, if we're gonna mobilize enough capital
4909840	4911840	to not all die in 40 years,
4911840	4915840	we're gonna need to do it by a lot of money in the billions
4915840	4919120	and a public bank after five years will be able to renew...
4919680	4922080	We're talking renewable energy for whole neighborhoods,
4922080	4924240	solar panels, batteries, all that shit,
4924240	4927280	because we're taking billions that were going to bad stuff
4927280	4928640	and putting it to good stuff.
4928640	4930320	Morally, it's pretty black and white.
4930320	4930880	Right.
4930880	4935440	I remember Sarah Silverman talking about this years ago
4935520	4936240	and there was a couple...
4937360	4939440	This is sort of a cousin of...
4940320	4941360	Divestment.
4941360	4942160	Yeah, divestment.
4942160	4943280	That's what she was talking about.
4943280	4946640	To get it out of your nationally-franchised banks
4946640	4947840	and put it into credit unions,
4947840	4952160	which I have not done yet and I should do.
4952160	4952880	You should, because...
4952880	4954320	Scared my accountant will yell at me.
4955840	4957280	You gotta be afraid of an accountant your whole life.
4957280	4958640	But the idea there is that,
4958640	4961840	hey, if your bank, God bless their soul,
4961840	4964240	they don't have to be evil to be following
4964240	4965840	the marching orders of like,
4965840	4967520	we're supposed to make more money
4967520	4968960	than the bank across the street,
4968960	4970960	which is also an international bank.
4970960	4973760	So of course, your funds are going to tend to end up...
4973760	4973920	Right.
4973920	4974960	Arisol missed it across the planet.
4974960	4977440	You know, I've heard, Dan, that Josh has invested
4977440	4981040	all of his $500,000 winnings from the casino into Mattress.
4983600	4984000	Sealy.
4984000	4984480	Wait, wait.
4984480	4985600	At his house.
4985600	4986480	I'm Casper.
4986480	4987520	He's the friendly boy.
4987520	4988800	Casper, sorry, Casper.
4988800	4989600	That's me.
4989600	4990960	I'm the Mattress guy.
4990960	4994160	I put all of my Rick and Morty merchandise
4994320	4995760	and money in one blue apron.
4997520	4998960	The bluest apron of all.
4998960	5000400	Because there's no better investment
5000400	5002960	than a meal delivered to your home in pieces
5002960	5006880	that you then assemble.
5009440	5012640	Have the satisfaction of an adult while remaining a child.
5014640	5017600	It's like Korean barbecue, but for other genres of food.
5020880	5022800	It's the same lifestyle you're used to.
5024720	5027280	We have your credit card number, but you do half the work, too.
5029120	5031120	From a distance, you'll look like a grown-up.
5032240	5034080	Oh, you don't have time to pick and choose
5034080	5035520	your own fucking things, baby.
5035520	5038240	Take the box, please.
5041520	5044320	Think of it as adulting wheels.
5047600	5049520	Don't have time to check the cabbage?
5049520	5055520	I don't have time to know whether you should buy cabbage.
5057200	5058080	We will give you a box.
5058080	5059680	Honey, did you check cabbage today?
5060320	5063120	There will be a bag of cabbage in it that will say,
5063120	5064640	pour me into a skillet.
5064640	5066880	What about a new service that picks you up
5066880	5069760	like a Lyft or an Uber or a Postmate or a Grub Hubs
5069760	5073040	or whatever, and there's just an adult-sized shopping cart
5073040	5074400	that you get to sit in like a baby?
5075920	5077600	Oh, my god, that would be amazing.
5077680	5080400	And you get to go through a farmer's market
5080400	5081280	and learn how to buy.
5081280	5082560	Are you fucking kidding me?
5085520	5089840	Now, this guy's talking about fucking, like, god damn it.
5089840	5090960	You could do a cheaper one.
5090960	5093360	A giant Lilly Tomlin shopping cart
5093360	5098640	where you get to remember, you sit facing a fucking dude
5098640	5101600	who's like, or whatever, a parental figure,
5103040	5104480	who's like, well, what are you like?
5105440	5109680	And you're encouraged to be like, they tell you like,
5109680	5114720	they're like, do not, you are not here to please this person.
5114720	5118160	Like, we want you to cry, throw a tantrum.
5119280	5121200	Like, test us, test us.
5121200	5122160	And it's like, they're starting.
5122160	5123520	They just wheel you around.
5123520	5125680	And they go like, do you like Lucky Charms?
5125680	5126320	They're like, no.
5128240	5129840	And you just get to like, fucking, can you,
5129840	5132160	I have so much rage and shame in me right now
5132160	5133680	that would be exercised by that.
5134320	5136480	I know it sounds like a big fucking joke,
5136480	5139680	but I'm so, and I know it's not really viable
5139680	5141120	as a financial institution.
5142320	5143120	But that sounds.
5143120	5144000	I got some money.
5144000	5146400	I would pay so much.
5146400	5147760	If they said, like, have you ever,
5147760	5151120	have you ever gone grocery, grocery dolting or?
5153520	5155360	What about like the Uber pool version of that?
5155360	5156640	Would it be like a double wide
5156640	5158400	so everybody gets to kick their legs out?
5158400	5160160	Yeah, you do it with brands and you get to like,
5160160	5161760	pedal the cart, like one of those beer.
5162320	5164960	If you pay less, they have to be just in the cart
5164960	5167200	and they get like carrots put on them or whatever.
5167200	5168400	Oh, how amazing would it be
5168400	5171360	if like the person was a giant robot?
5172400	5175040	That was just like mom legs from like Muppet Babies
5175040	5175600	or whatever.
5175600	5178080	And you could like throw food at it and go like,
5178080	5179920	fuck you, bitch, fuck you.
5181280	5183440	I don't want to go to school tomorrow.
5183440	5185520	Don't yell, Daniel.
5185520	5187600	You're sitting on just this wire mesh bench
5187600	5189120	with your best friends.
5189120	5189440	Yeah.
5189440	5191280	Who like group onto this experience
5191760	5194800	and you pedal and you go like, let's go.
5194800	5195520	So what do you guys want to do?
5195520	5197840	And you just go, let's go to the beer aisle
5197840	5199920	and it's like, give us beer.
5199920	5201520	And the robots program to go like,
5201520	5204880	you're not old enough, blue be blue blue.
5205680	5208320	And you're just like, fuck you, you piece of shit.
5209600	5212400	Are you sure you meant to talk to your mother like that?
5212400	5213200	Dan Harmon.
5215680	5216800	Dan Harmon party.
5217360	5221040	Dan Harmon party guest one.
5222320	5223920	Dan Harmon party.
5223920	5226080	Were any of you asked to be born?
5228240	5229600	We weren't asked to be born.
5229600	5230240	I'm so happy.
5230240	5231920	My dumb idea got this much traction.
5231920	5233120	That's so good.
5233120	5237200	I mean, that's that is like, like, like fucking to sit.
5237200	5239680	Like, like, I think we all had a visceral memory
5239680	5241440	except maybe a couple of people are like,
5241440	5242080	must be nice.
5244880	5246640	And I don't, I don't want to hear their story.
5247360	5251040	But, but, but, but, but like that, that like that feel
5251040	5254000	that I just forgot, you know, because it's not something
5254000	5255840	that's celebrated it, but it's like, holy shit,
5255840	5258560	like putting your little tushy in a fucking shopping cart
5258560	5260880	and wheeling your crabby little ass around
5260880	5262960	and asking what you like and don't like.
5262960	5265680	It's not like you've got anything that you wanted, right?
5266880	5269520	But it's actually the agency is what's delicious.
5269520	5272080	So it's like, you're just being able to go like,
5272080	5273760	we want bananas.
5274640	5275600	We got bananas.
5275920	5277520	Those are green.
5277520	5282000	They turn yellow eventually says you, you know,
5282000	5283760	it's just the right to be a little prick.
5283760	5285840	I don't mean to like burst the bubble,
5285840	5288400	but I feel like with like the right amount of mushrooms,
5288400	5289680	you could do this from your very home.
5292160	5293520	Well, virtual reality.
5294560	5296960	That that's could be a huge, it's sort of like,
5296960	5299040	remember in the 70s, I remember references
5299040	5302000	like like primal scream therapy, you know, like, like,
5302000	5304880	like make fun of everything, but it's like,
5304880	5307360	I'm telling you, man, I've been through some shit this year.
5308560	5310640	I'm aware of the fact that I have not been through
5310640	5312800	nearly as much shit as almost anyone listening.
5313920	5318960	That is not how I measure shit is by your measurement.
5318960	5321440	But my point is like, I've been through some shit
5321440	5325120	this year that most notably I can't talk about.
5325120	5328560	And it builds this fucking, my therapist has told me
5328560	5329600	so many weeks in a row.
5329600	5331920	She's like, you're gonna go get a drink?
5331920	5333840	Are you gonna medicate this?
5333840	5335280	And I'm like, probably.
5337280	5340320	Like, no, ain't no one invented nothing better.
5342560	5343040	She did.
5343040	5344400	It's called weed, dog.
5344400	5346720	Well, I don't know, dude, we I don't know.
5346720	5348640	I mean, I don't want I don't want to just from the hip,
5348640	5349920	like negate that.
5350800	5352880	Because sometimes it says no cops on it.
5352880	5354080	That's more of a crapshoot.
5354720	5356960	For me, where it's like, I hit the wrong weed
5356960	5358160	at the wrong time in the wrong amount.
5358160	5360000	And then all of a sudden, I'm like, what are you doing?
5360000	5361920	You're you know, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5362240	5365840	But booze is as old as a fucking cowboy biting a belt.
5365840	5368400	Like you suck a snake venom out of his titty.
5369440	5371200	And then he gives you a free gun.
5371200	5373200	It's just fucking brute force.
5373200	5374880	That was by far across the head.
5374880	5376400	Fucking you're drunk now.
5377120	5379920	The trouble being that you, as my therapist says,
5379920	5381440	she's like, it's a preservative.
5381440	5382720	Like, what do we do with shit?
5382720	5384480	And it's like, sometimes she's a little clever
5384480	5384960	about this stuff.
5384960	5387440	But I think it's like, it's like, yeah, it it does.
5388080	5388880	It preserves it.
5388880	5390640	Like, I have no place to put my rage.
5390720	5392080	I'm like, I'm like punching shit.
5392080	5393120	I got bloody knuckles.
5393120	5395440	Like, I'm like, I'm like, every once in a while,
5395440	5397120	I'm erupting into this rage.
5397120	5399920	And I think that it's like, sooner or later,
5399920	5401120	I'm going to put it somewhere.
5401840	5407440	And it could be a place that hurts me or another person.
5407440	5411840	And I feel like actually, like, we must all feel that constantly.
5411840	5415600	Where it's like, well, how when do I get to shit my pants?
5416800	5419680	I just think it's a wonderful like, like, like, actually,
5419760	5421680	maybe that's what virtual reality could be.
5421680	5423600	It's like, you throw these tantrums.
5423600	5425440	You just go like, I'm a baby.
5426480	5429440	That's what this podcast was for me up until this last year.
5430160	5431760	This is where I came to sit.
5431760	5433040	This is ask these guys.
5433040	5435360	They'll tell you they've been pushing me in a shopping cart.
5438240	5439360	Damn, Harmon.
5439360	5441520	And I've been I've been going, give me fruit lips.
5441520	5443280	And you guys have been like, what do you mean?
5443280	5445520	Do you want to be socially conscious?
5445520	5447520	And I'm like, I don't know.
5448240	5449920	Depends if I have to or not.
5452640	5455200	But then, like, there was this marking point of like,
5455200	5458880	January 2018, where it was like, okay, strategically,
5458880	5461760	and hell for every reason in every column,
5461760	5468480	Dan, you're not allowed to say what you're feeling and thinking.
5468480	5470800	And what is a tantrum?
5470800	5473120	It's like, it's the most obnoxious, horrible thing.
5473120	5474720	And we associate it with children.
5474720	5476000	And we're like, you piece of shit.
5476000	5477040	You should never look.
5477040	5480320	Look at that fucking and we and we literally you're in an airport
5480320	5485280	and you hear a kid going like, like, we hate them.
5485280	5486560	We should hate them.
5486560	5488560	It's like terrible, terrible little people.
5488560	5490800	They're having the fucking tantrum in the middle of an airport.
5490800	5495840	Like our species, maybe that's the that's the next wheel is like,
5495840	5496880	can we find it?
5496880	5498240	Because what are we having right now?
5498240	5502400	Politically, we're having tantrums, tantrums over everyone's having a fucking tantrum.
5502400	5504800	I mean, so, okay, a couple of things.
5504800	5508320	One, sorry, we'll get there, though.
5508320	5509040	We'll get there.
5509040	5511360	Rage cage, rage cage.
5511360	5517200	It's it's a concept that's like Japanese therapy that was very hilariously used
5517200	5520480	in the show Delocated, which is like a criminally underrated show.
5521520	5526240	And it's just a room that they set up and they just give you a fucking hammer.
5526240	5529600	And it's just like a sink and fucking old TV.
5529600	5531840	And I thought like another person.
5531840	5532800	I'm like, I don't know.
5532800	5534000	No, no, no, no.
5534000	5535520	Yeah, I'm not a billionaire.
5535520	5536240	It's called murder.
5537280	5537760	You drink.
5537760	5538560	Only a millionaire.
5538560	5539680	I can't.
5539680	5540800	You're Peter Thiel.
5540800	5542240	I get killed with impunity.
5542960	5545840	No, it's it's it's just stuff.
5545840	5547440	It's property, which is not violence.
5548480	5551360	It's vandalism when property is destroyed and therefore it's fine.
5551360	5553280	Yeah, but is anyone whatever?
5553280	5554160	I'm not going to poop with that.
5554160	5554640	Thank you for sure.
5554640	5555440	There's that.
5555440	5558080	The other thing I would say is like, politically speaking, at least.
5558880	5562000	Sorry to be uncle fucking socialism.
5562000	5564800	But if we get rid of his name is Uncle.
5566560	5570960	If we get rid of all the horrible things that we are willingly participating in
5570960	5575360	and also just make things better in the way that we absolutely know is possible,
5575360	5577760	then everybody wouldn't feel like screaming all the time.
5577760	5581440	Well, you just feel like a crazy person because you're like, we all know better than this.
5581440	5584640	Well, can I bring up a thing that I'm really jealous of our forebears of,
5584640	5587680	which is that maybe this is the oversimplification that happens when you
5588400	5591040	look backwards because maybe it wasn't simple back then.
5591040	5597040	But all these historical chapters that we look at counterculturally,
5597040	5601520	it's always the people that are unashamed versus the people that are ashamed.
5601520	5603920	And we don't have that culture war going on right now.
5603920	5610000	We have two different kinds of people that are both willing to engage in shame and fear,
5610000	5612560	arguing with each other about which type of shame should pay,
5612560	5614640	which type of dividend and which amount.
5614640	5616720	And it's like, how are you going to win that fight?
5617360	5623760	There's got to be some way to fucking move this line so that it's in that classic tradition of
5623760	5628400	like, look, man, you can fucking make fun of everybody you want.
5628400	5630640	You can harass anyone you want.
5630640	5633120	But if you're harassing them, they're on my side.
5633120	5634320	I don't fucking care.
5634320	5638320	I am not signing up for this Boy Scout troop where everyone dresses the same
5638320	5642080	and doesn't have any fun and let the enemy say, no, we have fun.
5643040	5645280	And let them prove it because they can't.
5645840	5648080	Hey, man, that is happening.
5648080	5650880	But they can prove that they have fun when they're trolling us
5650880	5653440	and watching us dance like monkeys when we're going like,
5654560	5656880	someone told me that there's something outrageous over here.
5656880	5659440	And they're laughing all the way to the fucking troll bank.
5660320	5661440	It's like, we got to take that power.
5661440	5662320	I hate that bank.
5662320	5663440	Vote no on the troll bank.
5664640	5665520	That pays nothing.
5665520	5667840	We got to figure out how to put that in the hands of the city.
5669520	5672000	The troll bank just traffics them like Pepe Bitcoin.
5672160	5676160	We got to get you got to answer three riddles before you can get a deposit.
5677600	5679440	So the bank's going to be under a bridge.
5679440	5679920	I know.
5681120	5685120	I think like the thing that they're now delighting in is like just overt
5685120	5690480	racism because that's they have kind of been retreated to a point where it's like,
5690480	5696880	I guess we got to take pride in this because, you know, Taylor Swift is mad at us and Kanye
5696880	5701840	stopping into politics now, you know, there's going to be a treasure trove to the extent
5701840	5705440	that we progress to the point where 10 years ago everyone was racist.
5705440	5709600	Then that means that everyone can now go back 10 years and find something racist.
5709600	5712000	You said, which we should all be mindful of and go.
5712000	5713040	Yeah, shit changes.
5713040	5719840	I was fucking I said shit that is bad 10 years ago, but we are in this mode.
5719840	5722000	I think of like that.
5722000	5724800	My only point I'm not even trying to say, you know what we need to do?
5725360	5728240	I only came up because talking about tantrums.
5728240	5731680	I think the reason why tantrums are so exciting to me right now
5731680	5736080	is because actually we're constantly throwing them online at each other,
5736080	5737680	even people that are on our side.
5737680	5740640	We are just frothing at the mouth.
5740640	5745280	And if you told a Martian what level of technology we were at and then said,
5746000	5750480	you know, they would say, oh, we've achieved tantrum technology.
5750480	5754320	Well, if you told them we've achieved the technology where anyone from any device,
5754320	5759280	no matter what their income level, basically like with the price of a fucking book of matches,
5759360	5763200	you could basically have an opportunity to type anything anywhere and it would be seen
5763200	5766080	by everyone depending on whether or not anyone thought it was worth reading.
5766720	5769280	That all sounds to me like the Martian would go.
5769280	5774800	Oh, so you probably have a lot less frothing at the mouth and fucking crazy tirades, right?
5774800	5776560	And it's like, and then you go, no, the opposite.
5776560	5781440	And then the Martian would go, well, then something must be wrong that you're not telling me.
5781440	5782640	The technology is so new.
5782640	5787200	We've never before been so plugged into what's happening exactly everywhere.
5787200	5789600	And like our brains aren't used to like being like,
5789600	5792240	hey, here's this horrible thing happening in a country.
5792240	5795360	I'm just telling you about for the first time ever.
5795360	5798800	You're going to learn about a brand new country because of a horrible thing that's happened.
5798800	5800720	All that information is now in your brain.
5800720	5803920	But something that's not new is something that a lot of our parents
5803920	5806240	like kept telling us in kindergarten teachers, which is like,
5806800	5809920	if you don't have if you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all.
5809920	5814640	If you don't like golden rule shit that we think goes out the window because we're looking at
5814640	5817920	something that that excites us, that traumatizes us.
5817920	5821840	We believe that there's a deal breaker that's present in all.
5821840	5824960	But yeah, but it's on my phone and it's like, no, motherfucker.
5824960	5828000	That's exactly the point where you're being tested.
5828000	5828240	Right.
5828240	5832160	Well, it's because you're not looking at a human being and getting the facial recognition
5832160	5833440	of like, oh, you're a person.
5833440	5836080	You're not going to get your ass kicked, for instance.
5836080	5838320	You're not going to get punched in the face.
5838320	5842160	You're not going to have to not make eye contact with someone that's more powerful than you.
5842160	5846080	All this all this shit that we should be the three worst things we should be ashamed of
5846800	5850000	as far as incentivizations to express ourselves or not.
5850000	5854800	And that's another reason why we're being tested and trained by this technology.
5854800	5859840	It's like, like, oh, I just watched a guy get shot to death on a street.
5860720	5864000	And I watched the cops gun tremble in his hand.
5864000	5867840	Like I like and then and then I and then I have a bad day at work.
5867840	5871600	And then my therapist goes like, yeah, but don't you think your body
5871680	5876000	knew you saw that and were like, yeah, but I didn't talk about it.
5876000	5876960	I didn't retweeted.
5876960	5880320	I didn't say, yeah, but you're you fucking took it in.
5880320	5881760	You're being traumatized.
5881760	5884080	Now, it's not like we need to turn our backs on that.
5884080	5891440	But it's like we are currently acting like it's normal to watch people get shot and killed.
5891440	5897120	Like it's normal to wake up every day to the news that everyone's a piece of shit and that
5897120	5899840	we're all going to die, which may or may not be true.
5899840	5901440	I'm not saying that's a lie.
5901440	5904880	But it's fucking weird messaging to get when you wake up.
5904880	5907920	And I'm telling you, we didn't get it when I was a kid every day.
5907920	5909520	Fred Durst didn't come on the fucking TV.
5909520	5914400	I got the message when I was your age that Snoopy hated Mondays.
5914400	5916960	I like good depending on you got that message wrong.
5918400	5919200	It's Garfield.
5921360	5923440	You got it that we just kicked the Kaiser's ass.
5925680	5928000	I'm sure Snoopy hated Mondays to die by fire.
5928000	5931600	Oh, speaking of down vote.
5931600	5932320	Speaking of fire.
5932320	5934000	You're really haunting the F house, dude.
5934000	5934640	Oh, man.
5934640	5935680	Haunting the F house.
5936400	5937680	No, you're ancient.
5937680	5938880	Too many times.
5938880	5939680	Too many times.
5941200	5942400	Uh, whatever.
5942400	5945520	I'm I'm it's tantrum tantrum technology.
5945520	5946320	That's what we need.
5946320	5949600	We need we need primal scream assisting technology.
5949600	5953840	I think like truly because I'm telling you, I'm still walking around.
5953840	5957440	I can now measure it by therapy because my therapist will ask me.
5957440	5959040	What's happening in here?
5959040	5964320	I have a column of rage inside of me that I can measure and observe.
5964320	5966880	And I don't have to act on it because I'm 45.
5966880	5968720	I can just let it sit and burn.
5969440	5971680	But I know when it's zero.
5971680	5974640	I know when I'm like a fucking kite in the wind.
5974640	5975760	Oh, and I'm like, whoa.
5977440	5978480	Pearl jamming lyrics.
5979440	5983040	I like like I feel I feel it every once in a while.
5983040	5985760	You become drunk Eddie Vedder.
5985840	5987440	But it keeps height Eddie Vedder.
5987440	5988720	It keeps filling up.
5988720	5990800	It fills up and then you can feel it.
5990800	5996480	You know, it's it's it's you can you can punch a wall and have it really not go down.
5996480	5996960	Right.
5996960	5999840	There is you really punch a wall and really bloody your knuckles.
5999840	6000880	I've been punching.
6000880	6007440	I have punched more walls this year than I punched the year I got divorced.
6007440	6013840	Like I and it's been in the last couple of months and it's been because of outrage
6014400	6019600	about shit that I can't talk about.
6019600	6024480	And it's largely been about that meta fact that I can't fucking talk about it.
6024480	6027680	So I punch a fucking wall because what the what else am I going to do?
6027680	6036640	The alternative would be to pollute my relationship with Cody to pollute my my workplace to where do
6036640	6046720	you go when you are filled with just a foundational fucking incompatibility with a planet full of idiots?
6046720	6047600	TJ Maxx.
6050320	6051280	That's their slogan.
6053840	6056080	I think it's self-destructive of them.
6056080	6059200	Yeah, I think I think I think it flew in the face of their base.
6059200	6063520	But where do you go when you have a foundational
6063520	6066400	incompatibility with a planet of idiots?
6066400	6067520	TJ Maxx.
6069200	6069920	It's catchy.
6069920	6070720	You gotta give them that.
6070720	6074000	All this summer men's pants are two by two.
6074000	6074880	We got shelves and stuff.
6074880	6075920	I don't know how clothes work.
6078000	6080000	Do they sell them like animals on the ark?
6080000	6082000	Marching on the ark two by two.
6086480	6089200	I think that it I mean, I don't know.
6089200	6095520	I feel like there's a lot of people right now who just have a voice for the first time
6095520	6096320	with the Internet.
6096320	6100960	There are folks in marginalized groups that are speaking up for the first time.
6100960	6108480	There are people who are like us who are white men who aren't really used to being challenged a lot.
6109360	6110320	That's happening now.
6110320	6115280	And it's up to us to just sort of be like, well, you know, we kind of just got to suck it up and deal
6115280	6117840	because, boy, oh, boy, has it been easy to be a white man.
6117840	6119360	It's certainly a credit card debt to pay.
6119360	6120560	I'm really glad you brought that up.
6120560	6125200	Yeah, not only not only did three years ago on this podcast that I knew, you know,
6125200	6131200	I wanted to make sure I acknowledge that that as far as voting concerns, like, like, you know,
6131200	6136160	I was the, you know, on this very podcast, I was I have changed from a guy who was like,
6136160	6137200	your vote doesn't matter.
6138560	6141840	And I was in my 40s saying that I used to say, too.
6141840	6145120	So that, you know, but if you asked me at that time, I'd like to say,
6145120	6149120	if you asked me what my deal breaker was, I would have I would say, I don't know, a fascist coup.
6149120	6152880	But but however, like, I'm glad you brought that.
6152880	6156320	That's the more important thing to bring up because I was 25 once.
6156320	6158240	I'm going to give it 20 years ago.
6158240	6161120	And when I was when I was 25.
6162720	6168960	Yeah, I mean, if I was living in this world now, would I leave an Instagram comment on
6168960	6177440	a man's Instagram whose cartoon I liked telling him to get back to work because his cartoon
6177440	6178480	is like, no, never.
6178480	6179920	No, those people are horrible.
6179920	6180480	Yeah, they are.
6180480	6184320	However, but but but you know, now they have a voice.
6186640	6188480	But but nerds have never been oppressed.
6188480	6195280	But a lot of the people who who are saying things like we have been we've been equalized.
6195280	6196720	Like you can't.
6196720	6204480	It's the very beginning of the start of a whisper of it from a emotionally retarded
6204480	6210400	19 year old from a 25 year old who's been abused as a child from a 36 year old.
6210400	6215280	Like the all of that shit is out the window, which is probably ultimately if we survive
6215280	6218240	this rapture, a better thing than a worse thing, right?
6218240	6225440	Because throwing out biological strata is probably going to could benefit us if we survive this.
6225520	6229040	Yeah, we're all going to need to work together to survive the horrible things
6229040	6231040	that are in store for us in the future.
6231840	6236160	But I guess that means that if you're a 45 year old and you're like, I hate the world,
6236160	6241920	like the test upon you, if I expect today's 25 year old to comport themselves with some dignity
6241920	6246320	when they're leaving comments on my girlfriend's Instagram, there should also be that I have to
6246320	6253440	look at myself as Gandalf and go, well, you have responsibilities to kind of if if a if a if a if
6253440	6258720	peregrine took knocks a barrel down a well, like what if what if Gandalf had just been like,
6258720	6265280	you piece of shit, I'm going to skin you alive. And then the the ogres came and he's like,
6265280	6271120	just take him. I don't care. I fucking hate Middle Earth. Did you know wizards aren't even men?
6271120	6276000	They're like a different species in this world. I'm a fucking elite. I'm out of here.
6276000	6282720	Teleport level nine. I'm I'm Gandalf the purple in a world without dipshits.
6285600	6289200	I come here for fun. I love the image of Gandalf being like,
6289760	6298240	boring. He kind of does. Big deal. He does do that. But I'm realizing now, okay,
6298240	6303440	maybe don't be irritated by him because he also he's the acid test is he goes,
6303440	6309280	you shall not pass to a fucking ballrog. He's out there. And he says, fly you fools.
6311360	6315920	To be fair to him, he gets to apparently live through that, which no one else does.
6316640	6323760	Like, oh, hey, where are you? Well, I lost that fight to the demon and fell through a thing. And
6323760	6330720	then I am back. I think he that's a good metaphor for the structural benefit that being a white man
6330720	6336160	has in this society. You don't have to fight the ballrog that hard. Right. I've prestige. Yeah,
6336160	6342880	you just become Gandalf the white. Yeah. Gandalf the toxic male white. Gandalf the Gandalf the
6342880	6348160	white fragile. The problematic. The fragile white gun owner.
6350640	6353360	You could take my staff for my cold, dead hands.
6356080	6359520	I didn't buy it because I'm conservative. I bought it because they're rude in the world.
6361520	6366160	I don't know why I'm using this voice when that's literally my justification for having bought a
6366160	6372080	gun. Did you buy a gun? Yeah, because I might kill myself. Oh, all right. Well, that's actually a
6372080	6375520	reason. I mean, because that's one of the things that might know that's not that I was supposed to
6375520	6385760	get a laugh too. Oh, right. It's true. It's probably true that I would maybe. Right. That's
6385760	6391840	why everyone didn't laugh. Dan, let's talk about satire works.
6394800	6401360	Well, satire works truth and jest. I mean, but I'm like, like, no, it's just because if I were to
6401360	6408000	ever, like, for instance, I would never, I'm never going to kill myself because unless, unless,
6408480	6415840	I would never as Cody dies. If Cody dies, my, my promise is not broken. If Cody is already
6415840	6423360	backtracking. So you what you just said, I'll never kill myself. Wait a second. You have not
6423360	6428000	ruled out murder, suicide. That's good to know. No, no, I'm not going to murder. That's a strange
6428000	6434240	read. But it was technically true. It was interesting. It was interesting in a Chimaliani
6434240	6439840	kind of. Yeah. I like the way you're thinking as a screenwriter. Yeah. Right. I like that you made
6439840	6448160	Chimaliana an adjective. That was very nice. It's more Yiddish. I thought it was like,
6448160	6458720	Oh, what's this? What's this? What's this? What's this? What's this? What's this? What's this? What's
6458720	6463760	this? If they lived in a village, what did you tell it is live in a village?
6465040	6470000	This is a way to end a movie. She goes to a gas station. What water? The whole place is covered
