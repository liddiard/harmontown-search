0	18280	From Hollywood, California, at the secret confines of Meltdown Comics back room, Harmon
18280	37840	Meltdown is now in session, let's figure out our game master, Mr. Spencer Kenton, and
37840	54000	this is the condition, our mayor, Mr. Kenton, Harmon.
54000	56120	Spencer, why don't you talk to Jeff for a second?
56120	58600	Hey Jeff, is that your musical choice?
58600	59600	That was really good.
59600	62240	Damn it, god damn it!
62240	65760	Stop the show!
65760	75040	You drop the chicken tongues, you drop the chicken tongues, Spencer, right now, while
75040	79920	Dan tries to make himself a drink, right now, what geopolitically is bothering you the
79920	81920	most right now?
81920	83440	Geopolitically?
83440	89000	What in the world is bothering Spencer right now?
89000	92200	The gang violence in Mexico.
92200	93200	For real?
93200	95200	Yeah, it's not a joke.
95200	102080	It would be if you had told us in advance that we could prepare the appropriate theme
102080	107680	music.
107680	112560	Violence in Mexico, yeah.
112560	114800	Get us up to date with what's going on in Mexico right now.
114800	119200	I think it's mostly still just the same stuff, you know, like the gangs are just fucking
119200	121680	shooting everyone all the time.
121680	127920	It's just shootouts in the streets, I mean, it's just violence, non-stop, drug wars, war
127920	133600	on drugs, war on crime, you know, our war on drugs isn't helping, I'll tell you that
133600	134600	right now.
134600	140880	I don't think stopping the war on drugs would solve the problem though, I'll be honest.
140880	145600	I've always said, why not a war on spiders?
145600	151440	Drugs don't dangle down on string and go into your mouth while you're sleeping.
151680	156160	They don't lay a million eggs and crawl around with them on their body and then scatter.
156160	160720	They don't have tiny green reflections in their eyes that you can see if you shine a
160720	161720	flashlight.
161720	162720	Yeah.
162720	164920	I bet I read it a lot this weekend.
164920	170320	Because I was supposed to write and I finished the script but not until I had gone down all
170320	171320	these.
171320	179720	The things that I'll do to keep from writing are like so, like I would, like in my third
179720	187240	hour of like investigating, going down the rabbit hole of Sandy Hook conspiracy theories.
187240	194840	I was like, you'd rather, you just, you're surrounded by dead children, like in your
194840	198360	mind rather than working.
198360	202960	And you're like, what's the leading conspiracy theory on Sandy Hook?
202960	208840	These people are, I'm sorry, gang, but you're bad people, like I don't know why I'm apologizing
208840	209840	to them.
209840	211760	I guess because like, but I mean, here's the thing.
211760	217080	Some people love their guns so much that you're like 20 kids for your gun and they're like,
217080	219000	they're like, well, that's a lot of kids.
219000	221760	Too bad that hasn't happened.
221760	222760	You know?
222760	223760	And so you're like, no, it just happened.
223760	226520	And they're like, show me a picture.
226520	230480	Show me a picture of the 20 kids and we're like, that's gross.
230480	234360	And they're like, no gun, like conspiracy.
234360	236360	They think the conspiracy is that it didn't really happen.
236360	237360	They think it didn't happen.
237360	242240	Or that it was perpetrated by, because the conspiracy theories have the luxury of going
242240	243240	from the end result.
243240	249480	So anything is like, anything that would service ultimately, for instance, an anti-gun agenda,
249480	252520	then you can just write backwards your conspiracy.
252520	254520	You can rube Goldberg too.
254520	258320	And you don't even need to do that because you can just go, hi, how come this woman's
258320	259400	name is Cheerio?
259400	264440	But when you look at the Cheerio's box, it says no trans fat.
264440	266640	But then look at what this guy in CNN is saying.
266640	273240	There's a fine line between conspiracy theory, passion, and just absolute schizophrenia.
273240	276400	Just noticing connections, connecting dots.
276400	278480	Do you have a conspiracy that you adhere to?
278480	282320	Is there a thing that you think that there might be a conspiracy on?
282320	283320	I do.
283320	290840	Because I haven't researched it, I am quite fond of the idea that, who's the original?
290840	294080	That the Honeycomb Hideout was actually a terrorist cell?
294080	301600	William Randolph Hearst and the DuPont Company, the reason pot was vilified was because hemp
301600	306360	would have made paper cheaper and didn't need to be chemically treated by DuPont the right
306360	307360	way and all that stuff.
307360	310560	I like the pot stuff.
310560	313360	I believe that stuff.
313360	317120	The real conspiracy is that you can track all drug legislation in the United States
317120	321360	to like, there was this crazy depressing documentary about it.
321360	328760	That drug policy is linked inexorably throughout our history to racial politics.
328760	334280	If you have a lot of Chinese labor in your country, opium becomes illegal because there's
334280	337520	a culture to this drug that they bring in with them.
337520	341800	It's something that they're using, that they brought with them.
341800	345280	You make it illegal, so you're effectively making it possible to kick in their doors
345280	348440	anytime you want or do anything you want.
348440	356080	That drug policy has always made a handy leash on any group that we've wanted to just
356080	357680	have extra power over.
357680	362680	Spencer, do you have a pet conspiracy theory?
362680	375160	No, maybe not that I would imagine is outlandish enough to be entitled that, but yeah, no,
375160	376160	I'm sorry everybody.
376160	380320	What do you think that we're getting away with right now?
380320	383320	What?
383320	387680	I feel like you, Spencer, I can't even see it right now because Dan's saying it the
387680	388680	way.
388680	389680	Don't worry.
389680	390680	I feel your presence.
390680	391680	They put my mic here and this is where I'm supposed to stand.
391680	392680	It's for the cameras.
392680	396600	Spencer, are you saying that you think that everything's fine, that there's no conspiracies
396600	398760	in the world, that we're not getting away with anything?
398760	401280	Well, I mean, I'm sure there's lots of conspiracies.
401280	403320	I just don't know about them.
403320	407700	Like I mean, there's corruption all over Asia, right?
407700	410780	Just in the government?
410780	413120	Like there could be called conspiracies.
413120	415480	I mean, I don't have specifics.
415480	416480	Give me some Asian corruption.
416480	417480	They won't lay some Asian corruption.
417480	421320	Well, I mean, like Chinese officials, they just bribe people and they do housing projects.
421320	423420	And I mean, there's just illegal stuff.
423420	425280	Like you read about it, right?
425280	436120	If you like Asian corruption, getting caught in the rain.
436120	437120	I'm a syllable guy.
437120	438120	I like syllables.
438120	442120	I like to notice when things will fit like that.
442120	443120	All right.
443120	444120	So, okay.
444120	445120	So game changer.
445120	446760	I already talked it out in the green room.
446760	450160	Here's a new segment called, I talked it out in the green room.
450160	461520	It's not gonna be as filled with joy and it's gonna trickle down to you and you'll be bored.
461520	463440	The VR technology is here, Jeff.
463440	465400	It's here.
465400	466400	It's here.
466400	467400	It's here.
467400	470720	It's the valve, valve has won.
470720	475920	They have crossed the finish line in the first like leg of the race to have consumer level
475920	477680	VR be amazing.
477680	483120	Like I just finished, I came from Justin Roylan's house and he has like the, one of those valve
483120	484120	things.
484120	485120	He's like a developer for it.
485120	486120	A valve?
486120	487120	A valve.
487120	493080	Valve is a video game company that they've always been like on the bleeding edge, Jeff.
493080	494680	The bleeding edge.
494680	495680	Not the leading edge.
495680	497680	The bleeding edge.
497680	503560	Their edge was razor sharp and caused a lot of bleeding now.
503560	507240	We've gotten to the point because of virtual technology, their edge is now bleeding.
507240	509520	Like they don't even need to cut things anymore.
509520	510680	That's when you're so far out in front.
510680	511680	There's nothing to cut.
511680	514120	Well, then make the edge bleed.
514120	516640	Aye, aye, captain.
516640	518400	I trust him with my life.
518400	521520	That's the ship they're running at, valve.
521520	523400	They've always been there.
523400	525280	This is not a paid statement.
525280	526280	Like I...
526280	527280	It sounds like it.
527280	531160	Well, tough titties for Walter Middies.
531160	539120	Now, Dan, explain who Walter Middie is for these people.
539120	540120	They know.
540120	541120	It's Ben Stiller.
541120	542120	Okay.
542120	543120	Okay.
543120	544120	They know.
544120	548040	Can that be the episode title?
548040	549040	You guys don't know.
549040	552960	That movie's based on an old Viewmaster reel.
552960	560200	So, I'm just saying like, okay, I've tried all the other shit, and I'm not going to name
560200	565800	names because, like, there's going to be a fucking thug-like war between these VR companies
565800	567640	and like, Valve's going to win.
567640	574880	I put on the goddamn helmet, and I was fucking in a virtual reality.
574880	575880	It's not what...
575880	580960	I mean, you've all put on the things where you're kind of like, ow, it hurts my brain,
580960	585640	but I guess I'm kind of in a Swiss villa.
586640	591000	And I've tried everything, and I walk out just feeling awkward and embarrassed because
591000	596280	it's still like the 90s, and it's like, okay, yeah, I guess what you've accomplished here
596280	601160	is you have figured out a way to make a plastic helmet that has the equivalent of an iPhone
601160	607280	in front of my face so that when I look through it, I can experience an app that you created.
607280	609480	It's terrible, and you walk out feeling really sad.
609480	612240	Really sad for all the people that spent billions of dollars.
612240	616080	There's children starving in probably Asia, for sure, right?
616080	617080	Yeah.
617080	619560	All the officials are taking their foods.
619560	628080	Then you put this shit on, and it's like putting a sock on your head, but if... that's a bad
628080	631680	metaphor.
631680	632680	It's over, Jeff.
632680	633680	It's over.
633680	634680	We've crossed the new threshold.
634680	635680	Was there a game that you played?
635680	636680	There was a lot of things I played.
636680	637680	They have, like, these little sample things.
637680	645800	One of them is you're standing in a kitchen, and I'm telling you, you make soup.
645800	646800	That's not a lie.
646800	648000	I'm telling you, that's what you do.
648000	649000	You make soup.
649000	652400	The whole time you're making soup, you're like, get the fuck out of here, because it's
652400	658840	like the fridge and the microwave, and you're like just fucking jamming shit with your hands.
658840	661720	There's a thing that's like, you need to make soup, and it's like, two carrots have got
661720	664640	to go in, and you're like, there's the carrots, and there's another carrot.
664640	666920	You can fucking open the fridge with your other hand.
666920	667920	You can't carry it.
667920	669240	You drop it in the pot.
669240	670240	You make soup.
670240	671740	Can you make soup wrong or right?
671740	674800	Is there a way to measure whether you made the soup right or wrong?
674800	679400	You don't put the right ingredients into whatever container requires that thing being made.
679400	683240	But then, yeah, after a while, you take the pot and you try throwing it at the robot that's
683240	689480	telling you to make soup, and it hits it, and you're like, Jesus Christ.
689480	690480	It's not even a game.
690480	691480	There's no score.
691480	692480	There's no countdown.
692480	693480	There's no pressure.
693480	696800	I sit on an iPad, and I play games where I'm like, Natalie's diner.
696840	697840	You gotta make a sandwich.
697840	701800	And I'm like, you know, Aaron's like, dude, it's four in the morning.
701800	705520	Don't you have a shut the fuck up?
705520	709640	Like I've almost earned chopsticks.
709640	710960	This is like crazy.
710960	712960	Like, like, like, like, like.
712960	718040	Is there a verifiable way that they say, okay, you made the best Reuben of all time, or you
718040	719040	fucked it up?
719040	720040	Just guys.
720040	721040	I don't know.
721040	722040	No, it's not that.
722040	724560	It's not far enough along, Jeff.
724560	725560	You're thinking.
725880	731400	You're interpreting what I'm saying to you as if the reality of making a sandwich is
731400	732440	like there.
732440	733440	It's not that.
733440	736800	It's simply sandwich making, but it's not about the quality of the sandwich.
736800	741640	It's about your ability to interact with an actual virtual environment in a way that has
741640	743840	only previously been done in like movies.
743840	744840	So walk me through this.
744840	748520	So you see like a stack of bread, like slices of bread.
748520	749520	It's soup.
749520	750520	Soup.
750520	751520	No, it's fine.
751520	752520	You don't just make soup.
752520	753520	It's a cold kitchen.
753960	754960	Okay.
754960	756160	So let's say you see a carrot.
756160	757560	You can walk over and grab a carrot.
757560	758560	You grab the fucking carrot.
758560	759960	And do you chop the carrot up?
759960	762520	Well, you know, I bet you could, but I didn't.
762520	763520	It doesn't.
763520	764520	I mean.
764520	766120	Why didn't you chop the carrot?
766120	770280	You see, you feel like you're, you're, you're investigating a soup simulator as if like,
770280	774040	you're like, wait, if you can't chop it up, what I'm telling, I'm, I'm, I'm, the reason
774040	775040	I told you.
775040	776040	This sounds like a soup simulator.
776040	777040	I want to know why.
777040	780160	Like, like, but I'm telling you the thing that's going to blow your mind is it has nothing
780160	783600	to do with how accurately it simulates making soup.
783600	787120	I'm saying you make soup.
787120	788120	You dig?
788120	792400	Like, it doesn't matter if it's not like, like making soup.
792400	794680	It's like you make soup.
794680	795680	N-word.
795680	802600	First of all, don't drop an N-bomb on me while I'm talking about carrots.
802600	807840	But that's the only word that could possibly express like my, to probably punctuate my.
808840	810800	What is the, how specific do you get?
810800	812960	Like, you grab an onion and do you cut the onion?
812960	814360	You just drop it in a pot.
814360	816800	I'm telling you, it's no more sophisticated on the level of.
816800	819040	Dropping an onion in a pot is not making soup.
819040	822480	This guy, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, this is the thing.
822480	826400	This is the crazy thing about it is it's not, it's like, like.
826400	828040	But you're, you're a Minecraft guy.
828040	831560	Wouldn't you like to be able to chop up and like, like, like get rewarded for dicing the
831560	833240	onion perfectly or, or not?
833240	834240	Like, no.
834240	837600	Man, Minecraft is like low phi and high function.
837600	840760	That's exactly, thank you for proving my point.
840760	842480	For wandering into my demon's lair.
842480	843480	I don't know.
843480	844480	I don't play these games.
844480	845480	Anyways, whatever.
845480	846760	What's, what's the controller?
846760	847760	Is it your body?
847760	851200	Right now it's still just like Wii sticks basically like, but they have their own.
851200	852200	Okay.
852200	855040	But they can easily, it's just a matter of expenditure, you know, like, like they can
855040	860280	easily make, like, you know, easily, like based on what you're doing, like, it's like
860280	863880	really cheap, like fucking glove that you could like grab the carrot.
863880	864880	But you just.
864880	865880	And it's real.
865880	866880	It's a real carrot.
867640	869160	I picked up a knife and I went like this.
869160	871160	You're dropping a carrot.
871160	873680	See, that's what I'm talking about.
873680	874680	And I kept doing it.
874680	876440	And I was like, I was scared.
876440	879120	I was like, what if it, what if blood flies out?
879120	880120	Right.
880120	881120	That's what I meant.
881120	883160	When you hold the knife, what is the knife's function?
883160	884720	Is it an actual, can you chop?
884720	886720	I probably could have chopped carrots, yeah.
886720	887720	Okay.
887720	888720	I bet.
888720	889720	That's possible.
889720	890720	I didn't try.
890720	891720	I was in there five minutes and then they put me somewhere else and then they put me
891720	892720	somewhere else.
892720	893720	Shit is crazy.
893720	896600	But your first instinct was to see whether or not you could slit your own throat with
897320	898320	a knife.
898320	906040	But see that if you have a real knife and you hold up to your throat, you should just
906040	907040	pass out and die.
907040	908040	Right.
908040	909040	Right.
909040	917760	That would be one of the many great applications of virtual reality is loopable suicide.
917760	920760	Yes.
920760	923760	I mean, believe me, we're, we're, we're coming up on crazy days.
923760	925560	Like, like, we're going to, we're going to go right.
925560	926560	Talk about whiplash.
926560	930320	I go from the days of, and I'm not making fun of anybody for, I'm not, I'm not, I'm
930320	933920	not one of these, the guys that's like, I was one of these guys and now I'm not.
933920	934920	I'm old and I'm tired.
934920	937880	I accept your triggers and your, and your sensitivities and everything.
937880	938880	I love you.
938880	941960	I support you in, in watching a TV show and being affected by it.
941960	943480	The TV show hurt me.
943480	944480	Dear diary.
944480	945480	I got hurt.
945480	946480	Okay.
946480	947480	Now I'm making fun of you.
947480	948480	You know what?
948480	949480	You said you wouldn't do it.
949480	954560	I'm making a little bit of fun of you.
954640	960640	That's because my dad hit me in front of Cheers.
960640	966680	I didn't, I was like, I don't watch Cheers and be like, okay, nevermind.
966680	968080	I'm sure your dad hit you too.
968080	973240	Were you ever, were you ever hit in front of like iconic TV or was it always down in
973240	974240	the basement?
974240	980800	Like, it was, there's so many, so many, there was a Napoleon bobblehead going, and that's
980800	983960	why I, and I tried, like, I still got a C minus in French history.
983960	985080	I didn't complain.
985080	990000	So we're going to, we're, I'm just saying we're going to do this like whip thing because
990000	995960	it's like, it's like, holy shit, dear, dear Hannibal season two, like I was triggered
995960	997160	by this thing and blah, blah, blah.
997160	1001240	And then it's going to be like, listen, man, like you can do one of eight things when you
1001240	1005040	put this helmet on, like you get, you, there's like going to be lots of ways to just hang
1005040	1009920	out in there and just be like, I'm a big, like a sea otter, like bouncing a, a bouncing
1010000	1011240	ice cream cone with my belly.
1011240	1016040	But then it's, you know, there's going to be a lot of just stab, stab, stab, or like,
1016040	1017400	here's a map of my school.
1017400	1027640	I don't like, like, like when people are like, yeah, that's what I'm saying to you.
1027640	1029600	You're not reacting to me.
1029600	1032520	We're reacting to the future.
1032520	1037400	Just to make that clear, like, like, and it's going to get, that's true.
1037400	1041240	It's going to get crazy as the kids say.
1041240	1042960	They add A's now.
1042960	1044160	All right.
1044160	1045880	So I've, I've, I've already talked too much.
1045880	1049760	I had the, I had the, well, I did that and then I had the worst Uber driver ever.
1049760	1051320	Uber, Uber corner.
1051320	1052320	Uber corner.
1052320	1053320	Shit.
1053320	1054320	I can't play.
1054320	1055320	I like it.
1055320	1056320	All right.
1056320	1057320	Can't work like this.
1057320	1060320	He's just a bad Uber driver.
1060320	1071360	And I can't, I can't, the theme's, what was his name or her name?
1071360	1073200	I don't know.
1073200	1074200	Step notes.
1074200	1075720	He would, he wouldn't pick me up.
1075720	1080600	I was standing outside the oyster bar and because I was, I walked from Justin's construction
1080600	1082360	all over Sherman Oaks.
1082360	1085720	So I walked to a place where there was no construction to call an Uber.
1085720	1090080	I wasn't going to try to make anybody navigate construction with their Uber.
1090080	1092760	That wasn't, that wasn't my goal.
1092760	1093960	I took the hit.
1093960	1095360	I walked to a place.
1095360	1096360	I sat down.
1096360	1097360	I ordered a drink.
1097360	1098840	I leave only footprints.
1098840	1100040	I don't hang out.
1100040	1101040	I don't loiter.
1101040	1102280	I don't abuse Uber drivers.
1102280	1104160	I don't do anything to make anyone's life difficult.
1104160	1105320	I float on the wind.
1105320	1110920	I'm, I'm, I'm Forrest Gump's feather.
1110920	1116000	And word again, the second, the second time that was necessary.
1116000	1118480	So I call the guy and then I, it says your Uber's here.
1118480	1119680	I go out in the sidewalk.
1119680	1122560	And by the way, the fact that I had to go out in the sidewalk meant I had to pay $20
1122560	1127680	because I had to, he came so fast that I was like, oh shit, I will, I'll just have to
1127680	1131080	leave a 20 and let him keep the change $20 drink.
1131080	1135760	So I'm already all revved up.
1135760	1137400	I'm out on Moorpark and it's hot.
1137400	1140120	And I'm like, and I'm like, well, it says he's here, but he's not here.
1140120	1144080	I mean, there's like, it's nothing but fucking because of the construction.
1144080	1145080	Like it's easy.
1145080	1146080	God damn it.
1146080	1150360	And the guy calls me and he, and it, and it's just like, it, you just hear music in
1150360	1151360	the background.
1151360	1156000	I'm not doing any ethnicity of music at all.
1156000	1164280	Like, like, it was just like blanket, just like fucked up, like unmarketable mishmash.
1164280	1168440	That could have been a white guy at the end.
1168440	1172360	And, and, and when you left me last night, it was Habibi.
1172360	1173360	Okay.
1173360	1174360	Okay.
1174640	1178120	Well, but when you left me last night, that narrows it down, but that was cockazite on
1178120	1179120	the front end.
1179120	1180120	All right.
1180120	1181440	You can't pin me down.
1181440	1182440	You left me.
1182440	1184080	I don't know what country this guy came from.
1184080	1185800	You left me last night because of Habibi.
1185800	1192960	Well, you left me last night because Habibi, beautiful red dress Habibi.
1192960	1200600	I think that guy might be from Cincinnati, certainly by way of Syria, racist.
1200600	1207720	I say Habibi when there's a fish special.
1207720	1208720	No, you fucking don't.
1208720	1211680	I'm like, I'm like fucking, it's like, it's like saying, it's like saying like, like,
1211680	1213680	like, like, uh, Mazel tov.
1213680	1214680	Okay.
1214680	1215680	I say that sometimes.
1215680	1218280	I'm, you know, I don't give a fuck.
1218280	1222680	I'm a fucking, I'm a white privileged conqueror, assimilate everybody.
1222680	1225480	I'm like, I'm like, L'chaim, fuck it.
1225480	1226480	Salute.
1226480	1227480	Yeah.
1227480	1228480	Fuck you.
1228480	1229480	Fucking.
1229480	1230480	Salute.
1230520	1231520	Salute.
1231520	1232520	Salute.
1232520	1233520	Salute.
1233520	1234520	Salute.
1234520	1235520	Salute.
1235520	1236520	No, salute, like an Italian.
1236520	1237520	Oh, salute.
1237520	1238520	Racist again.
1238520	1239520	Can't tell Italians from Muslims.
1239520	1240520	All right.
1240520	1241520	So you call the guy, it's like, uh.
1241520	1245960	And he keeps going like, I'm not, I'm not, I'm like, I can't, are you at the oyster
1245960	1246960	bar?
1246960	1250240	And I'm, and I'm going like, yeah, I'm outside the oyster bar and he's like, I'm more park.
1250240	1251840	And I'm like, yeah, I'm more park.
1251840	1254760	And I'm standing on more park and he's like, but you're not here.
1254760	1259920	And I'm like, you're not here.
1259920	1262000	You're not here.
1262000	1264440	And he's like, no, you're not here.
1264440	1272720	And the music's like, I was born on the 4th of July, habibi.
1272720	1276120	And I'm like, arguing with the guy is like forever and I'm going like, like, so you're,
1276120	1277840	and I look at the map and it's like mission impossible.
1277840	1280400	I'm like, I'm zooming in on your location, sir.
1280400	1281960	I can see your cartoon car.
1281960	1286240	Are you situated behind all the way behind the oyster bar?
1286240	1289600	And he's like, he's like, I love oyster bar, more park.
1289600	1292480	Like mad at me, like, like, like, he's like trying to get through to me.
1292480	1294400	And I'm like, I'm, I'm on more park.
1294400	1295720	I'm outside the oyster bar.
1295720	1296840	I see your car.
1296840	1299640	I think you're in the parking lot behind oyster bar.
1299640	1304200	And while that would not normally be an issue, it's basically a block away from me because
1304200	1305960	you're in the fucking parking lot.
1305960	1307600	And it's like, it's Sherman Oaks.
1307600	1310640	Like they did the, I can't just like cut around.
1310640	1314520	I don't, just trust me, go there, take pictures.
1314520	1317960	So eventually I'm like, you're in the parking lot and he's like, and then finally he act
1317960	1318960	exasperated.
1319120	1321600	Are you in the parking lot of oyster bar?
1321600	1324840	I'm like, no, why would you, do I look like a car?
1324840	1328240	You're not, you know, like, why would I go into the parking lot?
1328240	1329440	I don't have a car.
1332120	1334840	Do you think that this is how I react to my car being stolen?
1334840	1336280	I'd be like, oh shit, my car's gone.
1336280	1337640	Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
1337640	1345160	Like, like, no, I would walk out onto more park, call an Uber, go and I walk and I go.
1345160	1350440	And then the guy was like such a sassafras, uh, because he was like, he, now you're racist.
1350440	1356600	Well, because I got in and so he goes, he goes, uh, uh, he starts driving and he's
1356600	1359840	like, I cannot park on that street, there's construction.
1359840	1364320	And I was like, I took, because I know I walk there, there's no construction.
1364320	1365320	Like I didn't say anything though.
1365320	1366320	Say it again.
1366320	1368640	I said, would you walk there to the oyster bar?
1368640	1369640	Because there's no construction.
1369640	1371600	I already took that fucking hit.
1372320	1375440	If I wanted to hear about fucking construction, I'd go, fuck Justin's house.
1377080	1378120	Why are your teeth so good?
1378120	1379200	Because I'm fucking angry.
1379200	1380480	What are you fucking dumb?
1382200	1384680	I've never heard that character before where you, where you talk with your.
1384680	1386240	It's fucking anger being restrained.
1386240	1387960	So I don't say something with my whole mouth.
1387960	1388880	What do you want to say?
1388880	1389960	I want to fucking circle.
1389960	1391120	Let it out, let it out.
1391120	1392520	Flip my throat with a virtual knife.
1394440	1399280	So he's driving, so he goes, so he pulls one of these and one of these, this is like, this is,
1399280	1401080	this is a new one for me.
1401160	1404520	He's like, he's driving and he goes like, oh yeah, I kept plugging the thing.
1404520	1406960	And then I'm like, okay, sure.
1406960	1409360	And I just pulled a Jodie Foster on him.
1409360	1418720	And by that, I mean, I looked out the window at a world more important than him and chose
1418720	1422960	to atone with it for all the pain I've been through, like rather than I'm not going to
1422960	1423960	stoop there.
1423960	1424960	And so.
1424960	1430680	Find a camera, find the camera and turn the light on and give me your Jodie Foster.
1431120	1432480	That camera's with the red light there.
1432480	1433480	Okay.
1433480	1434480	All right.
1434480	1437000	Here's the Jodie Foster if you're outside my car window.
1437000	1438000	Okay.
1438000	1442000	Now let me do it again.
1442000	1443000	Let me do it again.
1443000	1445320	That looked like somebody set off a cherry bomb outside the car.
1445320	1446320	All right.
1446320	1448760	Let me do it again.
1448760	1449760	Okay.
1449760	1450760	All right.
1450760	1452760	Can we move on?
1452760	1453760	We got it.
1453760	1454760	We got it.
1454760	1456520	So, so the, the.
1456520	1457760	Jodie Foster's wrapped.
1457760	1462840	So he goes, he goes, I pick you up there before, no.
1462840	1466080	And I said, no, not the oyster bar, no.
1466080	1468680	Or he said, he said, I drive you before, yes.
1468680	1469680	That's what he said.
1469680	1473200	And I said, I said, I said, maybe I'm like, you're bald.
1473200	1474200	Like I don't know.
1474200	1475200	I don't know what to go by.
1475200	1480360	And he's got, and he's like, and many times from there and I'm like, no, not the oyster
1480360	1481360	bar.
1481360	1482360	No.
1482360	1483360	And he's like, yeah.
1483360	1484360	Yeah.
1484360	1487080	He was like, like, oh, I was like, oh, really?
1487080	1488480	You pick me up at the oyster bar a lot?
1488480	1489480	He's like, yeah.
1489480	1490480	Yeah.
1490480	1491480	What?
1491480	1493560	How, how does he think he's going to get through this debate?
1493560	1498360	Like, I said, oh, really?
1498360	1500440	So tell, am I a doctor?
1500440	1501440	He's like, what?
1501440	1502440	I'm like, what?
1502440	1503440	Where do I, where do I work?
1503440	1507240	Tell me some more shit about myself.
1507240	1508240	But I didn't say it like that.
1508240	1511760	I was like, I said, tell me some more shit about myself.
1511760	1513200	And he did the scariest thing I wrote.
1513200	1514560	He's like, I'm sorry, buddy.
1514560	1515560	I'm sorry.
1515800	1519040	I felt like, oh, my God, like the Eastern European guys on the wire.
1519040	1521640	He's going to kill me.
1521640	1523000	I'm scared of Eastern Europeans.
1523000	1524000	Racist.
1524000	1525000	Fine.
1525000	1526000	But fine.
1526000	1530760	I would rather, I would rather be killed by any other ethnically identifiable group in
1530760	1533240	the world before an Eastern European.
1533240	1534800	Why?
1534800	1535800	The wire.
1535800	1536800	What?
1536800	1537800	What?
1537800	1538800	Which?
1538800	1543720	From my extensive experience as a born identity.
1543720	1548480	What kind of person would you, would you, if you had to pick the first person to kill
1548480	1549480	you, who would it be?
1549480	1553520	I feel like, honestly, I'm going to go with good old fashioned black guy.
1553520	1554520	Good old fashioned black guy.
1554520	1555520	Yeah.
1555520	1556520	Because I feel like they're not.
1556520	1557520	Describe him.
1557520	1558520	What's he wearing?
1558520	1559520	What does he look like?
1559520	1560920	No, this is not fair what you're doing to me.
1560920	1562120	I'm saying.
1562120	1565720	You said that you, you, you, you think.
1565720	1571040	I'm saying as far as like, I'm running through my like, like, simulators of if you're getting
1571040	1577480	killed by an ethnic person, like, and like, why are you like, what is that death like
1577480	1578480	consisting of?
1578480	1584080	I'm going to go with the black guy over the, the Eastern European is like way, like, I
1584080	1588240	don't want to, I feel like I would be in a warehouse and like, like, according to everything
1588240	1592640	I've seen, they, first you wake up and they're like, and they're like, hello, hello, big
1592640	1593640	boy.
1593640	1596280	And I'm like, what the fuck?
1596280	1597280	What the fuck?
1597280	1598280	What the fuck is going on?
1598280	1600800	And they're like, you take my fucking money.
1601560	1603160	And you're like, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
1603160	1610920	And then there's like a crocodile and they're pouring concrete, like, wait, wait, what do
1610920	1612160	black people do when they kill you?
1612160	1613160	Hold on.
1613160	1615160	Tell me about the crocodile in the concrete.
1615160	1617240	I don't fucking know how you just scream.
1617240	1623560	And then like, they find your body and David Cruz is like, looks like crocodiles eat two.
1624560	1625560	Okay.
1625560	1631720	So that you don't want to be, you don't want to die by Eastern European guy, but you want
1631720	1632720	to die by black guy.
1632720	1633720	Cause how do you think that's going to go?
1633720	1636920	Like what's, what's the best way that you get killed by black guy?
1636920	1640920	I'm, you're, I'm, you're trying to, you're trying to make me sound racist.
1640920	1645920	So I'm going to, I'm trying to escape that news and say, I'm not saying that you get
1645920	1646920	to pick.
1646920	1648320	We're talking about pop cultural deaths.
1648320	1651440	How do, how do white men die in movies?
1651440	1655400	And then so I will take one of the, and the answer is if killed, there's probably a chart
1655400	1661760	like if killed by black man in movies, white man dies, how it's not by machete.
1661760	1665400	It's not by like, like, like he's like, you know, redwood forest and he hears his wife's
1665400	1669400	voice that even though she's been dead for 10 years, and then he has to like to see Satan
1669400	1672200	and his fucking pores explode with heroin.
1672200	1679640	Like if you statistically on a, on a bar graph of one race killing another in movies, if
1679640	1683760	a white guy dies by a black guy, it's like a stray bullet.
1683760	1684760	A stray bullet.
1684760	1685760	Yeah.
1685760	1689320	Or so it's like, or it's like Patrick Swayze or something that's like, I love my wife so
1689320	1690320	much.
1690320	1691320	Hey man, give me your money.
1691320	1692320	Hey, let's be reasonable.
1692320	1694840	Oh, oh, I love my wife.
1694840	1695840	Okay.
1695840	1697000	So it's easy.
1697000	1698000	It's easy.
1698000	1699000	It's soft and easy.
1699000	1700000	It's like, it's like Shakespearean.
1700000	1703640	I just showed my pen lights up.
1703640	1704640	Okay.
1704640	1710840	So Dan, you get to write your own death, uh, like, like play along with me here.
1710840	1712280	It's a death by another person.
1712280	1713280	It could be a man.
1713280	1714320	It could be a woman.
1714320	1715320	It's one person.
1715320	1716320	What race?
1716320	1717320	You get to pick.
1717320	1718320	I get to pick the race?
1718320	1719320	Yes.
1719320	1720320	The black guy.
1720320	1721320	Okay.
1721320	1722320	We did this.
1722320	1723320	Okay.
1723320	1724320	But how do you want that death to happen?
1724320	1728440	Like you, you get to pick, you die because somebody else kills you.
1728440	1729440	It could be a man or woman.
1729440	1731080	You've already picked black man, right?
1731080	1732080	Right.
1732080	1733080	Right.
1733080	1734080	You can pick a black woman.
1734080	1735080	Okay.
1735080	1736080	Well, you, you, you.
1736080	1737080	I like that.
1737080	1738080	That's good.
1738080	1739080	I deserve that.
1739080	1740080	You can pick anything.
1740080	1742080	I deserve that more.
1742080	1743480	I like black women.
1743480	1744760	How would you like to die?
1744760	1748800	You get to pick the race, the gender, the whole thing.
1748800	1749800	You get to.
1749800	1750800	Okay.
1750800	1756360	Well, then I guess I'm at the bank and, uh, I'm like, uh, here's my golf fund.
1756360	1760880	And then, um, and then she comes in and she's got a big afro and she's like a, like a olive
1760880	1761880	jacket.
1761880	1764240	And she's like, you know, like, like, like, like hot.
1764240	1767200	And like, and she, and she's like, free suckers.
1767200	1773000	This is a holdup for the 1970s.
1773000	1775360	And I'm like, like, like easy, easy.
1775360	1779320	And then, and then, um, she's like, like, but then I can see like, there's humanity
1779320	1780320	in her eyes.
1780320	1783960	Like, like, like, like, because, because, because, because she gets fucked over because
1783960	1786520	she's just like, this ain't your money.
1786520	1788720	She pulls a, she pulls a totally smooth robbery.
1788720	1789920	Like she's got it down to a science.
1789920	1793520	She's like, oh, y'all's money is, uh, no, no, that sounds terrible.
1793520	1798400	That was, I didn't mean to do the, I didn't mean to do bad grammar, uh, oh, y'all money
1798400	1799400	isn't sure.
1799400	1800400	It was the y'all.
1800400	1801400	It was the plural on the y'alls.
1801400	1802400	It sounded terrible.
1802400	1803400	All y'all money is insured.
1803400	1804840	This ain't your money.
1804840	1806240	It's the government's money.
1806240	1807240	They fucked you over.
1807240	1808440	Now I'm fucking them over.
1808440	1811360	So keep your goddamn head down and you won't get it blown off.
1811360	1814000	And I'm like, she sounds like she knows what she's doing.
1814000	1818040	And then she's filling her bag and then somebody just pulls some crazy shit on her.
1818040	1823480	Like the, the, the bad honky, like, like, like he hits the alarm and he shouldn't hit
1823480	1824480	the alarm.
1824480	1826520	Who do you cast as bad honky in this?
1826520	1827520	Dabney Coleman.
1827520	1828520	Okay.
1828520	1832440	And then, and then it's like, and he did it and he did it and he's, and she's like, why
1832440	1833440	did you do that?
1833440	1834440	Why did you do that?
1834440	1837840	And, and, and, and, and I don't know what happens at that point, like, like she gets,
1837840	1838840	she gets shot.
1838840	1843440	Like Dabney Coleman's got like a little fucking asshole gun and then she gets, she gets shot
1843440	1846440	but then something happens and I don't have time to write the whole thing, but it like
1846440	1849920	basically it ends up with me and her in the bank vault.
1849920	1850920	Right.
1850920	1854640	And because I somehow, it's like, it was kind of like a dog day afternoon meets like Cadillac
1854640	1861000	man, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, what do you call it, a Stockholm syndrome
1861000	1862000	kind of like thing.
1862000	1868040	But it's like, like she and I, we were, we end up like, we, we solve everything in those
1868040	1870960	dark days before we die together.
1870960	1871960	Because she has to tell me.
1871960	1872960	How do you die though?
1872960	1877320	She has to, I mean, I have, I'm picking this cause she, I died by black woman.
1877320	1878320	So she has to kill me.
1878320	1879320	Right.
1879320	1880320	Under what circumstances?
1880320	1881320	Third act.
1881320	1882320	How do you?
1882320	1886720	I guess right at the end I reveal myself to be like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm sorry, you
1886720	1887720	can't trust me either.
1887720	1889040	And then she shoots me.
1889040	1890040	All right.
1890040	1891040	That feels bad.
1891040	1894640	I don't want to, I don't want to be selfish, but I'd rather she has to kill me because
1894640	1897880	I like, oh, oh, oh, oh, I know why.
1898880	1899880	Because I helped her.
1899880	1904800	I aided and abetted her and like, and I'm like, there's nothing in my insurance policy
1904800	1907880	about treason.
1907880	1908880	Do it.
1908880	1910000	Do it for my wife and kids.
1910000	1913920	And she's like, I can't do it, Mr. Harmon.
1913920	1916680	And I'm like, don't you ever fucking call me Mr. Anything.
1916680	1920480	You fucking awesome black woman.
1920480	1924320	And she's like, you fucking unexpectedly wonderful white man.
1925320	1928320	And I'm like, just fucking shoot me.
1928320	1929320	And it goes black.
1929320	1934120	And then it's just like fucking Aaron Sorkin.
1941120	1942840	So that's a good death.
1942840	1948080	I don't want that to, I don't want that to be misperceived as an invitation of any kind
1948080	1949440	to black women across America.
1949440	1950440	It's too late now.
1950440	1951440	It's already out there.
1951440	1955080	Spencer, Spencer, how would you die if you could pick a way to be murdered by another
1955080	1956080	human being?
1956080	1957240	You have to pick race and gender.
1957240	1958240	That's what I'm interested in.
1958240	1960240	Oh, who is your murderer?
1960240	1961840	Or it could be, it could be an animal.
1961840	1962840	It could be a woman.
1962840	1963840	It could be a man.
1963840	1964840	It could be anything.
1964840	1965840	I'm going to keep it Asian.
1965840	1969560	I'm going to go with sumo sumo wrestler would be awesome.
1969560	1970560	Whoa.
1970560	1976800	But he just ripped, like he just ripped my head off my body, but walk us through how
1976800	1977800	that goes down.
1977800	1978800	Why?
1978800	1979800	All right.
1979800	1987000	I'm at the supermarket looking at frozen vegetables.
1987000	1994440	And I, I bump into, I bump my cart into someone's cart and I go, oh shit, sumo wrestler.
1994440	1996080	And he's not having it.
1996080	1997320	And I'm like, I'm sorry, man.
1997320	1999640	I'm just trying to get some peas.
1999640	2001720	And he's like, I'm trying to get something.
2001720	2002720	And I ask what?
2002720	2004800	And he says, your head.
2004800	2006560	And then he just rips off my head.
2006560	2007560	All right.
2007560	2008560	All right.
2009320	2010320	All right.
2010320	2011320	All right.
2011320	2019440	Well, our next guests are no strangers to racism.
2019440	2021040	These are actually really old friends of ours.
2021040	2023800	A lot, I bet a lot of people would be surprised how long we've known these guys.
2023800	2028760	We don't hang out every day, but, but, but our, our connection goes way back to pre YouTube
2028760	2030280	days and channel one on one.
2030280	2036280	I hope they don't want to know they're not trying to keep their age secret, right?
2036280	2041320	Because unless they were 11 back then, who boy are we old?
2041320	2044720	But they were, they were part of this amazing troop that was doing early, like channel one
2044720	2047240	on one, New York stuff, the human giant.
2047240	2050720	The other guy was Aziz and he went, you know, I mean, one thing I want to talk to these
2050720	2053320	guys about is that they're, they've never, I don't know.
2053320	2058280	That's like, like that, that troop, like it never goes like, okay, we're Simon and Garfunkel.
2058280	2060960	We're going this way or that way, or we're breaking up or we're reuniting.
2060960	2065440	As far as I know, they've, they kind of all have all individually like done amazing stuff.
2065440	2070000	We've got two of them here tonight promoting a, that makes it seem crass that they're here
2070000	2071000	promoting something.
2071000	2072400	They're just here.
2072400	2075320	If they promote something, it's on accident.
2075320	2079040	But they, they're, they just finished working on something, a concert movie that we'll talk
2079040	2080040	about too.
2080040	2088200	So let's welcome some old friends of mine and some new friends of yours, Mr.
2088200	2089200	That was good.
2089200	2090200	That was really good.
2090200	2093600	I've been looking for a standard intro like Duncan Trussell has.
2093600	2095600	You choke him in the back, but that was actually really good.
2095600	2098360	No, no, that's why I laughed because it was so good.
2098360	2105280	I was like, Oh, wow, say it again, but say it was like, like, throw it away.
2105280	2107880	Like, like, do it, like, do it like you, like that means nothing to you.
2107880	2112560	So please give an H-town welcome for some old friends of mine and new friends of yours,
2112560	2114280	Mr. Paul Scheer and Rob Hubel.
2123600	2136960	I'm watching the live stream backstage and just thinking it would be great if there was
2136960	2143320	a thermometer reading on the live stream just to see how the temperature is treating everybody
2143320	2144320	here.
2144320	2145320	Well, you don't need one.
2145320	2150840	You have a, the equivalent of a mercury bird, like, are you saying, because I was like,
2150840	2152640	I was just thinking, I'm pouring sweat.
2152640	2155240	Oh, I, I did a show here earlier today.
2155240	2158400	I poured sweat, I stopped and now I've come back to pour sweat again.
2158400	2159400	This is it.
2159400	2160400	This is my workout for the week.
2160400	2161400	Thank you.
2161400	2163880	I don't, I don't sweat at all.
2163880	2165720	I'm tired of having to explain to these guys.
2165720	2167800	It's six degrees colder out there.
2167800	2170120	I'm not just, I'm not just a balloon.
2170120	2176280	You're the reverse, you're the reverse Letterman Letterman keeps the studio cool, like 60 degrees.
2176280	2178800	You jacket up to 107 degrees.
2179800	2181800	All right, so let's dig in.
2185800	2186800	What?
2186800	2187800	Wait.
2187800	2188800	All right.
2188800	2192560	Rob, you are, you have to pick a way you're going to die, but Paul has to be the one that
2192560	2193560	kills you.
2193560	2197000	You get to pick the circumstances and the way that he dispatches you.
2197000	2200520	How do you let Paul share, murder you?
2200520	2202520	First of all, great question.
2202520	2206400	I've given this a lot of thought, actually.
2206400	2209720	Is it something, do I have to be aware of it before it happens or can it be sort of
2209720	2210720	like a sneak attack?
2210720	2213760	You get to pick, also it could be when you're 90 years old, it could be tomorrow, it could
2213760	2217520	be five, when you're five years old, it could be anything you want.
2217520	2218520	You have to die.
2218520	2223600	When he was five years old, so he can go back in time and kill himself.
2223600	2227440	He gets to pick how he dies, but it has to be at Paul Shear's hand.
2227440	2228440	How do you like to go out?
2228440	2231000	So my time traveling back, like a Terminator?
2231000	2232000	It's up to Rob.
2232000	2233000	All right.
2233000	2234000	I just want to get that.
2234000	2237560	When he does time travel back, is he totally nude?
2237560	2243720	See, this is why I ask, because I feel like that's where you want us to go.
2243720	2244720	Right.
2244720	2248520	So you get to pick, not only do you get to pick how Paul kills you, you get to pick what
2248520	2249960	he's wearing or what he's not wearing.
2249960	2252080	Oh, it sounds like he has to be nude and five years old.
2252080	2253880	Well, I mean, yeah.
2253880	2255680	I would love a five-year-old Terminator.
2255680	2260880	That would be the best version of the new Terminator, just like a really bad ass kid.
2260880	2262840	All right, I think I got it.
2262840	2263840	Rob, you got it?
2263840	2264840	Yeah.
2264840	2268600	I think it was my birthday when I was seven years old.
2268600	2273360	My parents had this really sort of homegrown birthday party for me where they had like
2273360	2275120	my little friends come over.
2275120	2280520	And I don't know why they did this, but they made a ton, a shit ton of like mashed potatoes.
2280520	2282800	And we were all like in our swimsuit.
2282800	2286200	This sounds very erotic, but we were all like in our...
2286200	2288680	Wait, a birthday party with tons of mashed potatoes?
2288680	2289680	Explain.
2290120	2295440	I'm fucking hard as a fucking diamond right now.
2295440	2299760	So we were all in our little swimsuits and everyone had a spoon and it was just like
2299760	2300760	a food fight.
2300760	2304240	Like it was just like someone, you know, like go and we all just fucking threw a shitload
2304240	2305880	of food at each other.
2305880	2310280	And it was just like the simplest, dumbest, happiest I've ever been.
2310280	2315040	So I think that if Paul Scheer showed up at that moment...
2315040	2316040	Naked.
2316040	2317040	Naked.
2317040	2318040	As a five-year-old?
2318040	2320480	No, as an adult, I think.
2320480	2321480	Yeah.
2321480	2322800	Like current Paul, right?
2322800	2327440	Yeah, current Paul, full throttle, like super hard.
2327440	2330160	Well, and...
2330160	2333280	I mean, yeah, as long as no metal was exposed, I could probably time travel.
2333280	2336880	But now as an adult, I do have a metal rod in my penis.
2336880	2338080	To keep it hard all the time.
2338080	2341840	So a metal would prevent you from time traveling?
2341840	2344200	It's not like at the fucking airport.
2344200	2347600	That's always been the weird thing about Terminator.
2347600	2349280	It was good enough for the first Terminator movie.
2349280	2350280	It was kind of cool.
2350280	2351800	It was like, well, why would he look like Arnold Schwarzenegger?
2351800	2354320	And the reason is because living...
2354320	2355320	The living tissue.
2355320	2356320	Yeah, covered it up.
2356320	2359680	But then after you were 11, you were like, well, but come on.
2359680	2362920	Yeah, he's still a giant robot underneath there.
2362920	2363920	Yeah.
2363920	2364920	Like, why would that matter?
2364920	2365920	Why don't you just like...
2365920	2366920	Yeah.
2366920	2367920	Well, in this last movie, his hand is ripped off.
2367920	2372360	He's like, oh yeah, I can't time travel because now you can see it.
2372360	2373360	I believe you.
2373360	2374360	Really?
2374360	2375360	Yeah.
2375360	2376360	Are you fucking kidding me?
2376360	2378080	He's got to wait around for 30 years.
2378080	2382840	That's how the Terminator gets older, is he's like, I'll wait here.
2382840	2383840	And then...
2383840	2386480	How did this get off of little kids in bathing suits with mashed potatoes?
2386480	2389200	How did we get off of that?
2389200	2390200	Can we fucking...
2390200	2391200	Can we stick to one part at the moment?
2391200	2392200	Sorry.
2392200	2393200	Yeah, sorry.
2393200	2394200	We said no tangents.
2394200	2395200	We said no tangents.
2395200	2396200	No tangents?
2396200	2397200	No tangents.
2397200	2398200	For the whole show or just this question?
2398200	2401200	That's the rule of Harmon Town is no tangents.
2401200	2405760	Mashed potato, birthday party, I'm there as a naked adult, rock card.
2406120	2407120	You said that, not me.
2407120	2412640	What I would like to not see it coming, I would like for you to just sort of materialize
2412640	2422240	behind me with a fucking huge hatchet and just fucking slice me down the brain.
2422240	2426200	My parents and everyone's like, what the fuck?
2426200	2431280	But it would be a service to me because my life wasn't going to get any better than that.
2431280	2432280	No.
2432280	2433780	Not at all.
2433780	2434780	So thank you.
2434820	2441020	Do you guys think that they, I was going to say they say, I don't know who they are, but
2441020	2445860	I heard somewhere and it was probably an eighth grade history teacher that the guillotine is
2445860	2449140	like the most humane execution we've come up with so far.
2449140	2450140	That's what they say, right?
2450140	2456020	Because the speed that it goes down, all you feel is a, who knows this?
2456020	2457020	Who studies this?
2457020	2460020	But by the way, you feel a coldness on the back of your neck and then it's done.
2460020	2465580	I feel like that, if we ever did that though now, it would be viewed as the most inhumane.
2465580	2466580	Oh yeah.
2466580	2467580	Well, it looks terrible.
2467580	2468580	Well, they also say-
2468580	2471700	The thing we do to them, lethal injection is like, you know, it's terrible.
2471700	2472700	They're experiencing a terrible thing.
2472700	2476220	I've also heard that drowning is like pretty fucking cool.
2476220	2477220	Really?
2477220	2478220	No.
2478220	2479220	Are you serious?
2479220	2480220	No fucking way, man.
2480220	2481220	I thought it's just like-
2481220	2482220	I'd rather burn to death.
2482220	2483220	Oh.
2483220	2484220	Oh, water.
2484220	2488220	You know, and it's just like, well, but what about the, what about the writhing?
2489220	2494860	For me, if I had to pick firing squad all the way, firing squad, I want drums.
2494860	2495860	I want dudes.
2495860	2496860	I want guys and-
2496860	2497860	That's fucking insane.
2497860	2498860	And I think you're lying.
2498860	2501820	I want Claude Rains to be out there in front and then go, do you have any less words?
2501820	2504300	And I'm like, up your butt with a coconut.
2504300	2507820	And then they put the blindfold on me and they would shoot me.
2507820	2511720	And then have bolts of lead fly through the air at the speed of sound to go into random
2511720	2512720	parts of your body.
2512720	2517980	Have you ever seen firing squad footage of people dying that it goes, boom, and the person's
2518740	2519740	head goes, and that's it.
2519740	2521740	They're fucking, they're clearly dead right off the bat.
2521740	2522740	No way, man.
2522740	2525860	Isn't the whole thing about the firing squad that only one person has a bullet, but they're
2525860	2526860	all aiming at your head?
2526860	2527860	No, no, no, no, no.
2527860	2528860	It's the other way around.
2528860	2532180	There's a blank that everyone gets to assume is there.
2532180	2534740	You might have the blank, so you might not have been the one.
2534740	2535740	Oh, God.
2535740	2537740	I like your way better though.
2537740	2539660	Just like, one guy just sucks.
2539660	2540660	Fuck.
2540660	2544700	You shot him in the shoulder, you asshole.
2544700	2549060	You always get to go home at night from your work a day job on the firing squad.
2549060	2551060	How was work today, honey?
2551060	2552060	I had the bike again.
2552060	2553060	I had the bike in there.
2553060	2558940	Oh, sweetie, that's great because you know how much my parents disapprove of your job.
2558940	2562540	Yeah, tell them three weeks and running.
2562540	2565540	I guess I'm just born for this job.
2565540	2568860	Please stop telling your parents what I do for a living.
2568860	2571500	Each firing squad guy has on the door of his locker.
2571500	2579140	They all have the blank days since the last fatality, a sign, and all of them say 500,000
2579140	2580820	because they all keep insisting they have those.
2580820	2581820	They're all super lucky.
2581820	2584220	Each one of them, you're like, yeah, I just always get the blank.
2584220	2585220	I don't know.
2585220	2586220	Sure you did, Tony.
2586220	2587220	Sure you did.
2587220	2590900	And then Kevin walks away and is like, it was me.
2590900	2594780	They all go to PF Chang's afterward and they just like, they joke about, you guys killed
2594780	2595780	so many people.
2595780	2596780	No, you did.
2596780	2597780	I never have.
2597780	2598780	Me neither.
2598780	2606100	The bullet fairy visits one of them in the middle of the night.
2606100	2610340	It's like a Christmas carol, but for executioner and like you did kill all these people, let's
2610340	2611340	look at their lives.
2611340	2613660	And then you were, you know, then you kill yourself at the end.
2613660	2616580	It's a really dark Christmas, but there's a, but then you get the blank.
2616580	2617580	Yeah.
2617580	2622380	Then you get the blank and then you live the best life ever.
2622380	2628740	I still think a great way to die would crackin would be death by crackin, death by crackin.
2629580	2631860	I was going to say a base jumping accident.
2631860	2635340	Like if you've seen any of those documentaries where they're in the, like those squirrel
2635340	2640820	suits just going like 600 miles an hour, not, not, not actual squirrels, but like you mean
2640820	2641820	like the flag.
2641820	2642820	Yeah.
2642820	2643820	There's wing suits.
2643820	2644820	Yeah.
2644820	2645820	They're not dressed like squirrels.
2645820	2649820	Well, they look sort of like squirrels, but no, specifically, yeah, they do look like
2649820	2650820	squirrels.
2650820	2651820	Like, yeah.
2651820	2656100	And they go like real close to like the terrain and every now and then there's just like a
2656100	2659340	guy that just, it's just like fucking pink mist.
2659340	2664820	It's just like, it's just like just pink mist.
2664820	2666740	That's just like terrible.
2666740	2667740	There's so fast.
2667740	2668740	There's our band name.
2668740	2669740	That's so disturbing.
2669740	2670740	Pink mist.
2670740	2671740	It's just so fast.
2671740	2680220	I think that's the title of the episode, refreshing pink mist, the effervescent, the good people
2680220	2686060	of the Coca-Cola corporation have captured the flavor and impulsiveness of an extreme
2686060	2689420	sports man, aerosol misting.
2689420	2691260	It will shoot your head right off.
2691260	2692260	All right.
2692260	2696140	Now, Paul, Paul, you said Kraken, if you could, if you could either die or kill somebody,
2696140	2701580	but the magic was involved, you could be the murderer, like, okay, how about this?
2701580	2705620	You get to kill Dan Harmon because you have to, because maybe he's going to do some terrible
2705620	2706620	things.
2706620	2707620	Okay.
2707620	2713820	You, you have to kill Dan Harmon because he's going to throughout history be one of the worst
2713820	2714820	people that ever existed.
2714820	2715820	Sorry.
2715820	2719020	I could do a whole concert about how I want to get killed by a black woman, for instance.
2719020	2720020	Really?
2720020	2721020	All right.
2721020	2722020	Yeah.
2722020	2723020	So if you want to stop that, you better kill me.
2723020	2726220	Now you, now you, you live in a world, Paul, where there's magic, you have spells, you
2726220	2728460	can do anything you want or you could be as crude.
2728460	2732540	It could be a, it could be a nighttime attack with a, with a, with a bottle opener.
2732540	2735700	You could do anything you wanted or there could be magic spells.
2735700	2739220	How, well, if you, well, my first instinct, I'm going to go with my first instinct here.
2739220	2744540	When you said magic, I said voodoo dolls don't get enough play in this world.
2745260	2749900	And I think that would be a real fun way to get in someone's head where they don't know
2749900	2753580	what's going on, but their hands like, and you could have them choke themselves.
2753580	2755140	You could light that on fire.
2755140	2759340	You can make them walk, you know, into, into a wall.
2759340	2760700	I never understood that science.
2760700	2761700	Yeah.
2761700	2764340	Like in the Disney movies, when they eventually they're taking the doll and going like that
2764340	2767300	and the guy's like moonwalking, but it's like, well, wait, how come every time you move
2767300	2769300	it around, he doesn't like float around?
2769300	2771740	I guess you have to activate it in some way.
2771740	2772740	Yeah.
2772740	2775660	I think, I think a voodoo doll and you could prolong it a little bit.
2775660	2776660	You can make it a little bit.
2776660	2780220	So what, what, how do you start toying with the voodoo doll and then how do you finally
2780220	2781220	finish the job?
2781220	2787420	Well, I think in the beginning it would just be simple slaps in the face and just a general
2787420	2790500	like, this is a total Adam Sandler movie.
2790500	2795700	Oh, then I would get a remote control that would control your life.
2795700	2799740	I fast forward, rewind 50 nights in Haiti.
2800740	2802740	Why is that over?
2802740	2806060	That was the weirdest groan I've ever heard in my life.
2806060	2809700	Well, because I think people know, oh, something bad happened in Haiti.
2809700	2814380	They don't, they're even though that's years ago and then, or every day to the point where
2814380	2818380	lately, I mean, who's, who's, who's going to Haiti this week?
2818380	2820940	I don't know what they think is the worst part as an audience.
2820940	2826780	You all didn't, you all like, oh, too soon, too soon to rag on an Adam Sandler movie or
2826820	2827820	no, they like that.
2827820	2829820	It was the word Haiti.
2829820	2834420	They reacted to it like it was like a, you know, building seven or something.
2834420	2837420	Me and my building seven, no reaction, not even a bad one, like, yeah, yeah, well, look
2837420	2838420	it up.
2838420	2846220	So, yeah, I think, I think you would start to build the craziness in with the slaps weird
2846220	2847220	things.
2847220	2849540	Like all of a sudden you're laying in bed and you're like, shoot up and like, I don't
2849540	2850940	know why I can't lay down.
2850940	2858540	It's a really, a week full of just funny, weird slapstick and then, you know, walking
2858540	2859940	into walls and stuff like that.
2859940	2865420	And then I think it would be, I would, I would light a fire and then I'd put it on ice and
2865420	2870660	I think those sensations, I'd go to sensations, a lot of sensations and then, and then to
2870660	2871660	talk about drowning.
2871660	2872660	Now, is Dan?
2872660	2876180	So if you had to kill me, you'd torture me.
2877180	2882580	Well, look, we're talking about you're a pretty evil guy and I want to make sure you get your
2882580	2883580	just deserve.
2883580	2886140	I don't want to make sure that, you know, I don't want to make it easy on you.
2886140	2890340	If you were like, I have to kill you to save the life of a child, yeah, guillotine.
2890340	2895660	But if you're going to be like the next, whatever, you know, Boko Haram, I need to make sure that
2895660	2896660	you take, get that.
2896660	2897660	From Haiti?
2897660	2898660	Ooh.
2898660	2899660	Yeah.
2899660	2907940	So then I would, then I think the final thing would submerge, submerge the guys.
2907940	2911420	I don't understand why me being more evil requires me to suffer longer.
2911420	2914060	Don't you think that you would want to suffer?
2914060	2915860	You're saying, but you didn't even know what I've done yet.
2915860	2919900	First of all, Dan, we're learning is the Dan counterpoint.
2919900	2921340	How do you, how do you kill him?
2921340	2922340	He's a torturer.
2922340	2923340	How do you kill?
2923340	2924340	How do you kill Paul Cher?
2924340	2928740	I, it's hard to not just do another voodoo doll on him, you know, so that whenever I
2928740	2937740	feel like my knee get hot, I can pull out it and go like, like yank on his dick or something.
2937740	2941540	And then slow down the yanking and make it more gentle to the extent that the heat on
2941540	2943540	my knee was more comfortable.
2943540	2945860	Then we'd find a, we'd find an understanding.
2945860	2952580	I mean, but let's turn this into a win, we can just, we can just go to restaurants together
2952580	2962020	and just, now that, now that's an Adam Sandler movie in Haiti.
2962020	2967980	It's called Haiti's going to hate.
2967980	2968980	Nobody grown that.
2968980	2969980	Wow.
2969980	2972140	But there should be a company that does that.
2972140	2976300	I don't get why there isn't like, if you find out that you're dying, like there should be
2976300	2978820	a company that says like, okay, well, like, how do you want to die?
2978820	2981060	Like you want to get fucking eaten by a bear.
2981060	2982060	Great.
2982060	2984060	Like, yeah, we'll set it up.
2984060	2985060	Like whatever you want.
2985060	2986060	You want to be shot in like a drive-by?
2986060	2990100	I would like to be like, but when you want to, like in a way, I think this is maybe a
2990100	2991140	Dennis Leary bit.
2991140	2995820	So Dennis Leary, Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll, I'll give this to you, but why don't you
2995820	2996820	use these people?
2996820	3005180	Were you just doing a shout out to an FX show?
3005180	3008740	I think his name in that show is like Steve Rock and Roll.
3009740	3014020	His last name is pretty amazing.
3014020	3017500	I would do it like you would just go out like in a stunt from Fast and Furious.
3017500	3018500	Like that would be great.
3018500	3019860	Like sell your body to a movie bag.
3019860	3020860	Yeah.
3020860	3023820	You fucking get to drive Vin Diesel's car through those buildings in Abu Dhabi.
3023820	3026060	Like that would be, I would go out like that.
3026060	3029100	You could arrange to have an on-screen fatality.
3029100	3030100	Yeah.
3030100	3032220	And that they would put it in the movie.
3032220	3033220	Exactly.
3033700	3043220	So it's just all old people that are ready to die jumping out of cars.
3043220	3050460	You put on your new headstone, there's a video screen, like an Afford Explorer, and it's
3050460	3055820	just like a loop of the fucking Ferrari going through.
3055820	3058700	But then people can start going, well, shit, let's make like a Milo and Otis movie with
3058700	3062020	old people.
3062020	3064380	Because they had to kill like a million dogs and cats to make that movie.
3064380	3068540	That would be the story of two old people crossing the country to get back to their
3068540	3069540	owner.
3069540	3073140	And then it's just like an old lady in a box going down a river and go, whoa, help me.
3073140	3077180	And it's like, you can see the different actors in each cut, in each shot.
3077180	3078180	It's like, wow, 45.
3078180	3079180	I love that.
3079180	3080180	I'm in.
3080180	3081180	Yes.
3081180	3084220	Hollywood, make that happen.
3084220	3086380	All people were hurt during the making of this film.
3086380	3087380	Everyone.
3087740	3090740	And then there's like a gray ribbon or whatever the symbol for it is.
3090740	3091940	It's like they wanted to be.
3091940	3092940	Yeah.
3092940	3093940	They wanted to go out.
3093940	3095740	They're tired of being dicked around by pharmaceutical companies.
3095740	3099500	And they were like, can I be in a kick ass movie with Vin Diesel about me fucking braving
3099500	3100500	the rapids?
3100500	3101500	Yeah.
3101500	3104100	Be the best.
3104100	3107460	Were there really a lot of cats and dogs killed in the making of it?
3107460	3108460	Apparently.
3108460	3110940	I haven't looked it up on Snopes, but I do believe, I mean, that is the...
3110940	3112580	You have to believe it.
3112580	3116140	It was like a, I think it was a Japanese like, like production or something like that.
3117140	3119140	There's got to be a Milo and Otis expert in here, right?
3119140	3122460	Well, I also heard that Dudley Moore would strangle a dog every time he did voiceover
3122460	3123460	work for it.
3123460	3124460	Do you mind coming up?
3124460	3125460	Well, you had...
3125460	3126460	Well, two.
3126460	3130660	We've got two guys and one was sitting right next to each other.
3130660	3133580	Let's bring them both up and they both have to come up.
3133580	3135180	Let's let the first guy...
3135180	3136180	His hand was up first.
3136180	3137180	No, you sir.
3137180	3138180	Yes, please.
3138180	3139180	If you're willing.
3139180	3140180	Okay, great.
3140180	3144340	And if he's, you know, like, we'll let you mean genome like a professional wrestler.
3144340	3146060	Take the chair from your beard, sir.
3146100	3147100	All right.
3147100	3149300	So what have you heard about Milo and Otis and what do you know?
3149300	3150300	First off, what's your name?
3150300	3151300	Adam.
3151300	3152300	Hello, Adam.
3152300	3153300	All right.
3153300	3154300	Nice to meet you, everybody.
3154300	3155300	Let me regale you all with the heartwarming...
3155300	3156300	Did you get everybody's name?
3156300	3157300	Yeah, you sir.
3157300	3158300	You sir.
3158300	3163180	Yeah, this was messed up, especially because I love this movie when I was a kid.
3163180	3167420	And then you grow up and you find out that this Japanese company, not only did they like,
3167420	3170700	literally the scene where the cat like falls out, they were just taking cats and just throwing
3170700	3172540	it off this cliff just to get this shot.
3172540	3174540	And you see the cats like, ah, no, I'm good.
3174540	3175540	Do it again.
3175700	3176700	Wait, what do you mean you see?
3176700	3181260	You see in the movie, you see the cat falling off the cliff and it's like, literally what
3181260	3184780	they did was they just took live cats and threw them off a cliff till they got the shot.
3184780	3185780	But you heard that.
3185780	3186780	I just want to like track down.
3186780	3191340	Yeah, I heard the same thing, but do you know how credible is that information?
3191340	3196420	It's Dudley Moore, who did the voiceover for it, admitted that it's one of his biggest
3196420	3199260	regrets that he was a part of the project when that came out.
3199260	3201340	Like not as like...
3201340	3206460	It is still, there's still a sliver of possibility that Dudley Moore was simply told as same
3206460	3208740	as I was, because he wasn't there.
3208740	3213860	It's like, Dudley stand in the bushes and be the voice of the cat and he's like, oh,
3213860	3216940	what are they doing over there?
3216940	3223700	By the way, I think if he was to look back at the mass execution of cats and dogs and
3223700	3228740	Arthur too, maybe he would think, Arthur too on the rocks, maybe, hey brother, can you
3228740	3229740	spare a billion dollars?
3230540	3232540	That's a sign on the poster.
3232540	3237380	But yeah, I'm not trying to investigate or debunk you.
3237380	3242660	I'm just curious because I hear it and then I go, I never know the...
3242660	3245780	We thought you worked for like the ASPCA.
3245780	3248740	Sometimes I spread shit and then later I look it up and I'm like, I've been spreading this
3248740	3253620	shit for three years and I want to like...
3253620	3254620	Take it all back.
3254620	3255620	Yeah, and I can't.
3255620	3256620	And I can't.
3256620	3257620	It's out there.
3257620	3261620	It's a Japanese production company killing me for defaming their credibility.
3261620	3262620	You know what?
3262620	3266460	The fact that it wasn't made in the States makes me think that definitely animals died.
3266460	3270300	I don't know how many, but I just feel like, yeah, they didn't care.
3270300	3272300	There's no ASPCA.
3272300	3279780	I've heard anecdotal stuff under the subheading of that legend, whatever, if it's true or
3279780	3280780	not.
3280780	3281780	Okay, we got a...
3281780	3282780	We love Harman Town.
3282780	3283780	It's like a town meeting.
3283780	3285780	We got a research department in the audience.
3285780	3287540	That's an AV club article.
3287540	3289100	Yes, animals were harmed.
3289100	3292260	21 films and TV shows that killed or hurt animals.
3292260	3294500	Oh, luck killed a bunch of animals.
3294500	3295500	That's HBO.
3295500	3298500	Note number one is electrocuting an elephant, 1903.
3298500	3302060	Okay, snobs.
3302060	3303060	Of course.
3303060	3304340	That was Anderson, of course.
3304340	3307660	And then stagecoach and Ben Hur, as you might imagine, Jesse James, okay.
3307660	3309440	Ben Hur, a fucking guy dies.
3309440	3310780	They keep it in the picture.
3310780	3311780	Heaven's Gate, 1980.
3311780	3315340	I just heard that, you know...
3315340	3317900	This is a comedy show, right?
3317900	3319380	It used to be.
3319380	3322020	We went down after dead animals so hard.
3322020	3327780	I gotta say, Haiti definitely started us off on the wrong place.
3327780	3330460	Man, it's your naked man killing a five-year-old with a hatchet, though.
3330460	3331460	That was me.
3331460	3335180	I mean, did you pull this up, sir, because Milo Notis was on this list?
3335180	3336180	Because I'm a...
3336180	3337180	Who's just fact-checking?
3337180	3338180	Who's fact-checking?
3338180	3341740	There's no relevance to Milo Notis in this article.
3341740	3344180	Oh, the Adventures of Milo Notis is number 21.
3344340	3348060	All right, originally released in Japan in 1986, the Adventures of Milo Notis depicted
3348060	3353100	the best buddy's relationship, but as cute as the film is, it's been dogged by rumors
3353100	3354500	of animal cruelty with...
3354500	3356540	Dogged by rumors.
3356540	3361140	A-minus, A.B. Club.
3361140	3364540	Just like all my best episodes.
3364540	3365540	Fucking A-minus.
3365540	3366540	Motherfucker.
3366540	3368260	They can't give it up.
3368260	3369260	They can't give it up.
3369260	3371540	They're very hard to grade.
3371540	3372780	You know what got an A?
3372780	3374020	My last episode.
3374020	3375780	They were like, yeah, get out of here.
3375780	3380020	All right, particular emphasis on the claim that 20 kittens were killed in the course
3380020	3382060	of filming, though the...
3382060	3383340	These are still describing the rumors.
3383340	3386100	Though the rumors were never substantiated, animal rights activists point that the film's
3386100	3391100	end credits don't use the standard American Humane Association claimer, but instead a
3391100	3396220	more vague, the animals used were filmed under strict supervision with the utmost care for
3396220	3399140	their safety and well-being.
3399140	3401140	And their interment.
3401140	3406220	Regardless of off-screen abuse, a lot of what made it into the film meets any reasonable
3406220	3408300	definition of animal cruelty.
3408300	3409940	That's a good point.
3409940	3414100	Even on screen, even if they use the same cat and dog, it's like, Jesus Christ, man,
3414100	3417220	they don't work them that hard.
3417220	3420380	While some of the more harrowing scenes were cut for U.S. audiences, others remained, like
3420380	3424020	the one in which the cat plunges more than 100 feet off a cliff into the ocean.
3424020	3425620	Other controversial scenes include...
3425620	3426620	But there's not...
3426620	3427620	There's no...
3427620	3428620	No one knows.
3428620	3429620	There is no...
3429620	3430620	It's dying with those Japanese filmmakers.
3430740	3434820	It's the last one on the list, and they don't say that there's no reference to it either.
3434820	3438780	The one that I want to look at is, I remember as a kid, and I've only been able to see images
3438780	3444780	of it online, Benji at Marine World, and they put Benji in a wetsuit and then submerged
3444780	3446500	him, made him dive.
3446500	3454500	So he's wearing an old-school 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea kind of helmet, like a circular
3454500	3460060	fishbowl helmet, and he's in his own wetsuit diving, and I'm like, well, I know this dog
3460060	3467140	is underwater, and I don't think that wetsuits for dogs are a thing, so I'm guessing this
3467140	3470140	is inhumane.
3470140	3471140	What was your name again, sir?
3471140	3472140	Sorry.
3472140	3473140	Adam.
3473140	3474140	Adam.
3474140	3475140	And what...
3475140	3476140	Oh, shit.
3476140	3477140	Sorry.
3477140	3478140	The...
3478140	3479140	Is there...
3479140	3481660	Do you think you have a line to any more information than Adam had?
3481660	3485340	There's a couple more stories about it, but like you said, everything's just still
3485340	3486340	kind of...
3486340	3487340	Okay.
3487340	3488340	So still unsubstantiated.
3488340	3489340	But what was your name, just so we can...
3489340	3490340	Ben.
3490340	3491340	All right.
3491340	3494340	Well, thank you, Ben and Adam, for being our Milo and Otis correspondent team.
3494340	3506460	I wouldn't put that credit on your resume, though, like, Harmon Town, Milo and Otis expert.
3506460	3508540	Well, let's hope...
3508540	3509540	Let's hope...
3509540	3512580	You know, because Rob pointed out, I think it was Shrob, he's like, yeah, there's that
3512580	3517060	scene where it's part of the story that one of the animals hurts their leg and they're
3517060	3518060	limping.
3518060	3523820	And it's like, how do you train a puppy to limp where the hammer is how?
3523820	3531740	I have worked with numerous animals and none of them can be trained.
3531740	3535020	They only have owners that promise you that they will be able to be trained.
3535020	3536020	Oh, yeah.
3536020	3539180	And then they're like, I don't know why they're not doing it now.
3539180	3542900	They were doing it great yesterday.
3542900	3545980	Heat Vision and Jack, like, Jack gets out of the jail cell because there's a German
3545980	3551860	Shepherd and the joke is he's so smart, he can talk German Shepherd through a dog whistling.
3551860	3554300	And it's like, yeah, the guy comes in with the German Shepherd and he's like, this is
3554300	3558100	Bucky and I was like, okay, well, because the button that says on the script that the
3558100	3561460	dog does all this shit and the guy's like, here's the three things Bucky could do.
3561460	3564860	And then, yeah, he's like, and I've been working with him all week on that one thing, but okay,
3564860	3565860	let's try it.
3565860	3566860	Oh, all right.
3566860	3567860	Nope, nope, nope, nope.
3567860	3571780	It will really work if I'm in front of the dog and I have my hand on his head and I'm
3571780	3572780	in the shot.
3572780	3573780	Will that work for you guys?
3573780	3576540	Absolutely not, because that's not the way filming goes.
3576540	3581420	We can't have this dude who just appears to be training the dog in the scene.
3581420	3584660	That's why in TV shows it's always like if the dog growls, it's like yawning, but then
3584660	3585660	there's like a roar.
3585660	3593180	We shot a thing on the league with a monkey and the guy was in a car, the monkey got loose
3593180	3599980	in a car and he goes, don't worry if the monkey starts biting the, whatever, the sun visor.
3599980	3600980	He likes that.
3600980	3601980	We're like, all right.
3601980	3607020	He goes, bud, if he starts biting you, just give him these gummy bears and it will be
3607020	3608020	fine.
3608020	3609020	Just reward him.
3609020	3614460	I was like, that's, I wouldn't give that to a child who's being hyper.
3614460	3618700	Why would I then like provoke the monkey and then also give him something that's in the
3618700	3620700	form of a human?
3620700	3626740	I wouldn't want to, the most important thing being like, if he bites me, don't defend myself.
3626740	3627740	Yeah.
3627740	3629980	Like give him a treat.
3629980	3636220	If he reverts to his savage animal instincts and is following no programming whatsoever,
3636220	3642740	I should elevate my understanding of everything in the universe and like not react primarily.
3642740	3647100	On Children's Hospital, we shot this thing with a baboon and a fucking baboon.
3647100	3648100	They're so scary.
3648100	3653620	They have like the biggest fucking fangs and they brought her in and she was dressed up
3653620	3658140	like Megan Mullally's character, so she was wearing like a little lab coat and glasses.
3658140	3659500	The baboon was?
3659500	3660500	The baboon was, yeah.
3660500	3664740	And so they had her in this chair and she was just at this desk and she was just supposed
3664740	3665740	to type.
3665740	3668340	Like the joke was that we didn't know that that was not Megan Mullally.
3668340	3671420	Like we thought like, oh, chief, blah, blah, blah, you know, we start talking to her and
3671420	3672620	we just didn't know.
3672620	3678020	And so the trainer, they put her in this chair and she would just type.
3678020	3683540	She would just go like, like on a typewriter, but like a fucking maniac, like with such
3683540	3691060	like fucking hatred and like anger at the world and like, and uh, and they told us like
3691060	3694620	right before we rolled, it was me and Offerman, me and Offerman were supposed to be like questioning
3694620	3698180	the monkey, like leaning right into her face and they go, oh, uh, yeah.
3698180	3701460	Don't look at her because that's, that's aggressive.
3701460	3703180	So don't look at her.
3703180	3705660	You know, you can, you can look towards her, but don't look at her.
3705660	3710460	And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what is the difference between fucking looking
3710460	3715380	towards this animal and looking at it because like, I don't want to get my fucking face
3715380	3721700	like ripped off and like shat in and yeah, hand it back to me.
3721700	3726300	Back in New York, when we used to do stuff in New York, I believe Seth Herzog brought
3726300	3732460	a monkey on stage for a bit, like at a comedy show and the monkey ripped his earlobe off.
3732460	3736020	These fucking things are animals.
3736020	3738780	They look like people, but they're animals.
3739020	3743620	They'll rip their face off and rip up your balls and then they'll eat your hands off.
3743620	3748860	And that's not all cause they're animals, but they're animals that understand your private
3748860	3749860	parts.
3749860	3754940	Um, they, they rip it like, like a dog, a dog doesn't go right for your fucking nuts,
3754940	3757340	but it's like, I know exactly what you are.
3757340	3761020	I have 99% identical to you genetically and I'm angry at you.
3761020	3763420	I know I've, I've, I've, I am DB'd you.
3763420	3766100	I'm going for the parts of you that get you fast.
3766100	3767380	It's really low hanging fruit.
3767380	3774300	It's like blah, they go for your face and your fucking fingers and your genitals.
3774300	3776580	Well, they go for what you'd go for.
3776580	3784500	If you have the passion, like because if you weren't so lazy, this is what you would do.
3784500	3788420	Well they, um, I remember I talked to an animal trainer who had an orangutan and I was like,
3788420	3789860	Oh, was it like working with them?
3789860	3796180	And he goes, well, my, my trainer, my, my master trainer had an orangutan and he, uh,
3796180	3800340	and he goes, you have to, you know, once they become older, they get more stubborn and you
3800340	3804100	have to start to watch out for these signs and he goes like, he was missing his mark.
3804100	3806940	He wasn't doing his thing and they used to live together.
3806940	3810500	And he said, you know, I'd always say, he'd always sell a monkey, like get me a beer and
3810500	3811500	the monkey would get him a beer.
3811500	3813220	And then the monkey would have a beer.
3813220	3817540	He goes, but one day he said, get me a beer and the monkey didn't get him a beer.
3817620	3819540	He's like, it's now it's time.
3821140	3824260	He goes, he walked him out into the backyard and shot him in the back.
3826020	3833460	No, no, because he said that because, um, I believe it was an orangutan that when they
3833460	3838580	get to a certain age, like the, their headaches, like, um, actually grows or something like a,
3838580	3842420	a part of bone in their head kind of pops out and then they cannot be trained anymore.
3842420	3845780	Then they're not, they are, they are off the grid.
3845860	3849860	So you're like, and because they are domesticated and off the grid,
3849860	3850900	they're doubly fucked.
3850900	3853940	So it was like the only humane thing was to shoot them murder.
3853940	3854260	Yeah.
3854260	3860020	But I love a Miller's crossing with an orangutan just walking them out and pop.
3860020	3862660	And not because he didn't break his leg in a horse race.
3862660	3863700	Like that's sad enough.
3863700	3865380	It's like, thank you for racing and making up.
3865380	3866260	No, it's like, you've gone.
3866260	3868260	It's like, you wouldn't give me a beer.
3869300	3870500	You became sentient.
3872180	3873460	You are not my saving.
3873940	3877380	You started to evolve.
3877380	3878500	You were evolving.
3878500	3880980	This was a, this was a guy is a train.
3880980	3884900	This is a, uh, an animal trainer who's master trainer.
3884900	3889700	Like he, he apprenticed under this guy and told the story very casually.
3889700	3893780	It wasn't like a, it wasn't like, oh, and he told me like 10 other amazing stories.
3893780	3894900	He just took him out and shot him with a gun.
3895940	3896500	He said like this.
3896500	3901940	He goes, he walked him out in the back with a gun and so I imagine that means she knows.
3902020	3903380	That could mean a lot of things though.
3903380	3904180	That could mean a lot.
3905380	3907780	Dan, Dan, was it Jim or Joel Hodgson that told us?
3908660	3912100	I love Lancelot Link, uh, that show was a chimpanzees.
3912100	3913620	And I think it was Joel Hodgson, right?
3913620	3916500	Harmon who told us that he knows the people that did that show.
3917060	3918420	And there was this chimpanzees.
3918420	3923620	If you don't know Lancelot Link, secret chimp, it was a show where it's like a James Bond kind of thing.
3924340	3925460	It's very funny.
3925460	3929700	And there was the, uh, the evolution revolution was the band and the chimpanzees playing drums.
3929700	3930660	It's very fun.
3930660	3934980	However, we found out from our friend, Joe Hodgson from mystery science theater, uh, fame
3935780	3940980	that part of, uh, training those chimps was daily taking them out behind the fucking set
3940980	3946580	and beating them with a pipe and like beating them into submission because these chimps,
3946580	3949940	at some point they get aggressive and they're like, I don't want to do this anymore.
3949940	3954740	And they're very muscular, very aggressive when they want to be.
3954740	3958420	And they would have to take them out and beat them within an inch of their fucking life,
3958420	3966900	like all the time to get them to go put a tuxedo on and pretend their wardrobe just
3966900	3976020	kept getting more and more elaborate to cover up all of the tuxedo on that.
3976020	3977060	They're like, God damn it.
3977700	3979460	I told them, it's told Cindy to take this in.
3979460	3980660	It makes me look like a fat ass.
3981620	3985620	If that guy beats me with a pipe one less time, I'm not putting it on next time.
3985620	3987780	I just, I don't know.
3987780	3992740	I don't know why that made me, I just think he alone in a trailer with a black guy.
3993620	3994340	It's like terrible.
3994340	3995140	It's a terrible job.
3995140	3995300	Yeah.
3995300	3995780	Yeah.
3995780	3998900	But then you hit him with the pipe and then you're like, no, go to your dressing room
4000420	4002100	and dress like a fucking witch doctor.
4003060	4009220	And he's like, I'm in and on and humping and got the latch on the back.
4009220	4010100	But that's not funny.
4010100	4012900	If you're listening and you're an animal, they said, yeah, well, I'm not, yeah,
4012980	4014020	everyone's an animal person.
4014020	4014260	Yeah.
4014260	4015380	We're just close to each other.
4015380	4019700	I saw on Facebook that thing where elephants are painting and the elephant draws a painting
4019700	4022420	of an elephant that is fucking a better elephant that you could draw.
4022420	4024020	And be like, well, that's a fucking amazing.
4024020	4030660	I didn't know an elephant could put a paintbrush in its trunk and draw a fucking perfect elephant
4030660	4031220	and do it.
4031220	4034820	It turns out the way they do that is through torture and through lots of like,
4034820	4035300	what?
4035300	4036980	The people walk up to them and hold a thing.
4036980	4038980	They hold them by the air in their hands as a nail.
4039700	4041860	And it's, and there's little sticks they have.
4041860	4045060	It doesn't look like it, but what they're doing is they're just jabbing them with like,
4045060	4046580	it's all through pain.
4046580	4047780	They've learned to do this shit.
4049780	4050980	But are the paintings good?
4053460	4054740	I mean, they're beautiful paintings.
4056500	4058420	I would buy one of these paintings.
4058420	4064740	Yeah, I would like a movie version of the fugitive with a monkey being like,
4064740	4070740	he killed a trainer and he's like, I had, you know, a wrongly accused monkey being chased down.
4070740	4075620	I was tired of playing the Baron and putting a monocle in and writing a tricycle.
4075620	4079780	And, uh, yeah, I, yes, yes, I killed my trainer, but it went price entertainment.
4080500	4080740	Yeah.
4080740	4083140	And, but now he's a monkey with, without a fucking home.
4083940	4090820	June, my wife, uh, is very adamant about monkey and monkey rights because she doesn't like that
4090820	4095300	monkeys are portrayed in a way that they have no control over.
4095300	4099620	So in the movie called monkey shines, a monkey is a killer.
4099620	4103940	And she's like, well, that's not fair to the monkey cause he can't choose his roles.
4103940	4108820	And so he shouldn't, he shouldn't be portraying his race.
4108820	4111460	He shouldn't be portraying his race by doing this.
4111460	4117060	Like you're forcing him into a role that is maybe not defamatory to his race.
4117060	4118820	June is June is paranormal.
4119460	4124100	Uh, empathic because when I did your awesome podcast, how did this get made,
4124100	4125300	which everybody should listen to.
4125300	4126180	Thank you so much.
4126340	4132340	Uh, she was very sincerely like, like, like, like, like Jack Frost with Michael
4132340	4132660	Keaton.
4132660	4135300	Like she, there was a point where she was crying.
4135300	4135540	Yeah.
4135540	4136100	She cries.
4136100	4137060	She cries a lot.
4137060	4141940	And, uh, yeah, she gets touched by these things, but, uh, the monkey debate, the monkey debate
4141940	4143540	was, was pretty amazing.
4143540	4148660	She does not believe that dogs, just dogs, monkeys, whatever should only, they should
4148660	4151620	have some sort of autonomy over the roles that they are choosing.
4151620	4154820	That's why Blackfish is such a great movie because you're, it's, you're just rooting
4154820	4155620	for the killer whale.
4155620	4156820	You're like, oh, cool, man.
4161140	4165460	It's like, like, like these, like these, these, these what 17 year old interns that
4165460	4172260	are like, I love, I know you were doing a bit, but they're like, no, it's not, it's not that
4172260	4175860	trainer's fault, but I mean, you do feel for the killer whale.
4175860	4177940	Like, you know, they've been fucking prisoner.
4177940	4178100	Yeah.
4178100	4179300	But I think, yeah, but you could cut.
4179300	4180980	Well, why are we having this debate?
4181860	4186260	But you can, if you're young enough and you're that into animals, you could come out of high
4186260	4191460	school and be like, I want to work at SeaWorld because I love animals and you don't have to
4191460	4194660	have been on the boat where you're like pulling them out of the water and you're just like,
4194660	4196100	oh my God, I love this whale.
4196100	4197620	And you only know what you're told.
4197620	4202740	Like, I feel like these are not top scientists that are in the pool going, hey, here's some
4202740	4205300	fish wave to the crowd.
4205300	4209780	Like, I think the top researchers are probably doing some other high level shit.
4209780	4210420	You know, they're not.
4210500	4214020	Did you guys, the NPR, I've already talked about this, but the NPR thing about that,
4214020	4217300	it's all about monkey, it's monkey stories, chimp, chimp stories and all that stuff.
4217300	4223860	And one of them is the scientist who, like, there was a chimp that was in the lab at New
4223860	4227060	Fluent Sign Language, and it was like just allowed to wander around the lab.
4227060	4229940	And the, there was a male head of the department.
4229940	4234420	And then there was like a funding guy who came in and took him into his office and was yelling at him.
4235620	4237220	And, or no, no, no, I'm sorry.
4237220	4238100	It was the other way around.
4238900	4243540	Maybe the female was the, the female scientist was the head of the research department.
4243540	4247460	And she was being yelled at by a male who was like a, like a money guy.
4248340	4249460	I'm sure I got the story wrong.
4249460	4251140	I also got a million things about boat trip wrong.
4251140	4254740	So just, you always have to, you always have to just operate on my memory and just want to,
4254740	4259540	but the story I remember is that the monkey is, the chimp is sitting out there signing with the,
4259540	4263620	with a male who was like, I think a superior to the female.
4263620	4267860	I have no idea if monkey, if chimps are inherently sexist and he couldn't understand the hierarchy,
4267860	4272100	but he, he had a hierarchy in his head and was signing to the male scientist.
4272100	4277140	Like that, that guy's in there, like, like fucking up your shit.
4277140	4279060	Like, like he's like mistreating her.
4279060	4281140	Like you need to go in there and bite him.
4281140	4284580	And, and, and the guy's like, well, we don't, we don't, we don't bite each other.
4284580	4285540	That's not what we do.
4285540	4287860	And, and the chimps like, you gotta bite him.
4287860	4293620	He's, he's, look what he, he's in there dissing your, your woman.
4294740	4296660	He's in there like fucking with your whole thing.
4296660	4298900	And if you don't bite him, I'll bite you.
4300740	4301220	He signed this?
4301220	4306180	And the scientist was like, it was like, uh, we don't bite each other, Ralph.
4306180	4308420	So good day.
4308420	4310420	And then like, or, or it was, you know what?
4310420	4311460	It was the other way around.
4311460	4313460	It was like, that's the scariest thing about it.
4313460	4316340	I think it was the woman was signing with the chimp and the guy was,
4316340	4321620	the chip was saying to the woman, tell him to bite him or I'm going to bite him later.
4321620	4325300	In any case, there was like this elaborate conversation and it was like alarming.
4325300	4329780	And then they, and then like, uh, some time went by and the male scientist was
4329780	4331140	like sitting in his office.
4331140	4335940	Like it just picture, like he just laid down and the chimp was like allowed to just go
4335940	4336580	wherever I wanted.
4337140	4338980	And he just had some Xeroxes to do.
4338980	4342900	And they're like, uh, like, like the, the, the chimp, I mean, and he just came in the
4342900	4345860	guy's office, came across his desk and bit his hand.
4345860	4347860	It's so hard that he lost like three fingers.
4347860	4352660	Oh, and then he went, and then he, and the guy was like, Jesus fucking Christ, Herman.
4352660	4356100	I like, what the fuck are this blood everywhere?
4356100	4358100	He goes and gets his fingers reattached or whatever.
4358100	4362660	And then the, then the chimp, like after it just kept going, like, where's, where's Steve?
4362660	4366420	Like, like, like after he came back in there, it's like, uh, he's getting his fingers reattached.
4367300	4369860	And he's like, well, uh, well, where is he?
4369860	4370180	Where is he?
4370180	4372820	And he's like, he doesn't want to work with you anymore.
4372820	4375460	You bit his hand, you fucking cocksucker.
4378900	4382020	And he's like, uh, well, I mean, I had to like, like,
4382020	4383380	he's having a conversation.
4383380	4384500	He's like, that's what you do.
4384500	4390020	He was like, I had to bite his hand street law, you know, and they said, you need to apologize
4390020	4390580	to him.
4390580	4393300	And he was like, I don't know what that means or whatever.
4393300	4396500	Like the conversation was like, he either didn't know what apologizing was, or he was
4396500	4397780	like, I'm not sorry though.
4397780	4401940	You know, like in either case, it was like, but I had to, and then time went by and he
4401940	4403300	kept going like, where's Steve?
4403300	4405540	And they're like, dude, you, you're a fucking dick.
4405540	4406900	Like you, you did it.
4406900	4408500	You know that you remember Steve.
4408500	4410180	So you remember what you did.
4410180	4411540	And he's like, yeah, but whatever.
4411540	4413140	And then like, like all this time went by.
4413140	4416260	And then after a while, he apparently was like, okay, bring Steven here.
4416260	4417540	And he gave him a hug.
4417540	4420340	Like, like, like, he's like, all right, you fucking pussy.
4421940	4422980	Now let's get to work.
4423940	4424180	All right.
4424180	4425860	Bring me another, bring me another kitten.
4425860	4426180	All right.
4426180	4426900	Broke his neck.
4426900	4427380	All right.
4428260	4429620	I want my kid cat.
4431220	4433060	Fucking chimpanzees will rip your fuck.
4433060	4437860	They're, they're, they are humorless, like savage fucking monsters.
4437860	4438900	They have no compassion.
4439620	4441140	Uh, they're scary.
4441140	4442260	They look like us.
4442260	4444100	I get it, but they're monsters.
4444100	4445540	They stay terrified.
4445540	4446020	It's tricky.
4446020	4449620	When you put a cowboy hat on anybody, they seem more friendly, you know?
4449620	4449860	I know.
4449860	4452500	And then we want to do that, but it's like, we shouldn't be doing that.
4452500	4453220	What are you drinking?
4453220	4457540	We shouldn't be, we shouldn't be dressing chimps up because that's what they do to us.
4457540	4459620	That's chimp behavior to dress up a chimp.
4460260	4461300	Does that make sense?
4461300	4461940	Is that track?
4462660	4463780	We got to be more human.
4463780	4465460	That's why it's called the humane society.
4465460	4468100	Like, like being humane involves being nice to animals.
4468100	4469380	Unless you're eating them at every meal.
4470020	4472420	Well, do you, I guess the question then is,
4472420	4475540	does it make sense to even train these monkeys to talk because...
4475540	4476420	No, fuck no.
4476420	4477460	Well, no, no, no.
4477460	4477940	Well, you can't.
4477940	4479140	No, you should, I guess.
4479140	4479780	I feel like the plan is...
4479780	4481140	You should keep fucking with everything.
4481140	4481380	Yeah.
4481380	4482100	You want some too?
4482100	4482580	Okay.
4483300	4483780	Sorry, guys.
4485300	4485460	Yeah.
4485460	4488180	I feel like the plan is to make them soldiers, right?
4488180	4490580	Like, isn't that the idea?
4490580	4490980	Oh, man.
4490980	4495140	The cold open of lawnmower, man, shows you how dangerous that is.
4496260	4497460	There's a cold open of lawnmower, man.
4497460	4499380	It's like a chimp, like a Jim Henson chimp,
4499380	4501780	like going through a military base, killing people,
4501780	4504180	because it's been trained to do it in a video game.
4504180	4506180	Well, I mean, I mean, get home.
4507060	4507620	He's again.
4507620	4508980	Jim Henson chimp?
4508980	4510340	I talked into this.
4512660	4513700	I knew I had one thing in my head.
4513700	4514900	Talk about how monkeys are so dumb.
4516260	4518020	Monkeys don't even know how to use a microphone.
4520100	4523300	Yeah, I mean, well, I mean, monkeys probably have no remorse.
4523860	4524740	No, I bet they don't.
4525300	4528500	They like a terminator, like a five year old terminator with a rock hard dick.
4531060	4534580	Monkeys will eat baby monkeys just like for fun.
4534580	4535460	I mean, not for fun.
4535460	4538980	They do it for war, but they'll just like monkeys will get up at like three in the
4538980	4542340	morning and like high five each other and then go into the jungle and just
4542340	4545620	eat a bunch of baby monkeys from another monkey village.
4545620	4549380	By the way, Spencer, the way that you are positioned right now and what you just said,
4549380	4552820	I want to watch a just like an Andy Rooney segment of just you
4553380	4556180	me like just just melancholy about monkey.
4559220	4561060	Some cold hard facts about monkeys.
4561620	4564580	That's really just are you are you pro or con monkey?
4565140	4568500	I'm against like we should not we should not know.
4568500	4570500	I mean, we shouldn't know about monkeys.
4570500	4572500	We shouldn't seem like not know about them.
4572500	4578500	No, they should just be away from us because like, yeah, they do rip people's faces off.
4578500	4580100	Why are we all like that's pretty cool.
4580100	4581460	Let's figure out why that happens.
4581460	4583620	They're ripping people's fucking faces off.
4583620	4586340	Well, studying them has been pretty important to understanding ourselves.
4586340	4587140	Dumb.
4587140	4591940	But I mean, again, this show is this show is paying off huge dividends.
4591940	4597780	I just want that half an hour of just monkey monkey facts.
4597780	4598980	Monkey opinion.
4600500	4601140	I'm dead.
4601140	4602500	I wanted to be sent it out of monkeys.
4602500	4607300	I thought you were more taken, which is no, I just wanted to be a monkey or anything.
4607300	4608740	Yeah, no, it's just about the monkey.
4608980	4612020	You just resigned to this.
4613300	4614740	Yeah, they kill kids anyway.
4616420	4621540	But I think I feel like the bonobos have it going on because they they settle
4621540	4624580	other disputes through fucking and second, but they just jerk off.
4624580	4626100	They suck to the bonobos.
4626100	4629940	The one they suck and they masturbate and they're bisexual and they're they're
4629940	4630900	they're incestuous.
4630900	4633060	I don't know if they're the an advertiser and your podcast.
4633060	4635220	But why would you name your company Bonobos?
4635220	4637140	That's a big like podcast advertiser.
4637140	4639540	But nobody's one with the inflamed genitalia.
4639540	4642980	Like they like their like their assholes are like pink and rosy.
4642980	4643940	Like it's like a target.
4643940	4646260	They're the ones that are the most like us genetically.
4646260	4647220	Like they're the closest.
4647220	4648260	But what are their assholes?
4648260	4648900	Like that.
4648900	4649380	Why was it?
4652260	4654340	Rob wants to know the specifics of their assholes.
4654340	4656660	What do their assholes look like?
4657620	4659540	Rob equates everybody on asshole.
4659540	4660820	How their assholes look.
4661780	4663700	You guys have seen what they do with frogs, right?
4664260	4664420	No.
4664740	4669300	Google chimpanzee frog.
4669300	4670020	They fuck them.
4670020	4671060	And hit enter.
4671060	4671780	They fuck them.
4671780	4674180	And and and and be amazed.
4674180	4677460	Oh like that like almost like a pocket with these guys, right?
4677460	4678980	Like I said I wish I've heard.
4678980	4680020	There's a thousand videos.
4680020	4680500	No.
4680500	4681220	There's a thousand videos.
4681220	4682500	I don't think I can watch it.
4682500	4687220	Because any time a frog's ever come near a chimp they've gone they've gone like this
4687220	4690260	for a second and then they played with the mouth with their finger and then they just go.
4691140	4694500	I should probably a male chimp.
4694500	4699140	I mean I don't think yeah it's like like it's it's just they just do it.
4699140	4701620	And then like they throw the fucking frog away.
4701620	4704500	And then there's some videos where you watch the frog like limping away.
4706740	4708420	It's a comedy show.
4711460	4712500	They fuck the mouth.
4712500	4716020	They just they just use it as a yeah as a flashlight.
4716020	4717540	Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
4717540	4720180	This guy there research department that's what we're saying.
4721060	4722180	You guys can do it tonight.
4722180	4727300	You know and once we get to show you by once we get the show running to the peak you know like
4727300	4731380	that's my dream for the show is we need to we need to come up with a way that we can have a live
4731380	4737300	feed so that if they can see what the people at home are seeing then we can say Spencer bring up
4737300	4741220	Google chimp and frog and then and then they can be looking at it.
4741220	4743380	And then the people at home can be looking at it.
4744980	4745860	I don't want to watch that.
4745860	4750820	It kind of front row is so sick.
4750820	4751860	It's it's a bad pitch.
4751860	4752580	It's a bad pitch.
4754980	4755860	Speaking of bad pitches.
4755860	4757140	Why don't we start playing some shit.
4757140	4758420	It's as the mortgage here.
4758420	4759060	It's Mars Brown.
4759060	4759940	Are you are you in town.
4759940	4761940	I didn't see him in the green.
4761940	4762660	We have no tomorrow.
4762660	4763620	You got no tomorrow.
4763620	4764100	Oh shit.
4764100	4767060	So what we have Rob Schwab is here.
4767060	4767540	All right.
4767540	4769060	Oh right.

4801380	4802180	All the Rob's over here.
4803220	4804660	All the Rob's to the left.
4804660	4806100	Hello everybody.
4806100	4806600	Yay.
4809220	4810660	Glad I wore my jacket.
4811700	4813460	It's nice and chilly in here.
4814740	4815700	What's up Rob Schwab?
4816740	4817240	Eh.
4818740	4819700	I feel all right.
4819700	4822100	Rob if you could be a if you had to go toe to toe
4822100	4824660	at like the end like end of your life
4824660	4825700	like a battle royale.
4826420	4828500	You had to fight a nether animal.
4829540	4830660	Nether animal.
4830660	4831620	A nether animal.
4831620	4833380	If you could look into the netherverse.
4834260	4834900	If you could fight.
4834900	4836500	And fight a nether animal.
4837380	4839060	If you could fight a nether animal.
4839060	4840180	Another animal.
4840180	4841220	To the death.
4841220	4843540	Which animal do you think that you would be equally matched with?
4843540	4843940	And which one?
4843940	4844420	Gorilla.
4844980	4846100	You would fight a gorilla?
4846100	4846980	Fuck yeah.
4846980	4847700	For real?
4847700	4847940	No.
4849460	4850500	Okay how about this.
4850500	4851620	You get a weapon.
4851620	4852180	What do you mean?
4852180	4852980	You get to fight a-
4852980	4854420	I'm gonna choose a gorilla.
4854420	4856900	I'd use a gorilla as a weapon.
4856900	4857380	Yeah.
4857380	4858660	The fucker I'll kill anything.
4858660	4860180	Eh take that rhino.
4860180	4862580	Clint East could use the gorilla as a weapon in a bunch of movies.
4862900	4864180	I wasn't listening to this show.
4864180	4865060	What is going on?
4865060	4866660	You get to fight a gorilla.
4866660	4868820	It's you and a gorilla in a ring.
4868820	4870660	Like in a forest where-
4870660	4871540	We weren't talking about it.
4871540	4872340	There's no escape.
4872340	4873700	But you get one weapon.
4873700	4876980	But it's not a gun or like an arrow or a crossbow.
4876980	4878340	You get one melee weapon.
4878340	4880820	Like what do you fight a gorilla with?
4881620	4882180	A knife?
4882180	4882660	A hatchet?
4882660	4883300	Why?
4883300	4883780	Why are you-
4883780	4885380	I'm asking you a question, Shropp.
4886340	4886740	You and-
4886740	4887860	Did he do this to you guys?
4887860	4888820	No, no.
4888820	4889780	Kinda.
4889780	4892100	Well I mean he always asks different things all the time.
4892180	4895300	We've just been talking about happy little light subjects out here.
4895300	4895780	All right.
4896900	4898260	It's you versus a gorilla.
4898260	4898980	What weapon do you bring in?
4898980	4900340	Me versus Shropp versus gorilla.
4900340	4900500	Yeah.
4900500	4902020	What weapon do you bring in?
4902020	4903220	They can't be a gun or a-
4903220	4904420	A sharknado.
4904420	4905220	A sharknado.
4906260	4907220	Now I can't-
4907220	4907620	I don't know.
4909140	4910180	What's the point of this?
4910180	4911220	Let's say tomorrow you-
4912100	4912500	Let's say we-
4912500	4913140	I got one.
4913140	4914580	Let's say we all left the building tonight.
4914580	4915380	Voodoo doll.
4915380	4916340	Voodoo doll.
4916340	4916980	Voodoo doll.
4916980	4917540	Voodoo doll.
4917540	4918500	Gorilla voodoo doll.
4918500	4919380	Gorilla voodoo doll.
4919380	4919700	Okay.
4919700	4920500	I got it.
4920500	4921700	I like this.
4921780	4923460	What's up with this empty thing?
4923460	4924260	This is empty.
4924260	4924900	I put that there.
4924900	4925220	Sorry.
4925220	4926180	Oh, okay.
4926180	4926420	Why is-
4926420	4927140	She was in your chair.
4927140	4928260	Can we get Rob Shropp a beer?
4928260	4929780	Yeah, let's get Rob Shropp a beer.
4929780	4930100	All right.
4930100	4930580	Well let's-
4931140	4932180	You're drinking out of it.
4932180	4932500	Don't go.
4932500	4933380	He can have mine.
4933380	4933780	No.
4933780	4934580	I got Fernet Bronco.
4934580	4934740	All right.
4934740	4935460	Well Shropp is-
4935460	4937300	Who brought the Fernet Bronco, by the way?
4937300	4937860	What's your name?
4937860	4938580	Sam.
4938580	4939220	Hello, Sam.
4939220	4939860	Thank you so much.
4939860	4940580	Holy smokes.
4940580	4942660	Dan, what are you doing after the show tonight?
4942660	4943140	I-
4943140	4944180	Oh, I know Shropp.
4944180	4948580	You want to go watch Nightmare on Elm Street because we lost Wes Craven today, I guess.
4948580	4949700	Wes Craven is dead.
4949700	4950260	Yeah.
4950260	4950580	Yeah.
4950580	4951700	And the funny thing is I ran into Brian Collins-
4951700	4952660	It's not funny.
4952660	4953700	It's not funny that he died.
4953700	4954340	It's not.
4954340	4954980	It's kind of funny.
4954980	4955460	I said the funny thing.
4955460	4956020	Was it between-
4956900	4957460	What was-
4957460	4960420	Was there a choice between anything?
4960420	4961060	Like was it-
4961060	4963380	Between like John Carpenter or-
4963380	4963780	No, no, no.
4963780	4964980	I mean, as far as-
4964980	4967860	Were you saying like, was it always going to be Nightmare?
4967860	4968740	Or could it have been-
4968740	4969700	Oh, thank you so much.
4969700	4970900	Could it have been Scream 2?
4972020	4972420	What do you-
4972420	4972980	What do you-
4972980	4975780	I mean like, you're going to watch Nightmare on Elm Street tonight.
4975780	4976180	Oh, yeah.
4976820	4979780	Was that- Is there any other choice?
4979780	4980500	Deadly Friend.
4980500	4981780	Oh, interesting.
4981780	4983700	Deadly Friend is like one of my favorite Wes Craven movies.
4983700	4984660	Deadly Friend's great.
4984660	4985140	Shocker.
4985700	4986180	Shocker.
4986180	4986900	Shocker's great.
4986900	4989300	Or it's four in title, two in the pink.
4991460	4992660	Not two.
4992660	4994100	Shocker is-
4994100	4995220	What's his face in that?
4995220	4996740	That's Peter Berg, right?
4997540	4999700	Peter Berg acts in Shocker.
4999700	5001540	That was when he was like an 18-year-old actor.
5001540	5005220	There were two movies that came out when Shocker came out that were both very similar.
5005220	5006260	And it was very confusing.
5006260	5010180	There were two horror movies that were both about guys who died in electric chairs, I think.
5010180	5012740	Was Shocker the one that goes through the electric outlets?
5012740	5015460	Yeah, I think he becomes electricity, which also includes television.
5015460	5016180	But then there was another-
5016180	5017300	Terrifying.
5017300	5017860	There was a-
5017860	5018660	Yeah, it's all-
5018660	5021140	Special effects and horror always go great together.
5021140	5022500	So scary.
5022500	5025380	Long time man, perfect combination of both.
5025380	5026260	Horrifying.
5027700	5028900	So scary.
5028900	5032180	The one thing that's interesting about Wes Craven, though, I feel like,
5032260	5037140	is he really was able to keep a consistent reinvention of himself.
5037140	5037620	Yeah.
5037620	5038340	When he did-
5038340	5040660	I mean, Scream Queen is his, right?
5041460	5042900	I don't know if it is.
5042900	5043540	Scream Queen?
5043540	5045860	Is that the new show, that Scream Queen show?
5046900	5047300	Anyone?
5047300	5048100	Researchers?
5048100	5048500	Is it?
5050740	5051220	It's who?
5053460	5054900	No, that's Ryan Murphy.
5054900	5056500	That's American horror story.
5056500	5059300	We all have a tiny bit of information, all of this.
5059300	5062260	And we piece it all together.
5062260	5064420	Yeah, we're all just regurgitating like,
5064420	5065860	Hey, I thought I heard that.
5065860	5069140	I don't know, but yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5069140	5072660	But definitely a bunch of animals were killed on Nightmare on Elm Street.
5072660	5073620	I know, I know it.
5073620	5074100	I know it.
5076660	5080020	The best weapon, if you wanted to kill Wes Craven, would be a gorilla.
5080900	5082020	Yeah, yeah.
5082020	5083460	All right, Dan, he just died today.
5083460	5084340	Good joke.
5084340	5085140	Well, fuck you.
5086420	5088340	Wait, I queued you to do that?
5088420	5088900	What?
5091700	5092660	So what do you think?
5093540	5094820	I'm sad he's dead.
5094820	5096500	No, after the show.
5096500	5099460	This is the only reason that game is to guilt you into hanging out with me.
5099460	5100260	All right, I'll watch it.
5100900	5104340	Larry, do you think it's possible this might be a bad pitch?
5104340	5106180	Can we do it at my place because my dog's...
5106180	5108180	Yes, I would love to do it at your place because...
5108180	5109860	Guys, I live right in between both of you.
5109860	5111380	Do you guys know there's an audience here?
5113220	5114580	Wes Craven died!
5114580	5117300	He doesn't return my tax!
5118340	5119220	He doesn't!
5119220	5121780	You guys can call each other, you can email...
5121780	5122660	He doesn't pick up!
5122660	5123700	He doesn't pick up!
5123700	5127380	You don't have to invite all of these people and all of those people.
5128020	5130660	I was writing for the last like three weeks I've been...
5130660	5133140	You've been writing since 1993.
5135540	5136820	Let's be serious.
5136820	5138020	When is it gonna stop?
5138580	5141060	When are you gonna have time to hang out with me?
5141060	5148580	I gotta go up to a marathon of something I did.
5149620	5152100	Speaking of lines that would be great in a trailer for a concert movie,
5153060	5156180	that's part of the reason you guys came here because you're coming out with this
5156180	5157140	concert movie you did.
5157140	5161940	Oh yeah, we did a comedy special in one take on a moving bus.
5161940	5163300	Concert movies are misnomer though.
5163300	5163940	Yeah, yeah.
5163940	5166180	Because you're not gonna go out to theaters and watch out.
5166180	5168580	It does happen in one night on a glass bus.
5168580	5169460	Yeah, we just basically...
5171140	5176340	She and I made this show called Crash Test where we got this fucking insane glass tube
5176340	5177780	and we drove around all of Hollywood.
5177780	5181860	Most buses, you face the driver and this one you face the street
5181860	5185700	and it's like stadium seating and the street becomes the stage.
5185700	5188420	Yeah, so we just called all of our comedy friends and said...
5188420	5189460	Did you call me?
5190100	5190980	We did, as a matter of fact.
5190980	5191940	I think we did.
5191940	5194020	You gave us permission to hit the community stage.
5194020	5194980	Oh, that's right.
5195060	5197940	Yeah, you were calling Joel McHale through me.
5197940	5198580	That's what happened.
5199460	5203140	But so we just drove all around Hollywood and went to everybody's house and they just
5203140	5207220	came out in their front yard and did a bit with us and then the bus just keeps going.
5207940	5208820	It was so fun.
5208820	5209300	It was so fun.
5209300	5211940	So we made it into a special and it's on Vimeo.
5211940	5213140	Yeah, Vimeo on Demand.
5213140	5214100	What's it called?
5214100	5214900	Crash Test.
5214900	5215460	Vimeo.
5217780	5219300	No new taxes.
5220100	5228260	We have all of our comedy friends, Reno 911,
5228260	5232820	Reno 911 Reunion and Earl Sweatshirt, who we've been doing comedy with for,
5232820	5235460	God, like the last 10 years, you know, the odd future.
5235460	5236900	We grew up with them and...
5236900	5240580	It's literally like every funny comedy person you've ever seen and then Earl Sweatshirt.
5241460	5242740	He's awesome, but it's just like...
5242740	5246820	In your trailer, it does like a Tarantino kind of boom, boom, boom, boom,
5246820	5249780	of all the last names of like, look at all this fucking A-list people.
5249780	5250580	And then one of the...
5250580	5255860	It's all last names, Ansari, Cordri, Rudd, whatever.
5255860	5256740	Then it's like Sweatshirt.
5256740	5257380	Sweatshirt.
5257380	5258980	That makes me laugh too every day.
5258980	5262100	It operates on two levels because it's just the name of an object.
5263140	5265780	That's the only level, really, that it operates on.
5266740	5269140	But you were the only like...
5269140	5272420	Paramount let us shoot on their back lot and basically like,
5272420	5274180	yeah, you can shoot anywhere you want on their back lot.
5274980	5277380	Everything will be closed and we won't turn on any lights for you.
5278900	5282020	And then Dan was the one who let us at least open a stage door
5282020	5284100	so you get to see the set of community
5284100	5286820	and the amazing banner that you had out in front that says...
5286820	5287780	Sounds like a good friend.
5293140	5296500	I love Schwab's criticisms of you because they're all compliments.
5296500	5298660	Like you've been writing since 1993.
5298660	5299620	Yeah, I know.
5299620	5301780	Go to see a marathon or something that...
5301780	5302820	What a put down.
5304900	5305540	So great.
5307540	5310580	Anyways, Paul, you were gonna say a funny thing about my set.
5310580	5311540	Yeah, you have this...
5311540	5314420	Besides that you can go by the Greendell College,
5314420	5315540	you have this banner that says,
5315540	5317140	Nominated for Zero Emmys.
5318260	5318980	Hanging up.
5318980	5321060	You put that up for morale, you know.
5321060	5324180	It's one of the funniest things that's just subtly there,
5324180	5325620	right behind Jack McBrayer.
5325620	5326740	And you know what?
5326740	5329060	That was the smartest investment that show ever made
5329060	5331620	because I got to use that sign for three years in a row.
5334900	5336100	It paid for itself.
5336100	5337700	That's called amortization.
5337700	5339940	That's something Sony never appreciated.
5339940	5340980	I amortized.
5341940	5343540	Hey, Dan, do you think that we could all play
5343540	5345300	some Shadowrun together with this group?
5345300	5346500	I think so, yeah.
5346500	5350420	It's not our finest moment for feminism, but we'll...
5350420	5351940	You want me to do sound effects?
5352820	5353300	Yeah.
5353300	5355700	Okay, Rob will do sound effects.
5355700	5358420	No, you're probably gonna need to be a character
5358420	5359780	because we need everybody that we got up here.
5359780	5362340	So no sound effects.
5362500	5365060	You, Rob, follow your heart with sound effects.
5365060	5367540	If you feel like a sound needs to be affected...
5367540	5368180	How feel the room.
5368180	5369060	...I'll affect that sound.
5370340	5370980	I'll feel the room.
5370980	5371700	Well, if you want to...
5374660	5376580	Where did we land on you guys getting together
5376580	5377140	after the show?
5378580	5379700	If it's at my place.
5380660	5382340	Yes, yes, my...
5382900	5383460	Shrob.
5383460	5386820	I met my wife at Shrob's apartment.
5386820	5387380	That is true.
5388260	5390420	Shrob's apartment was my old apartment.
5390420	5391140	Is that true?
5391140	5391620	Yeah.
5391620	5393140	Shrob introduced me to my wife.
5393940	5394660	No reaction.
5394660	5395380	No reaction.
5395380	5395860	What?
5395860	5396820	Yeah.
5396820	5397380	Aw.
5399220	5399780	Shrob.
5399780	5401220	But my wife is half Japanese,
5401220	5403620	so she's half responsible for Milo and Otis.
5403620	5403940	Wow.
5405460	5408100	How many cats did your wife throw off a cliff?
5408100	5409940	Like, what's half of 36?
5411060	5411780	18.
5411780	5414500	Shrob, last great Wes Craven movie, Go.
5417300	5418420	Oh, shit.
5419220	5425540	Um, well, I mean, Scream is, like, it's game changing.
5425540	5427700	You know, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean...
5427700	5429140	Would you say it brought back horror?
5429140	5431220	I think it brought it to a new level.
5431220	5433460	I mean, it was, like, one of the first, like,
5433460	5437540	it brought meta to, like, contemporary, or to the people,
5437540	5441300	you know, like, I mean, it helped out this guy here
5441300	5444660	with his shit that he does on television.
5446020	5446660	Wow.
5447060	5448660	Now the insults are really flying.
5449380	5451060	Warmed up the room for him a little bit.
5454260	5455140	Should I talk?
5455140	5455940	Is it, it's not...
5455940	5457140	No, you should never talk.
5457140	5457380	Okay.
5458020	5458660	Sound effects.
5458660	5459220	Oh, no, no, no.
5459220	5461780	You're playing Aaron McGathey's character, uh...
5461780	5462820	Oh, my God, okay.
5465300	5465700	Oh, my God.
5468660	5469620	Oh, my God, okay.
5470180	5470820	Oh, my God.
5474180	5476260	Now, Paul and Rob, do you guys understand,
5476660	5478020	how Shadowrun works?
5478020	5478820	Absolutely.
5478820	5482740	No, I don't even know what I'm looking at right now.
5482740	5484900	If you see a Shadowrun, just fucking run, man.
5484900	5485540	Rob, I would run like shit.
5486740	5487620	That's that idea.
5488500	5490500	Rob, uh, what character, Rob Hubel.
5490500	5491300	Put your fuck in!
5491300	5492740	Hubel, what character do you have?
5495220	5495940	I lost it.
5496980	5498260	Are you Dr. Friend, by any chance?
5498260	5501060	Um, yeah, uh, uh, uh...
5501060	5503060	God damn it, this fucking stutter.
5503060	5503860	I did that fucking...
5503860	5504820	I'm Dr. Friend.
5505460	5506180	All right.
5506180	5507460	Paul, you're Dr. Friend.
5507460	5509540	I don't even pay attention to this shit.
5509540	5510660	Who are you, uh, Hubel?
5510660	5511140	Right there.
5511140	5512260	No, I'm just hanging out.
5512260	5513220	Fucking Hordegard.
5513220	5513940	Oh, you're Hordegard.
5513940	5515060	Okay, so you are...
5515060	5516340	Hordegard is kind of a what?
5516340	5518900	Like, he's a dwarf, cool dude.
5518900	5520660	He's like a German doctor.
5520660	5521060	No, no.
5521060	5522020	Or, no, a German psychic.
5522020	5523460	Hordegard's a dwarf.
5523460	5526020	A dwarf German, but clearly German.
5527460	5528260	He's Dutch, I think.
5528260	5529780	DuMourge does them with some kind of...
5529780	5531140	He's from Oslo.
5531140	5532260	Oh, it's Norwegian, either.
5532980	5534900	Okay, so you're best Norwegian.
5535380	5537140	And Paul, you are...
5537140	5537780	Dr. Friend.
5537780	5539220	Dr. Friend, who's a, uh...
5540340	5540900	What's he, a...
5540900	5542100	He's a troll.
5542100	5543700	A troll doctor.
5543700	5547780	A male troll doctor who has an armor jacket.
5547780	5548500	Yes.
5548500	5550420	He's kind of a mob doctor archetype, you know?
5550420	5553940	He's like a black market doctor who travels with us.
5553940	5555220	And Hordegard is sort of...
5555220	5556900	Hordegard's kind of our eye in the sky.
5556900	5560420	He's kind of see, like, he's our map, like, when we need...
5560420	5564180	I feel like we shouldn't waste time of your listeners and your audience,
5564340	5564740	but explain.
5564740	5565620	Let's just fucking do it.
5565620	5566180	I'm gonna...
5566180	5566740	I mean...
5566740	5567780	Agreed.
5567780	5568900	What's the worst that could happen?
5568900	5571700	Like, I'm gonna fucking swallow a snail.
5575300	5576020	Oh, yeah.
5576660	5579380	Previously on Harm and Run Shadow Time.
5579380	5584260	In rage that their Johnson had double-crossed them with a ghoul magnet-trapped briefcase,
5584260	5589700	Dr. Friend and Eve Libertine decided to combine forces in seeking righteous retribution.
5589700	5594980	Eve summoned a Spirit Eagle for a delivery system for a rage-empowered agony spell.
5594980	5600180	Hordegard contributed to the revenge cocktail with general psychic fusion.
5600180	5605220	And Jim Nightblade, not wanting to dampen the synergy, openly declared his sexuality
5605220	5610580	because the only thing that is more powerful than a secret is the secret's exposure.
5610580	5616260	The doctor quickly restored the drained Eve, allowing her to summon an additional spirit
5616260	5618660	sparrow to search after the Johnson.
5618660	5623460	And the gang searched their souls and evaluated their recent exploits and setbacks.
5623460	5629380	Time to get paid, or time to get some paid back, or time to pay Shadowrun style.
5631460	5632420	All right.
5632420	5633620	Can you say that, Oleg?
5637620	5639460	It's Patrick who wrote that for us.
5639460	5642100	That was by Pat Spanagel.
5643060	5643540	What?
5643540	5644420	Pat Spanagel?
5645140	5647460	Patrick Spanagel.
5647460	5649380	You're not even writing the stuff anymore?
5649380	5649860	Nah, man.
5649860	5651300	I have sources.
5651300	5654020	He's like Jim Davis, like Year 9 of Garfield.
5654020	5654980	Oh, man.
5654980	5655860	It's just like, I don't know.
5655860	5656980	Put him on a roller coaster.
5656980	5657380	Is that true?
5657380	5658420	Is it Jim Davis?
5658420	5659140	Boo.
5659140	5660980	Spencer, did my sparrow-
5660980	5663700	What has happened just the last time I've been here?
5663700	5667460	Spencer, did my mystic sparrow find anything?
5667460	5669220	He's reading off his phone?
5669220	5669780	Yeah.
5669780	5672340	We have guest writers for it.
5673300	5674500	Let's see what we got.
5677780	5684020	Spencer, did my sparrow find the driver of the car that left us holding the bag?
5684020	5686100	You just sent it out, but not yet.
5686100	5686580	Okay.
5686580	5687940	It might take some time.
5687940	5689940	Okay, I'll hold tight on that one.
5689940	5690580	Shit.
5690580	5691700	I mean, all right.
5691700	5692900	So we are-
5692900	5693700	God damn it.
5693700	5695140	You're in a parking lot.
5695140	5695860	All right.
5695860	5698180	There's zombies, ghouls.
5698180	5700260	They're kind of just cruising around though.
5700260	5701620	They're not meaning you any harm.
5701700	5702900	How many shadows?
5702900	5704500	There's like seven shadows.
5705380	5707060	Get the fuck out, man.
5707060	5708660	You got to get the fuck out.
5708660	5709940	You got to run, man.
5710580	5718260	Well, guys, I say we go our separate ways to wait for another shadow run to call us.
5718260	5719220	Why don't we go back to that bar?
5719220	5720980	What's the bar called that we all hang out at?
5720980	5722660	Where the Johnsons hang out?
5722660	5723780	Hank's Last Stand.
5723780	5724660	Hank's Last Stand.
5724660	5726260	You guys want drinks around me?
5727700	5728420	Let's go to Hank's.
5728420	5729220	I'll have a drink.
5729220	5730500	I'll have a drink.
5730580	5735220	All right, well, I call an Uber and we go to Hank's Last Stand.
5735220	5736580	What time are we in?
5736580	5737060	I thought we were in-
5737060	5738820	2050 what?
5738820	5741060	2070 something.
5741060	5743300	So this is when monkeys are all gone, right?
5743300	5745060	There's no such thing as monkeys.
5745060	5747220	So there's no beholders or dragons or anything?
5747220	5747620	Yeah.
5747620	5748340	Oh, there's dragons.
5748340	5749060	Well, there's dragons.
5749060	5749860	There's no beholders.
5749860	5750660	There's no monkeys.
5751780	5752180	Thank God.
5752180	5752420	There's-
5753940	5754980	It's magical, right?
5754980	5755780	There's no-
5755780	5756740	Yeah, there's magic.
5756740	5758180	I'm already disappointed.
5758180	5759380	We don't lose.
5759380	5763060	We don't lose any points for the data mining that Uber will take from us, right?
5763940	5764900	Not these days.
5764900	5768340	You don't even have any data that's safe at all.
5768340	5769060	Okay.
5769060	5772180	I had 11 Uber drivers reject me before getting-
5772180	5773780	I had to drive myself here.
5775540	5778420	Wait, is this Rob Shrobb or is this a character?
5778420	5779380	No, this is me.
5779380	5780740	I thought it was your character.
5780740	5782100	No, it's not a character.
5782100	5783620	Is this Aaron McGathey's character talking?
5783620	5784340	No, I-
5784340	5785060	Mercy.
5785060	5785940	I had to drive myself.
5785940	5787860	Mercy, you're our face man.
5787860	5791300	Why did so many drivers reject you?
5792580	5793460	Rob Shrobb.
5793460	5795700	No, you're Mercy O'Donnell.
5795700	5800500	Okay, well, I'll tell you later as myself.
5803220	5804580	11, 11.
5806420	5809300	Mercy, you're so charming.
5809300	5812820	You have the prettiest face in town and you're so charming.
5812820	5814020	That is true, yeah.
5814020	5816500	Why would so many drivers reject you, do you think?
5816500	5817540	Well, it didn't happen to me.
5817620	5818820	It happened to Rob Shrobb.
5822580	5824500	But that was like 65 years ago.
5825860	5826660	60 years ago.
5828020	5829460	It was longer than that.
5831300	5831780	Oh, okay.
5831780	5832260	All right.
5832260	5834020	Let's go to the-
5834020	5835220	Let's go to the bar, right?
5835220	5836740	Let, let, let, let, let, let it out.
5836740	5837540	Okay, we're at the bar.
5837540	5839220	Yep, that happens.
5839220	5843940	You roll into Hank's last stand as the Uber drone drives off.
5843940	5846660	You recognize some familiar faces.
5846740	5850660	You see Hank and Teddy and also Hack Eye.
5850660	5851860	They're all just chilling.
5853300	5855700	Hank, Teddy, Hack Eye?
5856260	5859460	Hey, what, how'd it go?
5860900	5863620	Waiting for the third one to answer.
5865860	5866660	What?
5866660	5867140	Oh, okay.
5871780	5873620	Only one person has been talking.
5874420	5876420	Oh, where's Hank and Teddy?
5877380	5877860	Hey, guys.
5877860	5878900	Hey, what's up, Teddy?
5881300	5883140	Sorry, I was in the, I was in the bathroom.
5885780	5887620	Teddy, Hack Eye?
5888980	5890260	Where's, where's Hank?
5890260	5891620	He's, he's right there.
5892260	5892900	I'm right here.
5894020	5894980	Oh, hey, what's up, Hank?
5894980	5895540	How you doing, man?
5898420	5900820	How come you guys took so long to sit down?
5902100	5906180	I was over there with that Jeep bucks, trying to pick a song.
5907220	5909540	That applied to my life, but I couldn't find one.
5910580	5912980	Nightblade, tell them, tell them what happened.
5914100	5915940	Well, the music industry's taking a hit.
5920420	5923700	Because of all the increased technology, it's, anybody who plays a power chord
5923700	5925380	can get a record deal now, so.
5925380	5926100	Amen.
5926100	5931460	There's a lot of more popular songs, tickle that toe-tapping bone at a wedding or funeral, but
5932180	5936660	by and large, no one, no one makes the connection that the Beatles used to.
5938180	5939700	Amen, amen to that.
5939700	5941700	My, my grandparents listened to the Beatles.
5941700	5942820	Oh, shit, yeah, the Beatles.
5946820	5950420	I grew, my grandparents' parents listened to the Beatles and they told me all about it.
5950420	5952580	Anyway, well, well, well.
5952580	5956900	Well, anyways, yeah, we went to drop off the, the, the job and we got
5956900	5960020	a ghoul magneted by the Johnson.
5960660	5962340	It's not worth going into detail.
5962980	5964580	We got fucked over on the job.
5964580	5966580	We're starting to think where I am rather.
5966580	5968660	I won't pretend that my, I'm going to take a shit.
5973780	5974420	Hey, let's go.
5975460	5978420	Well, we'll pretend that my, my viewpoint.
5978420	5980260	Is it cool if I go watch her take a shit?
5981220	5981940	Go for it.
5981940	5983140	Come on in.
5983140	5983780	Free country.
5984820	5985620	We got to keep her.
5985620	5986740	I'll keep the door open.
5987060	5987940	There's no music.
5987940	5988740	There's no music.
5988740	5990740	So we got to keep ourselves entertained by something.
5992500	5993220	We just watch each other.
5993220	5998980	Can we change the station on the TV for, while I, it'll help this go faster.
6003060	6005140	The job, the job went, went poorly.
6006660	6010500	So no with the changing of the, no, I'm not, I'm not in the bathroom.
6010500	6012180	We don't, we don't want, I'm yelling.
6012180	6013700	What would you say if I had a job?
6013700	6015140	You don't have to shit so fast.
6015860	6016180	Okay.
6020980	6023860	Why is this girl shooting with her legs crossed?
6024980	6025620	I've seen it.
6025620	6026500	I've seen it all before.
6026500	6027060	What would you say?
6027860	6029460	What would you say if I had a job for you?
6030020	6030740	A job?
6030740	6031220	What?
6031220	6031780	A job.
6031780	6032660	You had a job?
6032660	6032900	Yeah, I want a job.
6032900	6033780	It's a dangerous job.
6033780	6034420	I want a job.
6036420	6037060	Nicely.
6037060	6037940	What job?
6039620	6041300	Close the door while you're shitting.
6041300	6041940	All right.
6041940	6042820	Jesus Christ.
6042820	6044340	Get in, get in here.
6044340	6044980	Cool, cool.
6044980	6045620	Yeah, I'm down.
6046740	6051140	We, we, we all go into the, we all go into the bathroom with mercy while she's taking a shit.
6051140	6051940	Jesus Christ.
6051940	6053300	I can't believe, all right, fine.
6053300	6054100	Go watch her.
6054100	6055700	I mean, she crosses her legs with a shit.
6055700	6057780	She's like a real live girl taking a shit.
6057780	6058740	Let's talk in private.
6058740	6061060	She crosses her legs so you can look in.
6061060	6062340	It's, it's gross.
6062340	6063940	I didn't even know girls took shits.
6063940	6064420	They do.
6065300	6066020	They do.
6066020	6067540	I have a job.
6068900	6070260	We should go out of the bathroom.
6072020	6073060	Oh, God damn it.
6074820	6075620	I'm done.
6075620	6075860	Okay.
6076660	6077540	All right.
6077540	6077860	Okay.
6077860	6079540	It wasn't even a fulfilling shit.
6079540	6082180	It was like almost like two little things.
6082180	6083140	What's the job?
6083140	6083940	What do you have for us?
6083940	6084420	Yeah, what's the job?
6084420	6086980	I need you guys to break into a storage facility.
6086980	6087540	Is that true?
6089620	6092340	Well, we're, we have a bunch of mp3s in there.
6092340	6092580	What?
6092580	6093620	Oh no, wait, I can.
6094580	6095300	No, go for it.
6095300	6096260	What are, what's the thing?
6096260	6098980	I kind of want to go, wait, what's, where's this going?
6098980	6100500	It's getting good.
6100500	6101700	Is Paul Riffig or is this?
6101700	6102820	Yeah, let's do it.
6102820	6103620	Let's do it.
6104260	6109060	I have a storage facility full of mp3s with the good stuff.
6109060	6110340	Full of mp3s?
6110340	6115460	mp3s, beetles, stones, Cyrus.
6115460	6120100	I got them all, Wiz Khalifa, all of it in there.
6120900	6122980	But no, nobody's my favorite.
6122980	6125060	You didn't need to rent a storage facility for that.
6125060	6126100	I didn't rent it.
6126100	6128820	I just know there's a place where all the mp3s are held.
6129460	6130820	Old music, good music.
6130820	6132340	He's Dr. Friend, right?
6132340	6134100	No, no, I'm Henry now.
6134100	6138180	Is it true what they say that all the pops and whistles on those old mp3s are,
6138180	6140260	make the sound somehow better than.
6140260	6142180	Oh, those ones and zeros.
6143620	6144900	It's so smooth.
6144900	6147140	He wouldn't even think they played instruments.
6148500	6149220	Oh my God.
6149780	6151700	I mean, I grew up on that.
6151700	6156020	When I was fleeing the government and I was living in the hills with the Native Americans,
6156020	6158340	we used to play mp3s and that was a shit.
6158340	6159860	That's the stuff I grew up on.
6159860	6162340	People used to have players in the size of their hands.
6162340	6162820	I know.
6163460	6166820	I know, but that's almost 80 years ago.
6166820	6169860	I would do anything to get my hands on those.
6169860	6170180	Look, if you guys can-
6170180	6170980	More importantly-
6170980	6171860	Oh, sorry.
6171860	6172580	You need to go ahead, no.
6172580	6175460	Well, I'll just say, if you guys got them for me, I'd be very excited about it.
6175460	6175860	Go ahead.
6175860	6177140	No, no, go ahead.
6177140	6178420	I just want to listen to them.
6178420	6178900	No, no, no.
6178900	6179940	Okay, go ahead.
6179940	6180980	No, you get the job.
6181460	6182420	Well, no, I'm just saying that.
6182420	6184020	I agree, I agree.
6184020	6186500	Back then, when those players were so big, you could put one in a paper cup.
6187300	6187860	Well, yeah, I know.
6187860	6189460	Just amplify the sound like a little portable.
6189460	6190100	Go ahead.
6190100	6190500	Sorry.
6190500	6192580	No, there's nothing more to say than just saying like,
6192580	6196900	yeah, I'd love to listen to some good old classic music and see this pop culture junk in here.
6196900	6199620	But more importantly, so is the customer.
6200340	6201220	Talking big money.
6202260	6204180	We'll bring people back to Hank's bar.
6204900	6205380	Finally.
6208100	6208580	Hey.
6208580	6210260	Wait, he's Hank, right?
6210260	6210740	Hey.
6210740	6211540	Yeah, he's Hank.
6211540	6213140	I talk about him in the third person.
6213140	6213940	Hey.
6213940	6214420	Hey.
6214420	6214820	What?
6214820	6215220	Hey.
6215220	6215700	Yeah.
6215700	6216020	Yeah.
6216020	6216580	What's up?
6216580	6220340	Each one of those MP3s is like 99 cents, man.
6222100	6223300	That's a lot of money.
6225380	6227220	There's more than like three of them.
6227220	6229300	More like $1.29 in the later days.
6229300	6230740	Oh, shit.
6230740	6231940	Hey, Hank.
6231940	6238980	Hank, why has it been so long since we've seen MP3s of all this great old music for so long
6238980	6241220	and nobody's had access to all this great stuff?
6241220	6242580	Music causes revolution.
6243540	6245860	Good music will make everybody revolt.
6245940	6247540	They have to take away our music.
6247540	6249540	Leave us with this candy-coated bullshit.
6249540	6250100	Oh, my God.
6250100	6250820	You're right.
6250820	6254100	Guys, Shadowrunners, if we get our hands...
6254100	6255060	Do we have a nickname?
6255060	6255860	Do we have a team name?
6255860	6256980	I like Shadowrunners.
6256980	6257220	Okay.
6259940	6262980	I mean, we can vote, but it'll take a while.
6262980	6268820	Look, I'm Eve Liberty, because I named myself after a punk band from the 70s from Crass.
6269700	6270580	I feel like he's right.
6270580	6271140	Hank is right.
6271140	6274420	If we get our hands on this music, there's a chance that we can take this old music
6275060	6276260	and bring humanity back to where it used to be.
6276260	6277220	What was the band?
6277220	6278100	It was called Crass.
6279220	6279700	Cool.
6281380	6282100	You never heard of it?
6282900	6283540	I did now.
6284340	6284660	Okay.
6284660	6285140	Keep going.
6285140	6285460	Keep going.
6285460	6285620	Okay.
6287220	6288260	I don't care what it takes.
6288260	6292740	At all costs, I want to get my hands on this music, and I want to make sure that everybody gets
6292740	6296580	to hear this, because that's the stuff that might change people's minds and bring us back
6296580	6298100	to the humans that we used to be.
6298100	6299060	Amen.
6299060	6299700	Thank you, Hank.
6301060	6303060	Well, did you flush that shit that you took?
6303060	6304180	No, I better go back.
6304420	6305220	You want to come with?
6305220	6305860	Yeah, come with me.
6305860	6306100	Okay.
6307940	6308820	We go back.
6308820	6309460	Okay.
6309460	6310580	Both of us go back.
6310580	6311700	Sound effects, sound effects.
6311700	6314020	Both of us go back to the bathroom.
6314020	6319780	And then Dr. Friend uses his detox on you, which allows you to eliminate all the side effects of
6319780	6321540	that terrible meat poison.
6321540	6322180	Oh, boy.
6324180	6325300	Look at that massive shit.
6325300	6326420	It's like using a squatty button.
6326420	6326660	Yes.
6327620	6334020	You could kind of like see what my day was, like just in the relief of...
6337700	6339060	Everybody checking this out?
6339060	6339380	Okay.
6339380	6340660	I'm going to flush it.
6340660	6341220	Flush it.
6341220	6344260	Hey, so Hank, goodbye.
6345700	6346180	Goodbye.
6347940	6349060	Goodbye, lady shit.
6349860	6351860	Hank, where are these MP3s?
6352900	6354340	All I got is this data map.
6357060	6360340	Portagard, give Portagard the data map.
6360340	6361060	Here's their map.
6362580	6363460	The other guy.
6363460	6365620	Thank you very much for giving it to me.
6368020	6368900	Yes, thank you.
6370580	6378340	I would also like to say that Shadowrunners sounds to me more like a racist Disney movie.
6381220	6386100	I am not so sure about the name Shadowrunners as a nickname for the group.
6386980	6388420	It's not Shat, it's Shadow.
6389700	6391220	I understood what you said.
6392260	6392820	I still...
6393460	6394420	Wait a second.
6394420	6395620	There's one thing I got to tell you.
6395620	6396100	Oh, shit.
6396100	6396660	Hank, what is it?
6396660	6396900	Shit.
6397780	6401620	I hope one of you has musical ability because to break into this facility,
6402420	6403780	they don't have key codes.
6404660	6405140	Mercy.
6405140	6406900	Mercy has musical ability, I think, right?
6409460	6410180	Spencer, am I right?
6411860	6412900	They don't have key codes.
6413460	6415620	They have music codes.
6417220	6417940	You have to play music codes.
6417940	6421460	If it's not one thing, it's another with these codes, man.
6421460	6425860	They couldn't come up with a better name for it than music codes.
6425860	6427140	I mean, I just heard about it.
6427940	6429460	I heard about it as music codes.
6430420	6431460	Music codes.
6431460	6435460	Yeah, so give us a location and we'll take care of the rest.
6435460	6437940	Well, I gave you the data map, but now I told you a little secret.
6437940	6439140	I have the data map.
6440500	6441380	All right, can you hear that?
6441380	6442260	Well, let's get going.
6442260	6443460	Come on, huh?
6443460	6444500	Let's get on my...
6444500	6445300	Somebody Uber...
6445940	6447140	I call an Uber.
6447140	6448660	Buh-la-buh-la-buh-la-buh-la-buh.
6449460	6449940	What?
6449940	6450580	That's all right.
6450580	6451380	Well, all right.
6451380	6453140	Look at the size of that building.
6458660	6463380	You find yourself outside of a large building.
6463380	6463780	Yeah.
6466340	6469780	It's not related to the storage facility.
6471460	6472660	Oh, did I punch...
6472660	6474180	Did you punch in the wrong address?
6474180	6475460	I thought you had the address.
6475460	6476020	Shit.
6477060	6478180	Let's look at the data map.
6478180	6479220	Wait a second, guys.
6479220	6480340	This is me, Dr. Friend.
6481540	6482180	Where were you?
6483140	6485380	I was just watching that whole scene at Hank's bar.
6485380	6487940	I thought this was a cool mission and I just kind of sit back
6487940	6489860	and just let you guys handle it.
6489860	6492340	It didn't feel like there was any reason for me to interject.
6492340	6495700	This pervert's name, Hank, gave us a date.
6495700	6496420	I saw the whole thing.
6496420	6498660	I was right there watching shit.
6498660	6500100	I watched some more massive shit.
6500100	6501140	I heard about the thing.
6501140	6503780	You never said anything when merciless shit.
6503780	6507300	I mean, you know my part of my character is just keeping it cool.
6509460	6510820	Pitching in when I got something.
6510820	6512340	I don't speak to speak.
6512340	6513620	Spencer, we got the right address, right?
6514740	6515220	Well, no.
6516020	6517460	I actually plugged it in.
6517460	6520420	This is a musical academy, kind of like a school of rock.
6522020	6523460	I think we need to practice.
6523460	6527380	So we're going to learn music first to learn the musical colors?
6528660	6531300	I told you I didn't speak up there because I figured
6531300	6533060	you guys would all be on board with this.
6533060	6536660	Dr. Friend, that's a good idea because we can't go into that building
6536660	6537860	without knowing the music.
6538420	6539940	We're going to learn how to do music together.
6539940	6540420	We could try.
6542420	6543140	We could try.
6544420	6552660	Well, I walk manfully, womanfully through the front doors of the musical academy building.
6552660	6553460	You do that.
6554020	6558020	You find several small children staring at you creepily.
6559460	6560980	Throw mashed potatoes at them.
6563060	6565700	Don't worry, kids.
6565700	6566420	That's a callback.
6566420	6567460	That's what they call a callback.
6568980	6571220	Hey, kids, I'm entering too.
6571220	6572980	Hey, kids, I heard you could teach us how to sing.
6574020	6575140	That might be true.
6575860	6578260	We need to learn how to perform.
6578260	6579700	Look, kids, how old are you all?
6581300	6581940	Seven.
6581940	6583220	Seven averages.
6583220	6585620	Look, we're bad Shatterrunners.
6585620	6588100	We mostly just speak for yourself.
6589860	6591380	We've done nothing but make mistakes.
6591380	6592180	That's true.
6592180	6598340	I think it's time for us to admit that maybe kids could teach us how to work in harmony together.
6599540	6603860	So, kids, maybe your groans are misplaced.
6605940	6607140	I'm on their side.
6607140	6610500	I feel like we need these children to teach us.
6610500	6618260	So, I for one, if we want these MP3s to reunite humanity through music, through the good old days.
6618260	6619700	Thank you for recapping.
6619700	6620100	Thank you.
6620260	6624340	Um, kids, where do we start our education?
6624900	6626340	We should probably show them what we got.
6626980	6627460	Yeah.
6627460	6628820	Oh, so we should.
6631700	6632980	And then let them adjust us.
6633620	6634340	Yeah.
6634340	6635700	Because you never know.
6635700	6638020	Maybe, maybe we could get it right the first time.
6680100	6681860	You gotta run, run, run.
6681860	6684820	You gotta run, run, run.
6684820	6689220	You gotta run, run, run.
6689220	6690260	And that's what we got.
6690260	6691140	That's basically what we got.
6691140	6692260	Holy shit, that was great.
6697140	6699140	What did the, what did the kids think?
6699140	6701140	Is that good, is that good, kids?
6701140	6702820	We'll find out next time.
6702820	6703460	Oh, all right.
6703460	6705620	Well, we'll hear the kids' reaction when we do.
