0	29880	It's 8 o'clock Pacific Standard Time and you know what time that is.
29880	31880	It's Harman Time.
31880	39520	Ladies and gentlemen from beautiful uptown Burbank, Harman Town is now in session.
39520	46320	Please welcome to the stage, your Game Master, Extra Daenerys, Spencer Cranden.
46320	56200	He's got a bag full of fun, a fun full of bag and his beard.
56200	58200	You beard getting sexier?
58200	60200	No.
60200	74200	Let's hear it for your Mayor of Harman, Mr. Dan Harman.
74200	83200	Pooping your shoe, pooping your hat, poop on a ball, poop on a bat, poop on your head, poop on some bread, poop on your mama, now she's dead a bit.
83200	86200	Went to the La Brea guitar pits and took a poof.
86200	90200	Invited papers to get the scoop but papers are dead and journalism is long gone.
90200	93200	I fucked your mama so hard your pussy's a front lawn.
93200	95200	Then I mowed it, I made it clean.
95200	97200	It's not about shaving, it's not what I mean.
97200	99200	It's not about objectifying the vagina.
99200	104200	I'm going to North Carolina with my beef dick and I'm making a canyon.
104200	109200	I fucked your mama and she said damn son, fuck me more.
109200	110200	So I did it.
110200	111200	Let's have some s'mores.
111200	113200	Let's do it, graham crackers, little mellow.
113200	117200	Fuck your mama, she's yellow.
117200	119200	I mean cowardly.
119200	121200	I mean cowardly.
121200	122200	All right.
122200	126200	Thank you.
126200	128200	It's a whole avenue of trouble I haven't gotten into yet.
128200	130200	You're going to have to apologize for that rap.
130200	132200	Yeah.
132200	138200	Well, thank you for joining us again in our No Audience podcast.
138200	142200	There's some good signs on that front.
142200	151200	I think Nolan's been making some progress and there's some shifting in the power halls
151200	153200	in the city of Burbank.
153200	158200	I think there's a new guy who came, who's like in charge of Burbank now and he came
158200	164200	through and he was like pretty friendly and into the venue and he suggested, you know,
164200	168200	you guys separate these desires of serving liquor here and doing a show here.
168200	172200	You know, you could probably get an audience back in here a lot faster and you can still
172200	176200	work on the license for the serving.
176200	181200	So I think if we do that, we could be looking at an audience version of the podcast again
181200	182200	soon.
182200	184200	How soon?
184200	185200	Not soon.
185200	186200	What a popular thing.
186200	188200	Probably not soon.
188200	189200	Not very soon.
189200	190200	I mean sooner, certainly.
191200	199200	Not so soon that if that's what you're waiting for, you should prepare or hang your hopes
199200	200200	on it at all.
200200	205200	How do you feel about doing it with or without the audience?
205200	207200	What's the difference for you?
207200	210200	I think we all prefer it without an audience, right?
210200	213200	It's been so much easier and better.
213200	217200	I think we've eaten our share of the lonely sandwich.
217200	221200	It's six at one, whatever.
221200	224200	We haven't done it with an audience in a million years, so I'm looking forward to it.
224200	229200	Speaking of which, we're going to be at Sketchfest in San Francisco in front of an audience.
229200	231200	We're not going to bring our lack of audience with us.
231200	235200	That's too expensive to fly that much lack of audience.
235200	237200	We can't fly a lack of audience?
237200	238200	No.
238200	242200	So we're going to go to an audience in San Francisco and do a little show there.
242200	244200	I guess Google it.
244200	245200	I don't know.
245200	250200	Yeah, Google, SF, Sketchfest, Harmon Town 2018 or something along those lines.
250200	251200	Yeah.
251200	252200	Yeah.
252200	257200	I wanted to do our Belmont joke, but you don't even remember writing it.
257200	258200	Oh, it was a Belmont joke?
258200	259200	Yeah, yeah.
259200	260200	You said camera.
260200	261200	I didn't understand what you're talking about.
261200	262200	It's all right.
262200	263200	That was part of the joke.
263200	264200	Yeah.
264200	265200	You have it written down, right?
265200	267200	I have the bullet points.
267200	271200	Okay, so why don't you set this up or should I set it up?
271200	273200	Okay, so we have this friend.
273200	278200	She's a director, Sofia, it's a Swedish name.
278200	281200	It's not Shmukamukamuka, but yeah.
281200	286200	You should have her last name because a long time ago, I tweeted a music video that she
286200	288200	did right over here in this space.
288200	290200	She does stop motion stuff.
290200	294200	She's done a couple of music videos at Starburns now.
294200	296200	Very, very talented director.
296200	297200	She's from Sweden.
297200	299200	She's here on some kind of visa or whatever.
300200	304200	Maybe if you're a fan of Cody's Instagram, you've seen her teaching Cody how to say
304200	307200	various filthy things in Swedish.
307200	313200	What I do have, Dan, is the Wikipedia Belmont joke.
313200	315200	Right, so we were talking about jokes.
315200	317200	Somehow it came up.
317200	320200	She said there's this tradition in Sweden that's called the Belmont joke.
320200	327200	Belmont is like kind of the all-purpose character in a...
327200	333200	He's the butt of the joke, but he's also kind of the hero of the joke in his own naivete
333200	334200	stupidity.
334200	338200	We found ourselves culturally fascinated with it because we're Americans, so we have
338200	341200	Pollock jokes, we have blonde jokes, we have all kinds of horrible jokes.
341200	347200	I can't even mention by category, but we don't have American jokes where we're
347200	352200	cast as either the wise guy in a ship of fools or the...
352200	356200	There's some jokes where it's like you're trying to pump yourself up like a redneck
356200	361200	and a Yankee go into a place and the redneck just does this and he's a simple
361200	363200	working man and you're like, yay.
363200	368200	The first paragraph in the Wikipedia for Belmont joke is, the Belmont joke is a type
368200	374200	of simple joke popular among Swedish school children, always including a person named
374200	377200	Belmont as the main character.
377200	378200	And very often...
378200	380200	Do they have an example in there?
380200	381200	Yeah.
381200	384200	Very often it's like, you know how in America when you're a kid you learn these
384200	390200	jokes are like a black guy, a Chinese guy and a Polish guy go into a popcorn store
390200	395200	or whatever and the Polish guy ends up doing something stupid or maybe it's the black
395200	398200	guy that does something that's more pragmatic or...
398200	406200	But in this case, there's two cultures and Belmont who is a person and he stands apart.
406200	411200	He's either the villain or the hero, depending on your point of view.
411200	417200	I think it's like a manifestation of Sweden as they're like, well, what are we going to
417200	418200	do?
418200	420200	We probably don't have that big of an army.
420200	422200	It's a national psyche thing.
422200	426200	It's like they'll go, oh, there's this guy, there's that guy and then there's Belmont.
426200	428200	Belmont is the Swedish guy.
428200	429200	He's just a regular Joe.
429200	439200	So Dan, a Dane, a Norwegian and Belmont made a wager on who could remain inside a goat pen
439200	440200	the longest.
440200	441200	Right.
441200	442200	Okay.
442200	443200	Classic.
443200	444200	Belmont.
444200	445200	Okay.
445200	448200	This is your run of the mill Belmont joke.
448200	455600	First out was the Dane who came out just after 10 minutes yelling, damn, that goat stinks.
455600	457100	After him, the Norwegian went in.
457100	463200	After half an hour, he came out yelling, damn, that goat stinks.
463200	466320	Finally Belmont went in.
466320	473280	After two hours, the goat came rushing out saying, damn, that Belmont stinks.
473280	474280	Can I rewrite that?
474280	479880	Whatever it is, just say they should just say the goat came out.
479880	482640	He doesn't have to say, damn, that Belmont stinks.
482640	483640	Okay.
483640	492440	Well, Dan, maybe you haven't heard this one, a Russian, a Russian, a German and Belmont
492440	497680	wanted to see who could swim the fastest across the Atlantic ocean.
497680	500420	First out was the German, you know, of course.
500420	504080	He swam one kilometer and drowned.
504080	505600	Next came the Russian.
505600	509300	He swam 10 kilometers, he drowned.
509300	511160	Now it was Belmont's turn.
511160	518000	He swam and swam until he almost reached America, then he got tired and swam back.
518000	519000	Let's see.
519000	520000	Now that's a hero.
520000	521000	Yeah, right.
521000	525640	Sometimes Belmont, it's like a weird fusion of like in America, we're just like someone
525640	530600	has to be being shit on or whatever, but it's interesting to me that it's like ... So we
530600	532480	were like, oh, what an interesting joke format.
532480	534280	What an interesting thing.
534280	536760	Yeah, because it's not a Pollock joke.
536760	538320	It's not a N-bomb joke.
538320	539520	It's not a racist joke.
539520	543440	It's also not like a jingoistic like a fucking Swedes do it the best joke.
543440	545280	I got two questions.
545280	547040	Is Belmont a first or a last name?
547040	549280	I think I would say first, I guess.
549280	553920	Is it supposed to be a reference to their race or ethnic like is it supposed to be that's
553920	554920	us?
554920	555920	I think it's probably-
555920	558360	Because they put it in context with other people from countries.
558360	559360	So it's like-
559360	560360	Yeah, well, I think that's the joke.
560360	564360	Spencer, as far as Wikipedia is concerned, the jokes first became popular in the 19th
564360	570600	century and originally inspired the life of the poet and composer Carl Michael Bellman.
570600	574920	The first known Bellman joke survived in a book from 1835.
574920	576800	So it goes back that far.
576800	580600	So that's almost like just having Mr. Bean be a character in a joke.
580600	585480	Yeah, that's how we interpret it is that it's sort of like Fred Flintstone or if his name
585480	588720	was Kowalski or something.
588720	591840	We don't have a national identity like that.
591840	594120	We don't have like a Joe Blow.
594120	598600	He's so outside of having an identity though in these jokes because he's the third person
598600	602760	to be set up and he's the only one who's racism called that.
602760	603840	He's not a race.
603840	605820	He's kind of a disembodied character.
605820	607020	It's a neutral country.
607020	612020	Wait, that's Switzerland.
612020	619340	But isn't it sort of like you're Swedish and I think that's part of it though, as you'll
619340	623500	see in the Bellman joke that we wrote, thank you.
623500	625940	We took a half hour and we wrote a Bellman joke.
625940	626940	Well, no, let's be honest.
626940	628900	It took us nearly an hour, 45 minutes.
628900	631420	Okay, I'm going to see if I can come up with a Bellman joke.
631420	632420	All right.
632420	634780	Spencer, can you riff a Bellman?
634780	637900	Do you already think that you have a handle on that premise so well that you can do it?
637900	640260	No, I'll need a half hour to nearly an hour, I think.
640260	644020	Okay, well, it should take me about that time to tell ours because I'm not that good at
644020	646260	telling jokes, but I wrote down the bullet points.
646260	648900	Jeff and I took like an hour.
648900	654020	We wanted to see, could we make our friend Sofia the Swede laugh with a Bellman joke?
654020	656620	With a proper Swedish Bellman joke.
656620	659220	So here's what we did.
659220	660700	And take it or leave it.
660700	662900	I think we fucking nailed it.
662900	663900	We fucking did it.
663900	665940	I'm really proud of it.
665940	666940	She laughed.
666940	667940	She laughed.
667940	668940	She did some sort of reaction.
668940	669940	We told it.
669940	671500	We got to the punch line and she went, thank you.
671500	675700	It was kind of like she went over it like a pothole.
675700	680540	She couldn't believe that we updated and contemporized fucking Bellman jokes.
680540	686060	Okay, so you know my history with telling jokes, but this is like an evil, connival
686060	687060	fuck feat here.
687060	689420	No, this is where we might run into trouble.
689420	690420	You have it written down.
690420	691420	I do.
691420	692420	I have my bullet points.
692420	693420	Okay.
693420	694420	A good joke is somewhat rift.
694420	695420	Whoa.
695420	696420	Is that?
696420	697420	Is that us?
697420	698420	All right, all right.
698420	699420	Guys, you know, come on.
699420	700420	Give me like, I feel like a real Bellman right now.
700420	701420	I'm going to prove myself to be a Bellman because I'm going to come through in the end in a weird
701420	702420	way.
702420	703420	All right.
703420	704420	Just here's our Bellman joke.
704420	705420	Here it is.
705420	706420	Jeff and I wrote this at the drawing room.
706420	707420	It took us 45 minutes.
707420	708420	45 minutes.
708420	709420	It's the year 2020.
709420	710420	It's the year 2020.
710420	711420	It's the year 2020.
711420	712420	The year 2020.
712420	713420	The year 2020.
713420	714420	The year 2020.
714420	715420	The year 2020.
715420	716420	The year 2020.
716420	717420	The year 2020.
717420	718420	The year 2020.
718420	719420	The year 2020.
719420	720420	The year 2020.
721420	726420	It's the year 2019 AD.
726420	730420	Earth has made first contact with an alien species.
730420	737860	The message from this mysterious alien species is we are here to destroy you.
737860	743660	If you are not worthy, send three emissaries from your species.
743660	746780	Each can bring one item.
746780	749220	A lottery is held.
749220	752540	The emissaries are chosen.
752540	762420	A Dutch astronaut, a German astronaut and Bellman.
762420	769660	The astronauts are placed into the prescribed craft.
769660	775380	It is sent up to the mothership orbiting the earth.
775380	777980	The air lack opens.
777980	789440	The omnipotent, ominous aliens send their emissary into the vestibule of the ship.
789440	793300	Our astronauts enter with their items.
793300	795100	What have you brought?
795100	797100	Says the alien.
797100	799220	The Dutch astronaut steps forward.
799220	803460	I have brought this model of a windmill.
803460	809380	The Dutch were the first to harness the natural resources of the earth and although our species
809380	817220	currently lives in conflict with our planet, this is evidence that our people have it in
817220	825460	them as early as the dawn of civilization to live in harmony with mother Gaia.
825460	828060	What have you brought?
828060	837580	The German astronaut pulls out a pistol, says, this is a German Luger pistol.
837580	847900	It is the peak of German engineering, yes, it is war-based, but your species did say
847900	851620	you were here to destroy us if we didn't prove ourselves.
851620	857900	This is evidence that we have it in us to follow perfect order and have perfect hierarchy
857900	864540	and that the results can be this, this perfect piece of engineering that has literally never
864540	870820	misfired a shot, the German Luger.
870820	879500	And what have you, Belman, pulls out a camera, says, I brought a Hasselblad camera.
879500	881580	It's a Swedish camera.
881580	884820	It's state of the art.
884820	886200	Why?
886200	892680	Because nobody's going to believe this shit.
892680	894240	That's a good Belman joke.
894240	900240	Ladies and gentlemen, Belman, Belman, that's a good Belman joke.
900240	903320	And then I think the rest of it, as you can imagine, I think the aliens, like, I like
903320	907520	this guy, Planet Belman.
907520	912200	Or do they, do they kill, who do they, I don't know.
912200	915040	My favorite part of the joke is the denouement.
915040	920040	What happens after the Polish guy eats all of the pee-soaked popcorn instead of having
920040	922040	sex with the farmer's daughter?
922040	926120	I mean, certainly a stomach ache.
926120	927120	Yeah.
927120	930800	But like, let's say you put yourself in the pants.
930800	934240	If aliens wear pants, which one do you pick?
934240	937800	Do you pick the, the aliens that were here today?
937800	943120	The peaceful engineering of the Dutch, the warlike engineering of the Germans, or the
943120	946240	ironic, I get the joke, Belman.
946240	947240	They weren't here to pick.
947240	951640	They wanted to see if we had, if our civilization had generated a Belman.
951640	955560	You know, and I think when you're, when your species gets to the point where it's capable
955560	960160	of Belman production, you're like, okay, you're all right.
960160	964680	And probably another alien comes out and goes, I'm the alien equivalent of Belman.
964680	970000	Like long ago, people didn't understand a goofy horse sense.
970000	972560	Spencer, do you think you're ready for your Belman joke?
972560	973560	Or do you need some time?
973560	978280	I just want to say that I think that you really did what a scripted joke could not have accomplished
978280	981120	by going off book and using those, that outline.
981120	982240	So thank you.
982240	984840	I was, you elevated the material.
984840	985840	Yeah.
985840	987720	And I, and I don't think you're being sarcastic.
987720	990320	I'm not, but I could be.
990320	991320	Yeah.
991320	993080	But I choose to believe that you're not.
993080	999560	Well, yeah, I think the tension there is maybe your black outfit is blending into the background
999560	1001960	and you look like a disembodied ghost person.
1001960	1003360	I've always wished I would be.
1003360	1008480	Did I tell you guys that I imagined my head like running around, like, like it like hops
1008480	1015240	off my body and like runs around on little beard feet, you know, like, uh, did you have,
1015240	1016640	did you have a Belman joke?
1016640	1018080	Uh, I came up with one.
1018080	1020760	I'm not proud of it, but you know, that was the task.
1020760	1024120	If you come up with one that quickly, you don't have to be proud of it.
1024120	1027120	You can be proud that you came up with a Belman joke that quickly.
1027120	1028120	Okay.
1028120	1029120	Well, then I am.
1029120	1030120	All right.
1030120	1031120	All right.
1031280	1036120	A dwarf and Belman are outside of a dungeon.
1036120	1039760	As I say, I became a struggle outside of what?
1039760	1040760	A dungeon.
1040760	1041760	Okay.
1041760	1045680	And, uh, the elf goes like, I'm going to get that treasure and goes in there and then five
1045680	1048480	minutes later comes back out and he's like, Jesus Christ, there's no trees.
1048480	1049480	It's claustrophobic in there.
1049480	1050480	I can't hack it.
1050480	1053240	And the dwarf's like, haha, fucking elves.
1053240	1055760	And then the dwarf goes in there and then he comes out.
1055760	1059240	He's all scratched up and bloody and he's like, this place is full of orcs, man.
1059240	1060320	I'm not going back.
1060320	1061880	There's no way the treasure is worth that.
1061880	1064600	And then Belman is like, I got this, you guys.
1064600	1069040	And then he comes back like two hours later and he's just fine and everyone's like, what?
1069040	1070040	What?
1070040	1071040	What happened?
1071040	1072040	He's like, you guys were totally right, man.
1072040	1073840	There was like, the place was terrible.
1073840	1077360	There was like just a bunch of dusty coins and stuff.
1077360	1079000	You see?
1079000	1081000	Because he got the treasure, but he didn't care for it.
1081000	1082000	Right.
1082000	1083000	Oh, he didn't care.
1083000	1084000	He didn't like the treasure.
1084000	1087160	Because the Belman has a different, uh, standard.
1087160	1088160	Right.
1088160	1089160	Yeah.
1089320	1090320	That's fucking great.
1090320	1091320	No, it's not great.
1091320	1095640	It's it's certainly passes the test of being a Belman joke on some level.
1095640	1096880	I think it's not great.
1096880	1101320	One tweak would be, I think, if you, if, if each of them were specified as coming out
1101320	1102320	empty handed.
1102320	1107120	So that when Belman comes out empty handed and then he's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1107120	1108440	Uh, all right.
1108440	1113800	Well, I stuck to the script and that was my.
1113800	1116960	Our next guest needs no introduction.
1116960	1120120	He's been touring clubs and colleges all across the nation.
1120120	1125000	Um, you might've missed him on, uh, Jimmy Kimmel.
1125000	1131600	He's uh, he's been a good friend of mine for a long time and a good friend of the show
1131600	1134320	and a good friend of entertainment in general.
1134320	1137160	Please welcome Rob Schwab.
1137160	1144160	Oh no.
1144160	1147160	No.
1147160	1150160	No.
1150160	1153160	Fuck.
1153160	1156160	All right.
1156160	1162280	Rob, do you want to try to freestyle a Belman joke?
1162280	1168480	It's a tripartite joke where one person is either the hero or the dummy.
1168480	1170680	Hard to tell which.
1170680	1172600	It's kind of like the shrobbing of jokes.
1172600	1179480	I'm so, have you guys been having a hard time with 2018?
1179480	1186600	Yeah, that's gone pretty seamlessly for me so far.
1186600	1191960	I mean, I haven't, I've been having a 10, 10 shush, shush.
1191960	1194400	I haven't, haven't, is my mic on?
1194400	1200480	I've just, I haven't been a hard time getting up in the morning.
1200480	1201480	Like it was difficult.
1201480	1205640	It was difficult for me to come over here.
1205640	1211240	I have not really, I got a lot of work I could be doing and it's not even that much.
1211240	1216280	It's not even like an overwhelming workload, but I still, I've, I really am still in vacation
1216280	1217280	mode.
1217280	1221120	I, yeah, I'm having like a hard turn.
1221160	1222320	I'm having a hard turn.
1222320	1231080	I'm going through, I don't, I go to bed early, I sleep late, I'm, I don't go out, I'm home.
1231080	1233320	I order in a lot.
1233320	1242120	Does Kate, Kate goes, goes, plays magic cards and VR and hangs out in Malibu and it's just
1242120	1243920	me and the dog most of the time.
1243920	1246320	Cody and I are definitely enabling each other.
1246320	1250120	Like we just, every weekend we just, we can't wait to get to the weekend and then we jump
1250120	1253200	into bed and we just turn into fucking potatoes.
1253200	1254200	We just don't move.
1254200	1255680	I've been doing that a lot.
1255680	1256800	But you're doing it regardless.
1256800	1261240	You know, Kate's going like, okay, I'm going to Malibu to play magic, and you're like,
1261240	1263760	I've been also meditating.
1263760	1269600	I've been meditating a lot, which is, I'm taking a nap for how long?
1269600	1276480	Like I'll, like I'll set my insight timer for 20 minutes, but I'll, I'll set the, the
1276480	1277480	alarm.
1277480	1279160	If you meditate too long, you could go crazy.
1279160	1280720	You know, have you read about that?
1280720	1281720	No.
1281720	1285040	I mean, it has to be in the neighborhood of like 48 hours.
1285040	1286040	Don't worry about it.
1286040	1287040	Okay.
1287040	1292480	A Buddhist, a Hindu and a Belmont, go to Nirvana, start meditating.
1292480	1297360	And they try to achieve Nirvana together and the Hindu says, I'll go into Nirvana first.
1297360	1301920	I've been taking transcendental meditation classes.
1301920	1302920	You've been taking what?
1302920	1305000	Transcendental meditation classes.
1305000	1306000	Oh, okay.
1306000	1307000	Yeah.
1307000	1308360	I went to one of those orientations for that.
1308560	1309560	Oh yeah.
1309560	1310560	It's like right around the block from.
1310560	1311560	Yeah.
1311560	1312560	Jonah Ray was there.
1312560	1313560	Oh really?
1313560	1315720	I'm sure he doesn't mind me saying that.
1315720	1319480	He was put up to it by Joel Hodgson, our good friend, who's like, really, was really
1319480	1320480	into TM.
1320480	1321480	Yeah.
1321480	1322480	You know what?
1322480	1323480	It's the fucking best buddy.
1323480	1329520	He told me like three years ago, he goes, I think you really need to be doing this man.
1329520	1336180	I think, I think with your like the way your mind works, you gotta get up inside that mother
1336180	1337180	grabber.
1337180	1338180	Yeah.
1339180	1343180	You guys got it really down into it now.
1343180	1344180	So I did it.
1344180	1348240	I really, I enjoyed it, but I bet you grab that mother.
1348240	1350660	I grabbed a mother.
1350660	1353180	I can't remember why Cody and I didn't go back.
1353180	1359420	It wasn't like, I think it was just like, I think it, Oh, you know what?
1359420	1364540	It was because they said you can't get high and Cody was like, peace, like in general
1364540	1365540	or before.
1365540	1366540	No, no.
1366540	1369700	Like you have to, like you're not supposed to get high.
1369700	1374660	They said, you know, to get like an actual, you know, as you start out, it wasn't like
1374660	1380300	for the rest of your life, it was like, yeah, if you're going to do this, you're going to,
1380300	1388660	you know, to get a, a, a proper version of what hopefully will help you try not to drink
1388660	1390740	or get high or whatever.
1390740	1394700	Or they even said, don't take a nap before, you know, just little things like that.
1394700	1396100	No, I know it was temporary.
1396100	1398660	It wasn't like, but still deal breaker.
1398660	1399660	Yeah.
1399660	1404020	Like we're not having kids because I think, you know, like Cody was like, well, maybe
1404020	1405020	we should freeze our eggs.
1405020	1406020	That's extreme.
1406020	1407020	And there you go.
1407020	1408020	Okay.
1408020	1409020	Step one to freeze your eggs.
1409020	1410020	Don't get high for that.
1410020	1411020	Done.
1411020	1412020	Forget it.
1412020	1413020	Peace.
1413020	1415500	You, you two really like getting high.
1415500	1416500	I really like Cody.
1416500	1417780	She really, really likes getting high.
1417780	1421660	I should get high more than drink less.
1421660	1424420	I get high and then I go to bed.
1424420	1425420	Yeah.
1425540	1426540	Yeah.
1426540	1427540	Me too.
1427540	1429380	I eat and then I go to bed.
1429380	1432100	I turn on the television and I go to bed.
1432100	1433100	Yeah, man.
1433100	1434100	I'm falling apart.
1434100	1435100	No, man.
1435100	1436420	This is a cry for help.
1436420	1437420	You're just sleeping.
1437420	1439020	What are you supposed to, what do you want to do?
1439020	1443020	You want to be a CG head in the bucket list, like falling out of a plane?
1443020	1447260	Like, like what, don't, don't let people trick you into thinking that life is about going
1447260	1449980	outside or, or flying a kite.
1449980	1450980	Like what the fuck?
1450980	1451980	Who cares?
1451980	1452980	Those people are morons.
1452980	1453980	I'm not happy though.
1453980	1454980	Oh, okay.
1454980	1455980	Let's see.
1455980	1456980	That's, that's it.
1456980	1460740	But, but, but, but in case you're not happy because you think you should be doing something
1460740	1463300	else, that could be, that could be part of the whole syndrome.
1463300	1464300	That's probably, that's a little bit of it too.
1464300	1468180	I think if you step on the gas and go, I want to be in bed, you know, that's how I quit
1468180	1469180	smoking.
1469180	1470180	It was like, I'm going to fucking smoke this cigarette.
1470180	1472780	I'm going to smoke the shit out of this fucking cigarette.
1472780	1478260	Like I'm sick and tired of pretending I'm trying to quit or resenting people for telling
1478260	1479260	me I should quit.
1479260	1480260	It's like, I'm smoking.
1480260	1481260	Okay.
1481260	1483500	I'm going to smoke this cigarette and I'd look at each cigarette and I'd go like, get
1483500	1485580	ready to get smoked, you little fuck.
1485580	1489260	And I'd smoke it and I'd be like, and then I, that, that, that was the first step down
1489260	1491740	the road to getting to quit smoking.
1491740	1492740	Right.
1492740	1493740	Like being intentional.
1493740	1494740	Yeah.
1494740	1499980	Just being aware is like, instead of pretending and you're being unconscious about things,
1499980	1505620	you know, not wanting to face things is a big, that seals off a mental process that
1505620	1510260	could just make thoughts like magnify and, and, but simultaneously they're sealed off.
1510260	1512700	So you're not even knowing they're magnified.
1512700	1518300	That's where you get your classic guy, you know, sipping coffee and, and, and then the,
1518300	1523260	they run out of Splenda and he takes a knife out and kills everybody because the classic.
1523260	1524260	Yeah.
1524260	1525260	You know, it's just that thing.
1525260	1527540	That's like, what are you unhappy about Rob?
1527540	1531220	I don't just unfulfilled, you know, professionally, probably, right?
1531220	1535700	Not creatively or both because usually there's creative and professional and they're kind
1535700	1537340	of not necessarily the same.
1537340	1541100	I, I just, it's not fun anymore.
1541100	1542100	Right.
1542100	1543100	Yeah.
1543100	1549020	And I, I miss that and, you know, and everybody wants to help and say, well, you got to go
1549020	1551460	out and you got to read, you got to do some stuff.
1551460	1556620	You can't just like, and yeah, I know, but that doesn't, it doesn't help.
1556620	1557620	I don't want to help.
1557620	1561660	I want, I want you to, I want you to fucking pop like a, because I know it'll be great.
1561660	1566060	You know, it's like, I want you to get so fucking sad and angry and sick of the world
1566060	1571420	and selfish and that you take all of that talent that you can't escape and just fucking
1571420	1577220	smash it like Eddie Van Halen guitar and like create some crazy new form of music that,
1577220	1578220	you know, no pressure.
1578220	1583100	But I, I just, you know, I, I, I just like, I like making little animations and put them
1583100	1584220	on Instagram or whatever.
1584220	1589180	Like you're, you, I think you need to do what Justin did when he, when he, you know, when
1589180	1593540	he started doing the voices that became Rick and Morty, it was because he was like, he
1593540	1599020	was mad and lonely and sad and like he hated like working and like he, he, and he just
1599020	1601020	wanted to take a shit on back to the future.
1601020	1606460	It's like, he just, he just, he's just alienated, you know, it's like, just follow it.
1606460	1609340	Like think about how fucking much you hate everybody.
1609340	1610340	Like they're stupid.
1610340	1611340	They're control of your life.
1611340	1613340	I don't want to hate anybody.
1613340	1618620	I just, I just, um, it's, it's just getting, it's like, you, how much you hate yourself
1618620	1619620	then?
1619620	1620620	Oh, okay.
1620620	1621620	All right.
1621700	1628780	It's like waking up and going, this again, yeah, this, this, this, I got, I got, I got
1628780	1634300	12 hours of this before I, it's okay for me to go back to sleep, go back to bed.
1634300	1635300	We'll capture that.
1635300	1640900	That's already, I'm already, I'm already captivated by your, your expressing it.
1640900	1642220	You're always going to be an artist.
1642220	1647500	Like I, I, the guy that, you know, you know how a guy at a Dunkin Donuts says what you
1647500	1648500	just said.
1648500	1651580	He says something that he heard on a television.
1651580	1656100	He says same shit, different day and he, and then he, and then he raped somebody.
1656100	1658260	I don't want to rape anyone.
1658260	1660540	What would be the, the, uh, like the dream?
1660540	1661540	I don't know.
1661540	1662540	That's the thing.
1662540	1666820	If you woke up and said, oh, I'm creating, I'm working, I'm doing this thing, what would
1666820	1667820	that mean?
1667820	1668820	I don't know.
1668820	1669820	I don't know what that would be.
1669820	1672700	I mean, I literally can do whatever I want right now.
1672700	1676940	I mean, I, I, I'm sitting on a ton of savings.
1676940	1678780	I don't have many expenses.
1678780	1681700	I could jump on a plane and go anywhere I want.
1681700	1686980	I could invest all my money into something and I just, I'm like, I don't know.
1686980	1690420	It's just this severe, sad apathy.
1690420	1694020	I vote for going exact same way except without as much money.
1694020	1695820	I mean, certainly I'm more comfortable than I have.
1695820	1699420	You could get on like a twin prop and go a couple places in California.
1699420	1700660	Let's go like fly.
1700660	1708260	I vote for going like, like, like, like following your assessment of the monotony though.
1708260	1713220	I think that that's how caterpillars start to spin a cocoon that you feel sluggish, you're
1713220	1714220	full of leaves.
1714220	1715820	You don't want to eat them anymore.
1715820	1717740	You have all the energy you need.
1717740	1722660	It's just all like your metabolism is down and a transformation is about to happen.
1722660	1726600	And the caterpillar, we don't want our, if we like our butterflies, we don't want our
1726600	1731180	caterpillars like forcing themselves to go to yoga when they feel that way.
1731180	1739140	We want them to like double down on that feeling because locked somewhere in there
1739140	1743700	is the beginning of a new phase.
1743700	1753820	You're lucky to have a logical stopping point emotionally where things just feel like, okay.
1753820	1755380	I think that can be incredibly depressing.
1755380	1760020	You know, when you finish a draft, you finish a job, like there's that postpartum depression
1760020	1764400	because it, but it's like, it's cause you're done with one thing and you haven't started
1764400	1766320	another yet and you feel useless.
1766320	1768000	And I know that's not what you're feeling right now.
1768000	1772680	You feel like it's in a larger scale, but I'm saying that's because you're, you're,
1772680	1777400	the project that you finished isn't as simple as, oh, I just did this thing with JJ Abrams
1777400	1780120	and now I got to look for another job.
1780120	1785000	It's a chapter of your life that is ending and that, and that it could be a regression
1785000	1786000	to childhood.
1786000	1793380	Like you may need to get your, uh, your little cardboard, uh, things back out and fucking
1793380	1798900	and, and I would say instead of forcing yourself, I'm going to, I'm going to make like a new
1798900	1799900	franchise.
1799900	1802340	I'm going to, I'm going to do this amazing thing.
1802340	1804100	Like I like this.
1804100	1809220	I like this thought of you turning your gaze on the clockwork of life where you're like
1809220	1813460	looking at how pointless it all is and you're going like, this is what life is.
1813460	1819400	This is like, I'm like killing time between naps and I can't get out of bed and like time
1819400	1822360	means nothing and life means nothing and all this stuff.
1822360	1825360	I'd love to see your blue period, you know?
1825360	1826360	Yeah.
1826360	1827360	Yeah.
1827360	1833320	I mean, I mean, I've been thinking about that like a lot, like in the last year, just like,
1833320	1834840	what do I really want to be doing?
1834840	1841920	You know, you've had, I've had this trajectory of doing a certain living a certain life,
1841920	1846340	you know, since I was like eight years old, you know, and I'm living it and I've done
1846340	1853380	pretty much everything I've ever set out to do, at least tasted it and, and now I'm like,
1853380	1855820	well, wasn't that great?
1855820	1857340	Well, it's great.
1857340	1858340	It's fine.
1858340	1859340	But where's the surprise?
1859340	1864780	Where's the, where's the person that said, Oh, I'm instead, I, I, one day, you know,
1864780	1868900	I mean like the, the, the, you hear the story of somebody doing the opposite of what we're
1868900	1874120	doing, you know, the lawyer that said, I, I want to write, uh, the, the diehard three,
1874120	1877760	you know, like, and goes out and does it, you know, and leaves that world behind and
1877760	1878960	becomes a creative.
1878960	1884820	Like what's the opposite of the creative person who has done nothing but being creative this
1884820	1886880	entire life, even for fun.
1886880	1892960	Do you think as a version of you, Rob, that even if you wrote the perfect thing, got all
1892960	1895560	the kudos for it, that that would make you happy?
1896020	1901440	Well, I've already done that and, and, and it, and it's, it's, it's, it makes you happy,
1901440	1905180	but being happy and being satisfied are not necessarily the same thing.
1905180	1906180	Satisfied.
1906180	1911720	Like, like, what, like, is there a version where you go, Oh, I did, I crossed a finish
1911720	1914900	line that made me feel satisfied.
1914900	1919140	Like is, is there a work thing, a drawing that you could do a movie, you could write
1919140	1925540	a award, you could win that you would cross that threshold and go, Oh, I feel good.
1926040	1928360	I, I miss being proud.
1930960	1931720	But I don't know.
1931720	1936000	I mean, you know, like, I just, you know, there's some things that you go out and you
1936000	1940780	know, you do something and you're like, I did that because it's a job or I, you know,
1940780	1946640	I do this and it, it went so far and it was great for that, but then it just didn't go
1946640	1952120	over that, that, that next step to get to out into the public or whatever.
1952140	1953700	But I, I feel the same too.
1953700	1961420	It's like I, you know, there's fake thresholds I thought that I would have crossed by now,
1961420	1967660	but I'm just happy now to make a living, like doing like what I like, and that's, I'm
1967660	1975700	in the very lucky percentage of people that get to do that, but you're more artistic
1975720	1982240	than I am, like your, like your book, like, but I, but I can't do anything else.
1982280	1984360	It's like you draw and you didn't even like it.
1985360	1989200	Like you draw because you have to, because what else are you going to fuck?
1989240	1989680	Yeah.
1989800	1990100	Yeah.
1990520	1994720	Well, that's why I think, I mean, there's, there's those two levels of, it's like you
1994720	1998800	and I have been on both tracks at various stages of, of our careers.
1998880	2003960	There's the track where, um, there's all this artificial outside encouragement
2004020	2010260	where people are calling and going like, how'd you like to meet with Gwyneth
2010380	2014020	Johnson Berg and, and you're like, Gwyneth, okay.
2014020	2018340	And then she's like, I want, I, I've always wanted, I've always been into, uh,
2018380	2023100	slinkies and, and, and slinky is interested in, and, and then you, you, you
2023100	2027260	get to get out of bed every day and go like, Oh, well, you know, I'm going to, I'm
2027260	2029380	going to fucking blow people's mind by making this best slinky movie.
2029400	2034240	And you have all these outside like things and it's like, it's like
2034240	2036460	carbohydrates, like it fills your blood sugar.
2036800	2040320	And then, and you, as long as you keep stuffing your face with Snickers bars,
2040320	2042760	you don't know that you're running on purely blood sugar.
2043000	2045340	And then two, one of two things happen.
2045800	2049360	You run out of Snickers and you get starving or you get really fat and you're
2049360	2054320	also unhappy because you're working 50 jobs for Gwyneth Johnson Berg and slinky.
2054520	2056380	And none of them are passionate.
2056380	2059200	And that's like, again, you're just like, you just feel like
2059220	2060700	you're, you're miserable.
2061240	2064640	And then, then there's the Atkins diet of creativity.
2064640	2069220	This is a bad metaphor because you're vegetarian, uh, but, uh, but it's
2069220	2075300	like, it's that other thing of like, you know, and, and you know, like, like, like
2075300	2079720	what Jeff had said, like, is, is this about, is this about profession or is
2079720	2085020	this about, uh, uh, creative because they are, they can be two different things.
2085020	2088860	And I think you're, you're, you're well aware of the fact that you don't
2088860	2093660	want Robert De Niro to drop through a skylight and be like, I, I want you to
2093660	2095900	make a bullwinkle movie with me.
2095900	2097900	Like that's not going to make you happy right now.
2098480	2100520	And, and you don't need it.
2100780	2105960	And, and so it's like, I think it's like, it's the other things
2105960	2107100	that we're talking about.
2107100	2111380	Like you feel like when Eddie Murphy went up at the house of blues and started
2111380	2114540	singing about how he didn't feel like he was funny anymore, but after Pluto and
2114540	2119460	Ash or something, like you're, you're feeling midlife, like, uh, creative crisis.
2119460	2119820	Yeah.
2119820	2126540	You know, it's, it's, uh, uh, you know, it's like, you get the, the phone calls
2126540	2129700	from, you know, like, Hey, there's a meeting.
2129700	2130860	These people want to meet you.
2130860	2136180	And you're just like, no, no, I don't, I don't want to, whoa, why not?
2136220	2142300	I just don't feel like driving to San Diego, getting stuck in traffic for
2142420	2144340	something that's a meet and greet.
2144340	2148060	That's just not going to go anywhere or anywhere.
2148060	2153780	I want to, you know, to do the fucking captain crunch movie or, you
2153780	2158060	know, the electrician's a serial killer movie.
2158100	2161860	Are you feeling, Rob, are you feeling more creative or less creative?
2161860	2163540	Now, do you, do you feel dead?
2163900	2169940	I'm feeling done and it's, and it's hard because if it was just living
2169980	2177860	alone, but I have my insecurities about my, my wife, who's younger than me,
2177940	2182060	you know, going, I didn't sign up for this.
2182540	2184900	I didn't sign up to, to live with a zombie.
2185020	2187820	Well, I mean, that goes back and forth.
2187860	2191180	She'll, she'll be drawing checks from the account of your relationship.
2191260	2195100	At some point when she's feeling down, she, she loves you.
2195140	2197060	She's not, she did sign up for this.
2197060	2203660	She, she doesn't, she didn't have a preconceived, like she didn't want you
2203660	2206020	to be energetic when she married you.
2206020	2206700	She wasn't going.
2206700	2210700	I've been with you for seven years, but I, like, I have this condition.
2210700	2214860	I'm not sharing in my vows, which is that I want you to be bubbly every day.
2215060	2216220	She, she's a creator too.
2216220	2219740	Like, like she makes stuff and also like she has to deal with her
2219740	2222900	own like ups and downs in the creative process.
2222900	2226100	Like, like she doesn't work at a bakery.
2226180	2229820	She also wants to make things and she's a creator and you, you're
2229820	2231300	both dealing with the same.
2231340	2234620	We're going to get so many tweets from people at Dunkin Donuts and bakeries.
2234700	2240300	Like they've twice now been used as a, as an, as an example of people
2240300	2245780	that, uh, have no point to live and are contributing nothing.
2246460	2249980	I'm going to get that usual tweet from the fight for 15 minimum wage,
2250020	2252980	socialist people, if I may.
2252980	2258060	Like you, you sent a pretty dark tweet out today where you said you
2258060	2259300	wanted to die, you're done.
2260100	2261500	This is like playing prices, right?
2261540	2266060	But it's like the price of life and the closer to zero you get you.
2267900	2272020	Is it, is it, was that a joke or a creative like, like desperation or just
2272020	2273900	a rare, it was really funny, right?
2273900	2274780	Wasn't it hilarious?
2274780	2275500	Hilarious.
2275540	2280580	What was it like, man, that is classic setup payoff.
2280740	2281420	Oh boy.
2281820	2282660	Yeah, no, I don't know.
2283780	2284340	It was bad.
2284340	2285220	I'm in a bad place.
2285220	2286860	I, like I said, I feel like Rob does.
2286900	2290300	I feel, I feel I identify very strongly with everything you're saying.
2290620	2290900	I don't know.
2290900	2294940	I had the thought that, and this may or may not make any sense, but like the
2294940	2299340	whole concept of a midlife crisis, it might be like this biological, uh,
2299900	2300380	what do you call it?
2300380	2301660	Reproduction instinct.
2301660	2306220	Like, like after you go so far, suddenly the light goes out of the world and it
2306220	2309660	kind of becomes gray and the reason it becomes gray is because then you can
2309660	2311500	see the world fresh new color.
2311500	2315460	Once you have a kid, it kind of basically it's like new game plus on the
2315460	2319780	world and it kind of just changes your perspective and lets you kind of become
2319780	2322660	comfortable with the idea of it's not about my happiness.
2322660	2324900	It's not about me being the protagonist in the world.
2324900	2328700	It's about being part of this community that is then putting forth new
2328700	2329860	people that are then the new.
2330220	2334700	You're looking at things that are going to stale through fresh eyes.
2334700	2338740	It's like when you're a fan of like say Star Trek or Dungeons and Dragons and
2338740	2340900	you're teaching somebody who's never done it before.
2340900	2341660	It's boom.
2341940	2345540	It's just like, so you have a kid and you go, this is Christmas.
2345540	2346500	This is Easter.
2346500	2347460	It's got a whole new line.
2347500	2348660	It's like the second chapter.
2348660	2352540	Like it's, it's this everything about your life you get to redo.
2352660	2358300	But I've been having midlife crisis is sees my entire life.
2358340	2358660	Yeah.
2358660	2360300	But I think I was like 14.
2360300	2360820	30, right?
2360820	2362020	He's gone through a lot of midlife.
2362020	2362300	Yeah.
2362340	2362980	Yes.
2363060	2364460	You're like the cat of middle age.
2364700	2365060	Yes.
2365060	2368220	Um, yeah, I think it, well, I think it has something to do
2368260	2374940	with, I think I, a typical Dunkin Donuts of shit eating bakery worker.
2375940	2379860	Dan, let's lay off the donuts for a while.
2380020	2385140	Um, uh, they, they, they, they, we, you know, Time magazine can identify one
2385140	2388860	midlife and one midlife crisis and creatives are constantly dying and
2388860	2390180	resurrecting in their minds.
2390860	2394780	I think that, I think that you guys are hitting the nail on the head because
2394780	2396540	it all has to do with the future.
2396780	2400140	When you're 25, you don't really realize that what's keeping you
2400140	2406300	going is thinking unconsciously about how life's going to be when you're 35.
2406700	2411500	Like you, you, you, you, it's just, it's that energy just permeates you.
2411820	2415580	Even though if anyone asked you and you consciously answered the question,
2415940	2420300	like, so what's it like being so young and like having your whole life
2420300	2423020	ahead of you, you would, you, we were all there.
2423020	2425860	We would grouse and be like, what do you mean my whole life?
2425900	2430580	I was, I, I should have done something by the time I was 21 a blah, blah, blah.
2430580	2433500	Like, and also even if you, even if you were an optimistic person, you'd be
2433500	2435420	like, look, I'm not a materialist.
2435420	2437180	So I don't care about the future.
2437180	2438660	I don't care what's going to happen.
2438660	2439620	I'm not thinking about that.
2439940	2445780	And you'd pass a polygraph test, but when you get to 35, you then start to
2445780	2452100	realize that you, oh, I say something's there's, there's some tank that's
2452100	2454620	emptying here and I can't quite put my finger on it.
2454860	2460060	And then you get to 45 and you're like, aha, I know what that tank is.
2460060	2462180	That tank is thinking about the future.
2462180	2465340	It's, it's, it's, it is just the idea of the future.
2465700	2470380	Um, but here's the glorious invitation that that represents it because this
2470380	2474100	isn't an epiphany we're having when we're 70, which would be fine to have
2474100	2475700	it then like unforgiven.
2475700	2478500	We could take a shotgun into town and just blow everyone away in the rain.
2478700	2485100	But, uh, the, to have it when you're truly middle-aged is to, is to truly say,
2485340	2489140	oh, my, my thought about the future tank is empty.
2489740	2491380	That's a good tank to be empty.
2491700	2495940	It's like going into ketosis and I was like, I am now going to have to
2495940	2497540	actually live off of the moment.
2497780	2499340	And Jeff is saying that in one way.
2499340	2500180	He's an actor.
2500420	2505300	He's, he's, he's going like, he, he broke through to I'm just wandering
2505300	2509780	minstrel and I want to, I've, I've found joy in like, so send me on a plane
2509780	2511300	to India, send me here.
2511300	2514140	Like, as long as I'm always working with people that I, that I love and I'm
2514140	2517940	getting paid to do what I love and I don't have to work in a shit hole bakery
2518140	2523340	with the fucking disgusting bakers talking to you, Duncan donuts, talking
2523340	2524980	to you, bakers of America.
2524980	2531300	You gross fucking who yeasts shit who wants to be a fucking baker.
2531300	2537340	You disgusting milk fed fucking 90 IQ donut wranglers.
2537340	2541980	You tell me what yeast even is bakers and I'll fucking give you a doughnut.
2542100	2543980	I'll tell you what's, what's not rising.
2544100	2546980	Uh, your life, you pieces of shit.
2548540	2550820	And I, there will be no comeuppance for this.
2550860	2553460	There will never be a working class revolution in this country.
2553620	2553980	All right.
2554380	2557300	Um, but, but we should keep saying that.
2557620	2559100	I think that might be a good idea.
2559700	2562660	They're like, just angrily, there'll never like, just in public, there'll
2562660	2564580	never be a working class uprising.
2564820	2566980	Just get enough people to say that.
2566980	2570020	And people, all these teenagers are like, what the fuck does this guy know?
2570700	2571940	Like we're going to fucking riot.
2573380	2574300	I think that could work.
2574300	2577580	I mean, it's a joke, but I think it works of not having a mask.
2577700	2582940	No, uh, anyways, but Jeff, I mean, it, it, that, that, that's what we
2582940	2588060	need to get through to is, is, is, is, is that, is just that.
2588380	2592860	I'm waking up and, and there's a depressing way of saying it that you're
2592860	2597540	waking up and there's nothing to, and then there's also a really, you know,
2597580	2602740	there, there's definitely a way that you could go, you know, Oh man, this is heaven.
2603260	2607340	The things that I've always wanted to do, I've done.
2608220	2610900	And I'm kind of sick of it.
2610940	2615460	You know, I'm kind of sick of my own shit, you know, but at the same time I
2615460	2618980	could go, but now's the time to change.
2619180	2621060	You know, now's the time to do something different.
2621060	2623940	Now's the time to invent a new style.
2623980	2629060	I'll tell you something you've always had over me is like, I've never had the balls
2629060	2634740	to say no to the Clifford, the big red dog meeting or the, uh, so-and-so wants
2634740	2639700	to meet you, I'm all, I, I, I, I, I can't shake this terror, but I need to.
2639940	2643860	It's being forced upon me that I need to, because, um, I, I've done nothing,
2643860	2647300	but, you know, spread myself thin and botch a bunch of projects.
2647740	2654780	Like I, I need to just say no, thank you to the Jenga, uh, phone call, the Jenga
2654780	2658540	movie, like, like, like, like, like I, but instead I just keep going like, well,
2658580	2661540	do you think he'll set it in the future and taking that call?
2661540	2665220	And then like, and then of course he says yes, but he's lying, you know, like
2665220	2670100	either you go into the fucking Jenga office and in, in, in, in Sino.
2670100	2672580	And I just, I just, I, I can't do-
2672580	2674260	Is that a riff or is there actually a-
2674260	2675900	It's based in truth.
2675940	2685700	I can't, I can't, it's so hard to do anything creative, uh, for me, uh, that I
2685700	2690100	can't do it unless I love it and I got to figure out a way to love it.
2690100	2692580	If I could figure out a way to love it, I'll, I'll do it.
2692580	2695940	But if I can't, I'm like, I'm waiting everybody's time.
2696420	2704580	So yeah, I don't work as often as I probably could, and I could have a bigger
2704580	2710580	savings account than I do, but I just kind of, I do what I, whatever I want,
2710580	2715300	you know, and right now I'm like in a scary place because I, you know, this
2715300	2720340	is what depression feels like is, is like, I don't want to do anything ever again.
2720380	2722580	And I feel like it's going to be ever again.
2722620	2725420	And then eventually my wife's going to leave me.
2725500	2726620	My dog's going to die.
2726620	2728780	I'm going to have a no savings account.
2728780	2731980	And you're just going to bury me in that apartment that I've been living in for
2731980	2734340	the last 20 years, because I'm afraid to move out.
2736060	2738020	Maybe you'll feel better if I do a rap.
2738300	2738700	Hit it.
2739900	2740860	Zach, you got a beat.
2741780	2748500	Belmont, Belmont, Belmont, Belmont, Belmont, Belmont, Belmont, you know,
2748580	2754580	a Russian, Belmont, you know, and Belmont, you know, and Belmont walking to, I got
2754580	2760380	in a canoe, I rode it to your house and I got out my shoe and I, I squatted over it
2760380	2765180	and I took a poo and then I had a shoe filled with poo in my canoe and I gave it
2765180	2767500	to you and you said, what you going to do?
2767500	2772500	And I said, I'm going to take another poo in my canoe and I threw my shoe and it
2772500	2777220	went over there and I, I saw your mama with her bright red hair and I said,
2777340	2779940	Goddamn.
2779940	2781420	Pookin' new.
2781420	2782620	Thundercats.

2796380	2797660	Leotard.
2797660	2800260	I'm flashing back to 10 years old.
2800260	2800820	All right.
2800820	2802500	Get away from that area.
2802500	2805100	Tricky bad area.

2814020	2814820	There it is.
2814820	2815940	Nope.
2815940	2816900	Pookin' new.
2816900	2817900	All right.
2817900	2819300	What?

2821940	2823020	Pookin' new.

2824740	2826740	A rubber canoe.
2826740	2826980	All right.
2826980	2828260	You're giving me, you're giving me stuff.
2828260	2829740	Depression, depression, depression, depression.
2829740	2830620	OK, depression.

2848940	2854580	D to the E to the P-R-E to the S-S-I and the O-N-E.
2854580	2856100	That's depression in French.
2856100	2859380	What the fuck?
2859380	2860900	Chocolate mint ice cream.
2860900	2863340	Chocolate mint ice cream is the here to say.
2863340	2866620	Donuts.
2866620	2867100	Donut.
2867100	2872140	Donut, donut, donut, donut, donut, donut, donut, donut, donut.
2872140	2872940	Industry.

2873540	2874540	Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK, good.
2874540	2875860	Yeah, let's pump those bakers back up.
2875860	2877180	Take them down, let's talk about it.
2877180	2881580	Yo, yo, I wake up in the morning and I make the dough.
2881580	2884540	I got to roll it all around like the shit was snow.
2884540	2888180	And I'm not making a man and I'm not making an igloo.
2888180	2891900	I'm making things that you need to eat to do what you do.
2891900	2895660	So you'd be able to thank me for giving you fuel
2895660	2897980	so you could go off and then your spankings.
2897980	2900140	Because you're a professional spanker,
2900140	2903020	or you're a carpenter, or you're a banker.
2903020	2907180	I'm just a lowly donut maker, but you shit down on me
2907180	2909380	because the shit rolls downhill.
2909380	2910660	Fuck you.
2910660	2912540	I'm sorry, I'm not Dr. Phil.
2912540	2913620	Why is he so great?
2913620	2914700	You hate him.
2914700	2918060	So what do you work at a gym?
2918060	2919420	I make fucking donuts.
2919420	2921700	You just make the opposite of them by working at a gym
2921780	2923020	if you think about it.
2923020	2924260	It's a weird cycle.
2924260	2926580	I make the donuts and then you go to the gym
2926580	2931580	and then you make the donuts come out of your body.
2933420	2938420	Yo, thunder cats, ho.
2941900	2945180	Thunder cats rap, thunder cats rap.
2945180	2947660	Lord of omens, give me sight, be on sight.
2947660	2950460	I fucked your mama so hard that I made it less tight
2950540	2953900	that I found Snark and said, what are you doing?
2953900	2955020	And he said, Snarf.
2955020	2957140	And I said, I'm sorry, I got your name wrong.
2958540	2959380	Pantera.
2960220	2961180	Pantera.
2961180	2962300	Was uncomfortable.
2963500	2964860	That was good.
2964860	2965700	All right.
2965700	2966540	That was good, I mean.
2966540	2967380	That was a good one.
2967380	2969020	I feel, I feel bad.
2969020	2971420	Rob, do you feel, do you feel more activated
2971420	2972940	as a creator now after that?
2972940	2973780	I think so, yeah.
2973780	2975980	I mean, I thought maybe there would be some.
2975980	2977340	I think so.
2977340	2981340	I thought maybe if I stirred the pot a little bit,
2981340	2984300	there would be some creative energies.
2984300	2986260	Like maybe we would all go, oh yeah,
2986260	2987460	we should talk about thunder cats.
2987460	2989100	What was going on in that cartoon?
2991860	2995420	I think Pantera and Chitara were an item.
2996940	2999700	Like, I don't think, I think they were keeping it quiet
2999700	3000980	because the kids were around.
3000980	3001820	Yeah, because kids.
3001820	3003620	But they would, they would always kind of like.
3003620	3006620	Because wily cat and wily cat were always around too much
3006620	3009300	and you know that Pantera, if he had his moment.
3009300	3010580	I said Pantera.
3010580	3012020	Yeah, Pantera's a band.
3012020	3014380	I can't believe I've lost all of the thunder cats.
3014380	3015700	I'm losing my thunder cats.
3015700	3017420	Name all of the thunder cats.
3017420	3018820	Lionel.
3018820	3019660	Lionel?
3019660	3020480	Lionel.
3020480	3021320	The train.
3021320	3022160	Lionel.
3022160	3023000	Lionel.
3023000	3023820	Right.
3023820	3024660	Panthro.
3024660	3025480	Panthro.
3025480	3026320	Chitara.
3026320	3027140	Boing.
3027140	3028500	Now it's gonna get harder.
3028500	3032340	Okay, Tigro.
3032340	3033180	I don't think so.
3033180	3034020	Tigro?
3034020	3035020	Latigra?
3035020	3035860	No.
3036620	3037980	There was a fucking tiger.
3037980	3039020	What was his name?
3040300	3041700	Troder?
3041700	3042940	Oh.
3042940	3043780	Troder.
3043780	3044620	What was the tiger?
3044620	3045540	Wait, why are you guys high-roading me?
3045540	3046820	I don't think that's his name.
3046820	3048700	What was the tiger's name?
3048700	3051300	We're not high-roading you by thinking you're wrong.
3051300	3052260	Tigro.
3052260	3053100	Okay.
3053100	3053940	Tigro.
3053940	3056060	Panthro, Lionel, Chitara.
3056060	3058980	They feminized her name and then it would be Tigro.
3058980	3060900	And what are the kids?
3060900	3062140	Whitful and Wenful.
3062140	3063820	Yeah, I don't know.
3063820	3064860	I forgot there were kids.
3064900	3065860	I just said them.
3065860	3067100	What was the...
3067100	3067940	I know you did, but I forgot.
3067940	3071380	And then there was a Obi-Wan kind of ghost guy.
3071380	3072220	Mumra.
3072220	3073580	No, that was the bad person.
3073580	3074420	Oh, that was...
3074420	3075260	Yeah, I don't know who this is.
3075260	3076100	It's not a fucking...
3076100	3076940	Okay.
3076940	3077780	All right.
3077780	3078620	Orko.

3141380	3142660	You know, that was a bad problem.
3142660	3143580	He was a strong one.
3143580	3144700	The only Smurf for you.
3144700	3145540	Papa.
3145540	3146380	It's one who is to believe.

3154260	3158740	Handy Smurf was like, he was basically Andy on WKRP.
3158740	3159900	That's how I remember him.
3160900	3161740	That's a deep cut.
3161740	3162980	Hefty is one for sure.
3164020	3164860	Hefty Smurf.
3164860	3165700	Hefty?
3165700	3166540	That doesn't sound right to me.
3166540	3168180	The only Smurf for you is one who is to blue.
3168180	3169220	That's Smurf is me.
3169220	3170140	My name is Hefty.
3170140	3170980	This is not a real...
3170980	3173540	When they're all writing songs to fuck...
3173540	3174380	They were all trying to follow up.
3174380	3177140	What fucking Israeli Smurf rip-off did you grow up on?
3177140	3181660	They were all trying to woo Smurfette in one episode.
3181740	3185740	And they all wrote songs or did things in that fucking...
3185740	3186580	I don't remember Hefty at all.
3186580	3189060	I will eat my fucking potato chip hat
3189060	3191220	if Hefty Smurf is not a real Smurf.
3191220	3194780	Well, I doubt you'd lie about it or get it wrong.
3194780	3195620	Hefty Smurf is a thing.
3195620	3196460	Hefty Smurf is a thing.
3196460	3198220	Is he a big, is he big and strong?
3198220	3199060	He's the Hefty Smurf.
3199060	3200540	He's good-looking.
3200540	3201380	He's the macho Smurf.
3201380	3203060	Unlike Vanity and...
3203060	3205820	Vanity had flowers and talked with an English accent.
3205820	3209220	And he always had a handheld mirror with them at all times.
3209220	3210540	I was like, I got...
3210540	3214420	Vanity was Ginger from Gilligan's Island.
3214420	3215940	But then you got Handy and Brainy.
3215940	3217500	It's like you split your professor.
3217500	3219860	Yeah, if he's so Handy, why'd he get the pencil?
3219860	3220740	Handy's part had the pencil behind the ears
3220740	3223860	and the slide roll and he knew how to make shit.
3223860	3224700	Out of mushrooms.
3224700	3226940	But Brainy knew how to not make shit?
3226940	3229500	I mean, would Brainy just stand over Handy's shoulder
3229500	3231300	and go like, you shouldn't do that?
3231300	3233900	And Brainy's like, this needs aerodynamics.
3233900	3235540	Because of air bubbles.
3235540	3237540	Oh shit, he fucking got it.
3237540	3238380	He got it.
3238420	3240340	Drop it, drop it.
3240340	3241180	What did he do?
3241180	3242020	That was the cat?
3242020	3244740	I asked, what was the name of Gargamel's cat?
3244740	3245580	And he got it.
3245580	3246540	Oh, Ezreal.
3246540	3247380	Ezreal.
3247380	3251660	OK, so the ColecoVision came with Smurf, the video game.
3251660	3252500	OK?
3252500	3256060	By the way, if you're a subscriber and you're under 50,
3256060	3257140	goodbye.
3257140	3260500	And I say that with no hate for you or us.
3260500	3261500	I'm happy.
3261500	3267900	And if you're not, type ColecoVision into Google Search
3267900	3269220	and whatever.
3269220	3272180	What was the game play on the Smurf game?
3272180	3273780	Let me tell you something.
3273780	3277540	Hardest fucking game ever.
3277540	3281100	I remember Christmas morning, we got the ColecoVision.
3281100	3283260	And we were shitting our pants because it
3283260	3286220	was like real arcade graphics in your home.
3286220	3289180	Coleco was like pharmaceutical cocaine.
3289180	3291620	Yeah, it was fucking amazing.
3291620	3292580	16 bits.
3292580	3294380	Ramstack had a Coleco.
3294380	3295580	It's good, right?
3295580	3296660	Nobody else had a Coleco.
3297260	3299100	We put in Smurf.
3299100	3300820	We put in Smurf.
3300820	3303380	Couldn't get past the first screen.
3303380	3304660	What was the game play?
3304660	3305380	Who are you?
3305380	3309580	You're a Smurf trying to get Smurf fat out of Gargamel's.
3309580	3310060	Crib.
3310060	3310980	Crib.
3310980	3312540	Scrolling game.
3312540	3316740	It starts out mushroom on one side of the frame,
3316740	3318300	a fence on the other.
3318300	3322100	And it would go, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
3322100	3323540	And you'd go boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
3323540	3326380	And you would have to jump over the fence.
3326420	3330820	And with those fucking weird ass ColecoVision joysticks,
3330820	3335500	which was like a knob collection on a phone pad,
3335500	3337620	which was like, what the hell?
3337620	3339460	What am I supposed to do with this?
3339460	3343860	You're supposed to jump and move at the same time, which
3343860	3346700	was almost impossible.
3346700	3349860	So we're trying to do this.
3349860	3355260	And we're trying to jump over the fence of the first screen.
3355260	3358580	And Jeff, Steven, me, we couldn't do it.
3358580	3359420	We couldn't do it.
3359420	3360580	Those are the Schwab brothers.
3360580	3363580	We're doing it for hours and hours and hours.
3363580	3364420	We could do it.
3364420	3366300	And all three of us are crying.
3366300	3369260	We're screen crying going, no, no, no, no, no.
3369260	3371460	And David and Donna Schwab, my parents are going,
3371460	3373980	it's just a really hard game.
3373980	3376820	You've got to practice it, but it's not even fun.
3376820	3381420	Or that quote that made me want to murder my whole family
3381420	3382540	and burn the house down.
3382540	3383540	If it makes you that angry.
3383540	3384740	Yeah, if it makes it.
3385540	3388860	The third time that you go, god damn it.
3388860	3391420	And you just hear from the kitchen,
3391420	3394740	if it makes you that angry, why do you keep playing it?
3397620	3398860	And I remember we didn't.
3398860	3400700	Mom, I want to talk to you about your marriage.
3402700	3403620	Well, that's the thing.
3403620	3404980	It's like, yeah, I guess you just.
3404980	3408100	A game you haven't passed the first level on.
3408100	3412140	Let's apply that to just real life instead of games.
3412140	3413500	I just wanted to take a dig that would
3413700	3414780	form a rift in my family.
3414780	3416260	Back in the days when there was a.
3416260	3417140	I'm kidding, Mom.
3417140	3419660	I think on the off chance my mom likes me enough now
3419660	3422060	to be watching this and that would.
3422060	3423460	Mom, I'm doing a joke.
3423460	3424580	What was the video game?
3424580	3426620	Dragon's Lair?
3426620	3427660	Dragon, right?
3427660	3428540	Dragon's Lair?
3428540	3429380	And what's that?
3429380	3430380	Space Ace and Dragon's Lair.
3430380	3432220	You can get Space Ace and Dragon's Lair.
3432220	3434380	It was $0.50 or $1 to play it.
3434380	3436980	And you couldn't get through fucking 15 seconds.
3436980	3439740	Because you're watching a cartoon, a Don Bluth cartoon,
3439740	3442300	and just having to memorize when to put the joke.
3442380	3447260	By the way, it was basically a DVD remote control.
3447260	3449900	And you were going chapter searching
3449900	3451900	with this fucking piece of shit.
3451900	3453140	The same thing with Donkey Kong.
3453140	3454980	Donkey Kong is a memorization game.
3454980	3456900	Yeah, it's all about memorizing it.
3456900	3459420	And jumping barrels.
3459420	3461300	Hell, yeah.
3461300	3464460	Do you guys remember when DVDs first came out?
3464460	3468460	It was the most important high five in podcast history.
3468460	3471460	The three year period during which the porn industry ever
3471460	3475340	forward, it's written on the porn industry's seal
3475340	3477700	in Latin, ever, ever forward.
3477700	3480140	Semper Paredes.
3480140	3484180	What's that French quote about audacity?
3484180	3486540	La das, la das, de jure, la das.
3486540	3488460	That's the French.
3488460	3491580	Always forward.
3491580	3495620	DVDs hadn't been in existence for a year
3495620	3497940	and wouldn't have been if it weren't for the porn industry.
3497940	3499660	And then also at the same time, the porn.
3499660	3501740	You would get a porn on DVD.
3501740	3506860	And the menu would always include a sex game.
3506860	3508020	And you'd be like, what?
3508020	3512220	And then it'd be like this fucking hallway,
3512220	3515740	like Wolfenstein graphic, and like this weird.
3515740	3518420	It's like it's just playing a video of a hallway.
3518420	3521620	And you're supposed to just use the tracks.
3521620	3525020	What do you think they came here for?
3525020	3527740	What do you think we came to Space Station 64?
3527740	3529140	We could go down a hallway.
3529860	3533820	And turn left and open a door, and there's a pussy.
3533820	3536100	And then you click on the pussy, and it's just a video.
3536100	3537380	You know what?
3537380	3541820	Jerking off wasn't fun until you guys added hallways.
3541820	3542860	But you can't blame them.
3542860	3546500	You can't blame porn for being a trying.
3546500	3551220	Porn is like the head of North Korea's, Kim Jong-un.
3551220	3552820	I can't remember which one we're on.
3552820	3556060	But it's like that thing of like you're a paranoid.
3556060	3557900	Porn is a paranoid dictator.
3558300	3560980	It knows that if it lets its guard down for a second,
3560980	3563260	it will be assassinated.
3563260	3565820	We will figure out a way to do away with porn
3565820	3568340	if porn doesn't stay relevant.
3568340	3571100	So it's always out there, just like nervous and sweaty.
3573820	3576020	Like a banana peel on Ron Jeremy's shoulder.
3579020	3581180	The guy in Casablanca, the actor who's sweaty,
3581180	3583780	and he's like, oh, we can't.
3583780	3584820	Bogart.
3584820	3587420	No, the other guy, the guy who sounds like Ren.
3588140	3589460	Peter Laurie.
3589460	3591140	Porn has the personality of Peter Laurie.
3591140	3594820	It's always, hey, Rick, Rick, don't you think that now
3594820	3595820	the DVDs are up?
3595820	3598580	Maybe, Rick, we should maybe make an interactive kind of porn,
3598580	3599540	huh, Rick, huh?
3599540	3602140	And the American viewer is just like, hey,
3602140	3603420	why don't you take it easy, huh?
3603420	3606980	See, sweetheart, I'll jerk off when I want to jerk off.
3606980	3610020	Yeah, but, Rick, that's not going to keep me alive, Rick.
3610020	3612940	Now do Ingrid Bergman.
3612940	3614340	I want you to be a porn version.
3614340	3616620	I want you to be a porn hub of all of these characters.
3616620	3618500	It's not a tumor.
3618500	3619660	That's not a tumor.
3619660	3621100	That's a good Ingrid Burma.
3621100	3623420	I don't know what Ingrid Bergman sounds like.
3623420	3627020	Do Sidney Green Street.
3627020	3628900	You must remember this.
3628900	3629700	Oh, racism.
3633100	3634740	He's not even in that movie.
3634740	3636340	Louis Armstrong?
3636340	3639820	I don't know if racism is the crime that's committed there.
3639820	3641100	If anything, lack of racism.
3641100	3645260	If I could confuse the piano Sam for Sidney Green Street,
3645260	3646180	I think I'm.
3646620	3647740	Post-racial.
3647740	3649940	Louis Armstrong was Sam in that movie.
3652540	3654300	Have you ever seen the movie?
3654300	3655100	It's a good movie.
3655100	3655980	Casablanca?
3655980	3657700	I don't think I've seen it.
3657700	3659900	Did you know there was an alternate ending to it,
3659900	3660940	that they changed the ending?
3660940	3662260	Zip.
3662260	3664420	They kind of riffed it at the end.
3664420	3669420	Do you want to riff another ending to Casablanca right now?
3670500	3675500	So, Victor Laszlo and Ingrid Bergman,
3675580	3677020	whatever her name is Elsa,
3677020	3679140	they get on the plane.
3679140	3682940	So you got Claude Raines and Humphrey Bogart.
3682940	3685780	And Humphrey Bogart and Claude Raines
3685780	3688300	are in a sticky situation because each of them
3688300	3691220	have been kind of traitors to their own laws.
3691220	3692540	Okay, so you beat Claude Raines.
3692540	3693380	Okay.
3696340	3699860	It seems, Rick, that we are in a bad situation.
3700820	3705340	You have to kill me or I have to arrest you.
3706460	3707300	You know.
3711660	3712660	What's his name?
3712660	3713780	What's his name?
3713780	3714740	Lieutenant.
3717020	3721740	You know, there comes a time in a man's life
3721740	3725100	when he needs to take-
3725100	3728580	Sorry, I have to take this call.
3728580	3729740	Telephone!
3731740	3734740	Thank you, Lieutenant Schwartz.
3734740	3735740	You're welcome.
3737940	3739820	He just stole my pen.
3739820	3740940	If you're both lieutenants,
3740940	3743220	how does he know to bring you the phone?
3744140	3746180	Well, then, that's why you have me, Rick.
3747300	3749700	Sorry, I didn't mean to pull calls.
3749700	3750700	Oh, sorry.
3750700	3751540	Telephone!
3751540	3753740	Oh, now I got a hand on the phone.
3754700	3758620	Maybe I'm a lieutenant, too, sweetheart.
3760100	3761340	Brrr!
3761340	3762820	Uh-oh.
3762820	3763660	Telephone?
3764860	3766020	That one's for you.
3767780	3768620	Hello.
3768620	3769460	Hello.
3769460	3770300	Hello.
3770300	3771140	Sweetheart.
3771140	3771980	Hello.
3771980	3772820	Hello.
3772820	3773660	Hello.
3773660	3774740	Is this America?
3776260	3778740	You've got an American, sweetheart,
3778740	3781540	but this is about as far away from America
3781540	3786540	as New Jersey is from Hoboken,
3787540	3789980	which isn't that far, see?
3789980	3794980	Hey, hey, hey, hey, what are you...
3796540	3800300	Yeah, what else are you doing over there?
3800300	3802780	Who's on your phone?
3802780	3803620	John.
3807820	3809020	Peter Laurie's still alive.
3809020	3811060	Oh, he didn't get killed in jail.
3811140	3813660	He got arrested by the Gestapo, but he's still alive.
3813660	3814820	Who was on your phone?
3814820	3818500	I was talking to the Vichy General
3818500	3820820	of the local police department.
3820820	3821660	Brrr!
3821660	3823100	Uh-oh.
3823100	3823940	Telephone.
3823940	3828940	Oh, shit, there's a second phone, sweetheart.
3828940	3832580	You want me to get rid of some of these dead soldiers here?
3832580	3835660	All those phones, I didn't answer, yeah.
3835660	3840060	Hello, and the other phone, sweetheart?
3840060	3841700	Hello.
3841700	3842620	Ingmar?
3842620	3843860	Rick, this is me.
3843860	3845460	Are you Eva?
3845460	3847900	No, if you don't remember my name, then I'll just hang up.
3847900	3849540	Oh, sweetheart?
3849540	3850700	You remember Paris, right?
3850700	3851940	Remember, you said we were...
3851940	3853940	We'll always have Paris, sweetheart.
3853940	3856060	But we'll always have Paris, but you forgot my name.
3856060	3858500	You know how to say my name, don't you, sweetheart?
3858500	3859980	Yes, your name is Rick, what's my name?
3859980	3861900	Just put your lips together and blow.
3861900	3864500	No, no, no, that's a different movie.
3864500	3865660	It's a different movie.
3865660	3868660	Hold on, can I put you, can I just put you on my shoulder?
3868980	3870580	Yes, my plane is taking off.
3870580	3872340	I got a third phone, sweetheart.
3872340	3873340	Hello.
3873340	3877580	Hey, could I please speak to Lano?
3877580	3878940	Panthro.
3878940	3879740	Is this Panthro?
3879740	3881700	No, this is Chitaro.
3881700	3882260	What?
3882260	3884060	Racist motherfucker.
3884060	3886620	Shh.
3886620	3889380	Hey, I didn't hang up.
3889380	3890780	Where's my Lano?
3893420	3894940	Who's that?
3894940	3895660	Hello?
3895660	3898140	I'm going to put you on hold, sweetheart.
3898220	3899540	Oh, I get it.
3899540	3901260	I get it.
3901260	3901980	Hello?
3901980	3902460	Hello?
3902460	3903860	Snurf, snurf, snurf.
3903860	3905660	Oh, it's Snurf, eh?
3905660	3908900	Let me put you on the phone with Chitaro by turning the phone.
3908900	3910460	Hey, where's Lano?
3910460	3912060	Snurf, snurf.
3912060	3913860	Oh, he's in the kitchen.
3913860	3915100	Snurf.
3915100	3916900	I'm going to go get him.
3916900	3918380	Can I get you anything?
3918380	3920180	I can't remember the name of the movie
3920180	3922260	where he says put your lips together and blow
3922260	3924660	with Lauren Bacall.
3924660	3926620	Oh, let me ask.
3926780	3928180	Key Largo.
3928180	3929380	No, it's not Key Largo.
3929380	3931860	That was with, what's his fucking name?
3931860	3932540	Big Sleep.
3932540	3933820	No, that's a big sleep.
3933820	3934820	Maltese.
3934820	3936700	Not the Maltese.
3936700	3940260	Dancer in the dark.
3940260	3944180	Hey, Lano, what was the name of the movie
3944180	3949260	where they say put your lips together and blow?
3949260	3951420	Lionel's not on your call, sweetheart.
3951420	3952740	He's in the kitchen.
3952740	3953620	Oh.
3953620	3954420	Oh.
3954420	3955580	Never mind.
3955820	3959340	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
3959340	3961580	What, what, Panthero?
3961580	3964940	I'm just in here making omelets.
3964940	3966820	I'm Chitara.
3966820	3969940	Chitara, I didn't recognize your voice.
3969940	3972140	Do you recognize these?
3972140	3976980	Oh, Sword of Omens, Lords of Light.
3979660	3982060	Those are incredible.
3982060	3985700	Excuse me, there's a, the cat phone is ringing.
3985700	3987740	To have and have not.
3987740	3988380	Click.
3988380	3990380	Ah.
3990380	3992380	I belong to a trivia club.
3992380	3993300	Who's that?
3993300	3996220	That was the trivia club telling me what movie.
3996220	3998780	Why are you talking to her all the time?
3998780	4002300	Chitara, you can't be jealous and sleep with Panthero.
4002300	4003380	You talked about this.
4003380	4006180	I'm going to show you a couple more zips.
4006180	4007180	My god, Chitara.
4007260	4010260	Chitara.
4010260	4011900	Your body is incredible.
4018700	4021180	Oh my god, you're not even a cat person.
4021180	4021940	It's Mumra.
4021940	4022820	It's Mumra.
4022820	4024300	Hey.
4024300	4027300	Mumra.
4027300	4031540	Well, if it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get.
4031540	4034660	Thunder, thunder, thunder.
4034660	4036940	Oh, shit, he stopped the thunder process.
4037260	4040060	No one ever thought to do that, god damn it.
4040060	4044020	Fuck, he stopped me before, before I could make my sword.
4044020	4045020	All the way.
4045020	4047620	God damn it, he put ice in my hands.
4049940	4051380	Don't you like it?
4051380	4053020	Don't you like it?
4053020	4053860	Don't you like it?
4053860	4055940	You liked it that one time.
4055940	4057220	Mumra.
4057220	4058900	Gross.
4058900	4061380	Why are we, why are we on this planet?
4061380	4066380	I don't know, I'm, I, I, I, I'm so, I'm so tired.
4066620	4067460	Yeah.
4067460	4068940	All, all the time.
4068940	4072740	Mumra, how come you have to be two people?
4072740	4075380	How come you have to change from a mummy man into a-
4075380	4077140	That's a good question, that's a good question.
4077140	4078060	You want to know?
4078060	4078900	Yeah.
4078900	4079740	You want to know?
4079740	4080580	Here.
4085020	4086420	Okay, you want to know?
4086420	4087260	You want to know?
4087260	4092260	Okay, so there's good energy
4092300	4094100	and then there's bad energy.
4094100	4095820	And then there's in between.
4095900	4097620	So when you're a mummy, you're good?
4098740	4103020	Well, good is defined by what we think is good
4103020	4104660	and what is bad, correct?
4104660	4106100	Well, I'm just a cat.
4106100	4109420	Well, yes, but you have an opinion of what is good, right?
4109420	4111740	I believe that the thunder energy
4111740	4115220	is the only good energy in the world, reverse.
4115220	4118500	And I, in 2018, do not.
4118500	4119820	What?
4119820	4120660	Mumra.
4120660	4121500	Right.
4121500	4126500	So I'm good when I'm old mummy guy, right?
4127940	4131980	But when I want to be bad and kick some ass,
4131980	4135340	I turn into a super mumra.
4135340	4138580	And that's when I take my sword of omens
4138580	4142620	and pray to the Lord of Light to give me sight beyond sight
4142620	4144940	and then say thunder several times
4144940	4147980	and assemble the thunder cats.
4147980	4150760	Why don't you just have the sword always long?
4151820	4153180	That's the real question.
4153180	4157340	Swords are for fighting and I believe in peace.
4160100	4161420	That's why.
4161420	4163780	My hope is that I'll never have to have sight
4163780	4166100	beyond sight ever again.
4166100	4170060	How long does it take you to grow the sword long?
4170060	4172020	Well, let me run through it in my head.
4172020	4176380	Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder cats.
4176380	4178740	Ho, about that long.
4178740	4181460	And then there's the light that goes out into space.
4182280	4183120	And then all of them come.
4183120	4183960	Turns it to the bat signal.
4183960	4185460	They come out, everybody runs to there.
4185460	4186300	Okay.
4186300	4189620	And the animation is done on the ones as they come.
4189620	4191500	A minute long of animation.
4191500	4192660	Yes, it's a solid.
4192660	4197660	And once a week I turn into strong mumra, another minute.
4199540	4203740	And then there's credits, which is two minutes.
4203740	4205100	Yes.
4205100	4208180	And then there's end credits, which is another full minute.
4208180	4209020	Yes.
4209020	4211180	So that's like five minutes.
4211220	4212420	We don't have to deal with it.
4212420	4213940	The rest is the shitty stuff.
4213940	4214780	Right.
4214780	4216540	Well, Snarf made some soup the other day
4216540	4219060	that Panthro thought was too spicy.
4219060	4220740	Right, right.
4220740	4221580	And that's all.
4221580	4223020	What do you mean, Panthro?
4223020	4225620	Snarf, let's be honest.
4225620	4227460	You're here for the three year olds.
4227460	4228660	I think it's a reach.
4228660	4231620	Well, we have to eat something.
4233460	4234980	The families have to eat their children
4234980	4236420	by leaving them in front of the television.
4236420	4240260	Well, you're getting pretty dark, Lionel.
4240260	4243660	Snarf makes me uncomfortable as mumra.
4243660	4244500	Why?
4244500	4245340	You know, and I'm a living dead.
4245340	4246180	Why?
4246180	4247020	You're a nice guy.
4247020	4248420	I'm just trying to make soup.
4248420	4251020	But you talk English.
4251020	4251900	Yes.
4251900	4253860	But you walk on all fours.
4253860	4254700	Well, sometimes.
4254700	4257700	You have like a personal relationship
4257700	4258580	with all these people.
4258580	4259420	Do you ever?
4259420	4260260	Lionel protected me.
4260260	4263340	Lionel protected me from this emotional abuse.
4263340	4266060	Snarf, this is a bed you made a long time ago.
4266060	4268220	You don't wear pants.
4268220	4269540	You can't drive a car.
4269540	4271580	What do you wear, mummy?
4271580	4272420	Bandages.
4272420	4273980	All right.
4273980	4278780	Because I'm one person all the time.
4278780	4279900	You walk on all fours.
4279900	4284100	You have to go into a second identity to prove who you are.
4284100	4285700	Does he shit in the bathroom?
4285700	4289060	Or does he just like shit in front of you like a dog?
4289060	4291620	I'll take a shit right in front of you.
4291620	4292460	No, no, no.
4292460	4293860	Snarf, stop.
4293860	4294660	What?
4294660	4296300	Lionel, should I not take a shit?
4296300	4297380	Don't take a shit.
4297380	4298460	Put some pants on.
4298460	4301220	Stand on your own two legs and learn how to drive.
4301220	4304180	He's basically cringer, but he never turns into Battlecat.
4304180	4305220	That's what his thing is.
4305220	4308820	Well, he says his name a lot, too, which is.
4308820	4309700	He's derivative.
4309700	4311020	He should be called derivative.
4311020	4311500	What?
4311500	4312620	Wait, Lionel, you're my friend.
4312620	4313540	But Snarf.
4313540	4314980	I thought you were my friend.
4314980	4317220	No, I'm your host, and you're a parasite.
4317220	4318140	Oh, fuck you.
4318140	4318980	Well, you don't fuck me.
4318980	4319780	Fuck me.
4319780	4320780	Fuck you.
4320780	4321300	Snarf!
4321300	4322100	Snarf!
4322100	4322580	Snarf!
4322580	4323060	Snarf!
4323060	4323860	Snarvy!
4323860	4325340	Oh!
4325340	4326140	Oh, fuck.
4326140	4326780	Oh, shit.
4326780	4327900	Now we can stand.
4328620	4330380	Now we can walk around.
4330380	4332860	Now we can have a relationship.
4332860	4335260	I'm normalized Snarf.
4335260	4335780	Oh.
4335780	4336780	Yeah.
4336780	4340380	Well, we just saved ourselves six minutes of animation.
4340380	4341900	Jesus Christ.
4341900	4343100	You seem like a normal guy.
4343100	4344060	Yeah, I was happy.
4344060	4344940	We're all normal.
4344940	4345780	I was happy.
4345780	4347780	Everybody's fine.
4347780	4350460	But stop being bullies.
4350460	4356140	I think if I taught anybody anything as Snarf,
4356140	4359540	it's don't bully anybody.
4359540	4361700	You guys live in a bully culture.
4361700	4364060	But if you have to teach us it by being high maintenance
4364060	4366340	and taking up that much real estate,
4366340	4367860	is the lesson even worth it?
4367860	4371220	Maybe it's a self-generated job guarding against bullying.
4371220	4375220	To be honest, I spent 30 seconds being non-Snarf,
4375220	4378980	being self-activated Snarf.
4378980	4380860	I want to go back to being regular flawed Snarf.
4380860	4383060	More comfortable, is it, to complain about everyone
4383060	4383740	bullying you?
4383740	4384700	Yeah.
4384700	4385780	That's not a bad idea.
4386420	4389060	It's like having a transformation sequence,
4389060	4391580	where he's not like this quadruped walking around,
4391580	4393140	probably humping shit.
4393140	4394380	He just turns into a guy.
4394380	4395980	He just stands around and he goes,
4395980	4398340	you need me to pick up these dishes here?
4398340	4399140	I can do it now.
4399140	4401340	Yeah, but I'm going to go back to being regular Snarf
4401340	4403220	because I find it more comfortable.
4403220	4404340	Nobody in He-Man.
4404340	4406820	I mean, forget about the fact that Prince Adam looked
4406820	4409420	exactly like He-Man.
4409420	4410100	I haven't.
4410100	4414540	He had a green cat, and then He-Man also had a green cat.
4414540	4415900	It was just rubbing people's faces.
4415900	4418940	Battle Cat didn't do shit, and Cringer had a personality.
4418940	4420300	Battle Cat just had a helmet on.
4420300	4424500	That wasn't the, I don't, sure.
4424500	4425620	Right?
4425620	4427740	It didn't make him less recognizable.
4427740	4429540	He-Man, He-Man.
4429540	4431620	I got to assume there's a Hardwick podcast that's
4431620	4433500	covered all of this.
4433500	4435300	Peter Lorre is back.
4435300	4437340	Hey, it's me, Rick.
4437340	4438460	It's me, Peter Lorre.
4438460	4440020	Hey, man.
4440020	4442220	Hey, man, huh?
4442220	4444740	Did you watch that thing on Netflix, the toys that
4444740	4445940	made us in the 80s?
4445940	4448060	They did this whole creation of He-Man,
4448060	4453140	and how the guy who created He-Man, the toy,
4453140	4455420	was just talking shit about the cartoon.
4455420	4458180	He goes, he's all buff.
4458180	4459580	Prince Adam's all buff.
4459580	4461940	He's all ripped, but he's a wimp?
4461940	4464780	That doesn't make any goddamn sense.
4464780	4466940	So what came first, the toy or the cartoon?
4466940	4468900	The toy.
4468900	4471500	Look, the people, I forgot who was it.
4472100	4472940	Was it Mattel?
4472940	4473940	I think.
4473940	4474940	What?
4474940	4475940	Was it?
4475940	4476940	Oh.
4476940	4481860	Well, Hasbro has He-Man now, but I think Mattel had He-Man,
4481860	4485500	but they had a chance to get Star Wars.
4485500	4487580	They went, nah, that movie's not going to go anywhere.
4487580	4488980	And then Kenner got it.
4488980	4491180	And then they went, shit.
4491180	4495420	And then G.I. Joe came around, and they went, fuck.
4495420	4499620	And then they said, well, why don't we create something?
4499620	4502660	Why don't we create a property before the movie?
4502660	4503980	And they created He-Man.
4503980	4508300	And He-Man is just like, they looked at G.I. Joe,
4508300	4509940	and they looked at Luke Skywalker.
4509940	4511300	And they go, look at these guys.
4511300	4512140	They're not posed.
4512140	4513740	They have blank expressions.
4513740	4514740	They're really small.
4514740	4517900	Let's make them really buff and give them expression,
4517900	4521660	and make them a bigger toy.
4521660	4523060	And then during the pitch meeting
4523060	4528500	when they were going to Toys R Us, they said, yeah, well,
4528500	4530220	how are kids going to know about this?
4530220	4533660	And they go, oh, well, they're going to watch the cartoon.
4533660	4535980	And they went, oh, OK, well, then we'll
4535980	4537100	buy a bunch of this stuff.
4537100	4537860	This sounds great.
4537860	4540140	And then they left the room, and said, well,
4540140	4541540	what do you mean, cartoon?
4541540	4543820	And they go, well, we'll have to make some phone calls.
4543820	4547620	All right, Shrom, if you could make a movie or a TV show,
4547620	4550900	and there was an action figure that kids played with,
4550900	4552500	what would the action figure be?
4552500	4554380	What, make up a new one?
4554380	4560020	If you created a show that is something like an idea
4560020	4561620	that you've already had, because you've
4561620	4563980	got lots of great ideas, or a new one,
4563980	4568220	but if you found out when you were an old man on your deathbed
4568220	4571020	and kids all loved their one action figure,
4571020	4573820	what would that action figure be?
4573820	4575940	Something that's already present?
4575940	4577300	Like something that you created?
4577300	4578300	Well, probably Skud.
4578300	4579100	I mean, like, Skud.
4579100	4579600	Oh, Skud.
4579600	4580100	Yeah.
4580100	4581060	That would be cool.
4581060	4584100	Yeah, well, Skud had an action figure,
4584140	4585460	but that was a disaster.
4585460	4587900	We hit peak toy with micronauts.
4587900	4592260	My brother had micronauts, and they were the best toy
4592260	4593460	ever.
4593460	4596420	They were all swallowable pieces.
4596420	4597260	That was the gimmick.
4597260	4599900	Everything was swallowable.
4599900	4602060	They had little fists that could come off
4602060	4603620	that were like pill size.
4603620	4604940	Everything was pill size.
4604940	4606100	Everything was removable.
4606100	4607100	Their heads were there.
4607100	4610180	Everything was just the size of a baby's epiglottis.
4610180	4611860	No bigger, no smaller.
4611860	4614220	What was the guy that talked fast?
4614220	4614740	Micro-machines.
4614740	4615540	That was micro-machines.
4615540	4617220	Micro-machines.
4617220	4619980	We got, did you have this micronauts toy?
4619980	4621140	This is a deep cut.
4621140	4623580	This is deeper than, this is like.
4623580	4625140	My brother might have had it.
4625140	4629500	It was a giant hornet with like purple transparent wings.
4629500	4630580	It was a spaceship.
4630580	4633940	I think, and then you could hold all your micronauts in it?
4633940	4637740	I don't know if it was like Wasp-tron or something
4637740	4639740	like that or whatever, but it had like this,
4639780	4643380	it was all black, had like a pointed face
4643380	4644740	with like red windows.
4644740	4645580	You could open it up.
4645580	4646420	That was the cockpit.
4646420	4647540	You could put your micronaut in it
4647540	4651980	and then had like these laser purple wings
4651980	4653900	that you could make flap or whatever.
4653900	4655780	And it was like the coolest thing ever.
4655780	4659700	And Jeff Schraub got that for Christmas
4659700	4661780	because he always got the cool shit.
4661780	4666780	And I got clothes, the vegetable soup of gifts.
4667300	4671780	Yeah, but those clothes today.
4672780	4673620	Look at me.
4673620	4674700	Yeah.
4674700	4675940	Yeah, micronauts were cut
4675940	4678460	because they were just so, they were tiny
4678460	4682420	and but every fucking joint was articulated.
4682420	4683340	They were metal too.
4683340	4685100	They had like, their heads were like metal.
4685100	4685940	Yeah.
4685940	4687340	Spencer, what was your favorite toy growing up?
4687340	4691260	Like the one toy that you could rely on?
4691260	4692100	I don't know.
4692100	4693020	When you're talking about micronauts
4693020	4695300	that remind me of the Z-Bots, which seem kind of similar.
4695300	4699020	They're like a collectible figure that's pretty small.
4699020	4700220	But yeah, I don't know.
4700220	4701180	I like connects.
4701180	4704180	For me, it was Legos and Star Wars action figures.
4706020	4707700	Legos is the best.
4707700	4708700	And then you get it.
4708700	4710380	You have to go pee in the middle of the night
4710380	4715060	and you step in a Lego and you just die because it hurts.
4715060	4717380	Steven got a fucking at-at walker.
4717380	4718820	What?
4718820	4721580	And I got a fucking sweater.
4723020	4724580	I feel like that's because probably.
4724820	4726860	What the fuck is this?
4726860	4728860	I told you the Ken doll story, right?
4728860	4730140	I told you that.
4730140	4730980	No, tell us again.
4730980	4731820	Tell it again.
4732820	4737820	I would play Barbies with the girls next door a lot.
4739580	4740540	And you would win.
4742100	4744460	I would win when they would leave the room
4744460	4747820	and I would pull my dick out and rub them all over the Barbies.
4747820	4748820	Wait, wait, wait.
4748820	4751940	How jokey is that joke?
4751940	4753300	How jokey?
4753380	4754540	It's not a joke.
4754540	4756380	You would rub your dick on the Barbies?
4756380	4758020	And I would kiss them and.
4758020	4759420	And you rub your dick on them?
4759420	4760260	Yeah.
4760260	4761100	On the Barbies?
4761100	4761940	Yeah.
4761940	4762780	Okay.
4762780	4763620	I was 21.
4763620	4766100	No, no, no, no, no, no.
4766100	4771100	No, I just, I was so in love with Barbies.
4771420	4775300	Like I just, I would just kiss them and rub them on my face
4775300	4777380	and everywhere and take off their clothes
4777380	4778620	and it was just so fascinating.
4778620	4780180	Well, you didn't have sisters either.
4780180	4782620	I had a sister, but she was institutionalized.
4782940	4783780	Barbies.
4783780	4787420	And so like, there's part of deprivation.
4787420	4789500	Like if you're not raised around a sister,
4789500	4793740	the, you're encountering femininity for the first time
4793740	4797700	through girls' toys.
4797700	4798540	Rainbow bright.
4798540	4799380	Right.
4799380	4800940	Like you go to the girl across the street
4800940	4802860	or it's like you're meeting,
4802860	4804300	you're getting play dates or whatever.
4804300	4806740	It's like, this girl's got these girl toys
4806740	4809300	and the girl toys are like, they're like girls.
4809300	4810140	They're doing something today.
4810140	4813700	They're wearing skirts and like, you're, you're, you know,
4813700	4815580	you're, you're, you're maybe seven years old,
4815580	4818420	but you're, you're, you're still a little barbarian.
4818420	4819260	Yeah.
4819260	4821900	I was, I was, I was snarf humping on these toys.
4821900	4826900	And I guess I played with Barbies enough
4827580	4831620	that my parents told my grandma,
4831620	4836620	well, what does, what does, what does Steven, Robbie,
4837340	4839900	what does Jeffrey, Rob, Robbie,
4839940	4842220	what does Robbie want for Christmas?
4842220	4845100	And did they, they told them the Barbie story.
4845100	4847860	And so they don't give them a Barbie because,
4847860	4850620	and they gave me, because then they don't want a gay son.
4850620	4853220	So they gave me a Ken doll.
4853220	4854060	So I opened it up.
4854060	4858340	Steven gets like fucking Ewoks and mum ros and shit.
4858340	4859940	And I'm like sitting there and I open it up
4859940	4863940	and I get a Ken doll and I looked at it
4863940	4867540	and it, all this went like flash through my head.
4867540	4870420	And I was like, oh my God, they think I'm gay.
4870420	4872380	And this is a way to stop it.
4872380	4874220	And it's totally ineffective.
4874220	4876660	This is making me way gayer.
4876660	4878460	And then I start full on.
4878460	4880180	They put the pedal to the metal.
4880180	4881700	This guy's a beefcake.
4881700	4882540	Yes.
4882540	4886500	And then I pull on snot, snot cry, cry.
4886500	4889660	And I'm going, grandma, I didn't want this.
4889660	4891300	I didn't want this.
4891300	4896300	Stomping my foot way too old to be that like fucking.
4897020	4897860	Part of it is.
4897860	4899780	Cartman level crying.
4899780	4901260	Part of it is it's a disappointing gift,
4901260	4904540	but most of it is the humiliation.
4904540	4906260	It was me screaming to the world,
4906260	4907500	no, you don't understand.
4907500	4908860	I wanted to tell him.
4908860	4909700	No.
4909700	4910540	I'm straight as an arrow.
4910540	4912860	That's why I love those Barbie dolls.
4912860	4915300	I'm too straight.
4915300	4918020	I'm dangerously straight.
4918020	4918900	Yes.
4918900	4921340	I put my dick on a Barbie.
4921340	4923180	I like the idea that your parents thought.
4923180	4926300	Dad beat the shit out of me.
4926300	4928540	Like, that was the worst thing.
4928540	4930700	Like he beat me to death.
4930700	4933740	And then stuck my face in the corner
4933740	4936460	and made me stay there forever.
4936460	4941540	Because I was like, no, I don't want this.
4941540	4942860	I don't want it.
4942860	4945060	You got the wrong idea.
4945060	4947420	I was molesting those dolls.
4947420	4950620	If you had opened up the kendall and go, ooh, hooray.
4950620	4951900	He would like that too.
4951900	4952420	I don't know.
4952620	4954660	That's the part that I'm fascinated by,
4954660	4956020	is that they were sort of like, I
4956020	4958980	like the nuance with which this Midwestern family is going,
4958980	4961420	like, well, he spends an awful lot of time
4961420	4963420	with those girl toys.
4963420	4965940	Isn't there a masculine aspect to them
4965940	4970820	that we could use to bring them back into the roller derby?
4970820	4972780	Oh my god, I was like so upset.
4972780	4976700	I walked into my son rubbing his dick on a female doll.
4976700	4978860	Let's give him a male doll to rub his dick on.
4978860	4982340	That's not the, they didn't know he was rubbing his dick
4983220	4987700	They thought he was interested in playing with the female dolls.
4987700	4992260	They didn't know he was properly objectifying women at an early age.
4992260	4995380	And that there was nothing to worry about.
4995380	4997660	Meanwhile, Steve is getting the Death Star.
4997660	4999140	What the fuck is the adad?
4999140	5000740	Fucking everything.
5000740	5002420	You can fly out the bottom of the adad.
5002420	5003420	But isn't part of this, Rob?
5003420	5005580	Because I grew up with, I've died an older brother
5005580	5008620	and like a big tradition in the Midwest.
5008620	5013700	And our generation was, the Christmas would come, you know,
5013700	5017260	and they'd just take the Sears catalog and plop it in front of you.
5017260	5021220	Oh, they stopped doing that after you discovered the bra section.
5021220	5023100	Right.
5023100	5025460	I mean, like, they were the Toys R Us catalog.
5025460	5030140	It would be like, oh, Santa wants to know what you want.
5030140	5033420	And then you'd have to go through the book.
5033420	5035740	And there's all these kick ass toys.
5035740	5039500	But you pointed them and go, I want that.
5039500	5043980	And their parents would go, no, Santa can't afford that, you fucking idiot.
5043980	5048180	And then you'd settle on a thing that was like, I assume,
5048180	5053020	around $30 in Carter era, where it's like whatever Optimus Prime
5053020	5055380	was worth in 1980.
5055380	5056500	I didn't get that.
5056500	5057940	I didn't get Optimus Prime.
5057940	5061220	But I'm just saying, like, that process, though, I'm saying I would end up.
5061220	5062300	Got a fucking Ken doll.
5062300	5066580	And it was one where you could put like you can give them
5066580	5069620	you can give them a sideburn or whatever.
5069620	5071300	And he's got a suit and tie.
5071300	5074820	And maybe you could dress up and comb your hair every once in a while, Robbie.
5074820	5078940	And it's like, Stephen's like in the 20th century,
5078940	5082500	and Jeff is building stuff out of Apollo Lego.
5082500	5087460	And I just get the clothes and the fucking shit.
5087460	5089300	Yeah.
5089300	5090420	Well, it's good.
5090420	5091340	This is good.
5091340	5091820	I like this.
5091820	5095220	Yeah, everything bad happening to you is actually good.
5095220	5096620	Why?
5096620	5097980	Because Dan says so.
5097980	5098480	Oh, OK.
5098480	5101060	No, I'm saying it's good to see he's alive.
5101060	5105940	He's got to, he's, you know, your fear of being angry,
5105940	5111180	your fear of being just a barbaric, you know, they might be part of it.
5111180	5112500	Like, we want to be good guys.
5112500	5117900	We want to be gentle and evolved and smurf is a hard game.
5117900	5119900	I just was watching a YouTube video of it.
5119900	5123220	And man, you know what's after that first screen?
5123220	5125380	A second screen with the second fence.
5125380	5126780	It's like the same exact place.
5126780	5128260	It's a little higher.
5128260	5129620	No, it's not even.
5129620	5132540	And then it's two screens of nothing and then
5132540	5134700	a screen where you have to jump over a little crab
5134700	5136900	grass in the exact same spot as those fences.
5136900	5137900	Do you have the video?
5137900	5142580	Do you have the videos that play the song that you would hear over and over
5142580	5145180	and over again until you went crazy?
5145180	5147020	Scream crying, scream.
5147020	5149420	I did a lot of scream crying when I was a kid.
5149420	5150660	No wonder.
5150660	5153300	At least you had a Coleco, you know?
5153300	5158380	Well, we had a Coleco Adam.
5158380	5162260	My family had an Odyssey, because that's how you roll when your dad's a baker.
5165140	5166140	Fucking bakers.
5172980	5173980	I thought someone was beatboxing.
5179620	5181100	See, hear that?
5181100	5182340	That's hitting the fence.
5182340	5184620	Yeah, you hit the fence and then it just all stops.
5184620	5187020	And then all happiness stops.
5187020	5188140	And then you do that three times.
5188140	5189180	What was the first?
5189180	5189980	What was the first?
5189980	5190500	Idiot.
5190500	5193100	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5193100	5193620	Oh, yeah.
5193620	5195620	That's the same theme.
5195620	5201260	We are the Smurfs, and we were made with no joy.
5201260	5205060	The only Smurf for you is one who is true blue.
5205060	5206980	That Smurf is me.
5206980	5208260	My name is happy.
5208300	5210300	Gargamel wanted to eat the Smurfs.
5210300	5212540	No, he wanted to turn them into gold.
5212540	5214180	Oh.
5214180	5214820	Smurfs.
5214820	5216300	How is he going to do that?
5216300	5217660	Smurfs are melting them down.
5217660	5219540	How many apples high was a Smurf?
5219540	5220140	Three.
5220140	5221140	OK.
5221140	5224980	All right, let's play some fucking D and motherfucking D.
5224980	5226060	Which is actually terrifying.
5226060	5228380	Something three apples high is terrifying to me.
5228380	5229220	That's too high.
5229220	5230220	Like, they're bigger.
5230220	5231780	They don't look that big.
5231780	5234380	Yeah, how big are them motherfucker mushrooms?
5234380	5238020	They got windows and shit in there and a chimney, motherfucker.
5238660	5240900	Three apples high, and they go through that door.
5240900	5243460	That means the mushrooms up to my hip.
5243460	5243940	All right.
5243940	5245700	At least.
5245700	5251300	Let's save that for our other podcast called Smurf Grief.
5251300	5255820	Urban cartoon architect, I love you.
5255820	5258700	Three apples high, how big are your apples?
5258700	5260860	Rob, were you here last week?
5260860	5261340	No.
5261340	5262260	Were you hip to the jive?
5262260	5262780	No.
5262780	5264260	Do you want to play, Rob?
5264260	5265420	I know you hate games.
5265420	5267220	We're pretty sure he's excited.
5267220	5268140	No, I don't.
5268140	5268740	I don't.
5268740	5272340	You're about to waylay a guy that's currently pooping, right?
5272340	5272820	Right.
5272820	5275620	I feel like every time I play, I do it wrong.
5275620	5277020	It's fine.
5277020	5279260	You'll probably be OK.
5279260	5281500	Break it down.
5281500	5285740	Last time on Harmon Time.
5285740	5291380	Our heroes were in Dornester on the quest for Patchen's Gem.
5291380	5293860	After some initial fact finding, they
5293860	5296180	discovered enough to realize that they
5296180	5300140	should head to the theater and find some clues.
5300140	5302940	There they met a guy named Gretel, who was fat,
5302940	5304700	and asked him some questions.
5304700	5308700	And he pointed them all into the direction of Shrove,
5308700	5310900	a figure about town.
5310900	5313700	And so on the pursuit for Shrove,
5313700	5317260	our heroes left and went to the tavern,
5317260	5319660	but not before discussing what they thought
5319660	5323980	was the situation at hand, which I wish I could quote directly,
5323980	5325740	but I cannot.
5325740	5329660	Then they went to the tavern, where they met Cool Dennis,
5329660	5333500	and learned some information, where they met this dude,
5333500	5334500	and he had a cloak.
5334500	5336340	And it turned out it was Patchen's cloak
5336340	5338620	from when he got robbed that first time,
5338620	5341540	when it set off the quest of Patchen's Gem in the first
5341540	5342420	place.
5342420	5344620	And the guy who was wearing that cloak,
5344620	5347420	he said the guy who gave him the cloak was Shrove,
5347420	5349860	and he was in the bathroom, or something like that.
5349860	5352940	And then the gang set up in the bathroom,
5352940	5355180	making sure to send diarrhea to the window
5355180	5357140	to guard for an escape.
5357140	5359620	Surrounding Shrove in the bathroom,
5359620	5362420	our heroes were about to leap into action
5362420	5367260	to hopefully get to the bottom of the quest for Patchen's Gem.
5367260	5368140	But will they?
5372580	5374460	So I'm standing by the window.
5374460	5377700	You're outside this tavern, because there's
5377700	5382140	a guy in the bathroom of the tavern that's like our perp.
5382140	5382660	Right.
5383260	5384700	I'm playing it cool.
5384700	5387420	I sent you out in case there's a window to the bathroom,
5387420	5388820	because I don't want this guy leaving.
5388820	5389780	I'm playing it cool.
5389780	5390780	You're playing it cool.
5390780	5391980	You're outside the window.
5391980	5395580	I'm ready to cast Flair to dazzle him when he comes out,
5395580	5397980	so that you can waylay him, Carlos.
5397980	5400100	Do I see Jeff?
5400100	5400980	No, you're outside.
5400980	5402900	No, because you're outside.
5402900	5406180	Carlos and I are around the bathroom door.
5406180	5407740	You're outside around the window, right?
5407740	5409820	It's kind of like the drawing room, or wherever.
5409820	5412500	So like the back of the bathroom.
5412500	5413620	So I'm just hanging out.
5413620	5414780	I'm just playing it cool.
5414780	5417780	Yeah, you're just trying to see if anyone climbs out.
5417780	5419460	Yeah, you're playing it cool.
5419460	5420300	I'm playing it cool.
5420300	5421660	I'd say you're playing it cool.
5421660	5423140	The window of the bathroom.
5423140	5425460	So Carlos, let's make sure we got our shit together.
5425460	5427900	When Shrove comes out of here from poop,
5427900	5431020	and we know that this guy is involved
5431020	5437660	with the waylaying of Patchen's, he probably has the gem.
5437660	5440180	I'm ready to cast Flair to dazzle him.
5440180	5443220	Or should we figure this out?
5443220	5444660	What's the best way to do about this?
5444660	5447380	Yeah, we need to plan post-apprehension,
5447380	5449820	because we're not taking him to the Church of Silver Flame.
5449820	5451260	No, we're taking him down.
5451260	5453860	We're taking him to 21 Fuck You Street.
5453860	5456540	Well, we're taking him God knows where, but we
5456540	5460740	got to not cause a civic incident.
5460740	5463620	People see us mugging this guy.
5463620	5467140	All right, so maybe we just knock him unconscious.
5467140	5472020	I can do chalalie and cudgel this guy and knock him out.
5472020	5474900	And then you're stronger than me.
5474900	5475900	You're bigger than me.
5475900	5478060	We can just take him.
5478060	5479780	Yeah, I just don't know where to take him.
5479780	5486420	But we get him outside.
5486420	5487380	Is it nighttime?
5487380	5488260	Hey, cool, Dennis.
5488260	5489380	It's getting towards evening.
5489380	5489880	Yeah.
5489880	5492020	Do you have rooms to rent here?
5492020	5494420	No, this is just kind of like a tavern.
5494420	5497140	It's not a tavern slash inn or whatever.
5497140	5498980	We don't get too many visitors, so.
5498980	5501700	What's your policy on people knocking out people
5501700	5503420	as they come out of a bathroom and dragging them out
5503420	5504140	of the tavern?
5504140	5508180	I'd say it's directly against both the rules of this tavern
5508180	5510140	and the rules of House Galanda, which
5510140	5513340	governs all sorts of places of hospitality in the nation.
5513340	5515020	Oh, shit, that's bad for us.
5515020	5517820	Is there any way to get a temporary permit
5517820	5519740	if our interest is in not disrupting
5519740	5521980	your House of Hospitality if I could give you
5521980	5525660	some gold pieces just as a reprieve,
5525660	5528340	because our goal is to just make this as painless as possible.
5528340	5529380	I just want to get him out of here
5529380	5530540	and take him somewhere else.
5530540	5533140	He looks at you with a look, and he says,
5533140	5536540	Sonny, I don't think you know the situation you are in.
5536540	5539460	Do you know who Shrove is, what he is to this town?
5539460	5541900	Do you know who you are to this town?
5541900	5543100	Well, I am a stranger.
5543100	5544100	Right.
5544100	5545100	Isn't Shrove the master?
5545100	5546100	Shrove's a good friend.
5546100	5548460	He's the master of the theater guild, right?
5548780	5552660	Yeah, Gretel told you he was the theater master, I think.
5552660	5555900	Well, do you know what the church is to this town?
5555900	5557300	A pain in my rump.
5557300	5559540	Yeah, well, it can only get bigger.
5559540	5562780	I mean, Shrove's got himself into a real hot mess.
5562780	5564300	I don't want any trouble.
5564300	5566300	I don't want to win a popularity contest either.
5566300	5568540	I walk up to Carlos and go Carlos with a wink, like,
5568540	5569500	hey, you know what?
5569500	5572380	Let's just leave it.
5572380	5573260	OK, cool.
5573260	5575420	I guess we won't pay you anything,
5575420	5576540	and we won't do anything.
5576540	5581260	Message received, but we still go back to the bathroom.
5581260	5583420	I'm fucking going to get this motherfucker.
5583420	5585860	And if things get tough, I'll just summon a giant ant
5585860	5586860	in the middle of your bar.
5586860	5587380	Exactly.
5587380	5591020	Well, shushy, shushy, shushy pie.
5591020	5591580	Yeah.
5591580	5592700	So you guys are just.
5592700	5594580	You want that?
5594580	5596420	You're outside.
5596420	5598980	You guys are just retaking your positions
5598980	5601460	that you were in formerly when it was clear that you were going
5601460	5602860	to ambush the bathroom.
5602860	5604940	After having said you are going to do that?
5604940	5607700	I'm going to hold my crotch like pee-pee dance,
5607700	5609340	and go, oh, you know what?
5609340	5612060	All this talk about things that made me want to go pee-pee
5612060	5614980	dance, so I'm going to go stand in line for the restaurant.
5614980	5616060	All right, great.
5616060	5617340	That makes sense.
5617340	5619260	And I'll tell you what I'm going to fucking do.
5619260	5622060	I'll be ready with Shilley so I can cudgel
5622060	5623460	this motherfucker and my quarterstaff
5623460	5628060	because a plus one weapon with 2D6 damage.
5628060	5628700	Damn.
5628700	5629580	Yeah.
5629580	5637420	So I'm fake pee-pee dancing out in front of the men's room.
5637420	5638140	I'm into it.
5638140	5639180	OK.
5639180	5641100	I'm into it.
5641100	5642620	Hey, what are we going to do, man?
5642620	5644180	We're in over our heads.
5644180	5644900	We did it again.
5644900	5645580	We're in over our heads.
5645580	5646660	We're in over our heads.
5646660	5647180	Nothing.
5647180	5648140	You're outside.
5648140	5649500	You can't hear me.
5649500	5650460	I'm talking to myself.
5650460	5651940	I'm right next to you.
5651940	5653540	I'm ready to fucking rock.
5653540	5654700	This guy's got to come out.
5654700	5655860	He's just been pooping.
5655860	5657460	We're going to fucking get this motherfucker.
5657460	5658260	I'm outside.
5658260	5660300	Maybe we should just follow him.
5660300	5661980	Yeah.
5661980	5662580	No.
5662580	5663460	I'm going to go in.
5663460	5663940	What?
5663940	5664540	Follow him?
5664540	5665820	He's going to sneak out.
5665820	5668340	We're going to lose him like we always do.
5668340	5670220	I start tapping on the window.
5670220	5673540	We spent the last 45 minutes waiting for this guy
5673540	5675620	to get off the goddamn pot.
5675620	5677540	And I'll tell you what I'm not going to do.
5677540	5678860	Oh.
5678860	5679940	He's knocking on the window.
5679940	5680820	Hey.
5680820	5682260	Oh, shit.
5682260	5684260	Hey, come on.
5684260	5685460	We're not aware of that.
5685460	5686900	That's true.
5686900	5689180	Let's see.
5689180	5690340	Yeah, you're not aware of that.
5690340	5690900	OK.
5690900	5692860	Poop awareness.
5692860	5694060	Hey.
5694060	5695140	Shrove.
5695140	5696660	Shrove.
5696660	5697900	Yeah, no.
5697900	5698580	You're doing that.
5698580	5699900	Yeah, you're doing that.
5699900	5701140	It's alarming.
5701140	5702220	Hey.
5702220	5704900	No one's responding, though.
5704900	5705540	All right.
5705540	5706060	We wait.
5706060	5707500	How long have we been waiting?
5707500	5708860	And how long is this poop?
5708860	5710700	Let's say you've been waiting about five minutes.
5710700	5711180	OK.
5711180	5711780	It's a standard poop.
5711780	5713220	I'm going to wait this motherfucker up.
5713220	5713860	It's, yeah.
5713860	5716660	My shit lately isn't fucking.
5716660	5718380	It's ready to go.
5718380	5718940	All right.
5718940	5720540	So I was knocking pretty hard.
5720540	5721540	Oh, yeah.
5721540	5725380	Did you add that into the role?
5725380	5726300	Yeah.
5726300	5729620	And you're one of the strongest people here, I think.
5729620	5731340	Yeah.
5731340	5733340	And that didn't do anything.
5733340	5735740	Well, it made noise, but he didn't respond.
5735740	5736580	I think he's dead.
5736580	5738500	Maybe he was scared.
5738500	5740020	I'm going to open the window.
5740020	5740580	OK.
5740580	5741300	OK.
5741300	5746420	I take my Elvish blade, and then I
5746420	5751660	stick just the tip underneath the crack of the window.
5751660	5758020	And I use it as like a lever to do.
5758020	5758860	Well, how would you do it?
5758860	5759620	No, this is right.
5759620	5761140	I'm not laughing at your methodology.
5761140	5761660	OK.
5761660	5762140	OK.
5762140	5764900	And then I start prying it.
5764900	5767140	And it'll probably take a couple of,
5767140	5770180	because you know when you do the butter knife thing,
5770180	5771660	it doesn't get under there right away.
5771660	5772940	But I get it, you know.
5772940	5773900	You get there.
5773900	5774420	Yeah.
5774420	5777220	I kind of go back and forth a little bit.
5777220	5778100	Yeah.
5778100	5779300	To get it underneath.
5779300	5779780	OK.
5779780	5784420	And then I, are you rolling the dice?
5784420	5785820	Well, you're not done yet.
5785820	5786500	What are you doing?
5786500	5787980	Just see what you are going to do.
5787980	5788700	You open the window.
5788700	5789380	Yeah, it opens.
5789380	5790300	I open the window.
5790300	5790780	Right.
5790780	5791620	I open the window.
5791620	5792980	So no dice?
5792980	5793900	No.
5793900	5794700	OK, open the window.
5794700	5796140	I go, hey, hey.
5796140	5797860	You can see, you can see Shrove.
5797860	5800700	He's standing up like kind of in a corner,
5800700	5802100	not near the toilet or anything.
5802100	5803940	He's just staring at you.
5803940	5806500	Like he's been seeing you knocking on the window
5806500	5809860	and then slowly working it open.
5809860	5810460	Right.
5810460	5811700	So he's just staring at you.
5811700	5817220	He's like an older black guy wearing like kind of glasses.
5817220	5819980	And he's got these big, thick, long dreads.
5819980	5823140	And he wears like the clothes of a scholar.
5823140	5828740	And yeah, he looks like he's seen crazier shit than this.
5828740	5832260	But at the same time, he's like, what?
5832260	5834540	Why would anyone want to see what's in a bathroom?
5834540	5835900	That's kind of the look he's got.
5835900	5836380	OK.
5839140	5839980	All right.
5839980	5841260	So you're looking at him.
5841260	5842060	He's looking at you.
5842060	5844620	OK, I'm going to just, I stare back at him.
5848340	5851020	For how long?
5851020	5852020	Until he does something?
5852020	5852900	Until he does something.
5852980	5855500	All right, well, then after about 20 seconds of this,
5855500	5858140	he starts slowly inching to the door.
5858140	5859380	OK.
5859380	5865260	And I'm going to lock eyes with him and follow him.
5865260	5866340	Like my sight.
5866340	5867020	With your eyes.
5867020	5867620	With my eyes.
5867620	5868340	OK.
5868340	5869180	Yeah, yeah.
5869180	5870940	He slowly makes his way towards the door.
5870940	5873700	And I'm not making him do this with my mind, right?
5873700	5876980	No, you're definitely not making him do this with your mind.
5876980	5877500	OK, good.
5877500	5877980	All right.
5877980	5878420	Yeah.
5878420	5879340	OK.
5879340	5879860	I mean, yeah.
5879860	5882140	It's intimidating.
5882260	5884020	It's intimidating, yeah.
5884020	5888300	He gropes through the door knob, and he opens it.
5888300	5892060	And I cast Flair to dazzle him.
5892060	5894140	All right.
5894140	5896140	I'm going to dazzle the fuck out of this guy.
5896140	5899300	What's your wisdom score?
5899300	5901860	What's your wisdom score?
5901860	5904420	My wisdom is, sorry.
5907220	5909340	Where's wisdom?
5909340	5910180	It doesn't matter.
5910180	5912020	He didn't roll high enough, sorry.
5912380	5913660	He gets dazzled?
5913660	5914900	You said Flair, right?
5914900	5917220	I'm 19 wisdom.
5917220	5917820	Great.
5917820	5918860	16 plus 3.
5918860	5919900	Does that affect just him?
5922940	5923660	The dazzle?
5923660	5924140	Yeah.
5924140	5924740	Yeah.
5924740	5925900	Would I get dazzled too?
5925900	5929620	I mean, I'm looking inside the bathroom.
5929620	5931060	Well, then, yeah.
5931060	5932740	So I didn't dazzle him.
5932740	5934500	No, you dazzled him.
5934500	5936260	How dazzled is he?
5936260	5937420	Completely.
5938420	5942620	I want to push, then, into the bathroom
5942620	5945140	with the dazzled Shrove.
5945140	5945940	Try to do it.
5945940	5948260	I'm trying not to make it a big deal.
5948260	5949380	It is.
5949380	5951460	Casting magic's a big deal.
5951460	5952540	It's obvious.
5952540	5955060	It's like a big magical display.
5955060	5958020	I'm going to push my way into the bathroom of Shrove.
5958020	5959460	All right, you do that.
5959460	5962660	You notice, I mean, everything happens so fast, so to speak,
5962660	5964060	or whatever.
5964060	5967660	But you do notice that when these events start unfolding,
5967660	5970340	literally everyone in the tavern leaps to their feet
5970340	5971580	and starts moving towards you.
5971580	5973180	But you're in the bathroom now.
5973180	5976020	Well, Jeff, are you going into the bathroom too?
5976020	5979060	I'm standing in the bathroom doorway dazzling.
5979060	5981900	Right, but then Dan shoved everyone into the bathroom.
5981900	5987740	OK, I stay in the corridor leading in there,
5987740	5989660	and I pull out my chilele ready for action.
5989660	5991340	All right, you can't do that because you've
5991340	5992900	got to cast it as a spell first.
5992940	5996820	OK, well, should I just go in the bathroom?
5996820	5998580	You could do so many things, man.
5998580	6001780	Wait, but I can't do chilele because I've already
6001780	6002420	got a spell going.
6002420	6005260	Well, chilele is a spell, so you have to cast that before,
6005260	6007140	and you don't have enough actions currently
6007140	6009740	to cast two spells in a turn.
6009740	6011500	But he could get into the bathroom with us.
6011500	6012020	Yeah.
6012020	6015380	Yeah, let's go in the bathroom and start to surf this out.
6015380	6017140	If it's possible to do that, let's do it.
6017140	6019940	Is the window big enough for me to crawl inside?
6019980	6024140	Yeah, an alternative pitch to that, which would be OK.
6024140	6027580	Well, I think maybe this shouldn't be our destination.
6027580	6031740	I was thinking maybe we go out the window.
6031740	6038340	OK, so Spencer, look at me because this is a visual thing.
6038340	6038860	OK.
6038860	6042060	So I'm going to do this.
6042060	6044300	He's given a boost.
6044300	6046420	Yeah, but just for them to come down.
6046420	6048060	Finger cradle boost.
6048060	6049420	But first things first.
6049500	6050540	Come outside the window.
6050540	6053860	We got this guy right now more than we're ever going to have him.
6053860	6055020	I want the fucking gem.
6055020	6055900	He's dazzled.
6055900	6056700	Yeah, exactly.
6056700	6057340	Dazzled.
6057340	6060280	So hand him towards me.
6060280	6064180	I say, Shrove, can you hear me?
6064180	6065180	Yeah, for sure.
6065180	6072460	We want Patchen's gem, which you may know as just the gem.
6072460	6073740	It's not yours.
6073740	6074540	Where is it?
6074540	6080100	I don't know what you're talking about.
6080100	6082980	Here come the pain, Shrove.
6082980	6084900	I'm still doing this.
6084900	6085900	You're still boosting your.
6085900	6087820	Shrove, if I take you out of this bathroom
6087820	6093980	without knowing anything about the gem, you're.
6093980	6095020	You're as good as dead.
6095020	6096580	It's not going to go well for you.
6096580	6097860	You're as good as dead.
6097860	6099460	This is your last chance.
6099460	6101940	We're from the church.
6101980	6105460	You don't need to know who we are.
6105460	6106900	Nice.
6106900	6111220	We're from people that are better than you at taking gems
6111220	6113620	and getting away with it.
6113620	6115140	I want to say, can I search him?
6115140	6116780	Is there like a frisk move?
6116780	6119660	That's just like he doesn't have the fucking.
6119660	6121700	He's not going to have it.
6121700	6124180	But I just want to see what's like in his pockets.
6124180	6126540	Easy.
6126540	6129740	You move to frisk him, but his hand is like lightning
6129740	6130660	and he shoots out.
6130820	6132620	You didn't even see he was holding a dagger,
6132620	6133620	but he slices you.
6133620	6135100	God damn it.
6135100	6136700	Fuck.
6136700	6137620	Now we're going to die.
6137620	6139180	Slice you for five damage.
6139180	6141380	God, fuck you.
6141380	6144980	Can I cast a spell or can I just can I just do a regular action?
6144980	6146340	Is there soap in the bathroom?
6146340	6148020	You should. Yeah, there is.
6148020	6150060	You should wash that out.
6150060	6151380	Yeah, you could cast something.
6151380	6152780	I think it's Dan's turns first.
6152780	6154540	No, yeah, it is Dan's turn.
6154540	6159060	Well, you've been stabbed now in mid mid frisk.
6159060	6162300	Well, I'm going to reflexively, if someone's stabbing me,
6162300	6164700	inflict moderate wounds.
6164700	6167180	All right, so do you see your touch attack?
6167180	6169300	It's on the other side.
6169300	6172660	It'll be kind of towards your attacks to the left, left.
6172660	6173580	Yeah, around there.
6173580	6175660	Touch attack.
6175660	6177420	Touch 11.
6177420	6178260	It's not that.
6178260	6178760	OK.
6182940	6184980	Unless he's flat footed.
6184980	6188380	He's not, but you grab him.
6189340	6191100	Wait, moderate wounds?
6191100	6192100	How much damage is that?
6192100	6193460	It's inflict moderate wounds.
6193460	6194460	It's like three, right?
6194460	6195300	Two or three?
6195300	6200660	It's, sorry, hold on, shit, had it a second ago.
6200660	6202980	Do you want me to look?
6202980	6208020	Touch deals 2d8 plus 1 damage per level.
6208020	6210500	All right.
6210500	6211460	All right, you hit him.
6211460	6214420	He had necrotic energy oozes through his body
6214420	6216180	as he takes 11 damage.
6217180	6223460	So no, there's a verbal component to my spell.
6223460	6225900	It's OK.
6225900	6226700	All right.
6226700	6228420	How close am I to him?
6228420	6231220	You're maybe 10 feet, but you're kind of coming
6231220	6232500	through the window, right?
6232500	6235300	Can I reach out and grab his shoulder?
6235300	6236980	Are you inside the bathroom at this point?
6236980	6238500	Well, my arm could be.
6238500	6239300	It's a hole.
6239300	6240580	You can't reach through.
6240580	6243260	You'd have to be in the bathroom to kind of reach him.
6243260	6245980	My hand is in the bathroom.
6246780	6249740	So no, you're not even going to roll.
6249740	6252380	No, you can't reach him.
6252380	6256620	You can move to him, and then you'd be able to reach him.
6256620	6257860	Move the window?
6257860	6260260	Move through the window.
6260260	6261660	Well, I don't want to do that yet.
6261660	6262180	That's fine.
6262180	6263500	Are there any rocks?
6263500	6265020	Yeah, there's some rocks.
6265020	6265780	Outside?
6265780	6266260	Yeah.
6266260	6267860	I start throwing rocks through the window.
6270860	6273180	All right.
6273180	6274980	You got a critical fail.
6274980	6275780	Critical fail?
6275860	6276820	Yeah.
6276820	6280260	You wanged Jeff in the head with a rock.
6280260	6282140	I didn't mean to wang you.
6282140	6283660	You hit him for five.
6283660	6284300	I hit him.
6284300	6287700	I take five damage through rocks through the window.
6287700	6289340	He was throwing rocks.
6289340	6291100	How big is this bathroom?
6291100	6292300	It's not big.
6292300	6294260	Well, why did you just do it?
6294260	6297420	Whipping rocks through the window.
6297420	6299540	I heard him as much as the guy that stabbed me.
6299540	6301740	I'm trying to help.
6301740	6304060	I'm trying to help.
6304060	6305580	I'm trying to help.
6305700	6307860	You were the one that said, stay outside.
6307860	6309140	Is there anything natural inside
6309140	6310140	that I can use in Tangle?
6314580	6315620	Not close enough.
6315620	6316820	It's too far away.
6316820	6317420	OK.
6317420	6319100	They can't reach you into the bathroom.
6319100	6324780	Well, then I shillily.
6324780	6325300	All right.
6325300	6327980	I turn my quarterstaff into a shillily
6327980	6333540	and just fucking whack him right in the head.
6333540	6335820	All right, you hit him for seven damage in the head.
6335820	6338980	This guy's got to die soon, right?
6338980	6339660	Not that soon.
6339660	6340260	Is he OK?
6340260	6341900	Like, what's his status?
6341900	6344940	He's doing fine considering he took two, I'm
6344940	6348940	not going to say strong attacks, but pretty solid connections.
6348940	6353340	He's dazzled and dazed and confused.
6353340	6356140	I'm going to throw just one more rock,
6356140	6359940	but I'm going to aim at his legs.
6359940	6361780	Yeah, make it harder.
6361780	6365100	I get out of the way because I've been hurt before.
6365100	6367500	All right, well, first it's everyone else's turn.
6367500	6372140	So Shrove, he kind of ducks down into a ball like a crouch,
6372140	6374820	and then dark energy emanates out from him
6374820	6376660	and covers the bathroom in darkness.
6376660	6380060	Oh, that's just what normally happens in a bathroom.
6383940	6386220	Luckily, the window's open.
6386220	6389100	Oh, the darkness is spilling out of the window.
6389100	6390700	Darkness is spilling out of the window.
6390820	6393500	That hasn't happened since the Super Bowl.
6393500	6395900	Hey, is it day out?
6395900	6397260	It's getting dark.
6397260	6399020	Because of the window.
6399020	6399860	No, no.
6399860	6402500	So he's cast darkness inside the bathroom.
6402500	6403900	Yeah, so you guys can't see so hot.
6403900	6407340	And the darkness is leaking out of the window.
6407340	6410460	Yeah, as if it were like a very bright room with light leaking
6410460	6412260	out, but dark.
6412260	6414060	Wait, hold on.
6414060	6416900	The door gets smashed in, but you can't really
6416900	6418180	see because it's dark.
6418580	6423220	So a blind flash of light behind you kind of opens up.
6423220	6425740	And you see a crush of people pressing in,
6425740	6427740	but no one can really see so well.
6427740	6431460	So just there's, you know, it's like a cartoon scuffle right
6431460	6431940	now.
6431940	6433980	Say, is someone in here?
6433980	6435180	Yeah, yeah.
6435180	6436940	Occupied.
6436940	6438780	There's fists ablazing.
6438780	6439780	They're hitting you.
6439780	6441180	They're hitting everyone.
6441180	6441820	Except me.
6441820	6442540	I'm outside.
6442540	6444460	I'm protected by the outside.
6444460	6445620	That's correct.
6445620	6446820	Thank you.
6446820	6448180	You keep throwing rocks at me.
6448180	6449580	Just once.
6449580	6452420	Just once.
6452420	6453220	These are homemade rocks.
6453220	6454820	All right, only two connect.
6454820	6457220	One hits Jeff and one hits Dan.
6457220	6458020	I'm safe.
6458020	6460780	Who's Jeff?
6460780	6461900	XP.
6461900	6462740	I get XP.
6462740	6463820	Double.
6463820	6469220	I picture this bathroom like the size of an airplane bathroom.
6469220	6472260	I'm picturing the size of like the rush against men.
6472260	6472760	Yeah.
6472760	6477280	I want to get this guy out the window.
6477280	6478200	Yeah.
6478200	6479080	All right.
6479080	6481520	I reach my hand in.
6481520	6482240	You do that.
6482240	6484520	Yeah, and I say throw them to me.
6484520	6485040	Throw them.
6485040	6486400	You guys can't really see so good.
6486400	6488640	How many hits do I take?
6488640	6490960	You took eight damage, and Dan took four damage.
6490960	6492200	So I have eight plus five.
6492200	6494160	So how does this dark work?
6494160	6495440	OK, how does this work?
6495440	6496280	It's hard to see.
6496280	6498880	Think about the opposite of light.
6498880	6500080	Well, I mean, yeah.
6500080	6501040	Like negative light.
6501040	6507600	Yeah, but it's like day outside, right?
6507600	6508640	It's kind of getting dark.
6508640	6513240	So if I light a match in this dark, it does nothing.
6513240	6515920	No, you've never tried that.
6515920	6517320	I tried that.
6517320	6518520	You try it?
6518520	6519020	Yeah.
6519020	6519640	It does nothing.
6519640	6522760	It's too dark.
6522760	6523280	It's magic.
6523280	6525080	You've got to try these things.
6525080	6527680	They didn't teach magic at art school?
6527680	6528400	Jesus.
6528400	6530560	No.
6531120	6534320	I throw cards in there.
6534320	6535520	I think it's Dan's turn now.
6535520	6538200	OK, well, I'm grabbing where I think Shrove is,
6538200	6540880	and I want to shove him toward the window,
6540880	6545400	because I'm like, we've got to get this guy out of here.
6545400	6547640	And I'm kind of hoping and shoving him
6547640	6552200	that I kind of want to be like a badass, but I know I'm not.
6552200	6555640	Like I want to like hit it.
6555640	6558600	Not only am I not avoiding hitting his head,
6558600	6560480	like I kind of hope I do, like I want
6561040	6562560	to go to Steven Seagalem.
6562560	6565640	I know I can't, but I want to.
6565640	6567640	So you're grabbing him, and you're doing what?
6567640	6568800	You're pushing him somewhere?
6568800	6570720	Grabbing him and shoving him toward the window
6570720	6575160	with the intent of getting him close enough to the window
6575160	6577600	that diarrhea junior out there can start grabbing him.
6577600	6581240	And like my long term goal is get him out,
6581240	6584920	like get him incapacitated and shoved out the window.
6584920	6586960	OK.
6586960	6587840	Yeah.
6587840	6590760	You grab someone that you feel like might be him,
6590760	6593520	and you start ushering towards the window.
6593520	6596720	And as you do that, you take some more punches.
6596720	6597520	Great.
6597520	6598640	Only two of them hit.
6598640	6599600	So fun.
6599600	6603440	I don't like the sound of somebody.
6603440	6605640	You take five damage off of that.
6605640	6606840	You get to the window, though.
6610560	6611800	So that's what?
6611800	6612760	14 for you?
6612760	6614320	Yeah.
6614320	6617360	Yeah, I'm close to death.
6617360	6618960	In a sense.
6618960	6620280	In a sense.
6620280	6621600	I have like eight left.
6621600	6623000	That's not bad.
6623000	6626040	I mean, it's not great, but it's not bad.
6626040	6628520	All right, you think he's to the window.
6628520	6629200	Yeah.
6629200	6631200	Or you know you're to that window,
6631200	6634280	unless you got turned around somehow.
6634280	6638240	Grab him, diarrhea.
6638240	6639440	I grab him.
6639440	6641840	All right, you grab him.
6641840	6643360	And I can't see anything because I'm
6643360	6644320	looking into the dark.
6644320	6645320	Right.
6645320	6648480	But behind me is daylight.
6648480	6648980	Dusk.
6653240	6655840	He's so offended because he's spent four years learning
6655840	6661360	how light works at the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design.
6661360	6664560	He's so mad at the idea of dark being able to.
6664560	6666240	It's not my idea.
6666240	6669520	Four years, 80 years ago.
6669520	6671040	I know.
6671040	6673000	But you're like, let me get this straight.
6673600	6675600	Yeah, it's magic.
6675600	6679520	All right, so I start yanking on whoever I'm holding on.
6679520	6680120	You do that.
6680120	6685400	When I'm pulling and yanking and yanking and pulling.
6685400	6686480	Yeah, you do that.
6686480	6687760	You get them about halfway out.
6687760	6690320	You don't get them full way out because you had bad footing
6690320	6693080	or something like your back hurt or something like that.
6693080	6694360	But you get them halfway out.
6694360	6696520	And I'm aware enough to be shouting the whole time.
6696520	6697800	I don't know if this is him.
6697800	6698480	Who is it?
6698480	6699600	Who is it?
6699600	6701040	Because I don't want to.
6701040	6702120	That's probably a good call.
6702120	6703240	Yeah, it's your turn.
6703240	6706840	I use my spell of light.
6706840	6711240	And I cast it on the ceiling.
6711240	6715640	So the ceiling could shine like a torch, right?
6715640	6717640	Oh, just light, right?
6717640	6721040	So I cast light on the ceiling of the bathroom.
6721040	6725160	You cast it and you see the faintest of light pulses.
6725160	6726760	But it's almost immediately wiped out.
6726760	6729480	It's not strong enough to pierce the magical darkness.
6729480	6730440	Fuck me.
6730440	6732200	God damn it.
6732200	6733320	That's it?
6733320	6734000	You can move.
6734000	6736360	I just threw a poof and nothing.
6736360	6737960	Well, at least in a meta sense, we now
6737960	6739960	know you're not being shoved out a window.
6739960	6741040	Yeah, that's true.
6741040	6746040	So did we catch anything in that moment, Spencer?
6746040	6749920	You saw a strobe light flash of just a vicious melee.
6749920	6752400	It seems like most of the tavern people
6752400	6753520	are just punching each other.
6753520	6755560	But they're kind of punching in all directions.
6755560	6757440	So now the bathroom is just filled with people punching?
6757440	6757960	Oh, yeah.
6757960	6759080	It's a madhouse.
6759080	6762600	You can't take two steps without catching a punch.
6762600	6763640	It's caught the window.
6763640	6765000	So that's my turn.
6765000	6766120	No, you can move.
6766120	6768040	I jump out the fucking window.
6768040	6768520	All right.
6768520	6770880	You also get punched a couple times.
6770880	6773880	I start grabbing and yanking him.
6773880	6774880	OK.
6774880	6776800	How much D do I T?
6776800	6780520	You just don't hurt that bad.
6780520	6783520	You take some like their wrist isn't straight or something.
6783520	6784560	Like it doesn't connect.
6784560	6788960	Sounds like that was our title, how much G do I T?
6788960	6790400	Their wrist isn't straight.
6790400	6791080	I don't know.
6791080	6793600	I think you're actually supposed to keep it bent or something.
6793600	6794640	Now I accept that.
6794640	6796800	Remember when you found out when you were a kid,
6796800	6799040	you're not supposed to keep your thumb tucked in your hand
6799040	6801200	when you punch somebody?
6801200	6802360	So you break your thumb?
6802360	6806360	God forbid I punch someone so hard, I hurt myself.
6806360	6807440	What a problem.
6807440	6810400	That's how you TD.
6810400	6811400	That is how you TD.
6814400	6816560	I think I punched someone once.
6816560	6817240	That's not true.
6817240	6818520	I punched a lot of people.
6819280	6820400	They were little kids too.
6820400	6821400	What do you think about that?
6821400	6822720	That's bad ass.
6822720	6823720	And this is last week.
6823720	6825720	I punched a lot of fucking little kids.
6825720	6831160	All right, so is it our turn or is it the NPC bad guy's turn?
6831160	6833160	But it's Dan's turn.
6833160	6836960	Dan, you are kind of sandwiched between what you think
6836960	6839160	is Shrove and Rob Shrob.
6839160	6842720	And Jeff is kind of in the mix there too.
6842720	6845920	We got to get Shrove out this window, out of this melee.
6846080	6851240	My goal, my long term goal is if that dude was Shrove, which
6851240	6854560	I'm not questioning, I grabbed that person,
6854560	6857720	shoving them like a package out the window,
6857720	6859840	and my hope is to go out after them.
6859840	6863520	Because I ain't going out through the bathroom door.
6863520	6870240	So you push the guy through.
6870240	6872720	And the window is now clear for axis
6872720	6874680	if you want to squeeze through.
6874680	6875440	You do that.
6876440	6879360	You take one more punch on the butt and you take six damage.
6879360	6882240	Ow, that brings me close to death.
6882240	6883480	Six butt damage.
6883480	6887040	Someone punched me in the ass and might have killed me.
6887040	6889360	I start laughing and pointing.
6889360	6892120	I have some heal spells and some good berries.
6892120	6893760	The most lethal butt punch.
6893760	6895640	The punch of the butt caused more damage
6895640	6897600	than when the guy stabbed me.
6897600	6900160	And when my friend threw a rock through the window
6900160	6901160	and then my friend's hook.
6901960	6905640	But I'm saying it's not funny.
6905640	6906880	I know it's not funny.
6906880	6907840	I'm sorry.
6907840	6909240	It's not funny.
6909240	6909720	You're right.
6909720	6911520	It's not funny.
6911520	6915960	I hope you don't die from getting punched in the butt.
6915960	6918280	My ass.
6918280	6921400	You got punched where the sun don't shine
6921400	6925280	because it's dark in that bathroom because he didn't
6925280	6925760	spell.
6926520	6933000	I'm hanging out the window like crying blood because someone.
6933000	6934080	I know it's terrible.
6934080	6935400	I'm really sorry.
6935400	6936680	I take him by the hand.
6936680	6938280	My balls are helping him.
6938280	6943560	I'm like one of those kids from that horrible orphanage.
6943560	6944720	I'm not laughing at you.
6944720	6946600	I'm laughing at the situation.
6946600	6948080	It's not your fault.
6948080	6948600	God damn.
6948600	6956240	We're doing this for the church.
6956240	6957840	Am I outside?
6957840	6960920	No it's your turn and you can be outside.
6960920	6962560	I try to jump outside.
6962560	6963640	All right you do that.
6963640	6965240	This window is like a Lily Tomlin.
6965240	6970120	Can you see outside?
6970120	6971760	Now that you're clear of the window
6971760	6973240	and it's not blasting out dark.
6973240	6975400	Do we have Shrove or do we not?
6975400	6975880	You do.
6975880	6977920	Yeah we got Shrove.
6978560	6979360	So we got Shrove.
6979360	6980560	We're all outside now.
6980560	6981800	We should rough them up.
6981800	6983720	Yeah no we should beat the piss out of them.
6983720	6986720	We should rough them up a bit and go hey you think that's funny?
6986720	6989600	You're making it dark in the bathroom?
6989600	6991760	My friend got punched in the butt.
6991760	6994560	Is it my turn?
6994560	6997560	You have an action but you can't move.
6997560	6998640	I can't do a spell?
6998640	7001360	No you could do a spell.
7001360	7007480	I summon nature's ally and throw a bear into the bathroom.
7007520	7009200	They have to deal with that shit.
7009200	7011720	Nicely done.
7011720	7012680	That goes great.
7012680	7014360	I summon a bear.
7014360	7016520	And it's still dark in there.
7016520	7019760	OK after he does that I know it's not my turn.
7019760	7020960	I'm going to close the window.
7025840	7029280	So we got a full on bear in the fucking bathroom
7029280	7032480	and we're going to bone out with Shrove.
7032480	7034480	And I'm covering Shrove with my body
7034480	7037120	because I just don't want him to get away.
7037760	7040120	Did I successfully cast a bear into the bathroom?
7040120	7043240	Yeah it's tearing shit up.
7043240	7045920	All right this fucking guy is out of here.
7045920	7046920	That toilet keeps flushing.
7046920	7049040	These guys are going to be busy for a while with that bear.
7049040	7055240	I hurt him in the flushing of the toilet.
7055240	7056800	Let's get Shrove.
7056800	7059000	This guy's a friend of the town we're going to go somewhere.
7059000	7061560	Yeah we got to rough him up a bit.
7061560	7063720	I grab him by the arm and I start shaking him
7063720	7064720	and I go what the fuck is that?
7064720	7066280	We've got to get him out of here we're in the street.
7066360	7067920	We've got to get him out of here.
7067920	7069280	We've got to get you out of here.
7069280	7071480	I shake him by the arm and I look around
7071480	7074720	to see if there's a place that we can hide ourselves.
7074720	7076000	We've got to hide you somewhere.
7076000	7078400	We've got to get you out of here.
7078400	7079640	What are you doing back there?
7079640	7081080	How long do you think a bear is going
7081080	7083480	to last with the X amount of people in the bathroom?
7083480	7084200	10 rounds.
7084200	7085000	10 rounds?
7085000	7085880	How many rounds?
7085880	7087120	10 rounds they'll never forget.
7087120	7088080	We've got 10 rounds.
7088080	7088960	We're fine.
7088960	7091120	They're going to be giving bumper stickers for finishing
7091120	7092920	the night in that place.
7092920	7094720	We could get this guy out of here.
7094720	7095840	Out of here.
7096040	7098720	So you're behind the market.
7098720	7102080	You're kind of between the back row of the market buildings
7102080	7103840	and then the outer wall of the town.
7103840	7106000	So it's kind of a natural alley.
7106000	7109480	But it's also like it's in an area that's heavily populated.
7109480	7112720	So unless you get somewhere out of line of sight or something.
7112720	7113520	What am I wearing?
7116640	7118200	Any kind of robe?
7118200	7119840	Is he wearing colorful clothes like me or no?
7119840	7122040	Yeah, you're wearing colorful clothes like a robe.
7122040	7123080	God, is it brilliant?
7123080	7124360	No.
7124360	7127320	It's like a clown costume.
7127320	7131280	OK, he's going to put his jacket over Shrove's head.
7131280	7131760	Yeah.
7131760	7133080	This is brilliant.
7133080	7136640	In fact, also, I got the Shrove robe.
7136640	7138560	I bought the Shrove robe from the homeless guy.
7138560	7139160	Right, yeah.
7139160	7141440	I'm going to just take that, wrap his head in that.
7141440	7143520	Shrove robe.
7143520	7145360	The bloody Shrove robe.
7145360	7146280	Whatever you want.
7146280	7149880	Right, wrap his head like paparazzi avoidance style.
7149880	7152680	I start shouting, everybody out of the way.
7152680	7155080	Ugliest man in the world.
7155080	7156200	You don't want to see this.
7156200	7158960	He's so ugly.
7158960	7160320	We have a chance.
7160320	7163560	I pat Shrove down to see what's on him.
7163560	7164920	He's got a dagger.
7164920	7165440	A dagger.
7165440	7166200	I take the dagger.
7166200	7167040	Take the dagger.
7167040	7168400	He stabs at you.
7168400	7169200	What?
7169200	7170560	I took the dagger.
7170560	7172080	No, you're reaching for it.
7172080	7173360	Oh.
7173360	7174960	Yeah, he stabbed you.
7174960	7177840	I shake his other arm and I go, what are you doing?
7177840	7179280	How many of these do I tease?
7179280	7180560	Stab it, people.
7180560	7182160	Five more of these?
7182240	7183120	Five more damage.
7183120	7183800	Fuck, I know.
7183800	7184480	I shake him.
7184480	7185000	I shake him.
7185000	7187000	Why are you stabbing you people?
7187000	7189400	You pull it out of the, you pull it out of his hand
7189400	7190520	after that, though.
7190520	7192960	Because of the arm shaking.
7192960	7197120	Well, we need to incapacitate this guy.
7197120	7198600	Why don't you punch him in the butt?
7198600	7199400	Almost kill him.
7203200	7205480	He goes, why are you guys, what is this?
7205480	7207520	You're not taking me alive.
7207520	7208440	I'm going to kill you.
7208440	7210200	Hey, hey, hey, yeah, dagger.
7210200	7214920	Hey, dagger guy, long pooper, do you have a Patcheons gem?
7214920	7216920	I don't know what you're talking about.
7216920	7217760	Who is Patcheons?
7217760	7220240	We're trying to find Patcheons gem.
7220240	7222840	That sounds like, is that a famous person?
7222840	7224040	The gem, you prick.
7224040	7226520	You fucking waylaid us on the highway,
7226520	7229800	coming from a little, little knock.
7229800	7234960	Where the fuck, my character would remember this stuff.
7234960	7236200	Don't fucking lie to us.
7236200	7237520	Yeah, don't waylay us.
7237520	7239080	I've been here for months.
7239080	7240400	I'm like the town doctor.
7240400	7241880	I don't leave.
7241880	7244120	I have a lot of chronic patience and stuff.
7244120	7246440	I'm not just going around, hanging out.
7246440	7248480	Where'd you get this robe, you piece of shit?
7248480	7251240	I found it at the theater.
7251240	7252640	You work at the theater.
7252640	7253240	Right, yeah.
7253240	7255080	And so I was like, well, this bloody robe
7255080	7257680	seems too dirty to be with the other costumery.
7257680	7259080	I'm going to get rid of this.
7259080	7260240	And there was a naked man.
7260240	7263120	And hey, that works out great.
7263120	7265440	You're a fucking idiot liar.
7265440	7267560	OK.
7267560	7269120	I take his dagger.
7269120	7270200	Do I have his dagger?
7270200	7270680	Yeah.
7270680	7273000	I stab him back.
7273000	7274160	You stab him.
7274160	7275600	Well, hey, huh?
7275600	7277520	She was on the other foot.
7277520	7279080	He takes five damage.
7279080	7279600	Yeah.
7279600	7282040	I still have the dagger.
7282040	7283440	And I go, hey, I'll keep stabbing
7283440	7285160	until you tell us where that gem is at.
7285160	7286800	I don't know what you're talking about.
7286800	7287600	I stab him again.
7287600	7292600	You start gabbing, or we keep stabbing.
7292600	7294360	All right, you deal five damage.
7294360	7296680	Does anybody see us?
7297520	7299760	Well, he is screaming out in pain.
7299760	7301920	And you haven't really made distance
7301920	7303840	between you and the back of the tavern.
7303840	7307400	We should really take him somewhere.
7307400	7308360	Yeah, he's wounded.
7308360	7310320	You see a group of people rounding the corner
7310320	7311080	on one side.
7311080	7313480	OK, let's get the hell out of here.
7313480	7314800	Nothing here to see.
7314800	7316200	Church of the Silver Flame.
7316200	7317840	Church of the Silver Flame.
7317840	7318600	Fuck you.
7318600	7319600	You don't want to be next.
7319600	7320520	Fuck all y'all.
7320520	7321360	You want to be next?
7321360	7322360	Keep fucking stabbing.
7322360	7324640	This guy, you don't know him.
7324720	7326280	He's got rope over his face.
7326280	7328320	The Church of the Silver Flame don't give a shit.
7328320	7330200	We don't give a shit.
7330200	7331640	There's a rope over his face.
7331640	7332520	He's really ugly.
7332520	7334800	You don't want to see this person.
7334800	7338160	Just round a different, keep rounding corners.
7338160	7341040	Just go find something more profitable to look at.
7341040	7342280	Unless you want to help you.
7342280	7344640	You don't want to see this.
7344640	7346160	You forget a million things a day.
7346160	7347160	Make this one of them.
7347160	7350480	I hear there's an interesting dark bathroom
7350480	7353240	with some animal life.
7353240	7354800	Can I cast a spell?
7354800	7355480	Sure, yeah.
7360040	7363400	I produce flame.
7363400	7366760	And I just hold a flame in my hands.
7366760	7369240	Yeah, can I cast a flame in both hands
7369240	7371120	or where I just hold a flame in both hands?
7371120	7372280	Like just hold flames?
7372280	7373760	Yeah, I think the produce flame lets
7373760	7374960	you have a couple of flames.
7374960	7378000	So I just stand there and go like,
7378000	7382440	I just hold flames in both hands and go, who wants to get burnt?
7382800	7385880	How do you like your ribs?
7385880	7386360	What?
7386360	7389040	How do you like your ribs?
7389040	7390440	How do you like your ribs?
7390440	7391960	Yeah.
7391960	7396560	I look over at Carlos and go, how do you like your ribs?
7396560	7397040	Yeah.
7397040	7397880	And they?
7397880	7398920	No, you ask him.
7398920	7401880	I ask the crowd, how do you like your ribs?
7401880	7402760	No, you do.
7402760	7404680	OK.
7404680	7405520	It doesn't matter.
7405520	7406680	It doesn't matter.
7406680	7409320	I have two flames.
7409320	7412000	I look at the crowd and people around the crowd and go,
7412040	7413360	how do you like your ribs?
7413360	7414640	No, not them.
7414640	7418400	We don't want to care how they like their ribs.
7418400	7420920	You say to the back, it's like saying, do you feel lucky punk?
7420920	7422680	Are you saying to the person that you're going to burn?
7422680	7424000	How do you like your ribs?
7424000	7426200	There's a whole group of people coming around the corner.
7426200	7427720	Yeah, we don't want them.
7427720	7429040	We don't want to give them ribs.
7429040	7433960	But OK, so why did you whisper that to me?
7433960	7434800	It doesn't matter.
7434800	7436560	It doesn't matter.
7436560	7439880	I still take the advice that look at a crowd
7439880	7442800	because it's the most confusing thing in the world.
7442800	7450440	I'm now a gnome holding two fireballs in my hand.
7450440	7451720	Look at this crowd of people.
7451720	7455160	I go, how do you like your ribs?
7455160	7455960	Cliffhanger!
7462920	7463480	Fuckin' did it.
7463480	7464800	Rob Schaub, everybody.
7464800	7473320	Let's give it up for Church, Nolan, Sarah, Chris, Zach,
7473320	7477920	everybody here at the wonderful Starbirds Industries Castle.
7477920	7480520	Spencer Crichton, and if you're game master.
7480520	7482720	I'm Jeff Davis, a comptroller.
7482720	7486040	Jan Harmon, your mayor.
7486040	7486640	Very fast.
7486640	7488920	Take chances.
7488920	7492760	We got a guy off the toilet, and now.
7494800	7510680	Did you get any of that?
7510680	7512080	It's a good a show.
7521080	7521560	Yo.
7521560	7529480	Little prancing ponies, little prancing gentlemen,
7529480	7532000	little prancing ponies.
7532000	7538000	Bring them to the stable when they're rode hard, left dry,
7538000	7542080	going in the field to eat the lollipop rainbows,
7542080	7545240	little prancing ponies.
7545240	7549640	MC prancing pony, here to tell you I'm a brony.
7549640	7552880	Going to eat the cinnamon wheat good.
7552880	7556320	Ride with my pony feet up a rainbow ramp, go to rainbow
7556320	7560320	town, meet another prancing podium frown.
7560320	7562400	And he'll say, what's up?
7562400	7565840	He'll say, give me a rainbow cup, give me a cup with
7565840	7567120	rainbows in it.
7567120	7569360	Fuck your mama so hard, I didn't win it.
