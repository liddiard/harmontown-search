202300	209980	And gay it's okay, it's alright to be a gay nectarine then this is probably a shitty theater to sit in for a half hour
210540	216900	Like no, you got popcorn and whatnot. You got this. I mean, that's the thing you get the popcorn and then you're like god damn

238020	243280	You think La Croix is bad for you if you drink like let's say if you knew a guy who drinks like 18 a day
243900	246300	They're bad for you. If you like things that taste good
248700	253960	Spencer Spencer, huh? Yeah, hashtag cold take
257380	259580	How are you Spencer, oh, I'm great
259980	263180	I was at I was at this restaurant the other night and
263900	270420	In the middle of it felt music completely changed. It got really really loud and some emcee of sorts was like well
270420	272420	everybody we're about to welcome the
272940	275220	Samba dancers and then two
275820	280460	Samba dancers came out and we're just standing in front of the table and not standing they danced out
280460	287060	And we're dancing in the front of the table about ten feet from where I was and it's just the music was was unending
287060	291260	and it was just so loud and it's like I don't want to look at this because it just seems like a
291660	295020	Spectacle that I don't want to be a part of and I never asked for and I was just looking to eat
295060	300860	You know and it was just it was just a mess and I was just stewing and everyone else was having a fun time
300860	304860	They were taking videos and laughing and stuff. Where are you Whole Foods?
304860	309900	That was a whole I was that whole food Chuck E. Cheese. I was at the hot case, you know
309900	315500	They have this barbecue this barbecue hot case. It's great. They got like Lobster Mac
315500	322100	I got my notes down on a butterfly envelope now. There's like what the fuck nobody gives a shit anymore
322100	326460	I mean, it's like it's like, you know old uncle Harmon pulled away everyone's pension
326460	332420	You know now everybody nobody's nobody's nobody's nobody's kissing anymore ass like they used to we can't afford notebooks
332420	335100	Okay, we got true colors coming out from I used to bring my own
335100	339820	Yeah, I gave up like I stopped bringing my my iPad. So this is on you. Yeah
339820	344420	If you don't have the tools that you used to bring I'm saying is their paper
344780	352480	The answer was yes, Jeff. Is there something you think me to take a note about because he writes down good my modified stylus
352900	354900	galaxy note 10 plus
356900	361160	Oh don't encourage him he do not encourage this
363540	368140	Thank You Steve for my butterfly note, yeah, okay
369580	373320	Why do you have a Samsung device, huh? Is it fun?
375220	379660	Yeah, I got this because I miss the old I Harmon and
380060	384640	I want to I'm gonna fit this with a lanyard and I'm gonna wear it around my neck
384640	389280	No, you're not and I'm gonna remain an iPhone user because I don't want to be one of these green bubble people
389280	391600	But I'm just gonna have this around my neck
393040	400120	Because society's left me no choice because there is no such thing as an electronic notepad. That is the size of a notepad
400200	406040	There's a million brains of like $30 electronic notepad or baby's first notepad
406040	408040	Like they're all like 8 inches 12 inches
408320	412320	The smallest one I could find is I think called like a moba script or something
412320	417440	It looks everything looks like I look like a deaf person from the 1800s. Like if I wear it around my neck
418000	420680	no offense to the 1800s, but I
421880	424920	Like I'm just saying like it's like a certain dimension of thing
424920	429880	You just look like you look like Laura Ingalls Wilder and I like a very special little house like
430760	434020	But you know and this is gonna look totally cool cool
435400	436680	Fine, it's pretty hot
436680	440480	But I think I could take like I think what I can do is I can go I can take like a mead
441000	446800	Spiral notebook cover and put it over like I don't know I could make my own custom case
447200	452440	So that it just looks like why I just have to be right in your neck because I need to as quickly as possible
452880	457520	Perhaps while in the middle of a conversation you ain't got time to reach into that pocket
457800	463040	No, you want it to be right right by your sternum and your life-weight process. Yeah, that's correct
463040	465040	Did you want the answer to your question? Yes
465440	470680	Yeah, cuz that is correct. It's a matter of milliseconds like it's a matter of like hey Jeff
470680	476880	Take a quick note with your iPhone. I want you to make a quick note of something about what? Oh, don't forget
477800	480040	Dr. Zhivago is showing at the arc light
480640	483520	Tuesday while you ask me I reached in my pocket and pulled out
483520	486960	Oh, yeah, don't forget to turn it on don't forget to find the fucking app
486960	492920	Don't forget to thumb Zhivago in half the after the seven autocorrects where it says do you mean Zimbabwe?
493120	495840	Like and then the entire time you're doing it
495840	501280	I think you're a tool because it looks like you're tweeting or texting. What was your question about dr. Zhivago?
501280	504760	I didn't have fucking questions. You did and then you interrupted the fucking answer
506040	512240	I want to be able to eliminate the barriers the answer is a tester neck between my thoughts and
514520	516520	Containing David Lee
516720	521760	So you pull this out? This is Omar Sharif the Samsung Galaxy note 10 plus
521760	525840	I know all the answers to that shit. It's a thousand dollar electronic notepad
526120	531240	You think about getting that fold one the one that folds it folds in you gotta get that fold
532640	536720	Spencer Dan doesn't have time to open up an item. Well, yeah
538560	543680	Milliseconds count it has to be unfolded before he even is asked a question
543680	548560	I mean, I agree a hundred percent with that. That's the reason I used to carry like a moleskin, you know
549440	553360	Was not fast enough for me so I super glued a little nipple to it
554080	559360	What does that do? It makes it faster to because I like push you've pushed on the s pen
559360	562400	It's like flush with the bottom and then you can like dig it out with your thumbnails
562400	565720	Like what's the point of that click? So I super good a little nipple to it
566560	573120	The cool thing about the galaxy note 10 plus. I don't know if like galaxy note 10 9 plus you had this already
573120	580400	But I'm pleased with the technology now because they finally managed with a thousand dollars of electronics to actually surpass a regular
580480	584480	Notebook because you don't have to turn a page but you can do everything else
584800	588720	You pick it up you take the fucking pen out as soon as you do
588880	594080	It goes into a mode that you can write any kind of fucking aids shit, whatever no, whatever
596400	598080	And then you can give your phone
598080	599120	I didn't have to do anything
599120	604400	But take the pen out as with a regular thing and then when I put it back in it saves it goes back to sleep
604560	606640	Boom bam turn and cures it
608000	610000	Hell yeah, congratulations samsung
610880	616880	You've beaten the fucking 1950s notebook. Finally. God damn it with this technology
617280	620320	It's like it's like it's like nobody ever nobody ever makes anything for me
622720	625200	You know, there's a million kinds of like you know
625280	631520	They got the technology necessary to make an interactive whiteboard that stores all of your the prizes of breaking a story
631600	635280	I could have I you know how much you know how much magic's going on up here?
635280	640240	That's everyone missed out on i'm i'm like semi-retired now. No one's ever going to know how I did what I did
641440	643440	All right, but they could
643840	650080	God that tech was there they'd be so excited. Have you have you tried writing things down on butterfly envelope? I
650960	652320	Can't do it
652320	656880	I can't do it because then i'll have a butterfly envelope with some shit written on it and then it's like
656960	662160	Oh, I want you to take a photo of this bring it into an app that scans it with ocr
662400	668080	And fucking like turns that into text. It's like go blow it out your ass world. What? Yeah

1542560	1544560	Oh
1546080	1551280	Man so I just watched the second adams family movie you guys
1552160	1554160	These guys are fucking twisted
1554240	1560240	Like morticia adams. She gives birth and like during labor. She's like into it
1561280	1565280	Which I was like, I was the whole movie. I was thinking about that. I'm like, that's so funny
1565440	1567360	Like when do you ever see?
1567360	1573920	You know pregnancy in the birth giving process is like pleasurable at night. Like she's like, yeah, i'm loving this
1574240	1579440	It's like, you know, usually someone's screaming bloody murder or it's like kind of done in in. Uh, what do you call it?
1579840	1586640	Like uh without any words, you know, you just hear music because non-spooky, uh women when they give birth they're like oh
1586960	1592240	This is scary. It's painful and I don't like it. She's like, oh i'm getting ripped up
1592400	1599520	I love everything that hurts. Yeah, I love childbirth. That's a really that's foggy, man. No, that's it's funny. It's funny
1599760	1605280	It's like oh, I love childbirth because it hurts. Yeah, because that's how twisted there is a child
1605280	1607280	But then did she look at the baby and go?
1608320	1611120	Gross. I think she does. Yeah, I think they do that
1611360	1617200	It's so innocent and then and then the the the dracula doctor's like but it could end up like murder
1617760	1619760	And she's like, okay
1620160	1623040	Then I love it and then I love it as much as cold soup
1624160	1626160	That's your name cold soup
1627840	1631120	Yeah, that's what happens it's a great it's a great film
1632480	1635920	And then and then uh gomez comes in and goes, honey
1636560	1640720	I just heard the polar ice caps are melting. Oh good
1642400	1648960	Yes, this global warming is really the cat's pajamas because they just love bad stuff. Yeah, it's it's so good. Yeah
1649760	1654320	They're like, uh, the kids are trying to kill the baby and it's horrifying, but the baby doesn't die
1654400	1656400	And so then it's fine and not horrifying
1656880	1658880	They probably can't die
1658960	1661920	Yeah, more or less. It like stops a guillotine with its bare hand
1662640	1666880	What it's like a superhero baby because otherwise it would die and that would be horrible
1668400	1675600	Otherwise they'd just be killing a baby. Do you think that's how the the thing not the thing thing their their hand character
1676560	1680480	Maybe that that was one of their first kids and like pugsley and
1681200	1686480	Wednesday, what's your name? Yeah, Wednesday that they successfully they they put it in a guillotine and it reached up with his hand
1686480	1691600	But it didn't have steel skin. So it just got its hands severed and then they're like, what are you doing?
1691760	1694560	Did you kids murder your your our baby?
1695280	1696880	We had to
1696880	1703360	Come here. You wonderful kids. I love murder because we're at take after my your dad or whatever
1703680	1705680	Well, we'll just put the hand in a box
1706400	1713520	And it'll be our friend. What's uh, what's pug? What's pugsley's deal in this movie? He's like a mean kid
1714160	1716160	He's he's often he's often
1716160	1720880	Uh a victim of wednesday's sadistic schemes, right?
1721440	1727520	But does he have a power? Does he know he's just kind of a he's a dumb. He's like dumb
1727600	1731920	His his main thing. He's like dumb. He can he can he can he can like dangle
1732560	1734720	Weights from his pierced dick
1740720	1744960	He's really they don't they don't show that in the movies because he's like a kid in the movies. Yeah
1746400	1753460	What in the comic book in the alan more original material he's like 30 and he works at a carnival
1755520	1760640	And he he does like body modifications he fucking loves sounding he can't get enough sounding
1760800	1766080	What is that? Wait, what is that? I think it's when you you like insert rods into your urethra. Oh
1767280	1769280	Pugsley loves oh, that's too far
1772400	1776000	No, it's painful you just made a father fuck a child with a car
1778160	1780160	But not a rod
1781440	1783440	I don't like that rod. Isn't that uncomfortable?
1784080	1788960	To think about too much true crime. Yeah, there's too many true crime stories with uh, yeah
1789200	1792400	It's like there was like some guy that like tortured kids. It was like bad
1793120	1796000	How much weight dan do you think and like let's say like?
1797760	1804880	Am I gonna gain yeah, how much weight like in kilograms or pounds do you think you could dangle from your dick? Oh
1806560	1811840	I don't think I feel like zero like I don't I don't I don't feel like even a pound
1812800	1815840	Like I don't let's say you had a very comfortable rod already in there
1815920	1820880	I don't that was nice. That was like structural like sterilized and good to go
1821520	1824080	You could like you could put like like, you know
1825040	1830400	A couple ounces on that probably though. I don't think so. I could do like maybe two pounds. I feel
1831360	1835200	I think I can maybe two pounds is a lot off your dick. Well, how long are we talking?
1837360	1839920	Like is that all day because I don't want to know I think
1840880	1844960	Five five seconds. Yeah, I think two pounds at the time. Does it matter?
1845360	1849200	It's not like I can slowly rip your dick off like right. That's what i'm saying
1849920	1855440	Oh, I know. I I'm just like like like no like the the problems that are gonna happen are gonna happen right away
1856960	1860640	And so i'm like no no pounds no no pounds
1861600	1862240	uh
1862240	1864400	What about you Jeff? Let's say that you
1865360	1870480	Could cure leukemia if you dangled five pounds of weight off your cock
1871360	1876000	For 15 seconds. I'd do that. I'm not letting you this is a gotcha question
1878720	1881920	You you'd rather let people die of leukemia there's children out there dad
1883040	1887440	I didn't say that and your dick is so precious to you that you couldn't dangle five pounds of weight off of it
1887680	1893360	I don't I don't I'm not buying into your scenario. I think leukemia is caused by disingenuous friendships
1894320	1895680	Whoa
1895680	1897680	all right, um
1898240	1901040	Like to bring up our first guest timmy, uh, no, okay
1904080	1906080	He couldn't make it today
1909600	1913040	Either because I refuse to mutilate myself or because jeff
1915760	1922000	Um, yeah, well moving right along got a lot of show to get through here tonight, so let's keep it moving
1922720	1924880	Uh, jeff, what does your envelope say so far?
1925520	1927680	It says well, it's not a whole lot
1928640	1930640	It says memory sprite and father
1931680	1935360	Dangle weights from his penis. Well, hey you wrote that down. I
1936960	1942080	Usually write just things down you just write them down and you but then did you write it down before you said it?
1942400	1945760	No, I write it down and think later on if it's a callback
1946320	1950960	Like I can look at the thing but right now i'm too dazzled by the fact there's butterflies everywhere
1951040	1955040	And so normally I have a lot more notes than than just those two things
1955920	1958080	Did you you guys know about the feral hog?
1959760	1965040	I gotta shoot like the guy that had to shoot he had to murder 30 to 50 feral hogs in the space of five minutes
1965040	1967760	Or something. Well anybody listen to that podcast reply all
1968800	1970800	Yeah, that's kind of fun. Wait, what happened?
1970960	1973600	Uh, well, there was this kind of I don't know if you call it a meme
1973680	1979680	There was like a trope thing a phenomena online where like there was some there was some assault rifle
1979920	1983200	Talk going on on twitter and then there was a guy no one needs an assault rifle
1983200	1987600	Who needs an assault rifle and then someone's tweeted and said a question for
1988320	1990000	rural
1990000	1992000	America how
1992000	1996000	How do I deal with the 30 to 50 feral hogs that run into my yard?
1996000	2001840	Well, my two to three children are playing every 10 minutes or whatever the fuck something really specific and everybody was like having a gas
2001840	2006480	With it because it was kind of silly. It just seemed like a guy that was just making up a reason why you wouldn't need an assault rifle
2007040	2014480	Um, and he was but but but then the reply all podcast which is which is really great. It's a great podcast like
2014880	2016000	uh
2016000	2020880	It as it as it always does like it just went down the rabbit hole of that story first
2021580	2022880	contacting that guy
2022880	2028800	Who as always on reply all turns out to be a wonderful human being who's like totally gets why it's funny
2029040	2034000	He's like there is like there is like do you understand why everyone like foot was like retweeting it?
2034080	2037360	Meghan was like yeah. No, it's a it's a it's a ridiculous tweet
2037440	2040400	Like I was I was like what's ridiculous to you about it's like wow
2040400	2043520	It's just the first of all 30 to 50 is a weird number
2044400	2049360	Like he ran down the whole thing. It was like they but but also the guy was like, you know
2049360	2056080	It's like oh shit. This feral hog thing is a real thing and he did have that experience. Basically. He didn't have an assault rifle
2056640	2057840	um
2057840	2060240	But he was just sort of like in the moment
2060320	2065600	He was like from his own life experiences like saying here's a reason you'd need an assault rifle
2066160	2073220	Um, and and then and then so then the episode continues to just go into this whole feral hog thing, which is fucking fascinating
2074000	2081440	Um, so the spanyards when they came when they when they were conquistadoring or whatever like they would they would like uh,
2081600	2083600	Conquering is that problematic?
2083840	2085840	um, they would I guess it was like a
2086400	2091280	Medieval thing to like you would bring pigs with you and this is already cool
2091600	2094720	like like like this is such this is such a weird like
2095500	2099440	Minecrafty kind of like what was it modern ish kind of thinking like the
2100240	2103200	guys who were in the business of of like colonial
2103980	2105980	Imperialistic just like fucking world
2106080	2108240	paving like they would just bring
2108880	2115280	hogs with them because they fuck like rabbits and they're they turn everything they eat into bacon
2115600	2120480	Which you and and so they you just take a couple pigs with you when you get on a ship
2120880	2125520	And wherever you land if there's a forest you kick their little asses out of the boat
2125600	2131280	You know, they're gonna go fuck and like raise like the pigs are like the fastest reproducing
2132080	2135520	mammals or something like that, which I find astonishing and uh
2136080	2141440	And the way they describe it is like they basically do all the foraging you would otherwise have to do and they turn every acorn leaf
2141680	2146000	insect they turn it all into one big mobile fucking pork unit
2147520	2151360	And and and they wouldn't um, they wouldn't build hens
2152880	2154880	mobile parking
2156960	2158560	Jeff's writing it down
2158560	2163680	I want to see the day when that comes in handy when somebody like stumbles up to you on a sidewalk goes like
2163760	2167120	What did he say about this and you're like this is mobile pork unit
2168080	2172400	Um, he's getting a little little little creased up envelope in your in your in your pocket
2172560	2179200	But but I just think that's fascinating because particularly it's um, it's not what we associate with like agrarian society
2179280	2182560	It was like they would let the pigs they wanted them to flourish
2182640	2183120	Right
2183120	2189220	So it was like it was sort of like you let the pigs out into the wild and then you start conquistadoring
2190060	2192060	Knowing that wherever you go
2192700	2196540	As you're looking for your fountains of youth or whatever the fuck you're doing like that
2196780	2203100	You've now seeded this land with these mobile fucking pork units. So you're just gonna run across them
2203100	2207020	They're easy to hunt they've they've turned everything into pork and you just go
2208060	2212220	And you just eat it and then you keep moving. I I just find it's so like
2212940	2216700	Like disgustingly human like it's such a beautiful thing
2216860	2224220	And now we're suffering for it like all these centuries later. These are there's there's like there was a sort of like dormant pig population
2224700	2228620	Um, here's the craziest most ironic thing about it
2229020	2233500	So so that when the feral pig problem suddenly starts to blossom in the united states
2233900	2238940	The first instinct given our lessons we've learned from the passenger pigeon and thing just go. This is easy
2239020	2244300	we know what to do open season on feral pigs have added america and uh
2244780	2246780	little problem there like uh
2248460	2250460	Killing pigs is like
2251820	2254140	It's if you're if you're down for killing
2254700	2259500	Like it is the like open season on pigs is like way cooler than open season on pigeons
2259820	2265580	Like like you get to now take quarter sticks of dynamite and create booby traps where pigs are flying in the air
2265900	2269340	You you get to pop in a helicopter and have a headset and just go
2270300	2276300	Um, like they fuck so fast they they're they're ready to fuck again six months after they're born
2276780	2281180	Um, and they're like the but here's the crazy irony to it
2281980	2285820	The reason they're spreading out of control is because it's legal to hunt them
2286220	2294300	And it's fun to hunt them for some people like tourists and things like there's a thriving business and industry
2294860	2297100	it's kind of like the poaching thing where it's like
2298060	2303820	There are people in the world who never want these things to go extinct because they now have a way to make
2304220	2308220	lots of money i.e charging tickets to like
2308620	2312460	Bring you along to fuck up pigs and your weird jigsaw
2313420	2318140	I know a couple chefs that they pay to go out and hunt wild boar so they can
2318620	2324620	Get you know boar bacon and you know, like render boar fat. There are farmers out there
2325100	2325740	uh
2325740	2333180	That who whose videos are almost indistinguishable from the kind of like horrible kind of like guys who are laughing with glee as they're like
2333180	2334860	Blowing up these these pigs
2334860	2338780	but like the differences like there are farmers out there who wish they were just
2339100	2342140	All gone and who are not enjoying killing
2342760	2349820	Thousands of them a week going out four nights a week at three in the morning on three wheelers with assault rifles going on
2350060	2356700	And just like night vision and apparently these things are so smart. You can't trap them the same way twice if you trap a pig
2357660	2359660	And another pig sees it
2360380	2362380	No other pigs ever going to fall for that trap
2363100	2368300	It sounds like a joke, but it's like if you if you if they build a house out of straw like uh
2370300	2372940	Another one's got one made out of brick the next day. It's crazy
2374620	2378460	They tried introducing wolves into the wild and all and now we just now we just got homeless pigs
2378860	2385020	But you you you have a bunch of dudes with uh with guns running around killing pigs, but they're they're breeding faster
2385500	2390860	well, also these guys but it's like it's like that's the super irony to me is like they um
2391580	2394620	They they like the guy in jurassic park three
2394620	2399580	It's like like they abscond with fucking pig like they breed them and they spread them
2400460	2407980	Because they're they're their bread and butter pork is their bread and butter like they they're they're here's here's something crazy
2408780	2410860	Here's how huge the problem is jeff
2410860	2411900	large
2411900	2413900	pita and the
2414300	2416140	national
2416140	2417340	feral hog
2417340	2419420	genocide
2419420	2426640	Enthusiasts like I don't know what they're called like the american farmers association who are who are like suffering the brunt of this like infestation
2427340	2434220	pita and those guys are arm in arm just because even pita is like
2435020	2439260	This madness has to stop and the like the the like like like
2439820	2444460	It has to stop in the most humane way possible. Like they they they lobby together
2444620	2450220	That's how fucked up the situation is and there are people that are like, uh, let's poison them all
2450620	2456780	And but the poi to poison a thing that is like the size of a human means what are you gonna use?
2456940	2458940	Look at how much rat poison, you know
2458940	2462780	Are you gonna put and then and then and then it's like this like crazy thing like and that's actually the point
2462780	2466060	we've gotten to that's the end of the story is that actually even the people that are like
2466360	2471100	environmentalists who are like if you if you poison these these pig population enough to like
2471580	2474540	Try to wipe them out. It means poisoning the earth
2475100	2479340	Around them. It means poisoning the entire biosphere everything that eats those carcasses
2479740	2482780	Every all the plant life like and and those people
2483580	2488220	Are even saying at this point. It's the only practical alternative to like, uh,
2488620	2491980	What could actually be a really serious human impacting thing?
2492060	2497340	So it's like it's it they're you know, the the story compares it to to the decision to do chemo
2497660	2499660	like where you're just like i'm just gonna
2500780	2505040	Attack myself with like something that kills everything
2505420	2510620	And maybe won't kill me as much as it kills this thing because like the feral pig problem is like that real
2511420	2513420	crazy
2514540	2517820	This has been me recapping a podcast you should listen to
2519100	2521100	Now you don't have to listen to that episode
2521340	2524060	It's our new segment called mobile pork units
2525660	2529420	Some people I see I wrote it down so I could remember some people cody at one point said, you know
2529900	2533980	We drink too much lacroix and like it's got like insecticide in it or something
2534300	2536300	That sounds like fucking garbage talk
2536860	2543100	What is it? It's like flavored with oil essential oil citrus things or something and everything that has citrus in it
2543660	2545660	Pesticides in it, I guess. I don't know
2545980	2548700	So it's like I think i'm drinking 12 cans of water
2549180	2555020	But really i'm drinking 12 cans of water with a little pesticide in it big deal. You got to get it somewhere bfd
2556380	2558380	You got to get your pesticides something. Yeah
2559180	2564540	Can I get a lacroix out here? I got a craving like I just i'm addicted to lacroix. Well flavors you like it
2564700	2567020	I like them all notion on that lime
2567580	2569020	Yeah, I mean I like lime
2569020	2573980	I don't want I don't want to pick a favorite flavor of lacroix because i'm afraid then i'll be like oh berry
2575100	2577100	You know
2581660	2586940	Passion fruit man, what even is a passion fruit? It's me
2589260	2591980	Oh, no memory sprite he checked his notes
2593900	2595900	Those notes the notes came in handy
2596860	2598860	Mm-hmm feral hogs
2600140	2602460	feral hogs, I like when uh
2603160	2608140	environmentally, there's a pest that was brought in by accident like uh
2609580	2612060	like the spanish brought in like hogs or like
2614860	2619340	And they terrorize the countryside they go oh what you do is you bring in a bunch of snakes
2620140	2625020	And the snakes go fucking crazy and start killing everything and then you go, you know what you need
2625900	2628940	Condors and then then the condors are supposed to kill the snakes
2629020	2631980	But the condors sleep at night when the snakes are out killing everybody
2632300	2637260	And like like and then you have to go then you have to get a bunch of hunters to go kill the condors
2637260	2642460	Because they're eating every fucking everything else. Yeah, I like when people just don't think ahead and
2643340	2645340	Everything's just gone to shit
2645660	2647740	I like that. Yeah, I love that
2648300	2652540	like uh, what's the one like they're like in Australia or New Zealand and
2653500	2655500	Cane toads toads, yeah
2656220	2661740	And then then they brought in like a marsupial like like like a fucking something to go eat them
2661740	2663740	But like no, but they're nocturnal
2664460	2667100	So while while one's asleep the other one's awake
2668300	2670300	Now everything's fucked
2670620	2672940	Can you imagine what it takes you gotta bring in Richard Attenborough?
2673660	2675660	Everything's fucked now
2676300	2678300	Imagine what it takes to to
2678760	2680760	destabilize the australian biosphere
2681320	2688520	Like like where 70 percent of everything is a poison spider. Also, uh, they don't even know what a knife is
2692840	2699560	I mean some people do but I would think you could introduce anything from the world to the australian biosphere and it would bounce
2699640	2701640	Off like a ping pong ball
2701720	2703960	Like oh, no, I can't there's poison spiders here. Blah
2703960	2705240	Hey
2705240	2709800	Like I like like but no some some fucking toad like is wreaking havoc
2709960	2715320	I think it's like the opposite where they have they have several problems caused by several invasive species
2715400	2721240	And it's like every one of those just really hit the ground running and now because like the galapagos like they're like a macro
2721480	2727160	Galapagos where it's like they're so isolated that they have key and tumbler kind of like uh evolution going
2727720	2729720	marsupials case in point
2729880	2736200	The fucking giant rats with human biceps that like knock on your patio door
2737240	2742600	God damn those youtube videos. Yeah, that's boy. Get get the fuck out of here. Get out of here
2743480	2745480	Get the fuck out. What the fuck?
2748760	2751560	Fucking like seven foot fucking rat monsters
2752200	2756600	That are just like banging on their glasses. Like if you type it into youtube, there's just like seven videos
2756600	2761000	And it's just like everyone just reacts the same way. They're like, ah you again. Get the fuck out of here
2761400	2763400	Get out of here. I'm sick and tired
2764600	2767000	You're sick and tired of fucking penny wise
2768280	2775720	That's fucking great. You get this guy's got spiders that crawl up the wall with birds in their mouths. It it it's unfair dinkum

3101840	3106640	So it's not like clerk can't like with half a cape on I see you just
3107200	3114800	You let it really just go and you like you be like, uh, leo sair or gabe caplin. Yeah big ass. Let it start dreading up
3115600	3117600	Yes, that's a leo sair reference
3117760	3123440	Thank you. Nobody. How does that how does that how do dreadlocks work? How do how do you get dreadlocks?
3123520	3128400	I don't know. Isn't it? Is there a technique or is it just like a natural thing that happens? It's a technique
3129920	3131920	You put mud and stuff
3132160	3134960	I say I have a photo of me with dreadlocks in high school
3135040	3140800	Why i'm just a white dude with dreadlocks and that's not cool. Well, okay, so then you know, how you get how do you do it?
3140880	3146160	Uh salt water like I was like a bodyboarder and so just sand and salt and neglect
3146240	3151280	So it just happened naturally. Yeah, but also like I my hair gets long. I have nervous energy
3151360	3152800	So I I bite my nails
3152800	3155280	But also like i'm constantly twisting my hair when it gets long
3155360	3155760	Okay
3155760	3160160	So when it's got salt and sand and it it just wants to kind of knot up a little, you know, okay
3160560	3164720	But it's so something you kind of halfway you're sort of like I think i'll do this now
3164960	3168320	Like you're like i'm doing this anyway, and then you just did this a lot. Don't do it
3169360	3171840	I didn't say I was gonna do it. I was just curious about how it works
3172240	3174960	Are we actually don't do it get dreadlocks
3176960	3180800	What if what if that was your weird midlife crisis where you said fuck it
3181280	3185920	I got one dragon. I probably got six months left for dreadlocks being possible
3186000	3191360	I guess I that would be a practical thing to do also your midlife crisis. What are you gonna be a fucking hundred?
3192880	3195360	Yeah, exactly. Yeah, okay. You you could do it
3195360	3198800	But your midlife crisis choices have to start like right now. Yeah
3199440	3201440	Uh, yeah, but dreadlocks will be fun for you
3202320	3204240	Yeah
3204240	3208000	You're you're in the pool all the time. You have a workout thing on your instagram
3208480	3213360	Kind of complicated relationship with my hair because it's it's it's it's going away and i'm like, I never liked you
3214000	3216080	But like like come back
3217440	3222960	Wait, are you are you getting bald or just just kind of gradually I'm definitely like it's that's all going away
3223040	3225120	Yeah, do you have the male pattern thing on the back? Yeah
3225840	3227200	Yeah
3227200	3230640	But a beautiful beard. Thank you. Your beard is luscious
3231360	3234800	It's like a like like the rivers of the orinoco. Yeah
3235600	3241760	Beards are just pubic hair in your face. I mean, it's like oh he grew he can grow a beard. Well, yeah, he's dying
3242320	3246960	You know, I can't grow a beard. I i've never had a good beard. I I I have facial hair
3247440	3250960	But it's patchy and like I looked like johnny depp on a bad weekend
3252880	3254880	Are we actually playing dnd
3256480	3257840	Spencer what you got?
3257840	3261600	Uh, uh, do we have that song we play it or it's not a song but it is

3266560	3267920	the town of
3267920	3274480	You found the town of ponos donos the farming village. There's about it's not much of a farming village
3274480	3278480	There's like six farms and there's only there's only a handful of people
3278800	3280080	You haven't really met them
3280080	3284560	You just kind of you rolled up on a farm you killed a fucking ghost that was haunting the farm
3284880	3288640	And then you're like, well i'm gonna i'm gonna take this farm now potato basket
3289360	3294480	Does this seem kind of diminishing like we used to be fighters and you had like ambitions
3294640	3297600	Look me in the eye and say that you're happy right now. I can't tell you that
3298400	3301040	There's one rival farmer ketamine
3302960	3307680	All right, we should make friends with her and learn to farm okay, we hear knock at the door. Yeah
3308080	3313120	It's a raccoon man. Glad you're settling him. Uh, you do owe a lot of money for this property
3313280	3319680	I hear fire that tree is on fire and arguing about that wraith is a is a woman who looks like a druid
3319840	3323360	And she's yelling at a small mole. I uh, I go. Hey, uh,
3324240	3328240	What's what's the beef you want to take care of this mole get him off my back? All right
3328320	3334160	Well, I think I can settle this. This is our property the moles piston leaves. Do you know about the church of corallax?
3334400	3339280	I'm a worshipper. I want to like i'll do anything other than just fucking grow up a table
3343120	3345120	We
3351040	3355040	Why do we become farmers we should become musicians i'm willing to give that a try
3355280	3361200	We'll go down to the town and we'll we'll see if there's music jobs. That's a story
3362560	3364560	I'm so inspired
3364560	3366560	Oh
3368400	3370400	Baby sure
3371360	3373360	Baby sure
3374240	3376240	That didn't help me at all
3376960	3378000	It's
3378000	3380640	I'm more confused than I was before that plane
3381200	3385840	It jacked it jacked some memories for me. I we were we were living on a potato farm
3385840	3388240	I thought I think I had a stroke and we were about to
3388640	3392640	We were gonna go to town and see if there were any music jobs. Yeah

4310400	4316080	I punch holes in the floorboards with my fists. Holy shit. I can see your resolve
4316640	4318960	Someone's talking about a baba yaga somewhere
4320960	4326080	Man, I just watched john wick three that movie was good. I liked it. I haven't seen my friend didn't like it
4326160	4329840	But i've never seen any john wicks. The first one's good. The second one's less good
4330800	4336000	Third one's good. Third one's good. Really? What's the premise? What what is a john wick? What does what does he do?
4336240	4339200	Well, he tries to get out but they keep pulling them back in right?
4341680	4347360	The first one introduces you to the idea that there's a john wick and the second one is like
4347760	4351040	Of course, there's lots of john wicks and like john wick
4351520	4356560	There's like hotels where you can stay if you're a john wick. Is he a spy? Is he a superpower? He's an assassin
4357120	4361440	There's a whole like it's just it's just sort of like a there's a there's an eighth great boy
4361920	4363520	like realm
4363520	4370000	To the universe where everyone's an assassin your waiter's an assassin the people he's waiting on are assassins
4370080	4372960	They only don't assassinate each other because no one's paying them to
4373360	4377540	And there's some code when you're staying at the wall door of a story and you're not allowed to assassinate
4378000	4384640	John wick does anyway because you really want someone dead and then uh elsewhere engine is like did you realize what you've done?
4385440	4391760	God damn it. If we do a john wick 3 you're gonna fight the world and then everyone in new york like looks at them
4391760	4393760	And they're all like assassins
4394080	4400080	And I swear to god that's how john wick 2 ends with john wick like like like like uh elsewhere engine from from
4400480	4405680	ian mcshane it goes uh, he goes he goes i'll give you a 10 second head start
4406160	4411840	And like and then john wick starts like walking and the like the fight like like as the credits are going to start rolling
4411920	4416800	It's like this music is swelling as keanu reeves is walking past everyone in new york
4416880	4422080	And there's like a guy in a cowboy hat with an eye patch like looking at him and talking into his cuff
4422400	4427200	And then there's like an old woman with a dog and the dog's eyes roll back and two guns come out
4427200	4429200	and it's like
4430560	4432560	It's like this music is building like
4435280	4438880	It's like john wick 3 is either never gonna get shot or
4439520	4446800	That movie is gonna be fucking insane. Like because the second one was I want to use the word retarded but like
4447680	4452240	Yeah, am I really I don't know like I honestly think retarded people would be like that's fine
4453120	4459360	Well, they'd be like I don't because I don't know what other word like applies and my sister's retarded so
4460640	4463680	like and she I think if she saw john wick she'd be like
4465120	4466800	Yeah, that's
4466800	4468800	retarded
4468800	4475760	I really do because at one point he goes to a guy named the sommelier who you you get your weapons from this guy a sommelier
4476000	4478000	Yeah, his his gimmick is
4478640	4481360	He he talks about weapons like he's a waiter
4481920	4487520	Um, like so he goes like would you like something like something to go with the fish, but he's like holding a gun
4488400	4494320	And but but here's the crazy thing. There's no one else around and there's nothing but guns everywhere
4494480	4498160	So there's no point in using a code and then he says like guy you go to
4498400	4501120	He just refer to everything. It was like he takes out a hugo
4501200	4504320	And how about some pineapple for dessert and it's like a hand grenade
4504320	4510640	I'm like, why is he making this harder than it has to but it's it goes both ways because he's like i'm gonna need something
4510800	4516320	For an after dinner jacket or something and then he pulls out a gun and he's like, this is a glock p22 or whatever
4516560	4523440	It's like you said you say what type of gun this is and then you go back into weird, uh, like assassin creed
4524000	4527840	And everybody pays each other with like these weird sand dollars from ancient
4529200	4533360	Gaelic stonehenge that have needles in them when you like close them on your palm
4533360	4538560	So you have got a little john wick blood in a sundial and that means that you work for someone and
4539520	4542800	These are good movies or i like the first well, did you like the first one?
4543120	4549040	I like the I I like the first one as much as everybody else did and I I honestly I watched the second one by myself
4549680	4551680	And I was like look
4552000	4557120	At least this movie ain't lying to itself. Yeah, I watched the first one. I was like, this is like
4557680	4561680	Maybe a perfect movie. Like this is so good. And then the second one I was like
4562320	4564320	This is not what I wanted
4564640	4568880	I watched them back to back and it was a real bummer. I'm gonna be on a lot of uh planes coming up and I
4569200	4573040	Should I watch number one? Yes, I'd say watch all of them and skip number two or do it
4573040	4574400	I almost feel like you don't like watch it
4574400	4577040	I like I almost I kind of like number two more than number one
4577040	4581040	I feel like number one took itself a little too seriously given what all it was was just
4581680	4583440	Shooting a million people in the head
4583440	4584000	Yeah
4584000	4590000	And like this walking dead cg blood coming out and like I I was like like the whole movie
4590640	4596160	Is just like they they they they do him wrong in the beginning because they don't know he's john wick and then
4596640	4602320	Like the only threshold is that the bad guy in the movie that's older
4602960	4604960	Says to his son you did what?
4605600	4607360	to who
4607360	4609360	You know who this guy is
4609520	4611360	He's john wick
4611360	4613360	We used to call him
4613840	4615840	the wick
4615840	4618240	You know why he's never lit
4619200	4621200	But once he is
4621840	4623840	No, mosquitoes come around
4624640	4628400	Whatever, but it's like his son's like, I don't fucking care. I'm on cocaine. I don't care
4628400	4631200	Let him come and he's like you won't see him coming
4631360	4636160	And then there's no conflict the rest of the movie is just Keanu reeves going from fucking place to place
4636160	4639760	It's just like people are like hey, that's far enough. Let me frisk you
4640320	4642320	Okay
4642800	4644800	Oh
4648320	4655200	And then like the last guy of like a hundred guys in that warehouse it's like where is the next building full of people
4655600	4658080	And he's like it's it's a block away. It's
4658720	4661120	It's a bath house. It's a bath house
4661600	4663920	And then he's like thanks shoots him in the head
4664240	4669940	And then he cuts to like a greek guy going like i'm telling you anyways to continue my conversation
4670580	4672580	You don't know who this guy is
4672980	4676900	And then it cuts to fucking bath house. I swear that's the whole fucking movie
4677060	4679460	So the whole the whole movie is act two
4679700	4680180	Yes
4680180	4685700	And then and then and then and then like the the bad guy is just like his dad yelled at him enough where he
4685860	4691140	He gets it that that's the other thing is like he's not like walking phoenix in gladiator where he's like fuck you old man
4691460	4695380	I'll do it. You know, like i'm he's like the guy the kid is like, okay
4695460	4699620	It sounds like I fucked up also the dad's like john wick's like really hard to kill and he's gonna come kill me
4699700	4705460	And so the kid just like sits in a fucking ninth warehouse and he's just like there waiting. What are the stakes?
4706580	4711060	How do you take john wick down or you kill him? You just don't you don't obviously you don't
4711860	4714420	Shoot you in the head and then yeah, he just shoots everyone in the head
4715220	4719860	and then john wick says that's why I like john wick to a little better because at least it's like
4720740	4724820	The movie seems to agree a little bit more that everything is like as I said
4724820	4727860	although I won't keep using the word it starts with an r but like
4728740	4734100	It just seems like the like the movie and you are on the same page for john wick too where it's like, yeah
4734340	4736340	Yeah, it beats government work
4737060	4739060	All right, I watching the movie
4741540	4747220	What if i'm on a plane and I I want to just start with number three, is that a bad idea I think it's a great idea
4748180	4750900	I mean you could do it, but I think it's yeah, I don't know
4752020	4758660	He does a lot of stuff that doesn't quite make sense. If you don't know what's happening. I I asked the the writer's assistant on
4760500	4763380	rick and morty went a couple months ago, uh
4764180	4765940	He said I saw john wick through it
4765940	4770820	I said so they do they make good on the promises of john wick too or this is just like
4771300	4775780	The whole world's an assassin and he's like, yeah, I I don't know who makes their food
4778180	4780180	Right, which is what I wanted to hear
4781860	4787460	You can't get an uber like it's just everyone's yeah. Oh, you can get an uber but it'll be the uber
4788900	4791940	Mmm, I make a five stars
4797300	4804420	Well, I recommend you drop me off before my destination oh clever
4808100	4810100	What was the story, uh
4810100	4812100	It stopped me if I told it before about
4812580	4815940	Peter O'Toole's being interviewed and he had done a film with Keanu Reeves
4816820	4819380	and uh and someone at the interviewer said like
4819940	4822500	What was it like working with them and he goes well kenu?
4823860	4826660	And and the interview guy says it's keon and he goes
4827380	4829960	Yes, but one gets the idea
4829960	4831960	Yeah
4835000	4837320	Like I I don't care how you say it
4840680	4847000	Peter O'Toole one gets the idea. All right one gets the idea. I mean
4849720	4852200	That's so awesomely dismissive that's great
4854440	4857480	All right, so are we back at the farm I mean
4858440	4862680	Oh, yeah, sure. I was like plenty of talking on the way. Can we retrieve our weapons now?
4862680	4867880	We're back at the crib, right? Yeah. Oh wait. I punch you punch open the floor boards. There's weapons
4867880	4869560	Can we do the gag where he's punching?
4869560	4874360	He punches through the floor and it's like all the music's mounting and then and then in the background of the shot
4874360	4877080	I'm opening a cabinet and that's all and then I hand him his stuff
4879720	4885320	Well, then what's in the floorboards right that's the joke no, I know what is oh, it's just it's my it's my uh,
4886280	4892760	So church of the silver flame chain mail. Oh, well, yeah, okay. Well, then that's right. Yeah
4894680	4899080	Don't I have like a staff like a chalalie kind of yeah, I think you got a chalalie
4899080	4904760	Yeah, I and that cast magical Donna chalalie. I I just get that and whatever
4905160	4909160	My knapsack holds in terms of you know food and tools and whatnot
4909160	4913800	Yep, you get those you might have a knife too. But yeah, you usually just shoot fire
4913880	4917400	I think I guess the joke one version of the joke. I'm not really a joke writer, but
4918600	4920600	Like he's paying he punches through the floor
4920680	4924680	He's just there's all this punching through the floor and the music suggests that there's gonna be something under there and then I
4924840	4929560	and then I I open a cabinet and I hand him a bundle of his stuff and he looks at it and he's like
4930520	4931560	um
4931560	4934520	I thought I thought you were gonna put it under the floorboards
4935400	4936840	And I'm like
4936840	4938840	Why why would I do that?
4940120	4941720	Like
4941800	4945080	Like what a horrible way to store things
4945640	4947160	Here's another another pitch
4947160	4952120	What like while he's punching holes in the floor and you you carlos and I don't understand why he's doing that
4952600	4957240	We get our weapons out and including his right that we keep him in our weapon cabinet, right?
4957240	4960040	Yeah, and and then we walk over to him and we hand him
4960760	4963160	wood and tools to repair the floor
4964840	4968600	But he broke for no reason yeah, what if what if that's what's out of our security
4969160	4972760	Yeah, he pulls like hammers and nails in all these plants
4974920	4976920	He puts them back
4978360	4982120	That's way better than what he reaches in and pulls out wait
4983000	4985400	He goes, okay. Here's here's here. Here it is
4985960	4990040	This is a little lateral but like he he he punches through the floorboards
4990520	4993160	And then so far it's been so straightforward while he's doing it
4993880	4998280	I open up the cabinet and I pull out like three bundles of stuff in the third bundle
4998280	5001480	I put in front of him and he's like he's just finished like punching
5002120	5005480	Through the it took a while to break through and as he finishes
5006120	5008600	I put the his stuff in front of him. He goes. What's that? I go
5008600	5013560	It's your stuff and he goes what's down here and he reaches down and pulls up
5014600	5016600	Lumber and nails. Yeah, okay
5017480	5019240	You fucking
5019240	5024760	Stuff that you're gonna use to fix the floor. Yeah. Okay. I think I think we got that joke locked down this one
5027880	5030680	What what do you I don't know what do you guys think I think you saved the picture
5032360	5033480	This one's way worse
5033480	5038440	But just to say like he he opens up he opens up the floor and he pulls out a box
5038440	5040680	And there's all these like golden assassin coins in it
5040680	5045800	And then you you put down the weapons and then steve like puts the coin in like a quarter machine and bubblegum comes out
5045800	5047800	And he just chews it
5048600	5051240	And it's like he was just doing that he was just trying to get some gum
5052520	5054520	I said it was worse
5054920	5056920	But I think it's better than yours
5057960	5063800	Or like he punches the floor and then what he pulls out is a book that says like dealing with stress
5066200	5068200	Anger management
5070680	5077080	Wait don't don't wrap your hands don't we have uh cows to kill what are we doing? Yeah pigs pigs hogs
5077720	5080920	He punches through the floor and then he pulls out a he he
5082280	5086840	He pulls out a book that says anger management and he goes like
5088120	5092680	And we pull out a book from the cabinet that says carpentry and we're like
5099560	5101800	But also down there there's a book that says how to kill
5102520	5104360	Feral hugs. Oh, yeah
5104440	5107480	That we didn't know was there we go. Okay, let's let's read that
5107960	5111640	On our way back to the village and kill kill some feral hogs
5111960	5114920	We're not going back to the village right the mat. What does the map take us?
5115160	5120040	Yeah, it's nearby the village, but we're going to the tree house. All right, we're suiting up. I'm putting on my rope belt
5120200	5122200	Uh, uh, my burlap robe
5122840	5125480	Um, and my clerical, uh cudgel
5127400	5132220	I'm doing the uh silver flame five-pointed genuflect
5133180	5134380	um
5134380	5140700	And doing the kind of our uh, all hail your glimmering majesty me your oxygen rich flame
5141580	5148700	Uh burn eternally throughout the atmosphere. May you purify those with your heat that cannot be purified by shadow. Amen
5150380	5153100	I go down and explore the hole that diarrhea jr made
5154380	5156380	There's lumber and nails and stuff. Okay
5157100	5161500	Oh, I come back up you do that. You're not laughing. Why aren't you laughing?
5162060	5164860	Spencer up and she was down there. It wasn't funny
5167260	5174460	I I do take just because I I have a spare pocket. I I take a couple nails just in case because uh,
5175420	5178380	Any adventure that goes into a dangerous situation?
5179020	5182300	If you get disarmed you won't have something in your pocket that you could use as a weapon
5182300	5187100	You never know when you have to home alone. Exactly. I might I might have to mccollie call him some uh,
5187740	5189740	some joe pejes
5190700	5197180	And i'm like, hey, hey, those are for the joke. All right. Well, the joke the jokes the joke landed
5197740	5200700	The joke, I think we nailed that joke. Oh
5201980	5203980	Yeah
5204620	5206620	Oh
5214140	5221500	Maybe we should uh, maybe we should open the cellar and let all of these kormic mccarthy the road. Uh, uh, cannibal
5224620	5226620	People out of the basement
5227580	5231980	It's these cannibal victims it just sounded like I don't know they're like groaning
5232060	5234620	I just was imagining if it was we already nailed the joke
5235500	5239020	We have a we have a pit of people that are like amputees down there
5239980	5244380	The funny thing is I didn't mean that pun that was totally accidental. I did not intend that at all
5245100	5249980	All right, uh back to the uh to the to the people in the hogs you do that
5250300	5253660	Wait, I wanted to I I threw a couple lumbers in my bag
5254620	5256620	Okay for later
5256860	5259740	And I suited up i'm suited up like a like a fucking avenger
5260780	5264540	You got your stuff and it's like two six foot long planks
5265980	5267980	Yeah, let's fucking go
5268780	5274220	It's good. All right off to the tree off to the tree to kill some feral hogs
5274460	5278460	Well, i'll bring my he's brought nails and you're bringing i'll bring him a hammer
5278940	5282540	Just wait till you see I got a plan for these fucking points. Okay, so we're going back to it
5283100	5284220	so
5284220	5290460	Kagura, what's her name? Kagura Kagura her tree is being infested by ghostly feral hogs not ghostly
5290460	5292540	Just feral just regular feral hogs. Oh
5293020	5297260	They're yeah, they're extraordinary. All right, so you just like level one, huh guys?
5297980	5300060	Remember just like level one
5302220	5305660	Killing hogs how many hogs can we collect, you know, yeah
5306540	5308540	How about some hog toenails?
5309020	5314860	This feels good. All right. Okay. Wow, we arrive at the tree. I hope yeah you get to the tree
5315100	5318460	It's in a clearing like there's there's not trees right nearby
5318540	5325020	It's kind of like standing alone like creating its own space and there's all these trees you see tons of scratch marks on the tree
5325660	5329100	From you know pigs maybe and up at the top of the tree
5329180	5332460	You can see it goes up real high and you can't see where kagura is
5332540	5337820	But when you get there a bunch of mouths appear on the tree like around the perimeter and they say oh you're here
5337900	5342300	What's up? Check down there. There's the potato but the grenades. Oh cool
5342460	5344940	There's four or five whatever I said a bunch of what's up here
5345580	5353420	Mouths on the on the tree as if by magic like a harry potter kind of thing more or less morden kenan's uncanny intercom system
5353500	5360380	Gotcha magic mouth. I take a couple grenades potato grenades. You do that you take all of them. Oh boy

5380380	5383820	There's produce flame and then you have another that lets you throw three flames
5383900	5389100	Then you have another one that lets you just shoot like a fire beam of some sort. I choose the uh,
5389260	5395740	I like I produce fire you do that you're producing two fires. You're holding fires like the human torch, right?
5397020	5399900	I'm ready. I have my sword out ready to fight
5400620	5403660	All right, heavenly flame be silver among my reflective
5404380	5409020	Sins that we do and they get us make the shadows perish in front of your holy light

5415020	5417020	We're ready. All right
5417020	5422860	The the mouths on the on the tree start winking madly. How did they're winking? What does it sound like? Oink?
5423500	5425500	Oink
5427820	5429820	Like that, okay
5430940	5432940	That tracks yeah
5433020	5438700	A bunch of pigs come charging through like uh, not a bunch the first wave of pigs. It says wave one
5439020	5445180	There's five pigs I pull the pin on my first potato grenade and I throw it toward the pigs you do that

5582380	5586620	Uh, no, they just their their tough skin gets charred and it smells like bacon
5586620	5589580	Actually, they each take seven damage because you hit one fire at each of them
5590700	5597580	And one of them doesn't get hit but then the pigs they kind of uh rear up on two legs and you can see in their stomach
5597580	5603340	There's a giant toothy maw and then they kind of bend over backwards all weird horror style
5603420	5610700	So the ma is like up like uh, like a snapping mouth and they're kind of like twisted backwards like body horror shit
5613500	5618860	God damn it. We got we got fucking we got some 1985 the thing pigs. We're up carlos

5642840	5644700	righteous circle
5644700	5646700	around my compatriots
5647020	5651660	Buffing their combat skills and increasing their confidence. All right
5653420	5654620	You
5654620	5658380	You consecrate the area for our listeners who didn't see that
5658700	5662140	Dan just put his glasses on while he said that like in a very
5662920	5666860	Nonchalant kind of groovy professorial way that happens
5667980	5669980	the pigs attack
5670460	5672860	They god fuck they miss they all miss
5673500	5675100	Why are you mad?
5675100	5677020	Why are you on their side?
5677020	5682140	It's just sad when nothing happens, you know, um, they bite at you with their big jaws
5682220	5685500	But I guess even though this is potentially their true form
5685500	5691180	They're not really agile and you find it easy to dodge out of their snapping mouths. Hmm. Damn carlos
5691180	5696460	I'm feeling so confident right now. I'm feeling really really hot. I'm some hot diarrhea right now
5699820	5701900	I'm so hot
5701900	5705100	I pull out another potato grenade. I unpin it and I
5705820	5710940	Attempt to throw it directly into the underbelly mouth. All right, just full of confidence
5711660	5713660	Oh boy, you miss
5715180	5718540	You hit behind them and they only take half damage which is six
5719820	5721820	Okay

5840300	5842940	You hit it with your sword and then your shield
5844780	5849260	Uh, the sword hits the shield doesn't do damage because it's like a shield you smack it
5849260	5853980	But it doesn't seem very bothered by it. But your sword hits the other one for
5855020	5857020	three six damage
5857020	5863260	Three six. No six six damage. It takes six damage and it's fine. It's like I love this
