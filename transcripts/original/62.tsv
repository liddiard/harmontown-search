0	19820	Good evening, Hollywood, California.
19820	20820	What goes down tonight?
20820	21820	I'll tell you what goes down.
21820	22820	Hermit Town is now in session.
22820	35460	Here we are at the Meltdown, Sturtis, Melting Meltdown Theater here in Hollywood, California.
35460	36460	I'm Jeff Davis, your Comptroller.
36460	41460	Let's welcome to the stage the mayor of Hermit Town, Mr. Dan Hermit.
41460	58580	Couple of lazy, lazy, crowdy kicks I did there for you listening at home.
58580	59860	Thank you for coming to Hermit Town.
59860	61380	Thank you, Jeff Davis, our Comptroller.
61380	64380	What a wonderful job he does.
64380	66380	All right.
66380	69940	Well, I got nothing.
69940	71340	I don't have anything to talk about tonight.
71340	72340	That's our show.
72340	73340	Good night.
73340	74340	Thank you for coming, everybody.
74340	75340	We did the...
75340	76340	I'd like to thank...
76340	77340	Mo Fathlebap.
77340	86500	He's the best name you can thank.
86500	87500	It's the worst name.
87500	88500	I can never remember.
88500	91220	There's no mnemonic device for bathlefap.
91220	93540	You can never remember if it's B first or M first.
93540	95940	You can say Mo Fathlebap wrong and nobody knows.
95940	96940	Oh, that's it.
96940	97940	Okay.
97940	98940	Fathlebap.
98940	99940	Fathlebap.
99940	104460	It's going to be a bad show tonight, folks.
104460	105460	Buckle up and...
105460	109780	Mo came out of the corner and heard it.
109780	114820	We said it three times wrong, so he's like an insecure Beetlejuice.
114820	118620	Fathlebap, bathlebap, bathlebap.
118620	123540	And he's like, I think you might mean me.
123540	124540	Let me help you.
124540	126780	I've been doing this my whole life.
127620	133300	Anyways, yeah, I was nursing a well-earned hangover all day today.
133300	139940	We watched like four movies in bed, Aaron and I and Jeff.
139940	141980	Because we did the Channel 101 roast last night.
141980	144500	There's a 10-year anniversary at Channel 101.
144500	149940	Some of you may not be familiar with Channel 101, but it's been around for 10 years now.
149940	151220	It's 10 years old.
151220	155540	I gave birth to something 10 years old.
156460	159300	You gave birth to something zero years old, and now it's 10.
159300	164340	It's going to be a bad show, folks.
164340	165340	People correcting each other.
165340	168940	Do your baby back rib rib one more time.
168940	170860	I stopped short because I was like, what are you doing?
170860	173300	I'm going to do...
173300	174300	Here, watch this.
174300	175300	What's your name, ma'am?
175300	176300	Samantha.
176300	177300	Got Samantha?
177300	180580	It's like Got Milk.
180580	181580	That's it.
181580	182580	That's all you get tonight.
183580	187580	So just mid-90s advertising slogan for that.
187580	188580	Yeah.
192580	195580	Oh, dear heavens, pull it together.
195580	197580	It's partly your job, though, isn't it?
197580	199580	My favorite part of the roast last night...
199580	202580	I mean, I can't imagine many people that are here were there last night.
202580	204580	But one guy.
204580	206580	Adam Goldberg.
206580	209580	At some point, we were all roasting each other.
209580	211580	It's friends roasting each other, so that's what a roast should be.
211580	215580	So good-natured, fake vitriol and spleen.
215580	219580	And there was a gal in the audience who kept just going...
219580	223580	Just ejaculations for no reason in the middle of the show.
223580	226580	And Dan got up last.
226580	229580	I was the roast master and brought Dan up for the finale.
229580	233580	And Dan stopped roasting friends and just lampooned...
233580	236580	No, not lambasted.
236580	239580	Assaulted a woman in the audience.
240580	243580	And it was that. It was for the benefit of all. It was fantastic.
243580	245580	So you missed that.
247580	249580	Let's do a new segment.
249580	251580	Do you have a song you can play a little sound by?
251580	253580	What sort of segment? Give me the tone of the segment.
253580	255580	This segment's called...
257580	259580	Ask Dan a Question.
270580	275580	Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Ask Dan a Question.
275580	279580	Where you, the audience, get to ask Dan Harmon a question.
279580	282580	A question? Yeah.
285580	287580	All right.
287580	289580	Good, good. Well, maybe...
289580	293580	Hey, if you got enjoyment out of that, maybe it won't be a bad show.
293580	298580	Maybe we accidentally assembled some people with very low standards tonight.
298580	300580	Everything will even right out.
300580	302580	Or I picked the perfect musical cue.
302580	304580	Oh, no. You did great.
306580	309580	Anybody have a question? Raise your hand.
309580	312580	Okay, let's go deeper first. What's your name, sir?
312580	315580	I'm Kyle. Kyle, what's your question?
315580	317580	How you doing?
317580	320580	The question to Dan is, from Kyle.
320580	322580	How are you doing?
322580	326580	I'm doing good. I was a little hungover.
329580	333580	Well, you asked a question.
335580	337580	I don't know. Yeah, okay.
337580	339580	All right, one more question. One more question.
339580	343580	Let's go in the back. I see the shadow of a hand.
344580	346580	Where did you get your hair cut? It looks great.
346580	349580	The question is, where did you get your hair cut?
349580	351580	Addendum. It looks great.
352580	354580	Chicago.
359580	361580	Next question.
363580	366580	All right, let's go with Beef Fungus Bell.
366580	368580	Beef Fungus Bell in the front row.
368580	371580	Is there any conceivable way Heat Vision and Jack could come back?
371580	373580	The question is to Dan Harmon,
373580	377580	is there any conceivable way that Heat Vision and Jack could come back?
384580	386580	That was too fast. I'm sorry.
387580	392580	I mean, that's been trying to happen for a really, really, really long time.
392580	396580	I just watched it. We screened it at the Austin Television Festival.
396580	401580	And I was stricken with the fact that, A, holy shit, we need to tighten those edits.
401580	406580	But B, I think it really just needs to be a movie, if anything.
406580	408580	I don't know. But then again,
408580	410580	Shrab had a really good idea for an animated series.
411580	417580	Every time that thing comes up and is going to get reborn in some way,
417580	420580	something complicated happens.
420580	423580	There's a lot of cooks in that kitchen,
423580	427580	a lot of people sharing that intellectual property.
430580	433580	Under the right circumstances, would you want it to come back?
433580	437580	Well, I think you could make a really, really good movie out of it.
438580	440580	I had a script that I wrote,
440580	442580	which I'm sure it's not the best script I've ever written,
442580	445580	but the idea behind the script,
445580	448580	I felt like going into doing a Heat Vision and Jack feature.
448580	453580	Heat Vision and Jack Kids is this thing I did in 1999 with Shrab,
453580	455580	Rob Shrab for Fox.
455580	457580	It was a pilot that didn't get picked up about Jack Black.
457580	459580	He's a super intelligent astronaut.
459580	461580	He's got too close to the sun, so his brain expanded.
461580	463580	He's running from NASA with his talking motorcycle,
463580	465580	voiced by Owen Wilson.
466580	469580	I always felt like if you did a movie version of it,
469580	472580	the movie version of it should be like...
472580	475580	Anybody ever see Wrestlers Rhapsody?
477580	480580	I wanted them to have a kind of meta quality to it,
480580	486580	where the sort of Knight Rider-y, hulky, atemian,
486580	492580	Buck Rogers-esque kind of fantasy quality to the lifestyle
492580	495580	that Jack and Heat Vision were caught in,
495580	497580	along with its episodic nature,
497580	500580	was sort of a metaphor for the Bachelor lifestyle
500580	502580	before one settles down.
502580	506580	You've got your one buddy who's never going to let you settle down,
506580	510580	a.k.a. a motorcycle that can't stand still or he falls down himself.
510580	513580	I'm sitting right here, Dan.
513580	515580	I hear it, Dan.
519580	522580	My version of the feature was going to be that Jack...
522580	525580	First, you just do 20 minutes of awesome.
525580	527580	Just do Heat Vision and Jack.
527580	530580	Just do an episode or two, just wing through him.
530580	535580	And then plot point one on page 20 is,
535580	538580	Jack, once again, for the 500th time,
538580	541580	or he's lost count, once again,
541580	544580	he goes into a small town and meets a nurse
544580	546580	or an aerobics instructor or something
546580	550580	and she's having trouble that indirectly leads to a supernatural adventure.
550580	553580	But this time, he goes home with her
553580	556580	and he's doing the same routine over and over again
556580	559580	with just cosmetic differences.
559580	564580	His life is templated and successful, syndicated, if you will.
564580	569580	And then the woman's roommate comes home
569580	575580	and it's a girl that Jack did this with five seasons ago.
575580	578580	And she's like, holy shit, she's completely changed.
578580	580580	She's going to medical school now.
580580	582580	She's become a real human being
582580	585580	and this person that she knew, had this dalliance with,
585580	590580	who came through her life, he hadn't changed at all.
590580	593580	And that that was Jack's real...
593580	597580	Seeing himself through her eyes as a creature of habit,
597580	602580	as a person whose life was going through these illogical patterns.
602580	604580	For instance, why are you running from NASA still?
604580	606580	Have you tried talking to them?
606580	612580	You know, when you find out that Bigfoot exists,
612580	616580	why don't you leverage that information to get people to stop chasing you?
616580	619580	Or just like, why do you bother fighting Bigfoot
619580	621580	when you're on the run from these people?
621580	624580	Can't you use that as an excuse?
624580	627580	He starts asking questions that you're not supposed to ask
627580	632580	and that sort of triggers their greatest adventure yet.
632580	634580	That's probably where it falls apart
634580	636580	and that's probably why they'll never get made.
636580	637580	I would really like to see that.
637580	639580	I could probably just do that and not call it Heat Vision and Jack.
639580	643580	I could call it Octopus Face and Sock Dick.
644580	655580	Octopus Face and Sock Dick, they're best friends to the loving end.
655580	660580	They're gonna go on some adventures and fight some Bigfoots too.
660580	663580	They're gonna do battle with a Loch Ness Monster,
663580	665580	fight a werewolf and eat some lobster.
665580	670580	They're gonna go down to the basement with you.
671580	680580	These characters are ready to assault you.
685580	691580	Retraining my brain did not go to certain comedic wells at 40.
691580	695580	That, if you're gonna do an improv song, that's an unforgiving tempo there too.
696580	699580	Hey man, my life's an unforgiving life.
703580	704580	You have a question, sir?
704580	709580	If you had to choose between sex or teleportation for the rest of your life, what would you choose?
709580	718580	The question is, if you had to choose between sex or teleportation for the rest of your life, which would you choose?
718580	722580	I mean, I would ask you your name, but your new name is Segment Saver.
726580	731580	Those other questions, that's amazing.
731580	734580	If only everyone wanted to know something like that.
734580	736580	Everyone could do a show.
736580	739580	If sex or teleportation for the rest of my life...
739580	742580	Meaning, if you chose teleportation, there could be no sex?
742580	746580	Yeah, you can't be pleasured sexually anymore, actually.
746580	748580	No more orgasms ever.
749580	756580	Will that raise my already rising risk of prostate cancer?
756580	759580	Because I know there's certain statistics about that.
759580	763580	If I don't orgasm five times a week, I enter some risk group.
763580	765580	Let's assume no.
765580	768580	Could you teleport back to a time when you could enjoy sex now, right?
768580	769580	It's telepor-
769580	771580	Dad!
771580	774580	How does it work, son?
774580	776580	Teleportation is-
777580	779580	Is it a time machine?
784580	787580	Will you come over and help me reset my teleportation machine?
787580	790580	It keeps blinking 12.
790580	792580	I love that it keeps blinking 12.
792580	798580	I was about to say that, too, and then realized that the reference to it, blinking 12, has become the new-
798580	800580	Baby back ribs.
800580	804580	It's the new way of recognizing an old person.
804580	810580	When we were 15, if your VCR was blinking 12, it meant you were 38, because you didn't know how to set it.
810580	815580	And now, if you make that reference, people know you're 40.
815580	817580	It's funny.
817580	823580	Our VCR reference is blinking 12.
823580	825580	Our comedy is blinking 12.
825580	827580	And nobody here knows how to reset it, because they don't know what it is.
827580	829580	Yeah, they're like...
829580	830580	Anyways-
830580	831580	Okay, so what are the telepor-
831580	832580	Teleportation or sex?
832580	835580	So, like, basically, you could teleport anywhere?
835580	837580	You could, I guess, hold someone and bring them with you?
837580	840580	You could teleport anywhere, bring somebody with you.
840580	841580	Or stuff, I guess.
841580	848580	So, I could teleport and find, like, really virile men to pleasure Aaron and bring them back to the bedroom.
848580	852580	And then teleport into the closet dressed as Superman and just watch.
853580	861580	I mean, you know, I guess without her, penis could still pleasure her, but there's that.
861580	863580	Well, that's a big thing, yeah, too.
863580	864580	Wait, what was that?
864580	867580	Well, because if I wasn't in a relationship, that would be...
867580	868580	I think that would be...
868580	874580	Teleportation at 40, like, is very tempting.
874580	877580	What comes to mind when you think of teleporting?
877580	878580	Like, to what?
878580	881580	Just go in places fast, motherfucker.
882580	884580	Instant travel, is it anywhere?
884580	885580	You hate travel.
885580	888580	Well, maybe because I don't have teleportation.
888580	889580	I don't know.
889580	891580	Well, I guess you bring up an interesting point, I guess.
891580	893580	Where would you go, Magellan?
895580	902580	Well, I mean, it would be like you could teleport to the inside of a bank vault, and it would be effective retirement.
903580	904580	Okay.
904580	905580	So you become jumper?
905580	907580	Yeah, you become jumper.
908580	913580	Yeah, but what's the point of having all the money in the world if you can't enjoy sex anymore?
913580	917580	I mean, this question is no longer a metaphor.
921580	924580	Are you at 40 years old still capable of enjoying sex?
924580	925580	Of course.
925580	930580	Well, according to my wiener, I come and stuff.
930580	931580	Yeah, yeah.
931580	933580	That's a good barometer.
934580	938580	But you'd rather give that up so you could rob banks?
938580	941580	Well, I'm weighing it.
942580	945580	You could just appear on a hammock in Tahiti and be there?
945580	955580	I'm trying to break it down by wondering how important is sex to me in terms of myself and how important is sex to me in terms of keeping Aaron.
956580	964580	If I thought that my ability to have an orgasm was the reason Aaron was going to stay with me forever, then there's also the children thing.
964580	966580	Like, I want to have a kid.
966580	967580	I can't do that.
967580	972580	Technically, I could teleport to Vienna and get a doctor to remove my sperm.
972580	974580	Or save it up before you choose.
974580	977580	Right. I mean, I'm assuming I get like a 36-hour...
979580	983580	I get to walk around like I had Norton and kind of say goodbye to everybody.
984580	985580	I'm everywhere.
987580	989580	So you know what's going to come to that party?
991580	995580	Dan's getting teleportation instead of sex on Monday.
995580	997580	He wants everyone to come to the Rainbow Room.
997580	999580	No, thank you.
999580	1009580	All right. So let's say in your 36-hour window where you've made this choice, you have a doctor from Sweden save your semen in case you ever want to have a child.
1009580	1013580	You've cleared it with Aaron and let her know that virile men will fuck her while you dress up in a costume.
1014580	1016580	She gives you the thumbs up on that.
1016580	1019580	She goes, I'll take that bullet.
1019580	1020580	I'll take that bullet.
1020580	1025580	Then, okay, so you've chosen never to enjoy an orgasm again, but now where are you going?
1025580	1026580	What's the...
1027580	1029580	What could possibly make that worthwhile?
1030580	1032580	I mean, definitely first Dublin.
1034580	1037580	Because the flight delays are killers.
1038580	1040580	I just pop over to Dublin.
1040580	1041580	I don't know. It's a really good question.
1041580	1045580	I know that there's a good way to use teleportation for a guy with a sedentary lifestyle.
1045580	1046580	For rescue?
1046580	1048580	Oh, rescue. Okay. All right.
1049580	1052580	He's right. You know what? That's another thing to consider.
1052580	1056580	If you get like jumper, don't you end up just getting...
1056580	1060580	If you have an extraordinary power, you end up getting eaten away by the responsibilities.
1060580	1062580	I mean, we all... Yeah, fuck that.
1063580	1067580	Every time you watch TV, every time there's a 9-11, you're like, fuck me.
1067580	1071580	I got to go teleport under rubble and bring people out.
1072580	1076580	Is teleportation always in the moment? There's no time to travel to it, right?
1076580	1078580	It's space, not time.
1078580	1080580	It's space, so you can just be somewhere right now.
1081580	1085580	So if you're watching 9-11 happen, what are you going to teleport to?
1085580	1087580	New York, you fucking...
1088580	1090580	Specifically where? In the building?
1091580	1093580	It's happening on the news.
1093580	1095580	Were you willing to come up here? Okay, come up here, please.
1095580	1097580	Because ask him.
1099580	1104580	He's the guy that's giving me teleportation or taking away my gonads.
1105580	1106580	What's your name, sir?
1106580	1107580	My name's Connor.
1107580	1109580	Connor? Okay. Have we met before?
1109580	1110580	No. Oh, okay.
1110580	1111580	All right.
1111580	1114580	Maybe when we teleported, but that's fine.
1114580	1117580	Or maybe, maybe, Harmontown fans are a type.
1118580	1120580	Todd Bishop.
1120580	1129580	Yeah, for you at home, he doesn't look like Russell Crowe.
1133580	1136580	You look like a young Frank Gorsham.
1136580	1138580	If I knew who that was, I'd probably agree with you.
1138580	1141580	He played the Riddler on the original Batman.
1141580	1143580	You're blinking 12, baby.
1144580	1146580	No, I said, you guys groan when I was...
1146580	1148580	He was a comic on a TV show.
1148580	1150580	Russell Crowe is a Visigoth.
1150580	1152580	He's a big, hairy, Ursine man.
1152580	1155580	I was saying, this guy's more on the Neil Patrick Harris end of the spectrum,
1155580	1156580	which is equally...
1156580	1160580	There's a lot of handsome men that don't look like Russell Crowe.
1160580	1165580	I think what we found out is that you guys give Russell Crowe a little too much leeway.
1166580	1168580	I refuse to feel bad about that.
1168580	1169580	I think...
1169580	1171580	Connor, would you like to talk about that?
1172580	1174580	Connor, would you like to go out to dinner sometime?
1174580	1176580	I mean, absolutely.
1176580	1177580	See?
1177580	1181580	All right, anyway, so in your mind, teleportation, if you did have it,
1181580	1183580	is this something you've thought about?
1183580	1186580	Yeah, this is actually weird that this got brought up tonight,
1186580	1189580	because freshman year of college, me and my best friends,
1189580	1191580	would debate over this.
1191580	1193580	And people have...
1193580	1197580	Most people at first were teleportation back when it was freshman year of college,
1197580	1199580	but a lot of people have swayed.
1199580	1200580	Wait, you're kidding.
1200580	1205580	When you were a freshman in college and you could drive nails through boards with your dick,
1205580	1206580	that's when...
1206580	1207580	Oh, because you're taking it for granted.
1207580	1209580	You're like, oh, I'd give this up for anything.
1209580	1210580	Oh, my dick's always so hard.
1210580	1211580	It gets in the way.
1211580	1213580	Can you believe that?
1213580	1215580	So give me a superpower instead.
1215580	1216580	I guess that makes sense.
1216580	1219580	And then when they turn 40, they're like, oh, my kingdom for a boner.
1223580	1224580	But you're not 40.
1224580	1225580	No.
1225580	1226580	You're 25.
1226580	1227580	Two.
1227580	1228580	22.
1228580	1229580	Not two.
1229580	1230580	All right.
1230580	1232580	Anyway, so that's already interesting.
1232580	1234580	But then once you think about it, I guess it makes sense.
1234580	1237580	These young, virile men would...
1237580	1238580	What about women?
1238580	1239580	Have you ever asked women this question?
1239580	1240580	Yeah.
1240580	1243580	Most girls, surprisingly, choose sex and more guys.
1243580	1246580	Well, now that we're not freshmen in college, most people are choosing sex.
1246580	1249580	But most girls, almost 90% of the time, it's sex.
1249580	1250580	Huh.
1250580	1251580	They all want it, huh?
1251580	1252580	Yeah.
1253580	1255580	It was one big plan.
1256580	1258580	Sex is the ultimate teleportation, man.
1261580	1265580	And when I want to go to another place, I just go to bed with Dan Harmon.
1267580	1269580	It kind of forces you to not want to be there.
1271580	1273580	It's like I'm in a bank vault right now.
1277580	1278580	Yeah.
1278580	1280580	Everyone that's been to bed with me knows what it's like to...
1280580	1281580	All right.
1281580	1282580	...to remote travel.
1282580	1286580	Let's say there was a point in your life when you would have chosen teleportation.
1286580	1287580	I mean, still choosing it.
1287580	1288580	Just still do.
1288580	1292580	Okay, so then explain to me what the benefits, what makes teleportation.
1292580	1294580	I want to know the rules of teleportation, too.
1294580	1299580	If I want to go to Madagascar, even though I've never been there and probably couldn't find it on a map.
1299580	1304580	See, I think we've gone back and forth on this and probably thought about it way too much.
1304580	1310580	But, I mean, it'd probably be more fun if you could just think it and go as opposed to having been there or seen it on TV.
1310580	1311580	Right.
1312580	1315580	You don't have to have been to Ground Zero to teleport there.
1315580	1316580	Right.
1316580	1317580	You can just go.
1317580	1320580	But do I have to kind of know what's on the East Coast of the United States?
1320580	1321580	Yeah.
1321580	1323580	You can just throw a dart and get close.
1323580	1324580	That'll work.
1324580	1325580	All right.
1326580	1332580	So you could see a national crisis happening on CNN and go there and help people.
1332580	1333580	Yeah, you could.
1333580	1335580	Is that the allure of teleportation?
1335580	1338580	Is the greater good that you would use this as a superpower?
1338580	1339580	I think that's part of it.
1339580	1340580	I think that's the price.
1340580	1341580	That's the price of admission.
1341580	1342580	Yeah.
1343580	1345580	You could also do a lot of really fun stuff.
1345580	1346580	Right.
1346580	1347580	Okay.
1347580	1351580	Now, give me, like, forget the, or include whatever.
1351580	1352580	Think small.
1352580	1353580	Yeah.
1353580	1363580	Like, you ever drive past the public museum at night and think, like, man, you know, me and my friends could just go in there with a six-pack and just look at a T-Rex and just hang out?
1363580	1364580	Like, you could...
1364580	1365580	Yeah.
1365580	1368580	Never fuck again, but I want to see that T-Rex so bad.
1369580	1371580	I mean, fuck seeing it in the daytime.
1371580	1372580	And not during business hours.
1372580	1373580	No, no.
1373580	1376580	I guess, and also, they probably have motion sensors, and so the cops would always be coming.
1376580	1378580	But then you could just get the heck out, right?
1378580	1379580	You could teleport right the fuck out.
1379580	1381580	Well, let me ask you this, Connor.
1381580	1383580	Can I teleport to the moon?
1383580	1385580	You could, but...
1385580	1386580	But you'd die.
1386580	1387580	You'd probably...
1387580	1389580	Well, I could get a spacesuit.
1390580	1392580	If you got a spacesuit, then I think this works.
1392580	1393580	Yeah.
1393580	1396580	And then teleport to the moon with, like, tanks of oxygen and start building a city.
1397580	1398580	I hate to...
1399580	1404580	I hate to be a killjoy, but let's say you teleport to NASA where there are spacesuits,
1404580	1406580	and let's say you find one that fits you.
1406580	1407580	Right.
1407580	1408580	It already exists.
1410580	1411580	You understand that...
1413580	1415580	That was not a fat joke.
1416580	1419580	I think 200 people disagree.
1420580	1422580	That's on them, Dan.
1423580	1424580	I'm saying rocket science.
1424580	1425580	That was a fat joke.
1425580	1429580	For instance, I'm just about six foot four inches.
1429580	1432580	I'm not gonna find me a spacesuit that fits me.
1432580	1433580	You think those things are custom made?
1433580	1434580	Fuck yeah!
1434580	1435580	And then also...
1436580	1437580	No, no, no, no.
1437580	1438580	Team Taylor fit?
1438580	1440580	No, you get them off the fucking rack.
1440580	1441580	No, I'm a...
1441580	1442580	Yeah, but you want...
1442580	1443580	You go to Neiman Marcus and you say, I'll take a...
1443580	1444580	What do we got?
1444580	1449580	But when you set these guys up in the spaceship, don't you want all of their suits to fit all
1449580	1450580	of them just in case?
1450580	1454580	I'm pretty sure Buzz Aldrin's suit was Buzz Aldrin's suit for, like, fit him like a glove.
1454580	1455580	But I bet...
1455580	1460580	They would be stupid to not let him be able to go, hey, like, Neil Armstrong has a peanut
1460580	1461580	allergy and he...
1461580	1462580	Yes, yes, I'm sure there's a leeway.
1462580	1467580	He dies halfway up and he lands on the button that makes the spaceship go to Venus instead
1467580	1468580	of the moon.
1468580	1476580	And then, like, Aldrin's suit gets all fucked up because, like, whenever Glenn Beck, I don't
1476580	1482580	know the name of another astronaut, like, he starts eating shit like a moth and he tears
1483580	1484580	a hole in...
1484580	1485580	Bottom line is, like, who's...
1485580	1486580	Houston...
1486580	1487580	Okay, all right, so let's say...
1487580	1488580	Okay.
1488580	1489580	What do we do?
1489580	1490580	The answer better be, okay, there's another space suit.
1490580	1491580	I will grant you...
1491580	1492580	Okay, how about this?
1492580	1493580	Let's say you roll...
1493580	1499580	You bowl a strike and you go in there and you have short Vince Vaughn's space suit in there
1499580	1501580	because he's a little chubby.
1501580	1503580	And you go, this is Goldilocks.
1503580	1506580	Like, this one fits perfectly and you try that on.
1506580	1509580	A team of people need to make sure that thing works.
1509580	1511580	Like, you can't just put that thing on and sustain you.
1511580	1512580	Yeah.
1512580	1513580	All right, you...
1513580	1516580	Like, again, I'm only asking these questions so I can find out whether...
1516580	1518580	All right, so I teleport to NASA.
1518580	1521580	I steal a space suit and you're going to give me this that they got one there.
1521580	1523580	That one fit suit just right.
1523580	1526580	Why don't you bring just both suits so it's not even an issue?
1526580	1527580	What do you mean?
1527580	1529580	Like, bring the non-fitted suit and then the fitted suit.
1529580	1531580	Well, let's say you had ten suits that were all perfect.
1531580	1536580	Let's say, like, you walk into a giant wardrobe full of space suits and you can just pull
1536580	1537580	them off the rack.
1537580	1538580	I'm a 42 long.
1538580	1539580	That's perfect.
1539580	1540580	You get right in there.
1540580	1541580	So you have the suit.
1541580	1542580	Now you need...
1542580	1544580	This is not something that can operate on its own.
1544580	1545580	You need help on this, right?
1545580	1547580	On a space suit on the moon.
1547580	1548580	If we're going to the moon...
1548580	1549580	I don't know, do you?
1549580	1552580	Well, I mean, you could certainly figure that shit out.
1552580	1554580	The hard part of getting to the moon is propulsion.
1554580	1560580	Well, also, to put an EVA suit on and a spacecraft, you need, like, two people to help you get in.
1560580	1561580	I will have lots of friends.
1561580	1562580	I believe the teleporter guy.
1562580	1563580	But they don't work for NASA.
1563580	1564580	They don't.
1564580	1567580	And a lot of those friends will be super hot chicks because they won't feel threatened
1567580	1569580	by me because I won't be able to...
1569580	1574580	I will have so many, like, fucking awesome, smart, hot women friends.
1574580	1576580	But they're going to be turned on by the fact that you're going to go murder yourself on
1576580	1580580	the moon because you don't know how to operate a fucking space suit.
1580580	1581580	I don't understand.
1581580	1584580	Well, I haven't even made a decision yet.
1584580	1585580	Okay, Connor.
1585580	1589580	It seems like you're happy as long as I'm coming.
1589580	1592580	Dan, I've always been candid about that.
1592580	1595580	Connor, give me your, like, top three, five.
1595580	1600580	Riff some of, like, your top five or whatever teleportation moments.
1600580	1601580	Like, what would you want to do?
1601580	1602580	Holy crap.
1602580	1604580	Yeah, you've thought about teleportation a lot.
1604580	1605580	Way too much.
1605580	1608580	Yeah, what would some of the coolest stuff you can do with this?
1608580	1611580	Oh, you can steal ones from your friends like people have given you good ones.
1611580	1614580	I guess the question that people always ask right then is,
1614580	1617580	can you teleport your dick into a girl's vagina?
1617580	1618580	Which...
1618580	1619580	It doesn't make sense.
1620580	1623580	It's also called rape, I think.
1623580	1625580	Yeah.
1625580	1628580	Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan.
1628580	1629580	Is that a rape joke?
1629580	1630580	Dan, don't.
1630580	1633580	It was not a rape joke.
1633580	1635580	I really, I seriously want to know.
1635580	1636580	And I don't...
1636580	1638580	Can you joke about rape jokes?
1638580	1640580	Can you make a rape joke joke?
1640580	1641580	I can because I'm not famous.
1641580	1643580	You can't.
1643580	1644580	Yeah.
1644580	1647580	I called my grandma a nigger in that show and nobody cared.
1647580	1648580	Yeah.
1649580	1650580	That's right.
1650580	1651580	How's that going to play in Huff Po?
1651580	1652580	Jeff...
1652580	1656580	By the way, Jeff Davis dropped an n-bomb too in that show.
1656580	1659580	Now are you clicking on us?
1659580	1660580	You're right.
1660580	1661580	It's all about the headline.
1661580	1662580	Okay.
1662580	1663580	So give me yours.
1663580	1666580	What's the pie in the sky teleportation?
1666580	1668580	The pinnacle of that?
1668580	1669580	I don't know.
1669580	1674580	It's never been something so specific, but it'd probably just be so much funny shit
1674580	1675580	to fuck with people.
1675580	1676580	Just pranks.
1676580	1677580	Yeah.
1677580	1678580	That would be so fun.
1678580	1679580	They think...
1679580	1680580	Yeah.
1680580	1681580	Yeah.
1681580	1682580	You know what else is fun?
1682580	1683580	Coming.
1685580	1689580	But yeah, I wonder what would make Aaron happier.
1689580	1690580	My wiener or...
1690580	1692580	You leaving and dying on the moon.
1694580	1695580	I could...
1695580	1697580	She's alone with all that money.
1699580	1701580	I could take her to Hawaii.
1701580	1702580	I could take her to...
1702580	1703580	The moon.
1703580	1704580	I could take her to the moon.
1704580	1708580	If we find a space suit designed for, you know, Fomky Johnson.
1710580	1711580	What?
1712580	1713580	All right.
1714580	1715580	I'm still...
1715580	1718580	I mean, I'm only playing devil's advocate here.
1718580	1719580	I want to be sold on teleportation.
1719580	1722580	Anybody else out here have a good teleportation idea?
1722580	1723580	Instant skydiving.
1723580	1725580	Instant skydiving.
1725580	1728580	Just remember to teleport before you hit the ground.
1728580	1729580	Right.
1729580	1730580	Or before you black out.
1730580	1731580	Yeah.
1731580	1733580	Yeah, that's because you could always be falling.
1733580	1734580	That would be fun.
1734580	1735580	That would be good.
1735580	1740580	I would say this would probably be great for people that have passed their sexual prime.
1740580	1744580	I think a lot of people would choose this at the age of, like, you know, 58 or something.
1744580	1746580	You've got, like, Betty White teleporting around.
1746580	1747580	Yeah, Betty White would just be Robin Banks.
1747580	1749580	Stealing everything.
1750580	1754580	There's something about the security, too, also because I'm becoming a doomsday prepper, I've decided.
1756580	1757580	Like, that's...
1757580	1762580	If you can teleport, you don't need to waste any energy doomsday prepping.
1762580	1766580	You know, you are prepped for doomsday because you're set.
1766580	1771580	Like, you're all the more secure in an event of Armageddon.
1771580	1773580	Like, it doesn't matter.
1773580	1774580	You wouldn't need a bomb shelter.
1774580	1775580	You wouldn't need anything.
1775580	1777580	You could just, like, now you can just hang out.
1777580	1778580	Like, they could go...
1778580	1788580	In the news today, gold dropped three silver points, and the Russians are threatening to invade Afghanistan again.
1788580	1791580	And your friends would be like, oh, man, should I buy a shotgun?
1791580	1792580	And you'd be like, I don't care.
1794580	1795580	They'd be like...
1795580	1799580	Kind of like being Highlander, except you get to die at 60.
1800580	1804580	Was teleportation your ultimate superpower, or are there other ones that are better?
1804580	1807580	Or did you pick that because it might balance the scales?
1807580	1809580	I think it's a good balancer.
1809580	1812580	What would be your ultimate superpower if you could have one gift?
1812580	1813580	One?
1813580	1818580	I mean, maybe teleportation because I don't want to waste all the time I thought about it, but...
1819580	1823580	I could at least just throw that out there to make sure that I cover myself.
1823580	1826580	But invisibility, flying, all that stuff's cool.
1826580	1828580	But teleportation is like flying, I guess.
1828580	1831580	What would be your big power, Jeff, if you get to choose one?
1832580	1834580	I've thought about this with Matt Grohle.
1834580	1837580	I think, Matt, we talked about, like, there's superpowers that are super.
1837580	1840580	Like, you could fly, or you have super strength, or invulnerability, or whatever.
1840580	1846580	There's also mundane superpowers that, like, you can speak every language.
1846580	1852580	The rule is, you can't become a real criminal, and you can't do great good with it.
1852580	1857580	So you can pick something that's kind of cool, but you couldn't commit a crime by having that power.
1857580	1860580	So, if I had a superpower, definitely flight.
1860580	1863580	If I had a mundane power, speak every language.
1863580	1865580	Be able to talk to anybody in the world. I think that would be very cool.
1865580	1866580	That would be cool.
1866580	1867580	Yeah.
1867580	1872580	Maybe you can have both, and you'd be like, oh, look, it's flying snob.
1872580	1874580	Bonjour!
1875580	1879580	Every time you, like, conjugated wrong in French, and somebody goes like,
1879580	1883580	uh, more Beaujolais, if you'll play it, and you, like, land and go like,
1883580	1886580	it would be sill, I'll play, because she's a woman.
1889580	1890580	Away!
1894580	1900580	Also, I thought it'd be really cool if, like, if you had the power to just be in a room full of people,
1900580	1901580	and just go...
1903580	1907580	And tell you enough, that I just got, like, groaning, and everyone looks at you, and just, boom!
1907580	1911580	It bursts into a pulp of hot blood and meat.
1911580	1917580	And just go, pfft! I just, like, cover the walls, and there's just flesh and brains all over everybody.
1917580	1921580	And after everybody stops screaming, reform.
1922580	1933580	Why are you applauding that? Why are you encouraging him?
1933580	1939580	Like, I think there's three other people that want that power, and two of them got the electric chair.
1939580	1944580	See, like you, Connor, I've given mundane superpowers a lot of thoughts.
1944580	1947580	And another one is the ability to jump out of any window.
1947580	1952580	It could be out of this window here at Meltdown, or out of a plane, or out of the Empire State Building,
1952580	1956580	and jump out of a window, and immediately reappear behind people that are looking out the window.
1958580	1964580	Here's a guy, Mundane, when I think we talked about this, the ability to manipulate any printed language.
1964580	1965580	Oh, yeah, the change words!
1965580	1968580	Like, if you were on a bill, if you would just drive past a billboard, and it says, like,
1968580	1974580	buy Levi jeans, you could just make it say, like, go fuck yourself, like, in the same font.
1975580	1979580	You could just put Alan Thicke's face up there, like, there's a dog on his dick,
1979580	1983580	and you just wave your hands, like, dude, I don't know what you'd call that, like,
1983580	1986580	I am Photoshopper.
1988580	1990580	I am Adobe.
1990580	1994580	Like, when they look back, though, it's back to normal, and they just really fucked up.
1994580	1997580	You could change a Hollywood sign, but for ten seconds.
1997580	2002580	Well, I would, well, I don't know. I mean, I guess that's fun, but then you're just making a bunch of people think they're crazy,
2002580	2008580	whereas if you could change, like, billboards, and then everyone was like, you gotta go up and change that.
2008580	2013580	I think that breaks my rule of you could use that for evil, you could change the constitution.
2013580	2018580	Well, because you could easily be, like, super Banksy, like, you could be, like, subvert the government, like, everywhere.
2018580	2022580	No, you could change serial numbers on money, like, you could use that for evil.
2022580	2026580	Yeah, well, that's the cool, I just, we just watched one of the four movies we watched in bed today,
2026580	2030580	it was X-Men First Class, which is awesome, by the way, I guess I'm the last to know that.
2030580	2036580	I didn't bother to watch it, because there wasn't a big hubbub, but I guess when you're 40, like, the hubbub doesn't reach you.
2036580	2040580	It's just 18-year-olds, like, their hubbub is contained amongst each other.
2040580	2045580	They're probably at the sock hop going, X-Men First Class was great!
2045580	2049580	And then I'm just driving by in my Prius, and I don't even hear it, you know?
2049580	2054580	It's not like they're gonna flag down the car, hey, old man, you should go see X-Men First Class!
2054580	2057580	And then do a hula hoop with us.
2057580	2062580	But I finally watched it today with Aaron, it was really swell, really groovy.
2062580	2065580	To quote them in the movie, to use their parts.
2065580	2068580	Twelve, twelve, twelve.
2068580	2071580	But I thought, did you guys like X-Men First Class?
2074580	2077580	It's like a hootenanny, but with just the movie.
2077580	2082580	All right, Dan, Mundane, can't use it for evil, can't use it for good, super power.
2082580	2085580	Well, I really like the font one, really.
2085580	2089580	Just because you really can't use it for gain.
2089580	2094580	If it's conceivable to use that to rob a bank, or to commit to fun.
2094580	2099580	Well, that's why I thought of X-Men First Class, because the cool thing about these X-Men movies, the X-Men mythology,
2099580	2104580	is that if you can think of it, and then you really commit to it, if someone's bored with it,
2104580	2108580	you reveal that this person has figured out how to use it for good or evil,
2109580	2115580	but so let's just say I can't use my photoshopping ability for good or evil,
2115580	2118580	I can only use it for entertainment, I think that's a big one for me.
2118580	2121580	Because if we could just be in a restaurant, I guess you'd get bored with it,
2121580	2126580	I would just slide the menu over to you and go, I think special number three is right up your alley.
2126580	2129580	I don't want the dick and balls, Dan.
2131580	2133580	I had that last night.
2134580	2137580	Connor, you had a moment to think about this, Mundane, super power.
2137580	2139580	I've been trying to think right now.
2139580	2143580	It's a tough one. If anybody in the audience has one, in the front row, yes, miss?
2143580	2145580	Just hover above the ground like two inches.
2145580	2148580	Two-inch hover. David Blaine.
2149580	2152580	Two-inch hover is good, because it's cool, but who gives a shit?
2153580	2156580	What about control over insects?
2156580	2158580	Oh, you could commit a crime with that.
2158580	2165580	Stand in the middle of your garage and go, and all the roaches line up in a grid.
2166580	2168580	Aquaman, but for insects?
2168580	2172580	I think it's a way. I can conceive of ways that you could use that power over a year.
2172580	2176580	Well, let's go with that challenge, though. There's a way that you could...
2176580	2180580	No, it's exploding into a pulp on people and then reform it.
2180580	2183580	Society is defined by that. Of course you could use that.
2183580	2187580	You could go, for instance, everyone give me a million dollars or I'll come to your party.
2188580	2190580	No one wants you to do it.
2190580	2191580	And they'd say, why? I'll blow up myself.
2191580	2194580	I'm the pulp guy. Have you Googled me?
2195580	2197580	I know, it's cool, but when the dust settles, he's just there.
2197580	2200580	Oh, that's the problem with that one, is because once you've done it a few times, then word gets out.
2200580	2202580	Yeah. What are you thinking about?
2202580	2204580	But the window thing would always be great.
2205580	2208580	Because you'd always find somebody like, oh, World Trade Center.
2209580	2211580	That building's gone. Let me pick a better one.
2212580	2214580	I was just trying to pick a tall book.
2214580	2216580	Flash and 12. National tragedy, Flash and 12.
2217580	2220580	Teleport, teleport. Yes? You got one?
2221580	2223580	If you could change your hands into tools.
2223580	2225580	You could change your hands into tools.
2226580	2230580	You just want to move the baby gate and you're like, where's that number eight socket?
2230580	2233580	And then you're just like, that would be awesome.
2233580	2237580	Could you use that for lock picking stuff like that? Is it all tools?
2237580	2239580	Or do you get like a leather man on your index finger?
2239580	2241580	Can I point something out to you, Jeff, though?
2241580	2243580	Yeah, we're just spit bombs.
2243580	2250580	Yeah, I know, but you are hung up on this idea that there's such a thing as a power that normal people don't have
2250580	2257580	that can't be bent to a person's advantage when society is defined by the fact that no one has an edge.
2257580	2262580	Anyone that does have an edge has used that edge to gain power over people.
2262580	2265580	And so if you could turn your hands into tools.
2265580	2269580	See, that to me gets into super power. That's plastic man.
2269580	2272580	You're not listening to me. All powers are super powers.
2272580	2275580	Like David Copperfield can't even actually do anything.
2275580	2277580	He can only make it look like he does some stuff.
2277580	2279580	And he's rich and famous.
2279580	2286580	I'm only using that as a level to say you can't cross over into something actually useful.
2286580	2289580	He's not listening to me. He's not. He's not listening.
2289580	2291580	It's like talking to a wall.
2291580	2295580	Because people keep saying, people are going like, oh, I want a fishing pole for a dick.
2295580	2298580	And you're going like, well, I don't know if that counts.
2298580	2301580	Because you could catch so many fish that you could like...
2301580	2304580	No, that one counts. That one works.
2304580	2307580	You cannot rob a bank with a fishing pole, Dick.
2307580	2309580	Is that robbing the bank the litmus test?
2309580	2310580	Let's call it that, yes.
2310580	2312580	Okay, fine. Anything you can't rob a bank with.
2312580	2314580	Or commit like a major crime with.
2314580	2316580	I can commit a major crime with a fishing pole, Dick.
2316580	2318580	Let's hear it. Let's hear it.
2318580	2319580	Okay.
2319580	2320580	Fade in.
2320580	2327580	Okay. I come up to you and I go, hey, can I have your social security number?
2327580	2328580	No.
2328580	2334580	Can I have it if I have a fishing pole for a dick?
2334580	2336580	You know what?
2336580	2338580	All right. Sip.
2338580	2340580	What?
2340580	2341580	Where's my money?
2341580	2342580	Yeah.
2342580	2346580	Yeah, and I usually, I fished it out of your pocket with a...
2346580	2347580	I don't know.
2347580	2353580	If you're always able to correct someone in a conversation, if they're wrong, you're like, oh, no, actually, it's this way.
2353580	2355580	You couldn't use that for evil.
2355580	2357580	They're like, oh, no, this guy was born in this year.
2357580	2360580	You're like, without me looking at your phone, without me looking at Google...
2360580	2362580	So just the smartest person in the world.
2362580	2363580	Sure.
2363580	2365580	We don't know it until someone says the wrong thing.
2365580	2366580	You're like, well, actually, it's this way.
2366580	2369580	So you don't know everything. You just know when someone's wrong.
2369580	2371580	You just have like the...
2371580	2377580	It's like word puts a red squiggly line underneath anything that anyone says.
2377580	2378580	It's this way.
2378580	2381580	It's called a super asshole.
2381580	2385580	They sat in a room full of scientists and they all just go through a bunch of statements.
2385580	2387580	Oh, yes.
2387580	2391580	Beef fungus Bill says that a team of evil geniuses would pull them in and chain them to a chair.
2391580	2392580	Yeah.
2392580	2393580	And say things until they...
2393580	2395580	Yeah, they would use them as the magic mirror.
2395580	2397580	You know, mirror, mirror of them all.
2397580	2401580	You used to have been undone by Beef Fungus Bill.
2401580	2402580	Yeah, back there?
2402580	2403580	Yeah.
2403580	2405580	You can control what other people's food tastes like.
2405580	2407580	You can control what other...
2407580	2408580	Wow.
2408580	2410580	Control what other people's food tastes like.
2410580	2413580	That's fucked up.
2413580	2417580	Mr. President, did you enjoy your roast beef sandwich last night?
2417580	2419580	It tasted like poop, but...
2419580	2428580	And it will again unless Mount Rushmore is my face four times.
2428580	2431580	I'll eat poop until I die before I see that happen.
2431580	2434580	Well, good.
2434580	2440580	I don't think the OPEC will feel the same.
2440580	2441580	Yes, you sir, over there?
2441580	2445580	You could turn into a duck, but you would have the brain of a duck.
2445580	2449580	You could turn into a duck, but would have the brain of a duck.
2449580	2454580	Would a duck be able to control turning back into a human?
2454580	2456580	There's just a clock on it, I assume, right?
2456580	2461580	It's like one of those light switches in cheap bathrooms where it's a dial.
2461580	2463580	I'm going to turn into a duck and then you just...
2463580	2471580	You're a duck that's just walking around wanting to have sex with ducks and fly south if it's cold.
2471580	2476580	Five minutes a duck just don't go near a fancy restaurant because that would be bad news.
2476580	2479580	Or be near people with shotguns.
2479580	2480580	I would do this one.
2480580	2483580	You could be a duck, you could set the timer on it.
2483580	2486580	You could say I want to be a ten-second duck or a ten-minute duck or whatever.
2486580	2490580	You would do whatever the duck would normally be doing, but you would have your eyes.
2490580	2492580	You'd be seeing for the duck's eyes.
2492580	2496580	So you could fly and you could be in a pond and you could fuck another duck.
2496580	2497580	And you could eat breadcrumbs and shit.
2497580	2500580	Like John Malkovich, like the beginning of being John Malkovich.
2500580	2503580	You could eat breadcrumbs, you guys.
2503580	2507580	Dan, he picked duck.
2507580	2509580	I didn't pick duck.
2509580	2512580	That's the fact that you could eat breadcrumbs.
2512580	2514580	Beef fungus bill says what?
2514580	2515580	What if you're flying and the timer runs out?
2515580	2516580	You turn back into you.
2516580	2517580	You just come back into your own body.
2517580	2518580	Yeah, while you're flying?
2518580	2519580	Yeah.
2519580	2521580	No, no, no.
2521580	2526580	You basically just transport your soul into a duck, but you can't control the movements of the duck.
2526580	2528580	I'd go for that, right?
2528580	2529580	Yeah.
2529580	2530580	So you'd just be, Kelly?
2530580	2531580	It's just like an obvious one.
2531580	2534580	You could be constantly drunk and high with no repercussions.
2534580	2536580	Constantly drunk and high with no repercussions.
2536580	2539580	Could you like turn that off or do you want to turn that off?
2539580	2540580	No, but you can't turn it off.
2540580	2541580	Okay.
2541580	2545580	Her super power is just to be fucked up all the time.
2545580	2547580	But with no repercussions.
2547580	2548580	That's within reach.
2548580	2549580	You can have that.
2549580	2550580	Yeah.
2550580	2551580	All right, wait.
2551580	2552580	Come on.
2552580	2553580	We've got other stuff we've got to do.
2553580	2554580	We've got to go.
2554580	2557580	You can control the length of all your body hair at will.
2557580	2560580	That's practical and you can't rob a bank.
2560580	2563580	You can control all the hair on your body at will.
2563580	2564580	The hair length.
2564580	2565580	The length of it.
2565580	2568580	Well, you could maybe grow a mustache and then not have a mustache.
2568580	2569580	I don't know.
2569580	2570580	Okay.
2570580	2575580	You open a bank account as a mustache guy and then you're like, if my cousin comes in here,
2575580	2578580	let him rob you.
2578580	2580580	He won't have a mustache.
2580580	2581580	I don't know how banks work.
2581580	2584580	I haven't been in one for years.
2584580	2585580	All right.
2585580	2586580	All right.
2586580	2589580	Connor, everybody, thank you very much for Connor.
2589580	2596580	Segment Saver.
2596580	2599580	We should have Connor come.
2599580	2603580	You think, are you a person that's obsessed with teleportation sex questions,
2603580	2609580	or are you a person that could come up with one of those quandaries each week?
2609580	2611580	I feel like I could do that if I put my mind to it.
2611580	2613580	We'll give you a shot next week.
2613580	2615580	Maybe we'll put that on our notepad.
2615580	2619580	We'll have Connor's question.
2619580	2620580	Connor's quest.
2620580	2624580	And if your name was Tony, we wouldn't do it because Connor sounds like a...
2624580	2625580	There's no alliteration.
2625580	2626580	I don't know.
2626580	2629580	He sounds like he could be like a villain.
2629580	2630580	Just a riddler.
2630580	2631580	He does look like Frank Gorshin.
2631580	2632580	That's what it is.
2632580	2633580	He does.
2633580	2634580	Okay.
2634580	2635580	Look at Frank Gorshin.
2635580	2636580	I'm going to Google that.
2636580	2637580	You don't know?
2637580	2638580	No.
2638580	2639580	Okay.
2639580	2640580	He has a great Burt Lancaster impression.
2640580	2641580	Twelve.
2641580	2642580	Twelve.
2642580	2644580	The young eat the old, man.
2644580	2646580	But what are they left with?
2646580	2652580	You know, 100 degree weather and a bunch of shitty comic book movies.
2652580	2653580	Good luck.
2653580	2654580	Have fun.
2654580	2659580	I'll be laughing at you through the worms in my eyes.
2659580	2662580	I had Knight Rider.
2662580	2663580	It was a thing.
2663580	2665580	Knight Rider was pretty good.
2665580	2666580	I mean...
2666580	2667580	Oh, was it?
2667580	2671580	Well, if you go back and check, like a lot of those episodes are like,
2671580	2675580	Oh, these lumberjacks are so corrupt.
2675580	2676580	You know what?
2676580	2677580	You know what?
2677580	2679580	I want to go back and watch the original A-Team series.
2679580	2686580	I'm pretty sure it's still good because George Pappard, a really good actor, wore cowboy boots.
2686580	2688580	And one time somebody put him in a...
2688580	2693580	They dug a dirt pit and they left him in the pit and they took his boots as a kind of final insult.
2693580	2697580	And then the rest of the A-Team found him and he was in the pit and he's got a cigar
2697580	2700580	and he's down there in his little, like, cargo jacket.
2700580	2702580	He's in a hunting, you know, vest.
2702580	2706580	And, like, I guess Mr. T or someone looks down at him and says,
2706580	2707580	What happened?
2707580	2708580	He goes,
2708580	2710580	They took my boots.
2710580	2712580	Nobody takes my boots.
2712580	2714580	And I believe they went to commercial on that.
2714580	2717580	And that, to me, is where TV peeks.
2717580	2718580	They took his boots.
2718580	2720580	And then he kicked everybody's ass.
2720580	2721580	A lot of that stuff doesn't hold up, though.
2721580	2725580	I mean, the thing in your head is so much better.
2725580	2726580	You go back and...
2726580	2728580	Well, I've talked about it before.
2728580	2731580	Don't go back and watch the Goonies.
2731580	2733580	I'll just bum you out.
2733580	2736580	Just hang on to your Goonies in your head.
2736580	2738580	It's a beautiful, wonderful adventure.
2738580	2742580	It's going through tunnels controlled by dead pirates.
2742580	2747580	You don't want to go back and watch that thing with a human brain.
2747580	2748580	All right.
2748580	2749580	We're going to bring a special guest to the stage.
2749580	2753580	Jeff, do you remember when we were at the Egyptian theater after our Harman Town tour?
2753580	2756580	We did a three and a half thousand hour show.
2757580	2759580	It just ended a couple days ago.
2759580	2766580	Part of it was we had special guests that were Kickstarter donors to the show itself.
2766580	2769580	Got to come up and play Dungeons and Dragons with us.
2769580	2770580	Yes, I do.
2770580	2776580	One of those guys is here tonight because I was having drinks with him Friday.
2781580	2784580	He was bummed out about how it went down at the Egyptian.
2785580	2787580	I guess Spencer told him to...
2787580	2789580	Why don't we bring him up?
2789580	2792580	There's a little bit of a conspiracy happening here.
2792580	2794580	It's like a little to be unraveled.
2794580	2796580	Can you guys please welcome Roy McClurg?
2803580	2805580	Thank you for coming again.
2805580	2806580	Oh, okay.
2806580	2809580	Roy, I saw you backstage, but I didn't place you from that show.
2809580	2816580	Roy's here with his lovely life, which consists of him and his lovely wife Penny,
2816580	2823580	who I rapped about doing it with on stage because she wasn't a fan of the podcast.
2823580	2824580	I don't think she's here yet.
2824580	2825580	Oh, she's not here.
2825580	2828580	No, I think she's just making up the fact she was coming.
2828580	2830580	Well, let's do it again.
2831580	2832580	Fuck yeah.
2836580	2838580	But Roy is kind of a...you're from Dallas, Texas.
2838580	2839580	Right, right.
2840580	2841580	Hey.
2841580	2842580	Wow.
2842580	2843580	Two of you.
2843580	2844580	Good.
2844580	2846580	And you're up here again.
2846580	2848580	You were just in San Francisco, right?
2848580	2849580	Yeah, last night.
2849580	2851580	Because you're producing some kind of jazz album.
2851580	2856580	I'm working with a jazz artist to help him get his new album off the ground.
2856580	2860580	I was hoping that he could come here with his saxophone and play hot, steamy music for us.
2860580	2862580	Well, I've got him on here if we need it.
2862580	2864580	If anybody wants to get hot and steamy.
2864580	2866580	Well, can I plug in?
2866580	2867580	Other than...
2867580	2868580	Can I plug in and play some of that, Roy?
2868580	2869580	Absolutely.
2869580	2870580	Do we have clearance from your friends?
2870580	2871580	We have clearance.
2871580	2872580	What's his name?
2872580	2874580	Oh, you have to go off the...
2874580	2875580	Oh, this is porn.
2875580	2876580	Yeah, I'm sorry.
2876580	2878580	Roy, you had to be Asian boys.
2880580	2882580	It wasn't supposed to be that.
2882580	2885580	How do you know those aren't jazz musicians, Jeff?
2886580	2888580	Are you that racist?
2889580	2891580	They weren't holding flutes.
2895580	2898580	And they weren't using them improvisationally.
2900580	2901580	Yeah.
2901580	2905580	They didn't recapitulate the original melody and creative out there ways.
2906580	2907580	Jazz.
2907580	2919580	So when you got to the Egyptian and you kicked in some money that we used to produce the Egyptian show,
2919580	2921580	for the right to come up...
2921580	2925580	That was your Kickstarter reward, was that you got to play D&D.
2925580	2926580	So then it was you and the other guy.
2926580	2928580	Who's the other guy?
2928580	2930580	Was it Sean Sakame?
2930580	2931580	Okay.
2931580	2932580	Thank you.
2932580	2934580	Snap the jab for our long time listeners.
2934580	2936580	I did not name him.
2937580	2938580	That's his Twitter handle.
2938580	2943580	But you guys then, Spencer said, you said he came up to you.
2943580	2947580	Well, we were in the green room before the show and he was handing us our character sheets.
2947580	2949580	I had never done it, ever.
2949580	2953580	I was so forward to it except for listening to Harmontown.
2953580	2956580	So he gives us the sheets and we're reading over all these spells.
2956580	2964580	I had these nasty spells and he says, you know, if you guys want to kill somebody, go ahead.
2965580	2968580	To me, I took that as, he wants us to kill somebody.
2968580	2973580	And so we spent about 30 minutes trying to devise how to kill somebody, who to kill.
2973580	2977580	And even during the show, we're sitting in the front row going, okay, now how are we going to do this one?
2977580	2979580	Or what are we going to be?
2979580	2981580	And it went back and forth, back and forth.
2981580	2984580	And when we got on stage, we completely just crapped ourselves.
2984580	2989580	And what transpired was, I mean, Jeff and I were six sheets to the wind.
2989580	2990580	I was sober.
2990580	2994580	That was probably one of the most insane D&D sessions ever.
2994580	2999580	I think the characters just ended up sitting around a campfire and alternately attacking each other.
2999580	3000580	Right.
3000580	3003580	And then being like, hey, let's play it cool.
3003580	3006580	No one knew what the hell was going on.
3006580	3010580	I got to a point where all I did was look at the sheet and see the spells I could cast and go,
3010580	3013580	uh, inflict the moderate damage.
3013580	3014580	And that's all I said.
3014580	3016580	And he'd have to prompt me on who.
3016580	3017580	I didn't know.
3017580	3018580	I just pointed this way.
3019580	3027580	So I told Roy, you should come down on Sunday and we should play D&D again because he's a grown man.
3027580	3029580	It's not going to affect the rest of his life.
3029580	3034580	But I can feel that you were looking back on the Egyptian show and going, like, I think I did something wrong.
3034580	3037580	No, I was looking at it that I drank too much.
3037580	3038580	Oh.
3039580	3041580	I remember that moment very well.
3041580	3047580	And I can't think of a better way to underscore the emotions that were going on than Michael Linkton's track,
3047580	3048580	Heat.
3062580	3064580	The lights have gone down.
3066580	3068580	So this is what they listen to in Texas, huh?
3069580	3070580	Okay, I got to defend him.
3070580	3072580	They listen to him everywhere.
3072580	3073580	Everywhere.
3073580	3075580	Listen to Michael Linkton pick up his CDs.
3075580	3076580	He's got seven of them.
3077580	3081580	All right, so I want to bring Spencer up so we can hold.
3082580	3083580	Let's continue this dialogue.
3083580	3085580	Spencer, are you here?
3086580	3087580	He's coming.
3097580	3098580	Hey, everybody.
3098580	3100580	Welcome, Spencer Crittenden to the stage.
3101580	3102580	Oh, yeah.
3102580	3105580	You're listening to the cool sounds of Michael Linkton.
3106580	3107580	Is that what it was?
3107580	3108580	Yeah.
3108580	3110580	You go into the northeast passage.
3111580	3114580	A moss covered wall yields two exits.
3116580	3120580	For those of you with low light vision tonight, you're going to see a couple tripwires.
3127580	3128580	This is sexy.
3130580	3131580	Sexy Spencer.
3131580	3138580	Spencer, can you, when we start D&D, will you do all the exposition as sexy jazz guy?
3138580	3139580	I could try that.
3139580	3140580	Yes.
3140580	3141580	All right.
3141580	3142580	You're going to try it, my friend.
3142580	3143580	You're going to try.
3143580	3144580	All right, Spencer.
3145580	3146580	Why did you tell?
3146580	3147580	I was in danger.
3147580	3151580	I thought I was going to be misrepresented, but he played it pretty straight.
3151580	3152580	That's pretty much how it happened.
3152580	3155580	You tell people to kill us?
3155580	3160580	Would you feel comfortable admitting how much you kicked in on that Kickstarter on the Egyptian?
3161580	3162580	Couple bucks?
3162580	3163580	Yeah.
3163580	3169580	If you pay a couple bucks, anyone who pays a couple bucks, I'd say deserves a chance
3169580	3176580	to, if not kill someone, at least attempt to kill a pretend version of them on a stage show.
3176580	3180580	No, I think we tried to kill each other pretty hard for about 45 minutes.
3180580	3182580	I wouldn't say it was that hard.
3185580	3186580	All right, okay.
3186580	3188580	You guys, you guys, you guys.
3188580	3189580	Wait, wait.
3189580	3190580	You fucked around for a bit.
3190580	3192580	Are you going to try to kill us again tonight?
3192580	3193580	He didn't tell me to.
3193580	3194580	I never told you to.
3194580	3196580	I just said feel free if you want to.
3196580	3198580	Okay, it's like the Jedi mind trick, he said.
3198580	3201580	If you'd like to kill them, you want to kill them, don't you?
3201580	3203580	Yeah, yeah, I did say it like that.
3203580	3204580	Yeah.
3204580	3205580	All right.
3205580	3212580	Well, let's get our other D&D players, Kumail Nanjiani and Aaron McGathey out here.
3220580	3221580	You can sit.
3221580	3222580	I'll just stand.
3222580	3223580	I can stand here.
3223580	3224580	No, you...
3224580	3226580	That's okay.
3226580	3228580	I'm okay standing.
3230580	3231580	Oh, yeah.
3231580	3233580	We need another mic.
3233580	3235580	Oh, yeah.
3235580	3236580	Here, Aaron.
3236580	3239580	There's a gold mic for you, or Dan.
3242580	3246580	May I describe my everyday superpower?
3246580	3247580	Dan?
3247580	3249580	Yes, yes.
3250580	3253580	Jeff mentioned that I immediately knew what it was, because I think I've thought about
3253580	3255580	this for a long time.
3255580	3261580	I would like to smell like a childhood memory of whomever I'm talking to.
3264580	3265580	At will.
3265580	3266580	I can decide who...
3266580	3270580	If I'm talking to somebody, I'm like, a little too much, then I don't.
3270580	3271580	I don't smell like anything.
3271580	3276580	But if I really want to please somebody, I immediately smell like the plastic balls of
3276580	3280580	Chuck E. Cheese or whatever, and they immediately associate me with something positive, and
3280580	3282580	it's more than someone just liking me.
3282580	3283580	So, just pee.
3283580	3284580	You want to smell like...
3284580	3286580	If that's what it is.
3286580	3287580	You want to pee in cheese.
3287580	3294580	Immediately, I'm familial and important in someone's life, and they respect me.
3294580	3300580	If I could pick a superpower for you, it would be the least weird pronunciation of the word
3300580	3301580	important.
3302580	3305580	Aaron, would you say you want to be important?
3306580	3307580	I mean, okay.
3307580	3309580	Just say it casually.
3309580	3312580	You know what's really important to me?
3312580	3316580	My relationship with Dan and my friendship with Jeff are both very important.
3316580	3318580	No, that's not how you say it.
3318580	3319580	Important.
3319580	3320580	Important.
3320580	3321580	Important.
3321580	3322580	She says important.
3322580	3323580	Important is really good.
3323580	3324580	I like it.
3324580	3325580	Thanks, Kumail.
3325580	3326580	I like important.
3326580	3327580	Thank you.
3327580	3329580	I think it's important to...
3329580	3331580	Wait, am I exaggerating it now?
3331580	3332580	No, it's fine.
3332580	3335580	Also, Colin was so great up here, but did you just...
3335580	3336580	Connor.
3336580	3337580	Connor.
3337580	3338580	Connor.
3338580	3340580	I can't believe you guys don't know who Frank Gorshin is, by the way.
3340580	3342580	We're in the back of a comic book store.
3342580	3345580	I just think it's very important to know people's names.
3345580	3346580	I'm sorry.
3346580	3349580	She pronounces Connor Colin, though, as part of her mispronunciation.
3349580	3350580	Yeah.
3350580	3351580	Yeah.
3351580	3352580	You guys remember everything.
3352580	3356580	Connor was great up here, but did you just ask him to do a game corner every week?
3356580	3357580	Oh.
3357580	3358580	Is that kind of what happened?
3358580	3360580	I mean, that's really cool and really awesome.
3360580	3364580	And Connor, if you want to van a white to your game corner, I can hold up a sign with
3364580	3365580	either thing.
3365580	3366580	No, we're good.
3366580	3374580	It was more of like a fire starter, like kind of topic he'd be providing, I think.
3374580	3376580	Yeah, it's just like a quick thing.
3376580	3377580	It's still a game.
3377580	3379580	It's still something that I could do.
3379580	3381580	You don't own games.
3381580	3383580	I know I don't own games.
3383580	3386580	I want to know what it smell like to you, Jeff.
3386580	3387580	What?
3387580	3388580	P?
3388580	3389580	I don't know.
3389580	3390580	No.
3390580	3392580	Probably your mom's freshly washed hair or like something.
3392580	3393580	That's not an insult.
3393580	3394580	My mom's dead too.
3394580	3395580	Oh my God.
3395580	3396580	You're so important.
3396580	3397580	My mom is also dead.
3397580	3398580	You're so important.
3398580	3403140	Can I tell you what my mundane power is that won't hurt anyone?
3403140	3407780	I would want to be the rock for five minutes a day.
3407780	3408780	Like control him?
3408780	3409780	Like being John Malcolm?
3409780	3410780	No.
3410780	3411780	I don't even care if I have no agency.
3411780	3416620	I just want to see how people see the rock and it could be any five minutes a day.
3416620	3420780	If it's once it's like, if it's like a drop taking a dump, then I'm like, no, I know what
3421780	3424780	it feels like to be the rock taking a dump.
3424780	3427780	You know, he came up at the community writers room for some reason we were talking about
3427780	3428780	the Flintstones.
3428780	3437780	And then one of the writers said, do you think that the rock in the modern reboot of the
3437780	3445780	Flintstones, would his name just be the everything?
3445780	3449780	And I peed a little because I mean, those aren't the kind of jokes that go into community
3450780	3452780	but but we have a lot of fun.
3452780	3453780	They keep the room up there.
3453780	3455780	We hired some smart, funny people.
3455780	3456780	I think we have a good time.
3456780	3462780	The rock looks like, if all the race is fucked, he looks, the rock looks like the future.
3462780	3463780	He's biracial, isn't he?
3463780	3466780	He's only like, like part Samoan, part, what am I?
3466780	3468780	All rock, part tooth fairy.
3468780	3469780	He's part something, part something.
3469780	3475780	And he's definitely yet another piece of evidence that, what do they call it?
3475780	3477780	Interracial mixing.
3477780	3478780	Right.
3479780	3483780	There was a fancier word for...
3483780	3484780	Miscegenation.
3485780	3486780	Get out.
3486780	3488780	That's the opposite of the fancy word for that.
3490780	3492780	It is not miscegenation, sir.
3493780	3495780	There's also a really fancy word for Brazil nuts.
3495780	3496780	I can't remember.
3496780	3498780	Sir, could you...
3501780	3502780	Whatever.
3502780	3503780	Anyways, we had a guest a long time ago.
3503780	3505780	Did we ever air that or was that back before Harmontown aired?
3505780	3507780	That might be pre-punk.
3507780	3513780	That guy who wrote a book about like how biracial people are healthier, the idea that
3513780	3518780	biracial people are physically healthier and in fact more attractive to us.
3518780	3519780	For sure.
3519780	3521780	I mean, I've seen biracial babies and they're gorgeous.
3521780	3525780	And it was based on the attractiveness thing, which is how do you measure attractiveness?
3525780	3528780	And for him, it all boiled down to symmetry.
3528780	3533780	You can actually measure the amount of symmetry in your face.
3533780	3534780	It was pop science.
3534780	3538780	I mean, the guy wasn't like a qualified scientist, but he wrote a very interesting, compelling book about...
3538780	3541780	So not a qualified scientist is not a scientist.
3541780	3542780	Right.
3542780	3544780	He was a guy with opinions.
3544780	3547780	Well, he was a guy that researched and wrote a book.
3547780	3550780	He looked a bunch of biracial kids and was like, these are pretty cute.
3550780	3551780	Yeah.
3551780	3555780	I mean, it was kind of like the back of the book was like, isn't holly berry hot?
3556780	3557780	I mean, look at her.
3557780	3560780	Most of the words are just, look at this one.
3560780	3562780	It's just pictures of babies.
3562780	3563780	And brat.
3563780	3564780	Yum, yum.
3564780	3565780	Yeah.
3565780	3566780	Tiger, why do you kick an ass?
3566780	3567780	Yeah.
3567780	3568780	Me likey.
3568780	3570780	Just over and over.
3570780	3574780	There's some biracial guy under a bridge somewhere, eating out of a...
3574780	3577780	Yeah, it's great.
3577780	3578780	We're all superhuman.
3578780	3579780	Go fuck yourself.
3579780	3584780	I think this might sound a little non PC, but any non-Asian race with any Asian race,
3584780	3589780	those babies, first of all, Asian babies already are like so cute.
3589780	3591780	Like, take it down a notch.
3591780	3592780	You're making the rest of us.
3592780	3593780	Woo!
3593780	3596780	I see an Asian babysitting there wooing.
3596780	3600780	And Roy, Roy, we're not talking about your internet history.
3600780	3603780	We're not talking about those kind of Asian babies.
3603780	3605780	Then there were babies.
3605780	3607780	Didn't you look?
3607780	3610780	They had their flutes.
3610780	3612780	Babies don't have flutes.
3612780	3614780	Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
3614780	3615780	Sorry.
3615780	3618780	Asian with non-Asian creators.
3618780	3620780	Who's a classic celebrity?
3620780	3623780	Tyson Beckford is half black and half Asian,
3623780	3627780	and he looks like it makes me believe in God again.
3627780	3632780	Lucy Liu is half Asian and half white, and she's very beautiful.
3632780	3633780	This is a weird...
3633780	3634780	This is the book!
3634780	3635780	We're recapping the book.
3635780	3637780	And it's chapter three, Lucy Liu.
3637780	3638780	Right?
3638780	3639780	It's just right?
3639780	3641780	Who's with me?
3641780	3648780	The index of his book is Lucy Liu, you go girl, 32, 49.
3649780	3650780	All right.
3650780	3651780	My real...
3651780	3652780	I'll tell you what my...
3652780	3653780	Yes, you have a...
3653780	3654780	What?
3654780	3655780	I don't know.
3655780	3658780	What we do here is we just let them run rampant.
3658780	3660780	Go ahead inmates.
3660780	3662780	We have a hand up in the front row here.
3662780	3666780	I actually wanted to say that I made some D&D themed gifts
3666780	3668780	for everybody here in the audience.
3668780	3669780	Someone in the front row.
3669780	3671780	So we made D&D themed gifts.
3671780	3672780	Oh, nice.
3672780	3674780	She's brought gifts that are D&D themed for us.
3674780	3676780	Are they half Japanese babies?
3677780	3679780	Oh, is it gift time?
3679780	3680780	Is Sikh here?
3680780	3681780	Yeah.
3681780	3682780	Are you here?
3682780	3684780	Can you come up here while she's...
3684780	3685780	Are you...
3685780	3686780	Yeah?
3686780	3691780	You sound like you're locked in a chest.
3691780	3693780	Do you want to wait until later, Sikh?
3693780	3696780	Adam Goldberg has brought the reading material.
3696780	3698780	While he comes up, I can say this.
3698780	3699780	Are we waiting for him to come up?
3699780	3700780	Oh, he's here.
3700780	3701780	Yeah.
3701780	3703780	Sikh is a long time Armenian.
3703780	3705780	He's been struggling with...
3705780	3709780	He's an aneurysm survivor and did a Kickstarter
3709780	3712780	to do this comic book about a superhero
3712780	3714780	who knows his days on Earth are numbered
3714780	3717780	and is seeking to go and make amends
3717780	3718780	with all his supervillains.
3718780	3719780	That's a great idea.
3719780	3720780	It's pretty amazing.
3720780	3721780	That's a great idea.
3721780	3724780	And how can we talk about anything else again ever?
3724780	3728780	Well, he brought copies of the book that he wanted to...
3728780	3730780	Oh, yeah, thanks.
3730780	3736780	Sorry, you got it overshadowed.
3736780	3738780	Like, in your face.
3738780	3739780	I brought cupcakes.
3739780	3742780	Yeah, well, he survived an aneurysm.
3742780	3745780	But I love cupcakes.
3745780	3748780	No, actually, what I brought was something a little bit rarer
3748780	3749780	than the book.
3749780	3752780	We sold out of the book thanks to Dan's support.
3752780	3754780	I don't know if you guys know, but on his birthday,
3754780	3758780	he donated to the book and made it possible.
3758780	3761780	And it's been my dream to make a comic book.
3761780	3763780	And ever since I was eight years old,
3763780	3764780	he made it possible.
3764780	3767780	And then he tweeted to you guys to donate, too.
3767780	3769780	And a lot of you guys donated on his birthday,
3769780	3772780	which I thought made the whole book worth it.
3772780	3773780	So what I did was I made a very...
3773780	3776780	Yeah, I had candles to blow out that day.
3776780	3779780	But what I did was I made a very special print.
3779780	3781780	I lost my...
3781780	3783780	I had a lot of damage to my temporal lobe,
3783780	3785780	which means a lot of my visual memories are gone.
3785780	3787780	Visual memories?
3787780	3788780	All your memories?
3788780	3789780	Oh, okay.
3789780	3793780	All right, so I can't remember a lot of things visually.
3793780	3795780	So it's hard for me to draw.
3795780	3796780	I used to draw.
3796780	3799780	So I told Kevin Eastman this, who is the creator of the Ninja Turtles.
3799780	3800780	Yeah.
3800780	3803780	And he said, well, I want to draw something with you.
3803780	3806780	So will you draw something and then I'll ink it?
3806780	3808780	And I said, well, that would be a dream come true.
3808780	3811780	And he goes, well, let's do it and make it an exclusive thing.
3811780	3812780	Wow.
3812780	3815780	So it's a very limited number of print.
3815780	3816780	Ooh.
3816780	3817780	Oh, cool.
3817780	3821780	That I drew the girl and he inked it and did the rest.
3821780	3824780	So we just made 200 of these and I wanted to give everyone here.
3824780	3825780	Okay, great.
3825780	3826780	Oh, wow.
3826780	3827780	Wow.
3831780	3832780	It's amazing.
3838780	3841780	All right, well, seek hands those out, lady.
3841780	3842780	You want to follow that?
3842780	3843780	Yeah.
3844780	3846780	I survived double cancer.
3848780	3852780	What if she did ratchet it up and painted herself into this corner?
3852780	3854780	No, what was your what was it?
3855780	3857780	What was your name?
3857780	3858780	Samantha.
3858780	3859780	Right, right.
3859780	3860780	Okay.
3860780	3862780	And here, take the mic and tell us what you brought for everybody.
3862780	3867780	So I just made like key chains with everybody.
3867780	3870780	Everybody's D&D character names.
3870780	3873780	And I made special ones for Spencer and Kumayo.
3873780	3876780	Does it just say God on Spencer?
3876780	3880780	And so I made about like 70, so I'm not sure if there's enough for everybody,
3880780	3882780	but I made special ones for you guys.
3882780	3883780	Oh, thank you.
3883780	3885780	Thank you, Samantha.
3885780	3887780	Personalized D&D key chains.
3887780	3888780	All right.
3893780	3898780	After the show, also, one of you here, we're raising a barn.
3900780	3903780	What if we just became this weird insular community?
3903780	3907780	Somebody brought a bushel of corn, and we just all helped each other.
3907780	3908780	Thank you.
3908780	3909780	Mine says cork.
3909780	3910780	Oh, thank you.
3910780	3911780	That's amazing.
3911780	3912780	Thank you.
3912780	3913780	Thank you.
3913780	3914780	I mean, you dropped one.
3914780	3917780	If we were good people, we would have a food drive once in a while.
3917780	3918780	Did you get one?
3918780	3919780	I do.
3919780	3920780	I have cork.
3920780	3921780	Yeah, that would be something we could do.
3921780	3925780	Oh, speaking of charity, as long as we're in this warm, glowing portion,
3925780	3929780	Roy, you were telling me about a charity that you support over drinks.
3929780	3931780	You don't just support it over drinks, but...
3931780	3933780	It's easier to.
3933780	3938780	There's a charity started in L.A. It's called After School All-Stars,
3938780	3942780	and I'm part of the Dallas chapter.
3942780	3949780	And what this organization does is it takes at-risk kids from three to six...
3949780	3951780	You get some drunk?
3951780	3952780	Yeah.
3952780	3955780	That's why they're at risk.
3955780	3956780	Yeah.
3956780	3957780	That's why...
3958780	3960780	I just pulled apart.
3960780	3962780	Dan, you're like the Incredible Hulk.
3962780	3967780	Like, I can't love these hands.
3967780	3972780	Dan managed to destroy one of the keychains, and now there's these handmade keychains.
3972780	3975780	I just destroyed mine in front of Samantha.
3975780	3976780	Oh, you got one.
3976780	3977780	Great.
3977780	3978780	Okay.
3978780	3980780	That one I'm going to put in my pocket and put in my...
3980780	3982780	I'm sorry about that.
3982780	3985780	That is awful.
3985780	3986780	All right.
3986780	3987780	Sorry, Roy, the charity.
3987780	3989780	Well, so anyway, they don't get drunk.
3989780	3995780	What they do is they help channel the kids into whatever programs they have an interest in,
3995780	4002780	and they specify in the arts, in drama, painting, acting, music,
4002780	4004780	because there's not enough of that in the schools now,
4004780	4006780	especially seventh, eighth, ninth grade kids.
4006780	4009780	So they create programs for these kids to do after school,
4009780	4013780	so they're not out just roaming the street and getting in trouble,
4013780	4014780	breaking the law, that kind of thing.
4014780	4016780	And they also do some sports programs also for them.
4016780	4017780	What's it called again?
4017780	4019780	It's called After School All-Stars.
4019780	4020780	So you can pull it up online.
4020780	4021780	It's a really nice charity.
4021780	4023780	You can donate to it.
4023780	4024780	You can also...
4024780	4025780	They look for mentors.
4025780	4029780	So they look for people who are interested in just hanging out with these kids
4029780	4034780	and pushing them in the right direction rather than, you know, getting in trouble all the time.
4034780	4037780	So it's a nice charity, and it's...
4037780	4039780	And also, like our country being a capitalist nation,
4039780	4045780	that is supposed to be an innovative, like, industrial nation.
4045780	4048780	Like, we're supposed to come up with ideas and create things,
4048780	4053780	which justifies our kind of hegemony and our...
4053780	4058780	You know, we have been, as we have been entering the global economy,
4058780	4062780	have been scaling back on our educational programs.
4062780	4064780	And the first corners that we've been cutting
4064780	4069780	are the corners that send kids into spheres where they become creative.
4069780	4070780	Right, yeah.
4070780	4072780	The whole creativity thing is gone now.
4072780	4074780	They don't have art programs.
4074780	4075780	They don't have music programs.
4075780	4078780	You know, if you see somebody that, you know,
4078780	4082780	a seventh grader who picks up a trumpet and decides to start playing it,
4082780	4084780	there's nobody to sit there and pat him on the back.
4084780	4085780	He goes to school and goes,
4085780	4087780	I found this weird thing I blew into it and made a noise,
4087780	4090780	and the teacher's like, yeah, are you going to be a mechanic or a math teacher?
4090780	4092780	Yeah, right.
4093780	4096780	I feel so sad.
4098780	4099780	No, it's good.
4099780	4100780	We're helping.
4100780	4102780	We give money to this to help the kids.
4102780	4103780	No, it's great.
4103780	4104780	It's great.
4104780	4105780	It's all very sad.
4105780	4106780	Well, no, it's...
4106780	4108780	Well, there's also, like, avian flu,
4108780	4110780	and Yellowstone Park's going to turn into a supervolcano.
4110780	4113780	Like, any minute now, your heart could stop.
4113780	4115780	I can't draw anymore.
4115780	4116780	Oh, man.
4116780	4118780	That's so awful.
4118780	4119780	Yeah.
4119780	4120780	Well, welcome to Hermitage.
4120780	4121780	Well, they can draw.
4121780	4122780	Well, they teach kids to draw.
4122780	4123780	It's good.
4123780	4124780	They'll all learn.
4124780	4126780	They'll all be painters.
4126780	4130780	I was going to say one real quick thing for real superpower.
4130780	4131780	Mine would be...
4131780	4134780	Well, I'm just trying to make it happy again.
4134780	4135780	You didn't have one?
4135780	4136780	Well, I would...
4136780	4138780	My genuine real one would be time travel.
4138780	4142780	I would do that just because I've eaten a lot of shitty pizza, you know?
4142780	4144780	I was just like, hey, don't eat it.
4144780	4145780	It's not great.
4145780	4146780	That's deep.
4146780	4147780	That's very deep.
4147780	4148780	Dude, you've had shitty pizza.
4148780	4149780	It's no good.
4149780	4150780	Yeah.
4150780	4154780	I was knowing you already got all the calories of a good pizza, but it tastes...
4154780	4155780	Listen, we could talk about this.
4155780	4156780	I was going to say you could...
4156780	4161780	I went to Chicago and asked everybody I met in Chicago, people that worked in restaurants
4161780	4163780	and bars and people that were locals.
4163780	4165780	I polled everybody, what's the best pizza in town?
4165780	4166780	I went to a place...
4166780	4168780	It was the shittiest slice of pizza I've ever had in my life.
4168780	4169780	What was it called?
4169780	4172780	I don't know if I remember, but it was like one of the biggies and it was garbage.
4172780	4175780	I was like, I'm full of shit pizza right now.
4175780	4176780	See?
4176780	4177780	We could have gone back in time.
4177780	4180780	You can mail everyone about your charity slice of life.
4180780	4183780	It's about people who've had shitty pizza.
4183780	4184780	Yeah, that's really great.
4184780	4187780	And they're a Nike fuel band now.
4187780	4190780	They have to run so much more to keep up with it.
4190780	4195780	So what this does is it takes money away from them so they can't eat and then they lose
4195780	4196780	that weight again.
4196780	4200780	I was actually thinking for a second, like, oh, that would be a good mundane super-par.
4200780	4203780	You had to throw a switch where you could just eat whatever you wanted and your body
4203780	4204780	wouldn't process it.
4204780	4205780	I was like, oh, bulimia?
4205780	4208780	Yeah, you can have that power.
4208780	4215780	By the power of condor feather, I...
4215780	4218780	But we were saying, like, you know how everyone says go back, kill Hitler?
4218780	4221780	I was talking to my friends, Tom Lennon and Matt Meyer, who are, like, very funny.
4221780	4222780	And I'm not name-dropping.
4222780	4223780	I just want to give them credit.
4223780	4226780	You're not name-dropping if the name is Matt Meyer.
4226780	4227780	Yeah.
4227780	4228780	That's...
4228780	4229780	Okay.
4229780	4233780	I thought Tom Lennon was doing the heavy lifting of that name drop.
4234780	4236780	Did you add Myra for ballasts?
4236780	4237780	Yeah.
4237780	4238780	Well...
4238780	4239780	I'm just kidding.
4239780	4240780	It's a joke.
4240780	4245780	We were saying it would be much more productive if you went back to... with, like, a bunch
4245780	4250780	of Steven Spielberg movies to show Hitler and be like, hey, look, they're not... they're
4250780	4251780	pretty good, right?
4251780	4252780	Yeah.
4252780	4254780	But don't show him Schindler's list.
4254780	4257780	Because he's like, oh, this is what Oscar is doing.
4257780	4258780	And then...
4260780	4262780	Like, you mean he'd be like, oh...
4262780	4264780	He's like, oh, this is what this guy's been doing that I've been trusting.
4264780	4265780	He's got a list.
4265780	4266780	Oh, God.
4266780	4267780	Oh, God.
4267780	4268780	He would use it to kill Schindler.
4268780	4269780	Yeah.
4269780	4270780	He would kill Schindler.
4270780	4271780	Or at least take his list.
4271780	4272780	Wait, wait, wait.
4272780	4273780	Also, don't...
4273780	4275780	How about go back a little further?
4275780	4276780	A little further before he met Oscar?
4276780	4277780	I don't know.
4277780	4278780	Just because I don't want...
4278780	4281780	Well, you don't want to kill, like, 28-year-old Hitler.
4281780	4282780	No, don't want to kill him.
4282780	4283780	Because what if...
4283780	4284780	Like, it would be weird.
4284780	4288780	Like, he'd be, like, hanging out and, like, at a coffee shop and, like, playing Yahtzee.
4288780	4290780	And you come up and you're just garroting him.
4290780	4291780	And it's like playing Yahtzee.
4291780	4296780	And you're what Hitler's favorite childhood memories smell like.
4296780	4302780	His dad's booze-soaked breath as he dragged him home from the Austrian bars.
4302780	4303780	Also, don't...
4303780	4307780	Oh, yeah, I read Mein Kampf.
4307780	4312780	It's hard out there for a Hitler.
4312780	4314780	Headline?
4314780	4316780	Dan Harmon says it's hard out there for Hitler.
4316780	4318780	Michael Osiello.
4318780	4322780	Dan Harmon, soft on Hitler.
4322780	4327780	Hitler's not so bad, Dan Harmon.
4327780	4331780	Harmon says he'd like to picnic with Stalin.
4331780	4336780	After Harmon did a cosmetic gesture of bringing up the aneurysm guy,
4336780	4339780	he proceeded into the meat of his lecture.
4339780	4344780	And he called him the aneurysm guy.
4345780	4349780	Also, total teleportation, right?
4349780	4352780	Like, between the two things, just thinking about that discussion.
4352780	4354780	It's obviously teleportation.
4354780	4356780	It's so cool you could go anywhere.
4356780	4357780	Oh, you do?
4357780	4358780	Well, are you okay if I can't come anymore?
4358780	4359780	If I can teleport?
4359780	4360780	Well, I was going to say this.
4360780	4364780	I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Aaron is not with you because of your dick.
4364780	4368780	Like, I don't mean that in a bad way.
4368780	4370780	You can have the best dick in the world.
4370780	4371780	I have no idea.
4371780	4373780	Honey, honey, honey, take a vacation.
4373780	4376780	But guys, you should read his dick.
4376780	4378780	I mean, it's wording.
4378780	4379780	It's beautiful.
4379780	4383780	It's very concise.
4383780	4387780	It's like a dick jigest.
4387780	4389780	It's very well edited.
4389780	4391780	My dick is a haiku.
4391780	4396780	But may I just really quick ask you about this fleet of virile gentlemen
4396780	4398780	who are going to fuck me?
4398780	4401780	And can I also ask you what you think my sexuality is?
4401780	4407780	Because it's certainly not just having someone hammer my pussy.
4407780	4410780	I think you would have a say in the matter.
4410780	4413780	He doesn't have a team of guys.
4413780	4416780	I'd be like, baby, pick a continent.
4416780	4418780	I'm going to round you up.
4418780	4419780	Hi, I'm Aaron.
4419780	4421780	My boyfriend made an arrangement.
4421780	4425780	You want to go equatorial tonight?
4425780	4426780	I'll be right back.
4426780	4428780	You want something spicy tonight?
4428780	4431780	A little surf and turf?
4431780	4434780	Surf and turf.
4434780	4437780	I don't know what that means, but I like it.
4437780	4442780	It means Omar Sharif and Tony Hawk.
4442780	4444780	Surf and turf.
4444780	4447780	I like that.
4447780	4450780	Hey, you want to stay in for Italian tonight?
4450780	4457780	I would have you scour the earth for men with your same brain and heart.
4457780	4461780	But who chose sex instead of teleportation?
4461780	4463780	Well, I mean, I would choose teleportation over sex.
4463780	4466780	I love having sex.
4466780	4467780	But you know what I love more?
4467780	4473780	Being able to go anywhere on the snap of two fingers.
4473780	4479780	But also, if you're giving up sex, it's not like your drive is also dead, right?
4479780	4480780	I mean, you probably still have it.
4480780	4482780	That'd be a good consequence.
4482780	4484780	I mean, sex is great, but like past the age of 20,
4484780	4488780	it's not like this magical diamond that you search for at the end of a cave.
4488780	4489780	Like, I've had a ton of sex.
4489780	4490780	I don't give a shit.
4490780	4491780	Like, I'll go.
4491780	4494780	No, if you couldn't have sex, it would be if you still had the sexual drive
4494780	4496780	and you never had sex.
4496780	4499780	Like, imagine when I was 12 to 21.
4499780	4501780	I mean, I think about it all the time.
4501780	4504780	I don't want to go back to that, where all I want to do is have sex
4504780	4506780	and the one thing I couldn't do was have sex.
4506780	4508780	But you magically go anywhere?
4508780	4509780	That's what teleportation is, right?
4509780	4510780	But you kind of have sex.
4510780	4513780	Who are you impressing with your powers?
4513780	4515780	I didn't think the drive would be there.
4515780	4519780	But also, you can go anywhere.
4519780	4520780	It just takes a little longer.
4520780	4521780	You could get on a plane.
4521780	4523780	There's places you could go to.
4523780	4524780	That's not true.
4524780	4529780	You can't just travel to Queen Elizabeth's bathroom.
4529780	4532780	Actually, it's on the tour.
4532780	4537780	Teleportation means that you can go anywhere, right?
4537780	4539780	I also love that you guys could go anywhere.
4539780	4542780	The first place you talked about was Ground Zero.
4542780	4545780	Well, you could go to Ground Zero.
4545780	4546780	Well, we were talking...
4546780	4547780	We were not today.
4547780	4549780	We were going to put a flower there.
4549780	4552780	We were talking about if it happened, you know,
4552780	4554780	like while it was happening, if we had that power,
4554780	4555780	if another 9-11 happened.
4555780	4556780	It would be like...
4556780	4558780	You could save like 200 people.
4558780	4559780	But you call it blink blink.
4559780	4561780	You're like, oh, I can barely do anything.
4561780	4563780	There are professionals trying here.
4563780	4565780	But the crazy thing is you'd go nuts because you'd go,
4565780	4570780	okay, 9-11, which is like the Mick Jagger of global events.
4571780	4572780	And then you'd go...
4572780	4575780	That's going to be in variety for sure.
4575780	4577780	And then you'd go like, oh, what about the pixies
4577780	4580780	of constant starvation and global world,
4580780	4581780	like the class system's like,
4581780	4583780	I can't use my teleportation.
4583780	4586780	I can try to like feed people.
4586780	4588780	You would be like Santa Claus.
4588780	4591780	Like you would just have a big sack of food.
4591780	4593780	Like I'm going to go...
4593780	4595780	It's not like there would ever be a point
4595780	4597780	where you could take a break.
4597780	4598780	Like if you...
4598780	4601780	Every time you did, you'd know the faces of the people
4601780	4603780	that you let go hungry.
4603780	4605780	So you're saying if you had teleportation,
4605780	4607780	you would just travel giving food to people
4607780	4608780	who don't have access to food?
4608780	4610780	I think you would fall into that because otherwise
4610780	4611780	you couldn't even enjoy.
4611780	4612780	What are you going to do?
4612780	4614780	Teleport to the tip of the pyramid, like some jag off
4614780	4616780	and go like, woo!
4616780	4619780	Like while you know that like in Africa,
4619780	4620780	like there's people...
4620780	4621780	You could just bring them antibiotics
4621780	4622780	like in the blink of an eye.
4622780	4624780	Aaron, where would you go if you could teleport?
4624780	4626780	Where would you pop off to like first off?
4626780	4627780	Not the most important.
4627780	4630780	What were some places you would like to be?
4630780	4631780	Okay.
4631780	4633780	I'd like to go...
4633780	4636780	Like if there's a super Parisian couple
4636780	4639780	that was really...
4639780	4642780	Parisian people are really curious to me.
4642780	4643780	I'd like to go into a couple's apartment.
4643780	4644780	Are you invisible?
4644780	4645780	You're not invisible.
4645780	4646780	You can do Airbnb.
4646780	4647780	You're not invisible.
4647780	4648780	You're a person.
4648780	4649780	Okay, that's fine, that's fine, that's fine.
4649780	4651780	You want to just watch people fucking Paris?
4651780	4652780	No!
4652780	4654780	You can have that arranged very easily.
4654780	4658780	I mean, well, yes, but not like first.
4658780	4659780	Wait, wait.
4659780	4661780	Tell me more about Parisian people.
4661780	4662780	The first place I would go...
4662780	4664780	Well, this is a very boring answer.
4664780	4666780	I've always wanted to go to India.
4666780	4667780	I would go to India.
4667780	4670780	Kumail's home, India.
4670780	4673780	I would want to see Kumail's parents and his stories.
4673780	4675780	Why don't you use your superpower to get a clue?
4675780	4676780	I'd like to see Kumail's...
4676780	4680780	I'd like to see Kumail's magic carpet in India.
4680780	4684780	And he'd give you a tour of the set of Outsourced?
4684780	4685780	Yeah.
4685780	4686780	Shot on location.
4686780	4687780	They shot there, didn't they?
4687780	4688780	And they shoot in India?
4688780	4692780	Yeah, they did shoot there.
4692780	4693780	Do you know...
4693780	4695780	I don't want to talk about that show.
4695780	4698780	Do we know that you were asked to audition for that show?
4698780	4699780	I'm just guessing.
4699780	4702780	We can assume.
4702780	4703780	Yes, I was.
4703780	4704780	I would just want to go anywhere.
4704780	4707780	I mean, first I would probably want to go from Los Villas
4707780	4710780	to Beverly Hills in a second instead of five hours.
4710780	4711780	This is better than...
4711780	4713780	That's probably what it would be.
4713780	4715780	I also would very much miss having sex.
4715780	4716780	I like having sex.
4716780	4718780	I definitely want to have children.
4718780	4719780	Enjoy having sex with Dan.
4719780	4726780	We have great, wonderful, fulfilling, emotional, romantic sex
4726780	4728780	that is meaningful and great.
4732780	4733780	Sorry.
4733780	4734780	And four times.
4734780	4735780	Technical difficulties.
4735780	4736780	Technical difficulties.
4736780	4737780	Technical difficulties.
4737780	4738780	Stick with us, you guys.
4743780	4744780	Disney.
4751780	4752780	All right.
4752780	4753780	Spencer.
4753780	4754780	Spencer, where would you teleport to?
4754780	4756780	What?
4756780	4757780	Or a superpower choice.
4757780	4760780	I'd teleport to a place where people take this game seriously.
4760780	4761780	I'd teleport to a place where people take this game seriously.
4761780	4762780	Oh, sorry.
4762780	4764780	It only worked that way.
4764780	4765780	It was overlapped.
4765780	4767780	It wouldn't have worked any other way.
4767780	4769780	What's up, you guys?
4769780	4774780	By the way, I didn't know that two weeks ago your dad played my character.
4774780	4775780	Yeah.
4775780	4776780	This is...
4776780	4778780	I'm so honored and I'm not even doing a bit.
4778780	4779780	Like that's...
4779780	4782780	In my head, your dad looks exactly like Gandalf.
4784780	4785780	Yeah.
4785780	4786780	The white.
4786780	4787780	The white.
4787780	4788780	So he's even above the gray.
4788780	4789780	Okay.
4789780	4790780	I'm very excited.
4793780	4794780	I never met your dad.
4794780	4795780	I don't...
4795780	4797780	What is your definition of honor?
4799780	4800780	Is your dad awesome?
4800780	4801780	No.
4805780	4808780	That only makes you a bigger conundrum to me.
4809780	4811780	They're still going through some stuff.
4811780	4812780	Yeah.
4812780	4814780	Life is going through some stuff, you know?
4814780	4816780	That's right.
4816780	4820780	Did that show bring you guys any closer or did it push you farther apart or did it change anything?
4820780	4821780	I don't really...
4821780	4822780	No.
4822780	4823780	I mean, whatever.
4823780	4826780	It didn't affect anything.
4827780	4828780	All right.
4828780	4829780	Oh, I missed that.
4829780	4830780	I don't know what the history is.
4830780	4831780	Nothing happened.
4831780	4832780	Nothing happened.
4832780	4834780	It's all stagnant.
4834780	4836780	Well, let's make something happen Spencer.
4836780	4842780	I want you to give us the character sheets and I want you to introduce D&D tonight to
4842780	4848780	the sweet, mellifluous, honey-flowing notes of Michael Linkton's smooth jazz.
4848780	4849780	Do you guys want...
4849780	4850780	Here's the track names.
4850780	4851780	Stay with me.
4851780	4852780	I've already played Heat.
4852780	4853780	This is one you've been hearing.
4853780	4854780	So stay with me.
4854780	4856780	Everything must change.
4856780	4858780	Oh, that doesn't sound romantic.
4858780	4860780	And one is called When I Hold You.
4860780	4861780	What do you guys want to...
4861780	4862780	When I Hold You?
4862780	4863780	When I Hold You.
4863780	4864780	All right.
4864780	4865780	Let's see you.
4865780	4866780	Okay.
4866780	4867780	Are any of these lyricized?
4867780	4869780	No, that's all instrumentals.
4869780	4871780	All right.
4871780	4874780	Can you give it your smooth jazziest best?
4874780	4879780	I can give it my most embarrassingly honest attempt.
4879780	4881780	That's all we ever ask from you, Spencer.
4881780	4882780	All right.
4882780	4883780	Shall we?
4883780	4884780	I guess.
4884780	4885780	Spencer Crittenden, everybody.
4885780	4886780	Thank you.
4886780	4887780	Let's start.
4887780	4899540	Last time on Harmon Town, our heroes, having been whisked through a tree by means of rooting
4899540	4905780	wood growth, the third, were brought to Mango Butzalot's yellow camp, home of the Butzalot's
4905780	4906780	barbarians.
4907780	4911780	The group was horrified to discover demons infesting the encampment.
4911780	4918780	Leaping into action, Christoperg stabbed a demonic taskmaster, and Sharpie blasted him
4918780	4919780	with fire.
4919780	4924780	Mulrain and Quark had a brief aside before attacking the demon.
4924780	4930780	Daggers, swords, knives flew, and the demon was slain.
4930780	4935780	The heroes broke out of the bonds of two chained barbarians, but their victory was
4935780	4937780	short lived.
4937780	4948780	Oozing out of a massive pit came several slimy lemures that sharpened and tangled the wriggling
4948780	4953780	mass with his spring-powered vines.
4953780	4957780	The lemures were trapped for now.
4957780	4964780	But will our heroes be able to use their borrowed time wisely and bring back the barbarian
4964780	4970780	badass before the brief bramble barricade is breached by the blobby brutish lemures?
4970780	4972780	Alliteration.
4972780	4975780	Is sensual.
4975780	4977780	Sibilance.
4977780	4981780	We'll find out next on Harmon Time.
4988780	4995780	I'm really feeling this.
4995780	4997780	This is some great tunes.
4997780	4999780	Sorry to cut off your praise.
4999780	5000780	That was awesome, man.
5000780	5001780	Thank you so much.
5001780	5005780	I didn't hear a single thing you said because of my giant throbbing erection right now.
5005780	5009780	It's just beating in your ears.
5009780	5012780	I could cut glass right now.
5012780	5016780	All right, so I'm wounded right now?
5016780	5018780	I take it no one listened to me.
5018780	5019780	I didn't hear a thing you said.
5019780	5020780	No, we heard.
5020780	5023780	Jeff, last week you and I made a pact.
5023780	5025780	But I don't think Jeff was.
5025780	5026780	Oh, you or Jeff?
5026780	5027780	Right.
5027780	5028780	I was playing Jeff.
5028780	5029780	You were playing court?
5029780	5030780	I was playing you.
5030780	5033780	Dan made the decision to have Adam Goldberg play me.
5033780	5034780	But you know what?
5034780	5035780	He...
5035780	5037780	The role he was born to play.
5037780	5040780	He, you, didn't agree to the pact, if I remember correctly.
5040780	5041780	No, we did.
5041780	5045780	He thought better of it in his mind, but outwardly he accepted it.
5045780	5049780	What you might be thinking of is that the point of the bit was that Jeff would never
5049780	5051780	agree to it, so it seems weird.
5051780	5052780	But he did.
5052780	5053780	He did.
5053780	5054780	What is the pact?
5054780	5055780	What was the pact?
5055780	5059380	Well, that you and I are making an alliance and we're best friends, and we got each other's
5059380	5060380	backs forever.
5060380	5061780	We love each other, and everything's great.
5061780	5062780	BFFs.
5062780	5063780	BFFs.
5063780	5064780	All the time.
5064780	5065780	Okay, I...
5065780	5071780	You remind me of that right now, and I hold out my amulet of winter, and I go, sounds
5071780	5072780	cool to me.
5073780	5079780	And I hold out my amulet of summer, and I say, uh, hot it up!
5083780	5085780	Those are demons booing you.
5085780	5086780	I mean, you're right.
5086780	5087780	That wasn't funny and didn't make sense.
5087780	5089780	The boo is really...
5089780	5090780	So, the answer is yes.
5090780	5092780	The pact is agreed upon.
5092780	5093780	Alliance?
5093780	5097780	Well, and I say, let me melt your asshole-ness with my amulet of summer.
5097780	5099780	And I say, go fuck off, you shit.
5099780	5101780	Well, that's the end of that alliance.
5101780	5102780	No, no.
5102780	5105780	I just said it was cool with me, and you called me names.
5105780	5106780	Oh, well, I apologize.
5106780	5107780	I thought you were fighting it off.
5107780	5108780	No.
5108780	5109780	I'm a little defensive.
5109780	5110780	No, no.
5110780	5111780	I was saying it sounds cool with me.
5111780	5112780	Hey, guys, we're supposed to fight demons.
5112780	5113780	Can we figure out this pact?
5113780	5114780	Okay, yes.
5114780	5115780	Were you saying it's cool?
5115780	5116780	Were you saying it's cool?
5116780	5117780	I'm saying it's cool with me.
5117780	5118780	Oh, I apologize.
5118780	5119780	I fist bumped you with my amulet and said it's cool.
5119780	5120780	I'm sorry, everybody.
5120780	5125780	Did I tell you about my sweet central sex with Dan Herrmann?
5125780	5127780	The German Herrmann.
5127780	5128780	Dan Herrmann.
5128780	5129780	You guys all saw that.
5129780	5130780	I said it was cool and that you called me an asshole.
5130780	5131780	You all saw that.
5131780	5132780	You're right.
5132780	5133780	You're right.
5133780	5134780	You're right.
5134780	5135780	You're right.
5135780	5136780	All right.
5136780	5137780	Okay.
5137780	5138780	You said amulet of summer.
5138780	5139780	This pact is on probation, already.
5139780	5140780	Probationary pact.
5140780	5141780	To the east.
5141780	5142780	To the east.
5142780	5143780	A large pit.
5143780	5146060	Out of which slithered those seven lemures.
5146060	5148920	Those ones that got entangled in Sharpie's vines.
5148920	5150100	To the west.
5150100	5157340	The two freed barbarian allies are freeing more trap barbarians, and you see one semi-familiar.
5157340	5160100	You think you might have saw him last on the plane of Twyla.
5160100	5164140	He's a half-orc gentleman with gleaming armor and a broad axe.
5164140	5165540	He's one of those slaves?
5165540	5167700	He was one of those slaves.
5167700	5170300	Or he was chained up as if he were one of those slaves.
5170300	5171300	Oh, okay.
5171300	5175860	But his bonds being freed, he trots up towards you.
5175860	5176860	Trot, trot, trot.
5176860	5179940	So where did we land on the pact, you guys?
5179940	5180940	I said cool.
5180940	5181940	She called me an asshole.
5181940	5183860	I'm kind of on the fence right now.
5183860	5184860	Ork.
5184860	5186860	Half-orc gentleman.
5186860	5189060	I remember you.
5189060	5195660	I often own up to the fact that I'm an alcoholic and have frequent blackouts.
5195660	5198180	Could you remind me where we met?
5198180	5200180	Go for it.
5200180	5201180	As do I.
5201180	5206180	I don't remember either, but we must have met somewhere.
5206180	5207180	It's Roy.
5207180	5208180	Yeah.
5208180	5209180	What's...
5209180	5210180	See, here's...
5210180	5212620	Here's the character.
5212620	5213620	What's Roy's name?
5213620	5214620	What's your name?
5214620	5215620	Sl...
5215620	5217620	Slab squat thrust.
5218620	5220620	Slab squat thrust.
5220620	5221620	Slab squat thrust.
5221620	5223620	Hey, that's slab squat thrust.
5223620	5225620	Oh, squat thrust.
5225620	5227620	How you guys doing?
5227620	5232620	Remember when we freed you from your bonds like 30 seconds ago?
5232620	5233620	That was you.
5233620	5234620	That was us.
5234620	5235620	How awesome.
5235620	5236620	I'm sorry, real quick.
5236620	5237620	Wait a minute, you're Christopher.
5237620	5238620	Yep.
5238620	5239620	Whoa.
5239620	5240620	I've heard of you.
5240620	5241620	Yeah, yeah, you like the song?
5241620	5242620	Yeah.
5242620	5243620	Lady and Red?
5243620	5244620	The one song, yeah, it's amazing.
5244620	5245620	It's a great song.
5246620	5248620	Did you write anything else?
5248620	5249620	Oh, yep.
5251620	5254620	You heard Woman in Green?
5254620	5256620	Bitch in Yellow was a real low point.
5256620	5257620	That was a bitch in yellow.
5257620	5258620	It was in the 90s.
5258620	5259620	It was in your gangster period.
5259620	5262620	I was trying to be relevant.
5262620	5265620	Sorry, is the first name Slab or Slab squat?
5265620	5266620	Slab squat.
5266620	5267620	Slab squat.
5267620	5268620	Okay, last name Thrust.
5268620	5269620	That's right.
5269620	5272620	Have you been since we've seen you last, SST?
5272620	5274620	What, 30 seconds ago?
5274620	5275620	I'm okay.
5275620	5277620	We are getting attacked by these bad guys.
5277620	5280620	Yeah, but we got to reacquaint each other before we do anything, right?
5280620	5281620	We have to all have packs.
5281620	5283620	I heard about a pack that was going on.
5283620	5286620	I make a pack with Slab squat Thrust.
5286620	5288620	So I don't have a packed person?
5288620	5289620	You can join our pack.
5289620	5290620	You want to do a three-way pack?
5290620	5291620	Yeah, we know.
5291620	5292620	Okay, thank you.
5292620	5297620	Let's you and I do a packed, and in his stand in between, and like, well, our pack to like
5297620	5300620	rub up against each other, but just the tip.
5300620	5302620	What do you think packed means?
5303620	5304620	Yeah, let's do it.
5304620	5308620	And while they're doing that, I go up to Quark and I'm like, hey, sorry, that's really right.
5308620	5309620	Yeah, I was just joking.
5309620	5310620	No, I know.
5310620	5311620	Yeah, whatever.
5311620	5312620	Whatever, it's cool.
5312620	5313620	We're good.
5313620	5314620	We're good.
5314620	5316620	Oh, God, that was a good packed.
5319620	5320620	Could have used some music, though.
5320620	5322620	Hey, why are you guys so wet?
5322620	5324620	Don't worry about it.
5327620	5328620	After packed.
5329620	5330620	All right, let's attack.
5330620	5332620	Let's attack some demons.
5332620	5334620	After packed.
5336620	5340620	So, yeah, you know, you tangled up those demons and vines.
5340620	5341620	Yeah.
5341620	5345620	Those are the closest demons, but looking to the north, you see a tall demon.
5345620	5351620	He's gray-skinned and skinny-styled, and he's got a scraggly beard made out of tentacles,
5351620	5353620	and he's wielding a fiery whip.
5353620	5358620	He's about 300 feet off, but he sees you over there, and he's coming towards you.
5359620	5360620	Is he a mind flayer?
5360620	5361620	He's not.
5361620	5362620	Oh, right.
5362620	5363620	I asked that before.
5363620	5364620	I like it, though.
5364620	5365620	What do you mean, skinny-style?
5365620	5366620	He's skinny-style.
5366620	5367620	Like a hipster, jeans?
5367620	5368620	Yeah, yeah.
5368620	5372620	Well, he's nude, but yeah, otherwise he looks like a hipster.
5374620	5375620	But like a demon.
5375620	5380620	He's just holding a giant cup of coffee, and his headphones are on his neck.
5381620	5388620	All right, I engage him ocularly, meaning I make eye contact.
5390620	5391620	Okay.
5391620	5396620	And I hold up a finger, like kind of a badass, like, don't.
5398620	5400620	Like a not today kind of eyes?
5400620	5402620	Yeah, like don't, just don't.
5402620	5405620	Like a Jeremy Renner kind of, don't.
5405620	5407620	Just don't.
5407620	5409620	He does.
5411620	5413620	Well, I told him not to.
5413620	5419620	As he continues his approach, he throws down his whip, and he flexes his flexible fingers,
5419620	5423620	and you can see blue and red flames dancing about his hands,
5423620	5426620	wreathing his arms in flaming flames.
5426620	5431620	I throw down whatever I'm holding, and I use shocking grasp.
5431620	5433620	I wreathe my arms in electricity.
5433620	5435620	You're about 150 feet off.
5435620	5436620	Yeah.
5436620	5438620	Can I try the don't thing against this guy?
5438620	5439620	Yeah, yeah.
5441620	5443620	He don't.
5444620	5447620	Maybe he didn't hear, maybe you weren't loud enough.
5448620	5449620	Don't.
5450620	5451620	He does.
5452620	5457620	I mean, he said there's a non-conflict resolution for us, so sometimes maybe it's saying don't.
5457620	5460620	What if all five of us did at the same time?
5461620	5462620	Everybody?
5462620	5463620	Yeah.
5463620	5464620	All right.
5464620	5466620	One, two, three, don't.
5466620	5467620	Yeah.
5467620	5468620	Don't on three?
5468620	5469620	Don't on one, two, three, don't.
5469620	5470620	So don't just four?
5470620	5471620	Don't just four, okay.
5472620	5475620	One, two, three, don't.
5482620	5483620	He does.
5484620	5485620	God damn it.
5485620	5489620	This guy's, at the very least, he's confused, right?
5491620	5492620	Okay.
5492620	5494620	Did he roll his eyes at least?
5494620	5495620	No.
5495620	5497620	Let's try one more thing together.
5497620	5498620	Okay.
5499620	5500620	The wave?
5500620	5503620	It's one, two, three, one, two, three, don't.
5503620	5505620	Step, ball, chain, pivot.
5505620	5506620	Okay.
5506620	5507620	And then can we say you look free?
5507620	5508620	Two steps.
5508620	5510620	Kick, turn, kick, turn.
5510620	5511620	Kick, turn, don't.
5511620	5512620	Okay.
5513620	5514620	All right, five.
5514620	5515620	Can we recap that real quick?
5515620	5516620	I'm sorry.
5516620	5518620	Guys, we opened in two nights.
5518620	5519620	Guys, I'm sorry.
5521620	5525620	Sharpie, what if we say you look great or something?
5525620	5527620	Keep on, keep it up.
5527620	5533620	Well, I say don't change what you're doing with your hair.
5533620	5534620	It's working.
5535620	5536620	Right.
5536620	5540620	We should each get a different compliment, so I'll be like, that's working.
5543620	5546620	And we all compliment a different aspect of him.
5547620	5549620	I talked to a nearby animal.
5549620	5551620	Are there any animals nearby?
5553620	5554620	No, no.
5554620	5555620	Oh, shit.
5555620	5557620	I was going to have like a wolf go...
5559620	5561620	That's great.
5563620	5564620	I'm a woman.
5564620	5566620	Yeah, so it'll mean more.
5566620	5567620	What?
5567620	5568620	It'll mean more.
5568620	5569620	Your compliment will mean more.
5569620	5570620	We're like monsters.
5570620	5575620	Okay, so I'll do that wolf whistle and I'll cover my breasts as if I'm afraid they're
5575620	5581620	going to explode from arousal, which is what happens every time a woman gets aroused, is
5581620	5584620	that they swell up to the point of explosion.
5584620	5586620	Which is why you chose teleportation.
5588620	5589620	Let's do it.
5589620	5590620	All right.
5590620	5591620	All right.
5591620	5592620	So it's five, six, five...
5592620	5593620	Go five, six, seven, eight, right?
5593620	5594620	Right.
5594620	5596620	Five, six, five, six, seven, eight.
5596620	5598620	Kick ball change, kick ball change.
5599620	5600620	Kick turn.
5602620	5603620	Change.
5603620	5605620	It's really working.
5608620	5609620	Yeah.
5612620	5613620	Yeah.
5614620	5615620	Is that him?
5615620	5616620	Like, yeah.
5616620	5617620	No, no, he's like...
5617620	5620620	And I lay on the ground and I give thumbs up and like a wink.
5620620	5625620	But I also make it clear that I don't want him to do anything.
5625620	5628620	But I'm just like, but you, you're doing it, you're doing it.
5628620	5629620	Yeah, yeah.
5629620	5633620	Spencer, I noticed that my strength and constitution are lower right now.
5633620	5634620	Is that from last week?
5634620	5637620	No, there just haven't been changed.
5637620	5641620	You guys had stat modifier penalties from losing your shadows.
5641620	5643620	I might not have changed those back.
5643620	5644620	Yeah, okay.
5644620	5645620	All right.
5645620	5648620	So he's 150 feet away from us right now.
5648620	5650620	I think he's much closer now.
5650620	5651620	Okay.
5651620	5654620	So what's the battlefield that we're on look like?
5654620	5656620	You're in the middle of this area.
5656620	5658620	There's a pit near you.
5658620	5659620	It's kind of blocking it off.
5659620	5661620	And there's those slimy devils.
5661620	5662620	And yeah, yeah.
5662620	5663620	Then there's Roy.
5663620	5666620	And he came from kind of the north area.
5666620	5668620	I said we send Roy in first.
5668620	5671620	Hey, Slap Squad, remember when we let you free?
5671620	5672620	Right.
5672620	5673620	Go do stuff.
5673620	5678620	This is your big chance to undo all that Egyptian anxiety from that show.
5678620	5679620	You want fame, Roy?
5679620	5680620	I mean, Slap Squad?
5680620	5681620	Well, fame costs.
5681620	5684620	And right now is where you start paying in sweat.
5684620	5685620	All right.
5685620	5688620	Roy, I'm going to give you my feather necklace just so you look cuter.
5688620	5689620	Oh, thank you.
5689620	5690620	Thank you.
5690620	5691620	I appreciate.
5691620	5692620	That's nice.
5692620	5693620	We tried don't, right?
5693620	5694620	Yeah, we tried don't.
5694620	5695620	That didn't work.
5695620	5696620	We tried don't.
5696620	5697620	We tried complimenting him.
5697620	5698620	We did a dance routine.
5698620	5699620	Right.
5699620	5700620	Okay.
5701620	5704620	Spencer, am I close enough to actually do anything to this thing?
5704620	5709620	You could, searing lights is the only thing you'd hit him with.
5709620	5711620	The rest, you'd have to be pretty close.
5711620	5712620	All right.
5712620	5713620	Well, let's hit him with searing light.
5713620	5714620	Okay.
5714620	5720920	Praying to your gods, you see a light open up in the heavens and a shaft of white light
5720920	5727620	pierces down from the sky and blasts directly into the devil's face.
5728620	5730620	Wow.
5730620	5732620	He's the devil?
5732620	5733620	He's a devil.
5733620	5734620	Okay, cool.
5734620	5738620	I wish we'd known that before we tried all these other weird tactics.
5738620	5740620	We thought he was Bob Fosse.
5740620	5742620	I thought he was like a rolled doll's BFD.
5742620	5743620	Yeah.
5744620	5748620	I was literally picturing Mecha McDonald walking around being like, hey, how's it going?
5748620	5749620	What's up?
5749620	5751620	I definitely said demon.
5751620	5754620	But when I said devil, you guys clued in.
5754620	5756620	I was like, oh, devil, not demon.
5756620	5758620	I'm just a normal human.
5758620	5759620	Okay.
5759620	5761620	Anyway, it does 16 damage.
5765620	5768620	Can you have a catch phrase like, you've been thrust?
5771620	5773620	Isn't that your name?
5773620	5774620	Thrust?
5774620	5777620	Yeah, but I'm not going to use that as a, it's almost like a come on.
5777620	5778620	All right.
5778620	5779620	Well, all right.
5779620	5780620	Well, you don't have to use it.
5780620	5781620	I'm sorry.
5781620	5783620	You've been thrust.
5783620	5784620	Write another song.
5784620	5785620	You've been thrust.
5785620	5786620	Can I have it?
5786620	5787620	You can have it.
5787620	5788620	Yeah, sure.
5788620	5789620	Sure.
5789620	5790620	Who's next, Spencer?
5790620	5792620	It would be Kumail's next.
5792620	5793620	All right.
5793620	5799620	Well, I, so if I become invisible, is that one turn or can I be invisible and then also
5799620	5800620	step?
5800620	5804620	You could do both, but you're too far away to get over to him right now.
5804620	5805620	Okay.
5805620	5807620	Well, so I do have a poison dagger.
5807620	5808620	Yep.
5809620	5810620	Shoot that poison dagger.
5810620	5816620	Or the short bow.
5816620	5817620	How about this?
5817620	5824620	I tie a rope to the poison dagger and I throw it.
5824620	5825620	God damn it.
5825620	5827620	Can we have an intervention?
5827620	5829620	Tying a rope?
5829620	5831620	Well, then I can pull it back.
5831620	5834620	I know why you do it.
5834620	5837620	I feel like it's my signature move at this point.
5837620	5839620	Has it ever worked?
5839620	5840620	Not yet.
5841620	5845620	Can you imagine a rope and a dagger and tying the rope to the dagger?
5845620	5847620	It's not just a, it's not like an Atari game.
5847620	5850620	No, it looks like Scorpion from Mortal Kombat.
5850620	5851620	Get over here.
5851620	5852620	It's cool.
5852620	5853620	It's cool.
5853620	5854620	Get over here.
5854620	5855620	I like it.
5855620	5857620	I think it's cool.
5857620	5860620	Except instead of, I say human thrust.
5863620	5864620	All right.
5864620	5865620	I just throw the knife at him.
5865620	5866620	Yeah.
5866620	5867620	Yeah.
5867620	5868620	You threw the knife.
5868620	5869620	Which is better?
5869620	5870620	I don't care.
5870620	5871620	Keep the rope on it, man.
5871620	5872620	Follow your heart.
5872620	5873620	You tell him.
5873620	5874620	Tell him, Spencer.
5874620	5880620	A rope would make a knife less accurate, but you would be able to reel it in.
5880620	5881620	How much less accurate?
5881620	5882620	Like minus two.
5882620	5885620	Oh, that's what the fuck it is.
5885620	5886620	Minus two?
5886620	5887620	Yeah.
5887620	5888620	I tie the rope.
5892620	5893620	Human thrust.
5895620	5896620	All right.
5896620	5897620	Well, yeah.
5897620	5902620	You tie and throw the dagger, and you strike the demon in the temple.
5902620	5903620	Oh, shit.
5903620	5905620	And he's Jewish?
5906620	5908620	Hello!
5912620	5913620	Okay.
5913620	5914620	Yeah.
5914620	5915620	Dealing two damage.
5915620	5916620	Two damage.
5916620	5917620	Two damage.
5917620	5920620	But it's a poison dagger, so it'll slowly work its way.
5920620	5922620	Devils are immune to poison.
5922620	5924620	Oh.
5925620	5930620	My dad ran into that same problem.
5930620	5931620	Oh, really?
5931620	5932620	Yeah, yeah.
5932620	5934620	I heard that still alive right now, Spencer.
5934620	5939620	If I dip it in like vitamin C, would that have hurt him?
5939620	5940620	No.
5940620	5941620	Okay.
5941620	5942620	All right.
5942620	5943620	Who's next?
5943620	5944620	Kumail Dan.
5944620	5946620	Yeah, we're just going this way.
5946620	5947620	All right.
5947620	5950620	Well, can I reach this guy with shock and grasp?
5950620	5951620	No.
5951620	5954620	You'd have to not be able to.
5954620	5956620	You have to.
5956620	5957620	All right.
5957620	5958620	Well, then I...
5958620	5959620	Why don't we approach him?
5959620	5960620	Let's close the distance.
5960620	5961620	Well, that's what I want to do.
5961620	5962620	Let's close the distance.
5962620	5963620	All right.
5963620	5964620	Fine.
5964620	5967620	I'm marching towards him, and I've got my arms crackling with ferocious electric energy.
5967620	5968620	And I go with him.
5968620	5972620	And I'm like, I said don't!
5972620	5975620	But you did!
5975620	5979620	Now I'm gonna!
5979620	5982620	Someone's going to get got!
5982620	5984620	That happens.
5984620	5989620	I'm throwing a glass of champagne behind him as his hype man.
5989620	5991620	Yeah, that happens.
5991620	5993620	Putting it at Mulrain's turn.
5993620	5994620	Okay.
5994620	5997620	I put four of my arrows in...
5997620	5999620	I weave them into my rope to make a necklace.
5999620	6001620	See what you do?
6001620	6003620	She's made a rope necklace.
6003620	6004620	A necklace of rope.
6004620	6005620	With arrows.
6005620	6008620	I made a necklace that I know will fit the devil's neck.
6008620	6014620	And I put arrows in it in a way that are like spikes on my necklace.
6014620	6015620	Like a collar.
6015620	6018620	Like a collar, but like bigger than a collar.
6018620	6021620	And as everyone knows, I make great rope necklaces.
6021620	6028620	So I run up to where Sharpie is, and I say, oh my god, I found her necklace.
6028620	6030620	Assuming that he'll be like, oh, my necklace.
6030620	6031620	And put it on.
6031620	6032620	To Sharpie?
6032620	6033620	Sorry?
6033620	6034620	To Sharpie?
6034620	6035620	No, no, no.
6035620	6036620	To the...
6036620	6037620	Devil.
6037620	6040620	Yeah, you're still too far off, but you could get that prepped.
6040620	6041620	Okay.
6041620	6043620	For when he's actually nearby.
6043620	6044620	Well...
6044620	6046620	But you know, he doesn't know who you are.
6046620	6047620	Can I run as I'm making it?
6047620	6048620	No, I know.
6048620	6051620	But if a stranger came up to me and they're like, oh, my god, you dropped your phone.
6051620	6052620	I'd be like, oh, thank you.
6052620	6055620	It was something you've never seen before in your life.
6055620	6060620	And it looked like a spikey murder necklace.
6060620	6061620	No, no, no.
6061620	6062620	He doesn't see the spikes.
6062620	6063620	He doesn't see the spikes.
6063620	6064620	They're woven in.
6064620	6065620	Love it.
6065620	6070620	The idea is that he will tie it on his neck and it will prick his neck and he'll bleed
6070620	6071620	out.
6071620	6072620	I'm on board.
6072620	6074620	And I'll be the victor.
6074620	6076620	You made a pact with this?
6076620	6077620	Yeah.
6077620	6081620	I made a pact, so I run up and I go, look, this sounds like a bunch of horseshit, but
6081620	6083620	I'm with you all the way, Maureen.
6083620	6087620	If I can help you in any way with this necklace gambit, I'm there.
6087620	6088620	Okay, you absolutely can.
6088620	6090620	I'll make it and I'm going to give it to you so you can deliver it.
6090620	6091620	You got it.
6091620	6092620	You're next.
6092620	6093620	I'm with you.
6094620	6097620	Okay, so I just make it and I give it to my friend Quark.
6097620	6102620	So you could also travel up his body and put it around his neck.
6102620	6103620	I made a pact.
6103620	6105620	You tell me what to do and it's done.
6105620	6107620	I really like the, oh, you lost this.
6107620	6108620	I like that one.
6108620	6111620	Well, I mean, you just have to say it confidently.
6111620	6113620	I'll give it, do it in whatever method you want.
6113620	6118620	You think this is better coming from a barbarian gnome than a woman?
6118620	6122620	I mean, you're a nice looking gnome.
6122620	6123620	Well, thank you.
6123620	6124620	Thank you.
6124620	6126620	It's very nice of you to say.
6126620	6127620	So I got the necklace.
6127620	6130620	Well, if a woman did it and they had the right music, I'm counting it.
6130620	6131620	Okay, I'm going to go up to...
6131620	6134620	I mean, I don't think I'm in this guy's market.
6134620	6136620	I'm a barbarian and I fly off in a barbarian range.
6136620	6140620	I have my orders and I run up to the demon and I go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
6140620	6142620	Excuse me, gentlemen.
6142620	6144620	How do you do?
6144620	6146620	It seems to me that you might have dropped something.
6146620	6148620	A necklace about your size?
6148620	6150620	Is this your necklace?
6151620	6153620	Ignore the spikes.
6153620	6156620	I mean, thank you so much.
6156620	6159620	I look back tomorrow and I go, how am I doing?
6159620	6160620	I just, thank you.
6160620	6161620	Okay, kind of.
6161620	6162620	We made a pact.
6162620	6163620	Thank you so much.
6163620	6164620	I love it.
6164620	6165620	Okay.
6165620	6166620	I assume he dies.
6166620	6168620	No, no, no.
6168620	6169620	Spencer.
6169620	6173620	Yeah, he shoots two fireballs, one of which hits Quark.
6173620	6175620	Spencer.
6175620	6182620	How much damage did it do?
6182620	6185620	Six damage to Quark and...
6185620	6186620	Wait, we don't know.
6186620	6188620	Did the devil fall for it?
6188620	6191620	Nine damage to Roy.
6191620	6193620	How did he get involved in this?
6193620	6195620	He doesn't speak common.
6195620	6197620	What sort of damage did I sustain?
6197620	6199620	You took six.
6199620	6200620	To what part of my body?
6200620	6201620	To the face.
6201620	6203620	Fire to the face.
6204620	6209620	I turned back to Mulrain with my face on fire.
6209620	6210620	Your eyebrows are gone.
6210620	6212620	My eyebrows are gone.
6212620	6217620	And I look back and I take some of the soot off of my hair
6217620	6222620	and I draw happy eyebrows on my forehead.
6222620	6225620	And I go, it was worth it!
6225620	6234620	Oh boy, I'm too busy making another necklace to notice.
6234620	6237620	Wow, this is a great pact.
6237620	6238620	No, no.
6238620	6241620	And then I look up and I feel very bad.
6241620	6242620	Spencer.
6242620	6243620	Okay.
6243620	6247620	So let's make him do stuff by saying his name like that.
6247620	6249620	I'm not trying to make him do anything.
6249620	6251620	He's writing the story.
6251620	6253620	You wrote the story that's ineffective.
6253620	6254620	No, no, no.
6254620	6255620	We don't break the fourth wall.
6255620	6256620	We're in it.
6256620	6257620	He's rolling the dice.
6257620	6258620	There's no story.
6258620	6259620	That's just what's happening.
6259620	6260620	You think because you made him a lasagna
6260620	6261620	that he's going to roll higher numbers for you?
6261620	6262620	I didn't know what you were talking about.
6262620	6264620	Rolls had nothing to do with this.
6264620	6265620	Spencer, did she bribe you with lasagna?
6265620	6267620	No, she just gives me food.
6267620	6268620	She's a feeder.
6268620	6271620	And it's delicious.
6271620	6273620	She's a feeder.
6273620	6275620	She makes people food.
6275620	6276620	But Erin, do you expect-
6276620	6277620	Is that Jerry Seinfeld?
6277620	6279620	Do you expect-
6279620	6281620	She's a feeder.
6282620	6284620	Erin, do you expect higher rolls from Spencer
6284620	6286620	when you apply him with treats?
6286620	6287620	No, no, no, I don't.
6287620	6288620	I think I-
6288620	6289620	I think you do.
6289620	6290620	No, no, I don't.
6290620	6293620	Let's take this from a real world perspective.
6293620	6296620	I don't have a baby, but I have a point where a baby would be,
6296620	6298620	and I filled it with Spencer.
6298620	6301620	An incarnation of the demon appears in front of you,
6301620	6302620	Erin McGathey.
6302620	6303620	This is not of this world.
6303620	6305620	You've never seen anything like it.
6305620	6307620	Its skin is crackling and ashen.
6307620	6309620	There's molten lava in its eyes.
6310620	6314620	And you offer it a rope tied in a knot.
6314620	6316620	Would it be, oh, thank you, or would it be,
6316620	6320620	I'm a demon here to slay the souls of the living.
6320620	6321620	I'm going to keep doing that,
6321620	6324620	regardless of strings or knots or necklaces.
6324620	6327620	I mean, here's a real question.
6327620	6332620	Do demons just have no insecurity like they do?
6332620	6333620	I mean, I really-
6333620	6335620	Do they not accessorize?
6335620	6337620	No, they're tortured.
6337620	6338620	They're tortured, creatures.
6339620	6340620	My face is on fire.
6340620	6341620	Kindness.
6341620	6342620	No, they'd be all like,
6342620	6345620	I came to this plane to murder people.
6345620	6348620	I enslaved all the people that look like this person,
6348620	6349620	all these human ones.
6349620	6350620	I apologize.
6350620	6352620	I just assumed that every creature
6352620	6354620	had some sort of soft spot.
6354620	6355620	But I apologize.
6355620	6356620	Demon.
6357620	6359620	What does that mean to any of you?
6359620	6360620	Demon.
6360620	6362620	Do you guys know what demons are?
6362620	6363620	Yeah.
6363620	6367620	Spencer, I went in there with the necklace
6367620	6372620	to prove a point about pacts and about demons.
6372620	6374620	Yeah, you guys are all playing your characters
6374620	6375620	very accurately.
6375620	6377620	I run back to Morwen if it's still my turn.
6377620	6378620	Do I have a turn to do this or no?
6378620	6379620	Yeah, it's your turn again.
6379620	6380620	He threw the fireball.
6380620	6382620	Okay, I run back to Morwen and go,
6382620	6384620	your turn and I-
6384620	6385620	Wait, but it's his turn.
6385620	6386620	Uh-huh.
6386620	6387620	Oh, okay.
6387620	6388620	Well, you're next.
6388620	6389620	And the next time,
6389620	6393620	I'm going to make you a little friendship bracelet for him.
6393620	6394620	At the very least,
6394620	6398620	the demon is going to remember this battle.
6398620	6400620	When he's in the demon lounge.
6400620	6403620	You're not going to believe who I killed today.
6403620	6404620	Can we backtrack?
6404620	6406620	I mean, I know I made him a necklace,
6406620	6408620	but can we remember the time when someone initiated
6408620	6410620	a tap dance for the demon?
6410620	6411620	It wasn't a tap dance.
6411620	6414620	We were 150 feet away by the time and it seemed like-
6414620	6416620	And that didn't work either.
6416620	6417620	Thank you for doing that.
6417620	6418620	I would appreciate it.
6418620	6419620	I'm kidding about that.
6419620	6420620	I run back and I go,
6420620	6421620	it didn't work.
6421620	6422620	Oh my God.
6422620	6423620	That was a shitty idea.
6423620	6424620	I'm sorry.
6424620	6425620	Did I do it wrong?
6425620	6426620	Uh-
6426620	6427620	Oh.
6427620	6429620	How's that pack working out for you?
6429620	6430620	The what?
6430620	6431620	The pack.
6431620	6432620	How's that working out?
6432620	6433620	So far, it stinks.
6433620	6434620	Okay.
6434620	6435620	We have a pretty good pack here.
6435620	6436620	I stab Roy in the chest.
6436620	6437620	What the fuck?
6437620	6438620	With my dagger.
6438620	6443620	Over and over again, I stab him in the chest
6443620	6445620	because I'm thirsty for blood.
6445620	6446620	Ours doesn't involve necklaces.
6446620	6447620	Wow.
6447620	6448620	Okay.
6448620	6449620	Well, we have an opening in the pack.
6449620	6450620	Yeah, we do.
6450620	6452620	We don't have necklaces or arrows or anything like that.
6452620	6453620	And we don't get our faces burned off.
6453620	6454620	You know what?
6454620	6455620	No more packs for me.
6455620	6456620	I'm going slow.
6456620	6457620	Well, I tell you what.
6457620	6459620	You join us and I can cure that face wound to yours.
6459620	6461620	Let's find out how you being stabbed in the chest works out.
6461620	6462620	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6462620	6463620	Well, I-
6463620	6464620	His name's Slavin' Shaq.
6464620	6465620	I stab him in the face.
6465620	6467620	He takes eight damage to the face.
6467620	6469620	Oh, is that what we're doing?
6469620	6470620	Yeah.
6470620	6471620	This is-
6471620	6472620	All right.
6472620	6474620	This is a great-
6474620	6476620	It's a blood that comes from his face
6476620	6481620	because I take the blood and I paint a picture of his family dying on my horse.
6482620	6484620	This is a great story for the demon.
6484620	6485620	Yeah, it was.
6485620	6488620	These people I easily slaughtered today.
6488620	6490620	Wait till you hear about this.
6490620	6491620	Mulrain.
6491620	6494620	Mulrain, why are you attacking Slap Squad?
6494620	6495620	I don't know.
6495620	6496620	I have a feeling.
6496620	6497620	What is your feeling?
6497620	6498620	Your feeling is what?
6498620	6499620	I don't know.
6499620	6500620	It's negative.
6500620	6501620	I'd like-
6501620	6503620	I want to drink his blood and draw pictures with it.
6503620	6504620	Whatever, guys.
6504620	6506620	We are having fun, right?
6506620	6508620	Not Slap Squad.
6508620	6512620	Okay, so I'll ignore the painful evisceration of my face,
6512620	6517620	and I will cure Cork's serious wounds.
6517620	6519620	Thank you, Slap Squad.
6519620	6520620	You're welcome.
6520620	6522620	Cork goes back to full health.
6522620	6524620	Doo, doo, doo, doo.
6524620	6525620	Yeah.
6525620	6526620	Remember, one left.
6526620	6527620	Packed.
6527620	6528620	One place.
6528620	6529620	Okay, I'm in your pact.
6529620	6530620	Okay.
6530620	6531620	Putting it in.
6531620	6532620	Christoper's turn.
6532620	6533620	Okay, all right.
6533620	6539620	Well, I reel the knife back in.
6539620	6542620	This is the payoff.
6542620	6544620	That happens.
6544620	6546620	Is it still attached to his head?
6546620	6548620	Does he get closer to us like Scorpion?
6548620	6549620	No.
6549620	6550620	No?
6550620	6551620	All right.
6551620	6553620	I point at it while it's being reeled back in.
6553620	6556620	Like I'm a reaction shot in a 1980s commercial
6556620	6559620	for the rope tied to a knife.
6559620	6560620	Whoa!
6560620	6561620	This is pretty cool, right?
6561620	6562620	What's that?
6562620	6564620	I want my dagger back, dagger back, dagger back.
6564620	6565620	I thought he threw that knife.
6565620	6566620	Yeah.
6566620	6567620	Now it's going back.
6567620	6568620	It's a knife rope.
6568620	6569620	I want my dagger back, dagger back, dagger back.
6569620	6570620	Knife rope.
6570620	6571620	Rope sold separately.
6571620	6572620	Does not include knife.
6572620	6573620	Does not include knife.
6573620	6574620	All rope.
6574620	6575620	May cause cancer.
6575620	6586620	I take my short bow, and I just fucking shoot it at this guy.
6586620	6590620	I just fucking shoot it at this guy.
6590620	6592620	You miss.
6592620	6594620	Sorry.
6594620	6596620	The knife rope was way better.
6596620	6597620	Yeah, yeah.
6597620	6598620	I should stick with my thing.
6598620	6599620	All right, Sharpie.
6599620	6600620	Sharpie.
6600620	6603620	This was like when Michael Jordan tried to play baseball.
6603620	6604620	Sharpie.
6604620	6606620	So I was marching toward him.
6606620	6607620	Yeah, yeah.
6607620	6608620	You're close.
6608620	6613620	I'm telling you, with my arms wreathed in, crackling electronic energy,
6613620	6618620	preparing shocking grasp, thinking about all of my father's abuse of me,
6618620	6623620	and just locking eyes with him and just going,
6623620	6626620	I told you don't.
6626620	6633620	Now you will be grasped.
6633620	6637620	I think your catchphrase needs a little bit of work.
6637620	6641620	I'm starting to like that thrust catchphrase.
6641620	6648620	Dealing 19 damage.
6648620	6652620	The electricity pulses through his body, and he shakes violently,
6652620	6656620	and you see his eyes pop and ooze and liquefy out of his face.
6656620	6662620	He falls to the ground and dissipates into a black fog that drifts away.
6662620	6664620	Whoa.
6664620	6667620	We did it.
6667620	6668620	That's Hermit, everybody.
6668620	6672620	Thank you for coming.
6672620	6673620	Good job, Roy.
6673620	6675620	You did great this time.
6675620	6676620	That was better.
6676620	6680620	Roy McClerg, everybody.
6680620	6685620	Mr. Aaron McGathey, Camille Nangiani, and Spencer Crittenden, as always.
6685620	6690620	Also, Connor, we'll see you next week for the teleportation versus sex.
6690620	6695620	And thank you, Sikh Donnelly, for the artwork, and Samantha, for the lovely keychains.
6695620	6696620	I'm Jeff Davis.
6696620	6699620	One more time for Dan Herman, your mayor, everybody.
