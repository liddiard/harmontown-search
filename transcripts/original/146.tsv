0	21120	Welcome, Bridgetown, from the Bridgetown Comedy Festival in Portland, Oregon, Carminetown
21120	24120	is now in Sussex.
25120	26120	Oh, yeah.
34120	40120	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
45120	46120	Hello, thank you.
55120	56120	Thank you.
56120	58120	Oh, family.
63120	64120	Thank you.
64120	70120	Jeff, when you warm up the crowd when we go to Portland, and you talk about how great Portland is,
70120	74120	and you ask them how long they've been in Portland, what do you think I'm going to talk to them about?
74120	75120	You're doing my act.
75120	76120	I don't have an act.
76120	78120	I don't do magic tricks.
78120	80120	That was half my act.
80120	81120	I love Portland.
81120	86120	I'm glad you're warmed up, but now I've got nothing.
86120	89120	Portland can bear both of our love, Dan.
89120	90120	Oh, it can.
90120	91120	It can bear everybody's.
91120	92120	It's a wonderful town.
92120	94120	What's your favorite thing about Portland, Oregon?
94120	101120	I love the feeling of ass kiss exhaustion, of loving a city so much that you get mad.
101120	105120	Like, fucking fuck Portland.
105120	109120	Every time Aaron and I come here, we extend our stay by a couple more days,
109120	113120	and we're constantly, like, I'm sure every person from Los Angeles talks about moving here.
113120	114120	I'm sure.
114120	119120	We have to be typical, and so we keep staying here longer and longer
119120	122120	because we just want to get mad at something.
122120	126120	We've got to find out what these people are bad at.
126120	128120	What are you bad at?
128120	129120	Parallel parking.
129120	131120	Parallel parking, okay.
131120	133120	Yeah, okay.
133120	135120	I'll believe it.
135120	137120	What is the worst thing about being in Portland?
137120	141120	Is there a thing that you guys are known for being shitty at besides parallel parking?
141120	145120	Merging asshole drivers.
145120	147120	Passive aggression.
147120	148120	That's very interesting.
148120	156120	Some girl pointed at somebody else and said, passive aggression.
156120	163120	Passive aggression, and then they nod their head like, tell him, Kevin, what do you mean?
163120	166120	Fucking Kevin, he's the worst.
166120	170120	It's a yogurt shop that won't let anyone in unless they turn off their phone.
170120	172120	You guys love yogurt still, right?
172120	174120	It's still 1993.
174120	177120	And Seattle.
177120	182120	If there's anything, like, I'm telling you now, I'm kind of a Portland expert in one degree
182120	186120	because I want to ask because I'm only ever walking around your town,
186120	192120	so four or five visits to Portland, I feel comfortable saying their homeless population is very distinct.
193120	199120	In San Francisco, the homeless population is like, I think they're like Mad Max homeless people
199120	203120	because who doesn't want to be a homeless guy in San Francisco?
203120	210120	It's high stakes, so they're actually like people who could own homes here or in LA.
210120	215120	When you become homeless, you want to be in San Francisco so that you feel less homeless.
215120	221120	So the homeless people in San Francisco have garbage can lids for vests.
221120	224120	And they have, like, gimmicks, like they do card tricks.
224120	227120	It's a fucking racket, man. It's like a full-time job.
227120	231120	I was walking down the road here on East Burnside, and is that where we are? Right?
231120	233120	Thank you. Wow.
233120	235120	They're sharp. It's 4 p.m., by the way.
235120	240120	We're not going to be funny at 4 p.m., but you guys are going to be very, like, on your shit.
240120	243120	I want three cups of coffee. Yep, yep, yep, yep.
243120	248120	The comedy rule is that nothing's funny when the sun's out, but we're in Portland, so the sun's never out, so it's perfect.
248120	255120	I was walking up the road to, just right here by Sizzle Pie, and there were two, just good and proper homeless dudes.
255120	263120	Like, there were two guys hanging out, like, kind of middle-aged white guys that looked like your proper art department winos, and I was...
263120	267120	They're very well-designed homeless people you guys have here.
267120	272120	They have, like, cool tattoos, dogs. We got Steve Agee laughing like the Phantom of the Opera out there.
272120	279120	Oh, no!
279120	281120	I thought you were dead!
281120	287120	I forgot we got...
287120	291120	So, I was walking down the road to go get some Sizzle Pie, which I quite enjoy.
291120	298120	And these two guys were sitting there in a doorway, like, lurking, and just, like, kind of supine and sharing a beer.
298120	304120	And a guy started to, like, gesture to me and say something, under normal circumstances.
304120	308120	That would be, uh, brother, can you spare a dime? Have you got any spare change? Kind of stuff.
308120	311120	He goes, nice coat, man.
311120	313120	Oh, my God!
313120	316120	He didn't want shit! He wanted to fucking enjoy my coat!
316120	321120	I've been getting that for three days! Aaron got me this At-At shirt, the Star Wars At-At shirt.
321120	325120	Okay, so they're faking it. Because they're, like, cool shirt, bro.
325120	328120	Were they just here in the doorway, just on the block, right here?
328120	333120	Well, I don't...everywhere. No, multiple homeless people loved my At-At shirt.
333120	339120	No, they didn't. They're Portland homeless people, and you guys are secretly vain.
339120	342120	And they are...this is the biosphere. We're just learning this now.
342120	347120	They're, like, living on the methane of this ocean floor, because there's no sun.
347120	351120	So they're, like, okay, compliment their hair and their shirt.
352120	356120	That's the difference between a Portland homeless guy that lives to see a homeless tomorrow...
356120	359120	Even the homeless people are passive-aggressive here.
359120	363120	Oh, wow. Nice expensive coat you've got there.
363120	365120	But I saw that.
365120	370120	I guess I'll just sit here in the shade and, like, be in a puddle for the rest of my life.
370120	373120	They're more packed up, too, though. They're less solo.
373120	375120	I'm gonna strike out a theory that's just from the...
375120	377120	I'm sure you guys are sick of being characterized as, like,
377120	381120	wonderfuls than people and, like, liberal and wonderful and nurturing.
381120	385120	There's probably some small part of you that's driving home at night and going, like,
385120	389120	why don't out-of-towners just understand that I'm fucked up, too?
389120	393120	Just because I can hold a city together doesn't mean I'm a fucking...
393120	397120	I'm this highway to heaven for you when you're coming out of town.
397120	402120	But I'm telling you, I mean, you guys, to the extent that you are Portland,
402120	407120	I mean, you guys are pretty infuriatingly cool and hard to upset.
407120	409120	You're very nice to out-of-towners.
409120	412120	But there was a guy...
412120	413120	I don't know if I can even...
413120	417120	I have no idea if he was homeless, but he was definitely strange.
417120	421120	And he was a middle-aged guy, and he was holding a skateboard.
421120	423120	I immediately wrote this down.
423120	426120	The last time I was in Portland, I feel like I had an encounter that I had to immediately write down
426120	428120	because, like, they asked for money.
428120	431120	I would have to scroll back through our backlog to hear that because I told the story.
431120	433120	They asked for a couple years ago.
433120	436120	They asked for money, and I think I gave them money.
436120	438120	And then they said, like, thank you.
438120	439120	We're crackheads.
439120	445120	And then some weird, like, kind of flourish, like, you got to be careful out here.
445120	448120	I can't remember what it was, but anyways.
448120	450120	But I remember writing a encounter presenting the show.
450120	455120	And then again, it happened because this middle-aged guy who had, like, a kind of riff-raff
455120	459120	from Rocky Horror kind of hair style,
459120	467120	and he was holding a skateboard, and he was dressed with, like, a heavy metal concert goer kind of closed,
467120	472120	but, like, also kind of fucked up like he's seen a couple nights into a bridge.
472120	476120	But he's holding a skateboard, and had the riff-raff hair, and was, like, my age.
476120	481120	And as we passed each other, when I was eight feet from him, he said,
481120	482120	do you have a cigarette?
482120	485120	So I had four feet to say, no, I don't, sorry.
486120	491120	And then as he passed me, even though neither of us slowed down, he said,
491120	494120	do you have any Mortal Kombat stuff?
502120	505120	Please tell me you said yes.
505120	509120	Well, I have to stress, though, that it was, like, I was, then I was four feet, eight feet apart.
509120	512120	And I just, but commenced 30 years of head scratching that'll never,
512120	517120	this is why I need to believe in God, because I need to believe that these moments will be explained to me.
517120	522120	That guy, he was, he was, he wanted to, he had, he was, he just got kicked out of his place,
522120	526120	and he had a bag full of Mortal Kombat, like, stuff, and he just wanted to sell you stuff.
526120	527120	And I'm like, oh, good.
527120	531120	And then God says, like, plus you had eight spiders in your mouth.
531120	532120	Any more trivia you want to know?
532120	534120	Yes, like, lots of stuff.
534120	538120	Like, you can spend 500 years analyzing the 57 years I'm going to be here.
538120	544120	I got in the car from my from my hotel or my hotel, which is like, you know, like a short, a decent walk from here.
544120	545120	And I was getting a ride over here.
545120	549120	And there was a guy on the road carrying a skateboard.
549120	553120	And I think it was a guy because he looked like me if he had a skateboard.
553120	559120	If I was walking down the street with a skateboard and wasn't wearing a suit, my height, my kind of like haircut, like my build.
559120	563120	And yet, perfect tits.
563120	566120	It was a guy that was clearly a guy.
566120	569120	And he had like beautiful bouncing boobs in his shirts.
569120	571120	And he was just cruising down the road with a skateboard.
571120	576120	I'm like, that's a good town.
576120	581120	Jeff Davis with delicious double D is walking down the road.
581120	586120	That's specific enough that that guy's probably listening, I think, and knows.
586120	589120	So call in.
589120	592120	I want to speaking of like reaching out to specific fans and like wondering things.
592120	596120	I had a strange because I caught myself doing something so odd today.
596120	597120	I don't wonder.
597120	600120	I know that there's differently abled Harman town fans.
600120	607120	I don't know if there's any here tonight, but like specifically wheelchair using folk.
607120	609120	That's the term, right?
609120	611120	Nailed it.
611120	614120	So frightened of everything now.
614120	621120	And it expresses itself so much more the bigot sounding wheelchair using folk.
622120	623120	You're great.
623120	624120	You're Ellen Aldo.
624120	627120	You're nailing it.
627120	630120	I passed a guy in a wheelchair and I caught myself.
630120	636120	This is the first time in 42 years I was conscious of my behavior because I wonder if any differently
636120	641120	abled Harmanians, like have you ever, do you constantly experience something that I would
641120	647120	call the wheelchair smile from non-differently abled people?
647120	650120	Because I made this weird face.
650120	659120	This very polite kind of like, what did I mean by that face?
659120	660120	Nice wheelchair?
660120	662120	What did I mean?
662120	664120	What does that face mean?
664120	666120	And I wonder if people that are bound.
666120	667120	Nice folks.
667120	668120	Yeah.
668120	669120	What does that face mean?
669120	672120	I bet it makes them feel like living ghosts and makes them very upset because it's not
672120	673120	a natural face.
673120	676120	Why can't you just see me as a human being, you fat piece of shit?
677120	679120	Welcome to Portland.
679120	681120	I'm the only angry person in Portland.
681120	687120	Dan, let's say, God forbid, that you like had some accident or some debilitating illness
687120	688120	that made you...
688120	690120	Sooner than it will inevitably happen, yes.
690120	695120	That you were wheelchair bound and you were going down the road or hearing a crowd.
695120	697120	What look would you like to get from other people?
697120	701120	Well, obviously, I would like, I mean, it's not a funny answer, but I would like no look.
701120	705120	I would like, yeah, we all remember, well, we don't all remember.
705120	709120	You're 22.
709120	710120	This was the 80s definition.
710120	711120	I've referenced this before.
711120	716120	The 80s definition of political correctness was on different strokes when Arnold was introduced
716120	717120	to a kid in a wheelchair.
717120	722120	Every sitcom back then had one episode about a kid in a wheelchair, and I think they got
722120	725120	money from London or something if they did it.
725120	729120	It's the handicap capital of the world.
729120	730120	None of this makes sense.
730120	731120	It's four in the afternoon.
731120	732120	I'm already drunk.
732120	734120	Just suffer through this.
734120	735120	Hey, Avalon.
735120	736120	Hey, how are you doing, buddy?
736120	738120	Let's talk about Avalon in a second.
738120	745120	And then we'll have guests and we'll do a show.
745120	749120	Arnold Jackson, that was his name, Gary Coleman's character in Different Strokes.
749120	753120	He befriends a kid in a wheelchair and they have a play date.
753120	757120	And then he, I think Arnold refuses the call to adventure.
757120	759120	He's like, I don't want to be friends with a guy in a wheelchair.
759120	760120	That's uncomfortable.
760120	763120	And then the road to trials is they share action figures or something and they're making friends
763120	767120	and then Arnold says, come on, I want to show you my goldfish.
767120	768120	Let's go upstairs.
768120	773120	And he runs up the stairs and then stops halfway up the stairs and turns back around and looks
773120	777120	at the kid in the wheelchair and says, I'm sorry, I forgot you were.
777120	783120	And then the kid in the wheelchair, like half for the narrative but mostly for the planet,
783120	790120	goes, Arnold, that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.
791120	796120	And the audience applauds instead of laughing, which is how you know it's the 80s when a sitcom
796120	801120	could get a pause for not being funny.
801120	808120	Because it's like there were three channels and it was secretly socialist, like a fascist regime.
808120	811120	It was like dividing 200 million people three ways.
811120	815120	And as I've already pointed out, every year they'd have a battle of the network of stars
815120	817120	that was like, the Hulk is fighting the bionic woman.
817120	818120	They're from different networks.
818120	820120	Go fuck yourself.
820120	822120	This isn't capitalism.
822120	823120	What are you going to do?
823120	826120	Take your TV watching elsewhere?
826120	829120	So anyways, and now we don't know what to do.
829120	831120	Now we're like, how do you be a human?
831120	835120	And we're trying to learn because I don't think that's a person in a wheelchair's fantasy
835120	840120	is for someone to go halfway upstairs and then say, I forgot you were.
840120	843120	That's not their fantasy.
844120	848120	That doesn't make their day.
848120	855120	Avalon is this guy in this powder blue sport jacket, which you were wearing when I met you.
855120	858120	Homeless.
858120	861120	This is the city for it.
861120	867120	I'm not going to re-deliver this right, but when I met him, a very friendly guy, huge fan
867120	870120	and very nice.
870120	873120	I asked his name and he said Avalon.
873120	882120	So to demonstrate the timing because it requires overlap, I'll be Avalon.
882120	885120	You ask me my name, I'll tell you Avalon.
885120	888120	I want to be Avalon.
888120	889120	I can't be Avalon.
889120	890120	You can't be Avalon.
890120	892120	You have to be me for a second.
893120	900120	So I'll tell you my name is Avalon and then you hear the name and react to it.
900120	903120	React as you would have reacted or as anybody would react.
903120	906120	Yeah, but just by repeating the name, puzzle through it.
906120	907120	Okay.
907120	909120	And I'll do what he did.
909120	910120	It's very nice to meet you.
910120	912120	My name is Avalon.
912120	915120	My mother thought she was having a stripper.
918120	921120	That's what he said while I was going, Avalon?
922120	923120	Very charming.
924120	927120	Sometimes having a pat response to something is very not charming.
927120	929120	Why don't you live in the moment?
929120	930120	But your name is Avalon.
930120	934120	To have a fucking calling card like that, that's very charming.
935120	937120	All right, Avalon, that's it.
937120	938120	Flush.
940120	941120	That's it.
943120	944120	That's it.
945120	952120	Avalon, is there a story to your name or is it just a name your parents thought was groovy?
955120	956120	Oh, okay.
956120	957120	Yeah, that's how old we are.
957120	958120	It was like Avalon.
958120	959120	Yeah.
959120	962120	He said, I think my parents like listening to Roxy music and fucking.
964120	965120	I don't know.
965120	966120	It's like, yeah.
966120	967120	Oh, God.
967120	968120	Avalon's a cool name.
968120	969120	I like that.
969120	971120	Music I still listen to is classic.
972120	973120	All right.
973120	976120	A couple more questions and I want to bring up a friend that I met last night.
977120	980120	Are we doing an hour, an hour and a half or two hours?
980120	981120	Does anyone know?
981120	982120	Well, I know you guys.
982120	984120	It's not up to you guys.
985120	986120	You guys don't work here.
987120	989120	How much do you want your tickets to be worth?
990120	992120	More, more.
992120	995120	Because God knows I'm great in that last half hour.
996120	998120	That's when it gets really good.
998120	1001120	I'm just worried the ghost of Steve Agee will kill us at one point.
1002120	1004120	Well, you know, that's not Steve Agee.
1004120	1005120	He's not here.
1005120	1006120	That's the ghost of.
1009120	1010120	Oh, no.
1011120	1013120	That's the ghost of Count Basanova.
1016120	1020120	He's he died during a long, long set by a bad comic.
1021120	1024120	We're going to bring Steve Agee down because we have we have I have a topic.
1024120	1026120	I want to address later on in the show.
1026120	1027120	OK, maybe.
1027120	1029120	OK, so OK, just a couple of random thoughts.
1029120	1033120	OK, so when you guys are walking in Portland, because there's a lot of joggers,
1034120	1041120	does everyone is this an abused child thing or when you're walking when you're walking on the sidewalk?
1041120	1044120	This is Dan's how you know you're a redneck sketch.
1050120	1055120	If you're only nice to people for the first three months, you know,
1056120	1058120	you might be an abused child.
1059120	1063120	The more you punish them, your father might have thrown you around like a ragdoll.
1065120	1066120	Hilarious.
1068120	1079120	When you're walking down the sidewalk and you hear a jogger behind you, do you is your first interpretation of their feet on the pavement and the rhythm of it.
1079120	1084120	Do you first before your consciousness has time to reinterpret it.
1084120	1092120	Do you think that they have a baseball bat and they're about to kill you or is that like some mild PTSD that I have?
1093120	1094120	Well, I'm walking down the sidewalk.
1094120	1100120	I've had somebody joggers come up behind me while I'm on my way to another drink and because it's jogging time.
1100120	1103120	It's nine a.m. and I'm like, oh, my father's place is open.
1105120	1107120	And it was because it's Mother's Day.
1110120	1112120	I was the most charming thing I've ever seen.
1112120	1113120	No one in L.A. has mothers.
1113120	1120120	The only mothers in L.A. are sitting in a dark living room watching their old movies and smoking themselves to death and their children moved away.
1123120	1125120	It's nice to be in a city with moms on Mother's Day.
1125120	1129120	I walked into my father's place and it's like it's a dive bar, but it has a restaurant attached.
1129120	1134120	It used to be a truck stop and every booth was filled with clearly like I was like, there's a mom, there's a mom.
1134120	1138120	Like they're a little dressed up and they went to a dive bar and had a good breakfast.
1139120	1140120	I hate Portland.
1141120	1143120	Fucking rubbing it in our faces.
1143120	1144120	It's like the homeschooled kid.
1144120	1146120	You're the homeschooled kid of the nation.
1148120	1150120	You don't understand how the world works.
1153120	1154120	Learn social cues.
1156120	1157120	What's wrong with you?
1157120	1160120	You're technically nice, but God damn it at what price.
1162120	1163120	Get more dogs.
1165120	1166120	Sarcasm.
1167120	1168120	I want to come here for my dogs.
1169120	1170120	Okay, jogging bats out.
1172120	1178120	I ran into a couple of stupid people here, but they're from LA.
1180120	1191120	I came up with a new technique and every time I talk to a stupid person so I don't get mad, I'm going to think of them as a really smart animal.
1194120	1196120	They say something and you're like, why would you say that?
1196120	1197120	Why would you ask me about that?
1197120	1203120	And then you're like, wow, because you're a super smart dog, an amazing dolphin.
1205120	1206120	All right, that's it.
1206120	1210120	That's all I got for my little dumb quasi stand up segment.
1211120	1212120	Let's break Steve Agee out to the crowd.
1212120	1213120	Shall we?
1213120	1214120	Steve Agee!
1218120	1222120	The Phantom of the Opera is here.
1222120	1225120	Hey, Tori, is that mine?
1225120	1228120	Oh, I was going to ask Tori for a drink.
1228120	1229120	Oh, no.
1229120	1230120	Oh, no.
1230120	1231120	Are you?
1231120	1232120	I didn't see.
1232120	1233120	I turned one way.
1233120	1234120	Are you okay?
1234120	1235120	Okay.
1235120	1236120	Tori, everybody.
1236120	1237120	She's been...
1237120	1238120	Tori.
1240120	1241120	Steve Agee, everybody.
1242120	1243120	Wait, is this water?
1244120	1245120	Sure.
1245120	1246120	Okay.
1246120	1247120	All right.
1247120	1248120	I think...
1248120	1249120	I was going to...
1249120	1250120	Yeah, okay.
1251120	1252120	Tracing dicks.
1253120	1254120	Tracing dicks.
1254120	1256120	It's a nerd poker reference.
1256120	1257120	Oh, okay.
1257120	1258120	How are you doing, Agee?
1258120	1259120	Pretty good.
1259120	1261120	You enjoy Portland, Oregon?
1261120	1262120	I love it.
1262120	1263120	I've been here a week.
1263120	1264120	Yeah?
1264120	1265120	Yeah.
1265120	1266120	What's your highlight?
1266120	1268120	A lot of marijuana.
1269120	1272120	I was going to say drugs, but that sounds like everything, but marijuana.
1272120	1274120	Sounds like the highlight almost erases itself.
1274120	1275120	Yeah.
1275120	1276120	What's the big highlight?
1277120	1278120	White joint.
1279120	1280120	White joint?
1280120	1281120	White joint.
1283120	1284120	Like you almost couldn't...
1284120	1286120	Racist drugs.
1287120	1289120	I think we talked about this where we brought it up recently in a harm in town.
1289120	1291120	The idea of the super cool, remember that?
1291120	1292120	Does anyone ever do that anymore?
1292120	1294120	Where you fucking put PCP in a joint?
1295120	1296120	One person.
1297120	1298120	It's called super cool?
1298120	1299120	A super cool.
1299120	1300120	That sounds super cool.
1302120	1304120	My friend Fran did a super cool outside of Jabberjaw.
1304120	1305120	Did you ever go to that?
1305120	1306120	Yeah.
1306120	1312120	It was a great rock and roll venue in kind of a shitty part of LA on Arlington and Pico.
1312120	1317120	And Jabberjaw and Bikini Kill and all the kind of power, like Carp and stuff like that, Unwound.
1317120	1318120	Really great bands.
1318120	1323120	And you could go there and you could buy a joint from a guy in the corner, but the joint usually had PCP in it.
1324120	1327120	And then you'd watch one of your friends have a fucking nervous breakdown in front of you.
1327120	1328120	Ugh.
1328120	1333120	There's always those drugs when the only time you hear about them is when someone's explaining why something fucked up happened.
1333120	1335120	In like movies and stuff, so you always wonder.
1335120	1337120	You go like, why would anyone ever do a speedball?
1337120	1339120	I only ever hear about it when someone dies.
1340120	1343120	But there must be like a version of a speedball where it's really fun.
1345120	1346120	You probably do a speedball twice.
1346120	1348120	The first time worked, the second time didn't work.
1349120	1353120	I'm going to Bogota, Colombia to shoot something and someone was telling me.
1353120	1354120	To shoot what, Steve?
1354120	1355120	To shoot what?
1355120	1360120	To shoot this vein right there with the purest cocaine, Jeff.
1361120	1365120	But someone's telling me they saw a vice documentary on like this new drug.
1366120	1372120	And it's specific to Bogota where I'm going, where it's a powder, and they just blow it in your face.
1372120	1375120	And all of a sudden you're fully under their control.
1375120	1376120	And they're like, come on, let's go to the ATM.
1376120	1378120	And you're like, okay.
1378120	1379120	This is Serpent in the Rainbow.
1379120	1381120	You're describing Serpent in the Rainbow.
1381120	1382120	Serpent what?
1382120	1383120	Serpent in the Rainbow.
1383120	1384120	Yes.
1384120	1385120	Yes.
1385120	1387120	That's what happened to Bill Pullman, except they put him in a coffin instead of an ATM.
1387120	1388120	But this is the thing.
1388120	1392120	And you take out all your money, give it to him, and you're just totally agreeable.
1392120	1395120	And then you wake up the next day, you're like, where's my money?
1395120	1396120	But what if you're with a friend?
1396120	1398120	Can you blow it in your friend's face?
1398120	1399120	Sure.
1399120	1400120	Do you think you have a great night?
1400120	1401120	I think so.
1401120	1402120	Does anyone know about this drug?
1402120	1403120	Yeah, I saw it.
1404120	1405120	He saw it.
1410120	1412120	Flowers grow on trees there?
1412120	1414120	Are you sure this is that weird?
1414120	1420120	Because I did a lot of cocaine in my 20s, and very often you'd have stuff given to
1420120	1429120	you and end up walking to an ATM and feeling very good about some very dirty people.
1429120	1430120	Yeah.
1430120	1431120	Like, this is great.
1431120	1432120	That's true.
1432120	1435120	I'll tell my parents I need twice as many groceries.
1437120	1442120	Anyways, so do we ever figure out, is it 90 minutes, two hours, an hour?
1442120	1444120	Andy told me you have two hours.
1444120	1445120	Oh, sweet.
1445120	1446120	Okay, good.
1446120	1447120	Because I'm just getting warmed up.
1447120	1448120	I'm just getting warmed up.
1448120	1449120	Yeah, two hours.
1449120	1452120	They're going to call it worm-land pretty soon, because I'm going to...
1452120	1453120	Okay, I'm done.
1453120	1454120	I'm done.
1455120	1456120	Dumb.
1456120	1459120	Wait, so if we do a two-hour show, the sun will still be up when we're done.
1459120	1460120	Yep.
1460120	1461120	That's why they like it.
1461120	1463120	They're like, then we're going to go see someone funny.
1463120	1467120	Then we're all going to go to Union Jacks and do PCP.
1468120	1470120	Everyone come out to the...
1470120	1472120	Yeah, there's some shows like that.
1472120	1477120	Somebody brought everybody out to a parking lot, and there was Darth Vader on a unicycle.
1477120	1483120	I would say 10 years ago, I went to Union Jacks, I think by myself, because you go to
1483120	1488120	strip clubs alone, and Union Jacks, for those of you that do not live in Portland, is one
1488120	1491120	of Portland's shadier strip clubs in a great way.
1491120	1495120	I think every girl there was a drug dealer, because I ended up with all of them back in
1495120	1497120	my hotel room.
1497120	1500120	There was a fucking pharmacopoeia of drugs there.
1500120	1505120	Every one of them opened up their prison, had just wild ass exotic class A drugs on them.
1505120	1506120	It was really good.
1506120	1509120	So we're going to Union Jacks after this.
1510120	1512120	We've established that.
1513120	1518120	All right, so I want to bring a friend that we made last night.
1518120	1521120	I was talking to our friend Jonah Ray, and he had this friend there, and I was talking
1521120	1525120	to him, and partway into the conversation, I was like, okay, stop.
1525120	1529120	You should come on Harmon Town and talk about this stuff, and I promise it's a safe place,
1529120	1532120	because when he was talking, it was very mythical.
1532120	1539120	I'm a horrible interviewer, so I don't want to say at the top why I thought he'd make
1539120	1543120	an interesting guest, and then he comes out and goes, well, what you said.
1543120	1545120	Let's explore it together.
1545120	1554120	Let's explore him together, and he's being really cool coming here and make him feel
1554120	1559120	safe and open your mind and your heart to his humanity.
1559120	1561120	No one does that in Portland, right?
1561120	1563120	Bill Pullman!
1563120	1565120	Tom Hanks, everybody!
1569120	1571120	Bill Pullman's the funniest person.
1571120	1573120	Gallagher!
1576120	1580120	That would have been an amazing introduction of just like a random cameo.
1582120	1585120	Patton Oswaltz, guys, just open your hearts and your mind.
1585120	1587120	Open your heart to his humanity.
1587120	1589120	Andy Kindler, everybody.
1589120	1591120	Craig, are you up there?
1591120	1593120	Are you ready to come down?
1593120	1595120	Craig, bring it down there, would you?
1595120	1597120	Craig Flippe, come down here.
1605120	1607120	Oh, I should be.
1607120	1612120	When you have a guest on your show, it makes it good.
1614120	1616120	Sit anywhere you like.
1617120	1619120	Hello, Craig.
1619120	1623120	Sorry, I was a little nervous when we go to town, so I'm less entertaining and I have
1623120	1625120	more guests.
1625120	1631120	So Craig met you last night at the hotel, and you started talking.
1632120	1634120	There's layers here, there's layers.
1634120	1636120	Sure.
1636120	1640120	First, top layer, superficial layer, you're a Bigfoot hunter.
1644120	1645120	Enthusiast.
1645120	1647120	He's already a Bigfoot enthusiast.
1647120	1649120	You can't say hunter.
1649120	1651120	You've got to really eat the mic.
1651120	1653120	You've got to eat the mic.
1653120	1657120	Because there are guys, we talked a little bit about the Bigfoot hunting community, and
1657120	1660120	there's guys who want to kill Bigfoot, and there's guys who want to protect Bigfoot.
1661120	1666120	So they don't say Bigfoot hunters, some of them do, but that's like the Texas guys,
1666120	1670120	they want to shoot to kill, basically.
1674120	1676120	They want to shoot first and ask questions later on Bigfoot.
1676120	1678120	There's so many questions.
1678120	1680120	Yeah, I know, there are a million questions.
1680120	1684120	It's to protect the species, you have to have a body.
1684120	1688120	Can you divide the kill Bigfoot people into two people?
1688120	1691120	Are there people who want to kill Bigfoot to protect the species, and people who want
1691120	1694120	to kill Bigfoot because they hate them?
1694120	1698120	Yeah, or they have a polar bear already, and a rhino.
1698120	1701120	How would killing a Bigfoot protect the species?
1701120	1703120	Well, you can study them.
1703120	1706120	Well, then you say, oh, there's a body, they exist, they must be in danger.
1706120	1708120	You know, these liberal assholes.
1708120	1710120	It's even more endangered.
1710120	1714120	If we just nut up and shoot the fucker, we could get one.
1715120	1719120	But these liberal peacenicks who are trying to trap them with a big box and a carrot
1719120	1722120	and a stick, that's why we haven't got one yet.
1722120	1724120	Let's get some more.
1724120	1728120	But more importantly, I think the second layer is that you're at kind of a crossroads.
1728120	1729120	Can I ask how old you are?
1729120	1730120	Is that rude?
1730120	1732120	Yeah, I guess you have to remember.
1732120	1734120	I think I'm 38.
1734120	1736120	You think you're 38.
1736120	1742120	You're roughly my age, and you're a little younger, but not by a significant factor.
1742120	1744120	Why am I talking about that?
1744120	1748120	Who cares how our ages are different?
1748120	1749120	Forget about Bigfoot.
1749120	1750120	What year were you at?
1750120	1751120	How many years have we apart?
1751120	1752120	We're all starting back.
1752120	1757120	So your feelings about the Clintons are a little more cynical.
1757120	1762120	You can hum more bars of Video Killed the Radio Star.
1762120	1767120	But you made me kind of stop you and go, I think this is good.
1767120	1768120	Well, no, there were two things.
1768120	1774120	So the second layer is you are kind of at this duality place where you're comfortable
1774120	1777120	with the idea that Bigfoot does not exist.
1777120	1778120	Right.
1778120	1779120	Yeah.
1779120	1781120	And you were like, do you think it exists or not?
1781120	1784120	And I'm like, I can't give you that answer, sir.
1784120	1788120	Which is, you know, it's hard to be a Bigfoot hunting agnostic.
1788120	1789120	Right.
1789120	1790120	Yeah.
1790120	1791120	That's a tough gig.
1791120	1792120	Yeah.
1793120	1796120	Because you're probably assailed on all sides by...
1800120	1801120	I didn't touch anything.
1801120	1802120	What the fuck was that?
1802120	1803120	I did not touch anything.
1803120	1806120	That does make me think, though, that when we're done with the brief conversation, we
1806120	1811120	should have Spencer come out and take Craig through a role playing Bigfoot hunt.
1814120	1815120	Where you...
1815120	1816120	All right.
1816120	1817120	But just off the cuff.
1817120	1819120	But I mean, that's how my mind works.
1819120	1820120	That's what I do.
1820120	1822120	I'll show you a few techniques.
1822120	1828120	Craig, what was the origin for you, like your origin story of getting into the Bigfoot mythology?
1829120	1832120	Like just books in the library when I was a kid.
1832120	1838120	And then also my dad was always supposed to take me on an epic Bigfoot hunting journey.
1838120	1839120	There's the third layer.
1839120	1840120	Yeah.
1840120	1841120	Right.
1841120	1844120	That's when I stopped you and said, you need to come meet my friends.
1844120	1846120	Because the first layer is he's a Bigfoot hunter.
1846120	1849120	The second layer is he's an agnostic Bigfoot hunter.
1849120	1853120	The third layer is the reason he can do that is because his fucking dad.
1853120	1855120	And I started to weep.
1857120	1860120	Because this is what religion should be.
1860120	1861120	This is like...
1861120	1863120	This is folk mythology.
1863120	1864120	It's self-created.
1864120	1865120	So anyways...
1865120	1866120	Yeah.
1866120	1868120	I felt like I found Jesus.
1868120	1874120	Craig, do you believe that it's possible that there are such things as Sasquatches?
1874120	1875120	Yeah.
1875120	1876120	It's totally possible.
1876120	1881120	I mean, if you really look into it, get down in the layers of it.
1881120	1883120	Like the forests are bigger than we think.
1883120	1884120	Yeah.
1884120	1888120	That was one of the first turning points where when I was out by myself and I'm looking and
1888120	1890120	I'm like, this is so fucking crazy.
1890120	1897120	The first thing a cryptozoologist would tell you is, I think, you know, there's seven...
1897120	1898120	They'd start saying numbers.
1898120	1901120	Like there's 70,000 species that we haven't...
1901120	1902120	Right.
1902120	1903120	We vote blah, blah, blah.
1903120	1905120	And we discover 3,000 new ones a day and blah, blah, blah.
1905120	1908120	Like a giant panda was discovered in like 32 or something.
1908120	1909120	Yeah.
1909120	1910120	There was like a giant squid that someone discovered.
1910120	1911120	Well, I mean...
1911120	1915120	Or that new drug in Bogota, Colombia.
1915120	1916120	Right.
1916120	1917120	But okay.
1917120	1923360	So let's start at what I think is the core of the onion and onion's a good metaphor because
1923360	1926200	you're going to make me cry.
1926200	1927480	Let's start with your dad.
1927480	1928480	Your dad was...
1928480	1931120	You said your dad was supposed to take you big foot or something.
1931120	1932120	Yeah.
1932120	1933120	Okay.
1933120	1934120	You sound hesitant.
1934120	1935120	Right.
1935120	1938120	Well, actually when I was talking to you and it kind of clicked, I was like, ah, this is
1938120	1939560	the whole fucking reason I'm doing this.
1939560	1940560	It's like a dad thing.
1940560	1941560	Well, yeah.
1941560	1942560	What the fuck?
1942560	1943560	That's so dumb.
1943560	1944560	My dad fucking hit me with the wrong end of the belt.
1944560	1946880	Like your dad promised to take you out of...
1946880	1947880	Yeah.
1947880	1949840	I mean, is it embarrassing you or are you...
1949840	1951960	I was never really talking about it, but...
1951960	1958560	I mean, like take a tiny step by tiny step and I will protect you the entire way.
1958560	1959560	I think.
1959560	1960560	I'm probably not good at that.
1960560	1967520	He was like one of the best drug dealers in Connecticut where I grew up.
1967520	1968520	Your father was?
1968520	1969520	Yeah.
1969520	1971080	What qualified him as the best drug dealer in Connecticut?
1971080	1972080	I don't know.
1972080	1973840	That's like what his friend told me.
1973840	1978840	He's like, dude, me and your dad, I never trusted anyone like him.
1978840	1983680	We'd go to bed in the same hotel room with thousands of dollars and wake up together.
1983680	1984680	It started to get weird.
1984680	1988680	It started to get weird.
1989320	1990320	But like, okay.
1990320	1992280	So you lost your dad at what point?
1992280	1995160	I was 12 or 13.
1995160	1996160	Good age to lose a dad.
1996160	1997160	Probably didn't fuck you up at all.
1997160	1998160	Yeah, it was perfect.
1998160	1999160	It really worked out.
1999160	2003400	Nothing to damage there.
2003400	2006120	My wife lost her mom when she was like a teenager.
2006120	2010120	It's like, yeah, and I often tease her about it.
2010120	2012120	All right.
2012120	2013120	That's great.
2013120	2014120	She's like, can I have the remote?
2014120	2015280	And I'm like, no, your mom died.
2015280	2016280	Yeah.
2016280	2018160	Piece of shit.
2018160	2023480	You barely know what a mom is.
2023480	2027560	We're watching Naked and Afraid.
2027560	2035720	The funny part is that you're not joking.
2035720	2036720	Erin's mad right now.
2036720	2038040	And it's not because she's offended.
2038040	2040320	It's because she's like, that's my act.
2040320	2042320	Oh, nice.
2042320	2043920	She's like, I own that shit.
2043920	2046640	I make people uncomfortable with that.
2047360	2051640	Anyway, so he died in heroin overdose in Tenderloin.
2051640	2052640	Yeah.
2052640	2054800	So to have a guy say, your dad was the best at drugs.
2054800	2055800	Yeah, he did.
2055800	2056800	He won.
2056800	2057800	He won.
2057800	2058800	He won.
2058800	2059800	Yeah.
2059800	2070400	So so but he had said to you, so this sounds a little bit like I hope my dad isn't listening,
2070400	2073520	but I hope if my dad is listening, I want my dad to know that I love him and I don't
2073520	2077280	judge him and I don't mean to vilify him, but like being a kid raised by somebody who
2077280	2082840	is who has another relationship with other stuff, whether it's workaholism or or booze
2082840	2087920	or anything like like it's you that you mythologize it and it's like for a good reason.
2087920	2093680	So like my dad would like he would he would get drunk and like he'd get really excited
2093680	2097960	about really specific stuff like we're going tobogganing tomorrow, you know, and like start
2097960	2101760	fixing up the toboggan and then like he'd go like just a quick nap and then we're going
2101760	2104960	to go tobogganing and then it was Tuesday and it was like, what about the tobago?
2104960	2105960	The toboggan's there.
2105960	2113280	There's spider eggs in it and we were building a robot together that has one arm still.
2113280	2117200	So your dad, I was I was trying to make you feel safer to talk about this.
2117200	2119680	You brought up more memories here.
2119680	2126440	So your dad who lost his life in that tragic way, who was obviously fighting that demon,
2126440	2130560	he had tried to have a relationship with you and part of that was he told you, yeah, he's
2130560	2136400	like, oh, I'm going to fly you out to Bluff Creek, Northern California with a Patterson
2136400	2137400	film.
2137400	2138400	The famous.
2138400	2139400	He's like, we're going to go there.
2139400	2142320	We're going to we're going to find one blah, blah, blah.
2142320	2145520	But like, I mean, that's not as you're how old, like 10.
2145520	2148400	Yeah, like 10, which is like the height that's right.
2148400	2149680	You're Elliott in E.T.
2149680	2157600	You're your mind is a sponge and it's soaking in like like you just you're you're a goonie.
2158240	2163120	Every day is an adventure and he's he's just a guy and he's saying you're going to make
2163120	2164120	me cry.
2164120	2165120	Yeah.
2165120	2166920	So he's like, we're going to go.
2166920	2167920	We're going to find.
2167920	2168920	Yeah.
2168920	2169920	But he never did shit.
2169920	2175000	And then but he so my mom was separated, but she had like these fucking scumbag guys like
2175000	2176000	oh, sorry.
2176000	2177000	This is live.
2177000	2178000	Oh, yes.
2178000	2179000	This is going to go.
2179000	2180000	Well, no, no, no, it's not live.
2180000	2181240	But also I'll tell her not to listen.
2181240	2182240	It's not.
2182240	2183240	Oh, are you worried about your mom?
2183240	2184240	We can we can lift something.
2184240	2187000	If you say anything that you want lifted, we will lift it like like.
2187000	2190960	So speak freely from the heart if you decide later because we have to edit it a little
2190960	2191960	bit.
2191960	2192960	Sure.
2192960	2193960	So so we're not live.
2193960	2194960	No.
2194960	2195960	OK.
2195960	2196960	OK.
2196960	2197960	Amateur hour over here.
2197960	2198960	Sorry, guys.
2198960	2201960	That's no, I'm going to cry.
2201960	2204960	No, I'm crying.
2204960	2212840	Just just heard something.
2212840	2220360	So so so yeah, so so a stepdad of sorts says, oh, you want to find Bigfoot?
2220360	2221360	I'll be fun.
2221360	2222360	Big foot boy.
2222360	2223360	Oh, no.
2223360	2224360	Yeah.
2224360	2226160	It started like off wrong right away.
2226160	2227160	Right.
2227160	2230160	So we hop in the truck and he takes me out to the woods somewhere.
2230160	2234360	This isn't going to be as bad as it's going to be.
2234360	2235360	God.
2235360	2236360	Thank God.
2236360	2249320	That was the sound of that was a two hundred and fifty person bow and arrow pulled out.
2249320	2255920	And you said that in the arrow when we were all ready for anything.
2255920	2257920	Holy shit.
2257920	2260200	All right.
2260200	2261640	So he just he takes me in this.
2261640	2262640	You want to meet Bigfoot?
2262640	2263640	I'll show you Bigfoot.
2263640	2264640	Yes.
2265400	2272400	He takes me to this field and and he's like, he's it's not going to happen.
2272400	2277400	It's just not as bad as he thinks it's going to be.
2277400	2278400	All right.
2278400	2279400	Keep going.
2279400	2280400	Keep going.
2280400	2281400	Yeah.
2281400	2283320	So he's like, oh, you know, there's tons of Bigfoot here.
2283320	2284320	You just got to go look good.
2284320	2287680	You got to go look for the tracks like like.
2287680	2293680	So I'm like all jazzed up, like running through the field looking and like even then I was
2293720	2296040	like, there's no fucking tracks here.
2296040	2299440	Like he was just being like kind of a deadbeat Bigfoot hunter.
2299440	2300440	Yeah.
2300440	2301440	Like it's just like a shitty.
2301440	2302440	There's a night.
2302440	2303440	It's a sniper.
2303440	2307240	Well, was he hazing you or was he just sort of being lazy?
2307240	2308480	Was he trying to do good?
2308480	2309480	But he was just kind of.
2309480	2310480	He was drinking in the truck.
2310480	2311480	Right.
2311480	2312480	And then do you think he wanted.
2312480	2316040	Do you think he was trying to be a good dad or do you think he was like, like actually
2316040	2317040	being cruel to you?
2317040	2320520	I think he was an alcoholic, like, like really bad.
2320840	2322320	So I don't know what he was like.
2322320	2323320	Maybe he was nice.
2323320	2325320	But you didn't know like he was.
2325320	2330680	But yeah, well, I would project onto that because I think I think part of my history
2330680	2334840	is like I think I think kids tend to blame themselves and then deify like like like people
2334840	2338920	who are like kind of like their fuckups are like, oh, he was being cool, but he didn't
2338920	2339920	he meant well.
2339920	2340920	So who knows?
2340920	2341920	Maybe I don't know.
2341920	2342920	I guess maybe.
2342920	2343920	I don't know.
2343920	2344920	You have to know all about this guy.
2344920	2345920	I don't know.
2345920	2346920	He's just like Bigfoot doesn't exist.
2346920	2347920	Oh, so.
2347920	2348920	Yeah.
2348920	2350120	So that's when you got back in the truck.
2350720	2353320	That's like the equivalent of like teaching you to swim by throwing you out of a boat.
2353320	2355040	He's like, there's Bigfoot out there.
2355040	2356040	Go find him.
2356040	2357040	Two hours later.
2357040	2358040	Told you.
2358040	2359040	Doesn't exist.
2359040	2360040	Yeah, exactly.
2360040	2361040	Show me a footprint.
2361040	2362040	Fuck you.
2362040	2363040	Let's go home and watch Nova.
2363040	2364040	Right.
2364040	2365040	So I quit after that.
2365040	2370040	Like soon after that, I was just I just kind of like you felt a little whether regardless
2370040	2373840	of his intention, your experience was you felt a little humiliated and chastened and
2373840	2374840	you drew back.
2374840	2377160	I was like, oh, that's stupid to think that that's real.
2377160	2379480	And this is like something that your dad said.
2379480	2385160	So then, OK, so then a new what age were you when this got reawakened in you?
2385160	2386160	Twenty seven.
2386160	2387160	It's awesome.
2387160	2388160	I mean, that's the age.
2388160	2389160	That's the right age.
2389160	2390160	Like, right.
2390160	2391160	I don't know.
2391160	2392160	You said that like, like it should be 14.
2392160	2393160	It should be.
2393160	2399120	No, you're an adult and all of a sudden you're Carl, Carl Jung described like when he started
2399120	2402840	exploring the collective unconscious, he's like, I need to understand this shit better.
2402840	2406560	So what he focused on was his childhood and he went and played in a sandbox, literally
2406560	2411240	like he was just like, I'm going to or maybe he or he had like little he used to like make
2411240	2412880	little models when he was a kid.
2412880	2416560	He did everything he could remember doing as a kid, revisited that stuff.
2416560	2422080	And he said his his dreams started to become more vivid and active and he was able to analyze
2422080	2424440	them better because he was touching back.
2424440	2428440	It makes perfect sense because the human mind has two protocols.
2428440	2432320	It's supposed to be adaptable, it's supposed to be able to make a world out of anything
2432320	2439560	around it, but also it has to be like this Spartan, vicious, nasty, calloused machine
2439560	2444800	that protects everything that hurts it then gets turned into a defense system.
2444800	2450160	And so you're experiencing this duality, which is amazing because you're like, you've achieved
2450160	2454720	every person's dream, really, which is like you have a relationship with a thing that
2454720	2457240	doesn't need to exist or not exist.
2457240	2463160	And it's about like, like, you know, the only the first guy you ever met who created
2463160	2467000	you and who made mistakes and fought her.
2467000	2474080	I mean, so so now I mean, like I I met your wife up there and I couldn't get a read on
2474080	2475080	her.
2475080	2482760	Like, I don't know if she like, you know, she she is your very lovely wife, like I have
2482760	2483760	no idea.
2483760	2487120	Like she's she described at one point like you guys fell in love and like you were talking
2487160	2490600	about like, like, like there was a point in your relationship where the courtship was
2490600	2492160	over and you had sealed the deal.
2492160	2494400	And then one day you were like, I got to go for three months.
2494400	2500600	And you're like, wow, that's got to be every woman's greatest dream, like, is the husband
2500600	2504000	at the foot of the bed putting on the camouflage jacket and going, there's a there's a creature
2504000	2507000	out there.
2507000	2510200	And she's like, now there is now.
2510200	2514240	Are you sure this isn't a reaction to yesterday's breakfast?
2514240	2517240	What is going on?
2517240	2524080	But anyway, so Craig, how much like actively like are you out in the field, like actually
2524080	2526560	actively looking for Sasquatch?
2526560	2534960	I just call it camping, you know, like.
2534960	2537400	So passive aggressive.
2537400	2538400	So passive aggressive.
2538400	2539400	That's great, though.
2539400	2540400	That's that's that's permanent.
2541200	2545200	Damn it, Jeff.
2545200	2547200	Little camping music.
2547200	2551240	Like, well, let's OK, let can we bring Spencer down at this?
2551240	2552240	Yeah, Spencer.
2571400	2573400	I don't know.
2573400	2576400	I don't know how this is going to work.
2576400	2578400	All right.
2578400	2582400	If that falls, that's entertainment.
2582400	2583400	Maybe not.
2583400	2585400	It looks like it's going to fall into the audience.
2585400	2586400	Spencer.
2586400	2589400	I mean, you know, that's going to impale Avalon's eye.
2589400	2593400	Avalon seems like a hearty guy.
2593400	2594400	Yeah, he can survive anything.
2594400	2598400	His parents named him Avalon and he's walking.
2598400	2601400	He's walking tall.
2601400	2609400	Spencer, it's always a delight to bring you to Portland where you like suddenly fit in.
2609400	2611400	You know, you keep and Dustin.
2611400	2614400	They share that like Dustin Marshall.
2614400	2620400	I'm always so excited to see them walk into a bar in Portland when no one looks up because
2620400	2626400	it's like bringing a baby tiger cub to a to a to like one of those preserves.
2626400	2630400	And it jumps out the car window and you're like, OK, go.
2630400	2632400	What do you mean by that, though?
2632400	2636400	This is like the second third time I've heard a baby tiger all this.
2636400	2637400	I don't know.
2637400	2639400	What what what do you guys like that?
2639400	2642400	I'm also like you just cut the silhouette of a Portland here.
2642400	2644400	I wish I did.
2644400	2651400	I mean, I'm the silhouette of like all sorts of like an Arkansas man or like any guy that
2651400	2654400	wields some sort of cutting implement like I have.
2654400	2656400	There's a I match a lot of trucker.
2656400	2658400	I match a lot of silhouettes.
2658400	2663400	Yeah, but it's this it's this response that makes you fit in here.
2663400	2671400	Because if I if I took you to Arkansas, someone might go, I bet he can saw real good.
2671400	2676400	Also, the Arkansas, I guess I also the fact that you walked down Burnside with a blue ox.
2676400	2679400	I think a lot of people.
2679400	2680400	Well, that's just better.
2680400	2687400	You know, you have a beard and you're large and looks like that's not how I view Portlanders.
2687400	2688400	Very passive aggressive.
2688400	2693400	Well, I guess beards and practical.
2693400	2695400	And I don't think Portlanders are practical.
2695400	2696400	No offense, Portland.
2696400	2697400	Oh, my God.
2697400	2698400	This is OK.
2698400	2699400	All right.
2699400	2701400	How do you think they're impractical?
2701400	2704400	I say they're the picture of impracticality.
2704400	2705400	All right.
2705400	2706400	Well, let's split.
2706400	2709400	I think I think I think they're ready to hear it to give it to them.
2709400	2710400	Give it.
2710400	2711400	All right, Portland.
2711400	2713400	Give me something to make fun of.
2713400	2716400	Oh, what is that a practicality?
2716400	2717400	Oh, yeah.
2717400	2718400	Tall bikes.
2718400	2720400	I mean, that's just that's that's feeding me.
2720400	2721400	OK.
2721400	2722400	All right.
2722400	2724400	I got to spin something into it.
2724400	2725400	Donuts.
2725400	2726400	Donuts.
2726400	2727400	Don't don't.
2727400	2736400	They're a sponsor.
2736400	2742400	The dark underbelly of Portland controlled by big donut.
2742400	2746400	Well, I mean, donuts donuts are a very practical food, though,
2746400	2749400	because they like you could string them on a rope and you're good to go.
2749400	2750400	All right.
2750400	2752400	I you're a contrarian.
2752400	2755400	The you should take you to the state of contraria.
2755400	2757400	Is that what Portland is?
2757400	2758400	No.
2762400	2763400	I don't know.
2763400	2764400	You look like a lumberjack.
2764400	2765400	What's it?
2765400	2768400	I guess, see, I don't picture Portland as a lumberjack city.
2768400	2769400	Maybe I'm wrong.
2769400	2771400	I mean, they could be a lot of lumberjacks.
2771400	2773400	Are you guys lumberjacks?
2773400	2775400	If you can hunt Bigfoot here anywhere, you can hunt Bigfoot.
2775400	2778400	You can shrink the forest lumber.
2778400	2781400	There's forest to be turned into paper and stuff.
2781400	2782400	All right.
2782400	2783400	Well, Spencer.
2783400	2784400	All right.
2784400	2786400	This is like I got off on the wrong foot with you.
2786400	2787400	Well, I'm sure you're right.
2787400	2790400	I think I've agitated you.
2790400	2794400	I've aggroed you in video game terms.
2795400	2799400	But I was wondering, we have to walk a tightrope if we do this,
2799400	2802400	but I really believe we can do this.
2802400	2805400	Like it just came up off the top of my head that Craig's up here.
2805400	2809400	He's a really fucking cool, smart sport, super sensitive,
2809400	2813400	has like bared his soul to a totally supportive group of people.
2813400	2817400	We're in this town hall or in this amazing city that sits atop the bosom
2817400	2822400	of the ocean and doesn't reward people for sweatiness and ambition
2822400	2825400	and dishonesty and says like whoever you are is who you are.
2825400	2829400	And even the homeless people are comfortable and they have backpacks
2829400	2831400	and maybe they're not homeless.
2831400	2834400	They have dogs and wives.
2834400	2836400	How do you get that many tattoos if you're homeless?
2836400	2841400	Like tattoos are like that's like having a hot tub.
2841400	2844400	That's something you get after you get a home.
2844400	2846400	But that's me being from California thinking that way.
2846400	2847400	That's ridiculous.
2847400	2848400	I'm like Tim Allen.
2848400	2851400	So anyways, it's a good place to do it.
2851400	2852400	It's a good experiment.
2852400	2853400	You're young.
2853400	2854400	Craig is awesome.
2854400	2857400	Like Bigfoot mythology fathers.
2857400	2863400	Like could we experiment with doing just a quick like, like,
2863400	2866400	kind of like a campaign, like a role playing campaign.
2866400	2872400	Could you find like the nature guide in you to like create a quick campaign
2872400	2877400	where our car breaks down and we go into the woods and something happens
2877400	2886400	that can help Craig achieve just weightlessness and atone with the cosmos.
2886400	2889400	Fathers.
2889400	2890400	Spencer, you want to give it a whirl?
2890400	2891400	I don't.
2891400	2892400	Wait, what?
2892400	2893400	All right.
2893400	2894400	All right.
2894400	2895400	No, you can't.
2895400	2896400	It wouldn't work.
2896400	2898400	I say just try it out.
2898400	2903400	Can you do an RPG for us right now where it's a Bigfoot world?
2903400	2906400	The four of us, Dan, Craig, Steve and I are in a car.
2906400	2907400	The car breaks down.
2907400	2914400	We're just outside of Portland and maybe there's a Sasquatch.
2914400	2915400	You're just describing it.
2915400	2921400	We're going to create a simulation where Craig gets to catch Bigfoot spoilers.
2921400	2924400	Well, what what system should we use?
2924400	2932400	Warhammer.
2932400	2933400	A lot of your own audio.
2933400	2937400	That was the sound of my eyeballs on the back of my head.
2937400	2941400	Let's do like a Pathfinder kind of simple, like a D&D kind of thing.
2941400	2942400	All right.
2942400	2943400	You ready?
2943400	2944400	All right, Spencer.
2944400	2945400	This is a curb bubble.
2945400	2947400	Let's let's try it.
2947400	2949400	Let's see if we can come up with an intro.
2949400	2956400	Aren't you glad we smoked all that weed, Spencer?
2956400	2961400	What's the worst that could happen, Steve?
2961400	2967400	I mean, last time on Harmontown.
2967400	2977400	Wait, no, you it's been two hours since the car broke down and you've yet to see signs
2977400	2982400	of human life on the road.
2982400	2984400	Glows come from south.
2984400	2988400	You think that you might be able to make it back to town, but the quickest way is through
2988400	2989400	the woods.
2989400	2995400	You're not sure how to proceed whether you should leave the safety of your car and venture
2995400	2999400	out or stay safe inside.
2999400	3001400	Go.
3001400	3002400	Who's driving?
3002400	3004400	It's a broken down car.
3004400	3005400	Well, who's at the wheel?
3005400	3010400	Who's at the wheel?
3010400	3013400	There's I can't get any reception out here, dude.
3013400	3015400	I think we have to walk.
3015400	3016400	He's at the wheel.
3016400	3019400	He's kicking ass right now is what he's doing.
3019400	3022400	There's like, I'm AT&T.
3022400	3025400	Is anyone else not on AT&T?
3025400	3027400	I got no bars out here.
3027400	3028400	I'm on Verizon.
3028400	3030400	I got nothing.
3030400	3042400	I use my power to talk to animals and I call out chipmunk.
3042400	3051400	Your cry echoes out in the woods.
3051400	3055400	You hear the scattering of birds, but no chipmunks.
3055400	3058400	Did you roll that or are you just fucking trying to shut me down?
3058400	3063400	He doesn't have any dice, but why are you saying you have the power to talk to chipmunks?
3063400	3066400	That's insane.
3066400	3069400	It's worth a fucking try.
3070400	3078400	No, I mean, I don't want to be critical, but yeah, if I was, it would go something like this.
3078400	3082400	Steve just blew some of that Bogota powder in my mouth.
3082400	3086400	We're trying to do some delicate and legally say it.
3086400	3089400	I talked to all the chipmunks and it's like, do you have dice?
3089400	3090400	Did you roll that?
3090400	3092400	You're like a bull in a china shop here.
3092400	3094400	This is why system is important.
3094400	3098400	I say even though, Dan, I know what you're going to say because you're that adventurer, Ted,
3098400	3102400	that wants to walk through the woods rather than get back in the car and stay put,
3102400	3104400	like they tell you to stay put when you get lost.
3104400	3105400	They tell you that?
3105400	3106400	Yeah.
3106400	3107400	See, you didn't even know that.
3107400	3109400	No.
3109400	3113400	You're probably going to say, let's just wander towards that glowing part in the woods
3113400	3115400	and let's roll the dice.
3115400	3123400	Do you know that this neighborhood of the woods is supposed to be lousy with Sasquatch?
3123400	3125400	You actually believe in Sasquatch?
3125400	3126400	Yes, I do, and I'll tell you why.
3126400	3127400	I'll tell you why.
3127400	3128400	We're going through the woods.
3128400	3129400	Fuck you, Steve.
3129400	3130400	Fuck you, Steve.
3130400	3131400	Well, wait a minute.
3131400	3132400	All right.
3132400	3133400	This guy we're traveling with, Craig.
3133400	3134400	Yeah.
3134400	3140400	You guys didn't know this about me up until now, but...
3140400	3145400	We were just out cabinet shopping with you because you also are into woodwork.
3145400	3150400	I love polishing steel to a mirror finish.
3150400	3151400	The best wood.
3151400	3152400	That's what you want to call it, Craig.
3152400	3153400	That's what you want to call it, Craig.
3153400	3155400	A reflection of my tools.
3155400	3157400	So, yeah, what do you think?
3157400	3158400	Is this Bigfoot country?
3158400	3160400	Definitely Squatchy, bro.
3160400	3161400	Squatchy.
3161400	3173400	That guy tried to initiate it as standing O that I approve of.
3173400	3174400	Squatchy.
3174400	3175400	All right.
3175400	3176400	Squatchy.
3176400	3180400	This forest is Squatchy as shit, man.
3180400	3182400	Look, guys, I'm a pragmatist.
3182400	3184400	We'll freeze to death tonight.
3184400	3185400	It's glowing in that direction.
3185400	3190400	In our wildest dreams, we'd stumble upon a creature.
3190400	3193400	Oh, it's Bigfoot.
3193400	3194400	They travel...
3194400	3197400	Guys, they travel like lights through the forest sometimes.
3197400	3198400	What?
3198400	3199400	Yeah.
3199400	3200400	That sounds like New Age.
3200400	3201400	Well, it's one faction.
3201400	3205400	I use my low light vision to look for the forest.
3205400	3208400	You're not...
3208400	3214400	Just follow us.
3214400	3222400	Why would we be excited to find Bigfoot if you were an elf?
3222400	3223400	You're a guy.
3223400	3224400	You're just...
3224400	3225400	You're you.
3225400	3226400	You're a guy.
3226400	3227400	I'm just trying to have fun, Dan.
3227400	3228400	We're out in the woods.
3228400	3230400	I'm trying to make the best of a bad situation.
3230400	3231400	Okay.
3231400	3236400	So, look, he doesn't have low light vision.
3236400	3238400	We're human beings.
3238400	3239400	It's 2015.
3239400	3241400	We're broken down in a car.
3241400	3242400	It's freezing.
3242400	3244400	We're gonna die if we stay here.
3244400	3247400	Chipmunk!
3247400	3254400	I'm getting out of the car, and I'm gonna at least walk towards the glow until I get bars on my phone.
3254400	3258400	Craig, I'd appreciate it if you came with because you seem rugged.
3258400	3260400	Yeah, bro.
3260400	3263400	I got a map pocket on this jacket, so yeah.
3263400	3264400	A map pocket?
3264400	3265400	Yeah.
3265400	3272400	I put my cell phone in it.
3272400	3273400	All right.
3273400	3274400	It's in the back.
3274400	3275400	Yeah.
3275400	3276400	But no map?
3276400	3278400	That's a cell phone.
3278400	3279400	They're better.
3279400	3281400	Download apps.
3281400	3282400	All right.
3282400	3284400	Well, where's the glow?
3284400	3285400	To the south.
3285400	3286400	To the south, okay.
3286400	3287400	Let's go.
3287400	3288400	Head south.
3288400	3294400	I don't believe in Bigfoot, but if we do run into one, he's the guy to have with us.
3294400	3295400	All right, guys.
3295400	3296400	So let's just go.
3296400	3300400	We need to kill one to save them on this.
3300400	3304400	If we do find one, I'm okay with killing it.
3304400	3305400	Yeah.
3305400	3306400	I think there's enough of us that we can do it.
3306400	3307400	We're all agreed right now.
3307400	3308400	If we see a Bigfoot, kill first.
3308400	3309400	Kill it.
3309400	3310400	Right off the bat.
3310400	3315400	Yeah, we're all coincidentally, even though we're now first being asked what kind of Bigfoot
3315400	3319400	enthusiast we are, we're all in the Ted Nugent camp.
3319400	3320400	Just by coincidence.
3320400	3322400	We're gonna eat it, too.
3322400	3323400	Spencer, we are.
3323400	3324400	We move south.
3324400	3328400	As you're trudging south, the glow gets brighter.
3328400	3331400	Behind you, you can hear rustling of leaves, and you check.
3331400	3334400	You check behind you, but you see nothing.
3334400	3335400	Chipmunks.
3335400	3338400	There's no chipmunks around here.
3338400	3339400	I called out earlier.
3339400	3341400	Nothing happened.
3341400	3342400	Your phone chirps.
3342400	3344400	One of you might have reception.
3344400	3346400	I look at my phone.
3346400	3347400	Still no bars.
3347400	3348400	Not me.
3348400	3349400	Not me.
3349400	3350400	It's not a...
3350400	3351400	Not me, man.
3351400	3352400	Oh, shit.
3352400	3353400	Oh.
3353400	3354400	It's an old...
3354400	3355400	I'm sorry.
3355400	3358920	It's an old push notification from Instagram.
3358920	3362840	So Craig and I got our phones mixed up, because mine was in his map pocket.
3362840	3364840	You should look at your phone and go...
3364840	3365840	Oh.
3365840	3366840	Yeah.
3366840	3367840	I got them.
3367840	3368840	Is that what I was supposed to say?
3368840	3369840	What does he got?
3369840	3370840	What does he got?
3370840	3371840	It sounds like reception.
3371840	3372840	Oh, yeah?
3372840	3373840	You get reception?
3373840	3374840	Yeah.
3374840	3375840	Yeah.
3375840	3376840	Check it out.
3376840	3377840	All right.
3377840	3378840	Cool.
3378840	3390520	It says, what does it say?
3390520	3392240	I can't quite read it.
3392240	3393240	Can you?
3393240	3394720	I don't know.
3394720	3398360	It says, I used my low light vision to read his text message.
3398360	3399360	Damn it.
3399360	3401960	God damn it.
3401960	3402960	So close.
3402960	3404200	So close to intimacy.
3404200	3406680	It says, hey, kiddo.
3406680	3410200	Remember, that knife you have, I took it from you.
3410200	3412720	You don't have it anymore.
3412720	3418760	I'll see you at home.
3418760	3419760	Typical grandpa.
3419760	3420760	That was fucked up.
3420760	3421760	All right.
3421760	3422760	Well, let's...
3422760	3432760	I break a branch off of a tree, and as we walk, I sharpen it with a stone, just in case.
3432760	3441780	I pull out my emerald dagger.
3441780	3444720	As you near the glow, you can hear.
3444720	3445720	You can hear.
3445720	3446720	We were in a car.
3446720	3447720	Why would you...
3447720	3459380	I never go into a forest without bringing my emerald dagger down, and you know that.
3459380	3461720	As you near the glow, you can hear.
3461720	3470020	You can hear the crunching of something crunchy, as well as low rumbling growls that sound
3470020	3473540	like some sort of animal.
3473540	3476040	Fuck.
3476040	3479920	It's coming from where we're walking to?
3479920	3486180	It's coming from the source of the glow, or that direction at any rate.
3486180	3487680	Are you supposed to scare him?
3487680	3490200	First, you've got to assess the sitch.
3490200	3496160	You've got to say, is this a quadruped or a biped coming towards me?
3496160	3497160	You're in charge now.
3497160	3498160	All right.
3498160	3502860	Guys, I think I heard two footsteps, but it could have been four.
3502860	3507520	I'm pretty drunk.
3507520	3514880	Well, are we supposed to...
3514880	3516600	Are we supposed to...
3516600	3517600	Is the idea with Bigfoot...
3517600	3520720	They say if a bear attacks you, you're supposed to play dead?
3520720	3521720	What are you doing with him?
3521720	3523640	I wish a Bigfoot would attack me.
3523640	3524640	Oh.
3524640	3527360	Oh, boy.
3527360	3528960	We're with that guy.
3528960	3530800	All right.
3530800	3531800	Well...
3531800	3537280	Guys, why don't we form a perimeter?
3537280	3539360	Let's try to surround him a little bit.
3539360	3542800	I go, get out of here, get out of here, get out of here.
3542800	3544640	How close are we to the glowing?
3544640	3546000	How close?
3546000	3548120	You can't see the source of it.
3548120	3549120	It seems like it's...
3549120	3552400	If I climb a tree, will I be able to get a good look at it?
3552400	3553400	Perhaps.
3553400	3554400	I climb a tree.
3554400	3555400	Holy shit.
3555400	3556400	You...
3556400	3557400	Agee?
3557400	3558400	In the complete darkness.
3558400	3559400	Dudes, I haven't done this since I was 10.
3559400	3560400	This is awesome.
3560400	3561400	That was amazing.
3561400	3562400	You're...
3562400	3563400	Holy shit.
3563400	3564400	Agee's nimble as a mountain goat.
3564400	3565400	Oh, my God.
3565400	3566400	He's way up there.
3566400	3567400	I see something.
3567400	3568400	Yeah.
3568400	3570600	You see the glow, the source of the glow, rather.
3570600	3575400	It seems like it used to be a campfire, some sort of fiery camp.
3575400	3580400	It's been scattered, scattered and destroyed, and all you can see is the glowing embers
3580400	3581400	as well.
3581400	3582400	Oh, my God.
3582400	3583400	Oh, my God.
3583400	3584400	Oh, my God.
3584400	3585400	Oh, my God.
3585400	3586400	Oh, my God.
3586400	3587400	Oh, my God.
3587400	3588400	Oh, my God.
3588400	3589400	Oh, my God.
3589400	3590400	Oh, my God.
3590400	3591400	Oh, my God.
3591400	3596460	And all you can see is the glowing embers as well as shadows lurking around the source
3596460	3598600	of the fire.
3598600	3601440	Let's keep going towards the fire, guys.
3601440	3604240	You guys go to the fire.
3604240	3605640	It's a fire?
3605640	3606680	There's a campfire.
3606680	3607680	There's...
3607680	3609240	The dying embers of a campfire over there.
3609240	3610240	What did Jess said?
3610240	3611240	I go up and examine.
3611240	3613240	I look for tracks.
3613240	3614240	Where?
3614240	3616640	Like around the campfire.
3616640	3617640	Okay.
3617640	3619400	Well, you got to get to the campfire first.
3619400	3622940	I run headlong and...
3622940	3626120	You run headlong to where the source of the glowing is.
3626120	3629040	You see footprints all around.
3629040	3630040	I examine them.
3630040	3631040	What do they look like?
3631040	3638040	Big footprints.
3638040	3643680	I reach into my knapsack and I pour an alginate cast into it to make a track...
3643680	3645800	To make a footprint cast of it.
3645800	3646800	Not before I do.
3646800	3651760	Dan, Dan, Dan, you know I bring an emerald dagger and an alginate wherever I fucking
3651760	3652760	go.
3652760	3653760	Okay.
3653760	3658160	Well, I assume after a while, because we didn't charge headlong, we get there too.
3658160	3659160	Yeah.
3659160	3660160	We show up.
3660160	3661160	That also happens.
3661160	3663160	We find him pouring a cast.
3663160	3664160	What are you doing?
3664160	3665920	Craig, what the fuck are these?
3665920	3669920	I'm preserving what appears to be Sasquatchy and...
3669920	3671920	This campfire is Squatchy, man.
3671920	3672920	Craig?
3672920	3673920	Craig, what do you think?
3674040	3677560	Did you just dump that plaster in without splatter?
3677560	3679280	Do you think the splatter technique first?
3679280	3680280	Oh shit.
3680280	3681280	Is that a thing?
3681280	3682280	Fuck Jeff.
3682280	3683280	You fucked up.
3683280	3684280	I don't know the protocol.
3684280	3685280	Explain, Craig.
3685280	3686280	Explain.
3686280	3687280	You just...
3687280	3692640	I can't believe you didn't know this.
3692640	3696120	When you find the print, first you just splatter a little bit.
3696120	3697120	All over the place.
3697120	3698120	Just splatter.
3698120	3699320	So there's no air pockets, right?
3699320	3701040	Just to get the nice coat there.
3701160	3705080	Because when you dump it in, it distorts the evidence.
3705080	3707960	Oh, because of the weight of the alternate...
3707960	3708960	Well fortunately...
3708960	3709960	Luckily there's more footprints.
3709960	3711600	There's loads of footprints.
3711600	3714760	There's only one at a time.
3714760	3719480	Oh, that's why they don't call him Big Feet.
3719480	3722400	That makes sense.
3722400	3724320	He only ever leaves one print.
3724320	3726680	All right, well he's doing that.
3726680	3728520	Is it an actual burning campfire?
3728800	3732840	That's a bigger deal than any footprint that someone made of fire.
3732840	3739200	Yeah, you see, it's not a proper fire, but there's definitely burnt and burning and burned
3739200	3742840	logs and wooden pieces that were arranged together.
3742840	3746720	They've been since scattered as if someone tried to drop kick or quickly put out the
3746720	3749400	fire and haste to make a hasty retreat.
3749400	3750480	But we saw the glow.
3750480	3754480	That means we're upon entities that knew we were coming.
3754480	3755480	This is Squatchy.
3755480	3757920	There's a Bigfoot track here.
3758360	3759360	Big Feet.
3759360	3764600	I examined the ground for any spore or hair or any kind of foreign material.
3764600	3767600	Amateur, amateur, amateur.
3767600	3769840	Spore, spore.
3769840	3772720	Well Craig, what would you do?
3772720	3776800	This is where we're going to live for a while, guys.
3776800	3787160	I thought we were hiding in the civilization.
3787160	3794640	I cast Magic Sleeping Bag.
3794640	3801000	So then, okay, let's live here and then we'll move it together.
3801000	3804400	Magic Sleeping Bag pops into existence.
3804400	3806880	Can we advance time and we've lived there a while?
3806880	3807880	Sure.
3807880	3808880	Okay.
3808880	3812080	How long do you want to advance time?
3812080	3816760	We've all got beards and we have our own alphabet.
3816760	3823320	I've also carved a rocking chair out of a sequoia.
3823320	3825960	All right, those things happen.
3825960	3828920	Steve and I are married.
3828920	3834360	We have an agreement that when we get back, we won't talk about it.
3834360	3837120	We're doing what we have to do to survive inside.
3837120	3838800	We're mountain married.
3838800	3842960	And I proved Bigfoot exists to four people.
3842960	3850240	All right, so we're there.
3850240	3851240	This is the key morning.
3851240	3852240	We wake up.
3852240	3854440	You're waked up.
3854440	3855520	There's a campfire.
3855520	3856520	It's burning.
3856520	3863200	You've been maintaining it for however long you've been there.
3863200	3865800	You hear footsteps approaching from the north.
3865800	3866800	Here it is.
3866800	3867800	It's coming, guys.
3867800	3870000	It better be fucking firewood, man.
3870000	3871600	We better cut it all this shit.
3871600	3872600	I know.
3872600	3876800	This place is like a parking lot now.
3876800	3879920	Couple more trees and we have to start a rock concert.
3879920	3884080	I just, out of idle curiosity, go towards the sound of the footsteps.
3884080	3888160	You go towards the sound of the footsteps and you see an old barefooted man holding
3888160	3889160	a rifle.
3889160	3890160	Oh, shit.
3890160	3893160	It's only a game, sir.
3893160	3896160	It's only a game.
3896160	3900600	Does he look like a...
3900600	3901600	He's a human being?
3901600	3902600	He's a regular guy?
3902600	3905200	Oh, he's the humanist of beings.
3905200	3908400	I look at his feet, so I know it's not one of those old gags.
3908400	3909400	What?
3909400	3911400	He doesn't have giant feet, right?
3911400	3912400	No.
3912400	3913400	Okay.
3913400	3914400	No.
3914400	3915400	Just holding a rifle.
3915400	3916400	All right.
3916400	3917400	Ted Nugent?
3917640	3920640	Old man, take a look at our lives.
3920640	3921640	What is that?
3921640	3923640	We're a lot like you.
3923640	3924640	It's Neil Young.
3924640	3928040	It's Neil Young.
3928040	3930040	We're just here looking...
3930040	3936680	Originally, we were trying to find a gas station, but we are now looking for Bigfoot.
3936680	3938680	What's your name, old man?
3938680	3939680	Skater.
3939680	3942880	Y'all look like some big feats.
3942880	3943880	No.
3943880	3944880	No.
3944880	3945880	I mean, no.
3945880	3947360	We're good people.
3947360	3948360	Prove it.
3948360	3951600	I drop my pants and I don't know.
3951600	3952600	I mean, I...
3952600	3954160	We're wearing clothes for a while.
3954160	3956880	I throw my emerald dagger at his heart.
3956880	3958880	All right.
3958880	3961560	Well, I mean, okay.
3961560	3962560	You know what?
3962560	3965760	I stop and I go meta for a second.
3965760	3971480	I guess my goal was to meet Bigfoot and have Craig start crying as he touched Bigfoot's
3971480	3972480	face.
3972480	3974920	But you know what?
3974920	3976480	What business is that of mine?
3976480	3980800	Why am I trying to turn his passion and his religion into my sideshow bullshit?
3980800	3981800	Why are you playing God?
3981800	3982800	Yeah.
3982800	3983800	Honey.
3983800	3984800	I think it's fantastic that he...
3984800	3986400	Honey, why are you playing God?
3986400	3987400	Yeah.
3987400	3989360	That he came up here and shared his...
3989360	3993360	I think the most amazing thing is that this thing keeps going and going and going.
3993360	3996200	Are you going to continue to go out there and...
3996200	4001560	This is the 10-year anniversary of when I took a moped trip 3,000 miles to the Pacific
4001560	4002560	Northwest.
4002560	4003560	Did you say moped?
4003560	4004560	Yeah.
4005200	4014000	Right now, it was a 10-year anniversary of the last time I heard someone say moped.
4014000	4017000	Your goal, you're kind of tempting fate that you want to get lost.
4017000	4018000	You want the...
4018000	4019000	Yeah.
4019000	4020000	I had the shittiest maps.
4020000	4022600	The maps blew off my little basket I made.
4022600	4023600	And just...
4023600	4024600	I'm like, oh.
4024600	4025600	Don't know where that...
4025600	4027560	How to get anywhere now.
4027560	4030560	This is after that morning with Brianna, where you're like, I got to go find a monster.
4030560	4033560	And then 30 miles out, you're like, whoops.
4034560	4035560	No.
4035560	4038560	You love her very much, I'm sure.
4038560	4043440	So it's the 10-year anniversary, and you're still plunging in year after year?
4043440	4049160	I'm thinking I'm going to go on another trip, but slightly shorter.
4049160	4051160	We have a kid, like five, six weeks, five, six weeks.
4051160	4052160	Just to atone?
4052160	4055760	Maybe take the kid into the woods and look at the denseness of the...
4055760	4057960	And go, this is where anything can happen.
4057960	4058960	This is where...
4058960	4059960	This is the cosmos.
4059960	4060960	Yeah.
4061360	4065360	I'm not going to tell him, like, you know, Pickfoot does or doesn't exist, but like,
4065360	4068360	I don't want to live in a world where I have to say, Pickfoot doesn't exist.
4068360	4069360	Yeah.
4069360	4070360	Or that he does.
4070360	4073360	It's like, the human mind is capable of anything.
4073360	4074360	That's amazing.
4074360	4078360	You have the opportunity now to go do what your stepdad did wrong.
4078360	4079360	Failed.
4079360	4080360	You failed, father.
4080360	4081360	Yeah.
4081360	4086360	It's to go out there and give your son an adventure and let it be exactly what it...
4086360	4087360	Whatever it wants to be.
4087360	4089360	Yeah, what it should have been in the first place.
4089360	4090360	That's so beautiful, man.
4090760	4091760	All right.
4091760	4092760	That's beautiful.
4092760	4096760	If you see Craig out there, buy him a drink and don't get invasive and...
4096760	4097760	But...
4097760	4098760	I got the right...
4098760	4101560	I got a good crotch gusset.
4101560	4102560	You got wet?
4102560	4103560	My pants.
4103560	4104560	What?
4104560	4105560	You're putting...
4105560	4106560	What?
4106560	4109560	His crotch got wet from the condensation on his cup.
4109560	4110560	Oh, okay.
4110560	4113560	So if you see him out there, he didn't wet his pants.
4113560	4114560	Thank you.
4114560	4115560	I was saying, buy him a drink.
4115560	4116560	I thought he was going like, I can't.
4116560	4117560	And then it was like peeing.
4117560	4118560	Yeah.
4118560	4119560	I can't.
4119560	4120560	I can't.
4120560	4121560	They can't buy me a drink.
4121560	4122560	They can't.
4122560	4126560	When you're bigfooting in the woods, there's no time to go take a leak.
4126560	4127560	All right.
4127560	4128560	Well, let's have a hand for Craig.
4128560	4129560	Give him a warm hug out there.
4136560	4139560	That's Portland and that's humanity.
4139560	4140560	That's the...
4142560	4144560	I just broke my teeth on the microphone.
4144560	4145560	That's...
4145560	4146560	I don't know.
4146560	4147560	Well, I don't know.
4147560	4150080	Somehow there's some intersection there.
4150080	4156280	The Northwest mentality, the human species, the idea that you bring with you, this giant
4156280	4160560	brain that can create anything, it takes all the weird shit that goes into it, a bunch
4160560	4166120	of pain and a bunch of pleasure, and it spits out anything.
4166120	4169800	Those things can be passed on to people and they can hurt those people or they can heal
4169800	4170800	them.
4170800	4173800	We don't give ourselves enough credit as a species because what are giraffes doing right
4173800	4174800	now?
4174800	4175800	They are not having a podcast.
4176040	4178920	They're visas of shit with long necks.
4178920	4182000	I'm not saying they should be extinct, but they haven't earned shit.
4182000	4185960	They're fucking horses that were like, I want to eat that apple.
4185960	4188920	They're garbage animals.
4188920	4195600	They've had longer time on this planet and they did not create Wi-Fi.
4195600	4196600	Just saying.
4196600	4200600	If it were up to them, right now they'd be like, could we make a neck that could get
4200600	4203400	to the moon?
4203400	4204400	That would be their solution.
4205000	4207000	They'd be like, maybe we can eat the moon.
4207000	4211520	They'd be like, no, the earth is a fucking burnt crisp because they don't last well on
4211520	4213520	these planets.
4213520	4214520	We're assholes.
4214520	4216520	We're a horrible animal.
4216520	4220880	We're a hyper intelligent chimpanzee that decided that we would take all this power
4220880	4226120	and fuck things up, but we're also maybe going to get some of those giraffes into outer space.
4226120	4229400	They will thank us later when we give them the power to speak.
4230400	4235960	Ladies and gentlemen, it's 2078 A.D., we're orbiting a zoo one and the first giraffe is
4235960	4236960	about to speak.
4236960	4243240	What do you have to say, Jeffrey?
4243240	4245680	Thank you.
4245680	4248240	You're welcome, motherfucker.
4248240	4249240	You're welcome.
4249240	4253840	You're coming down awfully hard on giraffes right now, dad.
4253840	4255520	I hate giraffes.
4255560	4262120	I think they represent everything that humans don't because it's all adaptation and no risk.
4262120	4264320	I think having an enormous neck is a huge risk.
4264320	4265320	No, it's not.
4265320	4266320	It's not at all.
4266320	4267320	It's the opposite of risk.
4267320	4268320	You're all in jugular vein.
4268320	4270320	No, I'm telling you, there's a principle in evolution that's like...
4270320	4271320	It's so stabbable.
4271320	4274760	If there's a biologist in the audience, there's two principles of evolution.
4274760	4277360	One is becoming hyper compatible with your environment.
4277360	4281800	So the extreme example of that is the hummingbird because it has like this beak that's really
4281800	4283720	designed for a certain flower.
4283720	4286760	If that flower goes extinct, the hummingbird is fucked.
4286760	4291240	On the other end of that spectrum, we have the things that we admire, which is adaptability.
4291240	4295760	We have a weird robot claw that is designed to grab random shit.
4295760	4297600	So you can drop us on the North Pole.
4297600	4298600	You can drop us anywhere.
4298600	4303840	And no matter where you drop us, we'll live long enough to fuck it up.
4303840	4309240	But for a long time, following that strategy made us the food of wolves and cats, like
4309240	4310440	these biological killing machines.
4310440	4313400	And they were like, where do you think you're going with this garbage?
4313400	4314400	You're walking upright.
4314400	4315400	You look like idiots.
4315400	4316400	I'm going to eat you.
4316400	4318400	And your babies are pudding.
4318400	4320760	Your babies are made of pudding.
4320760	4323200	And one in two of them die.
4323200	4328880	And they cry when they need to be picked up, which is a dinner bell.
4328880	4331400	You are doing everything wrong.
4331400	4332760	But it's like, it's a gamble.
4332760	4333760	It's a gamble.
4333760	4337920	And now every primate is dying off, not just because of us, but it's like, we did it.
4337920	4339080	We fucking took this planet.
4339080	4341920	We fucking took it.
4341920	4343280	We were not supposed to.
4344160	4346680	Bees were supposed to.
4346680	4347680	Fuck bees.
4347680	4348680	Fuck them.
4348680	4350480	What's wrong with bees?
4350480	4351480	I'm not mad at bees.
4351480	4355840	I forget I'm in Portland.
4355840	4361000	I like the idea of taking a child out and going to do something as arbitrary and mythological
4361000	4364640	and probably nonsensical as like, let's go find a Bigfoot.
4364640	4366480	That makes much more sense than going fishing.
4366480	4368280	You're going to eat that mic, bro.
4368280	4370760	You're going to eat that mic.
4370760	4371760	They can hear me.
4371760	4372760	I don't know.
4373000	4374000	I'm sorry.
4374000	4375000	I wasn't attacking you.
4375000	4376000	That's all right.
4376000	4377000	I was just worried that they couldn't hear you.
4377000	4378000	I don't know.
4378000	4379000	All right.
4379000	4380000	You go fishing.
4380000	4383960	You're just casting a hook into the water, which is a subconscious, which is like the
4383960	4384960	unseen.
4384960	4387280	And you sit there, and the whole point of going fishing is to sit there and waste time
4387280	4389520	and just connect with somebody else that you're with.
4389520	4394280	I think it's just as likely to have fun and be more important to go out there and go monster
4394280	4395280	hunting.
4395280	4396280	I think that's very cool.
4396280	4397280	I like that a lot.
4397280	4401320	It's not like we don't find monsters every day.
4401320	4403720	There are so many species.
4403720	4408200	Even tonight, you might find a monster.
4408200	4414040	Let's bring my eternal muse, the other half of my existence, the—
4414040	4415040	Jonah Ray, everybody.
4415040	4420920	Jonah Ray is here.
4420920	4426040	My beautiful wife, the son of my solar system, Aaron McGathey.
4426040	4427040	Aaron McGathey.
4427040	4446400	Aaron McGathey wearing what— My Quaker, Anne of Green Gables couture.
4446400	4447800	I bought this in Portland.
4447800	4450800	Everything I'm wearing is by a Portland person.
4450800	4455600	It's $8,000.
4455600	4462080	That's what the discriminating Flemish lady is wearing 300 years ago.
4462080	4469680	When we burn you at the stake, we're going to know why, because you're hot.
4469680	4470680	Not a pun on fire.
4470680	4474800	It was like, because you're sexy, and sexy women are the victims of massage.
4474800	4475800	No, no, no.
4475800	4476800	Break it down.
4476800	4482120	Sexy women must burn, unless they take over.
4482120	4483520	I loved Squatch Finder.
4483520	4484840	It was great.
4485280	4486280	Couple notes.
4486280	4494320	Happy Mother's Day, everybody.
4494320	4498920	I would have sent my mother flowers, but there's this groundskeeper at the cemetery that steals
4498920	4499920	them, so.
4499920	4500920	I told you.
4500920	4501920	That's been a show.
4501920	4502920	Good night, everybody.
4502920	4513680	She's like the Mad Max of dead mom jokes, like when you find a can of dog food, you
4513760	4517920	know how do you eat most of it, and then the dog gets to lick the can, and you're like,
4517920	4519800	don't fucking take my dead mom jokes.
4519800	4525040	Well, it's that, and then also when you tease me about it sometimes, sometimes it does actually
4525040	4527520	make me feel bad about my mom being dead.
4527520	4528520	Oh, cool.
4528520	4529520	Cool.
4529520	4530520	That's a relief.
4530520	4531520	Sometimes.
4531520	4532520	Sometimes.
4532520	4533520	Other times.
4533520	4534520	I'm like, this is the best.
4534520	4535520	No, it's great.
4535520	4538720	I like, I like, I like joking about it.
4538720	4541840	Did you wish that your mom would ever have taken you to do something as interesting and
4541840	4543920	specific as Sasquatch hunting?
4543920	4544920	Yeah.
4544920	4545920	Yeah.
4545920	4546920	She took me to Michael's a few times.
4546920	4551240	Did you buy some yarn, or what did you guys need a point?
4551240	4559280	My mom used to make rice dolls, which were her own invention, I think, which were like
4559280	4563920	bags that she would buy fabric and fill it with raw rice and then put a wooden head on
4563920	4569000	top and they would be female heroines from literature.
4569000	4571000	And they were pretty sad.
4571000	4574080	No, I thought, I thought they were great.
4574080	4575880	My mom was a very creative person.
4575880	4577640	So now I feel tired.
4577640	4582240	I feel like her, I'm going to see like her head floating like super men's body.
4582240	4585040	You made like little rice Anna Karenina's or like.
4585040	4587080	Well there was Anna Green Gables.
4587080	4591560	There was Elizabeth Bennett from Pride and Prejudice.
4591560	4595600	Anna Karenina, I think is, is to all, I think all the characters she wanted to explain to
4595600	4599560	me like what happened in the end and not like have it be weird.
4599560	4605160	You should start making those again and sell them as like iPhone, waterlogged iPhone savers
4605160	4613000	where you put them in the women's mouths into the rice for 24 hours.
4613000	4616120	Think of your, I mean, I don't know if this is like a huge like precipice to fall off
4616120	4620400	of, but I'm just curious when you make a joke about your mom's floating head being here.
4620400	4625920	Do you think about your, your, your mom and imagine what she would say if she was watching
4625920	4630120	you and like, like, like, what do you have thoughts about that stuff?
4630120	4632440	Like, like, Oh, if my mom were here right now.
4632440	4636560	Yeah, I mostly imagine her glare.
4636560	4645600	I mean, there's no, I wish I, uh, uh, uh, yeah, um, do you dream about her like she ever
4645600	4646600	come to you?
4646600	4647600	I do.
4647600	4648600	I do.
4648600	4649600	This is very sad.
4649600	4653920	And the dream is always like us hanging out and me saying, I thought you were dead and
4653920	4659080	her saying, Oh, no, no, no, no, um, no, I'm totally alive and everything's fine.
4659080	4660580	I'm like, let's hang out.
4660580	4661580	And now you're an adult.
4661580	4665160	And I'm like, this is the best and I'm going, I don't care that I thought you were dead for
4665160	4666160	so long.
4666160	4671400	And then I wake up and at the end of those dreams, do you go to bed because you might
4671400	4675600	be like that guy in that short lived, uh, conceptual cop show awake.
4675600	4676600	What's it called?
4676600	4680360	Like, like you might be living two lives that are both equally real.
4680360	4683560	Like maybe your mom is alive and then you're going to sleep and then this is the dream.
4683560	4693200	I should search for my mom with Craig in the forest chipmunk.
4693200	4696120	What did you think of Jeff's behavior in that game?
4696120	4705400	You know, I, I, uh, I mean, I, I, I enjoyed the banter, but I guess I was on Jeff's side.
4705400	4706400	Oh, okay.
4706400	4710880	I just felt like you brought too much supernatural power to a search for Bigfoot.
4710880	4714440	It's just kind of undercut the, we agree that we were playing a Pathfinder version of that
4714440	4715440	game.
4715440	4718680	I thought they don't have special skills and like, and like an ability is, can I approach
4718680	4719680	it wrong?
4719680	4723840	I mean, I don't, I don't want to give anyone notes, but Dan, why'd you scare wave the big
4723840	4725120	feet?
4725120	4728880	Like there, you're coming towards them and then you heard something and then you're like,
4728880	4730200	get out of here, get out of here.
4730200	4732200	And then they all ran away.
4732200	4735120	I was trying to summon magical creatures to find the big.
4735120	4738720	You said let's make a perimeter and you're, and then you just negated that and said, let's
4738720	4740360	get out of here, get out of here.
4740360	4741360	Well, okay.
4741360	4742360	You didn't want to find Bigfoot.
4742360	4743360	What's wrong with you?
4743360	4744360	What have I done?
4744360	4748000	I'm the bad guy.
4748000	4751240	In my mind, what I was doing was I was like, we just care about you.
4751240	4752240	I was forcing a hand.
4752240	4753240	And you shut us down.
4753240	4756080	Why don't you gobble your milk?
4756080	4757080	I didn't.
4757080	4758080	Kettle.
4758080	4762720	I didn't, I didn't perceive what I was doing in that moment as being counterproductive.
4762720	4766000	I perceived it as the opposite, but I was, I was getting a little tipsy at that point
4766000	4770200	and I was getting like, I was actually, you don't want to, you want to know the truth.
4770200	4771200	Here's a high road for you.
4771200	4772200	I was worried about you.
4772200	4774560	I was thinking about you up there and you're like, what the fuck is this Bigfoot thing
4774560	4775560	taking forever?
4775560	4776560	Motherfucker.
4776560	4777560	We weren't married.
4777560	4778560	Yeah.
4778560	4783080	You'll be thinking about her.
4783080	4784240	She doesn't know about that.
4784240	4787560	It doesn't, from her perspective, it's like we were in space traveling at the speed of
4787560	4788560	light.
4788560	4792560	So you didn't like that I was, I was breaking the reality of us out in the woods being actual
4792560	4793560	people.
4793560	4796640	I just, if you have an emerald dagger and low light vision and you meet a Bigfoot, wouldn't
4796640	4797960	you just be like, who cares?
4797960	4802120	I think if you have so many rules for a last minute game, you should have said them at
4802120	4803120	that time.
4803120	4804120	That was my problem.
4804120	4805120	That was my problem.
4805120	4806120	Thank you for defending me, Aaron.
4806120	4807120	I appreciate that.
4807120	4808120	You're welcome.
4808120	4809120	First and last time.
4809120	4810120	I made a huge mistake.
4810120	4811880	I always, I do this on community too.
4811880	4816520	Everything that I plan, every time I get an idea and I'm like, we should do that.
4816520	4818080	That's when the trouble starts.
4818080	4819280	Everything that I'm like, oh fuck it.
4819280	4820280	I don't know.
4820280	4821280	Just this.
4821280	4822280	That's what makes people happy.
4822280	4824560	I see that ending in your head when we started.
4824560	4825560	I'll tell you the truth.
4825560	4826560	You asked an honest question.
4826560	4830160	It deserves an honest answer and I'm going to embarrass myself and I'm the one that needs
4830160	4831160	help.
4831160	4832160	I'm fucked up.
4832160	4833360	Please appreciate my candor.
4833360	4834360	Reward it.
4834360	4836560	Don't judge me.
4836560	4843320	I truly thought in my head there was some moment where we came to a clearing and Bigfoot
4843320	4847640	was there and Spencer in all of his, I'm going to say Aspergery.
4847640	4852000	It's an overused phrase like Spencer's detachment, which I share with him.
4852000	4855880	Like his compartmentalization, like it would all add up to like this crazy thing.
4855880	4860920	So it'd be like this celebration of how we're all fucked up and like nerdy and detached,
4860920	4866000	but like it would all combine in this network to create like this nerdy role playing thing
4866000	4870440	where this guy who was really smart and sensitive was like actually like fucking like touched
4870440	4876680	Bigfoot and that we would all burst into 3000 tears.
4876680	4877680	And that was my mistake.
4877680	4881320	It's like, why would I, why would I decide that's the future and then try to make a beeline
4881320	4883240	for that instead of just embracing the moment?
4883240	4885080	I didn't meet that guy by planning to meet him.
4885080	4886080	I met him organically.
4886080	4887080	Why?
4887080	4888080	And I'm not being glib.
4888080	4890720	Like why, why then the instinct to scare Bigfoot off of it?
4890720	4893560	I want, I was, I thought it was taking too long.
4893560	4896160	So I thought maybe that would make Bigfoot come out.
4896160	4898000	If I said, if I said, get out of here, get out of here.
4898000	4903600	I thought Spencer would go lumbering down the trees is a thing because Spencer is kind
4903600	4904600	of a contrarian.
4904600	4907840	So I thought if I said, get out of here, I thought I could trick Spencer into punishing
4907840	4910600	me by having a Bigfoot not get out of there.
4910600	4913600	That is some fucking Spencer would be like, don't tell me what to do.
4913600	4918000	Well, that doesn't put Bigfoots come from everywhere because you say, get out of here.
4918000	4921560	I thought I could manipulate him, turn into Bigfoot.
4921560	4924600	You know, I think the role playing session went over really well.
4924600	4926080	I don't think you should get down.
4926080	4927400	I don't think you should fish for that.
4927400	4929200	I don't think they're falling for it because they're from Portland.
4929200	4930200	Oh, I wasn't.
4930200	4931200	Yeah.
4931200	4932200	I don't care what they think.
4932200	4934760	They live in a world where somebody sets up a donut shop and is like, I think these donuts
4934760	4935760	are all right.
4935760	4936760	I don't know.
4936760	4939920	Which, which, uh, how many of you out there were disappointed when I, when I summon chip
4939920	4940920	monk?
4940920	4941920	The chip monk did not appear.
4941920	4942920	We all wanted that.
4942920	4943920	Right?
4943920	4944920	Because you can't.
4944920	4945920	Okay.
4945920	4946920	All right.
4946920	4948200	But we're talking in circles, but I just think if you're, if you're on a Bigfoot hunt,
4948200	4952760	the scale comes down to Bigfoot has to be the most amazing thing you've ever encountered.
4952760	4956800	So like, if you watched, uh, if you watch contact with Jodie Foster and there were like
4956800	4961280	aliens working with her, Hey, Hey, Nym Nym.
4961280	4966680	Do you have a reading on the Foxtrot seven me, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
4966680	4967680	Okay.
4967680	4968680	Let's keep trying to make contact.
4969120	4971600	He's a fucking, she's talking to a worm creature.
4971600	4977920	I'm, I'm a writer.
4977920	4981840	It's kind of like being a bounty hunter, like I'm not officially allowed to have more respect,
4981840	4983160	but I should have it.
4983160	4985600	This guy put myself out there a lot.
4985600	4986600	I've been through some shit.
4986600	4987800	I'm like, dog, the bounty hunter.
4987800	4988800	I enjoyed it.
4988800	4990760	I would, I would like to actually do more.
4990760	4994640	I feel like for the first, we only played for what 10 or 15 minutes with that, right?
4994640	4996280	Like I think that was a good first 10, 15 minutes.
4996280	4998240	I would like to play more of that.
4998240	5003840	Uh, like us meeting Bigfoot role-playing game would be very, could I be the chipmunk?
5003840	5004840	Yes, Aaron.
5004840	5005840	Thank you.
5005840	5010080	Uh, in the marriage of Steve Agee and Dan Herman, um, let's say it continued.
5010080	5013680	What would a lazy Saturday be like for you guys?
5013680	5016680	Oh, it wouldn't be lazy.
5016680	5018680	Puttering around our limits.
5018680	5019680	What time do you wake up?
5019680	5020680	Do you guys eat together?
5020680	5021680	Like, what does that look like?
5021680	5022680	It was a weekend.
5022680	5023680	Yes.
5023680	5024680	It's a Saturday.
5024680	5029720	It's a bed, just our bed of pine needles.
5029720	5030720	I feel like it would work.
5030720	5032720	I feel like it would work really well.
5032720	5035880	Because I feel like, like, Agee and I are- Too lazy, motherfuckers.
5035880	5036880	Wait, wait.
5036880	5040720	Because I feel like I'm really mean to you and unfairly because you're too symbolic.
5040720	5044200	Like, because you're, because you're my wife, so now there's like, there's all these tickets
5044200	5045200	you didn't buy.
5045200	5049800	So like, I'm like mean to you for, for artificial, dishonest reasons.
5049800	5055360	Like where, whereas like, so if I was in a, if I was in a weird relationship, not, oh
5055360	5058840	god, I just call gay people weird.
5058840	5066080	If I was in a, if I was in an awesome relationship, like one that was unexpected to me, uh, with
5066080	5071200	Steve, it would, it would make, it would force me to stop playing recordings of my dad when
5071200	5072200	I talk to my partner.
5072200	5075840	And I think like, when I'm mean to you, I'm like, I'm not, it's not me as I'm not.
5075840	5077360	I mean, I ship it.
5077360	5078360	Okay, good.
5078880	5080400	Well, let's do it.
5080400	5084000	I mean, I should just think of you as aging.
5084000	5085000	That's the thing.
5085000	5086000	Yes.
5086000	5087000	Yes.
5087000	5088000	Yes.
5088000	5089000	I could do it.
5089000	5095080	Hey, I, I'll show up everywhere first, uh, and I'm always saying when we have fights,
5095080	5098720	like I, I think this is how everybody probably has frustrations because like the person that
5098720	5102800	you're with, there was that whole high fidelity monologue, like where it's like the people
5102800	5108120	that we love that we take the closest to us, they are treated to these really unfair metrics
5108560	5112160	uh, you watch a stranger walk down the street and you have it, you know, her ratty panties
5112160	5113520	aren't hanging from the shower curtain.
5113520	5114520	That was that monologue.
5114520	5115520	And I don't have,
5115520	5116560	No, you don't, I'm not saying it.
5116560	5117560	Don't get distracted.
5117560	5118560	Don't get distracted by that.
5118560	5122040	I'm saying that that's a metaphor for the fact that like we, the people that we're with
5122040	5125320	every day, like we're being so unfair to them, but they're the people that we trust.
5125320	5128720	So it's like, and it has to do with self loathing because we like the way we look through strangers'
5128720	5130600	eyes because we hate ourselves.
5130600	5134880	So it's like, we're actually being more dishonest when we first meet somebody and then we, and
5134880	5139000	then we slowly gain intimacy, which should be a gateway to like unprecedented levels
5139000	5140000	of honesty.
5140000	5143120	And instead sometimes there's a little clamp that comes down and you, and you go like,
5143120	5145480	well, this person knows me now and I'm kind of ashamed of myself.
5145480	5149080	And you start to like play out these like operas that you saw your parents play out.
5149080	5152400	I'm not blaming anything as like, like we should all work towards it, but that's what
5152400	5157520	happens is like, I'm ashamed of myself when I fight with you because I hear myself saying
5157520	5159840	things that I don't actually feel.
5159840	5164560	I just have a relationship and then the relationship is making me go like, well, I should, I should
5165080	5166680	I should be mean right now.
5166680	5169040	I can we, can we, can we try something?
5169040	5170440	Cause I have a new tactic.
5170440	5171440	Okay.
5171440	5172440	Okay.
5172440	5173440	We're going to do a little role play.
5173440	5177280	Um, we're at a, at a, at a frozen yogurt place.
5177280	5180880	You're at a frozen yogurt place.
5180880	5187040	This one you're into, it's like pulling fucking teeth to get us in the woods and meet big
5187040	5188040	footage.
5188040	5192600	I'm just a world simulator, Dan.
5192600	5194080	I don't have thoughts.
5194080	5202320	Just try to, just try to react as like, we're at a yogurt shop, we're sitting down, we're
5202320	5203320	eating yogurt.
5203320	5207040	Can I get another, oh God, she's the best.
5207040	5211880	Has anyone given her a medal?
5211880	5212880	That's Tori.
5212880	5216640	And then our, uh, I like that it's scaled down so I won't notice.
5216640	5217640	It's a slightly smaller cup.
5217640	5218640	Can I get a whiskey, please?
5218640	5219640	On the rocks.
5219640	5220640	Uh, what do you want?
5220640	5224080	A whiskey, please.
5224080	5225640	Nice try, Uncle Bob.
5225640	5227640	Uh, one for my lawyer over here.
5227640	5228640	That's Tori, man.
5228640	5229920	I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll forget to think of later.
5229920	5230920	That's Tori.
5230920	5231920	And then Mandy.
5231920	5232920	Tori, two whiskeys in the rocks, please.
5232920	5233920	If you don't mind.
5233920	5234920	Thank you, Mandy.
5234920	5236760	And thank you, uh, you're the people over there that are giving you drinks and dealing
5236760	5237760	with this giant.
5237760	5238760	Like a chilled Casadores.
5238760	5239760	A chilled Casadores.
5239760	5240760	Okay.
5240760	5241760	Okay.
5241760	5242760	All right.
5242760	5243760	So, uh, we're at, we're at a yogurt shop.
5243760	5244760	All right.
5244760	5248520	And just react as honestly, just react how you would react, reading our yogurt.
5248520	5250600	Um, are we all here or just you two?
5250600	5251600	It's just us.
5251600	5252600	Okay.
5252600	5253600	You guys are waiting in the car.
5253600	5254600	I have.
5254600	5256600	I have an emerald dagger.
5256600	5257600	All right.
5257600	5258600	Jeff, you.
5258600	5259600	Jeff.
5259600	5279600	I love that that culminated in a high five.
5279600	5288760	Uh, Jeff, Jeff sucks dick like one of those water birds, but he's so good at it.
5288760	5289760	That's how it works.
5289760	5290760	Like the comb keeps him bobbing.
5290760	5293760	It was just like, come, come.
5293760	5294760	Yeah.
5294760	5295760	He makes you come that fast.
5295760	5296760	Like that consistently.
5296760	5300240	So Steve, do you feel guilty about cheating on Dan?
5300240	5302680	Well, he's cheating on me.
5302680	5307600	He's in a yogurt shop with this chick.
5308600	5313480	Uh, Dan, I think you're, uh, you're, you're a little rude to me in front of the, uh, the
5313480	5314480	yogurt lady.
5314480	5316400	I didn't, I didn't like that.
5316400	5321840	I, well, I, why are you trying to make me apologize?
5321840	5324080	I'm not trying to make you apologize.
5324080	5325920	So let's, let's go five minutes.
5325920	5326920	Okay.
5326920	5327920	Okay.
5327920	5329520	So now I'm like, like, fuck you.
5329520	5330520	Yeah.
5330520	5331520	Hysterical.
5331520	5332520	Get a job.
5332520	5338080	You, you're, you're three episodes behind on community and it pays your rent.
5338080	5339080	Fuck you.
5339080	5340120	You should feel bad about things.
5340120	5342320	Not just me.
5342320	5343320	Get even angrier.
5343320	5345440	Like, like, are you, you don't have to use it.
5345440	5349380	Well, I mean, at this point is usually when we've split up and I'm just texting you horrible
5349380	5353400	Kevin Spacey, like fucking like, fuck off, fuck you.
5353400	5354400	Okay.
5354400	5355960	Well, uh, similar, this isn't, okay.
5355960	5356960	All right.
5356960	5360240	So my reaction, my planned reaction is what I'm going to do, like, if you're looking
5360240	5364280	at my face, just say, I hate you at a very angry, like, yellow, it's like, I hate you.
5364280	5365280	Okay.
5365280	5366280	My line is I hate you.
5366280	5367280	Yes.
5367280	5368280	I hate you.
5368280	5371480	Uh, Hey man, you want to get high?
5371480	5375040	Oh, uh, that's Steve Agee.
5375040	5385640	Um, Hey, I was just, uh, I was just at, I was just at Sarah's and, uh, like, that fucking
5385640	5387200	bitch, she told me what to do.
5387200	5389200	All right, man.
5389800	5392920	Can I, can I just sit here and play on my phone?
5392920	5393920	Yeah, man.
5393920	5394920	You're a guy that gets me high.
5394920	5395920	It's fine.
5395920	5396920	All right.
5396920	5397920	Cool.
5397920	5398920	All right.
5398920	5399920	Yeah.
5399920	5400920	So I'll do that.
5400920	5401920	Yeah.
5401920	5402920	I will.
5402920	5403920	We'll try that.
5403920	5404920	I'll do a Hey man.
5404920	5405920	I that's, well, yeah.
5405920	5412560	I mean, I remember when you first met my parents and we were like, like, it was so weird because
5412560	5417720	I kept getting upset because if you're around your parents, like there's no way you can ever
5417720	5420640	become like, you always like prep yourself.
5420640	5423460	You're like, okay, now I'm 58.
5423460	5425560	My parents are almost dead.
5425560	5428640	I definitely am done with this.
5428640	5430600	I'm not going to start acting like a child.
5430600	5434120	And then we started playing catchphrase with my parents and my, I was on my mom's team
5434120	5436000	and she was like, I don't know, tweeting bird.
5436000	5437000	And I'm like, good.
5437000	5445840	The buzzer went off and I went, you can't, uh, where did that come from?
5446840	5455040	I called my mom the C word because she couldn't guess what Tweety Bird was or something.
5455040	5459280	But it was because, it was because within three minutes of her arriving, like in front
5459280	5464160	of Erin, like my mom has this weird like capacity for, she doesn't understand what she's doing.
5464160	5468720	She could figure out how to call you fat, like, like without, she's like Houdini of
5468720	5469720	calling you fat.
5469720	5471400	Like the key was in my cheek.
5471400	5472400	It was in my boot.
5472400	5475400	It was a sort of, she knows, like, there's no way I can do it.
5475400	5478520	There's no way she goes, like, she has to call me fat somehow.
5478520	5482400	Like, she always figures it out within three minutes of like, let me know how much weight
5482400	5483400	I've gained.
5483400	5484400	And I was just like, it's unbelievable.
5484400	5488440	And then I swallow that down and then I'm like, I mean, they say to not date a man who has
5488440	5492880	issues with his mother, but, but the gag became like double down.
5492880	5496640	So I was, I was like, start, I was getting, I was getting jostled.
5496640	5500800	And then we were, we were, we were, we were not married yet.
5500800	5504720	We were very much, you know, we were, we were fresh to say very much in love.
5504720	5510400	I was going to say very much in love and then I was like, okay.
5510400	5511400	And so we would, we,
5511400	5514120	Before I really got things changed with Steve and
5514120	5517880	I was getting riled up, but then I would get riled up and I would like, it would start
5517880	5525040	to spill over into Aaron and then you, that you were, you were like, Hey, I love you.
5525040	5526240	And then I would go, I love you.
5526240	5528600	And it was like, but it was sort of like a joke.
5528600	5529600	It was kind of ironic.
5529600	5534320	And then my dad was like, like, like started doing the joke of everyone was just saying,
5534320	5535320	I love you.
5535320	5539240	And that became the running joke is anytime someone started to get upset, everyone would
5539240	5540760	just say, I love you.
5540760	5548560	So it was a joke, but we, but that we all operated as a healthy family for, it was insane.
5548560	5553880	It was like a bit like, let's do that bit where we stop getting angry and say, I love
5553880	5554880	you.
5554880	5555880	It was insane.
5555880	5556880	Like that's how we needed to parse it.
5556880	5558640	Was this before you called your mom a cunt or after?
5558680	5563760	No, it was, I mean, it was around it was during, I was like, like, like, I mean, like, like
5563760	5567560	ordinarily, I think what happened is I called my mom a cunt and then, and then I said, I
5567560	5568560	love you.
5568560	5574280	I, I've never, I've never told you this and I had forgotten about it, but I was going
5574280	5580520	through my old, uh, iPad pictures and I had my iPad with me that night and I have a picture
5580520	5585200	that's a selfie because, you know, uh, I'm assuming I'm not the only one who takes pictures
5585200	5589200	of themselves in moments that are like, Oh God, like remember that moment when you were
5589200	5595400	here in this place and, uh, there's a picture of me, like wide eyed, um, I'll post it somewhere
5595400	5603000	with like Dan and his parents in the background and I'm just like, this is where you are.
5603000	5607480	This is this moment, either, either in three years you'll be married or, uh, you'll be
5607480	5610000	telling stories about this insane, insane night.
5610000	5614200	Oh, I did not know that you were going through that.
5614200	5617200	I thought you were like this, like, like, like, like earth goddess.
5617200	5621720	That was like your tendrils were just affecting us and that we were psycho, like, and it wasn't
5621720	5622720	affecting you.
5622720	5627280	I didn't even know that you were like, Oh my God, I mean, please don't take back calling
5627280	5628280	me an earth goddess.
5628280	5629280	I'll kill myself.
5629280	5631280	Um, wait, I am an earth goddess.
5631280	5635920	Uh, no, no, I mean, I mean, no, no, I, I was having, I was having, I wasn't having a bad
5635920	5641900	time, but I was, there was obviously like so much tension and it was, Dan's mom was calling
5641900	5647020	and fat and it was very strange and Dan's dad was on my team and would kiss me after
5647020	5648020	every round.
5648020	5653060	And I'm like, what is, but not in that way, but in a like, like, Hey, I don't, I don't
5653060	5654060	know.
5654060	5660940	He's a, he's kind of, um, Hey, you know, kiss, kiss, like, what kind of, what kind of kiss,
5660940	5666900	like a pecking the cheek, no, I don't, um, no, I wasn't even making a hitting joke.
5666900	5670860	I was, I was imagining someone's like licking someone's fist for some reason.
5670860	5675100	It's like a, why am I sharing these thoughts?
5675100	5680900	Uh, just no, but it was just a, just a, just a kiss, just a like, late kiss on the list.
5680900	5681900	But it was a different memory.
5681900	5686580	I have, I was like, like, like, like, like, but that's not entirely fair to my dad because
5686580	5691400	there was a point where it was like, cause you two were such assholes together because
5691400	5695140	you were winning good players and you're both incredibly competitive.
5695140	5700060	I learned how to play poker for my dad and I learned how to cheat from my dad because
5700060	5701060	he would cheat.
5701060	5704140	And the only way I learned how to cheat was by catching him cheating.
5704140	5710460	My dad would play poker with children and cheat, like he would like stand up and I'd
5710460	5713140	be like ace of hearts under your ass.
5713140	5714380	You fucking dick.
5714380	5718820	Like he was, he would take IOUs from us and I would like mow the lawn, I'm like, here's
5718820	5719820	your $5.
5719820	5722140	Like, like, like it's fucking my dad.
5722140	5723140	Yeah.
5723140	5729220	But, but like, you know, he was a good sport about it, but all right, I cheated like, like,
5729260	5736580	but, and obviously I'm like, but, but you and him way more similar than you, like, comfortable
5736580	5738320	and you were winning at catchphrase.
5738320	5741860	So the two of you erupted in an amorous fit.
5741860	5745100	There was a round where, so there was a round where my mom couldn't get tweeting bird and
5745100	5746780	I'm like, you can't.
5746780	5751140	And the next round is like, my dad was like, it's like a guy and it's like Saturday Night
5751140	5752140	Fever.
5752140	5753140	You're like John Travolta and you're both like, yay.
5753140	5755980	And you made out.
5755980	5760420	And it was your choice, like, cause you were very excited.
5760420	5762060	I did not initiate.
5762060	5765380	No, there was a, but I remember, let's not rewrite history.
5765380	5771500	Like you fucking made out with my dad and it's because you guys are the same person.
5771500	5775500	And like, like you're so competitive.
5775500	5785940	I just wanted to see what it would be like and obviously it turned me on.
5786900	5787900	Obviously.
5787900	5790820	Why wouldn't I, why would I remember it if it didn't?
5790820	5791820	I'm going to go.
5791820	5792820	I'm going to go.
5792820	5793820	Let's cut the show early.
5793820	5798660	I'm going to go jerk off to Aaron making out with my dad during catchphrase.
5798660	5801680	And no, all right.
5801680	5806340	So like we started a little late, but I imagine there's another show after this.
5806340	5808900	So we can't go like over.
5808900	5812180	There's an option.
5812180	5815620	It's up to you.
5815620	5819500	There's like someone in the back going, who do these people know what they're doing?
5819500	5822860	I'm sure there's some guy coming in that's like, you know, going to sweat it if we fuck
5822860	5823860	up.
5823860	5828780	But so, so we should definitely try to, uh, I'm sure these people probably want to see
5828780	5835300	us do a proper, uh, Shadowrun time, you guys role playing, right?
5835300	5836300	Why not?
5836300	5838140	I'm enjoying Shadowrun as a game.
5838140	5840100	I think I like the Shadowrun world.
5840100	5845100	It's like, uh, it's, it's, it seems like it's just a good time.
5846100	5853980	I felt, I felt, I felt a little forded during our, uh, our Bigfoot campaign when I tried
5853980	5857100	to, uh, talk to chipmunks, I came down on you too hard.
5857100	5860540	I, it was because my ambition, my ambition is the enemy of my friendships.
5860540	5862540	I should be more intimate in the moment with you guys.
5862540	5864300	I should not plan ahead.
5864300	5865300	I'm a megalomaniac.
5865300	5867500	I try to control things.
5867500	5868500	It's interesting.
5868500	5872220	Like you were trying to meet Sasquatch by shooing him away and try to beat Spencer to
5872220	5873220	the contrarian punch.
5873220	5877900	And I was trying to meet, uh, the best way I knew how to meet, uh, a mythological beast
5877900	5880300	was by being in the mythological universe.
5880300	5884420	Yeah, that's deep.
5884420	5885420	I don't believe that.
5885420	5886420	I think you're lying.
5886420	5891980	I think I, I feel like you just wanted to have an emerald dagger and low light vision.
5891980	5892980	I did.
5892980	5893980	Yeah.
5893980	5894980	I don't think you thought that was going to attract Bigfoot.
5894980	5898900	No, I thought that that would be the fastest way you use low light vision and an emerald
5898900	5901300	dagger to meet and then communicate with chipmunks.
5901300	5902300	Yeah.
5902300	5908300	If you knew how dumb that sounded, I like you, but you, you, you know, you know, chipmunks
5908300	5909300	aren't going to help you.
5909300	5910300	That was just you.
5910300	5912420	You were like, I need to, I need to have an edge.
5912420	5916860	You were like, communicate with the forest and like, like link into the, the, be Steve.
5916860	5917860	Huh?
5917860	5918860	Be Steve.
5918860	5919860	Be Steve.
5919860	5920860	Yeah.
5920860	5921860	Just try it.
5921860	5922860	Oh, no.
5922860	5923860	She's saying, yeah.
5923860	5928980	Say, Hey man, and offer to get me high because you're like, now I'm turning into an asshole.
5928980	5929980	All right.
5930660	5934780	Dan, you want to pass down the character sheet so we can kick this motherfucker off?
5934780	5937780	No, I wasn't really mad.
5937780	5938780	I know.
5938780	5939780	Okay.
5939780	5940780	All right.
5940780	5941780	I didn't want to have a moment backstage.
5941780	5942780	You're like, wait, what?
5942780	5946700	No, we were both, we were both trying to help in different ways and it was, it was cross
5946700	5947700	purposes.
5947700	5948700	Yeah.
5948700	5949700	So who is Steve playing?
5949700	5950700	That will he be Dr. Friend?
5950700	5952300	I think I gave him Dr. Friend.
5952300	5953300	Yeah.
5953300	5954300	All right.
5954300	5958460	I walked by those same two homeless guys earlier today and they called me beautiful.
5959460	5960460	Yeah.
5960460	5962460	Were those the guys that like my coat probably?
5962460	5963460	Yeah.
5963460	5964460	Yeah.
5964460	5965460	They called, they called me, it's like speaking to the vanity thing.
5965460	5967220	They called me beautiful and I was like, Oh, thank you.
5967220	5970020	And then I passed by them another time and I was kind of like, here it goes again.
5970020	5971020	And they didn't say anything.
5971020	5980940	And I may have even brushed my hair before I turned the corner.
5980940	5982940	Oh, Portland.
5982940	5984620	I'm enjoying your puritanical outfit, Aaron.
5984620	5985620	I mean that.
5985620	5986620	Like, I like that look on you.
5986620	5987620	Thank you.
5987620	5988620	Yeah.
5988620	5989620	I don't know.
5989620	5990620	Yeah.
5990620	5991620	What, what is, what is, what is sexy about that?
5991620	5995900	I, I, I, because I, I saw you like very beautiful and I, I don't know what it is because it's
5995900	5997740	like not typically like, I don't know.
5997740	6001860	I like the clean lines.
6001860	6002860	Thank you.
6002860	6003860	Thank you.
6003860	6004860	You like the clean line.
6004860	6005860	Yeah.
6005860	6006860	Simple.
6006860	6007860	Yeah.
6007860	6008860	Maybe this is the, yeah.
6008860	6015060	The unbridled kind of stability, unbridled stability, unbridled, it's your new perfume,
6015060	6016060	right?
6016060	6017060	Yeah.
6017500	6021060	That would be the worst title to our podcast of all time.
6021060	6023420	She takes no chances.
6023420	6024420	She's reliable.
6024420	6026780	Where unbridled meets sensitivity.
6026780	6031080	She doesn't go out because it's unsafe.
6031080	6032300	She believes in witches.
6032300	6033300	She might be one.
6033300	6034300	She might not.
6034300	6037300	All right, Spencer, shall we let's?
6037300	6038300	Shall we let's?
6038300	6039300	Do we have a guest?
6039300	6044740	Do we need a guest backup artist or a, yeah, Teo from Finland.
6044740	6045740	Teo from Finland.
6045740	6046740	Yeah, I don't know.
6047100	6048100	Is that, is that a character?
6048100	6050500	It's the new character Dan's playing.
6050500	6053620	No, it's, he wrote, he wrote the recap.
6053620	6055620	Oh, Teo from Finland wrote the recap.
6055620	6056620	Sorry.
6056620	6060220	We invite people to write our recaps if you ever want to write what Spencer does and recaps
6060220	6061620	our last venture.
6061620	6065780	I was asking if we needed somebody, I'm wasting our, our last 10 minutes.
6065780	6068180	I was asking if we needed anybody to play anybody.
6068180	6070380	Are we missing a character, Spencer?
6070380	6072700	I mean, yeah, but it's fine.
6072700	6074220	Let's just do it.
6074220	6076300	We have a, like a gang of friends upstairs.
6076300	6077820	We can bring somebody else down if you want.
6077820	6078820	We got, yep.
6078820	6079820	Yeah.
6079820	6082820	Hey, is Jonah, Jonah Ray here?
6082820	6085820	Jonah, you want to come down?
6085820	6087820	Jonah Ray, everybody.
6087820	6088820	Oh, no.
6088820	6089820	Oh, no.
6089820	6090820	Oh, this guy.
6090820	6091820	Oh, no.
6091820	6092820	Oh, no.
6092820	6093820	Oh, no.
6093820	6094820	Oh, no.
6094820	6095820	Oh, no.
6095820	6096820	Oh, no.
6096820	6097820	Oh, no.
6097820	6098820	Oh, no.
6098820	6099820	Oh, no.
6099820	6100820	Oh, no.
6100820	6101820	Oh, no.
6101820	6102820	Oh, no.
6102820	6103820	Oh, no.
6104820	6105820	Freestyle, Jonah.
6105820	6106820	Freestyle.
6109420	6111420	Pattern shirts.
6111420	6115420	Man, that song just got me so fucking pumped.
6115420	6116420	It did.
6116420	6118420	It did feel like it was a different kind of show.
6118420	6120420	Like, maybe we should have come out to that.
6120420	6121420	Yeah.
6121420	6122420	All right.
6122420	6123420	Play it again.
6123420	6124420	Play it again.
6124420	6125420	Let's fucking fire this up.
6125420	6126420	From the top?
6126420	6127420	From the top?
6127420	6128420	Just for a second.
6128420	6129420	Just for a one.
6129420	6130420	Yeah.
6130420	6131420	June night blade rap.
6131420	6132420	June night blade.
6132420	6133420	Yeah.
6133420	6134420	Fuck it.
6134420	6135420	Fuck, fuck.
6135420	6138420	Yo, Portland, I'm the ocean.
6138420	6141420	Yo, I like to eat seafood.
6141420	6143420	I got your mama and I'm in the mood.
6143420	6147420	I'm gonna go to the Northwest and cut down some wood.
6147420	6150420	I'm gonna find big food.
6150420	6156420	I'm gonna camp with your mama, gonna fuck her and ride away on a llama.
6156420	6158420	Dumb, dumb rhyme.
6158420	6161420	Yo, yo, it's Portland time.
6161420	6164420	I want to have a massage and fly a kite.
6164420	6168420	I'm gonna walk my dog but walk the fucker right.
6168420	6173420	It's a pretty flat place with a lot of stuff for your dog.
6173420	6175420	Space, floor space.
6175420	6179420	Yo, yo, golden doodle.
6179420	6182420	Yo, golden doodle.
6182420	6185420	Spring, spring, spring, springer spaniel.
6186420	6191420	I got a big dog, a working breed, and I saw logs.
6191420	6195420	My dog's real smart but he doesn't think that I don't have a heart
6195420	6200420	because he's got lots of land to walk in and I'm in Portland.
6200420	6202420	Have a donut.
6206420	6207420	Nice.
6207420	6210420	Don't patronize me.
6210420	6211420	Nice.
6212420	6214420	I appreciate, I understand.
6214420	6216420	You paid $100.
6216420	6220420	I understand you need to think that was entertaining.
6220420	6222420	I don't want to deflect a compliment.
6222420	6224420	People stood in line for three hours for that right.
6224420	6226420	But don't debase yourself.
6226420	6229420	You have Stockholm Syndrome.
6229420	6231420	It was a bad rap.
6231420	6234420	You admire a bad person.
6234420	6238420	Everything you think is entertaining is bad.
6238420	6240420	Have a good week.
6241420	6243420	Hey, Jonah.
6243420	6244420	Hi, Jonah.
6244420	6246420	How's it going?
6246420	6248420	I'm glad I inspired Freestyle Rap.
6248420	6250420	It happens to me all the time.
6250420	6253420	Which character is Jonah going to play for us, Spencer?
6253420	6254420	I got...
6254420	6255420	What's his name?
6255420	6256420	Hoardegard.
6256420	6258420	Hoardegard, of course.
6258420	6260420	We were joking at breakfast.
6260420	6263420	Jonah Ray, his last name is Ray,
6263420	6266420	so we were talking about what you call your fans.
6266420	6268420	Like the people that like Bones, Heart Hanson,
6268420	6270420	calls them boneheads.
6270420	6273420	And that Jonah Ray, jokingly at one point,
6273420	6276420	addressed his fans as rapists.
6279420	6281420	It was a real bad idea.
6281420	6284420	Every once in a while a guy still comes up to him
6284420	6286420	in like a fabric store and is like,
6286420	6289420	hey man, I've been a rapist for five years.
6289420	6291420	I really like your...
6291420	6292420	No, no, no, not here.
6292420	6295420	Not at the fabric store, which I commonly frequent.
6297420	6300420	Anywhere but here.
6300420	6302420	I was a rapist before I met my wife,
6302420	6305420	but then I turned her on to it and now she's a rapist too.
6306420	6309420	The only other option is Jonah racist,
6309420	6311420	and I don't know if that's even any better.
6311420	6314420	I'm a Jonah racist. Oh, no.
6314420	6316420	All right, so you know the rules.
6316420	6318420	You have a sheet of paper full of arithmetic
6318420	6320420	that you're too drunk to read,
6320420	6324420	and Spencer is a beleaguered genius that suffers through...
6324420	6326420	Hey, that's very kind.
6326420	6328420	That's not a joke.
6329420	6331420	I appreciate it. I love you.
6331420	6333420	I love you. Thank you.
6333420	6335420	I love you too.
6335420	6337420	He says staring into the bottle...
6337420	6339420	I can't look at you, but I love you.
6340420	6342420	Look up in the eye and say it, Dan.
6342420	6343420	Make eye contact with Spencer.
6343420	6346420	Make eye contact with Steve and say it.
6346420	6348420	That I love you? Yeah.
6350420	6353420	Steve... What? I love Spencer.
6355420	6358420	What the fuck?
6359420	6361420	He wasn't even...
6361420	6363420	That was just an abuse of Steve.
6363420	6365420	All right.
6365420	6367420	Spencer, I got you high.
6369420	6372420	This is what weed brings.
6373420	6375420	All right, Spencer, you ready to rock?
6375420	6378420	Here we go. A little Shadow Run.
6379420	6381420	Yeah. Yeah.
6381420	6382420	Shadow Run.
6382420	6384420	Circuitry.
6384420	6386420	Neuromancer inspired by William Gibson.
6386420	6390420	Fucked your mom so hard, she had some lips and...
6391420	6393420	Shit.
6394420	6396420	Okay.
6397420	6399420	Last time on Shadow Run.
6399420	6401420	The gang was back at the bar
6401420	6405420	where they found a mysterious magenta-clad man
6405420	6407420	with a bow and arrow.
6407420	6409420	Meanwhile, Jim sat in the car
6409420	6411420	regarding the restrained Arturo.
6411420	6413420	Not convinced with his reassurances,
6413420	6416420	Nightblade went John Travolta in the back seat
6416420	6418420	and blew the helpless gangster's brains out
6418420	6421420	before throwing the stiff in the nearest dumpster.
6422420	6425420	The gang's fixer, Teddy, revealed
6425420	6429420	he hired a brooding bowman hacker called HackEye
6429420	6432420	who was around to help with scrubbing surveillance data
6432420	6434420	and destroying digital evidence.
6434420	6436420	Then the gang found themselves a new gig
6436420	6440420	acquiring Baldwin Brown's research from a brain clinic
6440420	6445420	secured with vibration sensors, cameras, and guards.
6445420	6448420	The runners agreed to jump in HackEye, whatever that meant.
6448420	6452420	But would his prowess help them pull off their first clean Shadow Run?
6452420	6455420	Would he be able to keep deflecting Mercy's moves
6455420	6457420	or would he get his boffin's balls kissed?
6457420	6460420	Find out. Harman time.
6460420	6462420	Thank you.
6462420	6470420	Thanks again to Theo from Finland.
6470420	6472420	Yeah.
6472420	6475420	So you guys, you're at Hank's last stand.
6475420	6477420	It's a rusty old bar.
6477420	6478420	You're in the middle.
6478420	6481420	You got HackEye, the magenta-clad stranger with a bow and arrow
6481420	6483420	sitting drinking a water,
6483420	6486420	and you guys just got your mission from Mr. Johnson.
6486420	6488420	The mission again is to do what, sorry?
6488420	6491420	You got to retrieve research files
6491420	6494420	that belong to Baldwin Brown from the confines
6494420	6500420	of Mind Plus Limited, the brain clinic.
6500420	6503420	Can you refresh me on what we had done to Baldwin Brown?
6503420	6504420	Did we just hand him over?
6504420	6505420	You hand him over to a company.
6505420	6507420	You sold him to a company.
6507420	6508420	Yeah.
6508420	6510420	And so there's files belonging to him that we want.
6510420	6512420	These files are in Mind Plus Limited.
6512420	6514420	Yeah, they're his research.
6514420	6516420	And they kind of scolded us on our last link.
6516420	6518420	Not them. That was Teddy.
6518420	6519420	Oh, okay.
6519420	6521420	I just care about you guys.
6521420	6522420	All right.
6522420	6525420	Yeah, we're kind of like bad shadow runners.
6525420	6527420	Like, we were just told,
6527420	6530420	good job, you finished, but your score is low.
6530420	6534420	I pulled the whole team aside, except for HackEye,
6534420	6537420	whom we've just met, and we're told it will be helpful.
6537420	6540420	And we said, like, when we talked about jumping this guy in,
6540420	6542420	like, how do we know we can trust this guy?
6542420	6544420	There must be some sort of procedure.
6544420	6547420	Well, he was recommended by Cool Ted Teddy.
6547420	6548420	Right?
6548420	6549420	Yeah.
6549420	6552420	I mean, we can do what we did when we first met,
6552420	6554420	when we were testing each other.
6554420	6556420	Give him an old Tennessee reach around.
6556420	6558420	Tennessee witch rat, yeah.
6558420	6561420	A Tennessee reach around.
6561420	6565420	Yeah, let's take him out back.
6565420	6568420	Let's all give him a Tennessee reach around.
6568420	6570420	Yes, yeah.
6570420	6572420	We all wink at each other knowingly.
6572420	6573420	Yeah.
6573420	6574420	Yeah.
6574420	6575420	Who's playing?
6575420	6577420	Are we about to rape somebody?
6577420	6579420	I don't understand what the fuck is it.
6579420	6581420	What the fuck is a Tennessee reach around?
6581420	6582420	Is someone playing this character?
6582420	6583420	I love Jotiray.
6583420	6584420	I love Jotiray.
6584420	6585420	It's kind of pretty edgy.
6585420	6586420	It's kind of pretty edgy.
6586420	6589420	As I remember the Tennessee reach around,
6589420	6592420	what it is is we say, like, we're going to trust each other,
6592420	6597420	and the hardest thing to do ever is to have someone behind you.
6597420	6598420	Right.
6598420	6599420	And so...
6599420	6602420	How can everybody in a group always have
6602420	6603420	someone watching their back?
6603420	6604420	Yeah.
6604420	6606420	And the answer is the Tennessee reach around.
6606420	6608420	We hold a weapon in our right hand,
6608420	6612420	and we make them expose some skin on their stomach,
6612420	6615420	and we say, I'm not going to hurt you there.
6615420	6616420	You have to stand still.
6616420	6618420	And if they stand still for a minute and believe you,
6618420	6621420	then they get that weapon.
6621420	6624420	And they get to join the team.
6624420	6626420	And then we reach around.
6626420	6628420	That's the Tennessee reach around.
6628420	6629420	There's no reaching around.
6629420	6631420	Or Tennessee.
6631420	6633420	It started in Tennessee.
6634420	6635420	I thought...
6637420	6638420	Yes, and.
6642420	6643420	I caught myself.
6643420	6647420	Were you about to tell everyone to get out of there, get...
6647420	6649420	No, I was going to pitch a different thing, but...
6649420	6650420	That's true.
6650420	6651420	I mean, if you remember it differently.
6651420	6652420	I mean, it's been so long.
6652420	6656420	I thought it was when we all got in a kind of like leapfrog type line
6656420	6659420	where everyone gets to experience someone whispering in their ear,
6659420	6661420	I've got your back, bro.
6661420	6664420	And then you go around so that everyone knows
6664420	6666420	that everyone's got their back.
6666420	6668420	You could just stand in a circle.
6669420	6670420	And say, I got your back to...
6670420	6672420	Then everyone's behind everyone else's back.
6672420	6673420	Oh, yeah.
6673420	6674420	Oh, God damn it.
6674420	6675420	I already...
6675420	6676420	Wait, who are you?
6676420	6677420	Hordergaard.
6677420	6678420	My name's Hordergaard.
6678420	6679420	Oh, okay.
6679420	6681420	Yeah, he's the smart one.
6681420	6682420	Yeah, let's do it in a circle.
6682420	6685420	Okay, we all go out in the parking lot in the back,
6685420	6688420	and we get in a circle, and on a count of three,
6688420	6690420	we're all going to say, I got you back.
6690420	6691420	Yeah, all right.
6691420	6692420	Okay.
6692420	6694420	One, two...
6694420	6696420	Do we say it on three or one, two, three, go?
6696420	6698420	We'll say it on the four...
6698420	6699420	One, two, three, four, yeah.
6699420	6700420	Whatever word four would be.
6700420	6701420	But don't say four.
6701420	6702420	Can I just ask before we do this?
6702420	6704420	I mean, should we jerk each other off?
6704420	6705420	Well, no.
6705420	6706420	That's only if we...
6706420	6708420	That's the tendency to reach around.
6708420	6709420	A lot of people ask that.
6709420	6711420	That's what we get if we do this right.
6711420	6712420	Shouldn't we have a secret?
6712420	6714420	No, this isn't...
6714420	6716420	I say, can I make a pitch?
6716420	6717420	Yeah.
6717420	6718420	When we...
6718420	6720420	One, two, three, we all whisper gently,
6720420	6722420	I got you back, and then if you want to start
6722420	6723420	jerking somebody off, you can.
6723420	6725420	But you only got eight seconds.
6725420	6727420	That's called a Tennessee Reach Around
6727420	6729420	with a Seattle finish.
6731420	6732420	I don't know.
6732420	6733420	I thought maybe they hated Seattle.
6733420	6734420	Who's standing behind me?
6734420	6735420	I took a chance.
6735420	6737420	Who's standing behind who?
6737420	6738420	Who's standing behind who?
6738420	6741420	I'm standing behind Hoardingard for sure.
6744420	6746420	All right.
6746420	6747420	So one, two, three, I got you back.
6747420	6749420	If you want to jerk somebody off, eight seconds,
6749420	6750420	and then we're done.
6750420	6751420	But you can't make them.
6751420	6752420	Right, otherwise we...
6752420	6753420	They have to be exposed.
6753420	6754420	They have to...
6754420	6755420	They have to want it.
6755420	6757420	So if you want to expose yourself in that moment
6757420	6758420	and put your hand around...
6758420	6761420	I guess the cleanest way to do this is for us
6761420	6763420	to all take our pants down before we start this.
6763420	6764420	Yeah, that's the only way.
6764420	6765420	That's the only way.
6765420	6766420	Dicks out.
6766420	6767420	Dicks out?
6767420	6768420	Right.
6768420	6769420	I'm sorry to continue.
6769420	6770420	I'm a woman, so I...
6770420	6771420	Yeah, we're both women.
6771420	6774420	I'm gonna say, you know, I don't...
6774420	6776420	It's a lot more invasive to be entered
6776420	6777420	as opposed to just, like, tug.
6777420	6779420	So maybe just, like, a pat?
6779420	6780420	Entered.
6780420	6783420	Also, I'm a dwarf, so are you gonna be able
6783420	6786420	to reach down and around?
6786420	6787420	Most certainly.
6787420	6789420	Okay, good.
6789420	6791420	How can the person in front of you let you know
6791420	6795420	that they're open to this if we're all dropping our pants?
6795420	6799420	Everyone that's available for this do pigtails.
6799420	6800420	Well, when we count to three,
6800420	6803420	you pull up your pants if you don't want it.
6803420	6805420	On the count of three...
6805420	6807420	On the count of three...
6807420	6808420	I have to urinate really bad,
6808420	6809420	so nothing might come out.
6809420	6810420	Oh, my God, me too.
6810420	6811420	I gotta go to the bathroom really quick.
6811420	6813420	What if you pee instead of cum?
6813420	6814420	Exactly.
6814420	6815420	What is the difference?
6815420	6817420	On the count of three, everybody close your eyes.
6817420	6818420	If you want to take your pants down,
6818420	6820420	you take your pants down.
6820420	6821420	Then we open our eyes.
6821420	6822420	You look at the person in front of you.
6822420	6823420	If their pants are down,
6823420	6825420	that means they're open for the Tennessee Reach round
6825420	6826420	with Seattle finish.
6826420	6827420	Okay.
6827420	6828420	Then we count to three again,
6828420	6829420	and then we say, I got your back,
6829420	6830420	and then if you want to jerk somebody off,
6830420	6831420	eight seconds...
6831420	6832420	Why don't we all just fuck?
6833420	6835420	It's clearly what we're trying to get at,
6835420	6836420	and we're not doing it.
6836420	6838420	We're just playing these games.
6838420	6840420	Also, don't we already know each other?
6841420	6843420	Yeah, like we're jumping a stranger in,
6843420	6844420	but we're like really...
6844420	6845420	But we all do, we all...
6845420	6847420	We don't believe in hazing.
6847420	6848420	We believe in like...
6848420	6851420	We're a new group if we're bringing somebody in.
6851420	6853420	A new techno-mancer we've just met at the bar.
6853420	6854420	We don't know this guy.
6854420	6855420	So he's a robot?
6855420	6857420	He's part machine, part man, right?
6857420	6860420	So he's the one that we can't even jerk off?
6861420	6866420	Maybe he's a jerk-off machine.
6867420	6869420	I will tell you that in a Tennessee reach-around,
6869420	6871420	there is a phrase we use for the guy
6871420	6873420	that doesn't drop his own pants
6873420	6877420	and then is willing to jerk off the person in front of him.
6877420	6878420	What's that phrase?
6878420	6879420	The Robert E. Lee's.
6880420	6881420	Republican!
6881420	6882420	Okay, come on.
6883420	6884420	I know, exactly.
6884420	6886420	They're not conservative.
6886420	6888420	They just hate hat comedy.
6891420	6892420	Let's do it.
6892420	6894420	Okay, wait, so hold on.
6895420	6896420	We count to three.
6896420	6897420	Close your eyes.
6897420	6898420	Count to three.
6898420	6899420	Drop your pants or not.
6899420	6900420	Take your pants off or not.
6900420	6901420	Okay.
6901420	6902420	Then we count to three again.
6902420	6903420	Open your eyes.
6903420	6904420	Look at the person in front of you.
6904420	6905420	If their pants are down,
6905420	6908420	that means they're willing to get the Seattle finish
6908420	6910420	from the Tennessee reach-around.
6910420	6911420	So it's one, two, three, go.
6911420	6912420	How are we going to show...
6912420	6914420	Okay, so if your pants are down,
6914420	6915420	you raise your hands.
6915420	6916420	So we have to close our eyes.
6916420	6917420	No, no.
6917420	6918420	You don't have to raise your hands.
6918420	6919420	Your pants are down.
6919420	6921420	I'm saying, to represent it on stage,
6921420	6922420	we should raise our hands.
6922420	6923420	Okay.
6923420	6924420	Yeah.
6924420	6925420	So we close our eyes.
6926420	6927420	Who's that?
6928420	6930420	Is Hakai even with you?
6931420	6932420	Is Hakai even with you?
6932420	6933420	I know.
6933420	6934420	Hakai is like the audience right now
6934420	6935420	and is just like, what?
6935420	6937420	Hakai walked away as we've been trying to...
6937420	6938420	Can we have somebody else, right?
6938420	6941420	No, he didn't get invited out back with you guys.
6941420	6942420	Oh, shit, he's still at the bar.
6942420	6943420	That's good, though.
6943420	6944420	That's good.
6944420	6945420	We should go get him now
6945420	6946420	that we know what we're doing.
6946420	6948420	Should we have Craig come back up first?
6948420	6949420	Craig, are you here?
6949420	6951420	While we're waiting, can't we all just practice
6951420	6953420	our Tennessee Reacharounds?
6953420	6954420	Yeah, we should practice.
6954420	6955420	We should do a practice round.
6955420	6956420	I think so.
6956420	6957420	All right.
6957420	6958420	Close your eyes.
6958420	6961420	One, two, three.
6965420	6966420	And I'm inside.
6966420	6967420	Oh, come on, Erin.
6967420	6968420	I'm inside.
6968420	6969420	All right.
6969420	6970420	Well, this is going to work out easy.
6970420	6971420	Okay.
6971420	6972420	All right.
6972420	6973420	Good job, guys.
6973420	6974420	Okay.
6974420	6975420	So, no, I have to...
6975420	6976420	I'm grabbing him.
6976420	6977420	You got Hakai?
6977420	6979420	Hakai, can we talk to you outside?
6979420	6980420	Yeah.
6980420	6981420	All right.
6981420	6982420	This way.
6982420	6983420	Just be open-minded.
6983420	6984420	Okay.
6986420	6987420	Oh, hey, man.
6987420	6988420	Hey.
6990420	6994420	Hakai, I'm going to explain to him what's going down,
6994420	6997420	but we're going to do our ritual.
6997420	6998420	Have you ever been to Tennessee?
6998420	7000420	I feel like it's pretty self-explanatory,
7000420	7002420	but lay it out for her.
7002420	7005420	Spencer at the bar at one point was like,
7005420	7007420	I forgot my Shadowrun notes.
7007420	7009420	I'm like, don't worry about it.
7009420	7014420	I think we're going to be fine.
7014420	7015420	What if we saw...
7015420	7017420	Like, he got his notes and we looked at it,
7017420	7018420	and it was like...
7018420	7019420	Everything.
7019420	7021420	Like, needlessly argue about jerking each other off.
7021420	7022420	Yeah, like a whole map.
7022420	7023420	Exactly.
7023420	7024420	Yeah.
7024420	7026420	It's like three seconds, then raise your hand.
7026420	7027420	You know what?
7027420	7028420	Let's stand in the circle.
7028420	7031420	Hakai, part of this is just trusting each other.
7031420	7032420	And I'm not going to...
7032420	7034420	I'm going to explain this, and we're going to go
7034420	7035420	one, two, three.
7035420	7036420	We're going to do it.
7036420	7039420	You were here when we decided who was going to take our pants off.
7039420	7041420	Oh, oh yeah.
7041420	7042420	I don't know.
7042420	7043420	We had our eyes closed.
7043420	7044420	Basically everybody.
7044420	7045420	Everybody.
7045420	7047420	But we should count to three and give them the opportunity, right?
7047420	7048420	Yeah, yeah.
7048420	7054420	So, at the count of three, if you want to get jerked off...
7054420	7057420	Or, no, if you want to be in this brotherhood.
7057420	7061420	We're the toughest gang in town.
7061420	7064420	It honestly is if you want to get jerked off, because it's not...
7064420	7065420	It doesn't preclude...
7065420	7066420	Also, are you guys hard?
7066420	7067420	Like, how is this working?
7067420	7068420	Are we like...
7068420	7069420	That's none of your business.
7069420	7070420	Well, it will be in a moment.
7070420	7071420	I'm a woman.
7071420	7072420	I'm a woman.
7072420	7073420	So, yes.
7073420	7074420	Right.
7074420	7075420	So, it is okay.
7075420	7082420	This is one of the moments when I imagine a floating mom head with her eyes just...
7082420	7085420	You could have been a lawyer.
7085420	7090420	And a floating hand coming up above the head.
7091420	7100420	I mean, there are gangs who beat the crap out of their new people, which is a dumb move.
7100420	7103420	In terms of Darwinism, it's like, oh, this new guy.
7103420	7106420	Let's make him physically injured.
7106420	7107420	This is what we do.
7107420	7109420	It's about choice.
7109420	7110420	There's no wrong answer.
7110420	7113420	Or so you don't know.
7113420	7114420	Let's get in the circle.
7114420	7115420	All right.
7115420	7116420	Let's do it.
7116420	7117420	Get in the circle.
7117420	7118420	All right.
7118420	7119420	Nice.
7119420	7120420	All right.
7120420	7121420	Close.
7121420	7122420	I got your back, bro.
7122420	7123420	I got your back.
7123420	7124420	You got your back.
7124420	7125420	All right.
7125420	7126420	I got your back.
7126420	7127420	Hack guy's in.
7127420	7128420	Hack guy's in.
7128420	7129420	Hack guy's in.
7129420	7130420	Hack guy's in.
7130420	7131420	Who's behind him?
7131420	7132420	I don't know.
7132420	7133420	That's up to you guys.
7133420	7134420	Hack guy likes it.
7134420	7135420	Probably Jeff.
7135420	7136420	You're behind him, right?
7136420	7137420	Yeah.
7137420	7140420	I'm behind you, Hack guy.
7140420	7142420	Oh, that's why he dropped his pants.
7142420	7145420	He's in front of a 19-year-old...
7145420	7146420	It doesn't matter.
7146420	7147420	This is successful.
7147420	7148420	We did it.
7148420	7149420	All right, guys.
7149420	7150420	We did it.
7150420	7151420	Close your eye.
7151420	7152420	Get ready.
7152420	7153420	We all just agreed to jack off Orgy.
7153420	7154420	It's a circle, Jer.
7154420	7155420	All right.
7155420	7156420	So, one, two, three.
7156420	7157420	We all agreed, right?
7157420	7158420	We already did it.
7158420	7159420	We just did it.
7159420	7160420	No, no, no.
7160420	7161420	Now we have to check.
7161420	7162420	No, we were...
7162420	7163420	Yeah.
7163420	7164420	Oh, I thought we...
7164420	7165420	Why are we closing our eyes?
7165420	7166420	Just do it.
7166420	7167420	Yeah.
7167420	7168420	One, two, three.
7168420	7169420	Yeah.
7169420	7170420	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
7170420	7171420	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
7171420	7172420	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
7172420	7173420	Cliffhanger!
7173420	7176420	I got your back.
7176420	7177420	I got your back.
7177420	7178420	I got your back.
7178420	7179420	I got your back.
7179420	7180420	I got your back.
7180420	7181420	I got your back.
7181420	7182420	I got your back.
7182420	7183420	I got your back.
7183420	7184420	Oh, man.
7184420	7185420	Steve Agy.
7185420	7186420	I'm reaching out.
7186420	7187420	Jonah Ray.
7187420	7188420	Aaron McGathey.
7188420	7189420	Spencer Kretzmann.
7189420	7192420	Krayt the Sasquatch Hunter.
7192420	7193420	Thank you.
7193420	7194420	I'm Jeff Davis.
7194420	7195420	Your mayor is Dan Harmon.
7195420	7196420	Thank you so much.
7196420	7197420	Yeah.
7197420	7206420	Can I give a special shout out to...
7207420	7212420	Aaron's first improv art director, Trenton Shine.
7212420	7216420	I think she did really good improv tonight.
7216420	7219420	I would say that was some of the finest shadow running we've ever done.
7219420	7220420	Oh, man.
7220420	7221420	Yeah.
7221420	7222420	We love you, Portland.
7222420	7223420	We love you so much.
7223420	7224420	Thanks for having us.
7224420	7225420	Thanks for coming here.
7225420	7226420	And...
7230420	7232420	Did you get any of that?
7232420	7234420	It's a good show.
