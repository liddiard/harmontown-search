0	18840	Welcome once again to beautiful uptown Burbank, Carmentown is now in session.
18840	29280	Let's welcome to the stage Spencer Crittenden everybody, Spencer Crittenden.
29280	39280	Steve Levy bringing me a cocktail, he'll be back, the mayor of Harman town, you know him, you love him, Mr. Dan Harman.
39280	48280	Thank you. Thank you very much.
48280	56280	My dog was, he was, you know, it's the weekend so and it's like the dog has a dog sitter like all week.
57280	59280	Which dog?
59280	69280	Harvey. Well, I'm talking about Harvey, I'm telling a story about my relationship with Harvey because Nigel gets lots of, I don't know, he's a snuggler and stuff and Harvey's a very large dog.
69280	72280	I don't say that in front of him.
72280	81280	I call them both. I say my two equally normal sized dogs because there's no such thing as a normal dog.
81280	84280	It takes a long time to say and that's why it's kind of exhausting.
84280	109280	And so on the weekends, which is when I'm there the most, like Harvey, who is a creature of warmth and love, like, I don't know, sometimes he gets a little antsy like he thinks maybe when I get up to go get more ice cream or like emergency battery for whatever electronic device I'm staring at.
109280	114280	And then he gets all excited like he thinks maybe I'm going to jog around the block or wrestle a bear with him.
114280	122280	And I was just I was I was going to breakfast today and he got excited and ran over the door because he's like, oh, man, he's going outside.
122280	124280	He's probably like Alice on the dog sitter.
124280	127280	He's probably going to like put a leash on me and go running around with me.
127280	133280	And I looked at him and I said, listen, man, like, you know, you know, the score.
133280	135280	Look, I'm a bad dog owner.
135280	145280	Like I'll just just relax and we're both going to die and I'll see you in heaven.
145280	148280	And I heard myself say that and I thought I was kind of funny.
148280	156280	The idea of dogs going to heaven and then like like, you know, us actually all going to the same heaven because then everything you ate would be in heaven.
156280	161280	And like octopus are like really smart creatures and they'd all be in heaven.
161280	173280	But like there's like a, you know, was I, you know, obviously it's like a six year old thinks of this stuff like but just the idea of all biology merging in heaven,
173280	177280	which is what happens in life because you die and you break down.
177280	181280	So isn't heaven that's heaven's just it doesn't exist and it's nothing.
181280	184280	It's not news to you guys.
185280	188280	I just had to kind of I don't know where that was going to go.
188280	190280	It's just that I didn't want to open the show and go.
190280	193280	So Donald Trump Jr. had this meeting.
193280	196280	I didn't want to like I figured you guys are running from that and I didn't want to go.
196280	197280	So Game of Thrones.
197280	198280	You're missing it.
198280	199280	Thank you so much.
199280	200280	Oh man.
200280	201280	Clearly we took a hit.
201280	203280	This better be a Game of Thrones hit.
203280	204280	Yeah.
204280	206280	We're experiencing game of Thrones yet.
206280	207280	I did.
207280	208280	Oh yeah.
208280	211280	You guys want to know who done.
211280	217280	I say I mean no I don't want spoilers but I I'm enough of an anarchist to want you to spoil it.
217280	221280	No right now.
221280	223280	I was now here's his name.
223280	227280	Rhyme was Ron flow.
227280	229280	I don't know.
229280	232280	Do you guys want my opinion about Lena Dunham's dog.
232280	234280	Dan what's your opinion on Lena Dunham's dog.
234280	235280	I was thinking about that.
235280	236280	I was.
236280	239280	I don't want to know his opinion about whatever he just said.
239280	241280	I was reading the article about it.
241280	245280	I wonder what Dan's opinion on this is a perfect opportunity.
245280	251280	I don't think that I don't think that animal adoption shelters should should do that.
251280	256280	I think that people that want dogs to be happy and end up in good homes should see the bigger picture.
256280	261280	I think I feel like what is Lena Dunham have to do before we stop kicking her in the face.
261280	264280	Like like for what what what did she do.
264280	266280	I don't know what you're talking about.
266280	267280	So hit me to the job.
267280	270280	She's lying about her dog.
270280	273280	She's throwing it around.
273280	276280	She took her dog to she gave up her dog.
276280	279280	She had for four years because she said it was biting.
279280	285280	It was had aggressive behavior and it had a dark past and something.
285280	288280	And whatever whatever whatever she said.
288280	289280	What the fuck.
289280	291280	She's not under oath and she's not a goddamn.
291280	294280	She took like what's the definition of a lie.
294280	296280	She had the dog for four years.
296280	299280	She's giving it up and it bit people.
299280	304280	And then but then there was like this communique issued by the shelter she got it from.
304280	309280	It was like Miss Dunham adopted that dog from us.
309280	313280	We knew it for three weeks and that dog certainly never exhibited.
313280	317280	It was like this big long like Miss Dunham.
317280	322280	Miss Dunham says however according to this animal shelter.
323280	325280	Like like like like they didn't read.
325280	327280	Like what the fuck are you doing.
327280	328280	What are you.
328280	329280	So don't do that.
329280	331280	I thought I want to tell people Nigel got his stitches out.
331280	332280	He's home.
332280	333280	He's safe.
333280	334280	What if the animal hospital was like.
334280	339280	He also had bruises that we couldn't account for.
339280	342280	You had a fucking social worker.
342280	346280	Are you admitting that Nigel has bruises that get me.
346280	348280	He fell.
348280	351280	He keeps falling.
352280	353280	Well wait.
353280	360280	So I thought it was like someone came to interview the shelter being all like oh what's what's the score.
360280	362280	And then someone's like mmm mmm.
362280	363280	No that's not what I saw.
363280	366280	I saw an open letter to the people about fucking someone.
366280	367280	That's true.
367280	368280	That's kind of a bummer.
368280	371280	Yeah I thought someone came and interviewed the guy and he was like here's what I know.
371280	375280	But yeah that's kind of weird if they're like no that's not true.
375280	377280	Well let's just commit to the sadness.
377280	379280	Like I was going to have something happy to talk about.
379280	380280	George Romero died.
380280	381280	Martin Landau died.
381280	382280	Oh yeah.
382280	383280	You know.
383280	384280	Wow.
384280	386280	Romero was one of the first Hollywood meetings I ever had.
386280	387280	Schwab and I came out here.
387280	389280	I can't remember who set it up.
389280	390280	I don't know if it was.
390280	392280	He was with the Gersh Agency back then.
392280	401280	I just remember like wow we're meeting George Romero and he wore his he wears he wore that vest that directors wear to the meeting.
401280	409280	And he he signed a copy of he signed Schwab's Dawn of the Dead I think was.
409280	411280	I can't remember what movie Schwab had him sign.
411280	412280	I don't know.
412280	414280	Why do people deal with celebrity death like that.
414280	421280	Like I worked with him once extra pity that he's dead.
421280	426280	Tony and I had the honor of doing a scene together and surfer ninjas.
426280	430280	Now I'm now it's bad that he's died.
430280	436280	And here's the other thing that everyone does when it's a celebrity like everyone wants to connect the dots.
436280	441280	Like Tony Tony from Tony Johnson died.
441280	443280	Surf's up brother.
443280	444280	Watch out for those ninjas.
444280	445280	Stop that.
445280	447280	Stop it.
447280	450280	Someone was a ghostbuster George Romero died.
450280	454280	You'll be eating brains of your victims in heaven.
454280	459280	But this I guess this leads into this is why I'll finish up because I had an epiphany about this.
459280	461280	I haven't executed this epiphany yet.
461280	463280	I haven't acted on it but my epiphany has been this.
463280	464280	All right.
464280	465280	Are you listening.
465280	466280	Attention.
466280	468280	I'm buckled all the way up.
468280	494280	The reason I've been getting mad at people on Twitter is because for 30 years of Internet usage I have always been assuming this one thing that was going to be a common like assumption among everyone which is that everything that you're saying on the Internet is something that you're implying you would say to my face in real life or out loud in a crowded room.
494280	503280	If you're like broadcasting it and I was just taking a pee at work the other day and I was like because we were talking about the Internet and then I was like I don't know.
503280	510280	It was appeared in epiphany and I like we have all the time and it's like I think the warm water leaves your body and your brain like shift.
510280	514280	Yeah whatever you were just talking about has a chance to like click.
514280	515280	You said epiphany.
515280	516280	Yeah.
516280	517280	OK.
517280	518280	I didn't coin it.
518280	521280	I don't think I'm writing it down.
521280	525280	But but my epiphany was holy shit.
525280	526280	Nobody.
526280	529280	Everyone everyone in the world is a moron.
529280	544280	And so when the Internet gave them the ability to say things to each other a lot of these people inherited for the first time in their life the ability to say things to anyone in any way.
544280	554280	And so like these are not people who would be at your party and then say that while you were saying what you're saying.
554280	559280	Like I just tweet even when I'm like in a tweet storm.
559280	562280	I'm just doing what I do ask anybody that knows me.
562280	570280	I just talk and I don't fucking stop and I yell at everybody and I'm like there's another thought about Lena Dunham's dog.
570280	579280	But but then then I look at my replies and I think like oh this is these are all the things that people would say while I was doing that.
579280	582280	It's like you should be mad right away if they were going to.
582280	583280	They're not.
583280	585280	You're just reading their dumb little minds.
585280	587280	That's what you're talking to someone on the Internet.
587280	590280	That's what's happening is we have very low grade telepathy.
590280	594280	You're just seeing what's going on in their little lobster brain.
594280	599280	Like it's just like now they have the ability to like accidentally project it.
599280	600280	They're typing it.
600280	604280	And so you know and they're like I'm racist.
604280	611280	And you're like well what if you heard that as a voiceover from a guy next to you in a subway.
611280	612280	Would you.
612280	613280	You know it's like you.
613280	616280	It's still important to know that they're racist.
616280	617280	That's valuable information.
617280	620280	But I wouldn't get as mad at them.
620280	622280	I'd like turn and go like huh.
622280	623280	Nice.
623280	625280	And they'd be like what.
625280	626280	I'm racist.
626280	629280	And he'd be like I can't fool me.
629280	632280	And I'd feel like empowered and feel like a superhero.
632280	634280	Therefore I wouldn't get that mad at them.
634280	635280	I had this idea.
635280	650280	I had this idea like an evil plan like if I was an evil villain that like you could take all the stupid things that people say online that in the 1940s just wouldn't be you know online and able to be searchable by a robot.
650280	663280	And you get all this racist stuff and I don't know how you flag it but you flag it as dumb racist stuff and you collect it all and then use the bot to find these people's kids when they're like 13 or 11 or 12.
663280	672280	And you just show them all this racist stuff that their parents said and all this stupid shit and looks like here's your fucking parents they're fucking dipshits don't listen to anything they say.
672280	685280	And it'll be like a time bomb that just goes off simultaneously like 20 years in the future and it'll be an entire generation of like kids they're like wow my parents are really fucking stupid and we I just didn't see their Twitter feed all this time.
685280	688280	The society will break down.
688280	694280	I'm like I'm charmed by the notion that people don't know their parents are full of shit.
694280	699280	No but you just see all four years old. It'll be great. I mean it would be like I mean I don't want to.
699280	709280	But more importantly like like also you yourself right like just anything like oh yeah here's all the shit that you said when you were activated and like thought you were fighting something.
709280	714280	Yeah if my kids saw that I'd be like well I can't send him to his room.
714280	731280	That's the thing is that you're going to raise a generation of Pippi Longstocking it's like they're going to have no parents because yeah it'll be great but they'll be a little sad they'll be a little sad because the bots going to say here's your parents everything they say is full of shit and the kids going to say they just said happy birthday.
731280	735280	Just you know rattle the nest figure out what happened.
735280	746280	It's just the orphan maker five thousand right just floating through neighborhoods peeking in windows going love insincere insincerity proven.
746280	754280	What was the source of Pippi Longstocking super strength like why did why was she found that her mom was racist.
754280	759280	She found out her mom was racist. It was her spinach.
759280	772280	She would pull up her mom's Facebook if anybody was in trouble and she would read like what is what is this rant about Islam.
772280	779280	This is easily proven with a cursory Snopes visit.
779280	785280	Someone made a Snopes is fake news sound or did I project that onto them.
785280	792280	I think I can assume people that came on Game of Thrones night or what is that sound.
792280	799280	You know what else why else would you make that sound after I said a cursory Snopes visit.
799280	803280	Like what are they. They feel the same way you do. They hear the word Snopes.
803280	807280	Oh they were kind of like breathing out. They're going like that was fun Dan.
807280	811280	Thanks for sharing all that. I know they feel singled out.
811280	815280	It also might have been what's the Pippi Longstocking.
815280	820280	Yeah. What is half of what he says. It's just grandpa gibberish.
820280	827280	Well let's bring up younger blood. I'm just a big fan of this person.
827280	829280	I really don't know that much about her.
829280	833280	So I thought you know get to know her where I get to know everyone else.
833280	837280	She's out there in Brooklyn tweeting away.
837280	843280	She has like this amazing kind of like outlook.
843280	854280	I mean I've told you up here like you know where I'm at which is like starting at zero because I felt like I was like you heard me.
854280	863280	You can rewind my fucking stuff and you can hear me talking about things that are true which is that the bipartisan system doesn't work.
863280	866280	But now we all miss it very much. I do. I'll speak for myself.
866280	873280	And I'm like I'm like I'm like like I just kind of like I got I got what what what's that sound.
873280	876280	Why are you making that sound. It was laughter. Somebody laughed.
876280	883280	It's at the wrong time and it's the wrong kind.
883280	888280	I am vulnerable. Somebody was enjoying enjoying the show.
888280	892280	That's what I'm talking about. That's what happened to me after the election.
892280	897280	I started experiencing vulnerability. His name is Charlie Snopes.
897280	905280	I don't care. Oh oh oh Mr. Snopes from the New Hampshire Snopes.
905280	908280	Actually that's not true. We're not from New Hampshire.
908280	914280	Ah those Snopes. Would you like some dip. That's not dip.
914280	919280	OK. Getting annoying. Don't invite the Snopes over.
919280	923280	OK. Look this is a I stalked her Facebook page when she was hit.
923280	926280	She was flying in today and I was like I don't really know where we heard the Facebook page.
926280	931280	And I saw you know you can actually see things that are longer than on Twitter and stuff.
931280	937280	This is from December 1st is shortly after.
937280	942280	Throughout the campaign and election I felt that something was truly off about our institutions.
942280	947280	The way people were absorbing and discussing politics and the lack of discussion about policy.
947280	952280	I thought for a while about the source of this problem and potential solutions and I made a decision.
952280	956280	I'm working on a project to develop the concept of citizenship.
956280	959280	It's more than just knowing facts about the system.
959280	964280	Though I saw somewhere that only 36 percent of Americans can name the three branches of government.
964280	973280	It's a series of habits that reinforce the ways a citizen absorbs information participates in our system and reacts to the decision of those in power.
973280	978280	Decisions of those in power. It is not partisan in nature any more than the Constitution itself.
978280	983280	It is about seeing politics at its core as identifying and solving problems at the moment.
983280	988280	Too many see politics as a battle of dueling ideologies or degrading horrors.
988280	996280	There's the concept of we are the people being in charge of our own government and destiny is without faith and with few advocates.
996280	1001280	I want to rebuild that faith. We are our government. We can make decisions about our lives.
1001280	1005280	We can take pride in accepting reality even when it doesn't match our ideology.
1005280	1008280	We can see how the media we consume biases our perceptions.
1008280	1011280	We can fight self-serving perceptions with evidence and empathy.
1011280	1021280	We can engage in identifying and solving problems bigger than our individual lives whether that is through government involvement or restraint.
1021280	1030280	We can get honesty from our politicians about their plans demanded dignity and respect for the power they hold via their offices and punish them with ouster when they fail to bring solutions.
1030280	1034280	And she goes on and on and I wanted to go on and on up here.
1034280	1038280	So let's bring to the stage Caitlin Byrd.
1038280	1053280	Hello.
1053280	1063280	I forgot the one thing I should have asked you backstage was oh wait am I supposed to use your real name or did I just like okay.
1063280	1065280	No we can edit that out very easily.
1065280	1071280	And okay because because because you're you're you're you're meaningful identity to me is Gotham girl.
1071280	1073280	What's the foot your Twitter handle.
1073280	1081280	Gotham girl blue Gotham girl blue where I say where you have like a thousand followers which I didn't do anything to earn four hundred.
1081280	1084280	I did I did things that explain why I have them.
1084280	1096280	But I just the things that you're doing in that corner of the Internet seem magnificent to me and I'm coming to you for this episode of the podcast.
1096280	1108280	Just want to get a little like clarity but also hear from the side because I guess what am I why am I explaining to you how I'm about to interview you.
1108280	1116280	It's good. I've never been interviewed before. So this is like it's good. I need like some prep. OK. All right. Well let's talk about what I really you do all these.
1116280	1130280	You do all these kind of like tutorials like if people go to your you have a you have a separate Twitter that's like citizen zero and zero blog I think is the name of the Twitter handle and you're admittedly like just starting that.
1130280	1141280	And you're you're not this isn't your wheelhouse that in particular like you're not like a web genius or whatever but you're hoping this can be kind of a project that people get interested in.
1141280	1150280	It's sort of but it's about the analysis and and of what it is. What does it mean to be an active citizen. What does it mean.
1150280	1158280	And so I guess the thing that I want to start with is because all of us are familiar with this aspect which is arguing online about politics.
1158280	1171280	How do we do that right. I guess to start I did like actually write a post because I'm a terrible person who writes blogs forever.
1171280	1177280	But the first thing I think to start with is always to have an idea of what you actually want to get out of the discussion.
1177280	1183280	Like if you go into a political discussion and your aim you don't know what you want it to look like when it's done.
1183280	1190280	You're going to end up in a flame war where you call somebody cunt because it's going to happen because you're because you're secretly like not.
1190280	1201280	That's what you actually are burnt up about. You can actually do yourself good and do the other people good by actually knowing that that's what you're thinking first of all right.
1201280	1216280	Like so let's do an example of how to. So if I'm just sitting over here stewing. So first of all how do I. If I'm mad I hate women like let's say I just hypothetically.
1216280	1226280	I hate women. I just heard about the Wonder Woman premiere or the Wonder Woman screening where you're not allowed to have men at the thing at the Alamo Drafthouse.
1226280	1238280	So I just I just read about that on Facebook and now I'm I'm real mad or maybe I'm not even acknowledging I'm mad. I'm bemused because people don't understand how illogical it is.
1238280	1247280	But like what what what should I be doing in my status update or like is that the first mistake is that people don't start discourse that way.
1247280	1258280	They don't be honest and say this is how I feel. I think first of all would be like what kind of topic do you actually want to cover because if you want to just talk talk about how you feel about something there's so much space for that.
1258280	1270280	There's a lot of it. But you know if you want to use social media as your therapy session which is totally cool just acknowledge that that's what you're doing because then people don't want to engage with you if you're like having those feels.
1270280	1287280	I feel like that's not a great way to start a political discussion. I think the easiest way like I don't know I was really upset about I think the thread that you noticed that got you to follow me was the one about Bernie Sanders.
1287280	1299280	And I started from this place where I was like wow I've got a lot of thoughts about Bernie Sanders but so many in my head. So maybe I should like put them out there and I started from this place of like I don't want to be confrontational.
1299280	1307280	I don't want this to be like oh my God I hate Bernie all of you can suck it. So I came from another place because I know that that was going to end badly.
1307280	1330280	Like OK let's talk about why people don't like Bernie Sanders. Let's talk about that first. Let's talk about why people might not be involved in his campaign or not feel like he insults them or feel they're distant from his concepts at least if I get that out then at least you know where I'm coming from when I say that I don't like him and I don't want him to be president of the United States.
1330280	1342280	If I don't it's not personal my dislike but it means that I have to be honest about where I'm coming from what's motivating me and be able to explain and defend it when somebody comes up to me.
1342280	1348280	So if you so a good place to start from if you just want to vent some stuff which is which is all of our rights to do.
1348280	1365280	Like it's probably best to just be like let you know the more honest the better although some of us are you know like you want to be funny about it and you want to like have a point of view and sometimes that involves sarcasm and sometimes that involves like like oh the next thing that's going to happen is this and there's not really an argument there.
1365280	1380280	But let's say you were honest enough to say here's why some people don't like the Bernie movement here's why some of us feel a little betrayed even as you feel betrayed and all this stuff and you say these things and you lay out your thoughts.
1380280	1385280	And then someone's that so now let's go to the next step which is you're being attacked.
1385280	1407280	You're someone is someone is going to talk down to you whatever you want to call it like like like but but you seem to have this ability online which was inspiring to me like you don't automatically assume like that this even though you even though you know because we were talking backstage and Cody said how many times does it end with a conversion of someone zero absolutely 100 percent zero ever.
1407280	1413280	But people are watching and we're performing on Twitter but anyways I'm answering your question for you.
1413280	1425280	Here comes the I'm going to I'm going to be like a dummy like a mannequin like I'm going to be like okay you just said all that stuff about Bernie.
1425280	1446280	Okay so then I respond to you and I say yeah well what what what makes you because because you started it with like this is why some people so I'm going to hit you there and I go what makes you think you speak for the people you think you're speaking for why do you think you're speaking for those people.
1446280	1455280	He lost the primary by four million votes so I'm pretty sure I'm speaking for a lot of people who didn't vote for him.
1455280	1465280	So then that person's going to get riled up now because you're going to like to that person's now riled up because now they're going to go.
1465280	1474280	Well the reason he lost the primary is because the primary was was was not a fair fight. She.
1474280	1480280	You can see in the leaked emails that she's conspiring against him.
1480280	1486280	The Democratic Party is villainous and unfair. I don't know how I fit that in 140 characters but I did.
1486280	1506280	So my response also in 140 characters is that Bernie basically lost the race around March 1st and you would need to show exactly explain to me exactly what the DNC did before March 1st that secured the fact that he would never get enough delegates to win the nomination.
1506280	1521280	If you can explain that to me I will gladly take your position. I will acknowledge it. I will say like I totally understand where you feel you're coming from but you got to show me the evidence of a problem that could not be solved by his campaign.
1521280	1548280	Do you ever have are you because I just like what this is going to fuse with maybe let's learn a little bit about your like from birth forward like your early story because I'm curious about how after that election and those spreadsheet results where certain demographics were revealed to be just as chaotic as life itself.
1548280	1575280	Things that we thought if you had this quality or that quality from birth that how and that that has put us all into a tizzy and there's actually on that spreadsheet as I said after the election if you cross all of it it's like there's one group of people that should be taking their hands off the wheel right now and and be more jaded than ever and that's black women because they turned out to the polls.
1575280	1585280	And like I don't know who those 3% were 2% or whatever it was but but it was like and did you look to go back to that first of all did you feel a betrayal.
1585280	1607280	The next morning from from your other Democrats from from from white people from from white women from from I mean you expected it from white men maybe but like was were you shocked like that women didn't like Wonder Woman it's through you know like like like just like as one gender.
1607280	1628280	I guess yeah no first of all I was kind of in a coma after the election results because I was with my best friend and we were hanging out and we were so excited and then like we started calling Florida and I was like oh this is this is not good isn't that good and my friend was like freaking out because she was I mean we're both black women.
1628280	1642280	She was freaking out she was like we're going to die we're going to die and I was like maybe not maybe maybe something will happen and then she'll win and then we won't die and it didn't work out like that fortunately most alive.
1642280	1660280	I kept yelling at Cody like like it's not he's not winning you know like I was like I was like mad at her for thinking it was possible for women to have their hearts broken like no it's not going to happen this you don't get the universe okay.
1661280	1675280	Yeah so I did feel to a certain degree I was like this wasn't supposed to happen the numbers weren't supposed to work like this I had I mean I grew up in local politics so I actually did my first door to door petition drive at three.
1676280	1681280	This will stop any minute now that's my car I think.
1682280	1684280	It was really mad about.
1689280	1692280	Take it well take us to the moment of birth if that's not too invasive.
1693280	1695280	How long was the labor.
1696280	1704280	What hospital no was it was it were you are we born and bred in New York. Yeah I was born and raised in New York. Both of my parents were like very civically minded.
1704280	1713280	My mom curses too much to be an elected official so she never really got into the like the negotiation of politics because she doesn't have patience can you do an impression of your mother.
1716280	1730280	By the way I'm from the future coming through a portal into your mother's kitchen about her political career. It's not because of your swearing it will only ever be because you're a woman like it's like we are going to elect a man who talks like a sewer.
1730280	1738280	And in all the ways that really matter you're and then I'm going to go back to the portal and enjoy a nice cocktail. Yeah no it's good.
1739280	1752280	And then my dad was was an actual local elected official he actually helped preserve a local train line that was going to get torn down and I got a chance to ride on it because he'd done all that work.
1752280	1762280	And it was really cool to kind of grow up in local politics except that knowing all your politicians local politicians means that you find them really human and really petty all the time.
1763280	1771280	But it was it was a good experience to like see what it looks like to do all the time like petition drives and try to get people involved and all that other stuff.
1771280	1790280	And then they after the election I was sitting there after having spent lots of hours yelling at my television about like that doesn't matter doesn't matter doesn't matter that he like loves golf like why does anyone care who is talking about these really important things like are we going to upgrade our energy grid.
1790280	1802280	That's really important we can't just let it sit there for the next 20 years deteriorating is anyone to talk about global warming is any like literally at all like just maybe like five minutes could you just ask him a question about climate change.
1803280	1811280	And then if he doesn't answer correctly because there's a correct answer there's only one answer actually there's literally he is no multiple choice it's like one answer.
1811280	1834280	A the earth is getting warmer be the next question would be what are we going to do and the answer is fix it that's that's like there are only two answers to those questions you were talking backstage about the original zero sum game which sounds exactly like that which is human rights because you take it you're telling me things about the Dixie Crats and history that I am just here to absorb.
1835280	1839280	So I was thinking about Soylent or something for those years.
1840280	1860280	So like human rights used to be a part of the Republican Party platform when they started like when the Republican Party started and defining human rights because now we live in this post nationalist like what do we meet American human rights or do we meet like any human rights when you're talking about slavery there's kind of like no like separation between American human rights just regular human rights.
1860280	1883280	They're the same they're the same concept and when you're talking about the ability to access your civil society like if that's the standard that you're setting for your citizenship like white dudes get to participate in society that's that's a human right at that point it's not like a right for a particular group if it's necessary to make it possible for that entire group to vote then it's necessary for everyone to be able to vote.
1883280	1891280	That's how it should work. The only reason we have an age cut off is because you have you met 17 year olds like no they're not allowed to do anything.
1891280	1901280	Yeah I don't I don't want to run by me at 32 or or five seconds ago we move forward and we grow and hopefully the yeah which society whatever why am I doing this.
1901280	1913280	The but the so a sidebar on that because I keep reading about voter suppression that I get gerrymandering I understand that a little bit.
1913280	1926280	That's simply the horrible kind of sometimes functional but ultimately erosive process of playing chess with like where districts are drawn so that but blah blah blah we all know gerrymandering isn't how that is voter suppression.
1926280	1940280	What is the what is the shit going on with like like why is it really as simple as like with voter ID laws talk about the state of affairs with voter ID laws is that different from state to state I'm lost there.
1940280	1951280	So every state gets to determine what it's going to do with its own election which is a good thing in some ways and bad thing from like a national perspective when we're voting for president because it's really annoying.
1951280	1963280	But state by state basically what you can do is you can create a standard for voting and once you do that you basically can control the rules of who what it means to get to participate in voting.
1963280	1968280	I know that there was an automatic voter registration bill that was going through in Nevada.
1968280	1971280	I believe there's a state or two that's working with on it.
1971280	1983280	It might be Oregon Oregon actually passed it which means that you're automatically registered at 18 and you have to like go and D register or something like that in order to stop being on the voter rolls or death certificate.
1983280	1997280	And that means that like voter suppression works this way which is basically if you set a standard right that only some people can meet even though everybody is an eligible voter then you get to choose who filters through.
1997280	2001280	And that's what they wanted. That's what voter suppression is about. They want to apply a drug test.
2001280	2007280	And how does how does an ID how does the idea of needing an ID.
2007280	2011280	What how does it talk about that filter is actual manifestation.
2011280	2018280	So the first thing is is that they use the fact that only some forms of ID are legitimate ID.
2018280	2022280	Your college ID is not a legitimate form of ID even has your address on it.
2022280	2031280	So that means college students now have to get a separate ID in the state with all their birth information rather than just being able to use a student ID to vote.
2031280	2035280	So you can register at school at college and vote.
2035280	2044280	Actually again my bestie went to was in school in Philadelphia and she voted out Rick Santorum and that was like one of her great like she's always like I can die now.
2044280	2048280	Having done that I voted out Rick Santorum that feels so good.
2048280	2058280	And she was able she didn't need to present like photo ID she was able to go present the evidence that she lived in Philadelphia as her means of doing it.
2058280	2067280	Right now what happens is that with voter ID laws basically what they do is they set a standard that you have to meet so you have to bring your birth certificate or this.
2067280	2074280	Like how many people right now in this room can tell you like tell say specifically where your birth certificate is right at this moment.
2074280	2075280	Not me anybody.
2075280	2081280	How many people say everybody who did not raise their hand you can't vote.
2081280	2087280	Yeah I mean I'm just adding any it just occurred to me adding any hoops.
2088280	2106280	Even if they're seemingly not like they're not like hey if you are a fan of the Patriots you need to it's like the filter only needs to be a filter in order to slow down poor people young people people that are working a lot.
2106280	2120280	It's like any extra steps the harder you make it to vote the more I think I think that's essentially well it occurs to me we're down a fucking branch that I took you down because OK voting is a human right.
2120280	2129280	That is a that's an argument that we're still having needlessly the idea that voting is a human right.
2129280	2147280	Forget about shelter medicine all these things so take us back to somewhere around the 1800s about and let's step forward where human rights is like this issue that starts fragmenting us into weird bedfellows.
2147280	2156280	I mean it's always been fragmenting us so let's start from the basic sentence the basic concept rate the idea of America is that it's not based off of where you came nationally.
2156280	2169280	You know it's always the dream it's the mythology that we talk about on July 4th is that we built a country on ideals and you could come here and you could dream what you wanted to dream you know dream the impossible dream all of that I can't sing so I'm not gonna try it.
2169280	2190280	But the point is is that you can there's this notion that we were built differently and there when we had explicitly human rights as part of our declaration you know they talk about tyranny and bloodshed and controlling us and we deserve the right we are endowed by our creator.
2190280	2211280	Whoever that is and like come on they said it right up there we're endowed with our creator with certain inalienable rights and among these is the right you know all those happy rights that they talk about and that you come out of a womb or even ostensibly that Constitution holds up to us being test tube babies sorry to cut you off when I saw a sci-fi angle here.
2211280	2232280	You're coming into this world one way or the other but the Constitution is this document like they sat down and they said let's form this labor union of a country this hotel lobby of a country that says no matter what happens no matter what anyone would try to use as an excuse that the idea is that everyone in this country you call you as soon as you draw your first waking breath.
2233280	2260280	You are actually you have these rights they're not given to you I know I sound like a sixth grade teacher but I was just like we have we have forgotten that in our bones right like and when well early on so continue yes so except for slaves like the rule was like everybody I mean everybody who's a white dude has a neoliberal rights but I don't know about the rest of you like maybe white women I don't I don't know we're working it out.
2260280	2287280	Well we're kind of masters of the unspoken exception like we didn't but if we had to write it goes back to that thing of if you had to declare like if you were passionate at the framing the Constitution you would have to read it and go like black people let's let's write about them for a while and you'd have to do it but you don't have to do that when you're you can just say all people are created equal and I'll find out what I mean by that later but for now I mean Phil and his cousin Tony.
2288280	2295280	Anyways sorry it's these negative spaces that we're now like coming to bear out and that's why there's amendments and that's really because we didn't.
2296280	2312280	By the way we fucking mean this go please so then leaving people out of that discussion of human rights eventually fractured the country and to because one group was like not they definitely don't have human rights and the other group was like I'm maybe they do it.
2312280	2341280	I just a little bit just like maybe a handful of human rights are not equal to us but they seem to be human we I think actually actually after quite a lot of time they do appear to be human beings so we might need to just accept them as part of the country and they're like whoa you can't do that and then they decide to murder each other over it for about four years and the Republican Party's concept was like we actually recognize that slavery is bad because it infringes upon human rights.
2342280	2363280	And they held up that end of the bargain until basically shortly after the basically until 64 1964 Republicans who held on pretty well and the only thing that cracks the black vote away from them was the New Deal policies because they were like wow you screwed up real bad like we have no money.
2363280	2391280	We might not be able to vote for you again actually this guy my FDR might have some solutions for us and we're okay with with splitting away from you and you saw the black vote start to diverge and split into two pieces but the reason it didn't go fully democratic under FDR was because they had the Dixiecrat coalition the same people at the founding were like no no we got to keep slaves and the same people in 1865 who were like no no no no we have to kill Lincoln and continue trying to impose slavery.
2391280	2407280	And the people who terrorized black people in the years between Jim Crow those people were the same people who've been arguing this entire time like no human rights are not actually fundamental to this republic they're not there only for some people and we're seeing that play out now.
2407280	2436280	These words that up to six months ago are just grown up words to me and continued about I don't care about fucking Medicaid health care all this shit these words they sound they sound they're more boring than a than a Central American countries presidents last name like I'm like this doesn't have anything to do with me Medicaid Medicare all this stuff but it's like then you like you peel back the layers and you're like Jesus fucking Christ you just think that cancer is punishing you.
2436280	2459280	Cancer is punishable by more death if you're poor than if you're rich which is fucking insane if you wrote it in the crawl of a sci fi movie and said the people are divided by between people that think that if you have a random thing happen to you while you are on American soil and American citizen if you have if you have sickness which is just a part of life.
2459280	2488280	We believe that then you're your life should just be shortened by your poverty and no one is having that I mean now everyone's having that conversation but we're still not just watching watching Paul Ryan struggle through that PowerPoint that he made with like crayons where he's like he thought he was going to blow our minds I think because his mind had just recently been blown he was like let me break this down like I don't know if you guys get it but.
2489280	2508280	Basically what people are suggesting is that look at all these sick people did you know what happens when you get sick you can't make money so they're this they're like the poorest people in the world and the sickest this is a problem that solves itself.
2509280	2529280	That's what he was yelling at us and everyone was like what the fuck don't you understand about every step of society that all of us have ever learned since our mommy sat us down and said your roommate needs the rent check I'll bail you out this time but get your shit together or you have to move back home and I make fun of you.
2530280	2548280	Like like every every every college kid gets it everywhere but how do you I don't know what my question is but I just like I mean like like so where do you stand this is an interesting segue into this so so I'm getting the impression then that you're probably not one to.
2549280	2569280	Where are you in all this like this this this this treason Russia like like soap opera I'm guessing your answer is to the extent that it's there's evidence and and rule of law let's proceed forward but let's not let it distract us from the occasional lobbying pushed forward or.
2570280	2574280	It's the most important thing that's ever happened in American democracy I knew it.
2574280	2601280	Because because a hostile foreign actor totally went into our most sacred institution and fucked it all up is that am I allowed to say that oh yeah yeah yeah because I mean nothing we're like if you want to talk listen there's like the metaphor right of the body politic and people use that all the time like imagine voting is being your your spine.
2601280	2630280	Like someone just went in and fucked with your spine you wouldn't be like we're cool we'll just chill like you'd be like no that really fucked up people are distracted my perception is that people are distracted first and foremost by there's like this this victory parade they're having which is not happy at all which is called we one get over it and the and that they perceive that they don't even get to start going down the block before people are like pouring weird they think that people are cheating.
2631280	2642280	By going like Russia Russia Russia and they I think that the biggest thing that they don't understand the people that are still bothering to like go where come on get over it where's the evidence I'm tired of hearing this.
2643280	2658280	Is that they think that at the end of this whole process Hillary Clinton gets to become president because they cheated like you know like that we're going to find out that she should put the hood on a voting machine and like put extra votes in there.
2658280	2672280	But but here's the thing about that is that like if you were to cheat in like a local election and they found out they would just nullify the election your opponent would win that's that's how it works that's not there's no like complicated thing there.
2672280	2695280	But it depends on your job but my impression is that what we're debating with them because it seems like to the extent maybe Spencer you can jump in or you've yeah you have a beard but it's it's it seems like we've long since kind of dropped like maybe we'll find out more but right now we're sort of like not worried about the results of the election we saw them.
2695280	2714280	They they bummed us out and were surprising but at the same time like it's fine and is the result of this constant effort on the part of a foreign hostile former superpower the most dangerous psychological post internet fucking threat you could have.
2715280	2732280	That what we've learned about Russia is that that's how they handle their satellite states and that's how they like they've just been like they have troll farms and all that shit is real and that that doesn't mean that if we prove collusion someone else gets to be president except for the fact that you can't be president from prison.
2733280	2750280	But but it they I think they're I think the people that are still hanging on are really like even dumber than me about politics and are thinking stop trying to act like this elections not going to stick and I'm like it's stuck now he goes to prison.
2751280	2758280	What happened I mean prison that's really hard to do impeachment yeah it's it's really hard we've never put a president in prison.
2758280	2767280	Another thing is is that I like to think about this like it's kind of scary don't don't freak out everybody but like we're kind of in the place right now that we were before the Civil War.
2768280	2785280	We're like there's no real chance like the only thing that fix the Civil War was the 13th 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution like there was never any like hey I don't know can we just sit down and talk about whether or not it's okay to leave the United States over slavery can we just have to sit down have a conference and we'll talk it out.
2785280	2797280	Like we need to build a process and it's going to be like the craziest thing we've ever done is to build a process to deal with the reality that an election was stolen at this level and if we don't figure that process out.
2798280	2799280	What did I say to you.
2799280	2815280	What did I say to you. During the opening monologue. I'm sorry I like him. He's so passionate. Sorry. Why did we why did I operate in tandem with this guy.
2816280	2827280	To derail you like we're like you're a writer your blogger you're an activist like how how are you going to help save the world like we got you got to help us and like what's the next steps that we have to do.
2828280	2837280	Because by the way in case you can't tell my solution is fly her out let her talk and then I'll just worship her vote for you then my problems are solved. Anything can I get back to Mario Kart.
2838280	2849280	Like like like like that's that that is what you're what everyone's dealing with is both inside them and with any people that they choose to talk to is like man we all like it was working like.
2850280	2858280	I wake up every day I think like a lot of people do with with this kind of dopamine drip of oh we got him Donald Trump Jr is doing this thing.
2859280	2865280	We did it like they're all going to jail. They're not fucking going to jail for not going away.
2866280	2885280	It took six years for Nixon. He won two elections by a landslide and then had to find his own shame at the end of that story still and that that cascaded from your grandma and uncle and people at Thanksgiving not having Facebook to bolster them every morning with more and fed a minute fucking rage.
2886280	2892280	But in fact for they had to come around it. I think Nixon's a dick. I'm sick of it. Sorry I told you you're a lesbian.
2892280	2904280	That's a hard line to take. Nixon's a dick. You know he's tricky too. I wish there was shorthand for any of this but honey there's no Facebook yet. I've got a I've got three pigs to slaughter before lunch.
2905280	2920280	I leave town every couple of weeks and I turn off the news and I don't read a paper and I come back assuming that Donald Trump has killed a kindergarten because it seems like he will one day and they're always in trouble.
2920280	2933280	There's always some bullshit in the news cycle and then nothing happens and we all think it's going to be fixed but it's not going to be fixed. We actually have to revolt at some point. We have to take it to the streets.
2934280	2941280	Well let's get back to this amendment. Let's make three new amendments. Do you think it's called the Doobie amendment called taking it to the streets.
2941280	2952280	Are you suggesting that maybe we take our lumps with Trump and let this cancer ride out knowing that we are bombarding it with the chemo of fucking holy shit what the fuck have we done that's going to make us sick bum us out.
2952280	2981280	But that if that stops the cancer of fascism that the thing we need to do is beat this metaphor dead take on the dietary and environmental changes of. Are you talking about election protection amendments like things that actually federalize and centralize the election process and make it hack proof because I felt like the hacking was cultural in this case.
2982280	2996280	It was like Russia taking advantage of the fact that we're all like. So what were you. What do you think. What do we need to change if he's not if you're not thinking about impeachment or arrest.
2997280	3010280	I'm definitely thinking about both impeachment and arrest but we've never had a significant portion of our line of succession all removed simultaneously. And of course if let's be honest if he stole an election he's not legitimately president.
3010280	3032280	If he stole an election Mike Pence is not legitimately vice president. We don't have any idea what's going on with Paul Ryan but I strongly believe that he probably had some idea since he used to hack DCC D triple C emails against House candidates which means that he either didn't know he was using stolen information from Russia or he knew and just didn't care.
3033280	3035280	I think Paul Ryan stole our hearts.
3038280	3042280	He's dreaming that lizard that lizard face.
3042280	3071280	But okay so yeah because that's what we're all thinking right now like we we wake up that that fucking meeting where and somebody somebody made the reference before I did I thought I'd be the oldest person on Twitter and go yeah Serrano's got the disks which is a reference to midnight run in which the resolution is all Robert De Niro has to do is to get crime boss Tony Serrano.
3072280	3101280	And I hope to accept discs that it's been established Serrano believes are fruit of the of the hacked election like like you know like like like yes I like a Russian government lawyer and it's amazing that they I did actually it's not amazing that they identify themselves that way right because what these the Russians probably are like going when you're Russia everything you do is a win win win win win there is not even one lose in there there's no wrong move for Russia
3101280	3130280	they can just email you and go hey we've got naked pictures of Hillary Clinton hey I've got naked pictures of your mother too I've got naked they can just send out whatever they want any meeting you take now they've got you for that they get they can just and then the further the relationship deepens the more stoked they get the longer they wait the more they offer up and you have to figure that combined with the collective IQ of the Trump team who never thought they were going to win.
3131280	3153280	Like they've got to be in so fucking deep it's insane so then we all wake up realizing this we're all starting to realize this that this treasonous path probably very likely Occam's razor says these motherfuckers like before they before they knew it was even possible to commit treason when all you want to do is just win the presidency.
3153280	3182280	They committed treason so long ago we're going to find it out and then you just like wait what we're all just sitting here going then what do we do yeah there's there's actually no actual process for that or answer I kind of wish I could give one the answer I think we talked backstage it was about you know know what you want to see right so what do we want to see like like imagine like imagine right now like the president of the United States has not been a legitimately elected none of his cabinet can take over for him.
3183280	3204280	Not his vice president either we have no system whatsoever has ever had this happen so what do you what happened what do we as citizens want to see because if you can't figure out that next step which is like do we will rerun the election we could we have the money it's not like we can't afford to run a second election and the problem is Republicans have to put somebody new up you should we give them the opportunity.
3204280	3216280	You know should we just claim that it's illegitimate have install Hillary that's going to go well people will be very calm.
3216280	3233280	You know so the problem is that you need to know what you want to achieve first and then the answer is to start working backwards so what what can we do as citizens to make it easier to understand what that result should look like and I honestly believe that we should declare declare the election illegitimate
3233280	3246280	and Hillary Clinton should be president of the United States and I don't just say that because I really liked voting for her but also because I mean in all honesty that's what happens with virtually every other contest that we've ever run where we find somebody cheated.
3246280	3258280	Every other time in all of the history of the world when we're like hey um turns out you you're a fucking cheater you actually totally stole that thing you don't get your medals you don't get to win the game.
3258280	3268280	You're erased from the history books we remove things like that's just how it's always gone it happens in local elections when am I allowed to make fun of Barrett.
3268280	3279280	Yeah what year what age does he have to be before we can go statue on that you are clearly because I've got so many tweets just backlogged.
3279280	3287280	Oh my god I can't talk about it like like like many of the things that I want to see are felonies to say out loud into a microphone.
3287280	3290280	I've researched it.
3290280	3296280	The one of the mayor may not be like I just can't I was Barron's adulthood in general.
3296280	3306280	I can't wait until he's walking around. I am endlessly entertained by Donald Trump Jr. I think because I just like he.
3306280	3335280	It's like I his tweets like and with his avatar with that hair and his face like I just regress to a time in my in every cell in my body when I was absolutely the underdog I didn't know that I would find out 40 years later that you know that my view of things is limited to where I turn my head but when all when I knew I had righteous anger when I knew who the bad guys were.
3335280	3344280	And why I was a hero hit that fucking kid and I'm calling him a kid because his dad calls him a kid which is part of the problem he's my age.
3344280	3360280	He's a fucking he is such a villain he's always been a villain and I love that he's entered the fucking forefront of everything it makes me so happy now I'm rooting for I'm rooting for evil to have happened I'm rooting for him to disappoint his father.
3360280	3368280	I want I want I want I want one of the two of them mythically this for federal officers listening.
3368280	3389280	I just I just I just I just I want the whole thing to end in all of them in a reservoir dogs crossbow fight crossbow where where a secret service like commander whatever their highest ranking official is like has been locked out of the room like a firewall like in the like in that life movie.
3389280	3404280	With with Jay gills they they're on the space station and the octopus monster starts firewalls and they're like locked out of the Oval Office like we need to be in there and then they come in and it's like people are talking about what happened with flow charts for six years.
3404280	3414280	Because all you see is just they they all did it to themselves they're just like there's just crossbow bolts everywhere and freedom.
3415280	3422280	A vacuum of freedom and then from then on the Oval Office is like this weird place where like well we couldn't tear it down.
3422280	3426280	Here's where the tour gets even more interesting than it used to be.
3426280	3432280	It was already the thing you were looking forward to now it's also got a lot of ghost story.
3432280	3443280	I just think that we don't need them to have crossbows we just need to make it like hemophilia like the Romanovs like they should all just die of some sort of weird I don't want to wait those that many generations.
3443280	3446280	Did you just fart or was that your chair.
3446280	3451280	Okay I thought I thought I thought I was like Dan when I fart you'll fucking know it.
3451280	3455280	That's what I thought that's why I thought was happening I thought you farted and I knew it.
3455280	3458280	The one who heard it.
3458280	3461280	Caitlin turd it.
3462280	3482280	So what about you personally as a person like because part of what's inspiring about you is you have that I don't want to be your Joan of Arc stop treating me like something that's going to solve all your problems vibe which makes me want to treat you like that.
3482280	3486280	Just tell me what to do and tell me what to think and I'll vote for you. Do you have political aspirations.
3486280	3495280	Do you want to know I don't you will never see my name on a ballot like not ever not not good not good over there.
3495280	3513280	So what is it but does that to say that like there's sideways like your citizen zero blog like we can we don't why yeah why be a politician if we are the people like yeah well first things first is that I am not polite enough to be in like that like I have a really high standard for elected officials.
3513280	3525280	And especially when you grow up with them you see like a lot of their foibles and but also a lot of I'm going to be really nice to my local politicians a lot of kindness a lot of patience.
3525280	3532280	There are people are going to ask you some of the stupidest shit you've ever heard in your life and you're going to have to be like yes I understand your issue.
3532280	3539280	It is really terrible that the lines are that particular shade of yellow in in the two lines are that's it's so tough.
3539280	3545280	I understand. We will I will definitely take that up at the next council meeting. I will absolutely do it.
3545280	3554280	They walk off and you're like what's that. You know when you just do that to your to your local people and you're just looking at them like your staff and like did that really just happen.
3554280	3562280	Did someone just come to yell at me about the shade of yellow on on our streets. OK cool. I just want to know that happened and then you go back to doing like real hard work.
3562280	3569280	And I don't have any patience for that. I would just be that person like are you. Did you come to me with that. That's what you. That's my time.
3569280	3574280	I only have so much time alive and you chose to spend five minutes talking to me about that. That's not OK.
3574280	3582280	And there are people that would enjoy that job and would feel overpaid in the standard salary. And correct me if you think I'm wrong.
3582280	3590280	But like it seems to me that our class of politicians from top to bottom has become an inversion of that demographic.
3590280	3597280	Like we all went to high school with people that we remember and go like you know that person should have been an alderman.
3597280	3607280	That person should have been president like I because actually they would enjoy civil service. They would enjoy like the drudgery of it.
3607280	3618280	They like to be fair. They don't blow their stack when they talk to idiots. And those people are 180 degrees like on a different road.
3618280	3628280	They're directed that way by I don't want to say Hydra but I don't want to get into a conspiracy theory like a reptilian like alien that's taken over our earth.
3628280	3641280	But there's definitely there's a problem there and it also it all comes back to the individual's definition of what it means to be an American citizen which we have been especially recently but probably for my entire life.
3641280	3660280	We we feel like we got born here and then there's this immigration thing and the whole like melting pot thing and we learned that in high school and schoolhouse rock videos and the idea of gaining citizenship and that meaning like you just have like a card that says you can participate.
3660280	3671280	But like what it actually means to be the citizen of a democratic republic. And so I don't want to put you on the spot as much as I want to gain some clarity in my life.
3671280	3683280	What do I do differently. We've had we have people up here and I ask all the time. So what do I do. We've all. So we've all heard you got to call your so and so you got to do this and that.
3683280	3702280	I don't. Yes it should be. It should be working. We should want to figure it out. But is there is there a way to like get a better map of it like how much of my day is given over to being a citizen if I'm an active participant in that role.
3702280	3714280	Well I would say well first thing that I want to say is that I'm hoping to build a system. If you guys go to citizen zero project dot org or dot com I've owned both.
3714280	3721280	It's all it's just good. It's good for a brand. So if you go there I actually have a project that I'm working on.
3721280	3735280	It would be which would be an online web portal. I really want to build this where basically people could log in and find out like all the things that their elected officials have been doing and you get updates like every week every two weeks or every month depending on when you wanted to see it.
3735280	3746280	And you'd be able to like build a report card so it would like summarize a lot of the stuff that you do and don't agree with your elected officials about that way you wouldn't actually have to do all that legwork by yourself because that sucks.
3746280	3752280	Like it really does and I do it and I spend way too much time doing it and it's really exhausting.
3752280	3762280	On the basic citizenship scale and like the national scale I should say that you should probably be on top of at least you should have like one issue you really care about at least one.
3762280	3769280	It doesn't have to be like very fancy or anything like that. You just be like wow those stagnant pools of water totally going to attract mosquitoes. It's gross.
3769280	3774280	If you're aware of something that like that in your neighborhood I know it's really small and stupid but like that's a thing.
3774280	3777280	We care about that thing and then.
3777280	3783280	But what if you want to be a nice person so I say I have a stagnant pool of mosquitoes in my I see it's two blocks away.
3783280	3790280	Now I'm going to definitely the person in me that's both nice and that wants to just get back to Mario Kart.
3790280	3805280	That's a dangerous combination of agreement because both of them say don't because you're going to call a congressperson about stagnant pools of mosquitoes and you're going to be an idiot and you're someone's going to answer that you're going to feel dumb and disempowered all day.
3805280	3808280	You're going to get on a phone tree and all this stuff.
3808280	3811280	There's a first step there that's like I don't know who to call.
3811280	3815280	I don't. Is it to an alderman an ombudsman.
3815280	3818280	It would come from.
3818280	3821280	Is there like I.
3821280	3824280	That's why I said I don't want to put you on the spot because I don't want to make it.
3824280	3833280	I want to make humanities tendency to be a robotic coward your fault and problem to solve.
3833280	3844280	But the closer we could get to like actually here's how you do a layup or whatever so that if you want to expand on it and make your own style.
3844280	3847280	That's great but I've only speaking for myself.
3847280	3851280	That's how I feel about it is being in gym class and the coach says it's great.
3851280	3852280	It's a layup.
3852280	3854280	It's like the most common thing in basketball.
3854280	3859280	You just do this and do that and then you go like that and I'm like I can't I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
3859280	3868280	Slow down what foot goes where first put cutouts on the floor if you really care about me ever caring about this sport.
3868280	3876280	You'll like come in my bedroom window the way video games do and say just push this button and like I do.
3876280	3884280	But do we say stop catering to that and fuck you if you can't be a man.
3884280	3889280	I would say that the easiest thing to do is just find as I said find an issue.
3889280	3895280	A lot of it's easy when it's a mosquito water mosquito water or you can choose something at a national level.
3895280	3897280	Climate change is a big one.
3897280	3898280	Net neutrality.
3898280	3899280	Net neutrality.
3899280	3907280	So I know I call my congressperson and I go hi my name is so and so I but you know I'm concerned about net neutrality.
3907280	3912280	Don't start with the call to your congressperson unless you know what you're going to say before you pick up the phone.
3912280	3918280	In all honesty that's why you feel disempowered all day is because you started out and you're like I feel really strongly.
3918280	3922280	And you get on the phone with a representative like a person they're like so why.
3922280	3925280	And you're like because feelings.
3925280	3930280	I have so many feelings because I watched John Oliver last night because I watched on Oliver.
3930280	3933280	Well God I mean if you watch John Oliver then you kind of know what to say.
3933280	3935280	What about the people.
3935280	3947280	What about the people that don't that feel like look I'm I'm doing this like I there's got to be people who are more scared than I am of getting on the phone and having.
3947280	3951280	Who answers and what do you like.
3951280	3961280	Like you say like know what you want but you grew up around politics like it's possible you see more of the fishbowl than I do.
3961280	3973280	Again I would actually start like much smaller which is instead of trying to make the action go outside of yourself just figure out like literally spend some time I would say like an hour a week maybe an hour or two.
3973280	3979280	Just sitting around and being like OK what is about this issue like who's talked about it who's an expert in this issue that I care about.
3979280	3985280	You care about net neutrality you should be reading up on as much stuff about where it comes from what the term means.
3985280	3990280	You should at least know the basics of that term and it really just takes like that's just like an hour a week.
3990280	4001280	That's just and then when you're ready you can take a whole month if you want to a whole four hours and then once you've looked at something for four hours and you can say like do I want to call my congressman over this.
4001280	4013280	Like first of all you'll learn just by checking up on that issue for four hours like OK this is who's responsible like you'll learn like OK we need to talk to federal people because you'll see in their research you'll be like whoa.
4013280	4022280	This is a federal issue it's definitely not something for my state legislator then you might check on something like climate change and find out well we're in California it's going to be your state.
4022280	4034280	All right well let's do an exercise I'll be I'm going to be this and the fun thing about this is you can't do wrong because I'm live I'm a manifestation of my own fear in this exercise.
4034280	4041280	I'm the person on the other end of the phone you be you you're a citizen you're activated about an issue you don't even have to tell me what it is.
4041280	4048280	I'm answering the phone at the House of Representatives level for your district.
4048280	4063280	All right. Are you going to make this ringing sound effect or should I. Oh you should definitely do the ring. OK.
4063280	4072280	Good afternoon congressmen she's spanned him in his office. Hi I'm Caitlin I'm really interested in our roads and bridges.
4072280	4081280	OK do you have an appointment to speak. An appointment to speak. Yeah. The United States I don't need to speak to my. Yeah.
4081280	4089280	Normal speaking hours are from three to five every Tuesday except Wednesday except every third of the fourth is Tuesday or Thursday.
4089280	4102280	I would say that my first amendment right is open any time. OK. First amendment meeting is. OK bye. Thanks for calling.
4102280	4111280	So that doesn't happen right. That's my fear. That is for my first fear. This is a healthy exercise like that doesn't happen.
4111280	4122280	It doesn't happen because it happens when I need my teeth fixed and it happens like I don't know or maybe it just only happens in my fucking head.
4122280	4127280	Like when I need my driver's license renewed but that OK just that doesn't happen. No it does not happen.
4127280	4137280	You don't need to worry about your congressman's office blowing you off. That's in general when they are just curious on the phone they find out that that person was actually really important.
4137280	4147280	Now they've got like a donor who's going to be like hey I am my my my sister called up and you treat her horrible. And then as a sudden it's like oh I just lost million dollars. Thank you.
4147280	4156280	Right. That's what happens actually. Now can you can you can you guys reverse roles and Dan you call her up. Oh yeah. Well you show us to take us at least that far and then we can move forward from there.
4156280	4165280	So I'll do what you did. I think I but I'll probably offend you but I'm trying. I do. I do. I get it. That means you have to do the ring sound. OK.
4165280	4182280	But you get some. Yeah. OK. Bring. Oh I should already be on the phone. You called her. Hi. This is the congressman's office. How can I help you. Yes I'm very concerned.
4183280	4195280	Hold on a second. I forgot what I was concerned about. You're not. I forgot what you were concerned about. Were you concerned about net neutrality. I was concerned about roads and bridges. Oh roads and bridges. OK. Sorry.
4195280	4209280	I forgot. Hi. This is. Hi. I'm concerned about roads and bridges. OK. That's great. What specific road or bridge were you worried about.
4209280	4238280	I mean we take our federal bridges and stuff. Well I think. Well all I know is. All I know is that I drive over the third street bridge every day and it seems to be getting worse and worse. I've been taking that route for 30 years and I keep reading these things in the paper about you know funding and stuff and I just feel like there's so many potholes and it feels like a bridge.
4238280	4254280	But I just like like and I see other things about infrastructure and other parts of the country. I don't want to be one of those cities where people don't say hey I want my bridge traversable. So I called. Yeah we don't we don't want a situation like Minnesota because we're so much better than that.
4254280	4282280	Yeah fuck those fucking pieces of shit. So let me. I can't believe you knew you just could tell from my voice that I would I would I would bite on the anti Minnesotan. Yeah I totally did. And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take down your concern. I'm going to route it to the appropriate offices. I'm going to talk to our legislative aid on infrastructure. OK. But is this like the run around. What are you doing to me here.
4282280	4311280	This is I don't know what this is me. Can I call back later and every time I have a bridge concern if I call back every day like do I have to change my voice to be taken seriously or or if I'm if I continue to be concerned about the bridge every time you answer the phone will you eventually file a restraining order against me. I don't believe that members of Congress can file restraining orders against. Are you a member of Congress. Well not me. Are you going to call me every day.
4311280	4340280	Aren't you going to be working there for a while. I mean like we rotate like it's not just me on the phone. What's your name. Hang out with me specifically. Sorry what's your name. Sandy Sandy I'm Dan. I'm Caitlin. I'm Caitlin. Sorry. I live in Brooklyn by the 3rd Street Bridge. OK cool. I don't have to tell you that. That's really great. So I do have to take down the concern because it's a it's a big one. It's a big thing to get going.
4341280	4369280	So I can't just do it by myself. OK. I'm not giving you a run around. I want to make sure that the concern is noticed logged and we know when it came in and then we can talk about because we're having a meeting next week. Oh wait. You're having a meeting. Yeah. We're going to be doing a town meeting. Shit Martha. Yeah. Where's the where's the notepad. Dan are you pretending to be Caitlin again and bothering your congressman. I got to write down a meeting.
4369280	4394280	I pay your rent. Get me a notepad motherfucker. So there's a meeting. I like to. I want a divorce. Excuse me for a second. Phone down. But then you just hear fucked up shit fucked up shit. I'm not going to do it because it'll be trivializing but I'm just saying like as a writer I'm saying you're fucked up shit.
4394280	4418280	Well I like you hear like the dogs barking and then you hear like somebody like whimpering and like. Yeah. OK. OK. Hey. So I will tell me more about this meeting. I want to be involved in democracy. Where am I going. Why am I doing. Why am I doing that. I'm going to hang up. I'm going to hang up and become myself again. This isn't fair.
4418280	4447280	We call the police. No. Shut up. You shut up. You get in the food hut. Whatever that means. Oh my God. My face. What happened to my face. You get in the food hut. It's the title of the indie movie that will be made about your experience. If you're lucky click. OK. That's what they they they like that. They like human tragedy. Thank you for that nice applause for domestic abuse.
4448280	4477920	That was very nice. That's the part I didn't want to make a cartoon about. I thought I thought like if it was like a rear window thing where you're like oh my God there's a murder. But anyways. And then as like a sad legislative aid I have to like try to figure out what happened. It'd be good. But can I suffice it to say if if you do and there's a million apps and it's a Google away like this idea of calling your Congress person. There's there's pretty much.
4478400	4498640	No chance of of having the experience that you have if you were to call fries electronics or the DMV or your own dentist like like it. The people on the other end of the phone are like like they're they're passionate about politics. Their job is to pick up that phone.
4499120	4518200	You're going to get through it. It's OK to maybe even kind of only like maybe be figuring out what the fuck your problem is like a little bit right. You'd recommend not doing that. Not using it as a therapy session. But at the same time I think the thing that keeps me in line is this fear of I'm just going to feel stupid.
4518200	4535720	I mean again I think well first of all you got to get through to the line because a lot of the times like especially on a big legislative vote they're getting calls from like a billion calls at once. So like the line might get jammed in which case then you can just have quietly experience existential fear.
4535760	4547480	Right. While you're on the hold line. But that's kind of it is kind of comforting though if something happens that you're watching CNN and you're your Internet thing and you're like I'm alarmed about this and you pick up the phone and it's busy.
4548120	4565760	You kind of draw comfort from that right. Like when there's a blackout or like the Internet's out and like you call Time Warner and it's like your call will be answered in 17000 hours and then there's like an added edit in there. If you're calling about the fucking Internet outage it's me or dealing with it.
4567280	4568560	Like yeah that would be nice.
4568560	4596720	I mean that that is totally comforting because it doesn't mean that a lot of other people have the exact same idea that you did when that's always nice to know that I mean I think one of the reasons politics is so hard is because we all feel like a little bit like an island and you you're like oh I'm having all these thoughts or I'm having feelings about politics and I want to get involved and it's like it feels like it's super intimidating like it's so hard to do that first thing and you don't want to go to the meeting and you're afraid that you'll be stupid and like the truth is that we're all stupid.
4597000	4612440	I'm stupid like I got called an activist. I'm not crazy lazy. It's unbelievable how lazy I am. I just sit around and I write things and I have ideas but I haven't been to like one of a political club meeting now in like a year because I'm like the laziest person.
4612720	4627640	I was during the campaign and I did some phone banking but I did it like the laziest way possible from my cell phone using the site because like Hillary created a site and then you could just randomly phone call people from like all these different calls as like this is perfect for me.
4627640	4640520	I'm the laziest person in the world. I worked the floor below her campaign office. I literally landed literally did not go inside of it. So you're saying if you'd worked a little harder Hillary would be an office right.
4642440	4667840	We landed at LAX in the middle of the LAX like when the travel ban went up and we like landed there came out of first class. We had our luggage. Jeff had his suit over his shoulder and we're like oh looks like a protest and we like we hung out there and then for the next three weeks I would shut up about our responsibilities and then I bought a gun because I was just like everything's changing.
4667840	4687360	I want to shoot it for changing. What time is it. We should probably thank you for coming up here. We have more important business to do right now. You know what I think they were being very classy and like didn't want to shout 9 11 like they always do at 9 11. That's very nice.
4687360	4716360	I think I think we were very disappointed in the we live in a. Kaitlyn you think you're lazy for not making phone calls more for these people didn't shout out 9 11 when it was. But yeah I mean I guess I want to make sure there's an action item or something just for people who are more interested. Still have more questions all that stuff. Obviously we've said your Twitter name which is Gotham Girl Blue and citizen citizen zero project.
4716360	4746240	That's that is that the Twitter handle or that is actually that's not my Twitter handle that is the site. I literally just upgraded it with all the stuff that the nonprofit that I'm working on is going to do. I can't take donations yet. I'm hoping to do so as of August 1st. But like there are literal projects that I'm working on whether or not that's creating discussion groups and training other people to lead them whether that is creating the online portal and the app. So that way you can do more passive citizenship and you don't have to actually collect all that news by yourself.
4746240	4761480	Because that sucks or whether or not it's creating a K through 8 curriculum because I'm working on getting kids to understand that they're citizens. So that way you build the habits early and then you don't have to worry about doing it as an adult because you're already been doing it. Yeah that's right.
4761480	4790560	Yeah. OK. Well it's here for Kaitlyn Bird everybody. Look her up and she'll be back and we'll continue to maybe how we can help you in Los Angeles. We'll be like sister cities. All right. Thank you Kaitlyn. The rest of the show will make no sense to you. But you can go watch it with Ronald. Unless unless you've been listening. All right. So let's bring up Steve Levy.
4790560	4793760	Steve Levy to the stage.
4794600	4814160	Levy in the house. Steve Levy. Steve Levy. Steve Levy is upstairs doing lines off another guy's wiener to leave. Steve Levy everybody.
4815000	4823680	I'm sorry church. Church was telling me a fascinating story. Steve.
4823680	4830660	Say what. No church was telling me a fascinating story backstage and I. About what. Just personal stuff.
4830660	4841980	In a in a more primitive society that would be a huge like like you came on stage and
4841980	4845300	so like yeah your girlfriend was off stage telling me some shit I can't talk about.
4845300	4849340	Well I don't I don't I don't want to you don't want to cause no trouble.
4849340	4855760	Yeah this is not a forum to disclose anyone's stories. Don't necessarily I don't know.
4856000	4862560	Yeah. All right. What's going on. I mean we can't tell you. All right.
4862560	4867600	We got a little I got a little educated. I think I think the most important thing I learned is that
4867600	4873360	it is that membrane. Like I'm bad on the phone man. Like I tell people to call their Congress
4873360	4881680	people at the drop of a fucking hat and I stand before you naked and trembling at the prospect.
4881680	4884960	We've been on a lot of phone calls together and I'm going to say some of them.
4884960	4890160	You're really great. Others not so great. What is the difference do you think.
4891680	4896400	How much attention you're paying and how much you actually care about what we're talking about.
4896400	4901840	Maybe right. So a bad phone call but one in which like everybody wants something from me
4901840	4907600	and I don't know why I'm on the call. I don't know. Sometimes you turn those around and it's
4907600	4912720	like you're a hero. But other you know I can't I want to make you name examples so bad.
4913680	4919520	But it'll only hurt me. And you just have this luxury. You're like a Ferris in Game of Thrones.
4919520	4925280	I don't know who that is. Look it up. Yeah. All right. You'll look I don't watch Game of Thrones.
4925280	4936480	Yes. It's cool. So so for those of you just joining us tonight we now play a game called
4936480	4942080	Pathfinder which is kind of like Dungeons and Dragons. Whoa laptop. Hey guys. I'm just checking
4942080	4949920	to read it. Hey did you. Did you. Did you have any thoughts about. I haven't checked in with
4949920	4955040	you politically. I mean I know you and I both feel like the world's probably ending. Oh yeah.
4955040	4961840	You're still getting your ham radio license. Oh man. It's going great. It seems like it's really
4961840	4967360	hard though. I could see why they don't want everyone just doing it. I saw on a Friday
4967360	4974720	something about a ham radio. Is that. Whoa. Where are you. Are you doing. Are you building a radio
4974720	4981760	on a Friday. I'm building a radio on Friday. All right. And it's going to be the biggest radio
4981760	4989520	ever seen on the West Coast. Is your new hobby lying. I'm working on my improv.
4992560	5000480	I'm yelling at it. I know I did this podcast. I did this podcast. It's called a UCB radio.
5001680	5007280	I did this podcast on Saturday and I really I really just feel like I shit the bed. And so like
5007280	5014480	I just just want to die. It's just. Oh man. I just am feeling the worst. Really. Yeah. And everyone
5014480	5019680	should download it and not listen it. So everyone thinks oh wow it really performed really well.
5020480	5025280	But then don't listen to it because otherwise you won't even be able to be honest about you know.
5025280	5028880	What did you think you did. What are you most embarrassed about. I just I feel like I'm
5028880	5035200	mechanically bad at talking. Like if there were a race of talking I would lose. Like I would be
5035200	5044160	like a fat person at talking. Like like you talk a lot. You know I do. But as a result. Are you
5044160	5051200	calling him fat. No he's he's calling me. He's the marathon man of talking. Yeah. Well like you
5051200	5055680	know Malcolm Gladwell without ten thousand hours. It's like you've had a lot of practice at talking
5055680	5061360	but I feel like I probably just don't talk very much and I'm bad at it as a result. Well I don't
5061360	5066640	perceive it that way. Well I'm just saying that like what. Thank you so much. See what matter. What
5066720	5080960	was it. Thank you. That's so nice. It's definitely a soothing voice. Like that's just but I just I
5080960	5085840	don't know. Just couldn't make sense. It was just bad. It's bad news. I don't even want to talk. Well
5085840	5090160	especially you have a chance for redemption right now because now is your chance to talk as you
5090160	5099280	recap our last episode of Pathfinder D&D. That's okay. I wanted to I wanted to help him with his
5099280	5106800	anxieties. We could have just teed up the worst D&D ever because he's like yeah I feel like I'm
5106800	5113120	bad at talking. I fall asleep to you talking. I'll see you're good at talking. Yeah maybe. Well let's
5113120	5124080	do D&D. You're in a forest. Fuck. You come upon me in a rope. I'm in the middle of something.
5125760	5129680	I don't know. I'm not saying you did anything wrong. I'm just saying like I was worried about.
5129680	5134240	I wanted to like put a pin in it or not to put a pin in it. Acupuncture pin. I'm fine. Do you think
5134240	5139680	acupuncturists have when they say put a pin in it they do you think they get confused. I could just
5139680	5145280	stand up. I could do stand up. That's a stand up. Do you think acupuncturists get confused? Like
5145280	5149280	why do you mean what do you why do people keep talking about putting a pin in it? That means deal
5149280	5154320	with it right now. When when you tell them to put a pin in they're always finishing the task.
5155120	5159040	They're like yeah they're like an acupuncturist but he comes to your book club and goes like
5159040	5162720	well I think we should have a policy for which books we choose. Well let's put a pin in that.
5162720	5170400	I'm trying. I'm trying too. Putting a pin right now. Where was this at the top of the show? You're
5170400	5177280	only you're only four and a half minutes away from a set. You got you got that one in 92.
5178480	5183360	All right anyway sorry I got excited about that but I want to put an acupuncture pin in your uh
5183360	5191280	tits. And now we don't want to deal with it now. He wants to put a pin in your tits.
5192240	5198320	I mean who doesn't these things? Well it's it's fine. I just wanted to express that because you
5198320	5204160	know it might come out on the internet sometimes that I was on a podcast and I don't want anyone
5204160	5208720	to listen to it but I do want them to download it. What I what I admire about you and I think
5209840	5214560	a lot of our audience would agree with me is that when you talk it's you call your shots and it's
5214560	5220880	usually very accurate. I was bad. I agree with that in a general sense on my best times but I
5220960	5224880	was just off my game. It's like you know it's just sometimes you have pet pee. Yeah you know
5224880	5229760	it was just bad but now I'm just I'm just sitting in it. I'm like man I just fucked up.
5230720	5234880	I went out I went on Kumail and Emily's podcast once and I was so fucking happy
5234880	5238080	because all they wanted to do was talk about video games because that's the whole podcast
5238080	5241520	was about. Oh yeah. I was so excited just to talk about video games. I walked out of there
5241520	5247680	so happy and then like I read two tweets. Right. Like no one's gonna like tweet and go like that
5247680	5252960	was fine. That was fine. Like it was the two guys were like don't let Harmon explain computer
5252960	5257760	science ever again. He doesn't get it. That's not was like he tried it like like I'm always
5257760	5262320	like wrong about shit. I feel awful. I want to go into a cave and like eat my own leg. Yeah.
5264160	5271040	It's not I don't. Eating doesn't solve all your problems. But unless you eat your own body then
5271040	5276000	you're the new it solves itself. It solves. Yeah. It's kind of like weight loss. If you could turn
5276000	5281040	your own body into poop you'd lose weight. You could poop your own leg. Eat your own leg
5281040	5288560	and then you got one leg less than I did before. I ate my leg. But a smart person would say yes
5288560	5294400	but you just cut your ability to exercise in half and you're gonna regret that. You're gonna
5294400	5297600	be sitting there and you're gonna be eating. You're not gonna be able to eat much anymore
5297600	5303520	and you're gonna slowly die. So what I'm saying to you is I get it.
5306000	5310000	Just keep hanging out with me and you'll always you'll always look better.
5313040	5322400	Last time on Harmon time. What happened. You guys had just finished the fight and you
5322480	5328000	beat the ghost. No you beat the demon freeing the ghost and it took you to the graveyard.
5328000	5334400	You discovered that in place of Archer fells the corpse was the corpse of a rotting dog.
5334960	5339760	It was fucked up and then you left. You went to dairy hill and met with Rhonda who took you
5339760	5346160	met to meet the the other farmer Manil because it seemed that the farmers were dealing with some
5346160	5352800	ripped murdered cows and Manil was being weird for a while but diarrhea junior unleashed the
5352800	5360560	snacks and it seemed to be winning him over and that's where we left it in Manil's farmhouse.
5363520	5371200	Yeah. Even that terrible showing was much better than anything I did. It might have been largely
5371200	5377360	our fault. No I'm saying that if you called that good what I did on that podcast was bad.
5379680	5383600	All you're making me do is want to listen to this podcast more than I would have already.
5383600	5388960	Right. Well do that. This sounds like you're just pumping up the show that you're trying to like.
5388960	5392960	I just want to I just want people to go well at least he at least he knew.
5394640	5399040	It's a good point I mean that's what propels me. Right. I'm like yeah at least he knew. At least
5399120	5404800	he knew. You can't shoot me through a hole I self-inflicted. Right. You missed again. They never
5404800	5410480	get it. They're like bang bang bang. What's that hole I'll shoot at it. You're like that hurts too.
5412000	5415280	Shot myself there an hour ago you fucking plead.
5419920	5425600	What's on the sheet? I don't know. I do that with menus too. I know Cody busted me today.
5425680	5430640	I already ordered and I was just like and she's like you ordered put the menu down.
5431680	5439840	I don't I'm uncomfortable in life. You know what DJ you're all right. Then he starts taking the
5439840	5446720	snacks out of your hands. You like that. Are you enjoying those snacks Donovan. Oh yeah. You know
5446720	5453840	you're a lot cooler than that guy fell. Yeah that Tom he's a real piece of shit. You know his
5454480	5459520	his cows they suck. All he did you know he's a bad farmer. All the farm crops he was doing he
5459520	5464080	was just trying to feed his cows with them. He put all your eggs in one basket. That's how it
5464080	5469920	happens. I'll go one step further. I'd say he's a bad father. He let his son get killed. I'll go
5469920	5474720	one step further. I'll say I wish that someone would go to his house light his house on fire.
5474720	5481360	Maybe put it out. Well I'm up. Maybe throw a rock at his wife. Don't you. Jonathan. Jonathan
5481360	5486240	we're one step ahead of you as always. What are you talking about. Not only did we go to his house
5486240	5492240	once we went we fucked his house up twice. Oh Jesus. Go knock on his front door. You can't.
5492240	5498800	It's on fire in his front room right now. This is what democracy looks like. You you have a vision
5498800	5503440	of what the world should look like when you're living in it. We already did it. We're good
5503440	5509760	representatives of your church. Right. So why don't you reward us with some good old-fashioned
5509760	5515600	information. Okay. Let's get down to business and hang out. Talk about what a piece of shit
5515600	5520880	Tom fell is and what's been going on in this town. Why the evil is coming to town. Like who's to
5520880	5526400	blame. Where can we track down the evil like as it's happening. I don't know man. I'm sitting on
5526400	5530560	a couple of cow corpses if you want to check them out. Yeah well thank you. Let's go do that right
5530560	5534480	this out. That's what we asked in the first place. You're full of snacks. Let's go out there and check
5534480	5540080	out these cow corpse. All right he uh he turns around and he he pulls a sheet off of two cow
5540080	5546320	corpses in his main room. He's been standing in uh we've been standing in a room with cow corpses.
5546320	5550800	Yeah it looked like like just furniture or something at first. How long have they been
5550800	5556880	dead for? Uh this one's been dead for three days. This one's been dead for a week. I do the uh the
5556880	5563200	dust check on the cow corpse. I do a little. The the crop yeah. Dust check. They had a sheet over
5563200	5569040	them so they're not dusty. I'm sorry what was your name again? Manil. Manil. Donovan Manil. Donovan
5569040	5574640	I'm not judging you. You it's an objective truth that you downplayed the cattle mutilation when we
5574640	5580400	came to see you. Well I you know. Did you drag the corpses in here or were they murdered in this room?
5580400	5586080	Well Rhonda helped me but no they weren't murdered in this room. I would have seen who done it. No
5586080	5590480	I'm just you know I'm fired up about that son of a bitch Tom and that's what you came in talking
5590480	5594640	about you know it's just. It's how we got into your good graces but initially there was like a
5594640	5598960	kind of a force field around the topic of cattle mutilation. Yeah it was because I was so angry.
5598960	5605440	Do you think Tom fell murdered your cows? I don't know you'd have to be some sort of monster to be
5605440	5613360	able to pull that out. Off not out. Do you mind if my team and I who are clerical professionals
5613360	5619840	from a church which at this time in this class of society is also the equivalent of being doctors
5621360	5627920	could we check out your mutilated cows? He puts the sheet back over the cows and then he pulls
5627920	5635680	the sheet off again. Well are you being a little cutesy? No I'm just trying to reiterate. Oh you're
5635680	5641120	saying that when you pull a sheet off a cow the invitation to explore is implicit. Yeah and I'm
5641120	5646880	a fool for asking permission. Well you know that was just fun with you. I wasn't doing that other
5646960	5652080	thing. Yeah well now when I fuck with you don't complain sorry I've been drinking.
5655520	5661120	I'm assuming my spell of handle animal won't work on dead cows probably right? No no well that's
5661120	5668560	that's yeah no. Dario examine the cows get in there. Okay I use my knowledge of nature
5668560	5678160	on the cows. What's your what's your bonus there? Uh nine. All right um this cow's still alive.
5678720	5684160	Oh I I use handle animal and I try to I try to convene with the animal to communicate with
5684160	5688160	this animal and find out what happened. It won't move. I have this I have this I have this
5688160	5694720	stabilize load out uh yes load out one general it's off uh stabilize I have a spell
5694720	5700160	cause a dying creature to stabilize. Don't panic the key is to not panic.
5701360	5705440	You cast it and it doesn't affect it almost as if it's dead and not alive.
5706160	5708160	What you said it was alive. Oh yeah.
5711920	5716240	Is it my turn it's not my turn anymore is it? Yeah I'll just yeah just roll the one. Oh shit
5717200	5725840	zombie. I I use I use heal on the animal. All right it doesn't work. Shit zombie. I I I check
5725840	5732960	for dust on the animal. It's not dusty. Does it does a cow? It's a coping mechanism. When I
5732960	5739520	fuck up I I pretend like I know what I'm doing and I do. Zombie. I also sharpen a pencil. I do
5739520	5744800	I do things that make it look like I know. Does the cow have open wounds? Uh yeah the cow looks
5744800	5751200	like it has these big like like like slash marks you know like from a big creature. Can I
5752640	5758960	can I use my magnifying lens to look closer at the wounds? Yeah. It's a zombie cow.
5760800	5769600	It's an undead cow. You see that the cow's clearly dead. It uh but alive but not alive. Was it like
5769600	5774400	wait wait wait a minute. You said it was kind of alive. Yeah I did say that.
5774400	5778800	So undead. Well can I just Jeff looked at it he thought it was alive.
5780160	5789200	Oh his because I he he rolled that well. Oh so I'm just an idiot. Yeah it's a weird thing.
5789200	5795040	They I rolled so low I thought a dead thing was alive. Oh man and he's the smartest of all three
5795040	5805120	of us. Why don't we just open up a restaurant. Stop being fucking church people. Can can I
5805120	5811840	determine whether it's like claws or or a weapon that yeah they look like big kind of big claws
5811840	5820160	big five five clawed claws you know like a claw. Oh looks like a monster of some kind murdered
5820160	5833040	these cows. A monster of some kind. Never studied. Knowledge. You can't just say the word knowledge.
5836880	5844240	Knowledge. Knowledge arcana knowledge history knowledge nobility in case the werewolf that
5844320	5852480	attack this cow is a duke. Knowledge planes because it's happening on a plane. Knowledge religion.
5852480	5856960	I mean I'm running through the gambit. I have really nothing in all of them. They're just
5856960	5861840	checked off because I'm a cleric. Oh you don't have any of this. Well it doesn't I mean it
5861840	5868160	I mean I have them all checked off. Yeah knowledge religion is two. Okay well it's we could try that
5868160	5878320	one. Yeah. You're gonna find out if this cow is religious. This cow is Mormon. That's fantastic.
5879360	5884560	Um it just seems like it seems like some sort of otherworldly creature uh you know you can't
5884560	5889200	really see what you don't know what it is like whether it's like a werewolf or like a demon
5889200	5893760	or whatever you don't know what it is but it's definitely some sort of big monster rather than
5893840	5899040	like a natural beast. But it looks like the same monster killed both of these cows. Yeah yeah it's
5899040	5904800	consistent. And one was seven days ago and one was three days ago. Right. Looks like there's a monster
5904800	5915360	roaming the land. Look look look if if I'm doing the math right seven to you know three maybe it's
5915360	5920320	every four days and because this was three days ago in the next day maybe another cow will be
5920320	5927600	murdered. How often farmer uh Manil. Manil does the does this uh take place every four days about?
5927600	5932800	Well it's been speeding up it actually it was happening like once every month or so but then
5932800	5938480	you know these past two have been like once every two weeks and then more than once a week and so
5938480	5944400	the creature is gaining strength and confidence. Well what if we take what if we side I pull I pull
5944400	5951200	diarrhea and Carlos aside. What if we dress up like these dead cows and go out in the field
5951920	5957520	and like wait for. Yeah we should definitely do a stakeout. How long has it been since the last
5957520	5965200	cow got mutilated? Three days. Three days? No four days. He said three days. He said three days.
5965200	5970720	Do you have live cows still? No there's no more cows. There's no more cows? No they all got killed.
5970720	5976160	There's just two here? Yeah we're a small town there's only about 10 cows. Okay so what if we
5976160	5981360	gut one of these cows and then we wear it and pretend that we're a cow in the field. Do we
5981360	5988880	have your permission to use your otherwise wasted cows as costumes? Uh I don't know I mean you're
5988880	5994960	gonna have to buy them off me because like you know I could still use this meat. Wait one more
5994960	6001280	question did Tom fell have any of his cows murdered? Oh yeah yeah many we should go over
6001280	6007040	there actually. What? Oh yeah he's got the most mutilated cows in town. Look there's a
6007040	6013440	couple bargain at twice the price. Yeah he's he's giving his cows away. He doesn't deserve any money.
6013440	6017360	You know how Tom fell works. No no we wouldn't look there's some options we have right we could
6017360	6022640	we could steal a cow from Tom and bring it back here or we could pay him for a live cow and bring
6022640	6029920	it back here. Bottom bottom is bottom is bottom line is hoping to solve the problem that keeps
6029920	6036400	killing everyone's cows right uh might give a no-bid contract to Tom fell. Yeah is it true that
6036400	6040880	you and Tom fell have been price fixing uh your your your cow meat because you're the only two
6041840	6049280	ranches in town? No. Okay we'll give you one gold piece for each of these cows. No no wait wait
6049280	6056640	one bronze. Wait wait let let this good church of the silver flame do some you know
6057600	6062160	let me do some negotiation here. Yeah right okay this feels like a stereotype but
6065280	6073600	I'm gonna talk yeah yeah I'll I'll lean into it. Okay um do you have any what other problems you
6073600	6077360	got around the house? I mean look we we're knowledgeable and we could we could we can
6077360	6085920	barter we could fix some stuff for the cows. Yeah fix the cows. No that's that's not fixable
6085920	6091200	is it? I don't know. Are you just get the best price for the cows we're all right we want to
6091200	6096000	we want to take the cows. Yeah they're dead they're dead corpses what are you asking how many?
6096000	6101440	That's what happens at the end of a cow you get a dead cow and then you sell pieces of her for
6101440	6109760	money. That's part of being a farmer. I uh I conjure a flame in my hand and just hold the flame
6111600	6120560	threateningly like what what oh all right do you have a charisma or an intimidate? You better
6120560	6132560	believe it. I'm 13 charisma and intimidates yeah fuck yeah intimidate nope but 13 charisma
6132560	6138080	with a flame in my hand I mean look I'm a gnome I know I'm short but I a dude holding a fireball
6138080	6144320	in his hand it's like I'll fucking I'll cook these cows right now he's like whoa man I don't

6370800	6375520	you guys are big enough to look like cows i'm a gnome i i i won't look like no i think that what
6375520	6380800	should happen is look i'll do the cow i'll look like a cow with you but when if this creature
6380800	6387040	comes when it comes jeff should light a ring of fire and entrap it in our little ring so we could
6387040	6392960	square off with it okay yeah i mean i i've also got a ranged bow of 100 feet uh with with piercing
6393920	6398960	and uh and i and i can shoot fireballs i can light i can light this monster up with fire
6398960	6404880	okay so you're gonna stay back and watch over the perimeter i'm gonna hide gnome like in a haystack
6405520	6412960	nearby you guys are gonna look like just two two regular workaday cows okay my mind and their
6412960	6419360	biz maybe they look a little worse worse for wear i don't think this thing's picky whatever it is
6419360	6424560	yeah right yeah he's here to see two cows moving about and go oh easy pickings what time is it in
6424560	6431920	the day uh uh well it's been two hours so it's like one eight uh one pm okay all right all right
6431920	6439920	well why don't we um we're well fed you guys go get uh put your cow costume on uh let's work on
6439920	6444320	your cow movements yeah let's practice the yeah you have a training montage where we learn to act
6444320	6450480	like cows what time general way that you moves it uh does this thing come at night moves it what
6450480	6454240	does it does the creature come at night yeah the attacks have happened at night all right i mean i
6454480	6458720	answered that all right let's go let's go learn to move like cows
6460320	6463600	backyard okay does it feel like it's working who's watching
6465120	6469280	i'm watching you guys um more bovine more bovine
6470720	6476640	do they move one back foot and one front foot at the same time is it like
6477600	6484400	yeah i think it's contrapedal i think i think they go like yeah i think exactly like one one
6484400	6489280	forward on the front one forward on the back yeah that's the that was the whole point of
6489280	6494320	yeah all right biology which says people would move like hieroglyphics you guys are moving too
6494320	6498240	much cows don't really move around all that much yeah i mean i'm just like want to look
6498240	6503440	like while i'm standing still look like prey look like easy food yeah yeah yeah
6504400	6510960	all right am i doing it i can't tell i i i lay down like a like a naked farmer so you guys can
6510960	6516560	suck my dick and kiss my and kiss me on the face that's a that's a callback to another episode

6546720	6553280	all right so that took like an hour oh yeah now it's okay so now now it's time to lay low
6553360	6557440	we're well we're well fed we're well trained now it's a waiting game
6559600	6566480	for the monster to attack make sure that beneath your cowhide uniforms that you guys have your
6566480	6572960	weapons ready to rock all right let's just take a quick inventory are we are we are we doing
6572960	6578640	everything right like just in a larger sense like when i came to this i don't see how this
6578720	6583920	plan could possibly fail i just i just i just want to ask like are we focused on the right
6583920	6590080	priorities because yeah we did get sidetracked by what could be called like a distraction like i
6590080	6595520	don't know okay while while carlos is saying all this i'm getting really method in eating the grass
6595520	6603680	okay i i'm making i'm making a ring of um like an open like kind of open-ended ring of hay
6604320	6610080	i can light on fire that's a great plan we can lure the monster into that and then you guys
6610080	6615120	could jump over i don't know maybe like we just trap it in a hay fire and i can cast a fire bolt
6615120	6622000	and like don't eat the ring of hay he's putting that out there for a reason yeah i okay so we got
6622000	6628640	we got we got to the town and uh we stopped off and we harassed a local and then we went to the
6628640	6633440	church and then the church we had a we had an uncomfortable conversation with we couldn't
6633440	6638480	figure out what's going on with them so we went back to the first people and just we we did we
6638480	6645360	expelled a ghost the ghost led us to the cemetery the cemetery led us to a dog a dog in the place
6645360	6650640	of their dead daughter we talked to a farmer that was just standing there that's that's where this
6650640	6655360	breaks down like we're not we're we're we're breaking off from the a story we talked to the
6655360	6663360	watch lady uh ronda who led us to the other farmer who said who sold us his cow hides
6664240	6669680	but in a six person town i would say something that's killing two of the people's cows yeah we
