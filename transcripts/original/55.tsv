0	17080	Hear ye! Hear ye! The Cinco de Mayo edition of Hormontown is in session. Please welcome
17080	39480	the Mayor of Hormontown, Dan Harmon! Thank you. Guest Comptroller, Kumail Nanjiani. Anybody
39480	45840	come here to see Jeff Davis tonight? Haha! Y'all just got fucked. Just wanted to make
45840	51840	sure. You brought him something? Oh, what did you bring him? Herpes? He can't get it
51840	60400	twice. Yeah, he's got it. No, you can't look that handsome and not have herpes. Ginger
60400	66960	snap super cookies. For you in podcast land, experiencing this only through audio, a guy
66960	74240	who looks, I would describe as a sleepy Scott Thompson from Kids in the Hall in an Oxford
74240	80080	shirt sitting by himself with a satchel between his legs said, I brought Jeff something and
80080	85820	unzipped the satchel and pulled out a sealed bag of super cookies. Those are probably vegan
85820	91040	cookies, right? Right, right. And it's because I also brought meat. You also brought meat.
91040	95840	Oh, you didn't want him to be left out. Okay, he's saying, I also brought meat. Sir, what's
95840	100640	your name? But what's that? Bill. Would you like to come up here? I mean, you brought
100640	110640	meat. What's the backstory on the meat? We're about to find out. I mean, that's why. Yeah,
110640	114120	okay. I got to feel this is one of these people that I don't want to keep repeating what he's
114120	119880	saying in the front row. Bill looked at me like, come on, you know what the meat's about.
119880	125080	Nobody knows. All right, go ahead. Okay, so have you ever had a food that you were like,
125080	133280	oh my god, this is so awesome. I have to share it. Yeah. Yeah. You're like a great
133280	140880	pitch man already. No, no, no, no. No, really. No, shared it with everybody. Yeah, have you
140880	150800	ever cut an onion? Okay, beef jerky smoked teriyaki beef jerky. It's in a bag. Where
150800	156400	is this from? Tell us what Texas. Okay, you flew that back from Texas. It's now it was
156400	163400	shipped here. It's packaged a lot like you would imagine c4 or just poison beef jerky.
163400	168800	All right. All right. All right. See, I knew, I knew somebody would say that. Now, my dad
168800	174880	used to say, it really does look like poison. Yeah. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Come on. Like,
174880	178960	there are, if you look at the ingredients, there's no poison on the label. If you're
178960	183800	poisoning something, you're not going to scrap, scratch poison on the right. But also,
183800	188280	if you notice in the package, there's also little floss things for your teeth, right?
188280	192760	So if you're going to die, you better like have clean teeth. Yeah, you brought us floss
192760	199280	too, because I'm sorry, but where are you from? Plain Plainville, Wisconsin. A lot of
199280	207200	different. I've actually lived a lot of different places. I've lived a lot of different places.
207280	213600	I grew up in Indiana. Okay. Moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, then moved to Australia, then moved
213600	221280	to Vancouver, Canada, then to Texas. Now I'm not here. Where in Australia? Brisbane. All
221280	227440	right. Brisbane, Queensland. If you said Melbourne. Seems legit. Yeah. All right. Instead of starting
227440	231440	from the beginning and going forward, let's start from, from tonight where you show up
231440	236080	with a satchel full of meat and step slightly backward. Oh, well I was just out there. I was
236080	239680	out there waiting in line. Right. Okay. A little backward from that. Like to the point where you
239680	244800	decide to come to the show with a satchel full of meat. Yeah, yeah. Why? Like tell us what,
244800	250000	tell us about, you said you, one thing is that you just, you're very excited about this jerky,
250000	254800	right? You said if you ever had a. Yeah, yeah, but, but I, I didn't need to come up on stage to share
254800	259200	it. Right. You just, you just brought, you brought it because you, it's so good. Yeah, yeah. And it's
259200	263360	from, and I was really concerned that you go, oh, that's very nice, but did you bring enough for
263360	271680	the rest of the class? I actually do have a couple more bags. Oh my God. Most of our curiosity ended
271680	279280	at, there's, there's two, okay. There's two in there. If you could open it up, do explain it to
279280	286640	people. He is throwing out sacks and sacks of beef jerky. So much beef jerky. There's two in there.
286640	297040	Just in Ziploc bags too. That's how it's packaged. Like it's, that's how it's packaged. Yeah. Yeah.
297040	303200	I can read the headlines tomorrow. It's packaged in little brown paper bags with packing tape. Yeah.
303920	310080	Creator of community dies along with 30 of his biggest fans. Wouldn't it be crazy? Like, like,
310080	316080	like, that would be such a crazy, like a weird, all of a sudden the word meltdown would be like
316080	322480	9 11 or Boston, you know, like it would just be like weird thing that happened for the next 15
322480	328480	years. Everyone would go like, oh man, I had a meltdown thing. That guy, the beef jerky. Jeff
328480	334080	is going to become a holy man. David Letterman would be making jokes about it, like references
334080	342960	to it. Like, no, Jay Leno would, Leno would have the dancing beef jerkies. Well, thank you. Thank
342960	354160	you, Bill, for your mysterious jerky. Thank you, Bill. Are you going to try it, Dan? Not just right
354160	359600	now. I mean, it's, it's, you know what, it would take so long to open the package. And if it
359600	364880	wouldn't take so long to open the package, then maybe I'll never eat it. It's, it's, it's sort of
364880	377600	somebody just brought in some jerky. What flavor is that, sir? Is that the teriyaki? Does it say
377600	384560	hot? Oh, can I try it? How much sugar is it? Like a lot of beef jerky has a lot of sugar in it. People
384560	395840	don't know that. It is one of the ingredients. It's really good. Can I, can you throw me one,
395840	405600	mister? I'll catch it. Just throw it. All right. That was a terrible throw. Thank you. Thank you.
405600	415360	Is it, is it weird or is it perfectly normal that everyone's first thought? It's, it's human
415360	420080	flash. It's poison, you know, like, like, like, like whenever. I don't think we're weird. Weird
420080	426880	is the guy who brought tons of beef jerky. All right. So one, somebody in the audience is like
426880	433920	offering up once it has, or it has cultures of fungus, fungus growing on it. Is this all fungus?
433920	439280	I would not eat any of that. Bill, how could you? All right. One of the, one of the, Bill's,
439280	444160	Bill's holding his head in shame. And Bill, you didn't make this, right? He just, he just brought
444160	449840	it. It's very, very good. Thank you. Thank you so much. All right. Texas. All right. Dried beef
449840	455040	from Texas, shipped in a plastic bag. Some, some air got into one of them and life, life found a
455040	463120	way, as Dr. Ian Malcolm would say. He would, he would warn you about that. This one has a little
463200	471840	bit of it too on there. And I fucking took a bite of it. Yeah, me too. Bill? Bill. I bit into it
471840	476720	thinking it would be cool if we all died or if it turned out to be people, but the, but the boring,
476720	481440	sadder, more realistic thing is that we'd all just like spend the next three days shitting and puking.
482400	487600	Yeah. Jay Leno's not doing jokes about that. Yeah. No one's going to care about that. That's like a
487600	493280	bachelor party gone awry. We just have three shitty days. Uh, all right. Pulling up my, uh,
493280	500160	ever note, note, note app. Um, oh, so, okay. So I wanted to ask you something as a new comptroller.
500160	505360	Like this is the kind of question I would ask Jeff. No, no, I'm a hypochondriac. So now I feel
505360	514080	like I ate fungus and well, you should feel like it because you did. I was sitting, I've, I've, I've,
514320	518640	I've been, I've been sitting in my bed playing a lot of Minecraft on my laptop. I got a new
518640	523920	souped up, uh, Mac, MacBook. And, uh, I, uh, I've been playing a lot of Minecraft. I'm totally
523920	530880	distracted by the thought of like, just, I can feel it growing inside. My, my inside is something
530880	538880	of a giant spider web right now. Uh, I was listening to the people next door outside my window. They
538880	542880	were having some kind of party in the backyard and they were having a lot of fun. You know,
542880	546880	there's a distinctive sound to an outdoor party. Everyone's having a good time. And I was sitting
546880	552480	in bed playing Minecraft on my laptop and I, I didn't feel left out and I was happy that they
552480	556320	were having a party and I started to think, you know, I should, I should just have people come
556320	561920	over to my house and have a party in the backyard, but not invite myself. And I could just sit and
561920	569600	play Minecraft. Okay. Is that, is that agoraphobia or is that just, I know it's a, I know it's a tough
569600	577840	evite to craft. I heard stories of like, like, like, like you're out in LA and everybody works
577840	582640	for somebody. Somebody's an assistant to so-and-so. I've heard stories about Eddie Murphy that he, uh,
582640	588160	he, uh, he, uh, he would have these big parties. He has these big parties, uh, post Pluto Nash,
588160	593280	Eddie Murphy has these parties, uh, where just like he, because he's Eddie Murphy, he just like,
593280	598800	he could just invite a million people and he has people like throw a party and he kind of like hangs
598800	604240	back and he'll make an appearance on a balcony and kind of wave to people with the Pope. And then,
604240	607920	and then like there'll be a certain point where everybody gets kicked out, but up until then,
607920	610640	uh, they're, they're just partying at Eddie Murphy's house, but they're not partying with
610640	615920	Eddie Murphy. I actually liked that idea because I, I do like going to parties, but I can also
615920	621200	understand like some days I'm like, I just want a party to happen like around me. I want to hear it,
621200	625680	but I don't want to participate in it. And it does sound like if you're playing Minecraft and people
625680	630480	are having fun outside and it's your doing, you made all this fun happen. That's awesome.
630480	634720	Listening to it. You know, I used to, and it reminded me that I used to sit backstage at
634720	640240	the comedy tent in Milwaukee. What is the comedy tent? It's Summerfest. This is where I would meet
640240	644000	like your various headliners would come through town and you're, you're, you're Richard Lewis's
644000	648080	and you're, uh, Louie Anderson's and you're, you're John Stewart's and things. And you'd,
648080	653760	you'd pick their brains. You're Bob Goldthwaite's for instance. Uh, and, and, and, uh, and like I
653760	658160	remember I would sit backstage and listen to the headliners entertain like 3000 people and I would
658160	663200	just, I just liked the sound of them laughing and having a good time. But I didn't want to,
663200	668320	it's weird because you'd think of me as a very narcissistic, vain, control, freaky, ego-driven
668320	673280	guy. Like I would like, Oh, I know. I want to be the reason why they're laughing. Maybe, maybe I'm
673280	676880	a better person than you think. Maybe I just want people to be having a good time. And maybe if you
676880	681200	want something done right, you have to do it yourself. So I, I think you just explained
681200	689200	narcissism. I certainly just exemplified it. Um, all right. Well, I have a quick question
689200	695600	about Richard Lewis. You met him. What was he like? Uh, he's really suave and, uh, um,
695600	700720	he wears a lot of bright colors. Like he gets off stage and he's like, Oh, get it off, get it off.
700720	707200	This, this black turtleneck, uh, this trench coat. Uh, I, I, I can't, I honestly, I can't remember,
707200	710560	like the, most of those guys, it was like, I never wanted to be a nuisance. I remember
710560	716160	Jon Stewart being really cool. Yeah. Really nice. As you would imagine, he would, uh, I, I,
716160	720560	that sticks out in my head. I remember Bob Goldthwaite being incredibly like forthcoming and,
720560	726640	and, and, and, you know, talking to us, Tom Kenny. I remember giving me a shrub, like, uh,
726640	732160	like, like advice that I still give to young people, uh, create creatively. Oh,
732160	738000	what is his advice? Become the voice of Spongebob. Yeah. And then just break it in.
738480	745200	We asked him as a, you know, like a kind of a dipshit hacky question, which is what's your advice
745200	750480	for young comics? And he said, go through your set list and cross off everything that didn't
750480	754800	make you laugh out loud by yourself when you were writing it. And we were like, but that's like our
754800	762880	whole, Oh, and there is like one thing out of your first 10 minutes, that's going to be that one
762880	768160	thing. You know, you gotta ditch the other nine. And that's, that's why Patton Oswalt is hysterical
768160	773680	after all these decades of, of, of going through that. He does that every time. Yeah. Works that
773680	777920	shit. Yeah. Because I definitely, because I've performed, you know, you perform in places where
777920	783200	like Idaho and stuff where you, it's not, people aren't gonna, you just assume people are going to
783200	787840	be a certain way. So I would go back to the jokes that don't make me laugh, but that work in every
787840	794560	room. I mean, this will be, I'm saying got milk, but instead of milk, I'm saying a poop. Yeah. I
794560	799760	mean, I've, I've heard people laugh at that in that piranha movie. Yeah. Got poop. Right. Yeah.
799760	805680	Yeah. Exactly. This'll make other people laugh because, you know, this is the concept of comedy
805680	811280	instead of you going like, here's a thing that I think is funny. It's a big mistake. That's not,
811280	816880	that's not what anybody would, no one's going to buy a ticket to that. That's even people who like
816880	822400	watching Tim Allen's thing, whatever it's called, man, man, man, man, man, man zone.
826080	832080	They feel like, you know, he's speaking from the heart and making himself laugh. Like that's just,
832080	837760	you know, that, like, they don't, they wouldn't want him to like, stop the, go like, stop.
838560	848160	Uh, what should man's own do next? Yeah. Uh, tweet, tweet to manzone.com and let me know.
849280	854080	And I'll do whatever you want, whatever you want. And my mom would be like, fuck this guy.
855360	860320	The whole illusion is that you're just sort of speaking up there and you're not really speaking
860320	865680	for the benefit of any person, but just for yourself. And that would, that would kill that.
865680	871200	Although I would love if he did like was once, you know what, fuck this. This is not who I am.
871200	876720	I did, you know, I did cocaine really a lot for like 15 years. Don't you want to hear about that?
877520	882560	I want to hear at least give yourself permission to do it, you know? And yeah, like, like, like it
882560	887760	would be, it's, it's weird. Like when you hear, when you hear those outtakes and you go on YouTube
887760	893200	and you type in like Thundercats, you know, and you hear, you hear the guy, the Thundercats guy
893200	899840	going thunder, thunder, thunder, oh fuck. It's so funny. And like that guy from America's Funniest
899840	904960	Videos, there's that, there's that reel of him going like coming up next and America's Funniest
904960	911920	shit can't fuck it. You know what, fuck this shit. Like, it's like, it's, I don't think there's
911920	921520	anybody out there that's actually like, like not incredibly profane. Yeah. It's really weird.
923280	928480	Television, this concept of standards and practices, it's like, well, I don't want my
928480	933360	kid to hear, actually, it's not weird at all. It makes perfect sense. It's the cleanest common
933360	937200	denominator. It's like, we all have to suffer because someone's eight year old kid might be
937200	942800	watching. Right. But that's it. I think eight is the age where I think at nine, you're saying
942800	949280	fuck so much already. Hearing other people say it, you're like, Oh, I'm normal. Because I remember
949280	952560	when I was nine, I would say fucking and feel horribly guilty because I hadn't really heard
952640	956560	that many people say it. But if my mom was also saying, fuck, I'd be like, all right,
956560	964880	this is fucking cool. You know, God, so much beef fungus growing in my, in my lungs,
964880	970560	my head's gonna come off and turn into a spider. Or maybe you get a superpower from this. Maybe
970560	979440	probably a 1% chance of that. Yeah. If, if Darwin's a bill feels really bad, Bill, it's not funny if
979440	985680	we eat the food and it's delicious. It's funny if there's fungus on it. And luckily that's what
985680	994880	happened. So you contributed to the well being of the show. He should definitely, he should forgive
994880	999040	himself. But at the same time, I mean, he went out on a limb. That's no, he totally did. Like
999040	1004640	everybody in the audience doesn't come with a bag full of perishable food. Almost nobody ever does.
1004640	1011200	Yeah. It's almost like there's a reason for it. There was a moment when all of them were going,
1011200	1015840	oh, should I be ashamed of myself because I didn't like get up this morning and go like,
1015840	1020320	what food am I going to bring to harm in town? Then you gave them the pleasure of going like,
1020320	1025920	oh good, there's boundaries for a reason. Yeah, you made them feel great.
1025920	1034640	They had a whole arc in like five minutes. I was like, I'm not that good. Oh no, I'm okay.
1035840	1040960	Bill sucks. You're awesome, Bill. He's a, he's a culinary Goldberg.
1045680	1048640	He's like Hulk, like everything I touch I crush in my hand.
1050400	1054320	I want to, okay. So, so speaking of speaking of what's right and what's wrong and where the
1054320	1058000	masses and how do you organize communities and let's go on the moon and then live it,
1058000	1065280	live them in peace. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, I want to, I want to bring our, uh, web, uh, uh, guru, uh,
1065280	1070400	sharoos out here. Wait, guru might be racist because he says it wasn't racist until you pointed
1070400	1081200	it out. If you just said web guru, if you said web fuck here, sure. Uh, the web mystic
1084320	1087600	guru, he's Indian.
1091920	1098000	You're right. Me pointing it out made it so racist. Uh, uh, uh, oh, you're not, wait, wait,
1098000	1103200	wait, what are, what are you, sharoos? Pakistani. Wait, you're Pakistani. Oh, you're okay. You guys
1103200	1107520	do that. I didn't know that. Do the handshake, do the handshake.
1107520	1120640	Whoa. They're just like us. Uh, so sharoos is our web genius. And I, I just found out,
1120640	1124160	by the way, I want to go on record. That means I'm the opposite of racist, right? Because I,
1124160	1133040	I like, I'm totally colorblind. Like, I don't know. Right. Yeah. Except you then caught yourself
1133040	1138560	and then you became slightly racist. I don't know. Listen, if I'm the guy who gets to say
1138560	1142480	people are racist or not, you're not racist, but I'm not that guy.
1151200	1159280	All right. Sharoos, regardless of his heritage, uh, uh, is a, uh, computer genius, uh, intimidatingly
1159280	1165920	so. And he does, he does a lot of, uh, pro bono, uh, uh, computer work and he did this thing for
1165920	1170400	Harmontown a long time ago that I'd never taken advantage of. And I keep reminding myself to try
1170400	1176240	it. It's like, anyways, I said to him, like, I want to be able to do this thing with the internet
1176240	1183280	and people's cell phones where, uh, cause I could say, for instance, I could go,
1183280	1190560	hey, who jerked off today by applause. And then like the people that Adam Goldberg
1191920	1198400	clapping to the surprise of no one, the people that applaud aren't, they may or may not be the,
1198400	1202800	all the people that jerked off. But what's, what's more obvious is that they're the people who
1202800	1208080	don't mind everyone knowing. And it's, it's too much like, there's too much, uh, Heisenberg
1208080	1212960	principle happening in that measurement, you know, like, and I, I, we have this, like, uh,
1212960	1217120	this, uh, you know, new technology available to us. Sometimes every once in a while you're kind
1217120	1222240	of curious, like, uh, okay, what percentage of you really feel this way or that way? And it was,
1222240	1226080	if there was like an anonymous way to very quickly do these polls. And I said that to
1226080	1232800	Charouse and he whipped up this thing that creates this geo fence around the room that we're in.
1232800	1235520	Whoa, really? That's amazing. I mean, not physically.
1235840	1243760	No, no, I'm not an idiot, Charouse. Sorry. I guess it's just not as amazing.
1243760	1248160	No, it is amazing because it's the things that are, uh, if the phones are within a certain
1248160	1254320	diameter, then, then they're in the set. That seems very, very impressive.
1256000	1261280	Okay. Thank you. So by the way, you are exactly, if my mom squints, when she looks at me,
1261280	1267120	she sees you. You are what my mom wanted me to be. Oh, I thought you were just being really
1267120	1276080	racist. No, no, no. In her dreams, I'm Charouse. That's what her plan for you was. Yeah. I study
1276080	1283680	computer science. Oh, Kumail, come to my bed. Okay. Let me Amanda. Go to computer camp.
1283680	1287680	Go to America. I like that the magical, mystical gesture she's making to
1289440	1305120	go to the United States and learn computers for my family. And then you came and look at you.
1305120	1309440	And yeah, I was like, fuck that. I like game of thrones.
1309440	1316240	But, uh, you were saying, and so you can do polls with this program?
1318000	1324480	Yeah. So the problem is that we have to think of something like, uh, you know, like, like, and get,
1324480	1329360	like, you can set up these things very easily. Like I did a test run of it and it's incredibly
1329360	1334560	easy, but I can't multitask. Like it's like, uh, what you, what we can do is we can think of any
1334720	1340480	kind of multiple choice question. Yeah. And then we can, he can punch it in and then we can give
1340480	1346320	them this URL that they can access on their phones and they can all go to it. Uh, and, uh,
1346320	1351200	and they can very easily vote. And there's like a time window. And after that time window, it'll
1351200	1356080	send all the results to email address that he specifies with like a pie chart and everything.
1356080	1361440	And oh, wow. Okay. How about let's do, do people think you've been racist tonight
1361680	1368880	and, or if you, there could be one where you're not racist, one where you don't want to be racist,
1368880	1372480	but Hey, we're all human. And then one that's like, yeah,
1374400	1378080	right. Specifically though, that I've been racist tonight. Yeah. What do you think? I mean,
1378080	1382560	I'm just spitballing. Well, I mean, the easy answer is yes, because the modern definition
1382560	1386720	of racism is acknowledgement of race. I mean, I just did, I just did your mom reaching out and
1387360	1394640	like she was some kind of gypsy from thinner. Yeah. I mean, yeah, I'm racist. We don't need
1394640	1399760	a poll for that. All right. All right. Fair enough. Yeah. The voice was, the voice was fun.
1401520	1404800	But what about the more, I mean, cause, cause real, the real definition of racism,
1404800	1408320	the reason we're obsessed with it is because it's an actual crap. Like the actual, like do,
1408320	1416640	am I actually racist? Yeah. Like, like, like do I, uh, uh, am I, uh, am I so obsessed with race
1416640	1423200	that I actually can't like, uh, like when you said web guru, a normal person would not have
1423200	1428800	thought it, but you're so, you think about that so much. I heard you made associated guru to Indian,
1428800	1436080	which he is not. It's in my defense. I'm a verbal thinker. So what I did, I said, I said, I said,
1436080	1441440	sharoos are web guru. And then I, and that's what tripped. I was like, sharoos are web guru.
1441440	1447040	And I went like, oops, that sounded bad to me. Yeah, sure. No, no, I understand. Okay. So do
1447040	1451920	you want that to be the question? Am I racist? Yeah. What do you think? Or we could do something
1451920	1456160	totally like, let's just take it for a test run. Yeah. That way. Cause if we sit here,
1456160	1461680	yeah, let's take that for a test run and then we can, so it just is Dan racist.
1461680	1469280	Well, yeah, is Dan racist is the question. And then, uh, let's, what are the possible
1469280	1476560	answers? Yes and no, obviously. And then what, uh, third, maybe, well, let's do more than maybe that
1476560	1485520	like he desperately doesn't want to be, but unintentionally he has some barriers. How much,
1485520	1490960	how many characters could, it's unlimited, but I just want to point out that, that Adam Goldberg
1490960	1499760	just texted me. Yes. Why do you have Goldberg's phone number? He doesn't have it. Adam Goldberg
1499760	1508400	has his, Adam Goldberg gets your phone number. Uh, I've been over this before. He has techniques.
1510880	1515920	Okay. So this is a drive. This is just a test run. Yeah. Just do the racist yes or no. Don't even
1515920	1521840	give them a third option. One minute time limit or, uh, you make it two. Okay. And what's the URL?
1521840	1530240	So it's a tent pole. T E N T P O L L dot it. So, so tent pole, but, but poll like a, like a,
1530240	1535680	like a Gallup poll, just even the play on dot it. This is the most clever thing I've ever come up
1535680	1541760	with in my life. I've just never done anything this good. Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot I T. Yeah.
1541760	1547520	Yeah. Yeah. So everybody just hit tap to find nearby polls. And then if it asks you for location
1547520	1553440	permission, hit yes. And then you just put your mailing address in there and you may receive some
1553440	1561600	uh, material about a timeshare. I want to tell you about, no, it's not working. It worked for me.
1564480	1569280	No, no, no, just do it. No, no, no guys, just do it. Did it ask you for permissions?
1569360	1571760	No. Yeah, it is. It's there.
1577680	1584720	It doesn't matter here. Take, take, take that lady's phone. This is like a nightmare for me right now.
1591120	1595600	Bill and Charooz both had their comeuppance for trying to be very nice.
1595760	1603920	Yeah. Charooz is a tentpole had E fungus on it. No, no, no, it worked for me.
1608800	1613040	You know, it's a good podcast when somebody on microphone says, I'm going to go into your
1613040	1625680	settings. Oh, okay. So the results are in. All right. Is Dan racist? Yes. 14 votes. No,
1625680	1632320	15 votes. Yeah. Let's just need more data. 20 votes. So you left the third one. Whoa,
1632320	1637440	that was a good number of people. Only the vocal minority from them. It made me made it seem like
1637440	1644400	it was not working. It turns out they're the vocal minority. Like fuck minorities. All right.
1644400	1655680	Can I, can I redo my answer? I don't think we need more data anymore. You got your data. That's your
1655680	1665600	reward for needing it. All right. Well, let's thank Charooz. Well, thank you. Charooz the snake
1665600	1678720	charming guru. That's India. He did generally float away on a fine carpet. Well, there's a place
1678720	1683600	in France or naked ladies dance. Yeah. That's the, that's the lyrics to that song. It's the
1683600	1689920	Egyptian national anthem actually. It's been the number one hit in Pakistan for 30 years. We have
1689920	1698560	pyramids and we used to have a Nile, but the snakes ate us and the sands been here a while.
1699760	1707200	Now we have a dictator. Nothing to sing about with that. That's how the song dies.
1708880	1713360	Human rights violations are real. What if you, what if you went to China and you went to a baseball
1713360	1717280	game and they were like, and you had never been to China and uh, and you're just at a baseball game
1717280	1721520	and uh, and they said, please rise for the national anthem. And you're, and you're like,
1721520	1731360	and he stood up and I went, the guy with the gong gets it started. You, you, you would be like the
1731360	1736560	only guy in all of China. What this racist and everyone would be like, what? This is the best
1736560	1741760	song. Why are you an asshole? This is the best song we've ever heard. You were telling me something
1741760	1747760	about Ironman and the Chinese. That's an interesting, somebody told me. Yeah. I saw it
1747760	1752160	somewhere, but I didn't read that Ironman three, but I believe that, I mean, it's, it's long, but
1752160	1757920	even when I moved to LA in the nineties, it was already the case that at least 60% of all these
1757920	1762400	big movies, their, their, their box office comes from overseas. I mean, we've long been living in
1762400	1769200	the age of, of, we think that we're like this, you know, uh, Monroe doctrine, like a culture,
1769200	1774240	like giving out entertainment to foreign markets. And, and, and, and in some respect,
1774240	1778640	that's true because they still just want to see Robert down a junior fryer fly around. Nobody's
1778640	1785920	watching Lollywood movies. That's the Pakistani film industry. But, but I mean, now China's
1785920	1790640	emerging as like this giant, giant, uh, market to the point where they, they remade Red Dawn and they
1790640	1794800	were originally, it was like the Chinese invaded America and then they had to go back in and they're
1794800	1800800	still like using computers to change everything to Korean. Uh, did you know about that? No. Wow.
1802080	1806400	Well, Red Dawn's out now. We can watch it now and like look at it. That's what happened. They,
1806400	1812000	that's why Red Dawn took so long. I heard that, uh, King Kong versus Godzilla had different endings
1812640	1818880	in Japan. Godzilla wins in here. Wait, I'm sorry. I thought you were doing a bit. No, I think that's
1818960	1824880	real. Do you mean the old school ones? Yeah, yeah. Wait, when Devlin bothered to make a thing. No,
1824880	1831840	no, no. Dean Devlin did not give a shit about, um, yeah. So I, what I heard is that Iron Man
1831840	1838960	three had like four minutes of Chinese extra Chinese bonus footage in it, where Tony Stark
1838960	1844080	says like, we got to warn the world about this threat. And then like there's a scene where he,
1844080	1849680	in the Chinese release where he goes to China and, and, and is like, and, and that's why we
1849680	1854880	got all band together against this octopus monster, whatever the thing is. And then, and then he's
1854880	1864640	like, I love China. And the article that was, that was printed about it was, uh, uh, had the,
1864640	1869280	had the angle that, uh, that the Chinese audiences had kind of rejected it critically. They didn't,
1869280	1874240	they were as into it as you would be if it was the other way around. Like if we loved Chinese
1874240	1879520	movies, which some of us do, but I mean, if China was just the place that made blockbuster movies
1879520	1884720	and shipped them over here and we went to see Iron Man three instead of like lead paint, if they
1884720	1891840	focused on movies, if they pause to say America rocks, like we would, whether we agreed or not,
1891840	1898080	we'd be like dumb. Yeah. Well, it's, uh, uh, Dr. Who, which I really, really love, uh, there's a
1898080	1903440	whole, now it's getting popular here. There's a season where they would shot some in America and
1903440	1909520	he's literally like a cowboy hat and stuff. And for me, even though I'm sort of an honorary American,
1909520	1915360	it really, really bugged me that they were clearly making such a transparent effort to like woo
1915360	1921600	American audiences. What? Uh, Dr. Who. Oh, he wears like a cowboy hat and he's in like Utah
1922480	1927280	and stuff. And it's exactly what you were saying. I think what people don't like about it is with the
1927280	1931200	comedian who's just talking about what they think they want to hear versus what they really want to
1931200	1935600	talk about. I think it's the exact same principle. Entertainment is voyeurism. I don't know why we
1935600	1940880	feel compelled to, I mean, for God's sakes, like we, I mean, like, and that's, that's the thing about
1940880	1945760	reference humor too. Like what you, I guess it makes sense that you remake the office and then
1945760	1951360	you're going to go through and you're going to change the references. Fine. But like we go too
1951360	1955520	far with it or we go like, Oh, no one wants to watch ugly people on TV. You know, it's like,
1955520	1960720	of course we do. Yeah. I mean, that's when I, we're ugly. Who else would we want to watch?
1960720	1968160	Most of us are ugly. Yeah. I, I've really gotten into these like European, uh, crime shows like
1968160	1972640	from Sweden and Denmark and stuff. And what's so weird about it, I was like, what's so different
1972640	1977440	because they're amazing shows, but also they'll have shows where nobody's attractive on the whole
1977440	1986080	show. Yeah. And then a lot of anal and way more in Swedish detective shows. Like it's, it's,
1986080	1992960	it gets a little weird because I would say most network TV almost no anal. Yeah. And then these
1992960	1998240	guys, that's a big difference. I mean, we're, we're really uptight about that. Yeah. Those guys,
1998240	2006240	assholes loose. Have you seen Swedish Colombo? That's crazy. Yeah. Like that whole, and you know,
2006240	2010880	Colombo was originally Swedish, right? It was an adaptation. Is that right? The original Swedish
2010880	2014960	Colombo, the reason why Peter Falk would, would, would, would pretend to start to leave and then
2014960	2020720	he'd come back. That was all originally like an anal sex then. Yeah. Cause he's like, Oh, I just,
2020720	2024880	just one more anal. That's what the original quote was. Yeah. He would pull it out. But I mean,
2024880	2028320	I was, I don't want to get graphic about it, but it was like, it became Americanized and it became
2028320	2032080	like, he's just in a raincoat and he's just leaving the scene and coming back in for another
2032080	2038800	question. But in the Swedish Colombo, it was Peter Fox was very, very anti that he always started
2038800	2044560	with selling out and he, he really was like, there should be the same amount of anal. Yeah.
2045200	2050560	And he got in a huge fight with John Landis about that. And who, and, and, and he, in the,
2050560	2055600	in the fist fight, that's how he lost an eye of Peter Falk. Yeah, that's true. And then John
2055600	2062000	Landis blew it. Go ahead. Sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead. Sorry. I start giving take, giving take.
2062000	2068000	No, no, John Landis actually went back on set and was like, fucking, I'm just going to do the
2068000	2074800	helicopter scene. And he was so, it's funny when you're sometimes like, you could just see what
2074800	2079840	the other person is thinking. Well, yeah, we connect the dots. John Landis is here tonight,
2079840	2085520	by the way, and happy that we're still connecting that dot. By the way, I know John Landis. I did a
2085520	2091840	episode of television with him. Yeah. What did you do? Franklin and Bash. Did he do an episode? I did
2091840	2097040	actually do Franklin and Bash and we shoot in Santa Clarita, which is about 30 miles north of,
2097040	2101840	it's just, you know, it's by like Six Flags, whatever. And there was one day where we were
2101840	2108240	shooting and he said, I swear he said, Charlie Chaplin shot modern times in Santa Clarita. Now
2108240	2113440	I'm shooting fucking Franklin and Bash. Wait, no, are you, are you joking? John Landis shot Franklin
2113440	2118720	and Bash and said that? Yeah. That's what he said. While it was a long day, three more hours.
2118720	2123120	Surrounded by people who are on team Franklin and Bash. Franklin and Bash were there.
2127280	2133920	And Franklin was like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because he's a dick, right? And Bash was like, fuck this
2133920	2141040	guy. Because Bash is like the John Lennon of Franklin and Bash. It was just such a weird moment
2141040	2147120	for everyone. Because even if there was also John Landis being like, I'm doing Franklin and Bash now.
2147120	2153120	And also just you look at like, you know, all the grand scheme of entertainment that people have
2153120	2161360	made. And, you know, it's just a weird. God damn it. There was a, never mind. What, what, what?
2161360	2166880	No, no, I can't. Yeah, no, it's not. And it's not, it's just, it's just caddy. Who cares? It's not,
2166880	2169920	I don't want to talk shit about people. Because like, like, like how many times have I had an
2169920	2173200	encounter with somebody and they're telling some story about like, I don't want to be represented
2173200	2178960	by some random encounter by a bathroom. Yeah. Everyone has a bad day. Yeah. Some people have
2178960	2184800	many. Harrison Ford fucking, like rape my mom. That's a bad day for two people.
2186000	2192640	Although your mom got a great story out of it. If I showed you like what my mom wears,
2192640	2201120	like on an average day. It just says fuck me Indiana on it. Harrison Ford. Like, like, like, yeah.
2201920	2211040	Get, get, get off of my plane and into my pussy. It says, it doesn't even make sense. I said, mom,
2211040	2215680	it doesn't make sense. Is it your plane or are you the president? And she, and she's like,
2215680	2221440	oh, should I make another shirt? And I'm like, stop it. Yeah. Talk to dad. He's like, you change
2221440	2228320	the locks. You don't communicate. And there's Netflix. Now you can watch more movies. Like,
2228320	2232560	you don't even know this person. Yeah. He's got a lot of movies. And if you ever run into him,
2232560	2237520	which she ended up doing, you're going to get raped. That's what I have for it. And the judge,
2237520	2242400	as he did, is going to let them go. Cause he's going to say, look what you were wearing. And
2242400	2245760	it's not going to be like a sexist thing. Cause what you were wearing as a sandwich board,
2245760	2251200	that's in place. You know, black people shouldn't be allowed to vote.
2253120	2256800	I just, if you see things in this voice and you don't open your mouth all the way,
2256960	2262800	I don't think women are inferior. That's, that's how I just, you know,
2262800	2266160	it's a sharoos comes out here. He's got a cold brew and a basket. He's fine with women.
2267920	2272960	He's riding a magic carpet around. This is okay. We might never take this out too.
2274880	2281040	Emily's mom. I feel like Emily's mom, if she doesn't know that 9 11 wasn't inside job.
2281200	2286720	But she like whispers three words. Like whenever she says them, she doesn't say
2286720	2292400	him out loud. Like she'll be like, the three words are like, he has cancer. She whispers cancer.
2292400	2296240	Oh, he has depression and the word Jewish.
2300880	2301920	All incurable.
2305760	2310560	She's just, she's not, she's not saying like they're bad people. She just knows that they
2310560	2315840	can't do, you know, nothing they can do about it. He's very nice. He's very nice. You know, very nice.
2318320	2323120	All right. Oh, God damn it. We got, okay. It's nine o'clock. So we're going to roll into
2323120	2333680	other duties. I know duties. The, Erin made a cake as usual. Does it have fungus on it?
2334960	2337920	She just baked it. There's no fungus. Why don't we give the,
2337920	2345920	should we give the cake to Bill? Because he, there you go, Bill.
2351440	2357520	It's a cake that says go marbles go. It's a, she made her her monkey in a frosting.
2359280	2363760	So that's your cake, Bill. It's our way. It's a teachable moment to you.
2364320	2370240	Like, this is how you give people food. You don't poison them. See how it has no fungus on it, Bill?
2371200	2376080	Maybe write that down. Just don't mail that cake to Texas
2377760	2381920	and say it's okay. Wrap it up in packing tape. Yeah, put it in a backpack.
2381920	2386800	Take it to the Yakov Smirnoff show and just give it to him. I'm assuming he's big in Austin.
2387840	2391840	Yakov, by the way, while we, I got really obsessed with Yakov. You know,
2391840	2397280	he has his whole therapy now. He does a, he has a, he's like a therapist now. And it's all,
2397280	2401520	it's called smile therapy or happy therapy or something, which is about willing yourself to
2401520	2411680	be happy. And that's what he does. He also, I can't imagine he'd be the one to come up with.
2416240	2419360	Sometimes you just gotta look at the world and flip it.
2419600	2426240	He also got like big into, he's like super patriot and he really got it in 9 11. And most people
2426240	2431680	don't know this. He had this banner. He's an artist. He makes paintings. He had this banner made
2431680	2437280	huge banner that hung from across ground zero. And it's like Statue of Liberty with like a heart
2437280	2445520	and stuff. And it's got some phrase on it that's like in Soviet Union. No, I wanted it to be in
2445520	2454960	Russia. 9 11 never forgets about you. But it's just something about like my heart is broken or
2454960	2464160	some stupid bullshit tendering thing. So wait, well, that's weird. Cause he, he's big in Branson,
2464160	2469440	Missouri, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a big pit. It's like a little middle America and kind of
2469440	2474880	like, like, it, it, it's a, and I always wondered like, well, is that just because what begets
2474880	2479920	what? What chicken laid, what egg? Maybe he's, maybe he's, his ideology is really actually,
2480800	2484400	I'm sure it is, but you convinced yourself. I always assumed that he was like this guy in
2484400	2489520	the eighties who was like, when we were fighting Russia, he was the step and fetch it of Russians.
2489520	2495120	You know, he would come out and go, I'm, I'm Russian, but I don't like it so much. You know,
2495120	2499600	and we would go, Oh, that makes us feel better about buying credit cards and shoes and stuff.
2499600	2503360	And, um, you don't buy credit cards. You buy them with a shoe. I don't want to get off.
2504240	2508560	But, but, but, and then I always assumed that because he was like an icon of for all I knew
2508560	2513360	he had like a, you know, he was, he didn't even have a Russian accent. Well, but, uh, I mean,
2513360	2518720	he is Russian and his story is really interesting, but Smirnoff is not his real name. And he did take
2518720	2523920	that because of the vodka where he was like, Oh, they'll like this. They'll like this vodka. They'll
2523920	2528720	associate. So he changed his name to Smirnoff. Yeah. And Yakov sounds like Jack off. I assume
2528720	2533680	there's a post-bake name. He's just fucking Jack off vodka guy. Wait, are you saying that
2533680	2538160	any part of that name is real? I think Yakov might be real. I'm not sure, but I know Smirnoff
2538160	2542960	is not. And he took it from the vodka. Again, what we thought the Chinese would like, he did to us
2542960	2548240	and it fucking worked. Interesting. And by interesting, I mean the opposite.
2548240	2553280	In America, interesting things bore you.
2559120	2563840	But I actually feel better thinking that he actually, oh yeah, he knew that he's a big
2563840	2570080	patriot because when I heard like, Oh, he's huge and Branson, I was, I, I, I, I assume every
2570080	2574080	entertainer is like a liberal and a, and a cosmopolitan, like, what was that? Like, like,
2574080	2580640	like, like not a red stator. No, some of the bad ones are red stators. I, I, I was, it's,
2580640	2584960	it comforts me to think that he's actually like, like the third act of his biopic is him and
2584960	2589520	Branson going like, this is why didn't they make this place sooner? Well, I mean, he's a god that
2589520	2594320	there's him. And there's another guy who I think is he's Asian, Japanese, or Chinese, something
2594320	2600000	who he, he makes like millions of dollars and he has this, his whole family. He's got a white wife
2600000	2604560	and they have a whole family where they like play the national anthem on violins and stuff like
2604560	2610320	that. Like, so it's sort of the place where other where immigrants go to like completely pander and
2610320	2618560	sell out. That's where I'll end up. It brings you back to a simpler time. Yeah. Where it was like
2618560	2623360	other countries were like, like, it was like going to the zoo. Yeah, exactly. Because you only saw
2623360	2627200	the one face. You're like, Oh yeah, lines are lazy. Look at that one's before they broke out and
2627520	2636960	fucking us. Yeah. Having all these weird babies, weird babies, weird beige, almond died, super
2636960	2645920	golfers. Everything, everything just, these, these colors don't run my ass. They ran together, brother.
2647760	2649760	In Russia, these runs don't color.
2652320	2656000	Seriously, folks, dig a hole in your backyard and get a wind up radio. It's, it's over.
2656800	2664400	And it's over because of races. Almond died super golfers is the name of this episode. Almond
2664400	2668880	died super golfers. All right. All right. Let's, let's, let's speed it along. Let's, let's get
2668880	2681840	Spencer out here and, uh, the, the, the
2681840	2693200	what up, what up, Spence? Not much, man. Nice comp trolling. Thank you. You're eating the
2693200	2699600	cookies. I want to try the cookies. I guess they are sealed. Yeah. These, these, oh, you think he's
2699600	2705440	just like a fungus guy who, who gifts people fungus. Well, I mean, poison me once. Right.
2705920	2714400	And you won't have to poison me twice. Poison me once. I mean, just for the listeners at home,
2714400	2718400	like the piece of one of our, one of our audience members held up a piece of beef
2718400	2723520	jerky as we all finished half eating the first bite. And there's so much mold on one of them,
2723520	2730240	mildew, whatever it is, it, it looks like a rabbit's foot. It has a coat of white,
2730240	2737120	beautiful fur. I feel like we should name it. That happens. This is good luck. It's,
2737120	2744160	it's such bad luck. I think it like had pulled, didn't participate in the poll. And then the one
2744160	2750800	I have has a little bit on it too. Yeah. That happens though. Like Kirkland signature brand,
2750800	2756880	teriyaki beef jerky will also, uh, uh, you know, manifest that on occasion. I'd say one in every
2756880	2764960	six bags, one in every six. Yeah. I can't, in my experience, this is a, that's a terrible ratio.
2764960	2772000	Yeah. Kirkland signature. One in every six. We'll talk back to you.
2773040	2777680	Do you want to try this? Dan, these are the, um, raw, I can't look carbs. Let's double kill you.
2781840	2783520	I'll stick to the hairy meat.
2787680	2791200	It looks like somebody dipped all of these in cotton candy. That's how much
2794000	2799120	it looks like the, uh, the gold bloom body snatchers movie. Oh yeah. The seventies body
2799120	2806160	snatchers. Yeah. Yeah. They were the little tendrils. Uh, all right. Let's air McGathey.
2806160	2817600	Can you come out? Hey, Bill, I think it's real sweet that you brought that.
2817600	2822640	Of course it's sweet. And it's not, it's not his fault that one bag was. Honey, I'm sorry.
2822640	2827520	That sounded so condescending. Honey, we would talk about it. Listen, honey, I would have said
2827520	2832080	that to a guy too, but this is a different, this was a different, two different bags. But I'm
2832080	2837840	guessing that the, the company that he got that from, it's, it's like, it's a real family, uh,
2837840	2843360	organization. And sometimes things slip through the cracks. I'm going to eat all the rest of it.
2843360	2848160	Well, the other, the other end of the spectrum is that photo that was circulating on the internet
2848160	2855760	where the guy found a, uh, a 1989 McDonald's cheeseburger in his coat pocket, uh, and it
2855760	2863440	looked like just like it does on the menu. And it's supposed to go bad. This is what's supposed
2863440	2867680	to happen to food. If it has life in it. Yeah. The other life is supposed to want to eat it.
2869120	2874960	I mean, even if it was all covered in mold, the sentiment is still really, no, Bill, Bill. No,
2874960	2881680	really. I'm the person who brings unsolicited cakes. Yeah. It's totally, totally A for effort,
2881760	2890560	F for fungus. I think we, I think we were very, I think we went very easy out of.
2892400	2897520	And Bill, I hope you don't mind me outing you. Bill was tearing up as we were sitting and
2897520	2902080	Dustin and I were watching him. You weren't tearing up, were you, Bill? Were you really
2902080	2908000	tearing up? Oh, Bill, this is wonderful. You've made the podcast better.
2908320	2916720	You made the podcast. If, if he, if he brought food to actually provide sustenance and joy for
2916720	2920640	other people, then it would, it would, it would be fair to assume his worst nightmare would be
2920640	2926160	that it was in fact disgusting. And I totally relate to that. That that would make me tear up.
2926160	2930720	Especially if it was something that you really love this specific beef jerky that you had
2930720	2935520	shipped in. But I mean, I feel, I mean, it's, it all comes out in the wash. It's all karmically
2935520	2941040	balanced because that's, I mean, but everything's fine. Yeah, it's awesome because we've been
2941040	2946880	talking about it. We're all, yay. Yeah, we've all been talking about this jerky and it's been
2946880	2953360	awesome. The jerky could not have tasted as good as making fun about it feels.
2955920	2959280	And also, as I've said before, when I was on the playground and people would pick on me,
2959280	2963360	I would never cry. Like no matter how hard anyone hit me, no matter how many showers they tell me
2963360	2970640	to take. The thing that would make me burst into tears was the fucking good natured guy coming up
2970640	2975360	and going, come on, leave him alone. Maybe he doesn't want to take showers. And then I'd be like,
2978000	2983440	kill myself. Well, I didn't come up and say like, Hey man, maybe he likes fungus.
2984160	2988640	Maybe he wanted everyone to eat some fungus. That's not what I said. I wasn't, I wasn't,
2988640	2991200	maybe someone, someone stick up for Aaron. I'm attacking her too much.
2994240	2999440	How you doing? I'm all right. All right. I didn't know what I thought was going to happen.
3000800	3009280	Bill's awesome. Whatever. We're all, it was great. He's going to go home tonight. Open a window to
3009280	3016960	a snowy front yard, put a puck crown on a crown of twigs and then go into his father's den.
3017440	3021840	We watched that right before we came here. Or he could just eat one of his turkeys.
3025760	3029840	Bill, you're not allowed to cry another tear until someone dies.
3030880	3035760	Bill, we're all okay. And your gesture was absolutely wonderful. Also, I don't know.
3035760	3038960	I don't know if I washed my hands when I made that cake. Who knows?
3041360	3044640	He saved the last bag for himself, he said. That's fine.
3044640	3047120	Bill, our job is to make sure you do not eat it.
3049920	3053600	I don't know why they're so crazy about guns in Texas. I mean, when one piece of meat could like
3053600	3060560	take out a whole audience. Jesus, we can still defend ourselves against the enemy, obviously.
3061920	3064080	You don't need background checks for this jerky.
3065120	3069440	If anyone can take anything away from this podcast, never put yourself out there. Never.
3070320	3072800	Never be generous. Never put yourself out there.
3072800	3077520	I think the message is don't push yourself out there if you have fungus goods.
3079440	3082320	I mean, meat is a real limb.
3084160	3085280	It's an actual limb.
3085280	3085760	Of course.
3090480	3091760	We're not bullying Bill.
3091760	3097120	No, we're off to the side. We think it's wonderful that he did this. It's wonderful.
3097920	3102000	This is a stage full of people who are very bullied who are trying to un-bully.
3102000	3104640	Yeah, it's like, well, I was grapple with that stuff.
3106960	3111280	When you say don't put yourself out there sarcastically, I feel very strongly about
3111280	3114800	that. Whenever people come up and talk and share things and stuff, I always want to make sure that
3114800	3121680	we don't do the Jay Leno-y kind of like, oh, well, someone's talking. So if they use a T instead of
3121680	3126320	an S, we're going to fucking throw a parade for the letter T. I mean, I know we're jumping on
3126320	3132080	the fucking fungus on the beef, but there's another rule of entertainment and conversation,
3132080	3140080	which is go where the heat is. I mean, we all know that Bill didn't make fungus grow.
3140080	3140960	He's not God.
3142640	3144880	We're not going to talk about it any sport. I mean, more.
3148960	3152000	Oh, man. I'm so happy you talked about the Christian Bale.
3153440	3154880	This jerky is growing on me.
3157280	3158080	Cool, man.
3159360	3165360	I genuinely, Bill, nothing but love. This is awesome. Genuinely, I think this is great.
3165360	3168880	How much less interesting would it have been if this was just like really good jerky?
3168880	3171120	I think it's awesome that it has fungus in it.
3171680	3176880	The real villain is this man who presented the moldy jerky.
3176880	3178080	I'm just kidding, Ray. Please don't do that.
3178080	3178640	No, come on.
3178640	3179440	I'm just kidding.
3180720	3183520	That took guts. His car is going to explode in the parking lot.
3183520	3185280	It's not bad, literally.
3186000	3188480	He's the whistleblower. It takes balls.
3190000	3192960	He was in a room full of pleasure and he had to hold up a rabbit's foot and go,
3192960	3200400	well, just so you know, this one's reproductively viable, which is why you can see the white.
3203440	3206000	Which in France would probably cost a million dollars.
3208000	3210960	Hey, the fungus was inside us the whole time.
3210960	3212400	All right, let's start playing.
3212400	3214320	I wasn't able to be here a couple of weeks ago.
3214320	3214880	Yeah.
3214880	3216640	And Duncan Trussell played my character.
3218160	3224640	And I, on purpose, did not catch myself up on what happened to Christopher.
3226240	3230800	So I don't know. I basically blacked out for Christopher, blacked out for a week.
3230800	3233760	And now I want to find out what what happened.
3234640	3237120	That makes sense. I mean, that's that's natural.
3237920	3239600	All right. So should we do the music?
3239600	3241600	We need somebody to play Jeff's character. Should we have?
3242240	3242880	Yeah, I don't want to.
3242880	3245520	Bill, you want to play Jeff's character? Bill.
3250320	3251520	Bill is playing Jeff's character.
3251520	3252080	Give it a shot.
3252080	3252960	Do I have a character sheet?
3253760	3255120	Yeah, you want to pass these out.
3255120	3259840	Is this the D&D music that's happening on the previous episode?
3260400	3263200	Our heroes. This is too moody.
3263200	3267040	We're still lost shadow plane after killing breathy.
3267040	3271520	This is Dustin Marshall on is this on DJ.
3272160	3273120	That's cool.
3273120	3276640	Broughy, the spidery desert denizen of the dark to the north.
3276640	3280000	Behind the dark pillars stood an imposing and flickering fence.
3280000	3283840	And to the south, the sound of beating hooves was once again audible.
3283840	3288400	Swiftly following the sound of hooves was none other than Tylenol with codeine, the unicorn.
3289120	3291360	And with him, terrible news.
3291360	3296560	Tylenol's force had been raised to the ground by deviant creatures from another dimension.
3296560	3301200	As it dawned on Sharpie that his errant fireballs may have designated the commie forest.
3301200	3305360	He was quick to admit his error and codeine quicker to forgive the transgression.
3306320	3310560	At the same time, Krista Berg, who had been feeling out of sorts after the last
3310560	3315520	combat spoke nonsense and carved strange prophecies into his own arm.
3316640	3321040	And requested he be impaled upon Tylenol with codeine's one horn.
3321920	3325840	Confused and likely disturbed by the sudden masochistic bend,
3325840	3328800	the party investigated the gate and set off a trap.
3328800	3331680	Chris and Quark were pinned by shadowy bindings.
3331680	3336560	Sharpie leapt over a massive shadow gate and deactivated the trap, freeing his friends.
3336560	3338400	But the victory was short lived.
3338400	3342560	A party of shadows with bladed limbs poured from the darkness behind the gate.
3342560	3344320	And a great combat ensued.
3345280	3347040	So, so great.
3348880	3353040	Our heroes managed to cut down two of the foes, but four remain.
3353920	3355840	Oh wait, we stabbed right in the middle of the fight.
3355840	3357840	Yeah, it was a pretty intense fight.
3357840	3361120	Wasn't there a moment, well maybe this was just facetious and didn't actually happen,
3361120	3366080	but where Krista Berg, Jeff and Krista Berg were fucking and I was jerking off on them and rapping.
3366080	3368400	But that was probably just to end the show.
3369360	3369840	Okay, yeah.
3369840	3370960	Is that canon?
3373600	3376720	I had to ask myself that as I reviewed the episode.
3376720	3380000	And it wasn't canon specifically because...
3380000	3381600	If we did that, we'd all be dead.
3382160	3385280	Yeah, because you stopped time to go into rap,
3385280	3388480	which halted combat time and either your heads would all have been
3389360	3392720	sliced to pieces in the ensuing dance number or it didn't happen.
3394560	3396400	Okay, I have a couple questions.
3396400	3396880	Sure.
3398800	3401440	You feel a pain in your stomach, in your right arm.
3402800	3405920	Okay, my first question.
3406640	3410880	When you say impaled on the unicorn, what does that mean?
3411440	3411920	Sexual.
3411920	3412560	What did I do?
3413520	3416080	No, no, yeah, so okay.
3416080	3417040	So at some point-
3417040	3418240	Oh guys, I just came too.
3419280	3420640	What's this with the unicorn?
3420640	3426880	You look down at your arm and still bleeding on your flesh is scrawled the scars of your dagger.
3427520	3432560	They say, how can you have a video game podcast and not play Starcraft 2?
3436160	3437440	These words are meaningless.
3439200	3439520	Yeah.
3440720	3441680	Heebie jeebies stuff.
3441680	3443040	Also, you had sex with Quark.
3444080	3444960	That didn't happen though.
3444960	3445680	That didn't happen?
3445680	3445920	No.
3445920	3447680	What about the unicorn? What did I do?
3448560	3452640	You cut it into your arm and then you invited the unicorn to stab you with his horn,
3452640	3456720	which he did with great vigor and dealt to you about 11 damage, I believe.
3458400	3459120	What the fuck?
3461680	3465600	You should be lucky to cut off his fingers because he was gunning for that for a while.
3465600	3466800	I gave him a healing potion.
3466800	3467520	His mom died.
3467520	3468000	All right, yeah.
3468000	3469040	Duncan's mom died.
3469040	3470240	Quark handed you a potion.
3471920	3473280	Oh my God.
3473280	3474480	She did you really?
3474480	3475040	Yeah.
3475040	3475440	Yeah.
3475440	3476480	You didn't know that?
3476480	3476880	No.
3476880	3477360	I don't know why.
3479120	3479680	I don't know.
3479680	3481840	You sounded like you got a new surfboard or something.
3482640	3484160	I don't know why I assumed you knew Duncan.
3484160	3491360	What sucks now is that I'm the asshole for being upset that he would act out.
3491360	3494000	I mean, I don't know what I would do if my mom passed away.
3494000	3497920	I would probably have Duncan's character impaled by the unicorn.
3498800	3500160	Seems like one thing's for sure.
3501440	3506160	We should fight these shadow monsters and kill them and then we gotta fuck Jeff.
3506160	3507040	Let's go.
3507040	3508240	Oh, yes.
3508240	3508720	Sorry, Belle.
3512080	3513040	Belle, I know that we apologize.
3513040	3514480	Because he's fucked everything.
3516240	3517600	Marbles around.
3518320	3520320	And did he have sex with marbles already?
3520320	3521280	No, that never happened.
3521280	3521520	All right.
3521520	3525440	Well, let's kill these shadow creatures and then we'll all run a train on Jeff.
3525440	3527440	All right.
3527440	3529760	I'm gonna put it at the shadow creatures turn.
3529760	3530720	There's four of them left.
3530720	3533520	Two of them were cut down, I believe, by the blade of quark.
3533520	3538160	So one of them is actually trying to strangle quark with like his limb
3538160	3541280	is this smoky gas that's choking him down.
3541280	3542400	That's you, Belle.
3542400	3542880	Yeah.
3542880	3543440	You're quark.
3543440	3544160	You're quark.
3545200	3546080	All right.
3546080	3550000	The rest of the shadows rear back and their limbs turn into smoke
3550000	3553280	and they flow towards you with an amazing speed.
3553280	3555920	You can try to dodge, but you fail miserably.
3557520	3558720	That is two of you do.
3558720	3563040	However, Krista Berg manages to jump out of the way of the incoming smoke.
3563040	3565760	The rest of you, you feel the smoke, it hits you right in the face
3565760	3567760	and it's all black and you can't see for a moment.
3567760	3570160	And then it forces itself down your throat
3570160	3572400	and you feel yourself coughing and choking on smoke
3572400	3574560	because you're in a terrible fire.
3576160	3576960	No damage, though.
3578240	3579840	But I'm going to use my talking dagger
3579840	3581840	and try to cut one of the tentacles for my neck.
3581840	3582400	Oh, yeah.
3582400	3583280	So this is smoke.
3583280	3584160	It's not tentacles.
3584160	3586000	So I'm still going to try to cut at it.
3586000	3586720	Okay, go for it.
3589520	3589840	All right.
3589840	3591600	You successfully strike the smoke.
3591600	3596240	However, it being smoke, it is instantly parted and reformed.
3596240	3600000	I feel like it gave you a clue that that was not going to work.
3601360	3602000	It's a talking.
3602000	3603600	That's what his character would do.
3603600	3604080	Probably.
3605280	3606320	I cough.
3607200	3608240	Yeah, you do.
3608240	3608960	That's a given.
3609920	3613280	Do you want to try and expel this from your lungs?
3613280	3613600	Yes.
3613600	3613920	Okay.
3613920	3614240	Yeah, yeah.
3614240	3614960	That makes sense.
3614960	3618480	Yeah, I cough and I run backwards really quickly.
3618480	3621200	Attempting to both evade and void your lungs
3621200	3622720	of the terrible gas within.
3623680	3625520	You manage to choke back a bit.
3625520	3626800	You're gaining a bit of breath.
3626800	3628400	Your head grows a bit clearer.
3629040	3632320	But still trying to invade.
3632320	3632800	Choke ya.
3634960	3636560	It says here I have smoke bombs.
3636560	3638640	Does that mean bombs that would hurt smoke?
3639920	3642320	They only blow up smoke.
3642320	3644800	No, for like diversions and whatnot.
3645680	3647600	Maybe a dance party would start or something.
3647600	3647760	Yeah.
3649520	3652160	I can't open notice on my character sheet
3652160	3656480	because over the weeks these things get soaked with wine and vodka
3656480	3659840	and you've had to create crisp character sheets.
3659840	3661840	And each time you do like an English teacher,
3661840	3665600	you kind of like circle things and put exclamation points and like,
3665600	3666400	Oh, yeah.
3666400	3669200	Well, I mean, I circled the soul of growth
3669200	3671200	because that's the most powerful artifact
3671200	3673200	that you guys have encountered so far.
3673200	3676800	And I circled your temporary stats
3676800	3678560	because you lost strength and constitution
3678560	3680000	when your shadows ran away.
3680000	3681280	I thought that was relevant.
3681280	3683760	But you're letting me know that the soul of growth is important here.
3683760	3684720	No, it's not.
3684720	3687520	I will let you know it's not important in the circumstance.
3687520	3689920	I just circled it because it's literally the most powerful object
3689920	3690960	you guys have encountered so far.
3693360	3693920	Sharpie?
3693920	3694800	Yes.
3694800	3695600	I think it's your turn.
3695600	3696560	I'll walk that back.
3696560	3697360	It might be useful.
3698880	3699680	Is it my turn?
3699680	3700180	Yeah.
3701840	3702880	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3702880	3707600	And as I recall, I was limited to level one and two spells.
3707600	3710720	Yeah, you're still on a three, level three ones.
3710720	3712720	Level three ones I can still cast?
3712720	3713440	No, you're out of them.
3713440	3713920	I'm sorry.
3713920	3714720	Out of them, okay.
3715360	3715760	All right.
3715760	3717120	I should eat more often.
3718400	3719280	Me too, brother.
3719280	3721280	Well, Goldberg brought you some chips.
3721280	3722560	Yeah, and a Milky Way.
3722560	3725600	Yeah, but by the time I start eating that, it'll be done.
3726320	3729600	And then who knows how long it'll take for the nutrients to absorb.
3729600	3730240	There's pain.
3730880	3733680	If you eat, you feel not hungry right away.
3735520	3736020	Yeah.
3737360	3738640	Pretty much how food works.
3740480	3745040	I will categorically deny that there is a time that it takes
3745040	3747840	for your brain to register that you're full and satiate.
3747840	3748560	But you're full.
3748560	3750800	But if you're thirsty, you drink water.
3750800	3752240	You're great immediately.
3752240	3752960	Yeah, yeah, sure.
3753600	3754800	Yeah, for thirst, definitely.
3755760	3757760	I feel like it's the same principle, but...
3757760	3759120	It's really not.
3759120	3762320	You do you, Spencer.
3762320	3762960	I do me.
3763680	3764400	All right, fuck it.
3764400	3765200	Scorching Ray.
3765200	3767360	I mean, I don't have anything clever to do.
3767360	3769440	Waving your hands in a magical manner,
3769440	3772720	you fire off a couple bolts of fire towards the shadow.
3772720	3773840	Prestidigitum scorchum!
3776160	3781600	It strikes one directly in the right arm, the right blade arm.
3782240	3782800	Oh, nice.
3783840	3784480	That happens.
3784480	3786080	That's not really relevant.
3786080	3787360	But dealing...
3788960	3790080	Everybody shut up.
3791120	3792000	12 damage.
3793760	3795600	You know, we weren't saying anything.
3795600	3796080	I know.
3797520	3799200	That was the joke.
3799200	3800720	God needs a snack.
3802560	3804000	Master need to snack.
3804000	3807040	Somebody got a bag of animal crackers?
3807040	3808880	Dealing 12 damage.
3808880	3811040	It staggers back a couple of steps,
3811040	3814000	and you can see his smoky arm kind of flutter a bit,
3814000	3815600	when he keeps on keeping on.
3816800	3817120	Okay.
3818560	3819680	I haven't done anything yet.
3819680	3820320	Yeah, that's true.
3820320	3822800	He asked a question, but he hasn't actually taken an action.
3822800	3823840	Can I use acid?
3823840	3824480	Will that help?
3826080	3827520	I have vials of acid.
3827520	3829680	So, yeah, if you pour that on something,
3829680	3832400	it could like burn away at it and potentially cause damage.
3833520	3833920	All right.
3833920	3836640	Well, I sort of take a vial of acid,
3836640	3843120	and I throw it at one of the guys that he hit.
3843120	3846000	That's a strategic move, definitely.
3846000	3847200	Yeah, you strike him.
3847840	3850240	Rearing back, you whip your hand forward
3850240	3853280	and fling the half-open vial of acid.
3853280	3855680	It smacks the guy directly in the face
3855680	3857760	and shatters on impact,
3857760	3860000	and you see caustic green liquid fizzle
3860000	3864080	and burn on the being surface dealing four damage.
3864960	3866400	That's very anything.
3867200	3870320	You know, Bill got lampooned for attacking it with a knife.
3870320	3872880	What's more logical about attacking smoke with an acid?
3872880	3875360	Well, but he attacked just the smoke.
3875360	3877200	I threw it at the source of the smoke,
3877200	3880080	which is some sort of physical being.
3880080	3881600	Oh, we just found out I'm not listening.
3883360	3884400	There's a physical being?
3885600	3887280	I thought there was shadow dudes.
3887280	3888240	Whose turn is up?
3888240	3890960	I mean, it's the shadow monster's turns, yeah.
3891920	3896720	So you can feel this choking kind of gaining a hold over you.
3897920	3899520	Your limbs are getting kind of numb
3899520	3901360	and your mind's going a bit dim
3901360	3903680	like you might lose consciousness pretty soon.
3903680	3905200	I would say that's the three of you,
3905200	3907920	and again, not you, because you dodged, yeah.
3907920	3908400	Okay.
3908400	3910000	However, two of the guys,
3910000	3912800	seeing that you haven't been affected by this,
3912800	3915920	charge towards you and slice at you with their bladed limbs.
3915920	3917440	I use my uncanny dodge.
3918080	3919680	You might think that.
3921200	3925200	Uncannily, you manage to dodge one of the blows,
3925200	3928000	but the other strikes you directly in the right thigh,
3929360	3932560	specifically, dealing seven damage.
3932560	3934480	Okay, we're getting fucked up.
3934480	3936480	Yeah, putting it at Quark's turn.
3937120	3939520	Guys, I don't know what to do.
3939520	3940880	How do we kill these guys?
3940880	3943920	Sometimes the game's a lot more simpler.
3943920	3945760	You just do the same thing over and over.
3945760	3949760	Am I in a position where I can try to cleave with Far Sword?
3949760	3950560	Yeah, definitely.
3951440	3952480	The Far Sword's used up.
3952480	3953600	You can cleave, though.
3953600	3954880	All right, try to cleave.
3954880	3955360	Definitely.
3956080	3957920	Yeah, go for it.
3957920	3958800	Yeah, go for it.
3961520	3962880	Yeah, that's not bad.
3962880	3963680	Okay, yeah.
3965280	3966480	Whipping out your sword,
3966480	3970400	you slice directly through the damaged shadow creature,
3970400	3971680	and you manage to deal...
3972960	3974480	Oh, wow, that's pretty good.
3974480	3977760	14 damage, felling the guy in a single strike.
3977840	3980560	Yeah, your sword carries through
3980560	3983040	and hits the next guy directly in his...
3983040	3984880	Where it would be a rib on a normal person,
3984880	3986080	but he's a shadow guy.
3988240	3990240	Dealing a further 17 damage.
3990240	3990720	Yeah!
3995680	3998240	But, but, he brought bad meat.
4000320	4001840	Temper your applause.
4003440	4006000	In real life, he is killing us slowly.
4006960	4009280	He has dealt a 17 damage.
4011680	4014240	And this fortitude saves not optional.
4015760	4016960	Was that a smoked rib?
4017680	4018320	What? Yeah.
4018960	4020080	All right, yeah!
4021120	4022160	Wait, I didn't get...
4025280	4026240	All right, so that was good.
4026240	4027600	So now there's three left.
4027600	4028640	Yeah, so there's three left,
4028640	4030400	putting it at Moraine's turn.
4030400	4032800	Okay, so they're shadows,
4032800	4034160	but they're also smoke,
4034160	4036000	and the shadows are going into our throats,
4036000	4037760	but we can sometimes cut them with swords
4037760	4039040	and sometimes not.
4039040	4041600	You can cut smoke with a sword,
4042320	4044480	but it doesn't have any effect on the smoke.
4046080	4047040	That's what happened.
4047040	4048480	They are physical beings
4048480	4051120	whose limbs are transmuting to smoke
4051120	4052000	or some sort of gash.
4052000	4053200	So go for the swords, I would say.
4053200	4055440	I can either treat the swords with a symptom.
4055440	4055920	All right.
4058720	4061520	I take out three arrows.
4064560	4069920	One, two, three arrows.
4072240	4073520	You tie them to your feet.
4075840	4077920	And I take a nap.
4080640	4083840	Is it possible to fire three arrows
4083840	4087280	while also guzzling some water?
4088240	4088480	No.
4090240	4091360	You can guzzle some water
4091360	4092640	and then fire three arrows.
4092640	4093200	Oh, okay.
4093200	4093840	No, wait, you can't.
4094320	4095280	Don't go for the water.
4095280	4096960	Just do the arrows, I would say.
4096960	4097680	Either way.
4097680	4098640	Well, because it's smoke.
4099360	4100640	Dan's looking at me confusedly.
4101280	4101760	Smoke.
4101760	4103040	Smoke makes you thirsty?
4103040	4106560	Well, I mean, I would try to push out the smoke
4106560	4107440	with fire.
4107440	4110000	I can't put fire with water.
4110000	4111120	I can't put fire in my throat.
4111120	4112560	Or just choking water immediately.
4112560	4114640	I'm killing the guy in the front row, apparently.
4116320	4117280	I'm not going to trust you.
4117280	4118880	You chose to wear that shirt tonight.
4120880	4122160	Oh, that's a joke.
4123920	4125200	Where are the mean ones?
4125200	4126960	It's a fine shirt.
4126960	4128880	It's a very specific color.
4128880	4130160	God damn it, guys.
4130160	4131200	I didn't mean it.
4131200	4132320	I didn't mean it.
4132320	4134960	Just as long as we don't punish anyone
4134960	4136240	for putting themselves out there.
4139200	4142960	Let's just fucking seek and destroy anyone
4142960	4144400	who wore a shirt tonight.
4146400	4147200	Hey, nice head.
4147200	4148880	Would your mom fuck up?
4150720	4152240	Yeah, who'd your mom fuck?
4152240	4153200	General Ugly?
4154800	4155680	I'm defensive.
4155680	4158240	Hey, how do you know when you're finished with your face?
4160000	4161840	There's something gross growing on your neck.
4161840	4162480	Oh, sorry.
4162480	4163520	It's your face.
4163520	4166240	In my defense, I was saying what I wanted to do.
4166240	4168400	And he was acting like I was killing him
4168400	4170640	by throwing his arms up in the air and being really upset.
4170640	4171520	So it was a little defensive.
4171520	4173520	Well, shoot your three arrows, right?
4173520	4174400	That's what we're doing?
4174400	4175840	Back to the ending.
4175840	4177200	I'm assuming that's what happened.
4177200	4178560	And I already rolled the dice.
4180160	4181200	But really, your shirt's fine.
4181200	4181680	I'm sorry.
4181680	4182720	He's not even looking at me in here.
4182720	4184080	We have to let it go.
4184080	4184720	I'll let it go.
4184720	4185280	I'll let it go.
4185280	4186560	I was trying to be in the front.
4186560	4187040	Let it go!
4189600	4191200	Two of the arrows miss their mark,
4191200	4194960	but one plants itself directly into the right.
4194960	4196160	No, left hand.
4196160	4197760	She makes fun of his shirt.
4197760	4199040	Of the smoke monster.
4199680	4200880	I'm so sorry.
4200880	4202480	Dealing six damage.
4202480	4203680	Six damage, all right?
4203680	4204400	Six damage.
4204400	4205440	Who cares anymore?
4206560	4207280	Are you OK?
4210800	4211680	Do you want some cake?
4212800	4213680	Are you going to be here next week?
4213680	4214800	You gave me the cake.
4214800	4215200	I did.
4215200	4216160	No, you gave me the cake!
4217760	4218720	Oh my god.
4218720	4219520	You can have some cake.
4219520	4220640	Will you be here next week?
4220640	4222320	Dude, you can have some cake.
4222320	4223120	What's your favorite part of the world?
4223120	4224640	You should give him to the starving guy.
4224640	4225760	I don't want a cake, boys.
4230480	4231600	All right.
4231600	4231600	
4232880	4233840	Aaron, are you saying he looks like he likes him some cake?
4233840	4235920	This is why we should have left him.
4235920	4237040	Yeah, Sharpie, let's go.
4238640	4241280	I can't wait to have half self-conscious children with you.
4243360	4243840	Half?
4244400	4244960	I know.
4244960	4245680	That's the joke.
4247360	4248320	They don't have a chance.
4251280	4254560	They're going to come out of your uterus and go like, what am I?
4256560	4257520	Did I do it wrong?
4257520	4260400	And they're just going to hang themselves with their umbilical cord.
4260400	4261440	I'm so sorry I cried.
4261440	4262160	I'm so sorry I cried.
4262800	4264160	I know this is where I'm supposed to be.
4264160	4265920	And I cried, and I'm so sorry.
4265920	4267280	Was the pregnancy OK?
4267280	4268560	Were you bleeding irregularly?
4270080	4271680	Hey, there's a pussy behind me.
4271680	4272160	Just kidding.
4272800	4273280	Is that a bad joke?
4273280	4273520	I don't know.
4276400	4277040	I'm so fat.
4281600	4283680	Take a look at this pussy behind me.
4286640	4289200	I'm going to get Aaron pregnant, and in the delivery room,
4289200	4292880	the kid's going to shoot out of her vagina and start googling itself.
4295200	4297840	And then apologize for it for the rest of its life.
4299760	4301840	Apologize for it, and then ask if it's OK.
4302160	4304160	And then apologize for it again.
4304160	4305120	Sharpie, it's your turn.
4306000	4307760	I hold up the soul of growth.
4311520	4314080	And I go, brr-k-a-ch-a-g-d-y.
4315120	4318880	Holding the soul of growth aloft, it is caught with the azure light
4318880	4322560	that shifts into a more emeraldish, greenish, yellowish light.
4323680	4327200	Shadows, I know you.
4327200	4332800	For a second, you can see what actually looks like light
4332800	4334960	for the first time in the shadow plane,
4334960	4337200	and the rays are cast upon your body,
4337200	4341360	and you feel yourselves becoming stronger and more able to carry on.
4342400	4349760	You all gain 16 health points of health right back to your life totals.
4349760	4350240	Yeah!
4354720	4356480	That's why I said maybe relevant.
4358080	4360400	All right, so is it me now?
4360400	4362400	That would be smoke monster's turn.
4363680	4364960	There's three of them left, right?
4365840	4366880	Nope, just two.
4368800	4369760	That's true, yeah.
4370720	4372160	Yeah, there's two of them left.
4376480	4377520	You can trick God.
4377520	4378560	I know there's three.
4381680	4385280	I rolled three attacks, so I mean, they're happening.
4385280	4385520	OK.
4387360	4391680	All right, so Sharpie, that last expulsion of air
4391680	4393680	kind of took the last of your air,
4393680	4396960	and the rest of the smoke kind of invades your lungs.
4396960	4398640	You're really on the ropes.
4398640	4400720	You think you might have a couple more breaths
4400720	4404480	before you lose consciousness, just from this breathing sort of thing?
4404480	4410240	Mulrain, in fact, does lose consciousness, so only Kumail and...
4410240	4411040	Who's Kumail?
4412560	4413840	Experience points.
4415760	4416800	So I'm OK?
4417280	4419680	Yeah, Krista Berg is not affected by the smoke.
4419680	4422720	Quark has actually managed to cough some of the smoke out
4422720	4424640	and is shaking it off for the most part.
4425360	4426240	OK.
4426240	4427680	So it's just me and you, but...
4427680	4429760	Well, he's still barely conscious.
4429760	4430400	OK.
4430400	4430960	Sorry, Mulrain.
4430960	4435040	That is my last puff to say something cute and Pixar-ish, like...
4436400	4436960	Little help!
4444400	4444960	All right.
4445280	4447600	Something that kids can giggle at, but parents can be like...
4447600	4448240	This is edgy.
4451680	4452640	Get jiggy with it!
4455280	4456400	Got pain!
4457840	4458640	Got pain.
4463360	4464320	All right.
4464320	4467120	I take... What's Ebola?
4467120	4468560	Is that like a cat of nine tails?
4469600	4472400	It's kind of like that, except instead of having like a whip handle,
4472720	4476480	you'd whip it around and throw it and hope to ensnare your foes by the legs.
4476480	4477840	It won't hurt him.
4477840	4480160	It'll hurt a little bit if you hit him.
4480160	4480720	Not much.
4480720	4482880	It's mostly attempts to trip.
4483840	4484480	OK.
4484480	4484960	All right.
4484960	4490640	Well, what I do is I tie a wire saw to one of the bolas
4491840	4493280	and then I just fucking...
4493280	4494400	Don't look at me like that.
4495600	4496080	And then...
4499040	4502240	Also tie the red cap poison to that.
4502720	4506080	And I tie another thing of acid.
4506080	4506800	I should do that.
4510800	4514400	I put on my goggles at night because those googles overnight.
4515360	4519600	And all of that, I just kind of throw it.
4522400	4523280	All the good stuff.
4524160	4525920	Also one of my shoes because, you know...
4527280	4528880	Because no regrets, right?
4528880	4529440	Yeah, yeah.
4529440	4530720	Yeah.
4530720	4531220	Yolo.
4532080	4536480	So you throw it, but the added weight of all these non-aerodynamic objects
4536480	4538320	actually pulls it off its course.
4539360	4541040	Kind of falls a bit short.
4543360	4544560	Just sitting on the ground.
4547680	4548960	I go back and get my shoe.
4553040	4554160	That's all the stuff.
4555920	4557840	I tied it all together into it.
4557840	4559120	That's what had happened.
4559440	4560640	Yeah, I know, I know.
4560640	4561360	It's funny.
4563280	4567760	Attempting to retrieve your shoe, you attract the ire of one of the blade monster things.
4567760	4569360	Man, I can't win for losing.
4569360	4570640	It slashes you on the...
4571680	4573200	I was gonna say the right thigh again.
4573200	4574560	That doesn't even make sense.
4574560	4576800	On the back, dealing a mere two damage.
4577840	4578640	Okay.
4578640	4579280	Yeah.
4579280	4580640	You got your shoe back though, that's cool.
4581440	4583200	Hey, this could have gone a lot worse.
4585520	4586240	How close am I?
4586960	4590640	You are in melee range with these dudes.
4591360	4593840	I'm gonna try to kick one back and power attack another.
4593840	4594340	Okay.
4596480	4600720	Okay, so it's kind of tricky to pull these two moves off at the same time,
4600720	4602560	so I'm gonna give you a penalty on the kick
4602560	4605440	because you're gonna put more effort into the attack probably.
4605440	4606080	Jock alert.
4609840	4610960	Penalty on the kick.
4612720	4614240	Those are physical actions.
4615040	4616480	Somebody give this guy a pea bone.
4620160	4620660	Pabst.
4624800	4626800	You can't even pretend to talk, Jock.
4628160	4630640	Nah, real football home run there.
4630640	4631120	Go ahead.
4634560	4636240	So what happens after he does all that?
4636240	4637600	I don't even know anymore.
4637600	4638080	No.
4638080	4643360	Okay, so you try to kick the guy, but his semi-solid form
4643360	4645760	actually kind of morphs around it,
4645760	4648000	and your foot kind of just gets stuck a little bit.
4648800	4649520	It's not good.
4649520	4650400	It's not comfortable.
4650400	4651600	Not feeling good.
4651600	4655200	Is it this off-balance nature throws off your attack,
4655200	4659920	and you swing a bit wide, catching one on, you know, the tip of his head.
4660960	4664960	Doesn't hit him very hard, but you manage to nick him just a skosh.
4665760	4667280	Dealing about six damage.
4669440	4670640	Six damage.
4670640	4673200	Bro, I don't think he needed the kick.
4674000	4677920	I think that's what fucked us, but that's okay.
4678800	4680800	I threw all my belongings.
4680800	4683440	Throwing a garbage pile of stuff didn't help us.
4684400	4685040	No, no, no.
4685040	4687120	Guys, we should all take a second and drink some pea bones.
4688720	4689680	Aaron is asleep.
4690880	4694160	We're just dying of the two of you are pickering about your high kicks.
4694160	4694960	It's you, Sharpie.
4696000	4696880	Can I do anything?
4696880	4699600	You have one more action before you lose consciousness.
4699600	4700720	I have one more action.
4700720	4702960	I'm real sick.
4703280	4703760	You're out.
4704480	4704800	All right.
4706560	4707040	Sorry.
4707040	4708000	One more action.
4709200	4710880	I take this very seriously.
4710880	4711440	You should.
4711440	4712720	My final action.
4712720	4713680	You might die.
4713680	4716160	I hope I don't.
4720160	4727760	My final action is going to define me as a person.
4730080	4730960	God damn it.
4730960	4731520	This is going to be your legacy.
4731520	4732960	Would you like to ask the audience?
4734720	4736640	I want to, I want to, can I do a lifeline?
4737360	4738080	Yeah, go for it.
4738080	4738800	Final action.
4741120	4742320	What are you, who are you pointing at?
4742320	4742800	Go back.
4743760	4744560	What about the guy?
4744560	4745120	He knows.
4745120	4745760	He knows.
4745760	4746560	I don't know.
4746560	4747520	He knows.
4747520	4751680	Is there anybody in the audience that really knows what they would do with their final?
4753200	4753680	All right.
4753680	4755360	That first hand up there.
4755360	4757040	Some entire badger.
4757040	4758800	Some entire badger.
4759680	4760640	Is that level three?
4761440	4764000	I'll trust Adam.
4764000	4766400	Why would you go with badger as opposed to like?
4766400	4768000	Because those are hilarious.
4769760	4772960	No, I mean, they're really effective combatants.
4772960	4773840	Don't get me wrong.
4773840	4774160	All right.
4774160	4774560	All right.
4774560	4775520	Forget it.
4775520	4778960	In other words, his answer is you just cast a fucking combat spell.
4778960	4782560	I just wanted to make sure.
4782560	4784000	It is level three, you guys.
4784000	4784480	Sorry.
4785520	4787280	Sorry to rain on everyone's parade.
4788320	4789360	Level three spell.
4790720	4791360	All right.
4791360	4793600	I'm going to, I know this is going to seem repetitive.
4793600	4796000	Yeah, but I got good results last time.
4797120	4801040	I'm going to pull out one of the shards.
4802080	4803600	One of those crystal shards.
4807920	4811360	Not the soul of growth, but one of those shards that we were.
4812160	4812560	Okay.
4812560	4813760	What we could do to encounter.
4813760	4815920	Is that the soul of growth you're pulling out?
4815920	4816880	No, no, no.
4816880	4818240	This is one of the shards.
4818240	4819040	Okay.
4819040	4820320	Don't tell us, tell them.
4821280	4824000	This is the shard of the unknown.
4825840	4826720	Inwards.
4829600	4830400	Nothing.
4830400	4831280	Nothing happened.
4833440	4833680	All right.
4833680	4834800	Can I summon a badger?
4837840	4838880	It's a level three spell.
4838880	4840080	You're out of those.
4840080	4841040	Oh shit.
4841680	4841920	All right.
4841920	4842720	Well, it's the small.
4842720	4842880	All right.
4842880	4844000	Look, scorching ray.
4844000	4844720	All right.
4844720	4845200	All right.
4845200	4847040	Casting your arms in a magical manner.
4847040	4849120	You fire off a couple of bolts of fire.
4849120	4850400	Yeah, that sounds good.
4850880	4851760	Yeah, it does.
4851760	4852800	That's good stuff.
4853840	4855520	That's what my character says to you.
4855520	4856560	That was good stuff.
4857440	4859840	Dealing 18 damage and filling.
4861840	4862720	Bad ass.
4862720	4863760	See, just leave it to me.
4864320	4865680	One of the remaining creatures.
4867200	4869440	That exertion, however, was all it took.
4870480	4875120	You feel yourself drift off and fall to the floor, unconscious.
4875760	4878320	So are there only two left now?
4878320	4880160	There are only two left.
4880240	4885360	And there are only two left of you raising the stakes.
4885360	4885840	All right.
4885840	4887600	Well, let's finish this battle real quick.
4887600	4888560	Is it their turn now?
4889280	4889680	Yeah.
4889680	4895040	So they actually, now that one of them has dropped dead and the other two of you guys are,
4895040	4896560	so it's like two on two, right?
4896560	4899920	They kind of square off and they just charge towards you.
4899920	4904160	You can see their limbs and their underbodies kind of turn into the smoky thing and they
4904160	4907520	kind of turn into spectral forms as they charge towards you.
4907520	4912320	And they actually just blast straight through you and you feel a violent chill go through your body.
4913920	4914400	Yeah.
4914400	4915360	Violent indeed.
4917760	4919840	You take nine damage.
4919840	4925280	You feel your insides just feel as if they've been frozen solid somehow and you double over in pain.
4926560	4927520	That happens.
4927520	4928480	You get pee boned.
4929280	4929780	Fuck.
4931280	4931680	All right.
4931680	4933600	Well, I-
4933600	4935360	That is what getting pee boned is like.
4935680	4942880	I untie all the things that I've tied up into a useless ball.
4945120	4947520	And so I'm pretty close to them, right?
4947520	4948020	Yup.
4948560	4949440	I take a-
4949440	4951120	Just do something normal.
4951120	4953280	Just swing a weapon at them.
4953280	4954720	Bro, I got no weapons.
4954720	4956400	I'm haunting you like Ben Kenobi.
4957600	4960720	Can I- Is the wiresaw something I can use against them?
4960720	4961840	You have weapons, dude.
4962480	4963440	Wiresaw.
4963440	4969040	You're like that one globetrotter from the globetrotter cartoon that would pull things out of his hair.
4969040	4970160	Out of his afro, yeah.
4971200	4971920	I'll use a-
4971920	4972960	I use a telephone.
4973600	4974720	You'll use one now?
4974720	4978640	I use a telephone to call in Uber and get out of here.
4979520	4980800	Okay, I use the bow.
4980800	4984960	I use the bow and it says I have times three critical.
4984960	4987920	Yeah, that means if you critical hit, it's super effective.
4988640	4990880	Attack bonus plus nine, damage is-
4992480	4994640	Attack bonus plus nine is helpful to me, actually.
4994640	4995600	All right, let's do it.
4995600	4998080	So I rolled the attack and apparently you've hit.
4998080	5000480	So firing an arrow from your short bow,
5000480	5003600	you strike one of the remaining foes directly and is-
5004720	5006240	Why directly every time?
5006240	5006960	Why?
5006960	5010240	Chest, dealing six damage.
5010240	5010880	Plus nine.
5012160	5014000	Plus nine is your to hit.
5014000	5016400	The damage is just the 1D.
5016400	5016960	I have ten.
5016960	5018080	It might be the 1D eight.
5019120	5020160	Okay, all right.
5020160	5021200	Let's move past it.
5022160	5023520	Putting in a quark's turn.
5023520	5024560	Can I cleave again?
5024560	5025360	What's on?
5025360	5026240	Cleave again?
5026240	5027120	Oh yeah, yeah.
5027120	5028080	Yeah, let's do that.
5028080	5029440	Yeah, worked last time, right?
5030720	5031200	All right.
5032080	5033440	It didn't work so well this time.
5034720	5035120	Pulling-
5035840	5036880	It didn't work last time.
5036880	5039920	He put his foot through the guy and then nicked the head.
5039920	5042480	I'm getting so mixed up, you guys.
5042480	5043520	This is crazy.
5045360	5045840	What?
5045840	5049760	If he flanks, then you can backstab him and end this fight and be awesome.
5049760	5052080	Well, yeah, but he's the flanking one.
5052080	5054000	He doesn't get sneak attack damage.
5054000	5055440	Yeah, that's true.
5055440	5055680	Okay.
5056560	5057440	Yeah, you guys.
5057440	5061040	Anyway, so he doesn't hit is what I'm trying to say.
5061040	5064880	With your great sword, you swing a bit, you know, you swing a bit.
5064880	5068080	But, you know, they just flew through you and you're all iced up inside.
5068080	5069120	So that's tough.
5069760	5070480	You don't hit.
5071120	5071760	It happens.
5072720	5073360	I'm sorry.
5076000	5077520	Okay, is it their turn again?
5077520	5078240	Yeah, it is.
5078560	5079200	We're so fucked.
5079200	5079840	We're fucked.
5079840	5081280	We're so fucked.
5081280	5082400	What's going to happen?
5082400	5083840	Are you only able to dream?
5084880	5086320	Yeah, do you want to dream?
5086320	5088000	Well, I mean, because we're unconscious.
5088000	5090000	Yeah, that's why I'm asking if you want to dream.
5090000	5091200	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5091200	5091760	Oh, boy.
5094480	5098720	I dream of a cloud that's made out of horse fur.
5100240	5107280	And I take off all of my clothes and I cover myself in lotion and I tumble across the horse
5107360	5111120	fur and Fiona Apples playing in the background.
5111120	5115360	And pizzas come down from the sky and they fall in my face, but there are no calories.
5118480	5120320	And then also I defeat the enemy, I guess.
5121120	5121760	That's my dream.
5121760	5122720	That's a pretty good dream.
5123840	5126400	Yeah, so the shadowy beings, both of their limbs.
5127120	5128080	What about my dream?
5128960	5130800	You know, I mean, yeah, go for a dream.
5130800	5135120	Yeah, I have a dream that races get along.
5135120	5137680	I wrote it.
5142240	5144000	Anytime you guys want to go back to that poll.
5145040	5150080	I have a dream that me and Lime shirt are signing the deal on a house together.
5150880	5154560	When in reality, you just won't let it go.
5158080	5159120	What's your name, Limey?
5161200	5162880	None of this is making it better.
5162880	5163680	Yeah.
5163680	5165280	All of this is making it worse.
5168000	5170960	This is like the bad touch of conversations.
5170960	5171440	I'm sorry.
5172080	5174640	My dream, Phil and I are creating.
5174640	5175840	You had your dream.
5175840	5178160	You rolled around in a horse lotion.
5180080	5181440	I solved racism.
5182560	5183440	You don't get to.
5183440	5185840	But also Phil and I self-hunger.
5185840	5187440	Also, we built a dollhouse together.
5187440	5188560	That's your second dream.
5189360	5190320	That's a third dream.
5191520	5193280	There's one dream per turn, you guys.
5194640	5196640	I'm going to have to be firm on this.
5196640	5198880	Spencer, how are we going to defeat these guys?
5198880	5199680	Is it going to take a second?
5199680	5200640	Well, I mean, I don't know.
5202400	5203520	No, we're going to see this through.
5203520	5205040	I think we're about to die.
5205040	5205520	Okay.
5205520	5205840	All right.
5205840	5206640	Let's hope so.
5206640	5207120	Is it there?
5211040	5213280	I don't get why that got a reaction.
5213280	5214720	Because you seem grumpy.
5214720	5216720	Because we're fucking hateful assholes.
5216720	5217200	What?
5217200	5218720	Can we cliffhang it?
5218720	5220400	No, let's cliffhang it.
5220400	5221920	We're about to either die or...
5222880	5224160	What is their turn, right?
5224160	5226960	So both of their limbs have turned into smoke at this point.
5226960	5230160	But they went through you, iced your insides,
5230160	5233040	you twisted around, failed some attacks, right?
5233040	5234080	And that happened.
5234080	5236560	And then both of their limbs turn into smoke
5236560	5238720	and they just fly directly towards you.
5238720	5240000	It's like they're strangling you.
5240000	5241920	You can actually feel your throats being
5241920	5244880	throttled as the smoke is invading your senses.
5244880	5248000	And yeah, it's not good.
5248000	5250480	So a moment ago, he had the soul of growth out.
5250480	5250960	Yeah.
5251200	5252560	It's invisible, can I see it?
5252560	5254480	It's like he's clutching it in his hand.
5254480	5257200	Right now, you can't move too much.
5257200	5259920	You're being strangled, being exertioned to move around.
5259920	5261440	I sneak behind one.
5261440	5262640	I'm going to lose consciousness.
5262640	5263440	And I...
5263440	5265200	It's got its hands around your throat.
5265200	5266080	Not me, right?
5266080	5266720	Yeah, both of you.
5267280	5269120	Yeah, they squared off one each.
5269120	5271200	Yeah, they're both taking on each of you guys.
5272160	5273760	Well, I kind of stab his guy.
5273760	5275520	Like, I do this kind of thing.
5275520	5275760	Okay.
5276960	5277520	All right.
5277520	5279440	Like, you know, because I can't reach my guy.
5280320	5280960	I kind of like...
5283120	5284880	Hey, I'll get your guy.
5284880	5285920	That makes sense to me.
5287600	5288880	So yeah, you do that.
5288880	5291360	You stab him just a bit, dealing six damage.
5292320	5292880	Just a bit.
5294320	5295280	Shit, we're dying.
5295280	5295760	Shit.
5296400	5296720	Shit.
5296720	5298000	That's the cool thing about this game.
5298000	5298640	You can die.
5298640	5299440	Oh, fuck.
5299440	5300240	All right, all right.
5300240	5301520	We're going to die tonight.
5302240	5304160	Quark, what you got, baby?
5304160	5308240	So if I don't think I can actually grab the soul of growth,
5308240	5309680	I'm going to try to cleave again.
5309680	5310560	Okay.
5310560	5311840	So yeah, yeah.
5311840	5312640	Cleaving again.
5313520	5314480	Cool move, man.
5315200	5315840	I dig it.
5318480	5319120	Uh-oh.
5319120	5320880	He knows something we don't know.
5320880	5321760	I don't like that.
5321760	5323200	This is what suspense is.
5323200	5324640	Spencer is maniacally laughing.
5324640	5326000	Oh, yeah, it's happening.
5326880	5329680	So being strangled, actually, as it happens,
5329680	5331440	impacts your accuracy.
5331440	5334640	And you swing wildly, trying to cleave through both of these
5335440	5337440	beings in one, but it's not happening.
5337440	5338400	It's not happening.
5340000	5340960	It just doesn't happen.
5342480	5344080	That's quite a build up for not happening.
5344080	5345200	This is us dying.
5345200	5348880	Your grip loosens on the sword as it drops from your hands
5348880	5350400	and you fall to your knees.
5350400	5351200	Oh, God.
5352000	5352160	I...
5354080	5356000	Are on the verge of unconsciousness.
5356640	5360960	I take this opportunity to...
5362640	5363120	So he...
5363120	5364400	Did he fuck me last night?
5364400	5364880	Or no?
5366000	5367120	No, he didn't.
5367360	5367860	Okay.
5368640	5369920	I think we have time for that.
5370720	5372240	Why wasn't that anyone's dream?
5374240	5380320	I put my soft penis inside him and have it grow
5381280	5384000	like the fungus is growing inside of me right now.
5385040	5388320	Summoning the last vestiges of your will to your mighty member.
5388320	5389920	I have a poison dagger.
5389920	5390420	Okay.
5391440	5392400	I like that better.
5395840	5396340	Okay.
5397120	5404240	I take my poison dagger and I stab the bad guys.
5406560	5407040	You miss.
5409200	5409760	Oh, my God.
5409760	5411200	I think we're all done here.
5411200	5412560	What's going to happen?
5412560	5413440	How do I miss?
5414080	5417280	Because, again, as it happens, when you're being strangled
5417280	5420480	and smoke's going down your throat and you're coughing and stuff
5420480	5426160	and wheezing and not breathing, combat sort of gets harder.
5427440	5428160	It's just a thing.
5428160	5429520	It's like, you know, in Game of War...
5429520	5431760	Only we would have gotten you a sandwich.
5432720	5434720	Yeah, but it didn't happen, did it?
5438400	5442000	I'm sitting here with a bag of chips and a Milky Way bar.
5442000	5443120	Murdering us.
5443120	5446480	Yeah, just laying waste to Dungeons and Dragons.
5446480	5446960	What's it?
5448160	5448800	Go ahead.
5448800	5449600	Commit.
5449600	5451280	Guys all lose consciousness.
5451280	5452560	You can't see anything.
5452560	5453280	We all do.
5454000	5457760	Can my last move be to put the bag of holding over one of these guys' heads?
5457760	5459200	Yeah, we can definitely try.
5459200	5459760	Yeah, Bill.
5461120	5462080	Oh, my God.
5462080	5462640	Oh, my God.
5462640	5463840	Bill, what if you murder us?
5465360	5465840	You do.
5465840	5467120	I mean, do it.
5468960	5469440	Do it.
5469440	5470560	Over whose head again?
5470560	5471040	I'm sorry.
5472240	5472560	All right.
5472560	5473440	Over the smoking gun.
5473440	5473920	Yeah, over the smoking gun.
5473920	5475200	With your last dying...
5475200	5476160	Nope, doesn't happen.
5479360	5480480	Sorry, sorry, Bill.
5480480	5481040	Sorry, Bill.
5481600	5484720	Bill, your funnest is growing all over this game.
5485600	5487600	So we all go unconscious.
5487600	5488720	Yeah, you're all unconscious.
5488720	5489120	All right.
5489120	5491040	That's the place where we should...
5491040	5493920	Until you regain it in the future.
5494560	5495600	Or die.
5495600	5497360	Or die in the past.
5497360	5498480	That's like a logical image.
5498480	5500320	This is the fuck of a cliffhanger.
5500320	5500880	All right.
5500880	5502000	All right, that's it.
5502000	5502560	He indeed.
5505280	5505840	Thanks, Bill.
5505840	5506480	Thank you, Bill.
5507600	5508160	Thank you, Bill.
5511520	5512480	All right.
5512480	5514320	Well, what have we learned tonight, Camille?
5516000	5517680	Don't put yourself out there.
5521280	5523040	Unless you're fungus.
5523040	5523920	Unless you're fungus.
5523920	5525600	In which case, like, go for it.
5526400	5528160	The big winner tonight is fungus.
5528160	5528880	Yeah.
5528880	5529440	Seems like...
5531280	5534240	Yeah, like, you can die in D&D.
5534240	5535120	You can get your ass kicked.
5535120	5535600	What happened?
5535600	5536080	Are we gonna...
5537120	5538400	This is very upsetting.
5538400	5540640	I'm genuinely a little shaken.
5541040	5541920	I'm genuinely shaken.
5541920	5543280	That's what makes it a good game.
5543280	5544320	We might all die.
5544320	5545200	And then what happens?
5545200	5547040	I have to create new characters.
5547040	5548560	Start over, like, a bunch of pussies.
5549760	5551360	Have you died in D&D before?
5552720	5553280	Yeah, a million times.
5553280	5555440	Apparently, someone was telling me about this documentary.
5555440	5556560	Was it you, Spencer?
5556560	5559760	This documentary about this dungeon master
5559760	5562480	who, like, got pissed off and they had this game
5562480	5563840	that they'd been playing for years.
5563840	5564560	Like, five guys.
5564560	5565440	Do you know what I'm talking about?
5565440	5566400	No, it was me, sorry.
5566400	5567200	And he got, like, angry.
5567200	5568400	He was having a shitty day.
5568400	5570080	And he ended up killing all those people.
5570080	5572080	And they all got really upset at him.
5572080	5574720	And then the documentary is set years later
5574720	5578080	where this guy is going back to, like, reconnect
5578080	5580640	with all the people who he killed in the D&D game.
5581920	5583680	So, Spencer, I'm sorry.
5583680	5586000	Even that you can't do in the documentary
5586000	5587280	because it's already happened.
5588800	5589200	All right.
5589200	5590000	I'll get through.
5591280	5592640	Well, usually when Jeff's here,
5592640	5593600	this is the point in the show
5593600	5594800	where we don't know how to end it.
5596240	5596640	All right.
5597520	5599120	I will keep the tradition alive.
5600880	5603840	So, when was the last time you cried, Dan?
5605520	5607120	Uh, I don't know.
5607120	5609120	I can't remember when the last time I cried is.
5609120	5611760	Probably I watched probably some sad movie or something.
5611760	5612560	Okay.
5612560	5615280	What did I, uh, probably cried.
5616160	5616960	What did we watch?
5619200	5620720	Must have been some documentary.
5620720	5622480	Probably cried during some documentary.
5622480	5622880	Yeah.
5622880	5624400	There's some rough ones out there.
5625200	5626080	There's this one called,
5626080	5628720	and I only name it so that you never watch it.
5629360	5630880	It's called Dear Zachary.
5630880	5631920	Do you know what I'm talking about?
5632720	5633200	Do not.
5633200	5635440	If you haven't seen it, do not watch it.
5635440	5636800	I'm genuinely saying,
5636800	5639600	because Emily and I got into a lot of like real crime docs
5639600	5640960	and we just watched them over and over.
5640960	5642000	This was just one of them.
5642640	5644400	It should come with a fucking warning.
5644400	5646720	Like, oh, do not watch this one.
5646720	5648560	That's all it, the movie should be called,
5648560	5649440	do not watch this.
5650560	5652000	Because it's a bunch of them about people
5652000	5653360	wrongly in prison and then escaping
5653360	5654720	and then this one is like too much.
5654720	5655600	So, yeah.
5655600	5655920	Oh, man.
5657040	5657440	All right.
5657520	5661040	Well, I can only think that we've got to...
5661040	5661680	Do the song?
5662960	5664800	Do the song?
5664800	5665680	There's a song?
5665680	5668560	Well, don't you do, you'll like do a song
5668560	5669440	about the whole show.
5670720	5671520	Yeah, hit it.
5671520	5671760	Yeah.
5675520	5676400	What do you got in the booth?
5676400	5676880	All right.
5676880	5677280	Yeah.
5677280	5677760	Yeah.
5677760	5678000	All right.
5678000	5679120	I feel like we learned a lot.
5679120	5679840	That was a good one.
5679840	5683840	Now, usually, they play a rap beat
5683840	5685360	that does not end the show.
5685360	5688000	Usually, it just goes into a terrible rap and then...
5688000	5688960	I'm ready for that.
5688960	5690160	And then the show just has to end
5690160	5692080	in spite of me trying to end it with a rap.
5692720	5693920	This is going to be the first night
5693920	5697360	where the rap is catastrophically brilliant.
5698000	5699280	That just ends the show.
5699280	5701040	Those two words don't go together.
5702800	5703280	All right.
5703280	5718160	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5718160	5720560	Lime shirt doesn't matter that you're in here.
5721360	5723040	Fuck your mama without fear.
5723680	5724480	That's stupid.
5724480	5725040	Who cares?
5726400	5727440	This just seems...
5727440	5729040	Something about that felt like really...
5729680	5730800	I wonder what it was.
5733840	5733840	
5737280	5739600	You take the guy who's already been chat on
5739600	5741360	and then talk about how you fucked his mom
5742160	5744080	without fear or regret.
5744080	5744560	Yeah.
5745440	5746000	I don't know.
5746000	5746640	It just doesn't.
5747200	5747520	All right.
5747520	5748480	All right.
5748480	5749520	Like traditional...
5749520	5750240	All right.
5750240	5750640	Topic.
5750640	5751680	Somebody give me a topic.
5751680	5752560	Fungus.
5752560	5753040	Fungus.
5754320	5755120	We've discussed fungus.
5755120	5755680	One more try.
5755680	5756160	One more try.
5756160	5756720	Racism.
5758480	5758960	Fungus.
5759600	5762800	The fungus is of racism and softball.
5764080	5764720	Yo.
5764720	5765220	Yo.
5766640	5767280	Yo.
5767280	5767920	Yo.
5767920	5770400	Little mushrooms grow up in the air.
5770400	5771520	Spore is spreading.
5771520	5772400	They don't care.
5772400	5775520	They gotta go from one location to another.
5775520	5777520	They fuck your daddy and they fuck your mother.
5777520	5780640	They go from a piece of bread to some meat.
5780640	5782880	Don't care if they go down the street.
5782880	5785760	They're mushrooms that spread through the air.
5785760	5786240	This...
5786240	5787280	It doesn't work.
5787280	5787780	Okay.
5788800	5789600	All right.
5789600	5790560	How do you end the show?
5790560	5792000	How do you end a fucking show?
5792000	5793760	I was so into that rap.
5795040	5795920	You have no idea.
5795920	5797520	I forgot there were people here.
5797520	5800000	I forgot I was comp trolling.
5800000	5801600	I was these mushrooms.
5802400	5804080	Fucking that guy's mom and dad.
5805920	5807520	You gotta figure out a way to end the show.
5807520	5808080	Well, no.
5808080	5810720	I think you just have to like commit to the thing.
5810720	5813520	I feel like the rap is really good.
5814240	5816800	And I think you get to that moment
5816800	5818400	where you like think about it too much.
5818400	5821840	I feel like you have to just go with it and not quit.
5821840	5823120	And just keep going.
5823120	5825840	And at the end of the rap, it's gonna be a beautiful piece.
5825840	5827520	How do you know when the rap is over?
5827520	5828560	If it's made up?
5828560	5828880	All right.
5828880	5829280	You're right.
5829280	5829920	I'm full of shit.
5831840	5833600	It's over when it feels like...
5833600	5834480	Well, can we make a...
5834480	5834800	Okay.
5834800	5835760	Here's the thing.
5835760	5838720	I'll go a certain number of rhymes.
5838720	5842640	And then you do like a Vincent Price like bridge.
5842640	5843840	Like where you just talk.
5843840	5844880	Okay. All right.
5844880	5847840	Did I hear that like crazy Middle Eastern like racist...
5850000	5850400	All right.
5850400	5852480	This is a crazy Middle Eastern rap.
5852480	5855440	Point at me and I'll just talk like boys to men used to and stuff.
5855440	5856640	We're always like, all right, girl.
5856640	5858640	This will be a politically poignant rap.
5858640	5860560	Like I'll rap and then I'll point...
5860560	5863120	When I point at you, then you'll just talk about whatever.
5864480	5866480	You just being in it will make it profound.
5866480	5866880	All right.
5867920	5868640	Okay.
5868640	5869600	Yeah. See?
5869600	5870640	So just point at me.
5870640	5871440	Point at me.
5871440	5872160	Yo.
5872160	5872160	
5872160	5872960	Yo.
5872960	5873680	Yo.
5873680	5874400	Middle East.
5874400	5875120	Yo.
5875120	5875600	Yo.
5877360	5879920	Going down the avenue.
5880000	5880560	Wait.
5880560	5880800	Shit.
5880800	5881520	Well, I'm sorry.
5881520	5882800	I didn't hear the beat.
5882800	5883600	Yo.
5883600	5884080	Yo.
5884080	5885040	Yo.
5885040	5886560	Middle East rap.
5886560	5887920	Middle East rap.
5887920	5888720	Yo.
5888720	5889360	Whoa.
5889360	5895200	Crazy things going on in a place that's bombin' on.
5895200	5897120	Regulatic in the Middle East.
5898000	5901040	You gotta beat the beast with the missiles.
5901040	5902400	Got the foreign policy.
5903360	5904400	Oh shit.
5904400	5908320	Look at you and me not getting along country to country.
5909120	5911920	Fuck your mama so hard she fell in love with me.
5913520	5914960	Nothing to do with it.
5914960	5917600	Pakistan gonna go through with it.
5917600	5919040	Can I use your airspace?
5919040	5920160	Can I use your land?
5920800	5922880	Fuck your mama with the back of my hand.
5922880	5926400	I put my fist in a pussy and I felt her ovaries.
5927920	5928400	Sorry.
5930320	5931840	Keep getting off topic.
5932480	5934400	Fuck your mama so far.
5934400	5935520	Got tropic.
5935520	5937680	Gave her malaria.
5937680	5940640	Fuck your mama so hard she got a stereo.
5940640	5943520	Had to pull out everything inside.
5944400	5946480	Opened her up till she was wide.
5946480	5948320	Walked into her and said,
5948320	5949360	Look at this.
5949360	5950880	Put some curtains over here.
5950880	5952400	We could really do this.
5953760	5955680	Put a coffee table there.
5955680	5956720	Go to IKEA.
5956720	5958560	Just act like we don't care.
5958560	5960240	Put some feng shui.
5960240	5961680	I have a mirror there.
5961680	5962720	This is bad luck.
5962720	5964640	You come up the south stair.
5965520	5966960	People come in and they can smoke.
5968160	5969200	On the patio?
5969200	5970000	It's not a joke.
5970640	5972320	Decorating your mama's pussy.
5973360	5975280	I'm decorating your mama's pussy.
5976400	5978960	Re-decorating your mama's pussy.
5978960	5981440	It's a metaphor for U.S. policy.
5982240	5984160	I guess what we're trying to say is
5985360	5987040	shit's bad in the Middle East
5987040	5989920	and all you can do is distract yourself
5989920	5992160	by fucking somebody's mother
5992160	5994720	or going to IKEA
5994720	5997120	or eating jerky with fungus on it.
5998560	6000480	You know, that kind of stuff.
6001200	6003600	I genuinely feel there's no real way
6003600	6005520	to fix that part of the world.
6006320	6007520	So all you can do is
6007520	6008720	listen to this rap.
6011520	6012960	Tabahawk missile.
6012960	6013760	Cruise missile.
6014880	6015360	Thistle.
6015920	6017040	Jandelion thistle.
6017600	6018160	Tahini.
6019040	6019680	Falafel.
6020320	6021120	But your mama.
6022240	6022880	Falafel.
6024960	6025520	Falafel.
6026400	6026960	Tahini.
6027840	6028480	Falafel.
6029440	6030240	Falafel.
6030240	6030800	Hold on.
6030800	6031440	Falafel.
6033680	6034320	Kedafel.
6036640	6037280	Falafel.
6039520	6040160	Kedafel.
6040880	6041520	Egypt.
6042160	6042960	North Korea.
6044480	6045120	Oh, shit.
6047520	6048160	All right, well,
6050240	6051040	think about it.
6053040	6053840	Hormontown!
6055520	6056880	Thank you so much for coming.
6058400	6059040	And Hormontown.
6061040	6062880	Really think about it.
6062880	6064160	Think about it, guys.
6064160	6064880	Thank you, Camille.
6064880	6066320	Thank you, Spencer.
6068320	6071200	Thank you, Zach and Dustin in the audio.
6071200	6072800	Mo, Falafel, Fafel.
6074800	6076080	Who else do we have to thank?
6077200	6078320	Danielle and...
6079520	6081440	I think that's the part that the Falafel
6081440	6083280	and Kedafel have been rhymed.
6083280	6085360	So take that home with you.
6085360	6086880	All right, well, yeah, go for it.
6086960	6089760	Well, yeah, go home and Wikipedia the Middle East
6089760	6091680	and really think about what I told you tonight.
