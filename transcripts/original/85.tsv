0	25140	hinting to him because human
30000	36560	let's welcome to the stage the mayor of
36560	38840	Harman town
38840	62560	it's ridiculous that song it's called
62560	67560	little Willie no offense I don't know if
67560	68760	you had anything you wanted to talk
68760	70360	about tonight but we got a mysterious
70360	72280	package delivered to us in the green
72280	74680	room really appears to be a self
74680	78200	published book by a man named Daniel
78200	82360	Quinn called beyond civilization
82360	86720	humanity's next great adventure and
86720	89320	you're all wondering do I simply have to
89320	94080	wrap something in brown paper and send
94080	96040	it to the green room in order to have
96040	98160	have you focus your episode on it but
98160	101640	read the first read the first like
101640	104280	couple set actually want to read what
104280	109240	caught my eye on the back it says in
109240	111160	beyond a civilization
111160	113680	Daniel Quinn thinks the unthinkable
113680	121280	now we have to assume Daniel Quinn wrote
121280	125440	this but so but but that doesn't matter
125440	128480	everyone everyone comes to a point in
128480	130040	their life when it's impossible to think
130040	132800	the unthinkable thinks the unthinkable
132800	135920	we all know there's no one right way to
135920	142040	build a bicycle no you're laughing at
142040	143320	that because it's specific but it's true
143320	146760	that's what hooks me in we all know
146760	148880	there's no one right way to build a
148880	151440	bicycle no one right way to design an
151440	153880	automobile no one right way to make a
153880	157240	pair of shoes but we're convinced that
157240	159920	there must be only one right way to live
159920	163240	and the one we have is it no matter what
163560	167080	so the supposition of the book is that
167080	173000	you're a pig-headed asshole and but but
173000	175920	but no I mean it's it's it looks it's
175920	177160	sort of like I feel like there's only
177160	181360	one way to build a bicycle certainly
181360	183760	certainly two tires have to be involved
183760	186160	yeah or you've or you've urged into
186160	189420	tricycle territory and they have to be
189420	191240	in a row otherwise you'd fall right over
191240	199480	I could see a thing where there's like
199480	202280	two tires like a segue a segue Daniel
202280	206560	Quinn what are you doing here is a segue
206560	210920	a bicycle it's got two tires no the
210920	212240	inventor of the segue would have you
212240	214760	believe the segue is not a bicycle he
214760	216200	would have he would have in his book
216200	221200	called segue adventures would have you
221200	222880	believe that the segue is a new
222880	225040	invention maybe it's just a bicycle
225040	227560	right so so whose side are you on here
227560	231700	Daniel Quinn's you like him for being an
231700	234100	iconoclast yeah I like I like him for
234100	237280	asking questions man well I like him for
237280	240340	sending a secret is his book organized
240340	241600	by question are there are there more
241600	243880	questions it's kind of it's weird it's
243880	245500	like they asked me to rethink other
245500	247240	things if you page through it looked at
247240	249040	it would look like it was like some like
249040	252480	riddle book from the 80s I mean each
252480	254400	age is just like I'm looking over your
254400	257760	shoulder the bottom fourth of every page
257760	260120	is blank yeah it's because each page is
260120	264360	just a thought like one page look
264360	268240	she's Jeffrey yeah that's me and he
268240	269920	often refers to some other book that he
269920	272400	wrote this is in my ishmael that's a
272400	274000	book that he wrote I recounted the life
274000	275960	of a young man named Jeffrey loosely
275960	278100	based on Paul Eppinger whose journal was
278140	279820	published by his father under the title
279820	283940	wrestling why is every bottom fourth of
283940	285900	every page blank for notes because he
285900	289020	finishes his shit man because he gets
289020	291420	his thoughts out well otherwise the
291420	293420	page the books only like like a like a
293420	295700	pamphlet Daniel Quinn if you're out there
295700	297340	thank you for the book thank you for
297340	298940	sending it I opened it give me this
298940	303780	bucket Daniel Quinn please come down
303780	308620	undoubtedly from Canada and I'm 90%
308620	311500	certain you're Canadian and defend this
311500	316220	defend this use of paper I'm looking at
316220	319540	two pages where there's no more than 80
319540	323020	characters on the entire two pages okay
323020	327020	part two closing in on the process dot
327020	329420	dot dot and I'm gonna come in at this
329420	333620	with an open mind then well I mean I'm
333620	335660	not mocking the person well yeah like
335660	338220	when Eminem writes controversial rap
338220	339860	lyrics and they have somebody got CNN
339860	342420	was defaced and abandoned the city's
342420	344780	ultimate collapse whatever happened the
344780	347100	city was destroyed the collapse may have
347100	349700	been caused by and it was making them
349700	357700	sound like a jig off on purpose to think
357700	360980	the impossible think one of these days
360980	363300	I'm gonna write a book and it will be
363620	367140	many of the pages will be empty I just
367140	371300	don't maybe how about this if every page
371300	374380	is going to be equally blank for the
374380	376940	bottom fourth or fifth of the page make
376940	380900	us make a shorter book consolidate it
380900	382500	you're saying I'm saying cut cut the
382500	387540	bottom fourth of the book make it a
387540	390980	little smaller well you're logic
390980	392620	everything should be on microfiche I'm
392620	395140	saying if I as I flash through this you
395140	398500	could there's certainly room down there
398500	400620	to invite a mad magazine artist or
400620	404100	something yeah certainly there's new
404100	405580	levels that could be added that's
405580	407660	definitely I don't know it's probably not
407660	409620	his fault I think that would go to the
409620	412100	publisher right the publisher being
412100	417980	David Quinn waste team make papers and
417980	422420	alright so we so we took a dump on some
422420	427260	poor kid is he a kid I imagine okay then
427260	430340	I don't I don't think you're 40 and
430340	432260	you're doing stuff like that I don't
432260	435180	know I think that's smacks of a 25 year
435180	438780	olds if I trade of lunch in the world
438780	441420	if I'm being hard on it simply because
441420	447780	like come on like alright so we hazed we
447780	451540	hazed the you could end one three-line
451540	454140	poem and then start a new one a couple
454140	456100	lines beneath that and keep the brain a
456100	460180	poem I mean I read it and this is page
460180	462540	who the fuck knows cuz if pages aren't
462540	466220	numbered what wait why page no I can't
466220	468340	see that I could get on board with that
468340	470420	yeah page number is just a way to tell a
470420	474180	brother he's like many tires to know
474180	477140	this is part for the toward the new
477140	479820	tribalism this is a this is a two and a
479820	483740	half line little little graffiti toe it
483740	486180	says we aren't trying to think of
486180	488740	hunters and gatherers as poor because
488740	490460	they don't have anything perhaps better
490460	492420	to think of them for that reason that's
492420	498180	free wait but that's that's attributed
498180	499980	to Marshall Solon so he's just quoting
499980	503620	people this stuff he's come upon in his
503620	505020	life that he wants to share with you
505020	507740	alright and you're you're you know you're
507740	510180	chasing I know I mean I should write a
510180	517940	book all right so can we please let's
517940	524180	let's let's so what did we do we now we
524180	525380	now we all know what you shouldn't do
525380	526740	you shouldn't write a book like that you
526740	529220	shouldn't send it to us again I say it's
529220	531540	more in the publisher the format is what's
531540	534340	got me but I do think it's an interesting
534340	539380	idea that we civilizations like bicycles
539380	542700	or can openers or shoes are inventions
542700	546500	their systems that we have devised
546500	550380	collectively they're larger than shoes
550380	553140	and can openers but they are they're
553140	555900	just little things that we invented we've
555900	558100	decided at some point that civilization
558100	559860	should resemble they should have a
559860	562180	certain shape to them they should because
562180	565300	what do you do when your species become
565300	567500	so successful that it's outbreeding the
567500	569900	bears wolves and cats that used to eat
569900	574060	it what do you do you form a
574060	577140	civilization you form rules you build a
577140	579460	big wall or you can't keep killing each
579460	583660	other gutting each other like we we came
583660	587380	up with a very very thin like kind of
587380	591300	detente a long time ago like let's let's
591300	594260	not hurt each other holy shit let's
594260	596020	let's let's love each other is it the
596020	598060	right way do we think of each other in
598060	599780	the right way if we were to go to the
599780	602060	moon Jeff do you think that people think
602060	603220	of each other as people that we shouldn't
603220	608100	hurt or use or abuse yeah you do yeah I
608100	609980	mean I think if you look around at any
609980	612260	no we're doing terrible things to each
612260	614820	other yeah at all times yeah but I think
614820	616140	I think that the only reason we stopped
616140	617540	moving we stopped hunting is because we
617540	619660	found out that if like when you start we
619660	621700	started mastering metals and stone and
621700	623620	masonry and things we could insulate
623620	625540	ourselves that we didn't have to keep
625540	627640	moving around we could start we could
627640	630140	start making permanent dwellings and
630140	632780	that gave us leisure time and that
632780	634420	created things like arts and created
634420	635900	things like textiles and stuff like that
635900	639140	also it created the idea that men
639140	641260	treated women like shit forever like
641260	643620	like all kinds of other goodies well it
643620	647020	would yes okay so there's an interesting
647260	652620	strange irony there because it would
652620	656940	seem that mankind kind of is very cruel
656940	661580	to itself when we have shit on our
661580	664220	plate it always seems like there's
664220	666820	there's a there's a human impulse to be
666820	668980	inhuman to each other when we have the
668980	671340	excuse that we have so much shit to do
671340	674660	and then at the same time strangely
674660	679340	enough gender-wise it would seem like
679340	686180	luxury begets abuses yeah doesn't it
686180	688660	seem like the more the more dessert the
688660	690980	more well I mean the more free time we
690980	693900	get I'm sure we are to get it all the
693900	695420	way wrong because like I'm only like
695420	697220	remembering things poorly but like when
697220	699540	when things were like hunter-gatherer
699540	702340	that they tended to be matriarchal and
702340	704620	tend to be feminine and the moment that
704620	706060	we started building permanent dwellings
706060	708540	it was matched becomes patrilineal
708540	709900	where we're gonna if I'm gonna build a
709900	712620	thing I'm gonna pass it down to my my
712620	715500	male heir and then women would get pushed
715500	716860	to the it's almost like there's two
716860	719580	different tracks that we that we that we
719580	723260	feel on because the history of this
723260	725700	amazing country just to look at that as
725700	729060	a microcosm of it the insanely
729060	733380	poetically tragically ironic fact that
733380	736180	we built this country on slavery which
736180	738060	couldn't be a more inhuman act that you
738060	740580	take people from a different culture and
740580	743300	you say to them you are not human to us
743300	746860	we choose to use you to benefit ourselves
746860	749860	and we choose not to care about the
749860	752060	happiness and health of you and your
752060	755300	progeny we choose in fact to breed you
755300	757300	and herd you as if you were animals and
757300	758540	there's no other way to put it than
758540	760860	that and that is the true profanity of
760860	764660	slavery and and to build a country on
764660	767100	that and then to come around and go oh
767100	769300	you know what we were wrong about that
769300	771700	actually boy is anybody feeling nauseous
771700	773660	about this yeah right around the time
773660	775740	that industry affords us the opportunity
775740	777340	to replace these people with machines
777340	779900	yes we all start to feel nauseous about
779900	781460	it but kicking and screaming and then to
781460	785220	give those people the vote and then also
785220	787700	then after that sometime after that
787900	792460	say to women you are now also allowed to
792460	794620	participate in who's president there's
794620	796740	all kinds of amazing things when you
796740	799540	focus in on the the great modern cities
799540	801940	and I never to include in New York but
801940	803300	also like you look like Antwerp and
803300	805060	Brussels and like the great the great
805060	807620	cities of Europe were built on treating
807620	811460	people like a resource there are people
811460	813980	were murdered by the millions to make
813980	817620	great cities to get to create like to
817620	821420	get rubber to get gold to get like like
821420	824220	like really basic things that's why if
824220	825820	you go to Antwerp and it's sexy is
825820	828980	because of just slaughter of a thousand
828980	832580	people and then women got the vote later
832580	835180	which is fucking amazing later the women
835180	838860	that the women that the men who were
838860	843100	hurting each other the men can have
843100	848460	epiphanies about inhumanity and the
848460	849900	entire time they're having those
849900	852380	epiphanies they can go home to bed with
852380	855740	a woman that they are actively oppressing
855740	859300	as it is we were at the drawing room and
859300	861340	you like a couple weeks ago and you said
861340	863180	you were writing a thing for or vulture
863180	864580	magazine or whatever was asking you
864580	867940	about your your 20 cultural like
867940	869700	references right there are no women on
869700	871340	the list yeah you but you've read about
871340	873460	the things that informed you and I've
873460	875500	made a joke like no women huh and you're
875500	877420	like oh shit they're right like they're
877420	880060	right but then you said like Elaine
880060	883380	what's her name Elaine Morgan which
883380	884500	yeah which is may or may not be a
884500	887620	cultural thing but it really is but like
887620	891060	like what's yours like what's your
891060	893100	stance on like how do you perceive
893100	896060	femininity as in culture like it's a
896060	898700	pretty male thing our show tends to end
898700	900660	up being a lot of dudes on stage and
900660	905060	occasionally like a woman well I don't
905060	906900	know that's the thing that I think is so
906900	909540	fascinating about it is that mankind has
909540	912940	it within him too he can take a white
912940	919060	man can look at a another man who has
919060	920740	different cheekbones or different
920740	922900	pigmentation and he could make it does
922900	925620	he can switch some switch in his head
925620	930620	and say oh well I decide to dehumanize
930620	933060	this person I decide to commit the the
933060	935820	the the worst crime you can commit
935820	937220	against another human being which is to
937220	940420	dehumanize them I I will I will in fact
940420	943420	profit off of that dehumanization I will
943420	945260	switch off this thing in my head I will
945260	950780	use this person genocide just just like
950780	953500	like like like truly the worst crime you
953500	955860	could commit and then in that sort of
955860	959940	male stereotypical sense like watching
959940	962900	two guys fight at a bar where somebody
962900	964700	breaks a bottle and they they're
964700	966660	slashing at each other and then they
966660	968460	work out something and then they end up
968460	970060	with their arms around each other and
970060	971940	then there's some weird elephant in the
971940	974460	room where it's like but none of you
974460	977420	respect your wedding and then gender
977420	979940	politics still eludes us I think it's a
979940	981700	very it's a really weird thing because
981700	983980	no one wants to hear you don't want to
983980	985620	hear about it it makes you feel more
985620	987900	more it's harder to handle than racial
987900	990900	politics because you you racial
990900	992980	politics can come down to like some
992980	995980	platitude about like you go oh well yeah
995980	997560	I had an epiphany this morning well
997560	999900	brushing my teeth my friends darker skin
999900	1001740	than me that doesn't make him less of a
1001740	1004140	person but you can't see there there are
1004140	1005780	barriers you can't get beyond and you're
1005780	1008660	thinking about women your mom was a
1008660	1011340	woman if you had a wiener and your mom
1011340	1013780	didn't like there may be shit that
1013780	1016220	you're carrying into your adulthood you
1016220	1018060	may be punishing women for shit that
1018060	1019580	you didn't know your you don't know that
1019580	1022020	you're doing it like like they they've
1022020	1025220	they've suffered man what is your
1025220	1026780	relationship with women oh they're
1026780	1030340	beautiful they're a groovy bunch of
1030340	1033060	chicks I don't know I don't I don't know
1033060	1040940	it's totally totally on I proposed to
1040940	1043500	one yeah I know it's totally untapped
1043500	1046100	for me I really don't it's it's on it's
1046140	1050740	uncharted territory like you said I just
1050740	1053380	watched the I watched the the most
1053380	1055180	recent cut of the Harman tour
1055180	1057660	documentary and you talk about the fact
1057660	1060140	that like communicating with anybody any
1060140	1062220	stranger even your friends like it's
1062220	1064380	always a crisis communicating with a
1064380	1069620	stranger extra crisis how comfortable
1069620	1074500	are women more strange to you than other
1074500	1077380	men like like you certainly seem to
1077380	1078700	have a relationship with women that's
1078700	1083900	like like a little more fearful I don't
1083900	1088220	know I I I more fearful than what than a
1088220	1090660	nine-foot tall guy that a four-foot tall
1090660	1093580	guy that a guy in a wheelchair that a guy
1093580	1096020	with a with a with a weird really weird
1096020	1100380	hat on well yeah to the extent that to
1100380	1102020	create balance the guy has to be nine
1102020	1104260	feet tall like like well does what I'm
1104260	1106380	saying no that's that that's the that's
1106380	1109700	the unexplored question of gender
1109700	1112380	because we we have this tendency to
1112380	1116220	simultaneously we we we we talk about
1116220	1118540	the human species is this is just very
1118540	1122300	neatly divided down the middle gender
1122300	1123820	wise there's men and there's women and
1123820	1126820	then we have all of these we have it out
1126820	1130540	politically about race let's say
1130540	1133060	nationality but it within all of these
1133060	1134940	nations and all of these races there's
1134940	1138460	this it's almost like the crime is
1138460	1140900	committed and and finished and gotten
1140900	1143620	away with before it's ever called to
1143620	1146660	court because let's let's face it we we
1146660	1149540	all like are born into a world where
1149540	1152220	we're trained to think about men and
1152220	1158140	women as these that let's say you're in
1158140	1160380	a writers room and there are your equal
1160380	1161980	number in terms of showrunners whatever
1162100	1164500	and there's male writers and female
1164500	1166020	writers do you not have an automatic
1166020	1169020	opinion about like like what like or
1169020	1170780	let's say this is a female writer in
1170780	1173220	your writers room did you carry anything
1173220	1176780	into that yeah if there's one female
1176780	1180260	writer in a room full of 10 male writers
1180260	1185620	I am distracted by how distracting
1185620	1187580	things must be for her I get distracted
1187580	1189940	by that that's why I like I would I
1189940	1192140	would like it to be like half men and
1192140	1195260	half women and it rarely can be so I
1195260	1197460	find myself thinking about the two
1197460	1199060	women for instance season five of
1199060	1202220	community read to to female writers the
1202220	1204980	writers room and I find myself filtering
1204980	1206940	things through their experience are we
1206940	1213620	getting too abrasive are we are I know
1213620	1216540	that female writers are not tender at
1216540	1219860	all that's not what I mean are we but
1219860	1221380	what would this look like on an
1221380	1228700	affidavit later it it it bears thinking
1228700	1231020	and which is why the easiest thing in
1231020	1233100	the world or rather the hardest thing to
1233100	1234860	achieve but then the easiest thing to
1234860	1238940	maintain is half and half represent the
1238940	1240700	species in the writers room so that
1240700	1244740	like every if a single individual male
1244740	1249460	writer has a tendency to thrust his
1249460	1251660	chest out and get abrasive in his
1251660	1254380	language then he's got he's got a
1254380	1256420	proper amount of women to contend with
1256420	1257740	there was the thing I forget what year
1257740	1260060	it was somebody saw me a story about I
1260060	1262060	think there was a like a European Cup
1262060	1264420	championship like soccer like like
1264420	1267220	football proper football and it was in
1267220	1269060	the Netherlands and I forget what team
1269060	1270420	what countries were playing I think it
1270420	1273220	was held in the Netherlands and the Dutch
1273220	1275540	police did a genius thing there's two
1275540	1276900	countries that hate each other and tend
1276900	1278940	to get pretty violent the two two
1278940	1280420	different countries like their fans get
1280420	1284140	a little hooligan hooligan II and they
1284140	1287820	all the cops they put out women out in
1287820	1290660	the streets all Dutch female police as
1290660	1292180	this is the story I'm telling like you
1292180	1294660	know like the seventh hand but like no
1294660	1296140	fighting because there was just a bunch
1296140	1298940	of women police out there and nobody did
1298940	1302700	anything nobody wanted to fight and and
1302700	1304140	he was like he didn't know if it was
1304140	1305340	because they all wanted a picture with
1305340	1307860	them because they were all like hey
1308620	1310540	history but one is like that's like no
1310540	1312260	like you just you just eliminated the
1312260	1314220	fact that if you added more guys to that
1314220	1318260	angsty like like like wound up to
1318260	1320540	testosterone a environment if you added
1320540	1322380	more guys with more agendas and more
1322380	1325300	weapons on them not going to help you
1325300	1326660	just you just put a bunch of women in
1326660	1329340	the mix and tempers it because the idea
1329340	1330820	that you have a thousand guys in the
1330820	1332340	fucking building together that have
1332340	1334020	like agenda is going to be a fucking
1334020	1335700	bummer and it was like the greatest
1335700	1337980	moments in police force history of just
1337980	1339700	saying like let's just have some like
1339700	1341900	some some femininity out there and cool
1341900	1344380	out everything the fuck out yeah but you
1344380	1346780	can defend somebody like so quick by
1346780	1348820	talking about that like like like the
1348820	1350260	idea that they have a gender identity
1350260	1352180	that they that they put those women out
1352180	1353300	there and that that had any kind of
1353300	1354580	effect for any kind of we wouldn't do it
1354580	1356500	here because because they would they
1356500	1358340	would like we'd be afraid that they get
1358340	1359740	punched or something terrible what
1359740	1361060	happened I think they just did it
1361060	1362460	because they had the idea that it would
1362460	1364500	cool everything cool everything down I
1364620	1368620	don't know look it up everybody
1370620	1373620	interesting to me because like we all
1373620	1377420	know we all know for a fact we all know
1377420	1379220	for an absolute fair and get at it we
1379220	1381900	need some women on stage
1385380	1391660	hello I I was squirming backstage
1391660	1396620	because the reason why I initially
1396620	1400100	really fell for you was was your Dan
1400100	1407060	was it was your what what you what you
1407060	1410460	said to me regarding how you how you
1410460	1414980	felt about women and their I said they
1414980	1419900	were thanks you you said to me that like
1419980	1423220	that that men were so violently opposed
1423220	1428180	to funny men were opposed to to funny
1428180	1433660	women because they they hated women
1433660	1435140	because they're so threatened by them
1435140	1438460	because it was because women were so
1438460	1442420	dynamic and emotional and interesting
1442420	1448460	and confident and weird and and men had
1448460	1450940	a hard time with that you're making it
1450940	1452220	sound like a guy that just wanted to get
1452220	1458300	laid I remember that yeah yeah sure I
1458300	1461940	don't know and Dan said Dan said hey I
1461940	1466060	think maybe I hate women which which
1466060	1468620	obviously I was like turned off by but
1468620	1473820	not but but not but someone saying like
1473820	1475740	I think I hate women but I think I hate
1475740	1477380	them because I love them I think I hate
1477380	1478940	them because I want to be them because
1478940	1481100	I because I admire them because I think
1481100	1484940	that they're amazing and I am upset by
1484940	1487980	that and that was like that was that was
1487980	1491740	it but okay so gender is obviously the
1491740	1494140	theme of the show tonight I think is
1494140	1497660	important good yeah great if we if we go
1497660	1501580	to the moon okay it's it's easy not at
1501580	1504220	the risk of offending any of our
1504660	1509980	listeners of color well and is it gender
1509980	1514340	or is it sex I don't well I mean I don't
1514340	1518100	know Dan just made it race somehow but
1518100	1521700	race is easy race is easy yeah we've
1521700	1526260	proven that as a country what do you
1526260	1528220	give us 500 years we'll figure it out I
1528220	1530740	know I know that if you go to the moon
1530740	1532180	and you want to start a new perfect
1532180	1533780	civilization I know that you make the
1533780	1535860	road straight no you disagree on that
1535860	1537660	you want a scenic view you want it
1537660	1539940	blah blah blah I'm saying on the moon
1539940	1541260	they're gonna tend to be straight there's
1541260	1543740	less I want to do certain logical things
1543740	1546300	if I take a group of people to the moon
1546300	1548300	and I started are you saying the roads
1548300	1549780	are gonna have to be straight and a
1549780	1551460	grid the whole all over the don't get
1551460	1553460	too distracted by that the big reveal is
1553460	1555260	that Dan and I got engaged but Jeff and
1555260	1560220	Dan got married I'm just saying that when
1560220	1563020	one fantasizes when one expresses their
1563220	1565500	their impulse and this is a healthy
1565500	1568060	impulse to everyone in the audience ask
1568060	1570140	yourself what would you do if you could
1570140	1572060	start from scratch because then you might
1572060	1573500	even actually be able to make a couple
1573500	1576780	of things happen down here so what would
1576780	1582300	you do about gender what is it incumbent
1582300	1585660	upon us because it's very very easy to
1585660	1589660	talk about race fact our nation was
1589660	1596260	built on slavery fact most of the non
1596260	1599940	caucasoid Americans who the African
1599940	1601420	Americans as we call them which I think
1601420	1603420	is a ridiculous phrase that the
1603420	1606780	descendants of a practice called slavery
1606780	1609620	which is not too long ago where we built
1609620	1612820	the entire country on them and then we
1612820	1615620	went okay we feel bad about this also
1615620	1617460	it's technologically appropriate let's
1617460	1620100	now let's let's let's leave this into
1620100	1622900	society these are these are easy facts
1622900	1625300	to deal with and you can easily deal
1625300	1626900	with them even though you can't easily
1626900	1628300	deal with them politically and
1628300	1630420	economically you can easily deal with
1630420	1632540	them philosophically by saying such
1632540	1635940	simple no one can argue with them things
1635940	1642900	like ah color who cares easy easy peasy
1642900	1645580	so as far as gender do you mean gender
1645580	1648220	is not easy right but like what but are
1648220	1649420	you talking about the way that the
1649420	1651460	gent that the government would address
1651460	1654140	gender as far as like restrooms kind of
1654140	1658260	well I don't know yeah looking back for
1658260	1659900	a very very long time and what we
1659900	1663620	consider like wow civilization it's been
1663620	1665820	it's been gross white dudes controlling
1665820	1669380	shit and women are have been pushed out
1669380	1671380	of all fucking conversation at all times
1671380	1674660	in the times when I have like like for
1674660	1676500	instance I've been on some like on a
1676500	1678300	television show where there's been run
1678300	1681180	by all men and the men on the there were
1681180	1682740	the writers and the producers and the
1682740	1684940	camera so I get you hear arguments and
1684940	1686380	you hear a bunch of fucking bullshit all
1686380	1688060	day long I've also been in shows where
1688060	1689620	the front line was women women were the
1689620	1692860	director's camera like first ad's and
1692860	1694460	stuff like that no fucking bullshit
1694460	1696300	communication they all fucking dealt
1696300	1697860	with stuff there was there was no less
1697860	1700940	problems and no less like stakes they
1700940	1702380	just managed to deal with it in a much
1702380	1704900	cooler way I think you should involve
1704900	1707100	women way more and instead of letting a
1707100	1710100	bunch of guys like run everything
1710100	1711740	because it's gross and icky and a bunch
1711740	1713100	of fucking cock fighting all the time
1713100	1716620	sure that will protest too much but I
1716620	1718660	protest too much about what well
1718660	1723940	obviously yeah I'm not a hero for saying
1723940	1725820	that it's just ridiculous the idea that
1725820	1728620	that all of our statues are a bunch of
1728620	1730140	a bunch of dudes and when we ever put a
1730140	1731860	woman on a coin it's ironic like it's
1731860	1735860	fucking hilarious like it's we live in
1735860	1740860	a needlessly male world it's so stupid
1740860	1751220	but okay but do you actually like is
1751220	1755020	there okay fantasize in your head we're
1755020	1757340	landing on a unicorn we're landing on
1757340	1759820	the moon tomorrow right there's a rocket
1759820	1763260	ship full of 100 people let's assume
1763260	1766220	let's assume 50 men and 50 women let's
1766220	1768580	assume that we're splitting it down the
1768580	1770540	middle I don't know if I'm making a
1770540	1773260	mistake assuming that but it's a hundred
1773260	1776060	people 50 men 50 women biologically
1776060	1780620	51 40 men when we're going to set up a
1780620	1783660	school we're going to teach children
1783660	1786780	we're going to that there's going to be
1786780	1789300	a new generation after we land on the
1789300	1791700	moon and we pitch our tents and we do
1791700	1795100	our thing the idea is that the following
1795100	1797500	generation is going to have a chance of
1797500	1799980	being wiped clean of all kinds of shit
1799980	1801660	because that's all we've been trying to
1801660	1804180	do down here forever with our funerals
1804180	1807740	for various words and our our letters
1807740	1810860	to TV guide and our fucking like like
1810860	1814100	we we fantasize about a clean slate and
1814100	1816260	there's no better clean slate than a
1816260	1818660	colony where you just take a select
1818660	1821900	group of people and just go okay so what
1821900	1823100	are we gonna what are we gonna teach
1823100	1826940	these kids about are we gonna outlaw
1826940	1831620	gender projection well that that's my
1831620	1833620	question do you mean like sexually it's
1833620	1835940	it's 50 men and 50 women or do you mean
1835940	1838580	gender-wise it's 50 men and 50 women
1838580	1840700	before we even get into that you I think
1840700	1842420	you're talking about the LA perspective
1842420	1843900	where it's like our ten of these people
1843900	1845380	people that are men that identify as
1845380	1847380	women and blah blah blah but but I'm
1847420	1851300	saying like let's just start simple when
1851300	1854820	we're teaching them the alphabet when
1854820	1857060	we're when we're when we're giving them
1857060	1862100	toys are we are we going to commit to
1862100	1864140	the idea that children need to be
1864140	1867980	programmed and are we how do we we know
1867980	1870140	how to do that racially we know that you
1870140	1872660	just don't make children racist we know
1872660	1875580	that you just simply don't program
1875580	1878300	children with racism but we don't know
1878300	1881980	yet how to not program children with
1881980	1885620	gender politics we don't understand what
1885620	1887540	that means I don't understand what that
1887540	1889900	means what would you do in a neutral
1889900	1895660	sterile kind of colony would you is it
1895660	1898420	are there are there pitfalls that you
1898420	1902260	avoid kids like toys what do you do you
1902260	1904980	do you have to give them general gender
1904980	1909740	neutral toys do kids do kids start to
1909740	1913340	express gender I've I listened to stories
1913340	1917460	on NPR about kids expressing their their
1917460	1921060	gender and it's when it's in an ironic
1921060	1923660	capacity when the kid is like like oh
1923660	1926740	well we we wanted to support him and but
1926740	1929540	he wanted to do the thing and blah blah
1929540	1931620	blah like like like we don't know what
1931620	1933380	what is politically correct right now
1933380	1939980	do we right yeah I think that real
1939980	1942140	answer we're really going to the moon
1942140	1943900	and we're really figuring this stuff out
1943900	1947860	I think that I would which I think is
1947860	1949580	what most parents do is just follow
1949580	1952660	whatever their kids want I don't think
1952660	1955620	that my parents my parents were great
1955620	1956740	but I don't think that they were
1956740	1959220	progressive in any way and I know that
1959220	1961220	when I was growing up I played with a
1961460	1964540	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles within a
1964540	1968940	Barbie house but with no Barbies and
1968940	1971380	would I'm not sure when you but when we
1971380	1973340	know I think that but like the the real
1973340	1974980	answer like if we're first sending
1974980	1976300	everyone to the moon and it and
1976300	1978380	everyone gets a kit and it's like a bag
1978380	1982780	of KitKat bars that's a terrible idea
1982780	1987980	there's a bag of weedabix and cucumbers
1987980	1991100	and tomatoes and eggs and then
1991100	1992780	for the kids it would just be like a
1992780	1995140	burlap sack that would have matchback
1995140	1998700	cars matchbacks cars but also treasure
1998700	2005300	trolls and dolls I mean it's not the
2005300	2007180	real answer is that that like that's not
2007180	2009020	that big of a deal because like every
2009020	2011580	that doesn't mean that doesn't identify
2011580	2015900	anyone's sexuality like what toys you
2015900	2018300	play with but making them available to
2018300	2020300	everyone I'm sorry
2020300	2022580	we're engaged you can't stop it
2022580	2025100	I want to bring Camille out
2025100	2026700	let's bring Camille out
2026700	2028700	get his perspective as well
2028700	2030700	Camille
2030700	2032700	Camille
2032700	2034940	who we should really be bringing out is
2034940	2036700	Camille's wife Emily
2036700	2038700	she specializes in this stuff
2038700	2040500	she's not here yeah she had to drop me off
2040500	2042700	that sucks she does specialize in this stuff
2042700	2044700	but she thinks about these things for a living right
2044700	2046460	yeah she tells me about it but I don't
2046460	2052260	listen we're having fun it is by the way
2052260	2054420	is was that book you guys reading those
2054420	2058100	Daniel Quinn yeah why why I know what
2058100	2060740	you know Daniel Quinn I just read one of
2060740	2063660	his books in college and I hated it I
2063660	2067100	hated it so much it's called Ishmael was
2067100	2069380	his book oh yeah he refers to it in his
2069380	2071300	in that book yeah no he's up his own ass
2071300	2075220	it's I don't get a topic but Ishmael is
2075220	2077020	about this gorilla that teaches this
2077020	2078700	guy like the right way to live and
2078700	2080180	civilization is fucked up and it's
2080180	2081980	basically he's sort of advocating that
2081980	2085260	we don't help other countries and just
2085260	2087220	kind of let him die when they get
2087220	2090460	diseases anyway that really that's this
2090460	2095100	guy yeah this piece of see I didn't like
2095100	2098980	the book based on format I like finding
2098980	2100660	out that you don't like him for real
2100660	2102500	reasons yeah there's so much to hate
2102500	2104700	about it I thought it was poetry from
2104700	2107260	far away well it's written and you look
2107260	2108900	at it you think oh it's like he's ee
2108900	2110820	Cummings he doesn't care about format
2110820	2112300	well also the ee Cummings had fucking
2112300	2114980	content also I thought it was the
2114980	2116620	anthropology 101 and everyone else in
2116620	2118700	the class was blown away by this book
2118700	2120980	and how it changed their lives and I
2120980	2123380	really really had such a visceral
2123380	2124740	negative reaction there's a chapter in
2124740	2128020	here that says I bet I'm just saying so
2128020	2129660	Camille are you and Emily gonna have
2129660	2134180	kids start a pry I mean yeah I
2134780	2137660	yeah I hope so unless you know one of
2137660	2142020	the rest of that sentence is with us it's
2142020	2144700	just a new thing well you've heard of
2144700	2149060	these these kid partnerships right no
2149060	2152300	you find another couple who you admire
2152300	2154420	it's like a key party yeah it's like a
2154420	2158020	key but with kids for the night it's
2158020	2164100	called a womb womb blast yeah and you
2164100	2166660	just switch babies no no no no no we
2166660	2169340	just say to you so so Camille and Emily
2169340	2171260	like you guys are having kids yeah you
2171260	2173180	you have your own kid but then after a
2173180	2176100	while it's our kid and our kid is we
2176100	2178820	like it oh it's called a womb blast and
2178820	2181660	and we have parties and we we all hang
2181660	2183100	out together it's basically like a
2183100	2185980	play date but just like forever yeah
2185980	2189700	yeah no but I the reason yes we are I
2189700	2192660	think and if our stuff works we will
2192660	2198620	have a kid yeah so I we we're talking
2198620	2201980	about gender politics politics doesn't
2201980	2205380	even work as a word for the issue at
2205380	2207740	hand I am talking about like what what
2207740	2210820	what does gender mean how how much is
2210820	2212500	gender an artificial construct in a
2212500	2214220	world where we've started to understand
2214220	2215980	that race is an artificial construct
2215980	2218620	look like like how much do we owe it to
2218620	2220260	ourselves to think of gender as an
2220260	2222180	artificial construct I don't give I
2222180	2223700	don't maybe I'm just being thick right
2223700	2225060	now I understand what your hang up is
2225060	2227420	like what's what's like gender roles
2227420	2230100	right yeah my hang up is that in the
2230100	2234180	1950s if you were to take your kid into
2234180	2236940	the garage and close the garage door and
2236940	2241500	train the kid to be racist we now know
2241500	2245380	through the lens of 2014 how to recognize
2245380	2246780	what you're doing right and wrong with
2246780	2249580	the child yeah we can actually in a sort
2249580	2252820	of empirical sense we can define bad
2252820	2255300	child rearing to the extent that you
2255300	2257260	were raising your child to be conscious
2257260	2260060	of race so what's your concern about
2260060	2264260	having a child my question is how now
2264260	2268180	how does that work with gender I Emily
2268180	2271780	has friends they're lesbian and they
2271780	2274180	have a kid and they are raising the baby
2274180	2278700	gender-neutral and how the baby is female
2278700	2280260	and you know the baby has a female name
2280260	2281820	but what they're doing is there's no
2281820	2284220	nothing is blue and nothing is pink and
2284220	2285940	it's not dolls and it's not action
2285940	2288100	figures so the baby's playing with toys
2288100	2291380	that a boy or a girl would could play
2291380	2293900	with but it's hard because they asked
2293900	2296580	you know Emily's mom who's very close to
2296580	2298540	the couple they asked to give the kid
2298540	2300980	gender-neutral stuff and so the mom
2300980	2303620	bought her my mother-in-law and she was
2303620	2305580	trying to she was trying her best she
2305580	2308060	just couldn't she bought her like a
2308060	2311500	flower bow that was purple instead of
2311500	2314260	pink right and she said so purple is
2314260	2316380	like a male color but this is so so
2316380	2320220	let's this is this is a key issue toys
2320220	2324980	are us you walk into it aisle three aisle
2324980	2327340	four aisle five aisle six aisle seven
2327340	2329740	they're not they're based on ages of
2329740	2331460	children they're also based on genders
2331460	2332740	of children I don't know if they've
2332740	2336500	tried like like do you capitalism like
2336500	2339180	do you so if you're a same-sex couple
2339180	2341740	your lesbian friends are having a kid
2341740	2343860	they make the decision we're gonna have
2343860	2346380	a gender-neutral child we're not going to
2346380	2348420	fuck with this child gender-wise we're
2348420	2350940	not going to now they're also in this
2350940	2357580	larger colony yeah sure it's it's
2357580	2360180	impossible to what extent are you the
2360180	2362620	thing is more about not saying because
2362620	2364180	the kid is playing with trucks that
2364180	2366780	they're gay or straight or male or
2366780	2368780	female nobody's doing that to a kid
2368780	2371180	nobody no no some parent might have
2371180	2372420	somewhere out there might be going hey
2372420	2373980	faggot stop playing with that truck I
2373980	2376180	mean I'm sure that's not the right
2376180	2378900	that's a very straight thing to do I
2378900	2381660	mean the fact is very invoked to give
2381660	2383300	kids well things I'm sure they're a kid
2383300	2384900	they're they're kids here I'm sure
2384900	2386940	there are people here who have young
2386940	2390380	children who does anyone here have kids
2390380	2396860	yeah that feels right
2396860	2402140	like the as a nanny in Los Angeles and
2402140	2403500	maybe this is different in other places
2403500	2406580	but like it's it's very uncool to
2406580	2409340	suggest to a child that they should be
2409340	2411220	playing with a certain thing but kids
2411220	2413100	tend to be attracted to one or the other
2413100	2415100	but it doesn't mean anything but I do
2415100	2417260	think it comes from like you said the
2417260	2419500	larger society it's almost impossible to
2419500	2420860	raise a kid completely gender-neutral
2420860	2422900	because as you said there are these sort
2422900	2424380	of roles and things that that's just how
2424380	2428380	it is like give them both things both
2428380	2430140	things there's two things but it's going
2430140	2431620	to be hard even when the kid goes to
2431620	2433980	school and it's like oh the boys oh yeah
2433980	2436140	we're shooting things that murder and
2436140	2437860	the girls play with things that have
2437860	2440900	great shoes you know but that is going
2440900	2442300	to happen I mean we're conditioned when
2442300	2443740	you're a kid look at the fucking
2443860	2446780	commercials for kids toys on TV like
2446780	2449020	it's all sort of you know it's either
2449020	2453300	one or the other and that's really if
2453300	2455140	you're if your little girl is playing
2455140	2456540	with trucks and is talking about
2456540	2459540	murdering cowboys or whatever is to not
2459540	2463380	say well like yeah maybe I'm talking
2463380	2466660	about myself but the thing is to not
2466660	2469140	like the gender quote-unquote gender
2469140	2471580	neutral thing is to not say oh well this
2471580	2473860	child she's a lesbian like at four
2473860	2475420	years old well she's clearly a lesbian
2475420	2477100	she's she likes these trucks she
2477100	2478940	doesn't like these these dolls she
2478940	2481180	whatever it's it's just it's just about
2481180	2483300	allowing kids to do whatever because in
2483300	2487060	the previously when I when a little girl
2487060	2489060	would play with a truck that was bad
2489060	2491500	they would take the truck away and you
2491500	2495460	take your kid through Toys R Us and let
2495460	2498900	the kid yes which is not a crazy no no
2498900	2501420	they get to play with whatever that's
2501420	2503140	this good so you sort of let the kid be
2503140	2506140	the guy the kid is the but we are we are
2506140	2508140	living in within a dichotomy though it's
2508140	2509980	hot yeah and the kid is expressing
2509980	2512020	guided by other stuff other than the
2512020	2513420	parents and it's good that the parents
2513420	2515260	are trying I remember specifically at
2515260	2517420	some point being like I'm gonna learn to
2517420	2520100	walk more manly I remember thinking that
2520100	2521780	and no one told me or made fun of me of
2521780	2523860	the way I walked but I mean look at me
2523860	2527140	walk I walk fucking manly now but I
2527140	2529620	remember that pressure came and it even
2529620	2531180	if nobody tells you it's all there it
2531260	2533740	is a dichotomy Dan and Erin like you
2533740	2535620	guys are engaged you're going to be
2535620	2538300	married probably within the year or so
2538300	2540780	right mm-hmm are you already thinking
2540780	2545460	about kids yes yes yeah is that is that
2545460	2546780	where this comes from any part of this
2546780	2548580	conversation or no no I don't know why
2548580	2550820	we're talking about gender the guy gave
2550820	2555460	a book I don't know okay that guy's not
2555460	2557140	in the crowd is he the guy who wrote
2557300	2561500	that book if he was he left let's say
2561500	2563820	you guys I had a kid and let's say it
2563820	2567460	was pick it random guy or girl guy okay
2567460	2570140	so you had a boy huh what how would you
2570140	2571700	approach that what would be your would
2571700	2574380	you ever slowly carefully I would
2574380	2578700	lovingly fondle his privates with
2578700	2582820	I would kiss his balls what if I let him know that he was
2582820	2585380	great what if it's a girl I would call him
2586260	2587980	as long as you would lovingly follow her
2587980	2589740	privates to like as long as long as a

2597620	2601940	have a million question I I I I I would
2601940	2605180	be very happy with to if I if I was
2605180	2606900	blessed enough that we were able to
2606900	2610980	conceive a child what would your first
2610980	2613420	choice be boy first race first race
2614140	2615860	ice let's say on the kind of you had to
2615860	2619940	pick lately lately I've been thinking
2619940	2628260	I'd rather have a boy because all I
2628260	2632340	could do is be ironic like and and the
2632340	2634100	certain the circumcision issue weighs
2634100	2637060	very heavy on oh yeah that's tough I

2638780	2641460	through that well or my daughter well
2641460	2643140	we could yeah we could take our daughter
2643140	2645500	to Guana and get her circumcised oh I
2645500	2648620	know some places and I feel like same
2648620	2652180	sex children tend to target in puberty
2652180	2656060	they target the same-sex parent I've
2656060	2659060	been reading a lot of Homer I think I
2659060	2661060	like maybe I'm just having a little girl

2697420	2700180	that the way karma works is I will have
2700180	2703580	a kid and he will be very into football
2703580	2705740	I know that but there's nothing wrong
2705740	2707460	with that I think and I'm fine it's fine
2707460	2709140	I wasn't ever going to psyched about
2709140	2711580	football like already I'm like psycing

2713380	2715540	sake and I'll never I swear to God I'll
2715540	2718940	never he'll never see a typewriter he
2718940	2720300	won't be able to read because they don't
2720300	2722300	exist anymore wasn't it'll be a little
2722300	2726420	secret I keep I felt afraid and on many
2726420	2732060	occasions of having a girl yeah you
2732060	2735660	should they're terrible see now we're
2735660	2739140	getting to it they're terrifying people
2739140	2745700	well they love their dads well not
2745700	2748260	necessarily shout out to my dad who I
2748260	2753300	love very much who very much wants to
2753300	2756820	perform our wedding and perform at your
2756820	2758820	wedding or perform no because my dad is
2758820	2762820	a preacher he wants to yeah yeah he wants
2762820	2765100	to officiate the wedding yes and we will
2765100	2768020	not allow him to officiate the wedding
2768020	2770700	because he's so great because you don't
2770700	2772980	want he's he's so good at being a
2772980	2776020	wedding officiant that you don't I've
2776020	2778740	always felt since I was very young when
2778740	2781180	my dad would randomly say like well
2781180	2783900	perform your wedding I've always felt
2783900	2786780	really weird about perform yeah you
2786780	2789820	perform like a right my dad has
2789820	2792180	performed hundreds of wedding all right
2792180	2796980	so hey if you have a kid really quick on
2796980	2800660	this subject and I'm so sorry but I was
2800660	2803980	a nanny in LA for many years not a
2803980	2806780	parent but the gender thing like it
2806780	2810220	becomes really unimportant like yeah in
2810220	2811940	LA when everyone's rich and everyone
2811940	2813060	could do whatever they want no I'm
2813060	2814580	talking about you starting it we're
2814580	2817860	starting a colony how do you how do you
2817860	2819420	approach things logically I'm saying
2819420	2821460	what's the right thing to do we're all
2821460	2822980	well aware as Adam Goldberg very
2822980	2825060	succinctly said we're in LA it's been
2825060	2828700	cool to be gay here for 80 years we do
2828700	2830860	live in a bit of a bubble progressively
2830860	2833780	speaking I think the thing is to detach
2833780	2837100	gender identity from trucks and dolls
2837100	2839300	and whatever because everyone is like
2839300	2841700	little kids are attracted so many
2841700	2843500	different things and it doesn't mean any
2843500	2849620	sort of thing okay but okay so and the
2849620	2852100	bottom line is that the kid like that
2852100	2855540	you kind of you take a bifurcated
2855540	2859740	approach you buy a dump truck and a
2859740	2861700	Barbie doll and you put them in front of
2861700	2863940	them oh no are you get also board games
2863940	2866740	you know like I think I don't think
2867460	2869940	you know in my head that was the most
2869940	2871660	general neutral spring I could think of
2871660	2874980	everyone's jigsaw puzzles jigsaw puzzles
2874980	2877700	yeah well like my brother and my
2877700	2879340	brother bill and his wife Jill they have
2879340	2885020	bill and Jill that's unfortunate mother's
2885020	2888020	name was still no mother's name was
2888020	2891220	Phil no my mother's name was uh was
2891220	2892700	Betty Ann Larson and she married Dwayne
2892700	2895700	Davis she became Betty Davis and it's
2895860	2900420	a grand diva but like my uh my brother
2900420	2904860	and his wife my sister-in-law they raised
2904860	2907220	their daughter they didn't want to give
2907220	2909220	her princess costumes before she was too
2909220	2911980	old to choose them like no no no like
2911980	2914940	overtly girly stuff as time has
2914940	2917620	passed Maddox my niece has just
2917620	2919860	absolutely on her own she doesn't watch
2919860	2921740	TV she doesn't watch any commercials she
2921740	2923380	has never watched TV she does not know
2923380	2925300	like they asked her what do you offer
2925300	2926700	Christmas she was or for your birthday
2926700	2928940	she's she just turned five they said
2928940	2933060	what do you want just a new water bottle
2933060	2935580	water to take to school because she
2935580	2937540	doesn't she doesn't watch she's not
2937540	2939780	inundated with with advertising practical
2939780	2941100	that says you should you should have
2941100	2943020	this ridiculous thing or this this
2943020	2945060	incredibly sure feminine thing or male
2945060	2947740	thing or whatever the fuck but on her
2947740	2950740	own terms I she has started dressing up
2950740	2952260	like princesses and fairies because
2952260	2954460	she's into that and that was never put
2954460	2956500	on her she has just gravitated towards
2956500	2958740	costumes and what they made for her for
2958740	2960700	her fifth birthday was a big wardrobe
2960700	2963100	and they filled it with costumes gender
2963100	2965720	neutral male female this cowboys cow
2965720	2972260	girls princesses ever water like they
2972260	2974860	listen to her that they gave her
2974860	2978180	latitude and gradually she became she's
2978180	2980020	a very advanced like she was advanced
2980020	2981300	two-year-old she's advanced three and
2981300	2983260	four and five-year-old she she very
2983260	2985300	clearly made her own decisions about
2985300	2987980	what she would like to walk around I
2987980	2990740	bet if we didn't get make kids choose I
2990740	2993300	think I know I would have chosen a
2993300	2994980	dress to like it there's so much
2994980	2996900	prettier they're pretty yeah so look at
2996900	2999660	those eyelashes holy shit I know right
2999660	3002780	my mother very clearly I mean I really
3002780	3004540	feel like my mother was was hoped that I
3004540	3006620	was a girl because she had two girls in
3006620	3008180	her first marriage and then she had
3008180	3009660	then she married my dad and there was
3009660	3012060	my brother was the firstborn in that
3012060	3014740	marriage was a boy he was my father's
3014740	3016540	boy more and then when my when I came
3016540	3018460	along I really feel like I was supposed
3018460	3020420	to be a girl yeah so much much of my
3020420	3021980	childhood was spent dressed in tights and
3021980	3023380	dancing and doing things like that I
3023380	3025020	really feel like I ought to have been a
3025020	3026660	girl is probably mom was I didn't get it
3026660	3028540	out of my system until I came here and
3028540	3031100	my first three halloween I dressed as a
3031100	3033380	woman that's that was my costume where
3033380	3035420	were the costume just woman just me
3035420	3038700	wearing a gown lady I was just a lady
3039340	3043660	in a frat way because they're always frat
3043660	3046700	guys who are dressing as girls I felt
3046700	3049340	very pretty I didn't I didn't feel like a
3049340	3052340	frat guy no frat element you know what
3052340	3054940	I mean there's a thing like I when I
3054940	3057220	was in like high school college there's
3057220	3059580	a thing where girls love to put me in
3059580	3062100	women's clothing and it was like they
3062100	3064220	just like to dress certain friends of
3064220	3065700	theirs up but I got they always love to
3065700	3067300	put me in women's clothing I was always
3067300	3070340	totally fine with a turn on right if it
3070340	3072100	look if it's if it's a turn on for them
3072100	3074220	like it's it's fine like it didn't really
3074220	3075780	ever mean anything to me I didn't do it
3075780	3077700	on my own but however I love dressing up
3077700	3079060	as a woman it's great it's fucking if
3079060	3084380	it feels fine like but you I just don't
3084380	3087460	see why you would force it on what's the
3087460	3089100	point of like putting on a child that
3089100	3090660	doesn't idea that you have to do one
3090660	3091900	way or the other anyone would do an
3091900	3094620	intentional intentional I mean like look
3094620	3096500	I would do it like I grew up in Los
3096500	3098220	Angeles I was taught how to throw up my
3098220	3099820	my dad taught me how to throw a curve
3099820	3102700	ball and a change-up and a and a slider
3102700	3104020	and all this stuff and I learned how to
3104020	3106180	do all this manly stuff also I was
3106180	3108700	dancing I got so much femininity and so
3108700	3110740	much masculinity and not in any dogmatic
3110740	3114460	way neither side I you know I I'm the
3114460	3117140	product of a very Los Angeles lifestyle
3117140	3118540	grip because you're doing all those
3118540	3120340	plays and because you're in the King and
3120340	3122340	I did your at did your dad ever do any
3122340	3125620	sort of like hey no I mean I I had
3125620	3127740	friends when I was four years old I had
3127740	3129500	there was a guy that directed the first
3129500	3131660	play I was in he was very clearly even
3131660	3133340	to a four-year-old me I knew that he was
3133340	3136220	a queen he was a big flouncy Oscar
3136220	3138740	Wildy like like awesome like grand
3138740	3142060	theater queer he was awesome and he was
3142060	3144220	my my mother's friend throughout her
3144220	3146340	entire life until she died and he was a
3146340	3147860	part of my life and I grew up in the
3147860	3148980	theater and they were clearly people
3148980	3151060	that before I knew what sexuality was
3151060	3152700	before I never had an erection before I
3152700	3154100	knew what what the difference between
3154100	3156500	male and female anatomy was I didn't
3156500	3158380	know that there were people in my life
3158380	3161980	that weren't the way I was supposed to
3161980	3163580	be my parents weren't dogmatic about it
3163580	3165740	I became the most homophobic person in
3165740	3167700	the world because of the theater
3167700	3170540	because I my parents weren't homophobic
3170540	3172820	my parents weren't dogmatic but I and I
3172820	3173820	feel like I must have talked about this
3173820	3177820	in the show before maybe not I was nine
3177820	3180140	years old or even younger I had dressers
3180140	3183500	and they were the great like like late
3183500	3185820	70s early 80s Queens and they'd make out
3185820	3187300	with in front of each other with each
3187300	3189140	other in front of me and I asked my
3189140	3191100	hairdresser when I was like nine or ten
3191100	3192940	your hairdresser would make out in front
3192940	3194980	of you yeah we're getting celebrate
3194980	3197020	putting we're getting terrible haircuts
3197020	3199660	no you're getting you're getting made up
3199660	3202140	before before play oh like like so I was
3202140	3204340	on Broadway it was ten years old and I
3204340	3206260	had a dresser and a hairdresser wait
3206260	3208740	what you're on Broadway yeah we've talked
3208740	3212460	about yeah no I did not know this with
3212460	3216100	the old Brenner what is your life so I
3216100	3217740	was I was I was I was the king and I
3217740	3219860	was your Brenner when I was a kid and I
3219860	3224100	saw it that's fucking crazy with you'll
3224100	3226100	Brenner yes yeah Camille you've never
3226100	3230100	seen a sexier kid shit so I had this
3230100	3231620	dresser named Gordon who was great and
3231620	3234620	and he was so funny and he would like
3234620	3236100	the costumes are really hard to get
3236100	3237300	out of there's like tons of hooks and
3237300	3238380	snaps and shit like that they're all
3238380	3240980	these old really ridiculous old costumes
3240980	3243500	and then his a guy that he was kind of
3243500	3245380	dating was his hairdresser guy that
3245380	3246580	would come in and they were just like
3246580	3248100	French kiss in front of me and I was 10
3248100	3251700	and then 11 and I asked the younger guy
3251700	3253540	who's probably like in his mid 20s I
3253540	3255900	said like so did you know you're a gay
3255900	3257940	all the time I did you always know you're
3257940	3259260	gonna be gay goes oh no no I didn't know
3259260	3263100	until I was 18 I was like oh don't say
3263100	3266100	that that could say you always knew
3266100	3268220	because not not that I felt like I was
3268220	3270020	ever gonna get punched or beaten or or
3270020	3272780	ostracized if I did grow up to be like
3272780	3276700	a good like 70% of the people on that
3276700	3279540	production were gay and sadly and
3279540	3282060	absolutely truly almost all of them debt
3282060	3284700	because I from AIDS like because I was
3284700	3286020	just well I mean that was a big yeah
3286020	3289140	this was the like the early days of that
3289140	3292900	what was it 80s yeah this is 84 85 I was
3292900	3294620	in that show and like like most of that
3294620	3297860	production is gone including I think
3297860	3300100	these guys and that's why I this guy
3300100	3301460	told me like no like I thought I was
3301460	3303540	straight until I was 18 I got so
3303540	3305060	homophobic and so worried about that
3305060	3307900	only because of my like being gay is
3307900	3310180	hard I'm sure well yeah and you wouldn't
3310180	3312180	choose it as a young boy with like I
3312180	3313740	can I was literally taken off the
3313740	3315980	pictures mound to go audition for the
3315980	3318340	king and I embarrassingly so by my mom
3318340	3321180	and so I when I went home at night and I
3321180	3323060	or if the last thing I did before into
3323060	3324500	bed was close a magazine and it was a
3324500	3326300	picture of a guy I would keep looking
3326300	3328940	until there was a picture of a woman
3328940	3331300	and but to the point of like like like
3331300	3333700	mania and if I was watching TV I would
3333700	3335780	turn the TV off right last I was a guy
3335780	3337900	fuck it turn it back on and wait until
3337900	3339500	there's a picture of a woman because if
3339500	3341340	the last image in my mind was a picture
3341340	3344380	of a man that being straight or gay was
3344380	3347660	this toss of the coin and I maybe that's
3347660	3349460	what that guy did he turned the TV off
3349460	3353420	when it was a guy and a well as an he
3353420	3357220	turned gay as a 10 or 11 year old
3357220	3358900	that's that that was the world that I
3358900	3360660	thought we lived in and then one day
3360660	3362780	when I was 12 years old like laying in
3362780	3367580	bed I just went oh I like women yeah and
3367580	3370420	went to bed and never did that again but
3370420	3371780	that wasn't because anybody told or
3371780	3373380	beat it out of me or whatever but it
3373380	3374740	wasn't like there was a big point in my
3374740	3376140	life where I felt like I really have to
3376140	3378060	do come to grips with the fact that like
3378060	3379980	I might not know this until I'm much
3379980	3382140	older than I am right now and that will
3382140	3383860	be okay but it won't be okay because
3383860	3385460	it's fucking hard you'll get you get
3385460	3387380	treating like shit treat her like shit
3387380	3389340	you'll get you get pushed around well
3389340	3390620	this is something you're able to
3390620	3394100	articulate at the age of 40 looking back
3394100	3396420	on it because it's as clean cut as
3396420	3398740	straight versus gay and that's what I'm
3398740	3401380	talking about because we're entering a
3401380	3403020	world now where we're becoming
3403020	3406020	increasingly conscious of the pressures
3406020	3411180	of gender identity and it's not as
3411500	3414260	clean cut as straight or gay with gender
3414260	3416700	identity you don't know how feminine
3416700	3418660	you're allowed to be or supposed to be
3418660	3420900	or how masculine you're allowed to be
3420900	3422580	or supposed to be this isn't about
3422580	3424660	straighter gay straighter gay comes
3424660	3427260	down to it's that's that's our struggle
3427260	3429260	to turn gender politics into something
3429260	3431740	as clean cut as racial politics because
3431740	3434860	your skin is brown or your skin is white
3434860	3438580	and you had sex with a man and put your
3438580	3441500	mouth on his penis or you didn't there
3441500	3445180	are we have friends of harm in town who
3445180	3450220	come up here who look like dudes and act
3450220	3452900	like dudes and identify as women in
3452900	3454540	their hearts and their minds and it's
3454540	3457540	it's it's incumbent upon us I'm just
3457540	3459380	curious as a guy who's thinking about
3459380	3461420	having a kid in this new world and also
3461420	3463500	as a philosophical thought exercise I'm
3463500	3466460	asking the question like it doesn't like
3466460	3468700	like look what goes through the young
3468700	3470900	brain yeah look what carries through to
3470900	3473340	the 40 year old adult about when you
3473340	3476140	felt like gender was being projected on
3476140	3478820	to you your your sexual roles and stuff
3478820	3481980	I went to the in the King and I
3481980	3483260	dressing room there was the dancers
3483260	3484300	dressing room there was the women's
3484300	3486380	dressing room for the dancers the
3486380	3488220	chorus and the men's and I would say
3488220	3490740	there's probably about 20 or 25 a piece
3490740	3492860	and the men's dressing room there were
3492860	3494860	only a couple straight guys in that most
3494860	3496500	most of the dancers were gay guys and
3496500	3499860	they always had kind of ironically in
3499860	3501620	wherever we traveled we did like 13
3501620	3504140	cities together there'd be a there'd be
3504140	3505660	two calendars next to each other one was
3505660	3507340	a calendar of all like like hot like
3507340	3509700	firemen and like like like naked dudes
3509700	3512580	and then one of naked women but it was
3512580	3515580	only for one or two guys sure and it was
3515580	3517100	like always like it like they did it
3517100	3521020	like out of equality and so I was I was
3521020	3522900	ten years old and my friend my under
3522900	3525220	study Luke where we went down under
3525220	3529500	study I had that's fucking crazy I had
3529500	3530980	seven understudies because they wouldn't
3530980	3532740	they wouldn't let us not do the show
3532740	3534580	that's a whole other story they would
3534580	3536060	like even when I was sick I chipped a
3536060	3537740	whole front tooth off and I was I lost
3537740	3539660	my voice they would not let you not go
3539660	3541100	on even though you wanted your
3541100	3542540	understanding to go do it they wouldn't
3542540	3544900	let the you were just so good no they
3544900	3546460	did they were they just had this weird
3546460	3547900	climate of they did not want the
3547900	3549780	understudies to go out there he was also
3549780	3552060	Camille have you seen a picture of Jeff
3552060	3556620	as a kid no I mean I'm scared is there
3556620	3558220	anybody in the audience I wouldn't
3558220	3559500	imagine I wasn't doing the story real
3559500	3561740	quick so I walked in with Luke down
3561740	3563860	there we were looking at the he and I
3563860	3566660	were both looking at the only like we
3566660	3568300	weren't exposed to a lot of pictures of
3568300	3569900	naked women so we saw these calendars
3569900	3571980	it was right next to a like like naked
3571980	3573340	guys and then there was the naked girls
3573340	3574900	and we're looking at them and there was
3574900	3577100	a dude in the fucking cast god bless him
3577100	3580620	Hawaiian guy named Kaipo who was just as
3580620	3582980	gay as a day in May he was so fucking
3582980	3585140	but he would always kind of harangue us
3585140	3587700	but and he's like hello Jeff I know which
3587700	3589620	calendar you're really looking at like
3589620	3594220	I think I think I'm fucking ten and he
3594220	3595740	gave me a fucking lighter one time he
3595740	3597060	and this dude Stanley give me a fucking
3597060	3598580	lighter and hit a lighter cover like
3598580	3600340	there's a regular big lighter but it was
3600340	3604020	a inserted into a penis that you could
3604020	3606060	flip the head of the penis off and open
3606060	3608180	like and light the cigarette and then
3608180	3610140	came I was like Jeff could you get this
3610140	3611860	out I can't get it out it's stuck and
3611860	3613060	then he just sat there and watch I
3613060	3614660	didn't get the joke I was just
3614660	3617460	struggling with this fake plastic penis
3617460	3620620	trying to and they sat there giggling
3620620	3622220	and then like halfway through I'm like
3622220	3625700	are you motherfuckers like like it was
3625700	3627220	it was the theater they treat you like
3627220	3629060	an adult but it was fucking open season
3629060	3632220	on sexuality there yeah I feel like for
3632220	3633980	me having I think having a kid is so
3633980	3635780	scary anyway I think you do the best you
3635780	3639260	can and I mean it's a job everybody has
3639260	3641260	wonderful parents right and we all have
3641260	3642820	problems with them we're all signing up
3642820	3645020	for a job that no one in history has
3645020	3648180	ever nailed no one's ever gotten it
3648180	3650020	exactly right and we're like yeah we're
3650020	3651420	gonna fucking try we're gonna be the
3651420	3653980	ones you know it's crazy is Christmas
3653980	3658100	shopping at Target and walking down the
3658100	3661420	aisles I was just I was looking for a
3661420	3663900	catchphrase game because we were gender
3663900	3669100	neutral toy yeah and just seeing because
3669100	3671020	all my friends who have kids are are
3671020	3672940	raising their kids quote-unquote
3672940	3675100	general gender neutral which I guess
3675100	3676660	just means letting your kid follow
3676660	3678340	whatever they they'd like which I think
3678340	3681340	most most parents do but the the the
3681340	3685940	rose for for girls pink pink like really
3685940	3687660	yeah it's crazy and then the rose for
3687660	3689980	for boys are black and blue like they're
3689980	3691940	they really feels like you have to
3691940	3695620	choose between the it's so strong I
3695620	3698540	remember always my life until I was like
3698540	3700820	in my 20s being very obsessed with
3700820	3702780	seeming masculine and I was like a
3702780	3704980	little kid I was skinny show us the
3704980	3712620	walk show us the walk I remember I was
3712620	3714860	like the key to having a good walk is to
3714860	3717100	act like it you don't give a shit when
3717100	3719100	your walk looks like so I would give a
3719100	3721740	shit about having a walk that looked
3721740	3723420	like I didn't give a shit do you know
3723420	3726140	how old are you I was probably 12 or
3726140	3728580	something when I was 8 I felt like I
3728580	3730580	was too masculine so I created a laugh
3730580	3733780	that was more feminine yeah yeah let's
3733780	3737940	hear it oh well have you seen a loony
3737940	3739940	tunes yeah have you seen the loony tunes
3739940	3741740	which when when she leaves she leaves
3741740	3744700	her I saw that and I thought that was a
3744700	3751220	height of femininity so my so my laughs
3751220	3756860	that I created was really I remember
3756860	3759660	there's a dude Eugene who was like the
3759660	3763300	funniest dude in seventh grade and then
3763300	3765940	he he went away for the summer and then
3765940	3767940	he came back and he decided that he was
3767940	3769740	gonna be like Eddie Murphy and he had
3769740	3774020	affected this laugh I was so bummed out
3774020	3776940	because Eugene was so funny such a nerdy
3776940	3778660	funny dude and then he came back all
3778660	3781100	sexy drenched in cologne doing this
3781100	3784460	Eddie Murphy laugh is there anybody in
3784460	3786620	our audience and it's fine if the answer
3786620	3790100	is no let it let it let it slide a little
3790100	3792060	we'll bring up Spencer and we'll we'll
3792060	3794020	continue to have a great evening but I'm
3794020	3797700	just curious like you know in this Los
3797700	3799980	Angeles audience is there anybody that
3799980	3803980	can speak from the surf of gender
3803980	3808220	there's somebody that's had a discomforting
3808220	3810100	upbringing like somebody that can talk
3810100	3814140	about it the the this you know give us
3814140	3815780	give us more information than we have
3815780	3818340	because we've been pontificating about
3818340	3820380	how you're supposed to raise a kid and
3820380	3821820	what you're supposed to imprint on them
3821820	3823580	gender-wise is there anybody out there
3823580	3826580	that that sort of you know went back and
3826580	3831260	forth or existed in between you know had
3831260	3835620	a weird experience or anybody that
3835620	3837180	wants to is willing to come up and talk
3837180	3838580	about it you're willing and willing to
3838700	3840140	willing to come up and speak for a
3840140	3853460	little bit yeah coming up I I've never
3853460	3857100	had like a gender identity crisis with
3857100	3858580	myself but I feel like my parents did
3858580	3860420	like they didn't think I was girly enough
3860420	3862260	my mom was really upset because I didn't
3862260	3863180	want to wear makeup and things like that
3863180	3866340	but this whole conversation I've kind of
3866340	3871460	been hearing that it feels to you like
3871460	3873940	gender neutrality is something that you
3873940	3876020	have to work for with a kid and it's
3876020	3877380	sort of like the opposite of the default
3877380	3881260	which is trucks and dolls but the the
3881260	3883300	gender system in my view the gender
3883300	3885460	system that we have is just as much of a
3885460	3887980	construct as making something gender
3887980	3890460	neutral just like it's beyond trucks and
3890460	3892420	dolls like it manifests like gender
3892420	3894140	neutrality would also be an artificial
3894140	3896700	construct yeah but that gives more
3896700	3899180	choice because the gender system we have
3899180	3902100	now takes that choice away and the
3902100	3904140	problem that I have with with the gender
3904140	3905700	system we have now is not just like okay
3905700	3908020	maybe if you let a boy not know he's a
3908020	3910060	boy or what being a boy means maybe he'll
3910060	3911700	want to play with guns and trucks anyway
3911700	3913500	and a lot of little boys do but it
3913500	3915060	manifests in like everything in your
3915060	3916820	life like I'm constantly coming up
3916820	3918660	against this like realization that I
3918660	3919780	don't think I can do something because
3919780	3922100	I'm a girl uh-huh even though I'm fully
3922100	3925580	aware of that and like just one example
3925580	3928260	that I can't stop thinking about is this
3928260	3929460	motherfucker with his feet on the stage
3929460	3932460	like that's not like something you think
3932460	3933780	if you did that as a girl you're
3933780	3935260	thinking like somebody would go hey
3935260	3937020	bitch get your feet off the stage I
3937020	3939060	think about I think that about him
3939060	3943780	constantly he is way out of line putting
3943780	3945900	his feet on the stage I would never see
3945900	3948860	a girl do that no matter how like no
3948860	3950580	matter how pink Anatoly shoes are
3950580	3952580	they're still all over us he doesn't
3952580	3954100	he's Russia that's a whole different
3954100	3956180	thing and it feels very phallic yeah
3956180	3960780	continue that's that's it it's just it's
3960780	3962780	things like that and and you know just
3962780	3963940	kind of thinking like man why you don't
3963940	3965060	know why don't I feel like I can do a
3965060	3967100	thing because and then I realized and
3967100	3969420	then it makes a real difference seeing
3969420	3972660	people that look like you do stuff you
3972660	3974620	want to do sorry may I ask how old you
3974620	3977900	are 23 cool Sarah said when you see in
3977900	3979340	her new special has this great quote I'm
3979340	3980820	just gonna say it she said don't tell
3980820	3982300	little girls they can do whatever they
3982300	3984820	want to do because they would never have
3984820	3986460	occurred to them that they couldn't and
3986460	3988940	I think just having to tell girls that
3988940	3990140	they could be like whatever they want to
3990140	3993060	be comes from such a place of you know
3993060	3994580	where there are certain things that you
3994580	3996860	feel don't you don't feel comfortable
3996860	4000060	doing when you say when you say people
4000060	4002580	that look like you what what does that
4002580	4005060	mean to you it means gender means sex
4005060	4006620	means race means everything and it's it's
4006620	4008580	a it's a kind of thing we're like again
4008580	4009780	I don't I don't consciously think about
4009780	4011220	all the time like when I look at a
4011220	4013060	stage and there's only men on it I don't
4013060	4015620	usually think like oh man it's all men
4015620	4017140	they don't look like me but then if a
4017140	4020140	woman comes on stage I feel relieved and
4020140	4021780	I didn't realize that I was holding my
4021780	4024460	breath mm-hmm that's how I feel where
4024460	4027140	were you raised in in the Bay Area in
4027140	4028700	the Bay Area okay and that's pretty
4028700	4031100	progressive progressive place so sorry
4031100	4035020	do you get bummed out when sometimes I
4035020	4037380	just do you do you come to the show a
4037380	4039260	lot oh this is my second time I just
4039260	4042700	moved here cool
4044860	4047020	do you ever because I feel self-conscious
4047020	4049220	about this do you ever feel bummed out
4049220	4051940	that I just talk about being a girl or
4051940	4055260	kind of like no I'm so glad all right
4055260	4061780	it's just it's feels feels weird to you
4061780	4063260	know it would have been really weird if
4063260	4064660	they had this whole discussion and you
4064660	4068860	think what is been glaring really do you
4068860	4070180	think that when you look back on your
4070180	4073420	childhood do you think about so you're
4073420	4075460	raised in the Bay Area by parents who are
4075460	4078060	where they what were they trying to do
4078060	4081420	gender-wise to you were they were they
4081420	4083340	on a mission they were just trying to do
4083340	4085620	what they thought was normal which is
4085620	4088580	what everybody else is trying to do but
4088580	4091020	it was like I remember I always just
4091020	4092380	wanted cuz I have an older brother and I
4092380	4093580	just always wanted to do everything you
4093580	4095060	want to do my parents didn't really put
4095060	4098220	much on me until you know like puberty
4098220	4100780	and then they were like you know like
4100780	4102260	they just thought it was weird that I
4102260	4104140	didn't hang out with boys that they
4104140	4106100	didn't see I don't know everything that
4106100	4107700	was when it started to kids cuz they
4107700	4108820	were like alright you're a kid whatever
4108820	4111660	play with blocks but then after a while
4111660	4114780	I began to see concern with them and I
4114780	4116380	didn't really understand why did they
4116380	4117940	ever discourage you from doing anything
4117940	4120340	that was like gender-exclusive no they
4120340	4125620	just thought I was autistic not no it
4125620	4127100	wasn't it wasn't gender they we had a
4127100	4129020	lot of problems but not most of them were
4129020	4131740	not gender-related right yeah my mom was
4131740	4133380	very like I thought I was raising you to
4133380	4135180	be a feminist and like when she would
4135180	4136420	do things she didn't think she would
4136420	4137660	kind of use like I thought you were
4137660	4138980	supposed to be a strong woman I was like
4138980	4142380	I think I think in a way maybe this is
4142380	4144820	totally wrong but I but I feel like for
4144820	4147180	for girls it's a little more weird
4147180	4151260	because the girl things are so girly
4151260	4154300	they're so babies are so pink houses
4154300	4156380	they're so everything whereas boys like
4156380	4159620	their trucks and their their models and
4159620	4161060	all these different things so like it
4161060	4164380	for girls it's a little weirder to but I
4164380	4166780	also think girls get to have a little
4166780	4168260	more variance like a little girl
4168260	4169620	playing with a truck is okay but a
4169620	4171300	little boy playing with a yeah no you're
4171300	4172740	right you're right yeah that's totally
4172740	4176940	that's totally crack well God I feel
4176940	4179620	like the deck is stacked against girls
4179620	4185180	a little more because if a boy a boy
4185180	4188380	doesn't have to put on a pink chiffon
4188380	4191900	dress in his upbringing in order to be
4191900	4196980	perceived as being less masculine like
4196980	4201620	a boy gets more leeway a boy is allowed
4201620	4205700	to be for instance smart a nerd like I
4205700	4207940	feel like I feel like if a girl like
4207940	4210820	Mary Curie I feel like if she was like
4210820	4212780	more interested in looking through a
4212780	4216300	microscope then her coming out party I
4216300	4218100	feel like she gets more punished than
4218100	4219780	her male counterpart that that is true
4219780	4223740	I mean it's being a guy is the best yeah
4223740	4226460	I mean it's so everything's in our
4226460	4229020	favor we're all very familiar with the
4229020	4230740	term Tom boy but we don't have the same
4230740	4233700	thing for exactly that's my point my
4233700	4237420	my niece's fifth birthday party like in
4237420	4240060	December she has all these costumes and
4240060	4241580	most of them are little girl costumes
4241580	4244220	and so because of her and so there was a
4244220	4247020	there were a bunch of other kids there
4247020	4249540	but they were all but one of them was
4249540	4251900	whether they were boys so there was four
4251900	4254420	boys there and there was only there was
4254420	4256780	only one male like outfit to put on so
4256780	4259260	all of the guys were running around
4259260	4260980	dressed like Cinderella and princesses
4260980	4262940	and shit and I felt great and the thing
4262940	4265140	is not nobody gave a shit the parents
4265140	4266740	that there's a moment like like there's
4266740	4267860	a moment like okay this is the first
4267860	4269500	time anybody's ever seen anything like
4269500	4271060	this but although all the little boys
4271060	4272140	are running around these four and five
4272140	4273700	year old six year old boys we're all
4273700	4275260	running around dressed like Pocahontas
4275260	4277460	and shit it was hilarious and they all
4277460	4279180	like and like they didn't give a fuck
4279180	4280500	yeah because they're playing they're
4280500	4282300	playing Cowboys Indians but if you're if
4282300	4284820	you're a little girl and you go into
4284820	4287260	your brother's like things and it's all
4287260	4288900	Cowboys and Indians stuff you're not the
4288900	4290660	little girls aren't allowed to dress up
4290660	4292340	like a cowboy or an Indian they have to
4292340	4293620	they have to dress up like a damsel
4293620	4295980	whatever but it was all the parents were
4295980	4298660	sitting around just watching my niece
4298660	4301180	Maddox enforced and all the men all the
4301180	4304140	boys dressed up in these princess outfits
4304140	4305740	and nobody gave a fuck and it was like
4305740	4307860	everybody just like everyone's shoulders
4307860	4309260	relaxed and go like okay it's all gonna
4309260	4311740	be alright because like this is as it
4311740	4314700	should be and it and it was nobody was
4314700	4316940	enforcing anything and the boys didn't
4316940	4318860	lose any credit or money each other or
4319580	4321860	anybody Emily worked at this facility
4321860	4323860	and I don't want to say what was but it
4323860	4325180	was like one for because she's a
4325180	4327260	therapist it was for like bad kids but
4327260	4329540	these were like bad kids like 13 year
4329540	4331180	olds would stab people and like done a
4331180	4332420	bunch of drugs and stuff so they were
4332420	4334460	all like sort of very obsessed with
4334460	4336860	seeming like you know hard and tough and
4336860	4339580	because it was all just guys there they
4339580	4341620	were the kids would end up like fucking
4341620	4343300	each other and then they would have
4343300	4345900	these sort of crises they would come to
4345900	4347540	Emily be like I think I'm gay and I'm
4347540	4349180	gonna be like well not necessarily you
4349180	4351620	might be but also just you know you you
4351620	4354660	just have to get this out one time she
4354660	4357300	heard these two kids were snuggling and
4357300	4358380	they weren't allowed to go home for
4358380	4360820	Christmas as these two like really rough
4360820	4363540	and tumble like 14 year olds and she
4363540	4364940	heard them whisper one guy said to the
4364940	4368940	other he said Merry Christmas baby and I
4368940	4370940	think that's what they sort of was it
4370940	4374180	Lou Rawls it became yeah it became a
4374180	4376300	safe environment to kind of do whatever
4376300	4378500	they wanted to do and not have to have
4378500	4380220	a label on it you know and I think that
4380220	4383220	sort of was weirdly kind of freeing for
4383220	4386740	them yeah I think I think you you were
4386740	4389860	100% right when you say that it's not
4389860	4393940	it's not cool for boys to be girly but
4393940	4396940	boys are really rewarded for being funny
4396940	4400340	and goofy and sure like putting on girls
4400340	4402700	outfits and whatever else like it's not
4402700	4405180	like for girls just talking a lot yeah
4405180	4406740	they were just talking a lot it sounds
4406740	4408420	like Sarah had the same sorry I had the
4408420	4410820	same experience that I did where the
4410820	4413580	parents were kind of panicked over the
4413580	4416340	way that you were interacting with the
4416340	4420380	world and we're worried that like you
4420380	4422020	weren't going to be I know I know for
4422020	4423980	sure like my mom had a an actual
4423980	4426660	conversation with me that was about me
4426660	4428900	not being pretty enough or like me not
4428900	4431220	being pretty or losing weight or etc
4431220	4433300	etc like everyone feels really panicked
4433300	4434740	when they see a girl playing with trucks
4434740	4436140	because it's like oh my god like their
4436140	4439140	value like what is there and also like
4439140	4441860	not be true now as much especially not
4441860	4443620	but it still is I mean when was the last
4443620	4445700	time you heard a guy being called mouthy
4445700	4448140	you know you don't really hear that but
4448140	4450140	there's these certain words that are that
4450140	4452180	are sort of they're so ingrained and they
4452180	4455500	are used to sort of denigrate women you
4455500	4457340	know like Emily this will happen all the
4457340	4458740	time Emily and I host this video game
4458740	4460020	podcast it's called the indoor kids
4460020	4462500	listen to it it's great but whenever I
4462500	4465180	fuck up a video game fact they say
4465180	4467300	Emily fucked up a video game it always
4467300	4469740	goes on her every single time and they
4469740	4471980	also tell her to relax all the time
4471980	4474300	which like fucking drives me nuts but
4474300	4476220	that's another thing like the way Emily
4476220	4481020	is a bitch she is a mouthy bitch no
4481020	4483460	Emily Emily is 100% it's interesting
4483460	4485700	because there you notice there aren't
4485700	4487700	any equivalence you know how they're
4487700	4492100	out like a you know racially like you
4492100	4495460	have the n-word you have you have the
4495460	4498860	height of profanity when there's a group
4498860	4501180	that is not part of the ownership class
4501180	4504340	and then we joke about how there's no
4504340	4505780	what are you gonna call us a cracker
4505780	4508420	honky does it those words don't matter
4508420	4509780	it doesn't work because there is no
4509780	4512460	there is no you can call the you could
4512460	4514780	say bitch you can say the C word sure
4514780	4517020	you could say there's there's like five
4517020	4520100	words that you can use to to indicate
4520100	4523340	that a woman is is that a line yeah and
4523340	4526780	when a guy is really out of line it's
4526780	4529020	the same words because you're impugned
4529020	4533100	their gender yeah I I I am the biggest
4533100	4539340	offender of that like I I I I emasculation
4539340	4543420	when you really really really disapprove
4543420	4546660	of a fella yeah like I like I like I
4546660	4549100	find myself emasculating that
4549100	4552220	linguistically yes that they are a C
4552220	4554380	word that they are a T word that they
4554380	4558420	are what's the T word twat I don't think
4558420	4560140	it's not enough that you could just say
4560140	4562980	T word and we know what you're talking
4562980	4566020	about I thought it was titty titty face
4566020	4569780	I went with titty titty what do you do
4569780	4571940	the from from there you get into
4571940	4574260	homophobia you could call a guy a cocksuck
4574260	4575620	yeah then Dan what does that mean when
4575620	4577220	you say that to a woman what does that
4577220	4580180	mean what do you know well I mean if
4580180	4581980	it's about emasculation well it's the
4581980	4583380	same as the n-word it means you're
4583380	4585380	dehumanizing them if you call a woman a
4585380	4587420	C word you're and if you call a guy the
4587420	4591020	C word you're making it like a woman which is the worst thing you can say
4591020	4594020	yeah well they just say it all the time
4594020	4599420	stop being a yeah anyways you're probably
4599420	4602540	uncomfortable standing up here can I say
4602540	4604780	something of course it down please I'll
4604780	4606860	get off you've earned it I promised my
4606860	4608540	friend Eric that if I got up and got to

4643420	4646500	parents from some other place I don't

4650140	4653380	Sarah you're Irani okay your parents got
4653380	4657060	away from the Islamic Revolution nice
4657060	4660700	did you speak Farsi a little bit did you
4660700	4664660	grow up here you see we made you sit
4664660	4668420	down that we start interview again how
4668420	4671060	sexist is that sit down we'll talk you
4671060	4673380	from a distance it's not a good show
4673380	4676500	that's not a good show by applause how
4676500	4678220	many how many girls here had kind of
4678220	4679900	like a similar experience where their
4679900	4685740	parents were weird about their yeah
4685740	4687620	humble applause our parents did that to
4687620	4690900	us once you get that I'm sure a bunch of
4690900	4694660	the guys here yeah like like I'm not I'm
4694660	4695940	not I'm not I'm not dismissing him
4695940	4698020	saying like that's a thing gender
4698020	4700180	politics what is it I remember like what
4700180	4702460	my high school once you invite Hasbro
4702460	4708820	and Mattel into and like like like
4708820	4711220	you're there oh they only mean well
4711220	4715100	they're not going to try they don't mean
4715100	4717780	well Mattel does not mean well that's
4717780	4721300	that's well I could argue that that's
4721300	4724300	that they do mean well like when you
4724300	4727980	entrust a system like capitalism into
4727980	4730220	something organic like your gender
4730220	4734580	identity you can guarantee one thing
4734580	4739060	Parker Brothers and Mattel and and and
4739060	4741660	these companies they're definitely going
4741660	4743740	to go where the heat is they have no
4743740	4747700	interest in informing your gender
4747700	4750660	identity based on some glass ceiling
4750660	4752660	that they want to maintain they want to
4752660	4755580	make money and if they think that little
4755580	4758020	boys like to shoot things and make them
4758020	4762180	bleed they're going to become part of a
4762180	4765700	cycle that makes little boys feel like
4765700	4768420	they want to make things bleed but I
4768420	4770300	also think that if when you're a kid
4770300	4772740	like labeling yourself is sort of a
4772740	4774540	powerful thing you're figuring out who
4774540	4775940	you are you figure out your identity and
4775940	4778820	it is easier like to be like I'm a
4778820	4780940	straight male I'm a manly male I like
4780940	4782740	sports you know what I mean it's it's
4782740	4785020	much harder when it's fluid so I know
4785020	4787100	that that's a good goal to have but for
4787100	4789380	kids that can be a little it's a little
4789380	4792220	more challenging yeah yeah that's what
4792220	4794620	I'm saying like you don't look to your
4794620	4796820	fucking Saturday morning cartoon you
4796820	4798900	don't even look to your goddamn parents
4798900	4803700	I'm sorry like I like they're a wash in
4803700	4809020	this shit like the it everyone's
4809020	4812100	confused and if you if you look to who
4812100	4814980	came before you for what you should do
4814980	4817420	on your 13th birthday and what you
4817420	4818660	should wear and what you should be
4818660	4820220	playing with what you should be doing
4820220	4823340	you're you're you might get a little bit
4823340	4824860	of truth but you're probably gonna get a
4824860	4828580	lot of misinformation and and and and
4828580	4830980	parents I wonder there's a parent's
4830980	4833220	responsibility is to do the best they
4833220	4836740	can I guess within this maelstrom to
4836740	4839380	make sure that there's I think it's just
4839380	4842420	a smorgasbord there's also like the
4842420	4844420	because it not because there's a right
4844420	4846180	or wrong way to do it just because like
4846180	4847740	you said someone said earlier that we
4847740	4849900	everybody got it wrong there's nobody
4849900	4851300	yeah nobody's nobody's ever been
4851300	4852340	convicted of being of the world's
4852340	4855340	perfect parent you could try so right
4855340	4858220	so hard to make things gender neutral
4858220	4859820	that you absolutely create more
4859820	4861660	confusion that there needs to be fuck
4861660	4864060	you get up that way too yeah holy crap
4864060	4865940	it's somebody who's a nanny in LA
4865940	4868180	working with kids who grew up with a
4868180	4870540	lot of money there's there's there's the
4870540	4873700	oppression if I've told the story a
4873700	4875420	thousand times of my this is such a
4875420	4877580	classic story like me being a kid grew
4877580	4881420	up the 70s my mom sitting down with me I
4881420	4884860	was playing with the it was Sesame
4884860	4887980	Street figures like and Sesame Street
4887980	4890500	was already it was a you know
4890500	4893020	multiracial environment and stuff so
4893020	4894300	they were like these little figures
4894300	4896540	that were different colors and my mom
4896540	4899580	I remember my mom saying can you tell me
4899580	4901420	the difference between this guy and this
4901420	4905700	guy and I I went a guy who's got a hat
4905700	4907340	on that guy doesn't have a hat on and
4907340	4908940	she's like really that's the only
4908940	4913340	difference and I said yeah well this
4913340	4916460	shirt's different and my mom I
4916460	4921380	remember her going that is so great
4921380	4925140	that you don't see the difference
4925140	4927060	between them because the real difference
4927060	4930860	is that this guy's black and this guy's
4930860	4933700	white and you are part of a new
4933700	4936820	generation that will not perceive race
4936820	4941140	until otherwise notified this is exactly
4941140	4946460	your origin story my was the same mom
4946460	4949460	who came and sat on the foot of my bed
4949460	4952740	because there was a there was a miniseries
4952740	4954820	on TV and I remember her coming into my
4954820	4956660	room and waking me up and sitting on the
4956660	4959060	foot of my bed and saying I'm waking you
4959060	4962900	up and telling you there is going to
4962900	4966300	come a day when people tell you that
4966300	4968180	something called the Holocaust never
4968180	4974900	happened it did happen it happened they
4974900	4979100	tried to kill all the Jews I don't care
4979100	4981700	who I don't care who says what what
4981700	4984060	evidence they present you the most well
4984060	4987380	meaning how can you get more
4987380	4989820	progressive than that that story so so
4989820	4991460	funny because it sounds like it just
4991460	4994580	occurred to her it did it did just
4994580	4996460	occurred to her because my mother
4996460	5000100	realized things when the television said
5000100	5006500	that that's why I'm here because I am
5006500	5010700	like an apocalypto like I I've climbed up
5010700	5012820	to the top of the fucking pyramid like
5012820	5015060	the thing that told my mom what to think
5015060	5018740	on Wednesday I would say god damn it I
5018740	5020380	don't want to wash the dishes and she'd
5020380	5022700	slap me and say you don't say god damn
5022700	5024860	it no one says god damn it that's the
5024860	5027620	Lord's name in vain Thursday night Johnny
5027620	5030500	Carson god damn it this fucking Burbank
5030500	5034500	weather ha ha ha but mom I gotta well
5034500	5038900	Johnny Carson said it so fuck it I gotta
5038900	5041660	get out to where this world makes this
5041660	5043940	television I am going to control
5043940	5046820	people's thoughts I am going to become
5046820	5049340	a real person well you had to get out to
5049340	5051220	television where it was fine because it
5051220	5052860	because you were on television because
5052860	5056860	it's where you make dumb people think
5056860	5061180	period let's bring out Spencer everybody
5074380	5077420	I got a new chair that's what we're
5077420	5082860	talking about now paradigm shift it's
5082860	5086900	not folding I don't like it you like the
5086900	5088500	folding you don't like this one I don't
5088500	5091140	know about it are you afraid of change
5091140	5094580	though there's a pillow on it there's a
5094580	5097700	pillow on your chair was are you saying
5097700	5100100	are you saying that my butt ate the
5100100	5102620	pillow what are you saying no I wasn't
5102620	5106220	having none of that Spencer would you
5106220	5108420	agree that like the key to gender
5108420	5110540	neutrality is not putting like not not
5110540	5112540	attributing anything to like male or
5112540	5115100	female it's about whatever it is I mean
5115100	5117460	labels are important to humanity but you
5117460	5120260	can't stay stuck on the labels because
5120260	5121820	they're only as useful as defining the
5121820	5123660	actual thing which is important what
5123660	5125020	was your favorite toy as a child it's a
5125020	5127180	really brave stance by the way the key
5127180	5130900	to gender neutrality is to not imprint
5130900	5136420	any gender on anybody oh really I had
5136420	5139340	been operating under the age old idea
5139340	5141900	that the key to gender neutrality was to
5141900	5145340	imprint male gender on everything I I
5145340	5147420	don't think I articulated what I what I
5147420	5149900	meant very well what I meant was was that
5149900	5152060	like as far as gender neutrality goes
5152060	5154420	we say like oh well play with a truck
5154420	5155660	because that's a boy thing or play with
5155660	5157940	a play with a Barbie house because it's
5157940	5161180	a girl thing it's just like not Jeff's
5161180	5163780	walking across what's happening oh let
5163780	5168940	me go get my character sheets out yeah
5168940	5171100	it turns out the key to gender neutrality
5171100	5173580	is to not pay attention at gender who
5173580	5179740	would have thought I feel like we spent
5179740	5181060	an hour and a half not getting to the
5181060	5182660	bottom of this at all what did you think
5182660	5184580	we would get to the bottom of this in an
5184580	5186020	hour and a half that would be like on
5186020	5188700	CNN front page tomorrow Harman town
5188700	5193220	figures out the gender problem you see
5193220	5194660	what I mean like I think a lesser
5194660	5196620	lesser-minded person would approach
5196620	5198740	gender neutrality by saying like here's
5198740	5200740	a here's a boy thing here's a girl thing
5200740	5203980	as opposed to like not getting beyond
5203980	5205900	like things being boy or girl things
5205900	5207540	like trucks aren't necessarily boy
5207540	5211140	things and houses aren't necessarily I'm
5211140	5214180	killing myself after that I get what
5214180	5215500	you're saying I just don't know what I
5215500	5220420	can do from here at this point Spencer
5220420	5223660	what was your favorite toy as a as a
5223660	5226980	young Spencer Legos I mean I don't know
5226980	5229180	you'd like the dick butt right yeah the
5229180	5232620	dick butt for me it was Legos and
5232620	5234260	Star Wars action figures and that's all
5234260	5236300	I needed that's about building your own
5236300	5239380	universe boys are cooler than girls
5239380	5241940	toys well that's the thing is like well
5241940	5244140	that's the whole it's all about options
5244140	5246220	like why why don't women have powers
5246220	5247740	because their options are limited
5247740	5250500	they're only well that's what power is
5250500	5253300	is having options power is being able to
5253300	5255500	choose your options right if you only
5255500	5257580	have pink toys if you only have the
5257580	5260100	ability to choose pink toys you're being
5260100	5262660	limited boys boys toys don't have a
5262660	5264420	color like you said earlier they're blue
5264420	5266060	or black they're not they're every color
5266060	5268500	you know pink toys are like a girl's
5268500	5271260	toys so it's just about options it's not
5271260	5274020	about saying ones better than the other
5274020	5276900	boys toys have changed and girls toys
5276900	5278700	are still Barbies yeah they really
5278700	5280460	haven't changed much it's all about like
5280460	5285020	emulating a house life yeah right from
5285020	5286380	the girls in the audience was anyone
5286380	5290100	else jealous of boys toys cuz yeah
5290100	5292100	there was more there's more types like
5292100	5296860	more options yeah I was jealous of my
5296860	5299460	nieces toys they're their toys had like
5299460	5300940	because there was an option that I
5300940	5302580	wasn't exposed to I didn't I didn't
5302580	5305220	like that like wait you have little

5507860	5509220	half older than us there was nothing
5509220	5510540	weird about the fact that the Douglas

5567860	5569180	story on the harm intent before when I
5569180	5571220	was like four or five and I'd see my I
5571220	5572860	took a bath with my knees was two years

5574740	5577920	older and I saw the different like
5577920	5580020	plumbing and I emerged into one of my
5580020	5582180	parents fancy pants older cocktail

5651380	5654380	fantastic engineering which okay yeah

5656900	5663420	yeah yeah I will what's happening last
5663420	5666080	time on Harmon town the gang was feeling
5666080	5668260	pretty empty after their victory
5668260	5671100	against Admiral Darkstar maybe it was
5671100	5673020	the fact that the shards of power were
5673020	5675340	still in the wrong hands or maybe it was
5675340	5677340	because Krista Berg kept barfing
5677340	5681020	everywhere and cut off his penis all was
5681020	5684020	not well they encountered their friend
5684020	5685860	Morris Goldbright who made a cameo
5685860	5687620	appearance noticing Krista Berg's
5687620	5690380	strange behavior and a stranger stone
5690380	5693500	that Chris had dropped from his hand the
5693500	5695780	stone burst in at the same time Admiral
5695780	5698000	Darkstar's castle crumbled into a hole
5698000	5700480	in the frozen earth this enraged the
5700480	5702240	rogue and caused him to attack quark
5702240	5704200	quark was having none of that however
5704200	5706120	and brought and threw Krista Berg
5706120	5708680	severed member into the ice hole in
5708680	5710840	response Chris possessed by ghoulish
5710840	5712940	strength hurled quark down into the ice
5712940	5716000	hole himself sharpie left into action and
5716000	5718160	teleported to quark carrying them down
5718160	5720800	safely with his feather fall but down
5720800	5732700	where and down why will so right now
5732700	5734380	sharpie and I are falling down into a

5751840	5757080	and you see the crumbled ruins of the
5757080	5759400	statue or not the statue of the castle
5759400	5760880	that's fallen through the ice hole

5908400	5910280	within maybe 40 feet of the ground
5910280	5912960	before being slowed and propelled by
5912960	5915760	this levitating force that gently drifts
