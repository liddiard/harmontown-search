0	9000	Harman Town is once again in session, everybody.
9000	12000	Oh, yeah.
12000	15000	That's right.
15000	18000	Welcome once again to Hollywood, California, the Nerd Melt Theater.
18000	21000	And thank you for listening out there in Podcast Universe.
21000	24000	Please put your hands together for the groove master,
24000	27000	the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
27000	35000	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, freestyling, freestyling,
35000	43000	rapping wild, rapping wild, freestyling, not rhyming, rapping wild, rapping wild, yo.
43000	46000	Freeform, freestyle.
46000	48000	Freeform, freestyle.
48000	52000	Yo, I saw your mama, saw her the other day, saw your mama,
52000	56000	I supported the gays, I saw your mama, I told her that.
56000	59000	She said, fuck them. What'd you think about that?
59000	64000	Your mama's not an advocate. She doesn't think they should vote or get married.
64000	69000	I said, bitch, it's politically hairy.
69000	74000	You're in California. You got to be open-minded.
74000	78000	And here's what your mama said. She said, you know what?
78000	81000	I didn't find that to be the case.
81000	84000	And she started rattling off all kinds of right-wing bullshit at me.
84000	87000	So I fucked your mama.
87000	89000	Dan Herman, everybody.
89000	94000	That was a little bit of a...
94000	97000	I felt like that was a little bit of a...
97000	100000	I don't know, what do you call that? I felt like it was a little bit of a...
100000	101000	This was experimental.
101000	104000	That was kind of populist smoke, I think I was spewing there.
104000	107000	I knew my crowd. I knew where they land.
107000	110000	I mean, yeah, I think what we're doing right now is, you know,
110000	113000	we have a giant tour coming up that's looming.
113000	116000	And are we recording? I hope you can hear the sound of the crickets
116000	117000	that are in this building.
117000	118000	Actual, literal crickets.
118000	122000	Because if you ever want to really just lay a stinker of a joke out there,
122000	125000	the crickets will be there to add high relief.
125000	127000	I'm kind of excited, and I don't mean this sarcastically.
127000	129000	I really am excited about how already...
129000	136000	I think we just kind of started in earnest to sort of think of this as a movie
136000	138000	that we're going to be shooting about the tour that we're going on.
138000	141000	And the big question is, like, how do you shoot a movie about a tour
141000	142000	that you're going on?
142000	143000	How do you shoot a movie about anything?
143000	145000	If there's no script and all these things, you bring cameras
145000	147000	and you hope not to affect anything.
147000	152000	But it's like already our awesome director, Neil,
152000	154000	who does not want to be spoken about on camera.
154000	156000	So this will not...
156000	157000	He's right over there, everybody.
157000	159000	Ryan, can we get a shot of him?
159000	161000	This will not be in the movie, but he's like Bob Vila already.
161000	164000	But with that camera, he came out and was like, rip that curtain down.
164000	166000	But that curtain is the thing that...
166000	168000	Stand by the light, get over there.
169000	170000	It's good.
170000	174000	I'm more comfortable knowing that I'm in the hands of someone who's not...
174000	179000	If I say something particularly profound by the refrigerator...
179000	180000	Which is almost...
180000	184000	I don't want to find out later that if I had stepped three inches back,
184000	187000	I would have looked awesome and sounded awesome.
187000	189000	So he's like, move.
189000	191000	And it's definitely going to affect everything,
191000	193000	which is kind of an interesting thing.
193000	196000	Because if it wasn't, it would be weird that it wasn't affecting everything.
196000	197000	We had to rip that curtain.
197000	198000	It was starting the show.
198000	200000	That curtain's there to block light from the comic book store,
200000	201000	from spilling into here.
201000	203000	It's also to block your vision of me,
203000	206000	because we go by the bridal rules of what constitutes...
206000	211000	If you see me before the show, the mystique is blown.
211000	215000	Most of you are responding for most of these nights to like,
215000	217000	well, is that what he looks like?
218000	220000	He's so beautiful.
220000	222000	His heart is a rock.
222000	224000	It's his special day.
225000	228000	Apparently that curtain was also there to keep crickets out of the building.
229000	232000	Yeah, I'm a little embarrassed about the crickets.
232000	234000	We have to get a microphone on those crickets,
234000	235000	so we can just add cricket sound.
235000	237000	So you have a lot of art imitating life,
237000	238000	imitating art, imitating things.
238000	240000	It's going to be very exciting to just get in a bus
240000	243000	and go for 20 days and 20 nights.
243000	244000	I never understood that expression.
244000	248000	Why do you have to add that there's nothing that is ever...
248000	251000	Like, what is that from menorah times?
252000	255000	Is there a Jewish thing that happened
255000	258000	where something happened for eight days that didn't happen for eight nights
258000	261000	and that was a miracle and we need to keep track of that
261000	263000	so your bank tells you,
263000	265000	well, this is for eight days and eight nights.
265000	267000	This isn't a fucking menorah.
267000	269000	I'm making up the menorah thing.
269000	271000	I'm just grabbing at something that might have...
271000	274000	See, I always think of it because I got to guest announce
274000	276000	that Price is Right for a couple of months,
276000	279000	and it's you and a guest will go to Cancun, Mexico
279000	282000	for six days and four nights.
282000	285000	Yeah, you're covered on the waterslide parks
285000	288000	for the last two days, but fuck if you're getting a hotel.
288000	290000	That's where the expression comes from.
290000	292000	It's a capitalist expression.
292000	295000	We never had to differentiate days and nights
295000	297000	until they started costing money.
297000	301000	Yeah, six $80 days and four $80 nights.
305000	308000	Out of pocket, you can do whatever you want, Gladys.
310000	313000	That's the typical Price is Right winner, I'm sure.
317000	320000	No, I just do that to hope that I come up with something else to say.
323000	325000	AIDS. AIDS. Who's aware of AIDS?
325000	328000	No, didn't... scraping the barrel.
329000	331000	Who has it?
331000	334000	Boy, those Muppet movies are overrated.
335000	338000	Oh, that new Batman movie stinks.
339000	342000	Oh, what you should be asking yourself
343000	347000	is why a bad guy would sound like this.
349000	351000	Seems counter-tortered.
353000	355000	I realize I'm the last person to see this movie,
355000	357000	and I'm so thankful for that.
358000	359000	What movie are you talking about?
359000	361000	Batman's risings.
362000	364000	That's my new form of protest.
364000	367000	I figured out old people because I'm becoming one of them.
367000	368000	That's why they do it.
368000	370000	They're doing it to fuck with you.
371000	372000	Why are you watching that?
372000	374000	Like you're wearing a Nike shirt.
375000	376000	What are you, Nick?
376000	378000	Is that your name on your shirt?
378000	379000	Nick?
379000	380000	It says Nike.
380000	381000	Nike?
381000	383000	What? It's a kind of shoe.
383000	384000	What, do you work for them?
384000	385000	I don't get it.
385000	386000	I don't get anything.
386000	388000	That's my protest.
388000	390000	It's kind of cool.
391000	393000	It's a lot less energy and a lot more result
393000	396000	because you just thrive on all the young people going,
396000	397000	fuck you!
397000	398000	Fuck you!
398000	400000	No, I could explain it.
400000	401000	Fuck you, old man.
401000	403000	You don't get bubblegum?
404000	405000	Are you going to...
405000	407000	If you're chewing it, why don't you swallow it?
408000	409000	You know what?
409000	411000	I'll wait till you figure it out.
412000	415000	Maybe you'll get your big break one day, bubblegum.
416000	418000	Sounds like a great idea.
418000	419000	Candy, you don't swallow.
419000	420000	Good.
420000	421000	Call me in the morning.
421000	424000	I got to figure out this goddamn Tivo.
425000	427000	Well, if Knight Rider's on when it's on,
427000	428000	why do I got to wait for it?
428000	430000	That's going to be me.
430000	432000	It's already me.
433000	434000	What was I talking about?
435000	436000	AIDS.
436000	437000	AIDS.
437000	439000	It's a bitch AIDS.
439000	440000	It'll kill you.
440000	442000	Flat in seconds.
443000	444000	You were talking about Batman.
444000	447000	And it's contagious through air.
448000	449000	I'm making it up.
449000	451000	Don't listen to me.
451000	453000	Batman sucks also, but hey,
453000	455000	I'm the guy that said you could get AIDS by breathing.
457000	458000	What do I know?
458000	460000	Make your own opinion.
460000	463000	Or if you want to make your opinion based on fear,
463000	465000	listen to this guy.
467000	469000	My name's Bane.
469000	474000	I'm the villain for 90% of Batman Rising.
475000	480000	This is the voice you'll be expected to fear
481000	483000	for most of the movie.
484000	486000	A lot of people have pointed out
486000	489000	that I sound like Daryl Hammond's Sean Connery.
494000	496000	Still others postulate.
496000	500000	I'm a dog poem-era Jimmy Stewart.
501000	505000	In any case, not a villainous sounding man.
506000	508000	Can I hear some villainous dog poem?
508000	512000	Could you do a villain Jimmy Stewart Batman dog poem?
512000	515000	My old friend comes to me
517000	520000	after rabbits chasing dreams.
527000	529000	I reached out,
529000	533000	can still feel his now dead hair.
537000	539000	This is a work in progress.
539000	542000	I'm, I'm workshopping this.
543000	546000	I haven't, I haven't, my dog just died.
546000	549000	Thought you'd appreciate the passion.
549000	551000	If you want something overworked,
551000	554000	go down the street to E.E. Cummings.
557000	560000	It gets to a point where you're using exclamation points
560000	564000	in your poem figure you've been thinking about it too much.
564000	566000	Figured my dog died.
566000	568000	You might want to fucking hear about it.
568000	571000	Fuck me, I'll leave the Tonight Show.
571000	574000	No, uh, no, uh, wild stuff, stay.
576000	578000	Ha ha, yes.
578000	580000	Hey, it's Doc Sepperson.
580000	583000	All of you are out, you're all out.
583000	586000	You're like, what part of Arsenio is this?
586000	589000	That's nostalgia for you, is the woof woofs.
589000	591000	I worshiped Johnny Carson.
591000	593000	I was, I actually pre-date, when I was a kid
593000	595000	and I was watching people perform for people,
595000	597000	my first hero, I believe, was Johnny Carson
597000	599000	in terms of like coming out, talking to people.
599000	601000	And I was right on the bubble,
601000	603000	because like I was probably like,
603000	605000	I'm not going to do this.
606000	608000	And I was right on the bubble, because I was probably
608000	613000	10 or 11 when Letterman like got his show
613000	616000	and it was like this young spry weirdo,
616000	619000	this gap in his teeth and just bright red hair
619000	623000	and wrestling shoes and dunking himself in water
623000	625000	with Alka-Seltzer suits on and stuff.
625000	627000	You guys know the drill, I mean you know,
627000	630000	you're required to know a certain amount of comedy history.
630000	632000	We weren't actually there.
633000	637000	At what I call comedy stock,
637000	640000	just that one episode where he dunked himself
640000	642000	with Alka-Seltzer, it's probably the worst episode
642000	644000	of Letterman ever, I don't know.
644000	646000	Can we get back on track?
646000	648000	I really, I want to streamline tonight,
648000	649000	I don't want to...
649000	650000	Stand target.
650000	653000	I don't want to get off on a lot of tangents tonight.
653000	656000	We have a tour, but I love Johnny Carson
656000	658000	and I used to put on little shows
658000	660000	and I would tap my little pencil
660000	663000	and I had a thermos cup lid and if it was Mother's Day,
663000	665000	instead of giving my mom a Mother's Day gift,
665000	668000	I would put on a Mother's Day show
668000	670000	and I would say the Mother's Day show
670000	672000	and then I would sit there and I would just emulate
672000	674000	Johnny Carson and I would tap my pencil.
674000	677000	My mom's in back right now, just drunk off her.
677000	680000	You can hear her stumbling around.
680000	682000	She did not take to LA well.
682000	685000	She found out there's more than margaritas.
685000	689000	She's six smack sheets to the wind.
689000	691000	I don't know what drug terminology.
691000	693000	I think smack comes in sheets.
693000	696000	Is she a heroine using sailor?
696000	697000	Yeah.
697000	699000	She doesn't mellow.
699000	701000	She just shoots out and listens to Kenny Loggins
701000	704000	on the marina.
704000	706000	So I don't know where I'm going with that.
706000	707000	I used to perform.
707000	709000	And then I realized a certain point,
709000	710000	well this is very difficult.
710000	712000	Oh, was there a documentary crew
712000	713000	stumbling around the chairs maybe?
713000	714000	I don't know.
714000	717000	That's funny too.
718000	719000	We should have a documentary crew
719000	721000	following the documentary crew.
721000	723000	Don't, don't start.
723000	727000	I'll get fired.
727000	728000	Enough of that.
728000	730000	Let's do something for the nice people
730000	732000	for once in a while.
732000	733000	Let's pretend someone's watching
733000	735000	other than a person that makes shows.
735000	739000	You elitist meta asshole.
739000	742000	I don't want to go to the museum
742000	746000	and see paintings of frames.
747000	749000	So clever, Dan Harmon.
749000	751000	You're so goddamn clever.
751000	752000	Oh, a painting of a thing
752000	754000	that's supposed to be around a pan.
754000	756000	Oh, maybe I'm part of that.
756000	758000	Actually, that's pretty cool.
758000	759000	I should give that an M.
759000	760000	What do you think the final product
760000	761000	is going to be?
761000	763000	When you and I have come home,
763000	768000	there's been two attempts in our lives.
768000	770000	We will have gone through a lot together.
770000	772000	What do you think the final product,
772000	773000	I mean obviously it's in the hands
773000	777000	of our shy Neil Berkley director
777000	779000	who doesn't want to be mentioned,
779000	781000	and yet we will persist in mentioning him
781000	782000	as often as possible.
782000	783000	Shy in front of the camera,
783000	786000	but a real George S. Patton behind it.
786000	787000	No, son of a bitch.
787000	789000	No, wow.
789000	792000	This curtain goes.
792000	795000	I had to talk him into doing the movie again
795000	797000	after he came up here.
797000	799000	It took three Amstels to get him
799000	800000	to really actually say,
800000	801000	no, I'm doing it.
801000	802000	Because he came and saw the show.
802000	804000	He had a, yes.
804000	805000	Frankly, yes.
805000	806000	I don't know.
806000	808000	But no, he didn't say as much.
808000	810000	But I'm insecure, obviously.
810000	811000	I think he's insecure.
811000	814000	We're both, like a conversation between two guys
814000	816000	whose job is to try to receive people
816000	817000	and figure them out.
817000	819000	It was like taking two saucers
819000	821000	and trying to make them stick.
821000	827000	It was like, we need the Chinaware equivalent
827000	828000	of a penis in here,
828000	830000	or we need to start mixing metaphors.
831000	832000	But I don't want to insult women
832000	837000	by saying we were two vaginas scissoring.
837000	842000	I just want to edit all this out of the movie.
842000	844000	Also, I think what it all came down to
844000	847000	is I had to promise him, it's your movie.
847000	849000	I'm not the kind of guy that's going to go,
849000	854000	hey, okay, so remember when we got our drive-through food
854000	855000	and it was wrong,
855000	858000	and I just revealed my true feelings
858000	860000	about just all black people?
864000	867000	Is there any way you could change the N-word
867000	872000	to N-word instead of the N-word?
872000	874000	Because it just doesn't, I don't think,
874000	876000	you don't think it's going to make a good movie?
876000	878000	No, I'm sure it'll make a good movie for you,
878000	881000	but I would really like to be able to go back home
881000	882000	and get some markup.
882000	885000	Well, I'm looking at whatever this kind of film
885000	887000	equivalent of a Pulitzer is.
888000	890000	No, but he should be allowed to.
890000	891000	Academy Award, I think they call it.
891000	892000	It must be.
892000	896000	There's got to be some kind of word for a film award.
899000	901000	This is going to work well on the road
901000	904000	when I can't think of what state we're in.
904000	905000	Where are we?
905000	907000	New Mexico and Phoenix, people just get over and rape me.
907000	909000	And also, we're not going to have any time
909000	910000	to be in any of these towns.
910000	912000	We're going to be in Nashville, Tennessee,
912000	914000	and we will have seen nothing.
914000	916000	We will be on stage and we might as well be here.
916000	918000	We should go out in Phoenix on January 10th,
918000	920000	like I'm going to go, okay, think of something
920000	922000	Phoenix-related, get them on your side,
922000	927000	and I'm going to go, hey, birds should stay on fire.
927000	928000	You know what we should do?
928000	931000	They shouldn't be ashes, and they're all going to go...
934000	935000	You know what we should do?
935000	937000	We should think of the list of the cities
937000	938000	that we know we're going to,
938000	941000	ask if anybody here is from there or has lived there,
941000	944000	and get some sweet little local nuggets.
944000	946000	Anybody from Arizona here?
946000	948000	See?
948000	950000	We're going through the curtain of night on this tour.
950000	954000	What I was thinking is, is there a way to train?
954000	955000	Can I train?
955000	957000	The two things that make me the most phobic
957000	959000	are audience reaction.
959000	960000	I'm used to these guys.
960000	962000	They love each other.
962000	963000	They love me.
963000	965000	They're very good people.
965000	966000	And they're racist.
966000	969000	They're from Los Angeles.
969000	971000	We share a culture.
971000	973000	I've lived here for 15 years or more,
973000	975000	and I don't know, they're my people.
975000	977000	We're in the back of a comic book store.
977000	980000	Then something's going to be fundamentally different
980000	983000	besides just barometric pressure, which is a huge thing.
983000	986000	It's not to be quibbled with.
986000	987000	I've been in Denver.
987000	989000	I got a nosebleed at the airport,
989000	992000	and I forgot to take the pot out of my girlfriend's purse,
992000	994000	and we were there for an extra six hours.
994000	998000	It was all because of the little altitude.
998000	999000	And I wasn't performing.
999000	1002000	I was just trying to get some pot back home.
1002000	1005000	Now, do you know that there's a hard, fast rule
1005000	1008000	that you cannot take a shit on the tour bus?
1008000	1009000	You know that, right?
1009000	1010000	That's a rule.
1010000	1014000	I mean, I know that Dave Matthews Band broke that rule.
1014000	1017000	I heard that story about the Dave Matthews Band.
1017000	1019000	I guess there's a hose that comes off the bus.
1019000	1021000	It's like a poop hose that you can just,
1021000	1023000	I don't know, the tour manager just was like,
1023000	1025000	all right, we're breaking a minor rule,
1025000	1027000	but there's so much poop in there.
1027000	1028000	I mean, it's the Dave Matthews Band.
1028000	1029000	They work hard.
1029000	1031000	They poop harder.
1032000	1034000	Oh, I've heard their music.
1034000	1037000	Let's let some of this pressure off.
1037000	1038000	Let's give the kids a break.
1038000	1039000	They've earned it.
1039000	1041000	And they just kind of hit the release valve,
1041000	1044000	and I guess it just sprayed all over some boat passing by
1044000	1047000	where a guy was like, and here's another thing.
1047000	1049000	The Chicago River, they were going over the river,
1049000	1051000	and there was a ferry underneath it,
1051000	1054000	and they emptied it and hit all the people on the bridge.
1054000	1055000	Yes.
1055000	1057000	My description is pretty accurate.
1057000	1060000	She said there was Chicago River, and they were on a bridge,
1060000	1062000	and they dumped it over the bridge, and there was a ferry.
1062000	1064000	It landed on the ferry.
1064000	1068000	Or as I call it, a record release by the Dave Matthews Band.
1070000	1072000	Shit all over your head.
1072000	1075000	They did set one Dave Matthews record.
1075000	1079000	Those people will all be remembering that release for years.
1080000	1084000	Dave Matthews Band and Blue's Traveler can get in a fucking boat and die.
1084000	1086000	Those are the fucking worst.
1086000	1087000	No, no.
1087000	1088000	No.
1088000	1090000	Stand up, Blue's Traveler supporters.
1090000	1091000	Show yourself.
1091000	1092000	Adam Goldberg.
1092000	1093000	I knew it.
1093000	1095000	You fucking...
1095000	1096000	Yeah.
1096000	1097000	Praise from Caesar.
1097000	1100000	Did you see the weird stance that Adam just made?
1100000	1102000	I'm going to do a...
1102000	1105000	I don't know how to differentiate weird from not weird stances with that guy.
1105000	1108000	I'm going to describe it first and then do it.
1108000	1110000	He did...
1110000	1112000	Adam stood up and did that.
1112000	1115000	He stood up for the Dave Matthews Band.
1115000	1117000	And then while people jeered,
1117000	1122000	he did a stance that I'm going to label and diagnose...
1123000	1126000	I'll come up if you want me to come up.
1126000	1128000	He went...
1128000	1133000	So do the Dave Matthews thing and then I'll stand up and be Adam Goldberg and do what he did.
1133000	1136000	Dave Matthews can go fuck themselves.
1137000	1147000	You kind of did like Peter Pan flying, like waiting for the wires to do their trick.
1147000	1149000	Yeah, kind of a...
1149000	1152000	You saved bolts in the starting blocks.
1152000	1153000	Ready to come up?
1153000	1154000	All right.
1154000	1156000	Maybe later, Adam.
1159000	1160000	Wait, so...
1160000	1161000	Dave Matthews...
1161000	1162000	Oh, no.
1162000	1164000	I'm not saying you can't poop on the tour bus
1164000	1167000	because you're not supposed to release it on tourists' heads as you're going over a river.
1167000	1169000	Because then everyone's in the bathroom.
1169000	1172000	No, because you live on a bus and you poop on a bus
1172000	1175000	and it smells like poop forever for the rest of the trip.
1175000	1177000	There's no going backwards from that.
1177000	1180000	You are now living in a Chevron men's restroom.
1180000	1183000	And you're not supposed to do it.
1183000	1185000	You have to ask the driver to pull over and say,
1185000	1187000	I'm going to go make a...
1187000	1189000	Make a tutu.
1189000	1191000	Can you make a tutu?
1191000	1192000	I don't know.
1192000	1195000	We're going to make Saskatchewan by 1300.
1195000	1197000	Tour talk.
1198000	1200000	But I'm going to make a tutu.
1200000	1203000	And a tutu is going to have to make a kuzu.
1203000	1206000	When we get to Flagstaff...
1206000	1210000	He's bounding down, loaded up and trucking.
1210000	1213000	He thinks Saskatchewan's in the U.S.
1214000	1216000	I really am that.
1216000	1217000	I don't...
1218000	1220000	I'm about to take my lack of...
1220000	1222000	Where do you think Saskatchewan is?
1222000	1223000	Do you know where Saskatchewan is?
1223000	1224000	It's in Canada.
1224000	1225000	Where though?
1225000	1226000	Precisely.
1226000	1228000	It's right above the U.S.
1228000	1230000	I've lived here my whole life.
1230000	1231000	I know where Saskatchewan is.
1231000	1232000	My bad.
1232000	1233000	My bad.
1233000	1234000	You go...
1234000	1237000	I was like, Chicago's down, Saskatchewan's up.
1238000	1240000	I'm Milwaukee.
1240000	1242000	But for some reason you go through Michigan,
1242000	1244000	even though that's also down.
1244000	1246000	Where's Belgium?
1246000	1247000	That's...
1247000	1248000	That's...
1249000	1250000	For sure.
1250000	1251000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1252000	1253000	Oh, he's good.
1254000	1255000	Yeah.
1255000	1256000	All right.
1256000	1257000	But if you go west long enough,
1257000	1258000	I also know you can go...
1258000	1260000	Everything's also west.
1260000	1261000	Because it's like Pac-Man.
1261000	1263000	I know that you will...
1263000	1265000	It's not the most efficient thing,
1265000	1267000	but it could be the most strategic in a pinch.
1267000	1269000	You take the tunnel.
1269000	1271000	Sometimes you gotta do it.
1271000	1272000	Pac-Man fans.
1273000	1277000	Didn't you self-anoint yourself as Pac-Man?
1277000	1279000	Wasn't that your nickname for a while?
1279000	1280000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1281000	1283000	In the 80s, how many people...
1283000	1284000	I don't know.
1284000	1285000	You don't have to applaud or anything.
1285000	1286000	But there's a thing...
1286000	1288000	I think this is an American thing,
1288000	1290000	because we're so capitalist
1290000	1292000	and consumerist, whatever you call it,
1292000	1294000	a snobby languages.
1296000	1298000	You are defined by what you consume,
1298000	1302000	and there's not a ton of roller rinks or anything.
1304000	1306000	You start buying...
1306000	1308000	You're like, oh, I'm into She-Ra.
1308000	1309000	That's my thing.
1309000	1310000	I'm the She-Ra person.
1310000	1311000	You look for an identity.
1311000	1312000	I think it's a lot easier.
1312000	1314000	I think that's why kids seem cooler now.
1314000	1315000	It's not just because I'm getting old.
1315000	1318000	It's because they have a subscriber base.
1318000	1320000	They can just be into bands
1320000	1323000	that a normal kid would never have heard of.
1323000	1324000	But now you kind of have to.
1324000	1326000	As a kid, you have to survive.
1326000	1327000	You have to kind of pick through scraps
1327000	1329000	and pick your own bird food.
1329000	1331000	You can't just wait for Mama to...
1331000	1332000	In your mouth.
1333000	1335000	Dave Matthews in your mouth.
1336000	1338000	Can't wait for that tour bus to pull up,
1338000	1341000	put its hose down your little baby bird gullet.
1343000	1344000	That's so great.
1344000	1345000	Hey, guys.
1348000	1349000	You're going to miss us when we're gone.
1349000	1350000	Yeah.
1350000	1351000	Yeah, we'll be back.
1355000	1357000	Are we going to have a triumphant return back here?
1357000	1359000	Our last show should be here, right?
1359000	1361000	That's what Neil was asking in the green room.
1361000	1363000	He was saying, so you're going on tour.
1363000	1366000	Neil who shall remain unnamed.
1367000	1368000	Neil Berkeley filmmaker.
1368000	1370000	Mr. Fly on the Wall.
1371000	1372000	Mr. Wizard.
1372000	1373000	Mr. Dumbledore.
1373000	1375000	Was that the good guy?
1376000	1377000	We went through this.
1377000	1378000	I don't know the first...
1378000	1379000	No tangents.
1379000	1381000	Zero tangent show tonight.
1381000	1382000	Zero tangent show.
1382000	1384000	We got a lot to talk about.
1387000	1389000	He was saying something that was interesting.
1389000	1391000	I was like, do you...
1391000	1393000	You're going out on a big 20 city tour, whatever it is.
1393000	1394000	I keep saying 20.
1394000	1395000	I'm making it up.
1395000	1398000	But you have an opportunity to come up with a theme at the top of it.
1398000	1400000	And I was like, I think he was just...
1400000	1401000	He didn't really mean that.
1401000	1405000	He just knew that that would make me launch into a thing about how the theme wouldn't...
1405000	1408000	We could just have to go out there and do nothing and hope for the best.
1408000	1410000	But then he said...
1410000	1411000	I had not considered.
1411000	1413000	I think this is a valid point.
1413000	1415000	He being my dad, if this is in the movie,
1415000	1417000	will pretend that it wasn't Neil that said this.
1417000	1418000	But I thought it was profound.
1418000	1420000	He said, well, what about these people out here?
1420000	1422000	You're going to be gone for all that time.
1422000	1424000	They're going to be listening to you every night.
1424000	1428000	Because we're going to podcast for taking Dustin Marshall, our producer, with us out there.
1428000	1430000	And we're going to be pumping out the jams every night.
1430000	1434000	I don't expect you to listen to it every night, but...
1434000	1436000	Do you guys like nightly jams?
1436000	1439000	Do you like them pumped out?
1439000	1442000	All over your face, underneath a bridge?
1442000	1444000	That's what we're talking about.
1444000	1446000	We're going to Dave Matthews this show.
1448000	1450000	What a word you say.
1453000	1455000	Don't look up too much.
1459000	1461000	What a fairy trip.
1461000	1462000	Is that one of their songs?
1462000	1463000	I don't know if they got it.
1463000	1465000	When they get these poor people, they start out...
1465000	1467000	If I know my fairy terminology,
1467000	1470000	a fairy takes you from one place to another, so you're like...
1472000	1473000	People are just like,
1473000	1476000	well, there's only one way to get from Racine to Sheboygan.
1477000	1480000	Let's get on this here contraption.
1480000	1482000	So there are people on there with a legitimate...
1482000	1486000	They're like, I drove my car into this thing because I prefer driving, thank you.
1486000	1489000	Oh, Father, stop it.
1489000	1491000	You're just on a boat for a goddamn minute.
1491000	1494000	It's not the Poseidon Adventure. Just relax.
1494000	1497000	I don't know why I can't get in my old station wagon
1497000	1499000	and just drive to Sheboygan.
1499000	1502000	You always do this when we're out.
1502000	1504000	I'm just telling you that change is bad.
1504000	1506000	Oi, brother!
1506000	1509000	What a work you'll save.
1509000	1512000	Into the reborn land.
1512000	1514000	Halt on town, halt here.
1514000	1516000	Halt down in Santa.
1518000	1521000	Because at least if it was ZZ Top shit, I'd be like,
1521000	1523000	yeah, it's kind of cool.
1523000	1524000	Something for dad to enjoy.
1524000	1526000	That was David Lee Roth?
1526000	1527000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1527000	1529000	Oh, all right.
1529000	1532000	Loved Panama, lost my virginity to it.
1533000	1535000	Who's Dave Matthews?
1535000	1537000	Hey, Dad, I'll play something for you.
1537000	1541000	Well, now I got shit on twice.
1544000	1547000	Easy target, easy fish in a barrel.
1547000	1549000	Oh, no, fuck them. They're the worst.
1549000	1552000	You know that they had to, when they saw the newspaper light,
1552000	1556000	they were like, fuck, this is not a good dot for people to be able to connect.
1556000	1560000	We are now famous for taking a shit on people.
1560000	1564000	It's like when you name your show, like, worst show ever.
1564000	1568000	I'm sure everything you and I have said has been well-tilled
1568000	1570000	soiled by comics ever since that happened.
1570000	1573000	I just don't know, but holy fuck.
1573000	1575000	Also, in the same boat accident where they all die,
1575000	1578000	Smash Mouth is in that boat, too.
1578000	1581000	Smash Mouth may automatically go fuck off and disappear forever
1581000	1583000	because they're the worst.
1583000	1587000	Did you ever hear the thing on the YouTubes you can go on?
1587000	1590000	It seems to be systematically like it's getting redacted,
1590000	1592000	but there was a thing.
1592000	1595000	First of all, you can hear David Lee Roth doing,
1595000	1598000	I can't remember what song it is, is it Panama?
1598000	1600000	Is it Panama?
1600000	1602000	And it's David Lee Roth just as vocals.
1602000	1606000	That's a very awkward thing to subject a vocal artist to.
1606000	1608000	That is not there.
1608000	1610000	Nobody wants to be heard that way necessarily,
1610000	1613000	but it just goes to show, like, David Lee Roth's got some pipes.
1613000	1615000	It's amazing. He sounds silly.
1615000	1618000	He's like an amazing, silly man with an amazing, silly throat
1618000	1620000	capable of hitting amazing, silly notes
1620000	1622000	and, like, is totally into his job
1622000	1625000	and got hired for that job for a reason.
1625000	1627000	And there's another one that's exactly like it.
1627000	1630000	That's the Smash Mouth guy, and it's such a fucking, like,
1630000	1632000	it's such a trip. It's such a bummer.
1632000	1635000	If anybody can find that, let's play it.
1635000	1637000	Can anybody pull that up on their phone?
1637000	1639000	We can play it through the mic right now.
1639000	1641000	Nah, don't worry about it. Just Google it.
1641000	1644000	Last week here at The Space, we called Chevy on the phone.
1644000	1646000	Chevy Chase.
1646000	1648000	And asked him if he was coming.
1648000	1649000	Voicemail. Got the voicemail.
1649000	1651000	Yeah, his voicemail left a message asking if he could come
1651000	1653000	play Dungeons and Dragons with us here this week.
1653000	1656000	He called me back promptly the next day
1656000	1658000	and was very, very sweet and cool,
1658000	1662000	and he and I have always gotten along, kind of, in an op.
1662000	1663000	Really?
1663000	1665000	Yeah. I just hated working with him.
1665000	1668000	I just... I tell you, when it comes to, like,
1668000	1670000	understanding a person, like, I've...
1670000	1673000	Ugh, God help me. I've never understood a man better.
1673000	1680000	Just my time with him in the trailer, like, hearing him, like,
1680000	1683000	talk about how my show wasn't funny and stuff like that.
1683000	1686000	In between that stuff, though, he was saying things that I understand.
1686000	1688000	I was like, yeah, I know how you feel.
1688000	1690000	Like, I don't want to die either.
1690000	1692000	Like, I...
1692000	1695000	I want to punch God in the face
1695000	1698000	and everyone that represents his sloppy work, too, you know?
1698000	1700000	I deserve better than this, too.
1701000	1705000	So he and I have always... I mean, honestly, I would...
1705000	1707000	Do you have his voicemail reply?
1707000	1710000	I do use the term loosely, but I would call him a friend.
1710000	1713000	Did you answer the phone or do you have his reply on your phone?
1713000	1716000	Oh, no, no. He and I talked for, like, 20 minutes.
1716000	1718000	I don't think he knows what voicemail is,
1718000	1721000	because I said... I said, did you hear the voicemail?
1721000	1723000	And he said he was going to go listen to it.
1723000	1725000	But I texted him this morning because it was like,
1725000	1727000	but he's in New York. He was going to come.
1727000	1729000	You should know that he's...
1729000	1731000	Well, actually, that bum shot, doesn't it?
1731000	1733000	But...
1733000	1735000	Well, not to throw him under the bus,
1735000	1739000	but the idea of him coming was about as good as it was going to get.
1743000	1745000	I think he would have walked out and he would have gone like,
1745000	1747000	holy shit!
1747000	1749000	And then he would have started talking and he would have been like,
1749000	1751000	shit!
1751000	1754000	Hello, what you say?
1754000	1759000	It's just the layman's opinion.
1759000	1763000	He's said worse about my acumen, so we're even steven.
1763000	1765000	We can both take it.
1765000	1767000	But anyways, I wanted to point that out,
1767000	1769000	the Chevy Chase, after all this.
1769000	1771000	But he may come. He still may come, right?
1771000	1772000	Not tonight.
1772000	1773000	No, no, not tonight, but eventually.
1773000	1776000	Oh, yeah, no. He's more likely to come than anybody,
1776000	1778000	because he's like, I don't know, he loves...
1778000	1780000	I'll tell you one thing about him that's really amazing.
1780000	1783000	He's never been a refuse-nick in terms of like,
1783000	1785000	he loves people loving him,
1785000	1789000	and people who run up to him on the street and just go,
1789000	1791000	holy shit, you were fletched!
1791000	1793000	He does not go, yeah, go fuck yourself.
1793000	1794000	I'm sick of that shit.
1794000	1796000	He goes like, yeah, I was.
1798000	1800000	I was.
1804000	1807000	On the set once, there was a guy making hot dogs,
1807000	1810000	and then he was like, you know, he's like,
1810000	1811000	holy shit, fucking Chevy Chase,
1811000	1814000	give a Chevy Chase a hot dog, man, it's fucking crazy.
1814000	1816000	And I was like, standing in line behind Chevy,
1816000	1819000	going like, ah, come on, don't be tacky hot dog guy, you know?
1819000	1821000	You know the culture, like, treat him like a living ghost,
1821000	1823000	or you might lose your job, you never know.
1823000	1825000	Like, like, like, like half of,
1825000	1827000	90% of the actors might walk away and go like,
1827000	1830000	hot dog vendor acknowledged my fame.
1830000	1832000	Lose it, you know?
1832000	1835000	But Chevy was like, like, I mean, he just plays,
1835000	1837000	like, everything that would be in that guy's fantasy,
1837000	1840000	everything in his head that was telling him,
1840000	1843000	just say something, better that you do than if you don't.
1843000	1846000	Like, Chevy affirms that all the time,
1846000	1848000	and anybody that, like, accosts him.
1848000	1850000	And he was like, he's like, can I call my sister?
1850000	1852000	My sister's not gonna believe this.
1852000	1854000	And I'm like, again, pushing it, come on, you got the thing.
1854000	1857000	Chevy takes the phone and goes like, hey, who is this?
1857000	1858000	What is it?
1858000	1860000	He starts fucking around with the guy's sister.
1860000	1861000	Like, walked away with the phone,
1861000	1863000	talked to her for 20 minutes, came back.
1866000	1870000	The guy was, like, pissing, like, hot dog vendor pee.
1870000	1874000	He was pissing hot, regular urine, they're human.
1874000	1875000	Shame on you.
1875000	1878000	But then, isn't the show...
1878000	1880000	They don't piss hot dogs.
1880000	1883000	They're human beings.
1883000	1886000	This is why I gotta get out of L.A.
1886000	1888000	You guys just immediately think a hot dog winner,
1888000	1890000	I bet they pee hot dogs.
1890000	1893000	No, they vote.
1893000	1894000	Not Nashville, they don't.
1894000	1895000	You're gonna learn that the hard way.
1895000	1897000	No, come on, Nashville's great.
1897000	1899000	Yeah.
1899000	1901000	Just practicing for Nashville, guys.
1901000	1904000	But, like, isn't this show kind of one long call
1904000	1907000	to your friend's, to a stranger's girlfriend?
1907000	1910000	I mean, wouldn't he, like, the non-refusic part of him,
1910000	1911000	wouldn't he love this?
1911000	1914000	No, because he doesn't like the people he works with.
1914000	1915000	He doesn't like...
1915000	1917000	Is that what you're asking?
1917000	1919000	Isn't this a good setup for him?
1919000	1920000	Oh, yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying.
1920000	1921000	He'll be here for sure.
1921000	1922000	But will he be good here?
1922000	1923000	Like, it sounds like he'll pee.
1923000	1924000	No, no.
1924000	1925000	He won't be here.
1925000	1926000	No, he'll freak people out.
1926000	1927000	He'll be like,
1927000	1928000	Oh, what's going on?
1928000	1930000	What's happening?
1930000	1931000	And then everyone will go like,
1931000	1934000	Oh, that's a bit.
1934000	1938000	And then you'll...
1938000	1940000	He'll call me Doug Herman.
1940000	1941000	And you'll be like,
1941000	1943000	Fucking classic.
1943000	1945000	Always forgets the name.
1945000	1947000	And then he'll, like, I don't know, man.
1947000	1949000	I'm telling you.
1949000	1951000	I think it's a coin toss.
1951000	1953000	I think it's either going to be a bummer like you think
1953000	1956000	or some sort of weird magical breakthrough will happen.
1956000	1957000	That would be cool.
1957000	1959000	I've learned one thing for sure.
1959000	1961000	Like, keep it above board.
1961000	1963000	Like, keep calling him out.
1963000	1965000	Keep, you know, don't, like,
1965000	1967000	chuckle nervously and go,
1967000	1969000	Okay, we got to just go like,
1969000	1971000	What the fuck are you talking about?
1971000	1973000	Now that he has a chance to respond.
1973000	1976000	I will go to my grave a happy little asshole
1976000	1982000	if we can get Chevy to either play Dungeons and Dragons with us
1982000	1986000	or freestyle rap.
1986000	1987000	Yeah.
1987000	1989000	I think he's got a rap in him.
1989000	1991000	Well, you know, he actually classically does.
1991000	1994000	He had a rap album like when he was like in his next one.
1994000	1995000	No, he didn't.
1995000	1998000	Google it.
1998000	1999000	Google it.
1999000	2001000	See, our website, we should have a link.
2001000	2004000	You should go click on that moment on the podcast.
2004000	2005000	We will. We will have a website.
2005000	2009000	Click on all this stuff.
2009000	2010000	It's true.
2010000	2012000	It's true.
2012000	2013000	That way, Walt.
2013000	2014000	But never will.
2014000	2015000	Never will.
2015000	2018000	No, Sharouz, our webmaster, had a,
2018000	2021000	he had some kind of family or no, personal.
2021000	2023000	He had a, Sharouz is what?
2023000	2024000	What were you?
2024000	2026000	I was just laughing at some kind of family.
2026000	2028000	Oh, Sharouz has got some kind of family.
2028000	2030000	I don't know.
2030000	2031000	I guess it's an Indian name.
2031000	2034000	He's probably got like a thousand people.
2035000	2036000	Hey, what's going on over there?
2036000	2041000	No, that's racist, horrible, shitty, edit it out, whitewash it.
2045000	2049000	The Sharouz, our web genius, he,
2049000	2052000	I think he, something happened like it was doubled up.
2052000	2055000	Like he ripped something in his leg or something,
2055000	2056000	so his leg was useless,
2056000	2059000	and then he got in a car accident or the other way around.
2059000	2060000	Like they weren't related.
2060000	2062000	There were two things that should go together, but...
2062000	2063000	Is he okay?
2063000	2064000	Yeah, he's fine.
2064000	2065000	I mean, fuck him.
2065000	2067000	Get back to work.
2067000	2069000	Where's our website?
2069000	2071000	He had a lot of shit happening,
2071000	2075000	and we're probably not paying him very much, if anything.
2075000	2076000	Well, I'm not.
2076000	2078000	Well, I don't check my own books,
2078000	2082000	so he may have embezzled millions of dollars.
2082000	2085000	Are we paying Neil Berkley?
2085000	2087000	Yeah, well, Neil is...
2094000	2097000	Neil doesn't exist, first of all.
2097000	2098000	What?
2098000	2099000	Neil doesn't exist.
2099000	2101000	No, he's right fucking behind me right now.
2101000	2106000	He's like Drop Dead Fred or any of the characters from Inside Herman's Head
2106000	2110000	or Right's Head Fred or...
2110000	2113000	Yeah, fuck you, Herman.
2113000	2118000	Tried to string three rhyming 80s references.
2118000	2119000	He almost got there.
2119000	2122000	Third one wasn't about an imaginary character, though.
2123000	2125000	Neil is...
2125000	2127000	Neil, this is a labor of love for him.
2127000	2128000	He's in it for the art.
2128000	2129000	He's not getting paid?
2129000	2131000	Well, if the movie makes money.
2131000	2132000	Oh, okay.
2132000	2133000	We'll give him some.
2133000	2134000	Am I getting paid?
2134000	2138000	You will be a salaried employee of Harment Town Incorporated,
2138000	2139000	which is just formed.
2139000	2142000	I just want to sit in the bus and sit in my pajamas
2142000	2144000	and play ukulele and sing Pringles Dick
2144000	2147000	and just be alive for the ride.
2147000	2149000	Pringles is in the rider, by the way.
2149000	2151000	We're having Pringles cans on the tour bus.
2151000	2152000	We got to draw up a budget.
2152000	2154000	We got to deal with these things.
2154000	2155000	One thing that...
2155000	2156000	Because Neil and I were talking,
2156000	2157000	and Neil, who does not exist
2157000	2161000	and is not affecting the movie at all,
2161000	2164000	after Three Amstel's getting him to agree to do the thing
2164000	2166000	and further talking about what we could do, he...
2166000	2168000	You can get Neil Berkeley to do almost anything
2168000	2170000	after Three Amstel's.
2170000	2173000	He said that...
2173000	2177000	What a work, sir!
2177000	2179000	He will shit up a bridge in your head.
2179000	2184000	That's called an ultra Danny Thomas.
2184000	2189000	If there's a giant coffee table over the ferry...
2189000	2192000	You've got three people on that reference.
2192000	2195000	At Candor's Deli, Danny Thomas, famous comedian,
2195000	2197000	father-in-nose-best, Lebanese descent,
2197000	2199000	great comedian, lovely man,
2199000	2201000	apparently liked to poop on coffee tables.
2201000	2203000	People poop on coffee tables above him.
2203000	2205000	And that was his thing, apparently.
2205000	2206000	Who knows?
2206000	2207000	It could be the Richard Gere, Gerbil thing.
2207000	2208000	We don't know.
2208000	2210000	But at Candor's Deli...
2210000	2212000	And I'm almost certain this is the truth.
2212000	2213000	I remember this.
2213000	2216000	The number one is the Jackie Gleason.
2216000	2217000	The number three is the Bob Hope.
2217000	2219000	And that's the corned beef or whatever.
2219000	2222000	The number two was the Danny Thomas.
2222000	2226000	And it was a hot roast beef sandwich.
2226000	2228000	Which looks like a turd on a bun.
2228000	2230000	And it was the fucking number two.
2230000	2233000	And I know a woman whose family was a part owner of Candor's
2233000	2235000	and they cannot verify if that was a happy accident
2235000	2240000	or just missed you.
2240000	2242000	Men, you missed you.
2242000	2244000	The number two.
2244000	2245000	He liked to be shit on.
2245000	2248000	Anyways, this guy who doesn't exist
2248000	2250000	that I was talking to about the show
2250000	2252000	and the possibilities of going on tour
2252000	2254000	did point out that he felt,
2254000	2256000	and his colleagues who came to the show for the first time,
2256000	2258000	who don't know Dan Harmon from Fuck All
2258000	2259000	and nor Harmon Town,
2259000	2261000	and they're just professionals coming to the show,
2261000	2263000	they said above and beyond that D&D
2263000	2265000	was the highlight of the show,
2265000	2267000	and that it would be a crime to not do D&D on the road
2267000	2269000	when we go to these different cities.
2269000	2272000	So Spencer is asking off of work,
2272000	2275000	which is a decision he'll forever regret.
2277000	2279000	And Dustin's coming with us,
2279000	2281000	which means that we will be, yeah,
2281000	2284000	we'll be a mobile D&D pumping like,
2284000	2286000	Mobisode.
2286000	2287000	Mobisode?
2287000	2290000	Mobisode!
2290000	2292000	My dream is to start a Mobisode company
2293000	2296000	and approach the Mobisodess as if they're Webisodes.
2298000	2301000	I'm tired of Mobisodes having their own standard.
2301000	2305000	I want, like, why did we stop thinking of them as Webisodes?
2305000	2309000	Why did we stop, there's things that you do for a Webisode.
2309000	2312000	You put a minimal amount of the money left over
2312000	2314000	from your TV show into them.
2314000	2316000	You hire a non-union crew.
2316000	2319000	You do almost nothing.
2319000	2321000	Why can't you do that for Mobisodes?
2322000	2324000	Did you make up Mobisode?
2324000	2325000	No, I did not, sir.
2325000	2326000	No?
2326000	2327000	Oh, somebody's already sent that?
2327000	2328000	No.
2328000	2330000	That and the word webinar exists.
2330000	2332000	They get to go on the Smash Mouth boat.
2332000	2336000	Somewhere, someone is using the word webinar, like, for real.
2336000	2337000	Webinar?
2337000	2338000	Yeah, webinar.
2338000	2340000	So if you watch the webinar,
2340000	2343000	it's like a seminar on the web.
2343000	2347000	I worked with, oh, what the fuck is his name?
2347000	2349000	Webinar Donaldson?
2350000	2352000	Steve O'Donnell, a writer.
2352000	2354000	He was Letterman's writer forever,
2354000	2357000	and he and I had kind of a love-hate relationship
2357000	2362000	with word combinations, like snackatizers,
2362000	2365000	things like that, like you hate them,
2365000	2369000	or appetizers, or stuff like that.
2369000	2371000	He used to give me voicemails.
2371000	2373000	He goes, hey, Jeff, it's Steve O'Dee.
2373000	2374000	Steve O'Dee?
2374000	2375000	Yeah.
2375000	2377000	I'm on a plane right now taxiing in LaGuardia,
2377000	2379000	and I'm looking through the Skymall magazine,
2379000	2381000	and I'm reading about an electric blanket
2381000	2386000	that boasts of its stimulaxing qualities.
2386000	2388000	Stimulaxing.
2388000	2389000	The only good one I've ever heard,
2389000	2390000	the only one that actually can sign off,
2390000	2392000	my brother used to be a bartender
2392000	2394000	at the Chart House at a seafood restaurant,
2394000	2400000	and every year they would have their annual extravaganza.
2400000	2401000	And that's a fucking goodie.
2401000	2402000	That's a goodie.
2402000	2404000	If you come up with extravaganza,
2404000	2406000	I'm in your corner.
2406000	2409000	Also, the only, spooktacular's good.
2409000	2411000	Spooktacular's so good that there's no such thing
2411000	2413000	as a spectacular anymore.
2413000	2416000	I don't think anyone, has anyone here been to a spectacular
2416000	2418000	since 98?
2418000	2423000	I think it's only spooktaculars now from now on.
2423000	2425000	But not fucking webinar.
2425000	2426000	No webinars.
2426000	2427000	Webinar's dumb.
2427000	2428000	Mobisode?
2428000	2430000	Here's the difference between extravaganza
2430000	2433000	and spooktacular and webinar.
2433000	2435000	No one wants to go to a fucking seminar.
2435000	2436000	No one wants to be on the web.
2436000	2438000	No one wants you combining anything in that area.
2438000	2439000	No matter how much you combine,
2439000	2440000	you're not going to make it fascinating.
2440000	2441000	Fuck you.
2441000	2444000	It's just a shitty guy telling me how to do my job.
2444000	2446000	I don't want nutraceuticals either.
2446000	2447000	Yeah, yeah.
2447000	2448000	We don't need it.
2448000	2449000	You can do all the dandying you want
2449000	2451000	with all the syllables in the world,
2451000	2455000	but boring job's a boring job.
2455000	2462000	It's not an adventure-tunity.
2462000	2464000	I knew somebody that worked at a camp,
2464000	2465000	and they were their title,
2465000	2467000	and they had a business card, the poor fucker,
2467000	2470000	as the director of edutainment.
2470000	2471000	Edutainment?
2471000	2472000	Fuck.
2472000	2473000	Why not?
2473000	2474000	Why not?
2474000	2475000	No.
2475000	2476000	No.
2476000	2477000	No.
2477000	2478000	Absolutely not.
2478000	2479000	All right.
2479000	2480000	Well, just give me a taste.
2480000	2481000	Okay.
2481000	2482000	You guys be Phoenix, okay?
2482000	2484000	And just run me through some scenarios.
2484000	2486000	I want to start training for the tour.
2486000	2487000	Oh my God.
2487000	2489000	This show and then the next show we do,
2489000	2491000	and then I believe the next time I go on stage
2491000	2493000	in front of a microphone,
2493000	2496000	I will be in front of a sober jury
2496000	2499000	of Phoenician eyes.
2499000	2500000	They're called Phoenicians, right?
2500000	2501000	Yes.
2501000	2502000	Yeah.
2502000	2505000	They are Carthaginians.
2505000	2508000	Depending on if they're loyal.
2508000	2509000	All right.
2509000	2511000	So I don't know.
2511000	2513000	I just want to run through the wringer a little bit.
2513000	2514000	I can't prepare for everything,
2514000	2517000	but you guys are so loving all the time.
2517000	2519000	Can you just boo me?
2519000	2520000	Have Jeff introduce me,
2520000	2523000	and then just...
2523000	2524000	All right.
2524000	2525000	Okay.
2525000	2526000	Well, try this.
2526000	2527000	Do this.
2527000	2528000	Be unimpressed with me.
2528000	2531000	And then whatever thought I launch into,
2531000	2532000	let it hit a button for you.
2532000	2534000	You want me to do fake intros
2534000	2536000	when you come on, say hello, Phoenix,
2536000	2537000	and do a couple?
2537000	2539000	Or do you want to just be in the middle of it?
2539000	2540000	Yeah.
2540000	2541000	Fire something up.
2541000	2542000	Do it as quickly as you can.
2542000	2543000	So I'm going to come up.
2543000	2545000	Just basically just sit in silence.
2545000	2546000	You're a crowd.
2546000	2548000	You paid $10.
2548000	2549000	This is some bullshit.
2549000	2552000	Or pretend you paid $1,000.
2552000	2554000	And no one's going to pay $1,000.
2554000	2559000	I'm just saying, get yourself in the zone.
2559000	2560000	And you're like, who's this guy?
2560000	2569000	I came to the chuckleback steakhouse.
2569000	2571000	And even from the name, I'm in a bad mood
2571000	2574000	because it doesn't rhyme with anything.
2574000	2575000	All right, everybody.
2575000	2577000	Welcome to the chuckleback steakhouse.
2577000	2578000	Phoenix, Arizona.
2578000	2580000	Put your hands together for the mayor of Harman Town,
2580000	2584000	Dan Harman.
2584000	2587000	Yo, yo, yo, yo.
2587000	2590000	Yo, yo, yo, yo.
2590000	2591000	I fucked your mama.
2591000	2593000	I fucked her in the mouth.
2593000	2595000	I fucked your mama in the north and the south.
2595000	2596000	I fucked your mama.
2596000	2598000	I fucked her good.
2598000	2600000	I fucked your mama in her neighborhood.
2600000	2601000	I said, fuck your mama.
2601000	2603000	Fuck your mama until she dies.
2603000	2605000	I fucked your mama because I love pizza pies.
2605000	2606000	Fuck your mama.
2606000	2607000	All right, cool.
2607000	2608000	All right, cool, cool, cool.
2608000	2609000	Dan, you had him.
2609000	2610000	You had him.
2610000	2611000	No, no, no.
2611000	2612000	All right.
2612000	2613000	Hey, Phoenix.
2613000	2614000	How you doing, everybody?
2614000	2615000	Yeah.
2615000	2617000	Guys, take it easy.
2617000	2619000	Guys, take it easy.
2619000	2621000	Phoenix, I love you guys.
2621000	2622000	I love it.
2622000	2625000	I love it here in New Mexico.
2625000	2633000	I'm not prepared for it.
2633000	2634000	All right.
2635000	2637000	I don't know how to get him back when that happens.
2637000	2640000	Austin, Texas, put your hands together
2640000	2642000	for the mayor of Harman Town.
2642000	2644000	His first time at the Taj Maha.
2644000	2649000	Welcome, Dan Harman.
2649000	2652000	Texas, not starting with a rap.
2652000	2653000	Learned my lesson in Phoenix.
2653000	2654000	Fuck Phoenix, right?
2654000	2656000	Fuck Phoenix.
2656000	2660000	Yeah, yo, yo, yo, yo.
2660000	2663000	I fucked your mama because the bitch is from Phoenix.
2663000	2665000	I fucked her in her mouth and her penis.
2665000	2668000	She's got a penis because the bitch is from Phoenix.
2668000	2671000	Transgender awareness is penis.
2671000	2672000	Oh, no, I'm sorry.
2672000	2673000	I'm sorry.
2673000	2674000	I forgot.
2674000	2676000	I forgot Austin is the transgender capital
2676000	2679000	of the South.
2679000	2680000	Shit.
2680000	2681000	I'm sorry.
2681000	2683000	Nashville, Tennessee.
2683000	2686000	Nashville, Tennessee, welcome to Chuckle Muffins.
2686000	2690000	Put your hands together for the mayor of Harman Town,
2690000	2692000	Mr. Dan Harman.
2693000	2701000	Tennessee.
2701000	2704000	Yo, my dick is big and it's big as Tennessee.
2704000	2707000	Everyone's dick is in Tennessee as big as mine.
2707000	2708000	Yeah.
2708000	2710000	Fuck your mamas.
2710000	2711000	Fuck.
2711000	2713000	All right.
2713000	2714000	Tennessee.
2714000	2716000	Let's not rap in Tennessee.
2716000	2718000	Tennessee.
2718000	2719000	Thank you so much for having me.
2719000	2721000	It's so fucking great to be here.
2721000	2725000	And, like, I'm so...
2725000	2726000	Fuck.
2726000	2729000	Sorry about the election results.
2729000	2731000	Yeah.
2731000	2733000	That was a monster.
2733000	2734000	You know what?
2734000	2736000	It was a squeaker and my audience is liberal.
2736000	2742000	I meant I was sorry about them because of how much
2742000	2743000	of a squeaker it was.
2743000	2744000	It shouldn't have been.
2744000	2747000	You should have been right because you guys voted
2747000	2750000	for the right person in Tennessee.
2750000	2751000	I wanted to...
2751000	2754000	I heard I wanted too much from a Tennessean in the...
2754000	2755000	All right.
2755000	2757000	Hey, hey, fuck you, Tennessee.
2757000	2759000	Fuck you.
2759000	2762000	Fuck you, buddy.
2767000	2769000	It's not worth it.
2769000	2771000	It's not worth it.
2771000	2775000	Nobody leaves with a camera.
2775000	2778000	Lock the doors.
2779000	2783000	Send them to the assassination trench.
2783000	2786000	That's when you find out I got billions of dollars.
2786000	2789000	It's just hover copters come down.
2789000	2790000	Mo everybody down.
2790000	2794000	Now, based on what you've learned on your first three stops...
2794000	2796000	I don't know what I've learned.
2796000	2797000	No, no, no, no.
2797000	2799000	Just let it wash over you.
2799000	2802000	Now, let's just thrust ourselves right into the middle
2802000	2804000	of Tallahassee, Florida.
2804000	2811000	This is the second act, the meeting with the goddess of Tallahassee.
2814000	2815000	My dad beat me.
2815000	2816000	Beat me real hard.
2816000	2817000	That's why I drink.
2817000	2819000	I drink in the backyard.
2819000	2821000	I'm trying to open myself up to you.
2821000	2823000	Tallahassee, what you saying?
2823000	2824000	We're going to do.
2824000	2826000	We're going to get everyone up on stage.
2826000	2828000	Tallahassee, get up and dance.
2828000	2829000	You're not going to see me.
2829000	2831000	Fuck you, motherfucker.
2831000	2832000	I knew it.
2832000	2835000	How much money do you spend fucking with me?
2835000	2838000	This guy's a fucking asshole.
2838000	2839000	It's Greg Barrett.
2839000	2840000	Yeah, Greg Barrett.
2840000	2841000	Greg Barrett.
2841000	2842000	That's it.
2842000	2844000	Greg Barrett's going to come and fuck with us the whole way.
2844000	2845000	We know that.
2845000	2846000	Fucking A.
2846000	2847000	Yeah.
2847000	2849000	Other comics are not going to make this easy on you.
2849000	2850000	No.
2850000	2851000	Because Patton Oswalt's going to go,
2851000	2852000	I already did this shit.
2852000	2853000	Right.
2853000	2855000	Yeah, he's fucking biting my moose.
2855000	2860000	I saw Patton at a party the other night, Humblebreg.
2860000	2867000	I don't know why I was there.
2867000	2868000	But I grabbed him for a second.
2868000	2871000	I was like, we've got to go out and have a drink
2871000	2873000	and talk because he did the Comedians of Comedy thing.
2873000	2876000	It's like, there's got to be something to learn from Patton Oswalt.
2876000	2884000	This is not all the more so because we're not doing comedy.
2884000	2886000	So we're not comedians of comedy.
2886000	2889000	We're comedians of deception.
2890000	2893000	We can't play musical instruments.
2893000	2895000	And I don't mean to say we.
2895000	2896000	You'll be fine.
2896000	2897000	I'll be fine.
2897000	2900000	Ladies and gentlemen, Boston, Massachusetts,
2900000	2906000	midway through the show, the very Boston Adam Goldberg
2906000	2907000	comes up on the stage.
2907000	2908000	Hey, hey, hey.
2908000	2909000	Hey, hey, hey.
2909000	2910000	Wait, wait, wait.
2910000	2911000	Hey, fuck you.
2911000	2912000	You don't owe me money.
2912000	2914000	Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam.
2914000	2917000	How did you know I was going to fucking do that?
2917000	2921000	I was going to say, we bring up the Boston Cliff Clavin version
2921000	2922000	of Adam Goldberg.
2922000	2926000	And you were already on your fucking seat.
2926000	2928000	We were coming at the same joke from different angles.
2928000	2931000	It was like, if you were going to say Boston,
2931000	2933000	I'm going to sneak into Boston.
2933000	2934000	That's uncanny.
2934000	2935000	But I really was going to do a bit.
2935000	2937000	We're going to bring up the Boston you.
2937000	2938000	And you were half way.
2938000	2939000	Oh, the Boston me.
2939000	2940000	Oh, the Boston me.
2940000	2941000	I sure love 2009.
2941000	2942000	What up?
2942000	2946000	What up?
2946000	2947000	How did you know?
2947000	2948000	It's so weird.
2948000	2950000	You just fucking knew.
2950000	2951000	Yeah.
2951000	2954000	Dan, did you have to get your own vodka?
2954000	2957000	I was actually getting Adam's.
2957000	2958000	Oh, yeah, right.
2958000	2959000	I'm trained now.
2959000	2960000	All right.
2960000	2961000	Boston vodka.
2961000	2962000	I know it makes them tick.
2962000	2966000	And I know it makes them sleepy.
2966000	2970000	I'm learning bad parenting lessons already.
2970000	2974000	And that is why the Statue of Liberty is not a big deal.
2974000	2978000	That's why the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island and Governors
2978000	2979000	Island.
2979000	2980000	Not so great.
2980000	2982000	Look, you're supposed to be doing this on a Boston accent
2982000	2984000	right now.
2984000	2986000	Oh, sorry.
2986000	2990000	I stuttered instead of laughing at that really good joke.
2990000	2991000	It's quite solid.
2991000	2994000	Hey, Aaron said you're not allowed to drink on your medicine.
2994000	2997000	No, Aaron says I get really drunk really easily
2997000	2999000	when I drink on my medicine.
3000000	3001000	All right.
3001000	3002000	Don't get it.
3002000	3003000	Don't get drunk.
3003000	3008000	Take your roommates lies and appreciate having said them.
3008000	3009000	Wow.
3009000	3011000	That's it.
3011000	3012000	You know what?
3012000	3013000	It's like fucking big.
3013000	3016000	It's just like being in Boston, actually.
3016000	3018000	This is the wickedest return to this show.
3018000	3019000	You take that down, soup boy.
3019000	3021000	You pride the tea on that thing.
3021000	3023000	But Boston can be a very angry.
3023000	3025000	Anyone from here from Boston?
3025000	3026000	Anybody?
3026000	3027000	No?
3027000	3028000	Really?
3028000	3029000	What the fuck is going on?
3029000	3031000	Boston can be kind of an angry town.
3031000	3032000	They're a jockular.
3032000	3033000	They're jockular.
3033000	3035000	And really, really racist.
3035000	3037000	Like, that's our reputation just because we
3037000	3039000	had severe busing riots.
3039000	3040000	Well, you're from there?
3040000	3041000	Yeah.
3041000	3042000	When you can't do the accent?
3042000	3044000	I was born when I'm tired.
3044000	3046000	I can do the accent when I'm...
3051000	3052000	Jeff, Jeff.
3052000	3054000	You're like Davis, like the square, right?
3054000	3055000	Jeff, Davis square.
3055000	3056000	You ride the tea in that thing.
3056000	3057000	Oh, my God.
3057000	3060000	You lace curtain motherfucker.
3060000	3062000	You lace curtain motherfucker coming in
3062000	3064000	calling Somerville Boston.
3064000	3065000	That's retarded.
3065000	3066000	That's good.
3066000	3067000	There we are.
3067000	3069000	Adam Goldberg, everybody.
3071000	3072000	All right.
3072000	3073000	Spencer, get up and start setting up
3073000	3074000	your D&D equipment.
3074000	3075000	Wait, Dan.
3075000	3076000	Dan, did you notice that?
3076000	3078000	I said Adam Goldberg, and he actually
3078000	3079000	walked off the stage.
3079000	3080000	He actually left.
3080000	3081000	Yeah.
3081000	3082000	He's not, yeah.
3082000	3084000	We're training him like shampoo.
3084000	3085000	Yeah, yeah.
3086000	3088000	But slowly, his little flipper, his fin's going
3088000	3089000	to start to droop over.
3089000	3090000	He's going to lose all spirit.
3090000	3091000	Yeah.
3093000	3095000	Somebody goes, woo!
3095000	3096000	Lose that spirit!
3100000	3102000	We have to take a secret ballot of whether
3102000	3105000	people are on or not on Adam's side at some point.
3106000	3108000	Well, we have that conversation with Dustin
3108000	3109000	and I when we were editing it.
3109000	3110000	Dustin was like, what do you think?
3110000	3112000	And I was like, because we actually, we cut out
3112000	3113000	for those of you.
3114000	3116000	And I feel a little bit bad about this only
3116000	3118000	in the sense of I put myself in Adam's shoes
3118000	3120000	listening to the most recent recording where
3120000	3122000	it was basically the only thing I had time
3122000	3124000	to cut out was all of Adam.
3125000	3127000	I was so behind schedule because we skipped
3127000	3129000	Thanksgiving and people are clamoring that
3129000	3131000	your most important fans are the people that
3131000	3133000	can do without you the least.
3133000	3135000	You want to let them down the least, and I know
3135000	3137000	they're the craziest, but they're the most
3137000	3138000	important.
3138000	3140000	You want to keep feeding them or your audience
3140000	3142000	will hate you.
3142000	3145000	So I have so much shit to do right now.
3145000	3147000	I'm trying to write a CBS thing and a Fox thing
3147000	3149000	and I'm so behind I got to leave on the 17th
3149000	3151000	for Europe.
3153000	3155000	My life is a nightmare.
3156000	3158000	I got these Patton Oswalt parties to go to
3158000	3159000	and I just...
3163000	3165000	I don't know why that made me gay.
3166000	3167000	That was a bad choice.
3168000	3170000	I was trying to be fancy, not gay.
3171000	3173000	I wasn't doing a thing.
3176000	3177000	I pumped it out.
3177000	3178000	I pumped out the jam.
3179000	3181000	Just Dave Matthews did all over the fucking
3181000	3182000	airwaves.
3182000	3184000	But the one thing I did have time to cut out
3184000	3186000	was Adam Goldberg coming up and reading his
3186000	3187000	journals.
3188000	3190000	I read my journals and then Adam comes up
3190000	3191000	and reads his journals.
3191000	3193000	Adam's 24, he read his journals from his phone
3193000	3194000	from when he was 20.
3195000	3197000	It didn't have the same panache.
3198000	3199000	It wasn't the...
3200000	3202000	But there was other stuff I could have edited
3202000	3204000	over time, but I didn't get surgical about
3204000	3206000	the back half because I just ran out of time.
3206000	3208000	So it's me and Jesus Diaz talking about the
3208000	3210000	woes of being creative and not fulfilling it.
3210000	3212000	You know, that's unedited.
3212000	3213000	But anyways...
3214000	3216000	The big question is, yeah...
3216000	3218000	It's not a question I want you guys to answer
3218000	3220000	necessarily because, again, I say it's a coin
3220000	3221000	landing on its edge.
3221000	3223000	Like when are we on Adam's side and when are
3223000	3224000	we against him?
3224000	3226000	I was very fascinated by his journals from four
3226000	3228000	years ago because it was a glimpse into a time
3228000	3231000	when Barack Obama was still in office.
3232000	3233000	It was really...
3233000	3234000	It was an amazing flashback.
3234000	3237000	When Adam was journaling with his phone back
3237000	3238000	then.
3239000	3241000	Yeah, I don't know, man.
3241000	3242000	I know that...
3242000	3245000	Sometimes I feel like when we bring Adam up
3245000	3247000	and then I try to ride the line like I want
3247000	3249000	the audience to know, it's like, look, this guy
3249000	3251000	doesn't have a golden ticket or anything.
3251000	3252000	Don't get mad at him.
3253000	3254000	We'll make fun of him.
3254000	3256000	But then he sits down and then sometimes I feel
3256000	3258000	like, oh, did we just make fun of...
3258000	3259000	What am I?
3259000	3260000	Howard Stern?
3260000	3261000	I got like a whack pack?
3261000	3262000	Like, now what am I doing?
3262000	3264000	Like, remember when the guy, the guy that was
3264000	3265000	sitting there...
3265000	3266000	Where's Big Red?
3266000	3267000	Big Red!
3267000	3268000	He's not here?
3268000	3269000	I took care of Big Red.
3272000	3276000	Adam, if we find out that Big Red has been
3276000	3279000	killed, you're under indictment immediately.
3279000	3281000	Last week in particular, Adam just said I took
3281000	3283000	care of Big Red from the audience.
3284000	3285000	I love Big Red.
3285000	3286000	Come back, Big Red!
3286000	3288000	Last week there was this guy sitting over here
3288000	3291000	in this huge laugh, super giggly, like really
3291000	3292000	infectious, and everyone loved him.
3292000	3294000	And it was like, it was a big guy with red hair
3294000	3296000	and his name was Big Red and we brought him up
3296000	3298000	and he was, sorry, I'm Big Red, and every
3298000	3300000	question he answered, like, what's your name?
3300000	3302000	I go, you can call me Big Red.
3302000	3304000	And I go, are you from the area?
3304000	3305000	No, no sir.
3306000	3309000	He had a laugh like a big Viking dolphin.
3309000	3310000	Yeah.
3311000	3315000	Yeah, like a Helium, Helium, Helium Zeppelin.
3315000	3316000	Helior.
3316000	3317000	Norse warriors.
3317000	3318000	Helios.
3320000	3322000	You know, but then this is where I started to
3322000	3324000	feel like a bully, because I was like, we have
3324000	3326000	Big Red up, so I was like, oh, it's a new character.
3326000	3328000	And then I started doing the bit of like, oh,
3328000	3329000	I bet Adam Goldberg's really jealous.
3329000	3330000	We brought Adam up.
3330000	3333000	And then at one point Adam, you know, of course
3333000	3335000	he goes like, oh, fuck Big Red, or he mocked
3335000	3337000	Big Red's laugh or something like, like Adam's
3337000	3338000	not a hateful person.
3338000	3339000	He's diabolical.
3339000	3340000	He's calculating.
3340000	3344000	He's anything but human.
3344000	3349000	But he's robotic.
3349000	3351000	He's a million flaws.
3351000	3352000	Fundamental ones.
3352000	3353000	Fundamental ones.
3353000	3357000	Like from the carbon-based flaws.
3357000	3360000	But I don't think he is a hateful person.
3360000	3361000	I don't think he's like petty.
3361000	3363000	I think all of us are kind of like in a big
3363000	3364000	warm nerd hug here kind of.
3364000	3366000	The point is that you're not a bully.
3366000	3372000	And I felt like I was kidding.
3372000	3375000	I had a flashback that I didn't share with everybody
3375000	3376000	to like the back of the school bus.
3376000	3378000	So it was like, that was a bullying technique.
3378000	3381000	When bullies would pick on me, I remember sometimes
3381000	3383000	then another thing they'd do is they'd go, hey, Dan,
3383000	3385000	what do you think of so-and-so?
3385000	3386000	You know what I mean?
3386000	3388000	It's like a bullying technique.
3388000	3391000	It made me feel like I was like, because then one person
3391000	3392000	goes like, I don't know.
3392000	3393000	He's wearing a hat.
3393000	3395000	I go, oh, shit.
3395000	3396000	Oh, shit.
3396000	3399000	You're going to take that from him?
3399000	3401000	And it's just bullshit.
3401000	3402000	It's like Nazi bullshit.
3402000	3403000	I don't like it.
3403000	3406000	Anyways, I mistakenly crossed that line.
3406000	3407000	It wasn't intentional.
3407000	3409000	I just think it was behavioral and not intentional.
3409000	3410000	I wasn't thinking about it.
3410000	3412000	I didn't mean to pit Adam against Big Red.
3412000	3416000	But Adam, if you killed Big Red, that's fucked up.
3416000	3418000	But I don't know.
3418000	3419000	Can we have a little later?
3419000	3420000	You've got to admire the loyalty.
3420000	3424000	When Cherus, as well, again, can we get a little link
3424000	3426000	of maybe just a little Easter egg?
3426000	3428000	You have to search our website for Adam?
3428000	3429000	Yeah.
3429000	3432000	It's a really goth-y design and music where he's just
3432000	3433000	reading his journals.
3433000	3436000	Can Adam just come up as a flash animation about the thing?
3436000	3440000	Are you using Safari?
3440000	3443000	This website will function in that web browser,
3443000	3448000	but it would work much better in a Linux-based environment.
3448000	3449000	Ladies and gentlemen.
3449000	3455000	Meet me down at the bottom, and I'll tell you more.
3455000	3456000	Let's reintroduce our guest.
3456000	3457000	This is the tour section.
3457000	3459000	You'll find all kinds of concert information
3459000	3461000	and ticket links for all available dates.
3461000	3465000	See you on the next page.
3465000	3470000	I found the gold bug.
3470000	3472000	Remember the Richard Scarry books?
3472000	3473000	Gold bug?
3473000	3474000	Goldberg?
3474000	3475000	Gold bug?
3475000	3476000	Adam Gold Bug.
3476000	3477000	Can't be.
3477000	3478000	Can't be a coincidence.
3478000	3484000	You know he calls his car the Goldsmobile.
3484000	3488000	It's riveting.
3488000	3490000	He also does better than Chevy would up here.
3490000	3491000	I'm telling you that.
3491000	3492000	Huh?
3492000	3493000	I'm telling you, he'd...
3493000	3494000	Oh, get them up to her together.
3494000	3497000	Yeah.
3497000	3500000	Chevy would just burst into flames.
3500000	3502000	Can we like, are you a queer or a...
3502000	3503000	Can we do like a mock-up of...
3503000	3505000	Quick pace.
3505000	3507000	Yeah, let's do a mock-up of Family Feud
3507000	3510000	and make them play each other.
3510000	3511000	I can't...
3511000	3517000	My targeting system's offline.
3517000	3519000	Let's introduce our dungeon master
3519000	3521000	who's been patiently sitting up here.
3521000	3526000	Spencer, everyone.
3526000	3531000	The Ayatollah of 20-sided Rola.
3531000	3532000	I don't know.
3532000	3533000	I don't know.
3534000	3539000	The Duke of Dice.
3539000	3541000	That's the only one that's it.
3541000	3543000	The King of...
3543000	3545000	The Caliph of Character Sheets.
3545000	3548000	The Prince of Pencils.
3548000	3550000	There's always the Sultan of something.
3550000	3552000	The Sultan of...
3554000	3556000	I like saving throws.
3556000	3558000	Saving throws, the Sultan of saving throws.
3558000	3559000	Thank you.
3559000	3560000	Nerd Alert.
3561000	3563000	That doesn't work here, Nerd Alert.
3563000	3565000	Spencer, if you would be so kind,
3565000	3568000	bring us up to date on the campaign.
3569000	3572000	Alright, let me just let this come down a bit.
3573000	3578000	When we last met, our heroes had come upon a null village.
3578000	3580000	While contemplating their next move,
3580000	3583000	the party was ambushed by Yurch the Null.
3583000	3587000	The Null identified himself as an allied Null of the Blackpaw Tribe
3587000	3590000	temporary second-in-command of the Butts Barbarians.
3590000	3594000	Yurch told the heroes that this camp belonged to the vile White Skull Nulls
3594000	3597000	and Quark talked to squirrels and shit.
3598000	3603000	Soon, our heroes found themselves in a pit trap facing a deadly gelatinous cube.
3603000	3607000	Through the magic of unnatural male enhancement and a critical stomp,
3607000	3611000	the foe was felled and the friends found freedom.
3611000	3613000	The Null encampment lay ahead
3613000	3617000	and Sharpie's blood-tracking spell pulled them ever forward.
3618000	3620000	You should get her up here.
3620000	3622000	Do you want to bring Erin?
3625000	3626000	Erin McGathey.
3626000	3628000	Alright, well there's a character secret.
3628000	3629000	Thank you.
3630000	3632000	No, I know, I know.
3632000	3635000	Spencer has become Erin's guardian in D&D.
3635000	3636000	There's nothing to apologize.
3636000	3638000	I sleep with her.
3638000	3641000	I understand the instinct to protect her.
3641000	3642000	I can't see enough of her.
3642000	3644000	Welcome Erin McGathey to the stage.
3649000	3652000	For better or for worse?
3654000	3658000	I just spilled vodka all over my face, so I don't know if I have.
3658000	3660000	For worse.
3663000	3667000	I was pinching the cup and I squirted vodka in my face.
3667000	3669000	I will hide the ring a week longer.
3673000	3675000	No biggie.
3680000	3682000	Was that a don't joke about that?
3682000	3685000	This feels terrible.
3687000	3691000	I guess the right response is don't fucking joke about marrying your girlfriend.
3691000	3692000	It's not funny.
3692000	3694000	It's irresistible sometimes.
3694000	3697000	Women love jokes about pretending to not want to marry them.
3697000	3699000	It's their favorite thing.
3699000	3700000	Or just teeing up.
3700000	3702000	Yeah, I always get married.
3702000	3703000	Always hilarious.
3703000	3704000	Always helps your relationship.
3704000	3705000	Well, good news.
3705000	3709000	I squirted vodka all over my face because I'm wasted, so I won't remember anything.
3709000	3710000	I always do remember.
3710000	3713000	We make the mistake of playing Dungeons and Dragons at the last point in the show,
3713000	3715000	so no matter how sober I am when I come up here,
3715000	3720000	I'm always like, I'm wrapped by Spencer's description of what we did last week.
3720000	3723000	I'm like, okay, alright.
3723000	3726000	Blackpaw gnolls, you say.
3726000	3728000	Alright, so where are we standing, Spencer?
3728000	3732000	You guys just got out of the pit that you escaped from,
3732000	3736000	and now you're running again towards the village.
3736000	3737000	So it's me?
3737000	3740000	It's the village where my dad was going to meet these...
3740000	3743000	You came upon the village after casting a blood spell,
3743000	3745000	and it pulled you towards your father.
3745000	3746000	Oh, right, right.
3746000	3749000	And it led you here, and then you encountered Yurch and fell in a hole.
3749000	3750000	And these are the bad gnolls.
3750000	3751000	I just read all this stuff.
3751000	3752000	The camp is the bad gnolls, right?
3752000	3753000	It's a bad gnoll camp.
3753000	3754000	Bad gnoll camp, yes.
3754000	3756000	But we're with a good gnoll guide.
3756000	3757000	Yeah, he ran away, though.
3757000	3760000	Remember, you pulled a sword on him, and then he ran away.
3760000	3761000	We pulled a sword on him?
3761000	3763000	Yeah.
3763000	3764000	Were we drunk?
3764000	3766000	Yeah, probably.
3766000	3768000	Do you remember pulling a sword on our guide?
3768000	3772000	Dude, all I remember was talking to squirrels.
3772000	3774000	It was good, yeah.
3774000	3775000	That's terrible.
3775000	3780000	So we know these are bad gnolls, but what's the reason we want to go in there?
3780000	3782000	Well, my dad is...
3782000	3783000	Is he a captive in there or something?
3783000	3784000	Well, here's what I remember.
3784000	3787000	My dad had a deal with the dwarves where...
3787000	3788000	Not the dwarves.
3788000	3794000	My dad had a deal with the good gnolls that they were going to go take out bad gnolls along the way.
3794000	3796000	This is what our good gnoll guide said.
3796000	3802000	And they were going to take out a bad gnoll camp, and that was going to be kind of like a quid pro quo thing.
3802000	3805000	I'll say it right later in ADR.
3805000	3809000	And then Neil will insist on it.
3809000	3811000	He's a very rigorous, post-productive director.
3811000	3812000	Neil Berkeley, everybody.
3812000	3815000	A famous filmmaker, documentarian.
3815000	3817000	Did you know that Wayne White wasn't even in Beauty is Embarrassing?
3817000	3818000	I didn't know that.
3818000	3820000	Neil made that character up.
3820000	3821000	Really?
3821000	3823000	He wear a fake beard.
3823000	3829000	And pretended to have worked on Pee Wee Herman and just shot himself the whole way.
3829000	3831000	He loves being on camera.
3831000	3833000	He loves being involved.
3833000	3836000	He's the Dan Harmon of documentarians.
3836000	3838000	He ends up making everything about himself.
3838000	3841000	He just rolls around in a bed of mirrors.
3842000	3844000	So many cuts.
3844000	3845000	So many cuts all over his body.
3845000	3848000	If Neil Berkeley ain't in it, it ain't a Neil Berkeley feature.
3848000	3850000	He chomps a cigar and says that.
3850000	3851000	That's on his car.
3851000	3852000	All right.
3852000	3853000	Stop it.
3853000	3856000	Can I use move silently to go into the cave?
3856000	3858000	Yeah, you can try and move silently.
3858000	3859000	Yeah, let's roll for it.
3859000	3860000	Ha ha!
3860000	3861000	Adventure.
3861000	3863000	Silent adventure.
3863000	3866000	You can't say things out loud when you're moving silently.
3866000	3868000	You just wasted a move silently.
3868000	3871000	You're making a bunch of ruckus.
3871000	3876000	Indeed, you do make a bunch of ruckus as you make your way towards the Knoll village.
3876000	3878000	Here we go.
3878000	3881000	Even still, no one seems to take notice of you.
3881000	3882000	All right.
3882000	3888000	You do notice flames licking the skins of the dwellings of the Knolls and smoke billows out into the sky.
3888000	3893000	You can hear the sounds of screaming and shouting and the ringing of clashing blades.
3893000	3894000	Uh oh.
3894000	3896000	Your dad's in there kicking ass right now.
3896000	3897000	He's been here.
3897000	3899000	Let's go in and help.
3899000	3904000	These licking flames remind me a lot of the belt that used to lick my ass.
3904000	3906000	Wait.
3906000	3907000	Your dad licked your ass?
3907000	3910000	No, his belt did.
3910000	3911000	His belt?
3911000	3912000	How do you know it was his belt?
3912000	3914000	It's a magical belt.
3914000	3919000	Because it was hard and held his pants up.
3919000	3921000	That's called his dick.
3921000	3924000	His dad hit him with a belt.
3924000	3927000	You weren't there.
3927000	3928000	I'm just going on what you give me.
3928000	3938000	Sharpie, I must confess, I am 4,000 years old and I was there.
3938000	3939000	Jesus.
3939000	3940000	Yes.
3940000	3942000	Her face is covered in vodka.
3942000	3950000	I feel like there's a battle going on and we owe it to the memory, at least, of the kinship of your father to go in there and help in this battle.
3950000	3951000	All right.
3951000	3952000	Let's head towards the fray.
3952000	3953000	Yes.
3953000	3954000	The arrows.
3954000	3955000	Let's go.
3955000	3960000	Shoot them one at a time.
3960000	3964000	Arriving at the village, you're met with a grisly scene.
3964000	3970000	Flames consume the tall grasses surrounding the bone dwellings and wooden furniture, animal hides, and all sorts are on fire.
3970000	3974000	A few of the huts are collapsed, as if devastated by a single blow.
3974000	3975000	And the corpses!
3975000	3981000	Noles lie slain in pools of their own blood, some with vicious gashes, others with broken backs and necks,
3981000	3984000	while others torn asunder or cleft in twain.
3984000	3988000	You hear the pounding of massive feet shaking the earth, and then you see them.
3988000	3991000	Lord Mango Butzalot.
3991000	3992000	Mango?
3992000	3993000	Mango?
3993000	3995000	Can I tee up his entrance?
3995000	3996000	Just let me look.
3996000	4003000	I'm looking at the corpses and I go, what dire force wrought this?
4003000	4006000	And then you hear the...
4006000	4008000	And the puddles of blood shiver, you know?
4008000	4009000	Yeah.
4009000	4010000	And then he's coming.
4011000	4018000	War Chief of the Butz Barbarians, standing seven feet tall, boasting three hundred and eighty pounds of raw muscle.
4018000	4023000	The barbarian chief's body is burning red with the bloodlust of a barbarian rage.
4023000	4028000	Clad in studded leather armor and wearing a dazzling and magnificent multicolored dream cloak.
4028000	4030000	Red, blue, and yellow.
4030000	4032000	The colors of the Butzalot tribe.
4032000	4036000	He also wears a great horned helmet and a dazzling magic belt.
4036000	4053000	Upon seeing you he charges, barreling at inhuman speeds towards you, swinging a massive anchor as easily as it were of small wood hatchet and wild, dangerous arcs.
4053000	4054000	He gets like this.
4054000	4055000	Run!
4055000	4059000	We have to wait for his berserker rage to settle out.
4059000	4069000	But I, as a fellow barbarian, recognize him and jump in the way of Lord Butzalot and Sharpie and say, no, this is Sharpie.
4069000	4078000	I will say that realizing you are a barbarian and you realize that you don't think you can stop a barbarian with words, but you can try that if you'd like.
4078000	4082000	It's like telling Adam Goldberg to come up on stage later.
4083000	4085000	Like it's not a...
4085000	4090000	Sorry, I can't use my word.
4090000	4091000	You definitely can.
4091000	4097000	I mean, I'm just telling you that you know barbarians being a barbarian and they get mindless.
4097000	4100000	I'm saying get out as quickly as I can.
4100000	4102000	I'm saying like he gets like this.
4102000	4104000	Like I was raised by a barbarian.
4104000	4105000	I get it.
4105000	4107000	Like let him, let him, let him peter out.
4107000	4109000	He's in a rage.
4109000	4111000	He's not going to, he's not going to understand anybody.
4111000	4114000	You get it, but you're also always fighting against it.
4115000	4116000	Fighting against what?
4116000	4117000	Him?
4117000	4118000	You.
4118000	4119000	What?
4119000	4120000	And him.
4123000	4129000	Not bothered by your idle chit chat, he charges, pulling into the group of the three of you.
4131000	4135000	He manages to knock Dan and Jeff high up into the air and they land flat on their backs.
4138000	4140000	You guys each take two damage.
4140000	4141000	What?
4141000	4142000	Motherfucker.
4142000	4143000	Can I use my bird?
4143000	4145000	You're going to kill me at level one.
4146000	4150000	Spencer, may I use my bird to deliver a message to Mango?
4150000	4152000	I don't think you have a bird.
4152000	4153000	I have a bird.
4153000	4154000	It says one bird.
4154000	4155000	Oh, that's a token.
4155000	4156000	Yeah.
4156000	4157000	Yeah, you could.
4157000	4158000	It's a man.
4158000	4159000	Okay.
4159000	4160000	She's talking about quals feather token.
4160000	4161000	You guys.
4161000	4164000	It's a, it's a magical item that summons a bird that can deliver a message.
4164000	4166000	That's what's happening right here.
4166000	4167000	Where's your behind the scenes?
4167000	4168000	I'm sorry.
4168000	4169000	No, no, no.
4169000	4171000	I'm just explaining the game because it's hard.
4171000	4172000	You're so frustrated.
4172000	4174000	I just sound like a little bitch sometimes.
4174000	4175000	Sorry.
4175000	4176000	No, no, no, no, no.
4176000	4177000	It's just, no, no.
4177000	4178000	I think it's advocate.
4178000	4179000	You know it sounds like a bird.
4179000	4182000	Mulrane, this is a perfect time to summon a bird.
4184000	4186000	Two of your friends lie flat on their back.
4186000	4187000	Yeah.
4187000	4188000	Go get that bird.
4189000	4194000	Well, I wanted to deliver a message to Mango and let him know that Butzalot is his, is
4194000	4196000	his son, the bird.
4196000	4198000	Use your mouth to deliver that message.
4198000	4199000	Shut up, Adam.
4200000	4207000	I mean, if my face doesn't deliver that message, I, my next available turn, I'll, I'll use
4207000	4209000	my mouth to deliver the message.
4209000	4216000	It's your turn by going, dad, your noises make no impact on his fragile brain.
4216000	4217000	Fragile?
4217000	4221000	So my bird, did my, did my bird never go?
4221000	4222000	You didn't say a message.
4222000	4224000	So do you want to say a message and then it'll happen?
4224000	4225000	Yes, yes.
4226000	4235000	The man that you see before you, the bearded, kind eyed.
4246000	4248000	Speed it up.
4250000	4253000	His, his face looks like you could treat him like a tweet.
4254000	4256000	140 characters or less.
4259000	4265000	The kind eyed, steel dicked man that you see before you is your son.
4268000	4272000	Is that what, what Ian McKellen whispered to that moth?
4273000	4276000	I always wondered what he was saying to that moth and Lord of the Rings.
4276000	4278000	Like he said some shit and then it went away.
4278000	4280000	And then I came back and like, what did he say?
4280000	4282000	Go get the eagles.
4283000	4286000	Tell him to come by at just the right time.
4286000	4288000	I can't believe Adam killed Big Red.
4288000	4297000	His lips are like soft valleys that giants roll in after long nights to massage their
4297000	4301000	backs because they're so soft.
4302000	4303000	Sorry guys.
4303000	4306000	There's a limit of a hundred words on the spell.
4306000	4307000	Aaron, the rules.
4307000	4310000	Aaron, the person that you see is your son.
4310000	4312000	That's, that's your son, that little beardy.
4312000	4313000	She said it.
4313000	4314000	She clicked send.
4314000	4315000	She did it.
4315000	4316000	She clicked send.
4316000	4321000	The coin transforms into a beautiful dove and flies right into the ear of Lord Mango
4321000	4322000	Butzalot.
4322000	4328000	You hear it tweeting softly and then he claps the side of his face and crumples and falls
4328000	4330000	to the ground.
4330000	4332000	Are you killing your dad?
4332000	4335000	The dad just killed the bird.
4335000	4336000	He heard your message.
4336000	4339000	You thought the dad crumbled to the ground?
4342000	4345000	Why would he kill a bird that talks?
4345000	4346000	He's crazy.
4346000	4349000	He's in a berserker rage you guys.
4349000	4352000	Butzalot, can I, can we just kill your dad?
4352000	4355000	He seems shitty.
4355000	4359000	He just killed a bird who tried to talk to him.
4359000	4362000	I cast mage armor.
4362000	4363000	You cast mage armor.
4363000	4366000	And I stand up and I look him right in the eye.
4366000	4369000	Prom night style.
4369000	4371000	I don't get the reference.
4371000	4373000	I don't see things.
4373000	4374000	Dan.
4374000	4375000	Sorry, Sharpie.
4375000	4377000	You sure you don't want to send another bird up there?
4377000	4379000	Not the movie prom night.
4379000	4383000	I mean the actual ritual prom night in all adolescence lives when you finally bear down
4383000	4386000	on your fucking dad because he won't give you the keys to the car because he didn't
4386000	4388000	clean your room and you're not supposed to go to prom.
4388000	4389000	Oh yeah.
4389000	4394000	Like actual, like, like, like looking gangly and ridiculous and having your first pubescent
4394000	4397000	like showdown with your alcoholic shitty.
4397000	4400000	Pubescent showdown is my favorite band.
4400000	4408000	All right, you cast mage armor.
4408000	4410000	You have a lot of favorite bands.
4410000	4413000	Get it out of your system old man.
4413000	4415000	You couldn't kill me when I was a kid.
4415000	4419000	Maybe you could finish the job now.
4419000	4421000	Glowing with magic light.
4421000	4424000	He turns and charges directly at you.
4424000	4426000	Right eyes bloodshot.
4426000	4432000	I hold my ground and squint my eyes because I'm a coward, but I've made my decision.
4432000	4435000	This is how I would like to die.
4435000	4436000	He hits the axe.
4436000	4437000	No, I'm sorry.
4437000	4438000	It's an anchor.
4438000	4442000	He swings the anchor in a wild arc and it strikes you directly in the chest.
4442000	4444000	He fights with an anchor?
4444000	4445000	Yeah.
4445000	4447000	It's like a belt for a boat.
4447000	4451000	Jesus Christ, my dad.
4451000	4456000	It strikes you with such force that it shatters your mage armor, dissipating it.
4456000	4461000	I go into a berserker rage and I attack him to defend my friend's honor.
4461000	4464000	It is adorable.
4464000	4466000	So you just jump on with your sword?
4466000	4469000	What's my crazy sword one?
4469000	4471000	My flaming sword?
4471000	4472000	Yeah, yeah.
4472000	4475000	I use my flaming sword and go into a rage and attack.
4475000	4480000	Pulling out your flaming sword from its sheath, you go into a rage.
4480000	4482000	It's real great.
4482000	4488000	Flying into an angry rage, you launch yourself full of adrenaline towards the barbarian warlord
4488000	4494000	and swing in a masterful clean stroke.
4494000	4498000	You miss shit harmlessly.
4498000	4503000	There's got to be some item from my childhood that I can show him like in a movie.
4503000	4507000	Cast magic scrapbook.
4507000	4511000	He never participated in my sticker collection.
4511000	4514000	That's half the reason I left.
4514000	4517000	Sharpie, didn't you hang out in his basement a lot?
4517000	4520000	His own work lair?
4520000	4525000	Isn't there some sort of token or memory from that that you could summon?
4525000	4527000	That's where you got hit by a belt.
4527000	4529000	That's like the place where it happened.
4529000	4531000	What did my mom call him?
4531000	4533000	Mango?
4533000	4535000	Aren't there some magazines?
4536000	4540000	When he hit me and he said my mage armor dispersed, was there any other effect?
4540000	4543000	Did it just take out the mage armor and I still stand?
4543000	4545000	You didn't die, right?
4545000	4547000	But did it hurt me?
4547000	4548000	It did not.
4548000	4550000	No, the mage armor took the brunt of your attack there.
4550000	4552000	So I say, hit me again.
4552000	4554000	I'm your son.
4554000	4556000	He doesn't respond to your words.
4556000	4557000	He's in a mindless rage.
4557000	4563000	His tongue lulls and his eyes roll around in his sockets and he unleashes a mighty roar.
4563000	4571000	Okay, I shoot an arrow at Mango.
4571000	4574000	You shoot an arrow from your bow.
4574000	4577000	You strike Mango right in the chest.
4577000	4580000	You guys know this is my dad.
4580000	4587000	I wanted to say in a different area other than his chest, but he has a big chest, right?
4587000	4590000	Where are my spells?
4590000	4593000	Where am I?
4593000	4596000	Come on, don't bully me.
4596000	4598000	So is Mango willing to talk now?
4598000	4601000	No, he's not.
4601000	4605000	He charges like a wounded animal despite taking 14 non-lethal damage.
4605000	4609000	It's just like Dan's dad, hard skin for no reason, Mango.
4609000	4614000	Charm person fails to effect mindless ragers.
4614000	4616000	I use diplomacy.
4616000	4618000	You can use diplomacy.
4618000	4623000	I get diplomatic all over him.
4623000	4625000	You fail to get diplomatic all over him.
4625000	4626000	I am. This is not my day.
4626000	4627000	I'm sorry, you guys.
4627000	4628000	The dice are sucking.
4628000	4629000	Guys, I'm sorry.
4629000	4630000	I'm a real piece of shit today.
4630000	4634000	I shoot an arrow at his feet, like both of his feet.
4634000	4642000	I wait till I'm parallel so I can shoot both of his feet with this same arrow.
4642000	4644000	Yes, and then to the other foot.
4644000	4648000	It's like it's a little, like, real world road wills challenge
4648000	4651000	where your feet are tied together.
4651000	4653000	That's a pretty tough shot to nail there.
4653000	4657000	Yeah, a pretty shitty reference, but yeah.
4657000	4659000	You fail to meet your mind.
4659000	4665000	Hypnotism.
4665000	4667000	Is that one of your things that you just want to talk about?
4667000	4668000	Can I reject that?
4668000	4669000	Okay.
4669000	4670000	You want to go to drive-thru?
4670000	4671000	Sleep.
4671000	4672000	Sleep.
4672000	4674000	He's entitled to a will save.
4674000	4676000	Oh shit.
4676000	4680000	He falls asleep.
4680000	4683000	I had to learn to do that.
4683000	4685000	That's my origin story.
4685000	4690000	Take his belt off while he's sleeping.
4690000	4692000	Jesus, you guys, that's my dad.
4692000	4694000	You shot arrows at his chest.
4694000	4696000	So Manko's asleep right now?
4696000	4697000	He's asleep.
4697000	4699000	I run up and take his anchor away from him.
4699000	4701000	Wait, don't do anything...
4701000	4703000	I'm just disarming him.
4703000	4705000	Friends are going to think we're trying to kill him.
4705000	4708000	I run up and I thrust at his head like I'm humping him
4708000	4711000	and then I giggle and I run away and I'm embarrassed.
4711000	4714000	I look around for allies of my father.
4714000	4720000	I take a post-it note, draw a dick at balls, put it on his forehead.
4720000	4724000	You succeed.
4724000	4725000	Nice.
4725000	4729000	I put his hand in a cup of warm water.
4729000	4731000	I'm not going to fly.
4731000	4736000	I put some dog shit on his finger and tickled his nose.
4736000	4738000	There's no dog shit.
4738000	4741000	Let's just write racist on his forehead.
4741000	4743000	Take an Instagram.
4743000	4748000	Sharpie, do you want us to defeat him or do you want him to join us?
4748000	4751000	My first order of business was to get him to stop killing us.
4751000	4754000	Second on that list, though, is to not have us kill him.
4754000	4756000	That's my dad.
4756000	4757000	Came here to meet him.
4757000	4758000	Of course.
4758000	4762000	I run around for his attendance.
4762000	4764000	You don't see any attendance.
4764000	4767000	The burning Nolan campment seems rather barren.
4767000	4771000	It seems like everyone who could die is already dead.
4771000	4775000	Can I give Mango Betzel up my bedroll?
4775000	4777000	Yeah, well, he's unconscious so he can't accept it
4777000	4779000	like you could place it on him or something.
4779000	4781000	Yeah, I'm going to...
4781000	4783000	You could tuck him in, I guess.
4783000	4784000	Ball rain.
4784000	4785000	Ball rain.
4785000	4787000	Put a bedroll on him.
4787000	4789000	Here's my sincere advice.
4789000	4790000	He was in a berserker rage.
4790000	4792000	That's why everyone here is dead.
4792000	4794000	That's why he's the leader of his tribe.
4794000	4797000	He's not himself when he's in that mode.
4797000	4800000	If we tie him up and take all his shit when he wakes up,
4800000	4803000	he'll actually be pissed at us normal, like sober.
4803000	4806000	If we just let him have his shit, he'll wake up normal.
4806000	4809000	He's not going to be in a berserker rage when he wakes up.
4809000	4810000	He'll be normal.
4810000	4811000	He's still my dad.
4811000	4812000	He's not going to kill us when he wakes up.
4812000	4815000	Sharpie, when was the last time that you and your dad
4815000	4816000	had a really nice time together?
4816000	4817000	Should we try to recreate that?
4817000	4820000	Well, I don't want to play the blame game.
4820000	4821000	You know, I'm not...
4821000	4823000	I don't come from that school of therapy.
4823000	4825000	It wasn't a positive relationship.
4825000	4828000	I left and became a wizard, but, you know...
4828000	4829000	But I mean, was there a time...
4829000	4831000	Like, your last good memory with him?
4831000	4833000	Like, can we position him in a certain way?
4833000	4835000	I don't think there's any manipulating this guy.
4835000	4837000	I think he's kind of salt of the earth type,
4837000	4839000	and manipulation is more...
4839000	4842000	Well, like, can we eat his organs?
4843000	4849000	I feel like I'm talking to, like, artificial intelligence.
4849000	4854000	I don't know what you're saying has to do with what I'm saying, but...
4854000	4857000	But my recommendation is that we prop the guy up
4857000	4859000	in a comfortable position with his weapons at hand
4859000	4861000	and wait for him to wake up, a normal guy.
4861000	4863000	He's not going to like me when he wakes up,
4863000	4865000	but he's not going to try to kill us.
4865000	4866000	He's my dad.
4866000	4868000	I summon a squirrel.
4869000	4871000	You can...
4871000	4874000	It's the same day as the last day we met,
4874000	4876000	and you can only cast Speak with Animals once per day.
4876000	4877000	Oh, okay.
4877000	4878000	He loves animals.
4878000	4880000	I'll bite my time.
4883000	4885000	I have a flashback.
4885000	4887000	You have a flashback.
4887000	4888000	To when?
4888000	4889000	Ten years old.
4889000	4890000	Ten years old.
4892000	4897000	I choose Jeff Davis to play the role of young Lord Butzalot,
4897000	4904000	a barbarian in the tower of wherever I grew up when I was ten.
4904000	4905000	I'll play the tower.
4909000	4912000	Why is there a vodka all over this tower?
4912000	4915000	Goddamn it, I've been working all day,
4915000	4918000	but kicking Noel's asses is a son of a bitch.
4918000	4919000	Father.
4919000	4920000	What?
4920000	4922000	I've been thinking about what you said.
4922000	4924000	I don't give two shit.
4925000	4927000	I don't pay you to think.
4927000	4928000	I don't even pay him.
4930000	4933000	You said that I'd never make a good barbarian.
4933000	4934000	I know that.
4934000	4935000	Look at you.
4935000	4936000	You don't have the forearms.
4936000	4937000	But what if...
4940000	4942000	What if magic, Father?
4942000	4943000	Magic.
4945000	4946000	Bloody duh.
4948000	4949000	I like magic.
4949000	4950000	It's not like that.
4950000	4953000	I'm going to go hang out with Patton Oswalt at magic parties.
4955000	4959000	Magic can be used to defeat monsters and gain treasure same as barbarism.
4959000	4962000	Show me some magic right now and prove it to me.
4964000	4966000	You just poop in the carpet.
4966000	4967000	That's not magic.
4967000	4969000	That's disgusting.
4970000	4972000	Anyone can poop in the carpet.
4972000	4975000	Look, I cast magic fart.
4976000	4978000	I need to go abroad and study it.
4978000	4979000	It won't work.
4979000	4980000	That's what I'm saying.
4980000	4983000	Well, so being a barbarian is not good enough for you, huh?
4983000	4984000	I didn't say that.
4984000	4985000	I'm not good enough.
4985000	4986000	You always say I'm not good enough.
4986000	4987000	You're not good enough.
4987000	4988000	Let me be good enough.
4988000	4990000	Let me do what I'm good at.
4990000	4992000	I'm made of stone.
4997000	4999000	We live in a magic tower.
4999000	5002000	Why can't I go to a magic place and play my trade?
5002000	5003000	You know what?
5003000	5004000	Do it.
5004000	5005000	You go.
5005000	5007000	You go.
5008000	5009000	Just leave.
5010000	5015000	And I'll see you in about 15 years, 20 years.
5015000	5016000	And you'll be proud of me.
5016000	5017000	Yeah.
5017000	5018000	Well, maybe I will.
5018000	5019000	Maybe I won't.
5020000	5024000	Maybe I'll be too busy saving the world from evil mole gangs.
5024000	5028000	And maybe I won't care about magic because maybe magic doesn't put bread on the table.
5028000	5032000	Maybe sometimes using your big forearms does.
5033000	5035000	Magic can totally put bread on the table.
5035000	5036000	Do it.
5036000	5037000	Show me.
5037000	5038000	Not early in my life.
5038000	5039000	Show me right now.
5041000	5043000	Don't poop on this table, son.
5044000	5047000	Get out of my weird drunk castle.
5048000	5049000	I cast I hate you.
5049000	5051000	I'd never want to see you again.
5051000	5052000	Again.
5052000	5053000	Again.
5053000	5054000	Again.
5054000	5055000	Again.
5055000	5056000	Again.
5059000	5062000	You snap back into the real world.
5062000	5069000	You feel a confusing mix of emotions, of passions, of adrenaline, of memories, of timelines
5069000	5071000	weaving past and present.
5071000	5073000	You level up.
5078000	5080000	Flash back, level up.
5080000	5082000	Flash back, level up.
5082000	5085000	You can level up by having a memory.
5086000	5088000	That's the best D&D game ever.
5088000	5089000	All right.
5089000	5090000	Let's have it for Spencer.
5090000	5092000	Let's end there when we level up.
5093000	5094000	That's right.
5094000	5096000	Stop in a video game when we level up.
5096000	5098000	Take our time to pick those new skills.
5098000	5099000	Absolutely.
5099000	5100000	Spencer, everybody.
5101000	5102000	All right.
5103000	5104000	Eric McGathey.
5109000	5110000	I didn't know.
5110000	5114000	You know, Neil, who doesn't exist, had to say to me, I think D&D is the highlight.
5114000	5116000	I think you've got to figure out a way to play D&D on the road.
5116000	5120000	You mean Neil Berkeley, the megalomaniac filmmaker?
5120000	5122000	The Dennis Hopper of documentaries?
5122000	5124000	The Morgan Spurlock of our movie?
5124000	5127000	Man, I don't know what you intended to do, but I'm in this thing.
5128000	5129000	It's about me now.
5129000	5134000	I mean, I wish my name was Neil Berkeley, because it's got me in it.
5135000	5136000	And I.
5140000	5142000	There's no Neil in team.
5143000	5145000	There's some of it, but you'd have to deconstruct it.
5145000	5147000	That's all I'm going to do.
5149000	5153000	I'm just saying, like, as an example of it, you know, he's sitting at three Amstel's.
5153000	5156000	I'm still trying to get him to agree to do the thing.
5156000	5158000	He immediately mentions D&D is the thing.
5158000	5160000	It gave me a renewed vigor.
5160000	5163000	I think we played better D&D tonight because.
5163000	5164000	Stains are higher.
5164000	5166000	And like, yeah, it's like.
5166000	5167000	Because we're going on an actual campaign.
5167000	5170000	You and I are going on an actual campaign.
5171000	5174000	In search of riches and glory.
5175000	5176000	Yeah.
5176000	5178000	Can I describe it dramatically?
5178000	5179000	Oh, I wish you would.
5179000	5180000	Yes.
5180000	5181000	Well, not like I'm just in general.
5181000	5182000	Not right now.
5183000	5189000	Oh, I thought you play the D&D queue and have a cramped tour bus on a state highway somewhere.
5189000	5190000	Yeah.
5195000	5196000	I hit the wrong button.
5196000	5198000	It's come that time in the Harmon Town show.
5198000	5200000	Oh, that sounded like a good.
5200000	5203000	That's what we lack in our show.
5203000	5206000	It has that kind of like, hey, bring it at home.
5206000	5208000	So the audience would go, OK, the show's fucking over.
5208000	5212000	I don't have to steal myself against the possibility of this being three and a half hours long.
5214000	5217000	The good thing about the show is the energy is freewheeling.
5217000	5220000	But the only downside of that is always the paying the piper at the end.
5220000	5222000	Because they go, like, who's going to end it?
5222000	5223000	He deluded to it.
5223000	5224000	You are, Dan.
5224000	5225000	So what have we learned?
5227000	5229000	What have we learned in tonight's Harmon Town?
5233000	5234000	We learned.
5239000	5243000	We learned that Neil doesn't want to be in the movie that he's shooting.
5244000	5247000	But that he will be the star of it by not being in it.
5248000	5250000	We learned that Adam.
5251000	5253000	We didn't learn shit about Adam.
5253000	5255000	We didn't learn anything about Adam.
5255000	5258000	But we learned to be afraid of him.
5259000	5260000	If we didn't know that already.
5260000	5265000	We learned that women and gay people and black people are the best people in the world.
5265000	5266000	Right, Tennessee?
5270000	5271000	God, fuck you, buddy.
5271000	5272000	Hey, motherfucker.
5272000	5274000	I'm sure you should have heard a fuck again.
5276000	5278000	We learned that Greg Barrett is our Marvel enemy.
5278000	5281000	We learned that I have a lot to learn about going on the road.
5281000	5283000	That I still have one more week to prepare.
5284000	5289000	We learned that Dave Matthews will happily shit in your head because they have no regard for human safety.
5290000	5295000	And we learned that we learned to fuck your mama.
5296000	5297000	No, no, no.
5303000	5304000	Wait.
5308000	5309000	Yo, yo, yo.
5309000	5310000	End of the show.
5310000	5313000	Yo, yo, yo.
5313000	5314000	Yo, yo.
5314000	5315000	End of the show.
5315000	5316000	Fuck your mama.
5316000	5318000	Gonna learn and grow.
5318000	5320000	Fuck your mama and her knee and her foot.
5320000	5322000	Fuck your mama's chimney.
5322000	5323000	Got the soot.
5323000	5324000	I'm a dick.
5324000	5326000	Fuck your mama's wick.
5326000	5328000	She's a candle and I'm gonna get sick.
5328000	5330000	Keep your mama up out of my mouth.
5330000	5333000	Fuck your mama in the east, west, north, and south.
5333000	5336000	Fuck your mama from the salt to the pepper.
5336000	5339000	Fuck your mama and I'm not a pepper.
5340000	5341000	It's not a word.
5341000	5342000	That's why I'm not it.
5342000	5343000	It's not a word.
5343000	5344000	Fuck your mama.
5344000	5346000	Get the butt and the head.
5346000	5348000	Fuck your mama and your daddy instead.
5348000	5351000	Start at fucking your daddy to even it out.
5351000	5354000	Fuck your daddy and his nose and his mouth.
5354000	5356000	Apostrophe T.
5357000	5358000	Mouth.
5359000	5361000	You meant, let me get, yo.
5361000	5363000	I need a topic.
5363000	5364000	I need a topic, yo.
5364000	5365000	Eyes.
5365000	5366000	Eyes.
5366000	5367000	I fucked your mama's eyes.
5367000	5369000	I fucked your mama and it was a big surprise.
5369000	5372000	I fucked your mama and her brow and her nose.
5372000	5374000	I fucked your mama because that's how the eyes goes.
5374000	5377000	I fucked your mama in the middle of the face.
5377000	5379000	I fucked your mama all over the place.
5379000	5380000	I fucked your mama on the left.
5380000	5382000	I fucked your mama on the right.
5382000	5383000	I fucked your mama in the morning.
5383000	5384000	Didn't fuck her at night.
5384000	5387000	Let her think about it.
5387000	5389000	Didn't you—
5391000	5393000	I fucked your mama on the right.
5393000	5394000	I fucked her in the morning.

5412000	5414000	Next time. Next week. Next week.
5416000	5419000	I'm Jeff Davis. Dan Harmon.
5419000	5423000	Thank you, Adam Goldberg, Spencer, and McGathey.
5423000	5427000	Neil Berkley, who really, really is just running roughshod over the show.
5427000	5430000	It's getting uncomfortable how involved he is in it.
5430000	5433000	Neil, if we could get five minutes with you, not on our dick up here.
5433000	5434000	That'd be terrific.
5434000	5436000	Also, Katie Levine, our audio recording.

5452000	5453000	We will see you next time.
5453000	5454000	Maybe Chevy Chase?
5454000	5455000	Maybe not.
5455000	5456000	We as well shall see.
5457000	5464000	How about one more good one for Dan Harmon, your mayor.
5464000	5467000	Fuck your mom.
5467000	5471000	Fuck your mom.
5471000	5473000	He's made it clear.
5473000	5476000	I fucked your mom.
5476000	5480000	Went to her house and fucked her.
5480000	5483000	You've been pretty.
5484000	5488000	Candid about the fact that you fucked their mom.
5488000	5491000	I think I need to expound.
5491000	5498000	Fucked your mom so many times in ways you don't understand.
5498000	5503000	It was sublime.
5503000	5506000	This has been closing past the cell.
5506000	5508000	Or selling past the clothes, whatever the fuck you call it.
5508000	5510000	Good night, all.
5514000	5516000	Punching holes in your Harmon town cards over there.
5516000	5520000	I know that some of you are this close to a freebie.
5527000	5529000	You just have to do a good bow, Dan.
5529000	5531000	Dan, come out and bow again.
5531000	5532000	Dan.
5532000	5533000	Encore.
5533000	5534000	You guys want an encore, right?
5534000	5535000	Yeah, come on.
5535000	5537000	One more try for Dan Harmon, everybody.
5537000	5539000	Do a big bow.
5544000	5547000	Thank you, Los Angeles.
5547000	5551000	Or Filler City, if we're using this to fill in a city.
5551000	5553000	Thank you, city.
5553000	5554000	Dan, Dan.
5554000	5555000	We're a city.
5555000	5559000	Dan, close with an apology to Phoenix when we're going there first.
5559000	5561000	I'm so sorry, Phoenix.
5561000	5562000	So sorry we went there first.
5562000	5563000	What?
5563000	5564000	They hate us.
5564000	5566000	We were pretty hard on Phoenix earlier.
5566000	5567000	Phoenix, Phoenix, I'm sorry.
5567000	5568000	Phoenix, it's okay.
5568000	5570000	We're going to be fine.
5571000	5572000	I don't know.
5574000	5576000	We'll do some wild stuff now.
5576000	5579000	And that's how you make a statue disappear.
5581000	5583000	Is this your card?
5583000	5584000	There's no card.
5584000	5586000	Disappeared twice.
5588000	5591000	You motherfucker, I'm going to fucking rape your soul.
5596000	5598000	Who would have thought we'd end up in London?
5598000	5600000	Whoa!
5602000	5606000	Thanks for having us on SNL as we pass through New York.
5608000	5610000	This city has the best zoo I've ever seen.
5610000	5613000	It's so uncruel to animals.
5613000	5615000	Fuck San Diego.
5615000	5619000	San Diego's got the best zoo in the world.
5619000	5622000	Don't forget the veterans.
5622000	5624000	Spin on them.
5624000	5625000	Depending on...
5625000	5627000	I don't know what cities are...
5627000	5629000	We'll mop it up later.
