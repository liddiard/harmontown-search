0	17760	Hollywood, California, the Nerd Mel Theater and Meltdown Comics, the 200th Harmon Town
18400	19760	is now in session.
30760	33760	Let's bring us Spencer Clinton, everybody.
42760	45760	Do we bring out Rob or do we bring out Dan first?
48760	52760	Let's bring out Dan Harmon, the mayor, and let them make that decision.
52760	55760	Let's bring out Dan Harmon, the mayor, and let them make that decision.
82760	90760	The media knows no bounds, souls are lost, but highways are bound to inroads,
90760	98760	and problematization of the nation's new, and immigration, and I'm scoping,
98760	105760	I'm not joking, I'm scoping, I'm smoking, I'm hoping with you.
105760	124760	Periscope, what will you do? Periscope, Periscope, looking up to the world,
124760	132760	from the submarine and privacy, waging war on the Nazis, the U-boats,
132760	142760	when there's stockades, I mean blockades, I mean shockade, drink the shockade.
142760	157760	Periscope, Periscope, looking up to Periscope, looking up, Periscope.
162760	177760	It's incredible.
177760	182760	Dan, it took us 200 episodes to find out that you were a great rock and roller.
182760	185760	And a big fan of Periscope.
185760	190760	Yeah, we've been doing bad rap for a long time now.
190760	194760	It should have been Jordy White from Manson and from Perfect Circle.
194760	201760	What else do you got? Let's do our 200th episode theme.
201760	206760	All right, so you got something a little slower, a little more ballady.
206760	211760	I usually ask when our friends make music for us for it to be a little bit more driven.
211760	216760	Let me see here.
216760	220760	This is by Johnny Polonsky, a good friend. Is that going to work for you?
220760	230760	Periscope.
230760	233760	Oh, it's lyrics.
233760	238760	It's not going to work.
238760	242760	Yeah, you can just keep holding it like that.
242760	249760	The thing is, our friend Titanic and our friend Jordy, they have all kinds of slow music I didn't put on there because I never use it.
249760	255760	Episode 201, no, I'll be in London, but episode 203.
255760	259760	I remember how great episode 199 was. I mean, really.
259760	265760	We're covered. Was I here? Yeah, I was here.
265760	269760	Isn't it weird, though, because it feels like you're showing people things, but you're filming them.
269760	273760	It makes you feel like you're a game show hostess.
273760	280760	You just turned a woman in the front row into your creepy webcam lady.
280760	284760	Yeah, you have a look of utter distaste in your face right now.
284760	289760	All right, well, we'll sing the 200th episode song later.
289760	292760	All right, well, let's talk about...
292760	295760	Take his credit card.
295760	302760	All right, we're going to stop Periscope down because you can watch us on harmontown.com live for free.
302760	308760	It says, please don't stop this.
308760	311760	Don't listen to them.
311760	315760	But now that they're going to be typing and they know that you're not going to be listening.
315760	316760	Well, what are they saying?
316760	319760	But they're all talking to each other. They're all seeing it, right?
319760	321760	Are they all seeing each other's scopes?
321760	324760	I mean, these people are just hardcore Periscope fans.
324760	329760	I've never seen this before in my life. I'm kind of excited.
329760	331760	Hey, NT, how's it going?
331760	334760	See this? NT right in the front row.
334760	338760	Yeah, that's some 200 episode shit right there.
338760	340760	Is that going to be upside down now?
340760	343760	It'll be fine.
343760	346760	There. Now stop complaining.
346760	351760	Don't these Periscope people know that tonight is the only time it's free to watch the live stream for everybody in the world?
351760	353760	They love Periscope.
353760	356760	You don't try to dictate how people see stuff.
356760	358760	That's why people have failed to monetize the internet.
358760	359760	You don't understand.
359760	360760	It's a trough.
360760	363760	If you love bacon, go to the pig.
363760	366760	He's just faking like, you know, you don't, you don't just, you don't...
378760	382760	What if, what if Shropp never actually came out on stage?
382760	386760	What if he just stood there the whole time?
386760	389760	For those of you not watching, Shropp is lurking.
389760	390760	He's buttoning his shirt.
390760	391760	He puts some glasses on.
391760	395760	I think he means business.
395760	399760	He looks, he looks a little angry.
399760	400760	He looks like he might...
400760	404760	Is there something in his mouth?
404760	407760	He's rolling his sleeves up.
407760	412760	Again, we're making podcast history with all this visual gags.
412760	414760	All right.
414760	418760	He only wants to leave him.
418760	421760	I got to have somewhere to go with the rest of the show.
421760	426760	Well, come up and sit down then, I guess.
426760	429760	I'll stand.
429760	432760	The people behind you paid $10.
432760	437760	To look at my ass.
437760	439760	I'm going to sit next to Spence.
439760	445760	Let's get another chair.
445760	447760	I feel a little embarrassed because it feels like Rob expected there to be more
447760	449760	of a hoopla just from CNN.
449760	452760	So that's why he had to just start buttoning and rolling things.
452760	454760	Because he was like, shit, what do I do?
454760	456760	I thought standing, oh, for sure, just for a period.
456760	458760	He came over and he was behind a pillar.
458760	459760	Most of the crowd...
459760	460760	No, no, no.
460760	462760	You don't know what I was thinking.
462760	465760	He doesn't even have a chair.
465760	468760	No, no, Jeff, I got this.
468760	469760	He doesn't know what I'm thinking.
469760	471760	You didn't know what I was thinking.
471760	474760	Everything went exactly the way I wanted it to.
474760	481760	Exactly the way I wanted it to.
481760	488760	But it doesn't matter because we're all in a simulation.
488760	493760	As confirmed by Elon Musk, a hero to probably all of my listeners.
493760	496760	Didn't he just say that there's a chance that we're in a simulation?
496760	501760	No, he said there's a very, very slim chance we're not.
501760	506760	And that we probably are in a thousandth simulation deep inside a simulation.
506760	510760	We're probably one of the things a chess computer thinks it might do
510760	513760	before it decides to make its real move.
513760	518760	We're probably not even the actual fake artificial thing that's going to happen.
518760	524760	We're probably a hypothetical algorithmic exploration of a possibility.
524760	528760	You think the chess algorithm, Deep Blue,
528760	531760	or whatever that was when he was playing, whoever it was, Spassky,
531760	532760	or who did he play?
532760	533760	Spassky.
533760	534760	It was Kasparov.
534760	537760	It was Kasbro.
537760	539760	Do you think that when the computer's like,
539760	542760	okay, I'm going to go through the motions of thinking about my next move,
542760	544760	I'm like, should I just tell him?
544760	546760	Right now.
546760	549760	I'm the more advanced.
549760	551760	When does that change anything?
551760	553760	How does that change anything?
553760	555760	I still got to go to work in the morning.
555760	557760	How does that change anything?
557760	560760	It's a simulated job now.
560760	561760	It's nice.
561760	562760	I think it's an improvement.
562760	566760	I would rather think of myself as entering oblivion,
566760	573760	having taken part in some kind of artificial man-made or lady-made.
573760	575760	Lady.
575760	577760	If they're advanced enough to simulate a universe,
577760	582760	there could be women working in computer science.
582760	585760	I'm just saying man-woman versus man or lady.
585760	588760	I'm classy.
588760	592760	I may be a feminist, but I still have my charms.
592760	594760	Who wants to go for a free pond?
594760	596760	I'm a free pond type of feminist.
596760	598760	I'm like, I'm going to fuck you on the floor
598760	602760	and leave with your boyfriend's Porsche feminist.
602760	606760	I'm a casino royale feminist.
606760	613760	I'm a feminist in that I will let you run your tears down my washboard
613760	618760	as I emerge from the saltwater ocean with my diamond-hard nipples
618760	619760	flicking your eyes out.
619760	621760	We're finding out our bicentennial episode.
621760	622760	You're a rock and roll.
622760	624760	You're kind of a tough kickass.
624760	628760	I'm kind of a tough-on-the-ladies feminist.
628760	631760	It's a new thing.
631760	632760	You know who else was?
632760	635760	Barn fucking Jovi.
635760	636760	That's right.
636760	640760	Yeah, he told them I'm a cowboy.
640760	643760	He didn't mean literally.
643760	645760	He meant I'm not going to call you back.
645760	647760	And they were like, thank you.
647760	649760	Because I'm not always just into relationships.
649760	652760	Sometimes I just want to fuck Barn Jovi.
652760	655760	Why do you think he was wanted dead or alive?
655760	656760	What did he do?
656760	657760	Did he rob a bank?
657760	659760	Because he rides on a steel horse.
659760	661760	Oh, that's illegal now?
661760	666760	The death penalty for riding on a steel horse?
666760	668760	Shit.
668760	670760	I got him back-to-back now.
670760	672760	Those sentences, better alive.
672760	673760	It's not a highway.
673760	676760	It's not road legal, but a steel horse.
676760	679760	He didn't have a helmet on.
679760	683760	I think what he meant was that he feels like a piece of meat.
683760	686760	It's like when John Lennon said, the way things are going,
686760	687760	they're going to crucify me.
687760	690760	It's like when you're at the peak of your rock and rollness.
690760	691760	Back me up, Spencer.
691760	693760	You're like, aw.
693760	696760	Aw, man.
696760	697760	Aw, shit.
698760	700760	I feel bad now.
700760	701760	I feel bad.
701760	702760	I feel bad.
702760	703760	We feel bad.
703760	704760	We feel bad now.
704760	706760	We feel so bad.
706760	708760	I don't know if you guys know the difference between
708760	710760	back-up and interruption.
710760	711760	No, I do.
711760	713760	We don't.
713760	714760	I totally do.
714760	715760	Right, yeah.
715760	716760	No, we get it.
716760	718760	I think he's just saying like,
718760	721760	I don't think people even care that I'm a human being.
721760	723760	That's what he means, wanted dead or alive.
723760	726760	You'd want me even if this next song was bad.
726760	728760	Like, that is the Cobain thing.
728760	730760	It's like, I don't even know anymore.
730760	732760	I went and saw Bon Jovi a couple times for some reason,
732760	734760	and when he came out on stage,
734760	737760	he came out on stage and I was sitting next to a woman
737760	738760	and her daughter.
738760	740760	And the woman was probably like,
740760	743760	I wouldn't say maybe late 40s.
743760	747760	And the daughter was, you know, 18 or 19 or whatever.
747760	752760	Like, the woman was, somebody whistled, that's good.
752760	755760	So anyway, I'm fucking him.
755760	759760	And I mean, damn, I mean, Bon Jovi style.
759760	761760	On a steel horse.
761760	763760	Maybe the woman was a little bit older than that
763760	765760	and the daughter was also a little bit older
765760	769760	because neither of them was primetime Bon Jovi fan age.
769760	771760	But the daughter was there to see the bands
771760	773760	because she heard about them.
773760	775760	Because I guess the 80s was coming back, you know,
775760	777760	like, for you people.
777760	779760	And I was talking to the mom, she's like,
779760	781760	I didn't even know this band.
781760	783760	She plays them, she loves them.
783760	787760	When Bon Jovi came on stage, she was like a young girl
787760	788760	at an Elvis concert.
788760	790760	It was just, she screamed as much as anybody there.
790760	792760	That was amazing to watch.
792760	795760	Like, whatever you like or don't like about Bon Jovi's music,
795760	798760	he's got great blonde hair and he's got, he's just buns.
798760	800760	It's all about buns.
800760	802760	So you've got to have him rock and roll, Dan.
802760	805760	Great hair, buns.
805760	810760	His hair is in buns?
810760	813760	If he put his hair in more buns, that would be amazing.
813760	815760	If he put his hair in one bun.
815760	817760	Is he back? Okay.
817760	820760	Well, I'm a periscopers, I'm going to shut you down
820760	824760	because you can watch it at harmontown.com live
824760	828760	and you've probably figured out how boring the periscope could be by now.
828760	830760	There's like five cameras on the other thing.
830760	833760	Stop being so sluggishly periscope.
833760	835760	Sorry, audience.
835760	838760	It's like they're admitting they're in a submarine.
838760	841760	They're in a tube in the bottom of the sea.
841760	843760	How do you... Oh, stop.
843760	846760	I thought you hated social media. She knows how to work it?
846760	849760	You just don't like it. Okay.
849760	853760	She just resents that it knows how to work her, you know?
853760	857760	From a societal perspective, it sounded sexual.
857760	863760	This is why they went like, whoa, he's giving her the green light.
863760	865760	But you know what I meant.
865760	869760	I meant in like a David Bowie way, which is never sexual.
872760	876760	We're in a simulation. I think that's about it.
876760	878760	That's such bullshit, man.
878760	883760	Don't scientists make fun of like religious people for having ridiculous beliefs?
883760	884760	It's so stupid.
884760	887760	How is that better than, oh, there's magic people all around
887760	889760	and they get that back to life?
889760	890760	What about the gnomes?
890760	892760	Well, I mean...
892760	895760	We're in a simulation, but there's no fucking gnomes?
895760	903760	Yeah. If we were simulated right now, we would have some talking gnomes in the backyard.
903760	909760	If we're a simulation, we should be mad that we're in a gnomalous, dragonless simulation.
909760	912760	We got stuck in a shit simulation.
912760	915760	I think you guys should be stoked that we're in a gnomalous, dragonless simulation
915760	918760	because you know what that probably means, that it's closer to reality
918760	926760	which means that we're the simulation that may prove that it's possible to simulate a reality from within a simulation.
926760	928760	We could really butter our bread with this one.
928760	932760	We could be headed for the major simulation leagues.
932760	937760	They could bump us up to a thumb drive that they sell in their best buys
937760	941760	or their weird alien world where women are equals.
941760	943760	All right. Our next guest...
943760	945760	Yeah, I'll take a chair.
945760	947760	All right. All right.
947760	951760	Our next guest was peeing while we were talking for the last five minutes,
951760	953760	but right before I was going to bring him up.
953760	954760	So let's bring him out now.
954760	955760	Rob Cordry's back.
969760	972760	I'm going to sit in a chair like a normal guest.
973760	974760	Yeah.
974760	977760	Shrob, you're taking a big liberty.
980760	983760	You're exercising a liberty over there.
983760	988760	I think Rob is such a director and so completely conniving a Machiavellian.
988760	991760	I think he found a camera here in our mix that he really liked.
991760	994760	I think he knows he's being hit by Spencer's cam.
994760	997760	And he's in a sexy two-shot at all times right now.
997760	999760	I wore this red plaid.
1000760	1003760	That's why you entered from stage right.
1003760	1006760	That's the only shirt I ever see you wear.
1006760	1009760	I know. It's my default shirt.
1009760	1013760	Either that or my default jacket that goes over my default shirt.
1013760	1016760	Does tonight feel like a default shirt kind of event, Rob?
1016760	1018760	Our 200th episode?
1018760	1020760	Rob, grab a microphone.
1020760	1021760	Yeah.
1021760	1022760	Yes.
1022760	1024760	Oh, grab a microphone?
1024760	1025760	Jesus Christ.
1025760	1026760	You want me to be louder?
1026760	1029760	This is, damn, this fucking ship is sinking.
1029760	1030760	I know.
1030760	1032760	It's fucking, it's our 200th.
1032760	1034760	It's just a bit, Norman Lear was here.
1034760	1037760	He spent the first 20 minutes doing a fucking improvised culture.
1037760	1039760	It's not my 200th show.
1039760	1041760	It's not my 200th show.
1041760	1043760	If this was my 200th show.
1043760	1045760	This isn't my 200th show.
1045760	1046760	It's your 200th show.
1046760	1050760	I can wear, I'll wear a fucking tuxedo on my 200th show.
1053760	1055760	But you won't have one.
1055760	1056760	Right.
1056760	1059760	Because you host, I host and you feed on me.
1059760	1060760	Yes.
1060760	1061760	You feed on me.
1061760	1062760	Yes.
1062760	1063760	You'll never get rid of me.
1063760	1065760	I'm not going anywhere.
1065760	1068760	I'm going to be right here.
1068760	1073760	Right in the corner of your eye for the rest of your life.
1073760	1075760	Mocking you.
1075760	1079760	Rob, in 180 episodes, I want to see your tuxedo.
1079760	1080760	Oh, yeah.
1080760	1081760	I got one.
1081760	1082760	I got a couple.
1082760	1084760	I got one furry charm.
1087760	1088760	Come on.
1088760	1089760	Dan.
1089760	1090760	Dan.
1090760	1095760	Dan, I want to apologize to you because in the weeks that I've been away, your shows have
1095760	1096760	been excellent.
1096760	1097760	Oh, thank you.
1097760	1101760	Norman fucking Lear was on this show.
1101760	1106760	And God, I wanted to be here just to wrangle.
1106760	1111760	I felt like, oh, my job, if I was there, would be to wrangle Shropp.
1111760	1112760	Right.
1112760	1114760	It would be to, yeah, I would have to wrangle it.
1114760	1116760	But I was not a little out of line for that one.
1116760	1117760	No, I was so nice.
1117760	1118760	I feel like.
1118760	1120760	I was so nice in that one.
1120760	1121760	What are you talking about?
1121760	1122760	I was so nice.
1122760	1128760	I feel like I, there was a couple times when I was yelling at my radio, I was like, Shropp,
1128760	1131760	Shropp, Shropp, Shropp, Shropp.
1131760	1134760	And I was making a hand gesture.
1134760	1135760	Oh, yeah.
1135760	1136760	Well, yeah.
1136760	1139760	Will you listen to Good Rob?
1140760	1143760	Thank you.
1143760	1145760	Never.
1145760	1147760	Hey, Dan, ask Rob a question.
1147760	1149760	Like, just talk to Rob for a second.
1149760	1150760	Yeah, ask me how my week was.
1150760	1152760	Ask Rob how his week was.
1152760	1153760	Shropp?
1153760	1155760	Yeah, just ask him how his week was.
1155760	1157760	I'm doing a little comptrolling experiment over here.
1157760	1164760	It's like asking Donald Trump if I'm a loser.
1164760	1166760	I don't know.
1166760	1170760	I don't know if he had anything to say about himself or whatever.
1170760	1172760	Shropp, how was your day?
1172760	1173760	It was pretty good.
1173760	1175760	I was working at the office.
1175760	1181760	And, you know, I think I overdid it with a Red Bull.
1181760	1189760	My tongue is feeling very sensitive right now.
1189760	1194760	And then, yeah, that was pretty much it for today.
1194760	1195760	All right.
1195760	1197760	I slept in these clothes.
1197760	1200760	200 episodes!
1204760	1208760	I think Jeff's just trying to prove something about the camera.
1208760	1213760	Spencer was the only one on that shot the entire time.
1213760	1215760	Yeah.
1215760	1217760	I'm not here.
1217760	1219760	I feel like I'm being back comptrolled right now.
1219760	1225760	I think you're trying to sneak attack, undermine my comptrolling authorities.
1228760	1230760	You did not!
1230760	1232760	You did not!
1232760	1237760	I come out stage left every show and in our 200 episode you had to come out stage right
1237760	1240760	and sit down at the opposite side of the stage as me.
1240760	1243760	And I feel like I know exactly what you're doing.
1243760	1244760	Okay.
1244760	1246760	I think this is real.
1247760	1248760	All right.
1248760	1249760	Well, okay.
1249760	1253760	If it's a simulation.
1253760	1255760	So I want to know.
1255760	1260760	I know that I asked the question, you know, are people watching me jerk off?
1260760	1262760	Is anyone watching me jerk off?
1266760	1268760	Yes.
1268760	1273760	Those people you pay every morning when they come over to your house.
1273760	1275760	And I asked Cody that.
1275760	1279760	She said, why would they watch you when I'm in there?
1279760	1281760	They're watching me.
1281760	1285760	But I don't think they would be watching me for pleasure or even for just like, oh, look,
1285760	1286760	he's drinking off.
1286760	1291760	But I feel like they might be watching me for like kind of like just look how dishonest
1291760	1292760	he is.
1292760	1295760	Look how much he really thinks no one's watching.
1295760	1301760	You think maybe like in this simulation that whoever's watching us, you might be like a
1301760	1302760	one bit.
1302760	1308760	They're like, this is a special like a like a where our usually pointed at this dude because
1308760	1311760	he exhibits a lot of very fascinating behavior.
1311760	1312760	Yeah.
1312760	1314760	Like I'm Michael Scott of the of the simulator.
1314760	1315760	Yeah.
1315760	1316760	Dunder Mifflin.
1316760	1317760	All right.
1317760	1318760	I'll buy that.
1318760	1319760	Yeah.
1319760	1320760	I could be.
1320760	1321760	I mean, you know, I don't think I'm worth it.
1321760	1322760	I just think it would be making fun of me.
1322760	1323760	But what do you guys.
1323760	1324760	Okay.
1324760	1325760	Well, okay.
1325760	1326760	So I believe all this, by the way.
1326760	1329760	So by the way, since it's our 200th episode.
1329760	1331760	I heard you, Rob.
1331760	1333760	Thanks, man.
1333760	1334760	Go ahead.
1334760	1340600	And I guess I guess maybe if you well, I don't know, you know, if hashtag any questions
1340600	1348240	or questions that you have for Harmon Town and it's 200th episode tweet tweet Jeff at
1348240	1350240	Jeff Brian Davis was Jeff.
1350240	1351240	Does that your Twitter?
1351240	1352240	Jeff Brian.
1352240	1353240	David Brian with a Y.
1353240	1354240	Okay.
1354240	1362040	Brian with a Y and maybe hashtag it snuggle, but I don't know, you don't have to hashtag
1362040	1363040	it anything.
1363040	1364040	Yeah.
1364040	1368560	I mean, well, I thought maybe some short hashtag hashtag hot cues.
1368560	1369560	Hot cues.
1369560	1370560	Hot questions.
1370560	1371560	Yeah.
1371560	1372560	That's her for hot questions.
1372560	1373560	Okay.
1373560	1374560	Hot cue.
1374560	1375560	Hot cue.
1375560	1376560	Hashtag hot cues.
1376560	1381120	Jeff can aggregate your questions if there's any good ones and things start to slow down
1381120	1383120	at any point on this episode.
1383120	1392440	Hey, I'd like to open that up for anybody who wants to hashtag me too, just to help
1392440	1396240	out with the show.
1396240	1398680	You can hashtag me if you want.
1398680	1399840	Hashtag me.
1399840	1405080	It's like the show has just become about how I hate him.
1405080	1406080	Yeah.
1406080	1410760	It's like he's trying to line in the sand with his hole next to Spencer.
1410760	1413760	So far, all I'm getting is a lot of new followers.
1413760	1417440	It's better than my Teen Wolf people.
1417440	1422280	Apparently, Teen Wolf is going to the season five, you guys.
1422280	1423280	We did it.
1423280	1424280	Do you know who I am?
1424280	1425280	Who?
1425280	1428240	Do you know about Teen Wolf and my thing with Teen Wolf?
1428240	1433240	The guy that created, not the movie, the TV show on MTV that I've never seen, the guy
1433240	1434800	that created it is named Jeff Davis.
1434800	1440400	So a good percentage of my followers love and hate me because of this TV show.
1440400	1444560	So I'm frequently fielding sex commands and death threats.
1444560	1445560	Horrible.
1445560	1446560	Okay.
1446560	1447560	Well, you know what?
1447560	1448560	I mean, fuck you.
1448560	1453640	Who would win in a fight, Dan, between Rob Shrob and Rod Cordry?
1453640	1454640	Hashtag hot cues.
1454640	1457800	It's not a good question.
1457800	1460400	It's not going to help the show at all.
1460400	1461800	Okay.
1461800	1463160	Maybe Spencer should take that question.
1463160	1464640	That's more of a Spencer- I don't know.
1465640	1466640	Spencer, go ahead.
1467640	1469640	Cordry definitely looks bulkier right now.
1469640	1470640	Why?
1470640	1471640	Look at you, man.
1471640	1472640	You got muscles.
1472640	1474640	I'm wearing a white t-shirt right now.
1474640	1477640	He doesn't look like he's eaten right in weeks, you know?
1477640	1479640	I hear he's a vegetarian now.
1479640	1480640	No.
1480640	1481640	Just come on.
1481640	1482640	Yeah.
1482640	1483640	You're from Boston?
1483640	1484640	I don't know.
1484640	1485640	I'm from Boston.
1485640	1486640	Yeah.
1486640	1487640	I do have bad heads.
1487640	1488640	Yeah.
1488640	1489640	All he eats is-
1489640	1490640	I've been punching the face a lot.
1490640	1493640	And smaller Bostonians.
1493640	1496640	That is all he eats.
1496640	1497640	Listen to it later.
1497640	1500640	We'll try to pull- dig out my audio.
1500640	1504640	I saw him out in the store front tonight.
1504640	1506640	And it's our 200th episode.
1506640	1508640	And he's been a big part of our mythology.
1508640	1509640	He's come.
1509640	1510640	He's gone.
1510640	1511640	He's been around.
1511640	1514640	He's like, I mean, I don't know if it's going to pick things up, give us a new scapegoat,
1514640	1519640	to just drive things all the way into the ditch and bury us with our own shovel.
1519640	1522640	But if Adam Goldberg wanted to come up and pay a visit-
1522640	1523640	Yeah.
1523640	1525640	Oh, no.
1532640	1534640	He's exactly as I pictured him.
1540640	1541640	All right.
1541640	1542640	Sorry Twitter hashtag.
1542640	1544640	This might have to go on hold for a while.
1546640	1549640	Time for the hot cues to meet the hot A. Adam.
1549640	1550640	Adam Goldberg.
1553640	1556640	That one's been cooking for a while.
1558640	1560640	That was perfect.
1561640	1563640	That is the perfect delivery.
1566640	1568640	Time for the hot cues.
1568640	1575640	The timid, the barrel breach, kind of like got some gunpowder in your eyes.
1575640	1576640	I don't even know.
1576640	1578640	You've got to look to the side as you shot it.
1578640	1581640	I know this show has changed because people are like, I miss you.
1581640	1584640	So you guys have to have done some.
1584640	1585640	Well, I'm back, y'all.
1585640	1588640	Yeah, we've had some bad episodes.
1588640	1589640	Yeah.
1590640	1591640	How you been, Adam?
1591640	1593640	Good, good, good, and pretty good.
1593640	1594640	Good, good, and pretty good.
1594640	1595640	Yeah.
1595640	1596640	Kind of trailed off towards the end there.
1596640	1598640	Well, not that good.
1598640	1599640	Yeah.
1599640	1601640	But good, good, good, good, not five goods.
1601640	1603640	How's your spine?
1603640	1604640	That sounds rude.
1604640	1605640	No.
1605640	1606640	But you have a-
1606640	1607640	It's fine.
1607640	1609640	I finally stopped being on terrible reality show.
1609640	1610640	Wait, no, that's not true.
1610640	1614640	I'm actually producing a movie in Ireland, which is the-
1614640	1615640	Yes.
1617640	1621640	The subject of the film is currently not able to talk about script development
1621640	1627640	because her car was destroyed by an ex-boyfriend who blew it up due to IRA nonsense.
1627640	1628640	So that's my life.
1629640	1630640	That's my life.
1630640	1633640	So in your short time in Ireland, you've actually-
1633640	1635640	Oh, I'm not going over there yet until that gets settled.
1635640	1637640	I thought you reignited it by going over there.
1637640	1638640	I thought you somehow-
1640640	1641640	I was like, really?
1641640	1642640	I thought that was over.
1642640	1646640	That's why they kicked us out in 950 because it's like, if Goldberg's coming from this,
1646640	1648640	it's like, we'd rather have the snakes.
1654640	1657640	Adam, what do you think happens after we die?
1657640	1658640	Oh, man.
1658640	1660640	I guess we reboot.
1660640	1664640	I don't worry about what happens after we die because I know there was a lovely time
1664640	1669640	in Earth's history before I was alive, and I figure we're just going to the other side of it.
1670640	1673640	I don't think we're in a Matrix inside of a Matrix inside of a Matrix
1673640	1678640	because that just took a really good movie and ended up with Morpheus stabbing people
1678640	1681640	with a katana on top of an oil tanker.
1682640	1686640	Well, that's just, I mean, but we might be able to make good Matrix movies in 10 years.
1687640	1688640	It's time for a reboot.
1688640	1691640	There's so many unanswered questions from the first Matrix.
1691640	1695640	If we're in a simulation, do you think people starting to say,
1695640	1703640	I think we're in a simulation, is A, the goal of the simulation, B, a corruption of the simulation
1703640	1709640	that will have to be terminated with immediate whatever the opposite of the big bang is, a big suck?
1710640	1716640	I mean, do you think that it has anything to do with the concept of a simulation, or is it just a byproduct?
1716640	1719640	If the simulation didn't want people to know it was a simulation,
1719640	1722640	René Descartes would have said, I think, therefore, I exist,
1722640	1725640	and then died of a nosebleed seconds later.
1725640	1726640	Why?
1726640	1730640	Because he thought, oh, the only thing I can know about myself is that I exist
1730640	1733640	because someone has to be able to say I exist.
1733640	1737640	And then he got into the idea of this weird malevolent ghost and therefore God exists.
1737640	1739640	But he was doing pretty good for the time.
1740640	1742640	And then they kicked the Jews out of France.
1743640	1744640	That was him?
1744640	1747640	No, it wasn't not him.
1750640	1751640	I think, therefore, I'm Christian.
1751640	1752640	Careful.
1752640	1753640	Careful.
1753640	1756640	What? Are they going to kick us out of nerd belt, too?
1760640	1762640	Is there a Jean Paul Sartre in the house?
1766640	1767640	Adam Goldberg.
1767640	1768640	Dan, what color are your nipples?
1768640	1770640	Ask somebody here on Hot Cues.
1771640	1772640	Dan, they still have a great question.
1772640	1773640	Let me answer that.
1773640	1774640	That's a great question.
1775640	1776640	Normal.
1777640	1778640	Beige?
1779640	1780640	I would call that pink.
1780640	1781640	What about that right there?
1781640	1782640	I would call that pink.
1782640	1785640	Those are lines from the weight of my tits.
1785640	1786640	It's not a line.
1786640	1789640	It's a glistening line of sweat in it.
1789640	1790640	It does have some sweat in it.
1790640	1791640	It's a boot sweat.
1795640	1796640	Yeah, I do.
1796640	1797640	Let me look.
1797640	1798640	Let me look.
1798640	1799640	Let me look.
1799640	1804640	Okay, Spencer, on our side, we're getting a lot of beige with like a dark red beige
1804640	1805640	element to it.
1805640	1807640	Spencer, what color are they from your lighting system?
1807640	1810640	I'd say they're like a dark beige with like a dark red beige element.
1810640	1811640	See?
1811640	1812640	They're just like...
1813640	1814640	The normal red red?
1814640	1815640	The normal looking nipples.
1817640	1818640	Yeah, well...
1818640	1820640	I'm just really sorry about the whole sweat thing.
1820640	1821640	No, it's...
1821640	1822640	I mean...
1822640	1823640	I feel terrible about that.
1823640	1824640	No, it's...
1824640	1825640	I really...
1825640	1827640	I saw a line of sweat and I laughed and I...
1827640	1831640	But I'm using it as an opportunity to send a message to the young people that they don't
1831640	1832640	have to be bodyshamed.
1832640	1833640	Yeah.
1833640	1836640	It doesn't matter, wherever you sweat, you sweat and I'm sorry.
1836640	1839640	You say body sweat or bodyslam?
1839640	1843640	I'm gonna do an Instagram photo of me with my sweaty titties.
1843640	1844640	I was thinking about you being on boots with buffoons yesterday.
1844640	1847640	Dressed as Jareth and I thought I heard the word bodyslam.
1847640	1848640	I was just trying to...
1849640	1851640	Dan, what's with your underwear?
1851640	1852640	What's with your underwear?
1852640	1854640	What's with your hand regular underwear?
1854640	1855640	Show us your underwear, bro.
1855640	1856640	Hashtag hot cues.
1856640	1857640	Turn around.
1857640	1858640	Turn around with your...
1858640	1859640	Look at this.
1860640	1861640	Did you just...
1862640	1863640	Did you just...
1865640	1866640	Those are great underwears.
1866640	1868640	Did you escape from the lower half of a prison?
1868640	1870640	Hey Adam, why did you leave for a hundred episodes?
1871640	1872640	I don't think...
1872640	1877640	I don't think this is the sponsorship that they had hoped for, but those are my me undies
1877640	1878640	I'm trying out.
1878640	1879640	Those are definitely me undies.
1879640	1881640	I hear they're the most comfortable undies in the world.
1881640	1884640	They are very comfortable, but I don't think I'm doing them any favors.
1885640	1891640	Do you want your distended lower gut to be summonable like Beetlejuice?
1892640	1897640	Say me undies three times and watch the sparks fly.
1897640	1899640	No, they're quite comfortable.
1899640	1901640	It's almost like cheating.
1901640	1902640	I think we...
1902640	1905640	Dino always said that civilization peaked at dessert because we were like,
1905640	1909640	okay, so I'm eating and I'm not hungry and it's helping kill me.
1910640	1914640	We definitely was all downhill from there, but I think...
1915640	1920640	I guess that still sounds like it'll hold true, but a good other candidate for the peak would be
1920640	1924640	men's undies starting to get real, real panty-like.
1924640	1925640	Real technical.
1925640	1926640	Real satiny.
1926640	1927640	Yeah.
1927640	1930640	Because now it's just like, well, what about me?
1930640	1935640	How come I can't feel like a soft little kitten when I'm working?
1936640	1939640	At work the other day, I had to wear a dress.
1940640	1941640	Congrats.
1941640	1942640	That's my job.
1942640	1943640	Sometimes.
1944640	1946640	But it was a real hugger.
1947640	1955640	And there was five different pairs of underwear hanging in my trailer to try on with the dress.
1955640	1960640	You know, to not show lines, to lift and separate your balls.
1960640	1963640	My huge, huge, huge...
1964640	1970640	And I tried on all of them because I don't know anything about men's underwear
1970640	1972640	and there's a whole world out there.
1972640	1973640	Yeah.
1973640	1975640	There's a whole wonderful world out there.
1975640	1977640	It's not just like pieces of fabric shaped like...
1977640	1981640	I got to tell you, all the five brands I tried were fantastic.
1981640	1982640	Yeah.
1982640	1985640	Was one of them Andrew Christian, something like that?
1985640	1990640	Because my ex-girlfriend, we were on Palm Springs and my ex-girlfriend Kate.
1990640	1994640	I didn't have a bathing suit and we asked around, like, what's a good place to get a bathing suit?
1994640	1995640	A bathing suit.
1995640	1996640	A bathing suit.
1996640	1998640	Dr. Freud, a patient for you?
1998640	2003640	The place is called Game Art, America's favorite gay superstar.
2003640	2010640	And they have awesome bathing suits in there, but they also have the most absolutely compendious...
2010640	2015640	There's aisle after aisle, row after row of complicated men's underwear.
2015640	2016640	And guess what?
2016640	2017640	They feel good.
2017640	2018640	They feel great.
2018640	2019640	They feel fantastic.
2019640	2021640	What are you rocking right now?
2021640	2022640	I think...
2022640	2026640	I'm just wearing kind of boring Calvin Klein boxer briefs right now.
2026640	2027640	Laundry day tomorrow?
2027640	2029640	I'm traveling tomorrow, so all the good ones are in the bag.
2029640	2030640	I hear you.
2030640	2034640	How about you, Adam Goldberg?
2034640	2036640	I just...
2036640	2040640	Boxer briefs seem too tight, but I've never been like, oh, my underwear is uncomfortable.
2040640	2047640	Not since, like, I've moved up from the tighty-whities around age nine to be like, well, this is really holding me back.
2047640	2048640	I feel if I bought...
2048640	2054640	I feel if I bought one pair of Meondi's, I'd lower the enjoyment I get of all my non-Meondi underwear.
2054640	2058640	That's the goal of nice underwear, people, is to try to ruin you on your faves.
2058640	2060640	It's the base hedonism level of underwear.
2060640	2061640	But also, you've got to think about...
2061640	2065640	Because I want to be on a long flight to London tomorrow, and you've got to think about,
2065640	2069640	I can't wear the snug, sexy ones, because that's going to be too snug and sexy for a long flight.
2069640	2073640	But you can't wear the kind of bloomery boxers ones, because those will...
2073640	2074640	Yeah, those are...
2074640	2075640	The right up on England.
2075640	2076640	Oh, they're terrible.
2076640	2077640	Yeah.
2077640	2078640	Terrible.
2078640	2079640	Cotton, cotton bunchy.
2079640	2080640	Cotton, oh.
2080640	2081640	Like, Haynes, forget it.
2081640	2082640	You're fucked.
2082640	2083640	You're fucked.
2083640	2084640	Fuck you, Haynes.
2084640	2087640	Hashtag, fuck you, Haynes.
2087640	2089640	Hit me with a Twitter question.
2089640	2090640	All right.
2090640	2091640	Better be a good one.
2091640	2092640	Hot cues.
2092640	2093640	All right.
2093640	2095640	Well, I haven't been looking through, because we...
2095640	2097640	Well, I got a hot cue for you, Jeff.
2097640	2098640	Adam...
2098640	2099640	Oh, sorry.
2099640	2100640	Sorry.
2100640	2101640	I wasn't yelling at you.
2101640	2102640	Adam?
2102640	2103640	I'm surprised you weren't.
2103640	2104640	Well, sorry.
2104640	2105640	I have one if you want it.
2105640	2106640	All right.
2106640	2107640	Are you starting with the Adam question?
2107640	2108640	No, no, no.
2108640	2109640	I'll go to Adam next.
2109640	2110640	Okay.
2110640	2111640	This is fucking...
2111640	2112640	Now we're cooking.
2112640	2113640	Yeah.
2113640	2114640	This is a great show.
2114640	2115640	This is a great show.
2115640	2116640	10 minutes of...
2116640	2117640	You can ask a question, Rob.
2117640	2118640	You don't have to tweet at Jeff to ask a question.
2118640	2119640	Jeff, will you...
2119640	2120640	Well, okay.
2120640	2123760	I was going to ask another question, but someone just said right now, Scott Sweeney asks, Jeff
2123760	2129640	Brian Davis, Dan, will you make the Ruffalo kissy face, hashtag Ruffalo soldier, hashtag
2129640	2130640	hot cues?
2130640	2134160	What's the Ruffalo kissy face?
2134160	2135160	What's the secret is he's...
2135160	2136160	Okay.
2136160	2137160	I think.
2137160	2147880	I've never done it in a mirror, but...
2147880	2148880	That's exactly it.
2148880	2149880	That's the spotlight seduction.
2149880	2157240	You know, he's fucking so interested in all the pedophilia, but not interested in it.
2157240	2158240	He's interested in exposing it.
2158240	2159240	So curious about how this can happen.
2159240	2162240	I have a question for Chris backstage.
2162320	2164320	I have a question for Chris backstage.
2164320	2165320	I'm assuming.
2165320	2166320	Was Chris...
2166320	2167320	No.
2167320	2168320	Who makes the banners?
2168320	2169320	All right.
2169320	2170720	Someone asked, where did the hot cues banner go?
2170720	2171720	Apparently there's a hot...
2171720	2172720	There's a little banner underneath.
2172720	2173720	I didn't know we had that technology.
2173720	2174720	That's awesome.
2174720	2175720	Oh, yeah.
2175720	2176720	I mean, we really...
2176720	2177720	Hot cues, man.
2177720	2178720	It's really taken off, guys.
2178720	2179720	It's a meme.
2179720	2180720	So then we can...
2180720	2181720	With a show, we'll explode outward.
2181720	2182720	We can show people's tweets and answer them.
2182720	2183720	I could say, look at this.
2183720	2185360	I took a picture of my dog today.
2185360	2188360	It'll be great.
2188360	2191000	Goldberg, did you...
2191000	2195520	Did I hear a rumor that you had some kind of quiz?
2195520	2196800	I had a quiz.
2196800	2199000	I think this is...
2199000	2202520	If we have any super fans in the audience...
2202520	2203520	All right.
2203520	2204520	Yeah.
2204520	2205520	Cordry's a super fan.
2205520	2207960	Cordry raises his hand for the people.
2207960	2208960	I don't know.
2208960	2209960	Did we ever tell the...
2209960	2213040	Now I can't remember if we told the story because I've asked you if we told the story.
2213040	2215040	We never have.
2215040	2220240	Your wife and kids and you, but you were like working most of the time in baller country,
2220480	2224800	your wife and kids and therefore sometimes you were living next door to me without knowing
2224800	2225800	you.
2225800	2226800	Next door to you.
2226800	2227800	Yeah.
2227800	2229760	And at one point, you were trying to get on Wi-Fi...
2229760	2233720	At an Airbnb, which there were French rapper...
2233720	2240280	You referenced French rappers living next to you at an Airbnb in one episode.
2240280	2244400	So I was at this Airbnb, and it was right near my house because we lived very close
2244400	2249240	to each other, and I was trying to get the Wi-Fi, and I didn't get it from my wife, and
2249240	2250240	I looked...
2250240	2251240	It said...
2251240	2252240	My Wi-Fi.
2252240	2253240	Harmon Wi-Fi.
2253240	2254240	I was like...
2254240	2255240	Yeah.
2255240	2260240	I gotta change my password for Dan.
2260240	2265040	I was gonna text to you and say, what's your password for your Wi-Fi?
2265040	2266040	But...
2266040	2267040	It's not a good story.
2267040	2268040	Yeah.
2268040	2269040	All right.
2269040	2270040	That's a great story.
2270040	2271040	I thought it was very interesting.
2271040	2272040	Oh, I know.
2272040	2273040	The best part of the story is...
2273040	2274040	Do you remember the episode...
2274040	2275440	This is a great 200th episode, by the way.
2275840	2281040	Do you remember the episode where you got your neighbors up here to talk about the trees?
2281040	2282040	That was a good episode.
2285040	2288040	Get ready to shit your pants.
2288040	2289840	What kind of trees were they?
2289840	2290840	What countries?
2290840	2293840	Kind of trees, man.
2293840	2294840	Shit.
2296840	2297840	Eucalyptus.
2297840	2298840	What countries were they?
2298840	2299840	Eucalyptus trees.
2299840	2302440	There was this whole thing.
2303440	2312440	It's my favorite episode, where you read your tweets with your neighbor on this stage...
2312440	2313440	Oh, that was the best.
2313440	2316440	...with the eucalyptus trees.
2316440	2326440	When I saw Harmon Wi-Fi, I looked out the front window and there's one eucalyptus tree,
2326440	2332440	splitting the yard between my Airbnb and Dan's, what I know now, Dan's front yard.
2332440	2335440	I was like, that's the fucking tree that Dan won't cut down.
2335440	2339440	That I won't even have looked at, and the neighbors are asking questions.
2339440	2342440	That you've forgotten about since that episode.
2342440	2343440	Yes, I have.
2343440	2347440	Well, they're very important trees, and it's rotting, and you should take care of it.
2347440	2353440	I also have an embroidered, cross-stitched thing that's a fan-made that's framed that
2353440	2357440	I wanted to give to Beth, because it's an embroidered kind of like plaque, you know,
2357440	2359440	like, bless this mess-style kind of thing.
2359440	2364440	But it says, in a weird way, Beth, that tree can totally suck my human dick.
2366440	2370440	And it's like very, very nicely done, and I was going to give it to her to hang on her wall.
2372440	2376440	I don't know why those two, why she wasn't like a regular on this show.
2376440	2378440	You should have had her back every week.
2378440	2381440	Yeah, I guess maybe because she's so nice.
2382440	2383440	That's healthy.
2383440	2389440	Maybe people aren't as interesting after their first appearance, even if they come back literally dozens of times.
2389440	2390440	Yeah.
2390440	2391440	Hey, man.
2391440	2393440	I don't know what you're talking about.
2393440	2394440	Hey.
2394440	2395440	I'm sure that's a phenomenon.
2395440	2397440	Fuck you, Goldberg.
2399440	2401440	That's a milestone for guests.
2401440	2405440	I thought he was trying to find a loophole to forgive himself.
2405440	2407440	I was trying to get a laugh.
2407440	2408440	Yeah.
2408440	2413440	Goldberg, I've got some cues, but I don't want to get too jazzed about winning, you know?
2413440	2415440	So if you get it right, that's cool.
2415440	2416440	And if you don't...
2416440	2417440	It doesn't matter.
2417440	2418440	It doesn't matter.
2418440	2419440	We're having fun, right?
2419440	2420440	We're not having fun.
2420440	2421440	We're not having fun.
2421440	2422440	There's an exit there and an exit there.
2422440	2424440	I think people thought this was a quiz.
2424440	2426440	It's just a little fun.
2426440	2427440	We're just having fun.
2427440	2428440	It's the episode...
2428440	2430440	A lot of people on Twitter are calling this a hot quiz, too.
2430440	2431440	Hot quiz.
2431440	2432440	Hot quiz.
2432440	2435440	Also, there's been hot jizz, hot snizz, there's been all sorts of shit.
2435440	2438440	Also, a lot of stuff is quite mean and quite friendly.
2438440	2441440	And also, I want to punch up so many of their jokes.
2442440	2443440	Yeah, you're really a hot wiz.
2443440	2446440	A lot of people are like, I would have read that one if you just switched those two words
2446440	2447440	around.
2447440	2449440	So close.
2449440	2451440	Rob, this is probably the best question.
2451440	2452440	Go ahead.
2452440	2456440	Jeff predicted that there would be an episode 200 trivia question.
2456440	2458440	For two points, what was the question?
2458440	2459440	Jesus.
2459440	2463440	Or for one point, I can say, I'll give you the question, you give me the answer.
2464440	2465440	Oh, man.
2465440	2466440	Oh, man.
2466440	2467440	Well, I don't know the...
2467440	2468440	I don't know the question.
2468440	2469440	Anyone up here know the question?
2469440	2470440	Read it again for me.
2470440	2471440	Okay.
2471440	2475440	So on episode 100, you said that's going to be on the episode 200 quiz.
2475440	2476440	These are really surging.
2476440	2478440	We have a hand waving out there.
2478440	2479440	Yeah, Dave.
2480440	2481440	Uh, yep.
2481440	2482440	What?
2482440	2483440	Dan likes Pippin, the musical?
2483440	2484440	Okay.
2484440	2485440	Pippin.
2485440	2490440	Dippin is the answer to the question, which was Dan's favorite desert island foot sex move.
2490440	2491440	Okay.
2492440	2494440	My favorite shoe play.
2495440	2496440	What's Dippin?
2496440	2498440	If I had to choose between Dippin, Dippin, and Pippin.
2498440	2499440	Is that Dippin and Pippin?
2499440	2500440	Yeah.
2500440	2501440	Yeah, Pippin.
2501440	2502440	I would choose Dippin.
2502440	2503440	Has the foot fetish movement evolved?
2503440	2504440	There's still the core...
2504440	2505440	Yeah, what's going on with that?
2505440	2506440	There's something going on.
2506440	2507440	How's that evolved?
2507440	2508440	What's going on?
2508440	2509440	Yeah.
2509440	2510440	What's doing with your foot thing?
2510440	2512440	Have the pantyhose challenges gotten harder?
2512440	2513440	Hey.
2513440	2514440	Hey, yeah.
2514440	2515440	Hey.
2515440	2516440	What's up with that foot thing?
2516440	2517440	This is good.
2517440	2518440	Hey, come on, man.
2518440	2519440	Hey.
2519440	2521440	Tell us a little bit more about that foot thing.
2521440	2522440	Yeah.
2522440	2523440	I'd catch us up.
2523440	2524440	Come on.
2524440	2528580	I'd love to share as much as I can, but it kind of impedes on the privacy of my beautiful
2528580	2529580	footy girlfriend.
2529580	2530580	Well, somebody else, Dan, if I may interrupt...
2530580	2531580	Call her Miss X.
2531580	2532580	Somebody tweeted.
2532580	2536720	It was way back down the list, and I don't know who the name of the person that tweeted
2536720	2539280	asked, will Cody ever be up on the stage and in the show?
2539280	2546880	Well, she's not one for the spotlight, I mean, as easy on the eyes as she is.
2546880	2547880	Congrats.
2547880	2548880	Lovely.
2548880	2553240	But she herself, the human soul that she is, is not like a performer.
2553240	2554240	She's a mere.
2554240	2556840	She gave up her voice so she could walk on land with humans.
2556840	2559080	Told it to a sea witch.
2559080	2560080	Heard it every time.
2560080	2561080	She put it in her words.
2561080	2567440	She gave up her voice to walk on the land with humans.
2567440	2572080	To put it in her words, she loves attention as much as anybody, but she likes unconditional
2572080	2573080	attention.
2573080	2576320	As soon as it starts to get conditional, she doesn't have the stomach for it.
2576320	2577320	I don't understand that.
2577320	2578320	Yeah, I'm the same.
2578760	2581160	Well, yeah, there's some of us that are like, fuck, what?
2581160	2584320	Some people are gonna fucking hate my guts and tell me to kill myself with fire?
2584320	2585320	Totally conditional with me.
2585320	2588420	Now, you know, in for a penny.
2588420	2589420	Just need that attention.
2589420	2590420	Having that fire yet.
2590420	2594240	And then other people are like, yeah, I'll take it if it doesn't cost me anything.
2594240	2595520	And she's one of the latter.
2595520	2596520	So, you know.
2596520	2597520	So, no?
2597520	2602000	Well, no, I'm not gonna make that choice for her, and I don't think she's given to, she's
2602000	2603880	not gonna go like, I should come up on stage.
2603880	2605600	She's not like, she's not that tight.
2605600	2606600	Masochist.
2606600	2607600	There you go.
2607600	2608600	And the...
2608600	2611640	Where are you from in Boston?
2611640	2615480	And if I said, Cody, do you want to come up on stage, she'd be put under pressure, and
2615480	2617600	then if she came up, we wouldn't even know if she wanted to.
2617600	2621760	No, if she wanted to come up, she'd be right there in the window, and she's not so cool.
2621760	2622760	Okay, great.
2622760	2628360	Yeah, and somebody asked Cody, do you do your thing?
2628360	2630720	Don't worry about it.
2630720	2631720	We got it.
2631720	2632720	Go ahead.
2632720	2633720	Somebody asked...
2633720	2634720	This is a good question.
2634720	2635720	I like this one.
2636160	2646160	Keremi Hibis asks, hot cues, has Dan put anything in his butt since the first episode of Harman
2646160	2647160	Challenge?
2647160	2648160	That's a good question.
2648160	2649160	That's a good cue.
2649160	2652600	Not really since the Sharpie that I put in my butt, really.
2652600	2654440	That wasn't even during Harman Challenge, right?
2654440	2656120	That was a story that happened before Harman Challenge.
2656120	2657120	That was the last thing I put in my butt, I think.
2657120	2660720	Yeah, we all put something in our butt a long time ago that we were just...
2660720	2661720	That we don't do anymore.
2661720	2664560	Given that a world, we don't do it anymore because...
2664560	2665560	And for some of you...
2666200	2668400	You put something up your butt and you were like, this is great.
2668400	2669400	Is that a great or not great?
2669400	2672200	It took me this long to start doing this and you put more stuff up your butt and you are
2672200	2673200	good people too.
2673200	2677940	Yeah, you know that Great Proops' podcast, Smartest Man in the World, one of his sponsors
2677940	2678940	is MeUndies.
2678940	2681720	He's like, we're not getting a nickel for this and Great Proops is getting all that.
2681720	2685240	Yeah, he's getting those sweet 35 cents per click.
2685240	2690680	And those MeUndies, man, when you put them on, it feels like a second skin.
2690680	2697120	It feels like a delicious manta ray wrapped around your balls.
2697120	2698760	Save it for the actual sponsorship, man.
2698760	2699760	Oh, sorry.
2699760	2702440	I got a sizzling cue for you, Jeff.
2702440	2704080	Give me a hot cue, Adam Goldberg.
2704080	2707720	How did you get associated with Lucha Vavoom?
2707720	2708720	Did they contact you?
2708720	2710960	And do you have any great stories about Lucha Doors?
2710960	2712960	I have a lot of great...
2712960	2715680	Lucha Vavoom is one of the coolest things I ever got involved in.
2715680	2719920	I just have mutual friends and they blank a patch as a buddy of ours.
2720680	2724800	It's a hilarious comedian blank a patch and he and people like Dana Gold and some other
2724800	2727160	friends of ours would rotate through with him.
2727160	2731800	And I just managed somehow to kind of be like the secondary host a lot in that show.
2731800	2737040	But when my friends come to the show, what the show is, if you don't know it, it's straight
2737040	2738040	as part of Full House.
2738040	2739040	It's Full House.
2739040	2742040	It's like Lucha Libre.
2742040	2747360	Like Lucha Doors and then Burlesque Driptease and comedy and stuff like that.
2747360	2748360	It's very wild.
2748480	2753000	Two shows ago, sitting right to our left was Morrissey and he looked like Morrissey.
2753000	2757280	He looked bummed out the whole time because you don't really think of Morrissey as a fun
2757280	2758280	time fella.
2758280	2759280	He's a creep.
2759280	2760280	So he's a weirdo.
2760280	2761280	But he looks great.
2761280	2763880	He looks like Morrissey, but a little bit older, but he still looks groovy.
2763880	2766920	And then when the first mini comes out, the first little person, because some of the wrestlers
2766920	2771760	are little and some are quite big, as soon as the minis came out, he was the happiest
2771760	2774760	guy in town.
2775760	2779280	Blaine and I kept sneaking over and taking selfies with ourself and Morrissey, and Morrissey's
2779280	2780280	like,
2780280	2782280	That's all he needed.
2782280	2785400	All of Morrissey's cred was out the door.
2785400	2787400	That's all he's been waiting for.
2787400	2791480	I haven't had a dream in a long, oh, midgets.
2796480	2797480	It was great.
2797480	2798480	We couldn't get over it.
2798480	2803240	And then Blaine and I are like, frequently when famous people come, we will say, oh,
2803240	2804240	so and so is here.
2804240	2808480	You do that Vegas thing where you say that, oh, we got, you know, the guy from this band
2808480	2811120	that you love and the woman that directed the movie that you love.
2811120	2815240	And we're like, the woman that drank in the movie that directed the movie, get the shit
2815240	2816240	out of your ears.
2816240	2822720	And I would say, don't ever interrupt, but it's that's what you do.
2822720	2823720	The horse is out of the gate.
2823720	2830240	No, I have a completely lost right away.
2830240	2831240	Two hundred episodes.
2832240	2834240	And I don't even know where that fucking was.
2834240	2835240	You dressed as Jared.
2835240	2836240	Oh, yeah.
2836240	2838240	So Blaine and I were like, do we do it?
2838240	2840240	Do we get in towards the end of the show?
2840240	2842240	Like, do we do we rumble Morrissey?
2842240	2847240	And do we say like, everybody Morrissey because the crowd would freak out because I don't
2847240	2848240	know if you know this.
2848240	2851240	A lot of Morrissey's fan base is very Latino, especially in Los Angeles.
2851240	2852240	Oh, yeah.
2852240	2855240	A friend of mine in the bar was asked somebody like, you're not Mexican bro.
2855240	2858240	And he goes, dude, I got five Morrissey shirts.
2859240	2861240	That's a real conversation that actually happens.
2861240	2862240	It's true.
2862240	2863240	Yeah.
2863240	2864240	It really is a thing.
2864240	2865240	Fair enough.
2865240	2867240	It's one of the most delightful stereotypes in the fucking world.
2867240	2868240	I love it.
2868240	2870240	That and Tweety Bird for some reason.
2870240	2872240	I love stereotypes that make no sense.
2872240	2873240	Tweety Bird and Morrissey.
2873240	2875240	And I have ten pairs of Morrissey on me.
2875240	2876240	Tweety Bird loves Morrissey.
2876240	2877240	Yeah.
2877240	2878240	I saw Tweety Bird.
2878240	2879240	He was wearing a Morrissey shirt.
2879240	2880240	It's amazing.
2880240	2881240	Yeah.
2881240	2882240	But we're like, do we do it?
2882240	2887240	And I felt like if we tell the room here that Morrissey is here, it will be an avalanche
2887240	2888240	of people.
2888240	2891240	Because, you know, he's like their main man.
2891240	2893240	And he was hiding kind of in the shadows.
2893240	2896240	And right before we were about to pull the trigger, he could just sense it and got up
2896240	2899240	with his whole entourage and just slipped out the side.
2899240	2901240	Like, well, way to go, Morrissey.
2901240	2902240	Really?
2902240	2904240	Morrissey that one, didn't you, Morrissey?
2904240	2907240	I don't belong here, said Morrissey.
2907240	2912240	Slipping out, going out the door.
2912240	2914240	I don't know what he sounds like.
2914240	2916240	I've only heard Morrissey impression.
2916240	2918240	I've never heard Morrissey.
2918240	2920240	He's kind of monotone you all.
2920240	2922240	It's like, oh, every song ends on this note.
2922240	2924240	I never saw every verse in this note.
2924240	2925240	I'm on this note.
2925240	2926240	I'm on this note.
2926240	2927240	This note.
2927240	2928240	Different note.
2928240	2929240	Effect that note.
2929240	2930240	This note.
2930240	2934240	Every song is for the shittiest songwriter.
2934240	2938240	And I've listened to some Morrissey songs that I can kind of dig.
2938240	2942240	But the problem with me and Morrissey was I was the right age to be in high school with
2942240	2943240	people.
2943240	2945240	The people that were into Morrissey were just a bunch of assholes.
2945240	2946240	Yes.
2946240	2948240	Not like the cool high school.
2948240	2950240	Well, now I apologize to the Latino community.
2950240	2951240	And it ruined.
2951240	2953240	And get specific about.
2953240	2955240	And buy alcohol for it.
2955240	2956240	All right.
2956240	2958240	Goldberg, you got another?
2958240	2962240	I got another hot quiz, some hot goss.
2962240	2964240	It's called the hot cue, man.
2964240	2966240	Oh, sorry.
2966240	2968240	This one's pretty tricky.
2968240	2970240	I got five episodes.
2970240	2972240	Let's make it four episodes.
2972240	2976240	I don't think Dan can put them in order by air date.
2976240	2977240	Okay.
2977240	2979240	So these are going to be four episodes.
2979240	2986240	First, wide, grumble snakes, complete access to air.
2986240	2991240	And live at the Gramercy New York Comedy Festival 2015 night two.
2991240	2992240	All right.
2992240	2994240	Well, complete access to air is last.
2994240	2997240	Working backwards from that would be wide.
2997240	2999240	And then the one that's not the Gramercy.
2999240	3003240	Or no, then Gramercy and then whatever one's left out.
3003240	3008240	So it would be grumble snakes wide, live, complete access?
3008240	3011240	Wait.
3011240	3015240	Grumble snakes, Gramercy, wide.
3015240	3019240	No.
3019240	3021240	This question is boiling.
3021240	3022240	It's so hot.
3022240	3029240	Grumble snakes, Gramercy, wide, and access to air.
3029240	3033240	I want someone to get four new pets and name them those.
3033240	3035240	I mean, grumble snakes is a great name.
3035240	3039240	The actual order was grumble snakes, wide, live, and then complete.
3039240	3040240	I almost switched it to that.
3040240	3041240	Those are in separate years.
3041240	3042240	But then again, that's not really a feat.
3042240	3043240	Oh, shit.
3043240	3044240	That was a good shit.
3044240	3045240	Okay.
3045240	3046240	Now, Dan, can I combine?
3046240	3047240	That was a hot cue.
3047240	3048240	Can I combine two hot cues?
3048240	3050240	I think these are two hot cues that go great together.
3050240	3051240	Okay.
3051240	3055240	Now, the hot cues, just to get the terminology down, you're asking the hot cues off of Twitter.
3055240	3056240	Off of Twitter.
3056240	3057240	Is the hot cues a hashtag?
3057240	3058240	Because they're sizzling hot.
3058240	3059240	They're coming off of Twitter's griddle.
3059240	3060240	Twitter griddles.
3060240	3061240	Twitter griddle.
3061240	3065240	Goldberg is asking kind of like a best served cold quiz questions.
3065240	3066240	Yeah.
3066240	3067240	Right.
3067240	3069240	They've been warming up on the counter.
3069240	3070240	Yeah.
3070240	3071240	They're pet cemetery flashbacks.
3071240	3073240	They're in the danger zone where bacteria...
3073240	3079240	Let's do one more Goldberg hot quiz and then I think we'll take it back to the hashtag
3079240	3082240	What about the two cues that went great together?
3082240	3083240	I'm with Spencer on this one.
3083240	3084240	What about those?
3084240	3085240	Goldberg's cues.
3085240	3086240	These are hot cues.
3086240	3091600	Goldberg's are hot cues that got hit by a car and their dad buried them in a Native American
3091600	3095240	burial ground and now they're back but something's different.
3095240	3097240	All right.
3097240	3100240	I don't want to ask questions.
3100240	3101240	Go ahead, Jeff.
3101240	3102240	Jeff, you acted like you thought.
3102240	3103240	Yeah, they were so good.
3103240	3104240	I was just talking a bit.
3104240	3105240	What were you going to say?
3105240	3106240	I got you.
3106240	3107240	Okay.
3107240	3110960	I felt bad because I was actually enjoying the hot quiz and I felt bad for trying to
3110960	3111960	railroad that internet.
3111960	3112960	Oh, no, no, no.
3112960	3113960	That's not...
3113960	3114960	We can do both.
3114960	3115960	I was going back and forth between the two.
3115960	3116960	Okay.
3116960	3117960	These cues might be so cold by now.
3117960	3119960	I think we might have a thousand hotter cues but these are ones I've seen.
3119960	3121240	I'm going to combine two.
3121240	3125240	A guy or a gal and I'm going to get this name wrong.
3125240	3126240	At R.I.
3126240	3127240	Jerk.
3127240	3128240	Rijerk.
3128240	3129240	Rijerk.
3129240	3130240	Rijerk.
3130240	3133240	Ask something along the lines of when you're going to make this show funky and drop a funky
3133240	3134240	beat.
3134240	3135240	Ah.
3136240	3143920	I'm going to combine that with a hotter, more recent, off the Twitter griddle cue of Joel
3143920	3144920	Spielberg.
3144920	3146920	Was that somebody who had him on the show before or am I just beginning to speak?
3146920	3147920	Joel Spielberg.
3147920	3148920	Joel Spielberg.
3148920	3149920	Didn't we have him on the show before?
3149920	3150920	I'm just...
3150920	3151920	I didn't make jobs.
3151920	3152920	I'm Joel Spielberg.
3152920	3158520	I'm going to combine Rijerk's question of when am I going to drop a funky beat so that
3158520	3160720	Dan starts making the show funky with...
3160720	3162720	You sure you didn't say funny?
3162720	3163720	Funky.
3163720	3164720	Okay.
3165720	3172720	Joel Spielberg's question, which is would you ask Dan to do Ice-T explaining the simulation?
3178720	3183640	And I believe Zach McKeever back here, our sound tech genius extraordinaire, has a beat
3183640	3185640	by one of our loyal Hermenians, right?
3185640	3186640	Harry Foster?
3186640	3187640	Yeah.
3187640	3188640	Let's drop that beat.
3188640	3189640	Alright.
3189640	3192640	Ice-T explaining the simulation in a rap.
3192640	3193640	Yeah.
3193640	3194640	Go ahead.
3194640	3195640	Yo.
3195640	3196640	Alright.
3196640	3197640	Right about now.
3197640	3198640	It's time to get serious.
3198640	3199640	Not that I'm ever not serious.
3199640	3200640	Yeah.
3200640	3201640	But there's a thing called the simulation.
3201640	3205640	And you can't see it when you're standing in one place, son, because it's all around
3205640	3208640	and the sound of my voice is being simulated.
3208640	3209640	So fuck you.
3209640	3210640	The simulation in your ass.
3210640	3211640	Yo.
3211640	3212640	A simulation in your asshole.
3212640	3213640	There once was a boy named John sitting on the front lawn selling cracks, rolling like
3213640	3214640	that.
3214640	3215640	What the fuck?
3215640	3216640	Your mama's pussy so hot she had a heart attack.
3216640	3217640	Yeah.
3217640	3218640	Yeah.

3260640	3261640	Yeah.
3261640	3262640	Yeah.
3262640	3265140	Yeah I want you to be wonderful, little girl, as you start what what.
3265140	3265640	In the business or out of work or something like that.
3265640	3266640	Yeah.
3266640	3269640	I can't believe I didn't sound like ice tea since the beginning of this rap.
3269640	3271640	But okay it's not personal.
3271640	3272640	It's business.
3272640	3273640	It's not personal.
3273640	3274640	It's business.
3274640	3277640	That's my not gonna do it for ice tea.
3277640	3281640	Brings me back to the impression, look at these splits, see.
3281640	3282640	Okay.
3282640	3284640	Simulation, not personal, not gonna do it.
3284640	3285640	Nation.
3285640	3287640	Simulation, ice tea nation.
3287640	3289640	The simulation is causing fascination.
3289640	3290640	Why?
3290640	3291640	Is it the matrix?
3291640	3292640	Are we a battery?
3292640	3294640	Well that concept don't work thermonuclearly.
3295640	3297640	Yo, you gotta take it to the spot.
3297640	3299640	Fuck your mama so hard that she got hot.
3299640	3301640	I made her friction.
3301640	3302640	Now that makes a charge.
3302640	3305640	I fucked your mama like my name was Al DeBarge.
3309640	3311640	It's time for the Rob Shroff, Rihanna Hook.
3311640	3313640	Rob, can you sing the hook?
3314640	3319640	Simulation.
3320640	3322640	Simulation.
3322640	3323640	It's not real.
3323640	3325640	It's not not not real.
3325640	3327640	Simulation.
3327640	3329640	It's all in your head if you're ever someone else's name.
3329640	3331640	Get your asshole.
3331640	3333640	Get your asshole.
3333640	3335640	The second matrix one that's under appreciate.
3335640	3336640	Pause.
3336640	3337640	Dakota Jaws.
3337640	3339640	I will tell your mama that she look like Santa Claus.
3339640	3340640	Yeah.
3340640	3342640	Going up a chimney up onto the roof.
3342640	3345640	I swear to your mama so hard I'm gonna look like Dr. Ruth.
3345640	3347640	I'm an expert in sexuality.
3347640	3349640	I'm simulating everything.
3349640	3350640	It's not reality.
3350640	3353640	I eat her pussy so good it ain't real.
3353640	3354640	It's a simulation.
3354640	3355640	That's how she feels.
3355640	3358640	She comes too hard to make it life.
3358640	3360640	I fucked your mama as sharp as a knife.
3360640	3361640	Ugh.
3361640	3363640	Let's don't mix those images.
3365640	3367640	That's some seven shit.
3371640	3373640	I love the ladies around the street.
3373640	3376640	I love the hot dogs made of all kinds of meat.
3376640	3378640	That's a simulation and it tastes good.
3378640	3381640	So if you had a simulation wouldn't you do it?
3381640	3383640	Just do it.
3383640	3386640	Skateboards are fun.
3386640	3387640	Ice cream.
3387640	3388640	Television.
3388640	3390640	Dinosaur stories.
3390640	3392640	Everything about this world is great.
3392640	3393640	Sort of plate to plate.
3393640	3396640	You're gonna go across the nation and there's nothing to hate.
3396640	3398640	Cause I'm having good times and swimming in pools.
3398640	3401640	If there was a simulation it would have three rules.
3401640	3402640	Rule number one.
3402640	3403640	Love ice tea.
3403640	3404640	Rule number two.
3404640	3406640	It's all about me.
3406640	3407640	Rule number three.
3407640	3408640	I made your mama pee.
3408640	3411640	I fucked her so hard she can't even see.
3411640	3412640	Yo.
3412640	3413640	She got cockash.
3419640	3420640	Three rules.
3420640	3421640	Three rules.
3421640	3423640	Best rap ever.
3423640	3425640	That was the best rap ever.
3428640	3430640	That was without a doubt.
3430640	3432640	Without a doubt.
3432640	3434640	Holy shit.
3437640	3440640	I'm so glad we're all here right now.
3442640	3445640	Please tell me we were recording.
3445640	3450640	I started the show saying that you were bad at rap and good at rock and roll.
3450640	3452640	No tonight you're good at everything.
3453640	3454640	Yeah.
3456640	3459640	Does anybody here, did anybody here bring a cello?
3462640	3466640	Can we get a little side assist for Zach McKeever laying down the beat from our friend?
3467640	3468640	Harry Forrester.
3468640	3473640	But also, he was mixing with you live and doing like the live tassel.
3473640	3479640	That's the thing I was gonna say is that like Zach, Jack drops the audio on the rhyme beats.
3479640	3485640	And that's like the equivalent of like that's like the makeup airbrushing of you know like that's that's a big deal.
3485640	3487640	Like that's like the that's like the foundation.
3487640	3494640	But it was like you both knew is gonna happen at the same time and there was a couple rhymes in there that I think are gonna last for a while.
3494640	3496640	There was a lot going on.
3496640	3497640	That was heavy.
3497640	3501640	I'd like to give special mention to the elder barge reference now.
3501640	3510640	Because Dan's references like mine are frozen like before 89.
3510640	3513640	What were what were ice tees rules?
3513640	3515640	Love ice tea.
3515640	3516640	Rule number two.
3516640	3517640	It's all about me.
3517640	3519640	Rule number three.
3519640	3520640	I made your mama pee.
3520640	3521640	I fuck her so hard.
3521640	3522640	Your mama can't see.
3526640	3527640	Oh my God.
3528640	3530640	I kind of wish I wasn't here right now.
3532640	3533640	I wish I wasn't here.
3533640	3540640	I want to be listening in my lonely Miami apartment shooting that weird show.
3540640	3546640	Go all alone in my underwear and I jump up cheering.
3546640	3551640	If you if you had Wayne Brady on the stage he would have been like oh fuck I put him out of here.
3551640	3552640	I would get out of here.
3552640	3553640	That was really good.
3553640	3554640	Well thanks.
3554640	3556640	It's too bad Gray Worm wasn't here for that.
3556640	3559640	He could have done the hooks and what a great 200.
3559640	3560640	Wow.
3560640	3561640	He really did it.
3561640	3563640	It would be okay for the rest of the episode to suck.
3563640	3564640	You can just fucking.
3564640	3565640	Hey.
3565640	3566640	Hey.
3566640	3568640	What are we going to do for another 53 minutes.
3568640	3571640	Here comes Rob to fuck it up.
3572640	3574640	Like a reverse Santa Claus.
3574640	3575640	Rob.
3575640	3576640	What did it.
3576640	3577640	Go easy man.
3577640	3578640	He just had a real big moment.
3578640	3579640	Don't worry Rob.
3579640	3580640	He's not real.
3580640	3581640	Rob.
3581640	3583640	What did I do in the Norman Lear episode.
3583640	3585640	I thought I was in really good.
3585640	3586640	Oh my God.
3586640	3588640	20 minute improvised card trick.
3588640	3590640	You can't improvise a card trick.
3590640	3591640	You didn't even have cards.
3591640	3593640	You made people make you cards.
3593640	3595640	That's what I do.
3595640	3597640	That was before he even came out.
3597640	3598640	Exactly.
3598640	3599640	You don't open for fucking.
3599640	3600640	Okay.
3600640	3601640	Okay Dan.
3601640	3602640	The Beatles.
3602640	3603640	Dan.
3603640	3604640	Dan.
3604640	3605640	Daniel.
3605640	3606640	Dan.
3606640	3607640	It's okay.
3607640	3608640	We've talked about this.
3608640	3609640	Rob.
3609640	3610640	What did I do.
3610640	3611640	What did you.
3611640	3612640	Come on.
3612640	3613640	What did I do that was so bad.
3613640	3614640	All right.
3614640	3615640	I was really nice.
3615640	3616640	To Norman Lear.
3616640	3617640	Nice to you.
3617640	3619640	Oh you've always been nice to me.
3619640	3620640	We're good friends.
3620640	3621640	Yeah.
3621640	3622640	I know this is not.
3622640	3623640	I.
3623640	3628640	There was a couple of episodes where I was like.
3628640	3629640	Trump.
3629640	3631640	I thought it would be a good bit.
3631640	3632640	To tell you the truth.
3632640	3633640	Yeah.
3633640	3634640	I wish I was there.
3634640	3636640	My bit right now.
3636640	3640640	Would be to tell Trump to shut up.
3640640	3644640	That's that's actually what it was probably would be helpful.
3644640	3646640	It would be a great bit right.
3646640	3647640	It would be good.
3647640	3648640	Shut up.
3648640	3649640	Hey.
3649640	3650640	Robert.

3654640	3655640	Yeah.
3655640	3656640	That'd be funny right.
3656640	3658640	You do that the rest of the.
3658640	3659640	That'd be funny.
3659640	3660640	We could still do that.
3660640	3661640	We could still do that.
3661640	3662640	A lot of.
3662640	3664640	But if you're still if you're not being.
3664640	3665640	If you're not.
3665640	3666640	Feeling it.
3666640	3667640	No.
3667640	3668640	But if you're.
3668640	3669640	Quiet.
3669640	3670640	You're not like.
3670640	3674640	I'm only going to scold you when I feel like you're scoldable.
3674640	3675640	Thank you.
3675640	3677640	That's what I'll make the bit really fun.
3677640	3678640	Thank you.
3678640	3679640	Thank you.
3679640	3680640	Thank you.
3680640	3685640	That would be a real good idea if somebody would do that for a change.
3685640	3687640	When I deserve it.
3687640	3688640	Robert.
3688640	3689640	I've.
3689640	3690640	Yeah.
3690640	3691640	See we're just testing out the bit.
3691640	3692640	Well you know.
3692640	3693640	Testing out the bit.
3693640	3694640	I missed a hot cue.
3694640	3697640	Well that was one of the world's best rap was going on somebody.
3697640	3702640	Somebody pitched a mid world's best rap thing that there should have been wolves in there
3702640	3705640	so Spencer could have come up and wolf fight during that rap.
3705640	3713400	Everyone has a completely different animals coyotes are different wolves I could not take
3713400	3714400	on wolves.
3714400	3715400	Oh as coyotes.
3715400	3716400	Let me be real clear.
3716400	3719240	That was certainly one of the highlights I wish we could do a clip show that would be
3719240	3723240	like Johnny Carson would do because that would be one of the clips would be Spencer demonstrating
3723240	3729320	how he would it is 9 11 and it's a 200th episode.
3729320	3735520	It's time to talk about politics.
3735520	3741200	That disaster reminds me of another that the but yeah Spencer demonstrating you know how
3741200	3749360	he would fight off a gang of coyotes using only a backpack and his feet that he added
3749360	3752800	he had figured it out what would the concept of our clip show be.
3752800	3753800	What would we.
3753800	3756760	Well that there would be that clip and then there would be like oh we're all stuck in
3756760	3761640	the nerd milk at it and we have to keep warm by remembering things about Armandown.
3761640	3762640	Oh right.
3762640	3766640	You actually had a really really good concept for a clip shows that's why I'm asking.
3766640	3768960	Yeah well I think that's a pretty good one.
3768960	3769960	You could do it.
3769960	3773960	We're cleaning up the Mr. Meltdown it's like clean up the attic.
3773960	3774960	Clean up the attic.
3774960	3781400	Why did I name myself Mr. Meltdown itself for feeling prophecy oh god.
3781400	3784560	I feel like I should be just a whole montage of Anatoly's shirts.
3784560	3785560	Yes.
3786360	3787360	Yeah.
3787360	3794160	Watching Anatoly's posture change from like Yakov Smirnoff to fucking like like Dracula
3794160	3799960	where he was just like his feet were up at the back of the stage because he became Rasputin
3799960	3802960	where he was here.
3802960	3803960	He is here.
3803960	3804960	Yeah.
3804960	3805960	But he's kind of like my girlfriend.
3805960	3806960	She's not.
3806960	3807960	Well he's kind of like my girlfriend.
3807960	3812760	But he's also kind of similar to my girlfriend and that you're not much of a showman.
3812960	3813960	I don't know.
3813960	3818860	I'm just saying like I like to I'm a big fan of the show and I like connecting with people
3818860	3822960	that I've heard their names and you're one of them and what's up.
3822960	3825960	Andy will you come up and just sit just for a second.
3834360	3835360	You know me.
3835360	3836360	I didn't mean to do it.
3836360	3837360	I do know you.
3837360	3838360	I do know you.
3838360	3841560	So you started coming coming pretty early in the run.
3841560	3842560	Oh.
3842560	3843560	Yeah.
3843560	3844560	Like four years ago.
3844560	3845560	Do you always.
3845560	3846560	For years.
3846560	3847560	Four years.
3847560	3848560	That's kind of cold.
3848560	3850560	That's why I met Adam and Spencer.
3850560	3852560	We only do 50 episodes a year.
3854560	3855560	Yeah.
3855560	3856560	We do.
3856560	3857560	We do less than 50 a year.
3857560	3858560	That's pretty good.
3858560	3859560	That's good.
3859560	3860560	Kind of be a way we can push that envelope.
3860560	3861560	I know.
3861560	3862560	What does Marin do.
3862560	3864560	I was just thinking we've we've lost.
3864560	3866560	There's Dan Dan 53.
3866560	3867560	Fucking.
3867560	3870560	Isn't this like episode 204 or something technically.
3870560	3871560	Are you one of those people.
3871560	3872560	It's like.
3872560	3873560	This was born in.
3873560	3874560	Yeah.
3874560	3875560	Spencer.
3875560	3876560	Spencer.
3876560	3877560	Jesus was.
3877560	3878560	Spencer.
3878560	3879560	No.
3879560	3880560	No.
3880560	3881560	Spencer.
3881560	3888560	It's just a celebration of the equinox.
3888560	3890560	You guys killed the shadow people.
3890560	3891560	It was great.
3891560	3892560	Yeah.
3892560	3894560	Well do you mean that because we did a several episodes before we actually
3894560	3895560	started.
3895560	3896560	Now there's just unreleased episodes.
3896560	3897560	Oh there are unreleased episodes.
3897560	3901560	There's one where I got super duper drunk and probably coked up and like
3901560	3903560	announced my return to community.
3903560	3904560	You're admitting you do coke now.
3904560	3906560	Like way before I was supposed to.
3906560	3908560	I think I think I don't think we played.
3908560	3910560	We should have had a lot more unaired episodes by the way.
3910560	3911560	Yeah.
3911560	3914560	There was one where I went into a lot of detail explaining the whole Chevy
3914560	3915560	Chase thing.
3915560	3917560	There's episodes that you haven't aired because you were.
3917560	3918560	They were that bad.
3918560	3920560	That was too drunk man.
3920560	3923560	I really want to get a hold of those.
3923560	3926560	Well I listened to because we were going to release them at one point the last
3926560	3930560	two episodes but I had been through so I'd like I had to go through a lot of
3930560	3934560	my personas like like I had to come around to the realization and the
3934560	3936560	Internet had to become the Internet became everyone's life.
3936560	3939560	There was a point when the Internet was just a place where people kind of
3939560	3943560	huddled even after it was only nerds it was still then it was just like social
3943560	3945560	misfits and it was always there.
3945560	3949560	I'm sounding defensive but there was a there was a point in the in the
3949560	3953560	Internet's existence where it was still kind of it felt okay to just sort of
3953560	3954560	expose yourself.
3954560	3956560	I wasn't like famous.
3956560	3960560	So I would like write blogs about like like like my friends and what they were
3960560	3961560	doing.
3961560	3964560	I would never do that now because it's like it feels like ever since.
3964560	3968560	You weren't so aware that other people were human.
3968560	3970560	Looking at you.
3970560	3971560	Yeah.
3971560	3972560	Reading it.
3972560	3974560	Oh no people were like actually aware of this.
3974560	3977560	The days of my Myspace blog it was like oh in your wildest dreams someone
3977560	3980560	would find this written on this coconut that you threw into the ocean and oh
3980560	3982560	sure enough there's there's my friend Kelly Oxford.
3982560	3985560	She's she's she's she's responding in the comments and we're friends because
3985560	3988560	she's one of the few people reading or you know my friends are reading.
3988560	3990560	It's like there's 600 people reading your Myspace blog.
3990560	3994560	So you're kind of like gossip girl in terms of like what you're saying.
3994560	3995560	I'm assuming she gossips.
3995560	4000560	I don't know the the but then the and then you flash forward to like the Chevy
4000560	4004560	Chase event which was like I and I still I wasn't trying to put that on the
4004560	4005560	Internet.
4005560	4007560	I was that was before we started podcasting.
4007560	4009560	I was playing into the microphone here.
4009560	4013560	I thought you know dumbly like let's just enjoy this for a second.
4013560	4017560	And then one person was like yeah you just enjoy it for a second.
4017560	4020560	But and then and then I was that person here tonight.
4020560	4021560	What if that person is it.
4021560	4022560	Why don't you stand up.
4022560	4023560	It's Nick.
4023560	4026560	Let's bring up Chevy Chase Chevy Chase.
4026560	4029560	But then I was like oh I'm affecting other people's lives.
4029560	4031560	I have to stick to talking about myself.
4031560	4033560	I can't remember why we were talking about this.
4033560	4035560	But what was the point.
4035560	4036560	Oh no idea.
4036560	4037560	Yeah.
4037560	4038560	Lost episodes.
4038560	4039560	Because so there's a lot.
4039560	4041560	There's last episodes where it's like I'm talking about community and I'm
4041560	4042560	talking about Chevy Chase.
4042560	4043560	It was like with the community thing.
4043560	4046560	It was like oh the fans are like they're getting bummed out every time I open
4046560	4047560	my mouth.
4047560	4051560	I just want to like don't want them to be touched by my thing you know.
4051560	4055560	And then it sounds like a penis.
4055560	4057560	I mean they're already trapped in a van with me.
4057560	4059560	The least I can do is following.
4059560	4062560	And then the Chevy thing obviously it was like oh Jesus.
4062560	4063560	I've done enough there.
4063560	4067560	So but but but in that episode I do explain explain like what happened.
4067560	4070560	I think it's the actual episode where I played it.
4070560	4071560	That was right.
4071560	4072560	It was recorded.
4072560	4074560	It's the last episode because we never had a podcasting it.
4074560	4075560	Anyways.
4075560	4077560	I just read it on 200 episode.
4077560	4080560	We go by iTunes counting the episodes that we upload.
4080560	4081560	It's our 200th episode.
4081560	4082560	Yes.
4082560	4083560	Spencer.
4089560	4091560	So Spencer.
4091560	4093560	What do you think happens when you die.
4093560	4094560	You.
4094560	4096560	What happens when Spencer dies.
4096560	4097560	What.
4097560	4099560	What happens when you die.
4099560	4100560	You stop living.
4100560	4102560	Do you have any insurance is what he's asking.
4102560	4103560	No.
4103560	4105560	Is there just a bloody long term pet.
4105560	4106560	Probably oblivion right.
4106560	4108560	I don't know.
4108560	4109560	And why.
4109560	4110560	Why think about that.
4110560	4114560	I got so much other shit to worry about.
4114560	4116560	What you're worrying about.
4116560	4123560	I'm I'm writing or I know you know working on Harmon quest coming to see so.
4123560	4124560	I love that attitude.
4124560	4125560	I don't care about death.
4125560	4126560	I have a TV show.
4126560	4127560	Yeah.
4127560	4132560	I'll worry about death when I stop having a TV show makes sense.
4132560	4133560	That's literally what happened.
4133560	4135560	That's why he went on tour.
4135560	4138560	I'm sure I'm sure King Tut didn't call for the pyramids to be made like during some big
4138560	4144560	battle like like like you should kill those people and enslave those Jews at the exact
4144560	4147560	same time build giant pyramids that everyone can see the whole time.
4147560	4149560	I'm sure he was like there's no more Jews to enslave.
4149560	4150560	What should I do with them.
4150560	4151560	What if you had.
4151560	4156560	What if my tomb was a fucking city.
4156560	4157560	What if you had to navigate by.
4157560	4158560	All right Dan.

4174560	4175560	I'm going to.
4175560	4176560	I'm going to lay my own bed on this.

4194560	4195560	This is a contract.
4195560	4197560	That's me saying I have a small dick.

4380560	4382560	You're saying right now.
4382560	4386560	I mean if Adam could do 40 like 50 minutes you could do 20.
4386560	4390560	It was worth it though just to get a glimpse of street tough anti for a second.
4390560	4392560	That was a hard fuck.
4392560	4397560	You took my fucking seat you Goldberg.
4397560	4399560	Didn't expect that from you.
4399560	4401560	All right Dan somebody else.

4421560	4426560	Well yeah but just kill me that fuck marry me.
4426560	4430560	Yeah but what if what if fucking you could kill you.
4430560	4433560	What if someone could fuck you so hard.
4433560	4435560	That's so satisfying.
4435560	4436560	You would die of pleasure.
4436560	4441560	You just said that you fuck a pussy with a knife.
4441560	4442560	Wait a minute.
4442560	4446560	Stop that.

4475560	4477560	That's Chris Katan.
4477560	4482560	I'm gonna kill Chris Katan and fuck him after he's dead.
4482560	4484560	Well I think both he and Rob Schneider if they're listening
4484560	4486560	might just have killed themselves.
4486560	4488560	You're like yeah okay.
4488560	4489560	All right.
4489560	4492560	Yeah I'll kill Schneider because I don't know him.
4492560	4498560	And so then I'm marrying.
4498560	4502560	I'll marry Schwab because again you're kind of an NT.
4502560	4503560	We could figure it out.
4503560	4504560	We're gonna fuck.
4504560	4505560	You're from Boston.
4505560	4506560	No.

4536560	4541560	NT what do you feel like you've either learned or unlearned after all these Harmon Town episodes?
4541560	4543560	Because for a while you wisely stopped coming.
4543560	4545560	Like I think everybody should.
4545560	4547560	Did you need a break?
4547560	4550560	I took like a two and a half year break.
4550560	4553560	I mean I don't know if I learned anything.
4553560	4556560	I've never tried so little to be a part of something.
4556560	4560560	You're already accepted.
4560560	4563560	It's that easy.
4563560	4568560	Even 4H needs to have 4H's.
4568560	4571560	Okay now the joke did not land.
4571560	4573560	Is 4H like a regional thing?
4573560	4574560	I did not get it.
4574560	4575560	I didn't get that.
4575560	4576560	4H is like a.
4576560	4577560	It's rural.
4577560	4578560	Okay all right.
4578560	4579560	Wait what is it?
4579560	4580560	Dave Klein.
4580560	4581560	Even though.
4581560	4583560	Dave Klein's trying to explain the joke to me.
4583560	4584560	Wait real quick.
4584560	4587560	Somebody asked the easiest answerable hot cue.
4587560	4589560	Is Dave Klein in the house?
4589560	4590560	Of course he is.
4590560	4592560	So let's bring Dave Klein up for.
4592560	4593560	He's been rambunctious.
4593560	4594560	Dave Klein.
4594560	4595560	He's my favorite person.
4595560	4596560	Dave Klein.
4596560	4597560	Let me.
4597560	4598560	Dave Klein.
4598560	4600560	I could be thrown off the stage at any point.
4600560	4602560	That's the thing that none of you know.
4602560	4603560	Uh oh.
4603560	4605560	I'll have what he's had.
4605560	4607560	So all I can say before I'm thrown out.
4607560	4608560	You're blocking NT.
4608560	4609560	Thank you.
4609560	4610560	No.

4614560	4615560	No.
4615560	4616560	No.
4616560	4617560	No.
4617560	4618560	No.
4618560	4619560	No.
4619560	4620560	Thank you.
4620560	4621560	No.
4621560	4622560	No.

4623560	4624560	No.
4624560	4625560	Yeah.
4625560	4626560	We need it.
4626560	4627560	We need it.
4627560	4628560	That's what I'm doing.
4628560	4629560	We need the whole joke.
4629560	4630560	That's my job.
4630560	4631560	I'm in the Rob Corddry corner.
4631560	4632560	That's all I'm saying.
4632560	4633560	I'm the sheriff of Harmentown.
4633560	4636560	You need to have like a white button up shirt and a ruler.
4636560	4637560	I'm the sheriff.
4637560	4639560	I pick up the sheriff of Harmentown.
4639560	4641560	You stand right there.
4641560	4642560	David.
4642560	4643560	No.
4643560	4648320	David's just like a guy in the scene where like there's a bunch of people like like
4648320	4653680	hordes men and they're eating like drinking out of big like wooden goblets and like they're
4653680	4656080	eating like turkey legs with their hands.
4656080	4658680	He's definitely a drug dealer in a Broadway musical.
4658680	4667360	He looks like like like like like set sets a Broadway musical set in a world where songs
4667360	4673320	are illegal and and you and you sell out you sell black market songs like the drummer from
4674320	4683320	The only indictment that I ever saw was my birth certificate.
4683320	4685320	Oh shit.
4685320	4688320	Is that is that don't don't woe him.
4688320	4692320	Well is that is that copyrighted because if it is we might have to lift it.
4692320	4693320	That's a freestyle jam.
4693320	4694320	I can throw a freestyle jam.
4694320	4696320	Don't don't step darling.
4696320	4697320	Don't step on your glasses.
4697320	4698320	They fell off.
4698320	4699320	They're right underneath.
4699320	4706320	Well I lost one I lost I lost one leg in a in a intimate moment.
4706320	4708320	That's okay but just don't step on your glasses.
4708320	4711320	Is that what the things glasses are called legs?
4711320	4712320	Arms.
4712320	4713320	Okay.
4713320	4714320	They're called arms.
4714320	4715320	All right.
4715320	4716320	He calls them legs.
4716320	4722320	He's he's wearing a seat cover.
4722320	4724320	He can call that whatever he wants to call it.
4724320	4728640	They only have two things I'd rather picture them having legs so that they can run around
4728640	4733080	saying I don't have arms than picturing them like pulling themselves along saying one of
4733080	4740840	us I was real fortunate my first ever film course ever was with Andrew Sarris and he
4740840	4750200	he had a class called musicals and he told us gentlemen and ladies I have one thing you
4750200	4761960	need to know you either know how to choreograph a leg or you don't snap into a slim gym.
4761960	4762960	Yes.
4762960	4765160	Did the iron sheet come out right after him?
4765160	4766160	It was close.
4766160	4767160	It was close.
4767160	4768160	Hit him with a folding chair.
4768160	4769160	Yep.
4769160	4773840	Dave you seem an awfully good form right now and I think it might possibly be in charge
4773840	4775240	of this giant can of fosters.
4775240	4776240	Oh well.
4776240	4777240	Although you've barely got.
4777280	4783960	I'd like to give a shout out to Australia because a nation no not New Zealand but Australia
4783960	4791400	a nation built on the social experiment of the best prisoners and minds they could get.
4791400	4796080	I'm just saying like I don't want to see like a lot of Australia stuff like necessarily.
4796080	4800960	I'm just saying like as America becomes more and more a social experiment.
4800960	4806040	He's like we got to give some shout outs to the social experiments of your like like like
4806040	4811720	let's put the let's put the let's put our criminals and our masterminds on an island.
4811720	4815440	Yeah because a lot of them were they weren't just like murderers or you know like thugs
4815440	4820520	then a lot of them were spies like very some of them were koalas.
4820520	4821520	No no no.
4821520	4822520	Dickensian.
4822520	4823520	No.
4823520	4824520	No.
4824520	4825520	No.
4825520	4826520	No.
4826520	4827520	I agree.
4827520	4829760	England made a big mistake by sending Australia all of England's koalas.
4829760	4830760	I know.
4830760	4831760	Because they never got them back.
4831760	4832760	Yeah.
4832760	4833760	Classic.
4833760	4834760	But they're much happier there.
4834760	4835760	I know.
4835960	4837520	It's not Paddington who led them there right?
4837520	4838520	What's that?
4838520	4839520	Oh well.
4839520	4840520	With his flute of marmalade?
4840520	4841520	Oh Paddington Bear.
4841520	4842520	Paddington Bear of 1812.
4842520	4846920	I want to apologize to Rob Schneider for thinking he was the guy in Corky.
4846920	4847920	No.
4847920	4848920	I feel terrible about this.
4848920	4849920	Yeah.
4849920	4853440	Rob Schneider's like what do I have to do to distinguish myself?
4853440	4855440	Rob Schneider is fine.
4855440	4856440	I...
4856440	4860080	Do I have to make a 500th movie?
4860080	4861120	Yeah.
4861120	4862120	Uh.
4862120	4864200	Because I will.
4864320	4865320	I'm Rob Schneider.
4865320	4866320	Well.
4866320	4867320	I mean.
4867320	4868320	I mean.
4868320	4869320	Cut.
4869320	4870320	His.
4870320	4871320	Fucking.
4871320	4872320	Head.
4872320	4873320	Off.
4873320	4874320	Okay.
4874320	4875320	Dave Klein is gripping that microphone so tightly.
4875320	4876320	Well.
4876320	4878640	It feels like the ball of it will smash.
4878640	4879640	Okay.
4879640	4880640	Uh.
4880640	4881640	I'm only going to say this.
4881640	4882640	Thanks.
4882640	4883640	Well.
4883640	4884640	I'm from the East.
4884640	4885640	I don't believe that for a second.
4885640	4886640	Right.
4886640	4887640	No.
4887640	4888640	That's just a lie.
4888640	4893480	I'm from the East Coast and if there's something I'm known for, it's definitely my grip.
4893480	4900960	I got a hot cue.
4900960	4901960	I got a hot cue.
4901960	4902960	This is for the whole panel.
4902960	4903960	Okay.
4903960	4904960	Well.
4904960	4905960	I do want to ask Klein before I forgot.

4913960	4914960	Your mom was a dancer.

5730520	5738960	hours an hour to write the Beatles took less time to craft hey Jude and that song is almost like an
5738960	5745560	hour long but when we got it we knew that we'd had some you guys nailed it I've been working on

6127880	6133160	idea I just know it's to be like like I'm I'm I'm creeping when you're sleeping I'm snooping when
6133160	6138160	you're pooping I see and what you're peeing I'm and then I and then I need something like like
6138160	6145800	like like like like you know like like like like like like I'm I'm Vladimir and Putin you need
6145800	6149600	something like it needs to rhyme with like the why are you saying you still you this is a work in
6149600	6157480	progress yeah yeah I'm also like a look like I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm loading and I'm shooting cuz it cuz it
6157480	6161200	cuz it's like also like the subtext is that it's a very pleasant song but it's clearly about some
6161200	6174320	creepy man who's like in your apartment bear back bear back like Putin I'm I'm I in where you're

6541480	6552480	called Derek I would love to be able to say that you just did no but as an example but I can't just
6552480	6557760	say that normally right well because people would go what do you that would be an affect a like
6557760	6562680	they would they would they would sense some kind of strange other well it would be and I would be
6562680	6568120	affecting it right to they call them a cunt like I'd be saying a different thing I'd be
6568120	6578760	I'd be it is what can be what the C word yeah you guys are you called yeah it's like it's like it's
6578760	6584440	like it's just funny it's kind of like what like like we've managed to co-opt bitch into like you
6584440	6588560	can say it misogynistically but use but bitch can also just be like yeah like you can use it more
6588560	6593080	innocently I think the C word you could say my daughter everywhere but America they're more
6593080	6597560	comfort it's like my it's like a little rugby doll my seven-year-old my seven-year-old daughter
6597560	6610440	is just like she really is a great cunt she's speaking of cunts now so that's fuck you guys no
6610440	6617600	cool no you forced me into that you forced me into that and that was a cheap joke and I take it back
6617640	6628360	but you still laughed my daughter's obsessed with curse words right now she's obsessed with it and
6628360	6635560	the other night she was like you know that me and my wife were there and given putting her to bed
6635560	6642160	and you're like you know we if we have thoughts in our head we think something in our head it's okay
6642160	6649000	I'm like yes you can she knows it's a simulation that's what I'm getting at that's what I'm getting
6649000	6656000	at she's like yes you can think anything you want you can think anything but you just can't say
6656000	6663320	certain things like the f-word and we're like yeah that's right that's why you can't you can't
6663320	6669360	say the f-word you just can't say it's rude and she's like but you can think it
6672160	6681680	yeah you can think it she's like for instance I'm thinking it right now I'm thinking it when
6681680	6691960	I say yeah and today she just said you know dad daddy the the the worst curse word is the M F
6691960	6699720	because yeah that's a really bad one but I was like when she said that I was like oh she has no idea
6699720	6708320	about the C word she's never even had the kids in her school don't even haven't even been exposed
6708320	6714360	to that word yet yeah wait till she learns the other boy it's like just counting the minutes
6714360	6720960	if you hang out with Aussies or Kiwis or like or the Brits you know anything from UK like like C
6720960	6727880	words like every it's like it's like pepper they put it on everything it's the best yeah yeah it's
6728120	6733640	it's like the HP sauce they use it's the same thing yeah just give me it's pronounced HP in
6733640	6740360	Australia it's delicious yeah it's funny that you see your kid like she she's learning about
6740360	6746120	societal hypocrisy now she's gonna unlearn it and by the time she's like 15 or something like like
6746120	6751280	we because we get brainwashed by society yeah she'll be like like we're all geniuses when we're
6751280	6757640	too like we know that's why we're stressing like the whole the lesson is like you can
6757640	6762280	think whatever you want in your head yeah like it has nothing to do with curse words she's just
6762280	6767200	having fun with it she's just like isn't that funny I like like like 20 years from now she's
6767200	6772960	not even gonna it's just like isn't that the reason I want to kill myself because all of society is
6772960	6778600	based on thinking one thing and saying another and it's fucking good spiral until you die like
6778600	6783200	right now she's like that seems fun I'll do that for 70 years and you're like you have no idea
6783200	6789440	it's gonna it's gonna drive you insane you're gonna think language is going to lose all meaning
6789440	6796960	to you and connection will become a miracle it will become something that acts happens accidentally
6796960	6803560	and yeah and is abused Harmon that's what I feel like I'm sorry she was getting at two things

6979960	6984120	long time ago but you know you're rapping when you're around the house yeah we're talking about

6992200	6997800	doing it where I'm actually ashamed that I'm watching and if anybody else was watching I
6997800	7004440	would have stopped a long time ago but there was one lyric when I was taking a shit and I said I

7468960	7473120	what's going on I'm out of breath he said that's right you're gonna die to death and I said I'm
7473120	7477520	gonna die to death he said yeah I hit some bread and then I ate some bread and I died now I'm dead
7477520	7483680	but I went to heaven it was a simulation I saw God and I said hey well what are you doing and he
7483680	7491120	said come up with me like that I said I'm sorry I didn't try he said I've got GOD I created the
7491120	7496800	earth you're welcome for me I made the pearly gates to keep you out so you gotta go back down
7496800	7502240	you got no clout St. Peter is here to keep your ass on the other side I said fuck him until his
7502240	7507120	ass gets real wide and then I did it and I went inside and that's inside of St. Peter was like
7507120	7512640	a robot suit so then I got inside heaven but I didn't get invited I was walking around and
7512960	7519920	I was very excited because I was like Iron Man but I had St. Peter for a body and I took off my halo
7519920	7525920	and I threw it and it was a weapon and you can do it it'll come back to you like far as shield
7525920	7531440	and I bet you didn't know a halo could be wielded but I did it and I went to hell and I killed the
7531440	7536960	devil and I said well now there's a dichotomy between good and bad so now we can all go back
7537040	7542080	to earth and stop being sad we can plant trees and recycle our food
