0	17200	I love this theater, it's so cool to walk out.
17200	20880	I wish you could all stand up here and look out how groovy this is.
20880	23880	Thank you all for being here.
23880	29920	From the heart of Los Angeles to MacArthur Park where the icing is melting off the cake
29920	33760	for no reason, Harman Town is now in session.
33760	36760	Please welcome your Game Master, Spencer Crittenden.
36760	37760	Hello Spencer.
37760	38760	Hey man.
38760	39760	Is your mic good?
39760	40760	I don't know.
40760	41760	Yeah, you bet.
41760	42760	I gotta look.
42760	43760	Let's sing along.
43760	44760	How is your mic?
44760	45760	It's good.
45760	46760	It's good.
46760	47760	It's good.
47760	48760	It's good.
48760	49760	It's good.
49760	50760	It's good.
50760	51760	It's good.
51760	52760	It's good.
52760	53760	It's good.
53760	54760	It's good.
54760	55760	It's good.
55760	56760	It's good.
56760	57760	It's good.
57760	58760	It's good.
58760	59760	It's good.
59760	60760	It's good.
60760	61760	It's better.
61760	62760	It's better than a mic should be.
62760	63760	Keep going.
63760	64760	I got it for free.
64760	65760	There's free on the chairs over there.
65760	66760	Let's bring out the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
66760	67760	Yeah.
67760	68760	Thank you.
68760	69760	Thank you, Dan.
69760	70760	Yeah.
70760	81760	It's a mic check song where we sing into our mics.
81760	97760	What kind of booty does your mama like?
98760	101760	She likes it long and wide.
101760	106760	I heard she likes it inside.
106760	109760	Damn.
109760	116760	The poofiest rim.
116760	121760	Lucky him.
122760	128760	It's a blind.
128760	134760	I mean, yeah.
134760	137760	I know that.
137760	143760	I know that.
144760	149760	I remember going to your mama's house.
149760	154760	I got D. Louse afterwards.
154760	159760	I got D. Louse afterwards.
159760	164760	I got D. Louse afterwards.
164760	170760	I got D. Louse afterwards.
170760	181760	I got D. Louse afterwards by the fire department because her apartment is infested with scabies.
181760	183760	Okay.
183760	186760	Rabies.
186760	189760	Making babies.
189760	193760	There's an Indian dessert called jalebi.
193760	194760	All right.
194760	195760	Welcome, everybody.
195760	196760	Thank you for coming.
196760	197760	We did it.
197760	199760	We fucking did it again.
200760	203760	You came here for entertainment, and guess what?
203760	204760	You're already ahead.
204760	206760	The show could be over right now.
206760	207760	We could bring the curtain down.
207760	209760	What does $10 get you anywhere else, huh?
209760	213760	Like a Snickers bar and maybe like a half an Avengers movie?
213760	215760	Three quarters of a cracker.
215760	218760	What, are you going to watch the Hulk not turn into the Hulk, huh?
218760	220760	Does the Hulk not turn into the Hulk?
220760	221760	That's what I heard.
221760	222760	I don't know.
222760	223760	Spoilers.
223760	224760	I haven't seen it.
224760	228760	How does he not be a Hulk?
228760	232760	Jeff, do you notice anything different about me?
232760	234760	A certain glow, perhaps?
234760	237760	Oh, you're pregnant.
237760	238760	Close.
238760	240760	You are looking at a man in escrow.
240760	242760	Oh, damn.
242760	244760	You're going to get burnt to a house.
244760	245760	I'm in escrow.
245760	247760	You actually, you made the deal.
247760	252760	You put an offer on a house that offer was accepted.
252760	255760	Escrow was negotiated.
255760	258760	I guess that's a thing, like the length of the escrow.
258760	260760	You kind of negotiate that, too.
260760	262760	It's not the length of the escrow that matters, Dan.
262760	265760	It's the motion of the ocean.
265760	269760	Yeah, so we agreed on it, and I docu-signed a thing,
269760	273760	and we're off, I think, of a house in 30 days.
273760	276760	What will make this new house better than your current house?
276760	279760	It's giant.
279760	281760	It's bigger.
281760	284760	So how do you utilize that space?
284760	287760	Are you going to just be running around or having?
287760	289760	Well, Cody and I went through it the other day,
289760	294760	and we did realize that because initially we had this plan.
294760	296760	Like, Cody and I, we're going to go,
296760	299760	okay, we're going to have a master bedroom,
299760	304760	but then we're going to each have our own bedroom
304760	311760	so that because we like the psychological health of like,
311760	315760	hey, if we're together, we choose to be together.
315760	317760	Like, Cody still has her apartment,
317760	320760	and she's been sleeping at my place so regularly
320760	322760	that you could almost call it living with me,
322760	325760	but I think there's an important thing there for her,
325760	327760	maybe for me, too, where it's like,
327760	329760	hey, you can't take this person for granted.
329760	330760	They got their own apartment.
330760	332760	Like, they don't need to be here.
332760	336760	And getting in little squabbles and the repairing is maybe easier,
336760	340760	thinking like, hey, no one's a hostage here.
340760	344760	Yeah, and so when you want to be romantic and connect,
344760	347760	you can go back into the main sanctum.
347760	349760	Right, and that I think is the more important thing,
349760	351760	is what it does.
351760	354760	It's not about like, oh, let's prepare to be like squabbling,
354760	356760	and then people are actually going to sleep in these other rooms.
356760	358760	It probably never happened,
358760	362760	but psychologically what that transforms your master bedroom into,
362760	364760	which is like a hotel suite.
365760	369760	This is not a place for Dan to have his USB cables
369760	371760	all over the place and stuff.
371760	374760	So when we were shopping for a house,
374760	376760	we had a certain bedroom count,
376760	380760	and it was kind of ridiculous because it included two bedrooms,
380760	383760	a master bedroom, and then in addition to that,
383760	386760	we want a guest room and there's other shit that we want.
386760	390760	And so it was like, God damn, you need that many bedrooms?
390760	392760	Okay, and we found a place that has that many,
392760	395760	but the master bedroom is so,
395760	398760	it's got these gigantic walk-in closets.
398760	400760	They're like his and hers walk-in closets.
400760	403760	Like you could put a bed in my closet.
403760	405760	So I'm not going to put a bed in my closet,
405760	408760	but at the same time I feel like I could be such a pig in that closet,
408760	412760	like Cody says, as long as there are your shits behind that door,
412760	413760	I'm never going to be like...
413760	415760	Wait, what do you mean precisely?
415760	417760	Like what would be pig-ish behind this closet door?
417760	420760	I just mean like my half of my current bedroom,
421760	424760	like Cody's kind of a neat freak.
424760	428760	My half of my current bedroom looks like a 10-year-old boy's bedroom.
428760	431760	Like I just drop clothes where I take them off
431760	434760	so I can put them on tomorrow and it's just kind of,
434760	437760	and then I'll get like an electronic thing from Amazon
437760	440760	and I'll open it up and the boxes are all over the place
440760	442760	and there's like cables running everywhere
442760	445760	and I got like a USB hub where an alarm clock goes
445760	448760	and there's like cords coming out and you know.
448760	451760	They're kind of a sexy scenario where if you have the master bedroom
451760	455760	where that is the let's be together because we love each other
455760	457760	and we're going to smooch,
457760	460760	but we also have our separate rooms where we're doing our own thing.
460760	462760	Wait, when the master bedroom...
462760	464760	But we're not going to do that anymore.
464760	465760	No.
465760	468760	We decided we got these giant walk-in closets,
468760	470760	like we don't need...
470760	473760	The upshot of it is that we're walking around the house
473760	476760	and we're like, okay, so this is where the tavern's going to go.
476760	477760	This is where the...
477760	478760	The tavern?
478760	480760	Yeah, I got a tavern in my house now.
480760	482760	Okay, so you're going to recreate another tavern.
482760	484760	I don't want to lose shit by moving.
484760	486760	Like, I got a tavern and I got a theater.
486760	488760	I mean, you have a place to...
488760	491760	It's not a real theater. You don't have to freak out.
493760	495760	Or sneeze or whatever you did.
495760	497760	He didn't freak out.
497760	499760	He just went...
499760	501760	No, he sneezed or something.
501760	503760	He's got a luxury allergy. I get it.
504760	505760	I had a hard time cutting.
505760	507760	My immune system started to shut down too
507760	509760	when I realized how fucking rich I was.
509760	511760	So now you're going to have...
511760	512760	Goddamn.
512760	514760	Now you're going to have one master bedroom
514760	517760	and not two separate sanctums.
517760	519760	It'll be one main sanctum.
519760	522760	And is Cody or are you going to have the other bedroom
522760	524760	when you guys are not like...
524760	526760	We each get...
526760	532760	Cody and I each have two bedrooms to...
532760	533760	To choose from.
533760	534760	To play with.
534760	535760	Right.
535760	537760	So we could make one of those...
537760	539760	I could make one in my bedroom.
539760	540760	I could put a bed in it.
540760	542760	I'm not going to do that.
542760	545760	I'm going to put like a green screen in it or something.
545760	547760	I'm going to put a sound booth in there.
547760	548760	I'm going to be like,
548760	550760	She seems to have an invisible touch.
550760	551760	You know?
551760	552760	Right.
552760	553760	I want one.
553760	555760	I'm going to make a panic room.
555760	559760	I just panicked when you wanted to fill Cullen's room.
559760	561760	Here's the thing I'm really going to do.
561760	565760	There's like this rather large closet
565760	568760	that doesn't necessarily...
568760	570760	The layout of the house doesn't indicate
570760	572760	that there should be anything there.
572760	575760	And there was this one house we saw.
575760	577760	It was a really nice house hunting adventure
577760	579760	because we looked at some places where I was like,
579760	581760	This place is fucking rad.
581760	582760	You know?
582760	584760	And then you got to kind of like think,
584760	587760	like does rad mean you want to live here?
587760	588760	Like it's hard to...
588760	590760	I mean, you're looking at a house and you're like,
590760	593760	I always like picture myself in these places
593760	595760	and that it's always ironic.
595760	597760	And then I'm like, do the ironic thing.
597760	600760	Like live for your biopic.
600760	603760	Like have this third act begin.
603760	605760	And it says like 10 years later
605760	609760	and it's like fade in on some shit that makes your mom sick.
609760	613760	Like just makes people shake their head in Wisconsin
613760	615760	and go like, God damn this motherfucker
615760	617760	lives in a giant concrete block
617760	619760	with fucking nude sculptures.
619760	623760	It's overlooking a fucking Malibu infinity pool
623760	627760	and it's a fucking barbecue shaped like a pretzel
627760	630760	because Tim Burton designed it or something.
630760	637760	I looked at a place that had a turntable garage.
637760	639760	It's just like, you just put your Prius on there
639760	642760	and just fucking rotisserie for your Coke parties
642760	645760	and like, check out my fucking Prius, man.
645760	647760	It's just like moving around in a circle.
647760	649760	Why?
649760	653760	I think that was built originally for a choo-choo train.
653760	657760	The alleged purpose would be that you pull into the garage head first
657760	659760	and you don't have to back in and then turn around.
659760	661760	That's fucking crazy.
661760	663760	I mean, it's rad.
663760	665760	But it's not home, you know?
665760	668760	The place that we looked at that was rad.
668760	671760	I think it was Christian Slater who said that.
671760	674760	The walls looked like a place that you would build in no man's sky.
674760	676760	It was like out of wood.
676760	678760	If you've ever played No Man's Sky and you've made a shelter out of wood,
678760	680760	that's what the outside of this place looks like.
680760	682760	You've lost the whole crowd now.
682760	685760	You're talking about video games and buying a giant mansion right now.
685760	687760	I'm trying to get back.
687760	689760	I know I lost them on the mansion.
689760	691760	I'm getting them back with the fucking video game thing.
691760	695760	How big does your house need to be for you to be comfortable?
695760	698760	Is size the important thing here?
698760	700760	You're just you and Cody.
700760	702760	How big does the house need to be?
702760	704760	Size is important to me.
704760	706760	Sorry, I'm picking peanuts out of my teeth.
706760	708760	You also kind of went in a little lift gap right there.
708760	710760	Size is important.
710760	714760	You need room for a Harry to go with your Henderson's.
714760	717760	Get out.
717760	719760	Size is important to me.
719760	721760	I want floor space and elbow room.
721760	723760	Whatever, I got it.
723760	727760	But there was this one place that we looked at,
727760	730760	like the rad place that was not home.
730760	733760	I was like, I would feel fat living here.
733760	738760	This is a place for a person that is on display or something.
738760	741760	It's an interesting radical house.
741760	747760	When you went down the stairs, there was a bookshelf at the bottom of the stairs.
747760	753760	And then the bookshelf was a secret door for a little chamber.
753760	757760	They said a panic room, but if I'm panicked,
757760	761760	I'm not going down half of the stairs.
761760	764760	It's not a panic room.
764760	766760	Where would you go if you were panicked?
766760	768760	I'll get on that later.
768760	770760	But I got inspired by it.
770760	775760	I'm like, that's the only thing that I want in the house that I want.
775760	781760	So I'm going to have a contractor make a bookcase door on this big closet.
781760	786760	And I'm going to put all of the monitors in there for all of the security cameras
786760	790760	so that if I'm having a party, I can be like, Alfred, mind the guests.
790760	794760	And then I go down and I look two ways.
794760	797760	And then I want to make it activated with a book.
797760	801760	You've got to pull a book out and it goes like, click like a Goonies booby trap.
801760	803760	And then it goes open.
803760	807760	And then you just go in there and just watch the perimeter through the monitors.
807760	808760	I wouldn't put cameras in my house.
808760	809760	You can come to a party at my house.
809760	811760	I'm not going to monitor you.
811760	812760	I have my limits.
812760	814760	You've just said that you will.
815760	818760	If you're outside, I'll be watching you because I've got to monitor that perim.
818760	825760	What if you get big paintings of people and you have their eyes be little cameras?
825760	826760	Oh, yeah.
826760	828760	I've got to man my perim.
828760	832760	But once you're in my house, your civil liberties are safe.
832760	833760	I'm not Chuck Berry.
833760	835760	I'm not going to be watching you poo-poo.
835760	838760	You've got to totemans the perims.
838760	841760	Now, let's say you had a library.
841760	844760	The book was the lever that opened up the secret chamber.
844760	845760	Yeah, baby.
845760	849760	Now, obviously, we can't use this one after we say this.
849760	853760	But right now, what title of book would be the one that you would pull?
853760	854760	I think we can use it.
854760	858760	I mean, look, if you come over to my house and you find a bookcase,
858760	860760	you know what's behind there.
860760	864760	And it's not like my suit of art or my actual Batman armors back there.
864760	867760	I'm not a real crime fighter, but it's just fun to be like...
868760	872760	Yeah, I mean, there's two ways to go here.
872760	874760	You've got the Encyclopedia Britannica.
874760	876760	You've got all of Vonnegut.
876760	877760	You've got this.
877760	878760	You've got that.
878760	880760	What is the one that you would pull?
880760	885760	I mean, Fall of the House of Usher, because you're walled in.
885760	889760	What are books about books or doors?
889760	892760	My question is, because it's an interesting thought,
892760	896760	would it be your favorite book or something that was thematic, like you're saying?
896760	898760	You go thematic, you know?
898760	899760	You go thematic.
899760	900760	Yeah.
904760	906760	Don't let the right one in? I don't know.
906760	908760	Yeah, I mean...
908760	910760	A novelization of the Doors movie?
915760	916760	Behind the Green Door?
916760	920760	But you know, I'd go meta and just have the book be like...
920760	923760	I would do every single book fake.
923760	924760	It would be like...
925760	927760	But one book says this is the one you're looking for.
927760	929760	Yeah, one book would be like...
929760	933760	It would be like Tales from the Secret Door knob, you know?
933760	935760	Don't touch this book.
935760	937760	Yeah, that would be the one.
938760	940760	So you're in escrow.
940760	941760	I've never tried to buy a house.
941760	943760	So what does that mean for you right now?
943760	953760	Escrow is a flux period of where the buyer no longer has to bid against other people.
953760	956760	I think bidding is closed, and then it's like...
956760	958760	Was it you versus the bank?
958760	962760	No, it's just a period of time.
962760	969760	It's just like a handshake before the sex, kind of like it's...
969760	977760	There's still time to get out of the deal, mostly on the buyer's side or seller's side.
977760	980760	I just had sex the other night, and the handshake...
981760	984760	It's a pleasure about to do business with you.
988760	993760	For me, on my side, it's a time for me to send over inspectors and stuff.
993760	998760	So you have someone look at the fireplaces, you have someone check out the wiring,
998760	1000760	look for tarantula nests, I don't know.
1000760	1002760	And it's a time to negotiate a little bit.
1002760	1006760	If you find something that's fucked up, like there's a gas leak in this house,
1006760	1009760	you're going to knock off a little of the price because I'm going to fix it
1009760	1012760	when I move in, or are you going to fix it before I move in?
1012760	1016760	But you'll be leaving the neighborhood, you'll be moving to the valley now.
1016760	1019760	Yeah, I wish I could say more, but...
1019760	1022760	It's not like we ever hang out in...
1022760	1026760	You live walking distance from my place, we never hang out.
1026760	1030760	I'll see you as much in the valley villages we do now.
1030760	1033760	I think so. I'll keep my old place,
1033760	1036760	so it'll be like a pied-a-terre overlooking the drawing room.
1036760	1038760	What's that going to be, like a bed and breakfast?
1038760	1040760	I don't know, a pied-a-terre baby.
1040760	1042760	A pied-a-terre, for who?
1042760	1044760	Me, moi!
1044760	1046760	You'll have your own pied-a-terre.
1046760	1051760	No, I'm going to fix it up and then I'll feel out.
1051760	1053760	Could I rent this yearly?
1053760	1057760	What was the desire to leave that place and get a new one?
1057760	1062760	Cody, Cody didn't want to move into a dude's house,
1062760	1067760	she wanted to pick a house with a dude so that we're starting a new chapter together.
1067760	1071760	And it needed to be bigger.
1071760	1074760	Did you have a bubble throat there?
1074760	1076760	Mm-hmm.
1076760	1078760	Yeah.
1078760	1080760	I think I'd still be moving around this time anyway,
1080760	1085760	but I probably would have ended up in a rat house with a fucking carousel garage.
1085760	1088760	I mean, I've talked to people who've bought some of these modern houses.
1088760	1092760	Just have a pool and a back house that I can just squat in whenever I need to swim.
1092760	1095760	My house is like a hotel now.
1095760	1100760	I'm actually actively in the market for a Cato.
1100760	1103760	I may end up having to murder someone.
1103760	1104760	In the same way...
1104760	1106760	No, get a Cato first and then murder somebody.
1106760	1108760	That's exactly what I'm saying.
1108760	1110760	What are you talking about?
1110760	1112760	You get a Cato Caitlin and then you murder somebody.
1112760	1114760	I know!
1114760	1117760	You think I can't help murder somebody?
1117760	1120760	Well, no, Cato didn't help, he was just a witness.
1121760	1122760	He wasn't even a witness.
1122760	1124760	He just happened to be in the back house and he heard a thump on the wall.
1124760	1125760	He heard a thump.
1125760	1126760	It's a witness.
1126760	1127760	Ear witness.
1127760	1128760	I didn't follow the O.J. case.
1128760	1135760	Could have been the thump of corrupt LAPD with a systemic race problem.
1135760	1137760	That's my John Travolta as...
1137760	1139760	What's his name?
1139760	1141760	Oh shit, what's his name?
1141760	1142760	The lawyer.
1142760	1143760	Come on, guys.
1143760	1144760	Robert...
1144760	1145760	Which one?
1145760	1146760	Kardashian.
1146760	1147760	No, the other one.
1147760	1148760	Not the Kardashian.
1148760	1149760	No, that's the black guy.
1149760	1150760	Shapiro.
1150760	1151760	Is he Shapiro?
1151760	1153760	Robert Shapiro, yeah.
1153760	1154760	Travolta was Shapiro.
1154760	1155760	Yeah.
1155760	1156760	Wow.
1156760	1160760	Yeah, a lot of fun performances in that movie.
1160760	1162760	All right.
1162760	1165760	Yeah, retiring from public life.
1165760	1169760	Now, when you have a pool, how much time do you think you, Dan Harmon, are going to spend...
1169760	1171760	I think we've covered this topic.
1171760	1172760	I don't know.
1172760	1173760	All right.
1173760	1176760	Not much was the answer.
1176760	1179760	Not much was the answer.
1179760	1181760	So, Escrow, I lost how long?
1181760	1182760	How long...
1182760	1184760	You might pull the trigger on having this new home.
1184760	1185760	30 days.
1185760	1186760	30 days.
1186760	1187760	Yeah.
1187760	1188760	And then I'm going to...
1188760	1192760	But I'm going to take my sweet time because I love my current house, so I'm going to sit
1192760	1193760	over there.
1193760	1198760	I have people installing right now this crazy electronic system in my old house.
1198760	1200760	They don't even know they're doing it in a...
1200760	1201760	Your old house.
1201760	1202760	You mean the one...
1202760	1203760	Yeah.
1203760	1205760	But I'm auditioning them unawares.
1205760	1208760	Like, I'm like, let's see if you've got the right stuff.
1208760	1212760	Maybe I'll let you wire up my bigger house.
1212760	1215760	I'm just watching them and pretending I live there.
1215760	1217760	I'm like, oh, what if I wanted to play the stereo?
1217760	1223760	Oh, well, you know, then you'd go like this.
1223760	1228760	Or maybe I'd just go over to my other bigger house and listen to music over there, you dumb
1228760	1229760	piece of shit.
1229760	1230760	Get back to work.
1230760	1231760	What happens to your fish?
1231760	1232760	How did the fish get trapped?
1232760	1234760	Oh, that is a tough subject.
1234760	1235760	Because you got fish.
1235760	1236760	Yeah, I got fish.
1236760	1238760	And how do they get moved around?
1238760	1240760	They don't get moved.
1240760	1241760	What?
1241760	1242760	That's a custom...
1242760	1243760	You're going to kill your fish?
1243760	1245760	I'm not going to kill my fish.
1245760	1247760	You're going to have your fish murdered.
1247760	1248760	Cody?
1248760	1249760	Wink.
1249760	1250760	Into the fish tank.
1250760	1254760	It's a custom, like, fucking Bruckheimer fish tank.
1254760	1257760	It is very Michael Mann.
1257760	1260760	It was the fulfillment of a dream I had as a child.
1260760	1263760	I wanted to have a saltwater fish tank.
1263760	1269760	McGathey and I, like, kind of custom designed one for the corner.
1269760	1272760	McGathey, like, built this beautiful tavern in my old house.
1272760	1275760	And part of that was she knew I wanted that fish tank.
1275760	1279760	And it's like, you know, I've now scratched that itch.
1279760	1281760	I'm not a fish tank guy.
1281760	1283760	Are these fish going to die?
1283760	1284760	What's going to happen to these fish?
1284760	1287760	I don't know how it works when you move out and you've got a fish tank.
1287760	1289760	I'm pretty sure it's up to you.
1289760	1292760	I'm pretty sure that you have your finger on that trigger.
1292760	1293760	Well, I don't.
1293760	1294760	Yeah.
1294760	1296760	I mean, I don't know if you just like, but I'm saying, like, I don't know.
1296760	1301760	You just wait for the fish that are in there to die of old age.
1301760	1305760	Like, you just like keep coming back and visiting them and going like, hey,
1305760	1306760	how's it going, Greg?
1306760	1308760	Like, still kicking, huh?
1308760	1310760	Boy, getting pretty empty in there.
1310760	1311760	Yeah, well, we're fish.
1311760	1315760	You know, usually, usually there's a bit more turnover than this.
1315760	1317760	It's just me and the snails now.
1317760	1318760	Yeah.
1318760	1322760	I don't expect you to understand how it works out here, but I moved.
1322760	1324760	Well, there's plenty of water in here.
1324760	1326760	Yeah, I know, but I can't breathe water.
1326760	1328760	How many current alive fish do you have?
1328760	1329760	I don't even know.
1329760	1330760	That's why I know I'm not a fish tank guy.
1330760	1332760	I don't have names.
1332760	1333760	You're a fish murderer.
1333760	1336760	You might as well be like on Deadliest Catch.
1336760	1338760	I'm a fish murderer the same way I am.
1338760	1339760	Yeah.
1339760	1342760	I'm a cow murderer when I buy, because I'm not vegan.
1342760	1346760	I mean, which is a lot because I'm not, I'm supporting a marketplace that,
1347760	1351760	like I, by buying fish and putting them on display in my house,
1351760	1354760	I incentivized a marketplace that, you know,
1354760	1356760	someone out there is catching and breeding fish that are.
1356760	1358760	Yeah, but you, you, you.
1358760	1360760	I'm not going to kill these fish.
1360760	1363760	These fish are fucking as happy as you can get in a tank.
1363760	1365760	There's no way to transport these fish into your new place.
1365760	1367760	Are you saying you're done with these fish?
1367760	1369760	Yeah, I'm not a fish tank guy.
1369760	1373760	Which means you're, you're a fish murderer.
1373760	1375760	Like these fish can go.
1375760	1377760	I think you're projecting a lot in there.
1377760	1379760	Could you send these fish to a better home is what I mean.
1379760	1380760	Like, can these fish go live?
1380760	1381760	Yeah, I'm sure you can, yeah.
1381760	1382760	Okay.
1382760	1384760	Do you think I'm going to like put them in a net
1384760	1386760	and whip them across the yard or something?
1389760	1392760	That would be harder than leaving them where they're alive.
1392760	1396760	But how hard, it seems very hard to find a home for fish.
1396760	1397760	I know.
1399760	1400760	Nextdoor app, yeah.
1400760	1405760	I could, I can check in with these maniacs that are, yeah,
1405760	1407760	I should check back in on that.
1407760	1412760	I wonder if Rebecca ever got her secondhand bark collar so that
1412760	1416760	she could try one out without expending too much on her mission
1416760	1418760	to make her dog not bark.
1418760	1419760	God damn it.
1419760	1421760	Who was that guy that was on her case?
1421760	1425760	It was like, your dog is barking because he's psychologically scarred.
1426760	1429760	And then everyone else was like, give them pills.
1429760	1430760	I got pills.
1430760	1431760	Come over and get some pills.
1431760	1433760	Oh, I'd love to try those pills.
1433760	1434760	You're all insane.
1434760	1437760	You need to socialize your dogs.
1437760	1438760	Shut up, Greg.
1439760	1441760	Greg's the name of the fish too, I know.
1441760	1442760	Right, yeah.
1442760	1444760	I'm not good at making up names.
1447760	1449760	So the fish will find the home.
1449760	1452760	The fish will, the fish, if I do nothing,
1452760	1455760	which is what I've done as a fish, I want her heretofore,
1455760	1457760	like the fish stay alive.
1458760	1462760	Among the things I don't do is tell the person that feeds
1462760	1464760	the fish to not feed them.
1464760	1469760	I mean, I have default mechanisms that ensure a healthy,
1469760	1473760	luxurious life for these fish in their little tank.
1473760	1476760	But I don't know what I'm, you know,
1476760	1478760	I'm going to have to find homes for them, I guess.
1478760	1481760	There's a little prawn in there, a couple prawns.
1482760	1483760	Adorable.
1483760	1484760	Always wanted a prawn.
1484760	1486760	Then I got one and I was like, boring.
1488760	1490760	Looks like a shrimp hanging out.
1490760	1491760	It was just when I was a kid.
1491760	1492760	A prawn is a shrimp.
1492760	1494760	When I was a kid, we had a freshwater tank.
1494760	1495760	It looks like a shrimp.
1495760	1498760	And like, we would go to the tropical fish store.
1498760	1500760	My mom was like into keeping a fish tank.
1500760	1501760	I had a placostomus.
1501760	1504760	I had like various things and I was more into it then.
1504760	1505760	My mom was into it.
1505760	1508760	And we'd go to the tropical fish store and then there was
1508760	1509760	the saltwater section.
1509760	1512760	And it was like, that's where all the cool fish were.
1512760	1514760	Like, whoa, this thing looks like a spider.
1514760	1516760	And my mom would go, those are for rich people.
1516760	1518760	I was like, those are hard to maintain.
1518760	1519760	They're expensive.
1519760	1520760	All this stuff.
1520760	1527760	And so just as surely as I, whenever I buy peanut butter on Amazon,
1527760	1532760	I will sort by price descending and pick the top one because fuck
1532760	1533760	everyone that ever.
1533760	1535760	You buy your peanut butter on Amazon?
1535760	1536760	Price descending.
1538760	1541760	If someone out there comes out with a $50 jar of peanut butter,
1541760	1543760	I'll be their only customer.
1543760	1547760	I blindly, like I sort things by price descending and click the top one
1547760	1550760	because I'm just like, never again, man.
1551760	1552760	Never deprived.
1552760	1555760	So you don't just go roll down to the Gelsons and scoop up
1555760	1556760	some peanut butter there.
1556760	1557760	Oh, yeah.
1557760	1558760	No, I love going down to the Gelsons.
1558760	1560760	The fuck are you talking about?
1561760	1563760	You think I want poor germs?
1563760	1564760	The fuck?
1565760	1566760	You become a monster.
1567760	1570760	You don't enjoy walking down to the market and rolling around
1570760	1573760	the produce section and go, oh, this apple looks pretty groovy.
1573760	1574760	Oh, yeah, it's great.
1574760	1575760	Yeah, I love that.
1575760	1577760	I've always loved strangers.
1578760	1580760	They're great, great people.
1580760	1581760	I love their babies.
1581760	1585760	I love it when strangers have babies, take them out in public,
1585760	1587760	and it's my problem.
1587760	1588760	I love that.
1588760	1593760	I love almost stepping on some urchin's head and getting a shit look
1593760	1595760	from their terrible parent.
1595760	1600760	Like, why is your baby rolling in dirt in public?
1601760	1603760	I should have stepped on it.
1604760	1606760	I should have stepped on your baby.
1607760	1611760	But I can't, because then you'd be like, you'd Google me and be like,
1611760	1612760	jackpot.
1612760	1615760	People probably put babies in front of me on purpose.
1616760	1620760	I was at a Target once, and I kicked a baby.
1620760	1622760	It was rolling around.
1622760	1625760	You know those days in Target when there's like a sale,
1625760	1627760	and it just looks like a fucking war zone?
1627760	1630760	You walk in there and go, what the fuck happened to Target?
1630760	1631760	What is it?
1631760	1632760	What are we in?
1632760	1633760	Fucking Beirut?
1633760	1634760	Sorry to Beirut.
1634760	1636760	It's the Paris of the Mideast.
1639760	1642760	But it was like, I kicked a fucking baby.
1642760	1645760	It was like rolling around in the clothes.
1645760	1647760	It was like, what is a baby?
1647760	1649760	It just looks like a bunch of clothes.
1649760	1651760	It's a Target covered in clothes.
1651760	1654760	Everyone's just like, I can't believe people go in there and go,
1654760	1656760	oh, there's a sale at Target.
1656760	1657760	What's this, $3?
1657760	1658760	Nah, I don't need that.
1658760	1659760	Drop.
1659760	1662760	They just drop it on the floor.
1662760	1663760	It's insanity.
1663760	1664760	Oh, so you've been to a Target.
1664760	1665760	I've been to a Target.
1665760	1667760	This is like 20 years ago.
1667760	1668760	Oh, God.
1668760	1672760	When I was like, I had the idea I was going to buy five of the same shirt,
1672760	1674760	I'm like, okay, I'll go to a Target.
1674760	1675760	It was like a war zone.
1675760	1678760	And then I'm like looking around, I'm like, let me just find some shirts.
1678760	1685760	And then it was like, I kicked this like wet, mushy thing.
1685760	1686760	I thought you were joking.
1686760	1688760	You actually kicked a baby.
1688760	1689760	Yeah.
1689760	1690760	A human child.
1690760	1691760	Yes, I kicked a baby.
1691760	1693760	I thought you were doing a bit.
1693760	1695760	So this child actually rolls around the floor.
1695760	1699760	Yeah, it was rolling around in the dirty floor clothes.
1699760	1700760	Yes.
1700760	1706760	It was like playing a game called bet you think that I'm close and walk on me.
1706760	1710760	And the mom was just too busy throwing shirts on the floor to like,
1710760	1712760	and I'm like, I kicked the kid.
1712760	1714760	And I was like, oh shit.
1714760	1715760	You know?
1715760	1717760	And the kid was like, ah.
1717760	1724760	And the mom looked at me like she gave me this look.
1724760	1725760	Oh, yeah.
1725760	1726760	Yeah.
1726760	1727760	I know the look.
1727760	1728760	We all know the look.
1728760	1729760	Why he kicked my baby.
1729760	1730760	Yeah.
1730760	1731760	You fucking, oh, you baby kicker.
1731760	1732760	And I was like, I gave her this look.
1732760	1742760	I was like, it's like, do you mean like, come on, case or ass arise the look I gave her.
1742760	1743760	Say la vie.
1743760	1744760	Okay.
1744760	1753760	Like how many languages, you know, like fucking your baby going to get stepped on.
1754760	1767760	Like, man, you know, when I was in public with my mom, she would, she was like, this is not your house.
1767760	1770760	She would, you know, she was like, you go to a movie theater.
1770760	1775760	If you're like, you're watching a movie and then you're like, mom, how come the jabberwockies?
1775760	1777760	She's like, shut the fuck up.
1777760	1779760	What are you, they're not your living room.
1779760	1780760	Jesus Christ.
1780760	1781760	There's all these people here.
1781760	1782760	God damn.
1782760	1783760	She's right.
1783760	1789760	You know, it's important to be shamed about public behavior.
1789760	1794760	I have a little bit of anxiety, but like, I'm, I'm a better person for it.
1794760	1801760	I think like, you know, I was like, my mom would say, what if everyone here did what you just did?
1801760	1802760	How would that work for you?
1802760	1804760	Would you, is that the world you want to live in?
1804760	1806760	Oh God, no, that's gross.
1806760	1807760	What is that?
1807760	1809760	I don't want to live in booger world.
1809760	1811760	She was a good mom in that sense.
1811760	1814760	I mean, she really knew how to lay down the suppressive fire.
1814760	1816760	What was the aftermath of you kicking the baby?
1816760	1817760	Like, was everything turn out okay?
1817760	1821760	It was just kind of, yeah, it was like a flashing headlights at each other.
1821760	1823760	I was like, it's like, you kick my baby.
1823760	1826760	I'm like, your baby, your baby's laying in dirt.
1826760	1829760	I didn't, we didn't set it with our eyes, you know?
1829760	1831760	And then she just like called the baby's name.
1831760	1833760	And she was like, I don't know.
1833760	1834760	I don't know.
1834760	1836760	She set it with our eyes, you know?
1836760	1839760	And then she just like called the baby's name and had it, had it like,
1839760	1843760	you know, you know, squirm over to her.
1843760	1845760	Squirm.
1845760	1847760	A little larva.
1847760	1849760	Like an infant, like under a year old.
1849760	1851760	Yeah, it was old enough to know better.
1851760	1855760	Like it wasn't like a baby, like, like a helpless baby.
1855760	1857760	Like it was like, it had.
1857760	1858760	A baby of means.
1858760	1860760	It had, it had motility.
1860760	1862760	It had like it's decision-making.
1862760	1866760	Like, I think I'm going to go over there, roll around on the floor.
1866760	1867760	Now that's not the baby's.
1867760	1871760	But you are so excited about shirts, Five of Peace, that you are walking around.
1871760	1872760	So excited.
1872760	1873760	Willy nilly.
1873760	1875760	And just like, don't even watch yourself.
1875760	1876760	I was walking.
1876760	1878760	No situational awareness at all.
1878760	1879760	That's it.
1879760	1881760	There was no excitement.
1881760	1883760	Yeah, I wasn't looking for babies.
1883760	1885760	That's, yeah, you're right about that.
1885760	1887760	I was walking.
1887760	1888760	Yeah.
1888760	1889760	Yeah.
1889760	1892760	I was looking for shirts, babies beware.
1892760	1893760	Yeah.
1893760	1895760	No, it's stupid that there's babies on the ground.
1895760	1896760	I agree with that.
1896760	1900760	Well, I mean, you're kind of taking her side.
1900760	1901760	I'm taking your side.
1901760	1902760	I mean, you're a contrarian.
1902760	1903760	I'm taking your side.
1903760	1905760	I'm saying like, why leave a baby on the ground?
1905760	1906760	You're coming around.
1906760	1907760	You're going to get walked on.
1907760	1908760	There was the initial round.
1908760	1909760	I mean, you're always challenging me.
1909760	1911760	You're like, oh, Dan's a piece of shit.
1911760	1912760	Let's find out why.
1912760	1914760	Like that's what the show is now.
1914760	1915760	That's fine.
1915760	1916760	I get it.
1916760	1917760	That's what the show has always been, Dan.
1917760	1919760	There was a time when it was like, oh, I'm sharing my life.
1919760	1921760	And you're helping me stay on track.
1921760	1924760	And now it's like, I just now I'm not sharing my life.
1924760	1925760	I'm like hiding.
1925760	1927760	And I'm like, oh no, I ate a hot dog yesterday.
1927760	1929760	And you're like, you ate a hot dog.
1929760	1931760	Prove it.
1931760	1932760	I'm like, I don't know.
1932760	1933760	It was a thing between buns.
1933760	1935760	Define buns.
1935760	1936760	I don't know.
1936760	1937760	Like two pieces of bread.
1937760	1938760	What's your favorite bread?
1938760	1940760	Name three breads.
1940760	1941760	I don't know, Jeff.
1941760	1942760	Whole wheat, like whole grain.
1942760	1943760	Whole grain?
1943760	1944760	Whole grain?
1945760	1947760	And I can't be like, can I get back to what I was talking about?
1947760	1949760	Because what I was talking about is I hate doing the show.
1949760	1951760	And I wish I was dead.
1951760	1953760	I don't want that conversation to finish.
1953760	1955760	No, I'm actually very happy.
1955760	1956760	I hate doing the show.
1956760	1958760	I'm very happy.
1958760	1961760	I got a new MacBook today.
1961760	1962760	Thanks, Spencer.
1962760	1965760	No problem, man.
1965760	1968760	It doesn't have the little thing.
1969760	1971760	It doesn't have that strip.
1971760	1972760	Yeah, do you want that?
1972760	1974760	We could take it back.
1974760	1975760	What is that strip?
1975760	1976760	What does it mean?
1976760	1978760	It's got F keys on it.
1978760	1980760	You know, like the F1 and the F2?
1980760	1981760	It's got like that.
1981760	1984760	And I think sometimes it has emojis.
1984760	1986760	On the keyboard itself?
1986760	1988760	On the little bar.
1988760	1989760	Why is it different?
1989760	1992760	Why is that a thing that's on some keyboard?
1992760	1994760	On the keyboard itself?
1994760	1995760	On the little bar.
1995760	1996760	Why is it different?
1996760	1999760	Why is that a thing that's on some MacBooks and not others?
1999760	2001760	I think it's just on the top model.
2001760	2003760	For both the 13 inch and the 15 inch.
2003760	2004760	Top model?
2004760	2005760	Yeah.
2005760	2007760	I didn't get the top model?
2007760	2008760	No.
2008760	2009760	We could do that.
2009760	2011760	It's $300 more.
2011760	2013760	This is America's top model?
2017760	2018760	Dan.
2018760	2019760	Dad.
2019760	2020760	Dan.
2020760	2021760	Dad.
2022760	2024760	Oh, is that what this is?
2024760	2025760	Am I your dad now?
2025760	2026760	Cody ordered me a shirt.
2026760	2029760	I will take my belt off right now, Dan.
2029760	2034760	Cody ordered me a shirt that's all wear when it came in tonight.
2034760	2038760	But there was a shirt online that says dad jokes.
2038760	2040760	I think you mean rad jokes.
2040760	2044760	But the thing is, the photo of the shirt, like the advertisement for it,
2044760	2046760	it's a picture of a shirt.
2046760	2052760	And then there's like two converse all stars kind of like coming in frame
2052760	2057760	like laying on the corner of the shirt just to make it more rad, the shirt.
2057760	2063760	And I was like, well, I want the shirt, but I want the tennis shoes like in there too.
2063760	2065760	Like I want the whole shirt on a shirt.
2065760	2070760	So she ordered the shirt and the shirt's got a picture of a shirt on it with shoes on it.
2070760	2072760	And the shirt says dad jokes.
2072760	2073760	I think you mean rad jokes.
2073760	2075760	It's a confusing shirt.
2076760	2077760	Can you show me?
2077760	2080760	We can't show the whole audience, but I'd like to see this.
2080760	2082760	Okay, okay.
2082760	2084760	It feels like a courtroom.
2084760	2085760	Yes.
2085760	2087760	Show the bailiff.
2087760	2089760	Dad jokes.
2089760	2090760	Oh, that's nice.
2090760	2093760	Like it's a shirt with a picture of a shirt on it, right?
2093760	2094760	Yeah.
2094760	2095760	Yeah.
2095760	2097760	Yeah, it's a shirt with a picture of a shirt on it.
2097760	2098760	It's like a hat on a hat.
2098760	2101760	It's a shirt on a shirt.
2101760	2105760	It's a shoe on a shirt on a shirt.
2105760	2107760	Well, there's no guest tonight, by the way.
2107760	2110760	What do you think Colin Hanks is going to come out and make it worth your time?
2110760	2111760	No.
2111760	2112760	This is all you get.
2112760	2113760	No.
2113760	2114760	So and so.
2114760	2119760	Well, I think we should do is try to really get back on track on D&D.
2119760	2125760	And Spencer, I think tonight brought, he brought the character sheets and the whole flim flam,
2125760	2126760	right?
2126760	2127760	Yeah.
2127760	2129760	You got dice of your own and we don't have to go out to the crowd.
2129760	2130760	Yeah.
2130760	2136760	I say we really, Dan, you, me, Spencer gets really like figure out where we are.
2136760	2140760	Remember what was going on and then begin again afresh.
2140760	2141760	Yeah.
2141760	2143760	Why did I get a new MacBook Pro?
2143760	2144760	You're asking.
2144760	2147760	Dan, don't you have like 90 laptops?
2147760	2148760	What?
2148760	2150760	Dan, I have a question for you.
2150760	2151760	Yeah.
2151760	2153760	Why did you get a new MacBook Pro?
2153760	2156760	Because I've been trying, I've been making music on my iPad Pro.
2156760	2163760	I took Apple at face value when they said you can now produce music on this iPad Pro.
2163760	2166760	It has a USB-C port in it.
2166760	2168760	That opens you up to limitless possibilities.
2168760	2171760	I was like, okay, I'm going to get on the board with this.
2171760	2174760	I follow Henny the business on YouTube.
2174760	2179760	He's into the iPad Pro and he's written music for Drake or something.
2179760	2182760	And he's like, people are going to be making music with the iPad Pro.
2182760	2184760	I'm like, he's Henny the business.
2184760	2186760	He does tutorials and stuff.
2186760	2192760	So all this time last year or so, I've been learning all these apps and things,
2192760	2196760	spending all this money, USB cables and things.
2196760	2198760	They're all buggy.
2198760	2202760	Here's the only program that works on the iPad Pro for making music, GarageBand.
2202760	2205760	That's it, without crashing, without having some fatal bug.
2205760	2208760	All the other ones are just like these weird experimental things.
2208760	2210760	They have different bugs.
2210760	2213760	If you don't want the bug that's in Cubasis 2, you can use Oreo Pro.
2213760	2216760	But you've got a different bug.
2216760	2220760	You can't have bugs that are just like, oh, shit.
2220760	2225760	If you work for an hour on the song, this shit happens that makes it all weird.
2225760	2227760	That's not acceptable.
2227760	2229760	So I was like, we're not ready for this.
2229760	2231760	It's like VR technology.
2231760	2233760	We keep pretending like we want to be in the future.
2233760	2236760	And it's like, oh, you're going to be making music on your iPad Pro.
2236760	2237760	No, you're not.
2237760	2239760	It's a fucking giant iPhone.
2239760	2241760	Get your shit together, Apple.
2241760	2244760	Suck my titty.
2244760	2249760	I guess they announced a new iOS for iPads today.
2249760	2252760	So two steps forward, one step back.
2252760	2254760	There already was an iPad iOS.
2254760	2257760	And then they merged it with the fucking iPhone iOS.
2257760	2259760	And now it's like, oh, no, you need a special iPad iOS.
2259760	2260760	Yeah, why?
2260760	2263760	Because you think if you're holding a big giant fucking thing in your hands,
2263760	2268760	you might want it to work like a goddamn laptop, you fucking Apple turds.
2268760	2269760	So I just got a laptop.
2269760	2270760	I'm like, what am I doing?
2270760	2272760	I'm sitting in bed in my pajamas.
2272760	2276760	I'm trying to make music.
2276760	2279760	Laptop weighs the same and is apparently the only thing that's not going to crash
2279760	2280760	every time.
2280760	2284760	Like Logic Pro seems really cool.
2284760	2289760	So I'm going to be making even better music now, Jeff.
2289760	2294760	I've been enjoying your Instagram little music nuggets.
2294760	2299760	And I want to wire my car for audio so that I can...
2299760	2302760	It's just awful, singing in the car.
2302760	2307760	And then you bring it home and you're trying to EQ out the car sound
2307760	2310760	and it's just bad.
2310760	2312760	I keep trying, I keep getting all these different mics.
2312760	2314760	I got a lav mic and put it on my seat belt.
2314760	2315760	For real?
2315760	2316760	Yeah.
2316760	2317760	And it didn't work.
2317760	2321760	You can probably get one in your headliner up here, above you.
2321760	2325760	I mean, lav mics won't work because lav mics have this reaction
2325760	2329760	to the background sound of the car that's actually even worse
2329760	2331760	than the built-in mic on the iPhone.
2331760	2335760	As soon as you start driving in the car, there's sound from outside,
2335760	2338760	the lav mics go fucking insane.
2338760	2340760	They think that you're dragging it down a gravel path
2340760	2342760	and it blows out all of the audio.
2342760	2345760	So you need a hardwired mic in your car.
2345760	2346760	Yeah, I need special...
2346760	2350760	I need to get shotgun mics that are special and point them at my head.
2350760	2352760	I bet if you got on the phone...
2352760	2353760	Do that again?
2353760	2354760	Hmm?
2354760	2357760	Yeah, I need to get special shotgun mics.
2357760	2359760	You need one over here and one over here.
2359760	2360760	Yeah.
2360760	2363760	I bet if you called like a Sweetwater
2363760	2365760	or the Sam Asher, the people like that, they would...
2365760	2366760	Are you okay?
2366760	2367760	Yeah.
2367760	2368760	Don't die.
2368760	2371760	Oh, no, no, that's not how I'm going to die.
2371760	2372760	How...
2372760	2374760	Were you coughing at the mention of Sweetwater?
2374760	2375760	Yeah.
2375760	2378760	Well, I'm coughing at the mention of working with audio people.
2378760	2380760	No offense to our audio people.
2382760	2383760	I just...
2383760	2386760	I mean, I know that is the solution, but it's just like...
2386760	2389760	Yeah, but they would sort that out for you, like straight off the bat.
2389760	2394760	It's just hard because the vibration translates like through the whole frame of the car, so...
2394760	2398760	They don't go into audio because their personalities are wonderful.
2398760	2400760	I hope our audio people didn't hear that.
2400760	2404760	What are some jobs that you go into because your personalities are wonderful?
2404760	2405760	Like an actor.
2406760	2410760	You know, I wish my car needed acting.
2411760	2413760	I called Joel McHale.
2414760	2418760	I've had him in my car, it makes the car better at acting.
2418760	2419760	It's great.
2419760	2420760	Actors are great.
2420760	2421760	Very pleasant people.
2421760	2423760	Technically psychotic.
2423760	2426760	I mean, their job is to pretend cameras aren't there.
2426760	2428760	It takes a little bit of a...
2428760	2431760	But I mean, they don't make that your problem.
2431760	2432760	They're performers.
2432760	2434760	Yeah, I don't trust that actors are good people.
2434760	2436760	I just trust that they're being good at acting.
2436760	2439760	Right, their personalities are great.
2439760	2441760	Well, their acted personalities are.
2441760	2445760	Yeah, their front-facing personalities.
2445760	2447760	The part that you have to touch.
2447760	2448760	Right.
2448760	2449760	Yeah, it's great.
2449760	2452760	It doesn't have audio guys sweat on it.
2453760	2456760	But you're going to suffer now by not having...
2456760	2457760	You're going to have to try...
2457760	2461760	We're going to suffer because our audio guys are going to put fart sounds all over the rest of the show.
2461760	2464760	Slurpy, slurp, slurp sounds.
2464760	2466760	But that would be pretty cool to trick out your car with mics,
2466760	2469760	so you could just have always a camera on you
2469760	2472760	and always have mics on you that you could just do whatever you wanted.
2472760	2475760	Yeah, I want to take that on as a little hobby.
2475760	2478760	Get excited about the technical application of it.
2478760	2481760	Because I find that when I get into just the...
2481760	2485760	By the time I get that figured out, that's when I start to...
2485760	2487760	I lose interest in the creative.
2487760	2490760	Why don't you call up the people that do cash cab or something like that?
2491760	2493760	You know, I do.
2493760	2496760	I think there's people I could bring into it.
2496760	2498760	I just kind of...
2498760	2500760	Why don't you do cash cab?
2500760	2503760	Yeah, once you get it all figured out, you can just do cash cab.
2503760	2506760	I think cash cab doesn't drive very fast.
2506760	2510760	So once you hit a certain speed, it kind of changes the nature of the vibration.
2510760	2512760	Yeah, because in New York, you never go anywhere.
2512760	2514760	You're stuck at a stoplight the entire time.
2514760	2519760	I guess part of the reason I don't immediately ask for outside help
2519760	2522760	is because I really love going to Fry's Electronics.
2522760	2523760	There you are.
2523760	2524760	I just love to spend a weekend there.
2524760	2528760	But when you go into Fry's, do you like finding a clerk there and saying,
2528760	2530760	hey, I know, I did love that it's a wasteland now.
2530760	2535760	I love that it's like the internet has turned Fry's into just this weird ghost town.
2535760	2539760	So you're just freestyling in there and just saying, I think this is what's going to work.
2539760	2544760	I just wander down aisles and go, oh, that looks like it's shaped like a metal thing.
2544760	2546760	And you never see a clerk and go, hey, buddy, come over here.
2546760	2551760	If you see a clerk, they nervously dart into a back room with a box that they were taping up.
2551760	2557760	Their job is to Windex the plexiglass that has all of the shit locked down
2557760	2559760	that could be stolen and valuable.
2559760	2567760	And then the only people there are people that need shit that you can get faster
2567760	2571760	by driving down to Fry's than you can on Amazon, which is up in that clip or something.
2571760	2575760	When you had your fish tank angularly fixed into the wall of your place,
2575760	2577760	you didn't just go freestyle.
2577760	2579760	You had somebody on the phone.
2579760	2581760	Was that Aaron doing that?
2581760	2585760	At some point, you've reached out to strangers and said, I need help with this.
2585760	2587760	Let's make this great.
2587760	2594760	Oh, you mean the ongoing eight-year process of trying to make my house able to play a Phil Collins song
2594760	2596760	when I want to hear one?
2596760	2604760	Yeah, that $1.2 million project consisting of team after team of fucking professionals
2604760	2607760	coming in for consultations and then ripping the walls apart
2607760	2614760	and putting more fucking ethernet cable throughout it and asking me more questions
2614760	2619760	and only to tell me that what I want doesn't work with whatever the fuck.
2619760	2625760	Yeah, that little hobby, yeah, not satisfying, which is why maybe that's part of
2625760	2627760	you're making me realize.
2627760	2632760	Maybe it's a recourse to my self-esteem and masculinity
2632760	2637760	or something that I want to wire my car for sound and have control over.
2637760	2641760	I would literally put a little mixer on my dashboard or something.
2641760	2643760	Just don't kill yourself in your car.
2643760	2647760	Make sure that your eyes are on the road while you're doing all this.
2647760	2650760	You've expressed that and I find that adorable.
2650760	2653760	Every time I watch your videos, I love them and they're hilarious,
2653760	2655760	but I was like, oh, don't die on camera.
2655760	2659760	But then you wouldn't have died on camera because you go back and edit them and put lyrics on them.
2660760	2666760	But when I tell you that, of course I'm driving carefully, you're like,
2666760	2668760	yeah, but your eyes are darting all around.
2668760	2670760	I'm like, you're watching me drive defensively.
2670760	2672760	I've never been in a car wreck.
2672760	2674760	I'm a defensive driver.
2674760	2678760	When I'm singing, you can see me being like...
2679760	2683760	I have my own hangups about people, like worrying about people getting in car wrecks.
2683760	2684760	So that's my own thing.
2684760	2688760	I wish I was so good at singing that I could lose myself in it enough to have a car accident.
2688760	2691760	That's Celine Dion you're thinking of.
2691760	2696760	I'm not going to be like, close my eyes, like Mariah Carey or something.
2696760	2698760	I'm gesturing the notes.
2698760	2700760	Have you seen that thing?
2700760	2703760	What's the fucking late night show host that I don't know?
2703760	2705760	He had Celine Dion in his car.
2705760	2706760	James Corden.
2706760	2707760	Yeah.
2707760	2713760	And he brought Celine Dion in his car and they just did karaoke in his car.
2713760	2714760	It's great.
2714760	2715760	It's really good.
2715760	2717760	And then the whole time I'm worried that they're going to die.
2717760	2720760	So you can wire a car for sound is what I'm hearing.
2720760	2721760	Yeah.
2721760	2722760	I just got to figure it out.
2722760	2726760	They probably had a guy laying down in the back seat like with a boom mic and shit.
2726760	2730760	That's how I've performed in cars.
2730760	2732760	There was always a boom guy in the back seat for real.
2732760	2733760	Yeah.
2733760	2736760	They probably had a sound mixer like laying down in the back.
2738760	2740760	I saw a guy at YouTube video.
2740760	2743760	He was like, oh, here's how you podcast in your car.
2743760	2746760	And he had like a preamp that he recommended and lav mics.
2746760	2749760	He said, you put the lav mic on your seat belt, but I thought I got everything that
2749760	2752760	he recommended and it sounded like shit.
2752760	2753760	I don't know if he me.
2753760	2754760	I don't know.
2754760	2756760	Like the thing might be you can't get on the freeway or something.
2756760	2757760	It definitely helps.
2757760	2761760	I podcasted in my car too, but, uh, the freeway, the faster you go when you hit,
2761760	2763760	say 35, uh, it gets worse.
2763760	2765760	45 is a lot worse.
2765760	2767760	And then there's different kinds of consistencies of roads.
2767760	2770760	So like some roads when I get on, it gets all fucked up.
2770760	2772760	But if I stick to other ones, it's fine.
2772760	2777760	I'm surprised that sound doesn't work like green like video and that you
2777760	2783760	could just say, Hey, here's a, here's a sampling of the sound of my car on the
2783760	2784760	freeway.
2784760	2787760	Remove that from this audio.
2787760	2790760	You can, I don't think it's perfect, but you could definitely do that.
2790760	2791760	It definitely helps.
2791760	2795760	It's because it'll take, it'll, there's a part of me saying the word pickle.
2795760	2800760	That's also using the same part of the audio spectrum as like the sound of the
2800760	2801760	freeway.
2801760	2806760	And so it'll, it'll, you can't do it without me sounding like pick, you know,
2806760	2809760	like you're removing freeway sounds from my throat.
2809760	2811760	There's all sorts of like in betweens though.
2811760	2813760	Like you can definitely get it like better.
2813760	2818760	And then there's also just like, uh, the better, uh, audio apps have just a way
2818760	2821760	to remove sounds below a certain threshold.
2821760	2825760	So like when you're talking or something or when you're not talking, if it's too
2825760	2826760	quiet, you just won't hear that.
2826760	2829760	So if it's like a low road, sand, it'll just be gone.
2829760	2832760	Something kind of satisfying about the, the pursuit of sound.
2832760	2833760	Oh yeah, it's great.
2833760	2836760	I mean, I love sound sounds so cool and it's like, it's different.
2836760	2837760	I don't know.
2837760	2840760	Video editing is probably the same, but I just like audio editing.
2840760	2841760	It feels so powerful.
2841760	2844760	You can just really get your hands on it and like rip it apart and do stuff to
2844760	2845760	it.
2845760	2846760	And I don't even know what I'm doing.
2846760	2851760	Such a thing as perfect silence and you know, yeah, just like ways to like
2851760	2856760	optimize and it, but it's like beyond working in black and white.
2856760	2861760	It's like, you're just working in sound and it's like, it's like, oh, I think
2861760	2866760	I can see the appeal of that where you're like, I could control this world.
2866760	2869760	I want to do, I want to do sound, sound design and stuff.
2869760	2870760	That could be cool.
2870760	2871760	Yeah.
2871760	2874760	Hey, you want to, uh, you want to, you want to, you want me to give you a
2874760	2876760	little starting library of stuff.
2876760	2877760	Sure.
2877760	2879760	This is a champagne cork.
2879760	2881760	Holy shit.
2881760	2885760	Uh, here's a, here's a, here's a window opening.
2886760	2891760	Um, old, old timey, uh, choo-choo train starting up.
2906760	2907760	That's very good.
2907760	2908760	Yeah. Thank you.
2908760	2911760	Uh, uh, the, uh, the, the battle of Stalingrad.
2912760	2913760	Oh.
2927760	2928760	Wow.
2928760	2930760	There's a German guy in there.
2930760	2931760	German submariner.
2931760	2932760	They were fighting.
2932760	2933760	They were fighting the Germans.
2933760	2934760	Yeah.
2934760	2939760	If someone lost their boot or found one of their, that boot, that particular
2939760	2940760	boot.
2940760	2942760	That's the, that's the weirdest part of that movie.
2942760	2946760	Das boot is when the guy, you know, just looked at the camera and says,
2946760	2947760	Das boot.
2948760	2949760	He doesn't do that.
2951760	2955760	Uh, how, how about, uh, can I give you more sound ideas?
2955760	2956760	Mm-hmm.
2960760	2963760	You want like a scary haunted house, probably just for just general
2963760	2965760	purpose haunted house atmosphere.
2965760	2966760	Okay.
2971760	2973760	Blah, blah, blah.
2973760	2979760	Ooh, boo, blah, blah, boo, boo, blah, blah.
2982760	2983760	There's a cowboy in there.
2983760	2984760	Okay.
2984760	2986760	Fighting both the Dracula and the ghosts.
2986760	2988760	Give, give me a.
2988760	2990760	If you're Dracula and your ghost start fighting each other,
2990760	2992760	just put a cowboy in your haunted house.
2992760	2994760	He'll still sort shit out fast.
2994760	2999760	Give me Count Dracula waking up and realizing he needs a shave and shaving.
2999760	3001760	So this is Count Dracula having a morning shave.
3001760	3003760	Count Dracula waking up, seeing he needs a morning shave.
3003760	3004760	Yes.
3006760	3007760	Yeah.
3007760	3008760	Well, first of all,
3010760	3011760	I tried.
3012760	3014760	You tried to trick Dracula into killing himself.
3014760	3015760	Right.
3015760	3017760	Whatever morning means to.
3017760	3018760	Okay.
3018760	3019760	Midnight.
3019760	3021760	I think it could be the opposite of cockadoodle do.
3021760	3023760	It's midnight when the strip is hot.
3023760	3024760	That's when Dracula gets out.
3024760	3025760	Yeah.
3029760	3050760	Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3050760	3053760	That last part was him going like, I don't have any blood.
3053760	3054760	Okay.
3054760	3058760	So I cut myself shaving BFD big fucking Dracula.
3058760	3060760	He's full of blood after a good night's sleep.
3060760	3062760	He'd be, he'd be all, he'd be hungry.
3062760	3063760	What?
3063760	3065760	He wakes up at midnight.
3065760	3066760	Hungry for blood.
3066760	3067760	Yeah.
3067760	3069760	It's why it's half of the reason he's waking up.
3069760	3070760	Right.
3070760	3071760	Yeah.
3071760	3072760	So that's a breath for breakfast.
3072760	3074760	He's like, I just, I just bled an egg McMuffin.
3074760	3076760	Now I'm, I'm hungrier than I used to be.
3076760	3078760	Oh, well I'm not, but I mean, I'm saying like,
3078760	3080760	I don't even think anything comes out.
3080760	3084760	I think whatever he got the previous night by sun up spiders.
3084760	3085760	The spiders come out.
3085760	3086760	Oh, spiders come out.
3086760	3087760	Okay.
3087760	3090760	Well, I mean, look, you're free to interpret.
3090760	3102760	Let's say, uh, let's say, uh, Robert De Niro is, uh,
3102760	3107760	is having a bad time in the backseat of an Uber.
3107760	3108760	Okay.
3117760	3118760	For Robert.
3122760	3123760	Yes.
3132760	3135760	You going, uh, museum.
3136760	3138760	Downtown museum.
3138760	3139760	Huh?
3139760	3140760	Huh?
3140760	3141760	What?
3141760	3142760	Yeah.
3147760	3151760	Let's say Robert De Niro decides to get out of that Uber
3151760	3154760	because he's having a bad time, gets into a helicopter
3154760	3156760	and then starts a lawnmower.
3156760	3157760	Okay.
3157760	3158760	Okay.
3158760	3159760	Okay.
3159760	3162760	I just, no, I turned, I turned, I go to Western.
3162760	3163760	Don't take Western.
3163760	3164760	Don't take Western.
3164760	3166760	Don't just go to Franklin.
3166760	3167760	I know.
3167760	3168760	I take sweetie.
3168760	3169760	You don't know.
3169760	3170760	Let me out.
3170760	3171760	Just let me out of the Uber.
3171760	3172760	Let me out.
3172760	3173760	Let me out.
3173760	3174760	Let me out.
3174760	3175760	Let me out of the Uber.
3175760	3176760	Let me out of the Uber.
3176760	3180760	Also, an English ambulance goes by as this is happening.
3187760	3188760	Fuck's sake.
3194760	3201760	Throw in a can opener while the change house is going.
3201760	3204760	Lawnmower, lawnmower, lawnmower, lawnmower.
3204760	3207760	The helicopter changes gears.
3207760	3211760	The lawnmower is still going, but somebody needs to open a can of peas
3211760	3213760	and an electric can opener is there.
3221760	3222760	Do you hear that?
3223760	3226760	The lawnmower was going and then the electric can opener was on top of it.
3226760	3227760	Yeah.
3234760	3236760	I mean, the chopper is drowned out by the lawnmower.
3236760	3237760	Come on, man.
3237760	3239760	The recipe is Roger Huebner.
3241760	3242760	We did it.
3242760	3243760	Yeah.
3243760	3244760	Yeah.
3244760	3246760	That's a deep track for us.
3246760	3251760	When I met Dan in, what was it, 94 or something like that.
3252760	3253760	Wait.
3253760	3255760	Well, I mean, you want to talk about Roger Huebner.
3255760	3256760	You can.
3256760	3257760	I mean, rest in peace.
3257760	3258760	Roger Huebner.
3258760	3260760	He's a comedy sports sound effects guy.
3260760	3262760	He was buried with his microphone.
3264760	3272760	I was at Little Dom's with Danny DeVito and the can opener.
3272760	3280760	The waiter who was like taking our order and and it was like Danny DeVito.
3281760	3282760	I was like.
3283760	3284760	All right.
3284760	3285760	How's the chicken parmesan?
3286760	3288760	Like it's the size of a manhole cover.
3288760	3289760	You want to split it.
3289760	3291760	I was going to order the chicken parm too.
3291760	3292760	And he's like, all right.
3292760	3297760	Well, we'll split the chicken parmesan and the waiter's like, uh-huh.
3297760	3299760	And he's got kind of this weird look on his face.
3299760	3306760	Like he's kind of like fidgeting and he finishes taking the order.
3306760	3307760	It's a big table full of people.
3307760	3311760	Doing a little project with the DeVito clan.
3311760	3316760	Like sitting here, rare dinner and meeting with Danny DeVito.
3316760	3317760	It's fun.
3317760	3321760	Like waiter's like fidgeting and he's like, uh-huh.
3321760	3322760	Yeah.
3322760	3323760	So, okay.
3323760	3324760	So you wanted this and you wanted that.
3324760	3331760	And then he's just like, he goes like, um, uh, Michael Keaton's here.
3331760	3337760	And, uh, and he just got, I love about it.
3337760	3342760	It's like there are little Dom's every day, almost the staff there.
3342760	3343760	It's a fancy place.
3343760	3345760	There's a lot of celebrities come through.
3345760	3346760	So he wasn't nervous about you and Danny DeVito.
3346760	3348760	He was nervous that Michael Keaton was sitting right over there.
3348760	3349760	He is.
3349760	3354760	He, I mean, they, because Batman was in the same restaurant as the penguin is.
3355760	3360760	Oh, and so the waiter was like, and then it's like,
3360760	3363760	like, like, like the, the waiters, the waiters there are like,
3363760	3366760	they know better than the, like, like they're not there.
3366760	3370760	They, for all they know, they're going to get like yelled at fired.
3370760	3371760	Who knows?
3371760	3374760	Like for, you know, Los Angeles in general, as a culture, if you're
3374760	3377760	supposed to treat famous people like ghosts, you know, you're not supposed
3377760	3379760	to, cause they dress funny and they have unfinished business.
3379760	3384760	The, um, but the, the, the, the more you acknowledge them and where it's
3384760	3385760	like, what are you a tourist?
3385760	3388760	Like get out of here, especially if you're like your server at like a place
3388760	3391760	where there's like traffic celebrities.
3391760	3396760	Like you, I imagine your manager would be like, what fucking, uh,
3396760	3400760	Kristen Dunst come through here and you fucking like asked her for a selfie.
3400760	3401760	You piece of shit.
3401760	3403760	That was the first famous person that ever came in this restaurant.
3403760	3406760	She could have turned into three famous people, but you chased her off.
3406760	3407760	You smothered her.
3407760	3410760	You know, I imagine that that's what it's like, that there's that culture
3410760	3411760	unconsciously or not.
3411760	3415760	And so it was just like extra funny for him to, because he was clearly so,
3415760	3417760	the irony was too much for him.
3417760	3422760	He wasn't like star fucking, he was like, oh, Michael Keaton's here.
3422760	3423760	It's too much.
3423760	3424760	He can't handle it.
3424760	3425760	It's like the fucking thing.
3425760	3426760	And I was like, whoa, whoa.
3426760	3429760	If Christopher Walken walked in, that'd be fucking, yeah, forget about it.
3429760	3433760	And then, and then, and then D, D, Davido's like, like, uh, like, ah,
3433760	3435760	maybe I'll go talk to him later.
3435760	3438760	Like, like he's like, all right, baller.
3438760	3441760	Um, and, uh, and then later on here comes, here comes Michael Keaton.
3441760	3445760	And like, and, and I was, I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
3445760	3446760	You know?
3446760	3447760	Yeah.
3447760	3448760	Like, like, like, I thought we settled.
3448760	3449760	Yeah.
3449760	3452760	Like guys don't, not here.
3452760	3457760	And then, and then Michael Keaton kind of, he's carrying a toddler.
3457760	3460760	Like, uh, but not, but not his own.
3460760	3461760	Well, I don't know.
3461760	3462760	I don't know.
3462760	3463760	Yeah.
3463760	3468760	There was a screaming woman like, stop, stop, stop that famous man.
3468760	3469760	Stop that Batman.
3469760	3471760	Stop my toddler.
3471760	3472760	Batman stole my baby.
3472760	3476760	He's just kind of like hoisting, like a very, very like confident, like dad thing
3476760	3479760	where you got the kid, like kind of sitting on your bicep kind of thing.
3479760	3483760	Like, you know, like kids that kind of just, you know, situated on the, on the, on
3483760	3486760	the one, one arm and, uh, he's carrying him.
3486760	3491760	And, uh, and then he, and then I think he was, yes, ending my bit of like, whoa,
3491760	3492760	whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
3492760	3493760	You know?
3493760	3498760	And, and he kind of like, Michael Keaton kind of looked at Danny and then like,
3498760	3501760	he kind of went, ah, and I just thought it was so funny.
3501760	3505760	It was like, yeah, like I, and I really don't say this disparagingly.
3505760	3510760	I'm like, God, to get so old and to have such a full life that you're like, you
3510760	3514760	played Batman and you just kind of forgot what Batman is.
3516760	3519760	Like, like he's just like, maybe it's like Godzilla.
3519760	3520760	I don't know.
3520760	3521760	Oh yeah.
3521760	3522760	We fought in a movie.
3526760	3527760	And Danny DeVito did the same thing.
3527760	3530760	Like, ah, I was like, these guys don't know.
3530760	3534760	They, they, for all they know, they were the mummy and like fucking Frankenberry.
3534760	3537760	Like they don't, they're, they're just happy to see each other.
3541760	3544760	But then the crazy thing is like, then the two famous people like that, you know,
3544760	3548760	they, they, they, they talk to each other and it's like table full of people
3548760	3552760	that are all participating in the joke, like a spectacle, but then you have to
3552760	3555760	kind of just stare at the table and wait for them to finish talking.
3555760	3557760	Cause you can't, you're not friends.
3557760	3559760	You don't know these people.
3560760	3564760	Then they just talk about God knows what, and yeah.
3564760	3565760	That's great.
3565760	3566760	Yeah.
3566760	3569760	And then Jim Rash was there from, from community.
3569760	3573760	He was outside in the front and, and Levi's like, Jim Rash is here.
3573760	3575760	And I was like, ah.
3579760	3580760	That should be the new thing.
3580760	3582760	No matter who you meet.
3583760	3585760	You see an extra girlfriend.
3586760	3590760	By the way, you know, not to be this guy, but just to report in like,
3590760	3592760	Michael Keaton looks fantastic.
3592760	3593760	Yeah.
3593760	3596760	He's out there looking fantastic right now.
3597760	3598760	Yeah. He was Birdman.
3598760	3600760	How did Jim Rash look?
3600760	3601760	Birdman. Yeah, you're right.
3601760	3602760	I mean, he's just out there looking good.
3602760	3604760	Jim Rash is like, we'll get a little sketchy.
3604760	3606760	I heard he, I heard he's gotten jacked.
3607760	3608760	No, he did look, yeah.
3608760	3611760	You look like he's probably, I mean, he always was pretty fit.
3611760	3612760	I believe it.
3612760	3614760	I don't believe it.
3614760	3619760	He was with, I believe his writing partner and yeah, they were there.
3619760	3622760	And he was telling me about the project they just finished doing,
3622760	3625760	which I, I'll assume I'm not allowed to talk about, but whatever.
3625760	3626760	I don't know.
3626760	3627760	It sounded exciting.
3631760	3632760	Whatever.
3632760	3633760	This has been the celebrity.
3633760	3634760	I get excited.
3634760	3635760	Forgot.
3635760	3636760	I was at a restaurant with the fucking Batman and the.
3636760	3637760	Yeah.
3637760	3638760	I saw you recently.
3638760	3639760	You didn't tell me.
3639760	3640760	I mean, what a way.
3640760	3641760	It was like, like everything in me.
3641760	3642760	It was like, God damn it.
3642760	3647760	Do you fucking like, like what a wasted, you know, like, like,
3647760	3648760	you can't though.
3648760	3651760	I can't, I could, it was, it wasn't impossible to like, be like, guys,
3651760	3653760	they hate to do it, but could I.
3653760	3656760	Could get a photo, you know, and like, like, like be separating them.
3656760	3659760	And yeah, it's just, what a, what an Instagram.
3659760	3661760	That would have been what we call a golden gram.
3664760	3666760	You guys would, you guys would have loved that.
3666760	3667760	That's my Instagram.
3667760	3669760	You would have, you would have given it a heart.
3670760	3671760	That's why you're an influencer.
3673760	3674760	Yeah.
3674760	3675760	Yeah.
3675760	3677760	You never know when you're going to get one of those.
3677760	3678760	Oh, look at that.
3678760	3679760	I know that guy.
3679760	3680760	That's Batman.
3680760	3681760	Right.
3681760	3682760	Oh, there he is.
3682760	3683760	There's the penguin.
3683760	3684760	Oh, look who's in the middle.
3684760	3685760	Oh, so and so.
3685760	3687760	I've been watching the, the berries.
3687760	3688760	I love berry.
3688760	3689760	The HBO is a great show.
3689760	3694760	And years ago I was at a airport, maybe I've said this before.
3694760	3697760	And somebody walked up to Henry Winkler, who was just waiting for his
3697760	3700760	plane, like at the gate, sitting in the chair.
3701760	3703760	And somebody said, Mr. Winkler, I'm a big fan.
3703760	3704760	Can I get a photo?
3704760	3705760	And he goes, no.
3708760	3709760	That's the best.
3711760	3712760	He wasn't mean about it.
3712760	3713760	He was very polite.
3713760	3714760	No.
3714760	3717760	I'm like, I'm happily not taking a photo with you.
3719760	3720760	What's the one?
3720760	3721760	Malcolm McDowell.
3721760	3722760	I was in the airport.
3722760	3724760	Have you ever told this one on the show?
3724760	3729760	Malcolm McDowell from fucking Clockwork Orange and Entourage.
3731760	3734760	I think, I don't know that, but Malcolm McDowell was, we're in Calgary
3734760	3739760	airport and he was like looking at magazines at the, like the bookstore
3739760	3745760	place that has crap, you know, books and magazines and M&Ms and whatnot.
3745760	3750760	And a guy walks up like a young, youngish, you know, kind of fan boy and
3750760	3753760	comes to, Mr. McDowell, I'm a huge fan of yours.
3754760	3757760	Can I please get a photo or an autograph?
3757760	3758760	And he goes, no.
3760760	3765760	And the fucking kid just boned out.
3765760	3769760	And I was like, like I was watching this go down like, wow, that was fucking
3769760	3770760	harsh.
3770760	3771760	I've told the story before.
3771760	3772760	You must stop me.
3773760	3775760	You may have, but it's not.
3775760	3778760	But that is the cowboy hats because in Calgary Stampede, they give you the
3778760	3779760	cowboy hats.
3780760	3784760	So we did a show and if you, if you're a performer in Calgary, the chamber of
3784760	3789760	commerce gives you a white Stetson hat with a maple leaf on it.
3789760	3793760	And it's like, it's a big like symbol of honor from Calgary.
3793760	3799760	So me, Greg Proops, Ryan Styles, Chip Essendon, we all have our hats and we're
3799760	3800760	all getting on the same plane together.
3800760	3803760	And Malcolm McDowell is in front of me and he has his hat too.
3804760	3805760	So we're all loading in the first class.
3805760	3807760	We've all got cowboy hats.
3808760	3809760	I must have told the story before.
3809760	3811760	I bet you did, but it's like, I don't know.
3811760	3812760	It's so long ago.
3812760	3813760	I don't remember.
3813760	3814760	If we both forget, then who cares?
3815760	3816760	Let the audience decide.
3816760	3817760	Well, I mean, but they're helpless.
3817760	3818760	They're hostages.
3819760	3821760	Let them sit there and remember.
3821760	3823760	Why don't you marry remembering stuff?
3825760	3826760	You should have took a picture.
3826760	3829760	So we're getting on the plane and I'm, he's in front of me.
3829760	3833760	I'm number two getting on and he's got his cowboy hat and he's just told this
3833760	3839760	poor kid to bone out politely asking for interaction with Malcolm McDowell.
3839760	3840760	And he didn't take it.
3840760	3846760	And so he's in front of me and we're waiting to get on the, like, sit in our
3846760	3852760	seats and he's in row one and I'm in row two and he's putting his hat up in the
3852760	3854760	bin and I go, oh, I see you've got a hat too.
3854760	3856760	I used to just trying to find a way to talk to him.
3856760	3858760	And he goes, oh, yes.
3858760	3860760	Yes, I see you've got yours as well.
3860760	3861760	How did you get yours?
3861760	3862760	I get lost.
3862760	3866760	I said, I'm wearing like skinny jeans and like a motley cruise shirt.
3866760	3870760	Like I said, well, I'm a professional bull rider.
3870760	3872760	And he goes, you are?
3873760	3875760	Okay, now I remember.
3875760	3877760	And I go, no.
3877760	3879760	And he goes, oh, I wish you wouldn't have said that.
3879760	3882760	He would have been so happy that I was a professional bull rider.
3882760	3885760	He wanted to eat that Joe Pantoliano steak.
3885760	3886760	What?
3886760	3887760	Matrix.
3887760	3888760	Matrix.
3888760	3889760	Oh, wow.
3889760	3891760	That's what you lost me on that one.
3891760	3892760	Oh, I gotcha.
3892760	3893760	The steak was more delicious.
3893760	3894760	Yeah.
3894760	3897760	And then we watched him overact while he was learning his lines for entourage
3897760	3898760	the whole flight.
3898760	3902760	I wonder what it takes anecdotally.
3902760	3906760	Like, like, because I think to myself, like, like, like, what, what would it
3906760	3915760	take to ever arrive at a place where someone, you know, acknowledging like
3915760	3920760	recognition of you, somebody being like, Hey, look, there's Dan Harmon and
3920760	3924760	mine at fries, you know, like, like, like, which I'm like, like, like, what
3924760	3928760	would it take to make that so fucking like, like, like that you would be like,
3928760	3931760	no, like, I know the answer.
3931760	3932760	Like, I'm not an actor.
3932760	3933760	And obviously, have you never done that?
3933760	3936760	Have you ever been in a bad mood and somebody walked up and wanted some
3936760	3937760	interaction?
3937760	3938760	You said, go, go.
3938760	3941760	I mean, I've been, I've, I've only been, I think we've talked about this
3941760	3942760	before.
3942760	3946760	I've, there's only been like probably two instances in my entire life of anyone
3946760	3952760	ever talking to me like, uh, uh, in that context.
3952760	3956760	And it was only, it was the person was, look, I'll be honest with you.
3956760	3959760	I'm not a huge fan of the fucking autograph guys that sometimes like, like,
3959760	3962760	come out here and I'm sorry if you're in the audience because if you are, then
3962760	3964760	I misjudged you because part of why I don't like them is I don't even think
3964760	3965760	they come into the fucking show.
3965760	3969760	I think they, and I don't think they really give a fuck and they like, they,
3969760	3975760	they, they strike, they strike this tone of like, that's based on the shared
3975760	3976760	culture.
3976760	3979760	We all have, which is you should be grateful for somebody to want your
3979760	3985760	autograph, which you should, but like they, they build on that mythology and
3985760	3990760	use the same and go like, like, like at festivals and stuff, there's people
3990760	3992760	like, they don't know who you are.
3992760	3995760	They just like, they get like some heads up about who you are.
3995760	3999760	Like they're just there to like collect these piles of fucking signatures.
3999760	4000760	They don't give a shit.
4000760	4002760	And then that's fine too.
4002760	4006760	But, but like the way that they then they try to like, they play into your
4006760	4007760	guilt.
4007760	4008760	Like they, they go like, come on, man.
4008760	4009760	Oh, come on, man.
4009760	4010760	I've been out here all day.
4010760	4016760	Like they say shit that like is so inverse to like, come on, man.
4016760	4017760	Fuck you.
4017760	4018760	You can't high road me.
4018760	4021760	And like, it's like, that's it.
4021760	4024760	I mean, it's just, it's people that are disingenuous.
4024760	4027760	Nobody, nobody that's like hat in hand.
4027760	4032760	And I told the story of the, of that guy at the billiards place that like did
4032760	4035760	everything wrong, but I still wasn't mean to him ever.
4035760	4039760	It was just, I just like made fun of him on the show like later, but cause he
4039760	4041760	didn't really know who I was.
4041760	4045760	He thought I was Justin and he didn't like whatever, but it's still, I'm just,
4045760	4049760	I truly curious like, cause I'm sure the answer is like really wonderful.
4049760	4053760	Like what is it that happens to the Barbara Streisand's of the world, the
4053760	4057760	Malcolm McDowell is like, what stories do they have about people just like,
4057760	4062760	like just, there must be horrible things that have happened to them because they
4062760	4067760	allow somebody I know went up to, uh, like George Harrison at the airport,
4067760	4070760	LAX, and he was eating breakfast and he walked up to Mr. Harrison.
4070760	4071760	Can I get autograph?
4071760	4074760	And he goes, no, like, like, like I'm fucking having breakfast.
4074760	4077760	Like, like, like you don't get to walk up and interrupt.
4077760	4082760	And by the way, I have three coworkers and, and one of them got shot doing it.
4082760	4088760	Got shot doing this eating breakfast, like 25% of the people that do what I do
4088760	4090760	die this way.
4090760	4092760	I'm not, you're not catching me stoked.
4092760	4096760	Spencer, do you get, how much, uh, do you get rumbled for being Spencer walking
4096760	4097760	down the road?
4097760	4099760	Not really, pretty rarely.
4099760	4102760	Is it comfortable or uncomfortable for you?
4102760	4103760	Uh, I'm fine with it.
4103760	4104760	It's, uh, it's great.
4104760	4108760	You know, the thing about pictures, I always tell people who are awkward, like
4108760	4112760	the thing about pictures and autographs is they really frame the interaction.
4112760	4116760	You know, you know what they want, you know, when they have it and they know
4116760	4118760	that they, they can now leave satisfied.
4118760	4122760	Whereas if they don't ask for that, they kind of just like orbit and say things
4122760	4124760	like, Oh, I'm so nervous.
4124760	4125760	I don't know what to say.
4125760	4126760	You probably think I'm a loser.
4126760	4132760	And it's like, well, you're not giving me a lot of other options.
4132760	4134760	Like, I guess I do.
4134760	4137760	Okay.
4137760	4141760	But, uh, I mean, and it's fine to talk to people too, but it's just like, but when
4141760	4145760	you ask for an autograph, it's like, yeah, then you can shoot the shit or something.
4145760	4147760	But then they're like, Oh yeah, now I have my autograph.
4147760	4148760	I'm, I'm good to go.
4148760	4150760	And so that's always great.
4150760	4155760	But it's very rare for, uh, I don't know, for people, you know, sometimes people
4155760	4158760	just want to ask a lot of questions and it seems like they're just searching for
4158760	4159760	questions to ask.
4159760	4162760	And that's not always the best, but even that's not bad though.
4162760	4164760	Like the worst time I had was like this really drunk guy.
4164760	4168760	I want to say in Chicago or something that was like no joke wanting me to like
4168760	4170760	get in on his business opportunity.
4170760	4172760	Like one of you to buy a timeshare or some shit.
4172760	4174760	It's like, I don't want any of this.
4174760	4176760	And there's other people that want to talk to me too.
4176760	4179760	And I want to talk to them and I don't want to buy your timeshare or whatever.
4179760	4182760	You know, that, that was the worst, but, uh, that's always really great.
4182760	4186760	Um, I, I, I, I worked with this guy who said, I don't know.
4186760	4188760	It was like one of these beetle guys.
4188760	4193760	Um, he, he worked with one of these beetle guys in, uh, Britain and he was
4193760	4195760	drawing a little doodle.
4195760	4196760	Sorry.
4196760	4199760	When you say beetle guys, are we talking about Ringo Starr?
4199760	4200760	What's going on here?
4200760	4201760	Yeah.
4201760	4202760	It might've been George Harrison.
4202760	4203760	I don't know.
4203760	4204760	It's one of these beetle guys.
4204760	4205760	Right.
4205760	4206760	You don't know.
4206760	4208760	You worked with one of them.
4208760	4211760	No, I worked with a guy who worked with the guy who worked with the beetle guy.
4211760	4212760	Oh, oh.
4212760	4214760	So, uh, so a guy, yeah.
4214760	4215760	Okay.
4215760	4216760	All right.
4216760	4218760	I would have remembered if I worked with the bill guy.
4218760	4219760	It would have been your job to remember.
4219760	4220760	Yeah.
4220760	4221760	Right.
4221760	4222760	Exactly.
4222760	4227760	And he was like drawn a picture and then, um, and then he put, he put it down and, uh,
4227760	4231760	and then like one of his assistants came and took the picture and put it into a folder
4231760	4232760	and like whisked it away.
4232760	4235760	And he was like, why, why did that just happen?
4235760	4240760	And he's like, well, the, the, these people stole my lyrics out of my car and they're
4240760	4242760	in the, they're in a museum and they won't give them back now.
4242760	4246760	So now I have this guy and he takes all the stuff I touch and he photocopies it and keeps
4246760	4247760	it away from people.
4247760	4251760	And that's, that's like a level of fame where you probably are just like, I mean, your
4251760	4255760	whole worldview must be upside down just because it's like people will just thought
4255760	4256760	with your shit.
4256760	4257760	That was Paul McCartney for sure.
4257760	4259760	Oh, it might've been Paul McCartney.
4259760	4260760	Yeah.
4260760	4261760	Yeah.
4261760	4265760	I told, I told this story when I was, I was at South by and I was, I was on the same flight
4265760	4271760	as Padgett Brewster and, um, she, she, there were people waiting outside the airport for
4271760	4274760	her, which, uh, was a different level.
4274760	4278760	Uh, it was like, like not just waiting outside the airport cause there's celebrities coming
4278760	4282760	around cause it's South by, but they, they had like shit that was Padgett Brewster related.
4282760	4286760	But then they, there were also people that were like, no, they had a bunch of blank pieces
4286760	4292760	of paper, photo paper, like glossy paper, which by fucking, oh, when you sign photo
4292760	4294760	paper, it's like nails on chalkboard.
4294760	4297760	It's like squeaky, that squeaky, like freak.
4297760	4298760	I don't know.
4298760	4300760	Like we'll talk about unrelatable Harmon.
4300760	4301760	What the fuck?
4301760	4304760	But, but like I remember, cause I remember somebody was like, oh, you too, can I get
4304760	4307760	you think like, like, it was just like throwing me a bone.
4307760	4308760	Like, cause there's just blank things.
4308760	4312760	And then I walked into the airport and I'm like, they just, they acted like they thought
4312760	4314760	I was famous because I was with you.
4314760	4316760	And she's like, yeah, but you know what?
4316760	4321760	Those people, they make me sign those blank pieces of photo paper and then they print
4321760	4322760	fake nudes on them.
4322760	4323760	Yeah.
4323760	4326760	And then a fake nude signed by Padgett?
4326760	4327760	What?
4327760	4328760	I did.
4328760	4331760	That's just blows my, that's almost too hilarious to be abuse.
4331760	4336760	Like, cause it's just like, well, oh, look, I, I mean, it's like, what is the, like,
4336760	4340760	you're selling that like, look, she signed, is it like a troll thing?
4340760	4341760	Like,
4341760	4345760	it sounds like probably the intent is like she did it for someone she was like intimate
4345760	4346760	with and it's like stolen.
4346760	4348760	It's like, oh, this was a real thing.
4348760	4350760	She sent her boyfriend or something.
4350760	4351760	Yeah.
4351760	4352760	Yeah.
4352760	4356760	She also, she also did say that like she said, she said she tends to get like pulled
4356760	4361880	aside at TSA checkpoints because, and she was like, cause she was on this like criminal
4361880	4369040	minds show or whatever, like created by me, the TSA people are like really into these
4369040	4371440	certain mainstream crime dramas.
4371440	4376000	And like they always recognize her and she said an inordinate that they, that they'll
4376000	4378000	pull her down.
4378000	4379000	Yeah.
4379000	4382320	And it's like, they're not, I don't think, I mean, like, I don't think she would want
4382320	4385920	me to say imply that they're doing it so that they can touch her.
4385920	4392440	It's more like they want to take her aside and like then tell her they're a big fan.
4392440	4396080	It's not, they're not going down and giving her the full business of like, I think it's
4396080	4399000	kind of like, yeah, special, can I check your bag?
4399000	4400000	Like thing.
4400000	4403040	And then it's like, by the way, can I get a selfie like, like, like, cause I would hate
4403040	4408320	to imply in this, in this climate, like, you know, like you need to take that shit seriously.
4408320	4413440	Like this idea of like, that wasn't part of the idea was that they were doing it to,
4413440	4414440	to grope.
4414440	4417000	It was much more, but it was still, it's still fucking crazy.
4417000	4420360	The idea that they're like, oh yeah, random spot check.
4420360	4422400	I think your bag smells like explosives.
4422400	4423400	So can you come over here?
4423400	4428640	By the way, big fan cha-ching like, like, yeah, I mean, you expect more from the TSA.
4428640	4433560	Spencer, I'm going to come over there and grab a character sheets if I may.
4433560	4434560	Okay.
4434560	4435560	Hold on.
4435560	4436560	Did I fill the time?
4437560	4442280	This is why I got to become a musician because it's like, when I moved to LA, I was like,
4442280	4447640	Hey, let's go see Harry Dean Stanton at this like, uh, hotel lounge, or you go see Jeff
4447640	4449240	Goldblum play piano.
4449240	4451480	I was like part of the LA culture.
4451480	4457400	Like I, I, I, I, I, I either got to like stop doing this show or I got to like learn the
4457400	4459920	clarinet or something.
4459920	4460920	Cause it's like dumb.
4460920	4464000	Otherwise like who wants to, and I'm tired, tired of it.
4464000	4465440	What am I supposed to tell you about?
4465440	4467240	I can't tell you anything about my new house.
4467240	4469080	Cause then you can come and shoot me.
4469080	4473200	I can't, I can't tell you I'm afraid you'll shoot me because then that's alienating.
4473200	4475680	Like, Oh, please shoot me.
4475680	4478160	Like, Oh, what a cool guy wishes he was shot.
4478160	4481320	It's no, there's no, there's no, there's no reward in it.
4481320	4485000	I'm not being provocative or being a dick by asking this question, but have you fired
4485000	4487480	your gun and used it and like gone to the range?
4487480	4489240	You're my, no, my actual gun.
4489240	4492480	No, I'm afraid to fire it because the first thing I did when I bought it is take it apart
4492480	4494480	and clean it, put it back together.
4494480	4499920	So now, so now it's a gun that's been assembled by a fucking idiot.
4499920	4503800	It should just have a sticker on it that says like a fucking liberal that got scared cause
4503800	4506840	Trump got elected bought this, like put this together.
4506840	4508440	Like don't ever pull the trigger.
4508440	4511120	It's going to blow up in your hands.
4511120	4513240	I want, I, that's why I want to get a revolver.
4513240	4514240	You actually stripped field.
4514240	4515240	Yeah.
4515240	4517000	Cause that's the thing I couldn't wait to do.
4517000	4521480	I mean, that was like a huge, I was like, I always wanted to like take a gun apart.
4521480	4523480	And so I did.
4523480	4524480	Now it's a man.
4524480	4525480	And I like put it back together.
4525480	4529960	I'm like, well, that doesn't seem like it should be rattling.
4529960	4532880	I guess they rattle in the movies, but I always thought that was like overindulgent
4532880	4533880	Foley artists.
4533880	4538680	You know, like every time drama goes like this, the gun goes like, you know, like I
4538680	4542760	just always thought that was like audio guys being like, oh man, fucking like clinkety
4542760	4543760	clink clink.
4543760	4545200	Give me, give me more clinks on that.
4545200	4549400	But it's like, no, those things really kind of rattle in your hand, which it just makes
4549400	4553080	me feel like it's going to blow up when I shoot it.
4553080	4554080	Really terrified.
4554080	4555080	Which is good though.
4555080	4557720	Cause I told the story of like the guy on my porch and like, you know, and Spencer's
4557720	4561880	talked about how they do studies where you touch one of these things and your testosterone
4561880	4562960	goes up.
4562960	4567160	And like the danger of having one of these things, it's like, it's, it's good to think
4567160	4569160	that it will explode if I fire it.
4569160	4574680	Like that's, that's better than that's, that's second best to not owning a gun is, is being
4574680	4580040	so afraid to fire it that cause you think you probably kill yourself and then you blow
4580040	4582720	up your hand along with the intruder.
4582720	4583720	Yeah.
4583720	4587560	Unless you're trying to kill yourself with a gun and then it's like about the same.
4587560	4593360	That would be amazing if you got the gun and then you're like, I'm going to blow my brains
4593360	4596280	out and then it like goes, it just takes your hand off.
4596280	4597280	Yeah.
4597280	4600840	And you're like, ow, you call 911 and they're like, what's your emergency?
4600840	4602240	And you're like, I blew my hand off.
4602240	4603840	They're like, sir, calm down.
4603840	4607120	Uh, what did you, you tell, what was the thing you told you?
4607120	4608120	Oh yeah.
4608120	4609120	Someone sent us here.
4609480	4617400	Some, someone sent us a in or me in Instagram message, um, I just had it.
4617400	4622080	That was about the night, you know, Dan, uh, says that in these, these podcasts, whenever
4622080	4626520	you call 911, they tell you to calm down or whatever.
4626520	4628840	And someone's, this is a good story, huh?
4628840	4629840	No, it is.
4629840	4631280	I mean, I, I, I love that.
4631280	4635400	I love our fan community that somebody, somebody sent you a message basically saying that they
4635400	4641240	had a, they had an experience where they called 911 and because they needed to calmly
4641240	4642240	inform.
4642240	4643240	Yeah.
4643240	4644240	Shit.
4644240	4646600	I can't fucking hold on.
4646600	4647600	Everybody shut up.
4647600	4648600	Uh, yeah.
4648600	4654880	The guy needed to call 911 because he saw someone passed out in the street or something
4654880	4658880	and he thought they needed like medical attention or something.
4658880	4665360	And the rest may surprise you cat underscore E underscore Reyes writes off topic to the
4665440	4669400	post, but driving home today, I found a man passed out in a park and while calmly calling
4669400	4671680	911, I was told to calm down.
4671680	4674480	I just think that's so funny.
4674480	4675480	It really happens.
4675480	4678120	Why do they tell you to calm down so much?
4678120	4681200	They can't, that's like, that's their one, that's their one joy in life.
4681200	4687000	If you call them calm, they're, they're, they're, you're going to end up in prison, man.
4687000	4695160	This guy was so calm, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm telling you, I'm going to
4695160	4696800	be so calm.
4696800	4699520	If I call 911 that I'm not going to call 911.
4699520	4704560	I'm going to like try to fake like panic.
4704560	4706200	Like I'm going to come home with Cody's murdered.
4706200	4708160	I'm going to be like, oh shit, Cody got murdered.
4708160	4712760	Uh, all right, um, I'm going to call 911 and they're going to think I did it because I'm
4712760	4716320	going to be calm because I'm like compartmentalized.
4716320	4717320	You know, like, I don't know.
4717320	4720120	I have like a fucking thing that's a problem.
4720120	4724760	And then like, so then I'm going to go like, oh my God, my wife is dead.
4725760	4731880	And they're going to be like, that's fake.
4731880	4738120	When there was this situation I drove by, um, kind of near your neighborhood where some,
4738120	4742380	it seemed like some, I don't know, some plain clothes cops who just looked like guys with
4742380	4747080	guns in their waistband, like, uh, we're costing this dude in a car and trying to pull him
4747080	4748080	out of his car.
4748080	4749080	And the guy was screaming for help.
4749080	4753000	I'm pretty sure cause the cops didn't identify themselves as cops.
4753000	4754500	And so I was like, I don't know what to do.
4754500	4756720	And I called three one one and I didn't go anywhere.
4756720	4759880	And then I called nine one one and it, uh, it was just like jam.
4759880	4760880	The lions were jammed.
4760880	4761880	Like I couldn't get through it.
4761880	4763280	I'm like, it's a good thing.
4763280	4765500	This isn't an emergency happening to me.
4765500	4768500	I'd be out of luck.
4768500	4774060	I have to, I have to meet with an estate planner, which is a meeting that is just really easy
4774060	4775060	to keep canceling.
4775060	4776060	Sure.
4776060	4779360	Like when are you ever in the mood to have coffee and talk about what should happen when
4779360	4781900	you die with all your money?
4781900	4784660	I'm just always like, Oh, is that at noon today?
4784660	4785660	Yeah.
4785660	4787100	I am folding my socks.
4787100	4790380	I kind of feel like that would be a fun meeting to have.
4790380	4791380	Yeah.
4791380	4795220	I, I, I keep a note in my, uh, iPhone updated.
4795220	4796220	Well, you take mine.
4796220	4797220	Computer.
4797220	4798220	Cause here's what I want to tell the person.
4798220	4801900	I'm going to be like, cause I told Cody is like, yeah, I gotta, you know, we're getting
4801900	4802900	a house together.
4802900	4806660	I, I definitely, here's what I, here's a nightmare scenario.
4806660	4808140	Something God forbid happens to me.
4808140	4809620	Let's just call it hit by a bus.
4809620	4816020	Even though we know that bus is going to be cholesterol, um, but like, let's, let's
4816020	4821060	just say it's like sudden and like unexpected and it's just done.
4821060	4827180	Like the, the idea of loving Cody, moving in a house together, we're not married yet.
4827180	4833060	Like, and she's just like living in this house that she's not, you know, she chose it with
4833060	4837880	me, but she's not like, you know, she doesn't have a claim to it if I die.
4837880	4843080	And then like, all of a sudden, like, you know, some horrendous relative from Wisconsin
4843080	4844080	and who knows?
4844080	4849480	I don't like, like shit town like, like, yeah, like, like, I don't know, I don't know how
4849480	4850480	that shit works.
4850480	4851600	Like the probate and all that stuff.
4851600	4855480	So anyway, I mean, there's a, there's a nightmare scenario to be avoided and Cody and I are
4855480	4856480	aware of it.
4856480	4861080	But then I'm like, you got another problem if you're like, I'm like driving with Cody
4861080	4866680	and I'm like, yeah, I gotta, I want to plan my estate, but you need to know, like I need,
4866680	4870120	there needs to be like a Schrödinger's box here so that you're not incentivized to
4870120	4871120	kill me.
4871120	4876160	Like, like, like, and she's like, well, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna kill you.
4876160	4878360	I'm like, that's what she'd say if she was gonna kill you.
4878360	4879360	Right.
4879360	4880360	That's that.
4880360	4881360	That's what you'd say if you were gonna kill me.
4881360	4886440	But and I'm like, look, here's, here's what I'm gonna do when I plan my estate.
4886440	4893280	I'm gonna, I'm gonna have no matter how unmysterious my death is, like, let's, let's say I'm worth
4893280	4894640	five million when I die.
4894640	4899760	I'm just picking a number that's based on when you look up the thing, it says like,
4899760	4901520	what are they worth dot net or whatever.
4901520	4905440	It's for I've says I'm worth five million and I don't know what that means.
4905440	4907160	I think they're counting the fish tank.
4907160	4912000	But the, let's say, let's say that's what I'm worth.
4912000	4919400	And then so I want to put in my, in my will a million dollars is earmarked for a private
4919400	4924520	investigator doesn't even matter if it looks like a heart attack smart.
4925520	4927000	He or she, you're welcome.
4927000	4928000	Thanks.
4928000	4938880	$200,000 for expenses to launch an investigation as if my death were mysterious, even if it's
4938880	4940640	not mysterious.
4940640	4943600	If it's mysterious, 400,000.
4943600	4951920	But the remainder of the million payable upon conviction of the murderer.
4951920	4957280	So here's what, and then Cody's like, but that means he's, he would frame me.
4957280	4964920	I'm like, what it means is your job is to keep me alive.
4964920	4969800	It also means she, she'll, she'll be, uh, she'll have a vested interest in trying to make
4969800	4973840	herself as look as innocent as possible and keep tabs in that way, no matter what she's
4973840	4974840	plotting.
4974840	4979440	It just means when the pizza comes, if I'm a certain amount of drunk, like don't make
4979440	4980840	me go down for it.
4980840	4982080	Like there's stairs here.
4982080	4985720	Like I could, you know, you could end up in jail.
4985720	4987240	People will assume you murdered me.
4987240	4989520	Or like she'll videotape you while you do that.
4989520	4991800	Maybe she'll just start wearing a GoPro everywhere.
4991800	4992800	A body cam.
4992800	4993800	Yeah.
4993800	4997960	Cause she's like, well, just put mysterious circumstances.
4997960	4999320	I'm like, oh yeah, right.
4999320	5003800	So you can like crush up Adderall and put it in my vodka and like, oh yeah, what a non
5003800	5005600	mysterious heart attack that would be.
5005600	5008080	Give me a break.
5008080	5011840	Someone's just waiting for me to keel over from a hot dog.
5011840	5013640	I want that shit investigated.
5013640	5014640	Yeah.
5014640	5016840	I think that it could be really fun.
5016840	5020800	You could put some more money to like document in the process and like make a movie out of
5020800	5021800	it.
5021800	5022800	Yeah.
5022800	5023800	Put it on Netflix.
5023800	5026360	The death of Dan.
5026360	5030760	I wonder if you can, if you can make, do it like percentages, like whatever my net worth
5030760	5036360	is, you probably can 10% shall go to private investigator.
5036360	5037920	Yeah.
5038920	5040000	That's a, that's a, that's a death.
5040000	5043720	I could have fun planning.
5043720	5049600	You know, well, if the autopsy or your body though, that'll like maybe make it look gross.
5049600	5050600	Is that cool?
5050600	5051600	Yeah.
5051600	5052600	Okay.
5052600	5053600	I already look gross.
5053600	5054600	I yeah.
5054600	5057640	Hey, you said it.
5057640	5061840	The grosser I look, the more people understand than I, I did well with my life.
5061840	5063880	You know, like, like, like, they're like, oh, he looks gross.
5063880	5065800	Why is he, why am I looking at his body?
5065800	5067200	I'm like, yeah, exactly.
5067200	5068200	Fucker.
5068200	5069200	Haha.
5069200	5073480	I'm not Marilyn Monroe and you're looking at me naked, dummy.
5073480	5075000	Looks like I'm talented.
5075000	5076160	Fuck face.
5076160	5077160	Keep looking.
5077160	5081480	You have to keep taking every inch, you fucking jerk.
5081480	5084560	That's why I don't put a piece of tape over my laptop camera.
5084560	5087760	I'm like, take it in CIA.
5087760	5092120	Fucking look at my little dick.
5092120	5095880	Record every fucking second of it.
5095880	5098120	Put it in the Library of Congress.
5098120	5101640	Make a statue of me jerking off fucking spies.
5101640	5103720	Who cares?
5103720	5108920	Can you imagine like, what if I became like a, what kind of like activist do you have
5108920	5109920	to become?
5109920	5114360	Like how much of a threat do you have to be before the NSA uses secret footage of you
5114360	5116200	jerking off on your Mac book?
5116200	5117200	Like they just release it.
5117200	5119400	Like, well, like how would that work on anybody?
5119400	5123840	You know, like, like, hmm, this modern day MLK is causing too much trouble.
5123840	5128280	He's suggesting people should withhold their income taxes until medicine is socialized.
5128280	5130520	But did you know he jerks off?
5130520	5137660	Oh, oh, I love jerking off, oh, I love jerking off, oh, oh, I'm coming, I'm coming, oh.
5137660	5139600	You can see the cum in this one.
5139600	5140600	Look at that cum.
5140600	5143640	Oh, what a monster, he jerks off.
5143640	5146400	Like it's not going to work.
5146400	5147600	It's not going to work on anybody.
5147600	5148600	Yeah.
5148600	5149800	That would be a refreshing world.
5149800	5150800	I hope that leaks.
5150800	5153400	I hope, I hope footage of all of us jerking off leaks.
5153840	5154840	You could leak it.
5154840	5161740	You should, you should, I think it's called, I think it's called YouTube.
5161740	5166360	You could not only have your camera on your computer open, but put a green screen behind
5166360	5169760	it so the NSA could really make it fun.
5169760	5174040	I always kind of, I throw in little things hoping like I can like trigger something.
5174040	5176560	I'll be like jerking off, I'll be like, yeah, you like that?
5176560	5177560	Al-Qaeda.
5177560	5180000	Oh, you like it when Al-Qaeda comes on your tits?
5180000	5181680	No, you don't.
5181680	5182680	That's pretty good.
5182920	5183920	That'll really do it.
5186480	5190880	So Spencer, D&D, you've given us brand new stuff here.
5191080	5195480	You've moved us over from Pathfinder, I see, to a D&D based thing.
5195480	5198800	So I'm going through my exciting new character.
5198800	5204120	I spent a good portion a yesterday converting all your character sheets to fifth edition.
5205760	5208080	Wow. Fifth edition fans.
5208960	5213440	And you put our spells and abilities on special groovy little cards here.
5213440	5215400	I made spell cards.
5215400	5216400	You made these?
5216400	5217400	These are great.
5217400	5220400	I mean, I didn't Photoshop them, but I glued them onto note cards.
5220400	5221400	You did.
5221400	5223040	I love this.
5223040	5226880	You've given little dots for ones that are always prepared for my spells.
5226880	5230480	I tried to do, you know, I don't know.
5230480	5231480	It's fun.
5231480	5232480	It's like an arts and crafts task.
5232480	5233480	No, I'm digging it, man.
5233480	5236800	I could read this all night long.
5236800	5240600	Let's let's just read your spells.
5240600	5241880	But let's start off with that.
5241880	5244600	You gave us you gave me a list of group inventory.
5244600	5248880	So yeah, I used to just give Steve Levy that sheet of group inventory.
5248880	5250120	Let's bring up Steve Levy, everybody.
5250120	5251120	Levy.
5263440	5265080	New, new, new stuff.
5265120	5266080	Oh, come on.
5266080	5268160	Come in with some energy.
5268160	5272360	Where where where is this showbiz energy that we're used to from you?
5272360	5273360	Tits and feathers.
5273360	5274360	Levy.
5274360	5275360	Tits and feathers.
5275360	5279160	We opened in three nights.
5279160	5280160	Levy.
5280160	5284640	Let's check in with you briefly because we have we have a lot of inventory stuff to talk
5284640	5285640	about here.
5285640	5286640	OK.
5286640	5287640	Oh, yeah.
5287640	5288640	What's going on?
5288640	5289640	How are you?
5289640	5290640	Things good.
5290640	5291640	Things are good.
5291640	5292640	Yeah.
5292640	5293640	Yeah.
5293640	5294640	You got a neat little Welsh horn haircut going on there.
5294640	5295640	Thank you.
5295640	5296640	Yeah.
5296640	5297640	Yeah.
5297640	5298640	Yeah.
5298640	5299640	How's things in the romance world?
5299640	5300640	Or should I ask?
5300640	5301640	Things are good.
5301640	5302640	Oh, yeah.
5302640	5303640	You got a squeeze now?
5303640	5304640	Yeah.
5304640	5306640	You got a partial squeeze?
5306640	5307640	Yeah.
5307640	5308640	I got it.
5308640	5309640	I got a squeeze.
5309640	5310640	Partial squeeze.
5310640	5311640	Levy squeeze.
5311640	5312640	Squeeze Levy.
5312640	5313640	We got it.
5313640	5315400	We have confirmed Levy squeeze.
5315400	5319200	Houston, we have Levy squeeze.
5319200	5324440	Well, I was about to ask why don't you tell me?
5324440	5329320	It's like, well, the answer is obvious because I won't reward you for it.
5329320	5334960	I mean, I've more pressing matters to talk to you about, you know, like, you know, we
5334960	5335960	had a lot of work and stuff.
5335960	5337960	I'm a cold son of a gun.
5337960	5338960	That's it.
5338960	5342120	Remember when I got drunk in New York and I sent you a nice text, though?
5342120	5343120	Yeah.
5343120	5345080	No, I'll never forget that text.
5345080	5346080	Damn.
5346080	5348160	It was a pretty it was an amazing text.
5348160	5349160	What was the text?
5349160	5354000	It was just, you know, it was like the nicest things anyone could ever say.
5354000	5357920	We have to start D&D, like at the beginning of the show because we're never going to ever
5357920	5358920	saw whatever.
5358920	5364360	I like talking with Levy like I don't care if we ever get to it, but like Spencer did
5364360	5366480	all this amazing like paperwork here.
5366480	5368400	I feel like it sounds like you kind of care.
5368400	5369400	I do care.
5369400	5371360	Spencer, I'm very excited about this.
5371360	5372360	I do.
5372360	5373800	I do mean the stuff I say when I'm drunk.
5373800	5374800	By the way.
5374800	5375800	No.
5375800	5376800	Yeah.
5376800	5377800	No, I don't think unless it's racist.
5377800	5378800	Right.
5378800	5380600	I haven't.
5380600	5390680	That stuff is just like I'm going through all this text to be validating how much you
5390680	5398960	meant it about building seven is just that vodka talk stuff about you being a good friend
5398960	5400680	and me wishing the best for you.
5400680	5408440	That's just, you know, that's the polar ice caps of the world.
5408440	5409440	All right.
5409440	5413320	Let's I think the best we can do, Spencer, before the time runs out is that we just go
5413320	5419400	through where you've set us with a new D&D fifth edition kind of set up here.
5419400	5420400	Yeah.
5420400	5425920	Well, the thing is in fifth edition, your character sheet has a little spot for personality
5425920	5428960	traits, bonds and flaws.
5428960	5430320	So maybe we should work those out.
5430320	5435920	I know that'll be exciting for the audience, but it's helpful and it might help you, you
5435920	5440200	know, get some, get some, get some, get some, get some.
5440200	5441200	It'll help us get some.
5441200	5442200	Yeah.
5442200	5443840	D&D is all about getting some.
5443840	5444840	Okay.
5444840	5446440	So personality traits.
5446440	5447440	Do you guys?
5447440	5448440	Okay.
5448440	5449440	So do you guys remember?
5449440	5450440	Well, obviously Jeff remembers he likes fire.
5450440	5454000	Do you guys remember your characters at all?
5454000	5460200	Diarrhea, you're into, we know you love horses for some strange reasons.
5460720	5461720	Yeah.
5461720	5463640	I, I, I know my character.
5463640	5464640	All right.
5464640	5468200	Well, then it should be easy to pick a personality trait or two.
5468200	5470520	And how does that help us throughout the gameplay?
5470520	5474280	Because then you, you know, that that's like kind of a part of your character.
5474280	5478800	Like, like I would say, you know, lately Chad has been like, he's trying to kick the bee's
5478800	5482320	nest or something, you know, that's just kind of who he is.
5482320	5486200	So if you, if you write that on your character and then you look at it, be like, Oh, that's
5486200	5487480	who I am.
5487480	5488840	You know, gotcha.
5488840	5494000	So this, this box on the right are the traits and I get to pick two of those.
5494000	5495000	The top right.
5495000	5496000	One or two.
5496000	5497000	Yeah.
5497000	5498000	The top right.
5498000	5499000	We could do this later.
5499000	5500000	I guess you didn't write.
5500000	5501000	Oh, I got right in anything myself.
5501000	5502000	Yeah.
5502000	5504800	That's the idea is that, that will, will kind of reacquaint you guys with your characters
5504800	5506780	now that they're new in fifth edition.
5506780	5510320	You can't put like constantly finding treasure.
5510320	5513800	That's not, no, no, that's not, that's a dream.
5513800	5514800	Not a trade.
5514800	5515800	Right.
5515800	5519640	He tends to hit more when he attacks.
5519640	5520640	That's not a fly.
5520640	5521640	Yeah.
5521640	5522640	I would fly.
5522640	5525760	So what would be a good example of a personality trait?
5525760	5527240	Let's say for Chad, the fireliker.
5527240	5530480	I would say he's, he's itching for adventure.
5530480	5531480	At least lately.
5531480	5534960	That's like been a big thing of your like, we can't be fucking potato farming.
5534960	5537840	We got to be, I'm going to call that wanderlust.
5537840	5538840	Yeah.
5538840	5539840	There you go.
5539840	5540840	All right.
5540840	5541840	I like it.
5541840	5542840	It's dumb.
5542840	5544040	I'm just trying to encourage.
5544040	5545320	No, I know.
5545320	5546320	You have to.
5546320	5551360	I do have to, but it could help or not ideals.
5551360	5552360	What's that?
5552360	5553360	What's that about?
5553360	5557160	Ideals is like a, what you value kind of like your, your virtue, like what you, what you
5557160	5558160	find important.
5558160	5559160	Yeah.
5559160	5562240	I'll have to think about that one.
5562240	5563240	Oh yeah.
5563240	5564600	Well, like fire for instance.
5564600	5565600	Well, yeah.
5565600	5570280	Well, we know I like fire, but is that more like in a, like a spiritual or philosophical
5570280	5571280	thing?
5571280	5572280	Huh?
5572280	5573280	Yeah.
5573280	5574280	Bond's probably better than ideal.
5574280	5575280	Absolutely.
5575280	5577400	Bond is like what a, what you care about.
5577400	5581800	What if it was Rob from Rob from you would really get your goat and make you like murder
5581800	5584360	people or go out and find stuff.
5584360	5585360	Gotcha.
5585360	5586360	And flaws.
5586360	5587360	Flaws and personality flaws.
5587360	5588360	Yeah.
5588360	5589360	You're afraid of the dark.
5589360	5590360	Yep.
5590360	5591360	I'm afraid of the dark.
5591360	5592360	Yeah.
5592360	5593360	See, I, it's a bit weak as a flaw.
5593360	5594360	But it's true.
5594360	5600080	Or you could just come up with a new one since you don't know how to use the audience because
5600080	5601840	you guys have listened to the show and you remember.
5601840	5602840	Oh, that's a good idea.
5602840	5603840	Yeah.
5604400	5606360	So somebody let's, let's spit ball.
5606360	5608560	What are Chad's ideals?
5608560	5611960	Ah, ha ha.
5611960	5612960	Virginity.
5612960	5613960	Virginity?
5613960	5616480	I don't know about that.
5616480	5617480	Courage.
5617480	5618480	Courage.
5618480	5619480	Yeah.
5619480	5621480	I like it.
5621480	5623680	So my deal would be courage.
5623680	5624680	Courage.
5624680	5625680	It doesn't mean I'm courageous.
5625680	5628120	It just means I wish I were more courageous.
5628120	5629120	You value.
5629120	5630120	Yeah.
5630120	5632480	You, you want to, you know, like brashness almost.
5632480	5633800	And what's my bond?
5634400	5635400	Fire.
5635400	5636400	Yeah.
5636400	5637400	It's burning.
5637400	5641000	You can't bond with fire.
5641000	5642000	And I think you can.
5642000	5644000	And Chad's a flaw.
5644000	5645000	Yams?
5645000	5646000	No.
5646000	5647320	Yams?
5647320	5648600	What's the yams?
5648600	5651520	You just wanted to say yams.
5651520	5652520	He is impulsive.
5652520	5653520	Yeah.
5653520	5654520	And hubristic.
5654520	5655520	Impulsive.
5655520	5656520	Impulsive.
5656520	5657520	Okay.
5657520	5658520	I like that.
5658520	5659520	I'm taking yams.
5659520	5660520	I wanted to say it.
5661520	5666640	So, Levi, for my personality traits, I thought spontaneous and easily impressed.
5666640	5667640	I like that.
5667640	5669040	That's great.
5669040	5671960	What about your ideals?
5671960	5673240	Can you give me some examples?
5673240	5678000	Like upholding the law or always being kind to people.
5678000	5680120	Oh, kindness is key.
5680120	5681120	Kindness is key.
5681120	5683120	Write that.
5683120	5685120	Then bond.
5685120	5686120	I don't know.
5686120	5687120	Of course.
5687120	5688120	Of course.
5688120	5689120	Of course.
5689840	5690840	Oh, yeah.
5690840	5691840	Carlos.
5691840	5692840	Carlos isn't bad.
5692840	5693840	Yeah.
5693840	5694840	Because he's like...
5694840	5695840	Yeah.
5695840	5696840	These guys are your kind of surrogate family.
5696840	5697840	Yeah.
5697840	5698840	He's like my father figure.
5698840	5701360	And flaws then.
5701360	5703960	Probably you're naive, I'd imagine, right?
5703960	5704960	So naive.
5704960	5706840	There you go.
5706840	5707840	Hell yeah.
5707840	5708840	This is going better than I thought.
5708840	5709840	All right.
5709840	5710840	It's not going great.
5710840	5711840	Harmon, you're up.
5711840	5714120	What are your personality traits?
5714120	5716920	Well, I feel like I'm insecure.
5716920	5717920	I like that.
5718680	5723920	I mean, do you think it's a good strategy in a meta sense to like to embrace the way
5723920	5727640	you're tending to play or do you think it's a better idea to like go against that so that
5727640	5734120	you don't like fall back on that because I like I tend to be insecure in my playing.
5734120	5738440	But maybe if I was playing a character who I'm like, oh, my character's like, ooh, he's
5738440	5739440	Johnny Begga donuts.
5739440	5740440	How about your...
5740440	5741440	Right.
5741440	5742720	I'd say the latter is a little better.
5742720	5743720	But it's probably not.
5743720	5747400	How about one of your traits is overthinking it?
5747400	5749080	That could be one.
5749080	5756800	My characters always like to be just relaxed and not rock the boat.
5756800	5757800	But I'm not suggesting that.
5757800	5758800	That's just like...
5758800	5759800	So your ideals, Harmon?
5759800	5761080	How do you say overthinking it?
5761080	5762840	Like in personality traits?
5762840	5763840	Like...
5763840	5764840	Like...
5764840	5765840	A worrier.
5765840	5766840	A worrier.
5766840	5767840	A worrier.
5767840	5768840	Not right against.
5768840	5769840	Neurotic.
5769840	5772240	That seems like a good...
5772240	5778320	My ideals I would say like virtue, like what kind of like, you know, like I want to do
5778320	5780920	it right.
5780920	5781920	Virtue's good.
5781920	5785920	I want to leave the world better than I, you know, like I want...
5785920	5786920	Just justice.
5786920	5787920	Redemption?
5787920	5788920	Redeemer?
5788920	5790960	There's a redemptive quality to what you want to do.
5790960	5792680	You want to kind of redeem what's gone wrong.
5792680	5793680	Yeah.
5793680	5796720	I want to be a good person and I want...
5796720	5797720	Here's some.
5797720	5800640	Tradition, charity, power, faith.
5800640	5801640	I'm just listing them off.
5801680	5802920	I don't like the big idea.
5802920	5803920	Other people.
5803920	5804920	Redemption.
5804920	5807920	Creativity, friendship, aspiration, independence, fairness.
5807920	5810920	Rehabilitation over punishment.
5810920	5811920	Yep.
5811920	5814920	Well, you know, okay.
5814920	5822160	I think they could all fall under the masthead of justice, righteousness, whatever.
5822160	5823160	I mean, because these are ideals.
5823160	5826120	They're not necessarily reflective of what I end up doing.
5826120	5828280	It's what you aspire to, I guess, right?
5828280	5829280	Yeah.
5829280	5830680	I want to be known as a good guy.
5830800	5831800	Exactly.
5831800	5832800	When I'm dead.
5832800	5834440	That's exactly it.
5834440	5835440	Or I want to...
5835440	5836440	Yeah.
5836440	5837440	All right.
5837440	5838440	Bonds.
5838440	5839440	Okay.
5839440	5844440	I'm going to change mine from courage to purify.
5844440	5846160	Sure.
5846160	5847160	Like fire.
5847160	5848160	Yeah.
5848160	5849160	Exactly.
5849160	5850160	Bonds, like...
5850160	5854720	So bond is something that if it was taken away from you, you would...
5854720	5856160	It could also be a motivation.
5856160	5860240	Like this says, someone stole my precious instrument and someday I'll get it back.
5861240	5862240	That's a bard.
5863240	5864240	Potato farms.
5864240	5865240	Yeah.
5865240	5866240	Your potato farm.
5866240	5869760	I owe my guild a great debt for forging me into the person I am today.
5869760	5870760	Well, what about control?
5870760	5871760	Is that cheating?
5871760	5872760	Like...
5872760	5873760	Control over what?
5873760	5874760	Everything?
5874760	5875760	Well, control.
5875760	5876760	Because, I mean, for...
5876760	5879160	What have I been doing?
5879160	5880520	What's the potato farm really about?
5880520	5882880	It's not about my love of potatoes.
5882880	5884040	It's about me wanting...
5884040	5886560	My narrative, you know?
5886560	5891480	I don't want other people to be in charge of...
5891480	5892800	But that's too esoteric.
5892800	5895920	It should be something more like, my spurs.
5895920	5896920	My boots.
5896920	5897920	My pet cobra.
5897920	5902080	Part of it's supposed to be like a hook for your motivation.
5902080	5906640	So control could be something, but I think it also kind of can tend away from things
5906640	5908680	too.
5908680	5909680	That's English.
5909680	5913480	I'm just striking out today, huh?
5914000	5917040	Well, I'll put control freak under flaws.
5917040	5918040	Okay.
5918040	5919640	Yeah, yeah, that's good.
5919640	5922880	Or yeah, which doesn't mean controlling others necessarily.
5922880	5929440	It's just like very cautious to surrender control.
5929440	5930440	Yeah.
5930440	5936120	But like a bond is like, everything I do is for the common folk or I will do everything
5936120	5939240	to protect this house or something, you know?
5939240	5940240	Yeah.
5940240	5941240	Well, it could be...
5941240	5942240	Yeah.
5942240	5946600	It could be something to do with the church.
5946600	5951200	You want to maybe right the wrongs of the church or you never want to reflect the corruption
5951200	5953240	that you've seen in the church or something?
5953240	5956560	Like maybe my actual relationship with the silver flame, because even though I have a
5956560	5959960	bunch of problems with the way the church is run, but if anyone were to ever tell me,
5959960	5964120	like, you're a bad Catholic, like plain and simple, like it would drive me nuts, you know?
5964120	5965120	Right.
5965120	5970080	So it's like my bond with my God, you know, super important, doesn't necessarily mean
5970080	5973920	that if I get in a fight with the Pope, I'm going to be anything more than conflicted.
5973920	5974920	Right.
5974920	5980000	But when it really comes down to it, like, I really buy into this silver flame, Michigan.
5980000	5981000	Is there a...
5981000	5982000	Your personal relationship with the silver flame.
5982000	5983000	Because it's been so long, Dan.
5983000	5986920	Is there a part of your character that wants to be kind of reinstated in some way?
5986920	5989080	Or are you so outcast and so...
5989080	5990920	I think I want to be purified.
5990920	5991920	The church of the silver flame is...
5991920	5992920	I'm into purification.
5992920	5993920	Yeah.
5993920	5994920	Me too.
5994920	5998880	But like, yeah, I think that there's like stains on me that I don't think can be like
5998880	6007120	scrubbed clean, except by like extreme, like, you know, deeds of like righteousness and
6007120	6013800	then that's like something that would block out all the memories of me just being a flawed,
6013800	6018280	you know, fallible, terrible, like complicated, clumsy person.
6018280	6019280	Yeah.
6019280	6020280	Well, that's going to be a bond.
6020280	6023200	It's like a need to fix the sins of the past or something.
6023200	6024200	Yeah.
6024200	6025200	I said before, redemption.
6025200	6027200	Like reputation or?
6027200	6028200	Redemption.
6028200	6029200	Yeah.
6029200	6030200	All right.
6030200	6031200	Redemption.
6031200	6032200	It could be a sentence or anything too.
6032200	6033200	Redemption.
6033200	6034200	It just gets the concept across.
6034200	6035200	Redemption.
6035200	6036200	Redemption.
6036200	6037200	Okay.
6037200	6038720	It could even be redemption.
6038720	6041720	I wrote it down.
6041720	6042720	I'm just not going to remember it.
6042720	6046480	When I look at that and it says bonds, redemption, I'm not going to be like, oh yeah.
6046480	6047480	Yeah.
6047480	6048480	That's the thing.
6048480	6050760	A lot of these, they recommend like sentences that kind of have some flair that are kind
6050760	6051760	of like a taggable asset.
6051760	6052760	Yeah.
6052760	6053760	My bond says fire.
6053760	6058160	I know I like fire, but my bond has to be something more like what I'm bound to, right?
6058600	6060800	I mean, it's just what's important to you.
6060800	6061800	What drives you?
6061800	6066160	The things like you could, you could be adventuring because your little sister is poor.
6066160	6069720	And so you send all your treasure back home to make sure your family stays alive.
6069720	6070720	You know, that could be a bond.
6070720	6074960	I put redemption parentheses, the idea that it's possible that, that'll, that'll always
6074960	6075960	be right.
6075960	6076960	I think that's great.
6076960	6079960	Like, you know, we're all like, that's why all of our actions are so important.
6079960	6082440	Why are you looking at me?
6082440	6085840	Because you can't just love a horse so much that you join a cult.
6086840	6090040	That's the shit that makes me start a potato farm.
6090040	6091680	Like I'm like, what are we fucking doing?
6091680	6095040	We like, we spent the last six chapters like doing nonsense.
6095040	6099320	Like I'm just like, want to start fresh on a potato farm because I'm a control freak
6099320	6102480	that really believes that we could accomplish something if we tried to.
6102480	6106240	I don't want to, but I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to tell you guys.
6106240	6108800	Spencer, do you have my old, all my old stuff?
6108800	6109800	Yeah.
6109800	6110800	Give me that.
6110800	6115520	But after the show and I'll go back before the next show and I want to go back and reread
6115520	6116520	everything that I had.
6116520	6117520	Yeah.
6117520	6118960	Well, a lot of that's no longer relevant.
6118960	6119960	Right.
6119960	6122600	But there's some character stuff that I think, okay, yeah, no problem.
6122600	6123600	Like your notes and stuff.
6123600	6124600	Yeah.
6124600	6125600	Yeah.
6125600	6126600	Yeah.
6126600	6127600	I got all that.
6127600	6128600	Great.
6128600	6129600	Spencer, whatever happened to Patchen's gym?
6129600	6130600	That's a great question.
6130600	6135880	I want to say Patchen's was kidnapped by someone at the town.
6135880	6138480	And then, so I really can't remember.
6138480	6141920	And if anyone, I was going to ask if anyone can remember, but I feel like they'll fuck
6141920	6142920	it up.
6142920	6145160	So are we kind of just like scrubbing the slate here?
6145760	6147800	Like a race on the board and just starting.
6147800	6148800	It's like, no, no.
6148800	6149800	Yeah.
6149800	6150800	It is like a reboot.
6150800	6157600	It's like, you know, it's like, uh, we put blue contacts in, uh, it's kind of like Jessica
6157600	6158600	Alba's eyes.
6158600	6162600	I think it's more like universal had the rights to the whole canal.
6162600	6163600	Disney has the right.
6163600	6164600	Yeah.
6164600	6165600	It's like, it's like, Oh yeah.
6165600	6169800	Like, uh, we're switching from a shitty spider man's to the ones where he's just an Iron
6169800	6170800	Man Jr.
6170800	6171800	Right.
6171800	6174960	Like, yeah, I think, I think Patchen's gym got stolen.
6174960	6175960	I went to the town.
6175960	6177360	You guys went to the town to find it.
6177360	6181880	I don't think you found it unless did he, did they find it?
6181880	6182880	They did find it.
6182880	6187680	They found Patchen's gym, but then they didn't find Patchen's Patchen's disappeared.
6187680	6188680	Okay.
6188680	6189680	Great.
6189680	6190680	That's what I thought happened.
6190680	6191680	I feel like Patchen's run off.
6191680	6192680	No, I felt really fucked with me.
6192680	6196640	Like Patchen's was like, I don't need, I don't need, I don't want you guys to help me.
6196640	6199840	That's why he went to the town and you followed him to the town anyway.
6199840	6202560	And then he mysteriously disappeared.
6202760	6207240	Going forward, is there any of, is there any hangover from our previous quest that we still
6207240	6211040	feel that it's unfinished business or are we driving forward into new?
6211040	6212040	We'll find out.
6212040	6213040	Yeah.
6213040	6216960	I mean, the, the, the, the ghosts of your past might come, might come back, but I don't
6216960	6221320	think you care about it too much because it's been, you've spent a lot of time committing
6221320	6222320	to farming.
6222320	6223320	Okay.
6223320	6224320	We fucking, we suck.
6224320	6225320	Yeah.
6225320	6226320	We're terrible at this.
6226320	6227320	And then now we're.
6227320	6229080	Think about it like the fifth Tomb Raider movie.
6229080	6230080	There is one.
6230080	6231080	It's not called Tomb Raider five.
6231240	6235320	They don't want you to watch the first four.
6235320	6237160	Is there going to be some shit in the first four?
6237160	6238160	I see.
6238160	6241760	Maybe if you're a huge Tomb Raider movie fan, you're like, Oh, that's the, we're not answering
6241760	6243680	any questions from the previous Tomb Raider.
6243680	6245600	We're just, we're just reading another tomb.
6245600	6246600	More or less.
6246600	6247600	Okay.
6247600	6248840	There were some big unanswered questions though.
6248840	6255040	Like we, one of the first villains we fought was going to be like probably a big bad, they
6255040	6256440	destroyed the church basement.
6256440	6257440	I forgot about it.
6257440	6259040	They were eating cows and stuff like that.
6259040	6263880	And there was like a ho-oh kind of like flying in the air, that big evil demon.
6263880	6264880	Yeah.
6264880	6265880	That was great, huh?
6265880	6266880	Yeah.
6266880	6268720	There was, there was a lot of setup happening.
6268720	6274280	We spent our whole time just beating up a family that had nothing to do with anything.
6274280	6275280	It was cool though.
6275280	6276280	I like it.
6276280	6277280	Yeah.
6277280	6278280	Um, yeah.
6278280	6279280	Anyway, sorry about all that.
6279280	6280280	No, no, it's good.
6280280	6281720	We start, we start afresh.
6281720	6284280	It's going to be, it's going to be some serious D&D.
6284280	6285280	We have new character sheets.
6285280	6286280	I'm very excited.
6286280	6287520	I like that on my extra notes.
6287520	6289280	It just says, eat my ass.
6289280	6290280	Exclamation point.
6290280	6291280	Yeah.
6291280	6292280	You, I didn't write that.
6292280	6293280	You wrote that.
6293280	6294280	I guess I did.
6294280	6295280	I don't know why.
6295280	6296280	Okay.
6296280	6297280	So let's talk about group inventory, Spencer.
6297280	6298280	Group inventory.
6298280	6301920	So I, one of the things I figured out was that, well, I used to give Steve the group
6301920	6305840	inventory sheet because I thought he was the most responsible, but then I was like, well,
6305840	6309340	no, everyone should have the group inventory sheet and then they'll know what they all have
6309340	6310340	on them.
6310340	6311640	So it's like your collected wealth.
6311640	6314400	And then the idea was you, you wanted to become farmers.
6314400	6318640	So if you ever wanted to like sell your stuff to buy farm equipment, it would be, it would
6318640	6322760	be helpful to know like your, your, all the stuff that you could sell and all the wealth
6322760	6325320	you had, because it's not on your character sheet.
6325320	6326320	Where is that on this?
6326320	6327600	I don't see farmer equipment.
6327600	6328600	You don't have any.
6328600	6329600	Okay.
6329600	6330600	We're grassroots.
6330600	6334440	I mean, you might have a couple of shovels and stuff, but you haven't really bought a
6334440	6335440	lot of farm equipment.
6335440	6337040	I think you just bought some potato seeds.
6337040	6340040	So under groups own gear, you have a little bracket here.
6340040	6342080	We have a bow.
6342080	6343640	Yeah.
6343640	6344640	That's your own stuff.
6344640	6345640	That's like stuff.
6345640	6348920	If you wanted, if you, for instance, want to commit to farming so hard, you sold all
6348920	6350120	your weapons and armor.
6350120	6353480	That stuff's on your group inventory sheet and it has like monetary value.
6353480	6355040	Like you could sell your boat for two gold.
6355040	6356040	I dig it.
6356040	6357040	Okay.
6357040	6358040	And what are the relics?
6358040	6359040	Are these important anymore?
6359040	6360040	They're just items you have.
6360040	6362240	I mean, I don't know the, the, the relics or relics.
6362240	6364080	You never discovered what they were.
6364080	6367220	They were just something you picked up and forgot about because it was on Steve's group
6367220	6368220	inventory.
6368220	6369960	We have a hundred pounds of beef jerky.
6369960	6370960	Yeah.
6370960	6371960	It was in a bag.
6371960	6372960	Does that expire?
6372960	6373960	No, it's beef jerky.
6373960	6374960	No, it's dried for a reason.
6374960	6375960	I don't know.
6375960	6378280	I've had some gross old beef jerky.
6378280	6380000	I've had some moldy beef jerky.
6380000	6381440	Oh, don't break it up.
6381440	6382440	Is it sensitive?
6382440	6386040	Sensitive spot for this audience.
6386040	6387040	There's beef.
6387040	6388040	Good times.
6388040	6389040	Beef fungus.
6389040	6390040	Good times.
6390040	6391040	Oh man, remember that.
6391040	6392040	Yeah.
6392040	6393040	Classic.
6393040	6394680	If he's listening, he's going to blow his brains out.
6394680	6395680	That could be funny.
6395680	6398040	No, that would not be funny.
6398040	6399040	Hello, William.
6399040	6400040	We love you.
6400040	6401040	Yeah, yeah.

6404040	6405040	Yeah, bag of holding.
6405040	6408280	You stole it from that guy who is the mayor of Fightsville.
6408280	6409440	One poison pill.
6409440	6410440	Yep.
6410440	6415000	You stole that off of an assassin who, that was the assassin who took Patchen's gem.
6415000	6416000	He didn't take it.
6416000	6417000	A different one did.
6417000	6418160	Black dragon shards.
6418160	6419400	That was also on the assassin.
6419400	6420720	You didn't know what that did.
6420720	6421720	Right.
6421720	6422720	But you could find out.
6422720	6423720	Dig it.
6423720	6425000	Two masterwork daggers.
6425000	6426920	Those are more expensive than regular daggers.
6426920	6428600	Those are also owned by the assassins.
6428600	6429600	Okay.
6429600	6431960	These are all like company stuff.
6431960	6432960	We all have together.
6432960	6433960	Yeah.
6433960	6437040	It's treasure you found, but didn't decide to split up amongst yourself and physically.
6437040	6439800	How are we toting all this about with our hundred pounds of beef jerky?
6439800	6441720	It's in your closet, in your farm.
6441720	6442720	Okay.
6442720	6443720	So we have a home base.
6443720	6445680	Oh, but the beef jerky is in a magical bag of holding.
6445680	6449080	It doesn't, you don't have to, it's a, oh, could this all be in the bag of holding?
6449080	6450080	Sure.
6450080	6451080	Yeah.
6451080	6452080	All right.
6452080	6453080	So we have all this.
6453080	6455720	So we have 18 gold pieces, including something else.
6455720	6457320	This is the real D and D man.
6457320	6460080	Not all this fucking like these and vows.
6460080	6461080	Yeah.
6461080	6462080	It's just gritty.
6462080	6463080	What's in my bag?
6463080	6464080	Just inventory man.
6464080	6465080	Yeah.
6465080	6466080	We have masterwork leather armor.
6466080	6467080	I like, I like that.
6467080	6468520	We've got to also off the assassins.
6468520	6469520	We've got more gold pieces.
6469520	6470520	We've got a bag of holding.
6470520	6471520	We got beef jerky.
6471520	6474880	We've got what's SP, SP silver pieces.
6474880	6475880	They're like dimes.
6475880	6477080	You gotcha.
6477080	6479360	And two more religious relics.
6479360	6480360	Right.
6480360	6481360	Okay.
6481360	6482360	And then what do those look like?
6482360	6483360	Describe the religious relics.
6483360	6488120	There's statues of, of gods, like, uh, of Pelor icons.
6488120	6489120	Yeah.
6489120	6490120	Okay.
6490120	6491120	All right.
6491120	6492720	I guess not Pelor, whatever.
6492720	6493720	It's Pelor.
6493720	6494720	Okay.
6494720	6497680	Well, I picked my spell loadout.
6497680	6498880	Aha.
6498880	6499880	Spell cards.
6499880	6501800	I love this card system.
6501800	6503360	I think it's good.
6503360	6505360	Read read what you picked.
6505360	6510680	We get, uh, how many are we, are we, are we have every day six, six right now until you
6510680	6511680	level up.
6511680	6512680	Yeah.
6512680	6514120	Do you want me to pick how many more?
6514120	6517960	Well you get the, you get your cantrips and your, your, your bonus spells from your circle
6517960	6518960	and your domain.
6518960	6519960	All right.
6519960	6520960	This is all esoteric.
6520960	6524120	I say I'm, I'm into this kind of paperwork shit.
6524120	6525120	I love this.
6525120	6526120	I know you guys are.
6526120	6527120	It's great.
6527120	6528120	The cards are helpful to me.
6528120	6529720	I, I really was hoping they'd be helpful.
6529720	6530720	All right.
6530720	6532360	So Dan, read what you picked.
6532360	6536640	So let's let everybody know what, what, uh, well the spells I have automatically.
6536640	6538160	Carlos has come in.
6538160	6540200	Our light guidance.
6540200	6542240	It's guidance.
6542240	6546480	To touch one willing creature once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d four
6546480	6548720	and add the number rolled to one ability.
6548720	6549720	Check of its choice.
6549720	6550720	A bonus.
6550720	6551720	A bonus is an action.
6551720	6552720	Just a little buffy, buffy thing.
6552720	6553720	A little buff.
6553720	6555600	Um, sacred flame.
6555600	6559040	That's like an attack, uh, burning hands.
6559040	6560040	That's classic.
6560040	6569240	We know that one, player's handbook, uh, fairy fire, the, uh, what's very fine.
6569240	6573360	And, uh, it puts, it puts magical lights around someone who's invisible or dimly lit
6573360	6580280	and it makes them easier to hit, uh, scorching ray, blast some fire missiles.
6580280	6581880	That's going to see some mileage.
6581880	6585440	Um, so then those are, those are all the ones that I have regardless.
6585440	6586440	Right.
6586440	6594360	Um, and then I chose as my level one spells of which I get four, create or destroy water,
6594360	6598440	collect magic, inflict wounds and cure wounds.
6598440	6603880	Uh, and as my level two spells of which I get two, I chose zone of truth.
6603880	6608280	You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15 foot radius, blah, blah,
6608280	6609840	blah, and hold the person.
6609840	6612000	That's like kind of a paralysis thing.
6612000	6613000	Yeah.
6613000	6614000	Paralyzes a dude.
6614000	6615000	Yeah.
6615000	6616000	Yeah.
6616000	6617000	I know.
6617000	6620520	Cody, Cody, Cody's doctor's name.
6620520	6623920	She thought, she thought her doctor's name, she had her, she had a physical.
6624480	6626040	She just got a clean mammogram today.
6626040	6627240	I think we celebrate that.
6627240	6628240	Hell yeah.
6628240	6634280	Props to God damn, you know, women, they gotta get their boobies mushed like by a cold thing.
6634280	6640360	I can't believe how painful that looks like, like, like, like they don't do that to your,
6640360	6646400	to your, uh, dick balls or like, like that is insane.
6646400	6652920	But anyways, she got, yeah, she's all clear and, uh, um, she thought her doctor's name
6652920	6658480	was, uh, Boonani, but it's like Boonini or something.
6658480	6660760	It's like you were thinking of Poonani anyways.
6660760	6661760	All right.
6661760	6668160	She's been calling her doctor, uh, Boonani in Iceland, the mammogram machines are warmed
6668160	6670680	so they're not ice cold.
6670680	6675240	I think it still mashes your tit, like it does, but it's got to be the worst part.
6675240	6677240	I don't know.
6677240	6680840	Oh, oh, oh, all right.
6680840	6687880	Oh, those, those precious boobies.
6687880	6689960	Number one killer of women, Jeff.
6689960	6690960	Boobs?
6690960	6691960	I guess.
6691960	6697400	I had drinks with Heather Ann Campbell, uh, who just survived, uh, uh, if you don't know
6697400	6701200	who Heather Ann Campbell is, she is one of our favorite comedians and she should come
6701200	6702200	on this show.
6702200	6703200	I, yeah.
6703200	6704200	She survived.
6704200	6708600	We were at, we were on at midnight, Chris Hardwick show with her, um, she's an improv
6708600	6712120	friend to Jeff's and like, she's just a spectacular person.
6712120	6714680	Had great, like it was great having drinks with her.
6714680	6720000	She's writing on that, uh, Twilight zone, Jordan Petal, Jordan Petal, uh, Twilight's
6720000	6721000	on show now.
6721000	6725120	And, uh, yeah, we just, we just wrapped and like, I wanted her on Rick and Wardy and,
6725120	6730360	but like, the Twilight zones just got their hooks in her and, um, but we talked about
6730360	6737200	video games and, and, and her survival of this fucking thing that also our other friend
6737200	6741120	Angela Trimber, like, uh, I, which I didn't even know until I talked to Heather.
6741120	6743880	I was like, oh shit, I didn't follow Angela on Instagram.
6743880	6753360	Like it's like, and then I, I saw Angela at a party two nights ago and, uh, I was like,
6753360	6760160	it's crazy how little time it takes between diagnosis and like, it's either you're either
6760160	6762360	fucked or it's over.
6762360	6766640	It's like depending on the process and stuff, it's like for, for, for Heather.
6766640	6774400	It was like, she, she got this result that was like, you're in the cross hairs of God.
6774400	6778080	And then it was like a month and a half later, you're like, you're done with this.
6778080	6782080	You know, it's just like, like how quickly that happens.
6782080	6787040	It's like, like a bus just coming out of nowhere and it either kills you or you, or it just
6787040	6788040	wings you.
6788040	6789040	All right.
6789040	6790040	Anyways.
6790040	6793760	Well, let's give it up for Heather for making it through that.
6793760	6794760	She's a hero.
6794760	6801720	I was only on one at midnight and it was with you and Heather and I had more fun doing
6801720	6805840	that than any other half hour taping of my life because we just laughed our asses off
6805840	6806840	the entire time.
6806840	6807840	We did two of them.
6807840	6810080	I did one.
6810080	6811080	That sounds right.
6811080	6812080	We did two.
6812080	6813080	It was you, me and Brandon.
6813080	6814080	It was the other one.
6814080	6815080	Right.
6815080	6816080	No, I only did one with you and Heather.
6816080	6817080	Oh, okay.
6817080	6818080	All right.
6818080	6819080	Yeah.
6819080	6820080	Wow.
6820080	6824240	I mean, how do we, uh, how do we continue after that?
6825200	6827680	We don't pack it in.
6827680	6829320	What, what, what time is it?
6829320	6830320	It's 10.
6830320	6831320	Oh yeah.
6831320	6836520	I mean, I mean, it's, yeah, we're close to, uh, do a rap.
6836520	6837520	All right.

6857440	6858440	Yo.
6858440	6859440	I guess it's not.
6859440	6862440	It didn't go over well.
6862440	6876000	This song's about eating pussy, but not yours.
6876000	6877000	Someone else's.
6877000	6878000	Yo.
6878560	6881680	I ate someone else's pussy the other day.
6881680	6884160	I ate it in the most unusual way.
6884160	6886640	I ate it like it was corn on the cob.
6886640	6890000	I'm a pussy eating Cajun Southern snob.
6890000	6892720	I like my spices and my pussy.

6914320	6919080	that you already like, but then you won't be allowed there anymore because you came
