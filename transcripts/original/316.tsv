0	5000	From the DINATAP stream of capital doodles, it's...
7000	9000	Harmon Town is now in session.
15000	19000	Let's welcome out our Game Master, Spencer Crittenden, everybody please.
24000	27000	What you got in that bag?
27000	32000	Oh, school supplies and pencil shavings.
32000	36000	Let's bring out a mayor, shall we? His name is Dan Harmon.
45000	46000	Oh boy.
47000	48000	Happy New Year.
49000	54000	It's good to be back. I really missed you guys. We missed each other. I miss doing this.
54000	55000	Yay.
55000	58000	Oh, I'm sorry. No, keep the beat going.
60000	65000	I really missed doing this as much as your mom has missed.
65000	67000	Now cut the beat off, cut the beat off.
67000	68000	Okay.
68000	71000	Wait, bring the beat back, bring the beat back.
76000	79000	Yeah, do it more like an Iron Maiden, more like Rock and Roll.
84000	90000	Power from the devil when I eat your pussy.
91000	102000	I couldn't be more masculine than I am in the eyes of the awesome boy when I eat your pussy.
103000	104000	Pussy.
104000	108000	The section of the abdomen that is located...
108000	110000	Get out of here, egghead.
110000	111000	I'm sorry.
111000	114000	I'm pushing.
114000	116000	You invited me to the recording.
116000	120000	Just get out of here. I want to eat pussy.
121000	124000	Now does the ice tea like a fill in my feet?
124000	131000	Hey, it's not business. It's personal when I eat your pussy business.
131000	133000	Come on, knock it off.
134000	138000	What does MC Gun Control think about eating pussy?
139000	141000	Yo, you got the control.
141000	142000	Yeah, no, I'm sorry.
142000	143000	Yeah.
144000	146000	All right, welcome back, everybody.
146000	148000	God damn it.
148000	151000	Like, you know, all the fantasies you have in your head of like,
151000	153000	let's start doing the podcast again.
153000	158000	That just all goes to shit in the first five seconds.
159000	160000	Do this, do that.
160000	162000	Well, now we did it. Now it's all...
162000	164000	I'm back to being jaded again.
164000	165000	Oh, no.
165000	166000	Yeah, thank you.
166000	167000	I got engaged.
168000	169000	Yeah.
172000	173000	It's so cool.
173000	176000	I had always said, you know, obviously, as a divorcee,
176000	178000	like a lot of you kids can't relate to this.
178000	182000	Like, I'm sure there are a ton of people in the theater
182000	184000	that are on their third marriage.
184000	186000	It's LA, after all.
186000	188000	And I endorse you.
188000	191000	Like, I think, like, use marriage as an expression.
191000	193000	Like, express yourself.
193000	196000	Like, let me see what you do on your eighth marriage.
197000	200000	But I think the typical person is like, no, marriage is for keeps
200000	203000	and that's why I hate it or I love it or whatever.
203000	206000	I never saw myself as a divorcee.
206000	208000	I loved my wife.
208000	211000	Like, I proposed to my lovely, lovely wife,
211000	213000	my partner, my best friend.
213000	217000	We were together for a probably record minimum amount of time
217000	219000	before we were like, whoa, mistake.
220000	224000	And, but I always, I was like, I would say to Cody, like,
224000	227000	look, you want to put a ring on this finger, like, do it.
227000	230000	But the one thing I can't do is be like,
230000	232000	will you also marry me?
233000	235000	That seems problematic.
235000	239000	Because it's like the proposal is coming from the one guy that's like,
239000	243000	look, you're already established that your opinion of who should be married
243000	245000	is flawed.
246000	249000	Is this logic not tracking?
250000	253000	Like, don't get married and then get divorced.
253000	255000	My therapist said the same thing, which is not really,
255000	258000	because it's disrespecting your cut.
258000	262000	But I'm like, well, no, fucking you got to do it this time.
262000	265000	But Cody proposed to you on this one, right?
265000	266000	That's what I'm saying.
266000	267000	Yeah.
267000	268000	Is that I'm like, yeah, I'll hold out for that.
268000	271000	Does she like get down on the knee and do the whole thing?
271000	273000	Yeah, she did. She almost drowned.
274000	278000	Because it was in Tahini and she picked her spot and she did the thing
278000	281000	and she had rehearsed it and she was up to her neck in water
281000	283000	and she proposed to me.
283000	286000	I knew it was coming eventually, but I didn't know it was coming there.
287000	289000	Are you going to take the name Heller or are you going to keep Harmon?
289000	291000	I think I would.
291000	295000	Selfishly, I would like to take the name Heller because I would like to die.
297000	299000	I've been through this whole thing.
300000	303000	I consider this very therapeutic.
303000	307000	A woman got down on her knee and said,
312000	313000	would you marry me?
313000	315000	And I was like, only fuck.
315000	316000	I knew this was happening.
316000	318000	I knew this was happening.
318000	320000	And then I'm like, holy shit, it's happening now.
320000	325000	And then I'm like, honestly, to be honest and share with you,
325000	327000	this is not a binary decision you make.
327000	329000	However, it gets reduced.
329000	334000	If somebody says to you at the halftime show of a thing,
334000	337000	you're like, the alternative is, no, I won't marry you.
337000	340000	There's a little bit of a push there where you're like,
340000	343000	yeah, of course, first and foremost, yes and.
343000	347000	But there's a processor in the back of your head where you're like,
347000	349000	what's happening? How is this going to work?
349000	353000	So your UCB training kicked in at this point?
353000	356000	I think everyone's UCB training kicks in.
356000	358000	Everyone doesn't need UCB training.
358000	361000	That was the start of a thing in my Tahitian vacation
361000	364000	where I was like, in the background, I didn't share this with Cody at all.
364000	365000	I shared it with my therapist.
365000	369000	But I was like, every day since I said yes to this proposal,
369000	372000	I had been confronting this anxiety.
372000	376000	Or I was like, a woman just proposed to you.
376000	378000	And you said yes.
378000	380000	And what have you given up?
380000	382000	What are you doing? What's going on?
382000	387000	And it made me kind of like go through these thoughts in my head
387000	391000	where I was like, well, first of all, now I can get as fat as I want.
391000	395000	But then counter that, I was like, no, you now have to get thinner
395000	398000	than you've ever been.
398000	401000	There's a voice from down here somewhere where I'm like,
401000	403000	he's not saying anything that I disagree with,
403000	410000	but your license to speak is too liberal.
410000	414000	Curtail it. It's distracting me.
414000	417000	But even though you're saying exactly everything I'm thinking,
417000	420000	fuck you, silence.
420000	425000	Free speech zone is in my butt.
425000	428000	Get up my butt, sir.
428000	431000	I started thinking in my head, it was like an emotional thing
431000	435000	where I was like, oh shit, when a guy proposes to a woman,
435000	439000	the guy, it doesn't matter, remove all of your politics
439000	442000	about who pays for what and all this stuff.
442000	446000	The bottom line is that a guy is thinking about it
446000	450000	and then buying a ring, which is what Cody had to do,
450000	455000	and it's just that power of when you hit the buzzer.
455000	457000	I knew Cody was going to propose to me.
457000	459000	I was in love with her. I wanted her to propose to me.
459000	462000	I didn't know it was going to happen then, but that makes it no...
463000	469000	She gets to hit the buzzer in the game show of we're married now.
469000	472000	She told me. She's like, should I?
472000	476000	I don't want to hear that you got to weigh in. That's awful.
476000	478000	I told her don't do it.
478000	480000	Okay. All right.
480000	486000	And I was like, there was this thing of anxiety hanging over me.
486000	488000	I don't know how much of it had to do with the fact that,
488000	490000	look, I've been married and I fucked it up.
490000	493000	What do you have proposed to her if she hadn't done it?
493000	495000	Well, I don't know if I would have.
495000	498000	I told her, I told everybody within shouting range.
498000	504000	I was like, look, I love marriage, so I proposed to my ex-wife.
504000	506000	It didn't work out so good.
506000	510000	Therefore, what right do I have to...
510000	512000	It felt like...
512000	517000	It's like, what does it mean for me to get on one knee and say,
517000	520000	hey, you know what?
520000	523000	I got a feeling this one's...
523000	527000	It's sort of like, to me, there's an elephant in that room where it's like,
527000	529000	yeah, but what do you know?
529000	531000	You're divorced.
531000	535000	You're the one guy in this exchange that doesn't know whether or not
535000	537000	you should be proposing to someone.
537000	538000	You already did it.
538000	542000	And it was always an open joke between me and Cody because she's...
542000	544000	And she's like, what if I ever proposed to you?
544000	547000	The day you proposed to me, you'd give a fucking automatic yes.
547000	548000	I love you.
548000	550000	I want to be with you for the rest of my life.
550000	554000	And that's sort of what all couples are, in a sense.
554000	555000	It's not like...
555000	559000	Hopefully, there's not a lot of couples where someone's like, by the way,
559000	564000	a shitter get off the pot and it's like, oh, fuck, oh, God.
564000	567000	We perceive it that way, but the truth is that you're like,
567000	569000	it's more of a continuum.
569000	572000	And so that's why...
572000	576000	Of course I said yes, because of course the answer is yes.
576000	579000	And then for the next two days, unbeknownst to Cody,
579000	580000	I was sort of like...
580000	584000	In my head, it was like, why do I feel uneasy?
584000	587000	And the answer is, because this wasn't...
587000	591000	I'm missing the way you miss your wallet or your keys.
591000	594000	I'm missing my agency.
594000	597000	It's not like this isn't what I wanted.
597000	600000	It's just that I didn't...
600000	602000	I've been shocked, like corn,
602000	605000	of something that doesn't protect me anyway.
605000	606000	It doesn't matter.
606000	608000	I didn't want it, but I was like, it's gone.
608000	611000	I didn't even know I wanted it.
611000	613000	And then I started to think in my head.
613000	616000	It was like, why don't you run through some exercises?
616000	618000	Like, what's your worst nightmare?
618000	622000	It was like, okay, well, I've been taken.
622000	626000	So it's my job to serve this woman for the rest of my life.
626000	629000	And that actually kind of made me start...
629000	631000	I was thinking in my head, it was like,
631000	633000	what if you were property?
633000	635000	What if you had been taken?
635000	636000	What if you had no agency?
636000	640000	What if somebody had looked at you and said, I want that?
640000	645000	And you were like, okay, I'll let you take that.
645000	647000	And I don't want you to leave me,
647000	651000	so I guess I'd better be on my toes from now on.
651000	655000	As opposed to this other...
655000	658000	I wonder if any woman here could relate to that feeling.
658000	661000	That's my point, is I was sort of like in doses,
661000	664000	I was sort of like subjecting myself.
664000	667000	And the more I pushed the weird dystopian narrative,
667000	671000	where it was like, what if you actually were just a slave?
671000	673000	What if you were a servant?
673000	674000	What is your nightmare?
674000	675000	What is the worst thing?
675000	678000	What do we fear about...
678000	680000	What do these symbols represent?
680000	683000	Ring on your finger, like ring on my finger.
683000	684000	I'm doing this.
684000	685000	I take that.
685000	686000	My father pays for this.
686000	688000	He gives you away.
688000	691000	All this transactional stuff.
691000	695000	And then thinking about my part of it
695000	699000	and going, what if I was a damsel?
699000	700000	What if I...
700000	702000	It came out...
702000	703000	I liked it.
703000	710000	I was like, oh, this is the good side of the equality thing.
710000	714000	Yeah, fucking, I don't want to deal with this shit.
714000	716000	Doesn't every guy want...
716000	720000	Aren't incels complaining about...
720000	725000	How come women aren't just giving me sex?
725000	728000	Do you think they'd be happy if we lived in a world
728000	732000	where women could walk up to them and go, you, incel.
732000	734000	I choose you.
734000	736000	I like your cheekbones.
736000	738000	Can you make breakfast?
739000	742000	Would they be willing to meet them halfway a little bit?
742000	746000	Because according to their website, no, they don't.
746000	748000	They want a world where women are...
748000	750000	You can get them in the mail and stuff.
750000	753000	But somewhere in the middle there is a partnership
753000	755000	where it's like, oh, me?
755000	758000	Which I really like that feeling.
758000	760000	All right, let's move on to something else.
760000	762000	Thank you for congratulating me on my engagement.
762000	764000	Happy 2019.
765000	770000	Yes, I will take her name
770000	773000	because I kind of don't like Dan Harmon anymore.
773000	775000	It won't be because I'm a feminist.
775000	777000	It'll be because I don't like myself.
777000	780000	It'll be me conveniently going like,
780000	782000	oh, that guy that sexually harass that lady
782000	785000	and apologize for it on NPR, he's dead.
785000	787000	I'll just be like, Dan Heller's in the house.
787000	790000	I kind of like that idea of being like,
790000	792000	let's call it Hellertown and let's...
793000	796000	You won't have to change your monogram on your towels.
796000	797000	It's the same...
797000	798000	Still DH.
798000	799000	Still DH.
799000	800000	The people that really respect me
800000	802000	have only ever called me DH.
802000	803000	Yeah.
803000	805000	That's the bottom line.
805000	807000	When you see Judd Apatow walking down the road,
807000	809000	you go, hey, DH.
809000	811000	He gets it.
813000	816000	Wait, so do you guys think you're gonna get married?
816000	818000	No, she's so lazy.
818000	821000	It'll be a million years.
821000	824000	She was so excited about proposing to a guy
824000	826000	and making him, like, she'll be...
826000	827000	I bet.
827000	828000	I was...
828000	829000	I was...
829000	830000	I'll be honest.
830000	833000	I was stunned by the feminist triumph.
833000	835000	I was really taken aback.
835000	836000	That's all she wanted.
836000	837000	She's done.
837000	838000	That's the thing.
838000	839000	It really...
839000	841000	I was like, I don't even know how to feel about this.
841000	843000	Now, if we get married, do you wanna...
843000	845000	Yeah, it'll be five years from now.
845000	846000	It was awesome.
846000	847000	Rob Schwab will be officiating.
847000	849000	We'll be in Death Valley between two rocks.
850000	851000	There'll be eight people there.
851000	853000	What if you guys love each other so much
853000	856000	that you just name each other Schwab?
857000	860000	You become Dan and Cody Schwab.
861000	862000	I think it'll be good.
862000	864000	Yeah, I am...
864000	865000	Prove your love.
865000	866000	Prove your love.
866000	868000	I would love to prove my love.
868000	870000	Okay, let's talk about some stuff.
870000	871000	Happy New Year.
871000	872000	It's been such a long time.
872000	873000	Okay.
875000	878000	A loud sneezing family on boat.
879000	881000	That sounds like a hot one.
881000	882000	Let's start with that one.
882000	883000	Let's go in.
883000	884000	I wanna hear about that.
884000	889000	Okay, there was a fucking insanely loud sneezing family on...
889000	892000	As we came back from Tahiti, like, we went to this island.
892000	893000	It...
893000	895000	Like, we got on the return boat.
895000	897000	Like, you gotta go back to the...
897000	898000	It's time...
898000	899000	Your dream is over.
899000	900000	It's time to stop.
900000	902000	You gotta go back home now.
902000	905000	And so you're getting back on the boat, and it's just like...
905000	908000	And you're back on the boat with whoever's...
908000	909000	Whoever else's dream has expired.
909000	911000	And there was this family.
911000	913000	And they're just like...
913000	915000	They were from Dallas.
915000	916000	I gleaned that.
916000	918000	But it's like, Cody was like, what?
918000	919000	How?
919000	923000	Like, what is the point of a sneeze if you haven't sneezed it yet?
923000	925000	Because there was this, like, this person back there.
925000	926000	We didn't...
926000	927000	And they were just like...
927000	928000	Hadja!
928000	929000	Hadja!
929000	930000	Hadja!
930000	931000	They were just sneezing so much.
931000	935000	And the only funny part of the story is that we went through what we perceived as this
935000	936000	whole, like, journey.
936000	939000	We were like, we're trying to get back home.
939000	942000	And Americans are...
942000	946000	You know, I experienced just a small taste of, like...
946000	951000	I think we're a little privileged because we were in the middle of, like, a part...
951000	957000	The navel of the world where, like, the English is not exactly like the...
957000	961000	It's not like everyone's panicking if they don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
961000	967000	Where it's like, I don't think I've ever traveled outside of the American hegemony.
967000	975000	And going to Tahiti, you kind of enter a French hegemony where, like, it's like, look, everyone
975000	978000	speaks English, we get it, but...
978000	985000	And the truth is, like, I am a property of French hegemony, so I have a French accent,
985000	990000	and I will speak to you in French because you're, like, this first world person.
990000	996000	If you're like, I don't know French, you're like, can I play Minecraft in my room?
996000	999000	And they're like, who the fuck are you? You're a monster.
999000	1003000	Like, the airports are, like, speaking French over speakers.
1003000	1005000	Imagine that nightmare.
1005000	1006000	Yeah.
1006000	1007000	And you're like...
1007000	1009000	Imagine an airport that didn't speak English.
1009000	1010000	Unbelievable.
1010000	1012000	I'm like...
1012000	1014000	I was like, holy shit.
1014000	1019000	No wonder everyone just crowds the gate instead of letting me take my first class seat.
1019000	1025000	The reason I bring it up is because there was this family that, like, foot on the bone,
1025000	1028000	they're just like, hot shoe! Hot shoe! Hot shoe!
1028000	1030000	This guy was, like, kept sneezing.
1030000	1034000	And Cody and I are, like, going through all this shit, and we're like, I can't...
1034000	1037000	I don't know, like, whatever. It's all good.
1037000	1039000	Like, I don't know what's happening.
1039000	1040000	They called my name.
1040000	1042000	Did you ever get your name called at an airport?
1042000	1043000	Terrifying.
1044000	1047000	I'm sorry. You're very excited. You're like...
1047000	1050000	No. Nobody's name is... All right.
1052000	1053000	Happened to me once.
1053000	1054000	Did you ever...
1054000	1055000	Scary.
1055000	1056000	When I was traveling with you guys...
1056000	1058000	Spencer Crittenden, will you come up and...
1058000	1060000	Mr. Crittenden, report to the thing for whatever.
1060000	1062000	And you're like, aren't you thinking, like...
1062000	1063000	I gotta run.
1063000	1064000	Oh, my God.
1064000	1065000	I gotta get out of here.
1065000	1066000	Oh, my God. Let me... Oh, my God.
1066000	1069000	Like, I'm interfering with the operation of a fucking thing.
1069000	1070000	Push over several people.
1070000	1074000	So, like, now imagine, like, a...
1074000	1075000	French.
1075000	1076000	Like, a French airport.
1076000	1077000	Right.
1077000	1078000	Oh, no.
1080000	1085000	I just don't know where the parody begins and the satire ends.
1085000	1088000	I... Just keep... Just button it up.
1088000	1091000	You're like a ventriloquist dummy in a Twilight Zone movie.
1091000	1094000	I don't know... Am I supposed to throw you across the room?
1097000	1099000	Is it gonna turn out that I was you the whole time?
1100000	1102000	Just... Just take it easy.
1102000	1105000	Just... Just watch. Just watch.
1105000	1106000	And just take it easy.
1106000	1108000	No one can hear what you're referring to.
1109000	1110000	Oh, really? Is it?
1110000	1111000	Yeah. No.
1111000	1114000	Okay. Well, there's a guy in the first row that keeps saying things that are not...
1114000	1115000	No, I'm joking.
1115000	1116000	They're fine. Like, I'll go...
1116000	1117000	No one likes it.
1117000	1118000	Hey, I don't get shoes.
1118000	1120000	And I'll be like, the left one or the right one?
1120000	1121000	All right.
1121000	1124000	So, there's a voice.
1124000	1125000	It's like... It's like...
1126000	1128000	I'm so confused.
1135000	1136000	And I'm like... Oh, my...
1138000	1141000	Jeff did a thing. Five dollars.
1143000	1146000	No, but that's so terrifying. It's in another language.
1146000	1148000	All right. Well, obviously...
1148000	1150000	Wait. So, what happened? I'm sorry.
1150000	1153000	No, you can't. What are you doing? What are you doing?
1154000	1156000	I was creating magical comedy.
1156000	1158000	What are you doing here, kid?
1158000	1159000	Jeff Davis.
1159000	1162000	I'm trying to connect with people.
1162000	1166000	You're doing great. You're doing admirably, given the circumstances.
1166000	1168000	Don't you think I'm up against shit tonight?
1168000	1173000	I know you're... Every Monday night, you're absolutely up against shit.
1173000	1177000	Probably other nights, too, but definitely Monday nights. I'm seeing it right now.
1177000	1178000	Probably, yeah.
1178000	1179000	Yeah.
1179000	1182000	You're in a French airport. A French-controlled airport.
1182000	1183000	In the middle of a...
1185000	1187000	Dan Harmon? Dan Harmon?
1187000	1188000	It's scary.
1188000	1190000	It's so hard to...
1190000	1193000	I'm getting through. I go up to the counter.
1193000	1195000	Cody's back there. They called my name.
1195000	1197000	My name's never been called.
1197000	1199000	I always thought that when they called your name,
1199000	1202000	it was because you weren't there for something
1202000	1203000	or you were going to lose your seat.
1203000	1206000	It got all the way up to the counter.
1207000	1212000	The amount of people whose lives I impinged upon...
1212000	1215000	Bags hitting babies' heads.
1215000	1218000	Because I'm like, I don't understand.
1218000	1221000	Everyone's standing. They're just standing
1221000	1225000	because all they know is that the people are speaking in French,
1225000	1228000	and what they're saying is that the plane's going to take off,
1228000	1232000	and so everyone's just compressed like a fucking Lego sculpture.
1233000	1237000	And so you have to actively mush through that
1237000	1240000	if they go like, Dan Harmon? Dan Harmon?
1240000	1242000	And I'm like, I can't...
1242000	1246000	I have no choice. I would never do this to anyone.
1246000	1249000	I ran my American Express card.
1249000	1251000	Nay. My assistant did.
1251000	1254000	I don't... I did this...
1254000	1258000	I subscribed to a tier of human experience
1258000	1260000	that doesn't involve me ever touching you
1260000	1262000	or you touching me.
1262000	1265000	I am trying to bustle...
1265000	1269000	Every single human being has a right to look at you like,
1269000	1273000	what are you doing, you horrible ferret?
1273000	1276000	Why are you fucking mushing me
1276000	1279000	and touching my child's head?
1279000	1282000	And I'm like, I just want to say to all of them,
1282000	1284000	I don't want to do this.
1284000	1287000	They called my name at the desk
1287000	1290000	that says whether you can get on the plane or not.
1290000	1292000	And I'm just like, oh, excuse him.
1292000	1297000	Mwah! Sifu plays about your baby's head
1297000	1299000	and you're like, I'm sorry.
1299000	1301000	And someone took a shit on the floor
1301000	1302000	and it said, because...
1302000	1305000	And they get all the way up to the thing and they're like,
1305000	1308000	uh, I said, you called my name.
1308000	1310000	Uh, Monsieur Harmon?
1310000	1313000	Yeah. And they're like, eh, just checking.
1313000	1315000	Uh...
1315000	1318000	For real. I swear to Christ.
1318000	1321000	They literally said, just checking.
1321000	1323000	Were they worried about you?
1323000	1326000	I don't fucking know! I'll never know!
1326000	1330000	Because as soon as they said it, I'm like, just checking?
1330000	1331000	I don't want to make...
1331000	1333000	I feel like Liam Neeson and taken,
1333000	1336000	I'm worried, is Cody part of a white slavery ring now?
1336000	1338000	I just left her.
1338000	1343000	You don't understand, these airports are un-American.
1344000	1347000	They're downright French.
1347000	1349000	You know, they...
1349000	1352000	Their toast is weird, even.
1352000	1355000	It's soft.
1355000	1358000	We like hard toast.
1364000	1367000	American toast, we call it.
1368000	1370000	I may never...
1370000	1373000	It's weird, it's like...
1373000	1375000	I love American toast.
1375000	1377000	I love it too.
1377000	1379000	One of that soft shit eggs.
1379000	1381000	It's got no maple syrup on it.
1381000	1384000	The reason I was bringing that up was because we're in that position
1384000	1387000	and then we sat down eventually in this terminal
1387000	1390000	and we're like, goddamn, this place keeps you on a razor's edge.
1390000	1393000	You don't know the language, so you're listening.
1393000	1397000	You know, when the people are speaking English over the intercom,
1397000	1399000	it's already muddled and you're like,
1399000	1401000	for me, I'm on edge all the time.
1401000	1403000	I'm like, I don't understand what the fuck you're saying,
1403000	1405000	eat the fucking mic, what are you saying?
1405000	1408000	Liam Neeson with a flying skull,
1408000	1410000	singing along with a server laser.
1410000	1412000	At this point in time, we'd like to...
1412000	1414000	When is all our emergency?
1414000	1416000	Everyone will laugh.
1416000	1420000	If you want to stand up right now, get over to the gate.
1420000	1422000	You're a Vietnam veteran.
1422000	1424000	Why don't you say no once in a minute?
1424000	1426000	And everyone's just like...
1426000	1428000	Understandably goes, look, man,
1428000	1432000	I understand hierarchy in one of two ways.
1432000	1436000	Either everything's taken care of because I have no autonomy
1436000	1442000	or nothing's taken care of because I have all autonomy.
1442000	1448000	Airlines tell you, you have no autonomy and nothing's taken care of.
1448000	1452000	They tell you, that'll be 300 bucks to go to Seattle.
1452000	1455000	If someone pays 3,000 bucks,
1455000	1458000	they have a right to tell you you're a piece of shit.
1458000	1460000	We're not going to police it though.
1460000	1462000	Like, now boarding...
1468000	1470000	Now imagine that in French.
1470000	1472000	And then I'm sitting down with Cody and I'm like,
1472000	1474000	God damn, it just gives me so much fucking anxiety.
1474000	1477000	And Cody goes, yeah, well...
1478000	1480000	The one sunny side of the street is,
1480000	1484000	at least we're away from those fucking sneezing people.
1486000	1490000	You know at airport terminals, the seats are back to back.
1490000	1493000	Like, the absolutely like...
1493000	1495000	It was just like...
1495000	1497000	Of course that family's traveling with you.
1497000	1500000	They're on their way to the fucking America.
1500000	1503000	All right. It was really funny.
1503000	1506000	Look, we got off on the wrong foot. It's 2019.
1507000	1509000	I'm glad to be back. I had a hard time traveling.
1509000	1511000	I don't like other white people, I guess.
1511000	1513000	I don't know what my point is.
1513000	1515000	But you hate airlines.
1515000	1517000	You hate airlines.
1517000	1521000	A lot of people have anxiety when they're doing air travel.
1521000	1525000	And so you're expressing your anxiety about...
1525000	1528000	What a lot of people have anxiety about.
1528000	1531000	When all of us travel, we all have a hard time.
1531000	1535000	You're subjected to, obviously, a dehumanizing event.
1535000	1539000	I guess I'm speaking from a place of privilege or whatever
1539000	1541000	where I'm like, you know, I don't get it.
1541000	1545000	Like, I only leave my house for one thing.
1545000	1548000	And then I always go,
1548000	1551000	Hey, send them a million dollars in advance.
1551000	1555000	Like, when I get there, could they just treat me like a fucking...
1555000	1558000	Like, something above a mosquito.
1558000	1561000	And the answer is always like, absolutely not. No.
1561000	1563000	Like, happy to take your money.
1563000	1565000	Very enthusiastic about that.
1565000	1568000	Oh, did you want the leg extendable package
1568000	1570000	where you can extend your human legs
1570000	1575000	to a point where you don't actually sustain permanent damage?
1575000	1578000	Sure. No, no, that's a million dollars.
1578000	1580000	We'll take that million dollars.
1580000	1582000	Thank you so much for flying American Airlines.
1582000	1583000	We love your million dollars.
1583000	1586000	Remember, we're the airline where you can extend your legs a little bit.
1586000	1588000	And then you get there and they're just like,
1588000	1590000	Hey, who are you?
1590000	1591000	What the fuck's going on?
1591000	1593000	What the fuck are you?
1593000	1596000	Slow down. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
1596000	1601000	Take your fucking shoes off and get the fuck back in line, you piece of shit.
1601000	1604000	And you're like, whoa, I fucking paid a lot of money.
1604000	1606000	And they're like, that's not us. It's Uncle Sam.
1606000	1608000	Get your fucking shoes off.
1608000	1610000	And I'm like, okay, I get it.
1610000	1612000	It's the government. That's cool.
1612000	1614000	That's fucking cool. That's all right.
1614000	1616000	Still a little bit of back and forth.
1616000	1618000	Each airline they pick and choose whether or not you get it.
1618000	1620000	Tell me, here's my shoes. I gotta go.
1620000	1622000	People get your name, get your number.
1622000	1625000	Gotta go. Don't care where you go, but you can't stay here.
1625000	1627000	What's that, a zipper on your jacket?
1627000	1629000	I'm a fucking idiot.
1631000	1633000	It's humiliating.
1633000	1638000	And it shouldn't be required necessarily to go visit Grandma for Christmas.
1638000	1640000	I don't see...
1640000	1644000	They've tricked us into thinking that they're doing us a favor.
1644000	1646000	But there's money changing hands.
1646000	1648000	So where's the favor?
1648000	1653000	But you have an irrational hatred of airlines.
1653000	1656000	I have an aggressive hatred of airlines.
1656000	1662000	Because if I'm gonna die, and I am, I would like...
1662000	1664000	Oh, I didn't mean like that.
1664000	1665000	Spencer seconds that much.
1665000	1668000	Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to like that.
1668000	1670000	Okay, let's walk through this for a second.
1671000	1675000	Hey, anybody...
1675000	1677000	You like this podcast, right?
1677000	1680000	Some people pay for the podcast. You paid to get in here, right?
1680000	1682000	So like...
1682000	1687000	Okay, I'm gonna put you in a metal tube.
1690000	1693000	And I'm gonna fling you into the air.
1693000	1696000	And if you even talk...
1696000	1699000	I've talked to aerodynamics engineers.
1699000	1701000	Because I'm always like, what the fuck is going on?
1701000	1703000	How are we in the air?
1703000	1708000	You ever talk to a person that went to school for this shit?
1708000	1711000	They go like, well, no, it's really not that big a deal.
1711000	1714000	You know, the big things on the wings?
1714000	1718000	They suck in the air, and then they push it out the other side.
1718000	1720000	That's how you stand there.
1720000	1722000	Where's the air coming from?
1722000	1724000	Well, you're in the air. It's like a paper airplane.
1724000	1726000	It's like a paper airplane.
1726000	1728000	It's like a paper airplane.
1730000	1733000	Pass, pass, pass, pass.
1734000	1735000	Well, then you can't...
1735000	1736000	Oh, good luck.
1736000	1739000	I guess your grandma's gonna die without talking to you about your...
1739000	1741000	Okay, I'll get in a fucking fight.
1741000	1743000	I'm gonna get in a fight to talk to my grandma.
1743000	1745000	Oh, of course I have a choice.
1745000	1748000	It's like every industry.
1748000	1750000	I'd like to go visit my grandma.
1750000	1753000	Which airline treated me well?
1755000	1759000	Again, everything you're doing is exactly what I'm thinking.
1759000	1761000	But stop, stop.
1763000	1766000	But it was like you can't go to an airport and go,
1766000	1769000	I, like every industry that did this to you,
1769000	1771000	they would be outlawed.
1771000	1774000	You can't go to an airport and go, my grandma died?
1776000	1779000	I need to get to Seattle by 9 o'clock.
1779000	1783000	Any other industry, five companies would be like,
1783000	1786000	hey, grandma died.
1786000	1788000	Get on the fucking grandma caravan.
1788000	1791000	We're gonna give you a face mask. We're gonna think.
1791000	1794000	And then the price fixing thing would be like
1794000	1796000	they would compete with each other.
1796000	1800000	I don't mean to be a libertarian, but fuck you.
1800000	1803000	Don't fucking give an industry
1803000	1806000	the ability to not compete with each other.
1806000	1809000	Dan, honestly, are you just like,
1809000	1812000	admit that you're just a nervous traveler
1812000	1815000	and you're freaking out about the fact that,
1815000	1818000	yes, travel is tedious
1818000	1821000	and there's lots of hoops to jump through,
1821000	1824000	but you're just a nervous traveler and you're...
1824000	1827000	How is that different from being a nervous eater?
1827000	1828000	Are you nervous either?
1828000	1830000	If you go to a restaurant and you go like,
1830000	1833000	I'm sorry, I don't want to eat
1833000	1835000	something that's gonna kill me,
1835000	1837000	or I don't want to eat
1837000	1839000	something that has a bunch of bones in it,
1839000	1841000	are you the asshole if the restaurant's like,
1841000	1843000	yeah, well, fuck you. You wanted to eat.
1843000	1844000	It's three o'clock. Fuck off.
1844000	1847000	Yeah, but that's not parallel to what you're talking about.
1847000	1848000	It's absolutely parallel.
1848000	1850000	If I want to go to my grandma's funeral
1850000	1852000	and it's in Texas and it's a certain time,
1852000	1854000	I have absolutely no choice over which airline I travel on.
1854000	1856000	I don't have any choice at all.
1856000	1858000	They have a monopoly. They're a cartel.
1858000	1860000	So it's not about your nerves about traveling and being...
1860000	1863000	Yeah, I don't want to die at the hands of fuckwads.
1864000	1867000	I want the skies to be filled with planes.
1870000	1872000	I want to go to the airport,
1872000	1875000	and I want people to be standing outside the airport
1875000	1877000	and be like, hey, man, hey, where you going?
1877000	1879000	Where you going? Let me hook you up.
1879000	1880000	I'm like, what's going on here?
1880000	1881000	He's like, where you going?
1881000	1883000	Your grandma died? I'll get you there.
1883000	1884000	Come on, let me tell you what you got.
1884000	1885000	I'll be like, well, hold on a second.
1885000	1886000	What's this guy saying?
1886000	1888000	He's like, yo, man, your grandma died.
1888000	1889000	I'll fucking hook you up.
1889000	1890000	Let me tell you what.
1890000	1892000	We're showing a Steve Carell movie.
1892000	1894000	We're going to fucking rub your feet.
1894000	1897000	Like, I want to fucking shop around.
1897000	1899000	It's an American right.
1899000	1901000	You spilled so much vodka during this.
1901000	1903000	It's good. It's good.
1903000	1906000	How am I the only one outraged by this?
1906000	1908000	It's true. No, I agree.
1908000	1910000	It doesn't make any sense.
1910000	1913000	It's literally like, I understand you.
1913000	1916000	Drink your vodka. Drink your vodka.
1916000	1918000	You're spilling so much. It's fine.
1918000	1920000	They're selling you the right...
1920000	1924000	The right to visit your children in Seattle,
1924000	1926000	but you'd have no choice.
1926000	1928000	And then you get on the plane.
1928000	1932000	I thought the peak, when I saw them suffocate a dog,
1932000	1936000	I was like, well, that ought to wake up a few Senate hearings.
1936000	1937000	No, no.
1937000	1940000	Are you fucking kidding me?
1940000	1944000	They beat a man half to death and dragged him off a plane.
1944000	1947000	These are terrible corporations.
1947000	1949000	They get together and compare.
1949000	1951000	You're just a nervous traveler.
1951000	1954000	That nervous traveler!
1954000	1956000	You're just a nervous traveler.
1956000	1958000	I'm a strange, terrified guest.
1958000	1959000	It could be both.
1959000	1961000	You hate it. You hate traveling.
1961000	1963000	You hate being at an airport. You hate being on a plane.
1963000	1965000	Why can't it be both?
1965000	1967000	Who loves them?
1967000	1971000	Why should they be able to take money from you
1971000	1974000	and then turn you loose against each other?
1974000	1978000	Like, when Nabisco says to half the population
1978000	1980000	or 30% of the population,
1980000	1982000	hey, welcome to a new white chocolate,
1982000	1984000	Nigerian experience.
1984000	1986000	Like, they don't say,
1986000	1989000	hey, do you like white chocolate?
1989000	1990000	It will take your money.
1990000	1992000	Give us a subscription to chocolate,
1992000	1995000	and if you want to make sure it's white,
1995000	1997000	fight the people that like regular chocolate.
1997000	2000000	Just fight them for it, because it's first come first search.
2000000	2003000	I'm almost certain this metaphor holds up.
2003000	2007000	Like, the airline industry is the only sheltered,
2007000	2011000	totally non-capitalistic, like fucking sheltered weird biodome
2011000	2013000	where a class of society is allowed to thrive.
2013000	2014000	You're just afraid of flying.
2014000	2016000	Just say that you don't like to be on a plane.
2016000	2017000	Why can't it be both?
2017000	2019000	By the way, how do these fucking things stay in the air?
2019000	2021000	That's the ultimate outrage!
2021000	2023000	You're selling a dream!
2023000	2025000	It's a giant piece of metal!
2025000	2027000	It shouldn't be in the air!
2027000	2028000	Why can't it be both things?
2028000	2031000	Yeah, it's a fucking travesty!
2032000	2034000	I take it back!
2034000	2035000	You love flying.
2035000	2037000	You love flying.
2037000	2039000	I love being on the plane.
2039000	2041000	I love Minecrafting.
2043000	2044000	It's true.
2044000	2045000	He's right.
2045000	2048000	You're just terrified of travel,
2048000	2049000	or being around other people.
2049000	2054000	You're terrified of not being crammed into a small space with other people.
2054000	2057000	But also, he's being oppressed by corporate entities
2057000	2060000	that are conspiring to fuck America and other countries.
2060000	2063000	I've never seen him do that dance before.
2063000	2064000	They are hurting people.
2064000	2066000	They're beating them up and killing animals.
2066000	2068000	They tased a man and punched his face
2068000	2071000	until his face was bleeding and dragged him off a plane.
2071000	2073000	And the corporation that did that
2073000	2076000	is doing just as much business as they are.
2076000	2077000	They're legally empowered to do that.
2077000	2079000	That doesn't fuck with you
2079000	2082000	when you're listening to their safety video.
2082000	2084000	That doesn't fuck with you a little bit?
2084000	2085000	No, it's bad.
2085000	2086000	When push comes to shove,
2086000	2089000	literally, you will have police
2089000	2091000	come on board the plane
2091000	2093000	and drag a man off the plane.
2093000	2095000	And then they're like,
2095000	2097000	don't forget to blow your lollipop
2097000	2100000	if we fucking have an oversight.
2100000	2102000	Come on, man.
2102000	2104000	We risked our lives.
2104000	2106000	We jam into a metal tube
2106000	2108000	and they shoot us like a lawn jar across the country.
2108000	2109000	We got to do it.
2109000	2111000	Our grandma will yell at us.
2111000	2113000	So we got to do it.
2113000	2117000	You don't get a choice when your grandma's sick
2117000	2119000	and you go online and you're like,
2119000	2123000	my grandma's sick, so I got to go from L.A. to Seattle.
2123000	2125000	You don't get to fucking choose.
2125000	2129000	You definitely do not get to choose how you travel.
2129000	2135000	They'll say, oh, this airline will go from L.A. to Seattle.
2135000	2137000	And they'll fucking lie to you.
2137000	2140000	They'll go, you can't even...
2140000	2142000	Imagine the shit that's a variable.
2142000	2144000	You go, I'm going to go from L.A. to Seattle
2144000	2146000	to see my grandma get buried.
2146000	2148000	And then you're like, I'm going to bring my laptop.
2148000	2150000	Do you see your grandma get married?
2150000	2152000	And then you get on the plane.
2152000	2154000	The premise is that you're going to see your grandma get married.
2154000	2156000	And then you get on the plane and you're like,
2156000	2158000	what the fuck do I plug in my laptop?
2158000	2161000	I thought I could plug in my fucking laptop.
2161000	2163000	Or it's broken?
2163000	2164000	Flight attendant.
2164000	2167000	And they're like, what?
2167000	2168000	What?
2168000	2171000	And you're like, I just can't plug in.
2171000	2173000	It doesn't work that way.
2173000	2175000	Fuck off, you piece of shit.
2175000	2179000	And you're like, okay, I guess I fucked up.
2179000	2181000	I guess I just fucked up.
2181000	2183000	I guess they just changed the model of plane.
2183000	2185000	Maybe you shouldn't fly anymore.
2185000	2186000	Maybe that's not your thing.
2186000	2188000	Yeah, no, those are my choices.
2188000	2191000	I should not fly anymore.
2191000	2196000	Or I should love the company that's been assigned to me.
2196000	2198000	That's great.
2198000	2202000	Like, hey, maybe you shouldn't drink water anymore.
2202000	2206000	Or, hey, fucking take it the way Nestle gives it to you.
2206000	2208000	Yeah, it makes sense.
2208000	2210000	If you want to travel across the country,
2210000	2213000	which could mean the difference between you getting fired or promoted,
2213000	2218000	maybe you should, if you're so passionate about whether or not you don't want to be treated like an animal,
2218000	2220000	maybe you shouldn't fly.
2220000	2221000	That makes sense.
2221000	2224000	Like, hey, maybe if you don't like technology,
2224000	2228000	just why don't you ride a horse around in a circle while everyone takes a train across the country?
2229000	2232000	Look, your side of the argument doesn't need any fucking support.
2232000	2234000	It's called entropy or evolution.
2234000	2239000	Call it whatever you want, but it's the side that doesn't need any help.
2239000	2243000	I'm over here with the other people getting sneezed on and going like,
2243000	2244000	We all get sneezed on.
2244000	2245000	We all get yelled at.
2245000	2247000	Yeah, it's all chaos.
2247000	2252000	I'm like, yeah, you know what would be nice is if airline companies were like,
2252000	2256000	oh, shit, we're going to go out of business unless we treat these people like human beings.
2256000	2260000	Fucking zag nut has to hold themselves to that standard.
2260000	2261000	Are you kidding me?
2261000	2262000	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
2262000	2263000	You don't recognize the...
2263000	2264000	Walk me through that zag nut.
2264000	2266000	You get a fucking refund.
2266000	2267000	Just anybody.
2267000	2271000	If you make socks, tuna, chairs, anything,
2271000	2276000	like there is literally one industry that where they're like,
2276000	2280000	oh, did you get a suffocated dog?
2280000	2282000	Shit, so sorry.
2282000	2285000	Anyways, hey, sold to them.
2285000	2287000	There's one industry that's allowed to do that.
2287000	2288000	The airline industry.
2288000	2289000	That's it.
2289000	2291000	And they have that like it always.
2291000	2294000	I always bristle in the speech or the video where they're like, you know,
2294000	2297000	you got to legally comply with all commands.
2297000	2300000	That means like if there's someone on the power trip was like, hey,
2300000	2302000	bark like a dog, you piece of shit.
2302000	2306000	Like technically speaking by the law, you would have to do that.
2306000	2311000	Otherwise they could then call security to beat you up and drag you tased out of a
2311000	2312000	plane.
2312000	2314000	I don't think that'll ever happen.
2314000	2317000	But when I watch that stuff, it's like, yeah, that's what they're saying is
2317000	2318000	yeah.
2318000	2322000	Technically speaking, we will tell you whatever you we want you to do and
2322000	2325000	we'll beat you up, which I mean is the law.
2325000	2326000	It's a it's scary.
2326000	2330000	I don't like the fact that there's a couple of lines that their safety video
2330000	2333000	is a wrap or like this robots.
2333000	2339000	And like if you see something coming out of the air, you have to put a life vest
2339000	2343000	under your chair and then you have to.
2343000	2345000	I mean, that's straight up Virgin.
2345000	2346000	Like we missed out.
2346000	2348000	They're out of business.
2348000	2352000	We all sing along to is like, but this isn't saving anybody's lives.
2352000	2353000	This is absolutely madness.
2353000	2354000	Here's the thing.
2354000	2356000	We talk about that a little bit.
2356000	2360000	Like, you know, like they make these videos like virgins was good.
2360000	2361000	I was like, I would watch.
2361000	2363000	I disagree with that for sure.
2363000	2364000	I'm annoyed with it or I'm not creatively.
2364000	2366000	But I'm like, they didn't make any mistakes.
2366000	2370000	The people in charge of whether I live or die sought to make a little
2370000	2371000	choreography thing.
2371000	2375000	And I'm not seeing any evidence that translates into Jesus Christ.
2375000	2377000	How are you going to get the landing gear down?
2377000	2381000	Compare that to what's the one where it's like the George Gershwin thing
2381000	2383000	where they're like, oh, no, no, no.
2383000	2385000	What's the one that's like the ripoff of Michelle Gondry?
2385000	2389000	What's the airline that were like the brunette flight attendant is like,
2389000	2390000	is that American?
2390000	2391000	I think it might be.
2391000	2395000	It's like a Michelle Gondry thing where she's like the like very charismatic
2395000	2396000	brunette.
2396000	2399000	It's like, hey, welcome to whatever this airline is.
2399000	2401000	And she's like, no, let me walk you through it.
2401000	2404000	And then she walks through and it's like the stepped out Gondry esque thing
2404000	2406000	where there's like stop motion involved.
2406000	2408000	But there's also like live action.
2408000	2411000	And it's like, but it's like you're watching it and you're like, oh,
2411000	2412000	they fucked up that take.
2412000	2413000	So then they just shortcut it.
2413000	2416000	And I'm like, what are they going to do if we fly into a mountain?
2416000	2417000	All right.
2417000	2420000	Like, I mean, you're inviting me to make that scrutiny.
2420000	2422000	Like, don't don't don't fucking.
2422000	2425000	All you got to do is like have a person like on the video screen go,
2425000	2426000	hi, my name's Gary.
2426000	2427000	I'll fly your plane.
2427000	2428000	I promise to do it safe.
2428000	2435000	Like, like if during that video, he's like, hi, my name's Gary.
2435000	2436000	I promise to fly your flame.
2436000	2437000	Not flame.
2437000	2439000	Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
2439000	2440000	Take it again.
2440000	2441000	And they keep it in.
2441000	2444000	I have a right to be like, what the fuck am I on?
2444000	2448000	I had to do the flight attendant like, well, he's not an actor.
2448000	2449000	He's a pilot.
2449000	2452000	Yeah, but your company doesn't give a fuck.
2452000	2453000	I had to do it.
2453000	2456000	We were flying from somewhere to somewhere, like over the Rockies.
2456000	2461000	And the guy, I think we're leaving out of either like Nevada or Arizona.
2461000	2466000	And the guy had cowboy boots on and he was our pilot.
2466000	2469000	And he got in there and he sounded like Yosemite Sam.
2469000	2472000	And he got in there and he goes, listen up, everyone.
2472000	2475000	We're going to go through some extreme turbulence.
2475000	2477000	So I want you to put your seat belts on.
2477000	2480000	I want you to strap them in real tight because you're going to be bouncing
2480000	2481000	all over the joint.
2481000	2482000	Yeah.
2482000	2486000	Because the telemetry from the three planes ahead of us said we're going to
2486000	2488000	go through some real tough stuff.
2488000	2489000	And this is not a joke.
2489000	2493000	He goes, put your seat belts on and strap them down low and tight.
2493000	2494000	And he wasn't joking.
2494000	2496000	We were fucking all over the joint.
2496000	2498000	I just didn't hear it.
2498000	2500000	And he kept laughing during this.
2500000	2504000	He was like, I wasn't lying to you, was I?
2504000	2505000	I love that.
2505000	2506000	I love that.
2506000	2510000	That's a good pilot because we had Yosemite Sam at the fucking control.
2510000	2512000	I don't like when they don't say anything.
2512000	2514000	It's like coming back from Tahiti.
2514000	2516000	It was like fucking everywhere.
2516000	2519000	And Cody was out like a light.
2519000	2522000	And I was like, oh, my God.
2522000	2524000	The pilot would come on and be like,
2524000	2528000	I could tell you about my crew, Mr. Bean and Jerry Lewis.
2528000	2531000	And I was like, I don't know what this guy's saying.
2531000	2535000	He might be like, I got to admit to you, I'm a little bit afraid right now.
2536000	2538000	His tone of voice was just polite and French.
2538000	2540000	And I was like, everyone was asleep.
2540000	2543000	And I'm like, am I the only one that knows we're going to die?
2543000	2547000	I was listening to a radio lab about War of the Worlds today.
2547000	2552000	And they touched on just this idea of the patriarchal kind of like,
2552000	2559000	the idea of the news industry, the male father figure going,
2559000	2562000	first of all, everything's fucked.
2562000	2564000	Second of all, it's OK.
2564000	2566000	I'm in charge and how that's being sold.
2566000	2570000	Have we created that with the news industry and things?
2570000	2573000	If you heard a woman's voice, you have to ask yourself.
2573000	2575000	If you heard a female pilot's voice,
2575000	2578000	it's a psychosexual thing to ask yourself,
2578000	2582000	what do we need from news anchors, pilots, and things?
2582000	2584000	How much are you being sold?
2584000	2587000	You have everything to fear, but I'm here with you.
2587000	2588000	I'm Wolf Blitzer.
2588000	2591000	You're about to see a flash in the background.
2591000	2597000	I would love a Yosemite Sam guy going like, oh, whoa, this one's a hopper.
2597000	2599000	I do need that.
2599000	2603000	Because I was like, why am I in charge of when something goes wrong?
2603000	2607000	Which is what the good horror movie or narrative does to you,
2607000	2610000	is it takes your guardian away.
2610000	2614000	Have I told the story before about the time I thought we were going to crash on a plane?
2614000	2616000	My friend Frank Maziel.
2616000	2618000	Maybe, but I think we should hear it.
2618000	2621000	I'm going to pour a drink while you tell it.
2621000	2625000	The theme of the story was that you're amazing and you don't fear death.
2625000	2627000	No.
2627000	2629000	I'll take you to the very end of it.
2629000	2631000	We were going to land in Chicago.
2631000	2633000	We couldn't, so we went to Indiana.
2633000	2635000	Have I told the story a thousand times before?
2635000	2637000	I think just once and really long ago.
2637000	2640000	Just to go to the very end,
2640000	2643000	it was the women that were the flight attendants that were on board
2643000	2645000	that made everybody feel safe.
2645000	2650000	And we felt secure and happy because these women that were like veteran,
2650000	2652000	like flight attendants, had been through it all.
2652000	2654000	We go, if they're not nervous, we're not nervous.
2654000	2660000	And when we landed, the woman came on the comm and said,
2660000	2663000	we're back in Indiana.
2663000	2665000	Oh my God.
2665000	2669000	And that's when, that's when we all shit our pants.
2669000	2673000	Because like, oh, she was nervous too?
2674000	2677000	We all thought we were going to die.
2677000	2679000	We thought she didn't think we were going to die.
2679000	2681000	Then we found out she thought we were going to die
2681000	2683000	and she is a fucking bad ass.
2683000	2686000	Like she's John Wayne from fucking The Longest Day.
2686000	2692000	We all thought we were going to die and she told us so at the very end.
2692000	2694000	Oh, God damn it.
2694000	2695000	Let it go.
2695000	2696000	Let it go.
2696000	2697000	Okay.
2697000	2702000	This is a nice segue into our next segment, which is Dan Recommends Podcast.
2702000	2704000	Yeah.
2704000	2709000	Do you know the etymology of the word posh?
2709000	2710000	No.
2710000	2713000	I thought it was a spice.
2713000	2716000	It's an acronym.
2716000	2718000	I listen to this new True Crime podcast.
2718000	2722000	It's two British ladies and one of them shared this.
2722000	2724000	Posh is an acronym.
2724000	2725000	Four.
2725000	2733000	In the olden days when getting too much sun was a definite gateway to being perceived as poor
2733000	2740000	and people started to travel by boat like as an upper class thing,
2740000	2744000	it was about the strategy of when to keep the sun on your face
2744000	2746000	and when to keep it off your face.
2746000	2751000	Posh stands for Portside Over Starboard Home.
2751000	2754000	It's the side of the boat that you sit on.
2754000	2757000	You don't want to get too much of a tan.
2757000	2760000	So crossing over from England to the continent.
2760000	2761000	To wherever you're going.
2761000	2764000	So left side going out, right side coming home.
2764000	2765000	Starboard Home.
2765000	2766000	To keep the sun off you?
2766000	2767000	I guess.
2767000	2768000	Right.
2768000	2769000	That would be the shady side of the boat, I guess.
2769000	2771000	Isn't that fucking amazing?
2771000	2773000	That's one of those things where people...
2773000	2777000	What does crazy spice stand for?
2777000	2782000	And that segues me into my Signal Boost podcast.
2782000	2786000	I've listened to so many true crime podcasts, but I can't...
2786000	2788000	I found this one red handed.
2788000	2791000	It's these two British ladies.
2791000	2796000	And in the height of my enthusiasm for them,
2796000	2799000	I'll give them the offer that I've given to David Cummings to come out.
2799000	2805000	I was like, Shruti and Hannah, if this gets back to you
2805000	2809000	and you want to fly first class to the States and be a guest on the show,
2809000	2811000	I'll...worth it.
2811000	2812000	You've given me so much.
2812000	2813000	I'd love to chat with you.
2813000	2816000	Also, any of our fans, if you want to come out first class,
2816000	2817000	Dan Harmon will pay for you to come out.
2817000	2819000	No, not anybody.
2819000	2823000	This is my thing as I extend this invitation to certain people.
2823000	2825000	It's such an amazing...
2825000	2827000	In this world of...
2827000	2829000	I don't know when true crime is going to hit its peak.
2829000	2831000	I think it's so funny.
2831000	2833000	Me and Cody listen to true crime podcasts.
2833000	2834000	It's all we do.
2834000	2835000	We gobble them up.
2835000	2837000	We run out of everyone.
2837000	2840000	And every single one is on a different podcast network.
2840000	2845000	And every single podcast network has advertisements for different ones
2845000	2846000	where they're like,
2846000	2848000	Hey, just a couple words from some of our friends.
2848000	2849000	I was like, I can't...
2849000	2852000	It seems like there's got to be more true crime podcasts
2852000	2855000	than there are people willing to listen
2855000	2858000	or that have ever been murdered by anything.
2858000	2861000	But I haven't hit my peak.
2861000	2863000	I just keep going, all right, let's listen to them.
2863000	2865000	These advertisements...
2865000	2868000	The one thing that's really funny to me is
2868000	2871000	I kind of want to grab people and shake them and go,
2871000	2875000	Please stop pretending this isn't ghoulish.
2875000	2879000	I guess the new wave is like,
2879000	2883000	Hey, we're going to talk about true crime.
2883000	2886000	You're going to hear about strangulation and rape and murder.
2886000	2891000	But it's because victims need not be forgotten.
2892000	2895000	Put this twist on it where it's like, we're doing a service.
2895000	2898000	I'm like, maybe you are, maybe you're not, but come on.
2898000	2900000	That's not what this... Come on.
2900000	2903000	I mean, I'll go to sleep on my couch and watch some date lines,
2903000	2906000	but I cannot do the Keith Morrison, the fucking guy.
2906000	2907000	I fucking want to...
2907000	2913000	I feel like perfectly good podcasts about people getting murdered
2913000	2916000	are ruined by people that are like,
2916000	2917000	Oh, well, we should make sure...
2917000	2920000	I'm going to keep doing my Keith Morrison bridge.
2920000	2921000	While you're talking.
2921000	2922000	That's wonderful.
2922000	2925000	But is it good to do a Keith Morrison impression
2925000	2927000	while Dan Harmon is talking?
2927000	2928000	Yeah, we don't know.
2928000	2930000	Maybe it's not.
2930000	2934000	But is it good to do it again?
2934000	2937000	The world may know.
2937000	2940000	I've been listening to this podcast called The Dream Podcast
2940000	2942000	and I recommend it highly.
2942000	2947000	It's about multi-level marketing and how it affects people and it's crazy.
2947000	2949000	It's apparently all a big scam.
2949000	2953000	The only reason it's still around today is because there's this big court case
2953000	2955000	that the people were about to go to jail,
2955000	2958000	but they have like deep ties to like the government and stuff.
2958000	2960000	So they kind of like got the court case thrown out.
2960000	2963000	And then in that court case, they're like, well, check it out.
2963000	2967000	Here's the rules for what is and isn't a multi-level marketing scam.
2967000	2968000	And we don't do that.
2968000	2971000	So we're in the clear and they're like, yep, you're in the clear.
2971000	2975000	And then it turned out they made up those rules to prove that they didn't.
2975000	2978000	And no one has rules on what is or isn't a multi-leveling scam.
2978000	2983000	So like that's now the new legal definition is what the MLM is like made to be,
2983000	2984000	to avoid.
2984000	2986000	And they're like, we aren't that.
2986000	2988000	And that's why we're not breaking the law.
2988000	2993000	But it's just fundamentally a fraud by the mechanics of the business itself.
2993000	2997000	And the only reason that it can't always be prosecuted is because there's not
2997000	3000000	always sufficient evidence to prosecute businesses and stuff,
3000000	3002000	but it's all fundamentally a fraud.
3002000	3005000	And it's crazy because it's like it's all this crazy capitalist stuff where
3005000	3008000	everyone's just like preying on people as a business.
3008000	3012000	And it gets into like a sexism because there's all these men who prey on women
3012000	3013000	and get them involved.
3013000	3017000	And so they're making money for the men, but it like it's secret.
3017000	3019000	And so it's like this weird thing that affects like women.
3019000	3020000	And I don't know.
3020000	3023000	It just, it takes money out of both sides of the family.
3023000	3027000	It's just this really insidious thing that seemed to completely grasp all of
3027000	3029000	American business and now American politics.
3029000	3031000	And it's, uh, it's, I don't know.
3031000	3035000	It's like, you find out like every problem we have is kind of all connected
3035000	3036000	to the same problems.
3036000	3037000	And it's like, holy shit.
3037000	3041000	To the idea that we weren't able to recognize what is essentially a,
3041000	3043000	not even capitalism.
3043000	3044000	It's like a pyramid scheme.
3044000	3045000	Yeah.
3045000	3048000	Well, that's the thing is that like the multi-level market marketing companies
3048000	3050000	that have gotten away with it for so long.
3050000	3059000	Basically we could make that work.
3059000	3062000	We just need to keep it rolling for a long.
3062000	3063000	Don't make it.
3063000	3064000	Yeah. No, I know.
3064000	3066000	I'm trying, I'm trying to be helpful.
3066000	3068000	Um, no, but I hit the theme.
3068000	3072000	No, no, I believe it.
3072000	3077000	I lost my train of thought anyway.
3077000	3081000	You, you, the burden of proof is on you to prove that you're not just jealous
3081000	3083000	of Spencer taking the conch.
3083000	3089000	No, no, I was trying to look for the, uh, the D and D theme in case we
3089000	3090000	want to play.
3090000	3091000	Yeah, that makes some sense.
3091000	3092000	Well, that actually now brings to mind.
3092000	3095000	Like you were going to do that and it was going to kind of, you were, that was
3095000	3096000	Spencer face.
3096000	3097000	You were going to commit Spencer face.
3097000	3101000	I was, I was scrolling through and I hit the, I hit the wrong side.
3101000	3103000	Uh, you, you backed me up on this airline thing.
3103000	3104000	Oh yeah.
3104000	3110000	No, the airlines.
3110000	3111000	I'm sorry.
3111000	3112000	As long as Spencer agrees with me.
3112000	3115000	I was just trying to do my job as a comfort.
3115000	3116000	That one's good.
3116000	3117000	Okay.
3117000	3118000	Look, here's the thing.
3118000	3119000	It's 2019.
3119000	3123000	Like, I'm not a big, uh, resolution guy, but like something that like I've
3123000	3128000	been really remiss about, um, we've been, as we've gone on, we love doing this
3128000	3129000	podcast.
3129000	3130000	It's amazing.
3130000	3131000	Uh, we've concretized it.
3131000	3135000	We've incorporated it, whatever we're trying to make it like a, a self
3135000	3138000	sufficient, like little bio dome of like podcastry.
3138000	3141000	Everybody that works on it, hopefully he's getting paid to work on it.
3141000	3145000	Uh, part of, part of that was like coming up with paperwork and signing
3145000	3146000	contracts.
3146000	3147000	It was an arduous process.
3147000	3149000	It takes the joy out of everything.
3149000	3152000	Of course you can't just like do something for fun and someone's going to
3152000	3154000	get, end up getting fucked over.
3154000	3157000	We, we, we've been trying for years now.
3157000	3159000	Like we, we're like, oh, it's our business.
3159000	3163000	It's Harman town incorporated and give this to that person and give that to
3163000	3164000	that person.
3164000	3165000	Along the way.
3165000	3169000	I think one of the funnier things is like one of our silent partners, Kevin
3169000	3174000	Day, who runs the ins and outs of like, you know, like, like me pumping the
3174000	3180000	show out, he's, he's like, I don't, I don't want to, I don't want to make him
3180000	3182000	a target, but he's pretty Bitcoin rich.
3182000	3185000	He's like kind of like, he doesn't really need the pie.
3185000	3189000	The bottom line was like at a certain point during the incorporation of the
3189000	3192000	podcast, he's sort of like, yeah, I have a problem.
3192000	3195000	I, uh, I need some of the money to go away.
3195000	3198000	Like, like, like, and we came up with this thing, Kevin, can you, can you come
3198000	3199000	up?
3199000	3201000	Can you come up and talk about our thing?
3201000	3212000	Kevin Day, everybody talk about how to give your money away.
3212000	3216000	So we had talked about like, because basically like if you were to do nothing
3216000	3221000	at all, given your situation, if you're taking money from the business venture
3221000	3225000	that we had to create in order to make the thing, you would get penalized.
3225000	3227000	That's, this is a common theme of capitalism.
3227000	3229000	You need a write off, you need a thing.
3229000	3233000	And you're like, look, here's, here's something that we can't do both ethically
3233000	3234000	and legally.
3234000	3239000	We can't say to our podcast audience, if you subscribe to the podcast, some of
3239000	3245000	your money will go to take care of, uh, Down syndrome, which many podcasts do,
3245000	3246000	but is illegal.
3246000	3249000	I think, well, whether it's illegal or not, I don't actually know about the
3249000	3253000	legality of it, but I do know that actually as a, as a pseudo capitalist,
3253000	3261000	I would actually say, honestly, you know, if you're asking someone for $5, uh,
3261000	3265000	shouldn't they have a choice as to whether or not one of their $5 goes to this
3265000	3271000	or that it, but, but what we came upon was like, you're, you're going to suffer
3271000	3275000	in silence unless we give some of your money away every month.
3275000	3276000	Correct.
3276000	3277000	And so we came up with this idea.
3277000	3281000	It's like, let's pick a charity every month and we can renew it at the end
3281000	3285000	of every month, but let's pick, let's pick something that your money goes to
3285000	3288000	cause you don't need it and you need to write it off.
3288000	3291000	Let's just get it out of your hands so you don't get penalized for it.
3291000	3292000	Right.
3292000	3295000	Like what I really wanted to do was like what other podcasts do was say that we
3295000	3298000	were going to donate 10% of whatever to some charity.
3298000	3302000	And as you brought up, that's a really bad idea because people might cancel,
3302000	3304000	you know, they don't want to subscribe.
3304000	3307000	I would like to think that there is such a thing as a Republican harm in town
3307000	3311000	fan who's like, look, I don't truck with this or that, but like, don't, don't,
3311000	3316000	don't put me in a position where I feel like literally my money helps, uh,
3316000	3318000	something that I don't believe in.
3318000	3322000	I, if they want to listen to me say they're stupid and pay $5, like that
3322000	3323000	should be there, right?
3323000	3324000	Yeah.
3324000	3325000	Right.
3325000	3326000	It feels like an ethical thing to me.
3326000	3329000	It's where ethics and capitalism intersect.
3329000	3333000	So, and so, and so I think the nice thing is that we go, look, this is a, if
3333000	3338000	you're, if you're a right wing person and you're like, I don't want my money
3338000	3339000	going to anything.
3339000	3343000	Look, trust me, your money's going to me and Jeff getting drunk and dying.
3343000	3346000	Uh, I promise.
3346000	3351000	Anything left over where it's, it's, it's supposed, it's going to a private
3351000	3357000	citizen who's our silent partner, Kevin day, Kevin now who has no political
3357000	3358000	affiliation.
3358000	3359000	He doesn't care.
3359000	3363000	He, what he said to me is he's willing to, we're going to find a charity eat
3363000	3365000	every once in a while.
3365000	3367000	We're going to funnel your money into that charity.
3367000	3368000	Right.
3368000	3370000	I'm donating the money, but I'm letting Dan pick where it goes.
3370000	3371000	Okay.
3371000	3373000	It's all going to the proud boys.
3373000	3380000	They just, they just, if they could read, they, they just, it's not fair.
3380000	3381000	What's happening to them.
3381000	3385000	We try to represent the, the joke.
3386000	3387000	Now we will do it.
3387000	3389000	Now we are going to, it's too late.
3389000	3392000	Now we're giving the money to the proud boys for real.
3392000	3393000	Where the price.
3393000	3397000	I honestly do think as a side argument that that's probably the quickest way to
3397000	3402000	diffuse some of these pockets of toxic dudes is that you actually just give
3402000	3403000	them a million dollars.
3403000	3406000	Cause wouldn't they just, it would be Sierra Madre.
3406000	3407000	They would just kill each other.
3407000	3409000	Go like, I want this big of a fleshlight.
3409000	3412000	No, it should be.
3412000	3414000	Like they'd be like, no, it's too dark.
3414000	3415000	I want it to be whiter.
3415000	3417000	And they'd be like, fuck you racist.
3417000	3421000	They just like, you could give, give bad people a million dollars.
3421000	3424000	They're toast, but we're not doing that.
3424000	3429000	I, here's my, my thing that I've always been passionate about, always been
3429000	3432000	passionate about in giant air quotes because I do nothing to do anything.
3432000	3434000	But like, maybe this mechanism could help us.
3434000	3437000	Or I said to you, prison reform.
3437000	3439000	This is the thing that I do.
3439000	3445000	Like I, because I feel like it's like easy to not do, like I, I feel awful
3445000	3450000	about the fact that we, when, when somebody fucks up in life, I don't care
3450000	3451000	how bad they are.
3451000	3452000	I don't care how evil they are.
3452000	3454000	It's not about whether you're a good person or bad person.
3454000	3459000	If you end up in our system, like where we have decided as a society, this is
3459000	3460000	how it works.
3460000	3462000	I don't like the fact that you get locked up.
3462000	3464000	I don't care how bad they are.
3464000	3466000	I don't care how evil they are.
3466000	3470000	I don't like the fact that you get locked up and then your nightmare
3470000	3475000	begins and that, and that you're like deprived of shit that like maybe could
3475000	3476000	help you.
3476000	3480000	Like, I don't, I like, like, I don't like that you can't get D and D books in
3480000	3481000	prison.
3481000	3484000	I don't like that you, I don't, I don't, I don't like that we joke about, oh,
3484000	3486000	well, where you're going, you're going to get raped every day.
3486000	3489000	And it's like, well, that one's not part of the judge's sentence.
3489000	3493000	But just in general, I think we have like a fucked up, twisted idea of like,
3493000	3498000	it's like, if we're a society that's going to lock up almost all the people
3498000	3502000	in the world, like, it, it, that's my thing.
3502000	3505000	I really, so I told you that like two hours ago.
3505000	3507000	I was like, look up prison reform.
3507000	3508000	Yes.
3508000	3512000	And so we may pick a charity tonight where we're like, sounds like this.
3512000	3513000	All right.
3513000	3515000	Here's where Kevin Day's money is going.
3515000	3518000	And on the Reddit, you may go, I looked them up.
3518000	3519000	They're terrible.
3519000	3520000	They're fake.
3520000	3521000	Okay.
3521000	3523000	Let's find that out in real time.
3523000	3527000	Let's, let's, let's popularize the idea of charity shopping.
3527000	3531000	So I came down to two options I wanted to give you.
3531000	3535000	The first is the probably more well known and much bigger, but not exactly what
3535000	3538000	you were asking for is called the Innocence Project.
3538000	3539000	Right.
3539000	3542000	And their job is mostly they go to people who basically everybody looks at and
3542000	3546000	goes, there's no way this person was guilty, but they're sat with a life prison,
3546000	3547000	prison sentence.
3547000	3552000	They go to, you know, get sentences overturned and they're very big.
3552000	3555000	And they all seem to be one of the most effective charities and they've,
3555000	3559000	they've regularly been recognized for dollars going to them does the most
3559000	3560000	good.
3560000	3561000	I don't want to go.
3561000	3562000	Okay.
3562000	3563000	Thank you for, yeah.
3563000	3568000	I'm, uh, I, I, I'm actually more invested in like, how do we treat like the bad
3568000	3569000	people?
3569000	3574000	I, I, I, I, I, I, I want the guilty people to not have to like, in addition to
3575000	3577000	doing their time and serving their set.
3577000	3582000	I would like it if they could like fucking learn a trade and like, and like not
3582000	3585000	live in fair, but, but yes, I love the Innocence Project.
3585000	3588000	Obviously and arguably a great thing, but right.
3588000	3591000	So the one closer to, I think what you're asking for is a similar project called
3591000	3595000	the Sentencing Project that seems to have two goals.
3595000	3600000	One is to give, make sure people get fair sentences because too often people are,
3600000	3601000	you know, thrown in some match,
3601000	3604000	some security prison for something that was not needed.
3604000	3608000	And second, one of their goals is while people are incarcerated, making sure
3608000	3613000	that prisons are not more likely to produce good results and people are, are
3613000	3617000	let out, you know, making sure things are not cruel, making sure education is
3617000	3621000	available, making sure that, you know, job training is made available and things
3621000	3622000	like that.
3622000	3626000	So they sort of seem to have a two-pronged approach of make sure people's
3626000	3628000	sentences are appropriate.
3628000	3632000	How do they do that in a world where it's like state to state, city to city,
3632000	3633000	like how do they?
3633000	3638000	From the literal five minutes I've read about them.
3638000	3641000	That's part of the joke is that I made you do this because I'm so charitable
3641000	3645000	that I'm like this lazy.
3645000	3648000	They meet with district attorneys a lot.
3648000	3651000	They have provided information to states and counties and things like that about,
3651000	3655000	you know, are you aware of the sentencing guidelines you guys have and what that
3655000	3660000	produces and how this person here because of the guidelines that exist in
3660000	3665000	this jurisdiction result in a 20-year maximum security.
3665000	3669000	You never see your friends the entire time you're in jail when other states are
3669000	3673000	doing things more fairly and here's how well this has worked and here, you know.
3673000	3677000	So they present information to the people who make sentencing decisions to allow
3677000	3680000	them some of the visibility they may not see themselves.
3680000	3684000	It's like an awareness thing almost where they're like hey judge hang them high
3684000	3689000	and hey prosecuting attorney hang them high.
3689000	3693000	Like you're getting votes and you're getting promotions by this idea that you're
3693000	3694000	tough on crime but.
3694000	3695000	But it's not working.
3695000	3699000	Can we make you aware of the fact that it's slowly making your city for instance
3699000	3702000	like have like recidivism rates that are super high.
3702000	3703000	Correct.
3703000	3706000	And they've also done work to where, you know,
3706000	3711000	they've taken prisoner complaints that have gone unheard of you know this
3711000	3716000	this policy this prison has is unfair and just mean-spirited for no good reason
3716000	3720000	and they've stepped in they filed lawsuits they've helped people.
3720000	3725000	How do we penetrate that barrier where like once you get locked up everybody
3725000	3730000	outside is like fuck that person and you're like can I get a toothbrush and
3730000	3734000	they're like fuck you and then someone's like I want to beat you up because
3734000	3737000	you're Dan Harmon and you've been locked up and you're like whoa this isn't
3737000	3741000	part of my sentence and they're like who cares like how can we make prisons less
3741000	3746000	of a nightmare so I can proceed to get locked up.
3746000	3747000	I wish I had the answer.
3747000	3748000	Yeah I know okay.
3748000	3753000	I in the meantime like yeah I guess out of the out of those two the sentencing
3753000	3758000	thing like like sure I guess if those guys have funding they're going to be
3758000	3761000	able to talk more to more bureaucrats.
3761000	3766000	Let's give them a month or let's say a month because a week is not long enough.
3766000	3767000	Sure.
3767000	3772000	So it's not if you're listening to the podcast your money isn't your money
3772000	3774000	isn't going anywhere.
3774000	3778000	Your money is going into Harmon town's pocket same as always.
3778000	3782000	I'm only letting you know as part of the show that one of the people that takes
3782000	3786000	the money from your pocket after everything's done is going to get fucked
3786000	3791000	down his taxes and so he's going to for this month give it to this random
3791000	3796000	charity which is called the Sentencing Project and we'll maybe at the end of
3796000	3799000	the maybe a month from now we'll go here's how much money we gave him and
3799000	3800000	maybe we'll look into it.
3800000	3804000	I actually honestly think I'm not putting it on them but I feel like the natural
3804000	3808000	mechanism of the reddit kind of mentality is someone's going to want to
3808000	3812000	take this shit down which I think could be a healthy mechanism it's like an
3812000	3816000	enzyme like they'll research the organization let's find out like
3816000	3821000	charities like let's find charities that we that really do great like for every
3821000	3825000	dollar that you give them what are they really doing to change your human life
3825000	3828000	and stuff let's find ones that we're fans of and this will be the first start
3828000	3832000	of the project like let's not be afraid to do it wrong.
3832000	3836000	Some of the some of that some of the guy that's why I don't even go down that
3836000	3839000	road is I'm like I don't know what to do like I got high with a guy the other day
3839000	3843000	explained to me that Red Cross is like the fucking kleptocracy.
3843000	3844000	It's crazy.
3844000	3847000	It kind of sterilizes or paralyzes you.
3847000	3849000	Charities in America are fraught.
3849000	3851000	You're like yeah I don't want to do anything.
3851000	3852000	Yeah.
3852000	3853000	You know and like it should be the opposite of that.

3888000	3890000	I don't know.

3891000	3892000	Like you helped me.
3893000	3894000	We said about that.
3894000	3896000	I feel good about the Bears the other day.
3896000	3897000	I'm not a big football fan.
3897000	3898000	Good.
3898000	3899000	Good for you.
3899000	3900000	Good for you.
3900000	3901000	Oh yeah.
3901000	3902000	Yeah.
3902000	3903000	We talked about the fact that the way that we really came.
3903000	3908000	Did we talk about this in the podcast where you were like hey do you own a
3908000	3913000	MacBook Pro and an iPad 2 and a thing and I like a list of nine things.
3913000	3914000	I was like yeah.
3914000	3916000	And you're like yeah.
3916000	3920000	Cameron Diaz had you in her phone and like you're part of like Fapgate or
3920000	3921000	whatever.
3921000	3924000	And I was like yeah.
3924000	3925000	Yeah.
3925000	3926000	Do you want me to explain that.
3926000	3927000	Sure.
3927000	3928000	Okay.
3928000	3933000	I think I just did but I was there and I didn't get that but.
3933000	3935000	Damn.
3935000	3938000	I got it but I know what happened already.
3938000	3944000	So many a few years ago there were some kind of high profile cases where
3944000	3948000	celebrities were getting their iCloud and other accounts hacked and what
3948000	3951000	these attackers were doing and there were multiple.
3951000	3954000	They would break into one person's you know they would guess your iCloud
3954000	3957000	password and once they've done that they can download a list of all of your
3957000	3963000	contacts all of your pictures all of your email a lot of really bad things
3963000	3965000	of Dan's you don't want to see.
3965000	3968000	Look my takeaway is Cameron Diaz has me in her phone.
3968000	3969000	Right.
3969000	3974000	So what happened you know they would break into one person's phone and then
3974000	3977000	from that they would get a whole list of new email addresses and everything
3977000	3980000	else and everything else and they would use that to break into others and
3980000	3985000	break into others and a friend of mine who owns a bunch of web servers
3985000	3988000	called me one day and said hey this one web server is acting really weird.
3988000	3991000	It's making all these connections to iCloud and we can't figure out why
3991000	3996000	and we went and looked at it and realized that it was being used to break
3996000	4001000	into other people's accounts and I had met Dan before and was looking
4001000	4005000	through the list of people that it had broken into and I was looking at all
4005000	4011000	of Dan's personal information and so reached out to Dan and went you really
4011000	4013000	need to change your iCloud password because I got it.
4013000	4015000	I got everything.
4015000	4016000	Yeah.
4016000	4017000	Yeah.
4017000	4019000	What did you see?
4019000	4022000	Everything.
4022000	4026000	No I made it a point not to specifically look but just enough to prove that
4026000	4031000	what did you see.
4032000	4035000	That picture of you was safe don't worry.
4035000	4040000	And I remember calling you when the Sony hack happened and I was like Kevin.
4040000	4041000	Yes.
4041000	4043000	What is happening with the Sony.
4043000	4049000	Yeah the North Korean Sony hack whatever like I was like I was in a fucking
4049000	4050000	full blown panic.
4050000	4055000	Here's why because if all of Sony's emails were hacked that that includes
4055000	4058000	every email that's received by Sony.
4058000	4062000	That means that like I didn't know that the press and that the public was
4062000	4069000	capable of being that like like like that level of piglody like where it was
4069000	4074000	like hey there's no yeah these hackers like dumped this file online.
4074000	4076000	Let's walk you through all of it.
4076000	4080000	The way like Amy Pascal was like like hung out to dry was like we're actually
4080000	4085000	like what you're proving here is that this this lady that like ran a studio
4085000	4089000	that she made one joke that was like wouldn't it be off color if I said this
4089000	4090000	to Obama.
4090000	4093000	It's like it's 9 11 right now by the way.
4093000	4094000	Great.
4094000	4099000	I was like I was like holy shit if one email that I ever sent to anybody at
4099000	4104000	Sony like ever gets in the hands of TMZ like I'm so fucked like it would be
4104000	4106000	such a weird out of context thing.
4106000	4110000	And I remember emailing you and like like going like just tell me like I
4110000	4113000	just want to go know if I need to go home and pull my brains out and you're
4113000	4119000	like there was one his his email inbox was deleted at the time.
4119000	4121000	But there is one I did do a search.
4121000	4123000	There's one reference to you.
4123000	4127000	It said that you're you're a wild card.
4127000	4129000	It was just like them talking about me.
4129000	4131000	It's like well it's bad ass.
4131000	4132000	Yeah.
4132000	4135000	Pretty much like a single a single email.
4135000	4139000	That's notable though because it's like it's not.
4139000	4145000	It was like I think ethical about that like like like look I like I'm just
4145000	4148000	saying like if you printed an email that I had sent to Sony while I was
4148000	4156000	producing community it would it would be grounds for like crucifying me.
4156000	4162000	I feel by our standards but it's it's like I know the word context is now
4162000	4165000	like a dinner bell that's rung by old fat white guys.
4165000	4167000	It's like you don't understand.
4167000	4172000	But it's like wait a minute like I the idea that I was a megalomaniac saying to
4172000	4176000	a corporation don't ever fucking tell me what to do or I'll fucking punch your
4176000	4180000	teeth down your throat like like at the time when I was typing that it felt like
4180000	4185000	a really heroic thing to be typing and six years later the idea that that would
4185000	4191000	be able to be pawed through by these clearly inscrupulous like oh I'm the
4191000	4197000	rap.org and I'm oh I'm banana peel net net like like it was like oh look at
4197000	4202000	what this guy said I was like terrified I guess I've been terrified ever since if
4202000	4206000	it helped you sounded more sad than anything there was only one email about
4206000	4218000	you yeah no I don't know I was really believe me digital and whatever
4218000	4231000	all right let's go to for Kevin David David David Dan can you do me a favor

5158000	5165000	like no music aficionado anything will you tell me Phil Collins is amazing a brilliant man
5165000	5173000	he played the drums on do they know it's Christmas time at all feed the world he's a great songwriter
5173000	5179000	yeah and agree it's like like he's a drummer of a band that started with like a fucking like prog rock
5179000	5185000	yeah and he Peter Gabriel urged and he dragged everyone along with him like like to wait
5185000	5191000	why hasn't that biopic happened I think now that the Queen bohemian rap city last night is the golden
5191000	5199000	yeah yeah yeah loves best picture yo Jeff and I have hung with Renny Maclet and Christian Slater a couple of times
5199000	5205000	it's true over at Amy Grant's house you know when she's in town with Clint Black you hung out with Amy Grant
5205000	5215000	oh yeah oh my god she made my record label Sparrow wait what Amy Grant caused my puberty and my atheism
5215000	5223000	because because she's like she's so Christian and with the kinky red hair and she's just like baby baby baby
5223000	5229000	she can't even say the word be she's so Christian she's like baby baby and I'm like oh your teeth and your lip
5229000	5237000	she has only been with one man I want to show you that soil unless she's the biggest whore out there
5237000	5247000	but I don't don't don't think so I was so I always had a I did Dan ask him and Amy Grant question no no no no no
5247000	5255000	no also how about this Dan I'm gonna give you a comptroller special you get to ask him any question about any band
5255000	5261000	because that's how fucking encyclopedic that's more important right because yeah okay so like so
5261000	5269000	really one of the things that needs to be said here too because I'm not gonna not give Dan an accolade that's really do
5269000	5277000	the guy who's headlining the first week of the first Friday shows of Coachella Dan
5277000	5283000	he basically discovered and brought to prominence basically like a Miles Davis to music right now
5283000	5289000	which is gonna in the history books of all the amazing things Dan has done and is fucking gonna do
5289000	5299000	this is still this would be a highlight for fucking anyone I mean Dan fucking yo it's because of Dan that we all have Donald Glover
5299000	5306000	and I think that needs to be you know when we talk about great music right I was like what are you doing
5306000	5312000	that's awesome man and you you gave him a platform to shine and and and shiny did and it's just a beautiful thing
5312000	5320000	you brought to humanity no no no no but thank you thank you amazing that you made that connection but like also at the same time
5320000	5329000	no no no no no no no no like like yeah because like so yeah Dan you can pick any band any any era and see if you can stomp
5329000	5344000	Jesse can't okay I'm still waiting for the Phil Collins man I just want to like like talk I want yeah I want to like throw shit at you because I feel like my music tastes are so provincial like they're only I know a lot of inside music business secrets I used to watch Clive Davis just
5344000	5357000	tell me everything about Tory Amos I know you know cuz that's one of my famous MTV moments is me with Tory Amos sing a dream on I don't know that no I don't know that oh that's Googleable
5359000	5388000	that's Googleable man take a look it's in a book reading rainbow a reading rainbow I can do anything it's in a book it's Googleable yeah that's that's on but there's a lot of stuff about me that's Googleable but that that we don't need to get into you met Tory Amos yes oh yes yes you sang
5388000	5417000	fact two years before MTV this is in like Wallingford Connecticut I snuck into a Tory Amos concert at like you know how you have maximum minimum security prisons but there used to be this this like place like 3,000 person place in Wallingford anyway you could like anyone could sneak into this thing that's Connecticut Connecticut is like minimum security concert venues you know but that's so you and why are we on that I don't know that was on me I mean sorry for that
5417000	5443000	you're with Tory Amos like oh yeah two years later I'm in her hotel room smoking smoking slipping on gin and juice laid back what does she like what does she smell like girl smells like cornflakes but in a good way like I ain't talking like those soggy ass cornflakes I'm talking crisp and this is I'm being presented with a video of you and Tory Amos on my iPhone it's Googleable
5448000	5476760	this is a we're playing a video of you this is you and Tori Amos and I know this is gonna sound crazy but in the video you're wearing a ridiculous hat so I thought I thought I'd bring it around and I thought I'd break out another crazy hat and this is pretty crazy this this hat got 5150 but wait Jesse so let me so like like so like I reference the idea like like like so is it is it
5476760	5506600	accurate to say your Forrest Gump adventure begins with this like MTV contest a pro like like like but I had a Jenny too you know but obviously you had gumption otherwise you wouldn't have won that content I did have gumption you beat my friend who was like I had to bubblegum to establish himself as the Dick Clark oh yeah I tell you all about that because the media always tries to pit us against each other like they like Duff Lundgren versus Sylvester Stallone again
5506760	5536600	my question is so obviously like Wesley Snipes versus the IRS but coming yeah but coming to that stage yeah obviously we're already a yeah even I shot that's crazy you should bring that up down we shot a coming to America type movie I'll be our senior Hall to Dave's Eddie Murphy and he played like a guy from Poland and then I was I guess his helper it was very like black sheep Chris Farley
5536600	5562120	David Spade we made a movie together it's never gonna come out because that was back when Dave was going through a satanic period well he was wick us so he didn't show up in half the dailies but number two he was also into a really heavy wicker candle period he was making can we can we talk about your trousers right yeah I'm sorry for going off the rails on a crazy train
5562120	5592080	crazy train leads back to the station and that station is located in yeah I want to know like the obviously I don't Jesse once I'm coming up he goes he goes hey Jeff you want to come to the whiskey a go-go tonight we're gonna go see LA guns and we any any of course we get backstage and we're hanging up with Phil Lewis who's the
5592080	5621640	fucking grooviest the man but like but to go to a rock store store its girlfriend back in it he fucking did he fucking did yeah but to go backstage at a rock show with Jesse is like to be on a magic carpet right of rock and roll like fucking fantasy well because so here's a question I want to ask you anything why are you a snob because you're clearly not a snob because you're not you're not doing a life humbles me a lot when you because you're like a lot of people who have encyclopedic knowledge of things
5621640	5647920	like yeah they make their bones by going like well I I talked to you about Phil Collins and a lot of people love that question but I want to know like like so you're the skeleton key you're like this ultimate fan you like that's your charisma so is there such a thing is a bad thing for you like I've made some bad moves believe me don't worry about you I'm talking about as a
5647920	5677760	consumer I'm saying okay it's like if I say Phil Collins to you I did a movie with Charles Grodin bad move yes you're you're like Phil Collins he did this he did that I say Tory Amos to you yeah I've only said the two things wonderful woman I'll tell you I'll tell you honest story but my question to you is could I say something to you that anything would make you go oh fuck that that's bullshit you know like Minuto or like I tell you welcome one thing I'm glad you bring that up one pet peeve of mine although I think the public definitely cried
5677760	5707680	out against it but it didn't need to be that mean to it but um it was very ill-conceived the Steve Carell movie welcome to Maveen about how he basically so he's let's just go there with this real quick he is a man that was at like a like a like a rough kind of bar and he was just telling all the rough locals that he that he got that he wanted to be a cross-dresser or something and so I don't know the alcohol got in them you know and they they like beat him well within an inch of
5707680	5737560	his life like this group of people in England so then this dude is brain damaged but goes to heal in this world where he gets a lot of like GI Joe and weird like action figures and builds an imaginary life about that with him in it and this movie is two and a half hours and it's called welcome to Maveen and it like had a 60 million dollar budget and I think it brought in maybe 1.2 million what you mean marwin yeah marwin I'm sorry I got that confused with aquaman wait you're saying you're saying okay there's should he
5737560	5766120	movies I don't recommend yeah well I can't believe blank pant what that was I'm sorry remember New Year's Eve 2000 whatever ministroke I'm out of it and we're sitting like in the fourth row at the joint and at the hard rock and oh this is a great story I'm glad we circled back and it's this is a beautiful time this is around the time that the white stripes were breaking this is when the strokes were happening this is when inner pool we're fucking jamming out they were just starting to
5766120	5790300	communicate their fingerprint analysis with each other yo yes in her poll was like coming up English you know I read I read an adjustee and the girl that you were with at the time Oh Alexis who's a crazy bitch well that notwithstanding there it is well we had extra tickets and you're like yeah man what's going on I go we got tickets like second row for the
5790300	5811220	process for she's okay she's not here to defend herself no Phil Collins isn't either but you had nothing but praise for him love Phil Collins treat your ex-girlfriends as well as Phil Collins you're right you're right she's got an invisible touch hey she takes you in
5811220	5840340	she seems to have an invisible touch but when she gets into your heart she's got a built-in ability to take everything you see
5840340	5860740	I'm falling I'm falling for her she seems to have an invisible touch hey yeah all right sorry it was it was specifically your indulgence that triggered us to speak it's a hard one time oh yeah what time
5860740	5877860	Jack we all go back to New Year's Eve those okay right now now thank thank you so the bad velvet revolver on stage it's the late great Scott Weill invest EP looking like anorexic fin he's got like one of them like police caps on his head like a
5877860	5891060	nazi like officer hat on okay yeah very Kenneth Cole okay sure my team me down like like like faster pussycat kind of yeah take me down ish yeah just six million
5891060	5906940	yeah so we're sitting there and we're watching and it's like and then it's slashing him into a form as well and then a weird like man like a mr. clean but with a mustache dude Dave Kushner nice which is now a marijuana strain
5907540	5936900	tell you shut up those yeah yeah so we're watching it and it sucks and Jesse and I just happen to be there and everything we're like oh we're like four like four seats away and I look I look over at Jesse and Jesse's looking at me and I go what do you think about this because it's like ten minutes till midnight on New Year's Eve and Jesse looks me he goes they fucking suck man I go that's what I want I want to hear what you think sir
5937060	5957260	hang on I said I said beautiful boy Steve Carell's other movie okay I'm gonna just say that it may be a beautiful story but like I don't really find it believable that there is a child born in Marin County California that's addicted to Crystal Street meth don't buy that when Adderall is so readily available
5957260	5987220	I just that's a big leap of faith in the plot that I really gotta you know but if we're gonna talk about prison reform how unfair the justice system is and how redlined and rigged it is against people of color you know and believe me too it's not you know black lives matter but it's like when it comes to the poor no lives matter and we as a nation gotta like come up on that and when we do prison reform is part of that you know but this is what I'm getting at
5987260	6017140	and I think I remember what I'm getting that I'm trying to install right now buffering buffering Jeff I can't believe that I'm having a senior moment at the age of 39 but it happened no I'm just kidding I'm just being false humbled but let me tell you that no I am having a senior moment it's tough to know I'm going in and out of it but I do remember we were talking about Amy Grant and how beautiful wholesome she was kind of like Tori
6017660	6042620	before all the kids with Dean McDermott can you put Jesse on the vote on the vocoder like oh yeah but did we get to the punchline of the velvet revolver concert that everyone is so invested in knowing the ending of Jeff I said they I kind of think they saw and I look down I go like what because all this talent is on stage you got all these great rock stars I go what is it that they're not doing and Jesse
6042620	6051940	brilliantly goes where's the songs he goes they got no songs and that was fucking brilliant and we stood up
6051940	6060960	oh shit we proceeded to party the rest of the night with Carrot Top our brother party in with
6060960	6072580	Carrot Top. Has Carrot Top been to Harmon Town yet? Why the fuck not we get Chris Angel. You know he's got fun props. I love the top. Yo the top. I love the top. I think the top could work a room that's like audio and like can't see
6072580	6102540	the top of the chart in your life and Carrot Top. Let's answer the question where are the songs. Let's do it. Hit it for the hardworking. Prop comic. No hit something less percussive. It's more about singing than rapping. Where are the songs is the question. Where are the songs? Velvet Revolver had a great song Slither but other than that there was really a lot of filler on that album you know so like it was kind of like a painful song.
6102580	6132140	Yo tell me your velvet. OK. Oh no but there's no more. Because we're with Dan and you know what honestly Dan. No. Brother it is an honor being in your presence. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. And it's like why the fuck am I talking like over. No no no. This is like being on fucking stern as being at Harmon Town. All right. No we're loving you're in. But the way Dan's non-linear interviewing it's like Tom Snyder like a little drunker and a little smarter too.
6132580	6162580	And with the good looks of Paul Rudd. My God Dan is handsome. OK. I can see Dan marrying Eva Longoria. He's that level of hot. Obviously you can come back every week. OK. Obviously. But I disagree with all of those points. No. I am not. Chris Hemsworth said is Dan Harmon our fourth brother. Where's the songs. And our Billy Baldwin taboo. I tell you I'm telling you like I was so Amy Grant was like
6162580	6192580	baby baby. And MTV was like hey she's Christian. She won't. She's like singing about her husband and I was like yeah she is. But like I'm going to I'm going to. I want a soil like I have the Han so the Han Solo complex like I like all of. Put that lightsaber in a Christian lady. The girls that I had crushes on in high school they're like they weren't. It was it was like there were the
6192580	6222580	Amy Grant's like they. Oh yeah. It was like what about Crystal Gayle. Crystal Gayle. Now now that was well that was coal miners daughter. Yeah. Yeah. Loretta Lynn sister with the hairdo to the floor. Pass the ass. But. Hell yeah. Pass the ass is also Dan's latest musical EP available on iTunes. Pass the ass with Paul Simon. Bruce Orange be in the range. And this is the lead single co-written with Michael McDonald. Where are the songs. I'm talking about.
6222580	6252580	I'm talking about singing with the lyrics. My name is MC singer. I like to hang out with my finger pointing at the lyrics style singing all the long day while I like to sing to the
6252580	6282580	top to the bottom. Fuck your mama so hard I belong inside of and Gamora. I think I'll come back tomorrow and fuck your mama again biblically. Yeah. Yo. My name is Yahweh. Yeah. MC Yahweh in the house. Make your wife turn into a spouse. If she looks back she's
6282580	6312580	assault. You could never call that assault because the woman is subject to the fight through the Bible. Why from Chapter one to Chapter four hundred thousand. I'm the man that comes down how and then on the Patriot. Yeah. I got the glass ceiling and I got the fucking dick key. Unlock misogyny with my big spiritual dick. Oh my God. Oh
6312580	6342580	shit. Hey. Yo. How are you doing over there. Well my name is Joe. I don't have a care. I'd like to put that to the test. Oh well that would be fine. I'm Joe. I'm the best. Well your wife has AIDS. Oh that's. Wow. That's. So does your maid. Oh no. And so do your kids. Oh shit. Oh fuck. Your house fell apart. Oh God. I'm Joe. But I hate
6342580	6372580	hate. I hate. I don't hate. I love it. I love it. I love. I love being amused by God. That's what I'm talking about. I love bringing down the house on top of people that pray to me. Oh get down on your knees. Yeah. Oh my name is Yahweh. Yeah. Oh okay. Hell yes. Joe. That was brilliant. That is
6372580	6402580	one of the archives right there. This is the man who discovered Childish Gambino. Dan fucking Harmon. I can't. You basically gave him talent. Jesse and Dan do you think you could freestyle together a little bit? Can't we do something together? Yeah. Fuck yeah. Like California Love. Zach you got a beat? Think about us doing something together. Like California Love. I'd be honored to be on the track. I want to do like somebody. You can do the rapping Dan and then you might just put in like the
6402580	6432580	Rihanna hook. Yeah. You put the hook on it. All right. This is the tale of Captain Jack Sparrow. That's been taken. There it is. You got something for us? All right. It's like John Travolta without the weave y'all. This is straight dirty. It's seductive and actually the dark looks a lot like Bruce Willis. Get ready for it. Here we go. When I look at you I see the sky in my nose and
6432580	6462580	my eyes. I see you and I look within. I see your family. My kin. I see love. Yeah. The man sees the love all the time. He's got a big big heart and he wants you to know that empathy and love are the best weapons that we have in this world tonight. Yeah.
6462580	6492580	He's got a beautiful heart. He's got a beautiful soul. But when it comes to gambling he's got no control. I'm an inventor. It's true. Yeah. But when he watches our Kelly or he watches a show that I'm talking about Nancy Grace. Yeah. That bitch that whole. Yeah. He gets pissed at her. That bitch is full of shit. I'm saying it.
6492580	6521400	Double down. Double down. Double down. Like I like Collin Sparrow. And I also like Collin Hey from Bend at Work. I like a lot of Collin like Collin Quinn. Great comedians. We got to get Collin Quinn. I like Collin Quinn. I like Collin Quinn. We got to get Collin Quinn so we gotta get Collin Quinn. Hooray.
6521400	6523400	Yo, fuck that bitch!
6523400	6525400	Yo, I'm a robot!
6525400	6529400	Yo, Amy's husband is a dude named Clint Black
6529400	6533400	And right now we just want to talk to you, Clint
6533400	6535400	We just want to give you a message
6535400	6537400	Listen, we just want to have Amy and you over
6537400	6540400	Me and Dan have a time sharing Boca Raton
6540400	6542400	We want to fly you and Amy in
6542400	6545400	It'll just be you and Amy and me and Dan
6545400	6548400	Three guys, one woman, we'll give you 25,000
6548400	6550400	We all share Amy
6551400	6554400	If I'm getting in trouble for having this out loud
6554400	6556400	I feel I might regret that offer
6556400	6558400	Okay
6559400	6561400	Yo, one thing that should be noted
6561400	6562400	Okay, oh my god
6562400	6564400	Before this gets my original scene
6564400	6566400	Let me just preface this
6568400	6570400	Mama, mama, mama, mama
6570400	6573400	The one big town Green Room is filled with peyote
6573400	6576400	The original Indian from the Village People, Greg
6576400	6579400	Is back there and he's smoking everyone out with peyote
6579400	6582400	So that was just me going way to the dark side
6582400	6585400	I think that's a teachable moment
6585400	6588400	And in fact, right now we were trying to make this song
6588400	6590400	Much like the end by the doors
6590400	6592400	You know, like, hello, father
6592400	6594400	Yes, son, I'm gonna kill you
6594400	6597400	But that was a song father and son could listen to each other
6597400	6599400	With my father and son, my god, please
6599400	6601400	That's really what we were going for
6601400	6604400	This was a play, this was a one act
6604400	6607400	Dan and I wrote this all over the New Year's Eve weekend
6608400	6611400	Again, you know, just a hero villain story
6611400	6612400	I played the villain
6612400	6615400	So my mea culpa, Amy
6615400	6617400	I think it goes without saying that we
6617400	6619400	Purely want a platonic relationship with you
6619400	6622400	Dan and I are both about monogamy
6622400	6625400	We are both about wearing special layers of underwear
6625400	6627400	If that helps with the intimacy
6627400	6629400	You know, we are gentlemen
6629400	6632400	We do not mean to say that we wanted to plow your field
6632400	6634400	That was a misquote
6634400	6637400	That was a Sony email that we sent to Seth Rogen
6637400	6639400	About his afro at the time
6639400	6640400	All right
6640400	6642400	I don't know what more to say, Amy
6642400	6644400	I'm really like, yo
6644400	6647400	Thank you for coming to Holy Talent tonight, everybody
6647400	6648400	Jesse Camm
6648400	6649400	All right
