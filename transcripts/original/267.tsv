0	12000	Ladies and gentlemen, around the world, wherever you may be, get ready for Harman Town.
12000	15000	Welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harman Town.
15000	17000	You know who he is.
17000	19000	You know how he gets down.
19000	21000	Dan Harman.
21000	25000	Beats, beats, rap, rapping beats.
25000	28000	Beaten to the rap, the rap that can't be beat.
28000	34000	Dan Harman on the microphone, slipping your mama's my Harman bone.
34000	38000	It's a tiny penis, but it gets the job done.
38000	40000	It's not the way you use it.
40000	44000	It's whether you have fun and whether she does, too, and if you have her consent
44000	47000	and whether you do it in a sleeping bag or tent.
47000	51000	I took your mama camping up at Algonquin Falls.
51000	54000	It's a place outside a shopping mall.
54000	57000	Zombies attacked and we took refuge in the building.
57000	61000	I fucked your mama so hard, I was gilding her pussy.
61000	63000	My penis is gold.
63000	66000	It plates your pussy, as I'm told.
66000	70000	It's a chemical process called electroplating.
70000	72000	I fucked it.
72000	74000	Fuck your mama when I'm masturbating.
74000	80000	Yo, yo, yo.
80000	85000	2006, motherfuckers.
85000	87000	Yeah.
87000	90000	I saw a pumpkin once.
90000	94000	I saw a paper hat on the dunce, a paper cone.
94000	97000	You wear it like a hat.
97000	99000	You punish kids like that.
99000	104000	You make them wear a cone made out of paper.
104000	106000	It's like Don Draper did.
106000	112000	1961, fucked your mama so hard.
112000	114000	I made her come.
114000	117000	She came all night.
117000	122000	She saw the light, the coming light, the orgasm light,
122000	124000	the Christian light.
124000	127000	I gave her what's right, put her on the cross,
127000	130000	sucked on her feet, poked her with a spear
130000	137000	just to make sure she was dead.
137000	139000	That's fucked up.
139000	141000	After three days, she woke up.
141000	142000	She came back out.
142000	144000	She said, give me more dick, because what's up?
144000	149000	I took her down to the park at dark, fucked her
149000	152000	until it was no longer dark.
152000	156000	The sun come up on me fucking your mom.
156000	159000	She took a pom-pom.
159000	161000	She did a splits in the air.
161000	166000	She said, rah-rah, hooray, chair.
166000	167000	And I said, table.
167000	169000	She said, furniture.
169000	172000	I said, cable.
172000	174000	We were free associating.
174000	178000	Fucked your mama so hard, I was electroplating her
178000	181000	with the aforementioned system.
181000	185000	I fucked your mama, but listen.
185000	187000	She liked it.
187000	195000	And afterwards, we went biking, cardiovascular.
195000	197000	It was spectacular.
198000	201000	Raise your heart rate.
201000	203000	Don't even masturbate.
203000	204000	No fap.
204000	205000	F-A-P.
205000	206000	No, not for me.
206000	211000	Fucking your mama is the only activity I want to be doing.
211000	214000	Coming inside, it's an organic process.
214000	218000	Makes your orgasm more wide, fulfilling the bandwidth
218000	220000	of your pleasure.
220000	222000	Fucked your mama at my leisure.
222000	224000	It's a job, though.
224000	226000	I get it done.
226000	228000	Like Larry Cable Guy.
228000	230000	I'm number one.
235000	238000	Harman Town is the show that's beginning.
238000	240000	Harman Town is not the show that's losing.
240000	242000	It's the show that's winning.
242000	245000	There's no audience allowed in the warehouse
245000	250000	because the man came down and shut it down.
250000	252000	Thousand Island dressing.
252000	254000	Yo.
254000	256000	Debra Messing.
256000	258000	Debra Messing.
258000	260000	Yo.
260000	262000	Debra Messing.
262000	265000	Debra Messing isn't messing around.
265000	268000	Harman Town is about to go down.
268000	271000	And then it comes up.
271000	274000	All right.
274000	276000	Shout out to Debra Messing.
276000	282000	Yeah, thank you, Debra Messing, for having that name.
282000	285000	All right, well, yeah, I thought if we started with a rap
285000	287000	that maybe the energy would be up more.
287000	288000	I forgot.
288000	290000	Yeah, I forgot about this.
290000	292000	I feel like people at home are definitely bopping their heads.
292000	294000	Yeah.
294000	299000	Well, yeah, so I was shaving.
299000	300000	I was trimming.
300000	303000	I was trying to trim my beard to go to this thing.
303000	311000	I had to do this Rose Marie documentary Q&A with Dick Van Dyke.
311000	313000	I was like, I'm going to be sitting next to Dick Van Dyke.
313000	316000	He's a very handsome guy.
316000	317000	Respect.
317000	318000	Yeah.
318000	319000	So I tried to trim a little bit.
319000	320000	And then I nicked.
320000	323000	And I disconnected right where the mustache meets the beard.
323000	326000	And I was like, oh, I better do that on the other side.
326000	332000	I look like a ventriloquist dummy or like an Amish Japanese assassin,
332000	338000	an Amish ninja fusion.
338000	339000	I don't know what I was saying.
339000	340000	It looked really distinct.
340000	341000	It looked really specific.
341000	343000	And it was going to distract me all night.
343000	346000	So then I just shaved the whole beard.
346000	348000	Rather than look like a shitty auctioneer.
348000	349000	Yeah.
349000	350000	So now I look great.
350000	351000	How do you feel, though?
351000	353000	Because you look younger.
353000	354000	Yeah.
354000	358000	But what's the point of being younger if you're a young tub of shit?
358000	366000	You look like a young fucking sad pimply seal.
366000	369000	But not a sad, pimply seal.
369000	374000	A day over five, which is 50 in seal years.
374000	376000	How was it?
376000	377000	It was interesting.
377000	378000	I really like that documentary.
378000	380000	I really recommend it a lot.
380000	385000	It has the unintended effect of making you kind of comfortable with mortality.
385000	389000	Rosemarie is 95 years old, 94.
389000	394000	She kind of like, she's almost literally born entertaining.
394000	397000	She's like four years old and she's like singing.
397000	399000	And then she's 94 at the end of the documentary.
399000	403000	And she's saying like, why am I left?
403000	405000	Does anybody have work for me?
405000	407000	I can come in my wheelchair.
407000	411000	And she's just like, anybody want me to do something?
411000	412000	I'll do something.
412000	415000	And I was like, yeah, there's that.
415000	418000	Or then there's the Jim Carrey method.
418000	422000	I watched that documentary where Jim Carrey talks about being Andy Kaufman.
423000	428000	And his whole thing is like, none of this matters.
428000	431000	He's like, oh, that's not a coffee cup.
431000	433000	I'm not about to drink out of it.
433000	436000	Now I did.
436000	438000	If you're Jim Carrey, you probably have to.
438000	440000	You can't just be like, I'll do anything.
440000	444000	So then you have to be like, okay, how do I feel about having a trillion dollars?
444000	445000	Yeah.
445000	446000	And being broke.
446000	448000	He started out so poor.
448000	450000	And Canadian.
451000	453000	Which is like, yeah.
453000	454000	Same.
454000	458000	That's like the poverty of nationalities.
458000	461000	So even a rich Canadian is like a fucking,
461000	464000	it's already starting at zero.
467000	471000	I'd apologize, but Canadians don't care.
471000	472000	Yeah, they're too nice.
472000	474000	Yeah, they're apologizing to me.
474000	477000	Yeah, they're just happy to be shouted out at this point.
478000	479000	They're tweeting.
479000	481000	I'm sorry.
481000	484000	You call this pieces of shit right now.
486000	487000	So you were inside a lot.
487000	490000	I take it when you weren't going out because that means you watched a lot of
490000	491000	documentaries.
491000	492000	Yeah.
492000	493000	I mean, it's what.
493000	494000	Yeah.
494000	496000	Do you do you go outside a lot?
496000	497000	I go outside a lot.
497000	498000	You do.
498000	499000	Yeah.
499000	500000	Yeah.
500000	501000	It's where the people are.
501000	502000	Yeah.
502000	503000	Yeah.
503000	504000	I like to watch the people.
504000	506000	How can you keep an eye on all of them?
506000	508000	You know that one of them is going to kill you, right?
508000	509000	Yeah.
509000	511000	Well, I keep an eye on that one, especially.
511000	515000	The only way to guarantee you don't die by person is to stay away from all of
515000	519000	them and that they are the number one killer of people right now.
519000	520000	I mean, I'm just trying.
520000	522000	I don't go to, you know, there's a lot of places that I've seen what, you know,
522000	523000	things go down.
523000	525000	So I know not to go to certain concerts in certain places.
525000	528000	How would you have known to avoid the,
528000	532000	I think you would have considered the Don McLean.
532000	534000	What was that guy's name?
534000	537000	I'm not headed to like an Eagles reunion.
537000	539000	I'm not going to any sort of like.
539000	541000	You can't tell what concerts going to get.
541000	542000	I can.
542000	543000	Going to get blowed up.
543000	544000	What do you mean?
544000	545000	You can't tell.
545000	546000	Are you magical?
546000	547000	Are you like a CW hero?
547000	551000	Do you have a, are you the mentalist?
551000	553000	The mentalist when it comes to concerts.
553000	555000	Or are you saying you have a system?
555000	556000	I have a system.
556000	558000	I live right beneath the Greek.
558000	561000	I've lived there for like 15 years as you do as well.
561000	564000	And you sort of get an idea of who's at the concert and what
564000	567000	the show is going to be by like, who's marching up the hill.
567000	568000	So, yeah.
568000	571000	Is there a concert you'd buy a ticket to?
571000	573000	And then as you were walking up to the Greek theater,
573000	575000	you'd like stop and turn around because you didn't,
575000	577000	you're like, there's a lot of Juggalos here.
577000	578000	Fish.
578000	579000	Juggalos.
579000	582000	Juggalos?
582000	583000	Juggaloos?
583000	584000	Juggalese?
584000	585000	You were right.
585000	590000	You were so right.
590000	593000	Juggal, Juggal, Juggal, Juggal, Juggal, Juggalie?
593000	594000	Juggalese?
594000	597000	Like Juggaloes or Goose?
597000	601000	Juggalese?
601000	607000	Give me a beat.
607000	610000	What's it all about?

655000	657000	You can sit over there.
657000	664000	It's probably better.
664000	667000	Hello, everybody.
667000	669000	We got shut down by the fire marshal.
669000	672000	But there's the live streamers, right?

764000	768000	Remember in that movie where he drives a motorcycle with Dennis Hopper.
768000	770000	I fucked your mama from the bottom and the topper.
770000	771000	I fucked her titties first.
771000	772000	Then her feet.
772000	774000	Then I did it backwards to the beat.
774000	775000	Said hip hop.
775000	776000	Then fucked your...
776000	777000	Fuck.
777000	778000	Fuck.
778000	779000	Fuck.
779000	780000	Fuck.
780000	781000	Fuck.
781000	782000	Fuck.
782000	783000	That's a backwards fuck.
783000	784000	Yo.
784000	786000	I fucked your mama's butt.
786000	789000	She didn't know what to expect.
789000	791000	It just hurt.
791000	792000	John Hurt.
792000	794000	John Hurt was a robot and aliens.
794000	797000	I fucked your mama so hard she was a praline.
797000	798000	I just prayed.
798000	799000	It's dumb.
799000	800000	You don't have to...
800000	801000	All right.
801000	802000	Cut it.
802000	805000	You don't have to rhyme everything.
805000	809000	That was intense.
809000	813000	There's a recurring theme.
813000	815000	I'm just picking up on a recurring theme.
815000	816000	Really?
816000	819000	About you fucking our moms.
819000	820000	Right.
820000	821000	Yeah.
821000	825000	It's been identified as a sort of crutch or a tick.
825000	828000	It's kind of hard to get around.
828000	830000	But it only touches on it briefly.
830000	833000	Then it goes away and then it comes back.
833000	835000	Then it drills down really hard on that.
835000	836000	Yeah.
836000	837000	Kind of goes away again.
837000	838000	Yeah.
838000	847000	But if I were working out at the gym, I could take that song.
847000	851000	I'd put that song on the playlist.
851000	852000	It motivates you.
852000	853000	Yeah.
853000	854000	Right.
854000	856000	You'd want to be lean for someone's mama.
856000	858000	Who made these beats?
858000	861000	Who made these beats?
861000	864000	A couple of them are from Paramount.
864000	865000	A couple of them are from Paramount?
865000	866000	Paramount.
866000	867000	Oh, Paramount.
867000	869000	Can we have the rights to these beats?
869000	870000	Can I have some of this?
870000	872000	Yeah, absolutely.
872000	873000	Yeah.
873000	874000	Fix yourself up a little cocktail.
874000	875000	Thank you.
875000	876000	And I'll tell you what.
876000	877000	I'll make you a special rap just for your workouts.
877000	878000	Oh, shit.
878000	879000	Give me a beat.
879000	880000	Yeah.
882000	883000	Yo.
883000	885000	Rob Hubel.
885000	887000	Workout rap.
887000	888000	Yo.
888000	889000	Warm up.
889000	890000	Yo.
890000	891000	Stretch.
891000	893000	Don't forget to stretch.
893000	894000	Yo.
894000	895000	Stretch your feet.
895000	896000	Stretch your thighs.
896000	899000	Stretch your abdomen.
899000	901000	I'm fucking your mama again.
901000	902000	What?
902000	903000	Tonight.
903000	904000	Stretch your quads.
904000	906000	Stretch your glutes.
906000	908000	Fuck your mama with my dick.
908000	909000	Flute.
909000	912000	A-toot-a-toot-a-lee-toot-a-lee-toot.
912000	915000	Mrs. Hubel is coming to school.
915000	916000	No.
916000	919000	Teaching her with my dick tonight.
919000	921000	Workout tape.
921000	922000	Workout rap.
922000	923000	Doing it right.
923000	924000	Fuck your head.
924000	925000	Fuck your eyes.
925000	927000	Fuck your ears.
927000	928000	Stretch them out.
928000	930000	Mrs. Hubel has no fears.
930000	931000	I don't like this.
931000	938000	I'm going to swage her fears through exposure therapy.
938000	944000	If she was scared of spiders, I'd slowly get her use to spiders.
944000	948000	But she's just scared of my dick.
948000	949000	Scared of my dick.
949000	952000	So I give it a lick.
952000	954000	I lick my own dick.
954000	957000	Show her it's easy.
957000	960000	A lick of dick.
960000	965000	Then I get between her knees.
965000	968000	Mrs. Hubel, please, can I fuck you till the break?
968000	972000	Break a dawn to the early light.
972000	976000	Mrs. Hubel, I might like to fuck you some more.
976000	978000	On all fours.
978000	982000	Doggy style they call it, but I don't like that language.
982000	985000	Because you're a woman to me.
985000	987000	A human first.
987000	988000	A partner second.
988000	992000	A woman third.
992000	994000	A dog fourth.
994000	996000	All right.
996000	1000000	Pick it up.
1000000	1004000	Don't forget to cool down.
1004000	1006000	Cool down now.
1006000	1009000	Did a good workout while I rapped.
1009000	1015000	Rob Hubel's workout rap is a masterpiece.
1015000	1018000	Fucked his mama in the east.
1018000	1020000	Went to Pittsburgh.
1020000	1022000	Eastern seaboard.
1022000	1026000	Fucked his mama so hard she blew out a knee cord.
1026000	1029000	They call it a ligature.
1029000	1031000	Did I fuck Rob Hubel's mom?
1031000	1032000	Sure.
1032000	1036000	But then I married her after.
1036000	1040000	And I gave her some dues from after.
1040000	1043000	And SAG and BMI.
1043000	1044000	Ass cap.
1044000	1050000	Don't go asking me why because the ass is there and it needs something on it.
1050000	1055000	What's Rob Hubel's mom's ass without a bonnet?
1055000	1057000	She comes at you backwards.
1057000	1062000	Looks like a cyclops baby.
1062000	1063000	All right.
1063000	1064000	Yeah.
1064000	1068000	Don't forget, walk it off and hydrate.
1068000	1072000	That was the most upsetting thing.
1072000	1076000	Thankfully my mom is not a subscriber.
1076000	1078000	And we'll not see that.
1078000	1081000	Was any of that true?
1081000	1084000	The exposure therapy part seemed realistic to me.
1084000	1085000	Yeah.
1085000	1087000	Live research.
1087000	1089000	She does wear a bonnet, I can confirm.
1089000	1090000	On her ass.
1090000	1092000	She does wear a bonnet on her ass.
1092000	1095000	Someone from ass cap to...
1095000	1096000	A bonnet on her ass.
1096000	1097000	Yeah.
1097000	1098000	That was good.
1098000	1102000	I got so excited about the bonnet, the rhyming with on it, that I fucked up.
1102000	1107000	When you realize you do have a rhyme, it'll just fuck up your shit.
1107000	1109000	I'm so winded.
1109000	1110000	That was on a treadmill.
1110000	1111000	Did you guys get that?
1111000	1112000	I was on a treadmill.
1112000	1113000	Yeah.
1113000	1114000	No, you were booping the...
1114000	1115000	Yeah.
1115000	1116000	It was pretty good scene work.
1116000	1118000	Really adjusted all the speeds there.
1118000	1119000	Yeah.
1119000	1120000	I really am out of shape.
1120000	1121000	I haven't worked out in a long time.
1121000	1127000	Do you guys have any phobias that are genuine phobias?
1127000	1132000	I would say the definition is not just being scared of something a lot or more than other
1132000	1142000	people, but phobia is a fear that would interfere with your ability to function in a certain
1142000	1143000	situation.
1143000	1147000	If you're unable to go out on a balcony.
1147000	1148400	Yeah.
1148400	1151760	I don't know that I have a phobia by definition.
1151760	1160720	I've had a couple of freakouts that when I didn't know I had this sort of...
1160720	1166280	One time we were shooting something and I had to wear a spacesuit for this sketch that
1166280	1167280	we were doing.
1167280	1170160	They got it for some reason.
1170160	1176320	They got a real spacesuit from NASA, like a legit spacesuit with a helmet and everything.
1176320	1182200	And I put the helmet on and it screws onto the neck thing.
1182200	1187080	And all of a sudden I couldn't get it off and nobody could get it off.
1187080	1191040	And I had a freaking freakout panic attack.
1191040	1192040	I was like, get it off.
1192040	1193040	Get it off.
1193040	1194040	Get it off.
1194040	1195040	Get it off.
1195040	1196040	Get it off.
1196040	1197040	And everyone was like, just calm down.
1197040	1198040	Calm down.
1198040	1199040	And the thing, the visor was closed.
1199040	1200040	And so it was fogging up.
1200040	1203280	And I just instantly thought, oh, I'm just going to run out of air.
1203280	1207560	And I would have been fine if I had just relaxed.
1207560	1209000	So I had a major freakout.
1209000	1210000	That's not a phobia though.
1210000	1211600	No, because that was impending death.
1211600	1218400	I guess I'm scared of spacesuits for space astronauts.
1218400	1223920	When I was a kid and we would play hide and go seek and stuff in the neighborhood flashlight
1223920	1233240	tag, my strategy was I would find the creepiest, darkest, tightest fucking place.
1233240	1237720	Where any human being would never even look because it would be like, why would a person
1237720	1240240	even fit in there or go in there?
1240240	1245760	And then I would just hang out in there until the game was over and come out victorious.
1245760	1250020	And then at some point, I wonder if puberty does it or if it's, did I bring it up?
1250020	1254240	Because another thing I used to do is just let bugs and shit crawl all over me.
1254240	1258040	But I think I know what happened there is I was so fascinated with bugs and spiders
1258040	1268640	and stuff that my aunt gave me for a Christmas gift, a big time life book of big full color
1268640	1275180	hardcover book full of the most poisonous spiders in the world and these crazy close
1275180	1280040	up photography and all these statistics about how fast they can crawl up your arm and go
1280040	1281480	in your ear and stuff.
1281480	1287800	I think the book freaked me out, made me start thinking of spiders as, I think maybe, I don't
1287800	1288800	know though.
1288800	1291800	So are you currently claustrophobic and terrified of spiders?
1291800	1292800	Yes.
1292800	1293800	Okay.
1293800	1294800	Yeah.
1294800	1295800	So I don't know.
1295800	1296800	Did it change?
1296800	1297800	Because we had a really funny prank we were going to do.
1297800	1298800	Called coffin full of spiders.
1298800	1299800	Coughing full of spiders.
1299800	1304680	I mean, everyone's, I wonder about, you know, when it comes to being afraid of being locked
1304680	1308360	in a coffin and buried alive, that's not a phobia.
1308360	1309360	That's just...
1309360	1310360	I think everybody, yeah.
1310360	1312720	Everyone has that fear and it's not an irrational fear.
1312720	1314720	You should be afraid of that.
1314720	1318760	It would be a weird disorder if you were into it.
1318760	1323800	I've done that and yeah, again, that's not really a phobia, I guess, but one time, I
1323800	1327640	sound like I shoot a lot of things, but we were doing some pilot that didn't get picked
1327640	1332520	up and I was supposed to be dead and, but they were shipping my body back home or something.
1332520	1338720	So I was in a coffin and just for this one scene, but it was filled with coffee beans.
1338720	1342280	So they covered me in coffee beans because they were like smuggling my body out of the
1342280	1343600	country or something like that.
1343600	1348480	What I had to lay in this coffin is they buried me in coffee beans over my face and
1348480	1351760	then they shut the coffin and I will say that was not cool.
1351760	1352760	Jesus.
1352760	1353760	Yeah, that was pretty freaky.
1353760	1356320	The good news is when that really happens, you will be dead.
1356320	1357320	Yes.
1357320	1358800	So you don't have to worry about it.
1358800	1359800	Yeah.
1359800	1361400	Unless you get buried alive on accident.
1361400	1362400	What do you mean?
1362400	1363400	You still did.
1363400	1365680	At that point, you're like 15 minutes away from dead.
1365680	1366680	Yeah.
1366680	1367680	Yeah, the most horrible death.
1367680	1370160	What are you afraid of, Brandon?
1370160	1371160	The dentist.
1371160	1372160	I cannot stand the dentist.
1372160	1373160	Really?
1373720	1375160	I have to get a car service.
1375160	1376160	It's a nightmare.
1376160	1377160	Really?
1377160	1378160	I cannot stand the dentist.
1378160	1379160	I didn't have it.
1379160	1381160	Because we have a funny prank plan for you.
1381160	1382160	What?
1382160	1383160	No.
1383160	1385160	Caught a coffin full of dentists.
1385160	1387160	God damn it.
1387160	1388160	Dressed as spiders.
1388160	1390160	Yeah, right.
1390160	1391160	With coffee beans.
1391160	1393160	So do you just not go to the dentist?
1393160	1395160	No, I go to the dentist all the time because I'm terrified.
1395160	1396160	What do you mean all the time?
1396160	1397160	I mean, I go to the dentist a lot.
1397160	1398160	Oh, yeah.
1398160	1399160	Too much.
1399160	1400160	Too much.
1400160	1402160	I'm currently dating my dentist.
1402160	1407160	I have a deep cleaning coming up at Hollywood Dental.
1407160	1409160	Steve Levy booked me a dentist.
1409160	1411160	Shout out, Hollywood Dental.
1411160	1412160	All your dental needs.
1412160	1418160	The keys to the bathroom are on little Oscar trophies.
1418160	1422160	Does he have headshots of famous people?
1422160	1424160	I think so.
1424160	1426160	You'd think I would have looked at him.
1426160	1432160	But the whole place, it's themed after fame.
1432160	1434160	It's a famed dentist.
1434160	1435160	I found a little tacky.
1435160	1436160	That's a great theme.
1436160	1438160	And I texted Levy.
1438160	1439160	I was like, really?
1439160	1442160	Hollywood themed dentist place?
1442160	1445160	And he's like, it's got a really good reputation.
1445160	1448160	And I was like, well, yeah, that's really fancy.
1448160	1450160	I mean, there's stars everywhere.
1450160	1452160	But I don't know.
1452160	1454160	Did you just read their press release?
1454160	1458160	I feel like the next sexual harassment thing, the next wave,
1458160	1462160	is going to be in the dental world just because that seems
1462160	1465160	like it would be so easy.
1465160	1467160	All of your patients are asleep.
1467160	1470160	And certainly there are tons of stories of waking up
1470160	1472160	and there's a dick on your shoulder.
1472160	1473160	They're pointing at me.
1473160	1474160	I didn't do that.
1474160	1475160	Yeah, there are.
1475160	1476160	There are tons of those stories.
1476160	1478160	I put my dick on the dentist's shoulder.
1478160	1480160	Well, we had a wave of those.
1480160	1483160	Yeah, I mean, speaking of things that I'm surprised
1483160	1485160	haven't come up given the current climate,
1485160	1488160	man, Sean Penn must be just in a fucking cellar somewhere
1488160	1490160	with a crossbow pointed at the door.
1490160	1494160	Yeah, it seems like there would be a lot of people that are like,
1494160	1496160	oh, you.
1496160	1501160	It's almost like some people whose savagery was outed 20 years ago
1501160	1504160	or getting some kind of grandfathered in or something.
1504160	1505160	Yeah.
1505160	1506160	Oh, yeah.
1506160	1508160	Yeah, I tied Madonna to a chair and beat her for three days.
1508160	1511160	But you know, I got caught doing that.
1511160	1514160	I paid my debt to society by making some movies.
1514160	1515160	Yeah.
1515160	1518160	Let's all still play Chris Brown and R. Kelly.
1518160	1519160	Yeah.
1519160	1521160	It's the craziest thing.
1521160	1522160	It's the craziest thing.
1522160	1527160	It seems like it's going to spread to pro sports and music people.
1527160	1528160	Those are easy, though.
1528160	1529160	Yeah, it's so easy.
1529160	1532160	I want every industry to have to start giving people up.
1532160	1533160	Yeah, like Wall Street and yeah.
1533160	1536160	Yeah, I want doctors and dentists and mailmen.
1536160	1537160	I want the whole thing.
1537160	1538160	Yeah, the mailmen.
1538160	1540160	Yeah, you know mailmen get down.
1540160	1544160	My mailman comes to my door with his dick out.
1544160	1551160	Are you guys scared that it's going to extend to like just like
1551160	1552160	secrets, though?
1552160	1556160	Like private victimless stuff that just makes you a sicko?
1556160	1560160	Like if we start opening laptops and looking at bookmarks and stuff
1560160	1565160	like do you ever worry that it's just going to get to that?
1565160	1568160	Or it's like what do you think about when you masturbate?
1568160	1569160	Or what joke?
1569160	1572160	It seems like it seems like there would be a line somewhere where
1572160	1577160	and also just it seems like eventually there will be so much of it
1577160	1579160	that none of it resonates.
1579160	1580160	Do you know what I mean?
1580160	1581160	Right.
1581160	1583160	Yeah, I keep worrying about that, too, like there being too much
1583160	1584160	of a backlash.
1584160	1585160	Yeah.
1585160	1591160	Or once it comes out, once somebody proves that any of that,
1591160	1594160	and I didn't mean to derail us into this conversation.
1594160	1595160	I don't think you did.
1595160	1598160	I think I probably have a reason why we brought it up.
1598160	1605160	But eventually someone will get caught making it up.
1605160	1607160	Someone would be like, oh, I made it up.
1607160	1609160	I was trying to get money or whatever.
1609160	1613160	And then that will, that scares me because that could discredit
1613160	1616160	the whole situation or delete the whole.
1616160	1619160	I also don't worry about either between that or just the sheer
1619160	1624160	volume of it and the breadth of it that like it'll play into,
1624160	1627160	you know, men's hands and they can go like see what happens.
1627160	1633160	After like a year and a half of it, that men will go, see ladies.
1633160	1636160	You just, you can't run the party.
1636160	1639160	This has gotten crazy, you know.
1639160	1642160	And then it's going to, and then we just go into Handmaid's Tale
1642160	1645160	because it like gets so, like if something happens where like a
1645160	1646160	dude gets burnt alive.
1646160	1648160	I haven't seen Handmaid's Tale, no spoilers.
1648160	1650160	Yeah.
1650160	1653160	But like if there was, yeah, I guess I'm saying the same thing
1653160	1655160	you are going to be like if there was like some crazy thing
1655160	1658160	or like a guy got stoned to death or something at an Albertsons.
1658160	1662160	And then it was the wrong Jeremy Piven.
1662160	1664160	It was like Jeremiah Piven.
1664160	1665160	Yeah.
1665160	1670160	And he was like a feminist activist who was on his way to paint a sign.
1670160	1673160	Right now there's a Brian Posen and a Brian Posen.
1673160	1677160	Brian Posen has just been outed in Chicago.
1677160	1680160	It's a big deal in the comedy community.
1680160	1682160	And there's an LA group of people who know about him,
1682160	1685160	but Brian Posen is getting teased.
1685160	1687160	It's a little bit of the drama.
1687160	1692160	I feel bad for real Joe Walsh because there's that Joe Walsh guy on Twitter
1692160	1695160	and he's like always like, hey, you ever notice Santa Claus isn't black
1695160	1696160	or whatever.
1696160	1697160	Yeah, that confused me for a little bit.
1697160	1698160	But it's always just Joe Walsh.
1698160	1700160	Yeah, I was like, what the fuck?
1700160	1701160	And then people will make jokes.
1701160	1704160	They'll go like, hey, you're living a life of illusion if you don't think
1704160	1708160	that, you know, the health care should be socialized.
1708160	1710160	I'm like, this is so confusing and sad.
1711160	1715160	I thought for a hot second that Joe Walsh had become like a PJ O'Rourke figure
1715160	1717160	or something that he was like.
1717160	1718160	I did too, yeah.
1718160	1720160	He was like, life's been good to me so far.
1720160	1722160	Life's been really good to me so far.
1722160	1723160	You know what?
1723160	1725160	And it's because I worked hard.
1725160	1727160	Yeah, I pulled a Dennis Miller.
1727160	1729160	I pulled myself up by my bootstraps.
1731160	1734160	No, but Jeff Davis knows the real Joe Walsh,
1734160	1737160	who's still out there bopping around and being groovy
1737160	1739160	and playing with the Eagles.
1740160	1741160	Glenn Fry died, right?
1741160	1742160	Yeah, yeah.
1742160	1747160	So I guess I think maybe Glenn Fry's death brought the other Eagles closer
1747160	1749160	and now they're like, I think touring and stuff.
1749160	1750160	Oh, really?
1750160	1752160	Something for you kids to get excited about.
1752160	1754160	The audience is going crazy.
1756160	1757160	They're going nuts.
1757160	1759160	Cold War kids will be opening for them.
1761160	1763160	If that means anything to you kids.
1764160	1771160	I wonder if you are in a band that has seen better days, let's say.
1771160	1775160	You guys were big at one point or legendary at one point,
1775160	1778160	but you still have to live and make a living
1778160	1780160	and that's what you've been doing your whole life.
1780160	1783160	I wonder if it eventually starts to suck
1783160	1786160	when you're just doing county fairs
1786160	1789160	and you're like, she's my cherry pie.
1789160	1790160	Yeah, all right.
1790160	1791160	Fuck.
1792160	1793160	Yeah, I'm sure.
1793160	1795160	No offense to Warren or if that's who that was.
1795160	1796160	Total offense.
1796160	1797160	Yeah.
1797160	1799160	I'm sure there's bands against each individual,
1799160	1801160	each individual band in a case by case,
1801160	1803160	like some of them are excited about it
1803160	1807160	and some of them are like, hate it, but it's like, yeah.
1807160	1810160	It's usually when somebody gets sick in the band
1810160	1812160	and they're like, we got to get together
1812160	1815160	because Garth's going to need a kidney
1815160	1818160	and he didn't invest so good after rehab.
1818160	1820160	And that's always kind of sweet to see.
1820160	1822160	It's also kind of dark because the lead singer
1822160	1824160	is still prosperous and goes off on his own
1824160	1828160	and kind of looks back at his band like, I mean, I'm Pharrell.
1828160	1829160	Yeah.
1829160	1830160	Fuck Garth.
1830160	1831160	Right.
1831160	1832160	Fuck Garth.
1832160	1834160	I'm Pharrell and you guys are nerd.
1834160	1836160	It's great.
1836160	1840160	I guess Prince will get the revolution back together again
1840160	1842160	because Lisa and Wendy need something.
1842160	1845160	Lisa and Wendy need socks.
1845160	1847160	They spent all their sock money.
1847160	1848160	Yeah.
1849160	1852160	I like that Pharrell and Garth are out there together.
1855160	1858160	You know New Edition was like, we got to, Bobby Brown,
1858160	1859160	we got to do something.
1859160	1860160	We got to do it.
1860160	1861160	We got to help them out.
1861160	1862160	Yeah.
1862160	1873160	I hope that I find a billion dollars under a rock tomorrow
1873160	1879160	so I can curl up under my bed and wait for the world to end.
1879160	1880160	That might happen.
1880160	1881160	Give me a beat.
1886160	1888160	I'm not working out to this.
1888160	1890160	Zippity's out.
1890160	1892160	Zippity's through.
1894160	1895160	Yeah.
1895160	1896160	Tomas.
1896160	1897160	Tomas.
1897160	1898160	Tomas.
1898160	1899160	Yeah.
1899160	1900160	French rapping.
1900160	1902160	Tomas in the house.
1902160	1903160	MC Tomas.
1903160	1904160	Tomas.
1904160	1905160	Tomas.
1905160	1906160	Tomas.
1906160	1907160	Tole house cookies in effect.
1907160	1909160	Put them on a sheet in the oven.
1909160	1913160	Don't forget to take them out so they don't burn down your place.
1913160	1915160	Tole house cookies all over the place.
1915160	1918160	Bet you bite a chip motherfucker.
1918160	1920160	Bet you bite a chip Chris Tucker.
1920160	1925160	Bet you bite a chip Brother Trucker.
1925160	1926160	10-4.
1926160	1929160	Tole house cookies on the plate to begin with.
1929160	1932160	Tole house cookies going in your mouth like a Sith.
1932160	1934160	Sith Lord using the force.
1934160	1938160	Fuck your mama so hard she said of course.
1938160	1941160	Fuck me more.
1941160	1943160	Fuck me in Morse code.
1943160	1947160	Fuck me like beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep.
1947160	1950160	That was me spelling F-U-C-K.
1950160	1954160	Morse code semen on her face and it's okay.
1954160	1956160	She said do it again.
1956160	1959160	Tell out your orgasm.
1959160	1966160	Tole house cookies MC tole house.
1966160	1967160	Yo.
1967160	1969160	Chips ahoy.
1969160	1972160	It's a boy.
1972160	1975160	Get the toys.
1975160	1978160	I'm not jealous of devices.
1978160	1981160	I think it makes making love nicest.
1981160	1983160	When a woman's got a vibrator.
1983160	1986160	Tole house cookies come back later.
1986160	1993160	Go in the basement and eat while she does it to herself with a dildo.
1993160	1996160	All right.
1996160	2001160	Tole house cookies.
2001160	2004160	Ever opened a can?
2004160	2007160	Just eat it with a spoon because you're depressed.
2007160	2011160	Yo.
2011160	2013160	Show them how we doing.
2013160	2014160	Yeah.
2014160	2016160	Tell them how you do it.
2016160	2017160	That's what he's saying.
2017160	2018160	Okay.
2018160	2019160	Yo.
2019160	2020160	Okay.
2020160	2021160	All right.
2021160	2022160	Here we go.
2022160	2023160	Here's the thing.
2023160	2024160	All right.
2024160	2025160	That was warming up.
2025160	2026160	Take a stick.
2026160	2027160	Take a log.
2027160	2028160	Take your mama.
2028160	2029160	To a bog.
2029160	2030160	The fumes come up.
2030160	2032160	You inhale them.
2032160	2034160	Show them how we doing.
2034160	2035160	How we doing.
2035160	2036160	How we doing.
2036160	2037160	Yeah.
2037160	2040160	I just like to tease him at the end with an adventure to a bog.
2040160	2043160	Sound like there was going to be a pretty cool adventure in that bog.
2043160	2044160	Yeah.
2044160	2045160	Yeah.
2045160	2046160	People are going there with the stick.
2046160	2047160	Yeah.
2047160	2048160	I have to wait.
2048160	2049160	I was super into the tole house thing.
2049160	2050160	Yeah.
2050160	2053160	And then he was saying show them how we do it.
2053160	2054160	Yeah.
2054160	2055160	Yeah.
2055160	2056160	I thought he was saying Tomas.
2056160	2058160	I wasn't sure.
2058160	2059160	I probably don't need to tell you.
2059160	2060160	I couldn't tell what he was saying.
2060160	2061160	Yeah.
2061160	2062160	And he was throwing me.
2062160	2064160	My street when I was growing up was tole house road.
2064160	2065160	No shit.
2065160	2066160	Yeah.
2066160	2069160	So I was pretty psyched about that when I was little.
2069160	2071160	Did people make jokes?
2071160	2072160	A lot of people.
2072160	2074160	I was harassed a lot.
2074160	2077160	People were like oh you fucking elf.
2077160	2078160	You know.
2078160	2080160	It was terrible.
2080160	2082160	I'm like now I can laugh about it.
2082160	2084160	And if you corrected them and said that's Keebler.
2084160	2085160	That's right.
2085160	2089160	They'd be like oh now you're a cookie expert so you are an elf.
2089160	2090160	That's right.
2090160	2092160	There's no point in even trying to correct them.
2092160	2093160	Yeah.
2093160	2096160	Everybody thought I was the tole house cookie elf.
2096160	2103160	I lived on 52nd and Calumet.
2103160	2105160	Is that a Manhattan.
2105160	2106160	Nope.
2106160	2108160	Just sounds like it's in Milwaukee.
2108160	2109160	Oh.
2109160	2113160	My dog got hit on that road on Calumet.
2113160	2115160	Calumet was a busy street.
2115160	2120160	And if I ever want to make myself cry like when I'm acting I can just
2120160	2127160	think about the sound that my dog Susu made when she got hit.
2127160	2133160	It was like a hit and run and it was like crazy sound sound of the car.
2133160	2134160	I remember.
2134160	2141160	And then and then this like plaintiff whale that Susu made before just
2141160	2142160	dropping dead.
2142160	2146160	It's like she got hit and then went and then just made the sound and then
2146160	2147160	died.
2147160	2151160	And then I and then my dad had to go out and like scoop her up.
2151160	2156160	And I was like a little kid and was like at eye level with the dog as it
2156160	2160160	was swinging in his hand and he had this like annoyed look on his face.
2160160	2163160	He was like really mad that the dog got hit.
2163160	2164160	Oh.
2164160	2166160	You've got to say give me a beat.
2166160	2173160	A very long rap about your childhood pet getting killed.
2174160	2175160	Yeah.
2175160	2179160	Our I'm not going to dwell on this topic for long but I remember our
2179160	2183160	neighbors hit our cat and killed our cat one of our cats when we were
2183160	2187160	little kids and you know they felt terrible and they came to the door and
2187160	2191160	the first thing out of their mouth was can we buy you a new cat.
2191160	2196160	Oh and we were like why what like you know they were trying to like
2196160	2201160	start at three new cats bidding starts at three.
2202160	2208160	They packed our house with so many cats and all was forgiven.
2208160	2212160	No it was just that was such a weird inclination on their part like
2212160	2213160	this happened.
2213160	2214160	Would it.
2214160	2215160	We'll just get you a new one.
2215160	2221160	It's like are you not aware that we were attached to this.
2221160	2226160	I know you're trying to be nice but they didn't know what to say.
2226160	2231160	In their defense a third my therapist tells me a third of an apology
2231160	2232160	is a commitment to change.
2232160	2234160	How do you how do you commit to change.
2234160	2237160	It was either that or we promised not to hit your next cat.
2237160	2241160	Yeah we will not hit your next cat.
2241160	2248160	I left my house once to go out and play and these are just all going to
2248160	2250160	be sad childhood stories.
2250160	2251160	Yeah.
2251160	2253160	And I played.
2253160	2255160	What do you do in an empty warehouse you know.
2255160	2260160	We don't want to bring out our fucking blue chip roast material.
2260160	2264160	Dean Martin drinks ladies and gentlemen.
2264160	2267160	There were a couple victories in life though.
2267160	2268160	I bring it.
2268160	2269160	I bring it.
2269160	2274160	I ran out into the end of the neighborhood and played for several
2274160	2279160	hours and came home and my mom was waiting on the porch and she said
2279160	2284160	do you remember me telling you as you left to bring the kitten inside.
2284160	2291160	So we had a new kitten and it was it was on a leash to let it play
2291160	2297160	outside and a collar and then and I said no I don't remember still
2297160	2302160	don't remember mom that instruction.
2302160	2311160	I'll take your word for it but it's not going to bring Mr.
2311160	2313160	T back.
2313160	2321160	I don't think it was Mr. T that died but apparently there was a tomato
2321160	2328160	tower in the garden next to the front door and it was on this long like
2328160	2335160	kind of just leash line like a lightweight clothesline kind of thing
2335160	2338160	that was like long enough to let it like explore and play.
2338160	2340160	And he loved tomatoes.
2340160	2344160	And he loved walking in circles around the perimeter of tomato towers
2344160	2350160	and didn't wasn't a primate so did not have the thought of doing the
2350160	2353160	opposite of what you've been doing when it gets hard to breathe.
2353160	2358160	So it just kept apparently it just hung itself just like and my mom
2358160	2360160	informed me of this.
2360160	2365160	I didn't have to come home to it but I did have to hear the story and
2365160	2369160	definitely the headline was that it was my fault.
2369160	2370160	You should have.
2370160	2374160	I do like the style choice of ask the question.
2374160	2377160	Do you remember when I told you to bring the cat in?
2377160	2378160	Do you remember that?
2378160	2379160	Oh you don't remember?
2379160	2382160	Well that explains why the cat's dead.
2382160	2385160	It's kind of a it's a pretty clever tactic.
2385160	2389160	It's like because because it'd be like if it's like yeah I do remember
2389160	2394160	she if she was making it up she'd be like oh sweet fucking hey then you
2394160	2397160	should have done it motherfucker because you killed your cat and then
2397160	2402160	she'd be like she'd go into a room and like whoa fuck.
2402160	2407160	In your defense he could have been dead before she asked you to bring
2407160	2410160	you know he could have been there from the day before.
2410160	2411160	I don't know when the last time was.
2411160	2413160	Yeah well I don't remember why.
2413160	2414160	I don't know the timeline.
2414160	2416160	Well I don't think we weren't like we're not like hillbillies we didn't
2416160	2420160	like leave our cat out for two days and not know it was just like it was
2420160	2421160	like a rare thing to like.
2421160	2422160	Yeah.
2422160	2426160	You know it's like we weren't it it was but this thing is I don't
2426160	2427160	remember.
2427160	2429160	I don't fuck mom.
2429160	2431160	No I don't remember that you're grown.
2431160	2432160	Yeah.
2432160	2433160	I don't fucking 44.
2433160	2436160	I've been trying to remember it my whole life.
2436160	2440160	You know what I don't fucking remember you saying that cat was fuck you.
2440160	2442160	I want to know what a tomato tower is.
2442160	2447160	It's like a is it the little pyramid thing that you it's like a more like
2447160	2448160	a cylinder.
2448160	2453160	I would say you know with a slightly wire.
2453160	2455160	Yeah it's why it's a wire cylinder.
2455160	2456160	Yeah.
2456160	2459160	Like a slight it's not quite a true cylinder because the top is a little
2459160	2461160	lesser diameter than the bottom.
2461160	2465160	It's kind of like a tower of Pisa kind of that's not accurate but but like
2465160	2466160	it's like a.
2466160	2467160	Tomato towers.
2467160	2468160	Tower.
2468160	2469160	Tomato towers.
2469160	2476160	I guess the idea is that the tomato will get born and then grab the tower
2476160	2479160	and I guess the idea is that you don't want your kitten to do that.
2479160	2482160	You don't want it to like cling to the tower the way a tomato does.
2482160	2484160	They don't make kitten towers.
2484160	2485160	Nope.
2485160	2486160	Nope.
2486160	2490160	Maybe at the Humane Society they have they have an array of those in the
2490160	2491160	back.
2491160	2493160	Come on back here guys.
2493160	2495160	Here's some tomato towers.
2495160	2496160	Have a blast.
2496160	2498160	We'll be back in 10 minutes.
2498160	2500160	They'll all be dead.
2500160	2503160	We we we love our pets.
2503160	2504160	We love animals.
2504160	2506160	We love our innocent dogs and cats.
2506160	2513160	We we are able to touch emotions when we think about them that we are not
2513160	2516160	able to access when we think about human beings.
2516160	2517160	Give me a beat.
2525160	2526160	Yo.
2526160	2528160	This goes out to all the pets I killed.
2528160	2529160	Sorry Rover.
2529160	2530160	Sorry muffin.
2530160	2531160	Sorry.
2531160	2534160	Sorry about all the stuffing that I let you eat.
2534160	2536160	I choke on to death.
2536160	2537160	Sorry.
2537160	2539160	Sorry Beth.
2539160	2542160	About the cat that I shot with my BB gun.
2544160	2546160	Through the eye.
2548160	2549160	Why?
2549160	2551160	I'm a sociopath.
2551160	2557160	Be a serial killer but I don't have bravery or a support system.
2558160	2561160	Jeffrey Dahmer is in the house tonight.
2561160	2562160	Clean out that crawl space.
2562160	2565160	Play with the bones tonight.
2565160	2566160	Squirrel bones.
2566160	2567160	Chipmunk bones.
2567160	2569160	Decapitated heads.
2569160	2571160	Ed Kemper in effect.
2571160	2575160	Fucked his mother's head after her death.
2575160	2576160	Cut her head off.
2576160	2578160	Just to make her stop talking.
2578160	2581160	Turn her off.
2581160	2582160	Man.
2582160	2584160	Mindhunter.
2585160	2588160	Cruelty to animals.
2588160	2594160	It's the number one sign according to the FBI that you're going to make people die when
2594160	2596160	you become a person that's grown up.
2596160	2599160	So don't let your kids torture your pups.
2599160	2600160	Take them to the therapist.
2600160	2602160	Say fix this bitch.
2602160	2609160	Don't wait to stitch nine stitches instead of doing a stitch in time.
2609160	2612160	A stitch in time saves nine with a sociopath.
2613160	2614160	Put that kid in the bath.
2614160	2615160	Hold their head down.
2615160	2617160	Maybe drown your kid.
2617160	2620160	Might save a couple hundred people's kids.
2620160	2625160	If your kid's already dumb and you know that, then just take your thumb and put it over
2625160	2630160	there, trachea, and push until you hear a pop.
2637160	2641160	If you think it's going to be a murderer.
2641160	2644160	Otherwise don't kill your kid.
2646160	2647160	Yo.
2647160	2650160	But here's what MC Licorice did.
2650160	2652160	Yo, I'm MC Licorice.
2652160	2654160	What I did was kind of ridiculous.
2654160	2657160	I started a shelter for wayward youth.
2657160	2658160	Children at risk.
2658160	2660160	This is what we do.
2660160	2665160	We make them play foosball and weave baskets and go to the mall and we take them to the
2665160	2667160	zoo and say, look at those lions.
2667160	2670160	And they don't grow up to be death trying.
2670160	2675160	They grow up to be lawyers and doctors and they work for Gamble and they work for Proctor.
2675160	2681160	My name is MC Licorice and I took a proactive stance, tried to turn shit around.
2681160	2683160	Way to high road me.
2683160	2685160	MC Licorice.
2685160	2690160	Sorry, I wasn't as fucking optimistic as you.
2690160	2693160	I don't believe half the shit you just said.
2693160	2695160	Why don't you come over here instead?
2695160	2697160	Try talking that shit to me instead of behind my back.
2697160	2699160	Does it seem like it's behind your back?
2699160	2700160	Fucking idiot.
2700160	2701160	It's the microphone.
2701160	2702160	Oh shit.
2702160	2704160	You tough guy when you're alone.
2705160	2707160	Alright, I'm coming over there.
2707160	2708160	Oh shit.
2718160	2720160	Let me go Jackson.
2723160	2724160	Fuck you.
2724160	2725160	Fuck you.
2726160	2728160	We just had an awkward fight.
2728160	2730160	My shirts are all stretched to the right.
2730160	2734160	Big collars both turned out to fight like pussies.
2734160	2737160	It's embarrassing for both of us.
2737160	2743160	MC Licorice and me, Stan Schmengel.
2745160	2750160	The sociopathic, non-cereal killer animal torturer.
2750160	2754160	I'll tell you about the time that I took a knife and I threatened a giraffe
2754160	2755160	for its life.
2755160	2758160	I said, give me your wallet or stoop down.
2758160	2759160	He said, I got too long a neck.
2759160	2760160	I'm not going to clown around.
2760160	2763160	I got to eat leaves that are way up high.
2763160	2764160	I said, motherfucking giraffe.
2764160	2765160	Now you're going to die.
2765160	2767160	Give me all your money.
2767160	2768160	He said, I don't have none.
2768160	2769160	I said, that's right son.
2769160	2770160	That's right son.
2770160	2773160	You're a broke ass giraffe because I'm a prime mate.
2773160	2774160	And I'll tell you what I do.
2774160	2779160	I lift weights in the penitentiary just to get strong.
2779160	2782160	I didn't spend too long rehabilitating.
2782160	2784160	I just came in the safari.
2784160	2789160	I'm going to fucking rob wild game.
2789160	2791160	It's what I do.
2791160	2792160	Rhinos.
2792160	2793160	Give me your money.
2793160	2794160	Okay.
2794160	2795160	Oh, God.
2795160	2796160	Yeah.
2796160	2797160	No.
2797160	2799160	Why did I think that rap wouldn't be horrible and dark?
2799160	2800160	Really?
2800160	2802160	When I said, give me a beat after talking about animal cruelty.
2802160	2803160	It got a little bit dark.
2803160	2808160	I never shot an animal with a BB gun in case anyone thinks that's how freestyling
2808160	2809160	works.
2809160	2810160	Certainly not in the eye.
2810160	2811160	Certainly not in the eye.
2811160	2812160	I never have been cruel to an animal.
2812160	2813160	If you had some support.
2813160	2814160	Yeah.
2814160	2815160	That was my favorite line.
2815160	2824160	You did bring up a good point also about cruelty to animals being such an indicator for future
2824160	2827160	sociopathic tendencies.
2827160	2831160	It seems like if you are a person that is cruel to animals, they should just put you
2831160	2832160	in jail.
2832160	2833160	That would save so many human lives.
2833160	2834160	Yeah.
2834160	2835160	How many times did you hear when you were a kid?
2835160	2836160	Of course.
2836160	2839800	Some asshole in the neighborhood that did some fucked up thing to a cat or something and
2839800	2840800	bragged about it.
2840800	2842800	It's like they can't help but brag about it.
2842800	2853000	They don't all become serial killers, but that's just because they don't ... Whatever.
2853000	2859640	It doesn't even matter what your stance is about animals, whether you're PETA, full-blown,
2859640	2864680	no animals should ever be hurt, and the eggs you ate this morning are a crime and stuff,
2864680	2869640	or if you're way over on the other side and are like, no, if it's not a cuddly, adorable
2869640	2874160	dog, I don't give a fuck about animals, or even if you're the kind of person that hates
2874160	2876440	cats and shit.
2876440	2880080	People that are just like ... They torture animals.
2880080	2886520	They do shit to cats and stuff where they fuck with them, just to fuck with them.
2886520	2888800	Why not just lock those people up?
2888800	2889800	Yeah.
2889800	2890800	Yeah.
2890800	2892440	It does seem to be an indicator.
2892440	2898640	It's like, why would you have fun doing that?
2898640	2903720	That's the thing is we sort of ... If you merge the two, being disrespectful to women
2903720	2909480	and animals, there's this whole culture that we kind of got to rethink violence, because
2909480	2912720	I think we got lazy with it and we were sort of like, well, that's violent, but that's
2912720	2916280	not violent, and this is okay to watch, and this is okay to show, and we're sort of at
2916280	2920600	a place where it looks like we might want to look at all of that again, and that might
2920600	2924800	be one of the first things we do, is be like, animals.
2924800	2927880	Let's start with animals and work our way up to humans.
2927880	2928880	We're women.
2928880	2929880	Yeah.
2929880	2930880	That is what we're implying.
2930880	2931880	Because it's rough.
2931880	2932880	Yeah.
2932880	2933880	Yeah.
2933880	2937680	Where are we headed?
2937680	2943040	I think my optimistic view of it is that we are roto-tilling the fabric of society right
2943040	2944040	now.
2944040	2945040	Yeah.
2945040	2948600	That's the theory I've heard other people mention also, which I ...
2948600	2952280	Just jackhammering the concrete, and it's like, of course, that's not going to feel
2952280	2955320	comfortable or even righteous.
2955320	2962560	It's going to just feel insane, and every day someone says, all right, that's enough,
2962560	2965760	because it's a friend of theirs, or someone that's like, what, him?
2965760	2966760	No.
2966760	2967760	That's enough.
2967760	2972400	Or this specific story is like, well, if that's ... All right, that's enough.
2972400	2981640	And I think it's just like a jackhammering of the concrete, and then hopefully then,
2981640	2987840	if we could just observe while we're doing that, that instead of there being a backlash
2987840	2996480	that maybe this is the ticket to, oh, we start to adopt a code and a principle where we go,
2996480	3004760	okay, I subscribe to the equivalent of the Asimov's rules of robotics or something.
3004760	3010440	There's like a lost three rules, a litmus test you can rattle off before you have a
3010440	3016080	human encounter, whatever it is, and you go like, okay, so who's harming who or who's
3016080	3017080	getting away with that?
3017080	3018080	I don't know.
3018080	3024120	There's some code, and that's a religion that comes up out of it where it's not about men
3024120	3028440	versus women or people of color versus white people or whatever.
3028440	3034120	It stops being that because it becomes so chaotic, and it becomes so like, what, Mr.
3034120	3035240	Rogers did that?
3035240	3043000	Oh, no, and all of these heroes or funny people are tumbling, and there's all this crazy shit
3043000	3046840	until we're all so confused that we all cry out at once for order.
3046840	3049720	They go, then tell us what to do.
3049720	3052200	Tell us how to think.
3052200	3055360	Tell me something to tattoo on my arm so that I can just look at it.
3055360	3061560	Give me a symbol of a shamrock or a circle with three dots on it or something that could
3061560	3068160	represent the three acid tests of whether or not you're good or evil, and then it can
3068160	3074280	just be about people that subscribe to that belief system versus people that don't, because
3074280	3079560	the belief system I have built into it, as does animal cruelty, a kind of like, well,
3079560	3082440	why would you bother fighting this?
3082440	3087680	Then there would be people going, I don't believe in that circle with two dots thing.
3087680	3088680	Why?
3089200	3094800	No one told you to get the tattoo, but why are you so scared about that?
3094800	3096760	What slippery slope is there for you?
3096760	3103360	Then we could just choke those people to death, put them in prison.
3103360	3107360	The Al Franken thing is sort of something that you just said, which was that when they
3107360	3112120	find out Mr. Rogers has done something weird, and it's so frustrating to hear people sort
3112120	3116640	of defend him because you're at this point where you're like, the world assumed that
3116640	3121040	only people you didn't like were going to be found guilty, and it's sort of a wake-up
3121040	3125560	call to say, it's going to be guys that you like, it's going to be people you love, fathers
3125560	3130200	and brothers, and we have to say we have the same standard across the board.
3130200	3136760	I'm sure the Al Franken story is getting pretty close to, I'm pretty sure, within 10 years.
3136760	3141400	I don't think there's probably not a photo you could dig up of me honking some titties,
3141400	3151640	and I don't think I ever ... I would expect that sooner or later, if we were
3151640	3158280	going to put a black light over my entire life, 40 years, that there's got to be some
3158280	3164560	narrative where I'm way out of line in my past, and I'm definitely not pretending to
3164560	3165560	not remember.
3165560	3171280	I don't know if ... But what I do know is that if there was, if there was some like,
3171280	3175760	if someone said something, it was like, oh yeah, I was doing a show with Dan Harmon,
3175760	3180520	and he blah, blah, blah, and he did this and that, and I would go, if it was true, I would
3180520	3185760	go, okay, yeah, that's true, and that was fucked up, yeah.
3185760	3188800	I either was just reminded of that because of the story, or I've been thinking about
3188800	3193000	that for a long time, and I'm really embarrassed about that blah, blah, blah.
3193000	3195800	Isn't that basically how Al Franken responded?
3195800	3201640	I don't know if his apology was suitable or whatever, but what's the big ... It's like
3201640	3208640	if you didn't actually ... It should be okay for there to just be like, oh yeah, by the
3208640	3216040	way, here's some shit sprayed on you, here's a little dye pack on you from 2005, and you
3216040	3219480	should be able to go, yep, sorry, and then ...
3219800	3225320	The key is evolution, in that if we found something about you in 1998, and then you
3225320	3230560	were still doing it in 2006, sort of like in a Louis situation, I think then people
3230560	3234920	are angry, but if we found out that when you were 18, you were inappropriate, but now as
3234920	3238800	a grown ass man, there's never been a case again against you, then we see that you've
3238800	3242960	evolved, and I think that's what people are asking for, and I think that's the thing that
3242960	3244480	separates cases.
3244480	3249320	I think the crucial things are cover up, dishonesty, stuff like that, like yeah, if there's a trail
3249320	3255920	of like, no, yeah, I'm going to keep doing this, and I'm going to lie about it, or if
3255920	3260840	it comes forward, and then the person's response is like, that didn't happen, okay, then it
3260840	3265400	turns out it did happen, then it's like, okay, but do you understand that that doesn't bode
3265400	3267160	well because you're not?
3267160	3270680	That means that if you could get away with it, you would, as opposed to like, oh, did
3270680	3271680	I do that?
3271680	3272680	Urkel.
3272680	3273680	We'll call it the Urkel.
3273680	3274680	The Urkel affection.
3274680	3278680	Just say, did I do that?
3278680	3283520	Just remember Urkel, the Urkel principle, how do you spell Urkel, and then we'll make
3283520	3290120	up like an acronym for the ... Yeah, how did that come up?
3290120	3291120	I don't know.
3291120	3297000	Oh, the Al Franken thing, I guess, yeah, because it's like, well, yeah, he's a senator.
3297000	3301560	I think we should assume that all politicians are fucking creeps for sure, right?
3301560	3303680	Yeah, there's going to be a ... Why are you shaking your head?
3303680	3305000	Oh, because of Maxine Waters?
3305000	3306000	You're so fucking racist.
3307000	3309000	What about Kamala Harris?
3309000	3310000	I'm not racist.
3310000	3312000	Oh, she's black too.
3312000	3318360	There's definitely going to be a ton of old white men in DC, like they get fucking purged
3318360	3319360	from this.
3319360	3321000	I mean, on both sides, I'm sure, you know?
3321000	3328240	I mean, it just should be no shock to anybody that a senator of any state ... And no, that
3328240	3332680	should not be okay, and I'm glad it's no longer okay, and we should expect that every single
3332680	3337480	fucking one of them is going to have somebody come forward and say ... Yeah, because people
3337480	3344280	with power ... My therapist said, she's a married lesbian, and she said that ...
3344280	3345840	Did she watch the show?
3345840	3347040	No, I don't think so.
3347040	3352200	If she does, she's smart enough to pretend she doesn't, because then I think it'd feel
3352200	3357880	like it would ding our therapy or something, but she uses family guy references to make
3357880	3358880	her points.
3358880	3361240	She's like, sometimes Peter Griffin has an angel on his shoulder ...
3361240	3362240	No, she doesn't.
3362240	3366560	I'm like, I have a cartoon you could use.
3366560	3367560	I know.
3367560	3368800	That is hilarious.
3368800	3372800	I would love to see your face when she says ... It's exact.
3372800	3376040	I'm like, yeah, great.
3376040	3379000	The third time she did a family guy reference, I was like, are you trying?
3379000	3380880	We're going to have to have ... He's like, well, he's in comedy.
3380880	3382480	He'll appreciate that I'm trying.
3382480	3388400	I'm going to need to see you twice a week because of your references are fucking me up.
3388400	3389920	When do I get some validation?
3389920	3390920	Hilarious.
3390920	3391920	I get it.
3391920	3394240	I get to go with the need for that, but do you have to ...
3394240	3399080	Wait until she starts to talk about it like she doesn't know you're associated with it.
3399080	3400960	You should have seen on Rick and Morty.
3400960	3401960	Do you watch that show?
3401960	3406200	Anyway, Dan, you should have seen on Rick and Morty.
3406200	3408760	She said, listen, it's power.
3408760	3414360	The studies and the anecdotal evidence show, even in the psychological community, women
3414360	3423320	who are not only women but they work in the shrink industry, there's still ways to become
3423320	3430440	empowered as a person to the point where your mind starts to bend and it just happens less
3430440	3435460	because women are ... Because we've gaslit them into ... They don't get as many chances
3435460	3441720	to be in such power that they can find out ... She's saying it's human.
3441720	3444000	It's a person in power thing.
3444640	3447680	I don't think it's a split equal thing.
3447680	3454320	It's going to take decades to convince me that guys aren't neurologically more fucked
3454320	3455320	up.
3455320	3465700	It just seems ... I do believe her when she says, anybody that gets a ton of power over
3465700	3470520	another human being, you have to go into that situation with your shit together.
3470520	3474080	That is not going to bring your shit together in that situation.
3474080	3480680	There's just syndromes of powerful women that will just psychologically torture the dudes
3480680	3482840	underneath them.
3482840	3488640	I think it's probably a smarter and more awesome ... It's sexist that when we think about it,
3488640	3495760	we go like, that would be awesome, but anyways, why did that come up?
3495760	3498880	Because you'd said ... Kamala Harris.
3498880	3499880	She's sexually harassed.
3500700	3509480	That's why I'm saying all senators, we should just ... There's no harm that can come from
3509480	3514520	assuming that all senators are liars, thieves.
3514520	3520800	It is not our patriotic duty to think that someone in office is a good person or honorable.
3520800	3527440	It is arguably a patriotic duty to be skeptical and assume the worst about our servants.
3527480	3533840	Do you think that this will swing around on Trump or will they just continue to say, that
3533840	3534840	happened a long time?
3534840	3535840	Then that's not true.
3535840	3536840	I don't know.
3536840	3537840	I don't know.
3537840	3539480	I don't know if they ... It's like this elephant in the room.
3539480	3543680	Somebody was mentioning that it's like ... Him tweeting about Al Franken made blood come
3543680	3544680	out of my ears.
3544680	3545680	It's so crazy.
3545680	3550200	But also tweeting about it like a little poopy boy, who's like, oh, guess where his hands
3550200	3552320	went in picture two and three.
3552320	3556240	He's like, okay, bad at being a billionaire.
3556240	3557240	We knew that.
3557240	3559000	Bad at being president.
3559000	3561960	Then it turned out we were marveling at, wow, he's bad at being Hitler.
3561960	3563200	Wow, that's a relief.
3563200	3565520	He's being bad at being Hitler.
3565520	3572840	I never expected he'd be bad at sexual harassment, bad at parsing a titty-honk photo.
3572840	3573840	Do you think it's a slave?
3573840	3577160	He thinks it's a missing ... He thinks it's a beginning of a slide show.
3577160	3579360	Yeah, there's a whole lot.
3579360	3581800	He's bad at being a douchebag.
3581800	3586240	He's bad at looking at that photo and just going, oh, who looks like he grabbed him
3587240	3591520	He's like ... There's a couple of ways to interpret his response.
3591520	3597480	One is that he looked at that photo and was like, okay, fine, but you know that shit got
3597480	3602560	bad in the subsequent photos, because he didn't look at it as a bad thing.
3602560	3603560	Yes.
3603560	3606600	Because in his world, he's used to getting busted for so much more.
3606600	3611680	He's like, if that was number one, God knows what two through five are.
3611680	3617360	The other way to interpret it is that he got a hard-on and was just sharing it with
3617360	3618360	America.
3618360	3623440	It was just going like, whoa, look at that.
3623440	3627320	Did all of his accusers just get paid off?
3627320	3629520	How did that all just go away?
3629520	3630720	I don't know.
3630720	3633480	I don't know.
3633480	3638080	All I know is that people are ... When people say, oh, but what about this guy?
3638080	3642680	I was like, well, let them run their sexual predator guy.
3642680	3645960	Why are we trying to pull him out of the race and all this stuff?
3645960	3650920	If you pull him out of the race, they've already learned that it's neck and neck with the pedophile
3650920	3654880	running, so they're just going to find a non-pedophile.
3654880	3656720	They would love for him to be disqualified.
3656720	3658280	That's a do-over.
3658280	3664760	I was making that argument like, just run your pedophile, and then he's going to win.
3665520	3668360	Then let the games begin.
3668360	3673600	I know that there's this bigger chess game where, oh, we got to topple the majority,
3673600	3681080	but that's how they're thinking so much that they're running a pedophile.
3681080	3686200	It's not like, oh, be Christ-like and just let them run the game, but when there's that
3686200	3694560	much tumult to the point where they're banging shoes on the table saying ... It's like, okay,
3694920	3696560	there's a larger loss here for them.
3696560	3697560	Yeah.
3697560	3698560	I think they should.
3698560	3700440	They should be forced to run that guy.
3700440	3705560	Why should that ... I mean, obviously, they don't have to cede him once he wins the election.
3705560	3706560	Yeah.
3706560	3709600	I mean, there's ... Yeah.
3709600	3711040	I think that-
3711040	3718080	How bad would it be to lose to the pedophile, to be the fucking ... I mean, that's your
3718080	3719080	claim to fame.
3719080	3720080	Hey, yeah.
3720080	3721080	Particularly because-
3721080	3722080	I lost to the pedophile in Alabama.
3722080	3726600	I hear that went after the people who killed the four girls in a church that they were
3726600	3728960	blown out of, so that even sends a larger message.
3728960	3731480	The fact that it's neck and neck is terrifying.
3731480	3732960	I don't think it's neck and neck anymore.
3732960	3737080	Not anymore, but it was eight points three days ago and now we're up to four points back
3737080	3738080	again.
3738080	3739080	Oh, really?
3739080	3740080	These are also polls in Alabama.
3740080	3741680	These are like phone polls.
3741680	3745240	What kind of idiot is picking up their landline in Alabama?
3745240	3746240	Tammy Sessions.
3746240	3747240	Hello?
3747240	3755560	He saw the headline that said that ... God, it was some statistic about like, I'm pulling
3755560	3760360	this number out of my ass, but it was like the actual numbers I'm pulling out of my ass,
3760360	3769040	but it was like six out of 10 evangelicals in Alabama say that now that they know about
3769040	3772040	this, they're-
3772040	3773040	Resending their endorsement.
3773040	3775400	No, they want to vote for them twice or whatever.
3775400	3776400	Oh, God.
3776400	3780280	They're doubling down, however they express that, that they're more likely to vote for
3780280	3781280	them now.
3781280	3782280	How is there even a degree?
3782280	3783280	Was that a continuum?
3783280	3789040	Now I'm more likely to vote for one of two people, where it's a binary decision between
3789040	3792000	whether I'm in my mind, whether I'm good or evil.
3792000	3794240	Now I'm more likely to double down.
3794240	3799240	The most brilliant move, talking about playing chess, was the robocall thing of like, oh,
3799240	3807000	let's have a fake Jew from the Washington Post calling and like, murking around, looking
3807000	3815840	for more dirt on him, just to sully the whole media, just to fan the flames of resentment.
3815840	3816840	I didn't hear about that.
3816840	3820120	It was a false flag robocall.
3820120	3826800	It was a robocall in Alabama, a real robocall that went out, and you got to hear it.
3826800	3827800	It's amazing.
3828360	3830360	Yeah, it's a recording.
3830360	3835920	It's like, this is Bernie Bernstein from The Washington Post, and I'm looking for some
3835920	3843400	information about, what's his name, about whoever, I forgot the guy's name, and they're
3843400	3848920	like, if you have any tips, no questions asked, I pay $5,000, call this number, blah, blah,
3848920	3856960	blah, blah, just so that, just to muddy the water so that people are confused about whether
3856960	3862040	or not that's real and whether or not the process of finding that information is, and
3862040	3868440	just to throw doubt on whether or not any of that information is real.
3868440	3872120	Most people said things like, I don't know about the timing.
3872120	3874080	The timing's kind of weird.
3874080	3875680	It's weird that it would come up right now.
3875680	3876680	Yeah.
3876680	3879960	Wait, what do you mean the timing of finding out?
3879960	3884560	These allegations from all these women are from like 40 years ago, and this guy's had
3884560	3886320	a long career.
3886320	3888200	So they're saying, why would it come up now?
3888200	3891120	That seems weird to them.
3891120	3896840	They're not taking into account that there could be this movement going on where, and
3896840	3901760	they feel empowered or emboldened to speak out and to speak up, and they didn't before.
3901760	3904400	Also, the cover-up was 40 years.
3904400	3909240	Well, I didn't know it was under, that's so weird, like, yeah, who gives a shit if it's
3909240	3915880	politically motivated to come forward and say, well, that's such a great excuse, oh,
3915880	3916880	that's politically motivated.
3916880	3917880	Those are my political enemies.
3917880	3918880	Does it make it untrue?
3918880	3919880	Yes.
3919880	3920880	They are your political enemies, of course.
3920880	3922760	That's how that works, the job that you want.
3922760	3923760	Yeah.
3923760	3927400	Man, the audience is going crazy.
3927400	3934360	Well, you know, you gotta, most people are just listening to this, and it's like a regular
3934360	3935360	podcast.
3935360	3936360	They're at the gym, yeah.
3936360	3937360	Yeah.
3937360	3942280	The subscribers get the treat of, it's kind of like a Neil Hamburger-y kind of bit, like
3942280	3945520	there's no audience, so it feels just awkward enough to-
3945520	3947760	I didn't mean that the audience listening is going crazy.
3947760	3951080	I was joking about the live audience here.
3951080	3952080	Yeah.
3952080	3957360	What if we had cardboard cutouts of people?
3957360	3961240	Somebody did once suggest that we fill it with mannequins and then said that Dan would
3961240	3963440	not be able to concentrate.
3963440	3967400	Shout out to Reddit.
3967400	3969680	Yeah.
3969680	3973160	That's another exciting thing about all this, like, you know, allegations and all this stuff
3973160	3977880	is like, unless- I assume we're not going to start kink-shaming, right?
3977880	3981760	Because especially, like, if you're- it's like, I kind of like, I never set out to be
3981760	3986040	a hero by jerking off on a mannequin leg, but because that's a victimless crime, I'm
3986040	3989800	kind of like an accidental, like, King Arthur here.
3989800	3994160	Let's go ahead and bring those six legs out for their testimony right now.
3994160	3997240	Like I just happened to- that's the other thing I want to be careful about.
3997240	4000480	That's why I've been, like, careful to let go, like, well, let's talk about the silence
4000480	4003200	and let's- guys, let's take account about the way we're treating women and all that
4003200	4006560	stuff because I don't want- because otherwise I'm in the catbird seat and I didn't want
4006560	4009840	to be- because I didn't shoot- that's not by choice.
4009840	4012920	That's no more by choice than if I was born, like, gay or something like that.
4012920	4018880	Like, my proclivities don't happen to involve, like, uh, like-
4018880	4019880	Living people.
4019880	4020880	Yeah.
4020880	4025040	Like, well, I mean, but they- I'm not, you know, but I mean, they do.
4025040	4030440	My proclivities involve my living girlfriend, Cody, but I just mean, like, I don't, like,
4030440	4036960	I- it just- a YouTube video goes so far, you know, like, it doesn't- I never really-
4036960	4042400	I don't have the biology, I don't think, that results in, like, being so frustrated with
4042400	4047600	a woman for not letting you assault her that you have to jerk off in a potted plant, like,
4047600	4050700	while she watches just to- just to get your life back.
4050700	4055840	But whenever- anything that involves, like, coming, craving and all that stuff, I- I'm
4055840	4062200	always, like, even though it's, like, really easy to vilify the- the creepy people, like,
4062200	4066360	I know, like, I'm creepy, you know, like, I'm just not- I just don't happen to be creepy
4066360	4070600	in a way that, like, would ever bring me into an intersection where somebody else was getting
4070600	4074880	hurt without their consent, but I- I don't think that's- I don't think that's because
4074880	4075880	I'm a noble person.
4075880	4081280	I think that's because I, like, saw some pantyhose feet under the table when I was 10 years old
4081280	4084920	in the 70s or something, and, like, I don't-
4084920	4091680	so I- it's- I'm, like, because I don't want- it would be just, like, so easy to just go,
4091680	4096760	like, oh yeah, let's- let's- let's- let's find all the- all the worst people, and that's,
4096760	4099320	like, let's get rid of them.
4099320	4104680	But it's not really- it's like you can find monsters if you look for monsters.
4104680	4108560	Like, you'll just find them, but I don't think that'll- I think if you could wave a magic
4108560	4111880	wand and get rid of every guy that ever hurt a person, I don't think that would solve the
4111880	4112880	problem.
4113120	4121800	People are complex, and no one is- everyone has bad shit about them, and, you know, everyone
4121800	4124680	that is being- I mean- Different shit.
4124680	4128800	Yeah, not to- not to tie it back to what we were talking about, but, you know, all of
4128800	4132520	those people are still gonna be in society and living, and, like, they were charged with
4132520	4138660	whatever sexual misconduct or sexual assault, or, like, they have families and kids, and
4138660	4142280	they love their kids, and, you know, they- sometimes- I'm not defending any of those
4142280	4149000	people, but I'm saying that people are complicated, and good people do bad things, and so how
4149000	4150400	do we deal with that, you know?
4150400	4155800	Yeah, we have to make this about, like, how do we- how do we fix society, not- if we-
4155800	4160880	if we- it'll be the easy way out to make it into a, okay, got this one, that one, that
4160880	4161880	one, that one.
4161880	4164120	Yeah, just some symbolic bullshit, yeah.
4164120	4169600	Because for a couple reasons, one is, like, just your classic scientific reason, which
4169600	4175520	is, like, the same reason your doctor tells you, you gotta finish these antibiotics.
4175520	4179000	You can't just take them until you don't have the sniffles anymore, and then throw them
4179000	4180000	in the garbage.
4180000	4183560	You gotta keep taking them after you feel good, because you're- if you're- if there's
4183560	4189560	a couple left, they're just gonna be really good at being- making you sick.
4189560	4195120	So the metaphor there is, like, do we really want to just find the Weinstein's, hang them
4195120	4197880	from the highest tree, and then what's left?
4197880	4203760	Oh, the super secret agent predators that, like, never get caught.
4203760	4209440	The Kevin Costner's in Mr. Pottery Lacker, what's that movie?
4209440	4214960	Mr. Brooks, either- the Mr. Brooks's out there will remain, you know, watching the Weinstein
4214960	4221200	corpse swaying, and they'll be like, okay, back to work.
4221200	4231000	With my Jeff Daniels, or William Hurt, Tyler Durden, and my SUV guiding me.
4231000	4236320	You know you want to- come on, come on, you know you want to go and do it.
4236320	4238720	Come on, let's go kill some more people.
4238720	4241840	That's a pretty good William Hurt, come on.
4241840	4245000	I never tried William Hurt, just fucking did it.
4245000	4249840	So when is anyone ever gonna appreciate me for the fucking, like, accidental rich little
4249840	4250840	than I am?
4251480	4258000	I'll just think aside, I can do a perfect impression of any celebrity once.
4258000	4260320	I'll never be able to do William Hurt ever again.
4260320	4262000	You guys know that you were astounded.
4262000	4264360	It was pretty great.
4264360	4265640	He's playing deep cuts tonight.
4265640	4270920	But then someone will say, do your William Hurt, and I'll go, do you guys want to hear
4270920	4278840	my impression of the beginning of the Sword and Stone- Sword and Scale podcast?
4278840	4282080	Do they have a disclaimer guy?
4282080	4286920	You know, I'm not gonna recognize this, but I'm gonna act like I do.
4286920	4289680	Sword and Scale- oh shit, I can't do it now.
4289680	4292400	Sword and- wait, fuck.
4292400	4294400	Can I do it privately?
4294400	4298920	Sword and Scale, but- Sword and- Sword and Scale contains violence
4298920	4299920	and adult theme.
4299920	4302360	No, it didn't- I was cracking Cody up with it.
4302360	4305080	See that's the thing, I did it once right, and now I can't do it.
4305080	4306080	Try it again.
4306080	4307080	Sword and Scale.
4307080	4308080	Sword and Scale.
4309040	4313760	Sword and Scale contains violence and adult themes.
4313760	4317440	Sword and Scale contains violence and adult themes.
4317440	4319160	No.
4319160	4326880	I'm Aaron Mankey, and this is Lore.
4326880	4329880	Podcast impressions.
4329880	4337800	Karina Longworth had something interesting to say about Otto Preminger.
4337800	4346880	This is the story of MGM and Charles Manson.
4346880	4351240	I was wondering if we could all try and do maybe a little bit of Ira Glass.
4351240	4353560	Is Charles Manson about to die?
4353560	4354560	Yes.
4354560	4355560	Did he already die?
4355560	4356560	It's close.
4356560	4357560	Very close, I hear.
4357560	4358560	Are people upset about that?
4358560	4359560	I should have seen him upset.
4359560	4367240	Yeah, the weird thing will be, does Charles Manson, by virtue of our culture's well-justified
4367240	4375200	penchant for irony and going lateral or correcting as we go, will Charles Manson get a worse
4375200	4378960	or better Viking funeral than Hugh Hefner?
4378960	4383560	Hugh Hefner got fucking blasted.
4383560	4386120	He lived 15 years too long.
4386120	4392960	If he had died 15 years ago, which so many people that knew him and were in the same
4392960	4398640	room with him argue that he did, that it would have just been your usual ... He would
4398640	4405360	have gotten that eulogy you'd expect of like, oh, he was an iconoclast and a rebel millionaire
4405360	4408080	that changed the culture, blah, blah, blah.
4408080	4415120	He hung on so long that he got to see, oh, yeah, see you later, you fucking monster.
4415120	4416120	Yeah.
4416120	4419360	Hadn't he sold the mansion but was still living in the mansion?
4419360	4420360	That was part of the deal.
4420360	4429040	He put the mansion up for sale with the odd caveat on the price tag that he was allowed
4429040	4431000	to live there till he died.
4431000	4432800	Small contingency clause.
4432800	4436720	And now the guy said he's going to reunite both properties because it used to be one
4436720	4437960	huge super mansion.
4437960	4438960	Oh, really?
4438960	4439960	Isn't that crazy?
4439960	4440960	I've never been there.
4440960	4443680	It seems to me like it would be a bummer.
4443680	4444680	It's a bummer.
4444680	4446520	There are parties out there and it's going to be at the Playboy Mansion.
4446520	4449040	I'm always like, that's fucking bummer.
4449040	4450040	It was a bummer.
4450600	4451960	I was there once.
4451960	4452960	Yeah.
4452960	4459040	And I think it only smelled like mildew because it was raining.
4459040	4463080	And so they did something they don't normally have to do, which is they because it was an
4463080	4471320	outdoor on the lawn part courtyard party or something and they had to unroll awnings that
4471320	4475680	I think just were only they just rolled up since the last time it rained.
4475680	4478600	And so the whole place smelled like your grandpa's sleeping bag.
4478600	4479600	Yeah.
4479600	4484680	And the buffet was sort of weird looking, sad, kind of like bad hotel-y.
4484680	4486160	Did you get that?
4486160	4487160	Yeah.
4487160	4488520	I mean, yeah.
4488520	4490000	Marlago.
4490000	4492600	More Princess Cruise Lines.
4492600	4494960	Just dark, dark.
4494960	4500480	That's where my famous David Hasselhoff story takes place, me and Shrob, where we harassed
4500480	4501480	David Hasselhoff.
4501480	4502480	At the Playboy Mansion?
4502480	4503480	Hilarious.
4503480	4510360	That's how we walked up to him and said we were just high off our asses and we were like,
4510360	4517680	we have to talk to David Hasselhoff and we go, hey, we made a pilot and it's about you.
4517680	4518680	It's inspired by you.
4518680	4521320	And he's like, you made a pilot about me?
4521320	4522320	And we were talking about Heat Vision and Jack.
4522320	4526600	We were like, yeah, it was directed by Ben Stiller and it was called Heat Vision and Jack
4526600	4531960	and it was very inspired by Knight Rider and so on and he's like, Ben Stiller, what else
4531960	4532960	did he direct?
4533720	4537360	And Shrob said, Zoolander.
4537360	4541120	Why that was his from the...
4541120	4547600	And then David Hasselhoff just processing all of this, Cox's hassle head and then goes,
4547600	4549840	Zoolander's about me?
4549840	4554920	And then Shrob and I were at his beat and we both went, yes.
4554920	4556640	And then just walked away.
4556640	4557640	That's awesome.
4557640	4559560	I'm sure he might still think that.
4559560	4560560	Yeah.
4560560	4561560	That's where we were like...
4561560	4562560	Tells people.
4563160	4565960	We weren't trying to like punk him, but we were just like, we were too high to be talking
4565960	4566960	to anybody much less.
4566960	4569880	We did a bad job, so at least we turned that into a story.
4569880	4575040	And now the only real victim of this story is going to be David Hasselhoff's lawyer because
4575040	4577080	you know that guy got a 3 a.m. phone call.
4577080	4584120	I want you to look into Zoolander, more like Zoolander, because I'm hearing that movie's
4584120	4585120	about me.
4585120	4589480	Hasselhoff at every party has to endure so many...
4589480	4593720	You know so many people have just stoned, like, we have to talk to Hassel.
4593720	4596920	Literally, it's just a barrage of people.
4596920	4602000	And fortunately for him, he's so hard to find in a crowd because he's only 7'0".
4602000	4603000	Is he really?
4603000	4604000	He's so tall.
4604000	4608840	I mean, it's like Tim Robbins, John Kuzniak, David Hasselhoff, they're like in an industry
4608840	4612640	where everyone's shocked to find out that everyone's 5'3".
4612640	4620160	You and I are tall guys relative to these tiny little fucking Cheebler, Toll House fucking
4620160	4621160	elves.
4621160	4623640	Vince Vaughn's super tall as well.
4623640	4624640	Vince Vaughn.
4624640	4625640	Yeah.
4625640	4626640	Yeah, he's tall.
4626640	4627640	Conan.
4627640	4628640	Do you know anything about Hubel's new show?
4628640	4629640	No, yeah.
4629640	4633640	I keep planning to, like, thank you, good com patrolling.
4633640	4635640	Oh, I'm not worried about that.
4635640	4637720	Hubel, Hubel, what are you plugging?
4637720	4640520	And may I congratulate you on your choice of venue to plug it?
4640520	4641520	Oh, yeah.
4642040	4643600	I mean, I'm not plugging that hard.
4643600	4649760	Yeah, we made this show for YouTube Red, which is like their new pay thing.
4649760	4651720	But but yeah, it just came out.
4651720	4653080	It's called Do You Want to See a Dead Body?
4653080	4654080	Oh, yeah.
4654080	4655080	OK.
4655080	4658800	I heard you talking about this on God damn it.
4658800	4659800	How did this get made?
4659800	4660800	Yeah.
4660800	4661800	Yeah.
4661800	4664120	And so it's basically we I used to do this bit on Funny or Die.
4664120	4670000	And we just expanded that into like a larger TV world where yeah, I just take different
4670000	4673920	comedians out to go find a fucking dead body somewhere.
4673920	4682600	Is it is it sort of like are you accomplishing even ironically a like interview while you're
4682600	4683600	going?
4683600	4684600	No, that was what we thought about.
4684600	4685600	That was going to be the right.
4685600	4689200	That was like our original idea was like, oh, it'll be like a talk show and I'll talk
4689200	4690200	to them.
4690200	4691920	But no, it's fully scripted.
4691920	4697800	So I play me and they play, you know, a weirdo version of them.
4697800	4700760	But it's always like it's very little about the body.
4700760	4715400	Have you have you met our new running character, Tiny Brandon?
4715400	4722040	Did you think that no one was going to notice you?
4722040	4723040	Tiny Brandon.
4723040	4724040	Wait.
4724040	4725040	Tiny Brandon.
4725040	4726040	Can you can you stick around a little while?
4726040	4727040	Just OK.
4727800	4736480	What I don't know, we're talking about the show about their body.
4736480	4741480	Tiny Brandon, do you are you worried about America?
4741480	4751240	You know, I open up for Kevin Hart and I see a lot of different faces also big.
4751240	4752960	I thought Tiny Brandon was a child.
4752960	4756240	I think he's he's he's an adult, but he's mentally handicapped.
4756240	4761360	Yeah, when I first saw him, I thought it was like part of the Harmon babies thing we're
4761360	4762360	launching.
4762360	4764560	It's like all of us that are like younger.
4764560	4770480	But no, I think he's yeah, I think he's yeah, he's he's he's forty eight and he's fucked
4770480	4771480	up.
4771480	4779000	Like there was a fuck up at the hospital under the podium, big bread and meat, something
4779000	4780000	like that.
4780000	4781000	I come out.
4781000	4782000	I'm tiny.
4782000	4783000	Oh, OK.
4783000	4784000	Thank you.
4784000	4785000	Tiny Brandon.
4785000	4786000	We won't.
4786000	4787000	Thank you, tiny Brandon.
4787000	4792960	Someone should make a T-shirt with tiny Brandon on someone.
4792960	4793960	Someone will do something.
4793960	4796240	We've got some very talented fans.
4796240	4797240	What I miss.
4797240	4798240	He will show.
4798240	4799240	He was talking about a show.
4799240	4800240	That's what I mean.
4800240	4801240	Yeah.
4801240	4804800	But so it's basically just an excuse for me to hang out with that person.
4804800	4807880	But it's not like a reality show.
4807880	4809160	You know, it's a scripted thing.
4809160	4815480	So supposedly famous people will drop whatever they're doing and come with me to go find
4815480	4817320	a different dead body every episode.
4817320	4820600	So not all famous people, because obviously, like I wasn't called.
4820600	4824000	No, there was no way to to use every famous person in Hollywood.
4824000	4825480	There's also so many famous people nowadays.
4825480	4831240	There's so many famous people and I put famous in quotes, but do you find a body?
4831240	4832240	Sometimes we do.
4832240	4833640	Sometimes we don't find a body.
4833640	4840040	Sometimes the guest becomes like there's one with John Cho that starts out and five
4840040	4842960	seconds into it, he falls into a thing, a quicksand.
4842960	4845360	And so the whole episode is me.
4845360	4851520	I run into town to buy some rope and then I just keep getting distracted and, you know,
4851520	4853440	getting getting, you know, harangued into something else.
4853440	4855920	And then I keep coming back to him to give him an update.
4855920	4857840	And every time he's like lower and lower in the quicksand.
4857840	4860120	So then he becomes the body, you know, that's awesome.
4860120	4865480	So but and then there's like one with Cordrie where Cordrie starts taunting this big dog
4865480	4868960	and someone's we're cutting through someone's backyard and there's this big fucking mean
4868960	4871200	dog and Cordrie starts like taunting it.
4871200	4875480	Of course, the dog breaks off his chain and the whole episode is us running full speed
4875480	4879560	away from this murdering, like very scary dog.
4879560	4883840	And so it's just dumb bits like that, you know, they're 15 minutes long, super, super
4883840	4884840	easy and silly.
4884840	4886960	And it's like my favorite favorite thing.
4886960	4889720	I know this is a dumb question and I have a show with YouTube Red.
4889720	4894000	So I can ask this question and have no idea how to answer it.
4894000	4895160	But what the fuck?
4895160	4896160	Yeah.
4896160	4897520	Maybe other people know how to answer it.
4897520	4898520	Maybe that's why they ask.
4898520	4902680	What's it what was it like to work with three to four?
4902680	4909560	I tell I've told everybody it's been really great because they let me do literally anything
4909560	4910560	like literally anything.
4910560	4912640	They were just like super psyched.
4912640	4916320	You know, I think they're just kind of getting going with a lot of their shows and trying
4916320	4918300	to get more people to come and do shows there.
4918300	4923080	So, you know, I think at the beginning, you know, like Netflix and Amazon, when they first
4923080	4927920	started, they're like, how do we how do we get good people to come make shows here?
4927920	4929960	Oh, we don't fuck with them.
4929960	4931320	So that was my experience.
4931320	4934400	They were super cool to me.
4934400	4940320	You know, I I wish that they would run fucking commercials like on TV for it and stuff like
4940320	4941320	that.
4941320	4942320	But they're like, no, no, no, we're YouTube.
4942320	4944360	We're going to put it like all around YouTube.
4944360	4946880	And I'm like, oh, OK, well, then I'll leave that to you guys.
4946880	4951360	I think they're making I'm very dubious about one.
4951360	4955040	But this also might not be an actual thing that they're doing.
4955040	4957780	This may be how they explain what they're doing to people.
4957780	4961160	They have no intention of bringing back for a second season.
4961160	4967440	But it what I'm hearing through the grapevine is that their methodology is like they're
4967440	4973600	going to they're just waiting to see how many people subscribe.
4973600	4980000	And then of that of that group of people that subscribe, like.
4980000	4985440	How many of them, based on the behaviors that are very monitorable from YouTube's cockpit,
4985440	4991000	like how many of them subscribed for your show and the like very, very meticulous, intricate,
4991000	4992780	very valuable data.
4992780	4997300	But there's this kind of aspect to it where it's like they're not it.
4997300	4999860	They're waiting to get the entire picture.
4999860	5000860	Yeah.
5000860	5001860	Yeah.
5001860	5002860	And I feel it's scary about that.
5002860	5006260	All that stuff is so measurable now, you know, like, yeah, like Netflix, no way they can
5006260	5010020	tell what you watch, how long you watch it.
5010020	5011020	Did you watch the whole thing?
5011020	5012020	Did you know?
5012020	5013020	Did you not watch it?
5013020	5014100	You know, what else you watch?
5014100	5015100	That's like that.
5015100	5019820	So that sort of stuff is scary in that, like, because, you know, none of those places have
5019820	5024420	ratings, but they have even more specific data, you know, which is.
5024420	5026660	But I would have liked your show.
5026660	5027980	It makes more sense.
5027980	5029540	Just the title makes more sense.
5029540	5031180	The premise makes more sense.
5031180	5035900	My show was it ended up being community.
5035900	5041300	But if what if eSports, you know, it was and it was like kind of like, oh, this could be
5041300	5043020	a real TV show.
5043020	5047020	And if I had known what the business plan was going to be in terms of like how you got
5047020	5051420	to pick up, yeah, I would have called my show, for instance, do you want to see a dead
5051420	5052420	body?
5052420	5057900	Like literally, because that's like the most brilliant because it's like it just I would
5057900	5065460	have leaned into some kind of hook or I would have called it like, fuck, fuck, you know,
5065460	5068380	like, oh, fuck, cool, cool dicks.
5068380	5075020	But there was a lot of talk of like TV, 14, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, this and that was
5075020	5080020	like it was like, well, that sounds weird because you like, like, that's not Amazon.
5080020	5081620	That's not Netflix.
5081620	5085140	Those other companies were just like, yeah, it is true that those companies are like,
5085140	5086380	well, we don't really know what we're doing.
5086380	5087700	So let's just start doing it.
5087700	5089180	Yeah, who wants 10 episodes?
5089180	5092740	OK, this person worked in TV, this person worked on TV.
5092740	5098540	And that I'm worried about this model, like dying on the vine a little bit, like, but
5098540	5104940	but then again, they're YouTube, so they can do it once wrong and shake it off and do it.
5104940	5106900	And then be even better than everybody.
5106900	5111260	Well, they're definitely figuring aspects of it out, I think, like, because I was worried
5111260	5116460	about that too, like the TV, 14 type approach, because I didn't want to do that.
5116460	5120860	I don't want to like make a show that's appropriate or palatable for like little kids.
5120860	5121860	Like I don't really care.
5121860	5128860	Like, all I really wanted to do is make a super fucked up funny show with our friends,
5128860	5133420	you know, and like I knew that if we did that, then that's all I can control.
5133420	5139100	Like, I can't control any of the other bullshit of the marketing and, you know, who subscribes
5139100	5141380	to it and how many people, blah, blah, blah.
5141380	5148060	So yeah, I try to approach things as I'm sure you do is just like someone gave us some money
5148060	5149060	to make this.
5149060	5151900	Let's make this thing as cool as we can, and then maybe we'll get to make more.
5151900	5152900	Who knows if we don't.
5152900	5155140	I should have approached it more like that.
5155140	5159700	But then again, that's not how TV that's not how this project got developed, like people
5159700	5164300	came in that like were excited about the eSports thing and it had an exciting take
5164300	5165300	on it.
5165300	5166740	We took it wide.
5166740	5171180	YouTube Red ended up expressing the most interest in it.
5171180	5179860	So that whole process is kind of like incompatible with the idea of and then we'll see if anyone
5179860	5186480	wants to subscribe based on zero promotion and what they click on and how long they click
5186480	5187480	on it.
5187480	5190960	I would have called my show Pussyfoot.
5190960	5197400	It would have been the adventures of Pussyfoot and the sub headline would have been like,
5197400	5199920	could a pussy be a shoe?
5199920	5205320	Like something or like I would have called it McSniblet's colon, the pussy shoe diaries,
5205320	5210440	anything that would like be trendable and like clickable and like, and would have had
5210440	5212640	like a gorilla feel to it too.
5212640	5214740	I wouldn't have tried to make Cheers.
5214740	5215820	That doesn't make any sense.
5215840	5219320	If you don't know Cheers exists and frankly, if you aren't being told by People Magazine
5219320	5222800	that Cheers is worth watching, you're not going to watch it.
5222800	5226980	So I don't know.
5226980	5228440	I think we did it wrong.
5228440	5232560	Well it's tricky for sure and our show just came out on Friday.
5232560	5238000	So I don't know, I mean, I will say this too about the name of the show has not been an
5238000	5244320	easy name in the current country that we live in because like we were going to put the show
5244320	5249980	out last month and then the Las Vegas shooting happened and YouTube was like, no, no, no,
5249980	5250980	no, no, no, no, no, no.
5250980	5253220	And they were like, you know, let's, let's move in.
5253220	5254540	I was like, yes, absolutely.
5254540	5258780	And then at a certain point you guys just do a little bit of ADR and change the name
5258780	5262660	to the show is, would you like to avoid seeing a dead body at all costs?
5262660	5267980	And it's like, I hate the only thing you can click on to guarantee you don't see one.
5267980	5269380	And there's like one coming around the corner.
5269380	5270380	Oh God.
5270380	5274160	I mean, like, you know, I've just told people like in press and stuff like, you know, this
5274160	5276360	is not me killing people.
5276360	5277840	There's no violence in the show.
5277840	5279360	It's just a fucked up treasure hunt.
5279360	5280720	You know, it's like me.
5280720	5281720	It's like stand by me.
5281720	5286760	You know, it's like, but just with like funny adults, but it's still like the name of it
5286760	5287920	scared them a lot.
5287920	5291320	I think this, you know, just as far as shit that keeps happening, you know, like they're
5291320	5293160	like, oh, yeah, we can't put it out now.
5293160	5296840	There was just, you know, well, let's wait, let's wait until these mass shootings cool
5296840	5297840	down.
5297840	5298840	Yeah.
5299100	5307180	Death goes away until until until absolute like 100 percent saturation to the point where
5307180	5312980	no one could possibly be offended because it would be like if your show was called Who
5312980	5314380	Wants to Breathe Oxygen?
5314380	5317380	Yeah, because there's just dead bodies everywhere.
5317380	5324060	But but you know what's funny about this and like a weird like Magnolia ish way is I'm
5324080	5327000	just remembering it.
5327000	5333920	Not to make us feel old, but it's got to be almost 20 years ago now when the human giant
5333920	5343920	was on MTV and I had a sketch show on VH1 and the Virginia Tech massacre happened.
5343920	5344920	Yeah.
5344920	5349760	And and it was like I think Columbine happened before that, right?
5350460	5357180	I was before Virginia Tech, but Virginia Tech was then like it was it was taken very seriously.
5357180	5359220	I didn't mean to say that in an eye rolling way.
5359220	5364140	I'm just like saying with all of us, it's like Jesus Christ, somebody send those people
5364140	5368260	a message about how serious to take death.
5368260	5376900	The but the craziest I was watching MTV, I was watching your guys show and that sketch
5376900	5378980	blood blood packed blood oath.
5379000	5384920	Yeah, yeah, it's a sketch sketch on the human giant show.
5384920	5391160	The guys are trying to decide where to where to eat lunch during their business lunch.
5391160	5396040	And they take a blood oath to yeah, we decide to go to a barbecue place.
5396040	5400520	But just in order to guarantee that no one will change their minds, we go into like the
5400520	5401920	store room of the store.
5401920	5404880	We work in like a fucking little tiny little video game store.
5405420	5409500	We're like, OK, well, let's just just so we're on the same page, like let's go take a blood
5409500	5412060	oath so that no one changes where we're going today.
5412060	5416220	You know, so we go in the back and there's just this fucking ritual where we all slice
5416220	5421620	open our hand and it becomes really gruesome and like when we drink blood and it becomes
5421620	5422640	like a bananas.
5422640	5427620	Maybe I mentioned this last time you were you were were you and shear on the show together
5427620	5428620	and on this show together.
5428620	5432000	Maybe I did I did I bring this up, I don't think so.
5432020	5437280	But yeah, so I'm watching that sketch and and the other thing is that.
5438460	5445900	Also, at the time, my my sketch show on VH1, like there was this cold open we wanted to
5445900	5451220	do where there was a sniper in the in the show or something that was like kind of an old
5451420	5455340	SCTV style thing where it was just like we would just have different gimmicks for our
5455340	5460780	wraparound. Like we wanted to just have there was a sniper loose as a cinematic trope.
5461400	5465640	Now you can't pitch that without you would think like, oh, you're doing a mass shooting
5465640	5468160	joke. It's like, no, snipers weren't that topical.
5469080	5470740	They were a cinematic trope.
5470740	5477360	Yeah. And and so it started when we wrote it, it was that and then Virginia Tech happened
5477360	5483880	and then the word came down from VH1, which is the same company Viacom.
5483880	5488480	Yeah. It's saying like, no, don't can't do this sniper sketch.
5488480	5489860	And then you turned on the TV and saw.
5490100	5492020	Well, I turned. Well, here's what I saw.
5492220	5497380	And I still and I was like, I thought I was watching it.
5497420	5501980	And then so that sketch is they take the blood oath so then it just goes insane and it's
5501980	5505740	like they're rubbing blood on each other's nipples and they're just like drinking blood
5505740	5509860	and it's going insane and it turns into this like satanic thing and there's just blood
5509860	5518460	everywhere. And in the middle of it, just quietly and unceremoniously, this giant lower
5518520	5523800	third bug comes up and it says MTV
5526560	5531360	supports the families of the victims of the Virginia Tech massacre.
5531360	5532360	Are you serious?
5533760	5538240	And it just stayed there during that sketch, like just coincidentally or they.
5538240	5539880	I didn't think it was a coincidence.
5539880	5542080	I never heard that note I got from VH1.
5542080	5544360	I was like, oh, and I parsed it in two.
5544400	5546760	I was like, oh, because we're not human giant.
5547540	5549100	Like we got to get our thing killed.
5549100	5552500	But it was. But then I thought, well, be reasonable, Dan, they already shot this.
5552580	5557060	It's airing and they killed your script.
5558180	5559380	But this couldn't be killed.
5559420	5562180	So they brought this bug up over.
5562220	5563220	Amazing.
5563460	5567220	But I don't. But then I talked to people about it later and explain that story.
5567220	5570980	And I don't know. It could have been you even said, like, no, that was that had to be
5571260	5573020	coincidence, just sheer coincidence.
5573020	5575340	But it looked like they I don't.
5576320	5581920	That would be I don't think that they are organized enough to like go through their
5581920	5587440	shows and know that there's a really violent bloody sketch airing tonight.
5587440	5591480	We should put a we should put a condolence message there.
5591480	5593680	But that is perfect timing.
5594000	5596120	And also, I don't know.
5596120	5597920	It sounds like something Viacom would do, too.
5598920	5602720	This is really perfect way of dealing with it because then the families of the victims
5602720	5603720	would be so relieved.
5603720	5604380	Oh, yeah.
5604440	5605480	They'd be watching the sketch.
5605480	5608840	They'd be watching the sketch everywhere when my brother got killed.
5608880	5610240	And so I'm feeling bad.
5610440	5611920	I think I should start flipping the channel.
5611940	5612780	Honey, wait.
5612800	5614360	Wait. Look, there's a message.
5614360	5615360	We love you.
5616040	5617160	We love you, Donald.
5618440	5619440	Fuck.
5619680	5621480	They're going to put that lower third.
5621480	5622480	I'm cool with it.
5623120	5624240	I'm cool with this sketch.
5624600	5626820	I think we killed Charles Manson.
5628000	5628800	Did he just die?
5628800	5630400	He died at 8 16.
5630680	5631680	Is that true? Yeah.
5632200	5633560	Did we kill him with our words?
5633820	5638060	I think right at the time that we were talking about him dying, he died.
5638100	5638900	We said true.
5638900	5642860	We said Manson the third time and he his his juice.
5642860	5643860	Wow.
5643860	5646500	Yeah, I don't want to become famous for that.
5647060	5648820	Maybe we were like Manson killer.
5648820	5650780	But something something tells me it was going to happen.
5650900	5651900	Wow. Yeah.
5652700	5656600	So just is there any like what was it like just old age?
5656620	5657820	Just I got it.
5657820	5658980	I got to go, guys. I'm so sorry.
5658980	5660060	I'm so upset about this.
5660060	5660900	No, no, please.
5660900	5662220	He was just like he was a cool guy.
5662400	5663680	That's the last straw right now.
5663680	5665040	No, no, no. He was just stay.
5665040	5666240	I mean, I got to go.
5666240	5666840	I got to go.
5666840	5667720	Pour some more drinks.
5667720	5668960	We should pour some more drinks.
5668960	5670720	Deal with this. I'm so sad.
5670720	5675720	He I heard he he he hung himself in his cell and his note said he's like,
5675880	5677960	look, I know what's coming.
5678200	5680000	There's a lot of allegations.
5680000	5681600	Yeah, he did it.
5681600	5683760	Fucked up. People might be talking about this.
5683760	5686880	He's like, yeah, I don't you know, this is going to ruin me.
5686880	5688000	Yeah, Manson out.
5688980	5693460	Yeah, I sexually assaulted Leslie Van Houten.
5693460	5697540	Let's just say I did not run an equitable ranch.
5698740	5701180	There will be allegations.
5701180	5703740	I don't know why he didn't get killed in the first place,
5703740	5704840	whether it wasn't a death penalty.
5704840	5707740	Well, because he I mean, this is going to sound that I know
5707740	5709840	how this is going to make me sound and maybe never.
5709840	5712380	But I was just about to go like, well, because he barely did anything.
5712380	5713740	Yeah. Yeah.
5713740	5717300	But that is the thing like I that's a 20 year old fetish I have,
5717320	5719760	not for Manson, but just for like exceptionalism.
5719760	5723420	Like, like I I just get mad or I used to get mad.
5723420	5726420	I think there's some residual shit there where I would I just get mad about
5726420	5731260	like how hypocritical we are about our treatment of prisoners, murderers,
5731260	5733660	whatever, like, like he killed.
5733660	5737600	I think he killed a couple people here and there because he was a scumbag.
5738000	5741060	But he was in prison for his entire life
5741060	5745160	because he had more influence over kids than the government.
5745640	5749780	Yeah. And I just always is like, this is horseshit, like, like, like,
5749780	5751640	I'm not that you should he should be out in the street.
5751640	5754820	But then again, also like, like, like, come on.
5754820	5758360	Like, like it like pick a lane society.
5758460	5763320	Are you as do you respect this guy or do you like, like, like, like, I don't know,
5763320	5766200	man, I remember seeing I've talked about on this podcast where I was like.
5767560	5772100	I where I saw like this this like inside the prison where he was.
5772100	5774900	And there was like this like security guard going like,
5775360	5778740	giving a tour of his cell and say and like showing all the stuff
5778740	5781040	that he was making, like these art project like he'd made
5781040	5786500	like a tarantula out of sock threads and it was like really looked like a tarantula.
5786500	5787500	Sounds badass.
5787500	5791420	This is a good night to to to Dofa the Cap to Charles Manson's Arts and Crafts.
5791760	5795800	And he he like the prison guard
5796640	5798260	set kept picking up the stuff.
5798260	5802640	Oh, it looks like he made a tarantula photo realistic tarantula out of sock threads.
5803040	5804940	You know, again, he's not supposed to be doing this
5804940	5806600	because he doesn't have his Arts and Crafts card.
5806600	5808400	He lost it in February.
5808400	5813680	And I remember watching it going like, where's your fucking card for anything?
5813680	5815280	You screw.
5815280	5819200	And there was my girlfriend, who was like a huge Roman Polanski fan
5819200	5823840	and who blames Roman Polanski's entire weekend, shall we say.
5824240	5825380	She she just blames.
5825380	5828640	She blames. That was my first fight with that girlfriend.
5829340	5832520	And I found out like she's like, why don't you marry
5832520	5834480	Charles Manson? I was like, what the fuck do you care?
5834480	5836940	What are you? And she's like, because you ruined Roman Polanski's life.
5836940	5839980	And it was like it was one of those like fights with a girlfriend
5839980	5842740	where you actually kind of fall in love like like during the fight.
5842740	5845440	Because you're like, wow, you're you're fucked up, too.
5845440	5848140	Like you you you really love Roman Polanski.
5849440	5853940	Anyways, so he died just of being an old dude.
5853940	5857080	I'm pretty sure it's just to being an old dude.
5857080	5858420	So wait, refresh my memory.
5858420	5862240	So he so he so he he just told people to kill people.
5862520	5865480	I mean, yeah, he was definitely guilty of murders throughout his life.
5865480	5868520	But I think all of the murders that he actually committed himself.
5868520	5872180	He he he was paid up on those
5872340	5874780	because our society does let you murder some people
5874780	5876420	and like serve a couple of years in prison.
5876420	5877820	And he did do that.
5877820	5881440	And then but the real reason he was in prison is because he was like a cult
5881440	5884920	leader that that inspired people to go out and kill a bunch of people.
5884920	5887180	Yeah. And I always found that a little jet.
5888080	5890540	Now I'm 44. Now he's dead.
5890860	5893860	I don't care. I'm not an iconoclast anymore.
5893860	5896360	I want my old Obama society back.
5896360	5899000	I want I just want to be.
5899000	5902960	I just want a hot cup of coffee and some hypocrisy and some drone strike
5902960	5905700	enforced fucking like first world comfort.
5905900	5908160	I'm sorry I ever talked a tall game.
5908460	5910160	I was never known Chomsky.
5910160	5911700	I was never off the grid.
5911700	5913360	I never ate any kind of pill.
5913360	5914600	I'm a fucking pussy.
5914600	5917240	And I just want I just want my comfort back.
5917240	5919740	I'm sorry I ever sided with Charles Manson.
5920880	5926280	But I just at the time I felt like if you if you if you made me pick a side
5926280	5929900	between the guy that's locked up for influencing people to murder people
5930240	5933640	and the person who's saying, yeah, he's not supposed to make this spider
5933640	5936240	because he doesn't have his arts and crafts.
5936240	5940140	I just say, I don't want to be on that team because then I'm next.
5940240	5942540	Yeah, I'm not going to tell anybody to kill anybody.
5942540	5946240	But at the time I was like, you know, maybe I'll be influencing people
5946240	5947980	from a ranch at some point.
5947980	5950440	Well, in your rap, you did. Yeah.
5950440	5952340	And it could still happen.
5952340	5953940	Give me a beat. Oh, shit.
5956640	5959200	Yo, it's about time we got a new Manson.
5959500	5964940	Yo, you feel like dancing to the new Manson beat to the beat to the fucking feet.
5965080	5969000	Put your feet down and it's going to be beat, beat up and beat down.
5969040	5972100	Fuck your mama so hard a smile was a frown turned her upside down.
5972100	5974160	Fucked her again. Put my dick inside her mouth.
5974160	5978040	Did it again from nine to 10, 10 p.m. Refractory period.
5978300	5983840	Yo, new Manson, yo, start dance and left foot, right foot, jump in the air.
5983840	5986340	Fucked your mama so hard, gave her long hair.
5986640	5989900	She became a hippie, came to my ranch, said, let's do something trippy.
5989900	5993900	Go up in the hills, kill people with a fork, right pig on the wall.
5994440	5997300	Start a race war. Black people, white people.
5997900	5999400	That was their plan.
5999400	6001300	Does everybody know that was their plan?
6001300	6002400	That was their plan.
6002400	6005700	Charles Manson was a fucking horrible racist.
6005700	6007400	That's the other thing that I learned.
6007500	6009800	That's why I shouldn't be sympathetic to Manson.
6010300	6012100	Charles Manson was a racist guy.
6012100	6016100	He said, here's why we're going to be the only ones left.
6016100	6018000	We're going to start a race war, be the only ones left.
6018000	6021100	We're going to go kill these famous people and write black people.
6021100	6025300	Did it on the wall, basically, and then everyone will kill each other.
6025300	6028300	And then they'll be in a shelter, Helter Skelter.
6028300	6031900	And they'll come out and never felt better.
6032400	6035100	All right. Charles Manson. Yo, don't stop the beat.
6035100	6037300	Stop the beat. Don't stop the beat.
6037300	6039300	New Manson in the street.
6039300	6041900	New Manson's named Dan Harmon going on the ranch.
6041900	6044900	He's causing no harm and just inspiring people to live.
6044900	6048400	But what's the shit you give going to put me in a cell next?
6049760	6052900	Just because I sucked your mama's neck, gave her a hickey.
6053960	6055000	Denver slipped her a mickey.
6055000	6057900	It was always consensual on the dance floor.
6059000	6061000	Me and your mama go back a long way.
6061000	6062400	Fucked her mama so hard.
6062500	6065100	She's Doris Day and I'm Gene Kelly.
6065100	6067100	Fucked your mama until my dick got smelly.
6067100	6068100	Ugh, gross.
6068100	6070000	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
6070000	6073800	So disgusting. Bad rap is no, no good.
6077600	6081000	A PSA. Bad rap is no good.
6081600	6083300	Metal isn't wood.
6083300	6085700	You can't make a flute from a sewer cap.
6086600	6088800	Rap, rapity rap.
6088800	6090900	I'm going to rap about this and rap about that.
6090900	6093400	Put my left foot forward and my right foot back.
6093400	6095100	Oh shit, Manson's back.
6095100	6098200	Get on the floor and tell people go out.
6098200	6099400	You don't need a steeple.
6099400	6103000	Take your shit into the hills and fucking do some kills
6103000	6105000	and write helter skelter on the wall.
6105000	6106900	And then we'll get a race war from it all.
6106900	6109100	Then we'll dig a bunker in the ground.
6109100	6111600	And here's what we will have found that the black people
6111600	6112900	killed all the white people.
6112900	6115900	And then we'll have bottle caps for money and we'll be happy.
6115900	6117300	I'm not sure what the plan was.
6118300	6120800	Okay, here's the deal.
6120800	6123800	I fucked your mama's heel.
6123800	6126300	Rub my dick on the joint.
6128300	6130300	Gave myself a point.
6130300	6131800	Made a game of it.
6131800	6132800	A parlor game.
6132800	6133800	Fucked your mama.
6133800	6137300	Fucking's the same but the point's giving me an incentive.
6137300	6139300	When I fuck I get inventive.
6139300	6140800	Fucked your mama so hard she came.
6140800	6142800	Fucked your mama, did it again.
6142800	6146800	Went to Detroit.
6147800	6150300	Fucked your mama in Beloit.
6150300	6152300	That's the place in Wisconsin.
6152300	6155300	Your mama is, it's constant.
6155300	6156300	My cum.
6156300	6157300	Alright.
6157300	6158300	No more fucking mamas.
6158300	6159300	It's the wrong time.
6159300	6163300	It's not the right place to be disrespecting women all over the place.
6163300	6166300	Rhyme plays the place and then you get a rhyme coming on her face.
6166300	6168300	Women are human beings.
6168300	6170300	They're equals and they have feelings.
6170300	6172300	And we should respect them as partners.
6172300	6176300	But I fucked your mama really harder than I've ever fucked your dad.
6176300	6178800	And when I fuck men, I'm not half bad.
6178800	6180800	I'm bisexual, bi-curious.
6180800	6184800	I'm gonna fuck you so hard that you wonder what it is that I did with you last night.
6184800	6188800	And then you'll go to work and you'll start to feel tight in your neck and your spine and part of your calf.
6188800	6191800	And then you'll go to the doctor and they'll say, what have you done?
6191800	6194800	And you'll say, son, went out with Dan Harmon and the fun begun.
6194800	6196800	And he'll say, don't go out with him.
6196800	6197800	He's fucked up.
6197800	6202800	He goes to the gym with Rob Hubel when he works out and fucked his mama until she got the gout.
6202800	6207300	Your legs got kind of cramped on the ramp.
6207300	6211300	On the treadmill, Rob Hubel gonna do it in the bubble.
6211300	6213300	Rob Hubel's mom's here to stay.
6213300	6215300	Rob Hubel, work out today.
6215300	6217300	Rob Hubel, work out rap.
6217300	6219300	Rob Hubel, don't take that.
6219300	6221300	Rob Hubel, work them bones.
6221300	6223300	Rob Hubel, don't go home.
6223300	6225300	Rob Hubel gonna get fit.
6225300	6227300	Rob Hubel's mom's got tits.
6227300	6229300	I squeeze them and I fuck them.
6229300	6231300	I lick her titties and suck them.
6231300	6233300	I made his mom pregnant.
6233300	6235300	Rob Hubel is my son.
6235300	6237300	Rob Hubel's my son.
6237300	6239300	That's where the story begun.
6239300	6243300	I held Rob Hubel up and said, be like your dad, seven up,
6243300	6246300	scintillating, effervescent,
6246300	6248300	ever elevating.
6248300	6252300	Bring my dick up to floor three.
6252300	6254300	Take a pee.
6254300	6260300	There's a vast difference between you and me in the elevator of my dick, you see.
6260300	6262300	Vastiferous.
6266300	6268300	Seminal vesicles.
6269300	6271300	Tube leading from metastacles.
6273300	6275300	Seminiferous tubules.
6277300	6279300	U-tube with the jewels.
6280300	6284300	U-tube, U-tube, seminiferous, U-tube-ules.
6286300	6288300	Yo.
6288300	6290300	New Manson.
6290300	6292300	I'm dancing.
6292300	6294300	Hoppin' down.
6294300	6295300	Make a frown.
6295300	6297300	New Manson.
6298300	6299300	New Manson.
6299300	6301300	New Manson just got born.
6301300	6303300	On Sunday morning.
6303300	6305300	Got all shaven and shorn.
6305300	6307300	Eat some corn.
6307300	6308300	Mash it up.
6308300	6309300	Make it soup.
6309300	6310300	Pee it out.
6310300	6311300	Eat it with poop.
6311300	6313300	Put it on a plate with a fork.
6313300	6316300	Fuck your mama like my name was Mark Mindy.
6317300	6319300	In the place to be.
6319300	6323300	Pam Dauber doesn't need more grief.
6323300	6325300	Leave her out of it.
6328300	6329300	New Manson.
6331300	6334300	New Manson, Charles' name, inspiring's my game.
6334300	6341300	Gonna talk to people, tell them what to do, take out the forks, kill them through, stab pregnant women.
6342300	6346300	Then go swimming in their blood.
6346300	6349300	Roman Polanski got so fucked up that he fucked a child.
6349300	6350300	That's what's up.
6351300	6353300	It's Charles Manson's fault.
6353300	6356300	His hands were tied on that one apparently.
6356300	6358300	That's what they say.
6359300	6363300	If it hadn't been for Manson, he would have been a proud father.
6364300	6366300	Roman Polanski.
6367300	6371300	It's kinda weird when you see his recent movies with Johnny Depp.
6372300	6374300	They're not that good.
6377300	6378300	Forgive me.
6379300	6381300	AFI Top 100.
6381300	6383300	Fuck your mama so hard.
6385300	6386300	Charles Manson.
6390300	6391300	Yeah.
6393300	6394300	Manson.
6397300	6398300	Sock threads.
6398300	6399300	Sock threads.
6399300	6400300	Make a spider.
6401300	6402300	Fuck your mama on a Ryder truck.
6402300	6404300	U-Haul, don't matter which one.
6404300	6406300	Took it across the country to have some fun.
6406300	6408300	Moved from New York to L.A.
6408300	6410300	Started this killing spree today.
6410300	6412300	Started a cult on a Manson ranch.
6412300	6416300	Said, go out there like your name was Blanche on Golden Girls.
6416300	6418300	Take this fork for a world.
6418300	6419300	Go stab some people with it.
6419300	6421300	Alright, we're talking in circles.
6422300	6423300	Massacres.
6423300	6424300	Blood.
6424300	6425300	Virginia Tech.
6427300	6428300	Families.
6430300	6431300	Word.
6432300	6433300	Johannesburg.
6436300	6437300	Alright.
6437300	6438300	Stop.
6440300	6441300	New Manson.
6441300	6442300	Man, they could have.
6442300	6443300	New Manson.
6443300	6446300	It's not your guys' job to put me out of my misery, but yeah.
6446300	6447300	No.
6447300	6448300	Well done, sir.
6448300	6449300	New Manson.
6449300	6450300	There were some catchy parts.
6450300	6452300	There were some catchy parts.
6453300	6458300	You have done stuff for HBO, and you've done stuff for Adult Swim, that you've been a producer.
6458300	6462300	Is that something that you are the best at bringing it back to me?
6462300	6466300	I don't want to ruin it by saying it, but this is the perfect fucking show format.
6466300	6467300	That's my dream.
6470300	6472300	You like producing.
6472300	6476300	Do you lean towards producing more than performing?
6476300	6479300	I don't love doing that.
6479300	6480300	Because it's harder.
6481300	6483300	I tell you what I like.
6483300	6484300	I like it.
6484300	6486300	I'm as lazy as the next person.
6486300	6494300	I like it when you can show up, and they wrote a really funny script, and you do that script,
6494300	6499300	and if there's time, they're like, and improvise, and also make it if you want to throw in your
6499300	6500300	own jokes.
6500300	6501300	I love that.
6501300	6504300	But more and more, that doesn't happen.
6504300	6508300	So I feel like I write stuff out of necessity for myself.
6508300	6510300	And that's not a sustainable life, right?
6510300	6511300	Like an actor's life.
6511300	6513300	I don't think that it is.
6513300	6514300	You get really caught off guard.
6514300	6523300	It's like next to NFL player in how well you're treated for a very short time, and then you
6523300	6524300	can be...
6524300	6526300	And then your phone does not ring.
6526300	6527300	Yeah.
6527300	6530300	I just didn't ever want to be one of...
6530300	6535300	You want to be able to control things as much as you can.
6535300	6538300	And I'm not a good writer.
6538300	6544300	I don't think I'm a good writer, but it's fucking really hard.
6544300	6546300	I have a hard time writing.
6546300	6549300	You probably just fucking pound it out, and it's genius.
6549300	6552300	But I fucking sit there and just sweat it out.
6552300	6553300	It's so hard.
6553300	6554300	But I just...
6554300	6556300	Is that the hardest part?
6556300	6557300	What's that?
6557300	6558300	Is that the hardest part?
6558300	6559300	Or is the writing?
6559300	6560300	Or is it harder to manage?
6560300	6561300	Because you work with crews.
6561300	6562300	Yeah.
6562300	6565300	The managing of the thing, I've had help with...
6565300	6570300	For Dead Body and stuff, I did that with the guys from Children's Hospital with Abominable,
6570300	6572300	and so they helped with all that in Funny or Die.
6572300	6574300	So I've had a lot of support with...
6574300	6578300	I don't know how to fucking hire crews and do a budget for a show.
6578300	6581300	I sort of hire someone to do that for me.
6581300	6584300	But the actual...
6584300	6589300	So I try to focus on the writing and then getting the right mix of actors to help us out,
6589300	6591300	other comedy people to help us out.
6591300	6596300	So I like all that, but to your point, I do that out of necessity,
6596300	6603300	because to just be a guy that's popping up every now and then on TV shows and movies,
6603300	6604300	you can't...
6604300	6606300	I don't know how you can do that anymore.
6606300	6608300	I think you have to have...
6608300	6610300	I would just have to fucking panic the whole time.
6610300	6612300	Yeah, you have to be creating stuff.
6612300	6613300	You have to...
6613300	6616300	Because even if you're successful, I think that the psychological
6616300	6619300	of not controlling your own destiny is still a mind fuck.
6619300	6624300	Which makes me admire actors, because to be able to suppress that anxiety
6624300	6626300	and not succumb to that...
6626300	6628300	Completely insane, yeah.
6628300	6633300	But I do get very jealous of people that just fucking show...
6633300	6638300	They're just like, oh, and then I was on this show and then I did this huge movie
6638300	6641300	and now I'm fucking set.
6641300	6648300	I just haven't had that, but more power to you if that's your...
6648300	6649300	If you can be a guy for hire.
6649300	6650300	If that happens to you.
6650300	6651300	Yeah.
6651300	6652300	What is the goal?
6652300	6653300	The goal...
6653300	6656300	Because I've been a fool, I think.
6656300	6657300	Or have I?
6657300	6658300	Maybe I'm nailing it.
6658300	6661300	I don't know, because I just feel like I've spent so long in such a panic
6661300	6664300	and I've backed into...
6664300	6669300	Well, it's like there's this fundamental layer of like,
6669300	6671300	well, you've got to not be homeless.
6671300	6674300	You've got to not end up fucked up.
6674300	6679300	You've got to end up not stupid that you didn't see this trend
6679300	6683300	or that trend coming or that you didn't see your own obsolescence.
6683300	6685300	You didn't...
6685300	6689300	I just have this very Wisconsin like, just terror in me
6689300	6691300	that I don't even think about.
6691300	6692300	It's just there.
6692300	6694300	It's just the foundation of my life.
6694300	6696300	It's like, you've got to retire.
6696300	6698300	Which is so funny, because it's like...
6698300	6700300	Yeah, I have no desire to retire.
6700300	6701300	I do.
6701300	6702300	What would you do?
6702300	6704300	I would fucking...
6704300	6709300	Not knowing the answer to that question is called freedom.
6709300	6716300	All you have to do is find a million dollars under a rock
6716300	6718300	and then, yeah, I do Rick and Morty.
6718300	6720300	I do stuff for fun.
6723300	6724300	Oh, no.
6724300	6725300	Go back.
6725300	6726300	Go back.
6726300	6729300	Well, I was just thinking about the fact that I'm just so wrong
6729300	6731300	about everything because I always...
6731300	6735300	I do all this shit, you know, and it probably like...
6735300	6740300	It's like Rick and Morty comes from such joy so easy.
6740300	6742300	It's like Adult Swim said, do something.
6742300	6744300	And I said, well, I don't want to do something bad.
6744300	6745300	So I called Justin.
6745300	6750300	And I'm like, just yes and Justin into this thing
6750300	6753300	that makes so many people happy that then also now is the thing
6753300	6755300	that I'm going to end up...
6755300	6758300	That is going to represent the biggest paycheck I've ever gotten
6758300	6760300	out of all the shit that I've ever done.
6760300	6763300	And it's also the thing that was just fun.
6763300	6766300	So what is all this other Daffy Duck shit that I'm always pulling
6766300	6770300	where I'm like, well, you know, I think that fiber optic is the future.
6770300	6772300	So I want to get in a room with Taco Bell
6772300	6776300	and talk to them about a sketch show made of ground beef
6776300	6779300	where you can vote for each crouton.
6779300	6784300	And I call it the Harmon Taco Deluxe package.
6784300	6788300	Like I'm trying to be a producer because I'm in a panic, you know?
6788300	6790300	Yeah, I don't know the answer.
6790300	6795300	I guess it just depends on how you value your time
6795300	6797300	and how you value your sanity
6797300	6800300	and if money is the most important thing
6800300	6805300	or if it's just like, oh, I want to make something that I really like.
6805300	6807300	And, you know, I don't know.
6807300	6809300	I don't know. It's different for everybody, I guess.
6809300	6812300	Except for the hustle. The hustle is the same for all.
6813300	6815300	Whether it comes from wanting to retire early
6815300	6817300	or whether it comes from having to put food on the table
6817300	6820300	or whether it comes from wherever, it does not change.
6820300	6821300	Well, that's what's funny.
6821300	6822300	But you've been great at it.
6822300	6827300	Well, I don't know about great, but I just try to fucking keep doing shit.
6827300	6828300	But thank you for saying that.
6828300	6830300	But that's what's funny to me is like people online or whatever,
6830300	6833300	like on Twitter or whatever, just like,
6833300	6835300	when people say like, why the fuck would you do that?
6835300	6837300	And they'll see you in something that's shitty.
6837300	6839300	And like, oh, why would you do that?
6839300	6842300	It's like, well, one, you just try a lot of shit.
6842300	6844300	Some of it is good. Some of it is not good.
6844300	6846300	You saw something that wasn't that good.
6846300	6848300	I'm doing other shit, too, you know?
6848300	6851300	But I agree with you. That thing was not that good.
6851300	6852300	You know, whatever.
6852300	6854300	Why were you in Garfield 7?
6854300	6856300	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6856300	6858300	And then, yeah, but then there's stuff like that.
6858300	6860300	Like, I would be in Garfield 7 in a heartbeat.
6860300	6863300	Well, because the stakes are pretty low that you shouldn't care.
6863300	6865300	Why are you watching Garfield 7, motherfucker?
6865300	6867300	Exactly. That's what I say.
6867300	6869300	Motherfucker, are you watching Garfield 7?
6869300	6871300	Why did you see me at that party?
6871300	6873300	Yeah.
6873300	6875300	Yeah, I would love to be in Garfield 7.
6875300	6877300	I feel like that stigma has gone away,
6877300	6879300	which is a good thing probably,
6879300	6882300	but it's gone away because like,
6882300	6886300	that Hollywood like,
6886300	6888300	edifice has been cracked.
6888300	6892300	Like, people look at what we do as honest labor now,
6892300	6893300	a little bit.
6893300	6895300	They look at it as very, very privileged,
6895300	6900300	like, we're lucky because I haven't lifted a box in years.
6900300	6901300	Yeah.
6901300	6903300	And I have a five bedroom house,
6903300	6905300	and I don't have five children.
6905300	6908300	I have two dogs and some Slim Jims.
6908300	6913300	And it's like, so it's a mansion relative to what I've done
6913300	6914300	and who I am.
6914300	6917300	And it's a fucking wonderful life.
6917300	6920300	And so it's, but I do at the same time think that
6920300	6922300	on an unconscious level,
6922300	6924300	people don't think about it anymore the way they used to.
6924300	6928300	I remember when David Cross was in Small Soldiers 2 or something
6928300	6930300	and I was like, what, David?
6930300	6931300	Yeah.
6931300	6934300	Because I was fresh off the boat from Milwaukee and was like,
6934300	6937300	oh, yeah, it's just everything was a choice
6937300	6939300	and everything mattered.
6939300	6941300	And like, I don't think any, I can't imagine anybody's like,
6941300	6944300	Aubrey Plaza, why'd you do Grumpy Cat?
6944300	6948300	Like, I think the answer to everything now is because
6948300	6950300	it's a joke, because life's a joke,
6951300	6954300	because working is important.
6954300	6956300	And also sometimes it's like, it was December
6956300	6958300	and there was nothing else going on.
6958300	6960300	I wanted to go to fucking, you know,
6960300	6962300	they were shooting it in Australia,
6962300	6964300	and I thought that'd be a fun place to go.
6964300	6965300	But that old world.
6965300	6967300	I was in the middle of depression and they called,
6967300	6968300	so I had to get off the couch.
6968300	6970300	Yeah, or I just broke up with my boyfriend
6970300	6971300	and I wanted to get away from him.
6971300	6972300	So I went to, yeah.
6972300	6977300	Me wondering why David Cross is in Small Soldiers 2
6977300	6981300	comes from this weird old world supposition
6981300	6984300	that the goal is to become Cary Grant or something,
6984300	6985300	that there's going to be like,
6985300	6987300	you're going to be in Lawrence of Arabia
6987300	6988300	if you play your cards right
6988300	6989300	or you're going to be Bill Murray.
6989300	6992300	And like, I just don't, we don't, we see-
6992300	6993300	That doesn't exist anymore.
6993300	6994300	I don't, yeah, it's hard to tell though
6994300	6995300	because it's a moving target
6995300	6998300	because like my world has become completely different.
6998300	7000300	So I don't know if when I, like,
7000300	7002300	I don't know if the world has changed or I've changed,
7002300	7005300	but when I see a poster on a bus stop
7005300	7007300	and like Paul F. Tompkins is looking out
7007300	7009300	from behind a genie bottle or whatever,
7009300	7011300	I'm making that up, that's not real.
7011300	7013300	But if I saw that, I would be like,
7013300	7016300	I'd toot my horn and go like, fuck, yes, Paul F.
7016300	7019300	Get it, get that paycheck.
7019300	7027300	But maybe that's a total distortion of working out here.
7027300	7029300	Yeah, I don't know that those,
7029300	7031300	that that status exists anymore of like,
7031300	7034300	oh, then you just like the Cary Grant analogy
7034300	7036300	is like a good one.
7036300	7038300	But yeah, I don't, I don't think that exists.
7038300	7040300	I don't think you ever graduate to this stratosphere
7040300	7043300	where then you just fucking like coast, you know,
7043300	7046300	and you're just in the fucking huge, awesome projects.
7046300	7049300	I mean, maybe like, I feel like Chris Pratt has done that,
7049300	7051300	you know, like in a cool way,
7051300	7057300	like he's in huge, cool movies and, you know,
7057300	7060300	but even Middleditch is doing phone ads.
7060300	7063300	And usually you didn't do those at the same time.
7063300	7065300	You do a series, get off the series,
7065300	7066300	and you'd be like, you guys miss me?
7066300	7068300	I'm repping a product.
7068300	7070300	But when I see Middleditch as a phone ad,
7070300	7072300	my first thought is cha-ching.
7072300	7073300	Yeah, absolutely.
7073300	7074300	So happy.
7074300	7075300	I think all that has changed.
7075300	7077300	I think the commercial thing has changed.
7077300	7079300	I think like now, yeah, there's no shame in that.
7079300	7081300	Like I feel like that's just fucking.
7081300	7082300	And it's simultaneous.
7082300	7085300	You're on a TV show and you've got great commercials.
7086300	7090300	And I would feel the same way, but an NFL player,
7090300	7092300	like I'm not a fan of sports,
7092300	7096300	but every time I see an athlete in a sock commercial
7096300	7099300	or something, I'm like, oh, good, save your money.
7099300	7101300	Like don't, like you're a gladiator
7101300	7103300	and they're going to murder you and hang you up to dry.
7103300	7105300	I'm like, it's so great for you and your family
7105300	7108300	that you got to like advertise beef steak or something.
7108300	7111300	Like if you make it through that thing,
7111300	7113300	like just put that money in a coffee can
7113300	7115300	and fucking guard it with a shotgun,
7115300	7118300	like buy a house in the worst part of the country
7118300	7120300	and so that it stays there forever.
7120300	7121300	Stay form.
7121300	7123300	It's the greatest assurance that'll play.
7123300	7125300	Stay form.
7125300	7129300	My name is Jumping Jack Lightning.
7129300	7132300	You probably ask yourself, why might I hop?
7132300	7136300	Is there any commercial, not that you were doing him,
7136300	7139300	but is there any commercial that Shaq will not do?
7139300	7140300	Shaq pain.
7140300	7142300	Like bad pills.
7142300	7143300	Shaq.
7143300	7144300	Taco Bell.
7144300	7145300	Pepsi.
7145300	7147300	Domes back peel.
7147300	7149300	Depends underwear.
7149300	7152300	Air.
7152300	7154300	Welcome to China.
7154300	7159300	I was at the Turner up front and who was the combination
7159300	7164300	of like Conan and I think Charles Barkley
7164300	7169300	and Anderson Cooper, like really funny.
7169300	7171300	But I was like, I was like Charles Barkley's like
7171300	7172300	really funny.
7172300	7173300	He's like, really?
7173300	7175300	Is he known as among that?
7175300	7176300	I don't know him.
7176300	7177300	He's hilarious.
7177300	7180300	But I mean, do people do people like is his reputation,
7180300	7183300	is he like the Jenny McCarthy of basketball players
7183300	7186300	in that it's like, oh, look, he can like make faces too.
7186300	7191300	It's like he's the David Lee Roth of basketball players.
7191300	7194300	You're like, man, fuck this.
7194300	7195300	Funny.
7195300	7197300	Fuck this dude.
7197300	7200300	But he does have he's got bits.
7200300	7202300	He's the comic relief.
7202300	7206300	But that that Shaquille O'Neal ways voice.
7206300	7207300	Careful.
7207300	7211300	There's an obstruction coming up.
7211300	7214300	Don't have a Shaxxident.
7214300	7216300	Amazing.
7216300	7217300	We love that.
7217300	7218300	I like right.
7218300	7221300	Yeah, like there's a there's tarot cards we have
7221300	7222300	for different people.
7222300	7223300	Like we need an Athena.
7223300	7225300	We need an Aphrodite.
7225300	7226300	We need a Zeus.
7226300	7227300	We need a Hermes.
7228300	7235300	We like like Arnold Schwarzenegger occupied this like
7235300	7240300	for like so long it was just like his catch phrases
7240300	7243300	were parodies of catch phrases which were parodies of catch
7243300	7248300	as it's like he like like like you always want that like big dumb
7248300	7251300	brute like like like somebody that kind of sounds like they're
7251300	7256300	an oaf and that they just like say stuff like Shaxxident.
7257300	7260300	I'm not I'm sorry Shaquille O'Neal if I called you an oaf.
7260300	7263300	I don't I don't know if you have a boy.
7263300	7265300	You're a giant like me.
7265300	7268300	You sound slow because your heart is probably beating
7268300	7271300	like a whale's like like I guess probably it's probably
7271300	7273300	like when you when you listen to the whale beats
7273300	7276300	and it's like boom boom because it's like a bucket of blood
7276300	7279300	has to go up nine feet.
7279300	7281300	You are never going to be on his podcast.
7281300	7285300	There's no way I'm digging myself out of this nine foot
7285300	7288300	three hundred pound hole making fun of Shaquille O'Neal.
7288300	7290300	I didn't mean to call him slow.
7290300	7293300	I feel like I should just leave you here to wallow in this hole
7293300	7294300	but we have to wrap it up.
7294300	7295300	You can help me.
7295300	7296300	Brandon.
7296300	7297300	No.
7297300	7298300	No.
7298300	7299300	Talk to Tiny Brandon for me.
7299300	7301300	Tell him help me with Shaq.
7302300	7304300	Tiny Brandon is pissed off too.
7304300	7305300	Tiny Brandon is fucked.
7305300	7306300	I am fucked.
7306300	7309300	I have no support system in the African-American community.
7312300	7314300	Let's let's take him home with something sweet.
7314300	7316300	Did we talk through a whole podcast?
7316300	7317300	Did we do it?
7317300	7318300	We actually pulled it off.
7318300	7319300	Thank you so much, Rob Huebel.
7319300	7323300	Dude, thanks for letting me come out here and I got to say,
7323300	7325300	man, a new Manson.
7328300	7330300	I hope that catches fire.
7330300	7331300	Yeah.
7331300	7336300	I just got a text from Ryan Seacrest once we clear it.
7336300	7339300	Ryan Seacrest, are you hanging out with him right now?
7339300	7340300	We're the same height.
7340300	7342300	It seems like he has more shit to deal with right now
7342300	7344300	than texting you.
7344300	7347300	No, it's pretty much 16 hours a day.
7347300	7348300	And then he goes back to work.
7348300	7349300	He's always texting you.
7349300	7352300	Does anyone ever connect with dots between Seacrest and
7352300	7354300	Watercrest?
7354300	7356300	There's probably nothing to do there, right?
7356300	7358300	Seacrest, like...
7358300	7360300	It feels like a rap song about to happen.
7360300	7361300	Yeah.
7361300	7362300	All right.
7362300	7363300	Well, thanks for...
7363300	7364300	And even Huebel might have to jump in on this one
7364300	7365300	for just a couple bars.
7365300	7366300	Oh, shit.
7366300	7367300	Yeah, I think I'll have to throw it to both of you.
7367300	7369300	I'll fuck it up.
7369300	7370300	Oh, shit.
7370300	7371300	Yo.
7371300	7372300	Okay.
7372300	7374300	Right about now.
7374300	7376300	It's time to rap.
7376300	7378300	Rapping.
7378300	7381300	It's not about just clapping.
7381300	7383300	It's not about fur trapping.
7383300	7386300	It's not turn of the century.
7386300	7389300	Inter-overlapping.
7389300	7392300	We're just waiting for that beat to drop a little.
7392300	7394300	Colonial nightmare.
7394300	7396300	Sea to sea.
7396300	7397300	Shining coast to coast.
7397300	7399300	Look at me.
7399300	7401300	Plymouth Rock done landed on me
7401300	7403300	because I ain't doing nothing but slinging rock.
7403300	7407300	You see, from Staten Island to the coast of Maine
7407300	7410300	and to the Bahamas is my game.
7410300	7411300	I got every borough.
7411300	7413300	I can name them by name.
7413300	7416300	I got Queens, Brooklyn, Bahamas, and Maine.
7416300	7417300	Yo.
7417300	7419300	I knew all of New York.
7419300	7422300	I could count the times like my fingers were a fork.
7422300	7425300	My name's Poseidon and I live under the water.
7425300	7428300	I'm fucking bombers and I'm also fucking daughters
7428300	7431300	because everyone is a fish to me
7431300	7434300	and I can talk to fish as well as you can see
7434300	7437300	and you can see in the dark but you cannot see me
7437300	7440300	because I'm the monster that's coming after thee.
7440300	7443300	I talk biblical when I'm stretching for a rhyme.
7443300	7446300	I talk biblical when the forks need a time.
7446300	7449300	I talk biblical when I'm rhyming another time.
7449300	7453300	I'm Poseidon and I talk biblical to dodge shit.
7453300	7454300	Yo.
7454300	7457300	I fucked your mama so hard.
7457300	7459300	I fucked your mama so hard.
7459300	7461300	I fucked your mama for a hundred yards,
7461300	7464300	throwing it to MC Hubel.
7464300	7465300	Now.
7465300	7468300	Tears on the face of Ryan Seacrest.
7468300	7471300	Tears on the face of Ryan Seacrest.
7471300	7474300	He thought he was the best but he is a monster.
7474300	7477300	Seacrest, you know you did it.
7480300	7483300	Like an alcoholic sponsor.
7483300	7486300	You was a monster back to Hubel.
7486300	7487300	Check out the beats.
7487300	7490300	Rhymes ain't futile.
7492300	7493300	Yo.
7493300	7494300	Yo.
7494300	7495300	Stalling.
7495300	7496300	Stalling for the beat.
7496300	7499300	Waiting for it to drop.
7499300	7500300	Yes.
7501300	7502300	Right about now.
7502300	7503300	Tricky beat.
7503300	7504300	Stalling for beats.
7504300	7505300	Stalling for rhymes.
7505300	7506300	Stalling for time.
7506300	7507300	Stalling for feet.
7507300	7508300	Stalling all the time.
7508300	7510300	Stalling for crime.
7510300	7513300	Stalling all across this country line.
7513300	7514300	New Manson.
7514300	7515300	Favorite song.
7515300	7518300	New Manson is my favorite song.
7518300	7522300	Except for the part about murdering pregnant women.
7522300	7523300	Not cool with that.
7523300	7525300	Not cool with that.
7532300	7534300	Super stony beat.
7534300	7535300	Super stony.
7535300	7537300	On my feet.
7537300	7543300	Beat is what you like to smoke when you have got to fight a bully
7543300	7545300	at your school or house.
7545300	7547300	Smoke that weed.
7547300	7550300	Then go downtown and get some Seacrest.
7550300	7552300	A sandwich for him to eat.
7552300	7557300	And then I drive the beat back to your house where Seacrest lives.
7557300	7560300	He lives in the mouse with his friends.
7562300	7566300	Oh, now Brandon's gonna take it like milk from a cow.
7566300	7569300	He's gonna squeeze the udders and make you all shudder.
7569300	7572300	Brandon Johnson in the house now.
7572300	7575300	I might not take this shit like milk.
7575300	7578300	But I come dressed oh so silk.
7578300	7579300	Clean as fuck.
7579300	7581300	Oh my God so sharp.

7620300	7623300	I can't believe you get to say the n-word.
7623300	7626300	I can't believe you get to say the n-word.
7626300	7629300	I'm gonna use that as an excuse.
7629300	7632300	Why my rhymes are weaker than yours.
7632300	7634300	You can say niggling.
7634300	7635300	No.
7635300	7636300	Nope.
7636300	7637300	Nope.
7637300	7638300	That's just being lacy niggling.
7638300	7639300	Nope.
7639300	7640300	Nope.
7640300	7641300	Nope.
7641300	7642300	Alright well.
7642300	7644300	Keep your mama giggling.
7644300	7647300	Right about now we're not gonna try to follow that.
7647300	7651300	We're gonna leave this world like a cat of a hat.
7651300	7653300	Since how weak we've gotten.
7653300	7657300	Brandon Johnson's rhymes leave us besotten.
7657300	7659300	That's not a word.
7659300	7661300	It's been a good show.
7661300	7662300	It hasn't been a turd.
7662300	7665300	If it did seem like a turd.
7665300	7667300	It had some healthy peanuts in it.
7667300	7668300	And those were our words.
7668300	7670300	We spoke from the heart.
7670300	7671300	We spoke from the head.
7671300	7674300	I fucked your mama until kick turned to bread.
7674300	7676300	Reverse Midas.
7676300	7678300	I make shit less valuable.
7678300	7684300	New Manson.
7684300	7685300	Yo.
7685300	7687300	New Manson had its moments.
7687300	7688300	Yo.
7688300	7690300	Zack McKeever was on beats.
7690300	7693300	He also does all the audio treats.
7693300	7694300	But not just treats.
7694300	7696300	He does all the foundations.
7696300	7704300	Everything you hear is due to Zack McKeever's nation.
7704300	7707300	Chris Baruff is the man that directs the show.
7707300	7710300	He looks through his eyes and so you go.
7710300	7713300	If you are immersed it's due to his talent.
7713300	7715300	Yo.
7715300	7718300	Allen.
7718300	7722300	Havi.

7729300	7730300	Go up the hill.
7730300	7732300	Come down again.
7733300	7735300	She's not just Chris Baruff's girlfriend.
7735300	7738300	That's not fair to her.
7738300	7740300	She does a lot of work.
7740300	7742300	She keeps the show together.
7742300	7744300	She comes up with the titles.
7744300	7746300	She gives them to me on a list.
7746300	7748300	And that makes me entitled to pick one of them.
7748300	7750300	And then I say I choose that one.
7750300	7752300	And then she also.
7752300	7753300	Okay.
7753300	7754300	All right.
7754300	7755300	We ran out of beat.
