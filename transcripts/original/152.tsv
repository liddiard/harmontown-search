0	14000	From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, Hermitown is now in session.
14000	25000	Please keep those applause going for your Dungeon Master, Mr. Spencer Crittenton.
25000	28000	See him scurry to his table.
28000	30000	That was good scurrying.
30000	33000	That was almost a scamper.
33000	35000	How you doing, Spencer?
35000	37000	I'm good.
37000	39000	Are you ready to bring out the mayor, Spencer?
39000	40000	Yeah.
40000	41000	Let's say it together.
41000	44000	Sam Harvey!
53000	54000	Dang it.
59000	61000	Why do I come in from the back?
61000	63000	At this point, it's kind of really dumb.
63000	65000	There's a tripod in my way.
65000	71000	If we're going to do that, we need a jib camera that attracts you if you come in or a steadicam.
71000	73000	We're tweaking the format here.
73000	77000	Let's bring Spencer up at the top of the show instead of saving him for dessert.
77000	79000	I really mangled this guy's leg, too.
79000	80000	Oh, really?
80000	82000	Why don't you step by this guy?
82000	84000	Step all over it.
84000	85000	Oh, wait.
85000	86000	Oh, this guy?
86000	87000	I'm glad I could help.
87000	88000	I thought it was Anatoly.
88000	90000	I was going to say, he deserves it.
90000	96000	Because Anatoly, his feet touch the back wall.
96000	101000	He sits in the front row, and he puts his big Russian legs across the stage.
101000	105000	I would make a joke about Russian history, but they've always been invaded.
105000	108000	It's like the stage was the Ukraine.
110000	113000	And this back wall was the Black Sea.
114000	117000	See, that's the joke I would have made.
118000	120000	I just kept thinking about Napoleon.
120000	123000	I'm like, well, this is not going to work.
123000	127000	Anyways, you remember Napoleon right Anatoly?
129000	132000	Is that a sore subject for Russians, the Napoleonic Wars?
132000	134000	Sure it is.
134000	136000	You beat him.
136000	137000	You kicked his butt.
137000	140000	You sent him packing back home to France.
140000	142000	Let me see if this is working.
142000	143000	Okay, all right.
143000	144000	Great.
144000	145000	This is working.
145000	147000	Okay, so my Twitter notifications are on.
147000	149000	I kind of panicked last time.
149000	150000	They're on.
150000	154000	But if you'd like to tweet at me, I won't yell at you.
154000	162000	It should tap my wrist just a little bit, and I can look, and I can go, oh, good question.
162000	165000	Alison Brie is very nice.
167000	168000	Something like that.
168000	170000	So try not to abuse your power.
170000	171000	Don't be smart, Alex.
171000	174000	Actually, you and the audience, please, just be in the room with us, will you?
174000	176000	Don't sit there and tweet at me.
177000	180000	I'm talking to the people at home on the laptops.
187000	188000	Is it happening?
188000	189000	Has it already happened?
189000	191000	Well, just give me one second.
192000	193000	Can we have it make a little noise?
193000	194000	There's two notifications.
194000	195000	Hi, Dan.
195000	196000	Sorry to be annoying.
196000	199000	What will you be doing while Aaron is in Ireland?
200000	202000	I'll be playing Witcher 3.
205000	206000	Is she in Ireland right now?
206000	207000	No.
207000	208000	She's in St. Louis.
209000	211000	Looking sexy tonight.
211000	213000	Hashtag in the room.
213000	214000	Okay.
219000	220000	That was Spencer.
220000	221000	That was totally Spencer.
221000	222000	Oh, yeah.
222000	223000	It's a dude.
223000	224000	It's Huey.
224000	225000	All right, well, okay.
225000	226000	Huey.
227000	230000	Sports corner, R-E, U.S. Open.
231000	232000	U.S. Open?
232000	234000	A sports corner about the U.S. Open.
234000	235000	Okay.
235000	236000	Shall we?
236000	237000	Okay.
237000	238000	All right.
238000	239000	Sports corner.
241000	244000	We need sports corner music.
244000	245000	Hold up.
245000	246000	Hold up.
246000	248000	Also, women's soccer, right?
248000	249000	Women's World Cup.
250000	251000	Here we are.
254000	255000	Sports corner.
255000	256000	Got to hit the ball.
256000	258000	Got to make it go far in the season.
258000	259000	Fall.
259000	261000	Go in the summer and spring.
261000	262000	Got to do sports.
262000	263000	Got to do your thing.
263000	264000	I like to jump real high.
264000	265000	I like to go real low.
265000	266000	I like to go across the ice.
266000	268000	I like to go across the snow.
268000	269000	Winter.
269000	272000	Olympics are done, but sports corners still kind of fun.
272000	273000	Oh.
274000	275000	Thank you.
276000	277000	Thanks, guys.
277000	278000	Thanks.
280000	281000	I agree.
281000	284000	Now, Dan, sadly, I missed the ending.
285000	288000	Of the U.S. Open, maybe you could tell us what happened.
289000	291000	First of all, maybe you could tell us what sport it is.
292000	299000	Well, I mean, the important thing is that it's American and it is open.
301000	303000	To everyone who plays the sport.
303000	304000	There is no discrimination.
304000	307000	That's the spirit of the U.S. Open.
307000	309000	It's not private.
309000	311000	You can just play.
311000	313000	If you play, you just come and play.
313000	314000	Can women be in it, too?
314000	316000	If it's the women's U.S. Open, yeah.
318000	319000	It's not.
319000	320000	It's not, so no.
324000	327000	But trans men...
327000	333000	What's your favorite thing about the sports that the U.S. Open was celebrating today?
333000	335000	Well, I mean, it's just, as you know...
335000	347000	Like, everything comes down to where that ball is, right?
347000	348000	Absolutely.
349000	351000	So far, you're 100% right.
353000	360000	And it's just like the idea is to get the ball where it needs to be.
360000	363000	Which is where, specifically?
364000	366000	Well, you want to...
366000	369000	What's the destination for this particular ball?
369000	373000	I think the important thing is that you want to do a better job of getting it there than your opponent.
373000	375000	Yes, yes.
378000	379000	So we're done here.
381000	384000	I think it's either tennis or golf.
386000	387000	It's golf.
387000	388000	Okay, it's golf.
388000	389000	I knew that.
389000	390000	Who won the thing?
390000	391000	Did anyone know?
391000	392000	Teddy Ruxpin.
393000	398000	Teddy Ruxpin won the animatronic bear from our childhood?
400000	401000	Teddy Ruxpin won.
401000	403000	That really is open.
403000	404000	Yeah.
404000	405000	See, anyone can do it.
405000	406000	Who won?
406000	407000	Anyone know?
407000	408000	Jordan Spieth.
408000	409000	Jordan Spieth won, all right.
409000	410000	Jordan Spieth?
410000	411000	Spieth.
411000	415000	What'd you think, Dan, about the guy, is it Jason Day, who had vertigo and a couple days
415000	420000	ago absolutely passed out because he has crazy vertigo, went down like on the 16th hole,
420000	423000	managed to pull himself back together, finished the round, and then he almost, he was in the
423000	425000	running the whole way through, wasn't he?
425000	427000	Our fans don't give a shit.
429000	434000	Well, I don't know how many, how much points overcoming vertigo should get you in a sport
434000	438000	where you walk around and hit a ball when you feel like it.
441000	445000	Like, if I was a football player and I suffered from vertigo, my doctor would tell me,
445000	448000	why don't you try golfing?
448000	451000	Go walk around on some grass until you feel better.
451000	456000	So if, while you're doing that, you win a golf tournament, I'm not going to go, plus,
456000	458000	he's so special.
459000	461000	He was here because he can't play football.
461000	464000	How do you feel about the U.S. Women's World Cup right now?
464000	467000	I mean, the Women's World Cup, all inclusive, the whole world.
467000	470000	The Women's World Cup would be soccer.
470000	472000	Football, as we call it.
472000	475000	Those of us who are into soccer, we don't call it soccer.
475000	478000	It's like calling San Francisco Frisco.
478000	480000	I think it's great, Jeff.
480000	482000	Those ladies are out there.
482000	485000	They're doing it just as good as ladies can.
491000	494000	Which might be better than men?
494000	497000	You projected that onto me.
499000	501000	Spencer, are you following the World Cup?
501000	503000	No. Are they playing?
503000	505000	Yes.
505000	508000	The World Cup is playing against FIFA this week, aren't they?
508000	510000	Yeah, it's one of the weirdest matchups.
510000	512000	The World Cup is playing FIFA.
512000	515000	What country is FIFA that's Brazil versus the U.S.?
515000	517000	It's going to be great.
517000	519000	FIFA.
519000	520000	All right.
520000	521000	Double sports corner.
521000	523000	I love the Women's World Cup.
523000	528000	There was a woman playing today, and I'm just adolescent and puerile and stupid enough to have
528000	531000	enjoyed the fact that there was a woman playing for Austria.
531000	533000	His name was Dick and Man.
533000	536000	Dick and Man on the back of everything.
536000	538000	There's also a girl named Tamika Butt.
538000	540000	Yeah.
540000	542000	Butt.
542000	544000	Tamika Butt.
544000	546000	She did a good job.
546000	548000	It's for Tamika Butt.
548000	549000	All right.
549000	551000	Oh, what happened to your glasses, says Annamarie.
551000	553000	You know, I don't know.
553000	557000	I think they left them at the house.
558000	560000	Are you afraid people aren't going to like you right now?
560000	565000	Yeah, well, until Annamarie brought it up, I had forgotten about them.
565000	567000	Tell me you love me.
567000	570000	I love you, Karamie.
570000	571000	Karamie?
571000	576000	Not since Tamika has a name been so chuckly.
576000	577000	Sorry, Karamie.
577000	579000	It's just a weird name.
579000	581000	I give a shit.
581000	583000	Okay.
583000	586000	This is hard because the bird icon keeps coming up.
586000	587000	I give a shit.
587000	588000	It says that guy.
588000	589000	First time live streaming.
589000	590000	Okay.
590000	591000	Good luck.
591000	592000	Kevin...
592000	593000	Okay.
593000	596000	Every time someone sends one, it's not going to work.
596000	599000	Every time someone sends one, a big bird face comes up on the thing.
599000	601000	I'm in the middle of reading one.
601000	602000	It's not working.
602000	603000	See?
603000	604000	See what happens?
604000	607000	You can't disable the bird?
607000	610000	I can't disable the bird.
610000	612000	No, I can't disable the bird.
612000	614000	There should be a bird disable function.
614000	615000	There should be a lot of things.
615000	621000	I found another Apple Watch bug today with my Evernote app.
621000	628000	If you write an Evernote that is exactly as long as the Apple Watch's screen and then
628000	632000	you add more, it won't show it.
632000	635000	But if you add five more things, then it'll show everything.
635000	636000	You can scroll it.
636000	639000	But if you hit it right on the nugget, bug.
639000	641000	That's my bug report.
641000	643000	All right.
643000	644000	Let's beat this shit up.
644000	646000	Let's talk about lesbians and race.
646000	649000	Okay.
649000	651000	I don't really have anything.
651000	652000	Goddamn it.
652000	654000	I can't get to my Evernote.
654000	657000	People keep tweeting.
657000	658000	Okay.
658000	659000	All right.
659000	661000	This is better than the phone?
661000	664000	Shut up, Jeff.
664000	666000	I didn't mean that to be provocative.
666000	669000	It would have been better than the phone if I hadn't tried the Twitter experiment.
669000	672000	I thought we could try the Twitter thing and it would be cool.
672000	673000	We tried something.
673000	674000	And you know what?
674000	677000	Do you know what the Four Agreements guy says?
677000	680000	Did you read more of the book?
680000	681000	No.
681000	683000	This is something I still remember from the first two agreements.
683000	684000	We're only going off.
684000	687000	You're reading a half hour of a two-hour agreement.
687000	690000	I'm one agreement in and that's good enough.
690000	693000	Did you know Jurassic World sucked 25 minutes through?
693000	694000	Yes, you did.
694000	696000	The Four Agreements are pretty good.
696000	699000	I'm one agreement in.
699000	705000	So the guy says animals only pay for a mistake one time in their whole life.
705000	707000	One time for each mistake.
707000	711000	Humans are the only animal that pays a thousand times for each mistake.
711000	714000	That's the stupidest.
714000	717000	Is that because animals die if they make a mistake?
717000	718000	They get eaten?
718000	721000	No, he's not being a Darwinist.
721000	724000	He's saying animals just let it go?
724000	726000	Well, yeah, they let it go.
726000	728000	No, they learn from their mistakes.
728000	729000	Yeah, they learn once.
729000	730000	They learn the first time.
730000	731000	So do we.
731000	735000	But then we pay for the same mistake a thousand times.
735000	736000	Oh, my God, you guys.
736000	738000	It's not that fucking weird.
738000	740000	It's fucking humans have anxiety.
740000	743000	We fucking belabor our mistakes over and over again.
743000	745000	Raccoons don't.
745000	748000	They make a mistake when they're getting your garbage and they're like,
748000	750000	their paw gets hurt on the garbage can.
750000	752000	Then they go like, ow, that hurt.
752000	753000	Done.
753000	756000	They don't sit there three years later and go, I'm such a fuckup.
756000	758000	I'm such a fuckup.
758000	764000	Because their brains are the size of ping pong balls compared to it.
764000	768000	Well, we could learn a thing or two or unlearn a thing or two from a creature
768000	770000	with a brain the size of a ping pong ball.
770000	776000	We can't learn anything from a ping pong ball size brain.
776000	779000	A parakeet sister and pecks its own reflection and gets in a big fight
779000	781000	until the beat breaks.
781000	785000	But then it learns, you know, it doesn't make that mistake again.
785000	788000	Parakeets don't learn shit.
788000	790000	Fuck parakeets.
790000	792000	I'm coming down hard on parakeets, you guys.
792000	800000	I'm going to do what my therapist taught me to do.
800000	802000	So that's the other thing.
802000	806000	So we all, I have a shame button.
806000	821000	Is it called your dick?
821000	824000	And can I push it?
824000	825000	It is my dick.
825000	828000	It's called my shame button.
828000	832000	I have a shame button and it can get put.
832000	835000	Our buttons get pushed by other people, but it's not their fault.
835000	836000	It's our deal.
836000	839000	Your buttons get pushed and then you don't have to react to it.
839000	844000	So if something makes you feel like a classic fight that I would have with Aaron,
844000	850000	believe it or not, would stem from if I take a nap and I wake up and there's six texts
850000	851000	and she's going, where are you?
851000	852000	What's going on?
852000	853000	What's happening?
853000	856000	Then I would have my shame button pushed because I would be like, oh,
856000	861000	I did something wrong as a husband because I didn't respond to the first five texts.
861000	863000	And then I'd be like, why don't you calm down?
863000	864000	It's only been an hour.
864000	874000	Like trying to fix her instead of just going like, hey, baby, I was just taking a nap.
874000	875000	This is breathing.
875000	877000	It turns out that's it.
877000	882000	Seems like it seems like it was right under my nose.
882000	884000	You could even do it with your nose.
884000	889000	Yeah, I'm not going to let that get to me.
889000	891000	The word play.
891000	894000	Anyways, I usually have to take a couple of deep breaths.
894000	895000	Just one.
895000	896000	No, it's not.
896000	897000	Yeah, it's not just.
897000	899000	Well, I mean, it could be just one like in a conversation.
899000	902000	Like if you were hanging out at a bar or something and somebody like said something,
902000	904000	the minute you feel yourself.
904000	907000	See, the goal is you got to keep your shame tube totally empty.
907000	912000	Like your, your, your, your nervous system.
912000	920000	I'm not going to, I'm not going to look at him.
920000	921000	I don't know.
921000	923000	She never even said shame tube.
923000	924000	I just.
924000	927000	Did you just empty your shame tube?
927000	930000	If you push my, if you push my.
930000	931000	I'll be right back.
931000	935000	Shame tube will empty.
935000	941000	You got it like, like your nervous system, you know, so you go from zero to 10, like,
941000	947000	and I'm usually at a five, which is bad because if I'm at a five and somebody pushes my shame
947000	949000	button, I'm going to go to six and then right up to 10.
949000	953000	Like I, it's like, it's always been like a binary switch for me, but instead four times
953000	958000	a day, Jeff, I'm supposed to take four deep breaths out of four, four counts on the inhale
958000	964000	and four count on the exhale four times, four times a day for a total of 16 four second
964000	968000	breaths.
968000	969000	And that's it.
969000	972000	And now I'm going to be sane.
972000	973000	It's going to work.
973000	974000	Have you done your breath today?
974000	975000	I didn't today.
975000	980000	Aaron's out of town and I was just playing video games.
980000	981000	I was just playing video games all day.
981000	983000	I don't need to breathe for that.
983000	987000	It's like, I'm getting mad at a dragon or something and be like, fuck you.
987000	989000	That's what you're supposed to do.
989000	990000	It's called playing the game.
990000	992000	Could it be fucking hotter up here?
992000	993000	It's very hot.
993000	994000	Sorry.
994000	995000	Sorry.
995000	999000	Uh, I'm supposed to, okay, look, all right.
999000	1002000	I'm supposed to tell people six seasons in an Emmy.
1002000	1004000	I'm supposed to like spread the word.
1004000	1005000	It's really embarrassing.
1005000	1006000	I don't want to ask for an Emmy.
1006000	1007000	I'm not Seth MacFarlane.
1007000	1008000	I just, I don't know.
1008000	1016000	I mean, if that's, if that's grown, where, I mean, he literally did at one point, like,
1016000	1018000	but I kind of don't blame him, I guess.
1018000	1020000	Cause he's like at a certain point, it's like, what do you have to do?
1020000	1021000	Ask for it.
1021000	1025000	I'm not going to ask for it, but Yahoo deserves it because they spent a lot of money in an
1025000	1026000	Emmy campaign.
1026000	1028000	So, and they're the ones asking me to do it.
1028000	1031000	And I don't want to say no to them based on some weird integrity I have.
1031000	1033000	So I'm just saying like, I don't know how that helps.
1033000	1035000	What is everybody going to run out to the Emmy factory?
1035000	1036000	I don't understand.
1036000	1040000	I don't, I don't, I thought you're supposed to get the one if your show's good.
1040000	1042000	I don't, I don't, I don't like this.
1042000	1043000	I don't like life.
1043000	1044000	I don't like this world.
1048000	1053000	Is there a way, are they hoping that that becomes a hashtag or a trending thing that that will
1053000	1054000	Yeah.
1054000	1056000	And I guess I'd say, I don't know what I don't know.
1056000	1059000	Is it that, I don't know what the Emmys respond to.
1059000	1060000	I don't know.
1060000	1061000	I don't know.
1061000	1066000	I had a, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I don't know if, I don't know if Danny Pooty would appreciate
1066000	1070000	me repeating the story, but he said he was hanging out all night with, he met a friend
1070000	1074000	of a friend who was like on, on like the Emmy committee or something.
1074000	1077000	And they were having a great time and they had dinner with their mutual friends and they're,
1077000	1080000	they're all hanging out and they had a big, long dinner and they're all joking around
1080000	1081000	and getting along.
1081000	1084000	And then they're, they went dancing afterward and they're out on the dance floor.
1084000	1088000	And the, the person finally comes up to him after talking to him all night.
1088000	1091000	And this is like, it's like, by the way, I just gotta, I gotta ask you like, what's
1091000	1093000	it like to work with Amy Poehler?
1093000	1099000	Uh, thought he was a Z's and sorry all night, all night.
1099000	1105000	They thought he was a Z's and sorry all night.
1105000	1109000	I think that's how the Emmys work for you.
1109000	1111000	I don't know.
1111000	1116000	I hear that story and I go, I don't think, I don't think it's going to happen for us.
1117000	1119000	Cause isn't it really, what it is, is it's voting for.
1119000	1120000	Do you see Parks and Rec.
1120000	1123000	Mind the guy Emmys when they thought it was Danny Pudi the whole time?
1123000	1126000	Hey, that's, I want a recount.
1126000	1131000	Everybody who said, I want to, I want to know which Brown guy did you think you were voting
1131000	1132000	for?
1132000	1133000	I want everybody to follow up ballot.
1133000	1136000	Like if you, I, we have friends that are on TV, like do commercials and you go, hey,
1136000	1138000	I love your, uh, your course light commercial.
1138000	1139000	They go, it's, it's Bud Light.
1139000	1144000	The thing is like people in advertising know that Bud Light commercials don't sell Bud
1144000	1145000	Light in particular.
1145000	1146000	They sell beer.
1146000	1148000	A Toyota commercial doesn't necessarily sell Toyotas.
1148000	1149000	It sells cars.
1149000	1153000	You are not going to buy a Toyota if you weren't already going to buy a Toyota.
1153000	1158000	If you were in the market for Mercedes Benz or a Chevy or whatever, car commercials remind
1158000	1159000	you about cars.
1159000	1163000	Apparently Danny Pudi reminds them about, about Brown people.
1165000	1166000	That's his job.
1167000	1168000	Uh, all right.
1168000	1173000	Well anyways, I hate this fucking watch and I hate, I hate, I hate, I hate, I hate my
1173000	1174000	life and I hate myself.
1174000	1175000	Are you a prisoner of the watch right now?
1175000	1176000	Yes.
1176000	1177000	I hate it.
1177000	1178000	I hate the watch.
1178000	1179000	I hate it.
1179000	1180000	I hate the watch.
1180000	1181000	It's a stupid product.
1181000	1182000	Don't buy it.
1182000	1183000	It's dumb.
1183000	1184000	It's a tiny little shitty iPad on your wrist.
1184000	1186000	It's the Bluetooth sucks from your phone.
1186000	1188000	It's supposed to, it fucking doesn't work.
1188000	1189000	It's dumb.
1190000	1192000	Do you have your phone on you to eat for the watch?
1192000	1193000	Of course you do.
1193000	1194000	It's garbage.
1194000	1195000	It's a garbage product.
1195000	1196000	That's pretty brave, man.
1196000	1197000	What?
1197000	1199000	You're admitting, you know, that you met, you got it.
1199000	1200000	It was silly.
1200000	1202000	No, I kind of, I mean, I knew it would be.
1202000	1203000	It's not that brave.
1203000	1205000	I think it's very brave.
1213000	1216000	All these tweets, I mean, all your tweets are dumb too.
1218000	1219000	Is it the heat that's getting to your eyes?
1219000	1220000	Yeah, it's really hot up here.
1220000	1222000	I feel like it's dripping down my face.
1222000	1223000	I feel like a pig.
1223000	1225000	I've been very irritable the last couple of days.
1225000	1226000	I don't know what it is.
1226000	1227000	I think it is the heat.
1227000	1228000	I don't like when it gets hot.
1228000	1231000	The cops shot a guy in the eyeball outside Shrops place?
1231000	1232000	Yeah.
1232000	1235000	I heard he was flagging the cops down and they shot him?
1235000	1237000	Yeah, he was asking for help.
1237000	1240000	He said he needed help, and he had a towel wrapped around his arm,
1240000	1243000	and the cops said there was a gun in the towel, so they shot him in the eye
1243000	1244000	and then handcuffed him.
1244000	1246000	So they had to believe that he was saying,
1246000	1250000	help me, help me while aiming a gun with the intent to fire on them,
1250000	1252000	which is just an insane belief.
1252000	1254000	Godfather II style with the silencer.
1254000	1257000	I guess they didn't want to, I don't, I mean, look,
1257000	1259000	being a cop's a hard job.
1259000	1263000	And the guy did have a gun.
1263000	1264000	He didn't.
1264000	1265000	They turned out he didn't.
1265000	1266000	Okay.
1266000	1267000	Well, okay.
1267000	1268000	That's fucked up.
1268000	1270000	So they looked at the towel and thought that's a gun?
1270000	1271000	Yeah.
1271000	1274000	I mean, that's the, here's the thing is that like, I smoke a lot of pot.
1274000	1279000	I've seen like, I've seen people that turned out to be mailboxes,
1279000	1283000	like the, you know, the human brain can shift items
1283000	1285000	and make them look really crazy.
1285000	1289000	Like you gotta, you shouldn't like fire a weapon before you make sure
1289000	1291000	that you're seeing what you're seeing.
1291000	1294000	Cause everyone, you know, everyone's brain fucks up.
1294000	1295000	Yeah.
1295000	1296000	On the flip side of that,
1296000	1300000	we never talked about that guy outside the, that gallery.
1300000	1303000	I can't remember what was now, was it Austin, someplace in Texas,
1303000	1306000	they're having that dumb gallery where they're having the draw
1306000	1309000	Mohammed contest and the guys showed up in the sedan
1309000	1312000	and they had assault rifles and they were going to head into the gallery.
1312000	1316000	The one, there was one cop on duty outside the place and he like shot them both.
1316000	1317000	Yeah.
1317000	1320000	It's like a, like a weird Western story.
1320000	1325000	Like he took them both out under a rain of assault rifle fire,
1325000	1329000	like shot them both dead.
1329000	1330000	Yeah.
1330000	1333000	And so he and the two guys were the only casualties, right?
1333000	1338000	And like, we can be pretty sure that he probably saved 30 people's lives or so.
1338000	1339000	I mean, at least, yeah.
1339000	1340000	Pretty well.
1340000	1347000	I mean, I mean, sometimes cops shooting people is great.
1347000	1350000	If they were going to, if they were about to shoot more people, I don't know.
1350000	1353000	I don't know what the fuck to think about this cop stuff.
1353000	1357000	I think it's so weird that our phones started being able to pick up on this stuff.
1357000	1361000	And I don't think, I don't think our phones got sophisticated at the same time as cops
1361000	1364000	started being crazy.
1364000	1368000	The underclass has cameras on them at all times and they get to film their friends
1368000	1370000	being shot in the back and shit.
1370000	1372000	So like it's been happening all the time.
1372000	1374000	It's been going on forever and ever and ever.
1374000	1380000	And now the underclass and like not rich people get to have access to footage and shit.
1380000	1383000	So I had a pitch and you guys are going to go, this is stupid.
1383000	1384000	You're stupid.
1384000	1385000	You're dumb.
1385000	1386000	Oh, I like this one.
1386000	1387000	I don't care.
1387000	1388000	Fuck you.
1388000	1389000	It's your problem.
1389000	1390000	You push that button.
1390000	1391000	I don't care.
1391000	1392000	You're done.
1392000	1393000	You're made of smoke.
1393000	1397000	I'm made of light.
1397000	1398000	I'm a quarter.
1398000	1401000	I'm a quarter through the book and I'm reasonably certain I've got it.
1401000	1402000	Here's my pitch.
1402000	1404000	Are there people who smoke?
1404000	1407000	If I say so.
1407000	1409000	And they're glue.
1409000	1412000	Here's my pitch.
1412000	1417000	So here's the problem is that the cops look like, you know, they look like enforcers.
1417000	1418000	They're wearing black.
1418000	1421000	They have guns on their hips.
1421000	1423000	They go into these terrible situations.
1423000	1425000	They never know what they're getting into.
1425000	1427000	They're all jacked up.
1427000	1430000	The people that they're visiting are not having their best day.
1430000	1431000	Never.
1431000	1434000	You're never a cop talking to someone who's having a good day.
1434000	1440000	They're always like all, you know, it's like everything is a fucking powder keg and everyone's
1440000	1441000	got a gun.
1441000	1443000	So here's my pitch.
1443000	1444000	All right.
1444000	1451000	So special branch of the police force called the peacekeepers.
1451000	1452000	Okay.
1452000	1456000	Head to toe white spandex.
1456000	1458000	No weapons.
1458000	1460000	Cameras all over them.
1460000	1462000	And like fingerprint sensors.
1462000	1463000	Two.
1463000	1468000	Because the rule is if you touch one of them, automatic lethal injection.
1468000	1471000	Like let alone if you shoot one or anything.
1471000	1473000	I didn't think you were going to go in that direction.
1473000	1476000	It has to be backed up.
1476000	1481000	The peacekeepers and white spandex seemed a lot more laissez-faire than that.
1481000	1484000	They are laissez-faire because if you touch one you're fucked.
1484000	1486000	Like you're dead.
1486000	1491000	You might as well, I mean there's problems with this pitch but we'll refine it.
1491000	1494000	What if you're falling over and you accidentally like you need help?
1494000	1497000	You're nitpicking the wrong thing because I haven't finished my pitch.
1497000	1498000	Okay.
1498000	1500000	So the point is they have no gun.
1500000	1501000	They have no gun.
1501000	1504000	So when you see these guys you know they don't have a gun.
1504000	1507000	It's not their job to like, they don't even have handcuffs.
1507000	1511000	It's not their job to shoot you or arrest you or anything.
1511000	1518000	It's their job to, they have conflict training and they get paid $700,000 a year
1518000	1523000	because they'll probably die within a week of, but that's capitalism.
1523000	1528000	It's like hey, $700,000 a year and you're probably going to die.
1528000	1533000	And so whenever there's a police call they're the first ones in and they come in and they go,
1533000	1537000	hey, take it easy.
1537000	1538000	I'm a peacekeeper.
1538000	1539000	What's going on?
1539000	1540000	I just want to know.
1540000	1542000	I just want to help out.
1542000	1544000	And they have to have that accent.
1544000	1546000	I like this.
1546000	1549000	And then like, but then again, if you have to answer your question,
1549000	1554000	if you fall and accidentally touch them, yeah, lethal injection.
1554000	1557000	And I know you're going to ask, well, wouldn't that give rise to a generation
1557000	1561000	that would murder people by pushing them into peacekeepers?
1561000	1563000	I'm way ahead of you there.
1563000	1565000	That was my next question.
1565000	1570000	They're also going to be floating beholders.
1570000	1572000	Yeah.
1572000	1575000	That watch in case that happens.
1575000	1581000	So if that happens, if that happens, poison darts at the person that pushed.
1581000	1583000	The floating beholder has poison darts?
1583000	1584000	Yeah.
1584000	1586000	If you see those things coming.
1586000	1588000	Raise a disintegration, sure.
1588000	1590000	Poison darts, I don't know.
1590000	1591000	They're not.
1591000	1593000	It's not that beholder.
1593000	1596000	They're just called beholders and have poison darts.
1596000	1597000	Yeah.
1597000	1598000	Okay.
1598000	1599000	That explains.
1599000	1601000	Is anyone else imagining Jim Rash as a peacekeeper?
1601000	1602000	Yeah.
1602000	1607000	Because that's who I keep thinking of.
1607000	1609000	But somewhere in there is the germ of a good idea.
1609000	1610000	Yeah.
1610000	1612000	Because as you and I were discussing.
1612000	1613000	We were talking about this.
1613000	1616000	The actual problem is that, well, the way to break the cycle
1616000	1622000	is that the community think about police as being there to actually help.
1622000	1626000	But every time you see them, you're just like, oh, fuck.
1626000	1631000	Unless you're like, I mean, if you're terrified for your fucking life.
1631000	1633000	Which also needs to be mentioned.
1633000	1634000	I mean, Jesus Christ, man.
1634000	1636000	You get that shit scared out of you.
1636000	1638000	And sometimes when the cops show up and they're nice and you're like,
1638000	1640000	holy fuck, thank God for the police.
1640000	1642000	Somebody I saw that made a very interesting point.
1642000	1646000	That there was a, they showed the picture of that asshole that shot all the
1646000	1648000	people at the church in South Carolina.
1648000	1651000	And he's got a bullet for a vest on.
1651000	1654000	He's being escorted very quietly and casually to a car.
1654000	1657000	And then a black guy down on the ground for selling cigarettes,
1657000	1660000	like with three cops on top of him, like strangling him.
1660000	1661000	Yep.
1661000	1662000	That guy died.
1662000	1664000	There's different ways of being arrested.
1664000	1668000	And we treat, we treat the little white guy that kills a bunch of fucking people
1668000	1672000	like, uh, for no, I mean, for no good reason, uh, with a lot of respect and a
1672000	1674000	lot of courtesy and a lot of care.
1674000	1676000	It's absolutely crazy.
1676000	1677000	What was with the bullet?
1677000	1679000	Were people really afraid he was going to get shot?
1679000	1681000	Like walking to the police car?
1681000	1685000	Like Captain America didn't get a bulletproof vest.
1685000	1687000	Oh, they, they put a vest on him.
1687000	1688000	Yeah.
1688000	1690000	To walk him like in public.
1690000	1693000	Ostensibly because they don't want him to die before we can find out why he did
1693000	1695000	it and get to get the dope on him.
1695000	1698000	Uh, but I don't think that happens to, uh, to black suspect.
1698000	1701000	I don't think we give them the bulletproof vest and the perp walk in front of all
1701000	1702000	the media and shit.
1702000	1704000	It's, uh, I find it pretty shitty.
1704000	1707000	And that creepy ass judge, you see that thing of the, uh, that little hearing
1707000	1711000	where, where he, he wanted the families of the, of the shooter to make sure that,
1711000	1713000	that, that we all knew that they were victims too.
1713000	1718000	That was a little cynical with that in front of the families of all of the, of
1718000	1721000	the victims were all allowed to make a comment where they put this guy on a
1721000	1724000	video arraignment or whatever it was like a pretrial kind of thing.
1724000	1726000	And the guy said, let's not forget about the family of the shooter.
1726000	1727000	Yeah.
1727000	1728000	Oh boy.
1728000	1733000	That's in an unrelated case.
1733000	1734000	Yeah.
1734000	1735000	Yeah.
1735000	1736000	I don't know.
1736000	1738000	I mean, I think I, I think I got where he was coming from on that when it was
1738000	1741000	like, like, let's like, believe me, like we're all, we're all victims of a
1741000	1743000	crime like this and let's, let's not all go crazy.
1743000	1745000	I don't think anybody was going to go crazy.
1745000	1749000	I think that guy just wanted that judge just wanted to be kind of a hotshot and
1749000	1751000	like, like, like he was on camera.
1751000	1754000	So he's going to have a movie moment where he made sure the white family of
1754000	1758000	this white little fucking pecker would kind of fucking like it was, it was,
1758000	1761000	it was, it was taken care of.
1761000	1762000	Yeah.
1762000	1763000	I said pecker would cut.
1763000	1769000	And if that's not the name of this episode of Harmontown, I'm leaving.
1769000	1770000	You're leaving.
1770000	1772000	You're leaving the show forever.
1772000	1775000	I'll never come back again.
1775000	1778000	Is it allowed to be this way?
1778000	1780000	And he put the C word in the title.
1780000	1781000	I don't know.
1781000	1784000	I'm sure iTunes has some algorithm.
1784000	1785000	Yeah.
1785000	1787000	I mean, it's, I don't know.
1787000	1791000	I don't want to, I don't want to pour a bunch of white guilt kerosene on that
1791000	1796000	white guilt bonfire, but like, Jesus Christ.
1796000	1800000	I think the, I, I, the thing that.
1800000	1801000	Talking about white guilt.
1801000	1806000	The thing that.
1806000	1809000	He wasn't even, he wasn't even white.
1809000	1812000	He, yeah, he was Italian.
1812000	1818000	I don't, I don't let Italians convince you they're not white.
1818000	1821000	A lot of them will try to make you think they're not.
1821000	1825000	That's the first thing that I tell you is going to try to make you believe.
1825000	1828000	Hey, you got some problems with your sink.
1828000	1830000	By the way, I'm a white.
1830000	1831000	No, Mario.
1831000	1833000	No.
1833000	1834000	You're Italian.
1834000	1838000	Go, go fight the Oompa Loops or whatever.
1838000	1839000	That's your job.
1839000	1846000	That's your, that's your racially designated job is to kick turtles and blow
1846000	1848000	fireballs out of your nose.
1848000	1849000	Sorry.
1849000	1852000	It's some stereotypes are true.
1852000	1856000	Uh, no, I went out when I was going to say, it was a, it's, it's like, like,
1856000	1865000	you think that bums me out when that happens is actually how, like, how.
1865000	1870000	How used to it, the black community is like, like they, they, they, like, I
1870000	1874000	always project onto when, when shit like this happens where it's like totally
1874000	1879000	racially like hot, uh, I always like put myself in the shoes of someone.
1879000	1882000	That's a, that's part of this category and affected by this.
1882000	1887000	And then I'm, and then always with, with the African-American community,
1887000	1891000	it's just like, that's the fucking saddest part of it is that they're not as
1891000	1896000	mad because they're just like, what, what the fuck did you think this world was?
1896000	1900000	Like, like, like, like when Kramer said the N word on stage, it was like, wow,
1900000	1901000	that's, that's a big deal.
1901000	1903000	And they're like, no, it's not.
1903000	1905000	And I'm like, Oh God, Jesus Christ.
1905000	1908000	Oh, it's just fucking like, and then this happened and it's like, there's no,
1908000	1909000	there's no riots.
1909000	1911000	There's no, there's no, this is not.
1911000	1914000	But let's say, let's say black community got up and got really pissed off and
1914000	1915000	started rioting.
1915000	1916000	Then what?
1916000	1917000	Exactly.
1917000	1920000	That's the thing is like they, they, now I'm dehumanizing by talking about they,
1920000	1925000	but I'm saying like they, that community knows that, that, that's the,
1925000	1928000	that's the greatest thing they could do for racism, you know,
1928000	1929000	is to react.
1929000	1931000	And it's like this fucking horrible syndrome.
1931000	1932000	It's like, it's like,
1932000	1936000	we figured out Swiss army knives of oppression because the butcher knife
1936000	1938000	stopped working in the 1800s.
1938000	1942000	So now we've got it down to fucking corkscrews and little can openers.
1942000	1945000	That asshole said he wanted to try to start a race war in America.
1945000	1950000	And I hope that he did like everything he could to make sure that that never
1950000	1951000	happens.
1951000	1954000	Like, but actually the opposite happens from that, that even like anybody that
1954000	1957000	might've been on the racial fence and that one is pushed to the, the side of
1957000	1959000	decency and like Jesus Christ.
1959000	1964000	I think the only, the only hope is we gotta, we gotta, we gotta, we gotta,
1964000	1967000	we gotta realize that this whole thing is a dodge.
1967000	1970000	All this, all this race shit is a, is a, is a, it's just,
1970000	1973000	it's just a distraction from the class, class warfare.
1973000	1976000	It's just a, all it is is just poor people.
1976000	1980000	Their worst nightmare is all poor people feeling the same way because then if
1980000	1985000	there's that and then there's also democracy, then it's legal to overthrow.
1985000	1989000	And as long as all the poor people are like, you're a racist, you're a sexist,
1989000	1990000	you're a pedophile.
1990000	1994000	See, stop judging the pedophiles.
1994000	1996000	I keep saying let's join forces with them.
1996000	2001000	You can't, you can't pick your bedfellows in a revolution.
2001000	2005000	You know, we'll be, we're going to be storming the Capitol and, and then just,
2005000	2009000	just when the, just when the Sentinels are like blasting us with the, the
2009000	2011000	rays, we're going to be like, oh, we're pinned down.
2011000	2013000	I can't, this is it.
2013000	2014000	I'm sorry.
2014000	2016000	Black, black guy.
2016000	2018000	It's all right, white guy.
2018000	2020000	We, at least we, at least we're going to die as brothers.
2020000	2021000	Yeah.
2021000	2022000	Wait, did you hear that?
2022000	2029000	Look, pedophiles.
2029000	2032000	Flank left on my word.
2032000	2034000	Dive, dive.
2034000	2037000	Second wave, dive.
2037000	2041000	Wait, are the pedophiles played by Brian Blessed from, from Flash Gordon?
2041000	2044000	The pedophiles are the Hawkmen from Flash Gordon.
2044000	2058000	Go to tonight and he's 12.
2058000	2060000	And then, and then the white guy and the black guy look at each other and they
2060000	2064000	go, and he poured in a storm.
2064000	2069000	I don't know why you groaned at that.
2069000	2075000	You were having a pretty good time when the pedophiles were flying.
2075000	2076000	I guess I gilded the lid.
2076000	2077000	I don't know.
2077000	2079000	It's just, you made it too real all of a sudden.
2079000	2080000	Yeah.
2080000	2081000	I guess, I guess because the protagonist signed off on it.
2081000	2082000	Is that what it was?
2082000	2083000	Okay.
2083000	2086000	All right.
2086000	2091000	Let me just random, random one of your tweets.
2091000	2094000	I just, I like flying pedophiles.
2094000	2095000	Can't that be the title?
2095000	2100000	Flap pedophiles.
2100000	2101000	Pedophiles.
2101000	2102000	Dive.
2102000	2103000	Pedophiles.
2103000	2104000	Pedophiles.
2104000	2105000	Dive, dive.
2105000	2106000	I got to rent Flash Gordon again.
2106000	2108000	That would be so good.
2108000	2110000	Dan, can you validate me?
2110000	2112000	No, I can't because these fucking tweets keep coming in.
2112000	2113000	Sorry.
2113000	2115000	Whoever that was, you're validated.
2115000	2121000	Is that a, is that a parking thing?
2121000	2123000	What else was I going to talk about?
2123000	2124000	Oh, hey Spencer.
2124000	2125000	Hey.
2125000	2127000	How's your, how's your, are you twitching now?
2127000	2128000	Oh yeah.
2128000	2129000	I'm twitching.
2129000	2130000	Spencer's twitching.
2130000	2132000	I really got to get it looked at.
2132000	2134000	Is that a new dance move?
2134000	2135000	Oh yeah.
2135000	2137000	Spencer, Spencer got us equipment.
2137000	2140000	I haven't hooked mine up, but so that we could show people our
2140000	2144000	Minecraft worlds, like on YouTube and whatnot, or?
2144000	2145000	Yeah, or Twitch.
2145000	2146000	Or on Twitch.
2146000	2147000	On Twitch.
2147000	2150000	And so the Twitch puts it on the YouTubes?
2151000	2153000	You do that yourself, actually.
2153000	2154000	It's not.
2154000	2155000	So Twitch is a thing.
2155000	2156000	It's an internet.
2156000	2159000	It's like YouTube for video games and live.
2159000	2162000	It's the weirdest, it's the weirdest social phenomenon in
2162000	2163000	the world.
2163000	2165000	So you can stream your, your video game play.
2165000	2166000	Yeah.
2166000	2167000	Yeah.
2167000	2169000	People, and people are positively like it's actually
2169000	2170000	working.
2170000	2172000	Like people like to watch other people play video games.
2172000	2175000	I wouldn't, would have never predicted that.
2175000	2177000	And they like tip them and stuff.
2177000	2179000	It's, I mean, I don't know.
2179000	2182000	I feel the same thing about sports though, right?
2182000	2185000	It's like, why are people watching people play sports?
2185000	2187000	Well, that's, yeah, I guess.
2187000	2188000	I mean, yeah, but yeah.
2188000	2191000	I think it's probably that same human impulse probably.
2191000	2192000	I don't know.
2192000	2195000	But yeah, the thing I can't, but yeah.
2195000	2196000	Okay.
2196000	2197000	I mean, it's a lot of fun.
2197000	2198000	Spencer, do you watch other people?
2198000	2201000	No, I think that's a hilariously dumb.
2203000	2206000	So, I mean, not if you're watching me, of course.
2206000	2207000	That's the best thing you could do.
2207000	2209000	But you put your stuff out there and do you have a following now?
2209000	2211000	I mean, there's four or five people.
2211000	2212000	Yeah.
2212000	2213000	Yeah.
2213000	2214000	I don't do it for them.
2214000	2220000	I do it to feel like I'm wasting less time when I'm wasting time.
2220000	2222000	Because now you've become entertainment for other people.
2222000	2224000	I mean, yeah, now it's actually doing something.
2224000	2227000	It's not just going into the, yeah, into the past.
2227000	2230000	So people sit and watch you Minecraft and you're moving little blocks around?
2230000	2231000	Yeah.
2231000	2232000	And sometimes I'm saying.
2232000	2233000	I'll sit and watch for hours.
2233000	2236000	I'll watch Minecraft tutorials and stuff because people, because there's so
2236000	2239000	many mods and then people, I'll go like, how do you, how the fuck do these
2239000	2240000	wires work or whatever?
2240000	2241000	And then some guy will have a thing.
2241000	2243000	It goes like, hello, I'm Mr.
2243000	2245000	pasty pants and I'm going to show you how wires work.
2245000	2247000	Oh, look over here.
2247000	2248000	You see, I've put a one way switch.
2248000	2251000	You have to put it at the top of the block and never put it facing the north
2251000	2252000	or it won't work.
2252000	2253000	I don't know why that is.
2253000	2254000	I sent the blood report to the author.
2254000	2255000	Yeah.
2255000	2260000	So anyways, like they do characters and stuff and, but they show you how shit
2260000	2261000	works.
2261000	2262000	Is that what you do?
2262000	2265000	Are you showing people like, like, like how you know, I'm just fucking,
2265000	2266000	I'm just playing now.
2266000	2269000	Like I'm just playing it and people ask me questions and I answer their
2269000	2270000	questions.
2270000	2273000	Is it like a weird sort of voyeurism where they're watching Spencer's mind
2273000	2274000	at work?
2274000	2275000	I mean, I guess.
2275000	2276000	I don't know.
2276000	2278000	Well, like I said, I think it's the sports thing here.
2278000	2279000	Follow somebody else.
2279000	2280000	You in the front row.
2280000	2283000	You, you watch people twitching.
2283000	2284000	Really?
2284000	2285000	Yeah.
2285000	2288000	Well, so if you're sitting at work and you can't play, but you want to watch
2288000	2289000	a game.
2289000	2291000	So which, which games do you watch?
2291000	2292000	I watch League of Legends.
2292000	2293000	I watch Minecraft sometimes.
2293000	2294000	Hearthstone.
2294000	2295000	Bot the Hearthstone.
2295000	2297000	You watch people play Hearthstone.
2297000	2303000	Hearthstone is like a card game and you watch, you watch strangers play it
2303000	2304000	against each other.
2304000	2307000	Well, you watch the stranger playing against somebody.
2307000	2308000	Uh-huh.
2308000	2309000	Wait.
2309000	2314000	It might be a stranger or they might be playing someone you know.
2314000	2316000	Oh, okay.
2316000	2321000	Uh, I just, I, I, I, I'm, I'm, I'm fascinated by the fact that it's kind of
2321000	2323000	scratched the same itch for you.
2323000	2324000	What's your name by the way?
2324000	2327000	Oh, that means I get to sit down.
2327000	2330000	Skylar, come on up.
2330000	2334000	Skylar be twitching.
2334000	2337000	Have you, or do you ever watch sports?
2337000	2338000	Do you fall?
2338000	2339000	God, no.
2339000	2340000	Huh?
2340000	2341000	God, no.
2341000	2342000	God, no.
2342000	2343000	So no, you don't, you don't watch a baseball game.
2343000	2346000	Do you think that scratch is the same sort of itch that somebody who likes
2346000	2347000	football?
2347000	2348000	I would assume so.
2348000	2349000	Yeah.
2349000	2350000	It's a spectator sport.
2350000	2351000	Yeah.
2351000	2352000	Yeah.
2352000	2353000	I'm sorry.
2353000	2354000	I want there to be more here.
2354000	2356000	I can't, I can't figure out.
2356000	2360000	I mean, I, you know, I've had Superman explained to me and I get it now.
2360000	2363000	That's a lot of pressure.
2363000	2366000	But the thing I haven't done is I haven't, I haven't like gotten on Twitch and
2366000	2369000	actually tried this, but Spencer, are you, when you're, when you're twitching.
2369000	2370000	Yeah.
2370000	2371000	As the kids call it.
2371000	2372000	They do.
2372000	2374000	And you're, you're doing exclusively Minecraft.
2374000	2376000	Are you talking to people?
2376000	2377000	Yeah.
2377000	2379000	I'm like, there's a chat room and I see it on my phone.
2379000	2383000	So people are like, Oh, what color is your house going to be?
2383000	2385000	And then I'll be all like, I don't know.
2385000	2386000	Maybe red.
2386000	2387000	And they're like, I'd like blue.
2387000	2389000	And then I'd be like, okay.
2389000	2392000	You know, so, and I think there is some, I don't know.
2392000	2395000	I think people get something from the interaction.
2395000	2398000	And also I think it's kind of like podcast thing where it's like you're
2398000	2401000	interacting with this person kind of in this very limited sense where you're
2401000	2403000	sort of exposing yourself to them.
2403000	2404000	Yeah.
2404000	2408000	It's very easy, but very distant and controlled human interaction.
2408000	2409000	It's a, it's a community.
2409000	2413000	Like, it's just like the show is really people watching the podcast through
2413000	2414000	the streaming and stuff like that.
2414000	2417000	But with like, now that I know that Spencer has a Twitch, I'll totally watch
2417000	2418000	Spencer play Minecraft.
2418000	2419000	Yay.
2419000	2422000	Well, I would too, cause can I watch you watch Spencer play?
2422000	2424000	That's going to be the new thing.
2424000	2425000	We could do Twitchception.
2425000	2426000	Yeah.
2426000	2427000	I want to be in the room.
2427000	2429000	I want to be physically in the room while you watch it.
2429000	2430000	Sure.
2430000	2432000	Oh, I want to stand there in white spandex.
2433000	2434000	But I can't touch you.
2434000	2435000	I can't touch you.
2435000	2436000	You're fucking dead, Jack.
2436000	2440000	I really wanted this to happen where I could touch you, but all right.
2444000	2449000	You can touch my floating beholders with their disintegration rays and their
2449000	2450000	anti-magic fields.
2452000	2453000	It's an important aspect.
2453000	2456000	It is the scariest part.
2456000	2457000	Yeah.
2457000	2458000	Don't forget.
2458000	2459000	You lose all your bonuses.
2459000	2460000	It's terrible.
2460000	2461000	Yeah.
2461000	2462000	All right.
2462000	2465000	So what do you play when you play?
2465000	2466000	You play a heart stone.
2466000	2468000	You play, you play the things you watch.
2469000	2474000	The last time I streamed Twitch where I was producing Twitch that people
2474000	2479000	could watch, I played a game called magic a two and it's where four wizards cast
2479000	2482000	spells cooperatively where your spells can hit each other.
2482000	2484000	So you blow each other up and yell at each other a lot.
2484000	2490000	So we just threw the whole game in one sitting, but all yelling at each other
2490000	2491000	on a couch.
2491000	2492000	We got the cops called on us.
2492000	2493000	It was really good.
2493000	2494000	Damn.
2494000	2495000	It was fucking rager.
2495000	2501000	I understand the idea of like, like I would, I would, if I had time, I would
2501000	2504000	want to, that's why I asked you to look into getting the stuff because I wanted
2504000	2508000	to be one of these guys who has like a YouTube video, but like I wanted to have
2508000	2514000	control over, like I want to go, hello, it's me, Dan, Dan, snake bite 69 or
2514000	2515000	whatever.
2515000	2519000	I just wanted to show you my automatic irrigation system or something over here.
2519000	2522000	So you don't want to stream, you want to produce content that you have edited
2522000	2523000	and then voiced over.
2523000	2527000	Because I'm nervous about the idea of people watching me in real time because
2527000	2532000	if I'm playing Minecraft, like, like, and I stack up some blocks and then I'm
2532000	2535000	just like sitting there, I got someone's watching.
2535000	2537000	No, it's a nightmare.
2537000	2539000	I'm just going to be the guy that says this.
2539000	2542000	On your screen, you're seeing people comment like bad block placement.
2542000	2546000	Quit watering the plants, you dick.
2546000	2547000	Are you?
2547000	2550000	No, no, no.
2550000	2554000	I would say that you playing Minecraft and having a community watching you and like
2554000	2556000	messaging you like, oh, you should go over there.
2556000	2559000	That looks like there's goats or something like it probably way more interesting
2559000	2563000	than watching you look at your phone in front of a mic or look at your watch.
2563000	2564000	Check Twitter.
2564000	2565000	All right.
2565000	2568000	Well, it's all right.
2568000	2569000	Shit.
2569000	2570000	Take a deep breath.
2570000	2573000	Take a deep breath.
2573000	2576000	It's it's hilarious that I'm sitting up here and speaking to one of my heroes
2576000	2584000	criticizing him looking at his Twitter like like that's what I'm saying.
2584000	2590000	I'm just checking my tweets because I'm excited for my tweet hate mail.
2590000	2592000	I'm excited for that.
2592000	2593000	No, it's fine.
2593000	2597000	I mean, look, you're like, look, it's a bad show and it's not a bad show.
2597000	2598000	That's not what I'm saying.
2598000	2600000	I think you took the wrong thing out of what I was trying to say.
2600000	2601000	I don't know.
2601000	2603000	I'm saying that this is it.
2603000	2607000	I'm saying that this is a beautiful thing that people care about and can watch and still
2607000	2608000	enjoy.
2608000	2610000	And Minecraft can be that also.
2610000	2611000	Oh, right.
2611000	2614000	Well, yeah, I mean, but I but there's no wrong.
2614000	2615000	There's no wrong way to do it.
2615000	2617000	That's what I'm trying to say.
2617000	2618000	Like a Reese's.
2618000	2622000	Yeah, there's no there's no wrong way to eat a Reese's.
2622000	2623000	Thank you, Spencer.
2623000	2624000	Thank you.
2624000	2625000	You're welcome.
2625000	2631000	There's probably a wrong way to eat it.
2632000	2633000	Forget to unwrap it first.
2633000	2634000	That's a wrong way to do it.
2634000	2635000	No, that's fine.
2635000	2636000	That's fine.
2636000	2639000	This guy says Snakebite 69 should be the name of the title.
2639000	2640000	I don't know.
2640000	2641000	No.
2641000	2642000	No.
2642000	2643000	Petipals with wings.
2643000	2644000	Fuck you, buddy.
2644000	2645000	I like this.
2645000	2647000	I like this voting on the title with the audience.
2647000	2649000	Snakebite 69.
2649000	2653000	I just the difficult thing is every time I say, OK, someone said don't give up.
2653000	2654000	OK.
2654000	2660000	Oh, but I think they I think they meant on race, race relations.
2661000	2663000	Because it was eight eight minutes ago.
2663000	2666000	So maybe it was like, don't give up on white people.
2666000	2668000	Don't give up on your peacekeepers pitch.
2668000	2670000	Yeah.
2670000	2672000	Well, somebody I'm terrified of your peacekeeper.
2672000	2676000	Yeah, because they're going to get cocky and arrogant and they're going to be
2676000	2678000	like, why don't you touch me, bro?
2678000	2681000	And they'll like be forcing you up against the corner.
2681000	2686000	If two people walked in right now, let's say it's a man and a woman and they're
2686000	2688000	peacekeepers and they're wearing white spandex.
2688000	2691000	We'd all fucking be bummed out because you're like, what if you touch them
2691000	2692000	and you'd be dead?
2692000	2693000	You don't know what's going on.
2693000	2695000	Well, that's because that's that's your signal.
2695000	2696000	Everybody fucking cool it, man.
2696000	2698000	Yeah, but that's horrifying.
2698000	2701000	Well, yeah, but they don't have guns and they don't have handcuffs.
2701000	2706000	It's horrifying the way if like if an angel came down, like it doesn't.
2706000	2707000	It doesn't.
2707000	2708000	It's potentially very horrifying.
2708000	2712000	It's it's it's it's disruptive and it's and it's hits the reset button.
2712000	2713000	Oh shit.
2713000	2715000	Fucking the fucking way.
2715000	2717000	What is the vetting system for becoming a PC?
2718000	2719000	Heavy.
2719000	2722000	You have to be willing to get killed on your first week of work.
2722000	2725000	You have the ability to run through a crowd and kill 30 people.
2725000	2726000	All right.
2726000	2727000	Well, no, no.
2727000	2733000	The vetting system is you have to have had six years of conflict resolution
2733000	2734000	training.
2734000	2739000	OK, you have a liberal arts degree.
2739000	2745000	You have to know Tai Chi just only to balance your your soul.
2745000	2746000	Right.
2746000	2749000	Or or a cheat.
2749000	2755000	Enlighten not to hurt people just to just to just to be calm when people are
2755000	2758000	killing you because you're going to die.
2758000	2762000	But then over time, what's that?
2762000	2764000	If you touch an off duty, that doesn't matter.
2764000	2767000	They wouldn't be wearing their spandex.
2767000	2770000	Well, is that is that true?
2770000	2773000	He says if you kill an off duty cop, there's a higher penalty.
2773000	2777000	Well, I guess I guess given what I guess we're not sure.
2777000	2778000	We got to go back.
2778000	2779000	I mean, we got to work.
2779000	2780000	It's a good idea.
2780000	2782000	We just got to work out the kinks.
2782000	2785000	I think they should be robots.
2785000	2786000	That's what we need.
2786000	2787000	We need those chappy robots.
2787000	2790000	Yeah.
2790000	2793000	But I don't think that would calm anybody down.
2793000	2795000	Well, they wouldn't like.
2795000	2802000	Well, they probably would recognize weapons and stuff.
2802000	2803000	British British.
2803000	2804000	Yeah.
2804000	2805000	Yeah.
2805000	2807000	He's saying that the British Bobby doesn't carry a fire.
2807000	2808000	Oh, right.
2808000	2809000	But don't they kind of do now?
2809000	2810000	Aren't there so many?
2810000	2813000	You need to justify it and buy it.
2813000	2815000	You have to accept the call out to get the free top.
2815000	2817000	But they'll beat the shit out of you.
2817000	2819000	Like it's fine.
2819000	2823000	But but they're they're more famous in the in Europe and the UK.
2823000	2825000	For beating the shit out of people.
2825000	2829000	For like actually like like casually disarming people and like talking it out.
2829000	2830000	Oh, it's amazing, man.
2830000	2833000	I saw a video of a guy with a machete.
2833000	2834000	He was swinging a machete around.
2834000	2838000	They just kept bringing more cops and some guy hit him with a chair.
2838000	2839000	No one.
2839000	2840000	No.
2840000	2841000	No.
2841000	2842000	Guns got fired.
2842000	2843000	No one got hurt.
2843000	2844000	Like the guy got arrested.
2844000	2845000	It was awesome.
2845000	2846000	Police.
2846000	2848000	It can be done.
2848000	2849000	I tell you that story.
2849000	2854000	Well, when we were in when we were there for hog money in Scotland and I bumped into a
2854000	2859000	cop and it was like New Year's Eve and everyone's drunk and I bumped into a cop and the cop
2859000	2865000	went, oh, excuse me.
2865000	2868000	I think I ran around a corner and puked.
2868000	2871000	I was like so nervous.
2871000	2873000	I can't believe that just happened.
2873000	2875000	Our first night in Edinburgh.
2875000	2879000	You guys had checked into our little apartment there and Kate and I were parking a car and
2879000	2880000	getting luggage out of the car.
2880000	2885000	And we parked right underneath like literally like the street below the Edinburgh Castle,
2885000	2887000	like in the shadow of the big castle there.
2887000	2891000	And we parked on the road and the meters, you have to go to a little kiosk, get us
2891000	2894000	a receipt, put it in your car.
2894000	2898000	You can buy a bunch of time on it, but what you can't do is feed the meter.
2898000	2901000	You can't go back in the middle of the night and add more time on that.
2901000	2903000	You have to actually move your car or whatever.
2903000	2907000	It's a pretty good system, I guess, except we didn't have any – you have to put coins
2907000	2908000	and you can't put a card in.
2908000	2909000	So we didn't have any.
2909000	2913000	So we walked up to a cafe to get some money and the time that we did that, because we
2913000	2916000	had to buy something, we came back, we're getting a ticket.
2916000	2920000	Now, in Los Angeles, I don't know about living in other parts of the country, the
2920000	2923000	U.S., the moment they're out of the car, you're getting a ticket.
2923000	2927000	The moment they start typing your license in, you have a ticket whether you drive off
2927000	2928000	in a fury.
2928000	2932000	There was this cop there and he's writing this up and Kate's like, oh, no, no, no,
2932000	2933000	no, no.
2933000	2936000	And she's Scottish, so she was like talking to him, Scottish falsetto, because they all
2936000	2937000	talk in a falsetto.
2937000	2938000	Like, oh!
2938000	2944000	And the guy just put his little computer thing in his pocket and walked away.
2945000	2946000	And she's like, do we have a ticket?
2946000	2947000	He's like, no, on you go.
2947000	2949000	And she's like, really?
2949000	2952000	And she's like, yeah, sorry, on you go.
2952000	2954000	Put your money in there and go.
2954000	2958000	And so she does that and I'm getting stuff out of the car and the cop was doing his thing
2958000	2962000	and looking around in other cars and he walks by and it's just after Christmas, right?
2962000	2965000	Or maybe it was just Christmas when we were there.
2965000	2967000	And I said, thank you very much, by the way.
2967000	2972000	I'm from Los Angeles where if someone starts writing you a ticket, you have a ticket.
2973000	2976000	And he goes, yeah, but we're nice here.
2977000	2979000	Merry Christmas.
2980000	2985000	And then the Loch Ness Monster came out and just fucking ate him.
2988000	2990000	And you were like, what?
2990000	2993000	And then it pulled back and you were outside like this lab.
2994000	2995000	What?
2999000	3001000	I was just punching it up and I had a third act problem.
3003000	3006000	Is Darsan, are you here?
3007000	3008000	Darsan?
3008000	3012000	Oh, did I slightly pronounce one vowel wrong?
3012000	3013000	Wow.
3014000	3015000	Darsan?
3016000	3017000	Do you want to come up here?
3017000	3018000	Do you want to chat?
3018000	3019000	Yeah.
3020000	3021000	No, you're staying.
3022000	3024000	What's your name, Twitch lover?
3024000	3025000	Skylar.
3025000	3026000	Skylar.
3026000	3027000	That's a pretty name.
3027000	3028000	Darsan.
3028000	3029000	Darsan, everybody.
3029000	3030000	Darsan.
3032000	3040000	Community fans may know Darsan as Black Dave from season five who rose to prominence in season six.
3041000	3047000	He came down to you and Vicky and what's his name?
3047000	3049000	The guy that made out with my wife.
3050000	3051000	Garrett, Garrett.
3053000	3060000	Yeah, because we lost Neil and then we call you guys our Muppets because you're not regulars.
3060000	3063000	You're kind of like, but you're not background and you're not guest stars.
3063000	3065000	You're kind of like always there.
3065000	3066000	Muppets, Muppets.
3066000	3067000	Yeah, Muppets.
3067000	3068000	Dehumanizing.
3069000	3070000	I'll take it.
3070000	3071000	Yeah.
3071000	3072000	Better than Black Dave.
3072000	3073000	Better than Black Dave.
3073000	3078000	Which is still somewhat dehumanizing, but I guess Muppets is less dehumanizing.
3078000	3079000	Muppets and Black Dave.
3079000	3080000	They're both neat.
3080000	3081000	Come on.
3081000	3082000	No.
3087000	3090000	You're Jewish though, right?
3090000	3091000	Yeah, I am.
3092000	3097000	Your story you were telling me in the green room, your mom's Jewish, your dad's...
3097000	3099000	Yeah, my mom's Jewish, my dad's something.
3099000	3100000	He's black.
3100000	3101000	And he was like...
3103000	3105000	Your dad was like a rambling man, right?
3106000	3109000	If there's anything you don't want to talk about, you don't have to talk about it.
3109000	3115000	Okay, so basically I was telling Dan that my dad's from Trinidad and he came from when
3115000	3117000	it was still owned by Britain.
3117000	3121000	So he kind of came out with a British accent because for whatever reason he thought that
3121000	3125000	actually talking like you were from Trinidad was really improper and all his family is
3125000	3126000	like, what the fuck?
3126000	3127000	You're crazy.
3127000	3129000	And they all talk with a Caribbean accent.
3129000	3134000	So it's more like we might be out somewhere and because black people say hi to other black
3134000	3140000	people, it's like that's a thing.
3140000	3143000	So if you walk on the street and see another black guy...
3143000	3145000	Yeah, we'd just be like, sup.
3145000	3146000	And then...
3146000	3147000	Right.
3147000	3148000	Is that like...
3148000	3150000	Is that just as a courtesy thing or as a cultural thing?
3150000	3152000	I honestly don't know.
3152000	3154000	I just have accepted it and sort of embraced it.
3154000	3156000	You guys better not be up to something.
3159000	3160000	Jeff, it's 9-11.
3160000	3161000	It's not a code, is it?
3162000	3163000	It's 9-11.
3164000	3165000	It's 9-11.
3165000	3166000	It's 9-11.
3167000	3170000	Black people are up to something!
3192000	3197000	Don't ever forget these numbers.
3197000	3206000	These numbers will make the difference when you go to bed at night and pray.
3206000	3209000	Tweet, tweet, boop, boop, t-t-t-t-twitch, twitch.
3209000	3217000	9-11 gonna be the number I remember.
3218000	3223000	9-11 gonna live forever in my mind.
3223000	3226000	Tweet, tweet, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
3226000	3227000	Matt!
3237000	3238000	Pedophiles!
3238000	3239000	Dive!
3239000	3240000	Pedophiles, dive!
3242000	3245000	I'm glad you cut it off because I was...
3246000	3248000	Osama bin Laden was about to do a rap.
3248000	3250000	A rap, a rap rap.
3250000	3251000	No, no, no, no.
3256000	3258000	Give the people what they want, dad.
3263000	3265000	My name's Osama bin Laden.
3271000	3273000	My name's Osama bin Laden.
3276000	3277000	Everybody!
3277000	3279000	One, two, three, four, come on.
3279000	3281000	My name's Osama bin Laden.
3281000	3282000	I don't eat salad.
3282000	3283000	I eat ramen.
3283000	3285000	I live in a cave.
3285000	3292000	I'm on the rave till you got me with your zero-dark-30-by-whisper in my name.
3292000	3295000	Toot toot, beep-beep, night vision.
3297000	3298000	You whispered my name.
3298000	3301000	I thought you were a little girl in trouble.
3301000	3304000	Walked into the doorway and got shot in the face.
3304000	3305000	I deserved it.
3305000	3306000	I deserved it.
3308000	3309000	I deserved it.
3310000	3312000	My name's Osama bin Laden.
3312000	3314000	My name is Osama.
3314000	3316000	I've come to see your pa.
3316000	3320000	He owes me $5 from when I've owed his law.
3322000	3326000	Last week, I have a funny hat.
3326000	3328000	My god is funny, too.
3328000	3335000	My name's Osama bin Laden.
3335000	3337000	Wait, can I explain what I meant?
3337000	3339000	My name's Osama bin Laden.
3340000	3341000	Too late.
3341000	3342000	Too late.
3343000	3344000	Listen, no.
3345000	3347000	I meant my version of it.
3348000	3350000	The extreme version.
3353000	3355000	My name is Osama.
3355000	3357000	I think it's hot in here.
3357000	3363000	I'm gonna go in my car and drive around and get a beer.
3363000	3364000	Can I have a beer?
3364000	3367000	No, that's illegal here.
3367000	3371000	Gonna park my car and get out and get a beer.
3371000	3372000	My name's Osama.
3372000	3375000	I live on your pier.
3375000	3378000	And your Lloyd Webber wrote this song.
3378000	3379000	I'm...
3387000	3394000	I didn't mean it.
3394000	3397000	I didn't mean the Islamic God was funny.
3397000	3401000	An Osama bin Laden Andrew Lloyd Webber collaboration.
3402000	3404000	I liked that in the end he was gonna...
3404000	3405000	Yeah, he was gonna...
3405000	3407000	I live on your pier.
3407000	3409000	I stopped it too soon, man.
3409000	3411000	Well, I don't know.
3411000	3412000	I don't think I had it in me.
3412000	3414000	We open in two nights, you guys.
3418000	3420000	Look, I mean, there's a lot of feelings around...
3420000	3422000	You came down pretty hard on Islam there, Dan.
3430000	3432000	That's a pretty bold stand to this day and end.
3432000	3434000	I said his God was funny.
3435000	3436000	I meant...
3436000	3442000	I meant a God that cares so much that he would ask you to hurt people.
3443000	3444000	Seems silly.
3445000	3446000	That made it worse?
3446000	3447000	What are you...
3447000	3448000	What?
3448000	3449000	Is it...
3449000	3452000	Drink your weird low-in-brow 40 ounce.
3455000	3458000	If you don't make eye contact with me, I can't see you.
3459000	3460000	He just...
3460000	3461000	That made it worse.
3466000	3467000	All right.
3467000	3468000	Shit rolls downhill.
3468000	3469000	Thank you for helping me.
3470000	3474000	So, anyways, Jewish Mom, Black Dad, tell me more.
3475000	3477000	What was Thanksgiving like at that house?
3478000	3480000	I think it went a little something.
3480000	3481000	Like this.
3481000	3482000	Hey...
3483000	3485000	Is this a jive turkey?
3487000	3488000	We'll be right back.
3488000	3489000	Oy vey!
3490000	3501000	You know, if that was actually how my thanksgivings were, I would actually have loved my thanksgivings.
3502000	3505000	Because guys from Trinidad always talk about jive turkeys, right?
3505000	3507000	They always talk about jive turkeys.
3508000	3509000	All right.
3509000	3511000	How do you know when a turkey is a jive turkey?
3515000	3516000	You have to look at the legs.
3516000	3517000	Oh, yeah.
3518000	3519000	All right.
3520000	3522000	We're gonna play this right this time.
3522000	3524000	Are you okay, Skyler?
3524000	3525000	I'm amazing.
3525000	3526000	Okay, great.
3526000	3528000	If you get uncomfortable, just let me know.
3529000	3532000	I know it's hot up here, and I don't know what I'm doing.
3532000	3533000	It's a bad show.
3534000	3535000	It's all right.
3535000	3536000	It's all right.
3536000	3537000	I don't want you to come away with that.
3537000	3539000	I won't stand for that.
3539000	3540000	It's an amazing show.
3540000	3541000	Oh, thank you, Skyler.
3541000	3542000	Thank you.
3542000	3543000	I wasn't fishing for that.
3543000	3546000	Yeah, but this guy watches Minecraft at home.
3548000	3549000	He's our barometer.
3550000	3551000	He says, what's entertaining?
3552000	3553000	Is that helpful?
3554000	3557000	If you knew what Hearthstone looked like...
3558000	3561000	Have you been to grassgrow.com?
3562000	3565000	You get to watch real-time grass-growing.
3566000	3568000	From paintdryers.org.
3569000	3571000	What exactly does Hearthstone look like?
3571000	3573000	Hearthstone just looks magical.
3573000	3576000	It looks like colored rectangles bumping into each other.
3576000	3579000	With explosions and animations and noises.
3579000	3581000	Yeah, it's got a lot of noises.
3581000	3582000	It's a card game.
3582000	3584000	Each card, it's a digital card game.
3584000	3585000	Gotcha.
3585000	3587000	People watch World Series of Poker.
3587000	3589000	Yeah, I mean, I don't get any of it.
3589000	3591000	Rectangles don't even bump into each other.
3592000	3594000	People watch Prairie Home Companion.
3594000	3595000	People watch this show.
3595000	3598000	People watch Community for Six Seasons.
3598000	3600000	Well, that's pretty cool.
3600000	3602000	People watch Community for Six Seasons.
3603000	3605000	Thank you, thank you.
3605000	3606000	Thank you.
3606000	3607000	Four and a half.
3607000	3608000	And an Emmy.
3608000	3610000	Don't forget, tell everybody...
3610000	3614000	Tell Yahoo I told everybody to say we deserve an Emmy.
3614000	3616000	Tell them Seth MacFarlane sent you.
3620000	3622000	Enter the code Seth MacFarlane.
3623000	3626000	Yeah, they had a campaign a while back that was like,
3626000	3629000	Hey, have you noticed Family Guy hasn't got an Emmy yet?
3629000	3631000	I actually got those screeners.
3631000	3634000	It was just like kind of passive aggressively saying to all the voters,
3634000	3637000	like, yeah, we make you laugh and you don't vote for us.
3637000	3639000	Sucker dicks watch this episode kind of thing.
3639000	3641000	And did they win one then?
3641000	3643000	I don't recall.
3643000	3647000	The most blatant one was when the Simpsons Family Guy crossover
3647000	3650000	where Homer's throwing Emmys at Peter and Peter goes,
3650000	3652000	Hey, no fair, we ain't got none of those.
3652000	3655000	So that was kind of the most blatant please vote for us.
3656000	3659000	I don't know how the Emmys work,
3659000	3662000	but I think it comes down to other writers having to like me,
3662000	3666000	which I think is like, there's no way that's ever going to happen.
3666000	3669000	Which Emmys do you think you'd be most likely to be nominated for?
3669000	3674000	Well, I always thought that maybe our actors would eventually get at least nominated.
3674000	3677000	I thought that, you know, a while ago that like Danny Pooty and...
3677000	3678000	There was never a nomination?
3678000	3680000	No, never, never.
3680000	3682000	I'm not better. I don't care.
3682000	3685000	I mean, you know, whatever. Everyone has an Emmy.
3685000	3688000	Do you think that the Emmy committee is a little like,
3688000	3692000	a little hesitant to nominate somebody who has come down so hard against Islam?
3699000	3702000	Because that seems justified. That seems justified.
3702000	3705000	I think having a funny God isn't coming down on the religion.
3705000	3707000	I think God should encompass all.
3707000	3709000	Scatter, don't coddle them. We know what he meant.
3710000	3713000	I appreciate it, Skyler.
3713000	3715000	I mean, I just want people to be happy.
3718000	3722000	If I were a God, I would...
3722000	3724000	Be a lot like Hitler.
3726000	3728000	But not in a bad way.
3728000	3730000	Right. The good parts of Hitler.
3730000	3731000	Yeah.
3731000	3733000	Was it clear what I was trying to say at that point?
3733000	3734000	No.
3735000	3738000	God and Hitler...
3740000	3743000	We all have that in common with Hitler.
3743000	3746000	Everything. The universe has that in common with Hitler.
3746000	3748000	Self-loathing?
3748000	3751000	Yes. Dissatisfaction with the status quo.
3751000	3755000	That there was nothing. The universe was nothingness.
3755000	3757000	And then it exploded into everythingness.
3757000	3760000	So that means that the nothingness, which must have been God,
3760000	3764000	otherwise if something pre-existed God, which nothingness would have,
3764000	3766000	then God wouldn't be God.
3766000	3770000	So nothingness must also be God, which means that God's origin must be nothing,
3770000	3773000	which means that God was dissatisfied with his own state.
3773000	3776000	And so he split up and expanded into everything.
3776000	3778000	He didn't like being nothing.
3778000	3783000	Just as Hitler didn't like just being the mayor of Berlin or whatever he started as.
3787000	3789000	He was never the mayor of Berlin.
3790000	3793000	Hitler was the mayor of Berlin.
3795000	3797000	Never should have... No one ever talked about that.
3797000	3800000	Why did they elect this guy mayor?
3800000	3804000	He was saying, like, if I'm mayor, I'll kill all the Jews.
3804000	3808000	And then everyone was like, well, I'm voting for him because he won't have that power as mayor.
3808000	3811000	But he stands on those potholes outside my house.
3811000	3814000	Like, he's the only guy keeping the trains running on time.
3814000	3816000	And then, okay.
3816000	3819000	They're probably like, I'm sure he's just misunderstood.
3819000	3821000	I mean, everybody's mad these days.
3821000	3823000	It's 1936.
3823000	3825000	Maybe he should be mayor.
3825000	3827000	When Margaret...
3827000	3829000	I was just going off about the Jews the other day.
3829000	3831000	Yes, you were. Yes, you are.
3831000	3833000	And we're Jewish.
3833000	3835000	He's got my vote.
3835000	3837000	Mayor of Berlin.
3837000	3839000	Lever.
3839000	3843000	They voted with slot machines in Germany.
3843000	3846000	I'm glad we took that time for you to clear that up for us, Dan.
3847000	3853000	Well, I think it's silly that you can't say that technically God and Hitler had that one thing in common.
3853000	3854000	I just don't know.
3854000	3859000	I mean, for me, I don't know if it was sufficiently clear that what you were talking about was self-loathing.
3859000	3863000	Well, self-loathing is, yeah, you hate what you are.
3863000	3864000	I mean, I get it now.
3864000	3867000	Yeah, now you get it.
3867000	3870000	I don't get the impression that Hitler hated who he was.
3870000	3875000	I think he hated what he felt had been done to him and his country.
3875000	3878000	Well, I'm thinking as opposed to being content.
3878000	3880000	He doesn't seem like a content guy.
3880000	3884000	No, I don't think contentment was a real thing after World War I.
3884000	3886000	I think that Germany was pretty bummed out about that.
3886000	3888000	It was called the Great Depression.
3888000	3890000	Hello!
3896000	3898000	That was gold.
3898000	3899000	I love it.
3899000	3902000	Sorry, it just presented itself. I had to grab it.
3902000	3906000	Darsan?
3906000	3909000	Just don't say Darsan.
3909000	3911000	Darsan. Mom's Jewish?
3911000	3912000	Yes.
3912000	3913000	Does that make you officially Jewish?
3913000	3915000	It does. I'm a black Jew.
3915000	3917000	Are you practicing? Do you go to temple and whatnot?
3917000	3922000	I did it until my bar mitzvah and I cashed out and I was like, okay, I'm good.
3922000	3925000	That's pretty Jewish.
3925000	3932000	Is that basically where your typical secular Jew gets to the bar mitzvah?
3932000	3934000	Because that's like a Christian confirmation, right?
3934000	3941000	When you're a kid, you're raised in the faith and it culminates in the bar mitzvah
3941000	3943000	and then you can't as you say cash out.
3943000	3948000	I was more raised for reform where it was basically my parents and I decided that temple was really boring.
3948000	3951000	We didn't go, but they sent me to Jewish camp,
3951000	3955000	which I learned all my dirty humor because I was the only black person there.
3955000	3959000	So it came back and then the bar mitzvah still seemed like a good idea.
3959000	3962000	Do you have a good Jewish joke for us from Jewish camp?
3962000	3964000	God, I've used them so many times.
3964000	3966000	I didn't quite make that connection.
3966000	3970000	Because you were the only black kid at Jewish camp, they all told you their dirty jokes.
3970000	3974000	It's basically, for a lot of them, I was the first black person they'd ever met
3974000	3976000	because most of them went to Jewish school.
3976000	3978000	So they're trying to see what they could get away with
3978000	3982000	and I was so willing to push the envelope that they got away with everything.
3982000	3989000	Like they were coming up to you and saying, hey, did you hear the one about the black guy and the rabbi?
3989000	3993000	Can you give me an example of something really specific you remember?
3993000	3996000	There are a lot of back of the oven comments.
3996000	3998000	Jesus!
3998000	4000000	Jesus!
4000000	4002000	Get to the back of the oven?
4002000	4012000	That came out of the grassy knoll.
4012000	4017000	I've been picturing these sixth grade kids like, oh, what does your hair feel like?
4017000	4019000	And they're like, what?
4019000	4028000	Also, let's hit playback if you're listening to this, to the laughter to outrage ratio.
4028000	4031000	It's because Jewish women are famous for their cooking?
4031000	4032000	No.
4032000	4033000	Okay.
4033000	4036000	Well, okay, here's the best example.
4036000	4038000	I want a hundred of these.
4038000	4044000	So I was talking with my counselor and he was asking me about the origin of my parents, like how they met.
4044000	4047000	He was like, oh, so who's black?
4047000	4048000	Your mom or your dad?
4048000	4049000	Because I'm mixed.
4049000	4050000	And I said, oh, my mom's white.
4050000	4051000	She's from Utah originally.
4051000	4052000	My dad's black.
4052000	4053000	He's from Trinidad.
4053000	4056000	And he was asking more and he said, oh, so how did they meet?
4056000	4057000	And I said, oh, they had a mutual friend.
4057000	4058000	They met at a restaurant.
4058000	4062000	And he goes, oh, was your dad cleaning up?
4062000	4069000	Now, do you think that was he?
4069000	4073000	Was he in your memory?
4073000	4076000	Do you think that that kid, your memory may be wrong and may be right.
4076000	4081000	But do you do you remember that as the kid was knew what he was doing?
4081000	4090000	Or do you think he was being naive or was he really trying to shiv you?
4090000	4091000	Was he being diabolical?
4091000	4095000	Because it doesn't seem like kids are even smart enough to be that viable.
4095000	4096000	Well, first off, that wasn't a kid.
4096000	4097000	That was my counselor.
4097000	4099000	So he had a few years on me.
4099000	4101000	So he knew much more about the world than I did.
4101000	4102000	I missed that part.
4102000	4103000	He was trying to be funny, though, right?
4103000	4104000	Yeah.
4104000	4105000	And it was because I was crying.
4105000	4106000	I was laughing so hard.
4106000	4110000	And meanwhile, all the other staff who hurt were just kind of standing there.
4110000	4112000	He was being like Don Rickles.
4112000	4117000	He was just laying it on you hard, which shows a level of respect to deal it out that hard.
4117000	4121000	Let's not give this guy too much of a pass.
4121000	4126000	I think it shows a level of respect for him to not let it push his button.
4126000	4129000	But he could be a better camp counselor than that.
4129000	4131000	I honestly think racism is hilarious.
4131000	4134000	Well, you're allowed to.
4134000	4136000	You have to and are allowed to.
4137000	4141000	We could use a few less people thinking it's that hilarious that they would sell that joke
4141000	4146000	to a kid like, you know, we could condemn this guy and get away with it.
4146000	4149000	He's a shitty guy.
4149000	4151000	Bad, bad, bad, bad move.
4151000	4153000	Bad humor move.
4153000	4154000	I love bad humor.
4154000	4156000	So that's pretty funny.
4156000	4157000	All right.
4157000	4158000	Thank you.
4158000	4159000	Yeah.
4159000	4160000	Do you have any other jokes?
4160000	4163000	Like because there's certain like I don't like racial jokes and I don't like jokes where
4163000	4164000	people lose.
4164000	4168000	I don't like like I was at a bar a few days ago and everyone at the end of the bar was
4168000	4170000	telling like gross like the pedophile jokes.
4170000	4171000	They're usually not funny.
4171000	4176000	They just it's kind of just gross like humor when somebody loses is usually a bummer.
4176000	4177000	However, there are a rare instance.
4177000	4178000	What do you mean by that?
4178000	4180000	You mean you mean you mean what do you mean by that?
4180000	4182000	What were the the butt of the joke?
4182000	4183000	Because that guy's black.
4183000	4184000	He's an idiot.
4184000	4187000	Or because that guy's Polish or because she's a woman or she's blonde or whatever.
4187000	4193000	Like those are like you got you got you got two claps from.
4193000	4194000	That's right.
4194000	4197000	That was from low and brown guy is from a black Polish woman.
4197000	4203000	I think I think Groucho Marx Groucho the great Groucho Marx was always approached because
4203000	4205000	he was a famous funny person throughout his life.
4205000	4209000	He was always approached by people by course assholes at a restaurant or a bar on the street
4209000	4210000	and say oh I'm a funny guy too.
4210000	4211000	You'll love this one.
4211000	4215000	Two Jews and a black guy go in and he would always stop him and say take the ethnicity
4215000	4217000	out of it because it's a funny joke.
4217000	4218000	It doesn't need it.
4218000	4219000	Just say three guys.
4219000	4223000	If the joke needs the race it's not funny.
4223000	4227000	Like try the joke with just two guys or a guy or a girl.
4227000	4230000	Like if it's a funny joke doesn't need it.
4230000	4235000	But I've known like loads of like old school Jewish comics and they'll tell you some old
4235000	4239000	Jewish jokes which are fucking funny but it has to be an old Jew telling you the joke.
4239000	4240000	Well I think that yeah I mean.
4240000	4243000	That kind of gives like the stamp of approval in a way.
4243000	4244000	I think I think it's like.
4244000	4247000	Like just but it has to be Jewish other than she's just like oh that's a fucking asshole.
4247000	4252000	It comes from a place of just like of silliness and not about like from the outside.
4252000	4256000	The great Sam Simon he just passed away he told me a bunch of jokes.
4256000	4261000	One I love he goes a black guy we're talking about the racism in jokes or race in jokes
4261000	4262000	and he goes here's one.
4262000	4268000	He goes a black guy Irish guy Jewish guy go into a bar and the black guy says to the bartender
4268000	4271000	bartender I'm hot I'm tired I'm thirsty I got to have a kuvazie.
4271000	4273000	The bartender gives him a kuvazie he drinks it down.
4273000	4276000	The Irish guy goes to the bartender says bartender I'm hot I'm tired I'm thirsty.
4276000	4277000	I've got to have a Guinness.
4277000	4279000	The bartender gives him a Guinness he drinks it down.
4279000	4282000	The Jewish guy says bartender I'm hot I'm tired I'm thirsty.
4282000	4284000	I got to have diabetes.
4286000	4288000	Yeah see that's I mean.
4291000	4297000	Yeah that one's on the bubble because the punchline doesn't does it isn't anti-Semitic.
4297000	4304000	The punchline is like is there's a Jewish guy telling you the joke and it's kind of like the flavor of of Jewish culture like comedy.
4305000	4315000	The problem is that in order to tell it you have to have two other races set it up and the black guy has to order a kuvazie and then just be forgotten for the rest of his life.
4315000	4320000	That guy was just born into this fictional world and he's like what's my job and God's like order a kuvazie.
4321000	4324000	Oh yeah and I couldn't be Irish.
4324000	4326000	No you couldn't trust me just don't worry about it.
4326000	4328000	Fuck you know like I like.
4328000	4329000	I want to hear you.
4329000	4330000	I want to hear you.
4330000	4331000	We tell that joke.
4331000	4332000	I know your gift for.
4333000	4334000	Do it.
4336000	4344000	All right a black guy and Irish guy and a Jewish guy go into a bar and the bartender says what can I get you.
4345000	4348000	And the black guy says bartender I'm hot.
4348000	4350000	I'm thirsty.
4354000	4356000	There was a third tired tired.
4356000	4358000	I'm hot and tired I'm thirsty.
4358000	4361000	I got to have a kuvazie.
4363000	4367000	And the bartender says OK.
4367000	4371000	Gives him one and the Irish guy says bartender I'm hot.
4371000	4372000	I'm tired.
4372000	4373000	I'm thirsty.
4374000	4378000	I've got to have my Baileys Irish cream.
4380000	4381000	Give him one.
4381000	4384000	And the Jewish guy says bartender I'm hot.
4384000	4385000	I'm tired.
4385000	4386000	I'm thirsty.
4386000	4387000	I got to have diabetes.
4388000	4389000	I got it.
4389000	4390000	I didn't want to.
4390000	4391000	I didn't want to.
4391000	4393000	I didn't want to break the tape at the finish line.
4393000	4394000	I crawled under it.
4394000	4395000	We were at a bar.
4395000	4396000	Shouldn't be in this race.
4396000	4401000	If you know Jay Johnston from Mr. Show and Sarah Silverman program who's hilarious.
4401000	4406000	We were out with Jerry Miner and Brandon Johnson who are two awesome friends of ours in black comics.
4406000	4409000	And Jay was doing race jokes just to just to piss them off.
4409000	4412000	And they're like just like just glowering at him.
4412000	4415000	Who who was Jerry Miner and Brandon.
4415000	4418000	And they were just giving him like just rustic in this is years ago.
4418000	4420000	And they're like I don't think that's funny man.
4420000	4422000	Like you're not making me laugh.
4422000	4423000	Like why are you telling these jokes?
4423000	4427000	And I said like I don't I don't I don't really think that race jokes are funny.
4427000	4430000	However there's one joke I think it's only funny if the guy is black.
4430000	4434000	And Jerry and Brandon just gave me a look like all right go tell me the joke.
4434000	4437000	And I said I think this joke is only funny if the guy's a black guy.
4437000	4439000	So the black guy is walking around the Cadillac dealership.
4439000	4442000	And he's looking at the cars and a guy that works there comes out and says excuse me.
4442000	4445000	Excuse me sir are you are you thinking about buying a Cadillac?
4445000	4447000	And the guy says no I know I'm buying a Cadillac.
4447000	4453000	I'm thinking about Pussy.
4453000	4454000	Right Darcet?
4454000	4457000	I fucking love it.
4457000	4458000	Fucking loves it.
4458000	4462000	Here he'll laugh at anything.
4462000	4463000	You may think about race jokes.
4463000	4468000	Your atonement will be with the public when the when the free podcast drops.
4469000	4470000	Do you hear Mr. Davis?
4470000	4474000	It has to be like if it's not like something like openly discriminating like it just like
4474000	4478000	it's like circumstantial like it is funny that like it like that joke worked because
4478000	4482000	Yeah because he's going to get a car and he's going to get laid later on.
4482000	4485000	I don't think he's that high status.
4485000	4486000	I don't think he's that high status.
4486000	4491000	I think the joke is that it plays into a stereotype that he's like he's a black guy
4491000	4493000	and he's going to get a Cadillac because he thinks he's going to get him laid.
4493000	4496000	It's kind of like looking down at him as a consumer.
4497000	4503000	Like he's it's a stereotype you know it's like it's it's like you walk away from that joke
4503000	4508000	you laugh at it and then you go yeah those black people they love they love Cadillacs
4508000	4511000	because they think it gets some pussy and it's like you shouldn't be thinking that
4511000	4514000	walking away from a joke you should be thinking I love humanity.
4514000	4516000	That's that was your point.
4516000	4520000	You didn't like it when people lose but there's a you're hearing you're having a stereotype
4520000	4523000	reinforced the the the Jewish guy saying I got it.
4523000	4526000	It's got to I got to have diabetes again.
4526000	4528000	Like I said it's on the bubble.
4528000	4529000	I don't know.
4529000	4533000	I walk away from that joke thinking how it parody the stereotype also let me know that
4533000	4536000	that is a stereotype and know not to believe it necessarily.
4537000	4538000	Yeah.
4538000	4541000	But you you may have been just taught about it by the joke.
4541000	4544000	Like where do we where do we even know about that stuff if it wasn't from jokes.
4544000	4545000	I don't know.
4545000	4549000	Is that it's not like it's it's like it's an important debate because it's not the one
4549000	4553000	I've learned in the later years of my life is that we've got to stop thinking about it
4553000	4557000	because I was I was used to think like because I was a big freedom of speech guy said no
4557000	4561000	matter what I'd be like what are we going to like it's not about making anything illegal
4561000	4564000	it's not about taking any rights away like you can still have a separate conversation
4564000	4569000	about what is what is culturally beneficial and what's what what makes people happy
4569000	4576000	and what what elevates you as a person and stuff and so but it doesn't what do I care
4576000	4577000	I don't care.
4577000	4578000	I don't care.
4578000	4579000	I don't care.
4579000	4580000	I'm white.
4581000	4583000	I'm going home to play Witcher 3.
4583000	4585000	How about that stereotype.
4585000	4586000	Do you like it.
4586000	4587000	Yeah I'm white.
4589000	4590000	Love Witcher 3.
4590000	4595000	I'm half white so I can you can like understand like the first three levels.
4599000	4600000	I like it.
4600000	4601000	I like it a lot.
4601000	4602000	It's like it's like Skyrim.
4602000	4606000	It's like a bigger better Skyrim but I fucked up.
4606000	4612000	I got it on Xbox and the load screens are really long and I had I already bought a really
4612000	4616000	expensive gaming PC and I could have just downloaded it on Steam and played it.
4616000	4620000	I've already done this and it works and I didn't fucking get it on Steam and I'm very
4620000	4621000	upset with myself.
4622000	4623000	It's not important.
4623000	4626000	Spencer can I find out when you when you're going to be playing Minecraft or whatever
4626000	4630000	and can I come twitch and like like hurl abuse at you or tell you what color to paint things.
4630000	4631000	You could come.
4632000	4633000	I don't.
4633000	4634000	I won't stop you.
4634000	4636000	I just I don't have a good schedule.
4636000	4637000	I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
4637000	4639000	I'm just like I want to play video games.
4639000	4642000	I'm like I'm going to play video games in five minutes.
4642000	4643000	How do people tell you.
4643000	4644000	I don't think it's the way to do it.
4644000	4645000	I saw you tweet that once.
4645000	4646000	How do people.
4646000	4649000	Is that the usual way for people to know that you're going to do it.
4650000	4651000	I guess I can.
4651000	4652000	I can technically answer that.
4652000	4653000	Like if so.
4653000	4654000	Yeah.
4654000	4655000	I think he can answer that.
4655000	4656000	You set a schedule.
4656000	4658000	So you're like I don't I'm a I'm a Minecraft guy.
4658000	4660000	I'm Minecraft every Monday at 7 p.m.
4660000	4662000	So everyone knows to come on Monday at 7 p.m.
4662000	4663000	I watch me Minecraft.
4664000	4669000	Do you ever do you ever do like proper dungeon mastering like D&D stuff like with groups anymore.
4669000	4673000	No I mean it's a lot a lot a lot of work.
4673000	4675000	Also don't go outside much.
4676000	4678000	So not a joke.
4680000	4683000	But yeah no it's just you don't you don't miss doing that.
4683000	4684000	It's not a thing that you will.
4684000	4686000	I don't have people that I really play with.
4686000	4688000	But I mean it's like yeah.
4688000	4691000	I mean it's it's it's I do Shadowrun.
4692000	4694000	It scratches that itch.
4694000	4696000	I'm doing I'm making things happen.
4696000	4697000	I don't know man.
4698000	4702000	No I'm not playing Dungeons and Dragons behind your guys's back.
4703000	4704000	Thanks.
4704000	4705000	All right.
4705000	4706000	So cops are bad.
4706000	4708000	Islam's bad.
4708000	4709000	White people are bad.
4709000	4711000	Black people are bad.
4712000	4713000	Irish and Jews.
4713000	4714000	Give me a break.
4715000	4717000	Which are three's load screens.
4717000	4718000	Out in three categories.
4720000	4722000	Jewish camp sounds pretty bad.
4724000	4726000	I hope you get that way.
4728000	4730000	What else is bad.
4730000	4732000	Like the fucking global warming's bad.
4732000	4734000	I'm sweating like a pig heat.
4734000	4736000	What's what the heat's bad.
4736000	4740000	I mean like all this hair I have like a puddle of sweat I have to wring out later.
4742000	4745000	What ever note and the Apple Watch.
4745000	4747000	I got I ran out of faces.
4747000	4748000	Everything's bad.
4748000	4749000	Twitter's bad.
4749000	4751000	I got my Twitter systems bad.
4751000	4752000	All you guys are great that we're.
4753000	4754000	Oh don't forget.
4754000	4755000	Oh shit.
4755000	4756000	Thank you Steve.
4756000	4757000	Steve just text her.
4757000	4766000	We're going to be at Comic Con in San Diego on the 12th July 12th July 12th.
4766000	4768000	But not at Comic Con.
4768000	4770000	Like you don't have to have a badge.
4770000	4772000	Like we're just going to be in the gas lamp district which is.
4772000	4776000	So if you're at Comic Con I would say you're probably going to leave Sunday right.
4776000	4782000	But stay a little bit because we're going to do a show Sunday night at the tin roof in the gas lamp.
4782000	4784000	And I'll keep tweeting the link to buy tickets.
4784000	4787000	But I'm a little a little panicked.
4787000	4791000	Like I because I figure Sunday nights the night everybody leaves Sunday.
4792000	4799000	But so I'm hoping that there's a way we can keep spreading awareness and maybe Armenians that are there for Comic Con.
4799000	4806000	And people that are already in San Diego just be there because the place seats like 500 people or holds 500 people.
4806000	4808000	And so what do you know.
4808000	4811000	Let's let's cook up something special for him and throw a party.
4811000	4812000	Well yeah we're going to.
4812000	4816000	I know we're going to have like signable stuff for Rick and Morty to give away.
4817000	4824000	I mean I don't know if that's enough but I was thinking like also if you're in costume maybe we could do some kind of costume thing and have like prizes for that.
4824000	4830000	But I'm not to eclipse the whole show with that but just like somebody shows up dressed like a robot.
4830000	4832000	We should totally we should larp.
4833000	4834000	That would be amazing.
4834000	4835000	I could help you with that.
4835000	4836000	Oh yeah.
4836000	4837000	Are you a larper.
4837000	4838000	Very much so.
4838000	4839000	Oh yeah.
4839000	4840000	What do you what do you what do you play.
4840000	4841000	What are you doing.
4841000	4843000	I do a lot of different ones but the one I play currently is a post apocalyptic zombie.
4844000	4845000	No shit.
4845000	4847000	Well so is that like with paint balls.
4847000	4848000	No we use Nerf.
4848000	4850000	Nerf like Nerf guns.
4850000	4851000	Nerf guns.
4851000	4852000	Yeah.
4852000	4853000	And then we also use foam swords.
4853000	4857000	Is it larping if you're just shooting Nerf weapons at each other.
4857000	4859000	Well it's like just playing a game at night.
4859000	4862000	We're not allowed to fire our Nerf weapons because our darts get lost.
4862000	4864000	So we have to throw bird seed packets.
4864000	4865000	It doesn't really.
4865000	4866000	That's the zombies.
4868000	4869000	So is it.
4869000	4872000	Do you do you pretend you're a sorceress at that point against the zombies.
4872000	4874000	Some people yell bang.
4874000	4876000	I'm not one of those people.
4877000	4878000	I don't use a sword though.
4878000	4879000	Can we go.
4879000	4880000	I want to.
4880000	4881000	I've never met a lerper.
4881000	4882000	I don't.
4882000	4883000	Well I probably have but I've never.
4883000	4885000	I've never met an openly lerping lerper.
4885000	4887000	It is a rare thing.
4887000	4889000	We are the bottom tier.
4889000	4891000	Furries are right underneath.
4892000	4893000	Literally.
4893000	4894000	Sometimes right on top.
4894000	4898000	I don't know what larping is but I think I know everything I need to know about it now.
4898000	4900000	But I'm just curious about the.
4900000	4906000	So you guys go out into a clearing in the woods and then some people are saying they're like.
4906000	4912000	So for this specific one I'm just going to stick to this one.
4912000	4914000	We all head out for a weekend.
4914000	4918000	It's a three day event at nine p.m. on Friday.
4918000	4921000	We go game on and everyone is in character.
4921000	4926000	The storytellers will release mobs of 20 to 30 people dressed as zombies to come and attack us.
4926000	4929000	We will murder those things and take their things.
4929000	4933000	And then our system is a hit points based system and armor based system.
4933000	4936000	So when you swing your weapon you yell how much damage you do.
4936000	4937000	And then the person gets hit by it.
4937000	4940000	They have to calculate their life and then they fall down if their life goes away.
4940000	4944000	So when you swing your weapon you tell them how much damage you're doing.
4944000	4945000	Yes.
4945000	4947000	So you're like two two two.
4947000	4949000	Oh it's not random.
4949000	4953000	You know what your weapon is and you know how skilled you are.
4953000	4955000	Basically you have to memorize.
4955000	4957000	No that works.
4957000	4962000	So like if it was your first night you would yell too.
4962000	4964000	Guns start at three.
4964000	4966000	Guns start at three.
4966000	4972000	Yeah so your first night you'd be swinging twos or swinging threes if you got a two hander.
4972000	4976000	I mean if yeah there's upgraded weapons.
4976000	4978000	Do we have another Larpa over there?
4978000	4980000	Oh an extra hand.
4980000	4982000	He just loves golf clubs.
4982000	4983000	Extra hands.
4983000	4984000	Oh four.
4984000	4986000	Oh he's making golf jokes.
4986000	4989000	But I did not get that at all.
4989000	4990000	I did not get that at all.
4990000	4993000	His golf club deals of fours.
4993000	4994000	All right.
4994000	4995000	Everybody cool it.
4995000	4996000	That's funny.
4996000	4998000	So would it be funny if he was a black guy?
4998000	5002000	So then there are also powers.
5002000	5008000	So those people with like psionic abilities that throw packets that make your brain melt and see zombies get powers.
5008000	5010000	Yes very much so.
5010000	5012000	Can they spit acid?
5012000	5014000	There are zombies that vomit acid.
5014000	5015000	Good.
5015000	5016000	Yes.
5016000	5017000	Okay sorry.
5017000	5019000	There are also zombies that like punch really hard.
5019000	5020000	Not interested.
5020000	5021000	Okay.
5021000	5023000	Just acid acid vomit.
5023000	5024000	Sign me up.
5024000	5025000	Yep.
5025000	5026000	Especially acid vomit.
5026000	5028000	Are you down for Larping or not down for Larping?
5028000	5032000	Can you actually vomit like is it okay like like real vomit?
5032000	5038000	In really intense scenes I have seen like play vomit like putting stuff in their mouth and then squirting it out of their mouth at people.
5038000	5039000	Okay.
5039000	5040000	We call those splatter mods.
5040000	5044000	But he doesn't have to be play vomit right?
5044000	5045000	All right.
5045000	5046000	I think.
5046000	5049000	I want to vomit on people.
5049000	5053000	I think there's a special I think there's a special other thing you could do other than Larping.
5053000	5056000	Is that just called vomiting on people?
5056000	5058000	It's called going to Japan.
5058000	5060000	Yeah they have a room for that.
5060000	5067000	Was that is that a reference to the first George Bush the because he puked at that summit in Tokyo.
5067000	5068000	Deep cousin.
5068000	5073000	It's like a 35 year old I thought that was like a 35 year old joke.
5073000	5076000	It's like vomit Japan.
5076000	5077000	Yeah.
5077000	5078000	All right.
5078000	5079000	No I have questions.
5079000	5080000	Go.
5080000	5081000	So so psionic abilities.
5081000	5082000	Yes.
5082000	5083000	Spell abilities.
5083000	5084000	Yes.
5084000	5086000	They're all birdseed based like a majority of them.
5086000	5087000	Yes.
5087000	5088000	Some of them are touch.
5088000	5091000	So how did you land on picking birdseed packets.
5091000	5099000	Because if they get lost in the woods they'd biodegrade into birdseed or they turn into plants.
5099000	5100000	That's great.
5100000	5103000	You should you should put tree seeds in there.
5103000	5106000	I hope that they would turn into more forest.
5106000	5109000	Birdseed is plant seeds.
5109000	5110000	It doesn't grow birds.
5110000	5111000	Oh yeah.
5111000	5112000	Yeah.
5112000	5113000	Yeah.
5113000	5114000	You're right.
5114000	5115000	You're right.
5115000	5118000	What do you think birdseeds were.
5118000	5121000	You know what.
5121000	5124000	Fucking.
5124000	5127000	I also don't know where pasta comes from.
5128000	5130000	Is there like a pasta plant.
5130000	5132000	Hitler was the mayor of Berlin.
5132000	5133000	I don't know.
5133000	5134000	I.
5134000	5135000	Yeah.
5135000	5136000	Sunflower seeds are.
5136000	5137000	Okay.
5137000	5139000	Stay in college everybody.
5139000	5140000	Yeah.
5140000	5141000	You're right.
5141000	5144000	Birdseed is just regular old seeds.
5144000	5146000	But we call them birdseed.
5146000	5151000	It's not like there's a tree that grows birdseed.
5151000	5153000	Other birds love it.
5153000	5154000	Oh.
5154000	5156000	We found a birdseed tree.
5156000	5157000	It was in high school.
5157000	5160000	We toilet paper at this girl's house and for no reason we were just being assholes.
5160000	5164000	And we sprinkled birdseed all over her roof because she and her family were out of town.
5164000	5169000	And so we put birdseeds all over the roof but it's California so it doesn't rain for another three months.
5169000	5172000	So in the wooden shingles there's just this dormant birdseeds laying there.
5172000	5177000	So three months later all of a sudden their house is a giant chia pet.
5177000	5178000	That's amazing.
5178000	5179000	Yeah.
5179000	5180000	But why birdseed?
5180000	5185000	Because it's you can buy it at a pet food store you can get a giant sack of birdseed and it sprouts into grasses and plants.
5185000	5186000	Wait.
5186000	5189000	Was that your intention or was your prank to make birds come out?
5189000	5190000	No.
5190000	5192000	Our intention was to make their shingles grow plants.
5192000	5193000	Oh and it really worked.
5193000	5194000	Yeah.
5194000	5197000	And what's the harm of that?
5197000	5200000	Their house looks like the Shire.
5200000	5201000	I don't know.
5201000	5203000	It looks like Bilbo Baggins.
5203000	5204000	Why don't we all do that?
5204000	5206000	Why don't we put birdseed on our roof?
5206000	5209000	They have little tiny roots.
5209000	5211000	They'll probably cut into the ceiling.
5211000	5213000	It's really tough stuff but it could.
5213000	5215000	Isn't she a cave-in?
5215000	5221000	This guy knows his birdseed, Dan.
5221000	5223000	It's been a terrible episode and I...
5223000	5225000	That is not true.
5225000	5226000	It's fine.
5226000	5228000	I don't care.
5228000	5234000	I don't care.
5234000	5235000	We should...
5235000	5237000	The heat's really gotten to you hasn't it?
5237000	5238000	I have this.
5238000	5244000	Tonight, I can't figure out how to deal with this thing with Erin where she keeps...
5244000	5245000	We keep getting in fights about it.
5245000	5248000	We're not going to get in fights about it anymore though because my shame button is
5248000	5250000	going to get pushed and I'm not going to breathe.
5250000	5254000	I knew the fight was going to be about your shame button.
5254000	5258000	But she won't fucking stop bringing up the fact that at this point at the end of the
5258000	5263000	show when I go like, oh we should get a girl up here before we play the game and Erin
5264000	5268000	keeps saying, boy, I look forward to a day when we don't have to say that.
5268000	5273000	And I'm like, motherfucker, it's half the species and it's not like...
5273000	5277000	I mean, you could technically just say, could we get someone up here and then pick a girl
5277000	5278000	and not say it.
5278000	5280000	Well, but that's not...
5280000	5281000	That's dishonest though.
5281000	5282000	Yeah, but who can...
5282000	5285000	What the fuck distinction is that?
5285000	5288000	How is that progress that I'm keeping something to myself?
5288000	5292000	I'd say the simplest way to look at that is that the show tends to be six guys on stage.
5292000	5295000	Adding femininity to the show is never a bad idea.
5295000	5300000	I don't know how to prove her wrong.
5300000	5302000	Do I just keep...
5302000	5304000	Because I can't not...
5304000	5306000	I mean, I guess you're right, Skyler.
5306000	5311000	I guess I just have to own all of this fucking my own garbage, I guess.
5311000	5314000	The whole point is really to make it...
5314000	5317000	Equality is just another thing, not a big deal.
5317000	5320000	So by doing that, it's just another thing.
5320000	5321000	Just another thing.
5321000	5324000	But where is the bottleneck of the no big deal?
5324000	5327000	Is it in my own brain, like Skyler's saying, where I just go,
5327000	5329000	hey, who wants to come up and everyone raises their hand?
5329000	5332000	And then meanwhile in my head, secret terminator is...
5332000	5337000	Disqualified penis, disqualified penis, boobies get up.
5337000	5342000	Or is it more honest or less honest for me to say...
5342000	5344000	What is Aaron's beef about it?
5344000	5352000	That it feels like women are some kind of subhuman.
5352000	5355000	Well, it's not like you're saying, oh, we need to get a subhuman up here.
5355000	5357000	That it's a quota or something.
5357000	5359000	But it is a quota because there's not many women up.
5359000	5363000	Yeah, or women are just people that get to be excluded because of that.
5363000	5365000	And then she'll bring up...
5365000	5368000	And then she'll say, well, yeah, but you don't have a quota.
5368000	5372000	You never say, let's bring such and such racial group up, to which I say,
5372000	5374000	but race is an artificial construct.
5374000	5375000	There's no...
5375000	5378000	I also don't say, let's bring a red-haired person up.
5378000	5386000	But there's a biological distinction and women are not up here all night.
5386000	5388000	I don't know.
5388000	5391000	I'm 42. I can only get so fucking progressive.
5391000	5395000	My 30-year-old wife is revealing to me that I'm Archie Bunker.
5395000	5397000	Still, still, I'm Archie Bunker.
5397000	5406000	I agree that bringing up a female to play Aaron's character is a progressive thing.
5406000	5407000	Because it's good.
5407000	5410000	I think I phrased that really badly.
5410000	5412000	Because it's good, it's progressive, it's your logic.
5412000	5414000	I think so, yeah.
5414000	5418000	I'm really bad at this, so I'm just going to try to say it.
5418000	5422000	Are we bringing somebody else up to play Shadowrun for 12 minutes?
5422000	5423000	Yes.
5423000	5426000	Then we get to pick whether we bring up a male or a female person.
5426000	5429000	Should we flip a coin?
5429000	5434000	Why don't we bring up a female but not for Aaron's character specifically?
5434000	5439000	We could just always get females for all of the Shadowrun and then females.
5439000	5441000	Just so you know, I don't think that's her beef.
5441000	5444000	It does nothing to do with whether you're playing her character.
5444000	5446000	It's voicing it. That's the issue.
5446000	5451000	I think we need more females, so even if it is awkward asking for them,
5451000	5453000	I think it's a bullet we should take.
5453000	5455000	Would a woman like to play any character in Shadowrun right now?
5455000	5457000	After all of that horrible bullshit?
5457000	5458000	Thank you.
5458000	5461000	See, no women are even volunteering themselves right now.
5461000	5463000	We got one. We have one brave soul there.
5463000	5464000	Awesome.
5464000	5465000	What's your name, man?
5465000	5466000	Awesome.
5466000	5468000	She'll take that government cheese.
5468000	5469000	Yeah.
5470000	5471000	What's your name?
5471000	5472000	Heather.
5475000	5476000	Isn't she the seamstress?
5476000	5479000	Heather had the thread that sewed the button on the jacket.
5479000	5480000	Oh, okay.
5480000	5481000	The Jack War.
5482000	5483000	Hello, Heather.
5483000	5484000	Hello.
5485000	5486000	I like your serious sucker shirt.
5486000	5487000	Oh, yeah. Thank you.
5488000	5489000	It's just from Target.
5489000	5490000	I dig it.
5490000	5493000	By the way, I wasn't stopping the show because it was an actual problem.
5493000	5496000	I was stopping the show because I thought that it's a conversation point
5496000	5499000	that I'm confused about that needs to be addressed.
5499000	5500000	It doesn't need to be solved.
5500000	5502000	There's just something interesting to talk about.
5502000	5505000	I think there could be more women in our show earlier and more often
5505000	5508000	than just bringing one on at the end of our show.
5508000	5510000	Let's not get carried away.
5511000	5514000	We'll see where this goes.
5514000	5517000	I can see where she's coming from in the sense that it seems tacked on
5517000	5520000	to say, oh, it's been all 17 guys up on stage.
5520000	5522000	Let's bring a woman up for 10 seconds.
5522000	5524000	She says three lines of dialogue and shadow.
5524000	5528000	Yeah, it's a big shame when you have to go out of your way
5528000	5532000	to proactively homogenize and stuff.
5532000	5539000	But also, until writing staffs were told that they had to,
5539000	5543000	you have to be proactive about shit and then the system changes.
5543000	5547000	The show, when there's half women out there in the audience,
5547000	5555000	which there aren't, a woman will take Spencer's place.
5555000	5558000	Spencer will take my place.
5558000	5560000	I'll go over where Jeff's sitting.
5560000	5564000	Jeff will drive the women to and from the show.
5564000	5567000	I'll sign up for that.
5567000	5570000	From the show, from the show.
5570000	5574000	All right, so you don't have to say Mercy O'Donnell, Heather.
5574000	5575000	Who would you like to play?
5575000	5577000	If you could pick any of these other characters,
5577000	5579000	because you could play any one, you could play Dr. Friend.
5579000	5580000	I'd like to play Dr. Friend.
5580000	5583000	All right, Heather is going to play Dr. Friend.
5583000	5586000	Skylar, I get to pick.
5586000	5589000	Yeah, from the remaining ones.
5589000	5590000	I really do love Mercy.
5590000	5592000	I think she's a fantastic character.
5592000	5593000	The show is so progressive.
5593000	5595000	Skylar is Mercy.
5595000	5598000	I guess, Darsan, does that leave you hortiguard, maybe?
5598000	5599000	That's racist.
5599000	5602000	That's racist?
5602000	5604000	I'm trying to get one thing right.
5604000	5606000	I'm still new to this.
5606000	5610000	Black guy's always going to play the German psychic.
5610000	5611000	How about this?
5611000	5614000	I'll play hortiguard, and you play Eve Libertine, Darsan.
5614000	5615000	How about that?
5615000	5616000	I'm just going to go with it.
5616000	5617000	I have no idea what's going on.
5617000	5618000	OK.
5618000	5621000	You guys want to hear a joke that I think is actually only funny
5621000	5623000	if it's a black guy in the year 2075?
5623000	5624000	Yes.
5624000	5627000	A black guy goes to a cybernetic upgrade shop,
5627000	5629000	and the guy comes out and says,
5629000	5632000	excuse me, sir, are you looking for a psionic chip
5632000	5636000	to help focus your latent psychic powers
5636000	5640000	that were awakened in the Great Awakening of 2054?
5640000	5648000	And the black guy says, well, no, I'm thinking about pussy.
5648000	5650000	Still funny, even in the future.
5650000	5653000	And then he hovers away.
5653000	5654000	Progressive.
5654000	5657000	Can I plug my larp?
5657000	5658000	Can I plug my larp?
5658000	5659000	Oh, yeah.
5659000	5662000	Plug your larp, dude.
5662000	5663000	Skylar.
5663000	5664000	Well, I realized I just said a bunch of stuff about it,
5664000	5667000	and a lot of the people that play listen to the podcast.
5667000	5668000	Plug your larp, baby.
5668000	5669000	Plug it.
5669000	5670000	So it's called Dystopia Rising.
5670000	5672000	You can look up DystopiaRising.com.
5672000	5674000	Can I come and be one of the zombies that dies
5674000	5675000	when people throw bird seeds at?
5675000	5676000	Yes.
5676000	5677000	You guys can figure that out.
5677000	5678000	There is a game here in L.A.
5678000	5680000	It's played at a Ren fair.
5680000	5681000	How do you hire those people that come out
5681000	5682000	and just get bird seeds?
5682000	5684000	So everybody volunteers.
5684000	5686000	So every time you come to an event,
5686000	5689000	you do a four-hour shift as an NPC.
5689000	5691000	So you do a four-hour shift of being a zombie,
5691000	5693000	and then everyone kind of takes a turn at that.
5693000	5695000	So we'll have like a 150-person game,
5695000	5701000	and then from there, people will come and shift and be zombies.
5701000	5703000	Because that's what people picked.
5703000	5704000	I'm sorry.
5704000	5705000	We're having a side conversation.
5705000	5706000	You're trying to plug your larp.
5706000	5707000	I'm being really disrespectful.
5707000	5708000	It's called Dystopia Rising.
5708000	5709000	Dystopia Rising.
5709000	5711000	There are 13 chapters across the U.S. right now,
5711000	5713000	and it's growing pretty quickly.
5713000	5714000	You can probably find.
5714000	5715000	There's a lot on the East Coast,
5715000	5716000	but there's one up in Washington,
5716000	5718000	which is where I'm from, and then also in Oregon,
5718000	5719000	and then there's one here,
5719000	5722000	and then there's one in Indiana and Texas.
5722000	5723000	Yeah, they're all over.
5723000	5725000	The one in Indiana is really the best.
5725000	5727000	It's pretty good.
5727000	5728000	It was this past weekend.
5728000	5730000	I don't know how you knew that, but I know.
5730000	5731000	You know what would be exciting?
5731000	5733000	The combat part actually makes me kind of anxious,
5733000	5737000	but the idea of going out and going to a big thing
5737000	5739000	where it's like game on,
5739000	5741000	and then you have to be your character,
5741000	5742000	and then you're just walking around like,
5742000	5744000	hello, my name's Lord Fingleberry.
5744000	5745000	One of the best.
5745000	5749000	I could do that forever, really.
5749000	5750000	A lot of larps.
5750000	5751000	A lot of larps.
5751000	5752000	Because I hate myself.
5752000	5753000	I'm sorry.
5753000	5754000	No, Skyler's.
5754000	5756000	A lot of larps are built around combat,
5756000	5758000	and we call them stick jocks,
5758000	5760000	so they're guys that just like to hit each other with swords.
5760000	5761000	Right.
5761000	5762000	So the reason this game is so amazing
5762000	5764000	is because you stay in character from Friday to Sunday.
5764000	5765000	Nice.
5765000	5766000	All night.
5766000	5768000	You sleep in character, your door can get kicked in,
5768000	5771000	and zombies can fucking murder you.
5771000	5775000	So what if your character has night terrors?
5775000	5777000	I know characters with sleep apnea.
5777000	5778000	We have a medical time.
5778000	5779000	Oh, shit.
5779000	5780000	We have a medical time.
5780000	5784000	So the thing that's great is the whole universe is dystopian.
5784000	5786000	You know players with sleep apnea.
5786000	5787000	Yes.
5787000	5794000	All their characters are possessed by demons.
5794000	5797000	Oh, the power!
5797000	5800000	That'd be a serious larper who didn't really have sleep apnea,
5800000	5803000	but his character did.
5803000	5805000	You got a sleep in character?
5805000	5807000	But where was I going?
5807000	5809000	Okay, so this game has production.
5809000	5811000	So there are people that don't fight.
5811000	5812000	There are people that will just produce.
5812000	5814000	They build things, and they...
5814000	5815000	Like engineers?
5815000	5816000	There's farmers.
5816000	5817000	There's engineers.
5817000	5818000	There's tinkers.
5818000	5820000	They build guns and swords and upgrade armor and stuff like that.
5820000	5822000	Are there people that just hang out and drink?
5822000	5823000	There are totally people.
5823000	5825000	So we call them...
5825000	5826000	Technically, they're murder hobos.
5826000	5827000	They don't have jobs.
5827000	5828000	They don't produce anything.
5828000	5831000	They just hit stuff, and they just drink and are idiots.
5831000	5832000	Yeah, not like that.
5832000	5833000	Oh, just hang out?
5833000	5834000	There's totally people.
5834000	5836000	No, but I don't mean like a fratty guy crashing thing.
5836000	5837000	I mean like...
5837000	5839000	Could you be like a barkeeper?
5839000	5840000	Yes, totally.
5840000	5842000	There are multiple bars.
5842000	5843000	Across the universe.
5843000	5845000	Or like a bard just in the bar?
5845000	5847000	Yes, there's a profession called the entertainer
5847000	5848000	where you just play an instrument.
5848000	5849000	Dan, do you want to go do it?
5849000	5850000	Do stand-up comedy.
5850000	5852000	Yeah, I need a free weekend.
5852000	5854000	I want to do that, and I want to go inner tubing,
5854000	5856000	which Aaron's doing.
5856000	5858000	So that's what Aaron's doing right now.
5858000	5859000	She's floating down a river.
5859000	5860000	It's the best.
5860000	5861000	It's the only way I can...
5861000	5862000	It's the middle of the night.
5862000	5863000	Well, not in St. Louis.
5863000	5864000	Yeah.
5866000	5867000	Next time...
5867000	5868000	I bluffed.
5868000	5871000	Next time you come up north to like Seattle Portland area,
5871000	5876000	if you want to coordinate, I can get you and have...
5876000	5879000	That way I can control how good of an experience it is.
5879000	5881000	I wouldn't be able to send you to another place.
5881000	5882000	Scott, I've got to warn you.
5882000	5884000	Dan's a bit of a stick jock.
5887000	5889000	We take all kinds.
5889000	5891000	We're a very accepting community.
5891000	5893000	We have 30 seconds to play Shadowrun.
5893000	5896000	Well, keep in mind, the show starts at 8.20, so...
5896000	5897000	It doesn't.
5897000	5900000	Spencer, do you have a guest recapper for us?
5900000	5901000	Not today.
5901000	5904000	Let me just wing it terribly.
5904000	5905000	All right, here we are.
5912000	5915000	Last time on Shadowrun.
5915000	5920000	Our heroes found themselves in a tear gas filled hospital bed,
5920000	5924000	but they got out of there pretty quick.
5924000	5927000	Donning the disguises of downed security guards,
5927000	5932000	they scuttled down an elevator and passed a nosy receptionist
5932000	5935000	into a secret underground area.
5935000	5939000	There they found Baldwin Brown's former office,
5939000	5943000	and with it, the research data they were meant to retrieve.
5943000	5947000	But before they could retrieve it, Baldwin Brown himself
5947000	5949000	hailed our adventurers.
5949000	5951000	They're not adventurers in this game.
5951000	5959000	Shadowrunners over the comm link asking to return his research to him.
5959000	5962000	The gang studied the request before declining,
5962000	5967000	but as they were leaving, they heard the snick of blades.
5968000	5974000	Jesse Yellowman was here to collect on his employer's collection.
5977000	5979000	I said it was terrible.
5979000	5982000	I was not looking for that.
5982000	5986000	Now, Nightblade and then Team,
5986000	5989000	why did we say no to Baldwin Brown who wanted his stuff back?
5989000	5991000	Because we're terrible people.
5991000	5993000	Well, we didn't say no.
5993000	5995000	We said, well, think about it.
5995000	5996000	We got to do a job.
5996000	5999000	And real quick, remind me who Jesse Yellowman is, who?
5999000	6004000	He's the young ward of Baldwin Brown.
6004000	6007000	He's got blades coming up out of his knuckles.
6007000	6010000	And he wants Baldwin Brown's research for himself.
6010000	6014000	Well, he's like, hey, I'm going to pick it up,
6014000	6017000	pick up the research, the easy way or the hard way?
6017000	6023000	Well, kid, the hard way might be the easier way for us,
6023000	6026000	and the easy way may be harder for you than you think.
6026000	6029000	Huh.
6029000	6034000	Yeah, I'm not a mathematician, but there's like a thousand of us.
6034000	6036000	You sure aren't.
6036000	6039000	I cast level five stun ball on him.
6039000	6042000	All right, level five.
6042000	6044000	Okay.
6044000	6049000	You take three drain.
6049000	6053000	You go unconscious as you unleash a stun ball.
6053000	6055000	It wings him in the face.
6055000	6056000	Geez, that wasn't worth it.
6056000	6059000	He looks dazed as if he's been dazed,
6059000	6063000	but you are unconscious from the strain of repeated spell casting.
6063000	6065000	I should have asked what my drain was before I did that.
6065000	6066000	Yep.
6066000	6067000	All right, kid, can you hear me?
6067000	6068000	Can you hear me?
6068000	6069000	Somebody heal me?
6069000	6070000	Yeah, man.
6070000	6071000	We didn't say we weren't going to-
6071000	6075000	I already took out one of your guys.
6075000	6076000	Oh, come on, man.
6076000	6078000	That's not fair.
6078000	6082000	We didn't say we weren't going to work with your guy,
6082000	6085000	but if you're going to fight us, we're going to fight you.
6085000	6086000	Oh, sorry.
6086000	6087000	Okay.
6087000	6091000	I just- what's happening right now?
6091000	6093000	What's happening is we got the files.
6093000	6095000	We got to get the fuck out of this place.
6095000	6097000	Fighting each other isn't going to- it's not a good idea.
6097000	6100000	Maybe you should have said that before your friends started fighting at me.
6100000	6102000	I think you just fell on the ground.
6102000	6104000	How much are they paying you?
6104000	6105000	They're not paying me nothing.
6105000	6107000	I do it for the love of the job.
6107000	6109000	That's unfortunate.
6109000	6113000	Well, then I'll double your price to help us get out of this building,
6113000	6115000	and then we can fight in the street.
6115000	6116000	Well, I really need this research.
6116000	6119000	We can't let it get out of my hand.
6119000	6122000	You should pick her up and carry her out of here.
6122000	6126000	I can do that. I'm a troll.
6126000	6127000	You do that.
6127000	6129000	You easily heft her up on your shoulder.
6129000	6131000	Yes.
6131000	6133000	He's supposed to have Jeff's folder, right?
6133000	6134000	Yeah.
6134000	6135000	Okay.
6136000	6138000	Oh, shit. I was playing the wrong character.
6138000	6139000	Oh, yeah.
6139000	6142000	Well, you said- you were like, I'm going to play D'Morte.
6142000	6144000	I'm Hordegard. I forgot.
6144000	6147000	I don't cast a spell. I said it.
6147000	6149000	No one's unconscious.
6149000	6151000	No one's unconscious.
6151000	6154000	I don't cast a spell.
6156000	6164000	Is it possible that I maybe look at a thing and perhaps maybe French fries?
6164000	6166000	Wait, where the fuck is D'Morte?
6166000	6167000	D'Morte's here.
6167000	6169000	Is D'Morte here?
6169000	6171000	D'Morte was in the green room.
6171000	6173000	D'Morte, get out of here. Fucking-
6173000	6175000	Well, then we've got to kick someone out.
6175000	6178000	No, no. He can play himself. I'll just sit here.
6178000	6180000	D'Morte's round.
6189000	6191000	It's okay, Dan.
6191000	6195000	I was thinking at the time that we were in Edinburgh and-
6195000	6198000	I was going up with Nipsey Russell and his friends.
6198000	6202000	And you were caught up in a melee of some sort.
6202000	6204000	All right. Sorry.
6204000	6207000	I'm sorry I forgot you were here.
6207000	6209000	No worries, man. It's not my game.
6209000	6212000	Okay. So where were we?
6212000	6214000	We're going to get the fuck out of here.
6214000	6215000	Yeah. Here we go.
6215000	6217000	No one's unconscious.
6217000	6218000	No one's unconscious?
6218000	6220000	Are we doing a do-over on that?
6220000	6223000	Yeah. Because, yeah, he was controlling the wrong character.
6223000	6225000	All right. So here we all go.
6225000	6227000	Blade hand guy and everybody?
6227000	6228000	Where are we going?
6228000	6229000	We're leaving.
6229000	6230000	Where?
6230000	6232000	In an Uber.
6232000	6235000	Okay. We've got to go upstairs first.
6235000	6237000	Past all these dead bodies.
6237000	6239000	You've killed people?
6239000	6240000	Yeah. I mean, I wasn't really-
6240000	6243000	This was more of a hit and run sort of thing.
6243000	6244000	Not really.
6244000	6246000	Hey, HackEye?
6247000	6250000	Yes. I'm on the comm link.
6250000	6254000	Did this guy set off a bunch of alarms when he murdered all of these guards to get down here?
6254000	6256000	No. He's a real pro.
6256000	6258000	That's excellent. Thank you.
6258000	6262000	But they will find the bodies in a soon amount of time.
6262000	6264000	All right. Well, let's go.
6264000	6265000	And everyone stop asking how.
6265000	6267000	It's obviously the way we came.
6267000	6269000	Why do you keep asking that?
6269000	6271000	The way we came, we leave.
6271000	6273000	We leave the way we came.
6273000	6275000	Back out past the lady.
6275000	6278000	Into the elevators. Back up and out the exit.
6278000	6280000	Hodegard takes the lead.
6280000	6285000	Using his combat sense and all of his sensibilities leads them through to the front.
6285000	6289000	Up the stairs, around a couple floors and to the front.
6289000	6291000	Stepping over the bodies.
6291000	6296000	If you follow his actions, perhaps you will get there safely, as will I.
6296000	6298000	I follow him.
6298000	6306000	Following closely, you dodge the detection of guards with the combat senses of Hodegard.
6306000	6310000	You end up in the front hallway.
6310000	6313000	But there, you hear a voice behind you.
6313000	6317000	Stop. Stop you.
6317000	6321000	Turning around, you see 17 guards.
6321000	6323000	They're a good 60 feet off.
6323000	6325000	It's a long, long hallway.
6325000	6328000	You've made pretty good time, considering.
6328000	6330000	It's all right. I'm a guard.
6330000	6332000	No, what?
6332000	6335000	I'm dressed as a guard. I'm a guard.
6335000	6337000	Can I make a force wall?
6337000	6340000	Uh, yeah.
6340000	6344000	How strong of a force wall do you want to make? From one to six?
6344000	6345000	Five.
6345000	6348000	Oh, shit.
6348000	6350000	That's a good number.
6350000	6352000	It really is.
6352000	6355000	Drawing upon your troll magic.
6355000	6358000	You conjure up a shield of shimmering energy.
6358000	6368000	It stretches across the entire hallway, coating it in light and force energy.
6368000	6370000	Now we can run.
6370000	6374000	And using my city sense, I have a sense that the Uber is how far away?
6374000	6379000	You can sense an Uber just two blocks away.
6379000	6382000	This technology is really, really good.
6382000	6384000	It's a skill soft.
6384000	6389000	If you were addicted to them as I am, you would apply them and use them to their best benefit.
6389000	6393000	Hey, I'm not really a guard, you fuck faces.
6393000	6395000	We're behind a force field.
6395000	6397000	Just wearing guard clothes.
6397000	6402000	Potter guard leads the gang outside.
6402000	6408000	Those that will follow, those that want to talk trash, well, you know.
6408000	6411000	You guys go. I'm just leaving last.
6411000	6417000	Walking backwards, my arms spread like a cocky seagull talking shit.
6417000	6419000	I assure them that everything is OK.
6419000	6424000	This is common. He often uses the monologue defense to protect his people.
6424000	6426000	Who are you saying that to?
6426000	6428000	To the rest of the gang that is following.
6428000	6430000	Good.
6430000	6432000	Fuck you guys.
6432000	6435000	I wasn't a guard.
6435000	6437000	Fooled you.
6437000	6440000	Maybe we shouldn't tempt fate and just get in the Uber.
6440000	6442000	Just go. Yeah, I'm just saying.
6442000	6444000	I'm walking out backwards and talking shit.
6444000	6447000	Yeah. Yeah, you are.
6447000	6451000	By the way, I didn't kill all those people.
6451000	6455000	The door is closing. Is everyone in? Is everyone in?
6455000	6458000	Everyone's in the Uber, including Jesse.
6458000	6459000	Solid.
6459000	6460000	Sweet.
6460000	6462000	And we motor off.
6462000	6464000	Where are we going?
6465000	6469000	To our secret clubhouse.
6469000	6472000	Well, who wants these files that we got?
6472000	6474000	I do.
6474000	6475000	Two people.
6475000	6476000	But we don't want to give them to you, right?
6476000	6479000	Well, I hope you do.
6479000	6481000	Because otherwise we should have fought back there.
6481000	6484000	Well, I think it's easier now that we're in the car.
6484000	6486000	I don't think it's easy to fight in the car.
6486000	6493000	We're going to fight in a place where we can fight or discuss civilly or whatever.
6493000	6495000	Free of intervention.
6495000	6498000	Let's go to my apartment.
6499000	6502000	Shay Nightblade.
6505000	6506000	All right.
6506000	6510000	You can come link a map to that section to me or you can just give me your address.
6510000	6512000	Quip, quip, quip.
6512000	6514000	Done.
6514000	6515000	So be it.
6515000	6516000	Allow it.
6516000	6521000	I'm opening myself up a lot to you guys by inviting you to this place.
6522000	6524000	I'm a very private person.
6524000	6527000	This is like a big deal for me.
6527000	6529000	You roll up to your apartment.
6529000	6533000	If I recall correctly, it's not that nice.
6533000	6535000	Noted.
6538000	6543000	I tip the doorman a few nuyen.
6543000	6550000	Get in the neo-elevator and head up to the laser apartment.
6552000	6554000	It's not that nice.
6555000	6559000	Sorry, the robot made...
6559000	6561000	Is that a vacation?
6562000	6568000	Hoda God uses his perception of truth just to determine if there ever was a robot.
6569000	6570000	No.
6571000	6573000	As I suspected.
6574000	6577000	A guy like me is going to keep a low profile, have a lot of identities.
6577000	6578000	This is just one of them.
6578000	6581000	Do you know your neighbors?
6581000	6583000	No, and they don't know me.
6583000	6585000	That's why we're here.
6586000	6588000	This is where we'll never be found.
6588000	6590000	We can have a conversation.
6590000	6593000	Anybody want space drinks?
6593000	6594000	Future drinks?
6594000	6595000	Future drinks?
6595000	6596000	You want space drinks?
6596000	6597000	Space drinks?
6597000	6598000	Future drinks?
6599000	6601000	Do you happen to have Sputnik 1?
6601000	6602000	All right.
6602000	6604000	You got it?
6604000	6606000	Sputnik 1.
6606000	6608000	Sputnik 1.
6608000	6610000	The drink-o-matic.
6612000	6614000	Hydrate level four, please.
6617000	6619000	I should have made a pizza.
6620000	6622000	All right, here you go. Here's your drinks.
6622000	6623000	Now.
6623000	6625000	Yeah, what are we doing?
6626000	6629000	So, Billy Baldwin.
6629000	6630000	What's his name?
6630000	6632000	Baldwin Brown.
6632000	6634000	I thought we had Jesse, what's his name with us?
6634000	6636000	Jesse Yilman.
6636000	6639000	Yeah, but Baldwin Brown is in captivity.
6639000	6640000	Yep.
6640000	6644000	And sent his compatriot here to kill everybody and get the...
6644000	6646000	Wait, Jesse, you work for Baldwin?
6646000	6648000	Oh, yeah, we go way back.
6649000	6651000	He was my old teacher.
6652000	6656000	Baldwin was saying that the repercussions of us doing our job,
6656000	6663000	which we were contracted to do, were, you know, cataclysmic, shall we say.
6664000	6666000	You want to go into more detail about that?
6666000	6667000	Yeah, man.
6667000	6668000	Yeah.
6668000	6670000	I could do that.
6670000	6672000	I mean, I can't.
6672000	6674000	I don't know what his research was.
6674000	6676000	I just trust that it was really important.
6676000	6680000	If he says, bad shit's going to go down, I'd trust him.
6682000	6686000	Jesse, is it possible that if we were willing to give you this information,
6686000	6692000	the stuff that we stole with our skills, that you would maybe owe us a favor?
6692000	6693000	Yeah, no.
6693000	6694000	I mean, no doubt.
6694000	6696000	Look at this.
6696000	6700000	Knuckles, they shoot laser blades, razor blades.
6700000	6702000	Not laser blades.
6702000	6703000	Important distinction.
6703000	6704000	Laser razor blades.
6704000	6705000	Laser razor blades would have been way cooler.
6705000	6706000	I know.
6706000	6707000	You're telling me.
6707000	6710000	One of these days, I'll be able to afford them.
6710000	6712000	Right now, razor blades.
6712000	6713000	How much would those cost?
6713000	6718000	Oh, you know, 20 thou, 30, easy.
6718000	6721000	Well, the situation we're in is we took a job, you know,
6721000	6724000	and if we don't do it, then they're going to be after us forever.
6724000	6726000	So, I don't know.
6726000	6728000	How do you know they aren't already?
6728000	6730000	Are they going to come after us or are they just going to not pay us?
6730000	6732000	They're going to not pay us and they're going to be suspicious
6732000	6734000	if this shit ends up in the wrong hands.
6734000	6736000	You know, they're going to think that we did what we did.
6736000	6739000	Our crew isn't known for failing jobs.
6739000	6742000	So, I understand our reputation is pretty high, but...
6742000	6743000	Sarcasm.
6743000	6753000	I think that Jesse and Baldwin as allies might be better
6753000	6757000	than just some creds for the risk that we went through.
6757000	6760000	I'm sorry, Newyan.
6760000	6762000	I mean, we're shadow runners, you know.
6762000	6763000	We shadow run.
6763000	6765000	Sometimes runs fail, man.
6765000	6768000	But if we just go with these guys and then the next time
6768000	6770000	someone goes, I want to hire you for a shadow run,
6770000	6772000	hey, this isn't going to be one of those ones where you just decide
6772000	6775000	in the middle of it that it's like a meta shadow run
6775000	6777000	and you're going to bail on it.
6777000	6780000	We're going to go, no, no, we promise this time we really...
6780000	6783000	It would take like a whole big thing for that to happen.
6783000	6785000	Like someone asking us, please don't do the shadow run.
6785000	6786000	Then we'd have to...
6786000	6787000	Then we'd stop doing it.
6787000	6790000	But assuming that doesn't happen, we promise we'll do your shadow run.
6790000	6795000	What if we concocted an elaborate plan or scheme that would make it seem
6795000	6797000	that we didn't do this intentionally?
6797000	6800000	That they just hijacked this information from us
6800000	6803000	and we would know that we were being allies with them
6803000	6806000	but the rest of the world would think that we were just the victims
6806000	6807000	of their bullying.
6807000	6809000	I think Dr. Friend's onto something.
6809000	6811000	I think we are in a safe, secure location.
6811000	6814000	God damn it!
6814000	6817000	I'd knock a bunch of stuff off the counter.
6817000	6818000	Whoa.
6818000	6820000	Monologue alert.
6820000	6823000	You guys aren't hearing what I'm saying.
6824000	6827000	I fell down to the shadows from the heights of this society.
6827000	6831000	I go to the shadow runs because I gave up on that world.
6831000	6834000	If they want me back, they got to tell me why.
6834000	6835000	What's at stake?
6835000	6836000	What's going on?
6836000	6837000	I want to know what's going on.
6837000	6840000	I'm tired of these word games and puzzles and riddles.
6840000	6841000	You're double talking.
6841000	6842000	You're smart talk.
6842000	6844000	I'm just a big dumb shadow runner.
6844000	6845000	I want to know what's happening.
6845000	6847000	What's with these BTL chips?
6847000	6848000	Talk!
6848000	6849000	BTL chips are just drugs, man.
6849000	6851000	They fuck up your brain.
6851000	6852000	Yeah, so what?
6852000	6856000	So this research, I don't know, it might be able to help people.
6856000	6857000	Can we call Baldwin?
6857000	6858000	We need answers.
6858000	6860000	I got his number.
6860000	6863000	Put him up on a hologram or something.
6865000	6866000	All right.
6866000	6868000	So it's visually interesting.
6870000	6872000	Let me dial him up.
6872000	6874000	Beep, boop, beep, beep, beep.
6874000	6877000	Should we just kill this guy?
6878000	6880000	He seems kind of bad-ass.
6880000	6881000	It's Baldwin.
6881000	6882000	We kind of like him.
6882000	6883000	Hello.
6883000	6885000	Hey, what's up?
6885000	6887000	How did you guys get my number?
6887000	6889000	We're with Pink, Pink, Jesse Pinkman.
6889000	6890000	Oh, cool.
6892000	6893000	Wait, who's that?
6893000	6894000	We're with Jesse.
6894000	6895000	Jesse Yellowman.
6895000	6896000	Jesse Yellowman.
6896000	6897000	Oh, okay.
6897000	6899000	We're trying to work out a deal, but we need more information.
6899000	6900000	Uh-huh.
6900000	6901000	We want to know.
6901000	6902000	God damn it.
6902000	6903000	We want to know what's going on.
6903000	6906000	What's the worst thing that's going to happen if we don't give you your stuff?
6906000	6910000	Just world domination, but not by us.
6910000	6912000	Bad people domination.
6912000	6913000	That sounds pretty bad.
6913000	6915000	Sounds like standing, operating procedure.
6915000	6917000	Yeah, look out the window, Jack.
6917000	6918000	The bad guys won.
6924000	6926000	So you're saying Art Johnson's going to use this information,
6926000	6928000	your research, to take over the world?
6928000	6930000	Yeah, I mean, not just take it over.
6930000	6932000	Really murder it.
6932000	6939000	So the original price you were offering us for this reversal was what?
6939000	6941000	Oh, I mean, I don't have any money.
6941000	6942000	They don't really pay me.
6942000	6946000	But I will owe you two, three.
6946000	6947000	Three.
6947000	6949000	Of what?
6949000	6950000	Universes.
6950000	6952000	You know how people owe you one?
6952000	6953000	I'll owe you three.
6953000	6954000	Understood.
6954000	6955000	That's pretty good.
6955000	6958000	I believe those work in powers as well.
6958000	6960000	We can mute them.
6960000	6965000	I would like to place the hologram on mute.
6965000	6966000	Muting the hologram.
6966000	6967000	Muting the hologram.
6967000	6969000	How the guard is putting it on mute.
6969000	6970000	Okay.
6970000	6971000	And on blind.
6971000	6974000	So that he cannot see my lips moving.
6974000	6976000	So he cannot see my lips moving.
6976000	6981000	It is my contention that, look, we were hired to acquire certain properties.
6981000	6985000	We applied ourselves to the acquisition of such properties.
6985000	6992000	We were given assistance to assist in the acquisition of such properties.
6992000	6993000	We acquired such properties.
6993000	6994000	And it has become complicated.
6994000	6998000	And every route out of this otherwise becomes infinitely and infinitely more complicated.
6998000	7003000	The simplest route, the truest route, the route that is most shadowy of the running route,
7003000	7009000	is to complete it and deliver said properties and say completion of the deal.
7009000	7014000	Take our remuneration and move from there to the next job.
7014000	7015000	All right.
7015000	7016000	Occam's route.
7016000	7017000	Occam's route.
7017000	7019000	I agree with you.
7020000	7023000	Here comes a however alert.
7024000	7031000	However, I believe this is a turning point as us as runners to decide where we stand morally.
7031000	7032000	God damn it.
7032000	7035000	The reason they hire us is so that we don't have moral turning points.
7035000	7036000	But we have a choice.
7036000	7039000	We see the consequences of our actions.
7039000	7041000	That would make us chaffs.
7041000	7043000	Like not shadow runners.
7043000	7045000	We're supposed to shadow run.
7045000	7046000	I'm sorry.
7047000	7054000	When I was a child, man, child, man, little boy, man, my mentor was shot in the street in front of me.
7054000	7060000	I spent many of my days not around you guys suspending myself above a bottle of water
7060000	7064000	and using the vapor between me to draw truths.
7064000	7067000	So I'm not so much concerned with your moral, your morality.
7067000	7070000	This sort of world does not have that sort of morality.
7070000	7072000	It doesn't live in a plainer existence.
7072000	7074000	It has several dimensions and twists and turns.
7074000	7075000	And we are learning every day.
7075000	7078000	I still lunge and stun baton Jesse, the yellow man.
7078000	7079000	All right.
7079000	7081000	Then then I guess I'm just a face.
7085000	7086000	The very second.
7088000	7092000	Using robot reflexes, he dodges to the side.
7092000	7093000	Fuck.
7095000	7096000	That was a massager.
7097000	7098000	Yeah.
7098000	7099000	Yeah.
7099000	7100000	I just tried to stun him.
7100000	7101000	He disarms you.
7101000	7102000	He disarms me.
7102000	7104000	Now I got the stun baton, bitch.
7104000	7105000	Leafhanger!
7108000	7109000	God in heaven.
7111000	7113000	Let's thank Heather, everybody.
7113000	7114000	Skyler.
7114000	7115000	Darcin.
7116000	7117000	Zamorz Brown.
7118000	7119000	Spencer Crittenden.
7119000	7121000	I'm Jeff Davis, your mayor.
7121000	7122000	Dan Harmon, everybody.
7124000	7126000	The show brought to you by the Apple Watch.
7130000	7131000	Thank you for coming.
7132000	7134000	We went a little bit late, but we do serve breakfast.
7135000	7138000	Breakfast will be outside in the meltdown comic lounge.
7143000	7144000	Did you get any of that?
7145000	7147000	It's a good show.
