0	14160	I hear music and there's no one there. Smell blossoms and the trees are bare. All night
14160	18440	and long I'm walking on there. I wonder why. I wonder why.
18440	24680	Hello, everybody. From Hollywood, California. Meltdown Comics, the nerdest theater. Harman
24680	46880	town is now in session, please. Tonight's attendance, 40,000 people. I love it. I love
46880	57920	it. Please welcome the stage, the mayor of Harman town, Mr. Dan Harman. Thank you. What
57920	62320	a crowd. I don't know. What is it? Should we ask them? There's a million people here.
62320	65040	What's going on? Is there a convention? I think it's the World Cup. They have World
65040	73440	Cup people. They heard my World Cup coverage and they're like, okay. Well, I'm sure it's
74080	80320	unrelated, but I was just getting some statistics. Some people like to celebrate this stuff. I got
80320	85760	into podcasting to forget about numbers. I'm fleeing a world too obsessed with ratings and
85760	91600	things. I come here to not pay attention to these things. However, Harman town, but when we went
91600	98880	out on tour, I don't know, we used to get like 60,000 to 80,000 downloads per episode. Now we're
98880	105920	up to like 100,000 per episode. We had a million total when we went on that tour where we made
105920	113120	that movie that no one ever gets to see. Now we just passed, I was told in the green room,
113120	123520	10 million downloads total. I'm sure a lot of people download them multiple times.
123520	131360	I don't know. I don't know what you kids do. This is for freezies. We don't care. We don't
131360	135600	care about no numbers. I want to talk for one person. My giant new podium here. This is really
135600	140160	exciting. Yeah, Jessica, a new podium. It looks like I'm like a 56 Buick. It's really
140880	145440	it's got a big light on the front with a logo we'll have to swap out for our own.
146160	153920	Yeah, it's pretty great. I like this. All right. So what are we going to talk about? I just started
153920	159600	doing couples therapy. It's kind of, it's more like marriage, pre-marriage counseling. You and Rob?
163680	168640	It's a long time coming. No, Aaron and I are, you know, we want to make sure the
168640	173520	ship's all airtight before we take it out to the sea. Am I right in recalling that she called it
173520	179920	engagement camp? Yeah, well, the counselor offers a six-week program that she calls
180560	186000	marriage camp or something like that. Really? But after our consultation, she's like, I don't know,
186000	194000	you know, maybe you guys should do this for a long time. Maybe not so much a camp as like a condo.
196080	201920	Let's TP more of an asylum. How many have you been to? Just one. There was one consultation,
201920	206560	and then we just had our first one on Friday. I'm very curious about that.
208240	215760	It's pretty great. I think the most important thing is to have language. Because as we all know,
215760	225360	relationships, the big thing, the big obstacle for them is that they're competing in their most
225360	231040	crucial phases with something that you can't compete with, which is the courtship phase,
231040	237120	where there's hormones, chemicals pumping through your body, looking at this person across the room,
237120	245360	you know, the whole high fidelity monologue with John Cusack. When your lover is a stranger to you
245360	252160	and you just love drinking a big glass of water of how you look in their eyes and everything is
252160	258080	fantastic, it's like, then you seal a deal. And that's when the really rewarding stuff starts to
258080	263520	happen, like a 30 year life together, for instance. But at the same time, the big problem
263520	274480	with that is that you can sometimes feel like, well, now I'm not on fire all the time. Now you
274480	280080	know what a shitty person I am. Now we fight sometimes. And then the person I had that fight
280080	285280	with is still there. It's not like you're getting a fight and you're like, I don't want to see you
285280	290640	anymore. We got to fight. Now I'm going to keep seeing you forever because I love you. But we had
290640	300240	like eight fights. And I think the coolest thing that combats that phenomenon is this shared
300240	308240	language. I think that's when artifice really comes in handy. You get tools, you get told like,
308240	314800	okay, this is a phrase we use for this thing, so that you both know that phrase, so that you're
314800	320400	not just on autopilot. And when you start to get into a fight or something, you actually have a
320400	325200	thing that you can talk about, say, go like, oh, is this a scenario seven, you know, kind of thing.
326160	333600	My big thing was that my epiphany has been this thing that the counselor called emotional bids.
334720	341200	Emotional bids, Jeff. Bids. Yeah. So, you know, when there's two people in a conversation,
341200	346320	my thing has always been, well, one person's always going to need something and then the
346320	350800	other person's always going to be having to give it, which means that one person's getting like
350800	357120	robbed. You know, like I always feel like everyone's trying to steal my life force away from me,
357120	362320	my time, my energy, like fish hooks are coming at me and they're going to get into me. And if I
362320	369040	don't fend them off and police my own space, I'm going to get dragged into someone else's
369040	374560	like energy and I'm going to get dragged down and I'm going to lose my life for three hours of
374560	382240	playing Borderlands 2 or something. The counselor said, here's the thing that couples do,
382240	388080	they make emotional bids. So you say like, for instance, one of my big things that makes me
388080	393200	insane is that if I'm driving and Aaron says, look at that, look at that thing over there.
393200	396320	My immediate emotional reaction is to go, God damn it, I don't want to look at shit.
396560	406000	So I always, I hate it when people, that's my extreme example of like how, that's how extreme
406000	411520	it is with me. Like I hate fucking, like I hate when people go like, look at that. Like I'm
411520	417040	thinking, I hate you. Don't make me look at it. I have my own head. I can swivel it. I have eyes.
417040	425600	If I want to look at something, I'll look at it. Like that's me being crazy. But that's just
425600	429760	an example of like somebody saying, look at that, or somebody saying like, oh Game of Thrones is on
429760	438480	tomorrow. Like anything, any sound you make, any anything, it's an emotional bid. My new way
438480	442400	of seeing it, the counselor said it to me. Wait, why is it a bid? Explain it to me.
442400	450240	Well, I'm going to. Don't interrupt me. Again, don't. Look over here. No. Look over here.
450240	460640	You have to think of the relationship as a third thing in the room with you and your lover.
461760	467120	When a person wants something from you, don't even look at it that way. You think of it as them
467120	474640	putting a little poker chip, a bid into the relationship bank. You know, so you don't have
474640	478560	to think about it like I have to give you something or you need something. It's like,
478560	486160	it's you putting something in to this third thing. And then you can have three responses
486160	494000	to that. One of three, you can do what's called facing forward, which is like acknowledging it,
494000	499920	which is a form of putting your own bid in there to match it. And so, and both parties are going
499920	505200	to draw checks on this bank from time to time. You need your relationship to be there when you're
505200	509840	feeling bummed out. Sometimes you're sick or you're in a bad mood. You feel fat. You want to,
509840	515920	you go like, oh, can I fall back on this relationship? And if it's overdrawn,
515920	520720	if there's no trust, it's like somebody puts a bid in it. And then if you go like,
520720	526000	but for example, by saying like, oh, our favorite show's on tonight. If you go, yeah, yeah. Like
526000	530320	that's you taking the bid out, like wiping your ass with it. I don't know where the metaphor goes,
531040	535360	but you're not, you're not matching it. And then what happens is, and this happens a lot with,
535360	541200	with men and women is that, is that like, um, because men have this thing or they're, they're,
541200	546800	they're just like, they think too logically in their discourse. So it's like, look, look at that
546800	551040	thing. Isn't that pretty? And then the guy will tend too often to go like, I don't see how that's
551040	555920	more pretty than anything else in particular, like trying to, like trying to make sure, because I
555920	560800	think we're socialized. At least American men are socialized to like be more logical,
560800	567120	not change our minds and all this stuff. And then like, uh, so, so that's like an example of you,
567120	572240	you betray the trust and then, and then like the other person will double down on the bid.
572240	577600	They start putting more shit in there and then they get all messed up. And like, they go like,
577600	584400	I don't know. I do everything and you don't do anything. And it's like, it comes out at
584400	588720	random times. Like, I could put so many, so much shit into this relationship and all that stuff.
588720	593360	All you gotta do is just like retrain your brain, even if it's perfunctoral,
593360	597440	because they've done these studies where they take like, they finally started, uh,
597440	603360	taking like couples science into like, like they just study us like animals now and they,
603360	609040	and they just take like people who are happy as couples and they just study their behavior.
609040	614800	And they've found that if you can make bad couples emulate good couples behavior,
614800	619040	you, the bad couples can turn into good couples. They get happy. So what is the good behavior?
619040	624000	The good behavior is that is just that rhythm of matching emotional bids. Like someone,
624000	629920	if someone petitions the relationship for acknowledgement, then you gotta,
629920	634240	you gotta ring that bell too. You just, just once that's it. Hey, look at that bridge. Oh,
634240	638080	yeah, that's a great bridge. Like without being sarcastic, you know, you don't have to agree
638080	642960	that it's a great bridge, but you also don't be a shithead. Like just, just say, yeah,
642960	647120	it's a great bridge. Like, like, like, like, like, just, just stopped, you know, face forward,
647120	653040	like, like literally physically face the person that wants your attention and engage them for
653040	657120	just as much time as they said, game of thrones is on tomorrow. Yeah. Isn't that show great?
657120	660480	Like just, just fucking match it. Don't, I want to talk about this. Look over there.
660480	664000	Think and look at the bridge thing. Like, is that, is that, are you, are you making that up?
664000	668560	Or is it an actual thing? If Aaron says, hey, look, hey, that restaurant's closed. And I got,
668560	672720	I got, I got, that's, you might have a bad reaction to her just saying, look at that thing.
672720	679360	Yes. Yes. Really? I, anybody, I can't handle like, like my, I can't, I don't multitask. So if I,
679360	683600	like, you never, no one ever knows when I'm thinking about something that, that like,
683600	689360	I could just be standing or doing nothing. And what you don't know is that I'm actually engaged
689360	695600	in something mentally. Right. And then somebody goes like, like, you like hot dogs? Like, like,
695600	699840	if, if I was literally not thinking about anything, if I was just going like, I hope someone talks to
699840	704320	me and someone goes, you like hot dogs? I'll go like, Oh, I like all kinds of them. I like foot
704320	709760	logs and, uh, I like mustard. And, and, and, uh, and that person's like, God, I'm so glad I came over
709760	716160	and talked to Dan Harmon. But if I, here I am, I'm not only am I, I'm learning about hot dogs.
716160	722480	I thought I knew about them. He's, he knows more. And, and, and then we're like, you know,
722480	728800	cut to us, like just arm in arm, like at a hot dog store of some kind. But, but if I'm standing
728800	734400	there and I happen to be like running some kind of like program, like I'm going like, Oh, I've got,
734400	739840	just thinking about something like running through a conversation in my head or, you know,
739840	744880	creating my next masterpiece, of course. Uh, you guys didn't laugh hard enough at that.
746240	750000	Now I feel like a shithead. Uh, didn't sound like a joke.
758960	765360	And then you're like hot dogs. I'm like, what? Yeah. Yeah. Like, like, like mad, like shaking you
765360	769680	off. Like you're a mosquito. What, what, what, what are you asking me? Because I don't even
769680	775600	hear it the first time. I just hear like noise, like, and I'm like, what, what, what, what, what,
775600	780880	what do you want? Do I just ask if you like hot dogs? Okay. Oh yeah. I like hot dogs.
782240	786800	Jesus Christ. You know, like kind of like creating a masterpiece in my mind.
788640	796640	Uh, so, so that may or may not ever change about me, but what can change about me is I can go from
797440	804240	not valuing the relationship enough to take action to valuing the relationship enough to take action.
804240	809200	So, so if it's like, it's not about me, that was my big fear about couples therapy is like, oh,
809200	812960	they're going to pop the hood open on me. I know it's not her. That's going to have to change a
812960	818720	bunch of shit for us to be happy. There's going to be fucking blue wires and red wires going to be
818720	824720	cut. And one of them is going to blow up and, um, but, but it's not that, it's not really that case.
824720	829360	It's like, it's for better or for worse, the kind of like the couples therapy perspective is
829360	833360	if you're fucked up, you're fucked up. But how do you, how do you make a relationship work with a
833360	838960	fucked up person? I, the fucked up person, like what, while you're fucked up, here's some things
838960	844560	you can do to make your relationship not fucked up. So in that moment, now, now that you have that,
844560	850640	that, that intellectual knowledge of like the emotional bids thing now, when you're in your
850640	854560	own, because I'm also the same way. And I think probably most of us are, uh, like I get lost in
854560	858080	my own thoughts. And when someone interrupts them, I have no idea what's going on. Like I, I,
858080	862560	I'm kind of listening where I'm kind of also caught up in my own shit. Now, if Aaron says,
862560	867440	look at that bridge, or do you like hot dogs, you're still going to probably react in that first
867440	872800	moment of, no, emotionally. Yes. Like I, I won't be able to stop myself from, uh, like the counselor
872800	877840	says, it's like, uh, when you hit your knee with a hammer, it's just a reflex reflexes or reflexes,
877840	884880	but you have an internal reflexive reaction, but that can be a, um, uh, dinner bell. Like,
884880	890240	like, that can be like a triangle that rings that you, that is a reminder. Oh, this is the,
890240	899040	that moment where I, I do that thing where I stop, face her and acknowledge what she just said.
900160	906320	And then go back to, you know, so it's like, yeah, it's literally just changing your behavior.
906320	909920	So, so you're, you're, you're lost in thought. You're creating a masterpiece. Someone says,
909920	913040	do you like hot dogs? You, you, you hear what, what, what, what, what? So in my head I go,
913040	918720	what the fuck? Oh, who's, what does he want? Shut up. And then I turn, I sound like,
918720	923920	like, uh, did you say, do I like hot dogs? Yes, I did. Uh, yeah, I, yeah, I do. Oh, thank you.
927120	934480	I'm so glad I talked to Dan Harmon. And you know what, sir, um, if I was just thinking about, uh,
935120	939520	uh, uh, my next masterpiece. So, uh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude,
939520	944480	but I'm going to go back to that. That's my emotional bid. Now he can either honor that
944480	948960	or not. He can, he can be like, fuck off. You just get your head out of your ass. You fucking
949680	956400	fuck. Um, whatever. But, but, but yeah, it's like, like, that's another form of an emotional
956400	961040	bit is to be honest about whether or not you want to hang out or need space. How do you know when,
961840	965120	I guess the metaphor for the bid thing is that you can, you can keep
965120	968960	anti-ing and someone can keep just taking the money off the table and not put anything back in.
969840	978400	That's every guy's first question is what if, uh, you keep matching emotional bids and you keep
978400	983600	having a look at 20 bridges per second. Um, that's my, it was my first question. And then I went to
983600	987120	the Rick and Morty writer's room and I was so excited about these tools I had learned. And every
987120	992560	guy was like immediately was like, what if, but what if you look at the bridge and then say,
992560	996880	well a nice bridge and then you got to do it again, five seconds later that, that what if,
996880	1006640	what if the other person abuses me doing the normal right thing, uh, and, uh, is called mistrust
1006640	1013840	and, and trust is the foundation of a relationship. So you can, you can change anything you want about
1013840	1018880	a house, but if you don't have trust in a relationship, uh, it doesn't, it just doesn't
1018880	1023760	matter. It's just like a fucked up house. So, so, so you just have to fucking jump it. Like,
1024560	1027920	you just have to do the sides of it. You're not going to have to look at 20 bridges. There aren't
1027920	1033840	20 bridges. She's like, like, she really, she really just wants, it's like breathing. It's
1033840	1038400	respiration. Look at the, look at the bridge. It's nice. It's just like, am I, am I in a relationship
1038400	1044000	with you on a, on just a microscopic little penny stock level? Like, like, like just a little
1044000	1049120	micro trade, like that keeps this fucking market going. Look at that bridge. Yeah. Okay. I see that
1049120	1055360	bridge. Yes. I am in the space with you. I am not, I am not numb. I am not like, like astral
1055360	1062800	projecting over Miami right now. What are you, what is your stance on bridges? Like, do you,
1062880	1065120	do you like bridges? I don't ever need to look at them. I,
1067440	1072560	I think that people put them there because there was something that needed to be ignored.
1074880	1080320	Like a ravine. Look at that ravine. People were saying, look at that ravine and they're like,
1080320	1085680	yeah, we got to put a bridge over that thing. Now, 20 years later, there's a bridge on that.
1085680	1089200	Let's say it's like how, like, I don't have to worry about my, the teeth fillings.
1089920	1097040	It filled the teeth. I just got to eat the corn. I'm living my life. I want to look at my teeth.
1097040	1100480	What about the Brooklyn bridge or the San Francisco Golden Gate? It's just a big dumb
1100480	1106160	thing. That's just a big dumb thing. Jeff, it's a bridge. Who cares? Seven people died in the
1106160	1110080	construction of that. They should, they, they were probably looking at the fucking bridge too much.
1112000	1117440	Oh, look at this bridge I'm building. No, look at your work. They died when there was no bridge.
1117440	1121440	They died when it was still a river. Well, it's so good. It's good. They built the bridge. Thank
1121440	1126240	you for dying. I don't want to look at the, I don't want to look at the bridge. Why not? Because
1126240	1131520	it's a bridge. I just, I see it on a postcard. It's everywhere. It doesn't matter. I see it on TV.
1131520	1135120	Do you like, do you like buildings? You like to see a skyscraper? No, I don't like architecture.
1135120	1140560	I think it's all dumb. I don't, I think that's what we're learning right now is that you just,
1140560	1144160	like, there are certain things that some people find fascinating that you, that you disregard.
1144160	1147360	Yeah. Do you like nature? Like you say, look at that sunset. Look at that mountain. Barely.
1149040	1153440	Nature gets this much from me. I, when we were at, you know, if I'm, if I'm in a new climate,
1153440	1162320	like when we went to Banff, the city's so nice they, they removed its vowels.
1164000	1167120	It was like in the middle of a national party. So nice they effed it twice.
1167440	1172880	Uh, the, uh, yes, that's okay. Thank you. Yes. That did deserve applause.
1175520	1177200	It deserved exactly that much.
1179200	1182160	No, it didn't deserve a standing ovation. It deserved a nice polite.
1183360	1186080	It was like a parlor trick. What you did there. It was like,
1186080	1188720	it was like, like if you'd made a ping pong ball come out of my nose,
1189680	1194560	it would deserve that much applause. Uh, yeah, if it's breathtaking, you know, it's like, wow,
1194560	1200000	look at that. That looks like the shining. That looks like, uh, what you, it looks like that movie.
1200000	1204880	I like, you know, but you can't look at all those trees. There's so many trees. You never,
1204880	1207600	you're never just driving on the road or just stop and go, Oh my God,
1207600	1210320	let's fucking beautiful water. Right. I tried to do that once.
1214240	1217280	I took a road trip by myself. Were you hurt during the process?
1218480	1222240	I remember like, I'm just going to drive and I'm going to like, look at nature.
1222240	1225280	Was this your vision question? Yeah, my vision question. I ended up just eating
1225280	1231680	a different sizzlers across the country because I don't know what I'm doing. And I was like,
1231680	1235920	I'm just going to get out there and like, throw a blade of grass in the air and whichever way it
1235920	1240720	points, I'm going to drive that way. And you know, I'm going to meet Reese Witherspoon and she's
1240720	1246480	going to guide me on a thing and make a mix tape for me and I'm going to get cancer and then recover.
1247440	1253200	I'm, I'm all the shins are going to be playing and I'm going to be like, like finding shit is going
1253200	1263200	to be me in a silhouetted against the sun on a cliff edge going. It's just different hotels.
1263200	1267680	People are going, do you have a reservation? No. Well, what are you, what were you thinking?
1268640	1279040	I'm on a vision quest in Denver. I didn't know I was going to end up here. Ooh, la la.
1280800	1285360	You're in the asshole suite. There's, there's, there's coffee in the morning.
1286800	1292320	Do you not want us to tell you that? Chief, chief vision quest.
1292640	1298800	Uh, no, I want to know there's coffee. Uh, I got, I was like, I was like, I'm just going to drive.
1298800	1303280	I don't know how to take this back road. And then the sun was setting over this field and I was like,
1303280	1310480	that's, I bet that's the kind of thing that people call beautiful. And I'm going to, you mean human
1310480	1316240	beings. I'm going to get out of the car and enjoy it like in a movie. And I, and I, I pulled my car
1316240	1321280	over. It was like perfectly quiet and beautiful. And I got out of the car and stepped out of the
1321360	1331840	car and I was just like into a cloud of gnats. And I ran five feet down the road. Jesus Christ,
1331840	1336880	gnat cloud and the gnats like followed me. Like imagine that cloud of gnats. Like, like, they're
1336880	1341920	like, do they like heads? Like, wait, wait, wait. I don't understand gnat clouds. Like,
1341920	1347600	are they waiting for a head? And then, and then when one comes to them, they're like, we're stoked.
1347600	1351440	I think that you, you perceive a gnat cloud because your head is in a bunch of gnats.
1352640	1355760	There's also gnats over there too. You can stick your head.
1355760	1360960	They're in clouds, gnats. There's like a cloud, such a thing as a cloud of gnats. It's an isolated,
1362320	1367680	localized phenomenon. There's, you know, they cluster. They like, they like each other. I don't
1367680	1372400	know if that's just them reproducing or, or you're talking, sharing notes on gnat-
1372880	1377840	stur-ree. And then your head goes in it, but it seems like once your head goes in it,
1377840	1382000	they're like, there's a head. And then like you, you move your head and they like move with you.
1382000	1387440	Because they're like, it's a head. That's our new religion. We love this guy's head.
1389760	1393600	Because they love to go in your nose and your ears and like, like, like,
1393600	1401360	they're little grottos. Like, like gnats are like hooking up in your mouth. Anyways,
1401760	1405840	so I got back in the car and, uh, yeah, I never got out of it again.
1407200	1410400	And I'm still happy. I'm still, I'm still creating masterpieces.
1411760	1416400	But are you saying that you're, you, you don't generally, or frequently, or sometimes once in
1416400	1420320	a while have like look around and go, oh shit, like that's, I want to-
1420320	1425520	Yeah, no, so I like, like, I like weather, like, like, I go like, oh, it's such a beautiful night,
1425520	1432800	like when it's really nice, you know, like, yeah, I like that tactile, like, things like, oh,
1432800	1440800	what a nice feeling night, like a little salty blanket around me. It's a salty blanket.
1442400	1445920	Do you, do you, do you, do you want me to give you a salty blanket?
1447600	1449840	Is that where you jitter my head or something like that?
1450880	1453040	It's a little just to call it out like that.
1454000	1460640	Uh, why don't, why don't, why don't, uh, oh, oh, and also, hey, listen to this. So listen, listen,
1460640	1462880	listen to the sound my throat makes when I laugh now.
1466480	1472400	You have to listen, listen for the, like, it sounds like a, a card and bicycle spokes.
1479200	1482080	What on earth? That's not good.
1482080	1488080	That's what I asked the doctor. That's not good. I went to, I went to a eyes, nose, and throat guy.
1488080	1491760	What is that about? Well, I don't know. I want to fucking answer. I don't, I don't want to live
1491760	1496400	in a world where there's no answer for that. Well, he put a camera, at first he numbed my nose,
1496400	1505040	he put by shoving a wad of cotton up my nose and he gave me five minutes, I'll give you five minutes,
1505040	1512480	that'll numb your nose. You'll thank me. Ha ha ha. And then he came back and, uh, like,
1513520	1517600	like what do they do when they leave for five minutes? Did that, is that just like, like,
1517600	1522800	doctors fucking suck. They're the worst. They're just terrible. He's not going to hang out for the
1522800	1526880	five minutes that you, you're going to get numb. He's going to go do the thing, answer an email,
1527680	1534400	play some Candy Crush. He played Candy, I think he plays Candy Crush. So he comes back and then
1534400	1540160	he takes this camera, which is like, it's like a spaghetti noodle, like a black spaghetti noodle.
1540720	1547360	And he just inserts it into my nasal passage and I can feel it. It says, it won't, this won't hurt,
1547360	1555280	but it will tickle. And he was, he was right, but it will hurt psychologically to know a thing is
1555280	1561840	invading your fucking passages. It didn't physically hurt, but it broke my mind.
1562800	1569520	It made me feel small and like an animal. Uh, made me feel like a small animal,
1570800	1578000	like, uh, like, uh, like an ocelot at a zoo. And, and, and they're, and they're just like,
1578000	1582320	he just like kept feeding it and I can feel it going down my throat. Like it was like,
1582320	1586320	you're totally like, you're awake. Yeah. I'm just hanging out. I'm sitting in a chair. And he gave
1586320	1590240	you a, like a local anesthetic nose. Yeah. Meanwhile, there's this thing going down your throat.
1590240	1596800	Yeah. Yeah. And he's like, okay. Uh, say E cause I don't know if he's just trying to be different.
1599200	1602960	I'd say it probably opens up your, like, ah, is up your liver. So you're,
1602960	1607680	well, why not? Ah, is he just trying to be hip? I don't know. I think he sounds more,
1607680	1610720	maybe I think he's like, ah, he's like fucking bullshit. Yeah.
1611760	1617680	Say, ah, it's a silver lake man. Say E. Um, it wasn't something and say,
1618000	1623360	E. So I said E and then every time I said it, like I could feel it with fucking like nose
1624000	1627760	membrane vibrating. That's why he had you say E cause he knew that would fucking happen.
1627760	1633600	Oh, he's not looking at my nose thing. That's just where the cables run down my fucking throat.
1633600	1637520	But that's symptomatic of something in my throat. So he says like, okay, there's no,
1637520	1641120	there's no tumors on your vocal cords. He just fucking blurted that out. I'm like,
1641840	1646880	uh, thanks for letting me know that was a possibility. So, so when I, when you heard
1646880	1651600	that, you thought let's look for that tumor. Let's find out where that tumor is and just,
1651600	1655040	and just kept your fucking cool. That that's what he should have done with that five minutes.
1655920	1659120	Well, my nose numbed. You said, God, I'm going to take this five minutes to talk about,
1659120	1663360	talk to you about cancer because then you, then your throat would tighten up and the thing
1663360	1666960	wouldn't get in there. You want to be fucking loose as a goose. So everything's, everything's
1666960	1671360	built on a lie and these, in these buildings and it's full of these people in white coats
1671360	1677040	that, that, that they have. Take it easy, man. There's no, there's no, I've said it,
1677040	1684400	said it before. I'll say it again. A serial killer is, is just a doctor without a parental
1684400	1690000	support system. It's just, it's just, it's just a kid who didn't couldn't afford medical school.
1690720	1694400	They all start by looking at a cat under the crawl space and it gets pulled out. They all
1694400	1698960	go like, Oh, that's neat. I want to see what's inside there. And then, then some of them end up
1698960	1707280	just stalking the fucking streets of, of, of Buffalo. And then others end up charging you 60
1707280	1715360	grand to, to, to hit your knee with a hammer. You live in a terrifying world. You just like,
1715360	1719280	like these people, like they want to open you up and they love it. They love it. And everything's
1719280	1725120	a shot with them. Like I can't wait to put a needle in you and take out your plasma out of your body,
1725120	1734080	your vital liquids, you, the seawater simulation that we evolved to carry with us to keep us alive.
1735200	1739120	You know, like when we came out of the ocean. Are you having a stroke right now, man?
1741680	1742960	I'm worried about you right now.
1742960	1748080	Do it again.
1753600	1756000	How do we know? I'm pretty sure that's a tumor.
1758000	1761920	It's gotta be a tumor. What makes sense? It's not a tumor. It's not a tumor.
1762560	1770000	So dumb. Don't come on. That does, that does deserve applause too. Not more than the F'd it twice.
1770000	1775520	Certainly not. Certainly not. There's different reasons to applaud.
1775520	1780880	That was some coolie level shit. He said tumor. I can, it was not a tumor.
1782560	1786480	Anyways, not to, not to punish you to keep your reactions organic. You,
1787120	1789760	I'm not going to punish you. I'm fucking alarmed at that sound.
1793760	1799600	There's like a dude in there. There's like an indie film being produced in there about a guy
1799600	1804960	in a larynx who's like, where am I? I can't imagine why, but a fellow's raising his hand
1804960	1810320	over here. Please be a doctor. I have tumors on my vocal cords, not a big deal.
1816080	1820160	I'm not sure we got that on mic. He said, I have tumors on my vocal cords, not a big deal.
1821440	1826080	All right, cool. Well, I don't have them. So I probably have something worse. Is the tumor in
1826080	1833040	your trachea a big deal? Okay. Well, now I get to, do you make that sound when you do an exhale
1833040	1840960	like that? As far as I know, I don't know. Try it out. The reason why I found out about it is because
1840960	1845200	of all this podcaster-y, like I've been listening to myself. You can hear it and like Aisha Tyler's
1845200	1852000	podcast. Like you hear, when I laugh, I go off and go and then, and then like, like, it sounds
1852080	1855040	like the mic's broken or something. Maybe you're just, maybe you're just purring.
1856720	1859600	Anyways, there's no discomfort or anything. It's just the sound. So I,
1861200	1867680	please all be doctors. Do you snore too? I snore and I do, when I gain a certain amount of weight,
1867680	1874160	I get sleep apnea. Like I, I'll wake up like freaking out. Thank you for asking.
1874160	1882960	Uh, these are questions the guy asked a doctor. So he pulls the camera out. He pulls it out,
1882960	1885600	which was so fucked up. Like, it was like, it was like, you know, does he pull it out like,
1885600	1894800	like just like anal beads and just like anal beads? Yeah. Like yank. I'm assuming nasal beads.
1898960	1902560	Yeah. It was kind of like, like, like these people don't care about the, you know, they, they look at
1902560	1905840	us like, they look at us like animals. I'm assuming they were used to that because it's
1905840	1910000	got to be tech technology. How do they clean that thing off? It's been done a million people.
1910000	1913840	Yeah. He just put it down and I'll bet you 10 bucks. The next guy that came in, he's probably,
1913840	1918480	he probably sprays it with like a mist of like avian or something.
1920240	1925760	He probably like runs it under a, a, a, a UV light or something like that, that,
1925760	1931440	that some pharmaceutical company gave him for free to push pills. There is that from, from
1931440	1940160	razoplaz. It's a free gift. This, this UV light will make all the aids go off of your, uh, equipment.
1940160	1947920	Go ahead and trust us and don't forget razoplaz. For every $80 razoplaz prescription, we'll give you
1947920	1954400	a golf club. So he pulls it out. Do you have anything that he say? Here's why you're, you,
1954400	1958320	you make that sound all of a sudden? No, he said, he said no tumors on your vocal cords,
1958320	1963520	which I'm now finding out would have been the fucking jackpot. No, it just wouldn't have been
1963520	1971600	a big deal, man. Um, and now, and then he said, okay, so now I'm going to get, here's what I,
1971600	1978000	here's what we have to eliminate as a possibility. You have acid reflux. Uh, what sometimes can
1978000	1983760	happen is it'll during your sleep, some acid will splash into your trachea. Trachea will swell up
1983760	1988880	a little bit and that can make that sound. Uh, like the, like, I don't know. It's like a flappy,
1988880	1995040	it looks like your trachea is farting when you're exhaling, like, um, because it's a little swollen
1995040	2000320	from the acid. So he gives me like advanced prilosec, like a kind of like free samples of
2000320	2004800	some kind of shit. And, and he gave me a shot of cortisone because I, I honestly think it's just
2004800	2009120	because they like to hurt people. I don't, I don't, I don't know the cortisone was supposedly,
2009120	2012320	it was supposed to clear the pathways or something. They just, they just don't feel like they've done
2012400	2017920	their job unless they've inflicted some kind of torture on someone. They take an oath and
2017920	2022320	that's the first line. I know. But why do you think that is? If you protest too much, you know,
2022320	2029280	like, like, like, okay, all right. I swear to God, I'm not a serial killer. If you have to say that
2029280	2037200	before you go to work, like fucking go to check it out. You know, I don't know, man. Paranoid.
2038160	2044880	It's just, it's called, uh, well, uh, latrophobia, fear of doctors.
2047040	2052880	Look it up, man. All right. So you're good. You're all right. No, I'm not good. I mean, I'm my,
2053760	2061360	I mean, I'm Schrodinger's, uh, uh, health. I know because it's not, he gave me this stuff and it's
2061360	2069200	not going away. Jesus. It's fucking really disturbing. So I had to schedule an appointment
2069200	2074160	from, if you, it sounds almost like a read, the way read instruments make notes. Like if you,
2074160	2078560	if you exhaled hard enough, you might make a nice note. Yeah. Yeah. If I could go really hard.
2079040	2093920	Uh, so anyways, if it doesn't go away, which it clearly isn't, and I go to a follow-up appointment,
2093920	2101040	then I got to get a CAT scan. Yeah. Which is, as we all know, is the thing you get before they
2101040	2108640	tell you you're dying. I was going to make a bad joke. I wouldn't have gotten no applause.
2109600	2112480	What if they gave me a cat, were you going to say, what if they gave you a cat scan and there
2112480	2119440	was a cat in you? I was going to say Schrodinger's cat scan. Wow. That's been our show. Good night,
2119440	2125920	everybody. I think, I don't know how much of that was like, they're like, let's do a bit,
2125920	2130560	but I guarantee the people clapping all thought of that joke too.
2131360	2134400	They're applauding themselves for that one. All right.
2141680	2147760	It's like an HP Lovecraft, like, is a pineal gland. You're going to end up sounding like
2147760	2152480	Tom Waits. Like, are you going to get that? I don't know. I don't know, man. Well, no,
2152560	2156800	because it's not on my vocal cords. It's not. I may end up... So what's it on? Is it in your
2156800	2168640	larynx or what? It's trachea. Trachea. All right. Let's bring out a son of a doctor, Kumail Najiani.
2168640	2184880	Well, I am a son of a doctor. It's very hard to bite my lip back there.
2187360	2194240	On half my family's chosen profession. But your dad's a shrink, right? Yeah. They're also psychopaths.
2194960	2201040	Yeah. They're like, we don't just play God with the body. We play God with the mind.
2202400	2209040	Is he a psychiatrist or a psychologist? Iatrist, psychiatrist. So he's probably experimenting
2209040	2214720	with all kinds of drugs all the time. Yeah. I'm pretty sure he's like sort of furthering Nazi
2214720	2221200	technology. He's got like people under there that he's crossbred with monkeys and stuff like that.
2222160	2226960	He's doing some new shit. I don't know. I don't think my dad has an exciting life. I don't think
2226960	2236880	he's like... First of all, he is... He's a very kind, nice man. And he, I think, genuinely is
2236880	2242880	affected by people being sick around him, which is not good because that's not a good doctor.
2243920	2248800	You don't want a doctor who's crying on the operating table. Oh, fuck this. I hope I get
2248800	2258640	this right. Oh, shit. Why? Why did I choose this? I think it really is like that. I see him be
2258640	2264000	affected by that, but I think he's a psychiatrist and I don't know if he's like dealing with really
2264000	2269600	interesting stuff or anything. Yeah. Does he have like an office downtown? No. Downtown Pakistan?
2270000	2275520	Yeah. Yeah. Pakistan, as you know, is an eight block radius.
2279840	2282000	We just got our second ice cream shop. It's
2284000	2287760	very exciting. We do have seven Starbucks though.
2289440	2294560	That's just a Starbucks joke. Can I ask you guys a question? What do you guys make of these people
2294560	2301040	in the movies and on the TV shows when someone asks them to sit and then they go,
2301040	2308160	I'd rather stand? I don't get those people. That is a very specific beef, my friend.
2309040	2315760	I was just thinking about that. Also, I would say, who tells... I'd like you to sit down for this.
2315760	2320640	Yeah. Who does that first of all? Someone said to you, look at that bridge, you'd be, fuck you.
2320720	2323120	It's like, sit down. You go, now I'm standing.
2324160	2331360	Okay. Yeah. But it's never like that in the movies. It's more like, you're supposed to sit
2331360	2334320	because they want to tell you something you don't want to hear. And then the person's like,
2334320	2340240	I'll do it standing. What kind of conviction is that? Just sit. It's a free seat.
2341520	2346320	How often do you get to sit in this life? I mean, how many battles do you get to fight
2346320	2351280	that you're definitely going to win? That's one of them, right? Oh, okay. This one, I win.
2351280	2356400	Make me sit. Yeah. Next time someone tells me to sit, I'm definitely going, I'd rather stand.
2357040	2360800	Definitely. You know what I always wanted to do in my life is when someone says,
2362320	2370720	are we clear? I want to say crystal. I want to do that. I also want to say game recognize game
2370720	2379040	and like a ironic, gay recognized game. No, game recognize game. People do that. No. It's bad ass.
2379920	2386400	Game recognize game. Like, like, Oh, you're good. I'm good. And we see each other. You know? Yeah.
2387440	2393760	Wait, I don't get it. Like we're both con artists or not, I'm not a game. I mean, game,
2394160	2400000	like you, uh, two, two, two great minds think alike. Yeah. Game recognize game. That's so
2401440	2407280	quick. Wait, wait, wait. Am I not being clear? That did not set you up for Chris.
2409200	2417760	Also, he, he, he doesn't recognize game. No, I, I recognize clunky, clunky, recognize clunky.
2418640	2425840	That is hard to say. Game recognize game. That's a lot of fucking consonants. You guys have heard
2425840	2432560	that, right? That's not a smooth. It's still really stupid. It's really game recognize game.
2432560	2440400	Well, you know why? You guys don't recognize game. I don't think liking that saying has,
2440400	2446560	means you have game. I think that's, that's, that's an absence of games. Like Joshua in war games,
2446640	2451280	like, like, like it makes you sound like a robot. Game recognize game. Yeah. No,
2451280	2455040	it's a conveying an idea with only three words that would take longer than three words to
2455040	2459600	convey. Not even a real sentence. It's caveman language. No, but you're conveying. It doesn't
2459600	2462240	matter if it's a real sentence. What are you conveying? I still don't even understand it.
2462240	2467920	Okay. See, it's so hard. You've got no game, man. Yeah. If I had to explain it to you,
2467920	2473360	you've got, you've got, you've got game, you've got game. So if you've got game and I've got game,
2473680	2481840	recognize game. Also game, game hate verbs or game hate. Yeah. Chacho love recognize. Recognizes a
2481840	2492080	verb motherfucker. But it, uh, Jeff recognize words. Game hate sweat,
2492080	2499040	prepositional phrase. Fire kill mother. I mean, like, I like, are we clear
2499040	2502480	crystal because that sounds film noir. Yeah, that's good. Yeah. Um,
2503360	2508960	let me come up with another three word thing. Oh, uh, uh, vocal cord tumors. Okay.
2509920	2514960	Oh yeah. Okay. Here's one. And by the way, I think you should go to a different doctor.
2518640	2522720	I like, yeah, I like how blossom that was. You got chambers all over your throat. It's no big
2522720	2530400	deal, bro. Hey, I have great news. You have tumors all up in your throat. I have to go home.
2533760	2538400	Game recognize game. I was, I was at the, I may have said this on the show before, but I don't
2538400	2542880	think so. I was at the airport at 10 a.m, uh, at LAX and one of the shitty terminals, because all
2542880	2546880	LAX terminals are the worst. Cause it's not a good airport. I'm from LA. I'm proud of LA,
2546880	2552240	but our airport is shit. And I was at there, it was like nine, 10 a.m and the bar is rammed
2552240	2557280	at 10 a.m. Like there's a million. Somehow it's okay at the airport to get beer with your breakfast
2557280	2562400	at nine a.m. There's no rules. Fuck everything. Airports are for drinking, drinking at an
2562400	2571280	airport. It's crazy. Is it? They have a, they have a, uh, uh, a bar. Well, you're in, in, in, in
2571280	2579280	Europe, like, like, like, like in Ireland, um, you sound like a child right now. Cause I'm excited.
2579280	2584080	There's this bar in Ireland, Europe. Dan, should we, should, should we be sitting down for the
2584080	2590560	stirring? I got a flight out of Dublin. Uh, and, and there's a, there's like a fucking real, it's
2590560	2596240	like a pub, like, like, like it was like across from the gate. Like I was like, I sat and I had a
2596240	2604320	pint. You're like a child trying to, uh, describe Legoland right now. There was, there was this bar
2604320	2610240	and, uh, and they had pints. And they, and they have one and Chicago, props to Chicago, O'Hare.
2611680	2617680	O'Hare is the worst airport in Ireland. No, not true. Not true. But they have a bar there that,
2617680	2624080	while, while, while, a bar in Chicago? No, I've heard everything at the airport. Like, like,
2624080	2627840	here's the problem with most bars now that's in airports, like they fall, they've all become
2627840	2634000	like these like fucking Flanagan Johnson's. They have open at noon, um, closes at 3 p.m. Uh,
2634000	2640080	and then they fucking robots on the, on the bottles so that no one can, that, that infuriates me. Oh,
2640080	2644720	is that right? It can't overpour. And the bartender's like, if you, if you make fun of it,
2645360	2651120	it's like, oh, meet, meet, mop, mop, is that a proper shot? Good job. Logan's run. Like,
2651680	2656800	wait, he got upset at that? The, the bar tenders recognize game.
2660720	2664640	I'm fucking hitting three pointers all night tonight, man. You know what I'm saying? I fucking
2664640	2671680	can't lose. Um, all right. Anyway, whatever the, there's a, there's an airport bar in Chicago.
2671680	2677680	That's like, like, it's goofy. Cause it's like, kind of like, like, uh, is it the all brushed
2677680	2682000	aluminum sports center kind of? No, it's like, it's like a bright white, like, it's like,
2682000	2686880	it's like you're in the Billie Jean video and Michael Jackson has touched all the, everything.
2688240	2695280	Wow. Younger crowd. Uh, by the way, if you guys don't get it, it is a fucking spot on description.
2696080	2701680	That was pretty amazing. Um, but so it's, so in that sense, it's not the place,
2701680	2706560	it's not a place that I would drink at if it was, it was just in Los Angeles, but, but here's the
2706560	2712320	kick. Here's the, here's the thing. No fucking kids, because it's like clearly a grownup place.
2712320	2717440	And so there's not fucking families got like eating their mustard sandwiches with their fucking
2717440	2722320	strollers going like, I can't wait to get the Disney world. And it's like, I'm a fucking
2722320	2730880	alcoholic. Get out of here. Yeah. This is my job. I'm at work right now. It used to be part of the
2730880	2735440	culture. You know, you go to the airport and it's like, Oh, it's the airport. There's no law here.
2735440	2741120	Booze wise. You can't be judged for drinking at 9am because it might be 3pm to you. You might be
2741120	2747040	from Melbourne. That is what it is. People think they can get away with it. And also you're in a,
2747040	2751280	like I was just at Chicago O'Hare and where there's like a Mexican, like there's a big,
2751280	2755040	there's a big food court area and off the side is the Mexican place of really good guacamole.
2755040	2759680	You know this place? And it was, and it was really international. Like, like everybody was from
2759840	2765520	somewhere. It was like an internationally airport. Everybody there was from somewhere like, like,
2765520	2769680	she was from like part of Mexico. She, someone was from Portugal. It wasn't all people from
2769680	2773520	Chicago. No, there were people that were connecting through, but everybody was from somewhere
2773520	2777040	interesting and they were all going to cool places too, because it's, how do you know? Because we all
2777040	2781920	talked. It was 9am. He talks to strangers. He talks to strangers all the time. Your life is like a
2782000	2793200	Stephen King movie without any threat. I'll go for that. I'll go for that. No,
2793200	2799040	it's just random people connecting, but there's no boogins outside to fight. And I forget what
2799040	2802560	terminal in Chicago O'Hare. There's the sporty one. It's kind of shit. It's all brushed aluminum
2802560	2806800	and there's a cranky old fucker that works behind the bar and he's hilarious. And people that go to
2806800	2811040	the airport a lot go to that bar because he's really funny. So you meet a bunch of characters
2811040	2815120	it's like a weird cheers kind of situation. And I actually have met people at that bar in
2815120	2818800	Chicago and gotten their phone numbers and like hung out with them when I came back to town
2818800	2822000	because like, it's a good place. This is not good behavior.
2823600	2827520	You shouldn't be. It's called having a personality. This is not going to hang out and meet people.
2827520	2834320	You talk to people. So anyway, let's get back to my fucking story. So I met LAX 10am, maybe even
2834320	2839120	9am, and we're at the fucking bar and it's absolutely jammed with people. And maybe there
2839200	2842880	was a delay in a flight. So it's just completely rammed. So many interesting people, right? Yeah.
2842880	2846640	Well, I get in there and there's nowhere to sit or to stand. There's no seats at the bar. There's
2846640	2851360	no tables. So I just walk up and think I'll have a beer while I'm getting ready to get in the plane.
2851360	2858800	It's 9am. I have a beer. We're at the airport. And I go up there and I wave down the bartender
2858800	2865680	and he looks at me and he goes, ID! He just yells ID! Jesus Christ. So I take out my ID and I put up
2865680	2869920	in the bar and then he goes away for a while to make a drink. Then he comes back and goes,
2869920	2875040	what do you want? He didn't look at the ID. No, no, no. ID's on the bar. He's got his hand on it
2875040	2879200	and he's looking at me and he goes, what do you want? I go, I'd like a Modelo Speciale. He goes,
2880080	2886000	six dollars. And so I go, okay. And he stands there and waits for me to take the money out.
2886000	2891280	Like he couldn't just go make it. He's standing staring at me with his hand on my ID and I take
2891360	2896080	the money out. And then he takes the money and goes away. He's all angry. It's fucking 9am. He's
2896080	2900320	too busy. And he brings me the beer and there's nowhere to be. So I just stand behind the people
2900320	2904240	at the bar and I start to drink my beer. And he goes, you can't stand when you're drinking here.
2904960	2910880	And I turned to him and said, I can stand it if you can. Which I thought was pretty good for 9am.
2912240	2918960	No fucking laugh at all. I can stand it. Are we clear? Crystal, that's fucking better than that
2918960	2922960	because it was on the fucking fly. Yeah. You can't stand when you're drinking here.
2923520	2929680	I could stand it if you can. No, don't give me your fucking bullshit up live.
2931440	2935680	I thought it was pretty good. For me, the least believable part of the story is that a beer at
2935680	2940080	the airport costs six dollars. Eight, whatever the fuck it was. Eight dollars. So speaking of Chicago,
2940080	2946320	you were in my hometown of Milwaukee. Yeah, I'm in Chicago. I was in Chicago,
2946320	2950400	Minneapolis and Milwaukee. It was great. Was it? Were they a good crowd in Milwaukee? They
2950400	2954560	were an awesome crowd. I asked you, I was like, hey, what's the vibe with the city? And you said,
2955360	2961600	blue collar liberal. Yeah. And yeah, it was awesome. I had a great time. I met Frito.
2962160	2970880	Frito. He did not introduce himself as that. Is it Frito? Well, his name is Frito. F-R-I-E-D-E-L,
2970880	2975760	German name. Okay. But we always called him Frito because it just sounds like Frito.
2975760	2985520	Frito. No, Rob Schwab. I was Schwab yesterday. He told me the story of how he drove you around
2985520	2993040	while you were losing your virginity in the back seat. Well, well, that that actually sounds
2993920	3000320	better. The sad fact is that he would accompany me because I was afraid to
3001280	3008720	navigate the freeway systems of Milwaukee when I was 16, 17, 16. I was like, I don't know how to
3008720	3013840	get to this girl's apartment without getting lost. So he would come with me because he was more grown
3013840	3023920	up than me at our age. And I rewarded him for his partnership by letting him sit in the girl's
3023920	3028720	living room and watch TV while I would make out with her in her bedroom. And then what about the
3028720	3035120	family? Well, do you mean the kid, her kid that was in a crib next to the bed where we were making out?
3035120	3043760	You know, sometimes just like a little physical detail in the story opens up the whole afternoon.
3044640	3050960	Yeah. Yeah. Picture a crib with a baby in it and then me making out with the mother of the child.
3050960	3058080	And then above on the wall above us is a dot matrix printed banner for new kids on the block.
3060240	3063680	Wow. That just said new kids on the block. It actually said, I heart Jordan Knight.
3065280	3071680	Every detail of this story made me sadder. Wait, she printed that out for herself. And that's in
3071680	3078880	the nursery that she loves Jordan Knight. Yeah. How old? She was like 20, I think. Oh, okay. Yeah.
3078880	3082080	Old enough to know better. That's how I wrote. I didn't know what I wanted. I didn't know if I
3082080	3087520	wanted a woman old enough that how her having a baby wasn't like kind of a bummer or, but then
3087520	3093920	the NKOTB thing, that's what I'm calling it. That would have been a bummer. So there's no good age
3093920	3098880	for that. No, unless she was like, it was like, you know, Susan Sarandon. And I was like, you know,
3098880	3103040	coming. Why does she like, why does she like new kids on the block? Then that's, oh, that'd be
3103040	3108480	weird. Well, maybe there's no baby would like it. Yeah. That is the banner. So for poor Frito,
3109600	3114400	not only would he like wing man me or whatever you call that, like sat in the living room and
3114400	3118720	like, well, what we would make out chauffeur when it, when it finally came time for me to
3119280	3122480	discard my maidenhood.
3128480	3133680	Hey, you're not being very crystal right now. What do you mean? Discard your maidenhood.
3133680	3134640	Loses virginity.
3137680	3141040	Wait, I was trying, I was trying to come up with Fraser talk for losing my virginity.
3141040	3146560	Maidenhood. Yeah. Well, whatever. Okay. All right. I was saying it was a, it was a bit.
3146640	3155200	Assholes. So it was with the same. Donahue. All right. Sorry. Donahue. Donahue was a show.
3157520	3162720	I read the time that the Billie Jean video was playing. Yeah. Right after.
3162720	3165520	He was our Ricky Lake. Okay. There was this girl, Ricky Lake.
3169200	3174640	Was it the same lady you were like dating a lady? The, uh, who Ricky Lake? No.
3175600	3180640	You were dating this 20 year old lady dating. Yeah. Hooking up. You were how old? You were
3180640	3185600	younger than her. How did you meet her online? But it wasn't really, yeah,
3185600	3193920	it wasn't really called online yet. It was like a modem chat room. Yeah. Was she a babe?
3194480	3200080	She was, I met a lot of good looking, uh, uh, young ladies. Uh, but, but, but like, like,
3200080	3207200	yeah, I never, like considering the possibilities, you know, could have easily, you know, you're,
3207200	3211520	you're chatting with someone that's saying, I'm a, I'm an 18 year old, let's get meet up in real
3211520	3216160	life. Like considering how the many ways that could have gone. I was very lucky. So she lived
3216160	3220480	in Milwaukee. You lived in Milwaukee. Um, yeah. And so Frito, you would have a friend of yours
3220480	3224640	drive you because you didn't like navigating the mean streets. I just didn't even know how I was
3224640	3230400	just like, and I, and I, and it's barely different now. It just has GPS now. The, the highways, Milwaukee,
3230400	3236080	your own manhood, so much going on. Yeah. So I, when I came to, I made it virginity. This is just
3236080	3243520	to say how cool Frito is. Frito didn't drive me around while I did it in the backseat. We drove
3243520	3248400	to under the home bridge in Milwaukee. It was the dead of winter. She didn't want to fuck by the
3248400	3255520	baby. Is that what it was? Well, her mom had come home the night that we did it. Her mom came home
3255520	3263600	and was angry because she had found out that that the girl had taped back together a check
3263600	3269360	for the new kids on the block fan club that that the mother had ripped up because she hadn't done
3269360	3275200	some chore or something. So the girl, the daughter had, the daughter had taped it back together,
3275200	3282080	sent it to the new kids on the block and they cashed it because they saw the writing on the wall.
3282080	3287280	What was, what was it? They were like, what was the amount in sync is coming. What was the amount
3287280	3291440	on that check? It was like a fucking dollar. I think it was literally a dollar. What does that
3291440	3297200	dollar buy you? I don't know. A more printer, uh, ink. I don't know. I really don't know. That is
3297200	3301840	kind of the story. But so they got in this big, big drunken fight and the mom like pulled out a
3301840	3307040	steak knife and was like, and I was like in my acrylic sweater with my rat tail and my,
3307920	3311440	my earring and my pimples going like, Hey, cool down, man.
3314160	3321600	You guys are mother and daughter. You love each other, man. And it was so romantic that
3321600	3331120	it is not my son. And so for it to reward me for my valor, I, we went under the home bridge
3331120	3335360	and you knew it was for this. She was like, listen, you stood up for me against my mom.
3335360	3340480	I'm going to take your maidenhood. Yeah. She basically, that was the deal. Like seriously,
3340480	3345600	she was like, let's go get this guy. I think it was really like kind of like, this is you losing
3345600	3350560	your virginity, this story. Yeah. So you'd been working out. You'd been making out with her.
3350560	3352880	And you guys hadn't had sex yet. Right. And then it was like,
3352880	3357520	this was, I mean, it was just a culmination of now there was an emotional crisis. And yeah,
3357520	3362720	it was like, let's go. Let's go somewhere. I'm hard as a fucking diamond right now.
3363600	3371760	So, so Frito, this is all just a story that I'm just telling you how cool Frito is. So for fucking
3371760	3383280	Frito hung out in the fucking snow and ice in Milwaukee while I, in my fire, my mom's firebird.
3383280	3388000	Jesus Christ. You know, I like that the firebird is the most shocking detail.
3389680	3393440	Everything is any, any specific detail from now on, it's going to make it only worse.
3394400	3398240	I mean, I told this story a lot before I guess it's, it's the, the ending is even more amazing
3398240	3403760	because all I remember is the date of mom. Yeah. Yeah. They had sex with her. I used a condom
3403760	3410800	because I'm, I'm a classy, responsible gentleman. And it finished and I had the condom and I like,
3410800	3415200	I didn't know what to do with it. First condom first used condom. I didn't have a little bag.
3415200	3419520	You never masturbate into a condom before you let's get back to that one.
3422480	3424720	We're going to table that one until after dance.
3429040	3432320	That reminded me of that play that toys movie with Robin Williams,
3432320	3435760	when someone goes like, it's floating fake poop, you know, for the bathtub.
3437040	3438720	And then a guy goes, come on, we've all done it.
3440560	3441600	And everyone looks at them.
3444560	3446320	We all shit in the tub sometimes.
3455760	3457120	Camille's blushing right now.
3458720	3465520	So anyways, I took, which takes a lot. There was a, I believe it was called a moon roof on the car,
3465520	3468720	which has a sunroof that doesn't really open all the way. It just kind of props open
3469760	3478880	about 20 degrees. And, and so I, I very gracefully like went, you took the condom and like,
3478880	3482880	I had to, I chucked it backwards, like out the, out the opening of the moon roof,
3483840	3487280	dead a winter. So freedom, freedom, freedom. Come back in from the snow.
3487280	3491360	Fucking, uh, friends forever. Where is he? Where is he huddled in a ditch?
3491360	3496160	Like he was actually like, we, he was with a friend of the girls. Like we, we, we, we,
3496160	3501600	the girl, my girl, uh, uh, got him a girl, like, like her friend was from work.
3501600	3503200	Was he making out with this other girl?
3503200	3505840	I don't know if they were making out. Maybe they're just chatting and smoking.
3505840	3508560	I don't know if he got anywhere with her or not. I can't remember.
3508560	3513520	It's snowing out, right? Like it's, uh, yeah. And so Fredo get back in and we take everybody
3513520	3520640	home and thank you very much. I got school tomorrow. I go, I drive, I drive the firebird
3520640	3526240	into the garage. I get out. I go, I tip toe inside. I go to sleep. I get, I get up in the
3526240	3533280	morning, go out to the cold garage, just the sub-zero garage and, and they're frozen to the roof.
3534080	3540960	But also like, like fucking like amazingly, like a, like frozen in a wind sock kind of like,
3541520	3546000	like it wasn't like a crumpled up thing. It was like, it had, it had somehow like,
3546000	3552080	yeah, the wind had like stretched it and like, like, like, like, like, like a temple tail,
3552080	3556320	you know, it'd been whipping in the wind probably. And then slowly like froze. Yeah.
3556800	3563920	Just like, like this, this, this, this, this, you know, uh, this like, uh, green antenna.
3564720	3568720	Yeah. It's a flag memorializing your spent maidenhood.
3570720	3572960	And I just looked at the camera and said, it's a living.
3576000	3580400	I rushed out so lucky. Nobody else saw that first. Your mom didn't come down.
3580400	3586320	Yeah. But what would she do? She would, she, she wouldn't touch it. She'd be like,
3586320	3588480	what's this? And I would go, mom,
3591840	3595280	that's it. What do you think my gun to your head, mom? What do you think?
3598320	3603200	I was like, when, when my mom found, uh, weed in my clothes pocket, I was home from,
3603760	3608960	like, I came home to do my laundry, uh, like a good 20 year old 2020 early twenties guy.
3609040	3613840	And, uh, my mom was like going through my laundry. Like I, I found,
3613840	3617360	pulled out this baggie from one of my pockets. What's this? And I said,
3617360	3620320	that's what you get for going through laundry.
3627680	3633360	Now, you know, I'll explain the condom thing. Okay. I mean,
3633360	3644880	if your whole life, the only way you've come is with feeling your own hand every now and then
3644880	3650160	you want to feel something else. So I would sometimes wear a condom because it would,
3650160	3655280	it feels different because it was lubricated. Yeah. Lubricated. I'm not a monster.
3657360	3660640	I'm sure. I'm sure I've tried it. I don't recall, but I guarantee you.
3661360	3666960	I did a pretty high concept in my time. We, you think I remember, like, I remember, I remember
3666960	3670160	putting one on cause I was like, holy shit, that's a condom. I've never pulled it out.
3670160	3674800	Great. I remember putting a condom on and being like, this feels as good as sex feels at bat.
3676960	3684400	I was wrong. That was way more. You had a really good condom. Yeah. It was, you know, too tight.
3684400	3691600	What do you want me to say? Let's bring out condom expert Spencer Crittenden.
3702160	3709200	Hey guys, what's up? Hey Spencer. That's a snazzy podium, man. It's a Dharma. It's a lost podium.
3710160	3717200	I'm into it. It's from, um, there's a bunch of props from the lost TV show in at meltdown.
3717200	3722560	And this is obviously one of them from the lost TV show. Yeah. The desk in there,
3722560	3727040	if that's the same one is from the set and it has Dharma logo all over it.
3727040	3731200	The desk in there. And this is also a Dharma thing. This is also like a Dharma logo has a
3731200	3737440	guy in the center of it that has Mickey mouse ears on. Yeah. It's surrounded by like the E Ching shit.
3738320	3742720	Hmm. You don't know lost, I guess. I know. I know what you're talking about with Dharma,
3742720	3747360	but those, the symbol with those sticks being radiated, like in an eight, like an octogram,
3747360	3752880	that's a, that's like also an E Ching sort of thing. The book of changes. Book of changes.
3752880	3760800	Nothing. No big deal. It's like a vocal tumor. So, you know, you guys, this is my hundredth
3760800	3771040	episode on this podcast syndication, baby. I don't want to be shitty, but it's not really
3771040	3776560	the hundredth episode because you have missed some in the middle. Uh, yeah. So, you know,
3776560	3784640	my hundredth episode being on the podcast. I think very intense days. You were on the fifth one.
3785600	3790480	Huh? Yeah. Yeah. The podcast. How many episodes did we do before we started recording these?
3790480	3795040	Any idea? No, not me. Well, there's actually, we're, we're finding that out right now. Digging
3795040	3800480	through the old, we, we, we recorded them, but never intended to podcast them, uh, for a couple
3800480	3806000	of episodes that we're digging up now and we're editing them a little bit for, um, for a kind of
3806000	3817120	box set that we're going to offer people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do your throat thing one more time.
3817120	3828080	Wait. It sounds like your stomach is growling out of your throat.
3829520	3833440	Are you concerned about this? Then is this a cause for alarm? Well, he went to the doctor.
3833440	3838320	Yeah. Was the doctor concerned? Well, doctors are not concerned about people.
3838320	3842080	The most horrible shit that day. They've seen someone with a cancer that's going to kill them
3842080	3846400	that day. I actually had an appointment. I, I, I'm 40 now. I had an appointment to go to a doctor
3846400	3854960	and get my actual 40 physical and maybe get the old, uh, uh, up the, uh, like, like, yeah. But then
3854960	3858160	I had, then I had to go out of town. So I missed it, but have you done that? Wait, what is that?
3859200	3862240	When they put the finger up for the prostate cancer. Oh yeah. Well, I guided that. You know
3862240	3866400	what you should do when he puts the finger up and gets to the prostate, look at him like eyes and
3866400	3880800	go game recognize game. I'm going to say I can stand it if you can. Crystal. Can you feel my
3880800	3891440	finger up your ass? Crystal. Crystal. I went, I went to a guy for my heartburn that my doctor
3891440	3897920	sent me, gave me a referral to a specialist for heartburn. I went in, the guy told me to take off
3897920	3904960	my pants and lay down sideways on the table and he put on a glove and he said, he said some blue
3904960	3911360	comment like, uh, like this is gonna, uh, uh, this is gonna fuck a little bit. Like, like, like, I
3911360	3916720	tell, he had some line he had written, like, like I tell everyone, uh, just relax. Although I'd be
3916720	3922320	surprised if you could, uh, something like that. And I'm like, again, so this, and he put his finger
3922320	3926800	at my ass and he's feeling around and he goes like, oh no, no internal hemorrhoids. Uh, everything's
3926800	3933520	fine. Everything's great in here. And I'm thinking, first of all, wrong. Uh, you don't even know
3933520	3939200	everything about my ass. I have, I have a fucking hemorrhoid. I like to beat the band. Um, second
3939200	3945920	of all, what part of heartburn don't you understand? What's going on? Why is there a finger in my ass?
3947040	3948000	Chest hurts.
3951920	3952960	The way to a man's heart.
3957120	3964160	God, I fucking can't lose tonight. This is really my night. And then he gave me a prescription of
3964160	3968480	something that I never actually went and got. No, he gave me, he gave me another referral to a
3968480	3972800	different guy. I was like, I'm not doing this anymore. It's like fire in the sky. I want you
3972800	3976800	to go see my friend Tony. He lives in West Hollywood. Yeah. I was like, I tell, I tell,
3976800	3982240	give him the, give him this note. Don't open it. Yeah. Yeah. And then I go to Tony and Tony's
3982240	3990320	like reading or like, Hey, come downstairs. Lay down sideways. Yeah. It's the side medically
3990320	3997520	trained. He's called me doctor. Wow. What could possibly, what could you possibly find a value
3997520	4004160	in there about my heartburn? It's all part of the same gastrointestinal. It's all, we're all
4004160	4010880	the same thing. Your mouth is a direct line to your butt. I know that, but, but it's my mouth's
4010880	4016800	closer to where it hurts. Like, and the butt is where the poop comes out. Yeah. But maybe
4016800	4022640	something's getting happening in there and it's like moving shit back up. Like I put bad food up
4022640	4028800	my butt. Like, no, like bad food got maybe stuck close to your butt. And we'll be right back. The
4028800	4034000	beginnings. This is the beginnings of medicine, by the way. Like maybe some bad food got stub
4034560	4040000	up your butt on the way out your butt and it's causing, it's sending a signal to your way. Your
4040000	4044560	heartburn is happening. We gotta, we gotta have shrub on here. Sorry. Another hand comes up and
4044560	4049600	I'm very fascinated about this. This is probably called, called loss of opportunity. Loss of
4049600	4056560	opportunity? Yeah. It's something legal, you know, if you've got prostate cancer and the guy
4056560	4065200	doesn't examine a year or two from now, we fucked up. Oh, so you were saying that maybe heartburn
4065200	4070800	and one of the symptoms of prostate cancer is heartburn. So he had, that's not what you're saying.
4073440	4076880	Come up here and get a mic if you're going to talk for a bit. I'm curious about this.
4076880	4081120	You're saying it's a legal thing. Like, oh, I went to a guy for heartburn two years ago and now I
4081120	4085360	got prostate cancer and he should have put a finger at my butt. Yeah. There's a microphone.
4086800	4091680	You see. Yeah. Total pro. Great move.
4095600	4099040	All right. Now wisdom.
4099040	4111360	Okay. So if you get prostate cancer and two years from now you're really fucked up
4111360	4117760	and no doctor has seen it and they check your, they check your records and they see that you
4117760	4123920	went to a doctor two years ago then and that he could have examined you and he didn't.
4124880	4130000	Is this specifically about prostate cancer or like any sort of, or is this like a prostate
4130000	4134320	cancer? If you go into a doctor, you have a chipped tooth or a sore throat and they don't
4134320	4138160	put a finger up your butt. They could be sued for malpractice or malfeasance or something.
4138160	4143040	Yeah. Just kind of fucked up because, you know, American medicine. I have two questions. What's
4143040	4151120	your name, sir? Helder. Helder. What do you do? I study medicine. You study medicine? Yeah. Oh,
4151200	4157360	good. Oh, you're going to be a doctor. So, yeah. So, and it all started with you being fascinated
4157360	4163760	by like dead animals and stuff, right? And your dad was like, don't be a serial killer,
4163760	4169760	go to medical school. No, no, actually I'm not from here. You know, I'm from Brazil and there,
4169760	4178160	you know, starting all doctors are assholes, major assholes, letting me get this out of the way.
4178960	4184400	So, no. What sort of medicine do you want to practice? I really don't know. Maybe a radiology,
4184400	4189360	but radiology is the cushy one. That's why there's no emergencies. My cousin is a radiologist.
4189360	4193760	You make a lot of money. There's no emergencies. The hours are easy. You just just sort of look
4193760	4200080	in at x-rays and like texts, like lab stuff. And you're constantly exposed to radiation.
4200080	4206480	Listen, which can't hurt. I mean, as the old saying goes, radiation can't hurt.
4207440	4212320	So, so are you saying, just to be clear, this loss of opportunity concept,
4212960	4217520	it's not even like, like, like Jeff said, if it was, if I went in with a broken pinky,
4217520	4220720	is that, is that true? Or is it because it had to do with my, my
4220720	4223680	It didn't have to do with your harpoon, you know.
4223680	4230320	But so I just got a spot check. Yeah. Well, I've been to a doctor and that hasn't happened.
4230320	4234080	So why does, why doesn't that happen every time you go to a doctor? You're saying doctors live
4234080	4240400	in fear of not diagnosing prostate cancer. Yeah, it's kind of weird, you know, but I really don't
4240400	4245920	know exactly why. You know, that's one thing that could happen. I guess they're just playing the odds.
4245920	4250960	Like, by the way, you sound already sound like a doctor. I don't know exactly. I mean, that could
4251680	4254960	just give me a number doc. Tell me how long have I got?
4254960	4258720	That's why I didn't say anything when you were complaining about you.
4260160	4262640	What do you think it is? I have no fucking idea.
4266720	4267760	How long have you studied medicine? How long have you studied medicine? How long have you studied
4267760	4269200	medicine? How long have you studied medicine? How long have you studied medicine? How long have you
4269200	4274800	six years, six years? What school do you go to? What did you go to? In Brazil, I studied in the
4274800	4280080	federal university. Do you live in Elena? Are you just really, you left Brazil during the World Cup?
4280640	4286640	Yeah. It's probably a good time to go, right? Yeah. Yeah. You're just visiting Los Angeles. Is that
4286640	4290080	what you said? Yeah. Oh, okay. So you thought like, fuck it. It's a good time to get out of here with
4290080	4294960	all the, all the, all the tourists are here and stuff. Yeah. What town are you from? Rio. Rio. Yeah.
4294960	4299440	Yeah. So that's probably a good time to be not, not at home right now. Yeah. Rio's complete chaos.
4300080	4302880	How do you feel about, because like all the civil unrest and stuff like that,
4302880	4304880	because there was riots leading up to the world. Oh, he's pro.
4304880	4313120	Well, I think like historically, lots of, lots of cities, like the local population loses a lot.
4313120	4317360	Like the working class loses a lot. It's a bunch of grafts from the top and corporations and bit
4317360	4322640	like contractors get bids and stuff like that. Uh, does the average person in Rio hate the,
4322640	4327120	the World Cup? Are they happy that it's there? Yeah. Well, now that it's, it is happening,
4327120	4332880	people are, you know, kind of okay with it because, you know, Brazil's plain and crazy.
4332960	4338640	Fucking bullshit. I have a, I have a World Cup question. I also, I also have one. Are you,
4338640	4344640	you found a football? Not really. Okay. He's here. Why is the logo two hands?
4344640	4353360	Hands are like the worst thing in soccer. Yeah. Soccer. The hate hangs. That would be like if
4353360	4361840	the hockey logo was like roller skates. The story of it. Or if a football logo was a chess board.
4363200	4366400	That, that trophy now, there's, there's a good documentary about the trophy. Now it's like,
4366400	4369360	it's the world, which is the soccer ball, which is the hands all holding onto it.
4369360	4373680	That's not the original one. The original one was like stolen and Hitler wanted it and Mussolini
4373680	4378320	stole it for a while. Like there was an amazing story about like the original trophy, which is
4378320	4384720	this beautiful piece of like art deco, art gold, and it was really wonderful. And it was probably
4384720	4389120	the most coveted trophy that will ever be because it was first of all, beautiful. And second of all,
4389120	4393040	it's the world cup, which is the most important thing for most, you know, like athletes. And it
4393040	4397760	got, and we don't know where it is, but for a while, Mussolini had it and Hitler tried to steal it and
4397760	4405360	shit like that. It's really good. Hitler, Hitler loved art. I saw that movie. He was going to build
4405360	4410400	a big Hitler museum with all the art and all the world in it. Is this the John Cusack one or?
4411360	4415440	Monuments, man. John Cusack. I can't even remember. Yeah. Everyone was in it. No,
4415440	4420000	George Clooney. George Clooney. What's the one with young Hitler? Oh, that is. That's called
4420000	4425520	Max. Or wait, what is it called? Max. Yeah. That was, I told you on this podcast, I recommend
4425520	4432880	viewing that because it's like very dramatic. Like it's, I don't know. I didn't, I don't think
4432880	4436640	it's trying. I don't think you can make a movie about Hitler and not have it be dramatic. But it's
4436640	4441520	like, I mean, if you want to see John Cusack pointing at a guy poking him in the chest and
4441520	4448640	saying, from your heart, Hitler, I want to see it on the canvas, Hitler. It's just funny.
4449440	4455520	He's like, the world will be my canvas. Yeah. I have a football question. What?
4456640	4462080	Do you guys know what he did? Too soon, man. The story ends badly. Yeah.
4463680	4466800	The other question, Spencer and I were talking about this on Twitter.
4466800	4473440	Okay. The hardest thing about watching football is a soccer or is that you don't know how,
4474560	4478160	at 90 minutes, the game is not over. At 90 minutes, they're like, now we're going to play
4478160	4487360	for a random amount of time. As long as I feel. It's not random. Why don't they just pause the
4487360	4492240	clock and then, so that it's always 90. That's what all the other sports are doing. Why is the
4492240	4496480	time going when they're fucking around, when they're pretending to be hit? They don't want
4496480	4499440	to stop the clock. They don't want to, if you stop the clock, like today, they stop. You got to
4499440	4505680	use your hands. No, don't. That's what I'm saying. That's why they can't, you can't stop the clock.
4508000	4513920	They hate hands. Each time there's an injury, there's a guy trying to kick a clock and it
4513920	4517600	won't work. It's going to make a foot cut. How hard it is to work a stopwatch with your feet.
4517600	4524640	Yeah. That's the best explanation I've heard. For why they don't just pause the fucking clock.
4524640	4528480	Today, during Mexico, Netherlands, they stopped the clock for a water break because it was like
4528480	4532320	97 degrees or whatever, and they stopped it for the second time. So they can't do it. They know how
4532320	4536480	to. The second time in World Cup history, they stopped it for a water break, for a refreshments
4536480	4540560	break, and they went to commercial. It was really a bummer because the one thing that you can dig
4540560	4545120	about, soccer or international football, is that you don't see a bunch of fucking commercials.
4545120	4549440	They had a water break and they went to commercial and it was a big drag. Why don't they just hit
4549440	4555280	pause? It's not why. Then we know when the game's over. The players are playing like,
4555280	4560080	we have a random amount of time left to score. Wouldn't it be better if they knew exactly how
4560080	4568560	much time they had left? Why? Why would it be worse if they knew exactly how much time they had left?
4573920	4578080	There's a lot of corruption in soccer. There's a lot of corruption in soccer is how this
4578080	4584080	explanation is starting. FIFA's like Chicago politics from the 1800s. We don't have to go
4584080	4589120	so far back. There's three different things. One is to see like how bad of a person you are,
4589120	4593600	how bad of a team you are, because there seems like Italy, they just flop around and they lay around.
4593600	4598320	This has nothing to do with the questions. No, no, it does with the clock. Okay. Yeah,
4598320	4602880	they like ham it up and like they waste time. If you notice 90 minutes and people can just go,
4602880	4606240	okay, we're ahead by two goals. We're just going to eat up the clock and lay on the ground or do
4606240	4610240	a bunch of shit. Now the referee says, no, you want to lay on the ground, you lay on the ground,
4610240	4615600	then we can, then we can, uh, yeah, but I don't know. For me, it's, it is a weird thing. There's
4615600	4624400	no other sport. That's like the game will end when it ends. Who the fuck knows? I think there's
4624400	4628160	about five minutes left. There was a piece. I think, I think it was New York times, something
4628160	4632480	like that. I saw that, that, uh, ranked the countries by how much time they spend on the
4632480	4636160	ground writhing in fake agony. And it's so interesting that, uh, but with the team that
4636160	4640480	won today that beat, uh, Mexico, the Netherlands, they weren't even in the top 20. I don't think
4640480	4644640	like there's certain teams that just do not flop and don't spend time writhing around on the ground.
4644640	4650080	Brazil, number one, because they, they, they, South American teams, Central American teams,
4650080	4654160	and also parts of like, like the Spanish leagues, Italian leagues. There's a big culture of just
4654160	4659360	fucking like, like there's a great thing on YouTube or that's, uh, people doing flops and
4659440	4666480	they have like a crosshairs, like a sniper. And people go falling down, but there's a crosshairs
4666480	4670480	and a bullet. The sound goes off, but there's no one anywhere near them. It's really good.
4671280	4676240	Okay. So, so because they flop, that's just another aspect of the game, right? Is what you're
4676240	4680560	saying. It's like its own kind of, no, but I don't get what that has to do with the plot.
4680960	4684960	I mean, you, you have actual injuries that happen in soccer and stuff. That's why,
4684960	4687360	that's why you have that extra time. That's why it's added on.
4688000	4691760	But why don't they just pause when the injuries happen? Because then I think people would like,
4691760	4695840	would use, uh, there's not, the ball's really never dead. Like there's not like a lot of dead
4695840	4698560	ball situations like in basketball where the whistle blows and there's lots of breaks and
4698560	4702480	everyone has a drink, a drink of water. In soccer, you just play, you keep going.
4702640	4706000	There's no, it's fucking amazing. If you watch NBA or college
4706000	4708880	and for the last few minutes, it's nothing but commercials. There's no commercial.
4708880	4712160	No, it's great. But why don't they just pause the clock? They don't have to,
4714000	4718400	that's a false dichotomy. You don't, you don't, the alternative isn't,
4718400	4722480	I guess we're going to have to buy a lot of commercials and shove them into these breaks.
4723120	4727760	Like that's, I'm not even saying breaks. When someone falls down, you play for 45 minutes.
4727760	4731360	And if there's been an injury or if there's been lots of substitutions, they had 30 seconds for
4731440	4735200	this, a minute for that. And they added up and, and nobody knows what that number is.
4736240	4741360	The official is one guy, the fourth official saying that we're going to give you 30 seconds
4741360	4745600	for the substitution. 30 seconds for this penalty kick a minute for that. The officials know, but
4746320	4750240	game not recognize clock. Wow.
4750240	4755760	Wow. World's best callback.
4757760	4761760	Yeah, that was sitting on that egg. Yeah, that was a warm number of callbacks.
4763120	4766720	So, uh, uh, uh, uh, Dr. Toomer is raising his hand.
4770880	4775680	FIFA doesn't embrace change. It took him quite a while to embrace goal line technology.
4775680	4778480	Goal line technology. For your free. Okay.
4778560	4782960	Are you guys talking about? You just walked in, sir.
4784560	4791520	I saw you walk in. We're at a show. Okay. So you had to get up and get a drink when
4791520	4794720	we're doing the show wrong because you came back in and we're talking about soccer. Not to your
4794720	4800560	liking. You're talking about it wrong. Who's this? Who's this fancy gentleman? And then
4801120	4804000	it's the guy in a linen suit. I know. I know he likes to drink.
4804000	4813600	Yes. In the front row, you're right. Well, there, there can, there can be only one.
4815600	4816720	No, I've got screen.
4818240	4823040	That was my only condom virginity. My couch virginity.
4824480	4830080	Which is just me fucking. We were watching. What was your cantaloupe virginity? How old are you?
4830080	4835920	You were doing the first cantaloupe you fucked. Huh? Are we talking honeydew watermelon?
4836800	4843520	Cantaloupe. Cause I was like, oh, honey, dear God. We were watching a documentary about this church
4843520	4848320	quiz that these kids do. And there was all these Christian teens are talking about that. One of
4848320	4853840	them was saying, I know I haven't kissed a boy yet, but I lost my hand. Ginnity, uh, two years ago.
4853840	4858880	And Aaron and I thought we're like, Aaron was so, but she's like, he, he won't let you kiss
4858880	4864320	somebody. He made you jerk them off in a car. Like what kind of fucked up shit? And it was like,
4864320	4868480	it was 10 minutes later that we figured out that she meant the masturbation. No,
4868480	4878240	that she held holding hands with a boy. That's fucking disturbing. We immediately thought she
4878240	4888240	meant my hand. Anyway. So speaking of Aaron, she's not here tonight. Uh, Helder, would you be
4888240	4893040	willing to play, do you ever listen to the podcast? If you listen to us play Dungeons and Dragons,
4894880	4899360	no, but you've, have you heard us play it? Like, like you can, okay. Uh, you're a doctor. You'll
4899360	4905680	figure it out. Uh, Aaron's, Aaron's at a party celebrating the, uh, I think the, the, the new
4905680	4912480	season of drunk history, which she's a part of her episode is, uh, got, uh, uh, John Lithgow and
4912560	4919360	Chris Parnell and Winona Ryder. I haven't seen it, but I'm really looking forward to it. It's, uh,
4919360	4925360	it's a Benedict Arnold. Uh, she tells a story about Benedict Arnold. Uh, and I, I, I heard
4925360	4932400	that, which I think she was telling me weird L Yankovic plays Hitler. That's great. Somebody,
4932400	4936480	somebody tells a story about Hitler and weird L Yankovic. Does he have, does he cut his hair
4936480	4939520	off or is he? That's what I asked. And then Aaron mocked me and said, you know, they have these
4939520	4943360	things, uh, called wigs. And I was like, you can't make long hair into short hair with a wig.
4943360	4947680	And she said, yes, you can. And I, he's got too much hair to put a fucking like, like a Hitler
4947680	4951600	hair on. Yeah. You can't just put it like, maybe he cut it. Maybe that'll be weird L's new look.
4951600	4957200	Cause he kind of, he, he kind of never went back from his quiet John, uh, hair. Like, you know,
4957200	4962080	he kind of did that. And then he was like, he kind of had John. Wasn't it? Am I quiet on gin? Oh, okay.
4962080	4966160	I don't know. Anyways, whatever. She's not here. We're replacing her with a,
4966160	4969440	Spencer, will you hand us out the, or Dan, you want to pass down the character sheets?
4970560	4975120	Yeah. Yeah. I am kind of interested in finding out why that guy was saying we were talking
4975120	4978800	about it wrong. He didn't like to hear about sports. He was, he seems like bad news to me.
4980640	4982640	Maybe we were using our hands too much.
4986480	4991440	But I will say, I did also wonder why we were talking about soccer for like 30 minutes.
4991440	4995360	I fucking like soccer. How about that? Also, I bet, I bet some douche bag. I bet a guy a
4995360	5000800	hundred dollars because I bet a guy a hundred bucks on the Mexico, Netherlands game. I never
5000800	5004000	bet on sports. I'll never do it again. Cause it was stupid. I don't, I don't, I'm not rooting
5004000	5008800	against Mexico, but this guy was just being an asshole. So I bet him I didn't get his name and
5008800	5013120	I'll never see him again. I have no idea who it was. And I guarantee you, did you meet him at an
5013120	5018720	airport? If you were at an airport, you would have gotten his phone. You've never just, you've
5018720	5021520	never met people at a bar. You've never just struck up conversation with people. I've never
5021520	5024960	just talked to random people. If people start talking to me, I'm like, what the fuck do you
5024960	5032960	want? I don't have it. When people ask me anything, I don't have it. You meet interesting people at
5032960	5036400	bars and especially at airport bars because people are coming and going. And it's very
5036400	5043280	fascinating to me. I agree. I agree. If somebody starts chatting me up, I won't, I won't like
5043280	5047600	cold shoulder him at a, uh, you know, in public, but, uh, but yeah, I don't, I don't, I don't,
5047600	5051840	Emily will do this like on an airplane. She has this rule, but she wants, so it was me,
5051840	5055920	it was me in the aisle, her in the middle and the person at the, this old lady at the window.
5055920	5060880	And this, we sat down and she's like, you have to right away establish what the tone is going to be.
5060880	5065840	So this lady looked at Emily and was like, uh, where are you going? And Emily just sat there
5065840	5072560	stone face and the old lady asked her three times and Emily just like fucking bitter lip and was
5072560	5080160	like, I'm going to power through this said nothing. And it was a great flight. Not for that lady.
5081200	5087360	Who gives a fuck what the old lady wants? I do. Okay. Well then take the middle seat from Emily
5087360	5093920	and get a phone number. Get Emily's phone number. Have you? Yeah, I'll give you Emily.
5096080	5100880	You guys don't strike him conversation. I mean, you're the problem. You're that guy. No, no, no,
5101840	5105680	on a flight, on a flight. I don't want jibber jabber. I don't want, I don't want to be like,
5105680	5110400	Hey, so where are you doing on the plane? I want absolute fucking graveyard silence on a flight.
5110400	5114240	Okay. Good. But like, if you're at the fucking airport bar, like, like, I'm like, you just going,
5114240	5119200	so where are you going? Like, you don't do that. But sometimes conversation comes up and you find
5119200	5125440	out that people are just having a good old time. Yeah. Yeah. See, yeah. So some people are curious
5125440	5129360	about the people sitting next to them. I said, and also I could not care less,
5131040	5136400	but you're a comedian. Wouldn't you benefit from, from mining, like, you know, like
5136400	5140480	human experiences? Yeah. No, I talked to a guy once and I got three hours of material out of it.
5143120	5150240	You're a sociopath, sociopath at the ones who, I'm not saying you go up there and you grab
5150240	5153200	everybody's ass that sits next to you and you fucking harangue. I'm like, well, sometimes
5153200	5158800	conversation starts and I actively block them. I swat away attempts at conversation. A hundred
5158800	5163840	percent seem like, you know, you're, you're a very garrulous like chatty guy, but not with
5163840	5169040	fucking people. I don't know. Yeah. Like helder, you're a great guy. If you stand up next to me
5169040	5174000	and we're like, what's up? I would like just fucking stare straight in front of me until you
5174000	5185040	left. He wouldn't say it. See, great. I don't get it. I mean, look, I, my girlfriend Scottish,
5185040	5187520	we went to Scotland, she kept accusing. She's like, Jeff, when you go to Scotland,
5187520	5191040	you can't just go out there and be Jeff Davis and say, hello, how do you do to every fucking person?
5191040	5196080	Like, so they'll fucking hate you. I'm like, they're going to love me. And then I was walking
5196080	5200320	down the fucking street Christmas day or Christmas Eve day and walking down the road and I see her
5200320	5205840	father outside and I see him. I'm leaving. I want to go buy, get Kate a little gift and have
5205840	5209600	breakfast on my own. And I come back and I see him talking to a dude and he's talking to a buddy
5209600	5214480	of his, a small town outside of Edinburgh and they're talking. So I see him and he goes, hey,
5214480	5217520	Jeff, what are you up to? And I'm like, oh, I used to, I did this, I did that. And there's a guy
5217520	5223360	standing like right the foot away from me. And he and Andy, her dad and I were talking for a while.
5223360	5226720	And he's like, it's like, so later on we'll do this, we'll do that. I said, yeah,
5226720	5229520	we're just chatting. And I turned to the guy next to me because it's weird that I haven't been
5229520	5233680	introduced, but they clearly know each other. I go, hi, I'm Jeff. He goes, I'm Craig. I hate Craig
5233680	5238160	or whatever his name was. And we shake hands. I get back in the house and Kate's father's like,
5238160	5244240	there's Jeff walking down the road, just saying, how do you do? Oh, good morning. I was like,
5244240	5248400	you fucking, there's a guy standing there. Like, like, introduce him. He goes, yes, Jeff,
5248400	5255520	we just don't do that. I go, it's called having a personality, Andy. Well, you ruined Craig's day.
5255760	5262240	Craig, Craig liked it. Craig's still talking about it. Also people he fucking knows.
5265200	5269760	So then we go, we go to Kate's family. They meet at the borders because some of our families in
5269760	5272640	England and some of our families in Scotland. So they meet at the Scottish English borders and we,
5272640	5277840	Dan and Aaron and I and Kate, we all go to the, to Hadrian's wall, you know, some famous old Roman
5277840	5281040	wall, you know, and shit. So we're looking at some history, but it was all closed. It was Boxing Day.
5281040	5285280	So all the tourist centers are closed. So we go back to the house. It's everybody there. We've
5285280	5288960	known, we've met all the family. There's a few Americans there, us and everyone else's Kate's
5288960	5292880	family. We meet everybody because we've been there for two days. There's a guy that comes in
5292880	5296800	who works with her mother. I don't know this guy. We're standing in the foyer and he's shaking off
5296800	5300320	his umbrella. And I go, hi, I'm Jeff. He goes, hi, my name is Craig. Cause they're all Craig for
5300320	5305680	some fucking reason. Everyone's named Craig. And we meet and he goes, he's asking me a question.
5305680	5308240	He's just like, it's like, so what are you doing since you've been here? I said, well, we went to
5308240	5312480	Hadrian's wall. I said, what part did you go to? I said, it was this part, but it was closed. He goes,
5312480	5316080	well, you know, like I'm a big history family. I know all about it. He's telling me all about
5316080	5320560	Hadrian's wall. And he was like going to this big expansive monologue about why this happened.
5320560	5323760	And I asked him questions and he's following up and then fucking Kate's dad comes in. Oh,
5323760	5330960	there's Jeff again. Fucking how do you do? I'm like, fuck you. It'd be so funny if it was like
5330960	5337360	six cents where we actually see what's happening and it's just you talking to this guy. Yeah. And
5337360	5342640	the other guy's just like trying to get away. Kate, Kate, warm. He's like, did Jenny fucking
5342640	5346400	talk to granny? Granny all fucking murder. Yeah. She fucking like granny hates everybody.
5346400	5350800	Granny's love me. I'm fucking great with the grandparents. Like, like granny hates everyone.
5350800	5355600	Like fucking Jenny with granny and fucking that granny. Guess what? Best fucking friends.
5355600	5362880	She fucking loved me. That's what you think. Yeah. She did. Actually Kate later on, she's like,
5362880	5366160	granny loves you. She's like, she hates everybody else, but she loves you. I was like, yeah,
5366160	5371600	because she hasn't been spoken to because you got a bunch of terse weirdos like fucking
5372320	5376160	make an effort. Cocksuckers. All right. Speaking of making an effort,
5376160	5378320	let's make an effort to play some D and D shall we?
5384720	5390320	When we last met, our heroes had yet again escaped Admiral Darkstar's clutches.
5390320	5395840	Thanks to Mulrain and Herope, our heroes were saved escaping certain death back to Bill
5395840	5401200	Martigans, the city that's everywhere. After returning to the ruins, Seekers hideout,
5401200	5406160	the party grew bored and discuss Krista Berg's genital reattachment, but ultimately found
5406160	5412000	themselves in a gnomish bar known as the rusty buckle. After much journeying, our heroes were
5412000	5418400	weary and sought the comfort of the pub, but inside upon seeing a wondrous gnome golem decided to
5418400	5424560	steal it. And after a tense robbery, the party got cold feet and returned the stolen golem,
5424560	5430800	but they were still interrupted by a specter from Quark's sordid past. The cactus bunch
5430800	5436640	had resurfaced. The gnomish gangsters attacked our party, but together our heroes slaughtered
5436640	5442080	them all. And after a brilliant speech by Sharpie, they robbed the remaining gnomes and set fire to
5442080	5450320	the pub, walking off into the foreground like badasses. But would they really just escape?
5450320	5456560	Scott Free? Is an arson a crime? And what if the cactus bunch, or the robot baby,
5456560	5459920	find out in an all new exciting episode of Harmontown?
5465680	5470320	So I wasn't here last week. I was disappointed. It sounded like we didn't steal the robot baby,
5470320	5473440	but what he actually did was we killed everyone and took all the robot babies.
5473440	5482560	Yeah. You and Aaron went nuts the first time. And then the following week, I think wanting a
5482560	5489280	robot baby is not nuts. But stealing it from people is crazy. But you went on a speech that
5489280	5493360	now we're going to be bad guys and steal everything. Because I have to justify this narrative somehow.
5493360	5500320	Like, okay, like, fine. We're chaotic evil now. Like, we're bad people now.
5500320	5503920	I think we're chaotic neutral. I'd say that's right. Yeah.
5503920	5506960	We've been bad for a long time. Thanks, Spencer. You're chaotic something.
5506960	5511280	All right. So do we have this robot golem, baby? Yeah, you got it. Yes.
5511280	5516720	What's the name of it? Well, I don't know. Let's name it. What should we...
5516720	5524320	Haldor? Haldor. Can we name it Haldor? H-E-L-D-E-R. You have to think about it.
5525040	5530160	What are you lying to us about? It's spelled different in Portuguese.
5531040	5537200	Do you think when Haldor grows up, he'll just be a giant simpleton that only says Haldor?
5537200	5547840	Haldor. Haldor. Haldor. Remember when Haldor... It's my least favorite part of Game of Thrones,
5547840	5551040	that whole storyline with the fucking kids and the magic trees. It's like...
5551920	5556160	But I remember when Haldor looked down a well and was like, Haldor.
5558240	5564560	It's so hard to not... It's just Timmy from South Park. That's all it is.
5564640	5567840	What a great gig as an actor, though. What are my lines? Okay, I got it.
5569040	5572560	Also, unlike Timmy from South Park, it's revealed at some point someone says,
5572560	5575920	it's not his name, you know. It's just the sound he makes.
5575920	5578880	That's not his name. His name's like Frank or something.
5578880	5581920	That's like Aanyang from Arrested Development kind of shit.
5584080	5588720	You know, that guy's a... By the way, every actor on Game of Thrones is also a house DJ.
5589440	5594480	And Haldor is a DJ. Grey Worm is a DJ.
5595840	5598240	Dinklage is a DJ. Dinklage is a DJ. Is he? No.
5599360	5603120	Well, he's American, but all... 90% of the cast has like...
5603120	5604240	That's not true.
5604240	5607120	Look it up. So many of them are like... Haldor actually...
5607120	5608480	He's got star tattoos.
5608480	5610880	Haldor helped launch his DJ career.
5610880	5611360	Sweet.
5612160	5616720	I would definitely... If I had to choose between two raves and one was being spun by Haldor...
5617120	5622480	And the other had like foam coming down from the ceiling. I'd be like, let's...
5622480	5626320	It'd be so funny if it's just popular songs, but the words are all replaced with Haldor.
5632240	5632800	Haldor.
5634000	5634480	Yeah.
5634480	5635600	I don't know why he'd sing it like...
5637600	5639360	It sounded like Johnny Cash or something.
5640000	5640720	Haldor.
5640720	5641200	Yeah.
5642160	5646160	I got a mean bad Haldor going down a 57 Chevy.
5647680	5650480	I get a mean bad.
5650480	5652320	It's going down the Chevy?
5653200	5653680	Yep.
5655600	5658400	The Chevy's so big it's got an elevator in it.
5659600	5660400	Haldor.
5660400	5661600	Haldor.
5661600	5664720	All right. I examine our surroundings, Spencer.
5664720	5669680	So behind you is a flaming domicile. It's the pub. It's on fire.
5669680	5672960	Around you are other stores, but they don't look...
5672960	5676160	They do look close enough that they might also catch on fire.
5676320	5676960	Oh, boy.
5677680	5681920	But they're not yet. There's just other stores. None of these stores are marked.
5681920	5686560	It's kind of not the best part of town you could tell. There's broken windows and stuff.
5687280	5688640	And one of them's on fire.
5688640	5692160	And one of the buildings on fire, yeah. Clear sign of poverty.
5694160	5699680	Do we have any aim right now? We just kind of finished a little bit of a mission, right?
5699680	5700880	We know we got this Gollum baby.
5700880	5705520	Yeah. We get to... This is one of those rare, delightful parts of a D&D campaign where you
5705520	5709440	can kind of... You get to really... We get to do whatever we want.
5710720	5714960	All right. If we wait too long, he's going to have a pterodactyl guy come out and go,
5714960	5716960	all right, pterodactylons, need your help.
5719040	5721120	But if we're smart about this, we can fucking...
5721120	5725040	I go to the building most adjacent to the fire,
5725040	5728560	and since this building's probably going to burn down, I just go examine it and see what's in there.
5728560	5729120	All right.
5729120	5732000	Are you trying to make looting sound gentlemanly?
5733680	5734320	I'm just being... Yeah.
5734560	5738400	Since this building's about to catch fire, I believe I'll peruse its wares.
5740400	5743600	It's an act of opportunity. What did you say about the opportunity?
5743600	5746640	I put my finger in his butt just in case we don't get sued later on.
5748240	5752640	So yeah, you go over to the building and you smell an overwhelming stench of fish.
5753200	5756800	You enter the door and you can tell no one's been here in quite a while.
5756800	5760320	The air just seems still and there's a coating of dust all over everything.
5760320	5762960	And the smell is just way worse in here.
5762960	5767280	You can see there's piles of... They look just kind of like brown putrid stuff.
5767280	5769760	They're gathered with flies and maggots.
5769760	5772480	Oh, it's probably robot baby food. We should feed this.
5773440	5776000	I was going to say, let's send the robot baby and just scout the...
5776640	5777440	Yeah. Okay.
5778880	5779440	Hell no.
5779440	5780640	Can the robot baby walk?
5780640	5782960	Robot baby isn't activated yet. We have to go find a little distillate.
5782960	5783840	Oh, that's right. Okay.
5783840	5785120	It's not activated?
5785120	5785920	It's not turned on, no.
5785920	5787520	It's just a dead baby we're walking around with.
5789440	5791360	All right. I get out of the dead fish store.
5791360	5792000	All right.
5792000	5793600	How do we activate the baby? I'm sorry.
5793600	5796800	There's a disc-shaped hole in its chest that we have to find some sort of thing
5796800	5798080	that probably plugs into that.
5798080	5799040	Like a CD kind of thing?
5799040	5802480	Like kind of like, yeah, kind of like a little, like a saucer-shaped thing like a CD.
5802480	5802720	Yeah.
5802720	5806160	I poke my head into the deserted fish store and say, hold on.
5809280	5809920	That happens.
5811280	5814960	And then I say, I'm going to be doing some DJing.
5816720	5817680	I go to the building...
5817680	5819840	Sliers haven't been invented yet, so...
5819840	5822480	I go to the building next to the dead fish store.
5822480	5825600	All right. This one, it looks like some sort of barber shop.
5826560	5830800	There's an old gnome. He's got orange hair that's styled pretty nicely.
5830800	5835760	And he's got small little glasses on his face, and he's just sweeping up.
5837600	5841040	As I say, sir, there's a fire a couple of doors down.
5841040	5842080	You might want to get out of here.
5842720	5845760	Oh, yeah, of course. You would go talk to the random people.
5845760	5852080	Oh, sir. Where are you going today?
5858960	5861280	Look, I'm a gnome, man. We're chatty.
5862640	5866160	We like talking to people. Cigarettes and riddles, baby.
5867600	5871200	So you say that to the gnome, and he looks at you kind of odd.
5871200	5876960	He's like, whoa, thanks. You seem awful casual about this.
5876960	5879040	I'm trying to warn you. There's a fire.
5879040	5882160	Yeah, no, I appreciate that. It just seemed your tone was like,
5882160	5885680	hey, man, it's sunny outside, but this is a fire you're talking about.
5885680	5888640	I'm not so worried right now. It's how casual you are.
5888640	5893280	You're the one being casual. I said fire, and you're being all prosaic and shit.
5893280	5895280	I'm just vibing off of your energies.
5898320	5900880	I'll fucking make you leak, motherfucker.
5900880	5904320	I don't... I'm just trying to chat.
5905360	5909200	I'll slash you wide open. You want to die in a fire? I'm trying to help you out.
5909200	5911040	I am appreciating that, man.
5911040	5913760	You have a very weird way of saying you're appreciating it.
5913760	5915920	I just thought it was a weird way you brought it up as well.
5915920	5916640	You're being weird.
5918160	5920640	See, this is what happens when you talk to strangers.
5922080	5923440	Can I get your phone number?
5925280	5925760	You see?
5926080	5929520	No, but he's just like, thanks.
5930320	5930800	I guess.
5930800	5933840	Okay, fuck it. I'm sorry I came in. Enjoy your barbershop.
5933840	5934720	You're gonna fucking die here.
5934720	5937840	It's just, if I saw fire, I would have been all like,
5937840	5939840	there's a fire. You gotta get out of here.
5939840	5942720	Well, the fire's been there a long time, you sweeping ass motherfucker.
5944960	5947840	We've adjusted to it. We did that.
5947840	5950080	We went fire, fire, and then we calmed down.
5950080	5951760	I was talking to people about it.
5951760	5953200	I was operating under the assumption.
5953280	5956000	Look, first of all, you have a barbershop next to a dead fish place,
5956000	5959360	which is fucking like, you know, you stopped caring a long time ago.
5963360	5963920	Sidebar.
5966000	5966640	Campaigners.
5968000	5973200	Why are we hanging out in the town that we murdered and set fire to?
5973200	5974560	He's from, yeah, let's go to another town.
5974560	5976320	We ain't gonna get out of this town.
5976320	5977360	This is all shitty fish stores.
5977360	5979360	Wait, can't we go back? We're in Beaumont again.
5979360	5982800	Can't we go through that toilet bucket thing that gets us that portal thing?
5982800	5987840	Doesn't that take us to the place where the fucking Admiral Darkstar at Sinking Island is?
5987840	5990160	I don't know. It's a paradise. It was paradise.
5990160	5993200	Yeah, we destroyed that, like everything we touch.
5993200	5995280	Yeah, we put up a parking lot.
5996240	5999840	Yeah, I say the sooner we get out of this weird ass town.
5999840	6002960	We have to find a new place that we haven't yet ruined.
6004000	6005600	Let's go to ruin a new place.
6005600	6010960	All right. Is there the equivalent of like a Palm Springs?
6010960	6012320	A depot or a bus station?
6012320	6015120	So some place that we can embark on a new thing.
6015120	6017920	Yeah, how do people travel out of here quickly, Orange Hair?
6017920	6019440	You don't see anything like that.
6019440	6022480	You haven't seen anything like that since you arrived here.
6022480	6023600	I'm asking Orange Hair.
6024320	6025040	Orange Hair.
6025040	6026240	A sweeper.
6026240	6028080	Oh, he's gone. He left.
6028080	6028560	He left?
6028560	6030000	Oh, we're still in his store?
6030000	6031200	Yeah, well, there's a fire.
6035200	6037200	Everyone's super casual about it.
6038080	6039440	I turn to the rest of the group and go,
6039440	6042320	look, that guy, that's a complicated dude.
6042320	6043920	If I ever see him, I'm probably gonna kill him.
6043920	6046640	I loot his store.
6046640	6048400	I look around and try to loot his store.
6048400	6050560	You find three scissors and six combs.
6050560	6051920	I fucking take all of that shit.
6053360	6055280	I put one in my hair like an afro pick
6055280	6058400	and fucking like walk out black exploitation style.
6060800	6061840	Yeah, it looks like that.
6061840	6064400	I wrap wax paper around one of the combs
6064400	6066240	and I make a homemade kazoo.
6069440	6071600	It's both fun and family friendly.
6072960	6075600	I whip out my non-dick and piss on the floor.
6076640	6078000	It just drips down your leg.
6081040	6082640	Hey, this is how it is?
6084240	6085760	Let's get to the center of town, you guys,
6085760	6087040	and find a fucking way out of here.
6088080	6089040	Is there a downtown?
6089040	6089840	Center of town.
6089840	6091360	Why did it get out of town?
6092080	6093920	Can I ask a weird question?
6093920	6096400	Does a robot baby have a robot dick?
6096400	6096960	Uh, no.
6097920	6099360	You can't have the baby's tits.
6103200	6104560	We're not potato people.
6104560	6106160	You can't just switch parts.
6107200	6108800	I just wanted to see if it was...
6108800	6110240	Anyway, yeah, let's go to...
6110240	6110720	Bad place.
6110720	6112000	Let's go to the town center.
6112000	6113680	Why are we going to the center of the town
6113680	6114400	that we want to get out of?
6114400	6116160	Maybe there's a fucking airport or some shit.
6116160	6117200	We gotta leave.
6117200	6118400	Well, what do you propose?
6118400	6119040	Why should we go?
6119040	6122240	Just the opposite direction of the havoc we've caused.
6122240	6122720	Let's go.
6122720	6123360	Wander far.
6123360	6126240	Let's get the fuck out of Bill Martigan's right now.
6126240	6127200	Yeah, you lead the way.
6127200	6127680	Okay.
6127680	6128240	Charge!
6128240	6129520	We go north.
6129520	6130880	You go north.
6130880	6131920	As you get through,
6131920	6133680	as you work your way through Bill Martigan's,
6133680	6136000	the buildings get closer and closer together.
6136000	6136720	You find it.
6136720	6138080	There's less and less roads.
6138080	6141200	It's harder and harder to get out of this place,
6141200	6143440	and you manage to squeeze yourself
6143440	6145600	past several skinny alleys,
6145600	6147920	and you come to what looks like a large,
6147920	6151520	large wall that stretches up as high as the eye can see.
6151520	6152640	It's like a video game.
6154320	6155040	We gotta find...
6155120	6157920	How the hell do we go back to the entrance?
6157920	6160320	Do we still have that staff of that gross?
6161040	6162400	I don't think so.
6162400	6164080	Unless there's a different one.
6164080	6165920	The first one, yeah, definitely melted.
6165920	6166480	All right.
6166480	6166800	All right.
6166800	6168960	Well, maybe I could teleport to the top of the wall
6168960	6169840	and throw rope down.
6170480	6172320	Is my teleport cape still out of charge?
6173040	6174160	Yeah, you'd have to sleep.
6175120	6176000	All right.
6176000	6178080	Where's the entrance to the town?
6178080	6179440	We got in here somehow.
6179440	6180880	You came in here through, yeah,
6180880	6183200	there was a kind of like an entrance checkpointy place.
6183200	6183600	All right.
6183600	6184800	To the checkpoint place.
6185040	6187840	You head back through all those squishy buildings too.
6188480	6189920	The checkpointy place,
6189920	6193360	and you find there's a different bucket
6193360	6195600	than the one that you saw when you first came here,
6195600	6197040	and there's no gnome on it.
6197040	6199040	But it's just like a small clearing.
6199040	6199920	It's fenced off,
6199920	6202000	but behind the fence is this same wall,
6202000	6204400	and you notice it looks like it's woven together,
6204400	6207200	like thatched or something like that.
6207840	6208480	This wall.
6209280	6209920	That's tall.
6209920	6210800	This tall wall.
6210800	6212640	But there's another little portal bucket?
6212640	6213520	There's a bucket.
6213520	6215200	I stick my head in the bucket and look at it.
6215200	6216000	It's just a bucket.
6223680	6226080	There's nobody in there for you to start conversations with?
6228960	6231360	Live your life however you want to do it, man.
6231360	6232720	So when we-
6232720	6235840	Fucking weird, closeted, anti-social life.
6237280	6241200	I mean, all this stranger talking has certainly made you very friendly.
6242080	6245840	I'm being persecuted for being interested in the other.
6247600	6252080	Having a sense of possibly that you can learn something by meeting other people.
6252080	6254960	If it makes you happy, you know, then be happy.
6254960	6255280	It does.
6255280	6256720	You guys are being weird about it.
6256720	6257760	I'm not doing anything.
6257760	6258320	Yes, you are.
6258320	6259280	You're being fucking weird.
6259280	6260320	Yeah, Dan, what the fuck?
6263360	6263920	I didn't say.
6263920	6269600	I mean, I have observations about the way Jeff manages his social life.
6270000	6272240	Oh, man, give him experience points.
6273600	6275760	How did- when we got into this town-
6275760	6277120	You climbed in through a bag.
6278320	6279840	I don't even remember that shit.
6281120	6282080	Do we still have that bag?
6282800	6284640	No, I think it was left on the ground.
6286640	6287280	Oh, shit.
6287280	6288400	Back by the fire?
6288400	6291280	Back in the entrance, where you guys now are.
6291280	6292640	Oh, is there a bag?
6292640	6293760	You don't see it.
6293760	6294640	There's a bucket.
6294640	6296240	It's just a fucking regular old bucket.
6296400	6296900	Yep.
6298160	6299600	I say Hodor into the bucket.
6300960	6301600	That happens.
6302640	6303120	All right.
6305120	6308000	This woven, thatchy wall is blocking our way out?
6308000	6308320	Yep.
6308320	6309440	Well, let's do what we do.
6310080	6311200	Let's set it on fire.
6314960	6316480	That's our shtick now, right?
6319360	6320080	When in doubt.
6320880	6322080	Flaming fire sordid or-
6322880	6329040	Uh, I go up and I try to attack the wall and make a hole in it.
6329040	6331440	I bet it's not gonna work, but let's go for it.
6331440	6332000	Jeez.
6332000	6333120	Fucking negative Nelly.
6334640	6337600	Wait, I'm the one proposing that we not set something on fire,
6337600	6339200	and I'm the negative Nelly?
6339200	6340560	I'm just trying to chop it.
6340560	6341440	All right, you miss.
6342480	6343440	You missed a wall?
6344640	6345440	Yeah.
6345440	6346720	How did you miss a wall?
6346720	6348480	Because I was being heckled by my friends.
6348480	6352160	Yeah, he did this.
6352160	6352800	You were swinging.
6355040	6355600	It's not gonna help.
6356800	6358240	It's like playing darts with him.
6358240	6358560	You gonna miss?
6360160	6361680	Well, try it again.
6362320	6363600	You fucking do something.
6363600	6364800	I don't have swords.
6364800	6366000	I'm a man of-
6366000	6366720	Use your magic.
6367600	6367920	All right.
6367920	6372480	I cast Morgan Canan's thatched wall destruction.
6372480	6373520	You don't know that spell.
6374000	6379040	All right, well, let's try this.
6379680	6381520	A very controlled fireball.
6383520	6386160	You're gonna light something on fire again, huh?
6386160	6388480	How far- how close are you guys to this wall?
6388480	6392080	Well, I mean, obviously, I'm not gonna shoot it
6392800	6394320	if my friends are standing there.
6394320	6394960	Just making sure.
6394960	6397520	Everybody back up, but I'm gonna do try something.
6397520	6398160	Good call.
6398160	6400560	We instinctively move away from his fireball.
6400560	6401360	All right.
6401360	6402880	You launch a fireball!
6404240	6405120	What I don't know.
6405120	6410160	Well, it does hit, because nobody was haranguing him during it.
6410160	6411120	Yeah, it hits.
6411760	6412320	The wall-
6412320	6413200	It worked sharpie.
6413200	6416960	It immediately starts catching fire from the fireball,
6416960	6419040	and it spreads in all directions.
6420000	6420720	Yeah!
6420720	6421360	You're welcome.
6422960	6424400	We do what we do.
6426320	6429040	We're either gonna get out of here or I'll go to jail.
6429040	6429600	Yeah.
6429600	6431760	The wall continues to burn, spreading out,
6431760	6434480	and you see it starts to catch up- or catch on fire
6434480	6436960	some of the buildings nearby where you guys are
6437840	6439280	that are touching the wall.
6439280	6440400	I try and- I'm like,
6440400	6442480	Hey, who set the wall on fire?
6443440	6444080	Behind-
6444080	6445120	Guys, I think we're good.
6446400	6448480	Behind this wall, you see another wall.
6448480	6450560	It's very similar, but it's more of-
6450560	6452320	I'd call it like a maroon color.
6453920	6456720	But it's also the same fibrous material.
6456720	6458640	But it's not on fire from this fire?
6458640	6461280	No, it's kind of like as this wall's burning away,
6461360	6463040	it's revealing this kind of different wall,
6463040	6463680	if that makes sense.
6464240	6465840	I think we all know what to do, guys.
6469120	6470400	Satate on fire!
6473360	6474080	Lightning bolt.
6474640	6474960	All right.
6476160	6477840	You blast it with the lightning bolt,
6477840	6480000	and it scorches a small pinpoint,
6480560	6482880	but it doesn't continue on fire.
6482880	6483680	Can I go look in the-
6483680	6484480	It just singes it.
6484480	6486640	Can I go look in the hole to see what's on the other side?
6486640	6486880	Yeah.
6487520	6488240	You look in.
6488800	6490640	Your eye is instantly bitten,
6490640	6493120	not by bites, but by cold.
6494960	6498000	Frost taints your eye with its cold grip
6498560	6500960	as you look and see nothing but white.
6500960	6502960	White light all around you,
6502960	6505440	and then you get hit in the eye by something.
6505440	6506880	It's snow.
6506880	6508640	It's a piece of snow hits you in the eye.
6509680	6510180	Shit.
6510720	6511760	Piece of snow?
6511760	6512260	Yeah.
6512560	6513760	I think they call it a flake.
6515600	6516100	Right?
6516640	6517140	Yeah.
6517840	6518480	Snowflake.
6519120	6520160	Hits you in the eye!
6521360	6522080	And it melts.
6522080	6523360	How much damage does it take?
6523360	6525760	It just, you notice it tangibly.
6527840	6529200	It's just a snowflake.
6529200	6530160	It's not painful.
6530160	6530400	All right.
6530400	6531680	So we got one wall.
6531680	6532720	It's a two-wall system.
6532720	6534640	There's a statue one that's on fire,
6534640	6536080	and then there's the maroon wall
6536640	6538800	that is impervious to lightning strike.
6539600	6542000	Well, but we could also try and set it on fire.
6542000	6543200	Well, it wasn't impervious.
6543200	6544000	I mean, strictly speaking.
6544000	6545680	Yeah, it didn't do much damage to it,
6545680	6548000	and then beyond that is just Snowtown USA.
6549840	6550480	I don't like it.
6551600	6553760	We gotta, if we're in a tundra,
6553760	6555280	we can't just walk away.
6555280	6557360	The fire on the other parts of the wall
6557360	6559840	continue burning and spreading on fire more.
6559840	6562080	I don't think we can hang out here.
6564560	6567040	And we're not going to get a lot of help from the locals.
6567040	6567540	No.
6568320	6569840	I mean, they really should not help.
6569840	6570800	I look around for that,
6570800	6572800	I look around for that bag that we came in through.
6574000	6575200	You still don't see it.
6576400	6577600	Smoke clouds your vision.
6577600	6578880	We should have done that before
6579520	6580880	you set the wall on fire.
6580880	6582480	Everybody spread out and look for that bag
6582480	6583440	that we came in through.
6583440	6585440	All right, I really look for it.
6585440	6587760	Yeah, I also worked really hard to look for it.
6589280	6593040	All right, Sharpie, you see it's a small box.
6593040	6594800	It just catches your eye.
6594800	6596320	I got a box over here.
6596320	6598320	The rest of you find nothing of value.
6599120	6600640	John Doe has the upper hand.
6602640	6603440	What's in the box?
6606240	6607120	What's in the box?
6607120	6608560	What's in the box?
6609280	6611520	That's Nick Cage.
6611520	6613920	I open it carefully with my switchblade.
6613920	6616560	You open the box and you see, you see.
6617520	6618880	It's just a ton of cigarettes.
6620160	6621200	I dump them out.
6621200	6621700	All right.
6625360	6626880	Cigarettes litter the floor.
6629360	6631120	I keep looking for the bag.
6631120	6632720	You don't find anything else.
6632720	6633360	What do I find?
6633360	6634960	No, you guys didn't find anything
6634960	6636960	except he found this box of cigarettes.
6637120	6639680	All right, well, what do I...
6639680	6640960	I smoke one of the cigarettes
6640960	6642240	because I could use a smoke right now.
6642240	6642720	Yeah.
6642720	6645600	There wasn't there that one guy who wanted cigarettes?
6645600	6646240	Remember him?
6646880	6648320	Yeah, so we murdered him.
6649520	6650400	Did we murder him?
6651280	6651760	Probably.
6652880	6654160	Historically speaking, yes.
6656080	6657440	Okay, I'm fucking confused.
6657440	6658480	Is this a wall?
6658480	6660800	Well, we don't want to get out to the tundra, right?
6660800	6661600	We don't want to do that.
6661600	6662480	I guess not.
6662480	6664080	I mean, we're not really dressed for it.
6664480	6668960	And there's no way out of...
6668960	6670960	We've set the thing we're in on fire.
6671760	6672160	Yeah.
6672160	6673840	There's no lesson to be learned from this.
6674480	6676480	Well, don't rob people.
6677600	6678240	We were so...
6678240	6679120	What did I do?
6679120	6679760	We finished...
6680480	6682560	We're turning on each other like a Stephen K.
6684880	6686240	What is my cactus card?
6686880	6688400	It's a small card.
6688960	6690000	It's laminated.
6690000	6691760	It says the cactus bunch.
6692720	6694400	And my little painted stick.
6694400	6696000	We never figured out what that did, right?
6696000	6696800	Nope.
6696800	6700720	I cast acid splash on the maroon thatching.
6700720	6701920	Where are you aiming it?
6701920	6703120	So on this thing.
6703120	6706560	I want at the pinhole where my shock and crash lightning bolt.
6706560	6708400	So you do that and it splashes,
6708400	6711760	and you see sizzling and little bits of smoke
6711760	6714000	as it kind of spreads this hole wider.
6714000	6716880	It's maybe now the size of a head-sized hole.
6717680	6719040	Just still seeing white.
6719040	6720720	Now a bit of snow's kind of coming in.
6722320	6724400	Um, sounds great.
6724400	6725200	We have three...
6725200	6726800	I have three vials of acid.
6726800	6728560	Can I throw those on there?
6728560	6729120	Sure, yeah.
6730000	6730640	What do you guys think?
6731760	6734000	Using the remaining acid in your possession,
6734000	6736720	you acid up an entire man-sized hole
6736720	6738720	big enough for someone to fit through like a man.
6741040	6741760	Or a woman.
6743120	6745520	I go through it with my cloak of resistance on.
6745520	6746240	You do that.
6747600	6748880	Is anyone else going to do anything?
6748880	6751280	Oh, I have boots of wintry mite.
6752720	6754080	So I put those on.
6756240	6757360	And I go out and I'm like,
6757360	6758560	hey, I've got your boots.
6760560	6761520	Too winter?
6761520	6762240	Too winter.
6762240	6762720	Oh, okay.
6763360	6763680	All right.
6763680	6764800	Yeah, you do that too.
6764800	6767280	You guys, you both exit and you see,
6767280	6769760	as you step out, you feel your body changing
6769760	6770720	and you step out.
6770720	6773040	And as you step out, you see on the floor,
6773040	6776080	you just see a bag, just a bag with a hole in it.
6776080	6776560	Bag!
6777600	6778400	Is this our bag?
6778960	6780800	You see smoke issuing out of it.
6781680	6782960	Oh, fuck you.
6785920	6787360	Did we acid the bag?
6787360	6787680	No.
6788480	6790720	Is the bag on fire too or whatever's in there?
6790720	6792000	I look in the bag.
6792000	6793840	You see, you poke your head in the bag
6793840	6796880	and you see Bill Martigan's and Sharpie and Morin and shit.
6797440	6798800	And a fire all over the place.
6799760	6800560	What the fuck?
6800560	6801600	It just goes in there.
6802400	6803840	We're just back where we started from?
6803840	6804800	No, you're in the snow.
6805520	6807200	Outside there's a bag and it's a portal
6807200	6809440	to just inside what we set on fire.
6809440	6810480	All right, I pick up the bag.
6810800	6815200	All right, you guys are still inside this fire.
6815200	6816560	I have some kind of resist.
6816560	6817520	Hellscape.
6817520	6819360	Anybody have to have any ideas what we should do right now?
6820080	6821760	Throw a snow in the bag.
6821760	6822400	Say what?
6822400	6823520	Throw a snow in the bag.
6823520	6824640	Maybe we'll put off the fires.
6826080	6828240	How much snow are we going to throw in the bag?
6830240	6832800	I take a handful of snow and I throw it in the bag.
6832800	6835920	You take a handful of snow and throw it into the bag.
6836720	6840160	Sharpie, a handful of snow comes and falls onto the floor.
6840160	6840720	That's great.
6844000	6845200	Really fixed everything.
6846240	6847520	I'm coming out.
6847520	6848960	I go out through the hole.
6848960	6851760	I know I had some kind of resist elements.
6852720	6854640	I think all of you have cloaks of resistance.
6854640	6855040	Great.
6855040	6855840	We'll put them all on.
6855840	6856320	All right.
6856320	6860000	Come on, Haldor, as Christoperk or...
6860000	6860880	Oh, no, Morin.
6860880	6862320	Do we see anything?
6862320	6863200	You see nothing.
6863200	6864640	It's all Tundra style.
6865520	6866480	Wait a second.
6866480	6867600	You see something.
6867600	6869280	Part of the whiteness of the Tundra
6869280	6870960	is moving, moving towards you.
6871520	6873920	Looks like a large humanoid figure,
6873920	6875840	maybe about seven or eight feet tall.
6876480	6877680	This would probably be an ally.
6880320	6880560	Right?
6882000	6883200	Someone that'll help us out.
6883840	6884640	Why don't you go up there and...
6885440	6886480	I go up there and I go,
6886480	6887680	Hey, how's it going?
6887680	6888800	I introduce myself to...
6891280	6892320	How do you do?
6893440	6894640	I'm Quark.
6895920	6898880	Just introducing myself to who knows who.
6899520	6901840	It's pretty far off, but you do that
6901840	6903840	and it shuffles closer to you.
6903840	6906800	It seems like a big hairy, hairy man
6906800	6908480	sort of thing covered in white fur.
6909280	6909840	It's a...
6909840	6911680	These things are always misunderstood.
6911680	6912560	It's like a...
6912560	6913920	It's like a Yeti situation.
6913920	6915920	But like a Harry Henderson kind of Yeti.
6915920	6917120	It's a Harry.
6917120	6918000	It's a Harry.
6919520	6920160	Yo-ho!
6920880	6921600	We love you!
6922880	6925040	It continues to draw closer.
6925040	6927120	We don't judge you for being a monster.
6927120	6928720	Oh, don't use the M word!
6929440	6931840	That's their word!
6936400	6937920	Are you human-splaining?
6939440	6940320	The M word.
6941520	6942400	All right.
6942400	6942880	Well, yeah.

6949120	6949760	I love you.
6949760	6950400	You're a Yeti.
6951040	6953680	You're super intelligent and misunderstood
6953680	6954800	and you're going to help us out.
6955840	6958160	The Yeti continues drawing nearer
6958160	6959840	and then you see it move its arm
6959840	6962320	and a large frozen neck
6962320	6964080	comes over all of your bodies.
6966320	6968560	He's giving us a blanket with holes in it.
6970480	6971440	Cliffhanger!
6973440	6974400	All right.
