0	16560	Hello and all, thank you for tuning in from beautiful uptown Burbank.
16560	31200	Carment Town is now in session.
31200	39960	Let's welcome the stage to Game Master, Spencer Crittenden, as he bounds to the stage nimbly
39960	45200	like a mountain goat, with his bag of holding things.
45200	50320	Hello, I'm your comptroller Jeff Davis, going to be back in town with you all.
50320	54400	Let's hear it for your mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
54400	63960	Yeah, yeah, yeah, rapping off the top of my head like butter top bread is coming out at
63960	64960	the top of the show.
64960	67640	It's going to help your mind and your body and soul grow.
67640	73600	I'm a motherfucking rap master, I saw your mama's ass and blasted her with my penis,
73600	74600	but it was consensual.
74600	77120	Oh shit, it was more than that, it was sensual.
77120	83560	I took her out to Great America, it's a theme park.
83560	84560	We had a good time.
84560	86560	We had a pretty good time.
86560	89800	Excuse me, what's going on up there?
89800	90800	Oh, it's Shropp.
90800	92800	Alright, cut the music.
92800	94600	Shropp is just haranguing you from the background?
94600	98480	I don't know, I think he's haranguing someone else so loudly that it sounded like he was
98480	99480	haranguing the show.
99480	103760	Well, it sounded like that was more than consensual, that it was actually achieved sensual.
103760	107720	Yeah, that's kind of cheating, rhyme wise.
107720	108720	But not politically.
108720	113400	Her name wasn't Swela, her name was Consuela.
113400	118320	I got into the Uber to come here tonight and...
118320	122160	You're still taking those Ubers, huh?
123160	124960	Alright, I gotta work on that.
124960	125960	I gotta take lifts.
125960	130760	I don't know what it is, it's like a weird, I don't know, I don't know what I'm clinging
130760	131760	to.
131760	139120	I think it's just the Ubers in Los Angeles, they're like big vehicles with guys that
139120	144360	are like, yeah, it's the social thing, it's the distance.
144360	151080	The last time I took a lift, I told the story, I think, at least I know I told it on Twitter.
152080	155560	I was like, yeah, I sit with my foot tucked under my butt.
155560	160480	The guy was like, he spent the first half of the ride complaining about how the area
160480	164680	was being gentrified.
164680	169720	And then the second half of the ride was consumed by this weird moment where he asked me to
169720	174400	not put my foot on his upholstery.
174400	176200	It was not a good car.
176200	177800	Were you taking regular lifts?
177800	178800	Yeah.
178800	181800	It wasn't like lift asshole.
181800	184560	You should be taking lift hotshots.
184560	189440	This guy, you know what, he may have accepted the fare from the regular lift, maybe he's
189440	191920	usually only available to lift hotshot.
191920	196760	But it was like, I guess I shouldn't use that as an excuse, lots of lift drivers, but it
196760	201200	was like, Jesus Christ, man, there's something, there's some line you cross with lift, and
201200	206040	I think this is probably an LA thing, it just seems like Uber continues to be basically
206040	212240	Armenian limo drivers who are making money in their spare time, and it's not that they're
212240	215240	Do you get black car or do you get regular Uber?
215240	223560	I get the fancy thing because I just, the distance, it's the emotional distance, just
223560	226720	wherever I'm going, I just want to be left alone for the ride, you know?
226720	233400	I just put my earphones in and there's a little small talk, you know, like tonight, halfway
233400	237120	there, how did he phrase it?
237120	250720	The guy said, let's take a look here, he said, you go to the Starbucks?
250720	254000	That was him making small talk, like, yeah, do you like, do you like to do things?
254000	259720	Yeah, I think he was probably saying like, why are you driving 15 miles to a Starbucks?
259720	261080	Aren't there nine of them around your house?
261560	268480	He's like, nah, it's the Starburns, he's like, oh, did he make a five stars?
269320	270880	Did he make a five stars?
272240	275000	Yeah, no, well, they always make five stars or whatever.
275000	277840	Now is it going to be a, yeah, I don't know.
277840	279280	There's no better way to do that either, right?
279280	286600	Like the only time you, like you pick up your phone and you're going to, you're going to call a
286600	291880	ride and then you have to go through this like deposition about your last ride, which was
291880	293200	probably two days ago.
293880	296200	Did, did, did Armand do a good job?
296200	302200	Like, uh, and now there's like tipping and all this shit and I'm not complaining about anything.
302240	303240	That's the good news.
304040	309040	Like I'm so, I'm so, I'm so low, I don't know, low is not the word.
309080	312960	I'm shrub, like, I'm like, you know, remember how shrub was two weeks ago?
313080	315400	Yeah, I'm kind of in that shrub zone.
315520	317200	But you're a little bit of a funk.
317320	319160	It might be because shrub came over today.
319200	320600	That's a good thing, right?
320640	321600	Maybe I got shrubbed.
321600	324200	Do you think he, he, he flung some shrubbins on you?
324280	325960	Maybe I'm coming down from John Mayer.
326120	327960	Whoa, how about that show?
328000	329720	Let's talk about, let's talk about our show.
329760	333760	Oh, yeah, I go away and all of a sudden you have John Mayer on your show.
334240	336200	That guy's body's a wonderland.
337640	339560	Did you listen to the, to the episode?
339760	341720	I listened to, uh, like probably half of it.
341840	342840	Hmm.
344680	346840	It has the Steve Levy seal of approval.
346920	350680	Yeah, Levy's, Levy's, Levy's, Levy feels, and I don't know who's supposed to be
350680	354840	insulted by this, but I can tell he thinks like now that John Mayer has been
354840	358880	on, like, we're six months from DMB coming on.
359240	364400	Yeah. Maybe we could get advice on, on how to make a Wikipedia from them.
365160	367560	Uh, can I, can I embarrass myself?
367600	368440	What's DMB?
368520	369400	Dave Matthews Band.
369640	373200	But I, but I, I don't want to insult Dave Matthews Band with that.
373320	374360	I didn't embarrass myself at all.
374360	375840	I don't want to insult John Mayer with that.
375880	377480	I don't have, I don't care about music.
377520	379200	I, I really like John Mayer.
379280	385640	Uh, he was, I wasn't, I was making, I was, just Levy is, uh, Levy is a very big Dave
385640	386280	Matthews fan.
386600	388560	So much so that he calls them the DMB.
389240	393480	And before you make fun of him for it, it's, it's something he used to go to with
393480	395160	his dad and his brother and now his dad's dead.
395160	395880	So fuck you.
395920	397320	So there's sentimentality there.
397360	397600	Yeah.
397600	398280	Okay.
398840	402240	That's a, that takes away from their music prowess.
402480	402800	Yeah.
402800	405840	I mean, they, they rock that heart anyway.
405880	407160	I don't want Dave Matthews to be listening.
407160	408160	And he's like, Oh, cool.
408160	409680	There's this guy's a fan.
409680	411400	And then it's like, Oh, cause his dad died.
411400	414160	And then Dave Matthews is like, what's it's not my cords.
414200	416880	Somebody, somebody hum me a Dave Matthews band song.
416880	418080	Steve, yell out at Dave.
428280	436760	Oh, he, oh, he, oh, he, oh, he, oh, he, oh, he, oh, he, oh, he, oh, he, oh, he, oh,
436760	445040	oh, oh, he, oh, he, oh, he, oh, he, oh, he, oh, he, oh, he, oh, he, oh, he, oh, he, oh.
445040	449400	This is dead on just if you don't know somebody got to put that to a beat.
449400	450800	We got to get Rob tantrum on that one.
450800	453160	It was called Dave Matthews band.
453200	456760	Yeah, David sounds more like donkey Matthews band.
456800	459400	That sounded like an emotional donkey.
460720	464680	That's a way of speaking of emotions, Dan, you know, people can connect themselves to
464680	467960	bands because there's sentimental value to it because you're, you, you went to the
467960	471760	show with your father or you grew up listening to it and yet, you know, your, your
471760	477280	stepmom's house or whatever, and you have these emotional connections to things that
477280	480040	maybe you wouldn't have otherwise.
480640	484680	Like sports, for instance, like people can get patriotic about like, I'm a Dodgers
484680	488640	fan because I'm from L.A. and they get their assholes about it or Yankees fans or
488640	489560	whoever, wherever you're from.
490040	493920	But some people can just love the San Francisco Giants because that's where their
494000	497360	father took them when they were little before, before the father died.
498080	503520	So, um, I don't know if you have any special emotional connections to any sports
503520	504000	teams.
504280	507000	I just wish the Eagles would finally get a Super Bowl win.
509240	512640	Sports corner.
513000	513640	Sports corner.
513840	516080	L-1-1, that means 52.
516080	518440	If you're a Latin, it's a Super Bowl.
518480	521400	52 Dan Harmon is going to break it down for you.
521520	522280	Sports corner.
524520	527120	Obviously, you know, I'm not going to pretend I didn't hear about it.
527160	528840	You can't, you can't, you can't avoid it.
529440	530320	The Eagles won.
531600	535640	It was their first win ever, literally ever, their first Super Bowl win in the
535640	541000	history of the franchise, a franchise that has got to be, who, who knows how old?
541200	543080	Yeah, for 80,000 years.
543120	545760	What, what, what stood out for you watching the game most?
545760	548520	Like what, what was the most capital Y yardage?
548560	550160	Like so much, that's how they won.
550160	553520	If you, if you go back play by play, the Eagles had more yardage.
553560	554440	That's how they won.
554560	556480	The Patriots were short on yardage.
556760	558400	Um, they didn't ice their knees.
558720	561400	Uh, and, uh, they came in over confident.
561400	561760	Why?
562040	564120	Oh, they thought they had more yardage from previous games.
564400	566360	Yardage only counts game for game.
566480	566840	Yeah.
566840	570440	You, you, you, you, you, you, you tabulate it throughout the season.
570440	573360	You're trying to figure out like what teams have a better chance of winning,
573360	575320	but that can be a blessing or a curse.
575680	580000	In my opinion, Jeff, and I am, I am, I'm sorry, this is just one man's opinion.
580280	586160	I think that the, uh, Patriots came in fucking, uh, thinking we got the yardage.
586680	591680	Uh, they, but what they failed to understand is that every team starts
592000	594400	every game with zero yardage.
595200	596320	That's a technical fact.
597320	602920	What do you think this loss, this loss for the Patriots means for Tom Brady going forward?
602920	607680	Well, obviously Tom Brady is going to have a lot of recovery to do, uh, his many, uh,
607720	610800	injuries throughout the game, like, uh, or just the beginning of it.
610800	613880	He's also now got injuries related to his leadership.
613880	618720	I don't know if you saw his press conference after the game, um, but he cited, uh, practice
618920	624640	and, um, uh, coaching and, uh, teammanship and, you know, but what people wanted to
625000	630640	hear from him really was leadership first, which he did mention, but he mentioned in
630640	631200	the wrong order.
631480	635360	And, um, so Brady's going to have to circle back and he's going to have to think, am I
635360	637160	the person that needs to lead these Patriots?
637200	639080	He's only five years younger than you are right now.
639080	642040	He might be the oldest quarterback in Super Bowl history.
642040	643360	Uh, like what do you think?
643360	645040	Are you asking if he's the quarterback?
645480	647440	What do you even know anything about sports?
647680	650080	Of course Tom Brady is the quarterback of the Patriots.
650120	652520	I'm saying, do you think that, what does this mean for him?
652520	658560	He's famous for wearing one glove, like a weird colored glove or that's a different
658560	658840	player.
658840	659200	Okay.
659240	659600	All right.
660480	662920	Do you think, do you think he ought to retire after this one?
662920	666040	I should, should he hang up his, hang up his weird color glove or should he, should he
666040	667120	bring it back next season?
667160	671000	I think, I think, you know, look, uh, this is a dangerous sport, you know, no matter
671000	675880	how many times you ice your knee, you're still going out there and, uh, uh, not
675880	679640	evenly risking concussion, but actually statistically just accumulating concussion
679760	683920	and spine injury on behalf of a corporation that's going to spend the off season deciding
683920	686920	whether there should be a rule against you kneeling during the fucking national anthem,
686920	687920	which is kind of an insult.
687920	689760	So let's go into politics corner.
693960	694280	Yeah.
694320	694880	How was that?
694880	696720	I like really think of the irony of that.
696720	701400	Imagine being a football player and knowing that the NFL commissioner is going to, is
701400	707200	going to spend this off season thinking about rules against protest on the field.
708200	713560	Uh, clever move, always the, the, the anti protest rule, hadn't thought of that.
714120	720440	Um, the, the, these are these, and then concurrently, like, is all this like
720440	722840	concussion information is coming out.
722840	726960	Like, like, not that it's never been there, but it's just, it's right there in
726960	732160	the zeitgeist, right next to, uh, the fact that these are people who are not allowed
732160	738040	to express in a completely peaceful way that arguably deferent still to the
738040	743560	national anthem, the fact that while they were lucky enough, um, and talented enough
743680	747200	to end up where they are with everyone paying attention to them, they'd like to
747200	751320	risk their entire career and reputation saying, yeah, but I'm not comfortable.
751320	753400	What's going on back in my hometown.
753560	757200	I don't like the policies I I'm, I'm, so I'm going to kneel during this national
757200	760080	anthem as if in deference to my fallen brethren.
760320	765200	Um, uh, because I don't want it to privilege to turn me into, uh, uh, someone
765200	766960	who turns their back on, on their fellow man.
767240	771440	And, and, and that's caused such a stir because we love to show up and watch
771440	775880	these guys injure themselves, um, until they're like basically dead at 40
775960	779800	physically, because their brain has been concussed so many times.
780240	782280	Um, their spine slowly mangled.
782320	783560	He's talking to you, Tom Brady.
783560	787120	Uh, um, it's kind of fucking ironic, isn't it?
788280	792840	Especially when the two teams in the, uh, Superbowl are the Patriots and the Eagles.
792880	793160	Yeah.
793640	796440	They could have been the Des Moines star-spangled banners.
797800	798880	The uncle Sam's.
799480	800760	Uh, yeah.
801080	801480	All right.
801480	803160	Well, look, I don't, I don't have anything.
803160	807040	Let's, let's, let's, the Trenton apple pies.
807760	808120	I don't know.
809760	810360	Oh shit.
810360	812360	Steve Levy just came down hard on Tom Brady.
812400	812600	Yeah.
812600	816280	I don't, I don't, I don't know who Tom Brady is, uh, in case that wasn't clear.
816320	818160	Wasn't he in, in Mad Max?
818840	820240	Um, all right.
820240	820640	He was.
820640	821080	Yeah.
821440	822640	He was Mad Max.
824200	824520	All right.
824520	826320	Well, let's bring up tonight's guests.
827360	829120	She scared the life out of me.
829160	833600	I can't think of a better way to follow up our award-winning show with John Mayer,
834320	838160	then a visit from, from the always surprising.
838200	839320	Find your, find your camera.
839680	840520	Find your camera.
840880	845880	You know, for $5 a month, uh, subscribers, you can, uh, you can see, uh, the
845880	847440	creepiest entrance of all time.
847480	848760	It's certainly something.
849160	851440	I have, um, I have a question.
852280	853760	Rob Schwab, everybody.
855320	856360	Schwab's in the house.
856480	857520	Schwab's in the house.
857600	866440	I have a, I have a speculation about like the kneeling during the sports.
866520	867480	You think they're, okay.
867920	868440	Uh-oh.
868480	869160	You think they're tired.
869680	870080	What?
870240	870960	You think they're tired.
870960	871640	Is that what you're going to say?
871680	873040	No, no, I have a question.
873080	873440	Okay.
873440	876560	So Republicans don't like it when the black people kneel.
876600	877440	They hate it.
877440	879200	They can't, they can't stand it.
879240	879520	Right.
879600	880320	They hate it.
880360	880840	Okay.
881200	885480	What if they kneel during something that we liked?
885520	885800	Right.
885800	890080	Like puppy adoption, welfare, you know, like
890480	891480	kneel during welfare.
891520	891800	Yeah.
891800	894200	They could like, somebody's handing over a welfare check.
897200	898240	Oh, yeah.
898880	900320	We would be like, come on.
900880	901160	Yeah.
901160	902400	That's not cool.
902400	905920	What if we go, what if we go to their churches while they're praying and
905920	906840	we all just kneel?
907440	908040	No, no, no.
908040	909240	We're already kneeling.
909240	912320	What do they, what, what I'm curious.
912440	915440	I would like to, if I had one of them here, I was like, okay, we're
915440	916640	going to kneel during that.
916760	917920	What would you kneel?
917960	919360	I think it would be very telling.
919600	919840	Yeah.
919840	920800	I mean, Oh yeah.
920840	924040	Well, you know, their answer would be, would be amazing.
925040	929240	But the, but the general class warfare truth is that, of course, no
929240	932520	one, no one cares when an old white man kneels like the, if he, if he
932520	935120	does it, uh, let's, let's think about it.
935160	939800	This is, this is like, this is like seeds for a, a comedy.
939800	942240	I'm not going to, well, I'm not going to think about, I'm not going to
942240	945520	riff what they would think they should kneel during because it'll be a
945520	949440	list of racist shit that, because they'll be like, what do black people
949440	951000	like I'm going to do that.
951040	953040	I don't want to riff a list of what black people like.
953040	953680	No, I don't.
953680	955640	I've, I've had a hard enough year.
955800	957520	Name, just play it safe.
957760	961600	Just name like of the top 100 things you think black people would like.
961600	964840	I got a cast a widen that just put three things in there that you could
964840	969680	have said during the Oscars, you know, like the Republicans don't like
969680	972480	everything that was at liberals or black, but you said black people.
972480	974560	You said they don't like when black people kneel during the magic.
974560	977080	Well, the black people are, are, are doing the kneeling.
977080	978840	Give me three things that you're pretty confident that all black
978840	979680	people would like.
979680	981040	See he's off on that track.
981040	981600	So okay.
981600	984680	Well, I'm, I'm really back on the Republicans.
984680	986600	What do Republicans not like?
986880	990160	What do Republicans not like that they would, that they would kneel
990160	991280	while you were doing it?
991520	995680	They'd like to get a gay marriage certificate, gay marriage.
995680	996000	Okay.
996000	999360	So during a gay marriage, you know, during a game during that.
999360	1001480	And we would go, Oh, that would, that's great.
1001600	1003240	They could kneel during it.
1003240	1006080	Everybody kneel, they're pouring curate coffee.
1006120	1011360	I don't think old white people, again, the reason why young athletic
1011360	1017720	black men kneeling is, is causing a hysteria is because, uh, they're
1017720	1021240	doing it in front of everybody who might get bad ideas because everyone's
1021240	1025640	watching them because they have the power to go out and get their spines mangled.
1025640	1026360	Let's figure it out.
1026360	1027000	Let's figure it out.
1027000	1032320	What's another thing besides sports that everybody's watching?
1033640	1034960	Another thing was the news.
1034960	1039000	The Oscars, uh, the Oscars, the Nancy Grace Oscars, the Nancy Drew
1039000	1044280	mysteries pilot, that's about to air Riverdale Riverdale.
1044480	1051280	If the Riverdale people were kneeling 2.0, they could, they could kneel during
1051280	1055800	that there's probably an iron man movie coming game of thrones during game of
1055800	1056440	thrones.
1056440	1058720	Yeah, everybody could kneel during that stuff.
1058840	1061280	The fuck this is hilarious.
1061280	1062280	Rob, this is great.
1062880	1064440	So Donald Trump jr.
1064480	1070200	Like tweets like, ah, wow, that, uh, crocodile Dundee reboot looks pretty good.
1072920	1074680	It'd be like, ah, fuck me.
1076840	1077800	You shitting me.
1077800	1079960	That is the kiss of death.
1079960	1082320	We should, we should, we should have Danny McBride on here.
1082400	1083480	Yeah, he'd do it.
1083480	1085280	He's working on the hot wind trailer.
1085280	1089920	As far as I couldn't tell if it was a Toyota commercial or a, or a, uh, the
1089920	1094640	tourism ad, which it was for Australia, but it also was a tie-in to the, to
1094840	1097640	promoting this film where they're making a Dundee movie.
1097640	1098320	I don't want to shock you.
1098320	1100200	I haven't, I haven't, I haven't seen this thing.
1100200	1101200	You're talking about the super bowl.
1101200	1103960	I think they got Danny McBride and, uh, was it Hemings?
1103960	1104480	What's his name?
1104800	1105360	Chris Hemings.
1105360	1105920	Chris Hemings.
1105920	1107080	And they're doing a Paul Hogan.
1107120	1108360	They're doing, they're doing a run.
1108400	1109600	The Paul Hogan is in it.
1109960	1111360	They're doing a Dundee reboot.
1111440	1111680	Yeah.
1111680	1113560	And I'll tell you what I'm going.
1114280	1116200	I want Donald Trump jr.
1116200	1118360	He's like, enjoy your popcorn.
1118760	1121280	Putting the bib on and sharpening the fork.
1122640	1123480	I can't wait.
1123480	1125600	He's putting bibs under his eyes.
1126480	1127520	Now, what's he going to do?
1127680	1133200	What if he goes to the movie and there's Kenny Powers is not a hero.
1133200	1137080	What if he goes to the movie and he can, and in the movie, Danny McBride comes out
1137080	1139400	of a river and he wrestles a crocodile.
1139400	1143280	And then while he's wrestling it, he says like, I don't know, I'm trying to, I'm
1143280	1146720	trying to riff a joke that would be like in a comedy movie that was like, like,
1146720	1149720	like the crocodile, like bites him and runs away.
1149760	1153080	And then he goes like, oh, so you're, you're, you're going to, you're going to
1153080	1154840	take the electoral vote results, huh?
1155080	1157920	And then, and then like, so then is Donald Trump jr.
1157920	1161400	going to then get back on Twitter and go, I'd like to recant.
1161720	1163720	Like I was very disappointed.
1163760	1165040	He wouldn't express that, right?
1165040	1166520	Cause it would be an admission of weakness.
1166520	1168760	Cause it would mean that he was capable of being wrong about.
1168760	1174880	I think he would say, I was having a good time with my bros watching Danny
1174880	1184480	McBride, Dundee, and then they had to typically do this below the belt stuff
1184520	1191320	during my Danny McBride and just ruined my evening, me and my wife and my bras.
1191320	1196240	We had to get out of there and just, we just had to go home and I had to put
1196240	1199360	an ice pack on Donald Trump, and I just hated it.
1199840	1203600	You're trying to enjoy yourself in the Hollywood elite.
1203920	1212320	It's got to come on below the belt and poop all over my Danny McBride.
1212320	1218040	Johnny, you're embarrassing and it's stupid and it's entitleists and it's,
1218040	1223440	and it's, it is fucking just inappropriate.
1223480	1224320	I hate it.
1224360	1225040	I hate it.
1225680	1226200	Yes.
1226240	1226880	Eric.
1226880	1232920	Donnie, I'm just saying, get back in the car.
1232920	1234800	You're embarrassing yourself.
1235800	1236160	Okay.
1236800	1241560	I, there's an interesting point there, which is the, or the least interesting
1241560	1244840	point of all, cause you notice that it's like all this whole, like the liberal
1244840	1248200	media and the liberal entertainers and the comedians like, oh, we will, we
1248200	1251120	don't like the thing and then the, and then you notice all the, I think, I
1251120	1254760	think there is like a theme there where it's like, that is exactly how he'd react.
1254760	1259800	He'd react as if he was entitled to this movie and the, and the, and that this
1259800	1262920	horrible choice had been made that didn't have to be made.
1263120	1264760	You didn't have to go there.
1265120	1267840	Um, what a shame, which is exactly what kneeling before the anthem.
1267840	1271640	It's like, well, why do they have to, this, this game of football where my
1271640	1276640	corporation owns these gladiators who go out and mangle their spines for me.
1276680	1279320	Uh, like it was, it was perfect.
1279320	1280480	It's already fine.
1280720	1284240	Who cares that everyone doing it has this opinion.
1284240	1285960	Just get rid of that opinion.
1285960	1288560	I think that's so inconvenient and so stupid of them.
1288560	1292240	Like how, why would they want to do that to a great game like football?
1292440	1294360	They are the game of football.
1294680	1296720	Like, what are you going to do without them?
1296720	1299800	I guess you'll replace them with like worst football
1299800	1301880	players that love the national anthem.
1301880	1303240	I didn't, I didn't, I don't want sports.
1303240	1306280	Did they need, did anybody, I don't know what's going on.
1306280	1307480	I didn't see any kneeling.
1307480	1309280	There was some arm linking a couple of guys.
1309320	1311920	Uh, one guy was just like, some people looked away.
1311920	1314120	Some people didn't have their hands on their hearts, which will
1314120	1315520	probably be the next new illegal thing.
1315840	1320960	I'll tell you one thing that I found very impious, NFL, national football league.
1321520	1326240	I found Justin Timberlake's outfits with his band, a little, a little hobo-ey.
1326280	1327120	Little racy.
1327240	1328120	A little hobo-ey.
1328120	1329120	A little too much skin.
1329160	1333440	As Doug Benson, or I think it was Doug Benson said, he looked like a cowboy house
1333440	1336800	painter and his church, what was yours church?
1341920	1343040	A blood, cause he had a red one.
1343560	1344880	He had a red bandana on.
1344880	1345920	She goes, is he a blood now?
1345920	1347080	Or did he just come back from the groom?
1349320	1349920	I love that.
1349920	1351520	That's an actual like groomer thing.
1351520	1352120	Like I did.
1352120	1353920	I thought that was one groomer thing.
1353920	1359880	And then like, yeah, I don't know, like you come back with a red handkerchief on.
1360360	1363360	Uh, I'm sure here's the thing.
1363720	1371680	I'm not talking shit about, uh, about tea lakes, tea lakes, tea lakes is good.
1372440	1380000	Jay lakes, Jay, Jay lakes, uh, he put on a good fucking program and went on for a
1380000	1383760	thousand years and I feel like they recycled costumes from the last Superbowl.
1383760	1387200	Cause there was a lot of people wearing primary colors, but he did a good job.
1387200	1392640	Was the last one Lady Gaga because that motherfucker, as you can rewind to my
1392640	1397200	podcast, I, I watched the Lady Gaga performance.
1397200	1399360	I mean, he like, that's super shit.
1399360	1400600	I wouldn't follow that shit.
1400640	1400960	Yeah.
1401080	1403320	She stood up on the rim of the arena.
1403320	1407440	And then she, again, you know, I don't know if you're a fan of the podcast.
1407440	1410360	I don't want to bore you, but she dove off.
1411360	1416920	Now many, many artists have been on wires, Garth Brooks, Beyonce, uh, Peter
1416920	1425200	spider man, uh, no, I've never seen anybody do the jump on a wire and then, and then
1425200	1428480	do the fucking like creepy crawly in the air.
1428480	1432280	Like she was like, she was, she was doing, I was like, that's what I do.
1432280	1436040	If I was on a wire, I think I'd like to think she was like panicking.
1436120	1439000	Well, no, she was like, she was acting like she was falling.
1439000	1440680	You know, is that the name of it?
1440680	1443600	Was there a song or is there song has to do with falling?
1444080	1445600	It probably didn't have to do with football.
1445640	1446120	I don't know.
1446760	1447360	It doesn't matter.
1447360	1447840	What does it have?
1448440	1448640	I don't know.
1448640	1450640	I'm not going to get irritated with any of you guys tonight.
1450880	1451720	We're going to have a good time.
1452240	1453920	Dan, let's get back to why you're feeling funky.
1453920	1456880	What, what, what, why, why are you in the trough right now?
1456920	1458840	I mean, just where shrub is, it's just a sandbar.
1459440	1460520	We should be in a sandbar.
1460520	1464640	We're over 70 where we've been doing what we've been doing for a long time.
1464840	1465680	Well, it's fine.
1465680	1471160	It doesn't, it's just, it's just a, it's just a lack of, uh, things to look forward
1471160	1474000	to, you know, I had a good time, uh, Saturday.
1475360	1476240	Good time.
1476240	1476880	Good time.
1476880	1479000	You have a good time in Rob Shrobs house.
1479840	1481960	Rob, I went to Rob Shrobs house.
1482000	1483000	I was playing magic.
1483520	1484280	It was great.
1484520	1486400	Rob Shrobs went to bed pretty early.
1486880	1494720	Kate, Kate, uh, was like, I'm going to go play magic cards over my friends, uh, my
1494720	1495480	other friend's house.
1495480	1499480	And I said, why did you, uh, why don't you play over here?
1499520	1505200	And she was like, and I was like, come on, I'll be the wife and I'll make, you know,
1505200	1506560	little finger sandwiches.
1506560	1508440	This is literally a king of queens episode.
1508480	1508840	Yeah.
1508840	1509200	Yeah.
1509240	1511280	I said, oh, you know, I'll just do this.
1511280	1515880	You have your friends over and I'll just, I'll make, I'll make tacos and, you know,
1515920	1517040	I bet you made some nachos.
1517560	1518520	I didn't make nachos.
1518600	1519320	We had chips.
1519400	1520760	He made chips in a bowl.
1520880	1521080	Yeah.
1521920	1527120	And I had a great time, you know, and then once I was done with my part of it, he went
1527120	1533320	in the other room and watched Blake seven for, you know, three hours, fell asleep during
1533320	1535000	one of the episodes.
1535320	1536160	Okay.
1536440	1536960	Yeah.
1537960	1539880	Eight, 30 on a Saturday.
1539960	1540360	Yeah.
1540360	1542680	I, what do I have to stay up for?
1542880	1544200	I'm a grown person.
1544200	1546240	I can go to sleep anytime I want.
1546280	1547960	You don't got to stay up for me.
1547960	1550320	I've been awake a lot my life.
1550320	1552920	So you're saying, Robert, you weren't, you weren't excited about playing magic.
1553040	1553760	No, he didn't.
1553760	1555720	No, I just wanted to belong.
1556160	1559600	He was doing the thing, the fifties thing with the, where the wife makes sandwiches.
1559640	1562880	I had a little bell, like dang it every time.
1562920	1564400	Like the tacos were done.
1564440	1566440	He had a taco bell that he would ring.
1566680	1571480	Did you, do you, do you think Kate was, I made the tacos, but you had a taco bell.
1571960	1574760	Do you think Kate was disappointed or happy?
1574800	1576600	No, she was very happy.
1576680	1578440	I was like, let's do this from now on.
1578440	1580040	Instead of you leaving.
1580040	1583680	Spencer, didn't you post some photos so that you won the magic gathering?
1583720	1584720	We played two games.
1584720	1586200	He wins every time.
1586200	1587080	I win a fair amount.
1587080	1588680	You had like five statues of Liberty.
1588720	1589280	I couldn't tell.
1589280	1589960	I didn't zoom in.
1590040	1590480	Yeah.
1590480	1595160	I had just played five statues of Liberty, which as you know, gives you protection from
1595160	1595760	flying.
1596080	1598520	Spencer, so help me God, if I find out you get high before the show.
1599160	1602040	Oh, no, this is ice cream.
1602040	1605080	I think that's what's causing this.
1605920	1607200	I have a pint of ice.
1607240	1609760	That's that's going to be the name of your your double day book.
1610640	1613160	Yeah, I was eating ice cream.
1613280	1620880	See, Trump is having a tantrum right now because he couldn't get his hoodie off me.
1621160	1621720	The audience.
1622040	1623680	We have a question from Steve Levy.
1623680	1624320	It's not me.
1624320	1627600	The audience acquiring minds beyond meat.
1627720	1630000	Beyond meat beyond meat crumble.
1630200	1631600	What kind of cheese was it?
1631600	1634640	It was somewhere less almond cheese.
1637120	1642240	Somewhere this side of cheese proof that cheese is an artificial construct.
1642760	1643640	Dot com.
1643640	1646160	A quarter quarter till cheese cheese.
1647960	1650320	So we're short of cheese.
1650560	1653680	Dairy free cheese and necessity.
1658560	1660080	It was dairy free cheese.
1660080	1660760	Everyone loved.
1660760	1661280	Is it good?
1661280	1662560	Would it taste good?
1662560	1664080	Everybody ate them all day.
1664080	1664720	All of them.
1665720	1666280	I ate.
1666360	1667160	I ate a few.
1667160	1669680	Spencer, I didn't look too closely because it's Instagram.
1669680	1671400	You can't it's hard to zoom and see the thing.
1671400	1673920	But it looked like little little statue of Liberty heads.
1673920	1674800	They had spikes on them.
1675200	1676320	They were hellions.
1676320	1677040	Hellions.
1677040	1678880	Yeah, they're like big worms.
1678880	1680160	They have butthole mouths.
1680240	1684840	They got butthole mouths kind of they have for buttholes mouths.
1685520	1686800	Pretty straight math.
1686800	1687520	Yeah.
1688640	1692440	Well, so, Rob, you're not but you're not feeling better, right?
1692760	1694000	I'll go up and down.
1694000	1700720	You know, I don't I don't I don't want to advertise my my state of mind.
1700720	1702160	Because it just did it.
1702160	1708960	I I I I unfortunately am a needy person and then a lot of your wonderful fans
1708960	1711960	like write and say, Hey, I hope you feel better.
1711960	1716080	And and and it's nice and you get like a little jolt of oh, that feels good.
1716080	1716840	I'm being cared about.
1716840	1718280	I don't want to be addicted to that.
1718280	1722440	I don't want to be addicted to the to the to the pep talk.
1722440	1725680	So I'm I'm I'm going to try to be a little bit more private about it.
1725680	1727080	I wouldn't want to receive that.
1727080	1731680	I would I would taste that as poison, not because of their intent.
1731680	1733680	I would be like, I'm so embarrassed.
1733680	1737960	I accidentally I got so drunk I tweeted, I want out all I want is out.
1738520	1741840	Courtney Love, I don't want to be like, I don't want to be like,
1742440	1744200	yeah, direct message.
1744200	1747640	Cody, I was so I mean, that's the height of social irresponsibility.
1748000	1754000	She can take you out. Yeah, that's why she said I could be there in 20 minutes.
1754680	1757280	She I've I've done for a nice meal.
1758640	1761040	Or have you?
1761040	1763600	She or the other take is that she's been through enough
1763600	1768280	and to and to raise her alarm bells is an incredibly irresponsible waste of her empathy.
1768720	1773320	Yeah, in any case, it was very embarrassing.
1773320	1776320	I have that hits me is like, oh, shit, I fucked up at 45 years old.
1776320	1782640	Don't don't don't ever make people think that they have to waste their energy on you
1782640	1785600	that when when it's already hard enough to give it to other people.
1785600	1789920	Like I, you know, I like I like throwing pity parties for myself, but it's more like,
1790360	1793080	you know, it's like it's a pity party table.
1793080	1795480	I enjoy it. I mean, I did it.
1795680	1799560	I was just honest about it, but I don't want to get into a habit of it
1799560	1801960	because it it becomes a snowball.
1801960	1806560	You become addicted to the pep talk and and you don't you move forward to me.
1806560	1808320	I just I have to live through this.
1808320	1810920	I have to find some way to get out of it.
1813080	1817160	And I know that and and I'll be fine.
1817160	1822120	I'm I'm you know, I'm I'm I thank everybody for being concerned.
1822440	1824360	But I'm going to be OK.
1824360	1829280	Sharp came over today to he's going to he's going to test drive my iPad
1829280	1831360	Pro to see if he wants to get one himself.
1831360	1833720	I have I have two of them, too.
1833720	1836480	I got the big one and decided it was too heavy.
1836480	1837760	I like the smaller one.
1837760	1840440	Well, maybe if I like it, I could buy one of yours off of you.
1840440	1842520	I could buy one. He needs both of them.
1842520	1844560	I don't have enough respect for my money to.
1844560	1849080	Yeah, I'd rather I'd rather have my iPad Pro back and just you you go get your own.
1849440	1852040	OK, I could have done what am I going to do with that?
1852040	1856400	That that that fair market price for a twelve point nine inch iPad Pro
1856400	1858040	that I charge my friend.
1858040	1860000	Well, just give me the blue book value.
1860000	1864200	And then I'm going to I'm going to have like a stack of twenty dollar bills
1864200	1867720	that I do what with that's not going to be karmically damaging to me.
1867720	1869200	Yeah, come on. What the fuck are you?
1869200	1871360	It's a choice between giving it to you as a gift.
1871360	1874400	What could somebody do with a stack of money?
1874400	1875800	You could buy a stack of things.
1875800	1879040	You could buy a bunch of Apple pencils that your dog eats or you could
1879040	1881640	you could fucking I don't know.
1881640	1882280	That's what I'm saying.
1882280	1884920	Money's for blowing out your ass where money is a river.
1884920	1887960	Money is money is frothy. Money is a river.
1887960	1891520	It's it's it's you know, it's it's so you know, you know,
1891520	1894040	when you're swimming in in water with your friends,
1894040	1898400	you don't like take a cup of water from them like in exchange for something
1898400	1901680	for some of rock like just go get your own rock.
1902120	1903800	Fucking fucking cheap.
1903800	1905760	Yeah, they're everywhere. All right.
1905760	1909480	But you're saying you're saying you're going to buy him his own iPad Pro
1909480	1912240	or you're going to make him buy I don't need him to buy me anything.
1912240	1913800	I'd probably do that before.
1913800	1917160	I don't I don't I don't want your gifts.
1917200	1921040	He's going to he's he's a he's a he's a he's a he's a little cheapy cheapy peepy.
1921040	1924760	So he's got a cheapy cheapy as you call me.
1924960	1927240	I'm not a cheapy peepy, Dan.
1927240	1928520	Fucking take it back.
1928520	1930800	You're kind of a cheapy peepy.
1930800	1933400	I wanted to know if it worked.
1933760	1937560	We were talking on the plane and you said, well, I could let you buy.
1937560	1941600	And I let me try it out and I'll give it back and I'll buy my own.
1942120	1944760	That's not a cheapy peepy that's being smart.
1945800	1950080	Anyways, he came over to get it and I was in my underwear and he's like,
1950160	1952920	so I got the iPad and then he's like, he's like, he's like,
1952960	1955400	and I wanted me to leave so bad.
1955400	1956760	He wanted me to leave so bad.
1956760	1960720	He walked it outside, got out of his house and went.
1961720	1963080	Here, here you go.
1963080	1965320	OK. And I started walking into his house.
1966000	1971360	OK. And I don't know how we got upstairs.
1971480	1974640	And I sat down and he came into the room and was like.
1976560	1980640	So disgusted that I took a load off cheapy.
1980640	1983920	And then and then and then and then he's like,
1983920	1986520	I guess you want to drink.
1986840	1988400	OK. All right.
1988400	1989640	And then he poured me a drink.
1989640	1991880	Who's the cheapy peepy now?
1991880	1995040	I take it a sip and I'm trying to make conversation.
1995080	1999240	And he goes, he goes, so what's going on with this memo?
1999240	2000680	What's the with the memo?
2000680	2005440	And I go, well, as far as I can tell, the memo is and Cody comes in.
2005440	2007560	Cody's been sick for three days in my bed.
2007560	2010680	She emerges like with a banana and an aspirin or something.
2010880	2012520	And Rob's like, what?
2012520	2015040	Why didn't you tell me that I was interrupting something?
2015040	2017120	And Cody's like, no, no, no, you're not interrupting anything.
2017120	2019720	I want to hear about the memo, too.
2019720	2021560	I don't get the fucking memo.
2021560	2022840	That was the funny part of my day.
2023000	2026440	I accidentally found myself in the position of explaining the memo
2027440	2031480	to people that were like the rest of us all seeking clarity
2031480	2033520	on the fucking stupid ass memo.
2033520	2035960	And if you're listening to this three years in the future,
2035960	2038320	because you're catching up on 500 episodes of Harmon's.
2038320	2039800	Don't bother trying to parse it.
2039800	2043680	There was there was this point during the fucking six year remake
2043680	2049040	of the Nixon administration where this fucking sub sub sub plot
2049040	2052920	about some dude in the woods in the north of the wall
2053520	2055720	called the Nunez memo is happening.
2055720	2058600	And and and it was it was dumb.
2058600	2061560	But yeah, I can't I can't really explain that.
2061560	2063880	I mean, if you're listening to this three years in the future,
2064400	2065920	this is 2018.
2065920	2068280	This is back in a time when money was still a frothy.
2069600	2073560	And Rob was still a cheapy peepy.
2073680	2077480	I do recommend for that reason, like listen again to slow burn.
2077640	2081280	It's it takes you through the Nixon administration and it's not in a cheeky way.
2081280	2084240	It's just it's just it's a little bit comforting.
2084280	2087000	Sometimes it's a little sometimes it kind of bums you out.
2087000	2090880	But it like it's like it just it just walks you through
2092840	2096800	the six year administration of an administration kind of.
2098160	2101760	Destined to. Impeach.
2103320	2106360	And it's interesting how long it takes
2106360	2110200	and how many B stories are I was just reminded
2110200	2113520	in like the second to last episode that Spiro Agnew
2113960	2118200	was the vice president and he had to step down
2119160	2123120	because of a completely unrelated scandal
2123560	2125560	that he just had going on on the side.
2125560	2129920	He was just like he was like a money launderer and a bribe taker and stuff.
2129920	2131880	And he he got caught doing it.
2131880	2134120	And he just had to step down from the vice presidency
2134520	2139400	amid the Watergate shit like it just happened as a side order of potatoes.
2139720	2142240	Some rice balls that came to the to the table.
2142280	2145320	You think a guy with a name like Spiro Agnew would have a shit together.
2145320	2148800	Yeah, like he would like he would have built a fortress around any mistake.
2148800	2154360	He might like he would be the most reliable person to have a cybernetic hand.
2154600	2156680	Yeah, I am spirit.
2159800	2162320	Surrender to me, Spiro Agnew.
2162600	2165640	All right, Spiro Agnew is online.
2166160	2169240	I have 10 spears in my Agnew.
2170200	2170840	All right.
2170840	2175920	You are in direct deposition to the compliance of my Spiro's.
2176480	2183120	OK, I will Agnew in 10, 9, 8, 7,
2185200	2188920	6, you have five Agnew's left to Spiro
2189280	2193640	4, 3, 2, 1.
2193880	2196560	You have been in defiance of the Spiro Agnew
2197160	2201280	Tablerosa. I will now authorize to use lethal force.
2203680	2205720	Oh, oh, oh, my.
2206080	2208200	It's a little less dramatic than the two.
2208200	2209800	I knocked over my cup.
2209800	2212840	But more silent and less lethal.
2213720	2217360	Oh, I am the more superior version of my foot.
2217480	2219000	My foot. Sorry about that.
2219000	2221880	Is it is it true that you're being asked to resign from the vice presidency?
2221880	2226160	I will now step down from the vice presidency to a totally unrelated
2226160	2228200	but parallel scandal involving the White House.
2230560	2232600	And I will be replaced with Gerald Ford.
2233680	2237520	And then after Dan explaining me all this, he goes, well,
2238400	2241120	sounds like you're going through a really hard time right now
2241120	2244960	and you probably want to talk about this, but I got to deal with.
2245240	2247200	I'm going to hang out with my girlfriend.
2247200	2249560	She's sick.
2249560	2251240	That was my cue to leave.
2251240	2252080	I said, I didn't.
2252080	2256440	I hear it sounds like you're mad because you were taking his iPad pro
2256440	2258280	or I don't know what he did.
2258280	2260960	You can't believe I made such an easy target.
2260960	2263680	It's because he goes, he goes, he goes, well,
2264080	2266800	you look like you're having a hard time right now.
2266800	2268000	Wish I could help you.
2268000	2270400	But get out. It's Sunday.
2270400	2275000	That is not I don't know how I phrased it, but that is not how it went on my way out.
2275200	2276000	He's like.
2277840	2280120	Knocking on on my on my card.
2280360	2282400	Hey, we don't have a guest tonight.
2282400	2284200	Please go. No, no.
2284200	2286360	OK, let's let's make this very clear.
2286360	2287240	OK, all right.
2287240	2290800	I said actually at the top of the stairs as you descended the stairs.
2291040	2293640	By the way, we don't have a guest tonight.
2293640	2298400	You come on Harmon Town and and and and and you could barely
2298400	2303000	release your white knuckled grip on your free cheapy peepy iPad
2303360	2306480	long enough to let some blood get to your voice box
2306480	2308720	so you could emit the most big grudging.
2310440	2313440	Like, that's how you reacted to being a guest on Harmon Town,
2313640	2316520	a show that has given you stardom.
2319440	2321840	This does not feel free.
2324400	2328680	Feels like I'm paying for this iPad one way or another. Yeah.
2329680	2331720	I mean, if you get the rest of my life,
2331720	2333880	people are going to be calling me cheapy peepy.
2334280	2336040	You know what? For the rest of my life.
2336040	2337920	Steve, make a TV peepy.
2337920	2340840	Steve, can you say hashtag cheapy peepy?
2341040	2343320	Send John Mayer an iPad Pro, please.
2344040	2347280	I want I want those who contribute to be rewarded.
2350320	2352480	I feel like John Mayer is in a low place himself,
2352480	2355000	but he handles it by having the voice of a fucking angel,
2355000	2357960	an insightful, interesting commentary and the body of a
2359440	2360320	of a wonderland.
2360320	2364000	I don't know of a wonderland admissions guy.
2364040	2366680	Do you think he was do you think he was a little I mean,
2366680	2368960	I know from talking to him over pizza.
2368960	2371800	I mean, he that he he doesn't hate that song.
2371920	2374440	He just thinks it's weird and random that that's how did you.
2374440	2376480	How did you meet him? Was it randomly?
2376480	2378640	Or he came to the Rick and Morty commentary.
2378880	2380720	OK, which was kind of random.
2380720	2383560	Yeah. Was he in the audience?
2383920	2385160	There wasn't an audience.
2385160	2386160	Was he dressed as summer?
2386160	2387160	No, somebody he explained.
2387160	2388840	Pickle Ray. He knows.
2388840	2389600	Does he talk to you?
2389600	2392240	He goes, hey, how are you?
2393080	2395280	What? That's Dave Matthews.
2395280	2396600	Oh, shit.
2398520	2399880	That was a good Dave Matthews.
2399880	2401840	Hey, how are you, baby?
2401840	2407560	Do now I haven't seen you for a year or more.
2407560	2411480	So when is season four coming out now?
2411480	2413360	Huh? Season four.
2413360	2415000	He gets those kind of hurt.
2415000	2417760	You want to hear me.
2417760	2421880	Hey, when are you going to sign this contract?
2423040	2425560	When are you drawing it?
2425560	2427880	John Mayer had to have vocal cord surgery
2428880	2431760	because of whatever what he's got.
2431760	2433240	I'm not that good a friend.
2433240	2434640	Something with his throat.
2434640	2438840	He he did after after hours of me
2439400	2443480	being a goofball, trotting all over what may or may not have been its boundaries.
2443480	2446720	He did it one point just for one moment in the entire podcast.
2447000	2450800	He as a placeholder within a joke, he's like, yeah, and say, for instance,
2450800	2452680	I did say like, your body is a one.
2452680	2453840	And he like sang.
2453840	2455520	He just sang that phrase.
2455520	2457640	And I I had shivers.
2457640	2459960	And I think I think that may be just a professional vocalist.
2459960	2461920	Did you ask him?
2461920	2463040	You should have asked him to.
2463040	2465600	Can you do my voicemail message?
2465960	2467240	You know, I should have.
2467240	2468240	You didn't, though.
2468240	2469560	I never do. I never do that.
2469560	2471720	You never do. You should have.
2471720	2472560	You should have.
2472560	2474280	And what do you have said?
2474280	2476720	You would have said you would have used voicemail anymore.
2476720	2478160	Yeah. Yeah.
2478160	2479560	Yeah. And I would have said no.
2479560	2480320	What did you say?
2480320	2482120	Do people use voicemail anymore?
2482120	2484040	Yeah. And I would have said no.
2484040	2488520	Rob, if if you were John Mayer doing Dan's voicemail,
2488520	2490200	I think it would go a little something.
2490200	2491120	Well, here's it.
2491120	2492600	Well, sorry, I don't want to.
2492600	2494520	Rob, here's a test.
2494520	2496560	Because you use your voicemail so much.
2497360	2502000	Rob, you have 20 seconds to pull up
2502560	2505400	the ability for someone to leave your outgoing message
2505400	2508560	on your voicemail, which is going to be totally second nature to you
2508800	2510080	because you do voicemail.
2510080	2511640	Go, go.
2511640	2513200	Pull up your voicemail.
2513200	2514040	Pull up my voice.
2514040	2517640	Let's record your new outgoing message because you know how to bring it.
2517640	2519880	No, I like my outgoing voicemail message.
2519880	2522120	I don't want to erase it with this.
2522120	2524880	This pull it up is going to take me down
2525080	2528240	because what you need to do is put put me in my place.
2528480	2529760	Get down there. Yeah.
2529760	2531760	Take, take, take, take me down.
2531760	2534320	Hello, you have reached the offices of cheapy peepy.
2535720	2539520	I'm I'm chasing the moths that have escaped from my coin purse right now
2539520	2542680	because they might be worth money.
2542680	2544720	I think they have copper in their veins.
2544720	2547560	They ate my pennies.
2547560	2549880	I'm cheapy peepy.
2551440	2554200	I'm turning a penny into wire right now
2554200	2557480	in an adaptation of an anti-Semitic joke I heard on the playground.
2557520	2560040	Well, my wife's Jewish, so thank you.
2560040	2563160	I'll call you back after I get through slicing this bean.
2566480	2569200	Well, you know,
2569200	2571600	I don't appreciate any of this.
2573200	2575600	Look at Rob's muscly arms.
2576480	2577720	Look at that.
2577720	2581240	He's got some real muscles going on.
2581240	2583240	What's your secret, Rob?
2583240	2586040	What? Yeah, what's your secret to those muscly arms?
2586800	2589080	How do you say some lies and sinewy?
2589080	2590720	Planking, planking.
2590720	2593000	How long do you eat planks?
2593000	2596520	Eat. I can do eight planks in six notes.
2598000	2599120	Dave Klein comes over.
2599120	2602360	I've been I've been the only thing I've done right in 2018 is every
2602880	2605240	every other day since January 1st.
2606400	2608240	And now we are well into February.
2608240	2610920	I have been working out at 8 a.m.
2610920	2612880	And you can watch me do it on Instagram Live.
2612880	2614880	And Dave Klein is my personal trainer.
2615720	2620160	And so I get to wake up at eight and watch you work out.
2620200	2622920	Wow. Wow. That sounds great.
2623040	2624840	That sounds great. And this is free.
2624840	2627240	I'm expressing. Yeah, it is free. Yeah, it is free.
2627240	2628200	I don't charge for it.
2628200	2631080	Can you believe I don't monetize it? I know. I know.
2632000	2635040	This is something like what I want to do.
2635520	2637240	I wasn't telling you guys to watch me.
2637240	2639120	I was expressing pride in myself.
2639120	2643160	I'll see it like at nine or eight thirty or three p.m.
2643160	2643960	And I'll see that.
2643960	2645440	But there's no way to scrub it through.
2645440	2646680	You have to watch the whole thing.
2646680	2649320	Tap. You can go for like five minutes.
2649320	2652120	If you tap it, it just goes to the next thing.
2652360	2654800	Tap, tap, tap.
2654800	2657880	I think if you tap it, it'll it'll it'll advance like 15 seconds or something.
2659480	2660960	Doesn't matter. It's not for you guys.
2660960	2663520	But I you know, what is for you guys is my friendship.
2663520	2666400	And the self-actualized version of me that would make the best friend possible
2666400	2669680	be one who's escaped from his toxic shame through therapy, working out,
2669920	2673160	self-improvement, confronting their demons, making amends
2673160	2676960	with the numerous people he's hurt over the last decades.
2677320	2678880	You know, cool sunglasses.
2678880	2682000	Excuse me, you know, like for giving out iPads
2682000	2685000	and and just trying to take care of sick girlfriends and.
2687360	2692800	Keep going. Trying to take care of some girlfriends for a thousand winters.
2693520	2695880	I took you away.
2695880	2698480	That's it. Yeah. Yeah.
2699400	2703360	No. Wow. This shows a mess.
2703560	2706680	I got it. It's a good break from the John Mayer episode.
2706680	2707320	Like, you don't want it.
2707320	2711400	We don't want to garner a reputation for like an Olympic breaststroke.
2711440	2714240	We want to like confuse people. Let's splash around in the pool.
2715280	2718080	Is he political? Oh, he gets political.
2718240	2720920	I mean, he should he should run for mayor.
2721520	2724880	The mayor for mayor.
2724880	2725840	Yeah. Yeah.
2725840	2728560	Pound for pound. Mayor for mayor.
2729000	2731400	John Mayer. I'm John Mayer.
2733280	2736160	I think this town could use a new mayor.
2737480	2741120	Ding. Vote for mayor for mayor.
2742680	2747560	2018. There'll be a mayor in every pot
2748080	2751320	and a me for every mayor.
2751920	2755760	John Mayer. Hello, Mr. Mayor.
2756200	2757920	Yes. The debates tonight.
2757920	2759920	Are you sure you don't want to go over your platform?
2759920	2764040	I've just did. OK. Read all the cards. Oh, here we go.
2764040	2766160	You're up against some tough competitors.
2766160	2769080	Mayor Mayer, do we call you Mayor Mayer? Yes. OK.
2769760	2771720	What are their last names?
2771720	2774160	You can't you can't your competitive candidates there.
2774280	2776400	It's Senator Gold sack.
2777840	2780200	And and Congressmen.
2780520	2782000	They're both they're all running for mayor.
2782000	2782680	And this is the thing.
2782680	2785360	When a senator and a congressman run for mayor, they have
2785560	2789320	they like a lot of people say, oh, they're on the down slope.
2789360	2790240	They think they got it.
2790240	2794200	But what their last name isn't what they're trying to be.
2794240	2797280	That's true. Gold sack and Congress.
2797280	2800840	They could be a good sack all you want. Hey.
2801920	2803600	Why don't you be a gold sack?
2803600	2805560	And hours later at the debates.
2805560	2809160	Now I'm saying, what is your last name?
2810280	2812680	My last name. Yes, your last name.
2813080	2814280	It's gold sack. Yeah.
2814280	2816400	Why don't you be that? And I'll be a mayor.
2818600	2821000	I'll take that question for what it's worth with my time.
2821480	2822320	An argument could be made.
2822320	2824200	I have been a gold sack as I have proven
2824200	2826240	an effective businessman in the private sector.
2826240	2830360	And I do believe the sack as much as government is a business.
2830360	2833800	Please, please. Mayor Mayer, please.
2833800	2834840	Rolls off the tongue.
2834840	2837280	Please give Congressman the gold sack his time.
2837280	2839160	Yes, give him his time.
2839160	2840360	Open up the sack.
2840360	2841960	I was just saying.
2843440	2846840	Many of the ales from which we suffer in a as a public
2847840	2850040	government could be so you're out of order.
2852720	2854880	Answer the question. What's in the sack?
2854880	2857160	Do I get extra time?
2857160	2860880	Drain the sack. Drain the sack.
2861760	2866080	Gold sack. More like mold sack.
2867200	2871280	Smells. I believe my candidate sums up the expression.
2872280	2876520	He who has no spiros in his Agnew
2877640	2880640	boasts a tough game.
2880640	2883040	It's called soap.
2883040	2885960	Look it up. I'm not dirty.
2887160	2889080	Mold sack.
2889080	2891400	Don't talk about my hygiene, sir.
2891400	2893200	I bathe when it's appropriate.
2893200	2897480	Low, low, Jean, because you got a moldy sack.
2897480	2899400	Your jeans are moldy.
2899400	2903960	Flashback to John Goldsack's sixth grade playground.
2906120	2909400	Hey, John, you want to, you know, play some kickball again?
2910360	2912120	I would love to. Thank you.
2912120	2914120	It's about time I was invited to participate.
2914120	2915640	Or is your sack too moldy?
2915640	2918400	Yeah, what a fucking small sack.
2918400	2920120	Yeah, man, what's that green stuff on the sink?
2920120	2922880	My hygiene should be of no concern to fellow sixth graders.
2922880	2925160	I fail to understand how it affects our friendship.
2925160	2927440	Man, you got to keep those balls dry, man.
2927440	2929320	Your sack is all moldy.
2929320	2930440	Yes, all right, I get it.
2930440	2932360	I've heard every permutation of this formula.
2932360	2934160	You got to air out them.
2934160	2936840	I will clean myself when I feel dirty
2936840	2938000	and not a moment sooner.
2938000	2939640	John Goldsack.
2939640	2941680	It's me, your girlfriend, Elizabeth.
2941680	2944720	Hello. More like cold sack.
2944720	2946080	Ooh, yeah.
2946080	2947400	Yeah, this is the irony.
2947400	2949960	Emotionally, you're emotionally cold and distant,
2949960	2950800	John Goldsack.
2950800	2951920	I have unplugged emotionally
2951920	2953560	because if I'm plugged in all the time,
2953560	2956360	I'm suffering these slings and arrows from the fellow man.
2956360	2959120	Of course, it's not meant to hurt you,
2959120	2962200	but it will be my eternal plague.
2962200	2965440	I have rewired my heart to avoid abuse
2965440	2967960	and, in such, have become a form of abuser.
2967960	2969560	For that, I am sorry, Elizabeth,
2969560	2971880	and I will be sorry to every woman I will ever meet.
2971880	2975620	Or my name's not Senator John Goldsack.
2975620	2976460	Abuser.
2980100	2980940	Fuck you.
2980940	2982860	Don't ever call me dirty, you pig.
2989860	2990820	The polls are in.
2990820	2995820	Everybody wants to vote for Mayor John Goldsack.
2997580	3001700	Most of his face is calling him John Boldsack
3001700	3003860	for his bold statements.
3003860	3006180	I gotta agree with you there, Pimples.
3006180	3009220	I thought that John Mayer bursting into sobs
3009220	3012180	during his candidacy was the wrong move
3012180	3015460	at the wrong time for the wrong administration.
3015460	3016780	Back to you, Rebecca.
3018220	3020140	Hey, come down down to Rebecca's TV.
3020140	3022260	You're gonna get a free TV if you come on down
3022260	3024180	and get a loaf of bread with your free TV.
3024180	3026740	Trade in a free TV for Mattress.
3026740	3029180	I'm Rebecca, and this is my TV store.
3029180	3034180	Well, in other news, birds are falling from the sky,
3037020	3039500	suffering from some kind of mercury poisoning
3039500	3042220	that they've absorbed in the clouds.
3042220	3044620	Roger Harmanstuck has the story.
3047420	3049040	This is Roger Harmanstuck.
3050140	3052940	The expression is birds of a feather fly together,
3052940	3055340	but these birds will only fall together
3055340	3058280	as long as they keep inhaling mercury.
3058280	3063160	It seems droplets of the formerly celebrated substance
3063160	3067080	known as Quicksilver have been poisoned
3067080	3070440	by noxious fumes purportedly coming
3070440	3072400	from this factory behind me.
3072400	3074160	Yeah, that's absolutely ridiculous.
3074160	3077120	We've burned every thermometer in the building.
3077120	3082120	Bill Bill is the proprietor of Bill's Mercury Burners,
3083120	3085440	a factory that claims it is not responsible
3085440	3086600	for the mercury in the clouds.
3086600	3089140	Yes, we take, we make thermometers here,
3089140	3091200	and we realize that that's probably
3091200	3092280	where the mercury comes from,
3092280	3094440	so we took all the thermometers that we have
3094440	3095440	and we burned them.
3095440	3096900	We burned every thermometer,
3096900	3100840	and all the mercury got burned up and went away.
3100840	3102720	Went away, went up the chimney.
3102720	3105440	What do you say to the American people
3105440	3108480	when they say thermometers have mercury in them?
3109680	3111020	I think when you burn them,
3111020	3112680	the mercury goes up into the clouds.
3112680	3113880	What do I say to that?
3114840	3115680	No.
3117080	3122080	Bill continues to be good at business.
3122640	3127320	For CNBC, I'm Roger Harmanson.
3127320	3129920	Breaking news from the mercury bird crisis.
3129920	3132100	We are standing out here in a field
3132100	3134440	full of dying young chicks,
3134440	3137680	young birds who are suffering from alcohol,
3137680	3140280	from mercury, I was watching you poor fucking fucker,
3141160	3142560	mercury poisoning.
3144160	3147920	Jeff, do you want to take that again?
3147920	3148760	No, we got it.
3148760	3150600	Okay, all right.
3150600	3151440	We're live.
3151440	3152800	Roger, we're live right now.
3157520	3159840	We go now live to UCB workshops
3159840	3161560	where Basic Improv is being taught.
3163680	3166440	I'm standing outside the UCB headquarters
3166440	3167880	on Sunset Boulevard.
3167960	3170600	We're inside 25-year-old students
3170600	3172320	from around the country are learning,
3172320	3175800	give and take, denial, and question asking
3177560	3181200	in various exercises designed for sixth graders.
3181200	3182400	Candace?
3182400	3183240	What?
3185160	3187000	There's no Candace here.
3187000	3187840	No way.
3189840	3191560	You're just putting your finger in your ear.
3191560	3193000	That's not even a microphone.
3193000	3195680	Why are you sitting during an interview anyway
3195680	3199040	outside UCB in Burbank 25?
3200480	3203080	I want to do a Star Wars reference.
3205000	3206920	Here to comment, Matt Besser.
3212960	3214440	I've got a penguin on my head.
3214440	3215480	Don't say no.
3216960	3217960	Let's stop, let's stop.
3217960	3221400	Yeah, I mean, we're too good for this.
3222600	3225520	I mean, your New England Patriots lost today.
3225680	3228160	I can't imagine the state that you're in, Spencer.
3228160	3229600	Oh, yeah.
3229600	3234600	It's okay, because we have all that other wins.
3236120	3238200	Remember all those times we cheated?
3238200	3239880	We'll always have those.
3241160	3242000	You cheated?
3242000	3243600	Did I see Donald Glover in a commercial
3243600	3244520	for a big-ass movie?
3244520	3245440	Like, is he gonna be in Han Solo?
3245440	3248200	He's Han Solo's friend Lando Calrissian.
3248200	3249320	He's playing Young Lando?
3249320	3250280	He's playing Young Lando.
3250280	3252200	Directed by Ron Howard.
3252200	3253840	Wow, shit.
3253840	3258520	Now, because our old friends got fired
3258520	3260960	and replaced with my new friend, Ron Howard.
3260960	3261860	Hell yeah.
3263040	3264880	Who were the old friends?
3264880	3265720	Lord and Miller.
3265720	3266560	Regis.
3266560	3267800	Never met him.
3267800	3269120	But love him.
3269120	3270440	They're great.
3270440	3271280	Good friend knows him.
3271280	3273120	Good friends, I like him.
3273120	3275600	That's pretty badass to play Young Lando Calrissian.
3275600	3277720	You think he's gonna call him Han,
3277720	3278960	like he does in the movies?
3278960	3280280	Han, you old pirate.
3280280	3283000	Han, everyone else calls him Han.
3283000	3284160	You must have heard about my little maneuver
3284160	3285680	back at the Battle of Tanab.
3287280	3289600	Han Solo, you old pirate.
3290800	3293920	I'm just doing my impression of your impression.
3294960	3295800	I like it.
3295800	3298880	Jeff Davis, that impression of Billy Dee Williams
3298880	3300680	is fantastic.
3300680	3305560	Dan Harmon, your impression of me doing Lando Calrissian
3305560	3308840	is a bad impression of Howard Cosell.
3308840	3311240	Jeff Davis, your Howard Cosell
3311240	3312760	sounds like Catherine Hepburn.
3313000	3313840	You won't poop.
3317840	3318680	Oh, Rob.
3320440	3322200	Could you do,
3322200	3323400	this is a tough ask.
3323400	3324560	You can say no.
3324560	3326320	This is not a UCB class.
3326320	3329120	Do you think you could do Dave Matthews Band
3329120	3331400	but sung as Catherine Hepburn?
3331400	3333560	Could you combine those two things?
3333560	3334400	Yeah, okay.
3336280	3340760	He, ha, ho, he, ha, ha, me, oh.
3340760	3345760	He, ha, ho, he, ha, he, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.
3345800	3347920	Yeah, I mean, it's not,
3347920	3348840	the question you should have asked
3348840	3350200	is would it be entertaining.
3350200	3353160	I still don't know who Dave Matthews Band is.
3353160	3355160	I'm sure if I heard a song that it's an actual song.
3355160	3356000	Oh, yeah.
3356000	3358160	I swear to God, that's the closest I could come to Evens.
3358160	3359720	It's not, they don't have a hook.
3359720	3362440	They were the band that their bus took a poop off a bridge
3362440	3363280	on people, right?
3363280	3364120	Yeah.
3364120	3365560	Bring up Steve Levy so he can.
3365560	3366400	Hell yeah.
3366400	3367240	Steve Levy.
3367240	3369120	Their bus took a poop off a bridge?
3369120	3369960	Yeah.
3370960	3373320	Steve Levy for the DMV rebuttal.
3374320	3379320	DMV, DMV, DMV, DMV, rebuttal.
3382400	3385160	DMV, gotta love those DMVs.
3385160	3387160	DMX, DMV.
3387160	3389400	I'm not being a jerk or provocative right now, Levy.
3389400	3392760	Talk me into, give me your eyes
3392760	3395320	into my possible love of,
3395320	3398760	or at least interests in Dave Matthews Band.
3398760	3400040	And after you do that,
3400040	3402560	could you please book six black women for next week's show?
3402560	3404400	Jesus Christ.
3404400	3407080	Yeah, Steve, come on.
3407080	3410400	We keep trying to book diverse guests
3410400	3414160	and Steve keeps telling us it's not gonna happen.
3414160	3415080	It's crazy.
3415080	3416720	At this point, it's crazy.
3416720	3418400	It's been two years.
3418400	3419240	It's crazy.
3419240	3420320	It's not our fault.
3420320	3421560	It's Steve Levy.
3421560	3423000	At this point, it's just malfeasance
3423000	3426000	because how many church, you and I,
3426000	3427360	we're emailing him all day long
3427360	3429000	about getting some diversity up on the street.
3429000	3432240	He says that, he says he's not getting them.
3432240	3434120	Sweetie, we can't hear you, you're not mic'd.
3434120	3436160	We gotta get more women up here.
3436160	3437080	First of all.
3438920	3441320	No, tell us about what, yeah, go back to the TV.
3441320	3445840	So, I broke a record at my gym this weekend.
3445840	3446960	A PR?
3446960	3447800	Wait, what?
3447800	3448880	Yeah.
3448880	3453880	I was, I planked for two minutes straight
3454040	3455840	with a 45 pound weight on my back.
3455840	3457240	So cool.
3457720	3458560	Thanks, Rob.
3458560	3460400	You can put weight out now, that is pretty cool.
3460400	3461840	What did you do, you put a weight on your back?
3461840	3465400	Put a 45 pound weight plate on my back
3465400	3466800	and planked for two minutes straight.
3466800	3469080	Was it an elbow plank, some of your elbows or?
3469080	3470000	Yeah, elbow.
3470000	3472520	Am I allowed to do this as a constitutional violation
3472520	3476160	if I say, Steve, I'm getting into self care,
3476160	3478880	so I need you to get fat and be slovenly
3478880	3481800	because otherwise, what is this?
3481800	3484680	Jeff's actually looking pretty good lately, too.
3484720	3487960	I went to my first spin class today in 45 years.
3487960	3491840	I feel like a bag of smashed assholes, I'm fucking wrecked.
3491840	3493800	That fucking hurts, when you don't go for a while,
3493800	3496520	it's fucking thirsty work.
3496520	3501520	So, could you plank with 45 pounds on your back?
3501640	3502480	Yes.
3502480	3504200	Could you cuddle me?
3505280	3506440	In a plank?
3506440	3507280	I could cuddle you.
3507280	3508120	Okay, good.
3508120	3510280	Okay, Rob, lay down on your back.
3510280	3511120	Okay.
3511120	3511960	And then.
3511960	3513640	How many planks adds up to one push up,
3513640	3514480	because I'm up to eight.
3514480	3515320	Okay, and then.
3515320	3516160	No, no, no, no, on your back.
3516160	3519440	Lay flat on your back so he can plank on you.
3519440	3522480	Well, okay, can you plank over Shroff when he's in there?
3522480	3523320	No.
3523320	3527560	No, wait, no, he's gonna plank on you.
3528840	3530600	I'm gonna be the 45 pound weight.
3530600	3534480	This isn't, why is this, what is this supposed to be doing?
3534480	3536600	Well, it should be miked.
3536600	3537840	Wait, no, no, no, no, stay down there.
3537840	3538680	Let's let's let's let's let's talk it out.
3538680	3543360	Five dollars gets you Steve and Rob Shroff spooning on stage.
3543960	3544960	This is all I wanted.
3544960	3546120	This is all I wanted.
3546960	3548480	It's all I wanted.
3548480	3550280	They got nappy time lights.
3550280	3551120	Okay.
3551120	3552320	And microphones.
3552320	3553680	Rob, you're very comfy.
3553680	3554520	See?
3554520	3555360	I love you very much.
3555360	3556640	She's got big shoulders.
3556640	3557480	They both got big shoulders.
3557480	3558920	You make me laugh a lot.
3558920	3559760	I appreciate that.
3559760	3560600	You make me laugh.
3560600	3563440	Thank you for helping Kate and I out on Thursday.
3563440	3564760	Oh yeah, that was fun.
3564760	3566040	Kate wrote a good script.
3566040	3567440	Yeah, she's very talented.
3567440	3568880	It's gonna get much better too.
3568880	3570240	She deserves better.
3570240	3571200	Yeah, let's make that movie.
3571200	3572640	If she wrote a great script,
3572640	3574280	what do you mean it's gonna get much better?
3574280	3577440	Well, she she we gave her a bunch of notes.
3577440	3578960	What do you give notes in a great script for?
3578960	3580320	What are you a fucking asshole?
3580320	3584280	Yeah, that's that's not what are you doing?
3584280	3585200	What are you doing over here?
3585200	3587240	I'm supervising and I needed to grab a mic
3587240	3589400	because I gave him I gave a lot to my mic.
3589400	3590960	Why are you always giving things and being characters?
3590960	3592960	Why do you have to why do you have to cuddlesplain?
3592960	3594880	Why can't this work itself out?
3594880	3596520	I make such an easy target.
3596520	3598040	It should be called easy target.
3598040	3599120	Would you look at what's happening right now?
3599120	3601680	Now you're looming over them like like like like all right.
3601760	3603160	I'm like Odin.
3604080	3606040	Rob, what's your biggest fear?
3606040	3607280	My biggest fear?
3607280	3608120	Yeah.
3608120	3610440	Being forgotten.
3612000	3615080	Is that why you're in the entertainment business?
3615080	3617120	No, that's why I'm here tonight.
3617120	3618560	On the stage?
3618560	3619440	With you guys.
3619440	3620280	Yeah.
3620280	3621120	Okay.
3623280	3624120	Keep going.
3624120	3625040	That was quite a sigh.
3625040	3625880	Yeah.
3625880	3626880	You okay?
3626880	3628040	Yeah, I'm fine.
3628040	3628880	This is amazing.
3628880	3629880	What are you thinking of that?
3629880	3630920	What am I thinking about?
3630920	3631760	Yeah.
3631760	3632600	Ew.
3632600	3633440	What about me?
3636840	3637680	You ever see?
3637680	3639480	Did you see that army hammer movie?
3639480	3640840	No.
3640840	3642240	It was really good.
3642240	3643080	We should watch it.
3643080	3644320	Dan, turn me away from it.
3648880	3650040	Keep going, keep going, keep going.
3650040	3652240	I don't think that's appropriate music.
3652240	3654040	No, it's too groovy.
3654040	3655280	What's that movie?
3655280	3659240	What's that movie that call me, call me by your name?
3659240	3664240	So Kate goes, hey, let's watch some screeners.
3665240	3667520	I was like, okay, well, we've seen, seen.
3667520	3668600	What do we have left?
3668600	3670920	And she goes, well, let's go watch this,
3670920	3671880	call me by your name.
3671880	3673240	And I'm like, oh, what's it about?
3673240	3675040	And she's like, I don't know.
3675040	3676240	And I'm like, okay, all right.
3676240	3680560	Well, I heard army hammers and he's good and it's okay.
3680560	3682160	Let's check, let's check it out.
3682160	3685920	Watch it, you know, and it's about this,
3685960	3690960	this older man, like falling in love with this young boy.
3692240	3693800	Uh-oh, 17.
3693800	3696760	17, 16 actually, I think.
3696760	3701760	And, and, and, and I'm like, okay, all right, fine.
3703080	3704480	All right, whatever.
3704480	3707160	I'm a little uncomfortable because the kid's under age
3707160	3709880	and it's very romantic.
3709880	3713880	Then when it gets to the child fucking, 17.
3716880	3717720	17.
3717720	3720720	I'm not defending child fucking, keep going, keep going.
3720720	3724040	Just, I, I, I'm sitting there watching it.
3724040	3726520	I turn, turn to Kate on the couch.
3726520	3727520	She's fast asleep.
3727520	3732160	So now I'm just, just me sitting alone in a bed
3732160	3737160	in the living room watching this man romanticize this child,
3740560	3744560	this boy and it's all romantic.
3744560	3748040	And it's all like indie film with good actors
3748040	3750320	and like going, it's like, nah, nah, nah, nah.
3750320	3751160	It's all great.
3751160	3753560	And it's fun, but it's, you had already,
3753560	3755520	you told me that story and the funny thing about it
3755520	3756800	and I'm just saying, because it's like,
3756800	3758800	when you were explaining it to me, you were like,
3758800	3762560	you were so, you so wanted Kate to, to,
3763560	3768240	to know that you were a thoughtful Academy Award
3768240	3773240	considering advocate of, of progress in the future
3773440	3774280	and that you weren't.
3774840	3776560	You were afraid to like, you were like,
3776560	3779440	your eyes are glued on the screen and she's behind you
3779440	3782520	on the couch and like, and so you're like, you know,
3782520	3785760	you're afraid to like, kind of like send any overtures
3785760	3790000	of like, of like looking at your bathroom,
3790000	3792200	but I held it in because I was like, well,
3792200	3795160	if I get up now I'm, I'm homophobic or whatever.
3795160	3798120	So I'm going to watch this being uncomfortable
3798120	3800480	and I'm just like, you know, and I look,
3800480	3801600	she's fast asleep.
3801600	3804240	She was probably fast asleep throughout the whole thing.
3805080	3805920	She probably fell asleep.
3805920	3806760	She fell asleep.
3806760	3810160	She fell, I, I, I, it was the funny thing about the movie
3810160	3812760	was that I, I, Cody and I kept going like,
3812760	3815600	well, I get, I just, my part of this exercise might be
3815600	3819560	that straight people are supposed to like experience
3819560	3822520	like getting frustrated that gay people
3822520	3825480	haven't gotten down yet because we were like,
3825480	3828480	we were like, if this was the broke back guys
3828480	3831320	would be on their third broke back by now.
3831320	3833720	It takes them two hours to, to
3834680	3837880	to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to do it.
3837880	3840280	I don't want to spoil call me by your name.
3840280	3841560	There's absolutely no question.
3841560	3843600	Once in a while a movie comes along where you're like,
3843600	3846040	Jesus Christ, obviously the director is very talented.
3846040	3847280	The actors are amazing.
3847280	3850200	That kid is giving like the performance of a lifetime.
3850200	3853920	Like, that's not funny.
3853920	3855320	It's not funny.
3855320	3856760	It's not funny.
3856760	3857760	It's not funny.
3857760	3860720	No, cause that's just, that's just a straight up funny.
3860720	3862800	He's giving the performance of the lifetime
3862800	3865160	and he's taking the performance of a lifetime.
3865160	3866000	That's not funny.
3866000	3867200	I'm seeing that's hack.
3867200	3869720	We got to be smiling.
3869720	3871120	Well, because I'm smiling.
3871120	3872320	Cause you're yelling at me.
3875760	3876960	It's not hack.
3876960	3878440	It's brilliant.
3878440	3881040	It's the funniest joke ever.
3881040	3884600	Yeah. I've never been, find your camera.
3884600	3888840	I've never, I've never, I've never wanted a more gay sex
3888840	3893200	to happen more quickly in my, in a movie in my life.
3893200	3894600	You were just bored.
3894600	3895680	That's what I'm saying.
3895680	3897600	I was just like, God boy, they really,
3897600	3900080	this is a slow burn in this movie.
3900080	3902120	Have you guys ever been on a nude beach?
3904360	3906080	Just topless.
3906080	3906920	Just topless?
3906920	3907760	Just the men.
3907760	3910040	I think I, me and my family on vacation one time
3910040	3911760	kind of stumbled upon one in Hawaii
3911760	3914240	and we just kind of hung a U-turn.
3914240	3916480	Today I was in La Jolla.
3916480	3917480	You know La Jolla?
3917480	3918800	I do.
3919760	3921120	It's Spanish for La Jolla.
3922360	3924080	Yeah, that's correct.
3924080	3925080	La Jolla, Jack.
3925080	3930080	They have, Torrey Pines State Park has this like big,
3931040	3936040	it's on the top of this big cliff
3936040	3937440	and they do gliders.
3937440	3940240	Like people are paragliding and parachuting off this cliff
3940240	3941600	and we're at the top of the cliff,
3941600	3943600	watching these people jump off the mountain,
3943600	3944440	which is pretty cool.
3944440	3945880	And we went, wouldn't it be cooler
3945880	3947880	if we went to the bottom of this cliff
3947880	3949960	to see the people jump off the hill?
3949960	3951000	And we were like, sure.
3951000	3955200	We hiked down this cliff to the beach
3955200	3957040	and as soon as we got on the beach,
3957040	3959200	we realized everyone was naked.
3959200	3960600	Even the hand gliders?
3960600	3962400	No, not the hand gliders.
3964000	3964880	I've been thinking about it.
3964880	3966080	The important thing about the movie
3966080	3969920	is that it's the emotional aspect of,
3969920	3971600	the fact that I'm straight and I'm going like,
3971600	3973400	hurry up and fuck each other already.
3973400	3975640	I'm like, oh, I want to define.
3975640	3976840	More foot rubbing.
3976840	3977680	It's a symbol for that.
3977760	3980360	I want to define homosexuality by the act.
3980360	3982280	That's what we've done throughout society
3982280	3983680	because then we define it by the act
3983680	3985280	and then we criminalize the act, all these things.
3985280	3987640	It's like, people can be in love, they are every day,
3987640	3990200	without anybody admitting it or knowing it
3990200	3992320	or all those things like everybody's,
3992320	3994120	I love that movie now.
3994120	3994960	Good save.
3996960	3999080	He was underage.
3999080	4000040	He was underage.
4000040	4001680	Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to say any.
4001680	4003320	Everybody goes, yeah, but it's France.
4003320	4004800	I did find that kind of fascinating though
4004840	4007880	because I'm very happy to be done with,
4007880	4010760	have Milo Yiannopoulos be out of the picture,
4010760	4014760	but isn't that kind of what he was gay-splaining
4014760	4017360	on the Rogan show or whatever?
4017360	4019800	When he finally, we found his off switch
4019800	4022160	and his off switch was that he was technically
4022160	4026540	in favor of whatever because wasn't his whole monologue
4026540	4028320	just about the fact that when you're gay,
4028320	4030880	because you're already taboo and you're not,
4030880	4032480	there is no prom night for you
4032480	4036200	and there is no rigorously set up rails to your sexuality
4036200	4040080	that the way that you often encounter your sexuality
4040080	4043600	is through the indoctrination of people.
4043600	4047120	It's like, I couldn't love the guy for him.
4047120	4048760	I'm so happy that something brought him down.
4048760	4049840	I just find it ironic.
4049840	4051360	Is that how it happens, Dan?
4051360	4053480	That's how it happens.
4053480	4054320	That's not funny.
4058440	4060960	Have you guys ever seen videos of people skydiving naked?
4060960	4063000	It's pretty funny because everything's just flippin'
4063000	4064160	and flappin' and flappin'.
4064160	4065000	So you went?
4065000	4065840	Mine wouldn't.
4065840	4072160	You walked down here and you're like, hey, I was checking out
4072160	4075200	all the hang gliders.
4075200	4078160	Your giant balls skydiving space, it would be a spectacle.
4078160	4081320	I could use them as a parachute.
4081320	4082400	You think you could?
4082400	4084440	Did you talk to anybody down there?
4084440	4086320	Like one of those flying squirrel, like Red Bull,
4086320	4089000	like wing suits, so you could just stretch your balls up.
4089000	4089920	Yeah, I could.
4089920	4091680	Like a V-wing and just lend?
4091680	4092880	Yeah.
4092880	4096640	I could also stretch it over my whole body.
4096640	4099280	My privates at normal room temperature
4099280	4107320	look like a big pair of balls.
4107320	4112480	And then at the top of them, it's just like a little nipple
4112480	4114520	coming out of fun time Harry.
4114520	4116200	I'm just like, hey, look, I'm not
4116200	4118600	going to make a fuss unless anybody wants me out here.
4118920	4121320	Do you think your balls are doing your dick a disservice
4121320	4124360	by putting your dick into that high a contrast
4124360	4125280	because they're that big?
4125280	4128080	Yeah, I can't tell if it's an illusion.
4128080	4131400	It's like, wow, those are big balls.
4131400	4133240	I've seen the photo that Cody took of you
4133240	4134880	with your balls hanging out that we keep
4134880	4136040	torturing Steve Levy with.
4136040	4137240	Yeah.
4137240	4141320	Your balls are the size of lemons.
4141320	4142320	Is that big?
4142320	4143320	Huh?
4143320	4147000	Yes, I mean, I would say, yes, bigger than mine.
4147000	4150280	And they're certainly big for a guy whose dick is a nipple.
4150280	4153560	Yeah, because it's like, what is the point of this?
4153560	4156320	What is being generated in those balls?
4156320	4157040	It feels weird.
4157040	4159040	It's like if the fire department came up
4159040	4161960	and they had like a giant water tank on their fire truck,
4161960	4163960	and then they took out a little Capri Sun straw.
4163960	4166160	And they're like, don't worry, ma'am.
4166160	4167760	We'll have your house safe in a second.
4167760	4168680	You're like, what?
4168680	4169200	I don't.
4169200	4170920	I appreciate the effort, but it'd
4170920	4173480	be like if the fire truck pulled up and they're like,
4173480	4176800	all right, let's get out the hose.
4176800	4177920	Right, something like that.
4177920	4179320	I don't know what the metaphor is.
4179320	4181480	I know it breaks down, because it's like it's not a dick's job
4181480	4183680	to like pour a bunch of cum into it.
4183680	4185520	All right, let's kind of literally do this job.
4185520	4189440	Let's put out this fire.
4189440	4191520	Yeah.
4191520	4195080	He's miming like a hose that's not one enough.
4195080	4198080	It's moments like this when I wonder why, more than ever,
4198080	4202520	we don't get a bunch of black women on our show to talk about it.
4202520	4206080	This seems like the perfect platform to discuss some of his issues.
4206840	4208000	It's the perfect segue to do.
4208000	4208880	It was supposed to be.
4208880	4210800	I'll book a black woman, for sure.
4210800	4212240	If not for Steve.
4212240	4213880	No, no, it's Sklar's next week.
4213880	4215840	Yeah, there's always a next week.
4215840	4219640	The week after, I will have a great black writer.
4219640	4221240	Always the week after.
4221240	4222880	It was just 9-11.
4222880	4225200	I bet I could wear this chair as a shirt.
4225200	4225920	It's 9-12 now.
4225920	4226800	It's 9-12.
4226800	4229720	It's 9-12.
4229720	4231160	I don't want.
4231160	4232680	This can't happen.
4232680	4234960	We're going to have to call the fire department.
4234960	4236040	Please do it.
4236040	4238040	Don't ever stop doing what you're doing.
4238040	4239760	Where's church when we need it for photos?
4239760	4243920	Chris, can you 3D print a saw?
4243920	4246200	Yeah, we're going to need one.
4246200	4249600	Shrav has shoved his head to the back of a folding chair.
4249600	4251480	And for real, I saw it go through.
4251480	4252840	And you can tell it won't come off.
4252840	4253880	It's not going to come off.
4253880	4258920	Because his ears are like the, that's how arrows are designed.
4258920	4261280	You're not supposed to be able to pull an arrow out.
4261280	4264880	The metal tubing that's used to form the structural frame
4264960	4267320	of the chair is not strong enough.
4267320	4268880	Like, it would be easy to cut.
4268880	4271000	But it wouldn't be comfortable to do so.
4271000	4274160	But also, what you can't see, even in photographs,
4274160	4277400	is the fact that everyone had to photograph it.
4277400	4281800	Because it was clearly an act that was done for it.
4281800	4283360	There was no reason for him to do it.
4283360	4283840	It just.
4291760	4294440	He's drinking a cup that was placed on the chair
4294480	4295560	like a cup holder.
4295560	4299240	And clothes, and he had to wear furniture for shirts.
4299240	4302240	Oh, that would be crazy.
4302240	4305320	It would be just like this, I think.
4305320	4307320	But that's great, because you can put your drink down
4307320	4308720	right by your face.
4308720	4310920	It would make sense, like in an apocalyptic world,
4310920	4314600	because there would be no place for anyone to sit down
4314600	4315840	right before the apocalypse.
4315840	4317560	And then there would be like a bunch of empty chairs,
4317560	4318880	because the apocalypse happened.
4318880	4321200	But there'd be nobody making clothes.
4321200	4323120	And then so everyone's walking around wearing chairs,
4323120	4324320	and couches, and stuff.
4325200	4326720	All the rich people will be wearing
4326720	4327800	barrels with suspenders.
4327800	4329920	But this is a very poor guy.
4329920	4331560	You guys are laughing at me, but I'm
4331560	4335680	all ready for Mad Max Road Warrior.
4335680	4337520	Yeah.
4337520	4343560	Like everybody's like, I'm like the gyrocopter guy.
4343560	4346320	I think your Mad Max character will be called the chairman.
4346320	4347440	Yes.
4347440	4348480	The chairman.
4348480	4351920	All right, stockholders!
4351920	4354600	Grab your primary chairs!
4354600	4357520	There's going to be a merger of blood!
4357520	4358920	Right, OK, right.
4358920	4361600	OK, well, what do we have there?
4361600	4364240	Oh, it's the chairman!
4364240	4365000	Good luck.
4365000	4370040	We're going to have some gasoline, don't we?
4370040	4373360	The chairman recognizes carnage!
4373360	4375240	Thank you.
4375240	4376240	Thank you.
4376240	4379880	I think I'm going to be taking a vehicle from you.
4379880	4384200	Well, there you are, Mr. Maday.
4384200	4386760	Oh, well, I'm very tired.
4386760	4388400	I think I'll take a load off.
4392360	4394800	You have my attention.
4394800	4396960	What do we have going on over here?
4396960	4398360	Oh, shit!
4398360	4402160	The chair recognizes.
4402160	4405640	Stool, stool.
4405640	4407000	Stool head.
4407000	4408280	Stool.
4408280	4410160	Stool head!
4410160	4413120	What he lacks in imagination for names,
4413120	4416720	he makes up for in blood!
4416720	4419840	When your ball would have thought he'd stool on your head,
4419840	4420960	you don't got to.
4420960	4422160	Oh, shit.
4422160	4422720	I knew it.
4422720	4423480	We knew it.
4423480	4424000	We knew it.
4424000	4425840	I knew his head wasn't coming out of there.
4425840	4428080	For real, we have to fucking.
4428080	4430080	Why don't we table this meeting until tomorrow?
4433080	4434920	We've got a safety issue.
4434920	4437600	He's trying to hold his ear flat enough
4437600	4440720	against his head with his hand, which makes his head twice as wide.
4440720	4443040	He's going to rip his ears off.
4443040	4443800	Don't help him.
4443800	4444560	Don't help him.
4444560	4447080	Helping him is hurting him.
4447080	4449360	What if you tuck the chair?
4449360	4450480	Can you tuck the chair?
4450480	4451480	Well, at least mic him.
4451480	4453360	Mic him for the free listeners.
4453360	4456720	They might be inspired to subscribe.
4456720	4457960	He's past the ear.
4457960	4459920	By the way, this is brought to you by Quip Toothbrushes,
4459920	4462480	the toothbrush that vibrates when you use it.
4462480	4464720	Quip Toothbrushes come with a suction sticker thing.
4464720	4465520	It goes in your mirror.
4465520	4467160	They stick right to the mirror.
4467160	4468960	There's no dirty charger.
4468960	4470760	They said it couldn't be done.
4470760	4472840	He's out.
4472840	4476800	And so are your teeth if you don't use Quip.
4476800	4481880	I wore a chair as a shirt.
4481880	4485440	That's what it would be like if people wore furniture as clothes
4485440	4487640	because they ran out of clothes.
4487640	4491680	Listen, man, I've been a listener of your podcast for a long time.
4491680	4492520	Yeah, I have.
4492520	4498840	I would like a refund.
4498840	4500640	Rob's got the mic.
4500640	4501160	Oh, shit.
4501160	4503160	That's oh, it's not Rob talking to it.
4503160	4504560	Hello. Hi.
4504560	4505640	No, I think it might be leaving.
4505640	4506360	Hi. Hello.
4506360	4507120	What?
4507120	4508120	No. Hello.
4508120	4509160	Oh, no.
4509160	4510560	What about that one?
4510560	4513400	Hello. Hello.
4513400	4515840	Hello. Hello.
4515840	4517520	Hello. Hi.
4517520	4519240	Hello. Hi.
4519240	4522480	Hello. Hi.
4522840	4524600	I just turned it all the way down.
4524600	4529000	And the result is Rob sounds like Paul Rudd.
4529000	4532840	Hello. Hi.
4532840	4534280	All right.
4534280	4534880	That was good.
4534880	4536960	I don't work good with magic.
4536960	4541000	I don't think you're going to get John Mayer up here
4541000	4544240	and fucking put furniture on and fucking do a Mad Max get.
4544240	4548880	I bet you he would stop just short of putting it on
4548880	4550760	wearing a chair as a shirt.
4550760	4552480	I think it was antics like that that got him
4552480	4554000	in that hot water in the first place.
4554000	4556120	And he's now he doesn't have the courage
4556120	4558840	to start wearing furniture on podcasts.
4558840	4560160	I'm touched by your envy.
4560160	4561920	I wish you could express it in a more healthy way
4561920	4564160	than attacking him or me.
4564160	4570760	I think it's nice that I had a brief moment of friendship
4570760	4576120	with a guy that, you know, like, laugh all you want, I think.
4576120	4577720	We'll make more.
4577720	4579280	You guys are still friends, I think.
4579280	4580920	Yeah, but I probably already smothered him
4580920	4583280	by mentioning him too much during my workout.
4583280	4584960	Yeah, he hated that.
4584960	4585880	I'm pretty shit now.
4585880	4587400	He's got dust all over him.
4587400	4589480	Oh, boy.
4589480	4591840	Oh, you got lacquer all over your back.
4591840	4594040	You what?
4594040	4594560	Back lacquer?
4594560	4595440	Backer.
4595440	4598440	You got stool resin.
4601080	4604040	I don't think you guys really gave my character stool head
4604040	4606120	the time to really flesh that character out.
4606120	4609400	I think it was the highlight of the evening.
4609400	4611240	I think we did a lot of things wrong tonight.
4611240	4613840	That was probably number 50 on the list.
4613840	4616360	I don't regret a goddamn bit of it.
4616360	4621600	I think people at NASCAR, people go to NASCAR every week.
4621600	4622400	What's that?
4622400	4623640	Cars running in a circle.
4623640	4625560	You're only really there in case there's a crash.
4625560	4626920	Like, no one wants to admit it.
4626920	4627960	Sometimes there's a crash.
4627960	4629760	Sometimes a crash is exciting.
4629760	4631260	You know, what are you going to watch?
4631260	4633320	A car go around in a circle faster?
4633320	4634280	Whatever.
4634280	4636000	Like, I'm not being defensive.
4636520	4640160	I'm saying to our subscribers, I think this was worth it.
4640160	4642960	I think this trick, this has been our fucking Japanese jet
4642960	4644760	train to fucking Fun Town.
4644760	4645920	Yeah.
4645920	4646520	What time is it?
4646520	4647560	Usually on the clock.
4647560	4649720	I wore these glasses just so I could read the clock.
4649720	4650320	What?
4650320	4651680	Hit the beat.
4651680	4652480	What?
4652480	4653640	D&D?
4653640	4654720	No.
4654720	4656160	It's 19.
4656160	4658240	It's 9.19 right now.
4658240	4660920	That seems like a good, solid time to play D&D for.
4660920	4661600	Let's do this.
4661600	4663080	Let's do it for real.
4663080	4663760	Oh, shit.
4663760	4665480	Spencer, you got the folders?
4665480	4666480	You got the goods?
4666480	4667000	I will.
4667000	4668960	You got the matz?
4668960	4669960	Matz?
4669960	4671040	Spencer got the matz.
4671040	4672880	Matz-a?
4672880	4675440	Matz-a.
4675440	4679200	How do you guys celebrate the Jewish festivals?
4679200	4680480	Like, in full Jewish fashion?
4680480	4683640	Do you guys really keep the shabbos and the shabbos
4683640	4684600	and whatever you call them?
4684600	4685200	The shabbos.
4685200	4686200	The shabbos.
4686200	4686960	I'm making things up.
4686960	4687800	I don't know what I'm talking about.
4687800	4688640	Are you guys the?
4688640	4690720	Shabbos are when people die.
4690720	4693560	But you guys, did you mean the Jews?
4693560	4695280	Yeah, I did.
4695320	4697280	Levi, what's a Maccabee?
4697280	4702440	The Maccabees or the Army.
4702440	4703720	They were like warriors, right?
4703720	4704560	Yeah, the warriors.
4704560	4705960	And they kicked a bunch of ass.
4705960	4706480	Yeah, they did.
4706480	4706960	Yeah.
4706960	4709560	Yeah, but what's this one?
4709560	4711240	It's extra.
4711240	4712800	Are you keeping something from us?
4712800	4713640	No.
4713640	4714520	What does he know that?
4714520	4715400	I don't know.
4715400	4716000	I don't know.
4719800	4724960	I don't think we ever learned about Dave Matthews' band, which
4724960	4729240	was the whole premise of bringing Steve home.
4729240	4731680	Where did he get the name from?
4731680	4734440	They got the name because Dave was a bartender
4734440	4738920	at this bar in downtown Mall Charlottesville.
4738920	4742000	It's called Miller's Bar.
4742000	4742920	He's a bartender.
4742920	4744880	And Matthew's Bar.
4744880	4748040	Everyone knew Dave because he's a friendly guy.
4748040	4749480	And that was the local establishment.
4749480	4751440	It's like the drawing room there.
4751440	4754880	And people would play live music there.
4755120	4757840	And he started playing and getting all these musicians
4757840	4759080	to play with him.
4759080	4760400	And they didn't have a name.
4760400	4762520	But people loved Dave and the band.
4762520	4765160	And they were like, oh, you're going to see Dave Matthew's
4765160	4769000	band at the tracks?
4769000	4770960	And that's just stuck.
4770960	4772400	It's after him.
4772400	4773800	It's stuck because they didn't have a name.
4773800	4776520	It was like, yeah, Dave Matthews from Miller's.
4776520	4777400	His band is playing.
4777400	4779680	Dave Matthew's band.
4779680	4781600	You don't think that was his plan all along?
4781600	4784240	You don't think the bass player had ever said,
4784240	4786600	maybe we should call it laser eaters.
4786600	4791120	And he was like, no, it doesn't seem that organic to me.
4791120	4791760	He was 16.
4791760	4794720	I like that people keep calling it my name.
4794720	4798800	The bass player was 16, and he dropped out of high school.
4798800	4800160	He can't do that, man.
4800160	4801520	Well, he's a millionaire.
4801520	4805760	Well, does he know about geometry?
4805760	4806260	Probably.
4806260	4808840	Good luck.
4808840	4811600	Good luck, algorithm.
4811600	4812400	Good luck.
4812400	4815640	And before I forget, in case D&D sweeps us away.
4815640	4816880	Wait, I want to say something.
4816880	4817360	Dan?
4817360	4818280	Steve?
4818280	4821720	License and Smarching, a Dave Matthew's band song,
4821720	4824560	for the finale of season five community.
4824560	4829240	And it's probably the best use of the Dave Matthew's band
4829240	4832640	song outside of maybe, I think it's better than Crash
4832640	4834360	Enemy and Lady Bird.
4834360	4837000	But it was an incredibly effective, amazing moment
4837000	4839240	for Greendale Community College.
4839240	4843120	Everybody coming together is a perfect, perfect, perfect drop.
4843120	4846440	Remember doing that episode, Dan?
4846440	4848400	Yeah, a little bit.
4848400	4850960	I have some flashbacks.
4850960	4853680	Yeah.
4853680	4859080	I remember whoever the rep was going, OK,
4859080	4862960	we watched the episode where you guys referenced us.
4862960	4866640	The price has gone up because number one, you need us.
4866640	4870160	Number two, you're making fun of us.
4870160	4873640	So I think that will be $8 a song now.
4873640	4874560	Thank you very much.
4874560	4876880	And we were like, whoo.
4876880	4879280	Well, I always wanted the Ashcrack Bandit
4879280	4885400	to be Dave Matthews after you had Ben Foles in there.
4885400	4888360	I think that's what it canonically was,
4888360	4889120	was Dave Matthews.
4889760	4895200	Do you think, if we title the episode Worst Episode Ever,
4895200	4897240	will it then become the best episode ever?
4897240	4899200	Because people will go like, well, then they called it
4899200	4900400	the worst episode ever.
4900400	4902280	We should title the episode I Feel
4902280	4905280	Like a Bag of Smashed Assholes.
4905280	4906840	How's it going?
4906840	4908720	I was going to go with Cheepee Peepy, but.
4908720	4910000	Cheepee Peepy.
4910000	4911400	Cheepee Peepy.
4911400	4913000	Cheepee Peepy.
4913000	4914200	Cheepee Peepy.
4914200	4915200	Cheepee Peepy.
4915200	4916200	Cheepee Peepy.
4916520	4919640	Cheepee Peepy, oh, you time has come.
4919640	4920680	I write things down.
4920680	4921920	I wrote next to it.
4921920	4923960	I wrote Money is a River, it's frothy.
4923960	4926760	And then right next to it, I'm not a Cheepee Peepy.
4926760	4928520	I'm not.
4928520	4929960	I've never called you.
4929960	4931840	Yeah, Jeff never called you a Cheepee Peepy.
4931840	4933720	No, it was all Dan.
4933720	4935720	Do you think when they were writing Sister Christian,
4935720	4937080	was that warrant?
4937080	4938520	Why do I think Church knows that?
4938520	4939520	You don't know.
4939520	4941360	No, that's a Night Ranger.
4941360	4943120	Night Ranger, Night Ranger.
4944080	4946160	They were like, Sister Christian, time has come.
4946160	4947800	And then they get to the refrain,
4947800	4951120	and then somebody was like, I don't know.
4951120	4953920	You're Motoren.
4953920	4955080	Motoren?
4955080	4956000	What?
4956000	4957920	What's your price for a flight?
4957920	4960440	Yeah, someone was like, what do you mean, Motoren?
4960440	4962640	And he's like, well, what's your price for a flight?
4962640	4964280	I thought this was about nuns.
4964280	4966960	Motoren was a guy that they knew.
4966960	4969080	I can't believe that you thought Warren wrote that,
4969080	4972960	because they're famous for, She's my Cheepee Peepy.
4973920	4974880	They're the worst.
4974880	4976080	I love them, but they're the worst.
4976080	4978160	Well, how about the great thing about the past
4978160	4981320	is it all runs together like a big fucking sad pudding.
4981320	4982840	Hell yeah.
4982840	4984120	There's your title.
4984120	4985480	Thank God.
4985480	4987640	You never hear that NPR thing about the people.
4987640	4988880	Let's call the episode Sad Pudding.
4988880	4990680	You always wish you could remember everything,
4990680	4995000	and then those people that have crazy memory,
4995000	4997120	they can't avoid their memory.
4997120	4999120	Apparently, Mary Lou Hennar is one of them.
4999120	5000920	They're so fucking sad.
5001000	5004200	They hate their lives, because they can never
5004200	5008280	forget how it felt to be a shitty boyfriend
5008280	5011000	or on that fifth relationship in.
5011000	5013280	There's so much shit that you want to forget.
5013280	5017680	Oh, Mary Lou Hennar was such a shitty boyfriend.
5017680	5022240	Every day, she's waking up.
5022240	5024360	That's what PTSD is, I think.
5024360	5026240	Well, the reason she doesn't have a podcast
5026240	5027840	is because two weeks from now, she'd still
5027840	5029560	be remembering this episode, whereas I'm
5029560	5031480	going to be like, I don't know, maybe let's have
5031480	5032680	Dunkin' Trussell back.
5032680	5033520	Fucking awful.
5033520	5034520	Seems like a fun thing.
5034520	5035160	Oh, yeah.
5035160	5038240	You piece of shit.
5038240	5041560	But I'm just saying, we think that because the only time
5041560	5044560	that we realize that we can't remember stuff, we feel weak.
5044560	5046200	It's like not being able to lift something.
5046200	5048120	So we go, I wish I could lift everything.
5048120	5050360	But there are people who can lift everything memory-wise.
5050360	5053600	And it's kind of a bummer for them.
5053600	5055560	I'm re-looking to my spell list, Spencer.
5055560	5057960	And I didn't realize that I have reduced animal.
5057960	5063040	And it says, shrinks down one all-caps-willing animal.
5063040	5064960	Yeah.
5064960	5066960	How do I know that there's consent from an animal
5066960	5068480	to shrink that animal down?
5068480	5070160	Oh, if you have to ask.
5070160	5071200	I mean, come on.
5071200	5072560	Fair enough.
5072560	5073560	Fair enough.
5073560	5075080	No, I mean, you're a druid.
5075080	5077800	You can get a sense of animals.
5077800	5080680	Well, yeah, because what if it's one of my nature's allies?
5080680	5083240	Yeah, he'd probably love to be reduced.
5083240	5084960	Yeah.
5084960	5086200	Let's do it.
5086240	5089400	Well, there's no rush, really.
5089400	5091080	I have another question as well.
5091080	5092560	Wasn't I almost dead?
5092560	5093040	Yeah.
5093040	5094040	That's all I remember.
5094040	5094760	Yeah.
5094760	5097480	I never really, I think I was down to two hit points.
5097480	5098160	Do you need some healings?
5098160	5098800	I think you were.
5098800	5102840	As we crawled out the window of that pub.
5102840	5103520	And then.
5103520	5105000	Are we at my house?
5105000	5105600	Yeah.
5105600	5108440	And then we dragged, what was his name?
5108440	5109360	The guy.
5109360	5110080	Shrove.
5110080	5112400	Shrove to.
5112400	5114120	There was a guy, Shambling Gary.
5114120	5115120	Shambling Gary Shrove.
5115640	5117680	Shambling Gary Shambling back into us.
5117680	5119440	It took us through a crack in the wall.
5119440	5121000	Yeah, to a crack in the wall.
5121000	5121960	Took us to a place.
5121960	5124880	OK, is that I guess you could take it from there.
5124880	5126280	That's what I remember.
5126280	5127280	Yeah.
5127280	5130080	All right, Spencer, you want to let her rip?
5130080	5131320	Or do we already just do it?
5131320	5133880	Do you want to give us a proper caption?
5133880	5134600	I'll do it.
5134600	5135920	Not caption, but recap, brother.
5139800	5143880	Last time on Harmon Time.
5143880	5150240	Our heroes went to Dor Nester on the quest for Patchen's Gem.
5150240	5152480	They were searching for information.
5152480	5155200	And they went to the Church of the Body Temple,
5155200	5158280	and then another church to look for clues.
5158280	5162080	And acting upon those clues, they went to the theater,
5162080	5167120	where they heard the name of one person, Shrove.
5167120	5169920	So they went in search of that person.
5169920	5173160	And they caught him out with his pants down.
5173240	5177320	Literally, because he was in the bathroom.
5177320	5181600	They burst in in the bathroom, causing a scene immediately.
5181600	5184480	And a near riot as enemy combatants
5184480	5188200	flooded into the magically darkened bathroom
5188200	5192760	until our heroes beat a hasty retreat with their quarry
5192760	5194480	in tow.
5194480	5197680	Trying to extricate themselves from the mob,
5197680	5199240	they didn't try hard enough.
5199240	5201720	And the mob was on their heels.
5201720	5206120	But then Chad shot fire and started a fire.
5206120	5211240	And then Carlos used his solar flare
5211240	5214840	to cover their escape, which was also
5214840	5220800	aided by the random addition of a shambling mound.
5220800	5225160	Together, they traveled to a pig farm
5225160	5231480	and hiding behind a broken collection of bits of wall.
5231480	5238280	They hunkered down with their still unruly, unwilling,
5238280	5242720	hostage Shrove.
5242720	5245160	What would happen?
5245160	5247080	I don't know.
5247080	5249560	Find out today.
5253960	5254960	Whoa.
5254960	5258600	So I'm making some green tea.
5258600	5259880	If you guys want anything.
5259880	5261080	Thanks, Gary Shambling.
5261880	5262800	Put the kettle on.
5262800	5267160	Four cups?
5267160	5267680	Four cups?
5267680	5268880	I would adore a cup of tea.
5268880	5269380	Thank you.
5269380	5271720	You got one cup?
5271720	5272320	Two?
5272320	5272840	Two?
5272840	5274920	Can we make it an even three?
5274920	5275880	I'm kidding.
5275880	5276920	All right.
5276920	5278720	All right, here we go.
5278720	5282280	Let's get back to interrogating this guy.
5282280	5285400	Spencer, what state is Shrove?
5285400	5286440	What do we have?
5286440	5288040	What happened?
5288040	5289720	Is he locked up?
5290720	5292720	I don't think he's locked up.
5292720	5298200	I think Dan has had him kind of grappled to some extent.
5298200	5300240	I want to feel like I remember.
5300240	5304160	And if it's only in my head, I want to secure him.
5304160	5308560	I want to ligature him.
5308560	5309720	What?
5309720	5311320	I want to tie him up.
5311320	5312880	Do you own rope?
5312880	5314160	You could have mine.
5314160	5316360	Thanks.
5316360	5319400	Are you good at tying with this?
5319400	5321240	As good as anybody else.
5321240	5323000	Well, probably better than me.
5323000	5324960	I haven't spent 10 years in a library.
5324960	5329480	So while Carlos is holding him, I tie him up with my rope.
5329480	5331920	All right, you do that.
5331920	5333800	Hell yeah.
5333800	5335960	All right, Shrove.
5335960	5340080	We are in the quest for Patchen's gem.
5340080	5342520	I know you don't know it as Patchen's gem.
5342520	5345160	You probably just know it as a gem.
5345160	5348120	We've got to go over this one more time.
5348120	5351000	And make no mistake about it, there's only one way
5351000	5352120	you're living through this.
5352120	5356400	And that's if we get anything valuable from you at all.
5356400	5359560	So you've got to make shit up.
5359560	5361160	If we've gone down the wrong road,
5361160	5363680	you've got to just make shit up.
5363680	5365600	And you've got to convince all of us.
5365600	5367520	And believe me, that's a lot of sense motive.
5367520	5372600	Uh, that's a lot of motive sensing.
5372600	5374880	Gary, Gary, I think your tea is on.
5374880	5377760	Oh, thank you very much.
5378640	5382440	So here we go from the top.
5382440	5384800	Where'd you get that robe, that bloody robe?
5384800	5386760	It was in the theater.
5386760	5393440	It was in the prop box where new costumes and stuff are put.
5393440	5396200	In your opinion, why would that make its way
5396200	5397760	into the prop box at a theater?
5400760	5402920	Hey, you want lemon?
5402920	5403680	You want lemon?
5403680	5404560	I'd love lemon.
5404560	5405120	You'd love it?
5405120	5405880	OK.
5405920	5406840	Oh, another.
5406840	5408800	OK, here you go.
5408800	5411040	I was raising my hand.
5411040	5413480	If you're having one, get five cups.
5413480	5414320	Yeah, yeah.
5414320	5415800	OK, thanks.
5415800	5417120	Maybe someone didn't want it.
5417120	5420320	They were like, I don't want this.
5420320	5422360	And then they didn't know what to do with it.
5422360	5425440	Who puts the new props in the prop box?
5425440	5426400	Well, just people.
5426400	5429400	It's kind of like what people?
5429400	5430880	Theater people.
5430880	5434000	Yeah, but there's not like distinguished positions?
5434000	5435240	No, it's like a donation.
5436080	5436960	Yeah.
5436960	5440040	So let me just walk through this a day
5440040	5442920	in the life of a bloody robe.
5442920	5443920	I have a bloody robe.
5443920	5447520	I drop it off on the stoop of the theater.
5447520	5452240	Margaret grabs it, drops it in a box full of a mixture
5452240	5456280	of clean, half clean, and blood encrusted clothes
5456280	5459480	that people drop off on the stoop end of that box.
5459480	5461400	Some of the actors pull it out, use it
5461400	5463920	as a scene in a theater performance.
5463920	5465440	Some others pull it out and wash it
5465440	5466920	so it can be used as a scene.
5466920	5469320	And then there's guys like you, prominent figures
5469320	5471360	in the theater, who decide to wear it
5471360	5473600	and then sell it to a homeless guy.
5473600	5475920	Yeah, no, I gave it to a homeless guy
5475920	5479560	who's notoriously naked in this town.
5479560	5480440	I wasn't wearing it.
5480440	5483880	I'm going to make some bread if you guys hungry for bread.
5483880	5486720	Shrove, do you like bread?
5486720	5487360	No.
5487360	5487880	No bread?
5487880	5489000	It's OK.
5489000	5491000	OK, well, I'm putting it on.
5491000	5492800	Pumpernickel?
5492800	5494320	Yeah, it is.
5494320	5495360	All right, OK, cool.
5495360	5496200	All right.
5496200	5499160	This guy's excited.
5499160	5503520	I'm going to take a sidebar with my friends.
5503520	5504040	OK.
5507920	5510560	Guys, I don't know what I'm doing.
5510560	5512400	And I think I did it.
5512400	5513920	Do you want me to talk to him?
5513920	5516640	No, Gary, thank you.
5516640	5517560	No.
5517560	5521400	Thank Gary, can you give us a moment?
5521480	5524120	Oh, you said we needed to talk.
5524120	5527360	My friends and I. I'm so appreciative of you.
5527360	5533240	Well, so I'm not a friend?
5533240	5534040	No, it's not that.
5534040	5536440	I gave you bread.
5536440	5538440	You already made it?
5538440	5539800	I gave him bread.
5539800	5540600	I gave you bread.
5540600	5541360	This is my home.
5541360	5543040	Gary, he means more like work friends.
5543040	5544040	This is a work.
5544040	5545480	This is like a work.
5545480	5546280	This is my home.
5546280	5547400	This is a work issue thing.
5547400	5550680	We have work conversations to talk about.
5550680	5551600	This is my home.
5551600	5553080	OK, Gary, Gary, you're in.
5553080	5553560	You're in.
5553560	5554360	You're in.
5554360	5555240	Come talk to us.
5555240	5555760	OK.
5555760	5556520	We love you, Gary.
5556520	5557080	Shambling.
5557080	5558600	Thank you.
5558600	5560120	But away from Shrove.
5560120	5561560	I need to have a sidebar.
5561560	5563000	Should I pull the curtain?
5563000	5568360	Hey, Gary, what do you know about these townsfolk?
5568360	5569200	What do I know?
5569200	5570640	Yeah.
5570640	5579120	You know, they're OK when they don't really like my kind,
5579120	5580640	the bread that I make.
5580640	5583000	Carlos, what was the importance of the bloody robe?
5583000	5584800	Because that was the robe that maybe was being
5584800	5586720	worn by one of the butchered.
5586720	5587600	It was Patchen's robe.
5587600	5589040	He didn't think I remember.
5589040	5590840	I don't remember.
5590840	5592840	It was Patchen's robe, and they stripped it off.
5592840	5595160	Oh, when they fucked up Patchen's and they took his robe,
5595160	5596560	and then someone just took it back.
5596560	5601160	So yeah, that just might be a collection box for the theater.
5601160	5603320	All right, well, it's an inconvenient time
5603320	5604600	for us to realize this.
5604600	5606760	Sorry, I got to get the bread.
5606760	5610440	I thought you had a hot lead.
5610440	5611840	I didn't know what was going on.
5611840	5616640	I thought I did too, and at the time, not to be defensive,
5616640	5618320	but it seemed like everyone agreed.
5618320	5620200	I walk back out to where Shrove is,
5620200	5622120	and then I sit down with my tea, and I say,
5622120	5624760	Shrove, look, we're sorry to put you through the wringer
5624760	5625240	on this one.
5625240	5627600	If somebody was collecting any valuable gems,
5627600	5629880	where might a gem be taken in this town?
5629880	5634440	Is there a place where that might be fenced or taken to,
5634440	5637880	like, sold in the black market or something like that?
5637880	5641080	If someone stole a gem, they probably stole it
5641080	5642600	for some reason.
5642600	5645840	Like, they had some plan of what to do with it.
5645840	5648760	Have you heard any word in the street about stolen gems?
5648760	5650120	No, I haven't.
5650120	5653000	I'm afraid I don't listen for that sort of stuff.
5653000	5655400	Do you know anybody that we might be able to talk to that
5655400	5657600	might know the scoop on that?
5657600	5658600	I don't know, man.
5658600	5660200	I don't know what you're talking about.
5660200	5663760	Shrove, who does the most donating of props?
5663760	5666040	Just the, you know, the day players.
5666040	5667120	All right, strip them naked.
5667120	5670040	Strip them naked.
5670040	5672840	We're going to let you go when I'm looking at every fucking
5672840	5673320	hole.
5673320	5677800	I start taking off Shrove's upper garments.
5677800	5679160	The bread is finished.
5679160	5679680	Thank you.
5679680	5680920	We'll be right with you.
5680920	5681920	I don't feel good about this.
5681920	5683400	Thank you, Gary.
5683400	5684600	We're stripping your friend naked.
5684600	5686320	Even if you have to bunch up your clothes around your waist
5686320	5688320	because you're hog tied or whatever, you know, like,
5688320	5689360	I don't know, it's just.
5689360	5691640	Oh, oh, ah.
5691640	5692520	It's a search.
5692520	5693520	It's a search.
5693520	5694600	It's a search?
5694600	5696480	You're a shambling mound.
5696480	5697240	All of a sudden, you're.
5697240	5698920	Well, I know what a dick looks like.
5698920	5700720	You're going to high hat us all of a sudden?
5700720	5701600	High hat?
5701600	5702120	The man.
5702120	5703960	You're going to get the high hat.
5703960	5705640	What are you guys doing?
5705640	5707840	You didn't meet us at a polo match.
5707840	5710880	We were dragging a bloody naked man down the street.
5710880	5713560	Let us finish our business.
5713560	5714640	Stop being a dick.
5714640	5715640	Stop high-roading us.
5715640	5716880	OK, well, fine.
5716880	5718320	At least use a coaster.
5718320	5721520	What is this?
5721520	5722240	God damn it.
5722240	5723000	I start vigorous.
5723960	5726320	Vigorously patting down Shrove looking for anything
5726320	5729640	on his on his body or look at his fucking butt.
5729640	5730640	Look at it.
5730640	5731560	Let's start.
5731560	5732840	I'm going to start with the clothes.
5732840	5735760	Let's cross the bridge when we get to it.
5735760	5740120	You you remove his clothes and his his stuff.
5740120	5743080	You find he's he's under his clothes.
5743080	5745400	He's got a big tattoo on his back.
5745400	5750560	It looks like a crazy intricate like kind of like a Celtic
5750560	5755680	tattoo like with symbols and kind of like glyphs and stuff.
5755680	5758440	But it kind of forms the crude shape of a dragon.
5758440	5758960	Here we go.
5758960	5760040	Here we go.
5760040	5763440	And also in his clothes, he has a bag
5763440	5769200	of holding full of beef jerky and a sack of some money
5769200	5770640	and a harp.
5770640	5773160	I take that bag of holding.
5773160	5773680	All right.
5773680	5775560	Wait, are you a harvest?
5775560	5777200	Are you a bard?
5777200	5779480	I know I'm even I'm a doctor.
5779480	5782560	I play music, but you play the kind of music
5782560	5784480	that raises the dead.
5784480	5786640	No, you don't raise the dead with music.
5786640	5788000	I guess people could.
5788000	5790640	I'm a druid and I'm not trained in the bardic art so much,
5790640	5792400	but I appreciate a nice harp tune.
5795600	5797680	First of all, what is the meaning of this dragon
5797680	5799200	tattoo on your back?
5799200	5801640	Oh, it's just a birthmark.
5801640	5802920	It's just a birthmark.
5802920	5806280	Yeah, you just happen to have a birthmark of a dragon
5806280	5806840	on your back.
5806840	5808560	Some people do.
5808560	5811480	I've seen that symbol before.
5811480	5814360	Tell us more, Gary Shambling.
5814360	5816480	I saw it in a book.
5816480	5817600	Saw it in a book.
5817600	5819720	Let's see here.
5819720	5826200	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, dictionary.
5826200	5829880	He finds a book labeled the 13 dragon marked houses.
5829880	5830640	Here we go.
5830640	5831760	Here we go.
5831760	5835680	A, B, C, D, right here.
5835680	5837400	Take a look at that.
5837440	5839480	Whoa.
5839480	5842920	The relevant lore is that the members of the dragon marked
5842920	5846160	houses sometimes manifest dragon marks or birth marks
5846160	5850280	in the shape of dragons that they bestow magical affinity,
5850280	5853920	but they're like a bloodline sort of thing.
5853920	5856040	So they indicate a bloodline in these dragon
5856040	5857960	marked houses which run the guilds.
5857960	5860320	So is he druidic too?
5860320	5861320	Maybe he could read or talk.
5861320	5862520	That's not what his birthmarks is.
5862520	5864360	You don't know if he's druidic.
5864360	5866520	So you're dragon marked?
5866520	5869320	Nope.
5869320	5871000	You're lying.
5871000	5872160	Yeah, no, I'm lying.
5872160	5876080	Do you speak the language of the guilds?
5876080	5878840	Yeah, well, it's like a code, but yeah.
5878840	5879680	Should we show them?
5879680	5881960	Yeah, let's show them the letter that we found
5881960	5884000	on top of the banditos.
5884000	5888960	Look, if you could read this for us, we'll give you.
5888960	5890880	We got him tied up and he's naked.
5890880	5892000	Read it for us.
5892000	5892960	All right.
5892960	5896920	It says, the young one on the road outside of Rhone
5896920	5897920	holds the purse.
5897920	5899440	Top priority is the purse.
5899440	5902520	Next top priority is kill them all.
5902520	5906480	Drop point north, 4 AM, Oloroon 9.
5906480	5909800	Oloroon 9's a date.
5909800	5911360	Someone write that shit down.
5911360	5912640	He'll send real life out.
5912640	5913640	Somebody writes it down.
5913640	5916360	I've got a photographic memory.
5916360	5918240	Say it back for us, Shambles.
5918240	5920040	Just give me.
5920040	5920840	I don't want to.
5920840	5923800	You said the young one outside the road on Rhone
5923800	5926120	is the top priority?
5926120	5928720	The young one on the road outside the Rhone
5928720	5929520	holds the purse.
5929520	5933080	Now, just for your memories, Rhone's the starting village.
5933080	5934320	Right.
5934320	5935200	This is the assignment.
5935200	5936360	That's why they attacked us.
5936360	5938000	The young one is Patcheons.
5938000	5939920	So we have a document that told us
5939920	5942200	that the thing was going to happen that already happened?
5942200	5943120	Yeah.
5943120	5945840	What you find in a hit man when they attack you,
5945840	5947480	you find the note that says go attack them.
5947480	5948600	All right, keep going.
5948600	5950080	Top priority is the purse.
5950080	5952080	Next top priority is kill them all.
5952080	5952880	Got it.
5952880	5955440	Drop point north, like a location.
5955440	5959000	Drop point north.
5959000	5960520	And oh, you just take it.
5960520	5964280	4 AM, Oloroon 9, which is like a date and time.
5964280	5967200	And has that date and time come yet?
5967200	5971400	It's that day and not that time.
5971400	5973200	How far away is it from now?
5973200	5975200	It's soon.
5975200	5977400	Shrove, where is drop point north?
5981080	5983080	I'm not telling you guys.
5983080	5984840	Wait, Shrove said that?
5984840	5985840	Yeah.
5985840	5989240	What would it take for us to get you to tell us?
5989240	5991280	We got some nice bread.
5991280	5992600	I'm not telling you guys.
5992600	5994160	We'll invest in your theater.
5994160	5995080	You'll invest?
5995080	5997240	Oh, you guys don't have money.
5997240	5999960	By any chance, does your order have anything
5999960	6003480	to do with integrity, honor, that kind of thing?
6003480	6005320	Yeah, secrecy.
6005320	6012040	Yeah, so in other words, if you were to betray your order,
6012040	6013600	you'd be a bad guy, right?
6013600	6014880	Generally, yeah, yeah.
6014880	6019240	So you'd rather get your throat slit protecting your order,
6019240	6021520	right?
6021520	6023000	No.
6023000	6024720	Are you lying?
6024720	6025240	No.
6025240	6026400	But you wouldn't lie, right?
6026400	6027840	Because you have integrity, right?
6027840	6030160	You're not a common bunch of thugs.
6030240	6039480	You're genetically born like you're dragon born.
6039480	6042320	Not to, oh, I'm sorry.
6042320	6044280	That's copyright.
6044280	6047480	You're dragon something.
6047480	6048040	Marked.
6048040	6050400	Marked.
6050400	6051480	Let me ask you this.
6051480	6057920	If it came to a choice between lying about flipping loyalties
6057920	6062080	because some of your brethren had gone very bad
6062080	6066240	and protecting your bad brethren and paying for them
6066240	6068520	with your life, what would be the more honorable dragon
6068520	6070080	marked thing to do?
6070080	6071840	Neither.
6071840	6072800	Well, what do you want?
6072800	6076640	I just want to hang out, just live my life.
6076640	6079520	You want to hang out and not tell us who these guys are,
6079520	6080200	like where they are?
6080200	6081520	I don't know who these guys are, man.
6081520	6083080	These guys are terrible killers who
6083080	6085400	attacked an innocent young man whose only job
6085400	6087880	was to protect this gem.
6087920	6091280	You're not on the right side of history here.
6091280	6093320	I'm sorry, but that's why you've.
6093320	6096360	I have two gold pieces.
6096360	6098440	Whoa.
6098440	6101920	That changes everything.
6101920	6104360	Did two gold pieces sweeten the pot, Trove?
6104360	6107520	No, I had three gold pieces before you robbed me.
6107520	6108880	Well, now you'll have five.
6108880	6112080	You've done nothing but pretend to be someone else.
6112080	6113680	Aren't you tired of living a lie?
6113680	6115600	I belong to the Church of the Silver Flame.
6115600	6118440	I'm just trying to redeem this countryside.
6118440	6121600	I'm trying to do something right for the purifying flame
6121600	6123120	before I die.
6123120	6125440	We ran across this lad.
6125440	6126600	He had a gem.
6126600	6128000	He was supposed to protect it.
6128000	6129480	We were assassinated.
6129480	6132600	We were waylaid by horrible backstabbing, dishonest
6132600	6133680	bandits.
6133680	6137960	Do you ally with them or the rest of the world?
6137960	6138600	Yeah, kind of.
6138600	6141440	That's our whole town where a bunch of ruffians and thieves
6141440	6142680	and brigands and stuff.
6142680	6145320	It's not great, but that's what we got, man.
6145320	6146880	I use Intimidate.
6146880	6148600	Where is it?
6148600	6150520	What's your Intimidate score?
6150520	6151960	It doesn't list one.
6151960	6152560	Really?
6152560	6155240	Yeah, it has a check, but no thing.
6155240	6156960	All right, what's your charisma then?
6160440	6164440	7 minus 2.
6164440	6165960	Oh, boy.
6165960	6168960	You don't, you're not convincing.
6168960	6170040	Well, I mean.
6170040	6172200	I turn to the side.
6172200	6173800	Is it well lit?
6173800	6174360	Is it dark?
6174360	6175200	Where are we at?
6175320	6176000	It's dark.
6176000	6177320	It's dark and muddy.
6177320	6179120	It's dark and muddy in a pig farm.
6179120	6185440	I start to go, rrrr, rrrr, and I open my mouth,
6185440	6186800	but he can't see.
6186800	6189440	I put my hand up to cast Firebolt.
6189440	6192400	I make it look like it's coming out of my mouth like a dragon.
6192400	6194560	I go, dragon fire!
6194560	6197040	And I cast Firebolt to make it look like it's coming out
6197040	6201080	of my mouth, to impress him with his dragon mark guild thingy.
6201080	6202840	It looks like it's coming out of your mouth.
6202840	6203720	Yeah.
6203720	6208880	And I go, hey, I'll dragon your shit through the mud.
6208880	6210480	Magic exists.
6210480	6211400	Magic exists.
6211400	6213160	Yeah.
6213160	6216840	I thought you'd like that because I'm Draconic as well.
6216840	6219800	Draconic, whatever you like.
6219800	6221000	I don't like that.
6221000	6223920	I take Gary Shambling aside.
6223920	6225520	OK.
6225520	6227040	Shrove, you've done enough.
6227040	6229240	We just had to make sure we knew everything you knew.
6229240	6231320	We're just going to relax and have some tea.
6231320	6231800	OK.
6231800	6232680	Gary Shambling.
6232840	6233800	Yeah.
6233800	6234880	You want me to talk to him?
6234880	6237400	Do you want to give our friend Shrove some tea?
6237400	6246240	And do you have anything that'll help him to smooth the plow?
6246240	6247600	Well, do you have anything that'll
6247600	6250640	help him tell the truth and or do you have anything
6250640	6254000	that'll just kill him?
6254000	6258400	I've got some vinegar and some solvents.
6258400	6259040	All right.
6259040	6261040	And we can light some candles.
6261040	6265200	OK, I thought maybe Shambling Mounds were more plugged in.
6265200	6266040	You thought what?
6266040	6266880	I don't know.
6266880	6267640	It's fine.
6267640	6269280	Do you think I have a gun?
6269280	6271600	Diarrhea, hey, come here for a second.
6271600	6272680	Yeah.
6272680	6274840	Do you have poison?
6274840	6277320	Let me see.
6277320	6279800	I might have some laxatives.
6279800	6283480	We could mix it with my vinegar.
6283480	6285360	All right, let's just kill this fucking guy.
6285360	6287400	Why you got none of my living room?
6287400	6288400	Let's just kill him.
6288400	6290120	Why are we killing him?
6290120	6292120	Is he because he was ineffectual or?
6292120	6293440	He can live with me.
6293440	6296160	Well, if he's left alive, he's going to go,
6296160	6297320	he's counter to our mission.
6297320	6299520	He's going to go warn the rest of his brethren.
6299520	6301520	There's only one reason he has to not tell us
6301520	6303320	the drop point in this note, and that's
6303320	6304880	because he doesn't side with us.
6304880	6306280	He sides with these people that we lead.
6306280	6308160	OK, let me suggest something.
6308160	6309760	We can't leave him alive.
6309760	6312840	Why don't you just leave him here tied up until after the drop
6312840	6314920	point, time, and date?
6314920	6316720	I don't want to offend you, Gary Shambling,
6316720	6320040	but I question your ability to maintain a hostage situation.
6320040	6322040	I don't know if that's what you're cut out for.
6322040	6324640	You're Shambling, and you're a mound.
6324640	6327240	Racist.
6327240	6329040	I have a rust monster.
6329040	6332040	I mean, we've got a lot of work to do in a short amount of time,
6332040	6334680	and I think we should just step on his head until he's dead.
6334680	6336480	He's been a terrible pain in the ass.
6336480	6337920	He's withheld information from us.
6337920	6339720	You're a terrible pain in the ass.
6339720	6343480	I was just taking a shit.
6343480	6348240	Listen, you had your chance to assess things and judge people.
6348240	6349400	You've been bettered.
6349400	6351240	And now you're about to die.
6351240	6352240	That's how it is.
6352240	6354080	You have to listen to us talk about it.
6354080	6355800	You know, you guys are nice.
6355800	6356680	I think you're cool.
6356680	6359760	You drank my tea, and you had some bread.
6359760	6361000	Made a little bit of a mess.
6361000	6362120	I guess I'll clean it up.
6362120	6366120	But you can't kill him in my living room.
6366120	6367720	You can't kill him in my living room.
6367720	6369000	I don't want a haunted living room.
6369000	6369960	Where's your kitchen?
6369960	6372800	I summon nature's ally.
6372800	6375280	Summon Squid.
6375280	6377000	Thank you.
6377000	6377560	Thank you.
6377560	6379360	Do I have any more spells after this one, or no?
6379960	6382640	Haven't you summoned the nature's ally already?
6382640	6383800	You put the bear.
6383800	6386160	I don't think you have two, do you?
6386160	6387080	Maybe you do.
6387080	6389920	I was going to take a giant squid, shrink it down,
6389920	6391960	because I can shrink down animals.
6391960	6394240	I was going to put it in his mouth or up his butt.
6394240	6397160	And that was going to be like the worst wrath of Khan
6397160	6398400	to put the bug on the guys here.
6398400	6400080	Let me make a suggestion.
6403080	6406480	Would you consider a shambling mound an animal?
6406560	6410880	A shambling mound is like an elemental or something.
6410880	6411720	Exactly.
6411720	6412800	Shrink me down.
6412800	6415280	No, no, it doesn't count as an animal in that sense.
6415280	6416960	You said an-a-mental, Adam.
6416960	6418960	All right.
6418960	6419920	Let me try this.
6419920	6420920	Let me just try this.
6420920	6422120	Can I try something?
6422120	6424800	I thought the squid up the butt thing was pretty fucking cold.
6424800	6425600	I don't want a dick.
6425600	6427560	I take my morning star, and I just
6427560	6428960	start hating it in the head.
6428960	6431520	No, you can't kill him in my living room.
6431520	6434160	Take him outside with the pigs.
6434760	6438040	I don't want a haunted theater person in my living room.
6438040	6441280	I have people over.
6441280	6443480	This is where I work.
6443480	6445720	I work out of my home.
6445720	6448200	My roommate's about to come home.
6448200	6449080	Who's your roommate?
6449080	6451840	My rust monster.
6451840	6452880	You have a rust monster?
6452880	6455840	I have a rust monster.
6455840	6457240	It's part of my character that I'm
6457240	6459160	unable to control myself at this point,
6459160	6462520	because I've got a lot of toxic shame in me.
6463520	6465600	I feel undermined by my own church.
6465600	6468040	Why don't you take some of your toxic energy
6468040	6471240	and clean up after yourself?
6471240	6472640	Plus one.
6472640	6473440	All right.
6473440	6475280	You hit him for three damage.
6475280	6477840	He leaps up and tries to dodge out of the way.
6477840	6481120	And as he does so, you realize that the ropes were tied
6481120	6485320	really loosely, and he was kind of, he wasn't entirely bound.
6485320	6488120	So he kind of gets out of, he wriggles free of the rope,
6488120	6491280	but in doing so is wanged in the head by you for three damage.
6491280	6492680	Aha, you passed the test.
6492680	6495920	You passed the test.
6495920	6501640	I open the window, and I try to go get out like a bird trapped
6501640	6502520	in the house.
6502520	6503720	Get out.
6503720	6504880	Get out of here.
6504880	6506120	To him?
6506120	6506600	Yeah.
6506600	6508120	Carlos, what was the test that he passed?
6508120	6508920	Getting hit and taken?
6508920	6509760	That was nothing.
6509760	6510240	Get him.
6510240	6510720	Get him.
6510720	6511360	Get him.
6511360	6512600	Get out quick.
6512600	6515360	I start whacking him in with my quarter staff.
6515360	6517000	All right.
6517000	6521200	Like non-leastily, but just trying to bruise him
6521200	6521920	up some.
6521920	6524280	All right, you hit him, but not substantially.
6524280	6527280	He doesn't take any damage.
6527280	6528720	Get out.
6528720	6529280	Get out.
6529280	6532480	You still don't want to tell us where the drop point north is?
6532480	6534640	You guys are the worst.
6534640	6535800	We know that.
6535800	6536880	We know that.
6536880	6537960	We know that.
6537960	6539560	We're hanging around at a pig farm
6539560	6541480	with a shambling mound with a guy that probably
6541480	6542760	has nothing to do with this.
6542760	6543880	Yeah, we are the worst.
6543880	6546400	Watch us try to keep you alive.
6546400	6548880	Go run out the window.
6548880	6551160	I feel really bad about what's transpiring here.
6551600	6552560	Talk about it later.
6552560	6555280	I have a really great play about horses.
6555280	6556680	Will that intrigue you?
6556680	6559640	Will you please attack him?
6559640	6563520	I start whipping gold pieces at him.
6563520	6564760	What?
6564760	6565960	How many?
6565960	6566760	Three.
6566760	6569120	But really hard, like at his head.
6569120	6571040	Because I feel bad, but I also don't
6571040	6574200	want to disrespect my elder.
6574200	6575480	All right, you miss.
6575480	6577280	It breaks the window.
6577280	6579280	Oh.
6579280	6580120	What the fuck?
6580200	6581160	Oh, fuck.
6581160	6582320	That's all you guys, right?
6582320	6585640	All right, he climbs up the window.
6585640	6586160	All right.
6586160	6586840	Thank you.
6586840	6587360	Thank you.
6587360	6588240	I'm sorry.
6588240	6592400	Broke the window, water rings, bread crumbs.
6592400	6594680	We have to go find drop point north, right?
6594680	6595960	Isn't that the thing?
6595960	6598360	Alternate pitch.
6598360	6600680	We abandon the quest for Patchen's Gem.
6600680	6603880	Well, yeah, I mean, you guys do remember that crazy lady that
6603880	6605560	burnt down the church originally.
6605560	6608040	It was that whole other thing.
6608040	6609320	What happened to that lady?
6609320	6611400	There's the gargoyle that Patchen's has been telling us
6611400	6612280	from the beginning.
6612280	6613160	Don't help me.
6613160	6616080	I don't want it.
6616080	6618400	Wait a minute.
6618400	6620920	I have an idea.
6620920	6621600	What was that?
6621600	6624080	One thing.
6624080	6626920	I had no use for it, but maybe you guys could.
6626920	6629440	I found this map.
6629440	6630760	I take the map.
6630760	6633240	It's an old map.
6633240	6635800	It has like ripped edges.
6635800	6637040	No, not ripped edges.
6637040	6639120	Like burnt edges like it's from the past.
6639760	6641400	Yes, it's written in English.
6641400	6644840	I can only speak shambling.
6644840	6646400	It's in guild speak again.
6646400	6650040	Yeah, I don't know what you're rambling languages.
6650040	6651040	You can't just read it.
6651040	6652560	Gary Shamley, can you read guild speak?
6652560	6655680	No, I only can read shambling.
6655680	6657800	That's why I'm giving it to you.
6657800	6661720	It's pretty clear to me that we have fucked up in this town.
6661720	6664360	We have never done anything right in any town.
6664360	6668040	But shouldn't we what?
6668040	6669960	Shouldn't we just stake out the props box
6669960	6671360	and see who's dropping and stuff?
6671360	6674440	Are you out of your goddamn mind, child?
6674440	6677400	I tell you, we have fucked up in this town.
6677400	6678800	Everyone knows what we look like.
6678800	6681320	We've attacked a popular man, so dragged him
6681320	6683360	to a shambling man's hut.
6683360	6685360	We failed to interrogate him.
6685360	6686880	Just walk me back through it.
6686880	6689880	Where do we go back to to start getting back on track?
6689880	6692160	I think we just wander the fuck out of here.
6692160	6693080	We fucked up.
6693080	6694400	We can't do anything in this town.
6694400	6695120	Where is Patchen?
6695120	6695520	Isn't he here?
6695520	6696680	Whatever happened to the music?
6696800	6698560	You don't know where Patchen's is.
6698560	6700120	Patchen's is long gone.
6700120	6701160	Patchen's is sick of us.
6701160	6702720	So we're going to go back to Rowan with our tail
6702720	6703560	between our legs.
6703560	6704880	No gem, no nothing.
6704880	6706680	And we don't even know what we've done.
6706680	6707960	Alternate pitch.
6707960	6709280	Alternate pitch.
6709280	6711280	When the silver flame speaks to you,
6711280	6712800	it speaks through burning.
6712800	6717160	Destruction is one man's construction.
6717160	6721240	The silver flame burns from the center of the earth outward.
6721240	6726360	It creates infernos wherever you have constructed
6726360	6728280	false realities.
6728280	6731360	Perhaps we have spent this campaign learning
6731360	6734560	that we need to wander the realm.
6734560	6736880	While he's talking, I close my eyes.
6736880	6739560	But I, using my little eye mark on my forehead
6739560	6742280	that I never use, I can still see him.
6742280	6744760	This is a new opportunity for us.
6744760	6746240	We can't go back to work.
6746240	6747840	We fucked up.
6747840	6749040	We can't even freelance.
6749040	6750360	We fucked up.
6750360	6751880	We could wander.
6751880	6754440	And we could do good for the church.
6754440	6756600	Freelance.
6756600	6760280	Almost as if we'd have to walk into maybe new dungeons
6760280	6764280	that we didn't fuck up and forget where we were going.
6764280	6765160	We get on the road.
6765160	6765760	Get on the road.
6765760	6766960	We never look back.
6766960	6767720	Who's Patchen?
6767720	6768320	Pedal to the moon.
6768320	6768960	Where's his gem?
6768960	6769560	Fuck Patchen.
6769560	6770040	Who cares?
6770040	6773840	Hey, look, maybe down the road, maybe we meet Patchen's
6773840	6774520	and find a gem.
6774520	6775840	But that's not our fucking thing.
6775840	6778640	For all we know, but we're going to do something so cool.
6778640	6781520	Give me one second.
6781520	6783480	Patchen's is going to end up being wherever he is.
6783800	6785320	Oh my god, I got my gem back.
6785320	6787320	I have a feeling that's what we're destined for.
6787320	6789080	Bigger things, bigger things.
6789080	6789880	We fucked up.
6789880	6792080	Well, I can cancel a couple of meetings
6792080	6795560	that I have this afternoon and pack a bag.
6795560	6796240	You know, fuck it.
6796240	6797160	Let's do it.
6797160	6798440	Let's do it.
6798440	6798960	Let's do it.
6798960	6800080	You know, let's do it.
6800080	6801000	I got a broken window.
6801000	6802360	Winter's coming.
6802360	6804280	I'll be back in a second here.
6804280	6806040	Hey, pack up some of that pumpernickel
6806040	6808280	and then maybe a flask of that tea.
6808280	6811000	I say, you know what, I've never been more excited in my life.
6811000	6811480	Yeah.
6811480	6813440	I've never felt more positive.
6813440	6814160	This is great.
6814160	6816600	You know, I think we're going to look back on today and go,
6816600	6819440	that was the beginning of us doing this.
6819440	6822360	Yeah, the adventure is not about someone else's gem.
6822360	6824480	This is about our own adventure.
6824480	6825280	Yes.
6825280	6826720	Yeah, doing things right.
6826720	6827200	Yes.
6827200	6829320	It's not about knowing things and keeping track of things.
6829320	6835640	The greatest adventure in the world lies ahead.
6835640	6836440	All right.
6836440	6837240	Hats.
6837240	6838120	Hats on.
6838120	6838640	All right.
6838640	6840520	Everybody gets a hat.
6840520	6842440	Everybody gets one.
6842440	6843520	Everybody gets a hat.
6843520	6844040	All right.
6844040	6845360	Oh, I like that better than my hat.
6845360	6846160	That's nice.
6846160	6847040	Here we go.
6847040	6848280	Is this felt?
6848280	6849320	It is now.
6849320	6851920	Mine's a velvet.
6851920	6852440	All right.
6852440	6854080	Well, we better get the fuck out of here.
6854080	6855120	Is that a shrove talking?
6855120	6855920	No, a shrove left.
6855920	6856960	Oh, a shrove left.
6856960	6857640	Oh, OK.
6857640	6861120	We need a name for our troop.
6861120	6862600	The evacuators.
6862600	6863160	Right.
6863160	6864360	The evacuators?
6864360	6864880	Yep.
6864880	6865480	All right.
6865480	6868720	How about the quitters?
6868720	6870840	By any other name.
6870840	6874680	How about Hat Squad?
6874680	6875600	Bad pitch.
6875600	6880560	How about the stool heads?
6880560	6881920	No.
6881920	6885240	You know, we've got our whole adventure to come up with a name.
6885240	6887960	Yeah, let's talk about it in our first campfire.
6887960	6890200	Let's not do what a lot of other groups do.
6890200	6891960	They make a big mistake by trying to come up
6891960	6893080	with their whole brand.
6893080	6893960	Let's hit the road.
6893960	6895320	Before they find out what the brand is.
6895320	6896920	Why put in front of the other?
6896920	6898680	We don't even know if we're going to get along.
6898720	6901440	We don't even rejigger the whole hierarchy once we get out of here.
6901440	6904760	Let's get out of here and see where the silver flame leads us.
6904760	6905840	Let's see where it is.
6908840	6914160	I go into a druidic tramps, and I try to talk and communicate
6914160	6917360	with the god of the silver flame, Spencer.
6917360	6923720	And I ask, what's the spirit that we talk to, the girl?
6923720	6926320	It's kind of like the embodiment of this silver flame.
6926320	6927640	What?
6927640	6929040	Forget her.
6929040	6930400	What are you talking about?
6930400	6932880	Isn't there some sort of person that, when you pray,
6932880	6936280	you kind of communicate with a certain voice?
6936280	6937480	Yeah, the silver flame.
6937480	6938000	OK.
6938000	6939480	Yeah, but there's that Joan of Arc figure
6939480	6944160	that there's that young woman that originally
6944160	6946240	merged with the silver flame itself.
6946240	6946760	Yeah.
6946760	6948800	OK, but I can just talk directly to the silver flame.
6948800	6950080	I don't need any intermediaries.
6950080	6951080	You don't need to know her.
6951080	6952280	She became part of it.
6952280	6954480	Oh, the silver flame.
6954480	6955680	It's Daphne.
6955680	6956060	You're kidding.
6956060	6956480	I'm kidding.
6956480	6957000	I'm kidding.
6957320	6958040	I do that sometimes.
6958040	6962360	We, our but humble servants, failed in our attempts
6962360	6966120	to please you and to purify this land of evils.
6966120	6971240	We seek forgiveness, guidance.
6975360	6975880	That was just it.
6975880	6977120	That's the only answer.
6977120	6979920	I said, let's just go.
6979920	6980560	I wait.
6980560	6982160	I wait and see if I hear any guidance.
6982160	6986160	Like, give us a point as a departure, a destination,
6986160	6991000	like a first stop on this new line of adventure
6991000	6995840	and conquest of evil throughout your domain.
6995840	6998160	You don't really get any sense.
6998160	7000120	All right, let's get the fuck out of here.
7000120	7002920	Let's just go away from the town where we're wanted by the.
7002920	7006160	What if his gem's just in the pawn shop?
7006160	7009840	Let's just get out of here just because it's.
7009840	7012720	OK, let's get our hats on.
7012720	7013720	Hats on.
7013720	7015240	Shambles, we got the.
7015240	7016000	Locking it up.
7016000	7016720	We got the bread.
7016720	7017600	We got some snacks.
7017600	7018520	I got some snacks.
7018520	7020200	And if you want to check the gem shops,
7020200	7022280	and then we'll we could meet you.
7022280	7023440	We'll meet you up the road.
7023440	7024960	Yeah, let me just check them out.
7024960	7025960	OK, well, we'll meet you.
7025960	7027920	Sometimes thieves try to pawn up their stuff.
7027920	7032240	All right, well, we'll meet you by the lesson in San Francisco.
7032240	7034240	Just start heading.
7034240	7035600	We'll head north north.
7035600	7037120	OK, and we'll meet you.
7037120	7038680	We'll meet up with you.
7038680	7040480	Go check those gem shops.
7040480	7041760	All right, let's go.
7041760	7045280	Let's get the fuck out of here.
7045280	7047560	We're going to get the fuck out of here.
7047560	7048560	We're in big trouble.
7048560	7050400	So we just we just left diarrhea junior
7050400	7051520	behind in a pawn shop.
7051520	7053240	Spencer, I'm going to the pawn shops.
7053240	7053800	All right.
7053800	7055600	He kept.
7055600	7056720	He goes to the pawn shop.
7056720	7058560	You go to the pawn shop.
7058560	7062680	There's not a pawn shop so much as there is a guy with a guy.
7062680	7064680	Excuse me.
7064680	7066720	So much as there is a guy with a merchant
7066720	7069600	stall full of garbage and shit.
7069600	7073360	Hey, merchant guy.
7073360	7075400	Do you got any gems?
7075400	7078080	Hmm.
7078080	7082760	Nah, man, gems are expensive and they're not very useful.
7082760	7085280	We don't really get that kind of stuff around here.
7085280	7088000	Who does get that kind of stuff?
7088000	7089000	I don't know, man.
7089000	7093080	Like investors, like rich people.
7093080	7095120	Where do I find the rich people?
7095120	7096000	Not here, man.
7096000	7097600	This is Poresville.
7097600	7100360	But where's the richville?
7100360	7104400	All over the universe, I'd imagine.
7104400	7106440	DJ?
7106440	7107680	Well, we're on the road.
7107680	7109360	I'm just yelling, DJ.
7109360	7110200	Yeah, maybe.
7110200	7114600	Is there another place I could look for someone selling gems?
7114600	7117080	Where do people go to sell their gems?
7117080	7119680	People can go wherever they want.
7119680	7124720	Maybe they make agreements with people to buy and sell gems
7124720	7128800	and then they go in accordance with those arrangements.
7128800	7131000	It's very nonspecific.
7131000	7133480	Or is it very specific?
7133480	7135680	Well, I'm going to miss that kid.
7135680	7136720	Yeah, me too.
7136720	7138560	I hope we see him again.
7138560	7140520	Do you have any cool things I could buy?
7140520	7141760	Yeah, man.
7141760	7142600	Splits you guys.
7142600	7143680	Splits you guys out.
7143680	7144640	What is it?
7144640	7146240	It's a magical spray.
7146240	7148000	Hell yeah, what does it do?
7148000	7148920	It knocks you out.
7148920	7150400	He sprays it in your eyes.
7150400	7151120	Oh, jeez.
7151120	7151960	Cliffhanger!
