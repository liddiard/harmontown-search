0	19280	From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, The Nerdist Theater, Carman Town is now in
19280	29280	Hollywood, I'm dancing to it now, it's all over me
29280	33280	Let's bring out Spencer Crichton and everybody
33280	47280	Spencer Crichton, I'm the mayor of Harman Town, dead Harman
47280	63280	Thank you for coming to the show I'm doing
63280	80280	My therapist recommended a book for me and she just told me the title and then I got it
80280	83280	and then the guy started talking and it's an ADD book
83280	86280	I think I might be on the verge of a diagnosis
86280	90280	But you could tell because I was like, you want to recommend any other books?
90280	92280	And she's like, just let me know how this one goes
92280	98280	But I think she's very begrudging, because I'm a self-diagnoser
98280	101280	I think she wanted to put the kibosh on that right away
101280	104280	She's like, you're not fucking autistic, you pose her
104280	110280	And I am, and it's hard to pay attention to this book about ADD
110280	118280	It's hard to, it literally, honestly, it's not even a joke because the guy that wrote it as ADD
118280	122280	and he's a doctor that diagnoses it, which makes you think, wait, is this the stuff with Garrett Morris?
122280	127280	Is it just a thing that spreads? Look it up, the blob
127280	133280	But I've got to calm down, because here's the thing
133280	143280	The beginning of the book, it even went so far
143280	149280	ADD people have a hard time finishing books, and this book was made with that in mind
149280	156280	But with that in mind, they did not go that extra mile to make it accessible to ADD people, I don't think
156280	158280	It was very slow-paced
158280	162280	That sounds like a great way to get away with writing a shitty book
162280	167280	There's two versions of the book, when I look on audiobooks, it's called
167280	173280	Driven to Distraction, or not Driven to Distraction, Delivered from Distraction
173280	177280	The former is like a Harlequin romance novel
177280	183280	If you get the name of your ADD book wrong, you might have ADD
183280	189280	But there's two versions, and they're with a slightly different colored cover, and one is 3 hours and one is 12 hours
189280	194280	And then I could only get the 3 hour one because I wasn't on Wi-Fi
194280	200280	And then he begins, he says, this is the 3 hour version, because you have ADD
200280	204280	But then also in addition to that, very boring, very boring book
204280	207280	But now Dan, you're an Adderall user, enthusiast
207280	210280	And I thought, illegitimately
210280	216280	But imagine my surprise to find out I'm on medication
216280	221280	But the people I know that actually have that are diagnosed with ADD or ADHD
221280	227280	And they take Adderall, they don't get a beat that actually just restores their memory
227280	233280	Having listened to 15 minutes of this 12 hour audiobook, I can tell you, there's a lot of misconceptions
233280	237280	First of all, everybody's different, that's what you'll hear about, everything
237280	244280	It should be called attention fluctuation disorder, if it was going to be named in a way that would help you
244280	250280	People have hyper focus that have ADD, people are easily distracted
250280	257280	They're just scattered, it's all over the place
257280	262280	You have hyper empathy, there's a lot of overlap with things that you could see
262280	269280	You could diagnose somebody being bipolar, a lot of the things, both bipolar people and ADD people
269280	277280	They could feel identically in certain situations, like at certain times you'd be like
277280	281280	Oh, that person's bipolar or ADD, and it could be the other thing
281280	291280	Both of those categories, in spite of all outward empirical evidence that you're doing fine
291280	295280	You could feel like you're a piece of shit and you need to just eat a bucket of shit and jump off a roof
295280	298280	Like ADD people can feel that way
298280	302280	And then the other thing that I thought was really valuable to know, which I should have just googled in the first place
302280	305280	Because you always sit around and ask this stuff and you never look it up
305280	310280	ADHD versus ADD, it's not like ADD and then you add an H
310280	319280	They changed the name to ADHD, you can have a form of ADHD in which you're not hyperactive
319280	324280	It's called ADHD minus the H, they don't call it ADD
324280	327280	They changed the name, there's some clinicians that continue to use it
327280	328280	The new DSM changed it up
328280	329280	Yeah
329280	333280	That's why Autism, or no, that's why Asperger's is now just part of Autism
333280	334280	It's like the same
334280	335280	Yeah
335280	336280	It's exciting stuff
336280	338280	It's super exciting, super exciting stuff
338280	343280	What do you think your hyper thing is? What are you hyper about?
343280	349280	Oh, I don't know, look, I don't got nothing until somebody tells me I do
349280	353280	But you want it though, you're excited about a diagnosis
353280	357280	No, I want cheap Adderall and I got that
357280	361280	Because I told a pharmacist from Yelp that I had trouble watching movies or something
361280	363280	I don't even remember what he asked
363280	365280	He asked three questions and said you definitely have ADD
365280	368280	Which I know you're never supposed to say, you definitely have anything as a doctor
368280	371280	So, but I found him on Yelp
371280	380280	But what I have, okay, here's some things that I have that I'd be relieved to learn were symptomatic
380280	384280	I have a very, very, and not because they would excuse the behavior
384280	388280	Because they would help me, they would empower me to go like I gotta work on that, you know
388280	392280	I just have a really hard time being interrupted, you may notice that
392280	394280	Sometimes I snap at you a little bit
394280	396280	If I'm in the middle of like a point or something
396280	397280	It reminds me of a story
397280	400280	What the fuck, I'm trying to talk
400280	405280	Easy, easy joke, we rehearsed that backstage
405280	408280	But if I could be in the middle of a tweet
408280	413280	Like a fucking dumb observation that Trump is a dick or something
413280	415280	And my girlfriend could come over
415280	418280	And I'm like, I'm tweeting, I'm in the middle of a tweet
418280	419280	And I'm like trying to reword
419280	421280	Or I could be in the middle of a thought
421280	425280	Or let alone like then you bring like addictive things like Minecraft or something into that
425280	427280	Or if I'm in the middle of a train of thought
427280	431280	Even though I just ramble, I don't have a right to be upset when people interrupt me
431280	433280	I would never stop talking if nobody interrupted me
434280	436280	But interruption is like I have a harder
436280	440280	I get distracted and I'll either go like wait, what, what, what
440280	444280	Or I'll like pretend I'm listening
444280	445280	I'll be like okay, yeah, yeah, yeah
445280	447280	And I'll be burping while I'm talking
447280	449280	And the person will think I'm listening to them
449280	450280	And I'm not, you know
450280	454280	It's kind of like a hyper focus is what that is I think
454280	456280	And like so knowing that you have that
456280	458280	You go like okay, I'm gonna work on that, you know
458280	460280	And there's like things I'm excited to learn about
460280	463280	Called like interactive metronome or something like that
463280	465280	I don't know, sounds like some kind of
465280	467280	Sounds fun
467280	470280	There's like treatments, you can treat yourself, you know
470280	473280	I think everybody should, when we go to the moon
473280	474280	We should all treat ourselves
474280	475280	Here's what we're gonna do
475280	477280	We're gonna treat ourselves in both sets of the words
477280	481280	We're gonna all, everyone's personality is gonna be a disease
481280	484280	What's your name sir?
484280	485280	Tom
485280	487280	Tom, you have tomism
487280	490280	You have hyper tom disorder
490280	495280	Or inappropriate tom disorder
495280	497280	Like you are a tom
497280	499280	But that doesn't mean you get to just run around
499280	500280	Barfing on people and go
500280	503280	I'm a tom, that's how tom rolls
503280	507280	It's an invitation for other people to accept who you are
507280	509280	Oh, that's tom, he has tomism
509280	512280	And then also the other side is you gotta be
512280	515280	They're gonna do that because they think that when you go home
515280	517280	You're like, you owe it to them to be like
517280	520280	Fucking tomism, I gotta work on this shit
520280	522280	Until I'm like
522280	525280	What do you think are the noticeable symptoms of tomism?
525280	528280	Do they have a polite smirk, you know
532280	535280	We threw through the
535280	541280	Odd futuristic members only windbreaker and
541280	543280	It's a general handsomeness
544280	546280	Latent hoodie
546280	549280	Latent hoodie tendencies
549280	553280	Yeah, not sure if there's a hood or not
553280	556280	Could just be doing equipment back there
556280	557280	Oh, okay
557280	559280	What am I, what am I, an insult comic?
559280	561280	You're gonna make fun of your
561280	564280	You called his name a disease
564280	566280	You know what I was doing
566280	568280	I know
568280	572280	What I was doing was beautiful
572280	573280	It's a beautiful idea
573280	575280	Everyone says another thing
575280	578280	Now I know whenever I share beautiful things with you guys
578280	581280	And I sense that you guys don't appreciate me enough
581280	583280	It's just the disease
583280	586280	You guys aren't assholes
586280	588280	I used to think I was a piece of shit
588280	590280	And that you guys are making me feel that way
590280	592280	I would go home and I'd go
592280	593280	That audience
593280	594280	I love them
594280	597280	But we gotta figure this shit out
597280	599280	But now I know it's just all in my head
599280	601280	You're just a bunch of people sitting around
601280	602280	Who knows what you're thinking
602280	604280	They're all just, they all have diseases
604280	605280	Yeah
605280	611280	Yeah, you're Mary, Mary, Marietis and Ralph-ists
614280	619280	Let's put the pressure of entertainment tonight on some wonderful guests, huh?
619280	620280	Who do we got?
620280	621280	Oh, god damn it
621280	622280	I don't know their human names
622280	623280	I only know where they're from
623280	626280	Oh, are you talking about Sarah and Beth?
626280	628280	I am talking about Sarah and Beth
628280	629280	Do you know where they're from?
629280	636280	They're from a really celebrated, hot, awesome web site
640280	641280	But should we know their last names?
641280	644280	Should we introduce them by their last names, too, before we say?
644280	647280	I think that would only be professional, yes
647280	650280	So where to do that? Hold on, I'm just gonna pull up
650280	651280	Okay, here we go
651280	653280	Are you saying their full name's offhand?
653280	654280	Do you not know that?
654280	655280	No, I don't
655280	657280	And I'm gonna be honest because I have ADD
657280	659280	Don't worry about me
659280	665280	Folks, please welcome Beth Newell and Sarah Papalardo from Reductress
677280	678280	All right
678280	683280	Yeah, so, so, all right, Reductress is a
683280	684280	Do you want us to say it?
684280	685280	Yeah, no, no, let me take a shot
685280	686280	Okay, yeah
688280	696280	Reductress is a parody, satirical web news site
696280	699280	with a feminist point of view
699280	703280	but it could be satirizing both the feminist point of view and the world around us
703280	705280	It's, no?
705280	708280	Yeah, I would say that's an A-
708280	710280	That's good, that's pretty damn good
710280	712280	In a world where there's such a thing as web news
712280	714280	and we're all getting our news from the web
714280	716280	and I don't know why click hole is not more popular
716280	721280	It's one of the few attempts in a post newspaper world
721280	724280	where we all recognized that the onion was doing something important
724280	728280	and then the web became this horrible cesspool
728280	733280	and comedy seemed to just, that onion instinct seemed to just go
733280	736280	Or maybe there's not enough demand for it
736280	741280	Click hole should be, it should be more powerful
741280	744280	People should be constantly like, oh I'm so happy that someone's pointing out
744280	747280	how click hole is pointing out how we're all fucked
747280	752280	I don't think most of the world knows how fucked up the internet is yet
752280	755280	so they don't even understand what click hole is doing
755280	758280	It's really hard to satirize garbage
758280	760280	It parodies itself
760280	763280	You guys seem like you're probably a little younger than me
763280	765280	I don't see any, I'm not going to objectify you
765280	767280	but you seem smooth and
768280	770280	Thank you
770280	771280	Dannard
771280	774280	Dan, they are certainly younger than you
774280	778280	Do you have opinions? Do you think that it's hot?
782280	784280	As a woman? No, no absolutely not
784280	786280	Do young women still have opinions?
786280	793280	Do you have opinions about generational stuff versus like relationship with irony
794280	797280	I'm 44, I've sat up here a lot and said like
797280	801280	I don't think the kids are, I don't think they get irony as much
801280	803280	Really? Because when we talk to our parents we're like
803280	805280	we don't think they get what we're doing
805280	808280	Yeah, no, they don't see irony at all
808280	811280	But everyone thought that irony was dead when Obama got elected
811280	813280	I don't think it went anywhere
813280	815280	We still have it
815280	819280	But is it, I mean, do you guys tweet and stuff? Do you ever tweet bits?
820280	823280	Do you find, then people tweet back
823280	826280	If you tweeted, I'm trying to think of a simple example
826280	829280	You make a joke that's a question and someone answers the question
829280	831280	Or you make a joke that's like pointing out
831280	834280	You're like, boy, I can't believe Tom Cruise didn't do this
834280	837280	And then someone will go like, well that's because he's a celebrity
839280	842280	Or they'll just repeat your joke
842280	845280	For that matter, I can't believe Tom Cruise didn't do that
845280	847280	And I'll be like, that was my bit, you dick
848280	851280	That's when I wonder if they're actually more ironically detached than me
851280	855280	Like they're doing a bit that's just more irritating than my bit
855280	859280	What you're talking about, women and minorities get it like x10 on Twitter
859280	862280	Because people are just like, I don't think they know what they're saying
862280	864280	Let me explain it to them
864280	868280	Oh yeah, well also there's the whole thing of, and I promise I'm not white knighting by saying this
868280	870280	I think this is fucking fascinating
870280	875280	We spend half of our time saying, wanting to debate whether women are funny
876280	882280	And then the other half of the time when women, the funny women who therefore say things that are crazy sometimes
882280	884280	That are a little inappropriate
884280	890280	We fuck it, come on, we clam down on them harder than any dude, right?
890280	892280	I mean, you're biased, probably you're women
893280	895280	But you notice that, right?
896280	897280	Yeah
898280	900280	Okay, here's a question
901280	910280	As women that are doing comedy, are you guys of the camp of like, oh suck it up buttercup because we want to be judged on how funny we are
910280	917280	Or are you of the camp of like, Jesus Christ, people need to realize that the perception is all out of whack
917280	919280	I don't want to give you that choice, why is there a dichotomy?
919280	921280	The second choice?
921280	923280	I would say it's a little bit of both
924280	931280	On the one hand, I don't want to be judged because I'm a woman, like my work, because I'm a woman
931280	934280	I want to be judged for what I actually make
934280	937280	But at the same time, it is fucking hard for women to do this
937280	940280	Because it always becomes about, how did you do it?
940280	946280	You don't see male comedians' memoirs the way that you see Amy Schumer and everyone
946280	949280	Because everyone's just way more obsessed with, how did they do it?
949280	953280	How did they claw their way out of that womanly pile of garbage?
953280	961280	Well for sure, Jim Belushi wrote a book and said that when he was six years old, he found a piece of gravel up his little brother's ass
961280	966280	That wouldn't be coming up over and over again and every critique of everything he said on the internet
966280	970280	Plus, you're an incestuous pedophile, you found gravel up your little brother's butt
970280	973280	It'd be like, no, it's Jim Belushi, it's his book, he probably didn't even write it
973280	981280	And like, I'd say, Lena Dunham is a tremendously entertaining person to me
981280	985280	She's not a senator, she's not gonna say shit that's like, whatever
985280	990280	I'm not trying to kiss your ass, I don't view you as being part of a biomass with Lena Dunham
990280	991280	Trying to put rocks in my ass
991280	993280	Come on Harmon, get your shit together
993280	997280	You've got 20 minutes left to prove to these women that you're a feminist
999280	1001280	The meter is running
1001280	1003280	We're waiting
1007280	1015280	In a more general sense, pulling back to just doing, you're on a website, you're parodying a cesspool
1015280	1022280	Which parodies itself, do you guys have any, are you guys like the head honchos at Reductress?
1022280	1023280	Yeah
1023280	1026280	So do you guys, you started it as partners?
1026280	1029280	You said, let's fucking do this, did you have to seek out investors?
1029280	1032280	I just got distracted by a whole line of questioning, but go with it
1032280	1037280	We've been bootstrapping, so we've just been like, doing it hand to mouth for a few years
1037280	1039280	Do you monetize?
1039280	1041280	We do monetize
1041280	1044280	I don't know if you noticed though, the internet is a shit place to make money
1044280	1049280	So you make money doing other stuff like events and podcasts as well
1049280	1051280	But you saw advertising and stuff?
1051280	1052280	Yeah, we do
1052280	1057280	Okay, so now getting back to, so when you sat down and said, this is worth trying, it's gonna be brutal
1057280	1059280	Cause there's no way to monetize it, it's gonna fucking suck
1059280	1065280	Uphill battle, do you have a, do you have like a comedic mission statement?
1065280	1067280	Does that make sense, is that a question?
1067280	1072280	Yeah, I mean the comedic mission statement was mostly just like, women's media sucks
1072280	1076280	And it doesn't represent us, and we're smarter than this
1076280	1079280	Talk about the landscape unless it's gonna get you in trouble
1079280	1086280	Like, express that frustration, like when you look at the pre-reductress landscape of women's comedy
1086280	1089280	Like, what do you see the sins being?
1089280	1094280	I mean, I think the big one was the way that women's magazines talk down to women
1094280	1098280	And use fear and insecurity to make them buy things, ultimately
1098280	1103280	And then later on we started seeing empowerment marketing, like the Dove ads
1103280	1107280	Also using empowerment and feminism in order to sell things
1107280	1110280	So it basically all revolves around that
1110280	1115280	What are examples of that that woke me up more?
1115280	1122280	Like, if I see a thing and I'm a guy and I see something and it's like, high five this woman for doing this
1122280	1127280	Or like, I often, sometimes I see things and I think in the back of my head
1127280	1132280	I'm like, that's fucking dumb, like if I were a woman that would make me mad
1132280	1135280	But then I don't know if it would make you mad
1135280	1139280	It definitely does, I think that part of the frustration was a lot of men see that
1139280	1143280	And they're like, they don't think that thing's dumb, they think women are dumb and like that thing
1143280	1144280	That's so fucking, okay
1144280	1147280	So we were trying to point that out, like we're like, we don't want this
1147280	1151280	Yeah, we're not in charge of the internet, that's really, that's, okay, you're blowing my mind
1151280	1155280	I never, that's true, I think, but that's true
1155280	1159280	Like, you have a tendency to, because we have preconceived investments emotionally
1159280	1164280	We definitely found that out, like that we, no matter who we are
1164280	1168280	That we had like, we had stacks of poker chips in this game that we did not
1168280	1172280	No one ever made us count, we were like, so if somebody says
1172280	1177280	Look at this body positive parade marshal
1181280	1182280	Episode title
1186280	1191280	You're like, there's things that they, well, they're trying to get clicks in those
1191280	1195280	So you're clicking the turnstile that's created, like includes these like, attitudes
1195280	1200280	So you can say, Charlie Sheen just started a new massage parlor
1200280	1204280	And you're like, okay, you're only clicking on it if that interests you
1204280	1208280	And it only interests you if A, you're a big Charlie Sheen fan or a big fan of massage
1208280	1213280	Or if Charlie Sheen's a clown, do you want to like, really get some shit off your chest in the comment section
1213280	1219280	And so, like, the stuff that has to do with women, like, it, like, that Charlie Sheen thing
1219280	1223280	I never think in my head, oh, why is Charlie Sheen making me try to, you know
1223280	1229280	Why does he want me to think things about him other than he's into massage and is a good businessman
1229280	1231280	I'm going to go disabuse him of that notion
1231280	1239280	But if somebody tweets, like, oh, Amy Schumer's new music video does this and that
1239280	1243280	And it's not, she doesn't get to be in charge of how her joke is being delivered
1243280	1247280	And then you go, and you go, I'm going to let this bitch know that women aren't funny
1248280	1249280	Thank you
1254280	1256280	Yeah, I mean, I
1259280	1261280	We'll be right back
1265280	1267280	Dove soap
1268280	1271280	We'll caress your body
1272280	1277280	I don't know. I guess I, I guess I kind of acted like I was teeing you guys up to say something
1278280	1284280	I mean, it's interesting because it seems like, you know, Charlie Sheen, amid all his flaws, just exists
1284280	1294280	Like, he is objectively existing and yet a woman is just a thing to place all of your, project all of your fears, insecurities and anger on too
1294280	1297280	Like, I don't, it just seems like it's all our job to have opinions about women
1297280	1298280	Right
1298280	1300280	But it just doesn't work the same way for men
1300280	1307280	Do you think that that's, not to set you up to sound like a, like, I don't know, not to set you up to sound anyway
1307280	1319280	But, do you think that that is localized culturally, like chronologically, or do you think that that is like a weird, like, like, crazy primate condition
1319280	1326280	That the, that women are scary to men and kind of like, and maybe scary to each other
1326280	1329280	And like, there's like this weird flow of energy in that direction
1329280	1335280	I think we've been conditioned by media to, like, fear women, especially if they're in a position of power
1335280	1343280	So, like, that's, all the media we've seen where we see a woman in charge, she's like a horrible boss and she sucks
1343280	1345280	And there's just, like, no examples out there
1345280	1349280	Because I think, with Charlie Sheen, like, he can be this garbage mess of a person
1349280	1350280	But we love him
1350280	1351280	And he, we love him
1351280	1356280	And then in five years we could say he, like, fixed all his problems and people would forgive him and he'd make a new movie
1356280	1359280	And there'd be some, like, redemption story
1359280	1363280	But if a woman did that, we would always be like, she's a garbage pile of shit
1363280	1364280	It's just Lindsay Lohan
1364280	1367280	And then, like, she just never comes back and it's sad
1367280	1370280	There is a, yeah, I can look at myself and feel that
1370280	1375280	Like, from my 20s, like, before I started, like, examining that stuff, maybe
1375280	1380280	I, like, it, you're punching down before you know you're punching down
1380280	1383280	Like, because you think you're punching up because you're a guy
1383280	1386280	And, like, women are just, like, they're just important
1386280	1389280	And, and they didn't buy a ticket to that ride
1389280	1391280	And they're also not all the same thing
1391280	1393280	But to you they are because of your situation
1393280	1399280	And that, combined with, with, with privilege, equals, like, the situation
1399280	1401280	Where it's, like, you can't get out of the starting gate
1401280	1404280	If you were to say, I'm gonna be a woman and I'm gonna be funny in this way
1404280	1407280	And it's, like, yeah, why am I explaining this shit to you?
1407280	1408280	The patriarchy, man
1408280	1411280	If only there was a word for me explaining it to you
1411280	1414280	It does feel like punching up, though
1414280	1417280	I think when you're taking down a person who's in such a high level of power
1417280	1420280	Like, Lena Dunham and Amy Schumer, they're, like, so successful
1420280	1422280	You're, like, I can make fun of them
1422280	1424280	But then, at the same time, you're, like, as women
1424280	1426280	It's, like, we only got two this year
1426280	1428280	You know, like, it's, like, you guys had a lot
1428280	1432280	You know, so you're, like, oh, you're taking down our one person, you know
1432280	1436280	I was, I was, I was, I think this is related, I swear to God
1437280	1442280	I was watching a documentary about sex dolls
1443280	1445280	And sex robots
1445280	1446280	Hear him out, hear him out
1449280	1450280	There's a couple of these
1450280	1453280	There's a documentary about guys who have their sex dolls
1453280	1458280	This was the thing about guys who are dedicated to the dream of inventing sex dolls
1458280	1461280	The guys who are engineering them and the guys who can't wait to be their first customer
1461280	1462280	Yeah, I think I saw that one
1462280	1463280	It's good
1463280	1466280	And the thing that I, I hope I can articulate this
1466280	1469280	Because I feel like I noticed this
1470280	1473280	Is that, like, every, even in spite of the fact that these guys are in their garage
1473280	1475280	Like, making sex dolls, and then the other guys are like
1475280	1477280	I can't wait to have a sex robot
1478280	1483280	They, when they get to, when they grace the topics of, like, just sex in general
1483280	1487280	Even though they're supposed to be deconstructing it with, with pride
1487280	1488280	And with a lawn
1488280	1493280	They still go, like, you know, there's the pelvic thrust for certain other activities
1493280	1495280	If you know what I mean
1495280	1497280	And it's like, what do you mean if I know what you mean
1497280	1500280	This whole thing, there's a camera crew in your garage
1500280	1502280	You're making a dick piston like this
1504280	1506280	Why, just, just talk like it's NASCAR
1506280	1511280	And here's the thing, like, like, the, the guys that are waiting for the sex robots
1511280	1512280	Who also talk like that
1512280	1515280	They go, like, like, oh, and I'm looking for a certain thing if you know what I mean
1515280	1520280	And like, kind of like, for certain visceral topics that wouldn't, by nature, be offensive
1520280	1524280	They, like, the, the guys that are inventing the sex robots
1524280	1527280	By, by virtue of the fact that they're making them in their garage
1527280	1532280	And it's hard to make beautiful, uh, things, um, by scratch
1532280	1534280	Uh, with lumber and nails
1534280	1535280	Um
1535280	1536280	The
1536280	1537280	Ouch
1537280	1540280	Fucking Apple II-E of sex robots
1540280	1541280	Yeah
1541280	1542280	The shitty tube monitor
1542280	1547280	To the extent that the sex robots are able to, for instance, move or talk
1547280	1551280	All of that budget in your sim city of, like, what makes a sex robot
1551280	1555280	It all goes away from, like, physical attractiveness, kind of
1555280	1561280	Like, it's hard to, like, it's already hard to make a thing that looks like a beautiful human being in the first place
1561280	1565280	And then these guys are trying to make a thing that, like, acts right and talks right and goes like this
1565280	1566280	And so
1567280	1572280	But what I noticed for that reason is that then they would go to these, these guys who are connoisseurs
1572280	1577280	And pay it forward to connoisseurs of sex robots that don't exist yet
1577280	1582280	And, and all of them as they intercut between them talking about this guy's new sex robot
1582280	1585280	He's like, I'm an, I'm unveiling a sex robot and it just looks like David Lee Roth
1585280	1586280	Like, it's like
1587280	1591280	Because he's focused on all this other functionality and the thing just looks like your uncle in a wig
1591280	1592280	And, and
1593280	1597280	And just as I'm doing right now, it's like those guys, they cut between them and all those guys that are like
1597280	1601280	If you know what I mean about all that, like, stuff that has to do with their intimacy
1601280	1603280	Them wanting pleasure
1604280	1607280	When they got to say that it's ugly
1608280	1611280	Like, they just relax, you can see the weight come off of their shoulders
1611280	1615280	And I don't know how to, I was like, I paused it and I was, like, saying, like, there's something important here
1615280	1619280	Because, like, these guys are going, like, like, it's that, bringing that back around to this
1619280	1624280	It doesn't feel like punching down, but you're, like, you want, we want to punch down
1624280	1629280	Like, we have an urge, and I don't, I think that probably all human beings feel that
1629280	1634280	Like, you, we just, we all have some area where we don't, we justify it somehow
1634280	1639280	Like, I'll go, I'll be, like, in a comment section on Jezebel and, like, watching under some articles
1639280	1642280	Like, oh, like, but here's your thing
1642280	1647280	Like, here's your thing where you get to call someone a piece of fucking subhuman shit, you know
1647280	1651280	Some people need to make a robot to be, like, I'm out of her fucking league
1651280	1655280	Yeah, those guys are just, like, she's ugly
1655280	1659280	They started coming up and I said, I wouldn't fuck her with someone else's dick and all this stuff
1659280	1664280	I was, like, oh, you were just, you were just winking and nudging when you were talking about your own dick
1664280	1666280	But it's, like, I wouldn't fuck her with someone else's dick
1666280	1670280	We're talking about someone else's dick? We're talking about a robot? It's, like, it's ugly, it's ugly, it's ugly
1670280	1675280	Like, we want to just, like, we want to just drown each other because we feel like we're drowning
1675280	1680280	We want to, like, grab each other's heads and go, like, you're ugly! You're ugly, you're ugly, you're ugly
1680280	1681280	I'm not drowning
1681280	1683280	I was just in Fiji and I almost drowned
1685280	1686280	Alright, alright
1686280	1689280	Well, I told you, I told you I was a bad interviewer
1689280	1691280	I told you what I'll do
1691280	1693280	Uh, so, okay
1693280	1695280	Okay, would you want to meet my friend Brandon Johnson? He's black
1695280	1696280	Yeah
1696280	1697280	He's black, okay
1698280	1700280	Brandon, come out
1700280	1702280	Brandon Johnson
1713280	1714280	You're not doing it
1719280	1721280	I think the magic's already started
1723280	1724280	What's up, man?
1724280	1725280	Welcome
1725280	1726280	I'm so happy to be here. Thanks for having me back, Dan
1726280	1727280	Thank you
1727280	1728280	It's an honor to share the stage
1728280	1733280	This sweater and this vest and this shirt, like, how do you outdress me every goddamn time?
1733280	1737280	I think, what would an old-timey black man from the 30s wear?
1738280	1747280	See, you know, like, I have, have we talked about this before, you and I, I want to be, like, one of those 70, 80-year-old dudes that has a kick-ass cane
1747280	1750280	You know, like a big, like a, like a bitching hat
1750280	1751280	Yeah
1751280	1756280	And, like, just one of those cool old dudes that you see walking down the road and, like, you can pull off like a cane with, like, an owl
1756280	1757280	head on it
1757280	1762280	Yeah, I want it to be, I want it to be full of Jameson and a little bit of weed and a little bit of cocaine
1762280	1763280	Thanks, thanks
1763280	1768280	So that when I bump into some young dude and he's like, you old motherfucker, and I can be like, look here, young buck, look here
1770280	1772280	Got cocaine and marijuana, young buck
1775280	1777280	I'm not so unimpressive after all
1777280	1778280	Now
1778280	1781280	And then hit that motherfucker with my cane
1782280	1787280	I've changed my ambition, I want to be at any point in my life where I'm confident in calling anybody Youngblood
1790280	1791280	What's up, youngblood
1791280	1792280	Don't pray for what you want, man
1793280	1795280	I hate young black dudes, man
1796280	1799280	Because they do not, they give you that look like, you're not cool no more
1800280	1801280	They can smell it
1801280	1802280	You're an old black dude
1803280	1810280	Which is tragic, old black woman with, like, if she's standing back behind the counter and she serves you a pork chop, you're like, oh, thanks, old black lady
1810280	1812280	That's probably gonna be delicious to shit
1812280	1818280	But if an old black man in this sweater handed you a pork chop, you'd be like, fuck that
1819280	1821280	What did you do wrong in life?
1823280	1825280	That's a very interesting
1826280	1828280	But thank you for the compliment
1830280	1833280	I would just say that you look like a very well-dressed older black gentleman
1834280	1837280	I'm just trying to find out who killed bumpy knuckles
1837280	1842280	Like a fuckin' 1910 black detective
1842280	1848280	Is that a, is that a, wait, is that a reference or an awesome riff of, like, a Ursatz black detective
1848280	1850280	You haven't heard about the death of bumpy knuckles?
1851280	1853280	It's in all the papers
1853280	1856280	Is there any, is there a Charlie Chan for, but black?
1856280	1861280	Like, is there like an old-timey detective archetype that was a
1861280	1862280	Shaft
1862280	1863280	Well
1864280	1868280	I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna throw his detective work under the bus, but
1870280	1878280	I'm saying, I mean, going back to Charlie Chan days when it was like, is there like a classic, like, Uncle Ben of detecting
1882280	1884280	There's not, there isn't, right?
1884280	1887280	It's so hard, man, because I want to make up a dude for you right now
1889280	1891280	You don't know I could work a Charles Douche I.J.
1892280	1895280	Charles Douche I.J. was the first black actor to play a detective
1896280	1898280	And arrested moments later
1899280	1901280	Can I bring it back real quick?
1901280	1903280	Sarah and Beth, I have a question
1903280	1907280	Like, just because you're women and feminists and you're making like satire and stuff like that
1907280	1911280	Do you think right now with Trump being Trump and being in office and all this stuff
1911280	1916280	Do you think, and I'm hoping it's the case with the march that's gonna happen and all this stuff
1916280	1920280	Do you think there will be some awesome, like, revolution
1920280	1923280	Like, for women now, because it's so ridiculous
1923280	1926280	That we all get to actually call this shit out
1926280	1930280	And, like, women get to be full on vocal activists at all times
1931280	1937280	Yeah, I think that like 53% of white women are finally gonna, like, latch on to 90s feminism
1937280	1942280	Like, they're gonna finally catch up with the rest of the world
1943280	1946280	And then they're gonna make some, like, movie about it in 20 years
1946280	1948280	And everyone will be really self satisfied
1949280	1951280	Like First Wives Club, kind of
1953280	1956280	Do you think it'll be that flaccid? It'll be that fleeting and not actual
1956280	1958280	I don't think it's a bad thing
1958280	1965280	I just think that there's seriously a lot of people in this country that need to catch up with just, like, basic tenets of feminism
1965280	1970280	I'm not even talking about what third-wave feminism is even about
1970280	1975280	Just really basic stuff like equal pay and reproductive rights
1975280	1976280	Things like that
1976280	1978280	It allows us to have jobs, you know?
1978280	1979280	Right, right
1979280	1987280	Just basing it on the name, I would guess that third-wave feminism is about diminishing the concept entirely
1987280	1995280	Because you can't even get through that name without giving the subconscious implication that it's fleeting and has been done before and will be done again
1995280	2000280	Who came up with that phrase? Is it proud? Is everyone waving that flag?
2000280	2004280	Who came up with it? Someone in the audience probably knows better than me
2004280	2006280	It sounds like Archie Bunker came up with it
2006280	2007280	No
2007280	2009280	Geez, these third-wave feminists
2009280	2011280	Okay
2011280	2014280	You burnt your bra, you put your bra back on
2014280	2016280	Now your bra's burning, well it's on ya
2016280	2018280	I don't know what to...
2019280	2022280	When are you gonna realize you're just women?
2022280	2024280	Doesn't matter how many waves you go through
2024280	2026280	They're just waves
2026280	2028280	They come in, they go out
2028280	2030280	Isn't that kind of like a subconscious like
2030280	2033280	Yeah, we're gonna go through our grunge period soon
2033280	2035280	So it's a little awesome
2035280	2037280	It'll just be called femma junk
2037280	2039280	Femma garbage
2039280	2045280	I hope it skips 90s grunge and goes straight to like awesome punk rock like riots and shit
2045280	2047280	Uh-oh
2047280	2048280	On record
2048280	2053280	Calling for a physical, actual, prosecutable action
2054280	2056280	Alright, I'll back you up, I'm going with you
2056280	2061280	I am, I think it's time to light torches and pick up pitchforks
2061280	2063280	Because if tweeting worked
2065280	2067280	It would get you elected president
2067280	2070280	Yeah, I think, yeah, it's no problem to be on Twitter
2070280	2072280	It's the world's CB radio
2072280	2078280	But a guy used it to become our first like actual evil president
2079280	2082280	Like just got on Twitter and was like
2082280	2085280	Breaker, breaker, I should be president
2085280	2087280	And everyone that was like
2087280	2092280	Hashtagging cancel Colbert because that didn't work but that did
2092280	2096280	I think that means that Twitter's probably for listening and not so much for getting stuff done
2097280	2100280	And then you go back to old wheatpaste flyers
2100280	2102280	Wheatpaste
2102280	2104280	Put shit up on a wall that people have to see
2104280	2107280	Tell them fucking, fucking, yeah
2107280	2110280	Take down, take down the live glasses
2111280	2113280	Or put them on, put them on, I mean
2114280	2116280	Look, I don't know
2116280	2118280	I'm gonna, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
2118280	2121280	The Dan Harmon get off my lawn segment
2122280	2125280	I'm three months from caving, every time I have a rant on Twitter where I'm like
2125280	2127280	This fucking president should be in jail
2127280	2129280	And then I kind of get this nausea 30 minutes later
2129280	2132280	I'm like, what are you doing, you're playing Minecraft, you're gonna get fired
2133280	2138280	You just, don't, don't, don't lip off, no one else is, what are you and Mark Hamill, what are you doing?
2139280	2143280	Have you, have you, have you heard what Mark Hamill's doing?
2143280	2144280	Yeah, the Batman song
2144280	2145280	Fucking amazing
2145280	2149280	Like it's such a brilliant stroke of, like it's such a great example of just like every little bit
2149280	2151280	Like, like what a great thing
2151280	2155280	Like, like to just, I'm the last person to know but, so I'm explaining to no one
2155280	2160280	But he, he reads Trump's tweets in the voice of the Joker and it's fucking amazing
2160280	2164280	And it's just like, Happy New Year to all my haters
2165280	2168280	And it's so perfect
2168280	2170280	Anyways, but, but, but, but, yeah
2170280	2172280	I feel like, sometimes I feel like I'm three months out from just going
2172280	2175280	Wait a minute, what am I doing? I should just sit in a lawn chair
2175280	2177280	Put on a red baseball cap and say
2177280	2182280	Now who loves Trump so much they're willing to work for some minimum wage for me
2183280	2185280	Like I could just game the system
2185280	2187280	This is how Nazism works
2187280	2190280	Like you just, guys like me just slowly go, I'm tired
2191280	2193280	When is the Women's March the 21st, right?
2193280	2196280	Yeah, when is the, are you guys going to the Women's March?
2196280	2198280	Not that I'm assuming anything because of your gender
2198280	2199280	Oh, we're going to the one in New York
2199280	2200280	You just look like marchers
2200280	2203280	Yeah, we're just flying back so we gotta go to our own city
2203280	2205280	Oh, oh, are you based out of, not LA?
2205280	2206280	Yeah, we're in New York
2206280	2207280	Yeah, we're visiting
2207280	2208280	Cool
2208280	2210280	So, so all major cities are doing it, right?
2210280	2211280	Yeah
2211280	2212280	I know Boston is, I'm sure
2212280	2213280	Oh, oh, I didn't know that
2213280	2215280	I thought, Cody's flying to DC
2215280	2221280	Where an omnibus permit was taken out that prevents any marches during Inauguration Day
2221280	2224280	to be dedicated to anything meaningful
2224280	2228280	I want it to be a big-ass fucking free-for-all, crazy-ass, like
2228280	2232280	It's going to be huge because there's like, isn't there like four times the buses
2232280	2236280	Like there's 200 buses for Inauguration, there's 1200 buses for the Women's March
2236280	2237280	So that's impressive
2237280	2238280	Fuck yeah
2238280	2240280	I think it's going to be really calm though, actually
2240280	2241280	It's going to be like a lot of moms
2241280	2244280	It'll be organized and people will be listening to each other, it'll be amazing
2244280	2246280	Yeah, yeah
2246280	2247280	I hope that's the point of it
2247280	2250280	I hope it's fucking eight billion people
2250280	2251280	Well, that doesn't add up
2251280	2254280	But yeah, and it goes off without a hitch
2254280	2258280	I hope that reports start coming out of people trying to covertly stir shit up
2258280	2263280	And getting exposed as fucking like, you know, that they're trying desperately to do it
2263280	2264280	Because this is an important thing
2264280	2266280	Like, here's the silver lining
2266280	2267280	Like, we lost
2267280	2269280	Let's talk about left versus right
2269280	2272280	We lost, like, oh, boo-hoo, that sucks
2272280	2275280	But it's like, holy shit, we haven't lost in a long time
2276280	2279280	Like, we haven't been the people that are allowed to just do anything
2279280	2282280	With no accountability to logic
2282280	2286280	You could just say, the president's a fucking idiot
2286280	2287280	And you should be thrown in prison
2287280	2292280	And anyone that comes at you and goes like, um, please, I think these identity politics should be debated
2292280	2295280	And you're like, fuck you, have fun
2295280	2297280	Like, I'm just a fucking insurrectionist
2297280	2298280	I lost
2298280	2302280	I don't even have to fucking like, hang out and like, obey your laws
2302280	2304280	Like, I don't, I don't, I'm not saying like
2304280	2308280	The sinister part of it is like, when the Dixie Chicks talk shit about Bush
2308280	2310280	They were nearly fucking pilloried
2310280	2312280	Like, they got a bunch of flack
2312280	2316280	Now, we get to talk so much shit about Trump because he's such a buffoon
2316280	2324280	But like, that completely takes all the point of dissent and uh
2324280	2326280	What's the word I'm looking for?
2326280	2327280	Uh, taco
2327280	2328280	Taco
2329280	2331280	It takes all the taco out of it
2332280	2336280	Now, talking shit about the president, it doesn't even mean anything
2336280	2338280	It doesn't land anywhere
2338280	2343280	Like, dissent doesn't even matter anymore because who gives a fuck
2343280	2345280	I don't think that's true
2345280	2348280	If that's a defeatist statement, I don't agree with it
2348280	2349280	I don't think that's true at all
2349280	2352280	I think you can see these people in every comment section
2352280	2354280	Maybe I'm projecting because maybe it's what I want to see
2354280	2356280	Every Twitter thread, everything
2356280	2362280	I can see the confusion and the fear and the frustration that used to be ours to bear
2362280	2367280	Now being handed over to these stump-humping, redneck fuck faces
2368280	2370280	And they don't have the attention span we have
2370280	2375280	And they're not gonna vote in 2018 because they got shit to do and be dumb about
2375280	2376280	Like, they're confused
2376280	2378280	They keep saying over and over again
2378280	2379280	Why don't y'all just get back to work?
2379280	2380280	I'm sorry to make them southern
2380280	2381280	I don't know what it's about
2381280	2383280	Like, this is big
2383280	2385280	Because a lot of the Trump thing is like
2385280	2386280	It's not fucking like
2386280	2387280	We gotta not
2387280	2393280	I just did it but I'm punching down on fucking labor
2393280	2398280	But there's a big part of that movement is exploitation of those people
2398280	2401280	By people that are fucking just profiting
2401280	2404280	But all of those people across the board
2404280	2407280	All of that memeing and tweeting and all that shit
2407280	2409280	That was like Snickers bar energy
2409280	2411280	Compared to like the energy you have from eating a turkey
2411280	2414280	Like, they can't last
2414280	2415280	And they're like confused
2415280	2416280	Like, they just keep going
2416280	2417280	Yeah, but emails
2417280	2418280	And you keep going
2418280	2419280	She lost
2419280	2422280	Back to talking about how he's a dumb fuck that can't spell
2422280	2426280	And should be thrown in a hole with sharp sticks on the bottom
2426280	2428280	Whoa, butterfly bomber
2428280	2429280	Butterfly bomber!
2429280	2431280	Nothing, motherfucker!
2433280	2435280	I'm talking about my president
2436280	2438280	I'm just a dumb fucking idiot
2438280	2440280	That just wants to cause trouble
2440280	2441280	Ever heard of it?
2444280	2446280	Must suck to be in your
2446280	2448280	Not even in your first hundred days in office
2448280	2451280	And you just got a bunch of people just clawing at you like cats
2451280	2453280	Like, spreading any rumor they can
2453280	2456280	Oh god, why do you want to see my tax returns so much?
2456280	2458280	It's as if I wasn't born in America
2461280	2464280	Will you people stop at nothing to just ruin everything?
2466280	2467280	Yeah!
2468280	2470280	And it's how I always wanted to feel
2470280	2473280	But it was harder when there was this handsome, articulate black guy in office
2473280	2475280	That wanted everyone to have health care
2475280	2476280	It was harder
2476280	2478280	It was hard to wake up jaded
2478280	2479280	It was hard
2479280	2480280	Now it's easy
2480280	2482280	Now it's like the way it should be
2482280	2484280	He's a king and a fucking idiot
2484280	2485280	And I'm a fucking jester
2485280	2487280	But he's made out of
2487280	2491280	He's made out of smoke and cotton candy
2491280	2493280	You can't throw a dart that will stick in him
2493280	2494280	Because he doesn't exist
2494280	2495280	He's a concept
2495280	2497280	Like, you can't actually nail him on anything
2497280	2500280	Because he doesn't give a fuck about accuracy or truth
2500280	2501280	Who cares?
2501280	2503280	He does like 80 cartoonish things a day though
2503280	2504280	He's like Scrooge McDuck
2504280	2505280	So you're like
2505280	2507280	You're like, hey
2507280	2508280	That crazy thing he did
2508280	2509280	He's already on to the next one
2509280	2510280	Like, he
2510280	2511280	Yeah, I mean
2511280	2512280	Which is brilliant because
2512280	2513280	Like, nothing lands
2513280	2514280	Like, he can just
2514280	2516280	That crazy fucking horrible dog shit
2516280	2517280	Oh yeah, nothing lands
2517280	2520280	It's not like if everyone starts talking about something
2520280	2522280	He won't fucking obsess about it
2522280	2524280	And start melting down on Twitter
2524280	2525280	He fucking does
2525280	2526280	I think what we should do is
2526280	2528280	Not politics, not campaign
2528280	2530280	Not policy stuff
2530280	2532280	Simply talk about how he looks
2532280	2534280	Just call him chubby
2534280	2535280	Call him chubby
2535280	2537280	If we all agree, just call him chubby pants
2537280	2539280	He'd fucking blow his brains out
2539280	2540280	He's so vain
2540280	2542280	I think you should do that
2542280	2544280	Because when you talk about how people dress
2544280	2545280	And how they look
2545280	2547280	Like, it carries weight
2547280	2548280	Like, like
2550280	2551280	It does
2551280	2552280	It does
2555280	2556280	Because it's in your essence
2556280	2559280	Because people would like you to say that they dress well
2559280	2560280	I like that shirt you wear
2566280	2567280	And I think that
2567280	2568280	I don't
2568280	2570280	You know, I think Mark Hamill
2570280	2572280	Like, should read his tweets as the Joker
2572280	2573280	And I think that
2573280	2575280	You know, I think Nabisco should say
2575280	2576280	He's not crunchy enough
2576280	2577280	I don't
2578280	2580280	I think that if you
2581280	2582280	And I think that
2582280	2583280	It doesn't
2583280	2585280	If we can monetize criticism
2585280	2586280	This might actually work
2587280	2591280	Our emphasis on how things get done
2591280	2593280	And whether something is going to work
2593280	2597280	And whether or not a bratty kid just wants your attention
2597280	2600280	And therefore you should think counter-intuitively
2600280	2603280	Like, the only silver lining of this defeat
2603280	2604280	And the situation we're in is that
2604280	2608280	We don't have to spend that much brain power on that shit anymore
2608280	2609280	You can just
2609280	2612280	Figuratively put a frag in a bottle and light it
2612280	2615280	And throw it in any general direction
2615280	2616280	Figuratively
2616280	2618280	Yeah, good luck with that shit
2619280	2622280	Some of us have a lot of work we gotta do
2623280	2625280	Digging the trenches to live in
2625280	2627280	And the caves to hide in
2627280	2628280	But you're right
2629280	2631280	You could just put that red hat on
2632280	2633280	I like your stance, though
2633280	2634280	Your stance is that
2634280	2635280	We should fuck with this dude
2635280	2637280	Until he's up out of office
2637280	2638280	Like, more than ever before
2638280	2642280	You are my second of two black friends that I have
2642280	2645280	The other one called and said they could not make it
2646280	2648280	I've had this conversation where it was like
2648280	2649280	I was like
2649280	2650280	No, you're right
2650280	2652280	Dude, you don't have to
2652280	2653280	Like, I get it
2653280	2654280	Like, I don't get it
2654280	2655280	But I get that I don't get it
2655280	2657280	And I get that it's like
2657280	2659280	I'm not gonna be like
2659280	2661280	What are you guys doing?
2661280	2662280	To women and black people
2662280	2664280	And especially not black women
2665280	2666280	Because it's like
2667280	2668280	The line was towed and all this shit
2668280	2669280	And it's like
2669280	2670280	Yeah, this is a time
2670280	2672280	As the Chappelle sketch at SNL
2672280	2673280	And it's like
2673280	2674280	Yeah, white people are like
2674280	2676280	Fucking having to deal with frustration
2676280	2677280	For the first time in their lives
2679280	2680280	Whatever
2681280	2682280	Take the bench, my friend
2683280	2684280	Yes
2684280	2685280	I am your globetrotter
2685280	2687280	I unfortunately cannot do that
2687280	2689280	As the game seems to keep coming to me
2690280	2692280	But I will say
2692280	2693280	If you're a historian
2693280	2695280	There's a way to look at
2695280	2696280	Like, what's about to happen
2696280	2697280	In a way that doesn't necessarily
2697280	2698280	Have to get you down
2698280	2699280	It's kind of interesting
2699280	2700280	Because if you're a historian
2700280	2702280	It's one of the most interesting
2702280	2703280	Things to ever happen
2703280	2705280	So, like, if you don't become an activist
2705280	2707280	There's still something interesting
2707280	2708280	About being
2708280	2710280	About paying attention to what's happening
2710280	2711280	Yeah
2711280	2712280	No matter whether you're getting into it
2712280	2713280	To stop it
2713280	2715280	Or whether you're sitting on the sidelines
2715280	2716280	Or whether you're an activist
2716280	2719280	It's still a crazy fucking time to witness
2719280	2720280	Yeah, and I think
2721280	2723280	With a potential healthy result
2724280	2725280	Like, because it is
2726280	2728280	I sat on this stage for four years
2728280	2730280	And ran my mouth about, you know
2730280	2732280	Like, bipartisan systems full of shit
2732280	2733280	And it's like
2733280	2734280	I don't know
2734280	2735280	Like, Keith Olbermann did a thing the other day
2735280	2736280	Where he was like
2736280	2737280	You know, would you trade
2737280	2739280	Like, there's a way that we could like
2739280	2741280	All just vote for Mitt Romney
2741280	2742280	Like, really search yourself
2742280	2743280	And be like
2743280	2744280	You know what?
2744280	2746280	It's like, I'm craving the bipartisan system
2746280	2749280	As comfort until we can figure out how to fix it
2749280	2750280	This is not fixing it
2750280	2752280	And like, I have to
2752280	2755280	That's making me recognize that all my anarchist bullshit
2755280	2757280	About like, oh, the system is stupid
2757280	2759280	Why do I have to choose between Coke and Pepsi?
2759280	2761280	Well, because corn syrup isn't human urine
2762280	2763280	It's bad for you
2763280	2766280	But it's not human urine bad for you
2766280	2767280	That's a bad example
2767280	2769280	Human urine is actually better for you than corn syrup, right?
2769280	2772280	Because it contains water and probably human nutrients
2772280	2773280	And delicious
2775280	2776280	Anyways, where did I
2776280	2777280	Where did we get off that?
2777280	2780280	As women and comedy people
2781280	2783280	Does your website have boobs?
2784280	2785280	No
2785280	2786280	Actually, yes
2786280	2787280	Does the
2788280	2791280	Do you guys like
2792280	2793280	It's like
2794280	2796280	Do you have to have conversations
2796280	2799280	Where you tally
2799280	2801280	Like, I'm trying to figure out
2801280	2803280	Like, I want to talk about the comedic aspect of it
2803280	2805280	Where comedy becomes industry
2805280	2807280	Where it becomes like, kind of
2808280	2809280	Where you're talking
2809280	2813280	You have to talk about shit that's not coming from just the thing you naturally want to do
2813280	2815280	Are you guys just following your bliss
2815280	2818280	Every time someone moves to write something
2818280	2821280	Or is there some kind of like, restraint
2821280	2824280	Or guidance being put on it is what I was trying to get at before
2824280	2826280	There's a lot of restraint
2826280	2828280	Yeah, I mean
2828280	2831280	We follow our bliss to a point
2831280	2834280	Where the idea actually has to be clear and readable
2834280	2837280	So that when you're scanning through Facebook or Twitter, you're like, I get that
2837280	2840280	So you have to have conversations like, well, what's the joke here?
2840280	2842280	And if it's the same as the joke and the last thing
2842280	2844280	Then, okay, let's come up with a different thing
2844280	2846280	Yeah, we got to like, reign in our bliss
2846280	2849280	I want to know what you haven't run
2849280	2851280	If there's headlines that you've turned down
2851280	2852280	Because you have so many
2852280	2853280	Your bylines are hilarious
2853280	2856280	And is there anything that you've ever been like, that's too fucked up?
2856280	2858280	All the time
2858280	2860280	Sometimes there's jokes that really appeal to us as feminists
2860280	2863280	That are sort of like, laughing at ourselves as feminists
2863280	2868280	But then we're like, what will the opposition do when they get a hold of this sort of thing?
2868280	2870280	And we're like, we can't put this out there
2870280	2875280	Because it's just a lot of like, MRA trolls will see our articles as real
2875280	2877280	As written by real women
2877280	2879280	And obviously they hate women
2879280	2883280	So every article we write is an example of how women are dumb and terrible
2883280	2885280	Because we're satirizing women's media
2885280	2889280	Yeah, like one article we put out a couple months back
2889280	2892280	If Trump wins, I'm moving to Alaska
2892280	2895280	People thought it was real
2895280	2898280	And made a call to get the writer fired
2898280	2901280	And someone wrote an open letter
2901280	2903280	I'm sorry, they went through
2903280	2910280	Them taking it seriously is one thing that I've seen with the people that take the onion thing
2910280	2914280	But yeah, that blows my mind the idea of like, get her fired
2914280	2919280	Because then reducters will be all cleaned up for me
2920280	2924280	But it's really just about punishing this woman from
2924280	2926280	You should fire her
2926280	2930280	It's like trying to, imagine trying to get someone fired from the Ku Klux Klan
2930280	2933280	It's like, yeah, you're like
2933280	2935280	Sure it happens
2936280	2938280	I mean, show up dirty
2940280	2947280	Someone wrote like a thousand word blog post just to articulate the fact that Alaska is in the United States
2947280	2949280	That was a sex robot moment
2949280	2953280	Like you really felt superior to this fictional writer
2953280	2955280	So if everybody's just dumb
2955280	2958280	Now this is just broadening out into like, okay
2958280	2959280	I think we all agree, yeah
2959280	2961280	Like most people are dumb
2961280	2963280	The average IQ is 100
2963280	2967280	America has perhaps heroically, perhaps villainously
2967280	2970280	Spent its time on top
2970280	2973280	Reallocating assets
2973280	2978280	Slowly from the future educated children
2978280	2982280	Like, we've been focusing on dumbness
2982280	2984280	Like in horse sense
2984280	2985280	We're like, oh, we're cowboys
2985280	2988280	And we're gonna rustle the doggies of the world
2988280	2993280	And like, who needs to care if evolution is real in order for that to happen
2993280	2996280	You just need a lasso and a bomb
2996280	3007280	And like, so it's like, I guess as young comedy people who have no choice but to be thinking about a wish for the world
3007280	3014280	Because you're not jaded, nihilistic troll people who are just going like, fuck you, you're stupid
3014280	3016280	The world is stupid
3016280	3022280	Do you guys, like, is there a goal? Are we supposed to just make dumb people smart with comedy?
3022280	3026280	Are we supposed to just try to avoid getting shot?
3026280	3033280	Are we supposed to shift things so that 60 years from now in a world we don't get to participate in, things are better?
3033280	3036280	Am I overreacting to...
3036280	3040280	I think we have to dumb down our message for them in a way
3040280	3042280	Simplify, we need to simplify
3042280	3047280	Speaking to your point of taking Trump down at all costs, similar to George Bush in 10 years
3047280	3051280	All these people are gonna pretend that they hated Trump and they're gonna pretend they didn't vote for him
3051280	3056280	So my goal is not to take down Donald Trump and convince them he has a tiny penis
3056280	3064280	The goal, I think, is to shift their focus and be like, hey, healthcare is good, black people deserve to live
3064280	3066280	Just focus
3066280	3067280	Hilarious
3067280	3071280	Slow down, slow down
3071280	3076280	Let's take it one step at a time
3076280	3084280	And if you give us comedy tips, if I'm a satirical journalist and I'm like, I want to do a bit
3084280	3086280	Because you can see it misfiring a lot
3086280	3094280	People think that satire means a lot of times just pretty much non-ironic kind of sarcasm
3094280	3099280	Which creates a sarcasm that you're trying to...
3099280	3111280	But there's an art, there's a real art to leading people around to an absurd thought that forces them to realize something like black people deserve healthcare
3111280	3120280	But you don't do it by typing an article that says, black people don't deserve healthcare, get it?
3120280	3124280	Again, I don't know why I'm explaining this to you
3124280	3130280	My question is, do you have any little tips, like a fundamental philosophical kind of tip
3130280	3136280	Where I'm trying to think of an example from another field where it's like if a welder were to say
3136280	3141280	Or if a football quarterback were to say, follow through
3141280	3149280	Or just some simple thing when it comes to parody and stuff where you're actually hoping that the end result will be somebody laughing
3149280	3162280	And then also looking at themselves as a kind of guiding principle that separates the craftsman from the non-crafts people
3162280	3169280	I mean, this might seem really obvious saying it out loud, but that your headline actually says what you are trying to say
3169280	3174280	Like if you're like, okay, what's the joke of this piece? And you're like, well, I think it's this and this and this
3174280	3178280	And if that's not actually reflected in the headline, then you wouldn't believe how many times that happens
3178280	3187280	Is that it? Wait, I'm not sure if you're citing a, give me an example or clarify more because I'm not sure if you're sorry
3187280	3190280	I just opened a Pandora's box. I don't know
3190280	3196280	So when the headline is super funny, it's a joke, but it doesn't relate to any of the article. The article can't back it up
3196280	3197280	So you sort of lose steam
3197280	3201280	So do you mean the headline kind of encapsulates the whole bit right there, right?
3201280	3207280	Or do you, but I thought you might have been saying like, actually the headline shouldn't even be ironic or it should be
3208280	3213280	I don't know. The whole joke is there in the headline. There's no like buried lead basically
3213280	3218280	Like what, what you're agreeing to click on is what you're going to get in that article
3218280	3223280	Unlike a lot of mainstream journalism, which currently is like, what will people click on in this headline?
3223280	3226280	Let's pick one random phrase from this article
3226280	3231280	How much are you, when you guys write something that's like obviously satirical or parodic that
3231280	3235280	Are you writing and hoping because like satire is not for everybody
3235280	3239280	And people don't know that a lot like you're joking when you say I'm moving to Alaska
3239280	3244280	That, that, that's, that's the whole joke is in the headline there. Like that's, that's all there
3244280	3250280	Are you writing for how, what percent are you hoping that stupid people bite on that
3250280	3255280	And write crazy blog posts and are inflamed by that
3255280	3259280	Or are you hoping that everybody gets the joke and it's hilarious across the board
3259280	3262280	We never write for the dum dums
3262280	3265280	We're not trying to change anyone's mind
3265280	3272280	It's usually, we're usually trying to guilt and shame the well-intentioned liberals who are not actually fixing the problem
3272280	3275280	So like we'll do things like these headlines
3277280	3278280	I love that
3278280	3280280	So you mean all of San Francisco
3282280	3288280	Like we'll do a headline that's like these headlines about Black Lives Matter are breaking my heart as I scroll past them
3289280	3295280	And it just sort of is like a lot of them are like hey white women you're not helping
3295280	3296280	Right, right, right
3296280	3300280	Or like I can't believe this country is so racist says employee of all white startup
3304280	3309280	And I mean like I think even in that one was a tweak where we're never, we try to avoid making
3311280	3317280	You know talking about like a big rich white man because I think like anyone in this room can like point at a white rich CEO
3317280	3318280	And be like that guy sucks
3318280	3322280	We try to kind of get it a little more specific and that specificity kind of
3322280	3326280	Makes us all turn inward and look at ourselves a little bit more
3327280	3329280	We all have a little rich white man inside of us
3329280	3330280	We do
3331280	3332280	That's cool
3332280	3334280	That guy is just not profitable
3337280	3338280	I have one every night
3341280	3343280	His name is Dan Harmon
3343280	3350280	I actually do as a side note when you guys when you guys do encounter that thing where it's like somebody even as individuals
3350280	3356280	Or as reductress, but but like I know is when you encounter the situation where you accidentally
3357280	3363280	Snared somebody like what you're like just doing something that was like ironic and somebody does go
3364280	3368280	Like that makes you feel bad doesn't it or not to lead you but it makes me feel bad
3369280	3371280	I feel like I fucked up or something
3371280	3377280	Sometimes it's like too true for people and you're like, I don't know like did I want to hurt this person?
3378280	3382280	I love that some dude is sitting in his apartment like why you pick on me, you know I don't
3387280	3394280	I kind of feel that way sometimes I feel like I feel like I feel like we've come as close as we've ever come in this last election
3394280	3401280	where like like like a lot of people are saying like like oh well in a world where we
3402280	3404280	Some of us experience shame for not being
3405280	3411280	Society's ideal of beautiful that some people are saying this is not my speech about we ignored the Rust Belt
3411280	3415280	I fuck it. Fuck them. I'm from Wisconsin. Fuck that part of me
3417280	3421280	I'm just like like like that that I've had conversations with
3421280	3429280	who I thought were smart friends of mine that that like we're like, yeah, but I'd rather him than Hillary
3430280	3437280	You go down this road and like you always come down to this like little channel that's filled with like little rats and bits of newspaper
3438280	3441280	But there's like this fundamental almost
3442280	3450280	Shagrining honesty about how it's an anti and intellectual revolution that that that all of this like that shaming people about
3451280	3457280	punctuation and not understanding the world and things like that that that that's like that
3458280	3464280	What is my point? It's only the it's only an observation. It's not about it. We didn't do fucking shit wrong. We're good people
3464280	3466280	I'm not saying that at all. That's not my thesis
3466280	3472280	I just like I think it's an interesting observation that we've come we've come as far as we ever have in our life of a group of
3472280	3479280	Americans saying like I've been feeling dumb because I'm dumb for a long time and I was just hoping maybe dumb people could be in control
3479280	3484880	And like they're like like like like like they dressed that up when bush with the bush thing
3484880	3489640	They used to dress that up and that they're getting closer and closer to just going dumb dumb dumb dumb
3489640	3495640	I read this article that was pretty interesting. That was about how the Trump
3496360	3498360	election is kind of similar to
3499160	3501920	insane clown posse followers to juggalos
3502920	3504920	Where they've created this
3505000	3510600	Community that basically exists to say fuck you to anything that would say fuck you to my community
3510600	3519000	right and so in doing in so doing they've kind of created this armor where it's like anything can be used to then justify their
3519000	3525680	Own their own means because their whole premise was just out of anger and you know resentment of just you know
3525680	3530100	Almost the same kind of things that we have angry resentment for but just other things
3531960	3538120	The municipal communities places in port cities places the nerve centers of the giant animal called the country
3538720	3542040	That are often dismissed and don't have electoral power
3542800	3547480	Because they're city slickers like they're folded over on themselves
3548120	3552760	Eight times which is the maximum and so they're all in contact with each other in a big sandwich
3552800	3559440	So even if they do have a low IQ they have they have a they have a snobbish ness to them when it comes to
3559560	3563240	What you say to an Indian man when you meet him at the deli
3564480	3570520	Where and then you're in these other states where the electoral power is so high and the positive way of looking at it
3570520	3573000	Isn't so much like oh, they're trying to take over there
3573000	3578680	They wish that the whole country was was a was a cattle ranch or a or a or a welding
3579560	3581760	Factory where you make welding
3583440	3587080	That what they're actually saying is oh first fold
3587960	3593480	Weird we're like we're out of the eighth fold and they're like, it's weird to be folded
3594000	3598080	Because the internet folded them. So they're having their first experiences with
3598680	3604840	With like with things that you learn if you like if you go to college
3607280	3614120	In a big city if you if you go from the Midwest to the next to the nearest big city and you
3614680	3616680	As you follow that path you
3617640	3623840	If I could just show you a Albert Brooks defending your life montage of of how dumb I've been
3623840	3630000	And how how the dumb things are like like like it didn't stop five minutes ago in the green room
3630000	3634440	I'm just like like meeting you guys. I'm just babbling. I'm just like trying to prove a good person
3634440	3642000	It's like you imagine like the shame of being a just a dumb shit. Just a big dumb shit bucket eating fucking moron
3642920	3650400	From a fucking town full of 800 fucking fucking idiot. He eats the shit bucket. He doesn't even have the shit
3650400	3652400	He eats the whole bucket
3652720	3656040	There's a shame there. I think I think shame is like our biggest problem
3656040	3661640	I think it's like it's white fragility and male fragility in a nutshell because it's like when you tell someone like hey
3661640	3666840	The thing you guys always do hurts me as a person. They experience a tiny fraction of that pain
3666840	3672280	They're like, oh I hurt someone. Well the part well the part that I just heard was the thing you guys always do
3673280	3679000	And I was like processing and I was like fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Well, you're telling me that it hurts you
3679680	3685280	In a lot of instances, you're like, hey the thing you do kills us and then they're like that hurts our feelings for you to say
3685280	3692000	That you know and you're like, but but on our side, that's a little bit bigger, you know microcosm is every
3692920	3694600	relationship
3694600	3701200	Where because I just had one tonight where it's like I didn't have a fight with my girlfriend, but we had a thing
3701200	3707040	It's like like we love each other so much that any turbulence causes a conversation of
3709080	3712520	Like if someone were to express a need if someone were to say oh
3712800	3720280	I'm dissatisfied in this area if when I hear that unless I'm fucking on point and sober and ready for anything
3720280	3723400	And I've just finished breathing four times taking four second breaths
3723720	3726320	And I have a big mouthful of peanut butter and I got a
3727680	3730640	Sheep on my dick. I don't know what what what my idea
3730640	3736280	I'm in a hammock or like like like I whatever the ideal is like unless those ideal situations are right. I'm
3736920	3738920	bound to hear
3738960	3740360	your
3740360	3742280	dissatisfaction as I
3742280	3744280	Fucked up I fucked up now
3744400	3749000	Like it's easy to when you look back on it after your autonomic system like cools down
3749080	3754120	We always look back and go oh that person told me I fucked up like and and wow
3754120	3758120	they must really give a fuck it like like to tell me that and
3758640	3765240	Also, my ability to say I fucked up is actually like pretty cool sexy alpha like like
3766480	3771880	Like but in that moment you're like, I'm always like like I didn't fuck up
3771880	3774680	I didn't fuck up like like you should know what okay
3774680	3778240	Maybe I did fuck up, but that definitely pales in comparison to your fuckups
3778240	3782160	I like like would you even just telling me I fucked up is kind of a fuckup if you think about it
3783000	3788560	There's just this like scramble and it's a panic that is equivalent to when you when you're drowning
3788560	3794680	It's fight-or-flight and there's something romantic about that because what you're feeling fight or fight. Don't shake your head Brandon
3796560	3801760	At the heart of it at the heart of it all is like your why would you pan?
3801920	3808800	It's like like if you watch like a more movie about Nazis about like they're hurting people into a camp
3809120	3815280	There's not a ton of like ow my shoes hurt. What the fuck are you saying that for? I'm a fucking good Nazi
3816600	3820240	They're like not hearing them and not looking at them as humans
3820240	3824120	and there's like there is a place you can get to where hatred and and
3824720	3828700	Privilege and all of the things that we're struggling with like get to a place where it's like, holy shit
3828700	3833100	It's really bad and right now for it to be in a place of people
3833580	3840420	Freaking out all the time like like like that the fact that the internet is a goddamn fucking like cesspool is because
3841220	3842380	like we're
3842380	3848460	Like we're getting hurt by each other and half of us were 20% of us or whatever getting hurt by the idea that we've been
3848460	3852700	Doing it wrong the whole time and we're just gonna make you happy. Yes, my world I made for you ladies
3852700	3855780	I think a lot of us have an impulse to be like hey
3855780	3858780	I didn't mean to do that and we really want to prove it to them
3858780	3861260	But it's like I didn't mean for you to call me a slut
3861260	3866180	I just wanted you to know I was like wanted a fair wages
3866180	3870320	I think the fact that someone the fact that someone would bring the point up to you like is
3870340	3874860	Them knowing that you didn't mean to like they already know that so we get caught in this trap
3874860	3878180	But you have to prove to them that like we're a good person who wouldn't intentionally hurt them
3878180	3882780	It's like that's beside the point to them. Yeah, they're just trying to tell you to stop doing it
3882780	3889260	And it's hard because it it every human being shares this I think prima to logical
3890060	3892060	there is a
3892420	3894260	surf curl or a
3894260	3896900	wind that gets in your sail the moment when you it's
3897500	3900420	Self-righteousness or just not even self-righteousness that sounds pejorative
3901260	3903260	Righteousness when you truly are right
3903980	3909460	It's not fabricated that you are right like that's when we a lot of us break down. I
3910460	3913740	My heroes are people the people that have changed me
3915380	3923140	Are people who have been right and have taken mercy on me and been like hey man like like you should know you're wrong
3923140	3927700	And I'm right, but like that they like come in somehow lower
3927700	3931540	It's I don't know. I don't even know how they did it, but like I've had these experiences where I'm like I
3932100	3939100	would have just argued about this shit and like been this way if it weren't for this one person this anonymous person on Twitter or
3939500	3943860	It's some some some flame war that was like it's 9-11 everybody
3947020	3954540	Anyways, but but but yeah, it's it's it's but it's a it's a dangerous mechanism in all of us that we I think when we feel
3956100	3959300	When we feel correct when we feel right we
3960460	3969020	there's like a Newtonian law there that like puffs us up more and then and then it creates this syndrome because when you feel wrong you
3969020	3972820	Have a you have a defensive reaction, and then when you feel right you have an aggressive reaction
3973380	3975860	Maybe that's me describing men. I don't think so though
3975860	3983460	I I have a theory now that we've all been emotionally abused by probably our parents or someone I like that theory and then
3984060	3985140	our
3985140	3991060	Our coping mechanism going forward is like it's either fight or flight so in certain situations
3991060	3996220	We just become the abuser because we're like I'm the right one here. You know where it's a way of taking control
3996460	4003060	I think a chaotic household which should describe 100% of households even if you think you lived in a beaver cleaver like household
4003060	4005020	I think you're a kid, so it's chaotic
4005020	4009980	I do think it's like you have these like tyrants who are gonna say because I said so and they're gonna be like
4009980	4014300	And I think the moments that we that dopamine spike us and evolve us are the moments
4014300	4018260	We stand up to them and prove them wrong. I at least I should just be for myself
4018260	4021820	I mean that was my household. It's like I don't I didn't learn
4021820	4027580	I didn't like like learn that the more I could roll over the more
4027940	4032620	Freedom I got at all like my curfews got extended by fucking monologues
4032820	4039540	like like like my my my posture improved like every like it was like all my
4039620	4046320	Leveling up what had to do with like the moment. I finally lost my shit and fucking like proved someone wrong
4047260	4050540	Emulating what they the weapons they would use against me which were like
4051140	4052820	yelling and shaming and
4052820	4059980	Toxifying and all that stuff and it's that's the that's the I guess that's what we're all up against is because our whole species is
4060060	4066220	Descended from a one big dysfunctional family that was reproductively successful like we don't give ourselves enough credit
4066780	4074220	Biologically for being primate that grew up in God's crosshairs and yet beat the fuck out of giraffes and ants
4075220	4081700	We're going to the fucking outer space and and and and when we do if you were a good giraffe you can come with
4081700	4083700	We'll think about it
4084060	4089540	It was not a good solution to grow a longer neck because you couldn't reach leaves. It's dumb
4090620	4095940	You thought you nailed it. You would have fucking eaten us if you had evolved past that you would have fucking eaten us
4095940	4097500	We're eating you
4097500	4099980	You don't even taste good. You just got you're all neck
4100260	4102260	And
4102380	4106620	You can't talk you get famous for their necks can't talk
4107900	4113620	You hate you hate giraffes so much somewhere along the line or where I'm growing a longer neck
4113620	4116180	Maybe I should add some larynx is
4117020	4121460	So I could say hey anyone have any ideas about how to build a ladder
4121460	4123460	We
4127060	4129060	What my point is
4129140	4131220	We didn't we don't earn this through our
4132180	4136340	Metagrass we've been in the company of one don't interrupt me it irritates me
4138220	4143380	We we didn't earn any of this, but it also is recognized
4143380	4150740	It was like like as a species we fucking like we we are the biggest success on the planet
4150980	4156620	until you get to the part where we're so successful that the planet made then fail, but like as
4157180	4159260	Individual human beings then we don't
4160100	4163860	Fuck I had it. I fucking had it. I had the meaning of life right in my fucking hand
4164980	4168500	God damn it. I want my tail back if we're so successful
4170140	4175460	We lost tails because we got so big and fat because we were like fucking nailing it we used to be like squirrels
4175460	4180620	I mean if you just if you back us up all the way to assuming we all came from one amoeba
4180780	4186820	We represent the part of that amoeba's family that was like peace like we're awesome
4187340	4192660	See and all the other fucking amoeba siblings are like no. I think I'll be an amoeba the
4193340	4197820	Grows a amoeba shirt, and we were like I think I'll be a fucking monkey
4198580	4201020	And they're like you think you're better than me now
4203820	4210100	I don't want that toe thumb. You can fucking grab that grab on the shit with your foot. Yeah, and super strength
4210140	4216540	Yeah, fucking yeah, remember that see you just fucking hang out upside down. I'm fine like this. Oh, yeah, like we had one
4216540	4220500	Here's what it doesn't protect you from your cousin's becoming nuclear capable
4223500	4225500	Sorry tow thumb
4226900	4234420	I've got why are those mutually inclusive? Why can't I be good at nuclear physics and also have a tow thumb turn turns out?
4234420	4236420	you can't I
4236420	4243100	If we don't blow ourselves up we may get to a point where we can upload our consciousness into a simulation of having tow thumbs
4243100	4245260	Like we're almost there. We're almost there
4246300	4250200	We just kind of we just got a couple more little conniption fits to get through
4251500	4254380	God, I really I swear to God I had a fucking point
4254380	4258220	I was gonna stitch the giraffe thing to the fuck to a thing it was gonna blow your mind
4258780	4264020	You're mad about giraffes because they got it wrong, and they should have had a ladder. Yeah, and why I know that
4264740	4267540	About the ladder part that part was great
4268660	4272860	Now what I was saying before that was it was harping about something
4272860	4277020	I was like like then I got off on this thing that I'm like I've said a thousand times, but I was like
4277580	4278980	alright, so
4278980	4284020	We should build a wall. We should build a wall. Did you see the photo of the guy and that's the wall?
4284020	4286020	All right anyways the
4286780	4289580	You're gonna want those giraffes in the wall when the wall happens man
4290220	4293460	Cuz you know you're gonna need someone if I can see what's going on the other side
4294020	4304580	You're gonna fucking eat your fucking words about giraffes
4306380	4312500	You remember gladiator they get that they have a shot whether you can see your giraffes like being like loaded into the
4312620	4316140	Coliseum's loading dock, but they don't have the scene where people are like killing giraffes
4316140	4320420	Which is what they used to do because they were like holy shit look at these monsters with long necks
4320420	4323140	We should we should have eight of them fight dug
4325020	4331660	And Doug would be like yeah, yeah, and the giraffes would be like are you fucking kidding me I?
4332220	4337420	Got a long neck here. I did everything. I'm supposed to do. I'm not a horse for God's sake
4337420	4343060	I got a long neck and we're like we have bronze you're dead, and it's not fair
4343060	4346260	Yeah, giraffe will fuck you up a kick you the fucking wap you with her head
4346260	4351940	They don't fuck about you know you don't want to fight you don't want to fight a zebra a zebra will fucking get you look
4351940	4354980	Everything will get me a giraffe would kick my ass. I'm not a gladiator I
4356980	4360460	Wouldn't want to be in a ring with it with a giraffe even even with a sword
4360460	4363540	I was I would like that. He's gonna walk on your face. I don't
4364460	4367260	What do you want to be in a ring with a sword with?
4369140	4371140	Crocket just say
4372140	4379460	If you had said a female a feminist parody news news site editors
4380100	4384940	Why would I say that because our because our podcast would have taken a huge turn for like clicks?
4385540	4389220	But amazing if I said I wanted to kill feminists gotten you a wooden sword
4389220	4392020	We would have like gone it didn't do it would have been like a huge charity event
4392020	4396580	Here's what I would do if I could go back in time if I could be in a ring with anybody and it was an actual
4396580	4403060	Sword Nero who used to make it people fighting with fake swords like don't fight me with a real sword you piece of shit
4404060	4406060	What I want so you want?
4406100	4408100	What about an ugly sex robot?
4409460	4414380	I would I would fuck a sex robot. It looked like David Lee Roth. You're just
4415620	4417620	just just because
4426740	4430980	You came on my face I would do it just for that
4432780	4434980	If it was just like a soundboard like a ways
4435980	4440140	Oh, you had a shack one where it's like what would you scum?
4440980	4442980	ease the seat back
4445020	4447180	My friend Matt Young thought the lyrics were I
4448740	4453900	Can barely see the road all the heat coming off it reach down between my legs ease the seed bag
4453900	4456740	Oh, no, he thought it was ease the seed bag
4457620	4461020	So David Lee Roth is a farmer on a tractor
4461980	4463980	Is the
4464660	4469300	Wave to Joshua I reached out between my legs and ease the seed bag
4469300	4473460	I was like you thought that was on the fucking air on the radio. That's the one
4473460	4475260	I showed you guys today for the longest time
4475260	4480620	I don't know when I figured out that it wasn't the case. I thought the phrase blow your wad was
4481660	4486060	Exclusively sexual and was so grossed out that mainstream media would just use it that
4486340	4492700	Like CNN would go like oh the Clinton campaign may have blown its wad on the thing. I'll be like gross. What are you?
4493580	4500180	Talking about jipe on a second it like what and then I realized it's like oh, it's like a wad of cash or I
4501420	4506140	Didn't I I I was like, how are people saying blow your wad all the time?
4506900	4512300	So gross. It's like Pearl Jam and you can learn what Pearl Jam is and you're like gross. Stop it. What do you ate?
4513020	4516500	That's why I hear your name all the time. Wait, what the fuck?
4517300	4521780	Pearl Jam is what is no that's pearl necklace. Not that I know. Well, it's no well
4521780	4529300	No, I gestured to my decolletage, but I I don't know that's even it's even grosser Pearl Jam
4529300	4531620	It's fucking yeah, Pearl Jam gross
4531620	4537100	You mean somebody takes cum and puts it in a jar and makes jam is that an act?
4537100	4542860	No, it's a way of referring to your fucking gross pearly cum. Is that an actual thing? Are you a sorry?
4543820	4545820	They don't like it
4546180	4548180	It's all bed
4550380	4552480	Check this motherfucker for a suicide vest
4556220	4558660	Don't you never stand up in a comedy show like that
4560420	4566740	Check him for a vest. Is that a bed? Yeah, please don't kill us. All right. Thank you
4567100	4570940	Thank you for saving Pearl Jam for everyone in this room. You thought
4571540	4577620	Come reference. I did. I really maybe I projected that did I come up with a name for cum and like make it Pearl Jam's fault
4577620	4584500	I think you did. All right, I accept that I mean, I was like, what the fuck do I not know about?
4585420	4587580	You would never spread Pearl Jam on toast
4589420	4593500	Well, I'm not ashamed of that projection that just makes me imagine it of like Vonnegut or something
4593580	4598340	I didn't like I didn't like market it like but I do the important thing is but thank you
4598340	4602460	You Pearl Jam if you're listening, you're you're off the hook
4604340	4609340	That ant story to me sounds like something they just said in interviews in the 90s. What was the answer?
4609340	4614260	I wasn't even listening. All I heard was that their aunt Pearl made good really good jam. Oh
4618060	4623100	Okay, so all right, yeah, you're right they made that up so they could explain their name in interviews
4624100	4630620	Yeah, that's all right. Also. Yeah, like the Beatles said they were losing this guy with diamonds wasn't LSD. Yeah some other show
4631260	4633260	Limp just made really good biscuits
4638140	4641820	Wait, what is limp biscuit mean? Is that a reference to something sexual?
4654380	4660020	I don't understand how the ordinary world in that Campbellian journal journey is a bunch of people jerking off on a biscuit
4660740	4663700	I had to make up a phrase for when that fails
4663860	4668860	Yeah, it seems like if everybody successfully jerked off on a biscuit the biscuit would become limp
4670180	4672780	But you're saying that the guy that can't keep it up
4674460	4677060	He's a winner there are no winners
4680300	4682300	He's got to eat the biscuit
4682380	4686500	You know you don't get great in that biscuit a little a little might have my aunt's pearl gem I
4687580	4692260	Always thought limp biscuit is the worst thing you could hear right before a dude punches you in the mouth
4693700	4697500	That's how you know, you're about to get into a fight now when a white dude is like
4699980	4701980	You're like no
4704020	4711380	So fucking embarrassed I don't want to hear limp biscuit or smash mouth under any circumstances right right. I'd rather have my ass beat to journey

5221420	5224260	Except that is the answer. Oh shit. Yeah, okay
5226740	5232740	Okay, it's about that that time the time that I'm getting nervous so that we don't have an ending
5235140	5237140	So I'll literally change the pitch of my voice
5239340	5246860	That's awesome, why do I allow myself to take on a slight urban patois as long as it's being filtered through a base enhancing a device I
5248460	5250460	Want to call myself out on that
5252380	5255780	Do you have any did do any do any way people have
5256060	5260900	white friends that when they talk to any black person like they
5261300	5265660	Uncontrollably affect a little slight like like kind of like urban like you talk about
5267460	5270580	Hey, and it doesn't matter who they are like it doesn't matter what like
5271780	5275460	They just like they just like their friends even to go
5276660	5281500	And I always like I always like I have such social anxiety. I'm like, I'm like, oh my god, what are you doing?
5281500	5284140	Stop, what are you doing? We love it. Everybody should do it
5285060	5287860	Really? It's a natural thing that every person does with you speaking
5288860	5293460	Yeah, it's the way you say I'm hearing you I agree with you
5293460	5298460	I want to be on good terms with you because if you start a hard army when I'm like chillin with you

5304540	5308620	We were talking about blunts and shit and you never were like, yeah, you always like yes
5309340	5314020	That's right. So I think it's a I think it's a good thing. Maybe I think it's you trying to reach out
5315020	5321420	That agreement is how we learn language is how we mimic each other because it's how we we socially agree with each other
5321420	5323580	Well, here's what I try to do when I talk to African-Americans
5331860	5339420	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I try to be my

5463120	5465120	300 BC
5465120	5467120	I invented
5480840	5485960	We probably shouldn't have a phobia of finishing a show before 10 p.m. We should probably at those moments
5485960	5489700	We should be like, all right. Sorry ladies about that last. I don't know if it
5490300	5496140	It occurred to me if you'd never heard the show before you'd be like, are they doing this to like go to us?
5499380	5504460	We didn't give us a chance to freestyle you guys you want to you want to jump in on some of this shit. Yes
5505740	5506900	mandatory
5506900	5509980	It's what mandatory Beth is hungry
5512300	5514300	Dustin put a beat on before you get Pete on
5515740	5518980	Y'all heard of salt and pepper. This is turmeric and ginger
5519700	5521700	Ooh

5539700	5545700	It's like I'm spicy more like I'm very very nicely because I come in and shake your mom's hand
5545700	5549700	But it's got semen all over it because God knows what I've been doing
5553700	5555700	Shammy dick
5557700	5559700	Soft enough to wash a car
5559700	5565700	Soft enough to be wherever you are. I want your body. I want it for breakfast and lunch
5569700	5571700	Sorry to interrupt
5575700	5577700	Oh
5584020	5586020	It's just
5588980	5596220	Nobody wants to freestyle to this shit, but I guess I'm gonna have to do it because it is a great beat
5596220	5599420	I have to say I want to wash it like a car
5599420	5605900	It's gonna cost me a lot of money like a Tammy Toyota Camry a very good car
5605900	5608420	It doesn't take me very far, but it's reliable
5620220	5627380	Sometimes when I make love I need that shammy. I need someone to wipe down my dick after I drop my pearl jammy
5630420	5632420	Girl can I get your Camry?
5637420	5641380	My blue book rating is pretty high where we sell value is pretty pretty good
5647860	5653020	The sex robot of cars wipe me down with your judgmental
5659420	5665620	I'm gonna put a big lamb condom over your Tesla cuz that's the only way that I'll get you pregnant
5689420	5692560	Because it's like a shoe you're supposed to stop in it
5693300	5698300	Supposed to collect mud and dirt because if you're with a car, that's what a car is worth
5698300	5702420	I'm gonna get a BMW drive it in your booty
5706140	5708140	If you're given to
5708300	5710300	hysteria
5715820	5717820	I'm a misogynist car
5719420	5724260	I got a boner and my car is my boner. I'm an owner
5733100	5735100	So heavy
5749420	5751420	In a prison
5779420	5794140	MC misshapen dick everybody MC misshapen dick MC chammy dick
5796500	5798420	All right
5798420	5803100	DJ Camry, how do we how do we end our shows before 10 p.m. What do we do?
5803100	5806020	We just do I think we just slowly trail off into madness
5806020	5808020	I
5808220	5810420	Mean if it's not with a is there
5812140	5814460	We have to be improvised D&D and
5815180	5818580	We have to oh wait. Oh, let's do that. Okay, let's figure out
5818580	5822940	Okay, we gotta we gotta we gotta start doing role-playing. Let's just make this official business
5822940	5825940	Like we're gonna figure out like can we should we do should we do?
5826860	5830140	Shadow run again, or should we find a new thing? That's technically not
5830620	5832120	Whatever you guys want, man
5832120	5837300	What are they keep you cuz Dan and I were talking about doing like our role-playing games got kind of
5837460	5843020	Diffused because we would play it and there'd be seven characters and sometimes none of them were here and we would never remember
5843020	5844180	What the hell was going on?
5844180	5849260	So we're talking about going back to kind of the old days of like Sharpie and quark and Spencer
5849740	5851740	where it's
5851980	5857460	Maybe not end the show like do like a mid-show segment where the three of us play a little RPG
5857540	5860020	Drunk that we have no idea what's going on exactly
5860020	5860460	Yeah
5860460	5867420	But but we have a little legal maybe trouble with because of Harman quest a way to be the safest of anything if it's just
5868020	5871340	If it's not oh, that's an excellent point actually
5876060	5879740	Electric boogaloo. Yeah. Yeah one of the break answers from beat Street. Oh
5880660	5882900	Yeah, he's being sarcastic. It's
5883460	5884660	Yeah
5884660	5886180	Weird weird to yell that out
5886180	5892180	But also don't don't want to say weird because weird could have positive connotations like dumb dumb to yell that out
5900660	5906740	I mean that cadence says only one thing boxed wine. Yeah
5906740	5908740	I
5911700	5916940	Somebody please take her box of wine away from her. I mean I'm here to vote
5918380	5923260	Say dumb dumb to yell that out, but weird to defend it. No, which is which is a positive
5926540	5929100	Defending it. I think the person that yelled it out was dumb
5929940	5933980	She's kind of Joan of Arc for going like fuck it. He deserves to live
5934900	5939260	I'm like, yeah, she's she's right. I don't think they're even sitting next to each other
5939260	5943220	I hope electric boogaloo and wine box lady get the fucking get it on the night
5945300	5951220	But I hope that she keeps talking to him that way you don't have time you can take me home
5953300	5956060	We should get each other's number
5957100	5962460	And he comes home every night from a day of frustration. He's like I just keep yelling out electric boogaloo
5963020	5965260	And no one gets me and she's like
5966500	5967500	Yeah, yeah
5967500	5974420	You deserve to yell it out and he's like, I love you and she's like, let's get something beyond bath salts. I
5977140	5980200	Don't want to just eat the face I want to eat the soul
5982500	5986500	Let's bring Florida to Los Angeles, that's why we moved here

6032620	6035420	Love she backfired exciting
6037140	6039140	Fucker got gutsy, but it black fired
6040940	6047620	I'm like the Brad Pitt right like in that metaphor like I like I come with my beard and I'm like helping you build shit
6047620	6051900	And I'm like, I don't get it. Tell me explain slavery to me. I don't get it. I don't get it
6053020	6056860	We're gonna get you out of here. You would certainly be the slave owner
6059540	6065020	It's not true, although I do feel like my mom I remember my mom you have two assistants when we were
6069020	6076100	Just because I take to ownership well does it mean that I'm like like like that's that's different
6077580	6081540	But I do feel like there was a constant thing when I was growing up in Milwaukee where there was
6081820	6086420	There were people that would call our house like cold calling to round up
6086860	6090940	Family reunions and there would always be this awkward moment where the person calling would be like
6091380	6096140	Yes, the Harmon family is getting together in the park and my mom would be like, okay. Well, where should we go?
6096820	6103260	Anybody? Well, we're meeting by the water fountain. Um, forgive me for asking, but are you white?
6103780	6107860	And my mom would go. Yes, we are and he'd go. Well, we're we aren't
6108380	6110700	And then my mom would get off the phone and go
6111300	6113700	I think someone in our family owned slaves
6115180	6118620	Not we should go to that nice black family's party
6120700	6125020	They did that convert that phone call disinvited us the guy was like very
6125820	6131940	He'd be like you're not invited. That is not fucking true. No, you black people you you're exclusionary
6136660	6139060	Johnson we party with everybody
6141180	6147300	Good god the black Swedes if somebody's fucking says Johnson I shows up for the free food
6147300	6153060	I'm not stupid you should you should have fucking shown up these motherfuckers be like we're the richest Harmans
6153060	6157260	And we have the greatest restaurants, but that white family won't show up to our barbecue
6159140	6162620	Well, we should have gone I didn't have a say in that family I would have gone
6163420	6164820	Dan I
6164820	6167340	Should have I should have I made you my mistake
6167340	6172060	You said you made monologues and that made change you could have stood up. I should have made one of my monologues
6172060	6174820	Let's go party with black people. I didn't do it. I
6175500	6178820	Had well, it's not too late. Bring out Reginald Harmon
6188380	6191060	He's like Dan I'm the one who supplied your rap beat
6193180	6195180	Show me no familiar love Dan
6198340	6200340	Yeah, am I still your favorite?
6203380	6206700	Nope, I know more cuz I got your ass. You don't like me no more do you?
6212460	6216020	Honey what oh now it's we okay
6217220	6221780	It's it's as a timing is it's hard. It's like a thing that you learn. It's like it's like it's like
6222340	6226780	It's like with ice skating. It's like oh you have blades on your feet and it's slippery out there
6226780	6229160	I've done both of these things and you just go out and it's just like
6232020	6235320	And it happens to us to primarily when people are just like
6240060	6247260	Are they are the only people that get through are the people sort of so blind drunk that they're just like I killed Kurt Cobain
6249580	6253100	And we and we welcome them all and we want them all to come up on stage and
6253380	6258220	And stuff, but then there's this Jerry Springer effect, and then I need I need to be a better ringmaster
6258220	6259780	I need to like crack the
6259780	6261780	crack the whip
6268700	6274180	Like a ringmaster ring master Jeff was right
6277020	6279300	He thinks he's the Brad Pitt in that movie
6279300	6281300	I
6281580	6287080	Want mustache away, man, I'd be like thank thank you kindly. Oh, hey, there's two by four

6293660	6296580	You know what I'm gonna talk to a guy who's gonna talk to a guy
6296580	6302060	I think I can get you signed with an agency that get you out of this out of this southern area
6303260	6308260	I'm from Sweden. I don't know what's going on. I just produced the movie
6309460	6311460	magical white man
6312340	6316740	Why am I throwing Brad Pitt out of the bus he tried to do trying to do a good thing?
6323260	6326900	I didn't hear it, but ooh, I didn't I didn't hear
6329620	6331780	You don't have to be a dick about it
6331780	6339580	All right, well, so what kind of weird Muppet show is happening in the back row right now
6340380	6342380	It could be like it could be
6345060	6347060	Francia
6347140	6352300	The French I don't even understand the inside jokes of the people that are mocking the drug that was a that was a he was doing
6352300	6354300	About that's box wine friends. Yeah
6354900	6356900	Oh
6357500	6359500	To you my friends, all right
6359540	6361020	That was yeah
6361020	6367420	That's that's where we loosen the reins enough for the hoi pollo to to ooze in and teach us that there's a reason why some
6367420	6368820	of us are
6368820	6370540	elitist and
6370540	6372540	That's why now we now we bring it back around
6372540	6377020	It's why Sarah and Beth are so lucky that you guys do your your show in the confines of a studio or you guys
6377020	6379020	You don't have to deal with everything. Oh
6380740	6382740	Yeah, we hate people
6384620	6387620	Have you guys ever done when you do when you do your live show?
6387620	6393700	Do you ever how loose are the how loose is the grip on people like chiming in and do you guys like?
6394500	6397260	You know, what are your feelings there? What's your philosophy?
6397820	6401820	People haven't chimed in at all. I don't know. I mean like our hosts are
6402540	6404660	nuts, so they kind of just like
6405060	6410660	Occupied the space and there really isn't a lot of room for people to get in there. We create our own crazy
6410780	6413620	Yeah, yeah, it's our particular brand
6415460	6417800	It was just verified from one of our producers
6418900	6424180	Kevin the woman that I jokingly said I did not know this I said she was drinking boxed wine
6424940	6426940	Apparently not only is that true
6427300	6431180	She's taken the bag out of the box and just drinking it out of out of
6432300	6438940	So my lard bag like a fucking doing it right like like like Daniel Boone like a bag
6441060	6444900	She's playing candy boy. I didn't know I was right about boxed wine
6444900	6449180	I thought I was just thought I was just being an asshole and turns out I was morally safer. It was fucking
6450700	6455220	All right, how do we how do we end the show how do we end a show how does anyone ever end a show?
6455220	6459380	I've never learned. How about one of your Andy Rooney moments where you you just break it down you?
6460380	6464180	Kind of give me a thing that I should decry box wine
6465460	6468500	Why is why is wine always coming in boxes?
6469300	6471300	No one knows who Andy Rooney is
6474580	6476900	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, son. Thank you
6480100	6482100	Do your Rachel Maddow
6483060	6487260	Give us a Rachel Maddow Keith Olbermann fucking like break down like oh
6487380	6492540	How do we feel about Keith Olbermann does anybody cuz I feel like he's not as popular as he should be like I love that
6492540	6496020	He's like sitting in a basement. Just like fucking calling out and just going like holy shit
6496500	6501580	Does it does he does he hit his wife or something like what why is it that everyone's not like Keith Olbermann is my
6501580	6504620	Jam, what is it? I'm never gonna forgive you for sports
6506100	6512660	Was that what really he went he was a sportscaster for a little while. Yeah, so what like nerds don't appreciate that shit
6512660	6517380	But he defected he defected. That's why I that's part of why I that's not cool
6518660	6522820	Cuz I cuz I looked at his Wikipedia. I was expecting to see like oh he you know
6522820	6528180	I don't know something that was like dirt that dirtied him just enough that he's like just sitting alone going like
6531180	6537540	But it didn't but the reason he got fired or he got suspended because he donated while he was working on his thing he donated
6538700	6542520	$2,400 to each of three democratic parties
6543380	6545460	And then it was a technical infraction
6545460	6551860	So he took a suspension and then after the suspension they just didn't renegotiate his contract and nobody really knows
6552100	6557160	That's all Wikipedia. I went there to going like I fully expected to hear that he like hit a kid with his car
6557740	6558900	so
6558900	6565900	He's his major failure is that he's not an intelligent lesbian. I think that's really what he's lacking
6566420	6568420	What do you mean by that?
6571900	6573900	There can only be one
6573900	6575900	And
6576140	6582540	Didn't like her brand is strong his she just says like awesome stand-up like she to hurl her whole show
6582540	6588220	She's she looks at the camera and just does like like extended stand-up bits. I I adore her
6588220	6590380	I have room in my life for both of them. I got
6590740	6594220	I'm not bragging when I say that I just didn't see them as yeah
6594220	6597780	Oh, I have to watch one or the other like I and and he looks like Sam the Eagle
6597780	6602900	So as I would think that I would think that he would have like a hardcore demographic
6602940	6609140	That would be like I'm I'm ashamed enough of my straight white male like alpha whatever alpha beta-ness that
6609580	6612340	That I I want to I I want to be ashamed of it
6612340	6615220	But at the same time he's just like this like he cuts that silhouette
6615220	6619940	So it's like you're you have permission to like him because he's going like I don't know. He's like I love Keith Olbermann
6619940	6626140	which is like he's like he's like sitting in a basement somewhere like doing webisodes for GQ and he's like the
6626380	6632660	He's like again. He just like does these webisodes and he's just like fucking like just like this hyper verbose like
6633300	6639240	hyperbolic like he's like the sky is falling and he ends every podcast by going resist and he holds up like a
6639620	6641620	Spock sign and I was like peace
6642420	6646540	He's like and his Twitter avatars him wrapped in a flag like Daniel D
6646540	6650780	Lewis and gangs of New York and like it's like he's like lost his mind
6650780	6655940	But in a good way because in a mad world only the matter sane like I just I just fucking want to marry him
6655940	6660380	Do you like him? He's he should do he should do a show with Sam the Eagle
6661220	6667980	You know what why don't you like Keith Olbermann? I think he comes off as kind of a blowhard, maybe that's my guess. I only
6670860	6676020	Only I only trust him in you so when I got in the car and I said, what do you think of Keith Olbermann?
6676020	6680060	You're like he's fine, and I was like I'm not gonna ask anything else because I don't want my heart broken
6680060	6684140	Oh, he's fine because if you told me he was met I would be like now. What do I do?
6684140	6686740	I don't know what to do. Can we talk about heartbreak? I went and had
6687740	6691420	Thai food across the street at toy before the show with my girlfriend
6691740	6696020	This is my fortune. We've talked about how forcing cookies like drop the ball
6696020	6701380	Yeah, you want to fucking be really bummed out. That's the guys your fortune easy shit fat
6704660	6707620	Here pass this down to down didn't read this out loud
6707620	6711900	I guess this is who I guess two fortunes in a row that were blank and that is
6712460	6715020	Existentially terrifying that's actually that's badass
6715380	6722820	This was my fortune. Are you fucking kidding? This is my fortune in my fortune cookie, and I wanted to punch Confucius in the dick
6723460	6726220	This is some fucking CBS bullshit
6726940	6729780	Your fortune is as sweet as a cookie
6731700	6734900	Are you fucking kidding me that made me real I
6735420	6738580	Was physically upset by that one that made me physically upset
6738580	6742500	That's just that's beyond lazy into like I thought that maybe they changed it from
6742620	6748860	fortunes into advice cookies because they're trying to avoid litigation, so they would just be like they used to say like duck or
6749420	6755980	Like like like you're gonna meet somebody today guaranteed and like maybe they like pulled back because people were like suing them
6755980	6759780	Or something and seven see this and 72 hours. You're gonna meet a foreigner with a knife
6759780	6763420	Yeah, like shit like that. I swear that used to be that way in the 70s. It would be
6764780	6767460	Yellow hat is gonna give you curious George
6767460	6769460	I
6774060	6776060	Waited forever for this
6777220	6784580	Do we both default to a horrible slack-jawed Valley girl when we hate people I waited forever
6785020	6788060	for that man and a yellow hat
6790300	6793460	But and then it'd be and then it just became like you'd open your fortune cookie
6793460	6798340	And it would be like it's better to be good than to be nice or something like I don't care what you think about how
6798340	6799300	to fucking run your life
6799300	6805700	I want to know what's gonna happen turn to beat the tapestry of fate you fucking Chinese cookie. I I
6806740	6811340	Broke the cookie. I did my job. You have to live up to your end of the fucking first
