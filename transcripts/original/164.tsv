0	29000	From Hollywood, California, Sunset Boulevard, Sunset Strip, Meltdown Comics and Nerdmelt Theatre, Harmon Town, it's now in session.
29000	39000	Let's bring out Spencer Crichton and our Game Master.
39000	51000	And just for good measure, let's bring out the good mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon!
51000	57000	Thank you. Thank you very, very much. You're always very kind, even though we keep doing this over and over again.
57000	63000	You guys keep reacting, so it's like they're happy every time.
63000	71000	I feel like this crowd is extra special happy tonight. There's something about this crowd.
71000	78000	There is an electricity and a free song in the air right now, and yet we say that all the time.
78000	84000	It's not always the exact same people, but they always fall for that too.
84000	88000	I feel like they must be smarter than last week's audience somehow.
88000	97000	I don't know if they're smarter. They're leaning farther downhill. They're ready for more of a free fall.
97000	103000	You guys are up for an adventure more than last week, I think, right?
103000	109000	I think you guys want to go on a bear hunt.
109000	117000	A lot of people are like, wait, what is that? Is that like a weird college thing?
117000	120000	Is that like a fratty, horrible thing?
120000	125000	We had a bear hunt, but it got cut out of the episode.
125000	130000	Yeah, yeah. So I imagine it exists somewhere.
130000	138000	The Harmon town extra, if you buy the platinum package or whatever and you get all the unedited cities,
138000	146000	if you go to the Nashville one, in my blackout blind drunk, I take the audience on a bear hunt,
146000	156000	which is a thing that we did in my daycare center that I remember at red carpet bowling lanes.
156000	163000	The parents would drop the kids off and then the kids would just roll around on linoleum and traumatize each other.
163000	168000	But then every once in a while, an old lady would say, let's go on a bear hunt.
168000	173000	And then after that, she'd go, okay, now you can go play with the toys.
173000	178000	And these three fastest kids would get to the dirty big wheel first.
178000	185000	I'd hide under a table. A girl put a crayon in my mouth.
186000	189000	She came up to you and put a crayon in your mouth?
189000	193000	She put a crayon in my mouth. And looking back at it as an adult, what I pictured,
193000	200000	the weird thing is I hate her so much, but also I'm able to recognize,
200000	205000	because she said something like, you could be pretty or something.
205000	212000	She was really wanting to use the crayon as lipstick. She wanted to put lipstick on me.
213000	214000	She was giving you a makeover.
214000	220000	Yeah, which is probably flirting as far as what 40-year-olds are concerned or how old we were.
220000	225000	And so on one hand, I'm able to recognize that she meant no harm and on the other hand,
225000	233000	at 42, I still have all of the revulsion and hatred that my tiny brain felt
233000	239000	because I had no idea what the hell. Why would someone lunge at me and stick a crayon in my lips?
239000	241000	Did she ram it into your mouth?
241000	246000	She had bad aim. Our muscles were protoplasmic.
246000	249000	Do you think there was a chance that she was trying to be inclusive?
249000	253000	Yeah, that's what I just said.
253000	257000	Oh, you mean inclusive? You mean like progressively?
257000	262000	She was thinking about gender roles? No. I think she was Drew Barrymore and I was E.T.
262000	265000	She was doing a clumsy job of befriending you.
265000	272000	Yeah, she wanted to play house. Maybe she wanted to play sexy time, I don't know.
272000	275000	But I don't think she was like...
275000	283000	It's years from that age before kids developed a part of their brain that knows that I'm a disgusting monster.
283000	290000	That comes right before a sense of direction.
291000	296000	They've done studies where they put six-year-old girls into an MRI
296000	304000	and they study the centers of their brains that light up and they show a picture of Dan Harmon.
304000	312000	And from five and a half to six, it's like same section as ice cream or like a fire hydrant.
312000	316000	I shouldn't have said same section as ice cream.
317000	322000	Because we live in this, now we're all pedophiles era.
322000	327000	Every time you mention a child, our brains are waiting for the pedophile thing.
327000	331000	So I said ice cream, which is something you lick.
331000	337000	So let's just abandon this whole thing.
337000	344000	Well, to finish my thought, then at six they show...
344000	349000	And they show a picture of me and then it's like, oh, it's the space shuttle Challenger exploding.
349000	355000	Or a Shrek, or I don't know, like a chicken pox.
355000	358000	I'm trying to think, what do six-year-olds hate?
358000	364000	Oh, when our space program goes awry, that's what they hate.
364000	370000	When you were elementary school, pre-school through fifth grade,
370000	373000	was there ever any flirtation romance stories in your life?
373000	375000	Was it ever not awkward?
375000	378000	Oh, God. Well, Spencer, remember when I was in the car with you?
378000	379000	Oh, yeah.
379000	381000	Every day for the last two years?
381000	383000	It was great, man.
383000	385000	I feel like you're not supposed to...
385000	394000	It's not like a black box cabaret show anymore, but I want to say her whole name.
394000	397000	Because that was all she was, was a name.
397000	400000	Literally a little redhead girl, which is like a Charlie Brown thing.
400000	402000	It was kindergarten.
402000	405000	See, the lipstick girl, the Korean girl, was like, what are you doing?
405000	408000	She was probably a brunette or something.
408000	411000	But my first...
411000	416000	Oh, it was when Yvonne Craig passed away and I was thinking about...
416000	417000	Oh, Yvonne Craig.
417000	418000	And I was thinking of early...
418000	422000	What was my first redhead moment?
422000	424000	Well, I didn't know they were redhead.
424000	429000	What was my first spark of...
429000	431000	What is it, acetaminophen that makes you...
431000	441000	I don't know.
441000	442000	I don't have to explain anything.
442000	444000	I'm laughing at myself.
444000	450000	But if they isolated the chemical that makes you fall in love and it's acetaminophen...
450000	454000	And everyone's like, oh, this explains everything.
454000	456000	We were never looking for that connection.
456000	461000	Oh, God, I got married because I had a hangover and I...
461000	465000	Oh, my God, acetaminophen, that's it.
465000	469000	Anyways, yeah, Nicole, it was...
469000	472000	In kindergarten, they take roll call and they go...
472000	479000	They say, you know, they say your name and then you go here.
479000	484000	Dan, back it up and walk me through this.
484000	488000	Pretend I never went to school and explained...
488000	490000	My last name was Harmon.
490000	493000	Back then, my first name was either...
493000	495000	Was it Daniel or Danny?
495000	496000	Probably Daniel.
496000	497000	Yeah, probably Daniel.
497000	499000	Yeah, Daniel, yeah, for sure.
499000	502000	Is this the same class where Royal Champagne went to?
502000	504000	No, that was middle school.
504000	509000	Nobody in kindergarten stood up and said, you may call me Royal Champagne.
509000	512000	That would be amazing.
512000	513000	No, we're kindergarten.
513000	514000	We're still...
514000	517000	Some of us are still pooping our pants.
517000	520000	To this very day.
520000	522000	And so I...
522000	528000	We were sitting in a circle and the way we sat and the order in which our names were called,
528000	530000	there was always this pattern.
530000	532000	And the H's come before the M's.
532000	535000	And her name, you know...
535000	537000	Let's just cross our fingers.
537000	540000	Maybe she won't sue us and that this isn't defamation of any kind.
540000	541000	Her name seems like...
541000	542000	I'm not going to change her name.
542000	544000	Her name was Nicole McHugh.
544000	545000	This is such a...
545000	547000	You know, it's such a perfect, like...
547000	553000	It's like fictional, like kind of first, you know, little girl crush kind of name.
553000	555000	And she...
555000	558000	Daniel Harmon and I'd go...
558000	561000	I don't know who started it and what happened.
561000	566000	But like somehow just the tradition became that whenever my name was called,
566000	574000	I would say here and I'd look at her and she'd smile and we'd both smile and then we'd giggle.
574000	576000	And then name, name, name.
576000	577000	Piece of shit.
577000	580000	Random piece of shit.
580000	582000	And then the same.
582000	585000	And then when Nicole McHugh and she would raise her hand and we would lock eyes again
585000	587000	and then we'd giggle and smile.
587000	588000	And it was like...
588000	589000	That was the entire relationship.
589000	592000	I never talked to her on the playground.
592000	596000	And I probably made the whole thing up in my head.
596000	600000	I probably just created huge gaps where she was probably giggling at everybody.
600000	601000	No, I really don't think that.
601000	603000	Well, of course you don't think that, Dan.
603000	605000	You made it up in your head.
605000	606000	You invented thoughts.
606000	608000	Of course you think them.
608000	609000	But I...
609000	612000	Well, I don't remember them as hallucinations.
612000	618000	I had the same thing with kindergarten, I think, with the same initials, N.M.
618000	619000	Her name was Nancy Mendelson.
619000	623000	And I had this fantasy relationship with her that never existed.
623000	625000	I don't know that we ever spoke to each other.
625000	627000	But in my mind, wow, we were quite in love.
627000	630000	And I don't think I ever had a moment's conversation with her.
630000	633000	It's all downhill from there, man.
633000	634000	You know?
634000	637000	Spencer, do you have an early proto-relationship like that?
637000	638000	No, man.
638000	641000	You guys are fucking nerds.
641000	651000	Okay, and we have a new segment.
651000	657680	This new segment is called Possibly Awesome Ideas I Came Up With During a Blackout Drunk
657680	661000	at the TV Guide Showrunners Party.
661000	666800	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
666800	669200	This TV Guide has a party.
669200	674880	And they invite all the smarties that make the TV like Shonda Rhimes and Dan Harmon gets
674880	681920	invited some of the time, except for season four and he'll never forget it.
681920	686500	But now he's back and he's at the table because Rick and Morty showed them all I was able,
686500	692800	so I get to sit there and get real drunk and I talk too loud and I feel bad the next morning.
693800	703800	There's a little iced tea in there.
703800	707800	You're about to get sued three times now.
707800	711800	Well, you know, that's just business.
711800	717800	Okay, so I came up with this idea.
717800	718800	Chris McKenna was there.
718800	720800	I asked him, I don't know, I wrote it down.
720800	722800	I was like, I'm so proud of this idea.
722800	723800	I have no idea.
723800	727800	Like, I was like, okay, so it's a dystopian premise.
727800	730800	It's called peak Hitler.
730800	732800	Peak, like peak oil.
732800	739800	It's it because it's in the future where what I wrote down is, but this guy was drunk.
739800	746800	A world where temporally oligarchic corporations draw oil from the subcutaneous residue of
747800	752800	a supposedly infinite supply of Hitler's.
752800	756800	Supposedly.
756800	761800	So it's like in the future they find out that like there's everyone right under their scalp
761800	764800	or between their skull and their brain or maybe right between their scalp and their skull.
764800	765800	Who knows?
765800	767800	Or maybe at the base of their spine.
767800	773800	Everyone has like a just a tiny little bit of oil that you could use to run a car.
773800	779800	Because firm whales used to have like the giant gallons of like lamp oil.
779800	785800	So a corporation goes like, look, we have time travel now.
785800	787800	There are infinite timelines.
787800	793800	Raise your hand if you're against drilling into Hitler.
793800	796800	And everyone's like, that's the cold hope of the movie.
796800	798800	Everyone's like, nice.
798800	801800	And then they're like, the lack of nays have it.
801800	807800	A mobile time warner will commence with its Hitler oil campaign.
807800	813800	And then you can and then it goes three thousand eighty.
813800	817800	And then there's like because I think they keep going back in time and drilling into the same Hitler.
817800	823800	Are there are there more than infinite Hitler's infinite Hitler's like every time Hitler does or doesn't slip in the shower
823800	826800	or take a take an art class or whatever.
826800	831800	Like he becomes a technically different Hitler from the from from all the other Hitler's.
831800	835800	But they're all Hitler.
835800	839800	Therefore you got quantum quantum and infinite oil is infinite oil, baby.
839800	842800	It doesn't matter if you get one drop per Hitler.
842800	844800	And so and so you see the process.
844800	846800	But that's that's the that's the ordinary world.
846800	853800	And then the and then the threshold you cross is like there's a technician who's like he encounters like it's like, you know,
853800	864800	you know, the question of like, I think this guy was I don't I don't I don't know if this I don't know if this guy was going to end up being that bad a Hitler.
864800	866800	One of the alternate.
866800	869800	Yeah, he's like like like that's like the hit that was a good artist.
869800	872800	It's like it's like it's like Project X with Matthew Broderick.
872800	875800	Matthew Broderick is the guy who's in charge of like or Minority Report.
875800	880800	It's like, you know, it's like any other like you know, you have a guy who's in charge of doing this thing.
880800	891800	And this is the way the world works is you take a Hitler, you put like a transparent plastic dome on his head, like while he's walking down an alleyway in Austria or something.
891800	894800	And and he's like, oh, God, God and him all.
894800	898800	And you're like, you know, and you're like, look, I know you can't understand me.
898800	901800	But but but but but but trust me, you're Hitler.
901800	908800	And like this is this is going to hurt you more than it's going to hurt my car.
908800	914800	And then it's like the title sequence.
914800	920800	And I know I have a lot of cold opens in this movie, but so.
920800	924800	But then the threshold is like a guy is like like, you know, there's like a guy.
924800	927800	I don't like the drill bit breaks or something.
927800	928800	And then it's like something goes wrong.
928800	931800	And then the Hitler starts running and the guy's like, God damn it.
931800	933800	We got a fucking is it like a major?
933800	934800	This is this is temporal.
934800	935800	This is temporal.
935800	937800	See, I mean, number seven, five, two.
937800	938800	We got we got a runner.
938800	939800	I'll get him.
939800	941800	And he's like chasing him, chasing him back to Hitler's apartment.
941800	943800	And he kind of he's like, he's like, let me in there.
943800	944800	Hitler.
944800	945800	You're fucking Hitler.
945800	946800	I know you don't get that.
946800	948800	He's like, oh, nine, nine, nine.
948800	951800	And he's like, I'm kicking down that fucking door.
951800	952800	Hitler.
952800	953800	I'm kicking it down.
953800	957800	I don't care if you have a Walther P 38 under the under your mattress.
957800	958800	Nice.
958800	961800	I bet you will try to shoot me because you're Hitler.
961800	965800	But but it won't matter because it kicks down the door.
965800	971800	And then the camera pushes on just an adorable Hitler.
971800	974800	Like, who do you cast as adorable Hitler?
974800	975800	Who's the actor?
975800	986800	Well, don't get sued a fourth time.
986800	990800	Probably not Hugh Jackman, but at the same time.
990800	991800	I don't know.
991800	994800	Like, and it's not, you know, let's just put a pin in that.
994800	995800	Okay.
995800	999800	But it's like, the point is like, like, like, maybe it's a CG Hitler.
999800	1001800	Maybe it's like, maybe it's like Gollum.
1001800	1005800	You know, you create a Hitler so that you can get really accurate.
1005800	1007800	I think you put like a Jake Gyllenhaal or Tobey Maguire in there.
1007800	1009800	I think you make it like, oh, Jake Gyllenhaal.
1009800	1010800	Yeah.
1010800	1011800	Tobey Maguire is good.
1011800	1012800	I like that.
1012800	1013800	Yeah.
1013800	1014800	Tobey.
1014800	1015800	Oh, no.
1015800	1016800	Elijah Wood.
1016800	1017800	Who?
1017800	1018800	Oh, yeah.
1018800	1019800	Elijah Wood.
1020800	1021800	Guys, we got a Hitler.
1024800	1029800	So it pushes on him and he's doing, you know, fill in the blanks.
1029800	1030800	But, you know, I'm a structure guy.
1030800	1031800	I'm a dialogue guy.
1031800	1034800	I'm not a fucking like, I don't care about the details.
1034800	1043800	He's like, you know, he's got a kitten or he's like, you know, he's like setting fire to sonnets that he wrote to some areas.
1043800	1048800	He's like, he's like, he's doing something that this guy, it's like, it violates.
1048800	1050800	Just give me one second.
1051800	1057800	Whatever he sees when he kicks down that door, it's specifically the first 15 pages of the script.
1057800	1060800	It said that this is not how Hitler's work.
1060800	1061800	Right.
1061800	1063800	Like they don't have feelings.
1063800	1064800	That was my question.
1064800	1068800	What set this, one of these infinite Hitlers, what set him off on a different board?
1068800	1072800	This is that wooden ball that comes down the minority tube.
1072800	1078800	That's like, you know, oh, I thought the trans trans trans trans trans cognitive.
1078800	1079800	I thought they didn't.
1079800	1081800	I thought they didn't make mistakes or whatever.
1081800	1086800	I thought I thought Hitler's didn't have pets, you know, I thought they loved.
1086800	1087800	I thought they loved racism.
1087800	1088800	And he says, I didn't.
1088800	1090800	I don't know what you're talking about.
1090800	1091800	I'm just I'm just me.
1091800	1093800	Like, no, you're one of a million possible Hitlers.
1093800	1094800	Yeah.
1094800	1096800	And he's like, well, why is that a bad thing?
1097800	1107800	And then the guy's like, like, he just hears like, I don't know if they had sirens back then, but then he just goes like, and he like shoots him with a silencer.
1107800	1109800	But like, and you think he just killed him.
1109800	1114800	But then it turns out he like put him in a bag and he takes him to a field and he sets him free.
1114800	1116800	It's not about that Hitler.
1116800	1125800	It's about an industry running on on infinite Hitlers and the idea of, you know, if there are infinite Hitlers, then it's the idea that we've run out of battle.
1125800	1127800	We've run out of bad Hitlers.
1127800	1128800	That's the thing.
1128800	1132800	It's like the fucking still corporate greed in a world of infinite timelines.
1132800	1136800	They've taken oil out of all of the bad Hitlers.
1136800	1142800	They've created a universe, a multiverse in which the only thing remaining are average Hitlers.
1142800	1150800	But but but the head of the oil company is saying, look, we can still get away with even mining oil out of good Hitlers because they're still Hitlers.
1150800	1152800	And there's somebody that works underneath that person.
1152800	1158800	It's like, no, you're we're now just dealing with regular people now, just regular good Hitlers.
1158800	1160800	Is the Hitler is one of the good Hitlers.
1160800	1167800	Is Elijah Wood Hitler the protagonist of this or is the oil industry guy that sets those Hitlers free?
1167800	1170800	Elijah Wood as Hitler is the polar ice caps.
1170800	1175800	You know, he's like or oil, you know, it's like it's like he's like the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park.
1175800	1177800	Certainly part of the draw.
1177800	1178800	Definitely on the poster.
1178800	1181800	Is there is there a Jeff is there a protagonist?
1181800	1186800	Is there a Jeff Goldblum character who steps in and says, I think what you're doing is unethical.
1186800	1189800	Yes. All right.
1189800	1193800	Moving on to another segment.
1193800	1194800	Actually, we could keep this.
1194800	1201800	Well, OK. Awesome things I came up with in a different blackout drugs that weren't at the TV guy party.
1201800	1202800	That's the segment.
1202800	1203800	You want some music for that?
1203800	1204800	Yeah.
1205800	1208800	Yeah. Dan drinks a lot.
1208800	1210800	So the stories aren't all he's got.
1210800	1215800	He doesn't just wait till TV guy's party to get sloshed.
1215800	1217800	He does it all the time.
1217800	1218800	And he's always awesome.
1218800	1222800	And he always comes up with things that he has to write down.
1222800	1223800	OK.
1225800	1226800	Was drinking with Dino.
1226800	1227800	Dino was talking about.
1227800	1236800	So so Dino assuming he has he does not mind details about his.
1236800	1239800	I think if he were here, he would share any old secret.
1239800	1246800	So he has he has he has a he has a tattoo of like right above his wiener.
1246800	1248800	He has somebody was asking him about a chance.
1248800	1252800	He has like a tattoo that's like a thing in Greek on his arm.
1252800	1255800	But then somebody was asking him, is that the only tattoo you have?
1255800	1257800	And he's like, well, I do have another one.
1257800	1258800	And it's above.
1258800	1260800	It's above my wiener.
1260800	1262800	He said it's in my bikini area.
1264800	1267800	So that means it's like unless he's shaving it all the time.
1267800	1269800	It's like hidden by hairs.
1269800	1270800	Right.
1271800	1272800	Yeah.
1272800	1273800	You're you're you're.
1273800	1274800	Well, yeah.
1274800	1278800	Is the art of the design worked into that?
1278800	1279800	No, no, no, no.
1279800	1280800	It's like a lurking.
1280800	1282800	I saw Dino in New York with this.
1282800	1285800	I saw Dino when Dino passed out in New York with his pants down.
1285800	1286800	I saw him.
1286800	1290800	His his pants were he had a belt on and his pants were fastened and zipped up.
1290800	1293800	But it was still below his dick and balls.
1293800	1297800	And he was wearing women's tights and fetish underwear.
1297800	1302800	What it was cut out so I could see his dick and balls through through mesh.
1302800	1304800	I don't think he was wearing women's tights.
1304800	1306800	I think he was just wearing a special underwear.
1306800	1308800	No, I mean, there it was.
1308800	1309800	Yeah, it was fetish.
1309800	1310800	So a lot of layers.
1310800	1311800	Yeah, it was a lot of layers.
1311800	1313800	I mean, his pants weren't around his ankles.
1313800	1314800	How would you know?
1314800	1316800	They were like below, like mid thighs.
1316800	1317800	All right.
1317800	1320800	I saw no tattoo is what I'm saying.
1320800	1321800	All right.
1321800	1324800	So this is this story is about me.
1327800	1333800	The point of departure is that I have a friend who has a tattoo above his penis dick.
1333800	1341800	I keep pausing before I say dick, but not because I think there's like an S&P department
1341800	1343800	because I just feel like I don't know the word.
1343800	1345800	I keep saying the word dick because it's about a tattoo of a dick.
1345800	1347800	I'm like, I don't know.
1347800	1350800	I was like somehow categorizing that as like, oh, what kind of podcast is this?
1350800	1351800	I don't know.
1351800	1354800	I don't know what my I don't know what my fucking deal is.
1354800	1356800	But the story is about you, man.
1356800	1357800	There's it.
1357800	1358800	There's it.
1358800	1359800	So I go, OK.
1359800	1360800	Oh, boy.
1360800	1362800	Well, this is because like, why is there a tattoo of your dick?
1363800	1369800	Dominatrix put it there as a as a form of domination.
1369800	1374800	She was like, she was like, she was like, you know, putting it there to like humiliate me.
1374800	1375800	I was like, oh, boy.
1375800	1376800	Oh, what what is it?
1376800	1378800	And he's like, it's an X.
1378800	1380800	And I was like, what?
1380800	1381800	That's what's on treasure.
1381800	1382800	What?
1383800	1390800	That's like, like, like what that like in the worst case scenario, it means 10 something.
1391800	1392800	It doesn't even.
1393800	1395800	Or you got something wrong on Family Feud.
1399800	1400800	Or bold a strike.
1401800	1402800	But you're right.
1402800	1404800	That is the worst case scenario is you lost on family.
1404800	1407800	But still kidding on family viewed as a big deal.
1407800	1408800	Anyways.
1411800	1413800	Did you just send me a text, Spencer?
1413800	1414800	No, man.
1414800	1415800	Oh, wait.
1415800	1419800	I guess I probably did because I responded to Steve, who is texting us.
1419800	1420800	Sorry.
1420800	1421800	All right.
1421800	1425800	So the shit I have to go through and all right.
1425800	1426800	So he had this story.
1426800	1427800	This story has a point.
1428800	1433800	Again, as with the last story, it's about the great ideas that I have and how good I am at what I do.
1434800	1437800	So he goes like it's an accident of crime.
1437800	1445800	So then it was like we're going like, well, you know, Drew Hancock and Wade Randolph were there at the drug room and we're all like an axe and axe.
1445800	1447800	And he's like, look, she's not she's not a writer.
1447800	1448800	She's a dominatrix.
1448800	1452800	Like, OK, well, let's beat this tattoo.
1452800	1459800	You know, like, what would you tattoo above someone's dick to like and I we didn't brainstorm for a long time.
1459800	1463800	Like I the thing I'm proud of is that this was the first.
1463800	1465800	This is it for me.
1466800	1468800	I didn't bother your first pitch.
1468800	1469800	Yeah. Yeah.
1469800	1471800	I didn't like hit a bunch of areas and pick the best ones.
1471800	1472800	I think this is it.
1472800	1474800	I just picked. I was like, OK, well, what do you do?
1474800	1475800	And I was like, OK, I got it.
1475800	1476800	I got it.
1476800	1477800	OK.
1477800	1487800	So so in in in in in in 1938, there was this cartoon called Nancy and it was like syndicated in like the 80s and stuff.
1487800	1488800	I'm sure eventually it went away.
1488800	1491800	It was like a little like a little.
1491800	1497800	I should have pulled up like a you know, it's like a like like like the younger people probably won't remember like people my age.
1497800	1500800	I probably remember when Nancy and Marma Duke and all this shit were in the paper.
1500800	1504800	Like one of these things was like like she was kind of drawn in a steamboat Willie style.
1504800	1505800	It was like such an old cartoon.
1505800	1508800	It was like originated in 1938 kind of had a black bob haircut.
1508800	1510800	Yeah. She was just on Wikipedia.
1510800	1515800	It says she was a she is a chubby precocious eight year old.
1515800	1516800	That was the gimmick.
1516800	1518800	That's how young cartoons were like.
1518800	1520800	Like that was that was ironic.
1520800	1527800	It was like what if what if what if she was chubby and precocious cut cut to the guy making shoe.
1527800	1528800	And he's like fuck.
1528800	1530800	I don't know what if birds worked in an office.
1530800	1531800	Fuck me.
1531800	1541800	I'd love to just draw chubby girls all day hanging out making mistakes learning about life.
1541800	1544800	So Nancy was Nancy was a chubby precocious girl.
1544800	1551800	Like what the kind of like I think like oval kind of like almost a little orphan Annie but filled in eyes.
1551800	1558800	And the thing is like every time in that cartoon every time she'd look at something there would be like a dotted line going from her eyes.
1558800	1564800	So so that's that's why I needed to use her because I don't care about that cartoon but it is.
1564800	1566800	But but I also think it's really funny.
1566800	1567800	It's really funny the specifics of it.
1567800	1575800	So it's Nancy like like above his dick and she's looking at the dotted line goes down to his dick.
1575800	1587800	And then there's a thought balloon above her head and it's a dollar sign with a line through it.
1587800	1600800	And the captain is Hey Dino 1938 called your dick's worthless.
1600800	1602800	I was just very proud of it.
1602800	1606800	So I wrote it down and it took me 40 minutes to explain it.
1606800	1608800	I think I think it holds up.
1608800	1609800	Yeah.
1609800	1612800	So does Pete Hitler.
1612800	1625800	Oh speaking of Pete Hitler it takes less gasoline than is in one Hitler to go to an alternate timeline.
1625800	1627800	Yes because.
1627800	1628800	Well here's the thing.
1628800	1629800	Okay.
1629800	1631800	So it's corporations.
1631800	1632800	Okay.
1632800	1643800	Well my my my knee jerk answer to that is you know have you seen scandalous.
1643800	1644800	I mean come on.
1644800	1645800	No no.
1645800	1651800	I mean my knee jerk reaction is is it's a corporation.
1651800	1655800	They don't they just want there to keep being oil.
1655800	1657800	They don't care how much it costs.
1658800	1665800	Well they have if Exxon has has like the ability to time travel.
1665800	1666800	Yeah.
1666800	1668800	They're just going to use it to sell you more oil.
1668800	1675800	They're not going to come out with a car called the new Ford instantaneous.
1675800	1677800	Now you don't have to really drive.
1677800	1680800	You can just sit in a car with no wheels and blink to your office.
1680800	1682800	They'd be like then we're out of fucking money.
1682800	1683800	Yeah yeah.
1683800	1684800	So there.
1684800	1685800	I don't know.
1685800	1686800	And come on.
1686800	1687800	I know.
1687800	1688800	I know it has holes in it.
1688800	1689800	I.
1689800	1690800	Yeah.
1690800	1691800	No.
1691800	1692800	I mean I'm I'm thinking of all sorts of ways to solve that.
1692800	1693800	I mean how.
1693800	1694800	Let me.
1694800	1695800	Let me.
1695800	1696800	Let me.
1696800	1697800	Let me.
1697800	1698800	Let me.
1698800	1699800	Let me answer your question with a question.
1699800	1708960	So are you telling me that that in the future the fossil fuels driven industries have shrunk
1708960	1713360	our polar ice caps to the point where there's now more room to drill and that's what they
1713360	1715120	want to do.
1715120	1717800	Like that's crazy too.
1717800	1722800	That is crazy.
1722800	1726720	Yeah.
1726720	1728120	Hold it.
1728120	1730680	Hold it for 30 more seconds then.
1730680	1741520	Twenty nine twenty eight twenty seven twenty six twenty five twenty four twenty three twenty
1741520	1756480	two twenty one twenty nineteen eighteen seventy twenty three twenty two fourteen thirteen
1756480	1782320	twelve eleven ten nine he hasn't even blinked seven six five four three two one.
1782320	1789120	When you hold your head real still people hold your heart.
1789120	1790120	Can I clap.
1790120	1791120	Beat me.
1791120	1799360	I think we just we might have made podcast history there.
1799360	1804000	We certainly we certainly we certainly proved all of my detractors right that this is definitely
1804000	1812720	a show that succeeds more any cult of personality than than any actual empirical measurable
1812720	1813720	value.
1813720	1820520	If you're just looking at a guy who's not doing not blinking and that's not on you guys
1820520	1821520	that's on me.
1821520	1823440	I should bring more to the table.
1823440	1824440	Well.
1824440	1835640	I mean I thought we I what I'm just stretching.
1835640	1840360	You just you just do that because you know it makes your tits look good.
1840360	1843800	I need all the help I can get man.

1859400	1863320	There's I'm talking about guys like like like the naked lady pictures they have like a certain
1863320	1866960	rules that are based on certain angles and stuff and I don't know what they are.
1866960	1870520	I was I was referencing that concept without knowing what they are.
1870520	1871520	It doesn't matter.
1871520	1872520	It's.
1872520	1886320	I just wanted to meet meet meet like like like like like we should wait like like give

1930600	1933120	It's like the New Zealand of the United States.
1933120	1936960	I don't think I think we've had five people from New Zealand up here and never won.
1936960	1939760	So we're lousy with Kiwis on the stage.
1939760	1940960	I like that.
1940960	1944200	The thing I admire about New Hampshire guys that the entire time there was like some of
1944200	1948320	the like Hong Kong, New Hampshire, Tunisia, New Hampshire.
1948320	1949320	What city?
1949320	1950320	Miami, New Hampshire.
1950320	1951320	New Hampshire.
1951320	1953040	Who's New Hampshire?
1953040	1954040	What city in New Hampshire?
1954040	1955040	Manchester.
1955040	1958280	Manchester actually is that very quaint and colonial like kind of gorgeous and like like
1958280	1964240	old like very like I think I think I went through there and it was lots of like like
1964240	1966760	revolutionary war monuments and stuff like that.
1966760	1967760	Am I making that up?
1967760	1974560	Oh, there's there's there's Manchester in like Vermont and okay, so yeah, I've been
1974560	1983760	to I've been to Keene, New Hampshire is it near there now, all right, fuck you.
1983760	1984840	Is New Hampshire beautiful right now?
1984840	1987320	Is it was it fall foliage time out there?
1988320	1991000	Did you come here for work or for pleasure?
1991000	1992000	Pleasure.
1992000	1995000	New Hampshire Pleasure Guy, come up on stage.
1995000	1997000	New Hampshire Pleasure Guy.
2002000	2004000	What's your name, sir?
2004000	2005000	Pat.
2005000	2006000	Hello, Pat.
2006000	2011520	What brings you all the way from New Hampshire to Los Angeles for your own pleasure?
2011520	2013520	What pleasure are you seeking here, Pat?
2013520	2017640	I came to visit some friends but mostly go to Disney with my girlfriend.
2017640	2018640	Oh, yeah?
2018640	2019640	Yeah.
2019640	2022040	You know, this is Disney a lot closer to New Hampshire than this one.
2022040	2023040	Like in Florida?
2023040	2024200	Yeah, but we've been to that one way too much.
2024200	2025200	Yeah.
2025200	2026200	What, New York Disney?
2026200	2027200	Disney World in Florida.
2027200	2028200	It's closer.
2028200	2029200	Oh, it's closer.
2029200	2030200	Okay.
2030200	2032640	Worcester, Massachusetts, Disney.
2032640	2034480	I just think of the country as a square.
2034480	2036480	So all the corners are the same distance.
2036480	2039440	I'm like, oh, you might as well go to.
2039440	2040440	But even that would be.
2040440	2041440	Not even though squares were.
2041440	2042440	Yeah.
2042440	2043440	Yeah.
2044440	2045440	Yeah.
2045440	2047800	So have you gone to Disneyland here yet?
2047800	2048800	Yeah.
2048800	2049800	Yeah.
2049800	2050800	We've.
2050800	2052720	I found out a couple of days ago and somebody texted me and I was sad to know this.
2052720	2055880	I love Disneyland that it was dapper day where everyone goes.
2055880	2056880	That's what we went for.
2056880	2057880	Did you go?
2057880	2058880	I did not go.
2058880	2059880	Alec, right?
2059880	2060880	Yeah.
2060880	2061880	Alec, our dapper bow tie wearing friend.
2061880	2064840	I had a bunch of friends go and I was so sad that I wasn't invited to go with them.
2064840	2065840	I didn't know about it.
2065840	2066840	I would have fucking gone.
2066840	2068920	Actually, no, I couldn't have gone because I was out of town, but I would have loved
2068920	2070080	to have been there.
2070080	2071640	So everybody is all fancy pants.
2071640	2072640	Everyone's dressed up.
2072640	2073640	Yeah.
2073640	2074640	That's who.
2074640	2075640	Did anybody go?
2075640	2076640	You went?
2076640	2077640	Yeah.
2077640	2078640	Wait, you guys went?
2078640	2079640	That's my girlfriend.
2079640	2080640	Pat.
2080640	2081640	What's your name?
2081640	2082640	Hannah.
2082640	2083640	Hannah, get up here.
2083640	2084640	Hannah.
2084640	2085640	I'm shooting fast and loose.
2085640	2086640	Yeah, you are.
2086640	2088880	I want to talk about dapper day.
2088880	2089880	Okay.
2089880	2090880	So you guys knew about dapper day.
2090880	2093200	Is that why you came from New Hampshire to LA?
2093200	2094400	Part of the reason why we came.
2094400	2095400	Okay.
2095400	2096400	Now what goes on at dapper day?
2096400	2101280	What do you, first off, what did you guys wear to dapper day at Disneyland?
2101280	2110840	I just had a blue watercolor-y flower dress with an insanely hot petticoat underneath
2110840	2111840	it.
2111840	2112840	All right.
2112840	2113840	Was it 1,000 degrees?
2113840	2114840	Yeah.
2114840	2115840	It was way hot.
2115840	2116840	Way too hot to be dapper.
2116840	2121040	For some reason, I decided to go all the way and curl my hair frontwards, which meant that
2121040	2124800	it just fell in front of my face every time I tried to do something.
2124800	2128040	You know who loves that?
2128040	2129040	Cats.
2129040	2134240	And the cat in every man.
2134240	2138600	Now, Hannah and Pat, have you guys ever been to Disney World or Disneyland before?
2138600	2139600	Yeah.
2139600	2140600	We've been to Disney World.
2140600	2141600	Yeah.
2141600	2142600	Like, I don't know how many times.
2142600	2144240	Once a year since we started dating.
2144240	2146400	Once a year since you started, how long have you been dating?
2146400	2147400	Five years.
2147400	2148400	Five years?
2148400	2149400	Yeah.
2149400	2150400	Almost six.
2150400	2153640	So every year you come from New Hampshire to California to Florida?
2153640	2154640	To Florida.
2154640	2155640	To Florida, too.
2155640	2156640	Okay.
2156640	2157640	And this time you're coming to California.
2157640	2158640	California.
2159240	2161160	Except you traveling that distance.
2161160	2163920	Did you have an extra hard year at work?
2163920	2167160	And so you're like, all right, now I'm going to go to the real Disneyland.
2167160	2168160	Yeah.
2168160	2169160	Yeah.
2169160	2172840	Like, I work a crazy schedule and we just barely ever get to see each other.
2172840	2176560	Can we ask what you do without prying?
2176560	2179640	After asking you to come up on stage?
2179640	2183560	During the day, I clean cars at a rental car company.
2183560	2187480	And at night, I am a PA for a news station.
2187480	2189680	Oh my God.
2189680	2197400	Were you clean cars for the rental company of America's thirst for blood?
2197400	2203640	Did you guys enjoy the original Magic Kingdom more or less than the later one in Florida?
2203640	2205320	I got to say the sequel's better.
2205320	2206320	The stock sequel's better?
2206320	2207320	Oh, yeah.
2207320	2208320	It's a lot bigger.
2208320	2209320	Yeah.
2209320	2210320	A lot more to do.
2210320	2213600	I've been to them both, but I'm partial to the Anaheim one because my mom worked there,
2213600	2219200	I think, in the 60s, and her daughters from her first marriage worked there in the 70s,
2219200	2221600	and I worked there in the 90s.
2221600	2223080	So I love Disneyland.
2223080	2226320	Well, I'm distracted by something.
2226320	2233760	I love Disney and I love clothes, but you said you do this thing in the morning and
2233760	2235520	then at night you do this.
2235520	2237320	How do you sleep?
2237320	2238320	Never.
2238320	2239320	Never?
2239320	2240320	Never.
2240720	2244160	And so these vacations are more important.
2244160	2248880	My life is a vacation and I work the whole time, but my job is a vacation.
2248880	2253160	When I drop my rental car off, I'm like, oh, oh, Hannah, what are you doing?
2253160	2258240	I think about someone that turns out to be you, and I go, oh, man, like now I walk away
2258240	2263720	and I put, I didn't, my back hurts, I don't want to get that straw wrapper, and it's like,
2263720	2267280	and then you're like, well, I'm going to do this for all day, and then at night I'm going
2267280	2269120	to go to that place.
2269120	2273240	So when you go to a place for vacation, it's incredibly important, and probably to her
2273240	2277600	as well, because you guys have been five years, that's longer than I've been.
2277600	2279600	Hannah, what are your work hours, Hannah?
2279600	2280600	Do you work a lot too?
2280600	2288320	Well, I work Monday through Friday at a life insurance company, and then I work at a part-time
2288320	2294320	job at Market Basket, and then we have a four-year-old who, so that's-
2294320	2296000	Oh, you have a kid dealer?
2296000	2297000	Mm-hmm.
2297000	2298000	You guys are busy.
2298000	2299000	Yeah.
2299880	2300880	We're really busy.
2300880	2301880	But you're not married, right?
2301880	2302880	No.
2302880	2303880	No.
2303880	2304880	Okay.
2304880	2305880	So you have a kid together for four years.
2305880	2308840	I did want to change that, maybe.
2308840	2314440	So in front of Mayor, Comptroller, and Harminians-
2314440	2319440	I can authorize this, by the way.
2319440	2320440	I'm taking over the show.
2320440	2321440	All right.
2321440	2322440	I'll allow it.
2322440	2333440	You're an amazing mother, and you are an amazing girlfriend, and will you marry me?
2353440	2359720	The funny- I guess it's not kind of funny, but I think I'm sitting on your mic.
2359720	2363640	We were standing in line at Disney yesterday, and she was telling me about how she had a
2363640	2368560	dream that I had not in touch with you, and I proposed her at Harmin Town.
2368560	2374280	Well, maybe her dream was her phone glowing in the corner of the room because you tweeted
2374280	2375280	me two weeks ago.
2375280	2376280	Yeah.
2376280	2379760	I was like, this is a public- take this on the DL.
2380480	2387680	Yeah, Hannah, not to make this about me, but did I pull that off where you fooled at all?
2387680	2389840	Did that feel organic, and then surprising?
2389840	2390840	Yeah.
2390840	2393920	Well, I don't- I don't ever use Twitter.
2393920	2394920	I have one.
2394920	2395920	Oh, good.
2395920	2396920	Good.
2396920	2397920	Well, I blocked you anyway.
2397920	2400920	I never even thought of that.
2400920	2401920	Yeah.
2401920	2402920	Perfect.
2402920	2403920	Just blocker.
2403920	2418160	So, I was hoping that it was going to be at Disney, and so all day today- no, no, no,
2418160	2421160	no, no, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
2421160	2422160	It's okay.
2422160	2423160	You have the floor.
2423160	2424160	No.
2424160	2429600	Like, no one's got- So then, like, a couple days before we left,
2429600	2434360	I had this dream, and I woke up, and I was like, that's what Pat's going to do.
2434360	2438040	I know him, and that's- if he's going to do anything, it's going to be this.
2438040	2443520	And then, all day today, I'm pretty sure everybody else knew because I'm getting all these text
2443520	2448720	messages like, so has your vacation, like, what's going on?
2448720	2453400	So, you kind of thought maybe that was a chance when you came here tonight that was going
2453400	2454400	to happen.
2454400	2456720	Well, I would be lying if I was saying- I wasn't hoping.
2456720	2458720	Oh, you still had a problem.
2458720	2461160	Oh, I love it.
2461160	2464840	I would be lying if I told you I wasn't crying right now.
2464840	2468240	Oh, no, it's a- That's so cool.
2468240	2470200	You guys are the cutest things in the universe.
2470200	2471200	Thank you.
2471200	2476040	I think that- I mean, I know that it's enough for you guys that the mayor of Harman Town
2476040	2483040	was present, but I also- why don't we make their engagement even more official by going
2483040	2486880	higher up on the governmental chain and bring out Senator Bernie Sanders?
2487880	2492880	Bernie Sanders to make it official.
2501880	2503880	Senator from Vermont.
2503880	2505880	Hello, sir.
2505880	2508880	Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders.
2508880	2509880	Feel the burn, everybody.
2509880	2510880	Feel the burn.
2510880	2512880	Feel the burn.
2512880	2513880	Thank you.
2513880	2515880	Thank you, Americans.
2516880	2518880	Thank you, Dan Harman.
2521880	2523880	Congratulations to, you know, all the things.
2523880	2525880	Is this really- this is New Hampshire?
2525880	2526880	Yeah.
2526880	2529880	Well, look, this is not- this is going to be- this is one of the two greatest things
2529880	2531880	that's going to happen in New Hampshire in the next six months.
2534880	2539880	Senator, your trademark humility is giving away to-
2539880	2541880	Oh, it's coming up, Bernie.
2542880	2548880	You have certainly, since the day- first day you were on my show, I have certainly learned your name.
2548880	2550880	That's right.
2551880	2552880	Senator Sanders, you-
2552880	2556880	We were off to a rocky start, but here we are, you know?
2556880	2560880	You get used to it, you get comfortable, I'm not so rough to share a hot tub with, you know?
2561880	2565880	I know that you're not- you're not the senator of New Hampshire, but you've- because you're closer now-
2565880	2566880	Same brick state, Vermont.
2566880	2567880	Vermont is a very close-
2567880	2570880	There's a very long contentious border.
2571880	2576880	We have to make sure there's, you know, that there's a balance between the marijuana being smuggled one way
2576880	2578880	and the hacky sacks being smuggled the other way.
2579880	2584880	Do you feel that you can weigh in and have any jurisdiction over this new union or this new proposal here?
2584880	2586880	Or is that going outside of your own jurisdiction?
2586880	2592880	Well, look, I mean, you know, as far as, you know, it would be a nice, you know, little thing, a button on that evening, but of course not.
2592880	2595880	No, I don't. I'm the legislative branch, of course.
2595880	2604880	I'm a former mayor of Burlington, Vermont, but there's no more Justice of the Peace powers related to it.
2604880	2605880	I'm a United States senator.
2605880	2611880	The most I could do is on your honeymoon I could bring you, you know, a large report from the 9-11 Commission.
2615880	2617880	They could step on it and say, might as well turn over.
2618880	2626880	I could share with you parts of a transpacific partnership if you wanted to read that, you know, before or after the festivities.
2628880	2633880	But that won't in any way actually matrimize them anymore.
2634880	2642880	Nope, but it would inform you, as, you know, a newlywed couple about, you know, the...
2643880	2646880	Do you have any thoughts about it? You're married, right?
2647880	2651880	I am. I am married. My wife, I think, is named Jane.
2655880	2658880	Well, if you're going to think your wife's name is something, that's a great guess.
2659880	2663880	I think my wife is Jane, and we've happily married for a long time.
2664880	2669880	We just had a great weekend up, you know, for the holiday. We're up at Lake Champlain. We were just, you know, just up there.
2670880	2680880	Mr. Sanders, forgive my impudence, but you are such a guy that the statistics, facts, numbers, the fact that you're uncertain about your own wife's name...
2681880	2683880	90% of the time, yes, continue.
2685880	2689880	I would say 95% of the time, you know the statistics about things. I'm surprised to know...
2690880	2693880	Well, that's... Look, you're not looking at the inflation or justice statistics or the statistics.
2694880	2700880	If you look at the statistics, when we started the campaign, it was about 95%, but the value of the dollar has gone up since then.
2701880	2703880	So the statistics itself has decreased convincingly.
2704880	2707880	I'm going to Google... You go on, I'm going to Google your wife's name and see what happens.
2708880	2715880	Fair enough. Look, I would prefer... I would prefer if you searched with a non-major corporate search engine...
2717880	2720880	Besides Google, maybe try DuckDuckGo.
2721880	2723880	Sorry, what? DuckDuckGo?
2724880	2725880	DuckDuckGo?
2726880	2727880	Open source, look.
2728880	2733880	Look, hop on a Linux and look it up with DuckDuckGo.
2735880	2736880	Mr. Sanders?
2737880	2739880	Her name is Jane, you are correct.
2742880	2743880	Feel the burn!
2744880	2750880	I just want to check in with our newly engaged couple and make sure... I don't know, I kind of... I thought...
2751880	2752880	Are you guys comfortable up here?
2753880	2756880	Yeah, but I don't want to be one of the people that oversees their welcome.
2757880	2764880	I want to make something very important. You're not... You're a citizen of the state of New Hampshire, but you're also a working class American.
2765880	2768880	It's about time that people like you got a chance.
2769880	2770880	Thank you.
2771880	2774880	If you don't mind, do you mind if I ask a couple of questions?
2775880	2777880	Absolutely. That would make me feel better about keeping them up here.
2778880	2780880	What was your name's path?
2781880	2783880	That sounded like a pattern.
2784880	2785880	Does it happen at the same time?
2786880	2787880	But it's had a pattern.
2788880	2790880	Okay, so what do you know? Are you in New Hampshire? What do you know?
2791880	2792880	Are you about to do a magic trick?
2793880	2796880	It seems I have nothing up my sleeves.
2797880	2798880	They're rolled up.
2798880	2803880	Nope, except an emergency set of sleeves that can come down and be rolled up if I need to demonstrate.
2806880	2809880	So Hannah and Pat, what do you do?
2811880	2816880	Sorry, you know, I do gargle milk duds before I go in front of an audience.
2817880	2819880	That sounds comical to anyone.
2820880	2824880	What is your profession? Do you have one? Crafts and services?
2825880	2827880	I work at a call center for a life insurance company.
2828880	2833880	That's fantastic. You work at a call center. That's one of the few industries that's still around in the country.
2834880	2835880	And Pat, what do you do?
2836880	2837880	I clean cars during the day and I P.A. at night.
2838880	2839880	Right, and you what at night?
2840880	2843880	I'm a P.A. at a new station.
2844880	2855880	You're involved in small local media, and you're also manual labor, contributing valuable services in both cases, call center, labor, for an average couple.
2855880	2864880	An average couple like you, newlywend America, my tax plan would increase your take home pay by over 400% on top.
2865880	2872880	While at the same time rendering it such that your employers have to pay for your health care and have to pay something in tax.
2873880	2875880	That's just what I think. That's normal and sane. That's all I think.
2876880	2879880	And look, nope, that wasn't there.
2879880	2884880	Trust me, stay with me. The rhythm wasn't there.
2885880	2889880	I know the cadence of a forced applause and that wasn't it.
2890880	2903880	If I want to force a crowd to applaud, all I have to do is continue talking at the same volume and pointing, and eventually the people will be there to join me. Thank you.
2903880	2912880	All right, well, he's so much more dynamic in prison.
2913880	2923880	I'm going to try to strike a balance between, and I think our happy couple probably maybe wants to be out of the spotlight and just smile and hold hands and watch the rest of the show, right?
2924880	2937880	Dan, maybe as mayor of Harmontown, since they chose to propose here, can you do some sort of formal, maybe we'll make up a new ritual where you kind of bind them in some sort of legally Harmontownian fashion?
2938880	2939880	It'll be our big fat Harmontown engagement.
2940880	2944880	You know what? I could do a swing, I could do a back up singing or something.
2944880	2960880	Is there like a slower, I could do like a slower nuptial rap, and then we'll have Bernie Sanders.
2961880	2965880	And then Bernie, you do the Vincent Price bridge, you know?
2966880	2970880	I'm very familiar, Sean, you're talking about Thriller, yes.
2971880	2978880	All right, and this may not rhyme because it's going to be from the heart, from the brain.
2981880	2986880	Proposal, more important than marriage, because it's the stage of marriage where marriage is still an option.
2989880	2997880	800% of tax receipts year on year come from middle and working classes, and I think that has to change.
2998880	3000880	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3001880	3007880	One life becoming two, but not quite yet. For now, right now you're happy.
3011880	3020880	There's going to be a big ceremony, one of the two of you is going to feel like you're doing too much or too little, and there will be fights.
3021880	3035880	In my belief, if the so-called greatest nation in the world cannot close and feed its children and elderly, then it cannot call itself the greatest nation in the world until it makes those things happen in this country.
3036880	3051880	But we live on a planet devoid of faith that everybody thinks that eternity is a race and that you should be atheistic and cynical, and they don't know that you can win it, though, by joining with someone else in the second half of life.
3052880	3060880	I don't believe that monogamy is something that was not meant to be. I think that's something that was made up by Parshik's in Dubai.
3063880	3064880	Why?
3066880	3068880	I'm a racist guy.
3069880	3071880	Pat and Hannah, everybody. Pat and Hannah.
3072880	3074880	This work is work.
3075880	3077880	Thank you so much. Thank you very much.
3078880	3080880	Bless this union.
3081880	3082880	Thank you.
3084880	3092880	May your happiness increase over 250% using real inflation-adjusted real dollars.
3092880	3095880	Pat and Hannah. That's Hermitown's first wedding proposal on stage.
3102880	3106880	Sanctified by the mayor and by the senator from Vermont.
3107880	3112880	When I was mayor of Burlington, Vermont, there were some wild times back there.
3113880	3118880	I'm the first person to pronounce actually a marriage of four people who were just at a key party together.
3119880	3121880	That was simpler times.
3122880	3127880	I was direct tweeting with Pat before the show, and it was like, I'm so fucking nervous.
3128880	3132880	I don't tweet. Look, you should know this about me. Not only do I not tweet, I do not have an email server.
3133880	3136880	So there's no way that that could be the Hillary thing.
3137880	3145880	I have all of my communications printed out on a dot matrix printer and handed to me in a nice hemp-bound sort of ledger.
3146880	3153880	In the beginning of the pilot for the new Battlestar Galactica when Adama's giving the tour and going,
3154880	3158880	it's all vacuum tubes and none of it's hooked up to the internet because robots tried to murder us.
3159880	3164880	No, that's true. The program I actually saw, I watched it on VHS.
3165880	3170880	I do all my binge-washing on either VHS or if I can get it beta, but you can't always get it anymore.
3171880	3175880	And I watched, I did watch a little Battlestar Galactica and I find it inspirational.
3176880	3181880	If I'm elected president and there's not an immediate fascist coup d'etat that sort of takes me out of power,
3184880	3190880	I promise you that I will retrofit the United States military along the lines of Battlestar Galactica
3193880	3198880	so that it will not be connected to any sort of internet and it will also be suspenseful.
3198880	3199880	Hold on, it's every time.
3201880	3205880	First day in office. Your first day in office if you're elected president of the United States.
3206880	3207880	Thank you. What is the first?
3209880	3211880	I'm sorry, we should make it clear. He doesn't have that authority.
3212880	3213880	No, it's a hypothetical.
3214880	3218880	I think that everybody, look, I believe that everybody is, like Alan Watts says, you know,
3219880	3221880	a shining light that sort of gets to change the universe a little bit at a time.
3222880	3224880	So if he says it, I'm halfway there, you know?
3225880	3230880	Let's say your first day in office, what's the first piece of legislation you put into action,
3231880	3233880	your first 24 hours behind the Oval Office?
3234880	3239880	I think you're jumping the gun. If I may respectfully, Jeffrey, if I may respectfully disagree,
3240880	3244880	I don't think the first 24 hours in office are going to be spent passing any legislation.
3245880	3250880	I think it's going to be dedicated to a drum circle right in the Rose Garden.
3251880	3254880	We're getting people from Venice Beach, from Miami Beach.
3255880	3258880	We're getting all the best, ready? A worldwide drum circle.
3259880	3262880	They're going to be welcome, and we're going to throw that for, I don't know, we'll see until our palms get tired.
3263880	3264880	Will there be hacky-sacking? Will there be any hacky-sack?
3265880	3270880	There will be hacky-sacks. Look, you will be able to toss anything around at a small velocity off of your ankles.
3272880	3276880	Don't you think it's kind of, isn't it kind of weird from a strange cosmic objective standpoint
3276880	3279880	that it actually, that is your demographic.
3280880	3288880	That's how fucked up and weird our world is, is that the guy that looks the most like our dad,
3289880	3292880	the guy that... Hold on a second, look, I hope he's going to say something like that,
3293880	3296880	I need to respond, I don't look, I can't have an attack, hold my character like that.
3297880	3300880	If you're going to say that, I need to cite, as a reference, teach your children well,
3301880	3303880	the Crosby still is a national young song, that kind of dad, you know?
3304880	3305880	No, yeah, I do think it's...
3306880	3310880	Teach the children well, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
3311880	3312880	Holy gold, boy.
3313880	3315880	The archetypal of the clip-on tie rolled up sleeve...
3316880	3319880	So that would be counter-culture, no, that's not the typical...
3320880	3324880	I look like I'm made from crystallized college professor essence.
3327880	3332880	I look like I'm almost fueled by the mockery of children sitting in a college class,
3334880	3336880	someone compassionate all the drawings...
3337880	3341880	I'm well aware that I look like I'm running for president of The Muppet Show.
3346880	3350880	But I want to make something very clear, I feel like I'm very young.
3352880	3353880	Bernie, Bernie...
3354880	3355880	Why not?
3356880	3357880	Let's go. Again, I...
3358880	3359880	Crossfire time.
3359880	3363880	Let's say you, let's say you served two successful terms as president of the United States.
3364880	3365880	That's fantastic, the wolf.
3366880	3367880	Sixty-seven years from now.
3368880	3371880	Any statue that's made of me is going to be made of vegan macaroni,
3374880	3377880	condensed in a raw format using soy milk, soy milk,
3378880	3383880	into something that is a sustainable kind of statue that might wear down in the rain after about 50 years, but it'll look nice.
3384880	3388880	Now, there's talk of putting a woman, I believe, in the $10 bill,
3389880	3393880	what denomination of currency would you like to see yourself on?
3394880	3397880	Or, if not you, who else would you like to see on money in your place?
3398880	3399880	Look, that's a fine question.
3400880	3402880	I don't want my face on any currency.
3403880	3405880	I actually believe that the Federal Reserve should be audited.
3406880	3408880	I'm the only candidate saying that besides Rand Paul,
3409880	3411880	and he has as much of a chance as a buck and a piss.
3414880	3417880	I believe that the Federal Reserve should be audited, I think that's fair.
3418880	3422880	And so, I don't want my face on anything except social security checks that people receive.
3423880	3428880	Social security and Medicare checks, I want to have a big, just a birdy face that's like, there you are, you got it.
3429880	3438880	Senator, I'm sorry, I know how you interpret this, but they're asking me from the control room if you'll sit closer to me so that we both fit.
3439880	3440880	Was it a better stage picture? Who's complaining?
3441880	3442880	Who's complaining?
3443880	3444880	I think it's just corporate America.
3444880	3450880	You're streaming this online somewhere, and they're complaining, they're on there going, why isn't it better for me?
3451880	3455880	How come I have to either look at Senator Sanders or Dan Harmon, how come I can't look at both of them?
3456880	3457880	That's fair, that's fair.
3458880	3459880	Look, why not?
3460880	3461880	Do you want me to come down too?
3462880	3463880	Or do you want to come down too?
3464880	3465880	Or maybe we both move?
3466880	3468880	Or do you want to do like a chess move where we like Castle?
3469880	3472880	Let this be my official endorsement of you as a presidential candidate.
3472880	3473880	I'm going to come down to where you are.
3474880	3475880	That's fantastic.
3476880	3479880	And look, see, he moves too, and then like a rook, I just go around like this.
3482880	3483880	Chess you a mile.
3484880	3485880	Okay, all right.
3486880	3489880	Well, I think this is what people are afraid will happen metaphorically if we do elect you.
3490880	3493880	Everything will change, and then everything will just be different for no reason.
3494880	3495880	I am radically going to change everything.
3497880	3500880	Starting with the podcast, but look, see, it's comfortable.
3500880	3503880	Is this actually better, whoever said, is this okay?
3504880	3507880	Yes, see, this is a socialist solution, and you were shocked at first.
3508880	3510880	But then you got a thumbs up for the people of the both, it works.
3511880	3515880	All we need is the cooperation from most of the people in the room, and that's fine.
3516880	3519880	Why is everybody so upset about the socialism thing?
3520880	3522880	Are you on Adderall right now? What's going on?
3522880	3532880	I mean, I am on prescription Adderall that I got from Canada because it's easier to get drugs in Canada, which I don't think is fair for seniors.
3534880	3536880	Fine, with not a lot of seniors in the room, look.
3539880	3541880	Blah, blah, blah, Pearl Jam, is that better?
3544880	3546880	They love Pearl Jam.
3548880	3549880	I'm racking up some endorsements.
3549880	3554880	I know we're friends, I'm not going to push you or anything, but I am getting some endorsements.
3555880	3556880	You may have seen Jello Biafra.
3557880	3560880	That's not a joke, Jello Biafra endorsement.
3562880	3564880	Red Hot Chili Peppers, all of them, I got all of them.
3565880	3567880	They came into the office with the shirts off and everything.
3568880	3569880	Do you really have Jello?
3570880	3571880	Yep, Jello Biafra endorsement.
3572880	3575880	Also, Blind Melon is the first endorsement from Beyond the Grave.
3576880	3578880	I was endorsed by Blind Melon.
3580880	3584880	Speaking of that, so have you heard of this, is his name Paul Lessig?
3585880	3586880	Is that the name of the guy? Somebody tweeted me about that.
3587880	3588880	Yep, you know about Paul Lessig.
3589880	3595880	Look, and I don't want to get personal, but Paul Lessig, you know, he's warning a kid that they say that they don't have a protest candidate to see.
3596880	3600880	And all he wants to do is he wants to say we'll change the election laws and it'll resign.
3601880	3604880	But I think he wants you as his vice president so that you step back.
3605880	3608880	Sorry, pal, that ain't going to happen, all right? Birds on top.
3610880	3615880	I ain't taking second settle for nobody besides David Crosby, okay?
3617880	3620880	Look, look, Lawrence Lessig is saying he's going to run for president.
3621880	3624880	You know, if he's elected, he resigns after one day or whatever when he does his thing.
3625880	3629880	I think if he gets in, he becomes a Robespierre, guillotines, don't do it.
3630880	3634880	It has happened. I mean, what did we elect, Napoleon? And then he crowned himself.
3635880	3637880	I think we only wanted him to defend the best deal.
3637880	3639880	Actually, for like an afternoon.
3640880	3641880	It's important to notice.
3641880	3644880	We were like, yeah, and then you'll check out at five, and he's like, yeah, no problem, it's not going to blow.
3645880	3648880	And we're like, all right, I'm going to go to bed then, defend that best deal.
3649880	3652880	And then he's like, I hear cannons. Somebody invented a whiff of Grapeshot.
3653880	3661880	Look, that's not far off. It's not far off. I've actually studied the game Stratego, which is sort of based on Napoleon.
3662880	3664880	And that's, look, I studied it in detail.
3664880	3668880	I base all my stuff on the worst episodes of sliders.
3670880	3675880	All my history knowledge comes from CW sci-fi original to whatever.
3676880	3681880	I vividly remember the CBS miniseries, Napoleon and Josephine, starring Amanté, as Napoleon.
3682880	3687880	And I think when I engage, you know, the foreign policy out there, it's going to, you know.
3688880	3693880	Dan, what do you think Napoleon and his generals did wrong at Waterloo, and what do you think the repercussions of that were for France?
3694880	3700880	Well, I don't think, you know, I don't think they should have gone on the water, you know.
3701880	3704880	Cornwallis was out there, right, in boats.
3705880	3706880	That's close.
3706880	3707880	With Churchill.
3707880	3708880	Yeah.
3708880	3709880	That's like he was triangulated.
3710880	3712880	Between Cornwallis and Winston Churchill.
3712880	3713880	Yeah.
3713880	3715880	Speak softly and travel in time.
3717880	3722880	Was Winston Churchill's lesser-known saying, which turned out to be the real reason he has all the famous quotes.
3724880	3726880	Speak softly, was from whom?
3727880	3731880	Winston Churchill pretends that FDR said that.
3731880	3733880	You mean Teddy Roosevelt?
3733880	3736880	That's also another, depending on what timeline you're living in.
3739880	3742880	Winston Churchill, we're all, well, first of all, we're all white.
3744880	3750880	Fun fact, by the way, fun fact, I will be the first president since Teddy Roosevelt to wear glasses full-time.
3752880	3753880	Is that right?
3753880	3754880	Yep.
3754880	3757880	Look, part of the reason I'm running is for just little trivia things like that.
3758880	3762880	Also, the second president sends him to have been at Abe Lincoln's inauguration.
3762880	3763880	Come on, it's an old joke.
3763880	3764880	That's fair.
3764880	3765880	No.
3765880	3768880	I was at his first inauguration, not the second one.
3768880	3770880	I didn't, I wasn't supportive of that time.
3773880	3775880	So, okay, all right.
3775880	3776880	Socialism.
3776880	3777880	Yup.
3777880	3778880	Shirts.
3778880	3779880	Sure.
3779880	3780880	Ties.
3780880	3781880	Got it.
3781880	3782880	Sleeves.
3782880	3790880	I can't control it sometimes.
3790880	3791880	It just does this.
3791880	3793880	You didn't orchestrate 9-11, did you?
3794880	3795880	Nope.
3795880	3796880	I did.
3796880	3797880	Nope.
3797880	3798880	I certainly did not.
3798880	3799880	That was, you know, the other guys.
3799880	3800880	I thought you were blessing us.
3800880	3801880	I thought you were giving us, like, absolution.
3801880	3802880	Sure, yeah.
3802880	3808880	But all it does is raises your contribution to Social Security funds a little bit.
3809880	3810880	That's how you use your...
3811880	3812880	I lower your taxes in the hour.
3812880	3815880	Just to lower our taxes or raise them.
3815880	3820880	I always, yeah, I mean, like, like how much, how much, you saw that documentary and said
3820880	3822880	we only need $75,000 a year to be happy.
3822880	3825880	And then beyond that, we're already happy and it doesn't fucking matter.
3825880	3827880	Rich people aren't happier than poor people.
3827880	3832880	Look, I'd be a little confused because I have watched every documentary on Netflix.
3834880	3839880	I, not only have I watched every documentary on Netflix and I, and that's it.
3839880	3840880	I have them printed out.
3840880	3847880	I have, I don't believe in using email service, so I have Netflix programs printed out and
3847880	3850880	I have them fanned like a little carpool book.
3851880	3853880	And that's how I watch every program.
3853880	3857880	And then I have staffers read the parts and they just, they read them, you know, like
3857880	3859880	you're sitting around reading Shakespeare or something.
3863880	3865880	But you haven't seen the one I'm talking about.
3865880	3868880	I don't, look, I just go along with my informational to the Netflix service.
3868880	3872880	So what I do is I print it out like you're watching, you know, steamboat Willie, like
3872880	3873880	you were talking about earlier.
3874880	3877880	There's a kind of, obviously you would agree with this because you know, there's
3877880	3879880	some kind of pop science kind of thing.
3879880	3883880	It's, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, there's been studies put into, but how
3883880	3887880	scientifically studies be the idea that there is a cap, an absolute cap on the
3887880	3892880	amount of like wealth that, that by, that actually does impact your emotional
3892880	3897880	state and that beyond a certain amount and it's a relative to, let's say,
3897880	3903880	whatever year this, this, this study was done and in American dollars that it
3903880	3908880	equivalates, is that a word to a $75,000 a year salary?
3908880	3909880	I don't know about that.
3909880	3911880	You're not going to be getting, you're not going to get happier.
3911880	3912880	You're going to have more money.
3912880	3913880	You're going to have a bidet at some point.
3913880	3916880	You're going to look, but you're not going to get happier.
3916880	3918880	It is my belief.
3918880	3924880	It is my firm belief that I'm not here to tell people how much money they should
3924880	3925880	make. I'm not a communist.
3925880	3926880	I want to make that clear.
3926880	3927880	I'm a socialist.
3927880	3931880	I don't, it's not my job to go, go, you know, open up your checkbook.
3931880	3932880	I can say that's too much.
3932880	3935880	You have not enough at all, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
3935880	3938880	That would be an amazing cereal commercial though.
3938880	3941880	If you were thinking, look, I got those for you.
3941880	3943880	You're eating cereal and then you come in and go, oh yeah.
3943880	3945880	All right, kids, you shouldn't have that much.
3945880	3946880	You should have this much.
3946880	3948880	Look, that's fine, but I won't take any money for the commercial.
3948880	3952880	And also the only cereal I endorse is cashing.
3952880	3958880	But I don't want to say, look, I think if there's an appropriate amount of
3958880	3963880	money that somebody should have, I don't think it begins with a B as in billion.
3963880	3966880	You know what I'm talking about?
3966880	3970880	And I think if you are making billions of dollars, I think that you should pay
3970880	3974880	something in taxes, you cheapskate bastards.
3974880	3976880	By the way, I want to point this out.
3976880	3978880	I'm looking forward to the general election.
3978880	3985880	I think that me versus Donald Trump is the best possible election you could have.
3985880	3990880	Look, if we do it, I want to have at least four debates in each region of the
3990880	3991880	country.
3991880	4000880	And I also want to have a debate between just our hair as a tiebreaker.
4000880	4002880	That would be amazing.
4002880	4004880	By the way, he's from Queens, you know that.
4004880	4005880	And I'm from Brooklyn.
4005880	4006880	Oh, shit.
4007880	4010880	Look, it's like Oklahoma and Texas and New York.
4010880	4016880	I do have a plan, by the way, with mentioning Texas as a side note.
4016880	4020880	I think for global warming, I think my solution is I want to turn Texas into a
4020880	4021880	rainforest.
4024880	4030880	Because all of those sad statistics and things talk, they always use Texas as a size
4030880	4031880	scale.
4031880	4032880	Sure, they reference it as a bigger size.
4032880	4033880	Why not?
4033880	4034880	Just go for it.
4035880	4036880	We know how much we need.
4036880	4038880	If you need Austin, we can have it cleared out.
4038880	4040880	And then the rest of us just rainforest.
4042880	4046880	But look, if we're having an election, a Queens, Brooklyn election, I'm calling
4046880	4048880	this the G train election.
4049880	4052880	It's going to be a New York bit by Coastal enough.
4052880	4054880	Look, I'm going there in a couple of weeks.
4054880	4056880	I got a prep for the material.
4058880	4061880	It's going to be long, winding, hot and too expensive.
4061880	4062880	And it'll break down.
4062880	4065880	But eventually, you know, you got stuck in the middle of the East River.
4067880	4068880	The G train.
4069880	4070880	Just like the G train.
4070880	4071880	Yup.
4071880	4072880	That's the best I could call it.
4072880	4073880	What do you want, the PQE?
4073880	4074880	I don't know.
4075880	4078880	I still say Houston street.
4080880	4081880	Oh, you're lucky.
4081880	4083880	I'm not a fighter anymore.
4084880	4085880	Wow.
4085880	4086880	That's right.
4086880	4087880	You were golden gloves when you were younger, right?
4087880	4089880	Look, I used to do Muay Thai.
4092880	4093880	I played rugby.
4093880	4094880	I was really vicious.
4094880	4098880	So the front, you know, scrum is bare knuckle.
4098880	4101880	We like I'm just a brutal like I even test the rules.
4101880	4105880	Just how hard I would fight by the I bet a guy we won.
4106880	4107880	You bet a guy in one.
4107880	4108880	Yeah.
4108880	4110880	This was back when I was at the University of Chicago.
4112880	4114880	Why did that make you laugh?
4115880	4117880	Because it's actually true.
4117880	4120880	And I'm impressed with myself that I remember exactly.
4121880	4124880	I went to college because it was in the middle of the late 1960s.
4124880	4127880	And I am lucky I remember any of it.
4128880	4132880	There's a vague haze of LSD and Tom Hayden.
4132880	4134880	That's all I can kind of remember.
4135880	4136880	So all right.
4136880	4139880	Well, look, look, let's Jeff has checked out.
4139880	4140880	That's fine.
4140880	4141880	No, no, no.
4141880	4142880	That's it.
4142880	4145880	Like like let's let's let's put this like let's get this to eight year old level.
4145880	4146880	Okay.
4146880	4149880	So like because here's what's going to happen in the election.
4150880	4151880	Okay.
4151880	4153880	Because I've been through this a thousand times already.
4153880	4155880	That's those numbers are inflated.
4155880	4161880	It's the number of years I voted are not 25% of the 90% of what I just said.
4161880	4163880	But I feel like you have a vote.
4163880	4171880	I voted every I think there's only a couple elections where I was so fucking like just just just over it that I didn't vote and didn't talk to anybody about it.
4171880	4172880	Sure.
4172880	4178880	Those are those were because as I've said on the show, the reason the real reason I vote is because I want to continue to have a political opinion.
4178880	4180880	And we have an entrenched thing in this.
4180880	4186880	So you can't you're not allowed to talk about breaking out of this the way that things work.
4186880	4189880	People are voting for voting for voting for voting for voting for voting.
4189880	4197880	They're voting for they're voting for faith in the way the system has worked, which is a system that eighty seven percent of everybody doesn't believe in.
4197880	4200880	You know, I sat down with Yoko Ora when she said the same thing.
4201880	4202880	Good.
4202880	4207880	Well, as that's Dan right now, if you if Election Day was tomorrow, who would you vote for?
4207880	4208880	Or would you vote? And if so, who?
4208880	4209880	I'm going to go.
4212880	4213880	I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to vote for Bernie Sanders.
4213880	4218880	And I wish that everybody that voted voted their conscience because I don't think this is I think the problem.
4218880	4220880	And I think this is actually goes beyond like.
4222880	4223880	Yeah, I did.
4223880	4224880	I did.
4225880	4236880	I think I feel like it goes beyond when you would talk about America because you could explain American politics in a really easy way, which is just like, you know, we keep talking about how broke we are and how in trouble we are.
4236880	4245880	But but until that really becomes a definable real thing where the fact is that we're still rich and we're still find the way things are like like.
4245880	4251880	And so we're going to continue to kind of do this like like like like like think the way we did it last time.
4251880	4260880	However, something we're going to look at, I do think it's something we're going to look at the idea that the country itself, you could vote for anybody you want to just vote if you want to vote for the Queen of England.
4260880	4261880	Go for it.
4261880	4266880	I want the country to be more like a Tumblr post that you see late at night.
4266880	4267880	Yeah.
4267880	4273880	Where there's some sort of pyramid floating on a planet and there's, you know, there's just sort of an ancient wisdom that's guiding us.
4273880	4275880	I think that's what I want to work towards.
4275880	4276880	Bernie.
4276880	4278880	Let's say you weren't running.
4278880	4280880	Who would you vote for if you weren't a candidate?
4280880	4282880	If I wasn't running for president, who would I vote for?
4282880	4283880	Yeah.
4283880	4285880	Well, look, I would probably vote for Stevie Dix.
4285880	4289880	I think it's time for a woman president.
4289880	4291880	That's who I would go for.
4291880	4293880	But do you think she's tough enough on immigration?
4293880	4300880	Look, I think I've seen her kick people out of our house when we used to party at the Panga Canyon.
4300880	4309880	And believe me, believe me, she knows how to elegantly get somebody out of the foyer where they've had a little bit too much in the mirror.
4309880	4310880	Thank you.
4310880	4314880	That's good for people.
4314880	4320880	I predict a landslide.
4320880	4324880	Anyways, the I had to fucking had to.
4324880	4330880	It was like a fucking you had to like it's like an L.A. story when the when she has to like do the rest of shaving a haircut on her tuba.
4330880	4333880	It's like a fucking dumbass fucking pun.
4333880	4334880	The landslide.
4334880	4337880	It was a Fleetwood Max.
4337880	4338880	But wait, wait, wait.
4338880	4340880	I just want to not because I think it's important.
4340880	4343880	It's going to benefit them because it's in my fucking head and I have some problems.
4343880	4346880	There must be some like like like like I want people like this to have a forum.
4346880	4347880	Go ahead.
4347880	4359880	The the the there must be like some like there's I bet there's somebody in the audience that's like studying this or knows I've read a book about this or something like there.
4359880	4363880	It must be some some there's this this thing every time we have our elections every year.
4363880	4372880	There's this principle that that keeps coming into into into the four where people they they the idea of voting.
4372880	4373880	Sure.
4373880	4374880	Can I think about it?
4374880	4375880	Elections.
4375880	4377880	I'm going.
4377880	4378880	No, I look.
4378880	4379880	Look, we rolled up our sleeves.
4379880	4381880	We're having a little policy.
4381880	4382880	Walk out.
4382880	4383880	Let's go for it.
4383880	4389880	They don't want to vote that just to express as a natural part of the process.
4389880	4393880	They don't want to just be a part of of a total tally.
4393880	4399880	And then we think like we we all want to vote for the winner.
4399880	4404880	We don't want to be part of the problem by voting for the wrong person.
4404880	4410880	And when we have third party candidates, it becomes a huge problem because not only do you have people not wanting to vote for the third party candidate.
4410880	4411880	Go ahead.
4411880	4414880	But like I think you're like an eighth party candidate.
4414880	4417880	The the I have been in the past.
4417880	4422880	Yes, I read for the peace and freedom party and I actually split at the peace and freedom party.
4422880	4423880	I was oh my God.
4423880	4428880	See, I was on the freedom side of the peace people we didn't get along with.
4428880	4432880	And I think I've ranted about remember when Nader was it was it was running and it was like this thing.
4432880	4433880	It was like that big election.
4433880	4438880	It was like, oh, the culture wars are at their peak because we had no fucking real problems yet at all.
4438880	4443880	So all anybody wanted to talk about is how fucking important it was where this guy or that guy got elected.
4443880	4445880	And it was like so fucking important to everybody.
4445880	4448880	I'm not saying like I think what was that Gore versus Vader?
4448880	4452880	What was the it was Gore versus Palpatine.
4452880	4458880	But it was like so so so I do understand it was important for so many so so many small reasons.
4458880	4466880	By the way, I want to say just really quickly that the political message of the second of the latest trilogy of the Star Wars movies is a little thick.
4466880	4468880	It's laid on a little thick, but I think it is accurate.
4468880	4471880	I think the Bush administration is a lot like the Emperor.
4471880	4481880	Those people, those journalists who are like reporting from the Ralph Nader campaign headquarters where this is a guy who knew he was going to lose.
4481880	4483880	It was important for him to run.
4483880	4487880	It was important to the people that were supporting him that they was running journalists.
4487880	4489880	I know Ralph. He was. Look, he was. He thought he was going to win.
4489880	4494880	Yeah, he bought the balloons.
4494880	4496880	End of story.
4496880	4498880	He was a lot of balloons and they couldn't release them up.
4498880	4500880	They had to get rid of them.
4500880	4503880	There's nothing sadder that getting rid of a bunch of balloons.
4503880	4505880	The quiet way, Mr. Sanders.
4505880	4508880	How early how early does a candidate have to buy those balloons?
4508880	4515880	You have to buy them. You can't buy them like two days before you legally, according to the Federal Election Commission, the FCC.
4515880	4517880	Yes, there's a certain you have to have.
4517880	4522880	You have to report every balloon you receive as a donation.
4522880	4530880	And also, whether it was helium or regular air or some other sort of gas that might be poisonous in a rare case or a water balloon.
4530880	4535880	You have to, of course, go to the Department of Interior because we're in the midst of an epic drought.
4535880	4541880	I am trying to help solve by the volume of sweat that's coming out.
4541880	4546880	When I'm in California, I deliberately perspire more.
4546880	4547880	Thank you.
4547880	4550880	In order to help refill Lake Powell.
4550880	4553880	That is saltwater, though. We have a whole ocean of that.
4553880	4557880	Trust me. Trust me. This is like Salt Lake, baby.
4557880	4562880	But the guy the guy on the floor at the route, the journalists, like, like, like, well, the campaign is going on.
4562880	4565880	So they got like so were because everyone was watching.
4565880	4570880	Everybody that wanted either Bush or Gore, whoever the fuck was running against who, Mothra and Gamera, they were running against each other.
4570880	4574880	And everyone was on the edge of their seats because it was a fucking barn burner.
4574880	4575880	That's not the right metaphor.
4575880	4580880	It was a hair splitter. It was a fucking turtle fucker.
4580880	4589880	Their turtle vaginas are like they're they're they're bifurcated with a very thin membrane.
4589880	4591880	It was a it was a candle burner.
4591880	4595880	Male turtles have a two pronged like it's like a tuning fork.
4595880	4599880	And I'll put a pin in that.
4599880	4600880	But they got there.
4600880	4603880	I think it's time that we hear from the female turtles frankly.
4603880	4604880	But go ahead.
4604880	4606880	Well, that's that's the news from Florida.
4606880	4607880	That's it.
4607880	4608880	And we've got the numbers up here.
4608880	4609880	We got Will.
4609880	4612880	I am and it has a hologram and he's coming in and all this stuff.
4612880	4613880	And let's go.
4613880	4616880	And everyone was like it was like this is fucking crazy.
4616880	4620880	I guess this is before like like like it was it was like weird that journalism was dead.
4620880	4626880	But it was like they were like it was fucking crazy to me because they were like that's when my spirit really fucking died.
4626880	4627880	I didn't vote for Ralph Nader.
4627880	4633880	But watching the coverage, I was like they were like, well, we now we.
4633880	4636880	So that's that's the news from that fucking neck and neck race.
4636880	4639880	And well, you keep hearing his name.
4639880	4643880	And he is, of course, the reason why this is his neck and neck.
4643880	4648880	We now go to Nancy Johnson, who's over at Ralph Nader headquarters.
4648880	4651880	Head shake, head shake, head shake.
4651880	4652880	Nancy.
4652880	4656880	And there was like and she cuts it and Nancy's like, yeah.
4656880	4657880	Yeah.
4657880	4661880	They're thrilled down here.
4661880	4667880	Because all the unspoken things that everyone was saying was like, if you voted for Nader, you're voting for Bush.
4667880	4670880	You're voting because he's splitting the vote.
4670880	4672880	This isn't this is insane.
4672880	4674880	This isn't that's not democracy.
4674880	4675880	Right.
4675880	4676880	The idea of a fair ballot.
4676880	4681880	Well, focusing on the outcome and then backing into your behavior as an end user.
4681880	4682880	That's our fucking disease.
4682880	4690880	I firmly believe that we should have a Scandinavian style system in a lot of ways, not only the way we tax corporations,
4690880	4692880	but also elections, multiple parties.
4692880	4698880	I want to have a WikiLeaks party where you bring Assange back.
4698880	4702880	Those crazy pirate parties they have up in Sweden and all that stuff.
4702880	4707880	I want I want to make sure that we have a fantastic array of different choices.
4707880	4708880	You have like a nice buffet.
4708880	4715880	If you want to vote for like like a nice little fishy eggy breakfast thing, you can go ahead and vote for it.
4715880	4718880	Fantastic breakfast in Scandinavia, by the way, to go with me.
4718880	4719880	You'll find out.
4719880	4720880	Trust me.
4720880	4723880	But also, I think, you know, just have a little democratic system like that.
4723880	4727880	And if you want to have, you know, play fun and games, you do a little girl dragon tattoo thing.
4727880	4731880	You know, you can still keep that up for all the guys who want to do the bad stuff.
4731880	4734880	We can have a little tag dragon tattoo game for you.
4734880	4735880	Yeah.
4735880	4740880	I mean, it's democracy, a parliamentary system.
4740880	4741880	That the hold on a second.
4741880	4742880	There's a parliamentary system.
4742880	4743880	Yeah, that's a good.
4743880	4744880	Who is that?
4744880	4745880	That's that's John.
4745880	4746880	That's my policy.
4746880	4747880	That's my policy advice.
4748880	4749880	Thank you.
4749880	4750880	Good.
4750880	4751880	Yeah.
4751880	4752880	Oh, what about the idea?
4752880	4753880	Yeah.
4753880	4758880	Whenever we talk about the system being broken and how it's not a true democracy, then there's people who say, well, it's supposed to be a republic.
4758880	4759880	What do those people mean?
4759880	4761880	Do they mean they want it to be a republic?
4761880	4763880	Or do they mean that it works better as a republic?
4763880	4764880	Those are people.
4764880	4768880	Those are the same people that say whom when you say who.
4768880	4771880	Those are the same assholes that go what?
4771880	4773880	Well, you can't understand what's with the preposition.
4773880	4776880	That's how people talk, motherfuckers.
4777880	4779880	A republic.
4779880	4781880	Republic means for the people.
4781880	4785880	Democracy means the rule, the rule of the power is in the people.
4785880	4786880	It's close enough.
4786880	4787880	Forget it.
4787880	4788880	What are you?
4788880	4789880	What am I?
4789880	4790880	What am I?
4790880	4791880	What am I?
4791880	4794880	What am I supposed to read the back of an old time old timey dollar bill or something?
4794880	4797880	What are you, a broad sheet from the days of what am I?
4797880	4798880	What am I?
4798880	4799880	What am I, Martin Van Buren?
4799880	4802880	I do look a lot like Martin Van Buren.
4803880	4808880	Spencer, if you could pick a governmental system from anywhere throughout history,
4808880	4811880	what do you think would be the most just and the most simple?
4811880	4816880	Currently or like what we have now or something at any part of history?
4816880	4817880	Oh, man.
4817880	4818880	Let me tell you something.
4818880	4821880	Let me tell you something about fiefdoms.
4823880	4824880	They really, you know.
4824880	4825880	You want to bring the fiefdom back?
4825880	4826880	They really did it.
4826880	4827880	They made it happen.
4827880	4828880	You know, you had castles.
4828880	4830880	You had knights and shit.
4830880	4831880	There was serfs.
4831880	4834880	It's all the things you want out of society.
4834880	4836880	Unless you're a serf.
4836880	4838880	Actually, they're probably pretty happy.
4838880	4842880	It is attractive when you do open up that Lego knight set
4842880	4844880	and you got the little guy with the rounded sword.
4844880	4845880	Yeah, there's dragons.
4845880	4846880	It's not going to hurt the body.
4846880	4848880	It's a rounded sword.
4848880	4850880	But look, something gets out of order.
4850880	4852880	You lose a Lego here or there.
4852880	4853880	It's ugly.
4853880	4854880	Then suddenly, wham.
4854880	4855880	Braveheart.
4855880	4857880	Or worse, you know, like.
4857880	4859880	I'm trying to remember my tenth grade history.
4859880	4861880	So it's like Holy Roman Empire.
4861880	4865880	Does that break into feudal Europe?
4865880	4867880	You know what they say about the Holy Roman Empire, right?
4867880	4871880	Neither Holy nor Roman, nor interesting in any way.
4873880	4875880	I think after the fall of Rome, it went into the Dark Ages
4875880	4877880	for a while, didn't it?
4877880	4878880	That's one of the things.
4878880	4879880	Well, there was...
4879880	4880880	Yeah, yeah.
4880880	4882880	I have no...
4882880	4884880	I shamelessly say I don't fucking know.
4884880	4886880	But I also, like, I guess it would be weird
4886880	4888880	to make people listen to all of us not know.
4888880	4889880	Well, no, I don't know.
4889880	4890880	Hold on a second.
4890880	4891880	And I want to...
4891880	4893880	I don't yield my time just yet.
4893880	4897880	If the senator would yield, I just think that of 30 seconds here,
4897880	4901880	I think there is a danger that the analogy has been made before
4901880	4904880	that we are repeating, you know, the mistakes of the Roman Empire.
4904880	4905880	I'm not the first to say something like that.
4905880	4907880	Oh, because all roads are leading somewhere.
4907880	4908880	Sure.
4908880	4910880	All roads or whatever on the back of a horse.
4910880	4912880	You know, you got the email with multiple colors.
4912880	4913880	You get it.
4914880	4916880	Your mother, your dad sent you an email.
4916880	4917880	That's what I'm talking about.
4918880	4920880	We're an empire that's in its decline
4920880	4922880	in the same way that the Roman Empire declined.
4922880	4926880	So my solution, if we are truly facing a dark ages,
4926880	4928880	is to make sure that we have enough
4928880	4930880	solar-powered stationary bicycles
4930880	4934880	to at least have a little bit of light during those dark ages.
4934880	4936880	Yeah, yeah, we should stock up.
4936880	4937880	We should plan for it, you know.
4937880	4939880	We should plan for the dark ages.
4939880	4942880	Look, have some candles in the drawer.
4943880	4946880	Make sure you got extra batteries or whatever.
4946880	4948880	Just, you know, be safe.
4949880	4950880	All right.
4950880	4952880	Is Demortch here?
4952880	4953880	Oh.
4953880	4955880	He made a stand.
4955880	4957880	You know, we always expect him to be here,
4957880	4958880	and he's like, what if I wasn't?
4958880	4960880	He said it because Arsenal lost again.
4960880	4961880	Oh.
4964880	4966880	Oh, they soccer in particular.
4966880	4967880	They did? That's too bad.
4967880	4968880	That's too bad.
4968880	4970880	Well, I think you're going to have to stay up here
4970880	4973880	and play Shadow Run with us, Senator Sanders.
4973880	4975880	Hold on a second.
4975880	4976880	Hold on a second.
4976880	4979880	Let me consult with my campaign manager.
4979880	4980880	We had another event.
4980880	4983880	I was scheduled to go be interrupted by protesters
4983880	4985880	who I agree with completely.
4985880	4987880	Let me see real quick.
4987880	4988880	Hold on a second.
4988880	4989880	Let me just ask if there's...
4989880	4990880	Strange.
4991880	4992880	I'm available.
4992880	4993880	I'm available.
4995880	4998880	This is more airtime than I've gotten
4998880	5000880	in the last three months on CNN.
5000880	5001880	All right.
5001880	5002880	Now, Bernie Sanders,
5002880	5005880	have you ever played a fantasy role-playing game before?
5005880	5006880	Sure.
5006880	5007880	Yes.
5007880	5009880	I mean, yes, I have.
5009880	5011880	I've never had the Dungeon Master.
5011880	5013880	I didn't like the, you know,
5013880	5015880	I didn't like the idea of a dungeon,
5015880	5017880	a hierarchical Dungeon Master
5017880	5020880	that sounds too much like corporate power to me.
5021880	5022880	But let me put it this way.
5022880	5026880	I have played Meeples that I became very attached to.
5027880	5028880	Meeples.
5028880	5029880	So there's like a pair of whatever you want.
5029880	5031880	I played, look, right here or there.
5031880	5032880	What character...
5032880	5035880	If you had to choose a mythological character
5035880	5037880	to portray in a fantasy realm,
5037880	5038880	what kind of character would it be?
5038880	5040880	Look, I think that I would be...
5040880	5042880	Look, I don't want to say a troll,
5042880	5047880	but I do want to say that I would obstruct certain areas
5047880	5052880	where powerful feudal lords were trying to cross a bridge
5052880	5053880	or something, and I would say,
5053880	5055880	hey, stop, but it would be more like
5055880	5057880	you've got to look at the statistics,
5057880	5060880	and I would make sure they pay the fare.
5060880	5063880	It's not like a magical, you can't cross...
5063880	5065880	The game that we're playing is actually set in the future,
5065880	5067880	so it's more of a kind of a dystopian, kind of, you know,
5067880	5070880	like 1984, Raven the World kind of thing.
5070880	5072880	Got it. I'm Chewbacca.
5073880	5074880	Okay.
5074880	5078880	Imagine Star Wars where instead of moaning every ten seconds,
5078880	5079880	it's...
5081880	5083880	Well, give me some Star Wars.
5083880	5085880	Chewie, hand me the Hydro Spanner.
5085880	5090880	One percent, a five percent of the top hydro spans
5090880	5092880	are controlled by the Imperial Council,
5092880	5093880	and I don't think that's fair.
5093880	5094880	That is what I call it.
5095880	5097880	Punch it, Chewie. Punch it.
5098880	5099880	Punch it, Chewie.
5100880	5102880	We're ahead of New Hampshire, we're ahead of Iowa.
5102880	5104880	Let's see how far we can take it.
5108880	5112880	Somebody in this audience will take a scene from Star Wars
5112880	5116880	and subtitle Chewie's Growls with Bernie Sanders.
5119880	5120880	That will be funny.
5121880	5122880	Laugh it up, first of all.
5122880	5123880	We will be teaming.
5123880	5126880	I believe that every American who works,
5126880	5128880	deserves a paycheck and a chance
5128880	5130880	on a fair shot of the American dream.
5132880	5133880	Was that too long?
5133880	5137880	Look, if we do ADR, you come in and I wait for the beep beep beep
5137880	5141880	and I time it out so I can match the actual picture.
5141880	5145880	Bernie Sanders, at the end of the Star Wars episode four,
5145880	5147880	when they're all getting their awards,
5147880	5149880	the awards ceremony at the end of it,
5149880	5151880	and the music is playing and they all get up there
5151880	5154880	and Han gets his medal and they cut the Chewie.
5160880	5162880	I think it was a different song playing,
5162880	5164880	but they cut the Chewie and Chewie.
5171880	5176880	Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
5176880	5177880	Was that Chewie?
5177880	5179880	No, it was just Bernie Sanders.
5179880	5182880	He loves the Star Wars theme, is it?
5182880	5186880	It's could not have been done without all of you, Rebel Alliance.
5186880	5189880	It puts a revolution in, here it is.
5190880	5191880	Thank you.
5192880	5195880	That's all I want, just get me into the desktop.
5195880	5199880	Is it too no pun intended pat of me?
5199880	5204880	To say, why don't we just, since we need a Mercy O'Donnell and a, and a, and a, and a,
5204880	5208880	and we don't have Aaron or Demorridge, we don't want to just bring up our happy couple and have them play.
5208880	5211880	Pat and Hannah, do you want to join us for some, for some shadow run?
5211880	5214880	Pat and Hannah, return to the stage.
5215880	5219880	You guys have to sit on either, you have to bookend me and the senator.
5220880	5225880	Because, because that's part of the challenge of your new life together,
5225880	5227880	is that you have to be autonomous as well.
5227880	5230880	It's called interdependence as opposed to co-dependence.
5234880	5236880	And that's a big one.
5236880	5239880	Pat, Hannah, do you live in Los Angeles?
5239880	5241880	No, New Hampshire.
5241880	5242880	Oh, New Hampshire.
5242880	5245880	You're going to call that home? Are you going to stay in New Hampshire?
5245880	5250880	Until I get, well, until I get a full-time job at the news station
5250880	5254880	and then work there for a year or two and kind of look around the country.
5254880	5255880	See where it takes you?
5255880	5256880	Yeah.
5256880	5257880	That's cool.
5257880	5260880	What is your foretag at the news?
5260880	5264880	What are your local budgetary issues?
5264880	5268880	Local interest, budgetary, financial, fiscal?
5268880	5269880	All of those things.
5269880	5272880	Fiduciary, sports-related angles?
5272880	5276880	All of the, I'm training to be a director.
5276880	5277880	A news director.
5277880	5279880	Fair enough, fair enough.
5279880	5281880	Not glam up behind the camera, good, working.
5281880	5283880	Did you like Nightcrawler?
5283880	5285880	I fucking loved Nightcrawler.
5285880	5286880	Wait a minute, hold on a second.
5286880	5287880	Are those documents? Hold on.
5287880	5289880	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
5289880	5291880	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
5291880	5293880	All nice, all good. Let's see what we have.
5293880	5296880	I thought that was such a fun character for Gyllenhaal.
5296880	5298880	I really like that.
5298880	5303880	I kept falling asleep during Nightcrawler and I kept watching it over and over again
5303880	5305880	to try to get to the end because I'm like,
5305880	5307880	oh, the movie's kind of a, you know, whatever.
5307880	5309880	But I really like that character.
5309880	5310880	Yeah, he's a great character.
5310880	5311880	I just like that when the guy goes like,
5311880	5312880	I'm not going to hire a thief.
5312880	5317880	And he goes like, he goes, fair enough.
5317880	5321880	And you're like, oh, my God, he's a fucking murderer or whatever.
5321880	5324880	Like, it's great. I love that.
5324880	5326880	You know, the heart, I have a little anecdote.
5326880	5329880	I have a little fun anecdote, like a little Peter Rabbit tale now.
5329880	5334880	And then I was on an airplane and I was trying to watch the Tom Cruise movie
5334880	5338880	with the robot, with the, you know, the robots.
5339880	5341880	Yeah, I realized there's a lot of them.
5341880	5343880	But Edge of Tomorrow, that one.
5343880	5344880	Mine was a bit.
5344880	5348880	And they kept coming, they kept coming on with, you know,
5348880	5350880	the announcements interrupting the picture.
5350880	5352880	And then you lose where you were in the movie.
5352880	5354880	And I was trying to rewind Edge of Tomorrow to go,
5354880	5357880	hey, let me watch where I left off from.
5357880	5361880	And it's impossible to rewind to the same place where you were watching it from
5361880	5363880	because the whole movie is rewinding and shit.
5363880	5364880	Right, right.
5365880	5369880	If I am elected president, I will burn that movie in every copy of it.
5371880	5375880	Or at least make them do it again with an honest linear plot.
5375880	5378880	Or at least just rewrite it, or just make an edit of it
5378880	5381880	so that every time Tom Cruise wakes up in that pile of luggage,
5381880	5384880	he looks at the camera and goes, four times.
5386880	5387880	That would help me.
5387880	5390880	Some numbers, just like, you know, an x-axis and a y-axis.
5390880	5392880	Just put it in there.
5393880	5395880	Euclidean geometry, what's wrong with that?
5395880	5397880	Where did we go so wrong?
5397880	5399880	Do you like Euclidean geometry, Hannah?
5399880	5401880	Obviously.
5402880	5404880	I mean, it's proven.
5404880	5406880	Very good, very good.
5406880	5409880	I'm on fire with the fucking dumbass puns tonight.
5409880	5411880	Zeg?
5411880	5415880	I've turned into the grandpa I never had.
5415880	5417880	Tell me about it.
5419880	5421880	How old are you, Mr. Sanders?
5421880	5424880	It's confidential national security.
5424880	5427880	It's actually state security information in the state of Vermont.
5427880	5431880	It's one of the few secrets that we have in the Vermont Secret Service.
5431880	5433880	How old I am?
5433880	5436880	90% of the time you've been on this earth,
5436880	5440880	10% of the people that are still alive have seen 5% of the people die.
5440880	5443880	Right. Let's put it this way.
5443880	5447880	When we look at how we're depleting the resources on the planet
5447880	5450880	and we're wondering, hey, maybe the resources will last a little longer.
5450880	5452880	Trust me, they won't.
5452880	5454880	I go back to the Permian.
5454880	5456880	Well, that's too far.
5456880	5458880	Crustaceous, whatever you want.
5458880	5460880	Crustaceous, the crustaceous.
5460880	5464880	Because you're saying you were around when oil was still dinosaurs
5464880	5466880	and that didn't last.
5466880	5468880	Or, you know, the pink Hitler or whatever that was.
5468880	5469880	I was there.
5469880	5470880	Whatever that was.
5470880	5472880	It was citizen fucking Kane is what it was.
5472880	5475880	I'll joke all about a lot of shit, but that was my fucking idea
5475880	5477880	and it was great.
5477880	5479880	It's not far off from the way things off.
5479880	5480880	This guy.
5480880	5482880	I'm going to answer that question you had.
5482880	5484880	There's good answers, certainly.
5484880	5485880	You're a good answer.
5485880	5487880	Thanks, man. That's very nice.
5487880	5488880	Sorry, I'm sorry.
5488880	5490880	All perversal statements tonight.
5490880	5493880	Spencer, are you ready to recap the last Shadowrun we played?
5493880	5496880	I'm ready for any number of eventualities.
5496880	5497880	Do we have a guest?
5497880	5501880	Do we have a guest Shadowrun summarizer?
5501880	5503880	Yeah, Jason Clymer.
5503880	5504880	Jason Clymer?
5504880	5506880	Or Clymer, probably Clymer.
5506880	5507880	All right, let's find out.
5507880	5508880	Are you ready to rock?
5508880	5510880	I don't think we will find out.
5510880	5512880	Are we voting?
5512880	5515880	Am I up?
5515880	5517880	I abstain.
5517880	5519880	The senator from the vote stands.
5519880	5521880	His first question was, are we voting?
5521880	5523880	His second was, I abstain.
5523880	5526880	I would like to filibuster.
5526880	5529880	I would like to filibuster the vote.
5529880	5533880	I do not think it's responsible to hold the vote on an issue.
5533880	5535880	Am I on a start?
5535880	5537880	No, I like this.
5537880	5543880	Well, because also contractually, we can't play anything with too much medieval stuff in it,
5543880	5546880	and we also can't do it for more than 10 minutes, technically,
5546880	5551880	according to our contracts during render of services on our own.
5551880	5554880	I think we'll find that if you have 19 minutes from now,
5554880	5556880	we will have played four minutes of gameplay.
5556880	5560880	I'm pretty sure that people that are worried about that will,
5560880	5564880	oh, oh, oh, but also contractually, which I think is a great fucking idea,
5564880	5566880	I am supposed to say.
5566880	5569880	HarmonQuest, coming soon to see so.
5569880	5572880	It's going to be a new thing, and we'll be plugging in.
5572880	5574880	We've had six tapings so far, right?
5574880	5577880	Has anybody gone to the HarmonQuest tapings?
5577880	5578880	You guys have been there?
5578880	5579880	You should come.
5579880	5580880	You should come to Monday or Tuesday.
5580880	5582880	We still have empty seats.
5582880	5585880	It would be great if, you know, we rang in the,
5585880	5588880	I was going to say New Year, but it's not really that.
5588880	5590880	Thank you for the invitation, but I'm not sure if I can.
5590880	5591880	I'm running for president.
5591880	5594880	Right, no, it'll look like a payola?
5594880	5597880	That's, look, I don't care what it looks like,
5597880	5599880	because long as I'm always giving the money back,
5599880	5600880	I'm never really having much.
5600880	5601880	Nice.
5601880	5602880	Yeah, you know, I'm supposed to say,
5602880	5603880	I don't know when this contract kicks in.
5603880	5606880	Well, I signed it, but I don't know if it's like, so, yeah.
5606880	5610880	But, okay, watch HarmonQuest on see so.
5610880	5612880	You see it, so.
5612880	5613880	You like it.
5613880	5614880	You like it.
5614880	5616880	Coming soon.
5616880	5617880	It's going to be like a.
5617880	5619880	Like in the spring, maybe, or?
5619880	5620880	Probably coming in the spring.
5620880	5624880	Everything else does.
5624880	5625880	Don't clap for that.
5625880	5626880	Thirty.
5626880	5627880	Twenty nine.
5627880	5628880	Twenty eight.
5628880	5629880	Twenty seven.
5629880	5631880	Twenty six.
5631880	5632880	Twenty five.
5632880	5633880	Twenty four.
5633880	5634880	Twenty three.
5634880	5635880	Twenty two.
5635880	5636880	Twenty one.
5636880	5637880	Twenty three.
5637880	5640880	I should have started at ten.
5640880	5641880	Eighteen.
5641880	5642880	Seventeen.
5642880	5643880	Sixteen.
5643880	5644880	Fifteen.
5644880	5645880	Fourteen.
5645880	5646880	Thirteen.
5646880	5647880	Twelve.
5647880	5648880	Eleven.
5648880	5649880	Ten.
5649880	5650880	Nine.
5650880	5651880	Eight.
5651880	5652880	Seven.
5652880	5653880	Six.
5653880	5654880	Five.
5654880	5655880	Four.
5655880	5656880	Three.
5656880	5657880	Two.
5657880	5658880	One.
5658880	5659880	Zero.
5659880	5660880	Not going to walk.
5660880	5661880	Not going to pull.
5661880	5662880	Yeah.
5662880	5663880	The square rule is negative four.
5663880	5664880	That's good.
5664880	5665880	That's good.
5665880	5666880	Out of all the jokes, we should never call back.
5666880	5667880	Like.
5667880	5668880	That was a.
5668880	5670880	The thirty second countdown to no pay off.
5670880	5671880	The.
5671880	5672880	The.
5672880	5673880	The.
5673880	5674880	The.
5674880	5675880	The.
5675880	5676880	The.
5676880	5677880	The.
5677880	5682920	At the Wikipedia entry for the podcast of uh recurring bits.
5682920	5684920	And it's like all the shows, like, why is that recurring?
5684920	5687960	And then one of them is the thirty second stare.
5687960	5689840	Oh yeah.
5689840	5691880	That show needed that.
5691880	5694880	By the way, did you start your old Wikipedia page?
5694880	5695880	Did ya?
5695880	5696880	I don't know.
5696880	5697880	I don't know either.
5697880	5698880	Oh wait, wait.
5698880	5699880	You mean as a, do you mean as a human being?
5699880	5700880	Like a.
5700880	5701880	So yeah the just thoughts are old page.
5701880	5702880	Like a Dan Harmon Wikipedia page?
5702880	5703880	Yeah.
5703880	5704880	No, but I did.
5704880	5706880	There was one that had like a little bit and wait.
5706880	5707880	This is way back in the day.
5707880	5709880	Like I did add to it.
5709880	5712880	I did like put like, well also he kind of, you know, did this and that.
5712880	5714880	Well look, because they got things wrong.
5714880	5715880	You gotta go where do you go now?
5715880	5716880	Well they leave stuff out.
5716880	5717880	I don't know how new I am.
5717880	5718880	I thought you were born in Vermont.
5718880	5719880	I bought a book on your dumb ass.
5719880	5723880	But that was like in the early days of Wikipedia and I hadn't done that much.
5723880	5727880	And it was like, I learned my lesson hard because I didn't even know.
5727880	5729880	It was like, oh anyone can do this?
5729880	5731880	He's also brazenly witty.
5731880	5735880	And like, and then they like, I found, you know, I found others like this
5735880	5739880	tribunal of people that goes like, there's like, I found the thing where they're
5739880	5741880	just like, I think he wrote this.
5741880	5743880	Oh, I don't think I don't care who wrote it.
5743880	5744880	He doesn't.
5744880	5748880	He seems to be someone who mostly knows noteworthy people more than is
5748880	5749880	noteworthy.
5749880	5751880	I concur with Zach's on.
5751880	5756880	This man should be sent to the Phantom Zone.
5756880	5757880	I you're not wrong.
5757880	5760880	I think Jimmy Wales has too much power and authority.
5760880	5767880	And I promise to break up Wikipedia and run it like a public utility.
5767880	5768880	Oh, I know.
5768880	5770880	Spencer, are you ready to go?
5770880	5771880	Yeah.
5771880	5772880	Yeah.
5772880	5774880	I mean, you're going to be a criminal for six minutes, but go ahead.
5774880	5775880	Yeah.
5775880	5776880	They're not going to.
5776880	5777880	They're not going to.
5777880	5779880	We're not going to play over the, over the end.
5779880	5781880	There's all kinds of shit we can say in court.
5781880	5782880	The shit hits the fan.
5782880	5783880	What is this?
5783880	5784880	The patent troll thing?
5784880	5785880	What are they?
5785880	5787880	See, you start playing with corporations.
5787880	5788880	This is what happens.
5788880	5789880	I know.
5789880	5790880	But no, we're fine.
5790880	5791880	We're fine.
5791880	5792880	I'm good.
5792880	5793880	I'm clean.
5793880	5794880	I just met.
5794880	5797880	I don't get briefcase anything besides ice cream from Ben and Jerry's.
5797880	5798880	You get it.
5798880	5800880	I pay for it.
5800880	5804880	Should we drag our feet a little more then?
5804880	5809880	No, no, but I do say I'm not, I don't want to say I, I, but I am like so, I, so
5809880	5813880	amused by the idea of like a court case where we end up in court and there's
5813880	5818880	like our attorney like has to prove to the jury that it was like, well, but how many
5818880	5821880	minutes during a game are you actually playing?
5821880	5825880	And they have to, and it's like, oh my God, this is the scopes monkey trial of role
5825880	5826880	playing games.
5826880	5829880	It's like, like America is like tuning in and going, yeah, wait a minute.
5829880	5832880	Like these guys suck.
5832880	5836880	So now by law, we're only allowed 10 minutes of Shadowrun during the show.
5836880	5837880	I mean, we never play that much anyway.
5837880	5838880	It's not, it's not.
5838880	5839880	We just stop playing Shadowrun.
5839880	5842880	Well, if I shouldn't be here, the last thing I need is some dark for Hillary to
5842880	5843880	think up.
5843880	5846880	She's looking for something and I'm squeaky clean.
5846880	5849880	If this is going to wreck it up, get out of here.
5849880	5850880	It's not by law.
5850880	5853880	It's by contract, contractual agreement with our collaborators.
5853880	5854880	Oh fuck it.
5854880	5858880	But is it actually because it just you earlier said you were joking.
5858880	5859880	What are you joking about?
5859880	5860880	What?
5860880	5861880	About the contract to obligations.
5861880	5866880	Wait, when you guys talk at the same time, I hear to pop up.
5866880	5867880	What?
5867880	5868880	I mean, you're just joking, right?
5868880	5871880	No, it's not contractual obligations.
5871880	5874880	There is a, there is a, there is an agreement in the contract that we're not going to do
5874880	5877880	the basically the headline of it is that we're not going to do shit on the podcast.
5877880	5882880	That's going to like compete with what we're trying to get people to tune into for
5882880	5887880	Harmon question, which you and I know you're having, you're having your first reaction
5887880	5890880	to what will be a lifetime of fucking ridiculous contracts.
5890880	5894880	Well, I mean, no, I'll just these are, these are almost the good guys.
5894880	5897880	So they're, they're, they're just, they just want us.
5897880	5899880	They just want everybody to see the show and be happy.
5899880	5902880	Is there any way you could claim force majeure?
5902880	5903880	Yeah.
5903880	5908880	You were almost forced to by an act of God or some sort of non gender deity.
5908880	5911880	Spencer, can you give Bernie Sanders a spell called force majeure?
5911880	5913880	Can he cast force majeure on this?
5913880	5914880	I think yeah.
5914880	5915880	Yeah.
5915880	5916880	Force majeure.
5916880	5922880	You had to, you had to play the game with the shadow of the thing and there was no way
5922880	5926880	because it was just, there was, we were just, oops, these landed at our laps.
5926880	5927880	We had to play.
5928880	5931880	I think I said something that, and then I said that and I was joking.
5931880	5935880	The things that is not a joke is that what I, when it was in the 11th hour, I was like,
5935880	5943880	okay, 10 minutes, uh, not D and D meaning not like what you're not the milieu of.
5943880	5948880	So we couldn't play, for instance, Stratego for 20 minutes either.
5948880	5949880	I would love to do that.
5951880	5953880	Move the nine forward hits a nine.
5953880	5954880	They're both gone.
5954880	5956880	Move the nine forward hits a seven.
5956880	5957880	Oops.
5957880	5958880	Just the nine is forward.
5959880	5965880	Uh, we could, we could play Stratego because there's muskets in it, right?
5965880	5966880	Yep.
5966880	5970880	There's one spy and there's a Marshall and a general and they all have the same feather
5970880	5972880	hats that kind of look like my hair.
5972880	5976880	The most important thing is that it's, it's during our services rendered for the show
5976880	5977880	that we're doing.
5977880	5980880	It's the during the time that we wouldn't want to do anything that would, you know,
5980880	5983880	and, and, and also we've never played more than three minutes of shower.
5983880	5986880	I mean, yeah, but we've never had our hands tied.
5986880	5987880	I know.
5987880	5988880	I know.
5988880	5989880	I know.
5989880	5990880	It's weird.
5990880	5991880	It's weird to feel that on your wrists and I did.
5991880	5992880	Yeah.
5992880	5993880	Believe me.
5993880	5994880	I know.
5994880	5995880	You know what?
5995880	5996880	I used to think like this that I found socialism.
5996880	5997880	Fuck the core.
5997880	5998880	Fuck the corporation.
5998880	5999880	What's the worst they could do?
5999880	6001880	I think this could be a good thing.
6001880	6005880	Take, you know, just lean back, take a nice pill or something.
6005880	6010880	I say we, I say we test the waters and play 11 minutes just to see what I think it could
6010880	6011880	be.
6011880	6013880	You're going to now fucking taste that 10 minutes.
6013880	6015880	Like, like all 50 shades of gray.
6015880	6018880	Well, I think that argument could have been made for all the other times.
6018880	6020880	We've tasted 10 minutes of shadow run.
6020880	6024880	No, you're talking from a logical place and I'm talking from a sexy place.
6024880	6025880	That's all.
6025880	6029880	Like all of that energy that you're spending logically analyzing the idea of a contract
6029880	6033880	forbidding you from doing what you want is actually a form of you expressing.
6033880	6034880	Yeah.
6034880	6036880	I want to play shadow run.
6036880	6038880	And if you, if we had that for 10 minutes,
6038880	6042880	Oh, I mean, I have that every episode.
6042880	6043880	You have that.
6043880	6044880	Yeah.
6044880	6045880	Now we have that.
6045880	6047880	Do you watch me, baby?
6047880	6048880	Okay.
6048880	6049880	949.
6049880	6050880	I say we're going to start.
6050880	6055880	Is there a compelling reason that the United States set of the sitting currently serving
6055880	6057880	should be involved in these deliberations?
6057880	6061880	I say we use what we're about to do right now as a plug for our CISO thing.
6061880	6064880	This is like, if you, if you like what we're doing here, you're going to see an awesome
6064880	6066880	better version animated on CISO.
6066880	6072880	This is, this is the bullshit like fuck around time, as opposed to the high quality, high
6072880	6074880	budget thing that we're doing for CISO.
6074880	6075880	Like I said, force majeure.
6075880	6077880	I don't think, I don't think anyone disagrees with that.
6077880	6083880	You guys know that when you, when contracts go back and forth, it's literally two people,
6083880	6090880	one from each side who have absolutely no familiarity with anything that any of us do.
6090880	6095880	Speaking of no familiarity with anything, let's play Shadow Run Poorly.
6101880	6102880	All right.
6102880	6105880	Again by Jason Clymer.
6105880	6107880	Last town on Harmon Run.
6107880	6113880	The gang taking an unusual heist of antique MP3s decided that the easiest way to open
6113880	6118880	a musical lock was to visit a conservatory run by creepy children.
6118880	6120880	Achieving perfect pitch.
6120880	6125880	The gang did a lot of back and forthing due to Nightblade's alcoholism and Eve's rampant
6125880	6127880	banana na na na na na na.
6127880	6133880	And then arrived at a public storage facility, which had a deviant receptionist.
6133880	6138880	Despite Mercy's distraction, Eve was caught crawling under the counter, so the crew killed
6138880	6140880	the curious Cretan.
6140880	6145880	Hordegard and Dr. Friend fought about the morality while the Norwegian dwarf tried to
6145880	6148880	ascertain the locations of the sought songs.
6148880	6152880	As an afterthought, they remembered Hakai, who probably could have bypassed both the
6152880	6154880	musicians and the murder.
6154880	6157880	Will the gang successfully pull off a clean Shadow Run?
6157880	6162880	Is there no limit to the number of Merka murders Hakai can cover up?
6162880	6167880	What kind of post-apocalyptic music academy doesn't charge tuition?
6167880	6172880	Find out on this week's Harmon Run Shadow Town Time Town Time.
6172880	6173880	Thank you.
6175880	6183880	Just an answer to that person's question, there is a limit on the number of murders
6183880	6184880	I can cover up.
6184880	6189880	It has to be within 10 minutes and can't be done by a sword or spell.
6189880	6190880	You're not Hakai.
6190880	6194880	All right, Hakai, do you have me on your car right now?
6194880	6195880	Yeah.
6195880	6196880	Sure.
6196880	6197880	Can you find out?
6197880	6201880	I mean, we might have broken more eggs than we needed to make this omelet.
6201880	6204880	Can you find out where the MP3 storage unit is?
6204880	6206880	No, no, I cannot.
6206880	6208880	There's no records of that sort of thing.
6208880	6213880	People just kind of walk in, store their things and leave without any documents or anything.
6213880	6216880	They don't store it at the front desk here?
6216880	6219880	That guy wouldn't know what's being stored where?
6219880	6224880	No, that would be a huge breach of privacy, which is the whole point of these locations.
6224880	6225880	Right.
6225880	6228880	How many storage units are there in this facility?
6228880	6229880	Oh, man.
6229880	6231880	Let me look this up.
6231880	6233880	250.
6233880	6240880	Does that mean that it's designated a very important infrastructural area according
6240880	6242880	to federal guidelines?
6242880	6246880	Yeah, yeah, in accordance with the federal guidelines.
6246880	6253880	Hakai, it's Jim Nightblade talking without the usual Bruce Willis patois.
6253880	6257880	Hey, Jim.
6257880	6262880	The people that use this service, they also sometimes use it electronically, right?
6262880	6266880	They're storing things physically, but they're also logging in, logging out maybe
6266880	6268880	sometimes.
6268880	6276880	Does this company have, like Caldwell Banker does, just a fucking website where you have
6276880	6277880	an account?
6277880	6278880	No, no.
6278880	6283880	I mean, they have accounts with people who are giving them money, but that's really
6283880	6285880	all they have in terms of records.
6285880	6291880	Are they independently audited by an outside agency besides their old internal, okay,
6291880	6292880	that's nonsense, 27.
6292880	6293880	No, wait.
6293880	6294880	Hakai, you're answering my question.
6294880	6296380	They have accounts of people that are giving them money.
6296380	6299880	I'm not asking if they have lists of the contents of the storage units.
6299880	6300880	Well, there you go.
6300880	6301880	Yep.
6301880	6302880	So they have an accounting system.
6302880	6308880	They have a database full of people's names that give them money in exchange for their
6308880	6309880	services.
6309880	6310880	Yeah, yeah.
6310880	6311880	Okay.
6311880	6312880	So maybe there's somebody to go with there, right?
6312880	6313880	Am I right?
6313880	6314880	I'm just an assassin.
6314880	6316880	You guys figure it out.
6317880	6322880	I mean, is there a way to use that musical technology we have to maybe walk by all the
6322880	6326880	things and sing to the MP3 locks or something like that, or is that crazy?
6326880	6329880	You're the worst shadow runner I've ever heard.
6329880	6331880	I don't know.
6331880	6333880	I'm just spitballing here.
6333880	6334880	All right.
6334880	6335880	Well, I guess that's what I'm doing.
6335880	6338880	Can I actually project from room to room and kind of tell?
6338880	6342880	Would I be able to see if I could actually project through the rooms?
6342880	6345880	Would I know if I saw them?
6345880	6351880	When you're in astral form, you wouldn't really be able to tell just physical, non-living
6351880	6352880	objects.
6352880	6355880	They just all kind of look like gray blobs and shadows.
6355880	6362880	Can I suggest Professor Plub in the conservatory with the lob clock?
6362880	6363880	Senator, no.
6363880	6364880	I'm lost.
6364880	6365880	I'm lost.
6365880	6367880	What's your character, Senator?
6367880	6369880	What's my character's shadow run?
6369880	6370880	No, no, no.
6370880	6372880	That's just the first word you saw when you...
6372880	6373880	Okay.
6373880	6374880	Number nine.
6374880	6375880	He moves forward.
6375880	6376880	He hits an eight.
6376880	6377880	I think he's Hordegard.
6377880	6378880	All right.
6378880	6381880	Oh, Senator, you actually are like a character that has the power to...
6381880	6387880	I mean, does Hordegard have any powers that could facilitate us here?
6387880	6390880	I guess along the lines of astral projection, he's always doing random shit.
6390880	6391880	Yeah.
6391880	6392880	Gives him omniscience.
6392880	6396880	Does he have the power to rally a popular mass movement of people?
6396880	6397880	He does it.
6397880	6401880	He could break down the power structures that have been rolling up until now.
6401880	6402880	Yeah.
6402880	6403880	Definitely has that power.
6403880	6404880	There you go.
6404880	6405880	Good.
6405880	6406880	That sounds right.
6406880	6407880	Okay.
6407880	6408880	So...
6408880	6409880	What I would...
6409880	6410880	Go to jail.
6410880	6411880	Go directly to jail.
6411880	6418600	What I would be looking at if I were a cop, and I used to be backstory, is I would be looking
6418600	6419600	at a timeline.
6419600	6422880	I would be looking at whatever you do know, and then like...
6422880	6425880	Oh, he's back in character now.
6425880	6428640	It's going to be good now.
6428640	6433840	Are we able to pinpoint a time when somebody would have been storing a bunch of MP3s, as
6433840	6434840	opposed to when...
6434840	6440720	You know, can we isolate like a forensically identifiable activity that would be able to
6440720	6442120	be seen on the computer?
6442120	6447200	Like, oh, I started my account, and then I dumped a bunch of shit in the storage unit,
6447200	6448200	and then I...
6448200	6449200	It's like...
6449200	6451640	Whose account hasn't been active since Genesis?
6451640	6455920	You mean like if they wanted an illustration or a computer screen?
6455920	6459640	The graphic data format.
6459640	6460640	I was just...
6460640	6461640	I'm thinking...
6461640	6462640	Excel, maybe?
6462640	6463640	An animation in Excel?
6463640	6466400	I have a lower IQ than...
6466400	6468280	Usually when I was a cop, we would just like...
6468280	6470480	We would go like, okay, there's a dead person.
6470480	6471720	When did they die?
6471720	6475960	And then there were certain people who, because they were at work when that person died, they
6475960	6476960	didn't do it.
6476960	6481680	And then other people, like, they wouldn't say where they were, so they might have done
6481680	6482680	it.
6482680	6487600	They would just put the black guy in jail.
6487600	6496880	I believe that you should have the answer for that, and we're body cameras, but yes.
6496880	6499160	Was there a question there?
6499160	6504160	That was a textbook filibuster.
6504160	6507640	It wasn't for you, it was for my fellow Shadowrunners, I was going like, I don't know, is there a
6507640	6509400	way we can figure out, can we use the...
6509400	6510560	Oh yeah, we were thinking it out.
6511080	6514720	Because that guy has access to whatever the fucking, like, their accounting system, say,
6514720	6518440	can you turn that into, like, actually deducing any... eliminating anything.
6518440	6519440	Okay, remember in...
6519440	6521600	Okay, this is Dan Harmon talking.
6521600	6526480	Remember in the Fugitive movie with Harrison Ford, how he took just the fact that a one-armed
6526480	6531640	guy killed his wife in a hospital's database, and he was like, he narrowed it down to, like,
6531640	6535040	prosthesis, and so there was shit he knew and shit he didn't know, and then he figured
6535040	6536040	shit out.
6536040	6539280	I'm too stupid to do that stuff, but I know how he did it.
6539280	6541520	He knew stuff, and then he used it to know more stuff.
6541520	6545640	Could you handle the part where he shaves in the sink and then goes off running?
6545640	6549000	He ate some oranges and he made some IDs.
6549000	6553720	Could you do the part where you're up in the sewer thing and he go, how are you doing?
6553720	6555440	And he says, I don't care.
6555440	6559240	I would reform the marshal service, by the way, so that if you did shout, I didn't do
6559240	6561760	it, they would have to go, all right, let's stop everything.
6561760	6566280	I think it's a good idea.
6566280	6571280	Especially if your options are one, jumping over Niagara Falls, or two, getting shot.
6571280	6573080	I don't think any more deaths than custody.
6573080	6577880	I feel like, at that point, you're supposed to just put your gun down and say, I care.
6577880	6578880	Right.
6578880	6584480	Or make sure that you're chasing people in smaller enclosures, like a water park or something,
6584480	6589360	so that if you don't go down, if you do choose to jump, it's just a little curlicue for about
6589360	6591480	400 feet, then you're done.
6592040	6594880	Then you're in a nice puddle of spit and kid piss.
6597880	6598880	All right.
6598880	6599880	Well, I give up.
6599880	6600880	I mean, Eve, you're-
6600880	6601880	That was easy.
6601880	6605080	That was, you gave up faster than Rick Perry.
6607280	6608280	Thank you.
6608280	6609280	Zing.
6610680	6612280	You're like the face lady.
6612280	6616800	Like, you're the one who gets us the jobs and cons us into buildings and Hordegard,
6616800	6619880	you're being played by a character.
6620880	6621880	Pat, you're-
6621880	6622880	I'm just a doctor.
6622880	6623880	You're a doctor.
6623880	6627880	I mean, when I'm the brains of the operation, we're fucked.
6627880	6630880	I'm Dan Harmon's impression of Bruce Willis.
6630880	6633880	Spencer, who was the guy at Hank's Last Stand?
6633880	6634880	Was it Hank?
6634880	6635880	Yep.
6635880	6636880	Who wanted the MP3s?
6636880	6640280	Would he know when that stuff was taken and put in that storage?
6640280	6642880	Would he know the date that maybe that was put in the storage?
6642880	6645880	Nah, he's just heard stories about this vault.
6645880	6646880	It's a vault.
6646880	6648880	I mean, it's a storage vault.
6648880	6653880	Could I cast some sort of, like, small animal or cricket to go inside
6653880	6656880	that can run from room to room and be able to suss out which room had it or anything?
6656880	6657880	You got one.
6657880	6658880	You got a couple here.
6659880	6660880	Well, that's a coincidence.
6660880	6661880	It's cricket season.
6661880	6662880	This is a great podcast.
6662880	6664880	By the way, yep.
6665880	6668880	You know, scientifically, crickets really like showbiz.
6668880	6671880	Some of our best shows happen during cricket mating season.
6671880	6672880	You can look it up.
6675880	6677880	Yeah, that's something you could attempt.
6677880	6682880	Okay, I summon magic musical search crickets.
6682880	6685880	And the cricket's going to go from room to room at light speed,
6685880	6687880	or very fast, at cricket speed.
6687880	6691880	And go from room to room and find out...
6694880	6695880	Exactly.
6695880	6697880	That's based on the deaf pugs from, you know, Tron.
6697880	6698880	Okay.
6700880	6702880	Magical music cricket.
6702880	6703880	Go search.
6704880	6709880	The exertion of your magical music cricket makes you take three drain damages.
6709880	6715880	It conjures itself into existence and starts scurrying in and out of reality.
6715880	6717880	Guys, all we have to do now is wait.
6717880	6719880	My cricket will take care of everything.
6722880	6727880	So, just to clarify, I'm still ahead in Iowa and New Hampshire,
6727880	6729880	and about to pull even in South Carolina.
6729880	6730880	Is that right?
6730880	6731880	Yeah.
6731880	6732880	Okay, good.
6733880	6735880	While we're waiting for the cricket's report,
6735880	6739880	even though I have the IQ of Sam Malone from Cheers,
6739880	6745880	I go over to the console, whoever the guy that worked there worked,
6745880	6748880	and I just start hitting buttons,
6748880	6752880	like nothing that looks like a red button that says police above it,
6752880	6755880	but just buttons like W.
6757880	6759880	Or like enter or function.
6760880	6761880	You do that.
6763880	6766880	Those aren't commands, so it's not.
6766880	6767880	Okay, you know what?
6767880	6773880	Then I come in to help him, and I bring out my nice old typewriter,
6773880	6776880	and I roll a piece of paper in,
6776880	6779880	and then I just make sure with a little test, like test, test, test, test, test,
6779880	6780880	what to throw,
6780880	6785880	and then I start typing a small short message that says,
6785880	6790880	hey, let them open up the door all the way off,
6790880	6792880	let them create another universe or whatever.
6794880	6797880	Yes, good, socialism.
6799880	6800880	You do that.
6802880	6804880	You don't have any ideas, do you, Eve Libertine?
6804880	6807880	I mean, you're not suffering in silence, right?
6807880	6808880	You're just kind of like...
6808880	6809880	I'm kind of suffering in silence.
6809880	6810880	Oh, you are?
6810880	6812880	Well, this is a good time to...
6812880	6815880	No wrong answers has never been more accurate.
6817880	6819880	What's on your mind?
6819880	6821880	I'm not really sure.
6821880	6823880	Oh, so you're just suffering.
6823880	6824880	I'm kind of lost.
6824880	6825880	She's silent and suffering.
6825880	6826880	I'm silent and suffering.
6826880	6834880	Like millions of Americans who are also silent and suffering in this audience and beyond.
6837880	6842880	I just meant you're not like being polite by not...
6842880	6845880	You don't know how to search a storage unit.
6845880	6848880	Right, I'm just not sure what I'm supposed to be doing.
6848880	6851880	Right now, I'm kind of just standing here looking pretty.
6851880	6852880	That's what I'm doing right now.
6852880	6854880	Oh, don't.
6854880	6855880	I mean, come on.
6855880	6856880	It's okay.
6856880	6857880	Objectify your gender.
6857880	6858880	Yeah, I mean, well...
6858880	6859880	This is true.
6859880	6861880	Part of our job is to objectify our gender.
6861880	6862880	That's how we get a lot of our jobs.
6862880	6867880	Pat, over there, you want me to maybe make some small talk with you?
6867880	6868880	A back rub?
6868880	6869880	A back rub?
6869880	6870880	Sure, go ahead.
6870880	6872880	Just because that's your job, I mean.
6872880	6874880	All right, I'm just trying to do my job.
6874880	6875880	That feels good.
6875880	6876880	You know what you're doing.
6876880	6881880	I mean, I think in a post-feminist world, it's one of the options that an activated woman has.
6881880	6885880	I think I should be able to stand here and look pretty and do my job at the same time.
6885880	6890880	I sent my cricket back to see if my cricket has found any information.
6890880	6895880	It says, oh, man, I found so many peanuts.
6897880	6900880	I asked you to look for MP3s, not peanuts.
6900880	6901880	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6901880	6902880	There's a plosive peanut there.
6902880	6904880	You can understand the confusion.
6905880	6908880	No, I found some MP3s.
6908880	6909880	I didn't find a lot.
6909880	6913880	I just found Frankie Frank's Greatest Hits.
6913880	6915880	You found Frankie Frank's Greatest Hits?
6915880	6916880	Yeah, that's it, though.
6916880	6922880	I go on the comm and find our Johnson, our Hank, back at Hank last stand and say, Hank, you got me on your comm?
6922880	6923880	Yeah.
6923880	6926880	Do you like Frankie Frank's Greatest Hits?
6926880	6928880	No, that's New Age garbage man.
6928880	6931880	Okay, we'll call you back in a bit.
6931880	6934880	I mean, I don't want to be always this guy, but maybe it's a dumb mission.
6934880	6942880	Maybe it's maybe it was maybe we got made up during a drunken blackout when we had like a lot of overseas missions.
6942880	6944880	I think that it's not wrong.
6944880	6948880	Maybe to pull back and concentrate on a whole country.
6948880	6951880	Don't blame the mission or not.
6951880	6952880	Right.
6952880	6959880	But I mean, I'm not blaming the mission saying like, well, we're clearly incapable of accomplishing the issue.
6959880	6962880	Don't think that the people put their mind to is impossible.
6962880	6966880	Even in a envelope that's inscrutable.
6966880	6967880	How many?
6967880	6974880	I know that there's a way of knowing with Hakai's information, how many storage units?
6974880	6975880	250.
6975880	6976880	250.
6976880	6977880	250.
6977880	6978880	All right.
6978880	6984880	So a cricket crawls a maximum of three feet per minute.
6984880	6986880	I don't think that's an option.
6986880	6989880	Everyone's response to that was amazing.
6989880	6992880	That's the most controversial thing I've ever said.
6992880	6993880	It really is.
6993880	6995880	I think three feet a minute.
6995880	6996880	I think a cricket crawls.
6996880	6997880	It's more of snail speed.
6997880	6998880	Yeah, it's not fast.
6998880	6999880	Okay.
6999880	7000880	I have the data.
7000880	7001880	I've looked.
7001880	7002880	Spencer, how many rooms?
7002880	7006880	For Brandeis University and crickets are able to go about 15 meters.
7006880	7009880	Spencer, how many rooms has the cricket been through?
7009880	7011880	What percentage of those 250 has he gone through?
7011880	7015880	You don't know.
7015880	7016880	I mean, it's a cricket.
7016880	7017880	You sent him out.
7017880	7018880	You brought him back.
7018880	7019880	He said he found...
7019880	7023880	At the risk of draining myself more, can I summon three more crickets to triple the
7023880	7024880	speed on this?
7024880	7025880	You know it'd be great.
7025880	7026880	What?
7026880	7027880	How much does 250 cost?
7027880	7030960	Send one cricket into fucking every single room.
7030960	7032480	That would probably drain me to death.
7032480	7033480	Yeah, probably.
7033480	7036720	I took three or four drain on one cricket.
7036720	7037720	Can you...
7037720	7038720	I've only got like 12 drain or something like that.
7038720	7039880	Are we going to get sued?
7039880	7040880	What?
7040880	7041880	No.
7041880	7042880	No, we haven't played shit.
7042880	7045400	We haven't even done anything.
7046400	7052400	I walk up to one of the storage lockers and I take my gun and I shoot at the...
7052400	7053400	The lock?
7053400	7054400	The lock.
7054400	7055400	Yes, thank you.
7055400	7056400	That's the word I was looking for.
7056400	7063400	You shoot the lock off the storage container and the roller door rolls up.
7063400	7066400	We've got 249 more.
7066400	7070400	Look around and see if you see any MP3s in there.
7070400	7071400	I look around.
7071400	7075400	You see stacks upon stacks of an orandac chairs.
7077400	7080400	We'll come back to these later.
7083400	7088400	Let's thank Pat and Hannah, our newly engaged, newly afiansts,
7088400	7091400	Disney-loving New Hampshireites.
7091400	7093400	Thank you, Senator.
7093400	7097400	Please have a huge round of applause for Senator Bernie Sanders.
7097400	7098400	Feel the burn!
7098400	7101400	As played by James Adomian, everybody.
7101400	7104400	The wonderful, fantastic James Adomian.
7104400	7106400	Spencer Crittenden.
7108400	7112400	I'm Jeff Davis, your mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.
7115400	7116400	We are the best.
7116400	7118400	Justin in the booth.
7118400	7121400	Justin producing all Feral audio podcasts,
7121400	7124400	bringing them to you with his weird pirate shirts
7125400	7130400	and jaw grinding emotional things.
7130400	7133400	And also Chris Borath, Kevin Days, Sarah Hill, Zach McKeever.
7133400	7135400	All the people out here with nerd mouth, thank you so much.
7135400	7137400	It's a tenuousness.
7137400	7139400	No, sorry, I was finishing this sentence.
7139400	7140400	I started 10 minutes ago.
7140400	7142400	All right, drive fast and take chances.
7142400	7143400	Thank you for coming, everybody.
7143400	7144400	Are we the best at Shadow Runner?
7144400	7145400	What?
7149400	7150400	Did you get any of that?
7151400	7153400	It's a good show.
7154400	7155400	Thank you.
