0	23360	Hello everybody, welcome to Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California.
23360	30360	Harman Town is now in session.
30360	41360	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
41360	44360	Thank you.
44360	48360	Welcome back from Comic Con, thank you for coming back so early.
48360	52360	How many of you guys went to Comic Con this weekend?
52360	55360	Not so many, okay, they're still out there.
55360	58360	It's a weird year, I was just talking to Kumail in the back room,
58360	65360	and it's the first year when they did the Montreal Comedy Festival at the same time as Comic Con,
65360	74360	which means that Montreal must have just been really jockey road comics, nothing else.
74360	77360	It must have been a pretty uptight environment, right?
77360	81360	That Montreal draws, oh, that either one of those draws from the other side of the country?
81360	87360	I'm saying that that Venn diagram's cleavage is prodigious.
87360	92360	I think, you know, comedy people and whatever, I don't know.
92360	96360	People go there to promote shit, new TV shows and stuff.
96360	99360	Whatever, it's not worth discussing.
99360	101360	Just for laughs though, isn't that kind of on the decline?
101360	104360	It seems like it's like lesser and lesser over here.
104360	108360	Uh-oh, you hear that Montreal?
108360	112360	Time for a new country to have a recession.
112360	115360	I don't know, I don't know. I've only been there once, I certainly enjoy it.
115360	118360	It just seems like you hear less and less about just for laughs or gipoli or whatever.
118360	122360	Well, you know, they try not to take it too seriously.
122360	127360	It's right in the name. They never asked for it to be a big deal.
127360	131360	I think the people that organize it take it very seriously.
131360	134360	Well, so you're saying they're lying when they say just for laughs?
134360	137360	I think there's a little bit of deception there.
137360	141360	You're right. I mean, yeah, Comic-Con's not really about comics.
141360	142360	I guess there's a lie in every name.
142360	147360	Snickers, what are you doing? You're eating it, not laughing at it.
147360	150360	It's not packed with peanuts. It doesn't satisfy.
150360	155360	GE doesn't bring anything to life. They make landmines.
155360	157360	And light bulbs.
157360	160360	Yeah, a couple light bulbs.
160360	165360	So anyways, looking at my Evernote thing, Bob,
165360	171360	I want to promote this feral audio thing that we're doing August 5th, 9 p.m. at Nerdmelt.
171360	174360	Here comes a bunch of facts. I'm not a great pitchman.
174360	178360	But it's hosted by me and Aaron. It's going to be here at Nerdmelt.
178360	185360	We're doing a live recording of a comedy album. I hope I don't need any material.
185360	189360	It's hosted by myself and my lovely betrothed Aaron McGathey.
189360	193360	There will be appearances by Duncan Trussell, Steve Agee, Brody Stevens,
193360	198360	tons of people who have been here in Harmon Town who also happen to be part of the feral audio network.
198360	202360	So come to that. That's August 5th.
202360	204360	August 5th. What day of the week is it, August 5th?
204360	205360	That's a Wednesday.
205360	207360	A Wednesday? Tuesday.
207360	208360	I just guessed.
208360	211360	No matter what, it's prime going out time.
211360	214360	Just get on your mink stole and pop on down here.
214360	217360	Wednesday or Tuesday, August 5th, 9 p.m.
217360	221360	Bring a glass of warm milk and the kids.
221360	224360	Dan, right now, I promise that you're going to prepare some great material for the people.
224360	227360	I'll probably do 10 minutes. I'm the dentist.
227360	229360	All right. Animal Corner.
229360	232360	Animal Corner!
237360	239360	Give a spiel for Animal Corner.
239360	240360	Welcome, man.
240360	242360	Animal Corner.
242360	249360	All the news that's fit to paw about our furry friends.
249360	252360	Here's the host of Animal Corner.
252360	255360	The Cats Meow.
255360	259360	Dan Furman.
261360	263360	All right.
263360	269360	No relation to Mark Furman, the racist detective.
269360	274360	Okay, we're distant cousins, but I am a fan of animals. I do not.
274360	278360	There should be a book series called Mark Furman, racist detective.
278360	280360	All right. Animal Corner.
280360	283360	So I talked last week about my dog.
283360	286360	My dog, we are in the age now of animals can watch TV with us.
286360	288360	Erin came home tonight.
288360	289360	She missed Harvey.
289360	291360	She was like, I'm going to watch TV with him.
291360	296360	She found a movie franchise with these little buddies.
296360	298360	You know about these guys?
298360	301360	They're little puppies that get into adventures.
301360	304360	The little buddies franchise.
304360	305360	They go to space.
305360	307360	Sometimes they're superheroes, something like that.
307360	308360	I get the name right.
308360	309360	All right.
309360	311360	I'm 50.
311360	314360	But fucking Harvey loves this shit.
314360	316360	But it's like, so this is getting weird.
316360	318360	Like, like this is programming for dogs.
318360	320360	Well, it would appear to be.
320360	324360	I mean, I think it also seems to be written by them.
324360	327360	But it's like the Harvey goes nuts.
327360	331360	Like the thing that drives him the most crazy is if you tape him on a phone,
331360	332360	put it, put it on the TV.
332360	335360	He goes crazy, but he also loves anything.
335360	341360	We put on an animated Garfield trailer, a Garfield movie.
341360	344360	And he was going nuts about the cats dancing around.
344360	345360	Really?
345360	346360	Yeah.
346360	347360	And he does it not for everything.
347360	349360	You put up, you know, footage of John Ritter.
349360	350360	He goes, OK.
350360	351360	Does he have food?
351360	352360	I don't care.
352360	354360	And then any animal comes on screen.
354360	355360	He goes crazy.
355360	358360	Which John Ritter footage did you put up?
358360	359360	Skin deep.
359360	360360	Skin deep.
360360	361360	The condom fight.
361360	362360	He doesn't like it?
362360	363360	Condom lightsaber fight.
363360	364360	That's not dog programming.
364360	365360	No.
365360	366360	You would think they would.
366360	367360	Yeah, whatever.
367360	371360	But even the dogs can be dressed like superheroes or in space outfits.
371360	376360	There were dogs, puppies on the moon floating around in space outfits.
376360	377360	And Harvey was going crazy.
377360	379360	They got to the moon before Harman-town did.
379360	380360	Yeah.
380360	385360	I mean, it's more noteworthy.
385360	386360	It's just a movie, first of all.
386360	388360	They didn't actually get to the moon.
388360	393360	And also, it's just weird that the dog is looking at the narrative
393360	396360	and he recognizes that it's puppies in the space suits.
396360	397360	I barely can tell they're puppies.
397360	399360	How would you describe Harvey's reaction to these dogs?
399360	400360	He just barks.
400360	401360	He barks at them.
401360	403360	And then he tries to look around the other side of the wall
403360	406360	to see where this window is looking on these poor animals.
406360	407360	Yeah.
407360	409360	We can't figure out if he's enjoying it or if it's torture.
409360	412360	Like, his tail's wagging the whole time.
412360	413360	We'll just go with that.
413360	414360	But he barks.
414360	417360	And then sometimes he whines a little bit.
417360	419360	That's what makes him feel a little bad.
419360	421360	Sorry I'm burping.
422360	423360	All right.
423360	424360	That's half of Animal Corner.
424360	428360	As you know, Animal Corner is a multi-story segment.
428360	429360	Next item.
429360	431360	I'm sad that we're only halfway through it.
431360	433360	That means we only have half left.
433360	434360	Yeah.
434360	438360	Rogaine kills cats.
438360	439360	No.
439360	441360	The active ingredient, minoxidil.
441360	442360	I finally have a reason.
442360	444360	I can just go bald in peace.
444360	445360	Wait.
445360	446360	Have you been using Rogaine?
446360	447360	Well, I bought some.
447360	448360	I got some online.
448360	450360	And did you kill a cat?
450360	453360	No, but our friend Mike Chillian was at Comic Con.
453360	457360	And he told me through tears that he didn't know this.
457360	458360	And who would know this?
458360	460360	They don't put it on the box.
460360	464360	It's just a picture of a bald guy crying and then a picture.
464360	467360	The picture next to it isn't a dead cat.
467360	470360	It's a guy with hair giving a thumbs up.
470360	475360	They should put a cat in the background dying.
475360	477360	Did Mike Chillian kill a cat?
477360	478360	Yeah.
478360	479360	He did?
479360	480360	Did Mike Chillian kill a cat?
480360	481360	No, the cats don't.
481360	483360	It's not like milk.
483360	484360	It's so dangerous.
484360	485360	It entering to cats.
485360	486360	They can't metabolize.
486360	489360	A cat can be near your hair with Rogaine on it.
489360	491360	Yeah, they can lick it, inhale it.
491360	496360	Even if they smell it at all, it could have a huge toxic reaction to colorful.
496360	500360	Minoxidil is originally being researched as a hypertension treatment.
500360	503360	It's a blood pressure medication.
503360	507360	So babies can have a really bad reaction to it too.
507360	508360	So you have to be careful.
508360	510360	Who's sniffing your pillowcase?
510360	513360	Who's licking your hat insides?
513360	517360	Originally, it was researched as that.
517360	520360	Yeah, and then they found out it made hair grow sometimes.
520360	521360	That's terrible.
521360	524360	If you make something, we're going to release your tension.
524360	527360	Also, maybe hair will shoot out of your skin.
527360	529360	Also, a cat might explode.
529360	532360	Yeah, so that's it.
532360	535360	Now I can say, well, I tried to have hair.
535360	536360	You have hair?
536360	537360	I have plenty of hair.
537360	539360	I got hair for people to go around.
539360	541360	If anybody needs hair, come see me after the show.
541360	542360	Wait.
542360	546360	I'm surprised that you are a person that tried minoxidil.
546360	550360	You seem kind of like laissez faire when it comes to hair.
550360	552360	Yeah, I don't...
552360	554360	Laissez hair, they call it.
554360	555360	I don't believe...
555360	557360	My definition, and this is a little hard.
557360	564360	So Chris, to define this line, but my line is dishonesty.
565360	572360	Anyone that's listening who does anything that they keep a secret for your own personal group, whatever.
572360	573360	I'm not judging you.
573360	574360	That's not at all.
574360	580360	I'm saying my personal definition that would make me unhappy, the line that I could never cross,
580360	582360	is where I was keeping something a secret.
582360	588360	If I had something on my head, I was like, oh man, I can't even tell anybody anything.
588360	593360	That's where I can't go, but lots of people can and need to do that, and that's great for them.
594360	596360	So I thought, oh, Rogaine, I don't know.
596360	602360	It's been around for decades, and maybe it's just standard.
602360	605360	Because I'm a little thin on top, and I just thought maybe if it's preventative,
605360	607360	I'll put a little topical mousse on there.
607360	609360	It's like they give you a little can of mousse.
609360	611360	So I tried it a couple of times.
611360	617360	But the really cool thing about Rogaine is that it puts in your hand the power to be lazy.
617360	622360	That's the important thing, because I think the big issue with men losing their hair,
622360	627360	I think it's just like anything about getting older, slowly melting.
627360	629360	It's just about control.
629360	632360	It's just something that you didn't choose to happen on that schedule.
632360	635360	And it doesn't really matter when it happens or what's happening.
635360	639360	It just makes you feel powerless.
639360	644360	But if you can buy a product that's like, I choose to take control of this.
644360	646360	I don't even think it matters if it works.
646360	649360	Because for me, I bought it, and I used it like twice, and I stopped using it.
649360	651360	Thank God for my cap, it turns out.
651360	652360	Really?
652360	654360	Yeah, because look at me.
654360	656360	I don't fucking shower.
656360	660360	There's a million things I don't do to make myself look attractive.
660360	663360	I threw in the towel a long time ago.
663360	666360	And it's nice to have a towel to throw in, like a can of Rogaine.
666360	669360	Am I going to bother with this procedure?
669360	670360	No.
670360	672360	And then I'm like, yeah, I choose to be bald.
672360	673360	How many cats have died?
673360	675360	Is there proof?
675360	676360	Six.
676360	680360	I was just looking it up beforehand because I didn't want to be libelous or irresponsible
680360	684360	because as you know, Harmontown is the epicenter of journalistic integrity.
684360	687360	We have never said a single inaccurate thing.
687360	690360	Whether we're talking about the Muppets or Israel.
690360	695360	We always get everything right, and everyone's always very happy with our reporting.
695360	699360	By the way, which do you think is more controversial?
699360	700360	The Muppets are Israel.
700360	701360	Be real.
701360	703360	I would say the Muppets.
703360	708360	Yeah, I bet you'd get in faster hot water talking shit about the Muppets at a party
709360	712360	than being critical of Israeli foreign policy.
712360	718360	I bet you get a 50-50 chance, which is going to get you a social black eye first.
718360	720360	Just think about it.
720360	721360	Just get off my ass.
721360	723360	Some of those movies are shitty.
723360	725360	Just make nine more.
725360	727360	Let's make nine more Muppet movies.
727360	728360	I think we've almost got it.
728360	730360	But aren't they always kind of good?
730360	732360	I haven't seen one since Muppet's Take Manhattan.
732360	734360	Aren't they always kind of enjoyable?
734360	735360	I'm a little sick of it.
735360	736360	I'm a little sick of it.
737360	738360	No, Muppet Treasure Island's a goodie.
738360	739360	That's a fucking goodie.
739360	740360	It's Erin's favorite.
740360	743360	She's got a relationship with it, and I can't say anything bad about it.
743360	744360	She's not here tonight.
744360	747360	I'm just tired of the Muppets.
747360	750360	But if you're going to be the Muppets, at least do Robert Louis Stevenson.
750360	753360	Let's take a good property where the story is already intact.
753360	755360	I think that I would agree with Erin.
755360	758360	Erin would agree with you that, yes, that was their biggest success,
758360	760360	just taking existing stories.
760360	762360	I like the Muppets because they hired Charles Grodin a lot.
762360	765360	There was lots of Charles Grodin, and the crowd goes silent.
766360	769360	Charles Grodin, before the face work.
769360	771360	All right, so Rogan kills your cats, animals...
771360	774360	Are there cats that are verifiably killed because of Rogan?
774360	776360	Is this an actual news item?
776360	779360	I didn't do a ton of research, but I saw...
779360	781360	You're going just on Mike Chillian's murder of his own.
781360	784360	The Poison Control Center, I think it said somewhere,
784360	788360	had six cases of cats having terrible reactions to it,
788360	790360	but they can just sniff your hair.
790360	791360	Anyways, it's over.
791360	794360	So if I go bald, it's for humanitarian reasons.
796360	797360	Is that the end of Animal Corner?
797360	799360	That's the end of Animal Corner!
806360	809360	I yelled at Channing Tatum through a closing elevator at Comic-Con.
813360	816360	This is a stolen bit that I got from one of the New York Comedy Sports guys.
816360	820360	The loading dock elevator door was closing backstage at Comic-Con.
820360	822360	That's where you're going to see the famous people,
822360	824360	because everyone's back there.
824360	828360	That's the tunnel that connects all of the panels.
828360	829360	So you're just...
829360	833360	Joss Whedon's getting flushed down the same toilet as Stan Lee
833360	837360	and Black Widow and whoever's doing anything.
837360	839360	So you see him...
839360	841360	I was dressed as a bird the whole time.
841360	845360	And then I saw Channing Tatum in a loading dock elevator
845360	847360	and the doors started to close.
847360	850360	And just as they almost finished closing,
850360	855360	I did a little elevator bit I learned from our friends in New York Comedy Sports.
855360	857360	I ran towards the door, panicked, and said,
857360	859360	SOIL IT, GREATEST PEOPLE!
860360	862360	Just anything, really.
862360	864360	You know, the elevator door is closing.
864360	870360	Like, what would make you worry if you just had heard it?
870360	873360	You're assuming Channing Tatum knows that film?
873360	874360	I'm sure he's...
874360	875360	Is that a safe assumption?
875360	876360	Do we know Channing Tatum is...
876360	878360	That's not why I did it.
879360	881360	I did it so I could tell these people.
881360	885360	I bet Channing Tatum's laughing his film-loving ass off right now.
885360	887360	Did you get a reaction?
887360	891360	No, you eschew the reaction.
891360	894360	There's no final moment when he's going up and he looks down and he goes,
894360	896360	Oh my God, I'll never see you again.
896360	898360	It's a blind joke.
898360	901360	Not a blind joke for blind fans.
901360	903360	It's a blindly offered joke.
903360	904360	Do you have a blind joke?
904360	906360	Like, for actual blind people?
906360	912360	A blind, this blind guy, just walks into a wall
912360	921360	and the bartender says, Hey, look out.
921360	923360	Sorry, blind people.
923360	928360	Sorry I called you blind people and not Jeffrey,
928360	930360	Suzanne.
930360	934360	You're human beings without sight.
934360	936360	You don't need to be dehumanized like that.
936360	938360	You're not blind people.
938360	939360	It's weird.
939360	944360	If you weren't blind, you wouldn't mind being called a blind person, would you?
944360	947360	Well, I'm really strong of character.
947360	951360	I'm not one of these weak blind people.
951360	953360	You know, they say when you lose one of your senses,
953360	955360	you become weaker of character.
955360	957360	I don't know if you've heard that.
957360	960360	He's talking to you, Jeffrey and Suzanne.
960360	962360	You weak blind people.
963360	966360	Your other senses gain strength, but your character in general weakens.
966360	969360	You become a worse person.
969360	972360	Would you rather be deaf or blind, if you had to pick?
972360	978360	I think I would rather be blind.
978360	981360	Really? You'd rather lose sight than hearing?
981360	985360	Yeah, and I know humans are 90% visual kind of creatures,
985360	988360	you know, we're these primates that need to see the function,
988360	992360	but we, psychologically, we really need to be connected to each other.
992360	997360	You know, deaf communities, they're very,
997360	1000360	it's much more, like, passionate,
1000360	1003360	because they're, like, being deaf is, like,
1003360	1010360	a really divisive experience.
1010360	1015360	It puts a bigger wall between you and the person next to you than being blind.
1015360	1017360	That's, you know, you have this impairment,
1017360	1019360	and you can handle it however you want to,
1019360	1022360	but you can still hear and talk to the people around you.
1022360	1025360	That's deafness, especially before the Internet,
1025360	1027360	was, like, a really, really, like, really just isolates you.
1027360	1029360	Human beings can't be isolated.
1029360	1031360	It makes them feel terrible.
1031360	1035360	Anyway, so I assume I wouldn't be able to suffer that very well.
1035360	1036360	I need to be able to talk to people.
1036360	1038360	I could do this job blind.
1038360	1040360	I'm not saying, if you're listening, God,
1040360	1043360	do not make me blind to prove that it's hard.
1043360	1045360	I'm not questioning how hard it is.
1045360	1049360	I just think that I could do a lot of the things that I enjoy doing blind.
1049360	1050360	Really?
1050360	1052360	Then I would finally...
1052360	1056360	Oh, because you're going to hate sunsets and bridges and shit.
1056360	1058360	And also, I'm always forgetting, if you're blind,
1058360	1061360	this sounds like I'm doing blind jokes or something.
1061360	1062360	I'm not really doing that.
1062360	1063360	I'm just thinking in my head, like,
1063360	1067360	if you're blind, then everyone at every party you go to,
1067360	1070360	like, they have to come up and go,
1070360	1073360	Hey, Dan, it's me, Suzanne Johnson,
1073360	1077360	which is something that people don't do because I can allegedly see,
1077360	1079360	even though I can't recognize their fucking face.
1079360	1081360	I never remember anybody.
1081360	1082360	So it might...
1082360	1085360	Again, God, don't take this seriously in a Twilight Zone way,
1085360	1089360	but it might be kind of a lucky break for me to be blind.
1089360	1093360	Because you already suffer from face blindness and other kinds of blindness.
1093360	1097360	It would make the things that make me a prick a lot more excusable.
1097360	1100360	I would rather lose my hearing than my sight,
1100360	1102360	because I'm a more visual guy.
1102360	1104360	I would rather see things and hear them.
1104360	1105360	Yeah.
1110360	1112360	And I'm talking straight to God.
1112360	1114360	God, I fucking dare you.
1114360	1116360	Strike me blind.
1116360	1120360	I was backstage at an event where Channing Tatum, again...
1120360	1121360	Again?
1121360	1122360	The ubiquitous Tatum.
1122360	1124360	I was sad that that story had only one act.
1124360	1126360	So please tell me there's more acts to that story.
1126360	1128360	I was near Jamie Lannister.
1128360	1129360	Oh, shit?
1129360	1131360	Whatever his name is.
1131360	1133360	That hunk of sex.
1134360	1135360	And Erin and I saw him.
1135360	1138360	I really hope Erin doesn't mind me telling the story.
1138360	1140360	She's not here. She won't listen to her.
1140360	1142360	Erin saw him, and she says,
1142360	1143360	Jamie Lannister's over there?
1143360	1145360	And I was like, whoa, holy shit.
1145360	1146360	And then we were like,
1146360	1149360	that fucking Jamie Lannister's really weird to see him.
1151360	1154360	And then Erin said, man, he looks good.
1154360	1158360	And I was like, you know, there's a level of truth to that
1158360	1159360	that supersedes jealousy.
1159360	1162360	I was like, yeah, he does look really good.
1163360	1166360	And this is Erin just expressing how good he looked.
1166360	1168360	I don't want to get her in...
1168360	1170360	I don't know if she'd be mad at me telling this.
1170360	1172360	She says, yeah, he's standing next to Channing Tatum,
1172360	1175360	making him look like a big bag of puke.
1177360	1178360	What's wrong with that?
1178360	1179360	I just don't want...
1179360	1180360	Channing Tatum's eyes are too close together.
1180360	1182360	I don't like that fucking guy.
1183360	1185360	Jamie Lannister is fucking sexy as fuck.
1186360	1189360	When I first saw Game of Thrones, I'm like,
1189360	1193360	that guy, he's almost exhilaratingly good looking.
1194360	1197360	That guy could kick my 10-year-old kid out of window any time.
1197360	1198360	Oh, yeah.
1199360	1200360	Anytime.
1200360	1202360	He could fuck my sister.
1204360	1206360	I'd watch him fuck his sister.
1206360	1211360	I would let him fuck my sister with my chopped-off hand.
1213360	1218360	I'd take his chopped-off hand to a movie.
1222360	1224360	A Channing Tatum movie and just make fun of it.
1224360	1226360	Be like, who's this ugly piece of shit?
1226360	1228360	Looks like a fucking pumpkin.
1230360	1234360	I just think Erin should be able to choose which celebrity
1234360	1237360	she goes on record as calling a bag of puke.
1237360	1238360	It's not her...
1238360	1241360	Look, look, anybody standing next to Jamie Lannister is in deep trouble.
1241360	1242360	I don't care how good looking you are.
1242360	1244360	You're in deep shit if you're standing next to certain people.
1244360	1247360	That guy, he's so good looking that he shouldn't be that good an actor.
1247360	1249360	He also is a good actor.
1249360	1250360	That's fucking terrifying.
1250360	1252360	Yeah, you know he's Spanish or something?
1252360	1253360	What is he?
1253360	1254360	He's Israeli.
1254360	1255360	I have no idea.
1256360	1257360	Did you know he's a Muppet?
1257360	1258360	What is he?
1259360	1260360	Danish.
1260360	1261360	Norwegian.
1261360	1262360	He's Norwegian.
1262360	1263360	He's Swedish.
1263360	1264360	Well, that's close enough.
1265360	1267360	He's across the fjord.
1268360	1269360	He's a hunk.
1269360	1270360	He's good.
1270360	1271360	All right.
1271360	1272360	What a character arc, too.
1272360	1274360	You fucking hated that guy and now you fucking root for him?
1274360	1277360	It's so funny to watch Game of Thrones and then every once in a while
1277360	1281360	just purposely remember that the story started with this guy murdering a child
1282360	1284360	because he saw him fucking his sister.
1285360	1289360	And you're just like, oh, let's go get him, Superman.
1289360	1290360	He's so good looking.
1291360	1292360	You can do no wrong.
1293360	1296360	He's like, oh, I hope his sword lessons go good today.
1301360	1302360	It's a good show.
1303360	1304360	It's a good show.
1304360	1305360	I just started watching Deadwood again.
1306360	1307360	I let enough time pass.
1307360	1308360	I let enough time pass.
1308360	1310360	When I first watched Deadwood, I don't know about you guys.
1311360	1313360	Maybe it's not for everybody, but I watched it.
1314360	1316360	We used to watch it at my place, your place.
1316360	1317360	We'd have little Deadwood parties.
1318360	1322360	And I instantly thought, I wonder how many years has to go by for me to watch this again
1322360	1323360	and enjoy it again.
1324360	1325360	The answer is no.
1325360	1328360	I'm now watching it again and couldn't be happier about it.
1328360	1329360	God damn that show.
1330360	1333360	I'm kind of ready for a Wire rewatch.
1334360	1337360	I'll rewatch Wire with you at any time.
1338360	1341360	Will you rewatch it with me and Jamie Lannister's hand?
1342360	1344360	If you call my dick the Kingslayer.
1349360	1351360	Those are my criteria.
1352360	1357360	Well, let's bring out Game of Thrones and society expert Kumail Nanjiani.
1360360	1372360	I brought you out as soon as I could just to just get into the shade.
1372360	1374360	Did they say the AC was repaired in this place?
1374360	1376360	Oh, is it not on?
1376360	1378360	I think we could.
1378360	1380360	I think that's probably good.
1380360	1381360	It's on.
1381360	1382360	It's on.
1382360	1383360	I feel like Satchmo.
1383360	1385360	Maybe I'm just gaining Satchmo.
1385360	1387360	Louis Armstrong.
1388360	1390360	Are you going to carry around a little talent?
1390360	1393360	I need like a rag.
1393360	1396360	Oh, because that is what he was most known for.
1396360	1397360	The rag.
1398360	1401360	Well, I know he played the horn or something.
1402360	1406360	You're like Satchmo without the historical context and the musical ability.
1408360	1410360	By the way, I looked it up.
1410360	1416360	Minoxidil, which is the ingredient in Rogaine, is very, very poisonous to cats.
1416360	1417360	Yeah.
1417360	1419360	But only six cases have been reported.
1419360	1421360	Four of those died.
1421360	1424360	But then so many people probably don't report it like Chile.
1424360	1426360	Because cats die.
1426360	1430360	I think if a cat dies and you also are going bald, you don't connect those dots.
1430360	1433360	You're like, now I've only got one problem.
1437360	1443360	Also, there was a couple of those people are actually putting Rogaine on their cats.
1444360	1447360	Because their cat is a bald cat or something.
1447360	1448360	That's what I read online.
1448360	1449360	Oh, I read that too.
1449360	1450360	That's crazy.
1450360	1451360	Can I say one?
1451360	1452360	Okay, no.
1452360	1453360	No, say it.
1453360	1454360	Say it.
1454360	1455360	Okay.
1455360	1456360	So this goes back to a little while ago.
1456360	1461360	We had a heated discussion about, and I don't want to bring up like sore subjects, but I
1461360	1467360	thought it was interesting about how we treat people who try to talk to us in public differently.
1467360	1469360	You want to engage and I don't.
1470360	1472360	Like at the airport or something.
1472360	1474360	You're like, Hey, what's your vibe?
1474360	1475360	And I'm like, Hey, fuck off.
1475360	1480360	You know, that's nobody wants to be like, like, like the confronted when you're not
1480360	1481360	ready for it.
1481360	1482360	Right.
1482360	1484360	No, but I mean, just like engage in conversation.
1484360	1488360	And I said, usually when I'm on a plane, I'll ignore the people trying to talk to me.
1488360	1489360	Yeah.
1489360	1490360	On a plane.
1490360	1491360	Fuck everybody.
1491360	1492360	I want to go.
1492360	1496360	I want to pretend that I, I want absolute abject, graveyard silence on a plane.
1496360	1500360	Last week I was flying back from Atlanta and I sit down and an old lady's going to
1500360	1505360	sit next to me and I help her with her bag and I put the bag up and she says, can I'm
1505360	1508360	thinking about what's your approach?
1508360	1511360	And she says, I'm sorry, it's really heavy.
1511360	1514360	You don't want to know what's in there.
1514360	1515360	Now you do.
1515360	1517360	No, I don't know.
1517360	1518360	I do.
1518360	1519360	You want to know.
1519360	1522360	I don't want to know because it's probably a human head.
1522360	1525360	Well, luckily she needs no prompting.
1525360	1528360	She tells me, she's like, it's six pounds of strudel.
1528360	1529360	It's for my son.
1529360	1531360	So now, now I don't want to know anymore.
1531360	1533360	Now I'm at a crossroads.
1533360	1537360	Am I going to engage her or am I just going to sit silently?
1537360	1541360	And because you were so passionate about it, I was like, all right, I'll try this.
1541360	1545360	And I said, huh, might have to fight your son for it.
1545360	1548360	That's what I said.
1548360	1550360	That's not how I would have approached.
1550360	1551360	Well, this is what happened.
1551360	1555360	This is how I got.
1555360	1556360	I have to fight your son for it.
1556360	1557360	And she goes, good luck.
1557360	1558360	He's six three.
1558360	1560360	He's an architect.
1560360	1566360	And that's when I knew I was fucked because she was giving out information that had nothing
1566360	1568360	to do with what we were talking about.
1568360	1570360	Well, he just wanted to.
1570360	1573360	He could build a labyrinth around you.
1573360	1575360	I do need to build a labyrinth around this.
1575360	1578360	There's enough to fight minotaurs or whatever.
1578360	1580360	And then she talked to me the entire time.
1580360	1586360	She said the phrase and when she said my son's an architect, I almost loudly kind of said
1586360	1589360	fuck because I knew I was.
1589360	1592360	And she twice used the phrase.
1592360	1597360	Well, you know, the kind of people that the black community holds up as heroes.
1597360	1602360	And in my head, I was just strangling Jeff.
1602360	1604360	You're you're out there.
1604360	1607360	Jeff, you're out there talking to these fucking people.
1607360	1613360	You're out there fucking feeding gremlins after midnight.
1613360	1616360	And then they go out attacking Phoebe Gates.
1616360	1617360	Phoebe Gates did nothing.
1617360	1618360	I'm Phoebe Gates.
1618360	1619360	Why?
1619360	1620360	You did it wrong.
1620360	1621360	Why?
1621360	1622360	You did it wrong.
1622360	1623360	You got it.
1623360	1624360	You got her wet.
1624360	1625360	You don't get them wet.
1625360	1626360	Oh, you didn't see her.
1626360	1627360	Jesus.
1627360	1628360	She hasn't been wet in a while.
1628360	1630360	I don't mean get her wet like horny.
1630360	1632360	She was in her 70s.
1632360	1634360	It's been a while.
1634360	1641360	Part of the art of talking to the stranger is knowing when to and how to engage.
1641360	1642360	Well, I didn't.
1642360	1647360	I just can't just go willy nilly and talk about strudel and find her sons.
1647360	1648360	I want to find her son.
1648360	1652360	She had every right to come back with six foot two and architect.
1652360	1653360	And then just so much.
1653360	1657360	And I would just look at looking straight and I could just see her like looking at me
1657360	1662360	like as soon as he looks at me, I've got another thing ready to go.
1662360	1665360	If you're on a plane with somebody who's a chatterbox and you want them to stop talking,
1665360	1666360	here's what you do.
1666360	1667360	You look at them.
1667360	1670360	I can't be racist to them because that's just going to score her on.
1670360	1674360	Yeah, well, you're part of the black community.
1674360	1676360	Look at them and go shush.
1676360	1677360	But it was a smile.
1677360	1680360	You go shushy, shushy, shushy pie.
1680360	1681360	Oh, give me a break.
1681360	1682360	No, no, no.
1682360	1689360	If you ever shush another adult, if you put your finger up to your mouth, they go shush.
1689360	1691360	They fucking shut up.
1691360	1693360	Nobody keeps talking when you go.
1693360	1694360	I'm sorry.
1694360	1695360	What's your name?
1695360	1696360	Maria?
1696360	1697360	Maria?
1697360	1698360	Shush.
1698360	1699360	Yeah.
1699360	1700360	Can you shut up?
1700360	1701360	No, no, no.
1701360	1703360	You can pull out a gun.
1703360	1709360	You can say something more racist than her to the point where she thought you were a
1709360	1710360	little extreme.
1710360	1714360	If you're on a plane and you go, look, you say, look, I need to take a nap.
1714360	1715360	I want to read my book.
1715360	1717360	Shut the fuck up.
1717360	1718360	Shut the fuck up.
1718360	1720360	I was on a plane one time and there was an old guy.
1720360	1723360	When I say old, I'll put him at 68.
1723360	1724360	That's my guess on this guy.
1724360	1728360	He was one or two rows behind me and he was talking to another guy.
1728360	1729360	At the top of his fucking lungs.
1729360	1733360	I got the feeling that he was probably a little bit hard of hearing because he was yelling.
1733360	1737360	The other guy was yelling to him because I think that guy thought he was hard of hearing
1737360	1738360	too.
1738360	1741360	I noticed two guys just for a five-hour flight from New York to L.A. just, well, you don't
1741360	1742360	know the thing about fishing.
1742360	1744360	I love to go fishing.
1744360	1747360	Everyone else is fucking sleeping because it's 9 a.m.
1747360	1754360	I just stood up and looked at him and just gave the finger to the lips and went shush.
1755360	1761360	It was fucking boneyard silence after that because I'm 6'2 and I'm an architect.
1763360	1764360	You can't just talk to everybody.
1764360	1766360	That's a real dick move.
1766360	1767360	No.
1767360	1768360	It's a fucking plane.
1768360	1769360	Everybody else was bummed out.
1769360	1773360	Also, no joke, and this is not me grandizing my situation.
1773360	1778360	People came up to me during and after the flight on the plane and then at the baggage
1778360	1779360	claim and came up and said, thank you.
1779360	1781360	You should have been shush.
1781360	1784360	I said, I'll fight your son.
1784360	1787360	You'll fight your son for strudel.
1787360	1788360	I was doing a bet.
1788360	1791360	She loved it.
1791360	1793360	You can't just tap a hornet's nest.
1793360	1794360	I know.
1794360	1796360	You don't rub the lantern, man.
1796360	1797360	You fucking leave it.
1797360	1804360	Aren't we just saying that some of us are good at talking to people.
1804360	1805360	Yeah.
1805360	1809360	Some of us are bad at it, so we don't want to do it.
1810360	1814360	We also talked about, and you were talking about that show several hermitons
1814360	1818360	ago, Camille, where you were saying that you, I think you were doing a bit,
1818360	1823360	where you were saying that you're not gregarious, but you are a very gregarious
1823360	1824360	person.
1824360	1827360	Yeah, but I don't like to talk to people I don't know.
1827360	1828360	I'm fairly friendly.
1828360	1832360	Under any circumstances, you're never curious about a stranger or strike up a
1832360	1835360	conversation with a person next to you?
1835360	1838360	Never once have I initiated a conversation with a stranger.
1838360	1839360	I'm pretty sure.
1839360	1841360	So you tried it because of me and you were fucking...
1841360	1844360	And look what happened.
1844360	1849360	The kind of people that the black community holds up as heroes.
1849360	1852360	You're a curious guy.
1852360	1856360	I was in Nashville recently last week where I wasn't here the last time in town
1856360	1857360	and we had a cab driver.
1857360	1859360	It was an Uber.
1859360	1860360	I'll talk to cab drivers.
1860360	1862360	Yeah, because, yeah, well, that's a stranger.
1862360	1864360	Yeah, I will talk to them.
1864360	1867360	And I was in the front seat and everyone else in the back seat and he was kind
1867360	1868360	of an oddball.
1868360	1872360	He was a guy that, I think he gave me a business card.
1872360	1877360	He is a guy that is absolutely certain that global warming is not happening.
1877360	1880360	And he's a filmmaker and also an Uber driver.
1880360	1883360	So he's an Uber driver.
1883360	1887360	Well, look, lots of filmmakers are Uber drivers potentially.
1887360	1891360	Yeah, that's what I saw Spielberg the other day.
1891360	1893360	No, no, he was just a privileged...
1893360	1898360	I would rather watch a movie by a guy that used to be an Uber driver or still is.
1898360	1904360	But he was saying like, well, you know, that 80% of scientists are emphatically
1904360	1907360	agree that global warming is not happening.
1907360	1909360	And I said, is that right?
1909360	1913360	I said, I've heard people say that 90-something percent of scientists agree
1913360	1914360	that it is.
1914360	1916360	He goes, no, that's what Al Gore wants you to do.
1916360	1920360	And my movie is called An Inconvenient Lie.
1920360	1921360	Ah, nice.
1921360	1923360	He flipped it.
1923360	1928360	Why shouldn't he call it a convenient lie?
1928360	1933360	Maybe a convenient truth.
1933360	1934360	I don't know.
1934360	1937360	He's between shots right now because, you know, the weather's shitty.
1937360	1938360	He can't shoot anything.
1938360	1941360	So he's driving his Uber around with the air conditioning on.
1941360	1943360	But he's saying like, he's like, no.
1943360	1945360	And I said, but aren't like...
1945360	1946360	And I was not going to try to like...
1946360	1949360	I don't have enough information to shout him down about that.
1949360	1950360	But I said, but aren't like...
1950360	1953360	Isn't there like satellite imagery of ice shelves falling off?
1953360	1954360	And isn't that kind of proof?
1954360	1957360	Like that's an unprecedented kind of unstoppable rate.
1957360	1959360	And he goes, no, no.
1959360	1960360	He goes, that's an absolute lie.
1960360	1962360	And he was very level-headed about it.
1962360	1967360	And he said, every time an Antarctic ice shelf falls off,
1967360	1969360	one grows in the Arctic Ocean.
1969360	1971360	Oh.
1971360	1974360	That is very inspiring.
1974360	1976360	And I was like, for real?
1976360	1977360	He goes, yeah.
1977360	1979360	He goes like, nature has a balance.
1979360	1982360	And when one falls off, it creates another ice shelf.
1982360	1988360	Like, I was like, give me your email address that I have to see this movie.
1988360	1992360	I want to premiere that movie about the guy that is certain that humans,
1992360	1996360	humans not only don't have an impact on the environment, they couldn't.
1996360	1998360	Has he been making it already?
1998360	1999360	Or he wants to make it?
1999360	2002360	I got the feeling that this is almost like it's done.
2002360	2003360	They're imposed on this.
2003360	2004360	Oh, yeah?
2004360	2005360	Huh.
2005360	2006360	I want to see it.
2006360	2007360	I want to see it, too.
2007360	2008360	Yeah, I really want to see it.
2008360	2011360	But if you didn't talk to strangers, you would never know there's a guy that is certain
2011360	2015360	that scientists all agree that humans are having no impact on the environment.
2015360	2017360	I'm sure there are guys like that out there.
2017360	2019360	I just don't want to really talk to them.
2019360	2023360	But if they make a movie, I'll watch it.
2023360	2024360	And how would you know about it?
2024360	2025360	About the movie?
2025360	2026360	Yeah.
2026360	2031360	I'm friends with you.
2031360	2032360	You're our emissary.
2032360	2033360	Go out and collect the nuggets.
2034360	2039360	I find it hard to believe that you could be sitting next to people at an airport or anywhere
2039360	2041360	and not lean over and talk to people.
2041360	2045360	Because you're such a garrulous, friendly guy.
2045360	2047360	I don't talk to people at airports.
2047360	2048360	That's bullshit.
2048360	2049360	I know.
2049360	2050360	But that's at airports.
2050360	2051360	Like at a restaurant, a bar.
2051360	2053360	You don't ever look over and go, hey.
2053360	2055360	You just never strike up conversation?
2055360	2056360	No.
2056360	2057360	Ever.
2057360	2058360	No.
2058360	2061360	Maybe that's why I'm not a stand-up.
2061360	2064360	I've never been moved to write jokes, go up on stage, and do that.
2064360	2066360	Maybe that's like a...
2066360	2068360	I get it all out.
2068360	2070360	To be a stand-up maybe is a thing.
2070360	2072360	Oh, you're getting it out.
2072360	2073360	Oh, okay.
2073360	2075360	So if you didn't talk to people, maybe you...
2075360	2076360	I'd be funnier.
2076360	2078360	No, you'd be doing stand-up.
2078360	2079360	I don't know.
2079360	2086360	Well, I would like to get a Comic-Con report from the king of Comic-Con 2014, Spencer Crittenden.
2092360	2093360	Whoo!
2099360	2100360	Hey, guys.
2100360	2101360	Hey.
2101360	2102360	Hey.
2103360	2104360	Whoa.
2104360	2105360	Hey, Spencer.
2105360	2106360	How you doing, man?
2106360	2107360	That was good.
2107360	2110360	I thought that vocal was someone yelling at me.
2110360	2111360	What vocal?
2111360	2113360	The vocal in that song that was playing.
2113360	2115360	The song is called Loudmouth by Ray Kondo.
2115360	2117360	It sure was.
2119360	2120360	Comic-Con.
2120360	2121360	Yeah, what happened?
2121360	2122360	Give us the scoop.
2122360	2124360	My feet hurt.
2125360	2126360	Did you enjoy yourself?
2126360	2127360	Yeah.
2127360	2128360	Give me a...
2128360	2129360	What was your highlight?
2129360	2130360	Was there a highlight mode for you?
2130360	2133360	I got to play Super Smash Brothers.
2133360	2135360	The new one is Mega Man.
2135360	2139360	That's all I've ever wanted to do with my entire life.
2140360	2141360	It was great.
2141360	2142360	It was great.
2142360	2146360	The convention was packed, packed more than ever, and there was more than ever signs saying
2146360	2150360	you couldn't do stuff, and more than ever people telling you what to do.
2150360	2152360	And it was kind of a bummer.
2152360	2154360	And where I remember there used to be booths where it's all like,
2154360	2156360	oh, get a free USB drive.
2156360	2158360	Here, have a free sticker.
2158360	2161360	Now it's like, win a raffle to get a sticker.
2161360	2164360	And it's just, like, it's getting cheapened.
2164360	2165360	I don't know.
2165360	2167360	There was a new development this year that was just...
2167360	2170360	If I hadn't crossed a threshold in my head where I was like,
2170360	2174360	look, I'm just another rich douche here promoting things.
2174360	2179360	I'm not going to look at myself as one of the nerds anymore.
2179360	2182360	I'm looking at myself as an exploiter of nerds.
2182360	2184360	I've got two shows I'm promoting here.
2184360	2186360	I'm getting driven around in SUVs.
2186360	2188360	Let's be real.
2188360	2194360	My experience at Comic-Con, if it's good, is great for me and not for anyone else in particular.
2194360	2200360	It was one thing that I let get to me as a nerd of old,
2200360	2205360	which was just like, now they just station these guys,
2205360	2210360	who I couldn't describe any way else other than to just call them gym teacher types.
2210360	2214360	I mean, I don't know who else goes into security at a convention center.
2214360	2218360	And they're peppered like every 30 feet throughout the convention center
2218360	2225360	and they're literally just yelling at a sea of nerds, keep it moving.
2225360	2228360	And they do it indiscriminately when people are moving,
2228360	2232360	when they're not, when there's heavy traffic areas, when there's no people in an aisle.
2232360	2236360	So we already know you can't sit on the floor at Comic-Con, which used to be,
2236360	2238360	this is my big thing that I've always had a problem with.
2238360	2242360	I went to SuperCon in Miami. I went to New York Comic-Con.
2242360	2246360	You can still see what is a beautiful thing to me,
2246360	2250360	which is this is our people, you know, this is the way we pray.
2250360	2255360	We buy a bunch of shit with our enormously disposable income because no one's dating us.
2256360	2259360	We consume the fuck out of stuff.
2259360	2263360	And when we get exhausted from buying your shit,
2263360	2268360	we plop our fat asses down on the carpet against the nearest stretch of wall
2268360	2271360	and we look through it until we can get a bit of strength
2271360	2273360	and take another surge through this stuff.
2273360	2277360	And we're dressed like the Monopoly guy and pirates and spider people.
2277360	2280360	And, you know, it's like, it used to be, and then it's like,
2280360	2281360	okay, you can't sit on the floor anymore.
2281360	2286360	Okay, well, yeah, that's because, you know, Bruce Willis's PR team's coming through.
2286360	2289360	And now I'm part of that problem too, so I dropped that.
2289360	2290360	I dropped that passion.
2290360	2293360	If you want to sit on the floor, go to New York.
2293360	2296360	But keep it moving. Keep it moving.
2296360	2297360	I can't fucking move.
2297360	2300360	You guys are making too much money for me to move.
2300360	2303360	That's fucking crazy. Keep it moving.
2303360	2305360	That's exactly what a gym teacher says.
2306360	2310360	In that vein, a lot of the traffic signals were shut down
2310360	2314360	and they had like traffic enforcement, you know, directing traffic and stuff.
2314360	2319360	And I always thought it was pretty weird because they call them traffic enforcement officers,
2319360	2322360	but they're really more like traffic naggers.
2322360	2326360	Like they just like tell you what to do and if you don't, they're like,
2326360	2330360	and then just everyone continues doing it, like what they're going to do.
2330360	2333360	They don't actually stop people. They never cite anyone.
2333360	2335360	There's like five people at the same intersection.
2335360	2339360	You think one of them can go tackle someone, like it wouldn't be that hard.
2339360	2341360	They're not really enforcing anything.
2341360	2346360	Yeah, I saw a lot of people, a lot of like mob rule happening at the crosswalks,
2346360	2347360	which is kind of a nice thing.
2347360	2351360	Like people just crawling under the cross, cross arms on the railroad track.
2351360	2354360	Well, did you see that accident that happened?
2354360	2357360	And this family of deaf people got beat up by nerds at Comic Con?
2357360	2358360	What?
2358360	2359360	This happened yesterday.
2359360	2361360	So there was an accident?
2362360	2364360	Damn deaf people.
2367360	2368360	So you chose wisely.
2371360	2377360	But they were driving a car, which would be significantly more challenging if you were blind,
2377360	2383360	but they so they were waiting at a crosswalk and it was the zombie run was happening.
2383360	2386360	So this guy had little kids who couldn't hear that.
2386360	2392360	Then suddenly people in amazing like zombie outfits keep coming by and these kids start freaking out.
2392360	2393360	It's taking a long time.
2393360	2397360	So he starts like nudging his car forward because there's no rule.
2397360	2401360	And they started attacking the car and breaking the windshield and stuff.
2402360	2402360	
2402360	2406360	And so he like tried to get away and hit an old lady.
2406360	2407360	Why was an old lady there?
2407360	2410360	I don't know, but she broke her arm and nobody died.
2410360	2412360	But I saw it.
2412360	2417360	It's funny because I was over at a pizza place watching like that procession go by.
2417360	2420360	And then it kept being interrupted by all these emergency vehicles.
2420360	2421360	And that's what that was.
2421360	2423360	Yeah, they were going to attend to that.
2423360	2428360	But it was funny because you see this parade and then it gets like pushed off into the sidewalk
2428360	2429360	and then they keep going like nothing happened.
2429360	2430360	I became part of that.
2430360	2432360	I was kind of bummed out about it.
2432360	2439360	Like it's just like it seemed like all of the there's just a sea of what I perceived as San Diego natives
2439360	2447360	who are all eating at restaurants with their cameras out watching really extra slow nerds walk by them.
2447360	2449360	And I was like part of this fucking parade.
2449360	2451360	I'm like, this is the worst.
2451360	2453360	Like I'm hungry.
2453360	2454360	Not for human flesh.
2454360	2457360	I'm going to meet people.
2457360	2458360	But I couldn't.
2458360	2462360	You can't like knock over a stroller with a zombie baby in it.
2462360	2465360	And like I'm going by.
2465360	2467360	I do love going though, even with all that.
2467360	2470360	Like you see when the people are dressed up and stuff, it's very exciting.
2470360	2474360	Like there's still a lot of passionate people around and they're getting yelled at by gym teachers.
2474360	2476360	But they're still there.
2476360	2477360	I had a great time.
2477360	2480360	I mean, again, as I say, big asterisk at the top of all this.
2480360	2484360	I've become some strange, protected, elitist astronaut.
2484360	2489360	I land at Comic Con and I'm, you know, I'm handled now.
2489360	2491360	I'm escorted to the place I used to be.
2491360	2495360	You're seeing parts of the convention center that nobody gets to see like in the behind the thing.
2496360	2499360	I get to see Channing Tatum in an elevator and do bits.
2499360	2502360	But but but so for me, everything was seamless.
2502360	2510360	And every single person I'm meeting is someone who is moved to speak to me because they they they so admire me.
2510360	2515360	So it's like my experience is like it's like, you know, it's insanely biased.
2515360	2517360	But I was a really great comic.
2517360	2520360	Do you think you could sit down and someone wouldn't tell you to keep it moving?
2520360	2521360	I know.
2521360	2524360	Well, there was a moment like after I finished the Adult Swim signing, it was kind of weird.
2524360	2529360	Like I was sort of like this fat old guy, my gray stringy hair.
2529360	2535360	And I had had like vodka is delivered to me while I was signing stuff by Justin's assistant tomorrow.
2535360	2536360	Thank you tomorrow.
2538360	2540360	And I was done with the signing.
2540360	2546360	And it was like no one cared that I had a glass of vodka on the rocks at the signing table.
2546360	2549360	And so and then when it was over, I just kind of wandered off with it.
2549360	2554360	So for a moment there, I was kind of just strolling through the exhibit hall with this cocktail in my hand.
2554360	2561360	And I did kind of feel like the king of something because there was no nobody was telling me you're not allowed to do that.
2561360	2563360	It's like, of course, you can't have like glassware.
2563360	2564360	Yeah.
2564360	2566360	But it was filled with booze.
2566360	2568360	I felt like Dean Martin or something.
2569360	2571360	I don't know if I last year this happened.
2571360	2578360	I don't know if I talked about it here, but women have like a different experience that women like get groped and stuff that happens.
2578360	2580360	I was walking with a comic.
2581360	2583360	There was a new thing there this year.
2583360	2586360	I mean, it's not a new thing, a new new awareness of it.
2588360	2589360	What's the Twitter handle?
2590360	2592360	Cosplay is not consent.
2592360	2593360	Well, cosplay is not consent is the slogan.
2593360	2594360	There's a Twitter.
2594360	2596360	There's a Twitter account.
2596360	2597360	Is it really a thing?
2597360	2598360	Cosplay is not consent.
2598360	2599360	It's not.
2600360	2607360	But women like dress up in cosplay and guys think it's OK to treat them like, you know, like cartoons, like cartoons.
2607360	2608360	Like cartoons.
2608360	2609360	Yeah.
2609360	2610360	Well, not that.
2611360	2612360	They objectify them.
2612360	2613360	Like not people.
2613360	2614360	Yeah.
2614360	2618360	If a girl is dressed as poison ivy, then obviously it's OK to just run up to her and go like, hey, how are you?
2619360	2624360	Or can I let me get a picture without actually engaging them like a human being because they're dressed as poison ivy.
2624360	2626360	But you said that they're actually being handled in gropes.
2626360	2627360	There's reports of that.
2627360	2628360	Yeah.
2628360	2630360	Well, last year I was walking and it was me and Emily.
2630360	2636360	We were walking and Emily was like, this guy keeps like she felt.
2636360	2643360	She's some guy like sort of was like really close to her, his crotch on a weird.
2643360	2644360	Yeah.
2644360	2651360	So I look back expecting like a huge crowd, but it was just me and Emily and then one guy behind her and no one else around.
2651360	2652360	Just the three of us walking.
2652360	2654360	And I was like, what the fuck, dude?
2655360	2656360	Yeah.
2656360	2658360	Just mounting her as you're walking around.
2658360	2661360	Well, I mean, it was Jamie Lannister.
2661360	2662360	She was fine with it.
2663360	2666360	No, it was like me and her and just like one dude behind it.
2666360	2667360	When I looked, he went away.
2667360	2672360	But we just expected like to be a huge crowd and people getting pushed around.
2672360	2674360	But is it geeks for consent?
2674360	2686360	Yeah, that was the Twitter thing I was I was I was looking at in the limo ride home from my privileged flying saucer that I hover over.
2686360	2689360	You know, but yeah, geeks for consent there.
2689360	2690360	They're there.
2690360	2695360	It's a it's a it's a small group of people from what I've been able to gather from reading their updates and things.
2695360	2701360	What it is is that San Diego Comic Con there as an official from an official PR perspective.
2701360	2704360	Like they don't want to create the idea that this is a problem.
2704360	2709360	So they'd rather just wait until something terrible, whatever, whatever their position is.
2709360	2713360	And that's what that's what these these this group is running up against.
2713360	2726360	They're saying, can we just add can we make the one formal step of adding official thorough anti harassment language to the Comic Con guidelines?
2726360	2730360	You know, like what it what constitutes it and how it'll be dealt with and all that stuff.
2730360	2732360	I think they have like one sentence in there.
2732360	2733360	It's like, don't harass people.
2733360	2738360	You know, is it for all women or just for women that choose to dress up in cosplay outfits?
2738360	2744360	I mean, I would guess all women. I would think you'd have to dress up a sailor moon to not be sexually harassed.
2744360	2746360	You know what I mean? I bet it would be all women.
2746360	2748360	I think it's just all human beings.
2748360	2753360	I think as with anywhere, you just need to you're allowed to feel safe if you choose to dress up as a character.
2753360	2760360	You're not necessarily saying to strangers that they have an elevated level of permission with you in a social context.
2760360	2764360	They're just saying, I mean, that makes perfect sense to me.
2764360	2778360	Yeah. And just all this group is asking is, can you please add that language to the big long list of warnings about don't wear your Google glasses when you watch the next Hugh Jackman movie at the panel?
2778360	2780360	You know, they're very thorough about that.
2780360	2782360	What will happen to you in anti piracy and stuff?
2782360	2793360	Not so thorough about just letting somebody know, don't run up to Sailor Moon, throw your hand around her waist, take a selfie, talk to her like she's Sailor Moon.
2793360	2798360	You know, like, like, like it's a person. And yeah, that's it.
2798360	2803360	So I thought that was interesting as our world keeps changing under our feet.
2803360	2806360	Spencer, do you have a low light of the Comic Con?
2806360	2813360	Yeah. I like to shame Hasbro Incorporated.
2813360	2814360	It's high time.
2814360	2824360	Yeah. They have this situation where like they had a booth that was like a store like many other stores in the Comic Con situation.
2824360	2838360	But this booth was special because in order to get the privilege of lining up in the ridiculously long line to buy the merch, you had to get these tickets elsewhere at a completely different place, like at six in the morning.
2838360	2841360	And that's to buy stuff at the store.
2841360	2850360	And that's before the Comic Con even opens. So it's like get to Comic Con three hours before they open so you could get a ticket so you can stand in line to buy this shit.
2850360	2851360	And it was a bummer.
2851360	2853360	What were you planning to buy from Hasbro?
2853360	2858360	Promotional magic card stuff because Hasbro bought Wizards of the Coast, so they own magic and stuff.
2858360	2859360	Uh huh.
2859360	2871360	It's a bummer. But on a highlight related note, I got to go to a weird magic event hosted by Geek and Sundry and I got to play magic with just some new players, but also this guy.
2871360	2877360	Shit. I think his name was Doug Beyer, but he's a magic, you know, executive guy and I got to see one of them.
2877360	2878360	Did they know who you were?
2878360	2880360	No, no, no, it was cool.
2880360	2883360	Did you have any reflect reflected celebrity from from being a?
2883360	2890360	Yeah, I mean, I probably there's probably about 40 people that stop me and talk to me from recognizing me from harm in town or from TV. It was cool.
2890360	2894360	I bet a lot of other dudes with ponytails and big beers also got stopped.
2894360	2895360	I bet they did.
2895360	2898360	I know there's yesterday. No, you didn't.
2898360	2901360	There was about three or four people that were like, did I see you?
2901360	2903360	And then I was like, I don't know. Did you?
2903360	2905360	And then they're like, I don't know.
2905360	2907360	And I was like, you watch TV and they're like, no.
2907360	2914360	I was like, well, a lot of people just generally look like this, like with a crazy beard and long hair and glasses and fat.
2914360	2915360	They thought you were.
2915360	2917360	They thought you were a Hammurabi.
2917360	2921360	Yeah. I mean, I have a coat.
2921360	2928360	I was I hope I'm not speaking on a term and telling the Justin story in the elevator.
2928360	2933360	Justin Roylan, the co-creator Rick and where he was really drunk and he got into it.
2933360	2939360	He got into an elevator and he's just he's he's just he goes through a curtain.
2939360	2940360	He's a great drunk.
2940360	2942360	Yeah, it's great in air quotes.
2942360	2950360	You know, he's he's a big drunk and and he like there was a guy in the elevator that was I think in a wheelchair.
2950360	2952360	I'm hearing this story third hand.
2952360	2958360	And and and he he just was just being big and gregarious and stuff.
2958360	2963360	And he kind of he was sort of like putting a hand on the guy's shoulder and saying, you know, yeah, isn't that right or whatever?
2963360	2972360	Kind of like inviting everyone to the party in the elevator, kind of like, like, let's all hang out in the elevator right now and be friends and look at how drunk I am.
2972360	2977360	And the third time he did like the guy, the guy said, like, look, you're really invading my space right now.
2977360	2981360	I'm very uncomfortable. And Justin was like, oh, shit, sorry.
2981360	2991360	You got really quiet. And then he said, he said, listen, I don't know if you're like a fan of Adventure Time or like that.
2991360	3002360	And the guy cut him off and said, I know who you are. Oh, oh, shit.
3002360	3011360	Pack a snap. Pack a snap. Wow. That could not have gone any word.
3011360	3016360	Yeah, that was that elevator just became a crater.
3016360	3020360	I wouldn't let Jamie Lannister touch me this much.
3020360	3024360	Wow. I want to I saw I saw an old friend of ours.
3024360	3028360	We haven't had him on the show in a while at Comic Con and he's looking and feeling great.
3028360	3032360	So I told him come down and I give us a little update because it seems like it's all good news.
3032360	3046360	Let's welcome back. Seek Donnelly.
3046360	3054360	We all remember this guy, multiple aneurysm survivor who the last time we saw you was snuggling.
3054360	3057360	Oh, yeah, you're kind of you're kind of invading Camille.
3057360	3065360	I know who you are. I do that at Comic Con. I press my junk against people.
3065360	3070360	And then and then when they turn around and go, what are you doing? You go, I survived multiple aneurysms.
3070360	3073360	I have earned this. I play that card. Yeah.
3073360	3083360	The last time we talked to you, it was very sobering and I mean, not technically for me, but but emotionally sobering.
3083360	3094360	The declaration on your part that you had been going to these doctors who were studying you and in the same course, treating you while they studied you,
3094360	3099360	you know, putting coils up your legs and stuff. I can't even imagine.
3099360	3103360	I just all I know is a Rogaine could kill my cat. So I've got it bad.
3103360	3110360	The and you were told them, let's just let's knock it off because there was a little bit of time that you weren't on the treatments.
3110360	3120360	And you felt more creative and you were like, I mean, the way that you had put it, or at least the way I've seen articles written about it is that even if it's a crass way of saying it,
3120360	3127360	you're like, I want to I want to be creative, even if it kills me, because you're you're recognizing that you're not getting this treatment anymore.
3127360	3130360	And it's sort of like a roll of the dice with whatever's going on in your brain.
3130360	3135360	And you but you're the effects of the treatment were kind of neutering you creatively.
3135360	3139360	Am I getting any of this wrong? No, that's all exactly what was going on.
3139360	3144360	So you came out here last time and said, all right, no more treatments and and off I go.
3144360	3151360	And I'm going to go draw stuff and be productive and come what may. And so now you can now you give us the update.
3151360	3158360	Well, yeah, so I mean, I've my energy levels been up. I've been having fewer incidents of as far as like blackouts and seizures.
3158360	3167360	I still have some, but they're few and far between. Basically, I can I seem to be thinking a lot more.
3167360	3175360	I'm solving like because a lot of things I do is like I buy puzzles and solve puzzles and like to help my brain still sponge.
3175360	3180360	It's absorbing. I build transformers and, you know, and model kits and everything like that.
3180360	3183360	So I love doing all that stuff. And it keeps the creative juices going.
3183360	3187360	Now I've found that I can't stop. I'm getting very little sleep.
3187360	3192360	I'm probably sleeping like three hours a night, maybe. And I can't shut my brain down.
3192360	3202360	And it's just it's it's nonstop going and I'm productive like I'm doing a lot now a lot more than I did before I had an aneurysm at one time.
3202360	3210360	And and there are effects that it's having on me, but they're again so far few and far between that I'm I don't know.
3210360	3216360	I seem to be what I've always wanted to be, which is a little superhuman lately.
3216360	3220360	Is it a worry that you're not sleeping enough? Like would you like to be able to shut that down a little bit?
3220360	3228360	Yeah, I would love to. We tried a couple of things. I actually a couple of things about a month ago, I had sleep deprivation because I was up for a couple of days.
3228360	3233360	And then and then after that, I got, you know, some some stuff to knock me out.
3233360	3238360	And then since then, I've been I'll get three hours sleep at night and then sometimes I'll take an hour nap in the middle of the day.
3238360	3241360	But my energy level like we just did Comic Con last year.
3241360	3245360	I think I sat two days out because I was sick this year.
3245360	3248360	I could have gone three more days. Really? Yeah, that's great.
3248360	3253360	What about like loud noises and stuff like when you're in big crowds and people are getting kind of loud?
3253360	3259360	Yeah, I used to walk around with headsets on at cons and I would listen to like water flowing and it would drown everything out.
3259360	3268360	Now the noise sounds like water flowing. So even all the yelling and the screaming and the body odor and the everything.
3268360	3271360	Do your doctors have any do they weigh in on that?
3271360	3278360	Well, I only have the one neurologist now and he's not he never gave me advice and stuff on that level.
3278360	3281360	It was always the other Dr. Guinea pig doctors.
3281360	3283360	Is there anything for them to learn off of this?
3283360	3286360	If I still went to them, maybe. Really? Yeah.
3286360	3289360	What's your doctor's take on everything?
3289360	3295360	I mean, he's he's kind of a pothead. So he's like, yeah.
3295360	3298360	Transformers. Transformers. Transformers.
3298360	3302360	I would take three Doritos and call me in the morning.
3302360	3307360	Do the other doctors try and contact you like an ex-girlfriend or something like that?
3307360	3310360	How's it going? Are you still, you know, with the brain?
3310360	3314360	Just get coffee and see. No, no, no, I don't. We don't.
3314360	3318360	They don't reach out to me. Well, that's fantastic. What are you up to creatively?
3318360	3323360	Well, I'm working on the book. I mentioned that you guys all helped me fund on Kickstarter.
3323360	3327360	Alon Vitale, which is me doing all the different art styles.
3327360	3331360	I just recently choreographed a dance for the book.
3331360	3333360	Basically, I'm trying to find out what kind of artist I am.
3333360	3343360	So every page in the book is a different type of art, expressionism, surrealism, sculpting, painting, singing, choreography, film making.
3343360	3345360	So so it's a very transmedia book.
3345360	3356360	So I've been working on that. And then I actually premiered my new comic at Comic Con called Mono Man.
3356360	3360360	How is your is your visual memory still where it was or is that coming back for you?
3360360	3363360	Yes. Oh, thank you. Yeah, my visual memory.
3363360	3367360	So I've been having more dreams. I can remember them.
3367360	3374360	And I've actually at Comic Con, I drew four people came out to me and commissioned me to do sketches for them.
3374360	3377360	And only two of them actually had to look at pictures for.
3377360	3381360	I actually drew Spider-Man without even looking at him, like seeing a picture of him.
3381360	3385360	I was able to know enough in my head to draw Spider-Man.
3385360	3392360	So so I would say, again, it's finally getting past that sponge level and I'm learning.
3392360	3395360	Yeah, I don't want to go. I mean, I'm going to go out on a limb here.
3395360	3401360	But you know, you ran into me the other day at Comic Con, you know, and you were with a guy who didn't know me.
3401360	3403360	Right. So did you recognize me? Yes.
3403360	3406360	Yeah, which didn't happen in the past like at all. Right.
3406360	3410360	I mean, sometimes I know you're crazy. Yeah. The way I awesome.
3410360	3413360	Yeah. The way I found you this time, I wouldn't have been able to before.
3413360	3416360	Yeah. We were just walking by and I looked over and I go, oh, there's Spencer.
3416360	3418360	Yeah. I'm going to go say hi to him. It's amazing.
3418360	3424360	Yeah. Same with Dan. I mean, same with you.
3424360	3430360	Oh, yeah. Yeah. When I saw you at the signing and stuff and I saw Dustin, too, I just it's starting to like, I don't know.
3430360	3436360	I don't know. It's a stick. And when I see you, like I always I always get the impression that you recognize me and see me and know who I am.
3436360	3440360	Well, yeah, because a lot of times what I do is I get things down. I know you're tall and I knew you wear a suit.
3440360	3447360	And if I see you at that does narrow most of the people we hang out with don't fit that.
3447360	3453360	Yeah. So if I'm in meltdown and I see that I'm pretty much like or if I'm at a bar and I see that I like, you know, I'm also here.
3453360	3456360	And here includes you in two. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
3457360	3463360	How do you recognize me? Your speech pattern. Oh, nice.
3463360	3470360	Nice sidestep, bro. We all know what you really do.
3470360	3475360	We're going to we're going to expunge racism from aneurysm survivors.
3475360	3484360	We've got a new strategy about this. We've figured out it's too deeply rooted in society and we're just we're going to start with seek and make sure he's not racist.
3485360	3490360	This is all your art in here. I know. I know. I'm actually the writer of this book.
3490360	3494360	I. So like I said before, I think I told you about it. It's really hard for me to find a job.
3494360	3499360	A lot of people don't want to hire a guy who has memory problems because they're like, hey, did you do that thing yesterday?
3499360	3506360	And I go, what thing? And then it doesn't get done. So I have a really great boss who is actually here in the audience.
3506360	3511360	I brought him with me. His name's Omar Spahi. And he started a comic company called OSM Comics.
3511360	3517360	And and he hired me as an editor in chief for him, which is always wanted to do with comics, to be an editor.
3517360	3522360	And then he was crazy enough to say, hey, do you want to write one of these comics that we're publishing?
3522360	3526360	So I did. I'm a big, you know, like you, a Joseph Campbell fan. I wanted to do something.
3526360	3533360	I just straight up called it mono myth. I called a spade a spade. And it's the story of Lucifer and Michael in reverse.
3533360	3538360	So actually, Lucifer tells Adam and Eve not to eat the apple. And Michael's the angel that falls from heaven.
3538360	3542360	So it's like a what if earth book because I'm a big Marvel what if fan.
3542360	3549360	And it's got a Nerdist.com did a great review on it and a lot of, you know, got a lot of press NPR.
3549360	3555360	Someone was really nice to NPR and did an interview with me about this and and Elan Vitao and Soulstar.
3555360	3562360	So, yeah, it's definitely getting a lot of controversy. We had the religious protesters outside Comic Con.
3563360	3566360	I love those guys. I made a friend with one of them, actually. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
3566360	3572360	Yeah. I recorded a video of him. He donated to Soulstar. So you're not all bad. Those guys are so I don't know.
3572360	3584360	It's like if you walk by, if you hang out there long enough, there's going to be somebody of equally confusing, equally confusing conviction that starts to yell at them and argue with them.
3584360	3591360	It's like, I don't know what's at stake for either of you, but it's like a guy saying, like, you know, why did why should Jesus have?
3591360	3595360	Why should you need more superpowers than Jesus gave you? Like just some debt.
3595360	3602360	It's like, come on. What are you talking? No one's coming to this convention because they don't want Jesus to be loved.
3602360	3606360	It's not a convention. Yeah. Hating Jesus. Yes. Superman.
3607360	3614360	God can't wear a cape. What are you talking about? Have you ever been in there? Have you ever read a comic book?
3614360	3621360	Do you know what the best origin story was? Yeah. I've got a sequel for you.
3621360	3634360	Reboot this. Christopher Nolan. It's really weird. And then there was a guy who just sat up with a he had a lawn chair and a boombox.
3634360	3643360	He was just blaring what sounded to me like it was just a bad recording of his church's like rock band or something.
3643360	3649360	So it was just like he was just and I just he just thought he could bathe people in positive energy.
3649360	3656360	He didn't regard it as noise pollution at all. It's just like it's already loud here and insufferable and he's just blaring garbage at people.
3656360	3665360	It's a garbled garbage on a cassette tape. It's now I feel bad because he was blaring the song I wrote for Elan Vitao.
3666360	3674360	You write Christian Rock music now? That's my thing, man. What if you found out that was your art? That would blow.
3677360	3689360	Good news, bad news. What have you made us all start loving Christian Rock? That became a new thing. Then I would be the Antichrist, probably.
3689360	3697360	It's true. The Antichrist, I mean, you know, you're not really Spencer. He was just talking about this, according to according to all reports and revelations.
3697360	3705360	The Antichrist, you know, his his big point of efficacy is going to be that everybody really likes him a lot because he's like really kind of nice and charming.
3705360	3714360	Yeah. Yeah. People might think he's like the Messiah, I think, if I read right. So it's just like, well, whatever one looks like the next Jesus, that's get him.
3714360	3725360	Yeah. So and wait and wait for some shithead. Yeah, that's bad mouthing to give that guy your everlasting faith.
3725360	3733360	There's quite a problem when you realize it. Yeah, that is true. That's really funny. That's right. That's why that Jesus doesn't want to come back.
3733360	3741360	He's like, they're going to fucking they're going to get me. How do you jump into this double dutch? Red hot peppers shit.
3742360	3749360	Do you remember what we were saying that listening to like heavy metal music backwards had like satanic messages in it or whatever?
3749360	3757360	I don't know. I just thought it's funny that like Satan is up there like these are the fucking people. This is what they're doing.
3757360	3765360	They're like sitting around smoking pot, listening to music backwards. Like they're not like the best, most productive members of society.
3766360	3775360	When I was a kid, when I was a little kid, there was there was the D and D report, like the news was talking about people that played this thing called Dungeons and Dragons.
3775360	3783360	And they were playing it in my town. And when I was a little kid in Tustin in Orange County, there were these big sewers that you could go hang out.
3783360	3794360	And if you were a teenager, if you were a if you are a martial artist turtle, which I am.
3795360	3799360	But there were reports that people were there were ritual slayings and there was no.
3799360	3804360	Well, that's how the West Memphis three thing happened. That came from that kind of fear.
3804360	3813360	Yeah, it was the Dallas Egbert. The third, whatever his name was, was like it was the kid that went missing from UCLA.
3814360	3818360	Now I'm just spreading rumors. This is the 80s. There was a kid that went missing.
3818360	3826360	Dallas Egbert, the third. His name was Dallas Egbert Jr. or something like that. There was a book. It's called The Dungeon Master.
3826360	3830360	It was published in the 80s by this guy, William Deere, who was a private investigator. Dallas Egbert.
3831360	3837360	Something like that. The third, which means someone else's name. This is a good enough name.
3841360	3844360	If it ain't broke. He was a kid that went missing from a college campus.
3844360	3850360	He was like one of those worms or archetypes. He was there. He was at college way early because he was a genius.
3850360	3857360	And because he was a genius, he was also kind of, you know, he was he had wanderlust and rebellion and boredom and stuff.
3857360	3863360	And he just disappeared one day. And because it was like at the apex of this, what is this judges and dragons thing?
3863360	3867360	All of this urban legends started emanating out of this kid's disappearance.
3868360	3873360	You know, they play Dungeons and Dragons in the steam tunnels underneath the college's campus.
3873360	3877360	And he was one of the people that was doing this. And that's why he's disappeared.
3877360	3885360	And the whole book is written by this private investigator who specialized in cult deprogramming, which was the most recent fad.
3885360	3892360	And now it's hopping aboard this one. His book is about him hot on the trail of this kid who's disappeared while playing D&D.
3892360	3902360	So he goes and climbs trees and spies on Hobbit clubs like he like the Tolkien society meets in the woods and he climbs a tree and eavesdrops on them.
3902360	3912360	He goes and he just he goes and he goes into a hobby store and pays the clerk 50 bucks on the slides and says, hey, can you get me a game of Dungeons and Dragons?
3912360	3921360	And he plays in a hotel room, Dungeons and Dragons, and characterizes as like he loses his consciousness and he wakes up in the hotel rooms empty.
3921360	3930360	Like he's just writing all this stuff. And then the kid comes back after a couple of days and says, no, I figured out I was gay and I loved heroin.
3930360	3937360	I'm a genius. I got bored. Oh, D&D. Yeah, I played that too. Jesus Christ.
3938360	3942360	The book literally ends with the kid calling the detective and going, are you looking for me?
3944360	3948360	I still wrote the book. The story must be told.
3948360	3954360	And part of it was the note he left didn't match his handwriting. And that was always a big like missing puzzle piece.
3954360	3959360	So he meets the kid in the diner and goes like, but what about the note? And he's like, oh, yeah, let me show you. And he wrote it with his left hand.
3962360	3965360	Why did you do that? Because I thought it would fuck with people.
3966360	3972360	Because I wrote a book. I'm a gay heroin addict genius. Yeah, I'm bored. I'm bored.
3973360	3979360	This society is run by people like you. Your book needed an ending. I'm trying to help. Yeah, you're welcome.
3980360	3987360	You're welcome on behalf of everyone in the Manson family. You're welcome on behalf of every teenager whose parents got scared that they were into something bad.
3987360	3993360	You're welcome all of you fucking dumb assholes. I got bored. I'm smart.
3993360	4002360	It's hard to be smart. I wonder what heroin is like. It seems great. I bet it's the best. It's got to be fucking wonderful.
4002360	4009360	It's got to be better than sex, which is currently the best thing. Well, it's got to be better than a can of Pringles because I had one of those.
4009360	4018360	So people call me Pringles, but I never really found out why. I don't really have a pretty. I've seen it all day.
4018360	4027360	Sometimes Pringles just fucking comes into my mind. Also, I was singing Chicken Noodle Dick all day. Chicken Noodle Dick, I think is a good song.
4027360	4035360	And people don't really recognize how good that song is. It's a good song. Some of the bonus footage is you can actually see us coming up with Chicken Noodle Dick on the bus.
4035360	4045360	That was my one note with the movie is that we didn't see the origin of Chicken Noodle Dick. Also, did they show you trying everything in the bus with aspirin dick?
4046360	4057360	You put peanut butter on my dick and then not peanut butter on my dick. That sounded weird. Not with like a knife. A jar of peanut butter.
4057360	4068360	I put it on my hand. I brought a conquer spaniel in a flashlight and a bottle of aspirin. I don't think. Yeah, whatever.
4068360	4078360	It's a bonus footage. You can check it out. Let's thank Seek for coming by. Thank you. Is there anything to plug Seek?
4078360	4087360	Not really. How about the Harman Town Prince I made? I'll be here Wednesday selling them and Monomyth here at the store at Meltdown Wednesday night.
4087360	4110360	All right. Thank you, Seek. Can I talk about the Rob Schwab thing? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's time for our society section. So Rob Schwab continues his fucking campaign of terror on Twitter.
4111360	4137360	Explain it for people that don't know. Okay. So this is what it is. This is what it is. For instance, someone will tweet something and he will ask them the most up. So like yesterday or a couple of days ago, Nathan Fielder, who's very funny, Rachel, Nathan for you tweeted a link and said, this is a sketch from my show. And he responded, is there a link? So that's the level of humor we're dealing with. But it's relentless.
4137360	4153360	He's committed to being an obtuse weirdo. So like today, Steve Agee tweeted, who wants a Panasonic DVX100B? And Rob Schwab responded, how many B is it?
4153360	4182360	It's called shrobbing. And kids around the world are doing it. And kids love it. They call it shrobbing. This is another one. So I did a really stupid joke. But this is not what the story is about. I just found this just crawling to the story. I made a stupid joke. It was late night. And I just said, I just combined two comedians.
4182360	4203360	Like Zach Elphinakis and Jack Black. And I just I said, like, my favorite mashup comedian is Zach Black or something stupid. It's not a funny thing. Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack Black. Rob Schwab responds, what are some others? I like this.
4204360	4220360	This is what this that's that's an opportunity for a great tweet premise. There's so much look at this. I want 900 of these. I like Jonah Robin Williams, Bill Cosby top, Bobcat DeGeneres.
4221360	4233360	These are your shrubs. These are shrubs. Bobcat DeGeneres. They don't make sense. He's just doing random shit. Red Fox Hicks. And then he starts hashtagging at Kamel's bed.
4236360	4243360	This is my favorite one. Cedric the cherry sign fell. Cedric the cherry sign fell.
4243360	4265360	He's the Andy Warhol of tweets. He really is drawing a drawing a picture of a soup can. So I tweeted I started Oh, you should I started rewatching the X files and I do a podcast called the X files files on the Feral Network.
4265360	4285360	Listen to it. So I'm having like certain people connected with the show tweeting at me every now and then nobody big but like, you know, periphery. So this guy who writes the new X files comic book tweeted at me. He was like, hey, have you read it? His name is Joe Harris. I was like, no, I haven't. I've heard amazing things. Rob Schwab responds to me, him and the publisher.
4286360	4310360	Wait, does that mean he's following all of you to or I don't know. Okay, I bet. No, it's just he's checking your checking and like, he's harassing him. Yeah, yeah, of course campaign of terror. He loves he does it all. So he's, I said he pushed the work in is what he really does. I mean, if you look at his timeline, it's so much work goes into it. So many disparate targets like he's going after everybody has office hours for this.
4311360	4319360	So I responded, no, I haven't read it sounds awesome. Rob Schwab responds to everybody. I heard a cow once.
4323360	4325360	So I got really angry.
4326360	4336360	Is Rob having a stroke? Is he is he all right? We should I heard it's awesome. I heard a cow once. Okay, great. I can't wait for your office hours to be over.
4337360	4353360	So I got really angry. And I just tweeted, I said, if this tweet gets 200 retweets, I'll block Rob Schwab out here. And then he got so many. And then obviously, I didn't block him. He's like, it's not 200. It's 277. So you still have to be friends with me.
4353360	4377360	So then this happened. The next thing this is the one I wanted to tell you guys, this is when Dan and I, and then so this is how you got into it. You tweeted that Rick and Morty was coming out on high on Blu Ray. Yes. And he responded on what format? Fair question.
4378360	4395360	So this is what happened. So then I tweeted, Oh, you tweeted. No, I tweeted something stupid. I said, it doesn't matter. It's about Captain America and how he's black and someday won't matter. It's not a funny tweet. It's one of my, you know, social justice tweets.
4396360	4398360	That's part of my brand.
4398360	4413360	I said something about that. Then Dan Hart, you said, look, whites have a talent for noticing race. We can use it to advance or destroy society. But if we drop it, then we're out of work. Rob Schwab. Very funny. Very funny. Self deprecating white loathing tweet.
4414360	4425360	It's great. And it's me and you talking. Yes. It's two intellectuals. We're kind of a daily show level social commentary. A lot going on. Rob Schwab jumps in with, I can drop.
4426360	4453360	This is his dream, by the way, is you recounting all this. This is this is all this is where all the laughter he's he's he's going to be listening to this. And it's like, I think I think because because he is like he is an abstract just kind of in general, he I think he has created a movement here. I think that this is an art. He's going through some kind of metamorphosis. He was at Comic Con. I came up with this.
4453360	4469360	He was at Comic Con. I came to the Starburns booth and he was sitting there with all these old Scud comics just to sell them and sign them. And he kept making these comments as people would come up and they would go, I really like community. I'm so glad you got six seasons. And then Rob would just go like, ha ha. Yeah, look.
4469360	4485360	He just like he was just like chiming in with like, and then I was like, man, does anybody have a napkin? Because I was eating a pretzel with mustard on it. And he and he handed me a copy of Scud number one.
4486360	4501360	I was like, here you go. I was like, what's what's going on? He's like doing this bit where he's like, you know what? He's achieving transcendence like that Johnny Depp movie. He's he's crossing over. He's crossing over. He came there with a box of comic books.
4501360	4514360	Like, Rob doesn't need money. Like, Rob, I mean, everybody needs money. But Rob's not like, Rob didn't think he was gonna sit at that table with the comic books. And it was like he was doing a character. Like, he's like, we're performance artists now.
4514360	4533360	Like, yeah. So he responded with Rob shrub just texted me. Just now. He's fucking here. Is he here? Is he in the he's inside the building? He texted me? What's my name on Twitter? What does that even mean?
4534360	4549360	It's the dumbest question of all. He chopped himself. This is like the beginning of scream. This is horrifying. Somebody must be texting him.
4549360	4575360	I approve of his humor 100%. This is I always enjoy it. I never it's always perfect. But then he used to get mad at me for doing what he called repeat rooting, where I would do a bit over and over again, like, Rob, nice parking. And I would keep doing a bit like he's now just doing repeat. He does repeat rooting. So he responded with I can draw and Dan responded with hashtag. So could Hitler.
4580360	4593360	Which by the way, is my favorite hashtag. Yeah, it trended in Argentina. Well, that was just because of all the World Cup tweets. Like, boy, these guys can really score a goal.
4594360	4608360	So, so you said that and we were both like smarting from just a couple days of just intense stuff. So then I said the trains aren't running on time on shops watch though. So in a way, Hitler was better than shop.
4609360	4618360	You said, well, for one thing, when Goebbels posted propaganda, Hitler didn't write what country is this promoting underneath it.
4620360	4627360	And then I said, I said, and when Hitler heard the phrase final solution, he wasn't like, how many solutions will there be after this one?
4627360	4645360	And then the next thing he did, he didn't respond to any of those. And that's where the fucking Bill Cosby top red fox six thing happened. And I was like, all right, you went. I am never.
4645360	4655360	Is there a way that we can you can't subvert what he's doing? Because the whole thing is subversion. He comes underneath you. Is there a way that this audience right here that we can attack Rob Schwab on Twitter and do something?
4655360	4666360	People are already like when he does these things, people like have countered by posting things similarly to his tweets or to his comments. Yeah, he can't post a picture of his dog without there being one hundred and fifty.
4666360	4679360	What kind of animal is this? It's amazing. I guess I guess the way to do it is to is to the way to subvert him is to co-opt it and make it bigger than him.
4680360	4687360	Well, that's we should go. We should post it. We should call someone else, though, credit it with like someone else. Like we call it coup mailing.
4688360	4700360	And then just so we say that you create. Yeah, we all go after like like Cameron Diaz. We all say that it's it's your bit. Well, we should post it. Where should we post it? I think we were.
4701360	4718360	This is a sad family. Adam Bober just got excited and the crowd got very bummed out about it. We should make a huge banner that says, hey, Rob Schwab, where do you live and put it like outside his house?
4719360	4733360	How about this? Every time you just hashtag his phone number. Oh, yeah, that's it. His home phone, his cell phone. That's not it. That's not. I mean, the final solution.
4734360	4747360	He's a monster and there is no way to defeat him. He's a bad person, but he's created an art movement and that's that's he's like a situation spread like I feel like I feel like it's spread by this point.
4748360	4754360	It's like I feel like there's a kid somewhere doing that underneath a high school friend's Instagram, like without any connection to us at all.
4754360	4773360	Like people are just going like, there's more. He's what he's doing. But he's live texting you right now. No, no, no. This is what I found. He said two days ago, I'll be signing selling. I'll be signing slash selling rare scud merch and original art at the Starburns booth. Blah, blah, blah.
4773360	4791360	Not 3917 Saturday at 11 a.m. Hashtag SDCC 2014 hashtag scud TDA. Someone said, will you be at the booth there today at all? Rob shrub and Rob responded, I'll be signing slash selling rare scud merch and original art.
4792360	4809360	And he didn't get it. He didn't get the joke. No, I said that I didn't bury the lead. No, multiple people have responded with that exact thing. And he has copied and pasted the same thing in every response. He says the same thing.
4810360	4814360	The hunters become hunted, but then he's become the hunter again.
4814360	4819360	I think he's having a nervous breakdown.
4819360	4838360	But he Instagrammed a picture of himself heading home from the con and said, like, I'm leaving the convention because I'm having such because it was so much fun or something. It was kind of a sad emo kind of picture of him. And I don't know how to seriously to take that. Did he have a good time? I don't know. Does he does he love does he love this new role?
4839360	4856360	I don't know. I think he just misses Kate. I think Kate's doing so. He said I'm leaving early because I miss my wife and dog. He's he's worthless without Kate and the dog. If you see him out alone, he cannot wait to get back to that little. Oh, yeah. He doesn't like to be like out and about really. He he.
4856360	4859360	Why do you leave early?
4860360	4863360	I'm going to text him.
4863360	4865360	That might be the first.
4865360	4867360	Chris.
4867360	4869360	Yeah.
4869360	4885360	All right. I want to bring up a we want to bring up a new new person, a new person. Should we slant female? I say I say definitely because we've had a testosterone. There's too many boys on stage.
4885360	4906360	We need somebody to play Aaron McGathey's character in D&D. Do we have any anybody vaguely girly that wants to do it? Oh, I got a hand over here. All right.
4906360	4910360	Not that I see gender.
4910360	4922360	What is your name? Stephanie. Hello, Stephanie. Welcome to the stage. Stephanie. Stephanie. Sorry, Stephanie. You didn't go to the convention. I did not know work. No, it's just kind of expensive.
4922360	4936360	Yeah, they get so hard to get to sell out immediately and a fucking glass of water over this shit. Shit. I'm sorry. I'm so profane all of a sudden. Shit. Shit. Excuse me. Fuck. Fuck. We have one girl on stage.
4936360	4951360	Fuck, fuck, fuck. Poison Ivy, fucking grab your ass. The the it's what was the example? Well, your buffet. Twenty six dollars for a hotel buffet. Twenty six dollars. You couldn't get water for like under three dollars.
4951360	4965360	I hate San Diego. San Diego's a bad place. Oh, it was more hotels than anything else, really. And hotels are always bad. I thought San Diego was lovely. Never been to Balboa Park. Yeah, but not the downtown in San Diego is what I have a problem with.
4965360	4992360	It's really walkable. You can't get up. It's not so walkable. Is it walkable? It is. It's walkable. It's so fucking contagious. Stephanie, where are you from? I live in L.A. Are you born and raised here? No, I am from a small town in the desert. Which desert? Mojave? Mojave, yes. Ridgecrest, California. Anybody? Nope.
4993360	5021360	It seems like you're being pursued by a gang or something. You can't get too many details. No one's from there. Is that out in the desert? No, no, no. Is it? There's a place with a very similar name to that. That's definitely out in the desert. She just said it from the Mojave Desert. Oh, sorry, guys. My friend moved out there. He was my best friend. Now we're all on shrob alert right now. I was busting out character sheets, guys. Sorry.
5021360	5049360	Stephanie, what were you doing? I was busting out character sheets, you guys. God, no. Don't let it proliferate. Stephanie, you fled the desert. Now you live in Los Angeles? Yes. And what do you do out here? I'm a web designer. Oh, really? Yes. Fantastic. What websites have you worked on? I used to be a web designer. Oh, nothing good right now. That's what I did. I used to design it. Yeah, it's tough. How do you know when you're finished?
5051360	5080360	You're never done. Did you go to school for that? I went to school for art. So I have a fine arts degree. Well, so you're like, your web pages look pretty, you're more, less programming more like vibe. I mean, vibe and brand is important. But I also like the efficiency of the website. Right. How's it work? Is it? I want to be more of a product designer, but right now I'm just kind of doing the visual design. So product designer.
5080360	5109360	Product as in like the entire website, the functionality. Okay, you know, really taking into account of users. Yeah, you're just starting though. Yeah, I'm kind of starting. Do you believe in God? No. Well, then nobody can help you. Because, you know, if God wanted us to be on the web, he would have put mouse cords in our hands. He would have had dot com as a button on the keyboard. Yeah, yeah.
5109360	5138360	Gotta keep typing that shit out all the time. Fuck you, Adam. Wait, okay. No, that's fine. You do what? Control. Oh, is that a control? Is that a control? We're all strong. Is that Mac or PC? Control.com? That's not true. For real. Mac or PC. Of course, use a PC. Well, then.
5138360	5167360	You're a bad person. Yeah, control. Oh, control enter. I'm sorry. Control. Oh, probably open. Open. I think I'll never learn a little hot key things that you can do. Like I think I watched you type Dan one time on the computer. You were typing stuff and you had all these little special commands and you're making the cursor just duck and dive all over the thing. It was very exciting. I learned everything I know from watching swordfish.
5169360	5183360	Is that why you have two computers and you take your shirt off all the time? Yeah, it doesn't look as cool, but I always say there's actually a what's the website everyone should experience is it's pretty fun. You guys probably are knew knew knew about it from years ago. It's called a hacker.
5183360	5212360	Hacker. Hacker. I don't know. Hacker. Hacker. Hacker. Hacker. Hacker. Google around about it. It's a it's just a website that where you it waits for keystrokes and then it just generates. Oh, so you can just sit there and type on your keyboard and it looks like you're a super hacker. It's really cool. Does it have like, like cubes aligning? That's what we thought. No, no, no. It's just code. It's just code. That's how it is on Silicon Valley. We just type random shit in there.
5214360	5226360	It's really fun. Like it's it's it's like it's like going to a western saloon set and breaking a bottle over your head. Like it's like it's just magical thing that you get to do. It's pretty cool. Like I did it for like 20 minutes.
5228360	5240360	But you can do it for real. I'm not a hacker. No, but you can tell you program. You do HTML. I do HTML. Yeah, you do PHP a little bit JavaScript. Do you use smarty templates? No.
5243360	5252360	I haven't designed a web page since 1999. Is that a real thing? Smarty templates were awesome back in my day. Do you use it? Do you use MS Print Shop?
5254360	5256360	Do you use Mario Paint?
5258360	5271360	All right, Spencer, distribute our character sheets if you would. All right. I would. So, Stephanie, you're going to play the role of Mulray and Sedana. Are you familiar with that? A little bit. A little bit. Now, I did not listen to the last episode. So what happened as Spencer?
5272360	5286360	I haven't listened to it. We wisely did a side side mission because we had Duncan up here. So all he wanted to do is cut off Camille's nipples. What is Duncan wanted to assassinate Camille's character so much? His is a different culture.
5287360	5297360	He cut my nipples? I have some theories. We did like a side. It was like a what if Marvel comic. Is that canon? Are my nipples still there? Who knows?
5300360	5313360	It felt like a one off. We were playing ourselves and we just ran out into traffic and we were flipping cars over. Spencer, not metagaming or side borrowing, but my cactus card from the cactus bunch. We never found out about it, right?
5313360	5342360	Did I ever find out about it? You found out. What? It's a card. It's a card. What does it entitle me to? Who knows? Yeah, I guess you didn't find it out. I have a strange painted stick. You sure do, man. Okay. Stephanie, are you ready to join us on what threatens to be the greatest D&D in podcast history? Sure. All right. Don't worry about that sheet so much. It's like a jumping off point.
5344360	5354360	I'll just drink a lot and then just ignore completely. That's a, she's drinking water. I'm drinking water. I'm also only 18. I can't even drink. That's a lie. That's a lie.
5357360	5368360	You're, you're, you're 18. No, I'm 25. God damn it. That was really bad joke. All right. We're all going to jail. Spencer, take us away.
5369360	5384360	Last time on Harmon town, our heroes were shitting in the purple caverns. After a wild goose chase by Tylenol with Cody, they found and destroyed three magical gem creatures, then went through a crack.
5385360	5396360	It was in that crack that the gang encountered a black dragon. And after great discussion and harassment, our heroes woke the dragon, but luckily ran away before it could attack.
5397360	5412360	Leaving the cave and blinking in the sunlight, Sharpie saw a shape on the horizon. A great black airship. It was one of Admiral Darkstar's vessels. The airship crashed into the canyon walls, ejecting flaming goblins across the wreckage site.
5412360	5427360	And after slaughtering two of the flaming passengers, Sharpie bagged the last one in his bag of holding. Examining the flaming vessel for Luke, Quark discovered a crystalline disc and realizing its nature, used the unit to power on the robot baby.
5428360	5440360	But would this robot be peace loving or built for war? Could our heroes navigate their way out of the purple canyons? Our bags of holding fireproof. Where was Tylenol with Cody?
5440360	5446360	Find out on this next episode of an all new Harmontown time episode.
5471360	5489360	As you look, you feel arcane energies coalescing in the air around you. And as your threads of light seem to be streaming from the ground and air converging upon the baby, it activates its eyes glow bright blue and all the energy absorbs inside of its metal shell with a twinkle.
5489360	5499360	It gets up onto its feet and looks around and it's like, unit active, diagnostic complete, logic core, damaged.
5499360	5522360	Hello. Swipe to unlock. I swiped the baby. Hello. You guys aren't gnomes. I'm a gnome. You guys are a gnome. But you guys aren't. I'm confused. You're just a baby. What's your name, little fella?
5522360	5543360	Logic damaged. That's a strange name. What? What's your name? Logic damaged. We'll have to give him a name. His name is logic damaged. Logic damaged. What? Your name is logic damaged. Oh, my name is logic damaged.
5543360	5569360	What is your prime directive? Prime directive. My prime directive. Unlock the secret gate of logic damaged. Resting place of logic damaged. What are you guys doing? That's a good question. I feel like that's important information.
5569360	5588360	We're just kind of like, we kind of roam from town to town, generally kill people, forget to loot them. We're kind of vagabonds. We set things on fire mostly. I don't really, I guess that's fine. We stole you. Oh, these are all normal things. Yeah, totally normal. Very admirable traits.
5588360	5615360	Hey, can I call you Logi? Whatever you want. Listen, Logi, how do we restore your logic, the part of the syntax, the code that doesn't compute? I don't know. I don't know how I'm put together. Well, can we talk about the location that you're supposed to go to to find the resting place of the thing that you don't remember? I don't know where it is or what it is.
5615360	5637360	Who has who has logic arcana? What of us? Because he's spoken like arcane logic or arcane knowledge. Arcane energy is coming off of it is knowledge knowledge of arcana. So that'll teach you of its magical nature. Perhaps I don't have it. I have a sticky. This is robot plans. Yeah, robot.
5638360	5666360	Can we look at the robot plans? Or is that plans we make? Is there some code we can hack? You look at it. You see some various words, but you can't read it, I guess, because it's there. Maybe a gnomish. I take the robot plans and read it. All right. Most. You can't read a lot of these words too, because they're weird jargon, but a couple places you see a couple like areas by it's a by the forehead that say logic. Those are the words you can make out on on the baby's forehead on.
5666360	5695360	The baby's forehead on the plans. Oh, it's like a drawing of the baby. Yeah, the robot baby plans. I examine the baby's forehead. It looks normal, I guess. I do. I do have knowledge of arcana, like 13 skill bonus. I mean, that doesn't we don't care. Do we? Well, it mostly is about magic. So if you're questioning like, oh, wow, what kind of magic animated this guy? Yeah, I mean, any insight.
5696360	5722360	There. What's it plus 13? Yeah. You determine that it's, you know, a golem. It's not any other type of automata. It's definitely a golem, which means it's infused with some sort of living soul. And a Jewish thing. Yeah, actually, I mean, technically speeding. Yeah, Jewish. So there's like a Jewish baby. It's like a, it's like a Jewish muppet. We should probably circumcise it, right?
5723360	5733360	It doesn't, we've been over this. It doesn't have a penis. Oh, so somebody already fucked that up. Is it a lady?
5734360	5738360	It doesn't seem to have a gender, really.
5739360	5756360	Your location that you're supposed to go to, were you supposed to go to it with others? I don't know. Was it on this plane of reality? Yep. So it's a geographic location. Yep. But you don't know where it is.
5757360	5769360	Yep. Would you, would you, would you know if you got closer to it? I don't really know. Probably. Maybe. I don't know. Maybe not. Have you?
5770360	5782360	Well, are you, are you programmed with a map that tells you where to go or are you programmed with a sensor that like, like makes you sense when you get closer to this place? I don't think either of those things, really.
5783360	5791360	Have you been awake before or is this your first time awake? No, I have not, sir. Hey, I like this guy.
5794360	5808360	How many of you are there? I don't know. I'm of me. Are you programmed for battle? I don't, what? No, what? Can you hurt people? Maybe. How would you do that?
5809360	5834360	We should test its self-defense by trying to kick it and see what it does. So, okay. Well, what do you want to do? I'm not doing that. Can I try it? I'm a gnome. I'm not kicking this baby. I'm going to try and kick the baby just to see, just to see if it's a fighting baby. I think this is a bad idea. Maybe it's a fighting baby and this is how we find out. Okay. All right.
5834360	5863360	Hey, Logi. And then I kick you. What's your strength here? I don't kick at full strength. Okay. 13 plus one. All right. Well, you kick it and it just falls over. Jesus Christ. Oh my God. Jesus. I scoop it up in my arms and start crying. Oh my God.
5864360	5892360	It's a fighting baby. Jesus. Not a battle baby. This is normal, right? Yep. This is how people behind us, please forget about this. It's normal. Logi, this is not normal. I take it down to a river and then there's all kinds of flashbacks of what my dad did to me and I'm freaking the fuck out and I'm just like crying and like rocking back and forth. It's called stimming, what I'm doing. What about this, this Admiral Darkstar vessel that crashed into the caverns? It's on fire.
5892360	5920360	All the goblins came out of that and we killed a couple? Yeah. Well, Tylenol with Cody, he stomped on one and he killed the other one. And we have one in the bag of holding. Yeah. And it's on fire? What? He was on fire when we put him in there. The goblin was on fire, yeah. Somebody take this baby. I give it to a court. Can I have the baby? I'm going to give it to the gnome. No, you keep kicking the baby. I just kicked the baby once. You kick one baby. Mulrain, wait. Mulrain, go ahead.
5921360	5949360	The baby because I'm a woman. So it's my duty. Is that sexist? If I give it to him, it's racist. What is it if he give it to me? A fucking practical danger. An actual measured scientifically proven danger. Let's give it to Mulrain. I'll hold it for right now. Mulrain holds the baby. Alright, I give it to Mulrain and I'm going to pull this goblin out of the bag of holding. Alright. It's time to get enhanced about our interrogation. Okay.
5949360	5978360	Oh, Jack Bauer business. Oh, poured some water. Has the lamp been invented yet? Yeah, yeah. Wait, which kind of lamp? One with a dimmer switch? No. I mean, we have enough weapons, enhanced interrogation. It's not going to be a problem. Alright. Alright. So as you pull them out, your hand, it burns.
5979360	5983360	You know, because the goblins on fire.
5986360	5996360	Is it still on fire? Yeah. Yeah. You take shrapnel? No, I just, my character saw you reaching. I take my water skin and douse the goblin.
5996360	6023360	Sharpie takes five fire damage and you smell the smells of burning wood and fibrous items coming from inside the bag of holding. Ah, fuck. What does that mean? I put my head and hand into the bag of holding. No, no. I got to put out the fire. Okay. Take my water skin. Hey, I have a weird theory. Maybe it's a fire putting out baby. Let's toss it in.
6023360	6050360	Give you a baby to the gnome now. You just lost your baby privileges. I take the baby and protect the baby. He could be a fireman baby. He's a robot baby. And we tried to kick it and we succeeded. Listen, I feel terrible about it. These are the imprinting moments of a robot baby's life.
6050360	6078360	It's learning. It doesn't know its name. Now its name is Robert Logia. It's not Robert Logia. So, could we tell him that he fights fires? Well, not if he's not good at it. I take the baby. I said, baby, we got a, we got a, we got a fire situation. Do you know? Oh, great. No, bad. That's bad. You just said, you earlier said that that was completely normal to do to towns and cities and other stuff. Oh, no. Yeah, look. Oh, no.
6078360	6107360	What are we doing to this baby's mind? This is like three men and a baby. Do you have any firefighting skills, baby? How do you fight the fire? I'm asking you. Clearly doesn't. Okay. Sharpie, you're going to put your, you're going to look into the bag. I'm going into the bag with my, and I'm going to cast a ray of frost on any existing fire. All right. You put out any existing fire and the rest of the smoke puts, you know, comes out, but.
6108360	6136360	Ray of frost. Some of your. Used to be popular. Some of your items. Isn't that like a, it's kind of a low level spell, but that turned out pretty good. Yeah, but it was a job done. What got lost? Some of your items are damaged. Which, which ones? I don't know. Can I see your sheet? Don't give it to him. Well, I, I already crossed everything off, I think. Oh, so, so everything that was in the bag of holding caught fire and now it's all bullshit. I put a, I put a burning goblin in our bag of holding. Was the goblin alive?
6136360	6164360	I wasn't, I don't remember. It happens. Everything flammable was not in the bag of holding. It was in a backpack. Okay. Good. So there's a, there's maybe some burning happening in a, in the inside of the bag. That's, you know, maybe there's some bag leaks. Great. I don't think you can see inside the bag because it's all dark. Get that goblin out Sharpie. He's already out. He's out, but he's still on fire. Right? Yep. He's still on fire. It's like magic fire. He's like a trick birthday candle. It's like magic fire. Yeah.
6166360	6195360	Oh, he's a flaming goblin. Like by trade, he's not just on fire by accident. I mean, whether or not you decide that he's a flaming goblin by birth or by cultural choice is very controversial. So tread lightly. This is what he was born this way. That makes it better for you. Oh, yeah. Okay. What do you want to look at it as like a perverse lifestyle?
6197360	6214360	I thought we were talking about a different parallel and now I realize it's gay people. Yeah. What did you think I was doing? Black people. Really? I prefer to think black people were born in black. I do.
6215360	6226360	I also would like, but the traits, the specific traits. Anyway, this is a, we're getting into a real bag of holding over here.
6227360	6240360	I asked the goblin, what was it going on in the Admiral Darkstar's ship? Oh, what? I talk like this too.
6242360	6255360	Hello goblin. Hey. I hold my sword in a threatening manner towards his neck and I go, what's your story, cocksucker? You didn't choose to be a cocksucker.
6256360	6278360	There's nothing wrong with that. I've been watching a lot of dead wood. Everything's going to be a cocksucker. My name is Justin. Justin. Justin, state your purpose, Justin. I'm a member of the Buzzface Raiders. The Buzzface Raiders? Yeah.
6279360	6303360	We're a gang of tough, loving goblins. Tough, loving? We love tough. Well, you're going to love a sword in your stomach. If you don't tell me what Admiral Darkstar is up to right now. I don't know who that is. What you're talking about. Didn't you just come off a vessel from Admiral Darkstar? I came off of the flaming ship. It wasn't flaming earlier.
6303360	6332360	The ship bore his mark, quote unquote, cocksucker. Our brethren liberated the vessel for ourselves. Interesting. But we couldn't drive it. Oh, so you didn't get shot down. You guys are just bad at flying vessels. We're not terrible. Looks like you were terrible. I think that maybe there just weren't enough of us. Where did you get the vessel from?
6332360	6361360	We stole it from the air city. If there wasn't enough of you, can we all hop on and drive it? Oh, it's all wrecked up, I think. I can't fix it. I'm a pirate. Do you think the baby could fix it? Maybe it's a ship fixing baby. That's the purpose of this baby. I put the baby down on the ground and I go, baby, I grabbed the baby. No, you're not a fit parent. I want to show you guys that I'm a good parent. I'm not going to do anything bad to you.
6362360	6391360	I did the baby. I'm sorry. I kicked the baby and I'm not. This is me showing. I love the baby. Okay. And I'm going to be good to the baby. I give you one more chance with this baby. Oh, I'm good with the baby. All right. So I have the baby. Right. Yeah. All right. I want to ask the goblin one question. All right. Where did you get the disc that activated this baby? That was on the ship. Oh, where did you get the ship? We stole it from the air city.
6391360	6421360	Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shrub you. What? How can we get to the air city? You'd have to fly there. All right. That makes sense. How damaged is the ship? Is it totally unfliable now or is it? It's all Hindenburg. Too soon. Too late, I think. Too late. Don't kill me. I'm on fire. Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you?
6421360	6451360	Do you want us to put you out? Are you comfortable being on fire? If I recall correctly, you tried that multiple times. So you're good. I'm on fire, but I can't do anything about it. Are you always on fire? This is. I was not always on fire. We should. Is there more? Do you have no more ray of frost? I, I have my armlet of winter. My armulets. And I go, I'm a little winter. I put this goblin out cold air streams towards him.
6451360	6481360	And it doesn't put him out. Jesus Christ. I mean, it's like, he's fire. He seems okay. Hey, uh, you know, people go through changes and that's part of it. Yep. Is this, do you think that this fire is not going out because of the propulsion system of your stolen Zeppelin? No, I don't think so. We got hit by lightning. Flaming lightning. Oh, it's like a magic fire. You're like cursed or something.
6481360	6511360	Sure. It's like a fire curse. I take the baby and go examine the record. No, I don't give you the baby. I hold on to the baby. Ask me if you want the baby. Ask me if you want the baby. Christopher, would you accompany me while holding the baby and go look at the wreckage of the ship? Because it seems to be that maybe there's, this baby has some sort of connection to it. I would love to. Okay. Wasn't that easy? You're really on edge right now. I just, I feel bad about.
6511360	6541360	I feel bad about kicking. We probably want to get to this air city, right? Let's go to look at the thing. I don't know. Do you want to just go everywhere that gets mentioned in a movie? Yeah. Yes. Yes, I do. And here's why Sharpie. Here's why I do want to go everywhere. Because we've, we've been to a lot of places. We were, we were in an Infini fish. We have been to the like nether worlds, the shadow planes. We've been all over the place. And what do we have?
6541360	6571360	We have the show for it. Nothing, right? I don't want to be wandering the earth or the planes and the realms for the rest of my life. I want to, I'd like to have a little money. I'd like to, I'd like to, you know, maybe open a shop one day that sells cigarettes and just be a happy gnome. But right now we're not getting anything done. I feel like now we're hitting our stride. And I feel like right now what we do is we follow our nose and we go, we say yes to the universe right now. And we loot every fucking person.
6571360	6601360	Wait, you want to go to the air city to rob it? What? Yes. Yes. Yes. That's exactly what I'm saying. Because look, are we good or are we bad? We've killed a lot of people for no reason. Hey, hey. You kick baby. Shut up. I'm saying when we eat our muffs, baby. Now you could talk about the shit we've done. I know. Now you're protecting the baby. Yeah, it's a baby. Okay. I'm just saying, um, I think we have a, a moral compass right
6601360	6631360	now that we're pretty good about knowing good from evil. But I do say that what we've, what we've gained over these travels is an ability to ascertain and use that sword to cut through the bullshit of morality, of, of, of, of, of, of good and evil. And I think it's time to start making that money. I feel exactly the opposite way. I mean, I, I feel like we have been directionless in all of our adventures. Well, maybe we should just part company then. Like maybe like, what are we doing?
6631360	6661360	I think. Should we all just say fuck it? I mean, I mean, okay. How about this? Let's all go home. Where's your home? I can't remember. Yeah. I don't even, I don't, I can't remember my phone number where I live. I don't know what the fuck. I don't know how to, like taxi. There's no taxi. We can't go anywhere. I do need to get back home to my father. Yep. Back at the, the butts a lot. Where is that? Where is the butts a lot tribe? How do we get there? Butts alosia. How do we get to butts alosia? Butts expanse. Where?
6661360	6691360	Where's the butts expanse from here? Well, I mean, you took some portals. You don't know exactly your geographic location. I'm saying that we're, we're adrift right now. Yeah. But you know what? Now we have a new anchor. We have a baby. We don't know what's going on and we don't know where we are. But we want to give this baby the best life possible. I agree with you. I agree. We've done a lot of wrong, but now we do right. Christopher, Christopher, I agree with you, but we have to give this baby a life. What sort of life are we going to give them? We're going to do the right thing. No more looting. No more killing.
6691360	6721360	Are you saying that we're not, if we get confronted by bad guys, we're not going to kill them? Listen, it's self defense. Sure. But we're not going to set the red shops on fire because we don't like their prices. I'm not saying, I'm not saying that we're murderers. We go out wantingly killing people. I'm saying that when the crisis presents itself and we have to use violence. We take care of ours. And we loot the motherfuckers. I don't like the L word. Here's what I would say.
6721360	6751360	When the ship got put into the baby, came from the ship, the ship came from the city, the disc has the information on it. The information's damaged. The disc has something to do with some waking place or resting place in some place of the treasure of the thing. The baby's programmed to go... We follow that instinct. We go to the city. We find out who made the disc. It's not just us saying yes, everything is mentioned we go do. I'm saying that by this point, we have to follow our noses. We've just got to stop robbing and raping it.
6751360	6781360	We've never raped... No, I've raped. Old habits die hard. I might rape anything that comes and comes by. Usually an animal of some sort. Usually a furry creature. Okay, could you just give us like five before you can go do it so we can not have the baby see you. Fucking a deer or whatever. I say, because we have a baby with us, I'm going to be on my best behavior. But we do have to go find Sky City. Okay. Alright, we go to the Air City to find out where the disc got made.
6781360	6811360	We can find out, let this baby fulfill its destiny and make us rich. Yes. How are we going to Air City? How? We go to Ground Town, which has got to have a way to get to Air City. Otherwise, how would they get there? Yeah, you got to take a step back to move two steps forward. Is there a place called Ground Town? Who are you asking, I guess? Is there a place? I asked the goblin. When you go get
6811360	6841360	to Air City, where do you go first? How did you get there? We flew there. Yeah. Where do you get the shit that you fly there? Arrow Hawks? Arrow Hawks? You fish them out of the sky. Hmm. What are they? They're all around us. What are they? They're Hawks. Arrow Hawks. I look up. I examine the sky for Arrow Hawks. You don't see any shit. Avenger.
6841360	6870320	What? See, that's I think how Animorphs noted Falcon Cries. Avenger, look for Arrow Hawks. See you. It does. It looks around. It doesn't it doesn't see any. Are they around in this area? Or did they habitate a different part of the world? Where I'm from? They're all around. Where are you from? The hills. Okay, well, how far are the hills? Well, we flew there. I don't I don't know.
6871360	6901320	Feels like we need to go to the hills to get an arrow Hawk to fly to Earth. Let's let's let's run to the hills. Are those the do we see hills? You do. Oh, right. We had those ones, though. Not those that does. Okay, what do you say? He said not those the hills where you can see air not the hills. He means where the goblin. Do you know how to find an arrow Hawk? Oh, you know, you find me an arrow Hawk nest. Where would you find an arrow Hawk nest?
6901360	6930920	The tops of the hills lead us there. I don't know. We flew here. It's different down here. I can't see where wet. I want to kill myself. I'm really tired. Goblins have adventure adventure. Can't accomplish this. Avenger can't find around. He's not seen anything. They're not native to these. Airships go fast and far, man. Shit. Maybe they're on all hills. So maybe these hills will have arrow Hawks on them.
6932360	6944360	I mean, I'm not saying it's amazing logic. Anybody in the crowd have any ideas? I don't think he can fly.
6945360	6964360	Tylenol with codeines there, by the way, guys. Oh, hello. I have been hither and yon and yon and hither. I was just hanging out with the jabber walk on Emerald Hills.
6964360	6992360	Tylenol. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We've been neglecting you right now. Do you know how to find an arrow Hawk? Oh, yes. Yes. I know many arrow Hawks in my travels. Take us to one. You know, I will. And now away. He grasps his Emerald of shadow worlding and phases out of existence. He left. Yeah, I feel like that's pretty in character for him.
6994360	7022360	Fucking guy. Is he coming back? Hey, don't swear in front of the don't swear in front of the kick, baby. Okay, get a new rule. We don't bring up the K word. New rule. Yeah, new rule. Can we just let that be Avenger return to my arm? See here. Where were the most hills? Oh, north.
7024360	7052360	Wait, where the hills a specific color? Where you from goblin? They're just no, they're the same color as this. Okay. Sorry. Hey, music swells as we walk. We walk north north time passes. You see, you see far off a small village in a signpost that says rose book, a tiny little village. Please don't pillage. Yeah.
7054360	7083360	Can we take this sign seriously? Can we practice practice? We're not, we don't, we never pillage shit. We broke as a Job's Turkey, man. We don't have any fucking money. I don't know what that means. I don't like it. We destroy everything we touch. But we don't, we don't pillage. We just destroy. Okay, we want it anymore. Pillage implies gain. All right, let's go in. Be nice. Okay.
7083360	7095360	Okay, we're going to the village. We walk in. We walk into Rose book. It's like, yeah, you walk into Rose book and be prepared to face all the things it has to offer. It's 1005.
7095360	7119360	There we go. Let's take Stephanie, everybody for helping us out. Good luck with your web design. Let's also thank seek Donnelly and good luck with mono myth.
7119360	7145360	Come on. You can see him on the meltdown show on Comedy Central, Silicon Valley, of course, Mr. Crittenden, the dungeon master with the mostest. I'm Jeff Davis, your mayor is Dan Herman. Thank you. I would say of all cliffhangers, that has to be the most tantalizing. I think we really left the audience.
7145360	7151360	Good night. I'll drive safely or drive fast and take chances.
