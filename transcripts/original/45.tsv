0	21600	What I said, welcome back to Nerd Mountain Hollywood, California.
21600	22600	Guess what?
22600	29360	Harmon Town is now in session.
29360	44960	Will you please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmon Town, Mr. Dan Harmon.
44960	46960	Yeah!
46960	48960	Yeah!
48960	50960	Rap!
50960	65880	Great, we started at 8.06, it means, okay, so I always get confused when I look over
65880	68720	to that clock, I go, how long have we been up here?
68720	69720	Basically since 8.
69720	72640	So when it says 9.30, I've been up here for 90 minutes.
73640	75640	I'm insecure about our performance.
75640	77640	Dan, your hair looks great today.
77640	79640	Thank you.
79640	81640	I took a shower.
83640	87640	I raced home from work at Rick and Morty and I jumped in the shower.
87640	89640	And I didn't use sheet two.
89640	90640	That's not true, that's not true.
90640	92640	Alright, stop at the drawing room, you're right.
92640	94640	Yeah.
94640	96640	To tell you that I needed to take a shower.
96640	98640	But after an hour of drinking.
98640	103640	I mean, that's not, there's no reason for, I mean, let's.
103640	104640	Full disclosure.
104640	106640	Yeah, it's just your commitment to honesty.
106640	108640	Jeff Davis' commitment to honesty.
108640	111640	Yeah, I took a shower tonight.
111640	114640	You guys don't really usually see me after a shower.
114640	116640	And it's kind of exciting.
116640	119640	I don't know if I've ever been up here right after a shower.
119640	120640	No.
120640	124640	And I don't know if it changes me or not.
124640	125640	I don't know.
125640	126640	I clip my fingernails.
126640	128640	I'm not embarrassed about.
128640	130640	So when you groom, you commit to grooming.
130640	131640	Yeah, yeah.
131640	133640	I'm like, let's get back to basics here.
133640	137640	It's like a Narnia book, you know, where they go on a lot of adventures.
137640	142640	And then there's the chapter where they just go down to the riverbank and they scrub.
145640	150640	The author describes their ruddy cheeks and their glistening hair.
151640	154640	Then you just put down the book and jerk off.
154640	157640	It's like, that sounds like a clean lion.
160640	161640	I don't remember.
161640	164640	I just remember people like every once in a while they bathed in these medieval adventures.
164640	165640	That's all I know.
165640	168640	And so I do it medieval style.
177640	178640	Was that for real?
178640	179640	Was that for real?
179640	180640	That was not affected.
180640	184640	Because I've never been laughed at harder in school in fifth grade.
184640	186640	I raised my hand in social studies.
186640	188640	I knew the answer to a question.
188640	196640	And the teacher said, Jeff, I said like 30,000 times in the span of four seconds.
196640	198640	That was a real one.
198640	200640	I mean, I don't fake them.
200640	201640	Try to fake that.
201640	202640	You can't do it.
202640	203640	It's impossible.
203640	204640	Yeah, it's impossible.
204640	207640	I sound like a character from Cars or something.
208640	209640	I assume.
209640	211640	I haven't seen that movie.
212640	216640	Speaking of people who haven't seen movies, we're going to bring up a guest later on,
216640	219640	Jeff, who hasn't seen some key movies.
219640	221640	And we're going to talk to him about it.
221640	222640	That's a dumb teaser.
222640	223640	Dumb.
224640	226640	Well, because you have me.
226640	229640	That's not the purpose of a teaser as you go.
229640	233640	Later on coming up, a guy's going to come with an anaconda.
233640	235640	We're going to find out what it eats.
235640	238640	You don't say, hey, later on we're going to talk about shit.
238640	240640	That doesn't make any sense.
240640	245640	But later on, Dan's going to second guess what he says we're going to talk about.
245640	246640	What were we talking about?
246640	248640	Stammering, stuttering, hygiene.
248640	250640	Okay, here's the thing.
250640	260640	I was taking a shower today, and I was 40 years old, and Aaron had left a bottle of shampoo.
260640	263640	It spilled on the bottom of the toilet.
263640	264640	What do you call it?
264640	265640	The bathtub?
266640	271640	Where do you shit and where do you wash the shit out of your...
272640	276640	The bathtub was covered with shampoo.
276640	283640	And so when I got in it with my enormous, gross, walrus-like body,
283640	287640	the weight was just slipping and sliding.
287640	288640	There's no...
288640	293640	The old German couple that left me this house, they did a lot of weird things.
293640	296640	There's kitchen tiles in the kitchen that have the German word for honey on them
296640	298640	and a little bear going like, Sig Heil.
298640	302640	But there's all kinds of evidence, if you look for it,
302640	306640	that an old German couple owned my house and took very good care of it.
306640	312640	You might say they annexed the house and really brought a lot of order to it.
313640	315640	But that was...
318640	321640	Jeff took a Hustler cartoon character.
323640	328640	I like to think I delightfully skipped off the surface of that lake.
328640	330640	You made a bear a Nazi earlier.
331640	333640	Yeah, that's cute.
333640	335640	The bear offsets.
335640	337640	The drawer has gold teeth.
337640	339640	It's like a pupil all of a sudden.
339640	341640	Let's not fight, Jeff.
341640	343640	I'm having a delightful time.
343640	345640	Me too. I love you.
345640	347640	Your hair looks terrific.
347640	348640	Thank you.
348640	350640	Also, we're fucking loose.
350640	352640	The camera crew is not here anymore.
352640	358640	Not that they were bad people or that having a camera here was bad.
358640	360640	It's just fucking different.
360640	362640	Evil difference.
362640	363640	Here's the difference.
363640	367640	Because now, for the first time in about a month and a half, I can do this.
368640	371640	I can play licensed music.
375640	376640	Wow.
376640	381640	A place where copyrights don't apply.
382640	385640	Where Sony can fuck off and die.
385640	388640	They call it Canada.
391640	396640	Whitney Houston died of an overdose in a hotel.
397640	403640	And when her record started to sell, Sony charged more for it.
403640	404640	Look it up.
404640	407640	It's a fucking huge, ridiculous scandal.
408640	415640	If you just Google it, you will see that the company that fired me
415640	422640	is horrible and belongs in Nazi Germany.
422640	424640	And now we can steal.
424640	425640	Boom.
425640	426640	Oh, shwits.
426640	428640	Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
428640	430640	Sony.
430640	432640	Sony.
432640	435640	A drawer full of gold teeth.
435640	438640	Now that's marketable.
438640	439640	All right.
439640	441640	So, to get...
442640	444640	It feels good.
444640	445640	It feels good.
445640	446640	Yes, yes.
446640	447640	Yes, applaud.
447640	448640	Yeah.
448640	450640	Yes, you love it.
450640	453640	You guys had to go for two months without ELO.
453640	455640	And death camp references.
455640	457640	They love them both.
457640	461640	They eat them like s'mores, the chocolate and the marshmallow.
461640	466640	I stepped into the shower and I started slipping because she left the shampoo.
468640	469640	She left it...
469640	473640	She just squirted shampoo on the floor of the bathtub?
473640	474640	She's young.
474640	475640	She's vibrant.
475640	476640	She's got...
476640	477640	She's trying to kill you.
477640	478640	She's got...
479640	481640	This is the Agatha Christie novels.
482640	483640	She's got pods to cast.
483640	485640	She's got paintings to commission.
485640	486640	Boyfriends to murder.
486640	487640	Maybe.
487640	489640	But that would make more sense after...
489640	492640	So, she's leaving liquid soap on the floor like Downton Abbey.
492640	493640	It was...
494640	495640	Oh, is that...
495640	497640	Did people high five there?
497640	499640	I saw high fives out there.
500640	503640	The weird thing is there's three people in the front row here.
503640	509640	Two of them crossed over the person sitting in the middle of them to do a Downton Abbey high five.
509640	515640	So, he's either her boyfriend and doesn't truck with no Downton Abbey.
515640	519640	And he's the fucking Downton Abbey watching guy that's gonna fuck her after...
521640	522640	He's on deck.
525640	526640	Or...
526640	527640	I don't know.
527640	528640	Wait, what are the other...
528640	529640	I don't know any other configurations.
529640	531640	I was gonna say gay best friend.
531640	532640	Oh, okay.
532640	533640	You're right.
533640	534640	She said yes.
534640	535640	Are you the gay best friend?
535640	536640	Gay best friend.
536640	537640	Got it.
540640	543640	Gay best friend.
544640	545640	Wait, are you guys a couple?
545640	546640	No.
546640	547640	Oh, okay.
547640	549640	So, just straight friend.
549640	551640	You're just hanging out on deck and...
554640	556640	You're playing the platonic game.
556640	561640	She's gonna end up having a boyfriend, a straight platonic friend, and a gay best friend.
561640	562640	That's amazing.
562640	565640	And a gay guy's gonna have a straight best friend and they're gonna end up hooking up later on.
565640	568640	She's just gonna be like a Chinese kite just like with this...
569640	571640	Tale of...
571640	573640	This is an entourage.
575640	578640	Anyways, so I'm slipping in the shower.
579640	581640	No tangents tonight.
581640	582640	No tangents.
582640	586640	All of this has been germane to Jackson.
587640	588640	Dum, dum, dum, dum.
588640	590640	No word play tonight, no...
592640	594640	Jermaine to Jackson.
594640	597640	Of the type of tangents that aren't gonna happen tonight,
597640	600640	the first one is phonetic.
600640	604640	Just because you hear yourself say Jermaine, you don't have to say Jackson.
606640	608640	That's rule number one.
608640	612640	I was slipping in the shower and it made me hyper conscious of my environment.
612640	614640	Here's my thing, Jeff.
614640	615640	One of my many things.
615640	617640	I don't like showering.
617640	618640	I like bathing.
618640	621640	And thank you, thank you.
622640	627640	I realized what a treacherous place it is.
627640	630640	I started slipping and I was like, Jesus Christ.
630640	634640	I was like, oh, she left the shampoo and put it down the drain.
634640	636640	That's why people slip in the shower.
636640	640640	Wait, she just left a big glob of shampoo on the bottom of the shower floor?
640640	641640	Or a ghost knocked it down.
641640	642640	I don't know, man.
642640	648640	There was a shampoo bottle down on the floor of the tub.
648640	649640	Yeah, leaking shampoo.
649640	650640	Yeah.
650640	651640	So like an oil slick.
651640	652640	Right.
652640	654640	I was taking a hurried shower.
654640	658640	Maybe she wanted to kill me tonight and that's why she's not here.
658640	659640	Right.
659640	660640	She said she was sick.
660640	661640	She has an alibi.
661640	663640	She's in Belize right now.
663640	664640	None of that makes sense.
664640	666640	None of that makes sense.
666640	667640	Not a perfect crime.
667640	668640	I slip in the shower.
668640	672640	She gets no money because I'm just her boyfriend that slipped in a shower.
672640	674640	She's in the other room when it happens.
674640	676640	I still accuse her of murder.
676640	677640	None of it makes sense.
677640	681640	They would thrill you to no end but it doesn't make sense.
681640	688640	We love each other and we belong together and you're a bad person.
688640	693640	I became hyper conscious of the shower environment and I started to think to myself, you know
693640	698640	what, all of these houses that you always see on TV and the movies and in your own homes,
698640	700640	they always have a shower in them.
700640	702640	And I started to really sink in.
702640	706640	I think other people other than me really like to take showers.
706640	710640	Right.
710640	718640	So like, how many people in the room don't like taking showers?
718640	720640	Four.
720640	721640	Four or five?
721640	722640	Four or five?
722640	723640	Baths.
723640	724640	Okay.
724640	725640	Wait.
725640	726640	Baths.
726640	728640	You like baths.
728640	729640	Okay.
729640	730640	So those four people are bath people.
730640	733640	There's no question that a bath is better than a shower.
733640	734640	You don't have time.
734640	736640	The shower is an expedient.
736640	743640	But how many people in the room consider it a like, oh boy, I wish I could take a shower.
743640	750640	Like by applause.
750640	751640	That's the thing.
751640	756640	But also one of my favorite things is sometimes if you got the time, a little bit of both.
756640	761640	You plug the drain, you lay in there and you take a shower bath.
761640	763640	What bathtub can you fit in?
763640	765640	You're taller than me.
765640	767640	You just get down there and like...
767640	768640	You just lay down.
768640	771640	You look like a Herman Munster in a...
771640	773640	A sexy naked Herman Munster.
773640	776640	In a tiny little like go-kart.
776640	780640	You just lay down there and the water fills up and the water cools off a little quicker.
780640	781640	You have the hot water coming down.
781640	782640	It's the greatest.
782640	784640	I don't get nothing other than baths.
784640	785640	I don't get it.
785640	788640	Because like when my dishes are dirty, they got a little lasagna to scrape them off.
788640	790640	Like that's how, you know, like you soak them.
790640	792640	Soak the dish.
792640	793640	You don't spray it.
793640	796640	But you have a dishwasher and that's a shower.
796640	797640	Right.
797640	802640	But you have to scrub the dish before you put it in the dishwasher.
802640	809640	I soak the plates and or I hire a lady who may or may not be documented.
809640	811640	I don't know.
811640	815640	That's her business and that's not a tangent we're going to get off on.
815640	817640	But my plates are currently clean.
817640	820640	So are my balls because I soak them.
820640	822640	This is enough of this topic.
822640	826640	I was just thinking in my head while I was taking a shower today.
826640	828640	Like how much people like showers.
828640	829640	It's not like a toilet.
829640	831640	It's a different from a toilet.
831640	832640	The toilets there.
832640	833640	Nobody.
833640	835640	Well, sometimes pooping is fun.
835640	839640	Like because there's a thing coming out of your butt and you but it feels good.
839640	841640	So it's like putting a thing up your butt.
841640	842640	Same thing.
842640	843640	But it's coming out.
843640	846640	But then you have to wipe it and like it's poopy and I don't have to.
846640	849640	I probably don't have to explain this out of all the things I have to explain.
849640	853640	I probably know this is probably the last thing I have to explain.
853640	857640	You know pooping works and that there's a there's a thing in the bathroom that's
857640	858640	like there.
858640	859640	It's by necessity.
859640	864640	Like it really is there because a toilet is a bath for your poop.
864640	870640	And I always thought shower was also there by necessity because that was just as the
870640	874640	toilet was a device that kept poop from piling up.
874640	878640	The shower was a device that kept kids from picking on you.
878640	881640	That was how I like that.
881640	885640	That was that was how I was introduced to the concept of showering is that kids in the
885640	888640	playground going you don't shower.
888640	889640	You have to shower.
889640	890640	Fuck you.
890640	891640	You're an asshole.
891640	892640	You're a piece of shit.
892640	896640	But if you better get in that shower and be like well unlike when I get on the toilet
896640	898640	I don't actually it's not up to me.
898640	902640	Like I it's just it's just up to fucking Steve Ruel.
902640	907640	But if you've gotten up every morning and known at you know when you were in the fifth
907640	911640	grade that you liked baths and you took a bath every day you would have been clean and
911640	914640	they wouldn't have never would have been a topic right.
914640	917640	Yeah maybe but yeah maybe.
917640	922640	Yeah don't don't blame high cascading water.
922640	924640	It was just a bathing thing.
924640	929640	It was bathing can be showering or like submerging yourself in a tub.
930640	932640	I think that everybody should wake up every morning.
932640	933640	Not everybody.
933640	934640	I don't care what you guys do.
934640	936640	I would like it.
936640	937640	I would like that.
937640	940640	I would be comfortable if everybody woke up every morning of it.
940640	945640	I'm going to I'm going to take my little my little bath because that's how you get clean.
945640	951640	You soak your whole dirty body in like clean water and you can take a bath every day.
951640	956640	You can be you can be a sexy Calgon lady and you can get you can get in and have a little
956640	957640	bubble bath every morning.
957640	959640	Well I had my bath had to be fixed and now it is.
959640	964640	There's too much time in the bath as the old air supply song goes.
964640	968640	Too much time in the bath.
968640	969640	I don't know.
969640	972640	I don't know what band that is but it's not air supply.
972640	974640	Well that out sticks.
974640	975640	God damn it.
975640	979640	I was going to say fucking sticks but then I was like how many hits could they have sticks.
979640	982640	If you're listening and you're from sticks like I just paid you the biggest compliment
982640	983640	of the world.
983640	984640	I stopped myself.
984640	985640	I was like I was going to say sticks.
985640	986640	It was like too many hits.
986640	990640	They also have bathing.
990640	995640	When I'm wet I am cleaner.
995640	997640	Submerging.
997640	1000640	Dirty balls.
1000640	1002640	Sorry I can't do it.
1002640	1005640	Coming to the stage now Jeff.
1005640	1006640	Oh shit.
1006640	1007640	Yeah fuck it man.
1007640	1009640	Keep this thing rolling man.
1009640	1011640	That's what I learned on tour.
1011640	1012640	Keep it rolling.
1012640	1014640	Bring fresh faces up.
1014640	1015640	Get to know them.
1015640	1016640	Talk to them.
1016640	1021640	Let's bring it first up.
1021640	1024640	An old friend of Harmontown.
1024640	1027640	A week old.
1027640	1028640	Are you looking for a thing?
1028640	1029640	I'm stalling for you.
1029640	1030640	I'm good.
1030640	1031640	Okay.
1031640	1032640	Does he have a theme?
1032640	1033640	No I just got some sticks.
1033640	1036640	Oh okay.
1036640	1037640	An old friend.
1037640	1039640	He was here last week.
1039640	1043640	I like talking to him.
1043640	1059640	His name is Kumail Nanjiani.
1059640	1061640	Kumail from now on this is your theme.
1061640	1062640	I like it.
1062640	1064640	Not this one?
1064640	1070640	A different one?
1070640	1071640	This one?
1071640	1073640	Why?
1073640	1074640	You know what?
1074640	1083640	Fuck you.
1083640	1086640	Kumail's fighting with our tech guy.
1086640	1087640	Oh he was talking.
1087640	1088640	We're not fighting anymore.
1088640	1090640	I just won.
1090640	1092640	It's only a fight if yeah.
1092640	1093640	If it's still going on.
1093640	1094640	Yeah.
1094640	1095640	Can I say one thing?
1095640	1097640	I'm pro showering anti bathing.
1097640	1099640	I know you don't want to talk about this anymore.
1099640	1101640	I feel thank you.
1101640	1103640	Is this going to be about wasting water?
1103640	1104640	No.
1104640	1105640	God no.
1105640	1106640	No I'm pro showering.
1106640	1107640	Showering is more wasting water I think.
1107640	1108640	Is it?
1108640	1109640	No no that's not true.
1109640	1110640	We all did that in science class.
1110640	1111640	If you take a short shower.
1111640	1114640	If you plug the train to take a shower it doesn't fill the shower.
1114640	1116640	We did that in science class right gang?
1116640	1117640	What science class?
1117640	1119640	Were you home schooled?
1119640	1125640	It has to be all like if you put bread in this toaster it becomes toast.
1125640	1127640	It's just science based on what you guys had.
1127640	1135640	Camille, Dan went to Myth Busters High.
1135640	1151640	If you stand in the shower and plug the drain as often happens to 25 year olds because the drain gets naturally plugged by their inability to call their father who they owe $5,000 to and their smokers mucus.
1151640	1154640	It often happens the science experiments plays out.
1154640	1160640	The bathtub will not fill up in the time of an average shower.
1160640	1162640	You'd have to be in the shower for a long time to fill a bathtub.
1162640	1164640	I take long showers sometimes.
1164640	1172640	When I'm on the road like I was in Miami for a month alone before that I was in Baltimore alone for a couple weeks.
1172640	1176640	I would take just to pass the time I would take like five six showers a day.
1176640	1177640	What?
1177640	1180640	I would like look forward I would be like alright time for another shower.
1180640	1181640	What?
1181640	1182640	Baltimore?
1182640	1184640	What's not happening in Baltimore?
1184640	1185640	What is it?
1185640	1186640	Five six showers a day.
1186640	1188640	Dan you saw the wire.
1188640	1190640	It's that.
1190640	1193640	It's six showers or the wire.
1193640	1195640	That's Baltimore slogan.
1195640	1198640	Does the crack come out of the shower head?
1198640	1200640	Omar comes to get you.
1200640	1203640	You're only safe from Omar in the shower.
1203640	1206640	I got that pandemic.
1206640	1209640	Omar coming.
1209640	1211640	People are calling out.
1211640	1215640	More high-fiving in the background.
1215640	1217640	Only this time.
1217640	1219640	I got them WMB.
1219640	1220640	You hurt?
1220640	1221640	Yeah.
1221640	1228640	I think the bathing is weird because you're laying in your own filth for a while.
1228640	1229640	No.
1229640	1230640	Ron.
1230640	1232640	If you do a pre-shower.
1232640	1233640	Okay all right.
1233640	1234640	Jerry.
1234640	1235640	Jerry.
1235640	1236640	Jerry.
1236640	1237640	Jerry.
1237640	1239640	You know that.
1239640	1240640	Here's okay.
1240640	1243640	It's like your ball and butt filth.
1243640	1246640	Finish your thought and then let me counter.
1246640	1247640	Or can I count it now?
1247640	1249640	I feel like I finished my thought.
1249640	1250640	Okay all right.
1250640	1251640	All right.
1251640	1254640	Of course I've thought about that.
1254640	1255640	I'm in hell with it.
1255640	1258640	Also so condescending.
1258640	1263640	Also in science class what we learned is the whole point of water as a cleaning agent.
1263640	1265640	It is the universal solvent.
1265640	1268640	Water binds to things, takes them away.
1268640	1270640	It doesn't put them back.
1270640	1272640	No but it's still there.
1272640	1273640	It's bound to water.
1273640	1274640	It's just hanging out though.
1274640	1276640	It doesn't fucking attach to you.
1276640	1278640	But it's still gross.
1278640	1282640	That's only half of my counter.
1282640	1290640	The other half is assuming that being near dirt actually makes you dirty.
1290640	1294640	If it's like in a water dirt solution.
1294640	1299360	What you are asserting without knowing you're asserting it is the absurd science fiction
1299360	1300360	notion.
1300360	1303160	I feel like I've already lost.
1303160	1311320	That a shower head propels water hard enough and consistently enough that it blasts the
1311320	1315640	dirt off of your body like a laser gun.
1315640	1320640	And that every little flake of dirt as opposed to the simple can I finish?
1320640	1321640	Can I finish?
1321640	1322640	That's 45 seconds.
1322640	1323640	45 seconds.
1323640	1325640	As opposed to the simple assertion.
1325640	1327640	Harmon, Harmon, stand down.
1327640	1329640	Stand down.
1329640	1332640	Senator, your time is up, sir.
1332640	1333640	I'm scrubbing.
1333640	1334640	Okay, I'm scrubbing.
1334640	1341640	Let the senator from Pakistan rebut.
1341640	1345640	Was the punchline there just Pakistan?
1345640	1346640	It's a funny country.
1346640	1347640	It's got a lot of K's in it.
1347640	1348640	It is.
1348640	1349640	The one.
1349640	1350640	Yeah, it is.
1351640	1357640	Pakistan has senators that are very passionate about shower versus bathing.
1357640	1361640	Senator from Pakistan, where would he start?
1361640	1364640	Okay, well, I want to say two things.
1364640	1368640	One, you mentioned it's a science fiction notion.
1368640	1371640	That would be the worst sci-fi movie of all time.
1371640	1373640	Fair enough.
1373640	1378640	Also, I was going to say something horrible.
1378640	1381640	Do you know who knows how strong water...
1381640	1382640	I'm not going to say it, but...
1382640	1383640	What?
1383640	1384640	Say it.
1384640	1386640	Civil War, civil rights protesters know.
1386640	1387640	Civil rights.
1387640	1388640	Okay.
1388640	1391640	Does it make them clean?
1391640	1393640	Yeah.
1393640	1396640	That's a fair point, dad.
1396640	1399640	But the other thing is I'm scrubbing while I'm in the shower.
1399640	1403640	I'm not just like in there like, water, do your magic and then get out.
1403640	1404640	Right, you scrub.
1404640	1405640	Okay, fine.
1405640	1407640	I'm scrubbing and then the water is going down there.
1407640	1415640	Even if it's not binding itself to me, would you get on a six hour flight next to just like a shit, like a turd?
1415640	1418640	Even though it's not binding to you, you know it's there.
1418640	1421640	When you're eating, it's like looking at you.
1421640	1422640	That's not fair.
1422640	1424640	The shit is made out of shit.
1424640	1426640	The shit is made out of shit.
1426640	1431640	Is your hang up with showering because people said you don't shower, you're dirty.
1431640	1433640	Is the verb showering?
1433640	1434640	Kind of.
1434640	1435640	It's the verb.
1435640	1437640	Either way, it's water rinsing.
1437640	1439640	The water stings me a little bit.
1439640	1441640	What does it?
1441640	1445640	You're sarcastic, as Julie noted.
1445640	1449640	All right.
1449640	1453640	The water hits you too hard.
1453640	1455640	You guys are all...
1455640	1457640	I'm a writer in Hollywood.
1457640	1460640	The water hurts.
1460640	1469640	You guys are all welcome to a giant bin of dime a dozen hero medals for people who gang up on people.
1469640	1471640	I mean, there's a bin full of them.
1471640	1472640	No, it's logic.
1472640	1474640	I knew when I asked them, I said, who loves showering?
1474640	1475640	They all said, yay.
1475640	1476640	They all love it.
1476640	1477640	I'm not.
1477640	1478640	I'm not.
1478640	1479640	I'm a hero for talk.
1479640	1481640	Remember the lady who said she liked Batman risings?
1481640	1483640	Yeah.
1483640	1484640	Is she here, by the way?
1484640	1485640	She tried to bully her.
1485640	1486640	She's like a folk hero.
1487640	1492640	But Dan, is it the act of standing up while stinky water hits you?
1492640	1494640	Because that's fair enough.
1494640	1495640	If you don't like...
1495640	1497640	I'm six foot four.
1497640	1498640	I prefer in the morning.
1498640	1500640	I sit down when I pee.
1500640	1501640	Why?
1501640	1503640	Because I'm tall and I'm tired.
1503640	1504640	You know what?
1504640	1505640	You know what?
1505640	1506640	Me too.
1506640	1508640	I sit down when I pee.
1508640	1509640	You're the biggest sitting down...
1509640	1511640	Not out of your house, you morons.
1511640	1512640	What?
1512640	1514640	You guys are fucking freaks.
1514640	1515640	Why are you trying to prove?
1515640	1518640	I came from the ceiling when I pee.
1518640	1521640	I can't get high enough.
1521640	1523640	What are you, women?
1523640	1529640	I stand in a tight rope and punch a lion while I pee.
1529640	1531640	I don't even pee.
1531640	1532640	I just...
1532640	1535640	You blast civil rights protesters.
1535640	1536640	Yeah.
1536640	1544640	And they come out still cleaner than if they had loved the government.
1545640	1551640	I'm not even sure what lines we've drawn now.
1551640	1557640	I don't even know either, because if you think about what I said, I said, then if they loved
1557640	1560640	the government, which the moral then would be that they shouldn't have.
1560640	1561640	They shouldn't have.
1561640	1562640	They would do it wrong.
1562640	1563640	You're a flex of boowers.
1563640	1566640	Eat your plate of crow.
1566640	1568640	Reflexive boowers.
1568640	1570640	Where will you go?
1570640	1574640	After the show, I'd like a plate of crow to eat up from the time I boo Dan Harmon.
1574640	1579640	Because I react to words instead of feelings.
1579640	1582640	That's you.
1582640	1586640	You guys need a fucking linguistic shower.
1586640	1588640	Or a linguistic bath.
1588640	1590640	What's better? A linguistic shower?
1590640	1591640	I'd rather they take a bath.
1591640	1594640	It'll absolve them more.
1594640	1596640	I feel like...
1596640	1601640	I think the sweet spot is if you have the time and you're tired, is laying down in the tub
1601640	1603640	and let the water hit you.
1603640	1604640	But you know what?
1604640	1607640	Laying down in the shower feels real sad.
1607640	1609640	It feels like post-rape or something.
1609640	1611640	Yeah.
1611640	1613640	Yes.
1613640	1615640	Get it off me.
1615640	1618640	After I've had good sex, I go into the bathroom and take a little...
1618640	1621640	That's what you call good sex?
1621640	1624640	I take a little rape bath afterwards.
1624640	1627640	I get a little...
1627640	1628640	That's a grape.
1628640	1629640	I love that.
1629640	1631640	I can't believe I like things in my ass.
1631640	1633640	I love that that's a thing.
1633640	1634640	Rape bath.
1634640	1636640	Like a real estate person.
1636640	1637640	Like, alright.
1637640	1639640	So as you can see, wooden floors, great curtains.
1639640	1641640	There's a rape bath here.
1641640	1642640	I'm sorry.
1642640	1644640	You're a career woman.
1644640	1646640	You're moving up in the water.
1646640	1647640	A rape bath?
1647640	1649640	You know what is not good?
1649640	1650640	You know what nobody likes?
1650640	1651640	A rape shower.
1651640	1652640	A rape shower is the worst.
1652640	1654640	Well, he was saying, I mean, that's the thing.
1654640	1657640	If you're sitting in the shower, it's because you're either been abducted by aliens or...
1657640	1658640	Or have been taken.
1658640	1661640	Or you just found out that Finkel is Einhorn.
1664640	1665640	What?
1665640	1667640	That was a real deep...
1667640	1668640	Deep cut.
1668640	1669640	Real deep-ace Ventura.
1669640	1670640	Deep cut.
1670640	1673640	We need a character for deep cuts.
1673640	1675640	I just high-fived a gay guy.
1675640	1676640	I don't know what you said.
1676640	1678640	I just felt like that would make it better.
1678640	1680640	It's a humble brag.
1680640	1689640	Everybody high-fiving the gay guy.
1689640	1691640	Everybody high-five the gay guy.
1691640	1694640	High-five the gay guy.
1694640	1696640	It's like the Blarney Stode.
1696640	1701640	High-five the gay guy.
1701640	1708640	It makes you feel a little less straight.
1709640	1715640	High-fiving as I walk across them with me.
1715640	1717640	Dumb.
1717640	1720640	High-five the gay guy feels like a...
1720640	1722640	A fancy version of Smear the Queer.
1722640	1723640	Yeah.
1723640	1726640	Like a PC update.
1726640	1727640	Like we fixed it.
1727640	1729640	Martin Luther King made that speech.
1729640	1735640	I have a dream that one day the children will play high-five the gay guy instead of smear the queer.
1735640	1737640	Instead of smear the queer.
1737640	1739640	I'm going to punch him in the fucking stomach.
1739640	1740640	That was one.
1740640	1745640	I apologize to Enti who was sitting in the front row because when we were playing certain games,
1745640	1747640	we would pick who was it.
1747640	1750640	Midwestern Wisconsin it was the 70s, 80s.
1750640	1752640	We'd go Eeny Meeny Miny Mo.
1752640	1754640	And we didn't always say catch the tiger by the toe.
1754640	1755640	No.
1755640	1757640	We definitely in Pakistan did not say tiger.
1757640	1758640	Wait.
1758640	1759640	You got...
1759640	1760640	Wait.
1760640	1761640	What?
1761640	1762640	What did you say?
1762640	1763640	Jew?
1763640	1764640	Oh, yeah.
1764640	1765640	No.
1765640	1766640	That doesn't rhyme.
1766640	1767640	That was your...
1767640	1769640	You guys were like into rhyming?
1769640	1770640	Yeah.
1770640	1772640	Everybody's into rhyming.
1772640	1776640	Hearts beat beneath these chests.
1776640	1778640	Jew-hating hearts.
1778640	1780640	I thought...
1780640	1781640	No.
1781640	1782640	I need to go over there and like...
1782640	1783640	No.
1783640	1784640	It's skippable.
1790640	1793640	Is that on the pamphlet of the hotel lobby?
1793640	1794640	Yeah.
1795640	1798640	The Pakistan's Wonder Spot.
1798640	1800640	Your car will go uphill.
1800640	1802640	It's skippable.
1802640	1804640	We didn't say tiger.
1804640	1805640	We said the n-word.
1805640	1806640	Okay.
1806640	1807640	But I forgot.
1807640	1810640	We played a whole game called Smear the Queer.
1810640	1814640	And the reason I forgot is because I never really thought about it.
1814640	1821640	Never thought, oh, this game will keep gay people from infiltrating society or voting
1821640	1822640	or getting married.
1822640	1823640	I was never thinking that.
1823640	1824640	You just taught that as a kid.
1824640	1825640	Sure.
1825640	1827640	I'm not saying it's good or permissible.
1827640	1829640	I'm just saying when you're a kid, you're pure.
1829640	1830640	You really don't.
1830640	1831640	There's no reason.
1831640	1832640	Yeah.
1832640	1835640	The only people who can say the n-word are black people and kids, right?
1835640	1837640	They can...
1837640	1840640	And white comedy writers who are...
1840640	1841640	Can I...
1841640	1843640	...paking a sandwich by themselves.
1843640	1845640	Can I pitch that as a title of this episode?
1848640	1850640	Kids say the n-word things.
1850640	1855640	Kids say the n-word-est things in between gay bashing.
1855640	1857640	Honestly, we say...
1857640	1858640	I'm just saying.
1858640	1859640	I forgot about Smear the Queer.
1859640	1860640	That's all.
1860640	1865640	Because I bothered to apologize to our soul.
1865640	1866640	Our soul.
1866640	1868640	That's it.
1868640	1872640	Our only black Armenian.
1872640	1873640	Wait.
1873640	1875640	What do you think queer means?
1876640	1880640	Why are you apologizing to the black person?
1880640	1887640	I'm saying I'm obsessed with race, but I'm not as obsessed with homophobia.
1887640	1891640	I feel like the equation was race and homophobia.
1891640	1893640	Not race and homosexuality.
1893640	1895640	The equation is racism and homophobia.
1895640	1901640	I'm saying I need to put a couple more poker chips on double zero for the gay people.
1902640	1905640	Although they wake up and can totally pass for white.
1905640	1908640	I mean...
1908640	1909640	So...
1909640	1910640	Yeah.
1910640	1911640	That's...
1911640	1913640	Boo hoo hoo.
1913640	1916640	We can only find out you're gay.
1916640	1919640	If you say you prefer penises, do vaginas.
1919640	1920640	Black people...
1920640	1923640	When's that going to come up with a loan officer?
1923640	1926640	Yeah, with black people you can tell over the phone.
1932640	1935640	This is my favorite Harvard town ever.
1935640	1939640	If you're a gay guy and you want to blend into straight society,
1939640	1942640	it's as simple as growing a big bushy mustache.
1944640	1945640	Is that right?
1945640	1948640	By the way, Pakistan was very, very racist.
1948640	1952640	Against Jewish people, of course.
1952640	1954640	Hindus, of course.
1954640	1956640	But also black people.
1956640	1957640	Really?
1957640	1958640	We didn't have any black people.
1958640	1960640	So weird.
1960640	1961640	Yeah.
1961640	1963640	So what was that about?
1964640	1967640	I think we were going off you guys.
1968640	1969640	We were like...
1969640	1972640	You know when the big bully at school is like,
1972640	1973640	the cool guy is like,
1973640	1974640	this is what we hate.
1974640	1976640	Oh, okay, we hate it too.
1977640	1979640	It's like in every after school special,
1979640	1981640	yeah, the dirty bully.
1981640	1983640	Like, beach again, you follow him home,
1983640	1985640	and of course his house is all shitty.
1985640	1986640	That's America.
1986640	1988640	That's America, because when we were there,
1988640	1991640	we just see like Snoopy and Garfield
1991640	1994640	and all the animal ones, you know.
1994640	1997640	Then you come here and it's fucking Jerry Springer and stuff.
1997640	1998640	We don't see that stuff.
1998640	2000640	We see Baywatch, which is great.
2001640	2004640	All right, I think it's time to keep the bullet train rolling.
2004640	2006640	We've got shit to talk to Spencer about.
2006640	2008640	We need to bring Spencer up here.
2012640	2014640	For you first time listeners,
2014640	2016640	Spencer is our attention master.
2017640	2019640	Spencer Crittenden, everybody.
2025640	2026640	Happy birthday.
2026640	2028640	Spencer is 24 years old.
2033640	2035640	One step closer to death.
2036640	2041640	Spencer Crittenden slowly edges along the never-ending river of chronology.
2042640	2045640	He'll always be younger than Dan,
2045640	2048640	but that doesn't excuse him.
2049640	2050640	From what?
2050640	2051640	I don't know.
2051640	2052640	It's from Indiana Jones.
2052640	2053640	Not that you would know.
2053640	2054640	What a great segue.
2054640	2055640	Segue!
2055640	2058640	Because we just found out in the green room
2058640	2061640	that Spencer Crittenden, human snowdrift.
2061640	2062640	What?
2062640	2063640	Wait, what does that mean?
2063640	2064640	Well, I'll tell you.
2064640	2065640	Okay.
2065640	2070640	Has never seen a single Back to the Future or Indiana Jones movie.
2070640	2071640	Wow.
2072640	2073640	Fuck you guys.
2074640	2075640	He's a unicorn.
2076640	2077640	You haven't either?
2077640	2078640	I haven't.
2078640	2081640	Who hasn't seen Indiana Jones or Back to the Future movies?
2081640	2082640	Two girls.
2082640	2085640	Why is this something to be proud of?
2086640	2088640	Because of 22.
2088640	2089640	How old are you?
2089640	2090640	23.
2090640	2091640	23.
2091640	2092640	How old are you?
2092640	2093640	22.
2093640	2094640	See, I got it.
2094640	2095640	But there's a lot of...
2095640	2098640	I mean, this audience is a sea of people Spencer's age.
2098640	2100640	I don't think it's an age thing.
2100640	2101640	I don't think it's an age thing.
2101640	2102640	I think it's an age thing plus...
2102640	2105640	It's an age thing but you guys assume it's an age thing.
2105640	2108640	I think everyone my age has definitely had to see.
2108640	2114640	Like their actual stormtroopers came to your house and drove you to the movie theater
2114640	2115640	and made you watch.
2115640	2116640	I was four years old.
2116640	2120640	I remember being four years old when Star Wars came out at the Orange Cinerama Dome
2120640	2125640	and I remember my dad picking me up out of the theater and walking to the parking lot
2125640	2128640	because I was crying when Darth Vader came out.
2128640	2130640	Because I was fucking four.
2130640	2135640	And there was a guy shaped like an evil black cock came out.
2135640	2137640	It's a big deal man.
2137640	2141640	And I was raised Pakistani so you know how hard that must have been.
2141640	2146640	We hate black cock.
2146640	2149640	Nothing scarier than a big powerful black cock.
2149640	2155640	Our actual slogan was, it's Pakistan not blackestan.
2155640	2157640	Spencer, I have a question for you.
2157640	2158640	Yes.
2158640	2159640	Shower or bath?
2160640	2162640	You know, I'm going to go with some of the audience members.
2162640	2165640	I enjoy a good shower bath now and again.
2165640	2166640	Shower or bath?
2166640	2167640	Yeah, yeah.
2167640	2168640	So you crouch down?
2168640	2171640	I crumple myself into a small fetal form.
2171640	2172640	Yeah.
2172640	2173640	Because you're tall, right?
2173640	2174640	How tall are you?
2174640	2175640	Three, four?
2175640	2176640	I'm six, three or four.
2176640	2177640	Yeah, like same as me.
2177640	2179640	And we don't fit in normal bathtubs.
2179640	2185640	No, like you know on tour, like there was two bath, you know, showers that were,
2185640	2188640	that were, I could stand up.
2188640	2189640	Those were ceiling mounted.
2189640	2191640	There was only one that you and I could share.
2191640	2192640	Yeah.
2192640	2199640	It was a real taxing time for us, you guys.
2199640	2203640	But yeah, the combo is the best, I have to say.
2203640	2210640	The combos, I'm not being patriotic about it, but the combo I don't get because when
2210640	2216640	you're, the only reason I can finally take baths is because I bought a house that has
2216640	2219640	this sunken Dolly Parton bath in it.
2219640	2224640	It's very big, and my giant, I'm not as tall as Jeff or Spencer.
2224640	2226640	I'm six foot, period.
2226640	2232640	And I've often tried, I've tried, on the tour.
2232640	2234640	I was like, Aaron would go.
2234640	2236640	You don't want to take baths in hotel bathrooms?
2236640	2237640	You want to take a bath?
2237640	2238640	Yeah, I'll take a nice relaxing bath.
2238640	2242640	Like Hannah Barbera cartoon, like my knees are next to my ears.
2242640	2243640	It's silly.
2243640	2245640	Nothing's getting soaked for me.
2245640	2248640	I want to soak my body, soak it, like a dirty dish.
2248640	2250640	It's about simulated rainfall.
2250640	2253640	I'm from California where it never rains.
2253640	2254640	Rain is exciting.
2254640	2259640	So the idea of being in a shower and rain hitting you is like this visceral experience.
2259640	2264640	I do have one, I always want to someday have a house where the entire ceiling is a shower.
2264640	2265640	Yeah.
2265640	2267640	So you can just kind of walk around everywhere.
2267640	2269640	I think I could handle that.
2269640	2272640	I think I've been at like Hawaiian resorts and things.
2272640	2276640	Every once in a while your hotel room will like, you'll luck out and you're like, what the fuck?
2276640	2281640	And there will be like a crazy rich person thing where like, I can handle that.
2281640	2287640	You get the Joan Crawford mommy dearest shower where there's like 19 jets in every direction, the best.
2287640	2288640	Yeah, that'll do.
2288640	2293640	So we can all agree, let's all be rich and live in Hawaii where also the temperature doesn't change.
2293640	2295640	That's the other thing about a shower.
2295640	2297640	Well, you're going to contradict that.
2297640	2298640	No, no, no, go ahead.
2298640	2300640	It's a safe environment.
2300640	2301640	Here's the thing.
2301640	2305640	Let me walk you through taking a shower.
2305640	2306640	Wow.
2306640	2308640	You get all your clothes.
2308640	2309640	You get all your clothes.
2309640	2315640	If you've just tuned in, we're about to blow Prairie Home Companion out of the fucking water.
2315640	2318640	Wait, I'll tell you this one thing.
2318640	2319640	Okay.
2319640	2324640	First of all, it's very presumptuous of you walking me through a shower.
2324640	2328640	But also if you have to do that, you don't have to start with me having my clothes on.
2328640	2329640	We could skip that.
2329640	2331640	This is exactly the point I'm talking about.
2331640	2332640	Okay, okay, okay.
2332640	2333640	See, this is everything that you take for granted.
2333640	2336640	You don't understand what it's like to be me.
2336640	2338640	You don't get it.
2338640	2339640	No, I don't.
2339640	2341640	My clothes are on.
2341640	2343640	They're already on.
2343640	2347640	Taking them off, that's a big deal.
2347640	2349640	It's like all kinds of shit.
2349640	2351640	I'm taking all my clothes off.
2351640	2354640	I think everyone else in the room is like, oh, I can't wait to get all these clothes off.
2354640	2357640	I'm like, god damn it, fucking another sock?
2357640	2358640	Really?
2358640	2361640	Two feet I have?
2361640	2362640	Backwards I talk?
2362640	2365640	I'm a lazy person.
2365640	2366640	Like a lazy, lazy.
2366640	2368640	So it's a lazy thing, taking clothes off?
2368640	2373640	Take all of them off knowing that I'm about to put them all back on?
2373640	2374640	Insanity.
2374640	2380640	So the thing that goes between that event, like I want it to be ritualistic and thorough.
2381640	2390640	I want my big, pendulous, ursine, greasy, nasty asshole, privacy balls to be subjected.
2390640	2391640	You have ursine?
2391640	2392640	Not to a light dashing.
2392640	2393640	Ursine balls?
2393640	2394640	Ursine.
2394640	2398640	They're like, you have balls like bears?
2398640	2402640	Look, we have a surprise guest here.
2402640	2404640	He needs to sound in.
2404640	2407640	Johnny Bear Balls.
2407640	2409640	We're on the wilderness theme.
2409640	2416640	Ladies and gentlemen, Bobcat Goldsway.
2416640	2423640	Hey buddy.
2423640	2424640	Wow.
2424640	2426640	I didn't know we had guests tonight.
2426640	2428640	That's what I get for showing up late.
2428640	2430640	We've graduated to surprise guests.
2430640	2434640	I feel like Bob Hope or something.
2434640	2439640	That's a reference that you guys would really grasp.
2439640	2441640	We remember that he was a guy.
2441640	2444640	They don't even know what Bob Hope did.
2444640	2450640	You know who he is, but he was famous for walking out and doing, you know, he'd stop in.
2450640	2453640	But it was his way of really squirting his musk.
2453640	2457640	It was his way of showing, yeah, you know, fuck you Johnny Carson.
2457640	2461640	I'll just come over and crap right in your mouth during a broadcast.
2461640	2463640	I'm paraphrasing.
2463640	2466640	Bob, he didn't really say that.
2466640	2468640	No, he made jokes about churro.
2468640	2470640	Showers or baths?
2470640	2472640	Showers or bath?
2472640	2474640	Showers, showers.
2474640	2475640	All right, fine.
2475640	2476640	Yeah, you're cornered, man.
2476640	2478640	Are you down with the bath?
2478640	2482640	And I just don't like showering, and if I'm clean it's because I took a bath.
2482640	2483640	But what is it about the shower?
2483640	2486640	Is it the physical act of standing and being hit by water,
2486640	2490640	or is it the fact that people told you as a kid that you don't shower your bath?
2490640	2491640	All right, it's all of the above.
2491640	2492640	It starts in the playground.
2492640	2496640	The worst people in the world, the worst people that you would ever want controlling society
2496640	2502640	as the first purveyors of the information, you need to take more showers.
2502640	2505640	Dude, I take like three showers a day.
2505640	2509640	I wish I didn't have to go to school so I could take more showers.
2509640	2514640	And I'm just going like, okay, fucking asshole shower, asshole shower,
2514640	2516640	beating me up because I don't take showers.
2517640	2524640	A lot of your school's hierarchy, social hierarchy, was based on shower frequency.
2524640	2527640	Yes, as far as I'm concerned, yes.
2527640	2531640	So, I mean, maybe that's not a reality, but that was my emotional experience.
2531640	2532640	That's exactly how I thought of it.
2532640	2535640	That guys would go out and they'd throw a football as far as they could,
2535640	2537640	and they'd go, was it 40?
2537640	2538640	What, 45?
2538640	2540640	45's better than 40.
2540640	2544640	All right, I took so many showers today.
2544640	2547640	And I'd be like, I can read everything.
2547640	2553640	But what if somebody said, the captain of the football team said,
2553640	2556640	I prefer just soaking in a nice leisurely bath.
2556640	2560640	I would probably be the world's greatest tight end.
2560640	2562640	Or linebacker or whatever he is.
2562640	2563640	But here's the problem.
2563640	2564640	That was an unfortunate pun.
2564640	2566640	Too many dots to connect.
2566640	2573640	But when you're in the bath, you're making your own...
2573640	2574640	God damn it.
2574640	2576640	This is exactly right.
2576640	2583640	You're making Dan Harmon a Jew.
2583640	2584640	That's exactly right.
2584640	2587640	But is it a metaphor for where you are in life?
2587640	2590640	Are you just sitting in this hot mess?
2590640	2593640	Is that the more narcissistic way to bathe?
2593640	2596640	Is to just stew in your own juice?
2596640	2598640	You're stewing your own juice.
2598640	2602640	You don't want the talent to go down the drain.
2602640	2608640	I don't want to lose any of my essence.
2608640	2613640	I'm just going to put it back into me through a series of hot injections.
2613640	2615640	The shower robs you of your essential oils.
2615640	2616640	What do you guys think I'd do?
2616640	2620640	Do you think I'd bottle it and put it in the firewood pile?
2620640	2621640	I think you're drinking it.
2621640	2625640	And it says the secret on the label.
2625640	2631640	I enjoy being clean, but not in terms with these guys.
2631640	2632640	So it was three parts.
2632640	2635640	It was that, and then it was the fact that, okay, here's the deal.
2635640	2637640	When you turn in the shower...
2637640	2639640	Okay, and everyone go ahead.
2639640	2642640	Bob, before you got here, everyone already made fun of me for this.
2642640	2645640	The water hurts.
2645640	2647640	It stings.
2647640	2650640	It stings when it hits the surface of my skin.
2650640	2652640	And I'm only going to say this once, and I have not...
2652640	2655640	I'm getting shit chills for you for saying that out loud.
2655640	2660640	I'm not diagnosing myself, but I have...
2660640	2664640	In my head, the whole body, the skin...
2664640	2665640	It hurts.
2665640	2670640	In my head, your shower says Sony on it, by the way.
2670640	2672640	I wouldn't be surprised.
2672640	2675640	To me, all those tubes lead to one place, yeah, for sure.
2675640	2678640	It's a big pyramid in space, just pumping out things that...
2678640	2681640	Did you have a terrible shower nozzle?
2681640	2684640	I've experienced enough different lenses by now.
2684640	2686640	In college, I had a shower in multiple dorms,
2686640	2688640	and it was that little nozzle that...
2688640	2692640	It was just being sandblasted to pieces.
2692640	2695640	I think maybe that's where my love of sitting down in the shower came from,
2695640	2698640	is if you stood up at 6 foot 4, if you got that on the shoulders,
2698640	2701640	it took off the first couple layers of skin.
2701640	2705640	So I think I just learned to curl down in a corner and let the rain fall.
2705640	2707640	I only bring this up because there's so much contention.
2707640	2711640	I'm not diagnosing myself, but I have in all my research...
2711640	2722640	It is a spectrum thing where it's tactile stinging with the water and the thing.
2722640	2723640	Really?
2723640	2726640	But I'm not playing that hard or I just dip.
2726640	2728640	I don't know if it's in the BSM, bro.
2728640	2729640	I think it's like...
2729640	2732640	But see, to me, the shower is also...
2732640	2734640	And maybe have your back on in this...
2734640	2739640	It's the Lifetime movie where you go after the rape.
2739640	2741640	This is my other point.
2741640	2742640	Wait, so...
2742640	2744640	Bob, you and I are the same person.
2744640	2745640	Did you make that right?
2745640	2746640	It's like looking into a mirror.
2746640	2747640	We are twinsies.
2747640	2748640	A future mirror.
2748640	2749640	Basically, I get that a lot.
2749640	2750640	Okay, Bob...
2750640	2752640	A future mirror.
2752640	2753640	So Bob, clearly...
2753640	2755640	I'm a balding fat white guy.
2755640	2756640	How did that happen?
2756640	2758640	A bit of baby to me.
2758640	2761640	Wait, so Bob, clearly you weren't here for the first 30 minutes of the show.
2761640	2762640	Just as a test.
2762640	2765640	Eenie, meenie, miney mo, catcha...
2765640	2767640	Oh.
2768640	2770640	Are you from Pakistan?
2770640	2771640	Same person.
2771640	2773640	You're the same guy.
2781640	2782640	No, I would've went with...
2782640	2785640	Secret Pakistani?
2785640	2786640	No, I came from...
2786640	2789640	My family was...
2789640	2790640	How can I say this?
2790640	2791640	I didn't...
2791640	2796640	I didn't know that they were called Brazil nuts.
2796640	2797640	Oh, no, I know.
2797640	2800640	Yeah, they're called N-word toes.
2800640	2801640	Yeah, yeah.
2801640	2802640	I was like, what?
2802640	2806640	Yeah, half of my family's from Oklahoma.
2806640	2809640	Yeah, those are not called Brazil nuts.
2809640	2812640	Would you ever have a thing with those black person at your house
2812640	2814640	and you had to be like, how would you want to have some?
2814640	2815640	Oh, no.
2815640	2816640	Is that how you realize?
2816640	2822640	But nobody would be like, aren't we being racist to Brazilians?
2822640	2825640	Well, but Brazilians is not a bad word.
2825640	2826640	Like, if we were calling them...
2826640	2827640	I would call them...
2827640	2828640	Bikini hay wax heads or something.
2828640	2830640	Yeah, that's what we're saying.
2830640	2832640	These are odd shaped Brazilian nuts.
2832640	2833640	Little tiny sharp nuts.
2833640	2838640	They have long pyramid shaped wrinkling.
2838640	2840640	All right.
2840640	2847640	I mean, not that every nut is an opportunity to get your, you know, racist agenda.
2847640	2848640	Maybe they're from Brazil.
2848640	2849640	Let's look into it afterwards.
2849640	2852640	Let's nuts maybe from Brazil.
2852640	2854640	I think they are.
2854640	2857640	I don't think they resemble Brazilian people.
2857640	2858640	But also...
2858640	2861640	But they do resemble the toes of black people, Jeff?
2861640	2862640	I didn't say that.
2862640	2863640	You do.
2863640	2864640	No, I didn't.
2864640	2866640	Bob can't do it.
2866640	2868640	I'm so sorry tonight, folks.
2868640	2871640	What if a black guy's foot really looked like that?
2871640	2873640	Like, identically?
2873640	2875640	Brazilian nuts the same length.
2875640	2878640	Well, it still wouldn't be okay because that word's not...
2878640	2879640	Yeah, it helps them don't...
2879640	2881640	I'm sorry.
2882640	2884640	Because I...
2884640	2886640	That's a food group.
2886640	2889640	My family always called pecans Korean fingers.
2892640	2893640	Pecans?
2893640	2895640	Well, la di da.
2895640	2896640	Oh.
2896640	2897640	Pecan.
2897640	2899640	Is that an actual pecan riff?
2899640	2900640	Pecans.
2900640	2902640	Pasha.
2902640	2903640	How dare you, sir.
2903640	2905640	Well, hello, Mary.
2906640	2911640	My family calls corn syrup poor people fuel.
2913640	2914640	Is that true?
2914640	2917640	We couldn't even afford Sunny Delight.
2918640	2921640	In Pakistan, we call cashew nuts cashew nuts.
2921640	2923640	Whoa, whoa, nice.
2923640	2926640	Why are there nuts?
2926640	2927640	Nuts not...
2927640	2928640	Nuts not...
2928640	2931640	Yeah, because it's not only...
2931640	2935640	An euphemism for men's genitals.
2935640	2940640	It's also how you describe mentally ill people.
2940640	2943640	And they're like, we're just an excellent source of protein, guys.
2943640	2944640	Yeah, we never asked that.
2944640	2946640	Just everybody back up.
2946640	2949640	All we did was be cultivated by accident.
2949640	2950640	We didn't do anything wrong.
2950640	2951640	That's weird.
2951640	2953640	How did it become...
2953640	2955640	The balls thing I understand because it's like...
2955640	2958640	I guess I kind of do, although why wouldn't you...
2958640	2965640	Maybe in Stone Age times, the only thing slightly resembling that was like rocks and nuts.
2965640	2970640	But then you get Mr. Peanut, who's the fanciest, richest nut of all time.
2970640	2973640	That's clearly just compensation.
2973640	2976640	There was a thing when I was at the...
2976640	2982640	We take our nuts very seriously at the Fisher Nut Company.
2982640	2984640	That was a commercial back then.
2984640	2988640	They were like, look, we know the word nuts means crazy and balls.
2988640	2989640	But buy ours.
2989640	2994640	They're clean and they're good for you and we're still...
2994640	2997640	We're not a bunch of crazy balls at the factory.
2997640	3000640	We're just putting nuts in a jar.
3000640	3002640	We're just putting nuts in your mouth.
3002640	3003640	Yeah.
3003640	3005640	All right.
3005640	3009640	I like it.
3009640	3012640	We're all going to come together at some point tonight.
3012640	3013640	All right.
3013640	3016640	We're all going to take a rape bath tonight and it's going to be fantastic.
3016640	3020640	But before we play D&D, who needs help in the audience tonight?
3020640	3022640	Is there anybody that needs help?
3022640	3024640	Your hands shut up immediately.
3024640	3027640	Did you come and sit in the front row because you really needed something tonight?
3027640	3028640	Yeah.
3028640	3030640	What's your name?
3030640	3031640	Sophie.
3031640	3032640	Sophie?
3032640	3034640	Do you want to come up and talk about the help that you need?
3034640	3036640	All right.
3036640	3039640	It's getting really easy.
3040640	3046640	I have to kind of do it Geraldo style where I control the mic because we've run out of mics.
3046640	3049640	Sophie, your name was, what's the problem?
3049640	3051640	I'm just this scholastic mess.
3051640	3053640	I don't know what to do in my life.
3053640	3054640	All right.
3054640	3057640	Well, so are you in college?
3057640	3058640	Yeah.
3058640	3061640	I really wanted to go to medical school and then I moved to Santa Barbara.
3061640	3064640	Somebody moved from medical school, by the way.
3064640	3065640	Let's note that.
3065640	3068640	You get a lot of partying down at medical school.
3068640	3074640	I really wanted to be a plastic surgeon and now I think I want to do sketch comedy.
3074640	3076640	Wow.
3076640	3080640	Two very, very noble fields in Hollywood.
3080640	3083640	We had the same thing last week.
3083640	3084640	That's weird.
3084640	3085640	One thing's for sure.
3085640	3087640	You definitely don't need to move to any other city.
3087640	3089640	No matter what you decide to do.
3089640	3094640	You could go back and forth between those two and you'll always be in the acropolis of both of them.
3095640	3099640	But at this point in time, are you like an undergrad at a college?
3099640	3101640	Could you combine the two?
3101640	3107640	Like, we need a nose and some sort of cleft palate.
3107640	3110640	A place, a cleft palate.
3110640	3113640	We'll make you smile.
3113640	3114640	All right.
3114640	3117640	Sophie, you're at a crossroads right now.
3117640	3121640	You're in what year of your college course?
3121640	3122640	What do you call it?
3122640	3126640	I would be a senior at UC Davis and then I left to go...
3126640	3127640	Thank you.
3127640	3130640	That's John Davis back there.
3130640	3136640	And then I left to go to Santa Barbara and maybe try this acting thing.
3136640	3137640	Wait.
3137640	3140640	I'm a terrible interviewer.
3140640	3144640	So if you were going to pursue acting, you would go to Santa Barbara?
3144640	3147640	Is that what you're saying?
3147640	3148640	This is why I'm a mess.
3148640	3151640	I'm taking chemistry and I'm also taking drama and singing.
3151640	3155640	I can smell your parents' stomach acid from here.
3159640	3164640	I was just going to say, I can smell the CW execs creaming their pants.
3164640	3169640	She's going to medical school, but she wants to be a model.
3169640	3174640	It's called medicineing Sophie.
3174640	3176640	Yeah, it's even worse.
3177640	3180640	Sophie, if you had your Sophie's choice...
3180640	3182640	Taken. Taken.
3182640	3184640	Who said that?
3184640	3190640	That was the non-gay best friend of an intermediate high five person.
3190640	3193640	If you had your dream, if you could do anything,
3193640	3196640	would you be a famous actress or comedian?
3196640	3202640	I'd want to do like SNL type stuff, but probably not that much more like YouTube kind of thing.
3202640	3207640	So your aim is to be on YouTube?
3207640	3210640	You could do that tonight.
3210640	3213640	Actually, you already are probably.
3213640	3215640	Somebody make a dream come true.
3215640	3216640	Dreams are coming true.
3216640	3219640	I want to be on Vine.
3219640	3220640	Now, I'm confused.
3220640	3224640	You want to get on SNL to break into YouTube?
3224640	3226640	Exactly.
3226640	3227640	It's a weird way around it.
3227640	3230640	Yeah, that's a big step down from SNL.
3230640	3232640	Sophie, what qualifies you to be on YouTube?
3232640	3234640	Oh, I see you went to medical school.
3234640	3235640	Very well.
3235640	3238640	Yeah, and you were on SNL for three years.
3238640	3239640	One more question.
3239640	3240640	One more question, Sophie.
3240640	3243640	Shower or bath?
3243640	3246640	Baths are for birds and babies, and I have neither.
3246640	3249640	Oh.
3249640	3250640	I am a baby.
3250640	3252640	I know which one Dan is, yeah.
3252640	3253640	All right.
3253640	3257640	Well, Sophie, is there a crossroads that we can identify and help you with, though?
3257640	3265640	You're saying, like, you're in your blank year of college, you're thinking,
3265640	3269640	I would like to reconstruct people's faces,
3269640	3272640	but I would also like to entertain people.
3272640	3274640	And there's a fork in the road.
3274640	3278640	So is there a, I mean, like, okay,
3278640	3280640	what's the next choice you're going to have to make
3280640	3282640	if you choose one or the other?
3282640	3284640	Medical school or not medical school.
3284640	3288640	Meaning that coming up, you're going to have to do what?
3288640	3290640	You're going to have to fill out an application for a medical school,
3290640	3295640	or that you're actually going to have to, like,
3295640	3297640	because I'm alien to the territory.
3297640	3298640	Okay.
3298640	3304640	So you need our help in deciding between a medical path and a performance path.
3304640	3305640	I have a diagnosis for you.
3305640	3307640	I think this is what is happening.
3307640	3308640	Can I say, I'm just going to get,
3308640	3311640	as someone who was also expected to become a doctor,
3311640	3313640	and now I am not a doctor, why are you laughing?
3314640	3316640	Just don't bully her.
3316640	3317640	No, no, no. I'm not bullying her.
3317640	3319640	What I'm saying is, this is what it seems to me is happening,
3319640	3323640	is that your parents had an expectation of you to be a doctor, perhaps,
3323640	3327640	or an expectation you put on yourself based on people you'd seen and whatever.
3327640	3331640	And so then you later decided that you really wanted to be an actor.
3331640	3336640	And for you, plastic surgery is sort of one step in the medical field
3336640	3338640	and one step in showbiz.
3338640	3340640	Or comedy.
3340640	3341640	Or comedy, yeah.
3342640	3346640	So you definitely want to be funny and entertain people.
3346640	3350640	That your passion is not for medicine.
3350640	3351640	It's not for medicine.
3351640	3352640	It's for mixed people.
3352640	3353640	Yeah.
3353640	3358640	You know, initially, I was thinking about the fat Patrick Adams.
3358640	3359640	Nicely played, young man.
3361640	3363640	Nicely played, young man.
3363640	3364640	I know he was there.
3364640	3366640	I was just talking to Mark.
3367640	3368640	Yeah, he was out there.
3368640	3370640	That's the amazing thing about Meltdown.
3370640	3373640	It's like Narnia.
3373640	3376640	Robin Williams could be looking at Watchmen.
3376640	3378640	Do you want to go do the show?
3378640	3379640	No, no, no.
3379640	3380640	I'm cool.
3380640	3381640	I'll stay here.
3384640	3387640	I want to find out what would happen if Batman grew up in the fiction.
3387640	3388640	I do.
3388640	3390640	I don't know.
3390640	3392640	You know, I was his best man.
3392640	3393640	Really?
3393640	3394640	What?
3394640	3395640	And I feel like such a heel that I do.
3395640	3397640	But I don't do manic Robin.
3397640	3398640	I do Robin.
3398640	3399640	No, you do it.
3399640	3400640	You were Robin Williams' best man.
3400640	3401640	Yeah.
3401640	3402640	Yes.
3402640	3403640	Wow.
3403640	3404640	On this latest model.
3406640	3407640	Is it still running, this model?
3407640	3408640	Oh, yeah, yeah.
3408640	3409640	The model is running.
3409640	3411640	It's a lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely woman.
3411640	3413640	But let's get back to...
3413640	3414640	Sophie.
3414640	3417640	My initial reaction was actually I got hostile.
3417640	3419640	Like, I was thinking about...
3419640	3420640	Do you know what I mean?
3420640	3422640	Like, the cliche of no one's ever said,
3422640	3424640	Quick, here's an emergency.
3424640	3426640	Is there a sketch comedian here?
3426640	3428640	Everybody got a real plastic surgeon.
3428640	3431640	But then I thought that I was being very hypocritical
3431640	3434640	because the advice I give to everybody often,
3434640	3437640	including my own daughter, is you've got to quit, man.
3437640	3439640	You've got to quit.
3439640	3441640	You've got to do that.
3441640	3442640	You know what's right.
3442640	3445640	You want to do this sketch, then you've got to do it.
3445640	3450640	And it may seem selfish, but it's actually really brave.
3450640	3451640	No one else...
3451640	3452640	No one's behind you right now.
3452640	3454640	No, no, they're agreed.
3454640	3456640	But it sounds...
3457640	3459640	But it's where your heart really is.
3459640	3460640	And in two weeks, you might say,
3460640	3462640	I made a big mistake and all this stuff,
3462640	3463640	and it's okay to keep quitting.
3463640	3466640	You keep quitting, and you keep quitting all through your life,
3466640	3470640	and eventually you end up someplace where you don't want to leave.
3470640	3471640	I mean...
3471640	3474640	All right, thank you, Sophie.
3474640	3481640	And I would rather sit in the front row of a show
3481640	3485640	and watch a person who might have been a doctor
3485640	3489640	do bad comedy than be under the knife of somebody that would really...
3489640	3492640	Just kind of...
3492640	3494640	I wish I was Sherry O'Tary,
3494640	3497640	but your cheekbones are...
3497640	3499640	Sit me down now.
3499640	3503640	The unspoken part of capitalism, the healthy part,
3503640	3506640	is the idea that because we have money
3506640	3509640	and because anything that you can do can generate money,
3509640	3512640	the idea is that unlike in monarchies,
3512640	3514640	anything that you want to do,
3514640	3516640	you can figure out a way to make money doing it.
3516640	3520640	The idea wasn't that your parents give you a bunch of money
3520640	3522640	and then they tell you what you're supposed to do,
3522640	3524640	and then you end up doing that even though you don't quite want to do it,
3524640	3527640	because that's what a poor person does and all this shit.
3527640	3530640	Like, the idea was supposed to be,
3530640	3534640	oh, it's capitalism, like, so fucking figure out a way.
3534640	3535640	Like, what's your passion?
3535640	3540640	I like cutting up roadkill and taking the little squirrel skulls
3540640	3545640	and gluing them to my forehead and just jumping up and down.
3545640	3549640	Well, you're the market corner on that.
3549640	3551640	There's got to be a way to make that worth something.
3551640	3554640	If there isn't, then you try as hard as you can,
3554640	3557640	and now that Kickstarter's here, there's...
3557640	3560640	But my heart first went to, like, wasn't even about bread.
3560640	3563640	I was thinking about how you help people, but...
3563640	3565640	High-roaded.
3565640	3567640	No, you went for...
3567640	3572640	But you went down to some, like, the genesis of some super villain
3572640	3577640	who's maiming people.
3577640	3582640	Mengele and the Riddler all got together.
3582640	3585640	But you really do have to be true to yourself.
3585640	3588640	You know, or you will be...
3588640	3591640	You know, I'm 50 and I rant in the valley
3591640	3594640	and I've never been happier in my life, you know?
3594640	3598640	Yeah, I mean, just, like, your career has been so interesting and so awesome.
3598640	3601640	You've had so many sort of different things you've done,
3601640	3604640	and nobody could have predicted, no offense,
3604640	3607640	watching you in Police Academy and been like,
3607640	3609640	someday it's going to be an awesome director
3609640	3611640	with a really good point of view
3611640	3613640	and, like, really, really, like, dark, awesome movies.
3613640	3615640	Nobody would have guessed that.
3615640	3617640	APPLAUSE
3617640	3619640	And what was the award that you just won?
3619640	3621640	You got some accolades for it.
3621640	3623640	Oh, it's nothing, whatever.
3623640	3625640	What is it?
3625640	3627640	Who reads Esquire? Whatever.
3627640	3629640	Director of the Year?
3629640	3630640	Yeah, but, you know, whatever.
3630640	3632640	There wasn't that many good movies this year.
3632640	3633640	Ah, come on.
3633640	3635640	It was an easy year.
3635640	3637640	APPLAUSE
3637640	3639640	Oh, yeah. I had lunch with Bob
3639640	3641640	and I was telling him, like, you know,
3641640	3643640	about the Charlie Kaufman thing we did on Kickstarter.
3643640	3645640	It was like, if there's ever been a director
3645640	3648640	that was, like, made, match made for a Kickstarter project,
3648640	3651640	like, if you showed up on that radar and said,
3651640	3654640	hey, anybody got ten bucks they want to...
3654640	3656640	Anybody interested in making this thing that I want to make?
3656640	3658640	Like, I bet you would make.
3658640	3661640	Like, everyone would immediately crowdfund you
3661640	3664640	because you've got this track record of, like,
3664640	3667640	obviously you only do exactly what you want to do
3667640	3669640	and that's all anyone wants to pay to see
3669640	3671640	is somebody that, you know, like,
3671640	3673640	Quentin Tarantino is within the studio system
3673640	3675640	but at least you're watching somebody that, like,
3675640	3677640	you're like, holy shit, like, I'm definitely watching
3677640	3679640	whatever Quentin Tarantino wanted to do
3679640	3681640	and not everybody gets to do that
3681640	3684640	and have major theatrical distribution, but...
3684640	3688640	I'm always trying to figure out his formula
3688640	3691640	of being creative and then...
3691640	3693640	And, yeah, and then...
3693640	3695640	But I'm not jealous. I'm more fascinated.
3695640	3697640	And obviously, like, everybody, I'm a huge fan
3697640	3700640	but I was thinking, so, we had a slave
3700640	3702640	burned down some plantation,
3702640	3705640	a ragtag team of Nazis kill Hitler.
3705640	3707640	I'm thinking the next is...
3707640	3710640	Somebody stops a plane from hitting a building.
3712640	3714640	I was gonna go with, like, a group of,
3714640	3717640	a scrappy group of altar boys kill the Pope.
3720640	3721640	He's pandering a little bit.
3721640	3723640	Yeah, yeah, or they make him retire.
3723640	3725640	We've got pictures, you know.
3725640	3726640	But, you know...
3726640	3729640	Bravo executives burned down a chick full of Anders.
3729640	3732640	And Oliver Stone literally did the fucking tower movie.
3732640	3734640	Like, Tarantino's obviously going,
3734640	3735640	well, I don't know, I'm not...
3735640	3737640	Like, what he's doing is, cinematically,
3737640	3739640	he's going, oh, these issues,
3739640	3742640	they overcharge, like, a hot rod engine
3742640	3744640	in a way that makes it go...
3744640	3747640	Yeah, like, it's like, who hates Nazis?
3747640	3748640	Who doesn't hate Nazis?
3748640	3750640	Nobody!
3750640	3753640	And it lets him go fucking crazy.
3753640	3755640	No, no, and it makes you...
3755640	3758640	It sounds silly, but he's not manipulating,
3758640	3760640	but you're super happy watching it.
3760640	3761640	I'm a huge fan.
3761640	3763640	When you said that, though, I was thinking,
3763640	3766640	like, Quentin Tarantino's Hogan's Heroes.
3766640	3769640	I would love to see that.
3769640	3771640	Hey, Bob, would you do us a big favor?
3771640	3772640	Double-edged sword, you came up here,
3772640	3774640	you soaked up your accolades,
3774640	3776640	big, funny Bob Hope cameo.
3776640	3778640	I did, it's kind of a cock.
3778640	3780640	My girlfriend's sick tonight, she's not here.
3780640	3783640	Could you play her part in Dungeons and Dragons?
3783640	3784640	Sure.
3784640	3785640	Okay.
3785640	3786640	All right, here you go.
3786640	3787640	All right.
3787640	3788640	Spencer, if you would,
3788640	3791640	dispense the character sheets.
3791640	3793640	You know how it works, Bob.
3793640	3796640	I watched, I have to say,
3796640	3798640	and I'm with an open mind,
3798640	3801640	but when I went to the homecoming show at the Egyptian,
3801640	3804640	when you did this part, I couldn't have been more lost.
3804640	3805640	Yeah.
3805640	3807640	Okay, that was a rat fuck.
3807640	3808640	Oh, okay.
3808640	3810640	Yeah, that was all over the kitchen, man.
3810640	3812640	Okay, well, I'll try my best.
3812640	3815640	I don't think anybody's calling that a...
3815640	3817640	Basically, these character sheets,
3817640	3820640	I tend to stare at them with my eyeballs,
3820640	3822640	but I'm not actually reading anything on them.
3822640	3824640	I'm just nervous.
3825640	3826640	Yeah, this is gonna...
3826640	3827640	Thank you, sir.
3827640	3829640	I just did this for the first time last week,
3829640	3830640	and it didn't make any sense to me,
3830640	3831640	so just sort of go with it.
3831640	3833640	The idea is Spencer's the narrator.
3833640	3835640	He tells you what's going on,
3835640	3837640	and he's the final judge of everything that happens,
3837640	3838640	and he has dice,
3838640	3842640	and he has an encyclopedic knowledge of rules to guide him,
3842640	3845640	but you tell him on a turn-by-turn basis
3845640	3847640	what it is you want to do.
3847640	3850640	And he'll tell you whether or not that's available to you,
3850640	3852640	and if it's something hard for you to do,
3852640	3853640	he'll roll the dice,
3853640	3855640	and you'll find out the outcome of that.
3855640	3856640	Is that correct, Spencer?
3856640	3857640	That's correct.
3857640	3858640	All right.
3858640	3860640	And your character kind of has arrows
3860640	3862640	and shoots a lot of arrows.
3862640	3865640	Last week, she fucked Dan under a horse.
3865640	3866640	Oh, that's right.
3866640	3869640	Also, she used to be a dude.
3870640	3872640	You're in love with me.
3872640	3873640	You're in love with Dan.
3873640	3874640	You used to be a dude.
3874640	3876640	You fucked him under a horse.
3876640	3877640	Yeah, you shoot arrows.
3877640	3880640	Spencer, if you would, get us up to date.
3882640	3884640	Uh, last time.
3884640	3886640	Our heroes had split up.
3886640	3887640	Sharpie and Mulrain,
3887640	3889640	possessed with compassionate spirits,
3889640	3891640	charged off on Coco, the animal companion,
3891640	3893640	along the length of the infina fish,
3893640	3895640	in the hopes, this is a run-on sentence,
3895640	3898640	of finding the fish-dwelling tribe of humans
3898640	3900640	and a halfling in the wreckage of the fish.
3900640	3903640	But the pair didn't realize the truly infinite nature
3903640	3906640	of the infina fish and soon retired.
3906640	3909640	Gripped by passion and a sense of daring heroism,
3909640	3912640	the couple copulated in the shade of their great horse.
3914640	3916640	Meanwhile, Quark ran into a progress
3916640	3918640	blocking thicket in the forest,
3918640	3920640	a massive wall of trees,
3920640	3923640	believing traps to be about he stood stock still,
3923640	3926640	allowing him to hear the approach of yet another stranger.
3926640	3929640	Christaberg, the songsman.
3929640	3931640	The two caught up on recent happenings
3931640	3934640	and bounced ideas for song titles off each other for a time.
3934640	3937640	Yeah, Bobcat Christaberg, you know, Lady in Red.
3937640	3938640	He sang Lady in Red.
3938640	3939640	Yeah.
3939640	3940640	That's his character.
3940640	3941640	He also wrote it.
3944640	3945640	Great song.
3945640	3946640	It's a good jam.
3946640	3947640	Yeah, it's great.
3947640	3948640	He's also a thief.
3950640	3951640	Uh, yeah.
3951640	3952640	He also is a thief.
3952640	3953640	That's so true.
3953640	3954640	Thirty seconds, Professor.
3954640	3955640	I know.
3955640	3957640	I just, maybe I'm filling.
3957640	3959640	Uh, rejoined by Sharpie and Mulrain,
3959640	3962640	who, bathing in the afterglow, decided that the fish-dwelling folk
3962640	3964640	of the infinite fish were probably fine
3964640	3966640	and charged swiftly towards the exact location.
3966640	3968640	The party set off following Christaberg,
3968640	3971640	their newfound guide toward the soul of growth.
3971640	3972640	He did it again!
3972640	3973640	Perfect challenge.
3974640	3976640	How do you do it, Spencer?
3977640	3978640	So, you're caught up, right?
3978640	3979640	That all made sense?
3979640	3981640	Oh, yeah. Now I understand.
3982640	3986640	Yeah, so, we're going after a thing called the soul of growth.
3986640	3987640	Yeah.
3987640	3991640	And I'm following my newfound possibly friend, Christaberg.
3991640	3993640	Hopefully friend, yeah.
3993640	3996640	Singer-songwriter of The Lady in Red.
3996640	3997640	Great song.
3997640	3998640	You've heard that song, right?
3998640	4001640	He's good with a bow and a dagger as well.
4001640	4002640	A bow and a dagger.
4002640	4003640	Yeah.
4003640	4004640	That's good to know.
4004640	4008640	And he keeps trying to go back to the well of writing songs
4008640	4012640	about women in various shades of clothing.
4012640	4013640	Women in white.
4014640	4015640	Women in beige.
4016640	4019640	Yeah, I think there was a dude in scarlet was one of them.
4020640	4023640	I feel like they haven't really hit as hard as Lady in Red.
4023640	4025640	We're all together now? We've all caught up?
4025640	4027640	You're all together following Christaberg
4027640	4029640	to the rumored location of the soul of growth.
4029640	4031640	I examine the immediate surroundings.
4031640	4034640	As you walk, you notice the purple tinge of the sky
4034640	4036640	beginning to ripple and change.
4036640	4039640	The floating, light-giving orbs of this plane
4039640	4041640	ceased shedding their brilliant light
4041640	4044640	and one by one began winking out of existence.
4046640	4047640	So it's nighttime?
4047640	4051640	The sky changes to deep red
4051640	4053640	and the shadows grow deep.
4053640	4057640	I just realized there's a fine line between Spencer and Prince.
4059640	4061640	Is there about to be a raspberry dawn?
4062640	4066640	The sky is purple, there are people running everywhere.
4066640	4068640	I only want to see you.
4068640	4070640	He's a good songwriter. You should be flattered.
4070640	4072640	What? Oh.
4073640	4075640	I wanted to ask a question
4075640	4077640	because I was listening to the last couple episodes
4077640	4079640	and realized that during the various blackout drunks
4079640	4082640	that occur at this segment in the show
4082640	4086640	that I acquired a book of fiery writing, right?
4086640	4088640	It's a book of bloody writing.
4088640	4091640	Anything you want to tell me about that?
4092640	4096640	Is it me, the disembodied voice that describes your surroundings?
4096640	4098640	Wait, what? Sorry?
4098640	4099640	Just say yes.
4099640	4102640	Oh yes, yes, yes, you, the gods.
4102640	4103640	Yes.
4103640	4105640	You found a book. You believed it to be magic.
4105640	4109640	It's similar to your spell book, but also different.
4109640	4112640	Radiate strong power, I think you noticed at one point
4112640	4114640	and you wanted it.
4114640	4116640	It's probably some sort of artifact.
4116640	4118640	You couldn't read the language.
4118640	4120640	Do I think it's a spell book?
4120640	4123640	You think it's some form of spell book or maybe...
4123640	4125640	And I could read it and cast the spells from it if it was.
4125640	4127640	If you could read it.
4127640	4129640	Can I read it?
4130640	4131640	Potentially.
4131640	4135640	He can read music. Can Christoperg read this book?
4135640	4138640	You guys have to act it out. You're just talking to me.
4138640	4141640	I hold the book up to my companions.
4141640	4144640	And I go, anybody ever see this language?
4144640	4146640	Look with your eyes, not with your hands.
4146640	4150640	That's clearly a duck.
4151640	4153640	I speak gnome, common, and dwarf.
4153640	4155640	That doesn't seem to be what I can speak.
4155640	4157640	Nope.
4157640	4159640	Yeah, I can read it.
4160640	4161640	I can read it.
4161640	4163640	You definitely recognize it.
4163640	4167640	Christoperg, you're not just a songwriter.
4167640	4170640	You're a bloody book reader.
4170640	4172640	It's so ironic that you could read this book,
4172640	4176640	but you couldn't read the pulse of the people
4176640	4178640	after your first hit song.
4178640	4181640	I think I read it pretty well, at least once.
4182640	4186640	Are you saying you can read the writing in red?
4186640	4187640	It's all blood.
4187640	4191640	As long as it's red colored, I'm the king of it.
4191640	4194640	Christoperg, what does this book say? I hand it to him.
4194640	4197640	It's just the lyrics to my song.
4198640	4200640	No, turn the page.
4200640	4202640	Oh, sorry.
4202640	4206640	You recognize them to be magic words, but not being a wizard.
4206640	4208640	You can't really glean their true meaning.
4209640	4212640	They're magic words, but I'm not really a wizard.
4212640	4214640	What language?
4214640	4216640	Magicese.
4216640	4220640	I'm going to say it's a far realms language.
4220640	4224640	It's Urdu, the language we speak in Pakistan.
4224640	4226640	That's fine.
4226640	4228640	You shake your head in his ass.
4228640	4230640	I shook my head.
4230640	4232640	You don't know there's not Pakistan?
4232640	4234640	I don't know how to read it.
4234640	4236640	I don't know how to read it.
4237640	4239640	It would say abracadabra.
4239640	4241640	You could read it.
4241640	4244640	I can read it phonetically.
4244640	4246640	You just don't get magic.
4246640	4250640	If he said the words out loud, would the spells still work?
4250640	4253640	No. You have to weave the spell.
4253640	4255640	Give me that book back.
4255640	4258640	If you're a magician, if you're a wizard,
4258640	4261640	I can read the words and then you can repeat them
4261640	4263640	and then make the magic happen.
4263640	4265640	Is that true?
4265640	4270640	You guys study together like studying partners
4270640	4272640	and work through the book
4272640	4275640	and then you could learn the secrets with them potentially.
4275640	4278640	I'll show you what the words are and then you can...
4278640	4280640	I'll give you the book back.
4280640	4287640	I've begun to assemble a study group of unlikely misfits,
4287640	4293640	including a Middle Eastern savant
4293640	4296640	who's obsessed with pop culture.
4296640	4298640	You pulled back the curtain.
4298640	4302640	It sounds a little derivative.
4302640	4304640	Yeah, breakfast is comfortable.
4304640	4306640	I like it.
4306640	4308640	While they form a study group,
4308640	4311640	I take Coco the horse and lead it off in the woods and fuck it.
4313640	4316640	That's fine. That could happen.
4316640	4318640	It's pretty sensual.
4318640	4320640	You fuck Aaron's horse?
4320640	4322640	Why not? She's not here.
4323640	4326640	You need a stool to get up to the right height.
4326640	4328640	Are you letting it...
4328640	4330640	You can do a handstand.
4332640	4335640	I take my sword and chop down a tree
4335640	4337640	and form a stump just high enough for me to stand on
4337640	4339640	and fuck Aaron's horse in the ass.
4339640	4340640	Well, let's see here.
4340640	4343640	There's actually that staff, the staff with the button on it.
4343640	4347640	I can't find my horse.
4348640	4351640	Oh, it's okay. I'm sure nobody's fucking it.
4351640	4356640	I'm going to go walk around and see if I can find my horse.
4356640	4358640	Coco?
4359640	4362640	You hear the sounds of grunting and neighing.
4364640	4366640	Coco.
4366640	4367640	What are you...
4367640	4369640	Oh, oh, oh, my God, oh, my God.
4369640	4371640	It's not what it looks like.
4371640	4373640	It kind of looks like he chopped down a tree
4373640	4376640	to get tall enough to fuck the horse.
4377640	4380640	All right, that is exactly what it looks like.
4380640	4385640	I am keenly acknowledgeable about nature
4385640	4389640	and I am upset that you did this to a tree.
4393640	4396640	G and G master, Bob Goldwite.
4396640	4398640	Yeah. The horse is a fuck horse.
4398640	4400640	Everybody's fucked up.
4400640	4401640	Yeah.
4401640	4403640	You could fuck it. You could fuck under it.
4403640	4405640	It's a fuck horse.
4405640	4408640	If you can imagine it, it can do it.
4408640	4409640	All right.
4409640	4412640	Me and the horse take a post-coital nap
4412640	4417640	and time passes and hopefully Sharpie and Christa Berg
4417640	4420640	have decoded the book at this point.
4420640	4422640	Well, it is a long book.
4422640	4424640	I will say that you've decoded a couple pages
4424640	4427640	and might be able to cast off a spell or two.
4427640	4430640	All right. I fuck the horse again, take another nap.
4431640	4433640	Well, that would be fine.
4433640	4437640	As night had fallen before you guys cut me off,
4437640	4440640	you hear the low moaning all around you
4440640	4442640	of some approaching horse.
4442640	4444640	Of a horse? Sorry, sorry.
4444640	4447640	Of a horse in the throes of orgasm.
4448640	4452640	No, several low moans all around you,
4452640	4456640	far away, pretty far away.
4456640	4459640	I hear some horse moaning.
4459640	4460640	I hear more.
4460640	4462640	It's not Coco.
4463640	4464640	I hear it.
4464640	4467640	Do you know how you make a horse moan?
4467640	4469640	You chop down a tree.
4475640	4480640	Can we, Sharpie and Christa Berg,
4480640	4485640	hey, I think you're ready to try a spell against these guys.
4485640	4486640	Well, hold on.
4486640	4488640	We don't know these guys.
4488640	4490640	Hold on, Christa Berg.
4490640	4495640	I want to send Avenger up to get a literal bird's eye view.
4495640	4497640	Avenger is a hawk.
4497640	4500640	Hawk, for those of you first time podcast listeners.
4500640	4502640	By my head.
4503640	4508640	Avenger, fly and seek.
4510640	4513640	Launching from your arm, Avenger takes to the air.
4513640	4516640	Soon he's past the canopy of thick trees.
4517640	4518640	That's me.
4518640	4522640	That's my hawk way of saying, keep doing what you're doing.
4522640	4524640	You assume he's circling around,
4524640	4527640	getting the lay of the land, and soon he returns.
4529640	4532640	Avenger, what see you?
4532640	4535640	It's pretty tough to see through a forest, but...
4535640	4539640	Avenger, please tone down the sarcasm.
4541640	4543640	Dude, your hawk's got a lot of attitude.
4543640	4545640	You have learned much as a bird,
4545640	4548640	but sarcasm remains a human domain.
4548640	4549640	I'm not.
4549640	4552640	Yours is but to spy and report.
4552640	4555640	Still talking.
4555640	4560640	But I managed to see at least 20
4560640	4563640	what looked to be gray humans approaching.
4563640	4565640	Jesus Christ, we got to get the fuck out of here.
4565640	4568640	I've never been more cowardly.
4568640	4569640	There are 20...
4569640	4573640	I relate this information to the writer of Lady in Red.
4573640	4575640	I have an idea for a new song.
4575640	4577640	Men in gray.
4577640	4581640	Jesus Christ, you got to fucking let go, man.
4581640	4584640	It just comes to me, you know?
4584640	4586640	Nothing comes to you, man.
4586640	4588640	Name a color or a hung up.
4588640	4589640	Name a color.
4591640	4592640	Name a color?
4592640	4593640	Just name a color.
4593640	4594640	No more.
4594640	4597640	Everything doesn't have to be a color or a person wearing a color.
4597640	4599640	It's such a good song.
4599640	4602640	You can write a song called Sing in the Rain.
4602640	4603640	You're not writing.
4603640	4605640	You're just changing a word.
4605640	4606640	It's a mad lib.
4606640	4609640	Sometimes I change up to two words.
4611640	4613640	Because it's, you know, there was Lady in Red.
4613640	4614640	Snap out of it!
4614640	4617640	There's an army of 20 gray people coming.
4617640	4619640	I assume they're orchards.
4619640	4620640	Orchards, golems.
4620640	4623640	Orchards is approaching us.
4623640	4624640	Are there animals?
4624640	4626640	Are there woodland animals around?
4626640	4627640	You don't hear them.
4627640	4631640	It seems that they've been quiet ever since that moaning started.
4631640	4633640	I take out one of my sacks of nuts,
4633640	4636640	and I tempt woodland creatures toward me.
4636640	4637640	Jesus.
4637640	4640640	After a time, the squirrel approaches.
4640640	4642640	A squirrel approaches!
4642640	4645640	What is your deal?
4645640	4648640	What are you looking to do next?
4648640	4651640	You've already fucked a horse twice.
4653640	4654640	Give me the nut.
4654640	4655640	I'm in a hurry.
4655640	4656640	What's up?
4656640	4657640	Hey.
4657640	4658640	Hey, hello squirrel.
4658640	4660640	That squirrel is carrying a Brazil nut.
4660640	4661640	Hey.
4661640	4664640	You know what they call these on this plane?
4664640	4665640	Squirrel.
4665640	4666640	Look.
4666640	4667640	Orch toes.
4667640	4668640	Orch toes.
4668640	4670640	I don't want to talk to racist squirrels.
4670640	4671640	Hey.
4671640	4672640	Can I have that nut?
4672640	4673640	Yes, you can.
4673640	4674640	On one condition.
4674640	4675640	On one condition, squirrel.
4675640	4677640	I'll give you the whole sack of nuts.
4677640	4678640	Hey.
4678640	4681640	If you'll scamper forth and examine this army
4681640	4683640	and find out if their friends are foes.
4683640	4684640	I'm not doing that.
4684640	4685640	Those are fucking zombies.
4685640	4686640	Oh shit.
4686640	4687640	Oh, he's answered the question.
4687640	4688640	All right.
4688640	4689640	I fucked a squirrel.
4689640	4696640	He's in no use to me now.
4696640	4700640	I'm still not convinced these are bad zombies.
4701640	4702640	All right.
4702640	4704640	What do we know about zombies in the D&D world?
4704640	4707640	They're not like, like Walking Dead just came out.
4707640	4708640	It's not why.
4708640	4712640	But in the magic of the D&D, if you hit them in the head,
4712640	4713640	they don't die.
4713640	4714640	They're stitched together by magic.
4714640	4717640	So they'll, they'll keep fighting.
4717640	4719640	So we're going to need the spells that Krista Berg
4719640	4723640	and Sharpie have, you know, put together, right?
4723640	4724640	Potentially.
4724640	4727640	I have a question.
4727640	4732640	I don't know very much about, do I look in my,
4732640	4733640	I have a sack or something, right?
4733640	4734640	Probably.
4734640	4736640	You have knowledge of various subjects.
4736640	4737640	Okay.
4737640	4740640	So I know, dude, I know these zombie guys.
4740640	4741640	Right.
4741640	4743640	You know, you know a thing or two about zombies.
4743640	4744640	Are they slow?
4744640	4745640	Are they slower than us?
4745640	4747640	They're not particularly fast.
4747640	4749640	They're not super fast, but they're like a glacier.
4749640	4752640	Like if it comes for you, you're fucked like Coco.
4754640	4755640	Bad pitch.
4755640	4758640	Walk in the opposite direction.
4758640	4760640	I mean, we weren't going anywhere anyway.
4760640	4761640	How many zombies?
4761640	4762640	Twenty.
4762640	4764640	Twenty that Avenger claims to have seen.
4764640	4766640	But, you know, through a forest.
4766640	4767640	That's pretty.
4767640	4770640	There is also only as high as Avenger can count.
4770640	4771640	Are they?
4771640	4772640	Hey.
4772640	4773640	Are they between us?
4774640	4777640	There are twenty stars in the sky.
4777640	4779640	Always, yeah.
4779640	4782640	Are they between us and the soul of growth?
4782640	4785640	You don't have a beat of their exact direction.
4785640	4787640	They're in various directions.
4787640	4790640	Now, I get to cast one spell a day.
4790640	4791640	Oh, yeah.
4791640	4794640	But is it limited by, what is it limited by?
4794640	4795640	I think you know two spells.
4795640	4797640	Were there two spells listed on that sheet?
4797640	4800640	They should have been on the page behind that,
4800640	4801640	on the right sidebar.
4801640	4802640	No.
4802640	4805640	I left my other sheet in the other part of the forest, I think.
4805640	4806640	No.
4806640	4807640	What's my two spells?
4807640	4809640	I think you can talk to plants.
4809640	4810640	Oh, yeah.
4810640	4811640	There's a...
4811640	4812640	Summer in nature's alley.
4812640	4813640	Oh, yeah.
4813640	4814640	You could summer...
4814640	4815640	Ally.
4815640	4816640	Ally.
4816640	4818640	Nature's alley was a sitcom.
4818640	4819640	That's cake now.
4819640	4821640	And you can entangle.
4821640	4822640	Hmm.
4822640	4823640	Ooh.
4823640	4824640	So you can make the forest and tangle them?
4824640	4825640	Yeah.
4825640	4826640	Yeah.
4826640	4829640	Well, guys, before I entangle these zombies,
4829640	4835640	this is something I need from all of you.
4835640	4841640	One of you needs to stop fucking my horse.
4841640	4842640	No names.
4842640	4843640	I don't think...
4843640	4847640	I'm currently fucking a squirrel over here.
4847640	4853640	I should mention you critical failed that squirrel fucker.
4853640	4855640	So you've sprained your penis.
4855640	4858640	The story of my life, Spencer.
4858640	4861640	Please don't go squirrel.
4861640	4867640	And before I entangled these zombies in vines and leaves, I also...
4867640	4872640	I need someone to give me Avenger as a pet.
4872640	4874640	What?
4874640	4875640	You heard me.
4875640	4876640	Baby?
4876640	4877640	I don't understand.
4877640	4879640	You already have a horse.
4879640	4880640	I know.
4880640	4881640	Not even a virgin horse.
4881640	4882640	But the horse is sullied.
4882640	4883640	I don't.
4883640	4887640	I'm surprised she hasn't already shot two arrows at Avenger.
4887640	4889640	We're lovers.
4889640	4890640	I know.
4890640	4892640	But I don't trust where this is going.
4892640	4895640	And I think I'm more nurturing.
4895640	4896640	This is for Avenger.
4896640	4900640	It's not about you.
4900640	4909640	I have to give up my hawk in exchange for a tangle spell that may or may not prevent zombies from...
4909640	4912640	Well, your friends have been fucking all the other animals.
4912640	4914640	Listen, my hawk is the reason we know this.
4914640	4915640	I don't need a hero to help me.
4915640	4916640	I'm sorry.
4916640	4920640	I need you to stop writing songs about colors is what I need from you.
4920640	4921640	All right.
4921640	4922640	I got a new one.
4922640	4926640	Cork in a horse.
4926640	4927640	That's good.
4927640	4928640	No colors in that one.
4928640	4930640	Is dancing with me.
4930640	4932640	It's still too close.
4932640	4935640	Do I know what kind of spell in that...
4935640	4938640	Will Christopher help me decipher that tone?
4938640	4939640	Do I know what kind of spell I'd be casting?
4939640	4943640	Do you remember that spell that you cast to try and find your father where you cut yourself?
4943640	4944640	Yeah.
4944640	4945640	My blood magic spell.
4945640	4948640	That's the spell that was the first spell that you learned.
4948640	4949640	So you could find something.
4949640	4951640	Find father?
4951640	4952640	I mean, potentially.
4952640	4953640	Wait.
4953640	4954640	Don't already do it.
4954640	4955640	We don't need your dad.
4955640	4956640	I'm not.
4956640	4957640	It's pointless.
4957640	4958640	It's a dumb spell.
4958640	4960640	It brings your dad around?
4960640	4961640	Yeah.
4961640	4965640	It creates emotional arc.
4965640	4968640	Or it just bums you out.
4968640	4973640	I like the idea that Morang could summon the forest to entangle these zombies.
4973640	4974640	All right.
4974640	4976640	That's fine, but I'm not giving her my hawk.
4976640	4978640	Is there anything I can do...
4978640	4979640	It's ridiculous that she's...
4979640	4980640	How about...
4980640	4983640	Well, I have stuff.
4983640	4986640	All right, fine.
4986640	4991640	Knowing that my girlfriend is in a phase right now,
4991640	4994640	and that she'll probably give the hawk back later, I give it to her.
4994640	4995640	All right.
4995640	5002640	And I wink at Avenger in a way that goes, women.
5002640	5009640	I wink at Avenger in a way that says, I'm going to fuck you later.
5009640	5012640	This is why you learned to speak to animals.
5012640	5015640	Now, Christopher DeBarge.
5015640	5017640	It's Chris DeBarge.
5017640	5019640	Is it El DeBarge?
5019640	5022640	I did say DeBarge.
5022640	5026640	Miss a little, miss a lot.
5026640	5029640	I really am going to ask you to...
5029640	5032640	No more songwriting at all.
5032640	5034640	You're just going to have to give up the skill.
5034640	5036640	You have no power over me.
5036640	5037640	No, I don't.
5037640	5040640	But if you want me to use my power to make the...
5040640	5042640	You're so needy right now.
5042640	5043640	You took the hawk.
5043640	5047640	You're taking the one thing I'm good at?
5047640	5050640	Writing songs about people in various colors of clothing?
5050640	5052640	He's trying to help you write better songs.
5052640	5054640	You're stuck in a rut right now, Christopher.
5054640	5055640	All right.
5056640	5058640	All right, I'll just let it go.
5058640	5059640	I won't...
5059640	5061640	The zombies are getting closer.
5061640	5066640	I won't write a new song for like a little while.
5066640	5067640	All right.
5067640	5072640	Now I'm going to summon all the trees, the vines, and shrubs
5072640	5080640	to entangle the army of 20 zombies.
5080640	5082640	Avenger's really bad with math.
5082640	5083640	At least 20.
5083640	5084640	At least 20.
5084640	5086640	To be stopped.
5086640	5091640	Touching the trees around you, they begin to contort and twist into life.
5091640	5099640	They wrap and wave in anger and combat and stuff.
5099640	5105640	I'm determining whether it's working.
5105640	5106640	What are you...
5106640	5107640	Droopy dog.
5107640	5108640	Hello, Joe.
5108640	5111640	Is this working?
5111640	5114640	I'm determining if it's working.
5114640	5118640	Sounds like Mom just told you a basketball practice was happening.
5118640	5120640	Because I'm breaking the illusion.
5120640	5122640	That's no fun.
5122640	5126640	You manage to entangle much of the zombies.
5126640	5129640	You feel them being held fast.
5129640	5133640	And by feel, I mean assume is happening.
5133640	5135640	How do you like me now, zombies?
5135640	5136640	They're still pretty far off.
5136640	5138640	They can't hear you if you say that.
5138640	5139640	Can I ask you a sidebar question?
5140640	5143640	I have a levitate spell.
5143640	5145640	How high will that take me up?
5145640	5149640	Whatever you designate will float slowly.
5149640	5151640	I think it's like 20 feet per round.
5151640	5153640	And then once I'm up there...
5153640	5155640	Here's the bottom line.
5155640	5157640	I'm sharing this with you.
5157640	5160640	I want to become a living gun turret.
5160640	5162640	Where I'm up in the air and I'm going,
5162640	5164640	MOTHERFUCKER!
5164640	5167640	And magic missling zombies.
5168640	5170640	Like a sniper tower.
5170640	5173640	You have to concentrate to hold levitation.
5173640	5175640	You could attempt it,
5175640	5178640	but you have a chance of failing the spell
5178640	5180640	or falling out of the sky.
5180640	5182640	I feel like there's really something in this book
5182640	5184640	that's going to help us here.
5184640	5186640	No, it'll find my dad. It's gay.
5186640	5190640	Or maybe the first spell isn't the best one.
5190640	5192640	There's more spells.
5192640	5194640	You just focus.
5194640	5196640	There aren't spells?
5196640	5198640	What?
5198640	5201640	You're reading a book and zombies happen.
5201640	5203640	That's not on me.
5203640	5206640	Wait, we made the zombies happen?
5206640	5208640	No, that happened.
5208640	5210640	Someone's yelling at us from the forest.
5210640	5213640	Sounds like somebody's dad showed up anyways.
5213640	5215640	Guys, use the second spell!
5215640	5217640	There's a second spell.
5217640	5219640	What's the second spell?
5219640	5220640	It's called...
5220640	5221640	Kill zombies.
5221640	5223640	No, it's called Blood Blade.
5224640	5227640	It's a blade of blood, potentially.
5227640	5229640	It's the ability of what?
5229640	5231640	It's a blade of blood, potentially.
5231640	5232640	What does that mean?
5232640	5233640	You don't know.
5233640	5237640	We're going to try to use this blade of blood.
5237640	5238640	It's red.
5238640	5241640	I'll handle this.
5241640	5244640	Not to write a song about it.
5244640	5248640	Dude, red things are like my wheelhouse.
5248640	5250640	I got this.
5250640	5253640	Christopher, can you sing a song about zombies in red
5253640	5258640	that are so boring that it kills all the zombies?
5258640	5261640	Can he cast boring song on people?
5261640	5263640	You know, I should have made you a fucking bard
5263640	5266640	because they can do that, but you're a rogue.
5266640	5267640	Oh, no.
5267640	5269640	I cast Blade of Blood with Christopher.
5269640	5271640	I'm sort of like Sophie in that I'm a thief,
5271640	5273640	but I really want to be a singer.
5276640	5278640	Well, zombies are fucking zombies.
5278640	5279640	That wouldn't make sense.
5279640	5283640	So do we know what the blood sword spell is?
5283640	5285640	I have an idea.
5285640	5290640	You get the idea that it could like slice something,
5290640	5292640	perhaps a foe or enemy.
5292640	5296640	Could it give a zombie back its soul?
5296640	5297640	Maybe.
5297640	5299640	You don't know that it can't?
5299640	5300640	Can I...
5300640	5302640	Because then they would suddenly be burdened
5302640	5304640	with humanity again.
5304640	5306640	And it would be terrible.
5306640	5307640	What are we doing?
5307640	5309640	They'd be like, what the fuck are we doing?
5309640	5310640	Wait a minute.
5310640	5311640	Good Will Hunting wasn't good.
5311640	5314640	All right, Spencer.
5314640	5318640	It's just the font was fancy.
5318640	5319640	I'm not.
5319640	5320640	Can I...
5320640	5324640	If you called that movie Guys Hanging Out, I'd hate it.
5324640	5326640	I start performing my lute in hopes that
5326640	5330640	Christopher sings a song that charms the zombies.
5330640	5335640	I could throw my platinum record at him.
5335640	5336640	One of them.
5336640	5337640	Records don't exist, man.
5337640	5339640	There's wax cylinders.
5339640	5341640	Are you guys taking this seriously?
5341640	5343640	Let's cast the blood blade spell.
5343640	5344640	Let's do it together.
5344640	5345640	All right, let's do it.
5345640	5347640	I'll go and I'm going to chop all their heads off.
5347640	5349640	I'm sure that still works in D&D world.
5349640	5350640	Can I say one thing?
5350640	5352640	Don't chop off the ones that are already entangled.
5352640	5354640	Do the ones that are free and coming at us.
5354640	5355640	Good idea.
5355640	5358640	As it happens, three breakthrough of the undergrowth.
5358640	5363640	The ones that just broke through, definitely get those.
5363640	5364640	They seem intent.
5364640	5368640	How, how, how, how, how?
5368640	5369640	How, how, how.
5369640	5372640	Blood blade, blood blade.
5372640	5374640	Going to the mall.
5374640	5377640	Going to be going to do it.
5377640	5380640	I'm going to make a blade out of the.
5384640	5387640	You want to bit on the neck and bite a zombie.
5387640	5388640	What?
5388640	5389640	What, what?
5389640	5390640	crossed.
5390640	5392640	While you're casting your incantation,
5392640	5394640	one of the zombies manages to bite you in the arms.
5394640	5396640	You have four damage.
5396640	5397640	Oh dude.
5397640	5399640	After that happens, your cell goes off.
5399640	5402640	Say, aren't you glad you weren't holding Avenger now?
5402640	5404640	I, I climb a tree.
5404640	5407640	I use my climb ability to climb the tallest tree around us.
5407640	5408640	That happens.
5408640	5411640	And then, using my far sword,
5411640	5416640	I spin around with one hand like Gene Kelly in a lamp post.
5416640	5418640	And I swing around using my far sword attack.
5418640	5420640	I swing around and aim at all the zombies
5420640	5422640	and try to get one far sword sweep
5422640	5425640	and kill as many zombies as I can.
5425640	5428640	As the spell blood blade goes off,
5428640	5431640	your far sword does as well.
5431640	5436640	A blade of air and a blade of blood fly through the area.
5436640	5439640	Hey, you should have told us to duck you motherfucker.
5439640	5440640	Yeah.
5440640	5441640	You guys are cool.
5441640	5442640	I wasn't aiming at you guys.
5442640	5444640	But we couldn't even see it.
5444640	5446640	It's a blade of air bro.
5446640	5450640	Dealing 13 and 16 damage to two of the zombies,
5450640	5451640	slicing them into pieces.
5451640	5452640	Yeah.
5452640	5453640	I just kill two zombies.
5453640	5454640	Everyone take it easy.
5454640	5455640	You both kill two zombies.
5455640	5459640	I climb down from the tree and fuck one of the dead zombies.
5459640	5460640	Jesus Christ, this guy.
5460640	5464640	I fucking, I gotta, I'm hard as a diamond dragon.
5464640	5467640	This is an HBO original campaign?
5467640	5471640	Don't you ever spoon?
5471640	5473640	Yeah, what's your refractory period?
5473640	5474640	Yeah, I'm a barbarian.
5474640	5475640	Zero turns?
5475640	5476640	I'm a barbarian.
5476640	5478640	Hey, what happened to cuddling?
5478640	5480640	You guys are talking like people that want to get fucked.
5480640	5481640	I'll tell you that one.
5481640	5482640	All right.
5482640	5483640	All right, all right.
5483640	5485640	Hey, I have a bow and arrow, right?
5485640	5486640	Yeah, yeah, you do.
5486640	5489640	Can I shoot a bow and arrow at one of the zombies?
5489640	5490640	Yeah, definitely.
5490640	5492640	Don't just shoot the arrow.
5492640	5493640	What do you mean?
5493640	5494640	Don't shoot the bow.
5494640	5495640	Use the bow to shoot the arrow.
5495640	5497640	Only shoot the bow after you're all out of arrows.
5497640	5499640	I think I got the last thing I did.
5499640	5500640	Bow.
5500640	5502640	I have a hundred bows in one arrow.
5502640	5506640	So I'm pretty sure I know how this works.
5506640	5509640	Make whatever you do with that bow count.
5509640	5511640	All right, so I shoot an arrow at a guy.
5511640	5515640	Your arrow plunges into the neck of one of the remaining zombies.
5515640	5517640	It takes seven damage.
5517640	5518640	How many are left?
5518640	5520640	That zombie is left.
5520640	5521640	The rest are entangled at the moment.
5521640	5522640	So it didn't die?
5522640	5524640	It didn't quite die.
5524640	5526640	Oh, fuck, guys.
5526640	5530640	Maybe you should sing to it.
5531640	5535640	Summon monster two.
5535640	5536640	Oh, shit.
5536640	5538640	What monster do you want to summon?
5538640	5544640	The one that can cause the most damage to the most targets that are entangled in the most amount of most.
5544640	5545640	Squid.
5545640	5546640	Squid.
5546640	5547640	No, not squid.
5547640	5550640	That's literally the most wrong answer.
5550640	5552640	Yeah, no, not squid.
5552640	5554640	I summon an ape.
5554640	5555640	I'm so sorry.
5555640	5556640	Who's yelling at us, guys?
5556640	5557640	Everyone.
5557640	5558640	Life.
5558640	5561640	I'm telling you, whatever you read in the book brought half of the dead.
5561640	5562640	Let me hear my options.
5562640	5563640	Fiendish monster is centipede.
5563640	5564640	Fiendish monster is spider.
5564640	5565640	Fiendish snake.
5565640	5566640	Fiendish wolf.
5566640	5567640	Fiendish snake.
5567640	5568640	I feel like...
5568640	5569640	Steel eagle.
5569640	5570640	I like fiendish wolf.
5570640	5571640	Fiendish wolf.
5571640	5572640	Fiendish wolf.
5572640	5574640	It's boring, but it's effective.
5574640	5576640	Like sort of like Lady in Red.
5576640	5580640	With a...
5580640	5582640	Let it go, Christopher.
5582640	5584640	It is a panty dropper.
5584640	5587640	A lot of people did their first kiss to that song.
5588640	5591640	With a plume of smoke and the smell of sulfur.
5591640	5596640	A black, dark looking wolf with red eyes poofs into beer.
5596640	5599640	And lunges for the remaining zombie.
5599640	5601640	Tearing the throat of the zombie.
5601640	5602640	I'm sulfur sensitive.
5602640	5603640	Yeah.
5603640	5605640	The zombie lies slain.
5605640	5606640	Yes.
5606640	5607640	So are we free of zombies right now?
5607640	5609640	You're free of unentangled zombies.
5609640	5612640	Potentially the rest of them could get out if you give them long enough.
5612640	5615640	All right, we should go to the place that I know that the Soul of Growth is at.
5615640	5616640	Yeah, where is it?
5616640	5617640	It's...
5617640	5618640	I know where it is.
5618640	5620640	Don't say Radio City.
5620640	5621640	If we...
5621640	5622640	It's there.
5622640	5624640	If we already drove by it, I'll be so mad.
5624640	5625640	No, no, no.
5625640	5626640	No, no, no, no, no.
5626640	5627640	Okay.
5627640	5631640	It's just there's a lot of Dunkin' Donuts in this area, so it looks...
5631640	5632640	Can we go to...
5632640	5637640	As you travel, the trees get thinner and give way to smooth, flat stone tiles.
5637640	5641640	The floor appears ancient as part of some long past civilization.
5641640	5643640	I think we're going the right way.
5643640	5645640	Seems like a cliffhanger, right?
5645640	5646640	Seems like a cliffhanger.
5646640	5649640	Cliffhanger!
5649640	5663640	I think we should thank Bob Goldthwaite and Kumail Nanjiani for coming by.
5663640	5666640	Bob Goldthwaite.
5666640	5669640	Kumail Nanjiani.
5669640	5671640	What's that?
5671640	5673640	No, I didn't say anything.
5674640	5676640	But you told me I could stop by anytime.
5676640	5677640	Yeah, and you should.
5677640	5678640	Okay.
5678640	5679640	You always should.
5679640	5680640	I take that really seriously.
5680640	5682640	No, you should take it very seriously.
5682640	5685640	I don't say it to random people.
5685640	5687640	Bob Goldthwaite should come by anytime, right?
5687640	5688640	Oh, thanks, man.
5688640	5689640	Thanks a lot.
5689640	5690640	Very much so.
5690640	5692640	We actually insist now.
5692640	5694640	We require your presence.
5694640	5695640	Yeah.
5695640	5696640	I like it.
5696640	5697640	I like it a lot.
5697640	5698640	I also...
5698640	5700640	I found out when we came back from tour.
5700640	5702640	I am not like me by myself.
5702640	5706640	It's like, because I'm self-actualized and perfect, because I've become like part man,
5706640	5707640	part God.
5707640	5709640	Kind of boring, like talking...
5709640	5711640	You know, he doesn't like washing his ass.
5711640	5712640	Who cares?
5712640	5713640	Like, I don't care.
5713640	5716640	Like, exciting people, exciting people coming by.
5716640	5718640	Look how much fun we have.
5718640	5721640	And look how it dies when they leave.
5721640	5724640	Yeah, we could have ended on that.
5724640	5727640	We could have played Xanadu and that could have been the end of the show.
5727640	5733640	But it sounds like now I've got 150 hostages.
5733640	5734640	And I say that...
5734640	5736640	Sounds like now I can do whatever I want.
5736640	5739640	Right now, I'd say, like, you know, like, five minute warning.
5739640	5740640	I'm like, certainly.
5740640	5742640	Like, we could end the show right now.
5742640	5744640	Well, a little bit dumb ending.
5744640	5745640	Dumb ending.
5745640	5750640	I'm just saying, like...
5750640	5752640	Hey, Camille, Bob, shut the fuck up.
5752640	5753640	No, don't worry.
5753640	5754640	That's a...
5754640	5755640	Maybe just...
5755640	5756640	They're not being too loud.
5756640	5757640	They're just...
5757640	5758640	They're coming off a high.
5758640	5760640	Holy fuck, I love being on the show.
5760640	5761640	It's fucking amazing.
5761640	5762640	Does it fill you the way it fills me?
5762640	5764640	No, it fills me more than it fills you.
5764640	5766640	They love it.
5766640	5767640	That's not...
5767640	5769640	That's not their fault.
5769640	5773640	You don't blame Moses for coming down from the mountain and going,
5773640	5774640	Holy shit!
5774640	5777640	Ten commandments?
5777640	5778640	He's been somewhere.
5778640	5780640	He's contacted something.
5780640	5783640	Yeah, he's been to Mount Sinai and spoken to Yahweh.
5783640	5785640	What do we do to close the show?
5785640	5786640	I don't know.
5786640	5787640	What do we do?
5787640	5788640	Anybody?
5788640	5789640	Rap.
5789640	5790640	Rap?
5790640	5791640	I heard rap.
5791640	5792640	Dance off.
5792640	5793640	Dance off.
5793640	5794640	Johnny Cash.
5794640	5795640	Johnny Cash.
5795640	5796640	You know what?
5796640	5797640	Now we can do Johnny Cash.
5797640	5799640	We can do Johnny Cash again.
5799640	5801640	Johnny Cash, dance off rap.
5801640	5803640	Johnny Cash.
5803640	5805640	Johnny Cash, dance off rap.
5805640	5807640	Okay, just the Berg songs.
5807640	5809640	Yeah, I don't know.
5809640	5811640	Chicken noodle date.
5811640	5812640	Chicken noodle date?
5812640	5814640	Let's not keep the floor open this long.
5815640	5816640	Let's talk to some people.
5816640	5817640	Did you have a good time?
5817640	5818640	Wait, which is the gay...
5818640	5819640	You're the gay friend, right?
5819640	5820640	Yes.
5820640	5821640	What's your name?
5821640	5822640	Scott.
5822640	5823640	Scott.
5823640	5824640	And so you're the gay friend of...
5824640	5825640	Stephanie.
5825640	5826640	Stephanie.
5826640	5827640	And you're the straight friend of Stephanie.
5827640	5828640	Yes.
5828640	5829640	Your name is...
5829640	5830640	Connor.
5830640	5831640	Connor.
5831640	5832640	Okay.
5832640	5833640	Did I incriminate any of the three of you?
5833640	5834640	Okay.
5834640	5835640	By the time this airs, no one's going to go like,
5835640	5836640	You said on your Facebook, you're single.
5836640	5837640	All right.
5837640	5840640	Don't want to fuck anything up.
5845640	5847640	I hear that Connor's coming.
5847640	5849640	He's coming out with me.
5849640	5854640	I'm going to bring my gay friend and we'll have to see
5854640	5860640	whether he gets along with all my gay friends.
5864640	5867640	I can't remember names, my friends.
5867640	5870640	I don't know how this song will end.
5870640	5871640	I don't know.
5871640	5872640	Come on.
5873640	5875640	It's got to be something different this time, Jeff.
5875640	5876640	It's been a fantastic show.
5876640	5877640	This is a new harm in town.
5877640	5878640	It's a rebirth.
5878640	5881640	We're like, you know, transformer fans.
5881640	5883640	Megatron turned into...
5883640	5884640	What was his name?
5884640	5885640	Galvatron.
5885640	5886640	Galvatron.
5886640	5888640	I was going to say Ultratron.
5888640	5889640	Galvatron.
5889640	5892640	Oh, Galvatron.
5892640	5893640	You bathe in the lava.
5893640	5894640	You come out.
5894640	5895640	You're new.
5895640	5897640	Granted, he's a villain, but, you know,
5897640	5899640	what did Optimus Prime give us?
5899640	5900640	Garbage.
5901640	5903640	He's a terrible person.
5903640	5904640	He's like, got a thing.
5904640	5906640	It is to use this in your darkest hours.
5906640	5908640	Stupid, dumb.
5908640	5911640	Like a hero bathes...
5915640	5916640	Is what I'm saying.
5916640	5917640	There we go.
5917640	5921640	A hero dunks himself down into hot liquid,
5921640	5925640	comes up changed every Saturday.
5930640	5931640	All right.
5931640	5932640	All right.
5932640	5933640	No, we're going to do this right.
5933640	5934640	We've had a great show.
5934640	5935640	Perfect time limit.
5935640	5937640	Like, we're going to fucking nail this one.
5937640	5939640	This is going to be one for the record books, Jeff.
5939640	5941640	This is going to be the...
5941640	5944640	I don't know, say the Dungeons and Dragons episode.
5944640	5945640	Oh, shit.
5945640	5946640	Really?
5946640	5947640	Yo.
5947640	5948640	Yo.
5948640	5949640	Yo.
5949640	5950640	Yo.
5950640	5951640	Yo.
5951640	5952640	Yeah.
5952640	5953640	Yo.
5953640	5954640	Wrap it up.
5954640	5955640	Freestyle.
5955640	5956640	Wrap it.
5956640	5959640	Wrap it up off the top of my head.
5959640	5961640	Pudding and bread.
5961640	5964640	You didn't hear me when I said pudding and bread.
5964640	5965640	That's what I said.
5965640	5968640	Instead, you open up your cupboards, look inside,
5968640	5971640	you see a cup, you pull it out, and you take liquid,
5971640	5975640	fill it up, and you drink it down, goes into your tummy,
5975640	5978640	and then you sit with your mama, play gin rummy.
5978640	5982640	You see, you put the Ace of Spades on the table.
5982640	5983640	I didn't know you could play.
5983640	5987640	I didn't say I was able, but I beat this bitch
5987640	5990640	because she's so old that her pussy has an extra stitch,
5990640	5991640	and I...
5991640	5994640	Come on down to Harman Town.
5994640	5997640	Turn that frown upside down.
5997640	5998640	Stretching.
5998640	6000640	The yellow poop is brown.
6000640	6001640	Bad rap.
6001640	6003640	Turn that frown to Harman Town.
6003640	6006640	Yo, scintillating spirit going through my body,
6006640	6008640	and I didn't even fear it.
6008640	6011640	Said it like your mama said, fuck me.
6011640	6015640	I fucked your mama so hard, she was a huckney.
6015640	6017640	That's a new word that I made up.
6017640	6021640	It means a kind of person wants to get fucked.
6021640	6023640	Went to her house, said, are you a huckney?
6023640	6024640	She said, who me?
6024640	6025640	I said, yeah, you.
6025640	6027640	She said, yeah, me.
6027640	6029640	Went inside to the foyer.
6029640	6030640	Hung my hat.
6030640	6031640	Fuck your pussy.
6031640	6032640	Fuck your titties.
6032640	6033640	Fuck your ass.
6033640	6034640	Think about that.
6034640	6035640	Your daddy was at work.
6035640	6038640	Maybe he should re-prioritize.
6038640	6039640	Jerk.
6039640	6042640	Come on down to Harman Town.
6042640	6045640	Turn that frown upside down.
6045640	6046640	What's your name?
6046640	6047640	Christian?
6047640	6048640	Yeah.
6048640	6049640	It doesn't matter.
6049640	6051640	It doesn't matter.
6051640	6054640	Christian wearing a brown jacket.
6054640	6056640	It's actually black, but you can't see it.
6056640	6058640	Fack it.
6058640	6061640	Fack it's a word.
6061640	6063640	Pooping a turd.
6063640	6065640	Turd goes into the toilet, goes down,
6065640	6068640	goes into the sewer pipe, goes all around,
6068640	6071640	goes to the place where they turn poop into water,
6071640	6073640	comes out of the faucet,
6073640	6075640	and it's drunken by your sons and daughters.
6075640	6077640	Then they put it into their tummies,
6077640	6079640	and they poop it out, and they go,
6079640	6081640	oh, that was so yummy.
6081640	6082640	Soil and green.
6082640	6084640	Don't you see the lies?
6084640	6085640	Open your mouth.
6085640	6086640	Open your eyes.
6086640	6089640	Yeah, yeah, but Dan, Dan, use all of your magic powers
6089640	6091640	and tell us what you've learned about the difference
6091640	6093640	between baths and showers.
6093640	6095640	Yo.
6095640	6096640	Yo.
6096640	6097640	Yeah.
6097640	6098640	Yo.
6098640	6099640	Yeah.
6099640	6100640	Yo.
6100640	6102640	You go into the tub, and you stand still.
6102640	6103640	Education.
6103640	6105640	The water comes out, but it's like Hank Hill.
6105640	6107640	It just stands there.
6107640	6110640	It's on the air forever, and it sprays off your body,
6110640	6112640	and there's no endeavor.
6112640	6115640	But when you soak inside some hot goo,
6115640	6117640	then it makes you a whole new you.
6117640	6120640	When you go into it, it's like getting baptized,
6120640	6122640	and you come out, and you're a different guy,
6122640	6125640	and you go, surprise, motherfucker.
6125640	6127640	I'm a brand new Dan Harmon.
6127640	6129640	I'm extra clean and extra charming.
6129640	6130640	Yeah, but Dan, Dan, yeah.
6130640	6132640	I know that you'd rather be alive than dead,
6132640	6133640	but tell me if you were a doctor,
6133640	6135640	but you wanted to be a comedian instead.
6135640	6137640	Yo, if my name was Sophie,
6137640	6141640	then I'd try to go to UCB and get an extra trophy.
6141640	6143640	I'd try to get taught by Matt Besser,
6143640	6146640	and if I couldn't do that, I'd go to somewhere lesser,
6146640	6148640	like I.O. West.
6148640	6149640	It's a good place.
6149640	6151640	It's not the best, but, you know,
6151640	6153640	you can still learn some shit and go to the test.
6153640	6157640	You can get on stage, and if you can't do improv,
6157640	6160640	you can be in a cage match.
6160640	6162640	It's a good place for a workshop,
6162640	6165640	but it's kind of like the equivalent of pig slop,
6165640	6167640	but, you know, you pay $500,
6167640	6170640	and then they tell you, oh, here's the rules.
6170640	6171640	Here's your collar.
6171640	6174640	All right, Dan, now, since you got us all captive here,
6174640	6176640	tell us why it's better to say high-five the gay guy
6176640	6178640	than smear the queer.
6178640	6180640	Wait, sorry, I didn't understand your question.
6180640	6182640	Why is it better to say high-five the gay guy
6182640	6183640	than smear the queer?
6183640	6186640	Oh, because gay people from the beginning of time
6186640	6189640	always tried to do things with just an extra-cultural lime.
6189640	6192640	They tried to put it on the cocktail rim.
6192640	6195640	Does it matter if you fuck a her or fuck a him?
6195640	6196640	No.
6196640	6197640	I don't think so.
6197640	6199640	I doubt it.
6199640	6201640	I really doubt it.
6201640	6204640	Come on down to harm and sound.
6204640	6206640	Thank you, everybody, for coming.
6206640	6209640	One more time for Bobcat Goldthwaite,
6209640	6211640	Camille Nantiani,
6211640	6214640	Spencer Crichton, everyone.
6217640	6220640	Once again, I'm your Comptroller, Jeff Davis,
6220640	6223640	and your mayor, Dan Harmon.
6224640	6225640	Thank you.
6225640	6227640	You're wonderful and beautiful.
6227640	6230640	We'll probably see you at the drawing room
6230640	6232640	on Melbourne and Hillhurst.
6239640	6240640	Remember this?
6240640	6242640	It's a good old day.
6246640	6252640	A place where nobody dared to go.
6252640	6255640	The love that we came to know
6255640	6258640	they called it Xanadu.
6258640	6261640	Oh, change your mind.
6261640	6267640	And now, open your eyes and see
6267640	6270640	what we have made it real.
6270640	6275640	We are in Xanadu.
6275640	6278640	And now, open your eyes and see
6278640	6281640	what we have made it real.
6281640	6284640	I'm way up like a sword
6284640	6287640	dancing a crazy rock
6287640	6290640	fishing at its lowest
6290640	6293640	a never-lasting look
6293640	6296640	in your feeling me
6296640	6299640	Xanadu.
6299640	6302640	Xanadu.
6302640	6304640	Xanadu.
6304640	6306640	Xanadu.
6306640	6309640	Xanadu.
6309640	6313640	Xanadu.
6313640	6316640	Xanadu.
6316640	6320640	Now we are here in Xanadu.
6320640	6325640	Xanadu, your neon lights will shine
6325640	6330640	for you to Xanadu.
6331640	6337640	In love, the echoes of long ago
6337640	6340640	you needed the world to know
6340640	6346640	they are in Xanadu.
6346640	6352640	The dream that came through a million years
6352640	6355640	that lived on through all the tears
6355640	6358640	it came to Xanadu.
