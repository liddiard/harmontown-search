15920	24320	Hello gang, how you doing?
24320	29360	Ooh, sexy late arrivals.
29360	41920	Cartha Park is melting in the dark.
41920	45040	All that sweet green icing flowing down.
45040	46440	Welcome to Harman Town.
46440	50880	Harman Town is now in session ladies and gentlemen.
50880	55840	So ladies and gentlemen and everybody there in between, I'm Jeff Davis, here comes total.
55840	69000	Let's bring out your Game Master, Jordan Arrow, Spencer Crittenden.
69000	70000	We are the Dreaming of Dreams.
70000	71000	Let's bring out the dreamer of best dreams.
71000	74000	Let's bring out the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
74000	86120	Oh yeah, talking about, talking about the summer and the season.
86120	94440	Damn, I remember a girl when you used to be around the way, used to be downtown, used
94440	100320	to back in the day, used to seems like it used to be back in the day.
100320	109760	Damn, used to be back in the day, seems like long ago, used to be from around the way,
109760	115120	back in the D, to the A, to the Y, back in the day.
115120	119440	Okay, all right.
119440	122360	That was like a, that was like a summer hit.
122360	127680	Yeah, I accidentally wrote the most touching, you know, if you follow me on Instagram, which
127680	128680	you have no choice.
128680	135000	I mean, that's like, that's my big platform now, I'm an Instagrammer, and I was driven
135000	141920	from Twitter with pitchforks and torches, yeah, or you could look at a variety of otherwise.
141920	147840	I was driven from it by decent minded taxpayers who just don't want a monster on their phone.
147840	156200	And, you know, look, semantics, but you say monster, I say monster.
156200	159120	I'm so squirrely tonight.
159120	164320	Steve Levy with Ice Bucket everybody, Steve Levy on the ice solo.
164320	169040	But I, yeah, I don't know, well, I was, I've been improvising these songs in my car and
169040	170280	then I bring them home.
170280	171280	How do you do it?
171280	173600	Is your phone mounted on a thing?
173600	176600	I just got a, I'm like, I'm a moving target here.
176600	181800	I don't have a, you know, I keep, you know, I keep changing my process, but I'm like,
181800	185360	Are you driving or are you letting Tesla do the heavy lifting?
185360	192320	I'm mostly driving, I mean, I did some singing today, hands free, but, you know, it doesn't,
192320	193320	the difference.
193320	195120	Do you do the hands free Tesla stuff?
195120	196440	Like, do you actually let the car drive?
196440	197440	On the freeway, yeah.
197440	198440	Yeah, absolutely.
198440	199440	100%.
199440	200440	It's a way better driver than me, for sure.
200440	207960	I mean, I'm not kidding, it has a million sensors, I've always been, I just, I get
207960	211280	such a panic about lane changes.
211280	213680	Like I'm just so bad at blind spot stuff.
213680	218560	I just, it makes it all the worse than I'm so phobic about cutting someone off.
218560	222080	Okay, so you're on the five freeway, you're going toward the interchange where you could
222080	224720	go to Glendale or you could stay on the five.
224720	230200	And the car knows that you're going to go to Starburns, it changes lanes for you?
230200	234200	Yeah, all of the freeway stuff, as soon as you're, once you're on the freeway, now it'll,
234200	236840	yeah, it'll change lanes for you.
236840	238040	They're upgrading as it goes.
238040	239040	It's kind of fun.
239040	240520	It feels like you're like a beta tester.
240520	243280	It's like they, they issue these upgrades, you know?
243720	244720	It's not.
244720	245720	Terrifying.
245720	250960	Well, it doesn't, it doesn't let you, there's nothing to be, it's not going to let you.
250960	255040	But it knows the guy behind you isn't a fucking lunatic and it's not going to run you down.
255040	257760	It knows that, yes.
257760	258760	It doesn't.
258760	259760	Thank you Spencer.
259760	260760	They just added that.
260760	266200	Did you hear, there was this guy who like, he died, supposedly the auto, the autopilot
266200	270720	just knocked him into the side, the highway defighter or something and just smashed his
270720	272240	car all up to death.
272240	276960	It's, it's, yeah, I'm not, I'm not going to trust the thing for decades.
276960	281680	I mean, I, but it is, what it is, is it's like the best cruise control ever.
281680	282680	Right.
282680	284040	It just, it just, it takes care.
284040	290120	It takes like a fucking grunt work and frustration out of, like, driving.
290120	292480	Are your hands like on the wheel and your feet on the pedals?
292480	294080	Yeah, that's the legal standard.
294080	295080	You got to do that.
295080	296080	So that's what he does.
296080	297080	Yeah.
297080	298080	Yeah.
298080	299080	Yeah.
299080	300080	I'm not going to go to sleep.
300080	303440	I will take advantage of it wanting to do the work for me.
303440	308560	It has sensors all over it that are better at, at telling me if there's anyone in my
308560	309560	blind spot.
309560	313600	Like I'm still going to look, you know, I'm just, I'm just doing, I'm just more relaxed
313600	314600	now.
314600	317600	It's not like I'm like sleeping, it won't let you.
317600	320000	But what's interesting is how they're like rolling out these upgrades.
320000	321120	I didn't want to talk about this.
321120	324960	This is douche talk, but, but it is, it is fun to like, you're getting these upgrades
324960	329080	and like it was for a while, you get on the freeway and then it would like, it was, it
329080	333560	was like, oh, I'm going to change lanes, but you have to confirm that I can change
333560	334560	lanes.
334560	335560	How?
335560	340320	By using the, the signal, but it's just like, it was just felt like such a, it was like,
340320	341320	what are we doing here?
341320	345760	You know, it was like, like, like I, I'm signaling, like just let me turn the goddamn wheel.
345760	347720	But like now it's changed.
347720	351560	Now it's, it's, it's like, oh no, it'll, it'll signal on its own.
351560	354800	All you have to do is keep your hands on the wheel because it, before it changes lanes,
354800	358560	it just wants to check in with you and you give a little resistance on the wheel to prove
358560	360840	that you're not asleep in the backseat.
360840	363920	Anyways, I didn't want to talk about that.
363920	366240	It's, I love my fucking car.
366240	367240	I think it's so cool.
367240	370680	I love the people that try to like make me not love it.
370680	376520	When I see you, when I look at your awesome Instagram songs, my question is are, like,
376520	379080	how much are you driving or not driving while you're doing that?
379080	386720	I'm probably 95% of the time I'm driving because I'm probably not on the freeway or if I am,
387160	390720	yeah, the auto driving thing is not like, it's not a minority report.
390720	394720	It's not, it's not like I did today because I was going all the way to Encino.
394720	400280	So I was for a while, I was just chilling hands-free while I was making up a song.
400280	404760	And maybe that's why I came up with this, I'm not going to play it, but I just like,
404760	406200	it was like this really touching song.
406200	410680	It was like, like I just started singing like a, what it was like, where are my homies?
410680	413360	Where are my friends who wrote this movie?
413360	414360	How does it end?
414360	419680	Or it turned out to be about gay gangbangers from, it was like, it's just the way the
419680	420680	rhymes worked.
420680	424400	It was like, I got to the end of it and I was like, oh my God, that's so touching.
424400	426320	Like, it's not even funny at all.
426320	430040	In fact, if you perceived it as a joke, then it would be a homophobic joke.
430040	436280	So I better be serious about this beautiful love story between two fucking gay dudes from
436280	441400	East LA that just want to run away together because away rhymes with gay.
441400	443120	But also because it's a beautiful story.
443120	447080	Anyways, I'm assuming we have more people in the audience tonight than usual because
447080	448800	of our handsome friends that are here.
448800	449800	Oh yeah.
449800	450800	Is that true?
450800	451800	How many people are here for our guests?
451800	452800	Okay.
452800	453800	Thank you.
453800	454800	Great.
454800	457800	I think that was 11.
457800	458800	Oh, wait.
458800	459800	Are you here?
459800	461600	Did I, did I say something that ended up on TMZ?
461600	462600	Is that why you're here?
462600	463600	I don't.
463600	464600	Okay.
464600	472800	Am I, am I, am I racist again?
472800	473800	You know what?
473800	474800	I'll field that.
474800	475800	I am.
475800	480560	You were off it for a while, but you're back, baby.
480560	483200	I tried to quit.
483200	484400	You got to accept the thoughts already.
484400	485400	Give me the interview.
485400	486400	Take a contrary action.
486400	487400	Okay.
487400	491000	I don't want to cheat our guests of time, but I just wanted to like, okay.
491000	496200	So I still maintain you are overreacting to the Lime Scooter thing.
496200	501320	I think that, you know, but there's this new thing that you guys are doing.
501320	508880	At first you were like, I don't like these scooters because they're new and they're everywhere.
508880	509880	You don't like new things.
509880	510880	They're everywhere.
510880	512320	We were just talking about this backstage.
512320	515080	That's why you don't support the transgender community or anything like that.
515080	519360	You hate different things that are sweeping and changing the way people and challenging
519360	520360	people.
520360	521360	Right?
521360	522360	No, you're hypocrites.
522360	528680	Like maybe your sidewalk is identifying as like, uh, Orwellian lately, like it's a fucking
528680	529680	scooter.
529680	530680	I think it's a great idea.
530680	531680	Maybe it's not.
531680	532680	Let's find out.
532680	534680	Don't police it.
534680	535680	That being said, like I'm 46.
535680	539440	I'm not going to use one of these things for, I'm like, I'd see him, I go one of these days.
539440	540440	I'm going to use one of these.
540440	541440	They're fun.
541440	542440	They're so fun.
542440	546560	Um, so the day finally came, I'm drive, I drive home from work and there's one right
546560	547560	in front of my house.
547560	548560	Okay.
548560	549560	It's parked there.
549560	550560	I'm like, this is probably it.
550560	554680	Cause I'm going to be late to little doms, which is like probably a seven and a half
554680	555680	minute walk.
555680	557760	It's impossible to drive there and park, et cetera.
557760	559920	It's like, this is the, this is scooter time.
559920	561600	It's four blocks from your place.
561600	565320	It's yeah, it's, it was just right enough that I'm like, okay, how long is the process
565320	569920	going to be of like the first time you do, I'm assuming there's a QR code on on my,
569920	573680	I'm like, if this is as easy as one of those vending machines where the, the, with the
573680	578040	QR code app, I'm like, man, am I glad I embraced that technology?
578040	583280	Like I became Lord of the Fritos and like, um, only in that one city, but like I'm, maybe
583280	584920	I'm going to become scooter guy now.
584920	585920	This is it.
585920	589600	I walked down there and I'm like, I scanned the QR code.
589600	590600	We're off to the races.
590600	592400	We've got an app loading.
592400	593400	Okay.
593400	598920	Um, and, uh, this guy my age, he's got a wallet chain.
598920	603360	Oh, um, good start.
603360	608160	He's I just don't understand this impulse from people like he sees me, I guess he's
608160	609160	a neighbor.
609160	615800	He felt very comfortable talking to me like, like, like, I, I, I, like he, he, he sees
615800	621160	me from he's, he's a hundred yards away and he starts walking towards me diagonally across
621160	629440	the street while shouting out in a parent camaraderie assumed camaraderie with me because,
629440	634560	but he sees me scanning the scooter, but he's just, he's got filled with so much hatred
634560	639600	about the scooters that he must assume that I'm like reporting the scooter to the Gen
639600	645080	X times or something like, here's another one.
645080	647840	This they have too much avocado toast all the time.
647840	652040	No, if I'm going to hate millennials, it's going to be for a really good reason, but
652040	655000	not because of the fucking contributions.
655000	661720	Jesus, because of the other stuff, like the dumb name, for instance, you're trying to
661720	663320	get online with the scooter.
663320	667360	So I'm like, yeah, I'm like interacting with it and he's just like, how comfortable could
667360	671280	you ever be in the assumption that, oh, he goes, he goes, you know what I'd like to do
671280	672280	with those fucking things.
672280	675760	I'd like to take every single one of those motherfuckers, put it on my truck, take it
675760	678480	to the city dump.
678480	679480	You could do that.
679480	680480	He could do that.
680480	682520	No one's stopping him from doing that.
682520	687120	Also, it's a weird flex is what the kids would say.
687120	691480	That's a South Park episode, the Halloween episode where somebody does that and takes
691480	693440	all the scooters and throws them off of a cliff.
693440	694440	Oh shit, man.
694440	699160	The Rick and Morty one's not coming out for three years.
699160	700160	That's right.
700160	705800	That lasted a long time ago, don't, South Park did it to like, no, South Park's going
705800	707000	to do it.
707000	708000	Don't do it.
708000	710080	But anyways, the guy.
710080	712840	So he tries to bond with you about hating these things.
712840	717600	In the time it takes him to finish saying all that, it's like back time, the edit, so
717600	723040	that he finishes it in my face, which is weird.
723040	726480	He starts talking, it's like, I'm on a city dump.
726480	727480	And now he's here.
727480	732360	I'm like, hi.
732360	736920	And before I can ask the question, which I'm not going to, oh, here's what I did say.
736920	744520	I'm like, I went, well, make sure you do that after this thing saves my bacon.
744520	745520	What?
745520	746920	Hell yeah.
746920	751560	And I said, well, I'm late for a meeting and I'm kind of mumbling and stammering and I'm
751560	752560	not making eye contact.
752560	757240	This guy is clearly like, he's got to be either.
757240	762200	I'm thinking grip.
762200	765200	Possibly key.
765200	768920	He had the authority of a key.
768920	774240	He might've been best boy.
774240	781200	He had an alpha fucking energy, a wallet chain, like eye contact, like eye fucking looking
781200	786520	at shit that doesn't want to look at him, like eye contact with everything, especially me.
786520	787520	Who wants to look at me?
787520	788520	Someone look at me.
788520	790520	I got shit to do.
790520	795760	And I mean, the guy that's going to save my life and steal Cody when the zombies come,
795760	796760	you know?
796760	799680	But he crossed the street to engage with you about this particular thing.
799680	800680	Yeah.
800680	807280	I mean, he was kind of like walking in a way that he was just patrolling the neighborhood
807280	811960	with his little clangy chain.
811960	814720	And so then he said, that's something to talk about, someone to interact with.
814720	815840	He's like, let's be neighbors.
815840	818440	And he starts shouting this thing at me.
818440	821920	So then I go, he doesn't understand me because I'm stammering and mumbling.
821920	828080	I'm like, well, I just, I want to try it out.
828080	831280	But then he doesn't really seem to hear that, which is fine.
831280	832280	I don't fault him that.
832280	833280	I'm not a good communicator.
833280	839680	And then he's like, but the question in my head was like, what's your proposed beef?
839680	840680	Like what is it?
840680	841680	An eye sore?
841680	843680	You're wearing a wallet chain.
844680	849760	What is the fucking beef is what I want to know.
849760	855560	And I hadn't read any news about it and stuff like that, but he goes, people are getting
855560	861000	on these fucking things drunk and they're bashing their heads open.
861000	869960	I wanted to say, I didn't say this, but I'm like, oh, oh, you're a humanitarian.
869960	872160	You love people.
872160	879120	Your beef with the scooters is that you hope more people that ride scooters, you wish that
879120	883560	they just had long, happy lives, which is going to be exemplified by his next statement
883560	887160	because then he finally takes in that I'm like, I got my credit card out and I'm trying
887160	888160	to do this thing.
888160	893760	And he goes, and he, I wrote it down and he literally said, you said, you're not going
893760	898280	to ride that fucking thing, are you?
898280	904000	And I said, yeah, I'm going to try.
904000	907960	And he was like, and he walked away.
907960	912360	And then I never, I got to the point, I had scanned my driver's license, I had scanned,
912360	917760	you know, it's dark out and it took me like eight minutes and I was, I was like, you could
917760	918760	have walked there.
918760	921800	I got to that point where I was like, at this point you could have walked there.
921800	923040	So now are you an idiot?
923040	924360	If you keep going, are you an idiot?
924360	927720	If you stop and I just, it asked for a credit card and I was like, I'm outie.
928160	929040	That's what the kids say.
929040	933760	They, they add a, they add a Y to the out, they don't say that.
933800	936200	Sometimes they say outie five thousand.
936200	938880	That's a reference to the Audi five thousand automobile.
939480	940760	It's a very modern car.
942400	944760	Another thing they'll say is it's like a G6.
945800	947440	Something will be like a G6.
948400	950760	That means it's like a airplane.
952560	953360	That's Fergie.
954840	956080	You could be Audi five thousand.
956080	957240	You could be like G6.
957440	960000	Dan, did you ever get on the vehicle and, and, and.
960000	960560	No, I did not.
960560	962560	I gave up and I walked because it asked for a credit card.
962560	966200	I was like, my driver's license was hard enough and that's got a, that's got a barcode
966200	967160	on it that it could scan.
967480	968320	It was dusk.
968360	972280	It was not having a, my phone was not having a good time scanning stuff.
972280	973240	I quit while I was ahead.
973440	978440	Plus the thing, and this is the thing that I have, so if that is your beef, the head
978440	979040	injury thing.
979040	983120	So apparently then I go meet my friends at dinner and I, I'm like, oh, this crazy guy
983120	984760	and this beef that people have with these scooters.
984760	985200	What's the deal?
985280	987840	Turns out all my friends have beef with these scooters.
987840	989240	I'm just odd man out.
989240	991760	No one, because they're a hazard.
991760	993480	Like people are, yes, they're there.
993480	996480	You can go and you can hashtag this and you can watch everybody.
996720	999480	What I just, the thing set.
999480	1003440	The reason why I really did give up is because it told me a thousand times you're
1003440	1004920	supposed to be wearing a helmet.
1005280	1007960	And I was just like, nobody wears a helmet with us.
1008320	1010960	No one wears a helmet on a bike, but it's also a good idea.
1011000	1012440	I was kind of, I was worried.
1012440	1013960	I wasn't really worried about being injured.
1013960	1014760	I was actually worried.
1014760	1018520	It's like between that guy yelling, this thing harp in about helmets.
1018520	1020520	I was like, it'll be just my luck.
1020520	1026720	I'll get like pulled over like, like, like a community outreach cop program will be
1026720	1031600	like, you know, there must have been already DUIs on these scooters, right?
1032200	1035760	Somebody has to say that people are getting drunk and they're getting on them and
1035760	1037720	they're, and they're, and they're getting head injuries.
1037720	1041400	But like, I don't, I'm not one of those people that's like, ooh, that's the Darwin
1041400	1042440	up to, you know, thing.
1042440	1044280	But like, I don't, I don't think people should get hurt.
1044280	1045080	I don't want them to get hurt.
1045080	1047320	I don't, I don't care how bad you are.
1047560	1049640	I hope, I hope Hitler had a good day.
1049640	1051800	His, his last day before he killed himself.
1051800	1055920	Like I wish he hadn't killed so many people, but I also like, I don't, I don't,
1055920	1058440	I don't, I don't, I'm not a capital punishment guy.
1058440	1060360	I don't think they, I don't want people to suffer.
1060720	1060920	All right.
1060920	1062080	Don't take that out of context.
1063760	1065200	I hope Hitler had a good day.
1067880	1069280	What context should we take that in?
1069920	1070280	I don't know.
1070280	1073040	Actually that could only help my political numbers right now.
1074040	1077840	I should, I should just get on the bandwagon that's leaving the station, right?
1078680	1079920	Do bandwagons leave stations?
1079920	1080120	All right.
1080120	1080400	Come on.
1080400	1082640	We, we got, we got, we got a, we got a big show tonight.
1085200	1087520	I'm just saying, like, isn't it, it's kind of weird.
1087520	1091440	It's like, like, like, like people are, are you really mad about the people that
1091440	1095040	you, it's like, pick a lane, like you're grossing about this thing.
1095040	1098520	Are you, are you really, because you're worried, it kind of goes back to my, like,
1098520	1101520	probably the first episode of the show where I'm like, that's the shoe tying thing.
1101960	1105640	I'm like, you don't really care if I trip and fall, you're excited that my
1105640	1106840	shoelaces are untied.
1106840	1109720	It's like your little, your little corner of the world.
1109720	1110000	Yeah.
1110000	1111760	You see a shoelace untied.
1111760	1113640	It's like time for you to be empowered.
1113680	1117000	I just, I just wish that, that, that people on the East gooders, like do what you
1117000	1120000	want, but obey the regular laws.
1120040	1120320	Right.
1120360	1123240	Don't be on the fucking sidewalk and run me down as I walk.
1123720	1124320	That was the other thing.
1124320	1125240	That's true bikes though, too.
1125240	1128720	Like there's tons of people who just blow through intersections on bikes and stuff.
1128760	1130160	It's like, well, that's kind of dangerous.
1130160	1130960	I don't like that.
1131000	1134400	There was one, there was one kid, I wanted to murder this fucking kid.
1134720	1137640	It wasn't the scooter's fault, but it was just perfect that he was on one of these
1137640	1142640	fucking things and he did have a helmet on dork and, uh, but he was at an
1142640	1145840	intersection and he's, he's, he's driving in the street on one of these
1145840	1146720	scooters with a helmet on.
1146720	1148520	So he's, he's by the book, baby.
1148560	1149840	I wanted to murder him.
1150000	1154320	He, um, because he pulled up to the intersection and he's just, he's
1154320	1159360	directing traffic at a four way intersection and he keeps like, he's
1159360	1162640	doing that thing where he's looking at me and like, because his hand
1162640	1166080	movement, isn't making my car move forward, which would have caused it to
1166080	1169960	collide with oncoming traffic because it's a fucking intersection.
1169960	1171960	And he's only focused on the car.
1171960	1175840	He wants to move like he's trained for this and he's just like getting
1175840	1180240	pissed at me and I'm like sealed in my car and I can't go, you fucking asshole.
1180240	1182400	That dude, you're, you're trying to make me die.
1183080	1185600	This, you know, those people that they started, they're, they're like, they,
1185600	1187200	they just have this nervous tick.
1187200	1191480	They get to a four way stop and they're like, they're like, like they, like
1191480	1194560	they're all something, they're the boss of you because like, they're like, oh
1194560	1195600	yeah, you go, you go.
1195640	1198440	And then you don't, you might have a reason to not go.
1198760	1202280	Like there's sheep in front of you or something or a bike and the, and the
1202280	1206200	person's not is only looking at you and they're like, Oh, it's that good.
1210040	1210440	Nope.
1210480	1211960	No one can relate to that story.
1212040	1212640	I can't.
1213240	1216920	You haven't been an intersection where sheep crossing and people are mad.
1217440	1218760	No, that happens to me all the time.
1218760	1222720	I think I do that sometimes, but usually I clock it before like the second wave.
1222720	1224440	I'm like, Oh, there's someone I can't see.
1224440	1225120	Okay, I'm done.
1225160	1226560	I would never take that baton.
1226560	1229480	I'm not in charge of why we go to fucking driver's ed.
1229480	1232840	Like, what do we, you don't have to worry about what other people are doing.
1233320	1233720	What do you do?
1233720	1234640	What do you, what are you doing?
1234640	1236280	Like waving your hand at me?
1236320	1238200	I was in Tulsa, Oklahoma last weekend.
1238240	1241240	And, uh, it was like, uh, Kentucky Derby day.
1241360	1242320	Are you even listening to me?
1242320	1242840	Yes.
1242920	1243360	I'm kidding.
1243360	1243880	I'm just kidding.
1243920	1247440	I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm expounding upon your thesis here.
1247440	1251800	I, I, there was people that were going to watch the Kentucky Derby and they were
1251800	1255960	drunk and they were all on East scooters around Tulsa, Oklahoma, and everybody was
1255960	1259720	fucking shit canned and it was just a bunch of people that shouldn't have been
1259720	1261280	driving on an East scooter drunk.
1261560	1265680	And it was like, I'm going to watch somebody get murdered by a, by a moving
1265720	1267080	like, like, like SUV.
1267120	1268000	That could be fun though.
1269440	1273480	The only argument I understand is like what people say about like motorcycles
1273480	1275320	or like driving without insurance.
1275320	1280680	Like it's like you, it's the, even if it's just you getting injured, like you
1280680	1283960	can fuck up the lives of people around you by getting injured.
1283960	1287120	I get, I mean, it's like, but that's kind of like, like really that's your
1287120	1290600	reasoning, like, like, like, you know, like, like about like why things need
1290600	1293520	to be like, why you're really concerned about this prayer.
1293560	1294560	Oh, they're not wearing a helmet.
1294560	1299960	So if I hit them, I'll be guilty of murder instead of, uh, injuring them.
1300000	1300920	What are the rules?
1300920	1305640	Like if you go and you see like a bird or a lime or whatever the fuck the
1305640	1310240	scooters are and you go see one, let's say you're 14 years old and you have
1310240	1312120	your mother's credit card, you can, you can write it.
1312720	1314680	I think you got to be 18, but I'm not sure.
1315120	1318320	I mean, I'm sure you get, I have a credit card and I'm sure I'd probably, I'm,
1318360	1320160	they would be smart to say you got to be 18.
1320320	1323800	I mean, you know, the kids, they got these things they're called skate boards.
1324120	1327480	I mean, if you're really, that's the thing that's bumming you out is like
1327480	1328640	the potential for injury.
1328640	1331520	You know, these kids are a really, they're up to no good.
1331600	1334360	Like they've got all kinds of shit with wheels on it.
1334560	1334720	Yeah.
1334720	1336880	I saw a little girl the other day.
1336880	1340200	She had two tiny skateboards on her feet.
1341560	1343280	She's just licking a lollipop.
1343280	1344400	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
1344400	1346280	Like rolling around.
1347240	1348560	I'm like, I pulled over.
1348560	1350240	I'm like, you piece of fucking shit.
1350840	1354360	I'd like to cut your fucking feet off and take them to the city dump.
1355360	1364040	Our next guest, uh, uh, these guys, I just, I just laid eyes on them for the first time
1364040	1364520	backstage.
1364520	1366920	They're so handsome for podcasters.
1368040	1370960	They're really intimidatingly good looking.
1372680	1373480	Well, let's bring them out.
1373560	1374000	Okay.
1374320	1377760	Uh, please welcome Sean and Hayes from the Hollywood Handbook.
1377760	1384840	Sean, there's Hayes.
1388560	1390120	You guys agree that your hands are wearing.
1390120	1390440	Okay.
1391880	1392760	That's very kind.
1392800	1393920	That is so nice.
1393960	1394800	Thank you, Dan.
1395120	1403280	For podcasters is a good, you know, I mean, otherwise I'd have, all right, or anything.
1403280	1405440	You guys are, you guys are cute as buttons.
1405480	1407280	Actors are podcasting now though.
1407320	1410960	Dan, I know on a Ferris has a podcast.
1411000	1415200	We got to get away from this idea that it's just for the misfits anymore.
1415240	1417640	They're, they're, they're, these guys are moving in.
1417680	1418400	I got to stop.
1418960	1419400	Right.
1419760	1423280	It's, yeah, it is, it is, it is turned into just mainstream.
1423720	1425440	Uh, yeah, I'm not welcome here.
1425480	1430480	Dan, if I may actually, I could kind of tie two things together here because you
1430480	1433880	were talking about Hayes being handsome and you were talking about scooters a lot.
1434280	1439440	And he actually has been known around town lately as the scooty cutie.
1439480	1443280	And I do wear a helmet and I do wear a helmet.
1443320	1444880	I scoot all over the place.
1444880	1445800	I scooted here.
1445800	1447840	We were talking about it backstage.
1448240	1450880	Uh, and I am sort of becoming known as a scooty cutie.
1450920	1453640	Who, who has called you the scooty cutie?
1453640	1454920	People yelling from their cars.
1455240	1455440	Yeah.
1456240	1456800	I make sense.
1456800	1460520	So you'll be, you'll be scooting down the road and someone will go like, Hey,
1460520	1462640	scooty cutie, scooty, scooty, scooty, scooty.
1462720	1464760	Like kind of a Doppler honey.
1464760	1465920	That's the scooty cutie.
1465920	1466240	Yes.
1466440	1467520	Are you, are you making that up?
1467520	1469680	Or is it an actual thing?
1469800	1474960	It's hard to hear exactly what they're saying, but you've chosen, you've chosen
1474960	1478400	to hear a scooty cutie that has been one interpretation of it.
1478400	1478720	Yeah.
1479640	1484040	Uh, Sean also has been started scooting a little bit and he also has a name,
1484320	1486360	which is, uh, the lima Rita.
1487720	1487960	Yeah.
1487960	1491040	I, I only use the lime scooters and if I'm guilty of anything, it's
1491040	1492160	being a little too sweet.
1493640	1495440	That's your, that's your scooting style.
1495440	1501520	It's a little too, a little more, a little more triple sec than was necessary.
1502040	1502640	That's right.
1502800	1503200	All right.
1503560	1505600	Do you want to hear a horrible thing?
1505600	1507080	A scooter story that happened on the way here?
1507080	1507240	Yeah.
1507240	1510600	I was riding on the sidewalk.
1510600	1513200	What would you have to do in a lot of parts of the city?
1513200	1514880	This is just way too dangerous to be in the street.
1515320	1521760	Um, and I was coming up on citizens arrest approaching me.
1522280	1529960	Uh, were an older couple pushing a shopping cart full of cans and I start
1529960	1532400	to move into the street, but it is way too late.
1532400	1537480	They are like fully taking their shopping cart and like moving it out of the way
1537680	1539880	so that I can pass on my scooter.
1540280	1542280	And I thought like, I'm never taking this again.
1542280	1543760	This is like not fair.
1543760	1548200	I'm taking up too much sidewalk space, but then I had an epiphany, which is that
1548200	1550920	me and these guys should team up against the cars.
1551240	1553640	And we should take over the street.
1554840	1559360	Those are the real enemies are the cars you're supposed to be on the street.
1559960	1563320	You're not supposed to use those on the side, which is why citizens arrest.
1563640	1565240	No, you broke the law.
1565280	1566080	You confessed.
1566080	1567040	It's recorded.
1568040	1569880	They're also not supposed to have a shopping cart.
1570160	1573800	Like, okay, so we ended up arresting each other.
1573800	1574160	Yes.
1574160	1575400	We're finally punching up.
1575400	1579480	Let's get the guys with the shopping carts finally punching up.
1580920	1587680	I, yeah, I, boy, it is so hard for me to punch up these days.
1589800	1593360	I found out a way to punch down without getting called out for it though.
1593360	1596440	Cause I was, I was telling you guys backstage, like I feel like the next door
1596440	1601200	app, I was looking through my next door app thing and I was like, I think you
1601200	1605760	couldn't humiliate these people without punching down because they are, they're
1605760	1609800	loud and proud about, they want people to know, like if they want it, if they could,
1609800	1612840	they would make the world know that someone pooped without cleaning it up
1612840	1614400	outside their apartment or whatever.
1614400	1618240	And it's like, I don't think people would be like, Oh, you're, you're, you're
1618240	1621040	punching down by like reading their posts out loud.
1621080	1621320	Yeah.
1621320	1622640	They're property owners.
1622720	1625440	You can do, it's open season on next door people.
1626000	1630120	Um, yeah, I, uh, let's see.
1630120	1632040	How do you, how does your phone work?
1632160	1635280	You know who I see sometimes on the next door in my neighborhood is a
1635280	1635760	Sklar.
1636640	1637720	Oh, okay.
1637760	1638960	I won't say which one.
1641040	1642160	Here's one that's adorable.
1642560	1643680	I've known them forever.
1643720	1646320	I can only remember one of their names at one time.
1646600	1648120	I can never remember which one is it right now.
1649600	1650000	Randy.
1650200	1650640	Yeah.
1650680	1651160	Randy.
1651200	1651400	Yeah.
1651400	1652000	That's mine too.
1652080	1652280	Yeah.
1652280	1654080	But then next time it says, okay.
1654800	1655160	Yeah.
1655280	1658280	I mean, what's the reward for learning both Sklar names?
1658280	1659960	Like you can't tell them apart.
1659960	1664240	So one of them's Eugene, like, wait, who that's to get you nowhere.
1664440	1666880	You would never approach them and be like, Randy Jason.
1666920	1667240	Right.
1667240	1668480	You just say like, Hey guys.
1668720	1669040	Yeah.
1669920	1677120	Uh, I mean, my, this way, I like, these are my 19 year old son needs a summer job.
1678080	1679160	I just thought that was kind of cute.
1679440	1685360	Like as a, as a, as a, as a true crime listener, I just felt like, and they're
1685360	1688920	out early on it as well, they're getting a jumpstart.
1688960	1690400	Yeah, I know.
1690400	1692360	It's like, does that son like want that?
1692880	1698000	This, this, this, this is sort of like a, this isn't like, I, I, I read this
1698000	1701360	one as a person, so this person has this security camera footage that they've
1701360	1705840	posted here in next door and it says neighbor leaving dog poop behind
1705880	1707400	followed by a hair flip.
1708120	1715080	Um, hello neighbors had to post this video of someone in the neighborhood
1715080	1718440	who watches her pit bull take a massive poop, then doesn't even attempt to
1718440	1722320	pick it up, does a hair flip and then appears to reward her dog.
1722320	1722920	It's true.
1723280	1725920	Um, only to leave me to clean up her dog's mess.
1725920	1729680	If anyone knows this, so like, here's the thing about it.
1729680	1733720	It's like, you're posting surveillance footage on a, from a public sidewalk.
1733720	1736320	And I, I'm not saying that that should be illegal.
1736920	1742760	It, but on the hierarchy of shame, like, like, like, if I was doing this, maybe
1742760	1747760	it's a generational thing, but I would be like, uh, uh, by the way, I have a
1747760	1752920	fucking camera on the sidewalk, like, uh, cause, uh, someone punched me once.
1752960	1757800	I would like try to like, I, cause I feel like, like surveilling people
1759080	1760520	you don't have to explain.
1760720	1761160	I know.
1761160	1764400	It's like, it's like, it's like, it's like the person is like, thank God I'm
1764400	1768720	surveilling because now I can like put this person on, uh, you know, I could just
1768720	1772640	like, and I'm not, yeah, the next logical step would be that someone would be like,
1772640	1775320	Hey, I put a camera in my bathroom during a party.
1775320	1776760	I was throwing, right?
1776760	1778560	Check out this guy didn't wash his hands.
1778560	1781960	You'd be like, but you shouldn't have, why was there a camera in the bathroom?
1781960	1785600	Because, because in this neighborhood, I'm like the Vlad the Impaler.
1785600	1788480	I live in this big house overlooking all these numbskulls.
1788480	1793360	Like, I just feel like I feel now that I'm seeing this app, I'm like, when I
1793360	1796640	leave my house, I'm like, just don't unleash your dog.
1796880	1798760	Like, I don't even have a dog with me.
1798760	1803120	I just, I just like terrified of unleashing or pooping or like, like, because
1803120	1805520	people will be like, you know, who's at it again.
1805520	1809960	Like I'm going to, I'm already a pinata, but like, this is a thunderdome.
1809960	1810960	This fucking app.
1811400	1811720	Okay.
1811720	1814640	Here's a, here's a, here's a, here's a, here's a, here's a weird one.
1816320	1817520	Uh, okay.
1817560	1820520	Uh, dog bark collar is the headline.
1821360	1823400	Would it bark collar?
1823440	1823800	Yeah.
1824520	1832560	Would any of you lovely Los Feliz neighbors happen to have a very small bark
1832560	1836160	collar I could borrow for my eight pound Havanese puppy?
1837000	1840480	I'm not entirely sure it will work as I've heard some dogs don't
1840480	1842040	care and just keep barking.
1842040	1846120	So would like to borrow one first to see how he reacts to it.
1846520	1850800	I'd really love to not have my apartment neighbors kill me due to his barking.
1851360	1854040	Um, I mean, how is this all happening to you?
1854480	1855640	This person doesn't have a dog.
1856960	1858920	They are not using the collar for that.
1859920	1862000	I'm specific on the breed of dog.
1862000	1862600	Yes.
1862680	1864040	Like just too many details.
1864040	1864760	It's a classic.
1864760	1865240	Oh, that.
1865240	1865640	Yes.
1865680	1865960	Yeah.
1865960	1870200	This person is only not a serial killer because no one's gotten between them and,
1870200	1872200	and, and, and, and, and what they need.
1872200	1872640	Right?
1872640	1873800	Like they're a sociopath.
1873800	1875280	Like they're just showing the early side.
1875280	1878600	They're 19 and they're just, they haven't hurt anyone yet, but they're like,
1878600	1880640	this is all one poster.
1880880	1881120	Yeah.
1881120	1883720	This is, I just, I couldn't even fathom that.
1883960	1888160	What's crazy is the fucking responder and the hair flip and the, oh, no, no, no, no,
1888480	1891880	Dan, what platform, how did this cross your doorstep?
1891880	1893800	Like, this is an app called next door.
1893840	1894080	Okay.
1894080	1897480	So your neighbors are posting things so you can see what's going on in the hood.
1897520	1897800	Right.
1897840	1898960	And this comes across.
1898960	1899320	Okay.
1899320	1899520	Yeah.
1899520	1904120	And I'm like, okay, this, so my, my first, it's, I, I, I end up, I end up liking this
1904120	1907600	person a lot more than the people that are responding, which is crazy because I don't
1907600	1908320	like this person.
1908320	1913800	I'm like, you, your dog, your, your dog, it's like that very small in caps.
1913800	1917280	It's like, like, don't give me the wrong size collar for my dog.
1917280	1921640	I need to stop barking so that my neighbors don't hate me.
1922480	1923960	My neighbors, who are you?
1924000	1924400	Yeah.
1925600	1929840	I've got a lot of stuff happening to me and I would appreciate it if it cost as
1929840	1933920	little as possible, like, well, then when a neighbor knocks on the door to be like,
1933920	1934840	Hey, your dog won't stop barking.
1934840	1937000	It's like, well, I put it on next door.
1937040	1939400	So at that point it was your court.
1941840	1946040	Uh, but it was like the crazy thing is the, uh, wait, where are there, I thought I
1946480	1948280	thought I had done what I asked.
1949840	1951200	So who are you mad at me or you?
1953480	1954840	Where's the, okay, there it is.
1954840	1955600	Would you okay.
1955600	1955840	What?
1956080	1960240	And then, so then, so then this guy, the first respondent, so, so get ready for,
1960280	1962880	you know, you're like, okay, that's Godzilla.
1962880	1967320	Well, here comes and these, these, these responses are going to be people that live
1967320	1969600	in the neighborhood that are on your, yep.
1969760	1970320	On your team.
1970520	1973520	So Robert responds to this Jenna.
1973520	1974320	These are first names.
1974320	1975440	Oh, he's the first responder.
1975560	1981040	Yeah, Robert is the first responder and says, your dog's barking is caused by
1981040	1988200	emotional slash environmental issues and cannot be silenced with
1988200	1992160	collars that shock fucking Robert.
1992240	1994480	Now, then she don't play.
1994520	1999960	I did, I did forget to read as did Robert, um, that there's a little PS on
1999960	2004440	Jenna's original post, which says, please note, no, I am not going to shock my dog.
2004440	2006920	I am interested only in the beeping or vibration mode.
2007120	2008320	She probably added that after this.
2008920	2013680	But she, she responds, Robert, did you read my post in its entirety?
2013920	2017600	Because I specifically noted that I am not going to use a shock collar.
2017920	2022160	Um, and then he responds, your little pooch needs to be socialized
2022160	2026400	with other dogs and people look for a doggy and me class someplace
2026400	2028000	like the petco in Glendale.
2028040	2029600	Oh, shit.
2030520	2034800	And Jenna says he has been and continues to be socialized with both
2034800	2037000	people and dogs quite frequently.
2037000	2041040	Actually, I'm not sure what that has to do with him barking when he is home alone
2041040	2044840	as they don't co-relate, but thank you for sharing your opinion and suggestion.
2045680	2050160	And I'm like, okay, team Jenna, please tell me that these two end up fucking,
2051000	2053840	I mean, at least they ended up killing each other.
2053840	2056960	It's kind of a Sam and Diane kind of cheers situation going on.
2056960	2062160	Then then Marie interjects and goes, try some calming pills.
2062520	2065680	You can. Oh, Robert is not going to like this.
2068240	2070400	You can go online. Petco has them.
2070440	2073080	Wait, is she talking about the dog or her?
2075320	2078320	She's saying take a chill pill bill before you end up in the hospital.
2078360	2083960	When I am going to bout, I give them one a half hour before leaving.
2083960	2085240	I also have pet zoom.
2085240	2087160	It's so weak pet trainer.
2087160	2088120	Hope this helps out.
2088120	2091920	I mean, this person is like this person driving pills as fast as. Yeah.
2094160	2098200	And then Angie responds to that going, I don't have a collar, but if open to it,
2098200	2101120	you can try small doses of a natural anti-anxiety for pets.
2101120	2103960	It's called rescue remedy and it works wonders for stressed out dogs.
2104160	2105840	We use it on the Fourth of July every year.
2105840	2108520	Note, I'm not a vet. Please check with your vet first.
2110040	2112760	And then Jenna, I'm on team Angie right now.
2112760	2114880	Team Angie sounds like the most level headed.
2114880	2117920	I don't I don't I don't know like how comfortable these people are with dog
2117920	2122880	pharmaceuticals like like Jenna's like, like, yes, totally open to it.
2122880	2124640	I'm familiar with it, but have not used it.
2124640	2125760	Thinking about buying it.
2125760	2128320	I used CBD oil in the beginning.
2128520	2130040	Yeah, I know about this.
2130040	2132440	Yeah. What the fuck is going on with it lately?
2132440	2134720	Like now I'm on that didn't work.
2134920	2137760	The CBD dog treats. Yeah, that's out there. Yeah.
2137760	2140000	I think Robert who is the first person that said,
2140000	2141800	just socialize your dog and take him for a walk.
2141800	2143760	That was Robert and he's he's gone.
2143760	2147160	He actually suggested a doggy in me class at the Petco in Glendale.
2147440	2150680	That was the specific prescription. And then he moved. Yeah.
2153440	2155760	OK, I one more, one more, and then we're done.
2155760	2157040	Give me a thousand more of these.
2157040	2160160	I love it. This one is really I don't know.
2160200	2163160	Well, what do I why do I have to tee it up? Need advice.
2163920	2165280	Hello.
2167200	2168680	Wait, wait, wait.
2168680	2170800	Tell me the punctuation marks on this one.
2170800	2172920	There's that's that's there's a hello.
2172920	2174840	No punctuation carriage return.
2174840	2177400	OK, so it's like just a single space paragraph.
2177400	2182760	Look out. OK, it's like it's like a submarine commander.
2182760	2184280	To whom? To whom?
2184280	2185160	To whom? To whom?
2185160	2187080	Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
2187080	2189440	Our data shows you're in the Marianas Trent.
2189440	2190960	Over. Hello.
2193320	2196040	Hello. I need advice on what to do.
2196040	2200880	Maring it down.
2202120	2205040	I believe that a neighbor is starving their dog.
2205720	2210320	I offered to find her a home because they've told me that they don't want her.
2210640	2214440	But when I did, they wanted a seven hundred and fifty dollar rehoming
2214440	2216960	fee to find her a good and loving home.
2216960	2221400	When I said no and any would be better, their response was vulgar.
2222040	2225840	I can PM a video of the dog.
2227280	2230040	Well, that's like that's a like a ransom, right?
2230040	2234800	I tried to piece I was so confused by this, but I think I figured it out.
2235800	2237200	They're evil.
2237200	2239520	Like they probably are starving a dog.
2239520	2243560	And but they're like and she's a little crazy.
2243800	2246040	Is that a maybe that's an unfashionable word these days?
2246040	2247320	But he's on next door.
2247320	2250840	You know, it's but it's crazy meets evil.
2250840	2255040	Like she's she's observing a mistreated dog, an unhappy dog.
2255040	2261320	She's going over to the to the door and she's like, hi, your dog seems miserable.
2262360	2264120	Could I have it?
2266040	2269720	And the person's response was like, yeah, well, you're not wrong.
2271640	2272760	And it's a two way street.
2272760	2274920	I don't even like the fucking thing.
2274920	2277880	I'm thinking, give me a give me a fucking G.
2277880	2279880	Give me a thousand bucks.
2279920	2281280	What?
2281280	2284040	I just want to find your dog a kind and loving home.
2284040	2286880	That's a rehoming fee.
2286880	2287960	Rehoming fee.
2287960	2289120	I've never heard of that.
2289120	2290880	I'm not going to give you seven hundred fifty dollars.
2290880	2293160	Well, then you could go suck a dick.
2295680	2299480	Well, I'm going to suck a dick all the way to my phone
2300680	2302840	and get a ton of advice.
2302840	2308000	Yes, well, I don't know that you could run a protection racket on your on your dog.
2308200	2310520	I mean, it's like I like those.
2310520	2314240	I mean, those there's no way that she's the bad guy, right?
2314240	2317480	Because it's like she's clearly like who who would have that in her.
2317520	2321200	I mean, there we dealt with this in our neighborhood on our Nextdoor app,
2321720	2325640	which is there is a dog who is kept in like a shed
2325640	2331080	and doesn't appear to have like a light or water and like pause at the outside.
2331080	2333400	Yeah, I almost feel like there's one in every neighborhood.
2333520	2336800	Yeah, just people that don't like their culture is like.
2337080	2338640	That's going to be our dog.
2338640	2339480	I think that's right.
2339480	2340920	They're just like, well, that's a guard dog.
2340920	2345120	Yeah, which means like we don't feed it because we want to keep it mean basically.
2345680	2349480	And there's not a lot to do.
2349760	2353440	You could certainly post on Nextdoor, but I think they're going to say
2353480	2355800	what your friend found is what it's going to be.
2355800	2357800	People saying, call animal control, call animal control.
2357800	2360440	Animal control is going to say where you're basically
2361600	2362680	you're going to say suck a dick.
2362680	2368720	I mean, their response is ultimately vulgar because there's there's not much that you can do.
2369600	2370800	So, yeah, that's OK.
2370800	2372560	That's my Nextdoor app segment.
2372560	2373720	Thanks for joining me on it.
2373720	2381200	I you must have had to avoid all the posts of people saying like a Latino guy looked at my house.
2381200	2382560	Casing, casing.
2382560	2386280	Is there a number that's more urgent than 911?
2388400	2392480	If you're I mean, if you're if the guy with the wallet chain that yelled at the scooter,
2392480	2396120	if he was brown, he would have been casing my house on Nextdoor app.
2396600	2401440	Everyone that's walking around the neighborhood doing anything other than hauling in cartoon
2401440	2404840	groceries with a baguette sticking out the top for the you know,
2406200	2408640	Caucasian supplies labeled on the on the bag.
2411760	2415600	Here's some here's pink and blue paint for the nursery and some baguettes.
2416760	2419000	I'm the first act of a Stephen King novel.
2420000	2423480	Everyone else is casing, casing, casing, casing.
2423480	2427800	There's the top post on mine today is shady character.
2427800	2431320	Yeah, it's just like there's a shady character.
2431320	2431840	Right.
2431840	2435240	You should they should use something more tasteful like spooky or smoky.
2439360	2440680	We cut my laugh on that.
2440680	2446400	I got mad at you for a second, but I'm like, what reward for solidarity?
2446400	2450600	So go on without me, survive, survive, my young man.
2450600	2453320	Most people listening won't know which one that was.
2453320	2455520	So I think I think we're OK.
2455520	2457600	Yeah, so Hollywood.
2457600	2460520	Oh, boy, you guys have this podcast, the Hollywood Handbook.
2460520	2462120	Yeah, listen to a couple of episodes.
2462120	2465000	Your roster of guests is is is impressive.
2465000	2466600	I think it's going to be great.
2466680	2468000	Listen to a couple of episodes.
2468000	2470880	Your roster of guests is is impressive.
2470880	2471560	It's ear wolf.
2471560	2475800	So, you know, you guys just you guys just hoard all of the guests.
2476200	2477680	Yeah, yeah.
2477680	2480840	I yeah, I wish there were more stuff to say about our show.
2481240	2483040	There is a ton.
2483040	2487840	Thank you for everyone who clapped, who said that they were here.
2487840	2490240	That said that we're aware of us.
2490240	2491520	It's very funny.
2491520	2494520	Thank you. Everyone who didn't.
2494520	2497000	You can't just clap like.
2498880	2500800	We can hear you.
2500800	2502400	We're right back there.
2502400	2504360	I'm holding that happens free.
2504360	2506680	What is the format of the Hollywood Handbook?
2506920	2510120	Oh, wow.
2510120	2513080	What do you say when people ask you, what's the format of this show?
2513800	2517920	It's it's pretty sad, port himself a hefty flag in the vodka.
2518920	2522920	Well, Hayes, I think, has characterized the show well.
2522920	2524960	That is mostly funny comments.
2529280	2532640	But the walk me through it because I'm new to the game.
2532640	2536320	So like you start a show and what like we are.
2536320	2539600	So the opening theme song, this will be good for anyone
2539600	2543800	who wants to try to listen to what we give an example.
2543880	2545600	Tim Heidecker was on the show recently.
2545600	2547160	Thank you for listening to two episodes.
2547160	2550160	He came on and told us that he did not get through the first act,
2550680	2553560	which was seven minutes long.
2553560	2555280	So there are a couple of barriers to entry.
2555280	2559760	We've been told that the show takes 15 to 20 episodes to get into.
2559760	2564080	I think I said that I saw someone said it's an acquired taste.
2564120	2566200	I wish I was never going to because I thought that was so funny
2566200	2567920	because I was like, oh, it sounds like I'll get along with them.
2567920	2570880	Like, that's got to be what people say about this.
2570880	2574200	Is there a name of an episode that we can like, like, what's a good first
2574200	2577920	like like order to enter into this world?
2577920	2579720	You said you listened to the Heather and Campbell one.
2579720	2581360	I think that one is pretty good.
2581360	2582360	Heather is fucking fantastic.
2582360	2583440	And by the way, I counted it.
2583440	2586320	I don't I don't I mean, I acquired that taste instantly,
2586320	2587600	which means it's not an acquired taste.
2587600	2588600	You guys are. Oh, that's so nice.
2588600	2589680	Clearly funny and charming.
2589680	2593320	And I it's and Spencer is a big fan and was on there.
2593320	2594880	Oh, yeah, it was.
2594880	2598000	I tell people that it's kind of like people trying to improvise.
2598000	2599960	Like, it's like an improv sketch, but the sketches,
2599960	2601600	they're just having a conversation.
2601600	2603200	A bad, the worst conversation.
2603200	2604720	The worst. Yeah, too.
2604720	2611400	Yeah. Well, we're in character as two petty idiots, which is just like
2611400	2613520	one degree off from our actual personality.
2613520	2616560	Have you guys ever have you guys ever listened to Peter Cook
2616560	2619480	and Dudley Moore like Clive and Derek or Derek and Clive?
2620520	2623120	No, but I'm going to start saying it's my inspiration.
2624080	2627520	Yeah, they made these records where they just they just have studio time
2627520	2629720	and they would just improvise and they made these records
2629720	2633920	where it's just Dudley Moore and Peter Cook just doing for me
2633920	2635800	the funniest improv of all time.
2635800	2639520	But it's it's just two assholes talking as two fake characters
2639520	2641680	named Derek and Clive. It's really funny.
2641680	2645680	I since you brought since you you I was I wasn't sure.
2646240	2647320	Everyone's got a different philosophy.
2647320	2649840	I didn't know if I was allowed to say, oh, you're doing characters.
2649840	2654560	You know, like, I don't know if you're like, so you don't break that spell.
2654600	2657880	No, we'd like a line drawn for the catalog stuff.
2657880	2660280	But it's like it kind of reminds me of
2661360	2666640	it's like it's a less arch Jiminy Glick, like Martin Short doing Jiminy Glick.
2666640	2668880	Yeah, absolutely talented. Yeah, yeah.
2668880	2671720	Yeah, it's not the yeah, we're not Martin Short.
2671720	2675520	But you guys are supposedly Hollywood insiders
2675520	2679680	and you have guests on and then your characters are clearly.
2679760	2680960	Yeah, they don't know.
2680960	2684480	So when Heather and Campbell, who's one of my favorite improv heroes,
2684680	2687400	when she came on, is she in character or is she doing?
2687400	2688920	She's playing herself.
2688920	2693880	And so she took the strong choice to hate us for the entire episode.
2694840	2699920	But we're we were asking her to do voiceover
2699920	2702320	for a video game that we were designed.
2702320	2705880	Yeah. And so we're like feeding her lines and describing what's happening.
2705880	2708320	It was a video game adaptation of the Ryan Reynolds
2708840	2711000	Sandra Bullock film, The Proposal. That's right.
2711000	2715120	But but this is right.
2715120	2718960	You guys, I think you guys are really smart because like it occurred to me then
2718960	2721640	because I was like, why did they did they just have that up their sleeve?
2721640	2724920	I mean, that's fine to have that in your iCloud, as my ex-wife would call it.
2724920	2727880	Like I have like five things I'm pulling out that week.
2728200	2731480	But but then I'm like, oh, no, it's because because it's you.
2731480	2732800	You asked her about video games.
2732800	2733720	You said what's popular?
2733720	2736360	She said Fortnite and you guys are like two weeks notice.
2736600	2740400	Yeah. And you start you have you seen The Proposal? I have it.
2740520	2743920	I have not seen it. Yeah, I saw it.
2743920	2746200	I remember the poster at Wilshire and Westwood.
2746200	2750720	You know, that giant billboard on the like on the building there.
2750720	2752840	That's all I know. I kind of liked it proposal.
2752840	2753880	Yeah, I was kind of into it.
2753880	2755120	I remember hearing it was OK.
2755120	2759320	And I knew like the plot synopsis, which was helpful for the episode.
2759320	2763600	We did. Is your show always guest based or sometimes just you two?
2764480	2766920	We do two episodes a week.
2767560	2770240	One is an hour long episode with a guest.
2770240	2771600	And one is a half hour episode.
2771600	2775880	That's just the two of us exploring some kind of teaching you how to do something.
2775880	2778400	And that one, for some reason, costs money.
2778920	2782680	Yeah, the one without the guest is the one you have to pay for the subscription site.
2782960	2785720	Yeah. So not everybody, because that's what that's that's the
2786160	2788880	because if you've ever seen Jiminy Glick, Jeff, like like Mark Chark doing the thing,
2788880	2792000	like it's like because it's like, oh, if Tom Hanks does Jiminy Glick,
2792000	2793800	is he is he playing a character or is he?
2793800	2795600	But it's like the answer is, well, you know, he's Tom Hanks
2795600	2796840	and he's just reacting.
2796840	2800560	The only thing he doesn't do is say, get that prosthetic chin off of your face,
2800560	2801840	Martin Short. Right.
2801840	2805840	He pretends there's a real person to asking these questions, but then reacts.
2805840	2809400	What was Martin Short's line to to Ben Stiller?
2810320	2812880	Ben, are you are you difficult?
2815280	2817120	Are you moody?
2817120	2819920	Are you moody, Ben Stiller?
2819920	2823400	That's great. I really want I think I think Martin Short, like I think we went
2823440	2827960	I think we asked after like the idea of Martin Short being on here.
2828320	2830800	I like I think he passed.
2830800	2833520	And I mean, that's why we're here today.
2834440	2838240	He I do. Are you guys fans or are you sure?
2838440	2842800	Yeah, I mean, what are you going to say? No, no, I was definitely a fan of Jiminy Glick.
2842800	2843680	I thought it was so funny.
2843680	2847640	The two things I think we compared our show to initially, like when we'd get
2847640	2852200	guests and be like, it's kind of like this was like we did sometimes say
2852840	2855520	Jiminy Glick and also like Colbert Report.
2855520	2860160	And I had seen a video after we had started doing the show of Colbert meeting
2860840	2863640	someone like meeting Obama or someone and being like,
2863880	2865000	just so you know, here's the thing.
2865000	2869120	When we get on camera, I'm a total idiot on the show and I'll be saying stupid shit.
2869120	2871320	And you and like I was like, oh, it's cool.
2871320	2872960	This is what we have to do to everyone.
2872960	2876000	We're like, hey, we're going to we're going to completely misunderstand
2876000	2879440	everything you're saying and like not really know your career
2879440	2881000	and like misquote things at you.
2881000	2882920	Your guests are always people that are hip to that.
2882920	2884520	It's not you. Not always.
2884520	2885800	Yeah, not always.
2885800	2888040	There was famously one incident
2889720	2891760	with Paulie Shore came.
2891760	2894800	He was in kind of he was a thank you so much.
2895000	2897080	He was the lowest moment of my life.
2898880	2900600	He was in kind of a hurry.
2900600	2903760	And as we start to be like, hey, just so you know, he's like, come on, let's just do it.
2903760	2906360	Let's just go. Oh, no.
2906360	2908800	We described it and he said, he said, well, what if I hate that?
2908800	2910640	And I just walk out, then what happens?
2910640	2913000	And we were like, let's just record. Let's just go.
2913000	2914720	Let's just go. Are you going Rome?
2914720	2918000	And then he immediately started giving us the wrap it up hand signal
2918000	2921080	like five minutes in or is it a five minute episode?
2921080	2925080	Well, it's shorter than Paulie is known for having so much great material.
2925960	2927120	Yes.
2930240	2931920	He was a terrible person.
2931920	2934400	He called Sean. He called Sean a homo.
2934400	2935880	He called me a homo on the show.
2935880	2937080	He's not funny.
2937080	2938000	He's not still.
2938000	2940000	But he probably broke the syllables up.
2940000	2941920	So it was funny.
2941920	2945240	You probably think that was actually a point of good.
2945240	2949040	I kept saying I kept asking him about wheezing the juice.
2949520	2951600	And then I would say it like that.
2951600	2953920	And he'd go, well, no, it's you wheezing the job.
2954640	2955640	And I would go, right.
2955640	2956480	You're wheezing the juice.
2956480	2957960	And he's like, don't say it like a fucking homo.
2957960	2961560	And I was like, uh, I'm sorry.
2962680	2966240	I'm not like brave enough to be like, hey, we don't say that anymore.
2966600	2971920	But I'm also like sort of doing the character.
2971920	2973840	You're like, OK, I guess.
2973840	2979280	Yeah, we bravely took it on in the next episode when he had not been at the studio for a week.
2979480	2980440	Yeah. Oh, man.
2980440	2984720	As I've been led to believe, if you leave the donuts out, he's going to glaze him.
2986360	2988040	That's one of his fucking jokes.
2988040	2989200	He's the worst comic.
2989200	2990280	Well, it's a job for it.
2990280	2993320	So that's probably one of his jokes from twenty five years ago.
2993760	3000080	All of us, he's going to come on our donuts or donuts, also a metaphor for something else.
3000280	3002240	Yeah, that's kind of his premise.
3002360	3006360	Oh, like like like if there's a girl in the room, I'm going to come on it.
3006720	3011280	Well, yeah, it doesn't age well, but if he's alone in the room with a woman used to be able to do that.
3011440	3017760	Yeah. I mean, there's a movie called Revenge of the Nerds, where the nerds are today's definition of rapists.
3018760	3020520	Masked rapist.
3022960	3025360	Yeah, everything was kind of inverted back then.
3025840	3031520	If you if you if you if you if you if you if you smoked enough weed
3032920	3039000	and danced enough, you could you could just dress up as Darth Vader and rape somebody.
3039000	3044920	You could advocate for all manner of assault as long as whatever kept your ski mountain in business.
3045320	3046320	Huh.
3047320	3052480	All you had to do is declare yourself a misfit, even though now these days we're like misfits.
3052480	3058120	You guys look like the the fucking rally, the Unite the Right rally.
3059280	3062680	Oh, like I need a little more diversity in my misfits.
3064600	3066480	Remember misfits of science?
3066480	3075840	Oh, no, no, 1980s series from the Golden Age of probably NBC, I'm assuming, and probably six episodes and out.
3075840	3081800	They had it was like a like a this guy who Courtney Cox was was in it.
3082080	3085560	She was like the Carrie psychic girl.
3085920	3087360	Like she had psychic powers.
3087360	3091320	And then there was this I thought of that when I thought we need diversity with our misfits,
3091320	3095080	because one of their misfits was the basketball player who could shrink.
3097280	3098760	It's funny because he's huge.
3098760	3103920	And then he would shrink and then he would have like a little like napkin around him because his clothes don't shrink.
3104400	3108720	Right. And then and then and then there was this dude who was like very Kevin Bacon.
3108720	3109800	He but he wasn't there.
3109800	3112440	Clearly, they were clearly they were like, can we get Kevin Bacon?
3112440	3113800	The answer is no. And then they got this guy.
3113800	3115720	And I'm sorry if that guy hears this and is like, fuck you.
3116720	3120480	But he was like, his name was Johnny Lightning because he could shoot lightning out of his.
3120480	3124960	I think that guy is probably pretty happy to be hearing misfits of science brought up.
3124960	3127920	I would love to have that cast of science.
3127960	3132840	Yeah, I'm not hearing a lot of it was like weird science, you know, like it was all that, like everything.
3132840	3137520	It's like the the the song weird, weird science and the movie weird science.
3137520	3143280	It was sort of like we had that odd time in our cultural history when the computer was new.
3143840	3148360	And everything scientific was cool. Right.
3148520	3149720	But it was also nerdy.
3149720	3154440	So it was like there were just a lot of TV shows and movies about like, wow, man, science.
3154840	3157160	She blinded me with science of getting laid.
3157160	3163800	Yeah, like Scott Bayou and Zapt was like, like, like, I'm not going to make your bra pop off with my mind.
3164560	3165840	I'm using science.
3165840	3168240	Is this God? Is this God?
3168240	3171720	Hashtag rape culture.
3171720	3174120	And they did missions or what are they?
3174120	3175600	They're fighting guys. The misfits.
3175600	3180440	Yeah, I know. I wish I could remember like how they justified that they had to go do stuff.
3180440	3185560	Right. But it was kind of like very much X-Men because it was sort of like, hey, come on, you guys are different.
3185560	3188400	Like you can have a purpose, though, hang out with me.
3188400	3191640	It was like it was like it was like the coach from White Shadow.
3191640	3195800	I can't I was like it was like this guy was like it was just like this this guy.
3196520	3198920	Back then, you could be a leading man and just look like me.
3199120	3201320	There was just like there were so few men in the world.
3201320	3204320	They're like the the population was like one eighth.
3204320	3205400	That's that's that's that.
3205400	3209160	If you're ever wondering when you look back through reruns and you're like, why Elliott Gould?
3209160	3214360	Like that's the answer is, yeah, like, like, like there was just no cloning yet.
3214400	3217640	The guy I always look at is William Peterson,
3218000	3220240	who is great is in so many great movies.
3220240	3225320	He's like Manhunter and Live and Die in L.A. and has the tightest curls.
3225640	3228040	Just like this set of really tight curls.
3228040	3230600	Is he the is he Manimal?
3230600	3231960	No, he was not Manimal.
3231960	3234040	He's the guy who CSI later.
3234040	3237280	OK, like he was like in the first CSI. Right. That's his name.
3237280	3239160	Yes, William Peterson. Yeah.
3239160	3241360	Yeah, you see Manhunter. Great. Oh, Manhunter.
3241640	3243600	Why did I heard Manimal?
3243600	3246720	No, no, no. He was not the Manhunter.
3246720	3249200	He's the guy hunting the Manhunter. Right. Right.
3249360	3254120	You mean the the the the the the what's the Michael Mann movie?
3254160	3258600	Yes, like Tom Noonan in the Ray Fines role. Yeah. Yes.
3259720	3261600	You should check out that movie if you haven't seen it.
3261600	3265240	It's like it's like it's another adaptation of the Red Dragon book.
3265240	3267920	But from the 80s, it's kind of it's it's it's pretty cool.
3267920	3271440	Oh, that's great. Brian Cox's Hannibal Lecter. Yeah, incredible.
3271440	3273040	Yeah, I think it's like, I mean, I'm not going to.
3273040	3276720	I'm not. It's better than the Ed Norton when I enjoyed both of them.
3276720	3279080	But like, like I'll do it for you.
3280520	3282800	It's better than the Ed Norton one.
3283640	3287600	I feel like it's more I feel like what it it's somehow did a better job
3287600	3291360	of like driving home that idea of like that.
3291360	3296240	The protagonist, he can he can catch these guys because he's he gets inside.
3296240	3298800	He's got a screw loose like he's like he.
3299000	3301000	Well, he's living there like he climbs the train.
3301000	3304440	He finds a little king of our rappers and he's he's like living that guy's
3304440	3307400	whole day going like, oh, I know exactly how you did the crime.
3307400	3308520	It's pretty good. Yeah.
3308520	3312960	And Red Dragon, the refined thing, kind of like it was more like, you know,
3312960	3316280	Ed Norton was there holding down the the the boat.
3316400	3319280	That's an expression. Don't look it up.
3319280	3322240	But but but but like they knew they're they're like,
3322240	3325440	they probably watch the I think they probably watch the Michael Mann.
3325440	3328160	We're like, Tom Noonan's a superstar in this movie.
3328160	3330880	Yeah, let's who do we cast as the Tooth Fairy?
3330880	3333960	OK, we got Ray Fiennes like this movie's about this guy, right?
3333960	3338680	You know, it's not really the hero really isn't the cop who gets in your head.
3338840	3343360	And the third act in both movies, it's like the resolution is, hey,
3343360	3347280	I know enough about you to shame you about your pissing your pants.
3347280	3350080	And like, that's how I get you to relax enough to kill you.
3350360	3353120	Yeah. So it's actually like kind of more apt to.
3353320	3357640	But Manhunter, if I'm not mistaken, has like a weird scene where Tom Noonan
3357640	3360560	like hugs a tiger that's been seen. Oh, my God. No.
3361040	3362440	I'm like that alone.
3362440	3364280	The you've got to watch. Well, in both movies.
3364280	3368440	Wait, I'm like the love theme of the movie plays like this incredible music.
3368480	3371520	Yeah. Well, she in which movie is it where they actually show her?
3371520	3374120	Because I've read the book to where it describes her cupping
3374120	3377360	the tiger's testicles. OK, it's the blind woman.
3377440	3381680	Yeah, he brings a blind woman to feel a tiger that's been sedated.
3381880	3385160	Which I think it's it's it's it's cool.
3385160	3387400	I've never thought about it at a zoo ever since.
3387400	3390120	Every time I see a big animal, I'm like, at some point.
3391080	3394160	In this animal's life, they get sedated.
3394200	3397280	And then the people in the zoo go in like snuggled. Yeah.
3397880	3401520	I just think it's so interesting that he has the empathy to understand
3401520	3404800	that as a blind woman, she might be into that.
3404840	3408680	Yeah. And that also as a blind woman, she's like first and last tiger
3408680	3411200	I'm ever going to touch. Let's check out these nuts.
3412720	3415080	I mean, it makes you love her. It makes you love him.
3415080	3418880	It makes you love very relatable because the tiger is like the tiger.
3418880	3421520	By the way, they state, it's like, oh, he's got a bad tooth.
3421520	3422520	They're going to fix his tooth.
3422520	3426120	But the tiger's like, I did like, do I have any agency?
3426120	3430160	Like, like, I don't get I didn't even sign up to be in a zoo.
3430160	3433040	But but having did they give the tiger like a camera shot?
3433080	3435360	Or he does a camera take while she's filming?
3436520	3439800	Yeah, like it's a living.
3439800	3442320	But which movie is in Manhunter?
3442320	3445160	Do they do the I think it's Red Dragon, where they really are more
3445160	3447520	faithful to the book, where they show a close up of her hand,
3447520	3453080	and kind of cup the the fur fur clad nutsack of this tiger.
3453080	3456800	And then they cut to Ray Fiennes going like he's kind of like
3458320	3460640	vicarious nutsack caressing.
3462280	3465320	I want that blind hand on my scrotum.
3466600	3469880	It's enough to make you not want to eat people.
3471040	3472960	Wait, that's Hannibal.
3472960	3475880	It's enough to make you not want to get a tattoo of a painting across
3475880	3479680	your entire back and superglue Philip Seymour Hoffman to a wheelchair.
3479960	3482360	That's right. Mm hmm.
3482360	3483720	It's a good movie.
3483720	3485040	Both movies are good.
3485040	3489080	Speaking also of when you were talking about unlikely leading men,
3489080	3492160	I did watch a movie from the 70s, not that long ago.
3492160	3496120	And Robert Duvall is the lead.
3496680	3500520	And he always looked like he looked like he is like a real.
3500520	3502040	He's always been 55 years old.
3502040	3504920	Yeah, 55. He's like a heavyset ball dude.
3504920	3507480	He's just like, hey, sweetie.
3507480	3509040	What the fuck is this?
3509040	3510200	The center of the film.
3510200	3512480	It was like black and white movies with Robert Duvall
3512480	3515080	just like picking up his daughter from college.
3515080	3517160	Yeah. It's like how far back we have to go.
3517160	3518280	What film is it with Robert Duvall?
3518280	3519760	I was watching the outfit.
3519760	3520920	You ever. Oh, yeah.
3520920	3523360	And it's like it's like what?
3523360	3528240	Who saw this guy and was like, this is this is this is like the baddest dude.
3528240	3532080	Alpha male like like Mr. Cool.
3532080	3535800	But he's always like he's a New Yorker, even like in true grit.
3536160	3537800	He's a rooster.
3537800	3539280	I got the girl of a rooster.
3539280	3541760	I'm sure the pieces, you son of a bitch.
3541760	3544760	I was like, wait, why is there a New York Jew up and fighting
3544760	3547080	John Wayne at the end of true grit?
3548000	3549040	He's fucking great.
3549040	3551760	We got a big titted hit.
3551760	3553840	You see Charlie Verick.
3553840	3555480	Oh, no, that's fucking what Walter Mathau.
3555480	3558960	Yeah, Walter Mathau again, also looked always like he looked.
3558960	3560400	His jowls are like.
3560400	3563080	If you've not seen Charlie Verick, see Charlie Verick.
3563080	3565280	It's the women are like, oh, Charlie.
3565280	3567000	Come here, you try.
3567000	3568480	People were just 40 back then.
3568480	3569600	And it was fine.
3569600	3571480	Walter Mathau is the least sexy actor.
3571880	3574400	He makes Elliot Gould look like fucking Paul Newman.
3575000	3580200	And Walter Mathau fucks up model in them for no reason.
3580720	3582240	And not that into it.
3582240	3583480	She's all about it.
3583480	3587480	Charlie Verick at the end, there is a car chase or it's a car and an airplane
3587720	3591680	and the car is chasing an airplane, like taxiing around the end of an airport.
3591840	3593240	It's fucking good.
3593240	3596840	But why is why is Walter Mathau getting laid?
3597240	3599040	Because he's not he's not sexy.
3599040	3601880	It was like it was always like and it's a wonder why, you know,
3602880	3605880	like, like, oh, that's why we respected our dad so much
3606320	3607760	because you'd watch movies.
3607760	3610240	You're like, well, this movie is about how robots are cool.
3610240	3614680	But there's that guy that looks like my dad and he's crushing all the puss.
3614720	3617200	Yeah, it's Stacey Key.
3617840	3619640	Like, like everyone was your dad.
3619640	3620800	Stacey Key.
3620800	3625120	Like like the Halloween three season of The Witch.
3625120	3627640	The guy, I can't remember that guy's name, but my friend Viv
3627640	3630720	and I were just talking about this, like we were just laughing about.
3630720	3632080	I was like, like, God, yeah, the 80s.
3632080	3634520	It was like when your dad was the star of every movie.
3634520	3639040	And like Halloween three is not like Michael Myers, like related.
3639040	3640880	It's like this crazy movie about these like
3641880	3645280	science masks that have science in them
3645280	3649280	and some in a Celtic spell that makes snakes come out of kids' mouths.
3649760	3653760	And but and there's just this guy is just like the kind of guy
3653760	3657760	where you look at him and you can smell their socks like, you know,
3658880	3660040	because it's your dad.
3660040	3663520	Well, maybe when I say your dad, it's like you guys are like, no, my dad
3663880	3666760	is like your dad's name is Kale or something like
3668440	3670960	and like and like was in the Peace Corps.
3670960	3675120	Like my generation's dad was just Stacey Keach.
3675120	3678120	It was just like showered every six days.
3678120	3683600	It had a broom mustache and just drank and sweat.
3683600	3687080	And and and if you if you're if you're in a movie,
3687280	3690680	then the law says you're fucking the woman in the movie.
3690680	3694200	And like, it doesn't matter if she's 19 and you're 48.
3694600	3696600	There's just no questions asked.
3696600	3699080	As long as it's not an interracial.
3699080	3702840	Charlie Ferric is a great film, but that weird sex scene is like, no.
3702840	3705400	Like there's no way she fucks fucking Walter Matham.
3705600	3707560	There's no reason for it.
3707560	3710280	They just had to throw that awful scene into that film.
3710400	3713600	And now kids go see like Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans
3713600	3715720	and then just go home and look at their awful dad.
3715720	3716800	Oh, God. Yeah.
3716800	3719320	Is it any wonder that we're like eating ourselves alive?
3719520	3722080	Like there's you can't have those bodies.
3722080	3724880	You have to how do you get those bodies?
3724880	3727960	Like they don't even we stopped counting six packs.
3727960	3730040	Like that was like, like, oh, I get it.
3730040	3731360	You have to have a six pack.
3731360	3734080	And then they're like, fuck you, we're not going to count packs anymore.
3734800	3740000	That if now from now on, your torso has to look like Groot, even without CG.
3740000	3744720	It just has to be made out of fucking driftwood by a horny God.
3744720	3747160	And they've taken the normal guys.
3747760	3753440	They took Chris Pratt and like Zach Levi, who were just like slobs.
3753440	3756600	We're cast to play normal guys and made them.
3756800	3757760	Do you guys. So all right.
3757760	3762280	What's up, Chris Pratt's that like Guardian's body is like everyone was like
3762280	3765920	that CG was that that you're asking me if it was.
3768200	3770720	You came to the right place.
3770720	3772360	I want bad news, Ombre.
3772360	3775960	I don't know you you you you you you worked for Pixar
3775960	3777880	that when they did that or what?
3777880	3779400	Oh, no, no, man.
3779400	3781440	You're as all flesh and bone.
3783080	3784520	Why is this germane to you?
3784520	3786600	You're like, I'm his dog sitter.
3787760	3791480	I was one time walking into a restaurant as he was walking out.
3792040	3793120	I never believed a franchise.
3793120	3796400	Yeah, I was like, I was like, that's a silly amount of shame for us to be projecting.
3796400	3801160	I mean, I remember I saw Chris Pratt in the flesh at the at the up front
3801160	3803200	during parks and rec and community times.
3803200	3806080	And I was like, it's amazing that at one time I did
3806760	3810360	look at him as someone that, you know, maybe would play me in the biopic.
3810360	3818160	Because I mean, he looked like he was shaped like a bowling pin.
3818520	3821000	And who are we looking at now?
3821000	3822960	Yeah, who's the who do we sort of have our eye?
3822960	3825200	Oh, well, it's it's of course, Donal Logue.
3825200	3830160	He's he just he's he's playing me right now on the set of my fiance's show.
3830600	3833480	But honestly, the real answer is you and McGregor.
3833480	3836120	Obviously, if you look long enough, you'll see it.
3837760	3838760	People are like Russell Crowe.
3838760	3840920	But I'm like, like, whatever, man.
3840920	3845400	Like, like, like you're just trying to like it's it's you and McGregor.
3845400	3848360	I would go Ron Perlman for you.
3851440	3852480	He's just taking it in.
3852480	3855440	Just give him a second to just process it.
3855680	3857720	A single tear is rolling down his cheek.
3859360	3861840	There was some kind of thing with Donal Logue got cast.
3862280	3865680	Like, man, the conversations I had to listen to.
3866320	3868880	I was like, but maybe Jeff Goldblum is 90.
3868920	3871920	Like, like, like, it's like, yeah, but in all these things.
3871920	3876160	And then like, and then finally, they got they got Donal Logue.
3876160	3879720	And then who apparently his name is not Donald, it's Donal.
3880400	3882560	And also apparently Cody says we have to have him on the show
3882560	3884920	because he's like amazing and really fun.
3884920	3893880	But like he it got back to me that when he got approached for the part, he
3894760	3899400	he googled me and then asked his agent who then asked the producer who asked
3899400	3903680	Cody, who repeated this to me, because I guess she perceives me as being made of
3903680	3913360	tougher stuff. I guess I've successfully tricked her into thinking
3913360	3916560	that I am somehow self-actualized.
3918400	3923640	I guess that I guess by being on top of someone perfect and like not constantly
3923640	3926400	opting out, I guess she's like, this guy's got balls of steel.
3928160	3933600	But it's like he was like, he got the offer and then he googled me.
3933600	3937000	And then his question was like, this isn't about body type, is it?
3937000	3942680	Or something. It was like, oh, no, I say, wait, wait, wait.
3942680	3945200	So he he proceeded insults to him.
3945200	3949040	Yeah, I mean, or he wanted people to know he'd lost weight.
3949040	3951920	I don't know, man. I was like, it shouldn't have gotten back to me.
3951920	3954160	That's the only truth here.
3954160	3957960	Yeah, you're never supposed to hear about that, although it's like, yeah,
3958960	3964760	googling me being like, you'll be playing the part of what the fuck, man?
3965160	3969200	Yeah. That doesn't happen to like Winston Churchill.
3969680	3973640	Like he doesn't hear that people were like, what do I put on a suit?
3974160	3979320	And also, I mean, if he if he googles Dan Harmon body and image searches it,
3979320	3983240	he's probably getting more results than he would anticipate.
3983520	3987840	Well, to be fair, if you start typing my name, body's the first thing that comes up.
3989520	3991760	It's feet.
3991760	3994760	Um, yeah, and then a slew of stuff that.
3995760	3997920	Anyways, I know. All right.
3997920	4000320	Well, what else here we got here? Hollywood.
4000320	4003160	Hollywood. Yes, Hollywood, baby.
4004000	4008680	So can we try a Hollywood thing or is that a weird thing to have voiced upon us?
4008880	4012440	What does that mean? I mean, you know, one of the things can we do?
4013040	4014080	Well, they don't do.
4014080	4016320	We don't do anything now.
4016320	4020200	They've been trying to tell you that, you know, they're it's they don't do anything.
4020680	4024560	When we first started, we had much more of a premise to the podcast,
4024760	4029320	which it was kind of a parody of all of these shows about
4029840	4032360	becoming successful in Hollywood.
4032600	4035080	Like WTF was like the biggest show at the time.
4035360	4038560	And it was every episode was like, when did you first realize you were funny?
4038560	4042400	And so we were like doing a parody of those types of interviews
4042400	4046600	that were like at the time, 85 percent of podcasts. Yes.
4047600	4050040	Mark Maron called me a genius, dude.
4052560	4054400	He's not far off. Yeah.
4058080	4060840	He's not far off.
4062840	4064640	He's all around it.
4064640	4066840	Can I ask? I haven't listened to that episode.
4066840	4068520	Who were your guys?
4069400	4071240	Who were my guys? Yeah.
4071240	4076120	He asks everyone who the tough crowd crew, you know, Colin Quinn and
4077520	4081240	Nicky DePaul, Nicky DePee.
4081880	4086200	Yeah. But we we sort of ran out of stuff to do with that
4086200	4088200	and stopped being interested in it.
4088200	4091360	And podcasts became more broad, too.
4091360	4093720	So it wasn't as clear of like a one to one thing.
4093720	4098120	And then the show became like more abstract, I guess.
4098120	4103400	And also we started taking on much smaller targets.
4103400	4108280	Like other shows we were jealous of specifically for being more popular.
4108280	4111800	Like we would invite someone on and we would do their podcast to them
4112160	4114280	and tell them we were doing it better.
4114280	4115560	Like we had Paul of Talkas on.
4115560	4118160	We were like, how about we spontaneous you?
4118600	4121960	And then we just like made him sit through our version of his podcast.
4121960	4124760	Yeah. Paul of Talkas doesn't follow me on Instagram.
4124760	4126720	So I no longer follow him.
4126720	4134160	OK. Take me through the moment when we realize that we're like,
4134160	4137360	it was fucking rough because I was going to like for the 90th time
4137360	4140040	in my Paul F. Tompkins, please like me career.
4140480	4145480	I was about to comment on one of his Instagrams, just a totally safe fucking
4145480	4149840	like here's a bowl of fruit for the Hawaiian Easter Island fucking God
4149840	4154880	that I perceive you as just like like just reminding you I exist
4154880	4156040	and I'm in your corner.
4156040	4158640	And then I was like, you know, you see that message that's like,
4159040	4162640	there's there's some guidelines here in play, you know, like where it's like,
4162640	4166600	excuse me, sir, sir, this this this user has
4167320	4172280	has put up some fucking boundaries, you know, like now about basically
4173240	4176680	people only I think I did the same thing where you have to follow me
4176680	4178440	in order to comment.
4178440	4179640	But wait, no, that doesn't make sense.
4179640	4181480	Sometimes I think he disables comments.
4181480	4186560	I it's something like, well, whatever it is, he froze me out
4186560	4190720	and I don't care anymore because I need to I like it's not about him.
4191160	4194440	Yeah, I like one of my boys right before I got here.
4195320	4196840	I need to find my self-esteem.
4196840	4198440	And that's nobody's problem but mine.
4198440	4202920	It's it's you know, it's like he's probably smelling the desperation on me.
4202920	4206200	And like I can I maybe
4207040	4209760	he and Mark Maron have a bit of a frosty past.
4209920	4211920	He hears him call you a genius.
4211920	4215760	Yeah. And that hurts his ego.
4215760	4217960	Well, I'm positive is right now.
4217960	4220320	Shit. Can we get word to Paul F.
4220320	4223960	Tompkins that I'm positive Mark Maron hates me now as well,
4223960	4227520	just because like how would you not flow?
4229360	4232520	Because I think like we have that'll get Paul on board.
4232960	4234600	Do you have Paul's number on your phone?
4234600	4236280	What's that? Do you have Paul's number on your phone?
4236280	4237720	Yeah, but that's not fucking.
4237720	4239760	You got to leave a voicemail.
4239760	4242120	No, stop it. Yeah, this is right across the line.
4242120	4244040	And you're embarrassing me because this is a for real thing
4244040	4245800	that I'm pretending is a joke and it's for real.
4245800	4247880	And you're embarrassing me. Can I tell you?
4247880	4249520	I'm sure I'm sure he didn't.
4249520	4251440	But but I think that Paul F.
4251440	4254200	Tompkins subtweeted me because I think he follows me on Twitter.
4254440	4257880	And he was like, there's I think I think this guy.
4257920	4261720	But wow. So when when when when you follow someone,
4261720	4265720	you can see their their icon appear more often on your reactions
4265720	4266720	and mentions and stuff.
4266720	4269120	And he was like, there's some people that follow me
4269320	4274680	that never interact with any of my posts and only like posts responding to me.
4274680	4278400	And I'm like, I've done that like more than 200 times.
4278720	4282200	And so I was certain because like sometimes he just gets into it with people
4282200	4283840	and the people have really funny things to say.
4283840	4286400	And they go on these long threads and I'm like, like that, like that, like that.
4286600	4287920	But like he kicks it off.
4287920	4289960	But it's not like he's not making those jokes.
4289960	4292000	He's just making his jokes. And so I don't know.
4292000	4295520	But but I definitely I'm pretty sure that was just straight up me.
4295520	4296640	He was talking to.
4296640	4297640	This is him.
4299480	4303880	That actually and he, of course, was just an example of a person
4303880	4308160	we'd done a podcast with and didn't need to be like a subject
4308160	4312920	because like he told us right to like antagonize you on the show.
4313000	4315440	I mean, no, no, he'd have to care.
4315440	4317360	That would be flattering.
4322200	4323440	That would be amazing.
4323440	4326800	If he was if he was like, give Dan Harmon a judge, but that's what I want.
4326800	4329160	I want to we're ribbing each other.
4330800	4333440	I want to I want I.
4333440	4335400	Why did you reach out to him and bring him on the show?
4335400	4338240	Because because the whole point brought him on the show.
4338240	4341200	The whole point is that it's it's like there's nothing I can do.
4341280	4342640	I've done that.
4342640	4344680	He doesn't it.
4344680	4347520	Part of what he doesn't like about me, if I may be so
4348360	4353480	a sumptive, if that's a word, is that is this what I'm doing right now?
4353480	4357280	He doesn't want anywhere near this kind of relationship with like, I know
4357280	4361800	I know how he feels like this guy that I'm doing right now.
4361800	4365720	It's like, what is that person saying other than like a million red flags
4365720	4371400	about like, like, oh, come be part of my shenpa, my fucking sticky,
4371400	4374680	negative energy, fucking like, no, tell me you like me
4374680	4376920	because that's how I know I like myself.
4376920	4379600	Like, no, grow up and be cool.
4379600	4382280	Like Scott Ackerman and all of my earwolf friends.
4384840	4388760	And then maybe one day I'll come around when you're so fucking cool.
4389160	4391440	You know, that until you don't need it anymore.
4391440	4392440	Stop wanting it.
4392440	4396600	Then I'll be like, hey, kid, and then I'll look and you'll throw me your jersey like.
4398440	4400800	Like me, me, Joe Green and a Coca Cola ad.
4400800	4403400	Yeah, the kid wanted the jersey really bad at that.
4404120	4406240	Yeah, I think that's victim blaming.
4406240	4408240	Now, is it that?
4412520	4415400	Did did did the Pepsi?
4415400	4419400	Michael Jackson ad ripped off the the Coke mean Joe Green thing
4419400	4423520	when Michael Jackson throws the hat to the kid that he ends up raising for 30 years.
4427360	4430880	I'm going to check the children to fucking deal, right?
4431000	4434480	Some people are upset, I think, because they think Michael Jackson was innocent.
4435480	4437600	I think that's what the people in the crowd are saying.
4437600	4438600	I agree with you.
4438600	4439760	I think he's guilty.
4439760	4443120	I'm not taking a position either way, but we should talk about it for a while.
4446120	4449480	Just as a fan of positive reactions.
4449480	4450560	Yeah, come on.
4450560	4452800	I like to just collect positive reactions.
4453200	4454440	Let's talk about him.
4454440	4455280	Yeah, come on.
4455280	4457760	Let's move on to Attorney General William Barr.
4457760	4458920	Let's talk about that for a while.
4458920	4460520	Yeah, he fucked so many children.
4461000	4462000	He did.
4462000	4469080	He's fucking the children of justice, the Constitution, a fun time to be alive.
4469080	4470080	We don't have to talk about that.
4470080	4471080	Let's talk about Hollywood.
4471680	4473880	Do you guys feel bad for Liam Neeson?
4479280	4483080	I have two incredibly unpopular opinions.
4483080	4487760	Yeah, one is I've I never clicked on any I don't know, like, but I don't know.
4488080	4489080	I never clicked on any.
4489080	4492440	I don't know, like, but I just hearing the story of what happened.
4492440	4494880	I just I feel feel bad for.
4494880	4497520	OK, I thought you were talking about something else.
4498040	4499040	Go on.
4499040	4500040	Oh, his wife.
4500040	4501040	His wife dying.
4501040	4502040	His wife passed.
4502040	4503040	Continue.
4503040	4505120	Yes, we definitely did feel bad about that.
4505120	4506320	Yeah, that one was easy.
4506320	4507320	I'm on record.
4508120	4509360	Wait, that happened recently?
4509360	4510280	Not thorny at all.
4510280	4511280	No, years ago.
4511280	4512680	But Hayes can't escape it.
4512680	4513680	All right.
4514680	4515960	That's like one of his movies.
4516440	4517440	Wait, is Liam Neeson?
4517440	4518440	I can't escape.
4518440	4520480	Is Liam Neeson in the news for?
4520480	4522920	No, no, no, he got like it was a thing.
4523520	4526640	Look, he he he he was doing some morning show or something.
4526640	4527400	I didn't click on it.
4527400	4528840	I didn't see what the thing was.
4528840	4531720	But so I have to admit that that I didn't click on it.
4531720	4533120	So I only saw the headlines.
4533120	4536160	But I was like, I was like, wait, this doesn't make sense in the flowchart of how
4536160	4540200	it should work, that he was he was doing like a kind of a I'm going to call it a
4540200	4545000	Dan Harmon kind of thing where he was like, I'm so excited about how fucking
4545000	4548160	improved I am and how much I want people to like me.
4548320	4551720	I'm going to tell you that I was racist 40 years ago.
4552200	4555040	And unless you think I'm just throwing that term out.
4555200	4556240	No, for real.
4556240	4559320	Like I wanted to murder any black person at all.
4559320	4562360	Like I was in the central you know, you kind of like just told the story about how
4562360	4564440	this is like 40 years ago.
4564440	4569840	And then it was like, well, then then thanks for telling us that because now we
4569840	4574000	can hate you as opposed to like the rules that used to be where it was like, well,
4574000	4576040	thanks for telling us that because we wouldn't have known otherwise.
4576040	4578400	Therefore, we need to encourage that kind of transparency.
4578640	4579240	So right.
4579240	4581320	So here's a here's a medal.
4581320	4582080	Not really.
4582080	4583640	But can I ask you something, though?
4583640	4585520	So you have this opinion.
4585520	4587080	It's a very unpopular opinion.
4589440	4592360	And yet you still haven't clicked on it.
4592360	4592720	Right.
4592720	4593200	Got it.
4594040	4596040	And I'll point this out.
4596040	4598840	This wasn't like that recently.
4598840	4600520	You've you have had time.
4600520	4601720	I keep thinking about it.
4602080	4604800	Well, I've been compiling a list of unpopular opinions.
4605560	4608160	One is that I think the Blues Brothers movie is overrated.
4608160	4612400	Like I just I'm like, yeah, I got to agree with you there.
4612400	4613760	They're singing and stuff.
4613760	4615080	Is this is this funny?
4615080	4621440	I don't I think that I think you cannot crack up when you hear the iconic line.
4621440	4624360	We're on a mission from God.
4624360	4629600	I look at listen to the laugh that got this place is fucking burning down.
4630320	4633600	But then, but then a recent Franklin comes out and says, you better think.
4633600	4634480	And it's pretty fucking good.
4634480	4636400	Like there's good musical moments in it.
4636400	4638240	But yeah, it might be.
4638240	4640640	But why do you want to read one, frankly?
4640640	4642800	Yeah, why do we need these guys?
4642800	4646240	Every I think it's I think it's high time that five white guys
4646240	4648360	weighed in on jazz music and then saw.
4648360	4651360	OK, but can we weigh in on two other white guys doing it?
4651480	4655080	Yeah. Yeah, that high road is a medium.
4655080	4657040	Our jazz music.
4657040	4658280	They're off limits now.
4658280	4659800	The Blues Brothers.
4659800	4662320	For me, you got fucking Ray Charles and you got a reason.
4662320	4663640	Like, that's that's pretty groovy.
4663640	4667640	I think that it probably was a movie that when everyone saw it, it was like, wow,
4667640	4669960	this must have been so fun to be a part of people.
4669960	4673240	And it felt like it was like cool on set or something.
4673240	4675800	And then it gets remembered as what a great movie.
4675800	4678840	But if you just sit down and watch the movie for what the movie is,
4679400	4680480	it's not that funny.
4680480	4683000	I yeah. OK, thank you.
4683000	4688880	And even even less explicable is the sketch on SNL.
4689920	4691760	It was. What was that?
4691760	4693800	I mean, I I understand.
4693800	4696800	Like, I feel like I feel insulted with my people's responses
4696800	4701240	because their responses are always to explain to me as if I there's
4701280	4705720	I don't understand that it was possible that there was a time
4705720	4708640	when people felt this way or that way.
4708640	4711240	I'm like, that's not comedy.
4711240	4713800	You're not telling me like I understand that.
4713800	4716320	I read like I read the oral history of Saturday Night Live.
4716320	4717800	I do understand.
4717800	4721400	And I think it's really cool that I read the headline
4721400	4726520	that John Belushi, who looks nothing like any fucking leading man.
4726520	4729840	I mean, this is like like before there even was a fat dude market.
4729840	4731440	I mean, there wasn't even that.
4731440	4733360	And he looks like John Belushi.
4733360	4737240	And like this this variety show at midnight on Saturday produced
4737240	4741400	by this crazy hippie, this and all these like Second City people.
4741400	4742840	And it's this fucking like awesome.
4742840	4745960	And Dan Aykroyd's got the Asperger's and they don't have a word for it yet.
4745960	4750120	And like that he and Belushi like had this intersection where they're like
4750120	4753440	they both love old blues music and like for real loved it
4753440	4755920	and like didn't punch down on it. We're like super into it.
4755920	4760240	And that America was like, yeah, comedy is so possible
4760240	4765720	to also be kind of sexy and fun and subversive that I choose to love this.
4765720	4768040	That's part of the joke and sort of I get all that.
4768040	4769240	I like the movie now.
4769240	4773960	But unfortunately, you're making a great issue of like there's I think now now.
4773960	4775680	Now let me propose an alternative.
4775680	4779520	Watch the movie airplane by the Zucker brothers.
4779520	4783160	I mean, Jesus Christ, there's a lot of fucking jokes in that movie.
4783160	4788880	And 40 percent of them are now racist, but they all still register as jokes.
4788880	4790680	Yeah. It's like, OK, set up punchline.
4790680	4793200	And then it's like and you could kind of like, I don't know.
4793200	4796720	Like I just kind of just a part of me that resents.
4796720	4799520	Liam Neeson loves that movie.
4799520	4804280	That I have to tell you, there's a guy I used to love the Blues brothers.
4805760	4808160	I loved it so much.
4808160	4812200	I saw the movie, but I just wanted to beat a minority to death.
4813720	4815520	I'm just putting that out there.
4815520	4817920	Hope I hope honesty is still the best policy.
4819600	4822040	Dan Harmon told me it was.
4822040	4824760	Well, I got news for you, old timer.
4825440	4826720	You're going to the who scout.
4826720	4829080	Wait, no, I have a particular set of skills.
4829920	4832000	Hey, did you guys see Cold Pursuit?
4832000	4833200	I haven't seen it.
4833200	4835000	It's worth watching.
4835000	4836840	I watch it with Cody.
4836840	4840320	I'm like, your money doesn't go to racism like like.
4841560	4843680	It's it's it's it's interesting.
4843680	4846480	Yeah, it's it's a it's a it's a weird.
4846480	4847560	Jan Harmon raves.
4847560	4849400	It's worth watching.
4849400	4851560	I mean, that is my rave these days.
4851560	4852320	Yeah, for sure.
4852320	4855920	Like like most movies I was speaking to blues and brothers.
4856320	4860160	I was at the fucking drawing room on a karaoke last Sunday and a dude.
4861040	4864600	I saw him sitting in the booth and he had a harmonica that he brought
4865080	4869000	and he was warming up on the harmonica in a restaurant at the drawing room
4869640	4871200	in the bar at the bar.
4871200	4872280	And it was karaoke night.
4872280	4875920	And yes, he was fucking warming up to fucking lay down a little fucking harp.
4876200	4879160	Was that one of those ones that was he wearing it with like the metal?
4879480	4883440	No, he's like, even though he doesn't have a guitar, he's just like,
4885560	4887240	it's a it's a tesla harmonica.
4887240	4890680	That'd be great if he had the harmonica rig at the air guitar
4890720	4891760	while he was doing it.
4891760	4894760	But he got up there and played fucking harmonica.
4894760	4897920	And the the crowd was a fucking downright mutinous.
4898280	4902720	Nobody, nobody wanted anyone to fucking bring their own harmonica.
4902760	4906840	I can I can I can I can I can I even though you would think
4906840	4909920	I said my antipathy toward the antipathy for the scooters
4910440	4912000	where I'm like, oh, you're just overreacting.
4912000	4913600	But it's like they were there.
4913600	4916760	They know, you know, like I trust them.
4917160	4919720	Who? The crowd, the crowd, the beauty.
4919720	4922400	I like I'm like, don't don't bring props to karaoke.
4922400	4925760	No, don't don't. I feel like when at least
4925760	4928400	let it be a surprise when you're up there.
4928400	4930840	Pull out of your pocket during like the instrumental.
4930880	4931640	That would be amazing.
4931640	4933200	It's like you did a Bob Dylan song.
4933200	4936360	And then during the musical interlude, you like whipped it out of your pocket
4936360	4941080	or do you like I people would be like fucking
4941400	4943240	this motherfucker is warming up in the fucking booth.
4943240	4947080	All that's not is this guy going to fucking do a Bob Dylan song.
4947080	4949040	I'll mix it up. I'm on this guy's side.
4949040	4953120	I mean, you're a karaoke to hear another person's
4953120	4955760	shitty version of a song that was done well before.
4955760	4957520	Who cares? They're fucking singing it wrong.
4957520	4961240	Nobody, nobody wants to hear somebody's fucking harmonic.
4961240	4962720	You're not. Was he bad?
4962720	4964520	Yes. OK.
4965520	4969800	The purpose of karaoke isn't to hear a song like Sean,
4969800	4972960	name your favorite harmonica player and why you hesitates.
4973320	4977120	Why does he say pauper, pauper, pauper?
4977120	4979960	And that's why we're a team.
4979960	4983280	My man never lets me, but he's your city hall body man.
4983400	4985040	He's got five harmonica.
4985040	4986800	So he just you didn't believe that.
4986800	4988640	You don't love that guy's harmonica.
4988640	4990960	I like the song The Hook. I think it's funny.
4990960	4993360	Yeah, come on. Run around the hook. Yeah.
4994160	4996360	Neil Young plays a mean harmonica,
4996840	4999080	but he doesn't bring it to fucking karaoke.
4999080	5002520	No, but he brings it to the last waltz and he's playing it up there.
5002520	5003920	Yeah, because it's fucking Neil Young.
5003920	5004960	Yeah, exactly.
5004960	5006640	Maybe this guy's the next Neil Young.
5006640	5008520	Well, it must be kind of crazy.
5008520	5014040	Do you think there are prisoners that still like, like, like,
5014040	5016440	how do you think a prison reacts?
5016440	5017480	They feel patient.
5017480	5020040	You just on the on C block, it's midnight.
5020040	5023280	And then like the new guy or he's been there six months
5023280	5028000	and you just hear like her, her and then like the oldest guy goes, no, no.
5029480	5031000	Don't. Yeah.
5031000	5034520	You have to open up with what's the Richard Pryor,
5034520	5039320	Gina, Gina Wilder one stir crazy way down in the valley.
5039960	5043520	The guy breaks out the fucking perfect harmonica and it's beautiful.
5043680	5046520	I have a harmonica story.
5047440	5052480	So I'm trying to play you off.
5054400	5055920	That was my intro music to harmonica.
5055920	5060240	So I went to see maybe this will get groans, I don't know,
5060240	5063760	but I went to see Dave Chappelle and John Mayer perform.
5065280	5068040	They did like a tour together where like Job Bear played
5068040	5069920	like three job air songs that Dave Chappelle did,
5069920	5073280	like 40 minutes of stand up and then they just like hung out on stage together.
5073520	5074280	I think we love it.
5074280	5076040	John Mayer is a friend of the podcast.
5076040	5081120	We just so you guys know, going forward,
5081120	5084040	like when you go outside the earwolf, well, there's other famous people.
5084040	5086880	Great. Yeah, I played tennis with him once.
5086880	5091160	So I so I met. Yes, one on one.
5092520	5094280	We played doubles, actually.
5094280	5097640	Same same side or rivals rivals. OK. Yeah.
5097640	5100000	And can I ask what the scoreline was at the end?
5100000	5103080	We fucking tuned him up, man.
5104760	5106880	I don't know what that means, but I think that means you won.
5106880	5109360	Yeah, he called me a comedy bully.
5110640	5113000	So I think you're like a comedy guy beating our ass.
5113000	5115960	What would you say is John Mayer's weakness and doubles tennis?
5116920	5119520	An inability to play well.
5119520	5122560	Wow. It's a lack of experience is what it is.
5122840	5125160	He seemed like he was just learning the game.
5125160	5127920	But when I went to see him with Dave Chappelle, at a certain point,
5127920	5130960	they Dave said, I'm going to bring out our friend Fred.
5130960	5134240	Now, Fred used to be in Prince's band and he used to tour with them.
5134720	5136840	And he's going to play harmonica for us.
5136840	5140080	And John Mayer played Purple Rain on the guitar.
5140280	5143320	And Fred did the vocal with the harmonica.
5143320	5146000	Oh, my God. And it was fucking awesome.
5146200	5149000	Because it's like there, you know, there's these notes up there that would,
5149440	5151280	you know, very few people can sing.
5151280	5155760	But when he was like just hitting it, so Fred did all the vocals for Purple Rain.
5155800	5160680	He did. He he with the harmonica, like played the what the vocal melody would be.
5160880	5163040	But like holding these sustained notes and like
5163800	5165800	friends, the guy that I assume in
5167200	5170120	I was dreaming when I wrote this, what's that song?
5170160	5171960	1999. Like that.
5171960	5176320	I'm assuming Fred's the guy that goes, well, life is just a party
5176320	5179000	and parties was meant to last.
5179200	5183280	That's got to be Fred because it's the only non prince male like voice.
5183320	5185440	I think so. Yeah.
5185440	5187760	But it was it was really good.
5187760	5191160	And I was like, oh, harmonica can be pretty cool. Interesting.
5192160	5194080	I'm sorry. I don't even understand.
5194080	5198920	Like I I guess I understand like pianos are buttons that you press.
5198920	5200880	So that's like a lot like a typewriter.
5200880	5202440	So I get that.
5202440	5204400	I can't. What's happening with the harmonica?
5204400	5205560	Yeah, the guitar.
5205560	5208280	Then you can like make my brain stretch and go like, OK,
5208280	5211400	you block certain strings from going all the way.
5211400	5214720	And it's like it just seems like you're asking for trouble.
5216480	5218920	And I guess you're doing the same thing with a fiddle.
5218920	5221840	But like you're instead of plucking, you're stroking.
5222240	5224840	And and yeah, you got a bunch of holes.
5224840	5226720	Like I don't have to describe all musical instruments for you.
5227840	5230960	But wait, no, back up.
5230960	5234200	That's like you do understand the flute, but not the harmonica.
5234600	5236200	Well, I don't understand the flute.
5236200	5238360	Well, yeah, I do, because there's buttons like a typewriter.
5238640	5242000	So you blow, you blow into the flute and then you type to.
5242120	5244680	You do boop, boop, boop, boop.
5244680	5250080	Fade in and then this happens, you know, call to adventure across the threshold.
5250080	5252000	Then you go down and boom, boom.
5252000	5253120	Where's season four?
5253120	5257240	Our amount of is basically a harmonic is like a little piano, like an octave or two
5257520	5260560	that you just blow in and out and you get you get the white and the black keys.
5260560	5263480	How do you play the piano?
5264960	5267280	Whoa. Oh, you did it, man.
5267520	5270160	Oh, she's going to blow into the piano, Aunty!
5270160	5276820	We're currently out of the Hollywood Handbook, but I remember my grandpa, World
5276820	5283780	War II veteran grandpa, who he had like a harmonica that he would play once in a
5283780	5287500	while. I think he learned to play it in the in the Marines when he was just
5287500	5292180	hanging out in the stuff you see in the thin red line. My grandpa was there, but
5292180	5296500	John Cusack wasn't in real life. It was just like 17 year old dudes like hanging
5296500	5302580	out smoking cigarettes, and he had a harmonica from back then, and he could
5302580	5307180	play it. It was like somehow he learned during his days in the war to play it,
5307180	5312280	and I remember him explaining that you use your tongue to block some of the
5312280	5319020	holes. Crazy, crazy instrument. Anybody here have a harmonica on the Marines?
5319020	5325860	Yeah, I think we would have heard it by now. Yeah. Because I can play O. Susanna. If
5325860	5330100	you get a harmonica, you can play O. Susanna. Does anybody have a harmonica? Come on.
5330100	5336380	Somebody's holding out. Can you chain harmonica? Come on. Everyone's got to die 20. No one's got a
5336380	5346320	harmonica. It's Hollywood, baby. Somebody's got a harmonica. Oh, life is just a part of him, but his
5346320	5353360	was meant to last. You kind of went like a little Chris Christofferson on that one.
5353360	5362000	Catch you fuckers at a bad time. This flashlight shines ultraviolet rays. Well,
5362000	5373080	this bullet's tipped with sodium nitrate garlic. It's garlic. This here's a bullet.
5373320	5380360	These bullets are cased with chemical sodium. He's doing garlic. Chris Christofferson from Blade,
5380360	5387080	everybody. Oh, yeah. That's garlic. He does the whole thing. He's like, come on,
5387080	5392200	Blade. Come on over here. I'm going to show you some shit. Can I catch you fuckers at a bad time?
5392760	5399240	This flashlight shines 250 watts of solid UV radiation. Sunlight.
5402760	5410520	These bullets are tipped in canola oil combined with sodium pentathol traces of lysergic fiber.
5410520	5421880	Garlic. These two pieces of wood are at an actual perpendicular angular. It's a cross.
5421880	5432920	No, no, no. It's more like these defibrillators send a sonic frequency identical to cuneiferous
5433720	5448680	vegetation. Wood. Clear. Oh, a sonic tree. God damn. I can't believe how cool you made
5448680	5452840	Killing Vampires. It's a great movie. You won't catch me saying Blade's not good.
5452840	5458520	Blade's great. That's fun. David S. Goyer would make a great guest. Book him.
5459000	5463640	David S. Goyer, screenwriter. You don't have to nod, Zach. Can we get Wesley Snipes on the show?
5463640	5471480	Zach's like, uh-huh. On it. Do you want to beat? Do you want to brainstorm bests for a while?
5471480	5475480	No, I want David S. Goyer. Okay, I'll work on that, too. I'm just waiting for you to want to beat.
5476760	5483800	I think Steve said we booked Jerry Springer. Jerry Springer. Yeah, this is such great kismet.
5483880	5490040	I mean, I was at the drawing room, and if you're there before noon, which I'm sure I wasn't.
5491560	5498360	Jerry Springer will be on the TV, and I was like, how do we even know this guy? Has he stopped
5498360	5503320	making these episodes? What's he doing? And I was familiar enough that his story is kind of
5503320	5508200	winding and interesting to the point where I'm like, I don't want him to die doing the Jerry
5508200	5512600	Springer show. And I was wondering, how long has he been doing it? Sorry for my gross fucking
5513240	5522440	gastro burps. We'll edit those out. I Wikipedia'd him, and it's like he just stopped. He just
5522440	5529640	finished doing the Jerry Springer show, and he's getting ready to do his Judge Jerry show. He has
5529640	5536040	a podcast, and I texted Levy and was like, can we get Jerry Springer as a guest? Because if you read
5536040	5542280	his Wikipedia page, every single, every third sentence, you'll be like, how come this isn't a
5542280	5548680	biopic? His family escaped the Holocaust. Most of his ancestors were annihilated during the Holocaust.
5548680	5553480	He was born during the Blitz? Yeah, absolutely. That's the really funny thing. His mother gave
5553480	5560120	birth to him during... Not funny. Funny, the weird. His mother gave birth to him during the bombings
5560120	5567320	in the tomb. In the subway, yeah. And all of his... Basically, all of his family tree,
5568520	5576440	this is probably an exaggeration. You get the impression that every single one of what would
5576440	5584840	have been an expansive family tree instead became a funnel into one twig, which is Jerry Springer,
5584840	5592200	because of the Holocaust. Everyone got wiped out except for this little baby. What was it like?
5592200	5596520	Yeah, something like that. And then he was mayor of Cincinnati, but that's even a fascinating story.
5596520	5602120	He invented the typewriter? Boris Gump is sort of based loosely on Jerry Springer.
5603560	5610040	Just sort of touched everything. He also did a recent episode called Babes with Baguettes,
5610520	5613640	because they couldn't say chicks with dicks. Babes.
5620520	5622120	That's good stuff. Is that better?
5624120	5626360	Well, you can't not say it. People don't get mad, and they're like,
5626360	5632920	what? I'm kind of curious, does he still, as of episode 5500, where it was clearly just,
5632920	5636120	all I ever see is it with the volume down, I'll just look up and see like,
5636760	5643240	why is everyone dressed like Snoopy? You'll just look up and see some ridiculous
5644680	5651480	comedic adult art play going on with wigs flying around and pineal shoes as propellers.
5651480	5655800	If you look up his biography, he's quite intellectual. He's a very...
5657960	5662360	Well, that's what I wonder. When I would watch Jerry Springer when I was in my 20s,
5662360	5668360	and I would get high with my vegan hippie girlfriend, and it was ironic enough to watch
5668360	5673960	anything on TV. We were eating vegan sandwiches, and we were just like, oh, what's on? Jerry
5673960	5679480	Springer, it's three in the afternoon. I'm 20. I hate watching it, but whatever.
5680280	5684440	What I remember from that show back then was the Springer final thoughts,
5684440	5689080	which were inconceivably well-written. I don't know who was writing those things.
5689160	5695560	Probably him, the bodyguard guy, maybe. It was the weirdest thing. You remember Springer's
5695560	5698760	final thoughts? Yeah, sure. Steve got his own show, right? Yeah, Wilco's.
5699400	5705160	But did he keep doing those? Because I look up and I'll just see a man in a wedding dress
5705160	5711080	punching a mouse, and I'll just see it with the volume down, and I'll like, does he still,
5711080	5717480	at the end of that episode, go, transformation is... You need to respect people, or did he...
5717560	5721800	Does he recycle his final thoughts? Yeah. Is he like, we kind of covered this ground before...
5721800	5725320	Yeah, punching a mouse is also a lot like learning clarinet.
5725320	5730920	I bet they haven't stopped trying to fill time on that show after 25 years,
5730920	5735080	so I'm guessing that he still does do that. Why is there that weird fan? There's that weird
5735080	5737800	industrial... Oh, yeah, there's your hand.
5737800	5744520	It's like you're in a basement. You're aware you can trust that the street justice is...
5744760	5747080	You're in the third act of the third man with Orson Welles.
5748520	5751240	You're away from the prying eyes of our already corrupt system.
5753480	5758760	You're in Fagan's hideout, you know? It's like, look, this pickpocket asked for more soup.
5758760	5761640	Get him! I never read Oliver Twist.
5764200	5767000	I believe Fagan had a hideout in the sewer. You absorbed a lot.
5767000	5772760	He pitted you against... But I think that we're led to believe that we're in some sort of underground
5773400	5776040	fight club kind of thing where... For sure, yeah.
5776040	5778200	That might need to be dried off quickly in a pinch.
5780280	5782760	Fire up that fan and kind of point it at the floor.
5782760	5787800	That could be... I'm gonna clear the courtroom. He might threaten the entire audience before
5787800	5795400	the cameras roll. I have in my hand a button, and that fan works and will suck all organic material
5796600	5799000	and shoot it through a cannon across the Atlantic.
5799240	5806840	He escaped annihilation from the German Holocaust of Jews, and he made it to Chicago and became
5807880	5812840	almost a senator, right? He ran for governor or mayor and... I think governor, yeah.
5812840	5816360	He was a decent politician. Here's something really interesting about his political career
5816360	5823320	that I saw on his Wikipedia page. Before the mayor of Cincinnati thing, he got interested
5823320	5829480	in politics, and then there was this... He got arrested with a... There was a sex worker
5830440	5836440	scandal that kind of marred him. He wrote a check. He paid for a sex work
5836440	5842520	with a personal check. But it wasn't... He didn't pay for it with taxpayers' money. He
5842520	5847080	didn't pay for it with campaign funds. I don't know if he was married. Maybe that was his crime,
5847160	5855400	he was unfaithful. But it was a scandal, as per The Times. But the interesting thing is that he
5859880	5864120	was a thing subsequent to that, where he wanted to run for another thing.
5864920	5875160	I think governor, maybe. And his campaign was using that check, and his slogan was like,
5875960	5879080	something like, you can count on me to... I got nothing to hide.
5879080	5882760	Or something like, I'll tell the truth even if it hurts.
5882760	5884600	I'll tell the truth even if it hurts. That's exactly what it was.
5886040	5892120	This guy's singing my song. I just want him to be happy. I don't want him to
5893000	5898440	Robert Altman die on a set. I want him to die on Joseph Campbell on a porch somewhere.
5898440	5901640	He's done enough. Joseph Campbell died on a porch?
5901640	5907640	Yeah. As you should. Was it his porch or somebody else's porch?
5907640	5913640	Of course it was his porch. Whose porch do you think you're supposed to die on?
5913640	5916840	Joseph Campbell could have died on anybody's porch. You could have died on Carl Young's porch.
5916840	5922200	I don't know. Don't die on another person's porch. That's what a mummy does.
5924120	5929880	Let's face it, that's rude. That's a ghost story. New rules.
5932600	5939000	Die on your own porch. Yeah, but how badass would it be to die on somebody else's porch?
5939000	5944280	All right. Well, you're always in it for the thrill. You're going to get to be my age
5944280	5946440	three months from now. When I die on your porch, you're going,
5946440	5952120	oh, fuck, he did it. If you die on my porch, I'm going to high-five your corpse.
5952120	5955160	You're going to wake up. You're going to be going to a meeting in the morning and you're
5955160	5960120	going to see a dead Jeff Davis on your porch. You go, the fucking guy died on my porch.
5960920	5964200	How do you guys want to die? I'm picturing him finding you
5964200	5969160	just kind of falling out of your car in front of his house. And you tried to get over there.
5969160	5973400	If you had to die, didn't quite make it. Hayes, if you had to die on someone's porch,
5975160	5977400	other than your own, whose porch would you like to be dead on?
5977400	5982440	I know my man here is thinking he's got a great porch, and you really do.
5982440	5985800	Oh, yeah. I'd be pretty offended if Hayes didn't say my porch.
5986760	5989160	That was my first thought. And of course, since I've already stated
5989160	5993640	that dying on someone else's porch is rude, you know I'm dying on the porch of the orange buffoon.
5994360	5996440	Oh, nice. The Cheeto and Chief.
5999800	6005160	Let's all die on the Capitol steps. That's right. I'm marching right up to the White House.
6007000	6009480	I'm dying on the porch of Mar-a-Lago.
6009560	6013560	Wait, speak of the Capitol steps. Dan, I sent you a message.
6013560	6016840	Yeah, I know. Dan and I hate the
6017960	6021880	comedy satire group, and I use all those words in fucking quotations.
6022920	6029160	The Capitol steps might be the worst. They're playing in Pasadena.
6029160	6032280	We kind of have to go there, right? What do they do now?
6033400	6038600	Like, that question was viable back in the dangling Chad days. I was like,
6038600	6043240	okay, this is all too funny now in parodies itself. Now, what do they do?
6043240	6046120	Well, sometimes you're a Nazi and you don't want to be one.
6047000	6049480	Like, what are their parody songs about?
6050280	6052920	I mean, lots of stuff rhymes with Bill Barr. Yeah.
6053560	6055080	Probably personalities. Yeah.
6055080	6057160	Yeah. I guess it's just the same. I guess it's the same old thing.
6057160	6059160	It doesn't, it always boils down to that anyway.
6059160	6059880	Like, yeah.
6059880	6062760	Fucking Capitol steps. I want to fucking punch all of them.
6062760	6065160	Ice. There's a lot of funny stuff you can do with ice.
6066040	6067160	Ice baby.
6067160	6067960	Oh, yeah.
6067960	6069960	Like, like ice, like putting it. Yeah.
6069960	6071640	I say they had to burn that right away.
6071640	6072520	Yeah. Yeah.
6072520	6074440	They're probably, they're probably trying to figure out how to.
6074440	6074760	Yeah. Yeah.
6074760	6078040	Ice, ice, baby. Because they lock up babies in the cages.
6078040	6080120	But yeah, it's fucking perfect.
6081000	6084840	Yeah. Do you think they have standards where they're like, oh, it's too soon or it's too
6084840	6088920	sensitive? That's, I guess that's my big question is like, politics are no longer
6089720	6092840	like, it's like, you can't really. Yeah.
6092840	6095320	Did they like, oh, we're not going to do that because,
6095320	6099320	well, we'll be, I got a great rhyme for that, but someone will start crying.
6099320	6104280	No, no. I'm pretty sure that one of the Capitol steps comes out with a diaper on
6104280	6106760	and he goes, I'm an ice, ice baby.
6106760	6109640	And they're, they're locked up and they're at the border.
6109640	6111560	I guarantee that's a fucking thing.
6111560	6113960	I have a lot of friends in the Capitol steps.
6113960	6114360	No, you don't.
6115720	6116920	Not a lot, three.
6116920	6117160	Okay.
6118440	6121640	And they have a policy, which is, yes, they'll say something is too soon,
6121720	6123240	which means we have to do it.
6124040	6124680	Nice.
6124680	6124920	Yeah.
6126280	6130520	That's, that's the Bruckheimer school. That's, that's when he did Con Air.
6131400	6133000	What was that? That happened?
6133000	6134120	Yeah. Con Air happened.
6134120	6135880	It was too close to a convict.
6137320	6140040	Killing everyone on the plane on the Las Vegas strip.
6140040	6140920	I don't remember that.
6140920	6142520	There was a real Con Air.
6142520	6143000	Oh.
6143000	6146760	And Bruckheimer was like, too soon. Let's do it.
6146760	6147240	Wow.
6147720	6148120	Whoa.
6150600	6152120	Dave Chappelle in that movie.
6152760	6153320	Oh yeah.
6156040	6156920	I've never seen it.
6156920	6159480	Also, it's a, it's a, it's a, you haven't seen it now.
6159480	6160200	Saw the trailer.
6160200	6161400	Can I, can I tell you?
6161400	6162360	Worth watching.
6162360	6162840	Yeah.
6162840	6167960	I've heard, I've heard somebody was talking about that movie like is such a,
6167960	6170360	they should make a movie about that movie because clearly
6171400	6173400	so many things happened on that set.
6173960	6179240	So many things changed about everyone, like everyone that showed up to that set.
6179800	6183720	Like it was like, it was like, uh, like people coming, uh, who's,
6183720	6186600	all their cars breaking down outside a haunted house or something.
6186600	6189480	Like it was just like, like everything changed on that set.
6189480	6190440	Oh yeah.
6190440	6192520	God. I wish I could remember Nick Cage's name.
6192520	6197400	I know one of the prisoners gets introduced and they go AKA diamond dog.
6199000	6199960	Diamond dog?
6199960	6202040	Yeah. They, yeah. He's got a name.
6202040	6205320	I don't know what that name is, but then they say AKA diamond dog.
6205320	6207240	Because he's a big, like David Bowie fan.
6207240	6208680	Huge Bowie fan. Yeah.
6212440	6221080	John Kuzak is driving around on the ground in that movie because he knows that John Kuzak's a cop.
6222040	6223400	He's a good guy.
6223400	6224760	Is he like a librarian?
6224760	6229400	He's in communication with Nick Cage, who's a convict with a heart of gold.
6229400	6233240	And he's just trying to get home to his daughter and he wants to bring her this stuffed bunny.
6233240	6238360	And if that other convict doesn't put the bunny down, as he famously says in the movie,
6238360	6239880	he's going to kill him. And he does.
6240760	6244360	So Nick Cage doesn't want con air to be hijacked.
6244360	6248920	Right. Cause he's a good guy. He's only in jail because his hands are deadly weapons, I think.
6248920	6255240	And so he kills someone and, uh, he's out of the bar fight, like defending someone's honor and then
6255240	6255880	wound up killing.
6255880	6259960	And so he doesn't want, but in order to see, but he, so he doesn't want,
6259960	6263000	I'm sorry, I keep asking the same question, but like he definitely does not want.
6263960	6266040	No, he's a good guy. Like he was in the army.
6266040	6270760	He wants to do his time. He wants to pay his debt to society.
6270760	6273560	Because he's about, he's going home. I think like he's out.
6273560	6276440	I think he's out of prison.
6276440	6278280	Funny for his daughter. He's going home.
6278280	6280120	His reaction is basically, oh brother.
6282120	6283640	So that's how that was the impetus of the movie.
6283720	6290120	It was like, oh, con air, it, it transports criminals. And some of them are like,
6291320	6294840	I did it. And then they look around and they're like, these guys, right?
6294840	6297960	I don't want to be a plant. Yeah. Like, oh, brother.
6297960	6300840	They'd love for this plane to, to they've, they'll probably,
6300840	6303000	they're probably going to deactivate the smoke detectors.
6303000	6304600	Yeah. Good gravy.
6306120	6307720	Yeah. Oh my goodness.
6308280	6311560	Imagine me being in the position of a goodie, goodie.
6312200	6316040	After, after all this time, I, yeah, I get it now.
6316040	6318200	That's a great movie. I'm going to kick ass.
6319400	6322600	So, so what's, what's the, the crisis? What's the meeting with the goddess?
6322600	6325000	Like for, for Nick Cage.
6325000	6327000	Oh geez. Thank you for asking.
6328440	6330680	Well, I'm okay. They're in the, okay.
6330680	6331960	Let's, well, let's, so, okay.
6331960	6335160	It's a movie about convicts getting on an airplane.
6335160	6336760	Hence the title con air.
6336760	6338600	Some are going away for a good long time.
6338600	6339880	Some are just trying to get through it.
6340360	6342680	Okay. They're all, it's like a cast of misfits.
6342680	6345640	Somebody on the plane, I would have assumed Nick Cage, but now I'm here.
6345640	6348120	Okay. So there's someone else on the plane who's like a bad guy.
6348120	6349240	Who's like, got a plan.
6349240	6350520	Is it John Malkovich?
6350520	6351720	Modern equivalent of your watch.
6354920	6357400	I just got to know what Nick Cage's name is in this movie.
6357400	6360200	Is it John, is it John Malkovich who is the bad guy?
6360200	6362760	He's one of the bad guys. I don't think who's the main bad guy.
6362760	6365400	I don't think he's the guy who actually kicks it off, but he might've been.
6366120	6368920	So I mean, I would, it's like, I know this isn't going to be the case,
6368920	6370520	but if it's a, it's a Bruckheimer movie.
6370520	6373000	So I want John Cusack to not be a cop.
6373000	6375160	I want John Cusack to be something one off a cop.
6375160	6380040	Like he's a veterinarian or a, like a biographer who, who's like,
6380040	6382440	it's like, I just need to write.
6382440	6383160	I write.
6383160	6386600	I need one chapter from Nicholas Cage's character when he lands.
6386600	6390120	And then like, somehow he's roped into like profiling or something.
6390120	6390920	But it's like, okay.
6390920	6393000	So, so they're getting on the plane.
6393000	6396520	So page 25 is going to be the hijacking of the plane.
6397080	6401080	Uh, so then your question is what happens on page 60?
6401080	6406280	The answer is going to be the convicts are officially in charge of where the plane is going.
6406280	6406600	Right.
6406600	6406840	Yeah.
6408120	6411400	Where is our Nick Cage is our protagonist, right?
6411400	6413480	Uh, Cameron Poe on the plane.
6413480	6415000	This is, this is a two hander.
6415000	6416280	It's a buddy comedy.
6416280	6419560	Okay. So, so he, but he's, uh, not a comedy, a buddy.
6419560	6420840	He's Bruce Willis inside.
6420840	6421880	Not gonna tell me Plaza.
6422760	6424120	What's his name? Cyrus, the virus.
6424200	6426360	Salkovich is named Cyrus, the virus.
6427000	6428520	Ving Rhames is diamond dog.
6429240	6431160	I believe he's kind of a good guy too.
6431160	6434920	Ving Rhames is another guy, by the way, who's like eternally 48.
6434920	6439000	Like they find a Ving Rhames movie where he's 20.
6439000	6440440	Cusack's a U.S. Marshall.
6440440	6442120	U.S. Marshall, Vince Larkin.
6442120	6444440	Um, so yeah, but, but I care.
6444440	6448360	It sounds like 60 minutes into the movie, if it's two hours myth, you know, whatever,
6448360	6452920	but like half halfway point of the movie means that the convicts are now flying the plane.
6453720	6456840	Is he on the convict side or on the side of the law at this point?
6456840	6458520	He's probably trying to play both sides.
6458520	6459400	Playing both sides.
6459400	6459720	Right.
6459720	6461960	He's got to, he's got to get home to his daughter.
6462760	6465080	Yeah. He's got to do whatever is going to get him home safe.
6467000	6470840	And if that means letting Cyrus, the virus, who's an evil genius,
6471560	6474200	believe for a moment that maybe he's on the side of the convicts,
6474200	6475320	well, then that's what he's going to do.
6476120	6481400	And here's where I'd ask, how is he in contact with the, his buddy in this buddy cop movie?
6481400	6486360	But I already know because the conversation I had with this friend who was telling me
6486360	6490840	they should make a movie about that movie is the part where Dave Dave Chappelle is.
6492600	6497240	A note is attached to his body and he's thrown out of the airplane.
6497240	6501480	His body lands on a car and the note is still legible.
6503320	6507240	Because if a human body falls from a plane and lands hilariously on
6507240	6512680	probably some douchebags car, he's like, it's like the guy's like some, yeah, he's like,
6512680	6516440	Hey, I'm sure he's like telling a valet.
6516440	6522040	Like, if I see one fucking scratch on that thing, I'm going to do even more cocaine.
6522760	6523720	Come on, girls.
6525400	6526520	We don't want to go.
6526520	6527960	You don't get agency.
6528680	6529640	Smash.
6530600	6531480	What the fuck?
6533400	6534520	That's my car.
6534520	6536040	And then Kuzak pulls up.
6536120	6536760	Librarian.
6536760	6538200	To your U.S. marshal, Vince Larkin.
6538200	6538700	Yeah.
6541560	6543800	It's written in teddy bear hair.
6544520	6547480	I'm on flight 740, aka the jail bird.
6548680	6550520	The convicts have taken over the plane.
6550520	6554360	So then it's a matter of like, it's a mystery where they're going.
6554360	6555160	I bet.
6555160	6557800	It's like a race to figure out where they're going to try to land.
6557800	6558920	He's got a plan, yeah.
6558920	6562440	So the goddess is probably Chappelle hitting the car.
6562440	6565800	That's probably the meeting with the goddess because it's the truth
6565800	6567800	that you didn't know you were seeking.
6567800	6569800	Do you think you wouldn't be able to read the note
6569800	6571000	if somebody got thrown from a plane?
6571000	6571560	Dave Chappelle?
6572520	6573320	No, I mean like.
6575720	6578200	Do you think that if someone was thrown from a plane with a note attached?
6578200	6578680	No, I don't.
6578680	6580440	You just seemed skeptical that you'd be able to.
6580440	6583160	Yeah, I believe that no one feels like their body would explode.
6584680	6585480	How is it attached?
6585480	6586440	Like a safety pin or?
6586440	6590280	No, it's like in permanent marker on the white shirt he's wearing.
6590280	6590920	Mm-hmm.
6590920	6592120	Yeah, at the very least.
6592120	6594440	His body would be liquefied the moment he hit the car.
6594760	6595240	No, no.
6595240	6597800	If you fall from very low or very high,
6599240	6601000	your body room is completely attacked.
6601000	6603160	There's a sweet spot in the middle where you explode.
6604760	6607400	No, you off a building, you explode from a plane.
6607400	6608120	You're fine.
6608120	6610280	Yeah, a lot of people don't understand that.
6610280	6614760	If you hold your breath theoretically the right time, you don't need to parachute.
6614760	6616040	It's a skydive.
6616040	6617320	You can leave the car.
6617320	6618360	The car collapses.
6618360	6620040	It's a good place.
6620040	6622360	If you're falling and right before you hit the ground, you jump.
6622360	6623560	Yeah, you just have to jump.
6624920	6631000	It's basically impossible, but theoretically, if you jump right before you hit the ground,
6632200	6635400	you actually not only don't need a parachute, you have an orgasm.
6638200	6641800	You come and you sneeze.
6644440	6647960	Yeah, and you learn three languages.
6649000	6650360	But you don't get to pick which one.
6650360	6659880	No, two of them are always Esperanto.
6664520	6667880	Your superpowers, you can speak a language, but you don't get to pick.
6669080	6670680	You just don't know what you're fucking talking about.
6670680	6672440	It'd be amazing if you're one superpowers.
6673160	6677720	If someone throws you out of an airplane, you land without harm.
6678360	6681720	You're probably trying to get yourself at situations.
6681720	6684440	You're constantly at a bar, like somebody you're intimidating.
6684440	6686360	Don't talk to my girlfriend that way.
6686360	6687560	What are you going to do about it?
6687560	6689080	Let's just tell you what, man.
6689640	6692840	Let's just go to the immediate conclusion here.
6692840	6693960	Let's get up in a plane.
6695400	6696520	You throw me out.
6697720	6699560	Not over the ocean, over land.
6703320	6704280	Oh, man.
6704280	6705640	80% water planet.
6705640	6707640	Yeah, that's not part of it.
6708200	6708700	Yeah.
6709480	6710440	Don't you guys...
6710440	6712600	Okay, new Hollywood question.
6712600	6715720	Don't you think someone in the movie, it follows?
6718280	6720280	Don't you think someone should have said,
6723080	6725720	I have a friend who works as a flight attendant.
6726680	6727720	Let's have sex with them.
6729400	6730200	See what happens.
6731720	6732920	Did someone have that friend?
6733480	6737320	Well, everyone is only two degrees separation from a flight attendant.
6737320	6738520	Here's what I'm worried about.
6738520	6741400	And those degrees are always fucking degrees.
6742120	6743880	Those people are fucking horny.
6744600	6745240	Go ahead, sorry.
6745240	6750040	Flight attendants, for the most part, work like one round trip
6750040	6751400	or like a couple in like...
6751400	6753160	Yeah, and it follows.
6753160	6756520	Right, but it's not going to get that far because it's walking.
6756520	6756920	Right.
6756920	6761480	So then the flight attendant goes home, it has like a month layoff.
6761480	6762920	A lot of these people do it part time.
6763560	6767640	So now the monster that has gotten like what,
6767640	6771560	two miles like in the time of that like plane round trip.
6772120	6774680	What I hear you saying is don't take off from Denver.
6774680	6781240	Like JFK, like fuck somebody, let it follow you to the airport.
6781240	6781800	Right.
6781800	6783160	Get on the plane.
6784120	6786360	First of all, it's like it follows you through security.
6787800	6789000	I'd love to see that.
6789000	6789500	Yes.
6790460	6794060	And then like, peace, see ya.
6794060	6796060	And it's like it following and you're like,
6797260	6799100	and it like goes out on the tarmac and it's like...
6801260	6803260	And then it just walks into the fucking ocean.
6803260	6806780	You're going to Tokyo from JFK.
6806780	6807260	Right.
6807260	6809980	You don't need to be a flight attendant to get on a plane though.
6809980	6811500	Well, I would say...
6811500	6811980	Yeah.
6811980	6813260	Well, because I would say this to...
6813260	6815900	But they are most likely to get on a plane.
6815900	6816940	You have to admit.
6817660	6819820	I'm already, because when I saw the movie, I was like,
6819820	6820460	get on a plane.
6820460	6822300	And the people are like, yeah, must be nice.
6823580	6824220	Okay.
6824220	6824700	All right.
6825580	6827260	They use clamshell phones.
6827260	6829900	I obviously are like, hello.
6829900	6831020	Yeah, we all just get on planes.
6831020	6831980	Hello, privilege.
6831980	6834380	And I'm like, okay, well, fuck a flight attendant,
6834380	6837180	which literally is something anyone can do.
6841420	6845500	These people are worse than Renaissance fair employees.
6847180	6852300	They are our world's disease conduit.
6852300	6852940	Oh, God.
6853740	6854780	It's out of the front.
6854780	6856380	It's 956.
6856380	6856940	Google it.
6856940	6857820	We're so close.
6857820	6858460	Google it.
6859740	6865900	Google the phrase patient zero and see how quickly any airline comes up.
6866860	6867900	All right, too much.
6867900	6868380	Well, no.
6868380	6870140	Well, look, I'll tell you.
6870140	6871180	You see, there's another...
6872220	6874300	Like all these measles cases popping up everywhere.
6874300	6875580	And every time one happens,
6875580	6878940	they show that person's like whole itinerary for a couple of days.
6879740	6884540	And the one from the other day they put up was LAX terminal two,
6884540	6887020	the employee shuttle to a hotel,
6887660	6889820	and then the Barnes and Noble at the Grove,
6889820	6891340	the J.Crew at the Grove.
6891340	6892300	Oh, embarrassing.
6895260	6897580	Oh, I'd hate for my itinerary to be out there.
6897580	6898940	A Coldplay concert.
6901820	6903660	The news anchors are like, okay.
6904060	6907020	I guess they spend a lot of time in the air.
6908460	6910540	Hey, can you just put that I went to a movie theater?
6910540	6912220	You don't have to say like what I saw.
6913100	6915180	Yeah, there was that whole Avengers endgame,
6915180	6916380	which I think it feel like,
6916380	6919340	oh, the Avengers endgame audience may have been exposed to...
6919340	6919660	Right.
6919660	6921340	No, they passed on that.
6921340	6922540	Went to J.Crew.
6922540	6924620	But what I'm saying is based on this itinerary,
6924620	6926860	and then they went back to the airport on the employee shuttle.
6926860	6929180	So it was probably a flight attendant.
6929180	6930620	I'm saying they fuck a lot.
6931340	6934060	That's how you get measles, man.
6935580	6936780	People don't want to tell you.
6937980	6939820	I get pretty drunk in the last half hour of the show.
6941260	6943020	I say stuff that I later regret.
6943020	6944860	If you're a flight attendant and you're human,
6944860	6946220	I'm already sorry.
6946220	6946940	I do want to say...
6952860	6954540	If you're a flight attendant and you're not human.
6955180	6957100	Come on, come do the show.
6957100	6957600	Yeah.
6958940	6959440	Yeah.
6961020	6962540	The It Follows Monster I do think
6962540	6964380	can walk across the bottom of the ocean.
6964380	6964860	Oh, yeah.
6964860	6965420	For sure.
6965420	6966540	That's what I'm counting on.
6966540	6966940	Yeah.
6966940	6969580	That's why I'm saying to my friend who works for JetBlue,
6969580	6971820	I'm like, dude, can you fuck?
6972540	6974460	Where do you think I work at an airline?
6974460	6976860	And I'm like, can you fuck my friend?
6977980	6978380	Yeah.
6979660	6983420	It's like a timeless evocation of the 80s or slash 90s.
6983420	6985420	Like, oh, of course I'll fuck her.
6985420	6986700	All right, you guys fuck.
6986700	6989180	All right, now you're free, Cynthia.
6989180	6992060	You and I can now fuck without any incident.
6992060	6992540	Right.
6992540	6993260	Thank you, Trevor.
6994060	6997340	Hey, you know, fly the friendly skies.
6998780	7000860	So you understand there's going to be an apparition
7000860	7001900	that's walking after you.
7001900	7004220	Hey, man, it's welcome to do it.
7004860	7006300	I'm going to Tokyo.
7007420	7009580	And then just watch this thing walking
7010460	7012220	along the fucking ocean floor.
7012220	7015100	Even if it is what he said where it's like you're just
7015100	7019100	going like Dallas to New York or something every week.
7019740	7022220	Isn't the thing going to walk like halfway to?
7022220	7024540	And then you get back and then it's just going to be like,
7024540	7026540	this is what Jesus Christ, the guy.
7026540	7027660	I got to turn around.
7027660	7029660	This is what I'm saying about their work schedule.
7029660	7030220	It does it.
7030220	7031580	It's not that consistent.
7031580	7032940	They mostly work part time.
7032940	7037180	They'll do a couple round trips and then be back in Dallas.
7037180	7038940	But you're saying they're there for a month.
7038940	7039740	Yeah, they can.
7039740	7040620	Yeah, sure.
7040620	7042620	But often they're there for three days.
7042620	7043500	What a working mom.
7043500	7045420	Three days, you know, two weeks.
7045420	7048620	And then I'm just saying it to follow a while.
7049260	7052060	If it had walked like halfway through Ohio,
7052060	7054780	and then it's like this motherfuckers back in Texas.
7054780	7055100	Yeah.
7055100	7057020	Turn around like Jesus Christ.
7057020	7058620	The guys I'll walk back.
7058620	7059020	Yeah.
7059020	7063020	And then just as they're getting back into fucking
7064540	7065420	Jeff Davis County.
7067020	7067660	Yeah, I don't know.
7067660	7070860	I'm like, what are you a stockholder and it follows ink?
7071500	7077100	Well, I like the Tokyo version of you have sex with someone.
7077100	7079100	They fly to Tokyo, which is where they live.
7079900	7082460	Or they're just going to spend enough time there
7082460	7086860	that it follows will follow into the ocean floor.
7088540	7091340	I got a better idea for how to solve that movie.
7091340	7092620	Just don't have sex.
7093500	7095980	We've all got to be having sex all the time.
7096780	7097500	Read a book.
7098860	7099660	Maybe not a weekend.
7099660	7101180	There's a whole world out there going to hike.
7101900	7105900	But like when you're at it, if it walks two days
7105900	7107020	into the Atlantic Ocean.
7107020	7107500	Right.
7108300	7110140	But then that person comes back.
7110140	7112300	Well, then it's a two day trip back.
7112300	7115100	So all you've bought yourself is a nice long weekend.
7115100	7117740	Well, that's a lot of time that you can plan your next trip.
7117740	7120620	So you go, you go to the opposite coast.
7121900	7125260	Again, like a little, a little, a little transcontinental.
7125260	7125660	Okay.
7125660	7127900	Now the money is starting to pile up here.
7128140	7130060	I can see the criticism here.
7130060	7131740	We're flying every four days.
7131740	7133900	It follows meets catch me if you can.
7135260	7136700	Oh, wow.
7136700	7139900	In a future world where it's following everyone.
7139900	7143340	And then in a fucking clever like Leo DiCaprio character
7143340	7145820	is like, I'm the only guy that gets it.
7145820	7146220	Everyone.
7146220	7146700	Fuck me.
7148300	7149020	I don't have it.
7149660	7150780	That's the question.
7150780	7155740	Could Frank Abagnale have conned the follows monster?
7158380	7160140	All right.
7160140	7161820	Well, we do our job, right?
7161820	7164380	You guys have a sports podcast, right?
7164380	7164780	Yeah.
7164780	7165900	Oh, thank you so much.
7165900	7166860	Yeah, of course.
7166860	7168940	If you want to listen to these guys,
7168940	7170460	it's called the Hollywood handbook.
7172700	7172940	Yeah.
7176540	7178300	We have a Patreon podcast now.
7178300	7180060	Yeah, the basketball one.
7180060	7181100	They get more money.
7181100	7182380	It's called the flagrant ones.
7183180	7186220	Yeah, it's a completely different thing.
7186220	7187340	Yeah, different thing.
7187900	7190460	I don't know anything about sports, but I listen to it.
7190460	7193100	And I find it enjoyable from a standpoint of someone
7193100	7195020	who doesn't know or care about sports.
7195020	7195260	Wow.
7195260	7195820	Wow.
7195820	7196780	Nice.
7196780	7198300	What is the flagrant ones about?
7198300	7199660	It's about the NBA.
7199660	7199900	Yeah.
7200940	7203100	Are you following the playoffs right now?
7203100	7204060	Are you guys big fans?
7204060	7205340	Wait, the playoffs are right now.
7207180	7207660	Just now.
7208300	7208780	Just now.
7208780	7209260	Oh, boy.
7209260	7210140	We're going to be in trouble.
7210140	7211100	Yeah, we're big fans.
7212540	7213660	Who are you rooting for?
7213660	7214540	Who do you like?
7215100	7216380	We're both from New England.
7216380	7217580	And so we like the Celtics.
7217660	7220380	Who are definitely losing now.
7220380	7222780	And then we are Clippers season ticket holders.
7222780	7223820	And we go to a lot of the games.
7223820	7224540	Sorry, I'm making fried sounds.
7224540	7226700	I'm from LA, so fuck the Celtics.
7226700	7227100	Jeff.
7227100	7228780	Well, we like the Clippers, too.
7228780	7231260	And they lost already.
7231260	7233820	So all the teams I like will be out.
7233820	7236620	And I guess then I will root for the Warriors to lose.
7237260	7237900	Yeah.
7237900	7238380	Right.
7238380	7238860	Jeff here.
7241500	7243260	Thank you for stifling your applause
7243260	7244300	because I had something coming.
7245820	7247340	That was just getting rolling.
7247660	7253660	I thought sometimes Jesus is going to dry the bowling lane.
7257900	7259180	What the fuck is that?
7259180	7259900	I don't know, dude.
7259900	7260380	I don't know.
7260380	7260860	I don't know.
7260860	7261340	I don't know.
7261340	7263820	The ball doesn't go down if it's not wet.
7265820	7268140	I'm going to start a new podcast with Sean and Hayes
7268140	7269260	about what the fuck you just said.
7270300	7272460	We're just going to spend the next three years parsing
7272460	7273340	what you just said.
7273900	7275660	Why does Jesus have to dry a bowling lane?
7275660	7279100	Just because sports are about competition between all
7279100	7283340	of the city's teams doesn't mean that sports
7283340	7285740	can't be about all of them being together.
7286620	7286940	Right.
7286940	7287740	Give me a beat.
