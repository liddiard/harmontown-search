0	14000	From the Nerdist Theater at Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California, Harmon Town is in
14000	15000	session.
15000	26000	Please welcome the mayor of Harmon Town, Jen Harmon.
26000	52000	Alright, we've got a lot to do, quit fucking around.
53000	58000	Alright, I'm out of breath, just give me a second.
58000	63000	This is the definition of what is aerobic exercise, because it's so close to what is
63000	69000	walking as you get older and older.
69000	75000	I want to start very quickly with a segment that's a favorite for everyone.
75000	79000	It's called Things that Dan Harmon is not allowed to complain about because it makes
79000	86000	him sound like an asshole.
86000	92000	These are the things that when I complain about him, reveal that I'm a narcissistic
92000	98000	rich prick with a lower value system than people in Lebanon.
98000	100000	I am a stupid fucking asshole.
100000	108000	Alright, so you're not allowed to judge me because I said that.
108000	114000	Okay, so I valet park my car constantly, even if I don't have to.
114000	118000	I'll find, I'll just find someone to valet my car.
118000	122000	There will be a parking space, I'm like, that's not good enough.
122000	127000	That's not true, I'm actually kind of annoyed with the fact that in LA there will be a
127000	131000	parking lot and it's empty, and then there's a guy in front that's like, I'm valeting
131000	132000	your car.
132000	133000	It makes me mad.
133000	142000	But, oh shit, see, now I got a new note taking app, it's called Cat Catch.
142000	145000	Everybody just fucking cool it.
145000	146000	We're going to get through this.
146000	148000	We got a lot of shit to do tonight.
148000	151000	Okay, item number one, things that I'm not allowed to complain about because they'll
151000	153000	make me sound like an asshole.
153000	156000	I pull up to the valet.
156000	163000	Well, one point A is your new application on your phone, that's your new note app.
163000	165000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's not Evernote anymore.
165000	167000	Fuck you Evernote.
167000	174000	Alright, so I pull up to the guy at the valet station, and this is happening now with increasing
174000	179000	frequency, as I have more and more to do and more and more sort of liquid assets, I would
179000	181000	say, I would call it.
181000	184000	I'll get out at the valet station, the guy will go, are you eating here?
184000	190000	He'll give me a half of his little terry card, and I'll go, yes, and then he'll start to
190000	193000	get in the car, and then I'll go, sir, sir, sir.
193000	195000	I have to come back now.
195000	199000	Already the purpose of the valet is starting to be defeated.
199000	201000	Time is running out.
201000	206000	I got Zooey Deschanel's to have lunch with.
206000	208000	That's not true.
208000	211000	But then the guy says, sir, sir, sir, sir.
211000	214000	There's a dollar on the floor of the car.
214000	216000	I don't care.
216000	218000	It costs seven dollars to park here.
218000	221000	I got to tip you three, asshole.
221000	223000	Take the dollar.
223000	226000	Alright, moving on.
226000	228000	I just don't care.
228000	231000	Yes, of course there's a dollar on the floor of my car.
231000	233000	It's called garbage.
233000	235000	The economy's in the toilet.
235000	238000	Just put your gum in it, valet man.
238000	240000	It's a dollar.
240000	243000	We're all dying.
243000	244000	A dollar.
244000	245000	I got to come back.
245000	246000	What am I supposed to do?
246000	251000	Because he gives me the choice between coming back and grubbing for my dollar or going like
251000	253000	Tom Cruise and some weird man.
253000	256000	It's yours.
256000	257000	Calling over my shoulder.
257000	260000	Deep it, man.
260000	263000	Okay, let's say it's a 20.
263000	264000	A 20?
264000	265000	I think that's cool.
265000	267000	Yeah, it's 20 times a dollar.
267000	268000	Don't argue with me.
268000	269000	We don't have any time.
269000	270000	Yeah.
270000	271000	Alright.
271000	273000	Next item.
273000	275000	Things I can't, I'm not allowed to complain about.
275000	277000	This one's, it takes too long to poop.
277000	279000	We could just move on.
279000	281000	It just takes too long to poop.
281000	285000	And I don't mean because I'm 40, but just because as you, well, it is because I'm 40
285000	287000	because as you get to 40, time becomes more valuable.
287000	289000	Like, so see the valet guy.
289000	290000	Same thing.
290000	292000	I'm becoming conscious of my mortality.
292000	293000	I have to take a shit.
293000	294000	I get it, God.
294000	296000	I got to poop to put in the toilet.
296000	297000	I just want to get it done.
297000	301000	And it's just like I'm sort of sitting there and I'm like, come on, poop.
301000	304000	Are your poops longer than when you were younger?
304000	305000	Are they getting older?
305000	306000	No, no, no.
306000	309000	I've always been, this is one thing I've always been really good at.
309000	315000	Well, no, see, I can debate that right there because you gave yourself a hemorrhoid by
315000	317000	sitting on the toilet too long.
317000	321000	No, because I love to like, yeah, I sit on the phone and I, but okay, that's the point
321000	325000	is that the doctor told me like, don't, don't tweet on the toilet.
325000	326000	I didn't know this was a thing.
326000	328000	And so I was like, okay, I'll stop doing that.
328000	329000	I used to enjoy my time on the toilet.
329000	331000	This is, thank you, Jeff.
331000	333000	This is exactly why I'm not starting to notice.
333000	337000	It takes too long to poop because now I'm not allowed to do other stuff on the toilet.
337000	339000	Thank you.
339000	343000	If I can't do anything but poop, then poop faster.
343000	350000	But, okay, superhero movies need earlier thresholds, need earlier thresholds.
351000	359000	Minute 20 into your movie called Captain America, a comic book no one likes anyway.
359000	364000	I don't, I want to see his fucking round shield flying around.
364000	368000	You can't say on page 70, oh, look at that shield.
368000	369000	Maybe that should be red, white, and blue.
369000	371000	Fuck you, Captain America movie.
371000	373000	Fuck you, Superman movie.
373000	376000	Fuck you, Hulk movie, whichever third version it was.
376000	379000	Like, fuck you, superhero movie, Green Lantern.
379000	380000	Fuck you.
380000	383000	Like, stop, speed it up.
383000	384000	You're a superhero movie.
384000	390000	I bought a ticket because I already accept that a guy can get a whooba from the planet Buba.
390000	394000	And as a result, he's allowed to phuba.
394000	395000	No, I fucking can't.
395000	396000	What are you trying?
396000	399000	What are you making on, Golden Pond, you fucking assholes?
399000	401000	Knock it off.
401000	402000	Knock it off.
402000	404000	In and out, 90 minutes.
404000	405000	Page 20.
405000	409000	I'm phubbing.
409000	410000	I don't fucking care.
410000	411000	Name a thing.
411000	412000	Name a noun.
412000	413000	Somebody say it.
413000	415000	Tuba man.
415000	416000	Okay.
416000	419000	Page 20 is playing the tuba, okay?
419000	421000	And using it to fight crime.
421000	426000	I don't mean like he's got a trumpet and he's like, this should be bigger.
426000	429000	Fucking page 20 of your screenplay.
429000	436000	Tuba in his mouth blasting like radioactive rainbow waves out at a burglar going like,
436000	440000	oh shit, I'm robbing a bank, but now I can't because a tuba man.
440000	445000	Because the movie's called tuba man is why.
445000	446000	That's the thing.
446000	448000	You can't charge me a ticket.
448000	453000	I have a right to ask for my money back if half the movie is a guy thinking maybe he
453000	458000	should maybe kind of fight something with crime involved or something involving a tuba.
458000	459000	Fuck you.
459000	463000	I said, Captain America is walking around forever in that movie.
463000	466000	It's like, oh, I'm just dressed as a silly guy.
466000	468000	I just wish I could fight some Nazis.
468000	470000	Fucking cock.
470000	474000	It'd be one thing if you were Spider-Man and you pulled that shit.
474000	475000	You're Captain America.
475000	478000	You're a dick.
478000	479000	All right.
479000	480000	Iron Man.
480000	482000	I think you're allowed to complain about that.
482000	484000	You are allowed to complain about that.
484000	487000	Well, I'm 40, so it makes me sound like a knob.
487000	491000	I should be putting more thought into Cambodia and things like that.
491000	493000	What's going on in Cambodia?
493000	496000	Well, when I was 10, some stuff.
496000	497000	That's my point.
497000	499000	That's my point.
499000	502000	I don't know what the new Cambodia is.
502000	504000	I should.
504000	508000	While I'm on the subject, Iron Man should be an alcoholic in the movies.
508000	513000	In the comic book, he's an alcoholic and it's fucking amazing.
513000	514000	That's the important thing about him.
514000	516000	Batman's parents got killed.
516000	517000	That's fine.
517000	518000	That's great.
518000	519000	I love Batman.
519000	521000	Spider-Man's like a young, naive kid who's like...
521000	523000	He got through this responsibility, thrust upon him.
523000	524000	He's a wisecracker.
524000	528000	The whole point of Iron Man, he's the Howard Hughes of superheroes,
528000	529000	and he's got a drinking problem.
529000	530000	That's it, you know?
530000	531000	But he's good at his shit.
531000	533000	He's a functional alcoholic.
533000	537000	That's his kryptonite, is that he's so good at drinking.
537000	540000	People are like, holy shit, we can't fire him.
540000	543000	He drinks too much.
543000	545000	It gets work done while he's doing it.
545000	546000	So it's you.
546000	549000	Well, I like all of these...
549000	552000	All of us like all of these superheroes for various reasons.
552000	555000	You, as a 40-year-old, you're a superhero fantasy
555000	559000	is that you can be a functional alcoholic and still fight crime.
559000	563000	That ain't no fantasy, Jack.
563000	566000	What crimes are you fighting?
566000	571000	The crime of people not respecting me.
571000	574000	I often lose.
574000	575000	All right.
575000	576000	That brings me to my next point.
576000	579000	Jeff, thank you for your unintentional segue.
579000	581000	It's just all instinctual for me, Dan.
581000	582000	All right.
582000	585000	My next complaint on the list of things I'm not allowed to complain about
585000	587000	because they make me seem like I'm an asshole.
587000	590000	I'm too famous.
590000	591000	Let's just move on.
591000	592000	Let's just move on.
592000	593000	Next item.
593000	595000	I apologize too much.
595000	596000	I don't know.
596000	597000	I'm sick of it.
597000	598000	I'm tired of...
598000	600000	I'm 40 years old.
600000	603000	I just want to just cut my head open
603000	606000	and pour the contents of my brain out.
606000	610000	The idea of an apology is that you clarify to somebody
610000	612000	that you didn't mean to hurt their feelings.
612000	617000	I am the only one who you can actually go and find out whether or not...
617000	619000	like what I really meant.
619000	621000	It's not fair.
621000	622000	I'm sick of it.
622000	623000	I'm not a fucking politician.
623000	625000	I didn't run for office.
625000	628000	I'm not accountable to electors.
628000	630000	I stand in front of a microphone.
630000	632000	I puke my brains out.
632000	634000	I have diarrhea of the mouth.
634000	637000	I say for two hours a week how I feel.
637000	639000	I'm honest about my emotions.
639000	641000	The people that don't like me, I don't like you.
641000	642000	I hate you.
642000	643000	You're pieces of shit.
643000	647000	You're dishonest fucking agents of caution and restraint.
647000	649000	You want people to talk less.
649000	651000	You want people to be more like ants.
651000	652000	I fucking hate you.
652000	655000	And I will apologize to you
655000	660000	in a cautious fucking détente, like a ceasefire.
660000	663000	You're bad people and I don't care if you don't like me anymore.
663000	664000	You're pieces of shit.
664000	665000	Fuck off.
665000	666000	All right.
666000	668000	Next item on my list.
670000	672000	Again, you can't argue with this stuff
672000	674000	because I'm admitting to you this makes me a bad person
674000	676000	for having these complaints.
676000	677000	Next item.
677000	679000	Everyone in the world is stupid.
679000	681000	Everybody.
681000	682000	Maybe including me.
682000	683000	Time will tell.
683000	684000	I don't care.
684000	685000	Moving on.
685000	688000	There's no good bar near Meltdown.
688000	689000	There's nothing.
689000	690000	There's no place to drink.
690000	692000	Pikey can take a fuck.
692000	693000	I didn't go today.
693000	695000	I willfully chose not to go.
695000	696000	I can't take it anymore.
696000	697000	I can't go sit over there.
697000	698000	What's it?
698000	700000	Maria Conchita Alonzo?
700000	701000	What's it called?
701000	702000	El Compadre?
702000	703000	Yes.
703000	705000	You can't drink there.
705000	708000	It turns into a sports bar after 3 p.m.
708000	711000	I don't know what accounting firm is above it,
711000	715000	but it just gets flooded with J. Moore clones,
715000	720000	and everyone's snapping and tapping quarters on the bar,
720000	724000	and they want their appletinis and their margafooters,
724000	727000	and I can't sit down and have a drink.
727000	728000	What do we think bars are for?
728000	729000	What are we doing?
729000	731000	You come into a bar with a group of people
731000	732000	that you want to talk to from work,
732000	734000	go get a fucking table.
734000	736000	There's some of us in this world that are really, really,
736000	737000	we have a disease.
737000	739000	I just want to go up to a trough,
739000	741000	and I want to make eye contact.
741000	743000	I want to plop my ass down on a stool,
743000	746000	and I need my fucking spinach slash kryptonite.
746000	749000	I need it pumped into my body at a certain rate,
749000	754000	or I can't give these people what they want.
754000	755000	So that's it.
755000	756000	That's it.
756000	757000	Okay.
757000	758000	All right, we got through that.
758000	766000	All right, our next segment.
766000	768000	I promised we'd bring it back.
768000	769000	Is Connor here?
769000	770000	Yeah.
770000	771000	Okay, questions with Connor.
771000	772000	Do you have another question, Connor?
772000	773000	Oh, yeah.
773000	774000	Okay, questions with Connor.
774000	775000	Welcome back, Connor.
775000	776000	Thank you, Jeff.
776000	778000	Last week, Connor brought us the tantalizing question
778000	781000	of whether it's better to teleport or to have sex.
781000	783000	I don't know that we totally got to the bottom of that.
783000	784000	I know.
784000	785000	Who knows?
785000	786000	I mean, that's the point of the question.
786000	795000	The question was the journey.
796000	797000	Connor's conundrums.
797000	798000	Yeah.
798000	799000	Did you make a decision?
799000	800000	I don't know.
800000	803000	It sounded like Aaron would be cool with me not coming.
803000	804000	Okay.
804000	805000	And like to travel.
805000	810000	I think I would go teleportation ultimately.
810000	812000	Oh, no, there was a twist at the very end,
812000	815000	where you started talking about how you would have the drive
815000	818000	to orgasm, but not the ability.
818000	819000	That's a deal breaker.
819000	820000	We could play with that.
820000	821000	You could choose.
821000	822000	Well, can I play with it?
822000	825000	Or if I say there's no drive, no drive.
825000	826000	Okay.
826000	827000	No drive.
827000	828000	Then teleportation.
828000	830000	That's well, that's if you don't want to walk around.
830000	832000	You don't have the desire to the one that there's no point.
832000	836000	If you have a human desire to enjoy sex.
836000	838000	Well, so you get the finish line, buddy.
838000	841000	I'm just saying that's also, you know, you change your answer.
841000	842000	Yeah.
842000	845000	I thought that the curse was that you'd want to, but you couldn't.
845000	848000	You're too busy going to Paris glasses.
848000	849000	Yeah.
849000	852000	But so if you don't have a biological imperative to,
852000	857000	but you remember it fondly or.
857000	859000	So you stand up and face everybody right now.
859000	864000	Just so you can see what I'm looking at when you're doing this.
864000	865000	Describe him, Jeff.
865000	868000	A sub segment called Jeff's descriptions.
868000	871000	There's a six foot, what do you four, six, four, six, five
871000	873000	gentlemen with a mohawk and a proper mohawk.
873000	875000	It's short on this where it needs to be.
875000	876000	A long word ought to be.
876000	878000	He's not that mad at the queen.
879000	881000	He still minds the bollocks.
881000	883000	Yeah.
883000	885000	He lives in parliament.
885000	888000	He's also wearing one of the my podium here.
888000	892000	I have a pair of louvered eighties hot pink sunglasses here.
892000	894000	You brought these.
894000	896000	That doesn't surprise me one bit.
896000	897000	It's Tyler, right?
897000	899000	So Tyler, I see a lot of people out here wearing,
899000	902000	wearing eighties novelty sunglasses.
902000	903000	And okay.
903000	905000	So now you've been described.
905000	906000	Yes.
906000	907000	All right.
907000	908000	Sub section.
908000	909000	Jeff describes people.
909000	910000	All right.
910000	911000	What was your point?
911000	912000	I'm sorry.
912000	914000	One is like, so, uh, uh, so you can go sex or teleportation.
914000	916000	You say you wouldn't have the drive for it.
916000	918000	So you wouldn't have a biological drive for it,
918000	921000	but you still remember fondly the times that you did have sex in the past.
921000	922000	I guess.
922000	923000	A nostalgic thing, but not a biological.
923000	924000	Yeah.
924000	926000	But that's not when I, when I want to have sex,
926000	928000	it's not because I remember it being awesome.
928000	932000	That's that's the, that's absolutely.
932000	935000	If you could just take away the, if you could turn it off.
936000	939000	Teleportation unfair advantage because if you can still have sex,
939000	943000	you still might want to teleport someday.
943000	946000	This gentleman said that gives teleportation unfair advantage because if
946000	949000	you could still have sex, you still have to have the urge to teleport.
949000	951000	Yeah.
951000	952000	Okay.
952000	954000	But we've tabled this one because now we have a new Connor.
954000	955000	Yes.
955000	956000	All right.
957000	959000	Connor conundrum coming through.
959000	960000	All right.
960000	961000	Connor conundrum.
961000	962000	What about you?
962000	965000	Ask yourself this question and you will find,
968000	971000	I teleport to a time when that song made sense.
971000	973000	A bad, bad, bad theme song.
973000	974000	Bad evening.
974000	975000	Teleport to a time.
975000	976000	Yes.
976000	977000	We were, we went over this.
977000	978000	You can't teleport to a time.
978000	979000	God damn it.
979000	980000	That's right.
980000	981000	I keep thinking time travel.
981000	982000	All right.
982000	983000	I'm sorry.
983000	984000	Connor.
984000	985000	What is your new conundrum for us this week?
985000	986000	Okay.
986000	987000	Really quick.
987000	988000	Did we cheer alcoholism a few minutes ago?
988000	989000	Yeah.
989000	994000	When a comic book character that has, can make a jet suit has it.
994000	995000	That's amazing.
995000	997000	I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page.
997000	998000	Yeah.
998000	999000	Okay.
999000	1000000	All right.
1000000	1001000	This is a, this is my question this week.
1001000	1007000	If you had to choose between gaining flight, but losing your sight so you become blind
1007000	1014000	or every time you fart, you accidentally time travel, which would you choose?
1014000	1018000	Wait, I have 14 questions.
1020000	1022000	You can fly, but you can't see.
1022000	1023000	Yes.
1023000	1026000	So you're a blind pigeon.
1026000	1027000	Or a bat.
1027000	1028000	Or a bat.
1028000	1029000	Without the.
1029000	1030000	Are you a bat?
1030000	1031000	Can you, do you have sonar?
1031000	1032000	Okay.
1032000	1033000	I'm sorry, Connor.
1033000	1034000	Just to clarify.
1034000	1035000	Yes.
1035000	1036000	Are you blind only while you're flying?
1036000	1038000	No, you're blind all the time.
1038000	1039000	Oh.
1039000	1040000	Oh, fuck yourself.
1040000	1041000	I'm going to fart.
1041000	1042000	I'm going to fart.
1042000	1044000	I'm going to fart action all the time travel.
1044000	1045000	Yeah.
1045000	1048000	I'm immediately, I'm all over the farting time travel.
1048000	1049000	Okay.
1049000	1052000	Because I could, there's ways you could hold your fart, like, like, and explain to people,
1052000	1054000	like a new relationship.
1054000	1056000	Sweetie, there's something you have to know about me.
1056000	1058000	You may never see me again.
1058000	1062000	You're talking about your maiden and like medieval times because this has already happened before.
1062000	1063000	All right.
1063000	1064000	What's the range of time travel?
1064000	1066000	You could end up in a lava pit.
1066000	1072000	Well, I guess you could, you'd travel from the spot you're in or not.
1072000	1076000	I mean, maybe this is a curse since everyone farts sooner or later.
1076000	1081000	And since time travel is just going to take you to some random place and thereby completely destabilize your life.
1081000	1086000	And since, well, no, no, fuck you because like, I'm starting to get so angry at you.
1086000	1088000	But you're saying I have to be blind.
1088000	1092000	Well, I think what this one is, this is not what cool thing would I pick.
1092000	1095000	These are, I'm choosing between two curses here.
1095000	1099000	Both which are, they can have incentives, but it's not as...
1099000	1104000	Yeah, because the whole point of flight is that you would see the vistas for me that you could, you know, you could fly around.
1104000	1105000	Well, that's where you're going.
1105000	1109000	I'm not going to leave the ground if I can't see.
1109000	1114000	Are you a bat? Do you have that kind of sound location kind of thing?
1114000	1118000	I don't think so, but when you lose a sense, don't people like, aren't their other senses heightened?
1118000	1121000	Yeah, but over millennia of evolution.
1121000	1125000	Like, if you give me the blind flight, I'd fly into a thing.
1125000	1128000	Okay. What if you were only blind when you flew?
1128000	1131000	Connor, you had a week to figure this out.
1132000	1134000	No time to workshop.
1135000	1138000	Okay. If you're only blind when you fly, then I'll take the blindness.
1138000	1144000	Because the uncontrollability of the, at the root of it all, is my control issues.
1144000	1152000	Like, if I'm just farting and I'm randomly time traveling, so I can neither control farting nor where I go when I fart.
1152000	1154000	And when I come back and stuff.
1154000	1161000	Like, if you told me, okay, for instance, if you take the blindness, if you make it when you fly, you're blind.
1161000	1163000	But when you're not flying, you're not blind.
1163000	1172000	And also, when you fart, you time travel to somewhere random, but the next time you fart, you come back.
1172000	1174000	Okay. That's a good twist.
1174000	1180000	Then I'll take farting, because nobody double farts like vitamin A children.
1181000	1183000	What if you triple fart?
1183000	1184000	Then you go...
1184000	1185000	Somewhere new.
1185000	1187000	Then you're Jack the Ripper. I don't know.
1188000	1191000	If you farted an odd number of farts, you could be the Pleistocene.
1191000	1193000	But then you fart, but then you eat some...
1193000	1196000	You find some beans in the Pleistocene, and you, you know...
1196000	1199000	The Pleistocene era had no beans, Dan.
1199000	1201000	There's other things that make you fart, Jeff.
1201000	1202000	How do you know?
1202000	1204000	I talk to a dinosaur.
1205000	1208000	Blind fly!
1208000	1212000	Smash. How do you land when you're blind flying? How do you know when you want to fucking settle down?
1212000	1215000	I mean, do you just hover down really cautiously?
1215000	1218000	Is there questions that you should have asked yourself?
1218000	1224000	It's a good choice, though, because that is like, okay, so you're in an alleyway, and muggers are coming down.
1224000	1226000	This always happens.
1226000	1230000	And they're like, we're gonna cut you wide open, sucker.
1230000	1232000	They're white.
1233000	1237000	It's just an urban environment. Everyone talks like this.
1237000	1244000	We're gonna cut you from groin to loin, which isn't that far, but it might hit your femoral artery.
1244000	1248000	You can bleed out, sucker! We want your wallet, sucker!
1248000	1255000	And then, so you're like at this dead end alley, and you're like, so then with your vision still intact, you look around.
1255000	1258000	You look up, and you go like, okay.
1258000	1265000	That's a fact, and then you go like, okay, uh, uh, blind flight, give me a flight beyond sight!
1265000	1270000	And you just, at least you're not getting your wallet taken, sucker.
1270000	1275000	And then you move like eight feet to the left, and you're like, you come down super slow.
1275000	1280000	How do you lead up to page 20 of blind flights? How do you get us to that?
1280000	1282000	That's what happens on page 20.
1282000	1286000	Wait, wait, wait. What leads him up to that? What gives him that?
1286000	1290000	The doctor is a blind guy, and he goes like, I think we could give you your sight back.
1290000	1293000	But you'd have to fly.
1293000	1296000	But without sight.
1296000	1303000	And the blind guy's like, okay. I don't know. Don't ask me to write movies for free for you people.
1303000	1306000	You always do that. You love them.
1306000	1308000	We got Mohawk guys raising his hand again.
1308000	1312000	What about the opposite? If you could see why you're flying, but you were blind all the rest of the time.
1312000	1314000	Ooh!
1314000	1321000	He's saying, what if you're just an operational blind man or woman walking down the road, but if you wanted to, you could fly and see.
1321000	1323000	I think we'd all take that, right?
1323000	1333000	But then to counterbalance that, you'd have to be time traveling only when you were not farting.
1333000	1336000	I want to go to Mexico, but...
1336000	1339000	You're like Billy Pilgrim in Catch-22.
1339000	1348000	Slenderhouse 5. You have no control over when you're coming and going, unless you're farting, and then you can love a woman.
1348000	1355000	That's enough. We've got a lot to do tonight. Ask yourself that conundrum at home. Send us your picture pages about it.
1355000	1360000	And we'll talk to other guests tonight about whether or not they would fart or blind fly.
1360000	1362000	Connor, will you come back next week with one more?
1362000	1363000	Absolutely.
1363000	1365000	Connor's Conundrums, everybody!
1365000	1380000	It brings to mind the conundrum. Would you like to have Connor's Conundrums every week, or eat a bag of jelly beans?
1380000	1389000	I would say, and I support what he's doing here, I like the idea that this time was a choice between two not-so-attractive ideas.
1389000	1390000	They both had a price.
1390000	1394000	A real conundrum is which is the lesser of two crappy superpowers.
1394000	1398000	Let me ask you a very basic thing. Would you rather be blind or deaf?
1398000	1400000	Deaf.
1400000	1403000	Because of the internet.
1403000	1404000	For real.
1404000	1410000	No, because in case I learn how to fly.
1410000	1415000	I'd rather see it than hear it. I get more irritated by things I hear than things I see.
1415000	1421000	I'm constantly wishing I could just choose what I could hear over...
1421000	1425000	I never wish I could see something different. You can always avert your eyes.
1425000	1429000	It's a really tough choice for me. Even though we're 90% visually oriented,
1429000	1435000	but it's that connection that we have between people. It's really packed into the hearing.
1435000	1438000	But the internet changes that. You can connect to people with...
1438000	1440000	And you're a writer. You can still tell stories.
1440000	1445000	You can sit. I can just not hear shit, get a good night's sleep, and just type on the...
1445000	1447000	Just go on Reddit and connect with people.
1447000	1451000	If I'm in a bar or restaurant, sometimes it's not the noise. It's the bar tappers.
1451000	1457000	The guys that drum on bars. You can't just hear it. It also has a physical vibration to it.
1457000	1461000	Now I'm nervous like you, you fucking piece of shit. Stop drumming.
1461000	1469000	It's a very isolating condition. Deafness, though. In ways that we can't understand.
1469000	1476000	I remember reading that thing that more deaf people commit suicide than blind people.
1476000	1480000	Because they're cut off from that...
1480000	1483000	You don't...
1483000	1494000	Deaf communities, they have communities where they're against cochlear implants and stuff.
1494000	1497000	Because we're effectively a different...
1497000	1500000	I don't know if they'd say species, but they're going,
1501000	1508000	We're so different from other people that we actually need to stay together because other people don't treat us right.
1508000	1511000	No one understands what it's like to be us.
1511000	1521000	They stick together and they actually look at people who go in and get those cochlear implants or whatever they're called.
1521000	1524000	Like, oh, you're not one of us then.
1525000	1531000	And I'm not saying if you're deaf and you're reading a transcript of this, that's not funny.
1531000	1539000	If you're deaf and you're reading a transcript of this, I apologize for the bracketed laughter that just happened.
1539000	1543000	But I'm not saying there's a million kinds of deaf people.
1543000	1547000	I think you actually... I'm not joking. You might have changed my mind. I might go back to...
1547000	1553000	It's an intense thing to be cut off from people on that fundamental level.
1553000	1559000	It's easy for us to imagine what it would be like to cut off from vision in that it would be catastrophic for us.
1559000	1562000	And yet it would be so much more fundamental.
1562000	1565000	Vision is just like, oh, God, I'd trip over my ottoman.
1565000	1571000	But hearing is like, oh, my God, I will never hear another person again. I will never...
1571000	1573000	Something to think about.
1573000	1577000	Connor, I had an easier conundrum than you.
1577000	1583000	Before I answer your question, there's something like Aaron was saying that you guys want to travel again,
1583000	1586000	but you don't like traveling to places that don't speak English.
1586000	1592000	You'd prefer to be somewhere that was English speaking because you're a verbal communicator.
1592000	1595000	So deafness would be harder on you.
1595000	1600000	I'd be more nervous about it. I mean, I would definitely be a shut-in if I was deaf.
1600000	1604000	First of all, I think if I was blind, I would be a shut-in.
1604000	1607000	Maybe that's an unhealthy phrase for it.
1607000	1616000	But I would just close myself in, because I would just be communicating purely through the internet with other people.
1616000	1620000	And I would just kind of want to build on that, I think.
1620000	1621000	What were you going to say?
1621000	1626000	Would you rather be deaf at birth or lose your hearing as a teenager and know what you're missing?
1626000	1631000	Deaf at birth or lose your hearing as a teenager is the conundrum of those.
1631000	1632000	And know what you're missing.
1632000	1635000	You see, Connor, that's how it's done.
1635000	1636000	No, come on.
1636000	1637000	I'm kidding.
1637000	1639000	Connor, we bullied him.
1639000	1641000	Connor's deaf. He can't hear us.
1641000	1645000	That was my point. I wanted to reveal it to you guys that Connor was deaf.
1645000	1650000	All right. Well, I don't know. I mean, good question, buddy. Good job.
1650000	1653000	Your medal's in the mail. We're done with the segment.
1654000	1656000	We got a lot of stuff to do.
1656000	1657000	What would you pick?
1657000	1659000	Who asked you to pick? Viking?
1662000	1663000	I guess at birth.
1663000	1664000	Yeah.
1664000	1666000	I feel like it'd be lonelier to know what you're missing.
1666000	1668000	I think that's probably true, yeah.
1668000	1669000	At birth, he said.
1669000	1671000	At birth. I think I'd go for that as well.
1671000	1672000	I assume so.
1672000	1676000	I mean, what's the, yeah, what is the value of having something and having it taken away?
1676000	1678000	What about, okay, I'm making one up here.
1678000	1682000	What if you could, you have the choice between, between being deaf at birth,
1682000	1687000	but you could fly when you turn 40.
1689000	1690000	But you're an alcoholic.
1691000	1692000	Made of iron.
1694000	1696000	Or, what's the opposite of that one?
1696000	1697000	But you are.
1697000	1700000	Everyone you talk to turns blind.
1701000	1705000	But you can tunnel to the center of the earth and not get burnt by the magma.
1706000	1707000	Until you're 40.
1707000	1711000	At which point, you have to drink magma in order to do a show.
1712000	1714000	All right. Think about it.
1716000	1718000	We have a special guest tonight.
1718000	1722000	He was actually briefly up here, like a meteor flashing before you,
1722000	1724000	like a superhero flying through the sky.
1726000	1729000	We want to bring him up again because we barely grazed the surface,
1729000	1733000	and we're not doing it because we, I don't know.
1733000	1734000	I'm not Tony Danza.
1734000	1736000	I'm not bringing up people with recipes.
1736000	1743000	I figure the podcast technology is, it's for doing stuff you can't do on TV.
1743000	1747000	And one of those things is like kind of laying humanity bare.
1747000	1749000	And one of the craziest things about humanity,
1749000	1754000	one of the biggest elephants in the room is sickness, mortality, conditions,
1754000	1758000	you know, like the stuff that we fear the most.
1758000	1763000	And there are people among us who are tethered to us with a rope
1763000	1768000	and are hanging out on the precipice of these things that we kind of like,
1768000	1773000	we fear so much that we don't even, it's just more convenient to think about them.
1773000	1776000	And you would think that would not make for good podcast material.
1776000	1780000	But I have a feeling like it's really important to talk to this guy.
1780000	1782000	You saw him last week.
1782000	1784000	Let's bring a Sikh Donnelly up here.
1794000	1795000	How are you doing?
1795000	1799000	You said, you said you had a rough night, but you were, you were cool to come in today.
1799000	1800000	Yeah. Can I stand?
1800000	1801000	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
1801000	1803000	What happens when you sit?
1803000	1806000	Honestly, I was in a wheelchair for a long time.
1806000	1808000	So when I was learning to walk again.
1808000	1811000	So I have this, when I sit for too long, I freak out.
1811000	1812000	Oh my God.
1812000	1815000	So you had to relearn how to walk after that.
1815000	1817000	Okay. So let's explain from the top.
1817000	1825000	So a Sikh you, you one day you had an aneurysm, which is an explosion in the, in the brain.
1825000	1830000	Yeah. I was, I was wiping my butt at LAX with the door open and a good one.
1830000	1831000	You could still do.
1831000	1833000	It didn't wipe out the callback part.
1836000	1839000	No, we were just walking.
1839000	1842000	I went to dinner with some friends was complaining about a migraine.
1842000	1844000	I've had migraines since I was eight years old.
1844000	1847000	So, uh, we didn't think that anything was different about it.
1847000	1851000	And then we were going out for the night and then I just dropped to the ground.
1851000	1853000	You just fell down at LAX or somewhere else?
1853000	1857000	No, no, no, no, just at your house.
1857000	1860000	Was it, was it, did you feel pain when you fell down?
1860000	1861000	I don't remember any of it.
1861000	1868000	I barely remember waking up in the hospital and then the doctor apparently talked to me and said, you know,
1868000	1870000	there's, there's some complications with what's going on to you.
1870000	1873000	We need to put you in a medically induced coma.
1873000	1878000	Uh, we don't know for how long, which means they give you drugs that just make you unconscious for a while.
1878000	1879000	I'm just gone. Yeah.
1879000	1881000	For 11 days I was out.
1881000	1884000	I was only supposed to be out for six or seven days, but then there was another complication.
1884000	1890000	I flatlined and then they saved me and then I was in for another five days.
1890000	1896000	And so during this medically induced coma, they studied your brain a little bit enough to tell you what had happened.
1896000	1897000	Well, yeah.
1897000	1901000	Well, and while I was under, they also did a couple of procedures to save my life.
1901000	1907000	So they did a process called coiling, which is, um, they actually don't go through your brain to do this.
1907000	1908000	It's going to sound weird.
1908000	1914000	They make an incision in your leg and they go straight up to your brain and they put these coils
1914000	1920000	and these coils are like little copper tubes that, you know, when an aneurysm happens, blood is pouring all over your brain.
1920000	1924000	And so everything that the blood touches, it's destroying.
1924000	1928000	And so these coils go in and they reroute the blood so that it's not.
1928000	1932000	How do they get a coil from your leg to your brain?
1932000	1935000	Like, like, like, like, how does it follow any path?
1935000	1936000	I'm not.
1936000	1937000	Okay, good.
1937000	1938000	You're not the guy to ask.
1938000	1941000	I'll bring my doctor one night.
1941000	1949000	But I mean, to interject at this point, like, uh, like this is, I'm sure I speak for most people in the audience,
1949000	1959000	like even beyond, I think getting certain types of cancer or something, this represents like, like a worst nightmare
1959000	1963000	because it's so uncontrollable.
1963000	1966000	It's just, it just, you're just suddenly told you're walking along.
1966000	1967000	Everything's going fine.
1967000	1972000	You, you black out, you wake up in a hospital and they're telling you, yeah, a thing just is happening.
1972000	1978000	And then, and then it gets worse because now you've been told that, like, you,
1978000	1982000	they don't know why, but you're having them repeatedly.
1982000	1983000	Right.
1983000	1984000	They keep happening.
1984000	1987000	Yeah, I keep having new aneurysms grow.
1987000	1991000	Um, and they can't figure out why because mostly it's a genetic thing.
1991000	1995000	Uh, for a guy my age, like I was 28 when I had mine.
1995000	2001000	And, um, and they were like, we can't even figure out why this happened to you because they're like, you know, it's a lot.
2002000	2009000	The percentage is higher in African-American men that age or in women that age or everybody but me, I guess.
2009000	2010000	And so they couldn't figure out why.
2010000	2012000	And then they looked at my family history.
2012000	2015000	No one on my father's side, no one on my mother's side.
2015000	2017000	And so they're like, we, we don't know what this is.
2017000	2021000	We don't know if this is an evolution of what, what happens to aneurysms.
2021000	2026000	We don't know what it is, but that's why they kind of poke and probe and study.
2027000	2028000	Yeah.
2028000	2042000	The only silver lining of that booth, giant, giant six foot quotes are on silver lining is that because they don't know what's going on, they're actually giving you like free treatment because you're kind of guinea pigging you, figuring out what's going on.
2042000	2044000	So you had one aneurysm but actually exploded.
2044000	2045000	Yeah, ruptured.
2045000	2053000	And then I, then they found at Christmas time, last time I think I spoke to you and I was pretty heartbroken, they found three more.
2053000	2057000	That are a weak spot in a blood vessel, right?
2057000	2058000	Exactly.
2058000	2059000	Yeah.
2059000	2060000	It's almost like a clot in a way.
2060000	2064000	It's like a, but yeah, it's weak tissue that's, that might explode.
2064000	2068000	When they, when they find them, then are they able to do something?
2068000	2069000	Yeah.
2069000	2070000	Yeah.
2070000	2071000	There's like, you can do lasers.
2071000	2072000	There's, there's another coiling type process.
2072000	2075000	There's, there's a couple of different options, but it's always good to catch them.
2075000	2077000	You know, it's, it's treatable when you catch them.
2077000	2091000	So, and I think the most tragic thing, the thing that made Aaron burst into tears, appearing about it for five seconds, last week, is this concept that your temporal lobe was flooded.
2091000	2092000	Yeah.
2092000	2097000	And that, that one thing that got wiped out was your visual memory and you're an artist.
2097000	2106000	And so like, like everything that you draw is affected by the concept of visual memory that you can't like, like, like use the example of an apple in private content.
2106000	2111000	Well, like, like when I close my eyes, I actually don't know what you look like anymore.
2111000	2114000	So I don't, when I wake up, I don't remember dreams.
2114000	2117000	I don't have, I have knowledge of stuff.
2117000	2118000	Well, close your eyes for a second.
2118000	2120000	I look like you and McGregor.
2120000	2122000	Just roughly.
2122000	2123000	I mean, I do.
2123000	2125000	I'm just, I'm just letting you know.
2125000	2126000	Don't exploit him, Dan.
2126000	2128000	I'm not capitalizing on anything.
2128000	2130000	I'm just clarifying for the audience.
2130000	2134000	I don't know what he looks like.
2134000	2143000	But, but also like if you were, you assume that he remember you and McGregor and not you.
2143000	2150000	But, but, but even worse than that, like fundamentally, you might not know what an apple looks like, right?
2150000	2151000	Oh yeah.
2151000	2153000	I mean, listen, I'm holding it or looking at it.
2153000	2154000	Right.
2154000	2155000	So you're seeing these things for a first time.
2155000	2156000	It's total.
2156000	2157000	It's 100%.
2157000	2158000	There's no visual memory at all.
2158000	2159000	No.
2159000	2160000	Yeah.
2160000	2163000	It's weird because like, I'll see somebody and I'll say hey to them and they'll go, how the hell does he remember me?
2163000	2165000	But it's, it's, I don't know.
2165000	2166000	It's, it's hard to explain.
2166000	2167000	I don't remember.
2167000	2173000	Like I ran into Anthony today and I actually, it's, and Spencer and I knew who they were, but I can't explain why.
2173000	2174000	Through mannerism, maybe.
2174000	2179000	Maybe that, or someone was saying about energies, like, because I'm new to that concept.
2179000	2181000	It's nothing about face blindness.
2181000	2185000	That people have that, that lack of, there's a thing in a part of your brain that uses visual recognition.
2185000	2186000	Yeah.
2186000	2191000	And there are people that they've known for their entire lives and they have to reintroduce themselves every day to them.
2191000	2195000	But, but if they hear a cough that you had the other day or just certain little signals.
2195000	2196000	Yeah.
2196000	2197000	Talking helps.
2197000	2199000	Like if I hear someone talk enough, I'm like, I'm in another room.
2199000	2201000	I'm like, Oh, I know that's so-and-so.
2201000	2205000	And you know, it's Dan and I because there's a post on your brain going, that's my uncle.
2205000	2207000	That person that's talking in the other room.
2207000	2208000	No.
2208000	2216000	The family thing is the hardest because most of my actual memories and knowledge of memories are, they go only back like five, six years.
2216000	2217000	Right.
2217000	2219000	So like childhood, a lot of stuff was wiped out.
2219000	2221000	And you talked about sitting down with your mom.
2221000	2223000	I'm just going all the way, by the way.
2223000	2225000	This is like, I'll make a joke.
2225000	2226000	No, no, no, no.
2226000	2227000	Don't worry about that.
2227000	2237000	I was talking to you after the show last week and I just thought like, what the fuck are we doing with this podcast technology for not like, like, and it's not, it's not of any heroism on my part of nobility.
2237000	2241000	I was just thinking like, like, like, like, what are we, what are we doing?
2241000	2246000	Like, like, like, like, this is something that's not televisable because it's not like, like, who's going to tune in?
2247000	2256000	I'd like to hear about this, but it, and yet it is mythologically like, like, like, like, like, like, this is, this is what we all are afraid of.
2256000	2266000	You were in a certain sense, like more so than somebody who's diagnosed with, oh, there's a, there's a microorganism that's eating away at your, at this certain organ or something like that.
2266000	2268000	This is happening in your brain.
2268000	2270000	It's happening in your plumbing of your brain.
2270000	2281000	And, and so you were talking about you're, you're sitting with a scrapbook with your mom, like a photo, photo scrapbook and going through it with her.
2281000	2285000	And you, I mean, do you want to finish this?
2285000	2295000	Yeah, I mean, well, well, basically, well, I'm the errand, I mean, on Aaron's thing, I, it's sucks because I actually don't like when people cry.
2295000	2296000	Right.
2296000	2301000	And it's a response I don't actually have a lot because there's some emotional damage to.
2301000	2302000	Well, that was going to be my next question.
2302000	2304000	But first of all, don't worry about us.
2304000	2305000	That's why you're up here.
2305000	2307000	Actually, I just, I don't want laughs.
2307000	2308000	I just want a cathartic experience.
2308000	2309000	Sure.
2309000	2315000	Well, with Aaron, though, what I told her last week was I've been trying to find a cheap way around the drawing.
2315000	2322000	So what I'll do is I'll take a blue pencil and I'll just keep drawing shapes, you know, like circles or whatever.
2322000	2331000	And once it's in a position to where I think there's something there, I take a regular pencil, go over it and then I've made like the side of the face and then I'll do more circles in blue.
2331000	2332000	And then I'll trace that again.
2332000	2334000	And it's, it's weird.
2334000	2341000	It's not foolproof yet, but it's like I'm, I hate being told I can't like my first doctors were like, you can't, you're not going to walk.
2341000	2342000	You're not going to talk.
2342000	2343000	And I'm like, bullshit.
2343000	2347000	Like my life isn't going to be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life.
2347000	2352000	Like I'm not going to just sit and be someone that my mom puts on the porch to watch cars go by while she's at work.
2352000	2356000	You know, like I'm not just that I'm going to be something else.
2356000	2371000	Like if I'm not going to be the old me, I'm going to be a new me, you know, for that reason.
2371000	2380000	But you talked about like going, going through the photo album and, and I mean, the thing that like made my heart like leap up into my throat or down into my groin or whatever.
2380000	2385000	It was the, was the, you said, the way I remember you saying it is having no visual memory.
2385000	2395000	You're going through a photo scrapbook with your mom and you're, and she's saying, this is, this is when we did this and you're, and you're, and you're basically having to take her word for it.
2395000	2399000	Like, you know intellectually that she's your mom, but you don't actually.
2399000	2401000	She wasn't lying when she said I'm your mom.
2401000	2406000	Right. There's no reason to be the lowest stakes con game in the world.
2406000	2410000	They're not getting away with a lot in their Swiss bank account.
2410000	2415000	But even with your mother, you're, you're seeing her for the first time every time you see her and it's simply memories.
2415000	2418000	Every time you're not forming new visual memories of her.
2418000	2425000	It's a, it's a lot of that. And so as you said, so then you said like your life here in LA has span the last five, six years.
2425000	2427000	So I remember them knowledge wise.
2427000	2435000	Like I know that I used to P out here and I, but I couldn't tell you visually what the person I paid for looks like, but I have the knowledge of it.
2435000	2444000	But ironically, this horrible empty desert, you know, where we all come to like put our emotional lives on hold while we try to get ahead in the world.
2444000	2446000	This is actually your cradle of memory.
2446000	2451000	This is the, this is, this is as close as you have to home because this is the place you've been for six years.
2451000	2453000	This is, this is your family.
2453000	2457000	I mean, I mean, this is where I, I got back up on my feet.
2457000	2461000	And, you know, I recently, like a year ago, got how to get my driver's license back.
2461000	2464000	So yeah, this is where I rebuilt, you know.
2464000	2473000	So I mean, we have to go to the deepest place of all, like, like what, what have they told you in terms of prognosis?
2473000	2478000	Have they given you, have they told you what to expect in terms of mortality?
2478000	2480000	I, at first I didn't want to know.
2480000	2482000	So I kept telling them not to tell me.
2482000	2489000	And then it got to a point at Christmas time this past year where I think it was the first time because they couldn't figure out what happened.
2489000	2492000	Like right after the aneurysm, they were normal.
2492000	2497000	Normally you'll go through a state of depression and like, you know, some of the outcomes of it are fatigued.
2497000	2498000	You get tired.
2498000	2500000	You know, there's a lot of like things like that.
2500000	2501000	I'm always in pain.
2501000	2503000	I've had a headache every single day.
2503000	2511000	So trying to deal with people and with a smile is like probably, I think I found a way to do it with ease for once.
2511000	2513000	But at first it was really hard.
2513000	2519000	And then I think, I'm sorry, I actually forgot the original question.
2519000	2521000	Well, I mean, did they tell you?
2521000	2522000	Oh, yeah.
2522000	2524000	So then I said, well, I don't want to know.
2524000	2527000	And then in Christmas time they were like, well, we found three more in your head.
2527000	2530000	And to me, I don't know the actual comparison.
2530000	2531000	It is a comparison.
2531000	2535000	I was like, well, one of these things almost killed me.
2535000	2538000	So I was like, well, this is like my Vietnam.
2538000	2540000	And now I have three of them.
2540000	2549000	And I'm like, so I may have proved that I'm tough on one level, but I'm not going to survive three if this happens again.
2549000	2551000	And then luckily they've died down.
2551000	2556000	We did a couple procedures, you know, and I'm back to, you know, doing okay.
2557000	2561000	So for all anyone knows, because you're such a weird mystery to these people.
2561000	2562000	Yeah.
2562000	2563000	I mean, I could still go.
2563000	2565000	I could not wake up tomorrow morning.
2565000	2573000	Or you could be the four aneurysm guy whose last three they caught because you're such an oddball.
2573000	2577000	Also, it's so mysterious is that you're standing up here and you look like you could be anybody in the room.
2577000	2580000	It's not like you look debilitated.
2580000	2583000	You say inwardly you're in pain and stuff like that.
2583000	2584000	Yeah.
2584000	2586000	Sometimes you'll notice I hunch.
2586000	2593000	It's hard sometimes to make eye contact because there's someone try to explain to me like a low level of autism because sometimes they have that.
2593000	2596000	But I feel when I'm comfortable around people, it's not a big deal.
2596000	2600000	But crowds, I can kind of just feel all the attention.
2600000	2601000	You're at Zertmelt.
2601000	2604000	There's no eye contact going on here.
2604000	2606000	You found the right place.
2606000	2608000	If you want to be looked at, dress like shoelaces.
2608000	2609000	Yeah.
2614000	2618000	If you want to be looked at, dress like shoelaces.
2618000	2630000	Is there, I mean, I want to ask you, I hope you're not offended by my characterization of you as somebody who is tethered to us but somewhere else.
2630000	2636000	Somewhere beyond the place that we have the luxury of just not thinking about in line at the bank.
2636000	2639000	I was like, oh shit, I had a bad day today.
2639000	2641000	Should I propose to my girlfriend?
2641000	2642000	I don't know.
2642000	2643000	Maybe I will.
2643000	2644000	Maybe I won't.
2644000	2646000	Oh, my car's out of gas.
2646000	2661000	Like there's always this like independence day flying saucer hovering in the sky that is blacking out the sun but completely ignorable day to day for all of us,
2661000	2671000	which is that we live minute to minute, second to second by the grace of some completely unforgiving, absolutely inhuman thing.
2671000	2683000	And I just, like, we just don't, like, it's uncomfortable to ask people who are further in the clutches of this thing, further at its mercy in a demonstrable way.
2683000	2687000	But it seems important to ask, like, what do we do?
2687000	2689000	How do we feel?
2689000	2690000	How do you feel?
2690000	2698000	What message can you give to us that in any way, like, lets us stop fucking around?
2698000	2699000	I don't know.
2700000	2701000	I don't know.
2701000	2707000	I, you know, oh, by the way, Soul Star has his powers on page one.
2707000	2709000	None of that page ten.
2709000	2711000	So get your powers before page twenty.
2711000	2712000	Yeah.
2712000	2715000	Speed it up, Hollywood.
2715000	2717000	Yeah.
2717000	2719000	You know, I don't know.
2719000	2725000	There's a message in the book that I think resonates, which I tell people all the time.
2725000	2728000	It's just give more to the world than what you take.
2728000	2729000	Yeah.
2729000	2730000	You know, it's I don't know.
2730000	2731000	There's no right answer.
2731000	2732000	There's no wrong answer.
2732000	2736000	I just, you know, just do what you love and don't hurt anyone.
2736000	2743000	It sounds generic, but it's like I mean, I'm not I'm at the point now where I don't I'm not afraid of if I don't wake up tomorrow.
2743000	2748000	I still try to do everything I want to do in a day that I physically can.
2748000	2754000	And and then I just hope it's enough, you know, and I think that's all any of us can do.
2755000	2760000	There's no, you know, there's no cosmic right answer here.
2760000	2762000	I think that was it. I think that does it.
2762000	2765000	Give more than you than you take.
2765000	2768000	That absolutely has to be the answer.
2768000	2776000	And I know it's under all our noses, but like we don't believe it when our mom says it because she's in the kitchen making cookies.
2776000	2783000	And we need we need heroes to take the trek and call back over their shoulder.
2783000	2788000	This is this is the truth. It was interesting when you told me that last week because I never heard.
2788000	2792000	I've heard people try to describe me and normally I don't like it.
2792000	2799000	Well, you look like you and McGregor just so you know.
2799000	2800000	I would love to see some of your art.
2800000	2806000	Is there a way that we can commission some for like for for us or for something that we can like get to see something you draw?
2806000	2812000	Can we can we see like I want to see the blue like test lines that are inked in later on.
2812000	2814000	That sounds fascinating to me. Yeah.
2814000	2816000	My dad's a really good artist, but he's really sketchy.
2816000	2820000	I watch him draw and he would draw a million lines really light, really light, really light.
2820000	2823000	And then he would see he would honing a woman and draw a line.
2823000	2827000	It was covered in lines and then he would find it.
2827000	2828000	That sounds exactly like that.
2828000	2831000	That's kind of in a way like mentally how I approach a lot of things.
2831000	2835000	So I love to see visually that that art approach.
2835000	2836000	It's just trial by error.
2836000	2841000	I mean, the way I look at it is if I have to physically see something to draw it, then I'll just keep drawing it until makes sense.
2841000	2847000	You know, like I tried looking at things and there seems to be a slight translation disconnect.
2847000	2849000	But I I'm getting better at it.
2849000	2856000	Like if someone sat in front of me and I could draw their face, it would take a while because I'm actually trying to use a part of the brain that isn't there anymore for me.
2856000	2861000	So it's like you can feel it like when I draw, I feel it like big time.
2861000	2870000	But if you want to feel if you feel the gap that I feel like the strain that it's taking to to transfer this to this with nothing up here, you know.
2870000	2880000	So if you wanted to draw something from memory, like say you wanted to draw like a car or draw a banana or anything, there's nothing you're conjuring up in your head.
2880000	2883000	Is it you're waiting until you see it and that reminds you of.
2883000	2884000	Yeah.
2884000	2886000	Like I cheated recently.
2886000	2887000	I had I have an art show downtown.
2887000	2889000	It's going to end this week.
2889000	2891000	And and I cheated.
2891000	2894000	Someone was standing near me and there was a draw.
2894000	2896000	You know, go over and draw on the wall kind of thing.
2896000	2899000	And I was looking at him and drawing and I just made him a zombie.
2899000	2904000	You know, so I was like, as I'm like doing the circles and stuff, I'm like, a hole was in his cheek, you know.
2904000	2905000	And so I drew a couple teeth there.
2905000	2907000	But I'm looking at him and doing it.
2907000	2909000	And someone was like, oh, my God, you did it for memory.
2909000	2911000	And I just like, I don't know.
2911000	2916000	I felt so nice to hear that that I just I think I I kind of lied and was just like, yeah, cool.
2916000	2920000	And then just to feel like like my old self again, I guess.
2920000	2925000	But now what you're drawing is completely you have to be you're forced to be totally in the moment.
2925000	2928000	You're drawing something for the first time every time.
2928000	2934000	So that to me is like something that can be really like valuable and like like visceral to like look at.
2934000	2938000	Yeah. So what are you complaining about?
2938000	2940000	You've been given this gift.
2940000	2943000	You know, white people with areas of problems.
2943000	2945000	Yeah. Well, that's what I try to do.
2945000	2952000	I mean, I've met people, you know, who who have it much, much worse, you know, who can't didn't get out of that.
2952000	2953000	Is there a community out there?
2953000	2957000	Oh, yeah. There's a great group at UCLA that meets like twice a month.
2957000	2962000	And then there's a group on Facebook that I'm part of that we share our stories on there.
2962000	2968000	And I and I go to, you know, I see us and I meet people who have this, you know, who are going through it.
2968000	2974000	And I, you know, I took some of their stories and I put it in Soul Star just to make the book a little bit more special.
2974000	2980000	And then obviously I give all the proceeds to the aneurysm foundation because that's another way I just want to get back.
2980000	2985000	And, you know, I again, just me trying to give more.
2985000	2990000	I think before I had my aneurysm, I was probably the kind of guy that took enough.
2990000	2993000	And so I kind of look at this as a second chance.
2993000	3002000	Yeah. Yeah. And people can Google the aneurysm foundation if they want to, you know, put, you know, be inspired by this podcast to put something into it.
3002000	3006000	OK, well, thank you so much, Seek, for coming up.
3006000	3009000	We'll have you back.
3015000	3020000	I'm not I'm not a hugger.
3020000	3023000	I'm not going to I don't I don't hug people enough.
3023000	3024000	We've hugged a couple of times.
3024000	3027000	If anybody should be hugged, they should hug Seek.
3027000	3029000	I don't know. It's coming back up. All right.
3029000	3031000	It's coming back up.
3036000	3039000	I want to hug.
3045000	3049000	I want to hug everybody in this room.
3049000	3054000	All right. Well, we're not going to that you see why I flip those segments.
3054000	3060000	I didn't follow that with the complaining about the valet's dollar.
3060000	3064000	Our next segment is called My Favorite Cereals.
3064000	3068000	I think Lucky Charms is underrated.
3068000	3071000	But I I'm I'm I'm I'm I don't know.
3071000	3075000	I'm I'm what am I what am I going to patent our podcast on the back?
3075000	3084000	Like I I I I I I I I feel the fidgeting like it's fucking it's fucking hard to I don't know.
3084000	3089000	I just like I watched you while you were talking to Seek.
3089000	3097000	And also when you talk to anybody about any kind of ailments or anything, you get like really physically like you start like like pulling your hair out on the top of your head.
3097000	3102000	And then you get a huge erection and it's it's it's not it's not appropriate.
3102000	3105000	He's not the word I would have used.
3105000	3108000	I mean, I'm saying it's relative to that.
3108000	3110000	It's intense.
3110000	3114000	Like my penis becomes flushed and gorged.
3114000	3118000	What if you only got an actually huge erection when somebody else was in pain?
3118000	3122000	I think those people exist.
3122000	3124000	There's books about them.
3124000	3130000	And I was saying, like, well, we were talking earlier about the superpower of being deaf or blind.
3130000	3131000	We're talking about deafness.
3131000	3134000	And you were talking about like that.
3134000	3136000	You were describing what would be like for you to be deaf.
3136000	3139000	I had this weird empathetic or sympathetic.
3139000	3140000	I'm not sure what the word is.
3140000	3142000	Pain thing where someone says they have a knee injury.
3142000	3143000	My knee hurts.
3143000	3147000	And if someone says they stub their toe, I'll wince because my I'll actually feel it in my.
3147000	3153000	Well, I mean, I mean, I think, you know, not not to undercut your, you know, I think that that's a natural.
3153000	3155000	Like sympathy.
3155000	3158000	It's an invitation to us.
3158000	3161000	And yet it can be repellent.
3161000	3171000	I think that, you know, I've talked to people who are wheelchair bound for whatever reason at like WGA panels and stuff like that.
3171000	3178000	Someone came up to me once and was like, hey, where's the physically I don't even know the politically correct phrases anymore.
3178000	3179000	Can I please just communicate?
3179000	3182000	Where's the physically disabled person in community?
3182000	3184000	And I and I was like, you're right.
3184000	3188000	Jesus Christ like like like it's so hard to do comedy about this stuff, though.
3188000	3191000	But it would be but but therefore it's so relieving when you do do it.
3191000	3193000	And I started I started talking a little bit.
3193000	3211000	You know, it was like people people come into come into the room in a wheelchair and you're you're the flood of of I don't want that to be happening to you that you feel when you see someone in any kind of condition.
3212000	3217000	Can shut off like a like a surge of electricity.
3217000	3222000	It just could throw all these circuits and result in people treating you like a living ghost.
3222000	3226000	And seek is saying he's talking about migraines and I have friends that have migraines.
3226000	3230000	But you're talking about your inability to even make eye contact when that's happening.
3230000	3232000	It's like like I start wincing.
3232000	3233000	Now we're both wincing.
3233000	3235000	Now it looks like I don't like care.
3235000	3246000	And I get that then it just becomes like the thing is like it's like it's I think we all have our own incredibly like like intense physical or emotional response to that stuff.
3246000	3247000	Yeah. Well sympathy.
3247000	3248000	That's what it is.
3248000	3249000	I like you.
3249000	3251000	It's so many so many.
3251000	3253000	And it's so it's weird because it's like you can go on the Internet.
3253000	3258000	You can look at little animated gifts of babies getting run over by minivans in China.
3258000	3260000	And you and you you can.
3260000	3261000	You can't.
3261000	3270000	And like we look at gore videos like we see we see skateboarders crack up and you go.
3270000	3272000	You experience what they're experiencing.
3272000	3281000	But like we we have this potential with our forebrain to turn that into toxic apathy.
3281000	3290000	Like well that I'm going to be punk rock like this is nothing new at all like like like people like like ever since we became sentient apes.
3290000	3295000	We have been afraid of the thing we realized was going to happen to us which is that we were going to die.
3295000	3300000	And the first thing we immediately started doing is we started worshiping death.
3300000	3308000	You worship things that you fear like you know they look like like the tribal mentality is to like take like a big scary monster.
3308000	3319000	Put it put it on your head and dance around the campfire and go like you know this guy's not going to fuck with me or I'm harnessing its power because I'm wearing it.
3319000	3322000	And it's the thing that ate the universe and it's going to eat it again.
3322000	3327000	And you try as hard as you can to atone with these things that scare you the most.
3327000	3341000	But you also like like in so doing you can like it's like you know that jaded gothy fucking like you know I'm going to pierce my face and put a finger on my forehead and I don't fucking care about life.
3341000	3343000	I'm gonna fucking die.
3343000	3354000	You know like it's not it's sort of like you know are you really handling it like like jadedness is also not it's not dealing with death.
3354000	3361000	It's not dealing with with pain like like feeling it is like we have we have we have tear ducts in our eyes.
3361000	3364000	They squirt water when we get upset.
3364000	3366000	But you're not you're not really a crier or a hugger.
3366000	3367000	You're not an emotional guy.
3367000	3368000	No I'm a huge crier.
3368000	3370000	I cried at the end of Doc Hollywood.
3370000	3374000	I just I'll cry and I'll cry at the top of a hat.
3374000	3377000	I just if I let myself feel stuff I'll cry.
3377000	3378000	Why aren't you a hugger.
3378000	3380000	What's because I know because I'll start crying.
3380000	3382000	I fucking hugged me and I started crying.
3382000	3383000	What are you retarded.
3383000	3384000	Oh sorry.
3384000	3385000	Sorry.
3385000	3386000	All right.
3386000	3389000	Learn nothing.
3389000	3393000	My sisters retarded and if I think about that I'll cry.
3393000	3394000	All right.
3394000	3402000	Is that why you do all this stuff Dan to keep everything in arms length that you won't just be a big heap like a big you know weeping mess in the corner.
3402000	3404000	Well I mean yes.
3404000	3405000	Let's let's play judges.
3405000	3408000	We're going to talk about it.
3408000	3410000	I mean that's why we all do everything.
3410000	3415000	We all we all love each other and we all feel connected to each other and it hurts all the time.
3415000	3422000	And we all feel we all feel that fear that if we let it if we let ourselves feel it for a second that we would we would die.
3422000	3428000	Yeah that's my thing is I like I people say like I mean I'm either really close to you or I'm really aloof.
3428000	3431000	I'm really like I keep like I'm the Heisman trophy.
3431000	3442000	I keep everybody at our arms length and I hold a couple of things close and like and like I am very aloof because if I let people in that I just will cry all the time.
3442000	3446000	I'm a huge antenna for people's pain and there's anything hurt in the room.
3446000	3448000	It's like I like it.
3448000	3455000	I have to like push everything away in the suit is it is armor and my voice and my gestures.
3455000	3463000	Everything is a way to deflect and keep everything at some sort of distance because if they get close it's it's close and that's it's incredibly well it gets messy.
3463000	3476000	I mean like like seek said like he's experiencing like symptoms of autism because of his aneurysm like and one of those symptoms is that when he feels he's standing in a room full of people like he can feel everything and like it's overwhelming.
3476000	3484000	It's a common misconception misconception that that autistic people people on the spectrum like they don't have empathy.
3484000	3494000	They don't have feelings like like like like a lot of them will complain that when they walk into a party they they are flooded with bullshit like just feedback.
3494000	3506000	It's like holding a microphone up to a speaker because and that is what results in the appearance of lack of empathy because you have to you have to put up a brick wall to to keep it out.
3506000	3513000	But I'm just just like and I can't even look out because like my vantage point for the podcast listeners is I'm I'm kind of facing the stage.
3513000	3516000	I'm kind of facing the audience and peripherally on both sides.
3516000	3520000	I just see people having bodily reactions throughout the entire thing is I can't even look.
3520000	3530000	I see people like like there's just certain physical reactions people have and it's like it's so and also like there's no need to make any any jokes out of it.
3530000	3532000	I think it's like it's as interesting as anything else.
3532000	3536000	I'll make one and it's going to be amazing.
3536000	3537000	Is it going to be racist?
3537000	3549000	A pollock and a Jew have an aneurysm together and the pollocks like whoa that's great because he's an idiot.
3549000	3557000	He loves aneurysms and the Jews like oh I wish it were off the rack or rebate discount.
3557000	3566000	All right let's bring Spencer up.
3566000	3570000	For those of you in the Hollywood Reporter read the transcript of my.
3570000	3573000	Hey guys what happened.
3573000	3580000	It is a gauntlet that is not up to fire code.
3580000	3583000	How's it how's it going living with your roommate.
3583000	3588000	It's you know it's kind of like autism.
3588000	3592000	Don't play that card.
3592000	3594000	How's it going at your new job.
3594000	3599000	It's so easy but my boss is a dick.
3599000	3604000	For those of you who don't know Spencer is a newly employed under Dan Harmon's tutelage.
3604000	3606000	He's Dan's assistant.
3606000	3607000	Yeah he's doing.
3607000	3609000	Yeah he's really easy.
3609000	3614000	What does your day consist of like like if you can give us bullet points throughout your throughout your workday.
3614000	3615000	Well what goes on.
3615000	3618000	I roll in around nine thirty nine forty five.
3618000	3622000	I'm extremely early sometimes I'll grab some breakfast in the commissary.
3622000	3625000	There's a commissary.
3625000	3636000	But I know I get to the office and is it an old time me like Hollywood commissary where there's a guy dressed up like a centurion and there's a guy.
3636000	3642000	Always constantly two guys with a giant sheet of plate glass just in case there's a car chase.
3642000	3645000	Back and forth back and forth.
3645000	3647000	It's exactly like that.
3647000	3648000	It's weird.
3648000	3651000	I don't know what's I don't know what those are like.
3651000	3654000	And actually I put that on the list of my things I'm not allowed to complain about.
3654000	3659000	Paramount's commissary which is called the dining room closes at 3 p.m.
3659000	3662000	Call it the lunching room.
3662000	3663000	It closes at 3 p.m.
3663000	3670000	You can't get a drink there when you really need it which is 315.
3670000	3671000	Thank you.
3671000	3672000	Is there booze there too?
3672000	3673000	There is.
3673000	3674000	There's a little bar.
3674000	3675000	It's not what I would call you know.
3675000	3676000	Really.
3676000	3677000	Yeah.
3677000	3678000	It's not like the bar in the love boat.
3678000	3681000	It's not like a cool place to retire.
3681000	3684000	It's funny because like I have a bottle of kettle in my office.
3684000	3688000	And the guy who's paid to pour it for you.
3688000	3691000	That's most of my job you guys.
3691000	3697000	Wait so speaking of love boat are you dressed in a white tux like Isaac?
3697000	3699000	Are you joking?
3699000	3701000	I'm dressed like this.
3701000	3702000	A white tux?
3702000	3705000	Get this guy a tux for fuck sake.
3705000	3709000	I could dress him over where I wanted I guess right?
3709000	3711000	That would be funny.
3711000	3716000	Didn't Zeke's message of give more to the world than what you take land at all to you?
3716000	3717000	Put him in a tuxedo.
3717000	3723000	Well that's why I want to create a situation somehow where I want to get Spencer on camera
3723000	3724000	in community.
3724000	3726000	Like I want him to be like in the show.
3726000	3727000	Why?
3727000	3733000	Like to keep pushing this like I want to see because Spencer so far has proven unflappable.
3733000	3734000	He's grunting in agony.
3734000	3735000	I'm flapping.
3735000	3739000	Well I want to find your flapping point.
3739000	3741000	I want to find your flaps Spencer.
3741000	3743000	I'm not an actor dude.
3743000	3745000	You're not a podcast celebrity.
3745000	3747000	We went on tour and shot that documentary.
3747000	3751000	You didn't blanch from cameras any more than you do from a live audience here.
3751000	3755000	You were yeah I mean that was part of it though.
3755000	3758000	Like you kind of knew going into it that would be an aspect of it right?
3758000	3763000	What if you do it and like you make it through like you're like let's say you do like a little guest star thing on community.
3763000	3771000	Like a little walk on like I'll write a little part where it's like oh and here's my dungeon master and like he'll be like hey how's it going?
3771000	3774000	And then and then like you're off like and we'll see how it goes.
3774000	3778000	We'll see if you go home that night and cut yourself with it.
3778000	3779000	Or is that your plan?
3779000	3784000	I was saying what if that's the point where he starts getting fake tan that goes to the gym a lot.
3784000	3786000	And he comes in and he changes his name.
3786000	3790000	Well then I'll hand him off as a mentee to Joel McHale.
3790000	3795000	Like Joel, Joel will take you from there and like welcome you into the world of being an Adonis.
3795000	3800000	You know like he'll show you crunches and do the one almond for breakfast diet.
3800000	3802000	Oh man.
3802000	3807000	What if you're only like like eight months away from like dating Mila Kunis or something like that?
3807000	3809000	That's weird.
3809000	3811000	Everything's weird.
3811000	3815000	I'm just gonna be passed around by famous people.
3815000	3816000	Yes.
3816000	3821000	Just just just hauled up to this Mayan pyramid where eventually you'll get your head cut off, right?
3821000	3824000	Everyone's squished.
3824000	3828000	Because the moon and the sun are...
3828000	3830000	You'll find out the joke has breaded you the whole time.
3830000	3835000	It's just simply an elaborate suicide murder thing.
3835000	3837000	Oh man.
3837000	3840000	So speaking of weird things, Aaron can't be here tonight.
3840000	3841000	Right.
3841000	3842000	She's in a show.
3842000	3846000	Kumail is, well to quote his wife Emily,
3846000	3851000	Hot Tub Time Machine 2 isn't gonna shoot itself.
3851000	3852000	He's on set.
3852000	3854000	He's at work.
3854000	3857000	Hot Tub Time Machine 2.
3857000	3860000	That's gonna answer so many questions from that first one.
3860000	3862000	The title was ironic when they came up with it.
3862000	3865000	But then they made a sequel and now it's like okay it doesn't get to be ironic.
3865000	3868000	Now you're actually making Hot Tub Time Machine 2.
3868000	3870000	By the way, this is the end is awesome.
3870000	3871000	I can't wait till it comes out of video.
3871000	3873000	Alright.
3873000	3874000	Oh boy.
3874000	3876000	I've never been so excited about a movie.
3876000	3877000	What is?
3877000	3878000	Oh this is the end.
3878000	3879000	This is the end.
3879000	3880000	I can't stop blowing that movie.
3880000	3881000	Anyways.
3881000	3882000	That was a good movie.
3882000	3884000	It was so funny.
3884000	3887000	Okay.
3887000	3889000	But what I decided is we're not doing...
3889000	3891000	We're going back to the basics.
3891000	3894000	I hope you can manage it narratively.
3894000	3896000	It's just me and Jeff this time.
3896000	3903000	The other characters can either be come in tow as NPCs or they wink out of existence
3903000	3906000	but I just want to get back to the roots man.
3906000	3907000	Man.
3907000	3908000	It's time we did.
3908000	3909000	Yeah.
3909000	3910000	What do you think about that Spencer?
3910000	3913000	I think that's a great plan.
3913000	3917000	Oh when he goes into that voice ladies and gentlemen it can only mean one thing.
3917000	3920000	Oh can it?
3920000	3921000	It means that...
3921000	3924000	We're also starting unseasonably early in the show.
3924000	3925000	Well that's good.
3925000	3927000	I haven't carried on this long.
3927000	3928000	Who knows?
3928000	3929000	Yeah.
3929000	3932000	How much dungeon did you create for this?
3932000	3933000	Let's find out.
3933000	3935000	I charged north as fast as I can.
3935000	3940000	Well I mean we found out we play a private session at Dan's place.
3940000	3941000	You call it a private...
3941000	3946000	It's just a regular ass game.
3946000	3951000	All D&D games are just these public affairs.
3951000	3957000	The only time I've ever played one was when it's publicly consumable via live audience
3957000	3958000	or broadcast.
3958000	3960000	This is a private affair.
3960000	3961000	I get.
3961000	3962000	Meaning no black people.
3962000	3963000	No Asian people.
3963000	3964000	I'm kidding.
3964000	3965000	It's a private...
3965000	3966000	Yeah.
3966000	3967000	It's a private affair.
3967000	3972000	But we found out last time Dan got reprimanded for metagaming.
3972000	3973000	Metagaming.
3973000	3975000	Can we talk about that?
3975000	3977000	Sure.
3977000	3980000	Since it makes you uncharacteristically excited.
3980000	3981000	Yeah.
3981000	3983000	Talk about what a fuck up I am.
3983000	3984000	No.
3984000	3985000	That's the whole...
3985000	3986000	That's what I want to talk about.
3986000	3987000	Is that's...
3987000	3988000	I get yelled at for metagaming.
3988000	3989000	I didn't yell and...
3989000	3990000	No, no, no.
3990000	3991000	Let him talk about it Dan.
3991000	3995000	The whole thing is I want to talk about this defense mechanism you're throwing up.
3995000	3997000	That's the real...
3997000	3998000	No.
3998000	3999000	Okay.
3999000	4000000	Spencer.
4000000	4001000	Hollywood has changed you man.
4001000	4002000	Oh I know.
4002000	4003000	After this I got...
4003000	4009000	Throwed words around like commissary like...
4009000	4012560	Cafeteria is another word for it but that doesn't sound cool.
4012560	4014320	I didn't even finish explaining the job.
4014320	4015320	I don't care.
4015320	4016320	That's pretty...
4016320	4017320	I get him drinks.
4017320	4018320	What else do you do?
4018320	4019320	You get me drinks?
4019320	4020320	Yeah.
4020320	4021320	Nice.
4021320	4022320	You sit in the writers room.
4022320	4023320	Yeah.
4023320	4024320	The writers love you.
4024320	4025320	Sometimes Spencer will call out a word very discreetly.
4025320	4028840	Like, hey, you know, he'll be like, giraffe.
4028840	4031640	You know, like when we're stuck, you know.
4031640	4032800	And then like we'll use it.
4032800	4033800	Yeah.
4033800	4035640	I thought I would get in trouble but I don't know.
4035640	4038000	Now you have to join the guild.
4039000	4043000	Oh, I was thinking of the guild of calamitous intent.
4045000	4047000	See, you can take the Hollywood...
4047000	4049000	No, you can take the Spencer...
4049000	4051000	What do you think about my story breaking method?
4051000	4052000	Well, okay.
4052000	4054000	So, oh, yeah, that's awesome.
4054000	4055000	I mean, I...
4055000	4056000	You were kind of blown away weren't you?
4056000	4060000	I was blown away by how organic it was.
4060000	4062000	It's just very natural.
4062000	4065000	It's kind of how I come up with ideas but I don't have a room of people.
4065000	4067000	I just have, you know, all the voices in my head.
4069000	4070000	It's pretty impressive.
4070000	4071000	Me.
4071000	4072000	Yeah.
4073000	4074000	You're a good person.
4074000	4076000	Dan's a good person.
4076000	4079000	I'm talented.
4079000	4081000	I would say extremely talented.
4081000	4082000	Thank you.
4082000	4086000	I mean, I don't know where it's coming from.
4086000	4087000	Thank you.
4087000	4088000	Anyway, does it...
4088000	4089000	What is your story breaking method?
4089000	4091000	Is that a secret out of school?
4091000	4095000	You know what Simon & Schuster will tell you in the spring of February 2017
4095000	4098000	and I'll charge you $20 a copy.
4098000	4099000	I'm not kidding.
4099000	4100000	I don't know.
4100000	4101000	We can't go into that now.
4101000	4102000	It's $9.19.
4102000	4104000	$9.19, is it?
4104000	4107000	Let's just say it's very organic and very primal.
4107000	4111000	Spencer, tell us what happened last week at our...
4111000	4113000	Does everyone know what metagaming is?
4113000	4114000	Not everyone knows.
4114000	4116000	That's a terrible question.
4116000	4120000	Does anyone by applause know what metagaming is?
4120000	4122000	Jesus Christ.
4122000	4126000	Okay, for everybody else, in Dungeons & Dragons, sometimes the characters don't know stuff
4126000	4129000	that the person who plays the character does.
4129000	4133000	For instance, if a character came up with what you in the real world know as a camera,
4133000	4136000	your character wouldn't know what a camera is because he's never seen one before,
4136000	4139000	even though it's pretty regular technology, right?
4139000	4141000	So it would not make sense to be like, oh, that's a camera.
4141000	4143000	So that's metagaming, essentially.
4143000	4144000	There's different ways it comes out.
4144000	4146000	Anyway, they were fighting a monster.
4146000	4147000	It was a bed.
4147000	4151000	It was a sticky bed.
4151000	4152000	It was a bed that...
4152000	4154000	Which everyone has knowledge of.
4154000	4155000	Yeah, everybody.
4155000	4156000	But it jumped around.
4156000	4157000	It started sticking to people.
4157000	4159000	It was tackling folks.
4159000	4165000	And I let slip to Rob Schwab, who had his first edition monster manual,
4165000	4166000	that it was a monster in there.
4166000	4169000	And I pointed it to him because I wanted some nerd cred, you know?
4169000	4171000	But that was my mistake.
4171000	4173000	And I caught...
4173000	4175000	You know, I admit fully to that.
4175000	4176000	That was terrible on my part.
4176000	4182000	But he showed you, and then you tried to play it off like you were an old hand,
4182000	4184000	who's just like, oh, yeah, a mimic.
4184000	4185000	That's what that is.
4185000	4187000	You know, mimics, they love this.
4187000	4188000	I didn't know this.
4188000	4189000	I wasn't trying to play anything off.
4189000	4190000	I apologize.
4190000	4191000	That was the air I got from you.
4191000	4192000	Well, no, no.
4192000	4193000	I thought that was really awesome.
4193000	4196000	I swear to God, I wasn't trying to deceive or anything like that.
4196000	4198000	Yeah, no, he didn't know anything was wrong.
4198000	4200000	I thought what happened was...
4200000	4203000	Granted, I'm very drunk during all of these things.
4203000	4205000	Called days.
4208000	4209000	I...
4209000	4210000	Oh, boy.
4210000	4213000	Okay, when you were describing the monster, Robert the Monster Manual,
4213000	4215000	I thought that I knew what it was.
4215000	4218000	I thought it was like a trapper or something like that.
4218000	4221000	Something like words like a carpet or...
4221000	4223000	And I was like, oh, I think I know what this is.
4223000	4227000	And I looked it up in the thing and noticed that the page that had the succubus illustration
4227000	4230000	was torn out of his Monster Manual.
4231000	4234000	For those of you who know what that means.
4236000	4238000	But I was like, oh, shit, I don't think this is it.
4238000	4240000	Then I diverted...
4240000	4245000	My attention was taken by booze and, you know, cake and whatever.
4245000	4251000	Then at a certain point, Rob, like, elbowed me and was pointing at the mimic.
4251000	4252000	I thought that...
4252000	4254000	I didn't know that you had pointed it out.
4254000	4255000	Yeah, no, I know that.
4255000	4256000	Definitely.
4256000	4257000	Okay.
4257000	4258000	I thought that Rob had found it.
4258000	4259000	Yeah.
4259000	4262000	I thought we were collectively like, oh, if we...
4262000	4267000	And in my day, it was called table talk and kind of game knowledge or whatever.
4267000	4268000	It was a boring conversation.
4268000	4271000	Yeah, well, in dance time, it was the DM versus the player.
4271000	4275000	So the DM would try to fuck you up and then you'd have to look at the Monster Manual
4275000	4276000	to stand a chance.
4276000	4277000	So it's kind of...
4277000	4278000	It makes sense.
4278000	4282000	But anyway, the end result was he was like, oh, mimics are weak against food.
4282000	4285000	If you give him food, he'll stop fighting.
4285000	4290000	And that is kind of flagrant over the line of metagaming.
4290000	4292000	So I was like, okay, I got to explain this concept.
4292000	4294000	And I explained it very poorly.
4294000	4299000	And then I think that you, Dan, just thought I was trying to punish you,
4299000	4300000	but I was just trying to explain it.
4300000	4303000	Dan doesn't like being told what to do or that he did something wrong.
4303000	4304000	Yeah, definitely.
4304000	4306000	And he looked at you the rest of the game, which is like...
4306000	4309000	Like he wanted to stab your face in the dick.
4309000	4310000	Oh, come on.
4311000	4316000	But his hatred of being told that he did something wrong
4316000	4320000	met with his clear respect for what you do and who you are.
4320000	4323000	And he just sat there looking like little poopy britches.
4323000	4325000	But there was no way of knowing.
4325000	4328000	I wasn't doing it to be punitive just to explain a concept
4328000	4330000	that would have otherwise been hard to illustrate.
4330000	4333000	Well, the easy rule, first of all, is nobody should be reading the Monster Manual
4333000	4334000	during the game.
4334000	4336000	That's an easy rule to understand.
4336000	4338000	But then we get into this metagaming thing.
4338000	4341000	It's like the difference between metagaming and what we used to call table talk,
4341000	4344000	which is if I walk into a room, if you and I walk into a room
4344000	4348000	and we see a troll that's holding a staff with a red ruby on the top of it,
4348000	4351000	if I, in all of my 20 years of playing Dungeons and Dragons,
4351000	4354000	go, oh, that might be a fireball wand.
4354000	4360000	Like, is that metagaming, if I'm just talking to another player,
4360000	4363000	I'm not saying to the other character blah, blah, blah.
4363000	4364000	So the line gets blurry.
4365000	4369000	So what I decided is I'm just going to be immersed in my character all the time.
4369000	4372000	That way I'll never be at risk of metagaming.
4372000	4373000	Yeah.
4373000	4375000	But that scenario you explained wasn't metagaming.
4375000	4377000	Like, table talk can still happen.
4377000	4380000	It just can't, like, inexplicably cross the bound.
4380000	4384000	Then your character would have to be all like, oh, a wand of thing.
4384000	4387000	Like, I saw that dude shooting fireballs out of earlier.
4387000	4389000	Then it would make sense that your character would know.
4389000	4391000	But if you're like, oh, that's a wand of fireball
4391000	4393000	because my player who plays me knows, I still don't get it.
4393000	4395000	You just confused me again.
4395000	4398000	Because if I say to another player, if I haven't done anything,
4398000	4401000	I say to another player, oh, that might be a wand of fireballs.
4401000	4402000	If we don't...
4402000	4405000	Outside of your character, that's metagaming you shouldn't do.
4405000	4408000	No, that's not metagaming. That's just talking.
4408000	4410000	Wait, no, I'm confused.
4410000	4414000	Okay, metagaming only pertains to your character actions.
4414000	4416000	So anything you, Jeff, does is fine.
4416000	4419000	Oh, but we can do sidebars with each other and say,
4419000	4421000	I think it sounds like a thing thing.
4421000	4424000	Yeah, but then your character would have to come up with an in-character reason
4424000	4426000	to be taking that course of action.
4426000	4431000	Well, I think you'll find, if you look back, that I have never metagamed.
4433000	4437000	But I will be in character if I agree.
4438000	4440000	Otherwise, you're fired.
4441000	4444000	You know, when I was agreeing with you in the writer's room,
4444000	4447000	I actually did agree. I wasn't just trying to grease things along.
4447000	4449000	You were right in that instance.
4449000	4451000	Sorry, I want... This is exciting.
4451000	4453000	I want your relationship, business-wise and friendship-wise,
4453000	4457000	to go so far that one day he just supplants you.
4457000	4460000	Me too. That's called an apprenticeship.
4461000	4463000	But you have to be allowed to let that happen.
4463000	4466000	And I know you're going to fight like a dragon.
4466000	4468000	That makes me a worthy mentor, doesn't it?
4468000	4470000	You're going to try to thwart him.
4470000	4473000	You think Obi-Wan would have been good at his job if Luke came into his cave
4473000	4475000	and was just like, oh, thanks for this lightsaber,
4475000	4477000	warp and cut him in half?
4478000	4481000	Yeah, but Obi-Wan let himself be cut in half so that Luke...
4481000	4484000	By a dude that's like super evil and powerful.
4484000	4487000	Right, but I'm saying you're not going to go down that easy.
4487000	4489000	You go down easy.
4491000	4493000	You are going to go down easy.
4493000	4496000	Well, it costs $20, same as in town.
4497000	4499000	Can we please get to the matter at hand?
4499000	4501000	All right, let's do this. Spencer, ready?
4501000	4502000	Yeah.
4503000	4508000	When we last met, the gang was in the midst of Yellow Camp,
4508000	4511000	which was under demonic occupation.
4511000	4513000	After rushing into the camp,
4513000	4516000	our heroes encountered and dispatched a bearded devil
4516000	4520000	before entangling a group of slimy Lemurs.
4520000	4523000	The heroes freed a couple of the barbarians
4523000	4528000	and met with Slab Squat Thrust, the half-orc cleric.
4528000	4531000	The team reacquainted themselves with Slab,
4531000	4534000	and they formed packs with each other and stuff
4534000	4538000	before catching the attention of a second bearded devil.
4538000	4541000	Sharpie said no.
4541000	4544000	The devil heeded not their threats.
4544000	4547000	The gang tried synchronized in performance art
4547000	4550000	with the attempt of ending the devil's threat.
4550000	4552000	The devil heeded not the art.
4552000	4554000	Mulrain and Quark attempted to gift the devil
4554000	4557000	with a potentially lethal necklace.
4557000	4560000	The devil heeded not the gift.
4560000	4563000	The gang resorted to violence.
4563000	4566000	Violence worked.
4566000	4568000	But during the combat,
4568000	4573000	Mulrain turned and stabbed Slab Squat Thrust in the face.
4573000	4575000	The demon was slain.
4575000	4578000	But afterwards, at the end of the combat,
4578000	4580000	the group turned to survey their ranks
4580000	4584000	and saw Mulrain holding a bloody dagger next to a bleeding,
4584000	4586000	dying Slab Squat Thrust.
4586000	4590000	What will they do with the friendly fire in their ranks?
4590000	4593000	We'll find out.
4593000	4595000	Next.
4602000	4604000	Chicken out, Friday.
4604000	4607000	Alright, so Slab Squat Thrust got killed?
4607000	4609000	Oh, he's dying currently.
4609000	4610000	Alright.
4610000	4613000	Well, Mulrain, why'd you do that?
4613000	4616000	I don't like him.
4616000	4617000	Alright, fair enough.
4617000	4620000	He was a stranger.
4620000	4623000	She did it because he, I don't know,
4623000	4625000	he joined in a pact with me.
4625000	4626000	I was never quite clear on it.
4626000	4627000	He was on our side.
4627000	4630000	He was pack blocking.
4630000	4632000	You dirty pack blocker.
4632000	4635000	Alright, so are we looking at other foes right now?
4635000	4636000	Not right now.
4636000	4638000	We gotta go find your father.
4638000	4639000	We gotta find my dad.
4639000	4641000	We gotta go find Lord Butz a lot.
4641000	4642000	That's true.
4642000	4646000	Is there any intelligence we can gain from any of these people?
4646000	4648000	Are there barbarians around us?
4648000	4649000	There are barbarians.
4649000	4652000	You freed a couple and they were freeing more barbarians
4652000	4654000	while you were fighting demons and stuff.
4654000	4655000	Are they Butz a lot?
4655000	4657000	They are Butz a lot, but there's some of the gnolls.
4657000	4658000	Alright.
4658000	4659000	Butz a lot.
4659000	4660000	Gnolls.
4660000	4661000	Where is my father?
4661000	4665000	I am Sharpie Butz a lot.
4665000	4668000	They all kind of talk to each other and they're like,
4668000	4670000	thanks for saving us.
4670000	4674000	I don't know though.
4674000	4678000	One of the gnolls kind of breaks rank and kind of walks up to you
4678000	4681000	and you recognize him as a gnoll that you've met before.
4681000	4685000	His yellowed fur is smelly and filthy
4685000	4687000	and you recognize him as Yurch.
4687000	4691000	He was a guy who I think he showed you to your dad.
4691000	4692000	I don't know. It happened.
4692000	4693000	Stuff happened.
4693000	4694000	You remember him from the past.
4694000	4695000	Yeah.
4695000	4696000	Yurch!
4696000	4697000	Yurch!
4697000	4698000	The pea soaked.
4698000	4702000	Where is my father?
4702000	4706000	I think he's in that pit over there.
4706000	4707000	He's in a pit?
4707000	4708000	I think.
4708000	4710000	I look to where he's pointing.
4710000	4713000	He's pointing at a pit.
4713000	4716000	But between the pit and you are the lemures
4716000	4718000	that you had entangled by vines.
4718000	4720000	They're kind of still entangled.
4720000	4723000	They haven't made much progress against these vines.
4723000	4724000	So they're still alive.
4724000	4727000	They're alive, but they're like as if they're in a net.
4727000	4728000	How many are there?
4728000	4730000	There's seven.
4730000	4731000	What is cleave?
4731000	4732000	I have a new power called cleave.
4732000	4735000	That'll help you hit two people at once.
4735000	4737000	Is it worthwhile?
4737000	4738000	Yeah, let's just wipe them out.
4738000	4742000	Okay, I charged towards the entangled.
4742000	4743000	Oh, wait.
4743000	4744000	Well, if you're going to be up close,
4744000	4745000	let me do a fireball first.
4745000	4746000	Okay, okay.
4746000	4748000	They're immune to fire, remember?
4748000	4749000	No.
4749000	4752000	Adam Goldberg called out, they're immune to fire.
4752000	4756000	These leomars, what are they called?
4756000	4758000	Lemures.
4758000	4763000	I charge in with my sword, cleave.
4763000	4765000	All right.
4765000	4768000	All right.
4768000	4769000	All right.
4769000	4773000	It's like Barry White is dungeon mastering right now.
4773000	4774000	Stuff's happening.
4774000	4776000	Yeah, girl.
4776000	4779000	Cleave those lemures.
4779000	4783000	You take out two of the lemures in a single stroke.
4783000	4789000	It sounds kind of like that.
4789000	4791000	The rest of them kind of shiver and anguish
4791000	4794000	and kind of shrink down fear.
4794000	4795000	Fuck it.
4795000	4797000	Intimidation.
4797000	4798000	They're still tied up.
4798000	4799000	All right.
4799000	4800000	All right, well...
4800000	4801000	I think we've dealt with them.
4801000	4803000	Well, no, my dad's on the pit on the other side of it.
4803000	4804000	Oh, all right.
4804000	4805000	All right.
4805000	4811000	I just, I mean, I...
4811000	4816000	I don't want to waste shocking grasp on these little slugs.
4816000	4817000	You can pass to me.
4817000	4819000	I still got a taste for blood.
4819000	4821000	I can go back in there with my sword and start chopping.
4821000	4822000	All right, go for it.
4822000	4825000	I'll cast Melph's Acid Arrow on...
4825000	4828000	Melph's Acid Arrow?
4828000	4829000	A milf?
4829000	4830000	No, not a milf.
4830000	4834000	Yes, it finds the nearest...
4834000	4837000	Never mind.
4837000	4839000	Melph's Acid Arrow.
4839000	4841000	2d4 damage for... yeah.
4841000	4842000	Melph.
4842000	4844000	Yeah, that happens.
4844000	4845000	I just...
4845000	4846000	I shoot it at one that he's not going to...
4846000	4847000	This is a...
4847000	4853000	A melph is a mom elf select-a-fuck.
4853000	4854000	It takes...
4854000	4855000	It takes 12...
4855000	4856000	No, not 12.
4856000	4857000	9 damage.
4857000	4859000	I can't math today.
4859000	4860000	This is the worst.
4860000	4861000	I'm loving this.
4861000	4863000	I'm bipolar.
4863000	4865000	Okay.
4865000	4866000	I don't know.
4866000	4869000	Our static objective is to just wipe up these things.
4869000	4871000	Like, we don't want to deal with them anymore.
4871000	4874000	They're dead.
4874000	4877000	Am I metagaming?
4877000	4880000	That's another thing entirely.
4880000	4883000	Okay, well, you killed two...
4883000	4885000	I'll just say they're all dead.
4885000	4886000	They're in the net.
4886000	4887000	You can cut them up.
4887000	4888000	That's metagaming.
4888000	4890000	Or just laziness.
4890000	4891000	It's just laziness.
4891000	4894000	You can't just call anything buzzwords.
4894000	4898000	They're related.
4898000	4902000	Humblebrag.
4902000	4903000	All right.
4903000	4906000	All the demons are slain.
4906000	4907000	All right.
4907000	4909000	I look into the pit.
4909000	4912000	After making a big show of the thorns receding,
4912000	4914000	my amulet of spring,
4914000	4918000	thorns replace yourselves upon my armulite.
4918000	4919000	Armulite?
4919000	4922000	Armulite?
4922000	4927000	That happens, and it's cinematic and visually stunning.
4927000	4928000	All right?
4928000	4929000	Yeah.
4929000	4930000	So you edge your way over to the pit,
4930000	4933000	and peering inside, it goes down about 20 feet.
4933000	4939000	And in the very middle, you see your father's head.
4939000	4942000	Dad?
4942000	4946000	Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
4946000	4948000	Is that just your head, or are you buried like in a...
4948000	4950000	I'm buried like in a...
4950000	4959000	I cast Featherfall and drop down to him.
4959000	4960000	All right.
4960000	4962000	You drop down to him without taking any harm.
4962000	4964000	But I make a big show also.
4964000	4968000	I raise my arms out like I'm sting in a music video.
4968000	4969000	Dropping down.
4969000	4972000	I just want him to understand that magic's important.
4972000	4976000	Gracefully drifting like sting down the pit.
4977000	4979000	Your father is thoroughly impressed,
4979000	4984000	and also buried up to his neck.
4984000	4985000	Dad, what are you doing?
4985000	4992000	I've been buried down here by demons.
4992000	4994000	Uh, all right, let me...
4994000	4996000	Look up for traps down there, Charpy.
4996000	4998000	Eh, whatever.
4998000	5001000	Gert, go get a shovel.
5001000	5005000	He does.
5005000	5008000	Yurch, like a bottle of water.
5008000	5009000	You say merch?
5009000	5010000	Yurch.
5010000	5011000	Oh, Yurch.
5011000	5015000	I thought it was like the guy that handled t-shirts or something.
5015000	5020000	That's me.
5020000	5023000	I go out and look for shovels with Yurch.
5023000	5027000	Okay, you guys find like the motherlode of shovels.
5027000	5031000	I come back with like too many shovels.
5031000	5035000	Dad, can you go into some detail about what happened?
5035000	5040000	Oh, oh can I?
5040000	5044000	When you left, if you recall,
5044000	5046000	you threw Quark onto a robot,
5046000	5049000	and you ended up needing to rescue him from an airship.
5049000	5050000	Yeah.
5050000	5052000	Yeah, yeah, after that happened, those airships,
5052000	5055000	they went north, but then a day later,
5055000	5058000	the Dark Armada returned in full force.
5058000	5060000	Laying waste to our countryside,
5060000	5062000	they deployed multiple cantroids,
5062000	5065000	as well as sending down demons, lemures, and devils,
5065000	5067000	and they ravaged towns and villages,
5067000	5069000	murdering and enslaving anyone.
5069000	5071000	They set siege to the western dwarves,
5071000	5073000	ripping apart the very mountains
5073000	5075000	to retrieve the three shards of power
5075000	5077000	the dwarves had been stockpiling.
5077000	5079000	They've been enslaving the strongest of us,
5079000	5081000	forcing us to work on their horror engines,
5081000	5084000	which have been serving some nefarious evil for weeks.
5084000	5087000	Since then, great rifts have been opening up in the sky,
5087000	5090000	allowing the free travel of dark stars, black airships,
5090000	5092000	and airborne demons and devils alike.
5092000	5095000	You must stop, Admiral Darkstar, son,
5095000	5097000	for all of our sakes.
5097000	5100000	Well, it must have been hard for you to say that.
5100000	5103000	Also, get me out. I'm buried.
5103000	5105000	Yeah, well, we're going to take care of that.
5105000	5108000	Yeah, I see six or seven shovels.
5108000	5110000	I take two of the shovels,
5110000	5113000	and either-handedly, like a weird barbarian spider,
5113000	5116000	I just start digging the spider out.
5116000	5119000	You find that an extremely ineffective way to burrow,
5119000	5122000	but at the same time, you do end up freeing him,
5122000	5124000	and he kind of stretches his limbs.
5124000	5126000	He's like, yeah, I guess they found me
5126000	5129000	too tough to imprison, so they just buried me.
5129000	5131000	Interesting spin.
5131000	5133000	Don't we have some of the shards they're looking for?
5133000	5136000	You guys have three shards,
5136000	5140000	and I believe Mango had ingested one of them.
5140000	5141000	Have you pooped yet, Dad?
5141000	5143000	Oh, yeah, yeah.
5143000	5145000	Did it hurt?
5145000	5148000	I mean, let's be honest.
5148000	5151000	No more than usual.
5151000	5155000	Did it seem extra magical when you pooped?
5155000	5158000	I detect magic on his poop.
5158000	5161000	There's no ready supply of poop at the moment.
5161000	5163000	Where did you poop, Dad?
5163000	5167000	Well, I mean, to be honest, just there,
5167000	5170000	like in the pit, in my pants.
5170000	5171000	Where's the poop?
5171000	5172000	Can I look at the poops?
5172000	5174000	It's all around the sun.
5175000	5178000	I look around for a shard in the poop.
5182000	5184000	He just rolled dice.
5186000	5188000	You don't find anything.
5188000	5190000	He kind of watches you looking around and he's like,
5190000	5192000	yeah, yeah, no, I definitely passed it,
5192000	5196000	but I mean, I gave it to my people for safekeeping.
5196000	5198000	Okay, is there a sink around I can go wash up?
5198000	5202000	No, this is more of a barbarian camp.
5202000	5204000	Who's the guy you gave it to?
5204000	5206000	Oh, Johnson.
5209000	5211000	Johnson, get over here.
5211000	5212000	Johnson?
5212000	5216000	A barbarian lopes up and clutches a pouch of fine leather.
5216000	5221000	He relinquishes the pouch to mango before taking his exit.
5224000	5228000	Johnson, is that the shard that my dad sharded?
5228000	5229000	Yeah.
5233000	5235000	What about the dwarven shards?
5235000	5237000	Have they been recovered by Admiral Darkstar?
5237000	5239000	We presume Darkstar has them.
5239000	5242000	To be honest, we're not on good terms with these dwarves,
5242000	5244000	so we don't know.
5244000	5247000	Yeah, well, about that, Dad, don't you think it's possible
5247000	5252000	that we got bigger fish to fry than our petty local conflicts?
5252000	5254000	It's a pretty good porn.
5254000	5256000	It's a pretty good porn?
5257000	5259000	Look, we're both drunk, Dad.
5259000	5261000	I've been buried.
5263000	5268000	I go into a mild barbarian rage and insist that they hug.
5269000	5271000	HUG!
5273000	5275000	I use diplomacy.
5275000	5278000	Which, both of those things?
5278000	5280000	They're mutually exclusive.
5280000	5281000	Okay, I use intimidate.
5281000	5284000	I intimidate them into hugging each other.
5286000	5290000	I have a 10 bonus skill modifier on intimidation.
5291000	5293000	Well, yeah.
5293000	5296000	So, phrase your intimidation for me.
5296000	5300000	I want you two assholes to hug so we can get back to business.
5301000	5304000	Calm down, guy. We're hugging, we're hugging.
5304000	5305000	Oh, they are hugging.
5305000	5307000	Yeah, he hugs Sharpie.
5307000	5311000	I cry while hugging, but not because the hug is emotional,
5311000	5313000	because I'm being forced to hug.
5315000	5317000	I'm hugging, it's like I've seen a eunuch.
5317000	5319000	It doesn't feel right.
5319000	5321000	That happens.
5321000	5323000	Okay, well...
5323000	5326000	Jeez, Dad, where do you think Admiral Darkstar went?
5326000	5328000	Holy cow, Dad.
5328000	5330000	I'm Michael J. Fox now.
5332000	5333000	Who is that you speak of?
5333000	5336000	Holy cow, Dad. Where do you think they went?
5336000	5338000	That's Medigame.
5338000	5340000	That's Medigame.
5340000	5341000	Oh, okay.
5341000	5343000	Because he wouldn't know, right? You get it?
5343000	5345000	He wouldn't know who that is.
5346000	5348000	No, no, there's no problem. I'm just pointing it out.
5348000	5351000	Yeah, but I'm not doing something. I didn't get on a hoverboard.
5351000	5352000	I didn't do anything.
5352000	5354000	I said, I just said...
5354000	5358000	What is a hoverboard? Let's find one and go to Admiral Darkstar.
5359000	5363000	To be clear, I want Medigaming to happen on stage.
5368000	5369000	What is a stage?
5370000	5372000	Yeah, what are you talking about?
5372000	5378000	I get experience points for not knowing who Michael J. Fox is, right?
5380000	5381000	Sure.
5381000	5382000	All right, perfect.
5382000	5383000	That's all I care about.
5383000	5384000	Yeah, yeah, okay, so where do we go?
5384000	5387000	The way you phrased it at one point is you use the example of,
5387000	5389000	if you go up to a bridge and I say,
5389000	5391000	Oh, there's a bridge across the river,
5391000	5392000	and if one of you says,
5392000	5395000	Oh, if you walk to the middle of it, it might be a trap.
5395000	5396000	That's Medigaming.
5396000	5398000	I mean, come on.
5398000	5401000	That was in the terrible explanation portion of that.
5401000	5406000	I take the six shovels and kind of put them together to form like a crude ladder
5406000	5407000	so we can all climb out,
5407000	5409000	and I climb up to the top of the pit and I go,
5409000	5411000	Let's stop fucking about and get on with this.
5412000	5413000	All right.
5413000	5414000	I got some Darkstar.
5414000	5416000	You can't turn the shovels into ladders, dude.
5416000	5419000	Well, you can kind of stack them up and kind of like angle them together.
5420000	5423000	Like he pushes them into the side of the bridge.
5423000	5425000	Oh, yeah, like that might work.
5425000	5426000	Like timber sports.
5426000	5427000	Okay.
5427000	5430000	And that exists because it's as old as timber.
5432000	5435000	Yeah. Yeah.
5435000	5436000	Okay.
5436000	5438000	So you, you, you, you jam the shovels in the wall.
5438000	5439000	That's what I meant.
5439000	5440000	I'm about it there.
5440000	5441000	That's cool.
5441000	5442000	That tracks.
5443000	5444000	All right.
5444000	5445000	All right.
5446000	5448000	Mango, what do we point us in the right direction?
5448000	5449000	Do we need an army?
5449000	5450000	What do we do?
5450000	5451000	Do we do?
5451000	5454000	Do we just run off and go, go in search of Admiral Darkstar?
5454000	5458000	Well, yeah, you might need an army, but, uh,
5458000	5460000	around here, we kind of got to mop up the demons.
5460000	5463000	So I'm afraid I can't really spare too many barbarians.
5464000	5466000	Uh, you could take Yurch.
5470000	5472000	Yurch is pretty good about finding shovels.
5475000	5478000	I hope he's not demoralized by my dad's clearly dubious endorsement.
5481000	5485000	It was Yurch with an earshot when my dad did that weird, like sideways glance
5485000	5486000	as he offered up Yurch.
5486000	5487000	Nah.
5487000	5488000	All right.
5488000	5491000	You can have my corkscrew.
5493000	5498000	Okay, we'll take Yurch, but dad, would it offend you if I took some dwarves?
5499000	5505000	I mean, yes, it would, but this is the fate of the universe we're talking about.
5505000	5506000	Yeah, dad.
5506000	5509000	Wait, no, just the material plane, probably.
5509000	5510000	But still.
5510000	5513000	But still, a total metaphor for your racism.
5513000	5514000	Yeah.
5514000	5515000	Yeah.
5515000	5516000	Yeah.
5516000	5517000	No racism.
5517000	5519000	Not a metaphor for your racism.
5519000	5521000	A metaphor for racism.
5521000	5524000	Far be it from me to tell you how to save the planet.
5524000	5528000	But, uh, I should at least tell you, you know that.
5528000	5530000	I'll tell you how to save the planet, dad.
5530000	5533000	Races working together.
5533000	5534000	Booyah.
5536000	5538000	Your words have touched him.
5539000	5540000	He feels touched.
5540000	5549000	I cast, I cast, I cast, uh, uh, uh, Einberg's, uh, lengthening arm and pat myself on the back.
5551000	5552000	Okay, that happens.
5552000	5553000	Sure.
5554000	5557000	But yeah, he's like that, that cloak you've been wearing.
5557000	5560000	I gave you that cloak to help you save your friend.
5560000	5563000	Yeah, it kind of ran out of charge, like immediately.
5563000	5564000	Yeah.
5564000	5570000	It works once per day, but you know, every time a new day happens, you can actually use it.
5571000	5574000	Well, I also have a falcon that I never use.
5574000	5580000	Yeah, I'm just, you know, I mean that falcon, he can fly and, you know, I'm told he shares spells with his caster.
5580000	5581000	Ooh.
5582000	5583000	I'm just reading the rules right now.
5583000	5585000	What do you mean he shares spells?
5585000	5587000	He can cast your spells for you.
5587000	5588000	What? Really?
5588000	5591000	I can send him up in the air and have him cast Fireball down on people?
5591000	5596000	Not quite yet, but when you get strong enough, he can channel certain spells.
5596000	5598000	Dad, why isn't your magic expert all of a sudden?
5598000	5604000	I just, you know, I just thought it'd be a good, appropriate time to, you know, fill you guys with some important knowledge.
5604000	5605000	Some meta knowledge?
5605000	5606000	Yeah.
5607000	5610000	Can you explain to me what my talking dagger is good for?
5610000	5615000	Uh, if I'm not mistaken, that talking dagger shattered and turned into like a force of nature.
5615000	5616000	Yeah.
5616000	5617000	Oh, oh, that's not-
5617000	5618000	But I've been buried lately, so.
5619000	5622000	Your intel's pretty good for a burying guy.
5622000	5623000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5623000	5624000	All right.
5625000	5628000	My enslaved barbarians, they have their ears to the ground.
5630000	5638000	Father, I shall defeat Admiral Darkstar, but I shall do it under the banner of all races and all beings of the material plane,
5638000	5643000	for Admiral Darkstar represents not just an external threat to those beings,
5643000	5651000	but the internal threat that is all the people not knowing that they should hang out together.
5651000	5657000	I was really convinced up till the end there, but I'm still with you.
5657000	5661000	I'm just saying, I'm your son, and I want to make you proud of me.
5661000	5669000	And I'm going to do it by being like kind of the Martin Luther King Jr. of medieval fantasy.
5669000	5672000	Who is this Martin Luther King Jr. you speak to?
5673000	5676000	Is he a foe with this Michael Fox you talk to?
5677000	5678000	Hoverboards!
5678000	5682000	Martin Luther King Jr. was the Michael J. Fox of civil rights.
5685000	5686000	I don't know how else to explain it.
5686000	5692000	While they're talking, I go into an office nearby and patent my new shovel ladder technology.
5692000	5696000	I do some diagrams, just to make sure that this seems like a pretty good invention.
5697000	5705000	You just sell a bag of six ladders as quirks, portable magic ladder.
5705000	5707000	Yeah, first shovel steps.
5709000	5712000	But dad, I got to know where you think Admiral Darkstar went.
5712000	5717000	Admiral Darkstar lurks in his black keep far to the north.
5718000	5719000	The north far.
5719000	5722000	Heavy horses, Mango?
5722000	5724000	Have me know.
5725000	5726000	Have you known?
5726000	5728000	Have me known.
5728000	5730000	Have you known what?
5731000	5732000	You've known horses?
5732000	5734000	Me have known horses.
5735000	5736000	You have known horses?
5736000	5739000	Well, do you know anybody that still has horses that I can get some horses?
5739000	5740000	No.
5741000	5742000	Known.
5743000	5744000	Dad?
5746000	5748000	You're embarrassing me, one of my friends.
5750000	5752000	I'm sorry about the horses, gentlemen.
5753000	5758000	With my barbarian impatience, I just start marching off towards the north.
5758000	5760000	And I say, come with me, quirk.
5761000	5762000	You're rich.
5762000	5763000	Come on.
5763000	5765000	It's not You're rich.
5765000	5766000	He's not.
5766000	5767000	What is it?
5767000	5768000	You're rich.
5769000	5770000	He's Robert You're rich.
5771000	5772000	You're rich.
5772000	5773000	Let's go.
5773000	5774000	I'm coming.
5774000	5776000	Let me get my rucksack.
5777000	5778000	He does.
5779000	5782000	Where do the dwarves lie?
5783000	5788000	Those filthy dwarves lie to the east in their broken mountains.
5791000	5794000	Should we go wrangle up dwarves before we go to the north?
5794000	5795000	Yeah, fuck that.
5795000	5796000	Let's just fucking go, baby.
5796000	5797000	Yeah, damn.
5797000	5798000	Who does it deal with?
5798000	5800000	He who travels fast just goes alone.
5800000	5803000	Except now we're going to go together, so we'll go at half speed.
5804000	5805000	All right.
5805000	5807000	We head north into the sun.
5807000	5808000	Nothing.
5809000	5810000	Into the noon.
5813000	5814000	Into the...
5814000	5815000	I don't get it.
5815000	5818000	Well, if you were heading east or west, it would be into the sunrise or sunset.
5818000	5819000	Oh, the sun.
5819000	5820000	Nothing.
5824000	5826000	Nice, nice, nice metal laugh.
5827000	5829000	I thought it was funny after I got it.
5830000	5833000	But sincerity wasn't going to help at that point.
5834000	5838000	How far is the journey to the Darkstar encampment?
5839000	5841000	It'll be several days.
5842000	5844000	Perhaps even several weeks.
5844000	5848000	We should probably stop at some town and actually get horses at some point.
5849000	5851000	Is there a town between...
5851000	5853000	Here, if we head north, will we come to a town?
5853000	5855000	You guys hail from Thornvale, right?
5856000	5857000	Yeah.
5858000	5861000	Thornvale's a little bit out of the way, but you might go there.
5861000	5864000	I mean, otherwise, if you go north, it's pretty far north,
5864000	5868000	but there's a place called Fornheim, the frozen city.
5869000	5871000	Ah, gateway to Thornvale.
5872000	5873000	Not really.
5873000	5874000	It's more directly north.
5874000	5876000	It's more like the gateway to...
5876000	5881000	For the people of the extreme north, Thornburg is the gateway to Thornvale.
5882000	5883000	Fornheim?
5884000	5885000	Fornheim.
5885000	5886000	Fornheim.
5886000	5888000	The Lovers, I think, is the slogan.
5889000	5891000	The slogan is, it's the frozen city.
5897000	5899000	Where our buildings are frozen.
5899000	5901000	Well, I have the armament of winter. I should fit right in there.
5901000	5902000	Yeah.
5902000	5903000	No, it'll be great when we get there.
5903000	5905000	To Fornheim!
5905000	5907000	All right, well, we head for Fornheim.
5907000	5909000	You head for Fornheim.
5910000	5911000	Time passes.
5911000	5912000	Time passes.
5914000	5915000	Time passes.
5915000	5916000	Holy shit, Fornheim!
5917000	5918000	Hey, don't get ahead of yourself.
5918000	5919000	Sorry.
5919000	5921000	There's possible random encounters that might happen.
5923000	5925000	Before those random encounters happen, we should stop.
5926000	5927000	Oh, yeah, definitely.
5927000	5928000	We should have one random encounter.
5928000	5929000	Whatever you want.
5929000	5930000	Just have one quick random encounter.
5930000	5931000	But it's just going to be like some thing.
5931000	5933000	Oh, there's wrestling in the bushes.
5933000	5934000	Then there's spiders.
5934000	5936000	You can go eat chocolates.
5939000	5940000	I know that's table talk.
5940000	5941000	That's fine.
5941000	5942000	Okay.
5943000	5944000	There's no table.
5944000	5947000	I'm table talking with my friend about whether or not we should stop here.
5947000	5948000	All right.
5948000	5949000	You want to stop?
5949000	5950000	Well, I'm just saying, like...
5950000	5951000	I love to stop.
5953000	5954000	He hates it.
5954000	5955000	He hates it.
5956000	5957000	It's the worst.
5958000	5960000	I didn't expect to have such a long session.
5960000	5963000	I mean, I have a little bit planned, but, you know.
5963000	5964000	Okay.
5964000	5966000	Oh, so you just ran out of ideas.
5966000	5967000	It's not ran out.
5967000	5972000	I'm running out, and it'll take about a week to get, you know, all of the ideas.
5972000	5973000	I got it.
5973000	5974000	Okay.
5974000	5975000	So we'll stop here.
5975000	5976000	Especially everybody.
5982000	5984000	Jeff, what have we learned?
5985000	5986000	I've learned a lot tonight.
5986000	5989000	Yeah, I thought you guys were going to go to the dwarves, so...
5989000	5991000	Oh, we go to the dwarves.
5991000	5992000	No, no.
5992000	5993000	We go to the dwarves.
5993000	5994000	Okay.
5994000	5995000	You find the dwarves.
5995000	5996000	They say no.
5998000	6000000	That's not what I had planned.
6000000	6003000	They hang on their big dwarven door, and I go, let me in!
6003000	6004000	They don't.
6008000	6009000	All right.
6009000	6010000	All right.
6010000	6011000	We head back north.
6011000	6012000	We head back to Forrenheim.
6012000	6013000	Forsheim?
6013000	6014000	What's it called?
6014000	6015000	Forrendale?
6015000	6019000	Forren... F-O-R-N-H-E-I-M?
6019000	6020000	Forrenheim.
6020000	6022000	Sounds like all they make is shoes.
6022000	6024000	That's their main export.
6024000	6025000	Frozen shoes?
6026000	6028000	That's their other slogan.
6029000	6030000	We make frozen shoes.
6030000	6032000	It's for lovers of frozen shoes.
6032000	6033000	All right.
6033000	6035000	How do we end the show these days?
6037000	6041000	We've been ending it the last couple of weeks on some kind of big event in Dungeons & Dragons.
6041000	6044000	Can we camp for the night?
6044000	6046000	You camp for the night.
6046000	6047000	Okay.
6047000	6048000	All right.
6048000	6052000	And I climb a tree.
6054000	6056000	Yeah, you climb a tree.
6056000	6059000	You go up into the top of the highest tree.
6059000	6064000	You can see all the plains and rolling hills stretching out before you.
6064000	6067000	I take a bunch of shovels and make a tree ladder.
6068000	6069000	I go up...
6069000	6076000	Even though there's branches that he already climbed, I'm just kind of troubleshooting my new invention.
6077000	6081000	You find it doesn't work nearly as well in trees as it does in...
6081000	6084000	I use branches where I need be, and I get up there with Sharpie,
6084000	6087000	and we are at the canopy of the tree, and we're looking around us.
6087000	6094000	And the camera orbits us, and it orbits from the front of us where I put my arm around my little friend Cork.
6094000	6105000	It orbits around us to where the sun is setting above the edge of a majestic landscape of wonder and mystery...
6105000	6106000	And beauty.
6106000	6108000	...and other synonyms for unknown things.
6109000	6115000	And we kind of take in the majesty, and the music swells.
6115000	6117000	As I say, Cork?
6119000	6120000	Yeah.
6122000	6127000	You may be little, but you got a big...
6129000	6130000	Dig?
6132000	6133000	That's Hermiton, everybody.
6133000	6134000	Thank you for coming.
6135000	6137000	We're fucking...
6138000	6141000	We're fucking at the top of a tree.
6142000	6149000	It's only Sharpie and me, and nobody knows but we.
6150000	6152000	Thank you very much for coming to Hermiton again.
6152000	6153000	We would love it to worship you well.
6153000	6155000	One more time for Seek Donnelly.
6155000	6164000	Remember, everybody, give more than you take.
6164000	6165000	Thank you, everybody, here at Meltdown.
6165000	6166000	Thank you, Spencer Crittenden.
6166000	6169000	One more time for me, Jeff Davis, and Dan Harmon, your mayor.
6175000	6177000	I think you tell her for our lovely glasses.
6177000	6178000	She's fantastic.
6179000	6180000	Yeah, give more than you take.
6180000	6181000	Give more than you take.
6185000	6186000	Thank you.
