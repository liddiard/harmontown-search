0	6640	When we set out to make this, we really, we came up with a filter that is, we like to
6640	9480	call right brain comedy.
9480	13600	The combination of funny and audacious and authentic.
13600	16960	And then we came up with a list of people that we really wanted to work with.
16960	22300	And at the very tippy top of that list was Dan Harmon.
22300	26800	Everything that he's done with regard, they're loading on the stage, I'm literally vamping
26800	30320	so that they can load Dan's vodka on stage.
30320	38000	So we really wanted to work with him and he pitched a show which is the marriage of Dinner
38000	41640	for Five, Rick and Morty, and Game of Thrones.
41640	46200	And it's a brilliant idea, it's really strange, but I'm not going to talk about it, I'm going
46200	50960	to actually bring up the creator himself, a TV, literally a TV legend.
50960	54320	I'm really happy he's here, I'm grateful he's here, Mr. Dan Harmon.
54320	69880	Dan Harmon, no don't step on that.
69880	74320	The first thing they told me is don't walk on that.
74320	75320	Just to trap you.
75320	76320	What in the fuck?
76320	77320	What?
77320	81200	They literally, I should have probably told you that beforehand.
81200	87240	That's not, there's signs everywhere for everything, that's the one place there should
87240	88240	be one.
88240	91560	We had a long conversation, they said whatever you do, don't let Dan walk on that.
91560	96080	I have failed horribly at everything, I've almost killed him.
96080	97080	Everyone knew but me.
97080	98080	How am I?
98080	103240	Another thing that, well here's the thing that everyone knows but you, you can get Werner
103240	108720	Herzog, the real one, for like a thousand bucks, I've done it.
108720	111200	We decided to go with a fake Werner Herzog.
111200	117080	That's not on record, that's just some guy.
117080	118080	He's a thousand bucks.
118080	119080	Werner?
119080	120080	The real one.
120080	121160	We should have just called him then.
121160	123920	He always wants the money, his documentaries are not.
123920	125240	Don't make money, everyone knows.
125240	128960	I used to make documentaries, that's why I'm making comedy now.
128960	134160	Thank you so much, it's great to be here, thank you.
134160	138520	So can you talk a little bit about what Harmon Quest will be?
139120	144160	It's something that I've been conceiving ever since the day that we were doing Harm in Town,
144160	146920	my podcast, which was never a career choice.
146920	151240	In fact it's been detrimental to my career in every way because it's the show at which
151240	156880	I played the Chevy Chase voicemail and got fired, but I subsequently made it into a podcast
156880	160480	because I was like, well if this is not going to be intimate then let's just broadcast it
160480	168240	and at that show at one point I thought I've been fascinated with a certain fantasy role
168240	176160	playing game that has no name, let alone any initials or anything that anyone would recognize.
176160	180600	My entire life I've written a lot of sketches about it, it's my introduction to everything
180600	182840	before improv, before anything.
182840	189800	It was like the ultimate like, gait into storytelling.
189800	195480	Yeah, and just safety for nerds and this whole culture that we've entered.
195480	202520	And so in the podcast I said at one point at the time I thought the joke will be how
202520	206600	not entertaining it is to play this game.
206600	211640	And so I actually thought in my head, I bet in my audience if I ask for seven Dungeon
211640	214960	Masters, seven will raise their hand.
214960	219200	And nobody raised their hand except for one guy who came up on stage and his name was
219200	225960	Spencer who we'll meet later and he'll later say he was living in the Seamy Valley area
225960	230840	and he came that night through some weird pot induced hallucination that he was like
230840	235880	I bet I should go, I think I should play D&D with Dan Harmon.
235880	242080	It's all very trippy and weird, but he became a fixture and we've been playing the game
242080	248360	ever since and since then I was like, my fascination with the funniest thing I've ever seen on
248360	251980	TV which was the Ricky Gervais HBO show.
251980	257440	Because I love the relationship between the real audio of like Carl Pilkington trying
257440	263360	to explain himself and this team of animators that are like so gifted that they're like,
263360	270680	oh no, this guy is struggling and being mocked, but like I went to art school, I can show
270680	277240	you what he means when he's talking about his theory about birds or worms or something.
277240	279720	They actually make his point better than he ever did.
279720	280720	Yes, absolutely.
280720	286840	And everyone's point is made when they're supported by beautiful animation or any medium.
286840	290640	Yeah, it's truly like anyone can be a hero and all that stuff.
290640	295720	And in fantasy role playing, that's what you're drawn to is the idea that you could be a hero
295720	300760	and yet the irony often is that you can take 10 minutes to open a door because you argue
300760	301760	...
301760	303280	I'm going to try my sword, I'm going to try this.
303280	307880	And I think it's funny and so the idea from the get-go was, or from the see-so.
307880	308880	Nice.
308880	309880	That's nice.
309880	310880	You should have called it get-go.
310880	311880	Can we do that?
311880	318120	It'll remind people of auto insurance, they'll love it.
318120	319120	By the way, Shapiro?
319120	320120	Yeah.
320120	321120	Are you an Avenger?
321120	322120	Or just a self-loathing Jew?
322120	323120	I am.
323120	324120	Like what?
324120	325120	Oh, no.
325120	326120	It's Shapiro.
326120	329400	This is one of many times I've been called a self-loathing Jew.
329400	330400	Why?
330400	331400	Seriously?
331400	332400	Yeah.
332840	334000	It's a Philadelphia thing.
334000	338400	If you're from the Delaware Valley or down there, everyone thinks you're like a high
338400	341600	flu, Levine, Levine, Stein.
341600	345680	It's really actually typical South Jersey white trash bullshit.
345680	346680	Okay.
346680	347680	Now I get it.
347680	348680	609.
348680	349680	Anyone?
349680	350680	Not 69, 609.
350680	353320	It's an area code and stuff.
353320	362320	My grandparents on my mom's side, last name, now pronounced reek, used to be right.
362320	363320	Wow.
363320	364320	You can see why they've changed that.
364320	365320	Uh-huh.
365320	366320	Yes, I can, Mr. Shapiro.
366320	367320	Yes, well played.
367320	368320	Let's all live in a masquerade.
368320	369320	I'm supporting my father's family.
369320	370320	As we all are.
370320	371320	Anyways.
371320	372320	Where was I?
372320	373320	Yeah.
373320	374320	We're launching a show.
374320	375320	It's called CSO.
375320	376320	It's $4 a month.
376320	377320	Bye.
377320	378320	Oh, shit.
378320	379320	Don't walk on the thing.
379320	380320	It's a trap.
380320	390320	There's nothing but dead Bengal tigers down there.
391320	392320	Where'd he go?
392320	393320	Name Cecil.
393320	394320	Or Seisel.
394320	399320	Okay, so it's...
399320	400320	So that's it.
400320	401320	I don't know.
401320	405960	I pitched it to Amy Carlson at UCP, Universal Cable Productions, our production partner
405960	406960	on this.
406960	408320	And then we met on a teleconference.
408320	410320	Yeah, because you came in self-sufficient.
410320	411320	I had to sell you.
411320	412320	I had to sell you.
412320	413320	I had to sell you.
413320	414320	All right.
414320	415320	On doing it with us.
415320	419760	And one of the things that was on the interwebs this weekend is why you decided...
419760	421760	Why this place, of all places, to do it?
421760	427200	And I don't know the answer to that question, so I ask it very risk-takingly.
427200	431200	Because the budget was higher.
431200	432200	Because no one would ever...
432200	433200	It wouldn't be on regular TV.
433200	436920	Like, it could have been a web thing, but it would have to be all animation.
436920	440400	You said Dinner for Five, which you had a hand in creating, right?
440400	442400	Yeah, you did.
442400	444000	So the show will be...
444000	446160	The animation isn't done, but we've shot the stuff.
446160	451000	So what it is, it's like sort of Dinner for Five quality Nathan Filion sitting at a table
451000	457040	with Spencer and myself and Jeff Davis and my now ex-wife, Erin McGathey.
457040	458040	God damn it.
458040	459040	Distracting.
459040	460040	Distracting.
460040	461040	You did that.
461040	462040	No, it was the show.
462040	463040	The show broke us up.
463040	467200	You will hear from my lawyer, David Fleishmane.
467200	473480	Isn't it like, do we cheat him and how?
473480	476000	Do we chite him and who?
476840	477840	It's all about the vowels.
477840	481200	So it's Nathan and a bunch of other really cool people coming in.
481200	483760	Yes, celebrity guests, most of whom have shows on CISO.
483760	487080	And then you roll the die and you go into the fantasy role-playing and then it animates.
487080	488080	It's animation.
488080	489080	It's like 80% animation.
489080	491320	You promised me it's beautiful animation.
491320	492320	It's going to be beautiful.
492320	494440	I hope so, because I'm paying enough.
494440	498000	So with that, thank you again for...
498000	500800	It's nice, you should do a spit-take there.
500800	503360	It's not beautiful.
503360	504480	Thank you for coming.
504480	506120	Thank you for bringing your crew.
506120	509800	And with that, I will cede the stage to you and your...
509800	511800	Oh, you mean leave it.
511800	513640	Or side the stage.
513640	517640	To you and your Harmon Quest, a Harmon Town crew.
517640	518640	All right, great.
518640	520160	The Steve Jobs is dead.
520160	521160	Long live Evan Shapiro.
521160	522160	A Shapiro.
522160	523160	God damn it.
523160	524160	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the SBA Theater.
524160	525160	Am I correct about that?
525160	526160	No?
526160	527160	What's it called?
527320	528320	SBA, what does that stand for?
528320	529320	Scary.
529320	540080	You and our theater here in somewhere in New York City, a very rare special.
540080	545320	Harmon Town is now in session.
545320	553160	Please welcome, emerging gently from his chrysalis like a magnificent butterfly.
554160	559160	The mayor of Harmon Town, the star of Harmon Quest, Mr. Dan Harmon.
565160	570160	The TV is the same as it used to be.
570160	572160	There's gonna be some changes.
572160	573160	Okay, all right.
573160	574160	We can get the lights back up now.
574160	575160	Everyone's a critic.
575160	576160	Literally.
576160	577160	Tonight, everyone's a critic.
577160	578160	I'm loud enough.
578160	579160	I don't feel loud.
579160	580160	Yeah, I mean...
580160	581160	You don't feel loud either.
582160	583160	The truth is, normally...
583160	585160	What if you're being in a small intimate space doing this?
585160	589260	We're used to more monitor too, but I will say when we were watching all the very funny
589260	591400	content, the level's very low.
591400	595160	It's like you should blast the people with the funny stuff.
595160	597160	Okay, someone's sarcastically turning it up now.
597160	598160	There it is.
598160	599160	There it is.
599160	600160	Okay.
600160	601160	Yeah, okay.
601160	602160	We got it.
602160	603660	That's where it should have been.
603660	604660	That cartoon was amazing.
604660	605660	The cyanide thing.
605660	606660	Very funny.
606660	607660	That's intimidatingly funny.
607660	610660	Has anyone pulled off a cartoon sketch show?
610660	611660	Robot Chicken.
611660	612660	All right.
612660	615600	Different, different, different, different venue.
615600	616600	That's why I do that.
616600	617600	A competitor.
617600	618600	All right.
618600	624060	We don't have anything to talk about, so let's keep it moving.
624060	625060	We have one thing to talk about.
625060	633040	When you walked across this inch and a half piece of plywood, it bowed like a fiddle.
633040	636040	Why would that be there?
636040	637040	That's insane.
637040	642900	I was almost certain that was the end of my career, because if without you, I'm nobody.
642900	647180	I would be honored to die that way, but angry.
647180	651860	But you said that beneath it is a pit full of dead bangle tigers.
651860	655020	You'd land gently on a bunch of soft bangle tigers down there.
655020	661300	Well, yeah, but even a dead bangle tiger, have you ever stepped on a dead bee?
661300	662940	That's the only bee I've ever been stung by.
662940	664780	I stepped on a dead bee on a beach.
664780	666580	We'll talk about it later.
666600	668040	How did you know it was dead when you stepped on it?
668040	669040	You saw a dead bee?
669040	673080	Well, because it didn't hurt as much as I had dreaded a bee sting would ever hurt.
673080	675520	So I was like, that must have just a dead bee.
675520	677760	And I went back and the bee was dead.
677760	678880	And I was like, I'm sorry.
678880	680400	And he was like, fuck you.
680400	684960	And I already died, and then you stepped on me, and I gave you what I could.
684960	687080	And I was like, it felt like a little piece of glass.
687080	690520	And he's like, noted, and he died.
690520	694240	I lived my life serving the insectoid hive mind.
694240	698860	By the way, the final joke is going to be on you, so did you.
698860	703100	And I was like, whoa, bee, don't.
703100	705540	Like, I'm a sentient primate.
705540	706900	I'm going to live for 70 years.
706900	710380	And he's like, just figure it out.
710380	714420	This is the first time we've done a harm in town since I went away for two and a half weeks.
714420	717300	And while I was away, divorce.
717300	719460	Yeah, but the bee was a big deal.
722140	723100	I'll never forget that.
723100	725720	I think you're using the bee to deflect from your real emotions right now.
725720	726760	No, no, no, no, no.
726760	727680	All right, let me look at my notes.
727680	729040	See, now you're using your phones.
729040	730240	Very classic Carmen.
730240	732520	Well, we only have so much time.
732520	738320	We have to give them a Reader's Digest version of our normally fast-paced show.
738320	740480	Let's bring up Spencer Crittenden, the game master.
740480	742160	Hell yeah.
742160	743480	Just so that he's here when we.
747480	749960	Oh, I want that music to be louder.
749960	750680	There we go.
750680	751520	We're getting there now.
753880	754880	Does this work?
754880	757380	Does it?
757380	760080	This is a mismatch here.
760080	760880	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
765880	768560	I'm going to fall down.
768560	769680	All right.
769680	771120	Well, at least we got the mic stand.
771120	775520	This is a school of visual arts.
775520	776720	That's fine.
776720	778400	It's the golden age of TV.
778400	780000	The money's gone, but the content is.
780000	781040	There's so many visual arts.
781040	782760	For the front row, it's perfect perspective.
782760	786020	It looks like you're sitting down on a table right there for the front row.
786020	787220	OK.
787220	788220	Is this going to work?
788220	789420	No, it's not going to work.
789420	790460	OK, well, all right.
790460	793060	Let's start with, we have to speed through my shit.
793060	795500	Let's do a segment called, do you have music cues?
795500	796020	Kind of.
796020	796700	I'm doing it off my phone.
796700	797300	All right, well, do you?
797300	798060	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
798060	798500	What do you want?
798500	801500	Let's do a segment called Divorce Advice Corner.
801500	802740	Divorce Advice Corner.
802740	804500	Hold up one second.
804500	805980	Divorce Advice Corner.
805980	806460	All right.
807160	809160	Yo.
809160	811160	Divorce Advice.
811160	816160	When you need it, it must be nice to give it, to see it, to receive it, to give it.
816160	817160	Yo.
817160	818160	You got a living.
818160	820160	Rapping while making a drink.
820160	821160	No.
821160	823160	I'm just a professional.
823160	824160	The multitasking rapper.
824160	825160	Yo.
825160	826160	Yo.
826160	828160	Multitasking rapper.
828160	831160	I got an ad called Slack for my team collaborations.
831160	833160	There's a channel for each collaboration.
833860	836860	I've talked about it all across the nation.
836860	837860	What happened?
837860	838860	Are we all going to die here tonight?
838860	839860	It doesn't really all die.
846860	848860	That was, yeah, yeah, you're good, man.
851860	853860	This is, this is a pretty good show so far.
853860	855860	I think this is a lot better than the last few.
855860	856360	No.
856360	856860	Yeah.
856860	857360	Wow.
857360	858860	It's not as good as the animated show.
858860	859860	It's like a Swiss watch.
859860	861860	But they had time to finish that, and we're just...
861860	862860	Yeah.
863860	864360	Yeah.
864360	864860	Okay.
864860	867860	Well, you thought my, you thought, no.
867860	872360	Divorce Advice Corner is about, please don't give me advice about my divorce.
874360	876360	Like most people, I was actually uplifted.
876360	879360	Like my wife and I, we got married.
879360	883360	We decided not to be married anymore.
883360	886360	So there's like two categories of people where you go like,
886360	888360	you let people know, and it's like weird.
888360	889360	It always feels shameful.
889360	892360	You feel like you spilled like just jelly.
892360	893860	Like, or something, anything.
893860	896360	Like, why do I, anything.
896360	898860	Nothing should be spilled, let alone like a lifetime together.
898860	901860	And 11 months after you threw a big party and said,
901860	906860	I love God and her father, and I swear to this one's for keeps.
909860	911860	And then you're like, nah, forget it.
911860	913360	It feels shameful.
913360	914360	It feels terrible.
914360	918360	It's like joining the Boy Scouts and getting like one yellow bead,
918360	921360	and then just being like, yeah, but I like computers.
921360	923360	Do Boy Scouts get beads?
923360	924360	What?
924360	925360	Beads?
925360	926360	Yeah, just don't get excited.
926360	927360	They're just regular beads.
927360	928360	Why?
928360	929360	No, you wear them.
929360	932360	You don't put them in your butt, Spencer.
932360	934360	This guy loves beads in his butt.
934360	936360	Well, all right.
936360	939360	I mean, sure, doesn't everybody, but I mean,
939360	942360	Boy Scouts do, I don't think they get beads.
942360	943360	Well, they did in the 80s.
943360	944360	Oh, okay, whatever.
944360	948360	Well, you think now they get like solar panels?
948360	951360	Like monster energy drinks or something.
951360	953360	They probably do get like a Pepsi.
953360	956360	Yeah, they probably get like a TV and a scholarship.
956360	958360	What am I talking about?
958360	961360	All right.
961360	963360	And just saying like, so most people you go,
963360	966360	like you broach the subject tenderly and you go,
966360	969360	yeah, I don't know when to tell you this, but yeah,
969360	975360	it's, and most people are like, it's kind of, you know,
975360	977360	it's nice because you're already in a shameful place
977360	981360	and most people they'll say, oh, I'm on my third, like,
981360	982360	like, did you have kids?
982360	983360	And you go, no.
983360	985360	And they go, whoo, dodged a bullet.
985360	987360	But they, or, or they'll just go like, yeah, it happens.
987360	988360	It happens.
988360	991360	And then there's that like 1% of people that are like, like,
991360	994360	well, did you try to make it work?
994360	996360	And most of those people, they, they know you the least.
996360	998360	And it's like, it's like just strangers.
998360	999360	They're like, don't.
999360	1001360	It's obviously you're talking about yourself.
1001360	1002360	Obviously.
1002360	1005360	Like, I, like, I, yeah.
1005360	1006360	Did you try?
1006360	1007360	No, I didn't.
1007360	1010360	I, I thought, you know, we just, we got married and then we
1010360	1014360	thought, you know what would be fun and pleasurable and
1014360	1019360	inexpensive and, and easy and, and, and the path of least
1019360	1023360	resistance and let's just do it without thinking about it.
1023360	1024360	Let's get divorced.
1024360	1026360	Like, we didn't think about it.
1026360	1027360	Thank you so much.
1027360	1028360	You asshole.
1028360	1030360	You terrible, terrible person.
1030360	1034360	Why, why is it that, that when married people hear that you're
1034360	1038360	getting a divorce, some of them, not all of you, but they,
1038360	1044360	they all feel like they're allowed to tell you that you
1044360	1046360	made the wrong decision.
1046360	1049360	But if divorced people tell married people the same thing,
1049360	1052360	even though the divorce rate is like 80%, so there's way more
1052360	1053360	of us.
1053360	1056360	But if you tell, if someone says, I decided to get married
1056360	1058360	and you say, nah, I don't know about that.
1058360	1060360	You're called a dick.
1060360	1063360	So what are the, what are the rules that are applying?
1063360	1064360	And it's always the same thing.
1064360	1066360	It's like, oh, marriage is hard.
1066360	1067360	Marriage takes work.
1067360	1070360	So you're, you're, it's, it's, it's combat rules.
1070360	1074360	It's like, if you're a veteran, you're allowed to talk about 9-11 more.
1074360	1078360	Like you're allowed to, like if you did, if you're, even if you're
1078360	1081360	a reservist, even in any capacity, if you've ever worn a
1081360	1084360	uniform, like you're more of a hero, which is true.
1084360	1088360	Like you've, you've volunteered yourself for like hard ass, like,
1088360	1090360	like life risking work.
1090360	1094360	Anybody that ever says like, I don't know if I should vote this
1094360	1098360	time, Duke, and then Duke from G.I. Joe is like, hey,
1098360	1100360	now, knowing it's half the battle.
1100360	1102360	And you're like, okay, fuck that shit.
1102360	1104360	I can't argue with you.
1104360	1106360	Just want to invite you next Christmas.
1106360	1111360	The, but it's like, so if the rules apply to, the same rules apply
1111360	1116360	to combat as to marriage, why are you married?
1116360	1119360	Because it's not a fight.
1119360	1125360	And you should just get divorced.
1125360	1127360	Just like combat rules.
1127360	1128360	Well, no.
1128360	1131360	In combat, if you're like, this is hard and you leave, that's
1131360	1135360	called losing a war, which can have global repercussions.
1135360	1138360	In marriage, if you're like, this is hard, we should leave.
1138360	1140360	That's a victory.
1140360	1143360	That's one of the two most beautiful things a couple can
1143360	1146360	do in addition to getting married.
1146360	1149360	Because it takes just as much bravery and just as much respect
1149360	1155360	for the other person and just as much like I cried just as much.
1155360	1157360	It's a beautiful thing and most of us do it.
1157360	1160360	We get married and then we get divorced.
1160360	1162360	Will you get married again, do you think?
1162360	1164360	Oh, yeah, yeah, like three more times.
1164360	1171360	No, my penis is a third nipple at this point and I'm happy now.
1171360	1172360	Some people like that.
1172360	1179360	Well, yeah, I mean, Evan Shapiro maybe, but it begs the question,
1179360	1182360	what is sex and what is just an overall deal?
1182360	1188360	I'm into gals, but I want to make out with Evan Shapiro's hair.
1188360	1190360	His hair is really good.
1190360	1191360	You like his hair?
1191360	1192360	Yeah, I noticed it.
1192360	1193360	Well, people are starting to mention it.
1193360	1195360	It's becoming famous hair.
1195360	1197360	I feel like it's by his design that it's becoming famous.
1197360	1198360	Yeah, of course.
1198360	1200360	No, I don't think there's a lot of work into it, but I think
1200360	1202360	he's got something special going on.
1202360	1204360	All right, next segment.
1204360	1209360	I'm saying he didn't have to go into creating TV special video
1209360	1211360	demand platform thingies.
1211360	1213360	He could have just been a hair model.
1213360	1215360	Yeah, no, yeah, he probably doesn't have to do anything.
1215360	1216360	I'm sure he was born right.
1216360	1218360	That means he must be really good at doing TV if he's...
1218360	1219360	Right?
1219360	1220360	What?
1220360	1221360	Go ahead.
1221360	1222360	Oh, thank you.
1222360	1225360	All right, so, okay, well, I'm racist.
1225360	1227360	I wanted to bring that up.
1228360	1229360	Whoo!
1230360	1232360	Yo, I'm racist.
1233360	1234360	Okay.
1236360	1237360	I really am.
1237360	1238360	It's official now because...
1238360	1240360	I've never doubted that for a minute.
1241360	1243360	Well, okay, I did, and now I'm like really...
1243360	1246360	Well, yeah, like you said earlier today, you obsess about race,
1246360	1248360	but what's the difference at some point?
1248360	1249360	Right.
1249360	1252360	You can cross a Rubicon of obsession about race.
1252360	1255360	And I crossed it today because I was like...
1256360	1258360	I was sitting at the hotel bar and there's pictures
1258360	1261360	in the wall of like famous people that either stayed
1261360	1263360	in the hotel or whatever, but it's like black and white
1263360	1265360	photos, and so it's like...
1265360	1267360	It all has like this sixties vibe, and there's a guy
1267360	1270360	laying in bed, and he's like looking at the camera,
1270360	1271360	like he's like...
1271360	1273360	I just distributed a wall of famous people,
1273360	1275360	and I'm from LA, and so I'm just like,
1275360	1278360	it's just pictures of famous people from the sixties
1278360	1280360	that stayed here, and I was like,
1280360	1282360	am I racist or is that Morgan Freeman?
1282360	1284360	And you're like, no, that's Jimi Hendrix.
1286360	1287360	And I'm racist.
1287360	1289360	I like that you think that Morgan Freeman stayed
1289360	1290360	at that hotel in the sixties.
1290360	1291360	I love it.
1291360	1293360	Well, in my mind, like also that Morgan Freeman...
1293360	1294360	He was a full grown adult.
1294360	1295360	He might have been.
1295360	1296360	Maybe he probably was.
1296360	1297360	I don't know.
1297360	1298360	How old was Morgan Freeman?
1300360	1301360	Old enough.
1301360	1302360	Old enough, yeah.
1302360	1304360	But that hotel wouldn't have been a boutique hotel
1304360	1305360	back then. It would have been a flop.
1305360	1306360	Yeah.
1306360	1309360	Speaking of racism, that hotel is like...
1309360	1311360	Also, the picture of all those paintings,
1311360	1313360	if I can draw it out for you, there was...
1314360	1316360	What he thought was Morgan Freeman surrounded by David Bowie,
1316360	1319360	Mick Jagger, Rick Sinatra, Chet Baker,
1319360	1322360	and a young Morgan Freeman laying in the back.
1323360	1325360	To be fair, a lot of those pictures I thought were
1325360	1330360	Julian Assange and like a friend of mine from high school.
1331360	1332360	I don't know.
1332360	1334360	I go by like hats and eyebrows.
1338360	1340360	But I'm happy to admit I'm racist.
1340360	1341360	I'm not happy. I'm sad.
1341360	1343360	But I also don't want to fight.
1343360	1345360	But you're not a bigot.
1345360	1348360	You don't believe that one race is better than the other
1348360	1349360	or some are worse than the other.
1349360	1352360	I don't even think that's a tenable form of racism anymore.
1352360	1354360	That's self-defeating racism.
1354360	1357360	A true racist would simply hang back and notice race.
1360360	1361360	And so I guess I'm one of them.
1361360	1363360	I didn't want to be. I don't want to be.
1364360	1367360	I wish I could rip this white skin off my skeleton
1367360	1369360	and throw it in the race garbage.
1371360	1374360	And God will ensure that that happens.
1374360	1376360	But in the meantime, I'm a holdover.
1376360	1379360	I'm a strange skeleton in your museum.
1379360	1381360	I'm like, race, noticer.
1383360	1384360	That's it.
1385360	1388360	I feel like your hang-up about race is also that you hang up about
1388360	1391360	men, women, me, you, the stranger, the friend.
1391360	1392360	It's all about other.
1392360	1396360	It's like you're not xenophobic is the word, maybe.
1396360	1401360	But it's like strangers, you have a reaction to it.
1401360	1403360	Anybody to the extent that they're different from you,
1403360	1404360	especially visually.
1405360	1407360	Look at the look he's giving me right now.
1407360	1408360	No, I am.
1409360	1412360	You have a reaction because you feel like it reflects on you in some way.
1412360	1415360	You take an Asian guy walking into the room personally,
1415360	1417360	not because you think that he's bad.
1418360	1420360	Well, they're usually there to kill me.
1421360	1424360	At my behest, I hired them to train me.
1427360	1430360	Pink Panther, thank you, Evan Shapiro, probably.
1430360	1432360	I'm assuming that was Evan.
1434360	1435360	He's a curator.
1436360	1439360	Everyone else is like, date line, TMZ.
1440360	1441360	He confirmed it.
1441360	1442360	He's racist.
1443360	1445360	This will get buried on page six for sure.
1445360	1447360	What do I got to do to get on the front page?
1448360	1450360	What were we talking about?
1451360	1452360	Divorce.
1452360	1455360	So there's a lot of Germans in the hotel.
1456360	1457360	Here we go.
1458360	1459360	Here we go.
1461360	1463360	I don't know if this is going to be a satisfying story.
1463360	1465360	You're saying that there's a large German contingent
1465360	1467360	dwelling in a hotel right now?
1467360	1469360	I don't know if it's like a ski team or something.
1469360	1471360	Something's happening at the hotel.
1471360	1472360	I just noticed a lot of...
1472360	1474360	It could be a convention of bankers.
1474360	1476360	It could be all sorts of things.
1477360	1478360	Who cares?
1478360	1480360	I'm just saying, I'm walking around and I'm hearing,
1480360	1483360	I'm seeing a lot of blonde people and I'm hearing like,
1484360	1486360	sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar.
1486360	1487360	Sugar, sugar, sugar.
1487360	1489360	Now baby, you're putting stuff on me.
1490360	1494360	And so I came out of my hotel and I got to the elevator
1494360	1499360	and there was a couple and they were waiting for the elevator too.
1499360	1501360	But they hadn't pushed the button.
1501360	1502360	And I know that...
1502360	1505360	It's a German stereotype that they just thought that
1505360	1507360	the elevator should heed their call.
1507360	1508360	I don't know.
1508360	1510360	I'm sure Germans are sick of that stereotype.
1510360	1512360	But I pushed it for them.
1512360	1514360	And then it...
1514360	1516360	But while they were having this very hushed conversation
1516360	1517360	and he's like,
1522360	1523360	And she's like,
1526360	1528360	And I'm like, okay, they're German, I think.
1528360	1529360	They could be anything.
1529360	1530360	There's 800 countries.
1530360	1531360	Who cares about any of them?
1531360	1533360	Unless you're going to bomb one.
1533360	1535360	And then it's like, well, what do they have?
1535360	1537360	But they get into the elevator.
1537360	1541360	But he waits for her to get in and then he waits for me to get in.
1542360	1544360	So I'm like, all right.
1544360	1548360	Like some weird German emasculation technique.
1548360	1550360	And I kind of step in.
1550360	1552360	Oh, because he's letting you on.
1552360	1556360	Well, he let his wife or partner or sister.
1556360	1557360	I don't know.
1557360	1558360	I'm not assuming anything.
1558360	1560360	But he let her on.
1560360	1563360	By the way, according to...
1566360	1567360	What is it?
1567360	1568360	Don't say...
1568360	1569360	Himmler.
1569360	1574360	No, the elevator, you would be surprised at what is actually etiquette for elevator.
1574360	1577360	The old school etiquette, like back in the early days when elevators were a new thing,
1577360	1582360	it's supposed to be that you let the men go on first in case it's going to fail.
1582360	1583360	They will be the ones that die.
1583360	1588360	Because etiquette hasn't been actually updated since elevators were dangerous.
1588360	1594360	So it's actually, if you want to go by actual books that have been published on the topic,
1594360	1598360	the actual etiquette is that a man is supposed to take the plunge
1598360	1605360	and get onto this disastrous new laser transporter and plummet to his death.
1605360	1606360	I don't like the one where...
1606360	1610360	What's the one where the guy is supposed to walk closer to the curb than the woman?
1610360	1612360	And they're like, some people say it's because...
1612360	1613360	If it's uphill and then if...
1613360	1616360	Because in case his brake goes out, then he'll just like drift into...
1616360	1617360	That's parking.
1617360	1618360	That's parking.
1620360	1622360	Yeah, you got to turn the woman into the...
1622360	1625360	You have to turn the woman toward the curb, like her back.
1625360	1628360	But everyone always turns her front toward the curb.
1628360	1631360	Your woman is going to like slide into the street.
1631360	1632360	That's like...
1632360	1635360	And there could be a car chase if you're in San Francisco.
1635360	1637360	Steve McQueen's coming to get you.
1637360	1640360	Yeah, the French connection is going to happen and you just lost a woman.
1640360	1641360	So...
1641360	1642360	I didn't know this.
1642360	1645360	I was like, I don't know, 18, 17.
1645360	1647360	And I was walking down the road and I was...
1647360	1648360	It had been raining out.
1648360	1651360	So I was walking on the inside of like...
1651360	1653360	No, no, I was...
1653360	1654360	What was I doing?
1654360	1655360	No, no, like...
1655360	1658360	She got mad at me for standing on the outside
1658360	1661360	because that makes her look like a prostitute, right?
1661360	1663360	Because you're supposed to walk on the inside?
1663360	1664360	No, the opposite way around?
1664360	1665360	I don't know.
1665360	1666360	This puddle is a prostitute.
1666360	1667360	I never figured it out.
1667360	1668360	Yeah.
1668360	1670360	Look for Jeff's children's book.
1670360	1671360	It's...
1671360	1673360	It's Puddles and Prostitutes.
1673360	1676360	And you open each page and then you have the kid let go
1676360	1677360	and he's supposed to guess.
1677360	1678360	Is it a puddle or a prostitute?
1678360	1679360	If you're a pimp, if you're a pimp...
1679360	1681360	I'm collected from the heavens.
1681360	1682360	Puddle.
1682360	1683360	No.
1683360	1684360	Prostitute.
1684360	1686360	World's oldest profession.
1686360	1689360	I'm content with the lowest places.
1689360	1690360	Puddle.
1696360	1699360	Anyways, so I got in the elevator.
1699360	1700360	And then it's just very quiet.
1700360	1701360	I don't know if...
1701360	1705360	I don't know if they were having a thing.
1705360	1711360	Like it was terse or if that's just German regular stuff.
1711360	1712360	Like...
1712360	1715360	Did they seem to be family or related?
1715360	1718360	Well, it's my perception, but I'm American.
1718360	1721360	So my perception is that God should be on your money
1721360	1723360	and everybody should go fuck themselves.
1723360	1725360	My perception is fucking retarded.
1725360	1727360	Oh, shit. God damn it.
1727360	1729360	My perception is that that word...
1729360	1731360	My sister's retarded.
1732360	1736360	And she just moved in with a woman who used to be a man.
1736360	1737360	So fuck all of you.
1737360	1738360	I wrote it.
1738360	1739360	All right.
1739360	1740360	Get out.
1740360	1741360	Get out.
1741360	1742360	Pull up.
1742360	1743360	Pull up.
1743360	1745360	This show brought to you by a Bud Light.
1748360	1750360	It was terse in the elevator and I wasn't sure.
1750360	1753360	I don't know because of the stereotype of the German people.
1753360	1754360	I don't know.
1754360	1756360	But they were quiet.
1756360	1759360	And then we ride down in silence.
1759360	1761360	And he's wearing like a ski jacket.
1761360	1764360	And she stared forward.
1764360	1767360	And he was sort of like 45 degree angle.
1767360	1768360	And I'm staring forward too.
1768360	1770360	And I'm at the door.
1770360	1776360	And it goes boom, boom, boom, boom.
1776360	1778360	Lobby opens up.
1778360	1780360	And there's a pause.
1780360	1782360	And then she steps out.
1782360	1785360	And then I'm just waiting because now this thing happened up there.
1785360	1787360	And I look over at him.
1787360	1788360	And he's facing.
1788360	1790360	And he goes like this.
1790360	1792360	He goes, please.
1795360	1797360	And I fucked off.
1797360	1799360	It was like Hans Gruber.
1799360	1802360	He just gritted his teeth and closed his eyes.
1802360	1805360	Please.
1805360	1807360	Give me three seconds away from her.
1807360	1808360	No, no.
1808360	1810360	No wonder they didn't laugh.
1810360	1811360	They all thought some weird thing.
1811360	1812360	No.
1812360	1814360	The guy was like, please get the fuck off the elevator.
1814360	1815360	All right.
1815360	1817360	Not a good story then, I guess.
1817360	1818360	No, it doesn't matter.
1818360	1822360	I was in the same elevator today going up to my hotel room at the same hotel.
1822360	1824360	And there was a family of French people.
1824360	1827360	And they were clearly mother, father, and child.
1827360	1830360	And I think there were two teenage children.
1830360	1833360	And they were all kind of giggling and laughing in French,
1833360	1835360	which I only know a few words of.
1835360	1837360	And they were kind of laughing.
1837360	1840360	And then I came in and hit my button.
1840360	1842360	But it didn't work because you had to put the card back in.
1842360	1844360	The wife kept putting the card in.
1844360	1845360	And I kept hitting the button.
1845360	1848360	But then somebody would come in and like, oh, can I stop the elevator?
1848360	1849360	And we had to keep doing it.
1849360	1851360	And so I kind of made a joke.
1851360	1853360	Before I knew they were all French.
1853360	1854360	I hadn't heard any French.
1854360	1855360	It's never going up.
1855360	1859360	And the guy goes, oh, no, no, no.
1859360	1862360	That was not.
1862360	1863360	Pa means not.
1863360	1864360	Right.
1864360	1865360	Yeah.
1865360	1866360	So then they all kind of giggled.
1866360	1867360	And I kind of gave him a smile.
1867360	1869360	Then they went quiet for a while.
1869360	1871360	And then he made another joke.
1871360	1873360	And I kind of sheepishly giggled.
1873360	1874360	I looked back around.
1874360	1876360	And I was like, meh.
1876360	1880360	Kind of like, you know, I get it all the time or whatever.
1880360	1882360	Because now they're talking about me.
1882360	1883360	And it happens three times.
1883360	1884360	I get off the elevator.
1884360	1885360	I go, bonsoir.
1885360	1886360	And they're like, oi.
1886360	1887360	Whoa.
1887360	1888360	He knows.
1888360	1890360	He knows everything we said.
1890360	1897360	We were throwing him what we thought was cryptic French shade.
1897360	1898360	Look at this guy.
1898360	1899360	He's wearing a jacket.
1899360	1900360	He's wearing the shoes.
1900360	1901360	He's wearing the jacket.
1901360	1902360	Not.
1902360	1906360	And everyone's like, oh.
1906360	1912360	I think bread is breakfast.
1912360	1913360	And yet we're thin.
1913360	1914360	I don't know why.
1914360	1918360	Well, probably because the bread isn't made by Tyson Foods,
1918360	1922360	a big sponsor of CISO.
1922360	1927360	They figured out how to make making bread inhumane Tyson.
1927360	1930360	There's just big factories full of bread.
1930360	1934360	Like, you thought yeast was beyond mistreatment.
1934360	1935360	But you should see the videos.
1935360	1936360	YouTube it.
1936360	1939360	It's just guys, like, stabbing with toothpicks.
1939360	1941360	Just like, hey, yeast.
1941360	1943360	And they're just, like, hitting the yeast.
1943360	1945360	And the yeast is like, ow, ow.
1945360	1948360	Like, they've found more things about yeast's capacity
1948360	1950360	for intelligence just from the abuse.
1950360	1952360	They found out that yeasts consume more sugars
1952360	1954360	and give up more carbon dioxide if they're
1954360	1955360	living in a state of terror.
1955360	1956360	Yes.
1956360	1957360	And it's more delicious.
1957360	1959360	Have you ever had a great cookie?
1959360	1961360	That yeast died scared.
1961360	1963360	So complain all you want.
1963360	1967360	But I guess fuck Christmas if, you know.
1967360	1968360	I don't know.
1968360	1970360	Like, just think about it for a little bit.
1970360	1971360	You're New Yorkers.
1971360	1976360	You probably aren't familiar with complication or dichotomy.
1976360	1982360	Hey, this probably isn't, like, a new thing.
1982360	1988360	But there was a country station playing on the thing.
1988360	1993360	So do we have any country western singers in here?
1993360	1996360	Anybody here been in the country band?
1996360	1997360	Country music?
1997360	1998360	Yeah.
1998360	2000360	It's not a big city for that, I guess.
2000360	2003360	But I'm just parsing this.
2003360	2005360	Like, because I've never really paid attention.
2005360	2008360	So the idea is, I've listened to three country songs in a row.
2008360	2015360	So the idea is, so you love outlaws because you have to,
2015360	2023360	but also the Bible because you have to, and chicken and beer
2023360	2027360	because you have to, and then just freedom.
2027360	2029360	But freedom is the most important thing.
2029360	2034360	The freedom to, like, the Bible and outlaws?
2035360	2038360	I don't understand.
2038360	2043360	All my fans are outlaws, and the outlaw style is here.
2043360	2045360	We like to go shopping at Kmart.
2045360	2048360	And I'm not the first person to point this out, but it's like,
2048360	2050360	how could they be so?
2050360	2051360	That's terrible.
2051360	2053360	I feel bad for them.
2053360	2058360	I'm an outlaw, but I like the Bible.
2058360	2060360	And the Constitution, the Second Amendment.
2060360	2062360	And I like bad nutrition.
2063360	2066360	I do too, but I don't consider that outlaw behavior.
2066360	2069360	I consider that actually the moments when I'm most capitulating.
2069360	2072360	How would you align yourself more of an outlaw?
2072360	2075360	More of just a guy, I'm just like a pig at a trough.
2075360	2078360	And I'm proud of it, and I'm like, this is good.
2078360	2081360	Like, see-so, sue-wee.
2081360	2083360	I'm just like, it's delicious.
2083360	2084360	Who made corn for me?
2084360	2086360	I love being a pig.
2086360	2089360	I never go, plus I'm an outlaw.
2089360	2091360	Because I would feel dumb if I did that.
2091360	2092360	I would be dumb.
2092360	2095360	Like, I don't think an outlaw should even be talking into a microphone.
2095360	2099360	Like, to an outlaw, he'd be like, why is this amplifying my voice?
2099360	2100360	I'm an outlaw.
2100360	2105360	I use lack of law to amplify my intent.
2105360	2108360	Like, microphones are for politics.
2108360	2111360	They're for guys with big giant mustaches with grease in them.
2111360	2113360	Like, the people that put up telephone poles.
2113360	2114360	I'm an outlaw.
2114360	2117360	I love not being in the law.
2117360	2119360	But I love the Bible.
2119360	2120360	Like, I love the Bible?
2120360	2122360	Like, the Bible is, like, all law.
2122360	2126360	Like, it's more laws than even just our laws.
2126360	2127360	Like, it's more laws.
2127360	2129360	There's laws in the Bible that aren't even law.
2129360	2131360	Like, extra laws.
2131360	2134360	Like, you remember the kid that was, like, loved math in school?
2134360	2137360	And he's like, I'm going to spend the summer doing math stuff.
2137360	2138360	That's what the Bible is.
2138360	2140360	It's, like, extra law.
2140360	2142360	But it's, like, laws that don't even make sense.
2142360	2144360	But the protagonist of the New Testament is an outlaw.
2144360	2145360	He's wanted by the Popos.
2145360	2148360	Yeah, but then there's a whole Bible about him.
2148360	2150360	And they added him to the Bible because he did that.
2150360	2151360	Is that what they're hoping?
2151360	2153360	There's going to be a Third Testament with Waylon Jennings in it?
2153360	2157360	Like, it's like, oh, this is how you do it.
2157360	2158360	I'm an outlaw.
2158360	2159360	I'm an outlaw.
2159360	2161360	How come no one's crucifying me?
2161360	2162360	Yeah.
2162360	2164360	I want to throw on a Bible about me.
2164360	2168360	About how I went shopping and fuck those shit.
2168360	2171360	I want a Bible about me.
2171360	2175360	Well, you're going to have to learn more chords.
2175360	2178360	First of all, by my definition, you have to learn more chords.
2178360	2183360	Maybe the dance moves could use a little punch up.
2183360	2184360	How are we doing on time?
2184360	2185360	Have I filled a half hour?
2185360	2187360	I think, I don't know exactly what you and I can do.
2187360	2191360	No, my goal is to fill a half hour.
2191360	2194360	I think we're quite close, actually, to going on to the second segment of our
2194360	2196360	Cavalcade of Stars tonight.
2196360	2200360	Okay, two more fun anecdotes about my personal life, which is very uneventful.
2200360	2204360	I got into the elevator another time.
2205360	2206360	This is what I do when I come to New York.
2206360	2211360	This show is a rich tapestry of ideas.
2211360	2214360	My room is, I'm not even going to change the numbers.
2214360	2217360	If you want to come kill me, just come kill me.
2217360	2221360	Because I wouldn't know how to riff a palindromic number like this.
2221360	2225360	My room is 611, but I got the thing, and it's upside down.
2225360	2227360	I thought I was in room 119.
2227360	2229360	So I'm like, wait, one?
2229360	2230360	It's New York.
2230360	2234360	I bet the one is up because it's New York because everything's vertical.
2234360	2238360	It's like you go to Walgreens, and it's like vitamins are 30 miles in the sky.
2238360	2242360	So I got in the elevator, and there's two women in there, and I was just like,
2242360	2243360	oh, I don't know.
2243360	2244360	There's no one button.
2244360	2248360	And then it opened on four, and there was just some kid with a luggage rack.
2248360	2252360	And I said, hey, hi, hi.
2252360	2254360	How do you get to one?
2254360	2255360	And he's like, what?
2255360	2257360	And I'm like, what is 119?
2257360	2258360	I don't know where to go.
2258360	2261360	And I held up the thing, and he's like, I think that's 611.
2261360	2263360	And I turned it upside down, and I was like, oh.
2263360	2268360	And the doors closed, and I turned to the ladies, having been raised on television and movies,
2268360	2272360	and I said, I don't get out much.
2272360	2279360	So if you don't get out much, the one thing that you might be adept at is number reading.
2279360	2282360	That's the one thing you can practice without getting out much.
2282360	2283360	I just thought that was funny.
2283360	2284360	I don't get out much.
2284360	2288360	Yeah, you don't get out so much that you use the line, I don't get out much.
2288360	2291360	And you think that that's just going to make sense, and it doesn't.
2291360	2293360	They're French.
2293360	2298360	And the other one was like, and the other one was like, I surrender.
2298360	2305360	And I was like, I'll step in, but it's going to cost you $70 trillion.
2305360	2306360	It's part of a 50-year plan.
2306360	2307360	Don't worry.
2307360	2309360	We'll be done by 99.
2310360	2319360	OK, I'm racist, divorce, Germans, country, brundle fly, whatever.
2319360	2320360	I want to have a brundle fly.
2320360	2321360	Oh, there was a guy.
2321360	2325360	I was driving with the car driver, what do you call him?
2325360	2327360	Drivers.
2327360	2329360	You never have to specify the vehicle.
2329360	2332360	I didn't come here in a truck.
2332360	2335360	And he said he was driving.
2335360	2336360	This is not.
2336360	2337360	This is not.
2337360	2342360	He was driving like this, a little tiny steering wheel holding a phone.
2342360	2343360	It was silent.
2343360	2344360	And he was driving.
2344360	2346360	And then he was driving for a while.
2346360	2348360	And I was just on this huge New York high.
2348360	2354360	Because by the way, my last six visits to York, I'm like, wait a minute.
2354360	2357360	New York's gimmick is that everyone's friendly.
2357360	2362360	It was like an 80s thing that was like, oh, everyone's so rude,
2362360	2364360	and they have so much to do, they don't have time to be polite.
2364360	2366360	No, it's the city where they all live together.
2366360	2369360	So they're all much more socially adept than everyone that comes here.
2369360	2372360	And you're always leaving here going, wow, that was really nice.
2372360	2374360	Everyone's really friendly and has character.
2374360	2377360	And even the meme people are a meme, but with an eye patch.
2377360	2379360	Everyone's got a gimmick.
2379360	2380360	They live on top of each other.
2380360	2382360	They can't afford to have issues.
2382360	2385360	No, they can't have issues, but they're color form issues.
2385360	2387360	It's like, I'm going to take these issues.
2387360	2388360	They're good people.
2388360	2389360	They're fun.
2389360	2390360	And they're nice.
2390360	2392360	And I'm going to collect them all.
2393360	2396360	But I was on this big New York high, and then I got into the car,
2396360	2397360	and then the guy's driving.
2397360	2401360	And it was kind of silent, and I was exhausted with New York love.
2401360	2404360	I was like, ah, I'm so tired of talking about how much I love New York.
2404360	2406360	So I was just quiet.
2406360	2411360	And then the driver went, because I was quiet, he's like, you know.
2411360	2414360	And I wrote it down, so I'm reading it.
2414360	2419360	I was driving this producer one time, Todd Black, and he said, you know,
2419360	2422360	I don't know how it is you do what you do.
2422360	2424360	Silence.
2424360	2429360	And I was like, well, now I hate New York.
2429360	2432360	And I know how you do what you do.
2432360	2434360	You press the gas pedal when the light turns green.
2434360	2438360	And I mean, I know the traffic's bad, but don't suck your own dick about it.
2438360	2439360	Like, that's crazy.
2439360	2440360	You're not a hero.
2440360	2442360	That's not it.
2442360	2447360	He would have been if, I'm sure Todd Black met him on a day when he didn't do that.
2447360	2448360	And then Todd Black was like, you're great.
2448360	2449360	You're great.
2449360	2450360	I don't know how you do what you do.
2450360	2451360	And he's like, I'm going to remember that.
2451360	2453360	And then I got into the car, and he's like, you know what Todd Black said to me?
2453360	2456360	And I'm like, well, now he shouldn't have.
2456360	2457360	You know?
2457360	2460360	I'm not sure I know what either what his angle was or your angle is on this.
2460360	2463360	Is he saying, oh, you're like all those producers.
2463360	2464360	You're condescending.
2464360	2465360	I don't know how you do what you do.
2465360	2466360	No, it was like there was silence.
2466360	2471360	And he was like, this is that moment when someone congenializes with me.
2471360	2472360	And it's not happening.
2472360	2475360	So he was like, you know, it's funny you should ask.
2475360	2477360	I am kind of a hero.
2478360	2479360	And I'm like, I didn't.
2479360	2483360	I was about to maybe come around to saying that after I caught my breath from buying
2483360	2484360	a jacket.
2484360	2485360	And now you're an enemy.
2485360	2488360	And I hate your whole city.
2488360	2490360	Hate everyone in it.
2490360	2492360	Yeah.
2492360	2493360	Should request?
2493360	2494360	No, no, no.
2494360	2497360	Let me do a rap about how I hate New York.
2497360	2500360	Let me hit him with the most sensitive element.
2500360	2502360	Yo, I hate your city.
2502360	2504360	I hate your city like a dude hates a titty.
2504360	2507360	He puts it in his mouth from the north to the south.
2507360	2510360	Gonna suck the milk like a good silk.
2510360	2513360	These raps are bad, but New York you've been had.
2513360	2515360	You've been told you're better than Boston.
2515360	2517360	And Vermont, that's a state.
2517360	2521360	What do you want from a guy that's not paid to rap?
2521360	2524360	I'm gonna fuck you tomorrow like crap.
2524360	2527360	The heat goes in her butt.
2527360	2528360	You press.
2528360	2529360	So what?
2529360	2533360	CSO is the place to be for dollars a month for comedy.
2533360	2535360	I put your mama till she started to pee.
2535360	2537360	I put his glass in a drankard town.
2537360	2540360	I said, turn your butt flat upside down.
2540360	2542360	And I put it in the fridge.
2542360	2545360	And I took your mama through the tunnel in the fridge.
2545360	2547360	You got some expression you guys using this town.
2554360	2555360	Where you going?
2555360	2556360	Where you going?
2556360	2557360	The fuck are you going?
2557360	2560360	No, that guy's got a show on CSO.
2560360	2561360	He's leaving.
2561360	2564360	He does one of the shows they're not promoting.
2564360	2568360	It's called Collecting Matches.
2568360	2569360	There's like, there's tears.
2569360	2570360	They don't tell you.
2570360	2572360	There's like tears of shows.
2572360	2573360	There's like, they're good cartoon.
2573360	2574360	And then there's my show.
2574360	2576360	And then at the bottom, it's like $5,000 an episode.
2576360	2578360	That guy's name is David Jenkins.
2578360	2580360	He's got a show called Collecting Matches.
2580360	2581360	It's not even a take.
2581360	2584360	It's just he literally collects matches.
2584360	2588360	Because it's a tax write off if they have a certain amount of shows launched.
2588360	2589360	How many do you have now?
2589360	2590360	700?
2590360	2591360	Do you have any matches?
2591360	2595360	No, see, that's the whole episode.
2595360	2596360	He just asks that.
2596360	2598360	That's all he does.
2598360	2599360	No, I don't.
2599360	2600360	No one does.
2600360	2601360	Why would anyone have matches?
2601360	2603360	Smoking's practically illegal.
2603360	2605360	We're not outside.
2605360	2606360	It's a terrible show.
2606360	2607360	He's an outlaw.
2607360	2609360	He's not an outlaw.
2611360	2615360	He's an outlaw to like Australopithecine.
2615360	2617360	Because he has, he can make fire.
2617360	2621360	Which is against the law, because they probably had a god that was supposed to do that.
2621360	2623360	It's time to move on to our second segment.
2623360	2624360	Okay, all right.
2624360	2626360	All right, so we're going to create a division here.
2626360	2631360	That was just for press release.
2631360	2635360	That was just for TMZ and Buzzfeed.
2635360	2641360	And now we're going to give you a sneak preview of our HarmonQuest content.
2641360	2642360	Right?
2642360	2643360	That's what we're doing.
2643360	2647360	We're doing the live portion of what will later, would later on be animated?
2647360	2648360	Right.
2648360	2653360	We're going to play a fantasy role-playing game with celebrity guests.
2653360	2660360	Well, Ethan Fickel and David Doot come on stage, please.
2660360	2661360	I know what you're thinking.
2661360	2662360	Why aren't the celebrities...
2662360	2664360	No, god damn it, don't step on the fucking...
2664360	2669360	Although it's been tested for eight U's.
2669360	2670360	You have another mic?
2670360	2672360	Yeah, I think we're down a mic.
2672360	2673360	Oh, there it is.
2673360	2674360	There it is.
2674360	2675360	Cool.
2675360	2676360	All right, Dave and Ethan.
2676360	2677360	Yeah.
2677360	2678360	It's David and Ethan, everybody.
2678360	2679360	All right.
2679360	2680360	Stop it.
2680360	2685360	Mom, come on, Mom.
2685360	2690360	You guys all know which one's Dave.
2690360	2692360	Point at him.
2692360	2693360	The hot one.
2693360	2694360	The sweater.
2694360	2695360	It's the hot one.
2695360	2697360	And you know which one's Ethan.
2697360	2698360	It's the checkered shirt one.
2698360	2699360	That's me.
2699360	2700360	All right, good.
2700360	2701360	All right, we're on.
2701360	2703360	We're going to sit, but I didn't know if it was a lot to sit or not.
2703360	2704360	No, no, no.
2704360	2705360	I don't sit until he sits.
2705360	2706360	No, take a load off.
2706360	2707360	It's been a hard night.
2707360	2708360	No, no, no.
2708360	2709360	Okay.
2709360	2710360	Okay.
2710360	2711360	Great line.
2711360	2712360	No, no, not toward me.
2712360	2713360	Okay.
2713360	2714360	All right.
2714360	2715360	If you like to.
2715360	2716360	I'll just go fuck myself.
2716360	2717360	Okay.
2717360	2718360	Sorry.
2718360	2719360	Here we go.
2719360	2720360	We're good.
2720360	2721360	Okay, so we're going to play a half hour.
2721360	2722360	Okay.
2722360	2723360	Yeah.
2723360	2724360	Just to make sure, do we have a half hour?
2724360	2725360	We've gone very long already, haven't we?
2725360	2726360	Yeah.
2726360	2727360	Oh, have we?
2727360	2728360	What time do we need to lug her off into the night?
2728360	2729360	Yeah.
2729360	2730360	Okay.
2730360	2731360	Okay.
2731360	2732360	People want to get up and go like pee and drink at some point.
2732360	2733360	I imagine.
2733360	2734360	Don't convince them of that.
2734360	2735360	No, nobody does.
2735360	2736360	You would stay.
2736360	2737360	Oh yeah.
2737360	2738360	They are.
2738360	2739360	They all have TV shows.
2739360	2740360	I mean, use your voice.
2740360	2741360	If you have information for us, let us know.
2741360	2742360	We got 10.
2742360	2743360	We got 10 minutes.
2743360	2744360	Lightning around.
2744360	2745360	David Ethan.
2745360	2746360	I've never.
2746360	2747360	Great job.
2747360	2752360	You guys are not, uh, uh, D and D or, or role-playing, uh,
2752360	2753360	aficionados, right?
2753360	2754360	No, no.
2754360	2755360	Okay.
2755360	2756360	This is perfect.
2756360	2758360	But they were, they were the ones that were on our show, did not,
2758360	2759360	uh, had not ever played it before.
2759360	2764360	Uh, so, uh, Spencer, uh, we'll we'll lead us off with, uh, one of Spencer's
2764360	2766360	fantastic, uh, intros.
2766360	2767360	Well, no, you won't.
2767360	2768360	Uh, I don't know why you think that.
2768360	2769360	Oh, you.
2769360	2770360	Oh, we want.
2770360	2771360	Yeah.
2771360	2773360	This is a, the thing is, this is a standalone story.
2773360	2776360	It's like a microcosm of what we're going to bring to you.
2776360	2779360	But what we're going to bring to you with Harmon Quest is actually, it's
2779360	2783360	been written by me in terms of like, you know, the D and D story.
2783360	2785360	Um, and I, I had all this time to prepare, but this is like a 10,
2785360	2790360	minute, uh, you know, attempt at recapturing that magic without any of
2790360	2792360	the expertise or prep work.
2792360	2794360	So we're set up for success is what you're saying.
2794360	2795360	Yeah.
2795360	2796360	Yeah.
2796360	2797360	Slam dunk.
2797360	2798360	Spencer, do you want Spencer music?
2798360	2803360	Is there anybody here that needs anything to be undercut in any way?
2803360	2805360	I just want to set everyone's expertise.
2805360	2806360	No, no.
2806360	2807360	We record for an hour.
2807360	2808360	We've all done it.
2808360	2810360	We record for an hour and we cut it down to 20 minutes.
2810360	2812360	Here you're going to see us play only 10 minutes.
2812360	2814360	So figure it out.
2815360	2816360	Okay.
2816360	2818360	He takes it seriously is the point.
2818360	2819360	Yeah.
2819360	2820360	No, that's my job.
2820360	2821360	Okay.
2821360	2823360	You saw that, uh, you saw that documentary about the guy that dreams of
2823360	2826360	sushi and then makes a really high maintenance meal for you and it costs
2826360	2829360	$700 and the whole time you're sitting there going, I hope I don't eat this
2829360	2830360	wrong.
2830360	2832360	It's, it's, it's artisanal.
2832360	2834360	I should charge $700 for this.
2834360	2835360	That's insane.
2835360	2838360	Is that really what you pay for sushi?
2838360	2839360	Yeah.
2839360	2840360	You guys are fucking idiots.
2840360	2841360	I'm sure it's.
2841360	2842360	All right.
2842360	2843360	So now we get, we get sheet.
2843360	2844360	Just go top to bottom top.
2844360	2846360	We have eight minutes left of this.
2846360	2847360	Yeah.
2847360	2848360	That's what I'm just.
2848360	2849360	I mean, yeah.
2849360	2850360	That's it.
2850360	2851360	It'll be, it'll be great.
2851360	2852360	Okay.
2852360	2853360	750.
2853360	2854360	We'll get a chance to start.
2854360	2855360	Oh, nice.
2855360	2856360	Then we'll go party.
2856360	2857360	Oh my gosh.
2857360	2858360	All right.
2858360	2859360	Great.
2859360	2860360	I'm just going to start.
2860360	2861360	Okay.
2861360	2862360	Dan, you're playing a character named fondue.
2862360	2863360	Jeff, you're playing a character named bone weevil.
2863360	2864360	I can do it.
2864360	2865360	Bone weevil.
2865360	2866360	Fondue and bone weevil.
2866360	2871360	You're at the earth scar ale house, the local tavern around these parts.
2871360	2876080	It's a dreary place for the lost souls that wandered through town enjoying the strong
2876080	2878240	brews and dark corners.
2878240	2879840	You're sat at the bar.
2879840	2881680	Hey, fondue.
2881680	2882680	Whoa.
2882680	2883680	I'm really drunk.
2883680	2885120	I'm really drunk right now.
2885120	2886120	Do I know him?
2886120	2887120	Yeah.
2887120	2888120	Hey.
2888120	2889120	What do you mean?
2889120	2890120	Do you know me?
2890120	2891120	I wasn't talking to you.
2891120	2892120	You know me.
2892120	2893120	I didn't say that out loud.
2893120	2894120	Huh?
2894120	2895120	Dude.
2895120	2896120	All right.
2896120	2900080	I mean, we don't know each other well, but I, we come to the same bar all the time.
2900080	2902040	We speak, but you're always in a blackout drunk.
2902040	2903040	You're a giant.
2903040	2904040	What are you, a half orc or something?
2904040	2905040	Yeah.
2905040	2906040	Yeah.
2906040	2907040	Look, I'm just a little goblin.
2907040	2909880	I'm just a little, little, little, probably what, three feet?
2909880	2913840	But your conversation is interrupted by the arrival of two gentlemen.
2913840	2914840	Oh, shit.
2914840	2915840	Oh.
2915840	2918360	You see two brothers with matching facial tattoos.
2918360	2920800	Actually, they're not brothers.
2920800	2922360	They're clearly of different races.
2922360	2924360	One's a half orc and one's an elf.
2924360	2925360	Oh.
2925360	2926360	Oh.
2926360	2927360	Hark Harken.
2927360	2928360	Is that, did we say that?
2928360	2929360	Yeah.
2929640	2930640	Harken, hello.
2930640	2936040	We are seeking the crown of the rat king, which might be found in the tomb of the rat
2936040	2937760	king.
2937760	2941360	For I am divorceous.
2941360	2943600	And I am, it's for the bestiest.
2943600	2944600	Wow.
2944600	2945600	Yes.
2945600	2955880	Guys, I pulled him aside and I go, do you, do you, do you know where the rat, where the,
2955880	2958160	where the rat king tomb be?
2958160	2964400	I have heard that it is in the tomb of the rat king.
2964400	2965400	That's what I heard.
2965400	2968160	That's what Joe, Joe Smigge told me.
2968160	2973760	I use my, my knowledge of nature or the local, local area to just, do I know where the rat
2973760	2974760	tomb is, Spencer?
2974760	2975760	Oh yeah.
2975760	2979480	No, everybody knows that the tomb of the rat king is in the forest outside of town.
2979480	2984200	I say we put our drinks down and get the hell over there and what are we looking for again
2984200	2985200	in the thing?
2985200	2986200	We're trying to find the crown.
2986200	2987200	The crown.
2987240	2989960	And when we get there, we're going to split the money.
2989960	2990960	Yeah.
2990960	2991960	Okay.
2991960	2992960	Okay.
2992960	2993960	It's good to say these things.
2993960	2994960	It's like a divorce.
2994960	2996920	You want to get this stuff set out before you get into it.
2996920	2997920	Right.
2997920	2999560	It's like a prenup for an adventure.
2999560	3000560	Right.
3000560	3004640	Normally there'd be more of a refusal of the call, which would result in immersiveness,
3004640	3006080	but this is more like a porno.
3006080	3007080	So let's.
3007080	3008080	Yeah.
3008080	3009080	Just quick.
3009080	3010080	My sink's clogged.
3010080	3011080	Let's fuck.
3011080	3012080	No, no, no, no.
3012080	3013080	All right.
3013080	3014080	Fondue, refuse the call.
3014080	3015080	I don't know if I should do it.
3015080	3016080	All right.
3016080	3017080	Let's go.
3017600	3020200	He reads my eyes.
3020200	3024600	I have a wagon outside with a couple mules.
3024600	3027040	It's funny, getting my wagon.
3027040	3029080	How many wheels does this wagon have?
3029080	3030360	It's a two-wheeled wagon.
3030360	3031360	It's not a great wagon.
3031360	3034160	The horses are the front wheels, basically.
3034160	3035160	We're not used to those.
3035160	3036440	Do you have horse-wheeled wagons?
3036440	3037440	No, no.
3037440	3041600	The horses work as front wheels, so the two wheels would just fall over, but the horses
3041600	3042680	hold it up.
3042680	3045320	Is there a safety harness on this wagon to ensure that I...
3045320	3046680	Otherwise the things would fall off.
3046680	3048840	I say we get in it for the money shot.
3048840	3049840	Let's go.
3049840	3050840	Let's do it.
3050840	3051840	We shall go for the shot of money.
3051840	3053840	I have a few more questions about the safety...
3053840	3054840	Oh, God.
3054840	3055840	Yes.
3055840	3056840	Features of this wagon.
3056840	3057840	I thought I was all alone.
3057840	3058840	Should we collide with a tree?
3058840	3059840	Well...
3059840	3060840	You already refused the call back in the bar.
3060840	3061840	You don't get to refuse the wagon.
3061840	3062840	All right.
3062840	3063840	I'll get the wagon.
3063840	3064840	All right.
3064840	3065840	Yeah, mules.
3065840	3066840	Oh.
3066840	3067840	Oh, whoa.
3067840	3068840	Wow.
3068840	3069840	Right, pretty smooth, doesn't it?
3069840	3070840	Yes.
3070840	3071840	Pretty two-wheeled affair.
3071840	3072840	How do you reach the...
3072840	3073840	You're so small.
3073840	3074840	How do you reach the...
3074840	3075840	The horses do all the research.
3075840	3078680	I just take a little whip and hit their butts.
3078680	3080800	Can we hit a tree to taste the harness?
3080800	3082800	Or to test it?
3082800	3083800	And taste it.
3083800	3084800	I'd like to taste the harness.
3084800	3085800	My brother hates harnesses.
3085800	3086800	And it's a tasty harness.
3086800	3090960	Soon you find yourselves outside of the rat king's tomb.
3090960	3092560	Oh, shit.
3092560	3096840	You're standing in front of a massive slab of obsidian in the forest outside of town.
3096840	3099760	This black monolith seems to absorb all light.
3099760	3104960	And a gray stone door sits in the center with golden script scrawled all over it.
3104960	3106320	There's also a doorknob.
3106320	3110800	I don't think we should have left that bar.
3110800	3111800	You drove.
3111800	3113280	I'm refusing to call in front of you.
3113280	3114280	Okay.
3114280	3115280	Well, you can't do that the whole adventure.
3115280	3117280	That's just like an E-Lag Roth movie.
3117280	3120400	It's just people going, don't do it, don't do it.
3120400	3121400	My eyeball.
3121400	3123840	Anyways, guys, what do you think?
3123840	3126960	You're the ones who are here.
3126960	3130160	I go examine the golden script to see if it's a language I know.
3130160	3131160	It's in Dwarven.
3131160	3132160	All right.
3132160	3133160	I speak Dwarven.
3133160	3134160	I read the thing.
3134360	3137760	Touch the door with your left hand and then just turn the knob and push.
3137760	3141760	I know a trap when I see one, fellas.
3141760	3143160	Do I have traps sense?
3143160	3144160	Yeah.
3144160	3146760	We don't know what you're talking about because all that happened to you internally.
3146760	3147760	I'm a stickler.
3147760	3148760	That's entertainment.
3148760	3151160	I have perception.
3151160	3153160	Can I check to see if this is a trap?
3153160	3154160	Oh, yeah.
3154160	3155160	Let me see here.
3155160	3156160	Yeah.
3156160	3157160	Am I going to get a dice roll?
3157160	3158160	Oh, yeah.
3158160	3159160	You just got it.
3159160	3160160	Oh, yes.
3160160	3161160	Feels good, doesn't it?
3161160	3162160	Yeah.
3162160	3163160	I'm so excited.
3163160	3166160	It's highly magical, but not trapped.
3166160	3167160	That's good.
3167160	3168160	All right.
3168160	3169160	Oh.
3169160	3170160	Somebody go put their left hand on it and turn it.
3170160	3172160	I shall put my left hand.
3172160	3178160	I will not use my stunning fist, but I can if I want to, just letting everyone know.
3178160	3179160	You have a stunning fist?
3179160	3180160	Yeah.
3180160	3181160	Yeah.
3181160	3182160	You talk to us about them a lot.
3182160	3183160	Can I see it?
3183160	3184160	Yes.
3184160	3187160	It will be featured in room 611 later.
3187160	3189160	Wow.
3189160	3192160	I'll bring the magical lube.
3192160	3194160	It is stunning.
3194160	3195160	Oh.
3195160	3199160	Permission to open door with my left arm.
3199160	3200160	Doing those things.
3200160	3203160	You open the door easily.
3203160	3207160	It swings open, revealing a staircase headed downwards.
3207160	3208160	Oh.
3208160	3209160	Hey, you there.
3209160	3210160	Town, boys.
3210160	3215160	What would be your interest in this rat crown?
3215160	3220160	We've heard many legends I've never seen your like in the tavern.
3220160	3221160	Fancy talk.
3222160	3224160	Game of Thrones talking.
3224160	3225160	Yes.
3225160	3226160	On my face.
3226160	3229160	Do you notice the rat?
3229160	3230160	Yeah.
3230160	3234160	I told that rat one day that I would find his crown.
3234160	3235160	Nice.
3235160	3238160	But in the meantime, I would tattoo him to my face.
3238160	3240160	Oh, those are rat tattoos on your face.
3240160	3241160	Yes, that is correct.
3241160	3244160	I was there and so I was in the background tattooing myself too.
3244160	3245160	Yeah.
3245160	3246160	He's my bestie.
3246160	3252160	You met a rat that died and you quest to get his crown back, right?
3252160	3253160	Yes.
3253160	3254160	Yes.
3254160	3257160	It doesn't exactly send a signal to the rats, don't fuck with these people.
3257160	3259160	You kind of ended up worshipping them.
3259160	3260160	Yes.
3260160	3262160	Yes, I'm a big rat worshipper.
3262160	3265160	You fed the trolls, as they say on Twitter.
3265160	3267160	Indeed I did.
3267160	3272160	You should take time every once in a while to tell non-rats, thank you, I liked my show too.
3273160	3277160	Do a ratio of three to ten, that way when they say,
3277160	3281160	I know you only respond to haters, so I guess you won't see this.
3281160	3283160	Then you can tell that person, fuck you, you piece of shit.
3283160	3284160	Yeah.
3284160	3286160	I respond positively all the time, you little fuck.
3286160	3287160	Okay.
3287160	3289160	We know not what you speak of at all.
3289160	3290160	No, not at all.
3290160	3295160	I saw angels in a different world where stakes were lower, but anxiety was higher.
3295160	3297160	Yes.
3297160	3299160	So we're inside the tomb right now, Spencer?
3299160	3300160	Oh, yeah.
3301160	3303160	It's just a staircase though.
3303160	3304160	Oh.
3304160	3307160	I elect you to proceed first.
3307160	3310160	Okay, I'm little and agile and I have dark, is it lit, dark?
3310160	3311160	What is it?
3311160	3315160	Out of the corner of your eyes, Fondue, you can see,
3315160	3317160	you can see as Bone Weevil heads down the stairs,
3317160	3320160	the brothers, they seem to be drawing their weapons as if in ambush.
3320160	3323160	Hey, stop, Bone Weevil, don't, these guys, whoa.
3323160	3325160	You believe the rat stories?
3325160	3326160	I see.
3326160	3327160	No.
3327160	3328160	Yes.
3328160	3331160	I go back up the stairs.
3331160	3333160	You damn it.
3333160	3336160	I only went down a few stairs, I'm little, I only went down like three stairs.
3336160	3337160	I'm back up.
3337160	3340160	Out of acrobatics, can I chase him down?
3340160	3341160	I think he went up though.
3341160	3342160	Okay.
3342160	3343160	I went up.
3343160	3346160	Okay, I go back down to meet everybody.
3346160	3347160	I guess I misheard.
3347160	3351160	No, no, actually, I go down one step so I keep a high advantage
3351160	3354160	to level the playing field and I draw my rapier.
3354160	3356160	I'm sorry, what was that?
3357160	3359160	My sword.
3359160	3362160	It's spelled rapier, but it's a sword.
3362160	3364160	It's not that kind of crowd that's been established.
3364160	3367160	I apologize.
3367160	3371160	I shall put my stunning fist away.
3371160	3373160	I think they like stunning fists.
3373160	3374160	No, they like that.
3374160	3377160	It's like, Kevin James, you're home jerking off.
3377160	3378160	That's fine.
3378160	3380160	Totally.
3380160	3382160	You guys are in some sort of standoff situation.
3383160	3386160	Well, drop your weapons.
3386160	3388160	I draw my bastard sword.
3388160	3389160	All right.
3389160	3391160	Now everyone has drawn their weapons.
3391160	3393160	Not everybody has to die here today.
3393160	3395160	In fact, nobody has to.
3395160	3398160	I offer a tree token.
3402160	3404160	It's a strange ambush tactic.
3404160	3406160	Yes.
3406160	3409160	I say don't fall for the tree token thing.
3409160	3413160	I'm falling for it and being intrigued by it are two different things.
3413160	3414160	I do.
3414160	3415160	I'm intrigued.
3415160	3417160	Are you going to take my tree token?
3417160	3418160	Tell me more.
3418160	3422160	Well, you take my tree token and now that you've gotten us in here,
3422160	3426160	you just walk away and let us have this rat treasure for ourselves.
3426160	3429160	I continue up the staircase while they're having this conversation.
3429160	3432160	It's a downward staircase.
3432160	3433160	Okay.
3433160	3435160	I'm going back down the staircase now.
3435160	3438160	I think I want to get to this crown before they do
3438160	3440160	and then I'll have the leverage.
3440160	3450160	Suppose I took your token and used it to once a month by unlimited access.
3450160	3451160	What?
3451160	3454160	To all previous adventures.
3454160	3457160	What sorts of adventures speak of?
3457160	3459160	Yeah, everything but Mr. Show.
3459160	3460160	Oh, yeah.
3460160	3462160	I don't know what happened there.
3462160	3463160	Is this HPO?
3463160	3464160	Almost comprehensive.
3464160	3467160	Yeah, and not community because that's Sony.
3467160	3468160	Yeah.
3468160	3470160	Everything that NBC has ever owned.
3470160	3471160	Right.
3471160	3472160	NBC.
3472160	3473160	Nathaniel.
3473160	3474160	Off of our.
3474160	3475160	Yes, obviously.
3475160	3476160	Nathaniel.
3476160	3477160	Great.
3477160	3478160	Check it.
3478160	3480160	I don't know.
3480160	3485160	While they do industry talk, I examine the bottom of the staircase.
3485160	3487160	Oh, oh, man.
3487160	3490160	You just see a circular room.
3490160	3493160	Its walls are peppered in fist-sized holes.
3493160	3497160	You can hear the chittering of mice and rats.
3497160	3501160	I have fists that stunt.
3501160	3508160	These holes which are shaped fist-sized.
3508160	3512160	You've been here and punched here?
3512160	3514160	Is it like me in Wisconsin?
3514160	3515160	I don't know.
3515160	3516160	What are you saying?
3516160	3518160	For the sake of this, I run back up the stairs and go,
3518160	3519160	guys, there's fist-sized holes down here.
3519160	3521160	You have a stunning fist.
3521160	3522160	Right.
3522160	3523160	Oh, oh, oh.
3523160	3524160	I thought you were, okay.
3524160	3525160	I was Game of Thrones-ing it.
3525160	3527160	Oh, terribly.
3527160	3530160	I will punch every hole.
3530160	3535160	And I will go on the other side of the holes if there's a door that leads me to that area
3535160	3539160	and I won't know who's punching through those holes because it won't matter
3539160	3542160	and that will make it hotter.
3542160	3548160	And glory be to us in this world of holes.
3548160	3550160	I'm just trying anything I can.
3550160	3552160	It all is wonderful.
3552160	3555160	By the way, did I tell you about my vow of poverty?
3555160	3556160	No.
3556160	3558160	I'm going to turn to the dwarf over here.
3558160	3559160	I'm a goblin, asshole.
3559160	3561160	A goblin and say, well, they're dealing with this crap.
3561160	3562160	Let's get this crown.
3562160	3564160	We shall form an alliance.
3564160	3567160	I think we probably have to put a fist in these...
3567160	3568160	Yeah, he did it.
3568160	3569160	Yeah, yeah.
3569160	3570160	He just did it on my dumb joke.
3570160	3571160	He fisted the holes.
3571160	3572160	I was Yankovic-ing.
3572160	3573160	Punch the holes.
3573160	3574160	What happened, Spencer?
3574160	3576160	You get bitten by rats.
3576160	3578160	Oh!
3578160	3580160	Oh, it's here for you, rats!
3580160	3587160	That's what happens when you draw swords on people on stairs.
3587160	3589160	So he tries every hole and doesn't work?
3589160	3590160	Just for answer in there?
3590160	3591160	Yeah.
3591160	3592160	I mean, you could...
3592160	3594160	They appear to be mouse holes.
3594160	3595160	Oh, they're mouse holes.
3595160	3596160	Yeah.
3596160	3597160	Oh, they're not for stunning fists.
3597160	3598160	They're just for mice.
3598160	3599160	No.
3599160	3600160	Is there anything else in the room?
3600160	3601160	Yeah.
3601160	3603160	What is it?
3603160	3607160	Oh, let me see here.
3607160	3611160	You see what looks like a stunningly beautiful woman.
3611160	3615160	Oh!
3615160	3617160	You've already fisted those holes,
3617160	3620160	but I can now use my burning hands on the woman.
3620160	3622160	Ah.
3622160	3623160	I blush.
3623160	3625160	I'm like, sorry about these guys.
3625160	3627160	I just met him in a bar.
3627160	3630160	It's like, all right, happy hour.
3630160	3633160	He's using burning hands on the woman.
3633160	3636160	You spread your hands and shoot fire all over the room.
3636160	3637160	What?
3637160	3638160	Wow.
3638160	3642160	It swirls around and consumes many rats
3642160	3645160	that are lying around on the ground.
3645160	3646160	But not the woman, I hope.
3646160	3649160	You realize that that woman was never there.
3649160	3651160	You just were so bad at looking around
3651160	3653160	that you thought you saw something.
3653160	3654160	Again!
3654160	3655160	Always.
3655160	3656160	Like usual.
3656160	3659160	Now, watch this.
3659160	3662160	I look around.
3662160	3663160	All right.
3663160	3665160	Well, you see a very obvious door.
3665160	3669160	Ah.
3669160	3671160	Not a woman at all.
3671160	3674160	A door that is here on demand.
3674160	3676160	What?
3676160	3678160	That you can watch.
3678160	3680160	I open any time you want.
3680160	3682160	Am I trying too hard to integrate?
3682160	3684160	Does the door open instantly
3684160	3686160	so that you can be entertained by the door?
3686160	3687160	Please, it's curated.
3687160	3689160	There's the door, like, you can...
3689160	3690160	You need to do whatever you want,
3690160	3694160	but by default, the door is already flapping open and shut.
3694160	3695160	Right.
3695160	3696160	And you approach it.
3696160	3699160	Is this door constructed of materials
3699160	3701160	across the pond as well?
3701160	3704160	Yeah, mostly, because that's the cheapest.
3704160	3705160	Yes.
3705160	3707160	It's not red dwarf.
3707160	3709160	I go up to the door, Spencer.
3709160	3710160	I go up to the door.
3710160	3711160	It's a door.
3711160	3712160	I open the door.
3712160	3713160	All right.
3713160	3715160	And I turn back before I open the door.
3715160	3716160	I turn back and go,
3716160	3718160	hey, remember that time you guys all thought you saw a lady
3718160	3720160	and you tried to burn her first off?
3720160	3721160	I don't know what it is.
3721160	3722160	Yeah.
3722160	3724160	Before that, when you started to murder us?
3724160	3726160	Like, did they draw on it?
3726160	3727160	Yes.
3727160	3728160	But we made friends.
3728160	3730160	It's kind of a delicate detente going on right now.
3730160	3732160	What do we see inside this new place?
3732160	3734160	Oh, man, you see a hexagonal room.
3734160	3736160	Metal coins litter the floor,
3736160	3739160	as do rats who don't seem bothered by your presence.
3739160	3741160	Oh, they're nice rats.
3741160	3743160	The walls have crude carvings of rats,
3743160	3746160	as well as crude carvings of a crowned man wielding a club,
3746160	3750160	as well as crude carvings of a man sitting on a throne of rats.
3750160	3753160	In the far wall, you see a rotting wooden throne,
3753160	3758160	and in it, a skeletal skeleton wearing a golden crown.
3758160	3761160	Thanks, Obama.
3761160	3762160	I don't know.
3762160	3763160	It's just trying.
3763160	3764160	Just trying.
3764160	3766160	We have like one and a half minutes left.
3766160	3767160	That's why, what do you think?
3767160	3769160	Bring the girl back.
3769160	3771160	No, she's gone.
3771160	3773160	Those three different wooden thingies
3773160	3776160	are in the way of the guy in the throne?
3776160	3778160	I'm sorry, what?
3779160	3781160	There was a thing with a guy sitting...
3781160	3782160	There's carvings on the walls.
3782160	3783160	Carvings on the walls.
3783160	3785160	There's a skeleton with a throne crown on it.
3785160	3786160	You sit on the throne.
3786160	3788160	It's a pictograph.
3788160	3791160	It's instructions.
3791160	3793160	There's a guy, and there's rats,
3793160	3794160	and then the guy sits on the...
3794160	3795160	Is there a throne?
3795160	3797160	Yeah, the throne is real.
3797160	3798160	I...
3798160	3800160	And the guy has a staff, right?
3800160	3801160	No.
3801160	3802160	What?
3802160	3803160	No, just shut up.
3803160	3804160	Don't shut up.
3804160	3805160	I didn't mean that.
3805160	3807160	I sit on the throne.
3807160	3809160	There's a skeleton sitting in the throne.
3809160	3810160	Well, I...
3810160	3812160	And it's wearing a gold crown.
3812160	3814160	Oh, take the crown.
3814160	3815160	Take the crown.
3815160	3816160	Take the crown.
3816160	3817160	Hold it.
3817160	3818160	Hold it.
3818160	3822160	That crown, everything else is yours.
3822160	3825160	The crown is one-eyed Willy's.
3828160	3830160	You're gonna give us all the rats?
3830160	3832160	Are you doing goonies?
3832160	3835160	Yeah, I wanted to create a dividing line in the audience
3835160	3838160	between everyone over 40 and everyone under 20.
3838160	3839160	I hope you succeed.
3839160	3842160	Sadly, we're ending that on a goonies, real friends!
3842160	3844160	We're gonna find out what happens.
3844160	3845160	Ethan's excelled.
3845160	3847160	You won't know.
3847160	3849160	Spencer Crichton.
3849160	3851160	Come on, Spencer, everybody.
3854160	3856160	Thank you again, Ebony Pirell.
3856160	3857160	Everybody, it's Cecil for having us here.
3857160	3859160	Thank you, New York TV Festival.
3859160	3861160	Thank you, School of Visual Arts.

3862160	3864160	You're mayor of Dan Hyman, everybody.
3866160	3867160	You're welcome.
3870160	3872160	Spencer Crichton in your Game Master.
3872160	3873160	I think we thanked everybody, right?
3873160	3875160	I hope Cecil and Jeff thanked everybody.
3875160	3882160	He thanked Natalie and John and Rupert, all of whom have cancer.
3883160	3888160	They don't know it, but I talked to their doctor tonight.
3893160	3896160	$4.00 a month is low.
3896160	3898160	If you're gonna do it, do it.
3898160	3899160	No more rapping.
3899160	3900160	Oh, it's freezing now.
3900160	3901160	No more rapping.
3901160	3902160	You're gonna see it.
3902160	3903160	And then how?
3903160	3904160	Monty Python.
3904160	3905160	Everybody get the hell out of here.
3905160	3906160	Oh shit, Amy Poehler.
3906160	3907160	How?
3907160	3908160	All the comedy.
3908160	3909160	All the time.
3909160	3911160	Cecil's gonna fuck it with a special round.
3911160	3913160	Did you get any of that?
3913160	3916160	It's include a show.
3922160	3923160	Audio.
