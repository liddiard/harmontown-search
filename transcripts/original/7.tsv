0	24560	Hear ye, hear ye, Herman Town is now in session.
24560	29080	Welcome to the Nerd Male Theater in Hollywood, California, and you listening out in the podcast
29080	30080	lab.
30080	31080	Thank you for joining us.
31080	34280	Please, won't you all either physically or spiritually put your hands together for the
34280	47160	mayor of Harmon Town, Mr. Dan Harmon.
47160	49120	Thank you.
49120	50120	Thank you.
50120	53120	Are you going to be in trouble tonight, pink hair?
53120	54120	No, I'm not.
54120	55120	I promise.
55120	56120	All right.
56120	57120	Met pink hair in line.
57160	60160	I parked here earlier to go meet some friends and...
60160	62160	You pulled me a kiss.
62160	65160	Well, yeah, because you screamed at me and I was terrified.
65160	66160	Well, that's not very accurate.
66160	69160	I blew you a kiss because I was afraid for my own safety.
69160	70160	Well, that's your reaction.
70160	71160	Like, you pulled me a kiss.
71160	73160	Well, what's your name, for fuck's sake?
73160	74160	Christina.
74160	75160	Christina.
75160	77160	Christina, everybody.
77160	79160	Security, keep an eye on Christina.
79160	81160	You may regret that applause in a moment.
81200	86200	Cynthia, Christina, pink hair.
86200	89200	Pink hair is only primary crime.
89200	91200	She's very excited to be here tonight.
91200	92200	Very excited.
92200	95200	Very excited to be near either of us.
95200	97200	Very excited to be here with all of you.
97200	102200	Unfortunately, her secondary crime, her excitement is causing her to be a real hooligan.
102200	104200	No, I'm not.
104200	106200	Oh, now I made you sad.
106200	107200	Okay.
107200	108200	Well, it's good.
108200	109200	I need to be able to make you sad.
109240	111240	That's the threat of a hooligan.
111240	113240	Okay, good.
113240	116240	That's the only difference between a...
116240	118240	Christina, have you been here to Harmon Town before?
118240	121240	And like, I'm from Las Vegas, so this is a big deal.
121240	123240	You're from Las Vegas, so this is a big deal.
123240	127240	Being in the back room at a comic book store.
127240	130240	Yeah, it's like being in Paris or Rome.
130240	135240	You come from a city where the Addams family has their own slap machine.
135240	138240	Why do you care that you're here?
138280	141280	I'm from Jeff Harmon and Jeff Davis.
141280	142280	It's a big deal.
142280	145280	Do you have any expectations or hopes or dreams tonight?
145280	146280	Not at all.
146280	147280	I mean, nothing?
147280	149280	What would be your dream...
149280	152280	If you could wake up tomorrow morning and you...
152280	153280	Why am I in such a good mood?
153280	155280	Oh, because that happened.
155280	159280	What would be the thing that you would hope to come out of the show tonight?
159280	160280	Just to be here. It's fine.
160280	162280	Don't put me on the spot.
162280	163280	Okay.
163280	166280	Don't put me on the spot, assholes, you just said.
166280	167280	All right.
167320	168320	Okay.
168320	170320	The gauntlet has been thrown.
170320	171320	All right.
172320	173320	No.
173320	175320	We're coming back to you, Christina.
175320	176320	Mars.
176320	177320	Mars.
177320	178320	Mars.
180320	182320	So Curiosity has landed.
184320	186320	And they're not going digging, by the way.
186320	190320	The thing in the front is not a big scooper on the Curiosity rover on Mars.
190320	193320	They got a laser on it that's going to evaporate rocks from a distance
193320	196320	and they're going to analyze rocks for the laser.
196360	198360	Oh, you know who was just telling me about that?
198360	201360	Six-year-old Gil, whose podcast I did upstairs.
201360	203360	The owner of the place has a six-year-old starter who has a podcast.
203360	205360	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
205360	206360	Whoa, whoa.
206360	208360	How many podcasts do you have, man?
208360	210360	No, it's his podcast, Gil.
210360	211360	Are you cheating on me?
211360	212360	No, no.
212360	214360	I was on another person's podcast.
214360	215360	I do that sometimes.
215360	217360	The theme tonight is infidelity, by the way.
217360	220360	Ah, very nice, Jeff.
220360	221360	Yes.
221360	224360	When will you learn that I will control the shit out of this motherfucker?
224360	225360	Thank you, Jeff.
225400	226400	I misinterpreted.
226400	227400	I thought that was a non-sequitur.
227400	230400	I thought you were misunderstanding, but actually what happened there
230400	232400	is Jeff was segwaying into our theme for tonight,
232400	235400	which I allowed the audience in line to choose.
235400	239400	I gave them the choice between travel, finance, and infidelity.
242400	244400	And, you know, predictably enough,
244400	246400	I should have thrown boobs in there,
246400	250400	which was on the master list because then we'd be talking about boobs all night.
250400	252400	But I figure we'll be talking about boobs regardless.
252440	256440	If the theme was travel, we're going to end up talking about my hemorrhoids.
256440	259440	Our last show, I've got to say,
259440	261440	if we can read the minutes from the last show.
261440	263440	I listened to a recording of it.
263440	267440	It was based solely around the butthole, I believe.
267440	269440	It was a complete...
269440	273440	At a certain point, we just started talking about things in butts.
273440	277440	I talked about how I once put a Sharpie pen in my butt.
277440	281440	I talked about how I had a real doll at one point
281480	285480	and Jeff talked about how he put on fishnets once
285480	289480	and, yeah, see, he can't fail.
291480	294480	I fuck a mannequin and I'm a pariah.
294480	297480	Jeff's a transvestite and all the women are throwing their panties up
297480	299480	for him to put on.
300480	302480	I'm a sweet transvestite.
302480	303480	That's my secret.
303480	305480	Rob Shrob came up and told us about...
305480	306480	What do we...
306480	310480	Yeah, Rob Shrob told a story about scalding his own butt with hot water.
310520	312520	It just turned into a theme.
312520	315520	So I was thinking that infidelity would be like a...
315520	318520	Probably, I would rather do travel or finance,
318520	321520	but then pink hair started shrieking.
321520	323520	No! You don't want to do that!
325520	327520	Anyways, there was a whole thing in line.
327520	331520	The crowd, the hooligans chose infidelity as a theme.
331520	333520	We got questions from you.
333520	335520	Jeff will comptroll those.
335520	337520	I haven't read them.
337520	338520	We'll pop over to them.
338520	339520	Why don't we give them a taste?
339560	341560	Do you want to crack one off right off the bat?
341560	342560	Sure, why not?
342560	343560	Alright.
343560	347560	Just from the top of the pile here, out of my right suit pocket.
347560	351560	If Troy ever cheated on Abed, who would it be with?
351560	352560	Community question.
352560	353560	Yeah.
360560	364560	I mean, well, obviously it would be Britta.
364560	365560	I mean, I can't...
365560	367560	Do I have to think of a funny answer?
367600	368600	Oh.
368600	370600	Well, Troy's in love with Britta.
370600	371600	Of course he did.
371600	372600	Yeah, I know.
372600	374600	We're talking to a guy who's show broke up with him
374600	377600	and started fucking another show runner.
377600	379600	Well, who do you think Troy's in love with?
379600	381600	Do you guys watch the show?
381600	383600	How clear did I have to...
383600	385600	That wasn't a secret.
385600	387600	I'm not Damon Lindelof.
387600	391600	You didn't have to watch the episodes backwards
391600	394600	and freeze frame on the shot of his driver's license
394640	399640	and run it through the da Vinci matrix.
403640	406640	He just seemed to have a big crush on Britta, it seemed.
406640	409640	Anyways, let's not talk about that.
409640	412640	Let's get over that relationship, shall we?
414640	418640	So, alright, that was an example of a question about infidelity.
420640	422640	I mean, how deep do you want to dig on the first one?
422640	423640	Do you want to start off light?
423680	424680	Or do you want to go for the heavy stuff?
424680	426680	We're not talking to you, pink hair.
427680	428680	Holy shit.
428680	431680	You can't go back and forth between being rambunctious
431680	434680	and then going, I'm sorry, don't pick on me.
434680	436680	We're going to start picking on you.
436680	439680	You've got to keep it down to...
441680	442680	...feel the people around you.
442680	444680	You're sitting right next to Enty.
444680	446680	He's like a star here.
446680	448680	Enty did a...
448680	450680	He doesn't have the right to get all...
450720	453720	He would be playing into a stereotype if he started yelling.
456720	459720	For podcast people, he's talking about a black gentleman this time.
460720	463720	You might remember him from one of our numerous podcasts...
463720	464720	About race.
467720	471720	Episodes 3 through 8, which the theme ended up being race.
471720	473720	Enty, you weren't here last time, were you?
473720	476720	Yeah, we thought we had really committed a crime.
476720	477720	We had done something terrible.
477760	480760	Enty's like the last Native American.
480760	481760	You don't want to...
481760	484760	If he goes away, we littered too much.
486760	489760	We're comforted by his presence.
490760	492760	We're hanging on to that bow.
492760	494760	What blows my mind is that you continue...
494760	497760	You seem like a very nice, mild-mannered dude.
497760	500760	You still sit right in the front row every time.
500760	502760	It's like the splash zone.
502760	503760	He loves it.
503760	505760	He's an aspiring writer, right, Enty?
505760	506760	You want to be a writer?
506800	507800	I don't know.
507800	509800	Maybe that's offensive.
509800	511800	Maybe you are a writer.
511800	513800	I think you want to be a writer.
513800	514800	Okay.
514800	515800	I don't know.
515800	518800	Maybe he wrote a fucking thing for his school paper.
518800	520800	He's going to go home and cut himself.
520800	524800	He didn't acknowledge my poetry series.
524800	527800	Enty, heart, full, soul.
532800	535800	I have a question for Pink Hair Lady real quick.
535840	538840	Do you live in the 714 area code?
538840	540840	No, I live in 702.
540840	542840	Okay, because someone here just wrote down,
542840	544840	call me, and it's a phone number.
544840	546840	And there's pink lipstick all over it.
546840	548840	Oh, yeah.
550840	552840	Someone shut their hand up.
552840	553840	Who was it?
553840	554840	All right.
554840	555840	All right.
555840	556840	I hope...
556840	560840	That's not your boyfriend that you came here with, right?
560840	561840	You're not doing this to him?
561840	562840	Okay.
562840	563840	All right.
563840	564840	Well, tonight is weird.
564880	569880	Should we just go get Jeffrey Ross, bring him up here?
569880	573880	It feels like a toxic, ugly night.
575880	577880	Is why I asked that question.
579880	581880	No, it's going to be fine.
581880	583880	Harman Town should be a safe place.
583880	587880	The original conceit is I need to start a colony somewhere
587880	589880	where we can all be cool to one another.
589880	593880	And, you know, I have some issues that I would bring
593920	594920	to bear immediately.
594920	596920	Like, you can have your shoes untied,
596920	598920	and no one can say your shoes are untied,
598920	600920	unless they really mean it well,
600920	602920	instead of just saying your shoes are untied
602920	604920	just to assert themselves over you,
604920	606920	which is what I'm convinced people do when they say
606920	607920	your shoes are untied.
607920	609920	But I've said to you, and I've heard people say to you
609920	612920	that your shoes were untied in the nicest possible tone,
612920	614920	and you still took great umbrage.
614920	616920	They still mean it.
616920	618920	Can I tell you a story about me taking umbrage
618920	620920	that happened outside?
620920	622920	Oh, all right, yeah.
622960	624960	Time for a Dan's umbrage corner.
627960	631960	My wonderful girlfriend, Erin McGathey,
631960	636960	and I went to a party, a rooftop party,
636960	638960	that every year I think Sarah Silverman
638960	640960	has this rooftop party.
640960	644960	And the stars come out in all of their constellations.
644960	648960	I met Chris Bosh, and then I googled him
648960	650960	and figured out who he was.
651000	655000	I met Das Racist, and I googled them
655000	657000	and figured out who they were.
657000	659000	I met Jack Black, and he was like,
659000	661000	hey, Das Racist is here.
661000	665000	I met Gary Shandling and talked to him
665000	668000	for like eight minutes about television.
668000	670000	He did all the talking, which was fine.
670000	673000	I never even told him that I had anything to do with TV.
673000	675000	I wanted to hear Gary Shandling talk about TV.
675000	679000	For you youngsters, I know you know Larry Sanders
679040	681040	the same way you know Mr. Show,
681040	684040	because you're the way I had to know Python.
684040	688040	But do you know it's Gary Shandling's show on Showtime?
688040	690040	That's important to go buy the box set of.
690040	692040	Maybe you don't have to sit through all of it.
692040	696040	It's 1980s comedy, but the concept was amazing.
696040	699040	Gary Shandling has always been a pioneer
699040	703040	of what, for lack of a better word,
703040	705040	and I truly wish there was no lack of a better word,
705080	708080	meta entertainment.
708080	711080	He's always been a defender of the creative's right
711080	714080	to use the frame as part of the painting.
714080	720080	He talked for a little bit about the thing.
720080	723080	As we were going into that party,
723080	729080	we pulled up to the building and we were walking in
729080	733080	and a guy said, are you here for Miss Silverman's party?
733120	736120	And we said yes, and he said, it's on the roof.
736120	738120	Go in the elevators on the left, straight up.
738120	740120	I don't know what accent that is,
740120	742120	but I know he had one.
742120	743120	That was Turkestan.
743120	745120	Turkestan.
745120	747120	Then as we were opening the door,
747120	749120	we just hear this voice.
749120	752120	This guy goes, the party's over.
752120	755120	And I went like, oh, what?
755120	757120	And looked over at the guy who said it.
757120	760120	And it was just a guy sitting on a bench.
760160	764160	And he was sitting with a woman that was,
764160	767160	and I was like, oh, whoa, whoa, what is it?
767160	768160	And he immediately smiled.
768160	772160	I was like, I'm just kidding.
772160	774160	And then we went in and went in the elevator.
774160	776160	And now in the elevator, I went,
776160	779160	that guy's a fucking lame ass.
779160	782160	Certainly his joke was lame.
782160	787160	And Aaron was like, well, now he's just trying to be a comrade.
787160	788160	Whatever.
788200	791200	He's as nervous as you are to be outside a party.
791200	792200	He's trying to be funny.
792200	793200	Whatever.
793200	796200	Good old Joan of Arc Aaron.
796200	801200	Tied to the fucking stake of being cool to everybody.
801200	802200	I hated him.
802200	804200	I thought he was a dick.
804200	806200	Like that's a dumb joke to make.
806200	807200	If your joke is that you're a dick,
807200	809200	that's a dick's joke.
809200	812200	You may be pretending to be a dick,
812200	813200	but that's what a dick does.
813200	814200	If that's always your joke,
814200	816200	I mean, that's often my joke.
816240	820240	So we go to the party.
820240	822240	Look, I'm not up here to have a breakthrough.
822240	826240	I'm up here to be right.
826240	829240	I'm up here to win an argument with my girlfriend
829240	832240	because I have lights and a microphone on me.
832240	837240	However, if you were, it would go a little something.
837240	839240	We left the party.
839240	843240	And then we go to the valet where our car is parked.
843240	845240	And the valet takes my ticket.
845280	848280	And he says, which car is yours?
848280	850280	And I said, it's a silver Prius.
850280	855280	And then as he's walking away, I go,
855280	858280	well, that actually may be presumptuous.
858280	860280	Call it a gray Prius.
866280	869280	And Aaron proceeds to, she's like,
869280	874280	see, you're as lame as that guy outside the party.
874320	879320	And I was like, no, because my joke is that I'm lame.
879320	881320	His joke is that we're lame.
881320	883320	He was like taking high status,
883320	885320	and I was taking low status.
885320	887320	I was doing like a dumb joke.
887320	890320	I'm just being funny and drunk.
890320	891320	And that guy is like...
891320	893320	He's saying that it was presumptuous
893320	894320	as taking low status?
894320	897320	Well, yeah, but I was being ironic.
897320	901320	I was being Gary Shandling about how...
901320	903320	Was the guy on the bench Gary Shandling?
903360	905360	No.
907360	910360	And then we got in a big fight.
910360	912360	And how did that go?
912360	916360	Well, it was her sticking up for a stranger on a bench
916360	918360	all night.
918360	922360	And me going, no, my silver Prius joke was awesome.
924360	926360	It was. It was funny.
926360	928360	She's a silver Prius.
928400	934400	I don't want to overstep Gray Prius.
934400	937400	It's funny, you know.
937400	941400	Because silver is a color, but it also denotes value.
941400	943400	And you thought that landed?
943400	945400	Well, I didn't think it landed.
947400	949400	I didn't think it landed.
949400	951400	You thought that undid all the wrongs
951400	953400	that the guy on the bench had to...
953400	955400	Why don't you change your name to Erin?
955400	957400	Because this is the conversation we had.
957440	961440	It's not my joke, unlike the good party's over guy.
961440	963440	My joke doesn't have to land.
963440	966440	I'm not holding anyone hostage with my joke.
966440	968440	I'm talking to the back of a valet's head.
968440	970440	I don't care if he's deaf.
970440	972440	It's still a funny joke to me.
972440	974440	And it doesn't matter.
974440	976440	It doesn't have to turn around and go, huh?
976440	978440	And me going, just kidding about my Prius.
982440	984440	This guy is...
984480	986480	It's comedic Al-Qaeda to go like...
986480	988480	Party's over.
988480	990480	What? The party's over?
990480	992480	No, it's not.
992480	994480	That's six-year-old humor.
994480	996480	I've known you long enough to know
996480	998480	that when your shoe's untied, you can't even say it.
998480	1003480	Like, hey, Dan, we're going into a kind of a dirty restaurant
1003480	1005480	with the florist's dirty, you might want to tie those shoes.
1005480	1007480	Like, there's no way to say that to you
1007480	1009480	without you taking offense.
1009480	1012480	Nobody ever says you're going into a dirty restaurant.
1012520	1015520	Everyone just goes, shoes untied, bro.
1015520	1017520	But I go, hey, Dan.
1017520	1019520	Fucking shoes untied.
1019520	1021520	My shoes aren't untied.
1021520	1023520	Party's over, formula.
1023520	1027520	If I say that, I don't think I'm trying to zin you.
1027520	1030520	I think I'm saying, like, should that be a concern to you?
1030520	1032520	Maybe you don't notice that.
1032520	1035520	I've learned now to never give two shits about your shoelaces
1035520	1036520	because I'm punished.
1036520	1038520	And I've learned to buy shoes without laces.
1038520	1040520	This is a rare night for me.
1040560	1043560	I'm wearing a fine pair of Adidas.
1043560	1045560	Yes, Adidas.
1045560	1047560	As always, Harmon Town, brought to you
1047560	1050560	by the good people at Adidas.
1050560	1053560	Why give your foot a handshake when you can give it a hug?
1053560	1055560	Yes, Adidas.
1055560	1060560	The A is for after glow.
1060560	1065560	Have sex with your foot by slipping a warm Adidas shoe on it.
1065560	1067560	Nike.
1067600	1071600	Do you think that this is ever going to pay off
1071600	1073600	that Nike's going to really feel the pressure?
1073600	1075600	I can't stop now.
1075600	1077600	What if we give up?
1077600	1080600	Gentlemen, I've just seen a spike in sales over Adidas
1080600	1082600	and it can only be attributed to one thing.
1082600	1084600	That's what we have to hope for.
1084600	1086600	This aggressive gorilla campaign over at Harmon Town.
1086600	1088600	Strong arm us.
1088600	1090600	I say no way.
1090600	1092600	I am the chief financial officer.
1092600	1094600	I say no.
1094640	1098640	And then an old man comes in and we're in a wheelchair
1098640	1102640	and he goes, I think we're going about this all wrong, gentlemen.
1102640	1105640	Give them whatever they want.
1105640	1109640	I remember when you were a gorilla, Richard.
1109640	1112640	That's different, Mr. Jenkins.
1113640	1116640	I would like to think maybe four months time
1116640	1118640	instead of this Harmon Town poster back here,
1118640	1121640	just a huge Nike swoosh back here.
1121640	1123640	I'm telling you, yeah, hey, Nike.
1123680	1125680	Living well is the best revenge.
1125680	1127680	Fucking buy me out.
1127680	1129680	And the next Harmon Town can be about
1129680	1132680	how much I love sucking Nike's dick.
1132680	1134680	I'll have no choice.
1134680	1136680	You'll have me on the hook.
1136680	1138680	I think the first step though is we actually have to
1138680	1141680	it has to become evident that we've made Adidas a dollar.
1141680	1144680	Yeah, well, I believe that will become evident.
1144680	1146680	Don't worry about that, Jeff.
1146680	1148680	Don't become one of them.
1148680	1150680	Just be a creative and advertise for Adidas
1150680	1152680	and let's see if we can reverse this.
1152720	1155720	I'm not your valet guy you can just yell shit at.
1157720	1159720	I don't know.
1159720	1161720	What was the outcome of the fight?
1161720	1163720	Did you guys find any closure to that?
1163720	1165720	Relationship better than ever.
1165720	1167720	Sealed it all up.
1167720	1168720	All the holes are plugged.
1168720	1170720	I don't know.
1170720	1172720	We agreed that we were both drunk
1172720	1174720	and having an argument about a stupid thing.
1174720	1176720	That's how it ended.
1176720	1178720	Do you guys ever argue about important shit?
1178720	1179720	No.
1179720	1181720	Like the Holocaust?
1181760	1183760	Like six million people?
1183760	1185760	Come on, give me the remote.
1188760	1190760	No, we never argue about important things.
1190760	1192760	We're both narcissistic assholes.
1192760	1194760	We don't care about the polar ice caps.
1194760	1196760	We care about ourselves and each other.
1196760	1198760	So that's what we fight about.
1198760	1202760	We fight because we worry that we don't love each other
1202760	1205760	as much as the other person loves us.
1205760	1207760	Those are the good fights.
1207760	1208760	The love fights.
1208760	1210760	You know, Eagles, they make love in mid-air.
1210800	1215800	And they spiral to the floor.
1215800	1218800	You're moved to words?
1218800	1220800	Yeah.
1220800	1222800	What were you saying?
1222800	1224800	He got overcome.
1224800	1226800	They're dying on the way down, you say?
1226800	1228800	The phonies.
1228800	1230800	The fucking death water fucking.
1230800	1232800	I'm a beautiful woman.
1232800	1234800	So you like it.
1234800	1237800	So you're saying the same thing the guy with the microphone is saying.
1237800	1239800	Just from the audience.
1239840	1244840	Have you met pink hair?
1244840	1247840	Don't have children.
1247840	1251840	Some of us have work to do.
1251840	1253840	Yes, Adam.
1253840	1255840	Now Adam's raising his hand.
1255840	1257840	I got the guy in the back doing the Mars callback.
1257840	1259840	This is fucking chaos.
1259840	1261840	I accept it.
1261840	1262840	Yes, Adam.
1262840	1264840	Just saying if they have sex, they'll plummet to their deaths.
1264840	1266840	If they have sex, they'll plummet to their deaths.
1266840	1268840	Asperger's Adam connected the dots.
1268880	1272880	We have a whole cavalcade of fucking peanuts here.
1272880	1276880	The only thing that happened is that sometimes people get so overcome by what you've said.
1276880	1278880	They're moved to agree.
1278880	1280880	They're moved to cry out.
1280880	1284880	I think sometimes your story's shoe is untied.
1284880	1288880	They want to call it your attention.
1288880	1290880	You take umbrage.
1290880	1292880	No.
1292880	1294880	This is a tragic misunderstanding because he was saying the same thing I was.
1294920	1296920	But when I hear somebody talking...
1296920	1298920	Yeah, you thought he was yelling at you.
1298920	1300920	Yeah, exactly.
1300920	1302920	You were just being supportive.
1302920	1304920	Now you really made him feel like a dick.
1304920	1306920	So you're saying that when people see your shoes untied, they're saying I love you.
1306920	1308920	They're trying to help.
1308920	1310920	They're worried about your shoe.
1310920	1312920	I think that's their retroactive defense.
1312920	1314920	I think that if someone says,
1314920	1316920	shoes untied brah, and you go, don't tell me what to do.
1316920	1318920	Get out of my life.
1318920	1320920	Tend your own garden, motherfucker.
1320920	1322920	Back off.
1322960	1324960	Then they go,
1324960	1326960	you could trip.
1326960	1328960	That was your first impulse.
1328960	1330960	You walk around wondering when I'm going to trip.
1330960	1332960	Some people do, man.
1332960	1334960	Not people who go, shoes untied brah.
1334960	1336960	Not that guy.
1336960	1338960	But I don't say it like that. I say your fucking shoes untied.
1338960	1340960	You never told me my shoes untied.
1340960	1342960	You're a liar.
1342960	1345960	Two nights ago at a wedding, we're getting ready for a wedding.
1345960	1347960	Dan Harmon came down in a nice suit.
1347960	1349960	He's got a suit on, looks good in it.
1349960	1351960	Dan's lost some weight, he's all fit.
1352000	1354000	He looks great.
1354000	1358000	But the motherfucker can't tie a tie very well.
1358000	1360000	You came down with a sloppy Harmon knot.
1360000	1362000	And I thought,
1362000	1365000	and boy, if you think your shoes untied,
1365000	1367000	I have more opinions about ties than shoes.
1367000	1370000	Because the tie is right up there by your face.
1370000	1372000	And I was like,
1372000	1374000	let's work on that tie.
1374000	1377000	For some reason, there was a giant,
1377000	1379000	giant full length mirror.
1379040	1383040	From my fashion show for Erin to Sade.
1383040	1386040	Alright, call back.
1386040	1388040	So there's a giant full length mirror down there.
1388040	1390040	And I say, Dan, I would never do this.
1390040	1392040	Because I know that you're not rewarded for telling Dan
1392040	1394040	that anything is tied wrong.
1394040	1396040	He hasn't the thing about that.
1396040	1398040	And so I go, we've got to fix that tie.
1398040	1400040	You're like, what's wrong with my tie?
1400040	1402040	And I was like, I'm going to show you something.
1402040	1404040	So I reach around and like,
1404040	1406040	grandpa before the wedding.
1406040	1408040	And I'm tying the tie.
1408040	1410040	And Erin's taking a picture of it.
1410040	1412040	And you know that's going to be Instagrammed in a moment.
1412040	1414040	And you had the saddest look on your face.
1414040	1416040	The whole tag was so bummed out.
1416040	1418040	Because I know it's going to be Instagrammed.
1418040	1420040	And it's like, I've been tying a tie since I was 12 years old.
1420040	1422040	Yeah, but you tie it like shit?
1422040	1424040	No, I've got it down to a science.
1424040	1426040	I do it very quickly.
1426040	1428040	But it looks bad.
1428040	1430040	The difference between it looking bad
1430040	1432040	and looking good is how much
1432040	1434040	money and power I achieve.
1434040	1436040	Okay, now we're getting somewhere.
1436040	1438040	Yeah, if I put a shoe on my head
1438040	1440040	and I'm president,
1440040	1442040	everyone has to put a shoe on their head.
1442040	1445040	We're monkeys. We're not fucking giraffes.
1445040	1447040	I'm just saying, you look better with a...
1452040	1454040	What's your beef against giraffes?
1454040	1456040	Well, they have long necks.
1456040	1458040	I mean, they're obviously willing to change
1458040	1460040	for how high the leaf is.
1463040	1465040	I think because they had more neck,
1465040	1467040	they were more concerned about ties.
1468040	1470040	When did I become the crazy comic relief guy
1470040	1472040	in my own show?
1472040	1475040	Why am I the Jamie Farrer of this mash?
1478040	1480040	There was a show in the 70s coming.
1481040	1483040	Can we get back on track, please?
1483040	1486040	I try to keep an orderly show going here.
1486040	1488040	Sometimes we get off on tangents.
1488040	1490040	It's a rare thing, but...
1490040	1492040	Normally this thing is a well-oiled machine.
1492040	1494040	We pick a topic, we stick to it.
1494040	1496040	Tonight's topic is infidelity.
1496040	1498040	All right, I'm going to ask another question
1498040	1499040	from the audience here, Dan.
1499040	1501040	Somebody writes,
1501040	1504040	do you think anyone with a list of celebrities
1504040	1506040	they're allowed to cheat on with
1506040	1508040	has ever been able to cross one off?
1512040	1515040	I get distracted by the concept of that before
1515040	1518040	because it felt like that whole hall pass,
1518040	1520040	whatever you call it, celebrity pass thing.
1520040	1522040	So douchey.
1523040	1525040	It really flies in the face of my whole,
1525040	1528040	you know, like the idea that it's like,
1528040	1531040	well, I'm fucking you, but...
1531040	1534040	We both agree if Paris Hilton walked in, right?
1536040	1538040	It's so fucking disgusting.
1538040	1540040	I wonder how divorce rate is 70%.
1540040	1542040	I'm more concerned about the voice
1542040	1544040	that you give every other person in your life.
1545040	1547040	Shoot the tab, bro.
1547040	1550040	Everyone in the world is supposed to slow.
1550040	1551040	I don't know.
1551040	1553040	They're all like, I perceive them as trying to...
1553040	1556040	Well, you know, who came up with that?
1556040	1557040	All right, how about this?
1557040	1559040	Is there a scenario
1559040	1561040	where your significant other cheats
1561040	1564040	that you'd totally forgive them for,
1564040	1567040	does that scenario exist for you?
1568040	1571040	Well, uh...
1571040	1573040	Go big.
1575040	1577040	Yeah.
1577040	1579040	Um, I mean, there's obvious...
1579040	1580040	I mean, there's top of the line...
1580040	1582040	Shit, should we have her leave the room?
1582040	1584040	Where anyone would cheat.
1584040	1586040	Where, like, if...
1586040	1587040	Okay.
1587040	1589040	If there was an alien virus...
1593040	1595040	No, no, no, Dan, I said go big.
1596040	1598040	There's an alien virus released on Earth,
1598040	1601040	and then, like, it dropped in, like, these orbs
1601040	1603040	that created big explosions, so there was chaos.
1603040	1606040	And then the virus got aerosol-misted into the air,
1606040	1608040	so the primary effect is the destruction
1608040	1610040	of our infrastructure, and then,
1610040	1612040	while that plunged us into chaos,
1612040	1615040	which would separate me from my girlfriend,
1615040	1617040	then the virus is released into the air,
1617040	1620040	which threatens the survival of the human race.
1620040	1624040	She meets a scientist, let's say, played by Bill Pullman.
1624040	1626040	I'm...
1627040	1629040	While separated from me.
1629040	1632040	She's the only non-sterilized human being in some bunker.
1632040	1634040	He's the only non-sterilized man.
1634040	1636040	I mean, and for some reason,
1636040	1638040	they can't just put his sperm in a cup,
1638040	1640040	and, you know, like, they really have to do it
1640040	1644040	on the floor of the Library of Congress or something.
1646040	1649040	Then the movie's over, we beat all the aliens,
1649040	1651040	and I walk across the Salt Lake Flats toward her,
1651040	1653040	and she's got a cigar in her mouth,
1653040	1656040	and, you know, we did it.
1656040	1658040	We saved the Earth.
1658040	1660040	You know, she goes, like, we did it.
1660040	1662040	I'm like, oh, my God, I'm alive. You're alive.
1662040	1663040	Oh, and she whispers at me,
1663040	1666040	I had to fuck Bill Pullman.
1666040	1669040	I go, like, I would have, too.
1669040	1671040	I'm going to be okay with that.
1671040	1673040	But anything really smaller-scale than that,
1673040	1676040	I'd be like, whore!
1677040	1680040	You belong to me!
1680040	1684040	I think that you might just have enough pettiness in your body
1684040	1686040	to still, like, three days later at Little Dom's,
1686040	1687040	have a breakfast.
1687040	1690040	She'd be like, this crepe's really good.
1690040	1691040	Yeah?
1691040	1694040	Does it remind you of Bill Pullman's dick?
1694040	1695040	Is it better or worse?
1695040	1697040	I'm making a scrapbook.
1697040	1700040	Honey, honey, we wouldn't have crepes anymore
1700040	1701040	if I didn't fuck Bill Pullman.
1701040	1704040	Yeah, no, no, I understood, understood.
1704040	1707040	I'm sure you hated it.
1707040	1710040	He was pretty good. He was pretty good in films.
1710040	1713040	Thanks, baby.
1713040	1716040	And then Paris Hilton walks in,
1716040	1718040	and that's my celebrity pass,
1718040	1722040	which is the conceit of my new movies.
1722040	1726040	Yeah, whatever, man. I don't know.
1726040	1730040	I didn't want the theme to be infidelity tonight
1730040	1731040	because the topic makes me...
1731040	1735040	I don't like watching movies where the central conceit
1735040	1738040	is like this scandalous taboo,
1738040	1742040	like coming up with ways to make it okay for people to cheat.
1742040	1744040	Like, it always makes me very uncomfortable.
1744040	1745040	I got cheated on once,
1745040	1750040	and I'm a very jealous person, very, very insecure,
1750040	1753040	very possessive, very, very like...
1753040	1758040	I don't want to be better about it
1758040	1761040	because I don't want to have big, thick calluses
1761040	1764040	over the part of my body that feels pain
1764040	1766040	when my girlfriend wants to fuck someone else.
1766040	1770040	I want my girlfriend not to fuck other people.
1770040	1772040	I want true love.
1772040	1778040	I guess it's immature, but it bugs me.
1778040	1780040	You see these Richard Gere movies,
1780040	1784040	and he trained parrots,
1784040	1788040	and he was married to her in 1800s England,
1788040	1790040	but then she went into a coma,
1790040	1795040	and then he met the parrot owner of his dreams.
1795040	1798040	She was in a coma, so we couldn't break up with her.
1798040	1801040	We just had to fuck her on top of her,
1801040	1803040	and it's like you're supposed to tune in,
1803040	1806040	and you're really just jacking off to a man and woman
1806040	1808040	fucking on top of his wife.
1808040	1816040	How come you don't write more features?
1816040	1819040	Now, but Dan, you said in previous podcasts,
1819040	1823040	or Harman Towns, rather, that when you are masturbating,
1823040	1825040	you fantasize about your person,
1825040	1828040	you're a girlfriend fucking somebody else.
1828040	1831040	Not my girlfriend, necessarily.
1831040	1834040	More often than not, that's when I'm single,
1834040	1837040	between relationships, when I'm very lonely,
1837040	1839040	when I'm masturbating.
1839040	1841040	The fantasy that creeps into my head the most often
1841040	1848040	is my ex-girlfriend fucking other people.
1848040	1850040	But never your current girlfriend.
1850040	1851040	What's up?
1851040	1852040	But never your current girlfriend.
1852040	1853040	Sometimes.
1854040	1858040	Sometimes my current girlfriend, but that's more like a,
1858040	1861040	yes, sometimes.
1861040	1864040	I'll think of weird raunchy situations
1864040	1869040	where the girlfriend that I'm currently with
1869040	1875040	is an insatiable kind of animal, and I'm not around.
1875040	1879040	It starts with self-loathing, because like I said,
1879040	1882040	I can't put myself in a sexual situation very easily.
1882040	1883040	It's easier.
1883040	1886040	The path of least resistance is for me to not be there,
1886040	1892040	if it's really sexy, because I look like Randy Quaid.
1892040	1895040	And you don't cast him in nine and a half weeks.
1895040	1904040	You put him in vacation three, and not even in the lead role.
1904040	1908040	And that leads to like, well, if my girlfriend is fucking
1908040	1910040	and I'm not there, then who is she fucking?
1910040	1912040	And then you go, well, maybe the guy's fixing the roof.
1912040	1914040	I don't know.
1914040	1915040	So sometimes, sometimes.
1915040	1921040	But that's like 15%, 20%.
1921040	1926040	But when I'm single and I've been dumped, it's like 100%.
1926040	1931040	Like I can't get my brain out of that gutter,
1931040	1935040	like where it's like, oh, my ex-girlfriend that dumped me.
1935040	1936040	She dumped me.
1936040	1938040	She's doing this, and she's doing that.
1938040	1939040	And I'm thinking about that.
1939040	1945040	So it's like my sexual wires are crossed with my self-hatred wires.
1945040	1946040	And it's terrible.
1946040	1947040	It's awful.
1947040	1950040	It's a picture of mental illness.
1950040	1956040	But saying it into a microphone makes it all better.
1956040	1959040	It makes everything perfect.
1959040	1962040	Nothing will ever go wrong now.
1963040	1970040	Thanks, everybody, tonight, by the way, for calling me out on everything.
1970040	1971040	What the fuck?
1971040	1973040	It's my show.
1973040	1975040	I think you seem a little extra on edge tonight.
1975040	1976040	No.
1976040	1979040	From the moment I came up here, I've been attacked.
1979040	1980040	I know.
1980040	1981040	You've perceived attack.
1981040	1983040	A guy in the front row was going like, yeah, I totally agree.
1983040	1986040	And you thought, like, you said, hey, shut the fuck up, man.
1986040	1988040	No, that's not true.
1988040	1991040	What's your name guy that looks exactly like Akiva Shafer?
1992040	1994040	What's your name?
1994040	1995040	Levi.
1995040	1996040	Levi?
1996040	1997040	Wait, wait, wait.
1997040	2001040	Well, don't do too much talking because when you're off mic, having heard the podcast recording
2001040	2002040	thing, okay, give him a mic.
2002040	2003040	Give him a mic.
2003040	2005040	What was the thing you just called me?
2005040	2007040	A guy that looks exactly like Akiva Shafer.
2007040	2008040	A friend of ours.
2008040	2010040	He's a writer and a very funny guy.
2010040	2012040	Don't know what I'm 25.
2012040	2013040	Should I know that?
2013040	2015040	He's 22.
2015040	2016040	Fuck you.
2016040	2018040	Is he here tonight?
2018040	2019040	Can I bite him?
2019040	2020040	Fuck him.
2020040	2021040	I'm like, what?
2021040	2022040	Should I know him?
2022040	2023040	See?
2023040	2024040	He's defensive too.
2024040	2025040	Yeah.
2025040	2026040	Because of you, though.
2026040	2027040	All right.
2027040	2028040	Well, can we do a thing?
2028040	2034040	Like, would you just tell me about the first, tell me about, I'm trying to think of like
2034040	2038040	an easy, like, tell me about your favorite Christmas.
2038040	2040040	No.
2040040	2041040	Okay.
2041040	2042040	All right.
2042040	2045040	You guys are meant for each other.
2045040	2046040	All right.
2046040	2049040	Well, tell me, what's your favorite TV show?
2049040	2050040	Or just a good one.
2050040	2051040	Just anyone.
2051040	2052040	It doesn't have to be your favorite.
2052040	2053040	You don't say that one.
2053040	2054040	Adam, shut up.
2054040	2055040	Don't heckle a double heckler.
2055040	2056040	It's a fucking inception of...
2056040	2064040	Do we get a double heckler?
2064040	2066040	It's like this biosphere is erupting.
2066040	2068040	It's like a fractal fucking flower pattern of people.
2068040	2070040	The hecklers are heckling the hecklers.
2070040	2072040	I'm not heckling at all.
2072040	2074040	No, no, no, no.
2074040	2078040	Levi, Adam, quiet.
2078040	2082040	Levi, tell me about a favorite show of yours.
2082040	2083040	Just Stranger With Candy.
2083040	2084040	Okay.
2084040	2088040	Just tell me, start talking about why it's good.
2088040	2091040	It's got Stephen Colbert before it goes on.
2091040	2093040	No, no, no, no.
2093040	2095040	It's Stephen Colbert.
2095040	2098040	That's what you thought happens?
2098040	2099040	Yeah.
2099040	2101040	That's exactly what happened.
2101040	2105040	I was saying, I was saying, eagles fuck as they're going to the thing.
2105040	2110040	I just heard like, oh, they're dying.
2110040	2117040	Dan, I have the best seat in the house because I can see you and Levi perfectly and he was
2117040	2120040	just like, fuck, yeah, they're dying out there.
2120040	2122040	It was on your side.
2122040	2123040	You had a comrade.
2123040	2127040	Yes, we found out he was on my side, but I'm telling you the customer is always right.
2127040	2129040	I'm a customer base of one.
2129040	2137040	If the guy behind the microphone thinks that someone is like a distraction, he's right.
2137040	2138040	I'm right.
2138040	2139040	I'm definitely right.
2139040	2140040	I'm a focus group.
2140040	2141040	Yeah, you're louder.
2141040	2143040	So yeah, that's how it works.
2143040	2145040	Now he's got a microphone.
2145040	2146040	No, it doesn't.
2146040	2147040	Now we're on even ground.
2147040	2148040	Yeah.
2148040	2149040	No, here's the thing.
2149040	2151040	Your name's going to my suicide note tonight, buddy.
2151040	2153040	You're like, now you're fucked.
2153040	2155040	So the audience doesn't, they don't like this.
2155040	2156040	They don't like the chaos.
2156040	2157040	They don't like the.
2158040	2159040	That's what's happening now.
2159040	2160040	That's the thing.
2160040	2161040	That's the thing.
2161040	2162040	All right.
2162040	2163040	Levi, keep the microphone.
2163040	2165040	Keep talking into it.
2165040	2166040	No, no, no, no, no.
2166040	2167040	No, no, because pink hair is about to grab the mic.
2167040	2168040	I'm taking that away.
2168040	2170040	I mean, it rolls downhill.
2170040	2173040	There's chaos and there's chaos.
2173040	2175040	This has nothing to do with power dynamics.
2175040	2179040	It has everything to do with intent and emotion and dynamics.
2179040	2183040	What I'm saying is not that I'm louder than you or that you're being too loud.
2183040	2188040	What I'm saying is that your way of expressing agreement to me with these
2188040	2191040	lights in my face looks an awful lot like a drowning man.
2193040	2195040	Everyone else does that.
2195040	2196040	What they just did.
2196040	2199040	You were, you went, he said I would do it.
2199040	2200040	It's Adam again.
2201040	2206040	And I thought it meant that your mother had been raped by an eagle and I wanted
2206040	2207040	to talk about it.
2207040	2210040	By the way, I didn't just point at your shirt and go, where'd you get it?
2210040	2211040	Ray Charles out of garage.
2211040	2212040	I'll go fuck yourself.
2212040	2213040	Faggot.
2213040	2214040	I didn't do anything.
2214040	2216040	I didn't bully you.
2216040	2218040	I said, what's going on down here?
2218040	2222040	The same way I did to that fucking asshole outside Sarah Silverman's party.
2222040	2223040	Yeah.
2223040	2224040	What's what do you mean?
2224040	2225040	Party's over.
2225040	2227040	How fuck you my shoes untied.
2227040	2229040	You got my full attention now.
2229040	2232040	My brain's the size of a fucking planet.
2232040	2235040	How much of it do you want?
2235040	2236040	You want it?
2236040	2237040	You want all of it?
2237040	2238040	I'll give you all of it.
2238040	2240040	You're not going to like it.
2241040	2245040	I'm thinking about a new TV show.
2245040	2247040	It's going to make everyone happy.
2247040	2248040	Party's over.
2248040	2249040	Eagles are dying.
2249040	2250040	Your shoes untied.
2250040	2253040	It's about aliens that drop pods of things.
2253040	2254040	That was good.
2254040	2255040	Remember what I came up with?
2255040	2256040	That's a good guy.
2256040	2259040	Hey, I want to think about your girlfriend sucking dicks.
2259040	2260040	Well, Bill Pullman's in it.
2260040	2263040	It's a fucking box office dynamite.
2263040	2265040	You see what's going on up here.
2265040	2268040	I deserve I deserve space.
2269040	2271040	I'll reward you for having it.
2271040	2272040	Right.
2272040	2273040	But not everybody is like.
2273040	2274040	Okay.
2274040	2276040	I have Asperger's.
2276040	2277040	Do you think so?
2277040	2278040	No.
2278040	2282040	I diagnosed myself with it after taking an online quiz.
2285040	2288040	And reading some conversations in a forum.
2289040	2292040	Was one of the symptoms you take online Asperger's quizzes?
2292040	2293040	Yeah.
2293040	2294040	Yeah.
2295040	2296040	I don't know.
2296040	2297040	I don't have an excuse.
2297040	2298040	I'm a person.
2298040	2300040	I'm a bad, unlikable person.
2300040	2303440	Would you be happier if you found out that you did have some sort of diagnosable illness
2303440	2304440	like Asperger's?
2304440	2305440	I don't know.
2305440	2308040	Well, like Aaron said, I'd rather it be one that's named after me.
2310040	2313040	Like I'd rather not have to have this Asperger guy on my shit.
2313040	2314040	Like that guy narcissist.
2314040	2315040	Yeah.
2315040	2316040	Yeah, exactly.
2316040	2323040	I'd like to have people after me call themselves Harman Burgers.
2324040	2329040	It's as if the word burger is part of the, I don't know.
2329040	2331040	Well, you guys are throwing me.
2331040	2332040	Congratulations.
2332040	2333040	I mean, that's what you get.
2333040	2334040	You crack, you cracked the walnut.
2334040	2338040	Now you get the, now you get the chewy neurotic nut in the middle.
2338040	2339040	Well, we got, oh shit.
2339040	2341040	We have to bring fucking Spencer up here.
2341040	2342040	No, no, no.
2343040	2347040	We have a real treat in store tonight by applause.
2347040	2352040	How many of you have never heard of or know nothing about Dungeons and Dragons?
2352040	2353040	My applause.
2354040	2355040	Sorry, wait.
2355040	2356040	No, no.
2356040	2357040	Either nobody's.
2357040	2358040	No, I heard silence.
2358040	2359040	I started laughing.
2359040	2361040	But then there was, sorry, go ahead.
2361040	2364040	Anybody who knows nothing about Dungeons and Dragons.
2364040	2366040	I'm one of those people.
2366040	2367040	All right.
2367040	2368040	All right.
2368040	2369040	So several, like six or seven or eight.
2369040	2370040	Yeah.
2370040	2374040	But I was just laughing because I'm very proud of my audience.
2374040	2375040	Yes.
2375040	2380040	We are indeed in the back room of a comic book star right now.
2380040	2385040	Three Harmon towns ago, Dan brought up the idea of possibly having a dungeon master
2385040	2388040	so we could play Dungeons and Dragons.
2388040	2391040	And there was a gentleman in our audience that night who could not have possibly known
2391040	2395040	that we were going to talk about that, who shot his hand in the air.
2395040	2399040	So then last week we brought him up again and we came up with characters.
2399040	2402040	Jeff decided that he wanted to be a gnome barbarian.
2402040	2403040	Correct.
2404040	2406040	I was trying to go out of character.
2406040	2409040	The audience picked the name of Quark.
2409040	2410040	Yeah.
2410040	2411040	Yeah.
2411040	2413040	That hat kind of fell down around my ears.
2413040	2415040	But I'm sticking with it.
2415040	2417040	I'm Quark.
2417040	2424040	And you and your audience picked the name Sharpie Butts a lot for me.
2424040	2425040	We can change them.
2425040	2426040	We can change those names.
2426040	2428040	Well, I don't think that's good.
2428040	2429040	We shot from the hip.
2429040	2431040	That's not good storytelling when you go back and change.
2431040	2435040	I mean, look, would I be happier with a name that wasn't Quark?
2435040	2436040	Yes.
2436040	2437040	The answer is yes.
2437040	2445040	But so more importantly, you picked a gnome barbarian and I picked a human magic user.
2445040	2447040	I'm first edition Dungeons and Dragons.
2447040	2452040	So Spencer had to email me subsequently and go, oh, by the way, it's not just magic user.
2452040	2454040	Now you have to pick between a wizard and a sorcerer.
2454040	2455040	I picked a wizard.
2455040	2457040	A wizard is somebody who studies it.
2457040	2459040	Adam, what are you doing?
2459040	2463040	I was mentioning how I wasn't going to correct you because in first edition gnomes can't
2463040	2465040	even be married.
2465040	2471040	I think if the show if Nike ever does give us any money, I want everyone in this audience
2471040	2474040	to have a lavalier mic on.
2474040	2476040	And the world's biggest soundboard.
2476040	2478040	Yeah, there definitely needs to be.
2478040	2479040	Yeah.
2479040	2482040	There's like like roving drones that can just like mic people.
2482040	2486040	Some of them nerd now we need to area mic this this audience more because there's too
2486040	2488040	much good shit happening.
2488040	2490040	Adam, how could you not think I heard you?
2490040	2493040	You're not watching Breaking Bad.
2493040	2495040	I'm two feet from you.
2495040	2496040	He's talking to.
2496040	2498040	He was trying to help Dan.
2498040	2505040	You're sticking up for just a fundamental vagrant.
2505040	2510040	I don't know much about being a barbarian dwarf, but I'm pretty sure he would stand up
2510040	2511040	for this guy.
2511040	2512040	All right.
2512040	2517040	Well, obviously since we're arguing about Dungeons and Dragons, which is ratings dynamite, let's
2517040	2521040	bring the star of this Walker, Texas Ranger show up Spencer.
2521040	2531040	Come on up here.
2531040	2537040	How's it going?
2537040	2541040	Thank you for coming back, Spencer, and thank you in advance for the work you've done since
2541040	2543040	Friday.
2543040	2545040	Do we have to start with this?
2545040	2547040	Did you hear what was going on down here?
2547040	2549040	Have you met Adam, by the way?
2549040	2550040	Yeah.
2550040	2552040	No, I haven't.
2552040	2555040	What?
2555040	2558040	Was that insincere to you?
2558040	2560040	I'm genuinely enthused.
2560040	2564040	Is there a weird force field up here where everybody feels like people are coming after
2564040	2565040	him?
2565040	2570040	No, there's just a lot of people coming after the people on stage.
2570040	2573040	Spencer and I are good people and on the same side, right?
2573040	2574040	Forever.
2574040	2577040	The fourth wall, good and early this night.
2577040	2578040	All right.
2578040	2579040	But no, seriously.
2579040	2582040	So Adam started immediately talking about some kind of...
2582040	2583040	What?
2583040	2584040	I'll just hold it like that.
2584040	2585040	It'll be better.
2585040	2587040	The Wanda voice amplification.
2587040	2590040	Jeff just did a bit where he tried to raise the microphone to Spencer's level.
2590040	2592040	Spencer's six foot four.
2592040	2593040	I'm tired.
2593040	2594040	You're tired of that.
2594040	2595040	How tall are you?
2595040	2596040	How tall are you?
2596040	2598040	We're going with six foot four, I think.
2598040	2602040	You tell me, bro, I stopped measuring myself.
2603040	2608040	There is a huge insecurity thing going on with that microphone.
2608040	2609040	There's a weird...
2609040	2611040	That's the most secure thing in the world.
2611040	2612040	Fuck rulers.
2612040	2613040	All right.
2613040	2614040	I'm tall.
2614040	2615040	That's all you need to know.
2615040	2617040	Yeah, at a certain point you stop caring, yeah.
2617040	2618040	Okay, I got you.
2618040	2619040	I like this guy.
2619040	2621040	Just don't give me that look when you say it.
2621040	2622040	Oh, I'm sorry.
2622040	2624040	I don't know, man.
2624040	2627040	So for real, I just...
2627040	2630040	Because really, Adam, what were you saying?
2630040	2632040	What was your thing about...
2632040	2633040	What were you saying?
2633040	2634040	Gnomes, barbarians?
2634040	2635040	What were you saying?
2635040	2636040	I've seen...
2636040	2637040	I'm sorry.
2637040	2641040	I was touching the microphone, which you're now holding and dispensing.
2641040	2643040	But in the first edition...
2643040	2645040	I've seen your D&D rule books.
2645040	2647040	I thought they're first edition and gnomes can't be barbarians.
2647040	2652040	But I thought, if I say that out loud, Dan's going to think I'm more aspergy than I think
2652040	2654040	he is am.
2654040	2657040	See, that's who the sentence is that proves itself.
2657040	2661040	So I was like, I'm just going to say that quietly to someone who might get it in context
2661040	2664040	and I still upset you for which I apologize.
2664040	2665040	All right, okay.
2665040	2667040	Well, all right.
2669040	2670040	I didn't know...
2670040	2671040	Did you...
2671040	2672040	He was saying...
2672040	2673040	Yeah, he has a fair point.
2673040	2675040	He was talking about first edition, is that correct?
2675040	2678040	Yeah, we're playing 3.5 editions, so it's not an issue.
2678040	2680040	But yeah, he is right.
2682040	2685040	I don't know what the fuck anybody's talking about.
2685040	2686040	Well, I don't either.
2686040	2688040	Let me just explain it for a long time.
2688040	2689040	Here we go.
2692040	2694040	This is getting off in the right foot.
2695040	2702040	Let's call our edition 3.6, which means that if there's an infraction, you don't have to yell out.
2702040	2705040	That's the difference between 3.5 and 3.6.
2706040	2707040	All right.
2708040	2715040	So if I say my wizard's wearing a pointy hat, you know, and you read an elf magazine that he can't...
2717040	2719040	Just, you know, don't run up on stage.
2719040	2721040	It's getting scary in this place.
2722040	2723040	I'm doing great.
2723040	2730040	It's just like Ford Apache the Bronx or Assault on Precinct 17.
2730040	2731040	Yeah.
2731040	2732040	Take it away, Spencer.
2732040	2736040	All right, well, as we've mentioned, you've picked a gnome barbarian, Jeff.
2738040	2739040	Oh, Adam's already here.
2741040	2742040	I'm a gnome barbarian.
2742040	2743040	All right.
2743040	2744040	Is that not good?
2744040	2745040	No, it's great.
2745040	2746040	It's fine.
2746040	2747040	I don't really know...
2747040	2750040	Briefly explain to me what that means.
2751040	2752040	A gnome is about...
2752040	2755040	Your gnome is about three foot, three inches tall.
2755040	2756040	And he angrily...
2756040	2757040	That's what she said.
2757040	2758040	You don't...
2758040	2759040	Sorry.
2759040	2760040	Sorry.
2760040	2761040	Sorry.
2761040	2763040	It's like a kickstand, I swear.
2764040	2769040	And he flies angrily at people with a sword a full foot longer than he is.
2769040	2770040	No shit?
2770040	2771040	Yeah.
2773040	2774040	All right.
2774040	2775040	We're back in business.
2776040	2777040	Sorry.
2777040	2778040	I'm three foot three.
2778040	2779040	I got a four foot three sword.
2779040	2781040	It's slanted.
2782040	2783040	That's what she said.
2788040	2789040	Should I stop saying that's what she said?
2789040	2790040	Is that going to happen a lot?
2790040	2794040	I think that happens eight times per game in Dungeons and Dragons, so...
2795040	2796040	All right.
2796040	2797040	Okay, so on a slow day...
2797040	2802040	I fly angrily at people with a sword a foot longer than my body.
2802040	2803040	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2803040	2804040	All right.
2805040	2806040	I wrote you a backstory.
2806040	2808040	Do you want to hear your backstory?
2808040	2809040	Fucking yes.
2809040	2810040	All right.
2810040	2812040	Well, let me just start it off.
2812040	2818040	Court stands tall for a gnome a full three foot three inches.
2818040	2822040	When he was growing up, he was picked on by the local hooligans who insulted his ragged clothes
2822040	2826040	and admittedly lackluster mental faculties on a regular basis.
2827040	2831040	That is until one day he snapped in a gnome on gnome scuffle,
2831040	2836040	biting the ear off the ringleader of the local gang, the cactus bunch,
2837040	2840040	after they had taken his prized bandana.
2841040	2843040	It was his first taste of blood.
2843040	2845040	It would not be his last.
2846040	2847040	All right.
2849040	2850040	I love that.
2850040	2851040	I love that a lot.
2852040	2855040	As much as I hate gnome on gnome violence, I still...
2856040	2857040	It's an epidemic.
2857040	2859040	When will it stop?
2859040	2861040	But that's hopefully at the Grammys.
2861040	2862040	I love that.
2863040	2868040	The thing is, as you said, Spencer, I have a perfect visual image of who that character is.
2868040	2869040	All right, great.
2870040	2872040	And so, yeah, he hit stuff with a sword.
2872040	2873040	That's about it, you know.
2874040	2875040	Yeah, wow, we'll get there.
2876040	2877040	Yeah, no, he gets better.
2877040	2881040	Is there still, as of 3.5, is it just a list of those attributes,
2881040	2883040	like strength, intelligence, wisdom, all that stuff?
2884040	2885040	Yeah, there's the class features.
2885040	2889040	Mostly it's attributes, feats, and skills, but yeah, there's some stuff.
2889040	2892040	I thought maybe you'd just read down Jeff's attributes, just the main ones.
2893040	2894040	Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.
2894040	2898040	He's got a strength, 16 out of how many?
2899040	2905040	Oh, um, 10 is considered average, like 18 is like the pinnacle of human achievement.
2906040	2907040	So 16 is...
2907040	2908040	Like giant monsters.
2908040	2910040	16 is well above average.
2910040	2911040	You'd be like a bodybuilder.
2911040	2912040	Thank you.
2912040	2913040	In the real world.
2914040	2920040	Dexterity is 14, which is above average, but not like super amazing.
2920040	2925040	Constitution is 17, which is really strong.
2925040	2928040	That's, you know, he can take a beating and keep on eating.
2928040	2929040	Also, he can...
2930040	2932040	And he can drink people under the table.
2933040	2934040	You got that right.
2935040	2940040	He's got a 12 intelligence, which is still kind of smart for someone who's a barbarian,
2940040	2944040	but he's got 11 wisdom, which means he has no common sense.
2945040	2949040	I gave him a 17 charisma because he's got a dashing smile and a winning sense of humor.
2950040	2952040	That's not you, that's just the character.
2956040	2957040	You're the boss, Spencer.
2957040	2958040	Thank you very much.
2958040	2959040	All right.
2959040	2961040	Moving on to Sharpie Butzalot.
2963040	2964040	All right.
2965040	2971040	Sharpie Butzalot is a tall, dark-haired wizard in what is unmistakably a periwinkle terrycloth bathrobe.
2974040	2979040	Sharpie was born to a maiden doomed to life imprisonment in the high tower of Penitence.
2979040	2983040	Life was hard growing up in a prison, but he started to read and learn magic at a young age.
2984040	2989040	He eventually cast Featherfall on himself and fell safely out of the tower and began adventuring.
2990040	2991040	Yeah.
2991040	2992040	All right.
2992040	2993040	First level.
2993040	2994040	That's as far as your story goes.
2994040	2995040	And we just started.
2995040	2996040	Yeah, you start to build the legend now.
2996040	3000040	And believe me, the name Sharpie Butzalot will be feared throughout the realm.
3003040	3004040	What about my attributes?
3004040	3005040	What do I got here?
3005040	3006040	All right.
3006040	3010040	You got a 9 strength, which is still decent for your average lay person.
3010040	3012040	I couldn't do a pull-up in grade school.
3012040	3014040	You might still be able to, yeah.
3015040	3018040	14 dexterity, which is the same as Jeff's.
3019040	3021040	What's his shoe-tying ability?
3022040	3025040	He's got three ranks and a shoe-tying.
3026040	3028040	You guys, don't team up with him, Spencer.
3028040	3029040	Don't break my heart.
3029040	3030040	I can't help it.
3030040	3033040	I will never ask you to team up with me, but don't team up with him.
3034040	3035040	I'll try.
3036040	3040040	16 constitution, which is a little, is still really strong.
3040040	3042040	You can take some hits and drink a lot also.
3042040	3045040	You can take some hits and eat some machetes.
3049040	3050040	That's my first time, man.
3050040	3051040	That's my first time.
3053040	3055040	I'm just trying to have a good time over here.
3057040	3059040	I'm a barbarian gnome.
3060040	3062040	We have a weird sense of humor, man.
3065040	3066040	All right.
3067040	3070040	You got a 15 wisdom, which means you're reasonably wise
3070040	3072040	and you have a cool head on your shoulders.
3072040	3075040	Oh, I missed 18 intelligence.
3075040	3076040	Sorry about that.
3076040	3077040	That's your main stat.
3077040	3078040	You're really smart.
3078040	3079040	Yeah.
3082040	3083040	Typecasting.
3084040	3085040	These were rolled.
3086040	3087040	Randomly.
3087040	3088040	These are random rolls.
3088040	3089040	Yeah, kind of.
3089040	3090040	Yeah.
3090040	3092040	Like I rolled them randomly and then assigned them to the stats
3092040	3093040	that fit the classes.
3093040	3096040	So like he didn't have an 18 strength and not be able to
3096040	3097040	cast any spells yet.
3097040	3098040	Right, right.
3098040	3099040	That's normal.
3099040	3100040	That's normal.
3100040	3101040	That's just good dungeon master stuff.
3101040	3102040	Well, it's a good character creation.
3102040	3103040	Yeah, exactly.
3103040	3107040	And 11 charisma, which is above average, but you're not going
3107040	3109040	to be winning any beauty contest.
3109040	3111040	You're no Bill Pullman.
3112040	3116040	I'll have to rely on my ability of storytelling to keep my
3116040	3117040	woman at home.
3117040	3118040	Yeah.
3118040	3120040	You got a crossbow and some spells.
3120040	3122040	Like you can shrink people down and make things light up.
3122040	3123040	I can shoot a crossbow.
3123040	3124040	Yeah.
3124040	3126040	You got a crossbow because sometimes you run out of spells
3126040	3127040	and don't want to die.
3127040	3128040	Oh, that's nice.
3129040	3130040	All right.
3130040	3132040	Well, is there anything else you need to add, Spencer?
3132040	3134040	Do you want to talk about how we proceed now that we have our
3134040	3135040	characters?
3135040	3136040	Yeah.
3136040	3139040	I mean, basically we try to play a 15 minute adventure next
3139040	3140040	Harman town.
3140040	3141040	What do you say, audience?
3142040	3143040	Yeah.
3144040	3146040	Well, they're not going to boo.
3147040	3149040	We'll find out whether it's a good idea or a bad one.
3149040	3150040	But maybe we could.
3150040	3151040	Maybe we should.
3151040	3153040	No, I said we kick this off.
3153040	3156040	Next Harman town, we get Sharpie and Quark meat in the field
3156040	3157040	of battle.
3157040	3159040	And so what do you need to do that?
3159040	3163040	Should we put a little table over there so that you have a
3163040	3164040	place to roll dice?
3164040	3165040	Yeah.
3165040	3166040	Just roll dice and map some things.
3166040	3169040	I don't need that many maps, but yeah, dice.
3169040	3170040	All right.
3170040	3171040	Okay.
3171040	3174040	So I think we'll give that a shot next Harman town and see
3174040	3175040	how it goes from there.
3175040	3176040	All right.
3176040	3177040	Thank you, Spencer.
3177040	3178040	Spencer, everybody.
3179040	3191040	That's a lot of work Spencer's putting in for us.
3191040	3192040	It's nice of him.
3192040	3194040	I think we got the right man for the job, though.
3194040	3195040	I think so.
3195040	3196040	He's lovable, isn't he?
3196040	3197040	He is.
3200040	3201040	Yeah.
3201040	3205040	He approaches his job with sincerity.
3206040	3211040	I did an interview today, a small one with a guy from Time
3211040	3214040	magazine, which I think most of the time when they say you're
3214040	3215040	doing an interview for Time.
3215040	3216040	Thank you, sir.
3216040	3219040	I think they actually just mean, and they're plotting the
3219040	3222040	arrival of the vodka.
3222040	3224040	I did an interview with a guy on the phone just about the
3224040	3226040	Anomalisa Kickstarter.
3226040	3229040	Why don't you explain that briefly for people that don't
3229040	3230040	know?
3230040	3232040	Go donate if the time's not up yet.
3232040	3233040	Go to Kickstarter.
3233040	3234040	Look for Anomalisa.
3234040	3237040	It's a Charlie Kaufman script that we're producing through
3237040	3238040	our studio Starburns.
3238040	3241040	It's going to be a stop motion feature written by Charlie
3241040	3242040	Kaufman.
3242040	3244040	You can go kick in some money, and we'll make it as good as
3244040	3246040	we can, as well as we can.
3246040	3247040	See, we'll correct.
3247040	3250040	We'll do a grammar check if you give us enough money.
3250040	3256040	The guy that interviewed me from Time, his name was Harry
3256040	3257040	McCracken.
3258040	3259040	And that's it.
3259040	3261040	That's the end of that story.
3261040	3262040	For real?
3262040	3263040	I wrote that in my...
3263040	3264040	Harry McCracken.
3264040	3265040	Is that a nom de plume, or that's his name?
3265040	3266040	I don't know.
3266040	3267040	It's Phil's brother.
3267040	3268040	You know?
3268040	3269040	That's his real name.
3269040	3270040	You've worked for him?
3270040	3271040	This is his actual name.
3271040	3274040	He's worked for PC World.
3274040	3275040	Harry McCracken.
3275040	3276040	Harry McCracken.
3276040	3277040	That's the best.
3277040	3278040	Sorry, I didn't mean to talk.
3278040	3279040	No, no, no.
3279040	3280040	God damn it.
3280040	3282040	I didn't mean to become Ming the Merciless.
3282040	3285040	That guy just...
3285040	3287040	A guy from the audience just said, I worked for Harry
3287040	3289040	McCracken, and that's his real name.
3289040	3292040	You know, I think Spencer came up here and dispelled some
3292040	3295040	of the evil magic that was up on that stage.
3295040	3297040	Well, I can't wait to listen to the recording of tonight
3297040	3301040	and see who went wrong where, but I did not feel like I came
3301040	3303040	up here with any negative energy.
3303040	3305040	I guess I said the first thing I said is, hey, pink hair,
3305040	3307040	you're going to be in trouble.
3307040	3308040	That was rude.
3308040	3309040	I think...
3309040	3310040	I blame pink hair.
3310040	3311040	That's what it is.
3311040	3313040	Yeah, but you came out and blamed pink hair, but she hadn't
3313040	3315040	even done anything as far as I had seen.
3315040	3316040	Thank you, thank you.
3316040	3318040	Did something go wrong in the line?
3318040	3319040	Did you meet her earlier?
3319040	3320040	No, it didn't go wrong.
3320040	3321040	I just...
3321040	3322040	I was being sincere.
3322040	3324040	My first thought, because I saw the pink hair, and then I
3324040	3328040	thought, trouble, because in the line, she was kind of like...
3328040	3329040	She was excited.
3329040	3330040	You were excited.
3330040	3331040	I was excited to see you.
3331040	3332040	I know.
3332040	3333040	You don't have to...
3333040	3334040	I know why.
3334040	3335040	No, it's not...
3335040	3337040	Because it can be...
3337040	3338040	Well, look what happened.
3338040	3341040	I guess the story we're learning, the ironic Greek myth, is
3341040	3343040	that I thought it would be trouble.
3343040	3344040	I tried to prevent the trouble.
3344040	3345040	I caused all the trouble.
3345040	3347040	Is that what we're learning?
3347040	3348040	I'm...
3348040	3349040	You caused the trouble.
3349040	3351040	Yes, so I caused the trouble.
3351040	3352040	Jeez.
3352040	3353040	You know?
3353040	3354040	Take it to the bank.
3354040	3357040	It's the last check you're going to get.
3357040	3361040	It's the last time I'm ever going to be wrong about anything.
3361040	3364040	Promise you that.
3364040	3367040	Sometimes at Harbin Town, I have to lay down the law.
3372040	3373040	All right.
3373040	3374040	What else is on the docket?
3374040	3378040	Let's do some more infidelity questions, apparently.
3378040	3380040	How about now...
3380040	3382040	Here's a goodie.
3382040	3384040	Somebody in the audience writes,
3384040	3386040	I am a gay male.
3386040	3389040	I recently stopped seeing a guy because he insisted on a
3389040	3391040	quote, open relationship.
3391040	3394040	He insisted that it would only be physical and not emotional.
3394040	3398040	Is a quote, physically open relationship possible?
3398040	3400040	Or any kind, for that matter?
3400040	3402040	Boy, that's a lot of spaghetti.
3403040	3405040	If I'm getting him right,
3405040	3408040	he's saying that his partner said,
3408040	3410040	let's be in an open relationship.
3410040	3413040	But he insisted it would only be physical and not emotional.
3413040	3415040	By it, he means what?
3415040	3416040	The new relationship?
3416040	3418040	The new relationship would only be a physical.
3418040	3419040	I'm only going to fuck another guy.
3419040	3420040	I'm not going to fall in love with him.
3420040	3421040	I'm not going to love another guy.
3421040	3422040	I'm just going to fuck another guy.
3422040	3424040	I'm just going to fillet him frequently.
3424040	3428040	Yeah, and so his final question is, is that possible?
3428040	3431040	Is there such a thing as a physically open relationship?
3431040	3433040	I don't think so.
3433040	3438040	And I don't think the rules are probably any different for our gay friends,
3438040	3440040	our fine feathered gay friends.
3442040	3445040	I picture them as like a hawk species in a...
3446040	3447040	Die!
3449040	3450040	Second wave!
3450040	3451040	Die!
3453040	3454040	That guy was gay.
3454040	3457040	The actor that played the leader of the Hawkmen in Flash Gordon.
3457040	3458040	Oh, yeah.
3458040	3459040	Brian Blessed, whom I love.
3460040	3464040	Yeah, he was a big burly gay dude who was awesome as the leader of the Hawkmen.
3464040	3466040	Gay is a French horn, but so funny.
3466040	3468040	That's why I said our fine feathered gay friends.
3468040	3470040	I was picturing a battalion of...
3470040	3475040	When I said our gay friends, I just pictured looking at a portal in a spaceship
3475040	3480040	and seeing a fleet of hawk people that were there to save the day.
3483040	3485040	I'm sure it's the same for everybody.
3485040	3488040	I can't tell if that's diminishing gay people or I'm really exalting them.
3488040	3490040	It's up to them, I don't know.
3490040	3492040	Up to them and the Hawks.
3493040	3498040	Hey man, when the Hawks have sex in the air though, man, they die.
3498040	3499040	They plummet.
3499040	3504040	Don't get Levi fucking hysterical to a point where I think he's heckling me.
3506040	3507040	Stop it!
3507040	3508040	Pink hair.
3508040	3509040	God damn it.
3509040	3510040	Pink hair and Levi.
3514040	3515040	It's like having a...
3515040	3516040	It's like poncho on the left.
3516040	3518040	A bundle of dynamite in the front row.
3518040	3520040	It's not my fault.
3520040	3522040	It's sweating nitroglycerin, you know?
3522040	3524040	It's like you shake it and it blows up.
3524040	3528040	Okay, gay people, hear my voice.
3532040	3535040	Sex comes easier for you because men are pigs
3535040	3539040	and gay men couples are easier to hook up and stuff,
3539040	3541040	but I think that's the only difference.
3541040	3543040	I imagine that everyone that goes to bed together,
3543040	3547040	no matter what they're doing, is cosmically intermingling a little bit.
3547040	3551040	There's an emotional component to all sex, otherwise all we'd all do is jerk off.
3551040	3555040	If you got the same energy from an orgasm, no matter what you were doing,
3555040	3558040	it doesn't matter what promises you make.
3558040	3563040	So as much as this poor gentleman probably doesn't need or want to hear it,
3563040	3567040	his mate that's saying, can I be in an open room?
3567040	3571040	I'm agreeing with his obvious anxiety, which is no, there's no such thing as a physical...
3572040	3577040	You can't love one guy and then be physical with another guy
3577040	3579040	and then never the twain shall meet.
3579040	3583040	Several people, I went through the questions that people wrote down in the audience.
3583040	3588040	Surprisingly, almost word for word, people asked, and several of you asked,
3588040	3594040	what's worse, physically cheating or emotionally cheating?
3594040	3595040	Right.
3595040	3598040	Apparently that was on everybody's minds.
3598040	3600040	What would be more hurtful?
3600040	3602040	I'm way too old-fashioned to...
3602040	3605040	I think that there are people who are better equipped for this
3605040	3609040	because I don't think my advice would be or my insights would be as valid.
3609040	3615040	I've often observed that people who are growing up in an age of text messaging
3615040	3621040	and Facebooking and all this stuff, they are a little more shielded in the right places.
3621040	3623040	I am a 39-year-old maniac.
3623040	3628040	When I have a girlfriend, I get nervous and jealous very easily.
3628040	3632040	I think that that's intertwined with the definition of loving somebody.
3632040	3635040	It doesn't make any logical sense, though.
3635040	3636040	It's not practical.
3636040	3641040	I'm not Dr. Phil about when it comes to when you should be jealous and possessive.
3641040	3644040	There's a million people out there, some of them might be in the audience,
3644040	3649040	who are actually capable of doing weird, swingery stuff and totally keeping everything together.
3649040	3653040	Bruce Willis and Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore, whoever the fuck,
3653040	3656040	you can see a tablet, they're all in a boat together like,
3656040	3659040	hey, we all fucked each other, who cares, let's go fishing.
3659040	3662040	It is possible for people to be mature.
3662040	3665040	I was staying in a hotel one time.
3665040	3669040	I was supposed to fly out in the morning but for some reason the flight got cancelled
3669040	3674040	so I had to stay in Reno, Nevada for a night and we stayed at one of the casinos there,
3674040	3676040	one of the big hotel casinos there.
3676040	3681040	I don't know if you've ever been to Reno, it's a little mini country cowboy Vegas,
3681040	3684040	the biggest little city in the world, I think they call it.
3684040	3688040	And are you from there? No, keep it down, man.
3688040	3691040	No, sir.
3691040	3696040	But we stayed at this casino and I was walking into my hotel room
3696040	3700040	and this means some of the guys I was doing, I got a comedy show with,
3700040	3705040	and we're walking to our hotel rooms and on kind of like 80% of the doorways,
3705040	3709040	like the hotel doors, there was a Polaroid of like a couple,
3709040	3712040	like a married couple or a guy in a gal, sometimes just a guy,
3712040	3716040	sometimes just a gal, but there's a Polaroid taped to the doors.
3716040	3720040	And I don't want to think anything of it, I thought there was some thing going on at the convention.
3720040	3725040	So then I go down to the casino and I'm playing roulette and I'm sitting there
3725040	3734040	and I notice like everyone's got these really, really visible bright like hot pink or orange wristbands on.
3734040	3738040	Not everybody, but a lot of people, but also the same kind of age group and style
3738040	3742040	of the people that were in these photos on the doors in the hotel.
3742040	3746040	And so I say to the croupier, what do you call the guy at the roulette table,
3746040	3748040	I said, what's going on?
3748040	3752040	I go, what's with the wristbands and the Polaroids in the door?
3752040	3756040	And he goes, it's a swingers convention.
3756040	3759040	It's like, oh no.
3759040	3766040	Because looking around, I hate to be a jerk, but you wouldn't fuck any one of these people.
3766040	3769040	It was pretty rough. It was pretty rough.
3769040	3771040	And I said, what's up with the Polaroids in the door?
3771040	3776040	And the Polaroids are like, if you walk by a door and you go, oh, that's who's in this room
3776040	3780040	and you can knock on the door and if they want you to come in, you can either join in or watch or whatever.
3780040	3786040	I mean, I guess that's all fun and fine and dandy, but I got to say the mood in that casino was tense
3786040	3791040	because nobody got what they fucking wanted or paid for or yeah, it was rough.
3791040	3797040	And there were a couple of couples that were more on the sexy side of the scale
3797040	3802040	and they were just being worked on by everybody and they were really bummed out and it was bad.
3802040	3806040	In a world where we haven't answered those questions yet, I just keep it simple
3806040	3812040	and just go with what my primal instinct tells me, which is that I want a woman and I want her to be my woman.
3812040	3818040	And if that's unhealthy, it's the unhealthy choice that will get me through a sea of very confusing shit
3818040	3824040	because every person I've ever talked to, every anecdote I've ever heard about three ways
3824040	3829040	and four ways and nine ways and open relationships and she's my old lady, but we have a common law thing
3829040	3833040	and when we do this and that guy lives in her garage and he hangs in a back costume and...
3836040	3839040	None of those end with anyone cutting a cake.
3840040	3845040	I'm sorry, my parents' son, I just want to go...
3845040	3850040	I just want to do the chicken dance and go home and have some kids and like, die.
3850040	3855040	And I want to do it with one person and I don't want Kevin, you know, hanging out.
3855040	3857040	Or Natalie.
3857040	3863040	Those stories end with probably no more.
3863040	3866040	I think those people, like we owe it to them to say,
3866040	3873040	I think that people who are pursuing their bliss, like those people are just as right as monogamists.
3873040	3876040	I think it's random and cosmic.
3876040	3879040	It's like there's stress everywhere. It's fucking stressful.
3879040	3887040	You don't, there's no such thing as waking up every morning with a big hard on for the person that's three feet from you
3887040	3891040	and being happy and then going to bed happy and doing it every day.
3891040	3896040	Because then if that happens, then that's not, human beings aren't happy all the time.
3896040	3899040	Happiness is defined by the unhappiness that follows it.
3899040	3907040	So there is no, I always smell a rat when I talk to people who are like, yeah, we cheated the system.
3907040	3914040	It's like, this is Darla, she's with me, but we go home together, we live together, but I do what I want with Stacy.
3914040	3919040	I always feel like someone's going to kill themselves pretty soon.
3919040	3923040	Stacy's going to murder somebody or something's uncomfortable in bed.
3923040	3929040	But if I'm wrong or if I'm right, there's no time for me to change that fact.
3929040	3936040	I'm all for kids sticking to the addiction, the gum that's under the desk that you touch when it's there.
3936040	3939040	It's like, you want a girlfriend, you want your girlfriend to turn into your wife,
3939040	3942040	you want your wife to turn into the mother of your children, you want to.
3942040	3952040	And infidelity is the static that happens on that TV reception because people fuck up, they fail,
3952040	3961040	and we fantasize and think that we did something wrong or something, and we fail as human beings, infidelity happens.
3961040	3966040	And I don't know if it's a solution to say, hey, my television station is half static.
3966040	3970040	I think you're just, you're still saying the same thing.
3970040	3973040	You're saying it's hard to be in a relationship.
3973040	3976040	And so your solution is to make relationships hard.
3976040	3981040	Well, somebody asked, would you rather be the person that was cheated on or the person that cheated?
3981040	3986040	I would definitely rather be cheated on.
3986040	3991040	Wow, that is a really awesome question.
3991040	3997040	That's a question of perspective because certainly in the long run, you would definitely rather be cheated on.
3997040	4010040	Because fucking, like, you get to stop being in a relationship and you're the hero.
4010040	4017040	You get flooded with pity puss should you want it.
4017040	4019040	Pity puss.
4019040	4021040	Can I talk more about pity puss?
4021040	4024040	You don't even have to force it in conversation. It's going to come up naturally.
4024040	4027040	Let's talk about the joke box. My wife fucked someone.
4027040	4034040	She what? I would never do that. Prove it.
4034040	4038040	Make love to my penis tonight forever.
4038040	4042040	Prove you're not like my wife.
4042040	4047040	You don't break a sweat. You sleep like a baby.
4047040	4053040	And you're not married? Yeah, better to be in the long run because you are in an unhealthy relationship
4053040	4056040	and someone is capable of cheating on you.
4056040	4062040	The problem is the idea of you were in love with her and you can't live without her and she cheated on you.
4062040	4066040	So in the short term, people jump off bridges.
4066040	4070040	That was an unfortunate choice of words.
4070040	4074040	Tony Scott just jumped off a bridge. R.I.P., Tony Scott, whatever.
4074040	4078040	It's not a disrespect to him to use the phrase jump off a bridge.
4078040	4080040	It's just unfortunate.
4080040	4088040	People jump off of spaceships because of relationships, because of people leaving them.
4088040	4090040	That was Ridley Scott.
4090040	4098040	Yeah. Fuck those guys.
4098040	4102040	I'm not a fan. I'm not a fan.
4102040	4105040	Everyone's a fan of every dude's dad.
4105040	4108040	Fuck you, Phyllis Diller. You piece of shit.
4108040	4111040	I'm kidding. I worship Phyllis Diller and I love Tony and Ridley Scott.
4111040	4114040	Ron Paolo, you owe me money.
4114040	4116040	Nice way out. Ron Paolo died.
4116040	4119040	Horseshack. Welcome back, Carter died as well.
4119040	4121040	Welcome to our death segment.
4121040	4128040	This show's got it all. We got infidelity. We got judges and dragons. We got dead people.
4128040	4133040	We have a complete imbalance between the power and the power dynamic of audience and performer.
4133040	4137040	Levi fucked off about 10 minutes ago. We don't know where he went. He's gone.
4137040	4144040	He's jumping off a bridge right now.
4144040	4150040	He's suffocating himself in a giant pair of acid wash pants.
4150040	4156040	It's Levi. It's just because his name is a kind of pants.
4156040	4161040	I'm not going to repeat it.
4161040	4166040	I admire the calm and comfort you have.
4166040	4170040	What? I thought you were from Las Vegas.
4170040	4175040	All right.
4175040	4177040	She just called Dan an ass on that.
4177040	4181040	The back and forth is unpodcastable because no one can hear you.
4181040	4185040	And we don't dare give you a microphone.
4185040	4190040	All right. No, no. Give it to her. Give it to her.
4190040	4192040	Jesus Christ.
4192040	4198040	I walked toward her with a microphone and a mutiny.
4198040	4205040	There's nothing wrong with you as a human being. I'm not saying.
4205040	4211040	I just admire her zeal and her comfort of just completely shoehorning herself into the show.
4211040	4212040	I think it's fantastic.
4212040	4214040	But as we established, OK, we got to the bottom.
4214040	4216040	I stepped up on stage. I drew first blood.
4216040	4220040	I immediately all of a sudden I shouldn't have done that. I shook that can.
4220040	4223040	I was doing a callback. I thought, oh, there was energy out there in the line.
4223040	4226040	I think I'll do a big callback. I don't know what I was thinking.
4226040	4229040	I'm an idiot. I'm not. This isn't my job.
4229040	4233040	This is what I don't write on my tax form. I don't go show runner.
4233040	4236040	Wait. Yes, you do.
4236040	4240040	Not anymore. But it's a live show runner.
4240040	4242040	I don't say there's a town with my name on it.
4242040	4244040	I guess I do.
4244040	4246040	What the fuck were we talking about?
4246040	4249040	What were we just talking about? It was important.
4249040	4251040	No, we weren't talking about Levi.
4251040	4252040	Jumping off bridges.
4252040	4254040	We weren't talking about jumping off bridges.
4254040	4256040	I mean, we were, but we shouldn't have been.
4256040	4258040	Long-term confidentiality.
4258040	4261040	Infidelity. Yeah, people broken hearted. Whatever.
4261040	4264040	Yes, I would rather be cheated on because the long-term...
4264040	4268040	All right. Here's a short question. Woody Allen. Thoughts?
4273040	4277040	I do have thoughts because Aaron just pulled up that documentary on Woody Allen.
4277040	4281040	Many people, by applause, have seen that Woody Allen documentary.
4281040	4284040	That is very interesting watching that.
4284040	4286040	It's so revelatory.
4286040	4291040	Woody Allen is a ubiquitous genius.
4291040	4295040	Everyone in this room has grown up surrounded by his movies
4295040	4298040	because he makes almost literally one per year
4298040	4301040	and has been doing it for how many decades?
4301040	4303040	Some of them hit and some of them miss,
4303040	4308040	but he's made more good movies than any of his peers
4308040	4311040	because he's made more bad movies.
4311040	4314040	I never got that perspective on him.
4314040	4319040	There's this studying of his personality by talking to all of the people around him.
4319040	4321040	He seems to have...
4321040	4326040	I was relieved to find out that he really...
4326040	4329040	His circuit board and his brain is kind of like...
4329040	4335040	There's a couple of scorch marks there, which is nice
4335040	4338040	because it means that we don't all owe it to ourselves to go home
4338040	4342040	and try to be Woody Allen because it's clearly...
4342040	4345040	I think it's genetic. I think it's neurological.
4345040	4347040	He does it...
4347040	4350040	What was the movie that he was writing in the documentary?
4350040	4353040	He was writing one of his good movies
4353040	4356040	while all of the shit was going down in the tabloids
4356040	4359040	about him and Sun Yi.
4359040	4361040	Can anyone shout it out?
4361040	4363040	He was writing Husband's Wives.
4363040	4365040	Wait, was that a good one or not?
4365040	4368040	Was it Broadway Danny Rose or Husband's Wives?
4368040	4370040	No, it couldn't have been Broadway Danny Rose.
4370040	4372040	Those are both good movies.
4372040	4374040	I don't think it was Bullets Over Broadway either.
4374040	4375040	Husband's Wives probably.
4375040	4377040	Curly Sue.
4377040	4379040	Curly Sue.
4379040	4382040	This is a story about him taking phone calls with his lawyer
4382040	4383040	and going like,
4383040	4385040	you might want to get a blood sample.
4385040	4387040	And then coming back and sitting down and just riffing bits
4387040	4388040	to do the show.
4388040	4391040	And the end result is a fine movie that everyone enjoyed.
4391040	4393040	Then they have that montage of everyone going,
4393040	4395040	he compartmentalizes.
4395040	4397040	He compartmentalizes.
4397040	4402040	Another word for compartmentalizing is autism.
4402040	4405040	There are different parts of his brain
4405040	4408040	that are incapable of crossing into other parts of his brain.
4408040	4411040	And he's one of those rare people that...
4412040	4415040	Those compartments are shaped in a Tetris block
4415040	4417040	that makes movies.
4417040	4420040	And he just keeps making them and making good ones
4420040	4422040	and good ones and good ones.
4422040	4425040	To me it was a relief because I'm a narcissist
4425040	4427040	and everyone who does anything creative.
4427040	4430040	I don't care if you make a rocking chair or a stained glass window.
4430040	4433040	My big thought in my head is,
4433040	4438040	do I need to prove that I can do that better or worse?
4438040	4440040	Am I under threat here?
4441040	4443040	You beat your wife, right?
4443040	4445040	That's why you make such good stained glass windows?
4445040	4446040	I don't know.
4446040	4450040	I'm always looking for some way to make myself feel at ease
4450040	4453040	that I am still a contributor to my society.
4453040	4457040	That what I do is important and that I'm doing it right
4457040	4460040	and that I don't need to work harder at it or less hard at it.
4460040	4463040	Watching that documentary really relaxed me
4463040	4466040	because Woody Allen has haunted me a long time.
4466040	4467040	Because I always think,
4467040	4469040	Jesus Christ, how do you do what he does?
4469040	4474040	You said to me recently that there might be some money coming in on syndication
4474040	4477040	and if you ever got that money coming in that you would stop writing.
4477040	4479040	You said this before, that you might retire.
4479040	4480040	You would never work again.
4480040	4481040	You would just do that.
4481040	4483040	I don't imagine that you would be able to do that.
4483040	4484040	No, I don't think I would.
4484040	4486040	You say that.
4486040	4491040	I say that because I feel like I'm trying to win some game
4491040	4493040	against people that I hate.
4493040	4496040	I don't want to be rich and I won't care but I'll always care.
4496040	4502040	I'll die writing the worst shit that I've ever written.
4502040	4505040	I'm all fucked up.
4505040	4508040	Don't say aww.
4508040	4512040	If they're going to say aww, that's when they should say it.
4512040	4518040	I will be 70 years old if I'm lucky
4518040	4522040	and I'll just be working on some fucking piece of garbage.
4523040	4528040	I'll just be trying to prove that I'm trying to untie some knot in my head
4528040	4531040	of how you're supposed to make yourself happy.
4531040	4534040	I just talked to Mitch Hurwitz about this name drop.
4534040	4538040	I was on the set of Arrested Development and I met Mitch Hurwitz
4538040	4543040	and he said so many things that I had been thinking
4543040	4548040	which was such a great thing to hear him say it.
4548040	4554040	One of the things that we talked about was the fact that when we make things
4554040	4558040	we're trying to entertain everyone in the world.
4558040	4562040	We're not ever, ever, ever trying to exclude anybody
4562040	4567040	but the only way you could possibly ever stand a chance of entertaining everybody
4567040	4570040	is if you're entertaining yourself.
4570040	4572040	Otherwise you're a hack.
4572040	4575040	You don't say, well, people like got milk.
4575040	4577040	That's a funny joke.
4577040	4580040	If you say got milk then everyone will laugh.
4580040	4582040	That's what I've learned and you're not laughing the whole time.
4582040	4584040	It's garbage. It's hackery.
4584040	4586040	It works for some people because they get lucky
4586040	4588040	because there's only so much shit to watch out there.
4588040	4591040	The truth is if you really want to make people happy
4591040	4594040	you have to know who you are and what you want and express it
4594040	4596040	and make yourself laugh if you're doing comedy.
4596040	4600040	Then it's your tough luck if only 3 million people like it
4600040	4602040	as opposed to 18 million people.
4602040	4605040	Mitch Hurwitz was exactly the same as me going,
4605040	4608040	I wish everybody liked everything that I did.
4608040	4612040	I really do but I'm not going to change what he does
4612040	4614040	because then what he'd be doing,
4614040	4616040	he'd be writing an animated penguin movie.
4616040	4618040	It would be terrible.
4618040	4621040	It would be worse than an animated penguin movie that you like.
4621040	4624040	There's one that you like and it was written by a guy
4624040	4626040	who was operating at the top of his game.
4626040	4628040	He woke up with a boner for animated penguins.
4628040	4632040	Mitch Hurwitz would be slumming it and betraying you.
4632040	4634040	You'd be watching a liar lie.
4634040	4639040	He has to do what he has to do at the top of his RPMs
4639040	4641040	and just be bummed out.
4641040	4643040	What were we talking about? Infidelity?
4643040	4645040	Woody Allen.
4645040	4647040	Woody Allen.
4647040	4650040	It relaxed me a lot to watch that documentary.
4650040	4652040	Those were my thoughts. I had a lot of thoughts.
4652040	4654040	Aaron and I talked about Woody Allen for a long time.
4654040	4656040	Aaron's observation was like,
4656040	4659040	he's a jazz musician on top of all this?
4659040	4663040	He has this weird disconnection where he's able to focus on people
4663040	4665040	but he doesn't work with the actors.
4665040	4667040	He just casts people like they're crayons in a crayon box.
4667040	4669040	He doesn't even talk to them.
4669040	4671040	Then he sends them a script and says,
4671040	4675040	you can do the lines the way I wrote them or don't.
4675040	4677040	If anyone else said that, they'd be full of shit.
4677040	4680040	They'd be just saying that because he really means it.
4680040	4682040	He doesn't give a fuck if you do the script or not.
4682040	4684040	He's Woody Allen and he doesn't care if you do his script.
4684040	4688040	The actor, he's on the set and he described it as like,
4688040	4693040	he's like, the people do the take and you say cut
4693040	4696040	and then they look at you like, did I do a good job?
4696040	4699040	Of course, you can't stare at them all day,
4699040	4701040	so you have to say something.
4701040	4703040	You say, that was fine.
4703040	4707040	That's a person talking that's like, people are mannequins to him.
4707040	4710040	He's just playing a video game
4710040	4713040	where everyone is like an obstacle to get past
4713040	4715040	so that he can do what he wants to do.
4715040	4717040	He's just playing Grand Theft Auto.
4717040	4722040	His goal is to make the most movies ever, which is great.
4722040	4724040	You can emulate yourself.
4724040	4727040	The relieving thing is that, no, his brain is shaped different.
4727040	4728040	You can't.
4728040	4730040	You got to do what you want to do.
4730040	4731040	He's doing what he wants to do.
4731040	4733040	What's the difference of the shape of your brain
4733040	4734040	that makes you do what you do well?
4734040	4737040	Mine's shaped like a planet.
4737040	4740040	It has beautiful clouds.
4740040	4741040	I don't know.
4741040	4743040	What would be your crowning achievement?
4743040	4744040	It's just such a thing.
4744040	4746040	Is it something you'd want?
4746040	4749040	Would you like best screenplay or something like that?
4749040	4750040	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4750040	4753040	Best original screenplay of Oscar.
4753040	4756040	If I got that, then it would be hard to get up the next day.
4756040	4762040	I would probably play a lot of Minecraft after I got it.
4762040	4765040	I would be like, okay, what am I?
4765040	4767040	Do you think, come on, let's go on a hike.
4767040	4771040	Yeah, can I hike my way to another one of these motherfuckers?
4772040	4774040	How about more chocolate pudding?
4774040	4777040	Will you endeavor to do that?
4777040	4779040	Yeah, I want to.
4779040	4783040	There were times when Dan and I were friends years ago
4783040	4785040	when he was broke or I was broke
4785040	4787040	and we're both helping each other out and stuff like that.
4787040	4789040	You have these script ideas.
4789040	4792040	There were times when you seemed like more of a feature writer than a TV writer.
4792040	4793040	That's why I came out here.
4793040	4794040	I didn't even know you could write TV.
4794040	4798040	Like most of us, I thought the people on TV were making it up.
4798040	4800040	You just kind of felt that when you watched TV.
4800040	4803040	Oh, Alan Alda is hilarious in the Korean War.
4803040	4805040	He should do more stuff.
4805040	4806040	He's great.
4806040	4810040	Jerry Seinfeld's like, whoa, what a great observation about socks.
4812040	4815040	Why didn't they think of putting him with Kramer for a long time ago?
4815040	4817040	You just kind of have that feeling about TV.
4817040	4820040	It doesn't feel like it's written if it's good.
4820040	4824040	And yeah, I never, the TV I fell into on accident.
4824040	4825040	I wanted to write movies.
4825040	4826040	Before that, I wanted to write books.
4826040	4828040	I always wanted to be legit.
4830040	4833040	Don't quote me, man, because I said shit.
4833040	4834040	Easy.
4834040	4836040	I said, look him up.
4837040	4838040	Died of AIDS.
4838040	4841040	Jumped off the bridge of AIDS.
4842040	4846040	You know, Phyllis Diller, whom I love, she died today, right?
4846040	4849040	And she was 95, and she died in her sleep.
4849040	4853040	And whoever found her, like, was one of her children.
4853040	4856040	So someone came into the house and found her, and she had a smile on her face.
4856040	4857040	Oh, come on.
4857040	4859040	And I was like, that's how you fucking do it.
4859040	4863040	Why can't we all, why can't we all live to between 70 and 90
4863040	4865040	and just turn to dust?
4866040	4870040	Why does it always have to be like, his heart did this,
4870040	4872040	and his liver did that, and his lung had this thing,
4872040	4874040	and then he had a complicated thing.
4874040	4876040	And it's, ugh, it's a...
4876040	4879040	I met Phyllis Diller after a show at the improv.
4879040	4883040	I think she was 89, and she put down in my presence
4883040	4886040	four pretty big beef-eater gin martinis,
4886040	4888040	and she was just solid as a rock.
4889040	4893040	And also, I was on stage for a while, so she might have had a couple in there.
4893040	4897040	And she had a diamond the size of, like, a billiard ball.
4897040	4899040	Apparently that was worth, like, just a zillion dollars.
4899040	4902040	And she's quite wealthy.
4902040	4905040	She'd done very well, first off, and she was one of the first female comedians
4905040	4907040	that, like, made it possible for women.
4907040	4909040	And she was just, like, this beautiful...
4909040	4912040	And she made her whole career about being ugly, but she really wasn't.
4912040	4914040	She was really beautiful. She was very pretty.
4914040	4918040	And she was 37 years old when she started.
4918040	4920040	She had five kids or something like that. She was a housewife.
4920040	4923040	She was 37 years old when she started her career,
4923040	4926040	and she died a beloved, amazing person
4926040	4929040	at 95 years old with a fucking smile on her face.
4929040	4932040	It made me so happy and also wistful and sad all day long.
4932040	4934040	I think that put me in a very strange mood today.
4934040	4937040	I was like, you couldn't do it any better than that, I don't think.
4937040	4939040	Well, Tony Scott put me in a strange mood.
4939040	4943040	I'm not gonna... Obviously, my relationship with pink hair
4943040	4945040	is what really set things off.
4946040	4948040	The Tony Scott thing put me in a bad mood
4948040	4950040	because it reminded me of Spalding Gray.
4950040	4952040	It reminded me of Hunter Thompson.
4952040	4955040	I don't like suicides. It made me very uncomfortable
4955040	4957040	because I feel like I'm a very weak person,
4957040	4960040	and I feel like if I get sick, and it's rumored that I'm...
4960040	4962040	You look for reasons with this stuff.
4962040	4964040	I want to know why did Tony Scott do this?
4964040	4966040	I heard the rumor that he had terminal brain cancer.
4966040	4968040	I don't know if that's still a rumor.
4968040	4970040	Does anybody out there know?
4970040	4971040	Still a rumor.
4972040	4978040	That makes me very uncomfortable because it just feels too close to home.
4978040	4980040	It feels too close to some hypothetical home.
4980040	4985040	I feel like I wouldn't have the strength to endure hardship.
4985040	4989040	I told on Friday the story of me calling an ambulance
4989040	4994040	because I had too much coffee, and I was miserable.
4994040	4998040	I'm a pretty cut off your nose despite your face guy.
4998040	5002040	I'm a pretty fuck you if you don't want me kind of guy.
5002040	5006040	If a guy makes a joke about the party being over, he knows.
5006040	5009040	Yeah, I might just teach him a lesson.
5009040	5012040	Just blow my brains out.
5012040	5014040	That's a joke.
5014040	5016040	If you get diagnosed with a terminal illness,
5016040	5019040	just to walk around with that, pick your time.
5019040	5020040	Pick your time.
5020040	5022040	Hey, can I get a loan?
5022040	5025040	I just want to get a loan at this bank.
5025040	5026040	Well, you know...
5026040	5027040	You got milk?
5030040	5034040	Just to teach one person an invaluable lesson.
5034040	5035040	Shoes untied, bro.
5035040	5038040	Oh, really? Well, then fuck it.
5041040	5043040	Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.
5043040	5045040	You guys have been wonderful, as always.
5048040	5050040	Oh, shit.
5050040	5051040	I always forget.
5051040	5053040	Let me find the thank yous.
5053040	5055040	Nobody go anywhere.
5055040	5057040	Keep clapping. It's fun.
5058040	5060040	We have people to thank.

5066040	5068040	What's your name? A new checker?
5071040	5072040	Kyle Clark, I believe he says.
5072040	5074040	His name will help me get that sick.

5099040	5100040	Who else did we abuse?
5100040	5101040	Anybody?
5101040	5102040	No? No.
5103040	5104040	Goodnight, all.
5104040	5105040	You guys are awesome. Thank you.
