0	12000	This wiggling time can't give it no credit I thought about my speech
12000	17000	Ladies and gentlemen, Harman Town is now in session!
17000	21000	I'm your guest comptroller, Camille Nantiani.
21000	27000	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
27000	36000	Thank you, guest comptroller Camille Nantiani. Good to have him back.
36000	45000	Alright, I got dressed in the dark again and I put on one of Aaron's sweatshirts.
45000	49000	You know what, I was going to tell you I really like that sweatshirt.
49000	53000	You know what, maybe I need to have the confidence to wear tiny people's clothing.
53000	57000	Because every time I do, people go like, oh, have you lost weight?
57000	61000	And I'm like, no, you should say the opposite. I'm bursting out of little doll clothing.
61000	64000	It's also purple, that's also part of the vibe.
64000	66000	Yeah, well that's good. It's modern.
66000	68000	It's my favorite color, purple.
68000	71000	I don't want to talk about fashion.
71000	75000	You should start every episode like that.
75000	82000	I want to talk about people with children and how they should stop bringing them to fucking hipster parties.
83000	87000	I'm 41, it's already hard for me to be at a party of 25-year-olds.
87000	92000	I don't want your fucking three-year-old wandering around, bumping into walls at 8.30 p.m.
92000	95000	when there's a campfire over here and a keg over there.
95000	100000	It's like, nah, she's got fucking spider whiskers on her face.
100000	108000	You're a 25-year-old parent, you're so close to fucking everything up already.
109000	114000	And it's so hard for me to be at a party and your three-year-old is complaining about shit
114000	119000	and I'm the only other one other than this person that's not going to talk to anybody.
119000	126000	So I'm stuck with your three-year-old, but then I have a choice between looking like a pedophile and looking like a curmudgeon.
126000	130000	Because your kid's going like, I don't like this, I don't like that.
130000	135000	I'm biting my tongue because I'm like, bitch, no one cares what you like.
135000	139000	It's like me. I created community. I ain't talking to anybody either.
139000	142000	Just keep eating dirt.
142000	146000	And their names, their hipsters, their names are now always like Hunter or Dagobah or something.
146000	151000	Ophelia, Dagobah, stop. Chewbacca, Chewbacca, go to...
151000	154000	The worst thing isn't the kids because the kids are fine, whatever.
154000	159000	They're dumb. They're as dumb as their parents and worse because they don't know how to read yet.
159000	163000	But their parents are the worst because their parents are 25-years-old
163000	168000	and their parents think that producing another Silver Lake hipster out of their loins
168000	174000	licenses them to be the same people they were at a party only now louder.
174000	179000	I get to be the big doofus lumbering around the party only now every once in a while I get to go,
179000	182000	Clemen, what are you doing? Clemen, Clemen!
182000	185000	God damn it, shut the fuck up.
185000	191000	Shut up. Stop yelling at your kid like talking over, like, what are you doing?
191000	194000	What do we say? What are we doing?
194000	199000	There's a lot of we. When you go to the farmer's market, it's a fucking nightmare over there.
199000	202000	What's going on over there, buddy?
202000	205000	You're occupying space with other human beings.
205000	209000	Those same people will complain about cell phone usage in a bar.
209000	211000	Hey, buddy, you can take that phone outside?
211000	215000	Take your fucking three-year-old away from my life. Get him out of here.
215000	219000	Hey, suspender, what are you doing over there?
219000	224000	The itsy bitsy spider. Shut the fuck up. I'm trying to drink.
224000	230000	It's like there's a fire at child level. We're in a backyard.
230000	234000	Get your kid home. You had a child. You're out.
234000	236000	Yeah. Tap out of society.
236000	239000	You know the rules. You know the rules.
239000	242000	You reproduced. You're out of there.
242000	247000	There's beer here. There's fun here. You're gone.
247000	251000	You replicated. Get out of society.
251000	255000	Go play itsy bitsy spider if it's so fucking fun.
255000	258000	You're acting like it's fun because I'm here.
258000	264000	It's not fun, itsy bitsy spider. It's repetitive and derivative and shitty.
264000	266000	Like your kids.
266000	271000	It's the 27 dresses of shit you say to kids.
271000	279000	The Matthew McConaughey didn't know how to commit, so he wrote a marriage column for a...
279000	283000	I think that's a plot of seven Matthew McConaughey movies.
283000	286000	He doesn't know how to commit, girls.
286000	294000	I will say, I don't know much about parties, but if your options at parties are either looking like a curmudgeon or a pedophile, go with curmudgeon.
294000	297000	Well, then I'm going to tell a lot of little girls to fuck up.
297000	303000	Yeah, that's better than, is the creator of community trying to seduce our child?
303000	311000	Because I went to, you know, I have a wife now, and I...
311000	318000	Which ratchets me up into suspicion of pedophilia by like 150%.
318000	323000	Yeah, why would he get married if he didn't want to fuck kids?
323000	329000	I'm just saying I fit the profile even more. I'm one white van away from like...
329000	338000	I'm just saying, like, my wife, the girlfriend word sticks in my throat now.
338000	348000	My wife made a bunch of pies for a pie party, and we took him to a backyard. She's 30.
348000	352000	I'm 41. I don't have pie parties. We went to a backyard.
352000	359000	Exactly the age difference between my dad and my mom, 11 years. She was 16, though, so...
359000	366000	I guess my dad got married because he was a pedophile. It was a different time.
366000	371000	It was on the bubble, and it was on the Pakistani Riviera.
371000	372000	Yes.
372000	374000	Blame it on Rio.
374000	380000	Yeah. The laws are cheap, and life is cheaper.
380000	386000	And everything is controlled indirectly by a distant alla goblin.
386000	390000	Did you call him alla goblin? Is that what you called him?
390000	393000	Alla... No, alla goblin.
393000	397000	Oh, I thought you said alla goblin.
397000	399000	No!
399000	401000	You know, this is going everywhere.
401000	402000	No! No!
402000	404000	We're not laid-back people.
404000	407000	I never said alla goblin!
407000	410000	Tell your friends I did not say that.
410000	412000	All right. Settle down, guys.
412000	413000	Oh, my God.
413000	415000	Put that away.
415000	416000	Alla gobble-y.
416000	417000	Alla gobble-y.
417000	421000	It's like a monopoly, but it's with a bunch of old witch-rich people.
421000	423000	Not alla goblin.
423000	426000	No, no, alla is not a goblin.
426000	428000	If you're watching this...
428000	430000	He is. He's watching everything.
430000	434000	Well, he doesn't need fucking YouTube to see this.
434000	437000	It's not alla I'm worried about offending.
437000	440000	It's his goblins.
445000	448000	It's his biggest fans.
448000	450000	The...
450000	451000	So I wanted to...
451000	452000	Okay, so keep your fucking...
452000	457000	If you're 25 and you had a kid, you're still a child.
457000	461000	Learn to interact with your child and have a handle on them
461000	463000	before you take them to a party where I'm going to be.
463000	467000	Because I'm already at a party with children, like you, a 25-year-old,
467000	472000	and now you're fucking spouting, like, little mogwai.
474000	477000	I'm going to mention all of you in my suicide note.
477000	480000	I'm going to go, suspender and itsy bitsy spider,
480000	483000	and that's why Hemingway is done with all of you.
483000	486000	I barely am hanging on for dear life.
486000	488000	Yeah, I don't like...
488000	492000	Because it's also weird, if you meet a baby, and the baby doesn't like you,
492000	495000	everyone's like, what the fuck's wrong with you?
495000	496000	It's a stupid baby.
496000	498000	I love telling kids to fuck off.
498000	500000	Fuck you, and then they start liking you.
500000	502000	It's like the oldest lesson of the book.
502000	505000	It does kind of sound like you're trying to fuck the children.
505000	508000	My wife made some pies for a pie party.
508000	509000	We took them to the pie party.
509000	513000	There was this grubby little girl, this little fucking urchin,
513000	516000	rolling around in the dirt, and she was like,
516000	519000	as people put the pies down at the table, I was watching her.
519000	521000	No one else was watching her.
521000	524000	Do you sound like the wrong side?
524000	525000	I was watching her.
525000	529000	That's the wrong side of the curmudgeon pedophile, divide.
529000	532000	When I walked into that party, I saw her.
532000	534000	I noticed her, right away.
534000	536000	Now we realize what my problem is, okay.
536000	538000	All right, I surrender, you're right.
538000	541000	But she was like digging into the pies,
541000	544000	it was like, we're going to eat those, you fucking grub.
544000	546000	Where's your hipster parents?
546000	550000	They wouldn't let you eat their fucking shit with your grubby gremlin hands.
550000	554000	That's my wife's pie, you bitch.
554000	557000	And then Erin put her pie down,
557000	560000	and one of her fucking 11 awesome pies was like this bacon pie.
560000	562000	And the little girl looked at the pie.
562000	565000	She was going from pie to pie, digging into it with her fucking claws.
565000	570000	Her little hepatitis claws, her little dirt talons
570000	573000	that she was just using to play with worms and be like,
573000	575000	this worm should marry this worm.
575000	577000	Okay, now pie time.
577000	579000	And it's like now we're all like, why am I sick?
579000	581000	Why am I dying?
581000	583000	Her Ebola paws.
583000	586000	She's watching her dig into each pie.
586000	587000	No one's stopping the kid?
587000	589000	No one's conscious of the kid.
589000	592000	I'm the only one because I'm either a curmudgeon or a pedophile.
592000	595000	And watch it, she digs it, she's pie, pie, pie.
595000	596000	She's going from pie to pie, and she's like,
596000	598000	it's like my dog.
598000	601000	She's like maybe off the rim, she's grabbing little crusts
601000	604000	and her mouth and her claw and her mouth.
604000	606000	And then Erin sets one of her pies down
606000	607000	and it's a bacon pie.
607000	609000	And the little girl looks at the pie and she goes,
609000	613000	I don't know, I don't like bacon that much.
613000	617000	And oh, I wanted to go bitch, no one cares what you like.
617000	619000	No one cares what you like and you're going to spend
619000	622000	the next 80 years, if you're lucky, learning that.
622000	624000	No one cares what you like.
624000	625000	No one.
625000	629000	It's you in a fucking vast sea of apathy.
629000	632000	Like who put it in your head already at this age?
632000	635000	Those are the first words you're learning to form.
635000	638000	I'm not sure about this kind of pie.
638000	642000	Fuck you, 9-11 should have happened then.
642000	643000	To her?
643000	644000	I didn't say any of that to her.
644000	646000	I'm like, okay.
646000	647000	You should have explained to her,
647000	649000	she probably doesn't know what 9-11 is.
649000	652000	I'm not engaging her.
652000	654000	But then I'm sitting down by the fire in the backyard,
654000	656000	which can burn a human being.
656000	659000	And then she's like, I wanted to sit there.
659000	661000	And then her parents, finally her parents come to the scene
661000	663000	and it goes, she thinks all the chairs are hers.
663000	665000	And I'm like, okay.
665000	666000	But in my head I'm thinking,
666000	667000	then take her in a fucking dark corner
667000	673000	and set her shit straight.
673000	675000	It's a chair by a fire.
675000	677000	They're associate pads.
677000	678000	Kids are associate pads.
678000	682000	Stop replicating and partying.
682000	684000	I'm going to do it.
684000	685000	The world needs more Dan Harmon's.
685000	686000	I'm going to make them.
686000	688000	I'm going to keep them in my ivory tower
688000	691000	and teach them to rule over you.
692000	695000	I'm going to show them dolls and say, this is what?
695000	696000	A normal person.
696000	697000	What's your job?
697000	699000	Control them.
699000	701000	I'm not going to make it your problem.
701000	704000	You will meet them at 16 when they emerge cross-legged,
704000	710000	floating.
710000	714000	And they're like lifting your cars with their magneto powers
714000	716000	because they'll come out and they'll be like,
716000	718000	I don't like bacon that much.
718000	719000	Fuck.
719000	721000	I fucked up.
721000	723000	What did I teach you?
723000	724000	All right.
724000	727000	I want to think quick before we bring out our special guests.
727000	729000	I wanted to do, you have your,
729000	731000	I have this text exchange with Rob all day.
731000	733000	I don't know if this will translate.
733000	737000	My friend Rob Schrab, who is a known,
737000	739000	yeah, you're a big fan of his
739000	742000	because he's a terrible person.
742000	745000	So here's a text exchange I had with him today.
745000	747000	You're going to read Rob's parts.
747000	748000	Okay.
748000	749000	I'll read my own parts.
749000	750000	Okay.
750000	752000	Is blue you or is white you?
752000	753000	Blue is me.
753000	754000	Okay.
754000	755000	All right.
755000	759000	I don't see color, but to me, white is everyone.
759000	761000	Oh, thank you.
761000	762000	You're welcome.
762000	764000	You just got to apply yourself.
764000	767000	That's my problem.
767000	768000	Yeah.
768000	771000	And later on, we have some lesbian women coming up,
771000	773000	but I don't even know that.
773000	776000	To me, they're just both white women.
776000	777000	I don't know.
777000	778000	I don't see sexual preference.
778000	781000	I just see that they're beautiful white women.
781000	783000	One of them might be Latin.
783000	784000	I don't know.
784000	786000	Her last name is Esposito.
786000	787000	She doesn't look super Latin.
787000	788000	Yeah.
788000	791000	Good for her.
791000	794000	All right.
794000	795000	All right.
795000	796000	So here we go.
796000	797000	I'll be Rob Schrab.
797000	798000	Okay.
798000	799000	So I get this text from Rob.
799000	802000	This is like what it's like to be his friend.
802000	805000	Have you ever seen all that jazz?
805000	806000	Out of nowhere.
806000	808000	Out of nowhere.
808000	811000	Once, when I was a kid.
811000	817000	It's a Bob Fosse biopic that Bob Fosse wrote and directed.
817000	819000	Yeah, I vaguely remember it.
819000	822000	Roy Scheider dies in the end.
822000	823000	I knew it was about Fosse,
823000	826000	but I didn't know he had a hand in the movie.
826000	832000	You should do make a movie like that.
832000	835000	Good idea.
835000	845000	You should call it all that jazz.
845000	851000	So if you have fantasies about me, I said, um.
851000	852000	Yeah, that's a separate text.
852000	855000	Um is its own text.
855000	862000	I feel like you kind of walked me down a path on that one.
862000	866000	You know, because you like Jizz.
866000	869000	And Jizz is still in caps.
869000	871000	He keeps capitalizing Jizz.
871000	874000	Like it's an Addams family member.
874000	880000	Because those are the only things that are capitalized.
880000	882000	You know, because you like Jizz.
882000	885000	I think I got it, yeah.
885000	890000	When's the last time you saw Rocky?
890000	894000	It's hours later.
894000	900000	I guess when I was younger, I don't know, 20?
900000	905000	You should make a movie like Rocky.
905000	909000	But base it off of your life.
909000	913000	Would it be called Cock?
913000	916000	Would that scan?
916000	921000	Smell butt.
921000	924000	What is that?
924000	928000	That sounds nothing like Rocky.
928000	929000	It has two syllables.
929000	932000	That's the only similarity.
932000	934000	I wasn't trying to.
934000	939000	Is that a requirement?
939000	942000	Well, it's a movie like Rocky, and it's about my life,
942000	944000	but the title reflects none of those facts.
944000	946000	Nobody looking for the movie will be able to find it,
946000	949000	and nobody that comes across the title will know if it's something
949000	952000	in which they'd be interested.
952000	955000	End of conversation.
955000	957000	He really did.
957000	960000	All that Jizz was quite a long walk.
960000	970000	Keep fantasizing about being friends with Rob Schwab if you want.
970000	974000	Why don't we bring out our guests?
974000	976000	They have a new feral audio podcast.
976000	978000	Is it a new feral audio podcast?
978000	980000	It's a feral audio podcast.
980000	982000	Why do you always like new things?
982000	984000	It's like that fucking three-year-old wandering around
984000	986000	digging her dirty hands into pies.
986000	989000	Maybe this has been a podcast for 60 years.
989000	991000	It's called Put Your Hands Together.
991000	997000	And they're also like recently accidentally virally noted
997000	1000000	for these BuzzFeed videos.
1000000	1002000	Ask a lesbian.
1002000	1006000	Well, at any rate, welcome Cameron Esposito and Rhea Butcher.
1006000	1014000	Hello.
1014000	1019000	Anywhere that makes you comfortable.
1019000	1020000	Hello.
1020000	1023000	Are you guys drinking folks?
1023000	1027000	Well, we're generally like not drinking folks,
1027000	1029000	which is totally weird for the comedy world.
1029000	1032000	I know that Rhea we talked about in the green room is
1032000	1037000	a remarkable breed of vegan.
1037000	1038000	Vegan or vegetarian?
1038000	1039000	Just vegetarian.
1039000	1043000	Even in the womb, your mother, even though you're from Akron, Ohio,
1043000	1047000	it's not like you're from like a bubble.
1047000	1050000	Like you're not from some Google bubble in space,
1050000	1052000	but your mom never ate meat.
1052000	1056000	So even in the womb, your body, your blood, none of it
1056000	1059000	has ever touched meat and you've just never eaten meat.
1059000	1060000	Never.
1060000	1061000	And look at you.
1061000	1065000	You're like a foxy Michael J Fox.
1065000	1071000	Michael J Foxy.
1072000	1076000	Your Twitter avatar is like you in the drawing of somebody made of you
1076000	1077000	in the orange vest.
1077000	1081000	I think it's my like Tumblr avatar or something, but yeah, it's me as Marty.
1081000	1083000	You're super into Back to the Future.
1083000	1085000	Super into Back to the Future.
1085000	1086000	Love it a lot.
1086000	1087000	Yeah.
1087000	1092000	You know, I watched Teen Wolf two days ago and I hadn't seen it in like 20 years.
1092000	1096000	Teen Wolf, he had Teen Wolf and Back to the Future the same year.
1096000	1097000	Yes.
1097000	1098000	Back to the Future was number one.
1098000	1099000	Teen Wolf was number two.
1099000	1101000	And he was on Family Ties.
1101000	1102000	Yes.
1102000	1107000	He was sleeping in his car in between Back to the Future and Family Ties
1107000	1110000	because he would go shoot Back to the Future at night
1110000	1113000	and then he would shoot Family Ties during the day.
1113000	1117000	Teen Wolf is a terrible movie.
1117000	1118000	Is it? Does it not hold up?
1118000	1119000	It's not great.
1119000	1124000	It's a guy turns into a werewolf and nothing happens.
1124000	1126000	I believe he's good at basketball.
1126000	1128000	That's nothing.
1128000	1131000	Just practice.
1131000	1133000	Get good at basketball.
1133000	1144000	But I remember it being about being yourself as opposed to falling back on the thing that makes you, I don't know, marketable.
1144000	1150000	Well, I also think it kind of came out at this time when the idea that somebody would be very good at sports wasn't really...
1150000	1157000	This is like a pre-Jordan era where we were like, they would have to be a wolf to be good at basketball.
1157000	1161000	If they're white, they'd have to be a wolf.
1161000	1167000	Something about that movie that really registered with me, I'm sure it doesn't hold up.
1167000	1172000	I'm informed and inspired by a bunch of crap that I watch it and it's like, this doesn't hold up.
1172000	1182000	But the really impacting thing creatively about Teen Wolf was that they were doing this traditional garbage-y 80s movie.
1182000	1185000	He's a wolf and blah, blah, blah.
1185000	1194000	And then there's that moment, the plot point where he turns into a werewolf on the basketball court and instead of going left, they go right.
1194000	1202000	It's just like some writer thought, what if he turned into a werewolf on the basketball court and then everyone went...
1202000	1209000	Or then he starts dribbling the basketball and it's like, if basketball is so fucking important to you,
1209000	1215000	you have to stop the game because I turned into a werewolf or you got to play basketball against a werewolf.
1215000	1217000	And then they just go right instead of left.
1217000	1224000	And the movie continues along the lines of like, what if being a werewolf was just a metaphor for being like, I don't know what, pick your...
1224000	1227000	Wow, that's a coming out story. I just realized that.
1227000	1238000	In a world where we still needed more movies about it being okay to be something, Teen Wolf was actually a cautionary tale sent from the past to today maybe for people going like,
1238000	1246000	Hey, lesbian. Hey, differently abled person. Hey, black person. Hey, like, don't let your superpower like...
1246000	1250000	Don't forget to just play basketball.
1250000	1253000	Yeah, when you guys came out, did you guys get really good at basketball?
1253000	1255000	I got really good at basketball.
1255000	1262000	I mean, I did get this haircut, which I feel like is probably pretty Teen Wolf informed.
1262000	1271000	Well, I feel like because I watched the movie Frozen last year on a plane and I was like alone watching this movie and I just hadn't read anything about it because I don't like to read about movies before I've seen them.
1271000	1276000	And I had no idea that that movie is just about a gay person. Like that movie is about a gay person.
1276000	1278000	She just wants to be left alone.
1278000	1284000	Well, she's just like, I have every... She's like, I have to hide who I am because my parents don't like me.
1284000	1288000	Also, men are terrible. Like that's a lot of what she says.
1288000	1289000	She's super gay.
1289000	1296000	She's super gay. She's like, got to wear gloves. That's part of being a lesbian all the time.
1296000	1304000	And I was like on a plane, just wanted to like make a friend so I could just be like, this is a gay movie for kids, you know, but I don't talk to people on planes.
1304000	1310000	There's a lot of other like Frozen though. You could you could interpret that a couple different ways. I never looked at that through a gay lens.
1310000	1312000	I look at everything through a gay lens.
1312000	1315000	Did you want a gay lens?
1315000	1317000	Yeah, I went to gay lens crafters.
1318000	1320000	I want to look at it.
1320000	1322000	It's not a tool. Oh my God.
1322000	1324000	The A team was...
1326000	1327000	Yeah.
1327000	1328000	The gay team.
1329000	1333000	Mr. T just wanted to fuck everybody, but he wasn't allowed to.
1334000	1336000	The that's not what being gay means.
1338000	1339000	Yeah.
1340000	1347000	Like early, you guys are too young. You're too young for Back to the Future even, aren't you? Like, what do you like? You seem like a youngster.
1347000	1349000	Maybe it's just the vegetarian and you're...
1349000	1351000	It's the vegetarian and the lesbianism.
1352000	1353000	She's 42.
1355000	1356000	It's a fountain of youth.
1356000	1368000	But the when we were doing the Community Christmas episode with the stop motion, we watched all the Rankin Bass stuff and I was stricken by the really kind of healthy super by our modern life.
1369000	1379000	The gay lens, progressive, thinly properly veiled, pro gay endorsement. That was the elf that just wanted to be... He wanted to be a dentist.
1380000	1382000	And he was like, I don't want to be an elf. I want to be a dentist.
1383000	1389000	They say I was born an elf, but I'm not. I was born a dentist. I want to take care of teeth and I want to do that stuff.
1390000	1391000	And he did a little dance.
1391000	1398000	He was like, wow, this is like really like like we don't have this much craft these days now that we're actually trying to accomplish this.
1398000	1402000	I mean, I really do. Like, what is Rudolph about? This is all these are all gay stories.
1403000	1404000	Everything is gay.
1405000	1406000	Jesus was gay.
1407000	1408000	Jesus was totally gay.
1408000	1409000	That's why they killed him.
1409000	1410000	Yeah.
1410000	1414000	Buddha was gay. Buddha was just a big gay bearer, you know.
1414000	1415000	What about Muhammad?
1417000	1418000	Say it into the camera.
1418000	1419000	Don't tell him. Don't tell him.
1421000	1422000	Say it into the camera.
1423000	1425000	Why is it always this camera for you?
1425000	1426000	I don't know.
1426000	1428000	Straight feed. Straight feed.
1428000	1430000	Yeah, it's going right to the headquarters.
1435000	1437000	It's the Camille Cam.
1438000	1443000	But like, for instance, Back to the Future, Superhole is up. That's a fucking great movie.
1443000	1444000	Yes, it is.
1444000	1446000	Teen Wolf is not.
1446000	1450000	And it reminds you that you were a dumb kid saying you didn't like bacon, but you liked Teen Wolf.
1451000	1460000	Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I don't want to hear your bullshit because there are people in this audience that will stick up for spaceballs, for God's sake, so fuck them.
1461000	1462000	But the truth is...
1462000	1464000	You just don't like movies with the word space in the title.
1464000	1466000	The truth is, Goonies doesn't even hold up.
1467000	1471000	Like the sacrosanct, whatever. Yeah, fuck off. Fuck off.
1472000	1476000	It doesn't hold up. It is not a movie. It is garbage.
1476000	1482000	It's a pile of spaghetti spilled out at your feet, asking you to figure it out.
1482000	1485000	It doesn't make any sense. Nothing.
1485000	1489000	When you set it next to Back to the Future, which is...
1490000	1491000	Oh, be very careful, motherfucker.
1491000	1496000	That movie, Back to the Future's screenplay, took seven years to write.
1496000	1498000	Like they were writing that for seven years.
1498000	1505000	And a couple of those years, I think in interviews I've read, Bob Gale was wrestling with what would happen
1505000	1508000	if in the car with the mom at the prom.
1508000	1513000	And you seem like you've probably delved into this stuff and read about this.
1513000	1514000	Absolutely.
1514000	1518000	But it was like... And at the end of it all, they realized...
1518000	1523000	It took them forever to come up with the simplest thing in the world, which is that the mom kisses the son.
1523000	1526000	And then she goes, I don't like it.
1526000	1528000	It's like kissing my brother.
1528000	1529000	It's like I'm kissing my brother.
1530000	1534000	Yeah, and it was like... That took years. They were stuck on that for years.
1534000	1541000	Yeah. I mean, they also wanted him to time travel in a refrigerator, which then showed up in Crystal Skull.
1541000	1542000	I'm sure all of you know.
1544000	1545000	But yeah, that screenplay is like...
1545000	1546000	This is good. Keep going.
1546000	1547000	She's got a lot.
1547000	1551000	It's like the tightest screenplay ever made. There's like not a wasted minute.
1551000	1553000	Oh, that's interesting.
1553000	1554000	What?
1554000	1556000	Because I think you forgot about the movie Alien.
1557000	1558000	You don't like Alien?
1558000	1560000	No, I love Alien.
1560000	1564000	We like Alien, but we're talking about tight screenplays, not a wasted shot.
1564000	1565000	Back to the future.
1567000	1569000	Alien was... Alien's a tight screenplay.
1569000	1570000	Tight screenplay.
1573000	1575000	But which one is more fun?
1575000	1578000	At the end, when Sigourney takes off her outfit and she's just wearing a tight screenplay.
1581000	1582000	That is a tight screenplay.
1582000	1584000	That's a tight... You can see everything.
1584000	1586000	All the... All the notes.
1586000	1587000	All the acts.
1587000	1588000	You can see all the acts.
1591000	1594000	I just keep thinking about all the arguments I have about what movie to watch with Aaron.
1594000	1596000	I want to be a lesbian so bad.
1597000	1600000	You guys are arguing about two different kinds of good movies.
1604000	1607000	When's the last time you saw Burton's Batman?
1607000	1609000	We were just watching it before we came over here.
1609000	1610000	I can't abide it.
1610000	1611000	You really?
1611000	1612000	Eh, garbage.
1612000	1613000	Oh, wow.
1616000	1617000	Garbage.
1618000	1619000	We were watching it.
1619000	1621000	We couldn't believe that it held up.
1621000	1625000	Actually, I'm going to say something very unpopular, which is that I don't like Chris...
1627000	1630000	I don't like Christopher Nolan's movies very much.
1631000	1632000	Wow.
1632000	1635000	Because I think he's like really...
1636000	1638000	He's just like... What is it?
1638000	1639000	What'd you say?
1639000	1640000	I wouldn't say awful.
1640000	1642000	Let's go with a more intelligent analysis.
1643000	1653000	I just think he thinks he's a pretty smart dude, and sometimes he wraps a pretty bow around a nonsense word.
1656000	1660000	So then I was a little disillusioned, and then I went back and watched...
1660000	1663000	We watched Burton's Batman, and I was like, oh, this is like an amazing movie.
1664000	1665000	It's very good.
1665000	1667000	I haven't watched it in a while.
1667000	1668000	I would've sort of tried...
1668000	1669000	Like in five or six years.
1669000	1670000	Oh, no, that's pretty amazing.
1670000	1671000	I'll watch it again with Aaron.
1671000	1672000	We'll check it out.
1672000	1675000	There is no way Tim Burton's Batman is better than The Dark Knight.
1677000	1681000	Well, we've got a live one here.
1683000	1685000	It depends on how you want to see your Batman.
1685000	1691000	Do you want to see a whiny guy that can't get his voice to come out right because he's trying to get over an accent?
1691000	1696000	Or do you want to see a dude who's pretty sweet to Kim Basinger the whole time?
1696000	1699000	He's like never that much of an ass.
1699000	1701000	He's just like, I got this whole other thing going on.
1701000	1702000	Yes or no?
1702000	1703000	Like, are you in or out?
1703000	1707000	And then she's like, I'm an adult person that's in control of myself.
1707000	1709000	And also, I'm in.
1709000	1714000	And then The Dark Knight's just like, God, my mother's so big I can't stop crying.
1715000	1716000	I think...
1716000	1717000	Are you...
1717000	1719000	Rhea, do you disagree with this stuff?
1719000	1721000	Are you a Christian Bale, like Batman fan?
1721000	1724000	Well, I enjoy The Dark Knight, but that's about it.
1724000	1727000	Like I'm definitely more of a Michael Keaton Batman.
1728000	1734000	I keep watching The Dark Knight over and over again because it's sort of like a Scorsese movie.
1736000	1742000	And I think that points to the guy is like a really powerful director, really powerful cinematographer,
1742000	1747000	and most importantly, what you can observe from everything laying around it.
1747000	1753000	Obviously, Heath Ledger is the thing that we're going back to, I think.
1753000	1758000	It's that plus the foundation that Christopher Nolan casts over everything.
1758000	1762000	I'll even, every once in a while, I'll be like, did I not get inception?
1762000	1763000	I'll just kind of be tempted.
1763000	1767000	And then you're like, oh no, he didn't get inception.
1767000	1772000	And it's like every time the logical part of my brain, the writer part of my brain goes,
1772000	1778000	this is insipid, this is garbage, but my eyeball part of my brain, which is never stimulated,
1778000	1780000	I'm always like, God damn it, it's so fucking good though.
1780000	1781000	Absolutely.
1781000	1782000	He's making gorgeous things.
1782000	1788000	But the problem is that, so The Matrix is a great example of making a beautiful movie
1788000	1790000	where they're like, oh, does this also make sense?
1790000	1793000	And I feel like for Christopher Nolan, if he was just like, hey, I'm a gorgeous artist,
1793000	1794000	I make gorgeous stuff.
1794000	1796000	I should get good screenplays and shoot them.
1796000	1797000	Yes, exactly.
1797000	1802000	I wish he wasn't always just like, guys, I got to explain why this is so pretty.
1802000	1803000	By writing it.
1803000	1804000	Yeah, got to go through it.
1804000	1806000	Get away from the typewriter.
1806000	1807000	That's all it is.
1807000	1811000	When's the last time you saw, okay, so then I would say this, absolutely Heath Ledger's
1811000	1816000	Joker's great, but we were really also enjoying Nicholson's Joker.
1816000	1818000	Just because it's like such a stretch for him.
1818000	1819000	It's very funny.
1819000	1820000	That's why I kind of want to watch it again.
1820000	1835000	Tim Burton, he's so theatrical and everything, I get distracted by, I feel like the crooked
1836000	1840000	doorways and the purples and everything, I feel distracted by them.
1840000	1842000	Everything's on a sound stage in a Batman.
1842000	1849000	That's what I really, I think that when Nolan did Batman, the thrilling thing was that
1849000	1854000	we were in genuine exteriors using locations and that things felt paramilitary.
1854000	1861000	The cosmetics made you, allowed you to believe in Batman in a visceral way.
1862000	1869000	You can see the dangers of Burton's Batman in, what's his name's Batman?
1869000	1871000	I refuse to say his name.
1871000	1872000	Shumacher.
1872000	1873000	Yes.
1873000	1874000	His name should not be spoken.
1874000	1877000	With the purple nipples and the day glow.
1877000	1878000	It's pretty rough.
1878000	1882000	It's kind of like, well, didn't Burton set you up to do this?
1882000	1884000	Isn't this what you liked?
1884000	1887000	When I watched Burton's Batman, I'm like, yeah, what are we doing?
1887000	1894000	We're like revving this fish shaped roller coaster car through a sound stage and having
1894000	1897000	these acrobats kick box each other and stuff.
1897000	1903000	Even Burton devolved from Burton in ways that people maybe should have, just stay with the
1903000	1906000	scissor hands and less with the other things.
1906000	1909000	Scissor hands with the guy like, yeah, all right, let's digress.
1909000	1912000	Oh, we lived in Chicago at the time, actually.
1912000	1916000	They filmed The Dark Knight, which is also interesting because that was very much a part,
1916000	1919000	I mean, nothing is well before that nothing was really filmed there.
1919000	1920000	Now they really encourage filming.
1920000	1921000	But like, did you ever see any?
1921000	1925000	I remember they would put up signs and they would say that a movie that was being filmed
1925000	1927000	there called First Kiss.
1927000	1928000	Rory's First Kiss.
1928000	1929000	Yes, that's right.
1929000	1930000	And it was Batman.
1930000	1935000	Yeah, because I actually worked at a screen printing company at the time that was making
1935000	1938000	like the emblems and stuff for the Gotham City police.
1938000	1942000	So they were making like in a robe for Harvey Dent, which never got made.
1942000	1944000	But yeah, it was all for Rory's First Kiss.
1945000	1949000	I worked on the street on LaSalle Street where they filmed the like final charge.
1949000	1951000	And they were and it was all labeled as Rory's First Kiss.
1951000	1954000	But there was like a Gotham City helicopter.
1956000	1957000	All right.
1957000	1960000	So I want to let you guys go because you have the birthday party to go to.
1960000	1962000	And I promise not to keep you.
1962000	1965000	But you're you're I'm not I'm not kicking you out yet.
1965000	1968000	But I want to do announce that because I'm terrible at letting people go.
1968000	1972000	You you have a podcast called Put Your Hands Together, which is like it's a stand up
1972000	1978000	podcast where you can come to see podcast people, comedian people do comic things.
1978000	1980000	You guys run it together and you're like hosting it.
1980000	1982000	I haven't lately.
1982000	1983000	Yes.
1983000	1984000	You're you're wrapping.
1984000	1985000	Go ahead.
1985000	1986000	Sorry.
1986000	1989000	It felt like you were trying to figure out what a show is.
1989000	1991000	Well, I'm not sure they have a.
1991000	1992000	You guys hosted.
1992000	1993000	Is it a format?
1993000	1997000	I don't know if the stand up come and talk about their lives on the thing.
1997000	2001000	And then or if it's a live podcast where you guys are hosting a stand up show.
2001000	2002000	It's all very.
2002000	2003000	It's a great.
2003000	2004000	It's a great question.
2004000	2005000	Yeah.
2005000	2006000	It's a show wrapped in a.
2006000	2008000	I just spilled so much water in my crotch.
2008000	2009000	Sorry.
2009000	2010000	So much.
2010000	2012000	It's all the way through.
2012000	2016000	But it's every Tuesday night at the UCB and it's a live stand up show that runs for 75
2016000	2017000	minutes.
2017000	2020480	And Ria and I co-host it and we do hilarious jokes.
2020480	2022960	And then also stand ups come and perform.
2022960	2026600	And we didn't think that this we took a real risk when we started two years ago because
2026600	2032120	we just said like maybe if we do this stand ups will let us use their material and most
2032120	2036040	of them do like we never we say you can have your set cut if you want it and we can do
2036040	2037540	an interview instead.
2037540	2038540	And that's also fine.
2038540	2041840	And sometimes you just get like a great interview with somebody who's about to go on Conan and
2041840	2043240	they're like practicing their Conan set.
2043240	2048760	But a lot of it is just like material which is awesome because there are so many people
2048760	2054420	that don't get a chance to be like I don't know if LA ever realizes how lucky LA is because
2054420	2057420	everybody just lives here so you can go to a show at the meltdown or at the UCB and it's
2057420	2062260	just like oh these people are only in like majorly big budgeted films not like enormously
2062260	2063260	big budget.
2063260	2067220	Like we can't believe it's just like Louis C.K. and not like Louis C.K. writing Jerry
2067220	2072600	Seinfeld like what are like this is bullshit like we can't believe we're just like not
2072600	2077380	watching Maria Bamford and also Sarah Silverman doing the arms for each other from behind like
2077380	2078380	this.
2078380	2084900	So you're spoiled audiences but people in Kansas City they don't get to hear eight great
2084900	2085900	comics on the same show.
2085900	2087180	They don't get to hear anything.
2087180	2088180	They don't get to hear anything.
2088180	2089180	They got no ears in Kansas City.
2089180	2090180	They got nothing out there.
2090180	2091180	Missouri and Kansas.
2091180	2092180	Sound free America.
2092180	2103860	And the thing that doesn't need to be plugged is the is these charming awesome like mother
2103860	2109860	friendly ask a lesbian is this video that's like billions and zillions of more views than
2109860	2114900	community has had and we were talking about in the green room like how does that happen
2114900	2115900	what does that happen.
2115900	2119860	I made a video called ask a lesbian and it's like pretty it's there's nothing really shocking
2119860	2120860	in there.
2120860	2123420	It's like here are the questions for ask a lesbian is scissoring a thing.
2123420	2124420	No not really.
2124420	2126820	Hey I've had this argument so many times.
2126820	2127820	Thank you.
2127820	2128820	It's not a thing.
2128820	2132740	Well you could have just called us whenever you had that argument.
2132740	2134420	I will come and call you.
2134420	2135420	Yes you can.
2135420	2136940	Give me the permission.
2136940	2140380	Weird question.
2140380	2144980	Not that I honestly want it to be a real thing but if you think about it scientifically it
2144980	2145980	doesn't make sense.
2145980	2147740	It's not doing anything for anybody.
2147740	2148740	Well now yes.
2148740	2151580	If you're a lesbian couple and you're out there and you want to scissor with each other.
2151580	2153500	I think also you guys would agree with me.
2153500	2154500	Go ahead.
2154500	2155500	Try it.
2155500	2157940	I have had women debate me after shows.
2157940	2158940	Like only a couple.
2158940	2162380	There's always like a couple lesbians that are like I do it and I love it.
2162380	2167780	And I don't believe them because you've been a lesbian for three weeks.
2167780	2168780	Yeah.
2168780	2169780	What are you rubbing.
2169780	2171780	It's so what's going on with your thighs.
2171780	2177740	You can get them so they always walk up to you really uncomfortable like oh it's totally
2177740	2178740	a thing.
2178740	2179820	They got no pants on.
2179820	2185260	They're just real Winnie the Pooh bow legged because the things you're trying to get to
2185260	2190860	align are very small in the grand scheme of things and you should just you should
2190860	2191860	just grab them.
2191860	2192860	Right.
2192860	2193860	I mean just grab them.
2193860	2194860	Like before you should rub them together.
2194860	2195860	You should just grab them.
2195860	2196860	Grab them.
2196860	2197860	Because gay men.
2197860	2203020	I doubt even gay men have a big flappy thing coming out and I bet I bet they spend very
2203020	2205020	little time just rubbing them together.
2205020	2206020	No.
2206020	2207020	Yeah.
2207020	2208020	And they can.
2208020	2209020	They can do it.
2209020	2210020	Yeah.
2210020	2214260	They could just like they could like tap them together and I bet they don't a lot.
2214260	2215260	Amazing.
2215260	2219060	Well I think that people are really confused about what lesbian sex looks like because
2219060	2223260	of like lesbian porn because lesbian porn is always like it's like two women scissoring
2223260	2226660	they have super long fingernails a pizza guy comes he's like do you want me and they're
2226660	2227660	like yes.
2227660	2231100	So then it's all labeled lesbian and it's just like very good.
2231100	2235340	Even the movie Blue is the Warmest Color has like 27 minutes of scissoring in it.
2235340	2240780	One question one question that you kind of sidestepped as a joke in your video.
2240780	2245780	I think it was like one of the first questions is do you get excited looking at your own
2245780	2246780	boobs.
2246780	2250020	Which is a question I never even thought to ask.
2250020	2252020	But you also sidestep it with a joke.
2252020	2253020	You did.
2253020	2254020	Is there an answer to that question.
2254020	2255020	Is that.
2255020	2256220	I'm going to guess.
2256220	2257220	No you don't.
2257220	2258220	Yeah.
2258220	2259220	Well not your own right.
2259220	2260220	You're not turned on.
2260220	2262180	You're probably like hey these are great boobs.
2262180	2264340	This is so great that someone else gets to enjoy them.
2264340	2265340	Or whatever.
2265340	2266340	Yeah.
2266340	2267340	You know.
2267340	2268340	The lesbians answer.
2268340	2269340	Go ahead.
2269980	2270980	Go ahead.
2270980	2271980	Well.
2271980	2273980	What do you want to answer first and all.
2273980	2274980	I mean.
2274980	2278500	Usually I you know look in the mirror and get full eye contact to the boobs and then
2278500	2281500	I'm like you're doing great buddy.
2281500	2282500	Well I think that.
2282500	2283500	So here's the thing.
2283500	2284500	I mean.
2284500	2287460	What don't answer.
2287460	2288460	Don't be stressed.
2288460	2289460	It's okay.
2289460	2290460	I'm comfy with my body.
2290460	2291460	Thank you so much for protecting us.
2291460	2294340	Because you were between two men who were like why are boobs like.
2294340	2296780	So I really appreciate that.
2297220	2298220	It's okay.
2298220	2299220	We're good friends with Kumail.
2299220	2300220	Dan's a great dude.
2300220	2301220	We're on.
2301220	2302220	It's okay.
2302220	2303220	Consent is given.
2303220	2304220	I'm curious though about that.
2304220	2305220	That outburst.
2305220	2306420	What could be gained by not answering.
2306420	2307860	What could possibly be happening.
2307860	2309820	And I really I don't mean that rhetorically.
2309820	2310820	What could be happening.
2310820	2311820	Are we bullying by asking.
2311820	2314900	No I think maybe it's just like you know any time you ask a woman about her bod there's
2314900	2316940	like a bit of a revelatory thing there.
2316940	2320440	But I mean to me I just say that no I don't get super turned on by my own bod.
2320440	2323460	But I do think sometimes I'm like oh you look great in them undies.
2323460	2330260	But um real tight screenplay.
2330260	2332980	I've never seen purple screenplays before.
2332980	2337180	That's a lacy screenplay.
2337180	2341820	I think young lady whoever felt compelled to be protective like that I want to be clear
2341820	2342820	about this.
2342820	2345580	I was asking because they made a video and that was one of the questions in the video.
2345580	2349180	I wasn't like hauling you guys up and like.
2349180	2351180	We got called up here from this.
2351180	2361340	I wanted to answer you know it's like the question was asked and answered in this viral
2361340	2364300	videos with human millions of people and I was like I wanted to do like a little director's
2364300	2366140	cut of it.
2366140	2370420	Is there is there an actual answer that questions I have like an even more personal answer which
2370420	2380460	is really probably too personal which is that Rhea has better boobs than I do.
2380460	2386740	I have great I have great boobs but I think she's got the better boobs but that's kind
2386740	2392220	of cool thing about being a lesbian is you're like you've got the boobs and I have a what
2392220	2404540	do I have the money say something a beautiful face a beautiful face you have a great ass
2404540	2415860	thank you for God's sake what about the whole I'm sorry the other question did you say what
2415860	2424420	about the whole yeah the other question I had never thought to ask until you guys told
2424420	2432900	me that you just recently got engaged or you got engaged last year and I think if you're
2432900	2437140	a straight guy in the audience you may you may suppress it because you live in Los Angeles
2437140	2442460	but there's probably an immediate question of like who proposed like how do you that
2442460	2446740	was my first question I was like here's a lesbian question who proposed and I don't
2446740	2451580	know where joke separates from reality but and I think the answer is you just don't but
2451580	2456940	the answer from you guys was that Rhea because she has shorter hair.
2457940	2466380	It's easier to kneel down oh yeah I can't say no well yeah Rhea proposed but that was
2466380	2474500	just because why was it you and not me do you know the hair yeah I feel like I want
2474500	2478980	I knew that I wanted to be with you but I was like too shy to do that and then we went
2478980	2482100	to this top of what we were in Griffith Park we're in the top of this beautiful mountain
2482100	2486460	and I like hiking Rhea hates hiking she woke me up early early in the morning was like let's
2486460	2490700	go for a hike and I just like didn't think anything was weird and also she didn't tell
2490700	2496620	me to like put on good clothes cuz so I was wearing garbage jean shorts I'm very much
2496620	2505740	and like a sun hat that goes all the way around yeah we had water bottles Rhea sat in gum
2505740	2512500	right before she sat in gum all over her ass and then and then a hawk flew by and then
2512500	2516220	she got down and proposed but the funny thing about getting proposed to at the top of my
2516220	2523340	mountain is that you never think about like now we have to go down we're up here we didn't
2523340	2530300	even have service we couldn't call anybody we said like we want to hike back down and
2530300	2533860	then get get clothes on and go to brunch like what do you want to do I got to change the
2533860	2539140	laundry yeah had you guys discussed before that you were gonna get married or was it
2539140	2544500	a total surprise like a lot of now nowadays I would think a lot of couples are like hey
2545260	2548980	we'll get married at some point like what did a conversation you guys had had I think
2548980	2554860	when we moved out here together that I just figured like like as long as as long as Rhea
2554860	2559500	doesn't move back to Chicago we're getting married that was kind of the thought in my
2559500	2564300	mind and then I had you guys talked about it I don't think we did I think we maybe talked
2564300	2570860	about it and like I'm gonna marry you in that way that's talking about that's talking about it yeah
2570860	2575940	I mean that could be the most devastating talking about it there is like we are in moments
2575940	2583060	of passion we're like I'm gonna be like oh shit I mean you know yeah you can't just change your
2583060	2589380	mind about that and yet sometimes it's something you really want to say all right well one more
2589380	2594340	thing you know what she called my dad oh yeah for real yeah I did not have the balls to do
2594340	2601900	that I did not my girlfriend's girlfriends my wife's girlfriend at the time her yeah I
2601900	2610340	should have yes I did I didn't I'll say this I didn't need it he was like I don't need to give
2610340	2614980	you this but I really appreciate you talking to me about it first before you did it which is the key
2614980	2628180	dad response dad can we get a dad transplant yeah I'll take one too he's a tiny Italian crying man
2628180	2633500	and I just knew that he would need to hear from Ria and so I just actually told her that like if

2812580	2818180	this limitless potential we never did find out what they thought of each other's whole
2818180	2826980	which they brought up I wish I wish I wish I wish we could have gotten to the bottom of
2826980	2836740	lesbianism as I call it as a as a as a lifestyle choice um what makes you choose it I forgot to
2836740	2846100	ask them that yeah why lesbianism yeah why not why not survivalism or uh doomsday prepping
2847060	2852660	it's like it's a hobby yeah you know some people collect stamps some people are lesbian
2854980	2864340	let's bring uh somebody out here who whose whose name I kind of changed recently uh my wife Erin
2864420	2876580	McGathey Harmon
2886820	2890260	hello do you get turned on by your boobs
2890500	2901620	um it was kind of loud backstage do I get turned on by my boobs yeah uh no it was a
2901620	2906340	callback and we can move on now maybe I should say yes maybe that sucks there yeah
2910740	2917380	and I look at him I'm like that's you and I'm like but they're like candies on uh on hills of
2918340	2923860	I often wonder when I get I I get out of the shower and I see myself in the mirror and I'm
2923860	2932020	just like what in the world who would ever why like I just look like you got out of the shower
2932020	2937540	this morning and I woke up to it to a naked man and I was like oh and I will admit most of my
2937540	2944420	sexual turn on in this was from the fact that I knew that you had just taken a shower I control
2944420	2953940	the market the bar is low yeah kumail's gonna look like Greg Louganis and he's got a swimmer's
2953940	2961300	body yeah the height of male attractiveness Greg Louganis all right I guess I just popped in my
2961300	2969380	head yeah but mostly known for having AIDS and being a gay diver I was I guess I guess I'm more
2969380	2975620	progressive than you guys I just see him as a fit man yeah he was just a hot bod to you so
2975620	2984020	progressive I'm definitely on the Tim Burton Batman in that camp okay and not mentioned
2984020	2992660	Danny DeVito as the penguin is that performance is so amazing dark night too dark no one all right
2993620	2996500	and why did they spell night wrong oh boy
2998980	3005780	rude it's like it's day and night I know there's no okay can I can I do can I do my impression of
3005780	3015540	my wife's uh uh uh this is me at the altar uh uh having spent a day and a half almost physically
3015540	3021540	nauseous like retching like thinking like I gotta I gotta write these vows I gotta memorize these
3021540	3027540	vows I gotta make these vows right and I gotta do them good and then here's my impression of my wife
3028260	3036260	the officiant goes like they've written their own vows erin you go first and erin goes uh well you
3036260	3046100	know what what she didn't write her vows she just improvised them but she was like you know I love
3046100	3051140	you and stuff but then she did have a highly choreographed dance and song no she did she
3052180	3057060	her love was her love was not uh up for debate like like yeah I just thought it was funny I
3057060	3060820	think I actually that came away from it thinking like you know what I think the writing of the
3060820	3066660	vows and the memorization of the vows is a thing maybe for the groom because I did I am thankful
3066660	3072100	looking back on it that I had something because otherwise I would have been melting down thinking
3072100	3076820	about the idea that I was getting married and instead I was melting down like a sixth grader
3076820	3082020	like about to go play Marco Polo in a play you know I was like memorizing my lines I was just
3082020	3087060	pacing back and forth I had something to focus on I was like I told you to cherish you know
3088260	3095460	like I gotta I gotta memorize these things and it kept me sane during a very crazy threshold yeah
3095460	3101780	yeah I was keeping the secret of that performance but like right before we got married when we did
3101780	3109060	our uh first look photo op I don't know if you and Emily did that no we uh went and got married
3109060	3114900	uh at a five fifty times no we have been married many times but we just went to like the what's
3114900	3120580	it called town hall what's it called the square the square yeah we went to the square got married
3120580	3127220	the pit yeah we we went down to the mosh pit got married yeah and then told my parents so we
3127220	3132900	didn't have like a like a what's the first look photograph they do a photographers now because
3134260	3139060	it's more it makes more sense to take pictures before the wedding than after the ceremony
3139700	3145060	you do a first quote unquote first look photograph that's supposed to take place of the
3145860	3150820	photos that you would get when the bride is first walking down the aisle so it's a very
3150820	3156980	staged thing where Dan's back is to me and I walk up and they're like all right Dan turn around
3156980	3162180	like before the wedding here's your bride and then there are a bunch of people taking pictures
3162180	3168260	of it but during that Dan was like so are you gonna are you gonna read your vows are you memorized
3168260	3178340	and I was like oh I I knew I'd forgotten something yeah uh I have not done that yet um I was very
3178340	3182340	focused on all the other details of the wedding and I also thought that I was going to be like
3182340	3188740	struck by some inspiration for my vows which I guess never happened I promised to dinosaur you
3193140	3197300	like there would be some news item that would come through you will be my big elephant
3198260	3201860	because we were at the natural history museum and there were dinosaurs and elephants everywhere
3201860	3206900	the the cat that fought off that dog that tried to kill that child yeah you can see it right now
3206900	3212740	on youtube I promised to not do that to you or to do that for you all right anyways
3213380	3217140	yeah we got married it was you thought you were usual suspects or wedding vows
3218980	3225380	yes uh your vows were great and it was it was good also because I had done that other thing
3225380	3232340	which is basically vows I sang uh a karaoke version of I'll stand by you while my bridesmaids
3232340	3239140	did a choreographed dance holding giant cardboard heads of Dan's face it was fine
3243460	3250020	that's good yeah and at our final rehearsal I was Dan was texting me um and I wasn't answering his
3250020	3255140	text because I was singing I'll stand by you and imagining this whole thing and he got very mad at
3255140	3259940	me because I wasn't returning his text and it's pretty ironic to not respond to someone because
3259940	3268980	you're too busy singing I'll stand for them yeah all right well uh the only thing left to do is
3268980	3287140	to bring up Spencer Cretin thank you thank you very much that was lovely applause and it made me
3287140	3293300	feel eight times more self-estimatious uh this will make you feel self-estimatious
3293300	3299220	yeah Spencer had his hair down at the wedding and you look like a fucking romance novel cover
3300980	3306580	I looked like maybe I might have had a cover or two something like 25 years ago or something
3307380	3314580	definitely past my prime romance novel coverman but I you know I also got some interesting text
3314580	3321620	from Rob Schwab earlier today oh wow I did I missed that yeah I did I did as well well
3321620	3328260	almost fill you in because this morning I got a text from Rob Schwab oh I mean this afternoon
3328260	3337140	have you seen all that jazz I I also got that yeah yeah yeah no that's so rudey text I thought
3337220	3342900	we were having a moment yeah you said no no of course not that's fucking yeah no
3344340	3349300	oh then he responds it's a Bob Fosse biopic that Bob Fosse wrote and directed
3352900	3358260	to which I responded is a good and he said yeah Harmon should make a movie like that
3358260	3373460	he's he's nothing if not consistent did he go on to tell you no I said you should tell
3373460	3379540	him that and then he didn't respond I'd like to read my text conversation with Rob Schwab yes
3379540	3384660	this is crazy he knew we had the show tonight so he like was like I will be part of the show now
3384660	3392420	maybe or maybe he like texted Spencer sincerely what Spencer said tell Dan and then he texted me
3393940	3402180	mine was 117 oh mine was 107 motherfucker oh damn damn hold on let me let me let's find this
3402180	3407380	because we can piece a whole story together can I uh I'm gonna read uh this is just like cereal
3407380	3416500	Rob says it is like that was no pay phone mine was it mine was at 12 52 pm oh
3417300	3423460	was that earlier than his yeah mine is mine is earlier than his mine is at 107 pm he was just
3423460	3432020	that excited by the way my Rob texts me have you have you ever seen all that jazz I say yeah but
3432020	3436660	not for a super long time and maybe not all the way through everyone's responding sincerely and
3436660	3445140	he's just eating it up he's just trying to get to all that jizz Rob says it's a Bob Fosse biopic
3447700	3452820	that Bob Fosse wrote and directed and I said yep I'm familiar
3455380	3458660	and then Dan and then Rob says uh Harmon should make a movie like that
3459460	3462740	and I said yeah I think he could write a really funny musical
3462740	3465380	and then Rob says you could call it all that just
3471140	3478020	but he never told you all that just no what what lines is he drawing what is he doing
3479220	3489140	because he was last so by then maybe he was already strangling her that's more cereal same
3489380	3499300	there what oh that's more cereal got it yeah yeah yeah um wow I'm really confused this is this new
3499300	3507060	thing I feel left out that I didn't get a text asking if I've seen all that jazz we can only
3507060	3513060	hope I feel embarrassed by how connected I felt to Rob during that conversation because I had
3513060	3516660	actually written a text and then deleted it because I was like this is too much where I was
3516660	3520980	like actually when I saw Book of Mormon I thought Dan would write a really great musical it's so good
3520980	3525780	that you're bringing this up and we should all encourage him to write a musical yeah jazz sounds
3525780	3535060	like jizz I think his online persona came out of the computer killed the real Rob and is now
3535060	3540100	fucking walking around talking to us and eating food and stuff it's it's like virtuosity he was
3540100	3548580	at your wedding his avatar shop was at my wedding he was my best man and shrub before
3548580	3554180	as we're about to walk down the aisle he's still holding the the best man's supposed to hold like
3554180	3560820	the rings and stuff he not only has both like ring boxes he's getting he was holding the bag
3560820	3566420	from the ring store I don't I've never been married before I don't know what he's supposed to do but
3566420	3571460	I know he's doing it wrong like he's he's going like what do I what do I do he's holding a bag
3571460	3579380	from a ring store with like just a bunch of shit in it I'm like give me that put the rings in your
3579380	3585620	pocket we had had a rehearsal but then during the wedding Rob was like and hearing that and just
3585620	3592420	like had to the two boxes of rings he's like I don't know and you don't know it's like why don't
3592500	3596820	you know no it's a wedding you can plan it you can rehearse it
3598180	3602980	all right very charming very Rob yeah it was a really great wedding I had a great time
3602980	3608020	that night Spencer you disappeared I was looking yeah you know anytime I go to a party I kind of
3608020	3613700	leave early so I didn't stay too long but I stayed you know as long as you stay through the vows
3613700	3619540	yeah what are you fucking kidding me that'd be monstrous okay what were the vows
3620260	3628820	uh Dan's uh dance came second they did and uh you know they were about ghost fighting
3628820	3635060	okay and fighting as a ghost and yeah I did vow that if I die before Aaron I will protect
3635060	3642820	her with ghost powers that was one of my many awesomely written vows and then I would if it
3642820	3647780	got too weird for her I would allow her to I would go away I would not haunt her second husband
3648580	3653380	I would just wait for her to die but then her second husband should fuck off because
3654420	3656580	our love is eternal you really killed at our wedding
3662260	3670100	both you guys did I was very I was very moved by your vows also like the whole experience of
3670100	3675940	walking down an aisle and seeing all these people you haven't seen in a long time and also like the
3675940	3684100	bride is like hidden before the wedding like you don't know who she's gonna be hanging up
3684100	3688420	upstairs while you were talking to our friends so walking down the aisle was like this very
3688420	3693700	weird Wizard of Oz moment yeah it was so weird and you were there and that was you it didn't
3693700	3697860	really stick it's like I get to walk walk around that's a very well yeah you hung out you you
3697860	3702260	was like saying hi to people in line yeah I get to like chat with people it's like it's it seems
3702260	3706980	a little unfair like the groom gets to just walk around like yep get married get married
3706980	3713540	because she wouldn't get married and meanwhile I was googling vows literally googling vow ideas
3715460	3720820	I thought that one more thing about the wedding because who cares except us um there I thought
3720820	3726020	that the uh I thought I anticipated that I would be unable to say my vows because I thought that
3726020	3729380	would be the height of the emotional point but you turned out you didn't give a shit
3730260	3736580	so I was killing and I was like this is great I'm killing um no the the once I was doing the vows
3736580	3741700	as far as it was like wasn't that hard to get through the the peak of the emotion for me was
3741700	3746420	when you were walking down the aisle and because our friend Matt Gourley was singing Daniel
3746420	3751540	Johnston's uh true love will find you in the end it was like everything was like very it was two
3751540	3756340	century overload I don't know anyways I was that I got it that was nice I got it all out of my system
3756340	3762820	then I was like Jesus fucking Christ and then and then the rest was like I killed as you said
3763380	3768580	all right um I have a quick I have a very obvious question does it any do things feel different
3769460	3774500	I feel I feel like I I'm now I finally get to mail it because I feel like I was
3776900	3783780	we were saving ourselves I feel like I feel like I was a bad I was like like being a single guy
3783860	3792180	it's like now I uh I don't know I feel like I feel like this makes more sense you know yeah yeah yeah
3793220	3800820	I uh yeah that resonates with me emotionally um and also you want to tell them about
3802020	3808260	the thing that happened in our sleep even unconsciously I sure um
3809060	3818420	um yeah this week you if I think um and maybe maybe you can attest to this as how long were
3818420	3825380	you guys engaged before you got married we just got married we we went to the pit
3826340	3829940	we went to the pit and got married and called my parents and were like hey I'm married you
3829940	3837300	want to meet my wife they said yes which is great that sounds that sounds great I think that like
3837380	3843700	the uh with us like with this engagement period and I'll just speak for myself like everything
3843700	3849940	was like what uh all right we're playing this this uh football game he's he's passing the
3849940	3854740	ball the certain way I don't know why I wanted to why would you pick football nothing about you
3854740	3859620	yeah why would you pick the thing you know nothing about I know I had 45 seconds today
3859620	3866660	where I thought I really liked soccer was it the only 45 seconds where a goal was scored during a
3867620	3875300	it was this moment when Shakira is singing and I love Shakira um there the world world soccer
3875300	3881620	world football was on and the teams are all soft drinks and one one guy this sounds like a dream
3881620	3890180	you had and my dad was naked from the waist down um they were playing they're playing
3890180	3892500	that's your go-to for what your dreams are like
3892500	3899060	because it's okay because it was a dream but it's also upsetting um
3900100	3902580	I actually do have a lot of dreams for my dad's like donald duck
3906580	3914260	anywho uh no no anywho no no rest of the night rest of the night is questions and answers
3914260	3920900	I have those dreams where like someone where my dad's dick is no but I've never dreamt of my dad's
3920980	3925220	dick I've only fenced sorry sorry
3927940	3934420	go ahead well goblin uh a la approves um I had a dream that Michael Jordan was trying to kill me
3935300	3935940	go ahead though
3938580	3945380	it's not important but there there were I uh I turned on the television and uh soccer was on
3946100	3952740	and the ball was going so fast and then and then someone like they kicked the ball
3952740	3956900	and then you know they pretend to be hurt all the time and this guy just fell back on his back and
3956900	3961300	I was like oh and then everybody on his team was like oh no and I was like this is really
3962020	3967140	it's great and crazy but then for like then the next 30 seconds I was like nope no no no
3969140	3974020	boring um I will say this to go back to an earlier question you had we got married and
3974020	3979220	then she was like I never got proposed to and so randomly a couple years later I proposed to her
3979220	3985220	after we've been married was it good what did you do for your proposal we were in montauk we were
3986260	3992340	just and I we were just staying at a hotel vacation that weekend and it was at night and
3992340	3997220	we were playing video games and I was like hey let's go for a walk at the beach and she's like
3997220	4004100	it's kind of cold and I was like no let's go for a walk on the fucking beach and so I forced her
4004100	4010420	out and it was kind of cold then I was like will you marry me and she was like yeah can we go back
4010420	4019300	inside yeah I heard you did bro come on there was a horrifying crab there when we were it was
4019300	4026980	the worst thing I've ever seen or just ugly it was ugly and big and like sideways walking like
4027700	4032260	it was a nightmare thing it was the the crab of your new life together
4033940	4039700	it will not always look pretty but it will be efficient and protected and it has a shell
4039700	4045300	walk sideways yeah I was talking aaron about I'm telling you tell them the story because if I tell
4045300	4054660	it it's not fun about what I apparently did in my sleep right so um this last week a few
4054660	4059620	nights ago I was saying I was leading up to just saying that like during the engagement
4059620	4065460	it like being married feels less stressful to me like it feels like oh cool yeah we
4065460	4072740	bought the house and now yep here we are and no way out falling apart but made my bed let's do it
4072740	4080260	yeah lock and load lock and load uh anyway a few nights ago Dan talks in his sleep pretty
4080260	4089940	frequently and a few nights ago uh was farting in his sleep and there were because and I'll just
4089940	4094180	help you this up because you are a noble knight
4097140	4103460	everyone knows why people fart but explain but more so for me because as the wedding approached
4103460	4108100	I was there was a certain point where I was like I'm not gonna lose any more weight by our wedding
4108100	4112100	I'm gonna look like a fat piece of shit in our photos so I just started eating a lot of ice cream
4113540	4118340	and I think I think I may be lactose intolerant every day for the
4120580	4124420	she lost 30 pounds in 30 days and at some point I was like fuck it
4127700	4133460	where Spencer was he having you get ice cream uh well not ice cream but yeah
4133460	4138820	very peanut butter and just anything on a corn cob butter shower I would have a shower
4138820	4144020	brought in with butter a lot I just I was not mad about you eating ice cream it's just hilarious
4144660	4149460	based on like you're coming home and me saying oh I really worked hard today you're like cool cool
4149460	4155540	cool me too yeah I didn't say I never said me too I just was like cool cool but meanwhile you were
4155540	4162180	eating ice cream ice cream the horror of foods so this is why you were farting in your sleep
4162180	4169540	so Dan Dan has farted in his sleep before um and has woken himself up and sometimes says
4171300	4174420	there there have been a couple occasions where he's farted in his sleep and then
4174420	4175460	turn over and been like what
4179300	4188580	what come on come on can we pull it together not an exaggeration it is sleep he talks to me like
4188580	4195220	I'm his second mate on a submarine and I am getting water in the boat and he's like let's
4196420	4197220	be professional
4200260	4211540	water in the boat yeah but a few nights ago Dan I think the most uh I'm going to say majestic
4212500	4220020	um but not in a way that I think is in a the grossest the most like triumphant beginning
4220020	4228500	of a symphony uh by Beethoven that's all horns fart happened for a very long comical time
4230100	4233860	I was awake and Dan was asleep and it was it was absurd
4233860	4243060	there were highs and lows there were like emotional like oh god will they oh okay good
4243060	4250900	they're safe in this fart and I knew that Dan was going to wake up that fart sounds like it
4250900	4263460	had more plot than Teen Wolf yeah absolutely yeah it was a steel magnolias fart um at the end of it
4263460	4268580	uh I was just looking at him because I thought he I knew he would wake up and he didn't open his
4268580	4278580	eyes and just said husband and that is that story if I told that story it wouldn't it'd be like what
4278580	4289300	are you bragging about yeah I don't know husband I'm assuming that was shame-based like I was like
4289300	4294340	I don't know like maybe in my dream I was looking at myself farting it was like yelling at myself
4295700	4300260	you had a great tack to that fart yeah you lost 30 pounds in 30 days
4305940	4307700	that's crazy kind of yeah
4310260	4318580	I'm keeping them a secret somewhere what did you do I did uh I did a like doctor
4319300	4323860	prescribed it's kind of embarrassing but I guess you don't have to talk about it I was just curious
4323860	4327780	no it's fine I um I ate a bunch of tapeworms
4330100	4336900	and then stared at pictures of Rebecca Gayhart from 1995 because that's what they had uh no I I
4336900	4341780	um I went to a doctor and I was prescribed this diet which is basically 500 calories a day
4342340	4350900	what yeah that's starvation that's you don't have to do it women it's not you don't have to I loved
4350900	4360820	her and never asked for any of this and and got fat to inspire her hoping she would catch on
4361540	4366980	we're getting married we can be fatter than ever a lot of it a lot of it was like that diet sounds
4366980	4373700	crazy no one could ever do that I should see if I could do that uh so yeah I think technically I
4373700	4380340	lost because I was losing weight because I was exercising a lot before the doctor prescribed
4380340	4386740	this this mattering of applause in this room is very confusing there's so many factions of people
4386740	4391940	there's the there's the lady that thinks that if I talk to lesbians about their boobs like the
4392660	4397460	prisoner is happening and then that but she's quiet well you're talking about losing 30 pounds
4397460	4405060	the exercise freaks in the back exercise is the way to go I think also 30 pounds sounds like
4405620	4414420	a lot I'm five ten so like 30 pounds on me like isn't as 30 pounds is it's a lot 500 calories a
4414420	4421220	day what did you eat like what did it look can I ask I don't know if there's interest yeah um I
4421220	4431060	didn't do it for the full time but like my day was uh an apple and then like a half a chicken breast
4431060	4439380	and vegetables the main thing was like having no additives and no fat was kind of the thing
4440500	4446740	you weren't allowed to wear oil-based makeup like the doctor that prescribed it it was a whole
4446900	4452980	doctor who prescribed it sounded exactly like Werner Herzog which was terrifying
4454420	4457940	this is not something to take lightly
4460420	4465220	I will give you this cautiously
4469700	4473060	you will look good but at what costs
4476740	4484260	I was into it because over the last year I've put on weight that I didn't want which is usually
4484260	4493140	the case and uh yeah I just wanted to lose it quickly but no matter what you're shaped like
4493140	4497540	you're a beautiful human being and you shouldn't let people convince you or worse yourself convince
4497540	4504900	you that the fact that you look how you look okay wait did I get her back yeah you got her back
4507140	4510420	your body does not define you am I getting this right
4513460	4518340	I know it's like I see pictures of myself and I'm skinny or fat and I'm like why the fuck did I
4518340	4523700	I wasn't happy back then either like like like like the shape of your body is a lot like money
4523700	4529220	like you'd be surprised how miserable you can be looking really good and and and how happy you can
4529220	4534020	be being really fat and like it's not like well however you look is how you look it's how you want
4534020	4540180	to look you look that way because you want to look that way I was over my threshold of feeling
4540180	4545460	comfortable we but I mean we we both get there but you and I are gonna be like we're gonna take
4545460	4550580	a journey together where we're like we're we're we're we're gonna we're gonna I mean our favorite
4550580	4558660	pastime is never gonna be hiking like like like we made I'm not ruling it out but you and you
4558660	4565140	and I are at our best when we are watching like a movie you know and there's probably some ice
4565140	4571220	cream involved and like like I don't want to like I don't I don't want to hinge our happiness and
4571220	4576500	how we look I want us to be happy and it's a roller coaster you know well I just I think from
4576500	4582740	where you're sitting like this diet that I did also I did not lose 20 or 30 pounds on the diet
4582740	4588180	less than that you told me at one point that you lost 30 pounds I was going by you yeah yeah I just
4588180	4593540	mean like where I'm at now but I was talking about like when I had started exercising really
4593540	4600580	hard the thing is like for like two months I was exercising so much and I just I just lost uh I
4600580	4606500	didn't lose a lot of weight and then I went to burn a hurt dog and he said you are healthy enough
4606500	4615220	but if you want to make this commitment there is an agreement you must make he gave me a physical
4615220	4618980	and during the physical which was terrifying I kept on asking him which I've never done with
4618980	4631620	a doctor before like is this safe safe it is a strange word capable of so much damage
4632580	4639620	I will not play the recording Nazi Germany was safe for the Nazis
4639620	4648340	this penguin's stomach is safe not for herring
4651060	4656340	but for the penguin he did say several times oh so tall
4656340	4660660	oh that does sound like a Nazi
4663300	4673780	so tall your skeleton so elongated so fireplace mental worthy what what
4675300	4681540	uh I was asking just because I stress a lot about what I eat and I like feel bad
4682260	4687220	about if I eat if I don't eat well and it's been like this since I was probably 14 like I've
4687220	4692820	worried about how much I weigh you know since then till today all the time were your parents
4692820	4698180	stressed out about your no they don't know no they didn't care which is good they shouldn't
4698180	4702820	but I don't think that came from when you were 14 I don't know but I remember eating fried chicken
4702820	4708740	ones and being like I am so horrible and it's still like that like if I and I love eating right
4708740	4714660	so if I eat something bad I like I get like really I feel really really horrible about it
4714660	4719620	and then it's like uh and it's it's just me it's on myself like you know it's not
4719620	4725940	nobody else has put any of this pressure on me but I like I heard a story I can't remember who
4725940	4730980	it was it was like some writer or something that mentioned running into you and they're like yeah
4730980	4735540	I ran into Kumail and I was talking to him for a while but he was like coming out of the gym
4736500	4741780	and it was I was really distracted by uh his immense upper body
4744500	4749860	that's the nicest thing I've ever heard like you you were just talking to them like oh it's so good
4749860	4758500	to see you all right we'll deal with that in a second okay bit from column a bit from column b
4759220	4766340	I I tried to launch into my Kumail I got the only I can't I can't I can't talk like Kumail okay
4767460	4772420	I always have to go to the word cunt I can't I can't do that I can't I can't
4773940	4782660	can you talk like Kumail I can't I can't you are um they uh they were distracted by how
4782660	4788260	overwhelmingly uh powerful and sexy your body was and they walked away from it affected and
4788260	4795380	disturbed that's the effect I'm going for there was one day when you came to nerd melt I think
4795380	4803380	before a harmontone show where everyone was like whoa what were you just you're fine no no I'm I
4803380	4809140	know it's fine I but it's just um it doesn't it's just myself yeah people don't we think about these
4809140	4814580	things we think about ourselves and oh oh I'm not I'm not good enough and we don't with our
4814580	4821620	friends I think we don't tend to say like well you know Kumail could really beef up no nobody cares
4821620	4828580	no nobody cares for yourself and your and your your arms are large and you've got that
4828580	4835460	neon muscle tea married neon muscle tea and there's a moment I was like wow
4835460	4842500	is that Spencer how do you feel about your body oh it's terrible it's just uh it's a real train
4842500	4849460	wreck over here I get up and I survey the damage and I'm like well we better get to work
4850820	4853700	but not to work fixing it to work doing my job
4858580	4860660	and then I get home from work and I'm tired
4860660	4866900	I wonder how to tell people I know for sure that people in the world are supposed to
4868100	4871940	they're supposed to hold themselves to a different standard than they're holding themselves
4871940	4876740	physically for sure but at the same time there's also a total acknowledgement of the fact that we
4876740	4883940	were a disgusting nation that kind of like we are definitely like we should keep ourselves healthy
4883940	4889060	and stuff that's a totally different thing from being sexy like like like like our standards of
4889380	4894100	what we look like and whether or not we're beautiful people like is totally different
4894100	4899540	from whether or not you are happy in yourself and like whether you feel good and it's hard to I
4899540	4904740	know I never I think I'm just generally obsessed with I'm just always conscious of like I look
4904740	4908340	like a piece of shit I'm a piece of shit I'm like piece of garbage on a piece of shit but then
4908340	4912420	there's moments where I'm like oh I really look like a piece of shit look at that I look like a
4912420	4916660	piece of shit I don't know it's never healthy it's never it never comes from a good place and it's
4916660	4925620	never like body dysmorphia what's up yeah yeah yeah with the with the me losing weight it wasn't
4925620	4934340	even it was like it really wasn't even related to the wedding it just seemed like a good time to
4934340	4941860	do it and I totally agree with you and I'm not uh I'm not trying I'm not aspiring to uh to be
4941860	4947300	like super thin because I don't think I'm comfortable super then I just wanted to feel
4948500	4956340	like uh I don't know like myself again like a like a sexy piece of shit all right yeah
4956340	4961060	we did it that's what we are two sexy pieces of shit we got married together forever
4962820	4967940	all right Spencer do you think what do you think what do I think about what's going on with you
4967940	4972340	dnd wise I just you know I don't know what you're saying man I don't know what you're trying to
4972340	4980980	allege here it's a lot a lot to process I don't do you want to play dnd I always want to play dnd
4987300	4993540	should I get it out like I am get it out I am Spencer got uh for the best man gift I guess
4993620	4998100	it's a tradition you get to bet your best man a gift I got rob a segue because he's directing a
4998100	5003940	lot of uh community episodes so I got him a segue so he could roll around the the lot and
5003940	5008580	spencer spencer took a day and he he made it look like scud the disposable assassin
5010340	5016740	so rob has like a little yellow robot thing now he can like roll around and write us all weird
5016740	5025460	texts about so rob's resting face is a segue face what do you mean no I expected everyone on stage
5025460	5032260	to be like yes yes no I mean like rob's resting face oh yeah he's got segue yeah he always looks
5032260	5039140	like he's on a segue yeah just like presumptuous but like I know this is stupid but yeah slightly
5039140	5046180	judgmental better than yeah yeah yeah to me rob shrub always looks like he's reacting to someone
5046180	5051620	unseen who's disapproving of him so that's almost the complete opposite of what you guys are talking
5051620	5056420	about like he's just always like he's shaking his head like someone anytime he walks into a room
5056420	5061540	like that segue face is defensive it's like I know that you've attacked me and I'm going to stand by my
5061540	5070580	segue segue so I so I was so jealous of his because I wrote around on his I got my own
5071620	5077060	you guys are racing it it was I don't have a car but I have a segue segues are awesome
5077860	5081780	I I've written one once and I had a great time do you write it on a tour
5082820	5086980	yeah kind of I was in Miami the worst place in America
5086980	5092100	okay no one who's been there can disagree with me
5094020	5098100	but they have all those shootings and all those clubs yeah I mean it's got a lot going for it
5101780	5106980	I segues are like rolling luggage to me it's the thing that on paper it's like this is perfect
5106980	5112980	this is what everyone needs but then you look at it and you're like I can't I can't cross that
5113060	5119460	threshold rolling luggage it's just like you look at it and you're like I can't cross that threshold
5119460	5125700	what is it like when you look at it you're just like I mean you know you see something and it's
5125700	5130820	like I it's like a fanny pack you know you just look at it and you're like yeah it's like you
5130820	5137460	can't you get it you get it completely but you're not going there you know he sounds like Margaret
5137460	5148020	joe I'm not going there she's not it's a fanny pack I agree with you walk around which yeah well
5148020	5150340	I mean I walk around sure yeah I love it
5153780	5160740	I've traveled with you uh you see you do we all do um you seem uncomfortable when you're
5160740	5167380	carrying your bag Dan also has a thing against rolling luggage I have a bag that I call 360
5167380	5174340	you get me a bag that has it's a double bag and then it transforms into a rollie and I slowly
5174340	5180900	started just rolling with it why don't you like rolling luggage I same as Spencer I looked at it
5180900	5187300	and I was like yeah that's the you're not gonna cross that way to describe it like but it you
5187300	5192180	know you get it that makes you like the cool kid in high school that makes kid makes fun of the kid
5192180	5199140	with a rolling bag yeah those kids were fucking lame that's what it comes from like you see those
5199140	5206180	kids and you kick their backpacks because it's like fuck you but in your mid 20s might not be
5206180	5211220	comfortable you don't have a bag well that's why I don't kick them anymore I just don't I don't partake
5215300	5221780	when you travel on a plane you have to have a rolling luggage you should do not you do not
5221860	5224660	it really makes your life so much easier agreed
5227220	5232580	well I don't know if that's true I mean it makes your life easier during certain specific stretches
5232580	5236900	but then you're exchanging that for like when you're looking at yourself in the mirror and you're
5236900	5242660	just no it's just okay sometimes like no it's fun also like if you're going down a ramp you can
5242660	5248260	let it go and you can be like who's gonna get there first you can play the who's gonna get
5248260	5256740	their first game you know that fun airport game thanks for making new character sheets oh yeah
5257700	5264180	you are committed to this what what is that yeah thank you that's a nice compliment
5265380	5271220	you're welcome I just figured out how to react to that just then I think if you could travel with
5271220	5276740	just a backpack you'd be the ultimate person which is what I try to do if I'm going to Miami for the
5276740	5282580	weekend I'll just put a couple underwear in a backpack and then I'm just like they go are you
5282580	5286820	checking I'm like what is anyone talking to me about anything for I got my shit on my back
5287540	5292180	no one can fuck with me ever then you say to your partner like where's the toothbrush and where's
5292180	5298580	the processing where's my underwear those all fit in a backpack though I mean it's like pants that
5298580	5303780	don't fit in a backpack and I don't talk like that and you married me
5304660	5310100	and if that's how that you married a monster and that makes that makes you worse than a monster
5310100	5317620	you're you're like the rancor keeper in return of the jedi like the rancor it was a grover it was a
5317620	5325540	grover voice yeah he did it to backpack what happened to my character why is elmo so popular
5326500	5333300	elmo's a baby elmo's a baby elmo's he's certainly not intelligent
5334980	5339060	he has a lot of problems understanding very basic concepts I've noticed
5339860	5346580	elmo's character is a bait like literally a baby yeah I know that explains why he's so dumb
5348100	5354740	does it show up any value for anybody anyone so it used to be like well it was a learning show
5354740	5360740	for kids and it and it and it differentiated with like the existing class system because it
5360740	5368020	the kids lived on the street sesame street the idea was it was a street and like it was like
5368020	5373380	brownstone steps and stuff it was like oh guess what this is where you live it was multi-ethnic
5373380	5378500	and it was like revolutionary teaching you to read cut to elmo that's some bullshit
5378500	5389700	it that show got caucusized I'll tell you that what turned into bullshit caucusized yeah I'll
5389700	5397780	figure it out later I'll write a blog about it I'll hashtag it what does caucusize mean look it up
5398660	5404900	like it's like whitewash don't look it up I made it up it means I've made it up did you grow up
5404900	5412260	a sesame street no see he's fine yeah we didn't get sesame street did you have an equivalent was
5412260	5419780	there like an educational Pakistani show that was no but there was a guy who would teach you how
5419780	5427140	to draw she lived next door yeah yeah I mean yeah he lived next door I'd go over to his house
5427140	5436820	teach me how to draw my parents hated him no before I went to school every day there would be
5436820	5440100	there would show one cartoon which was like Tom and Jerry or something and there would be a guy
5440100	5446020	who would teach you how to draw and he would he would pronounce the colors wrong like instead
5446020	5451300	of yellow he would call it Yulo he'd be like so and then kids would send in drawings and he would
5451300	5458900	just fucking rip him apart why that was our sesame street why haven't we been talking about
5458900	5466660	this for six years what did you talk like what were his critiques of the kids drawing very high
5466660	5471060	level like like you fucking heard the way he's like but there's no balance there's no perspective
5472580	5479060	the colors are all over the place and it's like a five-year-old drill it sent it in and he's like
5479140	5487140	and there's Yulo over here makes no sense that sounds so good so I would watch it and I loved
5487140	5492820	watching it when I was a kid I wanted to be a cartoonist but I was never good at it and I'll
5492820	5497220	tell you the day I quit I uh there was a girl I had a crush on this was the fifth grade and
5497220	5502260	so the art teachers really liked me and it was like if your drawing got an aid they would post
5502260	5506420	it up outside the classroom and I would always get an A because I was a good kid but I couldn't
5506420	5510740	draw so it'd be all these beautiful drawings and then one hideous one everyone was like why is that
5510740	5517220	there oh it's Camille he's a good kid but one time we had to draw our own hand and I couldn't
5517220	5520980	get it right I erased it and I drew it and I erased it and I drew it and then finally at the
5520980	5525860	end of class I went up to my teacher to show it like it's this good and it was it was her and
5525860	5530260	Sana Raza the girl I had a crush on in fifth grade and they both looked at this drawing and
5530260	5534500	they laughed and then they caught themselves like they felt really bad for it they were like oh
5535460	5543220	they felt really really horrible and uh that was the day I never spoke to Sana Raza again and I
5543220	5550180	decided I wouldn't be an artist I was really bad it's good yeah sonara was her name was her name
5550180	5560420	Sana Sana Raza you were born with a stencil what do you mean I mean on your body oh she's still
5560420	5566340	giving you shit for not drawing a hand right all these years later she's like why couldn't
5566340	5576340	you just draw a good hand don't stun a ruz on me um I would I was just bad at it I had a
5576340	5582980	comic strip I would draw called mr karate yeah I was wondering what your main route was so the
5582980	5588100	what could you explain the hero of that mr karate yeah he was a guy he knew karate
5590660	5600260	he had no choice his name was mr karate and uh and he would had a little radio and he would go
5600260	5607860	and then kick people's asses he had a little radio he would tune in for crimes yeah police scanner
5607860	5614740	no it was a two-way radio it was uh I yeah I just knew I could draw a box like so the radio was a
5614740	5621700	box and I could draw this one guy in profile so his fights were always in profile and I would draw
5621700	5630420	bandana and you were the villain just yeah it's like thieves and stuff nothing too high level how
5630420	5638820	old were you when you were drawing mr karate I probably quit uh I was probably like 11 or
5638820	5649460	something well too old I think to have dreams anyway I still can't draw all I can draw is a
5649460	5658100	ninja turtle I can draw inspector gadget pac-man and Garfield I could do pac-man not like I can

5812100	5818340	when we last met our heroes it just returned from underground finding themselves in an overgrown
5818340	5824340	tomb after teaming up with a ghost named lil baskins the gang trekked underground and pitched
5824340	5831380	darkness along the ghost way and then slaughtered a pair of rhinoceros for them their pelts but after
5831380	5838020	exiting the ghost way our gang was waylaid by a shoddily constructed ambush two gnolls swearing
5838020	5844020	vengeance for their fallen pack mate summoned skeletons and began to attack but dignity quickly
5844020	5850180	stymied the onslaught with some well-placed diplomacy after talking down the furry monsters
5850180	5855860	sharpie got to the bottom of their pain and after a fierce negotiation sold an ancient and
5855860	5862820	priceless artifact to the gnolls for 9 000 gold the gnolls slipped away with the mystical artifact
5862820	5868980	leaving our heroes alone in the cold but where would they go what would they do and how would
5868980	5875380	they keep from freezing to death find out now on an all-new harman town
5886260	5894340	I examine my surroundings I can examine my surroundings you are allowed to examine your
5895300	5901940	it's true it's true you stand in a small graveyard in the woods vines and kudzu coat the gravestones

5990820	6000420	but I told you so right yeah now we're dying little little baskets uh why is it so cold
6000980	6008020	because it's the north sorry it's the north hmm why did you know it was going to be cold
6008100	6012900	just because it was oh I'm a guide I should know stuff like that if there's going to be traffic or
6012900	6018420	can you can you guide us to a less cold place well not if the place you're going
6019060	6025140	that I'm guiding you to is in a colder place no okay can we where can we get pelts like is there
6025140	6030580	a place we can go to get pelts is this going to kill us this cold it will eventually okay it'll
6030580	6037780	get colder even okay great um is there a place we can get pelts before we move on what what
6037780	6042980	can we do uh I don't know I mean you could probably find someone who's selling pelts maybe
6042980	6050500	if there's any local uh you know furriers or uh you could hunt them yourself I mean there's
6050500	6057620	animals they exist we should go hunting yeah let's go hunting all right is he are you wearing a
6057620	6064980	belt I'm sorry I can't see no I'm a I'm a dead ghost that's the worst right got it
6067540	6070260	uh all right hunting montage
6073060	6078020	uh what kind of animals are about you know just uh squirrels and woodland creatures
6078020	6085140	it's gonna take a lot of fun are there are there woodland creatures such as bears
6085780	6090420	uh you know they're hibernating at this time of year really oh we could get them while they sleep
6092500	6098180	that's very true is there uh we can we head towards a cave or we know they're bear sleeping
6098180	6103620	uh I don't think no you don't just know if caves nearby with bears sleeping them they exist
6103620	6109460	you can try and look for such a cave I suppose I thought you were a guide I'm a guide I'm not a
6109460	6117460	cave spelunker we're gonna find a cave and build a fire and live and just live our life and possibly
6117460	6123940	repopulate society wait we have to form a new alphabet a new history I'm on board
6125540	6130020	let's do we can have a new religion I have a ring of thick skin I'm assuming that's
6130180	6137940	no you don't he might if if you do it just increases your armor class okay so I figured
6138660	6146660	I have an armament of autumn I can't make warm well it no it currently is autumn so you could
6146660	6157620	just make it now Avenger hey fly into the winter sky and see if you can spy a cavern
6158500	6167540	an opening we're looking for shelter cave all right let's do it he does that and he goes around
6167540	6176340	in the air and what he sees is a cave he comes down and tells you oh man the trees they stop
6176900	6183860	there's this cave where they stop fucking great let's go to the cave what do you guys think yeah
6183860	6189700	let's do it all right we're going to the cave he points he points in a direction with his little
6189700	6195220	claw how does he pull his wing does he play with his wing or his wing yeah with his wing
6195220	6201380	that is very cute I didn't know you could do that I yeah oh I take a mental picture can he give a
6201380	6207380	thumbs up with his wing no he doesn't have thumbs Avenger point over at that tree over there he he
6207380	6217940	does so adventure adventure point at crystalberg he he does I feel special I get him to point at you
6217940	6227300	it feels great hey hey hey Avenger uh pointed sharpie butts a lot he does so oh he's better every
6227300	6235540	time guy I mean you know familiars are generally animals they're much more intelligent than their
6235540	6241940	mundane counterparts he uh he said that familiars are are uh I'll tell you later
6243780	6250020	let's head let's head to that cave and so we don't freeze to death okay you do that you get to the
6250020	6257700	cave it's a small almost imperceptible deeper crack in a large rock you don't even know how
6257700	6263380	Avenger could have seen it from up there his eyes are so keen I suppose but it's just a crack
6264100	6269060	crack in the woods everybody hang back for a second I'm gonna mage light this shit
6270100	6278340	I mage light a rock and throw it into the cave can I do that like a road flare yeah you do that
6278340	6284020	and you throw it into the cave and it illuminates a larger space within that kind of takes a turn
6284020	6295860	to the right hello I'll handle this you uh you don't hear a response all right let's go in let's
6295860	6305380	go in we'll go in we all go in all right you all go in and what you see is uh is bears you just see
6306740	6312500	you see two bears they're nestled in dirt and grime you know I did my best
6312500	6319540	yeah you see your stone off maybe a couple feet away from them and it's just kind of
6319540	6323300	just kind of lurking my bear bear starts stirring one of them does
6325540	6332340	are we gonna kill these bears yes we have yeah for bad for goodness I take my
6333540	6341140	sword are there necks near each other uh no you want to do one swipe two bear heads no they're
6341140	6346660	kind of like like sleeping past each other you know like their head to foot of each other oh
6346660	6354980	they're 69ing uh yeah sure it's more like a leavening scissor are they scissoring no that'd be
6354980	6360740	that's not a thing bears don't scissor all right so I'm going to you have to be careful to get
6360740	6364180	the whole head off in one because it can't make any sound otherwise it's gonna wake the other one
6364740	6372580	you know the old expression uh let let sleeping beheaded bears lie
6373860	6378180	don't not no time at all yeah or they'll wake each other up and behead them quickly
6378180	6382900	and silently they'll wake I don't know why it's a thing it's not catchy at all
6384260	6385540	it kind of tapers off
6385540	6401540	I'm going to uh with my rope oh no I think you just cut the head off with the sword
6402820	6408660	well I'm just thinking that if I tie their necks together I can prevent against the other one
6409060	6416020	but once you cut the one's head off it's free again because then you see what I'm saying
6416020	6422340	no but if I tie both of their necks down while they're sleeping to rocks but why don't you just
6422340	6435860	kill them it makes sense but I I will take can I cut with two hands how amidextrous am I
6436500	6441140	I mean not super ambidextrous you're going for both at the same time I feel like this is folly
6441140	6445940	well yeah they if you're going to maybe one of you are away like the way they're next to a
6445940	6450500	position you'd have to be really stretching in both directions okay all right so I'm going to
6450500	6458180	I'm going to go to the to the more Walter Matthau looking one I'll go to the Jack Lemmon great I'll
6458180	6466180	take the carrot top is there a carrot top bear let's each take a bear is there a carrot top bear
6466820	6473620	no there's not any bears that remind you of historical why don't you why don't why don't
6473620	6478580	you just be ready in case something happens you should take a bear how many bears are there's
6478580	6482900	two bears there's two bears okay all right I'll supervise yeah okay sorry I didn't I didn't hear
6482900	6487940	there were two bears don't supervise you're going to security guard okay right okay so I go
6487940	6495460	to the grumpier looking bear all right I'm going to hold up my sword Chris do you want to yeah I
6495460	6499380	mean I have a short boy I have a ribbon dagger I have a poison dagger what do I use I should use
6499380	6511380	a poison dagger and just cut the head off yeah or in his eye no why into his brain all right maybe
6513780	6518900	what what do you think what do you think Sharpie you're supervising this I think these bears are
6518900	6529060	gonna die and I cast bear light no don't wake them up don't wake them up you cast bear life
6529060	6536900	why are you waking it's a light only detectable by bears why it wakes them up why I'm kidding I'm
6536900	6545780	kidding it's a it's a mage bit I won't wake up these bears I'm kidding you guys should have seen
6545780	6552580	your faces let's kill the bears just kill them kill them with your edged weapons all right so
6552580	6556980	I got my poison dagger at the bear's throat and she's got our sword at the bear's throat
6556980	6563620	you got three yeah okay well their throats are like on the ground yeah we're down by the
6563620	6568420	no like up against the ground like you can't have your you can't have your blade up against
6568420	6574020	their throats why not why can't we just because that'd be that'd be wedging between the throat
6574020	6580820	and dirt like that'd be like if I slit a dagger just across your throat no no because there's
6580820	6588020	a neck on the ground we could just we can hunch down by the neck he's the sides of the neck meat
6588100	6596820	that's not gonna kill anything uh what well if you can I get someone from the audience to lay down
6596820	6604500	face down oh they're face down yeah face down yeah all right so then I'm going to cut his neck
6604500	6609620	like this that's not the throat that's the neck okay that works you could do that you could do
6609620	6614420	that yeah I just want to cut off okay sure thank you thank you sir thank you thank you you could
6614420	6621460	do that sorry it's just oh the old neck versus throat debate they're different all right I have
6621460	6627940	my also the neck uh goes all the way around it sure does and the throat is a very specific part of
6627940	6634900	all right we put it into their necks okay great thank you Jesus this fucking guide okay I just
6634900	6640660	think it has to make sense you guys said throat man I well maybe we want to get to the throat
6640660	6646740	from the long way well you could do that definitely no we're getting yeah we'll start at the neck and
6646740	6656900	get to the throat all right okay so you count to three sharpie bear like no no no it's there's no
6656900	6662180	such spell you have nothing to worry about there's no such spell are you yelling that count to three
6662180	6668100	could wake the bear up you want me to count to three are you are you a bear what is your do you
6668420	6673220	ask around certain parts of town you might I will drop a handkerchief what do you want from me what
6673220	6678500	is this count to three and we'll get a count of three so we can cut there next at the same time
6679220	6685700	one okay we're doing it on three yeah okay let's go start over it goes it goes one two three bear
6685700	6693860	cut okay not one two bear cut okay yeah one two three bear cut one two bear cut no
6694420	6697300	oh fucking with you guys
6699140	6702580	oh you're bad when we get a chance to have a good time
6703620	6708180	we're always facing off of enemies that are bigger than us and there's some sleeping bears
6708180	6714100	we're adorable it's a little sad yeah I say if we can't do this and have a little fun all right
6714100	6720980	one wait hold on hold on I'm now I was standing up and yelling at you let me get back to my dagger
6720980	6727940	on the neck all right all right the neck right thank you throat yeah who gives a shit the dorsal
6727940	6736580	surface of the neck all right so bears don't sleep on our faces that's true you can't argue that
6736580	6745620	all right we're doing none of them hibernate one two remember it's on three but not it's three
6746420	6753540	bear cut bear cut yeah we got it one two three I have to kind of pay
6759700	6766820	all right yeah yeah I get the habit I'm trying to lose you you find a sleeping bear rather easily
6767300	6770740	easy to slaughter oh well that's sad oh
6774340	6777780	now I feel bad about it they're both they're dead oh yeah
6780340	6782500	gurgling while struggling to cuddle you
6785540	6793860	while looking for her cubs the exsanguinated mammals I don't what do you expect you just
6794340	6800020	you slit sleeping bear's throats I I cut the head and I take the head off
6800900	6804900	and I throw it up in the air and get under it so it lands on my own head like a crown
6806340	6809700	it it oh wait it does that
6811700	6820340	bear killer uh let's get warm that's your big line after killing the bear let's get warm
6821300	6828180	yeah things are heating up all right well well okay so do we know how to skin a bear
6828980	6835780	I'm just gonna uh can I just go for it I'm just gonna cut off the like an apple the skin
6838980	6839940	like in a spiral
6844980	6847540	it's like when you order a drink with a twist of bear
6847780	6857300	right no no no like if I was eating a blueberry pie but I was gluten-free I cut off the crust
6858420	6865060	but I used the I like that that got a more gross response than us that chopping a bear's
6865060	6870580	head off and wearing it as a crown that was fine but not eating the crust of a pie gross
6870580	6878820	uh monsters uh I should I'm gonna go down with my mage light and make sure the rest of the cave is
6878820	6884180	unoccupied oh it's a very shallow cave there's there's not really anything else to even explore
6885140	6890820	I uh I just take a moment to myself and I just go life
6893700	6900260	all right okay we start skinning the bears yeah dignity manages to cut off several
6901460	6908020	ragged chunks of pelt that can probably be stitched together or you know turned into clothes in some
6908020	6914100	way or just vomited on all right ha
6917700	6921460	oh you know what I just found out I remembered I'm allergic to bear pelt
6921460	6930580	fuck no I mean this is I mean it's not like we're not working for you I mean when I
6930580	6937380	we're gonna stay warmer we're gonna die what was that test the they they put a bear pelt on me
6937380	6943940	and it had a very bad reaction you want to stop find kangaroo like we get a okay so I'm not
6943940	6953620	allergic to kangaroo maybe you could just wear mud that's that's very harsh not nice I mean weird
6953620	6962580	twist like we'll we'll we'll we'll put on the bear and can you stitch I think so she starts
6962580	6969940	stitching the bear she doesn't have any stitches oh you're not you're not uh what's her name not
6969940	6976500	as far as I know yeah you're not what's her name I have thieves tools would they have like needles
6976500	6988020	and no okay I uh fuck well we're not going to be cold forever maybe can you stand between us with
6988020	6995220	a coat of mud to not be allergic well but I don't know how we're gonna stitch the bear pelt into
6995220	6999940	coats anyway well I was just thinking about cutting the bear pelt and then cutting like a
6999940	7006180	whole like a poncho oh yeah like a like a circular yeah two bear ponchos I'll take the stomach
7006180	7011940	and then you drape over like a christmas tree skirt yes and then a rope around the way so it
7011940	7016900	looks like sleeves oh you know how we fucked up if we hadn't cut the bear's head all the way off
7016900	7024980	we could have had like a hoodie with like the bear head that's fucking cool but we cut the
7024980	7032020	head all the way off we can ask baskins for to point us in the direction of more bears
7033300	7036180	oh baskins what are you doing oh I'm just hanging out
7037620	7047940	what are you doing uh we're looking for an ending trying to I'm pelting the bears to create a bear
7047940	7057540	for poncho that happens you do that you make two ponchos I remember my mother
7060980	7066100	it's uh it's uncomfortable that's good that's good keep going keep going that's the way
7066100	7068980	that's where the ending is she was a bear she was a bear
7068980	7078900	oh no she was a bear mom was a bear so you just remembered that your mom was a bear
7078900	7082900	so we're walking into this cave you're like where are the bears we can kill and now you recall
7084020	7090020	my dad so you're half bear I left my dad to somewhere bury didn't we leave my dad somewhere
7090020	7098020	admiral dark star um the shards of power uh your mom's a bear
7099860	7103140	your mom's like a bear worm people worm people yeah I made that one up
7106340	7107940	I found treasure I didn't
7110420	7117460	are you disgusted by us beheading these bears oh I'm so your mom your mom's friends they did
7117460	7124500	mahjong together all these bears uh I sit down and I start crying
7133860	7143220	I'm not gonna help figure out an ending I'm sitting here I I okay I sit down I start crying
7143940	7149300	and then I and then my tears fall down to the dirt and then I look at the pattern of tears
7150260	7158500	and it spells out the end do me continue nope you said you were gonna help I'm not gonna help
7159140	7167620	I notice that the rate of my tears and the distance of my tears stains on the
7168180	7174020	uh ground have a certain correlation that allows me to invent geometry
7179940	7183220	I I figure it out I'm not allowed to make a fishing pole
7185380	7186980	I invent geometry
7189380	7195620	no I mean geometry already exists at least fucking roll to see yeah at least roll to
7196420	7200820	geometry why don't you roll it's already invented okay who invented it circles and shit
7201540	7207300	you don't know it's not in the common history I you're not well educated but I'm I'm thinking
7207300	7212340	that I invented it in this moment but what yeah what does it not have do they have do they have
7212340	7216980	calculus do they have trigonometry what did they not have they don't have trigonometry
7216980	7221780	all right well they invent trigonometry well you don't know trigonometry to invent it
7222420	7228100	well but he no one can because it doesn't exist yet so he knows just as much as anybody else
7228100	7232580	he knows that it should exist that's more than most people all right explain trigonometry if
7232580	7239460	you know it's so bad okay say anything about trigonometry okay so you know geometry yeah like
7239460	7247860	three of those all right good night folks we'll see we'll see you next week
