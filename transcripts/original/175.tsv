0	11440	From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, and the nerdest, meltiest theater in the world,
11440	13440	Carment Town is now in session.
20440	22440	Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden, shall we? Spencer?
33440	35440	They love you, Spencer.
36440	38440	This song again?
38440	39440	How dare you?
39440	40440	Jesus.
40440	45440	Let's bring out the mayor of Harment Town. You know him. You might like him. Dan Herman.
48440	52440	Thank you very much. Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving.
55440	57440	Happy, happy Thanksgiving.
57440	70440	Unless you're Jewish, they, I think, around Thanksgiving, they pour them. Sure.
72440	80440	Kind of ruined whatever dumb bit I was about to do. There actually is a Jewish Thanksgiving in the vicinity.
80440	84440	Yeah, no, they're less thankful this time of year. That's the thing.
84440	89440	But they do it, they're thankful, they're a little bit thankful for eight days in a row.
90440	93440	They get a little, two ounces of stuffing every day.
94440	97440	Did you eat a lot over your Thanksgiving?
97440	99440	I had a little ham.
101440	103440	You're making a poopy face.
103440	105440	It's a De Niro face.
107440	109440	I had a little ham.
110440	111440	I was thankful.
111440	117440	The De Niro face you're making is De Niro's poopy face, though. It's where De Niro doesn't like ham.
117440	119440	The ham wasn't very good. It wasn't good ham.
119440	121440	Well, too salty, too dry? What was it?
121440	123440	I don't know. It was hammy.
123440	127440	Hey, ham, we've discussed this. Ham is not a real, it's silly. It's a silly meat.
128440	133440	We remember when I was going to go to Barcelona and you're like, oh, the ham, they're known for their ham.
133440	136440	I'm like, who's known for their ham? Ham's dumb.
137440	142440	And then I got off the plane and they're like, here's your ham, like, for real, in a bag, like, give me a bag of ham.
143440	145440	Barcelona ham never comes in a bag.
145440	153440	No, it was like sealed, like, artisanal ham. I don't know. Ham, ham shreds.
154440	159440	A guy named Arturo was supposed to cut it off a dried carcass hanging from the ceiling.
160440	162440	I know we're all very tired tonight.
163440	171440	It's been a long weekend. We've all, like, some of us have probably had encounters with family members that we didn't want to have.
172440	180440	Some of us, probably even the people that had a great time. I'm one of them, but, you know, there's an exhaustion level.
180440	184440	Did you speak to any, I know you weren't with your family, but did you speak to any of your family?
184440	186440	No.
187440	191440	My dad sent me a text, kind of making fun of me.
193440	204440	He said, I didn't really get his joke. What did he say? He said, it dawns on me that without a DNA test, you'd still be Irish, you'd still be married.
208440	209440	Wait, what?
210440	219440	I think he means, like, because I got that DNA test, and I always thought I was Irish, ancestrally, and Aaron was, very much so.
220440	228440	And I turned out to be British, more British than James Bond, and with zero Irish in me, and I think my dad is just referencing that.
229440	236440	He's just sending me a note on Thanksgiving to just say, maybe it's your fault that you aren't married.
237440	242440	If you were actually Irish, you would have made it work out of Irish solidarity?
243440	246440	Yeah, and that's the key with marriage, is you want to make it work.
248440	258440	If it's not working on its own, you want to put in effort, really. Just work on it. Just wrench away at it, like it's an old Camaro.
259440	262440	Because who wouldn't want to be in a marriage that had been made to work?
267440	271440	But you have to agree that all relationships have some work, like elements to it.
272440	275440	Of course, if you're in a partnership with someone, you have to make emotional bids and respond to them.
276440	281440	I know all this, I learned all this. It didn't help, but I learned it all.
283440	290440	I watched that new Mission Impossible movie, Rogue Nation. So, Jeff, you probably haven't seen it.
291440	292440	I'm guessing you watched this on a plane, right?
293440	296440	No, I watched it tonight. I was waiting for Fallout 4 to load.
300440	306440	I mean, it's not funny. It's a terrible addiction. It's going to cost Rick and Morty a lot of coin.
309440	312440	All I know about these Mission Impossible movies, I think I've seen one of them.
312440	320440	Okay, so this is like the seventh one. I hope I don't mind me spoiling it, but this one is like...
321440	324440	This one, the Mission is like, they can't do it.
325440	328440	No! But he's done six in a row, isn't he?
329440	333440	Well, there's always a little bit of a snafu, but this one is like, can't be done.
334440	337440	It's actually, that'd be a good Mission Impossible movie. Oh shit, it was impossible.
338440	341440	No, he gets up at the end and he's like...
342440	344440	It's on the poster.
345440	349440	And he says, look, six to seven isn't bad, and he just walks away.
350440	354440	I'm proud of him. He's been working really hard.
355440	357440	Babe Ruth only hits maybe two and a half, three out of ten.
358440	361440	Yeah, and it's not called, you can't hit the ball. It's called baseball.
362440	365440	His job is to go do things that can't be done.
366440	368440	But he does them all the time.
369440	372440	So he took one, this time he couldn't do it.
373440	377440	And I thought, I was refreshed. I was like, that's great, he couldn't do it.
378440	382440	That would make me come back to the Mission Impossible franchise if number seven...
383440	385440	Oh fuck it, that one was actually impossible.
386440	388440	You know, every once in a while the Mission is actually impossible.
388440	390440	The word still means something.
391440	394440	It's like the Harlem Globetrotters one time did lose to the generals.
395440	398440	That's on record. That's a reference for nobody here.
400440	409440	So there's a scene in Mission Impossible 9, whatever this is, where Ving Rhames keeps coming back.
410440	415440	Wait, that little snort you did sounded like when you hit Backspace on a computer, on a keyboard.
415440	418440	Do that again, can you make that again?
419440	424440	So Ving Rhames keeps coming back as the computer hacker that wears a hat.
425440	426440	His name is Luther.
427440	432440	And so there's a scene like in Grand Central Station or something, I don't know, some subway station.
433440	438440	The girls meeting with Tom Cruise and everyone's listening in their earpieces.
439440	442440	And then Tom Cruise is going, what about the hard drive?
442440	447440	What about the list of the hard drives with all the lists of all the hard drives on them?
448440	452440	And it's like, why did the Prime Minister want this thing? You're going to double down on the hard drive.
453440	457440	And she's like, what do you think? You're playing right into his hand with the hard drive.
458440	461440	You're going to make it, you're going to lose the list, that's all he wants.
462440	464440	Which character is this person? Who's that one?
465440	467440	She's like the femme fatale. Whose side is she on?
467440	471440	What is she on? Can she do missions?
472440	475440	We don't know. Like, am I six? Am I nine?
476440	479440	What's the CIA? We don't know what's going on. Everyone's wearing a mask.
480440	484440	And she's like, no, look out for that list. You're going to get that list for the guy.
485440	488440	And he's like, what if I don't get the list? And she's like, well, then he's going to kill you.
489440	490440	I'm going to have to blah, blah, blah.
491440	495440	And so then something happens and I go like, ow, ow, there's like a distraction.
496440	501440	And they take Simon Pegg, they kidnap him.
507440	511440	That was all women. All the women.
512440	513440	Well, he's adorable.
514440	515440	Yeah, he's adorable.
518440	521440	Might have been a couple of guys sounding like women, but that was all unanimous.
522440	524440	It might have been the woman inside a lot of men.
525440	527440	That's the sound I make when Simon Pegg gets kidnapped.
530440	532440	I don't know why I'm staring. There's nothing written on here.
537440	541440	There's something funny happening, like Simon Pegg gets kidnapped, and then it's a big crisis.
542440	544440	And Tom Cruise is like, ah, they took Simon Pegg.
545440	546440	And it's like, I'm going to go get him.
547440	553440	And then you, Jeremy Renner, you go get the list or the binoculars.
556440	558440	Who's another guy? There's another guy there.
561440	562440	Tom Scarritt.
563440	565440	Tom Scarritt, go buy some t-shirts.
566440	567440	We have a paper trailer. We were here.
569440	570440	So they're all scattering.
571440	574440	But then Tom Cruise says, Luther, stay with her.
575440	581440	So this girl is like a super karate, like she's like 25 and can fly.
582440	587440	That's her gimmick. If you try to shoot her, she'll be like inside your gun.
588440	591440	And then she's giving you the heim from inside your gun.
592440	593440	And then she hands you the gun.
594440	595440	And then she's like, maybe you want to kill me.
596440	598440	And then you try to get the gun again, but now it's backwards.
599440	600440	So you shoot yourself.
601440	602440	And she's just dancing all over the place.
603440	607440	And she just runs on your shoulders and just walking on your hat.
608440	610440	And she's in your hat. And then she's down in your pants.
611440	613440	And out your zipper and just slapping you.
614440	616440	She's MI-6. That's what they train them for that.
617440	619440	Except Simon Pegg is not trained for that.
620440	623440	It seems like inside the gun is the worst place to hide when someone's trying to shoot you.
624440	625440	You're overthinking it.
626440	632440	She's a fierce combatant. She's a young, agile, British lady with the grace of a ballerina
633440	643440	and the lethality of a New York cop on Labor Day.
646440	647440	I don't know.
648440	650440	I started like, why don't you riff something topical that's deadly?
651440	653440	And then I was like, don't. Just don't.
653440	658440	Don't. So she's like, spry.
659440	663440	I'm Chris goes, Luther, stay with her.
664440	666440	As in, keep her from going away.
667440	670440	Which is insane. I laughed out loud. I was like, Luther, stay with her.
671440	673440	Because he was like, he's on the other side of the thing.
674440	676440	Because she might be a threat if we take her eyes off her.
677440	679440	Well, yeah. She can't be allowed to get away.
680440	682440	By any means, no. Cannot let her go.
683440	685440	It's very important that she stay where she is.
686440	688440	So he puts Ving Rhames in charge of that.
689440	691440	It's just kind of, he's 90.
692440	694440	And he's 900 pounds.
695440	699440	And it's already funny that just him saying Luther, stay with her.
700440	702440	Because her gimmick is that she can walk on telephone wires.
703440	705440	But then they just do this thing.
706440	711440	They do this weirdly edited thing where I feel like Ving Rhames demanded this.
712440	716440	In his contract, when he saw the script, he's like, look, it says, Luther, stay with her.
717440	718440	And then she gets away.
719440	721440	Could we add a couple pages to the script?
722440	723440	I'd make an effort.
724440	726440	Yeah. It's like, she gets away.
727440	728440	But it wasn't my fault.
729440	730440	She's lucky she got away.
731440	732440	It's just this long shot.
733440	735440	It just keeps cutting back and forth between the girls sitting at a table.
736440	738440	Somebody's helping out.
738440	739440	All right.
740440	744440	The girls sitting at the table and it keeps cutting back and forth between her and Ving Rhames,
745440	747440	who's like, he's dog paddling through people.
748440	750440	All of these people are walking into him and he's just going,
755440	756440	and then it keeps cutting back to her.
757440	758440	And there's like five shots.
759440	760440	And she's sitting at a table.
761440	763440	And then they do a thing where he pans around somebody and then she's gone.
764440	765440	But he's a very large man.
765440	768440	And they shouldn't have left him in charge.
771440	773440	I told you, I don't have anything to talk about tonight.
774440	777440	Spencer, do you have any Thanksgiving festivities?
778440	779440	I've been fired.
780440	781440	Man, no, I'm fired.
782440	784440	Where is the goddamn fucking liquor?
785440	786440	Oh, shit.
787440	788440	And I got some other reprimands.
789440	792440	What the hell was that goddamn daft punk shit you were playing before the show?
795440	797440	You just goddamn emo.
798440	799440	Dustin Marshall, everybody.
800440	801440	That's Vernon Chapman from Wundershift.
802440	803440	Oh, okay. All right.
803440	804440	Hi, Rowded.
805440	808440	He's a very brilliant comedy writer.
809440	810440	It was who?
810440	811440	Vernon Chapman.
811440	813440	Oh, I love Vernon Chapman. That was his music?
813440	814440	Yeah.
816440	817440	Yeah.
817440	818440	I mean...
818440	820440	He's famous for his comedy.
821440	822440	And that was his music.
822440	823440	That was his music.
824440	827440	He also might be famous for being a really good guy that does music
827440	830440	that's not good to start a comedy show with before the thing.
831440	832440	He is awesome.
832440	834440	Vernon Chapman had one of my favorite openers of all time.
834440	835440	He came out on stage.
836440	838440	Vernon Chapman, if you don't know him, he's a very deadpan,
838440	840440	fantastic writer, great comic.
841440	843440	And he came out on stage at the Laugh Factory,
843440	844440	a plaza, plaza, plaza, plaza.
844440	846440	And he just looks at the crowd like totally deadpan.
846440	851440	He says, Stephen Hawking, sure, he can talk the talk.
852440	858440	And stood there for two minutes.
859440	862440	To absolutely no acclaim.
863440	865440	The Laugh Factory crowd was not with that joke at all.
865440	866440	Oh, really?
866440	868440	Oh, no. That's awful.
868440	869440	That was really funny.
869440	871440	Me and Fred Belford and Andy Kinlan in the background
871440	872440	shitting ourselves.
873440	874440	Okay.
874440	876440	All right, so there's one more thing written on here.
876440	877440	All right.
877440	879440	Now, I know I'm not going to garner any sympathy from those
879440	882440	God knows, not a Simon Pegg abduction level of.
883440	884440	Oh.
885440	888440	But I'm having a lot of trouble updating my iWatch software.
890440	892440	I thought you had forsaken the iWatch.
892440	893440	I had kind of thrown it.
893440	895440	I had thrown it in the garbage basically.
895440	897440	Like I threw it in like a duffel bag and forgot about it.
897440	900440	So now it's like now there's this new software for it.
900440	902440	So I was like, I'm going to put on the new software.
903440	905440	And I tried, but I can't do it.
905440	906440	And it won't work.
906440	907440	It keeps not working.
907440	910440	It keeps not installing the new software on the old watch.
910440	912440	And then I looked at the features.
912440	916440	It says in the iOS 2 for the watch,
917440	921440	one of the features that it fixes is, it says,
921440	924440	fixes an issue that could cause software updates to stall.
928440	929440	Ziggy.
933440	935440	So what's your stance on the iWatch now?
935440	938440	You're wearing this only because there was an update and you wanted to see what was what?
938440	939440	Well, yeah, I got excited about it.
939440	940440	Yeah.
940440	941440	I don't know.
941440	942440	I thought I'd give you another chance.
942440	944440	You little, you little fucker.
944440	946440	Can you, can you, can you talk to Siri on it?
946440	947440	Can you, can we have a conversation with her?
947440	949440	Hey Siri, Siri.
950440	951440	Hey Siri.
952440	953440	Siri.
953440	954440	Does she not do it?
955440	956440	Siri.
957440	959440	I checked your watch your phone now.
959440	960440	That's my phone.
961440	964440	Siri, Siri, help me turn on my watch.
966440	970440	Siri, can you turn on my watch?
971440	974440	Surprisingly, that is not within my capability.
977440	979440	Surprisingly indeed.
985440	989440	Dan, do you know that you can have Siri refer to you as whatever you want?
989440	991440	Yeah, I do. Yeah, I do.
992440	994440	What does Siri call you?
995440	998440	Hey Siri, what do you currently call me?
1000440	1001440	I can't answer that.
1003440	1005440	No, it's fine. We're among friends.
1008440	1009440	I'm sorry.
1011440	1014440	Siri, I would like you to call me by my name.
1016440	1018440	From now on, I'll call you by my name.
1021440	1025440	Ziggy.
1030440	1035440	Great. So now we'll never know that that erases what you used to be called.
1037440	1039440	Ask her what she used to call you.
1040440	1042440	Siri, what did you used to call me?
1044440	1046440	This is about you, not me.
1047440	1048440	Yes.
1049440	1050440	Precisely.
1051440	1056440	What's a surefire way to get her to say, like, what's something that she'll always say your name?
1057440	1060440	Siri, what's my name?
1062440	1064440	You're Dan, but you asked me to call you master.
1074440	1077440	Wait, let me see if I can get mine going here.
1079440	1082440	Siri, what's my name?
1084440	1085440	You're Jess.
1086440	1088440	Oh, sorry. It was not.
1089440	1090440	She's pouting.
1091440	1093440	Siri, what's my name?
1094440	1095440	You're Jess.
1096440	1097440	Why is it working?
1099440	1101440	All right. This has been the technology quarter.
1102440	1103440	Okay.
1104440	1105440	Last try. We can edit all this out.
1106440	1107440	Siri. Sorry.
1108440	1109440	Siri, what's my name?
1111440	1114440	You're Jess, but you asked me to call you ambassador of good times.
1116440	1117440	All right. Well, this is very troubling.
1118440	1120440	We're afraid they don't know a lot about each other.
1121440	1124440	Spencer, do you want to have Siri retitled you?
1125440	1130440	No, no. The only thing that I can contribute to this is that my good friend, Symphony,
1131440	1133440	which is a ridiculous name in the first place,
1134440	1138440	told her cell phone to call her Princess Kitten Nipples,
1139440	1142440	but it misheard her and thought it was she was saying,
1143440	1145440	Princess Spencer Crittenden Nipples.
1147440	1148440	So that's what it calls her.
1151440	1152440	Well, that's I'm changing my.
1156440	1160440	Siri, from now on, call me Princess Spencer Crittenden Nipples.
1161440	1162440	I don't know if it'll work.
1163440	1166440	From now on, I'll call you Princess Spencer Crittenden Nipples.
1167440	1168440	Well, there you go.
1169440	1172440	Wonderful. See, aren't you glad you came out through the parade traffic?
1175440	1177440	Hey, Nathan Bradford isn't here, is he?
1178440	1180440	No. I thought there was this guy on Twitter who was like,
1181440	1183440	I couldn't remember if he was coming here tonight.
1184440	1185440	He does beats.
1186440	1188440	I thought maybe he'd do a little beat boxing because he does his own beat boxing.
1189440	1190440	But he's not here?
1190440	1192440	We have a freelance beat boxer right here.
1193440	1197440	Well, I beat box too, but maybe a beat box battle.
1198440	1202440	I mean, maybe if things get a little slow.
1204440	1205440	All right.
1206440	1209440	We shouldn't do it on the heels of that hot Siri thing that we just did.
1210440	1219440	Let's do a let's do a segment called Ask Me Anything About My Mannequin Leg at Home.
1221440	1223440	Let's just do, let's just do questions.
1226440	1230440	You've heard references to me having a mannequin leg at home.
1231440	1237440	And now's your chance to get to the bottom of it with systematic questions.
1238440	1243440	Because I found out recently answering them makes me feel better about myself.
1245440	1246440	All right.
1247440	1248440	All right. What do you want to know?
1248440	1249440	Yes, sir.
1250440	1251440	Is it just a leg?
1252440	1253440	Yes, it's just a leg.
1254440	1255440	How many? Just one, madam.
1256440	1258440	I thought you said you have multiple mannequins.
1259440	1263440	I do have multiple mannequins, but this is not a question and answer session about my multiple mannequins.
1264440	1269440	I'm not offended by questions about my multiple mannequins, but I have recently bought two full mannequins.
1270440	1275440	One that lays supine and propped up on its elbows like it's like reading a book.
1275440	1282440	And then one that's like on its knees with its hands on its hips and its head back.
1283440	1286440	I'm assuming that's for like summer wear.
1287440	1292440	They're only like a hundred bucks and I got a couple, they don't really, they don't really work.
1293440	1294440	For what? For your knees?
1295440	1299440	I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought I could dress them up and like rub on them or something.
1300440	1301440	It doesn't work?
1302440	1303440	I like fully clothed women with agency.
1304440	1307440	So a mannequin would be right out then?
1308440	1310440	What do you mean, right out? Because they don't come fully clothed?
1311440	1312440	No, mannequins don't have agency.
1313440	1316440	Oh, well, I pretend they do. I project it onto them.
1317440	1320440	Like the way I dress them implies agency, like they're fancy.
1321440	1322440	And I'm just a schlub.
1323440	1324440	But you're saying it's not getting the job done for you?
1325440	1328440	It's just like a big, you know, it's like a stiff thing.
1328440	1330440	And, you know, you know, I already did the, did the real doll thing.
1331440	1333440	I just, I can't go down that road again.
1334440	1335440	It's just so sad when they die.
1340440	1346440	And also just this big crate, you know, and the guys that deliver the crate are so bummed out.
1347440	1350440	And you just want to tell them what's in there just to make their day, but you can't.
1351440	1352440	So they assume it's like just barbells or something.
1353440	1356440	Maybe they know, you know, but at any rate, they're going to take it up the stairs.
1357440	1359440	So you only had the one real doll back in the old days, right?
1360440	1360440	
1360440	1361440	You haven't got a second one yet.
1362440	1363440	No. So here's the thing.
1364440	1368440	All right. So the one, the mannequin leg, though, the one that I've had forever, it's this plastic.
1369440	1370440	I should have brought it.
1373440	1375440	But then you'd be like, that's a thing that you've come on.
1378440	1379440	Yes. It's a plastic.
1380440	1382440	It's specifically designed for the display of hosiery.
1383440	1385440	But it's like it's not so you don't even see him anymore.
1386440	1389440	I found I tracked this down at a warehouse like 15 years ago.
1390440	1396440	And there were two of them originally, Madam, an answer to your question back in the old apartment back in Hollywood.
1397440	1407440	Yes. I was back in the apartment in Hollywood and I found two like like like like plastic hollow, like life size woman's legs.
1408440	1410440	One's fully extended and the other's bent.
1411440	1413440	And then you you're supposed to have a store.
1418440	1424440	I don't. And then you're supposed to put like hosiery on him and say, look, look at how good this hosiery would look on your leg.
1425440	1430440	And and then I just but I went out to this warehouse and I like bottom and I was like, I want these.
1431440	1432440	And they're like, OK.
1433440	1435440	And I was like, it's for an exhibit.
1435440	1437440	And they're like, we didn't ask.
1439440	1441440	And I just I like I put.
1442440	1445440	I put Haynes silk reflections.
1446440	1447440	Pantyhose.
1448440	1449440	We have a hand up over here.
1449440	1450440	OK, sorry. Go ahead, ma'am. Yes.
1453440	1454440	No.
1454440	1456440	The question was, did I paint their toenails?
1456440	1457440	No, I did not.
1457440	1458440	Interesting.
1458440	1459440	Yes, sir.
1461440	1463440	What's the lifespan before they have to be replaced?
1466440	1470440	This is a guy who wants to know real practical information about this.
1470440	1472440	He wants to know when I put the pantyhose on them.
1472440	1475440	What's the lifespan before they have to be replaced?
1475440	1479440	How many users he knows, like how easily they get a run in them and right.
1480440	1483440	Or he wants to know, do I instantly come on them all the time?
1484440	1485440	And no, I don't.
1486440	1489440	I kind of I kind of do that as a little treat like like like.
1489440	1494440	I try to treat to whom?
1494440	1496440	To me.
1496440	1497440	OK, all right.
1498440	1504440	Typically, sir, I would say the average pair of hosiery that I would put up.
1504440	1505440	Oh, by the way, I'm down.
1505440	1507440	I lost the fully extended one.
1507440	1510440	Just go through like eight different relationships on each one.
1510440	1511440	The girlfriend says, what are these?
1511440	1517440	And then like over over time, they just sort of like like tiles on the space shuttle.
1517440	1519440	You're kind of like it's amazing that I still have this.
1519440	1521440	Like I have the one that takes up less space.
1521440	1524440	So it's like it's like the bent one, which is not the cooler one.
1525440	1527440	I really liked having both of them.
1527440	1529440	That mannequin existed before Aaron.
1530440	1531440	That was around you.
1531440	1532440	Oh, yeah. A million years ago.
1532440	1535440	And that was hidden around your place during this thing.
1535440	1536440	Well, not hidden.
1536440	1538440	I've never I'm not a dishonest man.
1538440	1542440	So if you move in with me, you find this thing and you go, what's going on?
1543440	1544440	Jeez, you guys.
1544440	1545440	I mean, what in the world?
1545440	1549440	You're they're so enthralled with the show, but they just want to talk about it.
1549440	1550440	Like, what are you doing?
1550440	1552440	I think there's just a kind of a.
1552440	1554440	Oh, no, but they're.
1554440	1558440	But before the thing came up, they're just no, they're they're bad people.
1559440	1561440	Who's being bad people right now?
1561440	1562440	No, no, no. All right.
1563440	1565440	I'll fucking sort them right out.
1567440	1571440	The I think I'm assuming the conversation is like, why does he why does he keep talking?
1571440	1572440	When's the show going to start?
1572440	1573440	OK.
1575440	1578440	Well, there's community around community.
1579440	1581440	I don't want to take a moment.
1581440	1582440	I don't want to.
1582440	1583440	Well, because he wants to.
1585440	1586440	I know you.
1586440	1588440	I just know you got ten dollars.
1589440	1592440	I think it's probably more like, honey, tell him about your mannequin.
1592440	1593440	I think it's like that.
1594440	1595440	Anyways, all right.
1595440	1596440	So OK, so you got that.
1596440	1599440	You got the old school man.
1599440	1601440	You bought new mannequins recently or no?
1601440	1603440	I bought new mannequins recently.
1603440	1611440	But the the the the old yeller, the old the old old faithful, the one that are the only thing that really works.
1611440	1612440	Why is it yellow?
1615440	1616440	Why do you call it that?
1616440	1617440	That's not yellow.
1617440	1618440	Oh, sure.
1618440	1620440	I think the answer is like, I don't know.
1620440	1622440	Let's say let's say let's say let's say a week.
1622440	1623440	Let's say a week and a half.
1623440	1624440	I don't know. OK.
1625440	1628440	Well, yeah, because here's what I do, because here's the question you're not answering.
1628440	1629440	What do you do?
1629440	1631440	I rub rub the toe on my nipple.
1635440	1636440	And I jerk off with the other hand.
1636440	1637440	Every time.
1637440	1638440	Without variation.
1638440	1639440	Every time.
1640440	1641440	Every every time.
1642440	1643440	Thank you.
1643440	1644440	Thank you.
1644440	1645440	Thank you.
1645440	1646440	Thank you.
1648440	1649440	Thank you.
1652440	1654440	I rub the toe on my nipple.
1656440	1657440	And then I come.
1658440	1659440	And then we get a half.
1659440	1662440	I come on the leg because I'm like.
1664440	1666440	I think a part of me is like, why are you doing this?
1666440	1667440	Stop it.
1667440	1671440	But is that is that 100 percent of the time that's always what happens or do you shake
1671440	1672440	it up?
1672440	1673440	Is there other things?
1673440	1674440	No.
1674440	1676440	One time you put a sharpie.
1676440	1677440	You came in the window.
1678440	1683440	I say is it every time you masturbate that that the toe and the nipple are happening
1683440	1686440	or are you saying it's the mannequin leg is involved.
1686440	1688440	There is a nipple toe rub happening.
1688440	1691440	Well I don't understand the difference between those two scenarios.
1691440	1692440	My question is.
1693440	1694440	No.
1694440	1695440	OK.
1695440	1696440	You masturbate a hundred times.
1696440	1697440	And I do.
1697440	1698440	A hundred.
1699440	1701440	A hundred of those are mannequin legs with toe rub.
1701440	1702440	No.
1702440	1703440	No.
1703440	1704440	No.
1704440	1705440	No.
1705440	1706440	No.
1706440	1707440	No.
1707440	1708440	No.
1708440	1709440	No.
1709440	1710440	No.
1710440	1711440	No.
1711440	1712440	No.
1712440	1713440	No.
1713440	1714440	No.
1714440	1715440	No.
1715440	1716440	No.
1716440	1717440	No.
1717440	1718440	No.
1718440	1719440	No.
1719440	1720440	No.
1720440	1721440	I don't know how you jog.
1721440	1722440	I want to know more about your special hat.
1722440	1725440	And this is like this is like you know.
1725440	1726440	No.
1726440	1729440	I believe me I can rub one out like it's just just enough.
1729440	1731440	Just with my mind alone.
1731440	1734440	So this is when you get into a certain mood you go.
1734440	1736440	Now is the time to take out the mannequin.
1736440	1738440	Put some Haynes reflective.
1738440	1739440	Yeah.
1739440	1740440	You get a little you get a little hankering.
1740440	1741440	Yeah.
1741440	1744440	Like I'm going to treat myself today.
1744440	1749440	But when that happens and when it's the mannequin leg and the hosiery and you're rubbing the
1749440	1754760	toe of the mannequin leg on your nipple and you're as you discussed earlier kneeling down
1754760	1755760	right.
1755760	1756760	Yeah.
1756760	1757760	I'm a kneeler.
1757760	1758760	Okay.
1758760	1761800	Is that is that solid gold does it work every time or sometimes you go fuck I'm not feeling
1761800	1762800	it today.
1762800	1763800	It's not working.
1763800	1764800	I didn't.
1764800	1771040	And they start yelling at the leg like elsewhere engine in deadwood.
1771040	1772440	What's wrong with you.
1772440	1773440	No.
1773440	1774440	I did.
1774440	1775440	It pretty much works.
1775440	1778000	I mean it's not like a button that makes it happen automatic.
1778000	1781600	I just think at this point it's probably kind of habit.
1781600	1782600	You know.
1782600	1785080	I'm not even sure.
1785080	1789680	I guess it feels I should paint the toenail but you know it has been suggested by the
1789680	1790680	bad person.
1790680	1791680	One of the bad people.
1791680	1792680	All right.
1792680	1795400	I'm glad you're invested though.
1795400	1796400	That's good.
1796400	1799400	I feel like they were invested to the point where they were murmuring like they were having
1799400	1801000	a sidebar about what you're talking.
1801000	1803040	Well obviously I'm a little vulnerable up here.
1803040	1806600	So if I hear people talking while I'm talking then I'm going to be like well if this can't
1806600	1807600	interest you.
1807600	1808600	What.
1808600	1809600	My God.
1809600	1813000	I'm like what else can I do.
1813000	1822480	It's like if as they drove the last nail into Jesus yeah I'll make the analogy.
1822480	1830920	It's as if like the last nail went in and then they're like your hand is so easily nailed
1830920	1831920	through.
1831920	1832920	You suck.
1832920	1835360	And he'd be like come on.
1835360	1837920	I've done enough.
1837920	1838920	It hurts.
1838920	1839920	I think it's a fair analogy.
1839920	1840920	Sorry say what.
1840920	1855800	Wait they can't get away they're they're inanimate but I have tried putting shoes on them but
1855800	1861880	the but the foot is like it's too I've tried I've tried to like get shoes and like put
1861880	1866240	them on to see if that would like maybe get me a little jazzed or something because I
1866240	1867240	could like take the shoe off.
1867240	1871760	But the guy that said that is your angle that like you're putting high heels on so they
1871760	1872760	can't get away.
1872760	1875240	But like what if he put like running shoes on them.
1875240	1879960	I think her angle was huh I think sporty sporty right.
1879960	1880960	Yeah.
1880960	1881960	Yeah I don't.
1881960	1882960	I'm not in the high heels by the way.
1882960	1883960	No.
1883960	1884960	I think we discussed that.
1884960	1885960	I don't get that.
1885960	1886960	I don't understand.
1886960	1887960	They're so high.
1887960	1892560	But what do you say you're you're just being glib.
1892560	1898280	Well I mean at your table is so small I know I feel so vulnerable on my right flank right
1898280	1899280	now.
1899280	1903040	It's it's a real strategic nightmare.
1903040	1906920	I mean I understand that I guess you know the repel borders.
1906920	1910320	I guess the idea is that your heels you're always on your tiptoes and when you're on
1910320	1912080	your tiptoes I guess your butt looks better.
1912080	1914800	I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't get it.
1914800	1919280	But we heard a guy yell out he doesn't like high heels either guys or gals or who doesn't
1919280	1920600	like high heels by applause.
1920600	1924680	They don't like those are the people that don't they don't like them.
1924680	1925680	Yeah.
1925680	1928840	Who is it or a plot if you're like a big if it really trips your trigger the high heel
1928840	1932080	thing.
1932080	1934760	But that's probably we should probably double that because some people just don't want if
1934760	1938280	they don't you don't want to like cheer because you feel like you're in a Bud Light commercial.
1938280	1941480	I'm going to double that applause.
1941480	1942480	Who's in the.
1942480	1951720	But more people in the butt plugs and high heels you know you can you can you can combine
1951720	1954120	those two.
1954120	1957800	All right so so I've opened up a little bit so I thought since it's Thanksgiving like
1957800	1962880	who who here is coming off of like a really particularly awkward Thanksgiving for any
1962880	1963880	particular reason.
1963880	1964880	All right.
1964880	1968840	That hand shot up in the mood.
1968840	1972440	Do you want to come up here and share your your bad Thanksgiving.
1972440	1973440	Awkward goat mower.
1973440	1974440	Here we come.
1974440	1975440	What's your name sir.

1980440	1981440	Gage.
1981440	1987800	Do me a favor face turn your butt toward the cameras and let's talk about what the terrible
1987800	1991440	catastrophe that happened to your pockets.
1991440	1997040	Is this by design or he was chased here by coyote and he just made it haven't you learned
1997040	1999520	Spencer's way to fend off wolves from all angles.
1999520	2001640	I'm getting a little bit better at it.
2001640	2005440	I happen to buy these pants like right before I went out to Joshua Tree and ended up like
2005440	2007160	sliding down a bunch of rocks.
2007160	2010360	Okay so I'm happily hearing that you did not buy these that way.
2010360	2011360	These actually.
2011360	2012360	Oh no no no.
2012360	2013360	This is real wear and tear.
2013360	2017000	This is real wear and tear like the day of purchase too.
2017000	2018000	Really.
2018000	2019000	Yeah.
2019000	2020000	So you go to Joshua Tree were you doing drugs and things out there in the desert.
2020000	2021000	Oh yeah.
2021000	2022000	What'd you do acid.
2022000	2023000	A little bit of LSD yeah.
2023000	2024000	Oh yeah.
2024000	2025000	How'd it go.
2025000	2026000	Fantastic.
2026000	2027000	Yeah.
2027000	2031280	So you just are sliding down those groovy rocks and you just it's hard to destroy denim.
2031280	2034280	You have to really do a lot of but you got to do a real number on them.
2034280	2035280	Yeah.
2035280	2036280	And you did.
2036280	2037280	Yeah.
2037280	2038280	All right.
2038280	2039280	Well that's why we love you Gage.
2039280	2040280	I did.
2040280	2044400	I did mushrooms up there and that their desert and just terrified the whole time that that
2044400	2047920	my girlfriend was going to die because she was running around like a goddamn maniac.
2047920	2049680	Look at the rocks.
2049680	2050680	They're alive.
2050680	2052280	I'm like motherfucker.
2052280	2055280	You're alive.
2055280	2057840	I'm freaking out.
2057840	2058840	Snakes out here.
2058840	2064280	Every every time I do mushrooms is like the gravity gets turned up to 11.
2064280	2070400	I could just picture I mean it's just like so like I just like it's the injury thing
2070400	2074280	like I just I can't I just pick it just so easily picture.
2074280	2076600	I'd say for some reason this isn't intentional.
2076600	2080800	I never I don't think I've ever been attracted to a I've never ended up in a relationship
2080800	2086960	with a with a with a I have to I don't want to insult anybody that I've been in a relationship
2086960	2093360	with but I they're typically very clumsy women like they're very very charming and
2093360	2097720	funny and smart and then like like like like almost always just like like extra like and
2097720	2103120	I just like I've spent my relationship terrified that they're going to I mean Erin like I we've
2103120	2106840	talked about this like she was just always like like making shit and then leaning out
2106840	2110240	windows and hanging it and then she'd go like I fell out the window while you were gone
2110240	2115440	and like it's just like just like I just I just like because I know I just don't feel
2115440	2119560	like I'm going to have the the the the capacity to deal with an injury.
2119560	2123360	I had to physically restrain my girlfriend this weekend from crawling inside a dumpster
2123360	2126960	with a family of raccoons.
2126960	2130400	We were she was crawling in a dumpster that already had a family of raccoons in it or
2130400	2135920	she had ganged up with a family of raccoons and she was like let's let's go storm that
2135920	2136920	news.
2136920	2140320	Yeah you should you should have stopped her from joining a family of raccoons.
2140320	2143600	She hadn't yet curried their favor that was my problem.
2143600	2149480	She was it was like an initiation she was getting jumped in by the by the by the Palm
2149480	2150480	Springs.
2150480	2154720	So what happened did she heed your warning or did she go did she go right ahead?
2154720	2159320	No that's why I had to physically restrain her no so we were we were up in Big Bear
2159320	2166120	for the week we took a week off and just went up and we also happened to have taken a little
2166120	2172040	bit of LSD and we're just hanging out and we we went down to our car to get something
2172040	2179560	and we we heard this like ruckus from inside this big metal cage of dumpsters and she's
2179560	2183960	like I think there's a bunch of rats right there I'm like no we got eight angry raccoons
2183960	2190200	staring right at us and she just crawls down to her knees and starts inching her way towards
2190200	2197440	them as they're like angrily bearing her down baby I know you think that you're about to
2197440	2203700	be accepted by a family of raccoons it's 4 a.m. and this is about to become everybody
2203700	2209080	else's problem yeah yeah yeah that's the thing about injuries yeah if you get all fucking
2209080	2213080	you fall off a rock and hit your head then you get to spend the rest of the night like
2213080	2220520	not before you know it how do I festering raccoon turn a kid on a head how do you she
2220760	2227400	she's so beautifully naive the world that she lives in is one where she could instantly
2227400	2233800	become friends with a family of angry raccoons well raccoons are deceptively adorable they
2233800	2240040	look they look adorable but they like they they they if you go near them they yeah they
2240040	2246200	cock their head at you and go stop yeah like they don't have any they eventually get bored
2246200	2251280	and walk away like they size you up are there any accounts of people being mauled or attacked
2251280	2255240	by well dogs like like that's why we did yeah because like like we had a raccoon coming
2255240	2260680	in our doggy door and at home and and then Aaron went online and like if you type dog
2260680	2267160	raccoon it's just fucking photo rolls of pictures of you know just because they got they got
2267160	2273520	like they're like monks in D&D they got little people hands yeah they got a little human
2273520	2276160	and they're not little people you know what else has a little people hands that aren't
2276160	2282720	people chimpanzees and look what they do they get in there they rip to your face eyeballs
2282720	2289280	and nuts the very next night we had like there was a like the same group of eight raccoons were
2289840	2296320	literally beating the shit out of each other outside of our door and making an insane you
2296320	2302560	think it was infighting like hey jerry uh that woman wanted to join our group you fucking
2302560	2308320	fleshed up on her and then it was like yeah all right so thanksgiving uh where where where
2308320	2313280	where did you spend it uh i did i did two separate ones i did one with my girlfriend's family and
2313280	2318560	then one with my family this is your girlfriend is played by reese witherspoon and you're vince

2335920	2345840	get out of here how dare you uh she uh she was a little taken aback my parents have gone through
2345840	2353280	a little bit of like a uh sexual renaissance since i've left the house and i've started hanging out
2353280	2363760	with a lot of very uh swingy type people and uh the whole the whole thanksgiving was uh was i think
2363760	2370400	pushing her boundaries a little bit uh wait so your parents were like like actively flirting
2370400	2378160	with other couples during thanksgiving uh yeah so they're so they're swinging the swingy couples
2378160	2382640	were there as well like like breaking the wishbones with them and uh-huh there's a lot
2382640	2388000	of ass grabbing and and crotch fondling really yeah like like like actual ass grabbing and
2388000	2393680	crotch fondling at like like in the in the middle of the thanksgiving preparation area uh
2396880	2398240	it's called the kitchen den yeah
2400480	2405920	but it's but but you ever cooked a turkey but i would be approved if i said in the kitchen
2406640	2412480	like but once a year that area is sacred i mean there's traffic there's kids could come through
2412480	2419680	with choo choo trains you don't you don't you don't run a choo choo train through ass grabbing
2419680	2426400	country if you're a kid you do they don't know no better um but kids have all moved out that's why
2426400	2431040	okay now we now gage brought things into this territory gage were you already hip to this you
2431040	2436240	knew this was already happening oh i've had my suspicions for a while i still haven't actually
2436240	2440640	like come out and ask like what's going on here but but you're pretty certain that's what's going
2440640	2445920	down oh yeah yeah yeah and so how are you with that you you can find with it you're cool yeah
2445920	2450320	your girlfriend who recently tried to befriend raccoons was like this is a bridge too far from
2451040	2453040	me
2454480	2456880	human contact seems very strange right now
2458880	2462640	raccoon sexuality whole different ball yeah they got little people here huh

2537200	2543840	both barrels well uh i just moved to los angeles from all the way in new york and i'm staying with
2543840	2549440	a friend's family and i just didn't know a single person it was just like yeah i'm just this 20
2549440	2555440	something dude who's eating all your turkey and drinking all of your beer and just being
2555440	2560880	that's fun though i did that that's good i like being the interloper it uh it definitely had its
2560880	2566400	benefits because i didn't have to talk to anyone but also you're constantly grateful which is what
2566400	2569680	you're supposed to be for thanksgiving and it's like it's a huge challenge to me in a normal
2569680	2575600	thanksgiving like when you're with your family and you're like uh i don't know i'm thankful i
2575600	2581280	i'm not dead yet i guess but uh but then you're like someone welcomes you and you're in their
2581280	2587120	home and you're like really i can have bread wow that's true that's true they were incredibly nice
2587120	2592960	but it's just like i didn't have any i didn't know if i had any common ground with them because it
2592960	2597120	was just like what am i going to talk about can't talk about politics that's always that's always
2597120	2604080	uh at at family gatherings yeah especially when there's an openly fascist presidential candidate
2604800	2611600	in the in the lead just go with religion that always works yeah yeah just talking about well
2611600	2617280	so i mean what's your saying are you do you do you have a little a little example a little taste
2617280	2625760	because so far gage has got a cooler name and like he's ass slapping you don't be gage i kind of
2625760	2630880	wish i was named paper bag now yeah yeah so so far gage is in the lead because his parents were
2630880	2635520	fondling other other people right that's also that's also hard to follow that's also hard to
2635520	2642560	follow i just had kind of entry-level entry-level awkwardness um peppered with oh my god it's not
2642560	2649680	snowing thank you thank you all right all right well let's try one more we got a hand over there
2649680	2656080	i think i got this i got the slap machine have warmed up now joker joker good good we also have
2656080	2663440	a okay good that's good come on stage all right is it good damn i was gonna say we have a gender
2663440	2671920	balance now but now 40 of the time you say oh we have a gender balance and then you go
2671920	2676800	hi my name is mike and i like like like like now i'm offended and you're microaggressing me and
2676800	2681360	um the but but what's your name my name is heather heather okay thank you heather what's
2681360	2685680	uh what was your what was your thanksgiving about so i've been in l.a almost three years
2685680	2691920	and um originally from outside of atlanta and um my family is uh i don't know like one of the
2691920	2697280	reasons why i'm drawn to harmontown i think is uh we we don't know how to say we love each other
2697360	2702960	or you know just general manifesting the fact that like we're okay with each other in the world
2702960	2708800	and uh so i haven't talked to my family for like a couple months because i only try to call them on
2708800	2714960	the the holidays and the expectations and stuff like that so i actually sent out a facebook
2714960	2719920	message like basically like a plea for help like hey i'm sad and alone in l.a and who wants to
2719920	2725840	invite me to thanksgiving and gratefully uh some people actually invited me here and i had a really
2725840	2732480	really lovely time invited you to l.a to meltdown oh okay had uh thanksgiving here at lockdown oh

2779040	2786160	that apparently my sister's not talking to me but i don't know why uh and um i found out because i
2786160	2791840	wanted to compliment her on her hair stuff has she paid her phone bill recently uh who knows

3032320	3036800	on your shoulders because i know how fucking much that sucks right that's the beautiful thing is
3036800	3041520	you know how you would receive that if i said that to you so then that makes me know that you're
3041520	3047680	yeah that's then it makes it fine yeah yeah that's nice what do you what do you what do you
3047680	3050400	what are you into
3054080	3060080	you like die hard or like my tender profile or something uh you know like i'm into comedy
3060080	3067040	and i like cartoons and um you know uh drawing and stuff and are you an artist
3068480	3074880	i'm trying to get better at saying yes to that question uh because it's like i grew up in a
3074880	3078480	geography in a time where that wasn't a real thing that you went out and did
3079440	3084080	and i'm not professionally an artist like i don't make money as an artist but i create
3085440	3093520	no i mean once upon a time yeah like i like in a dream world yes but um i mean realistically at
3093520	3101520	this stage in my life like i'm paying my bills and i i'm making it as like can you draw are you
3101520	3105200	do you think you're kind of good at drawing i'm kind of good at drawing yeah what do you
3105200	3108320	what do you like to draw when you like you like do you doodle when you're like on the phone and
3108320	3114480	stuff or are you doodle like like compulsively like some people do i'm not compulsive like some
3114480	3118400	people uh and i know what you're talking about like like that kind of like i i'm jealous of
3118400	3124000	those people who like like need to be drawing yeah that's one of the reasons why i told you
3124080	3126000	i wasn't um i'm just gonna do that
3129360	3133360	but that's one of the reasons why i thought maybe i'm not an artist
3133360	3136800	because i had somebody say that to me once like well if you can if you can just get through the
3136800	3140240	day and you don't have to draw then you're not yeah fuck that shit no that's that's that's a
3140240	3143760	horrible thing it's like okay maybe i'm not an artist but like you you have a Mickey mouse in
3143760	3147840	your shirt like a lot of our friends are are are drawy types and i don't think that they would
3147840	3151920	ever walk on the street and say hi i'm an artist some might and some might not but i think a lot
3151920	3159040	of our friends like uh whether they be animators or actors or musicians or whatever would would be
3159040	3163840	very bashful about saying that they're artists i talked to this guy i talked to a photographer
3163840	3167840	uh over the weekend who i met it was a very interesting conversation because i'm not a
3167840	3172560	visual person at all i was like i was always interested to talk to like artists and photographers
3172560	3180080	and stuff um uh the and he was talking late into the night as the as the booze hit and the
3180560	3186880	the you know things got headier and deeper and sadder uh he started talking about how you know
3186880	3193040	there's all these things he wants to do with his photography but like every like every once in a
3193040	3197760	while he's he's like oh my god i'm the worst fucking hack in the world i suck i'm the worst
3197760	3203520	i'm like a joke it's incredible that i ever took myself seriously i'm a fucking nuisance on society
3203520	3209520	and then and then the next day he'll be like oh wow i'm i'm i'm actually really good i'm great
3209600	3216880	and and and i was like i you know that's like a piston going up and down like you don't want to
3216880	3222000	be somebody who's just like even keeled about what they do if you're a creative like you want to be
3222560	3227680	frankly bipolar like you like like whatever no offense to bipolar people but i mean like you
3227680	3233360	want to be literally have two poles because that's what an engine has okay it's exploding one minute
3233360	3237920	and then it's not exploding the next minute it's like and that's why the car goes vroom vroom you
3237920	3246720	know no for sure uh i ended up talking to um it's one of my friends she's my ex um who i i realized
3246720	3250640	this week maybe that's the function of an ex is like because i've heard you tell stories about how
3250640	3255280	you're friends with some of your exes or that you at least all of them yeah like i'm starting to
3255280	3260240	realize like what a wonderful thing that is in your life because these are people that know you
3260240	3266640	so well and can say anything to you now because you don't have anything left to lose yeah and so
3267520	3272240	i don't know i was just kind of telling her about my shitty emotional reaction to thanksgiving and
3272240	3278560	her point was uh a when have they said that they're proud of you ever like why do you keep
3278560	3283760	expecting to hear that because that's never something that's happened you know it's just
3283760	3287440	not like they love you but it's just they're never going to say it in the words that you
3287440	3294080	want to hear and then b would you be the ambitious creative person you are if they had
3294960	3299680	manifest this love in the way that you want it to be manifest right and i was like additional love
3299680	3306880	pretty good pretty good for creative people i think yeah i mean i don't want to i don't want to
3306880	3311600	you know i'm sure there's there i also meet a lot of people that seem really talented and they're
3311600	3316000	like oh i love my parents functional and i know i'm jealous of those people but it makes me feel
3316000	3324640	better like heather we're giving camera wise could you just move down closer to den sure so
3324640	3332160	we can get you guys on a sexy two shot um all right so all right well okay there's two things
3332160	3339680	we can do we'll do them in this order so do you want to try an exercise that my therapist did with
3339680	3346000	me once sure okay it might make you cry though all right okay but i'm probably not that good
3347200	3355200	she spent years of training but i'm good at crying so all right so okay so so imagine yourself
3356160	3360560	maybe it might help if you close your eyes should we all be doing this or just just well no you can
3360560	3367200	participate i guess but if you all talk at the same time that'll be weird um you know like when
3367200	3370400	tom cruise has to hold his breath for three minutes y'all kind of hold your breath yeah it's
3370400	3374160	like like then halfway through it you're like okay and then you just watch the rest of the movie
3375760	3382560	um the uh the the i never even i hold i always hope my breath is like or before the guy goes
3382560	3386880	into the water because i was like and i still can't even make that gap because he's like you
3386880	3393280	got three minutes to diffuse that underwater bomb and i'm like and then he's like he's not done
3393280	3396240	saying like wish me luck and i'm like
3396960	3401600	he goes into the water and i'm like i've never i've never done that i've never tried i always
3401600	3406080	do that really if you show me a movie where a guy has to hold his breath applause people do that
3406960	3413040	wow because i always want to just measure like when i'd be dead if in a movie someone said okay
3413040	3417120	you have to hold your breath for three minutes i would just go oh i know i can't do that like
3417120	3421040	i could maybe do a minute and i'd be bummed out and that's why i would just not they don't always
3421040	3424480	say it they don't always call it out but you can see that they're going to go into water they're
3424480	3428080	like oh that's all underwater you know there's going to be underwater scenes so i'm like okay i
3428080	3432480	want to see if i could and i'm just sitting at a couch and the guy's going like that i can't even
3432480	3441200	go like this without running out of breath okay it's not a joke um so it's all right cry cry
3441200	3448960	exercise all right thanksgiving uh exercise okay for all of you like fractured people close your
3448960	3459360	eyes okay you are you you're the adult you you are in the home that you were in when you were
3459360	3465840	a child but you're adult you the home that your bedroom was in when you were let's say
3466720	3478240	10 years old so picture that home you're in it somewhere living room kitchen those are the two
3478240	3486800	possibilities so somewhere in this home is the bedroom that you slept in when you were 10
3488400	3495680	so now you're going to walk slowly to that door of that bedroom
3497280	3501920	i say slowly so that you can really picture it like because you remember what the carpet looked
3501920	3508640	like you remember the walls and the little chotchkes whatever now you get to the door
3510080	3519360	and you're going to open it and your 10 year old self is sitting in their bedroom on the bed
3520960	3525520	so picture who you were when you were 10 you are who you are now
3525840	3526340	now
3527840	3528340	now
3529920	3536640	you at home do this in your own head but heather will you describe that child physically
3540080	3548720	in a lot of ways i guess it's what i'm trying to emulate now um small always been small for my age
3549040	3555760	uh long brown hair bangs um no glasses yet uh not because i didn't need them just because
3555760	3564000	i didn't have any health insurance and we didn't realize it um shared the room with my sister
3566480	3575040	in a in a queen bed so 10 year old heather's sitting there what might she typically be doing
3575040	3584240	uh drawing so she's drawing now you're gonna sit down on the bed a comfortable distance from her
3585280	3592880	your adult self look at your 10 year old self uh what what do you think of her
3595040	3604080	like don't say what you think you're supposed to say like judge her or or praise her
3604720	3607120	what do you really think of her
3622800	3627360	oh man i wish i could tell her that it doesn't you don't have to be so afraid
3627360	3637360	that you're gonna spend the next 25 years being afraid and you don't have to but uh is she afraid
3637360	3648000	now at 10 at 10 yes yes absolutely scared shitless so she's a fearful person uh-huh
3648960	3657840	maybe for good reasons so all right so now speak to her now now say like you judge your appraiser
3657840	3661920	or whatever you thought those things but now tell her what you think an adult should tell her
3663840	3669760	oh be so confident believe yourself this sounds like so much bullshit like what so many people
3669840	3678560	say to like say to yourself but absolutely the truth like trust your gut stop stop thinking that
3681840	3683920	that somebody else's approval matters
3686800	3690160	yeah great perfect thanksgiving
3695600	3697200	all right now my second idea
3699760	3707440	now i'm gonna do i'm gonna do a thanksgiving rap and uh and heather you seem like a you seem
3707440	3712720	like a smart person like what i'd like you to do is try to like uh like you know how vincent price
3712720	3720480	like in thriller like he comes in and goes scary spiders and goblins like it's a thanksgiving rap
3720480	3726160	so like i want you to just come in you don't have to rhyme prefer if you didn't and just kind of like
3726960	3732640	just uncork and just kind of like just just talk the way you do and your cadence just kind of like
3732640	3736640	do i have to say it like vincent price no no no no no no i'd rather you just be yourself and just
3736640	3739920	kind of but just kind of like an amp maybe an amped up version of yourself for that looks like
3739920	3744000	it just kind of like babble for a little bit like it's like i'm pushing a heather button and you're
3744000	3748640	just kind of like talking about at the beginning or just talk about it no yeah whenever i i'll like
3748640	3754160	i'll cue you okay like i'll rap for a little bit um uh things to look for as i'm probably going
3754160	3758800	to talk about fucking people's mamas and uh there's a good chance i'm going to rhyme the words
3758800	3766160	south and mouth um all right i'm going to try not to because i like to try always trying to
3766160	3772720	stretch myself but uh but but but but then after a couple verses i'll like kind of then if i if i'm
3772720	3776560	faltering like if i stop or point at you or whatever and then just like just just like do
3776560	3782720	like a little just a little rambly monologue it could be free association or just like anything
3782960	3790160	story or just random words or doesn't absolutely doesn't matter just free flow thanksgiving anxiety
3790160	3794080	well not even thanksgiving like like does it i mean like family anxiety

4049120	4054880	my turkey bitches got a east coast because the coast is the most especially when there's no other
4054880	4066000	coast yet so thanksgiving is great and thanksgiving is fine and sometimes you think i just
4066000	4071840	want someone to like me a little and maybe i would like it if i heard my mom say hey i'm proud
4071840	4076400	but then i think well at least i didn't go to some thanksgiving where my mom is trying to fuck
4076400	4080800	some stranger because that would make me feel kind of awkward and maybe like i wouldn't want to go
4080800	4086960	home as much either so i guess it's good that we can just say hey and call each other once in a while
4086960	4091840	and you know i'll let it call again on christmas okay now you
4092080	4093680	yeah hike me

4220160	4225680	say joe chuck tell people things because they haven't heard it yet and then chuck could be like
4225680	4230080	sometimes he'd be like i don't know if i can and he would say i don't think i don't think you have
4230080	4234400	to i don't think they're ready for you chuck yeah are they ready are you ready like he would like
4234400	4240160	get the crowd ready for the science that may or may not be dropped and you know why that's
4240160	4244480	important for uh uh black men in the 90s tell me
4250880	4256000	den's still mad about you hyping heather well that's weird to hype that's like hyping vincent
4256000	4263360	price that's weird he doesn't have a hype valve she was the she was the rihanna like you don't
4263360	4271360	hype rihanna rihanna's fine hype hype mmm she was a guest i thought you know she did fine she
4271360	4275600	doesn't need hyping don't give don't give hype notes he was hyping people i gotta give him hype
4275600	4279680	notes you were just you just started the hype note session i was just asking what you know he's you

4349520	4355280	sorry i always felt like you're like a monster i know there's a there's a deficit in my am i i
4355280	4360480	have no ambition and i don't think i'm as creative as my as my friends uh who didn't like their
4360480	4366480	parents i like my family like i think that that's uh that's a real uh way to have a terrible career
4366480	4375440	in entertainment yeah i i love my family i do and uh i i don't know i texted with them i called
4375440	4381200	them i heard i heard from him wish them happiness that's why he's it's why you're not a born hype
4381200	4385840	man because that's arbitrary you're like you were born with hype built into your right you
4385840	4393360	are you you you came pre-hyped came out of the womb with hype in you and your mom hyped you and
4393360	4400400	you're like you're everyone's hyped around you people are generally hyped by you without you
4400400	4406160	having to hype them yeah like i get hyped just just to see your smile every morning that's what

4446720	4452240	day he's hyping all day flavor flavor is probably a piece of shit most of the day and then he's like
4452240	4456320	compensating when he gets out on stage with chuck he probably probably right before public enemy
4456320	4462560	went on i'm sure i'm sure flavor flavor is probably like yo chuck use a coaster man right

5469440	5478080	from starburns very not funny um a kid fell in a cactus that's kind of funny i guess yeah that was
5478080	5485200	sad uh well i thought that was funny so which which kid was it uh i was kids was it uh no it
5485200	5491600	was ios tenance three-year-old daughter that sounds that's not funny if it was ios kid that's
5491600	5498160	kind of funny because that kid's kind of a terror you know that's what dino was saying he was being

5504720	5507920	believe me nothing's gonna stop him from serial killing so it doesn't uh
5509040	5514640	and the kid's like just absolutely destined to be a serial killer especially did you uh communicate

5540480	5547120	at all my parents house is no longer like they sold it off they did then my dad moved to columbia
5547120	5555360	and my mom's couch surfing across america or something yeah catch up man yeah no it's it's
5555360	5561280	fine i i i did not know that your dad fucked off to uh yeah he fucked off there he's teaching uh
5561360	5570560	animation um he's not an animator so he's he's not really a teacher i think he now speaks Spanish
5570560	5578320	which i hope they speak over there um i believe they do okay good base is covered but yeah no i
5578320	5584480	it's just really weird it's it's weird it's weird that he now teaches animation in uh in columbia
5584480	5587760	so he's like like first day of class he's like everybody draw a picture
5588720	5593280	all right go home and then and then they come back and he's like okay now draw the same picture
5593280	5599360	but like a little different and then he's like why is it this different you get enough
5600720	5606880	why is this too different and then they slowly learn how to like animate it's probably that
5606880	5613040	hard to teach really yeah i mean it's probably not hard to teach a lot of disciplines yeah like name

5620720	5622960	more karate until it stops beating yeah
5628000	5632560	yeah you can teach karate and cpr and cpr is the opposite of karate yeah

5639520	5645120	special school spencer school of cpr and karate and your degree is like a playing card like where

5743680	5748560	to look back and find the origin and it was it was too much work so i what the hell's going on
5748560	5754560	you know that gram linnehan he's a great man great man that gram linnehan yeah he uh he posted he
5754560	5759200	posted something and talked about it was like a news article and talked about how he says that a
5759200	5764480	remote radicalization is a serious thing and it could happen in gamergate and i was like gamergate
5764480	5771520	those idiots and you know the floodgates opened oh man so just uh just the past 48 hours have
5771520	5778960	just been telling people to kill themselves and then blocking those people i saw some guys like
5778960	5782400	i don't know if you guys like harman jam but spencer quittenden wants everyone i know to dan
5782400	5788480	harman they tweeted that it's like were you here two weeks ago what do you think is gonna happen
5789920	5796400	wait people were telling telling on you to me yeah the reason i know about my name was
5796400	5801120	it was added onto that thing it's like hey jeff davis uh erin magatha dan harman yeah erin
5801120	5805680	magatha yes spencer quittenden really wants everyone to kill themselves uh click here if
5805680	5811920	you want to see all the uh the rich tapestry of all the times uh spencers they added in a mosaic
5811920	5824080	that formed my face when you zoomed out it's like mad magazine's 50th anniversary cover
5824720	5834000	um the yeah well yeah okay so yeah don't uh yeah if you're uh if you're 16 uh talk to somebody
5834000	5838240	unless you're in gamergate unless you're in gamer unless you're a gamergator then yeah kill yourself
5838240	5842160	your life anyway yeah i mean i would say yeah please and i know that i'm the only person in
5842160	5845680	the room that has no idea what that is gamergate means that there was a time when a woman said
5845680	5850000	something and all the gamer yeah i mean it would take us five minutes of going through it and even
5850080	5853840	just go it's one of those issues really well i think i can build off his thing in 30 seconds
5853840	5860080	what you just said happened and then from then on everyone's like no it didn't and then you know
5860080	5864480	some people are like well yeah that's that's history and then they are like no you're wrong
5864480	5868560	and now i'm going to bother you for two days straight because we don't believe in recording
5868560	5873280	that thing like the thing about is like we when we when we retell history we talk about stories
5873280	5877440	and we talk about people as if there's like these events that happen like oh archbishop
5877520	5881840	Ferdinand got assassinated in that but it's like no archduke whatever
5884320	5887600	don't don't rewrite he was he was he was effectively defrocked that day
5888160	5893520	um the the but it's like we we only do that because we have to have something to talk about
5893520	5898160	but the the scary thing is that's the scary thing about the trump thing because it was like honestly
5898160	5903840	like it's not a joke anymore to say like he's hitler like like and that he's exactly like
5903840	5908080	hitler and that he's hitler it's not a joke because like hitler had a funny haircut and
5908080	5913120	everyone was kept and he was a reality television star basically because he wrote mine conf and was
5913120	5917520	like oh look at me everybody look at me and he wasn't a genius and he wasn't like an idealist
5917520	5921840	at all he wasn't like a person that was like i think we should all do this or he was just a
5921840	5927440	guy that was like mad and dumb and was in the like like like like he served a purpose and like this
5927440	5931680	these like the weird thing about that gamergate thing is it's like what you because you keep
5931680	5936320	asking yourself like well why would you if you ever were getting involved in this why would you
5936320	5942640	even still be arguing about all this stuff and the answer is because it's never about like these
5942640	5947680	events or these people it's always about like these weird like shifts like these bio masses
5947680	5952960	they just build up frustration and shame and rage and then they flow this way or that way
5952960	5959120	there's like these magmatic like like eruptions and everybody that's that that is like beating
5959120	5964720	people at donald trump rallies and being into it they take they know like they're not they know
5964720	5969920	he's an idiot like and they're into it like they're like oh good he's gonna say it so like i can now
5969920	5975360	i can hit this guy with a pole and then donald trump's like like that guy hit a guy with a pole
5975360	5980240	because i'm very popular and he's like an idiot like he doesn't he doesn't know what he's doing
5980240	5985360	like like that's the scary thing is like he the humanities like evil like it gathers in these
5985360	5990800	clouds and it's just like and it's because of hero worship it's because we think that individuals
5990800	5996080	are like important and that oh you said that you should be the way we're gonna cut this guy's head
5996080	6000560	off and if we cut that guy's head off then nothing bad will happen anymore and thinking that is what
6000560	6005440	allows for like these clouds of evil to spread and like like like like that's what's happening
6005440	6009280	right now we're like living in history like there's a fucking fascist running for president
6009280	6013200	and he's it doesn't make him cool at all it doesn't even make him cool in like a fucking
6013200	6018400	bad guy way he's just a fucking clown but he's like there's so many angry fucking people that
6018400	6022640	are like they're just like and they're not even like can you imagine like after world war one how
6022640	6027200	they were using like wads of money for door stops and toilet paper like that's how fucking scared
6027200	6033120	they were the the we're just like oh i have to golf nine holes instead of 18 like like and there's
6033120	6038160	fucking hitting hispanic people at rallies and then they're saying to him like hey what about
6038160	6044560	that guy that got beaten at your rally and he's like well my fans are passionate like like it's
6044560	6049760	fucking and his hair's everywhere and everyone's like hearty har har like fucking like he's Hitler
6049760	6054000	he's Hitler which is not it doesn't make him important doesn't make him strong it doesn't
6054000	6060720	make him scary even it makes the fucking situation scary he's Hitler we're scary like we're doing
6060720	6065760	fucked up scary shit gamergate is fucking another one of those things because those guys those
6066000	6072480	guys got in a van and like went and shot up that like those are like those were like 4chan
6072480	6076640	dude there was like a guy from 4chan that 4chan doesn't even like that was like went and shot the
6077600	6082240	the the black lives matter they were like oh i don't know if they were related to the the
6082240	6086720	agitators at those uh the minnesota protests there was like video i don't know it's it's
6086720	6091120	somehow related in there i'm not i'm not the last thing i'm gonna do is go like yeah 4chan
6091120	6100000	anything because my fucking credit card shut off tomorrow but uh the uh the the the but because
6100000	6104320	that guy was like some knob who was like there was like a guy in the video who was like oh i'm
6104320	6110400	gonna go do this like that i'm gonna go troll the like black lives matter protest i don't know but
6110400	6117040	and then guns that end up getting fired and yeah five people got shot anyways uh but it but my
6117040	6123840	point being fringe fringe groups radical groups dumb dumb ass fascist like politicians like
6123840	6129600	what's happening right now is just as as gradual and dangerous as the weather or as like a super
6129600	6134960	volcano under yellowstone it's not it has nothing to do with like oh no however this election goes
6134960	6139360	wrong it's like fucking people are getting dumber and dumber and dumber and more and more dangerous
6139360	6148320	what are we gonna do about it millennials keep hashtagging just make sure hashtag keep hashtagging
6151520	6156320	make sure everybody uh is real polite to each other um there's a fucking fascist running for
6156320	6162800	president and you can't do anything about it like there's nothing grab a brick tell him i sent you
6162800	6166800	grab a fucking brick and throw it through something i i don't think i don't think uh
6166800	6172080	donald trump is a fascist i think that he no he's a fucking fascist i think this is not an
6172080	6177520	argument i i think he's a windsock he goes where that's what a fascist is it's an opportunistic
6177520	6183520	infection in a time of economic he he caters to people that like if he if he finds out that
6183520	6188160	fascists will vote for him he will do exactly their bidding that's what i said brother dog
6188160	6192880	don't don't irritate me that's what i said but like but like adolf hitler sat in his cell and
6192960	6198160	wrote down some like some terrible fucking horrible shit like i don't i don't know if he was all that
6198160	6202320	intelligent he just wrote it's just time moves slower back then that's all he's he's sat in a
6202320	6205760	cell for four years and wrote a dumb ass book like donald trump was on a fucking reality show
6205760	6210000	you're fired you're fired like like it's just he's he's and he put on a baseball cap it's like i'll
6210000	6216000	be president like it's like everyone's like yeah i'm like i'm gonna associate that with the things
6216000	6220320	that make me angry and he's like okay i heard that like that's the scary things i think there
6220720	6225440	are dangerous people in the republican party like they actually have more like for me like a little
6225440	6230400	bit more like violent fascistic views they actually really do believe it i don't i don't know that
6230400	6234960	donald trump particularly believes in anything at all i think he's why are we talking to a brick
6234960	6239280	wall that's what i'm saying that's what makes him dangerous he's a fucking idiot he doesn't believe
6239280	6245440	in anything that means that people who are they're clockwork orging people they're fucking beating
6245440	6249920	people with sticks and he's saying and then they're asking him about it on morning shows and he's
6249920	6256800	going like well my fans are number one like like he's that's what's dangerous not a fucking guy
6256800	6261120	who's like i'm gonna take over the world like like that guy's fine we've been living with that for 60
6261120	6266640	years well like like like i'm saying this guy's a fucking a-class number one dip shit
6267280	6271840	like he called mexicans rapists and he's still running he's still getting out of bed every
6271840	6278000	morning he's just the right kind of dumb to to to fucking like make some horrible people able to do
6278000	6283520	shit like like like we're one step from like history here yeah the whole thing now the whole
6283520	6288320	like and i was wrong by the way that's i forgot to mention that i fucking full retraction remember
6288320	6292240	when erin went to ireland and she's like everyone here is worried that trump's going to be president
6292240	6297680	and i was like come on give it as a fucking joke i i've never been wronger in my life i'm so wrong
6297680	6303520	i'm so terrified right now he slipped 10 points in very recent history which is a pretty big drop
6304480	6308880	percentage points those what do you think he finally did wrong did he like eat a baby i think
6308880	6314720	people just saw how good he was doing and be like we can't just stand by we gotta vote in these polls
6318160	6326240	polls the polls anybody here a trump supporter and don't clap ironically anybody no i would love
6326240	6330720	to meet somebody and not like not ironically no i heard well i heard a guy and i was like like
6330720	6334400	this is how they sound there was a guy because they were talking about that whole thing of how
6334400	6339120	like well this is a fucking historical game changer where people are physically beaten at your
6339120	6346080	speeches and you don't condemn it like the the the and so they're asking this guy about it and he
6346080	6352080	said his his his response he was like a spokesman or something it was like a and and he said come
6352080	6357920	on this is just ridiculous like if uh like what is every time a black man commits a crime is it
6357920	6363520	obama's fault that's what the guy said was like what the fucking deep dark glance into like the
6363520	6371200	weird weirdest fucking what the fuck like like that's what they sound like that's skinhead talk

7580000	7584480	was really no good reason for us to come here like uh this is something that we can't we think
7584480	7588080	that the mob would know something about the disappearance we did think that but like it
7588080	7595600	wasn't again we're just bad shadow runners uh so i i kind of like i square off with the
7595600	7600880	security guys and i and i just kind of i give them a professional nod like you know
7602640	7607760	it's obvious from my face and like look we're both paid to make sure that everybody doesn't die
7608480	7613120	you know like let's let's let's let's let's let's keep keep it that way
7616000	7617280	you do that kind of nod
7617280	7628960	well i say and i say i say i say i don't speak uh uh chinese do i no i don't i try
7630960	7636240	what could go wrong no no no no i say i say i say i say i say we'll be out of here in in
7636240	7643920	just a second guys okay uh um i look around to see if there's anything we can get from this

7649440	7654560	doctor can i can i just nab some we paid a lot to get in here i'm just saying it should be worth
7654560	7660240	our while a little bit probably paid more than we're gonna make on the mission well that's not
7660240	7667280	true wait we're doing this for money it was oh yeah or guns yeah both yeah we really fucked up
7667280	7673280	again so we we just came to a chinese opium den for no reason we're pretty much you came there
7673280	7679120	because these these market these these flesh to freshers they seem to have ties with meat markets
7679120	7683200	and meat markets might have ties to them up that's why i believe you guys went over here
7683200	7686480	oh let's ask about the meat market all right mitch china man is there a meat market it's
7686480	7691200	a fact that i can't i'm not good at this wait flesh to fresh isn't a meat market no they're
