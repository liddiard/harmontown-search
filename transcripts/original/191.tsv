0	10240	Oh yeah, this musical theme is created by Jordy White from Marilyn Manson fame, who
10240	16120	is joining us next week with Fred Sublon because of a new show on Feraladio, Hour of Goon is
16120	17120	also airing.
17120	23000	So Jordy's made us a lot of music, so get ready for a lot of groovy spooky rock from
23000	24000	Jordy White.
24000	28000	I think there's lyrics at some point too.
30000	32000	Let's bring a special critic in everybody.
44000	47000	The mayor of Harbin Town, Mr. Dan Harbin.
53000	54000	Thank you very much.
60000	62000	Yeah, did you explain that?
62000	63000	I did.
63000	64000	I shouted it out.
64000	65000	Alright.
65000	68000	I was getting all ready to explain the Marilyn Manson guy.
68000	71000	Now how am I going to start the show?
71000	73000	Take a swing at it.
73000	76000	This guy from Marilyn Manson made music.
79000	82000	He's going to be on the show in a couple weeks.
82000	86000	That guy likes Star Wars and comic books more than anybody in this room.
86000	89000	He is the biggest sci-fi geek in the universe.
89000	90000	It's great.
90000	95000	I got Star Wars on my Apple TV.
95000	97000	I watched Hateful Eight instead.
97000	101000	I can't believe.
101000	104000	I'm kind of proud and ashamed of it at the same time.
104000	107000	Every time I open up the thing, I'm like, I'm going to watch a movie and then I see
107000	108000	the other new Star Wars.
108000	111000	I'm like, I'll just watch it some other time.
111000	118000	I saw the clip of Han Solo wanting to use the crossbow and then he's like,
118000	121000	I like it.
121000	124000	I can extrapolate what that movie is going to be.
124000	126000	It's not for me, right?
126000	128000	It's not for me.
128000	129000	Yeah.
129000	132000	I think I mentioned that I fell asleep in the theater and then fell asleep in my dreamer.
132000	134000	We're old, you know?
134000	136000	We're old.
136000	137000	Is it for young people?
137000	138000	Spencer, did you watch it?
138000	139000	Did you dig the new one?
139000	141000	I never got into Star Wars, man.
141000	146000	I saw it like a couple times as a kid, but then anytime I'd seen any part of it since
146000	148000	then, I was like, what the fuck?
148000	150000	Is this Darth Vader?
150000	152000	He's in this one too?
152000	154000	It's just really crazy to me.
154000	156000	So it's just the same thing.
156000	160000	I'm excited about the fact that they're what they're doing industrially speaking.
160000	164000	I think they might as well break that thing open and do what they're doing in a
164000	165000	post Marvel world.
165000	167000	That's what let's watch a million Star Wars movies.
167000	172000	I don't mind that because they're taking the, you know, they're just throwing
172000	173000	everything at the wall.
173000	176000	And so some of that shit's going to be good.
176000	178000	All different writers and directors and stuff.
178000	179000	It's going to be fun.
179000	181000	It's not a secret, right?
181000	183000	The Legos guys are doing the Han Solo thing.
183000	184000	That's all announced and stuff.
184000	187000	And Adam Driver is playing Han Solo.
187000	190000	Am I getting any of this right or am I just old?
190000	192000	I could have just all wrong.
192000	195000	No, Adam Driver is playing.
195000	197000	Never mind.
197000	202000	Adam Arkin is driving them to the lot.
203000	208000	Yeah, I'm getting ready to, you know, I'm just banking stuff for, you know,
208000	212000	I'm just trying to put together a nest egg for my retirement now.
212000	214000	And I don't need to take in any more pop culture.
214000	216000	I'm not going to be relevant.
216000	220000	Ten years from now when this stuff's going to be funny to reference, you know,
220000	225000	like when I was 35, you bust out a Goonies joke and people will be like,
225000	227000	ugh.
227000	231000	So the equivalent of that, right, right now for this stuff, I'd be like 70 going
231000	238000	like, remember the remake of the remake of the remake of the Goonies?
238000	241000	And people would be like, go to bed, old man.
241000	244000	Do you have an idea of retirement age?
244000	246000	Do you think you want to retire at some point?
246000	248000	42.
248000	251000	I am currently a year behind schedule.
251000	254000	I spent the day retired.
254000	258000	I didn't have to shoot, I was supposed to be writing my book for a double day,
258000	265000	but instead, I really was a bad boy today.
265000	268000	Like, a girlfriend's out of town.
268000	271000	So it was literally like, you heard my voice last week.
271000	276000	Like, I've not been outside of anyone's company for like months.
276000	279000	And like, I just sort of, I just veged out today.
279000	285000	And I kept opening up my computer and going, okay, I'm going to start writing.
285000	296000	But like, I took like bullshit time-wasting video gaming to a new level today.
296000	299000	And just actually made some interesting discoveries.
299000	305000	I've been playing this game called Avengers Academy on the iPad.
305000	313000	It's like a game for and by 13-year-old girls set in the Marvel universe in which all the Marvel characters
313000	316000	are going to prep school.
316000	321000	And you press on Wasp and she says, like, want to take a selfie?
321000	324000	And then she takes a selfie for a while.
324000	329000	And you can make her take selfies faster if you buy enough crystals.
329000	332000	But like, you know, you're not going to pay any money, right?
332000	334000	You're going to beat the game.
334000	336000	And so I've been on this thing for a while.
336000	340000	And now they've got the Guardians of the Galaxy event happening this weekend,
340000	341000	or all through April.
341000	344000	So there's like, you can unlock Guardians of the Galaxy.
344000	346000	They crashed outside the campus.
346000	349000	And it's just a farming game.
349000	353000	It's getting really scary how much of a science they've gotten,
353000	357000	like, are just dopamine spiking to a thing.
357000	363000	So you can see the effect it has had on me.
363000	366000	I'm not as put together as I usually am.
366000	369000	But there was a game I found.
369000	372000	It's called Adventure Capitalist.
372000	377000	It's by this, the company's called Congregate with a K.
377000	379000	I'm actually recommending it.
379000	380000	You should check it out.
380000	382000	I'm not going to say everybody in the world's going to like it,
382000	387000	but it's insanely minimalist.
387000	393000	It literally is like you press a button to make your lemonade stand
393000	395000	generate money.
395000	398000	So it's a progress indicator that goes, whoop.
398000	400000	Your lemonade stand has made money.
400000	403000	So then you press it again and it, whoop, did it again.
403000	404000	Whoop.
404000	405000	And you keep doing it.
405000	406000	And after a while, if you keep doing it,
406000	408000	a button appears below it that says,
408000	412000	well, now you can buy a donut shop.
412000	413000	More money.
413000	416000	Progress indicator goes a little slower.
416000	418000	After a while, you get some more money.
418000	421000	And then it goes, hey, you tired of pressing those buttons?
421000	422000	Why don't you hire a manager?
422000	424000	And then you go to the thing.
424000	426000	And you hire these managers.
426000	428000	A lemonade manager, $1,000.
428000	429000	Whoop.
429000	430000	And he's like, whoop, whoop, whoop.
430000	431000	Your lemonade's getting made.
431000	433000	And you orgasm when that happens.
433000	434000	They trick you.
434000	435000	You're going to be like, oh, my god.
435000	439000	It's making lemonade of whether I touch it or not.
439000	441000	And then you do the same with the donuts.
441000	442000	And it goes all the way.
442000	444000	There's two rows on the iPad.
444000	446000	If it's portrait style, it's two rows.
446000	449000	The bottom row is just oil rigs and everything.
449000	453000	And I've been playing it for two days straight
453000	456000	because part of the game is once you get into quadrillions
456000	462000	of dollars, you can restart.
462000	468000	You accrue these angel investors, which means basically
468000	470000	all it means is that you can start the game over.
470000	475000	And it's like everything costs different.
475000	476000	But it's insane.
476000	477000	I'm so fucking addicted to it.
477000	478000	They've figured it out.
478000	482000	You don't need a Pac-Man eating dots even.
482000	483000	We're monkeys.
483000	485000	We'll just sit there and fucking...
485000	488000	I've got the thing running right now.
488000	491000	I can't wait to get home.
491000	493000	Can we fire it up and see where you're at right now?
493000	494000	No, no, no.
494000	500000	What I want to do with my phone is I brought Avengers Academy
500000	502000	back to that.
502000	504000	So I'm playing Avengers Academy.
504000	506000	And it's these kids that are young adults,
506000	510000	and they've got will-they-won't-they stories going on.
510000	513000	And it's all family-oriented.
513000	516000	The Tony Stark character, of course, is supposed to be...
516000	517000	He's supposed to be like the...
517000	518000	You know, he's like the...
518000	522000	For those of you who are my age, three of you,
522000	526000	he's the Mahoney of this academy?
526000	527000	Nope.
527000	528000	Nobody's...
528000	532000	That was for me and you.
532000	536000	And Spencer's dad listening somewhere at home.
536000	544000	Okay, so every time you touch these kids...
544000	545000	All right.
545000	549000	If that was for me, you and a couple people.
549000	554000	Now I'm listening.
554000	555000	Go on.
555000	559000	Every time we touch these kids, you get a dollar.
559000	562000	And they get a piece of candy.
562000	566000	You touch enough kids, you get a van.
566000	568000	But it has windows in it, and you have to...
568000	576000	But you can remove them as you upgrade.
576000	581000	Your crawl space needs more space.
581000	582000	Yes.
582000	588000	You need a shovel sharpener.
588000	592000	It's to bury the kids you killed.
592000	596000	You sickos.
596000	599000	Okay, but every time you touch one of these young folks,
599000	601000	that made it better.
601000	602000	Made it worse.
602000	606000	Every time you tap on one of them, you know, they just...
606000	608000	Every time you tap that?
608000	610000	They have a sound bite.
610000	613000	So like I said, if you tap Wasp, she goes like,
613000	616000	so fierce.
616000	618000	They have like 20 random things.
618000	622000	So sometimes she'll go like, whatever happened to romance?
622000	623000	Let's see.
623000	624000	I think I have...
624000	626000	I want to just set the tone for you.
626000	627000	So let's see.
627000	630000	Here's a Wasp one.
630000	631000	Wait.
631000	632000	Oh, shit.
632000	633000	I got to put it.
633000	634000	Okay.
634000	636000	This party started.
636000	639000	Let's get this party started, Wasp says.
640000	642000	So, you know, it's just...
642000	645000	In case you didn't know what a sound bite was.
645000	647000	Can I hear a couple more?
647000	649000	Loki is going to the Academy too.
649000	651000	He's kind of like, I know what you're saying.
651000	652000	Isn't he a bad guy?
652000	654000	Well, that's the thing about when you're in school,
654000	657000	it's like frenemies, you know?
657000	660000	So like Red Skull will come in a leather jacket
660000	662000	and he'll be like, what's up?
662000	664000	He'll be like, get out of here.
664000	667000	And I'll be like, okay, so...
667000	670000	So here's some Loki sound bites, or one Loki sound bite.
670000	673000	I didn't take orders from you.
673000	675000	So that's just like...
675000	677000	Imagine that these are just little bites.
677000	679000	He's the Geico Gecko?
679000	683000	So over time you're going to hear these things 5,000 times
683000	685000	if you're really addicted to this game.
685000	689000	So the thing is about the Tony Stark character.
689000	693000	If the kid playing Tony Stark is a fan of the podcast,
693000	699000	I hope he doesn't do anything untoward to himself.
699000	700000	You sound fine.
700000	703000	You should be working in voiceover work.
703000	708000	Your clips were poorly directed and poorly chosen for the game
708000	711000	because they're very, very long for considering
711000	713000	that every time I tap on Tony Stark,
713000	717000	which is going to be a lot because he's the best,
717000	720000	and he makes everything.
720000	725000	So you have to hear these very long sound clips.
725000	730000	So I recorded a handful of Tony Stark's sound bites
730000	734000	until I got to the one that really, really bothers me.
734000	736000	And I think it's the last one.
736000	738000	So first we'll just listen to a couple.
738000	740000	I didn't take orders.
740000	742000	Oops, that's not...
742000	746000	Could you imagine if that was Tony Stark?
746000	749000	Why did you bring me to this podcast?
750000	752000	No, I swear.
752000	755000	Rob Cordray was here last week.
755000	758000	He's my favorite writer.
758000	762000	Someone's on a first date tonight.
762000	765000	And I blew it for them.
765000	766000	Blew it.
766000	768000	But there's one other person who's on a first date,
768000	770000	and we're nailing it somehow.
770000	772000	I don't know how. I don't know.
772000	775000	Maybe the girl that brought the guy,
775000	779000	maybe he's a big Avengers fan.
779000	782000	And he's like, I didn't know you'd take me to see a fat guy
782000	785000	play clips from the thing.
785000	787000	And she's like, yeah, well, I know what I'm doing.
787000	790000	And he's like, I'm going to make love to you tonight.
790000	792000	And she's like...
792000	795000	See how you reverse those roles to give the women agency?
795000	799000	I was going to go see David Gilmour from Pink Floyd,
799000	802000	but I'm so much happier that we came to see this.
802000	807000	Oh, the fat guy. Yes, okay.
807000	809000	The fat guy playing clips.
809000	811000	That's David Gilmour from Pink Floyd.
811000	814000	No, he's a very sexy guy from Pink Floyd, isn't he?
814000	816000	God, is he here?
816000	818000	I think he's playing tonight at the Forum or something.
818000	821000	Oh, okay. I was trying to figure out what dot you were connecting.
821000	823000	Tonight's the dot.
823000	826000	We live in the entertainment capital of the world.
826000	829000	There's a lot of choices for your entertainment dollar.
829000	831000	David Gilmour from Pink Floyd is fighting.
831000	836000	I mean, even I would say better to come here.
836000	838000	Even you? Yeah.
838000	844000	If Roger Waters isn't there, come here.
844000	848000	Wow. Shots fired.
848000	852000	All right. So here's some Tony Stark.
852000	856000	Let's get serious. Or not.
856000	858000	Okay. He's funny. He's the funny one.
858000	860000	So remember that one, okay?
860000	862000	He's the funny one. Remember that one.
862000	865000	Let's get serious. Or not.
865000	869000	Okay. So that one's going to come back to haunt you in a second.
869000	871000	Here's some more.
871000	873000	We make a great team.
873000	876000	I mean, I'm the boss, but still.
876000	877000	Okay. Okay.
877000	878000	All right.
878000	880000	Tony, let's do a couple more.
880000	882000	Longer. Longer. Longer.
882000	885000	Remember, kids are going to have to listen to this 500 times today.
885000	887000	Can I give you one more note? We do it again.
887000	889000	Can you trail off towards the end?
889000	892000	Can that lose energy, kind of?
892000	894000	Yeah. There's one that's not on here where he goes,
894000	897000	you can tell that the kid that's doing the voice,
897000	899000	you can tell that the director was like,
899000	901000	I think we're missing the...
901000	902000	Can you do it one more time?
902000	903000	I don't think we're getting the word assistant,
903000	905000	because the catchphrase is,
905000	910000	maybe you could be my new assistant.
910000	913000	And it's really weird.
913000	914000	All right.
914000	915000	There's some more.
915000	917000	This has a payoff, kind of.
917000	918000	I'm a genius.
918000	920000	Yeah. He just said he's...
920000	925000	How does everyone feel about me making an army of robots?
925000	926000	Whatever.
926000	929000	I mean, we feel great. Like, do it.
929000	932000	It's not a catchphrase.
932000	935000	Do you think villains know that they don't have a chance,
935000	938000	or do they just not get it?
938000	940000	This is like nails on a chalkboard.
940000	941000	I don't like...
941000	943000	Okay. I think this next one might be...
943000	944000	Let me... Oh, boy.
944000	946000	Let me... Okay.
947000	948000	I'm taking a half day.
948000	950000	No. That one's fine. That's short.
950000	952000	Let's get serious.
952000	955000	Okay. So here we go.
955000	957000	So two of them...
957000	959000	Two of them start with, let's get serious.
959000	962000	So you remember the first one starts with a middle...
962000	965000	Down the third baseline, let's get serious.
965000	968000	Or not. You know, it's fine.
968000	969000	But now he's... Is he growing up?
969000	970000	Is he growing through puberty?
970000	972000	No, no. This one sounds like he's just clipping the mic,
972000	974000	and he's just enraged at first.
974000	978000	But now, listen. Don't react like after, let's get serious.
978000	980000	Listen to the tag on this one.
980000	982000	So it's a different...
982000	986000	Why they would include two, let's get serious ones, I don't know.
986000	989000	But this one is the worst.
989000	990000	This is the worst...
990000	992000	It's not the worst Avenger Academy catchphrase.
992000	995000	It's not the worst thing...
995000	998000	This is the worst thing ever.
998000	1001000	There's like a one in 20 chance you hear this
1001000	1003000	every time you tap on Tony Stark.
1003000	1007000	Okay. So again, don't react after he says, let's get serious.
1007000	1011000	Wait for it. Wait for the amazing punchline.
1013000	1018000	Let's get serious, is what people tell me all the time.
1029000	1031000	Is that a line from the movie?
1031000	1036000	No! That's not a line from humanity.
1036000	1038000	I have not seen the Iron Man films.
1038000	1042000	Are people constantly saying you're too serious, or you should be more serious?
1042000	1048000	Everybody cool it! It's something people say to me.
1048000	1051000	No one ever talks like that. That's awful.
1051000	1055000	And it's really long, and it's terrible.
1055000	1057000	Maybe it lost something in the translation, but
1057000	1060000	it's all I could do to play this game for the last two weeks.
1060000	1062000	It's not enough to scare you off playing it.
1062000	1065000	No, I'm addicted. I love wasp selfies.
1065000	1069000	I'm leveling them up.
1069000	1074000	There's a little intrigue with Director Fury.
1074000	1076000	He's like...
1076000	1081000	Black Widow is mistrustful of the Avengers Academy.
1081000	1086000	There's little plots and things, but really it's just a farming game.
1087000	1091000	So that's what I did today instead of writing a book.
1091000	1093000	What's your book deal?
1093000	1096000	If you had a book deal, you'd play video games, right?
1096000	1100000	Because while you're playing video games, you're not sitting there going,
1100000	1103000	Fuck, I want to kill myself. I wish I had a book deal.
1103000	1107000	Trust me, apparently if you had a book deal, you'd play video games.
1107000	1109000	Do you have a deadline?
1109000	1112000	Yeah, I do.
1112000	1117000	Oh yeah, they're strict about that stuff in publishing, yes.
1117000	1120000	Hey, can you say how far off it is right now?
1120000	1123000	It's spring-ish.
1123000	1126000	Aren't we currently in spring right now?
1126000	1129000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1129000	1131000	Spring 2016?
1131000	1133000	Let's get down to work on this book.
1133000	1134000	Or not.
1134000	1138000	It's something my agent's been telling me.
1143000	1147000	Wait, so you got a month or two left?
1147000	1150000	Jeff, stop.
1150000	1153000	We're going to come up with a name for this.
1153000	1155000	The blood thirst that Jeff gets.
1155000	1158000	No, this is not me trying to do a pecking party.
1158000	1162000	I'm saying, this is honest curiosity.
1162000	1165000	It's due soon, dude.
1165000	1169000	Okay, are you clipping along?
1169000	1171000	No!
1171000	1175000	I wrote a really good introduction,
1175000	1178000	and I think I have a title.
1178000	1181000	Is it autobiographical? Is it fiction?
1181000	1183000	Is it a young adult detective series?
1183000	1185000	What do you got?
1185000	1188000	Please write a young adult detective series.
1188000	1191000	That'd be so fucking awesome.
1191000	1193000	Once this hits the New York Times bestseller list,
1193000	1195000	people will come back to me and go,
1195000	1196000	what book would you like to write next?
1196000	1200000	I'll go, maybe a re-envisioning of Encyclopedia Brown.
1201000	1203000	That would be heaven on earth.
1203000	1207000	Or maybe a young Tony Stark.
1207000	1209000	Solve this mystery!
1209000	1215000	It's something I should really be saying to myself right now.
1215000	1218000	It's just weird, right, Spencer?
1218000	1222000	It's almost too upsetting a joke to even try and ape
1222000	1224000	and make fun of, you know?
1224000	1226000	I'm kind of like not laughing at you or making fun of it.
1226000	1229000	That's how bad the original joke is.
1229000	1231000	It's upsetting.
1236000	1239000	Our next guest...
1244000	1247000	Sometimes sadness can be its own segue.
1250000	1254000	Our next guest has appeared at clubs and colleges all over the...
1254000	1259000	He's certainly a close cousin of the Harbin Town family,
1259000	1261000	but I don't know if he's ever been on Harbin Town or not.
1261000	1263000	I can't remember.
1263000	1265000	Well, let's ask him.
1265000	1268000	Certainly people that listen to this podcast believe that we don't remember that answer.
1268000	1270000	Probably know who he is.
1270000	1275000	I recently called him out on his middle initial
1275000	1277000	and demanded to see his birth certificate.
1277000	1280000	I don't know if he's brought it or not,
1280000	1283000	but let's get to know Paul F. Tompkins, everybody.
1300000	1302000	Hi.
1302000	1305000	Hi, everybody.
1305000	1307000	Hi, internet.
1310000	1316000	You received the one Dave Klein standing ovation.
1316000	1318000	That's right.
1318000	1320000	That's right.
1320000	1323000	So, all right, a couple of things to get out of the way.
1323000	1325000	Yeah, let's get right down to it, Dan.
1325000	1328000	Well, I read... I don't know why I did this.
1328000	1330000	I had no idea why I did this.
1330000	1333000	I read an AV club comment section.
1333000	1334000	Oh, no.
1334000	1336000	Underneath an episode of Great Minds,
1336000	1339000	this thing that you're going to do an episode of,
1339000	1341000	my thing on the History Channel,
1341000	1343000	which has now been rebranded History,
1343000	1346000	so that it's confusing,
1346000	1348000	because History is a thing.
1348000	1349000	It's the opposite of branding.
1349000	1350000	All right.
1350000	1354000	So, do you think people will look for the show just in history?
1354000	1356000	Yeah.
1356000	1359000	They're like, dig up old tests that they took
1359000	1361000	that their mom saved in a shoebox.
1361000	1364000	Was there anything about Dan Harmon's show in here?
1365000	1367000	I understand what they're doing because they're saying,
1367000	1368000	well, channel?
1368000	1371000	That's my grandpa's TV's name.
1371000	1373000	That's right.
1373000	1376000	Because what's a channel, grandpa?
1376000	1379000	But if you take the channel off of history,
1379000	1384000	you have just a word, a very, very, very vague word.
1384000	1388000	And also a huge word that they're just laying claim to.
1388000	1389000	Yeah.
1389000	1390000	That's pretty bold.
1390000	1393000	Yeah, it'll never trend.
1393000	1394000	It's as dumb as naming your...
1394000	1395000	It'll never trend.
1395000	1396000	Yeah.
1396000	1399000	It's as stupid as naming your TV show Community
1399000	1401000	or something like that.
1401000	1403000	They're like, hey, how come we're not trending?
1403000	1405000	Oh, but because you fucking,
1405000	1407000	they had to take that word along with Justin Bieber
1407000	1411000	and the out of the fucking trending algorithm.
1415000	1416000	It's true.
1416000	1418000	It's very true.
1418000	1422000	The History Channel is...
1422000	1423000	Hi, Paul.
1423000	1424000	I'm right behind you.
1424000	1425000	I'm sorry.
1425000	1426000	I should have told you, Paul.
1426000	1427000	Jeff's here.
1427000	1428000	The History Channel is pretty light on history now.
1428000	1432000	There's a lot of UFO things and lots of weird conspiracy shit.
1432000	1434000	But you're actually bringing it back.
1434000	1435000	Bringing it back to its roots.
1435000	1436000	With the comedy.
1436000	1437000	Yeah.
1437000	1441000	I applaud that movement because we all love work, right?
1441000	1443000	But speaking of which, so I saw,
1443000	1445000	I'm going to read no AV Club review,
1445000	1447000	let alone the comment section.
1447000	1448000	What was I thinking?
1448000	1449000	But then someone linked a thing.
1449000	1450000	I don't know what it is.
1450000	1452000	Someone tweets a link and says,
1452000	1453000	this show's great.
1453000	1455000	And then they tweet a link to the review.
1455000	1458000	I'll get tricked into thinking it's okay to read the review.
1458000	1459000	And then I'll scroll down.
1459000	1460000	I don't know.
1460000	1461000	Why am I scrolling down?
1461000	1463000	What bad thing are they going to say
1463000	1465000	about my stupid late night thing and the thing?
1465000	1469000	So a big thing was that I ripped off dead authors' podcasts.
1469000	1470000	Right.
1470000	1473000	So sorry about that.
1473000	1474000	No, no.
1474000	1477000	I mean, but because somebody had said a similar thing to me.
1477000	1479000	Like, hey, isn't this the same idea?
1479000	1481000	It's not really the same idea.
1481000	1483000	And also the idea for dead authors
1483000	1486000	came from a Steve Allen show called Meeting of the Minds.
1486000	1488000	Right, which is what this show came from as well
1488000	1491000	by Rich Korsin, the daily show guy who created the show
1491000	1494000	and hired me to host this pilot that didn't get picked up by IFC
1494000	1496000	and then just handed it over to the History Channel.
1496000	1499000	Essentially, people, anyone who was old enough to remember
1499000	1501000	Meeting of the Minds with Steve Allen
1501000	1502000	had in the back of their head,
1502000	1504000	I wish this show was entertaining.
1504000	1507000	Yeah.
1508000	1511000	So eventually you grow up and you take power into your own hands.
1511000	1514000	It's a podcast. It's audio only.
1514000	1518000	Have you committed it to the lookies?
1518000	1523000	I mean, we would do like the live shows we would do in costume.
1523000	1525000	Like we would do it, you know, in front of an audience,
1525000	1527000	in costume, in character.
1527000	1528000	So I ripped it off then.
1528000	1533000	No, but I didn't come up with the dead author's concept.
1533000	1536000	I just came up with the idea of doing it as a podcast.
1536000	1538000	I got invited to do the show.
1538000	1541000	It was invented by a guy named John Corn in San Francisco
1541000	1544000	who worked for 826 up there.
1544000	1548000	And the idea was they would get someone to pretend to be a dead author
1548000	1552000	in costume and they would like do a Q&A with people, with an audience.
1552000	1556000	And then I got asked to do it with Jen Kirkman and Eddie Pepitone
1556000	1559000	for a show. It was the first time I did it.
1559000	1563000	And I, for whatever reason, decided to be HG Wells.
1563000	1567000	And it was not decided beforehand how the show was going to go.
1567000	1570000	And so the idea was the three of us would just go out in front of this audience
1570000	1572000	of indifferent people.
1572000	1576000	And we would field questions from people who did not know what was going on
1576000	1578000	and did not care.
1578000	1582000	So I said, how about I moderate it in character?
1582000	1584000	And the whole conceit came up like right then.
1584000	1587000	It's like, let's say I transported you guys in my time machine,
1587000	1588000	which is real.
1588000	1590000	And so I'll ask questions to get it going.
1590000	1592000	And then hopefully the audience would join in.
1592000	1596000	Which they didn't, except for one very drunk person
1596000	1601000	at three in the afternoon at the West Hollywood Book Fair.
1601000	1602000	And that was it.
1602000	1603000	And then it was a lot of fun.
1603000	1606000	And I said, well, this could easily be a regular show.
1606000	1607000	And that was it.
1607000	1610000	Well, that sounds like it is derivative of it.
1610000	1614000	I mean, it sounds like it bumps enough that the people in the comment section
1614000	1616000	weren't huge dicks by pointing it out.
1616000	1618000	When there's a dot there, they'll connect it.
1618000	1620000	Then they talked about my weight.
1620000	1626000	Then it just didn't stop until it was rubble, just charred rubble.
1626000	1627000	And I don't know.
1627000	1628000	I don't understand.
1628000	1633000	When did I start trying to convince people I was thin?
1633000	1636000	How many times do I have to parade around and go,
1636000	1640000	look how fat and drunk I am before the AV club commenters
1640000	1642000	stop trying to blow the fucking lid off of it
1642000	1644000	like it's all the president's men or something.
1644000	1645000	It's not a secret.
1645000	1646000	But it hurts when you say it.
1646000	1647000	It hurts when you say it.
1648000	1650000	Because here's my one secret that I'm sensitive about.
1650000	1651000	I'm a control freak.
1651000	1652000	I don't want you saying it.
1652000	1653000	I say it.
1653000	1654000	I say it.
1654000	1655000	Me.
1657000	1660000	I don't like some fucking anonymous person sitting there
1660000	1662000	in their basement in Washington state.
1662000	1665000	It looks like somebody's been hitting the honking daws.
1665000	1666000	It's not fair.
1667000	1670000	That's not funny and it's not fair.
1670000	1672000	What show would you do?
1672000	1674000	I bet you'd rip off a podcast too.
1675000	1678000	Do what is talking about how fat people are.
1679000	1680000	Is that a podcast?
1681000	1683000	Is someone hosting that?
1683000	1684000	Surely someone is.
1684000	1685000	There should be.
1685000	1686000	Who's fat this week?
1686000	1687000	Let's take a look.
1688000	1690000	There should just be a comment section podcast
1690000	1695000	where it's just like, welcome to what just happened.
1698000	1700000	Caterpillar 69, I don't know.
1701000	1704000	I can't riff a name.
1704000	1707000	I just typed that in at random when I logged in.
1708000	1710000	So that just happened.
1710000	1713000	I'd rather die than watch that again.
1713000	1716000	They never tell you what they're commenting on, but they just...
1719000	1722000	With me as always is the person who's going to turn this into
1722000	1724000	either race or right versus left.
1724000	1725000	Exactly.
1727000	1731000	It's very hard when you know those things are there
1731000	1735000	and someone links to a thing that you've done.
1735000	1740000	It's very hard to have the self-control to not look at what people are saying.
1740000	1747000	Then knowing that right under there there's a bunch of fucking people talking about it
1747000	1749000	and they're weighing in on what they think.
1749000	1750000	It's so difficult.
1750000	1753000	The only good thing was when community was running at its peak
1753000	1756000	if there was a bad review of a show, it was like, this episode wasn't that great.
1756000	1758000	Then I'd go straight to the comment section.
1758000	1760000	I was like, have at them, boys.
1760000	1763000	Pick that skeleton clean.
1763000	1767000	There's something new to fucking eat up right above you.
1769000	1773000	I said to Spencer on the way home, I did it the 800th time.
1773000	1774000	I'm 43 years old.
1774000	1776000	I've learned this lesson over and over again.
1776000	1778000	I don't know why I went there.
1778000	1782000	The only thing you could say was it's just like picking a piece of glass up off the floor
1782000	1783000	and just stabbing yourself in the face.
1783000	1784000	I was in a really good mood.
1784000	1788000	I went there because you really have to run the thought experiment of seriously,
1788000	1795000	really seriously run the thought experiment of what happens the day that you click on the AV Club review
1795000	1798000	and it says, well, whatever the review says.
1798000	1800000	It's just a repeat of the press release.
1800000	1804000	But then the top comment says like, Harmon's never looked better.
1804000	1807000	I think this idea is very original.
1807000	1811000	I think he's on top of his game as ever.
1811000	1812000	Kudos to him.
1812000	1813000	Hats off to him.
1813000	1814000	Very funny.
1814000	1815000	Very young looking.
1815000	1816000	Very thin.
1816000	1817000	Very sober.
1817000	1819000	I salute you, sir.
1819000	1823000	And then every comment for a thousand comments was, couldn't agree more.
1823000	1824000	Ditto.
1824000	1826000	I second that.
1826000	1827000	Here, here.
1827000	1828000	I, I, I.
1828000	1829000	The eyes have it.
1829000	1834000	You would like scroll through that and then you'd go, well, I don't have to go there ever again.
1836000	1838000	Well, I don't know why I'm seeing the editorial you.
1838000	1839000	I, I would do.
1839000	1845000	I would scroll through and go, but that's not a real thing.
1845000	1851000	Wouldn't a part of like yourself loathing, wouldn't, I mean, I would say it's a hypothetical thing,
1851000	1855000	but wouldn't, wouldn't you just automatically distrust all of that unanimous praise?
1855000	1857000	Wouldn't you like find a way to?
1857000	1860000	That's what I just said.
1860000	1862000	Okay.
1862000	1866000	How dare you criticize me or agree with me.
1867000	1871000	Dan, you've, you've never looked better.
1871000	1874000	I could blow him off for the rest of the night.
1874000	1876000	That guy's on the hook.
1876000	1878000	He dragged a Kool-Aid.
1878000	1879000	I mean, that's terrible, right?
1879000	1883000	And then, you know, I always get mad when people tweet, they tweet at me and they go,
1883000	1887000	by the way, we'll ask you some questions later.
1887000	1890000	Are they about you?
1896000	1898000	Bingo.
1902000	1904000	I'll try to involve you in this, in this thing.
1904000	1905000	As best you can.
1905000	1914000	Have people ever tweeted you and said, hey, either, either positively or negatively,
1914000	1922000	but with the like handle on it of like, hey, I know you don't like it when people are positive, but.
1922000	1925000	Um, no.
1925000	1929000	So that's like, I've gotten that specific methodology.
1929000	1930000	I fostered some outside.
1930000	1933000	So like people will go like, you don't like it when people are positive.
1933000	1938000	So people, the two, the two categories of that sub people go, hey, I know, you know,
1938000	1940000	I know you don't respond to people being nice.
1940000	1943000	So fuck off and your show's awful.
1943000	1944000	And I'm like, okay, I get it.
1944000	1946000	We've run that through the periscope and the mirrors bouncing.
1946000	1947000	You're saying good show.
1947000	1948000	Fuck off.
1948000	1952000	Um, the, uh, then there's the, uh, actually the person that annoys me a little bit more
1952000	1956000	is the sweet, nice person who's saying, uh, uh, Hey, I just want to let you know.
1956000	1959000	I really like, uh, uh, Rick and morning.
1959000	1966000	Uh, uh, but, but, but, uh, I, I know you don't care about people who like your stuff.
1966000	1969000	So, but, but, but I thought I'd tell you anyway.
1969000	1971000	And I always take back those people.
1971000	1975000	Fuck you.
1975000	1976000	That's fair.
1976000	1981000	But now, but you, you interact with people a lot online, right?
1981000	1989000	So they know, but I mean, the thing is because I don't, I don't respond to a ton of people
1989000	1996000	and I don't, um, I don't really, I don't like respond to any, certainly not anything negative
1996000	2002000	unless I am a thousand percent sure that I am, uh, it doesn't bother me.
2002000	2003000	Do you know what I mean?
2003000	2007000	Like I can make a joke out of it and I can quote the thing that they said and make a joke out of it.
2007000	2010000	If I just think, oh, this is dumb and it doesn't actually hurt my feelings.
2010000	2013000	The, the, the, the, the, I just saw the hateful eight last night.
2013000	2019000	You're, you're the, the, the Tim Roth's character says, uh, if you're, if you're, if you're,
2019000	2027000	when you're hanging somebody, if it's, uh, if there's an ounce of passion to it, you maybe shouldn't be hanging them.
2027000	2031000	So when you're responding to a tweet, you're, I think that's what you're saying is like, you gotta,
2031000	2036000	you run it through a filter of like, am I, is there anything happening here where I'm just not like kind of like,
2036000	2044000	you know, a good professional like dealer or pit boss at the Tompkins casino, just, just doing my job, entertaining,
2044000	2047000	like, like, like making sure everybody's like being dealt with fairly.
2047000	2052000	Honestly, what it is, if, if it makes me laugh, if it's like someone's trying to say a mean thing,
2052000	2056000	but it just makes me laugh. I'm like, oh, this is great. And then I will tweet that out.
2056000	2062000	But I, so I don't, I don't respond a lot because it's like, where does, to me, it's like, where does it end?
2062000	2066000	You mean if someone insults you and it's funny, you'll retweet it. Is that what you're saying?
2066000	2070000	If they're trying to, if it's so absurd that it doesn't, it doesn't hurt his feelings. Like, yes.
2070000	2072000	If the intent was to hurt my feelings, but it failed.
2072000	2079000	Yeah. But, but if you, if you felt any wound or any passion in it or any like, I gotta, I gotta settle the score, you, you, you leave that.
2079000	2080000	I will not give it attention.
2080000	2081000	You leave that one alone.
2081000	2083000	Yes. That's very wise. That's very smart.
2083000	2089000	As a result, I think because you do interact with people so much, there are people that just want your attention in some way or another.
2089000	2103000	So, and I've seen this happen with other people where I've seen like somebody write like to, uh, I forget who it was, but they wrote a bunch of positive things, didn't get a response, and then wrote a negative thing just to get a response from this person.
2103000	2104000	Yeah, Dan.
2104000	2106000	And then they said, this is why I did this.
2106000	2114000	Dan, that has to be a huge, I'm sure you know this, that there has to be a giant part of people poking you is because they know that you might, you might fire back at them.
2114000	2130000	Right. But, but what I've, what I find over and over and over again is that there's that, that eventually they will, they will unfollow me and block me because they don't want just attention.
2130000	2136000	Like I'm obsessed with, I was obsessed with that, like going, going like, so that's the game we're playing.
2136000	2142000	Like you just want my attention because then they go through all the phases where they're like, what kind of loser are you paying attention to me?
2142000	2145000	And then it's like three days later, they're like, leave me alone.
2145000	2148000	And I'm like, are we, what are we done?
2148000	2151000	I want to talk to you.
2151000	2154000	You got Dan Harmon on the line, what's going on?
2154000	2159000	How's your mom? How's your blog?
2160000	2165000	Anyways, the, the, I would say that people like, like, absolutely, of course all this is true.
2165000	2174000	But when, when you, when you send a positive tweet to somebody, you know, no news is good news.
2174000	2178000	Like, like, like, you know, well, you, you, you, you pays your money and he takes your chances.
2178000	2181000	You know what I mean? Like you, you write a thing out there.
2181000	2185000	The idea is that you write a thing because this is genuinely how you feel.
2185000	2189000	It's not supposed to be about, you know, what you, of course you hope that someone will respond.
2189000	2195000	I've written positive things to people that I admired, you know, after like hearing an album or watching a TV show or whatever.
2195000	2200000	No response. And it's like, oh, it would have been nice if the person said something, but I didn't feel like I was owed that.
2200000	2201000	Tell us who.
2201000	2206000	It was Mariah Carey, Mariah Carey.
2206000	2210000	When she split up with Tommy Mottola, I was so proud of her.
2210000	2213000	And I was like, I wish someone would have been Twitter so I could tell her all about it.
2213000	2217000	I'm not good on the timeline with when Mariah Carey left Tommy Mottola.
2217000	2219000	I can't remember if Twitter was in our lives at that point.
2219000	2222000	Why is his mic so loud? Are you an auctioneer?
2222000	2225000	Yeah, I am.
2225000	2227000	I'm like a slow roll auctioneer.
2227000	2229000	Paul, I don't do the fast.
2229000	2231000	Paul, what is the next item up for auction?
2231000	2232000	What is the next item up for bid?
2232000	2235000	It is a pair of Jackalope antlers.
2235000	2242000	This whimsical gift can be found all over the Tex-Mex areas of the country.
2242000	2244000	What's our starting price?
2244000	2246000	One dollar.
2246000	2248000	Do I have a yup?
2248000	2251000	Is that my imagination?
2251000	2254000	I think he just got such a trained theater voice.
2254000	2257000	I'm also yelling.
2257000	2260000	Noah told me not to yell.
2260000	2262000	So I've been yelling the whole time.
2262000	2267000	I've never trusted these things.
2267000	2271000	Dan, what percentage of your replies to people,
2271000	2273000	do you ever reply to positive stuff?
2273000	2275000	Hey, thank you.
2275000	2277000	Does that even out?
2277000	2283000	Well, there have been days in the fucking 38 years I've been on Twitter, whatever it's been.
2283000	2288000	I've gone through different phases because that stuff got to me where I'd make sure I'd actually count.
2288000	2291000	And I'd go, okay, 50%.
2291000	2294000	Just to shove it up the ass of the people I hate.
2294000	2296000	I'm like, thank you, Nancy.
2296000	2299000	Very nice to be said.
2300000	2302000	Fucking asshole, that guy back there.
2302000	2306000	It's still worshipping at the altar of hatred.
2306000	2307000	Hey, Paul.
2307000	2309000	Where do you get your suits made?
2309000	2312000	I don't have a lot of suits made for myself.
2312000	2314000	I buy a lot of stuff off the rack.
2314000	2315000	You do.
2315000	2320000	I had my wedding suit made for me by Mr. Lee of Fairfax Avenue.
2320000	2323000	Very grumpy, Taylor, who did a wonderful job making my suit.
2323000	2325000	Taylor should be grumpy in my experience.
2325000	2328000	Is it true that Mr. Lee was killed by the Triads
2328000	2331000	for sharing his suitmaking secrets?
2332000	2335000	That's the story they'd like you to believe.
2335000	2338000	Now your mic is way too quiet.
2338000	2341000	It's because he's not yelling.
2341000	2346000	I thought we were getting quiet talking about the Triads.
2347000	2349000	It's called modulation, Dad.
2349000	2351000	He's got dynamism.
2351000	2353000	He's got levels.
2353000	2355000	Are you hearing me exclusively through the system?
2355000	2356000	I don't know what it is.
2357000	2359000	Because we're sitting a foot from each other.
2359000	2364000	When I listen to Jeff, we're amplified.
2364000	2368000	I don't know why it's taking me 200 shows to figure this out.
2368000	2370000	Why is this guy so loud?
2371000	2372000	What's that stick he's holding?
2372000	2374000	Why does he lick his ice cream cone?
2376000	2378000	Who eats black ice cream?
2378000	2380000	Whose ice cream matches their cone?
2382000	2384000	I bet that's a problem for someone.
2384000	2388000	I bet there's people that can't eat ice cream in a cone
2388000	2394000	because they would like the ice cream to be the same color as the cone.
2394000	2396000	So they're stuck with coffee.
2396000	2397000	Yeah.
2397000	2400000	Maybe some butter pecan would be a close.
2400000	2402000	You're talking about monochromophiliacs.
2402000	2403000	Yeah.
2406000	2408000	Yeah, I bet that's the case.
2408000	2411000	Let's make the rest of the show about that.
2411000	2413000	All right.
2414000	2415000	I dare us.
2416000	2418000	I mean, do you think it applies specifically to food?
2418000	2419000	It's just food.
2419000	2421000	I need all my food to be the same color.
2422000	2423000	I can't eat.
2423000	2425000	The fictional people?
2425000	2426000	What's that?
2427000	2428000	It's sexual.
2428000	2429000	It's sexual?
2429000	2430000	All right.
2430000	2431000	The perfect chime in.
2435000	2436000	That works for everything.
2436000	2438000	He says that every five minutes regardless of the topic.
2439000	2442000	Yesterday we were like, we do the show every day.
2444000	2450000	We're like, what's the real deal between the Hillary supporters and the Bernie supporters?
2450000	2451000	It's sexual.
2453000	2455000	Which is what got Gloria Steinem in all kinds of trouble.
2455000	2456000	Right.
2457000	2460000	But even a broken clock is right twice a day.
2460000	2466000	I don't know.
2466000	2470000	I guess when in doubt, you make the offended sound.
2470000	2471000	Does that want to be fun?
2471000	2472000	They were like, hey.
2474000	2475000	Wait, now, Paul.
2475000	2476000	Yes, yes, yes.
2476000	2477000	Paul.
2477000	2478000	Yes.
2478000	2479000	You had one suit.
2479000	2480000	You have one suit.
2480000	2482000	I'm assuming you still have it and you haven't had it destroyed.
2482000	2484000	It's a fantastic suit.
2484000	2485000	I never wear a suit more than one.
2487000	2488000	That is eccentric.
2488000	2489000	And I love that.
2489000	2492000	You have a suit that is exactly the mayor from Jaws' suit.
2492000	2493000	Yes.
2493000	2494000	With the anchors on it?
2494000	2495000	That suit I had made as well.
2495000	2496000	Of course.
2496000	2497000	You didn't get that off the rack.
2497000	2499000	That was made by Cebo.
2500000	2501000	Not far from here.
2502000	2505000	A few doors down from the improv, this guy Cebo makes...
2505000	2507000	He was recommended to me by Dana Gould.
2507000	2508000	Very funny comedian.
2508000	2509000	I love Dana Gould.
2509000	2518000	And I had wanted, since I was a child, the blazer that the mayor wears in Jaws.
2518000	2519000	It's covered with anchors.
2519000	2521000	It's like a powder blue kind of thing.
2521000	2522000	It's beautiful.
2522000	2524000	It's triumphant.
2524000	2527000	It is triumphant.
2528000	2531000	It is a sartorial triumph.
2531000	2533000	And so I searched everywhere for it.
2533000	2534000	Who's not an actor's name?
2534000	2535000	Sorry.
2535000	2536000	Larry...
2536000	2537000	No, Larry...
2537000	2538000	Larry King.
2538000	2539000	Larry Storch.
2539000	2540000	Larry...
2540000	2541000	Larry Gilmore.
2541000	2542000	Big boy.
2542000	2543000	Shit.
2543000	2544000	Damn it.
2544000	2545000	Sensible brother.
2545000	2546000	No, the character's name is Larry.
2546000	2547000	Larry Vaughn.
2547000	2548000	All right.
2548000	2549000	No, we'll look at him.
2549000	2550000	Sorry.
2550000	2551000	Murray Hamilton.
2551000	2552000	Murray Hamilton.
2552000	2553000	Okay.
2553000	2554000	Now you're yelling.
2554000	2555000	Now you're yelling.
2555000	2556000	It's sexual.
2557000	2558000	See?
2559000	2560000	That didn't even apply.
2562000	2564000	So I searched high and low for this jacket.
2564000	2565000	Oh, tell him.
2565000	2566000	He's the one that cares about your suit.
2566000	2567000	That's true.
2568000	2569000	So I searched high and low.
2569000	2571000	There's two different podcasts going on here.
2573000	2576000	I couldn't find the jacket itself.
2576000	2578000	But then I talked about it.
2579000	2582000	I talked about it on another podcast.
2582000	2585000	And someone sent me a link to the material.
2585000	2586000	It started...
2586000	2588000	And they said, here's where you can find this material.
2588000	2590000	They have the material laying about?
2590000	2591000	They have the material laying about.
2591000	2592000	It's close enough.
2592000	2593000	Close enough.
2593000	2594000	Close enough.
2594000	2596000	And so I get a few yards of this fabric and I take it to...
2596000	2597000	Cebo.
2597000	2599000	The Maestro Cebo.
2599000	2600000	And he's very excited.
2600000	2601000	He likes making unusual stuff.
2601000	2602000	Right.
2602000	2603000	So he was very excited.
2603000	2605000	And it was perfect.
2606000	2609000	It was like I had enough material to make not just the jacket but an entire suit.
2609000	2610000	Entire three-piece suit.
2610000	2611000	You made the vest too?
2611000	2612000	Yeah.
2612000	2613000	Fantastic.
2613000	2614000	All right.
2614000	2615000	I'm going to go back to my podium, Paul.
2615000	2616000	Great talking to you.
2616000	2617000	Jeff, always a pleasure.
2617000	2618000	That was a...
2620000	2624000	That was a taste of Jeff's new Feral audio podcast.
2628000	2629000	Jeff on the...
2630000	2631000	Suits.
2631000	2632000	Meats.
2637000	2638000	Listen for it.
2639000	2640000	It's sexual.
2646000	2648000	How long have you been married?
2648000	2649000	I've been married.
2649000	2652000	It will be six years this month.
2653000	2654000	Wow.
2654000	2655000	Okay.
2655000	2656000	Was that allowed?
2656000	2657000	Did they turn my mic up?
2657000	2658000	It will be six years this month.
2658000	2659000	I'm sorry.
2659000	2660000	Paul, we didn't get that.
2660000	2661000	Can we do it again?
2661000	2663000	I will be married six years this month.
2667000	2669000	Yeah.
2670000	2671000	So it took.
2671000	2672000	It took.
2672000	2673000	So far so good.
2674000	2675000	It took.
2676000	2677000	What's your secret, Paul?
2677000	2679000	What's you and your wife's secret?
2680000	2682000	We don't spend a lot of time together.
2683000	2685000	We have separate residences.
2686000	2688000	Never actually got married.
2688000	2689000	We're not married.
2691000	2692000	And it's great.
2693000	2694000	She's a mirror.
2697000	2700000	I get dressed up as a parakeet and just pack her.
2700000	2703000	I put lipstick on the mirror so I know it's not me.
2704000	2705000	It's not another me.
2706000	2707000	I'm like, oh, I thought that was a...
2708000	2709000	Why are your lips...
2712000	2716000	I don't think that six years is long enough to say,
2716000	2718000	here's the secret to marriage.
2718000	2719000	It is now.
2722000	2723000	It's getting pretty close.
2724000	2727000	But I think that we're going to go the distance,
2727000	2728000	but you don't know.
2729000	2730000	You don't know.
2730000	2732000	And you just try as hard as you can.
2733000	2734000	That's all I know so far.
2735000	2737000	Those were your vows, which I thought were so romantic.
2737000	2738000	Look.
2739000	2740000	Who knows what's going to happen?
2742000	2745000	We might look back on this two months from now
2745000	2746000	and be like, what the fuck?
2748000	2749000	Catch as catch can.
2750000	2752000	That's how my vows started.
2753000	2754000	Any port in the storm.
2756000	2758000	I don't want to be alone.
2759000	2762000	How long were you guys together before you were married?
2762000	2764000	Jeff, I'm going to say...
2765000	2767000	We were together for five years before we got married.
2767000	2768000	Holy smoke.
2768000	2770000	Wow. Well, see, there's a good secret right there.
2770000	2772000	It's like it has something to do with ratio,
2772000	2773000	like a sailboat, actually.
2773000	2776000	You know, there's more sailboat going on underneath the water.
2776000	2777000	Ooh, it's sexual.
2781000	2782000	You're lead up, you know?
2782000	2783000	Yeah.
2785000	2787000	Which is not to say anybody who's listening,
2787000	2789000	oh, you know, you dated for three months
2789000	2790000	and you love each other to get married.
2790000	2792000	I'm just saying, like, people who...
2792000	2794000	Shrob, I officiated his wedding.
2794000	2797000	He'd been living with Kate for seven years.
2797000	2799000	I mean, give me a break.
2799000	2802000	They're not going to, like, come home from the wedding
2802000	2804000	and be like, you chew your cereal.
2805000	2807000	Like, I know, I know.
2807000	2809000	Why don't you chew your cereal?
2810000	2812000	You're going to choke to death.
2812000	2815000	I am sick of giving you the Heimlich every morning.
2817000	2820000	Because it dilutes the taste to chew it.
2822000	2826000	And yet, ironically, the generations preceding us,
2826000	2831000	as the sort of aversion to living in sin increases,
2831000	2834000	so does, it seems, the longevity of the marriage, right?
2834000	2837000	Shrob's parents were... who probably...
2837000	2838000	I'm going to guess.
2838000	2840000	I don't want to get invasive here.
2840000	2841000	Probably didn't bone till our wedding night.
2841000	2842000	I don't know.
2842000	2843000	They married right out of high school.
2843000	2844000	They were here on the show.
2844000	2845000	They were boning, baby.
2845000	2848000	They've been married 50 years and it's like,
2848000	2851000	oh, my God, it's sexual.
2854000	2855000	I don't know.
2857000	2858000	Who knows? I don't know.
2858000	2860000	Wait, where's this going?
2860000	2862000	Well, I mean, that's the thing, is that there's no...
2862000	2864000	I don't think there's any...
2864000	2865000	I don't think there are any guarantees
2865000	2868000	and I don't think anyone...
2868000	2871000	People are individuals and they have their own methods
2871000	2872000	of doing things.
2872000	2875000	And anyone who has something successful,
2875000	2877000	whether it's a career, whether it's a marriage, whatever,
2877000	2880000	they assume that their way is the only way
2880000	2882000	because results speak for themselves.
2882000	2885000	But that advice might not apply to other individuals.
2885000	2887000	It's like you just can't live your life
2887000	2889000	by other people's example.
2889000	2891000	What if we all applied the Jim Belushi method
2891000	2894000	of becoming as famous as Jim Belushi?
2895000	2898000	Where we made our brothers become famous first?
2898000	2901000	Listen, you're going to help me out here.
2901000	2902000	I need you to become famous then.
2902000	2905000	Get out of the way, if you know what I mean.
2905000	2906000	Everyone misses you.
2906000	2909000	They're like, he kind of looks like him.
2909000	2912000	You know what, Paul? Easy target. Come on.
2917000	2918000	But what's that...
2918000	2919000	I don't know anything about it
2919000	2921000	because I don't talk about anything but myself.
2922000	2924000	What is your wife...
2924000	2925000	What is she?
2928000	2930000	Is she a space man?
2930000	2932000	She's an assassin sent to kill you
2932000	2934000	but has she thought better?
2934000	2936000	She's like, turn around and you did?
2936000	2937000	And she's like, whoa.
2938000	2939000	Was it like Willow?
2941000	2943000	Accidental love potion?
2943000	2945000	I don't remember a lot about Willow.
2945000	2947000	But Willow...
2947000	2949000	Who was Willow in Willow?
2949000	2950000	Which character was Willow?
2950000	2951000	Willow was...
2951000	2952000	The little fellow?
2953000	2954000	What's his fuss?
2954000	2955000	Warwick?
2955000	2956000	Warwick Davis. Thank you.
2956000	2957000	It's sexual.
2957000	2959000	I ended up waving at this person.
2961000	2962000	But yeah.
2962000	2963000	Val Kilmer and...
2963000	2964000	Who was Matt Martigan?
2964000	2965000	Was that Val Kilmer?
2965000	2966000	That was Val Kilmer.
2966000	2967000	Okay.
2967000	2969000	And I know that Rick Overton was in that movie.
2969000	2970000	Was he really?
2970000	2973000	Yeah, Rick Overton and Kevin Pollack were two brownies.
2973000	2974000	They were like little tiny guys.
2974000	2975000	I love Rick Overton.
2975000	2976000	Right?
2976000	2977000	Yeah.
2977000	2978000	Thank you.
2978000	2979000	French brownies.
2979000	2980000	French brownies?
2980000	2981000	They were kind of doing a French thing, right?
2981000	2982000	Fun.
2983000	2985000	I gotta check this movie out again.
2986000	2988000	Aren't French brownies soufflés or something?
2991000	2992000	Eclair?
2992000	2993000	They don't call them brownies in France.
2993000	2995000	Is she a civilian, your wife?
2995000	2996000	Yeah, she's an actress.
2998000	2999000	Is she Nicole Kidman?
3000000	3001000	She is not Nicole Kidman?
3001000	3003000	You have three guesses left.
3004000	3009000	Alright, I'm gonna guess based on actual, like, good matches for you.
3018000	3019000	Is your wife...
3024000	3025000	Paul Rudd?
3027000	3028000	That would be great.
3029000	3030000	Very close.
3031000	3032000	Paul Rudd.
3032000	3033000	Paul Rudd.
3034000	3035000	Rudd Smith?
3038000	3039000	Alright, she's an actor.
3039000	3041000	We won't drag her into this.
3046000	3049000	I'm happy to tell you more if you would like to know.
3050000	3051000	Tell us about your wife.
3051000	3052000	Her name is Janie.
3053000	3054000	She is an actress.
3055000	3056000	She is from South Carolina.
3057000	3059000	We met in 2003 through Mutual Friends.
3060000	3061000	Who were the Mutual Friends?
3061000	3062000	The Mutual Friends are...
3064000	3065000	Paul Rudd.
3065000	3066000	Nicole Kidman.
3067000	3068000	And Paul Rudd Smith.
3069000	3072000	Interestingly, we both sort of knew Paul Rudd independently of each other.
3073000	3083000	And my wife spent her, I want to say, 30th birthday at the disgusting karaoke bar primetime here in Los Angeles with Paul Rudd.
3084000	3086000	And some other people, she was working at...
3087000	3089000	I believe she was working at MBAR at the time as a waitress.
3090000	3092000	She was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar when I met her.
3093000	3094000	Did you meet her doing...
3095000	3096000	She literally was.
3097000	3098000	Did you MBAR then...
3099000	3101000	Did you perchance meet her doing Beth Lapita's show?
3102000	3103000	No, I did not.
3104000	3109000	I did not set foot into MBAR, I think, until after we had started dating already.
3110000	3111000	So I met her at a different bar.
3112000	3114000	And I was leaving as she was arriving.
3115000	3116000	We overlapped briefly and we met then.
3117000	3118000	Paul, what year did you...
3120000	3121000	I'm right behind you.
3122000	3123000	Where did you move to LA from?
3124000	3125000	Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
3126000	3126000	
3127000	3128000	1994.
3129000	3135000	Now, I remember seeing you in a very early days stand-up show at the Onyx Cafe on Vermont, which is no longer there.
3136000	3137000	Yes.
3138000	3139000	And it was really early days and I'd never seen you before.
3140000	3141000	Also, it was the first time I ever saw Sarah Silverman.
3142000	3143000	Sure.
3143000	3145000	I think it might have been Tenacious D's first show they ever did was there.
3146000	3148000	I think their first show was at Al's Bar.
3149000	3150000	Oh, really?
3150000	3152000	I talked to Jack with us and he goes, that might have been our first or second show, but he wasn't sure.
3153000	3154000	Second.
3158000	3159000	But I've got to say, I remember two things about you.
3160000	3161000	I remember, okay, this guy's really funny.
3162000	3165000	And I liked your style and you had a great vocabulary and a great command of the English language.
3166000	3167000	But also, your suit rumbled.
3168000	3169000	You had a rumbled suit.
3170000	3171000	And then I was like, that's the guy with the rumbled suit.
3172000	3174000	But now you've become this exquisitely dressed gentleman.
3175000	3176000	And I love that about you.
3177000	3180000	I think I just could not afford to have things not rumbled in those days.
3181000	3183000	I think that was like all of us back then.
3184000	3185000	See, when I first saw you.
3187000	3188000	Suit.
3189000	3190000	Smooth as silk.
3191000	3193000	I thought, could you be a little funnier?
3194000	3195000	Sure.
3197000	3198000	So, I don't know if that was...
3199000	3200000	Still true.
3202000	3204000	I don't know. I thought I'd invert the dichotomy.
3205000	3206000	I guess that's what I was doing.
3207000	3208000	Are you still doing that speakeasy show?
3209000	3210000	No. I resigned from that.
3211000	3213000	I did it for a while and I enjoyed doing it for a while.
3214000	3216000	It was an interview series and I interviewed Dan on it.
3217000	3219000	And we had a lovely chat, but it's still available.
3220000	3221000	You can still find it on YouTube.
3222000	3227000	But I did it for a while and then it just became another thing to schedule in my life.
3228000	3230000	And the returns were diminishing.
3231000	3232000	Because we would shoot them four at a time.
3233000	3237000	And so, the first couple interviews, this is fun. This is great.
3238000	3239000	Then Mark Maron came in.
3242000	3245000	And you walked away from that one and you were like, what am I doing?
3247000	3250000	I did it so long after Mark Maron, believe it or not.
3251000	3254000	I just conjured that name for maximum self-destructiveness.
3256000	3260000	But it was fun for a while, but then I eventually had other things going on.
3261000	3263000	And it just wasn't... Stop being fun. Stop being fun.
3264000	3270000	You will find when you come and do this show for history, for the history flux,
3271000	3275000	that I am approaching that Event Horizon burnout.
3276000	3278000	I may be a husk of a man when you're...
3279000	3280000	How many have you shot so far?
3282000	3283000	I've lost count, which is good.
3284000	3285000	Something like nine.
3286000	3287000	Nine or ten. They've all been great.
3288000	3289000	Who's that over there?
3290000	3291000	How's it going?
3292000	3293000	I see you.
3294000	3295000	Spencer, have you been here this whole time?
3296000	3300000	Yeah, I didn't have anything to chime in until just right there.
3302000	3304000	About nine, you know.
3307000	3308000	That's what I got.
3309000	3311000	Spencer, are you enjoying being an actor on the show? You have a good time?
3312000	3317000	It's weird. I mean, the hard part about acting, as best I could tell, is memorizing and reciting lines.
3318000	3323000	We kind of do it all improv-y style, so it's just like, whatever you think of to say, just say it.
3324000	3326000	It's a lot easier when you're not trying to hit lines.
3327000	3332000	Yeah. By the way, I know it gets frustrating when I come in and I go,
3333000	3335000	this script is done. We'll throw it out. We're going to improvise and stuff.
3336000	3342000	But then when you did a whole scene, he did, what, an hour and a half, two hours of straight improv with Nick Kroll.
3343000	3347000	Kroll, I'm not spoiling anything. Kroll plays Sigmund Freud.
3348000	3352000	And he psychoanalyzed Spencer for two hours.
3353000	3355000	It was all one take.
3356000	3359000	And Spencer just answered honestly.
3360000	3363000	The perfect actor. You were acting perfectly.
3364000	3369000	And then Steve Levy came in and played himself, and he did it perfectly, too.
3370000	3372000	But we're not going to do two-hour takes, right?
3373000	3374000	No, no.
3375000	3378000	Are we allowed to know who Paul is going to portray?
3379000	3381000	Yeah, unless you have some reason to not...
3382000	3386000	I'm cool with this. I'm cool with it being out there.
3387000	3389000	I like teasing it. I believe you're going to play Edgar Allen Poe.
3390000	3391000	That's correct.
3393000	3394000	A lot of Poe fans.
3395000	3404000	Who has figured it into my life in a weird way because the place where my wife grew up on Sullivan's Island, South Carolina, there's a lot of Poe stuff there because he spent...
3405000	3410000	As Edgar Allen Poe seemingly did all over the fucking place, he spent a good amount of his life there.
3411000	3417000	And his story, The Gold Bug, is inspired by Gold Bug Island there in South Carolina.
3418000	3419000	What happens in The Gold Bug?
3420000	3421000	I have no idea.
3421000	3424000	I remember The Gold Bug from the Richard Scarry novels.
3425000	3426000	Who's a children's author.
3427000	3430000	Is it scary or scarry? I never knew how to pronounce his name.
3431000	3432000	Oh, I always said scary.
3433000	3434000	Because he's got the two R's.
3435000	3436000	Either way, it's terrifying.
3437000	3438000	Either way, it's terrifying.
3439000	3442000	There's a kids show and they said scary, so I think, yeah, it's scary.
3443000	3444000	Oh, you're going to trust LaVar Burton?
3445000	3446000	I don't know.
3447000	3448000	Yeah.
3449000	3450000	How's that working out for you?
3451000	3453000	He said he was going to come to my wedding, remember?
3454000	3455000	He doesn't want to pronounce anything.
3458000	3460000	That's probably why I got divorced with LaVar.
3463000	3467000	And he'll fire back, no, that's why I didn't come because I knew you weren't going to stay married.
3468000	3470000	It's going to go back and forth, it's going to be a whole thing.
3471000	3472000	Me and LaVar Burton.
3473000	3478000	And then it's like you have to go back through the tweets to see where it started, like who was the first one to say something.
3479000	3483000	And it's like it all starts with him going like, hey, I know you don't respond to positive shit, so fuck off.
3486000	3487000	Do you have children?
3488000	3489000	No.
3490000	3491000	That sounds like you don't want to.
3492000	3493000	Nothing against them.
3494000	3495000	No, I don't think we do.
3496000	3497000	I don't think we do. Not looking for it.
3498000	3499000	Here's something against children.
3500000	3501000	Too many of them.
3502000	3503000	There's plenty to go around.
3504000	3505000	They can be as offended as they want of that.
3506000	3509000	Anyway, do you think children themselves would be offended?
3510000	3511000	Hey!
3512000	3513000	We're children.
3514000	3517000	Well, who would be? Like two people who had kids and they're like, they're listening with the kid.
3518000	3519000	That's who would be offended.
3520000	3521000	Hey, we had kids.
3522000	3523000	Well, yeah, more food for him.
3524000	3525000	More food for him.
3527000	3528000	Somebody's got to stop.
3529000	3532000	The hardest part of being a parent is going to where the child food is kept.
3532000	3535000	And there's like all these other children.
3536000	3537000	And it's like, how are we going to get in there?
3538000	3539000	Because they're just like, the kids are like, spit over the trough.
3540000	3541000	And they're just like.
3543000	3545000	And then a kid falls in. Red light goes on.
3546000	3547000	Everyone out.
3548000	3550000	We got an Augustus Klum situation here.
3558000	3559000	Do you want to be a dad?
3560000	3571000	I'm so old now anyway, like, who cares? You know, like, I don't know.
3572000	3576000	I used to think like the second half of a full life would, you know, involve having kids.
3577000	3579000	But like, I'm now post divorce.
3580000	3588000	I'm like, sort of, I figure I made mistakes that affected other people's lives by making assumptions about what I was supposed to do.
3589000	3590000	What I wanted to do.
3594000	3595000	It's sexual.
3600000	3605000	And so I'm just sort of in this clean slate kind of mode where I'm fetishizing uncertainty.
3606000	3610000	My therapist told me, don't be certain about anything. Dan Harmon.
3611000	3612000	Oh, it's very formal.
3613000	3614000	Yeah.
3615000	3618000	She said, I in particular have a problem with certainty.
3619000	3620000	Well, who doesn't?
3621000	3623000	I mean, I sure lack homes like you.
3624000	3625000	It's a good man.
3625000	3626000	You fucking nailed it.
3629000	3630000	Look, I asked an answer.
3630000	3631000	Moving on.
3632000	3633000	Mr. Rourke.
3635000	3636000	The car and Knight Rider kit.
3637000	3640000	I am on the verge of rewatching Fantasy Island.
3641000	3644000	I don't want to remake that show.
3645000	3648000	Do you remember when they remade it with what's his name with Malcolm McDowell?
3649000	3650000	They did it for. Yeah.
3651000	3652000	There was a brief.
3652000	3653000	I mean, not not Malcolm McDowell.
3653000	3654000	I don't care.
3654000	3655000	You're fine.
3655000	3656000	There was a brief weird remake with.
3657000	3658000	I don't.
3658000	3666000	I mean, like, because it's I just Chris McKenna and I are always talking about Fantasy Island because I it's like there was the show, kids.
3666000	3669000	It was a it was it was it was prime time.
3669000	3672000	It was it was it was as well regarded as Orange is the New Black.
3672000	3675000	It was like it was we didn't have.
3675000	3676000	We didn't have.
3676000	3677000	We didn't.
3677000	3680000	We hadn't splintered our audience into a million pieces back then.
3680000	3681000	It was like the.
3681000	3682000	Hold on a second.
3682000	3685000	I feel that is a tad misleading.
3687000	3694000	No one was talking about Fantasy Island the way they talk about Orange is the New Black.
3694000	3695000	I don't know if that's.
3696000	3697000	I mean, what?
3697000	3698000	At the water cooler?
3698000	3699000	Just going.
3699000	3700000	Did you see it last night?
3700000	3701000	Yes, I did.
3701000	3702000	They talked about it.
3702000	3704000	But I would not say it was held in the same regard.
3705000	3706000	As this.
3706000	3709000	I felt that Fanta Town dealt with queer issues pretty much the same way.
3709000	3710000	Yeah.
3711000	3714000	You guys are talking about content and specificity of that stuff.
3714000	3715000	I'm talking about culturally.
3715000	3717000	Back then there were three networks.
3718000	3722000	The Incredible Hulk series won the Emmy for best dramatic series.
3724000	3726000	It was a pretty dramatic show in all fairness.
3727000	3732000	The winner of the best best female lead in a dramatic series was the Bionic Woman.
3733000	3735000	It was before they changed the name of the category.
3736000	3737000	Wait, what is it?
3738000	3739000	I think it's best actress.
3739000	3740000	That's sexist.
3741000	3743000	It used to be best best female lead.
3749000	3754000	Anyways, Fantasy Island was a show where a seaplane would land and a guy.
3754000	3756000	We're going from the very beginning.
3758000	3759000	They don't know.
3760000	3762000	A guy in a white suit would come out.
3762000	3770000	Because first what would happen is a little person would go d'plane, d'plane, boss, d'plane.
3770000	3771000	And then the seaplane would land.
3771000	3773000	It would be this title sequence from Fantasy Island.
3773000	3776000	Fantasy Island is a resort where all your fantasies come true.
3776000	3779000	Now, you're going to have a million questions in a second.
3779000	3783000	Because a seaplane would land and three guest stars would get off.
3783000	3785000	Same as the Love Boat except on the Love Boat.
3785000	3787000	Jacqueline Bassett would get off.
3788000	3789000	And Robert Wagner.
3790000	3792000	And Ernest Borknan.
3793000	3796000	And Tatoo would go, who's that boss?
3796000	3801000	And Mr. Rourke would say, Tatoo, that is William Salkind.
3801000	3805000	He wishes he could be a concert pianist.
3806000	3808000	Three people getting off the plane.
3808000	3814000	But the resort was, and then so what would happen to Mr. Salkind is he would end up being a concert pianist,
3814000	3816000	but he would also find out he didn't really want to be, right?
3816000	3818000	Everyone would learn a lesson.
3818000	3821000	It was like they should have called it fucking O. Henry Island.
3821000	3824000	They should have called it the Better Business Bureau because...
3825000	3828000	But everyone was satisfied at the end.
3828000	3830000	Everyone was satisfied at the end.
3830000	3832000	They were all like, hey, guess what, Mr. Rourke?
3832000	3838000	You pulled a fast one, but I got to admit, you made me realize I didn't want to be a concert pianist after all.
3838000	3840000	So now I can stop thinking about it.
3840000	3844000	And then during the credits, which you wouldn't see, Mr. Rourke would pull each aside and go,
3844000	3846000	thank you so much.
3846000	3850000	If you would be so kind as to tell no one about what goes on here...
3850000	3852000	Please don't reveal the shocking secret.
3852000	3856000	Then no one will ever come here because you may all be leaving and thinking,
3856000	3864000	oh, thank you so much for showing me that my fantasy about being a gentleman in the 1800s
3864000	3870000	led to my misogyny and I had to solve it and all this shit, but no one's going to come here for that.
3870000	3872000	No one's coming to learn a lesson.
3872000	3874000	No one got their fantasy.
3874000	3876000	Everyone got it right up to me.
3876000	3878000	Nobody ever got what they wanted, ever?
3878000	3880000	They got what they wanted and then some.
3880000	3882000	They all walked away going, huh, I shouldn't have wanted that.
3882000	3884000	Nobody said...
3884000	3886000	Which is not what you get from Cheetos.
3886000	3888000	Wait, yes it is.
3888000	3893000	Then there would be some little nerdy dude who's like, I want to be a big he-man or whatever.
3893000	3895000	I want to be a cool guy.
3895000	3899000	And then he would discover that the coolness was within him the whole time.
3899000	3902000	Which means, yeah, he had to clean the pool.
3902000	3904000	He's like, when's my fantasy going to start?
3904000	3908000	Don't you understand? When that guy picked on you, you stood up to him.
3908000	3910000	What the fuck?
3910000	3913000	I gave you like five million dollars.
3913000	3918000	They never got into how much it had to cost to have your fantasy.
3918000	3919000	Here's the other thing.
3919000	3920000	It had to be expensive.
3920000	3921000	It had to be expensive.
3921000	3922000	So every establishing shot...
3922000	3925000	If they're hiring actors, they're putting people in alien costumes.
3925000	3927000	Prohibitively expensive.
3927000	3928000	Prohibitively expensive.
3928000	3929000	Paul.
3929000	3930000	Costumes?
3930000	3932000	Mr. Rourke was magical.
3932000	3933000	Well now, hold on a second.
3933000	3936000	Hold on a second.
3936000	3943000	In later seasons, it was revealed that Mr. Rourke had mysterious supernatural powers,
3943000	3946000	and we learned this when he had to do battle with...
3946000	3947000	The devil.
3947000	3949000	Portrayed by...
3949000	3950000	Portrayed by...
3950000	3953000	Who's your number one pick to play Satan?
3953000	3955000	Well, Ricardo Montalbate in a split screen, but...
3955000	3956000	That would have been great.
3956000	3959000	That actually would have made a lot more sense.
3959000	3964000	But if you can't do that, let's say Ricardo, he's got terrible back pain.
3964000	3965000	It's all he can do.
3965000	3966000	This is actually true.
3966000	3971000	It's all he can do to shoot like just Mr. Rourke's parts.
3971000	3975000	Of course, you go out to Roddy McDowell.
3975000	3976000	Roddy McDowell played Satan.
3976000	3977000	Well, that's good.
3977000	3979000	Okay, so you're...
3979000	3981000	You know more about Fantastic Island than I do.
3981000	3984000	You're saying there was a casino royale era of fantasy.
3984000	3988000	There was a era of fantasy island that was pre-supernatural.
3988000	3989000	I think where they didn't...
3989000	3992000	Yeah, they did not acknowledge that he had powers.
3992000	3993000	Because I saw...
3993000	3998000	All I remember is like two women that wanted to experience adventure or something,
3998000	4001000	and they woke up in dinosaur times.
4001000	4008000	And there were cavemen trying to ravish them, whatever the 80s term for it is.
4008000	4010000	And then Mr. Rourke came out of the woods going,
4011000	4014000	But he was like prosthetically done up like a caveman.
4014000	4016000	And then he ripped off his mask.
4016000	4017000	But he was Mr. Rourke.
4017000	4020000	But it was like they were dinosaurs, I remember.
4020000	4022000	Anyways, my question is this.
4022000	4024000	When they would show...
4024000	4026000	So they would cut their interstitials.
4026000	4027000	They would go like,
4027000	4029000	Oh, that person's fantasy is going on.
4029000	4030000	He's a concert pianist.
4030000	4032000	That woman's in dinosaur times.
4034000	4037000	Mr. Rourke and Tattoo would be walking or somebody would be walking.
4037000	4039000	And go like, fantasy is going on.
4039000	4040000	What an island.
4040000	4046000	And in the background, there's all these people that aren't working there.
4046000	4047000	They're customers too.
4047000	4049000	They didn't get off the sea plane.
4049000	4051000	What package did they get?
4051000	4053000	And how much of their fantasies are happening?
4053000	4055000	Are they just getting anal beads?
4055000	4058000	Like they don't get greeted by Mr. Rourke.
4058000	4060000	That's like Captain Steubing's table.
4060000	4063000	Maybe there's flights happening all day long.
4063000	4065000	We just get to see one or two, you know, like a week.
4065000	4067000	Well, Tattoo does say...
4067000	4069000	Da planes.
4069000	4071000	Right?
4071000	4074000	He doesn't say one of da planes.
4074000	4075000	Yeah.
4075000	4077000	Another plane, boss.
4077000	4078000	Also...
4078000	4080000	The 815.
4080000	4081000	The 815.
4081000	4086000	Why is the briefing happening as the people are getting off of the plane?
4086000	4088000	He's like, who's this one, boss?
4088000	4090000	He's like, oh, I guess I should have told you this.
4090000	4092000	Why does Tattoo have to know?
4092000	4093000	Also, Tattoo...
4093000	4094000	What's his job?
4094000	4098000	His job just to alert him to the presence of the plane?
4098000	4102000	Listen, Tattoo, I put a folder in your room every morning.
4102000	4107000	I don't even know why I go to the trouble of trying to put these dossies together.
4107000	4109000	Boss, what about my fantasy?
4109000	4113000	Tattoo, illiteracy does not count as a fantasy.
4113000	4116000	You're just being lazy.
4116000	4118000	My fantasy is you learn to read.
4118000	4122000	There was an episode where Tattoo had to be a space man.
4122000	4124000	He had to be a little Martian.
4124000	4128000	And he had to put on green makeup and a bald cap and everything.
4128000	4134000	So it's very unclear as to how this whole operation works.
4134000	4136000	And I think that in the earlier...
4136000	4139000	Before Satan shows up, they tried to...
4139000	4141000	I think the idea was that it was just mysterious.
4141000	4142000	Like, how do you do this?
4142000	4144000	He's like, I wouldn't you like to know?
4144000	4146000	It's 9-11.
4147000	4148000	Yes.
4148000	4149000	It's a plane.
4149000	4150000	All right.
4150000	4151000	Oh, Paul.
4151000	4152000	Well, what's happening?
4152000	4153000	Paul.
4153000	4157000	We at Harmanstown cheer when it's 9-11 on the clock.
4158000	4160000	It's a rich history.
4160000	4165000	I'm glad to see that people never forget to do that.
4169000	4173000	Even a broken clock, it's 9-11 twice a day.
4176000	4182000	A broken clock remembers twice.
4183000	4186000	But five years from now, when McKenna and I do that,
4186000	4187000	because we want to write this pilot,
4187000	4190000	and it's just this is not gold bullion idea either.
4190000	4192000	And I'm sure you've come up with it as well.
4192000	4196000	But like the ultimate workplace comedy is just like...
4196000	4197000	Yeah.
4197000	4199000	The behind the scenes of Fantasy Island.
4199000	4203000	It's like you're the house stealer.
4203000	4204000	Clean the room.
4204000	4207000	And it's like, what the fucking lizard skin?
4207000	4208000	And it's like, what's going on?
4208000	4210000	You know, it's like some people getting drawn in.
4210000	4214000	And it's like, you have to put on this wizard costume.
4214000	4215000	What is that contract like?
4215000	4216000	Like, you must sign.
4216000	4219000	There's got to be so many things that you're just signing away.
4219000	4223000	Like, look, a vampire might attack you.
4223000	4224000	Yeah.
4224000	4229000	And I'm sorry, but you either want to work here or you don't.
4229000	4232000	I bet you find out if you talk to a worker at Fantasy Island long enough.
4232000	4240000	I bet you find out that there's a tiny dot right under their hairline.
4240000	4243000	And there's some weird microsurgery that's happened
4243000	4245000	where they've been lobotomized.
4245000	4246000	I bet you're right.
4246000	4251000	Or it's magic and they just forget when they fly out of the fog of Fantasy Island.
4251000	4254000	But when the supernatural thing...
4254000	4256000	Can you imagine the Fantasy Island writers room?
4256000	4258000	Because you know the showrunner was like,
4258000	4261000	guys, guys, guys, we've been over this.
4261000	4264000	The minute we jump that shark, people are going to ask,
4264000	4266000	why does Mr. Rourke need money?
4266000	4269000	Like, why is he running a business?
4269000	4273000	I think if you asked, if you created a Fantasy Island right now
4273000	4275000	and you said, okay, I'm hiring,
4275000	4279000	does anybody want to live on an island and role play all day long?
4279000	4281000	We've been to the Renaissance Fair.
4281000	4282000	I think you could find people...
4282000	4286000	I bet there's 10 people here who want to do that.
4286000	4288000	It's high stakes larping, man.
4288000	4291000	People will be all over that shit.
4291000	4293000	Oh, you've got to be a concert piano teacher.
4293000	4294000	I used to be a concert.
4294000	4295000	They would love it.
4295000	4296000	They'd freak out.
4296000	4297000	You've got to play an alien.
4297000	4299000	You've got to get killed by a vampire.
4299000	4300000	That'd be the best.
4300000	4304000	That'd be a great, kind of a murder mystery kind of evening
4304000	4306000	where there was no...
4306000	4310000	You're just like, one person has to be the pianist, but...
4310000	4311000	I don't know.
4311000	4312000	I guess it just stops there.
4312000	4314000	It was like someone's just at the piano.
4314000	4315000	Wait, did it start?
4316000	4317000	I was just imagining.
4317000	4320000	I mean, at that point in the show where I'm so drunk,
4320000	4323000	only the first 40 minutes of the show is usable.
4325000	4328000	Just like a role-playing event where you show up
4328000	4329000	and you get a card, but it says like,
4329000	4332000	oh, I'm the piano player, but you just...
4334000	4336000	Again, keep going.
4338000	4340000	We're going to support you all the way through this.
4340000	4343000	I don't know what my point is.
4344000	4346000	You know, I always want...
4346000	4349000	Erin, my ex-wife, we used to have...
4349000	4351000	She would have these theme birthday parties,
4351000	4354000	or parties like we would try to get everybody together
4354000	4356000	and try to create our own things or that,
4356000	4359000	or she actually ordered some online and stuff.
4359000	4361000	I would get really into those things.
4361000	4363000	There was one she did that was so complicated.
4363000	4365000	I still don't know what was happening.
4365000	4367000	You had to break up into groups, do a painting.
4367000	4369000	Remember that one where there was all sorts of...
4369000	4370000	Wasn't there a jail in that one?
4370000	4372000	You get sent to jail?
4373000	4375000	There was a...
4375000	4377000	Dan and Erin shot a video...
4377000	4379000	I just don't...
4379000	4382000	I'm telling you, this is not me talking trash.
4382000	4384000	I was paying attention.
4384000	4386000	I don't know what was going on at all.
4386000	4387000	And we were looking around like,
4387000	4388000	did anybody catch that?
4388000	4390000	Like, we were freaking out.
4390000	4393000	Oh, because you didn't catch what the rules were?
4393000	4397000	The gameplay was complicated as my recollection.
4397000	4398000	There was a lot happening.
4398000	4401000	There was arts and crafts, and I think of murder,
4401000	4404000	and people would go to Guantanamo Bay for a while.
4404000	4406000	Like, it was a lot happening.
4406000	4407000	It was a space station.
4407000	4409000	The party was a space station.
4409000	4413000	And you were notified a couple weeks in advance
4413000	4417000	what species of alien you represented.
4417000	4418000	So they were like...
4418000	4419000	That's not cool.
4419000	4420000	That was the cool part.
4420000	4421000	I like that.
4421000	4422000	There were people that were like,
4422000	4423000	oh, we're the garbage people.
4423000	4424000	And so they were like,
4424000	4428000	people made clothes out of garbage and blah, blah, blah.
4428000	4432000	We were one of several different species and all that stuff.
4432000	4435000	But, you know, there were extra rules and stuff and whatever.
4435000	4438000	We have our own problems, so let's not...
4438000	4440000	You know.
4440000	4442000	What's the best case scenario of proving
4442000	4446000	that Aaron McGathey's birthday party was shitty?
4446000	4447000	Are you asking me?
4447000	4448000	No, I know.
4448000	4449000	Okay.
4449000	4455000	I am not prepared to answer that.
4455000	4457000	There were too many rules.
4457000	4458000	Too many power crystals and things.
4458000	4459000	Oh, yeah.
4459000	4461000	There was marbles and crystals they had to find?
4461000	4462000	People were drunk.
4462000	4463000	And so they were just like,
4463000	4464000	what's going on?
4464000	4465000	I don't know.
4465000	4466000	And then you just wander.
4466000	4467000	I hid in the basement.
4467000	4468000	That was the prison.
4468000	4469000	Yeah.
4469000	4470000	But you hid?
4470000	4471000	Well, I mean, I wasn't hiding,
4471000	4472000	because if you did something wrong,
4472000	4473000	you had to go to the prison anyway.
4473000	4476000	So I just stayed in the prison.
4476000	4478000	I think the year before that,
4478000	4479000	there was the murder mystery,
4479000	4480000	the Tony's gangster thing.
4480000	4482000	And I got killed like right off the bat.
4482000	4483000	And so I just...
4483000	4486000	I died upstairs in a room that nobody came in
4486000	4488000	for like an hour and a half.
4488000	4489000	So I'm like,
4489000	4493000	I'm going to lay face down for as long as it takes.
4493000	4495000	And I was underneath the coffee table
4495000	4496000	in a way that there was no way
4496000	4497000	you could possibly land in there.
4497000	4500000	Like, I'm like...
4500000	4502000	You couldn't have landed like that.
4502000	4504000	Was it just to make a better picture?
4504000	4505000	Yeah, just to make it like...
4505000	4506000	People go,
4506000	4507000	Jesus, that guy died and it was complicated.
4507000	4508000	We don't know what happened.
4508000	4509000	But then I'm like,
4509000	4510000	okay, now I'm face down
4510000	4513000	and I'm in a pile of dog hair forever
4513000	4514000	for the rest of my life.
4514000	4516000	And then it became like a challenge.
4516000	4518000	Like, I'm not going to...
4518000	4521000	I'm going to stay here forever.
4521000	4523000	How long was it before people discovered you?
4523000	4525000	Maybe 40 minutes.
4525000	4526000	Oh, God.
4526000	4527000	That's too long.
4527000	4528000	It felt like an hour and a half.
4528000	4529000	So it's a murder mystery
4529000	4533000	where they don't discover the murder.
4533000	4534000	Well, people kept dying all over the place.
4534000	4535000	Like, I wasn't the only...
4535000	4536000	I think I was one of the people that died,
4536000	4538000	but I died right off the bat.
4538000	4539000	Somebody came up and handed me a card.
4539000	4540000	You're dead.
4540000	4541000	And you're not allowed to say anything.
4541000	4542000	You're just supposed to be dead on the spot.
4542000	4543000	Right.
4543000	4544000	So I was like, okay.
4544000	4545000	So I laid on the ground.
4545000	4547000	Then I realized nobody was looking for me.
4547000	4548000	I was up.
4548000	4551000	I was in the attic.
4551000	4554000	What were you doing up there?
4554000	4556000	I was supposed to go up there for some reason.
4556000	4557000	I was on a mission to go...
4557000	4558000	To get killed.
4558000	4559000	To talk to somebody or do a thing.
4559000	4563000	And it turns out I was on a mission for murder.
4563000	4565000	But I want to do a good one of the...
4565000	4567000	You know, like, that would be fun,
4567000	4569000	like doing, like, you know,
4569000	4570000	getting into it.
4570000	4571000	Absolutely. I love it.
4571000	4572000	I wanted to...
4572000	4573000	I was, like, walking around.
4573000	4577000	I was like, you need to get off my beeswax, mister.
4577000	4578000	Like, I was like...
4578000	4579000	I wanted to be a 20s guy.
4579000	4580000	All right.
4580000	4581000	Let's, uh...
4581000	4582000	Let's bring...
4589000	4597000	Guys, right now I am probably a quintillionaire on my...
4597000	4598000	On your lemonade stand?
4598000	4599000	My iPad.
4599000	4600000	So I don't care.
4600000	4602000	Do you want to try a little murder, mister?
4602000	4605000	Can we do one here, or does it take too much planning?
4605000	4606000	Oh, oh, oh.
4606000	4607000	How much planning could it take?
4607000	4610000	All right. Let's bring out towards Brown and...
4612000	4613000	All right.
4613000	4614000	What's that?
4614000	4615000	Yeah, you stay there.
4617000	4618000	Oh, yeah.
4621000	4622000	All right.
4623000	4624000	Okay. All right.
4624000	4626000	What's the quick way to do this?
4626000	4627000	Okay.
4628000	4629000	That's...
4629000	4631000	I think this is more Spencer's bailiwick than anybody's.
4631000	4632000	Like, he's...
4632000	4633000	Oh, Spencer's just going to reject the whole thing.
4633000	4634000	Oh, yeah. Big time.
4640000	4641000	It was going to...
4641000	4643000	That was going to go one or two ways.
4644000	4645000	I've already done a...
4645000	4646000	All right.
4648000	4649000	I'll tell...
4649000	4650000	I'm just going to try...
4650000	4654000	I'm going to improvise, like, the information you'd get on, like, a murder mystery night
4654000	4655000	card.
4655000	4656000	Okay.
4657000	4658000	Okay.
4667000	4668000	Demorj, how have you been?
4668000	4669000	I've been quite fine.
4669000	4670000	Thank you.
4670000	4673000	I, the last time I saw you, it was on dead authors, I think.
4673000	4674000	I think so.
4674000	4676000	Although I saw you in Bajillion Dollar Properties.
4676000	4677000	Oh, that's great.
4677000	4678000	That was a delight to see.
4678000	4679000	Bajillion Dollar Properties.
4680000	4681000	That's great.
4683000	4684000	How about you?
4684000	4685000	It's on CSO.
4686000	4689000	Paul F. Tompkins plays the patriarch of a...
4690000	4691000	of a realty company.
4691000	4693000	Oh, Demorj, you did one, right?
4693000	4694000	One or more?
4694000	4695000	Yeah, I'm the...
4695000	4696000	He's in the first one.
4696000	4697000	Yeah.
4697000	4698000	When they go to Adam Scott's house.
4698000	4699000	I'm the...
4699000	4700000	I did a bit on one, too.
4700000	4703000	I'm sad I didn't get to do it with either of you two.
4703000	4704000	Jerry Miner was on one.
4704000	4705000	All right.
4705000	4706000	Let me tell Demorj's character.
4706000	4707000	All right.
4707000	4708000	You talked to Spencer for a second.
4708000	4709000	Spencer!
4709000	4710000	How's it going?
4710000	4711000	Thanks for doing Harmon Quest, by the way.
4711000	4712000	What is it?
4712000	4713000	Absolutely. It was my pleasure.
4713000	4714000	I had a great time.
4714000	4715000	Did you see the finish part?
4715000	4716000	When did they start rolling those out?
4716000	4717000	Oh, you know.
4719000	4721000	We had an air date, and then they pushed it.
4721000	4722000	And so now I felt...
4722000	4724000	And then we didn't say that air date.
4724000	4727000	So now I feel even more loath to say the air date.
4727000	4730000	But it should be June something.
4731000	4732000	Of this year?
4732000	4734000	Of this year, unless it gets pushed again.
4734000	4735000	Yeah.
4735000	4737000	It was going to come out earlier, but then they rolled it out.
4737000	4739000	They were like, it's going to be the binge model.
4739000	4740000	I can't talk to you anymore.
4740000	4741000	It's fine.
4742000	4743000	So Demorj...
4743000	4744000	Demorj, you talked to Jeff.
4744000	4745000	Yes, sir.
4745000	4748000	Demorj, Arsenal, about eight, ten points back right now
4748000	4749000	in the British Premier League?
4749000	4750000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4750000	4754000	The big story that everybody's talking about except you guys
4755000	4759000	are that first place in England right now, the Leicester Foxes,
4759000	4762000	which is like the bad news bears winning the World Series.
4762000	4764000	They were the worst team last year.
4764000	4765000	And every week people have said,
4765000	4766000	one day these guys are going to lose
4766000	4767000	and there'll be an admirable cause.
4767000	4769000	But they look like a well-oiled machine.
4769000	4770000	They just keep going.
4770000	4771000	All right. That's enough soccer.
4771000	4772000	Yeah.
4772000	4774000	Paul, you and Demorj, why don't you guys catch up?
4775000	4778000	Well, we started to, and then we were interrupted.
4778000	4780000	We were interrupted by the host of the show.
4780000	4781000	Demorj, these elbow...
4781000	4783000	I want to talk about your elbow patches in the sweater.
4783000	4785000	What material are these elbow patches?
4785000	4787000	Because from here they look like carbon fiber.
4788000	4789000	Are they carbon fiber?
4789000	4790000	Precisely the point. They are.
4790000	4792000	They act as brake pads.
4793000	4794000	A lot of times I have to slide head first
4794000	4796000	into situations and fix shit.
4796000	4797000	And the only way to stop is...
4797000	4798000	These aren't elbow pads.
4798000	4801000	They're brake pads for a sex machine.
4801000	4802000	A good shout out to the people...
4805000	4806000	I got to thank the people from Bendix for these.
4806000	4807000	Bendix.
4807000	4808000	It's good.
4808000	4811000	And they are loaded with asbestos, so...
4811000	4812000	You're all going to get it.
4812000	4813000	You look like the guy that I would hire
4813000	4815000	if I needed to have somebody assassinated
4815000	4817000	aboard an old whaling vessel.
4822000	4823000	Just enough people working.
4823000	4825000	You wouldn't get to know everyone.
4828000	4830000	There would be some strangers on the whaling.
4830000	4831000	We have to leave shadows.
4831000	4833000	Yeah, it's a big whaling vessel.
4833000	4835000	There would be maybe 200, 300 people
4835000	4837000	aboard those larger ships.
4837000	4838000	I read Moby Dick.
4840000	4841000	Did you ever read Moby Dick, Paul?
4841000	4843000	I've not read Moby Dick, but I read
4843000	4846000	In the Heart of the Sea, the book that was
4846000	4850000	about the trip that inspired Moby Dick.
4850000	4852000	Much better book than a movie.
4853000	4854000	If you saw that.
4855000	4857000	Oh, shit.
4861000	4862000	Oh, oh, my word.
4863000	4865000	The storm is giving me such a fright.
4868000	4871000	I say the weather is a bit dreeked right now, isn't it?
4872000	4873000	A bit water?
4873000	4874000	Dreeked?
4874000	4875000	It's Scottish, you know.
4875000	4876000	I'm not Scottish.
4876000	4877000	I'm English.
4877000	4879000	But I've been all over the United Kingdom.
4881000	4882000	Hey, come on, you guys.
4882000	4883000	This weather's a bit rough.
4885000	4886000	Is it?
4886000	4887000	I'm sorry.
4887000	4888000	Was I going on?
4889000	4890000	Well, isn't that your way?
4891000	4893000	Sneak into a room and take anything you want.
4893000	4895000	Oh, now, wow, fucker.
4895000	4896000	You.
4898000	4901000	I haven't had the pleasure of your acquaintance, sir.
4901000	4905000	It seems a bit warm language for a new acquaintance.
4905000	4906000	It's fine.
4906000	4907000	Excuse me.
4907000	4909000	Sorry, I didn't expect things to...
4909000	4910000	Oh, I didn't see you, Daddy.
4910000	4912000	Well, now, who is this gentleman?
4914000	4917000	I am the butler, Mr. Hosterson.
4918000	4926000	Mr. Hosterson, I object to the language I was being treated with by this gentleman over here.
4927000	4937000	Now, now, you all have complicated backstories that overlap with each other in intricate ways.
4938000	4941000	Yes, for instance, I'm an explorer.
4941000	4948000	You can see how that weaves into your complex stories.
4950000	4953000	An explorer that we should never know to talk about.
4954000	4955000	I should say.
4955000	4962000	You should all be thanked for coming here through such terrible weather.
4963000	4967000	This being the front room of the antechamber.
4968000	4971000	There are six antechambers, each with a front room.
4971000	4978000	But let's skip all that and please come into the drawing room.
4978000	4980000	Oh, what a lovely drawing room.
4980000	4983000	I'll take your coats, starting with you, sir.
4983000	4986000	Not starting with a lady, the very idea.
4988000	4991000	Oh, Mr. Hosterson, start with a lady.
4991000	4996000	I'm very glad that there's a man between you and that animal rascal bastard.
4998000	5002000	All of this masculine energy that's given me the vapors.
5004000	5006000	I am quite sorry, madam.
5006000	5007000	I'll take your coat.
5007000	5009000	I don't believe we've been introduced.
5009000	5011000	My name is Madame Beauregard.
5011000	5014000	I am a lady of the south.
5015000	5018000	Well, that's a very well-developed character.
5018000	5019000	Thank you.
5020000	5021000	Thank you.
5022000	5025000	You know my gender and a region I come from.
5026000	5029000	You know, but done on the fly.
5029000	5032000	I mean, that's, wait, I'm British.
5032000	5033000	Are you?
5038000	5040000	And your coat, sir?
5040000	5042000	Yes, be very careful with this.
5042000	5043000	It's green felt.
5043000	5046000	Oh, why is that?
5046000	5051000	Well, I give you one when you reach a certain level of the academic institution that I've come from.
5051000	5057000	If you wanted to get into the faculty room and get the mustard sandwiches all by yourself with coats, it cut the crust off the sandwich.
5059000	5060000	I see.
5060000	5062000	What is all this rigmarole?
5062000	5064000	What is this character, even?
5064000	5067000	You sound to be a man of academia.
5067000	5068000	I am.
5068000	5074000	I focus on economics and Schumpeter specifically until I became a single man.
5074000	5079000	And then I focused on specifically the economics of the bachelor.
5082000	5086000	I think that's the plot of community.
5089000	5090000	I should say...
5090000	5091000	What's your name?
5091000	5092000	Buttmunch.
5094000	5096000	Professor Buttmunch.
5096000	5101000	If I may, Professor, what are the economics of the bachelor?
5101000	5108000	Is it things like eating the peanut butter directly out of the jar so as to save money on washing dishes?
5108000	5110000	It goes further than that.
5110000	5116000	You have to understand if the peanut butter is crunchy, directly out of the jar simply will not do.
5116000	5118000	Oh, I forgot.
5118000	5121000	I should get the door.
5121000	5124000	Marissa, I forgot there should be a murder victim.
5124000	5126000	Marissa, come here.
5126000	5128000	Sit in the chair there.
5128000	5130000	Mind you.
5130000	5136000	This is Lady Florentine of the Florence.
5137000	5140000	If you want to say anything, you'll get killed in a minute.
5140000	5144000	Thanks for having me. Good to be here.
5145000	5147000	And your coat, sir. Thank you.
5147000	5151000	I think I'm Colonel Assmaster.
5153000	5160000	These names are very, very imaginative for someone coming up with them right on the fly like this.
5160000	5163000	Very colorful, I will agree.
5163000	5165000	And you, sir?
5165000	5168000	The name is Spoonerson.
5168000	5173000	Sounds like someone got tired of making up names.
5173000	5177000	As they went from one side of the stage to the other.
5177000	5183000	Got so caught up making up the name that they just threw in your occupation at the end, which was...
5183000	5184000	Explorer.
5184000	5186000	Right.
5186000	5190000	Oh, God, the lights went out! Turn off the lights!
5190000	5192000	Why, it's so dark! What's happening?
5192000	5198000	The lights are still on! The lights are still on!
5198000	5200000	I can see everything that's happening.
5200000	5202000	Oh, she can't turn off.
5202000	5203000	Really?
5203000	5206000	It's not happening.
5206000	5208000	Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
5208000	5212000	Most of the lights have gone out!
5212000	5214000	I can still kind of see everything.
5214000	5218000	The lights are gradually going out!
5218000	5221000	I am growing ever more terrified!
5221000	5224000	Everybody just close your eyes! Everyone close your eyes!
5224000	5225000	Oh!
5225000	5232000	Except for that one camera phone the lights have gone out!
5232000	5236000	I can tell you as a bachelor, sometimes your lights go out when you least expect it.
5236000	5239000	You thought you paid a bill and you skipped the month.
5239000	5241000	More of these bachelor's come.
5241000	5243000	Clump, clump, clump, clump, clump, clump, clump!
5244000	5246000	Argh!
5252000	5256000	Lights! Lights! I found the circuit breaker! I found it!
5256000	5258000	There's been a murder!
5258000	5263000	You know what? I think I know who did it, a horse riding a motorcycle!
5265000	5271000	Hold on one second. There was a chainsaw in there, too, so they may well have been in a car.
5271000	5275000	Oh, it's a chainsaw! I do apologize.
5275000	5277000	I'm unaccustomed to such machines!
5277000	5279000	Yeah, when my travels are here.
5279000	5286000	Ooh! Ooh! The body seems to have horse prints and gunshot and chainsaw marks all over her.
5286000	5289000	I say, what a dreadful thing!
5289000	5296000	Of course the vocabulary is held up by the storm, so we'll have to stay here until they show up.
5296000	5299000	How did that horse get away in that motorcycle if the storm was so bad?
5299000	5305000	Well, I would hazard a guess that it was a Lipizaner Stallions among the smartest next to the Arabians.
5305000	5308000	Not only can they hold a man, but they can ride a chainsaw.
5308000	5310000	Very sensible.
5310000	5315000	Why would the storm be holding up the police or they ain't squad cars made of sugar, sir?
5320000	5321000	Ooh!
5321000	5324000	Ma'am, I would suggest you take a look at a movie called The Shining.
5325000	5326000	Um...
5326000	5328000	Well, one thing's for certain.
5328000	5330000	The murderer...
5330000	5332000	isn't a stereo.
5332000	5333000	Oh!
5333000	5335000	Oh! There's such good news!
5335000	5337000	Scotland Yard is here.
5337000	5339000	Detective Steve Levy is here.
5339000	5341000	How did he get us in the storm?
5341000	5344000	He was here already patrolling the barn.
5344000	5346000	What?
5346000	5348000	Detective Steve Levy!
5348000	5349000	Oh!
5351000	5353000	It's special!
5354000	5359000	Detective, I can tell by your stance and posture you are a lonely man.
5361000	5363000	Goddamn.
5364000	5365000	It's all under degree.
5365000	5366000	It's pretty good.
5366000	5369000	Inspector, I beg of you to solve this murder quickly.
5369000	5372000	This puts me in mind that when my own dear husband was murdered...
5372000	5376000	You say that you already have a murdered spouse?
5376000	5379000	Well, that casts a delight of suspicion on you right away.
5379000	5383000	What one murdered spouse does not a murderous make, sir?
5384000	5386000	What is this, the staircase?
5388000	5391000	My husband was murdered by an owl.
5394000	5396000	Under what circumstances?
5396000	5399000	He was at the top of the stairs arguing with an owl.
5399000	5401000	Things got heated.
5405000	5407000	Well, this is an act of...
5407000	5409000	That sounds like a real whoo!
5409000	5411000	Hey!
5415000	5417000	Thank you.
5417000	5419000	This is an act of crime scene.
5419000	5421000	I think everyone should clear out.
5421000	5426000	We'll put around the yellow police tape and draw the outline of the body.
5426000	5427000	Oh my goodness, sir.
5427000	5429000	We'll bring in the crew, clean up.
5429000	5431000	We're dealing with dignified company hair.
5431000	5434000	So do you need us to leave the room while you do all this?
5434000	5438000	Well, maybe you should stay and help me?
5438000	5441000	Now, this seems highly irregular.
5442000	5450000	That the suspects in the murder investigation have to do the busy work of sealing the crime scene.
5450000	5454000	It seems counted to your purposes if you don't mind my saying so.
5454000	5457000	I am just a woman from the south.
5457000	5466000	Well, one thing is for certain, sir.
5466000	5469000	If it would be all right with the constabulary,
5469000	5475000	I believe the deceased corpse should be removed from the antechamber into the...
5475000	5478000	Oh, I wasn't saying that you had to sit down.
5478000	5480000	For a moment, that's all.
5480000	5484000	Yeah, Merissa. Merissa has the corpse, everybody.
5488000	5495000	It will take two people who will split off into a different scene
5495000	5502000	to move her body into the icebox.
5502000	5506000	Well, this is a grisly affair.
5506000	5512000	Seeing as how I'm a soldier, accustomed to being around bloody scenes before,
5512000	5514000	I'll lend a hand, I suppose.
5514000	5516000	Do we have another volunteer?
5516000	5518000	Are we all British now?
5518000	5524000	If possible, I might be willing to volunteer to assist this rascallion.
5524000	5526000	What say you?
5526000	5528000	Shall we?
5528000	5531000	I don't see any reason for you to have such anger towards me, sir.
5531000	5532000	Well...
5532000	5534000	But the deed must be done, so let's...
5534000	5540000	Evo, lend a hand, clap to that slab line and hoist away on the missing...
5540000	5542000	Shall we check with the police?
5542000	5545000	Yes, this is highly suspicious.
5546000	5547000	Well, is it...
5547000	5548000	This is a crime scene.
5548000	5549000	Wasn't it you that deserved it?
5549000	5551000	We need to investigate.
5551000	5552000	Well, I didn't...
5552000	5554000	Mr. Hostess, there's an occurrence...
5554000	5557000	Very wisely said we should put the body into the icebox.
5557000	5560000	I mean, that's suspicious.
5560000	5561000	This is a very...
5561000	5564000	Yes, Mr. Hostess, and why should we move the body away from the crime scene?
5564000	5567000	And why the icebox? I mean, you're done with the...
5567000	5570000	And whose house is this?
5570000	5573000	And why are we all here, for pity's sake?
5573000	5576000	We never... That was never really made clear in the invitation
5576000	5579000	why these four different people were asked to your home.
5579000	5582000	You just received a mysterious invitation.
5582000	5583000	That is correct.
5583000	5586000	Come to this mansion, you won't regret it.
5587000	5592000	Well, it won't satisfy you further to know that I received a similar invitation
5592000	5595000	which simply added, Be the butler.
5595000	5604000	Sir, do you mean to say you are not a proper butler?
5604000	5605000	Oh, my word.
5605000	5608000	Take much umbrage at your tongue wagging.
5608000	5609000	I do...
5609000	5616000	I'll forgive you as you are a colonist, but I am from three generations of manservants.
5616000	5617000	Sergeant Levy.
5617000	5619000	Sergeant Levy, if I may pull you aside for a moment.
5619000	5620000	Sergeant Levy.
5620000	5621000	Yes.
5621000	5622000	If I may pull you aside for a moment.
5622000	5624000	It seems to me that the main suspect here must be the host of this party
5624000	5625000	that's never shown himself.
5625000	5630000	Invited to a strange room, that of strangers, by murder.
5630000	5632000	Who is this host that sent out these invitations?
5632000	5634000	I think he is your suspect.
5635000	5637000	Yeah, well...
5638000	5640000	You're accusatory.
5640000	5642000	I don't know anything about anyone here.
5642000	5644000	I just arrived, there's a body.
5647000	5648000	If I may.
5648000	5649000	This is insane.
5649000	5650000	If I may.
5651000	5653000	You're all a bunch of characters.
5653000	5655000	You seem to be a terrible...
5655000	5657000	Well-developed characters, I would say.
5657000	5659000	Very well-developed.
5659000	5662000	Maybe you heard my husband got murdered some time ago.
5663000	5665000	By an owl, she says.
5665000	5667000	An owl, indeed.
5668000	5669000	Well, I'll tell you one thing.
5669000	5677000	My wife disappeared in much the same manner as a death by the hands of a man.
5677000	5681000	A man took her away with wily wiles.
5683000	5686000	We left a scent in my house that could only be described as cologne.
5686000	5688000	I know it because I wear it as such to try to procure another lady.
5688000	5690000	Are you accusing me of something?
5690000	5692000	If you have an accusation to make, sir, I...
5692000	5694000	I've never smelled that scent before.
5694000	5696000	Until tonight.
5696000	5697000	What?
5697000	5698000	From that side of the room.
5698000	5701000	Yes, it's true, I did run away with her wife, but I was not responsible for her disappearance.
5701000	5704000	She left tonight as... I was as much shocked as anybody.
5708000	5710000	She hates horses.
5710000	5712000	Well, I suppose...
5714000	5719000	Not having done any of these, that it's time to pick who's the killer?
5719000	5721000	You know, no...
5721000	5723000	Mr. Holsterson!
5723000	5725000	Mr. Holsterson, if I may.
5726000	5729000	Is this one of these situations where...
5731000	5733000	Mr. Holsterson, if I may.
5733000	5734000	I...
5734000	5737000	There's someone who's been conspicuously silent during all this...
5737000	5739000	I agree, yes.
5739000	5740000	I agree.
5740000	5741000	This straight explore fellow.
5741000	5742000	This explore.
5742000	5747000	Sir, first of all, I will forgive you not removing your pith helmet in the presence of a lady.
5748000	5750000	But why are you so strangely silent, sir?
5750000	5751000	There has been a murder.
5751000	5753000	Because there's two things I know.
5753000	5756000	One thing is that I'm an explorer.
5756000	5759000	And two things are that...
5759000	5763000	Assmaster embezzled buttmunch at some point.
5763000	5764000	It's a plot point.
5764000	5771000	And that might be relevant to this whole scenario we found ourselves in, because otherwise, why would I know that?
5772000	5774000	My goodness!
5774000	5778000	What a cat's cradle of well-crafted characters!
5778000	5786000	It's as if some master storyteller of the top of his head wove a spider's web of delight!
5786000	5787000	Indeed.
5787000	5789000	Let me ask you a question of these two gentlemen.
5789000	5791000	Did you know the deceased lady?
5791000	5793000	Mrs. Florentine?
5793000	5795000	Of course we all knew Mrs. Florentine.
5795000	5797000	She was the biggest...
5798000	5802000	The biggest socialite in Essex Gardens!
5802000	5805000	She was the lady of the Florentine Gardens.
5805000	5807000	Not the same lady, Florentine.
5807000	5808000	The lady Florentine.
5808000	5811000	Oh, my word, I had no idea I was in the presence of a celebrity.
5811000	5814000	You pretend to not know who Lady Florentine is.
5814000	5815000	Well, I...
5815000	5817000	Perhaps it's Southern modesty.
5817000	5819000	I found a trapdoor!
5823000	5824000	My word!
5828000	5830000	Let's all go down!
5833000	5835000	My goodness!
5835000	5837000	The murder weapon this must be!
5837000	5839000	It's covered in blood and horse hair!
5842000	5844000	It's a standard issue horse knife!
5846000	5850000	A very wide handle to attach to a horseshoe.
5852000	5856000	But only one person can lift this much weight.
5857000	5862000	Well, that...
5862000	5864000	Hostison.
5865000	5867000	Of the family hosta.
5868000	5870000	Son of host.
5871000	5874000	Gilded craftsman in the art of hospitality.
5876000	5879000	Is it not true that you are a domestic sherpa,
5879000	5883000	and that you must be skilled in the carrying of all things,
5883000	5886000	domestic and otherwise, in a household should something happen,
5886000	5888000	an atomic problem?
5888000	5891000	And is it also true that you would be the only one in this house
5891000	5893000	that has access to the horse stables?
5893000	5897000	Well, you are true after a fashion, my friends.
5897000	5899000	However...
5901000	5903000	He's peeling his own feet off!
5903000	5904000	Oh, shit!
5904000	5906000	This is disgusting!
5906000	5910000	What you don't know is I have a horrible skin disease.
5910000	5917000	And keep peeling layers of my face off!
5917000	5920000	Are you the actual master of this home?
5920000	5923000	No, I'm just horribly deformed.
5925000	5926000	Put it back on!
5926000	5928000	That doesn't mean you can't lift the weapon.
5928000	5931000	I can't put it back on, that's so offensive.
5931000	5933000	He's just peeling his own skin off like that,
5933000	5935000	seeing from poltergeist!
5935000	5938000	Well, what would you have me do, live in pain?
5938000	5940000	Don't do that, don't do it!
5940000	5942000	It's unpleasant, sir, unpleasant.
5942000	5945000	I would expect nothing less of all of you.
5945000	5947000	What?!
5947000	5949000	Another face peel off?!
5949000	5951000	Ricardo Montalban.
5951000	5953000	That's right.
5953000	5956000	It's my house, and I invited all of you here,
5956000	5960000	because, well, each of you should know why.
5960000	5964000	One way or another, you've all done something wrong to me, I think.
5964000	5969000	Colonel Assmaster.
5969000	5970000	Yes?
5970000	5973000	You've done a lot of wrong things to a lot of people.
5973000	5978000	Did you not once tell me that you would rather see me dead?
5978000	5982000	And, oh, this is falling apart.
5982000	5984000	Oh, just now?
5988000	5989000	Yes!
5989000	5992000	Yes!
5992000	5995000	Yes, after a few glasses of port wine, I did say as much,
5995000	5998000	because you and Lady Florentine have been cheating around behind my back.
5998000	6001000	It's quite well known that I had been dating Lady Florentine behind my wife's back
6001000	6003000	for many, many months.
6003000	6006000	I found another trap door.
6006000	6009000	But only I'm going down it.
6009000	6012000	Look at him go!
6012000	6015000	He's clearly the murderer, right?
6015000	6017000	I think he is.
6017000	6020000	Not necessarily.
6023000	6027000	Secret tunnels, miles of them.
6027000	6031000	Must be some kind of destination.
6031000	6037000	Well, gentlemen, I feel like we've learned a valuable lesson here tonight.
6037000	6040000	Some bachelors eat peanut butter straight out of the can.
6040000	6043000	Others build tunnels and riddles.
6043000	6047000	Nobody chased me.
6047000	6050000	I mean, it seemed like someone's obvious job to chase you,
6050000	6053000	but I don't want to point any fingers.
6053000	6054000	Everyone!
6054000	6055000	Everyone, look!
6055000	6056000	Look!
6056000	6058000	Sergeant Levy's been killed!
6058000	6060000	Oh, that's why!
6060000	6061000	Well, that distraction was happening.
6061000	6064000	Sergeant Levy's laying dead in the floor with a letter opener
6064000	6067000	stabbed in the back of his face.
6067000	6069000	I wonder.
6069000	6072000	Killed in the back of his face?
6072000	6074000	There's no light down here.
6074000	6076000	I can't...
6076000	6079000	I ran for miles, and I can't...
6079000	6081000	I guess I could go back the other way,
6081000	6083000	but I've turned around so many times,
6083000	6086000	I can't tell which way I'm going now.
6086000	6090000	I'll walk this way for 20 seconds,
6090000	6093000	and if I don't encounter anything,
6093000	6095000	I'll put a mark in the floor,
6095000	6098000	like a divot that I can feel.
6103000	6105000	Did you hear those murders?
6105000	6107000	Five years later...
6113000	6118000	Happy birthday to you, well, professor,
6118000	6123000	I can't believe it's our fifth year here in this mansion.
6123000	6127000	Still, look, the murders have gone unsolved.
6127000	6129000	I think we know who did them.
6129000	6132000	It seems like it's an open and shut case.
6132000	6135000	My family must be worried about me at this point.
6135000	6137000	In a way, though, Colonel,
6137000	6141000	I feel as if we've become our own little family in this mansion.
6141000	6144000	Say hi to my wife if you happen to leave.
6144000	6146000	I found...
6146000	6148000	Oh, snap!
6148000	6152000	That sounded like a burn, but I'm not sure who got burned.
6152000	6156000	Say hi to my wife if you happen to leave.
6156000	6159000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6159000	6162000	Oh, yeah, that's what my mom said.
6162000	6165000	I will? Okay, yeah, sure thing.
6165000	6167000	I can hear seagulls.
6167000	6170000	I'm going to make my way towards the sound.
6170000	6174000	Hopefully this will be my last diary entry.
6176000	6180000	Hopefully because I've published these tomes.
6180000	6182000	Oh!
6186000	6188000	Here we go.
6195000	6198000	A rocky shore.
6198000	6202000	Has it been so long since I've seen the light?
6203000	6207000	This elaborate labyrinth of caverns and passages
6207000	6212000	must have gone all the way under the natural limestone of Murder Island.
6214000	6216000	But why terminate here?
6216000	6219000	Why put a door at the sheer cliff?
6225000	6228000	The sound mocks me.
6228000	6232000	I did a bad job hosting that murder mystery.
6238000	6242000	The jagged rocks invite me to my recompense.
6242000	6245000	It's what I deserve.
6245000	6249000	Out in the distance, you see a sailboat, and it's Colonel Nastemaster,
6249000	6252000	and he's aboard his own vessel, and he's waving him a goodbye, everybody!
6252000	6254000	Five years and a good time!
6254000	6256000	Goodbye, goodbye!
6256000	6258000	I'm going back to Old Blighty!
6258000	6261000	Hoist the bangs and the stencils,
6261000	6264000	and fiddle-beat the bowels.
6267000	6270000	I think I've come to terms with the loss of my wife now.
6270000	6273000	So many years to meditate on it.
6273000	6275000	I feel much the same, Professor.
6275000	6277000	I feel as if I'm finally ready to move on.
6277000	6280000	As the boat turns and heaves too towards the wind,
6280000	6284000	you see the stern of the boat come into view,
6284000	6287000	and it says, H.M.S., I did it.
6290000	6293000	So, As-Master was the murderer.
6294000	6297000	As for my death,
6297000	6300000	none will question its cause.
6300000	6305000	Its murderer was lack of preparation.
6310000	6314000	Camera pans up, and you see seagulls fly into the sky.
6314000	6317000	Did I turn into one of them?
6317000	6320000	Or was it just a ratings board thing?
6321000	6324000	We don't know.
6324000	6329000	That was a really good murder mystery night.
6332000	6334000	You guys did a pretty good job.
6334000	6337000	I think that was a solid effort.
6337000	6341000	Now, imagine what we could do with a couple hours of preparation.
6341000	6342000	Oh, yeah.
6342000	6345000	But I think definitely someone should transcribe that.
6345000	6349000	And I think with a few tweaks, we've got a pretty good script.
6350000	6353000	I knew that you're supposed to tell some people
6353000	6355000	that there's something about someone else,
6355000	6359000	but I think I didn't realize it's supposed to all lead back to...
6359000	6363000	You just told me your name is Colonel As-Master, and you did it.
6366000	6368000	That's all I got.
6369000	6372000	And then I said, you're Professor Butt-Munch,
6372000	6374000	and he stole your wife.
6374000	6376000	And then I said, you're a Southern Belle.
6376000	6378000	And my husband was murdered.
6379000	6381000	Separate thing.
6381000	6383000	And I said, you're the butler.
6383000	6389000	No way. Your name is Sp-Sp-Sp-Sp-Sp-Sp-Sp-Sp-Sp-Sp-Spoonerman.
6389000	6391000	And I said, you're the butler.
6391000	6393000	No way. You're the explorer.
6393000	6396000	Right. Because I realized I should be the butler.
6396000	6397000	And then you walked over there.
6397000	6399000	That thing would have been a mess without a host.
6399000	6401000	Yeah.
6401000	6403000	And then Levy, I didn't tell anything.
6403000	6407000	What? You gave me the most complicated of all of those.
6407000	6409000	Well, I told you after a while.
6409000	6411000	I said, yeah, you were dating Beauregard,
6411000	6413000	and that you guys wanted a ride.
6413000	6414000	Yeah. And you weren't even in on it.
6414000	6416000	I was like, what the fuck's going on?
6416000	6417000	Not at all. Not at all.
6417000	6419000	And not only that, the plot thickens.
6419000	6421000	We're trying to rob the house.
6421000	6422000	Oh, yeah.
6422000	6424000	I should have told you. I should have told you.
6424000	6426000	Should have told him.
6428000	6430000	I should have told you that.
6430000	6433000	That was a real dead end for me.
6434000	6437000	It wasn't the perfect crime.
6437000	6440000	All right. Well, but...
6440000	6443000	Like you say, that was just you freestyling, man.
6443000	6448000	That was the equivalent of your freestyle raps.
6448000	6450000	Yeah.
6450000	6452000	Yeah. You're saying it's time to end the show.
6452000	6454000	And what have we learned?
6454000	6457000	What have we learned tonight?
6457000	6460000	We learned that Paul's married.
6460000	6461000	It's true.
6461000	6463000	He doesn't have kids.
6463000	6467000	That he has a show on CISO called Pajillion Dollar...
6467000	6470000	I was going to say Pajillion Dollar Mysteries.
6470000	6471000	Oh!
6471000	6474000	I like that spin-off idea, though.
6474000	6475000	Created by Kulop.
6475000	6477000	That's right. Kulop Vilisak.
6477000	6479000	Good job saying her last name.
6479000	6481000	I wasn't going to touch it.
6481000	6483000	Vilisak.
6483000	6485000	Vilisak.
6485000	6486000	All right.
6486000	6488000	Next time I'll say it just like I'm saying Johnson.
6488000	6490000	Our friend Kulop created it.
6490000	6494000	It is supposedly pretty good.
6494000	6497000	I'm biased, but I think it's very funny.
6497000	6501000	It's like an homage to the treasure chest
6501000	6504000	that is these unscripted realtor shows,
6504000	6507000	which are all insane. I've seen some of them.
6507000	6508000	They are all insane.
6508000	6510000	They're filled with monstrous people.
6510000	6512000	And your character's name is...
6512000	6516000	Dean Rose Dragon.
6516000	6518000	It's like the patriarch of the realtor.
6519000	6523000	We learned that Demorge really took it to heart
6523000	6527000	when we said that turtleneck was sexy last time.
6527000	6529000	Because I wore it twice.
6529000	6532000	Sorry. That's bullying. I'm bullying.
6532000	6539000	We learned that Steve has to do everything I say.
6542000	6544000	We learned that Spencer's...
6544000	6546000	I'm going to explore.
6548000	6550000	Jeff still loves clothes.
6550000	6553000	I still love clothes.
6553000	6555000	Still do.
6555000	6557000	There's some days when I go,
6557000	6559000	oh, you know what? Fuck clothes.
6559000	6561000	But I come back at the end of the day, I'm like,
6561000	6563000	fuck, I can't quit you clothes.
6563000	6566000	But this is a weekly check-in, right?
6566000	6570000	We learned that the mics are on a hair trigger,
6570000	6573000	but the lights are locked down.
6573000	6576000	Locked in place.
6576000	6578000	You have to go to a cabinet, get a key,
6578000	6580000	slay a three-headed dog.
6580000	6583000	Two guys have to turn the keys at the same time.
6583000	6585000	I said turn the switch.
6585000	6588000	That's the cold open of the Matthew Bratterick
6588000	6591000	lights-gone-mad movie from the 80s.
6591000	6594000	But most of all, we learned to love.
6597000	6599000	It's sexual.
6601000	6603000	It is sexual.
6603000	6605000	Sexual.
6607000	6609000	I was surprised to learn that Spencer
6609000	6612000	automatically against murder mystery role-playing.
6612000	6616000	I have a thing against games where the idea is,
6616000	6619000	let's come up with it right now.
6623000	6626000	And that's, you know, that's just experience.
6626000	6629000	Yeah, that's very fair. It's quite fair.
6632000	6635000	So I guess, Dan, Paul, you've never been on the show before.
6635000	6638000	This is the part where our guest, Paul,
6638000	6639000	sings a little ballad for us.
6639000	6641000	Sure. Absolutely.
6646000	6648000	And I'll be happy to do your...
6648000	6650000	I'll be happy to do the...
6650000	6651000	I'm trying to pick music.
6651000	6653000	The rapper that comes in on the bridge.
6653000	6655000	Oh, great.
6655000	6657000	Featuring Dan Harmon.
6657000	6660000	The guy that's been assigned by the label.
6660000	6661000	That's right.
6661000	6663000	To help bring up your first single.
6663000	6665000	I don't know, because this is brand new.
6665000	6667000	Jordan gave me this one, too. Let me see if this one will work.
6669000	6670000	Nope.
6670000	6672000	Oh, I love this ballad.
6675000	6677000	All right, let's try...
6680000	6681000	How long is that one?
6681000	6682000	Nasty short.
6682000	6684000	You guys do his thing.
6693000	6704000	How do you tell someone it's time to say goodbye?
6704000	6705000	Yo.
6705000	6711000	How do you tell someone that it's time to fly up into the sky?
6711000	6713000	Can you feel it?
6717000	6719000	You're just doing a little timing.
6719000	6720000	Yeah, yeah.
6720000	6722000	It's like, this is that version.
6722000	6726000	Am I listening to the Pussycat Dolls song where his stoop's coming in eventually?
6726000	6728000	And he lets you know at the top. He's like, yo.
6728000	6729000	And you're like, okay.
6729000	6731000	Okay, but there will be a breakdown.
6731000	6732000	Yeah, of course.
6732000	6733000	Of course.
6733000	6734000	All right, okay.
6737000	6742000	How do you tell someone that it's time to say goodbye?
6742000	6743000	Yo.
6743000	6744000	That was good.
6745000	6746000	I thought you were taking over.
6746000	6748000	I was just taking over.
6749000	6750000	Take, take.
6776000	6777000	Take it down.
6777000	6779000	Take the penny in for a pound.
6779000	6783000	I saw your mama outside at the ground round.
6783000	6786000	But she said, let's go to the pet store.
6786000	6789000	She said, I won't want to pay for dogs no more.
6789000	6791000	But I said, oh, no.
6791000	6793000	You got a big dollar.
6793000	6796000	If you're going to take a dog on a leash and a collar,
6796000	6799000	I'm going to say the same thing.
6799000	6801000	I'm here with P.F.G.
6801000	6803000	And he's doing a thing.
6803000	6806000	I'm at the pet store.
6806000	6810000	I fell in love with you at the stolen pet store.
6810000	6812000	Pet store.
6812000	6816000	What a confusing name for a pet store.
6818000	6821000	Yeah, you can't front all men.
6824000	6825000	Still going?
6825000	6826000	Second verse.
6833000	6834000	Yo.
6835000	6836000	P.F.T.
6836000	6837000	Yo.
6842000	6844000	Never wanted to fuck you.
6851000	6852000	Yo.
6864000	6865000	Two times two.
6865000	6866000	Two to the four.
6866000	6867000	I put four.
6867000	6868000	I guess four.
6868000	6870000	And I got eight more.
6870000	6871000	I'm bad at math.
6871000	6873000	But that don't mean I'm good at reading.
6873000	6875000	Gotta fucking do the thing.
6875000	6877000	It's cutting and bleeding.
6877000	6880000	I'm on the sidewalk and on the street.
6880000	6884000	I put your mama's face in her hat and grabbed her feet.
6884000	6887000	And I swung her round like she was her shot put.
6887000	6893000	Gonna put your mama so low, she gonna get shot.
6895000	6896000	Shut.
6896000	6897000	Shut.
6897000	6898000	Shut.
6898000	6900000	Pet store murderer.
6900000	6901000	Why are you acting?
6901000	6903000	Pet store murderer.
6903000	6905000	Why do you even attack me?
6905000	6906000	Pet store murderer.
6906000	6908000	Why are you acting?
6908000	6910000	Pet store murderer.
6910000	6912000	I'm in love.
6914000	6915000	Shit.
6915000	6916000	It's bad.
6916000	6917000	Yeah.
6917000	6918000	It's bad.
6918000	6920000	Thank you for coming to Hyman Channel everybody.
6920000	6922000	Let's hear it for Steve Levy.
6923000	6925000	Demorge Brown.
6925000	6928000	Spencer Crittenden.
6928000	6929000	I'm Jeff Davis.
6929000	6932000	Your man Dan Harmon everybody.
6932000	6934000	Paul F. Tompkins.
6937000	6938000	Oh yeah.
6943000	6945000	That's how you do it.
6947000	6948000	Thank you for coming.
6948000	6950000	Drive fast and take chances everyone.
6951000	6952000	Did you get any of that?
6953000	6955000	It's a good show.
