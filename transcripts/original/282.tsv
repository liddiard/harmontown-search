0	14160	Spencer, do you hear what I hear?
14160	17120	No.
17120	20560	Whoa, they're rude.
20560	23280	I'm gassed on the missing mast.
23280	28420	Spencer, I think it's the beginning of spring, but I think I hear sleigh bells and the pitter
28420	29860	pat of reindeer ho.
29860	30860	Oh, oh, oh.
30860	31860	In March slash April?
31860	32860	Yes.
32860	34580	Mmm, slow down reindeer.
34580	38860	Santa Claus, I just came up through the chimney because I heard you.
38860	40860	Jesus Christ!
40860	42260	What the shit?
42260	43860	I'm supposed to go down that.
43860	44860	And I'm behind you.
44860	45860	I can say...
45860	46860	God damn it!
46860	47860	I can say the same thing to you.
47860	50700	What the fuck are you doing on my roof today?
50700	51700	It's almost April.
51700	55100	Are you Jeffy Davis?
55100	57300	Jeff B. Davis, but close enough.
57740	60300	Well, you're on my nice list.
60300	61300	What?
61300	63140	Plus one.
63140	64140	Is that Spencer?
64140	67780	Spencer L. Crittenden.
67780	70660	He can be your plus one because...
70660	71660	Why...
71660	74420	Look, can I get out front of the sp... Santa Claus?
74420	76420	Well, that would embarrass me.
76420	77420	Well, look...
77420	81300	Can you let me take it at least across the threshold so I don't look like an invalid?
81300	82300	All right.
82300	87260	Look, Santa Claus, I enjoyed your choo-choo and your Legos, so you'd fucking say that.
87260	88260	No!
88260	90340	I'll tell you what, though.
90340	91340	And you can...
91340	95660	After I initiate it, you can come in any time you want.
95660	99540	I've come back around to my nicest boys.
99540	100540	With me undies!
100540	101540	Wait!
101540	107980	Are you just here doing a cheesy podcast advert?
107980	116620	It's Harmon Town's first historic, and I believe the podcast industry's first live pre-roll
116620	117620	adries.
117620	119540	Some people said this was a bad idea.
119540	124620	No, by the way, this wasn't the client's idea, unless they...
124620	125620	This was my idea as an entertainer!
125620	126620	I thought it'd be cool!
126620	134620	Okay, well, look, it's cold out, it's April, it's still chilly, it's not Christmas, but
134620	140780	since I'm up here without any underwear on, oh, it's weather alert, I'm naked, I'm a child.
140780	145180	What do you got for me, Santa?
145180	147420	Well, Jeffy...
147420	148660	Just read the copy, Santa.
148660	150580	I've got me undies!
150580	152340	Talk about why they're the best underwear.
152340	154700	They're three times softer than cotton.
154700	157980	They use a space-age sustainable fabrics.
157980	158980	Excuse me, what?
158980	161980	And feel free to improvise.
161980	173140	Santa, I hope you're going to tell me that me undies has adventurous prints and designs,
173140	179140	and they're all limited edition, and new patterns are released every few weeks on rolling
179140	180140	bases.
180140	185980	Also, after you say yes or no to that, tell me what rolling bases means.
185980	191460	Rolling bases are the four bases of comfort.
191460	199180	First base, micromodal fabric, providing sustainable comfort.
199180	200180	Second base!
200180	204100	Third base is the patterns and designs that me undies come in.
204100	205100	Third base!
205100	208500	Third base is a satisfaction guarantee.
208500	210500	You could slide to ho-ho-ho-ome!
210500	215500	Don't let me look at Santa!
215500	216500	Santa!
216500	217500	Santa!
217500	218500	Santa!
218500	219500	Santa!

256220	257220	Santa!
257220	258220	You're overthinking it.
258220	259220	You had a good one.
259220	260220	You had a good one.
260220	261220	You're right.
261220	262220	All you have to do is just go on Dasher, on Rudolph.
262220	263220	You can just go away.
263220	264220	All right.
264220	274420	Or Santa, just read the call to action on this copy.
274420	275420	Go to...
275420	276420	What?
276420	277420	It's a no-brainer.
277420	278420	Read the call to action, Santa Claus.
278420	279420	You already did.
279420	280420	I did!
280420	281420	Damn.
281420	282420	I'm sorry.
282420	283420	I'm drunk.
283420	284420	I'm foreign.
284420	285420	I'm naked.
285420	286420	I'm sober.
286420	287420	Yeah.
287420	288420	I'm sober.
288420	289420	Yeah.
289420	290420	It's April, and Santa's here.
290420	291420	He's sober.
291420	293420	Shouldn't you be making toys instead of peddling children underwear in the middle of the night?
293420	294420	All right.
294420	295420	Let's start the show.
295420	296420	Hey, everybody!
296420	298420	Welcome to Uptown Burbank.
298420	302420	Harmontown is now in the session.
302420	304420	Zach, you got a beat for me?
304420	305420	No.
305420	306420	Where the fuck is Zach?
306420	307420	I just...
307420	308420	Zach, just...
308420	309420	Zach, just...
310420	311420	Yeah.
312420	313420	This is like a conformance.
313420	314420	That was exhilarating.
314420	315420	We do it cold open.
315420	316420	It might not...
316420	317420	Go ahead, go ahead.
317420	318420	No.
318420	319420	We'll have different cold opens.
319420	322420	Sometimes we'll just see plot threads, but we'll have them.
322420	327420	I think that what we just did was advertising history.
327420	330420	Oh, by the way, I'm Jeff Davis, your comptroller.
330420	331420	We're in Burbank, Harmontown.
331420	332420	It's now in session.
332420	334420	Let's welcome Spencer Crittenton, your game master.
334420	339420	You might recognize him from the recent Santa Claus Meundee's death.
339420	347420	Also, the star of Santa Claus and playing the role of Santa L. Claus, the mayor of Harmontown,
347420	348420	Mr. Dan Harmon.
348420	349420	Thank you.
349420	352420	See, it's already a better format because it didn't make...
352420	357420	And I knew it was never supposed to make sense what we were doing because we were performing
357420	358420	for nobody.
358420	360420	My thought was just do it.
360420	363420	I like making a little tweak like that.
363420	364420	We can do a cold open.
364420	369420	I can already be sitting up here, and then the music can play.
369420	370420	It's a cold open.
370420	371420	It feels professional.
371420	373420	It felt really professional.
373420	374420	It was good.
374420	385020	It was a capital P. If Harmontown can guarantee one thing, it's professionalism of our pre-roll
385020	386020	ads.
386020	387020	I also think it would be funny.
387020	398020	I remember on Oscar night, I got really excited for a second because clearly the Oscars weren't
398020	401020	even over, much less had we seen them, much less had we planned.
401020	404860	Then I riffed the dumb sarcastic thing of like, yeah, we've been rehearsing this show
404860	405860	all month.
405860	413020	But we should force ourselves before each show, we should decide, or we could do it
413020	414020	on stage.
414020	421020	But there should always be a fake, like a, there has to be a, a fake cold open.
421020	422020	A segment.
422020	423020	There has to be a sketch.
423020	424020	Yeah.
424020	425020	All right.
425020	426020	No, maybe not an opening, but we put a pin in that.
426020	427020	Oh, just a gag.
427020	431660	Or like SNL, we have to come out and do our Sarah Huckabee Sanders sketch.
431660	432660	Yeah.
432660	435900	It's happening tonight and we refer to it or whatever.
435900	438020	I don't know.
438020	442460	Are you suggesting we like just like think about the show at all?
442460	443460	Just a little bit.
443460	447740	Just that much that just enough to make it like willfully shittier, which would make
447740	448740	it better.
448740	449740	Cause it would be structural.
449740	450740	No, I get it.
450740	451740	Like, like, like we'd, we'd enjoy that.
451740	452740	They'd enjoy that.
452740	453740	Yeah.
453740	462820	No, I think they'd enjoy more effort on our part that might, that might go over, especially
462820	464340	the people that paid for it.
464340	465340	Yeah.
465340	469460	They might just, but no, I mean, I'm open to it.
469460	470460	Definitely.
470460	471460	No, I'm, I'm excited.
472460	477340	We got here an hour early to talk about business affairs.
477340	482100	And so we were here early and we were kind of already warmed up as opposed to just rolling
482100	483740	in right at eight o'clock.
483740	484740	Yeah.
484740	485740	Your voice is warmed up.
485740	491100	Nothing like talking about the podcast business to bring the spirit from your solar plexus
491100	493820	up into your joy chakra.
493820	498140	Uh, cause we all do this to have a good time, but that that's actually true.
498140	504420	I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I had an epiphany in therapy, uh, uh, and my, uh, therapist gave
504420	509300	me a fist bump, which she, she doesn't usually, you know, touch me and stuff.
509300	513540	And the sheet, she also kicked my foot, like, like, and she was getting up to schedule next
513540	514540	week's appointment.
514540	515540	She like kicked my foot.
515540	518060	Like, it's you.
518060	527740	She called me, she said I was transcend, trans, trans, wait, transforming now, I'm just trying
527740	538620	to, I've, I've, I've, I've, I'm transcending my, uh, roll out my native, uh, yeah, fuck
538620	539620	it.
539620	540620	You transcended your native?
540620	541620	What?
541620	542620	I dunno.
542620	543620	The thing that makes me naturally an asshole.
543620	545940	Tell me your, tell me more about your epiphany then.
545940	550220	Well it doesn't, yeah, I mean, whatever she, that was just her report card.
550220	552820	I, and I don't, I don't, that's not, that's not why I do therapy.
552820	555740	I don't do it to win therapy, but I won.
555740	559780	If my lesbian therapist reached across the table and fist bumped me and then give me
559780	564740	a little footsie kick, I would say that's, that's certainly transformational.
564740	565740	You have graduated.
565740	570180	And she's a married lesbian, by the way, for those who don't want, Jesus Christ, fuck.
570180	571180	Oh no.
571180	572180	Oh no.
572180	573180	Oh dear heavens.
573180	574180	Oh boy.
574180	585220	Dan was about to talk about his spiritual epiphanies.
586220	587220	Yeah.
587220	588220	Yeah.
588220	589220	Yeah.
589220	590220	Yeah.
590220	591220	Yeah.
591220	592220	Yeah.
592220	593220	Yeah.
593220	594220	Yeah.
594220	595220	Yeah.
595220	596220	Yeah.
596220	597220	Yeah.
597220	598220	Yeah.
598220	599220	Yeah.
599220	600220	Yeah.
600220	601220	Yeah.
601220	602220	Yeah.
602220	603220	Yeah.
603220	604220	Yeah.
604220	605220	Yeah.
605220	606220	Yeah.
606220	607220	Yeah.
607220	608220	Yeah.
608220	609220	Yeah.
609220	610220	Yeah.
610220	611220	Yeah.
611220	612220	Yeah.
612220	613220	Yeah.
614220	615220	Yeah.
616220	618220	You made a pretty brave entrance.
619220	622220	Steve said, Hey, you can just walk up on Steve.
622220	624220	Well that people love that.
624220	629220	And it didn't go wrong at any point it's it's it was it was just funny to watch you charge
629220	632220	into the Lake Michigan on a banana leaf.
633220	635220	And like it could be a boogie board.
635220	637220	It's probably not going to be a boogie board.
638220	639220	Well,
639220	646300	bookie board it's probably not gonna be a bookie board you charged into it all
646300	652060	right well I'm what did I interrupt spiritual journey you you've got
652060	655680	something you got something he was transcending something well we opened
655680	660200	the show with a something I just came up with in the moment I thought I said
660200	665760	let's do let's open the show with with the ad and we'll do a me and he's ad
665760	669600	well we'll still they'll still get their money no they got their ad if what we
669600	672800	did in the beginning was that's not good enough for me and he's my me and he's
672800	676600	can go fuck himself well for all I'm wearing them right now they might have
676600	681360	paid for a middle of the podcast ad we don't all I'm saying is they're still
681360	685080	gonna get whatever they paid for I was at the march yesterday for our lives for
685080	689320	the kids that don't want to get shot to death in schools and I went through my
689320	693600	me and these drawer and I was like what's the right me and these underwear

711320	718880	signs it's not there I might I might still be wearing don't don't don't yeah
719320	724280	don't do it might still be where he's still wearing a gentleman wake up in a
724280	733320	ditch I woke up with a taste of probably no gun control laws in my mouth
733320	739120	because nothing matters well yeah I wore my actual gun control me undies they had
739120	743360	like guns with X's on them for real yeah no so that's probably why it didn't work
743360	747440	as you weren't wearing the right underwear so what was your ad at the
747440	752640	beginning of the show it was a great and he's had yeah I did I did like a do
752640	758040	why don't we just run through let's just start it over can we take the lights
758040	762320	back down the twice how about this Dan Spencer how about this we redo it but
762320	766720	now Rob is in the scene okay he gets to interact that way it'll be way better
766720	774840	but Rob you don't have it sounded sarcastic no it didn't all right I mean
774840	779480	if you want to do the like you hey I don't have to switch I wasn't talking to

784820	795160	Spencer whoa whoa whoa Donner hold on there on the left there Jensen go
795160	803320	slower on this now melting rooftop oh guess it's a little easier to land on it
803320	817720	now that it's April it's a living hmm the chipmunks out and I'm unpacking my
817720	824760	bag of things to give to everybody I don't know who the fuck you are get the

840680	851920	variety of patterns but you'll have to be undies blocked all the bullets it must
851920	858720	be the micro modal fiber up into the sky me undies and that's Harman chat
858720	863120	commie slash me undies you see how Rob being in the scene just instantly plussed
863120	869280	it again sarcasm no that was honesty that was proving that my past sarcasm was
869280	874400	indeed honesty I think it's this that's making it feel sarcastic certainly makes
874400	881960	me harder to read yeah yeah put your hands somewhere else no

936000	945640	commercial for Kmart your saving place ma'am do you know why I pulled you over
945640	952520	no I don't officer it's because you didn't get these savings at Kmart oh
952720	959840	shirt ripped open look at the size of those big savings all this week at Kmart
959840	966880	20% off all brands and competing brands total of 40% off of each brand sub
966880	972520	brands are an additional 5% off it's a cumulative effect so if you get three
972520	978800	sub brands you'll have a total of 15% off brand related numbers I have a
978800	997320	coupon for motorboating put it put it in your life put it in Kmart it's the
997320	1005440	undies okay all right so that's how that would have gone right well the epiphany
1005440	1023440	that I had in therapy was that I nothing wrong with that every everybody in the
1023440	1031320	world no matter how far away they live from anyone else like we're all like you
1031320	1036880	know we're all in a crowded warehouse you can't you can't move that touching
1036880	1041800	everybody it's like if you go to anything like a crowded warehouse right
1041800	1050880	like a crowded warehouse I'm really undercutting my epiphany it doesn't
1050880	1059840	sound that good anymore but but but I I have been making mistake of because if
1059840	1067080	you if you if you pursue what you want like if you follow your goal like a like
1067080	1070640	like whatever that goal is but it can't be too complicated it can't be for
1070640	1074880	instance I gotta get out of the warehouse because then you're just gonna
1074880	1078720	get irritated because the all you can really do in the in the foreseeable
1078720	1082440	future is like move through a bunch of people but your goal might be like I
1082440	1087000	want to get to the west side of the warehouse I've never been over there and
1087000	1093160	and but ultimately the whatever the goal is it all falls under the giant
1093160	1100640	heading of I want to be happy so therefore and then you have these good
1100640	1106800	goals so the thing has to be not about the people that you're like then
1106800	1110000	there's all this stuff so you have to whenever you move through a crowd you
1110000	1114280	you're constantly having to go excuse me sorry no that's okay that's alright
1114280	1119640	there's people it's just a mess you know people are a mess like we we we we
1119640	1125720	we just everyone's at cross purposes and you're trying to be polite and graceful
1125720	1129160	and you don't be part of the problem and all of that stuff happening and it's
1129160	1136720	causing you like a lot of anxiety so like my epiphany was that I I have been
1136720	1142080	because of maybe like early on I was like oh wow it's this this is the worst
1142080	1147200	part right it's the part where you have to go like this so what what can I do
1147200	1155840	about that part which made me feel like I was being in the moment and being like
1155840	1164880	aware because if people who think about their goals are heartless people because
1164880	1169400	then they walk through everybody because they're going that way but you don't
1169400	1174640	have to choose between those two things like I was the people who when we shrink
1174640	1179000	back like that and we go oh I need my goal is I want to be the best person in
1179000	1185800	the world I want to be I want to I want to not step on any toes and or if someone
1185800	1189320	steps on my fucking toe this time you know like that we get into those moods
1189320	1195200	like I'm just gonna police my fucking leg it you're drawn back into this like
1195200	1200840	thing and then like you could do a lot of good that way you could even be like
1200840	1205000	you could become a kind of art installation because you could be like
1205000	1209280	here's what I'm gonna do because of the situation like I'm gonna stick my thumb
1209280	1215680	in my mouth and like blow on it and like I like like but it this is the part
1215680	1222120	where I can't bring it home but I'm just saying like now I understand like the
1222120	1228040	people that I like are the people that they don't they don't shrink back that
1228040	1232120	far to the point where they're just doing what everyone's doing which is
1232120	1238920	going I hope nobody hates me because if we all do that well maybe arguably that
1238920	1251120	would be utopia but like I think we like I want to like follow this meandering
1251120	1257800	dot of I want to be happy and get better having accepted that any path
1257800	1263440	takes you across everybody I want to get better at saying excuse me and I'm sorry
1263440	1269840	and you're forgiven and oh no problem and excuse me no I didn't see are you
1269840	1275400	saying like it's the it's the like when you're when you're trying to navigate
1275400	1279360	through that crowd and you're and you're trying really hard not to bump into
1279360	1282720	anybody not to interact and not to stiffen anybody's toes but also you
1282720	1287760	don't want to touch sweaty people right like that that's what's making you not
1287760	1292360	happy or miserable and you should just learn to kind of like be okay hoping
1292360	1296520	into being touched or or or like oh hey how you doing or being is that what
1296520	1301440	you're saying or enjoying well I'm using as a model and saying like you know
1301440	1305720	first of all no wrong answers except for each individual so let's say that you
1305720	1309520	don't like the let's say that that's like you're so there's some people that
1309520	1314680	go to a concert because they genuinely want to like fucking like rob up against
1314680	1319880	people or be even be punched by them or risk that factor like there's there's
1319880	1326080	just and then there's serial predators who flock to the situations of a crowd
1326080	1329640	because they can grope you and pretend they're not it's not their fault or
1329640	1334600	like like there's there's no value to this situation like there's no good and
1334600	1341360	evil observable you just zoom in on the individual are you within this writhing
1341360	1351480	sea of people that you can't escape are you going to define your entire life by
1351480	1358160	the moment to moment like oh that guy wouldn't have done that if he had any
1358160	1362080	respect for me and I oh I just hurt that person more than I should have and I
1362800	1367000	there's it's like you're talking emotional and physical like like like
1367000	1371480	like like emotional interactions or simply physical interactions I'm talking
1371480	1378440	about I'm talking about down in the encounter to encounter level of your
1378440	1383280	right human existence and then not pulling back to the size of a planet so
1383280	1388160	that you become a nihilist and go sheeps to the slaughter give me more bacon and
1388160	1393560	forensic file I did like I'm saying like if you pull back to a resolution
1393560	1398880	that's like one person's anxiety about every encounter they have to have as
1398880	1404880	they move through life as one core puzzle in a stream of them or one
1404880	1409120	cockroach in a nest of them or one of like like like pick whatever beautiful
1409120	1414920	or disgusting thing you want to say we're part of a biomass so if you pull
1414920	1419760	back a couple of those human units not a thousand not a million but just like
1419760	1425560	ten or something like the amount of energy it takes to decide that you want
1425560	1434200	to leave a party because you don't like it like well in order to do that I'd
1434200	1439040	have to like I might be so intense on leaving this party that I'm gonna end up
1439040	1444320	hurting it's like you you could just charge out you could charge out the door
1444320	1449000	metaphorically you could like knock over coffee tables not to mention step on
1449000	1455480	someone's toe without apologizing and or and then like even God imagine like the
1455480	1459880	Irish goodbye factor of like I didn't even Susan was upstairs taking a shit
1459880	1463240	when I left and I don't know yeah you said bye to me and not me taking a B
1463240	1470400	lying out the door is yeah I've always considered it it's a dichotomy between
1470400	1477520	there's a binary choice between total self-interest and altruism but it was
1477520	1482400	that was not true it was a binary choice between living a life of total
1482400	1490520	self-paralyzing anxiety and knowing who the fuck I am right like because this is
1490520	1496560	easy being anxious going everybody hates me everybody loves me I hope I
1496560	1500920	don't do that yeah I think again it's like it's it's like I'm like that's my
1500920	1505960	excuse to like do nothing and go nowhere so have you put that into play
1505960	1515600	like snow I just thought of it like Friday but well how about us can you put
1515600	1520960	that into play can you like activate that part of you well I open the show
1520960	1526320	with a Christmas ad from young days fucking did I had a an epiphany with my
1526320	1531160	therapist this week you found out she was my therapist no and then I paid her
1531160	1536560	to keep an eye on you it's a different therapist you're spying on Rob through
1536560	1543240	your no I hope not you paid a therapist to like somehow like you did like a
1543360	1548600	fucking inception thing or no not inception it's the game Michael Douglas
1548600	1553020	thing that led them to their that goes against my Hippocratic oath everybody
1553020	1557400	has a price yeah and you've paid so much that she's just now gathering shit on
1557400	1561320	sure yeah or or honestly if they're a therapist and they said like don't you
1561320	1565400	think this is kind of unhealthy you all you have to do is say or is it so
1565400	1573920	healthy dot dot dot and then they'd be like me there I am required to consider
1573920	1578920	that possibility I'm a therapist what was your epiphany trap well I think it's
1578920	1582960	similar to what you're saying if I'm hearing you right Dan it's like because
1582960	1586240	I was like I've been telling her about like what I'm going through like
1586240	1591360	creatively and how I'm just like I wake up every morning going it's over with
1591360	1596200	and I'm tired and I'm just sad and I just I don't have the juice anymore and
1596200	1601560	it's not fun and and she says oh it's like if I'm alone I'd Kate's been out of
1601560	1605840	town all week so I've been really kind of phone just like phoning in my life
1605840	1610000	and sleeping all day and eating like shit and I just have like the voices in
1610000	1613600	my head are just being very the critical mind yeah the critical mind is like just
1613600	1619840	like you know on overload and and so she she was like saying that like the
1619840	1625400	critical mind is is well it goes back to being like the lizard brain in your
1625400	1633320	head where it's like saying stay in your cave stay away from the unknown keep
1633320	1639200	your belly full don't take any chances risk averse yeah exactly don't do any of
1639200	1645480	that because it's because it's it and it makes you survive the biological fed has
1645480	1652640	set the interest rates higher right so to speak and and then like ad like like
1652640	1657600	that's all like our like ancient you know primitive instincts already in our
1657600	1662560	head then add on top of like trying to to being socially domesticated and all
1662560	1667240	that and voices of your parents and teachers capitalism yeah yeah and so so
1667240	1673120	she was like she was like she was like saying like could you befriend that voice
1673120	1678840	in your head you know could you befriend it because really that friend
1678840	1683760	that voice in your head is a friend is somebody who cares about you that's only
1683760	1687960	trying to protect you like when they say what when it's like don't don't dream
1687960	1693080	too big don't dream too big or you're you know like cuz why why is that voice
1693080	1697640	telling you that because it doesn't want your heart to get broken but in order to
1697640	1704480	to achieve what you really want to do you have to risk right that and and and
1704480	1711440	and so you know if you could have a conversation with that voice in your head
1711440	1718600	and say hey listen thank you I'm sorry I was so angry about trying to push you
1718600	1726760	away I should embrace you I know you're I was just trying to help Bruce Willis
1726760	1731960	yeah I know you're trying to look out for me yeah but sometimes I gotta run
1731960	1736320	over the glass yeah don't you ever think if Bruce Willis is your critical voice
1736320	1742200	maybe you should take seriously yeah no no I should I should I mean if Bruce
1742200	1746360	Willis is my critical voice I would be like this whole tower is gonna go down
1746360	1753200	buddy yeah oh what do you want me to do just sit here and watch it happen no I
1753400	1757240	don't want you to I don't want you to sit there I want you to what do I do what I
1757240	1771080	don't know I'm asking me hold tight wait for the police it's a Hudson Hawk
1771080	1776240	trailer well I thought I was trying to be poignant in that the critical voice
1776240	1781040	that doesn't it's not always the annoyed from that that's the thing is like I
1781040	1785320	think that's what we're afraid of of running is that like oh yeah but my
1785320	1791920	critical voice is actually it's not an ugly booger man from a car lot
1791920	1795760	commercial or it's like I hate high prices or low prices or whatever that
1795760	1801400	guy would hate it's more like the little seizures guy I hate I love high prices I
1801400	1806560	love them or I am high well a booger a booger man would probably hate low
1806560	1812760	prices I think I'm this is from if you haven't seen it watch the early Robert
1812760	1817080	Zemeckis film starring Kurt Russell used cars they do a commercial in it and the
1817080	1825600	guy has to play high prices oh yeah does he play it I think he I remember him was
1825600	1830360	looking like a fruit of the loom guy I can't remember what the costume was we
1830360	1836240	had like come out and then like they did like a squib effect like like like high
1836240	1839880	prices fuck you and they like they blow them up with a shotgun or whatever and
1839880	1844040	it's all like squibs and blood and stuff and you're you know it's like these guys
1844040	1852120	are underdogs like they're they're too effective at selling used cars yeah they're
1852120	1858680	too effective so yeah so I mean putting it that way like befriending the critical
1858680	1864920	mind and realizing that it's it it's actually something that doesn't hate you
1864920	1869520	and doesn't want you to fail it's just trying to protect you and so if when
1869520	1875960	that voice or that that attitude is in your head she's a get into the habit of
1875960	1885760	saying thank you I understand go fuck yourself this being nice just like I
1885760	1892080	understand you're trying to help me here but this and usually I would like pay
1892080	1896080	attention to you like not run out into traffic you know not eat bad food or
1896080	1901400	it's time to get out of bed or whatever but this is a time where I need to risk
1901400	1908760	being hurt I think the pain is worth it so I'm gonna need you to just trust me
1908760	1913720	on this one and and if in the voice you know we if you know it well enough we'll
1913720	1918200	go okay I'm here if you need me you know it's just that that's beautiful I love
1918200	1923800	it and it really it started thinking of it that way it really started kind of
1923800	1929160	reprogramming here I can think like that that's a wonderful idea like like I used
1929160	1932360	to draw a lot but I don't draw anymore because the reason I don't draw is I
1932360	1936360	think I'm mad at it now yeah because something in your head saying why are
1936360	1939320	you doing why are you doing this you know you're just gonna draw the same stupid
1939320	1943320	shit you always draw but I need to befriend that voice and say well let's
1943320	1947000	just try yeah let's let's look what's the worst thing that could happen the
1947000	1951160	only way to get better at it is to keep practicing it so why don't you be quiet
1951160	1957920	for a bit or watch me or if I fail guess what you're right yeah or tell me how to
1957920	1961560	make it better yeah you know like say like if it's like oh you're you're
1961560	1964680	crosshatching is bad or you're just you're okay well that's something I will
1964680	1969400	concentrate on instead of just like going it's over with don't even try
1969400	1973840	because that's that's what what the lizard brain is trying to do it's like
1974560	1979040	don't go into the dark forest a lot of times we get programmed to go like you
1979040	1985280	gotta you gotta you gotta punch that no you can't voice in the face and you're
1985280	1990880	and it's like that actually could be the that lizard like to the extent that it
1990880	1997320	wants you mitigated ie like that's what a that's what a sheep dog does it's like
1997320	2000560	kind of vaguely threatens the sheep because it loves them wants to keep them
2000560	2006160	in a certain area along a certain path and so getting mad at it actually is
2006160	2011680	part of its function whereas if if you were a sheep and you wanted to you know
2011680	2016200	maybe supersede a sheep dogs authority because maybe you're a sheep that wants
2016200	2020880	to herd to go in a different direction the actual practical thing to do would
2020880	2027280	be to not like tangle with the sheep dog but to like go around behind it and bid
2027280	2030960	a good day and we'll be nice to it what you want me to go over here okay great
2030960	2034040	sounds like a good idea because you probably how long have you been a sheep
2034040	2037320	dog like like like it's kind of you kind of crazy because you look kind of like a
2037320	2040280	sheep like your furs like my friend but they don't turn yours in sweaters how
2040280	2044080	is that Jeremy over there and you just kind of like you're not enemies with the
2044080	2048600	critical voice the threshold Guardians can be tamed by assimilation I think
2048600	2052680	that there's like on a pseudoscientific level or whatever I think that you're
2052680	2056840	what you're talking about is the survival mechanism associated with
2056840	2059520	fight-or-flight which is associated with heightened state of emotion states
2059520	2064520	of panic yeah and I think that when you engage in an emotional angry traumatic
2064520	2068400	way to those feelings on an emotional level like you would if someone is
2068400	2072480	telling you your shit at everything it gets you into a more emotional state
2072480	2076320	which is more prone to that part of your brain whereas what you're describing is
2076320	2079800	a very rational it's the other part of your mind the societal kind of control
2079800	2083360	part of your mind that's that's not at all it's divorced from that that lizard
2083360	2087880	part and it sounds like you're intentionally not trying to channel
2087880	2092240	those pathways that reinforce what what the negative stuff is saying and you're
2092240	2096360	you're instead choosing pathways that take you away from that so you're when
2096360	2099440	you say you're reprogramming I it's what you're doing it sounds like is actively
2099440	2103600	reprogramming the way you're thinking yeah it's also a very subtle simple idea
2103600	2109600	is that befriend the part of you that argues with yourself the thing that you
2109600	2113720	hate yourself when you get like a lot of people are going oh I hate myself or
2113720	2118280	whatever because the critical mind is like going through every little piece of
2118280	2121480	your life every second of your life going you did that wrong fucked up what
2121480	2124800	a news you're gonna wear that what's that I mean it sounds like a fan that
2124800	2130360	sounds like exactly yeah yeah you've got like a reddit in your head that's like
2130360	2134880	saying everything you do is a comment section whatever but but yeah but the
2135160	2139880	the reality is is those those voices and read it are your biggest fans otherwise
2139880	2144080	they wouldn't be paying attention to every second of your life but the a lot
2144080	2148960	of us you know well just speaking of me we were I mean we're all we're all
2148960	2153840	monkey dogs when we come out of our mothers and we're just eating food and
2153840	2158560	rolling around we wouldn't dress or bathe unless somebody went no stop it
2158560	2165080	you know and so you're you learn how to become a civilized human being by being
2165080	2171760	told no stop it Robbie no now stop it no do you have to do that and it's like you
2171760	2176000	hear that voice over and over and over again and that was that's programmed
2176000	2180880	into your head and still into adulthood I hear my mom's voice going no oh you're
2180880	2186520	lazy stop doing and this was this is just her way of saying I'm worried you're
2186520	2190720	not hear that voice when you're doing something it has nothing to do with the
2190720	2193760	things that she was in charge of yes keeping you from falling down stairs
2193760	2197880	walking to the street touching hot stoves like it's not even that person
2197880	2201720	anymore and I'm not that that no she was you only had that relationship with that
2201720	2205520	stuff but then it's called toxic shame when it's like misappropriated but it's
2205520	2211280	very much like like when lolly is barking at a skateboard that goes by I've
2211280	2219040	learned to what is this yeah I learned that if I clap my hands she'll like go
2219040	2225760	like like she'll like flinch and she'll stop barking and so like if I so now
2225760	2230320	whenever she does anything bad like I'll clap my hands not even hard and I'll be
2230320	2233920	on the other side of the room and she knows that that's time to stop you know
2233920	2239960	so I'm her critical mind now every time she thinks she's doing something she's
2239960	2243800	gonna be in her head thinking like and if she wanted to succeed as an animal
2243800	2248440	she would learn to befriend of that critical mind perhaps fetch its balls
2248440	2254440	once in a while and then one fateful day eat its throat in its sleep and go
2254440	2259920	into wait that's a girl that's over the line to me killing me yeah I'm gonna I'm
2259920	2269200	gonna yeah it's a you're reacting like I like I said something bad about her like
2269200	2273360	I made a joke about hurting an animal you're the you know I'm I'm a I'm your
2273360	2279360	friend all right all right okay not right well I the boot the boot the boot
2279360	2286600	a fella Spencer hey do you do you ever hear the story of the Christmas without
2286600	2304320	underwear no there's an old story about it hello little children there'll be no
2304320	2312040	underwear for Christmas this year yes I'm sorry to say all the underwear is
2312040	2320640	made out of horrible shit cotton not even close to micro modal yeah so no
2320640	2325040	Christmas this time oh no my balls are rubbing up against this not diamond
2325040	2327600	shaped pouch
2342040	2355160	I'm dead 500 years later and that was a story about the Christmas with no
2355160	2364440	underwear grandfather yes what undergarments could they have won had
2364440	2384760	they could have had yeah there's a Buddhist parable I don't know of what I
2384760	2391120	speak it comes to me courtesy of my therapist it's the thing that you're
2391120	2393640	talking about we're talking about befriending the critical mind there's
2393640	2400640	also like the you know it's this there was this goddess named Mara I think who
2400640	2406600	at some point where the Buddha was doing his thing in the tree which was like
2406600	2411120	just ignoring everything and then there was like temptations and things and
2411120	2415160	there was a goddess named Mara that was particularly like kind of you know tried
2415160	2421000	to get in his head and the phrase I see you Mara like you don't have to be like
2421000	2425960	go fuck yourself die by fire or whatever like you just like you actually
2425960	2432200	acknowledge you feed the troll sometimes yeah maybe all the time I just go like
2432200	2442960	yeah I I my my my erstwhile trainer Dave Klein said of people who troll like
2442960	2447640	something I thought was kind of profound which was actually even those people
2447640	2451240	they're just trying to connect with you which is different from from giving them
2451240	2456920	credit for doing anything smarter funny or cool you can still like look down on
2456920	2460960	them ago you're a dumb piece of shit that's that's would that that is
2460960	2466000	choosing this method to try in some way to connect with me like like there's
2466000	2471840	absolutely no like they might be lost to cynicism and like all this shit but like
2472080	2478000	it you you got to admit they're like still there's like that's their disease
2478000	2482840	is that they're going like I wish I had an effect on you yeah just like kind of
2482840	2489720	kind of uplifting it is it's interesting because whenever you hear that critical
2489720	2497040	mind voice in your head in whatever form it is your first instinct is to go shut
2497040	2503040	up leave me alone go away and a way to deal with it and it never works it
2503040	2508600	always comes back but a way to deal with it is to win it when it goes you're a
2508600	2513160	piece of shit why are you why aren't you working right now if you would just like
2513160	2519680	say okay hold on why are you saying that to me I work an awful lot but why why
2519680	2523400	running jobs do you want me to have as many as it takes you know it's like
2523400	2527000	yeah asking it what it wants yeah what do you want what do you what would make
2527000	2533600	you happy what would make you critical mind stop like saying that to me church
2533600	2536440	just texted me by the way instead of it's it's Maya not Mara Maya means
2536440	2541640	illusion oh okay it's Maya that's amazing that it means illusion like the
2541640	2549080	software yeah like the animation software the illusion software it makes
2549160	2557280	yeah I make stuff that it isn't real yeah I guess sorry I'm trying to I'm
2557280	2562320	tabulating in my head I'm like did my therapist fuck up that name or did I but
2562320	2566080	I don't know why I would you said Mara and I just shut her grounds at church
2566080	2568200	because if anybody would know it in the building it would be her and she was
2568200	2577920	like yeah she shook you off like Johnny Bench sure oh you do I see I see I see
2577920	2580920	you illusion yeah that actually makes it more profound instead of creating
2580920	2588400	like just another like crazy lady character yeah yeah she want to come up
2588400	2592440	and talk about like photographing the the march
2607920	2614600	hello hello with the with the the of course the terms of service agreement
2614600	2618560	at all guests check which is that at any time you may say a word or syllable
2618560	2626440	that makes me launch into a sputtering rant about how I'm not racist but we
2626440	2631440	were down yeah we went down to the march and I kind of I just I thought it was I
2631440	2637520	I I don't know I don't know how to tee you up I'm not a good a tear but because
2637520	2640240	I don't want to make you feel pretentious and say like church why don't you talk
2640240	2644360	about how profound the imagery you captured was but it was like but but
2644360	2648200	actually just like I thought it was cool you talking about how it was sort of
2648200	2652640	like ducks in a barrel for photographers because of the simplicity of the theme
2652640	2656480	you want to go from there well yeah I mean what I noticed in what was making
2656480	2660320	me so emotional I mean aside from just what was actually happening which is
2660320	2666240	seeing so many kids and even really really little kids marching and angry
2666240	2674160	and thoughtfully expressing that anger and having these brilliant signs that I
2674160	2679240	just I could I could not stop crying you guys walked past me at a certain point I
2679240	2682920	stopped and just stood there and let the crowd kind of like move toward me and
2682920	2687520	around me because that's the best way to see everything because if you keep just
2687520	2690200	marching with the crowd as a photographer you're you're surrounded by
2690200	2695840	the same 20 people as you move down the street so for me I I stop at some point
2695840	2699920	and that just seemed like the right place to stop but all the other
2699920	2705480	protests that I've photographed if you looked at all those photos together
2705480	2710120	would look like they could be any protest because you see a lot of the
2710120	2714200	same signs because we have so there's so much intersectionality with all of these
2714200	2718680	issues there's so many issues happening at the same time and so you're seeing
2718680	2723260	the same things all the time there's always the rainbow afro guy with the
2723260	2739700	John 319 people he loved them he also didn't sorry I was trying to interject
2739700	2745940	very quick how can a lot of these how big we was the big right it was big I
2745940	2750180	haven't seen the final numbers but a few days to tabulate and kind of estimate
2750180	2754340	the crowd size but it seemed it seemed really big there were over 800,000 in
2754340	2762460	DC that's the only number I know so far but because I was that this was the the
2762460	2767340	only protest that for me in pictures you know exactly what it is and it's
2767340	2772460	completely on one topic right there's nothing else being talked about and you
2772460	2777500	can see that in just the images and even if you like let's take partisan
2777500	2783180	politics aside and people say that I hate the GOP or I'm a total liberal or
2783180	2789420	like I'm anti or pro NRA if you just look at the children that were there the
2789420	2792780	expressions on their faces were different than other protests they
2792780	2797940	looked scared and pissed off and not like what if like I'm trying to picture
2797940	2808060	myself if I were 13 14 16 18 I was still in school where what side would I
2808060	2813620	fall on and how angry would I be in which direction I might have been the
2813620	2818900	pros Second Amendment guy I might have been the fuck the Second Amendment I
2818900	2826340	don't know but watching kids look fucking miserable and looked really there
2826340	2831580	there's a couple on churches Instagram there's that last one there's no sign
2831580	2835540	the girl might have just been tired she might just be a kid that was tired of
2835540	2839500	being in a march but there's a picture of her looking right at camera and she
2839500	2844460	just looks fucking sad and I look at those photos and I just start crying
2844460	2855220	because I put myself in those little shoes and I don't give a fuck what you
2855220	2860020	think about gun rights or gun legislation or whatever there's a bunch
2860020	2864420	of fucking kids that are afraid to go to school I have a niece that's fucking
2864420	2868740	eight and I've got friends that are like have children that are going to school
2868740	2873300	and let's not make it about politics or make it about Trump or make it about
2873300	2880060	Paul Ryan who's a cunt sorry I meant to say cunt
2880060	2886180	what what's happening is like imagine being a kid going to the mall now going
2886180	2890940	to a movie theater like it's fucking crazy we shouldn't make celebrities out
2890940	2895060	of Emma Gonzalez for being the first cool chick to get up and say a bunch of
2895060	2898420	awesome stuff I think that's dangerous I think like that puts her in a bad
2898420	2902820	situation but I think that you should go around and look at churches photos and
2902820	2907740	look at the kids that were marching that day they're scared their friends are
2907860	2913100	they're scared they really are and my nephews were going to march and then my
2913100	2917580	sister text me on Friday night and she said that my my nephews had kind of had
2917580	2921060	a little bit of a panic attack about it that they wanted so much to be a part of
2921060	2925100	it but that they were really scared to go to the march and so she said you know
2925100	2930900	you don't have to go let's write letters to our representatives why don't you why
2930900	2934020	don't you call we'll call our representatives and you can get on the
2934020	2936860	phone and you can leave a message you can read your letter and leave a message
2936860	2940620	but like kids are genuinely panicked and that's kind of one of the things
2940620	2946660	that seeing that at the march looking into their faces and seeing how
2946660	2951860	seriously I mean I watched very young like four or five year old kids like who
2951860	2955940	seem to very much understand what was going on and have really real feelings
2955940	2959860	about it so there's all these accusations floating around like oh
2959860	2963540	these they couldn't possibly understand and they're too young to get it and
2963540	2966260	they're just parroting their parents views or they're being manipulated or
2966260	2968700	whatever but like you know what go to one of these marches and look at them
2968700	2973340	and say it to their face yeah that's the thing that I wanted to interject with
2973340	2979020	was I'm sure there's plenty of cynical people who have plenty of like whatever
2979020	2984260	you we've discussed this comments on her photos and my photos of Spencer holding
2984260	2990500	a sign there's a lot of hate but here's the thing is like imagery like yeah I
2990500	2994340	don't even want to it's like we'll look at the relationship between the parents
2994340	2997940	and the children in the imagery look at look at the mothers with the daughters
2997940	3003260	on their shoulders and go ahead and start from the point of assumption that
3003260	3008540	the little girl doesn't have any fucking idea what a gun is and understand how
3008540	3014860	much more sad this becomes because it's a photograph of a relationship between a
3014860	3019620	mother and daughter but they do the kids are now having to learn like the Cold
3019620	3024700	War where they had to do duck and cover drills because of doomsday like nuclear
3024700	3030380	warfare they now have to go have quiet the quiet game the quiet the silent game
3030380	3034500	anybody anybody with that kind of critical voice of like of like like oh
3034500	3037900	the kids they don't know how could you make this their problem it's just like
3037900	3042900	we've definitely got to the point where that that argument is so fucking dumb
3042900	3048380	because that's exactly everyone's argument like and that was the really
3048380	3052740	effective like somber mood I thought a lot of the signs and stuff was like the
3052740	3057900	theme was whether it was a parent that made a sign for a kid or the kid that
3057900	3063500	made a sign for themselves like the overwhelming theme was like I shouldn't
3063500	3069380	have to be involved with this I don't this shouldn't be it shouldn't have come
3069380	3073780	to this I shouldn't be a voice in this conversation we should we should have
3073780	3078380	all been on the same page about me a long time ago it's like legally yeah
3078380	3081980	etc so there's one little girl in particular that make made me think that
3081980	3085500	and I watched her for a while I have a bunch of pictures of her and a little
3085500	3089300	bit of a video that I posted of her with her little friend too that one's crazy
3089300	3095180	and her mother had a sign that just said save her and was pointing down because
3095180	3098380	she knew her daughter would be at her feet most of the time which is what
3098380	3101700	caught my eye and made me start watching this little girl then her and her friend
3101700	3106340	were like watching these older kids standing on a barricade and they were
3106340	3110740	you know chanting like this is what democracy looks like and we call BS and
3110740	3114580	all this and at one point these two little girls and one this one girl just
3114580	3118660	had such a look of concern like she was looking around like isn't this obvious
3118660	3123660	yeah yeah like look at all these people and they were chanting vote them out
3123660	3128940	vote them out and she was staring at them and then at one point she just
3128940	3133860	started vote them out yeah vote them out like she had like a realization of
3133860	3139340	like yeah that's what we do and yes vote them out she was stomping her little
3139340	3143900	feet and I just burst into tears and she looks like one of those photos I
3143900	3148340	forget the photographer that took those great photos of the Great Depression of
3148340	3153860	a little yeah the kids little girl covered in like you know soot her dirt
3153860	3161260	and the scared look on her face and she looked absolutely concerned yeah like
3161260	3168820	like scared miserable and she's like this isn't a drill this is some actual
3168820	3172980	shit and if people want to say oh the parents were brainwashing them fuck you
3172980	3177780	but also just imagine like you're five you'd play the silent game it's been
3177780	3180820	explained to you what it's about you're gonna go and you're gonna hide and
3180820	3184060	you're gonna stay quiet for as long as the drill and then you're gonna get a
3184060	3188660	little treat if you stay quiet the whole time and then going to the march and
3188660	3194580	putting into context what is actually like this is the silent this is what the
3194580	3198340	silent game is about this is what everybody's yelling about yeah and
3198340	3202740	everyone's holding signs of pictures of rifles and sign that say no more silence
3202740	3208580	stop gun violence fuck silence start screaming this little girl stomping that
3208580	3214740	video you took is like we're sitting at the Redwood I was like was crying crazy

3389180	3394660	know I look when we booked him he's it's it said gun control issues I like I'm
3394660	3399180	gun control like I don't I don't like legally it's awareness of good I think
3399180	3402180	that you're kind of one of those liberal elites that thinks what you hear the
3402180	3409180	name MC gun control he wants to ban guns yeah no he's he's he wants to open the
3409180	3412780	debate about gun control right but it's very clear that he's in the pocket of
3412780	3417100	the NRA yeah he wants to tie me with trigger locks what I mean isn't it come
3417100	3420540	on the people who act like this issue is complicated I should have known I should
3420540	3425140	have known but I just I never even I just wanted to get into the game and
3425140	3429220	like help people you know I thought that was all fine really I thought it was
3429220	3433620	right I thought it was fine I thought it was all right an argument could be made
3433620	3438660	that MC gun control if it's true that all he wants to do is is rap about gun
3438660	3442100	control awareness it wants to talk it was open up the issue that then whatever
3442100	3446340	you come into the whatever you experience during once you're aware then
3446340	3450260	we would hope I would think that the reason we want what we want is because
3450300	3457700	more people want it so so look I was shocked about to hear that he said he
3457700	3462700	was paid by the way he I was simply asking the question and I didn't get a
3462700	3466700	good answer I'll tell you I heard MC gun control he said that he had crossed it
3466700	3471260	out but at one point his parents had a writer where they requested money from
3471260	3475900	the NRA I think three hundred seventy five thousand dollars per gig he was
3475900	3479020	trying to argue the point that he was only allowed to talk about certain
3479020	3487940	bullet points and I can't even man is back on display I'm sure this will make
3487940	3496900	all the writers in the chimney IndieWire tomorrow look I want to just if I may
3496900	3502140	speak since that seemed to be the attraction of the century if I may if I
3502140	3508660	may I assume that my voice is something you'd want to hear am I correct in that
3508660	3511540	can we go back to the question that I asked you just get a simple yes or no
3511540	3519020	okay did you or did you not receive money from the NRA at any point in the
3519020	3525460	last year no so you did not now receive three hundred and seventy five thousand
3525460	3531980	dollars from the gun lobby here's the thing okay the foundation that pays me
3531980	3538700	is an awareness raising organization they have that they that money came
3538700	3546860	from the NRA yes it did not go to gun so the NRA is an awareness organization
3546860	3551260	that's why they're tax-exempt are you just talking about the NRA again yeah look
3551260	3556180	you can play gotcha games like if you say anything enough it'll sound real but
3556180	3560600	like that is it that is a fact the NRA is tax exempt because they are raising
3560600	3565720	awareness okay I mean I don't do taxes so like I'm not an accountant
3565720	3572600	personally I'm just a trigger guard and I'm in favor of gun control and I'm a
3572600	3579320	rapper we have those are three things that are true and then the thing that
3579320	3584800	you said I got back on that like that's why I came back I neutralized that I
3584800	3598000	got that are you a rapper yeah yeah yes or no yeah I'll let you heard commercial
3598000	3603560	can we put a beat on just to find out whether or not you're actually right no

4155620	4160620	sinister when you're gay and you're not allowed to say it today one day in the
4160620	4164980	future I'll be allowed but all the children will be over plowed with
4164980	4182980	bullets that's the real mommy that's the real mommy that's the real mommy did
4182980	4191460	Vincent did Vincent Price posthumously come out in that song yeah right make
4191460	4196220	it was in a cellular closet yeah he probably saw that but he wish he was
4196220	4200420	here in today where he would be more accepted but he's like how ironic my
4200420	4206620	kids would be killed or my friends kids or my adopted kids because because gay
4206620	4212500	yeah it's all right yeah I like him better because he's gay dude wait don't
4212500	4217220	even imply that that's not the case with me you just tried to high road me about
4217220	4222260	about gave in some price my hero you just made a mistake because I wasn't
4222260	4226060	right well maybe you're obsessed with gayness cuz you think it's like more
4226060	4230860	important than all the great work he did pricing I don't think so well this
4230860	4241140	seems weird who do you think one vote now don't forget your spider votes will
4241140	4249140	climb up your face and make you scared looks like looks like you guys had a
4249140	4255700	real fun time at that toga party this weekend Wow Wow everybody got in just up
4255700	4260420	and yeah it's been real nice it's been real nice invited to one of those Wow
4260420	4267460	how was that looks good looks fun yeah you sent Steve Levy off to go yeah from
4267460	4271740	that from the March for our lives yeah Steve Levy had to go off and buy togas
4271740	4286640	to a party that seemed pretty pretty fun I don't I was a guest at a toga party so
4286640	4294860	you didn't have fun okay I can't invite other people to a friends of the voice
4294860	4299500	in your head we all like Michael it was his engagement party our friend Michael
4299500	4306460	Waldron who works at Starburns industry and you and you were like oh I guess okay
4306460	4311020	Dan probably just thought that we didn't support their engagement so I don't
4311020	4316140	think he that's probably why Dan didn't invite us to Michael I just remembered I
4316140	4319220	did a thing here's it here's a weird thing I did at the part at Michael
4319220	4326300	Waldron's toga themed engagement party he had a basket of of blankets that were
4326300	4330740	kind of like I think they were like like leave behinds like like like like party
4330740	4334740	favors like you it's a toga party you might get cold we're on a patio take
4334740	4337440	this night they get ordered they got a bunch of blankets and I think you could
4337440	4339920	like wrap it around your shoulder and then leave with it it's kind of a kind
4339920	4347100	of a thoughtful interesting little artisanal idea I I started realizing at
4347100	4350540	some point I bet it's gonna get cold and I saw somebody wearing one of them
4350540	4356860	and I here's what I did I went down to the basket because I was like I'm hot
4356860	4361180	right now the Sun's out but it's gonna get cold later and these blankets are
4361180	4365980	gonna be gone so I took a blanket a free blanket that was like in a full basket
4365980	4370420	like representing all this hospitality and I I like I imagine I was like hunched
4370420	4374380	over like a like a candy cane posture because I became just this stop-motion
4374380	4380080	villain I creeped off into the underbrush the outskirts of their home
4380080	4384820	and I it the blanket is probably still there right now because I hid it you
4384820	4389460	hid the blanket the way I hid the Brown Deer Public Library's only copy of
4389460	4392700	slaughterhouse five because I had too many books and I couldn't get it so I
4392700	4400820	hid it because no one else deserved it Jesus Christ Michael you never wore the
4400820	4405020	blanket no I never needed it was fine whether it was funny a blank is to go
4405020	4409060	around good retrieve it and put it back in the blanket nope it wasn't the issue
4409060	4412180	which you ashamed well no I never thought about it again I'm a fucking
4412180	4418220	sociopath then I've known you for a long time you've committed various crimes
4418220	4421380	that's that's your most egregious I didn't ever not a sociopath because
4421380	4425500	whatever the like it was the opposite problem a sociopath would be like well
4425500	4428660	maybe it'll get cold I guess I could mug one of these people for their blankets
4428660	4443660	or whatever I don't miss my friends it's someone else's engagement party
4443660	4448260	like what what do you guys want them to do invite every human I'll have you
4448260	4453700	know I was invited so now talk to him she threw this shit away at the end of
4453700	4457860	the March Cody was like okay so like I'll see you later right and I was like
4457860	4462060	what she's like Waldron's thing and I was like what thing and she was like
4462060	4469980	happens you know Waldron probably better than I do church because you work with
4469980	4477700	them day in and day out every day Michael Waldron also Michael Waldron is
4477700	4483020	probably one of the biggest donors to the NRA that works at Starbirds I think
4483020	4488180	bankroll them follow the follow the money Rob Church follow the money on
4488180	4493380	both sides there are many sides to the follow the money is such a funny goddamn
4493380	4498900	phrase I remember like follow the money somebody somebody pointed out that Pat
4498900	4503660	say Jack was that his Twitter account is just him in his twilight years kind of
4503660	4510420	like he was a big climate change denier and then he would he would use hashtag
4510420	4513340	he would he would say stuff about climate change being full of shit and
4513340	4517020	then he used the hashtag follow the money he was supposed to follow the
4517020	4525940	climate change non-denial money where does that money go it's a big pizza gate
4525940	4531540	you know where that money goes to buying more vowels yeah games at Chuck
4531540	4536740	Woolery that's a hilarious joke see that's why that's why I missed it live
4536740	4541900	audience because buying vowels but I would have killed I don't you think it's
4541900	4545020	nice that we got used to not needing an audience I like that because it's like
4545020	4549660	you just respect jokes for what they are regardless of the reaction they get not
4549660	4553180	laugh at them yeah I just go like it's like it's like it's like we're gonna
4553180	4556580	we're gonna go start doing shows we're getting kicked out of here next we're
4556580	4560140	gonna start doing shows with an odd yeah we haven't even mentioned I'm doing it
4560140	4565740	I'm doing an all live show at the Saban theater in Beverly Hills it's all Stephen

4595660	4602260	back let's take the time to find it and then pipe it through the sound system for
4602260	4607580	that play it back for the no audience Jeff who hasn't heard it we're on a
4607580	4614300	stage we're on a stage with lights but with no audience we're basically just
4614300	4624580	glorified let's do it galar brothers which are you saying that it's my fault

4964700	4965700	the theater.
4966220	4975700	They had just not given up and diarrhea ran off and then you guys decided to look for
4975700	4977580	him.
4977580	4983700	You decided that the most obvious place to look for him was in the theater and then you
4983700	4987060	went, you broke into the theater, you went into the kitchen, you went to the stage looking
4987060	4988060	around.

5072300	5073620	There was a point, you know, you'll get them.
5073620	5076980	It was a point in our harmontown team meeting where we were mad that you're selling more
5076980	5078980	mugs and we don't have any merchandise.

5106940	5107940	Yeah.
5107940	5112220	I mean, we shouldn't be so quick to fill his coffers before worrying about our bottom
5112220	5113220	line.

5150860	5152100	What?
5152100	5156780	It makes sense to the right people.

5162500	5165820	Black wooden stained wooden boards.
5165820	5170300	There's low lit like from candles that are on the walls.
5170300	5172460	There's a table and a couple chairs.
5172460	5173460	Yeah.
5173460	5177420	Diary is tied up against the wall and you see against the opposite wall Patches is tied
5177420	5178420	up.
5178420	5179420	He seems knocked out.
5179420	5183420	There's three people who upon you bursting in the room just leapt to their feet and are
5183420	5187340	scrambling for their weapons right now as we speak.
5187340	5189140	Where am I?

5201460	5203380	I thought I came on.
5203380	5204380	You can.

5207980	5208980	Okay.
5208980	5210660	I will arrive short.
5210660	5215060	Like in one turn or so but you'll burst in because you'll be catching up.
5215060	5216060	Okay.
5216140	5223380	How close is DJ how close are DJ and Patches to each other and how close to our foes here.
5223380	5233460	DJ is 20 feet from you Patches is about 10 feet from you and the enemies they're like
5233460	5234460	halfway.
5234460	5235460	They're closer.
5235460	5238500	They're kind of in the middle humans.
5238500	5241820	There's one or there's two humans in one arc.
5241820	5245540	I turn to what's your name Carlos.
5245540	5252940	I said Carlos why don't you open the bidding on this ass kicking.
5252940	5260180	Gentlemen I've been put in charge of opening the ass kicking.
5260180	5264820	I'm going to cast Summon Monster 2.
5264820	5265820	Yeah.
5265820	5266820	Okay.
5266820	5270540	And I've selected the monster that I'd like to summon.
5270540	5271540	All right.
5271540	5276540	Its name is Goblin Dog.
5276540	5277540	Sounds good.
5277540	5278540	That's my favorite.
5278540	5282060	I'm going to go Goblin some dope man.
5282060	5286300	Goblin Dogs no there's a built in like they're not going to attack my friends.
5286300	5292420	Your Summon Monsters tend to I think attack enemies.
5292420	5298380	Young girls may call him the Goblin Dog.
5298380	5302300	If you're just joining us and I think that's how people watch information these days.
5302300	5304660	They flip through channels on their laptop.
5304660	5307780	I've just summoned a Goblin Dog.
5307780	5308780	And it arrives presently.
5308780	5311780	His name is what?
5311780	5312780	Well I didn't name him.
5312780	5313780	Yeah.
5313780	5314780	It comes from a different plane.
5314780	5315780	He's going to be gone.
5315780	5316780	I mean I don't.
5316780	5318780	You don't want to get too close.
5318780	5319780	Rufus.
5319780	5320780	The Goblin Dog leaps into existence.
5320780	5327140	It has the frame of like a Marmaduke kind of dog but it's the shape and fashion of more
5327140	5328580	of a giant rat.
5328580	5329580	So it's like.
5329580	5330580	Greetings.

5354500	5360620	Well why not cut the jibber jabber and get to fighting.
5360620	5365460	I'm going to cut some of this jibber and jabber.
5365460	5374860	Let me put on my bib and my pull out my knife and fork and I'm going to go after these
5374860	5375860	baddies.

5386740	5388940	What do you do when you put on a bib and you pull out your knife and fork and lick
5388940	5389940	your lips?

5404940	5405940	No.
5405940	5406940	No.
5406940	5407940	That was a joke for Cody because I.
5407940	5408940	Do you think she's watching?
5408940	5409940	No.
5409940	5410940	She's probably.
5410940	5411940	She's got to be.
5411940	5413900	I love with someone else by now.
5413900	5414900	Okay.
5414900	5415900	Here I go.
5415900	5416900	Attack.
5416900	5418900	Attacking.
5418900	5419900	How do you do it?
5419900	5420900	Describe it.
5420900	5425380	Well, what I'm going to do is I have my, my knife, which is very sharp and my fork,
5425380	5430860	which has got four prongs in it and I'm going to just kind of stab and cut to two and bite
5430860	5435620	and you know, in between my dad, my chin with my bib.
5435620	5438260	That happens.
5438260	5442220	You hit one of the guys as he's going for a weapon and he takes five damage.
5442220	5443220	Yeah.
5443220	5444220	That's right.
5444220	5445220	A fork and knife.
5445220	5446220	Yeah.
5446220	5447220	Describe the damage.
5447220	5451580	Like I want to know how this government argues this fork fork and knife, like you'd use
5451580	5452580	a fork and knife.
5452580	5456420	There's little slices and what is the big conundrum here?
5456420	5457420	It's a fork and a knife.
5457420	5460100	You go, what are you going to do with that?
5460100	5461500	What do you put that?
5461500	5462500	Who is he?
5462500	5463500	Is he with you?
5463500	5464500	Could somebody blame?
5464500	5465500	He doesn't have hands.
5465500	5466500	He's a dog.
5466500	5467500	You don't know that.
5467500	5468900	You're up next.
5468900	5470540	I'm still tied up, right?
5470540	5473500	Yeah, but you can spend an action.
5473500	5478620	Oh, Chad, untie me.
5478620	5480660	I go over and untie DJ.
5480660	5484780	Oh, that's great because it's now your turn.
5484780	5485780	Do you have dexterity?
5485780	5486780	What's your dexterity?
5486780	5487780	Do I have dexterity?
5487780	5488780	Yes.
5488780	5489780	I do.
5489780	5492780	My dexterity is 16.
5492780	5498780	You're going to eat that, Mike, bro.
5498780	5500780	Yeah, bro.
5500780	5501780	16.
5501780	5502780	It doesn't.
5502780	5503780	It doesn't work.
5503780	5505780	It's it's tied really tight in the in the thick of battle.
5505780	5509260	You're telling me you can't untie this?
5509260	5511660	He's trying to avoid being hit and stuff too.
5511660	5512660	It's like you're dodging attacks.
5512660	5513660	All right.
5513660	5516260	Do I get like, do I loosen it a little bit?
5516260	5517260	Thanks for nothing.
5517260	5518260	Oh, yeah.
5518260	5519260	You loosen it.

5520260	5521260	Okay.
5521260	5522260	Okay.
5522260	5523260	It's bad guy's turn.
5523260	5527820	They finished scrambling to their weapons.
5527820	5531980	You can see one of them is like pulling on like a big robot puncher glove kind of thing,
5531980	5533580	like a big full body arm.
5533580	5538420	And the other guy has something that looks kind of like a like a handgun, just like a
5538420	5539780	modern day handgun.
5539780	5544100	And then the other guy grabs a sword and as he and he as he holds it aloft, it's like
5544100	5545100	whoa.
5545100	5546100	And it becomes fire sword.
5546100	5547100	Oh, shit.
5547100	5548100	Jeez.
5548100	5549860	I love fire.
5549860	5554780	And then they they form like a three man formation that looks like a fire sword to
5554780	5557540	chad the fire like her fight.
5557540	5564180	Can you over light his sword so that it's just burning his hand kind of like it?
5564180	5566340	Hang on.
5566340	5570340	Do I have a spell that I control fire, right?
5570340	5572500	To an extent, there's a spell you have control fire.
5572500	5574620	I think it's Dan's turn, though.
5574620	5579820	Gentlemen, there's no need for a quarrel between the church of the silver flame and the dragon
5579820	5585260	marked.
5585260	5588620	You certainly seem to think you know what you're talking about, but none of that means
5588620	5591620	anything to me.
5591620	5594700	Oh, ha ha.
5594700	5596940	What it's, you know, like this during combat.
5596940	5597940	Oh, right.
5597940	5598940	Yeah.
5598940	5601220	Well, I I was mostly thinking that stuff.
5601220	5602220	Oh, sorry.
5602220	5603220	No, no.
5603220	5609740	I mean, I thought I was going to I'm willing to I did want to take a shot at like just
5609740	5612140	communicating with them and you're saying it didn't work.
5612140	5613140	Yeah.
5613140	5614140	They were the incorrect.
5614140	5615140	So I kind of lose.
5615140	5616140	I don't get to also then go.
5616140	5617820	In that case, I'll smash their brains in.
5617820	5618820	Yeah.
5618820	5619820	No, you get free.
5619820	5620820	You get free talking.
5620820	5624180	Oh, is that like?
5624180	5625180	Host privilege?
5625180	5626180	No, it's within reason.
5626180	5627180	You can.
5627180	5630540	You couldn't like read a book, but you could like have a few because I'm like charging
5630540	5634540	my spirit hands and going gentlemen, you really don't.
5634540	5635540	Okay.
5635540	5637180	And now here's the thing.
5637180	5638180	Whoo.
5638620	5639900	Boy, oh boy.
5639900	5647460	I am going to I am going to cast divine favor on no.
5647460	5648460	You know what?
5648460	5649460	Wait, hold on a second.
5649460	5650460	I want to see if there's anything I can do to get here.
5650460	5651460	I'm out.
5651460	5652460	Let him talk.
5652460	5655300	Well, I just want to I just for a second there, I was like, wait, I should be focusing on
5655300	5656300	the diary.
5656300	5659020	I'm just saying because they saw you kind of shit fishing.
5659020	5661260	So I'm saying let them let the man on that.
5661260	5675620	I'm going to I'm going to cast I'm going to cast divine favor on Chad, which it just
5675620	5680900	gives him plus one for every three levels.
5680900	5682100	You've done it.
5682100	5687660	You touch him with your magic finger and it enhances him with God's might.
5687660	5688980	I just thought you're over there.
5688980	5689980	You're doing great.
5690300	5692740	Just want to support goblin dog signal boost.
5694140	5696180	OK, now it's my turn.
5696180	5701220	I grab the nearest one by the leg and chew on it like corn on the cob.
5703580	5704700	The same one you attacked.
5704700	5705900	Sorry, I didn't get the closest.
5705900	5707580	OK, let's say it's the same one.
5707580	5709020	All right, you miss.
5709020	5711620	You lunge is chewing on his leg.
5711620	5716700	You lunge at his leg as if to chew this to the air.
5716700	5718340	That makes no sense.
5718340	5722420	You find yourself chewing the leg of a table and or chair.
5722420	5723780	Is it really dark?
5723780	5726140	You can't tell because you're too close.
5726140	5731660	Too close to the table leg or chair or chair to know if it's a chick.
5731660	5735580	Have you ever tried to eat a guy's leg who didn't want his leg eaten as I did last week?
5735580	5736940	You know, no.
5736940	5737940	Oh, OK.
5739300	5740140	Because you wouldn't know.
5740140	5741140	Sorry.
5741140	5742100	So you chewed it.
5742100	5743900	You successfully chewed the last guys.
5743900	5746100	How did you know that he didn't want his leg chewed?
5746100	5748020	He said, ouch.
5748020	5751660	Spence, I want to use my knowledge of engineering to get myself out of these
5754940	5755860	rope ropes.
5755860	5757220	Do you have that as a skill?
5757220	5759300	Are there ranks by it?
5759300	5761100	It says total bonus six.
5761100	5766380	OK, you do it using your keen like Sherlock Holmes movie vision.
5766380	5773060	You you see the holes in the knots and stuff and you are able to to quickly shout
5773060	5776940	the instructions necessary to I shout them.
5776940	5782100	Well, if you wanted, you could tell Chad exactly how to do it, since you can't you can't move.
5782100	5783100	You know, oh.
5787900	5794100	Chad, you got to stick your thing in the loop here and then pull real hard and then go underneath
5794100	5801740	me and then lift me up on your shoulders and then drop me real fast and then pull the biggest
5801740	5804220	loop real hard like a yo-yo.
5804220	5805220	I do that.
5805220	5806220	All right.
5806220	5811300	He flips around like a yo-yo and is very quickly on his feet and untied, although you
5811300	5813580	don't have your stuff with you.
5813580	5815740	I don't have my stuff now.
5815740	5820380	You can take you can take some sort of action out because that was can I can I use charge
5820380	5823060	to get my stuff.
5823060	5824180	You don't know where your stuff is.
5824180	5826020	Oh, I don't know where it is.
5826020	5827020	Not offhand.
5827020	5828460	You kind of just regain consciousness recently.
5828460	5829460	All right.
5829460	5830460	I don't want to be a distraction.
5830460	5836420	So I'm just going to run in circles yelling eat my ass bastards and try to make them really
5836420	5837420	confused.
5837420	5843060	I'm not telling you not to do that, but you love that idea before you do that.
5843060	5852100	You get the sense that doing that will open you up to between three and seven attacks
5852100	5855100	by realizing the rules of the game.
5855100	5856100	That's how you know this stuff.
5856100	5858500	But those would all be people who would otherwise attack us.
5858500	5860460	Yeah, that's the that's the thinking.
5860460	5862300	But no, they're free attacks.
5862300	5867140	So it's you'd be taking free damage.
5867140	5870140	Three free free.
5870140	5872940	It wouldn't profit me at all if you did that.
5872940	5878580	You can try and be distracting, but like running near them in a circle, I think is well, the
5878580	5880500	most dangerous way to be distracting.
5880500	5881500	Okay.
5881500	5886660	Well, then I I look around the room while I yell eat my ass bastards.
5886660	5887660	Okay.
5887660	5892100	So you're just trying to be distracting without suicide.
5892100	5893860	It's not it's not very distracting.
5893860	5897460	They quickly clock that you're unarmed and just trying to be distracting.
5897460	5900340	And yeah, I'm sorry.
5900340	5901900	I need better dice.
5901900	5904780	But so did I die?
5904780	5907620	No, but your distraction is not distracting.
5907620	5910260	Oh, do I see where my stuff is?
5910260	5913060	No, you're just running around being distracting.
5913060	5914980	Okay, that's fine.
5914980	5920260	What's the success in my mind?
5920260	5927580	I can I cast a level one and a level two or just like just one two different turns?
5927580	5928580	Yeah.
5928580	5929580	Two different.
5929580	5930580	Okay.
5930580	5931580	Tree shape.
5931580	5932580	I turned into a tree.
5932580	5937900	But but there's there's a lead up to this, but there's going to write something else
5937900	5938900	that happens.
5938900	5942780	I just I become a tree that gives me plus 10 to my armor class.
5942780	5944180	Oh, yeah.
5944180	5945180	I'm a tree now.
5945180	5946180	Wow.
5946180	5947940	Are we like we're in the middle of a room?
5947940	5950500	Okay, I'm now a fucking tree in the middle of the room.
5950500	5956700	And I kind of like do I have facial features or am I just a full on tree?
5956700	5960500	You have two things that might look kind of like eyes.
5960500	5966900	Okay, I take one limb and kind of like give my team like this is going to pay off.
5966900	5967900	Yeah, but right now.
5967900	5968900	They instantly understand.
5968900	5973260	I'm banking on the fact that me turning into a tree in the middle of a combat is going
5973260	5977860	to fucking freak them out and put them off like put them on their back heel for a moment.
5977860	5978860	You bank on that.
5978860	5979860	Yeah.
5979860	5980860	You're a beautiful tree.
5980860	5981860	Thank you.
5981860	5983860	A shambling mount appears.
5983860	5987500	Hey, how are you doing?
5987500	5991340	Just coming through me and Gary.
5991340	5992340	That's me too.
5992340	6001980	I'm walking through the building and I'm seeing a tree and you and he and we're going to be
6001980	6002980	friends forever.
6002980	6003980	I'm here.
6003980	6007220	What's going on, guys?
6007220	6011860	The tide of the battle is turning.
6011860	6013020	I thought I just honked.
6013020	6014020	You fucking nailed that.
6014020	6015020	I'm a tree.
6015020	6016020	I can't talk.
6016020	6017020	I'm a tree.
6017020	6018020	How you doing?
6018020	6019020	Play it cool, Gary.
6019020	6020020	Hello.
6020020	6021020	How you doing?
6021020	6024020	Who's this dog creature?
6024020	6031540	Well, I was summoned to help out here.
6031540	6032540	Really?
6032540	6038300	You're a tree plus one on all of your defense and offense and you turned into a tree.
6038300	6042740	I have another spell.
6042740	6044860	Get through another round and just watch.
6044860	6045860	What?
6045860	6049980	Somebody explained to me what's been going on since I showed up.
6049980	6051420	I turned myself.
6051420	6052420	You turned into a tree.
6052420	6056940	Talk without moving your speech to take a turn.
6056940	6057940	What?
6057940	6061660	Like if you keep like this is this is a lot of speech like right.
6061660	6062660	Different combat.
6062660	6063660	So keep talking.
6063660	6065420	Well, I need to know what's going on.
6065420	6069780	Well, you can see that with your I can see what happened before I showed up.
6069780	6071660	No, what currently is happening.
6071660	6073020	But I don't know what's going on.
6073020	6074740	So you can see what's going on.
6074740	6079020	No, I'm telling you, you can see what's going on before I came here.
6079020	6080220	I could see what's going on.
6080220	6084820	You're currently here and you can currently see currently what's going on.
6084820	6085820	What's going on?
6085820	6086820	I'm a tree.
6086820	6087820	There's a fight.
6087820	6088820	Get the guys that you don't know.
6088820	6091460	Hit the people that you don't know who they are.
6091460	6096260	I grab the guy who's got the flaming sword and I grab him by the wrist and I shake it.
6096260	6099220	I go, what are you doing?
6099220	6100620	Put that down.
6100620	6102900	Put it down.
6102900	6103900	What are you doing?
6103900	6104900	All right.
6104900	6107500	What are you doing with that?
6107500	6108500	Put it down.
6108500	6109500	No, put it down.
6109500	6110500	What are you doing?
6110500	6111980	What are you doing with that?
6111980	6112980	Come on.
6112980	6113980	What are you doing with that?
6113980	6114980	We put a flaming.
6114980	6116980	We put it down.
6116980	6118380	All right.
6118380	6119380	You do that.
6119380	6122020	You get him and he slashes you with this flaming sword.
6122020	6124420	It deals 18 damage.
6124420	6126660	Even after I was saying all of that?
6126660	6127660	Yeah.
6127660	6132300	But then you grab him and then you grab him with your massive shambling arm and you crush
6132300	6133940	his wrist.
6133940	6138700	So now you're holding him by the wrist and you got him by his sword, hand, but in that
6138700	6140140	process you took damage.
6140140	6142500	How much health does shambling have?
6142500	6144980	That doesn't sound good.
6144980	6145980	No, no.
6145980	6146980	You have a lot.
6146980	6148580	That's what I was laughing about.
6148780	6152580	Did you tell him that I'm saying all this stuff that I'm shaking his hand and I'm saying
6152580	6155700	tell him that I'm saying, oh, I told him, what are you doing?
6155700	6156700	No, I told him, what are you doing?
6156700	6157700	You slash a baby.
6157700	6158700	What if I did that to you?
6158700	6159700	You wouldn't like it.
6159700	6160700	All right.
6160700	6161700	I wouldn't like it.
6161700	6162700	So keep acting like this.
6162700	6164820	I'm going to take your pants down from all these people.
6164820	6166100	Whose turn is it now?
6166100	6167100	It's my turn.
6167100	6168100	I'm going to give you a looking.
6168100	6169100	All right.
6169100	6173900	One of the guys, he, uh, he identifies the shambling mound as the biggest threat and
6173900	6178020	Hey, he, uh, he, this guy is known.
6178020	6179620	I'm known here.
6179620	6181460	This guy's the puncher guy.
6181460	6186460	He's the orc and, um, yeah, he, he tries to punch at you.
6186460	6191580	Oh, his, uh, he, he, he charges up his punch, right?
6191580	6195860	And it's like this big robot device and you can see it's all like worrying and steaming
6195860	6199380	and, and pistoning and it just explodes.
6199380	6200380	His best explain.
6200380	6201380	Yeah.
6201380	6202380	It just explodes.
6202380	6203380	Like a misfire.
6203380	6204380	Yeah.
6204380	6205700	So that was a critical fail on a robot.
6205700	6206700	Yeah.
6207380	6208380	Dude, he died.
6208380	6209380	Yeah.
6209380	6210380	Hell yeah.
6210380	6211380	What?
6211380	6212380	Through no fault of your own.
6212380	6216500	You scared him to explosion.
6216500	6217500	You see that?
6217500	6219900	You see what happens?
6219900	6221900	You see what happens?
6221900	6222900	Drop it.
6222900	6223900	All right.
6223900	6224900	The other guy shoot.
6224900	6229340	He, he points the gun at you guys and shoots it and it, it fires like it looks like a lightning
6229340	6230340	bolt.
6230340	6234420	If someone just cast lightning bolt and it just blasts through the room, it cuts through
6234420	6235500	the room.
6235500	6237300	It hits all four of you guys.
6237300	6239300	What caliber is that?
6239300	6240780	What caliber is that?
6240780	6242860	For how much damage spent four D six.
6242860	6243860	No, three D six.
6243860	6244860	We all get hit.
6244860	6245860	Yeah.
6245860	6246860	You all get hit.
6246860	6247860	I ducked.
6247860	6248860	Yep.
6248860	6254740	I can't, I can't remember my hit points.
6254740	6257380	Look at your sheet.
6257380	6261180	Well, I'm looking at it, but I can't remember how much damage I had had.
6261180	6263620	We all had healed before.
6263620	6264620	That's not true.
6264820	6266820	It's not true.
6266820	6269820	Remember I'm a tree right now with plus 10 to my armor class.
6269820	6270820	Oh, right.
6270820	6272820	And trees actually have lightning resistance.
6272820	6273820	Yeah.
6273820	6277860	I don't know if that's because we're got like resistance.
6277860	6278860	That might be true.
6278860	6282220	You guys are going to, you guys are going to be so proud of me when you find out why
6282220	6285780	I turned myself into a good pun at the end of this.
6285780	6291420	I mean, I honestly, I don't, I don't remember you having 14, but I could be wrong.
6291420	6292420	Okay.
6292420	6293420	I'll go with that.
6293420	6295500	So I now have five, five.
6295500	6296500	If I'm right.
6296500	6297500	Yeah.
6297500	6298500	That's right.
6298500	6299500	We took 11 damage.
6299500	6300500	No, he took nine damage.
6300500	6302500	You took 13 damage.
6302500	6303500	Wow.
6303500	6304500	You got hit harder.
6304500	6305500	I didn't get any.
6305500	6306500	I didn't take any.
6306500	6308020	No, I got to see if you're resistant.
6308020	6309020	I'm shambling.
6309020	6312540	I shambled out of the way of the lightning.
6312540	6314460	Oh yeah.
6314460	6315460	Yeah.
6315460	6316460	You're immune to electricity.
6316460	6317460	See?
6317460	6318460	Yeah.
6318460	6320460	And that's why you turn yourself into a tree.
6320460	6329180	I'm like swamping motherfucker, motherfucker, I'm like swamping, I'm immune to electricity
6329180	6333700	motherfucker, motherfucker, motherfucker, I'm immune.
6333700	6338220	Carlos, do you have a group healing spell?
6338220	6340220	Do you have, if you have channel energy, you do.
6340220	6341820	I have channel energy.
6341820	6342820	Tune into channel energy.
6342820	6343820	It wasn't what I was going to do next.
6343820	6344820	You don't have to.
6344820	6346220	And I don't even know.
6346220	6349820	Well, I mean, I'm, I'm, I think I'm close to death here.
6349820	6350820	Okay.
6350820	6351820	All right.
6351820	6352820	Fine.
6352820	6354060	Everyone within 30 feet gets a 2d6 heal.
6354060	6361740	If I channel energy, hey, no harm.
6361740	6362740	All right.
6362740	6366180	So Dan, you get back five and you two get back six, but you haven't taken damage, right?
6366180	6367180	No, because I'm a tree.
6367180	6368180	Right.
6368180	6369180	Yeah.
6369180	6370180	So that, but I took damage before, man.
6370180	6371180	Can I get some of that healing?
6371180	6372180	Yes.
6372180	6373180	You get six.
6373180	6374180	I get healed.
6374180	6375180	Six.
6375180	6376180	I get six healed.
6376180	6377180	Yeah.
6377180	6378180	So you keep a track of this because I don't have a pencil.
6378180	6379180	You're at 10 now.
6379540	6380540	You're not keeping track of it.
6380540	6381540	No.
6381540	6384020	I mean, I'm loosely keeping track of it.
6384020	6385020	Okay.
6385020	6389820	How much HP does Shambling have overall taken 12 damage at this point?
6389820	6390820	But what's his total?
6390820	6391820	What was his total?
6391820	6394820	How much am I giving?
6394820	6395820	Okay.
6395820	6396820	Sorry.
6396820	6397820	You go.
6397820	6398820	Oh, no.
6398820	6399820	Oh, what were you saying?
6399820	6400820	Well, no, I cast the chat channel energy.
6400820	6401820	Okay.
6401820	6402820	It's goblin dog last turn.
6402820	6403820	Do you want to have him do anything?
6403820	6404820	Yes.
6404820	6407820	Well, just attack the guy.
6407820	6409340	You're going to attack me?
6409340	6410340	What did I do?
6410340	6412820	It's his last attack before he goes away.
6412820	6416900	Well, and diarrhea Jr. has been freed of his tethers.
6416900	6417900	Yeah.
6417900	6418900	Okay.
6418900	6420900	And yeah, these aren't complicated creatures.
6420900	6423700	They're summoned and they attack and they don't attack.
6423700	6429660	So yeah, I have them attack the, like I said, can I change that to the weakest looking guy?
6429660	6430660	Yeah.
6430660	6433220	Which is, which is what, which one is it?
6433220	6434220	Which is the weakest?
6434220	6437180	Well, which is the weakest one?
6437180	6441900	And your goblin dog instinct kind of, aren't you able to kind of sense weakness?
6441900	6442900	Sure.
6442900	6446620	No, it's your choice then.
6446620	6447620	Okay.
6447620	6454340	I attack the guy with the lightning gun and I go up and I just, I just kind of chew on
6454340	6455340	his face.
6455340	6456340	All right.
6456340	6458340	Chew on his face a little.
6458340	6459820	You want to chew it?
6459820	6460820	I did already.
6460820	6461820	And?
6461820	6462820	Five damage.
6462820	6464100	You bite him right on the face.
6464100	6465420	You rip open his lip.
6465420	6466420	Ooh.
6466660	6467660	Good job.
6467660	6468660	Goblin dog.
6468660	6469660	Good job.
6469660	6470660	Goblin dog.
6470660	6471660	Ben Will.
6471660	6472660	Young goblin dog.
6472660	6473660	Yes.
6473660	6477660	Your name was Rufus.
6477660	6478660	Yep.
6478660	6479660	Thumbs up.
6479660	6485180	Go back to hell.
6485180	6486180	He disappears.
6486180	6487540	He returns to hell.
6487540	6489300	I really liked him.
6489300	6490660	I liked that guy.
6490660	6491980	All right.
6491980	6494860	It's Steve's turn.
6495780	6497700	I'm still a tree, right?
6497700	6498700	Yeah.
6498700	6499700	As far as I understand.
6499700	6500700	Yes.
6500700	6506700	Do any of you guys have a weapon that I could borrow for this attack?
6506700	6507900	Can a tree hand him a weapon?
6507900	6508900	No.
6508900	6509900	Your stuff is a tree.
6509900	6510900	I'm a tree.
6510900	6511900	Yeah.
6511900	6512900	You would have been able to.
6512900	6514900	Can I rip a branch off of?
6514900	6515900	Yeah.
6515900	6516900	Hey.
6516900	6517900	Hey.
6517900	6518900	Hey.
6518900	6519900	Hey.
6519900	6520900	I could give you something.
6520900	6521900	What do you got?
6521900	6522900	I didn't.
6522900	6523900	Zips.
6523940	6524940	Sorry.
6524940	6526780	I didn't describe this this time.
6526780	6528980	I described it last time, but I forgot to.
6528980	6529980	Yeah.
6529980	6534020	There's there's a target like it's like a throwing knife target on the wall.
6534020	6535700	That's like full of throwing knives.
6535700	6540420	Oh, oh, that's I mean, okay, great.
6540420	6543980	Can I dart to the target?
6543980	6544980	You're already near it.
6544980	6549660	Oh, can I pull out careful three throwing knives?
6549660	6550660	Are they heavy?
6550660	6551660	Yeah.
6551660	6552660	They're really light.
6552700	6563580	I'll pull out a couple of those and I want to throw them at the the fire swords chest.
6563580	6565060	Okay.
6565060	6568780	His hand is being grabbed so he can't dodge as well.
6568780	6569780	Yeah.
6569780	6571300	But you're not proficient.
6571300	6572300	What's your dexterity?
6572300	6574460	Oh, God.
6574460	6576460	It's 15 plus two.
6576460	6577460	Yeah.
6577460	6578740	No, you miss.
6578740	6580940	It whizzes by his head.
6580940	6581940	Hey.
6582580	6583580	What are you doing?
6583580	6584580	I'm sorry.
6584580	6587340	I thought I'd be able to hit him while you were holding him still.
6587340	6589340	It's Jeff's turn.
6589340	6590340	Entangle.
6590340	6595220	Oh, that was his big thing.
6595220	6599020	I use my can I be my own entanglement devices now that I'm a tree.
6599020	6600020	I got to look it up.
6600020	6606140	But let's just say yes for now because I now can use Woodland Creek, Woodland, the branches
6606140	6611220	and vines to entangle plants.
6611220	6612620	Everyone in 40 foot radius.
6612620	6613620	All right.
6613620	6614980	I just try to entangle.
6614980	6615980	So do we get entangled?
6615980	6618420	Also, I'm aiming at the bad guys.
6618420	6622180	That's the thing is I feel like I'm going to have to look this up because I think you
6622180	6623980	might just follow your heart.
6623980	6627340	I'm going to just say for now that it's just fine.
6627340	6628340	Okay.
6628340	6631140	And but I think everyone technically might be entangled, but let's not worry.
6631140	6632140	Everyone.
6632140	6633140	Okay.
6633140	6634140	Well, okay.
6634140	6635140	I find tangle everybody.
6635140	6636140	It's Willy Nilly.
6636140	6638020	I have no control over who I entangle.
6638020	6640500	Well, it's area based and we're in a small confine.
6640500	6641500	But I don't know.
6641500	6642780	Let's just say I had big plans.
6642780	6643780	I know.
6643780	6647340	Let's just say for now because I'm not sure and I don't want to look it up because yeah,
6647340	6651940	I mean, let's just say you look at it and tangle everybody because we can talk it out.
6651940	6653780	Yeah, we can talk this shit out.
6653780	6658860	I want to be in that that long I entangle the whole I entangle everything in a 40 foot
6658860	6661940	radius and I'm just a big I'm just a big entangler.
6661940	6662940	Right.
6662940	6665660	It's not it's not like chains or anything.
6665660	6666780	It just makes it harder.
6666780	6668780	It's like it's like fighting through a maze.
6668780	6669780	Okay.
6669780	6670780	So I haven't changed.
6670780	6671780	Well, you have.
6671780	6674060	Yeah, they're definitely they're definitely currently bound.
6674060	6677300	They're just not they're not I was going to just tangle fuckers up.
6677300	6678300	Well, what happens?
6678300	6679300	What happens?
6679300	6680300	There's a fire sword in the mix.
6680300	6681300	Is it?
6681300	6682300	Well, it's being held.
6682300	6683300	Yeah.
6683300	6685540	Oh, I got it.
6685540	6686540	Taking care of.
6686540	6687540	Yeah.
6687540	6688540	All right.
6688980	6689980	Fuck it.
6689980	6692140	I I'm new at this.
6692140	6694420	I'm a druid that hasn't really figured this shit out.
6694420	6696180	I just start entangling parkers.
6696180	6698740	Now everyone's caught in my web of entanglements.
6698740	6699740	Yep.
6699740	6707340	And I hold his flaming sword up high away from the the the the the tangles so they don't
6707340	6708340	catch fire.
6708340	6709340	Right.
6709340	6712060	Yes, they don't catch fire if it's held up high.
6712060	6713060	That works.
6713060	6714060	Yeah.
6714060	6716220	And I'm still shaking it and I'm telling him to what is he doing?
6716220	6717540	What are you doing?
6717540	6718540	Don't do that.
6719540	6722140	You're welcome, Chad.
6722140	6723140	Is that your whole turn?
6723140	6724540	Do you want to do other stuff?
6726540	6727540	Is it my turn?
6727540	6728540	Yeah.
6728540	6730540	Oh, I start kicking him.
6732540	6735540	Kicking him in like his shins.
6735540	6736540	All right.
6736540	6737540	I'm going.
6737540	6738540	You big man?
6738540	6740540	You big man now?
6740540	6741540	You big man?
6742540	6743540	Does he answer?
6743540	6746540	How's Patchen's doing?
6746540	6747540	Patchen's is unconscious.
6747540	6750540	Oh, does he say he's probably entangled.
6750540	6752540	He says, ow.
6752540	6753540	Yeah.
6753540	6754540	Yeah.
6754540	6755540	You hit him for 16 damage.
6755540	6758540	You kick the fuck out of his shins.
6758540	6759540	Yeah.
6759540	6761540	I'm kicking him in the shin and ass.
6761540	6762540	Yeah.
6762540	6763540	And I go, you stupid mother.
6763540	6765540	That hurts more than the lightning.
6765540	6766540	I don't know.
6766540	6767540	Wow.
6767540	6769540	You break his knees.
6769540	6770540	Yeah.
6770540	6771540	Yeah.
6771540	6772540	You don't want him.
6772540	6774540	You don't want to get a shambling kick.
6774540	6775540	Who's up?
6775540	6777540	It's like Edward Norton, American History X.
6780540	6784540	So the guy with broken knees tries to break free, and he does.
6784540	6792540	He falls to the ground just trying to slice with his flaming sword.
6792540	6795540	And he hits the tree.
6795540	6797540	And so he's going to catch it on fire.
6797540	6798540	Oh, come on.
6798540	6800540	I love fire.
6800540	6801540	Oh.
6801540	6803540	I hope you love being on it.
6805540	6808540	My name is the fire Laker.
6808540	6810540	All right.
6810540	6813540	You take 13 fire damage bullshit.
6813540	6814540	All right.
6814540	6815540	He does that.
6815540	6817540	The other guy, he's got the Zapcaster.
6817540	6819540	Well, you don't know that that's what it's called.
6819540	6821540	That's really its name.
6821540	6822540	Zapcaster.
6822540	6823540	It's a working title.
6823540	6827540	But yeah, most of the stuff is behind the scenes terminology because it
6827540	6828540	doesn't come up.
6828540	6832540	But yeah, he can't he can't pull himself free from the entanglement to
6832540	6834540	shoot anybody with his gun.
6835540	6838540	Because I'm a tree is fire damage over time.
6838540	6841540	Uh, yeah, well, it'll it'll keep burning.
6841540	6842540	Yeah, I keep burning.
6842540	6843540	Let's put out.
6843540	6845540	So now it's Dan's turn.
6845540	6846540	So one person's dead.
6846540	6849540	One person is very crippled and on the floor.
6849540	6852540	They only kind of managed to catch something on fire while they were
6852540	6854540	falling out of the grasp of a monster.
6854540	6857540	And then the guy, the other guy is entangled.
6857540	6859540	Oh, you're entangled kind of.
6859540	6860540	Okay.
6860540	6861540	Well,
6864540	6868540	is there anyone within attack range of me mealy wise?
6869540	6872540	Uh, no, you've been kind of out of the fray, I think.
6872540	6873540	All right.
6873540	6880540	Well, then I'm just gonna do a good old solar flare.
6880540	6884540	Oh, blinding everyone in the room.
6884540	6886540	Can you do that more than once a day?
6886540	6887540	Did I already do it today?
6887540	6888540	You did it once today.
6888540	6889540	Yeah.
6889540	6891540	Because I did it in the bathroom.
6891540	6893540	Yeah, that was the same day.
6893540	6895540	I mean, I said I was doing a solar flare.
6895540	6899540	It was the expression of how the tacos were hitting me.
6899540	6901540	You might be able to do more than once per day.
6901540	6904540	No, it says once per day.
6904540	6907540	No, it doesn't say that, but it doesn't say more than once.
6907540	6908540	Um, okay.
6908540	6910540	Well, try this on for size.
6910540	6911540	How do you like this?
6913540	6916540	Here's something I can do more than once a day.
6917540	6918540	Yeah.
6918540	6921540	Energy and heal everybody within 30 feet.
6922540	6923540	That's what I do.
6923540	6924540	I'm a healer.
6925540	6927540	It's not a good ending, but...
6927540	6929540	Do I grow bigger?
6930540	6931540	No, but you heal.
6931540	6932540	I'm already healed.
6932540	6934540	You heal three.
6934540	6936540	Steve heals six.
6936540	6938540	Jeff heals four.
6938540	6939540	Dan heals six.
6939540	6940540	Not writing this down.
6940540	6941540	It's fine.
6941540	6942540	Steve's writing it down.
6943540	6945540	Or if he's not, it's fine.
6945540	6946540	No, I'm writing it down.
6947540	6948540	Um, yeah.
6948540	6950540	So everyone is healed for that amount.
6950540	6952540	So we got this one guy that's crippled.
6953540	6954540	People are still entangled.
6954540	6956540	How many rounds are they entangled for?
6959540	6960540	At least two more.
6962540	6963540	Uh, Steve.
6964540	6965540	I mean, can I move at all?
6965540	6966540	What's my...
6968540	6969540	You're being entangled.
6969540	6971540	So you can try to move, but you might fail.
6971540	6972540	Okay.
6972540	6979540	Is it sort of, would you say like all the vines and stuff were sort of like its own dungeon?
6981540	6982540	Sure.
6982540	6986540	Could I use my knowledge of dungeneering and maneuver through the...
6986540	6987540	Oh, Steve.
6988540	6989540	Wow.
6989540	6990540	You can try.
6992540	6993540	It's not a word game.
6994540	6996540	It's a game of the imagination.
6997540	6999540	You don't gain meaningful insight from the vines.
6999540	7001540	Because they're not a dungeon at all.
7002540	7004540	Or because you can't connect them to a dungeon.
7005540	7007540	Because they're vines.
7008540	7011540	Well, maybe there's like a dungeon of the vines, but he's just never been there to connect.
7011540	7013540	A dungeon of the vines.
7013540	7014540	There is one.
7014540	7015540	I'm saying it now.
7016540	7019540	The bad guy's like, have you guys heard of the dungeon of the vines?
7019540	7020540	Oh my God.
7020540	7021540	Oh, damn.
7022540	7023540	Wow.
7023540	7024540	So is my turnover or can I...
7024540	7025540	No, you just don't know.
7026540	7027540	All right.
7027540	7036540	So then I do my best to get to the closest enemy and I'll just keep punching them if I make it.
7037540	7038540	Okay.
7038540	7039540	You do that.
7039540	7040540	Hell yeah.
7040540	7041540	So you're punching...
7041540	7042540	Which guy?
7042540	7043540	Whoever's closest.
7043540	7044540	Who's the guy?
7044540	7045540	Yeah, the crippled guy's closest.
7046540	7052540	Yeah, just keep punching him while he's down until his face is all bloody and his bones start cracking.
7052540	7054540	What's your strength bonus?
7055540	7056540	18 plus four.
7056540	7057540	That's a lot of...
7057540	7059540	You hit him for five damage.
7059540	7060540	Fuck yeah.
7060540	7061540	All right.
7061540	7062540	You knock him out.
7062540	7063540	Eat my shit, you bitch.
7068540	7069540	That could be.
7069540	7070540	Yeah.
7070540	7071540	Moment passed.
7071540	7072540	Who's turn?
7072540	7073540	Jeff's turn.
7073540	7075540	Can I do a fireball as a tree or am I just a tree?
7075540	7078540	No, you got to come back from a tree to not entangle.
7078540	7081540	Is that one turn?
7081540	7082540	Let's see.
7082540	7083540	You can do it as a free action.
7083540	7084540	Okay.
7084540	7088540	I untree and I shoot firebolt at crippled guy.
7088540	7089540	Okay.
7089540	7090540	Wait.
7090540	7091540	He just got knocked out.
7091540	7092540	Oh yeah.
7092540	7093540	I'm fucking...
7093540	7094540	I'm going to kill him.
7094540	7095540	Okay.
7096540	7097540	You missed.
7097540	7099540	Jesus Christ.
7099540	7100540	Sorry, guys.
7100540	7102540	I've been a tree for the last 10 minutes.
7102540	7103540	Yeah.
7103540	7104540	Sampling mount.
7104540	7109540	I run up to the crippled guy that's unconscious.
7109540	7112540	I start stomping on him like DeNiro and Goodfellas.
7112540	7113540	Okay.
7113540	7117540	When he's stomping on the shinebox guy.
7117540	7120540	So the camera's like looking up.
7120540	7122540	Up at me and I'm going.
7122540	7123540	It's gross.
7123540	7125540	It makes you uncomfortable.
7125540	7127540	A lot of people make that mistake.
7127540	7130540	That character's name isn't the shinebox guy.
7130540	7131540	He's dead.
7136540	7137540	He's dead.
7138540	7140540	Gary, you killed him.
7143540	7149540	Thank you, Lord Jesus.
7149540	7150540	Thank you.
7150540	7152540	Thank you, Jesus Christ in heaven.
7152540	7153540	Thank you.
7153540	7154540	Thank you, Saint Peter.
7154540	7156540	What are these people he's talking about?
7156540	7157540	Thank you, Jesus.
7157540	7158540	I don't...
7160540	7161540	What was that?
7161540	7163540	To the finger!
7163540	7164540	Oh my God.
7164540	7165540	Oh my God.
7165540	7166540	Oh my God.
7166540	7172540	The most fitting ending to an episode ever.
7172540	7174540	Let's give it up for Steve Lee to everybody.
7174540	7175540	That's the best episode.
7175540	7177540	The most fitting ending.
7180540	7181540	Rob.
7181540	7182540	Rob?
7182540	7183540	Man.
7183540	7185540	He just ended an episode in silence.
7185540	7186540	Yeah.
7186540	7188540	Not even mid, like...
7188540	7190540	The credits weren't even rolling.
7190540	7192540	It was just kind of like...
7192540	7193540	Should we cut?
7193540	7194540	Should we cut?
7194540	7195540	Okay.
7195540	7196540	Yeah, well, guess what?
7196540	7198540	Let's give it up for everybody that helps out Nick.
7198540	7199540	This is awesome.
7199540	7203540	You sang Sarah, Kevin, Chris, Zach, Church.
7205540	7206540	Tim Morge is here somewhere.
7206540	7207540	Wasn't Tim Morge supposed to be in the show?
7207540	7208540	Is he just hanging out?
7208540	7210540	Meow, meow, meow, meow.
7210540	7211540	Have I ever got anybody?
7211540	7214540	Oh, it's the best of quitting in the game, master.
7214540	7215540	Meow, meow.
7215540	7217540	I'm your controller, Mr. Jeff Davis.
7217540	7219540	To mayor's Dan Harmon.
7219540	7222540	Try fast, take chances.
7229540	7240540	Did you get any of that?
7240540	7243540	It's a good show.
