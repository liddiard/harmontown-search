0	3500	All you want to be is a shavily bubbly gobbly coop
7000	8000	Alright
11000	14000	Barman Count is now in session
16500	19500	I am your guest, Tom Solar, Ryan Ridley
22500	29000	Coming to the stage, your Game Master, Spencer Crichton-Diggerton
30000	40000	And now, the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman
45000	46000	Thank you
50000	52000	It's like some haunted mansion music
52000	53000	What's that?
53000	54000	Haunted mansion music
54000	55000	Oh, that's what it sounded like to me
55000	56000	Scary
56000	60000	So it's like the Halloween equivalent of turkey sandwiches
60000	65000	We're just using up a couple extra scary things
69000	72000	Like, you know, ghosts, they have unfinished business
76000	79000	Alright, well, I'm not going to lie to you guys, it's going to be a bad show tonight
79000	82000	We already discussed it beforehand
82000	87000	I'll just run through, okay, like the things that I wrote in Microsoft OneNote
87000	88000	Because fuck you, Evernote
88000	91000	Yay, it's a good app
93000	95000	That's the guy that introduced me to it
96000	100000	Alright, so my therapist thinks that my book, she keeps mentioning my bug bites
102000	105000	I trusted her before that
105000	108000	Because I thought she was like a scientist of the mind
108000	113000	But then she was like, she's like, what's going on with your arms?
113000	118000	And I was like, I have these, if a flea bites me or a mosquito or anything like that
118000	120000	Like, the bite is there forever
120000	124000	That's one of the many reasons why I'm better off in LA
124000	128000	You know, like in Milwaukee where there's mosquitoes like for a month of the year
128000	133000	Like, I would just be covered in, I don't know, I'd probably have some allergy or something
133000	136000	Like, I don't think it's psychosomatic
136000	137000	I don't think it's like a
137000	139000	Oh, she was suggesting that you manifested these?
139000	144000	She was kind of implying that it was like, that it was a symptom of my unresolved wounds
144000	145000	Whoa, really?
145000	147000	Like, you and my chiropractor?
149000	150000	But I trusted her
150000	153000	Like, the chiropractor I get, because he's like not a real doctor
153000	159000	So he's just like, oh, and then the first time I ever took off my shirt in front of my chiropractor so he could scan me
159000	163000	He's like, oh, you have these open wounds on your back
163000	165000	I'm like, it's acne
165000	171000	Have you ever seen a person that ever ate anything besides kale?
173000	176000	It made me feel like I was like, oh, he must like, ew
176000	182000	And he's always pointing out, if I have lint when I pull out my stuff before I lay on the table
182000	185000	He'll be like, you should get a money clip or something if the money's loose
185000	187000	I'm like, Jesus Christ, this guy doesn't hate me
187000	192000	Like, he just looks at me like a big giant mess
192000	197000	Yeah, just a pile of fucking matchsticks he has to count and sort
197000	202000	You've opened wounds, open what, don't say that, open sores or something
202000	205000	It's zits, just stop bullying me
205000	210000	But you're saying your therapist really thought you've just psychologically made spider bites appear?
210000	214000	I don't even know, like in that Cronenberg movie from the 80s?
214000	215000	The brood?
215000	217000	No, not night breed
217000	218000	Night breed
218000	221000	That was Clive Barker for God's sakes, Cronenberg was in it
221000	225000	That guy loves Cronenberg so much he considers night breeding a Cronenberg movie
225000	229000	Because Cronenberg was in it as button face
229000	233000	No, I have like, if you can see with the camera
233000	240000	I probably got bit by, I think my dogs didn't take their flea meds during the divorce for a week
240000	245000	So then there was probably a flea in the bed, they love me, and then I got a couple of these bites
245000	251000	Like, this is like a, no, no, I mean, anyways, I'm just saying like, I don't trust my therapist anymore
251000	253000	Because she was like, oh, what are those things in your arms?
253000	256000	I'm like, we already talked about this, you focus on these things
256000	258000	It's like, what is this, like a cold read technique?
258000	263000	Or you just like pick up on whatever's weird, you know, if the person runs their hands through their hair
263000	265000	And you go like, what are you touching your hair?
265000	267000	And then like, and then they try to bring it back around
267000	269000	Like, you just kill time for 15 minutes and then you go
269000	272000	So it's like touching hair
272000	275000	And then the person's supposed to go, wow, and leave
275000	281000	My therapist told me today that there's a California law that you have to ask women if it's okay to have sex beforehand
281000	286000	Apropos of nothing, she just brought it up, so that made me a little, a little nervous
291000	294000	And you don't believe her, or?
294000	296000	I just wanted more information
297000	299000	You want more information?
300000	302000	Your therapist, can we talk about your therapist?
302000	303000	Sure
303000	304000	Is it okay?
304000	305000	I guess so
305000	309000	Because you said, because Ryan started going to his current therapist, same situation as me
309000	313000	You started going to a therapist that you met as a couples therapist
313000	316000	And now the relationship is over, but you're still seeing this person
316000	322000	With one notable catch, which is that you were going to, can I talk about that?
322000	324000	I don't know, but I'm not gonna stop you
325000	335000	Okay, alright, well you said that she's like, you went to her because she is open to the concept of polyamorousness
335000	340000	I mean, I don't know if that's why we went, but you know, it happened to be her specialty, yeah
340000	344000	Alright, so, but now, but then the couple broke up
344000	349000	And then now he's just seeing a lady about his own brain working
349000	353000	But every once in a while she brings up the, she's like, well, you know, as a polyamorous person
353000	359000	You know, as a polyamorous therapist, I think you should work out your strategy
359000	361000	And you're like, wait, oh, yeah, that's right
361000	363000	I came to you because you've
363000	365000	She's definitely never gonna judge me
365000	367000	I mean, you know what I mean? There's no boundaries there
367000	370000	Right, if she was like, I think you played too many video games
370000	372000	She'd be like, why don't you fuck everybody?
373000	375000	Regardless of whatever the situation is
376000	377000	Crazy lady
378000	382000	But yeah, I don't know that but it's like like what I don't I mean, come on, you know
382000	390000	What is she saying that my immune system is weakened because of my wounds from childhood or something like that?
390000	393000	Like you're doing her work for her, it sounds like
393000	399000	Well, no, she's trying to I mean, she went down this road and I was like, I just wanted to I was just like, man, come on
399000	403000	I had a friend who he when he would be really stressed
403000	405000	He would have a weird reaction to his detergent
406000	412000	And when he wasn't stressed, he wouldn't so he would switch detergents depending on how how rough of a time in his life
414000	416000	All right, so there's a
416000	419000	Because it because he really loved that guy loved that detergent
419000	420000	Yeah
420000	422000	Well, no, he hated the other one
423000	425000	Because apparently the stuff he was alert
425000	427000	But he didn't hate it enough to stress him out
427000	434000	Because otherwise that would well see the Mobius strip there. I I don't I'm sure it's there
434000	438000	Okay, I don't see it. Well, trust me. It's there or I'm drunk
439000	444000	I just I don't know. I guess I'm saying like I really like my therapist and I just don't want her to believe in this
444000	446000	It's okay. So
446000	452000	You know, I don't know like like like there was that time when she kind of implied that she kind of a little bit believed in ghosts
454000	456000	Because we were talking about our friend that passed away
457000	459000	And
459000	466000	I felt like I could see him on like I could sense him on set on the community set and like like crack and wise and
466000	473000	Stuff and that and she and she like she was like and I was like, I guess that's the denial part of coping with
473000	478000	The grief, you know, whatever and she's like, well, you know, there's that but there's also just the fact ectoplasm
478000	482200	She proceeded to just like launch into this thing. It was just like oh or maybe his spirit like
483200	488640	Floated down from parts and wreck to watch me shoot community because even because he came back
488640	492260	I was like, well, there's no floor or I'm a ghost and like landed down at community
494600	499440	That makes much more sense than just I was fucked up a little bit about the concept of death
500040	503480	All right. So anyways bug bites, whatever I guess I have gross bug bites
503480	506520	I guess I guess that's the guess that's what she was that's what I really got from it
506520	509960	It's like even my therapist who's supposed to like kind of accept me and want me to be happy
509960	513640	She's like, yeah, but I wish this fucking gross bites weren't on your arm
513640	518200	I'm just gonna start wearing turtlenecks and like like like like like like really tight like cuffs
518200	523480	like I just like like like a mom and shots performer and just why not her flaws, bro, yeah, exactly like
524160	529880	Like like like like you don't see me just like like like like talking talk looking at you and recognizing your face
532080	535840	All right, just would just really briefly the 3d touch on the phone I just don't get it
535840	538400	It's like now you can touch your phone too hard. I don't get it. I don't get it
538400	542400	I don't understand you keep you keep pressing things and now it's like it's like you can't you if you press too hard
542400	545800	It doesn't do anything and then you have to like press it. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to press you too hard
545800	550660	It's fucking stupid and I there's a setting for the you just pick a setting and there shouldn't have to be a setting
551840	553840	Shut up
553920	557960	So, oh is Apple now in the business of like oh the settings
557960	563320	No, that's called something other than Apple the whole appeal of this thing is that it comes out of the box and it works
563720	567760	Fuck you. Don't even tell who loses you if you would you you're complaining for nothing
567760	570480	All you got to do is what read the instructions?
571000	573480	Or or or or go into the menus
573480	579520	How about put two buttons instead of one then if we're gonna get all into the hands-on customization thing?
579520	581600	Let's go this guy watch two buttons on his phone
582800	584400	me too
584400	586440	Just may call it an iPhone Pro
587320	589320	Two buttons maybe
589320	593760	Imagine twice as much you could do instead of it's like you didn't touch it too hard a chiropractor
593760	595760	I talked I made up with my chiropractor
596040	601400	But the jury's still out now. I now I'm worried about my therapist. I'm alone in the world. I start it's I start
601960	604840	Cut to the chase. I bought two mannequins. Yeah
608080	614940	Two I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna be different and I'm probably gonna I'm probably gonna get a real doll. Yeah again
615740	620780	Don't don't groan because here's the thing. Here's the thing about you groaning. It makes you bad people and
621940	624340	Here's why because think about it
624860	631100	if you're 42 years old and you've never had a relationship that lasted longer than two years and
631380	637420	You just finished your first and last marriage that didn't even make it as long as you usually dated
638460	643380	That like are you a good person if you keep dating at that point like a
643980	648420	442 no, you're you ladies that are saying they're just hot for me. You just want
650820	654320	Or you oh, that's Justin's assistant
656580	661360	She just wants me to be busy so she doesn't have to bring me drinks at comic-con
663180	668420	No, I'm sorry. No, I'm really Sarah like like like like like that's it's the it's the search commercial in you
668420	675620	That's like. Yes. It's like healthy to it's healthy to do what to subject yourself and other people to your emotional incompatibility
675980	680580	Isn't that the story of frozen? Isn't the one sister like I haven't seen it, but isn't that?
681420	684860	Yeah, and except for the part where she's not supposed to be frozen
684860	688300	You know because they had to tell a story so it's like oh she gets unfrozen in the end, right?
688300	690620	like she's not was frozen as much but it's like
691700	695900	what if I'm just at the part like if if if this were frozen then my
696580	698260	sequined split
698540	700540	mid-sized gown
700580	702580	that I made out of ice power
703060	705820	When I sing the song, what's the song? I gotta be
710020	715780	Frozen inside I'm so in love with everything except for other people
716340	718340	I gotta be me
718620	724660	Every snowflake has a different shape and every human evolved from an ape
728500	730500	Frozen Stephanie
732740	734840	Yeah, you guys are right you're right to applaud
736780	738780	You did it
739700	746980	But if so, so why is it so hard to imagine me after a divorce going I'm gonna order a
747700	749700	$6,000 sex doll
750700	752700	Cuz I got a
752860	754860	nylon fetish and
755060	762260	And I when I see people all I see is their hair and their clothes and I don't want to subject anyone ever to that
762260	763140	again
763140	765140	so I
765140	768540	Spent six grand on a fuck doll. I just
771180	777580	One episode of Knight Rider just I just have it sitting around approving of me playing minecraft
779300	783460	Wouldn't that be if it's what's missing from that Jonah Hill like like
783580	784940	you
784940	791180	Want my cat to talk in order to make that adorable because believe me it is empowering it is important
791180	797740	like I think what I'm doing is heroic is saying like I don't want to I just want to I'm just gonna tenderly kiss the
797740	800420	Ankle of of a dead thing and
801500	807380	Then and then jerk off it takes five minutes out of like a day and then I'm off the market
807380	810740	I'm off the I'm then I'm back out here and I'm helping you
811500	816660	I'm not hurting you works for me. Yeah, I mean that you're doing it
816660	820420	I would never want to do that. That sounds like a horrible Twilight Zone nightmare
820820	826180	So never at 42 to hang up your hat from love
826180	829900	Oh, you don't mean the doll part. Well that doll parts horrible, too
831420	835580	But I think the funniest part is you have to ask for approval from your accountant, right? Yeah
836220	842140	That's true cuz yeah, yeah, I have like all his financial people so I have to like they're gonna notice a charge
844220	850420	No, it's okay guys. Yeah, I get to sell them on why you want to spend the money, right? Like he's gonna ask
851420	859380	Money, but I have to explain to them. It's not fraud. Yeah, not financial fraud. It's it's it's emotional and spiritual fraud
859380	865540	Certainly, there's definitely a heist going on of the soul
866340	868340	but but but but and
868700	873260	definitely a crime being committed for whichever guys have to haul the call the crate up the
874260	882460	Up the mountain to my palatial estate where it where Beth boots and now with unobstructed by eucalyptus trees can watch my
883740	888500	My sweaty head bob up and down is Beth boots in your neighbor. Thanks for the muffins
890380	896820	Yeah, Beth is the this guy doesn't like the podcast. I don't I mean Beth boots and is like a regular
898260	900940	Reference well lately. I
902140	905620	Mean whatever. Oh, let's all think Ryan Ridley. I guess for a comptroller
908300	910300	You guess
910860	917100	It was just my joke. My joke is that I mean to people that's my joke. It's not just me. No, no, it's everybody
917100	920940	I'm always I'm always cranky and mean that's my bit. All right, which makes me a great person
921940	924980	It doesn't well, it's good to be here. You're a great guy
925620	931580	Thankful to have you in my life. Good job Spencer. Thank you. Thanks driving me to work every day. It's important. Thank you for

942020	947320	Like so that's a big Spencer look them in the eye when he says this to you. I look them right in the stomach
949100	955140	That's why that's why we're that's why we made faster friends cuz we go yeah, I need too much eye contact
955140	957140	Oh, you need a lot. Yeah
958460	960460	God forbid
960620	962980	All right. Well, you know
964060	968540	Our our next guest is is a real doll
972220	974220	Oh
978980	980980	Her lifelessness
981940	986740	Is also a part of her charm and as best worth a lot more than six thousand. Oh, yeah
987060	991900	No, I've I've we got to work with her when we did our Harman quest
991900	998260	Which is a fantasy come true that the show itself and also getting a chance to to to to work with her
998340	1002180	I'm sure you guys are big fans and she was great on the show and
1002500	1009180	When we took the opportunity to cajole her into appearing on the podcast. Why don't we bring out our new friend Aubrey Plaza?
1009180	1028380	Yeah, and if you want to drink later I can make you when there's tongs, thank you
1030100	1033460	All right, so I know your stick isn't exuberance
1034260	1040060	And I and mine is bad interviewing my stick. Well, I mean, I don't mean to imply you have a stick
1040740	1042380	but
1042380	1045500	And I didn't I said your stick isn't exuberance
1046540	1048540	And I'm a bad interviewer
1049860	1052100	So I'm gonna push through and
1052980	1059100	It's all on me if it's a terrible show because it's I'm bad at what I do. Yeah. Yeah
1060100	1064100	Uh, what do you feel about sex dolls?
1066780	1068780	Um, I
1070380	1072380	Don't know I
1075340	1080980	Just did a movie about a sex robot that's like a sex doll. Yeah
1082620	1084620	And
1084860	1092460	You know, I think they're fucking weird and I think they're creepy and
1093540	1095540	They make me sad
1096020	1099020	The the men that use them make you sad too
1099020	1105060	No, it's just like the idea of it not the not the not anyone specifically just like I don't know
1105060	1108460	Like don't you think if a person was like, okay
1108900	1110140	like
1110220	1113740	20 strikes and like like every time you go out there
1113740	1119060	don't you think it's a little selfish of us to continually thrust ourselves out there out of loneliness and couple up and
1119140	1122420	then like if we keep on learning over and over again that like
1122660	1130020	Like the same result keeps happening like like statistically, isn't it? Isn't it to me? There's something like
1131260	1137780	Everyone should should just go fuck a doll. Yeah. Well, well, like what about recycling like like like
1138180	1142500	We we used to just throw everything in the garbage and we'd be like
1142500	1146980	Oh, then it all goes in the garbage and then someone was like, hey all that garbage didn't go anywhere
1146980	1152300	It's like a big island in the middle of the ocean and it's like there's seagulls like like like that are that are that are
1152460	1158920	Affected by it or whatever the fuck they said and and now we have two cans in all of our homes and it just become
1159540	1164060	Custom like somebody has an aluminum can and they come up to you and they find you at your party and they go
1164060	1166860	I can't find your recycling bin and you're like, okay
1166860	1168860	I wrote it asshole. I'll deal with it
1169300	1174500	Like like like culture changed, you know, like and sexually like aren't we throwing away?
1175140	1176420	our
1176420	1179700	Sex when we when we have it with someone else
1184060	1187860	I don't know. I know
1191340	1196300	Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Okay. All right. Well, that's a brave answer. Yeah
1197020	1199020	From both of you. All right
1200540	1204260	Do you do you think that you're crazy? Yes
1204340	1210620	What do you think that you do you think that you're diagnosably crazy as anything in particular? Uh, I don't know
1210620	1215300	I have no idea probably something but I don't think I've ever been tested
1216180	1221080	Really? Is there like a clinical apathy? I mean, I don't know
1222080	1228200	My grandmother was crazy. Oh, yeah. She went to a mental institution. What did she do?
1233320	1238320	She you know, she just like had a breakdown she was crazy
1238320	1242820	she would like knock on the walls and saying crazy shit and
1243240	1247440	They just had to lock her up. Do you ever yeah, do you ever think like?
1247560	1251960	Oh that I mean I can feel that like like I don't know like you
1252800	1254800	well, first of all, did you have a
1258920	1260920	The
1260920	1263720	Unignorable idea that the walls are more hollow than they should be
1264200	1266820	No, did you have a relationship with this grandma?
1267800	1273480	Not really because she was pretty sedated when I was growing up
1273800	1279440	So you heard the legends a family legend about her break. Yeah, cuz my mom is one out of
1280320	1282480	nine brothers and sisters and
1284040	1286480	It all kind of went down when my mom was like eight
1286840	1292840	so five of them had to go to an orphanage that were under 18 and then the four of them were just like on their
1292840	1297560	Own and so there were just like crazy stories about their whole thing
1297560	1303600	Wait, I got back up to that cuz there is it like a certain amount of your mom's siblings had to go to
1304440	1310520	Because there was no parent there was no no no cuz my grandfather was sick
1310840	1316280	Okay, but then why did what happened to the other ones? That's because I was trying to parse all they were older than 18
1318440	1320440	Wow, yeah
1320480	1325720	Okay, and then the five of them got adopted by my foster grandmother who then had four of her own
1325720	1327720	So then there were nine again
1329080	1333080	But they are the ones in the orphanage there was like that fuck them that would be like 15 and they were like
1333520	1335520	No, all of them in the orphanage one
1336120	1338240	The the what which was your mom?
1339960	1341960	Bernadette
1345400	1347200	Second from the left
1347200	1352320	No, was she an orphanage sibling or was she an orphanage sibling? Yeah, okay
1352320	1357000	So what could you mind taking it is if I'm prying don't you know tell me at any time, but but I don't know
1358240	1360440	Is this gonna be online or something? No
1363040	1367760	But did you so what it's your mom what's to take us through your mom's story from there this is fast
1367760	1371500	I've never known anybody that was in an orphanage. She was in an orphanage in Delaware
1372280	1380280	Catholic orphanage and it was really fucked up. They were like being tortured and they were like, you know, it was not a good situation and
1381280	1386280	And so, you know her third grade teacher my foster grandmother
1386880	1391400	Like basically was like I want to adopt you and she was like I'm not going up without my brothers and sisters
1391400	1393960	Cuz they were all trying to like run away and all this stuff
1393960	1400520	And so then my foster grandmother the third grade teacher just adopted all of them Wow and then had four of her
1400520	1407520	So that means that reading between the lines here that you're that that teacher who became your who you knew as your grandmother
1407520	1408920	Yeah
1408960	1416320	She was teaching some kid who she was very fond of and who's clearly like suffering abuse at home
1416320	1421960	I am orphanage. Yeah, like her your foster grandmother didn't work at the orphanage. She worked at just like
1421960	1426960	No, she worked at the school where all the orphans went and she was like you're great. What the fuck is going on
1426960	1427520	Yeah
1427520	1432440	She just kind of fell in love with her and then she's like I gotta get you out of here and your mom did the
1432600	1434920	the old sitcom cast sound
1436080	1438160	Contract it's not without my sign
1439560	1440880	Yeah
1440880	1445620	She was my third grade teacher to the the grandma was Wow. Yeah
1446040	1451000	Geez, then that must have you when you were like, oh, I didn't do my homework. She's like, okay

1477480	1483440	You got yeah, I got no quip for that man. It's not your job to have quips
1484440	1486440	It's not that kind of show
1487160	1489160	All right
1491880	1494360	He's a substitute there's usually
1495840	1497840	But to answer your question, I

1537000	1541360	Okay, I'll add that to the to the list. No one has ever said that to me
1541360	1544720	I was looking it up and I was actually thinking Oh Aubrey's the guest tonight
1544720	1547760	I wonder like like like this is actually kind of interesting because there's
1548080	1551720	Now that nowadays online you can just look it up and you can just diagnose yourself
1552840	1554840	Is it let me type it in?

1586040	1592600	Well, it just related to meant that brain that's something I think about a lot too
1594840	1598000	But like just like is it gonna happen again, yeah
1600400	1603600	Where were you where were you when when it happened I was
1604400	1611720	In Queens and I was going to I've like told this story before so well, welcome to Harman town
1614720	1620480	And I went into my friend's apartment I was gonna have lunch with them I was 20 and
1621280	1625520	Nothing weird was happening at all and I just in mid-sentence
1625520	1630080	I was talking about a Hillary Duff concert that I had taken my little sister to the
1630840	1632840	Previous that'll do it
1634240	1640160	You're drawing the wrong conclusion from this right after I said the words Hillary Duff I had a stroke
1641280	1643280	Not kidding
1643320	1648240	Goddamn it. I did a real I was like, I should have saved this thing. Wait, but what happened do you blacked out?
1648240	1651600	Oh, no, what happened was the stroke was in my left
1652800	1659140	Temporal lobe, which means that it affects the right side of my body. So my right arm was like completely
1659880	1661160	numb
1661160	1666720	Not numb, but it was just like it wasn't connected to my body and I liked didn't I was confused
1666720	1671640	I didn't know what was going on and then I had expressive aphasia for a couple days
1671640	1676480	Which is where you forget language completely and if you were talking to me
1676480	1682440	I would like understand what you're saying inside, but I wouldn't be able to respond. Oh my god, we're right. Oh
1683160	1687520	Cuz the blood clot was in my language center. And so all right Wow
1688320	1690960	Like I'm so like we've had people on the show
1690960	1695040	Well, we have a we have a friend who comes back who's like survived multiple aneurysms
1695040	1699120	And he's like he's sort of like waiting for the day because they haven't figured out any
1699800	1702600	Solution to it. So he's just like waiting for the you know
1702600	1705920	Yeah, I mean you don't really know like why that stuff happens
1706120	1708000	It's so terrifying to me
1708000	1714160	But it's also like if you were smart emotionally which I'm not and I'm sure the people that that like you that have had gone through
1714920	1719440	Are like like you would just accept the invitation that okay, you can't control anything
1719440	1723600	So why not just like be yourself and just fuck it. Yeah
1724760	1726760	Just eat that cookie
1727360	1730520	Just yeah, that's what I'm talking about in that cookie
1731280	1734600	Yeah, that's what I do eat that cookie. That's right
1735440	1737440	Give me that cookie
1737560	1742900	I'm thinking about getting a cookie like a fake cookie from a website that just sits in on a plate
1743020	1745020	It's just like cookie dot-com
1745900	1751980	Silicon and I can just like nibble on it, but it's like isn't that the responsible thing for me to do
1753020	1755340	That's a person who's been on a lot of diets
1756660	1760160	Like you guys can judge me, but the truth is you're the bullies
1761020	1764960	What do you do? Like like like like like like when people tweet you?
1765980	1769620	Like like like I'm sure people just tweet you and go like you're a piece of shit. Fuck you
1769620	1772380	I just want you to like like like they
1773900	1778620	And that that's I'm positive I'm positive about this
1779740	1781820	You know, I'm sure they tweet that they treat that at everybody
1781820	1787420	I'm saying like but it's like you know because what I get I get like tweets because it's actually based on like my
1787780	1789260	Behavior like for you
1789260	1790860	You could like write it off and go like well
1790860	1796820	I'm famous and I'm an actor and it's like why would I ever respond to this and also this person is just being mean and just
1796820	1802860	Wants to do the opposite of what they perceive the camera doing to me, which is making me powerful and interesting
1802900	1805740	And they just want to like drag me down and it's like pretty easy to write off
1805740	1808200	I would think but I for me
1808200	1815240	It's based on me being an asshole lately and doing wrong things and but what I don't understand is when people tweet at you and go
1816420	1821900	They have 140 characters so that like 30% of the tweets I get they like take you through the journey of them
1821900	1825820	Not liking you like they lead with like I was if I was a big fan
1825820	1831420	I like your shows and I like this and that or whatever but
1832100	1838460	After that thing you did like now you I hate you and I hope you're happy
1840260	1844500	And then I just like I do it to be back I go what you respond to that yeah
1847180	1849380	And how yeah, I
1850740	1854580	Responded to a girl today. She did that and I said I said you kind of like it a little bit
1855020	1862540	Well, I kind of like I feel like I feel like I like I like the people that like try to hurt me because I
1862980	1864340	feel like
1864340	1866560	There must be something that they could like
1867100	1868220	Reach, you know
1868220	1874260	That's like not like I'm that I need to reach because I don't like to feel like I don't like feel like a sociopath
1874260	1879300	Sometimes so I feel like like when somebody's like hey fat fuck you're untalented or whatever
1879300	1881420	I'm like well that feels like nothing
1881420	1885940	But I'd like to talk to you for a second. Like don't you think like if you could like my interest
1885940	1889420	Yeah, do you notice like where the seam of the armor like is right there?
1889420	1893220	Like you're aiming for the bat logo, but like think about think about here
1894180	1897100	Like like and I'm kind of like but I don't really know where it is
1897100	1897940	Cuz if I knew where it is
1897940	1902740	I would like dig in there and like reach around but like I'm like come on like like come on just look look
1902740	1909140	Come on find it like like like why are you saying that? You know, it's like so it's like half couch to like defensiveness
1909140	1913460	And then half in like has it ever turned into a deep friendship
1915620	1920740	Have you ever gone down that path so long that you realize we're just the same
1921660	1925720	You and me I don't I don't think we all the same
1927220	1933100	That would be that would be the world's greatest defense for when people ask me why I do it
1933100	1938740	Why I bother to engage but but here's a here's a here's a good reason why I did it because it sometimes it reveals like
1938780	1944820	Amazing like Jacques Cousteau life under the Twitter see because this this young lady tweeted me today. She did that
1944820	1948780	She took me through her little journey of liking me and then not liking me and I said, thank you
1949260	1955660	That was that's really interesting like how you went through that and like I'm sure if you were living my life
1955660	1962460	Like you would do you so like like like much more gracefully and tactfully or whatever and I didn't ask her anything
1962460	1967640	I didn't I just responded and then she wrote back. She's like, I don't know
1968520	1971400	To to maybe be a good person to
1972480	1978040	Maybe apologize and I was like wait, she's not even it doesn't even make any sense and then I realized holy shit
1978040	1980600	She hallucinated me asking her what I should do
1981480	1983840	She hallucinated me saying what should I do?
1984360	1990440	And I was like, whoa, this is amazing. Like you should look at this like you hallucinated someone saying what should I do lady?
1990560	1995080	Like like that like like that means that no one ever idea what you're talking about
1995920	1997920	Well
1999080	2004480	Understanding I'm sorry. What was it? What was she hallucinating? She so she said
2005360	2008840	You're a piece of shit, whatever and then I said, thank you very much
2009400	2017080	Like that's very interesting. Goodbye. And then she said, I don't know to maybe apologize or something
2017640	2020560	So that's like and I was like, why is she I was like, holy shit
2021080	2026160	Made up in your brain. You made up that I asked you anything
2026720	2029120	Because no one ever asks you
2030920	2036840	Yeah, and so she she was just like oh I thought this was going to be not only a conversation or an argument
2036840	2040660	But specifically one in which someone defensively says what do you want me to do?
2041200	2047400	Because she like no one ever says to her. Hey Daphne. What do you want me to do? Yeah, wait
2047600	2051520	Quentin Tarantino in dust till dawn when he's talking to Juliette, Louis

2190360	2192880	like like like I remember like
2193760	2195760	with one of my earliest memories is a
2196760	2199440	Nursery school, whatever you call it was day care
2200080	2204480	It was day care. I was like and it was like a part of a bowling league that my mom was in in Milwaukee and
2204920	2206920	the women would bowl and
2207400	2210600	In this women's bowling league, so I'm not being sexist. They were all women
2211600	2213600	It's not a stereotype that women bowl
2214360	2217720	It was a league you had they checked back then
2218520	2220600	There wasn't there wasn't the transgender
2221640	2223640	awareness that
2223640	2225560	the
2225560	2232480	And then to put their kids in like this just room at the bowling alley and that's where that girl stuck that crayon in my mouth
2234480	2236000	Yeah
2236000	2238600	Yeah, deep cuts of memory from the show
2239280	2245640	So what there was one day when everybody was like cuz I would just hide cuz it's just like the girls would stick crayons in
2245640	2249720	Your mouth or I don't know that happened more than once. Well, okay. All right. Yeah, I
2250440	2253840	Pluralized it to make it more effective. No, it happened once a girl stuck a crayon on my mouth
2254040	2257680	But but what happened all the time was color wasn't red
2258160	2263640	Like like purple like like deep dark purple like like like like dirty
2264000	2267520	like like dark like if you showed me if you open up a
2268160	2270160	64 color crayola magenta
2271040	2275800	Is that dark though? I don't like a burgundy like deep dark purple II read
2276840	2281640	and it's just like the I'll never forget the taste and the smell and I was like, man and
2282680	2287880	And then like but also then there was like six big wheels and there was like 50 kids and
2288520	2289860	And then we go like okay
2289860	2294000	You can play with toys and everyone run over the big wheels and and and I was just like I just can't take it anymore
2294000	2296380	I can't take it. It was just like go
2296860	2303180	sit in a cupboard, you know, like like like like find a like corner like like or a hole or something and just sit and
2304180	2309380	Is it something like being asked questions and like like like like in gym class if you like want to be left alone
2309380	2313580	Like then they but you have to like hide otherwise, they'll go like what are you doing? What's going on over here?
2313580	2315580	I thought this is Jim can help
2316140	2320520	And he's like you want to avoid the whole conversation. So if you could just disappear you would just disappear
2320720	2327400	So that I did that successfully once and I remember it was such a pleasurable memory that all of a sudden
2327960	2329880	daycare was over and
2329880	2332040	Everybody packed up. Everybody's like, okay
2332040	2336840	we gotta go and all the moms would come like at the end of the love boat or whatever the end of meatballs and like
2336840	2340960	Like everyone's like paired up with their parents and I just I just kept sitting there
2340960	2343800	I was like, I don't think my mom's here like like like and
2344800	2350640	And and and I just and I just stayed there and then they like turned out the lights and shut the whole thing down
2350640	2352640	and then I was alone in the
2353000	2358960	Daycare room and it was dark and I was just like walked around and touched the tables like all melancholy
2358960	2360800	Like I was I always thought I was in a movie
2360800	2366480	So it's like like la la la like like I was like like hearing like a soundtrack of my head like nobody loves me
2366480	2372960	Like but I was into it, you know, I liked I liked the feeling it made me special that I was abandoned
2373080	2376840	I liked it and then then then the doors open like after five minutes of that
2376840	2379240	My mom was like, where were you and I was like fuck this
2381960	2388400	So, no, I don't think yeah, no fear of abandonment I think I like it extreme anger and irritability
2391360	2395760	I mean everybody gets angry but the reason for which others have difficulty understanding
2395760	2398840	So I like yeah, I do I feel like every time I get angry
2399840	2405200	It's it's for a perfectly good reason but then it's for based on other people's reactions. I feel like I
2407200	2409200	Get I get a little irritable
2410000	2416120	Time to time. All right alternating between high positive regard and great disappointment self-harm
2417000	2422720	Suicidal behavior and substance abuse are common. I don't self-harm or suicidally behave
2424360	2428820	Disorder is recognized. Okay. All right. Yeah, I think we write off borderline personality
2429400	2431400	like yay
2436040	2438040	We saved him
2443080	2449440	But but nobody has anything right like this is like what do you what are they trying those are just like packages
2449440	2455520	Those are just for dumb doctors. Like like if somebody comes in and goes like well, I ate a fire hydrant yesterday
2456400	2459760	And I I love I want to have sex with a graham cracker and
2460360	2465840	I hate my mom, but I hate her cuz she won't kill me
2466720	2470120	and the dogs talking to me and I stutter and
2471160	2474040	my left armpit smells like an onion and my right smells like
2475040	2477540	Licorice and then the doctor goes Jesus Christ
2477540	2481760	He goes fucked up and then he like and then he just like takes the book and it goes like well
2482480	2485320	Disease does one of his armpits smell like licorice. He's like, yeah
2485320	2488920	And he's like give them give them this pill and he's like here take this pill
2488920	2493660	And like it's all bullshit all these packets like the the diagnoses are just packets
2494480	2496480	Yeah, I didn't
2496640	2502520	Grow up taking a bunch of pills. No one gave me a bunch of pills. Oh, no, I didn't yeah
2502520	2506200	I didn't I didn't imagine so well, I was just offering that
2508520	2510520	Do your relationships last a
2511120	2514920	Long time. Yeah, like what is a long time?
2516040	2523040	Like five six years that is a long time. Yeah to me. I've never made one last longer than two years. Oh, is that right? Yeah
2523640	2525160	How old are you?
2525160	2526960	42 I
2526960	2528960	Should have a sex doll
2529720	2533800	It would I would be a hero whatever you want. I would be a hero for having one. Yeah
2535120	2537120	Yeah, get one. Yeah
2537200	2538960	Thank you. I
2538960	2540960	Can tell my accountant you said
2541920	2543520	right
2543520	2546600	It's not gonna hurt you. I'll just say Aubrey Plaza told me
2548840	2553800	I don't even have a car like like by the time I get a Tesla like like, you know
2553800	2555800	I could have sorted out all my problems
2555840	2561000	Tesla already. Well, I might not be talking about it forever if I first was a symbol for
2561680	2565960	For a fraction of the price. I might become the healthy enough person to drive a
2566920	2572560	Hatchback of some kind if the sex doll might itch a scratch. That's uh, all right
2576280	2578280	Well, I told you it'd be a bad show
2578960	2584120	Do you want to talk about the thing in the sky? Everybody saw last night on the aliens. Wait, what?
2586640	2590160	No rocket test. Yeah. Oh really? Yeah
2590160	2592160	They
2595920	2600200	Just they shot a missile from a submarine that doesn't even make sense
2601200	2603200	That's how they sure underwater
2604440	2609600	That's that's that's what we want our enemies to to say I can't believe you don't know about this Dan
2609600	2611600	No, I don't know talk of the town
2612080	2615840	So there was stuff for this guy, but it was just a rocket test. I got caught up see a
2616840	2618840	Lot of you wasted a lot of time
2620280	2624040	I could just get my news here. How's how's Bernie Sanders doing?
2626400	2632840	Listen to a great piece on him on NPR. It was pretty great. They interviewed him to talk when he's talking quietly
2632840	2634840	He doesn't even sound ridiculous at all
2638600	2643040	You think he sounds ridiculous otherwise, oh, yeah, absolutely. Who are you voting for?
2643200	2648680	I'm not voting for people based on the ridiculousness of their vote or voice. I'll tell you that right now
2650160	2657480	Like as if you want this someone to be have a more ridiculous voice or it's not the axis on which I'm basing my judgment
2657480	2663880	Here, that's what I'm saying. So whose policies do you like so far? I like Bernie Sanders. I like Donald Trump. What can I say?
2665320	2667580	Either one of those I'm sure it'd be great
2667580	2669580	I
2675460	2681940	Will I will say one one thing that could be it's not a statement of admiration at all
2681940	2687060	It's just a statement of wonderment at which we often express about people we admire
2687060	2691940	But it's this is just wonderment like if I were running for president
2692500	2693580	the
2693580	2695580	day that I
2695740	2699340	Dentally or on purpose said all Mexicans are rapists
2699340	2704900	Like I would just I would go home and I would be like well. All right, so no no no president then but like so
2705420	2707340	lately like
2707340	2712620	It is amazing to me that that the guy that did that is like is is like, okay. Anyways
2712620	2718580	Yeah in a world anyways, he said all Mexicans were eight years ago. The guy went Michigan, Minnesota, Florida
2718820	2720500	Yeah, oh
2720500	2727480	Boy the gap all the gap Oh Dukakis in the tank. Oh, he looks so silly in the tank. What about the tank of
2728740	2734820	Genocidal horrible xenophobia like like the actual that's not a picture. That's not a perception
2734940	2736540	He was just like yeah
2736540	2740100	They're rapists and then and then and then everyone was like like well
2740100	2742460	I think they were cheering because they were there for Donald Trump the
2742980	2748340	Press conference, but he was like then some thing in his head was like you should probably qualify that and he's like
2748340	2750940	I'm sure I'm sure some of them aren't rapists
2752380	2754420	Like there's got to be a couple I'm sure
2755300	2760180	There's an exception every rule and then he and then the next day he was like, okay. What should I do brush teeth?
2763100	2765500	Put on shoes keep running for president
2765940	2771980	Which is amazing to me that really is amazing because I I threw out my back rearranging my office and the next day
2771980	2773980	I I did not go to work
2774740	2776100	And I was like, sorry
2776100	2781420	I had a hard time yesterday and I and I and it turned out I'm not as capable as I thought I was
2781420	2783420	So I'm going to lay in bed and play minecraft
2783420	2788460	And if I called all Mexicans rapists, I would I would twist that into a way to play minecraft. I
2790020	2792020	Would stop running for president
2793620	2797980	And I would think while I was playing minecraft I'd be like the reason I'm doing this is because I don't want to confront
2798340	2803660	What I said, like I want to wait until it's old and you know, and I could sweep it up
2804980	2809260	He's got a lot of self-confidence. Mm-hmm. I'd say learn from that
2810340	2812340	It's true. I do kind of admire him. Oh
2813100	2815100	That doesn't surprise me at all
2816620	2823980	He has too much he has a problematic amount of self-confidence. Yeah, someone say if he had less he'd be a lot better off
2824980	2829620	Just a few. Also, we need new words for confidence and how can he be better off?
2829620	2832260	He's a billionaire who's running for president just for fun
2832660	2838160	It is if he's like, I don't really give a shit. I'm just gonna spend my own money do this for a little bit
2838460	2840460	Yeah much more be
2840540	2845700	He's like now just imagine it could be right just imagine how he could be better. How far he can take it
2845700	2848820	Yeah, yeah, he's he's been running for a long time
2850380	2852980	That's true. What's it running from?
2853980	2855980	Laughter
2859380	2861740	We've already talked about this the fact that we've you know
2861740	2866460	It's been looked at like based on what he was born with at the starting line and based on what he has now
2866460	2871380	He's not a successful person. Like if you were a dishwasher, what was he born with? I don't know
2871380	2876100	I don't he was born with lots and lots and lots of money. Oh, he's a rich little baby
2876100	2876620	Yeah
2876620	2882700	And then he only lost some of it and then lost a bunch of it and then he made a bunch back and then he but
2882700	2884100	He's like if you were a dishwasher
2884100	2886980	He wouldn't even have been loud back in the kitchen at a certain point
2887340	2892740	But you can't get fired from being a billionaire like so you just they're just like oh you're back and it's like come back
2892740	2894740	Cuz I'm awesome and they're like me too
2896980	2900240	Is though I mean I haven't researched it but that's basically it
2901460	2903460	Do you think voting matters?
2904980	2907140	Yeah, you get excited about it, uh
2907940	2912100	Yeah a little bit. Yeah, I don't know. Do you keep your voting to yourself?
2912260	2913500	Yeah
2913500	2918460	You like to go in there and do a discreet like yeah, I wear a cloak
2922100	2924100	No one can see my eyes
2925300	2931260	So you don't talk about like you don't share your process with anybody no, I know only myself
2931940	2935180	How do you pick like the circuit court judges and all that bullshit?
2936180	2941980	Eenie meenie miney mouth. Uh-huh. I go with names cool cool names. Yeah
2943420	2948420	They give a little bio next summer, you know, like a little little little fortune cookie
2948420	2952420	Hey, I was like he wants feet to be illegal and
2953660	2957480	Like wigs to like like like be hats. They're like, yeah
2958380	2963660	I'll look that up later. But yeah, it's got my vote. I think in like 20 years
2963660	2970700	I'm gonna really start caring about those guys and being ready November 3rd with everything all the information
2971420	2974900	Really? The only government that matters is local government. Mm-hmm
2975220	2981420	Because like where you put a stop sign or whether or not your community is functioning is like actually the important thing
2981420	2985180	We should go to one of these Los Feliz neighborhood council meetings. Yeah
2985700	2991020	Yeah, you listen to those Santa Monica ones on the radio. Oh boy. They're like, okay
2991660	2995960	Mr. Frasles, what do you have to say? The buses are talking to me
2998220	3000220	You have a right to feel that way
3001540	3003540	Moving on
3004700	3009380	What is uh, what is the what is what is what are we gonna do Aubrey Plaza
3010420	3012420	about climate change
3012780	3015460	That's my number one issue. Let's talk about it
3021940	3022940	I
3022940	3025980	Don't know we all got a band together and
3027020	3035140	I don't know. I don't I don't think I don't I don't know. All right. I don't know what we can do. Okay, we're fucked I
3036060	3041700	Heard you know, the rainforest is pretty much dead at this point. Like if we don't today start
3042540	3043540	und
3043540	3045540	deforesting
3046500	3051780	The forest is just gonna be gone like we can't just stop now and it'll it'll heal itself
3051780	3058860	It's it's it's a fucked it's fucked and then the whole of global warming will just go off the deep end because there's no rain
3058860	3065560	Forest that have been regulating this whole process for millennia. Yeah, and the oceans too. They're going down
3066180	3069860	Now that he loves they're going up. No, she's they're gonna
3070660	3072660	I
3074300	3077780	Like I've read three things in 20 years and I know you're wrong
3077780	3082660	You're up. You're saying the opposite sea level is rising but the fish are all sinking to the bottom
3083700	3084660	corpses
3084660	3086220	Yeah
3086220	3088420	Fish float when they that's wrong
3089940	3091940	Fish float when they die
3093500	3095500	It's all a metaphor
3096140	3098140	What
3098180	3102860	Do we really think is gonna happen it's just gonna be like, okay, so there will be
3103700	3108660	because it's it's just so many variables because like the thing that panics me is
3109460	3110820	like
3110820	3113540	Sea level because it's the scientists talk about like, okay
3113540	3115800	the sea level is gonna do this and the ice caps are gonna do that but
3116220	3123340	As soon as that stuff has the potential to affect the dollar then everything's just gonna collapse and there won't be
3123580	3130540	It won't be because the ocean is high that like you're like wearing armor made out of bottle caps
3130540	3137620	Like you're you're it'll be because like everything just went to shit and the cops started stopped showing up to work or started hunting
3137620	3145040	people and like like like nothing worked anymore and there was no jobs and everyone was just like riding around a wasteland going like
3154180	3156180	I'm
3156180	3159460	Comfortable here. I don't show that. I'm afraid of it
3159980	3161980	Or I'm not maybe that's been
3162620	3165580	It only takes two generations to leave the gene pool
3166060	3170380	perhaps all the people that were afraid are dead and only the people that
3171580	3177420	Were confident in the post apocalypse. They just kept really reproduced and I'm
3178460	3180460	progeny
3183740	3187860	And I love living I have borderline personality disorder
3189140	3193560	Kind of already happening. Yeah, I mean it is like slowly though
3193560	3195580	The fact that we're not like one day that'll happen
3195580	3200540	But it's just like happening really slowly and we're kind of like seeing it and then we just like get used to it
3200540	3206620	I have the time it happens with the solid all these different things. Yeah, I haven't seen a lot of orange mohawks lately
3206620	3216380	But like, you know, it's not me when you look at the like there's always crazy things that we always talk about we go like
3216380	3217100	That's so crazy
3217100	3217820	but it's like well
3217820	3224860	it's not crazy if if the end result is like Matt max because the idea that we have a quarter of the population of the
3224860	3226000	world in
3226000	3233580	prison like like like I can't remember that statistic. It's like the what is it? What is the the quarter thing?
3233580	3236780	It's like it's something to do with how many how much of America's
3237340	3241140	Population is in prison versus how much of the I can't remember this order
3241340	3247300	Well, it's it's a is it a quarter of the world's prisoners are America in American prisons. Yeah, that's what it is
3247420	3251660	Yeah, that's a lot. I mean so like because because and we're the we're like the country that was like
3251660	3254500	Hey, everybody be free and do what you want
3254500	3258660	And so it's like, okay, and then and then like everybody that's like we're like, okay that guy makes me uncomfortable
3258660	3261900	We'll just put him on a timeout and they're like, let's put that kind of time out
3261900	3265940	Okay, let's put that in a timeout and then like a quarter of the world is going like this is a fun timeout
3266260	3271440	Like like I'm gonna learn how to do more in here. Okay, I'm back out. Okay. I'm doing more. Okay, you're going back in
3272060	3275460	And then it's like yeah, that's that's that's that's huge. That's crazy
3275540	3281820	Like those those folks are gear in up there. They're they're the they're the face of evolution
3281820	3285620	Mm-hmm, they're little ones are getting on the big ones backs. Yeah
3287420	3291380	Go buddy master blaster from the Thunderdome
3292020	3296960	I could tell you didn't know the reference. I yeah, I got a third Mad Max movie
3298380	3302980	Do you know how to fly a plane? No, do you know, okay
3304500	3307980	Helicopter you wouldn't leave that helicopter if you knew how to fly a helicopter
3307980	3312380	I wouldn't want you wouldn't leave out helicopter if you knew how you know, I don't know how to fly anything, right?
3314340	3320820	Important to start right like like those are the people that survive. Sorry. I'm a yellow belt and crap my guy so
3321980	3329140	I don't think they have young belts in craft my god. It's the first belt. Well, that's not impressive then
3334180	3336780	Signed the pamphlet about athletes put in the shower
3340020	3346540	I'm just I'm closer is what I'm saying. I feel like all you need is like, you know a helicopter and a weapon
3347540	3349540	I mean
3350180	3354580	Like if you had a helicopter and you started hoarding gas like if you were I mean
3354580	3357780	But I wonder what income level you have to be to have a helipad right now
3358220	3361980	You have to be a one percenter, right? Like you can't just have a helicopter
3362420	3367220	But if you have that would make me feel really secure that would be amazing because you could just start hoarding gas
3367740	3370020	That would be great. But you I mean
3371020	3374580	Well, like is the idea okay to fly away
3374580	3380460	It's the idea and just stay aloft or to find a place where society still exists
3380460	3381980	Well, obviously snipe them out
3381980	3390740	Well, you land somewhere where there's more gas and then you find that while you've shoot zombies or poor people whatever if there's helicopter
3390740	3393500	Gas lying around I feel like you're in a great position
3394140	3400460	Automatically if there's what if there's still refining helicopter gas free to find just freely wherever you go
3406860	3413100	That's just your you just doubled out on I can't argue with Aubrey about how
3413740	3419500	Helicopter gasoline works. She's she's she knows everything. I want to see a montage. No, but
3420100	3421460	I
3421460	3427180	You you don't you don't see a world where the world has effectively or civilization has effectively collapsed
3427180	3431460	But there's a lot of places around where you could still find the gasoline
3431460	3433060	I feel like if I'm you know
3433060	3439340	I'm in the apocalypse and everyone's in the apocalypse and people are wearing bottle caps and shooting at each other because they have nice
3439540	3446020	Carhood ornaments or whatever the fuck flying around in a helicopter is gonna be the best way to get shot at and
3446460	3449420	They're also very they're not like it's also the best way to get missed
3450260	3454340	Well, they're not that fast. I mean, yeah, but you're way far away and up in the air
3454340	3459340	Well, it depends on what you're doing with the helicopter, but a lot of helicopters, you know, they're not too high
3459540	3463780	They're very lightly armored. You could you could just shoot them down with a cap gun
3463780	3470280	I wasn't thinking about it like a battle zone. I was just thinking like, you know natural disasters getting that helicopter
3471000	3475360	I know it would work with an earthquake. Certainly. I was thinking battle zone
3475360	3479760	but I guess part of me naively thought that that that our same worship of of
3480480	3486520	Celebrity or richness would somehow purvey in that one way that if you were down here like shooting each other with a k-47
3486520	3490020	Said I like after fly over and you go. I wonder if that's David Hasselhoff
3492480	3497920	Maybe maybe if I shoot enough people with this assault rifle, I'll be having lunch with him one day
3498120	3504000	Well, you could just shoot the helicopter and force yourself. I mean, you're like a life hack guy. I didn't put that together
3504920	3509200	He reads those life hack tumblers is why he's saying that stuff. I didn't put it together
3509200	3515640	I thought a helicopter could just go so far up that a bullet couldn't hit it. It can it's just not practical
3516440	3523020	Maybe a surface terror missile though. I mean, yeah, bring it like like yes, let's good. Yeah. Okay. Yeah
3523480	3525480	Bring your surface to your missile out
3525760	3526920	please
3526920	3528920	wait, wait, wait, like you
3529200	3536400	If people have those I don't want to be on the ground and you know, you got to hit a helicopter right in the jugular
3537120	3539040	you can't just
3539040	3544240	That thing will bounce right off that up. It's like the 90% of splitting blades
3544920	3549840	Like the gas is like like there's a most things that you're gonna get chopped in 17 pieces
3549840	3553320	It probably like half of them probably go back down and hit the guy that shot it
3553640	3557840	One of them will make a little heart you'll make a necklace out of it. Yeah
3559320	3561920	Absolutely. Same page Club about
3562720	3564720	about helicopters
3565240	3570280	Well, you guys can have your helicopter and me and Ridley will hang out with our missiles and we'll see what happens
3571320	3576400	Well, if I if I okay if I have a no, I'll take a helicopter over a missile cuz here's what I'd do
3576400	3578280	I'd fly the helicopter early
3578280	3582200	I would do it before anybody would thought that shooting a missile was like a good idea
3582200	3587240	And I would tick because I would go oh because that wouldn't be a luxury that you would have if you had a helicopter
3587240	3590880	You would go. Well, it says on the news that Donald Trump won for instance
3590880	3595640	Let's why don't we just go for a long weekend on a helicopter trip?
3596160	3601320	Like we do whenever we get nervous. They will go to the underground bunker
3601920	3605040	like, you know and then and then hey
3605800	3610480	I'd love to be wrong. You come back and you're like, ha everyone's like, how was your weekend?
3610720	3615560	I spent it out of town. They're like, did you did you abandon all of us because you thought
3616880	3621200	And you didn't call anybody and you thought it was every man for himself and you got in your helicopter and
3621800	3623800	And you're like, okay. What's the difference?
3625840	3631520	You know, Bill Lawrence has a beach house like like like like come on knucklehead
3631520	3633240	No, then you let's get back to work
3633240	3640040	And by the way, you can get machine guns for your helicopter to shoot at Spencer and I I shouldn't be giving you that tip
3640120	3641600	But I'm just saying
3641600	3644960	You're not defenseless up there. I'm assuming this is like a news chopper
3645480	3648320	Yeah, that'd be hilarious. Like I got it
3650640	3654680	Like I go yeah, like you get it you would get it used from like
3655560	3657320	Ktla or something
3657320	3664600	You could buy used helicopters. Oh, no, you're talking. This is pre apocalypse purchasing. Yes. Okay, I'm sorry
3665160	3669200	Well, I'm never gonna have that much money. So I don't know why we're talking about this you guys are
3669360	3671360	Yeah, thank you lady. I
3672600	3677360	Don't know why you reacted that way, but I don't know why anything that happened tonight happened tonight
3681720	3684480	Do you do you think that bug bites are
3685240	3692080	Aubrey Plaza, do you think that bug bites are I can can heal or not heal based on the psychological health of a person?
3692080	3698160	Yes, actually when I'm when you were talking about that back there. I was thinking about a time when I had a lot of bug bites
3699160	3702680	And you thought it was cuz you were extra crazy at that time. Uh-huh. Oh
3704160	3708040	Well, that's good. Well, you know, I like my therapist and I don't want to stress
3709320	3712120	Okay, that's what I was saying. I think I'm under a lot of bad bugs
3713280	3717840	No, not bad bugs. They don't leave bite bites. Oh, they do sure well
3717840	3721880	They leave like well like bed bugs are distinct though, right? You you lived in New York
3721880	3725840	You you know what bed bugs I've only I got bed bugs once in Seattle
3726760	3731560	What these aren't bed bugs like they'd be it'd be all over my that bug bites are body
3731560	3735280	It would be like are there little colorful strings coming out of them?
3740160	3742560	No, okay
3744120	3746120	Are you sure I
3747920	3749920	Feel so funny
3750400	3754800	Because I didn't know if I said if I said no if you'd say definitely bed bugs
3755240	3758720	Or I just I've never heard that asked about any bite ever
3759400	3764000	Like I said, I had a real like psychological like people see strings coming out of them called
3765080	3767080	Margelons. Yeah
3768160	3770160	Magellan
3770680	3772680	Yeah
3772800	3774800	It's a psychological
3774840	3779720	Illusion that you see yeah colorful strings think that they can pull a little
3780360	3786880	Neon fibers out of their little bites. We got a head nod in the front row. They see them, right?
3787480	3789480	You saw it on TV or something
3791560	3796320	Why you not in your head again, I know sorry does
3800200	3802200	Everybody's doing a terrible job
3805160	3807160	But why strings
3807600	3811400	You know, it's a cosmic DNA I would I would think
3813080	3821520	You ever see that the cosmic serpent it's about a guy goes and does ayahuasca in the Amazon and he realizes that plants
3821840	3826640	have always been talking to people and that's why the Amazonians have aspirin and
3828360	3831200	Why why they know how to make like
3831840	3839160	Curare without dying because like you could you could never just trial and error curare because it would like kill you
3839400	3841160	like statistically
3841160	3844400	so they think that he this guy because he's tripping on
3845040	3847000	Amazon acid like
3847000	3852000	Realizes that it's because plants can talk to people on a cellular level. Well through
3853280	3855760	like photonic rays I
3856760	3861440	I had a theory like that one time. I did a lot of nitrous oxide and
3862160	3864800	I went under and when I came back up
3864800	3869400	I had the recognition that the world had a code, you know
3869400	3874620	Like programming code and it was base four and the four things
3874620	3878040	it could be where the four colors green red blue and yellow and
3878560	3883520	Everything exists as combinations of these green red blue and yellow and so like, you know
3883680	3890440	happiness is like a color and sadness is a color and anything that anyone can do can be represented in these fruit four colors and
3891000	3894720	I had to write it down and I couldn't figure it out and it took me
3895360	3898600	Like about a week of nitrous to figure out what I was talking about
3900960	3906560	And that's and that's all I got is just that is pretty disappointing
3908040	3912760	But but a fruitful research project there's something to it though. I think there might be
3913640	3919520	I never knew that you did that. I I mean very occasionally. It's like a spiritual thing, you know
3919520	3922120	It's like I'll go on sabbatical and do some nitrous
3923480	3928740	Were you just doing whippets like yeah, yeah canisters from the store. Oh, yeah, that's good stuff
3930800	3938120	You can make a ton of whipped cream, you know, you can also make you can make cupcakes using whipped cream chargers
3938760	3944240	You just put the the nitrous into the cupcakes and then you could just put them in the microwave
3944480	3946680	This sounds like I'm on nitrous right now
3947320	3954080	But also you've really like you're taught you're telling us the how to use it properly. Yeah. Yeah to make cupcakes
3954080	3960120	Oh, yeah, if you make any any any cake like thing brownies, but you infuse it with nitrous oxide
3960120	3963400	It'll it'll cook right up in a microwave real fast. Oh
3964200	3966400	soft texture moist
3968280	3973040	You name it. I got all sorts of things for all sorts of kinds of people
3974320	3978440	replaza, do you have any opinions about substances like are you a
3979240	3987120	Straight-edge person. Do you enjoy drugs and alcohol or one or not the other? I have a weed license. Oh, yeah, that's right
3988960	3990960	Thank you
3991520	3993520	You're supported
3993840	4000440	Mine mine keeps expiring. I feel like they like mine too. They figured out the solution to the they're like
4000440	4006360	Oh, well like they're arguing about whether to legalize weed and then somebody in the room that pushed it through was like guys guys
4006600	4012920	We'll just make it you have to renew it every year. Like it's like like these people don't even get their driver's license renewed
4013960	4018280	Like it's gonna be hard for them. Like it won't be an out of control situation
4018880	4021640	And is there ever a moment cuz in my mind
4021640	4025320	I'm always like waiting for like a moment where I can just whip it out
4025320	4029460	And I feel like there's never really is that ever really you mean like when you actually go to buy it
4029600	4031600	Well, just when you get a license
4031640	4039760	I'm like in my head like thinking, you know, like imagining myself on the street. Oh, no, like they'd stop you and go. Oh, right now
4040720	4043520	Missy ma'am. It's like you're smoking a bit of a reefer
4048520	4050280	It checks out
4050280	4054960	But you really ought to do this in the privacy of your home. Well legally I don't have to
4056080	4058340	Pick I'm just a cop
4060760	4063880	Well, I think you better cop somewhere else
4066520	4069800	Swinging me nightstick and wander off
4072520	4075140	Fine walk away whistling I can still hear you
4076140	4078140	On the other side of the street
4079900	4082420	You're the loudest worst whistler ever
4085020	4087100	It's like 40% air
4091020	4093020	It's not even a song
4094580	4101820	Well, this is the police station I if you keep following me then you're being the weird one I'm going inside to talk to me friends
4101820	4106420	Hey, do you want to come to my house?
4108100	4110100	Get out of here
4110580	4112580	Get the fuck in my house
4113060	4115060	Jesus Christ
4117260	4123740	I'm obligated by an unknown state to go in the house and give you my gun. Here you go
4124900	4126900	Now I'm gonna make you a pie
4128020	4131300	You better use enough nitrous oxide to make it go fast
4132820	4136540	Or I'll don't take you by the scruff of your neck down to that
4136540	4140140	But I do always think about that scenario and I don't think it'll ever happen
4140300	4145060	No, I think I mean the card is like fruit, you know, it's just like when you buy I don't even have the card
4145060	4149700	I just have the paper right what that certificate. I was so excited the first time
4149700	4151540	I was like like like I did it in an afternoon
4151540	4156200	But it took all afternoon and I had to like go through this dumb like it's like
4156540	4161140	California is now the most backward state because it's like fought four other states that are just like yeah, it's just weed
4161140	4164740	It's legal recreationally and now we're the ones that did it first
4164740	4170980	But you now still have to talk to a guy in a Cuban shirt with a stethoscope around his neck and a ponytail
4171740	4173740	What is the stethoscope for?
4176900	4178900	It's it's for it's it's for
4179540	4183200	Surveillance is what it's for. It's for people taking pictures of you and you leave work
4184660	4190220	Yeah, and you have to like I don't know I always I felt like I felt like they were trying to trick me into like
4191180	4196940	Admitting I just wanted pot like like like them of all people. They're the ones selling it, but I was like I felt like kind of
4198060	4201980	It's humiliating the whole process and I don't have to those disgusting
4202580	4205740	lobbies where you have to sit and yeah watch those
4206740	4209820	And then like and then your friend is like just dude nausea nausea
4211900	4216260	Insomnia, I'm not gonna lie, but it's like I guess I'm fucked up enough that it was like fine
4216260	4220020	Yeah, you want to be like we know what we're doing, right? Yeah, just give it to me
4220220	4223460	Why are you being like that? Like, why are you acting so weird?
4223460	4229140	Yeah, the whole point of legalizing this is to try to eliminate this the fucking phoniness man. Yeah
4229620	4231900	Not to enhance it. Yeah
4233020	4239800	We'll get there. We're good, right? Nothing's happening in Oregon and Colorado and wherever else it's legal
4239800	4244940	Like there's those states haven't collapsed Colorado is more money than it knows what to do with
4247140	4249140	Got a got a yup from Dave Klein

4546800	4553760	Yeah, I believe in it and this guy's a mastermind with it. He creates a thing where he says my my motherfucking medium is not
4554640	4556640	Color it's not paint
4557280	4558880	Fucking perception
4558880	4563920	So he challenges you to like essentially go beyond the rim of like what you can do
4564720	4570400	Perceptually, so if you stand at the edge of this guy's thing at LACMA, you literally lose your
4571360	4573360	perceptual self and I've

4591640	4593640	Okay, no time no space no

4599880	4601200	like abyss
4601200	4607000	Can't find our way out and then like finally like realize that like our perception is like something beyond our body

4912220	4914220	Shameful you should be ashamed of yourself
4914900	4919980	And the fact that you won't even admit it. That's the fucked up thing. I had to drag it out of you
4921340	4926700	Like be honest about how racist you are guy a guy in the front row
4928100	4930100	Um
4930100	4933740	Yeah, hold on a second. Just give me a second
4935860	4938660	Okay, so we did that
4942660	4949020	I thought I had something on my mind. I think we should all right. Let's uh, yeah
4949740	4953460	You're gonna you get you get a heart out. You're gonna take off. Yeah, I
4954460	4957860	Mean the next thing that we do is we play in a game that you played with us on
4958020	4961820	Kind of like how you played on Harmon quest. Yeah, I don't I don't know about that
4961820	4965620	You had right now you had enough of that when you did that show I got an early morning
4965620	4969860	yeah, well like anything you want us to look out for when you're
4970900	4978020	as you leave us like if we wanted to consume more Aubrey Plaza any book or comic book or or
4978900	4985560	Anime or or a special orthopedic shoe or or a short film. No, I got nothing. Okay
4986780	4988820	Well, you said you had work in the morning, so
4991900	4996300	I'm gonna be in a movie that comes on January called dirty grandpa
5002100	5005700	All right, well I have sex with Robert De Niro, oh shit
5006500	5010300	Is that what he does in the intern or does he just hang out he just
5010940	5014860	Okay, me neither. I saw the commercials. It just looks like he just goes to work, but but
5016260	5018100	But your movie makes more sense
5018100	5022660	It's like like like there's a threshold like in the trailer. It would be like oh, it's an old guy and he's like
5022660	5027460	Oh, it's me and then the 30 seconds into the trailer. It'd be like yeah, but then you know, then the
5028180	5031860	Well, he's an intern right, but he's old so he just gets food
5032500	5034460	Yeah, and he's old
5034460	5038500	Right, but he said he doesn't he doesn't just play a grandpa and dirty grandpa. Okay, but it's not called dirty intern
5038500	5044340	Okay, you know what we've we and you don't want to ask what it's like to film a lovemaking scene with Robert De Niro
5044340	5047500	I don't think you get that opportunity very often and I'm assuming
5048180	5051480	All right. Well, it's been asked. I mean if you want to answer it Aubrey before you go
5053100	5055100	I think she's gonna say I don't know
5055420	5057420	No, I know. Oh, okay. I
5059900	5061900	Know
5062500	5064500	I
5065980	5067980	You know, it was very interesting I
5075700	5077620	At one point I
5077620	5082940	Put in his entire nose in my mouth and I sucked on it really hard and then I threw him down on the bed
5082940	5085220	And it just started gushing blood all over me
5085820	5087820	Wait, what you?
5088260	5090260	I
5090300	5092300	That's not in the movie though
5094460	5096460	Is it gonna be in the blooper reel
5097180	5099180	and credits
5099900	5102420	His nose ended up in your mouth accident
5103260	5107300	You were like sucking on it cuz you're like you're such a dirty grandpa and you're like into the scene
5107300	5109300	I was just trying to be creative
5109820	5114780	And then and then some unexpected movement happened and his nose like broke in your mouth or something
5114780	5118340	I don't think I don't think it broke. Just I set some kind of
5119300	5121300	guys are off
5121740	5128420	You squeezed loose some kind of did you freak out cuz you made Roberts in your blood. Yeah, I would too. Yeah
5131220	5135180	And then he and then he and then he he just yelled for an ice cube
5135820	5140060	Okay, can I get an ice cube? Can I get an ice cube? Can I get an ice cube?
5140060	5144940	Yeah, can I get an ice can I get an ice cube, please? Thank you
5144940	5149380	I'd like can I get an ice cube? Is that what did he say it like that? Yeah, he repeated it a lot
5149380	5157580	Yeah, did you apologize profusely? No, I not really know really why I mean it wasn't
5158140	5162140	I don't know. Maybe it was my fault. Maybe I should have apologized. I
5163740	5166960	Don't know. I was just you know in character
5170060	5173140	But he wasn't he was like, I don't know
5173780	5180380	He wanted an ice cube and then he he was probably grateful just for the experience. I'm sure he's a sweet sweet
5181180	5184080	Older man, and he's happy to be out there working with the kids
5185940	5192460	And that's a story he has now as long as he didn't endure any permanent harm. He's he's probably happy it happened
5193140	5196860	Yeah, I don't know. It probably didn't even hurt. I get nosebleeds all the time
5197500	5198500	Yeah
5198700	5200060	Yes
5200060	5203820	You should let yourself off the hook. Yeah, I was just trying to you know
5204500	5207020	Come up with some interesting, you know
5207620	5213140	Anecdote about it just you know, did you make it all up was the whole thing made up? No, it's it's true
5213140	5215140	All right. Well, you didn't you know
5215220	5222180	Happen you're saying I should have like I should have picked a peek of their reaction and said every puzzle is gonna leave
5223060	5225060	But
5225060	5230080	No, I just I mean it was you know, it was a weird thing that happened. So I just thought I'd tell you about it
5231380	5236820	Yeah, it's the kind of thing you talk about on a talk show, right? Yeah, you know like right now, yeah
5237660	5239700	But Kim will know what to do with it
5244060	5248180	Yeah, yeah, and I don't you know, that's not gonna hurt me you saying that I
5249260	5251420	Don't consider myself in competition with him
5252260	5258300	I I think that what I do is more art than science. I think he's more of a scientist
5262980	5265880	Did he like what did you have any interactions with
5266220	5270500	With DeNiro, I mean even before you bite his nose and have it spout blood into your mouth
5270500	5275340	Like it's already weird just to meet him on a set like yeah, I was weird like what is weird
5275340	5280140	What's your first interaction with him? Like does he like come out in a bathrobe and go
5282180	5284180	You want to do this?
5290980	5292980	And then you said yes
5294740	5299460	We didn't talk like I didn't you know, we didn't like braid each other's hair, right
5300180	5304880	Did you see his nose as a cartoon roast chicken when you first met him?
5305660	5307500	Yeah. All right
5307500	5314900	But in the movie, is that the only scene so it was literally like he met you and then you guys were doing this scene or
5314900	5321320	No, the whole move. No, the whole movie is like I'm a supporting character in the movie and the whole like throughout the movie
5321320	5327140	It's just like his character is like I'm gonna fuck you and I'm like, I'm gonna fuck you too
5327820	5334180	And then we don't until the very end. So it's like a build-up kind of thing. Is that a spoiler? Oh, I don't know
5334180	5336620	I mean, we already know he's a dirty grandpa from the
5338020	5340020	Dirty dirty
5340020	5344540	It's not like he says I'm gonna do something to you and you're like I can't wait to find out what well
5344780	5349500	Are you supposed to not think it's really gonna happen cuz like come on. That's I don't know
5350180	5355860	I'm not sure. I don't have a perspective on that. But um, well, nobody listens to this
5355860	5360980	Anyway, yeah, of which you said you in the green room. You're gonna be on criminal minds, which you are
5361980	5366060	Loud to say or no, I don't I'm sure they would be fine. Well, it's not like I care
5366060	5371860	But I don't want to it's like you're gonna ruin their show or anything. I don't know what how television works me neither
5373300	5376100	Anything I spent six years trying to figure it out
5376100	5379780	It's like and then they were like TV's dead and I was like, I just got started the
5380820	5386780	You're playing a serial killer on Criminal Minds, which was the show that Patrick Brewster was on apparently and uh, yeah
5386780	5388980	And it's been on CBS for a million years
5389700	5397120	11 years. Yeah, and yeah, you're gonna serial kill people. That's right. Hmm. Oh, that's why you gotta get up. Yeah
5399420	5406060	You also like I I was like now you gotta go oh was oh, yeah, that's that's yeah, that's it. That's the alarm
5406060	5408060	That's her hard out
5408140	5409420	you
5409420	5416500	You you do you do an amazing Sarah Silverman impression that I won't make you do because I you don't like to be pimped to do
5416620	5424260	Impressions, right? No, but that it's so weird that that is still like because the time at which I did that
5424260	5426940	it was I was like preparing for my
5427940	5429940	SNL like audition
5430300	5437540	likes years ago and at that time when I was doing like, you know when I would make like a dumb video or
5438140	5442540	Dude, whatever comedy. I would like put it on YouTube just to like
5443180	5444580	Have it on there
5444580	5450420	But in my mind it wasn't like I'm putting it on here so that it goes viral or like it was like not well
5450420	5456300	It's a magnificent impression. Okay. Yeah notable. It's also on your tumbler. You could take it, right?
5456300	5458300	But my tumbler is like, how do I
5461340	5465820	So long ago, yeah, I don't know but that's where I saw it. It was like it's linked
5466820	5472420	Videos, they're just there. They're just out there. Yeah, but yeah, that was like an impression I did. That's right
5472420	5474500	Yeah, that was long. It's really good
5474500	5479620	And I would urge people to just go look for it because it's a really good Sarah Silverman impression
5479620	5481020	I'm sure it's from yeah
5481020	5481420	I mean, yeah
5481420	5487380	I don't know like I never I didn't know her obviously at the time and I never thought in my head that
5487620	5495460	Eventually, I would like, you know know her. So yeah, it's a total like she's the coolest
5496540	5499100	All right. Let's thank Aubrey Plaza for coming by
5503300	5507180	She's being taken to the Harman town helicopter on the roof
5510620	5512620	Where she will be out of
5515340	5517340	Rifle range
5519340	5525300	All right, so now is the most exciting part of the show we get to spend the next seven minutes
5526940	5528940	Figuring out who's gonna play Shadowrun with us
5529060	5530420	Now
5530420	5536900	We don't have to base it on gender balance because as you've noticed with this show I've had a lot of female guests
5537660	5539660	Solved that problem. Remember when that was an issue
5540980	5542980	So now we can just base it on
5543260	5548740	What hey, oh, hello. What's up? What were you? Well, I was gonna maybe see you on a story
5548740	5552980	But oh you're gonna shoe earn a story. Go ahead. Yeah, I'm debating whether I want to tell a story
5552980	5554980	But I feel like it's I want you to tell a story
5555620	5562140	You have to now other. Okay, so we we just started back to work on Rick and Morty season 3
5562660	5564100	Hold your applause
5564100	5571100	Hold your applause and we hired for the first time after two seasons all male writing staff
5571100	5573340	We hired four female writers, right?
5575940	5578620	And there's a little bit of an adjustment period
5579620	5581220	And
5581220	5586580	the other day do you remember this for you in the room the other day we were talking and and one of the female writers said
5586780	5588780	very innocently and very
5590020	5594620	Naively as if she was talking about a furry or someone who has sex with
5597140	5598860	Can openers like she goes
5598860	5605740	Oh, what if he's like one of those weird guys who likes to come on women's faces and tits and there's a long beat
5605740	5607380	I was in Justin goes
5607380	5609380	Yeah, those guys are weird
5611940	5615900	And then his face turns seven shades redder than that solo cup
5617460	5624620	And that's when you realize there's some communication that's gonna have to be bridged. Yeah, there's some differences in perspective and
5626580	5629540	Yeah, that's a funny moment it was yeah, I
5630140	5632140	remember the first day of work I
5632900	5637140	Really I've because I've never there's something there's something interesting about a
5638900	5644260	Gender balanced writers room specifically because it's like, you know, it's been your your you know
5644260	5647580	Once you fall in love with a woman, you don't like as a guy
5647580	5651740	You there's never a point where you well, there might be you don't do a big Q&A about tampons
5651980	5654860	Like like like you don't go like how does the applicator work and all this stuff?
5654860	5660300	Like it's kind of something you can get to 42 as I discovered without really knowing and I just kind of can't was
5660300	5664460	It's sort of like a field day. I was I was like, alright explain that cuz yeah, they were we were taught
5664460	5667660	we were talked they talking about a story about summer like
5668500	5671740	Summer the possibility of summer doing a vodka soaked
5673860	5675860	The possibility the possibility
5677220	5679260	She's a 17 year old girl the show and
5679940	5681940	You know, it's like we were very we're very
5682300	5687900	We're very hands-on about because it's easier to do for guy writers with a 14 year old guy character
5687900	5692740	It's just like we've shown Morty is very much an authentic 14 year old boy
5692940	5696660	like sexually speaking but summer is kind of like, you know, she's
5697020	5701380	we've we've and I think we were smart to do this and judicious like we've kind of she's
5702260	5704260	She we haven't touched her like
5704820	5706820	intimate sides at all
5707300	5713140	If it's all male writers room, you just shouldn't I was never gonna go there like with a 17 year old girl character
5713140	5714940	It'll be like oh then of course, you know
5715020	5721500	She starts humping a pillow when you start breaking a sweat when you're talking about. Yeah, sir. Yeah, it's probably yeah
5721500	5726700	They're not gonna get a lot of comedy, but now we have like half and half. It's like a full representation of everything
5726700	5731740	So it's nice. It was like sir talking about, you know, they're probably never it's not like we're gonna do an episode about vodka tampons
5731740	5736420	But the the the conversation came up and then it was like that led to holy shit
5736420	5740800	I have 95 questions about tampons and I got them all answered within five minutes
5740920	5742200	I
5742200	5747600	One of them came out and I was like like like I like I poked my finger and the thing came out like I was like
5747600	5752560	No, why is the little head shaped like a little penis head? They're like, oh, that's just an accident. That's not
5754720	5757000	Imagine all the questions you can ask your sex doll
5763760	5766100	I mean we also talk about other stuff, too
5766940	5771580	It's not why we hired for women good ideas
5772980	5774980	And it's not all they wanted to talk about
5776100	5779200	It was a two-way it was a it was a collaboration
5779700	5782740	But I liked it. I never thought I'd see the day on Rick and Morty community
5782740	5784820	We started out of the gate. We had we had
5785380	5787380	balance gender wise
5787900	5792240	so it was always just that kind of show always just felt because it was a sitcom and it was
5793100	5795500	relatively mainstream Rick and Morty obviously is like
5796140	5801820	It's more of a cult hit. There's a there's a there's a boyish energy to it
5801820	5805540	I'm not saying that anyone that's that's not boyish isn't allowed to watch it
5805540	5807700	Oh, it's just saying like there's definitely a a
5808500	5814020	Boyish energy to the to the to the show and has always been an all-male writers room and I never thought that's very interesting
5815300	5817300	To have some ladies in there
5818020	5820020	Talk about Tim
5820540	5823700	Well, you brought it up you wanted to tie you thought so fucking fascinating
5824220	5826220	I don't know you're gonna turn into Charlie Rose
5827100	5828500	Jesus
5828500	5831260	Never thought that it would be so interesting to see such
5831860	5833860	gender diversity
5833900	5839180	It's a bad show big deal you get little what's your favorite show in the world?
5839180	5843580	I I bet they had like eight bad episodes the last in the last 12 weeks
5845300	5848460	The Jets that's sports humor Dave, I don't get it. I don't get that
5849300	5854420	Unless you're talking about there's a show called the Jets like the new wings or something
5856900	5862580	I'm just saying like give me a goddamn break. I'm going through a divorce. I'm gonna I'm fucking mannequins. I
5863740	5865740	Can't come here and have a shitty show
5866300	5868300	Fuck you people
5869020	5873060	Like what do you what are you gonna do fire me arrest me? I
5873940	5878140	I I I the word fire me caught in my throat. I was
5878460	5880460	I
5881620	5885380	Happened so often. I was like wait don't don't say that again
5886740	5888860	Could get they could figure out how to fire you
5890380	5896620	What are those what are those people doing on Twitter? What do they mean when they go like you're you're bad person you tweeted
5896620	5900700	Wrong, you did a bad thing. I'm like, well, what are you gonna? What do you what? What are you gonna do now?
5900700	5907180	I don't understand what you're gonna do. I just so like like why would you why why how small is your brain?
5907180	5913020	That you would be like, hey, I wanted to let you know that you're that you're you morally disappointed me
5913260	5921620	Like you that you're that you are a pettier person and I'm letting you know through Twitter because I'm an arbiter of
5922500	5924500	Twitter cat
5925020	5929540	You don't you don't get it like I mean, I don't know I get why someone would just
5930100	5933900	Anonymously log on and go to Tom Hanks like fuck you fuck this
5934860	5937020	You get a small dick, baby
5939180	5942460	Let's make that like a box of chocolates bitch I
5943180	5945180	Get that that's vandalism
5945260	5950580	That's like that's like oh if I could just get through to somebody but it's like like these people like really honestly if you
5950580	5955220	Hooked them up to a lie detector and said are you just doing that? They would say no
5955220	5959540	I'm not just doing that and the lie detector would not go off. They would they would be telling the truth
5959540	5965180	They'd be like no, I'm I'm like I'm a good person and I I'm good at life
5965180	5972700	And I like I like this person. I read about him on a hashtag or a or a dot dot dot dot slash and
5973860	5980340	And I clicked over here, and I'm just I'm giving him two cents and there it is. There's my two cents. I
5981420	5985340	Just don't get it. Yeah, man. I've never done that in my life. It's like YouTube comments
5985340	5988700	It's like I mean sure you're not the guy who's writing the YouTube comments
5988740	5994420	But you can't say you don't understand the impulse for anyone who's a fucking idiot to put those words up there
5994420	5998380	Just because that's what they feel like doing in a certain amount of the cases though
5998380	6002420	I can absolutely say I don't understand. I do not understand. They got thoughts
6002420	6006980	They gotta they gotta shit him out because they don't have other people that don't understand them
6006980	6013140	But I mean if you're that dumb, then you could be honest. You don't have to try. Well. They are no
6013140	6016900	They're not honest at all. They're like they're they're so self-deluded like it's like
6016900	6018820	That's the thing is like if I was that dumb
6018820	6024860	I would just like run around the street and go like pants shoes to the lunchbox sky blue
6024860	6031700	I'm an idiot like I don't care about anything, but myself I love cookies and asphalt a booga booga boop boop boop
6031700	6035420	Like I do so excited people do that too though. I
6036340	6040220	Don't know it's I was thinking the other day that there's this thing you know
6040220	6045820	It's like when you exercise you get all those endorphins going your body's like I'm doing a good thing and like you go on
6045860	6048740	Rides on the amusement park, and it's like adrenaline is good
6048740	6052980	I'm having fun and like you get in a fight and like your blood is rushing
6052980	6055980	And you know you you're on this high or like really intense
6055980	6062420	I feel like the internet and yelling at people on the internet is giving people like a tiny hit of that like I'm going out
6062420	6067620	To beat the shit out of someone except there's no harm in it, and there's no danger in it
6067620	6071780	So it's like why would you if you could pick any fight and never get hurt?
6071780	6074700	Why wouldn't you pick fights? You know and I feel like maybe some people
6075700	6080020	much other than just going like because that's the equivalent going like
6081060	6083060	Like you could just go boo
6083420	6089220	But they like they type boo, and it takes them like well. They're they think yeah, that's how they talk
6089220	6092260	It's like they wouldn't just say boo. They'd be like actually
6092980	6097180	You know what you're saying is it's wrong if you're in Spain
6097540	6102700	So keep a note of that next time you're in Spain. That's just like that's what their thought process is
6102700	6109540	It's not your thought process, but it's it's theirs. It's bad probably but and then a healthy person
6110180	6113260	Aside from going nowhere near Twitter
6113780	6115780	Which is like okay?
6116300	6120780	Conversation over because what the fuck do I have left because I already go nowhere near reddit
6120780	6125380	I don't know where near tumblr go nowhere near anything so aside from just this thing of like
6126020	6130660	Don't just don't don't get online go fly a kite go climb a rock okay great
6130660	6136140	That was it. Yeah, then the good guys win like like like like when I'm like throwing a football in the yard and
6137180	6140580	dying of old age with my dogs are not online because
6141340	6148660	Like lately yeah, that's great. That's healthy the the and then it's like so then second to that is like well
6148660	6155180	Don't feed the trolls so that means okay. I know what that looks like that looks like me going every three hours
6155300	6156740	Hey
6156740	6158540	Sisos coming up
6158540	6164620	Project hey, here's an interview with me why not and then and then I just hire a publicist to just do that for me
6165220	6171380	Then they just go like so then I'm just another account that just goes like hey. Where are my tweeples at?
6173900	6175900	I'm about to eat a chocolate bar
6176260	6178260	Hashtag me if you love chocolate
6178380	6184020	And then everyone is just like meanwhile. I did they're just going like fuck you fat fucking fucking shit face
6184300	6190580	But but I'm not on Twitter, so then the publicist is just ignoring. They don't care and everybody everybody doesn't care. That's a great society
6190580	6191500	That's great
6191500	6193460	Lately like I shouldn't be angry
6193460	6199100	I shouldn't get mad about the idea that I was like born on the internet and watching it turn into this sewer
6199100	6205700	I shouldn't like I should never have like a fit of rage about this. That's not healthy that you should always be
6205980	6210660	Unaffected by everything you should just lie to people you should never tell anyone your feelings
6210660	6215180	You should never express your feelings. You shouldn't feel your feelings. You should hate the internet
6215180	6218980	You should all use the internet, but you should all hate it. We should all therefore
6219860	6224860	Simultaneously hate everything that we constantly do let's all live a fucking lie
6224940	6232460	Let's all twist ourselves into a balloon animal where we constantly think one thing and say another and we'll enforce it amongst ourselves
6232580	6237440	By judging everyone who accidentally says like this is fucking retarded
6237680	6244120	This is insane. You're being rude. You're a rude person. I don't like you. I'm having a bad day
6244120	6247940	I fucking hate you. You're stupid. You're a stupid person
6247940	6255120	You shouldn't value television this much and you shouldn't think that I'm an elected official to the point where you could like tweet me and let
6255120	6259360	Me know that I'm a bad person and then like I'd think that something's going to happen
6259800	6267280	Like like nothing's going to happen ever nothing's ever going to happen. It's never that's sad. That's a sad thing get angry
6267400	6270900	Get mad about that like that. Nothing will ever happen
6270900	6277160	You're just typing fuck you at Tom Hanks because you saw a TV guide that offended you did you that's what they want
6277360	6279840	Stop it get mad kill yourself
6281560	6284400	Okay, kill kill kill kill kill yourself just kill yourself
6285480	6288480	Not if anyone is listening is suicidal depressed. I'm not talking to you
6289880	6293280	Don't talk to somebody but I'm talking about the people that are never going to kill themselves
6295280	6297280	Telling them kill yourself
6298280	6299280	Start by start
6299280	6301840	You know what before you even get there dip a tippy toe in it
6301840	6308200	Just tweet like fucking like at yourself all this shit like scrutinize yourself say like I'm a shitty person
6309520	6316360	Like go you just go that's what there's no fucking door twitters for like fucking like type instead of like look scanning and going like

6329040	6335520	Look what you just did you contributed. I once tweeted something pretty biting at Ted Cruz
6336880	6344200	Nice, I hate that guy me too. It's a bad person. Yeah, it looks like he does stuff to kids
6346320	6349440	Have any of you seen him are you fucking kidding me?

6359200	6364400	Lot a lot I look like I love it I do look at me

6474320	6477960	I think I should kill myself and he's like don't don't do that
6479840	6486440	The world the world's counting on you that's like it's like getting a pep talk from Aubrey Plaza
6488520	6491960	It's like like I felt a bullet going faster out of the bullet I
6493240	6497920	Thought you said I had a cute voice. Well, I'd say it's adorable that your suits your soul
6498560	6502400	That I didn't realize how much of based on your voice. It was
6503400	6504840	All right
6504840	6508900	But then but then I make jokes about it. Then you start and he does don't kill yourself. Yeah
6510080	6514840	I love you. Then he's there. He's then he starts laughing and then he can't laugh because it hurts, too
6514840	6517280	Yeah, I always like that too. Is it bad? I mean like that
6517280	6520520	That's like you guys ever have a friend who like like because of some

6671920	6678080	Okay, okay, well obviously that's a compensation for the fact that without any props you look identical to a lesser author

6885920	6893840	After finding the stash of mp3s the team found themselves on the run from the law for the murder of an innocent security guard
6894280	6897400	But dr. Friend had a plan to shake their tail
6897880	6901640	Turn left there was the talk of a trip to Tacoma
6901640	6906480	But instead the car screeched its way back to Hank's last stand back at the bar
6906480	6909640	Eve haggled with Hank over the price of digital music
6910080	6915000	He what he said six but due to the possibility of seafood she heard eight
6915520	6921320	Wanting to get asses in all seats Hank agreed and the team was rewarded with the job done
6921320	6926340	Where will the runners head next will the budding love between friend and nightblade blossom?
6926340	6933900	Will they find the man who tried to pay them with a ghoul magnet find out now on a Harman thing I?
6934900	6939100	Got to say I listened to the last week's episode on the way here
6940620	6945100	And that kind of that seems like kind of an old night blade went to the bathroom
6946580	6948260	Hordegard lathered
6948260	6953060	Now we're caught up and then he said and then he said he found a map on the back of the soap
6953100	6958180	I mean allegedly he might have heard that well. Yeah, he's not allowed to do that stuff. That's what I said
6958180	6960180	And then Jeff said cliffhanger
6960940	6965580	Are you saying as the game master that there's no map well? I don't know let's ask hordegard
6965580	6967580	He's the one looking at the soap

6970460	6972020	Hello
6972020	6978340	What are you looking at that soap dispenser so intently? I have a sense about it. It feels
6980020	6982020	important
6983540	6991300	You were so chatty a minute ago, and yeah, it's a very engaging soap dispenser. I'm all about it
6993820	6999940	Can I attempt to mind link with the soap dispenser it does not have a mind okay?
7001420	7003420	Well now we know

7074400	7081080	We go around the bar and ask anybody if they need an adventure a task or anything I know that's that's that seems professional

7087520	7089440	leave the bathroom and
7089440	7094080	Suggest we maybe call hack I and see if he knows of any one in need

7146880	7148880	Shit
7149520	7152880	Outside you hear a car you hear a car pull up a
7153440	7161760	Car pulls up and into the bar walks a middle-aged blonde woman in a drab uniform the uniform of a corporate wage slave
7162400	7168120	She appears tired from the daily glonk grind and she seems to have gone a few days without sleep
7168120	7172000	She pulls up a chair and just holds up a hand and Hank gives her a drink
7172600	7173760	see
7173760	7175760	That's how you get a shadow run
7176760	7179920	All right, I gymnastics over to her
7184960	7186960	You
7187960	7192160	Use somersault that's that's that's the title. I think that's the title
7194720	7200600	Neatly over to her to rise to your feet at her side is she impressed
7200600	7206560	I'm impressed. She's startled I'd say more startled
7208400	7212040	What's your name? You don't know. Oh, don't you try talking to her?
7213840	7221400	Hey, hey, I'm real nervous. Why what's your name? My name is Peggy
7222800	7224640	All right
7224640	7226640	Sounds good to me. Yeah
7227440	7229960	Okay, I've not seen you around this bar before
7230840	7235760	This is our local watering hole and we get we get pretty drunk here all the time
7237000	7241400	Yeah, well, I come here a lot. So I don't I don't know. Let me touch the chase. I
7246040	7250760	Really want to fucking help you with something do you have any like secret missions?
7253520	7255520	Well, that's
7256640	7260720	That's just that's just uncanny
7264760	7270880	You know, I've been I've been busy lately I've been staying late at work and also my daughter's missing
7270880	7274240	It's just rough all over. Oh shit. Very the lead. Yeah
7275000	7276920	How old's your daughter?
7276920	7279000	34
7279000	7284080	14 you don't know your daughter's age. That's a little suspicious. You know, it's been it's been a couple months
7284960	7290320	Not since I've seen her since her birthday. It's hard to keep track. I can't I'm not following that
7290320	7296160	I cast analyze truth on her to see if she's telling the truth because that's a little weird
7298160	7299440	She's
7299440	7305280	Yeah, she's telling the truth. She's clearly she's clearly gone without sleep. She's a bit loopy or something
7305720	7307720	Something's off about her aura
7309040	7311360	Mind probe. Oh man
7314400	7316400	You
7317880	7324240	See all sorts of visions you see ghouls and support groups and therapy sessions and and
7324680	7329400	Daughters and child's toys all in a flash. It seems this lady
7329400	7335920	She's lost her daughter who is a victim of HM HVV. That means she's a ghoul and has to eat flesh
7336640	7342480	But she up and disappeared and it's extra scary because she might be shot to death cuz you know zombie
7344080	7346560	Well, I got a lot from that
7347960	7353200	But we don't know none of us this is horrifying. I feel like my mind was just violated randomly
7353600	7358000	It's not why I come to the bar your life's like an episode of Ninja Turtles
7358640	7360640	All right. I'll take your word for you
7363640	7367680	Sorry, that was probably me is that you feel that way
7371440	7373440	Next rounds on me
7374400	7376880	Well, yeah, we'll happily
7377800	7385040	Help you out with this situation. Listen, uh, what that's my friend Hordegarn. He's a psychic and hello
7386240	7389840	He was a pro probably probe in your mind. I don't know what he saw but he's right
7390560	7394160	us and like you do seem like a troubled person and
7395240	7399880	We are a crack troop of I guess what you'd call shadow runners. I
7400480	7404920	I give Jim that laid the thumbs up and I wink
7408640	7410120	Those
7410120	7414360	Yep, those things happen. So you have a missing daughter and
7415000	7421240	Again, forgive me for praying, but she is a ghoul. Oh, yeah. We have some experience with that and
7422040	7424040	ghoul magnets
7424600	7427800	So this one seems pretty cut and dry
7430280	7432280	Yeah
7437560	7439560	Yeah, yeah
7443560	7445560	I mean
7446760	7450960	Where did you last see her and let's get the magnet
7452880	7456520	You guys you left the magnet back at the thing I threw that through the man
7457400	7462840	I was angry at the time because it was a ghoul magnet. I I wasn't thinking maybe we need it
7463800	7466360	From mission hindsight 2020. Uh-huh
7467880	7472440	Regardless we're good enough to do it without the ghoul magnet. Oh shit
7473800	7475800	Do what?
7476600	7478600	Save your daughter lady
7479480	7484440	Sorry, this is very disorienting to have your mind read without saying anything. Hey, uh, dr
7484520	7487080	Friend, can you fucking like help this woman out from her?
7487720	7489720	Whatever just happened to her brain
7489960	7495480	Do you have a healing ability? What what does she need like some what do you need aspirin or something?
7497800	7499800	Just you know some space
7500280	7506200	Not to have my mind read and then just to have tons of people offering me all sorts of things
7506600	7508680	Well, let's uh, why don't we all like spread out?
7509480	7512280	Just gotta pretend that we're all at a bar alone together
7512920	7517240	And uh, give the lady some space. All right. I'll do that. But did I say sorry yet?
7518120	7524360	Probably. All right. Okay. Well, I give her space. Thank you. Did you did you say we're gonna save your daughter?
7525400	7528200	End of story. Let's fucking save this woman's daughter. Yeah
7528760	7530040	Oh, no
7530040	7532360	Okay, i'm just sorry. It's a little tantrum I throw
7533080	7535080	um, yeah, I mean
7535320	7537960	Look, uh, do you play uh darts anybody?
7538360	7539720	Oh
7539720	7541720	what's that and I just walk away because I
7542680	7547320	I'm not i'm not good at this and I just go and I get a drink and I go over to dr
7547320	7550040	Friend and I go jesus christ. We fucking suck at
7551240	7556920	Shadow running like we we're terrible at it. Like I know when mary odonnell walks in would it be creepy if I
7557720	7559720	sidled up next to her and
7560920	7562920	Bought her a drink
7563320	7566120	Try it been working long hours. Are you asking me?
7568280	7571720	I guess i'm asking the audience a classic ridley if I ever heard one
7572760	7575640	She seems put off by the fact that everyone's been sidling up to her
7577160	7583960	Like uh, but then again, I don't have any alternative suggestions. I mean i'm i'm i'm literally like fucking mannequins. What what?
7584840	7588760	What if we just ask her where was the last place you saw your daughter?
7589800	7591640	Oh, man
7591640	7598840	She used to be going to these these these support groups for zombies. I'm sorry. They're called hmh vv survivors
7599320	7601320	It's cool teaches them how to cope
7602120	7604920	She used to be going, you know, she went every week
7605080	7610600	She had a lot of good progress, but she didn't come back. Are they like in the basement of churches and stuff like that?
7610760	7612760	No, they they have their own storefronts
7613160	7617240	Like uh, like in like uh, you know like a real business like weight watchers
7617880	7620360	Do you know who has the sponsor of us?
7621000	7624360	No, no, none of that. All right, let's just what if we go there
7626120	7628120	Sorry, i'm a bad listener and I
7629560	7632680	Shit god damn it. You got this. Just just you got it
7637880	7639880	Excuse me for one second, ma'am
7641000	7643400	She said uh, she's her daughter went to a like a
7644120	7646120	Support group
7647640	7649400	She doesn't know which one
7649400	7653960	She was going to many she was going to all kinds of but she's a zombie. What was your favorite one?
7655560	7657720	She used to go to flesh to fresh but
7658440	7660440	Flesh to fresh up and left
7660760	7666920	Like went over to see if she was still there, you know, obviously that's the first place he goes the last place you saw
7667720	7672760	They said they didn't they didn't they didn't she wasn't there and then the next day place disappears
7673000	7677560	All right, the whole place just let's go there and look for clues. Hold on. Hold on. Would you just hold on a second?
7677560	7680040	It's not a shadow. Give us one second
7680840	7682840	What's wrong with you?
7682920	7688200	First of all, she's over eager. Well, she's she's she's she hasn't even given us a job. We don't even know if she can pay us
7689320	7693720	One of you guys must have a skill that that involves calming her down
7694120	7696840	Uh, well, I have the opposite of that we know that
7698200	7700440	I can impress her with a modern egg allergy
7704040	7706200	All right, well she we don't even notice she has any money
7708360	7711480	Jesus is that what this is about man? Yeah
