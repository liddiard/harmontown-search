0	18400	Hey everybody, welcome to the beautiful Dynasty typewriter, how's everybody doing tonight?
18400	22400	Harmontown is now in session!
22400	29400	You know what that means, let's give it up for our Dungeon Master, Spencer Crittenden!
31400	34400	I'm Rob Trapp, I'm controlling the night!
39400	41400	Thanks mom!
41400	47400	Let's give it up for the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!
48400	53400	Yeah! Dan Harmon! Yeah!
55400	64400	Thank you, thank you to my friends for showing up and supporting me.
64400	76400	Thank you, thank you to the audience for coming in and standing in line and buying a ticket at the right time.
76400	86400	Dan, it seems like back in the day you used to not come here the regular way, you used to come in a different way.
86400	92400	And now it just seems like every time you come this other way, what happened to us?
93400	104400	Damn, I want to bring that back till the break is gone, making love to you, damn!
107400	109400	Okay, alright.
112400	114400	What was the name of that song?
114400	117400	I don't know, back in the day.
117400	124400	Zero effort, lazy, lazy, lazy comedically, lazy creatively, lazy musically.
124400	126400	Lazy opener!
126400	137400	Yeah, but also kind of in a positive way, like rolling out into the ocean, like not a beached whale, the original whale to like become a whale.
137400	141400	After going like, I don't want to be a giant hippo.
141400	143400	There's no market for this.
143400	152400	I took a wrong turn at the Albuquerque of Darwinian progress, like I somehow am basically like a big blubbery pig on a beach.
152400	158400	If these giant ham hocks were flippers, I could be the most powerful fucker in the ocean.
158400	160400	I'm doing it, I'm going back.
160400	162400	Todd, don't!
162400	167400	Those are pre-whale, pre-aquatic whales.
168400	170400	Steve Levy, ice bucket!
173400	175400	Pre-whales.
175400	177400	Pre-whales.
177400	180400	I went back to the water whale that I am.
180400	182400	Hi Spencer!
182400	185400	I also went back to the water, hey guys.
189400	192400	Am I not supposed to interpret that as you implying that I am?
192400	195400	He's practicing, he needs to get in some errors.
195400	199400	Rob is practicing hosting because he's going to moderate...
199400	201400	Run a red lobster.
203400	205400	Table for five.
206400	208400	Follow that guy.
210400	212400	Yeah, pretty easy.
212400	214400	It doesn't seem that hard.
214400	219400	A lot of the work seems to be being done by that guy and even the customer.
219400	221400	Follow that guy.
221400	222400	It's a bit easy.
222400	224400	It's not too, it's a bit easy.
225400	226400	What is the deal with...
226400	233400	When you go into a restaurant that has a host and also waiter people,
233400	235400	is the host...
235400	237400	Is that a person?
237400	239400	Is it like the military?
239400	240400	It is a person.
240400	245400	Is it like the military where officer's school is different from enlisted men?
245400	249400	I was surprised to find out that never the twain shall meet.
249400	251400	Yeah, the hosts are on the fast track.
251400	253400	They get promoted to middle manager or whatever.
253400	254400	They've never scrubbed a dish.
254400	255400	Possibly.
255400	256400	Some of them have, some of them haven't.
256400	257400	But at any rate, that's not really...
257400	259400	They're like, I'd like to host.
259400	263400	Well, I believe that host is usually where you start and then you work up to waiter
263400	265400	because then you get tips.
265400	268400	Oh, the host is more like a shadow program.
268400	269400	Yeah, I think.
269400	272400	Like Wonder Mutt in the Hall of Justice.
272400	274400	Host is Wonder Mutt, yeah.
274400	275400	Oh, okay.
275400	277400	I understand that sound you made.
277400	282400	Well, because you're picturing a laborer and now I'm comparing them to an animal.
282400	283400	Yes.
283400	286400	But what an animal.
286400	289400	His first name is Wonder.
289400	290400	Yeah, exactly.
290400	295400	I was more thinking in terms of the strata, like where you start and you're kind of in
295400	297400	training because you're kind of like hanging back.
297400	303400	But when you're the customer, you're perceiving the host as like some kind of...
303400	305400	Like they have power over things.
305400	306400	I don't know.
306400	307400	Or at least I did.
307400	309400	Yeah, they have a power over hospitality.
309400	313400	Like they're welcoming you and it feels like it's their place.
313400	316400	But no, they can't even wait.
316400	322400	I'm very conscious of my body today.
322400	324400	I was inventorying my mood.
324400	326400	That's a new word, inventorying.
326400	334400	And I was like, I think maybe consciousness of your body should be like a mood.
334400	337400	It's like sometimes you just feel...
337400	339400	There's nothing you're gonna be able to do.
339400	346400	Sometimes you feel a little handsome.
346400	347400	That's not...
347400	349400	No, I did a little bit there at the end.
349400	350400	I riffed.
350400	353400	I was like, go 90 degrees now.
353400	355400	Because what are you doing?
355400	357400	You're telling them you feel fat?
357400	359400	What is your show and who are you?
359400	361400	Why are you talking into a microphone?
361400	362400	Who are they?
362400	364400	What are they supposed to think about themselves?
364400	371400	We're gonna answer all these questions tonight on Dan Harmon's Hormontown.
371400	374400	So, yeah.
374400	375400	Yeah.
375400	379400	So Rob's gonna be moderating the Rick and Wernie Comic Con panel.
379400	383400	And so he wants to practice hosting.
383400	390400	Yeah, I want to practice and I don't want it to turn into Hormontown.
390400	393400	Because no one wins that way.
393400	394400	But you want to...
394400	396400	Well, yeah.
396400	398400	And you picked a great place to practice.
398400	399400	Well, no, no.
399400	401400	No, hear me out.
401400	403400	I'm usually not controlling.
403400	404400	I'm usually here.
404400	406400	And I usually come out and you ignore me.
406400	410400	And the only way I'm gonna make it worth my drive here is pissing you off.
410400	414400	So if I'm controlling, I'm kind of...
414400	416400	I have a job to do.
416400	418400	You've said hi to me tonight.
418400	420400	So, you know, bonus.
420400	421400	Win.
421400	422400	Win.
422400	423400	Win.
423400	426400	I've got so much win.
426400	427400	It is different.
427400	428400	Maybe I just think...
428400	435400	Maybe I'm an elitist and I think of hosts differently than guests and busboys.
435400	437400	Like, I'm like...
437400	440400	Like, it's connected.
440400	443400	I'm thinking the same thing at Abenegans as I am in my stagecraft,
443400	445400	which is that hosts are important.
445400	448400	You've done how many Comic-Con panels?
448400	450400	Let's be serious for a second.
450400	451400	I don't know.
451400	453400	Okay, so probably...
453400	454400	There's been like, what?
454400	455400	Three Rick and Morty ones.
455400	456400	There's been a bunch for community.
456400	458400	And then, yeah, about three or four committees.
458400	460400	Let's just talk about Rick and Morty, okay?
460400	461400	Just talk about...
461400	462400	Okay, all right.
462400	463400	Well, I'll go four.
463400	465400	I just think Rick and Morty probably have four big panels.
465400	468400	Okay, what are some do's and don'ts?
468400	469400	Give me...
469400	472400	Start with the do's.
472400	474400	Go.
474400	477400	Number one.
477400	482400	Well, I think that big crowd dynamics in general,
482400	485400	but you and I wrote on award shows together.
485400	487400	Want an Emmy?
487400	488400	Uh, kid.
488400	491400	But, you know, and so you're familiar with the kind...
491400	493400	I don't have to advise you on this,
493400	497400	but it's like Hall H is like 3,000 people, like, or 6,000?
497400	499400	How many does Hall H hold?
499400	500400	Many, many thousands.
500400	501400	I don't think that'll be a problem.
501400	502400	My voice kind of carries.
502400	504400	But, you know, crowds are different.
504400	507400	Like, 150 people, like, they...
507400	510400	It's like you could get a laugh off of clearing your throat
510400	512400	at the right time or taking the right pause
512400	513400	and there's an interface,
513400	516400	and then the larger the crowd gets, it's not...
516400	517400	They're dumber.
517400	520400	It's just that they're kind of wearing gloves
520400	523400	on their feelings, so, like, you're...
523400	524400	It just...
524400	526400	People make the mistake of thinking that that means
526400	528400	that you have to dumb everything down.
528400	530400	It's very close to that, but I...
531400	532400	It's not...
532400	534400	I think that's a negative thing,
534400	537400	to think that 3,000 people aren't smarter
537400	541400	than 150 people, but just in a different way.
541400	542400	They're, like...
542400	543400	Yeah.
543400	544400	They're...
544400	547400	And that you're dealing with, like, a kind of, like,
547400	551400	more of an on-off, like, Frankenstein switch
551400	553400	than a light switch in terms of, like...
553400	556400	You want to, like, be big and crisp with your...
556400	559400	Hey, who here wants to react to the word sandwich?
560400	562400	And then they'll...
562400	564400	And then you're, like...
564400	566400	You know, well, then in a black case,
566400	568400	it's just more of a big...
568400	571400	It's a bigger, simpler, but more powerful machine.
571400	572400	Right, right, right.
572400	575400	Is there anybody here going to Comic-Con this year?
575400	576400	Anybody?
577400	578400	Two people.
578400	579400	Two people.
579400	580400	All right.
580400	581400	We'll see you there.
581400	583400	In this room, that's riveting.
585400	587400	Maybe they've seen you enough.
588400	589400	Yeah.
589400	590400	So...
590400	593400	And then let's segue into...
593400	595400	One of your jobs is going to be to introduce everybody.
595400	596400	Right.
596400	599400	Is there a story of somebody not doing that right?
600400	601400	No.
601400	602400	No.
602400	603400	No.
603400	604400	We...
604400	606400	Didn't Ryan Ridley come out dressed like...
606400	609400	You guys remember Ryan Ridley?
609400	610400	Well, I will...
610400	611400	Two people.
611400	612400	I will let Ryan Ridley...
612400	614400	I think we've already talked about it on the show.
614400	615400	Okay, never mind.
615400	617400	Ryan does a great job of explaining...
617400	618400	Okay, never mind.
618400	619400	Never mind.
619400	620400	I watched it online.
620400	623400	It was way funnier than you told it.
623400	624400	Because it's...
624400	625400	Ryan...
625400	626400	Ryan...
626400	628400	For those of you who don't know what we're talking about,
628400	631400	Ryan Ridley, who was a writer on Rick and Morty, came out.
631400	632400	He moderated.
632400	637400	And he dressed up like a king of whatever...
637400	641400	He was a king, but like a king from a pack of cards almost.
641400	642400	Right.
642400	645400	He didn't like go, oh, I'm gonna make a crown,
645400	648400	and I'm gonna get like my shitty wig or whatever.
648400	650400	He spent some time on this costume.
650400	653400	And then he comes out and he...
653400	655400	And it's a huge room.
655400	657400	So the silence is deafening.
657400	660400	So he comes out and he's like...
661400	662400	Rob's smiling.
662400	665400	Expecting people to be laughing already.
665400	666400	And it's...
666400	667400	He sits there for a long time.
667400	670400	Because the joke was that it's a brilliant joke, right?
670400	671400	Ryan's very...
671400	672400	He's a genius.
672400	676400	The joke was that Game of Thrones panel was after ours,
676400	680400	and he was just there to kill the time
680400	683400	like the audience was waiting for...
683400	687400	He took the moderating gig so he could be at the Game of Thrones panel.
687400	688400	It didn't go over well.
688400	690400	Well, because again, he looked like a deck of cards
690400	693400	and he never said who he was.
693400	695400	He never said...
695400	699400	He didn't really kind of set up the bit for it to land.
699400	702400	And also, after it kind of hit the skids,
702400	704400	my memory is that he also never at any point said,
704400	706400	by the way, my name is Ryan Ridley.
706400	707400	I work on the show.
707400	709400	I'm responsible for you.
709400	710400	I'm moderating right now.
710400	713400	You like me, you just don't know.
713400	715400	Because a lot of the panels will be moderated
715400	719400	by some guy from Buzzfeed or something.
719400	721400	I'm not diminishing that.
721400	723400	It's just that people are used to in those halls
723400	725400	with like, we don't...
725400	728400	This person may be good at this job, bad at this job.
728400	730400	Inevitably, who cares?
730400	734400	Because what is being good or bad at that job?
734400	736400	When the people are like...
736400	739400	I just think the people are there to like...
739400	744400	I don't want to use the word worship because we tend to punish...
744400	746400	I don't know.
746400	750400	We have a negative view of fandom in general kind of still.
750400	753400	But Comic-Con is a mecca.
753400	755400	They've journeyed there, blah, blah, blah.
755400	759400	The Kool-Aid is real.
759400	762400	The Kool-Aid doesn't kill you.
762400	764400	It's just good to drink it.
764400	766400	Because it's Kool-Aid, it tastes great.
766400	768400	The people are in this room of like,
768400	772400	at least we can all fucking express that we love The Simpsons
772400	775400	for the next 45 minutes without loving it wrong
775400	778400	or like someone letting us know that it was ugly
778400	780400	the way we liked The Simpsons.
780400	782400	There's something really powerful about that
782400	784400	that probably is the same thing going on
784400	786400	with Grateful Dead Concert, Burning Man, whatever.
786400	791400	Why am I explaining audiences?
791400	794400	Why don't we practice bringing people out?
794400	797400	Because that's the moderator thing.
797400	800400	They're like there and they're like,
800400	802400	who does this guy think he is?
802400	805400	That meter's running.
805400	810400	But according to you, there's no way I can screw this up.
810400	813400	Well, what about...
813400	816400	You're saying, who cares?
816400	820400	So I should just go on and be myself.
820400	822400	Oh, yeah, they'll love that.
822400	823400	Why don't you bring someone out?
823400	825400	Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
825400	830400	from his tour of America
830400	836400	is Jeff Brian Davis from Whose Line Is It Anyway?
840400	842400	Welcome back.
842400	847400	This is Jeff Davis' first win.
847400	851400	He's been on many different episodes of this podcast.
851400	854400	Jeff Davis. Jeff Davis.
854400	856400	Jeff Davis is now doing...
856400	860400	Oh, no. Oh, damn.
860400	863400	Okay, okay, okay, all right. All right.
863400	867400	They just made out.
867400	870400	No, no.
870400	873400	I'm not kissing you.
873400	875400	Oh, okay.
875400	878400	Well, if you're going to do it that way.
878400	880400	That's like the fifth time I've made out
880400	883400	with a man for comedy in 20 years.
883400	886400	But it's all potent now.
886400	888400	I'm like...
888400	890400	The whole time I was going,
890400	892400	oh, is there such a thing called...
892400	894400	Is there gay face now?
894400	896400	Jeff Davis, what do you think?
896400	898400	Is there gay face?
898400	901400	Hey, that's a great interviewing question.
901400	902400	Thank you.
902400	904400	You are fucking ready to go.
904400	907400	Um, you know, I've been rehearsing.
907400	910400	Yeah, the pump has been primed. You are ready.
910400	911400	But I was also distracted by your tender...
911400	913400	Oh, wow. Your tender lips.
913400	916400	It was... I loved kissing.
916400	919400	It got kind of good there.
919400	920400	I was like, I'd do this.
920400	922400	There was a moment when we crossed...
922400	923400	I mean, I don't know about you.
923400	925400	I felt we crossed the threshold
925400	928400	into kind of a...
928400	929400	Like a...
929400	930400	A real thing.
930400	931400	Yeah.
931400	933400	Expressing affection for each other.
933400	935400	I don't think I've ever felt the tender touch
935400	937400	of another human being in the way
937400	940400	that we experienced that just now.
940400	941400	Okay, good. Same page close.
941400	945400	Also, if you spend $5, you can see this
945400	947400	for the subscription for the moment.
947400	948400	Yeah, yeah.
948400	952400	You can see Dan and me make up.
952400	954400	We never said anything during all of Pride Month,
954400	955400	by the way.
955400	956400	We miss Pride Month.
956400	957400	I don't know.
957400	960400	We'll say it now.
960400	962400	I want to remind people that remember our guest,
962400	963400	David Cummings.
963400	964400	He is...
964400	968400	Pride Month continues to be really strongly celebrated
968400	971400	in horror fiction podcasts.
971400	972400	I'll just say the No Sleep podcast.
972400	975400	They just do a fucking great job
975400	979400	of rolling out the LGBTQ carpet while without...
979400	980400	And it's like...
980400	983400	You feel like you've done something
983400	985400	for anyone by listening,
985400	987400	but you also feel like you're cheating
987400	988400	because you're like...
988400	989400	But it's better.
989400	991400	These stories about...
991400	993400	Stories from gay couple perspectives
993400	995400	that are about not...
995400	998400	That are about a hook coming through a window
998400	999400	are like...
999400	1001400	It's more compelling.
1001400	1003400	It's better horror.
1003400	1006400	Rob, do you have a follow-up question for that?
1006400	1008400	Where did the hook come from?
1008400	1009400	I don't know.
1009400	1011400	I got hyped before the show.
1011400	1015400	The hook coming from the window is a cool idea.
1015400	1017400	So what do you...
1017400	1020400	Rob, do you want to pretend it's a panel
1020400	1022400	and get real hands-on practice there?
1022400	1024400	Yeah, do you want to do some real...
1024400	1025400	I guess.
1025400	1026400	Are we pretending that...
1026400	1028400	Do you want to try pandering?
1028400	1029400	Let's say...
1029400	1030400	Get some pandering in.
1030400	1033400	Dan or Spencer, why don't you pitch me
1033400	1037400	as a panelist like someone that Rob has to interview
1037400	1038400	on the panel.
1038400	1039400	All right.
1039400	1040400	And I'll be that person.
1040400	1042400	Rob, what do you think about this?
1042400	1046400	Jeff is the guy who plays Morty.
1049400	1051400	Okay, so Justin...
1051400	1052400	Yeah.
1052400	1053400	Okay.
1053400	1057400	So what's the nastiest,
1057400	1059400	sickest,
1059400	1061400	sexiest,
1061400	1063400	like,
1063400	1064400	most,
1064400	1065400	like,
1065400	1070400	offensive thing that ever happened behind the scenes
1070400	1073400	at Rick and Morty?
1073400	1076400	Oh, well, one time,
1076400	1078400	we were in the edit bay.
1078400	1079400	We were in the edit bay,
1079400	1083400	and Dan came in to the edit bay with me,
1083400	1089400	and we just started really, really getting on each other's balls.
1089400	1093400	And I mean, like, not in a kissy, touchy way,
1093400	1096400	but we really got on each other's balls.
1096400	1097400	Yeah.
1097400	1102400	And that's how we broke season four.
1102400	1103400	Wow.
1103400	1106400	Is that why the show takes so long to make?
1106400	1108400	Yeah, that's another thing you want to hit a lot.
1108400	1110400	What's the show coming out?
1110400	1112400	What's taking so long?
1112400	1113400	What's the show coming out?
1113400	1114400	What would be the best...
1114400	1117400	Why is it so hard to make the damn show?
1117400	1118400	Yeah.
1118400	1120400	Where are you at right now, Harmon?
1120400	1123400	You and Justin, like, where...
1123400	1126400	In your 70 episode Odyssey.
1126400	1129400	70 episodes.
1129400	1131400	I don't like 70 anything.
1131400	1132400	How are you...
1132400	1133400	Where are you?
1133400	1134400	Three, five...
1134400	1136400	I mean, what the fuck are you gonna do?
1136400	1137400	What the fuck are you faking?
1137400	1138400	What the fuck?
1138400	1140400	You bought a house with a giant pool.
1140400	1141400	Jesus.
1141400	1142400	You're gonna fucking die broke.
1142400	1143400	Oh, my God.
1143400	1144400	You shined paperwork.
1144400	1147400	There's no way that this is even humanly possible.
1147400	1148400	Do you know?
1148400	1150400	And if it is, it's not even gonna be good.
1150400	1151400	Do you know?
1151400	1152400	It's gonna be shit.
1152400	1153400	Yeah.
1153400	1154400	A, B, C...
1154400	1157400	And this is Justin Roiland saying that.
1163400	1164400	I noticed...
1164400	1165400	Here's something.
1165400	1166400	Oh, here we go.
1166400	1167400	Okay, I'm breaking the shit.
1167400	1168400	This is me just...
1168400	1169400	Break it down.
1169400	1176400	I was looking at other Qs and A panels, and I noticed...
1176400	1177400	You're already doing your homework.
1177400	1178400	He really is.
1178400	1181400	Well, I don't phone anything in.
1186400	1188400	Rob gave an insulting response to a high-five.
1188400	1189400	Except for high-fives.
1189400	1191400	He will phone in a high-five.
1191400	1193400	Well, I cut my finger.
1193400	1194400	Oh, okay.
1194400	1195400	You don't want to give me your AIDS.
1195400	1197400	But you could make me feel that.
1197400	1198400	Rob has AIDS.
1198400	1199400	It's okay.
1199400	1200400	We could talk about it.
1200400	1201400	It's adorable.
1202400	1207400	I noticed that your fans don't audition when they ask questions.
1207400	1210400	Usually, like, when I've done panels, it's usually like...
1210400	1211400	They have good fans.
1211400	1213400	Hello there.
1213400	1214400	Just...
1214400	1216400	One is new.
1216400	1218400	And then they do, like, this very...
1218400	1222400	They've been rehearsing this bit, and then it comes off very...
1222400	1224400	Like, the whole audience goes, what?
1224400	1225400	Or whatever.
1225400	1229400	But your fans, Rick and Morning fans, they're like,
1229400	1230400	why did Doc do this?
1230400	1232400	Or what's in this bottle?
1232400	1236400	Are those both trash cans from the Smith House?
1236400	1237400	Or did he steal those?
1237400	1238400	Or what...
1238400	1240400	You know, like, they have very specific questions,
1240400	1241400	which...
1241400	1243400	Kind of cool, right?
1243400	1245400	I mean, that's not really a question.
1245400	1246400	Yeah.
1246400	1247400	But this is a...
1247400	1249400	I don't know if you've noticed that.
1249400	1250400	I think there's...
1250400	1252400	Well, I guess I haven't is my answer,
1252400	1255400	because I've only done panels for Community and Rick and Morty,
1255400	1256400	and I don't...
1256400	1258400	There's not a lot of, like...
1258400	1262400	I think there's, like, a self-policing kind of enzyme in the air.
1262400	1265400	People that might otherwise...
1265400	1270400	Like, they want to contribute to, like, this very short run time.
1270400	1273400	You know, they don't want to be the one that asks the question
1273400	1278400	that causes other people a problem of some kind.
1278400	1279400	Like, there's a lot of pressure.
1279400	1282400	Like, you're lining up to ask your question into the mic.
1282400	1286400	And every once in a while, there's people that take a shot at the moon
1286400	1291400	with some kind of larger than just a regular question bit.
1291400	1295400	But, like, 80% of those actually work.
1295400	1296400	Like, they're good.
1296400	1298400	Like, if somebody is just, like, in a costume and they go,
1298400	1299400	like, I have one question.
1299400	1300400	Yeah.
1300400	1301400	When am I coming back?
1301400	1303400	And it's like, oh, Bluto.
1303400	1305400	Next season, when Popeye gets super...
1305400	1308400	Guy dressed up as Mr. Poopy Butthole and asks Sarah, like,
1308400	1310400	why'd you shoot me?
1310400	1311400	Right.
1311400	1313400	That's funny.
1313400	1314400	The audience loved it.
1314400	1315400	Yeah.
1315400	1317400	So, who's going to be on the panel?
1317400	1318400	Who's on the dais?
1318400	1320400	I think Dan is, right?
1320400	1323400	You're going to show up for that, right?
1323400	1324400	Yeah.
1324400	1326400	If I'm feeling better about my body, yeah.
1326400	1327400	Okay.
1327400	1330400	But just do head and shoulders with the camera.
1330400	1332400	There's mirrors all over the green room.
1332400	1333400	And it's just kind of like...
1333400	1336400	And it's just one of those, like...
1336400	1338400	I think it's like a biorhythmic thing.
1338400	1341400	Like, my body doesn't look any different to...
1342400	1343400	But I just like...
1343400	1349400	My t-shirt's like a tarp, like, laid over this bowling pin.
1349400	1350400	That's that guy.
1350400	1354400	Made of, like, softening candle wax and, like...
1354400	1355400	That sounds like a lyric.
1355400	1357400	And I'll look in the mirror and I'll go, like,
1357400	1359400	hey, fix that posture.
1359400	1363400	And then I'll go like this, and it gets really depressing
1363400	1368400	because it's like, ah, a fucking monster with good posture.
1368400	1371400	Like, your belly didn't change shape at all.
1371400	1374400	It just, like, moved on the y-axis.
1374400	1377400	Have you been backsliding with your Dave Planet workouts?
1377400	1378400	I don't know.
1378400	1379400	No, certainly...
1379400	1383400	Well, maybe yes, but not through his fault.
1383400	1385400	But, you know, there's been...
1385400	1390400	Yeah, I'm sure it's like I'm sliding in a way
1390400	1392400	that I'm maybe noticing or whatever, yeah.
1392400	1393400	I mean, I don't want to...
1393400	1395400	Hey, hey.
1395400	1396400	Ease up.
1396400	1397400	I'm controlling.
1398400	1400400	I did want to...
1400400	1402400	Hey, you didn't answer that question.
1402400	1403400	I'm going to get to the truth.
1403400	1405400	Who's on the panel?
1405400	1406400	You are, Justin.
1406400	1407400	Dude, I don't know.
1407400	1408400	Gee, I don't know.
1408400	1410400	Yeah, I don't actually know.
1413400	1414400	Another voice talent?
1414400	1416400	Is it not like Ryan Ridley?
1416400	1418400	I would assume that it's...
1418400	1419400	Ryan Ridley will be there.
1419400	1421400	Some voice people.
1421400	1422400	Voice people.
1422400	1424400	But I don't know how they pick them in voice people.
1424400	1426400	Yeah, it's probably gonna be Chris and Sarah
1426400	1428400	and Spencer, right?
1428400	1430400	I would, you know, yeah.
1430400	1432400	Probably.
1432400	1433400	Not me.
1435400	1438400	But I would hate to be wrong about that.
1438400	1439400	All right, well...
1439400	1440400	Yeah, I said probably.
1440400	1441400	Somebody will be there.
1441400	1444400	Rob, Rob, if you could ask one question.
1444400	1445400	Right.
1445400	1446400	What would it be?
1446400	1448400	Dan, are you coming into work tomorrow?
1450400	1451400	Yeah.
1451400	1452400	Good. I like it when you're there.
1452400	1453400	Yeah.
1453400	1454400	We got a lot done today.
1454400	1457400	We got a lot done today.
1457400	1459400	Kind of two, almost two episodes.
1459400	1460400	The show.
1460400	1461400	Almost two stories broken.
1461400	1462400	Yeah.
1462400	1463400	Are you working on it?
1463400	1465400	I think I am.
1465400	1467400	I wouldn't call it working.
1467400	1468400	Hello.
1468400	1470400	He has his moments.
1470400	1472400	Are you a writer, producer?
1472400	1473400	What are you doing?
1473400	1474400	I'm not sure.
1474400	1478400	I just show up until they tell me to get the fuck out.
1478400	1480400	I don't really know.
1480400	1482400	We're communicating in this language in the writer's room
1482400	1484400	where it's like an old married couple.
1484400	1486400	And it's like, I don't...
1486400	1490400	I assume it's bad for the other people.
1490400	1491400	Why would that...
1491400	1495400	Because there's a show runner and kind of guy that's
1495400	1496400	deputized.
1496400	1499400	His job is to keep the trains running on time.
1499400	1500400	But it's like...
1500400	1502400	But he can't fire me.
1502400	1503400	And then he's like...
1503400	1506400	And then I'm just doing this bit with Schwab all the time.
1506400	1508400	I'll be like, okay, well, what if...
1508400	1510400	What if the spacesuit had a thing?
1510400	1513400	What if it had a thing?
1513400	1515400	Don't fucking question me.
1515400	1518400	If you have something to contribute, fucking pitch something
1518400	1520400	or otherwise shut the fuck up.
1520400	1525400	I'm just trying to help, man.
1525400	1528400	If you want to help, pitch something.
1528400	1530400	I pitched something the fuck a couple minutes ago.
1530400	1532400	Your pitch was a question.
1532400	1539400	It was like, why isn't Rick Morty?
1539400	1540400	That was a bitch!
1540400	1542400	No, that was a question.
1542400	1543400	For a really long time.
1543400	1544400	Anyways, it's center.
1544400	1545400	And it's like...
1545400	1546400	It's kind of like...
1546400	1548400	It's just a 40 year...
1548400	1549400	What?
1549400	1550400	30 years?
1550400	1551400	It's just a...
1551400	1553400	How much does a job pay?
1553400	1557400	I'll let you know at the end of the month.
1557400	1559400	And I do have to wonder, like, what...
1559400	1561400	Are you making a living doing this?
1561400	1564400	I hope so.
1564400	1566400	Kate's gonna be really pissed.
1566400	1569400	What about the younger writers that are like,
1569400	1570400	fuck, man.
1570400	1572400	You get up in the morning and they're like...
1572400	1573400	I went to Harvard.
1573400	1574400	What the fuck is going on right now?
1574400	1575400	They're like, so wait.
1575400	1576400	So what?
1576400	1577400	What is this?
1577400	1578400	I spent six years at The Onion.
1578400	1580400	And now this is...
1580400	1586400	He just wanted his husband at work?
1586400	1588400	He just got tired of...
1588400	1590400	But they're coming around.
1590400	1591400	They realize that's how we work.
1591400	1593400	And we do...
1593400	1595400	We did a good job today.
1595400	1596400	Yeah, but, well, I wonder...
1596400	1601400	My mind goes back to the note we would get in Milwaukee
1601400	1605400	from the improv community.
1605400	1606400	Conference ports or did LS?
1606400	1610400	Well, I mean, I feel like we got the same note in both,
1610400	1612400	which goes to show you that we had the problem,
1612400	1615400	because one was like...
1615400	1616400	They were very different from each other,
1616400	1620400	but they both would express to us, basically, like,
1620400	1621400	in the politest way.
1621400	1625400	It would be nice when you guys are doing something
1625400	1628400	if you would let people know what it is
1628400	1633400	and how they can help and not just make...
1633400	1639400	Latch onto each other and make fun of everything around you
1639400	1643400	in some heavenly creatures, like, twisted.
1643400	1648400	Two British girls fantasizing about homicide in the 50s,
1648400	1651400	kind of like vibe you give off.
1651400	1654400	It's like all of a sudden just talking in diehard references
1654400	1658400	and there's like, you know, a referee going,
1658400	1660400	I don't want...
1660400	1662400	So you recreated diehard?
1662400	1664400	That's not the theater game.
1664400	1666400	All right.
1666400	1670400	I remember when I first met you, was it like 94?
1670400	1672400	Probably, yeah.
1672400	1675400	Milwaukee Comedy Sports Tournament.
1675400	1678400	And I had been in L.A. comedy sports for like,
1678400	1680400	I think like six months.
1680400	1682400	I was pretty new.
1682400	1684400	And I'd heard about the New York comedy sports guys,
1684400	1688400	like Tomlin and Mike Rock and all the other guys.
1688400	1691400	And then you guys, the Dead L Wives,
1691400	1693400	and I was so intimidated to meet you,
1693400	1696400	and we all like met and wanted to hang out with each other,
1696400	1698400	but we never really talked.
1698400	1701400	We just kind of stared at our feet and had a drink.
1701400	1704400	But then I saw you guys do the Dead L Wives show.
1704400	1706400	And it fucking blew my mind.
1706400	1708400	It was really...
1708400	1710400	Oh, you can be funny and weird
1710400	1713400	and not give a fuck about the audience.
1713400	1716400	Because you guys truly didn't care about the quality,
1716400	1718400	what was going on.
1718400	1720400	But that's why it was funny.
1720400	1722400	You cared about quality in the right way,
1722400	1725400	which is like, we're going to do what we want.
1725400	1727400	It's not meant to rehearse.
1727400	1731400	We didn't have any option of pleasing the audience.
1731400	1734400	We wouldn't know how, so...
1734400	1736400	But you were signing like Scud books,
1736400	1738400	and I think that's when I first met you.
1738400	1740400	You were sitting at a little table,
1740400	1742400	and you were signing Scud, but I didn't know what that was.
1742400	1744400	Most people don't.
1744400	1745400	Right.
1745400	1746400	All right.
1746400	1749400	It's time for a segment.
1749400	1751400	Oh, shit.
1751400	1753400	One of your jobs as a host will be to deal with segments.
1753400	1754400	Okay.
1754400	1756400	And since you didn't bring music,
1756400	1757400	you have to sing.
1757400	1760400	If you want to add a musical sting to it...
1760400	1761400	It doesn't help me.
1761400	1763400	It's time for Spencer to update us
1763400	1766400	on my backyard bee problem.
1766400	1767400	Oh, okay.
1767400	1772400	When it's time for Spencer to update you on the bees.
1772400	1774400	Oh, thank you, Zach.
1774400	1777400	Four wings, six legs.
1777400	1780400	Do you guys remember when we tried really hard...
1780400	1782400	I said musical sting.
1782400	1784400	That was a... Okay.
1784400	1787400	And I don't think that got the full credit it deserves.
1787400	1789400	Okay.
1789400	1790400	Go ahead, Robert.
1790400	1791400	What were you going to say?
1791400	1793400	Do you remember when we spent, like, an afternoon
1793400	1797400	trying to break or figure out, like,
1797400	1803400	how to do the Austin Powers as a bee movie?
1803400	1806400	We came up with, do I make you honey, bee bee?
1806400	1808400	Oh, my God.
1808400	1809400	Wait, wow.
1809400	1810400	Oh, bee hive.
1810400	1811400	Oh, bee hive.
1811400	1812400	Bee hive.
1812400	1814400	Oh, bee hive.
1814400	1816400	And we were, like, cackling, but we were just like,
1816400	1817400	what would we call it?
1817400	1819400	What would we call Austin Pollen?
1819400	1821400	Austin Pollen.
1821400	1825400	It's not nearly as good as, oh, bee hive.
1825400	1826400	Buzz-ten...
1826400	1828400	Buzz-ten...
1828400	1829400	Bee hive.
1829400	1830400	Buzz-ten Pollen.
1830400	1831400	Oh, bee hive.
1831400	1833400	Oh, bee hive.
1833400	1836400	Do I make you honey, bee bee?
1836400	1840400	Oh, do I make you honey?
1840400	1842400	Honey, make a sting and walk down.
1842400	1844400	Do I make you honey, baby?
1844400	1845400	Do I make you honey, bee bee?
1846400	1851400	Who was there when we did seven hours at the rustic in about,
1851400	1854400	I just got back from so-and-so and my boy on my arm was tired.
1854400	1855400	Were you there for that one?
1855400	1856400	No, I wasn't there.
1856400	1858400	You were there.
1858400	1859400	Dan?
1859400	1860400	No, I don't.
1860400	1861400	Okay.
1861400	1865400	I was there when we spent seven hours reenacting what the first
1865400	1867400	submarine was like.
1870400	1872400	When the people built the submarine and they go,
1872400	1874400	okay, we're going to have to get our best...
1874400	1875400	We have to do what?
1875400	1878400	We have to get our best sailors.
1878400	1880400	We have to get everybody that does.
1880400	1883400	And we're going to put them in a lead tube and sink it.
1883400	1885400	I mean, their job is to keep the boat up.
1885400	1889400	And then I go, well, we can't tell them until it sinks.
1889400	1894400	And so we kept redoing the, like, you're going to love it.
1894400	1897400	You son of a bitch, I'd fucking kill you.
1897400	1899400	Let me have this goddamn thing.
1899400	1900400	Hear me out.
1900400	1903400	You're going to love what this submarine does.
1903400	1905400	Jesus Christ, you bastard.
1905400	1907400	You've murdered it.
1907400	1910400	You've murdered all of us.
1910400	1913400	Corporal, submarine corporal.
1913400	1914400	Submarine corporal.
1914400	1919400	The Navy has trained these men their entire lives to value...
1919400	1920400	On top of the water.
1920400	1921400	Buoyancy.
1921400	1922400	On top of the water.
1922400	1925400	You're asking them to go against everything.
1925400	1927400	We're called sailors, not seekers.
1927400	1930400	We've got to keep it a secret or it's not going to work.
1930400	1932400	You son of a bitch.
1932400	1935400	You guys, you're bad now, but you're not going to thank me later.
1935400	1938400	It's like getting BA on a plane in the A-Team.
1938400	1940400	I don't fly, Hannibal.
1940400	1947400	BA, we can't take a jeep to deal with killer ants in the Yucatan.
1947400	1948400	I don't care, sucker.
1948400	1950400	I pity the fool that tries to make me fly.
1950400	1953400	And then they're like, okay, have a glass of milk, Mr. T.
1953400	1954400	You love it.
1954400	1957400	And it's like, that's what they had to do with the sailors.
1957400	1960400	They're like, you'll thank us at the fucking nautical Emmys.
1961400	1963400	Who is the first...
1963400	1968400	I know that there was the first people that tried to make a submersible thing.
1968400	1970400	They were crazy people.
1970400	1971400	They had to be German.
1971400	1974400	The first time you built a U-boat or a submarine
1974400	1978400	and you put a bunch of fuckers on that thing, that's crazy.
1978400	1979400	That's murder.
1979400	1980400	Oh, man.
1980400	1983400	Gentlemen, your job is to sink.
1983400	1984400	Yeah.
1984400	1985400	Your job is to be...
1985400	1986400	Are you fucking kidding me?
1986400	1987400	This boat is made to sink?
1987400	1989400	I'm not coming near it.
1989400	1990400	Guys, don't worry.
1990400	1991400	We've packed...
1991400	1994400	30% of this boat is packed with baking soda.
1994400	1998400	Can I ask a little bit, Admiral?
1998400	2001400	My name is Ensign Davis.
2001400	2004400	I'm noticing there's no sails on this boat.
2004400	2005400	Yeah, it was...
2005400	2006400	I believe...
2006400	2008400	I made me wrong about this.
2008400	2011400	There's probably historians in the audience and things in there.
2011400	2016400	But I know there is a story about the Civil War.
2017400	2020400	I think they were Confederates, if you can believe that.
2020400	2023400	Those little dickens.
2023400	2026400	What are they doing thinking about science?
2026400	2029400	They're like, well, God said I can own people.
2029400	2034400	However, we might be able to breathe underwater.
2034400	2035400	Well, wait a minute.
2035400	2037400	Pick a lane.
2037400	2040400	All we're saying to you is one day we'll live in a fucking hive mind.
2040400	2042400	Yeah, but we're going to fight that a little bit.
2042400	2044400	Think about how much you have to love slavery
2044400	2047400	to think that you can breathe underwater.
2047400	2049400	Two, it's like being a flat-earther,
2049400	2051400	so dedicated to your class that you fucking...
2051400	2052400	What are we doing here, people?
2052400	2054400	It's a space program that works,
2054400	2056400	because you want to take pictures of the flat earth,
2056400	2062400	and you're like, say cheese, you round piece of shit.
2062400	2064400	I know you're flat, and you're like,
2064400	2066400	holy shit, you made your own spaceship.
2066400	2069400	Yeah, fuck you, I'm not a dummy.
2069400	2072400	It's just an accent.
2073400	2075400	There's a lot of smart southern people.
2075400	2077400	Fucking oodles of them.
2077400	2079400	It's just a way you talk.
2079400	2082400	John Oliver's got a real low-class British accent.
2082400	2083400	What was the first...
2083400	2085400	I know that's why I can't think right now.
2085400	2087400	What was the first submersible in Civil War?
2087400	2090400	There was like bathyspheres probably first, right?
2090400	2092400	Which is just on a big crane,
2092400	2096400	and so it's not a self-contained, it doesn't cruise around,
2096400	2097400	but you lower it.
2097400	2099400	There were submersibles that would use to go underwater,
2099400	2104400	go up to a sailing vessel and attach bombs to it.
2104400	2106400	Well, the Civil War thing, I think,
2106400	2110400	it was basically a higher tech equivalent
2110400	2114400	of six dudes putting a bathtub over their heads
2114400	2118400	and carrying a spear with a bomb on the end of it,
2118400	2121400	so they could walk up to ships.
2121400	2123400	That's hyperbole.
2123400	2125400	Is anybody in the audience relatively happy?
2125400	2127400	Is anybody here in the Civil War?
2128400	2131400	Do we have any Confederates in the house tonight?
2131400	2133400	They kind of blew themselves up,
2133400	2136400	but they also did accomplish a lot.
2136400	2138400	It's a very twisted, strange story
2138400	2140400	because there was also a bit of forensics to it.
2140400	2143400	No one knows what happened down there.
2143400	2146400	What happened is they succeeded in their mission
2146400	2148400	and then exploded, I think is what it was,
2148400	2150400	and no one knows what went wrong.
2150400	2154400	Was there a lot of naval battles during the Civil War?
2154400	2155400	Yeah.
2156400	2157400	What was it?
2157400	2158400	Yeah, there was.
2158400	2160400	There was the Iron Clads
2160400	2162400	and there were also submersibles that would go in
2162400	2163400	and try to torpedo the...
2163400	2165400	But it was more about...
2165400	2167400	It's like blockades and things
2167400	2169400	because you're talking about supply lines chiefly.
2169400	2172400	You're not competing for domination over the seas,
2172400	2173400	except in the...
2173400	2175400	But then again, that's a description of all war.
2175400	2177400	It's just that, no, there aren't a lot of famous
2177400	2181400	like Waterloos happening on the water.
2181400	2182400	Why did it...
2182400	2184400	I always pictured Waterloo.
2184400	2186400	For the elbow.
2186400	2188400	Hey, I'd rather, you know,
2188400	2191400	enough about the conquering the seas.
2191400	2194400	I want to hear about conquering the bees.
2194400	2195400	Hello!
2195400	2196400	Let's go back.
2196400	2198400	Can we have that intro music again?
2198400	2200400	This is all part of that segment.
2200400	2201400	Yeah.
2201400	2202400	Hit it.
2202400	2204400	Hit it.
2204400	2207400	Six legs.
2207400	2208400	Four wings.
2208400	2209400	Four wings.
2209400	2210400	Four wings.
2210400	2211400	Four wings.
2211400	2213400	Pollen sacks on the knees.
2213400	2215400	Terry in that cargo.
2215400	2216400	You're the bees knees.
2216400	2217400	You're the bees knees.
2217400	2218400	You're the bees knees.
2218400	2219400	You're the bees knees.
2219400	2222400	Motherfucker, please listen to my fleas.
2222400	2223400	They don't know nothing.
2223400	2225400	I'm the flea, I ain't a bee.
2225400	2227400	But Pollen makes me sneeze.
2227400	2228400	Yo.
2229400	2232400	Kingdom Animalia.
2236400	2238400	Phylum Insectoid.
2238400	2239400	Insectae.
2239400	2240400	Insectae.
2242400	2243400	Order.
2243400	2244400	What comes after Phylum?
2244400	2246400	King Philip Eats Pussy.
2246400	2247400	What's the...
2247400	2248400	Eats?
2248400	2249400	I think Order, right?
2249400	2250400	King Philip Order.
2250400	2251400	Order.
2251400	2252400	Class.
2252400	2253400	Order.
2253400	2254400	Class.
2254400	2256400	Is the order Hymenoptera?
2256400	2257400	Hymenoptera.
2257400	2258400	He's an ants.
2258400	2259400	Okay.
2259400	2261400	Taxonomy wrap.
2261400	2264400	A Hymenologist or...
2264400	2267400	Hell yeah.
2267400	2270400	I'm a Hymenologist.
2270400	2272400	You know what I'm saying?
2272400	2274400	That's what I'm talking about.
2274400	2276400	Spencer is a fucking hymenologist.
2276400	2278400	Spencer is a fucking hymenologist.
2278400	2280400	I'll remove that shit before you...
2280400	2281400	Okay, Spencer.
2281400	2286400	Spencer, what's the new deal with bees in the background?
2286400	2287400	In the backyard.
2287400	2288400	We're getting rid of them.
2288400	2289400	Just quickly.
2289400	2290400	I looked it up.
2290400	2291400	H.L. Huntley was a seven person.
2291400	2292400	Don't get rid of the bees.
2292400	2293400	We need bees, right?
2293400	2294400	Submarine.
2294400	2295400	No, we don't need bees.
2295400	2297400	That's a common misconception.
2297400	2299400	Or what do you call it?
2299400	2303400	Colony Collapse Disorder is a natural thing that should be allowed to continue.
2303400	2305400	Until all bees are gone.
2307400	2311400	And I won't hear anything else on the subject.
2311400	2315400	No, but it was a seven man submarine that, yeah, they had a bomb spear.
2315400	2319400	They sank a ship and then they got lost before they returned.
2319400	2321400	And then they basically recommissioned it.
2321400	2322400	The monitor.
2322400	2323400	That's what I'm thinking of.
2323400	2326400	Was it an ironclad or was it a submersible?
2326400	2327400	I don't know.
2327400	2329400	The H.L. Huntley was the Confederate submarine.
2329400	2331400	Then they did it again and the same thing happened.
2331400	2334400	They sank a ship and the crew all died.
2334400	2335400	Great times.
2335400	2336400	Anyway, bees, huh?
2336400	2339400	Well, the story isn't a good story.
2339400	2342400	I called up this bee man, the good bee man.
2342400	2343400	Okay.
2343400	2347400	So last time we talked about the bees, there is this this comical bee man who
2347400	2351400	came and he was hammering on a wall and he wasn't getting too far.
2351400	2352400	It was great.
2352400	2353400	Oh, boy.
2353400	2354400	I had a great time.
2354400	2355400	He was collecting leaves.
2355400	2356400	Where are these bees?
2356400	2357400	They live in a tree.
2357400	2358400	What's going on?
2358400	2359400	Oh, they live in a wall, Jeff.
2359400	2360400	Okay.
2360400	2364400	There's a retaining wall that holds back some dirt and behind that wall are just
2364400	2366400	a bunch of bees because there's like a hole.
2366400	2370400	The wall is adjacent to another wall and that wall, not the retaining wall,
2370400	2371400	has a hole in it.
2371400	2372400	And so the bees crawl in that hole.
2372400	2373400	Are these dangerous bees?
2373400	2374400	Are these the ones?
2374400	2375400	Oh, they're the worst.
2375400	2376400	Yeah.
2376400	2377400	They sting you.
2377400	2378400	Holy shit.
2378400	2379400	Have you ever been stung by a bee?
2379400	2380400	I've only...
2380400	2381400	No, never.
2381400	2382400	Never?
2382400	2384400	I've stepped on a bee and I got stung by stepping on a bee.
2384400	2387400	That counts as being stung by a bee.
2387400	2391400	That was me stinging a bee by killing it.
2391400	2393400	I've never had a bee come over and fuck it.
2393400	2397400	Maybe the bee got stung by your foot.
2397400	2399400	Oh, shit.
2400400	2401400	He was the true bee all along.
2401400	2404400	But there's like a colony of honey bees living in my wall.
2404400	2407400	Yeah, honey bees.
2407400	2409400	Bees never did me any dirt.
2409400	2411400	Bees are always just fucking minding their biz.
2411400	2412400	But one time...
2412400	2414400	You haven't had a colony in your house.
2414400	2415400	Minding their biz.
2415400	2416400	Bees.
2416400	2417400	I mean, come on.
2417400	2418400	Mind your own beeswax.
2418400	2420400	You don't deserve me.
2420400	2421400	I don't...
2421400	2422400	You don't know me back.
2422400	2423400	No one deserves...
2423400	2424400	Minding their biz.
2424400	2425400	That's not great.
2425400	2426400	It's great.
2426400	2427400	I don't want to...
2427400	2428400	No, this is shit on your jokes.
2428400	2429400	This is the kind of shit...
2429400	2431400	I think the time's run out.
2431400	2432400	Yes.
2432400	2433400	I don't know.
2433400	2435400	I mean, I don't want to shit on your jokes.
2435400	2436400	How about time?
2436400	2438400	I will if I have to.
2438400	2439400	Minding their biz.
2439400	2440400	Okay, so there's a bee.
2440400	2441400	No, I get it.
2441400	2442400	We all get it.
2442400	2443400	I'm a fucking genius.
2443400	2444400	Well, no one can argue that.
2444400	2445400	You see how easy this is?
2445400	2448400	Comptroller, now I'm just loose as a fucking Christmas goose right now.
2448400	2449400	I know.
2449400	2450400	Now you know what I have to go through.
2450400	2451400	Now you're fucking...
2451400	2452400	Yeah, you're just torture.
2452400	2453400	You know what?
2453400	2454400	This is...
2454400	2457400	The podium here, the little lectern is a fucking curse.
2457400	2458880	Because it inhibits you.
2458880	2462800	They call it old coffin bones.
2462800	2466320	That's what the very small community of comptroller's call it.
2466320	2468600	I know you're jargon down in the galley.
2468600	2470400	I didn't know that you were so hip to her.
2470400	2476080	I know your comptroller slang that you try to use to say stuff.
2476080	2477080	It's old coffin.
2477080	2480080	Oh, time to go stand in front of old coffin bones.
2480080	2482400	I know that means the lectern.
2482400	2484400	Yeah.
2484400	2486400	Lectern, Clyde.
2486400	2487400	Goddamn.
2487400	2492680	All right, so Spencer, there's a colony of honey bees living in my back wall.
2492680	2494080	How do you know they're honey bees?
2494080	2495080	Well, they have...
2495080	2496080	They have honey bees.
2496080	2497080	You like that?
2497080	2501840	Every which way but loose reference, I just like drop on you.
2501840	2504240	Thank you, Clyde.
2504240	2505240	Thank you.
2505240	2506240	This guy knows.
2506240	2507240	Two people in the audience.
2507240	2508240	Hey.
2508240	2509240	Yeah.
2509240	2510240	Somebody else is over 45.
2510240	2513520	Well, I mean, how many kinds of bees are there?
2513520	2515480	Like most of them are honey bees, right?
2515480	2518200	Otherwise they're like wasps or some shit.
2518200	2519200	There's bumblebees.
2519200	2520200	Now you're being...
2520200	2521200	Yellow jackets.
2521200	2522200	Those are...
2522200	2523200	Yeah.
2523200	2524200	There's those guys.
2524200	2525200	Those are called...
2525200	2526200	Or actually wasps.
2526200	2527200	We called those bees in Milwaukee.
2527200	2528360	We were just like, oh, it's a bee, but those were wasps.
2528360	2529360	The yellow jackets, right?
2529360	2530360	What are the yellow jackets?
2530360	2531360	Well, there's yellow jackets.
2531360	2536360	For what I understand, there's all great people guessing about bugs.
2536360	2540960	To me, the wasps are those giant ones that have the super long limbs and the super kind
2540960	2541960	of extended stickers.
2541960	2542960	Hornets?
2542960	2543960	Yeah, those hornets?
2543960	2544960	I would call those wasps, but I don't know.
2545440	2546440	We got a real...
2546440	2550920	I would say yellow jackets are hornets basically, but I mean, I don't know.
2550920	2553540	There's not one entomologist in the audience.
2553540	2554540	Not even like a...
2554540	2556360	We've got a confederate scholar.
2556360	2557360	We've got no confederates.
2557360	2558360	No confederates.
2558360	2561440	What do you people do?
2561440	2563920	You're not very specialized.
2563920	2566080	You don't know about bugs and you don't support slavery?
2566080	2567080	What the fuck?
2567080	2570160	We're going to find out what you're good at tonight.
2570160	2571160	That kills you.
2571160	2574920	What do you think is the common denominator of the...
2575880	2579480	I think they're all morticians.
2579480	2580480	I don't know.
2580480	2581480	I don't know.
2581480	2582480	They seem like nice people.
2582480	2583480	I don't know what...
2583480	2584480	I mean, that's...
2584480	2588680	Who plays recreational highlight?
2588680	2589680	Two people.
2589680	2590680	Two people.
2590680	2591680	Two people.
2591680	2592680	Only two people.
2592680	2593680	All right.
2593680	2594680	We're getting there.
2594680	2596680	We're tracking down a trail of clues over here.
2596680	2598240	It's like, guess who?
2598240	2599240	All right.
2599240	2600240	I know.
2600240	2601240	It's David.
2601240	2603400	So there's a bunch of honeybees living in the back wall.
2603400	2604400	Yeah.
2604640	2607440	He was like, oh, you didn't tell me there was a wall.
2607440	2610600	I was like, I definitely told you there was a wall.
2610600	2611600	That happened again?
2611600	2612600	No, no.
2612600	2613600	This time around.
2613600	2617320	So before that guy came, we had the guy from this company came.
2617320	2622000	He looked like he was 16 and like, I know I must be getting old because I'm like, you're
2622000	2623000	an adult.
2623000	2624000	You can have a job or something.
2624000	2625000	He's like, fuck you.
2625000	2627520	And you're like, you can be offended by being called young.
2627520	2628520	Yeah.
2628520	2629520	When you're young.
2629520	2630520	Yeah.
2630520	2631520	All right.
2631520	2632520	You have to be really good.
2632640	2636400	Is there a bee problem that these bees are concerned like you're worried about?
2636400	2637400	Yeah.
2637400	2641280	What's the, what's the, what's the fucking, what's the 4-1-1 on these?
2641280	2642840	You guys have the yards.
2642840	2643840	Come on.
2643840	2648560	All I know is that these electronic doofuses are trying to like run wire somewhere so they
2648560	2655280	can make my doorbell connect to just a gun that shoots me in the face.
2655280	2656320	And they're there.
2656320	2657440	I don't have that.
2657440	2660880	I can't look them in the eyes to tell them they're working on a house that no one lives
2660880	2662160	in anymore.
2662160	2668480	And because I feel like I feel like they, this is their purgatory.
2668480	2671320	They deserve to work on this house until they die.
2671320	2675960	And so I don't talk to them, but I guess there's string and wire back there and they needed
2675960	2676960	to go through a wall.
2676960	2678440	And one of the walls had bees in it.
2678440	2684600	So they immediately quit, ran away and said, enjoy your doorbell.
2684600	2688840	And like, they're waiting for us to deal with bees so they can run the wire.
2688840	2691400	This is a new house or the old house.
2691400	2694720	I'm not never doing anything like this again at any house I ever live in.
2694720	2696520	You're just going to get 12 boomboxes.
2696520	2697520	Yeah.
2697520	2698520	You don't have to.
2698520	2700440	These guys are afraid of bees.
2700440	2702640	Why do you got to wire the wall?
2702640	2704200	I don't have to.
2704200	2706280	I don't even want to be there anymore.
2706280	2707280	Be there.
2707280	2711120	He doesn't want to be there.
2711120	2713400	Thank you.
2713400	2716080	He just wanted to mind your own business.
2716080	2719560	Hey, is this, is this bit work?
2719560	2720560	Okay.
2720560	2721560	Let me ask.
2721560	2722560	Let me ask.
2722560	2723560	Let me ask.
2723560	2724560	Let me ask.
2724560	2729520	And tell me if I'm not the first person to do this because this is probably hack.
2729520	2731360	So okay.
2731360	2733680	It's not called show biz.
2733680	2735880	It's called show fuh.
2735880	2737880	Show fuh?
2737880	2741560	Hey, hey, hey buddy.
2741560	2743620	It's not called show biz.
2743620	2746040	It's called show, oh, I fucked it up.
2746040	2747040	No, yeah.
2747040	2748040	I fucked it up.
2748040	2750520	It's not called show fuh.
2750520	2756120	No, what does it think where you, how many workshop this for Comic Con?
2756120	2760640	It's not called show, it's called show biz, not show fun.
2760640	2764400	So show business, it's called show fun.
2764400	2766920	I fucked it up again.
2766920	2767920	Way too high.
2767920	2769040	Well, cause for you it is fun.
2769040	2771040	You got high too?
2771040	2772040	Yes.
2772040	2776960	Robbie, when does Comic Con, how many days from Comic Con?
2776960	2778200	It's next week, right?
2778200	2779200	Is it next week?
2779200	2780200	I think next Thursday.
2780880	2781880	You got to get your fucking act together.
2781880	2782880	Yeah, get a new outfit.
2782880	2783880	Someone said 12.
2783880	2787040	What are you going to wear as the panel?
2787040	2792120	Let's have the audience decide.
2792120	2794120	You have to dress as Ryan Ridley.
2794120	2800560	I dress as Ryan Ridley with my sunglasses on my head and sleeves rolled up and yeah,
2800560	2801560	right.
2801560	2804360	Wait, wait, walk me back through the show business joke.
2804360	2805360	Okay.
2805360	2809760	You know, it's like, it's, it's, it's called show business, not show fun.
2809760	2811200	It's not called show biz.
2811200	2812200	It's called show fun.
2812200	2815200	That's not even, that's not even how I understand that.
2815200	2816440	Yeah, I've never heard show fun.
2816440	2818520	I hear people go like, it's not called show friends.
2818520	2819520	It's called show business.
2819520	2820520	Right.
2820520	2823120	They don't abbreviate it and they don't say fun.
2823120	2824680	I hear fun all the time.
2824680	2825680	I sign folks.
2825680	2827640	Because, because it's a constant problem in Hollywood.
2827640	2830880	People having too much fun and it getting in the way of business.
2830880	2833240	No, it's people having friendships.
2833240	2834720	That's the thing that gets in the way.
2834720	2835720	Okay.
2835720	2836720	All right.
2836720	2838320	It's an agent that made up this thing.
2838320	2839320	All right.
2839320	2841080	It was like, Hey, it's not called show friends.
2841080	2843160	So you're saying don't open with this.
2843160	2844160	No.
2844160	2846560	Well, cause yours goes backwards and no one knows.
2846560	2851360	Hey, it's not called show business, which it is.
2851360	2852360	I screwed it up.
2852360	2853360	It's called show far.
2853360	2854360	Yeah.
2854360	2855360	I screwed it up.
2855360	2860080	It's like a Steve Martin thing, but it's not, you need to, you need to take the same Steve
2860080	2864480	Martin absurdism and put it on a different area entirely.
2864480	2870080	Where you go like, you know, two, two, two lefts don't make a, or two, two wrongs don't
2870080	2871400	make a right.
2871400	2872840	They make a wrong wrong.
2872840	2874160	You know, like that's the formula.
2874160	2875560	Do it over there.
2875560	2876560	Safer.
2876560	2877560	Interesting.
2877560	2883040	Wouldn't, wouldn't, if you were, if we're going to do the bee thing, uh, yeah, I don't
2883040	2892160	think we are apparently in the backyard of Dan's house, uh, they don't call it always
2892160	2894840	going to show business.
2894840	2898280	They call it show bees knees.
2898280	2899280	Show bees.
2899280	2900280	Okay.
2900280	2901280	We're just spit filing.
2901280	2902280	We're workshopping.
2902280	2903280	Oh, we're going to get this right.
2903280	2904280	That's not the final draft.
2904280	2905280	Show bees knees.
2905280	2906280	Dr. Beeville.
2906280	2907280	Dr. Beeville.
2907280	2908280	Beeville.
2908280	2909280	Yeah.
2909280	2910280	Dr. Beeville.
2910280	2911280	Right.
2911280	2912280	Okay.
2912280	2913280	Right.
2913280	2914280	A million dollars.
2914280	2915280	Oh right.
2915280	2916280	The Austin powers.
2916280	2917280	A million dollars.
2917280	2918280	Are you doing Carl Sagan?
2918280	2919280	$100.
2919280	2920280	A million dollars.
2920280	2921280	$1000.
2921280	2922280	Oh, that's the amount.
2922280	2923280	$100.
2923280	2924280	$100.
2924280	2925280	$1,500.
2925280	2926280	$1,500.
2926280	2927280	$1,500.
2927280	2928280	$2,500.
2928280	2929280	$1,500.
2929280	2930280	$100.
2930280	2931280	$1,500.
2931280	2932280	$1,500.
2932280	2933280	$1,500.
2933280	2934280	$1,500.
2934280	2935280	$1,500.
2935280	2950680	$1,000, oh that's the amount, $100, $10, $1,000,000, so it's all based on what you put the pinky
2950680	2951680	on your face.
2951680	2953720	Well yeah, what is it based on your face?
2953720	2957000	How did your face?
2957000	2961400	Where would you put 75 cents, like what's the pinky equivalent, like 75 cents?
2961400	2975360	So if this is 10, 75 cents, for me a freaking bird.
2975360	2979640	Is it still possible to find Jaws 4 on YouTube?
2979640	2981640	Not on YouTube, in my apartment.
2981640	2987280	God damn it, who by a plus knows what Jaws 4 is?
2987280	2990600	Who by a plus knows what piece of anatomy is heavily featured?
2990600	2992960	Well, it's the same people, probably.
2992960	2993960	About half.
2993960	3000840	I think it was the best thing that's ever happened.
3000840	3008240	We were having lunch at home restaurant on Hillhurst and it was Dan, Rob, Tom and I,
3008240	3009240	right?
3009240	3010240	Maybe Rob and Ross?
3010240	3011240	Yeah.
3011240	3014280	And we all said let's make, no one had ever seen Jaws 4.
3014280	3019560	We knew that, I think that we knew that Mario Van Peebles was in it, Michael Caine was in
3019560	3020560	it.
3020560	3021800	And that's all we knew.
3021800	3029040	And then we all said, meet back at Rob's place at 3 o'clock and everybody make Jaws 4 and
3029040	3033400	whoever gets closest wins to what we think happened.
3033400	3034400	And we-
3034400	3035400	Because we're going to watch it.
3035400	3036400	We're going to watch it all.
3036400	3040360	And we got to Rob's place and I remember knocking on the door, it was the apartment I used to
3040360	3041360	live in.
3041360	3046080	And I'm knocking on the door and I hear Rob laughing and he's so high, you can just feel
3046080	3047080	the weed going on.
3047080	3052160	And he goes, give me five minutes.
3052160	3059200	And his Jaws 4, Dan came closest, Dan actually came closest to the actual story.
3059200	3063360	Dan did an animated really impressive thing, it was super funny.
3063360	3068200	And you kind of got close to what the actual story structure was.
3068200	3075520	Rob put a piece of duct tape on his penis and made a shark fin with the numeral four
3075520	3076520	on it.
3076520	3085360	And he put like a little eyeball on the head of his dick to make a shark called Jaws 4.
3085360	3088080	And he fucked a lemon, or was it orange or a lemon?
3088080	3089080	It was like an orange.
3089080	3091400	It was an orange, but it was, you know-
3091400	3096440	It came off lemony in the, because you did a color pass on it, right?
3096440	3097440	No.
3098160	3099160	It was all in camera.
3099160	3103880	Yeah, so it was like he had two oranges on pencils and one was Michael Caine and one
3103880	3106080	was Catherine Deneuve for no reason.
3106080	3108080	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3108080	3109080	And-
3109080	3112080	So fucking stoned doing it.
3112080	3116880	So we're all sitting around watching this thing and then at one point Jaws 4 comes in
3116880	3117880	and it's Rob's-
3117880	3123400	Well, first you get to meet Michael Caine who for no reason talks like this, I'm Michael
3123400	3124400	Caine.
3125400	3129880	I gotta find that shark there.
3129880	3132000	I'm Catherine Deneuve.
3132000	3137080	And I hope, and it's like a orange with a feminine like kissy face on it.
3137080	3139520	And then the Michael Caine one is just like square glass.
3139520	3140520	Yeah, he's got the-
3140520	3142960	I'm Michael Caine.
3142960	3146840	The IPCRIS files or the Get Carter, like the fucking big square glass.
3146840	3152800	So they're on a boat against like this construction paper ocean that's like Wes Anderson-y, like
3152800	3153800	before-
3154680	3157040	You didn't go back and edit it because you were just shooting it like-
3157040	3158040	It was all in camera.
3158040	3159040	In camera edits.
3159040	3160040	Yeah.
3160040	3161040	And I could hear you laughing.
3161040	3162520	It's like, I've almost got it.
3162520	3163520	I've almost got it.
3163520	3167520	And it's like, shut up, I'm gonna get that shark.
3167520	3170760	Oh, I hope there's no sharks up there.
3170760	3174320	Oh, I'm Catherine Deneuve.
3174320	3180760	And then the shark comes in and it's his dick and he's got a duct tape thing on it.
3180760	3184840	And then the shark, I'm going, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, and his pants are around
3184840	3190240	his thighs and his shirt's like kind of pulled up like a fucking gross porn star with like
3190240	3194880	pull up his shirt the bare minimum and he's like going through his own construction paper
3194880	3195880	ocean.
3195880	3204960	It's like the duality of Man Child like, look, I made a whole ocean so I can fucking- my dick
3204960	3205960	is a shark.
3205960	3208200	I was trying to get a hard on to-
3208200	3209200	Yeah, but you can't-
3209400	3211320	You halfway succeeded.
3211320	3215720	You can't fluff because you have an impressive penis and I think it's Sarah Silverman herself
3215720	3217920	so like you should be very proud of your penis.
3217920	3218920	But you can't-
3218920	3219920	Half two messes.
3219920	3220920	You can't keep a-
3220920	3227360	I'm kind of glad I didn't because it would have been really like, ugh, why are you still
3227360	3228920	hard doing this?
3228920	3229920	I don't think it's funny.
3229920	3234240	Because you can't fluff yourself while you have like your-
3234240	3235360	And it was under pressure.
3235360	3236880	You guys were outside in the hall.
3236960	3240160	But you have a little eyeball like tape-
3240160	3241560	I was losing the light.
3241560	3243560	Yeah, you're losing your light.
3243560	3244560	It was last looks.
3244560	3245560	Yeah.
3245560	3246560	I just-
3246560	3247560	You can't-
3247560	3248560	You only won.
3248560	3252200	You can't fluff it when you're gonna ruin the costume if you try to fucking fluff it.
3252200	3253200	Yeah.
3253200	3257520	And so you're- I would give it- like I would say you were kind of like 40% there.
3257520	3258520	Yeah.
3258520	3259520	Right.
3259520	3262600	But then the final- is it a spoiler if I tell you what happens at the end?
3262600	3264760	Yeah, it's a spoiler.
3264760	3265760	No, no.
3265760	3276080	So at the end, you hear Michael Kang of- and it's Rob stuffing his now mostly flaccid shark
3276080	3282120	jaws for a penis into a hole he had cut into the orange.
3282120	3288120	And it's him fucking Michael Kang in the mouth.
3288360	3297360	And then the shark withdraws from the artificially gouged stunt mouth.
3297360	3298360	Right.
3298360	3302800	He had a standby orange with a stunt mouth carved in it that would be the size of-
3302800	3306360	It wasn't the hero orange, it was the stunky orange.
3306360	3315760	And so Rob's flaccid penis withdraws from that hole, which memorably in 720p resolution,
3315760	3323800	the TV cameras at the time, a slight string of either citrus or what have you, like briefly
3323800	3328920	connects the subject from the object as it withdraws.
3328920	3334440	And it's got cartoon eyes glued on it for its final shot of the segment, as voiced by
3334440	3342440	Shrobs looks at Catherine Deneuve and says, mind your own business, woman.
3342440	3345320	Finn.
3345320	3348040	It's the greatest work you've ever done.
3348040	3354280	And it's Sarah Silverman said, I want that guy to direct my pilot.
3354280	3355280	That was it.
3355280	3356280	That was it?
3356280	3357280	The Sarah Silverman program.
3357280	3360640	She chose Rob to direct the Sarah Silverman program off of Jaws 4.
3360640	3361640	Face that.
3361640	3362640	Yeah.
3362640	3368040	And that's what started my career as a director.
3368040	3370520	I forgot that awesome coda.
3370520	3371520	Yeah.
3371520	3374120	She put it in her book.
3374120	3376080	She put it in her book.
3376080	3378880	She put it in her book.
3378880	3379880	Yeah.
3379880	3380880	Nobody was on the internet yet.
3380880	3388160	It was, we didn't, we thought it was a hole where you like threw stuff that was like bad.
3388160	3391840	That video was ever got in Sarah Silverman's book.
3391840	3395720	That video was on the internet while you were working on Lego too.
3395720	3397120	Yeah.
3397120	3399320	Which is just crazy to think about.
3399320	3402560	It was also, and Comedy Central did this.
3402560	3405240	They put it on their front page.
3405240	3406240	Jaws 4?
3406240	3407240	Yeah.
3407240	3408240	What?
3408240	3409240	Yeah.
3409240	3410240	I think somebody went, oh, haha.
3410240	3414800	Cause it was on 101 for some reason for a really long time.
3414800	3418720	And then they, and then the Comedy Central probably didn't watch it.
3418720	3423240	They go, oh, this is a sample of what, uh, you know, Sarah looked at to get it and put
3423240	3424240	it up there.
3424240	3426880	And then there's this comments going, holy shit.
3426880	3427880	Not safe for work.
3427880	3428880	There's a dick in this.
3428880	3432560	What are you going to, what are your fucking name?
3432560	3436320	The dick is the fucking title character.
3436320	3443480	Also, I love that Jaws, people call the shark Jaws or people call Bruce Willis Die Hard.
3443480	3446320	Even though that wasn't his name, his name was John McClain.
3446320	3451880	Well, the whole thing starts with Jaws waking up in the morning and there's a roaster crewing.
3451880	3457080	And that's when you first see Rob's dick is the shark and it goes over to a half eaten
3457080	3458080	bowl.
3458080	3462680	A bowl of cereal with only milk and a couple of fruit loops in it.
3462680	3466400	And Rob's dick goes, what the hell?
3466400	3471640	Michael Caine ate all my cereal with it.
3471640	3479360	I'm going to get my revenge on him because the movie was called Jaws for the revenge.
3479360	3483520	So wait, who's, who's the protagonist is it just for, is it Michael Caine or Catherine
3483520	3484520	today?
3484960	3488000	Michael Caine's the one who changes the most.
3488000	3490480	That question's viability is the sign of art.
3490480	3492240	He certainly does.
3492240	3497240	He changes from not having a dick in his mouth to having a dick in his mouth.
3497240	3499240	Yes, that's true.
3499240	3504040	Michael Caine has slightly more of an art, yes.
3504040	3508120	Michael Caine ate all my cereal.
3508120	3510120	Shut up, woman.
3511120	3516080	And there's a line of dialogue that I won't repeat because there's one thing that is problematic
3516080	3517080	in this era.
3517080	3520560	But like I was talking to Steve Agee, like Steve Agee did a channel one on one thing
3520560	3524760	which I won't even say what it is because he wants that to go away.
3524760	3529720	We can't talk about it, but it's something that he cannot get off of IMDB of something
3529720	3534680	that he's done that was channel one on one when everything was just fun.
3534680	3540560	And now it's like, it's the kind of shit that can ruin you and he cannot expunge that
3540560	3541560	from history.
3541560	3542560	Yeah.
3547560	3550160	I mean, but like you, what was the one where you fucked a baby in the cat?
3550160	3551160	Oh, what was that?
3551160	3552160	Let's not go there.
3552160	3554160	What was that again?
3554160	3556160	Watering power.
3556160	3558160	Watering power.
3558160	3563160	Yeah, I definitely fucked a baby in the channel one on one video.
3565000	3567000	And then they were like, hey, look at this.
3567000	3572760	And I was like, why are you making everyone look at that?
3572760	3574760	Because you should be fired.
3574760	3581600	I'm like, well, yeah, if that's what I'm doing now, like, yeah, I shouldn't work.
3581600	3584440	Like, why are you doing that?
3584440	3586120	Yeah, check it out.
3586120	3588960	I didn't say Siri anything.
3588960	3590960	Turn your wallet off.
3590960	3593480	Anyways, yeah.
3593480	3594480	Recording.
3595280	3600280	Yeah, somebody was actually trying to record that, get you busted again.
3600280	3601280	Microphone.
3601280	3602280	Is team Z here?
3602280	3603280	Roseanne Revenge.
3603280	3605280	My God, Roseanne got fired.
3605280	3607280	Dan got Roseanne fired.
3607280	3609280	They had to take action.
3609280	3610280	How come you fired Roseanne?
3610280	3612280	You don't fire this guy.
3612280	3614280	You guys love Roseanne.
3614280	3616280	Give me a break.
3616280	3619280	That's a fucking liar in this room.
3619280	3623280	Anyways, I know I'm I'm actually I was thinking it was floating in my pool today.
3623280	3635280	How grateful I am that right right before I became like, too ridiculously privileged to like be charismatic that the that I got like that send off.
3635280	3637280	It was like, no one's ever gonna like you.
3637280	3639280	You fucking dork.
3639280	3641280	And I was like, oh, good.
3641280	3646280	Because I was just getting to that point where I would have to either give to charity or feel like a monster.
3646280	3650280	And I'm just floating in my pool going, I don't have to do anything.
3650280	3653280	Everyone picked on me the whole time.
3653280	3655280	The net result.
3655280	3658280	I can I can leave that paper trail in my own head.
3658280	3659280	But do you give to charity?
3659280	3662280	No, you're not listening to me.
3662280	3666280	Like, I don't have to do anything ever.
3666280	3668280	People are mean.
3668280	3669280	They're mean if you're nice.
3669280	3670280	They're mean if you're honest.
3670280	3672280	They're mean if you're there.
3672280	3674280	People are gross and mean.
3674280	3676280	You don't have to love them or trust them.
3676280	3680280	You don't have to get up in the morning and set your watch by what they give a fuck about.
3680280	3682280	Like, they're not real.
3682280	3684280	They're bad people.
3684280	3697280	So if you accidentally trip over a rock and there's a million dollars under it, you can actually sleep like a baby that night if you don't spend it on cheeseburgers that fall from drones over the poorest neighborhood.
3697280	3705280	I think if you as the audience can take one thing away tonight, it's whatever the fuck Dan just said right now.
3706280	3710280	True words.
3710280	3714280	Rob, you should try pandering to Rick and Morty fans.
3714280	3717280	I mean, truly an example of pandering to Rick and Morty fans.
3717280	3724280	Well, you guys are more adorable than Mr. Poopy butthole.
3724280	3729280	Just literally just go like, oh, man, that's more helpful than Mr. Meeseeks.
3729280	3730280	Like, they'll fucking lose their fuck.
3730280	3732280	That's what Dan met with this switch.
3732280	3738280	Like, you just go, the gun that shoots portals and people will be like, ah.
3738280	3740280	Why did Rob get the job and not Spencer?
3740280	3742280	This guy fucking seems ready to roll.
3742280	3746280	Yeah, why would anyone not want me to do that?
3746280	3748280	You're on deck, man.
3748280	3751280	Look, I wasn't part of this meeting.
3751280	3753280	I was not being serious.
3753280	3754280	How did this come about?
3754280	3756280	Who chose who?
3756280	3761280	I thought Dan requested me and I said, sure.
3761280	3764280	No, no.
3764280	3766280	Who would you want?
3766280	3767280	I don't know.
3767280	3768280	I don't care.
3768280	3772280	It was pitched to me and I was like, that's fine.
3772280	3773280	Who did it?
3773280	3774280	Well, Rob.
3774280	3780280	I said, there's no such thing as a bad idea.
3780280	3784280	I thought you wanted me to be here with you.
3784280	3787280	Who did it before you, Rob?
3787280	3788280	Who did it last year?
3788280	3789280	Yeah, name the last moderator.
3789280	3790280	I don't know.
3790280	3791280	It's such an honor.
3791280	3792280	You do know, don't you?
3792280	3793280	You were researching.
3793280	3794280	I don't remember.
3794280	3796280	Not by name, but it was just some guy.
3796280	3797280	Jeffrey Epstein.
3797280	3798280	Oh, boy.
3798280	3801280	I don't recognize him.
3801280	3804280	He's on a really popular show that I don't know.
3804280	3805280	Did they do a bad job?
3805280	3807280	Is that why you're doing it this time?
3807280	3808280	I don't know.
3808280	3810280	Didn't you ask me and I said, yes.
3810280	3814280	I thought, you know, if my friend wants me there to be with him,
3814280	3817280	I'm going to try to do my best to support him.
3818280	3820280	Let's bring out Steve Levy.
3820280	3821280	Yeah.
3821280	3822280	Get to the bottom of this.
3822280	3823280	Steve Levy.
3823280	3824280	Music.
3824280	3825280	Music.
3826280	3827280	Music.
3827280	3828280	Music.
3842280	3843280	Listen, you're right.
3843280	3846280	Steve and Levi! Steve and Levi!
3846280	3851280	Steve and Levi! Steve and Levi!
3851280	3853280	Thank you for that intro.
3853280	3855280	You're going to crush at Comic Con.
3855280	3857280	I'm going to crush what?
3857280	3859280	You're going to crush at Comic Con.
3859280	3861280	God, what if I do?
3861280	3863280	This could be your big break.
3863280	3866280	This could be a real fucking game changer.
3866280	3868280	Was it your pitch?
3868280	3870280	Unfortunately, it wasn't my pitch.
3870280	3872280	The network came to me and said,
3872280	3875280	Hey, we've seen Rob Schwab moderate things before.
3875280	3876280	We really like that guy.
3876280	3877280	You think he'd be interested?
3877280	3880280	And I said, OK, well, let me check.
3880280	3882280	You got fans upstairs.
3882280	3884280	Well, that's good.
3884280	3886280	That's good.
3886280	3888280	So you're just tolerating my presence.
3888280	3891280	He always is.
3891280	3893280	So...
3893280	3898280	Dan and Justin both approved you doing the moderation.
3898280	3899280	Totally approved.
3899280	3900280	It was in a text message.
3900280	3903280	Justin did and Dan.
3903280	3906280	And the previous moderator was the impractical,
3906280	3908280	one of the impractical jokers.
3908280	3909280	Just some guy.
3909280	3910280	Brian Quinn.
3910280	3913280	What are you doing, Martin Quinn?
3913280	3916280	I want to be doing some singing to Martin Quinn.
3916280	3919280	What is that?
3919280	3921280	What is that song?
3921280	3922280	Martha Nixon?
3922280	3923280	Yeah.
3923280	3924280	Martha Quinn.
3924280	3925280	Do you know what I'm talking about?
3925280	3926280	Is it Eton Martha's Muffin?
3926280	3928280	No, Stefan Martha's Muffin.
3928280	3934280	I'm assuming you're talking about Stefan Martha's Muffin by Mojo Nixon.
3934280	3937280	I met Mojo Nixon once in Austin, Texas,
3937280	3939280	and he was everything you wanted.
3939280	3942280	What are you talking about?
3942280	3944280	Mojo Nixon.
3944280	3945280	Oh, Mojo Nixon.
3945280	3946280	If you don't got Mojo Nixon,
3946280	3948280	then your story could get some fixin'.
3948280	3949280	OK.
3949280	3950280	I never said it could.
3950280	3951280	I think the song Elvis is everywhere.
3951280	3952280	Is that a Mojo Nixon song?
3952280	3953280	Am I right?
3953280	3956280	Oh, he's a music guy.
3956280	3957280	Don't look at me.
3957280	3958280	I don't know.
3958280	3959280	He's practicing.
3959280	3961280	Who's saying punk rock girl?
3961280	3962280	That's Dead Milkman.
3962280	3963280	Dead Milkman, yes.
3963280	3964280	Oh, hell yeah.
3964280	3965280	In that one, we went to record store.
3965280	3966280	I like those guys.
3966280	3967280	We asked for Mojo Nixon.
3967280	3968280	They said he didn't work here.
3968280	3970280	They said if you've got Mojo Nixon,
3970280	3972280	then your story could get some fixin'.
3972280	3976280	I like that song, Stewart, by the way.
3976280	3978280	You know that kid, Stewart?
3978280	3980280	You know, it goes like that.
3980280	3983280	That was the precursor to Rick, from Rick and Morty, I think.
3983280	3984280	Is it right?
3984280	3986280	Yeah, he sounds just like him.
3986280	3988280	They're in it with the aliens.
3988280	3990280	This show is taking flight.
3990280	3991280	No, I know.
3991280	3994280	I think we're making fucking podcasts gold.
3994280	3997280	You can't create your own crisis and then be the hero.
3997280	4001280	Like if that guy with the mustache was like,
4001280	4004280	hey, Chernobyl's pretty poorly made.
4004280	4008280	You made the test go up to three Radcliffs whenever the...
4008280	4010280	Who's Radcliffs?
4010280	4012280	Who is your Radcliffs?
4012280	4013280	They measured it in Radcliffs?
4013280	4014280	How many Radcliffs?
4014280	4015280	How many Radcliffs?
4015280	4016280	How many Radcliffs?
4016280	4018280	I remember it was like 2.6 Radcliffs.
4018280	4020280	Oh, that was like a running joke.
4020280	4021280	And then we got to be like...
4021280	4022280	Rungson?
4022280	4023280	Rungman?
4023280	4024280	Rungman?
4024280	4025280	Rumpkins?
4025280	4026280	Rumpkins.
4026280	4027280	Rumpkins.
4027280	4028280	I think that was very interesting.
4028280	4032280	Isn't that kind of like a funny, like a bizarro DC thing
4032280	4034280	where it's like, oh yeah, what do we call it?
4034280	4037280	We call it like, it's just a name of some dude, right?
4037280	4040280	Like what is it like when the clicks that you get?
4040280	4041280	Geiger.
4041280	4042280	Geiger.
4042280	4044280	I'm sure there's like a Geiger who's probably a capitalist
4044280	4046280	and like they have their own Geiger
4046280	4049280	because nuclear energy is a modern thing.
4049280	4051280	It's post like this stance.
4051280	4055280	So they're not going to measure it in whatever the fuck we do.
4055280	4057280	Did people really wear the lead thong
4057280	4059280	where they put the fucking found lead
4059280	4060280	and make a little bikini out of it?
4060280	4061280	Yes, I hope so.
4061280	4062280	To protect their balls
4062280	4064280	like they thought that was going to work?
4064280	4065280	It didn't hurt.
4065280	4067280	To what extent is that like...
4067280	4071280	Yeah, I wonder if there's proper actual science
4071280	4073280	to that idea that you're most vulnerable
4073280	4075280	to radiation in your reproductive organs.
4075280	4077280	It makes sense scientifically.
4077280	4078280	Yeah, it certainly couldn't hurt.
4078280	4080280	I don't want to say it makes sense because I don't...
4080280	4083280	I think their whole body would deteriorate except their dick.
4083280	4084280	That's what they want.
4084280	4085280	Who is your favorite?
4085280	4088280	Who is your favorite gravelly voice character?
4088280	4092280	Obviously the guy that looked a little bit like Bill Murray,
4092280	4095280	the guy that was like...
4095280	4096280	Which one was that?
4096280	4098280	The guy, the one of the three.
4098280	4101280	I like the guy who shot dogs good.
4101280	4103280	And he's like, don't shoot the dogs badly
4103280	4105280	or I'll shoot you badly.
4105280	4110280	Did you wonder why they needed us to...
4110280	4111280	Shoot the dogs?
4111280	4113280	Well, to be part of all that, I guess it was just...
4113280	4115280	And I'm not dinging it.
4115280	4117280	I'm just like, did you think for any part of that
4117280	4119280	where you kind of like, I get it
4119280	4122280	because it's sort of like they want to give you
4122280	4127280	a full portrait of a crisis that happened
4127280	4132280	because people reserved political and literal power
4132280	4133280	for their control.
4133280	4135280	And then when that melts down,
4135280	4137280	if those people aren't responsible,
4137280	4141280	it trickles down to a fucking dog.
4141280	4143280	I didn't watch the series.
4143280	4145280	All right.
4145280	4147280	When it melts down,
4147280	4150280	can I listen to my roommate watch it?
4150280	4152280	I heard so many dogs getting shot.
4152280	4153280	It was really well done.
4153280	4154280	I'm going out on a limb here
4154280	4156280	by recommending you watch Chernobyl.
4156280	4158280	It's very good. It's very well done.
4158280	4163280	Yeah, I watched it because all of you were watching it.
4163280	4165280	I'm telling you my Chernobyl is good.
4165280	4167280	I liked it quite a bit.
4167280	4170280	Did you like the part where they shot all the dogs?
4170280	4172280	No, I fast forward over it.
4172280	4173280	That makes sense.
4173280	4174280	Really?
4174280	4175280	Yeah.
4175280	4176280	This guy can't watch that.
4176280	4178280	I know, I can watch people fucking dying horribly,
4178280	4179280	but if they...
4179280	4181280	Yeah, well, they're asking for it.
4182280	4185280	Okay, so, Levi?
4185280	4186280	Yeah.
4186280	4192280	Are you still a good guy?
4192280	4193280	I would hope so.
4193280	4194280	Okay.
4194280	4196280	We went to Waldron's bachelor party.
4196280	4197280	You want to give us some...
4197280	4199280	Oh yeah, you went to the Bahamas, right?
4199280	4200280	Give me some scandal.
4200280	4202280	Yeah, we went to the Bahamas.
4202280	4203280	I don't know how...
4203280	4204280	The Bahamas?
4204280	4206280	Yeah, we went to the Atlantis.
4206280	4207280	We were in Atlantis.
4207280	4208280	What?
4208280	4209280	The big-ass water party?
4209280	4212280	Yeah, yeah, the one where you see all the commercials
4212280	4214280	and you go down the slides through the shark tanks.
4214280	4216280	Who chose that? He?
4216280	4217280	Yeah.
4217280	4218280	All right.
4218280	4219280	Yeah.
4219280	4221280	There was 20 guys there to celebrate Waldron's future.
4221280	4223280	And you went to a water park.
4223280	4224280	Did you fuck a fish?
4224280	4225280	No, it's all a fancy hotel.
4225280	4226280	What?
4226280	4227280	But it's got the big water slide thing
4227280	4228280	and you go through a pyramid and whatnot.
4228280	4229280	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4229280	4230280	Yeah.
4230280	4232280	The water park just seems like a great way
4232280	4234280	to get all the hepatitis.
4234280	4235280	There was a lazy river.
4235280	4236280	Those are so fun.
4236280	4237280	Holy shit.
4237280	4238280	It was actually pretty fun.
4238280	4239280	It's like swimming without trying.
4239280	4240280	They don't put any effort.
4240280	4242280	Yeah, and they had like little rapids,
4242280	4243280	so it felt like, you know...
4243280	4244280	Man, that sounds fun.
4244280	4245280	Were the children there?
4245280	4246280	Was it all...
4246280	4248280	Is it rapid or is it lazy?
4248280	4250280	I mean, make up your mind, river.
4250280	4251280	Come on.
4251280	4252280	Pick a lane, Atlantis.
4252280	4255280	Yeah, little rapids, but you're lazy?
4255280	4258280	I mean, come on.
4258280	4263280	We were at the adults' hotel and then there were the kids.
4263280	4264280	Oh.
4264280	4265280	Yeah.
4265280	4266280	The adults' hotel.
4266280	4267280	Yeah, where the lotion goes on.
4267280	4268280	Yeah.
4268280	4274280	Never had a real jealousy of the people on the lazy river
4274280	4276280	at the hotels that boast those.
4276280	4277280	Yeah.
4277280	4278280	But I do like the concept.
4278280	4280280	I wouldn't take it away from anybody,
4280280	4284280	but I'd really like to go on an inner tube actual river thing
4284280	4287280	where it wasn't a lazy river because actually, ironically,
4287280	4289280	I think that would play on a lot of my social anxieties
4289280	4291280	because it's not lazy in terms of like,
4291280	4294280	if you're going on a figure eight around a hotel,
4294280	4300280	you're like, I'm on the lazy river, but where's Kyle?
4300280	4302280	Kyle was on the lazy river.
4302280	4303280	We went with the guy named Kyle.
4303280	4307280	Am I going to be uncool if I back splash,
4307280	4309280	so I can slow down for Kyle?
4309280	4311280	And he's going to be like, dude, it's a lazy river.
4311280	4313280	Don't be clingy.
4313280	4317280	Or am I supposed to speed ahead and maybe I'll lap Kyle?
4317280	4322280	And then if you're on a business trip, there's eight Kyles.
4322280	4324280	And then you're like, this is no lazy river.
4324280	4327280	Yeah, we got shot down at different times,
4327280	4329280	so I actually was like, oh, am I going to,
4329280	4331280	are they going to get too far ahead of me?
4331280	4332280	I paddled.
4332280	4335280	But for some reason, in my mind, that would be way more doable
4335280	4337280	if you were on our actual river because then it's like,
4337280	4341280	you'd be like, oh, man, I'm way behind or I'm way ahead.
4341280	4345280	And there is no like kind of, you're like, well, that's kind of analogous to life.
4345280	4348280	Is it lazy all year long?
4348280	4350280	I mean, like, if like...
4351280	4361280	There was a CSI Miami where a shark from the shark tank at one resort casino
4361280	4365280	somehow ended up in the lazy river of another casino hotel.
4365280	4368280	That was the cold open.
4368280	4370280	A shark attack in the lazy river.
4370280	4375280	It was like one of the sharks was transplanted into, from one casino's tank...
4375280	4376280	What show was this?
4376280	4378280	I think it was CSI Miami because it was like...
4378280	4380280	There's no way a shark could live in a lazy river.
4380280	4381280	That's David Caruso, right?
4381280	4386280	And then he ended up going like, looks like, you know, I don't know what he would have said.
4386280	4387280	We're going to need a bigger casino.
4387280	4390280	We're going to need a lazier boat.
4390280	4391280	Yeah!
4391280	4394280	But I was like, wow, now I get what...
4394280	4397280	If this is every episode of this fucking show...
4397280	4399280	But wait, why were they in Las Vegas?
4399280	4402280	Why was CSI Miami in Las Vegas?
4402280	4403280	Never mind.
4403280	4405280	Probably a different show.
4405280	4408280	Why did the Brady Bunch go to Hawaii?
4408280	4411280	Why is there an Eiffel Tower in Las Vegas?
4411280	4412280	Hello.
4412280	4415280	Why did the golfer wear two pairs of pants?
4415280	4418280	In case he got a hole in one.
4418280	4419280	What?
4419280	4420280	Damn.
4420280	4422280	He was ready for that.
4422280	4428280	Well, how is y'all's Fourth of July?
4428280	4429280	Did you guys talk about that?
4429280	4431280	Did you talk about that earthquake?
4431280	4433280	We didn't talk about either of those things.
4433280	4434280	We didn't talk about no earthquake.
4434280	4435280	Roll an earthquake, man.
4435280	4437280	You guys ready for that big one?
4437280	4438280	7.1.
4438280	4445280	I spent all morning Saturday going through Kate and I's emergency kits.
4445280	4449280	Where did you keep your emergency kit, Dan?
4449280	4450280	I'll tell you what.
4450280	4451280	My emergency kit's in.
4451280	4452280	I've got a gun.
4452280	4455280	I'll shoot the danger.
4455280	4458280	I'll shoot the plate tectonics.
4458280	4460280	I'll shoot the earthquake.
4460280	4462280	I'll shoot them with my gun.
4462280	4463280	I'll shoot it.
4463280	4464280	Hello, earthquake.
4464280	4466280	I'm going to shoot it.
4466280	4467280	Hello, 7.1.
4467280	4468280	I got a 45.
4468280	4470280	I'm going to shoot you.
4470280	4471280	That's funny.
4471280	4473280	I'm going to shoot the earthquake.
4473280	4474280	7.1.
4474280	4478280	I'll shoot you in the fault line.
4478280	4482280	You guys laugh, but Dan has so much water stored up.
4482280	4485280	You're going to run out of your fucking bags of water in like 20 minutes.
4485280	4492260	But isn't all that water just unhealthy because it's been sitting there in five-gallon plastic
4492260	4493260	jugs forever?
4493260	4494260	Yes.
4494260	4495260	Oh, yeah.
4495260	4497260	You'll certainly die of cancer instead of in the apocalypse.
4497260	4501260	I'll be an old man on a porch teller.
4501260	4507260	And that's before the New California Republic started their double reconstruction.
4507260	4511580	But I'll have like a tumor the size of an eggplant in my shoulder from drinking like
4511580	4512580	sparklets.
4512580	4515260	You can take your gun out and shoot your cancer.
4515260	4519260	They say there's two kinds of earthquakes.
4519260	4521260	Is that too far?
4521260	4523260	That was fucking good, man.
4523260	4524260	Oh, thank you.
4524260	4526260	That was a fucking solid kiss.
4526260	4527260	You are so...
4527260	4529260	That was a good burn, man.
4529260	4531260	You're going to rock it at the fucking Comic Con, man.
4531260	4532260	Thank you so much.
4532260	4533260	You're going to fucking nail it.
4533260	4534260	Thank you so much, man.
4534260	4536260	You are fucking killing it, bro.
4536260	4537260	Oh, man, thank you.
4537260	4538260	Killing it.
4538260	4539260	You're killing it.
4539260	4540260	Killing it.
4540260	4541260	Thank you.
4541260	4542260	I don't know.
4542260	4543260	Thank you.
4543260	4547260	They say there's two kinds of earthquakes.
4547260	4550900	There's like the rumbling rolling thing where you're like sitting there swaying, which is
4550900	4555860	the only kind I've ever experienced because I got here just after the Northridge quake.
4555860	4562580	But the Northridge quake is the other kind where it just goes boom and you're like people
4562580	4563580	fly out of their beds.
4563580	4564620	You were around for that.
4564620	4565620	What was that like?
4565620	4566620	Oh, man.
4566620	4567620	What was that like for you, man?
4567620	4570380	Dude, I would fucking own that one, man.
4570380	4571380	Yeah, right.
4571380	4572380	Tell me.
4572380	4575740	Tell us of the Northridge quake.
4575740	4576740	What time of day was the Northridge quake?
4576740	4577900	Was it nighttime or daytime?
4577900	4579900	Well, we weren't here yet.
4579900	4580900	Daytime.
4580900	4584460	There was one where I was in the shower and nearly broke my neck.
4584460	4591700	It jolted and I completely took a spill in the shower and got up and everything was just
4591700	4593420	warping and bending.
4593420	4594980	That was a fucking bad one.
4594980	4595980	That might have been Northridge.
4595980	4596980	That would suck.
4596980	4597980	That would suck.
4597980	4598980	No, no, no.
4598980	4600380	That was the Whittier-Narrows one.
4600380	4603820	I lived in Whittier for the Whittier-Narrows one and that was like we were pretty close
4603820	4605940	to the epicenter of that one.
4605940	4615260	And I remember driving to school that day and I looked at buildings and all the glass
4615260	4616860	and the windows was just waving.
4616860	4618460	It was really wild.
4618460	4619460	Now, okay.
4619460	4620460	Answer some meow.
4620460	4621460	Meow.

4642480	4643480	You're saying you're sorry.
4643480	4646980	These fucking stools are the most uncomfortable things.
4646980	4648480	I'm saying they're pieces of shit.
4648480	4649480	These suck ass.
4649480	4650480	Pieces of shit.
4650480	4651480	You're fucking terrible.
4651480	4652480	You're fucking.
4652480	4653480	Give me a stool.
4653480	4654480	This thing's.
4654480	4655480	70 episodes.
4655480	4656480	Who bought these fucking.
4656480	4657480	You can't get cushions on the goddamn shit.
4657480	4658480	Fucking horrible.
4658480	4659900	We probably took those from like the other show.
4659900	4660900	Yeah.
4660900	4661900	We've always used those.
4661900	4664980	No one's supposed to be sitting in those longer than an hour.
4664980	4665980	Go ahead, dad.
4665980	4666980	What are you saying?
4666980	4667980	Like a high chair full of pain.
4667980	4670780	Well, here are some, here's a new segment.
4670780	4673860	It's called Dan Harmon's- A kiddie.
4673860	4676120	Earthquake suppositions.
4676120	4677120	Music sting.
4677120	4678120	Music sting.
4678120	4679120	Dan Harmon's earthquake suppositions.
4679120	4680120	Meow.
4680120	4681120	Meow.
4681120	4682120	Meow.
4682120	4683120	Meow.
4683120	4684120	Yeah.
4684120	4685120	Yeah.
4685120	4686120	Okay.
4686120	4687120	Yeah.
4687120	4688120	Meow.
4688120	4689120	Meow.
4689120	4690120	Meow.
4690120	4691120	Meow.
4691120	4692120	Meow.
4692120	4693120	Meow.
4693120	4694120	Meow.
4694260	4695260	Okay.
4695260	4696260	All right.
4696260	4697260	Good theme song.
4697260	4699920	I think that this segment's gonna be coming back just for the.
4699920	4701880	Yeah, this already has legs.
4701880	4702880	Might be one of those.
4702880	4703880	Yeah.
4703880	4704880	We'll end it.
4704880	4705880	We'll end it segment too.
4705880	4710240	Here's a couple of things in my old age that I've come to assume about earthquakes.
4710240	4711240	Number one.
4711240	4713000	How many are there by the way?
4713000	4714000	I don't know.
4714000	4715000	I don't know.
4715000	4716000	Sorry.
4716000	4717000	But we can say seven.
4717000	4718000	And if I got a riff.
4718000	4719000	You want to count it down.
4719000	4721000	You want to count it up from one, two, two.
4721000	4722000	All right.
4722000	4723000	Let's do seven.
4723400	4726400	Dan Harmon's seven earthquake supposition.
4726400	4727400	Hit it Zach.
4727400	4728400	Dan Harmon's seven.
4728400	4729400	Meow.
4729400	4730400	Earthquake supposition.
4730400	4731400	Hey girl.
4731400	4735200	Do you ever have six suppositions about something?
4735200	4736200	Meow.
4736200	4737200	Guess what?
4737200	4740200	You just got a plus one.
4740200	4741200	Meow.
4741200	4742200	Yo.
4742200	4743200	Meow.
4743200	4752560	My name is Bad Dog Johnson and I just got out of the joint I'm gonna ring.
4752560	4754800	Why did they let Bad Dog Johnson out?
4754800	4755800	Wait.
4755800	4757960	What was Bad Dog Johnson in for?
4757960	4758960	I don't know.
4758960	4761480	Was it rape?
4761480	4765000	If you were listening to that theme song I think what you heard is commonly known in
4765000	4771560	the audio industry is that was a glitch where you're actually hearing a tale on a recording
4771560	4777520	session where sometimes the theme song for a segment actually also was used by a record
4777520	4782120	label for what they call walk-ins.
4783120	4788960	And I guess the Bad Dog Johnson I guess you heard a little more than we bargained for.
4788960	4793040	When you buy your theme song your segments themes in bulk you end up with a couple pig
4793040	4795160	anuses in your calamari.
4795160	4800880	Like the cheaper it is like the more it is like same shape and then it's like I guess
4800880	4804760	that's what we were hearing there and I don't know if it'll be in the final edit but yeah
4804760	4808240	I have the same questions as you.
4808240	4809240	Why did they let him out?
4809240	4810640	How did he make Pearl?
4810640	4817480	Why was he like I'll put myself on the shoes of Bad Dog Johnson if I've just gotten released
4817480	4823920	from prison I'm certainly not going to rap about my upcoming rape.
4823920	4828960	And that's the other question of course is that what he said I'm gonna rape it was kind
4828960	4835640	of saw like it's certainly what he said it's Bad Dog Johnson was he like second guessing
4836440	4842360	I actually just went to the court file to raise up he was only in the he was only in
4842360	4849400	prison for tax fraud but but yeah I got institutionalized and now he's gonna go out and commit a serious
4849400	4852480	that's why it's important to know what he was in for right because we don't want to
4852480	4857680	judge convicts if they got out but if he was in for tax evasion yeah and he got out for
4857680	4863080	good behavior then there's probably a misunderstanding happening here Bad Dog Johnson he just admitted
4863080	4868920	he was going to go rape people but but if he was in for murder and he wasn't supposed
4868920	4874360	to get out right yeah it informs everybody yeah well look all right revolving door we
4874360	4880560	buy in volume here okay all right so anyway the segment is Dan Harmon's top seven earthquake
4880560	4886000	suppositions top seven earthquake suppositions all right number seven number seven we're
4886000	4894520	coming in hot number seven Dan Harmon's top seven earthquake suppositions I I suppose this
4894520	4906560	is number seven yeah okay that if if you're gonna die in an earthquake by something falling on top
4906560	4916440	of you that that's also how you're gonna wake up that that that that like in my 30s I was very
4916440	4921160	scared about oh god the big earthquake and it's like oh my god shit can fall on you and now in my
4921160	4927320	40s I'm kind of like wait a minute like you're there's two kinds of earthquakes there's like
4927320	4932480	rock and roll and like that those are damaging we see the grocery stores and like the fucking
4932480	4938800	ragu is falling everywhere that fatalities can occur in the rolling thunder thing I mean
4938800	4943720	that is a huge amount of fucking motion when I think of all the lost ragu but those but the
4943720	4950720	earthquakes that result in like I think in like disasters like a global it where things are
4950720	4956280	collapsed I this is my supposition that you're gonna wait as I didn't research it at all this
4956280	4967920	is my supposition is that those society profits we have six more of these you guys who made that
4967920	4976240	fucking straw sound who did that who went come on own it and okay what did you was that critical
4976240	4982480	or were you kind of like just I don't want to I don't want to tell you what to tell me but if you
4982480	4992360	can if you can just pretend that it was saying you and it was like it was it's okay if it was
4992360	4999840	mostly can you do the sound again because I missed it I missed it too yeah okay okay that's what I
4999840	5005080	wanted to hear is it I'll own one half of it is that is that you were kind of like Jesus Christ
5005080	5010360	this fucking fat idiot yeah but if I want you to just Paul bear the other half where you're like
5010360	5016800	also I've had a lot of coronas I'm like I don't need this yeah fucking bros see okay I just need
5016800	5021720	what was the sound that you all right let me get back to those like an exhale I I think that in an
5021720	5026480	earthquake that's gonna fucking kill you by dropping shit on your head I'm not saying don't
5026480	5030880	prepare for earthquakes I'm just saying in a nihilistic sense I think what they're not telling
5030880	5035920	us is that when the earthquakes that big like no amount of shoes and flashlights next to your bed
5035920	5042480	are gonna stop you from having a cinder block on your head like like it that is how you wake up in
5042480	5047480	an earthquake that kills you is the thing waking up you you're waking up dead because the cinder
5047480	5053080	block is on you ice and I say that optimistically because I think a lot of our worst nightmares are
5053080	5058840	like thoughts of like where people are like because we hear survivors horror story number
5058840	5068600	six okay thank you are you are now we were you sobering me up and you're moving it on and we're
5068600	5074680	like yeah we need each other I could use a guy to kick my ass around here and it should be my
5074680	5082400	shadow self you you you you you look you I can only see your silhouette but you're basically me
5082400	5087160	except you're less afraid of the color turquoise like that's all I know about you like I'm just like
5087160	5093240	I could never take that risk like that's too outgoing and you're like I'm not on stage I don't care
5093240	5098040	turquoise give me a turquoise shirt you fuck I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm
5098040	5110800	kidding I'm kidding number six okay number six fuck I think I'm out of them okay all right number
5110800	5116560	six you could do a speed round from six to two number six there's no such thing as earthquake
5116560	5124400	weather that's not a thing number five number five the the thing that you really need to be
5124400	5132600	afraid of is called liquefaction it's it's when you're in a like a moisture area than dry because
5132600	5138960	earthquakes can then create instant quicksand that will suck your body or house or golf cart
5138960	5146520	instantly down or golf cart into the earth and as quickly as it happens the dirt reconstitutes
5146520	5154320	is dirt you are fucking Han Solo to live and it's going to happen to Portland I think Han Solo was
5154320	5169240	Han Solo to live too okay well that's just number four number four earthquakes number three okay
5170000	5177800	we're sipping along now I almost breathed out. Earthquakes are like when people start worrying
5177800	5187840	about aftershocks as long as the as long as the next one isn't bigger you're done if the first one
5187840	5195160	didn't destroy anything and then the second one is smaller than the first one take take that string
5195160	5201460	off the back of your TV fucking ride bareback for a while well watch HBO was like a fucking
5201460	5212840	unearthquake proof TV. Who puts a string on a TV? I've never been more embarrassed for you in my life
5212840	5222880	do you have a string on your TV? Fuck no but but I'm just okay but this guy started a sentence by
5222880	5227880	meowing earlier so am I gonna fucking take this quick prep. There was an earthquake and then they
5227880	5233800	remember when they said like that was a foreshock not an aftershock because the next one was bigger
5233800	5240320	yeah and we were like fuck that was the time to panic because it was like is this a foreshock
5240320	5246760	it could be we won't know until the next one's even better but if the next one's smaller you
5246760	5259760	can jump into a lattice of jumper cables that are all gingerly arranged to only make contact with
5259760	5264440	the leads that touch your body where do you put the string on the TV and what are you putting the
5264440	5271120	string you're supposed to just anchor your tipable furniture to the wall with a screw in a stud this
5271120	5277840	is for especially for people that have you know kids and pets like because a relatively non
5277840	5285280	disastrous earthquake can tip a bookcase which can be a this isn't funny Steve I'm looking at Spencer
5285280	5303040	I'm not this isn't easy to agree with you number two number two we are we are two away from the Dan
5303040	5316320	Hammond's top seven suppositions about earthquake dying and the number one earthquake supposition
5316320	5330520	it's not it I the important things to have for an earthquake have less you should have
5330520	5343320	condoms and like a lot of shoes I truly think a gun is a good thing because then you just like
5343320	5348960	roll into a fucking store and be like give me all this stuff it's an earthquake I need this
5348960	5354920	for my family have you ever have you ever fired your gun actually no he's afraid that it'll explode
5354920	5362320	I cleaned it it's a deadly weapon it's a good way out the barrel right that's what my you're
5362320	5367240	afraid that you cleaned it wrong and you might have cleaned it wrong why did you clean if you
5367280	5375880	haven't fired it you I always wanted to clean a gun so never wanted to fire one what kind of gun
5375880	5384680	is it it's a Glock clean and broken I'm sure of it clean and dangerous huh all right number one
5384680	5393120	earthquake supposition yeah I just learned that gas lines have earthquake sensors on them yeah
5393200	5400440	Dan's Dan's hot water went out and we didn't know why and I called a guy and he was like I'm gonna
5400440	5405440	check your earthquake sensor and I was like the what now and he's like yeah all these houses they
5405440	5411080	got earthquake sensors on them and I was like well that's that's the great idea actually and it turns
5411080	5418000	out that the electronics guys were jackhammering or some such on on the outside walkway to lay some
5418000	5424240	cable and that tremor sensation tripped the the earthquake sensor and turned off the gas to the
5424240	5432080	house it didn't turn off imagine those poor earthquake sensors yeah that story those guys
5432080	5439120	imagine imagine that Pixar movie earthquake sensors exclamation point did you know earthquake
5439120	5445840	sensors have a secret world of their own and there's a one-for-one analogy of a lot of the
5445840	5452640	problems that you and I have and Tony earthquake sensor is like Tony the earthquake sensor there
5452640	5460960	that cried wolf he's like guys guys there's an earthquake and it's like wah-wah as the Randy
5460960	5466440	Newman song starts it's like a reveal that yet again it's just a guy installing cable oh you got
5466440	5477400	a tender touch oh you got a sensitivity oh you the first to know about my love for you because you
5477400	5484680	know you got a hair trigger for you and you for me ah yeah da da da da da da da da da da da da da da the
5484680	5492640	council of earthquake sensor elders will now review the case of Tony once again i roll i roll i roll
5492640	5497640	I'm a professional sensor and I'm picking up on your eye rolls.
5497640	5501640	Yeah, that's not ironic. You pick up on, yeah, okay.
5501640	5504640	Never mind. We'll workshop that bit.
5504640	5507640	We should pick up on more stuff. Yes, we should have less of an eye roll.
5507640	5510640	Yes, okay, fucking. Let's be on the same team.
5510640	5513640	Tony, come forth and explain yourself.
5513640	5515640	Hey, guys, come sorry.
5515640	5519640	Look, I really thought the earth was shaking and my job was to turn off the gas.
5519640	5522640	Who was celebrities voicing Tony?
5522640	5525640	Bill Hader. Bill Hader, all right.
5525640	5533640	And then they're like, Tony, we sentence you to re-education camp.
5533640	5538640	You will follow the unused gas lines that run underneath.
5538640	5542640	Oh, dear. I'm sorry.
5542640	5545640	When I hear camp and gas, I went to...
5545640	5548640	No, you should. This thing is not here to...
5548640	5551640	Pixar sucks. It's not called show friends.
5551640	5554640	Go ahead. It's Pixar.
5554640	5557640	You were a character in the movie.
5557640	5560640	You were like the producer watching a screen test going,
5560640	5563640	Oh, no. I'm Jack Raffy going,
5563640	5565640	Whoa, boy. Holy shit.
5565640	5567640	Wow, why didn't we catch that?
5567640	5570640	My family died in the Holocaust. Yikes.
5570640	5573640	I'm so proud of them. There's a deep cut,
5573640	5576640	but there was a community season that was on Yahoo,
5576640	5579640	and there was an episode where Steve Guttenberg played this guy
5579640	5582640	that was a producer, and there was this whole thing about this movie,
5582640	5586640	Abbot Made. My favorite thing was that there's the second act.
5586640	5590640	Steve Guttenberg is this producer character watching on a laptop,
5590640	5593640	the kind of the Abbot movie.
5593640	5597640	And I just love the discovery of he should be really into it.
5597640	5600640	The story doesn't have to turn on him being like,
5600640	5605640	he just got all these reactions from Guttenberg
5605640	5608640	watching this movie that Abbot made, and he's just like,
5608640	5611640	Oh, God. And to me it's really funny,
5611640	5614640	because it's vulnerable and funny. It's like comedy
5614640	5617640	where it's like everybody wins. He's really into the movie.
5617640	5621640	So what is the tone of the censor act one?
5621640	5624640	Well, okay. So I want to do a little retconning here,
5624640	5627640	because I got a little... I think they sentence him
5627640	5630640	to be like a sprinkler censor or something.
5630640	5633640	But then there's an actual emergency.
5633640	5636640	So there's a real earthquake, and no one will listen to him.
5636640	5637640	We know that story.
5637640	5638640	Because he's cried wolf to many times.
5638640	5640640	But then because of where he is positioned,
5640640	5643640	so he's been sent to be a sprinkler censor,
5643640	5649640	and so he is actually privy to the fact that an earthquake is coming.
5649640	5652640	So this is a fun action movie thing.
5652640	5655640	What's it called? San Fernando with The Rock,
5655640	5656640	or whatever he's going on.
5656640	5657640	San Andreas.
5657640	5662640	Yeah, it's like he's... I thought it was more local.
5662640	5663640	San Fernando.
5663640	5664640	With The Rock.
5664640	5667640	The decommissioned roller rink is not going to have enough arugula
5667640	5669640	unless I rescue my girlfriend.
5669640	5673640	I've got to get past this film development lab.
5673640	5675640	San Fernando jokes.
5675640	5686640	It's a movie that introduced the world to San Fernando Boulevard culture.
5686640	5689640	San Fernando Boulevard.
5689640	5691640	That famous boulevard.
5691640	5692640	All right.
5692640	5694640	Street, what is it? What do you...
5694640	5698640	So now there's a real emergency.
5698640	5700640	He works now as a sprinkler censor.
5700640	5703640	So there's an earthquake coming, and it's like the earthquake has...
5703640	5706640	I do not want to do a Bugs Life here, because I stopped watching Bugs Life
5706640	5711640	when it was like, wait, you mean the fucking protagonist caused the problem?
5711640	5713640	That's going to send him...
5713640	5716640	No, I don't know likey.
5716640	5720640	I was like, I'm not going to watch a bunch of bugs go through a lot of shit
5720640	5724640	that challenges them because Dave Foley's character did something wrong,
5724640	5727640	and then was like, guess we got to do a thing now.
5727640	5729640	Clean up your message, baby.
5729640	5730640	But isn't that risky business?
5730640	5733640	Didn't Tom Cruise do something wrong, and he had to fix his own problem?
5733640	5734640	No.
5734640	5735640	No, sir.
5735640	5736640	No.
5736640	5737640	No.
5737640	5738640	No.
5738640	5741640	Tom Cruise is risky business.
5741640	5744640	His parents are leaving, and they're like, be a good boy or whatever.
5744640	5745640	He's...
5745640	5749640	But he creates a crisis of his own design,
5749640	5752640	and has to grow up and fix his own problem, doesn't he?
5752640	5757640	Yeah, but he didn't make his parents leave town.
5757640	5760640	But maybe that's why they left town,
5760640	5761640	because they fucking...
5761640	5763640	Who wants to hang out with Tom Cruise all the fucking time?
5763640	5768640	That would be a less enjoyable story,
5768640	5769640	which is why I...
5769640	5773640	I've never seen Bugs' Life.
5773640	5776640	What did Dave Foley do in Bugs' Life that created his own problem?
5776640	5780640	I feel like he forgot to put out the grasshopper bird seeds or something.
5780640	5782640	No, no, they were collecting all the food,
5782640	5784640	and then he fucked it all up.
5784640	5785640	It all went into the river.
5785640	5788640	Yeah, and it's like, you dumb fuck.
5788640	5790640	And then he's like, well, boy, I guess I gotta be Willow now.
5790640	5792640	You're not Willow.
5792640	5793640	God damn.
5793640	5795640	All right, anyways, whatever.
5795640	5796640	Okay, so...
5796640	5797640	Stick with me.
5797640	5800640	You'll write a million movies.
5800640	5801640	I suck.
5801640	5802640	I suck worse than anything.
5802640	5804640	That's why I'm so cynical.
5804640	5806640	All right, can we get back to what we were talking about?
5806640	5807640	Sprinkler sensor.
5807640	5808640	Now we've got...
5808640	5810640	Okay, so the sprinkler sensor, like, yeah.
5810640	5811640	Well, I want to be careful here,
5811640	5813640	because I want to make sure you resonate with this character.
5813640	5815640	Like, you want them to be like...
5815640	5817640	He's been demoted from earthquake sensor...
5817640	5820640	So they know the earthquake's coming, and then it's like, they...
5820640	5821640	Fuck.
5821640	5823640	I mean, we've got to put a pin in some stuff here.
5823640	5824640	But...
5824640	5827640	And skip to the idea that what ends up happening,
5827640	5830640	because I like this device I created, is there's like an ancient...
5830640	5831640	Oh, God.
5831640	5833640	There's a lower tech...
5833640	5838640	Back when California was still being tamed...
5838640	5840640	Excuse my belching.
5840640	5843640	There was like...
5843640	5849640	The water and the gas used to come in the same tubes,
5849640	5852640	and there was less room for alarm.
5852640	5855640	It's like a regression to a more primitive world.
5855640	5858640	Yeah, and you got John Huston from Chinatown,
5858640	5860640	and he's talking about how...
5860640	5866640	It's like Flushed Away meets Chinatown meets...
5867640	5870640	Rango? What's the guy? What's the lizard?
5870640	5871640	Yeah.
5871640	5872640	Yeah.
5872640	5873640	John and Deb played Rango.
5873640	5877640	That had some problems that you could fix with this.
5877640	5879640	I like the tone, and then you got...
5879640	5882640	He's like, oh, man, I can't believe I'm in a deeper tube.
5882640	5883640	So now that...
5883640	5888640	He's been demoted from high tech to more analog, more old tech.
5888640	5890640	But that puts him more in touch with the actual...
5890640	5893640	So he just wants to contribute, so he's like always going like,
5893640	5895640	hey, something's shaking.
5895640	5897640	And they're always telling him, hey, pick your battles.
5897640	5899640	Your job's not to rock the boat.
5899640	5901640	And he's like, but I'm an earthquake sensor.
5901640	5904640	And they're like, yeah, you can't just see earthquakes everywhere.
5904640	5906640	So then a real earthquake...
5906640	5908640	I think it's got to be him actually being like,
5908640	5910640	oh, that can't be an earthquake.
5910640	5913640	And for that reason, he bothers to show up for work,
5913640	5914640	and no one else does.
5914640	5917640	So there's like a kind of Simon Peggy kind of like...
5917640	5920640	Shaun of the Dead thing where he's naive for a segment,
5920640	5922640	and you're kind of like, oh, that poor guy.
5922640	5925640	So there's been an evacuation, home alone.
5925640	5929640	And so that's why he ends up like the only earthquake sensor
5929640	5934640	in a community where it really needs to...
5934640	5936640	Where earthquakes need to be sensed.
5936640	5939640	So what's the meeting with the goddess here?
5939640	5944640	Where are we at in the stories arc right now?
5944640	5948640	I mean, the meeting of the goddess is he senses an earthquake, isn't it?
5948640	5952640	I think it's that he senses the destruction of a new unlikely family
5952640	5955640	that he builds in a new community.
5955640	5958640	So you have to think about what is the opposite of an earthquake sensor
5958640	5961640	aesthetically and maybe not, if not purposefully.
5961640	5966640	There's no such thing as like an earthquake sensor
5966640	5968640	on the earthquake side.
5968640	5971640	Earthquakes don't have their own sensors.
5971640	5974640	Could there be a character that is the earthquake?
5974640	5977640	Can you anthropomorphize the actual earthquake?
5977640	5980640	Like fern-gully.
5980640	5984640	Well, you could in the form of someone with a mental disorder
5984640	5987640	that was like a human earthquake, like a character earthquake.
5987640	5990640	They're unpredictable, they're uncontrollable.
5990640	5993640	And so what our protagonist is learning is
5993640	5998640	it's not about the false dichotomy of alarmism versus stagnation.
5998640	6001640	It's about mirroring and sensitivity.
6001640	6005640	He needs to become a person sensor.
6005640	6008640	And when he thinks that there is a crisis...
6008640	6010640	We all do, Dan. We all do.
6010640	6013640	It's true, but it's not a zero-sum game
6013640	6016640	in terms of whether or not everyone needs to do something.
6016640	6020640	He needs to realize that he's like the most sensitive earthquake sensor of all.
6020640	6024640	But there has to be something that he was not sensitive to
6024640	6027640	that he has to become more sensitive to about himself
6027640	6029640	or about somebody that's important to him.
6029640	6031640	His own self-esteem, maybe?
6031640	6033640	Maybe, yeah.
6034640	6037640	Or maybe like his mother or some other character.
6037640	6041640	He's like, wow, my job is to be sensitive,
6041640	6046640	and yet look how insensitive I've been to the people that matter most to me.
6046640	6051640	I told Spencer today that my therapist asked me to start taking showers.
6053640	6055640	Me and Dan have the same therapist.
6055640	6057640	We're at the same wall in therapy now.
6057640	6058640	He started seeing my therapist.
6058640	6061640	But my therapist is like a super person that I was like,
6061640	6064640	man, she saved my life, but I think she's just hitting that wall
6064640	6066640	because she's like, goddamn, this dude's perfect
6066640	6069640	except he's fucking dirty and gross.
6069640	6071640	She's got nothing, no bubble left to pop.
6071640	6074640	Was she saying because I have another client coming in
6074640	6077640	and you need to start taking showers or I have to start buying more for breeze?
6077640	6079640	It started the UTI conversation where I was like,
6079640	6081640	I got a UTI and she's kind of like, what were you,
6081640	6084640	in a fucking weird public pool in the middle of a fucking dump?
6084640	6087640	And I was like, I don't know how I got a UTI,
6087640	6089640	and she's kind of like, how many showers do you take?
6089640	6092640	I was kind of like, where's this going? God damn.
6092640	6093640	Can I ask how many showers you take?
6093640	6095640	I take a shower every time I work out.
6095640	6097640	I work out every other day.
6097640	6100640	That is 10,000 times more showers than I ever have taken in my life.
6100640	6103640	Because there's been times when you've gone weeks and months without beer.
6103640	6104640	Sure.
6104640	6105640	And people are shocked by that.
6105640	6107640	And then I was like, I started working out and I'm like,
6107640	6109640	oh, now I don't mind taking a shower because after a workout,
6109640	6112640	I'm like, jeez, I don't want this to be the case.
6112640	6117640	And then I just, I have this like almost inarticulable outrage
6117640	6119640	that I know is now in fashion anymore.
6119640	6123640	And it's this idea of people being like,
6123640	6127640	it's okay that you're fascinated by like, oh, what?
6127640	6129640	You don't want to take a shower.
6129640	6134640	But will you just fucking think about how much you want to take a shower,
6134640	6137640	which is probably a lot if you're doing it all the time.
6137640	6139640	And that's not an accomplishment.
6139640	6142640	You're not fucking disciplined.
6142640	6144640	Fuck you, you fucking shower addict.
6144640	6146640	You're just a fucking shower person.
6146640	6148640	Like you don't get a medal for that.
6148640	6150640	And, but you also don't get shit on for that.
6150640	6151640	Like I don't, I know.
6151640	6153640	I'm never like fucking shower people actually,
6153640	6154640	problematically enough.
6154640	6156640	Like as I was developing, yeah, I did.
6156640	6158640	I was like fucking shower people,
6158640	6160640	which is like, that's a whammy.
6160640	6163640	You don't want to put on a guy that can fucking hurt you or help you.
6163640	6165640	And like, I'm like, I go down.
6165640	6167640	I'm like, I think it's like, I was like,
6167640	6168640	I'm working out every other day.
6168640	6170640	So I'm like, this is like a million times more showers than I've ever taken.
6170640	6173640	And now my therapist is like, she's like, it's like,
6173640	6175640	I'm sure I'm trying to explain to her.
6175640	6179640	I'm like, like, look, man, like if you're hanging out, you know,
6179640	6181640	like if you wake up in the morning and you're like,
6181640	6187640	I can't believe my body's been in this dirty bed for eight hours.
6187640	6188640	Great.
6188640	6193640	I'm so proud of you for feeling that way about your dirt level when you wake
6193640	6194640	up.
6194640	6198640	And I'm so extra proud of you for like, like having that,
6198640	6202640	that carrying you like a fucking black stallion to the,
6202640	6205640	to the fucking Kentucky Derby.
6205640	6210640	Like, like, like your destiny lies in you going into your tiled room of your
6210640	6214640	choosing and turning that knob and just rubbing that water all over you.
6214640	6215640	I mean, wow.
6215640	6219640	I mean, if you're not a fucking hero, I don't know who is.
6219640	6220640	Wait a minute.
6220640	6223640	I'm being sarcastic shower in my sarcasm.
6223640	6226640	It's as available as the fucking water that I,
6226640	6230640	you are not remarkable for desiring to be cascading over you.
6230640	6232640	I find it to be fucking weird.
6232640	6237640	I'm like, I, if, if, if, if I haven't wrestled with a turd in the last eight
6237640	6242640	hours, I'm waking up in a clean bed and wrestled with a turd.
6242640	6245640	You've done like, I didn't jog.
6245640	6247640	I'm not like, I don't want feeling dirty.
6247640	6249640	I'm not like doing the same.
6249640	6252640	And I'm like, it's just, it, I'm not, I'm not, it's like, it's not,
6252640	6255640	it feels like I'm going to go into this cold tiled room,
6255640	6259640	which like looks like the jigsaw room and like, like, like,
6259640	6262640	like everything's tile and it's like clinical.
6262640	6265640	It's like, like your dogs don't go in the bathroom.
6265640	6266640	You know why?
6266640	6268640	It's like a vet's office lately.
6268640	6271640	Like, like, like you never said to your dog, get out of the bathroom.
6271640	6274640	Like your dog has a natural aversion to the bathroom.
6274640	6276640	They're like, that seems like where you get cut open.
6276640	6278640	But your new house has some really beautiful.
6278640	6279640	Yeah.
6279640	6282640	And I'll probably take a million showers and then I'll be president and that'll
6282640	6284640	make me a great person.
6284640	6286640	You've like the jig is up people.
6286640	6288640	I know you're full of shit.
6288640	6292640	I really think, I really think people who take showers are more disciplined
6292640	6293640	though.
6293640	6296640	Like, I think all the things that you could say,
6296640	6299640	I think they're definitely, it's like, you know, the military, it's like,
6299640	6301640	oh, you got to make your bed when you get up.
6301640	6305640	Like, I think it really is like this regimen that they're like resigned to
6305640	6307640	and that just have good habits.
6307640	6308640	Right.
6308640	6309640	Yeah.
6309640	6310640	That's what it's a habit.
6310640	6311640	It's a good.
6311640	6312640	Yeah.
6312640	6313640	So it's like, who fucking cares?
6313640	6315640	So I got a habit that looks different from your habit,
6315640	6317640	but then the people with the ha they're like,
6317640	6321640	so don't you think you, don't you think maybe you're,
6321640	6325640	you don't have my habits because you're unhappy?
6325640	6327640	That could very well be true, man.
6327640	6330640	Like, I like, that's definitely worth peeking into.
6330640	6332640	Let's talk about neglect.
6332640	6337640	And like, I assume like, like maybe taking your body into a fucking weird
6337640	6340640	operating room and like spraying it with water,
6340640	6342640	just so you can like dry it back off,
6342640	6345640	get on the bus and have a fucking dude with a crew cut go like,
6345640	6346640	whoa.
6346640	6347640	Whoa.
6347640	6349640	Fucking like nerd faggot took a shower.
6349640	6352640	Dude, give me five.
6352640	6358640	I like, I'm positive that the fact that I'm not into that,
6358640	6362640	like means I'm unhappier than you.
6362640	6364640	Like great.
6364640	6365640	Unpack it at will.
6365640	6369640	But like, stop patting yourself on the back.
6369640	6370640	Did you just say stop?
6370640	6371640	He said shrub.
6371640	6372640	Oh, shrub.
6372640	6373640	Well, fuck you for saying either.
6373640	6374640	That's just bad.
6374640	6375640	Or anything.
6375640	6378640	Like it's just saying ketchup would be a bad idea.
6378640	6379640	That would be better.
6379640	6380640	Elling stuff out.
6380640	6384640	Is it the act of starting the shower and crossing that threshold,
6384640	6387640	like the effort it takes to start the process of getting into a shower?
6387640	6388640	Yeah.
6388640	6389640	Or do you not like the actual...
6389640	6391640	That's what I think the discipline comes from.
6391640	6394640	Do you not enjoy the actual hot water like raining down on you?
6394640	6395640	I do.
6395640	6399640	I do if the alternative is being covered in sweat and dirt.
6399640	6400640	Okay.
6400640	6402640	Then I'm like, I wish this was off of me.
6402640	6405640	Time to solve that problem with water all over my body.
6405640	6407640	I don't feel that way about like...
6407640	6408640	Lolly's the same way.
6408640	6410640	She's just not like...
6410640	6411640	That's Rob's dog.
6411640	6416640	She does not like being in the bathtub, getting a bath.
6416640	6417640	She hates it.
6417640	6418640	She hates it.
6418640	6419640	She hates it.
6419640	6422640	But once it's done, she's super happy.
6422640	6423640	She's running around.
6423640	6424640	Okay.
6424640	6425640	She's smiling.
6425640	6426640	She's...
6426640	6430640	So is that everyone or is Lolly just me?
6430640	6434640	Is everyone here going like, I hate it too.
6434640	6437640	I hate it too, but I still do it, little trooper.
6437640	6438640	No.
6438640	6439640	Every morning I take that bullet.
6439640	6440640	I think it's more like that.
6440640	6442640	You don't do shit that requires anything of you.
6442640	6443640	You're not a testing person.
6443640	6445640	I don't pay Lolly every day.
6445640	6446640	But you also have a...
6446640	6448640	You have a fiance and a girlfriend and a love of your life.
6448640	6451640	And don't you want to be clean when you guys are making smoochy towns?
6451640	6452640	Yeah.
6452640	6453640	And I don't...
6453640	6454640	I don't...
6454640	6455640	I don't...
6455640	6457640	I'm conscious of that.
6457640	6458640	Like I don't...
6458640	6459640	Yeah.
6459640	6460640	I don't...
6460640	6461640	No more bubble baths.
6461640	6465120	You had a bubble bath phase where you were...
6465120	6466120	No more bubble baths.
6466120	6467120	No more bubble baths.
6467120	6470120	You don't do that anymore?
6470120	6471120	Not lately.
6471120	6472120	Yeah.
6472120	6475080	But you were pretty excited about bathing for a while.
6475080	6476080	Yeah, that's true.
6476080	6477080	Yeah.
6477080	6479280	And then you put your butt too close to the jet and you're...
6479280	6480280	It's true.
6480280	6481280	Greatest hits.
6481280	6482280	Greatest hits?
6482280	6483280	You filled yourself up like a water balloon.
6483280	6484280	Clearly accident.
6484280	6485680	You've all been there.
6485680	6488760	You've enamized just so far for the fucking shirt.
6488760	6490520	I'll never forget the text.
6490520	6496320	He goes, Jeff, I flew a little too close to the sun.
6496320	6498840	It was bad.
6498840	6502640	You're the Icarus of masturbating to a jacuzzi jet.
6502640	6505160	I remember running over to the toilet and I sat on it and it was like...
6505160	6510080	I just heard this bucket come out and I was like, holy shit, that's what an enema is.
6510080	6513880	Because then it was done and I was like, well, it's not bad.
6513880	6514880	That is what an enema is.
6515560	6516960	Yeah, no, no, that is what it is.
6516960	6522960	But it was also there was a residual kind of like, like, violation.
6522960	6523960	Yeah.
6523960	6524960	Like, that's not...
6524960	6526560	Oh, so you didn't empty yourself in the bathtub.
6526560	6527960	You actually made it to the toilet.
6527960	6528960	Yeah.
6528960	6538400	Well, that's the thing is that like, my sphincter relaxed enough for all of a sudden just...
6538400	6539400	It filled instantly.
6539400	6543320	And then the moment it felt something, it snapped shut, I assume.
6543320	6547680	So it wasn't like I could sit in the bathtub and be like, like, and release.
6547680	6550400	It was like, I was like, ah, ah, what happened?
6550400	6551400	What happened?
6551400	6553080	And it puckered up and like kept it.
6553080	6558040	And then I sat on the toilet where my anus must have felt like safe to like, it's like,
6558040	6560160	this is how we do things.
6560160	6564720	And then it just like let out this like unprecedented torrent that I...
6564720	6567880	But it sounded healthy, but it was like, it was like not a sound you associate with your
6567880	6568880	butthole.
6568880	6570400	It was just like a bunch of water coming out.
6570400	6572600	And I was like, oh, paint me.
6572600	6575560	I'm so French.
6575560	6579600	Paint for us the physical picture of what led up to that.
6579600	6584680	You were on your hands and knees with your butt against the edge of the tub and there's
6584680	6587280	a jet going into your butt.
6587280	6591680	And you're masturbating because you're getting tantalized with the jet.
6591680	6592680	And then you press...
6592680	6597560	Because I remember you saying for a few days, like, I found out the best thing in the world.
6597560	6601160	I just put my butthole next to the thing and it teases your...
6601160	6602160	It tickles the rim.
6602200	6605440	You can see what this bathing thing is all about.
6605440	6606840	I finally get it.
6606840	6607840	That is what...
6607840	6608840	Yeah.
6608840	6609840	But as you said...
6609840	6610840	I am on record there.
6610840	6614120	Like Icarus, you flew too close to the sun and your feathers melted and you fucking...
6614120	6616040	It's ironic because I start...
6616040	6620400	My Kinsey scale started to like probably drift.
6620400	6625200	I was like, hey, maybe you're a guy that likes a little bit of butt play.
6625200	6626200	Who the fuck...
6626200	6629560	It doesn't put you in a category of people, you're just a dude taking a bath and it allowed
6629560	6630960	me to be like, yeah, what the fuck?
6630960	6631960	We're all different.
6632400	6633400	What's the line between...
6633400	6637320	And then the irony is that I got comfortable.
6637320	6644160	I was like, I don't have enough shame to keep my little keister tight as a little drum.
6644160	6648200	It's probably like a sign of you're vulnerable and you're like, you know what?
6648200	6650200	This makes me feel good.
6650200	6651200	Open.
6651200	6652200	Wow.
6652200	6654160	And then it was like, yeah.
6654160	6657120	I just think that's poetic.
6657120	6658360	It's not a...
6658360	6660920	There's no moral to that story but I like that geometry.
6660920	6662680	There's certainly a moral to that story.
6662680	6665840	Well, because my therapist had said to me recently, I thought this was a really powerful
6665840	6666840	lesson.
6666840	6669880	I think I might probably mention this in the podcast, but when I was going through this
6669880	6673520	like writer's block thing and I was like procrastinating and stuff and she said something
6673520	6679520	really important to me because there was just a series of weeks that went by where I was
6679520	6683320	like, you know that thing I said I had an epiphany about last week about writing and
6683320	6685560	how I just need to do this and that, uh-huh.
6685560	6686560	Yeah.
6686560	6689400	And then I was absolutely positive about that when I walked out and then I went and did
6689400	6690400	the same shit.
6690400	6691400	Yeah, I did.
6691400	6692400	Yeah.
6692400	6697800	But it was like she made sure, like because she made sure that that was the place where
6697800	6701960	I could always say that so I would never stop saying it.
6701960	6706920	So it was like, first of all, she had to make sure that my brain understood that this is
6706920	6712720	the place where you come and say, whether it's five times in a row or a thousand times
6712720	6717440	in a row, I walked out of here thinking I know how to write and I went home and I didn't
6717440	6721560	write and I did the same fucking shit and I self-destructed and I ended up not writing
6721560	6725000	anything and I'm back again and it's the same story as last time, even though then we had
6725000	6729200	a 45-minute conversation about how it's all going to change and then I did it again.
6729200	6734400	And that she created this avenue where I could walk to my fucking little heart's content
6734400	6739960	in that direction and like the fourth time I was in her office going like I did it again
6739960	6744720	or it is again or it is again and this time I said, but you know what, it's making me
6744720	6748480	think that you know what I think I'm doing wrong is that I need to do it this way instead
6748480	6749480	of that way.
6749480	6753920	And she said, you know what I think you're doing wrong is that you think that you know
6753920	6763520	how to do it right and that makes you not sit and accept doing it wrong.
6763520	6769240	And like the pressure you put on yourself to be the guy that knows how to do it is going
6769240	6775200	to keep you in an eternity of trying to get it right and you're going to be continually
6775200	6777480	confused that you got it wrong again.
6777480	6782800	And here's what I hear when you say to me, you did it wrong again in spite of all odds.
6782800	6789400	I hear that we're on to something because we decided last two weeks ago that like, oh,
6789400	6790760	it's all about this or that.
6790760	6795560	I think whatever makes you fuck up is scared.
6796360	6800600	You don't walk away from Die Hard because the time lock engages.
6800600	6804040	Like you know you're almost there.
6804040	6806880	You need to drill further.
6806880	6811960	That's another way of saying forgive yourself for fucking up as you have cited the thing
6811960	6816120	you want to change about yourself.
6816120	6820680	Not changing overnight means you're at the site of the construction.
6820680	6825440	Like you're at the spot where a wall needs to be a door.
6825440	6829280	Like an idiot.
6829280	6833360	But then she was like, why is you why do you have dirty dick disease?
6833360	6834360	Why don't you take a shower?
6834360	6837360	You fucking faggot.
6837360	6838360	Cliffhanger.
6838360	6844920	Thank you for coming to Hermanson, everybody.
6844920	6847920	Your comptroller, Rob Shrub.
