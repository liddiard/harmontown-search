0	5600	Oh, yeah.
5600	17760	From the cozy confines of the Starburns Industries recording booth, Harman Town is now in session.
17760	23080	Put your hands together for Steve Levy, everybody.
23080	24940	Hey.
24940	29880	And the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
29880	34880	All right, thank you for waiting.
34880	37440	Can I get a little more of my favorite person in my headphones?
37440	39360	Is it possible to hear myself better?
39360	41360	You want more of me?
41360	46720	I tried to dance around it, but it's me.
46720	50320	Thank you for waiting if you're a subscriber and you're watching.
50320	55680	Sorry, if it came up late, it was my fault I got here late.
55680	58600	And also, you know, here's some apologies.
58600	62880	We'll just start with the show with apologies because this is like our second really official
62880	64040	week doing this out of here.
64040	67480	We did one week where it was like church was running around with a camera.
67480	69960	This is our second week of like, all right, here we go.
69960	71840	We're broadcasting from this booth.
71840	80320	So it's lit like a preschool, you know, and we're going to try to make it a little prettier.
80320	85000	We'll try to come up with a system where we're starting right at eight so that you, the subscribers,
85000	90080	can at least be gaining things from this transitional period, like, okay, at least
90080	93400	I know it's on time now that there's no audience.
93400	97760	Who knows if you like the audience more or hate the audience and are so happy that we're
97760	105840	doing this, but in any case, like, we're in progress, like we're going to keep on like
105840	107240	evolving this.
107240	109080	Is the castle going to be a thing again?
109080	110840	Is that going to get back online?
110840	111840	Yeah.
112200	118280	We are currently as active as human beings possibly could be in trying to legitimize
118280	120640	that space.
120640	122000	It's a bunch of city hall stuff.
122000	128320	Burbank is a city where, you know, parrots are wild.
128320	130880	They have wild parrots in Burbank.
130880	132320	It's a crazy town.
132320	136760	You can still walk in off the street and do a vacuum cleaner repair shop.
136760	139240	Those are my favorite.
139240	150200	It's an old world community underneath a frozen chocolate shell of antiquity and provinciality.
150200	156520	They saw 900 millennials on a sidewalk late at night and they freaked out.
156520	160640	I'm not saying they ... Also, we were in violation of a thousand codes that we didn't know we
160640	161640	were in violation of.
161640	164720	Yet, Chili John's runs unhindered.
164720	170880	That place just deals in diarrhea and yet they're allowed to function freely?
170880	174240	There's a whole process and maybe we can ... I don't know people with a little NPR of us,
174240	178960	but maybe we can make it part of the ... Maybe we can do like remote pieces where we have
178960	181120	Nolan like check in with us.
181120	183960	Basically his full-time job because he used to eat what he killed in terms of booking
183960	186400	the room.
186400	191400	Now he's just a man without a country, so we're paying him as much as we can to make
191400	194440	his job to like get the venue legitimized.
194440	199880	He's like having to interact with city hall people and he's got to go to meetings and
199880	200880	things.
200880	202040	We should be documenting that.
202040	206240	Is it possible for us to take like a little Zune and go out there and like podcast from
206240	208640	city hall while we're trying to clear this crap up?
208640	209640	A Zune?
209640	210640	A Microsoft Zune?
210640	211640	A Microsoft Zune.
211640	214640	Now what's the little recording thing?
214640	215640	A Zoom.
215640	218760	I just hadn't heard the word Zune in a while.
218760	220720	I don't know what they're called.
220720	223200	I like that we have churches hanging out in the booth with us.
223200	224200	Yeah, I like it too.
224960	225960	Hello Church.
225960	226960	Yeah.
226960	231800	Church is wearing her, what can only be described as Matrix trash bag outfit.
231800	236800	I don't know.
236800	241960	As long as we're shining a spotlight on some of the, like Nolan's out there hitting the
241960	249640	hard sweaty streets of Burbank, dodging wild parrots, trying to get our permits back.
249640	256600	It's Dafar Cap to Chris Barof who, you know, we're crammed into Burbank's largest Harman
256600	260400	owned VO booth when we were building the studio.
260400	266920	The room that we're sitting in right now was full of like boxes of social security numbers
266920	271440	and inspirational posters from a failed tax company.
271440	277200	And there was literally a guy in the corner of the room with the last phone plugged into
277200	282400	the wall, no desk standing and basically saying, yeah, I got to call you back into
282400	286280	the phone next to a garbage bin full of everyone's taxes.
286280	290280	I mean, if you were nefarious, if you were a dumpster diver, you could have walked out
290280	294840	of this place with like, it would have been like an Equifax on a very low scale because
294840	298880	probably a bunch of Burbank business owners, social security numbers.
298880	303920	But anyways, this place was a pile of garbage we built and I said, let's build a booth.
303920	307480	You know, the partners at Starburns were like, all right, and we started talking specs
307480	311680	and I was like, guys, one of these days we're going to be podcasting out of this thing.
311680	313480	Make it big.
313480	316040	Still not big enough to podcast out of comfortably.
316040	318000	I mean, not make it look cool.
318000	321120	And Chris is, therefore, my point is Chris is a hero right now.
321120	323520	This is the same size as Howard Stern's little-
323520	325160	Well, I don't think that's true.
325160	329800	I think, you know how it is like in TV, it's like whenever, and I'm sure you at home, you
329800	333600	know how this works when they build a set for your TV show.
333600	335360	It's like, it always looks way too big.
335360	338360	You know, you always go like, show about poor people, why is their house so big?
338360	343000	And then the DP always says, trust me, it's going to look like confined.
343000	346720	I think that the Howard Stern room is probably twice the size of this.
346720	350560	The cameras make it look bigger because have you ever seen the Wheel of Fortune, the actual
350560	352280	physical wheel?
352280	354840	It's tiny.
354840	356220	It's like five feet across.
356220	358000	It looks 20 feet across.
358000	365320	But if you, like everything on TV, the Jeopardy set is like as big as this room, but you put
365320	368640	four cameras in there and you get some angles going and it looks giant.
368640	369640	It's all bullshit.
369640	373480	Well, I mean, you're kind of implying that Chris is doing a bad job because it's like
373480	376880	if it looks cramped in here, then you're saying it's on him.
376880	378640	I've not seen it on camera.
378640	381360	We don't have the same kind of, we don't have Jeopardy cameras in here.
381360	382360	We've got-
382360	386680	Also, our, I think, bottoming off our list of apologies.
386680	392540	Last week, I think we were like, I was in a full on blackout, not so much from drunkenness,
392540	396060	but just from like man shame.
396060	399960	I didn't hear the show, but you told me a little bit about it.
399960	404000	I didn't watch it and I'm afraid to listen to it, but what I do know is that apparently
404000	406680	our faces were behind the microphones the entire time.
406680	408760	I think that people by and large are like, hey, I like it.
408760	410680	I'm a person that listens to the podcast.
410680	416080	I wasn't getting as much, maybe they're getting something indirectly out of the 200 people
416080	419760	in the audience, but then there's other things to be gained from our ability to focus and
419760	420760	things.
420760	421760	I'm sure it's a mixed bag.
421760	429440	I'm sure it's a mixed bag, Aunt Natalie, but your subscribers, so we take you very seriously.
429440	434640	Did you solve sexism and sexual assault last week?
434640	437440	I didn't set out to, I don't know what I said.
437440	441680	I talked for two hours trying to convince people I was a good person, but the important
441680	445800	thing that I wanted to talk about that week was it's time for guys to be having this conversation
445800	453800	with guys and with each other and with themselves.
453800	459160	Having said that, I wanted to confine things to expressing my own self to set an example.
459160	462560	I don't want to say, well, guys are like this and girls are like that, but I'm sure I said
462560	464840	a bunch of that.
464840	471840	What I wanted to do was say, okay, from now on, the rule is we speak for ourselves.
471840	476120	I wanted to just say that's where I'm at.
476120	478480	Consciousness has been upheaved.
478480	479480	That's good.
479480	480820	You have to aerate soil.
480820	484840	You have to chisel the ice when you clean the freezer.
484840	487840	Tightly packed things that you don't have to think about.
487840	495880	They're flawed things, whether your revolution is racial, class-based, gender-based, whatever
495880	505520	it is, however one man, a million man, non-binary, march, whatever the movement is, I think it's
505520	512340	all, as my therapist said, it can all be summed up as consciousness, examining unconsciousness
512340	515120	and saying you need to be examined.
515120	519040	You can't keep ruling from beneath.
519040	523040	I'm sure I'm saying stuff that I already said last week, but as a writer, I celebrate the
523040	524040	unconscious.
524040	526920	There's always the, oh, I'm the grimy monster.
526920	530200	I'm going to teach you that the things that you don't think about are more important than
530200	534520	the things that you do think about, and you're being dishonest with yourself, but narcissism
534520	535520	is out.
535520	537120	It's not fashionable anymore.
537120	538120	Oh, no.
538120	540120	I was just getting good at it.
540120	548080	Because it's okay to be a big baby, but now I think the new rule is, okay, but don't just
548080	553000	brag about it and be like, okay, I'm going to do nothing about this.
553520	555520	Otherwise, I feel like a fossil.
556880	557880	Well, yeah.
557880	558880	I mean, we're dinosaurs.
558880	564120	We're not even that old, but our way of thinking is just not going to do it anymore.
564120	572600	We're not allowed to skate by on the presumption that what we say goes, because that was never
572600	580920	a cool presumption in the first place, but now we have to adjust.
580920	587480	We must adjust our bust.
587480	589720	The bigger, the better, the tighter, the sweaters depend on us.
589720	592400	Hey, can I do a little house cleaning and talk about an issue that I don't know the
592400	593400	answer to?
593400	594400	Okay.
594400	599600	We're sitting here holding some beautiful glassware made by Jane Cook, one of our solid
599600	606560	lifelong harmonians, and yet it's been brought to my attention that she has now left the
606560	607560	fold.
607560	611640	She's boycotting us or what's happening?
611640	612640	I know what you know.
612640	614640	I don't know anything.
614640	615640	I don't.
615640	616640	Yeah.
616640	617640	I don't know.
617640	618640	Was it because of last week?
618640	619640	Because of your?
619640	620640	I don't know.
620640	621640	I don't know.
621640	622640	I would find that hard to believe.
622640	623640	I don't think so.
623640	624640	I think it's possible.
624640	627000	She texted me today and said that she was at the library bar in New York and wished
627000	628000	I was there.
628000	630000	I mean, it's not like she's mad at me.
630000	632760	Maybe she's just mad at you or a harm in town?
632760	634160	Is it definitive?
634160	635880	Is it safe to say she's mad?
635880	636880	I don't know.
637360	638760	I don't know if it is.
638760	639760	What do we know?
639760	641320	I tell you what I know.
641320	645800	I got a text from her saying that she was going to stop listening to the show.
645800	647560	Stop kind of following it.
647560	653680	But she didn't characterize it as a complaint.
653680	658440	But we're used to processing the announcement that you're going to sever a connection with
658440	660280	something as punitive.
660280	664280	But I don't also then the question would be, well, then what would you do if you wanted
664280	667360	to be healthy, an honorable discharge?
667360	669560	What would you do?
669560	673800	She's in a unique position because most people have the luxury of they can just stop listening
673800	674800	to podcasts.
674800	679200	We asked her tonight to come from New York to be on the show to decline.
679200	682120	She didn't have the guts to show up and defend herself.
682120	686480	I think when you look at it from her perspective, I'm going to speak as objectively as possible
686480	690080	without any speculation of her subjective experience.
690080	695440	But I would say as somebody, it's pretty easily observable that she was very entrenched
695440	697200	with the listenership.
697200	703320	She was basically running a kind of unofficial slash official, emotionally official Facebook
703320	706160	group of listeners and all these things.
706160	713320	Like when you're listening is that active, then something that for the rest of us can
713320	716640	just be, forget Game of Thrones, it has to be an announcement.
716640	717640	Yeah.
717640	725080	I've always thought it's kind of like a sign of emotional maturity and awesomeness when
725080	726880	our regular people stopped coming.
726880	731120	Like N.T. doesn't go to the show anymore, once in a while maybe, but a lot of people
731120	734520	just go to the drawing room while we're doing this.
734520	737120	That's their harm in town now is being at the bar.
737120	739080	Some people, yeah, they fill up their little cup.
739080	740400	Who was the Russian guy?
740400	741400	What was it?
741400	742400	Anatoly.
742400	743400	Yeah.
743400	744400	Anatoly used to come.
744760	748840	It's like, and then if you're immature, you go like, oh, so you just wanted attention
748840	752280	and now that you're not a special audience member, now you're just going to bail.
752280	756080	But there's a positive way of saying that, which is, oh, you were a friend of the show
756080	758360	and you experienced the show on a higher level.
758360	765080	But also, if I went to five Grateful Dead concerts, I could go, I've seen enough Grateful
765080	766080	Dead concerts.
766080	769920	And if you were, but if the Grateful Dead brought you up on stage for three of the concerts
769920	774320	and you therefore had a Twitter account where people were asking you Grateful Dead questions
775200	781240	then when you decided not to go to a Grateful Dead concert, you might have to announce,
781240	782400	I'm moving on.
782400	785040	I'm not going to be listening to the Grateful Dead anymore.
785040	786760	I will not be at the next concert.
786760	789720	And then someone might go, is he mad?
789720	792040	But the answer might be not really.
792040	796080	From talking to Nolan, who I guess has been around the meltdown for so long, it seems
796080	802240	like there were classes, groups of people who came to harm in town seeking out like
802240	803800	minded people.
803800	808440	And they became really close friends and they would go every week and then eventually graduated
808440	809520	from the program.
809520	814440	And then every, I feel like it was like every year he said there would be a new group of
814440	818240	people that would come in and get the first row of chairs and then they would all become
818240	819880	friends and then they would move on.
819880	823800	And if you go back through the years, you could definitely see like...
823800	827160	Well, Kevin Day just sent me some posts.
827160	833400	There was the Jane, like gif of the harm in town sticker being taken off the car.
833400	841240	And then Jane said, enough of harm in town nonsense, time to find some new nonsense.
841240	844800	Hashtag, harm and frown, hashtag moving on.
844800	845800	Harm and frown.
845800	846800	Okay.
846800	847800	Well, some negative connotations.
847800	848800	Harm and frown.
848800	849800	All right.
849800	853800	Well, Jane, if you're listening, first of all, busted.
853800	860120	And second of all, as we're learning from so many of our sisters, you got to step forward,
860120	863880	speak up and say what happened to you so that it can be addressed.
863880	870520	We can't, if something bad happened and you want us to talk about it, then the first step
870520	873440	is you can't communicate with animated gifs.
873440	876960	The fact that she was texting me friendly like today makes me think that there's no
876960	881360	harm done or like no sever apples.
881360	885160	But also, leaving harm in town isn't a bad thing.
885160	888440	Like there's no reason why you should always listen to the show.
888440	891680	I think saying harm and frown is a bad thing.
891680	892680	Harm and frown.
892680	893680	Yeah.
893680	898880	You got to turn that harm and frown upside down because pee is yellow and poop is brown.
898880	899880	Yeah.
899880	904320	On the off chance that the offense was lack of attention, we are now participating in
904320	905560	an unhealthy syndrome.
905560	907280	So let's move on.
907280	908960	All right.
908960	910360	What else is going on?
910360	911480	How's Spencer's new car?
911480	916560	I wish he was here to talk about it, but I'm curious to hear your thoughts about it.
916560	921320	Spencer got a Honda CRV and it's, yeah, I don't know, I don't really have anything
921320	922320	to say about it.
922320	923320	I mean, Spencer was here.
923320	924320	It'd be funny to talk about it.
924320	926320	Didn't he already have one or he'd afford something rather, right?
926320	928120	He had a, what was that thing?
928120	930120	It was as iconic as the mystery machine.
930120	931120	It was just so expensive.
931120	932120	It's like a Ford Expedition.
932120	934160	I don't even know this, I don't know.
934160	939360	It was purple and it was, you know, it was infused with pot.
940360	943840	When you get your, because you've been talking to Dan, because sometimes you talk about how
943840	948200	rich you are and then lately you've been saying that you're broke or that you're pretty broke,
948200	951360	but then you're going to get this Rick and Morty fortune that's coming.
951360	952360	I'll be rich.
952360	953960	I will soon be rich.
953960	957680	I might even, like I'll make a pitch and I might even help you out on this one because
957680	959360	I want this to be a thing.
959360	961800	Can we get Spencer like a mystery machine?
961800	967680	Like, can we get him an airbrushed like Ford O'Connor line van with bubble windows and
967680	969080	Vikings and dragons airbrushes?
970080	974560	Why is there, why are you campaigning to get the guy who just got a brand new car?
974560	978120	I'm saying we could step up his, we could step up that Spencer game a little bit.
978120	979520	What about stepping up my game?
979520	984880	He just, Levi just got an Audi, then now Spencer's got a CRV, Spencer drives me to work every
984880	985880	day.
985880	986880	I have no car.
986880	987880	I got a bicycle.
987880	988880	But you don't want a car.
988880	990000	I don't, I don't need one.
990000	991000	I do want one.
991000	992000	You don't, you do.
992000	995680	I need my next car to be a Tesla, which I cannot afford.
995680	996680	So I'm waiting.
996680	999560	Wait, didn't you meet Elon Musk or what's his name?
999560	1003280	Yeah, but I wanted to be different and not ask him for a Tesla.
1003280	1004640	Okay, here's my new pitch.
1004640	1012480	Since your, since your buddies with the scientific famous people have him make you a, a hybrid
1012480	1015720	van or an electronic, like E van.
1015720	1024720	I mean, somebody suggested that I ask Elon, my friend, first name basis, to make me a
1024720	1027520	dedicated hyperloop from my home to work.
1027520	1028520	That makes sense.
1028520	1029920	What's a hyperloop?
1029920	1035120	It's a, it's a, it's a, it's an imaginary L train for rich people.
1035120	1036600	That you just go zip, zip.
1036600	1038120	It's super fast.
1038120	1039120	Just from like.
1039120	1040120	It's one of his many dreams.
1040120	1041120	Right.
1041120	1045000	Because I always said like, the only reason people want to live up in the Hills and the
1045000	1048440	Hollywood Hills, you know, but like, what if you forgot your wallet, you got to drive
1048440	1049680	all the way back up there.
1049680	1050920	It's a nightmare.
1050920	1055120	But if you did live up there and you were like Drew Carey money or, you know, Sam Simon
1055120	1061520	money, you're up living at the top of Mulholland drive, you get a zip line to the three places
1061520	1062520	that you like to go.
1062520	1063520	You get one.
1063520	1064520	Didn't we talk about this once?
1064520	1065520	Like it was a.
1065520	1066520	Or ski lifts.
1066520	1071600	No, you, you fucking have a system of ski lifts where you just get in a chair and go
1071600	1072920	to wherever your job is.
1072920	1075840	Go back to like out to your house.
1075840	1080560	Little Dom's drawing room, you have a, you have a, like a four ski lift system.
1080680	1085800	Well, you get, you get, you get a number of zip lines that are proportional to your financial
1085800	1089360	bandwidth, the contribution to society, whatever metric you want to promote.
1089360	1091360	And then, and so I'm a five zip liner.
1091360	1092360	So I get five.
1092360	1098080	It's like having a fast travel if I, if I, if I just had a slow ski lift from the drawing
1098080	1101600	room to back to my place, that would be worth its weight in gold.
1101600	1104040	Well, kind of what you're talking about, huh?
1104040	1105760	Because you just be drinking all the time.
1105760	1106760	I do it anyway.
1106760	1107760	I'm still here.
1108360	1111360	But I might die in a lift going back and forth.
1111400	1113000	Also, there's like liquor in our houses.
1113000	1113760	We're grown men.
1113760	1116280	Yeah, like we're not intervention.
1116280	1118800	I almost never have actual liquor in my place once in a while.
1118800	1121200	Like if it's a gift, I let you go out to drink.
1121800	1123000	Well, yeah, I don't drink.
1123000	1124960	I don't drink at home unless I'm with someone else.
1124960	1126800	Right. We, we talked about the zip lines.
1126800	1131200	It was years ago as our UCB show in New York when we were doing the great minds pilot.
1131200	1137480	Oh, and you guys were on abs of and Spencer was back when Jane was our friend.
1138360	1141680	Yeah, yeah, the zip.
1141680	1142440	Yeah. Yeah.
1142440	1143920	I know we talked about the zip line thing.
1143920	1145560	Was it? It was it was a podcast episode.
1145560	1149360	Yeah, but I'm upgrading zip line to ski lift because I don't want to have to do
1149360	1150680	like hold on to shit.
1150680	1154320	I want to just get why don't you just be like the old lady in Gremlins and take a
1154320	1158200	take a fancy stare chairlift.
1159160	1162640	The stairs will just make Los Angeles like the Winchester mansion.
1162640	1165240	And this is where those stairs go.
1165240	1166080	They don't really go anywhere.
1166080	1172720	That's just when Jeff needs to get to Glendale, but it's but I just got a bike,
1172720	1174720	which is kind of like a kind of like a healthy version.
1174720	1175800	You looked really good on that.
1175800	1180240	I'll tell you what, man, from where we live, if you take a if you get on the bike
1180240	1184080	and go down to Sunset Junction, which is what we did, and I had a then you're fucked.
1184080	1184760	You got to go uphill.
1184760	1187760	I know. But I'm saying like the zip zip line, you'd be fucked, too.
1187760	1190280	That's why ski lift, but one ski lift, one direction.
1190280	1193760	Yeah, it was a great band, wonderful experience.
1193760	1195440	I was like, I can't believe.
1195440	1196480	What if you had one direction?
1196480	1198880	The band actually just carry you like on a litter.
1198880	1204400	You just it's like shrob now, just connecting dots.
1204400	1209760	If you really had money and you could afford at some point, everyone has their price.
1209760	1213160	You could get one direction to carry you like on their shoulders to places.
1213160	1215840	If you really, really had the dough.
1215840	1217080	I don't know why you would do that.
1217080	1218160	I worked with them once.
1218160	1219960	Yeah, on iCarly.
1219960	1220960	All right.
1220960	1222760	Yeah, they only showed up for a shoot day.
1222760	1228240	So I was a stand in for, I believe it was Zane, and I had to learn their song.
1228240	1231640	And it was before they got big, like in the United States.
1231640	1236120	And so like during run throughs, I'd have to sing that song in front of all the Nick execs.
1236120	1237400	Can you give us a little piece of that?
1237400	1240600	I don't even remember.
1240600	1241920	Give me a little bit.
1241920	1244320	Church, what has that song go that that's what makes you beautiful?
1244320	1246800	It's like the what's the hook?
1246800	1247640	No. All right.
1247640	1251520	It was like, that's what makes you beautiful.
1251520	1254720	I don't remember the, I don't remember the words.
1254720	1255720	I honestly don't.
1255720	1256720	I try to forget.
1256720	1260320	I don't even know what anyone's talking about, because I'm just thinking about Elon Musk.
1260320	1266280	He's beautiful, tall, worked out, masculine, intelligent frame.
1266280	1267280	What was the good in those pictures?
1267280	1269800	What was the circumstance that you guys met each other?
1269800	1273280	I leave town for four days and you're hanging out with Elon Musk.
1273280	1280520	You know, he's got kids, and those kids are at that Rick and Morty age.
1281520	1283520	I don't know if his kid's, I don't know.
1283520	1284520	Griffin?
1284520	1285520	You don't name your kid Griffin.
1285520	1286520	It's a fucking horrible monster.
1286520	1288520	You're not fucked with my friends, children.
1288520	1291520	Wait, the Griffin isn't that horrifying.
1291520	1293520	Griffin is kind of a crap-chessed beast.
1293520	1298520	I don't know what the rule is with billionaires if their kid's names aren't public or something.
1298520	1299520	I'm kidding.
1299520	1300520	Pretend I'm kidding.
1300520	1304520	Strike his name from, I don't know, did I dox one of his kids or something?
1304520	1306520	Is that actually his name or did you just like throw a name at him?
1306520	1307520	No, it's not.
1307520	1308520	Oh.
1309520	1311520	His daughter, Kymera, his son, Gorgon.
1311520	1313520	I don't know what the rules are with people's kids.
1313520	1317520	You know, like Adam Savage had a, I was hanging out with him and his kid at Comic Con.
1317520	1318520	I took a picture of him.
1318520	1323520	I tweeted it, and then a lot of Adam Savage fans that know him better were like,
1323520	1326520	he doesn't, his kid is not, his kid is off limits.
1326520	1328520	He doesn't want people tweeting pictures.
1328520	1330520	His kid is actually a myth.
1330520	1336520	So I put the, so I took the picture down and Adam texted me and said,
1336520	1337520	yeah, but he just turned 18.
1337520	1338520	He's his own man now.
1338520	1343520	He'd love, he'd love for you to, so my point is everybody's got their own rules,
1343520	1345520	you know, like which, and who are we to?
1345520	1349520	So then I caught myself, I'm like, I don't know if my friend Elon Musk,
1349520	1353520	my new best friend, I can only speak for myself.
1353520	1354520	Why did you meet him?
1354520	1355520	He's my new best friend.
1355520	1356520	I can't like name his kids.
1356520	1357520	How did you guys, because of Rick and Morty?
1357520	1359520	So okay, here's a story.
1359520	1363520	McMahon, he tweeted at the Rick and Morty account, I believe,
1363520	1365520	responding to something McMahon had written.
1365520	1369520	And then they had like a fun conversation about simulations back and forth.
1369520	1370520	Oh, right.
1370520	1375520	And then his assistant reached out to us to set up.
1375520	1377520	So now we're in contact with his assistant and I think, you know,
1377520	1379520	I didn't want to push, I didn't want to smother.
1379520	1383520	I was thinking like, be a, be a delicate, cool dude.
1383520	1386520	Sit down, have some chicken with him.
1386520	1389520	Talk to him about a couple of things.
1389520	1391520	Justin did the voice for the kids.
1392520	1396520	Did you meet his new toddler daughter, Medusa?
1396520	1397520	Come on.
1397520	1399520	I'm not going to let you threaten my new friendship.
1399520	1401520	You two are going to get along.
1401520	1402520	I'm jealous.
1402520	1405520	I met Adam Savage through you and I was very excited.
1405520	1411520	And he was walking around Comic Con in New York with a Neanderthal femur,
1411520	1412520	which is hard to say.
1412520	1414520	He had a femur with him.
1414520	1415520	Just a leg.
1415520	1416520	And he was saying it was going to be part of his costume.
1416520	1418520	But he wasn't wearing the costume.
1418520	1420520	He was just carrying it around like a beat stick.
1420520	1424520	And the game is for these like incredible costumes that are so extreme that you can't tell it's Adam Savage.
1424520	1425520	Sorry, he really makes me curious.
1425520	1427520	Doesn't our friend Ryan Nagata make some of that shit for him?
1427520	1428520	Like the space outfits and stuff?
1428520	1429520	I didn't know that, but I'm not.
1429520	1430520	I think he does.
1430520	1433520	He made like a full on NASA space outfit.
1433520	1435520	I think they call him space outfits.
1435520	1438520	But I'm going to give it, I'm going to give it a couple of weeks.
1438520	1439520	Let it cool.
1439520	1445520	You know, not to play these like red pill dating rules, but, you know, not seem desperate.
1445520	1448520	Then we reach out to the assistant.
1449520	1451520	Would Alon like to come on Harman Town?
1451520	1452520	Just have a chat.
1452520	1453520	Oh, OK.
1453520	1454520	He seems like I don't know.
1454520	1456520	I don't know how available he is.
1456520	1461520	And the answer if the answer is, oh, no, he does podcasts all the time.
1461520	1462520	Then I'm like, all right, fine.
1462520	1465520	Well, will he do ours, too?
1465520	1467520	But if the answer is doing he never does.
1467520	1468520	I mean, never does.
1468520	1470520	And then then then I'm like, OK, cool.
1470520	1472520	But maybe maybe he'll do ours.
1472520	1477520	Because then I then I've beaten merit and, you know, I've beaten merit because because
1477520	1478520	presidents are just schmucks.
1478520	1483520	They just have like four year parasites, like billionaire philanthropist effect.
1483520	1485520	This guy's a historical figure.
1485520	1487520	It's like having Howard Hughes on your show.
1487520	1488520	It's like Einstein.
1488520	1490520	It's like having Howard Hughes on your show.
1490520	1493520	And it's like having Howard Hughes on Howard Hughes's show.
1493520	1497520	Dan is pointing at himself with two thumbs right now.
1497520	1500520	In case you didn't want to spend five dollars on this.
1500520	1505520	What am I, if not the Elon Musk of stupid people, you know, like I like it's like it
1505520	1508520	would be a historical event for him to come on the show and have a chat.
1508520	1512520	And from the brief little, you know, conversations I had with him, I just think it would be a
1512520	1516520	really fun conversation because a couple of things that I'm really stoked about.
1516520	1520520	My new friend, he likes all the same video games I do.
1520520	1524520	He's like so into like the Bethesda stuff that fall out and stuff.
1524520	1529520	Even just talking to him about Fallout 4, maybe we want to go play Fallout 4 again.
1530520	1536520	And also I really, without oversharing, because I want him to know when it gets back to him,
1536520	1543520	you know, being friends with Dan Harmon isn't going to put you at risk of any over, what do you call it,
1543520	1548520	leaking oversharing, over, you know, he's not going to Chevy Chase you.
1548520	1549520	Don't worry.
1549520	1551520	He's a very private guy.
1551520	1554520	You can have a very discreet friendship with your new friend Dan Harmon.
1554520	1556520	How does he know that you're not going to Chevy Chase him?
1556520	1557520	That's what I'm saying.
1557520	1563520	I was using the verb Chevy Chase to mean what I did to Chevy, which is like air, like play his voicemail.
1563520	1564520	I got you.
1564520	1572520	Elon can leave me a voicemail saying like, oh, so I don't really like having trouble with this mountain,
1572520	1575520	mountain digging machine.
1575520	1578520	I just need your help and I know you play a lot of Minecraft.
1578520	1583520	And I'll like call, I'm not going to tell the audience, oh, guess what's going on?
1583520	1585520	Like, because that'll ruin it, you know?
1585520	1588520	But so what was my point?
1588520	1599520	Oh, without oversharing, I just want to say about my new best friend, Elon Musk, that I really liked.
1599520	1605520	One thing about him in particular, from an emotional, spiritual perspective, is like during the conversation,
1605520	1613520	we briefly touched on an area of where he was like, he was explaining, there was a guy basically he didn't like.
1614520	1619520	There was a guy whose point of view he thought was, as he called it, very dangerous.
1619520	1621520	And we were talking about the AI thing.
1621520	1622520	And then he was talking about the guy.
1622520	1634520	And I really liked the fact that he was simultaneously totally adamant about how this guy is thinking is so dangerous.
1634520	1637520	But also, he never called the guy an idiot.
1637520	1640520	He didn't dismiss him because the guy is dangerous.
1640520	1650520	You know, it's like that cool kind of like he was like a general like observing like, you know, this guy has got a lot of popular thoughts about this, the direction of this technology.
1650520	1654520	And that guy is like, he's a dangerous thinker.
1654520	1660520	And when he when he kind of enumerated the things that were dangerous about this person, it was all rooted in honesty.
1660520	1663520	He was like, he was like, this guy's good at this, this, this and that.
1663520	1667520	And all of those things that have in common, they're all they're all about deception.
1667520	1668520	They're all about manipulation.
1668520	1678520	Like, and I really, you know, that's that's why we're going to be like fucking capital B, capital F, capital F.
1678520	1688520	It's because we were like, you know, and but like, it'll be like you, me and, you know, big, big fat fuckers.
1688520	1689520	You're gonna get jealous.
1689520	1690520	I'm sure I want to meet him.
1690520	1692520	Well, you got like, don't fuck it up.
1693520	1700520	You're making you're making it sound like you're going to steal Elon Musk away from the world and you guys are going to go live on a little beach together.
1700520	1701520	No, no, no, no.
1701520	1702520	You would you want to.
1702520	1703520	I was reading this article.
1703520	1711520	He just so Teslas have the automated driving systems and apparently insurance companies hike up premiums on Teslas.
1711520	1715520	So they created their own insurance.
1715520	1717520	They've done it internationally, but are now starting to do it.
1717520	1728520	They paired up with Liberty Mutual, I think, to offer cheaper insurance because self-driving cars are, I guess, statistically safer than regular cars.
1728520	1730520	So the insurance premium shouldn't be raised.
1730520	1731520	They should be lowered.
1731520	1745520	And as our society moves closer and closer to having all self-driving cars, it's going to the insurance companies are going to take a massive hit because good drivers will be much safer.
1745520	1746520	They'll be all automated.
1746520	1753520	Is it Liberty insurance that there's always some asshole sitting having a coffee in front of the Statue of Liberty?
1753520	1754520	Yeah.
1754520	1755520	And they say some really dumb stuff.
1755520	1757520	You just bought a car and then you drove it into a tree.
1757520	1758520	But guess what?
1758520	1760520	That wasn't the smartest thing you ever did.
1760520	1761520	And now they want to.
1761520	1762520	It's like, fuck you.
1762520	1765520	Like I'm just trying to watch news.
1765520	1767520	Insurance has to be one of the like.
1767520	1768520	Yeah.
1768520	1772520	That's like the dorsal fin on the shark of the of capitalism.
1772520	1778520	Like it's like it's like now that's not a good metaphor because the dorsal fin just warns you that it's there.
1778520	1781520	It's like it's the it's the ridge on the Rhodesian Ridgeback.
1781520	1787520	It's the it's just it's it's where it's where it's it's where it hits its worst, isn't it?
1787520	1793520	Like you go from just regular capitalism, which is arguably like like, look, it's going to happen anyway.
1793520	1795520	People are going to trade favors.
1795520	1797520	They're going to trade boots for chickens.
1797520	1801520	So when we really knuckled down and said, look, let's create poker chips and we can buy.
1801520	1805520	But then you go from that to banking, which is, oh, I'll watch your money while you're gone.
1805520	1807520	And can I give your money to other people?
1807520	1808520	But only theoretically.
1808520	1810520	And then when I hold it, they hold it and then you hold it, hold it.
1810520	1814520	And then I ensure the holdings and then like, OK, it starts to get really sketchy.
1814520	1817520	Then it goes to corporations, which are like, OK, well, this isn't really a person.
1817520	1818520	This is just a company.
1818520	1819520	It's a group of people.
1819520	1821520	And it'll actually live longer than the people that started it.
1821520	1824520	And it also has an interest in politically.
1824520	1830520	But but the real height of it all, the biggest evil of all, is where it's indistinguishable
1830520	1832520	from organized crime.
1832520	1836520	When people are coming to your home and saying, it would be a pity for something to happen
1836520	1838520	to this fucking house, wouldn't it?
1838520	1839520	It would be really bad.
1839520	1841520	You love your kids, don't you?
1841520	1843520	Sure would hate to see them die.
1843520	1844520	Sure would.
1844520	1845520	But they'd hate to see you die.
1845520	1848520	Hate to see you break your kneecaps at Liberty Mutual.
1848520	1854520	Like when you get your kneecaps broken, your kids don't have to starve to death.
1854520	1859520	Just give me give me two hundred dollars a month and I'll make sure that the inevitable doesn't happen.
1859520	1860520	And it really does.
1860520	1861520	I mean, the worst.
1861520	1863520	People think I'm kidding when I tell this anecdote.
1863520	1865520	This is like this is now a decades old thing.
1865520	1869520	I definitely know I've talked about this before on the podcast, but whatever.
1869520	1875520	I got when I was living in my apartment, I remember like I was like it was part of my
1875520	1877520	I was just like I was like twenty seven.
1877520	1879520	And I was like, I'm I'm out.
1879520	1880520	I'm out of society.
1880520	1882520	I can't do this anymore.
1882520	1886520	I got I got I got an envelope from an insurance company in my mailbox.
1886520	1894520	And there was a photo of Christopher Reeves on it who wasn't dead yet, who had just sustained a horrible crippling injury.
1894520	1901520	And it was a photo of him all fucked up, not as Superman, all fucked up.
1901520	1911520	And and there was a quote underneath it that said, don't let what happened to me happen to you.
1911520	1912520	Make sure you're loved.
1912520	1914520	We make sure you're insured so that your love.
1914520	1916520	I was like, what the fucking fuck?
1916520	1919520	If this was a Polaroid, you'd be a mafioso.
1919520	1921520	Like, like, this is like what?
1921520	1923520	Don't let what what the fuck is going on?
1923520	1925520	This is extortion.
1925520	1926520	I know. Anyways.
1926520	1929520	And then you you look outside and there's a horse.
1929520	1930520	Yeah. Yeah.
1930520	1932520	Well, it's just like it's insane.
1932520	1937520	It's like it's like, oh, and so you're listening and then you're going to you're going to get on your little keyboard and you're going to go.
1937520	1943520	Oh, I got the donut crumbs on my face and the tears are mixing with it and it's making me extra briny.
1943520	1949520	So I'm going to take Dan Harmon to task with my slide rule and my because I just like arguing with things.
1949520	1952520	And if I argue with the president, he doesn't listen.
1952520	1953520	So I'm going to argue with Dan Harmon.
1953520	1955520	So you're going to type type type.
1955520	1956520	And here's what you're going to say.
1956520	1963520	So you're going to you're going to use logic to say something about how, oh, that extreme thing that I said isn't technically true.
1963520	1965520	Well, that's fantastic.
1965520	1966520	You win.
1966520	1967520	You're right.
1967520	1968520	I didn't do any research.
1968520	1970520	I didn't get a degree in this.
1970520	1972520	I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
1972520	1973520	You proved me wrong.
1973520	1975520	But I said it.
1975520	1978520	You're drinking out of a glass by somebody that doesn't even listen to our show anymore.
1978520	1979520	That's right.
1979520	1982520	I'm an I'm what they call an edgelord on Twitter.
1982520	1985520	Someone signed me up for like some.
1985520	1986520	I don't know.
1986520	1987520	They've been coming after me.
1987520	1988520	I'm getting these letters in the mail like that.
1988520	1999520	I should reserve my my plot in the ground and or my like like my ash canister or something.
1999520	2004520	Like just take care of it now so that your loved ones don't have to.
2004520	2010520	And every month I get these letters from some service in like Studio City.
2010520	2014520	There's a picture of like a twenty nine year old guy with two chicks next to him.
2014520	2020520	And it's like what Dale Dale has planned his estate early.
2020520	2021520	Like that's sexy.
2021520	2022520	Like that's like a.
2022520	2023520	Yeah.
2023520	2024520	Yeah.
2024520	2028520	Nothing turns on the ladies like like like a reserved urn.
2029520	2031520	It's never too early.
2031520	2036520	If he cares that much about his own death he's thinking about me.
2037520	2039520	He's taking the burden off of my shoulder.
2039520	2043520	I'm going to give him the best hand job of his life.
2043520	2046520	He's going to go down on me because he's thinking about the future.
2046520	2048520	And if he dies guess what.
2048520	2050520	Everyone's a winner.
2050520	2051520	Nothing.
2052520	2053520	What did she say again.
2053520	2057520	Nothing turns on the ladies like a reserved urn.
2058520	2059520	Yeah.
2059520	2060520	Yeah.
2060520	2061520	You have it out there.
2061520	2063520	Just have it like it's the first thing you see when you come into my.
2063520	2066520	I love the alliteration of reserved urn.
2066520	2073520	Because it's like it's also it sounds like like it sounds a wormy reserved urn.
2073520	2075520	You know it's like it's like it's nothing.
2075520	2077520	It's the opposite of like OK.
2077520	2080520	So hey can you hand me some of those sandbags.
2080520	2082520	I'm trying to help these flood victims here.
2082520	2083520	Just a moment.
2083520	2086520	I'm I'm reserving an urn.
2086520	2094520	This is stupid but you're talking about capitalism.
2094520	2098520	What do you think in the boots versus chickens economy.
2098520	2101520	What what what is what's worth more.
2101520	2104520	How many boots per chicken or how many chickens per boot.
2104520	2108520	Oh I would say just going from everything I know about nature I learned from Minecraft.
2108520	2112520	I would say boots would require a great deal of crafting.
2112520	2113520	Right.
2113520	2115520	And a chicken is just it's just running around.
2115520	2116520	OK.
2116520	2117520	Yeah.
2117520	2119520	You could use a chicken to make a boot but you're going to need a bunch of chicken.
2119520	2121520	Let's say I've got a nice and have some labor.
2121520	2124520	Let's say let's say let's say you've got a nice pair of boots that are my size.
2124520	2129520	And how many chickens do you want for those nice pair of boots that you spent a good deal of labor on.
2129520	2132520	Well then we get into how many chickens do you have.
2132520	2135520	It's a it's a it's a it's a seller's market.
2135520	2136520	I need these boots.
2136520	2138520	How many chickens are you going to make me give you.
2138520	2141520	But are chickens how many eggs do your chickens lay.
2141520	2142520	Huh.
2142520	2144520	Regular amount.
2144520	2145520	Are they in it.
2145520	2147520	Are they in abundance like a fucking.
2147520	2148520	I mean what.
2148520	2149520	I'm going to what.
2149520	2151520	Bend you over a barrel.
2151520	2152520	I don't know.
2152520	2153520	Welcome to ancient Greece.
2153520	2155520	They lay the most eggs.
2155520	2156520	OK.
2156520	2157520	Well good.
2157520	2158520	Then that's going to lower your chicken number.
2158520	2159520	Aren't you happy about that.
2159520	2160520	I'm doing you a favor.
2160520	2161520	Look I got to talk to my manager.
2161520	2162520	All right.
2162520	2163520	See if we can finance these.
2163520	2164520	Look I got to get these boots.
2164520	2165520	I got an appointment.
2165520	2168520	Let's say I talk to my manager and it's like it's looking really good.
2168520	2173520	Like your chicken rating is high because it's great because if your chickens lay eggs then an egg is essentially a chicken.
2173520	2174520	You know.
2174520	2177520	An egg just got laid while you were having this conversation.
2177520	2178520	That's great.
2178520	2179520	It's a great sign.
2179520	2180520	What are these boots made of.
2180520	2182520	I want to put you in a pair of boots right now.
2182520	2184520	How many chickens do you want.
2184520	2187520	Well it's just that these boots that you're looking at right here.
2187520	2188520	Right.
2188520	2189520	These are our VIP boots.
2189520	2190520	OK.
2190520	2191520	Like and.
2191520	2192520	I don't.
2192520	2193520	I want the best boots you have.
2193520	2194520	I just want to look.
2194520	2195520	I just want to put you.
2195520	2196520	I want to see you walking out of here.
2196520	2197520	I'm lousy with chickens.
2197520	2200520	I don't have a chicken shortage but here's the thing.
2200520	2206520	These are valuable to me because I can apparently trade them for all sorts of services and goods.
2206520	2207520	Yeah.
2207520	2208520	Yeah.
2208520	2210520	I want to see you in these boots but here's the thing.
2210520	2212520	You know they're going to depreciate in value.
2212520	2213520	As soon as you walk off the lot.
2213520	2214520	Right.
2214520	2216520	And they're made to your foot and.
2216520	2218520	I don't care about the resale value of these boots.
2218520	2220520	I just need boots to last me through the year.
2220520	2221520	Let me just put.
2221520	2222520	Let me just put you in a pair of boots.
2222520	2223520	OK.
2223520	2225520	That's within your bracket.
2225520	2226520	Using my chicken range.
2226520	2229520	You don't have the chicken credit to like have these other boots.
2229520	2230520	That you are looking at.
2230520	2231520	OK.
2231520	2232520	Two chickens.
2232520	2233520	These boots here.
2233520	2234520	I'll give you.
2234520	2235520	I'll give you two chickens for these boots.
2235520	2236520	Oh.
2236520	2239520	If you're going to give us two chickens I can show you the two chicken boots.
2239520	2240520	What.
2240520	2241520	I'm.
2241520	2243520	Look again I have an appointment.
2243520	2247520	How many chickens do you want for these boots because the more I look at them.
2247520	2249520	Oh I just tried one on.
2249520	2250520	These are these are lovely.
2250520	2251520	Yeah.
2251520	2252520	They should be.
2252520	2253520	Those are 17 chicken boots.
2253520	2254520	Whoa.
2254520	2255520	OK.
2255520	2256520	Well.
2256520	2257520	Yeah.
2257520	2258520	That explains the comfort.
2258520	2259520	I use it.
2259520	2262920	I take off that boot and I go it's nice almost doing business with you.
2262920	2263920	Yeah.
2263920	2264920	And I leave with my 18 chickens.
2264920	2265920	Wow.
2265920	2266920	That's not going to happen.
2266920	2267920	Wow.
2267920	2268920	That's not going to happen.
2268920	2274360	I get on my in this story do we have cell phone technology yet or.
2274360	2275360	Yes.
2275360	2276360	OK.
2276360	2277360	I get on my cell phone.
2277360	2284760	And I say Siri where can they get a nice pair of boots for eight chickens.
2284760	2285760	And Siri says.
2285760	2287760	I'm playing Phil Collins in the air tonight.
2287760	2288760	That's it.
2288760	2289760	That never works.
2289760	2290760	OK.
2290760	2291760	I come back.
2291760	2292760	Look I am in a hurry.
2292760	2293880	I'll give you 10 chickens.
2293880	2294880	I'll give you 10.
2294880	2295880	Right now.
2295880	2296880	10 chickens.
2296880	2297880	10 chickens.
2297880	2298880	For these 17 chicken boots.
2298880	2299880	Yeah.
2299880	2300880	But.
2300880	2301880	I walk out with them right now.
2301880	2302880	I'm a size 14.
2302880	2303880	These are size 14.
2303880	2308680	But the odds of someone else walking in there with size 14 feet and has 17 chickens together.
2308680	2314480	Sir I think you got the wrong idea about the chicken cave a boot cave like we're not we're
2314480	2315480	not hagglers.
2315480	2317240	What you do here is we provide a service.
2317240	2319640	We try to put people that don't have boots into boots.
2319640	2321960	And it costs a certain amount to create those boots.
2321960	2323920	And we just we're essentially like a co-op.
2323920	2324920	All right.
2324920	2325920	So.
2325920	2326920	You highballed you highballed me at 17.
2326920	2327920	I lowballed you at 10.
2327920	2329320	Let's do business here.
2329320	2330320	I disagree.
2330320	2331600	I mean you're looking at it from that perspective.
2331600	2335240	I'm just looking at it from a guy that's like if you have 10 chickens to spend I can show
2335240	2336240	you the 10 chicken boots.
2336240	2337240	There's another egg.
2337240	2338680	Another egg just came out.
2338680	2342000	These chickens are just they're egg factories.
2342000	2343000	Can I can I.
2343000	2344000	You know what eggs are?
2344000	2345000	Shoot your chickens.
2345000	2346000	Yeah.
2346000	2347000	I know.
2347760	2348760	That's why they were part of your credit rating.
2348760	2349760	Yes.
2349760	2350760	Yes.
2350760	2351760	Yes.
2351760	2352760	I want like fecund chicken.
2352760	2353760	They're they're fecund as fuck.
2353760	2357680	Fecund AF chicken.
2357680	2358680	I have.
2358680	2362840	Have you considered before we go any further like I'm going to I'm going to put you in
2362840	2367960	a pair of 10 chicken boots don't want your 10 chicken boots but I want you to.
2367960	2371200	You can't walk me back from 17 chicken boots to 10 chicken boots.
2371200	2374320	So the 10 chicken boots aren't good enough for you but that's the amount of chickens
2374320	2376120	you want to give for 17 chicken boots.
2376120	2378160	I think I think you're trying to rip me off.
2378160	2379160	That's insane.
2379160	2380680	That's a projection that you came into this cave with.
2380680	2383440	I'm saying look this is a big city.
2383440	2387840	There's there's other boot makers out here and I and some people like to do business.
2387840	2393440	It's a loose knit network of caves in a world of cell phones.
2393440	2396520	If you think the next thing I'm going to say is here how about 14 chickens you're out of
2396520	2397760	your fucking mind.
2397760	2398880	You started at 17.
2398880	2399880	I went to 10.
2399880	2400880	Now you make another off.
2400880	2404600	Have you even experienced me going up or down on any of my offers as far as you know I'm
2404600	2407080	monolithic in my chicken.
2407080	2409840	Well look I haven't haggled with you sir.
2409840	2411880	I'm not a dishonest person.
2411880	2415240	A monolithic business model is not a viable one.
2415240	2417080	You have to be able to move.
2417080	2420000	Maybe what you're interested in is tiny boots for your chickens.
2420000	2421560	They're over here in the women's section.
2421560	2423920	Oh see now you're being now.
2423920	2425360	I don't know what you got from that sir.
2425360	2426360	I'm just trying to help you.
2426360	2427360	Really?
2427360	2429320	We have a wonderful section over here for all the women.
2429320	2432040	So women wear tiny chicken boots.
2432040	2433840	No they just like to dress the chickens.
2434080	2436240	It's a more affordable hobby.
2436240	2437440	It kills the time.
2437440	2438440	Now I don't want to.
2438440	2439440	As you know women are.
2439440	2442760	I want these boots less and less now that I know your politics.
2442760	2448240	Oh sir my only politics are a bootless foot.
2448240	2449240	And that women hating.
2449240	2450240	No sir no.
2450240	2452440	It's just you've diminished with love.
2452440	2454040	How about 17 chickens.
2454040	2455600	Who the fuck is this guy?
2455600	2456600	This is Andre.
2456600	2457600	Oh Jesus Christ.
2457600	2458600	Hey I'm Andre.
2458600	2459600	Hi Andre.
2459600	2460600	Hi.
2460600	2461960	Look I'm trying to get these boots.
2461960	2462960	17 seems high.
2463080	2464800	17 seems like a lot of chickens.
2464800	2466080	Then buy the 10 chicken boots.
2466080	2467480	I don't want the 10 chicken boots.
2467480	2468480	They look like shit.
2468480	2469480	You shouldn't have even put them out.
2469480	2473160	Look I wouldn't pay 10 chickens for those 10 chicken boots.
2473160	2475320	Right you'd probably pay 4 chickens for 10 chicken boots.
2475320	2477280	I get your gist sir.
2477280	2480160	You're someone that thinks that they're entitled to more.
2480160	2481160	Do you know what.
2481160	2482160	Have you ever raised a chicken?
2482160	2483160	Do you know what it takes?
2483160	2487280	Do you know the amount of care TLC?
2487280	2489680	How husbandry goes into proper chicken raising?
2489680	2490680	No sir.
2490680	2491680	What's that?
2491680	2492680	That's another egg.
2492680	2494360	You're already down 3 chickens right now by the way.
2494360	2497040	If I walk out of here right now you just have 3 more chickens.
2497040	2499560	These are all fertilized eggs popping out of my chickens right now.
2499560	2501400	Oh I see what you're saying.
2501400	2502400	Yeah.
2502400	2504960	The longer we talk about this the less chickens you're getting.
2504960	2505960	Okay.
2505960	2509360	I'm not giving you these fertilized eggs and 17 chickens.
2509360	2510360	How about this?
2510360	2511360	What about this?
2511360	2512360	10 chickens, 3 eggs.
2512360	2515480	But you gotta raise the eggs.
2515480	2520840	You have to incubate and take care of those young baby chicks.
2520840	2523200	It's not a service you provide people that have eggs.
2523200	2524200	People don't come to you with eggs.
2524200	2526080	Sir I'm here for boots.
2526080	2529540	Well if I'm getting into the business of chicken egg owning.
2529540	2530540	How about this?
2530540	2531780	Okay look.
2531780	2533240	You give me an idea.
2533240	2537400	What if you and I go into business together?
2537400	2541040	It's kind of an anarcho-syndicalist idea.
2541040	2543960	You give me some boots occasionally.
2543960	2546320	You get all the chickens you want.
2546320	2548120	You get eggs when you need them.
2548120	2552840	Whether we corner a society that is basically boot and chicken based.
2552840	2553840	Yes.
2553840	2560120	And we stop this idea that boots and chickens are worth more or less than eggs.
2560120	2564360	No we enter the idea that power is for sale and we own it.
2564360	2566360	Well you're making it...
2566360	2567360	This seems more fun.
2567360	2569000	Wait you drew me out into it.
2569000	2570000	I thought you were...
2570000	2573000	No I'm talking about mutual benefit.
2573000	2574000	Oh.
2574000	2575000	Like you know...
2575000	2576000	Yeah yeah.
2576000	2577000	I like that too.
2577000	2578000	You don't like power?
2578000	2579000	I'm going to go down to another boot store.
2579000	2580000	Look if you have power you can use it to create communism.
2580000	2581000	Like do you want power?
2581000	2582000	I can do lots of things with power.
2582000	2583000	How late are you open?
2583000	2584000	I'm going to go check out a couple of boot shops and maybe I'll come back.
2584000	2585000	9pm.
2585000	2586000	9pm.
2586000	2587000	Andre.
2587000	2588000	You're not helping.
2588000	2589000	What else you got besides chickens?
2589000	2590000	Andre?
2590000	2591000	Yes.
2591000	2592000	What are you doing this afternoon?
2592000	2593000	I'm working.
2594000	2598000	10 chickens says you're my new assistant.
2598000	2599000	What the...
2599000	2602000	You're going to give me 10 chickens to be your assistant?
2602000	2603000	How about this?
2603000	2606000	I'm going to give you 10 chickens just to have lunch with me and hear me out.
2606000	2607000	What?
2607000	2610000	What the fuck you could have had...
2610000	2613000	That means I could buy the 10 chicken boots.
2613000	2615000	Motherfucker I'm made of chickens.
2615000	2617000	I wouldn't let you go.
2617000	2618000	You can't get rid of chicken.
2618000	2619000	You can't get rid of chicken.
2619000	2621000	You can't get rid of chicken.
2621000	2622000	Motherfucker I'm made of chickens.
2622000	2623000	I wouldn't let you go.
2623000	2624000	I'm 17 chickens.
2624000	2625000	I'm just a businessman.
2625000	2628000	You don't get this many chickens given 17 chickens.
2628000	2630000	We have every boot manufacturer you walk by.
2630000	2631000	I like Andre.
2631000	2632000	I like your style.
2632000	2633000	You got a deal.
2633000	2635000	I'll have lunch with you for 10 chickens.
2635000	2636000	Okay.
2636000	2641000	Andre, after he's done peacocking at this lunch and you come back because there's nothing
2641000	2645000	substantial about the game he's running, you don't have a job.
2645000	2650000	Well, that's okay because then I'm going to use the chickens to raise more chickens and
2650000	2652000	I'm going to buy those 17 chicken boots.
2652000	2655000	Andre, what have I always told you?
2655000	2658000	Words don't cover your feet, okay?
2658000	2659000	He's doing nothing.
2659000	2660000	He's got a pile of chickens.
2660000	2661000	We don't even know they're his.
2661000	2662000	Go, go, go to lunch.
2662000	2663000	Good luck.
2663000	2668000	I swear to God, man, when you come back, you are not working at this chicken cave.
2668000	2675000	I'm going to have a chicken empire and then I'm going to buy your entire store with my
2675000	2676000	chicken empire.
2677000	2678000	Later at lunch.
2678000	2681000	Listen, Andre, here's the thing.
2681000	2682000	Okay.
2682000	2684000	It's not about chickens.
2684000	2686000	What's it about?
2686000	2687000	What it about?
2687000	2689000	It's about trust.
2689000	2695000	There's like three cavemen playing Bach on a ... I assume ... Isn't this kind of like
2695000	2696000	a caveman style?
2696000	2697000	Kind of, but we have self-love.
2697000	2698000	You said I had self-love.
2698000	2699000	Well, because I didn't want to deny.
2699000	2700000	Okay.
2700000	2701000	All right, yeah.
2701000	2705000	But there's a quartet of cavemen violinists because it's a fancy cave.
2705000	2706000	It's a fancy cave.
2706000	2707000	It's a fancy cave.
2707000	2708000	You took them to lunch.
2708000	2709000	It's like sparrows.
2709000	2710000	Okay, yeah.
2710000	2711000	Spardos?
2711000	2712000	Sparkies?
2712000	2713000	Sparrows?
2713000	2714000	Sparrows?
2714000	2715000	No, that's not sparrows.
2715000	2716000	Sardis.
2716000	2717000	Sardis.
2717000	2719000	We're at Sardis.
2719000	2722000	I've flown you to New York and we're off-Broadway.
2722000	2723000	At sparrows.
2723000	2727000	Yeah, we just saw Hello Dolly with Bette Midler and we're across the street and it's four
2727000	2730000	cavemen playing.
2730000	2733000	Listen, Andre.
2733000	2734000	Yes.
2735000	2737000	I'm not going to be alive much longer.
2737000	2738000	Oh, geez.
2738000	2739000	Yes.
2739000	2745000	I have a rare disease that the doctors don't think I really have much longer to live.
2745000	2752000	But I have to leave these chickens to somebody and I just have the sneaking feeling.
2752000	2756000	Your business acumen ... Hey, guys.
2756000	2761000	I give each cavemen a chicken a fuck off.
2761000	2763000	Oh, God.
2763000	2765000	She just ate the chickens raw.
2765000	2767000	More garlic stuff like olives?
2767000	2771000	I mean, Andre, I'm up to here with chickens.
2771000	2776000	I've got all the chickens, but you can't take them with you.
2776000	2777000	I can't.
2777000	2780000	No, I'm saying I can't take my chickens with me.
2780000	2781000	I've got to leave a legacy.
2781000	2782000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2782000	2783000	I've got to leave a legacy is what I'm saying.
2783000	2784000	I get it.
2784000	2786000	Well, what disease do you have?
2786000	2789000	I have Crohn's.
2789000	2790000	Oh, dude.
2791000	2792000	It's not funny.
2792000	2794000	I wouldn't laugh because Crohn's is funny.
2794000	2795000	There's people listening that have Crohn's.
2795000	2796000	That's not why I was laughing.
2796000	2797000	It's terrible.
2797000	2798000	It's a laughing tone of his voice.
2798000	2800000	He decided he had Crohn's.
2800000	2803000	I think your boss is the kind of person that finds my Crohn's disease hilarious.
2803000	2804000	Not true.
2804000	2806000	And he's a bad person.
2806000	2807000	Crohn's is really rough.
2807000	2808000	My best friend is Crohn's.
2808000	2809000	Yeah.
2809000	2810000	He's always in pain.
2810000	2811000	It ain't no fun.
2811000	2813000	They cut feet out of his intestines.
2813000	2815000	Hi, how are you guys?
2815000	2816000	Hello, Amber.
2816000	2817000	Hi.
2817000	2818000	Welcome to Sardis.
2818000	2819000	Sardis.
2820000	2822000	Would you like to hear some of our specials?
2822000	2823000	Sure.
2823000	2824000	Okay.
2824000	2829000	We have a funjili pasta with extra mushrooms that's grilled over an octopus salad braised
2829000	2830000	in a simmering version A.
2830000	2831000	We'll take two of those.
2831000	2832000	We'll take two of those.
2832000	2833000	Okay.
2833000	2834000	There's more.
2834000	2835000	There's also a-
2835000	2836000	The funjili sounds fantastic.
2836000	2837000	Okay.
2837000	2838000	All right.
2838000	2839000	Two of those then.
2839000	2840000	Thank you.
2840000	2841000	Can I hook you up with any drinks, or are you guys good with your coffees?
2841000	2843000	Do you have pizza?
2843000	2845000	We have a flatbread.
2845000	2846000	Is that pizza?
2846000	2847000	It's a portobello flatbread.
2847000	2854880	It's done with artisan flatbread out of flatbread, served with flat pieces of bread and portobello.
2854880	2857360	Put olives on it.
2857360	2863120	We have a suko, which is a Japanese olive substitute.
2863120	2864120	It's basically the same.
2864120	2865520	We'll take two of those.
2865520	2866520	Okay.
2866520	2870200	Do you want that on the side, or do you want that as a top of nod on your Angelica?
2870200	2871200	Yes, the latter.
2871200	2872200	Okay.
2872200	2873200	All right.
2873200	2874200	Thank you.
2874200	2875200	I'll be right back.
2875200	2876200	Thank you, Amber.
2876200	2877200	I pick up my pen.
2877200	2879200	Just getting it off the floor.
2879200	2886000	I pick up the pen, and I notice it has the same- It says, boot cave on it.
2886000	2889000	You're a fucking spy, aren't you, Amber?
2889000	2890000	Boot grappling.
2890000	2891000	Shoelace grapple.
2891000	2892000	Do this.
2892000	2893000	Cave skylight.
2893000	2894000	Chickens unite.
2894000	2904680	Out from the valise I brought with me, 17 chickens get out and form a giant chicken
2904680	2909280	Voltron and attack Amber, the waitress.
2909280	2910280	Wow.
2910280	2915280	We fight, and I die, but nobly.
2915280	2922000	But also, a lot of the chickens die, and then I wonder, you know what, at what price, boots?
2922000	2923600	You could, yeah.
2923600	2929640	Back at the boot cave, I'm just looking at a photo of my daughter who left me with her
2929640	2933480	mother because I was too focused on my boots.
2933480	2940320	And I'm hearing their voices say, if you ever get your head on straight, I'll be waiting
2940320	2943120	for you.
2943120	2948280	Did she become a waitress at Sardis, or is this a different person?
2948280	2949280	Yes.
2949280	2951280	You can say no.
2951280	2952280	You can say no.
2952280	2953280	Well, then no.
2953280	2954280	Say yes or no question.
2954280	2956720	Well, then I go, yeah, no.
2956720	2963640	And also, I crumbled the photo, and I burst into flames because my boots, the special
2963640	2970320	expensive flint boots that I made that are the sort of crowning achievement of my boot-obsessed
2970320	2976160	workaholic lifestyle that cost me my wife and daughter, well, I'm fidgeting because
2976160	2980080	I'm thinking about packing and going to finally abandon the boot business and be with my wife
2980080	2981080	and kids.
2981080	2986000	And the flint that my boots are made out of sparks sets all the boot materials on fire.
2986000	2991000	The whole place bursts into flames because there was no fire permit, because Andre is
2991000	2993840	working on that.
2993840	2994840	And I just die.
2994840	2998560	It just pulls back from my cave, and I'm just dying, and I'm dying.
2998560	3000520	And then right as you die.
3000520	3001840	I made the right decision.
3001840	3002840	You did.
3002840	3009200	And then right as you die, Andre comes back and sees the building on fire, and he's wearing
3009200	3014200	boots made of chickens, like the nicest chicken boots of all time.
3014200	3017120	And he's the master of both worlds.
3017120	3023840	Well, our guest tonight on Harman Town has been waiting for a really long time.
3023840	3025440	I just remembered we have a guest.
3025440	3026440	Oh, shit.
3026440	3027440	I forgot.
3027440	3028440	Oh, yeah.
3028440	3029440	Let's bring him in.
3029440	3030440	Yeah.
3030440	3035400	Let's bring in ... If big fans of the podcast will remember this guy for sure, because he
3035400	3040000	directed the documentary that I produced about myself.
3040000	3042800	I always have to say it in that voice.
3042800	3043800	But it was his movie.
3043800	3044920	He directed it.
3044920	3045920	It's Neil Berkley.
3045920	3046920	Yeah.
3046920	3048920	Can I move this a little bit?
3048920	3049920	Yeah.
3049920	3050920	Move it however you want.
3050920	3051920	Oh, wow.
3051920	3055080	Good to be here.
3055080	3059560	I'm starting to feel like I should have worn a gray t-shirt to this affair.
3059560	3064440	I want to point out at the top, because I'm getting self-conscious, the reason Neil's
3064440	3067280	a guest isn't because he made a documentary about me.
3067280	3072320	It's because that's how I know him, and that's how I know he made a documentary recently
3072320	3076720	about Gilbert Gottfried, who also fans of the podcast will know.
3076720	3081080	But fans of comedy will definitely know.
3081080	3085720	You just did basically ... I mean, did you do the same thing with Gilbert that you did
3085720	3086720	with me?
3086720	3087720	Yeah.
3087720	3089120	I just started showing up at his house every day.
3089120	3091120	I moved to New York and just started living there.
3091120	3094160	I'd go to his house every day at nine o'clock while I used to have his coffee, and I'd
3094160	3095920	warm him down, finally get him to open up.
3095920	3099040	But yeah, I just became part of his life and followed him around.
3099040	3102280	I went to 15 different cities in Mexico and Toronto.
3102280	3104680	How comfortable was he with you becoming part of his life?
3104680	3105680	He hated it.
3105680	3108080	For the first two months, he hated it.
3108080	3110080	He was one of those guys that he doesn't really say no to anything.
3110080	3113960	If you put something in front of him, he just does it, whatever it is.
3113960	3118000	His wife said, come over and try this, and I would do it every day.
3118000	3119320	He never even dropped the character.
3119320	3120480	He was in the voice.
3120480	3122120	You met him when he's not in character.
3122120	3125240	I would go over there, and he would talk like that, and his eyes would squint.
3125240	3126240	Really?
3126240	3127240	Yeah, he would do it.
3127240	3129600	Then finally, I was just going over every day, and he stopped doing it.
3129600	3130600	Oh, really?
3130600	3131600	That's really interesting.
3132600	3133600	You've met him.
3133600	3135600	It'd be very awkward to be around.
3135600	3136600	Yeah.
3136600	3141600	That sounds a little more critical than I would say it, but you're a director.
3141600	3142600	You're not an empath.
3142600	3153600	I find it fascinating, because I grew up on Gilbert Gottfried.
3153600	3159600	He does that character, but it's not quite like...
3159600	3164680	It's like we're friends with Bob Goldthwaite, who would get on stage in the same era of
3164680	3168680	comedy where it was like, stand-up was so popular, you had to have a fucking accordion
3168680	3174360	or a hammer for a head, and there were some really funny stand-ups who...
3174360	3177360	It was like, look, you've got to have this character to get...
3177360	3178360	Then there's these guys.
3178360	3181800	It's like, so Emo Phillips, is he doing a character?
3181800	3188600	I've never had a conversation with him where he didn't sound the way he sounds on stage.
3188600	3194080	Goldthwaite, there's an easy, definitive line, but you only know it from talking to
3194080	3195080	Bob.
3195080	3200280	Bob owns that line and says, when I was doing that performance, I did that act.
3200280	3201440	That's not me.
3201440	3205240	I am now me.
3205240	3209800	You rely on him, because otherwise you would listen to Bob, and you would go, oh, you just
3209800	3213360	made that sound that screechy Bobcat Goldthwaite makes.
3213360	3219840	Like he does still, because how much of it is, well, this is how I talk.
3219840	3228560	Sometimes when I get on stage and I have to say something difficult, I'll cover my eyes,
3228560	3232640	or I'll just engage in these really arched behaviors that I know that if I step on the
3232640	3236840	gas there and it's like, okay, well, then you can get through the nervousness.
3236840	3243320	You're not shocked to learn that I brought you on and then did all the talking, but this
3243320	3247260	is what I imagined we would get to this eventually, but now we're right into it.
3247260	3252800	My question off of what Dan's saying is, when he dropped the Gilbert character, what was
3252800	3254260	he like?
3254260	3258920	What was the difference between the on character and off character?
3258920	3260880	He wasn't performing.
3260880	3263520	For a long time, he would do canned lines.
3263520	3265680	It was like being on a talk show with him.
3265680	3268080	People go on talk shows and they've got these canned lines and they know we're going to
3268080	3269400	get reactions.
3269400	3272760	It was a lot of that, but eventually he started talking to me about his mom.
3272760	3277080	He was very close to his mom, lived with her until he was almost 40, devastated when
3277080	3278080	she passed away.
3278080	3279720	His sister is a photographer.
3279720	3283760	She actually shot the whole process of her mother's very sad death.
3283760	3286680	I talked to Gilbert about that and talked to his sister about that.
3286680	3287680	Talked about his father.
3287680	3289120	His father died when he was 19.
3289120	3292920	He had a horrible relationship with his father.
3292920	3297120	First of all, let's start with the dad.
3297120	3298120	Why was it horrible?
3298120	3301680	Horrible in that he was one of those dads that was like, become an electrician, get
3301680	3302680	a job.
3302680	3305600	He went to school when he was 15 and started doing comedy immediately.
3305600	3309040	He would leave every night to do comedy all night and his dad just didn't get it.
3309040	3310360	There were arguments and fights.
3310360	3316640	Then when his dad died, Gilbert's just a lot of pain about his dad not seeing his success,
3316640	3317640	which every comic I talked to-
3317640	3320160	That would fucking kill me.
3320160	3322320	I don't know what will happen.
3322320	3328080	Erin, my ex-wife, star of our documentary, she would always say to me, and I know she's
3328080	3332640	right, whenever I would say anything about my family, like my parents didn't come to
3332640	3333640	my wedding.
3333640	3334640	I still don't know why.
3334640	3335640	I won't ask them.
3335640	3338880	Then Erin's like, why won't you ask them why they're not coming to your wedding?
3338880	3339880	Because that's what they want.
3339880	3341480	She's like, you're fucked up.
3341480	3342600	They're fucked up.
3342600	3346640	When your dad ... Because she lost her mom when she was 17 and she's like, and when your
3346640	3350760	parents die, you're going to be super fucked up about it and you're going to make everyone
3350760	3353120	else's problem and you need to deal with it.
3353120	3359000	I'm making her sound ... I think I'm making her sound like a hero, but if that's to you
3359000	3362000	making her sound like a bad person, believe me, she's not.
3362000	3367200	She was telling it like it is as a person who had a parent pass.
3367200	3375240	Sorry to derail you, but I'm imagining that, because what I do have with my dad was a moment
3375240	3383240	where my dad said that he was proud of me and that he observed ... It was way back on
3383240	3386880	the channel 101 days, we got a VH1 pilot and that was enough.
3386880	3392800	My dad said that we were having a celebration party because we got our show on VH1 and there
3392800	3396760	was a bunch of people in a bar celebrating because we had done channel 101, we had followed
3396760	3399800	our bliss, we had done it for free and now we had a television show.
3399800	3405680	My dad expressed to my satisfaction emotionally, is like, I arrived.
3405680	3410080	My dad was like, there's a lot of people in there that are very happy because of you and
3410080	3411720	that makes me very proud of you.
3411720	3414200	I was like, okay, cool, your hotel's down the street.
3414200	3418800	I ran and just burst into a thousand tears and then ... So I'm done.
3418800	3423320	Now, I know I'm going to be all fucked up if my dad dies, but I just wanted to interject
3423320	3432480	that because the idea of being 19, which I was also aimlessly ... By anyone that was
3432480	3434280	watching me would go like, what is your fucking plan?
3434280	3435280	What are you doing?
3435280	3436680	You're not that funny.
3436680	3440040	Why are you interested in comedy?
3440040	3443760	If my dad died at that time, I can't even imagine.
3443760	3444760	All right, now continue.
3444760	3445760	No, no.
3445760	3447360	I talked to a lot of comics about that.
3447360	3450760	Every comic I talked to, they were all like, yeah, most of us are up there performing for
3450760	3451760	our mothers.
3451760	3455600	We're trying to impress someone that we couldn't impress in the home and we're trying to do
3455600	3457280	this thing so we can go, look what I did.
3457280	3459200	Look at me on TV.
3459200	3463040	Artie Langs died before he became successful and Jay Leno's mother, they all expressed
3463040	3466520	real sadness about their parents not being able to see that.
3466520	3467760	Is this in your films?
3467760	3469280	I'm sad to say I still haven't seen it.
3469280	3470280	Yeah, it is.
3470280	3475080	Jay Leno, who has this real heartfelt sincere moment where he says to me, that's the saddest
3475080	3476080	thing.
3476080	3478640	Because Gilbert's really beloved by other comics.
3478640	3479640	Oh yeah, big time.
3479640	3484120	Yeah, there's a lot of pressure like Jeff Ross and David Tell and I think Howie Mandel
3484120	3488240	at the end of their interview said some version of don't screw this up.
3488240	3490320	We love this guy.
3490320	3495000	I asked you, I think when you had just started making it about ... There's a story that comics
3495000	3498840	tell about the greatest opener of all time about the Jonestown Massacre.
3498840	3502480	Did you ever ask him if that was like verify that story?
3502480	3504360	Yeah, the Jonestown Massacre story.
3504360	3506880	I forget the bit, but yeah, he has a famous Jonestown.
3506880	3512680	Because I remember like I think Drew Carey told it to me or other comics know about it
3512680	3516720	and it's like the most famous opener of all time and it was like one of those things where
3516720	3520400	when a horrible tragedy happens the day or two after that it's hard to go up on stage
3520400	3525680	and do comedy and audiences don't know if they're allowed to laugh at anything or as
3525680	3529160	a comic you don't know if you ought to be making people laugh.
3529160	3530760	That's a big part of the story, yeah.
3530760	3533120	Is it in the film by the way?
3533120	3534120	That joke?
3534120	3535120	Yeah.
3535120	3536120	No.
3536120	3537120	I remember it.
3537120	3538120	Can I do my bad version of it?
3538120	3539120	Sure.
3539120	3543960	I'm sure I'm fucking it up because this is something that was told to me a long time ago,
3543960	3548440	but he was I think at the film war and he's like, oh, the film war in San Francisco,
3548440	3549440	what a great place.
3549440	3553640	I grew up here, which I don't think he did and again, I'm probably making up a lot of
3553640	3554640	the details.
3554720	3557800	And he said, I saw Janice Chappell in here when I was a kid and I ended up meeting her.
3557800	3561000	I became friends with Janice Chappell and I was with her when she died.
3561000	3563200	She died in my arms.
3563200	3564600	I held her in my arms as she died.
3564600	3566680	So to be here at the film war is amazing.
3566680	3571960	I saw Ginny Hendricks here, became friends with Jimi Hendrix, was with him when he died,
3571960	3577200	held him in my arms, in my arms as he died.
3577200	3581720	Just got back from Johnstown and boy are my arms tired.
3581720	3586720	And it was like the day or two after the Joe's time.
3586720	3590360	I want to know how close am I to getting that right.
3590360	3591360	That's it.
3591360	3592360	That's the joke.
3592360	3593360	Yeah.
3593360	3594360	The one Bill Burr told me he saw him do it.
3594360	3595360	I think it was right after Jackie Onassis died.
3595360	3597280	He said, I met Jackie Onassis once.
3597280	3606040	First thing I said to her was, do you remember where you were when the when the David tells
3606040	3611480	and the and the and the whoever else you interviewed, like you mentioned a couple of names like
3611720	3616560	I love these guys and and they know Gilbert better than I do.
3616560	3620400	I had one encounter with him because of your relationship with him.
3620400	3623120	He came and did my show, whatever, put a pin in that.
3623120	3627880	But when those guys would get up from the end of their interviews and say, don't fuck
3627880	3629560	this up, we love this guy.
3629560	3630560	What are they?
3630560	3631560	What are they?
3631560	3635520	Do they go into more detail than that?
3635520	3642120	What is it about Gilbert in the eyes of of all these other craftsmen that that that makes
3642120	3644120	him a hero?
3644120	3646760	I would always ask that question like what is it about this guy and they would always
3646760	3647760	just say fearless.
3647760	3648760	Yeah.
3648760	3649760	I don't know if he's fearless.
3649760	3653520	He just doesn't have any line, doesn't have any boundaries, just says whatever he thinks
3653520	3656240	is funny and they love him for that.
3656240	3662560	But because he looks scared and he looks like like a weakling kind of, you know, he doesn't
3662560	3663720	look like a tough guy.
3663720	3669720	The fact that that body and that like that body language is so fearless, like was it
3669720	3671880	a film or a special where he just told dirty jokes?
3671880	3672880	He just said joke jokes.
3672880	3673880	Yeah.
3673880	3674880	Yeah.
3674880	3675880	Well, half his act is joke.
3675880	3676880	He hasn't changed his act in 30 years.
3676880	3680800	He tells Molly Ringwald jokes.
3680800	3686280	When I was a kid, I saw a standup special who knows Cinemax.
3686280	3690160	I don't know what network it was.
3690160	3696720	But he did the set and I didn't know at the time, I think, I believe now looking back
3696720	3699440	on it that he must have been doing Seinfeld.
3699440	3704880	But he did a set and then he would do his set for a while and then he would take these
3704880	3711040	little pauses and then, you know, finish a joke and go, and then what do you, yeah, that's
3711040	3712840	what I want shoes for.
3712840	3716640	And then the audience is laughing and they stop and then he'd just like change his dinner
3716640	3719360	and go like, why do you want to talk about that?
3720080	3721880	What are you doing shoe jokes for?
3721880	3722880	Yeah.
3722880	3724880	His Seinfeld impression is amazing.
3724880	3725880	That's actually in the movie.
3725880	3727680	There's a clip of him where he puts glasses on.
3727680	3730720	It's like kind of a Jim Gaffigan aside thing.
3730720	3731720	That's crazy.
3731720	3732720	That's nonsense.
3732720	3737480	Well, is that his Seinfeld impression or am I just merging those things in my head?
3737480	3742440	Because at the time, I kind of hope it wasn't because I thought it was genius just as a
3742440	3747840	lateral thing that it was just, it was sort of like Kevin Meany's, you know, his inner
3747840	3753440	monologue about his mom, obviously was like, like, like, I'd love it when comics are just
3753440	3754720	like, cause I do that too.
3754720	3759480	And also Dana Carvey, when I was doing the Great Minds episode with him where he was
3759480	3765080	doing JFK, like because I had mentioned like Dennis Miller's impression of him, like Dick
3765080	3770960	Carvey was like, like no matter what he did for the next six hours, like then he would
3770960	3775440	just follow it up with this like horrible criticism of himself in the voice of Dennis
3775440	3776440	Miller.
3777440	3781840	He'd just like riff a riff a take because it's a largely improvised show.
3781840	3785200	And then and then they'd say, okay, cut, well, let's let's do it again.
3785200	3788200	And then and then if you're like, Jesus, Carvey, why don't you, you know, and he would just
3788200	3790520	like lay into himself, like under his breath.
3790520	3793960	Anyways, there's something really important about that because Justin Roiland is like,
3793960	3795840	it's Rick and it's Morty.
3795840	3798360	It's like, it's it's I asked him about that character.
3798360	3803280	He wouldn't ever cop to it because it wasn't interesting in the story because I was like,
3803280	3804480	is that your mom or your dad?
3804480	3806520	Is that someone in your past talking to you like that?
3806520	3808440	And he was he would say, no, I just thought it was funny.
3808440	3809440	It's a bit what I do.
3809440	3812560	But other comics have mentioned that like Piscopo brought that up.
3812560	3816200	Piscopo was like he would do this on stage and I think it was his mom like berating him
3816200	3817520	or yelling at him.
3817520	3822560	I think I was like, it's a very where's he from Chicago or OK, born in Coney Island,
3822560	3823560	grew up in Brooklyn.
3823560	3827360	I think I also like Schwab like really does that really well, too, like Schwab's inner
3827360	3834720	monologue is like and you're not sure if it's his mom or his mom slash dad, like slash
3834720	3836480	pastor slash gym teacher.
3836480	3841160	But it's like but he'll do it in front of you like like he'll he'll talk as his inner
3841160	3842160	monologue.
3842160	3846400	Yeah, he I asked him about The Voice and all that and it's it's I wish it was a more satisfying
3846400	3847400	answer and it's in the movie.
3847400	3851040	And he says, look, I just went up on stage a billion times and eventually I woke up and
3851040	3852680	said, oh, I guess I act like that now.
3853680	3857560	What his Seinfeld thing is actually a lot of comics brought this up.
3857560	3862440	So before Seinfeld like became the Seinfeld we know, like before the Tonight Show, Gilbert,
3862440	3866960	people say that Gilbert invented the Seinfeld impression because he would go on stage before
3866960	3870960	Seinfeld and do his act, do Seinfeld's act as Seinfeld.
3870960	3874400	And they said Seinfeld would all the comics would come out to watch and he would pace
3874400	3876720	and just furious like what's what is that?
3876720	3877720	What's he doing?
3877720	3878720	Who?
3878720	3879720	Who wears sweaters?
3879720	3880720	Why do you wear sweaters?
3881440	3886280	Yeah, he told that he said that when he did it when he controlled for us when we were
3886280	3888080	we were on some tour.
3888080	3890040	I can't believe I can't believe I missed that.
3890040	3891880	Well, he was he was replacing you.
3891880	3892880	I know.
3892880	3893880	Yeah.
3893880	3899160	But but he was I mean, now having put a pin in this, I mean, that was my one encounter
3899160	3900760	with him was like, I didn't know what to expect.
3900760	3905720	I didn't know what Gilbert Gottfried would be who'd only ever seen him in performance.
3905720	3912280	And when he showed up and he was just like very like, God, I really don't want to use
3912280	3913540	the word frail.
3913540	3916400	But now that I've said I don't want to use it, like now it's in your head, but it's
3916400	3920160	like it was just he was so like he was like he was almost in hibernation.
3920160	3927560	Well, like he was just like sort of like shuffling and and it wasn't a lot of that it wasn't
3927560	3928560	being passive aggressive.
3928560	3930080	He wasn't like, why am I here?
3930080	3935080	He wasn't totally like down to do whatever was required of him.
3935400	3940680	It was just like this person that was just like he was just shuffling in with his wife
3940680	3948600	who was very like more sort of like like kind of almost translating for him and going like
3948600	3950200	what should get where should Gilbert go?
3950200	3951200	What do you want from him?
3951200	3952200	And what are you stuff?
3952200	3956640	And and and but it was just very good and it was like, so what do you want?
3956640	3961200	I can't remember what he sounded like, but I would go like, oh, you just go out there
3961200	3964960	and you just sit in a chair and I explained I was like, OK, all right, OK, yeah, yeah.
3965200	3968320	And I was and I was thinking, like, what's he going to sound like when he goes out there?
3968320	3968880	Right. Yeah.
3968880	3971800	And then he went out there and people like went crazy.
3972000	3976080	And then he kind of like stepped on the gas of like milking how people were going crazy.
3976240	3979880	And then it's just like, ladies and gentlemen, I'm in town.
3979880	3981960	And I was like, holy shit, Gilbert Godfrey there.
3982560	3984160	But that's the reaction a lot of people have.
3984160	3985960	And I remember that I guess that's what I meant by awkward.
3985960	3990040	Like when you do meet him off stage, especially if he's about to perform and has to deliver,
3990160	3993560	like I've gotten phone calls from people that I've set up for him to do stuff
3993960	3996560	and they'll call and go, hey, man, is he OK?
3996560	4000320	Is he does he not want to be here to set like he's because he's very quiet
4000320	4003520	and he would not be upset if I said this because people that watch the movie
4003520	4007280	the way he is physically with people like anyone with any sort of like spectrum,
4007280	4011320	me stuff and their family have all said there might be a little bit of that going on
4011640	4012800	because he's very quiet.
4012800	4015680	You know, because well, don't people say that about Darryl Hammond?
4015680	4020360	Like like like that, like I've never met him in person, but like that that's like
4021120	4026520	and then and then Dan Aykroyd, who has been diagnosed and said, I'm autistic.
4027600	4032160	Like it's not like people get confused, I think, with performers because
4033000	4037880	performance is like it's like it's a natural human occurrence.
4037880	4042400	So we have this delineation where we go, oh, you're performing as opposed to being real.
4042720	4047080	But what? But no, there's no such thing as a human interaction.
4047080	4051600	That's not a performance where a political animal and people who are on the spectrum,
4051880	4056480	like the reason why it's impossible to diagnose them without seven years of pointless
4056480	4061720	like tail chasing, whereas you can just look at a kid and go, boom, autistic, not autistic next.
4062160	4064520	Once you get to a certain age, you
4066560	4072840	the capacity for performance is so extreme that that person doesn't know who they are.
4073520	4075480	All they know is they don't want to get beaten up.
4075480	4077120	Like, just just leave me alone.
4077120	4079160	Like, just let me or give me whatever.
4079160	4080320	Like, what do I have to do?
4080320	4082080	Do I have to talk like this? Do I have to talk like this?
4082080	4084280	Do I have to talk like that? Do you talk like this? I talk like that.
4084280	4088360	Like, like, there's there's like a there's like like functional autism
4088360	4093560	like seems to be a big thing in like great impressionists.
4093560	4098800	And like, like it and so that that comes to mind because it's like that
4099000	4101800	there would be no delineation with him, unlike with Bobcat,
4102120	4104480	who doesn't have like a bunch of autistic traits.
4104480	4109000	Bobcat is just like, you know, I'm just this guy and I I kind of got into this scene
4109000	4111440	and then I stepped on the gas pedal doing this character.
4111520	4114840	And then and then that started to really punish my life.
4114840	4117720	So I lifted I got sick of it.
4117720	4121200	And by police academy, nine was like becoming self-sabotaging
4121200	4124280	and like pulled out and like pursued my bliss.
4124280	4127760	You know, he but then you have like again,
4127760	4130920	Emo Phillips, you know, what God freed Darryl Hammond.
4130920	4133600	I hope it's not rude to refer to these people
4133600	4136240	as if they're like some egg basket of people that I'm implying.
4136240	4141640	I met Emo like I did a show with him and, you know, like he's emo.
4141720	4145680	Like, like I I I get the feeling from my limited interaction with him.
4145680	4148200	It's like after the show is Jeff.
4148200	4151840	You know, did I do a good job? And so yeah, it's like, oh, thank you so much.
4151840	4153440	I don't know if I did was funny enough.
4153440	4156840	But he's talking it away trying to without that for a while.
4156840	4159120	I thought he did another version of his act.
4159120	4159680	It was a little more.
4159680	4161080	So here's the funny thing.
4161080	4165120	If Emo Phillips tries to do that, like that's another version of a bit
4165120	4167600	that he can do. Maria Bamford does the same thing.
4167600	4171280	Like, like, like she has this bit where she goes like, well, should I talk like that?
4171280	4176320	Like and then Maria Bamford will just like, like become her impression
4176320	4180600	of what I would what I'm going to say neuro a neurotypical person.
4180600	4184000	I don't know what Maria, you know,
4184000	4185960	claims to have or doesn't have.
4185960	4190960	But like I'm just saying, like, like she when she does an impression of
4190960	4193840	of a normal person, it's so funny.
4193840	4197760	And then like that's also like Gilbert Godfrey, like in his act,
4197760	4200960	going like pausing a little back like, no, why would you do that joke?
4200960	4206000	And then he like and it's so it's also unsettling because it's like it.
4206000	4211240	Well, I hate to hate, you know, like my fans are sick of hearing me.
4211240	4212600	The pic the peekaboo thing.
4212600	4214000	But that's like that's comedy.
4214000	4217320	It's like it's like the idea that you can't tell the difference,
4217320	4218840	the idea that there is no difference.
4218840	4224120	Like, that's that's what Neil was like after how long were you around him?
4224120	4226040	Like in close quarters, about seven months.
4226040	4227920	And what was your relationship?
4227920	4233120	Like, how did it you said how it started and then you got it broke through.
4233120	4237200	What's it like now or what what kind of steps did you go through with him?
4237200	4240320	It's fun. I think he came up with a routine to be around me.
4240320	4242360	Like he came up with a behavior around me like this.
4242480	4243800	He behaves a certain way.
4243800	4244880	We're friendly. We get along.
4244880	4247240	We can it's not like awkward like it was in the beginning.
4247240	4249560	Does he enjoy promoting the film or he loves it?
4249560	4250640	Well, he loves doing press.
4250640	4253640	He loves he loves he would love he loves doing stuff like this.
4253640	4254800	He'll he'll complain about it.
4254800	4257200	But once he's in there, he lights up and has a great time.
4258200	4259560	Yeah, he's going. Yeah, he's going.
4259560	4260520	Did he does he talk about it?
4260520	4263560	Like, does he feel more alive when he's performing then?
4263560	4265920	And I mean, we know we talk about the movie.
4265920	4268240	He's he hates he hates it.
4268240	4271840	He said the worst 30 seconds of my life for the 30 seconds before I go on stage.
4272520	4275440	He wishes the manager would come out and say, hey, there was a flood.
4275800	4276720	Here's your check. Go home.
4276720	4278760	Wait, but so well, that's but that's not quite.
4278760	4281360	That's the 30 seconds before then he gets on stage and he's OK.
4281360	4284120	Yeah, then the adrenaline hits and many and he lights up. Right.
4284160	4286680	OK, I mean, that's that's that's the thing that I like.
4286920	4289560	Some of the comics I know is that there are maniacs
4289560	4293880	before they're on stage and on stage that mania is their bliss.
4293880	4297720	Yeah. Does he ever did he talk about like, because
4298360	4302040	does he remember his time on stage as is he like blackout?
4302040	4303920	No, he not in the movie doesn't talk about it.
4303920	4306520	But he did tell me that there's times where he thinks he's more thinking
4306520	4308920	about like whether he has to do laundry that night.
4309360	4310840	It's so wrote for him.
4310840	4313760	Like he's like, you know, like like Mick Jagger can probably go on stage
4313760	4316880	and do his act and not even think about what lyrics he's screaming out.
4317480	4320000	Like he's that he's that into it like.
4321240	4322920	Well, I'm bummed I haven't seen it.
4322920	4324640	But where can we see it now?
4324640	4326080	Is it like where is it out?
4326080	4327240	It's going to be November 3rd.
4327240	4330440	It's going to be at IFC Center in New York City where we opened up.
4330520	4333560	Harman Town. And it had any like festival?
4333560	4335000	Yeah, it was it's premier tribe back.
4335000	4336600	It's going to be festivals in November 10th.
4336600	4338200	It's going to be in L.A. at the Fine Art.
4338200	4341040	Lemley Fine Art in Wilshire and the Lemley Monica in Santa Monica.
4341040	4343000	I mean, I really want to see it in the theater.
4343000	4345920	I know that we're friends and like you've offered to like send me the file
4345920	4348080	and and watch it or if you have.
4348080	4352360	I was out of town and didn't know, but like I'm such a fan of Gilbert's
4352360	4354920	that I'm really looking forward to just seeing.
4354920	4357920	Also, I like, you know, not not to blow smoke up you.
4357920	4361320	Like, I like the fact that you your weird
4362760	4368120	fetish is finding strange lifestyles and then documenting them.
4369120	4371040	Yeah, well, beauty is embarrassing.
4371040	4373840	It's so gorgeous. And, you know, yeah, you've got this trilogy now
4373840	4377360	of amazing people.
4377360	4380560	But no, I mean, I can speak from experience because as we talk about,
4380560	4381920	like, you're definitely not.
4381920	4385440	There's all these different documentary philosophies.
4385720	4389080	Errol Morris might say, no, I don't.
4389440	4390840	There's no such thing as truth.
4390840	4393960	I just want to tell a story like I'll shoot extra footage.
4393960	4398400	I don't. The the the the measly brothers or whatever the fuck they were.
4399280	4401800	Maisies. Not a documentary. Maisies.
4402160	4405840	Yeah. Right. There's I saw a documentary about documentary masters.
4405840	4408080	And I was like, I was amazed to realize, like, holy shit.
4408080	4410720	Yeah, documentary does not just mean roll the camera.
4410720	4414080	And what happens happens to you, however, they made salesman, right?
4414400	4415600	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
4415600	4417200	Like, that's the first Academy Award.
4417200	4420240	Yeah, that's kind of like a little close to what you do, I would say.
4420240	4423200	Like, yeah, you follow around lonely people.
4424400	4425840	And it's it's beautiful.
4425840	4429320	And also no, no seasoning, no lourries, no salt.
4429320	4432040	Like they they gather footage and then they piece it together.
4432040	4434840	Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's well, that's the that's the thing that's tragic.
4434840	4438160	And like you told me, we asked you say, hey, man, this Gilbert thing is a good idea.
4438160	4439520	And you're like, I don't know.
4439520	4441480	I'm not sure there's going to be much of a story there.
4441480	4442920	You were right. It was really hard.
4443480	4444760	He was like, you thought I was hard.
4444760	4446680	There's not really a story to harm in town.
4446680	4449640	Well, yeah, like, yeah, that's probably what it was, is we're coming off of like,
4449640	4453720	I would have thought a year before or before we did our time together.
4453720	4456120	I would have thought, fucking a make a documentary about me.
4456120	4457560	Obviously, that's what I thought.
4457560	4460200	But then again, and then again, I was like, there is any story
4461000	4463480	like like in terms of like story structure to it.
4463480	4467480	It's almost the story becomes more about the audience than us.
4467480	4468920	Yeah. And Spencer is.
4468920	4470760	Yeah. Spencer Spencer goes on a journey.
4470760	4476360	And the audience is like, like we, we learned something about what draws
4477560	4479320	harmonians to the show. Yeah.
4479320	4483400	And that like every time I watch the harm in town movie, it's I tear up
4484200	4488760	at the beautiful things that our guests say.
4488760	4490840	I had to watch the movie again recently for this thing I was doing.
4490840	4494040	I'm very proud of that movie. I really, I really, not to toot my horn,
4494040	4495480	but I'm really proud of the way it came together.
4495480	4498760	And I remember when you got your job back, you said, I got some news for you.
4498760	4501320	Give me a call or something. I saw you and you go, you're welcome for your third act.
4502920	4505480	Yeah. At least your credit bed.
4505480	4507240	No, no, the credit bed was putting Spencer on the show.
4507240	4511960	Yeah. But but yeah, it was McGathey who said just I mean, we're struggling so much.
4511960	4514600	You were like editing and editing and editing and like,
4514600	4516600	and then I remember it was, yeah, it was McGathey was like,
4516600	4519160	tell him to make it about Spencer. You fucking idiots.
4519160	4524600	You know, like this great photo that like the first day that I was with you shooting
4525320	4529240	and fuck who's the camera guys? Oh, Ryan.
4529240	4530120	Ryan. Yeah.
4530120	4534360	And we were at Dan's house and Dan and Aaron were kind of in a little bit of a tiff.
4535000	4539560	And there's this shot that I just picked up my camera and I have a picture of you
4540120	4546920	with your camera and Dan's like glowering at his kitchen at the dining room table.
4546920	4551480	And Aaron Aaron looking miserable. I'm like, oh, fuck that was day one of Harmon's.
4552440	4555400	But let's all get in the bus and go around the country together.
4555400	4558760	One of the first days was actually in this booth. You brought me in here when I was full of those
4558760	4562840	taxes and there were like notary machines that note those things that make the notary
4562840	4567080	the stamps. It was in the way of footage of that. And then after the tour, the day we got back,
4567080	4569720	you're standing right there and you said you're like talking to the camera and said,
4569720	4572920	yeah, someday there'll be podcasts. We started we started the tour.
4572920	4576200	Yeah, you have footage. I was taught. I forgot. I didn't even connect that. I
4576200	4580120	wasn't saying that for your benefit, but I remember you have footage and I said I was
4580120	4586200	in that doorway and and I said one of the douches like talk about edgelord.
4587800	4591000	But I remember saying in the doorway there, I was like,
4591000	4594920	yeah, Sony always thought they knew more about writing than me. Let's see if I can run a studio
4594920	4599240	better or something like that. I'm like, oh, great. Yeah, you're gonna what a douche.
4599240	4603320	But and day one, our driver, Jason, we had this awesome tour bus outside.
4603320	4608200	That's the tour bus in the movie. Jason's kind of underrepresented in that film. I think he's
4608200	4611960	kind of in it, right? Yeah, he's not really in it. He kind of he got really good at dodging
4611960	4616600	the cameras. Yeah, he was hilarious. And he was a maniac. And he was like a Hunter S. Thompson
4616600	4621000	character. That was one of the best. That was fun, man. And we were outside. Yeah,
4621000	4624360	I would love to do it. Aaron outside of Starburns right here in the parking lot
4625160	4631240	had bought 100 million t-shirts to bring on the bus. So we didn't have room for anything. Like
4631240	4634760	there was no room for camera equipment or anything. And Jason, the driver's like,
4634760	4639400	fuck this, I quit. I'm going back to Arizona. Like, like, this is a nightmare. Like that,
4639400	4643000	the beginning of that, I had made a prediction. And I think I even said it on camera to you.
4643000	4647160	It's like, there's no way we make all these shows. There's no way we get to all these shows.
4647160	4652280	It's wintertime. We're going to be on the East Coast. Sick. And somehow Jason got us to every
4652280	4657880	goddamn gig on time. Yeah, he was a genius. Did you hit snowstorms? Oh, yeah. Huh? Yeah,
4657880	4662440	going to Colorado. And in Salt Lake City, we were up to our hips. Like it was, yeah. No,
4662440	4666680	it was crazy. Like you, I mean, it would have been a better movie if we didn't make it to some
4666680	4672840	shows. There are people in, in, in, in other parts of the globe that would, yeah, like, I, but, but
4672840	4680920	short of like, well, more so than, uh, the worst turbulence I've ever been in on a plane, but
4680920	4685800	slightly less so than like maybe the couple of times where I thought I was drowning. Um, I, on
4685800	4691800	that bus, I experienced like moments where I was like, fuck, we're going to die because it wasn't
4691800	4697560	really, because it was empirically, it was like not as turbulence as the planes, but it was,
4697560	4703400	it was the fact that there was just no visual sense of what was happening. All we knew is that
4703400	4708680	we were on this like road and that the driver couldn't see, and that it was all white outside
4708680	4712680	and just like, just white. And he was supposed to have chains on his tires, but didn't do it because
4712680	4715960	it's bad for the bus, which is illegal, but he still got us through. Well, if you watch the
4715960	4720120	extended cut, it's in the extended cut of Harmon town. There's shots where he is ripping down the
4720120	4725000	highway and cars are pulled over and you can hear other, uh, truckers going, oh, this guy's going
4725000	4730360	way too fast. Here comes his bus. That's what I loved about it. He was the Elon Musk of drivers
4730360	4733640	because he would, he was listening to their chatter and they were going like, what the hell's
4733640	4740920	wrong with that guy? And he's like, uh, because I'm not a slave to the revenue system. I think
4740920	4746680	it was like day two on the road. Our first stop was Arizona, right? Uh, do we fuck Phoenix first or
4746680	4751480	something like that? Phoenix. Yeah. Um, and he had just gotten to know us and didn't like us all
4751480	4757320	that much. And, uh, we had stopped at like a Walmart or a, like, or something to get like supplies,
4757320	4763400	like to get like, you know, yeah, drinks and fruit and food and whatnot. And I came back
4763400	4767800	onto the bus and he didn't know that I was on the bus. He was walking around muttering to himself.
4767800	4772280	These fucking savages, savages, savages, but that was kind of his bit, right?
4773000	4776360	So I sat down and I go, Oh, are you Hunter S Thompson fan? Cause that's a word that Hunter
4776360	4782040	always uses. He goes, yeah. And we sat down and we talked and we became friends and gradually
4782040	4787800	he loved us. Yeah. But he pretended that he hated our guts. Also he was armed to the fucking teeth.
4787800	4794200	He had an arsenal of firepower on that thing. Oh yeah. Like a lot of truck, a lot of bus drivers
4794200	4800120	do, they have lots of weapons to, to like save the day. He, he had guns. People see that movie and
4800120	4803480	they always ask me like, was that a rough time? Was that hard? Cause they see some of the shots
4803480	4807400	where we're in the room, having some, you know, dark, intense conversations. And I always say,
4807400	4811560	no, man, that was a lot of fun to eat and drink and wake up in a new town every day.
4811560	4814760	Apparently when I left, cause I left when you guys were in Denver and somewhere else,
4815800	4822280	you left. Yeah. I had to go like to paying gigs and came back and the crew looked at me and like,
4822280	4825960	Oh boy. Like, I'm like, what? Like Aaron and Dan have been going at it. Like,
4825960	4831720	apparently you guys had had a real bang up like, like drunken row on the bus the night before.
4831720	4835320	And they were like, like, we're happy you're back to kind of keep order.
4837240	4843000	We were too similar. I mean, I've been, I'm respectfully silent about our breakup because
4843000	4849160	number one, it was mutual. It was amicable. And more importantly, number two, like when
4849160	4854440	Aaron and I, when I first started talking about how we got divorced, there was a night at meltdown
4854440	4858840	where one of the interns came up to me and handed me a note from a young lady in the audience.
4859480	4870040	And it said, when I was 10 years old, my parents divorced and I had to choose which of my parents
4870040	4879800	to live with. And, you know, I chose my father and had to listen to nothing but what a cunt my
4879800	4886040	mother was for the next 20 years of my life. And it never, it never changed. And I just want to
4886040	4894840	thank you for having a divorce and respecting your ex-wife. And it was exactly what I was
4894840	4899240	thinking in my head when I was like, I was like, okay, this is it. And let's, you know,
4899240	4904840	Aaron and I spent our courtship in our marriage, Instagramming and talking and airing dirty
4904840	4909480	laundry. And we made a documentary and warts and all. And the whole thing was about transparency.
4909800	4915320	It was, ironically, it was about transparency of a couple of individuals who were so into
4915320	4920920	transparency because we were both so meta, so performance oriented. Our entire relationship was,
4921720	4927480	it was like a boat made of water. It was like simultaneously like the best idea in the world
4927480	4933160	and the worst. It's like, you're already sinking. It's made of water. But no, it's like fucking the
4933160	4940120	best boat ever. There was, it was one and the same. She and I both were so meta and so,
4941400	4945480	it was like in part in the documentary, like the reason why that added just even more
4947320	4951720	twists and pressure was because Aaron and I would sit and watch documentaries together.
4951720	4957800	And Aaron was so savvy, so smart, was such a, you know, a mentor to me as a feminist. You know,
4957800	4967160	I'd listen to what she would have to say about female characters and or real people in media
4967160	4974920	and how they were being, you know, betrayed, supported, attacked. And, you know, she went
4974920	4980200	into that documentary going, God damn it, I am not going to be the documentary wife.
4980200	4985160	I'm not going to be the documentary mother. This is like, it's a very, very chiefly female role
4985160	4989800	about in the documentary about exceptional people. There's like a female threshold guardian
4989800	4994920	that their talking head is all about like, well, Dan thinks he's special, but the truth is he needs
4994920	5000520	to eat more vitamins or whatever. And he's just like, want to throw your shoe at the TV and go,
5000520	5006840	boo. And she was like obsessed with I'm not going to be that person. And the irony was,
5006840	5010520	you know, and then add to that my obsession with like, oh, I'm not going to be,
5011400	5014360	I'm not going to be all these other people like that I have in my head.
5014360	5021080	Did Gilbert, like with his wife or friends and family of his was with their relationships that
5022360	5025160	were like important to the Gilbert documentary?
5025160	5029880	His sister. Yeah. Yeah. Sister who passed away a few weeks ago. Oh, geez. Yeah. That's a big,
5029880	5034840	big part of the story. Not her passing away, but what her, she has cancer and
5034840	5035640	were they close?
5035640	5040440	Very. He, that's again, I did, I knew nothing about the guy, but every day that he wasn't
5040440	5045320	working, he would do this like three mile walk to the Lower East Side to visit one sister over the
5045320	5049960	West Village to visit the other and then back home, deeply, deeply devoted to his family.
5049960	5050600	That's great.
5050600	5055720	Incredibly. And when they're together with the family that does that, are they like,
5055720	5058200	because there's people who are deeply devoted to family who are like,
5059160	5062840	they're just always like yelling at each other. And then there's people who are like best friends.
5062840	5066520	Now they're like, the confrontation is not his thing. He would never, you know,
5066520	5071320	I think if you came at him, he would just cower. They talk about like seltzer and, you know,
5071320	5075320	news. They don't, it's like most classic older generations.
5075320	5084120	Which I now understand because it, that that's like, it is in this tumultuous year where my
5084120	5090200	relationships with myself and everything. It's like, I just realized, oh, that's where family
5090200	5095800	is supposed to go is this spot between yourself, your friends, society. And then there's this,
5096840	5102520	it's your family, like, and it's supposed to be conversations about whether it's almost like,
5103240	5109400	if you can just not hit each other and you just all recognize, I guess I learned that from
5109400	5115480	watching Cody and her family. Does that affect, like, I know about your relationship with your
5115480	5123560	parents, but as you get older and, you know, mature, do you, are you ever going to start
5123560	5126200	reaching out and communicating with them? Or is it just going to be something that just,
5127320	5132520	I'm always, I mean, I don't have an acrimonious relationship with my family. I just, there's just
5132520	5137720	no, I just don't have the, what, what Cody has with her family and what I observed with other
5137720	5144680	people where you have a, you have a, it's like, the default is connection. And if there is no
5144680	5152360	connection, something's wrong, which to me, that I'm looking at that as an abnormal person and
5152360	5158200	saying, that's normal. That should be normal. Is she, is she, does the family hug or I love you?
5158200	5162920	Are they, you know, we say, yeah, my family, but, and it's like weird because I'm like a
5162920	5167960	bread from the same family, but it's like, I, I wouldn't have it any other way, but let's get,
5167960	5171240	you know, it's like, and then you get to go like, yeah, it's like, that's why we like,
5171240	5175640	I think those myths about like the Adams family or like misfit, you know, like when you, when you
5175640	5180040	lock into like, oh, this family, they're kind of like, they do things differently. Like they're not
5180040	5186760	like that, that white bread family that like does things by rote, but like, but it's like, we love,
5186760	5192760	we fetishize those like outlaw families and things because they, they, they, oh, they're so different
5192760	5197560	and they're so weird and they're so, they have such a different way of expressing it, but the
5197560	5203160	default, everybody kind of agrees, every primate agrees in their fiber that like, yeah, but if you
5203160	5208680	don't have unconditional kind of like a connection. And so that involves ritual and tradition and
5208680	5213880	stuff. But I think that my family, like, I think when we were trying to engage in tradition and
5213880	5221000	ritual, we were so ulcerated about it. Like, like, like, like, like we, and that my parents actually
5221000	5225960	had a triumph while I was growing up of, of, of going, you know what, we don't have to do things
5225960	5231880	this way and that way. And for them, they had to realize that family didn't have to be this thing
5231880	5238520	about rules and stuff, because if they, and then, but then the, and that was good, but I'm babbling.
5239720	5246280	But I was going to ask, so with our thing, it was like a big threat that, well, we're getting to the
5246280	5251320	end of the tour, this movie's obviously going to span the tour. So where's the story? Where's the
5251320	5256680	story? And that's why it was a great thing in post for Aaron to say, like, make it about Spencer,
5256680	5260760	we're like, Oh, shit, you can make it Spencer, he just goes on the tour and then you're done,
5260760	5267240	you got a story. You're, you're two other documentaries, you're going to the person's
5267240	5274120	house, you can theoretically just keep going there forever, as long as you want. So I guess my
5274120	5283240	question to you is, like, is there a, is there a, is there a point where you go, I got it in that
5283240	5288280	case? Yeah, well, in this one, yeah, there was like his sister was really like, okay, I see there,
5288280	5291800	there's no like, he's not doing, he doesn't do any, he's not writing an act. He's not doing one
5291800	5295560	men's show. So there's no like thing to watch. He's not trying to get a star in the Hollywood
5295560	5299080	Walk of Fame. There was an Adam West documentary. It's like, you want to hook into some kind of
5299080	5303800	goal. Yeah, yeah. So he's not doing that. But there was a moment where his sister let me capture
5303800	5308840	something that he's very much a part of. And that kind of tied it all. And I felt like, okay,
5308840	5313800	that's, that's where we see him rise up. Because we hear about the Aflac thing and him screwing
5313800	5318520	that up and getting his job. And, and then we go through this whole talk about comedy's role in
5318520	5323320	society and too soon and all that. And then we see the result of that the way he deals with that.
5323960	5328200	But yeah, there was a moment where I was like, okay, that's where I think we can, we can tie this up.
5328200	5332360	But yeah, you could, you could still be shooting right now. Like you could shoot forever. Do you
5332440	5337160	have something else? Like, are you the kind of person that has three other people that you want
5337160	5343880	to go document or? Yeah, I'm, there's a few that I'm, yeah, yeah. I mean, if you did an interview
5343880	5350760	with Piscopo, I'm sure when he walked out, you're like, Jesus Christ, sequel. Got a million questions.
5350760	5354360	Interesting guy. I do have a, I mean, I really do have a lot of questions for him because it's like,
5354600	5363000	Dan and I talked, like I love that writer's room idea. Like that's, that fascinates me.
5363000	5366520	I'm obsessed with that, but I just don't think that all. Yeah. Like I said, it's like,
5366520	5370840	I was just telling him like, you gotta just, I mean, yeah, just, just like when can we just,
5371720	5376280	just cover a writer's room for a season of television? That would be fantastic.
5376280	5380040	When we came back, like Rick and Morty was in full swing and I met Justin and Rob was here
5380040	5384280	and Dino and I was like, Hey, Dan, maybe we should get cameras on this. Cause these people
5384280	5387880	are really interesting. There's also like, uh, I do a lot of shows like at theaters,
5387880	5392440	you know, the performing arts centers and you know, theaters around the country and Canada
5392440	5396760	and other places. And, uh, you talk to the stage managers there that have been there a long time
5396760	5401240	and all the stories they have. It's really fantastic. He's, I just always asked like,
5401240	5406200	who is just here? And they go, well, Andrew Dice Clay was here and that was a little interesting.
5406200	5411080	And they tell you the story. Is it so like, you, you get to know a little bit
5411080	5416360	about Andrew Dice Clay, but how fucked up he was before the show peed on the back wall
5417000	5421640	was disappeared for a while. No one knew where the fuck he was and then walked out and killed
5422600	5426680	like, like, like was completely blacked out and then just went out there and destroyed.
5426680	5432040	Then after the show dead, you know, just like, like, like inoperable, carry him back onto the bus.
5432040	5435640	So interesting. Cause if you're that person's doctor and you go like, okay,
5435640	5442280	so it looks like you're incredibly miserable, um, right before you go on stage and do this character
5442280	5447320	that you've been doing for 40 years. And then you go back to being miserable. Have you considered?
5447320	5451880	But this is, that's easy for me to say because I'm not a standup. I don't have the discipline,
5451880	5458120	like, you know, which is going to be a dying craft thanks to assholes like me in this technology
5458200	5463000	where it's like, I just want a guy I can relate to. And it's like, well, then how will you ever
5463000	5466840	become a Gilbert Gottfried? How will you ever become Patton Oswalt? Does Gilbert have like any
5466840	5472280	depression? Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, these get that classic thing that a lot of celebrities have
5472280	5476120	of this is all going to go away someday. Like this could be gone tomorrow. The phone could
5476120	5480040	stop ringing. He talks about that in the movie. A lot of standups. I know a lot of like really
5480040	5487080	successful comedians have a certain degree of depression that like, there's, there's, there's a
5487080	5492280	real, I think, I think happiness makes him depressed. Right. No, that's, that's a very,
5492280	5499480	Dino and I talk about that all the time. Yeah. Like we, we consume our happiness through sadness,
5499480	5504520	which if you're a biology student, it makes a lot more sense. It doesn't sound as paradoxical
5504520	5510200	because that's what digestion is. You get, you, you take things in from the outside world and you,
5510200	5516520	you use like catalyzing enzymes to subvert them, change them, and you make them into something
5516520	5523160	that you can then draw energy from. And like Dino and I are like cynics. So if there's a reason
5523160	5529480	to be happy, like for instance, Hey, are movies nominated for an Oscar? Um, you know, we're not
5529480	5535160	going to just, we can't just take that form of energy and translate it into something that powers
5535160	5543080	us. We have to pour booze or jokes or self-loathing or self-destruction on that so we can like suck it
5543080	5548600	up, like Brundle fly into our system, you know, like, um, and I, and I do, and, but, but for that
5548600	5555480	reason, I do find that like people think that I'm more fucked up than I feel, but I think that
5555480	5562840	people perceive me as less happy than I am because if I'm happy, you'll know, because I'm listening
5562840	5569240	to M83 and like, like, like sound like I'm about to blow my brains out. But it's like, because that's
5569240	5573800	when I'm like, I'm Tony Stark. What's there left to do but be Bruce Wayne? You know, I'm going to
5573800	5578600	like look out the window at Gotham and like drink a drink and be like, fuck this world.
5579480	5584040	The times that I, that I've, I look back on our friendship, Dan, as of like the times I thought
5584040	5589880	of you as you're kind of your most open and happy weren't the times where you were totally on top
5589880	5594920	of the world. Like you are happy now because like things are going well and you are happy. But
5594920	5602840	when we were really struggling and confused and didn't know where, like where we were going or
5602840	5609080	what was going to happen, like there was a, like a freefall like feeling of like joy in that. There
5609080	5615080	was for some of that, but then when you were successful and I wasn't, you know, I remember
5615080	5619480	you saying to me, we got in a fight in an instant message and I, something that you said that stuck
5619480	5624840	with me. Cause I was like, he's right. I was like, or not right, but right or wrong. When I was like,
5624840	5629960	listen to this, take this in that you said, like, I don't even, I'm starting to tell you less about
5629960	5637560	my successes because I don't want to hear you have to choke out a congratulations, which was like,
5637560	5641720	you know, I've observed that in other people. It was like there, that's important to note,
5641720	5645400	you know, cause I also, now that I'm in my forties, I'm like, ah, man, when we were in our twenties
5645400	5651000	and we were broke, we were so happy. Yeah. But then one of your 20 year, we were happy in each
5651000	5657720	other's arms, spiraling down a drain. Well, we needed, we needed friendship to survive. And so
5657720	5663560	that felt like joy because we would hug and cry. Friendship is more intense and a lot easier when
5663560	5670360	there's no money changing hands. That's what it is. Friendship, family, that makes you happy.
5670360	5677800	And, and, and so when you're broke, like you have a much easier chance of, of having like really
5677800	5683640	strong friendships. Yeah. And really, we needed each other to make it like you were paying my
5683640	5686680	bills and then I was paying your bills and then you were paying my bills. Yeah. And if we had it
5686680	5690920	all to do over again, we might go, maybe it's not about making it. Maybe we nailed it with the
5690920	5696040	friendship. Anyways, but I did want to say what, well, I wanted to ask one thing, which was that,
5696600	5701640	because, well, that says it's something that really annoys me at the TCAs or whatever when
5701640	5706280	people ask. It's like as a person who's famous for putting his foot in his mouth and saying
5706280	5711160	fucked up things and like Gilbert's got the whole too soon experience and the
5711160	5715960	athlete firing all his stuff. Like I hate it when people ask me this, but I am curious about it with
5715960	5723080	Gilbert. Are there any regrets? Like, like, would you do it different? Would I, does he,
5723080	5728200	does he address that in the movie? Do you ask him that in the movie? Like, no, would you,
5728200	5732600	would you go back and like, he's famous for that moment in the, in the roast where he does the
5732600	5739160	first 9 11 joke on like 9 12. And the closest we get to addressing that is that that Affleck
5739160	5743640	thing only made him more popular. You know, he said nothing. He would say it certainly put him
5743640	5748600	on the right side of comedic history. Yeah. Yeah. Nothing he's ever done has hurt him that bad. And
5748600	5751960	most of the things he's done has propelled him. Like, you know, Jeff Ross says at the end of the
5751960	5756520	movie, you know, he sells out. He's more popular than ever. He's gigging all the time. You know,
5756520	5759800	so yeah, that's fantastic here. Yeah. Cause I, that's what I always say to those people. I'm
5759800	5764120	like, I don't know. I don't have anything to compare it to. I run my mouth. I burned my bridges.
5764120	5768680	I fucking, but here I am. I'm very happy. Like I don't regret anything. I don't want to go back
5768680	5774440	in time and like say the perfect thing to, uh, the New York times in that one interview. And I'm
5774440	5778920	sorry. I made that one joke. I'm sorry that that offended people, but like, I think that the, the,
5778920	5784600	the biggest thing you and Wayne and Gilbert have in common and people like you is that you're going
5784600	5789000	to do it, but you don't think about the money or the success or the failure. You do this thing,
5789000	5793480	you put it out there, whether it works or not. Like I think, but I think everyone wants to be
5793480	5797400	like that. Everyone wants to, everyone would love, just not push people around and be a
5797400	5801720	raging maniac, but just people would like to do whatever they want to do that day. Yeah. To find
5801720	5807160	out like that's what's great about documentaries, especially like, I mean, all film, they're all
5807160	5815640	good film is that there's permission to be strange permission to be odd and flawed. And there's, uh,
5817640	5823240	there's like a liberating feeling when you watch that, like, like to know that, like, yeah, you can
5823240	5830760	be sad and still be funny and you can be lonely and still be happy occasionally. And you can,
5830760	5836840	you know, you can make it and feel like a failure. Yeah. So can you, can you, we don't all get to
5836840	5842040	have a moment in our lives captured in an hour and a half movie. Can you watch that objectively
5842040	5847480	and see a different person can feel different now? Or can you? I don't know. I haven't watched it.
5847480	5853480	I can't. I mean, like, do you feel, cause you had a lot going on then, like personally and
5853480	5858520	professionally, a lot going on now, but do you feel like a happier person or? Definitely happier.
5858520	5865000	Yeah. Well, that's really weird. I don't want to say like, like, like, I saw a kid, like I call
5865000	5870360	everybody kids, but, but, but like, there was a kid that made a YouTube video that I don't know
5870360	5875160	how I ended up here. Cause I can't Google myself anymore, but I wound up on some YouTube video
5876040	5882360	and it was like, I don't know, something like Dan Harmon, uh, it didn't say Dan Harmon's a piece of
5882360	5886680	garbage and here's why. So I bothered to click on it, but it was something like Dan Harmon, uh,
5888040	5892840	and the meta narrative or something like that. And it was, it was, it was a guy who was talking
5892920	5898680	about how he has been following my career since the beginning. And he was using clips of all work
5898680	5906520	from community and Rick and Morty and acceptable TV and, and, and the movie. And he was explaining
5906520	5915640	that, you know, just these sort of like weird things about how like, I don't even know how to
5915640	5921640	say it. Watching that YouTube video, which included so much of the documentary, which that it was a
5921640	5927560	tool that that guy used to put together a thesis that wasn't about how cool I was, but that was
5927560	5933560	about how cool he was allowed to be. I thought like, like how he was learning from me that, that,
5933560	5941960	that storytelling, uh, the fucking up, uh, succeeding, uh, uh, famous, rich, self-destructive,
5941960	5949960	uh, uh, uh, failure, failure, uh, uh, impoverished, like death life. Like, like, like who gives a fuck
5949960	5955800	like, like, like shove them all in a thing. You're not going to get to manage your image. And like,
5955800	5961560	the guy was like clearly drawing some permission from that to do what he wanted to do. And I was,
5961560	5966920	I was exceptionally happy in that moment of that, that we made this movie, even though we haven't
5966920	5974360	made a goddamn dime off of it. Wait, no, nobody ever made money. No, how, we had, we had a million
5974360	5979080	t-shirts. I don't understand. I was, the reason we made that movie, you know, we did perfectly
5979080	5983000	Frank is because I was, I was watching an Apple TV. There'd just be documentaries every week and
5983000	5988440	come up and go, I went backpacking across Iraq and I sure made some new friends. And I'd be like,
5988440	5993240	this motherfucker is rich right now. And I'm not. It was the Craigslist movie. You can bring that.
5994680	5999640	I thought I'd use Craig's list to Craig some lists. This documentary is called Craig Liston.
6000600	6005800	You know, we should do guys. And I'm, I'm only, no, I'm not joking. We, let's do the European tour
6005800	6008680	and then it's the Steve Levy story. Like, like we, we have to,
6008680	6012280	No, I mean, but, but, but, but we have to agree. We're not doing it for money.
6012280	6014440	No. No, that's what I understand.
6014440	6016600	You're going to lose a hundred grand on the tour bus.
6016600	6019560	Fantastic. Like a good 45th birthday present to myself.
6019560	6024040	Let's, let's do that again. I mean, with that, and be honest, like, like,
6024040	6029480	is there any angle that makes you as a filmmaker want to go do that or, or just go hang out?
6029480	6032760	I think it'd be fun. It'd be great. Like I, some of the choices we made,
6032760	6035800	like we brought every, remember we brought rolls of green screen. Like we,
6035800	6040200	We thought, we thought there was a chance we were going to be doing a sketch show.
6040200	6042920	We had those ear cameras that we thought were going to wear these all the time.
6042920	6047720	We wore those twice. However, like when we got, you know, I mean,
6047720	6051160	like the one of you in the bathroom on the bus, you cast a wide net and I'm wearing a
6051160	6057560	fucking lipstick cam on my ear in a drunken blackout. Uh, and the entire time he was editing
6057560	6062360	the thing, I'm like, I got, I got that ear cam at home. I got that thumb drive. And I was like,
6062360	6066120	I would have, I would be like, I still got it. It's like, I was like, so time was like,
6066120	6073480	God damn it. Your movie doesn't have this moment. I think it's on my ear cam because I woke up with
6073480	6080040	it on my ear and a solo cup in my hand. Uh, there also is a thing that, uh, that
6081080	6084840	like, I don't do drugs. I don't do coke anymore, but apparently the last time I did,
6084840	6089240	it was caught on audio that there, there was audio of me. Can we tell that story?
6089240	6095320	I fuck you. I don't care. I don't do it anymore. So we can talk about the past, but the last time
6095320	6100840	I did it was on that tour. Yeah. And I had a little bit left with me. There's two parts of
6100840	6105000	that story though. Okay. There's me hearing about it and then me telling Dan. The first part is
6105000	6108680	I was called in the edit bay and they go, Hey, um, we don't know what to do with this,
6108680	6112280	but there's no picture. It's just audio. Anyway, here he goes. And it was, it was,
6113160	6115480	don't stop believing.
6118680	6124040	It was a super, it was a power mix of like five cities in a row. And I was like,
6124040	6130360	the formula didn't waver. He doesn't know anyone's listening. It's just a small town girl.
6133000	6136760	We were wearing microphones the entire time. I could go to the bathroom. No one's, no one's
6136760	6141880	listening. There was, there was a, there was a, uh, come on down to Harman town.
6144280	6148520	And then I came in and told Dan, I said, yeah. And he goes, when, when was this? And I said,
6148520	6152680	Brooklyn, he goes, you go that motherfucker. Of course. I asked him every night if he had any.
6153640	6157480	Well, I had some all the way to Brooklyn. I had some at the very beginning and then I found
6157480	6162680	the rest of it at the end, I think. That's why Coke's no good kids. Like go get a prescription
6162680	6169080	to Adderall. Coke, I, I, I, I, I stopped doing Coke when I got my Adderall prescription.
6169800	6175080	I, and I, I also stopped lying to my friends, you know, like, and stopped,
6175080	6178360	and stopped like putting myself in situations where I might get pistol whipped.
6178360	6181240	But the best was, it was the singing between lies.
6181240	6184680	No, that's the thing is like, you would fall in love with Jeff as a character in a sitcom,
6184680	6190040	because it was like so faithful. The bathroom door hinges and then a classic,
6190040	6193960	a standard being flawlessly in toned and then a tap and then a.
6196680	6197560	Just between two.
6200920	6206760	I, I admire your sensitivity because you asked me and said, hey, we're not going to ever show this.
6206760	6210360	We're not going to use it in the film. Like, do you want me to destroy? There's only four
6210360	6214920	people know about it. I'm like, yeah, let's, let's just leave that. But time has passed
6214920	6223320	and we can talk about that. That trip was so fun. I want to find a reason to do that
6223320	6225720	any other time again. You do it all the time,
6225720	6229160	but there is, you mentioned it once. There is that feeling like you do feel like a rock band
6229160	6233240	walking into these clubs with your cameras and you know, it is like a cool.
6233240	6237160	The tour bus getting on and off those buses. Well, I tend to process everything through
6237160	6241000	negativity and regret instead of just going, oh, that was so fun. But it's like the,
6241000	6244760	the most enthusiastic thing I can say about the idea of doing that again
6245800	6250360	is God damn it. I, it was wasted on me because I watched the documentary and I'm like,
6251240	6256680	motherfucker, CBS don't give a shit about your script. It ain't never going to be on CBS.
6256680	6260120	Because you weren't writing it. Well, I was trying, but it was like, it was like,
6260120	6263960	don't like just have fun. There was that beautiful moment when Aaron was helping you
6263960	6268120	with it. When you and Aaron like, like actually were working together, that was a really beautiful
6268120	6273080	like relationship moment. There are people right now waiting for work from me that it's like,
6273080	6277960	it's like, come on, this is just part of the, like, like, fuck it. Like, like my definition
6277960	6284280	of when I was unacceptably over a deadline was as dumb as my decision to take those jobs
6284280	6291800	and as dumb as my decision to not have the time of my life in on this bus. The question would be,
6292520	6298120	am I the kind of person that just can't have fun? You know, can I not go, Jesus Christ,
6298120	6305480	I'm on a tour bus. This rules. This is so fun. Well, I think that it goes back to that stress
6305480	6310360	of happiness. You find a way to screw that up maybe. It's, it's, well, it's, but I've been in
6310360	6314440	therapy since then, which is something that I swore against back, you know, in those days,
6314440	6318760	I was somebody that was famous for my rants about how therapy is not worth it. And I've been in
6318760	6325160	therapy since. And one of the things I've been unpacking is the fact is the possibility of being
6325160	6330040	addicted to stress and misery and stuff. And because it's your comfort zone, because comfort's
6330040	6335080	different from happiness. And you're just like, Oh, I know, I know what to do. I'll be overworked.
6335080	6340600	I'll have a, I'll have a deadline. I'll, I'll, I'll have shit to do. And I do think what's changed,
6340600	6346200	because ask anybody that's waiting for work for me right now, I'm not under that stress
6346200	6351480	much to their sugar and they're going to get their money back. I'm like, I've now entered
6351480	6359080	this like new age, I think where I'm like, fuck work. Like it's the dumbest and it will not prove
6359080	6364360	that you're a good person and it will not make you happy. And uh, so, but you're, you're, you're,
6364360	6371720	I mean, tell me if I'm wrong. You're, you're work is a huge part of like your identity. Yeah,
6371720	6377160	no shit. And that's, and that is like, I'm not going to say that's the problem because if I,
6378840	6385720	like, like that's not good. Like, like that, that's because that doesn't last. If your work
6385720	6392440	is your identity, guess what? Yeah. Then you stop existing. But then it's, but I mean, why do I,
6392440	6397080	like, why shouldn't I believe that you're ever going to stop doing that? I think like, that's,
6397080	6402920	that's what you love. You love, you love creating things. You love getting unconditional love from
6402920	6406360	strangers because you made a good thing. I think the thing that'll change is, I think the thing
6406360	6412840	that is changing now is that is that Rick and Morty, quite frankly, if I can open source my
6412840	6420040	career here for a second, Rick and Morty was always a wonderful, amazing, incredible, fun thing to
6420040	6429400	execute that was always about half of my overhead of living. My price of freedom, the price that I
6429400	6440120	have to pay my masters in order to eat, shit, fuck, jerk off, watch, sleep, blah, blah, blah,
6440120	6446040	whenever I want in whatever quantity I want, pick up the tab when I go to dinner, fly first class,
6446040	6451640	wherever I go, say yes to any time anyone says come here, fly here. There's a, there's a, there's
6451640	6458680	a nut on that, as they say in grody boiler room language, there's an overhead. It's a little over
6458680	6465640	half a million dollars a year. Rick and Morty for the duration of my contract was like generating
6465640	6472280	around half of that. So I had to like, number one, I couldn't just do Rick and Morty. Number two,
6472920	6478760	I had to always dread Rick and Morty going the route of community because Rick and Morty started
6478760	6484200	as an exit strategy from community. So now everything that's changed, it's like Rick and Morty,
6485000	6489560	it's not going to stay this like incredible like, holy shit, what's this show? Everyone wants to
6489560	6498920	talk about it to the point where variety is printing headlines, sadly, awkwardly trying to link us to
6498920	6503080	Harvey Weinstein. I mean, that's when you know you've really succeeded when there's like
6503080	6508760	clickbait headlines that are like, what does Harvey Weinstein have to do with Beavis and Butthead?
6508760	6514920	Like, that's when you know you're Beavis and Butthead. The answer is nothing except fucking clicks.
6516600	6522760	So this is a show with momentum. This is a show that I could, I can settle into, and I can pay
6522760	6528280	myself to actually do. And that's a huge difference from when you knew me and from the
6528280	6533960	last, that's the thing that's changed, is that I can actually go, oh, I don't think Turner's going
6533960	6540360	to go out of business. I don't, and unless the world just literally like collapses. And if it
6540360	6547880	does, then who cares? Like, I now can see that I can have one job. And that's never been the case
6547880	6553080	since I was 11. That's great. Well, now get fired from it so we can make another documentary with
6553080	6557320	Neil Berkley. No, I want to do the documentary where I'm happy. All right. Thank you, everybody.
6557320	6563080	That's been our harm in town. Steve Levy. We didn't even play Dungeons and Dragons. We don't
6563080	6568520	have Spencer. There's no Spencer tonight. Neil Berkley, everybody. Thank you, Neil. And check
6568520	6574680	out his movie, Gilbert. If you're not a Gilbert Godfried fan already, you will be afterwards.
6574680	6581000	And if not, go YouTube the hell out of him. He's one of my comedic heroes of all time.
6581000	6584280	I was always looking at the thing. It's at 113, isn't that?
6584920	6588520	Doesn't that mean that we've done seven minutes less than two hours?
6588520	6594040	Yeah, but you know, there's no Spencer. Let's thank Church and Nolan and Chris and Sarah and
6594040	6599400	Brendan out there doing everything for us. I like it here in the booth. It's comfortable.
6599400	6603880	Yeah. Who's that guy on Twitter that did the fuck your mama rap? Did you hear that thing?
6603880	6606440	No, no. Church, who's that guy?
6607560	6615320	Anybody know the guy's name on YouTube? Holy smokes. If you go to my tweets and my re-tweets,
6615320	6620360	there's a cat that did a giant fuck your mama rap that is so good. Can we find it?
6620360	6622520	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hold on. Yeah, if we can pull it up.
6623800	6626440	Well, don't make me jealous. No, no. You're going to be jealous.
6626440	6629480	Should I open for him? Can I warm up? Let me see if I can find it.
6629480	6635480	Yo, yo. Yeah, you open. Yo, yo, yo. Drop a beat on my foot.
6636440	6642040	I saw your mama in the mall. I fucked her like a pack of Paul walls. I saw your mama.
6642040	6647640	She was six feet tall. I saw her pussy and I said, that's it, y'all. I climbed up and I went
6647640	6654920	in her womb. I saw your mama in a tomb. I went to New Orleans. It got flooded. I saw your mama
6655000	6661800	and said, what did that do to me? And she said, it gave you pee. And I said,
6662440	6667080	I need more than pee. And she said, why don't I teach you the ABCs? And she said,
6667080	6675160	A stands for B stands for fuck. I couldn't, I couldn't, I thought that was, I thought that
6675160	6680120	was going to go somewhere. All right. Yo, Neil Berkeley's mama was born in a titty,
6681080	6687160	New York city. She came out the nipple and said, it's me. My son's going to make documentaries.
6687720	6693080	So he grabbed a camera, followed her around and he only had picture, no sound. That's called
6693080	6700440	MLS and it's from Otto Preminger, I think. No? All right. Yo, if you're a film major, what's up?
6701240	6707720	Where'd your degree get you? What's up? I dropped out of Marquette and now I have more money than
6707720	6714040	Patricia Arquette. We don't know that. We don't know that. That's unverifiable. No one's going to
6714040	6719640	argue it though. All right. Okay. It's verifiable. We can find out right now. Yeah. Patricia Arquette
6719640	6726760	is a wealthy woman. I saw your mama. Okay. Right. I can't rhyme that. Okay. All right. Here we go.
6726760	6737480	Yo, I'm not thinking of rhymes right now. I'm just waiting for a time.
6738360	6742200	Church or somebody out there. I can't find the link to that. Your mom was a sandwich. That guy's
6742200	6747240	right. You should have ham and cheese and I got to hand it to her. She'd have a side of pickles.
6747240	6752600	I fuck your mom so hard. She got fickle about it. Said, maybe I want it. Maybe I don't. I said, well,
6752600	6758360	it needs to be consensual. So I will wait for your answer. I found it. You're a private dancer. So come
6758360	6763080	in and I gave her the time of her life. All right. I'm going to unplug out of my thing and go into my
6763080	6767640	phone. Oh wait. No shit. I don't have the phone thing. Doesn't have the phone thing. What do you
6767640	6771720	mean? You can plug, you can unplug your iPad. No, but I don't have the jack cause I got the new phone.
6772600	6778200	Send me the link. Send me the link. I'll do it. Okay. The guy's name is Rob Tancham.
6780120	6784760	There's a fucking story I have to tell about code and Cody that, that like I,
6784760	6789960	it's got to wait till next week, but that's good that we have a backlog of material.
6793880	6799960	But can we also do Jeff, is that if you're going to have, if you have the ability to play like live,
6799960	6807320	like, like, like, like, can you find, like, get like a, um, uh, a, uh, new age kind of like star
6807320	6813720	field, like, like hypnotic thing. Let's do like improvised, like, uh, uh, hypnosis tapes for people.
6814360	6819960	Are we allowed to play this on the show? Um, yeah, let's do it. Uh, yeah, here's the jack.
6819960	6822840	Let's just do this and get out of here because we're going wrong. All right. We're not going,
6822840	6826920	I mean, it's, you know, we're going like looped around. I got karaoke to do in front of
6826920	6836200	bronco to drink. Yeah. I miss my girlfriend. I've been out of town. Okay. Uh, this guy,
6840200	6846040	this is amazing. Listen closely. I'm about to offer up a comprehensive account of all the mama's
6846040	6850200	I fucked the compilation of my calculation with the mama population from a top to
6850200	6854680	college. I went through the bottom of the basement. It's a common conversation. Far as I'm concerned,
6854680	6859480	cause I fucked every mama everywhere around the world from Manhattan to Pakistan and then back
6859480	6865080	again, except a handful of nations impacted by the travel ban. I fucked your mama. Yo, yo, I beat the
6865080	6869000	odds to suck my cock until like half of the globe and all the ladies that just stayed in life. I'm
6869000	6874120	macking on those. They carry babies. Now they made me make my packages flow. Bro. Yeah. I fucked your
6874120	6879960	mama. Yo, I gave a plenty D. She gave you 23 of your chromosomes. This is an overdose of poetic. Yo,
6879960	6885800	mama jokes who settle in. I'm milking this milk fit. I fucked your mama in the rough like a diamond.
6885800	6891160	Stuck it up a month. Then I nutted on the island. I fucked your mama on my own private island. Took
6891160	6896520	a private jet, got a wet with my private. I fucked your mama in the middle of the ocean, in the belly
6896520	6901000	of the whale stream. I load all over both tests. I fucked your mama. Then she gave me a promotion.
6901000	6906040	She's promoting from within. Cause my dick is in the ocean. Yeah. I fucked your mama. Yo,
6906040	6909800	I'm sleeping with her, but she didn't bring pajamas though. Cause she sleeps in the
6909800	6914280	pub with the teeth around my nuts. Then I stopped your mama like she was an envelope. I fucked your
6914280	6919880	mama on a pile of avastan. Don't need to lick it even cause your mama's hella damn. But obviously
6919880	6924360	I go down on it. Then I go to town on it. Then I fucked the rest of the town cause I'm the mama
6924360	6929560	champ. I caught a mama fucking fetish. I'll say my two meaty mamas on a better lettuce. I eat your
6929560	6933560	mama's pussy cause she said I had to finish that before I ate dessert. You know how mamas be
6933560	6938120	getting overprotective. I fucked your mama at the dentist. She took me for a clean and put
6938120	6942200	my penis in a dance split. I fucked your mama on the court after her game of tennis when she
6942200	6946520	needed an abortion. Took your mama to the clinic and I fucked her there. Your mama stuck rushing
6946520	6950920	through to holding my underwear. I say yo mama cause as far as names go, I'm unaware what your
6950920	6955560	mama's name is. This isn't mama dating. It's purely mama fucking on a no me mama basis.
6955560	6963640	Fuck your mama, why? Cause no one told me not to. Now I run a mama brothel. All for me,
6963640	6971320	they always offering to make waffles. I fucked a billion ladies who have raised children lately.
6971320	6976200	I get the feeling I've become the soulless mama fucking villain.
6976200	6982120	Huh, strange, I feel nothing. I fucked your mama then I busted on her stomach. A couple months ago
6982120	6986680	this was a rush but something changed. I've adjusted now my pulse is barely budging. I fucked
6986680	6992200	your mama on a dragon in a dungeon. Your mama loved it but for me it wasn't fun as time it doesn't.
6992200	6996760	This is the hero's repercussion, but so the ultimate boom. But lo and behold got multiple
6996760	7002680	poops. Suddenly it's joyless, it feels pointless. Nevertheless, I fucked your mama on a toilet.
7002680	7006840	I fucked your mama in a pond filled with koi fish. I fucked your mama with an ant and don't want to take
7006840	7013240	a poison. Don't want to watch it. No it doesn't. Wait is it fading out? Yeah that's a booth fade. Rob
7013240	7022680	Tanchum. He just booth faded out because he's got nine more minutes of it. He could just keep going
7022680	7028040	forever. He's like tapioca pudding. I fucked your mama in Afghanistan then back again and a couple
7028040	7033560	countries impacted by the travel van. He became very self-aware at the end there. No yeah at the end
7033560	7037880	that's what I told him at the end. He lost his joy. It got joyless and pointless and I fucked her
7037880	7041160	on the toilet. He's like he doesn't know. All right that's been harm in town. We're gonna
7041160	7045240	we're gonna booth fade out. Thank you so much Neil Berkeley. Let's find that guy and bring him in.
7045240	7050280	Hell yeah that's that's gorgeous shit Rob. Thank you for that. We love you all. That was great to
7050280	7070360	us. Did you get any of that? It's a good show.
