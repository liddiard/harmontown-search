0	15000	From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, Harman Town is now in session.
15000	26000	Let's take this moment to realize that the music that you're hearing over the last three
27000	31000	is the first one currently made for you by Jordy White.
36000	39000	Let's bring in Spencer Crichton and everybody.
45000	47000	Rob Schwab.
57000	62000	From the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
72000	74000	Can I get a collective yup?
74000	86000	Yeah, Dave Klein, that's a reference to Dave Klein for new subscribers.
86000	92000	Dave Klein, can I tell, is it okay to talk about the gift you gave me on the sidewalk?
92000	97000	The gift of untolicited hand jobs.
97000	101000	It was a big giant gold joint.
102000	104000	The paper was gold.
104000	106000	24 carat.
106000	108000	24 carat.
108000	112000	I recently have overvaped.
112000	117000	I was like, I'll do the Dave Klein joint.
117000	127000	The last couple of weekends, that's some serious fucking yup.
127000	129000	That was burpin'.
130000	132000	Made my brain go yup.
132000	135000	What is that? Is that the indica or the sativa?
135000	137000	It was a really magnificent sativa.
137000	139000	Okay, so sativa, that's my jam.
139000	142000	Someone write that down because I can never remember.
142000	148000	My mnemonic device was, I would get high and then I would go,
148000	154000	all right, all right, I get too high on indica.
154000	157000	And then the next time I'd get high, I'd go like,
157000	160000	what is it, I love indica?
160000	163000	What's with the gold paper?
163000	165000	There's paper around it that's gold?
165000	167000	What's up with that?
167000	168000	I don't know.
168000	170000	What's up with that?
170000	173000	So, game recognize game.
176000	178000	Game recognize game, he told you.
178000	181000	Oh, I still don't know.
181000	184000	That's a reference from an old episode of Harmontown
184000	186000	where Kumail was out here, right?
186000	190000	Oh, God, I miss Kumail so much.
190000	192000	We lost Kumail to Hollywood.
192000	195000	You know what? Fuck Kumail.
195000	196000	Fuck Kumail.
196000	199000	Like, if Kumail, if he came out right now,
199000	202000	I'd punch him in his fucking face.
203000	206000	Kumail Najiani, everybody!
206000	208000	What? No!
208000	210000	No!
211000	214000	No!
235000	238000	You know, punch him, Dan. Punch him.
239000	241000	You know, I haven't been here in a while,
241000	244000	but I haven't changed. I'm still the same guy.
244000	246000	I've always been.
246000	249000	We were worried, Kumail, that Hollywood might have changed you a bit.
249000	250000	Oh, no, no, no.
250000	253000	That being on the cover of Wired magazine might have changed.
253000	257000	No, no, dude, you know me. I'm grounded as fuck.
257000	259000	Both feet on the ground.
259000	261000	Nothing is different about me.
261000	263000	Not to spring a pop quiz on you,
263000	267000	but three of Doctor Friend's attributes.
270000	272000	He's just very grounded.
275000	277000	Who's Doctor Friend?
279000	281000	Wasn't that his old D&D character?
281000	286000	I mean, his old D&D character is wrong on many levels.
286000	289000	I mean, he never played him, I don't think, right?
289000	290000	No, I played...
290000	291000	Once, right?
291000	293000	Mr. Berg, and I played Doctor Friend.
293000	295000	Oh, once with the crown!
297000	300000	Oh, oh, this, yeah, I'm sorry. It's from...
300000	301000	He was cold.
301000	305000	I was gonna say, it's great that Harmon Town has evolved to the point
305000	308000	where people are doing walk-on bits now, you know?
308000	313000	Yeah, heavily visual bits for a podcast.
313000	317000	Yeah, last week, Shrob was vacuuming the podium or some shit.
317000	320000	That was great. What was the bit there?
320000	323000	I was vacuuming the podium.
325000	328000	It was great for the listeners at home.
329000	331000	Why were you vacuuming the podium?
331000	335000	Rob found a giant stand-up, old-timey standing vacuum.
335000	337000	It was dirty.
337000	339000	And he actually vacuumed my...
339000	342000	This is the world's largest podium, right?
342000	344000	Has it gotten bigger?
344000	347000	It feels like it's growing and encroaching.
347000	350000	Thank you for noticing, Camille.
350000	353000	By the way, Dad has not said a fucking word.
353000	355000	He was supposed to punch you.
355000	356000	He was supposed to punch you.
356000	358000	Laughy pants is back.
358000	361000	I'm sorry. It's like his laugh and...
361000	362000	Who's the laughy pants?
362000	364000	He's the happiest guy in the world.
364000	367000	You can't yell at him for having a laugh.
368000	370000	His laugh is...
370000	372000	His laugh is... it's present.
373000	376000	He's the guy. Everyone's always like, who's that laughing?
376000	378000	No, but that was a different guy.
378000	380000	Yeah, it's a different guy.
380000	382000	Wait, what the... what?
382000	383000	Yeah.
383000	385000	Well, tell him. Whatever...
385000	387000	We know. We know, right?
387000	389000	All right. All right.
389000	390000	Well...
390000	393000	I don't get it. I don't get what's so funny.
393000	396000	And now I've done it. Now I feel like I've done a terrible thing.
396000	397000	What have you done?
397000	399000	Who's the original laughing guy?
399000	400000	That's Doug.
400000	402000	That's Doug. And we have a new laughing guy?
402000	403000	Yes.
404000	407000	You've usurped the laughing crowd.
408000	409000	There you go.
409000	413000	But more than those two people laugh during the show, I hope.
414000	416000	I know, but you heard his laugh and now you can't hear it.
416000	417000	Now I feel like I like...
417000	418000	You killed it.
418000	420000	Is there a way to isolate each of their laughs
420000	423000	and have like an American Idol laugh-off kind of thing?
423000	427000	What if we have a laugh-off right now who can do the proudest thing?
427000	429000	All right. So nobody...
429000	432000	Nobody else is allowed to laugh.
432000	433000	Except for...
433000	436000	By the way, this is great, like, for a comedy show.
437000	440000	Don't laugh. We're doing a thing.
442000	445000	Okay. Shroff, make... Doug...
445000	447000	It's not my show.
448000	449000	It's not my show.
449000	452000	And Kumail hasn't been here in a while.
452000	454000	Yeah. I don't know how this works anymore.
454000	456000	Right. Help him out.
456000	458000	Is there a way to isolate each laugh
458000	460000	so we can find out what makes each laugh different
460000	462000	and special when it's on the way?
462000	463000	No.
464000	467000	I don't think there's a way to do that.
468000	470000	Spencer, I think you're selling the show short.
470000	473000	I think probably if I told a joke, I could...
473000	475000	But it has to be a joke that's only funny to one...
475000	476000	Yeah, exactly.
476000	478000	...one of those two and nobody else.
478000	479000	I said...
479000	480000	Can we...
480000	481000	Can we...
481000	482000	Can we...
482000	483000	Can we isolate, like, with a laser?
483000	485000	Dan, tell each of them, like, singularly a joke.
485000	487000	Yeah. Like, what's funny to you?
487000	489000	What's your favorite, like, topic?
489000	490000	That's funny.
490000	492000	That nobody else thinks is funny.
492000	493000	Time travel.
493000	495000	Time travel. He likes time travel, Dan.
495000	496000	Tell him a time travel joke.
496000	497000	Tell him a time travel joke.
497000	500000	Oh, yeah, I already told you. One yesterday.
501000	503000	No, the point is that only he laughs.
503000	505000	This is what I was saying.
505000	506000	This is what I was saying.
506000	508000	Stop laughing!
508000	510000	Stop it! You're fucking up this shit!
510000	512000	You're fucking up the bit!
512000	514000	Now stop laughing!
514000	516000	Please tell the joke again.
516000	517000	Stop it!
517000	520000	I already told him the joke 30 seconds ago.
520000	521000	Okay.
521000	522000	All right.
522000	523000	We got a taste of that.
523000	524000	All right.
524000	526000	It's not going to work at all.
526000	527000	No, no, no.
527000	528000	I got a taste of that.
528000	530000	I'm not a fan.
530000	532000	So it's yours to lose.
532000	533000	Oh, yeah, he won.
533000	534000	But think of it.
534000	536000	The guy behind him, you gave him that crown,
536000	537000	and the guy behind him is like...
537000	539000	So now his laugh and his head?
539000	540000	Okay.
540000	542000	I was like, I'm hyper-conscious.
542000	543000	I want everyone to be happy.
543000	545000	Wait. Laugh for guy number two.
545000	546000	What is your name?
546000	547000	Louis.
547000	548000	Louis. We have Doug and Louis.
548000	549000	Laugh for one.
549000	550000	Laugh for two.
550000	551000	Throughout the show, we're going to find out.
551000	552000	We're going to...
552000	554000	I'll keep an eye on this.
554000	556000	I have a little chart over here.
556000	558000	I'm going to be graphing their laughter.
558000	560000	That's the worst thing I've ever seen.
560000	561000	I feel like a super-villain.
561000	565000	I'm like, who's laughing so mirthily?
565000	566000	It's terrible.
566000	568000	What do we need?
568000	570000	Well, I hear all we need.
570000	574000	Maybe just the one we deserve.
574000	575000	All right.
575000	578000	Now that I've cooled down the crowd,
578000	581000	we have a lot of friends here tonight.
581000	582000	And I want to...
582000	583000	I want to...
583000	584000	We have a friend here.
584000	585000	You know him.
585000	586000	Yeah.
586000	587000	Hello, Dan.
587000	591000	I haven't seen you in a week.
591000	593000	I thought we were drifting apart,
593000	595000	but it's good to know that we're still friends.
595000	596000	No.
596000	598000	I just saw you at dinner.
598000	601000	Have you ever eaten dinner with Rob Schwab at a restaurant?
601000	602000	No.
602000	603000	What's it like?
603000	604000	Well, uh...
604000	605000	Is it like the waiters?
605000	607000	Like, here's our specials, and the trap's like,
607000	612000	are there any specials?
612000	613000	Is it...
613000	616000	Is it that shit?
616000	617000	It has been.
617000	619000	It has been.
619000	622000	Well, let me ask you this.
622000	623000	The male...
623000	626000	Do you like vines at any point?
626000	628000	If you've ever really enjoyed vines?
628000	629000	Like, vines.
629000	631000	The vine app.
631000	632000	Do you like vines?
632000	634000	Do you like the vines?
634000	635000	The vines...
635000	637000	I feel like I'm being set up for some vines.
637000	639000	Have you ever enjoyed a vine at all?
639000	640000	Have you interested...
640000	641000	Are you familiar with vines?
641000	642000	Do you like...
642000	643000	Do you like vines in your mouth?
643000	644000	Do you like a vine?
644000	648000	Um, yeah, I've enjoyed a vine or two in my day.
648000	650000	Would you like the person sitting next to you
650000	654000	in a public restaurant to watch his favorite vines
654000	658000	at full volume?
658000	661000	Well, you don't talk to me.
662000	664000	I'm sitting there,
664000	666000	waiting for my food like a boob.
666000	669000	I tell you, turn it down.
669000	670000	You don't respond to that.
670000	672000	And then I go...
672000	676000	What do you want to talk about?
676000	678000	Yeah, because I'm fucking like...
678000	680000	I'm writing down on my phone
680000	683000	into my Harmontown topic list.
683000	684000	Talk about this guy...
684000	686000	Fucking address this shit.
686000	687000	Attention must be paid.
687000	689000	What was the vine that was...
689000	690000	I'll be the mediator.
690000	692000	What was the vine that was...
692000	693000	that was so urgent?
693000	695000	There is a couple of them.
695000	697000	Yeah, the best one was...
697000	699000	One that had definitely involved a fart
699000	701000	because it was like on a loop.
701000	703000	Whoop-a-chop-a!
703000	704000	Whoop-a-chop-a!
704000	705000	Whoop-a-chop-a!
705000	707000	And people are just looking and...
707000	709000	What is the restaurant?
709000	710000	What restaurant?
710000	711000	What's the level of restaurant we're talking about?
711000	712000	Spago.
712000	713000	No, I...
713000	714000	Spago!
714000	716000	It was Cheebo across the street,
716000	717000	but it's a fucking club.
717000	718000	Cheebo, you're McDonald's!
718000	719000	No!
719000	721000	I see people at Cheebo all the time!
721000	723000	No!
723000	725000	What was it let's listen to it and see...
740000	743000	Is there an award for a World's Best Podcast?
744000	747000	Is there an Emmys or Tonys or...
747000	749000	I'm a potty 8 year old!
749000	751000	I don't think anybody could hear it!
753000	756000	Was that... this was happening today, earlier today?
756000	757000	Yeah!
757000	759000	It happens every fucking time!
759000	761000	And everybody else was having a ball!
761000	763000	Everybody was like, oh I want to look at it!
763000	765000	Oh my gosh it's so funny!
765000	767000	So funny! This is great! Oh my god!
767000	769000	You send me...
769000	771000	Bum bum bum!
771000	773000	Just turn it down!
773000	774000	Dad says, stop!
774000	776000	Can you please turn down your vine?
776000	778000	I'm trying to eat my bread here!
778000	780000	I don't say that!
780000	782000	Your vines are disrupting my enjoyment of...
782000	784000	I'm not mine!
784000	786000	Strangers!
786000	788000	They were loving it too!
788000	790000	A guy on the way out was like,
790000	792000	hey you know, I'm not a fan of that shit
792000	794000	but you really, you know, took it above...
794000	796000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Okay, well...
796000	798000	You don't know!
798000	800000	You don't know! This is you!
800000	802000	Like, blinders! You don't care!
802000	804000	You don't care!
804000	806000	There's only one that's aware of strangers in public
806000	808000	when I'm with you.
808000	810000	You know, I've missed this!
814000	816000	Alright, let's bring out a friend of yours.
816000	818000	Yeah, bring up our friend.
818000	820000	A new friend of mine.
820000	822000	He's, well, you know...
822000	824000	Look.
826000	828000	Here's the thing.
828000	830000	Hulu has an original series.
830000	832000	Called Ghost Balloon.
832000	834000	It's about a guy with a ghost balloon.
834000	836000	That's right.
836000	838000	You've seen the billboards.
838000	840000	It's a guy holding a balloon.
840000	842000	It's a ghost.
842000	844000	It's actually called Deadbeat.
844000	846000	It's a Hulu original series.
846000	848000	It's about a guy named Pac who can see ghosts
848000	850000	and he helps him finish their...
850000	852000	I saw it on one of those bust up couches.
852000	854000	Yeah, and I never got...
854000	856000	Couches.
856000	858000	Are you a Beverly Hillbilly?
858000	860000	Yes.
863000	866000	For people that don't live in L.A.
866000	868000	If you live somewhere else,
868000	870000	our bust-ups have couches.
872000	874000	I always like the tagline of this show
874000	876000	because it's...
876000	878000	He helps ghosts, can't help himself
878000	880000	and I don't know if it's like,
880000	882000	is it, he helps ghosts, he can't help himself
882000	885000	or he helps ghosts, he can't help himself.
887000	889000	Well, let's get some information.
889000	891000	Please welcome Tyler LeBean.
892000	894000	Whoa!
904000	906000	Wow.
906000	908000	That was a classic,
908000	910000	classic introduction to a guy that you really don't know.
910000	912000	Yeah.
912000	914000	Thank you for dressing up for the show,
914000	916000	by the way.
916000	918000	You're dressed for a night in.
918000	920000	I got my pink flamingo shorts on.
920000	922000	I don't know if anybody's noticed that, but...
924000	926000	I'm jealous.
926000	928000	I mean, you know, not everyone can pull these off.
928000	930000	I'm jealous of those shorts,
930000	932000	I'm jealous of those calves.
934000	936000	They're muscular, muscular calves.
936000	938000	Spencer, you have great calves, Spencer.
938000	940000	Oh no, my calves are great, yeah.
942000	944000	And yet you still aspire to Tyler's calves.
944000	946000	Yeah.
946000	949000	I find that from carrying around this giant lumbering frame,
949000	952000	I tend to get very, very nice definition in my calves.
952000	953000	Exactly.
953000	955000	You guys know, guys who wear shorts a lot because you're fat.
957000	959000	Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.
959000	962000	Tyler, the fourth season of Deadbeat.
962000	964000	No, no.
964000	967000	The impending fourth season of Deadbeat.
967000	968000	The third, yeah.
968000	969000	This is the third one.
969000	971000	The third is about to come out on Wednesday, yeah.
971000	972000	Oh, okay.
972000	976000	Unless you had a question about the upcoming potential fourth season.
976000	978000	Yes, I did, but put a pin in it.
978000	979000	Yeah.
979000	981000	We'll come back to that one in like a year from now.
983000	985000	It's because my girlfriend co-created the show,
985000	988000	so I'm used to talking about the fourth season as the impending season.
988000	989000	Yeah, yeah.
989000	991000	The third season is about to air.
991000	993000	Yeah, or it's about to drop, as they say.
993000	996000	It's about to drop entirely in a binge fashion.
996000	998000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, in classic binging fashion.
998000	999000	On Hulu.
999000	1000000	On Hulu.
1000000	1003000	And by the way, people think that I'm paid by,
1003000	1005000	I mean, I am paid by Hulu, not to be here,
1005000	1008000	but I think that Hulu, does anybody have Hulu?
1008000	1009000	Yeah.
1009000	1011000	Okay, that's a fucking dope platform, is it not?
1011000	1013000	Again, I don't want to come off as like one of those guys,
1013000	1017000	it's like, hey, guys, I know I'm on a show on Hulu,
1017000	1020000	but Hulu is rad.
1020000	1021000	No, Hulu is rad.
1021000	1022000	It's good shit.
1022000	1024000	It's not as good as CISO though.
1024000	1026000	Huh?
1026000	1028000	None of you have CISO.
1028000	1030000	Talk about a rad platform.
1031000	1033000	Platform fight.
1033000	1035000	Platform fight.
1035000	1036000	Go 90.
1036000	1039000	HBO has been doing some cool stuff recently.
1046000	1047000	HBO.
1051000	1055000	HBO Canada's got some pretty tight shit too.
1055000	1057000	Is that what Deadbeat is on over there?
1057000	1059000	No, no, no, we're not quality.
1059000	1061000	We're not quality enough for HBO Canada.
1061000	1063000	I like vines.
1066000	1068000	All right.
1068000	1070000	I would like to see that vine later, by the way.
1070000	1071000	I'll show it to you.
1071000	1072000	Oh, no.
1072000	1074000	Let's continue over there.
1074000	1075000	Wait, wait, wait.
1075000	1076000	I got it.
1076000	1077000	What the?
1077000	1082000	For the listeners at home, he's going through his vines.
1082000	1084000	I'll get you a good one.
1090000	1092000	That was glasses.
1092000	1093000	That was the whole thing.
1093000	1094000	I was waiting for it to start.
1094000	1095000	It's a heaven.
1095000	1096000	It's a dog.
1096000	1097000	He just went on the back of it.
1097000	1098000	He turns around.
1098000	1101000	He's wearing sunglasses.
1101000	1102000	Well, now I get it.
1102000	1103000	Now it is funny.
1103000	1104000	That's funny.
1104000	1105000	I didn't catch it.
1105000	1106000	That's an away homer.
1106000	1107000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1107000	1108000	Once you explain it out.
1108000	1110000	It's an away homer, man.
1110000	1111000	All right.
1111000	1113000	I was like up till 3.30 in the morning,
1113000	1116000	and I'm texting my friends like vines.
1116000	1118000	I text it to Kate.
1118000	1120000	And I hear from the bedroom.
1120000	1122000	It's like 3.30 in the morning.
1122000	1123000	I'm trying to sleep.
1128000	1129000	All right.
1129000	1132000	Well, someone's got to write this.
1132000	1134000	Can I just check in right now?
1134000	1140000	I'm keeping a flow chart of Doug and Lewis's laughs.
1140000	1143000	Right now, I have a Venn diagram.
1143000	1147000	The center circle is CryptKeeper.
1147000	1151000	And then there's two op shoots, which is Joy and Evil.
1151000	1155000	And right now, they're both completely tied.
1155000	1158000	They're joyful slash evil CryptKeeper.
1158000	1160000	So I'll keep you informed.
1160000	1161000	There's a little update.
1161000	1162000	They're both fine.
1162000	1165000	You didn't feel embarrassed, did you, Lewis?
1165000	1166000	I didn't mean to.
1166000	1168000	I mean, obviously, I didn't mean to.
1168000	1173000	Why is this guy got a wheel like on his lap?
1173000	1176000	We're looking and no one's addressed the wheel.
1176000	1177000	He's got a wheel.
1177000	1179000	He's got a wheel and a shiny.
1179000	1180000	What's the wheel?
1180000	1181000	Show the wheel.
1181000	1182000	What's the wheel?
1182000	1183000	Show the wheel.
1183000	1184000	Oh.
1184000	1185000	Oh, it's a Star of David.
1185000	1186000	It's a juicicle.
1186000	1187000	Why?
1187000	1188000	It's a juicicle.
1188000	1190000	It's like a Captain America juicicle.
1190000	1191000	It's a juicicle.
1191000	1193000	What's a juicicle?
1193000	1198000	It's a frozen treat that comes out around Ramadan.
1198000	1201000	But it's kosher.
1201000	1206000	It's like a pentacle, but it's Jew because it's a Star of David.
1206000	1209000	Is it actually, is that a functioning tire for your bike?
1209000	1210000	Is it a cup holder on it?
1210000	1212000	A motorized juicicle?
1212000	1213000	Is it a unicycle?
1213000	1214000	Where's the rest of the unicycle?
1214000	1216000	Couldn't he leave it at home?
1216000	1220000	How would he have gotten here if he'd left it at home?
1220000	1223000	Also, how many balls do you have calling that out?
1223000	1225000	I saw a guy holding a big metal round thing in his lap,
1225000	1228000	and I was like, what if he stood up and that's how he breathes?
1228000	1233000	The guy was like, leave that alone.
1233000	1238000	The guy's got equipment.
1238000	1239000	There's no room.
1239000	1241000	You got to stand.
1241000	1243000	It's a standing unicycle.
1243000	1245000	That's why it's cheaper.
1245000	1246000	Can you, yeah.
1246000	1247000	No, no.
1247000	1248000	There's no way.
1248000	1252000	What are you talking about?
1252000	1254000	All right.
1255000	1258000	This is...
1258000	1260000	All right.
1267000	1269000	All right.
1273000	1275000	This is a terrible idea.
1275000	1277000	I'm very nervous right now.
1277000	1280000	The front row is so upset about this.
1280000	1281000	It's a joke.
1281000	1282000	It's a joke.
1282000	1283000	It doesn't actually work.
1283000	1284000	Oh, my God.
1284000	1285000	Oh, my God.
1285000	1286000	Oh, my God.
1286000	1287000	Oh, my God.
1287000	1288000	Oh.
1288000	1289000	Whoa.
1289000	1290000	You did it.
1290000	1292000	Best podcast ever.
1296000	1298000	I have a question.
1298000	1300000	Nick in his magical juicicle.
1300000	1303000	That was amazing.
1303000	1305000	I have a question.
1305000	1306000	I have two questions.
1306000	1309000	I have a thousand questions.
1309000	1311000	Are you Jewish?
1311000	1314000	I'm 63.125.
1315000	1318000	That's such a Jew answer.
1319000	1321000	I assume.
1321000	1324000	Our next guest is my insurance agent.
1324000	1327000	By the way, that would have easily...
1327000	1329000	Eight people could have sued us.
1329000	1333000	What I'm blown away by is the engineering of that.
1333000	1334000	How does that work?
1334000	1335000	That's so cool.
1335000	1338000	Well, upon first viewing, that looks like an impossible feat
1338000	1339000	that you just did.
1340000	1342000	So the pedals just spin.
1342000	1345000	I thought for a minute, the inside, the rim, if you will,
1345000	1347000	spun independently of the wheel.
1347000	1348000	I was like, that doesn't make any sense.
1348000	1349000	Does the Star of David...
1349000	1351000	Is that an important functional piece,
1351000	1353000	or is that just for design purposes?
1353000	1354000	It's structural.
1354000	1356000	It's structurally very sound.
1356000	1358000	Is it called a junicycle?
1359000	1361000	Did he say that was what it was called?
1361000	1362000	A Jew cycle.
1362000	1363000	Isn't that what he said?
1363000	1364000	Oh, I can't...
1364000	1365000	He said Jew cycle.
1365000	1366000	Sorry, sorry.
1366000	1367000	I got it mixed up.
1367000	1369000	Do you walk faster than you can do that?
1370000	1371000	What's faster?
1373000	1375000	You don't know?
1375000	1378000	That's not a more efficient way to get around?
1379000	1382000	Nick, try walking, and then you don't have to carry that thing around.
1384000	1387000	Nick, I'm assuming it's a lot harder than riding a regular unicycle with a seat, right?
1392000	1393000	Six weeks, okay.
1393000	1394000	But you'd already learned how to ride a regular unicycle.
1394000	1395000	So, yes.
1395000	1396000	Let's not start from scratch.
1397000	1398000	That's right.
1398000	1399000	If you just learn...
1399000	1400000	If you pick that up first, I think that would be...
1400000	1401000	I have a question.
1401000	1402000	Why?
1404000	1405000	Are you like a performer?
1405000	1406000	I'm serious question.
1406000	1407000	Are you like a performer,
1407000	1408000	or is it just like you were like,
1408000	1409000	oh, I want to do this?
1413000	1415000	I learned how to ride a unicycle,
1415000	1417000	and I got bored with it,
1417000	1419000	and then I found this on YouTube,
1419000	1421000	and I said, I want to do that.
1421000	1422000	I want to try it.
1422000	1423000	That makes sense.
1423000	1424000	Not here.
1424000	1426000	Not on the stage, but I want to try it.
1426000	1428000	But isn't there like a chain
1428000	1431000	that you can lock it up outside?
1432000	1435000	I like that he's assuming people are going to steal it.
1436000	1438000	Well, I mean, you can't just leave it laying out.
1438000	1440000	Someone would steal it, but I guess...
1440000	1442000	Nick, do you want to set it down up here?
1442000	1446000	Yeah, you can put it up there for the sake of your neighbors.
1448000	1451000	Yeah, just the streets of Los Angeles are on that thing.
1452000	1453000	All right.
1455000	1457000	Jeff just left with it.
1458000	1459000	I said it's been stolen.
1459000	1462000	So that proves the theory right there.
1462000	1465000	Tyler, tell us about your show, Deadbeat.
1466000	1468000	That's a nice natural segue.
1470000	1471000	I can't stop thinking.
1471000	1473000	I thought that was like a Captain America shield.
1473000	1475000	I thought you were sitting there holding like a shield,
1475000	1477000	but just got it like really wrong.
1477000	1478000	When it lifted up.
1478000	1479000	When it lifted up.
1479000	1482000	But then all I saw was a little bit of steel and rubber.
1482000	1486000	And then I just assumed like that may be holding that man's body together.
1486000	1487000	You thought that was...
1487000	1489000	And Shrobs was like, what's with that shit?
1490000	1491000	I was like, oh man.
1491000	1495000	I did have like a half second of...
1495000	1498000	It might be a collapsible wheelchair.
1499000	1501000	This could go badly, but...
1501000	1502000	A touchy subject.
1502000	1504000	Anyways, Deadbeat.
1504000	1505000	Yes, Deadbeat.
1505000	1507000	I can't seem to make myself talk about this show.
1508000	1510000	My boss is in the audience too.
1510000	1511000	Your girlfriend.
1511000	1512000	Yeah.
1512000	1513000	I should probably talk about it.
1513000	1514000	Yeah.
1514000	1515000	It's the third season.
1515000	1516000	I think you covered a lot of it.
1516000	1517000	I play a...
1517000	1518000	I hold a ghost balloon.
1518000	1520000	I hold a balloon a lot.
1521000	1523000	There's a lot of yellow in the show.
1524000	1526000	Is balloon actually a part of it?
1526000	1528000	Oh, balloon's a big part of the show.
1528000	1530000	Yeah, balloon's a big part of the show.
1530000	1531000	I mean, at least for the first like season.
1531000	1533000	And then people realize that balloon was nice.
1533000	1534000	It always seemed to me...
1534000	1535000	Super.
1535000	1537000	Because you and the balloon are kind of like a Sam and Diane kind of thing.
1537000	1538000	Like a will they, won't they?
1538000	1539000	Yeah.
1539000	1540000	Will they, won't they?
1540000	1541000	It's like a are they or aren't they?
1541000	1542000	You know?
1542000	1544000	Will they, won't they?
1544000	1547000	It always seemed to me when I was driving by those billboards,
1547000	1549000	when I knew what the show was that I would look at the key art,
1549000	1555000	I would go, okay, somebody at Hulu decided that they didn't want the show to be perceived
1555000	1560000	as like a nerdy show because it's really about a guy who can see ghosts
1560000	1562000	and who helps them finish their business.
1562000	1563000	That's what the show does.
1563000	1564000	But he kind of helped himself.
1564000	1565000	That's what you do with a balloon, honestly.
1565000	1569000	And so then the key art seems to be like engineered to like be like,
1569000	1571000	yeah, but it's about people too.
1571000	1572000	Yeah.
1572000	1575000	And I think they put somebody in like, you know, R&D was like,
1575000	1579000	and yellow makes people think happy thoughts and it also makes them hungry.
1579000	1580000	So we should use yellow.
1580000	1581000	What's that?
1581000	1582000	Is it a drama or a comedy?
1582000	1583000	It's a comedy.
1583000	1584000	It's a comedy.
1584000	1586000	It literally has nothing to do with balloons.
1586000	1587000	It has nothing to do with it.
1587000	1588000	No.
1588000	1589000	Well, what is it?
1589000	1592000	It's a good pitch for a show, which the key art never really made clear,
1592000	1597000	which is that it's a dude who can see ghosts, but he's a loser.
1597000	1598000	I'm a total fucking loser.
1598000	1600000	Oh, so it's drug addicts.
1600000	1601000	He can't help himself.
1601000	1602000	Yeah.
1602000	1603000	Yeah.
1603000	1605000	Your first instinct was right.
1605000	1606000	Yeah.
1606000	1607000	Okay.
1607000	1609000	No, he can't help himself.
1609000	1612000	But do you?
1612000	1614000	And helping the ghosts.
1614000	1618000	I can help them, but I can't help myself.
1618000	1621000	You can't help yourself helping them?
1621000	1624000	No, I think you're hung up on that.
1624000	1625000	Okay.
1625000	1626000	I really am.
1626000	1627000	Yeah.
1627000	1629000	Now it's become less about the emphasis.
1629000	1630000	So you're a loser.
1630000	1633000	You can't help yourself, but you can help these ghosts.
1633000	1634000	Yeah.
1634000	1636000	I can help other people, but I don't know how to make my own life work.
1636000	1637000	Okay.
1637000	1638000	If that makes sense.
1638000	1642000	But here are some reasons to watch the show, even though it's already been on for nine
1642000	1643000	seasons.
1643000	1644000	Yeah.
1644000	1646000	You're going out your tenth season now, right?
1646000	1647000	Yeah.
1647000	1648000	The eleventh season's coming out.
1648000	1653000	Um, I was just at the premiere of, uh, well, and you showed episode three 11, which, uh,
1653000	1658000	you know, they're all dropping at the same time on four 20 mnemonic device.
1658000	1659000	Check it out.
1659000	1660000	Four 20.
1660000	1663000	I saw the, it was the larping one that you guys did.
1663000	1664000	It was very cohesive.
1664000	1670000	I have that from, from talking to, uh, my lover who, uh, helped create the show and her
1670000	1675000	like insights of like, Oh, there's like, you know, this fact is serialized in this.
1675000	1677880	I was like, Oh, I'm not going to understand like dropping into the thing.
1677880	1679880	There's a, it's a, that's a nice little episode.
1679880	1680880	Yeah.
1680880	1683880	That's why they put it on the, the, uh, the, the premiere at the premiere.
1683880	1686880	Cause they were afraid there'd be new viewers at the premiere.
1686880	1688880	They'd be judging it like, fuck this.
1688880	1689880	I don't get it.
1689880	1690880	I end up here.
1690880	1691880	They knew I was coming.
1691880	1700400	But yeah, we, we, we, we, uh, we lampoon pretty much every like, um, uh, style of film.
1700400	1702360	And we, you know, we did the larping thing.
1702360	1705080	We did like a, we did like a Royal Thomas crown affair.
1705680	1707160	I almost said crown Royal affair.
1707800	1711160	Uh, uh, we do like a fight club one.
1715040	1720400	Who said tight site velvet, nice, tight velvet bag, bro.
1721120	1726200	He raised his hand like with devil horn, which is the least surprising thing for
1726200	1730560	a guy who just yelled tight to do and then take a bow on brand.
1731520	1735880	That guy is holding it like a, a, a, a giant tall boy to Katae right there.
1735880	1736880	Perfect.
1738000	1739000	You're not, what is that?
1743080	1744080	It's a straga Rita.
1746120	1747000	Um, yeah.
1747000	1748120	So that's basically the show.
1748120	1751400	It's like, I feel like you guys know being there, Peter Sellers.
1751400	1755960	Like, yeah, that was what I, I know Cody had a different inspiration for the
1755960	1759480	show, but I always like to liken the character to a Chauncey, Chauncey
1759480	1760720	gardener, Chance, the gardener.
1760720	1764960	He's just an idiot who was failing upwards and, uh, can't, can't help himself.
1764960	1765800	I have a question.
1766800	1768800	Are there a different ghost each episode?
1768800	1771200	Or are there this, you have like a crew of ghosts that you're friends with?
1771200	1772160	It's like a ghost of the week.
1772160	1776720	And we have one, we did have one ghost that fought through which was sort of the
1776720	1782240	balloon, I guess, if it had to be, do you have like, is there like a underwater
1782240	1788280	ghost or there's like a ghost, like bull or something like that.
1788720	1793080	And there's like, you know, people like dead, like normal, like dead, like a mummy,
1793080	1794560	but it's a ghost mummy.
1794560	1799000	It's a guy who is good, is wrapped up with bandages and he just suffocated.
1799000	1800880	So he came back as a Tyler Tyler.
1801080	1801480	Keep going.
1801480	1802120	You're getting close.
1802120	1803320	Rob is unemployed right now.
1803320	1805640	He's trying to, he's trying to pitch himself as a director.
1805640	1807360	He's trying to get some shit going.
1808840	1809960	So this is a fantasy of yours.
1809960	1811240	You want to play a ghost mummy on a?
1812320	1812680	Yeah.
1812680	1813880	I want to watch it.
1814360	1815360	Oh, you want to watch it.
1815360	1815640	Okay.
1815640	1816520	I don't really.
1817400	1819520	How long are the people who are ghosts?
1819520	1820560	How long have they been dead?
1820560	1821800	Are they like a recent?
1821800	1823400	Or is it also like from 1800s?
1823400	1825000	It's like dinosaurs.
1825000	1826560	Are there, there we go.
1826560	1830440	It's P I was just keep it to people, Tyler, but the people, I don't know.
1830440	1830800	Yeah.
1830800	1836800	Well, I mean, there's a good episode, a ghost dinosaur.
1836800	1837400	Yeah.
1838000	1838440	Yeah.
1838840	1842360	Are you guys, you know, a whole like language barrier thing would come up, you
1842360	1845920	know, misunderstandings all over the place.
1845920	1846920	It could be cuckoo.
1847040	1850120	What business would a good dinosaur need to finish?
1850720	1851280	Yeah, I don't know.
1851280	1853160	That would be possible.
1853160	1853440	Yeah.
1853440	1856800	There would be ghost dinosaurs everywhere because they all, they never.
1856840	1857200	Yeah.
1857200	1858400	We had a fucking meteor hit.
1858400	1859880	They were like, what is this?
1859880	1861520	They were kind of like, maybe were they stuck around?
1861520	1864400	Cause he was like, you kind of need you to help us like solve this whole
1864400	1865240	extinction thing.
1865280	1865600	Yeah.
1865800	1866720	Could you go back and help us?
1866720	1868400	Every episode that would be like, you're static.
1868400	1869920	You'd be like, are you a fucking dinosaur?
1869960	1871280	You died in a meteor.
1871320	1871480	Yeah.
1871480	1874560	And then word would get out and then every creature ever would come back to me.
1874600	1877760	They're the meteor revenge.
1878000	1879760	Oh, we do have a meteor after the meteor.
1880120	1881440	They hate meteors.
1881440	1881680	Yeah.
1881920	1883520	Tyler, Tyler, you were like a drink.
1883520	1885200	Do you fuck a minute?
1885200	1886680	My doctor told me not to drink anymore.
1886680	1887840	After Wednesday night.
1888200	1889080	This is a true story.
1889120	1889720	What happened?
1889800	1890840	I just exploded.
1890840	1892400	My whole insides exploded.
1893120	1894480	What kind of doctor do you have?
1894480	1898880	If that's the diagnosis he's giving you, are you a ghost?
1898960	1899960	Yeah, basically.
1900800	1902080	Hey, he helped himself.
1902080	1902840	I have a little time.
1903360	1904400	He helped himself.
1905320	1908960	Is that why the billboard doesn't, it's just you in a balloon because you're the
1908960	1909440	ghost.
1909440	1909800	Yeah.
1909840	1910200	Yeah.
1910200	1910880	Finally.
1912880	1914200	You guys finally got it.
1914280	1914800	You got it.
1915400	1916600	Short, short answer is no.
1916600	1917120	Thank you, Dan.
1917120	1917520	I'm okay.
1918200	1920280	Whoa, right through.
1920640	1924160	Whoa, whoa.
1924360	1925240	But you're touching me.
1925240	1925840	You're physically touching.
1925840	1926440	No, I didn't.
1926440	1926880	That kind.
1926880	1927560	You're a ghost.
1927560	1930160	What happened with the, what happened on Wednesday night drinking?
1930240	1931520	The doctor in the Wednesday.
1931560	1932160	Oh, nothing.
1932160	1935880	I just drank a lot on Wednesday night and I've been having, I've been having a lot
1935880	1944040	of gastrointestinal issues, guys, a lot of diarrhea, a lot of unexplained sounds and
1944040	1944520	pains.
1944520	1947600	And I just been like drinking my way through it, which my wife thinks is a bad
1947600	1947880	idea.
1947880	1949280	And then my doctor does.
1949280	1952880	I saw you at the premiere and I was drinking a lot and you were like, I can't wait to
1952880	1953920	come drink on the show.
1953920	1955760	I was like, going to bring you a bottle of booze and everything.
1955760	1957320	And I was like, there's booze there.
1957320	1959200	And you were like, yeah, but there won't be enough.
1959200	1964240	And then something, and then we split up and then you walked into the spinning
1964240	1969200	propeller of a plane and I died.
1969200	1969760	And now I'm here.
1971520	1971840	Yeah.
1971840	1974520	No, I basically, my doctor, this is so stupid.
1974520	1975280	Why am I fucking now?
1975280	1975960	This is important.
1975960	1976600	Are you kidding me?
1976600	1980800	This is right now, but I was moments ago.
1982000	1984560	There are issues going on with me and my guts.
1984720	1986120	We are yet to be determined.
1986120	1987360	How long have you had these?
1987360	1988120	It's about three months.
1988560	1990360	We finished shooting season three of deadbeat.
1990360	1994000	I almost killed myself in New York with the food, but it's just lots of food and
1994000	1994480	alcohol.
1995000	1997120	And, uh, because that's what they pay you at Hulu.
1997160	1997440	Yeah.
1997440	2000880	They pay, they're like, here's more crackers.
2000920	2001080	Yeah.
2001080	2001760	Here's some more crackers.
2001760	2006000	And here's some, at least they give me some Tito's once in a while, but I, uh, I
2006000	2010600	got, uh, I got some, uh, uh, sort of elimination diet thing going on in my
2010600	2013800	doctor said, why don't we, why don't we just start with alcohol, start with alcohol
2013800	2014760	and see where we go from there.
2014760	2016320	And then it'll be like, Oh, now it's bananas.
2016320	2017200	And now it's avocado.
2017200	2019720	And now it's, man, I would start with bananas.
2019760	2020160	I know.
2020160	2020440	Right.
2021920	2022760	He got me worried though.
2022760	2024200	This is a Western medicine doctor.
2024200	2026960	I think I should go to see some like on purpose.
2026960	2028880	I should go see some really hokey wacky.
2028880	2032920	It's just an easy thing to eliminate first is the thing you drink for fun.
2033240	2036880	Like I would be like, eliminate every fucking thing until then, because that's
2036880	2040920	my toehold, because once you eliminate that, I'm like, I'm dead.
2042280	2046400	Like eliminate avocado, eliminate toast, eliminate church.
2046480	2049000	But I'm thinking, I'm thinking, I'm thinking long game.
2049000	2051600	I'm thinking like, I don't want to have to eliminate booze forever.
2052080	2055800	So if I eliminate it now and figure out some shit, maybe I can drink in like a
2055800	2058400	month rather than just keep drinking through and they're like, well, you were
2058400	2060600	fine a month ago and then you drank a hole in your guts.
2060640	2061520	Yeah, I don't know.
2061520	2062080	You can't do it.
2062080	2066200	I, I had some serious intestinal problems, but they cleared up right after I
2066200	2067200	stopped going to church.
2067200	2070680	So, oh yeah, I would definitely try it.
2070680	2072080	So maybe I should start with church.
2072080	2073520	Maybe I should start with giving up church.
2074400	2077040	That's why I've never had gastrointestinal problems.
2078520	2079600	Must be nice.
2080080	2081080	Muslim privilege.
2082720	2084400	Hashtag third world problems.
2086640	2087840	What did we turn the tables?
2088120	2089080	Third world problems.
2089960	2090800	Oh, great.
2091200	2091400	Yeah.
2091400	2092400	I don't know where you're going with that.
2092400	2093480	Eating rust from a bowl again.
2096400	2098680	Camille, what have you been up to superstar?
2098960	2100440	Can we talk about your project?
2100440	2101760	The, or is that a secret?
2101800	2103120	You know, what project?
2104160	2106280	No, we can talk about it.
2109000	2109400	Oh yeah.
2109440	2113520	Well, uh, Silicon Valley comes back April 24th and that's going to be great.
2114280	2116360	That's going to be great.
2118200	2121680	And then I think we, I mentioned the movie here once before, right?
2121720	2123880	My, Emily doesn't pay attention.
2124200	2126560	Yeah, he doesn't pay attention.
2128680	2130640	Um, all right.
2131360	2132760	Emily and I wrote a movie.
2132760	2135200	Your vine is louder than his bread.
2141840	2146880	Since you eliminated alcohol, have you experienced any relief from your symptoms?
2146920	2148320	You mean in the last two days?
2149320	2150160	I'm trying to help you.
2150160	2151120	Don't fucking turn on it.
2152440	2153320	No, I haven't.
2153320	2153840	I haven't.
2154040	2156840	Uh, I, I, well, it's been four, what's today?
2156840	2157240	Sunday.
2157240	2158320	I never know what day of the week it is.
2158320	2158520	Yeah.
2158520	2158920	Sunday.
2158920	2160120	So you last drank Wednesday.
2160200	2164400	On Wednesday, I had about two days of real excruciating stomach pain.
2164400	2166960	That that's why I stopped because I was in, I couldn't stand up.
2167000	2168080	It gets like ulcers.
2168080	2168360	Yeah.
2168360	2169880	It might be all sort of colitis assumption.
2169880	2174160	I don't know what it is, but all I know is that after that drinking and there was
2174160	2176920	like two nights of drinking before that, that did set me off.
2177520	2177800	Yeah.
2177880	2179000	What do you, what do you drink?
2179000	2184600	I just drink like double vodka on the rocks, which may have also something to do with.
2191040	2194160	Oh, is that your drink too?
2194160	2200240	Is that Dan wanted to hear you say anything other than that answer?
2202080	2204280	It's the best drink on the face of the planet.
2204280	2207840	I mean, just vodka and ice is like, and you got to drink it before the ice melts.
2208240	2211400	Uh, cause otherwise you get watery booze and then you drink, you know, yeah.
2211400	2212160	It goes, it's good.
2212160	2212360	Yeah.
2212360	2214280	You don't want to drink any water by mistake.
2214280	2219240	No, no, no, no, not at all.
2220600	2221840	You don't know what's in that shit.
2221840	2222600	You don't know what they put in that shit.
2222600	2223960	It's a race against time.
2226200	2226920	And I always win.
2226920	2228000	I win that race usually.
2230840	2232800	Dan was hoping you were going to say margaritas.
2235440	2236880	Or, or vitamin water.
2239200	2239520	I don't know.
2239520	2241040	Moon juice or pick a lot of moon juice.
2241280	2246040	I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm resigned to the fact that we, each of us are snowflakes and we
2246040	2249720	don't, you know, we don't, I mean, I'm not like, I, my,
2249720	2254920	my big fear is like, uh, you know, when people like, uh, they're obituaries
2254920	2258520	happen and then everybody's like, uh, I guess that's my way of saying they die.
2258840	2262640	Uh, you know, they're obituaries happen.
2262680	2265720	Oh my God, there's no, there's no recipe for, for death.
2265880	2267480	These were, you know, we were just talking about this.
2267480	2269520	Well, Brittany, Brittany, Brittany Murphy.
2269520	2275320	Remember when her obituary happened, she died, she died and it was like, oh,
2275320	2278640	her lifestyle and she did this and she didn't eat and she not only put
2278640	2283520	her butts on her heads and whatever, like everyone just sounded off on how she
2283520	2289160	died and then moved on and then her husband died and it was because their
2289160	2291240	fucking shower had mold in it.
2291600	2295400	And it was like, like me, is that really what it was?
2295440	2295600	Yeah.
2295600	2296560	Black mold, man.
2296560	2297120	It'll kill you.
2297120	2300800	But it was like, it was like, no joke, like, like, I don't know what the point
2300800	2304440	of that fable is, but it's like, fuck, you know, when people die, just fucking
2304440	2308080	say it's tragic or when people go out of their way their whole life to be the
2308080	2311400	most healthy, like obnoxiously healthy and then they fucking drop dead in the
2311400	2311600	gym.
2311600	2313720	You know, there's no, we have, there is no plan.
2313720	2318480	If we figured it out, there would be a very noticeable disparity between doctor
2318480	2320360	lifespans and patient lifespans.
2321000	2322240	It never happens.
2322440	2326680	We've spent all this money going to these guys that are doctors or ladies.
2327800	2332320	Doctors can be like, guys is unisex, guys is unisex, but it's all their
2332320	2335480	lifespans are random, you know, like they're like, you should eat more peanuts.
2335480	2336760	So like, well, what do you do?
2336760	2338560	You're going to die randomly too.
2339320	2341320	Yeah, that's the point.
2341320	2342720	That was the whole point in a nutshell.
2343080	2344520	I think you're going to die randomly.
2344520	2347080	I've met more old doctors and comedians.
2350080	2351160	It's an astute observation.
2351160	2351800	I think that's fair.
2351840	2354760	That's because as a comedian, you're constantly going to the doctor.
2357160	2357600	All right.
2358040	2358560	Fair enough.
2361720	2362720	I don't know, man.
2362840	2364360	No, that would be noticeable.
2364360	2368680	People be like, Tyler just told you that drinking double vodka is killing him.
2368920	2369080	Yeah.
2369080	2370920	But what he's saying is, is that's killing me.
2370960	2372440	That doesn't mean it's going to kill him.
2372440	2373920	Maybe it's random.
2373920	2375920	Maybe that's not the same time as me.
2376040	2379280	I don't want anybody out there thinking that this is some sort of fucking PSA
2379280	2380520	for not drinking vodka.
2381000	2383000	Drink vodka, drink vodka, man.
2383000	2386920	I wish I could drink vodka with you right now until your stomach bleeds and then
2386920	2391000	stop and then be like, is there some way to retroactively fix this?
2391000	2394280	Like put a band-aid on it and then start drinking again as soon as
2394280	2394600	possible.
2394600	2396520	Ron Funches did a great minds.
2396520	2398000	He's allergic to alcohol.
2398000	2399560	I was like, oh, like allergic to alcohol.
2399560	2401000	Like you drink it, then you get really drunk.
2401200	2402280	No, allergic to alcohol.
2402280	2404080	Like if Ron Funches takes a drink.
2404440	2405240	Canaphylactic?
2405280	2405600	Yeah.
2405800	2407120	His throat closes up.
2407360	2409440	I was like, can you imagine being a high schooler?
2410240	2413240	Like, Oh, no, I don't want to, I'm allergic to it.
2413240	2413400	Yeah.
2413400	2414200	Fuck you, pussy.
2414200	2417520	And like, like, I bet you he found himself on the floor of a lot of parties.
2417520	2419400	I'm like, Oh, shame, shame, shame.
2419400	2420840	Like we're not all the same.
2421040	2422160	Shame, shame, shame.
2422280	2423240	We're not all the same.
2425280	2427800	I just had an image of him, like, succumbing to peer pressure.
2428000	2429320	Like, drink, drink, drink.
2429320	2431800	And he's like, all right, let me get my EpiPen.
2432240	2432760	Yeah.
2433760	2434000	Yeah.
2434000	2435680	I mean, that's like the eye orange for this guy.
2435880	2436280	I don't know.
2436280	2440760	Like I, I, I, I smoked some weed and I start checking my pulse and freaking out.
2440760	2442880	I'm like, oh, the angels are talking to me.
2442880	2443240	Yeah.
2443320	2447920	And then Spencer's like, like, you know, eats a brick of hash for this breakfast
2447920	2450800	and to keep his hands steady.
2455280	2461120	Oh, no, that's fresh ice that I poured for the next person.
2461120	2461800	You can use that.
2462320	2463320	That's so thoughtful.
2466360	2466880	Keep talking.
2466920	2467880	No, I'll tell you that.
2467880	2471680	And of course, Jeff is a slave to you guys flinging Craven on me.
2475480	2477040	I don't know what that Craven thing.
2477040	2479080	Decent, decent pour, decent pour.
2480080	2481360	You are, you haven't drank.
2482360	2484280	You haven't had to drink in two days, right?
2484600	2485240	Four days.
2485240	2485680	No, I'm okay.
2485680	2485960	Thank you.
2486360	2486640	Yeah.
2487720	2490560	But I, I go through, I go through bouts of not drinking often.
2490560	2494800	I have two small children and a third one on the way and thank you.
2495360	2498720	And I find that it's not, it's not so much that it's the drinking.
2498720	2499640	It's the recovery.
2499640	2500600	And your kids drink.
2500760	2501040	Yeah.
2501040	2505760	They drink like somebody's got to stay in control.
2505760	2507200	Someone's got to be lucid, you know?
2507240	2507640	Yeah.
2507920	2509800	No, the morning, the morning, the five 15.
2510240	2513360	Driver these days, how old are you kids?
2513520	2517600	I have a five year old girl, a two and a half year old boy and a 10 and a half
2517600	2518960	week old that one's a ghost.
2518960	2519840	That one's a ghost.
2519960	2520640	That one's a ghost.
2520640	2521360	That one's a ghost.
2521360	2521560	Yeah.
2521560	2522480	No spoilers.
2522760	2524320	Inspired by ghost balloon.
2526960	2528120	His third kid's a balloon.
2530440	2531720	You have three children.
2532000	2535000	No, two with the third is so, so tiny.
2535000	2536560	I shouldn't even be talking about it now.
2536560	2538080	Third is imminent.
2538480	2541080	Well, no, it's like, it's, it's, it's literally, it's a 10 and a half
2541080	2541920	week old fetus.
2542680	2542920	Yeah.
2542920	2544320	I don't think I told my mom yet.
2544360	2545280	I don't think my mom knows yet.
2546280	2548120	Maybe she listens to harmontown.
2549120	2550640	Does your mom listen to harmontown?
2550680	2551080	Yeah.
2551080	2551400	Yeah.
2551400	2552000	She's a big fan.
2552000	2552960	This is, this is the plan.
2552960	2553640	This is why I'm here.
2553920	2554240	Yeah.
2554560	2555040	Mom.
2555040	2556120	Good news.
2556280	2557360	Having a third baby.
2558200	2561080	Are you, uh, are you Catholic?
2561760	2562440	No, I'm nothing.
2562440	2564880	I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm literally, some people want children.
2565560	2569320	I, you know, it is, is I'm, I, I really, I really liked the feeling of
2569320	2570440	coming in my wife.
2573320	2574240	That called me crazy.
2574240	2574760	I don't know.
2574760	2575640	I just like it.
2575680	2577080	I was willing to throw it all.
2577440	2578640	You don't want to wait for that one.
2578640	2584520	Just, and she, and she's like, well, oh God, here he goes again.
2585720	2588080	That makes two of us, Taylor, right?
2588080	2593840	So, oh, oh, you mean coming in my wife, I guess.
2594280	2597440	I'm just saying if your third child comes out wearing a suit,
2599440	2600640	I know who to call.
2600640	2603600	We'll wait till that, again, put a pin in that, we'll put a pin in that.
2603600	2609600	The slogan of this podcast is he comes in his wife and we can't help ourselves.
2612040	2615280	Which is, it's, you read it the right way.
2615280	2615880	It's the right way.
2615880	2616400	It's the right way.
2616400	2616920	It's the right way.
2616920	2617440	It's the right way.
2617440	2618160	All of us works better for that.
2618160	2621280	I get out of his wife, can't help himself.
2621760	2626640	Can't help himself comes in his life, comes in his wife.
2626640	2628280	He can't help himself though.
2628880	2630480	He can't, he comes in his wife.
2630480	2631800	Can't come in himself.
2633360	2634040	That's not true though.
2634040	2637920	I mean, I could, you can get out to get your wrist going.
2638640	2638800	Yeah.
2638800	2639200	There's a thing.
2639200	2642280	I think it's called like retrograde ejaculation where you just
2642280	2643360	come up inside your bladder.
2643400	2643880	Oh yeah.
2643880	2644560	That's no good.
2644840	2645400	It hasn't happened.
2645400	2646080	Everybody in here.
2647880	2649800	It's not like a choice you make as you're coming.
2650240	2652040	And then it goes inside.
2652280	2652840	I don't know.
2652840	2654360	I just thought you choose.
2654360	2655360	Or is that a condition?
2655360	2656600	I just read, I just read about it.
2656600	2658440	I know, I know as much about it as you do.
2658440	2660680	You yell inside in Latin as you're coming.
2660720	2662360	You just come inside yourself.
2662400	2662920	I don't know.
2663040	2665840	I just thought it was something that everybody had experienced at one point.
2666800	2669320	Every time I've come, I've come outside.
2669760	2669920	Yeah.
2669920	2671440	That's why it's called retrograde.
2671480	2673640	I've never had like reverse orgasms.
2673680	2674560	Well, let me tell you something.
2675320	2676680	It feels horrible.
2676680	2680400	What are you talking about when you pinch the, yeah.
2680600	2683640	No, I, I, the only reason I actually know this is because Dr.
2683640	2686600	Drew Pinsky explained it to me once on Love Line.
2686640	2687840	Apparently what happens is.
2687880	2691040	Did he explain it to you or was it on the radio and you heard it?
2691400	2691680	Yeah.
2691680	2692680	Well, I was on his show.
2692680	2692880	You were.
2692880	2693360	Oh, okay.
2693360	2694040	It was on Love Line.
2694040	2694960	It was in the green room.
2695280	2695520	Yeah.
2696120	2696640	Split the difference.
2696640	2696840	You share it.
2696840	2697360	Let's bring him out.
2697360	2698200	He can explain it to you.
2699040	2699280	Dr.
2699280	2699720	Drew, come on.
2700240	2704480	Uh, I think it's, it's one of those things where you, if you, if you, if you, uh, try
2704480	2710080	to stop the E-Jack for too long, yeah, with this technique that this is my theory, not
2710080	2710400	do it.
2710400	2714400	And I guess it can eventually, uh, cause it doesn't go back up inside of your nuts.
2714960	2718400	It goes back up your urethra and parts that it can end up in your bladder.
2718400	2719680	And then why are you stopping it?
2719680	2719800	What?
2719800	2722520	You pee out your, your, because you want to fuck longer.
2722720	2722880	Yeah.
2722880	2724880	Are you like people call it is something called edging?
2724880	2727080	I think where you just keep fucking there almost there.
2727240	2727720	Never heard of it.
2727720	2727920	Yeah.
2729840	2731200	Well, there's a thing called edging.
2733320	2733680	Yeah.
2733680	2734120	Yeah.
2734680	2743240	Now, for, for the Harman town listeners that have not paid $5 a month to see the live
2743240	2746640	stream, Tyler was currently edging Rob Schwab right now.
2748760	2750120	Only $5 a month.
2750120	2751040	You get to see.
2751240	2752200	So, so what are you doing?
2752200	2753760	He's getting an education.
2755520	2755760	All right.
2757560	2758920	Don't have a vodka.
2759160	2759560	Have a.
2762000	2763360	No, no word plan.
2763360	2764200	No sports.
2764200	2764840	That was great.
2764840	2765240	Sorry.
2765240	2767040	I only have two rules.
2769280	2774280	But wait, I want to talk about this obviously that the, uh, but when you're, when you're
2774280	2779920	talking about not wanting to orgasm for a while, you're not, that's different from pinching
2779920	2780640	the tip.
2780680	2782200	No, but they're not, it's not pinching.
2782200	2783240	It's like whole, right?
2783240	2786960	It's like, it's not literally like you, it has already happened and you're, it's at the
2786960	2788160	tip and you're just stopping it.
2788440	2789720	That would just eventually come out.
2789720	2792720	I think it's like, it's like, it's like the active.
2792840	2798720	Uh, it's the act of actively going to circumvent ejaculation.
2799520	2803000	If you do that long enough, you can come inside like thinking about, I know you hate this,
2803000	2807440	but like, you know, when people think about baseball, when they're fucking do not come,
2807480	2812560	it's like that red light, green light, red light, green light.
2814920	2819880	Like if you're about to come and go red light, and then you stop, then you come inside you.
2820240	2825440	If you read like too many times, Tyler, you start going the wrong way.
2825480	2829720	I genuinely feel like I still want to open this up to the, to the crowd and, and have
2829720	2833640	other people talking about their experiences with, with back to the brain ejaculation.
2833640	2837360	And you, you're saying you have felt the, the repercussions of that?
2837400	2838560	No, I've never had it happen to me.
2838560	2839760	I've had it explained to me.
2839840	2842120	Is this a wives' tale or a husband's tale or a thing?
2842160	2843840	It's a Dr. Drew Pinsky tale.
2844080	2846280	It's a, it's a, and if he says it, it's got to be true.
2846280	2847480	I think it's a thing that happens.
2847640	2850360	What would be the worst possible scenario that that?
2850800	2851440	I don't know.
2851440	2853280	I'm not like an expert on this.
2853280	2857640	I just think, I think if you, I mean, if you imagine infection or like, yeah, kind of
2857640	2858600	sepsis or something.
2858600	2858800	Yeah.
2858800	2864480	You go, there is, well, look, I, like what I've read about this is that there are, there
2864480	2865480	are, he's read about it too.
2866200	2873640	See, my friends who are into the idea of you actually physically like restrain the
2873680	2875160	actual emission.
2875200	2875640	All right.
2875720	2877480	It's called the Dr. Drew Pinsky.
2877960	2881040	Oh, I guess that's going to show.
2881040	2882840	Thank you for coming to Harman town, everybody.
2884280	2884880	Dry fast.
2884880	2885400	Take a chance.
2885560	2886160	I don't like it.
2886160	2887240	I don't like wordplay.
2890680	2892960	He doesn't like it because if he thought of it, he would have said it.
2893000	2893840	That's not true.
2894520	2895440	That's not true.
2895840	2896400	So true.
2896840	2900600	I'm, I'm, I'm thinking of a thousand puns a minute and just rejecting them.
2901280	2901920	Give us one.
2901920	2902720	You reject it.
2905800	2906400	That's a good one.
2906400	2907040	That's a good pun.
2907040	2907520	I like that one.
2910200	2914600	Well, why are you judging me with your microphone?
2915040	2926360	That seems like a J a judge, judge, judge, like a judge, like a judge a phone.
2926400	2927080	We'll be right back.
2927280	2927960	We'll be right back.
2929040	2932800	It doesn't take that much time out for station identification.
2932840	2933240	Go ahead.
2933880	2935200	Childish nonsense.
2935200	2937280	What were you saying about the pinching sit there?
2937280	2938480	Let's go back to the high brows.
2938480	2941800	There are dudes who pinch their dicks shut when they're coming and then they
2941800	2944360	come, they come backwards and it doesn't hurt.
2944360	2945840	It doesn't, it doesn't affect anything.
2945880	2948520	And it's good, but it's not bad.
2948560	2949080	It doesn't matter.
2949080	2952920	I think you could mess up your epididymis, give it some blockage or swelling.
2952920	2955720	Your epididymis, your skid, epididymis.
2956920	2961400	Well, is the epididymis, is that, is that part of the weird gun shoot gum
2961400	2963560	looking feeling thing on your testicles?
2964200	2965640	I don't think I have one of those.
2965640	2968480	Oh, that's, you got like a pet check down, man.
2969240	2975720	I think epididymis was the Greek kind of shriveling that I do have.
2975760	2977200	I do have that on my testicles.
2977200	2977360	Yeah.
2978520	2982520	Um, anyways, do you guys, do you guys come a lot?
2984240	2984440	Yeah.
2984480	2985280	What's a lot?
2985320	2988040	Do you mean like a, like a sausage party?
2988040	2991000	I mean, like number of times you know, volume, volume.
2991000	2993240	Oh, no, not really.
2994560	2995680	I don't think I'm coming.
2995680	3002160	I don't, I don't, can I get, I don't know what I just seems like other people
3002160	3008320	about Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.
3008320	3009400	Are you coming a lot?
3010000	3013200	Jeff, Jeff, are you coming a lot right now?
3016080	3020560	Say a regular amount, regular amount story really quick about this.
3020680	3025240	So years ago, my, uh, my, my, my friend's wife was going through, uh, like
3025240	3027040	an Eastern meds, Chinese medicine school.
3027680	3032480	And she was like, well, to become a doctor, like a naturopath or a, or a
3032480	3034880	homopathic doctor, not a doctor, but well, you know what I mean?
3034880	3035840	They call themselves doctors.
3037040	3040840	Um, and she was like, would you come in for my final exam, which is basically me
3040840	3044640	and my, my professor, uh, and I'm doing an exam on you in front of the professor.
3044640	3044880	Yes.
3044880	3046320	They're a professor loosely.
3046440	3046800	Yeah.
3046880	3047680	They're professors.
3048560	3051160	Loose, loose, loose leaf, loose leaf professors.
3051880	3054560	Um, and, uh, and I went, I went, I was like, yeah, sure.
3054560	3055400	Because she was a friend of mine.
3055400	3055960	I went in there.
3056000	3057360	Why am I racing through this?
3057360	3057800	Jesus.
3057800	3058800	Well, because you're panicking.
3058800	3059720	Take your time.
3059720	3061560	Take it easy.
3061560	3062120	Let him tell us.
3062120	3062320	Yeah.
3062320	3065360	I'm like trying to just like, start over.
3065440	3065760	Okay.
3065760	3071400	So because all that sublimated cum you had, it's all so backed up.
3073120	3074640	You got to dilute that with vodka.
3075280	3081360	I wish that's not good.
3081600	3083000	Just tell this right.
3083000	3084080	So here we go really quick.
3084080	3086120	So I, uh, agreed to the exam.
3086120	3087680	I went into the classroom.
3087760	3093000	Uh, yes, it's called a classroom and, uh, and the professor, the professor is in
3093000	3098560	there and he's got, uh, like eight students in there as well as my friend
3098560	3099680	Sarah, who's giving me the exam.
3099680	3101840	And I was like, I thought it was just going to be me and you and your professor.
3102800	3104040	And, uh, and she was like, no, no, no.
3104760	3106120	So can you lay down on the exam table?
3106120	3106800	I'm going to do some stuff.
3106800	3108720	And I was like, I thought it was all going to be like questions or whatever.
3108960	3109800	So she lays me down.
3109800	3113040	She starts doing some like feely touchy feely stuff, checking out my vital
3113040	3115280	organs and whatnot and asking me questions along the way.
3116160	3116480	Yeah.
3116480	3120200	And so one of the questions was, uh, how often do you masturbate?
3120240	3123200	And there's nine grown adults right there.
3124080	3125480	And I'm like, whatever.
3125480	3125920	That's all right.
3125960	3127880	I masturbate frequently.
3128040	3129960	Let's say like two, three times a week, which is a lie.
3129960	3130920	It's like five times a week.
3131080	3131440	What?
3132240	3132400	Yeah.
3133720	3135400	And, um, that's below.
3135440	3137080	But I just want him feeling self-conscious.
3137080	3139440	I'm, I'm, I'm surrounded by nine times a week.
3139840	3142680	So I lied about the amount, but now I'm realizing that I'm a room
3142960	3144400	with many more people in it.
3146960	3149760	All of them jerk off three times a day minimum.
3150320	3150560	Yeah.
3151120	3154720	I just, but I'm like, I'm like, uh, I'm a pillar of, uh, you're like a
3154720	3155320	breaker.
3157600	3157920	Yeah.
3158400	3162040	Um, so I think, you know, I'm not super comfortable with this line of
3162040	3167560	questioning and inevitably she, she says, so how much do you, uh, ejaculate?
3167600	3168920	And again, this is in front of a bunch of people.
3168920	3169200	I don't know.
3169440	3172600	And they're all like scribbling on pads and looking at me like this is going
3172600	3174800	down in some medical, uh, text.
3174840	3175320	Is it?
3175480	3175760	Yes.
3175760	3177040	It's called a medical text.
3178160	3179320	Is it on the papyrus?
3179320	3180120	Is it a scroll?
3180600	3181360	It's on papyrus.
3181360	3181720	Yes.
3182040	3182320	Yeah.
3182440	3183720	So they're written in calligraphy.
3183960	3184280	Yeah.
3184880	3186960	Also, all in Mandarin.
3187280	3189000	The professor or witch doctor.
3190400	3192160	You have to know how to convert into metric.
3192240	3192640	Yeah.
3193360	3194320	Well, this is in Canada.
3194320	3195960	So we were, yeah, we were already on metric.
3195960	3196280	All right.
3196960	3198560	Three dragons breaths.
3200600	3203000	But I'm just looking at her like you fucking asshole.
3203000	3206280	You ambushed me with this weird ass test in front of all your friends.
3207040	3209040	And she's like, how much do you ejaculate?
3209040	3211240	And I was just like, this is a real critical moment.
3211240	3213200	I'm like, do I totally exaggerate?
3213680	3215160	Make myself like, is that a thing?
3215160	3216440	So how would you say it?
3216440	3218120	Like, well, that's what I was like, well, do you mean in like
3218120	3223280	teaspoons, tablespoons, uh, you know, are we talking about her ladle?
3223280	3224480	And she was like, she was only this right.
3224520	3224840	I don't know.
3224840	3225360	Like, like,
3227480	3228440	what's she doing?
3228440	3229160	What is that?
3229160	3229840	What is that?
3229840	3233560	Like, as if it landed on the ground and it just oozed out into a
3233560	3235160	she'd think you're coming a glob.
3235160	3239440	Like I was making like a tennis ball of cum.
3239480	3242160	Like, as if I was making like, like cum pancakes.
3242160	3242920	I had a ladle.
3243000	3243440	Oh yeah.
3244440	3245520	Hey, there we go.
3246000	3246520	Okay.
3246520	3247680	Are they, are they kid's size?
3247680	3249000	Yeah.
3249120	3250280	Child, like children's size.
3250280	3252120	Come pick something like a Belgian waffle.
3253320	3254240	Silver dollar.
3254280	3256560	I can make, I can make a Mickey mouse cake for you.
3258160	3260360	So I just basically, it was like, I was like, yeah.
3260960	3261400	Yeah.
3261520	3261880	Yeah.
3263200	3264200	What is she doing?
3264440	3265240	What does that mean?
3265240	3265880	I don't know.
3265880	3269160	And then, and then, and then I basically finished the exam and left and she gave
3269160	3272000	me a whole bunch of little meds that looked like rabbit poo pellets.
3272720	3275720	And this will help with your ejaculation.
3275720	3279120	And I was like, I didn't, but I told you, I come a lot.
3279120	3280640	And she's like, she was like, come on.
3282560	3283560	It's supposed to be this.
3283560	3287800	So we're all, we're all coming full unicycles over here.
3287800	3289600	So they had like a conference after I left.
3289600	3290920	Like that guy needs to come more.
3290960	3291400	Yeah.
3291440	3292880	Uh, let's give him these pelts.
3293000	3293160	Yeah.
3293160	3295000	So I, what I thought was a gross exaggeration.
3295000	3297080	They were like, no, but it depends.
3297080	3301080	Like if, if you're like, if that's a microscope slide, then it's like
3301720	3307440	if it's a one cell height, then I'm coming fucking highways.
3309080	3309480	That's what I mean.
3309480	3312840	It's all, it's all really relative to like where you're coming in that situation.
3312840	3315720	I mean, just put it in washcloth terms.
3315760	3315920	Yeah.
3315920	3317960	Like how many socks do you need to wipe up?
3318120	3319840	That's a fucking dribbling.
3319840	3321720	How many, how many tube socks do you use to wipe up?
3322720	3325080	Nobody needs more than one tube sock.
3325720	3326680	Sometimes I'll recycle.
3326680	3327800	I use the same sock twice.
3328400	3332160	The chair, like when you're like, he's jerking off and then you go like,
3336120	3337680	then you look down and you're like,
3339120	3339800	nothing happened.
3340240	3340760	Oh yeah.
3341040	3344960	I think I'm fucking hitting home runs and then I look down and it's like a foul
3344960	3345440	ball.
3345440	3349240	What's funny is that, sorry about the baseball.
3349280	3350320	No, it's okay.
3351480	3355000	But it's funny that we would think that that would really, I wonder, I kind of
3355000	3359040	wonder in the back of women's minds, like in their most like their throat.
3359080	3359560	Sorry.
3359560	3363800	I know, obviously like I know the business casual part of their forebrain.
3363800	3365880	They'd be required to say, of course we don't give a shit about that.
3365880	3370120	But, but, but somewhere in the back of their head, some, somebody, you know,
3370120	3373720	there's, I don't know, they want like a monster shooter though.
3373720	3374680	So nice.
3374680	3376160	You know, why not?
3376160	3378640	We have a gal shaking her head vehemently in the front row here.
3378680	3380040	I think there's probably more back there.
3380040	3381000	She's not an ambassador.
3381000	3383240	She's like, we don't know what her deal is.
3383320	3387440	It's like saying, like, Oh, it'd be great if this guy like blew his nose way harder
3387440	3388160	than normal.
3388920	3389400	All this.
3391080	3392280	That's a healthy amount of.
3393000	3393240	Yeah.
3393240	3396320	That's, that's in a world where we're all Vulcans.
3396320	3396640	Yes.
3396640	3399120	That's exactly how everyone would meet mop move.
3399240	3401040	But here's the thing.
3401040	3406800	A fucking, like some people are like, yeah, it's fucking clean it up because it's
3406800	3410680	fucking gooey and gross and give it to me more like fucking sorry.
3410680	3414600	If we hadn't been taught that that equal like virility from pornos, do you think
3414600	3417360	that you would just naturally be like, yeah, if I can feel more like a man,
3417360	3420320	because I think more stuff comes out.
3420320	3421520	You'd be like, I did something.
3421520	3422280	I made more stuff.
3423080	3423400	Yes.
3423400	3427640	Because I think that shit is so primitive that that is like, actually like that's
3427640	3430840	the, that's the original, like it goes all the way back.
3430840	3433440	That's all cavemen ever did was like, how much did you come?
3435000	3437160	They probably did it on a rock and like looked at it.
3437160	3439280	And then they were like, all right, I'll be president.
3439920	3440720	Come contest.
3443000	3444720	He might've just eaten more broccoli.
3444720	3446760	That it's a comeocracy.
3448040	3448760	It's a stock.
3448760	3451760	I just had to add to the rules here.
3452160	3452560	You know what?
3452560	3453800	Don't watch that show.
3453800	3454880	Don't watch deadbeat.
3456560	3457640	It's all about wordplay.
3457680	3461560	You're just going to get ghost jokes and puns.
3462320	3464240	Well, deadbeat itself is a pun.
3464240	3468600	It's a play on words because he's a deadbeat and he's helping dead beat whatever
3468600	3469480	problems they have.
3470040	3470520	It is.
3470560	3471320	It is a pun.
3471360	3472480	Dead beat.
3473480	3474600	That's, that's it.
3474600	3475280	That's, you nailed it.
3475320	3479280	Well, I draw, I draw a line between play on words and like puns, you know, and I
3479280	3484440	guess, I mean, very fine line, you know, okay.
3484440	3485280	You can watch it.
3487280	3489400	The episode I watched, there wasn't any puns.
3489400	3493480	I think it's just something that Camille, you were talking about your movie.
3499040	3501000	Well, yeah, I guess we got a little sidetracked there, didn't we?
3501280	3501640	Yeah.
3502520	3504440	Rob, Rob, that was good.
3504440	3505440	Come trolling now, man.
3520920	3523080	For the listeners, Rob, just put on a hat.
3523720	3525000	I just put my hat on.
3525320	3525720	Okay.
3525960	3528560	You put your hat on while locking eyes with me.
3528640	3529520	I'll take it off.
3529680	3530000	Okay.
3530000	3531160	I won't look at you either.
3531160	3533600	I won't put my vines on while you're eating your bread.
3533600	3535200	I won't just turn it down.
3537920	3539120	No one was complaining.
3539120	3540720	Everybody was having a ball.
3540720	3542600	We're all enjoying ourselves.
3542600	3543720	No one complains.
3543720	3544960	Keep doing it.
3545680	3549640	If everybody is smiling, was everybody smiling?
3549640	3550040	Yeah.
3550320	3553560	Except he's fucking delusional.
3553960	3554880	Everyone's smiling.
3554880	3557600	Like the world is like, Rob, we pollinate.
3557600	3559200	We're all nodding and approving.
3559200	3562320	Rob, were you doing it to try to get Dan's attention to Vi from this?
3562320	3562840	Yes.
3563320	3563960	Yes.
3564560	3565600	Well, you got it.
3565600	3567400	He just wants you to listen to him.
3567400	3568680	Just want to be acknowledged.
3568680	3570120	He just wants your love, Dan.
3570120	3572080	Turn your vines down.
3575360	3577200	He just wants you to acknowledge his vines.
3577200	3579200	That's not even you wanting to get acknowledgement.
3579600	3581200	He just wants you to acknowledge his vines.
3581200	3581720	It's like a...
3582600	3584160	Six seconds at a time.
3585040	3588400	If there was somebody at an adjacent table playing their vines,
3588400	3590040	loud enough for you to hear,
3590040	3591320	I'd walk over.
3592200	3593080	I'd be like,
3593080	3594560	Oh, do you see this one?
3594560	3595400	Oh, yeah.
3595840	3596480	Yeah.
3596480	3597280	Yeah.
3597280	3597760	Yeah.
3597760	3598320	Right.
3598320	3600360	And we'd be happy.
3600360	3600680	Right.
3600680	3601040	Happy.
3601040	3602160	We just want to be happy.
3602160	3603200	Dan, I'm on your side.
3603200	3604360	If I'm out at a restaurant,
3604360	3607840	people that leave their ringers on or talk into their phone like a walkie talkie or...
3607840	3608560	Oh.
3608560	3613080	Or turn or watch a movie at the restaurant.
3613320	3617160	I want to murder in a Elizabethan fashion.
3617160	3617400	Yeah.
3617400	3618280	I want something horrible.
3618280	3619960	Three things I don't do.
3619960	3623320	I'm not a snob about other people's behavior, really,
3623320	3629240	but I'm very, very anxious about my own table being judged by other tables.
3629240	3629400	Yeah.
3629400	3630760	You just want to keep a low pro.
3630760	3631640	I'll cop to that.
3631640	3637080	I want my table to enjoy themselves and have a good time.
3637080	3638680	Well, not be concerned about other tables.
3638680	3641160	You skipped my needs in that department.
3641160	3641800	What?
3642520	3645000	You want your table to have a good time.
3645000	3646440	Most of us were, except for you.
3647640	3649000	Everybody was having a ball.
3649000	3650200	We were all having a ball.
3651160	3652520	How long did this...
3652520	3654600	Did he ask you to turn down the vines?
3654600	3655400	I did, and I...
3655400	3656120	And you did?
3656120	3656600	Yeah.
3656600	3657080	So what's the...
3657080	3657960	Well, that's fucking liar.
3657960	3659000	Yeah, I totally did.
3659000	3659560	Liar.
3659560	3661160	He's lying in front of everyone.
3661160	3662360	That's all he does is lie.
3662360	3663960	That's your perspective.
3663960	3664520	What happened?
3664520	3666360	My perspective is he's a lying...
3666360	3667480	But no, no, no, no.
3667480	3668440	No judgment.
3668440	3669080	No judgment.
3669080	3669560	No, no.
3669560	3670360	Describe the facts.
3670360	3670760	What happened?
3670840	3671720	Do you often turn it down?
3671720	3672200	What did he do?
3672200	3676520	The facts are he knows one thing and is saying a different thing.
3676520	3677240	You said...
3677240	3678600	It's liar-ish.
3679720	3680280	Whoa.
3680280	3683960	Not to judge or anything, but there's a lyification in the room.
3684760	3685160	All right.
3685160	3685880	I'm on your side.
3685880	3686520	I'm a fucking liar.
3687800	3690120	So you said turn down the vines and he didn't turn them down.
3690120	3691640	Yes, for eight years now.
3693640	3693880	Yes.
3693880	3694360	Vines...
3695480	3696440	Vines aren't eight years old.
3696440	3696760	All right.
3696760	3699080	Don't get hung up on that shit.
3699080	3702280	He means vines equals my presence.
3702280	3704280	He wants my presence to turn.
3704280	3705720	He wants you to turn you down.
3705720	3706680	He wants my...
3706680	3709800	What if the lower the opacity on my existence?
3713000	3714040	Then he'll be happy.
3714840	3715960	That's fair though.
3715960	3718680	Worrying about other tables.
3718680	3720040	You're very opaque.
3720040	3720280	Yeah.
3721480	3726040	I wish you guys wouldn't knew like the real Rob Shrob.
3726760	3730840	Like who like on his birthday, people are like,
3730840	3732440	happy birthday.
3732440	3734040	And he's like, no, no, no.
3736040	3737560	Hates the birthday song.
3737560	3740840	Hates it if someone else's birthday.
3740840	3742440	Hey, Rob, let's play Pictionary.
3742440	3743800	No, no, no.
3743800	3748360	Like everything's like, hey, Rob, can I use a writing utensil?
3748360	3749000	Utensil.
3750360	3751320	It's the best of...
3753320	3754520	You're full of hatred.
3755160	3756360	You're a hateful person.
3756360	3757320	And it's...
3757320	3758360	So not true.
3759080	3759720	You play this.
3759720	3760280	Not true.
3760280	3761800	No, he's gaslighting me.
3762600	3763160	Not true.
3763800	3765640	He always makes it look like I'm the bad guy,
3765640	3766760	but he's a monster.
3767640	3769240	You hate a lot of things too.
3770440	3771640	You hate wordplay.
3771640	3773560	You hate wordplay.
3773560	3775240	You hate sports and wordplay.
3776600	3778120	You know something I do too.
3779480	3780120	You know what?
3781640	3782360	I like you.
3785400	3788280	I don't get sick of hanging out with you.
3788280	3789400	You know, you're so mean.
3792520	3798440	Well, I guess that's a shrub of a different color.
3803160	3807480	Happy birthday to you.
3809080	3813320	Happy birthday to you.
3815000	3820440	Happy birthday, America.
3822360	3824920	Happy birthday.
3834200	3838600	Happy birthday to you.
3838600	3846360	Happy birthday to you.
3846360	3847240	It's 9th and 12th.
3847240	3850840	Happy birthday, dear.
3854520	3860360	Happy birthday to you.
3861560	3863000	One more time.
3863000	3863480	I know.
3863480	3867800	Happy birthday to you.
3869720	3875960	Happy birthday to you.
3875960	3876760	Just the girls.
3876760	3882760	Happy birthday, dear.
3882760	3883560	I know what I see.
3883560	3889560	Happy birthday to you.
3889560	3891720	I'm sorry, but he can sit here.
3891720	3892360	I like it a lot.
3892360	3892840	We did it.
3893480	3899080	I love the song now.
3899080	3902600	There currently is no award for best podcasts.
3902600	3903480	There should be.
3903480	3906680	I think we should be winning the best podcast award right now.
3907880	3909560	Well, you were talking about your movie.
3912040	3912920	No, I wasn't.
3913960	3915480	I have nothing to say about it.
3916120	3917640	I think it is a good podcast man.
3917640	3918680	What are we supposed to?
3918680	3925880	What are we supposed to sit up here and talk about Game of Thrones?
3925880	3927960	Bring Game of Thrones.
3927960	3928840	Great set, bro.
3928840	3930120	So basically this is what happened.
3931080	3937800	Last week I was at the Game of Thrones premiere and I was hanging out and this gentleman came
3937800	3939960	up to me and he was very nice.
3939960	3943240	And he was like, oh, I love Hormontown.
3943240	3944920	I'm a huge fan of Hormontown.
3944920	3945960	And I said, oh, thanks, man.
3945960	3946920	That means a lot.
3946920	3948520	You know, the normal thing.
3949400	3951000	And I was about to be like, thanks, man.
3951000	3951320	So much.
3951320	3954600	And then I was like, oh my God, this is Grey Worm.
3954600	3957880	Grey Worm from Grey Worm.
3957880	3958840	He plays Grey Worm.
3958840	3964120	So, so I got his email and I'm going to bring it up, bring him up right now.
3964120	3966040	Please welcome to the stage Jacob Anderson.
3966040	3966600	Are you here?
3967960	3968680	There he is.
3969480	3970200	There he is.
3976920	3997960	Yo, yo, yo, hello.
3997960	4003960	Hey, um, uh, I don't drink, but if I was someone who drank, I would have been very drunk at
4003960	4004760	this party.
4004760	4005720	I was so drunk.
4005720	4011640	And I'm so drunk and I was very, uh, I was trying to figure out if I said anything stupid
4011640	4014200	to you or was it, was our interaction fine?
4014200	4016360	You said so much dumb shit.
4016360	4017000	Did I?
4017000	4017720	Yeah.
4017720	4018840	It was embarrassing.
4018840	4020040	Yeah, it was, right?
4020040	4021800	That's how I figured it was going to be.
4023640	4024120	Jacob.
4024760	4025400	Yes.
4025400	4026680	I, uh, we haven't.
4026680	4028840	Sorry, this is so, this is so weird.
4028840	4032200	He's a huge, he's a huge fan of this show.
4032200	4034200	I've listened to every episode of Hormontown.
4035720	4043480	I wish it, we should probably plug your show too.
4045480	4049880	It premieres, uh, April 7th, four 20.
4049880	4055720	I think four 20, four, four, 25, four, 25, four, is it?
4055720	4058280	Four 24, April, April 24.
4058280	4058920	Yep.
4058920	4059720	April 24.
4060280	4061960	It's called game of thrones.
4061960	4063080	Let's get the word out.
4063080	4066760	Why is it called game of thrones when there's only one throne in it?
4070200	4071800	That's a great question.
4073720	4075080	What the fuck, Jacob?
4076440	4077720	What are you doing?
4077720	4083640	So, the central premise of, of the, the show and the thrones is, uh, there's this balloon.
4085400	4086040	And the balloons.
4089960	4090840	I like this show.
4090840	4091320	I like it.
4091320	4092680	I gotta start watching this show.
4092680	4095800	I have a serious, I have a serious question in my game of thrones.
4095800	4096040	Yeah.
4097000	4099160	What, how does castration work?
4099160	4106280	Like, because there are, there are numerous characters who are without various levels of
4106280	4107560	gonadry.
4107560	4112360	Like, like, like, like, reek has clearly been like mutilated.
4112360	4113080	Everything's gone.
4113080	4113960	I'm reek.
4113960	4118040	Yeah, but your character, your character, for instance, it's like, it's like,
4118040	4121640	and all the unsullied, they are castrated, which I always understood.
4121720	4128280	I mean, simple, the removal of the testes implying that the wiener is still there.
4129080	4131560	I, I, that's my understanding.
4131560	4132040	Yeah.
4132040	4133480	Are the wiener is still there?
4134200	4135160	I believe so.
4135160	4136280	I don't know if that's a spoiler.
4138920	4141160	Wait, is that a big plot point this season?
4142600	4147240	What is the level of genital mutilation?
4148360	4150440	All the unsullied coming with giant boners.
4151400	4153880	Look, Martin's not done with the final book.
4153880	4154680	Yeah.
4154680	4156520	You don't know what the title is.
4156520	4156760	Yeah.
4157640	4159720	It's called What's Left of the Unsullied.
4160680	4163880	But here's a, here's an actual serious question on that note.
4163880	4165240	No, but that is a good question.
4165240	4165640	Oh, okay.
4165640	4170520	If I'd gotten the job, if I, my first question would be, so what are we talking about?
4170520	4173160	Like, is there a penis or no, nothing?
4173160	4173800	Is it nothing?
4173800	4174680	You don't know.
4174680	4175480	No, I asked.
4176200	4177000	Who's asked?
4177000	4177640	What did they say?
4178200	4181240	Um, I believe the, the sausage is still there.
4181800	4184120	The, the, the sausage.
4185320	4186040	That bit.
4186040	4186360	Yeah.
4186360	4187400	The baby's arm.
4187960	4188200	Okay.
4190040	4192840	Yeah, I think that's the dick bit.
4192840	4197000	So when you're, yeah, the dick bit is called, it's called the dick.
4198200	4201640	This is genuinely every conversation I have with anyone ever.
4204680	4207320	Nobody's ever like, wait, what's north of the
4207480	4208440	wall and when's the.
4208440	4210680	Jacob, I can't believe how you're English.
4210680	4211160	I imagine.
4211160	4211880	Right.
4211880	4212600	Yes.
4212600	4215640	That's the most English answer is the sausage, you know, the sausage.
4215640	4216120	Yeah.
4216120	4218920	You know, the dick bit, but now Barry.
4218920	4219480	The dick bit.
4220280	4222040	Well, what's your serious question?
4222040	4226760	The Piccadilly circus is, you know, well, my serious question based on that is also,
4226760	4232680	so you're on probably if that, I mean, so this show is like, uh, I mean, obviously you
4232680	4237000	have to sign an NDA, you have to like, like, like, like, how much trouble are you at risk
4237000	4237960	of what do they tell you?
4237960	4240760	How in the dark are you about plot lines and things?
4240760	4244920	And when you do interviews, ask me some questions and we'll find out.
4246440	4249080	Jacob, you did tell me a spoiler that night.
4249080	4251880	You told me something that I don't know if, well,
4251880	4255160	I'm not going to say it because I don't know what level of spoiler it was.
4255160	4257640	Can you whisper it into a microphone?
4260920	4263720	You can't do this in front of an audience of big fans.
4263720	4264520	That's not fair.
4266520	4267080	Text it.
4267080	4267880	I know what it is.
4267880	4268520	I know what it is.
4268520	4269000	Text it to Chevy Chase.
4275960	4278760	I didn't, I stepped on your, I didn't, I said something.
4278760	4279400	That's okay.
4280200	4280680	I was done.
4285480	4291160	Uh, is it, it's, it's, uh, the, uh, your, one of your balls goes back this season.
4293720	4294840	But it's a dragon egg.
4298120	4303240	But then the, but, but then the dragon is, uh, Jamie Lannister's hand.
4305560	4311880	And then that hand, uh, drowns, uh, stone man.
4314040	4314520	Jura.
4315720	4316280	Sure.
4316280	4317160	What's Jura mama?
4319160	4319640	I don't know.
4321240	4322600	I really want to see that show.
4323880	4325800	You should watch it.
4325800	4326760	It's called game of thrones.
4328600	4329320	Here's a question.
4329320	4334200	Like, well, so one of the, we're all gearing up to watch the next season.
4334200	4337800	So one of the, but sorry, Dan, I don't, I don't mean to interrupt you, but I know
4337800	4338920	you're a terrible interviewer.
4338920	4340600	You don't have to, you don't have to pretend.
4342200	4344840	I wasn't, I wasn't pretending, but thank you for reminding me.
4344840	4346360	Just be yourself, Dan.
4347320	4349320	He's on board already.
4349320	4351080	I wasn't even trying to interview.
4351080	4353480	Don't go for segways or.
4353480	4356360	I was just going with the flow and asking like fanboy questions.
4356360	4361880	I just wanted to know, like, uh, like, so, uh, when you, you had that big fight scene.
4361880	4365560	I mean, you had a lot of fight scenes, but like that big one where everyone's dying
4365560	4368840	left and right and every, I'm on the edge of my seat, like, which of these fucking
4368840	4370600	guys is going to die and who's going to live?
4370600	4371960	Like how am I in those scenes?
4371960	4374520	Like, how much, like, what do you, you seem like a fit guy.
4374520	4378440	I'm not hitting on you, but, uh, like, I don't know how much, but if you were,
4378440	4381720	it would go a little something like this.
4381720	4382600	It's a dumb question.
4382600	4386600	I'm just curious about the, uh, amount of like stunt, stunt, stunt, mannery,
4386600	4389080	like how that shit works, the, how much you have to learn.
4389080	4393800	How much, how much stick twirling and did you have to learn?
4393800	4395480	And what are you, you know, I don't know.
4395480	4396840	Just general area.
4396840	4401560	They didn't, they really didn't want me to do it because of insurance, I guess.
4401560	4404760	And I'm not sure, but I did all of it in the last one.
4404760	4406360	The, the spinny one, I did all of that.
4406360	4407000	That was fun.
4408280	4408520	Yeah.
4408520	4411160	They, they kind of, that was such a.
4411160	4412840	Now, were you, were you trained?
4412840	4414520	I wasn't courting that by the way.
4416200	4420120	Jacob, were you, were you trained in any like stunt man or martial arts or anything
4420120	4421080	like that before that?
4421080	4421720	Not at all.
4421720	4423000	It's like dancing.
4423000	4424440	You just have to be able to count.
4424440	4426920	If you can count to 30, then you can, you can do it.
4426920	4430040	I bet there's plenty of people here who can count to 30 and can't.
4430040	4430840	Toil a sore.
4433720	4435000	Wait, are you trained in dancing?
4436120	4436600	No.
4436600	4436920	No.
4436920	4437240	Okay.
4437240	4440120	So none of you, but Jacob, do you think you could write a juice cycle?
4442120	4443480	I could try.
4443480	4444120	All right.
4444120	4444760	All right.
4444760	4449400	So, no, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't this.
4449400	4451400	We can't fucking hurt him.
4451400	4452440	No, that's not clear for a joke.
4452440	4453400	What if he gets an injury?
4453400	4454600	Like you got an injury.
4454600	4461000	Guys, if, if our podcast kills gray, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're like a new house
4461000	4461960	in game of thrones.
4467480	4470280	I mean, they could kill him over four seasons.
4470920	4476360	The thing is that I did, I mean, this is crazy for a podcast of our level to have
4476360	4483080	this kind of exclusive, but we, we do have a sneak preview that we're able to provide.
4483080	4483720	Oh shit.
4483720	4484040	Yeah.
4484040	4484920	We have the clip.
4484920	4485320	Yeah.
4485320	4489320	Well, it's a, no, we don't, we have, we just got the script like, and
4490600	4495640	Jacob said he would perform it with us in the, uh, that it's a, it's a scene.
4495640	4497800	It's a crucial scene from the new season.
4498760	4503400	And I, I, I, I, I, he's, he told me I had to be in it in the scene.
4505000	4506840	Dan, do you, do you want to set this up?
4506840	4508680	Do you want to set the scene up or should Jacob,
4508680	4511480	it's like, well, there's, as you know, for most of the seasons,
4511480	4513240	they keep introducing new kingdoms and things.
4513240	4518680	And I, I'm, I'm, I, I'm going to play this, a new, uh, Lord, uh, from, from, from house,
4518680	4523320	uh, house, house, house, house, cock, cock, cock, house, house, rock, rock and cock.
4523560	4527720	Like, it's, it's just, he's a cool guy.
4527720	4533080	And he's like, what is it from house, cock and rock, rock and cock and cock.
4533080	4537240	Like, as in you got a rock and I'm, I guess I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,
4537240	4542360	I'm from the Eastern realms and I'm kind of like a badass uncompromising guy.
4542360	4547640	And, uh, gray worm finds out that he's actually the bastard child of, uh,
4547640	4552200	that he, and he, he takes his boat back, uh, and finds me.
4552200	4557640	And, uh, and we do a scene, uh, together and then, uh, yeah.
4568440	4569960	I'm like cutting a wild boar.
4582200	4602600	That was some scary shit, man.
4604600	4606600	Fucking put this wild boar in the cupboard.
4606600	4618520	That sounds like my biological son.
4625560	4630280	And I, I don't know if when he sees me, he'll be happy or sad.
4630280	4639480	So I will take my house's trademark weapon, the boar knife,
4641800	4646600	out onto the sandy coast of house rock and cock.
4651720	4652920	This is a lot of stairs.
4660280	4661720	So, so you're not right on the beach.
4662920	4664440	I'm not very close to the beach.
4665960	4667240	We're watching the episode.
4668200	4669880	I wonder what something's going to happen.
4673000	4674040	This is a lantern.
4676360	4678040	We can see he's holding a lantern.
4678040	4679800	Why is he saying he doesn't even say it?
4679800	4681720	I don't see the lantern.
4681720	4683080	Why is he saying it again?
4683080	4686440	Because I don't want people to think I need props.
4686440	4688440	Yeah, he's like, so what the fuck?
4690040	4694120	Oh, next level HBO programming.
4694120	4694920	Holy shit.
4700680	4703160	Oh, Lord, Lord harmonious.
4703160	4706920	I, I would recommend you don't walk down those steps alone tonight.
4706920	4713560	Oh, here we go.
4716440	4717480	Use your microphone, Rob.
4717480	4718360	Use your microphone.
4720520	4722200	You should let somebody come with you.
4723720	4726920	It's, it's really, really, really treacherous.
4729080	4732280	It's really treacherous on the, on the staircase.
4733240	4737080	I believe myself more than capable of depressing my own house.
4737080	4738120	Troll man.
4739640	4743800	Lord harmonious, may I send my troll servant with you to protect yourself?
4743800	4748280	It's all a part of the, the, the, the fun here.
4750680	4753320	Let me, let me come with you down the stairs.
4754840	4758280	I can't believe this stretched the storyline out over four episodes.
4761320	4763240	Let me hold that lantern for you.
4763240	4765720	At this point, I just want them to go downstairs.
4765720	4774440	Cut to, cut to Camille and Jacob down to down on the Italian chip.
4776920	4777480	Where are we?
4777480	4778920	Yeah, you unsullied ship.
4778920	4782760	Oh, like what's your deal down there?
4785880	4789080	Like, is it the sausage or the biscuits or?
4790920	4793080	Man, it's just the dick bit.
4793240	4796200	Oh, I don't believe you.
4799560	4801400	Cut back to the staircase, back to the staircase.
4808920	4811080	I'll accept your service troll man.
4812040	4812600	All right.
4813640	4815640	But you should know I've heard the rumors.
4817560	4818680	That was a big one.
4820200	4821080	You're so good.
4821960	4823400	What a good boy you are.
4824520	4827160	I told you the staircase is treacherous.
4830360	4833720	This goes in the black trash can, not the green one.
4838440	4839480	Fucking dragons.
4843080	4844120	Take off your pants.
4846200	4847480	Is the dragon coming?
4848200	4849640	Is the dragon coming?
4849640	4852280	Quick, take off your clothes and your pants first.
4853080	4854360	There's a dragon coming.
4857080	4859240	This better be a thing.
4859240	4860200	Take off your pants.
4860760	4861720	Take off your pants.
4862760	4863960	If the dragon's coming.
4863960	4865000	I don't see one.
4865000	4867080	Dragons coming, take off your pants.
4867080	4868600	I took them off.
4868600	4869880	Okay, okay.
4871080	4873160	Cut back to these unsullied boat.
4873160	4873560	Okay.
4873560	4874840	Hey, we're going to defeat them.
4874840	4876440	We have dragons on our side.
4876440	4878280	Oh fuck, they're not wearing pants.
4879240	4880920	We don't have a shot anymore.
4882360	4884040	How did they know that works?
4886440	4887640	Can you count to 30?
4890280	4891320	One, two.
4891320	4892200	Cut back to the staircase.
4895640	4896920	That was a close one.
4901960	4903880	I got some good news and bad news.
4904840	4907080	Good news is the dragon's gone.
4907080	4910440	Bad news is I lost the lantern.
4913880	4915480	Lord harmonious.
4915480	4916440	Lord harmonious.
4916440	4920040	Oh, it seems an unsullied ship has landed on the top.
4920040	4921800	Where's that voice coming from?
4923320	4924760	I'm right behind you.
4924760	4925640	Right over here.
4929080	4929880	Oh no.

4942280	4942920	Troll.
4942920	4943320	Troll.
4943320	4943720	I'm trying.
4943720	4945000	Troll, take your shirt off.
4945000	4946440	Take your shirt off, troll.
4946440	4948520	No, actually, don't mind me.
4948520	4949560	Actually, take your shirt off.
4949560	4951400	There's so many shirts on here.
4952520	4953320	So many shirts.
4954120	4955800	Take your fucking shirt off, troll.
4959160	4959800	The harmonious.
4959800	4960760	The ship is landed.
4960760	4962120	We're getting out of here.
4962120	4964120	The unsullied are marching up the staircase
4964120	4965080	towards you right now.
4965080	4966200	I think we got to run.
4966200	4967240	Then I shall greet them.
4967960	4972760	For as I've learned, one of the unsullied is my seed.
4975320	4976440	Like this, or?
4981160	4981560	What?
4981560	4982360	I didn't hear.
4982360	4983000	How big is it up there?
4983000	4983560	I didn't hear.
4984280	4985800	How big is the seed?
4985800	4986040	Oh.
4988280	4989160	Dumb nerds.
4989800	4990360	Stupid.
4993080	4996600	We fast forward to a scene with Aya Stark,
4996600	4999000	and the weird faceless guy, and a bunch of weird shit.
4999000	5001480	We come back to the staircase.
5001480	5003080	Oh, and the fucking magic kids?
5003080	5003720	Yeah.
5003720	5005480	Yeah, those magic kids.
5009240	5010200	Oh, there.
5010200	5011960	Yeah, what's going on now?
5011960	5014200	Identify your kingdom and your home.
5014200	5016680	Or we'll get you.
5016680	5017160	Can you?
5017800	5018120	Can you?
5021720	5022200	For real.
5022200	5023400	I'm the lord of my...
5024440	5024920	Yes.
5024920	5025800	Lord Cockenrass.
5025800	5027640	Hey, you talk to him first.
5027640	5028680	One's wearing no pants.
5028680	5029800	One's wearing no shirt.
5032680	5034120	Am I skipping on your cords?
5034120	5035080	You talk to him.
5035080	5035480	Stage two.
5035480	5036920	29, 30.
5036920	5037640	Okay, now you go.
5039640	5041240	Um, hi.
5043800	5045000	Why are you starting with hi?
5045000	5046200	Be badass.
5047480	5047960	Hey.
5050760	5051320	It's me.
5052360	5053000	A badass.
5055560	5056040	Todd?
5060280	5065400	I'm so sorry I sold you to people who castrated you.
5067240	5067720	Father?
5068600	5070440	It was what everyone was doing.
5074840	5076680	Wait, uh, this is your dad?
5077160	5079480	The apple fell pretty far from the tree.
5082200	5083480	I believe you have my...
5084120	5085880	I'll set a different advantage.
5088360	5091000	I am lord impediment of speech.
5093560	5094920	I know you lost your balls,
5094920	5096920	but I think it would have been better
5096920	5098920	than being raised by this one.
5100120	5100600	100%.
5103720	5104520	Todd Snow.
5108040	5109000	Yes, father.
5110040	5113560	I hope that past can be forgotten.
5114120	5117000	I need now a warrior to lead my kingdom.
5117000	5119800	There is only one way for the past to be forgotten.
5124120	5126600	A father who sells his son into castration.
5127880	5128920	There's only one way...
5129720	5130200	Hello.
5130200	5130520	Hello.
5131960	5132440	Hello.
5133960	5134440	I'm sorry.
5134440	5135240	Could you repeat that?
5135240	5136040	The door was closed.
5136120	5137400	We didn't hear any of that.
5137400	5137560	Oh!
5138280	5139560	It was just muffled.
5139560	5141720	My name is Lord Highstakes.
5143560	5145000	I raise stakes.
5147160	5148840	The father who sells his own son
5148840	5150600	into castration into the unsullied
5151320	5155240	must only settle the score in mortal combat.
5159240	5161160	With the son?
5161160	5162920	Yeah, you gotta fight your son, bitch.
5164440	5165720	Gotta fight that son.
5165720	5167560	You cut his balls off, dick.
5167560	5169400	Now he knows how to spin a stick
5169400	5170760	and fucking fuck you up.
5170760	5171640	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5171640	5172520	Here, I'll train you.
5172520	5173720	Can you count to 30?
5175720	5176220	Yes.
5177640	5179240	Let's go.
5179240	5182840	I'll hold your rope, me lord.
5182840	5185240	I don't know how this will solve things because...
5185240	5187240	Lord Harmonia's training montage.
5195720	5201320	Three pull-ups.
5205080	5207080	At least get to 30.
5217000	5218040	You raped my sister.
5219800	5220600	You didn't really.
5220600	5222360	I just, I heard that's a thing to say.
5226520	5229080	Whoa.
5229080	5230280	Yeah, that was a new thing.
5230280	5230760	Fuck.
5242680	5243160	We're in...
5244280	5245080	Crow?
5245080	5246120	We're in Crow now.
5246120	5246600	Crow?
5246600	5248120	Yeah, we're in Crow.
5248120	5250040	Wow, the fucking is so much lower.
5251000	5252200	It looks like shit.
5253880	5254360	Son.
5255880	5256380	Fuck.
5264440	5265080	Jesus.
5265080	5266360	Son, please stop.
5266360	5266840	Stop.
5267720	5269800	Aren't both of your mom's names Martha?
5272520	5273400	Oh, shit.
5276360	5276840	All right.
5278360	5279960	Scene and scene.
5279960	5281400	That's a good, that's a good, that's a good closer.
5282360	5284200	All right, whose mic is this?
5284280	5287160	That was a rare spoiler for season six of Game of Thrones, you guys.
5296120	5296920	That was good.
5296920	5297560	I like that.
5299880	5304520	Jacob is also, by the way, a very popular musician as well.
5305320	5307080	Will you perform under a different name?
5307080	5307960	Yeah, yeah, I do.
5308600	5309400	Buster Rhimes.
5311320	5311960	Nobody knows.
5311960	5313080	There's a lot of makeup and...
5317720	5319320	Hollywood's best kept secret.
5321160	5323960	What is your musical handle called?
5324520	5326840	My musical handle is Raleigh Richie.
5328360	5329800	Raleigh Richie?
5329800	5333640	Yes, the Raleigh like the bike and Richie like Lionel.
5334840	5335320	Is my...
5335320	5336360	And we're rich.
5337560	5338520	What sort of music is this?
5338520	5340840	So you're like, you're on a badass show.
5341560	5343960	You're a very successful musician.
5343960	5346520	Your voice makes my balls vibrate.
5346520	5346840	I just...
5349640	5350760	Look at this fucking guy.
5352040	5353160	He's got it going on.
5356120	5357480	There's room for both of you.
5360280	5361720	Jacob, when did you start listening?
5361720	5366520	And why are you a Hymantown fan?
5366520	5367480	How did that come about?
5371400	5372920	I started listening.
5372920	5374600	I'm a community fan.
5376360	5377320	I don't know why I said that.
5377320	5378920	Like, it was some sort of...
5379560	5380760	It was like AA or something.
5382360	5384040	I'm Jacob and I'm a community fan.
5384920	5386600	What was his favorite season? Season...
5387320	5387800	Four.
5387800	5388280	Season four.
5388840	5390440	Yeah, I love season four.
5390440	5391960	Sounds good.
5391960	5392680	Really good.
5393400	5395480	Really, really caught the tone finally.
5397720	5400760	They really hit their stride and then somehow lost it.
5400920	5401960	I don't know what changed.
5401960	5402440	I don't know.
5403160	5405480	But at least we got season four anyway.
5407800	5409800	I haven't actually watched all of season four.
5410520	5412440	In solidarity, it upset me.
5412440	5415000	I had to because I just wanted to be a good showrunner.
5415000	5420920	And then I got up here all drunk and I made bad comments about it
5420920	5424440	that I only meant to be self-deprecating about my experience.
5425880	5429320	But I think the people that worked on that season worked very hard.
5430280	5431800	Wow, you really gave it up there.
5433960	5437400	I mean, they really...
5437960	5439400	Audio and video was in sync.
5444920	5447160	Seemed like none of the credits were misspelled.
5451480	5452280	Well, that's how...
5452280	5453960	I mean, it's going to be amazing to...
5453960	5455560	I mean, your character's not dead.
5455560	5457880	So we're going to be watching this guy
5457880	5465080	and he's going to be fighting gaggus and having passionate, strange
5466120	5469960	will they, won't theys with certain courtiers.
5469960	5470600	No spoilers.
5470600	5472040	I have no inside information.
5472040	5474520	But then every time we watch now this season,
5474520	5477720	we can go like, that dude knows who Dave Klein is.
5478760	5479720	Yeah, by the way.
5484600	5485100	Yup.
5485400	5486520	Oh, shit, Jesus.
5488280	5490600	You're awesome.
5490600	5496120	If you come in, long story short, I'll give you a voice to a lot of people.
5497640	5498840	You're a beautiful creature.
5502360	5507320	It takes a lot of fury to understand where you're coming from.
5509800	5513880	And what I'm trying to say is that there aren't a lot of actors
5515240	5517640	who could even attempt to do the shit you're doing.
5518440	5521400	And like, where I'm really personally coming from is like,
5521400	5530760	I know a lot of hardcore dudes who could call a candle dude.
5531720	5533480	I like that this is the short version.
5534840	5535960	Long story short.
5540440	5541480	I'm a big fan of yours.
5543880	5545080	Dave Klein and Dershman.
5545080	5547400	Yeah, I wanted to say as well, thank you guys.
5547480	5551800	Because this is like, I feel like we're all slightly unstable humans in this room.
5557880	5562280	And this show sorts me right out when I'm feeling...
5563240	5564280	That's very flattering.
5564280	5567240	When you talked to me, were you hoping?
5567240	5569960	Because I had to convince you to come on stage.
5569960	5570360	Yeah.
5570360	5571800	When you were talking, were you like,
5571800	5576040	oh, I hope he hooks me up with Dan so I can get on the show?
5576040	5576760	Or is this like...
5576760	5577880	No, not at all.
5577880	5579000	No, I was a bit worried.
5580920	5583160	I mean, actually, to use like a community reference.
5583160	5586440	I'm sorry, I'm just going to be a fan.
5586440	5589160	But I don't know why a community is such a...
5590040	5591640	I'm attaching so much shame to it.
5593160	5596600	Jacob, Jacob, here's how much shadows you have right now.
5596600	5598760	Dan is sitting down at Spencer's table right now.
5601720	5603560	I'm kneeling. I'm on my knees.
5604120	5609800	No, I was really concerned that with all of you guys,
5610840	5614840	that I would have like a Troy LaVaba and kind of experience.
5614840	5616360	And I'm sort of having it.
5617400	5618520	And I'm talking too much.
5618520	5620520	But thank you for everything.
5620520	5621800	You guys are amazing.
5621800	5623000	Thank you so much for coming.
5624760	5628680	Should we turn him loose so that he doesn't have to feel the anxiety anymore?
5628680	5629080	I mean...
5630440	5633400	My question was, are you visiting town right now?
5633400	5634360	Do you live in LA?
5634360	5637800	No, no, I came down for the premiere and then I just stayed around.
5637800	5639800	And you go back to England or what?
5639800	5642440	I go to New York on Tuesday.
5643960	5647080	Hey, I'm going to be there. We should like hang out.
5647080	5647580	Yeah.
5649640	5650200	Okay, cool.
5661240	5663160	Can I say hello to my friend George?
5663560	5665240	You can do whatever you want, gray worm.
5665240	5665880	Bye, George.
5670920	5671800	Yeah, I mean...
5671800	5677240	Jacob, I started listening to Harmontown about two years ago.
5680520	5683480	So before, were you on Game of Thrones already at that point?
5683480	5685720	Were you already shooting Game of Thrones or...
5685720	5687880	Or is this the part where you already were?
5687880	5688360	Okay.
5688360	5691400	Can I ask a really mundane question that you must get asked all the time?
5691400	5694840	When you're doing the other languages, how does that work?
5694840	5696920	Like, did you get schooled on all the...
5698920	5702600	It's really boring. I feel like this is a comedy show and I feel like I'm bringing it down.
5703480	5705960	I want to know, too. That was my question, too. I want to know, too.
5707240	5708200	Where does that take you?
5708200	5710120	All those languages. They kind of mind-blowing.
5710920	5713640	We get sent an MP3 and we just listen to it.
5714680	5715800	You kind of listen to it on repeat.
5715800	5719000	So you have somebody who can scratch vocals that you just kind of mimic?
5719000	5719640	Basically, yeah.
5719640	5720040	Really?
5720120	5722760	But then you have to learn how to act them.
5722760	5724120	Act them and perform them.
5726120	5728760	Can I elaborate on the question? I've always wanted to know, as an actor,
5728760	5731720	what is it like acting in a language that doesn't exist?
5731720	5735720	Like, do you just sort of... Is it all about the emoting at that point?
5735720	5737640	Is it all about sort of just your body language?
5739000	5741240	You pick one syllable, that's the syllable that you...
5741240	5743560	Yeah, like what do you land with your dialogue?
5743560	5747240	The hardest one is talking to other people that are talking in a different language.
5747880	5753560	You have to... It's like picking up cues, but picking up words that don't exist.
5753560	5756360	Oh, so you have to like, all right, I think you're done with your gobbledygook.
5756360	5757960	Time for my gobbledygook.
5757960	5758680	Yeah, basically.
5759720	5761720	I don't think they like that on Game of Thrones.
5761720	5764920	I've seen you do that on the show. Sometimes you're like, oh, okay, me?
5767800	5769560	I'm like, they should edit that out.
5770920	5773960	Well, I have never seen that on Game of Thrones.
5773960	5775640	And that's a real testament to you, man.
5776440	5779320	Never seen that moment of like, I don't know what you're saying to me.
5779320	5780360	It's fucking unreal, man.
5780360	5783160	That's why you guys always have the light earphones in your ears.
5783160	5785800	When you're speaking in... What is the language of the Unsullied?
5786760	5787320	Valyrian.
5788520	5789960	Do you ever do a take?
5789960	5790520	Valyrian.
5793000	5793960	It's not a medication.
5795320	5800360	Do you do a take when you're saying a line in that language and the director goes,
5801080	5804600	Jacob, can we take it again and really hit the gobbledygook?
5809720	5812040	Do they give you notes, like line reads?
5813560	5815880	I could be saying any old shit, to be fair.
5817640	5821400	I think not to undermine the directors, because there's some great directors,
5821400	5824520	but yeah, I think they're very often just like great.
5824520	5826280	How much do you actually have to know your lines?
5827000	5827720	Yeah.
5827720	5829880	And do you like improvise in the language?
5829960	5831480	They're like, hey, please stay on scrap.
5831480	5832120	What the fuck?
5834680	5837560	Fuckin', we spend a lot of time writing these syllables.
5838680	5841080	Because you know that, yeah, no, there's guest directors coming through,
5841080	5843400	so they're on their iPad and their fantasy football leagues.
5843400	5844840	And they're like, okay, great.
5844840	5847080	And you're like, yeah, I'm the one that has to be here next week.
5847720	5848520	Exactly, yeah.
5849800	5851480	Is it like a difficult show to shoot?
5851480	5852760	Is it like really grueling?
5852760	5854840	It feels like it would be like long hours and...
5855800	5859000	Yeah, it's long hours, but genuinely,
5859000	5862760	I really want to come on here and talk some shit about it.
5862760	5867960	It's like, it's the best job in the world, genuinely.
5867960	5869080	It's really fun.
5871240	5874040	There's different castes in different worlds, different kingdoms and stuff.
5874920	5876360	What's the best one to be in?
5876360	5878920	And what castes talks the most shit about?
5878920	5880520	It's definitely not the wall,
5880520	5883320	because they're like in fucking cold ass, horrible weather.
5883880	5886840	And then everybody else is like, warm climbs.
5886920	5889240	What cast has the easiest and what cast has the hardest?
5889240	5889640	Yeah.
5889640	5891480	We have the easiest, because we're always in the sun.
5893560	5893720	Yeah.
5894600	5896280	Sometimes you get nipple cut off.
5897240	5897800	Oh, yeah, yeah.
5897800	5898440	Yeah, that's true.
5899080	5899720	That's true.
5899720	5900120	I've got...
5900120	5900440	Do you know what?
5900440	5902760	I can give you one spoiler for this year.
5902760	5903560	I've got a new...
5905080	5906600	No, you've built it up now.
5906600	5907080	I've got...
5908280	5910200	So, no, it's because I was thinking about the heat.
5910200	5915240	And I used to wear a tunic that I'd like create waterfalls down the front of my body.
5915240	5916840	In the heat, it was disgusting.
5917960	5919080	It's the worst.
5919080	5919800	It's the worst.
5919800	5921480	But I've got a new jacket this year.
5921480	5924120	At least five people are turned on by this.
5924120	5928360	Wait, you're excited that you now have a jacket coming up this year?
5928360	5929400	Oh, yeah.
5931960	5933960	Because the sun is that hot that it's like...
5934840	5935720	Actually, it's just like...
5935720	5937640	So it's as opposed to it beating down and you...
5937640	5939000	Yeah, yeah, it's a little bit better.
5939000	5940840	Your costume, I mean, those costumes are like...
5941480	5942280	It fits everything.
5942280	5943800	I'm not talking shit on the show.
5943880	5949400	But they're doing so much with the production level.
5949400	5951800	It's like your costume, the Unsullied are...
5953240	5954280	They're a lot like...
5954280	5956360	When I was in sixth grade, I played a tooth.
5960440	5961720	I was the third molar.
5964360	5965960	There's costumes that are just like...
5965960	5967080	They have to be minimalist.
5967080	5970040	Well, because they also have to make fucking dragons.
5970040	5971720	And they're like, oh, we don't have much money left.
5971880	5974440	Also, why would he be wearing like a, you know,
5974440	5976360	popped collar and have like poofy sleeves?
5976360	5977960	He's a slave and stuff.
5977960	5979720	Do you remember the scene when you were a tooth?
5980760	5984600	Yeah, well, I was the second molar and I had a...
5989160	5994120	I was small enough that all the kids' costumes were grocery bags, paper grocery bags.
5995080	5998920	So that's how small we were, that our heads went through the upside-down grocery bag.
5998920	6000200	We were wearing them as...
6000360	6001160	Oh, my God.
6001160	6001960	That seems safe.
6001960	6003080	That seems like a safe costume.
6003080	6003480	No, no, no.
6003480	6003800	We weren't...
6003800	6004760	Put your head in this plastic bag.
6004760	6005640	No, it wasn't plastic.
6005640	6006840	Tyler, it was a plastic bag.
6006840	6007800	Yeah, yeah, yeah, but still.
6007800	6011160	There was a hole cut for the neck in the bottom of a paper bag.
6011160	6011880	Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.
6011880	6012520	Yeah, I understand.
6012520	6012840	And then our...
6012840	6013560	Yeah, sure, sure.
6013560	6015560	And then a tooth painted on the front.
6015560	6019960	And then my line was, you think you've got it bad in Caesar?
6019960	6023640	We molars grind the food for early digestion.
6025960	6027720	And I fucking belted it out.
6028360	6030120	Is that generally the line from the place?
6030120	6031080	Yes, that's truly the line.
6031080	6032920	That's been in there for that long.
6032920	6036600	Because my family came and I knew it and I was like,
6036600	6038360	I'm going to fucking steal this show.
6040120	6040760	Second molar.
6040760	6044600	And I was like, my definition of acting was like, I'm going to hit the back of the room.
6046200	6047480	What were the reviews like?
6047480	6048040	How did it go?
6049720	6051320	There was a whole mouthful of teeth.
6051320	6051560	What...
6052680	6053240	Right, right.
6053240	6054120	Okay, gotcha.
6054120	6058280	Mythologically, what character do you think that would be in the Game of Thrones universe?
6058280	6060600	Hey, little finger.
6063160	6063880	I don't know.
6063880	6065320	There's no funny answer to that.
6065320	6067080	No, I think you're right.
6067080	6068680	I think you got it right.
6071720	6072360	But I've got...
6072360	6073800	No, I am glad to hear you're wearing it.
6073800	6077400	But I'm surprised to hear that you're glad that they're adding layers.
6077400	6081800	But you're saying you're constantly under the beating sun.
6081800	6083800	So adding clothes is good.
6084840	6086120	This is something I don't understand about.
6086120	6090360	But are you saying you get to take off the skin-tight thing and throw a jacket
6090360	6093640	over your skin now, as I was saying, instead of wearing both?
6093640	6095480	Yeah, it's just one layer.
6095480	6096680	But also, I think...
6097240	6099800	I mean, I don't want to say anything too bad.
6099800	6102120	I don't want to shit on anyone.
6102120	6103800	But it's very funky.
6104440	6105080	It's a very...
6105720	6106760	It's a very...
6106760	6107640	It's a very...
6107640	6109320	It's got a kind of disco vibe to it.
6109320	6110680	Oh, I thought you meant it smelled bad.
6111560	6112600	Oh, you meant too.
6112600	6113560	Yeah, I like cheesy funky.
6113560	6115160	You mean funky like it's collecting sweater.
6115160	6116520	You mean like, Parliament funky.
6116520	6118600	Like, all right.
6119480	6120280	But you're into it.
6120280	6122120	You're like, we're looking forward to this.
6122120	6124360	Grey Worm is going to come out and that's going to be...
6124360	6124760	All right.
6125320	6126600	There's going to be a bassline.
6140680	6142840	I think we're doing ourselves a great disservice
6142840	6144600	if we don't eventually end the show
6144600	6146120	with a Grey Worm rap sequence.
6150520	6152040	Do you branch into that world?
6152040	6152520	Do you say...
6152520	6153960	What is your...
6153960	6154840	What is your...
6154840	6156440	No, I'm more of like a singer.
6156440	6157080	Yeah.
6157080	6157800	But I get...
6157800	6158520	Because I'm brown.
6158520	6159000	But you...
6159000	6161480	I get asked if I'm a rapper every day.
6161480	6162280	But you could...
6162280	6164440	That in the Wu-Tang shirt kind of, I thought.
6164440	6165240	I made some assumptions.
6165240	6166040	Yeah, I'm not.
6166040	6167080	I made some assumptions.
6167080	6167640	I feel bad.
6168840	6169400	I'm brown.
6169400	6170600	Nobody thinks I'm a rapper.
6171320	6174600	And they're like, hey, can you help me with my computer?
6178040	6180760	Also, your stage name, Raleigh Richie.
6181880	6182840	Sounds a little rapper-y.
6182840	6184120	But he sings beautifully.
6184120	6186200	It's the least rap-y.
6186200	6187640	It's from a Wes Anderson film.
6189320	6190840	You've got a beautiful singing voice.
6190840	6192200	That doesn't make it a rapper.
6192200	6193560	After we met, I listened to your music.
6193560	6194200	It's beautiful.
6194200	6194840	Oh, thanks, man.
6194840	6195320	What's like...
6195320	6196040	Let me go look at...
6196040	6197480	He sings beautifully.
6197480	6198520	What sort of style?
6198520	6200200	You remember half an hour ago?
6200200	6200760	I'm working on something.
6200760	6202600	Do you remember two hours ago when we were talking?
6202600	6203800	Give me a fucking second.
6204440	6205560	You sing beautifully.
6206920	6207880	But for sure,
6207880	6213160	Raleigh Richie can do the Rihanna bridge in my closing rap.
6215160	6219480	Jacob, what sort of style would you call your music?
6223480	6225800	Thrown punk?
6225800	6226600	No.
6226600	6227400	No, this is...
6227400	6228680	No, actually, I don't know.
6229000	6230920	I was going to become really defensive then.
6232520	6233880	I don't cluster two over.
6237480	6238040	I'm sorry.
6239320	6240040	No, I'm sorry.
6241320	6242200	Are you a crooner?
6243000	6243960	Yeah, he's a crooner.
6243960	6244440	You sing.
6245320	6247240	Yes, I crooner.
6247240	6247960	Yes, I do.
6249000	6249320	Sorry.
6250440	6251400	You're a baritone, too.
6252440	6253400	Yes, I am.
6254120	6256120	All right.
6257080	6261960	So when Dan does the world's greatest rap at the end of the show...
6262920	6263880	Which is coming soon.
6265000	6268600	Because we have to end this thing with a giant flourish.
6268600	6269000	Yeah.
6269000	6270920	Well, if I look at all these shows that are premiering,
6272280	6273800	you got your ghost balloons,
6273800	6280040	your season 14 longest running live action comedy on TV in history TV.
6280040	6280680	So I'll be there.
6280680	6281000	Thank you.
6281720	6287240	You got that movie that Camille can't shut up about?
6289800	6292440	You get your silicon people,
6293640	6295640	and you get your throne gamers.
6297720	6299800	It truly is the golden age of television.
6300680	6301960	It really is so...
6301960	6304600	Like, so we go to these HBO events,
6304600	6305800	and you guys are always there,
6305800	6307640	and you guys are like these demigods,
6307640	6310120	and we're just like fucking trolls in the basement.
6310680	6311960	How do we go talk to them?
6313640	6314840	You guys are...
6314840	6315720	Everyone seems very nice.
6315720	6317240	But I got that with you guys.
6317240	6318440	Like, oh, you.
6318440	6320360	I got that with you guys.
6320360	6321400	No, you don't.
6321400	6322120	Your silicon.
6322120	6323880	It's very nice of you.
6323880	6325000	You don't even know the name of the show.
6325000	6325560	It's fine.
6325560	6326440	You shouldn't know it.
6326440	6327400	Yes, I do.
6327400	6327880	Yes.
6328760	6330360	Isn't HBO great?
6330360	6330600	Yeah.
6331880	6332840	It's not TV.
6336440	6337320	It is a great...
6337320	6337960	I mean, you know,
6338840	6340360	we're doing some great shit.
6341560	6343720	I actually, on Sunday,
6343720	6347400	I went up to Martin Starr and just went,
6347400	6348520	Martin Starr!
6348520	6350440	And shook his hand and then walked away.
6350440	6350920	Yeah.
6350920	6351320	So...
6351880	6353800	He was like some fucking weirdo.
6353800	6354680	Said my name.
6355880	6356520	No, he didn't.
6357480	6360040	That was the first episode of Game of Thrones he's watched,
6360040	6360600	was that night.
6360600	6361320	He's never seen shit.
6361320	6362280	Yeah, he doesn't know the show.
6363720	6364600	You guys can leave.
6364600	6365240	We're just going away.
6365960	6366200	Yeah.
6367320	6368280	Work through some shit.
6368280	6369080	We should do the...
6369080	6370520	We should do the rap, right?
6371720	6372600	I think we should.
6372600	6373240	That's what we have.
6375000	6376280	We should do the rap.
6378920	6379560	I'm done.
6379560	6380040	Come on.
6384760	6385800	I'm all finished.
6387080	6388040	Let's hit the lights.
6389240	6391800	You don't get to come back from a three-year hiatus
6391800	6393320	and try to reverse comptroller.
6395960	6396600	Yes!
6397320	6398360	All drives.
6398360	6399000	All drives.
6399000	6399720	Yes!
6399720	6400200	Yes!
6401320	6402360	And because you're brown,
6402360	6403880	you might have to rap in this one, come in.
6403880	6404680	Oh, fuck no.
6405720	6407000	I really have no rhythm.
6407000	6407960	I have no rhythm.
6407960	6409160	He'll do it for me.
6409160	6409720	Maybe...
6409720	6410440	Do you sing at all?
6411160	6411880	Do I sing?
6411880	6412600	Yeah.
6412600	6413080	No.
6413080	6413400	Never?
6414120	6414520	No.
6414520	6415480	Do you sing in the shower?
6415480	6416360	Do you sing in the car?
6416360	6416760	No.
6416760	6417480	Never?
6417480	6417960	No.
6417960	6418840	You never sing?
6418840	6419160	No.
6419160	6420520	Can you fix my computer?
6420520	6425160	Yeah, probably.
6428920	6429960	Serious question, Camille.
6429960	6431000	And I'm not joking.
6431000	6432680	You don't sing to yourself ever.
6432680	6433880	You don't sing when you're alone
6433880	6435400	or in the car or scour or anything.
6435400	6436520	It's a moment of truth, man.
6436520	6437000	Be honest.
6437000	6437960	I'm not like a...
6437960	6438280	No.
6438280	6439080	It's not a rhythm.
6439080	6440520	You don't hum, whistle ever.
6440520	6441400	You don't carry a tune.
6441400	6442280	I can't whistle.
6442280	6443240	I cannot whistle.
6445240	6446840	That's me doing my best.
6446840	6447320	For real.
6447960	6448520	I swear.
6448520	6449960	But you can sing happy birthday.
6450680	6452360	Sing the first words of happy birthday.
6452360	6453320	Oh, God.
6454920	6458600	Because I'm a firm believer that everybody can sing.
6458600	6459320	Everybody can...
6459320	6460440	Come on, guys.
6460440	6460920	Let's encourage it.
6460920	6462200	He's not great at singing.
6462200	6463480	You can hear it.
6463480	6464840	Camille, sing.
6464840	6465960	On the indoor kids.
6465960	6468200	If you want to hear him sing, it's all on the internet.
6468200	6469640	He doesn't have to do it right now.
6471000	6471800	You can sing.
6471800	6472840	Everybody can sing.
6472840	6475240	This is his way of saying, I don't want to sing.
6476360	6477400	I'm not going to make you sing.
6477400	6478680	You're making me sing.
6478840	6480840	I'm pretty sure.
6481800	6483080	Then I retract that.
6483080	6485480	But I'm saying, this is ritual bullying.
6485480	6486600	This is really...
6486600	6488920	No, I'm not going to make anybody sing.
6488920	6490920	But you just sing once in a while.
6490920	6492280	You can carry a tune.
6492280	6492920	No.
6492920	6493320	For real.
6494040	6496280	Yeah, every question you've asked me, I've answered no.
6497400	6499480	But your voice is so melodic.
6499480	6502040	Don't fucking patronize me into singing.
6503240	6504520	This shit isn't going to work.
6504520	6506920	You have this gorgeous melodic, beautiful...
6506920	6507720	Okay, maybe I should.
6507720	6509320	You have a very rich timbre to your voice.
6509320	6509800	It's true.
6511320	6512440	Here, watch me sing.
6512440	6513480	I'll sing something.
6513480	6514040	All right.
6514040	6514520	Yeah.
6520040	6520520	Yeah.
6523400	6527080	I'm singing a song about being me.
6527080	6528520	I am Camille.
6530840	6531240	You see?
6536280	6537240	It's not bullying.
6538280	6539080	It's not bullying.
6539080	6541560	Sometimes people need a little bit of encouragement.
6541560	6542680	That's all that was.
6542680	6545320	Yeah, bullying is just hyper encouragement.
6548680	6550840	It's extreme encouragement.
6552280	6553240	But look at the result.
6553240	6553880	That was beautiful.
6553880	6554680	That was a touching moment.
6554680	6555720	I didn't know I had it in me.
6555720	6559160	That's why I'm so clean and thin after 43 years.
6559800	6561800	Just a lot of support around me.
6563880	6566680	I had no idea people wanted me to comb my hair
6566680	6567640	and believed I could.
6567640	6568520	All right, Dan.
6568520	6569080	Dan Harmon.
6569800	6571800	Speaking of hyper encouragement slash bullying,
6571800	6574360	it's time for us to bring this show into the station.
6574920	6575800	Take the stage again.
6575800	6576440	Grab a mic.
