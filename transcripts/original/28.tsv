0	17440	Charlotte, North Carolina, welcome.
17440	20440	Carment Town is now officially in session, everybody.
20440	22440	Oh, yeah.
22440	25480	What is this, day five, day six?
25480	26480	I have no idea.
26480	29560	We've been on tour, and it feels like we're members of the Donner Party.
29560	30560	It's wild.
30560	34480	I woke up and Spencer was gnawing on my leg.
34480	41880	Please welcome the mayor of Harmon Town to the stage, Mr. Dan Harmon.
41880	42880	Thank you.
42880	43880	Thank you very much.
43880	44880	Everybody, calm down.
44880	45880	Calm down.
45880	46880	Sorry.
46880	47880	No, it's okay.
47880	49880	I didn't mean to yell at you.
49880	57800	Well, tonight's going to be a very interesting night, I promise you that.
57800	62360	Last night in Nashville, the episode was only just being uploaded.
62360	66760	I almost hope none of you heard it.
66760	68840	Control was lost.
68840	69960	Things broke down.
69960	71340	The audience was fantastic.
71340	74600	They were wonderful.
74600	79400	My drinking was unforgivable.
79400	85300	The audience was loaded in nice and early to escape the cold, and we did Jager bombs
85300	87080	with them in the back.
87320	90320	I took the stage already pretty sloshy.
90320	93080	So I went up to the stage pretty tipsy.
93080	101640	Then about 20 minutes into it, we had a representative, self-proclaimed hillbilly come up and treat
101640	108120	us to moonshine out of a jar.
108120	113160	Then I took a sip, and then everything else was sort of a blackout until I listened to
113160	114160	the recording today.
114160	115160	I was editing it.
115240	116240	I'll tell you this.
116240	120880	I'll confide in you, Charlotte, because I'm relying on you to be a confidant tonight.
120880	125520	We're going to have a quiet, dignified, thoughtful, mature show.
125520	127460	I want to start with this confession to you.
127460	134160	As an editor of Harman Town, I have never made more shame-based edits to a Harman Town
134160	135160	recording.
135160	137400	Usually, if there's any editing of a Harman Town recording, what you're hearing is, I'll
137400	141480	just lift, like, you know, I'll go, hey, welcome to Harman Town.
141480	145760	Some lady in the back will go, how is Sucky Dick?
145760	146760	What did you say?
146760	148360	The mic won't pick her up.
148360	150840	She said she wants a Sucky Dick, Jeff.
150840	154400	And then it'll be kind of a weird, like, we'll bring her up here, and then you'll hear kind
154400	159640	of like a burp, burp, burp, burp, burp, okay, take this mic, take that mic.
159640	164440	I'll lift that stuff, so we'll just cut, you know, we'll just, a nice tight, how is Sucky
164440	165440	Dick?
165440	166440	Hey, what's your name?
166440	167440	Nancy?
168440	172840	I'll just lift things to keep the podcast listener happy.
172840	176440	But this morning in the hotel room, as I was listening to the Nashville show, I was editing
176440	179040	things because I was like, I sound like a monster.
179040	183400	I just sound like a, I don't want anyone or their mother to hear it.
183400	187920	There were some very long raps and very long songs that-
187920	192320	I don't know if any of you are Beach Boys fans, but Brian Wilson had a period following
192320	195600	that group's peak.
195600	196600	Post-Cocomo.
196600	202000	Yeah, where if you were hearing the words Brian Wilson, it was because he was just popping
202000	207600	up at some venue and just sort of like, just kind of Gary Busey-ing all over the place.
207600	210760	I became Gary Busey last night, it was uncomfortable.
210760	214120	There was a documentary crew there to film it, so when this movie comes out for five
214120	217560	dollars online, I'm sure you can watch me make an ass of myself, I'm sure that'll be
217560	218960	what the movie's about.
218960	224880	But that's where I decided that tonight is going to be, and I picked this spot because,
224880	230440	for you podcast listeners, the comedy zone here in Charlotte is, it couldn't be a better
230440	234640	place to have an undersold show.
234640	236720	It's sort of a concrete construction.
236720	241000	I think Hitler killed himself here.
241000	243440	We're in a day of the dead bunker.
243440	247000	We are absolutely safe from anything that might happen outside.
247000	249080	I don't think cell phones work down here.
249080	252360	There's a lot of concrete around us.
253360	254880	We're in our parents' basement.
254880	261760	It's time to make stained glass and get hit with belts and get to know each other.
261760	265320	And I respect you guys, and I'm coming to you on my knees.
265320	267880	Please forgive me for what happened in Nashville.
267880	270240	Please let me find a new home here in Charlotte.
270240	275600	Please let's get to know each other in an intelligent, sophisticated, mature way, Jeff.
275600	283760	I want to have a decent show, a show you could bring your parents to a little bit.
283760	287280	And I think one of the serious things that we have to talk about is this Harman Town
287280	289840	government that we're forming.
289840	295600	I think it's time to cross the threshold, Jeff, of actually getting serious about this
295600	298960	and saying, because we're going to colonize the moon or we're not.
298960	303880	In any case, I think it's time for Harman Town and its followers to say, this is who
303880	310080	we are, this is what we believe, let's separate ourselves from the United States and everything
310080	314680	else and just become a criminal organization.
314680	317800	Yeah, but what if I don't believe in government?
317800	318800	What if I don't like government?
318800	320560	Yeah, well, you shouldn't.
320560	321560	Government's bad.
321560	322680	Government's somebody telling somebody else what to do.
322680	323680	We all agree with that.
323680	326640	That's what the United States is founded on, and the principle that people telling people
326640	327960	what to do is a bad idea.
327960	332160	Then somehow we got all caught up in doing it again.
332160	338080	When the people that defend it, they have to reduce themselves to weird mental riddles
338080	339960	by going like, oh, you don't believe that?
339960	341800	Well, what if someone was stepping on a baby's head?
341800	345080	Well, I'm not in favor of stepping on a baby's head.
345080	346080	You got me.
346080	351120	Well, then you should vote for so-and-so because otherwise the baby's head doesn't step down.
351120	352240	That's silly.
352240	354280	You're stepping on a theoretical baby's head.
354280	356400	You're bullying me.
356400	360320	Everyone should be allowed to do whatever they want to do, right?
360320	362080	We all agree with that.
362080	364120	Everyone should be allowed to do whatever they want to do.
364120	369280	Then there's this problem that we run up against where what if me wanting to do whatever I
369280	373240	want to do, it interferes with someone else wanting to do whatever they want to do.
373240	378840	So tiny example, I want to smoke in this room, okay?
378840	382720	I want to light up a cigarette because that's what I want to do.
382720	387160	So then there's like a bunch of people going, I don't want to inhale your secondhand smoke.
387160	389200	Very classic example.
389200	396920	So there's got to be a way, Jeff, to create a rule, a system of thinking where we could
396920	404840	walk through that scenario in the same way and apply it to a serial killer.
404840	407280	We don't have to have 8,000 laws.
407280	412480	There's got to be a way, Jeff, to create a little logarithm.
412480	417080	I think it's a thing called courtesy, self-awareness, awareness of your surroundings and awareness
417080	419080	of the needs and desires of other people.
419080	421480	That's something that people don't have enough of, right?
421480	423840	Like where people just don't consider other people.
423840	428400	Do we have anybody here tonight that has like sort of a, well, okay.
428400	429400	This might be embarrassing.
429400	432560	I understand if you don't want to participate in this.
432560	433960	Raise your hand if you came alone.
433960	434960	Okay.
434960	435960	The whole audience?
435960	439760	There's a whole table full of people that came alone.
439760	442440	So you guys just got sat together because you're, okay, all right.
442440	444920	So all of you guys came alone.
444920	445920	Everyone look at them.
445920	446920	They all came alone.
447920	449920	But they're not leaving alone.
449920	450920	No, they're not.
450920	451920	No.
451920	452920	You're all getting laid tonight.
452920	456920	We're going to do a square dance at the end of the show.
456920	457920	Remember square dancing?
457920	458920	Did you teach?
458920	459920	No, I'm from Southern California.
459920	460920	That's not a thing.
460920	464920	But in the mid, did you guys do square dancing in your Fi Ed classes?
464920	465920	Yes.
465920	466920	Okay.
466920	467920	Yeah.
467920	472920	It was a weird thing where they took everybody and kind of forced them to touch each other.
472920	475920	It was always so that people like me could make physical contact with people.
475920	479920	With girls and like sweaty, gross hands would touch theirs.
479920	481920	Like you dosey doe and promenade.
481920	485920	And you're just being forced to touch people that would never touch you.
485920	486920	I had fancy square dancing.
486920	487920	We had cotillion.
487920	489920	Anybody have that?
489920	491920	Yeah, it's really, yeah.
491920	492920	Cotillion was weird.
492920	494920	There was a lady and she had castanets for some reason.
494920	495920	That's how she got your attention.
495920	498920	Everybody, pass that.
498920	500920	That was our thing.
500920	501920	All right.
501920	505920	Who's having the worst time tonight?
505920	506920	Okay, good.
506920	507920	We just started.
507920	508920	All right.
508920	510920	Well, no, they're all having an equally bad time.
510920	511920	All right.
511920	516920	One of you guys that came here alone, I need you to be like the secretary for tonight,
516920	519920	because we're going to make a system of laws.
519920	522920	I actually have the time and paper.
522920	523920	Okay.
523920	524920	All right.
524920	525920	Your name's Ben, right?
525920	526920	We met you before the show.
526920	530920	Ben, could you come up here and introduce yourself to the audience?
530920	533920	Ben's kind of an interesting guy.
533920	535920	I think you'll see that.
535920	536920	Sure.
536920	537920	Hi.
537920	544920	Before he told me what he did for a living, my guess was surveillance.
544920	548920	He's dressed a bit like a magician.
548920	551920	He's got a shaved head.
551920	554920	His face doesn't change expression much.
554920	557920	He could be either about to hug you or kill you.
557920	558920	Thank you.
558920	559920	Thank you.
559920	560920	I feel like Anton LaVey.
560920	561920	Anton LaVey?
561920	563920	I've gotten Lenin, too, actually.
563920	566920	Yeah, you look a little bit like Vladimir little.
566920	567920	Yeah.
567920	568920	All right.
568920	569920	Well, can you take some notes for us?
569920	574920	We're going to try to figure this out throughout the night, what our system of laws should
574920	575920	be.
575920	576920	All right.
576920	577920	Take this down.
577920	578920	Take dictation.
578920	589640	We, the people of Harmontown, blah, blah, blah, put some fancy shit in there.
589640	593280	Everybody should ever have to do anything they don't want to do.
593280	596520	Everyone should be able to do whatever they want to do.
596520	600240	If you wanted to do whatever you want to do, interferes with someone wanting to do whatever
600240	603080	they want to do, dot, dot, dot, and that's what we have to figure out.
603080	604760	We'll figure that out by the end of the night.
604760	608160	Now we were in Atlanta and somebody said, trial by death or something like that.
608160	609160	Fight to the death.
609160	611680	It doesn't really work, because if I want to punch you in the face and you don't want
611680	615280	to get punched in the face, then I get to just punch you in the face and then say, trial
615280	616280	by death.
616280	618000	And that's just bullying.
618000	619000	It doesn't work.
619360	623360	Then you just have people that want to punch people, walking up to people and punching
623360	624360	them.
624360	626520	I think the idea of making a bubble throat.
626520	627520	Yeah.
627520	628520	You don't want that.
628520	629520	Yeah.
629520	631960	You can't do a bubble throat around Dan Harmont because he comes down and it's like a sack
631960	632960	of bricks.
632960	634360	I don't think there should be a constitution.
634360	635360	How about that?
635360	639640	I think the moment you start writing down any sort of law, then that's when you're screwed.
639640	641960	You can say, are we guaranteed free speech?
641960	645360	That's the last time there is such a thing as free speech, because then for the rest
645360	650240	of time, lawyers start closing a big net around what makes free speech.
650240	653600	You'll fire in a private thing and you can't say something I heard somebody's feeling.
653600	654600	Speech is never free again.
654600	655840	I think what you're doing right now is dangerous.
655840	656840	Yeah.
656840	657840	No, it's illegal.
657840	658840	I'm a terrorist.
658840	661080	I'm declaring myself a terrorist.
661080	663760	Ben used to work for an organization to fight terrorism.
663760	664760	Oh, yeah.
664760	665760	That's right.
665760	666760	We met Ben at the bar earlier.
666760	667760	What's it called?
667760	670840	It's called the NIFA Foundation, 9-11 Finding Answers.
670840	672640	9-11 Finding Answers.
673640	678080	So it's a non-governmental agency, you said, that's dedicated to, are you going to get
678080	680520	in trouble saying what you're saying, or is someone going to kill you?
680520	682160	I don't think so.
682160	686880	I don't think anyone involved in the organization actually carries a gun in an official capacity,
686880	691760	so they'll have to get creative if they want to come after me.
691760	694360	And you're a substitute teacher now, right, Ben?
694360	695360	Yes.
695360	699120	Doesn't that explain a lot about growing up in your schools?
699120	702960	We came into the bar, and he had one headphone in, and that's why Dan thought he worked
702960	703960	in surveillance.
703960	706800	And we said, no, it's much nerdier than what you think it was.
706800	710120	It was me listening to the works of Tacitus.
710120	711120	Yes.
711120	712120	Awesome.
712120	713120	Part one of the Annals.
713120	714120	Yeah.
714120	715120	The good one.
715120	716120	Oh, yeah.
716120	720240	Part two drags a bit.
720240	721240	That's our fans.
721240	725640	It's a guy at a bar who looks like Vladimir Lenin, and he's listening to Tacitus.
725640	727040	That's awesome.
727200	729000	Nicknames for Charlotte, Jeff.
729000	731920	Want me to make one up?
731920	732920	The Queen City.
732920	737960	A little offensive.
737960	738960	Crown Town.
738960	741720	Obviously, a reference to Queen City.
741720	746160	The Hornet's Nest, ooh.
746160	747160	That's a political one.
747160	748920	The Home of NASCAR.
748920	750600	That's a nickname.
750600	751760	The Gem of the South.
751760	752760	That's adorable.
752760	754160	That goes with Queen City.
754160	756320	Why is it called Queen City?
757080	760560	I couldn't understand it.
760560	761560	Queen Charlotte.
761560	762560	Now, who was Queen Charlotte?
762560	763560	She was the queen.
763560	764560	Right?
764560	765560	Okay.
765560	767120	That's a good guess.
767120	770760	And also, wasn't Charlotte the home, or was it just North Carolina?
770760	779080	I was reading something about the only successful U.S. coup d'etat happened here in the 1860s.
779080	781760	Not in a good way, really.
781760	786080	It was like a bunch of white dudes that were pretty mad about the way things shook out
786080	790120	in the Civil War, and they just kind of took something over.
790120	794960	It was very complicated stuff that I did not have time to research over a drink.
794960	799040	I try to Wikipedia every city that we go to.
799040	800680	Incredibly boring town you have here.
800680	803720	It's very, very complicated.
803720	805640	Everything's very nuanced.
805640	810480	You have to have like a 300 IQ to understand the history of Charlotte.
810480	813800	In Atlanta, we were like, ah, there's railroads, and everyone's racist, or whatever.
813800	814800	It was fun.
814800	818520	In Nashville, you're like, oh, Elvis was invented here.
818520	822000	Charlotte, you got to really put the glasses on and roll up your sleeves.
822000	824080	You should be proud of that fact.
824080	828200	That's why we're going to have a quiet, thoughtful evening in a military bunker here at the Comedy
828200	829200	Zone.
829200	832000	Are you guys from here, or is this like a commuter town?
832000	834800	I'm definitely not from here.
834800	836320	You're not from here.
836320	837320	Where are you from?
837320	838320	Florida.
838560	841080	Florida, you have an accent that I can't place.
841080	843080	No, I grew up in Newcastle.
843080	844600	Newcastle, OK.
844600	848880	Newcastle, like the English Stephen King company?
848880	851240	Yeah, he grew up in a Stephen King company.
851240	854240	That's Castle Rock, sorry.
854240	858040	Look, I think you're making the show too dignified.
858040	859040	OK.
859040	860040	All right.
860040	861760	You want to spice it up with a...
861760	862760	I don't know.
862760	865760	You want to do a quick rap about Charlotte?
865760	866760	Yes.
866760	867760	Let's kick this shit into overdrive.
867760	868760	Yo, yo, yo, Charlotte.
868760	869760	Yo, gateway to Carolina.
869760	870760	All the mountains couldn't look finer.
870760	871760	Looking like titties going to stroke them.
871760	872760	I fucked your mama.
872760	873760	I like to poke them in the butt.
873760	874760	Fucked her in the butt.
874760	875760	Fucked your mama all the way down and up.
875760	876760	Threw her in the sky.
876760	877760	Fucked her in the eye.
877760	878760	Put my dick in her nose.
878760	896760	Fucked your mama.
897760	899760	I'm sorry, fucked your mama to death.
899760	901760	Fucked your mama till she ran out of breath.
901760	904760	Dumped her in the pool, lifted her out.
904760	905760	Fucked your mama.
905760	907760	I got that clout.
907760	908760	All right.
908760	909760	Okay, all right.
909760	910760	Thanks, guys.
910760	913760	Thanks, Charlotte.
913760	914760	Thanks.
914760	915760	Thanks.
915760	918760	It's a classy show.
918760	922760	I need like a big Masterpiece Theater armchair up here.
922760	925760	Just a shelf of books.
925760	928760	How are you holding up on this trip so far, Dan?
928760	930760	What are we, like a third of the way, fourth of the way through?
930760	931760	It's good.
931760	934760	I like all the cities we're going to, and everybody's been delightful,
934760	937760	and everywhere we go, it's just like, you know, the Harman Town fans,
937760	940760	they're all, you guys all listen to the podcast, right?
940760	946760	I'm trying to, I'm scanning the audience for people who don't.
946760	949760	I feel like I have to ask this every, because we go to these comedy clubs,
949760	952760	and I know some of the comedy clubs, like, they fill seats.
952760	957760	Is there anybody here, be honest, that just got convinced to come here
957760	960760	and then thought that you were going to be seeing Stand Up?
960760	961760	Uh-oh.
961760	962760	Okay.
962760	963760	All right.
963760	965760	I'm sorry, you guys.
965760	968760	I'm sorry.
968760	976760	Dan Harman created a television show called Community right now.
976760	980760	And now he thinks that he has a right to travel the country and stand up,
980760	985760	get drunk on stage, and have no plans, and no act to speak of.
985760	986760	Sorry.
986760	992760	But in my defense, you'd get the same from Rob Schneider.
992760	995760	He's still working off the same ten minutes from 1989, I bet you.
995760	997760	He's going to do Elvis on a fish hook,
997760	1000760	and then he's going to be talking about the government for 90.
1000760	1001760	That's not true.
1001760	1002760	Rob Schneider's here next week.
1002760	1006760	Come see him.
1006760	1010760	But I do apologize to the, by my count,
1010760	1014760	six people that were duped into coming here under the impression
1014760	1019760	that I might be like a sort of Bobby Lee figure.
1019760	1020760	I do apologize.
1020760	1022760	I could try to do Stand Up.
1022760	1025760	Give me a topic.
1025760	1026760	Hockey?
1026760	1027760	Hockey?
1027760	1029760	What is with this sport, huh?
1029760	1035760	It's certainly not for black people.
1035760	1036760	That was my bad.
1036760	1040760	You can't do a Chris Rock mic drop during somebody else's act.
1040760	1043760	For the listeners, that wasn't me dropping the mic Chris Rock style.
1043760	1047760	That was Ben, Ben, Ben dropped his mic.
1047760	1049760	And I want answers.
1049760	1051760	I mean, you got a bunch of ice, and they're out there,
1051760	1055760	and it's like, like, what are you, you're hitting a puck back and forth?
1055760	1056760	Puck?
1056760	1058760	Well, what is that, a Shakespeare reference?
1058760	1063760	All right.
1064760	1065760	Sorry.
1065760	1066760	It probably won't work.
1066760	1069760	If it was that easy, I think everybody would do it.
1069760	1070760	I apologize again.
1070760	1072760	I'll be apologizing throughout the night.
1072760	1076760	I'm certainly sorry to the city of Nashville for what we did there.
1076760	1077760	I drank too much.
1077760	1079760	I think at one point I was naked.
1079760	1083760	I'll do it tonight, too, for you guys if you want.
1083760	1087760	You wouldn't believe, like, what my body looks like.
1087760	1089760	It's covered in hair.
1089760	1090760	Sorry.
1090760	1096760	The weirdest thing about my naked body is that I'm covered shoulder to ankle
1096760	1099760	in, like, this Chewbacca coat.
1099760	1103760	But, like, it looks like I'm wearing, like, skin socks.
1103760	1105760	Like, I don't, does anyone else have that condition?
1105760	1107760	Like, I don't have any hair.
1107760	1108760	You're like a reverse hobbit.
1108760	1110760	Yeah.
1110760	1112760	Does anyone else have that happening?
1112760	1113760	Nobody.
1113760	1114760	Okay.
1114760	1115760	I don't know if, like, actually...
1115760	1116760	Actually, yeah, kind of.
1116760	1117760	Oh, yeah?
1117760	1118760	Ben?
1118760	1119760	You know it's Ben.
1119760	1127760	We, the people of Harbin Town, et cetera, et cetera, having been appalled
1127760	1132760	by the state of this nation here in this bunker where Hitler killed himself
1132760	1139760	with sound mind and body, blah, blah, blah, et cetera, make it sound fancy,
1139760	1144760	we choose to be terrorists and criminals.
1144760	1147760	You guys don't have to follow me on this if you don't want to.
1147760	1150760	You can choose to opt out on your way out.
1150760	1153760	But please buy a T-shirt.
1153760	1155760	All right, let's work the crowd, Jeff.
1155760	1156760	All right.
1156760	1158760	All right, do you want some music for this?
1158760	1160760	Yeah, just some transitional music.
1160760	1163760	Okay, let me pull something transitional up.
1168760	1170760	Working the crowd, going outside.
1170760	1172760	You thought I was on the stage, but now I'm nationwide.
1172760	1176760	I'm in your face, in the darkness, sticking mics in your face.
1176760	1177760	It's starkness.
1177760	1179760	Oh, shit, what's your name?
1179760	1180760	Trevor.
1180760	1182760	Fuck you.
1182760	1184760	Oh, shit, what's your name?
1184760	1185760	Blair.
1185760	1186760	My condolences.
1186760	1188760	Oh, shit, where are you from?
1188760	1189760	Wilmington.
1189760	1191760	How do you know when you're finished?
1191760	1196760	Whoa, get a look at this guy's hat.
1196760	1198760	Make fun of his hat.
1198760	1201760	Oh, where'd you get that hat?
1201760	1207760	Fuck you for wearing a hat.
1207760	1210760	Fuck you for wearing a hat.
1210760	1213760	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
1213760	1214760	I'm sorry.
1214760	1216760	Sorry, I ran out of music.
1216760	1217760	All right, no, no, no.
1217760	1219760	Yeah, take us out of the music.
1219760	1222760	This is not the kind of show I wanted to do.
1222760	1226760	And just so you guys know, this is Dan not being drunk.
1226760	1229760	I got out of control last night in Nashville.
1229760	1233760	I'm making up for it with a quiet, dignified show.
1233760	1234760	What's your name, ma'am?
1234760	1235760	Katie.
1235760	1236760	Katie.
1236760	1238760	Do you live here in Charlotte?
1238760	1240760	Yeah, so you didn't drive that far.
1240760	1244760	Still have your coat on in case you need to bolt.
1244760	1246760	What do you do for a living, can I ask?
1246760	1247760	I don't have a job.
1247760	1248760	Okay, all right.
1248760	1250760	How do you know when you're finished?
1250760	1252760	Blah, blah, blah.
1252760	1253760	Can we get you a job?
1253760	1254760	What do you want to do?
1254760	1256760	What do you want me to do?
1256760	1264760	I want you to rap.
1264760	1265760	Rap down.
1265760	1266760	Break, break down.
1266760	1269760	No, I'm kidding.
1269760	1272760	No, no, seriously, what would you do if you could do anything?
1272760	1273760	I want to be a TV writer.
1273760	1274760	All right, all right.
1274760	1276760	Let's give her a job writing TV.
1276760	1278760	You got a couple new shows coming up?
1278760	1279760	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1279760	1282760	I should be writing them right now.
1282760	1285760	Are you stuck in any script points that maybe she could help you out?
1285760	1287760	You could test her chops right now?
1287760	1288760	Yeah, I guess so, probably.
1288760	1289760	Would that work?
1289760	1290760	Yeah.
1290760	1292760	Do you like consulting with other people while you're writing a script?
1292760	1293760	Sure, sure, sure.
1293760	1294760	I guess so.
1294760	1295760	We could figure out something.
1295760	1296760	It was Katie?
1296760	1297760	Yes.
1297760	1298760	All right, Katie, come on up.
1298760	1300760	Let's write a TV show together.
1300760	1307760	Okay, we're going to walk around this way.
1307760	1308760	You don't have to run.
1308760	1309760	I'm sorry.
1309760	1312760	I just do it because I'm like a little baby.
1313760	1314760	Okay.
1317760	1320760	All right, most important thing, Katie, is write what you know.
1320760	1326760	Like TV executives, they're suspicious of people who actually want to pitch them ideas and stuff.
1326760	1332760	They want to hear from people who actually are talking from a place of ownership.
1332760	1337760	So if you go, when I was growing up in Puerto Rico, I had a mother that was so crazy.
1337760	1339760	And then they go, holy shit, this guy's the real deal.
1339760	1341760	We're going to have like a flavorful show.
1341760	1343760	We're going to be spicy and amazing.
1343760	1344760	That guy could be lying.
1344760	1345760	It doesn't matter.
1345760	1350760	So let's start with, were you born in Charlotte?
1350760	1351760	No.
1351760	1352760	Okay.
1352760	1353760	Where were you born?
1353760	1354760	New Orleans.
1354760	1355760	New Orleans.
1355760	1356760	So why did you come to Charlotte?
1356760	1357760	My family brought me.
1357760	1358760	Okay.
1358760	1359760	So it's like a kidnapping.
1359760	1362760	You could say that.
1362760	1365760	How old were you when your family brought you to Charlotte?
1365760	1366760	A little.
1366760	1367760	Me too.
1367760	1368760	Okay.
1368760	1369760	Is that mic on, Katie?
1369760	1370760	What?
1370760	1371760	Check.
1371760	1372760	Check.
1372760	1373760	Check.
1373760	1374760	Okay.
1374760	1375760	I'll speak louder.
1375760	1376760	Okay.
1376760	1377760	Great.
1377760	1378760	Okay.
1378760	1381760	So when you were two years old, your parents came from New Orleans to Charlotte.
1381760	1382760	Yes.
1382760	1383760	Why?
1383760	1384760	Because your dad's a child?
1384760	1385760	Whatever.
1385760	1386760	It was what?
1386760	1387760	Is it something to do with your dad's work?
1387760	1388760	No.
1388760	1391760	I think we just had to get out kind of thing.
1391760	1393760	I think we had family here.
1393760	1395760	So we had to come here.
1395760	1396760	Okay.
1396760	1397760	I was a child.
1397760	1398760	It wasn't explained to me.
1398760	1399760	I was just putting the car and go.
1399760	1400760	All right.
1400760	1401760	Well, let's...
1401760	1402760	That sounds like a good show.
1402760	1403760	Yeah.
1403760	1404760	I'd watch that.
1404760	1405760	Let me tell you.
1405760	1407760	I call it child abduction.
1407760	1409760	Let's brainstorm.
1409760	1411760	Take a seat for a second, Katie.
1411760	1415760	Let me just workshop like a first scene from a show about your life.
1415760	1416760	Yeah.
1416760	1417760	I'm making this up as I go.
1417760	1418760	Yeah.
1418760	1419760	Go ahead.
1419760	1420760	I'm sorry.
1420760	1421760	No, no.
1421760	1422760	You can keep the mic.
1422760	1423760	It's yours to keep.
1423760	1426760	Everybody here gets to take something from the comedy club tonight.
1426760	1427760	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1427760	1428760	We're giving everything away.
1428760	1430760	Yeah, you all get to keep your chair.
1430760	1433760	There's like 500 empty chairs we're going to be giving away.
1433760	1434760	Yeah.
1434760	1435760	Each of you get 50.
1435760	1437760	It's a comedy zone chair giveaway night.
1437760	1438760	All right.
1438760	1439760	Jeff, would you...
1439760	1441760	You're a professional improviser.
1441760	1444760	Would you do the first scene of the Katie pilot?
1444760	1445760	Is this a cold open?
1445760	1446760	Yeah, yeah.
1446760	1447760	Okay.
1452760	1453760	Katie.
1453760	1454760	Your mother's dead.
1454760	1455760	We're leaving.
1456760	1457760	Don't ask any questions.
1457760	1458760	Smash cut to the car.
1459760	1462760	Katie was born in New Orleans.
1462760	1464760	Now she's on the run to Charlotte.
1464760	1466760	She doesn't know why.
1469760	1470760	Dad, where are we going?
1470760	1472760	I got some terrible news for you.
1472760	1473760	We're both werewolves.
1475760	1476760	But I'm two.
1476760	1477760	No.
1477760	1481760	New Orleans was going to build the world's biggest moon,
1481760	1483760	and we would be werewolves all the time.
1483760	1484760	We're going to...
1484760	1485760	We have to move north.
1486760	1488760	We have to get away from the moon, honey.
1488760	1492760	Meanwhile, at the New Orleans government anti-werewolf facility...
1499760	1501760	Agent Henderson, reporting for duty, sir.
1501760	1503760	You're late, Henderson.
1503760	1506760	That's because I go by the phases of the moon.
1508760	1510760	The scheme of yours to create a larger moon
1510760	1512760	to out all of New Orleans's werewolves
1512760	1514760	is going to cost us a pretty penny.
1514760	1516760	Sir, with all due respect...
1516760	1518760	I want you off of this moon case.
1520760	1523760	You're dismissing me from this unit that I created?
1523760	1526760	You have exactly 12 episodes to catch Katie and her father
1526760	1528760	before they make it to Charlotte
1528760	1531760	and create a werewolf colony up there.
1531760	1534760	Then I'm going to do it my own way.
1535760	1537760	Gil Gerard is...
1538760	1539760	Agent Henderson.
1539760	1540760	Henderson?
1540760	1541760	Yes.
1541760	1542760	I don't like you, but I like your methods.
1542760	1544760	Actually, no, I don't like either of them.
1544760	1545760	I don't like you or your methods,
1545760	1548760	but I like the fact that you sometimes get results.
1549760	1551760	I want those werewolves back.
1551760	1552760	Well, I'm going to get them,
1552760	1555760	and I'll show everybody in this whole government facility.
1555760	1557760	I'm a man's man usually,
1557760	1558760	but when it comes to these situations,
1558760	1560760	I get a little cry, baby-ish.
1561760	1562760	Wow.
1562760	1565760	What a complicated, richly developed character that was.
1566760	1568760	You have too many doors.
1570760	1571760	Three doors.
1571760	1574760	And a comfort suite just outside of Charlotte.
1575760	1577760	In the news today,
1577760	1580760	New Orleans had a gas leak.
1581760	1582760	Dad, it says New Orleans had a...
1582760	1583760	Oh, no!
1583760	1584760	Oh!
1587760	1588760	Run!
1588760	1590760	Run, Katie!
1590760	1592760	The moon is following us.
1592760	1596760	I'll find you in another episode.
1596760	1598760	I could have tucked myself in a crib
1598760	1600760	and tipped it into a river.
1602760	1605760	I've got to get away from that moon.
1605760	1606760	Say, little girl,
1606760	1609760	what are you doing in a river at night all alone?
1609760	1611760	Oh, Italian gondolier.
1613760	1616760	My daddy got werewolfed by the moon.
1616760	1620760	The Charlotte River is no place for a little lady like yourself.
1620760	1622760	I don't know what to think no more.
1622760	1627760	You've got a strangely, ethnically ambiguous mentor to deal with now.
1627760	1630760	I'll show you how to survive.
1630760	1632760	The Charlotte way.
1633760	1635760	I've got to tell you something, though.
1635760	1636760	What's your name?
1636760	1637760	Samantha.
1638760	1640760	I've got to tell you, Samantha,
1640760	1641760	I'm a werewolf.
1642760	1644760	We don't judge around here.
1644760	1646760	We're not like those assholes in Atlanta.
1648760	1652760	Montage of Katie learning to hone her werewolf abilities
1652760	1655760	through Samantha's weird multi-ethnic tutelage.
1660760	1667760	Rawr! Rawr! Rawr! Rawr! Rawr! Rawr! Rawr!
1667760	1673760	Over the years, she grows from a toddler to a newbile adolescent.
1673760	1677760	Katie, I don't have much longer to live.
1677760	1682760	I feel that I did everything I could for you to turn you into a woman werewolf.
1682760	1684760	But I'm just getting sexy.
1685760	1687760	I know, but I can't always be here for you.
1687760	1690760	I'll be involved in later episodes via voiceover.
1691760	1693760	I guess that's cool.
1694760	1696760	It could use punch-up.
1697760	1701760	Well, I'm going back to Charlotte.
1701760	1702760	Wait, no, I'm sorry.
1702760	1704760	What? Did you hear that?
1707760	1708760	No!
1709760	1711760	Werewolf hunting ninjas!
1712760	1714760	I'm going back to New Orleans!
1714760	1716760	And that's the end of the pilot, right?
1716760	1718760	She goes back to New Orleans.
1718760	1719760	So you went to Charlotte.
1719760	1721760	That's probably not how it worked, though, right?
1721760	1722760	No.
1723760	1726760	You're saying that wasn't an accurate depiction of your childhood?
1726760	1728760	It was close, but...
1728760	1729760	You are a werewolf?
1730760	1732760	That's none of your business.
1733760	1734760	Wow.
1734760	1735760	All right.
1735760	1740760	Well, thank you, Katie, for helping us make that pilot.
1741760	1745760	I still feel like we haven't really gotten you any work as a TV writer.
1746760	1751760	In my urgency to entertain the audience, I sort of forgot that goal.
1752760	1754760	Write what you know.
1756760	1757760	Write what you know.
1757760	1758760	Yeah.
1759760	1760760	What do you know?
1761760	1764760	Obviously, I know werewolves, and I don't know.
1764760	1766760	I don't know. I'm just trying to...
1766760	1767760	Is that how you wrote Community?
1767760	1769760	Because you went to Community College for a while, right?
1769760	1770760	Was that where that came from?
1770760	1771760	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1772760	1773760	Yeah.
1773760	1777760	So my next pilot's going to be about a guy that has no idea what he's doing,
1778760	1782760	and just wanders around, being sad, drinking a lot,
1783760	1786760	and doing shows in concrete rooms.
1788760	1796760	Okay, so if this were a zombie attack, who would be our leader?
1796760	1798760	Everybody point at somebody immediately.
1798760	1799760	One, two, three. Point.
1800760	1803760	A lot of people point at the English guy.
1803760	1806760	Well, the guys that came alone pointed at me.
1807760	1809760	Then there's some people pointing at this guy in the front,
1809760	1810760	and then this guy.
1810760	1813760	This guy looks like he's pretty tough.
1813760	1815760	He's got tattoos, he's got a bald head.
1815760	1817760	What's your name?
1817760	1818760	What's your name?
1818760	1819760	John.
1819760	1821760	John? Senna. You a big guy?
1823760	1824760	Yeah, he's the one.
1824760	1825760	Yeah.
1826760	1829760	He's got a little tattoo showing him from underneath his sleeves.
1829760	1832760	I think that he speaks larger tattoos underneath that shirt.
1832760	1834760	John, take your shirt off.
1836760	1839760	Ben, what do we got on the Constitution of Harmontown?
1839760	1841760	Read back what we have so far, Ben.
1842760	1846760	It's mostly interesting pitches for Katie's first TV show,
1846760	1849760	and zombie emergency leadership protocols.
1850760	1853760	But also, people should be allowed to do whatever they want to do, right?
1854760	1857760	Everybody should, drunken ramblings,
1857760	1860760	nobody should do what they don't want to do.
1862760	1864760	Appalled by the state of this nation,
1864760	1866760	we pledge to become criminals.
1866760	1868760	Yes, okay, good.
1868760	1871760	We'll figure it out, we'll narrow it down before we leave Charlotte.
1871760	1872760	And terrorists.
1872760	1874760	Right, terrorists, something about terrorists.
1874760	1875760	And terrorists.
1875760	1878760	Who's the most patriotic person in the audience?
1878760	1879760	You are?
1880760	1881760	The guy from Newcastle.
1881760	1884760	Are you patriotic about your American citizenship
1884760	1886760	or about your British heritage?
1886760	1889760	It's actually born here, so I'm as American as you are.
1889760	1893760	You have such a pronounced Newcastle accent, though.
1894760	1897760	You were born here, and you still have your parents, or what?
1897760	1900760	We moved to Newcastle when I was like six months old.
1900760	1903760	So you were born an American, and you lived there.
1903760	1904760	I got you.
1904760	1905760	I see.
1906760	1908760	I'm a charming vampire.
1909760	1910760	What about you?
1910760	1911760	He's a patriot.
1911760	1913760	Can you come up here for a second?
1914760	1916760	We don't bully anybody at Harman Town.
1916760	1918760	Here, take Ben's mic.
1918760	1919760	Fuck that guy.
1921760	1922760	I was actually talking to Ben before the show.
1922760	1923760	We went to high school together.
1923760	1924760	No.
1924760	1925760	Didn't fucking know it.
1925760	1926760	You're kidding, really?
1926760	1927760	No.
1927760	1928760	What high school?
1928760	1929760	Clover High School.
1929760	1930760	Clover High School.
1930760	1932760	The town with love in the middle,
1932760	1934760	where the only culture is agriculture.
1934760	1937760	What was the Clover High School football team?
1938760	1939760	The Blue Eagles.
1940760	1941760	The Blue Eagles?
1941760	1943760	Weird because they're clovers, but they...
1943760	1945760	The eagle is what makes my patriotism.
1945760	1946760	You just have to go lateral and just go,
1946760	1949760	fuck it, we're worms, or a thing,
1949760	1950760	because we can't be clovers.
1950760	1951760	It's too obvious.
1952760	1954760	All right, so you're a patriot.
1954760	1956760	Are you like a conservative?
1956760	1957760	Would you call yourself a right wing?
1957760	1958760	Fuck no.
1958760	1959760	Oh, okay.
1959760	1960760	Don't be fooled because I look like Mitt Romney's son.
1960760	1961760	All right.
1963760	1966760	So you're a liberal, as probably a lot of Harman Town
1966760	1968760	listeners, but you're an America lover.
1968760	1969760	You love America.
1969760	1970760	I do.
1970760	1971760	Yeah.
1971760	1972760	Why don't you marry it?
1973760	1974760	Because...
1974760	1975760	I don't know.
1975760	1977760	They don't allow gay marriages in North Carolina.
1977760	1979760	And America's a dude.
1979760	1980760	We know that for sure.
1980760	1981760	Presumably, yeah.
1981760	1983760	Because it's got Florida hanging down like a...
1988760	1989760	All right.
1989760	1990760	So you're a patriot.
1990760	1995760	So how can you help refine my constitution,
1995760	1996760	amend it?
1996760	1999760	Like, okay, if two people want to do whatever they want to do
1999760	2001760	and it interferes...
2001760	2005760	If I want to smoke a cigarette and you don't want to breathe
2005760	2008760	my secondhand smoke, how do we resolve this?
2008760	2010760	I keep going back to Lord of the Flies.
2010760	2011760	I mean, you shouldn't just be like,
2011760	2013760	sucks your ass more, piggy.
2013760	2015760	We got to figure something out so we don't end up
2015760	2016760	like Lord of the Flies.
2016760	2018760	I mean, do you want the conch?
2018760	2019760	Should we pass that around?
2019760	2020760	Well, I've had the conch.
2020760	2023760	I'm trying to pass it around, yeah.
2023760	2026760	I mean, the problem is human courtesy has just gone
2026760	2027760	out the window, so...
2027760	2028760	Right.
2028760	2031760	We don't think that people are important anymore.
2031760	2032760	Am I right?
2032760	2033760	What's your name?
2033760	2034760	Did I get your name?
2034760	2035760	No, Nathan.
2035760	2036760	Nathan, okay.
2036760	2038760	Human courtesy has gone out the window.
2038760	2041760	We're not starting with the idea that people are
2041760	2042760	the most important thing.
2042760	2045760	Like, you know, I do it, too.
2045760	2047760	Like, if there's dudes, like, sitting on the street,
2047760	2048760	like, you know, you step over them.
2048760	2050760	You've got shit to do.
2050760	2052760	Like, I'm not going to be the first guy to stop
2052760	2054760	and go, like, okay, I'm not going to work today.
2054760	2055760	Like, hey, get up.
2055760	2056760	Let's get you some soup.
2056760	2057760	It's...
2057760	2059760	Then I'm going to get fired, and I'll be laying
2059760	2061760	next to him, and then, like, everyone's afraid
2061760	2062760	of that happening.
2062760	2065760	So we have to form a new society where you go,
2065760	2068760	like, okay, there's a guy laying in the street.
2068760	2069760	Everyone stop.
2069760	2070760	Stop it.
2070760	2072760	Like, everyone stop what they're doing.
2072760	2074760	But in order to do that, you have to kind of, like,
2074760	2076760	extract yourself from this machine that we got
2076760	2078760	going on, right?
2078760	2079760	It's not a question, I guess.
2079760	2080760	No.
2080760	2082760	It should be a people-first thing, but we don't
2082760	2084760	care about that, because we just don't.
2084760	2086760	And it's not how we got where we are.
2086760	2090760	I mean, we built a country on largely unpaid
2090760	2091760	physical labor.
2091760	2094760	Like, we couldn't afford to care about people.
2094760	2097760	We took over the world by, like, not giving a shit
2097760	2098760	about people.
2098760	2101760	So, you know, you can't stand here on stage as a
2101760	2104760	big, fat, rich asshole and say, let's start caring
2104760	2105760	about each other.
2105760	2107760	This is kind of hypocritical, isn't it?
2107760	2108760	Yeah.
2108760	2109760	Yeah.
2109760	2111760	So, what the fuck am I talking about?
2111760	2112760	I don't know.
2112760	2113760	I mean...
2113760	2115760	How do we punish me for my insolence?
2115760	2116760	I'm an asshole.
2116760	2117760	I'm an idiot.
2117760	2118760	Like, how do we...
2118760	2119760	Do not.
2119760	2120760	You really are too hard on yourself, man.
2120760	2121760	Oh, okay.
2121760	2122760	Well, how do we punish me for that?
2122760	2123760	We shouldn't punish you.
2123760	2125760	I think if we punish you, that's the problem.
2125760	2126760	We can't punish you.
2126760	2128760	I mean, we just need to...
2128760	2129760	I don't know.
2129760	2130760	Hug it out.
2130760	2131760	Hug it out, yeah.
2131760	2132760	I mean, connect you.
2132760	2134760	I think you're pretty well connected.
2134760	2136760	I mean, you're one of the more generous people.
2136760	2138760	Like, you have the courtesy to respond to your
2138760	2141760	fans via Twitter and Reddit and all that shit.
2141760	2142760	I do give a lot.
2142760	2143760	I give a lot.
2150760	2152760	I give a lot...
2155760	2157760	to you.
2159760	2161760	You're welcome.
2163760	2165760	You and you.
2166760	2169760	Every time I see...
2171760	2173760	something...
2174760	2179760	I try to figure out how I can give myself to it.
2182760	2186760	But I get caught up in...
2187760	2188760	songwriting.
2190760	2192760	Good. Okay, that's a good song.
2193760	2194760	You really do give a lot.
2194760	2195760	Yeah.
2196760	2197760	No, please.
2197760	2198760	You really...
2198760	2201760	Let me give you the right to not applaud that.
2202760	2203760	I'm very generous.
2203760	2205760	I'm a very generous person.
2205760	2206760	Rap break.
2206760	2209760	Oh, shit.
2214760	2215760	Nathan.
2215760	2216760	Dan.
2217760	2218760	I thought your mama...
2218760	2220760	That ain't no lie.
2220760	2223760	I thought your mama like Jim in American Pie.
2223760	2224760	Yo.
2225760	2227760	I thought your mama in the butt.
2227760	2230760	I thought your mama said, what, what?
2231760	2232760	I thought your mama.
2232760	2233760	That's what I'm talking about.
2233760	2236760	I thought you were in the back so hard, Dave Matthews came out.
2236760	2237760	Whoa!
2240760	2241760	That one was legit.
2242760	2243760	All right, Nathan.
2243760	2244760	Thank you.
2244760	2245760	Thank you very much.
2245760	2246760	Thank you.
2246760	2248760	Give me both microphones.
2248760	2249760	Wow.
2249760	2250760	You did good.
2250760	2253760	What a deep reservoir of talent out in the audience today.
2253760	2254760	Charlotte.
2254760	2258760	That's why they call Charlotte the Paris of North Carolina.
2259760	2261760	It's the gem of the south.
2261760	2262760	What was your name again?
2262760	2263760	I'm sorry.
2263760	2264760	Nathan.
2264760	2265760	That was Nathan.
2265760	2266760	Nathan, yeah.
2266760	2269760	Nathan, you'll have to sign a release form so we can sell that on CD.
2269760	2272760	Nathan, the patriotic mama fucker.
2274760	2276760	What's going on here?
2276760	2279760	I was just seeing if this would make me extra powerful.
2281760	2287760	Ben, tell us a story about somebody pooping their pants in your class or something.
2288760	2291760	What's the weirdest thing that happened when you were a substitute teaching a class?
2292760	2293760	Weirdest thing.
2295760	2297760	Just a random story.
2297760	2299760	Some girl puked in her purse.
2300760	2302760	Some kid took a crap.
2302760	2305760	I can tell you something that happened at one of the schools I do substitute at.
2305760	2308760	At the school me and Nathan both went to high school at.
2309760	2310760	Clover High School.
2311760	2316760	According to Coach Roach, because we can't hire actual social studies teachers.
2316760	2317760	Wait, Coach Roach?
2317760	2318760	Coach Roach.
2318760	2319760	That's awesome.
2319760	2324760	Yeah, we live in South Carolina.
2324760	2331760	We can't afford to hire actual social studies, science teachers, per se.
2331760	2337760	So we hire athletic coaches to cover the social studies and most of the cultural stuff.
2337760	2343760	Coach Roach taught a certain slant on American history.
2347760	2350760	According to him, he was teaching a class.
2351760	2353760	It was standardized testing.
2354760	2363760	Apparently, one of the female students sat through the entire test and then asked to be let out.
2364760	2366760	He said, yeah, fine, if you're done.
2366760	2367760	And she said she was done.
2367760	2368760	So she started to go.
2368760	2375760	And she was moving very carefully, just kind of kind of shuffling her feet one together.
2375760	2378760	And she was almost to the door.
2378760	2379760	She had almost made it.
2379760	2387760	It was almost home safe when a turd falls right about there, right behind her.
2387760	2389760	He's pointing at the stage.
2390760	2392760	It falls right about there.
2395760	2396760	That's it, right?
2397760	2399760	That's the story I wanted.
2399760	2401760	The story about a turd falling on your passenger.
2401760	2404760	So Coach Roach wasn't the bad guy in the story.
2404760	2405760	I don't know.
2405760	2407760	That was going a very different direction.
2407760	2410760	Yeah, I thought you said he taught a very specific type of history.
2410760	2412760	Did you teach turd history?
2413760	2415760	Was he just really racist?
2416760	2419760	Well, Clover High School is the kind of high school
2419760	2425760	where you learn that FDR deliberately kept the fleet in Pearl Harbor
2425760	2429760	so that the Japanese would bomb it so that we could go into World War II.
2430760	2431760	Again, South Carolina.
2432760	2433760	South Carolina.
2434760	2436760	Oh, yeah, because it was so different.
2437760	2442760	Did you know, Jeff, that North Carolina did not secede from the Union.
2442760	2446760	We were in Tennessee, and we were talking about how Tennessee was supposed to...
2446760	2450760	There's some contention there of who was the last, which was the last state,
2450760	2452760	because it happened within days of each other.
2452760	2456760	But what we do know is that North Carolina did not leave the Union
2456760	2459760	until Abraham Lincoln asked them to attack South Carolina.
2460760	2463760	That's kind of an awkward situation.
2463760	2465760	I guess that would be a deal-breaker for me, too.
2465760	2470760	If there had been a North and South Wisconsin, I would have not wanted to.
2471760	2473760	Do we have any racists in the audience?
2474760	2476760	Anybody racist?
2477760	2479760	It would be weird if there was somebody that was like,
2479760	2482760	I'm racist, and came up and wanted to talk about it.
2482760	2484760	I don't know how we'd handle that.
2485760	2488760	We've been having a complicated time of things.
2488760	2491760	We're these Yankee Doodles, whatever you call us,
2491760	2493760	and we're coming through the South.
2493760	2498760	Obviously, you guys are going to tend to be progressive, like liberal.
2498760	2504760	It's not like my crowd is the tractor pulling a crowd, necessarily.
2504760	2508760	Nothing against anybody that wants to pull a tractor anywhere.
2508760	2511760	I'm not saying that at all. I'm not an elitist.
2511760	2514760	You don't pull a tractor. Tractors pull things.
2514760	2517760	Well, they call them tractor pulls. Get your shit together.
2521760	2525760	It's weird when we start talking about the racial stuff and the history of stuff.
2525760	2531760	There's this swirl of weird ... It's difficult to talk about down here
2531760	2537760	because people feel a compulsion to compensate for the history and say,
2537760	2540760	well, that's not who we are anymore.
2541760	2545760	I don't know what my point is. I don't have one.
2545760	2547760	My point is I don't have a point.
2547760	2549760	You know Hitler killed himself down here.
2550760	2552760	This is where Hitler died.
2552760	2554760	He just got tired of being Hitler.
2555760	2559760	He wrote his final diary entry.
2559760	2562760	Dear diary, still Hitler.
2563760	2566760	I can hear the war ending above me.
2566760	2569760	Not much use for old Hitler anymore.
2570760	2573760	I guess I'll just tuck it in.
2573760	2577760	Is it true that he tried the poison on his dog first?
2577760	2578760	His dog?
2578760	2580760	Yeah, he had a dog and he had the cyanide capsule
2580760	2583760	and he gave it to his dog to make sure it was the real McCoy.
2584760	2586760	He killed old Blondie first before he had it.
2586760	2588760	His dog's name was Blondie.
2588760	2591760	Do you think his dog had a little dog mustache?
2593760	2595760	Do you think Hitler's car had a little mustache on it?
2595760	2597760	Do you think his pencils and things?
2597760	2600760	He did give the world one lasting gift, though.
2600760	2602760	Because of that funny mustache,
2602760	2604760	any time anybody hates the current president,
2604760	2608760	all you've got to do is drop on the bun on George Bush or on Obama
2608760	2610760	and he really made you point.
2611760	2613760	Yeah, Obama Hitler.
2614760	2615760	Obama.
2616760	2617760	Do you like Obama?
2617760	2619760	I've got a few things to rap about him.
2628760	2630760	Yo, Obama rap.
2630760	2633760	Hey Obama, I fucked your mama. That's it.
2637760	2638760	Thank you.
2638760	2639760	Wow.
2640760	2641760	Well done.
2643760	2645760	That was biting social commentary.
2647760	2650760	If I invite the American government to come down here
2650760	2654760	and seize this bunker, if they don't like what they're hearing,
2654760	2656760	we'll be well out of here.
2658760	2660760	Rob Schneider will be doing his act in this.
2661760	2665760	So SWAT teams will come in, haul him off to Guantanamo.
2665760	2668760	Right now, you could edit together a version of what we've done
2668760	2671760	so far and make a case that you're a bad guy.
2671760	2672760	Bad citizen, for sure.
2672760	2674760	You hate the government. You want to be a terrorist.
2674760	2676760	You try to fuck the president's mama.
2676760	2677760	I mean, I don't want to be a terrorist.
2677760	2680760	I don't want to blow anything up. That's bad.
2681760	2684760	I feel like I'm protesting too much.
2684760	2687760	I don't think you should ever have to say that.
2687760	2689760	I don't want to blow anything up.
2690760	2692760	I just hype-bombed when I was a kid.
2692760	2693760	Yeah.
2693760	2694760	So you did too?
2694760	2695760	Yeah.
2695760	2696760	Oh yeah.
2697760	2699760	You got too proud of that, right?
2699760	2700760	I knew it for a living.
2700760	2703760	My friend Matt Gorley is on the Super Ego podcast.
2703760	2705760	We were friends in junior high school.
2705760	2710760	He had replica guns, like actual working looking fired blanks,
2710760	2713760	like Lugers and Walthers and stuff like that.
2713760	2716760	We'd walk into the Whitwood Mall in Whittier, California
2716760	2718760	with guns in our belts.
2718760	2720760	They really looked like the real thing
2720760	2723760	because they basically wore it without the firing pin or something like that.
2723760	2725760	And we made bombs and stuff like that.
2725760	2727760	We were terrible, terrible people.
2727760	2729760	We would be doing a lot of time now.
2729760	2732760	Actually detectives came to our school
2732760	2736760	and plainclothes detectives pulled me out for a bomb threat
2736760	2740760	because I drew some girl that was a junior parked and senior parking.
2740760	2742760	So Matt and I drew a picture of her car exploding
2742760	2745760	and a soccer ball flying out because she played soccer.
2745760	2751760	And the fucking LAPD detectives came because it's a terrorist threat.
2751760	2756760	I remember my friend Dan Ramstack and I made a...
2756760	2757760	Ramstack.
2757760	2760760	We figured out how to make lights blink with batteries
2760760	2762760	and we took electrical tape and wrapped around.
2762760	2764760	We made this thing that had blinking lights on them
2764760	2770760	and we taped it to our neighbor's front screen door and just ran away.
2770760	2772760	And I don't know what we were thinking.
2772760	2773760	I don't think we thought...
2773760	2775760	We weren't trying to say this is a bomb.
2775760	2778760	We thought maybe they would think it was a robot or something.
2778760	2783760	But the fucking bomb squad showed up because...
2783760	2784760	I had a crush on the girl.
2784760	2786760	This is how I expressed it.
2786760	2789760	But he showed up and looked at it and went like,
2789760	2791760	okay, all right, 911.
2791760	2794760	And then there were just guys in white pajamas running around
2794760	2797760	diffusing this Christmas light.
2797760	2798760	That was before 9-11, Jeff.
2798760	2801760	Everything changed in 9-11.
2801760	2802760	I don't know if you guys knew that.
2802760	2805760	Everything changed in 9-11.
2805760	2807760	Right, Ben?
2807760	2809760	So they kept telling me when I worked for that place.
2809760	2811760	And then they downsized you.
2811760	2812760	Yes.
2812760	2815760	Now you're teaching kids how to roll turds out of their pants.
2815760	2818760	You used to be America's first line of defense
2818760	2821760	against more 9-11s happening.
2821760	2825760	Against chiefly 18 and 19-year-olds from Damascus, apparently.
2825760	2826760	Right.
2826760	2827760	I used to give...
2827760	2829760	Me and my friends were terrible people.
2829760	2831760	We used to give substitute teachers a lot of shit.
2831760	2833760	But you seem like a pretty intimidating guy.
2833760	2836760	I don't know if I would mess with you.
2837760	2840760	The way it usually goes is they come in
2840760	2842760	and they're being little shits because they're teenagers.
2842760	2843760	Right?
2843760	2849760	And then it takes one good excuse me.
2849760	2851760	Can you give us an example?
2851760	2852760	That wasn't an example, right?
2852760	2853760	No, that was not an example.
2853760	2854760	Really?
2854760	2855760	Here, let me...
2855760	2856760	I'll fuck around as a kid.
2856760	2858760	Can you make this your chalkboard like here
2858760	2861760	and I'll be in the back of the class?
2861760	2863760	All right.
2863760	2865760	Shit, fuck school, fuck education.
2866760	2869760	All I care about is two plus pussy.
2871760	2873760	Donald, we're in class.
2873760	2875760	No, I demand you misbehave like me.
2875760	2877760	It's peer pressure.
2877760	2879760	All right, fuck you.
2879760	2880760	Fuck you, fuck everybody.
2880760	2882760	Excuse me.
2885760	2886760	There's my fucking mic drop.
2888760	2889760	Excuse me.
2892760	2894760	Jeff Maimed walking away, pooping his pants,
2894760	2896760	or we're having a lot more fun in Charlotte
2896760	2898760	than you can hear on the podcast.
2898760	2900760	You really have to feel it.
2900760	2902760	All right, second episode of Katie's CW show
2902760	2904760	about werewolves in New Orleans.
2908760	2911760	Episode two, what's the title?
2911760	2913760	Somebody say a noun.
2914760	2915760	Umbrella.
2915760	2916760	Umbrella.
2916760	2918760	Episode two, umbrella.
2919760	2922760	A nubile adolescent, Katie,
2922760	2925760	walks down the halls of New Orleans High School.
2929760	2931760	Excuse me.
2931760	2933760	Bump into people much?
2933760	2935760	Sorry, I was on the way to football practice.
2935760	2937760	You need to learn some mans.
2937760	2940760	That's Joss Whedon talk for manners.
2943760	2945760	Wait, aren't you that werewolf girl?
2945760	2947760	Shut the fuck up.
2947760	2948760	Everybody knows.
2948760	2949760	Shut up.
2949760	2951760	What are you going to do, eat my chickens at night?
2951760	2952760	Shut up.
2952760	2953760	It's a metaphor.
2953760	2956760	Chicken lover, werewolf lady.
2956760	2959760	It's such an apt metaphor for my period.
2963760	2965760	I'm going to the only coffee shop
2965760	2969760	where I feel okay to be me.
2969760	2972760	I'll have a coffee because I'm 16.
2974760	2975760	Hello, Katie.
2977760	2979760	The ghost of Samantha.
2979760	2985760	After I died, I became a barista at this coffee place.
2985760	2988760	Was you like a haunted cappuccino?
2991760	2993760	This is crazy.
2993760	2995760	Listen, if anybody starts teasing you,
2995760	2996760	you remember what I taught you.
2996760	2999760	You got to be who you are, Katie.
2999760	3000760	Oh, this came for you.
3000760	3002760	It's a letter.
3002760	3005760	I don't know why it comes to the coffee place.
3006760	3008760	Follow the umbrella?
3011760	3013760	I got to get back to work.
3014760	3015760	She's really working.
3015760	3017760	I'm in the weeds, Katie.
3017760	3019760	It's slammed in here right now.
3019760	3022760	Okay, well, I'm going to go to this return address
3022760	3024760	and see if I can track down.
3024760	3026760	It's $3.55 for the cappuccino.
3026760	3027760	Shit.
3027760	3028760	God damn it.
3028760	3029760	There.
3029760	3030760	I was your mentor.
3030760	3032760	Take advantage of me like an asshole.
3032760	3035760	Two, three, one, pickle, boulevard.
3038760	3040760	Knocking on the door.
3043760	3045760	Action, set piece.
3056760	3059760	Got your metal shin guards on, I see.
3060760	3062760	The sword's meaningless and...
3064760	3065760	Knock, knock.
3065760	3066760	Who's there?
3066760	3067760	Wolf woman.
3072760	3075760	CG shot of me flying through the air.
3075760	3077760	Close the umbrella.
3077760	3083760	The giant umbrella above us closes to reveal a moon that's red
3083760	3086760	instead of white, which is like kryptonite for a werewolf.
3089760	3092760	Oh, it's still a metaphor for my period.
3094760	3096760	I'm powerless.
3097760	3099760	Who are you?
3099760	3104760	I am Professor Pan-Dolfo.
3105760	3108760	You see, you've been living under a giant sky umbrella
3108760	3110760	for the last seven months,
3110760	3113760	not knowing that we've turned the moon red.
3114760	3116760	All of your kind will be extinct.
3117760	3118760	No.
3118760	3120760	Commercial break.
3120760	3122760	Gold bond powder.
3124760	3126760	It's the best powder ever.
3126760	3129760	Sorry, sorry, he bailed on that commercial.
3129760	3131760	You deserve a full commercial.
3131760	3133760	Let's do the gold bond counter commercial.
3133760	3134760	What was the last line?
3134760	3137760	Living under the moon is red,
3137760	3139760	and all your kind will be extinct.
3139760	3140760	No.
3140760	3142760	Dear balls itch.
3143760	3144760	Yes.
3144760	3145760	Try gold bond powder.
3145760	3146760	All right.
3147760	3149760	Holy shit, they don't itch.
3151760	3153760	Coming up next on Fox.
3153760	3158760	Don't miss an all-new episode of Cake Bakers.
3159760	3162760	Look, I made this thing three cheers and it's got frosting.
3162760	3164760	Bleep you! Bleep you!
3164760	3166760	Check it out, Freddy.
3167760	3169760	Wichita. Wichita.
3169760	3174760	Wichita has a glossy coat because of a chuck wagon.
3177760	3179760	You should give it to your dog.
3179760	3181760	I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-ass-head.
3183760	3185760	From Bonanza.
3186760	3189760	And now back to where-teenage werewolf.
3189760	3191760	New Orleans unit.
3192760	3194760	Let me out of this cell!
3195760	3199760	I can-I can-I can-I can sense you with my werewolf powers monitoring me.
3200760	3202760	Son of a bitch.
3202760	3205760	If I could just flash back to Samantha,
3205760	3208760	maybe I would get some kind of wisdom on how to get out of here.
3208760	3210760	I'm always with you, Katie.
3211760	3213760	I quit my job at the coffee place.
3214760	3216760	I work at the jail now.
3216760	3220760	I'm locked in some kind of cell at some kind of umbrella corporation.
3220760	3226760	Listen, I didn't raise you up as a young werewolf lady to give up so easily.
3226760	3229760	I raised a strong-minded woman.
3229760	3231760	You're thirteen now, Katie.
3233760	3234760	Right?
3234760	3235760	Yeah, I think I answered.
3235760	3236760	Okay, yeah.
3236760	3238760	Cause I was dead for a while and we lost track.
3238760	3239760	Alright.
3239760	3245760	I'll just tell ya, this cell isn't as strong as you think it is.
3246760	3247760	Think it is.
3247760	3249760	Think it is.
3249760	3251760	Rhymes with stink-a-miz.
3251760	3252760	Right.
3252760	3255760	The company that makes this bolt on the ceiling.
3255760	3257760	A hatch opens.
3258760	3259760	That was easy.
3259760	3262760	Time to kickbox my way to the end of the episode.
3262760	3265760	Pshah! Pshah! Pshah! Pshah!
3265760	3269760	Damn it, metal shins! Pshah! Pshah!
3269760	3270760	Yeah.
3271760	3276760	I know there'll be more like you in episodes two through twelve.
3277760	3279760	It's in the way that you use it.
3280760	3281760	Back to the school.
3282760	3283760	Uh-oh. Bump.
3283760	3285760	Oh. Hey, watch it.
3285760	3288760	Sorry. I thought you were gone.
3288760	3289760	You know what?
3289760	3292760	I heard you went to jail probably for being a werewolf.
3293760	3297760	Maybe I learned it's worth sticking things out and fighting for what I believe in.
3297760	3298760	Can I ask you a question?
3298760	3299760	Yeah.
3300760	3302760	It's kind of personal though.
3302760	3304760	I'm thirteen. I can take it.
3306760	3310760	I just want to know when the moon comes out, are you hairy everywhere?
3315760	3316760	Dick Wolf.
3316760	3317760	Pretty straight.
3318760	3321760	Alright. Wow. That's a good show, Katie.
3323760	3327760	If I pitch that, you're on board. You're head writer.
3327760	3331760	Is there a reason why werewolf girls have metal shin guards?
3331760	3334760	I don't know. I don't know, man.
3334760	3336760	Is that a vulnerable part of a werewolf?
3336760	3338760	Ask yourself that.
3338760	3341760	Let's bring Spencer up, our dungeon master.
3341760	3348760	We might have to say goodbye to Ben for a moment so Spencer can take his place.
3348760	3350760	Yeah, Ben's been using the Spencer table.
3350760	3354760	Alright, Spencer, our dungeon master. For those of you who don't know, we play D&D on this show,
3354760	3357760	and Spencer has traveled all the way from California to join us.
3357760	3359760	Spencer, everyone.
3362760	3365760	Charlotte. Right?
3365760	3368760	Spencer, what do you think of how the show's been gone?
3368760	3371760	It's been really good. I've been laughing.
3371760	3372760	Really?
3372760	3373760	Can you hear me back there?
3373760	3374760	You don't think it's a little weird?
3374760	3375760	I like weird?
3375760	3377760	Oh, okay. That makes sense.
3377760	3380760	Spencer's toes are fused together, we found out.
3380760	3383760	You can go on Instagram and you can see a picture of his toes.
3383760	3386760	He has a thing. Yes, ma'am?
3386760	3388760	People in our family have that also.
3388760	3389760	Yeah.
3389760	3391760	It's called syndactyly.
3391760	3393760	Yeah. That's what it's called?
3393760	3396760	It's called syndactyly family members from South Carolina.
3396760	3397760	I have two other ones.
3397760	3399760	South Carolina. Yeah, yeah.
3399760	3401760	You guys really hate South Carolina, don't you?
3401760	3403760	They do not want it.
3403760	3406760	They're just like, South Carolina.
3406760	3408760	What is the difference between North and South?
3408760	3409760	Teeth.
3409760	3412760	They're 50th in education or 48th.
3413760	3415760	They're 50th in education.
3415760	3416760	Is that right?
3416760	3418760	He just said, is that true?
3418760	3420760	That's not really true.
3420760	3423760	So out of the 50 states, South Carolina is 50th.
3423760	3424760	They're dead last.
3424760	3425760	They're dead last.
3425760	3427760	And you guys here are 48th.
3427760	3429760	They're 48th.
3429760	3431760	Are you like the governor?
3431760	3433760	You're so invested. What's your name?
3433760	3434760	My name's Henry.
3434760	3435760	Henry?
3437760	3439760	I don't know. I want to uncork this guy.
3439760	3440760	I want to rub this genie's lamp.
3440760	3442760	I want to know more about North Carolina.
3442760	3446760	If I just stick the microphone in your face,
3446760	3449760	will you say interesting things or do I have to be a good interviewer?
3449760	3450760	Okay.
3450760	3456760	There's not a lot to be proud of when you live in North Carolina.
3456760	3462760	You know, but the few things we have is that we're better than South Carolina.
3462760	3463760	Woo!
3463760	3465760	Is there anyone from South Carolina here?
3465760	3467760	Oh, Jesus. Holy shit.
3467760	3470760	Dude, he's surrounded by South Carolinans.
3470760	3471760	Fuck you!
3471760	3473760	Is there a...
3473760	3475760	I'm going to play a property text.
3475760	3476760	Can we do it?
3476760	3477760	Or get a text.
3477760	3478760	Or get a text.
3479760	3481760	I'm going to go out and...
3482760	3483760	Okay.
3483760	3485760	You got this whole table of South Carolina.
3485760	3486760	All right.
3486760	3488760	What do you have to say in South Carolina's defense over here?
3488760	3489760	South Carolina's a shit.
3494760	3496760	It's hard to argue with that.
3496760	3497760	Yeah.
3499760	3502760	You can't be proud that you're 50th in education probably, right?
3502760	3505760	No, but our education system is broken anyway, so...
3506760	3514760	They have Bob Jones University, which is like a conservative Christian university there in South Carolina.
3514760	3521760	Actually, Evangelical Christians talk about making South Carolina a homeland and seceding from the human ones again.
3521760	3523760	It's a messed up place.
3523760	3524760	All right.
3524760	3531760	Jeff, we have a serious human conflict here on the night that I decided we have to figure out a new way to resolve human conflict.
3532760	3535760	I'm going to be the representative for South Carolina, and I'm going to...
3535760	3536760	That's not very brave of you.
3536760	3538760	You're surrounded by...
3539760	3541760	Dan, I've got to tell you, it's the shit.
3544760	3551760	But Abraham Lincoln wanted North Carolina to attack South Carolina, and the Carolinas pulled together and said,
3551760	3552760	look, we're both Carolinas.
3552760	3554760	It seems like a logical thing.
3554760	3559760	Now there's all this division again, just because of a simple direction on a compass.
3560760	3563760	How do you guys feel about Virginia? Do you guys care about that?
3563760	3565760	It's just because you share a name.
3565760	3566760	Henry, how do you feel about Virginia?
3566760	3568760	I think Virginia is slightly better than North Carolina.
3568760	3570760	Oh, really?
3570760	3572760	Wait, better than North?
3572760	3573760	Yeah.
3573760	3575760	Oh, so you're self-loathing Carolina.
3575760	3576760	Okay, well, we can't trust him.
3576760	3583760	It's not that you love North Carolina so much, it's just that it is just a little bit better than South Carolina.
3583760	3584760	It's our little thing.
3584760	3585760	It could be worse.
3585760	3592760	You just want to hop on our tour bus and come smoke weed in California and be liberal and cosmopolitan.
3592760	3594760	I understand that.
3594760	3596760	There's something in the back.
3596760	3598760	Yeah, you probably grow it a lot here, right?
3598760	3599760	There's something in the back.
3599760	3601760	Yeah, of course.
3601760	3604760	I'm going to talk about your exact right about it.
3604760	3607760	It's just the direction of North Carolina and South Carolina.
3607760	3610760	There is a lot that we can do.
3610760	3611760	Okay, okay.
3611760	3613760	Jeff, I'm handing her the mic, okay?
3613760	3620760	Hi, I'm Adrienne, and I'm from North Carolina, and there's a lot to be proud of for North Carolina.
3620760	3622760	We have a ton of awesome things here.
3622760	3624760	Everybody loves North Carolina.
3624760	3626760	South Carolina has awesome things.
3626760	3628760	What are you guys proud of?
3628760	3630760	It's just a, huh?
3630760	3631760	Everything.
3631760	3633760	I mean, we have great people.
3633760	3636760	North Carolina has, no, not just NASCAR.
3636760	3638760	That's everything that people pick on.
3638760	3640760	Don't you guys have, like, peanut butter pie here?
3640760	3641760	Is that a thing here?
3641760	3645760	We're not just, you know, South Carolina people don't just have...
3645760	3649760	I like what you've been saying about getting people together.
3649760	3650760	Hey, how are you?
3650760	3652760	I forgot your name already.
3652760	3653760	I'm Jane.
3653760	3654760	It's nice to meet you.
3654760	3655760	Nice to meet you.
3655760	3656760	What's your name?
3656760	3657760	Adrienne.
3657760	3658760	Adrienne, all right.
3658760	3661760	I came out on a crappy weather night.
3661760	3664760	You thought Rob Schneider was going to be here.
3664760	3666760	No, you're way better.
3667760	3671760	I'm excited to be here, and everything you guys have said has been awesome.
3671760	3674760	But we all are here together, North Carolina, South Carolina.
3674760	3675760	Who cares?
3675760	3677760	I have friends all over the world.
3677760	3679760	And everybody's just here to have fun.
3679760	3680760	It's a comedy.
3680760	3681760	Give it up.
3681760	3682760	Adrienne, everybody.
3682760	3683760	Wow.
3683760	3684760	All right.
3684760	3685760	We're just having a good time.
3685760	3688760	We don't need to talk about the Civil War and whose name we're with.
3688760	3689760	Well, that's my fault.
3689760	3690760	That's my fault.
3690760	3691760	No, but you're an awesome guy.
3691760	3692760	We appreciate you coming.
3692760	3694760	We get awesome comedy.
3694760	3695760	We have museums.
3695760	3696760	We have history.
3696760	3697760	We have the mountains.
3697760	3698760	We have awesome stuff.
3698760	3701760	She's like an awesome Sesame Street character.
3701760	3704760	She's the only one seated behind the wall.
3704760	3707760	She just popped out of a little trash can.
3707760	3709760	Why don't y'all just love each other?
3709760	3711760	I'm like the cute version of the grouch.
3711760	3712760	I'm like this one.
3712760	3713760	I love America.
3713760	3714760	I love everybody.
3714760	3716760	You popped up to help us love each other.
3716760	3717760	That's right.
3717760	3718760	Y'all know me here.
3718760	3719760	Hey, Blair.
3719760	3720760	Hey, Patrick.
3720760	3723760	Wait, if she knows you, why is she taking secret pictures of you?
3723760	3724760	To Instagram.
3724760	3726760	Hey, these are all comedians here.
3726760	3727760	They want to be up there.
3727760	3728760	But I'm not a comedian.
3728760	3731760	I just want to tell everybody to love each other.
3731760	3733760	You know what I think it's time for, Dan?
3733760	3734760	What?
3734760	3736760	I think it's time for you and Adrian to do the happiness rap.
3736760	3737760	Yeah, let's hug it out.
3737760	3738760	All right.
3738760	3739760	You're cute.
3739760	3740760	Come on.
3740760	3741760	Hug it up.
3741760	3743760	Are we going to dance?
3743760	3744760	Yeah.
3744760	3746760	Happiness rap.
3746760	3747760	With Adrian.
3747760	3749760	Rap it in the back of the...
3749760	3750760	Shit.
3750760	3752760	Happiness rap.
3753760	3758760	We're at the Comedy Zone in NC Music Factory.
3758760	3760760	How come you dance so fast?
3760760	3761760	You honest?
3761760	3762760	I'm a little baby.
3762760	3763760	I'm a little toddler.
3763760	3764760	A little toddler.
3764760	3766760	Adrian, rap it in the back.
3766760	3768760	I fucked your mama like she was on crack.
3768760	3770760	I put my dick in her butt.
3770760	3771760	Put it in her mouth.
3771760	3773760	Carolina, north and south.
3773760	3774760	Whoa.
3774760	3775760	No.
3775760	3776760	No, they're the same.
3776760	3777760	No.
3777760	3778760	Carolina, it's all just game.
3778760	3779760	You're just a white house.
3779760	3780760	The government.
3780760	3781760	Oh.
3781760	3782760	Welcome me to the front.
3782760	3783760	Oh, no.
3783760	3784760	I just told you.
3784760	3785760	Whoo.
3785760	3786760	Whoo.
3786760	3790760	The Carolinas, they're all the same.
3790760	3792760	It's just a big government game.
3792760	3794760	Trying to make you feel different.
3794760	3795760	Put you against each other.
3795760	3797760	People fighting brother, brother.
3797760	3798760	Brother, brother.
3798760	3799760	Civil war.
3799760	3800760	Bullshit.
3800760	3801760	Bullshit.
3801760	3803760	Fuck your mama.
3803760	3804760	No.
3804760	3805760	Love it up.
3805760	3806760	Now it's Carolina.
3806760	3807760	South Carolina.
3807760	3808760	Whoo.
3808760	3810760	Everybody, love it out.
3810760	3811760	Love it out.
3811760	3812760	What's up?
3812760	3813760	Love it out.
3813760	3814760	Who cares?
3814760	3815760	Love it out.
3815760	3816760	Love it out.
3816760	3817760	I don't know.
3817760	3818760	Do it.
3818760	3819760	No shit.
3819760	3820760	It's all right.
3820760	3821760	It's all right.
3821760	3822760	It's all right.
3822760	3823760	Love it out.
3823760	3824760	Love it out.
3824760	3825760	Thank you.
3825760	3826760	Thank you, Adrienne.
3826760	3827760	All right.
3827760	3828760	Adrienne, everybody.
3828760	3831760	This mic's a lot less hot than this mic.
3831760	3832760	Thank you.
3832760	3833760	One rock.
3833760	3834760	Thank you for coming here to start.
3834760	3835760	Do you work here, Adrienne?
3835760	3836760	No.
3836760	3837760	I just came out.
3837760	3838760	Because it's cold.
3838760	3839760	It's a lap.
3839760	3840760	Oh, well, thank you.
3840760	3841760	Yeah.
3841760	3843760	You know, Dan, actually, it's weird.
3843760	3847760	Adrienne actually died 15 years ago.
3847760	3850760	That's her ghost?
3850760	3852760	Yeah.
3852760	3854760	She had snakes for hair.
3854760	3856760	That's a ghost story.
3856760	3860760	The Comedy Zone is haunted by the most positive ghost in the world.
3860760	3863760	It makes sense, because Hitler died here.
3863760	3867760	So, of course, it would be haunted by a very happy lady.
3868760	3871760	Oh, and you're a Jew.
3871760	3873760	So, Hitler's bunker is haunted by a Jewish ghost.
3873760	3874760	By a happy Jew.
3874760	3875760	Happy Jew.
3875760	3878760	Hey, it could be worse.
3878760	3880760	That's Hitler's purgatory.
3880760	3882760	He has to walk around his death bunker.
3882760	3884760	And Adrienne is just like, hey, hug it out.
3884760	3885760	Hug it out, Hitler.
3885760	3886760	Hitler, have a sandwich.
3886760	3887760	Come on, Hitler.
3887760	3889760	Would you eat something?
3889760	3890760	I forgive you, Hitler.
3890760	3891760	It's OK.
3891760	3894760	Let the bygones be the bygones.
3894760	3897760	And Hitler's like, this is a way to live your life.
3897760	3901760	This is a place to die.
3901760	3905760	We went to the Anne Frank Museum in, what do you call it, Amsterdam.
3905760	3907760	That was some heavy shit with me and Aaron.
3907760	3908760	I don't know.
3908760	3911760	I'm done with that conversation.
3911760	3912760	But it was weird.
3912760	3915760	You can't help when you're somewhere that serious.
3915760	3916760	Is the house still there?
3916760	3918760	Do you get to go up into the attic and stuff?
3918760	3920760	Yeah, but everything is reinforced with stainless steel
3920760	3924760	to keep everyone from farting on something important.
3924760	3930760	And her dad demanded out of deference to,
3930760	3934760	because once the Frank family got turned in,
3934760	3937760	the Nazis came through and they cleared all the shit out.
3937760	3941760	And her dad said, don't ever furnish it as a museum.
3941760	3944760	All the rooms should be empty as a symbolic thing.
3944760	3947760	So you're really just, I mean, good for him.
3947760	3952760	I'm certainly not going to tell him how to run an Anne Frank museum.
3952760	3955760	But the customer's always right.
3955760	3957760	It's a little boring.
3957760	3960760	Could use a couple sofas.
3960760	3966760	You really are just walking through and reading stuff on the wall that you could probably Google.
3966760	3970760	You could Google a lot of it.
3970760	3975760	They should call it the pre-Google Memorial Museum.
3976760	3980760	I think they literally went on Google, printed the stuff up,
3980760	3982760	put it in a plexiglass frame, hung it on the wall.
3982760	3986760	You walk through, look at the stuff that they Googled.
3986760	3989760	Fuck you, Anne Frank Museum.
3989760	3991760	Sorry.
3991760	3993760	It's such a bold stance, man.
3993760	3995760	Someone's got to take it.
3995760	3997760	It sounds like you really suffered.
3997760	4000760	Speaking of suffering, I think it's time to play a little D&D.
4000760	4002760	How do you guys feel about that?
4002760	4004760	That's not what I was going for.
4004760	4006760	We're going to need Aaron up here, though.
4006760	4008760	Aaron McGathey to the stage, please.
4008760	4010760	Aaron McGathey.
4013760	4015760	I wish we had a mic.
4015760	4019760	I have an idea, because we have a mic pointed at the audience,
4019760	4021760	and it's right in front of your face.
4021760	4022760	What's your name, sir?
4022760	4023760	Drew.
4023760	4025760	Drew.
4025760	4029760	Would you take this mic, and we never do this for D&D.
4029760	4032760	Do the sound effects for anything.
4033760	4036760	If they say a horse gallops up, you might do...
4036760	4039760	You can come up and share my mic, Drew.
4039760	4043760	If you're in Amsterdam, still check out the Anne Frank Museum.
4044760	4046760	It's pretty moving.
4046760	4051760	The explanation for the furniture not being there was that so many people were lost,
4051760	4053760	so there can't be anything in the building.
4053760	4055760	It was a little silly.
4055760	4058760	There must have been something else that was going on there.
4058760	4060760	You don't have to high-road me.
4060760	4062760	No, no, I'm not.
4062760	4064760	I'd be outstanding at it.
4064760	4067760	I would hate for anyone here to be in Amsterdam and be like,
4067760	4070760	well, Dan Herman said to not go to the museum.
4070760	4071760	Go, still go.
4071760	4072760	Is there a gift shop there?
4072760	4074760	There is, yeah.
4074760	4076760	What's for sale, not a t-shirt?
4076760	4078760	Her hair, all of her hair.
4081760	4084760	Different copies of the book.
4084760	4086760	I bought a bunch of postcards.
4086760	4087760	I was really moved.
4087760	4089760	I was the only one at our party that was super into it.
4089760	4092760	Beautiful little shampoo bottles shaped like Anne Frank.
4092760	4096760	There are flashlights and blankets for hiding.
4096760	4097760	What?
4097760	4099760	I don't see it when you connect the dots.
4099760	4101760	That's when they boo.
4101760	4104760	All right, Spencer, get us up to date.
4104760	4105760	All right.
4105760	4106760	I'm sorry.
4109760	4113760	When we last met, our group had just split up.
4113760	4116760	Moolrain fleeing the scene to meditate at the sacred grove.
4116760	4120760	Quark thrown onto the back of a deadly candroid.
4120760	4124760	And Sharpie left to clean up the dead after the great battle of Butzallot camp.
4124760	4127760	Quark infiltrated the great black ship of Darkstar's fleet,
4127760	4132760	checking out various rooms, while Sharpie had connected the moment he'd always desired with his father.
4132760	4137760	Reaching a new understanding, his father bestowed upon Sharpie the greatest gift of all,
4137760	4140760	his magic cloak, the symbol of leadership of meltzallot tribe.
4140760	4141760	I'm sorry, can you pause there?
4141760	4145760	I keep thinking about Adrienne in the back, not knowing what the fuck's going on.
4145760	4146760	Why?
4146760	4149760	Now I can't stop thinking about her point of view.
4149760	4151760	She just came in.
4151760	4154760	We're playing Dungeons and Dragons in front of her.
4154760	4157760	I'm almost certain that she's going to be good with it, then.
4157760	4160760	Adrienne, are you on board?
4160760	4161760	A little bit.
4161760	4164760	I want to tell them what I'm thinking about, too.
4164760	4167760	I was told by the staff that she's the Adam Goldberg of this place,
4167760	4171760	that she becomes every chef.
4171760	4175760	Adrienne, we're playing a make-believe game where you've...
4175760	4179760	I'm not worried about what you said about fucking my mama for the business.
4179760	4182760	It's the easiest and now I'm going to be embarrassed.
4182760	4184760	Oh, no, we'll edit out where I fuck your mama.
4184760	4186760	He's not really going to fuck your mama.
4186760	4189760	No, she's worried her mama will hear it in the show.
4189760	4190760	I'll fuck you.
4190760	4191760	Then I'll fuck her.
4191760	4195760	No, we'll all fuck her.
4196760	4199760	Okay, now we're going to fuck your mama, because now it's for real.
4199760	4202760	Then we got all, like, Jewishy and then she got Jewishy.
4202760	4205760	I don't discriminate on mamas.
4205760	4207760	All right.
4209760	4211760	Okay, Adrienne.
4211760	4213760	Pipe it.
4213760	4217760	No, I was concerned about her, like, not having an eye into it.
4219760	4220760	All right, sorry, Spencer continues.
4220760	4222760	Just making sure.
4222760	4226760	While deep in meditation, Mulrain was disturbed by the sounds of a troubled horse.
4226760	4230760	Inspecting further, he discovered a dead woman while wearing a belt of gender-switching,
4230760	4232760	as well as a tied-up horse.
4232760	4236760	Mulrain put it on and regained her original feminine form.
4236760	4239760	Swiftly, she rode, rejoining Sharpie at Yellow Camp,
4239760	4242760	and together with the magic of his father's cape, the two teleported,
4242760	4245760	rejoining Quark and the hold of the black ship,
4245760	4248760	just in time to hear the loud claxons of a warning alarm going off.
4248760	4251760	Shit was about to go down.
4251760	4253760	Go.
4253760	4255760	Yeah, I was in a blackout drunk.
4255760	4257760	Like, when you...
4257760	4260760	You put your magic cloak on and you joined me on the ship.
4260760	4263760	I'd been kicking some ass and killing some dudes with some cannons.
4263760	4266760	And some yellow creatures and some black creatures.
4266760	4268760	You're right.
4268760	4272760	And I intimidated a black creature, and it was pretty cool.
4272760	4277760	And then you guys teleported up to join me on the mothership,
4277760	4279760	presumably of Admiral Darkstar.
4279760	4280760	Both of us?
4280760	4281760	Yeah, you're both together.
4281760	4282760	You were that fucked up?
4282760	4284760	I was that fucked up, too.
4284760	4286760	You know I'm a woman now.
4286760	4287760	I mean, you guys have no idea.
4287760	4290760	This show is ten times better than Nashville.
4290760	4293760	They were having a better time, it sounded like,
4293760	4295760	because they were fucked up, too.
4295760	4298760	You hear, like, oh, we're laughing, we're having a good time,
4298760	4300760	but I'm telling you, I sound like a maniac.
4300760	4303760	That's why I came in here low-key and was like, you know,
4303760	4307760	I wanted to mellow it out a little bit.
4307760	4309760	Well, you've certainly done that.
4309760	4311760	But then we ended up kickboxing with werewolves.
4311760	4312760	It's kind of fun.
4312760	4313760	Yeah, that's true.
4313760	4314760	All right.
4314760	4316760	So I examine the surrounding, Spencer.
4316760	4317760	You're in a long room.
4317760	4319760	Behind you stands a row of cannons.
4319760	4321760	Their position is fixed, but the housing they're mounted on
4321760	4325760	looks like it can be swung around 360 degrees.
4325760	4327760	The alarm blares, and you know it's only a matter of time
4327760	4329760	before someone comes to check it out.
4329760	4332760	The remaining yellow demon is sliding across the floor
4332760	4336760	towards a large yellow grate in the far wall.
4336760	4337760	Total what?
4338760	4340760	A grate in the far wall.
4340760	4342760	The door in front of you remains closed.
4342760	4344760	Could I take the cannon and swivel it around
4344760	4345760	and shoot the door?
4345760	4346760	Totally.
4346760	4347760	Totally.
4347760	4348760	All right.
4348760	4349760	I swivel the cannon.
4349760	4350760	Stand back, everybody.
4350760	4352760	I'm going to blow the door open.
4354760	4355760	That's true, everybody.
4355760	4357760	This is great.
4357760	4360760	The door blasts open with a loud explosion.
4363760	4365760	You see the main room.
4365760	4367760	This room is covered in pipes, tubes, metal gauges,
4367760	4369760	and all manner of valves and knobs.
4369760	4371760	Aside from the door you just came through,
4371760	4373760	you see doors on your left and on your right,
4373760	4376760	and a large open hatch on the floor before you.
4376760	4378760	If you remember, Quark, that's how you got into this room.
4378760	4380760	All right, so I'm back where I came in.
4380760	4381760	Yeah.
4381760	4382760	Got it.
4382760	4385760	There's two doors that I did not go through the first time.
4385760	4387760	The door to your right has a large sign
4387760	4389760	in a language you can't read.
4389760	4391760	Does anybody here have a power to read languages?
4391760	4393760	Can you tell us more about that language?
4393760	4394760	What does it look like?
4394760	4398760	I'll tell you it's abyssal, and you recognize it as abyssal.
4398760	4400760	You speak abyssal.
4400760	4401760	I do?
4401760	4402760	Yeah.
4402760	4403760	Well, what does it say?
4403760	4405760	What does it say?
4405760	4407760	Bridge.
4407760	4409760	Ooh.
4409760	4410760	It says bridge.
4410760	4412760	It's written in abyssal.
4413760	4416760	I say we go to the bridge and take this mother down.
4416760	4417760	Yeah.
4417760	4418760	Let's do it.
4418760	4420760	The door seems to be locked.
4421760	4424760	Sorry, I just did a quick walkie-talkie check.
4426760	4428760	Switch to channel three, you guys.
4430760	4434760	The corridor that we're in is lined with doors on either side.
4434760	4437760	There's another door besides the one I mentioned,
4437760	4440760	and there's a hatch in the floor that would go down a floor.
4440760	4441760	Right.
4441760	4444760	I try to open the other door.
4444760	4446760	The metal door opens with a whoosh,
4446760	4449760	and you can see a large pool of yellowy, liquid,
4449760	4451760	flesh swirling around.
4453760	4454760	What is this?
4454760	4458760	Occasionally, you see a face contorted in agony drift up to the surface
4458760	4460760	before giving a heart-shrieking wail
4460760	4462760	and sinking down to the bottom of the fluid.
4464760	4466760	This looks like a party we don't want to join, gentlemen.
4466760	4468760	You see several buttons on the far wall.
4468760	4471760	There's a grate on the floor on the left side of the room
4471760	4472760	and a small door to your right.
4472760	4474760	So there's a big puddle of yellow flesh goo
4474760	4476760	and a face occasionally is bubbling around in it?
4476760	4477760	Yep.
4477760	4479760	And there are buttons, and there's a grate.
4479760	4481760	You see a coalescing figure.
4481760	4482760	It's one of those yellow demons.
4482760	4486760	It rises out of the mush and slides past it across the door.
4490760	4493760	It doesn't seem to be giving you any notice.
4494760	4496760	A creature!
4497760	4499760	Name yourself!
4500760	4502760	It doesn't seem to give you any notice.
4502760	4504760	What is it doing?
4504760	4506760	It just slid out of the room.
4506760	4507760	Oh, you just left?
4507760	4508760	Yep.
4509760	4510760	That was easy.
4513760	4514760	Did the buttons say anything?
4514760	4515760	What the buttons do?
4515760	4516760	The buttons aren't labeled.
4516760	4517760	There's five of them.
4518760	4519760	Are they different colors?
4519760	4520760	They are not.
4520760	4522760	What color are they?
4522760	4524760	The grate.
4527760	4530760	And then there's a door to your right.
4530760	4532760	Can I cast knock on it?
4532760	4535760	Isn't that like a spell that opens up
4535760	4536760	and lock doors?
4536760	4539760	Yeah, knock is a spell that'll unlock any
4539760	4541760	locker, you know.
4541760	4542760	Yeah, I see.
4542760	4543760	You guys were laughing at me.
4543760	4544760	If it's non-magical.
4545760	4546760	You cast it, right?
4546760	4548760	Yeah, I cast knock like the Dickens.
4548760	4550760	The door blasts open.
4550760	4552760	This hall is empty, save the human.
4553760	4556760	The human standing in front of a door down the hall.
4557760	4559760	At the sound of the knock spell,
4559760	4560760	he takes notice of you.
4560760	4563760	The man is almost naked, wearing only an orange wrap
4563760	4566760	around his waist and holding a wicked-looking metal whip.
4567760	4569760	He seems to be guarding something.
4570760	4572760	He cracks his whip with menace.
4574760	4576760	Drew is killing it.
4578760	4580760	So this guy looks like a bad guy probably, right?
4580760	4581760	Combat's happening.
4581760	4582760	Combat is happening.
4583760	4585760	Whose turn is it?
4585760	4587760	The first person to react, I suppose.
4587760	4590760	I react with the power attack.
4590760	4593760	Charging through the door, you leap towards the foe,
4593760	4594760	with a power attack.
4595760	4596760	One, two, or three?
4596760	4597760	Two.
4597760	4598760	Two.
4600760	4601760	You hit!
4603760	4606760	Striking the arm, holding the whip.
4607760	4610760	Your sword cuts into his arm wickedly.
4614760	4616760	The man is almost felled.
4616760	4619760	He responds by snapping his whip at you.
4621760	4623760	It's a critical hit.
4623760	4624760	Uh-oh.
4625760	4626760	Thanks, Drew.
4630760	4633760	You take 18 damage and fall to your feet.
4633760	4634760	Fucking hell.
4634760	4638760	So I'm down to 40 hit points, so I'm down to 22?
4638760	4639760	Correct.
4639760	4640760	Shitballs.
4641760	4643760	The man seems wounded.
4643760	4645760	Do I still have my amulet of heel thingy?
4645760	4648760	It's around your neck, yes, but it takes a while to boot up.
4648760	4651760	I hit control alternate delete.
4652760	4654760	And reboot it.
4654760	4655760	It starts booting.
4657760	4658760	Sharpier moorane.
4658760	4661760	I cast charm person on this googa.
4661760	4663760	You cast charm person.
4663760	4664760	He's entitled to a will save.
4665760	4667760	Oh shit, he's kicking ass.
4667760	4669760	He, the charm, unaffects him.
4669760	4671760	It fails to effect him.
4671760	4682760	I boldly and bravely shoot two arrows at the creature.
4682760	4685760	One of the arrows strikes him right in the neck.
4688760	4689760	It does 10 damage.
4689760	4691760	He falls to the floor bleeding out.
4692760	4693760	He's dead.
4693760	4694760	He's dead?
4694760	4695760	He's dead.
4695760	4696760	We got him.
4697760	4701760	Search him, search his ass.
4702760	4705760	He's wearing an orange wrap and holding a wicked whip.
4705760	4706760	It might be magical.
4707760	4712760	I hand the whip to Quark and I take off his orange wrap.
4712760	4714760	If only just to see his privates.
4714760	4715760	You feel better about yourself.
4720760	4722760	I point at them and laugh.
4723760	4724760	It's hilarious.
4727760	4729760	There's a door behind him.
4729760	4730760	There's a door behind him.
4730760	4736760	I wrap the orange wrap around me and go, I'm a guy with a whip.
4736760	4738760	I'm dying.
4738760	4739760	You're a human.
4739760	4740760	He was a human.
4740760	4744760	You should maybe put on the orange wrap, take your shirt off and take the whip.
4744760	4746760	You can go and you pretend you're that guy.
4746760	4748760	What's this guy look like?
4748760	4750760	He just looks like a scrawny pale human.
4750760	4752760	So do I, right?
4752760	4754760	What's your strength?
4755760	4757760	What's your constitution?
4757760	4759760	You're pretty scrawny.
4759760	4761760	My strength is 9, my constitution is 16.
4761760	4764760	I'd say you're a well-built chap.
4764760	4765760	Right.
4765760	4767760	So I don't look like this guy with my clothes on?
4767760	4771760	I mean, you look more like him than an elf or a gnome.
4771760	4772760	I say it's worth a try, Sharpie.
4772760	4774760	I'm going to assume, yeah, just what the hell, you know?
4774760	4775760	Yeah.
4775760	4776760	I mean, it can't hurt.
4776760	4780760	I fold up my magic robes, put it inside his orange wrap, wrap the orange wrap around me,
4780760	4783760	and then walk around with his dumb ass whip.
4783760	4785760	You make a passable disguise.
4785760	4786760	What's that?
4786760	4787760	You make a passable disguise.
4787760	4790760	You're not sure, but you're pretty sure it'll work.
4790760	4791760	All right.
4791760	4793760	My attraction lessons.
4797760	4799760	Standing at the door.
4800760	4804760	After you, Sharpie, I open the door.
4804760	4806760	This room is full of metal lockers.
4806760	4807760	They appear to be locked.
4807760	4811760	You also see a large key ring on a small wooden table littered with maps.
4811760	4812760	Snatch.
4814760	4816760	He saved every one of us.
4818760	4819760	I take the key ring.
4819760	4820760	What was the first thing you said?
4820760	4821760	This room is filled with what?
4821760	4822760	Lockers.
4822760	4823760	Metal lockers.
4823760	4824760	And maps on a table.
4824760	4825760	Let's get that key ring.
4825760	4827760	Hey, check out these maps.
4827760	4831760	The maps depict the Butts Expanse and the Axbeard Mountains,
4831760	4835760	as well as a large landmass you're not familiar with.
4836760	4841760	Where's the landmass in relation to the butts, butts, butts, butts a lot?
4841760	4842760	It's in the water.
4842760	4846760	You can't see any other landmarks that you'd recognize on the map.
4847760	4851760	I pick up the keys and try to open them.
4851760	4852760	Nice.
4852760	4858760	I jingle them around just because I lock my Prius
4858760	4863760	and I go to try to open the lockers with the keys.
4863760	4864760	You unlock all the lockers.
4864760	4865760	Here's what you get.
4865760	4867760	A loot of charming.
4867760	4868760	I'll take it.
4868760	4869760	A power bracelet.
4869760	4871760	Eight good arrows.
4871760	4872760	Eight sleep arrows.
4872760	4874760	Twenty V arrows.
4874760	4876760	A chime of opening.
4876760	4877760	Four beads of force.
4877760	4881760	And a pi-dridge and a patty.
4882760	4884760	May I have the arrows, gentlemen?
4884760	4885760	Of course.
4885760	4886760	Yeah, go ahead.
4886760	4887760	Thank you.
4887760	4888760	Thank you.
4888760	4889760	Let me just pick these up slowly.
4891760	4892760	Arrow sound.
4895760	4898760	What was that charm of opening?
4898760	4899760	What was that?
4899760	4900760	The chime of opening.
4900760	4901760	Chime of opening?
4901760	4903760	It's a small metal tube.
4904760	4905760	Right.
4906760	4908760	Is this like a dick joke?
4909760	4910760	No.
4910760	4911760	I should have went there.
4911760	4913760	It's just a small metal tube that opens things?
4913760	4914760	Okay.
4914760	4916760	There's a little tag tied to it.
4916760	4917760	A little tag?
4917760	4918760	To use.
4918760	4919760	Ring this chime.
4919760	4920760	Oh.
4921760	4922760	Okay.
4923760	4924760	It's a chime of opening.
4924760	4925760	Okay.
4925760	4926760	All right.
4926760	4928760	It probably works like my knock spell, right?
4928760	4929760	I don't know.
4929760	4930760	All right.
4930760	4936760	So we gather up all that booty and we probably take these maps.
4936760	4938760	Are there other doorways in this room?
4938760	4942760	You see a hatch in the ceiling and there's no ladder leading up to it.
4942760	4946760	However, a silver staff lies in the corner of the room.
4946760	4950760	I approach the staff and grab the staff.
4950760	4953760	Grabbing the staff, you hold the staff.
4954760	4965760	Holding the staff, I use it to pivot my beautiful woman body up to the hatch.
4965760	4971760	As you strike the bottom of the rod against the floor, it begins to grow in length.
4971760	4974760	Soon, the rod is at the top of the hatch.
4974760	4976760	Now, this is a dick joke, right?
4976760	4978760	Yeah, it is.
4978760	4979760	I have the weirdest boner.
4979760	4982760	I stroke the staff to thank it.
4984760	4986760	It pulses.
4990760	4992760	So can we climb that staff now to get up to the hatch?
4992760	4995760	You get the sense it would be easy to climb such a staff.
4995760	4996760	All right.
4996760	4997760	I climb the staff.
4997760	4998760	We all climb the staff.
4998760	4999760	You all.
4999760	5000760	Yes, Adrian.
5000760	5001760	I have a question.
5001760	5002760	Oh, shit.
5002760	5003760	It's all right.
5003760	5004760	Adrian's got a question.
5004760	5005760	Okay.
5005760	5006760	We can't judge people in Hermitown for...
5006760	5007760	Everybody's coming in.
5010760	5011760	I have a question.
5011760	5012760	I just got sleepy.
5012760	5013760	It's kind of hot in here.
5013760	5014760	Yeah.
5014760	5015760	Want to talk about something else?
5019760	5024760	Adrian just gave a justifiable critique of how the evening's going.
5024760	5025760	Adrian.
5025760	5026760	It's a little hot in here.
5026760	5027760	She's getting a little sleepy.
5027760	5028760	What do you do?
5028760	5029760	What do you do, Adrian?
5029760	5030760	Let's not talk about me.
5030760	5031760	That's not fair.
5031760	5032760	Let's not talk about you.
5032760	5033760	Wait a minute.
5033760	5034760	That's not fair.
5034760	5037760	If you're bored with us, I want to see you present something.
5038760	5039760	You'll know I got really sleepy.
5039760	5041760	I fall asleep over here, wake me up.
5041760	5042760	We will.
5042760	5043760	You just stretch out, Adrian.
5043760	5044760	Do your thing.
5044760	5045760	Yeah, yeah.
5045760	5046760	Yeah.
5046760	5047760	Yeah, kick back.
5047760	5050760	I don't want to be a bitch, but I don't care how Adrian feels.
5050760	5053760	I care how everyone else feels.
5058760	5059760	Jesus Christ.
5060760	5062760	Well, I mean, but it is rude.
5062760	5063760	It's okay.
5063760	5064760	I'm sure you're a sweetheart.
5064760	5066760	Maybe you're a little drunk, but it is a little rude.
5066760	5067760	It's okay.
5067760	5068760	You're pretty.
5068760	5070760	Just fucking bury your prettiness and other things.
5071760	5073760	This is going wild.
5073760	5074760	Hitler died in this room.
5074760	5075760	It's fine.
5075760	5078760	I mean, I come up here and I flounder and foil.
5078760	5079760	I don't care about you disrespecting me.
5079760	5081760	I care about you disrespecting everybody else.
5082760	5083760	Okay.
5083760	5085760	Well, then just stop fucking talking.
5085760	5086760	Fine.
5086760	5088760	You're going to be fine.
5088760	5089760	She's fine.
5089760	5090760	She's going to be fine.
5090760	5091760	You're going to be fine.
5091760	5092760	I adore you.
5092760	5093760	You're going to be fine.
5093760	5094760	Just stop talking.
5094760	5095760	Do I have to make the sound effects?
5096760	5097760	Drew wants to know if they fight.
5097760	5098760	Should he make the sound effect?
5098760	5101760	Adrian, we're climbing a magical staff into a different room,
5103760	5106760	which sounds very boring, but it's happening.
5107760	5108760	I'm still happy I'm here.
5111760	5115760	The American citizen guy with a completely foreign accent
5116760	5118760	just expressed his total happiness with being here.
5118760	5119760	What was your name again, sir?
5119760	5120760	Clayton.
5120760	5121760	Clayton?
5121760	5122760	It's even a foreign name.
5123760	5125760	So British or Australian.
5125760	5126760	Apparently too.
5126760	5127760	Is it something?
5127760	5128760	Apparently.
5128760	5129760	Where is Newcastle?
5129760	5130760	I still don't know.

5140760	5141760	All right.
5141760	5142760	We took a little break.
5142760	5143760	Let's wrap this adventure up.
5143760	5144760	Okay.
5144760	5145760	So we'll leave that as a cliffhanger.

5175760	5177760	It's a Carolina conflict in here.
5177760	5181760	It's like, you know, when we grow up close to each other,
5181760	5183760	we rub elbows.
5183760	5185760	The people that are closest to each other, Jeff,
5185760	5187760	they can really hurt each other the most.
5187760	5188760	Yeah.
5188760	5190760	That's what we learned in North Carolina tonight.
5190760	5195760	I forced it, but it's a lesson.
5195760	5198760	Now I think it's time for the,
5198760	5202760	it's time to find the best singers in the audience.

5274760	5275760	Got a lot of drunken ladies expressing rage.
5275760	5278760	Got people turning against each other for no reason.
5278760	5281760	I fucked your mama every year and every season.
5281760	5284760	I put some salt on her pussy, pepper on her nuts.
5284760	5287760	I fucked your mama in seven of her butts.
5287760	5290760	She's got seven butts because she's a mythical creature.
5290760	5293760	I fucked your mama like the Hobbit feature.
5293760	5295760	It's three movies.
5295760	5296760	Why it was one book.

5332760	5335760	A motherfucker gonna go in the rain.
5335760	5338760	I got pylons and storm drains.
5338760	5341760	Got your mama in the fucking lane.
5341760	5344760	I tried to pass her but her ass was too big.
5344760	5347760	I fucked your mama, she's a newton, a fig.
5347760	5350760	A fig newton is what I meant.

5370760	5372760	Do you have a right to cough?
5372760	5375760	If someone sneezes, do you say gazoon tight?
5375760	5378760	She says some shit but Aaron wasn't alright.
5378760	5381760	She said shut the fuck up, she said I can talk.
5381760	5384760	If I can do this then anyone can speak and walk.
5384760	5387760	I walk around the room, your mama's got a womb.
5387760	5390760	I'm back inside it and it's gonna be my tomb, Hitler.

5407760	5410760	I took my shoes off and hit her in the face.
5410760	5413760	I fucked your mama regardless of her race.
5413760	5416760	I went to the moon and colonized it.
5416760	5419760	I took your mama outside and squeezed both of her tits.
5419760	5422760	I had some milk come out, put it all in my coffee.
5422760	5427760	I said hey bitch, you turned me off, you see.
5427760	5431760	And then I started to say other shit but didn't really matter
5431760	5435760	because it had been a long night.
5435760	5438760	I fucked your mama alright.
5438760	5440760	Come on down to Harbin Town.
5440760	5441760	Everybody.

5467760	5470760	I just wanna stroke it, be gentle and kind.
5470760	5473760	I want all of my brothers to hit, pause and rewind
5473760	5476760	and go back to a time when we can love each other.
5476760	5479760	Don't want Carolina brothers to fight.
5479760	5482760	The other mountains are the same out our window.
5482760	5484760	I fucked your mama.
5484760	5485760	It's okay.

5524760	5527760	Fucked your mama like her name was Rover.
5527760	5530760	Turned her to sit down and roll.
5530760	5533760	Fucked your mama in a Gallup poll.
5533760	5535760	I said, what do you think?
5535760	5537760	She said, I'm a Democrat.
5537760	5539760	I put her ass in the kitchen sink.
5539760	5542760	Tripped my dick and put it in a cup.
5542760	5545760	But fucked your mama so hard she got all fucked up.
