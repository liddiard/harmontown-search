0	3080	Hear ye, hear ye, Harmonians.
3080	9420	This is Dan Harmon talking to you from the studio, as opposed to live on stage, simply
9420	15860	because we lost the first three minutes of our recording due to a little technical crash.
15860	18000	It happens.
18000	22320	You only miss the very beginning of the live recording.
22320	27520	So I'm just introducing it to make it make sense.
27520	30120	While I've got your ear, I will caution you.
30120	36120	This is an unexpectedly intimate episode of Harmontown.
36120	44800	They're not usually family fair, but I will say, if you had any respect for me or my friend
44800	56760	Rob Schwab, and it was based in any way on our manners or our concern for our own posteriors
56760	64200	and lack of experimentation with them, maybe don't listen to this episode.
64200	71240	Maybe just watch Community and the other shows and comic books and things that we make and
71240	73220	think of us as decent people.
73220	82480	But if you do listen on, you're going to hear a story from me about my butthole and a story
82480	84360	from Rob about his.
84360	87240	We didn't plan for that to be the theme of the evening, but it really turned out to
87240	90200	be the case.
90200	91200	That's about it.
91200	96160	Oh, I also just want to plug Harmon and Schwab's Found Crap, which is going to be part of the
96160	102520	Everything is Terrible Festival on August 26th, I think at 5.30 p.m.
102520	106760	Come see, Rob Schwab puts together all these amazing found footage things.
106760	111320	If you're in Los Angeles or near Los Angeles, it's definitely worth coming out for.
111320	114800	Both he and I will be there and love to see you there.
114800	116920	We now join Harmontown in progress.
116920	122000	Just to give you the context, Jeff started the show with some sexy music.
122000	123720	We were talking about sexy music.
123720	127960	It reminded me of the fact that I had given my girlfriend a little fashion show recently
127960	134040	to Sade Music, or I'm sorry, one more time.
134040	136040	We now join Harmontown in progress.
136040	139320	Just to give you the context, what you miss at the beginning is that Jeff started the
139320	143600	show with some sexy music, which reminded me of the fact that I had given my girlfriend
143600	150080	a little fashion show a couple of days earlier because she had bought me some new clothes.
150080	151080	Here we go.
151080	155680	And she said, what music makes you feel sexy?
155680	159000	And I immediately inexplicably blurted out Sade.
159000	167680	We were just playing a Sade album and I was trying on a bunch of checkered nerd shirts.
168680	169880	Was it Smooth Operator?
169880	174360	Yeah, well, Smooth Operator was in there, Sweetest Taboo, of course.
174360	179320	I remember it brought to mind a memory that I thought was so odd.
179320	186440	When I was in junior high, in Milwaukee in the 80s, they had this thing.
186440	189120	They were called desegregation traps.
189120	193640	They had come up with this thing where we had so many inner-city schools that were so
193640	195240	predominantly African-American.
196040	197520	By the way, I hate that phrase.
197520	199720	Isn't that a little demeaning, African-American?
199720	203480	They're not Afri- that makes it sound like they're foreigners.
203480	207480	No one has a- no one is more American than a black person.
207480	210160	Who has more right to not be hyphenated like that?
210160	211800	That's terrible.
211800	217240	Anyways, but it's up to them.
217240	228480	I actually thought- I always thought- we're going to do Race again.
228480	232640	I thought we settled this in like three Harmon towns.
232640	235840	I didn't even get a chance to talk about it last time.
235840	239160	Dick's got all opity about it.
239160	244920	He wanted to hear about Mars Rovers and, you know, Shrob was heckling and we might bring
244920	245920	Shrob up later.
245920	250200	I don't want him to tell his butthole doctor story, but I'm way off track already.
250200	253080	This is not a- this is going to be a low-key Harmon town.
253080	255520	I'm very, very hungover.
255520	256720	What was I just talking about?
256720	257720	Okay, Race.
257720	258720	Desegregation.
258720	264560	It doesn't- it doesn't really- this story has nothing to do with Race, really.
264560	270400	I bet it does.
270400	281440	In eighth grade, seventh and eighth grade, I went to Steuben Middle School and it was
281440	284520	for the computer specialty, which was a desegregation trap.
284520	289480	In reality, they had six Apple IIEs in the basement and they just wanted to- they were
289480	296440	trying to bus white kids into schools that were so disproportionately black.
296440	301280	And so I was like one of six white kids there to use their Apple IIEs in this school.
301280	302280	It was great.
302280	309120	By the way, white people, much more racist than black people.
309120	313600	That's a genetic trait that I can actually- I believe in because I went to- for much of
313600	319400	my public school life, I went to predominantly black schools and I never got picked on or-
319400	325220	it was only when I went to the suburbs and started, you know, in these more predominantly
325220	328820	white schools, I started getting picked on like a- I remember a girl took a piece of
328820	335220	tape and taped it secretly to a pair of jeans to- as a way of tracking how often I wore
335220	340220	them in a week.
340220	341540	Like I was some kind of animal.
341540	346140	I was like, this did- black people don't do this.
346140	349220	That's a stereotype I am comfortable saying.
349220	351820	Black people are nicer than this.
351820	357540	I'm not a big fan of racial constructs, but I believe black people are nicer and less
357540	359260	racist than white people there.
359260	360260	Okay.
360260	362420	I did get a little- so I was going-
362420	365700	This story is not about race, everybody.
365700	368980	Would you guys take it easy?
368980	371780	The story will not lean towards race.
371780	374060	And we're- you notice that we chased N.T. off.
374060	375060	Where's N.T.?
375060	377140	He was always in the front row.
377140	379140	Empty seat.
380140	381140	Dumb.
381140	383140	Edit it out.
383140	384140	Just stupid.
384140	385140	Leave it.
385140	386140	Leave it.
386140	388140	It stays.
388140	390140	I'm not witty tonight.
390140	399140	I'm not- I can tell- I'm a verbal thinker and I can feel the muscle in my verbal lobe.
399140	404140	You know, I can tell you- there's days when it's on fire, you know, and it's kind of spinning
404140	405140	and you know.
405140	408140	I was like, I'm going to rock it talking to people tonight.
408140	413140	Can I- have we told the story or can I ask you to tell the story about Roll Call?
413140	414140	And you know what I'm talking about?
414140	415140	The guy-
415140	416140	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
416140	417140	The guy who subverted Roll Call?
417140	420140	Yeah, well that all- yeah, that takes place at the same school.
420140	421140	I just wanted to tell the story.
421140	423140	I don't know- I don't think it's a good story.
423140	425140	So buckle up.
425140	427140	Sade reminded me of this.
427140	428140	Sade.
428140	433140	So I was in this computer specialty school and I was in my one computer class.
433140	435140	I was taught by this guy named Mr. Blanchett.
435140	442140	He caught a girl slipping another girl a note or something.
442140	448140	And so he did that awesome thing where you take the note and then he read it out loud.
448140	454140	And it was just some- it was like- the girl was making fun of some other kid in the class
454140	460140	by going, oh I know you love Ronald.
460140	464140	I know he gives you the sweetest taboo.
464140	467140	And he's face turned purple.
467140	470140	And he's like, you don't even know what that means.
470140	472140	You know, I ain't even talking about that.
472140	473140	You're 13 years old.
473140	475140	You don't even know what that means.
475140	477140	I was like, no one knows what that means.
477140	481140	You're not a real Sade fan.
481140	482140	Exactly.
482140	483140	One of the hardest course-
483140	486140	I've been to four of her concerts.
486140	489140	I'm pretty sure it means fucking.
489140	490140	Probably.
490140	494140	And no one knows what that means more than a bunch of 13 year olds.
494140	500140	We're coming in our pants by reading math books at that age.
500140	503140	The school smelled like Gen Con.
503140	510140	There was so much testosterone and estrogen bursting out of us.
510140	516140	Our faces were festooned with hormonal acne and all of us were running into dark corners
516140	519140	to touch ourselves every chance we got.
519140	522140	I think we know what the sweetest taboo is.
522140	525140	I think it's fucking.
525140	530140	In that same school, because you requested the story-
530140	537140	This one is by request.
537140	538140	We were taking roll call-
538140	540140	We're going to play sexy music over this.
540140	542140	We were taking roll call in this math class.
542140	543140	The teacher said-
543140	544140	It was the beginning of the school year.
544140	547140	And the teacher said, I'll call your name.
547140	549140	You say here if you're here.
549140	554140	Also, if you have a name that you prefer to be called, you can let me know then.
554140	556140	And what she meant is what happened.
556140	557140	I'd be like-
557140	559140	She'd say, LaShonda Johnson.
559140	562140	And then LaShonda would say, here.
562140	563140	Shonda's fine.
563140	565140	Okay, Shonda.
565140	571140	And Dion Nash here.
571140	572140	You call me Dee.
572140	573140	Dee.
573140	574140	Okay, great.
575140	576140	And then she calls us-
576140	580140	One guy's name was Trevor Smith.
580140	586140	And this kid goes, you may call me Royal Champagne.
586140	591140	Just a 12 year old kid.
591140	595140	And she went, no.
595140	597140	Royal Champagne.
597140	599140	So good.
599140	602140	If I'd have been that teacher, I would have said, all right.
602140	604140	I called him up to the board every time.
604140	607140	What's the square root of 151?
607140	610140	Royal Champagne, would you treat us?
610140	612140	She was probably scared.
612140	614140	You never knew back then.
614140	617140	They had to have rules against magic markers.
617140	618140	It was such an odd thing.
618140	625140	I don't know if this was a place in time or if this is true for 12 and 13 year olds in middle school.
625140	628140	But everyone was obsessed with gangs.
628140	630140	None of us were in any.
631140	639140	But everyone was like, they were always drawing little pitchfork symbols and stars that were gang symbols for the local Milwaukee gangs on the walls.
639140	641140	This is junior high school?
641140	643140	This is junior high, yeah.
643140	651140	Nobody in that school was rolling with the two seven boys, which was one of the local gangs from 27th Street.
651140	656140	The Black Gangster Disciples, PGD, and their symbol was like a little pitchfork.
656140	659140	I'm holding up my hand to form a little pitchfork.
660140	662140	That reminds me of the story.
662140	666140	We were in metal shop and then the teacher put on a slide projector.
666140	672140	And then just like 85 pitchfork shadows come into the thing, including me probably.
672140	673140	Because it just became a thing.
673140	674140	It was like that and beatboxing.
674140	675140	We were all just doing it.
675140	676140	It was the culture.
676140	683140	People were walking down the hall just going, you just did it all the time.
683140	684140	Wait, wait, wait.
684140	685140	That was pretty good.
685140	686140	Yeah.
686140	688140	I went to Steuben.
695140	696140	No one actually did that.
696140	698140	Don't extend yourself, man.
698140	699140	Yeah, yeah.
699140	702140	Well, no, that's the hacky thing.
702140	704140	My mom, I used to come home and do that.
704140	705140	My mom's in pressure.
705140	708140	She'd go, will you stop doing that with the upstah, upstah, upstah, upstah.
710140	714140	There's not a white guy in this room that hasn't tried his hand at beatbox at some point.
714140	715140	We've all tried it.
715140	716140	Yeah.
716140	717140	We've all tried it.
717140	721140	I'm darn good at it in a pinch.
721140	723140	So let's see.
723140	724140	There was a bunch.
724140	725140	Oh, yeah.
725140	731140	So all these pitchfork shadows come into the slide projector's illumination.
731140	735140	And then you just hear this guy, John Morse, who was this big, tall.
735140	737140	He seemed like he was nine feet tall.
737140	741140	He was one of those beanpole sprouters.
741140	744140	And he was kind of like, I think he was a little touched.
744140	747140	I think he was one of those kids who slips through the cracks.
747140	751140	Like, he wasn't special enough to take advantage of being special.
751140	758140	He was just, you know, you just felt like he was destined for bad times or Verizon employment.
758140	761140	You know, like, he's just going to end up.
761140	766140	And he would just sit in the class and beatbox and do his pitchforks.
766140	769140	And I'm like, yeah, all those shadows came in.
769140	773140	And then the shop teacher's like, okay, we're going to watch a film strip.
773140	775140	And he said, all right, all right, all right.
775140	777140	He's so sick of seeing pitchfork shadows.
777140	780140	And then you just hear John Morse is the last one in there.
780140	785140	And you see his other hand come in and physically straighten his own fingers.
785140	787140	Like, he's perfecting his pitchfork.
787140	793140	And then you just hear John Morse in the dark metal shop room go, damn, my pitchfork's straight.
793140	795140	Which was not a thing.
795140	799140	It was not a – he was – no one cared how straight your pitchforks were.
799140	804140	That's a 13-year-old brain, you know.
804140	807140	It's sad, really, because it's like this gang culture.
807140	811140	All kids are pure of heart and just want to have fun and do things better.
811140	814140	We just want to play video games and fuck around.
814140	817140	Pitchforks.
817140	820140	My car might get blown up by the Black Gangster Disciples tonight.
820140	821140	I don't know.
821140	824140	I don't know if they're comfortable with me talking about them.
824140	828140	One of their sayings was false flag is a fag.
828140	829140	Ooh.
829140	833140	Yeah, you weren't supposed to throw up pitchforks if you weren't actually in B.G.D.
833140	835140	That's false flagging.
835140	840140	I went to public school in Los Angeles during the late 80s and early 90s,
840140	843140	and that's when everybody was in a gang, like for real.
843140	844140	And you went to a party.
844140	847140	You could go to a party in like a lower-class neighborhood,
847140	850140	a working-class, middle-class, upper-class neighborhood,
850140	855140	and gangs would come, like Compton Crips, like Bloods would come,
855140	859140	like big, bad, gun-toting, bad motherfuckers would show up.
859140	863140	And we were all just like nerds and like I used to wear like,
863140	868140	because I was like a bodyboarder and I had dreadlocks.
868140	869140	Hey, man.
869140	870140	It was 1987.
870140	871140	You guys weren't there.
871140	873140	I had like natural dreadlocks.
873140	874140	I also had a tan.
874140	875140	Picture that.
875140	878140	I mean, even us in Milwaukee were into the Ocean Pacific culture,
878140	881140	and you really lived on Ocean Pacific.
881140	884140	I would wear like a little like bandana, but I was smart enough.
884140	886140	You couldn't wear like eight colors.
886140	888140	There were eight colors that if you wore,
888140	890140	someone would come up to you and grab it.
890140	894140	And I was like at an arcade bowling alley kind of thing,
894140	899140	and I walked outside, and I had like a green like bandana on,
899140	901140	like, you know, kind of tied in the back,
901140	902140	like I don't know what I was doing.
902140	904140	And I got jumped by 12 guys, and they just came up
904140	907140	and just like kicked me in the chest, knocked me down.
907140	908140	I'm all alone.
908140	910140	I was, you know, I'm six foot four now,
910140	913140	but I was five foot four as a freshman in high school.
913140	914140	I grew ten and a half inches.
914140	918140	So I was very little and very skinny.
918140	920140	And these six Latino guys jumped me,
920140	922140	and the main alpha dude walks up,
922140	924140	and he grabs my bandana off, and he goes,
924140	927140	yo, bro, you want your rag back?
927140	930140	You got to claim it back from cactus bunch.
930140	934140	What in the fuck?
934140	941140	What in the strawberry shortcake unicorn mythology cactus?
941140	942140	What?
942140	943140	Cactus pickles?
943140	944140	What were they called?
944140	945140	Amen.
945140	947140	It was the first I'd heard of them.
947140	948140	What did you say?
948140	950140	The cactus bunch.
950140	951140	Bunch?
951140	953140	Don't call your gang a bunch.
953140	957140	That's like a Don Knotts Tim Conway movie.
957140	958140	A bunch?
958140	961140	I'm not saying it was the toughest gang in town.
961140	966140	I'm saying there was 14 of them, and they had my rag.
966140	968140	The guy took the fucking bandana off,
968140	969140	and he goes, you want this back?
969140	971140	You got to claim it from cactus brunch.
971140	974140	Brunch.
974140	975140	Cactus brunch.
975140	977140	Cactus brunch was even more dangerous.
977140	979140	Their wives were...
979140	982140	They met at the Beller Hotel every Sunday.
982140	987140	Little cucumber sandwiches, and they would just talk shit.
987140	990140	They said, claim it from cactus bunch,
990140	992140	and I was like, hey, man, I found that.
992140	993140	It's yours to keep.
993140	996140	It gets too cold in Milwaukee for people to be that violent.
996140	999140	We all have to hibernate.
1000140	1003140	We have to save our energy.
1003140	1004140	Yeah.
1004140	1007140	Oh, by the way, my apologies to the Black Angster Disciples,
1007140	1008140	the Two Seven Boys...
1008140	1009140	Cactus bunch.
1009140	1011140	And the cactus bunch, especially the cactus bunch,
1011140	1013140	because we really took them...
1013140	1017140	I want the cactus bunch members that are listening to the podcast
1017140	1022140	to know my issue is not with your manhood.
1022140	1026140	It's simply with your nomenclature.
1026140	1031140	It's your ability to name your gang properly that I question.
1031140	1034140	I don't question your ability to murder me.
1034140	1035140	Cactus bunch.
1035140	1038140	It's so adorable.
1038140	1041140	We're the hug-a-bunch.
1041140	1044140	There's a really old-school gang in Los Angeles called,
1044140	1047140	Las Cantaranas, which is the Singing Frogs.
1047140	1050140	But they're a really old, like, you know,
1050140	1051140	veterano gang.
1051140	1052140	All right.
1052140	1054140	Well, my hat's off to them.
1055140	1057140	Rags at half-masks.
1057140	1060140	Pitchfork straight.
1060140	1061140	Let's get off this topic.
1061140	1064140	I feel like I'm going to get in trouble.
1064140	1066140	But speaking of bummers, tonight is going to be a bummer.
1066140	1069140	That's why I got fashion and style advice questions from you guys.
1069140	1070140	It's not because...
1070140	1073140	It's because I wanted to commit to tonight being a bummer.
1073140	1074140	I'm very hungover.
1074140	1076140	I went to a bachelor party last night.
1076140	1079140	Like I told you, I woke up this morning and I knew
1079140	1081140	I'm not going to be funny tonight.
1081140	1083140	I'm not going to be insightful.
1083140	1087140	I am only going to waste your time and steal your $10.
1087140	1091140	So I wanted to just be above board about that.
1091140	1094140	And so for the questions that we got from the audience tonight,
1094140	1098140	they're on a topic that I am bound to fail at speaking to,
1098140	1100140	which is style and fashion.
1100140	1104140	I picked the worst topic that I could think of to commit
1104140	1107140	to tonight being the worst harm in town ever.
1107140	1108140	So buckle up.
1108140	1110140	And if you're listening at home, stop.
1110140	1114140	And someone from our audience asks,
1114140	1118140	why do all girls think they can wear leggings?
1118140	1121140	What does that mean?
1121140	1122140	Because they can.
1126140	1128140	Young man?
1128140	1131140	Well, aren't they kind of a one size fits all?
1131140	1133140	Are leggings just like...
1133140	1135140	Aren't they just like tights without feet?
1135140	1137140	I think that someone's saying that some people wear them
1137140	1140140	to greater acclaim and success than other people.
1140140	1141140	Well, that's everything.
1141140	1142140	That's all clothes.
1142140	1145140	See, I'm already pissed off at this category.
1145140	1147140	What the hell are you talking about?
1147140	1148140	You chose the topic.
1148140	1151140	Like, that's not the tyranny of hot people.
1151140	1153140	It's like, you know...
1153140	1156140	If you look good, you can wear a towel.
1156140	1161140	Like, why do you have to also, in addition to that, like...
1161140	1164140	Ugh, you know, ugly people are the ones
1164140	1166140	who should be caring the most about clothes.
1166140	1169140	You know, you shouldn't go, oh, her ass is too fat.
1169140	1170140	She shouldn't be wearing those pants.
1170140	1174140	Fuck you, you bad person.
1177140	1179140	I told you, I'm not...
1179140	1180140	I wasn't kidding, man.
1180140	1183140	I'm not on all four cylinders tonight.
1183140	1185140	I'm on two.
1185140	1187140	So why...
1187140	1188140	Because they can.
1188140	1189140	They can wear leggings.
1189140	1191140	Shame on you.
1191140	1195140	You snarky David Spade type.
1195140	1198140	All right, Dan.
1199140	1201140	Let's see you in a pair of leggings.
1201140	1204140	Miss Thang?
1204140	1205140	Or Mr...
1205140	1208140	The next question, if you were a lady...
1208140	1211140	I will say this, sorry.
1211140	1212140	Here's a good question.
1212140	1214140	Here's the question that should be asked.
1214140	1215140	Why did you some women...
1215140	1218140	How do you find out as a woman, when do you learn,
1218140	1221140	who tells you, what newsletter do you get that tells you
1221140	1224140	that you can't just wear tights as pants?
1224140	1227140	You ever go to the mall and you just see some lady
1227140	1229140	who didn't get the telegram?
1229140	1230140	She's just wearing...
1230140	1233140	It's so jarring visually.
1233140	1236140	So it's like, you're just not wearing any pants.
1236140	1238140	Those are underwear.
1238140	1240140	And you're just wearing them like...
1240140	1243140	Is it just like a thing that you see someone else doing it
1243140	1244140	and then you do it?
1244140	1246140	Someone has to...
1246140	1249140	Tights aren't pants for sure, I know that.
1249140	1252140	That's not like a no white after Labor Day thing.
1252140	1258140	That's like a you can't just wear underwear for pants.
1258140	1260140	Those are tights.
1260140	1261140	But you love tights.
1261140	1263140	Yeah, I do, but I like them because...
1263140	1264140	Tights aren't really...
1264140	1267140	Just wearing a pair of tights walking around the mall isn't...
1267140	1269140	That's not flattering on anybody.
1269140	1270140	You could be...
1270140	1273140	I'm going to date myself, Cindy Crawford.
1274140	1275140	Who's hot now?
1275140	1276140	Who's the...
1276140	1277140	Kate Moss.
1277140	1279140	You could be Kate Moss.
1282140	1283140	Let's get lost tonight.
1283140	1286140	You could be my black Kate Moss tonight.
1290140	1292140	Dan, if you were a lady...
1292140	1293140	Somebody asks...
1293140	1295140	And I am.
1295140	1298140	What kind of dress would you wear?
1298140	1300140	Oh, that's a good question.
1301140	1303140	If I were a lady, I would...
1303140	1308140	I think I would dress a lot like the beautiful redheaded poet girl
1308140	1311140	from Head of the Class.
1311140	1314140	I think I would have a kind of like Laura Ingalls Wilder,
1314140	1317140	kind of bohemian, Edie Brickell kind of...
1317140	1323140	I think I'd wear a lot of very long skirts with...
1323140	1325140	Now you're dating yourself.
1325140	1329140	With tights and like a cardigan sweater.
1329140	1332140	You're like a horny ice man.
1332140	1336140	Your boner is frozen in like 1987.
1336140	1337140	Oh, man.
1337140	1338140	It really is.
1338140	1343140	For Pornography, while other people are going to the U-Porn
1343140	1347140	and the pornhub.coms, I will often...
1347140	1349140	Believe me, I will go there too.
1349140	1354140	But I will often go to YouTube and just type in like aerobics.
1356140	1358140	And it's enough for me.
1360140	1365140	Cynthia Karoluk was a Canadian fitness lady.
1367140	1369140	And she was just 80s...
1369140	1371140	She was in Cactus Bunch, wasn't she?
1372140	1379140	She would pronounce a boot wrong and tell you how to exercise.
1379140	1384140	She'd wear like these leotards and cross trainers
1384140	1388140	and white socks and tights, pantyhose, whatever.
1388140	1390140	What is your obsession with...
1390140	1393140	I like stockings, but for some reason tights less so.
1393140	1398140	I can't qualify why that is, but you love tights and leggings.
1398140	1401140	I like women.
1401140	1404140	I like that they're soft and fun to touch.
1405140	1408140	I want them to be...
1408140	1410140	I like the...
1410140	1411140	You know, it's weird.
1411140	1415140	Fetishes are weird because there's a logic to them to a certain degree,
1415140	1417140	but then there's just some weird...
1417140	1420140	Something happened to me when I was six years old or something.
1420140	1425140	A lot of people who have feet fetishes or nylon fetishes,
1425140	1429140	they'll have memories of playing under the table with their matchbox cars
1429140	1433140	and their aunt was crossing and uncrossing their legs.
1433140	1436140	They'll have a visceral memory of some sexual awakening for them.
1436140	1439140	And I think what it is is that I think your brain just pops like popcorn.
1439140	1443140	I think there's a certain point as a primate that you're just walking down the street
1443140	1446140	and you're going to turn into a sexual entity.
1446140	1449140	And unfortunately, whatever you're looking at,
1449140	1451140	whatever's around you, you're going to...
1451140	1454140	Okay, he's a chocolate file.
1454140	1456140	He's a Hersha file.
1456140	1458140	I don't remember what era it would have been,
1458140	1460140	but I'm pretty sure I drove one of my...
1460140	1463140	Either my old crappy Volkswagen or my shitty Honda.
1463140	1467140	And I drove you to Sunset and La Brea to...
1467140	1469140	Was it a Wendy's or an El Pollo?
1469140	1472140	Oh man, this is a little embarrassing.
1472140	1474140	Yeah, okay, go ahead.
1474140	1477140	Yes, you drove me to buy...
1477140	1479140	This is before the internet was really a thing.
1479140	1482140	You drove me to buy...
1482140	1484140	I had a range...
1484140	1488140	It was like going to a drug deal.
1488140	1492140	I had a range to buy VHS tapes from a guy who was in town,
1492140	1494140	who on the internet...
1494140	1498140	The internet existed, but it wasn't like a place where you could watch video yet.
1498140	1502140	That didn't happen until Rob Schwab and I invented it with Channel 101.
1502140	1506140	Do you want to explain what VHS tapes are?
1506140	1509140	They're these giant cassettes.
1509140	1512140	Shut up.
1512140	1518140	You drove me to a clandestine meeting with a guy who made videos of women
1518140	1524140	just basically wearing tights and pantyhose and hanging out.
1524140	1526140	It doesn't even count as pornography.
1526140	1529140	There's a certain breed of video I watch where it's like...
1529140	1533140	It'll just be a woman at a desk just going like,
1533140	1535140	Hello, sir.
1535140	1537140	Do you want me to hold your calls?
1537140	1539140	And then she just kind of crosses her legs and...
1539140	1541140	It's called James Bond.
1541140	1543140	And then they start disrobing and I just...
1543140	1544140	Next day.
1544140	1545140	But a guy like...
1545140	1548140	You got out of my car and we're at the Wendy's or El Pollo Loco
1548140	1550140	or whatever it was, Sunset and La Brea,
1550140	1552140	and I'm waiting in the car like,
1552140	1554140	Shit, something's about to go bad, man.
1554140	1556140	I got a bad feeling about this.
1556140	1561140	I came out with a ratty old cardboard box full of VHS tapes.
1561140	1566140	Well, because I'm not going to buy one, so I bought all of them.
1566140	1568140	It wouldn't make sense to buy one.
1568140	1570140	It's like, okay, how many do you have?
1570140	1573140	And at the time I was just kind of rolling in heat vision and Jack money.
1573140	1574140	I didn't know what to do.
1574140	1576140	I was living in a one-bedroom apartment in Hollywood.
1576140	1584140	My rent was $550 a month and I had $300,000 just sitting in a pile.
1584140	1585140	What do I do?
1585140	1586140	What do I do?
1586140	1587140	What do I do?
1587140	1588140	What do I...
1588140	1589140	Will Koch's apartment?
1589140	1590140	Yeah, Will Koch's.
1590140	1592140	That apartment was amazing because it was a little like...
1592140	1594140	8-unit apartment building.
1594140	1598140	This regular old Hollywood apartment building and you walked in
1598140	1601140	and Dan had bought the world's biggest desk.
1601140	1603140	The desk was most of the room, right?
1603140	1605140	Yeah, it was almost as big as my living room.
1605140	1607140	And Dan, at that point in his life,
1607140	1609140	had decided he was going to be like Einstein
1609140	1611140	and wear the same outfit every day.
1611140	1613140	Seth Brundle.
1613140	1616140	So yeah, he'd gone to Sears and bought like what?
1616140	1618140	Like a dozen of the same blue shirts.
1618140	1622140	Yeah, these baby blue short sleeve button shirts
1622140	1625140	and like six black ties.
1625140	1627140	So if he went to visit Dan,
1627140	1629140	it looked like he went to go visit the manager
1629140	1631140	of the local Albertsons.
1631140	1633140	Except there was porn.
1633140	1635140	Just like Gus from Breaking Bad.
1635140	1639140	But there was porn, Mountain Dew and pizza boxes everywhere.
1639140	1640140	Yeah.
1640140	1641140	It was amazing.
1641140	1642140	And a little mannequin parts and things.
1642140	1644140	So I never got to see that.
1644140	1645140	Hidden away in his bedroom,
1645140	1647140	there was the only part of Dan's life that had any shame
1647140	1650140	that he wouldn't allow everybody to see.
1650140	1652140	Like I went toward the bedroom.
1652140	1655140	You kind of demurred one time when I went toward the bedroom.
1655140	1656140	And like, no, no, no, no.
1656140	1658140	That's the menagerie.
1658140	1660140	That's what Rob called it.
1660140	1661140	The menagerie.
1661140	1663140	What was the menagerie?
1663140	1665140	Look, I was trying to figure out who I was
1665140	1668140	and what I was into.
1668140	1673140	I knew it had something to do with legs and nylon.
1673140	1675140	And cadavers.
1675140	1678140	Well, you certainly would have a strong case
1678140	1682140	for profiling me as a serial killer back then.
1682140	1685140	I've since moved on, and I date human women now,
1685140	1687140	and everything's fine.
1687140	1691140	But yeah, I was like, well, my thing was,
1691140	1692140	I was a serial monogamist.
1692140	1694140	I kept getting into these relationships.
1694140	1696140	I kept wasting women's time.
1696140	1698140	And then it always ended in heartbreak.
1698140	1701140	And I was like, you know, I sure like jerking off.
1701140	1705140	And if I can just figure out how to do it perfectly,
1705140	1709140	if I can just be the Chuck Yagger of masturbation,
1709140	1712140	if I can figure out what it is that really flips my switches,
1712140	1714140	and then just be happy.
1714140	1717140	That was the whole point behind getting the shirts.
1717140	1720140	There was a reading Campbell's Hero of the Thousand Faces
1720140	1722140	for the first time, and I was becoming obsessive.
1722140	1725140	I was drawing circles everywhere and trying to figure out
1725140	1727140	and simplify the story model.
1727140	1729140	I was self-actualized.
1729140	1737140	I admired that mannequin fucking Gus Fring serial killer.
1737140	1740140	What comprised the menagerie?
1740140	1744140	At one point, I bought a mannequin
1744140	1746140	to see what that would be like.
1746140	1747140	A full-body mannequin?
1747140	1748140	Yeah.
1748140	1749140	Where do you go to buy a mannequin?
1749140	1754140	Online, I ordered it from a mannequin warehouse.
1754140	1758140	Did you pretend to be like a fashion designer or something?
1758140	1759140	I don't know.
1759140	1762140	I fell back on the idea that what I was doing was so weird
1762140	1764140	that no one would ever suspect, no one would ever go,
1764140	1767140	hey, are you going to fuck this?
1767140	1768140	Who would think that?
1768140	1769140	I'm weird.
1769140	1773140	I bet that amounts to like 50% of their mannequin sales.
1773140	1776140	I read stuff about, there's a whole branch of fetish
1776140	1779140	that's like, you know, and there was a story in the paper.
1779140	1781140	There's no such thing as paper anymore,
1781140	1783140	but there was a story online.
1783140	1785140	I remember reading about a guy who got arrested
1785140	1787140	because for the third time or something,
1787140	1791140	he smashed a display window of a certain story.
1791140	1793140	He was in love with a mannequin.
1793140	1797140	There was one specific one that he kept abducting.
1797140	1801140	He would rather break the law than go home without her.
1801140	1805140	But did the mannequin keep escaping and go back to work?
1805140	1807140	Why did he have to do it three times?
1807140	1809140	Well, because as soon as there was no one around,
1809140	1811140	she would turn into Kim Cottrell.
1811140	1812140	No, I don't know.
1812140	1814140	I think they would catch him because he was better
1814140	1816140	at loving mannequins than he was a criminal.
1816140	1818140	I mean, I don't think he was, if he was a good criminal,
1818140	1821140	if his passion was for crime, he would have robbed a bank.
1821140	1823140	He was just so horny for this mannequin
1823140	1826140	that he was breaking glass and he was getting caught
1826140	1828140	because it's probably hard to abscond with those things.
1828140	1830140	Isn't there a mannequin in Silver Lake or Los Feliz
1830140	1831140	that you have a thing for?
1831140	1832140	Say what?
1832140	1834140	Isn't there a mannequin that you have a little crush on?
1834140	1839140	Well, no, that's McGathey's jealous of this mannequin
1839140	1840140	on Hillhurst.
1840140	1844140	There's a record store and there's a mannequin in the window
1844140	1847140	that's like sitting in like a reclining chair
1847140	1850140	and she's listening to headphones and she has a red wig on.
1850140	1855140	So pretty sweet, but her bit is when we walk past it,
1855140	1857140	she gets jealous of the mannequin.
1857140	1858140	That's her bit.
1858140	1860140	I'm over mannequins now, man.
1860140	1863140	I love the real thing.
1863140	1866140	I wasn't really into mannequins per se.
1866140	1872140	I was trying to become the most self-reliant man in the world.
1872140	1875140	I was trying to, as long as we're here,
1875140	1878140	as long as we're down at the bottom of this fucking circle,
1878140	1879140	I'll say it.
1879140	1882140	I bought a real doll, one of those things online.
1882140	1884140	It's like a $5,000.
1884140	1887140	I think somebody just gasped.
1887140	1889140	It's pretty extreme shit.
1889140	1892140	It costs a lot of money and then they send you a giant crate
1892140	1895140	and there's a fake woman in a box.
1896140	1898140	It's a sex doll.
1898140	1899140	I bought one.
1899140	1902140	Rob Shrob and I didn't see you for three months.
1902140	1903140	When you did...
1903140	1905140	You had a big smile on your face.
1905140	1911140	It was the best relationship that I had had to date at that time.
1911140	1915140	I think it was an important thing because sometimes you talk to people
1915140	1917140	and they're like, I can't be in a relationship.
1917140	1921140	It has something to do with loss of control and all this stuff.
1921140	1924140	Figure out who you are and what you want.
1924140	1925140	Get to the bottom of your circle.
1925140	1929140	I think there would be less sexual crime and victimization
1929140	1933140	and objectification of women if men would be a little more indulgent
1933140	1937140	with themselves of what they really were thinking and wanting
1937140	1940140	so that they didn't have all this shame that had to get redirected
1940140	1942140	and come out at weird times
1942140	1945140	with the people that had the misfortune of running across their path.
1945140	1950140	I looked at it like I was just looking for the perfect backscratcher
1950140	1953140	to scratch this itch because I was becoming so ashamed of myself
1953140	1954140	for dating women.
1954140	1957140	I was like, you know that this relationship isn't going to work.
1957140	1958140	Stop doing this.
1958140	1960140	Stop putting yourself out there.
1960140	1963140	When you know that something is going to end with someone else being hurt
1963140	1965140	and you do it anyway, then you're a bad person.
1965140	1966140	Figure your shit out.
1966140	1968140	What do you like?
1968140	1970140	And the answer is...
1970140	1977140	Angora sweaters and nylon.
1977140	1979140	So is that what you would wear?
1979140	1980140	Was that what...
1980140	1981140	Was that a real lady?
1981140	1983140	Is that what you would wear?
1983140	1985140	Yeah, I would do that too, but only at home.
1985140	1986140	I wouldn't go out in it.
1986140	1989140	I would roll around on the bed in it.
1989140	1992140	If I was a woman, I would just buy a bunch of outfits
1992140	1995140	and roll around on the bed and look at myself in a mirror.
1995140	1998140	But I think that's all guys would think that because they'd be like,
1998140	1999140	oh, I'm a woman.
1999140	2000140	I'm a human playboy.
2000140	2004140	I was dating a girl one time and I told her I liked stockings
2004140	2006140	so she wore a fishnet stockings.
2007140	2011140	During the course of our interplay or intercourse,
2011140	2013140	they were torn a little bit.
2013140	2015140	So the next morning she left my apartment
2015140	2018140	and then she threw them out in the trash can by my bed.
2018140	2020140	So she left and went to work and I'm there
2020140	2021140	and there's these stockings in there.
2021140	2023140	And I had never put stockings on before.
2023140	2027140	I thought, well, I'm into stockings.
2027140	2030140	If I'm going to jump in the pool, let's touch the bottom.
2030140	2032140	Let's find out.
2033140	2035140	I'm not going to not put them on
2035140	2038140	and wonder if maybe that's where I'm going with this.
2038140	2039140	That's what I'm saying.
2039140	2043140	If I'm Tim Curry from Rocky Horror.
2043140	2045140	Why are you expressing all this?
2045140	2046140	I'm not.
2046140	2047140	Just me and wonderment.
2047140	2048140	That's what I was doing.
2048140	2050140	I was trying to figure out, where does this lead?
2050140	2051140	Where does this end?
2051140	2052140	Where does this go?
2052140	2055140	So I put them on and it felt pretty good.
2055140	2057140	You put them on and they feel kind of sexy.
2057140	2059140	That's part of what stockings are about.
2059140	2060140	I don't know why I like them so much.
2060140	2061140	But I put them on.
2061140	2063140	I've got knobby knees and I've got hairy legs.
2063140	2064140	They didn't look good.
2064140	2066140	I didn't have sexy legs.
2066140	2068140	But they felt kind of good putting on.
2068140	2069140	I was like, oh, that's cool.
2069140	2070140	I like that.
2070140	2073140	I like them better on women's legs than my own.
2073140	2074140	So I took them off.
2074140	2077140	I posed and primped and preened a little bit
2077140	2078140	in front of the mirror.
2078140	2080140	I gave it a full college try
2080140	2082140	and then I took them off and I threw them up.
2082140	2084140	And I told my girlfriend, I said,
2084140	2086140	you know, I pulled your stockings out of the garbage
2086140	2087140	and I tried them on.
2087140	2088140	I said, goddamn it.
2088140	2089140	I knew it.
2089140	2090140	I knew it.
2090140	2092140	I was going to take them with me.
2092140	2093140	I knew you'd put them on.
2093140	2094140	I was like.
2094140	2095140	All right.
2095140	2096140	Yeah.
2096140	2097140	I didn't like it.
2097140	2099140	You know what I did once
2099140	2101140	that I've never told anybody except for the...
2101140	2102140	Oh, brother.
2102140	2103140	I never told anybody this
2103140	2105140	except for the community writers room
2105140	2107140	because I encouraged to kind of like
2107140	2109140	write what you know, explore yourselves,
2109140	2111140	like confess things
2111140	2113140	and let's write episodes about these things.
2114140	2115140	I...
2116140	2117140	Okay.
2119140	2120140	The story...
2120140	2123140	You could cut the tension with a knife in here right now.
2123140	2125140	Well, yeah, because there's absolutely no...
2125140	2126140	Isn't that a refreshing thing, though?
2126140	2129140	To not know for sure that what I'm about to say
2129140	2132140	isn't going to make your eyes fall out of your head.
2132140	2134140	You really don't know what I'm about to say
2134140	2138140	because I have established that I might say anything.
2138140	2139140	I used to fuck a plastic lady,
2139140	2141140	but here's something I never told anybody.
2144140	2145140	Thank you.
2146140	2147140	Yeah.
2151140	2155140	The story ends with a Sharpie pen up my ass.
2158140	2161140	It begins innocently enough.
2165140	2167140	Take us to the hero's journey of this.
2167140	2169140	Can you make this Ken Bellion for us?
2169140	2172140	It begins in Milwaukee with Schwab.
2172140	2175140	Schwab is the longest friend that I currently have.
2175140	2176140	He's...
2176140	2178140	All of the friends that I have now,
2178140	2180140	Schwab is the guy I've known the longest.
2180140	2181140	We met in Milwaukee.
2181140	2183140	I was 17 when I met Schwab.
2185140	2188140	Schwab told me once.
2188140	2190140	We started bonding about it.
2190140	2191140	It was like, well...
2192140	2194140	Man, I really like jerking off.
2194140	2195140	Yeah, me too.
2197140	2198140	We were friends.
2198140	2200140	We communicated with each other.
2201140	2203140	We would shower together.
2203140	2204140	No, I'm kidding.
2206140	2208140	Schwab said,
2208140	2211140	do you know the thing about the prostate, right?
2214140	2215140	And I said, no.
2215140	2218140	What is the thing about the prostate?
2218140	2220140	Should we get Rob up here to do his power?
2220140	2222140	Well, we'll get him up in a second.
2222140	2224140	I'm going to tell his butthole story.
2224140	2227140	I guess this night just went to a weird black hole.
2227140	2229140	It was about darkness.
2229140	2230140	You said it.
2230140	2232140	Yeah, I guess, but it's kind of joyful.
2232140	2234140	I don't mind it so much.
2234140	2236140	It's a little relieving.
2238140	2240140	I hope no one from CBS or Fox is here.
2247140	2250140	You know what's really weird is that...
2250140	2252140	I don't know if he minds me saying this.
2252140	2254140	Henry Kissinger's son is in the room.
2254140	2255140	What?
2256140	2257140	All right.
2260140	2261140	Okay.
2262140	2264140	Rob goes, you know when you're jerking off...
2264140	2266140	You can't just pass by that.
2270140	2272140	All right, go on, go on.
2273140	2278140	You're about to tell a sharpie up the butt story to Henry Kissinger's son.
2279140	2283140	Schwab tells you, yeah, when you're coming,
2283140	2287140	you rub the, you know, what we would call the taint,
2287140	2289140	what we would come to call the taint,
2289140	2292140	when we achieved that kind of word power.
2293140	2295140	Rob's like, you know, you rub that part.
2295140	2297140	When you're coming, it feels better.
2297140	2298140	Come harder.
2298140	2300140	Why do you keep looking at me?
2301140	2302140	Who am I supposed to look at?
2302140	2303140	The audience.
2303140	2305140	That girl like that?
2305140	2307140	That fella?
2307140	2309140	Who should I look at?
2309140	2311140	Well, you chose me for certain.
2311140	2313140	Oh, I thought I could trust you.
2314140	2316140	I'll just stare into lights.
2316140	2319140	Dan, look at me while you tell this story.
2320140	2322140	So Rob said, when you're coming, you know,
2322140	2329140	you rub the area between your butt and your balls.
2329140	2331140	It's a thing.
2331140	2333140	It feels a little better.
2333140	2335140	And I was like, I wonder why that is.
2335140	2336140	What is that?
2336140	2337140	There's a magic button there.
2337140	2339140	I did a little research.
2339140	2341140	At the local library?
2342140	2344140	Actually, it just happened upon it.
2344140	2347140	I think it was like a penthouse magazine or something.
2347140	2351140	This is a pre-internet world of delightful,
2351140	2353140	periodical literature.
2353140	2357140	And there was some guy who wrote in a letter to Playboy
2357140	2359140	or Penthouse or something and said,
2359140	2364140	Dear Playboy, my girlfriend was pleasuring me
2364140	2368140	and she rubbed the area that Shrob was talking about.
2368140	2370140	Rob Shrob.
2371140	2373140	What happened?
2373140	2375140	Rob Shrob, Taint Master?
2378140	2381140	That is a great direct-to-video movie.
2383140	2385140	Have you seen Taint Master 2?
2385140	2388140	Yeah, I didn't like it, but I heard
2388140	2390140	Taint Master 3 is going to pretend
2390140	2392140	Taint Master 2 didn't happen.
2392140	2394140	Which is cool, because I didn't like learning
2394140	2396140	that Taint Master was an alien.
2396140	2399140	I thought that he was a master of taints
2399140	2402140	and was earthbound and could speak to them
2402140	2404140	and see through their eyes.
2405140	2408140	I've got that poster, it's amazing.
2408140	2410140	Isn't it interesting that Mark Singer,
2410140	2412140	who was in Beast Master, he had a,
2412140	2414140	have you watched Beast Master?
2414140	2417140	He has a very visible, very clear,
2417140	2420140	what is it, it's a smallpox vaccination thing?
2420140	2422140	I just think that's interesting because it's like,
2422140	2424140	he's the Beast Master.
2424140	2428140	He's even a master of microscopic beasts.
2428140	2433140	Before anyone in this world had vaccinations, he did.
2433140	2437140	All right, you 25-year-old fuckers.
2437140	2440140	Maybe educate yourselves a little bit.
2440140	2442140	I don't want us to go down that road again.
2442140	2444140	Who is Eddie Perkel?
2447140	2449140	What's aerobics?
2450140	2453140	All right, so Rob Shrob is rubbing your taint.
2453140	2457140	That's not, that's where you left off.
2458140	2460140	Where are you left off?
2460140	2462140	It was Act Two.
2462140	2464140	I read a letter in a magazine.
2464140	2466140	It's a meeting with the goddess.
2467140	2470140	I read a letter in a magazine
2470140	2474140	where a guy wrote it into a magazine and said,
2474140	2477140	I, my girlfriend did this thing,
2477140	2481140	she rubbed this spot and something amazing happened.
2481140	2484140	What can you explain on the Dr. Sex
2484140	2487140	or whoever he was writing into said,
2487140	2491140	oh, she's stimulating your prostate gland.
2491140	2493140	That's what's happening.
2493140	2496140	Some people choose to do it internally.
2496140	2499140	That's why people stick stuff up their butt sometime.
2499140	2501140	That's what's, it's the same thing.
2501140	2506140	And so I thought, huh, like you with the fishnets,
2506140	2509140	what am I going to die not having,
2509140	2512140	what if, what if, how do you know?
2512140	2514140	I mean, what do you, what if it's my favorite thing?
2514140	2516140	What if I turn into the guy that loves it?
2516140	2518140	Why did you climb that mountain? Because it was there.
2518140	2520140	You hear about it sometimes.
2520140	2524140	You hear about guys liking the, liking stuff in their, their hoo-ha.
2524140	2528140	To dream the impossible dream.
2528140	2529140	So I.
2529140	2530140	To fight.
2530140	2533140	So at one point I'm, I'm going, I'm, I'm,
2533140	2536140	I'm sitting down for a personal session.
2536140	2538140	And.
2538140	2541140	Mr. Kissinger.
2541140	2546140	And, and, and, and, and I think to myself, uh, uh,
2546140	2548140	well, maybe, well, maybe this is the time I try to,
2548140	2551140	I'll try to, I'll try to put something in there and see if it's like magic,
2551140	2555140	you know, see if a genie comes out.
2559140	2562140	Go on.
2562140	2568140	So I looked around my house because I did, I thought, well,
2568140	2570140	I'm not going to put my finger in there.
2570140	2571140	Yeah.
2571140	2574140	Because it's, because it's a butt.
2574140	2577140	That's gross.
2577140	2581140	I don't want my, I don't want poopies on my finger.
2581140	2582140	This is for the ladies.
2582140	2586140	So I'm like, well, it's for an object time.
2586140	2592140	So I look around and I'm like, I landed on a, uh, sharpie pen.
2592140	2594140	Yeah.
2594140	2597140	Not, not the cap end, but the, just the, because the,
2597140	2599140	there's the regular just smooth white end.
2599140	2600140	That's what I'm talking about.
2600140	2604140	This is a, this is a, this is a good starter.
2604140	2607140	Start, start slow.
2607140	2610140	Maybe I'll end up putting a thermos up there, but, uh,
2610140	2611140	that's the spirit.
2611140	2614140	Let's find out.
2614140	2620140	Uh, and so I, you know, the end of the story is I have a sharpie pen
2620140	2628140	stuck up my ass and I came and it wasn't that big a deal.
2628140	2630140	Me, it might've been a little better.
2630140	2634140	I can't remember, but what I do remember very clearly is there's a thing with
2634140	2639140	guys, um, when God, this is something that's very amazing to me.
2639140	2643140	When guys have an orgasm, it is instantaneous.
2643140	2647140	Like whatever was in your bloodstream, whatever was in your brain that was
2647140	2654140	making you sexually pro, you know, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, excited, like it is.
2655140	2660140	Literally in an instant, like the moment of your orgasm, the guy, it's like the
2660140	2662140	thought of sex is like mowing the lawn.
2662140	2665140	It's, it's, it doesn't, it's everything goes away completely.
2665140	2670140	You go from being like Dr. Detroit to being Dan Aykroyd.
2670140	2671140	Wow.
2671140	2672140	Fuck you guys.
2672140	2676140	Just, just rent some shit.
2676140	2679140	Dr. Detroit.
2679140	2682140	Now I'm turned on again.
2682140	2687140	You go from being Mr. Hyde to back to having a PhD again, uh, as soon as you
2687140	2688140	orgasm.
2688140	2694140	So I came and I had a pin up my ass.
2696140	2698140	I was just, that is the sweetest taboo.
2698140	2700140	Thank you, sir.
2702140	2711140	Uh, I, I, I, there's nothing I said, you, you don't want like, like you'll do
2711140	2715140	almost anything when you're in that zone, like you'll, you'll, you'll, you'll,
2715140	2717140	it's, it does things to your mind and your, and your body.
2717140	2722140	But then when it's all over, you don't want any props involved that, that, that
2722140	2725140	are going to like take time and effort to deal with.
2725140	2732140	Like I hate, I was a man who, you know, I was back to being a normal stock broker.
2732140	2734140	I wasn't ever really a stock broker.
2734140	2737140	That would be embarrassing.
2737140	2740140	Uh, I had a pen up my ass and I had to pull it out.
2740140	2741140	Yeah.
2741140	2746140	Well, wouldn't you, wouldn't you rather I did, uh, you didn't want me to like pull
2746140	2749140	it out now and go, and here it is.
2749140	2754140	So when you come up after the show, golden railroad spike after the show,
2754140	2756140	Dan will be signing autographs and pictures.
2756140	2757140	Yes.
2757140	2761140	I told the community writers room that, and there was no end of Sharpie jokes.
2761140	2762140	Uh, yeah.
2762140	2765140	Well, do you want to hear some things on the docket for tonight?
2765140	2766140	All right.
2766140	2769140	We got to have Spencer come up our dungeon master.
2769140	2770140	Yeah.
2770140	2773140	We're going to have Spencer come up and he's going to just talk to us, you and me.
2773140	2775140	Spencer, whom we met last, uh, last week.
2775140	2776140	Yes.
2776140	2780140	I said, I brought a dungeon master up on stage who volunteered to talk to us about
2780140	2784140	Dungeons and Dragons and, and Spencer's going to come up, talk to us a little bit,
2784140	2789140	uh, about, about the kinds of characters we might like to play in a Dungeons and
2789140	2790140	Dragons game.
2790140	2792140	And then he'll, he'll take his seat.
2792140	2797140	Uh, there, there's a lovely commemorative Sharpie pen under it for him.
2798140	2804140	Uh, he, he, and then, and then next week, then he'll, I get, you know, present our
2804140	2809140	characters to us and that'll be another, you know, I got to try to, so it's a
2809140	2811140	weekly step-by-step baby steps.
2811140	2813140	I don't know where that's going to go.
2813140	2817140	Are we going to end up playing Dungeons and Dragons on the, on the podcast here at
2817140	2818140	Harmon town?
2818140	2823140	Will we three weeks from now, will we have a table up on stage and we'll just do a
2823140	2827140	little segment where we do a little, little, little baby chapter of an adventure
2827140	2828140	with a dungeon master?
2828140	2833140	Will Spencer be our dungeon master or, or having rolled our characters, you know,
2833140	2836140	will he abdicate to that throne?
2836140	2841140	Will we audition as I suggested we might other dungeon masters and each week and
2841140	2843140	see how they, how they work for us?
2843140	2844140	So I don't know.
2844140	2846140	I don't plan that far ahead.
2846140	2847140	I'm a bad planner.
2847140	2849140	I stick pens up my ass.
2850140	2853140	That was not a guy who is thinking about Wednesday on Monday.
2855140	2856140	That's a.
2861140	2863140	That is a man who deems his car pace.
2868140	2871140	Please, please welcome to the stage for those of you who are here last week or
2871140	2872140	listen to last week.
2872140	2873140	Sorry.
2873140	2875140	I totally blue balled your applause there.
2876140	2877140	I'm sorry about that.
2878140	2883140	But for those of you here last week or listening to last week, we, you know,
2883140	2886140	I said, I want to play Dungeons and Dragons on the podcast.
2886140	2889140	I think I want to, somebody needs to roll characters for us.
2889140	2891140	We, I needed immediately.
2891140	2894140	I'm so out of touch with the world of Dungeons and Dragons.
2894140	2898140	I haven't, I, the books I own are from 89 and thank you.
2898140	2900140	Applause for a year.
2901140	2902140	It was a pause for a year.
2902140	2904140	Someone applauded a year.
2904140	2909140	Um, so we brought this guy up.
2909140	2912140	He shot his hand up when I said, who knows anything about Dungeons and Dragons?
2912140	2913140	Who's a dungeon master?
2913140	2915140	Spencer raised his hand coming up.
2915140	2918140	And, and so I talked to him after the show.
2918140	2920140	I think we should edit all this out because I'm explaining a bunch of redundant
2920140	2921140	bullshit.
2921140	2925140	But let's, let's, let's bring our character,
2925140	2928140	the guy who's going to create Jeff and I's first level Dungeons and Dragons
2928140	2930140	characters to the stage.
2930140	2931140	It's Spencer.
2931140	2932140	Everybody bring him up.
2934140	2938140	Applause
2940140	2941140	How's it going?
2941140	2942140	Here he is.
2944140	2946140	Now at risk, Jeff, you're like,
2946140	2948140	for those listening, do we want to describe Spencer?
2948140	2951140	He really does scream dungeon master.
2951140	2953140	I would say, uh, what?
2953140	2954140	Six, five, four.
2954140	2955140	How tall are you?
2955140	2956140	Six, four.
2956140	2957140	Six, four.
2957140	2958140	Six, four.
2958140	2963140	Bearded, uh, hair, uh, pretty long, uh,
2963140	2969140	Metallica length hair, um, uh, lower, uh, lower scapula length, uh, hair.
2969140	2972140	Uh, he's a, he'd be spectacled and kind of like, uh, you know,
2972140	2975140	intellectual small, uh, glasses.
2975140	2977140	He's got a t-shirts and plaid shorts.
2977140	2979140	He's very casually dressed.
2979140	2983140	I, you know, I would have pictured a top hat and a cloak, but, uh,
2983140	2985140	I mean, but it's a podcast.
2985140	2987140	There's different kinds of dungeon master.
2987140	2989140	I mean, this is, this is the, we'll edit that part out.
2989140	2992140	He's a, he has a leather top hat and goggles on.
2992140	2993140	The goggles aren't on his face.
2993140	2994140	They're on the hat.
2994140	2998140	And, uh, he's wearing a jacket that goes down to the floor and there's 18
2998140	2999140	buckles on it.
2999140	3004140	Uh, he has pockets, uh, on each arm that each of which are clearly
3004140	3005140	carrying a weapon.
3005140	3008140	And, uh, he has a dice satchel.
3008140	3010140	That's not true.
3010140	3012140	No, we want to, I want people to really know.
3012140	3014140	He's a very casual dungeon master.
3014140	3020140	He looks like, um, a, a, a, it's, um, it's, uh, it's, it's, it's casual
3020140	3027140	Friday at the, uh, Norse pillager village on the, on the, on the Viking ship.
3027140	3028140	Yes.
3028140	3031140	It's, it's biz cash fry during the Norman invasion.
3031140	3033140	It's, it's, it's, it's laundry day.
3033140	3036140	Um, Eric, the reds, uh, boat.
3036140	3037140	Right.
3037140	3039140	Uh, it's a, it's a big bushy beard.
3039140	3040140	So yeah, six foot four.
3040140	3043140	Employee of the month, uh, 1524.
3044140	3045140	Okay.
3045140	3046140	All right.
3046140	3050140	So Spencer, uh, the, the, the, the, all our, our goal right now for this
3050140	3054140	conversation, all we want to do is just, we want to talk about the kinds of
3054140	3055140	characters Jeff and I would like to play.
3055140	3059140	Now there's not a lot of like two person campaigns.
3059140	3060140	Is there a Dungeons and Dragons?
3060140	3061140	That's not really a common thing.
3061140	3064140	I don't think it's too common, but it does end up happening.
3064140	3065140	Yeah.
3066140	3068140	Well, it's, it's, yeah, it's certain.
3068140	3070140	Sometimes you don't have any friends.
3070140	3071140	Yeah, exactly.
3072140	3076140	If, if there's one contingency, we have the role playing ilk, uh, have to
3076140	3080140	prepare ourselves for it's, uh, it's less people showing up than we thought.
3081140	3085140	Can I just say like two pens and a real doll ago, I was like, they're gonna
3085140	3086140	think I'm a loser.
3089140	3090140	You're welcome.
3090140	3091140	You're welcome.
3091140	3092140	You're like Cary Grant up here.
3095140	3099140	Uh, yeah, I am not a, uh, yeah, I am a, I am a nerds nerd.
3100140	3102140	Have you ever tried on stockings and put a pet on your butt, Spencer?
3102140	3104140	Can't say that I have, but I'm interested.
3105140	3106140	What a square.
3110140	3111140	Uh, all right.
3111140	3112140	So yeah, so it happens.
3112140	3118140	I think that, uh, I, I win because I know that in creating a parties of Dungeons
3118140	3121140	and Dragons characters, what you want is a kind of balance.
3121140	3127140	Like it's possible for Jeff and I to both be magic users or, but, and or both
3127140	3131140	be fighters, but we'd probably want to, we probably want to balance ourselves a
3131140	3132140	little.
3132140	3133140	Yeah.
3133140	3137140	You want some like, uh, some heavy meat to take some damage and, uh, some
3140140	3141140	Yeah, you want to balance.
3142140	3143140	Sweet as taboo.
3145140	3146140	I've never played this.
3146140	3148140	I have no idea what either of you two are talking about.
3148140	3149140	All right.
3149140	3150140	Well, let's walk them through it, Spencer.
3150140	3153140	It's like, if I'm assuming that the third edition of Dungeons and Dragons hasn't
3153140	3156140	changed, it hasn't changed to the fundamentals of phrase.
3156140	3159140	It was like, there's class, class is like occupation.
3159140	3160140	There's fighter.
3160140	3161140	Well, you, you list.
3161140	3162140	All right.
3162140	3163140	Yeah.
3163140	3164140	So mostly it's just like classes.
3164140	3167140	There's the barbarian, which is, you know, a barbarian.
3167140	3172140	There's a bard, which tells magical stories and can cast spells and cause people to
3172140	3174140	double over in painful laughter.
3174140	3176140	There's a clerics.
3176140	3179140	They channel their power of their gods.
3179140	3180140	Let's see.
3180140	3183140	Uh, Druids, they're kind of like hippies, but with magic.
3184140	3186140	Um, you got fighters.
3186140	3188140	They have big swords and whatnot.
3188140	3190140	You got, uh, let's see here.
3190140	3191140	All right.
3191140	3194140	You got monks, which are kind of like martial artists, you know, like Jackie Chan
3194140	3195140	kind of people.
3195140	3197140	You got your rain.
3197140	3201140	No, you got your paladins, which, you know, they smite evil in the name of their
3201140	3203140	gods and are usually jerks.
3204140	3206140	There's a Rangers.
3208140	3211140	I think I just hand shot up when he heard that description.
3212140	3215140	You got the Rangers, which is like Lego loss from Lord of the rings.
3215140	3216140	He's got a bow.
3216140	3219140	He uses two swords, you know, that sort of thing.
3219140	3221140	Um, and they're kind of nature experts.
3221140	3222140	Yeah.
3222140	3223140	They got, they can hunt there.
3223140	3227140	They can, uh, have beast pets sort of thing like beast master.
3228140	3229140	Yeah.
3229140	3230140	Like taint master.
3231140	3232140	Almost.
3234140	3237140	Uh, wait, is that, are there thieves and assassins?
3237140	3238140	Yeah.
3238140	3239140	There's thieves, which are rogues.
3239140	3242140	They can be like assassins or just thieves, you know, stealing stuff or
3242140	3244140	sneaking on high ledges.
3244140	3248140	I'm going to go for, um, what's a barbarian do?
3248140	3252140	Barbarians fly into dangerous rages in which they shrug off even the fiercest
3252140	3253140	of damage.
3253140	3254140	I'll take that.
3254140	3255140	I'm a barbarian.
3255140	3256140	All right.
3256140	3257140	Sounds good.
3257140	3259140	So then I feel like, can I wear a suit?
3259140	3261140	Can I be a barbarian in a suit?
3261140	3262140	Yeah. Yeah.
3262140	3265140	No, it could be like ripped, you know, cut off like slacks.
3265140	3266140	Sweet.
3267140	3269140	Barbarian in a suit.
3270140	3271140	Cut off slacks.
3271140	3272140	That's a librarian.
3274140	3279140	Uh, the, uh, I should offset that then with like a spell casting kind of
3279140	3280140	occupation.
3280140	3281140	Yeah.
3281140	3282140	Like a bard or a druid or a wizard.
3282140	3285140	You know, I think I'm just going to go straight up the middle because it looked
3285140	3290140	like you got a, got a barbarian and then I should, I should be a cleric or magic
3290140	3291140	user.
3291140	3292140	Yeah, a cleric or druid.
3292140	3295140	I'm going to say, I'm going to say magic users so that we have some offensive
3295140	3297140	capability between the two of us.
3297140	3298140	Thank you.
3298140	3300140	Give a little bit of applause there from Rob Shropp.
3300140	3303140	Uh, so then there's class.
3303140	3304140	That's the first choice you make.
3304140	3305140	So we've done that.
3305140	3306140	Then there's race.
3306140	3307140	My favorite.
3309140	3311140	The most exciting thing in the world to me.
3313140	3315140	Uh, you're a, you're a Filipino bard.
3317140	3320140	You want to, you want to run down the races?
3320140	3323140	Yeah, you got, um, well, I mean humans, those are us.
3323140	3324140	Um,
3325140	3326140	Oh, he's good.
3329140	3331140	The right man for the job.
3333140	3334140	You got your elves.
3334140	3335140	Most people know what elves are.
3335140	3336140	They live in trees.
3336140	3337140	They're like bows and arrows.
3337140	3340140	But some people think elves are a little shrimpy, shrimpy, shrimpy people.
3340140	3341140	I make cookies.
3341140	3342140	Yeah.
3342140	3344140	Like, like, this isn't a Keebler elf, is there?
3344140	3345140	Well, actually, yeah.
3345140	3346140	Lord of the Rings.
3346140	3348140	Now everybody knows that it's a Orlando bloom.
3348140	3349140	Okay.
3350140	3354140	You got, uh, half elves, which are half human, half elf,
3354140	3356140	loved by all.
3356140	3358140	They're accepted.
3358140	3359140	Okay.
3359140	3360140	That's just true.
3360140	3361140	That's the game.
3365140	3367140	Don't hate the role player.
3375140	3376140	Uh, okay.
3376140	3380140	You got half elf, or no, halflings, which are rarely really short people,
3380140	3381140	kind of like toddlers.
3381140	3382140	If they looked old.
3382140	3384140	I think I'll, I think I'll, I think I'll be human.
3384140	3386140	I'm gonna be a human magic user.
3386140	3387140	Pussy.
3389140	3390140	All right.
3390140	3394140	This, this, uh, dwarf, uh, barbarian is going to beat your ass.
3394140	3396140	Am I a gnome or a dwarf?
3396140	3397140	You're probably a gnome.
3397140	3399140	You could be a dwarf, but that's less hilarious.
3399140	3400140	No.
3400140	3401140	No if it is.
3401140	3402140	Yeah.
3402140	3405140	And the, and the, and the rest of it, you know, unless we have any specific
3405140	3408140	interests that we want to talk about, like I cut concepts that we want to,
3408140	3412140	because part of your job now as a dungeon master, from what I understand is,
3412140	3414140	he's going to go roll our characters.
3414140	3415140	This is a comedy.
3415140	3419140	So, so some of it involves actual die rolling, like, like, you know, like,
3419140	3422140	like generating our attributes, which are strength, intelligence, wisdom,
3422140	3423140	charisma, I'm assuming.
3423140	3424140	Stop me if I'm wrong.
3424140	3425140	No, those are all right.
3425140	3426140	Yeah.
3426140	3427140	Uh, okay.
3427140	3429140	What, but, but I mean, we could, we could turn you loose now and you could,
3429140	3432140	you could, you could, you could roll his first level characters.
3432140	3433140	We're going to be very weak.
3433140	3434140	Uh, and we're going to have a kind of it.
3434140	3436140	And then, and then we'll get, you'll present them to us next week.
3436140	3437140	You go, here's your character.
3437140	3440140	So maybe, maybe we, maybe we should come up with our names.
3440140	3441140	Jeff.
3441140	3444140	I'm going to guess you're going to be mission night blade.
3444140	3446140	No, because I'm going to be a magic user.
3446140	3447140	All right.
3447140	3448140	Yeah.
3448140	3449140	I'll come up with my name.
3449140	3452140	Uh, right now.
3452140	3453140	No.
3453140	3454140	I don't know.
3454140	3455140	What do you think Spencer?
3455140	3456140	Do we come up with them now or do we, do we,
3456140	3458140	do you come back with these characters that are nameless?
3458140	3459140	You should come up with a name now.
3459140	3460140	You know what?
3460140	3461140	How about this?
3461140	3463140	Uh, let's let the audience tonight name our characters.
3463140	3464140	Okay.
3464140	3465140	All right.
3465140	3466140	Uh, I want, uh, let's see.
3466140	3467140	Uh, you right here, sir.
3467140	3469140	Uh, hold your hand in the air and then you miss right there.
3469140	3471140	I want you to put your hand in the air there.
3471140	3472140	Yeah.
3472140	3473140	Yeah.
3473140	3478140	I want, uh, you to give me my first name and I want you to make it, uh, uh, know me like,
3478140	3482140	you know, like something that to think of whatever gnomes name would be and you something
3482140	3483140	barbaric.
3483140	3484140	Okay.
3484140	3486140	And on the count of three, I want you to say what you're thinking right now.
3486140	3489140	So you, sir, give me the gnome first name.
3489140	3491140	You ma'am are the barbaric last name.
3491140	3492140	Ready?
3492140	3493140	One, two, three.
3493140	3494140	Quark.
3494140	3495140	Quark.
3495140	3496140	All right.
3496140	3497140	I am court.
3497140	3498140	Okay.
3498140	3499140	All right.
3499140	3500140	That's fucking backfire.
3500140	3501140	Yeah.
3501140	3512140	I think I'll just call you a quark probably.
3512140	3518140	We'll be on a first name basis for most of it.
3518140	3537140	I come from a long line of magic user, magic user, sharpie, sharpie, sharpie butts a lot.
3537140	3538140	Sharpie butts a lot.
3538140	3539140	Okay.
3539140	3540140	All right.
3540140	3543140	No, no wrong answers.
3543140	3545140	Sharp, sharpie, butts a lot.
3545140	3548140	We're definitely starting off on the right foot.
3548140	3549140	Okay.
3549140	3550140	All right.
3550140	3551140	Well, let's have a hand for Spencer.
3551140	3553140	He's going to go do some hard work for us.
3553140	3554140	Spencer.
3554140	3562140	And thank you, Spencer.
3562140	3564140	Yeah.
3564140	3569140	He's going to go do those characters and then next week he'll come to us with what he's created
3569140	3573140	and then we'll just examine them and that'll be where we probably won't start playing next
3573140	3576140	week because then we'll have time to...
3576140	3578140	I'm not going to produce the show in front of you guys.
3578140	3583140	We'll talk about it later.
3583140	3584140	We should do rapid fire...
3584140	3588140	Let's get these fashion questions out and then let's send these people on their merry
3588140	3589140	way.
3589140	3590140	It's Friday night.
3590140	3591140	We're not going to hear Rob's butt story or no?
3591140	3592140	Well, I don't think...
3592140	3593140	Can we save this time?
3593140	3595140	Rob washed his butt too much and...
3595140	3599140	All right, Sharp, come up.
3599140	3600140	Can you do the...
3600140	3601140	Yeah.
3601140	3602140	You want the short version?
3602140	3603140	Yeah, yeah.
3603140	3604140	What's the short version?
3604140	3605140	Oh, gosh.
3605140	3607140	I don't remember.
3607140	3608140	Remind me.
3608140	3609140	How did this all get started?
3609140	3610140	By the way, it all got...
3610140	3612140	Shittiest seats in the building.
3612140	3613140	I know.
3613140	3614140	I don't know why they put chairs down there.
3614140	3615140	These are reserved.
3615140	3616140	Yeah.
3616140	3617140	It's...
3617140	3618140	Well, also, that's part of...
3618140	3619140	That's my fault.
3619140	3620140	Rob's describing...
3620140	3621140	This is your view the entire time.
3621140	3622140	Yeah.
3622140	3626140	If you sit stage right here at the show, audience left, you look at the back of Dan's head most
3626140	3627140	of the show.
3627140	3628140	What is that?
3628140	3629140	It's my fault.
3629140	3631140	It's also my fault because I tend to talk to Jeff because I'm insecure.
3631140	3632140	That's okay.
3632140	3634140	And so then you're looking at my tight ass.
3634140	3641140	Also, at Everything is Festival, Joel in Cinematic Titanic is going to be on Sunday.
3641140	3642140	Oh, okay.
3642140	3645140	So go to see that because it's super hilarious.
3645140	3650140	It's important to mention that our hero and mentor, Joel Hodgson, from Mystery Science
3650140	3652140	Theater, is here.
3652140	3654140	Yeah.
3655140	3664140	Joel Hodgson, truly a God among nerds and even some regular people.
3664140	3668140	Joel, when Roshab and I moved to L.A., we were strangers in a strange land.
3668140	3669700	We had no idea what we were doing.
3669700	3673700	And this other guy from the Midwest, who we worshiped when we were in Milwaukee because
3673700	3678860	we loved his show, he was out here in L.A. too and he showed...
3678860	3683420	He was a big part of making us comfortable out here, explaining to us how disgusting
3683420	3686420	we could be out here and preparing us for that.
3686420	3688420	And he's a good stand-up guy.
3688420	3689420	He's a great guy.
3689420	3691420	I miss him like the dickens.
3691420	3693420	Missing dickens.
3693420	3694420	Anyways.
3694420	3699420	You made the whole taint thing sound like we were some serious Chuck and Buck shit.
3699420	3702420	Hey man, you know what you got to do?
3702420	3706420	You got to rub that taint when you're chirking.
3706420	3709420	It's not like that at all.
3709420	3710420	We were...
3710420	3712420	I would be Chuck, right?
3712420	3713420	Right?
3713420	3715420	That's important to you.
3715420	3717420	That's really petty.
3717420	3718420	That's really petty, Rob.
3718420	3720420	He's thinner, right?
3720420	3721420	But what...
3721420	3724420	I mean, there's several chapter, decades.
3724420	3725420	Well, okay.
3725420	3727420	Just stop me when you want to take over.
3727420	3728420	Okay.
3728420	3733420	Rob, at some point in his life, became obsessive about cleaning his anus.
3733420	3735420	That was...
3735420	3736420	That was an un-charismatic...
3736420	3738420	Is that a really bad thing?
3738420	3739420	No, no.
3739420	3740420	Of course not.
3740420	3744420	What's bad is how late in life I became obsessed.
3744420	3746420	You decided that you weren't...
3746420	3747420	Yeah.
3747420	3750420	I don't think my mom potty trained me properly.
3750420	3752420	Because I remember...
3752420	3754420	I remember like...
3754420	3755420	I don't know what it was.
3755420	3761420	I don't know if my mom said it, but I got it in my head that all you had to do is wipe
3761420	3763420	three times.
3763420	3764420	It's just ridiculous.
3764420	3767420	On the ceiling if you want me.
3767420	3770420	And if you wipe three times...
3770420	3773420	I was never taught to look at the tissue.
3773420	3774420	I was a kid.
3774420	3776420	It was like, wipe three times.
3776420	3778420	On the ceiling if you want me.
3778420	3780420	And then flush.
3780420	3786420	And the toilet paper magically makes the poop go away.
3786420	3791420	Which is not true if you've ever tried to get a peanut butter off the carpeting.
3791420	3797420	Don't take three wipes.
3797420	3800420	What goes on in Wisconsin, by the way?
3800420	3802420	It's crazy over there.
3802420	3805420	But that's the setup.
3805420	3808420	What you started doing is you started really kind of...
3808420	3809420	Going for it.
3809420	3811420	Really washing it.
3811420	3813420	Making up for 20 years.
3813420	3815420	Because I...
3815420	3816420	God.
3816420	3819420	I can't tell why...
3819420	3820420	Yes, I can.
3820420	3823420	Okay, so as a joke...
3823420	3824420	Oh, man.
3824420	3826420	I'm so sorry, honey.
3826420	3827420	I'm so sorry.
3827420	3829420	She's married to you now.
3829420	3830420	She can't do anything.
3830420	3832420	I want to stay married.
3832420	3836420	She's not going to divorce you for telling how you clean your butt.
3836420	3842420	Anyway, as a joke, back in the Dead Ale Wives Day, when we would chill our balls
3842420	3844420	and our dicks and stuff like that.
3844420	3845420	It was the funniest thing in the world.
3845420	3847420	We thought we invented that.
3848420	3854420	I dropped my pants, and I grabbed a towel, and I wiped it,
3854420	3859420	and it was shockingly dirt-soiled.
3859420	3861420	And I thought...
3861420	3865420	Everybody goes, nobody's more embarrassed than I am.
3865420	3869420	And then our good friend, Sean McKenna, looked at me.
3869420	3874420	Who would pull his dick out and pee on your shoe as a joke and stuff?
3874420	3877420	Yeah, Sean had a bit he would do called the Star Wars trilogy,
3877420	3881420	where he would do three things with his penis.
3881420	3884420	He would make it a lightsaber with a pen light,
3884420	3889420	and he would pretend it was Jabba the Hutt by making his ballsack talk.
3889420	3895420	And then for an empire, he would tuck it into its own foreskin.
3895420	3896420	Carbonite.
3896420	3903420	And then pretend it was the big reptile creature trying to swallow the Millennium Falcon.
3903420	3906420	His pinky was the Millennium Falcon as it flew away,
3906420	3909420	and he would let his package unpackage.
3909420	3914420	The point being, Sean McKenna's not someone that you want.
3914420	3915420	From who?
3915420	3917420	In derision, you don't take it lightly.
3917420	3922420	That pre-pult fiction comedy just was so easy back then.
3924420	3929420	He had an impression of Jimmy Durante that could...
3929420	3932420	Yeah, it involved a pair of glasses and his dick.
3932420	3934420	His closer was Jimmy sneezing.
3934420	3938420	Yeah, sometimes Jimmy had a cold. Let's move on.
3938420	3942420	So anyway, the guy who would do that...
3942420	3943420	Fucking Milwaukee.
3943420	3951420	As a joke, I wipe my ass, and Sean goes,
3951420	3955420	Jesus Christ!
3956420	3959420	Do you ever wipe your ass?
3959420	3962420	And it was like...
3962420	3968420	It didn't make sense to me until that moment, so my...
3968420	3971420	Somebody hit rewind on the VCR in my head,
3971420	3975420	and I rewound from 24 to 4 going,
3975420	3982420	Oh my God, I am the most disgusting person in the world.
3982420	3985420	And things started making sense.
3985420	3990420	The dots were connected, and I was like, Oh my God.
3990420	3993420	I don't have a girlfriend.
3993420	3996420	After that, I went for it.
3996420	4000420	I was washing, it was scrubbing.
4000420	4003420	And that escalated.
4003420	4006420	You could get special shower heads.
4006420	4009420	Kate, when we first moved in,
4009420	4013420	Kate was the best girlfriend in the world,
4013420	4015420	and now is the most amazing wife in the world.
4015420	4017420	Please applaud.
4017420	4021420	Kate Froyne.
4021420	4026420	Kate Froyne, married to the tank master.
4026420	4031420	She buys me, I think it was like a birthday present
4031420	4035420	or a Christmas present, like a shower snake.
4035420	4038420	You know where you attach it, so you could do it,
4038420	4041420	just so I could really wash my ass.
4041420	4043420	Because you wanted to, because she wanted you to.
4043420	4044420	No, no, no.
4044420	4046420	She knew that would make you happy.
4046420	4050420	And because, I don't know, I got it in my head that
4050420	4053420	the hotter the water, the cleaner it would be.
4053420	4055420	Makes sense.
4055420	4057420	It works for dishes.
4057420	4061420	Right, yeah.
4061420	4063420	That's what I did, that's what I was thinking.
4064420	4069420	So I remember there was a point where I was like,
4069420	4072420	I have my leg up, I have a leg up, I know.
4072420	4074420	You dressed like a woman.
4074420	4076420	You put on fishnets.
4076420	4079420	I look good.
4079420	4083420	I remember I'm in the shower, my leg hiked up,
4083420	4092420	spraying, and the other hand is slowly turning up the heat.
4092420	4098420	So I'm going, and going, ah, ah.
4098420	4100420	Like, trying to.
4100420	4102420	One pill makes you happy.
4102420	4109420	Yeah, just really trying, because I was trying to boil away
4109420	4117420	20 years worth of disgusting, terrible hygiene.
4118420	4127420	And I remember one time I went really too far.
4127420	4130420	And I think I got an instant message.
4130420	4131420	I got an I-chat.
4131420	4135420	That was the night before New Year's.
4135420	4138420	Because we went to Vegas with Davis,
4138420	4144420	and Akiva Shaffer was there, and Drew Carey was there.
4144420	4148420	And I was like, well, it's.
4148420	4149420	Were you there, Kate?
4149420	4150420	Were we dating it?
4150420	4151420	OK, all right.
4151420	4153420	Well, it's New Year's Eve.
4153420	4158420	Time to better put on the top patent tails here.
4158420	4161420	Let's just really clean it up.
4161420	4165420	And I remember, did we drive?
4165420	4167420	We drove there, right?
4167420	4168420	I don't know.
4168420	4175420	Somewhere between the shower and the stroke of midnight,
4175420	4180420	things just were not right with the tank master.
4180420	4183420	I was, oh, gee.
4183420	4188420	And it was like I scalded my entire, like,
4188420	4190420	I just was like for a month.
4190420	4192420	I was just like torn up.
4192420	4193420	So you went to this doctor.
4193420	4195420	That's the story of the night.
4195420	4196420	OK.
4197420	4199420	That's the crawl lock?
4199420	4201420	Yeah, that's the crawl lock.
4201420	4204420	That's the crawl before we go to Tatooine.
4209420	4214420	It's a dark J for the rebellion.
4214420	4216420	Or hot.
4216420	4217420	Or hot.
4217420	4218420	It could be hot.
4218420	4219420	It could be hot.
4219420	4220420	Oh, they don't even know.
4220420	4221420	This is probably hot.
4221420	4225420	Your asshole needed to go to hot to cool down.
4226420	4228420	So I didn't have a doctor at the time.
4228420	4232420	And Kate helps me find this, find this,
4232420	4236420	it was the worst, I had this terrible Armenian doctor
4236420	4237420	that I went in there.
4237420	4239420	Which isn't, that's not, he wasn't terrible
4239420	4240420	because he was Armenian.
4240420	4242420	It was terrible and Armenian.
4242420	4245420	That's not like Irish medicine.
4245420	4249420	It just, and I went in there and I didn't sit down.
4249420	4254420	And he's like, oh, what's wrong with you?
4255420	4258420	He studied in Italy.
4258420	4261420	He went to school in Bologna, I think.
4261420	4264420	Was his name Boyardian?
4264420	4265420	Oh, what's up?
4265420	4267420	I had a chef's hat and apparently it meant Boyardian.
4267420	4269420	Oh, what's so wrong with you?
4269420	4270420	What's so wrong?
4270420	4275420	Dr. Boyardian, you're needed in the meatball warden.
4277420	4281420	So we talk for a really long time.
4281420	4284420	He says, so what's the problem?
4284420	4287420	And I'm like, well, I think there's-
4287420	4290420	He might not have been Armenian by the way.
4290420	4293420	I think I can't do an Armenian accent,
4293420	4295420	so I just do Italian.
4295420	4298420	Was he jumping over barrels?
4298420	4302420	His secretary was a giant gorilla.
4305420	4308420	Who had plus signs for teeth.
4308420	4317420	And so we talk about approvals.
4317420	4321420	Well, I think I've got something going on down there
4321420	4324420	and I'm worried about it.
4324420	4330420	I'm trying to find out if there's a way that we can do something about it
4330420	4334420	without me showing my butt.
4334420	4335420	Not going to happen.
4335420	4338420	So he's like, well, why don't you take off your clothes
4338420	4340420	and get up on the table.
4340420	4343420	So I'm like, Jesus.
4343420	4345420	That's a spicy butt hole.
4348420	4350420	Mamma mia.
4350420	4352420	Marron.
4354420	4360420	So I get on the table and I'm naked.
4360420	4367420	I'm naked and I'm on all fours.
4367420	4373420	And we have a conversation with my nuts.
4373420	4376420	He's like, look in the air.
4376420	4380420	And he goes, all right, let's see what the problem is.
4380420	4387420	And he goes, oh my, what did you do?
4388420	4391420	Mamma mia.
4391420	4396420	And I try to act like, what?
4396420	4397420	What's going on?
4397420	4399420	What do you got going on down there?
4399420	4406420	And he's like, it's all colored, discolored and everything.
4406420	4408420	And I'm like, what?
4408420	4409420	Like blue?
4409420	4410420	What's going on?
4410420	4413420	And he's like, oh.
4413420	4417420	OK, well, and he prescribes all this junk
4417420	4420420	that I'm supposed to put on there.
4420420	4421420	All right, well.
4421420	4422420	Yeah.
4422420	4424420	So go to Found Crab.
4424420	4425420	Yes, go to Found Crab.
4425420	4426420	August 26.
4426420	4428420	The Tate Master, everybody.
4428420	4429420	The Tate Master.
4429420	4432420	Cinematic Titanic with Joel Hodson this Sunday.
4432420	4437420	That's Monster House writer Rob Strav taking the stage.
4437420	4439420	All right, we're going to end the show with a speed round.
4439420	4440420	Yeah, we got to jump.
4440420	4442420	I feel bad because people write these questions
4443420	4445420	and they're like, there's a lot of good ones here.
4445420	4446420	Our audience is the best.
4446420	4447420	You guys asked the best.
4447420	4448420	You're really good at this.
4448420	4450420	We have you write stuff down on pieces of paper.
4450420	4454420	And you're always so cooperative and so sincere and like really
4454420	4455420	cool about it.
4455420	4457420	I want to reward you for that, not punish that.
4457420	4458420	I'm sorry.
4458420	4462420	It's, you know, we ran uncharacteristically long.
4462420	4465420	But I do want to tend to them.
4465420	4466420	All right, here we go.
4466420	4469420	Ladies and gentlemen, the theme tonight was fashion and style.
4469420	4470420	This is the speed round.
4470420	4472420	Dan, I want you to keep your answers as terse
4472420	4473420	and as succinct as possible.
4473420	4476420	Should we get a number of words for my answers?
4476420	4477420	You pick.
4477420	4480420	OK, let's do three word answers.
4480420	4481420	Three word answers.
4481420	4483420	I saw Zach hold up three fingers because he's like,
4483420	4487420	I got a pork chop with my name on it at home.
4487420	4489420	Zach, our technician, says three words.
4489420	4490420	Here we go.
4490420	4491420	Starting off, speed round.
4491420	4497420	Dan, is it all right to wear a white fedora after Labor Day?
4497420	4502420	Yes, siree Bob.
4502420	4507420	Is it ever OK to wear a pattern tie with an argyle vest?
4507420	4508420	Yes, siree Bob.
4508420	4510420	All right.
4510420	4512420	OK, this one's a little more abstract.
4512420	4515420	Ted Nugent or Gary Busey?
4515420	4517420	From a fashion standpoint.
4517420	4519420	Obviously Gary Busey.
4519420	4520420	All right.
4520420	4523420	What do you think of people who wear glasses to look nerdy
4523420	4526420	or cute when they don't even need them because they have
4526420	4530420	a fucking 2020?
4530420	4539420	Meow, glasses lady.
4539420	4546420	Have you ever considered beard braiding?
4546420	4548420	Just yesterday.
4548420	4550420	Yes.
4550420	4551420	I'm sorry.
4551420	4558420	Why do hipsters dress like Steve Urkel?
4558420	4561420	The alternative's worse.
4561420	4562420	Nice.
4562420	4563420	No, apparently not.
4563420	4568420	At what point does a t-shirt need to be thrown out?
4569420	4577420	More stains.
4585420	4589420	Happening.
4589420	4594420	That one was brought to you by Nike, Tonto.
4594420	4597420	Where do you buy your clothes?
4597420	4600420	My girlfriend's purchase.
4600420	4605420	What should one wear to a bar mitzvah?
4605420	4611420	Probably a yarmulke.
4611420	4612420	All right, now here's a tough one, Dan.
4612420	4613420	Here's a tough one.
4613420	4618420	What shoes go with a narrow cut tapered black suit?
4618420	4622420	Adidas, Adidas, Adidas.
4622420	4623420	Thank you, everybody.
4623420	4624420	This has been Harmon Town.

4636420	4640420	Try not to judge me too much for what I've said tonight.
