0	15440	Hello one and all, welcome once again to Meltdown Comics, theater, and nerd melty towns.
15440	21600	From Hollywood, California, Harmon Town is now in session.
21600	30640	Won't you please keep those applause going and welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmon
30640	33880	Town, Dan Harmon.
33880	49040	Thank you, thanks for coming out, why so many people, why, it's like a record crowd I think,
49040	53120	I don't know if we've ever, maybe it's just because there's lighting back there or something.
53120	54120	It's a big crowd.
54120	55120	Yeah.
55120	57100	All right, let's give them what they're worth.
57100	63560	Let's make sure they walk out of here going, I spent $10 and got $20 worth.
63560	66320	How do we make sure that happens?
66320	67760	We just fuck them.
67760	71960	All right, line up on the right.
72960	79960	All right, so a couple things, I just want to, I mean, we had our charity event here
79960	86360	today, we had the 826LA charity event.
86360	90760	And as far as I understand it, it's a good charity.
90760	92000	I'm told.
92000	98680	I'm assuming I'm not going to find out that it's like a charity that goes to fund windowless
98680	104280	white vans.
104280	107600	From what I hear, it sounds like exactly my kind of charity.
107600	113000	Because I've always said, I mean, yes, there's hungry people, yes, there's poor people, yes,
113000	117000	there's people with horrible diseases battling them all the time.
117000	124480	There's a million, billion, trillion, zillion ways to try in vain to spread your money if
124480	128880	you have a penny to spare around the planet to try to make the planet a better place,
128880	130960	to try to break the cycle of agony.
130960	138480	However, in my tiny little bubble of existence, I have always been asked this question, why
138480	144440	are your writing staffs always a bunch of white dudes from Harvard?
144440	149400	And the answer is always because that's the big pile of scripts that piles up.
149400	154520	And the answer to that, why is that big pile of scripts from white dudes from Harvard?
154520	157080	The answer is because those people have support systems.
157080	164640	Those people are willing and able to spend 15 years pursuing the agonizing field of writing
164640	168560	while their parents support them and things because their parents told them it's possible
168560	170720	for you to be a writer, et cetera, et cetera.
170720	175600	It all trickles back to this idea that when you're in sixth grade, did anyone ever come
175600	180560	to you, did anyone ever come to your public school and tell you, you could be a writer,
180560	185600	you can do something creative, you are allowed while you're thinking of being a princess,
185600	190120	while you're thinking of being an astronaut, have you ever considered the possibility that
190120	193600	writer is an occupation and that that doesn't happen?
193600	200080	Now I don't think that if you tell sixth graders the world over that they should be writers
200080	204600	that they're going to then wander into a world where they're totally supported.
204600	207680	But I do think that not enough of them are being told that.
207680	213200	There's not enough creative activation in the grade school era of your uprising.
213200	216880	As far as I understand about 826, that's what they're doing.
216880	223360	They're like injecting themselves into that part of the genome and trying to change something
223360	224360	there.
224360	231160	Saying to 11-year-old kids, write something, create something, they break the cycle there.
231160	236640	So we raised tons of money today for them and hopefully that'll go to something good.
236640	240480	But look them up, Google it, and actually, you know what, I shouldn't have babbled about
240480	244240	it because we have people here from it and I wanted to ask them personally if I'm right
244240	245240	about that.
245240	252000	They're going to come up and say, no, that's not true, we've been working on biofuel.
252000	253000	You got it all wrong.
253000	255720	Did you have a teacher, Dan?
255720	261000	The first teacher or somebody that supported your writing as a kid or your brain as a child?
261000	267500	You know, I did because I grew up in the 70s in Milwaukee and every time I expressed
267500	273200	an interest in reading and writing, there was somebody, whether it was my mom or some
273200	279320	well-meaning teacher, there was somebody that said, holy fuck, they always responded that
279320	280320	way.
280320	284000	I don't know why you guys are laughing at that.
284000	290040	I'm saying that is a thing that doesn't happen for everybody and it may very well be as far
290040	297880	as I know, that may be why I ended up being halfway decent at what I do.
297880	300160	It may be just hypnosis.
300160	304280	But there's a story you might have told before I'm in town about you being like, you were
304280	307160	separated and went into that little room.
307160	308160	Yeah.
308160	309160	Yeah.
309160	313880	In the 70s, it was still okay to like grab kids that showed an interest in stuff and
313880	319760	you yanked them out of general pop and you threw them into a closet and you said, okay,
319760	320760	how smart are you?
320760	321760	Show us.
321760	324160	And they still did that with me back then.
324160	329920	And I was like a weirdo and they cranked me up and then they threw me back in during
329920	334400	when Reagan got elected and then I was like, ah, stop, why are you hitting me?
334400	337840	Yeah, it was, it was, I mean, it was, yeah, it was tracking.
337840	345800	I mean, there's a sinister side to it and a humanitarian side to it.
345800	352080	And I think that the bottom line is like kids, you can't farm them.
352080	353720	You cannot farm education.
353720	355480	It doesn't work.
355480	362400	You have to like, like every single tiny little human brain is a, the whole thing that's for
362400	366360	sale with the human species is diversity.
366360	372840	It's the idea that every little cranium contains not another kernel of popcorn, but in fact,
372840	378640	a potential Picasso and it doesn't, that doesn't make it shameful.
378640	385200	If the thing that pops is a delightful garbage man that that's not shameful.
385200	388280	What's shameful is treating them all the same.
388280	390440	That's what's shameful.
390440	397780	You have to regard every pre Picasso brain as if it might be a Picasso.
397780	399400	So Dan, are you pro life?
399400	400400	No, maybe.
400960	404800	That's that then it gets more complicated.
404800	409040	Once the sperm hits the egg, fuck that thing, flush it down the toilet.
409040	413480	But for God's sakes, once it's got a head, I don't know.
413480	422160	Anyways, I rolled into this stuff early because we, we, so why don't we, let's, let's, let's
422160	424240	just bring up Tyler.
424240	425240	Where's Tyler?
425240	426240	Is he in the front row?
426240	427240	There you are.
427240	428240	Are you willing to come up?
428240	429240	Are you cool?
429240	430240	Coming up.
430240	438120	Tyler, grab a, grab a mic and have a scene.
438120	443720	Did I get, what did I get wrong when I, Tyler is one of the, you were there at the beginning
443720	446440	of eight to six, what became eight to six LA.
446440	447440	You were there in San Francisco.
447440	448440	Yes.
448440	449440	Yeah.
449440	453480	I was, I feel so old now thinking about this because I haven't had to think about it.
453480	454480	Yeah.
454480	458240	Eight to six years ago, right around now, I was the first, one of the first students
458240	459240	at eight 26 Valencia.
459240	460240	Oh, there was a clap.
460240	461240	That was adorable.
461240	465960	I don't know why I should get a clap, but, so you're one of the first students.
465960	470960	Does that mean you were one of the first beneficiaries of eight to six's existence?
470960	471960	Yeah.
471960	472960	Yes.
472960	473960	Okay.
473960	474960	Yeah.
474960	475960	So you weren't one of the founding members of this charity.
475960	479080	You were one of the first kids that benefited from this.
479080	480080	Yeah.
480080	481080	Yeah.
481080	482760	And it was started by Dave Eggers out of San Francisco.
482760	483760	He's the author.
484520	485520	Yeah.
485520	489880	He's a Pulitzer prize, a finalist for a heartbreaking work, a staggering genius.
489880	494880	He wrote the script for where the wild things are, the movie, done work with spike Jones,
494880	495960	many things like that.
495960	501560	But the guy that wrote the book where the wild things are, he started a much better
501560	502560	charity.
502560	513160	It's more pure, it's more beloved, it's called nine three seven.
513160	517600	Not that we can measure these things, but yes, it's called nine three seven earth.
517600	519880	That's a higher number.
519880	520880	Yeah.
520880	521880	Earth.
521880	528880	But yeah, I guess the biggest thing for anyone to take away, and I do know, because I was
528880	533000	introduced by Harman Town just by finding it online, that there's so many people around
533000	536760	the world listening to this right now when they do listen to it in the future, that eight
536760	541880	twenty six is not just L.I., it is not just San Francisco, it is eight cities in the U.S.,
541880	544680	they are always looking for volunteers.
544680	549240	Just for a twenty twelve, twenty thirteen year, they served thirty four thousand students,
549240	553520	they had over four thousand volunteers nationwide, but they are always looking for more.
553520	556720	So it's not just your money, but they would always love your money, and if you ever want
556720	562840	to spend that, each store across the nation has their own niche market that they like
562840	563880	to sell things to.
563880	569640	So here, if you happen to be a time traveler, their storefront is for time travelers.
569640	575640	San Francisco is a pirate supply store, I believe Chicago is a robot supply store.
575640	577600	New York is for superheroes.
577600	581320	And I mean, at the root of it is tutoring, right?
581320	582320	Yes.
582320	584200	It is creative writing and tutoring.
584200	587920	It's a thinking man's boy's center.
587920	591800	When I was a kid, it was like, keep the kids off the street, you know, try to keep them
591800	592800	in a gang.
592800	595640	There was like, what were those things called, the YMCA's?
596640	598640	Well, is YMCA or the...
598640	600640	Boys Club.
600640	601640	Boys Clubs, yeah.
601640	606640	I was in a boys club as a kid, and I don't know under what circumstances, but I do know.
606640	608640	Desire.
608640	612640	I was the Connect 4 champion.
612640	613640	That's awesome.
613640	615640	That's how low budget that boys club was.
615640	617640	Don't sell yourself short.
617640	620640	I'm sure if it was global, you would still be...
620640	622640	I'm sure you're really good at Connect 4.
623640	624640	We didn't play rugby.
624640	625640	We played Connect 4.
625640	627640	No, but I bet you're really good at Connect 4.
627640	630640	Oh, there's two things I'm great at.
631640	632640	Connect 3?
632640	633640	Connect 4?
636640	639640	I will challenge anybody to Connect 4 or Boggle.
639640	640640	I will beat you.
640640	641640	I will beat you at Boggle.
643640	644640	I believe you.
646640	647640	Have you...
647640	648640	I mean...
650640	653640	No, also, that said, Dan, I will tell you right now.
653640	655640	Here's a couple things I'm bad at.
655640	658640	I'm terrible at foosball and ping pong.
658640	659640	I can see that.
659640	664640	Just based on tonight, you're terrible at bragging.
673640	676640	Oh, I haven't begun to brag yet.
676640	678640	No, I know you can do better than that.
678640	679640	Tyler...
679640	680640	Is it just me or Tyler?
680640	681640	Little Jason Sudeikis.
681640	682640	Do you see this?
685640	687640	I don't know if that's a compliment.
687640	688640	Oh, it is.
688640	689640	Oh, yeah.
689640	690640	Yeah, sure.
690640	691640	He's dating Olivia Wilde.
691640	692640	All right.
692640	695640	So you were a little fella and you...
695640	698640	How did you encounter 826?
698640	700640	Like, you were where?
700640	705640	I was in the East Bay and I read Dave's book.
705640	710640	And it did quite a lot for me in terms of his honesty.
710640	714640	And what I found so amazing about today is that two of my favorite things came together
714640	717640	in that I think you and Dave actually shared the same.
717640	719640	It was the mentality of pure honesty.
719640	720640	But I'm better than him.
720640	721640	Yes.
721640	722640	I'm assuming.
722640	723640	Of course.
723640	724640	Okay, all right.
724640	725640	It's not important.
725640	726640	No, no, no.
726640	727640	I mean, there were scales...
727640	728640	You're assuming.
728640	729640	Yeah.
729640	732640	And, yeah, I just signed for a class online.
732640	735640	I took a summer course with him for, I think, 12 weeks.
735640	737640	And, yeah, it was an amazing experience.
737640	738640	Stayed in contact.
738640	741640	And it's helped me for the last decade.
741640	746640	So since the last decade, I mean, thousands of students have been helped reading, writing,
746640	747640	tutoring.
747640	750640	Some famous celebrities help out kids that they don't need to.
750640	752640	You know, they're not paid to do so.
752640	754640	Spike Jones helps out a lot.
754640	757640	Nina Vay and many people in the writing circles.
757640	759640	If you go in there and tutor a kid...
759640	763640	My biggest dream is to do something that I felt like I could...
763640	768640	You know, I want to feel good about myself.
768640	773640	And yet I don't want to talk to people.
773640	775640	I don't want to go near people.
775640	781640	I don't want to help a kid.
781640	783640	Not really.
783640	785640	I got in a physical sense.
785640	788640	The kid's like, I need help.
788640	791640	Checkbook.
791640	793640	I want to.
793640	794640	I want to.
794640	797640	You want to not help a kid.
797640	798640	I don't want to.
798640	806640	What I don't want to do is help a kid that would be me at 11, 12.
806640	811640	The kid that would be me would be like, fuck you, old piece of shit.
812640	817640	I want to go play on my Commodore 64 at home.
817640	819640	And I'm sure that's not still a problem.
819640	820640	No.
820640	821640	I'm sure they've grown beyond that.
821640	825640	We've solved the Commodore 64 problem.
825640	826640	Thank God.
826640	830640	Is there an archetypal kid that you would want to help?
830640	832640	If you could imagine the kind of kid that you would...
832640	833640	It's the kid. It's me.
833640	835640	But it's the same kid that would be hard to help.
835640	839640	This dirty face little piece of shit that you trust anybody.
839640	841640	Not alone, anybody that was telling him what to do.
841640	846640	I grew up hating adults, not wanting anybody to tell me what to do.
846640	848640	I needed somebody to...
848640	853640	I valued very much my parents when telling me,
853640	857640	my mom was unconditionally supportive of me creatively.
857640	860640	If I did anything, my mom was like,
860640	862640	holy shit, that's amazing that you're doing that.
862640	866640	I don't think that's something a lot of people have.
866640	870640	But at school, if somebody told me what to do,
870640	875640	fuck you, karate chop, every mental karate chop ever.
875640	880640	Since you were a beneficiary of this,
880640	882640	have you become a benefactor of it,
882640	885640	aside from the fact that you came to the sale today
885640	888640	and spent untold millions?
888640	893640	Oh yes, it wasn't noted, but you're welcome for all the cake.
893640	897640	Have you become active in the...
897640	900640	Sadly, I moved away from the country for a couple years,
900640	902640	and even now I don't live nearby.
902640	903640	You went to Russia, didn't you?
903640	907640	Because you got taught to be a communist by this horrible socialist organization.
907640	909640	I went from first world to second world,
909640	911640	and now I'm in third world, technically.
911640	912640	So that's what happens.
912640	915640	But no, no, even from what you were noting,
915640	919640	if you don't necessarily want to be in front of a child and tell them what to do,
920640	923640	I can understand it, it's a very odd situation.
923640	925640	Frightening people, children.
927640	930640	The thing that actually inspired me the most is that on the walls,
930640	932640	at least in 826 in San Francisco,
932640	938640	writers would donate their first, second, and third versions of scripts or books,
938640	942640	and you would see famous names like Coppola on a script,
942640	945640	and he would just axe out huge portions of it.
945640	947640	And I was supposed to instill in kids this idea
947640	951640	that even some of these luminaries do not get it right.
951640	952640	You are always working.
952640	953640	It doesn't matter what your name is.
953640	955640	And I never met any of these people.
955640	957640	You could just walk up and see someone's name that you knew,
957640	960640	and you realize that it's not always right the first time.
960640	962640	Yeah, yeah, I would love to.
962640	963640	God damn it.
963640	967640	As long as I don't have to touch them or lump them in the eye.
967640	970640	Why are you afraid of children, Dan?
970640	971640	I can't do it.
971640	973640	Kids don't like me.
973640	975640	Some kids like me.
975640	976640	Do you know that?
976640	979640	It's really touch and go with me.
979640	989640	Like Dino's kid, when she was a little larva, like toddler,
989640	995640	I would go like, Mr. Flappy Arms, Mr. Flappy Arms,
995640	997640	and she'd be like, ah!
997640	1000640	She loved it.
1000640	1002640	And now she's like 15 or something,
1002640	1005640	and she's got the cell phone and she's just rolling her eyes,
1005640	1008640	and I can't even be the same.
1008640	1011640	You're afraid of 13-year-old Dino's daughter right now?
1011640	1014640	As kids who are really actually cognitively active.
1014640	1020640	But why is a kid more or less frightening than an adult?
1020640	1023640	Because they're able to judge me.
1023640	1025640	Well, adults are too, right?
1025640	1027640	Well, yeah.
1027640	1030640	Adults are co-opted by me financially.
1030640	1032640	I own all of them.
1033640	1035640	Most kids don't have a filter.
1035640	1036640	Right.
1036640	1038640	So you're afraid of children because you don't own them yet?
1038640	1040640	Correct, yes.
1040640	1041640	Yes.
1041640	1044640	Like, Willy Wonka works for me.
1044640	1046640	The girl that turns into a blueberry,
1046640	1047640	she's still got something over me
1047640	1050640	because she doesn't understand finance yet.
1050640	1054640	I'm figuring this out at the same time as you are.
1054640	1055640	I guess that's what it is.
1055640	1058640	I think we're going to agree that we haven't figured that we're not yet.
1059640	1061640	I skipped a step.
1061640	1066640	I skipped being good at football and went right to owning things.
1066640	1069640	But we've talked about the fact that you're not good with like,
1069640	1072640	you're not comfortable around strangers or other people for that matter.
1072640	1076640	But are children more frightening than adult?
1076640	1078640	Teenaged children, yeah.
1078640	1080640	I don't think there's anybody in this room that's like,
1080640	1081640	I love teenagers.
1081640	1083640	Give me some.
1083640	1086640	Except in the most horrible sense.
1087640	1090640	That guy, that guy.
1090640	1095640	But, I mean, teenagers are, for good reason,
1095640	1103640	we send them to war and we worship them and we are looking to them
1103640	1105640	and they don't know anything.
1105640	1107640	They're like this monolith of energy.
1107640	1108640	Everything comes off of them.
1108640	1110640	And they don't know what the fuck they're doing.
1110640	1114640	And almost capitalism almost like really fucks them over in that sense.
1114640	1117640	You know, the Baby Boomers celebrate that day
1117640	1120640	when the fucking Beatles played on Ed Sullivan or whatever.
1120640	1122640	That's their big day.
1122640	1123640	Bigger than the moon landing.
1123640	1126640	Like, you see more footage of the fucking Beatles playing on Ed Sullivan
1126640	1128640	than you see of some Yahoo landing on the moon.
1128640	1132640	Fucking moon is a fucking thing, a rock far away.
1132640	1138640	How many times, like Robert Zemeckis thinks that the Beatles playing on Ed Sullivan is a bigger deal.
1138640	1142640	The...
1142640	1146640	Forrest Gump, if you read the book,
1146640	1149640	it has a whole chapter where he goes to the moon, by the way.
1149640	1150640	What?
1150640	1152640	They took it out of the movie.
1152640	1153640	No.
1153640	1154640	No.
1154640	1157640	Because it doesn't, it's not interesting to Baby Boomers.
1157640	1158640	There's no book.
1158640	1160640	They will mention in casting that they land it on the moon.
1160640	1161640	There's no book.
1161640	1163640	Forrest Gump is a fucking book, are you kidding me?
1163640	1164640	There's a book?
1164640	1167640	Somebody tell this asshole, Forrest Gump is a book.
1167640	1170640	Forrest Gump is a book, motherfucker.
1170640	1173640	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
1173640	1176640	Yes, Forrest Gump is a book, and in the book...
1176640	1177640	He goes to the moon?
1177640	1178640	Yes.
1178640	1179640	Forrest Gump...
1179640	1180640	He doesn't go to the moon.
1180640	1186640	In the Forrest Gump book, Forrest Gump is legitimately like Down Syndrome, like...
1186640	1187640	No.
1187640	1188640	No.
1188640	1190640	What do you mean, no?
1190640	1192640	Three people said no.
1193640	1198640	Okay, Forrest Gump is pretty much labeled as legitimately like, it's pretty clear that
1198640	1201640	he is like, really low 90s IQ.
1201640	1202640	Like, he's...
1202640	1203640	He's like...
1203640	1204640	He's an American.
1204640	1207640	Sub-balooshi like this.
1209640	1212640	I don't know what the politically correct term is.
1214640	1216640	Sub-balooshi.
1216640	1219640	The book takes you through all of the interesting shit.
1219640	1221640	He throws his medal, the congressional medal, and the thing.
1221640	1227640	In the book, for instance, he takes his purple heart and he throws it on the steps of the
1227640	1231640	Capitol building, and he hits a senator in the head.
1231640	1233640	And that senator's name?
1235640	1236640	Forrest Gump.
1236640	1237640	I don't know...
1237640	1238640	No, there's no...
1238640	1242640	I'm saying in the book, it's more inflammatory, it's more passionate.
1242640	1245640	It's like Cormac McCarthy, like version of Forrest Gump.
1245640	1246640	Did you read this book?
1246640	1247640	Yes, I did.
1247640	1248640	I thought you didn't read books.
1248640	1250640	I know, but sometimes I just grab one and just...
1250640	1253640	The one book you read was Forrest Gump?
1254640	1256640	I'll page through him.
1256640	1258640	I don't qualify it as reading.
1258640	1260640	I just think, okay.
1261640	1262640	I read Forrest Gump.
1262640	1264640	He goes to the space in the book.
1264640	1266640	I don't want to spend the whole podcast.
1266640	1268640	I swear to God.
1269640	1270640	Google it.
1270640	1271640	He goes to space.
1271640	1272640	Here's my point.
1272640	1278640	The baby boomers who took over this planet and were bulging it with garbage and corn syrup
1279640	1285640	and fucking these narcissistic maniacs, these people who have destroyed everything
1285640	1289640	and were telling us that we should be honored to follow in their footsteps,
1289640	1291640	they landed on the moon.
1291640	1292640	They always tell us that.
1292640	1296640	But what they're really, really proud of is a fucking Ed Sullivan show.
1296640	1298640	He slaps you, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1300640	1303640	Garbage, garbage, garbage, garbage, garbage.
1303640	1305640	I can't remember why we were on this topic.
1306640	1307640	You hate teenagers.
1307640	1309640	Yeah, we were trying to help the kids.
1309640	1310640	Teenagers, okay.
1312640	1316640	The idea that teenagers are an entity,
1316640	1321640	the idea that teenagers, in spite of not being old enough to go to war,
1321640	1325640	not being old enough to drink, not being old enough to drive a car,
1325640	1328640	are somehow this center of capitalism.
1328640	1334640	That is a baby boomer invention because they were that age when they became sentient.
1335640	1338640	And we are living in the shadow of that fucking gross willow tree.
1339640	1342640	And that results in all of us going on YouTube,
1342640	1348640	48-year-old people telling Miley Cyrus that she's a slut in the comment section,
1348640	1350640	like, what, let her be a slut?
1350640	1352640	What the fuck did she do wrong?
1352640	1354640	She's a fucking teenager.
1354640	1358640	Let her be a teenager, either, and fucking Justin Bieber,
1358640	1360640	I'm on his side, I'm still on his side.
1361640	1363640	No, no.
1363640	1364640	I'm still pro-Beiber.
1364640	1366640	No, why are you pro-Beiber?
1366640	1368640	He's a little douchebag.
1368640	1371640	No, he doesn't have a right to be a douchebag or not.
1371640	1374640	He's a fucking child, and it's capitalism.
1374640	1376640	Capitalism that you hate.
1376640	1378640	It's not Justin Bieber, it's capitalism.
1378640	1381640	I've seen him on camera, he's that fucking little asshole.
1381640	1382640	Capitalism!
1382640	1383640	No.
1383640	1386640	He would just be some kid at your fucking Thanksgiving.
1386640	1387640	Not true.
1387640	1388640	Or for capitalism.
1388640	1389640	Not true.
1389640	1392640	Now he just shouldn't give people that much money.
1393640	1394640	He didn't earn it.
1395640	1396640	He's a musketeer.
1398640	1399640	Just cut him off.
1399640	1401640	Just tell him you danced enough.
1401640	1402640	You did it.
1402640	1403640	You're great.
1403640	1404640	Give him a go-kart.
1404640	1405640	Tap it.
1405640	1407640	Put a fucking tap on it.
1409640	1410640	He gets his go-kart.
1410640	1412640	He wouldn't have known.
1412640	1415640	Everything you see him doing, he's saying to America,
1415640	1418640	why did I get more than a go-kart?
1418640	1419640	Why?
1420640	1423640	Why is my go-kart $800,000?
1423640	1425640	Why does it go so fast?
1425640	1427640	Why can it kill people?
1427640	1430640	Why are my pop rocks cocaine?
1431640	1433640	It's your fault.
1434640	1436640	You don't have a culture.
1436640	1438640	You don't have a fucking religion.
1438640	1439640	You are garbage.
1439640	1441640	You are capitalism.
1441640	1444640	You have a fucking bedrock of money.
1444640	1447640	And it says, in God we trust and the God is spelled with dollar signs
1447640	1449640	even though there's no S in it.
1451640	1455640	None of you get to blame him for anything.
1456640	1459640	Just sit on the fucking internet jerking off with one hand
1459640	1462640	and making fun of Justin Bieber with the other.
1462640	1464640	You're not doing anything.
1464640	1466640	He's a child.
1466640	1470640	What would you do with a billion dollars?
1470640	1471640	What would you do?
1471640	1472640	He's 19 though.
1472640	1474640	He's gorgeous.
1475640	1477640	And he's a genius.
1480640	1482640	I think you buried the lead on that one.
1483640	1486640	Give a billion dollars to anybody in this room, including me.
1486640	1488640	See how we handle it.
1488640	1491640	This fucking poor Canadian schmuck.
1493640	1496640	The egregious behavior that we engage in.
1496640	1500640	48-year-old housewives with eight cats on their shoulders
1500640	1503640	sitting on their laptop with fucking stains on their sofa.
1504640	1507640	Yeah, I need, I need, I need Justin Bieber's needs
1507640	1510640	to be able to understand his value system.
1510640	1513640	The fuck are you talking about, you fucking idiots?
1513640	1516640	The fuck do you think your taxes go to?
1518640	1521640	Fucking focus your rage on something productive.
1522640	1524640	Follow the money you retard.
1524640	1526640	The shit, sorry.
1531640	1533640	Edit it out, edit it out.
1533640	1535640	Leave it, it stays.
1535640	1537640	No, no, no.
1537640	1542640	It's interesting that Justin Bieber is the tipping point for your rage.
1542640	1544640	It is, it is.
1544640	1548640	Because I see him, they put him on TMZ and he's in that deposition.
1548640	1550640	Yeah, but when he talks to you, he's like,
1550640	1553640	Look what I'm doing, look what I'm doing, yeah.
1553640	1555640	And they're like editing around him.
1555640	1560640	There's a dude that's like 53 years old sitting in an avid deck
1560640	1563640	and setting in points and out points
1563640	1568640	on a fucking Canadian teenager's deposition
1568640	1574640	so that he can make $80 from TMZ giving them clips of this kid.
1574640	1577640	Are we fucking out of our mind?
1577640	1581640	If you were a caveman, how would you react to that?
1581640	1584640	How would you react to a tribe if you came over the hill
1584640	1587640	and found them engaged in that behavior?
1587640	1589640	You would eat them.
1589640	1591640	You would take their water.
1591640	1593640	You would take everything they had.
1593640	1595640	And you would never look back.
1595640	1597640	You'd take their cave.
1597640	1599640	You'd take their animals.
1599640	1601640	You'd take everything.
1601640	1603640	And you would never look back, ever.
1603640	1606640	You would erase their cave art.
1606640	1608640	And you wouldn't feel bad.
1608640	1611640	You'd be like, they didn't mean it.
1611640	1613640	They did it wrong.
1613640	1615640	They fucked up.
1615640	1616640	They're idiots.
1616640	1618640	They're a strain of our DNA that fucked up.
1618640	1622640	They care too much about this kid.
1622640	1624640	You've got to fucking respect your elders
1624640	1629640	and love your children and further the species.
1629640	1630640	We fucked up.
1630640	1631640	We're dead.
1631640	1636640	Anyways, so eight to six LA.
1636640	1643640	It's for, I mean, eight to six.
1643640	1644640	It's for the kids.
1644640	1645640	It is for the kids.
1645640	1647640	And it's going to teach them how to write.
1648640	1652640	So Dan, you're saying you wouldn't want to mentor a teenager?
1652640	1653640	I would.
1653640	1655640	But the first thing I would do is sit them down and say,
1655640	1658640	look, according to NASA, we have 40 years left.
1658640	1659640	I just read this on the internet.
1659640	1661640	According to NASA, what?
1661640	1662640	We've got 40 years left.
1662640	1663640	40 years left of what?
1663640	1664640	On this planet.
1664640	1668640	Now I will say this, conflict of interest with NASA.
1668640	1671640	NASA released a report that said,
1671640	1674640	can't live on this planet for more than 40 years.
1674640	1675640	Based on population?
1675640	1679640	This is a company that profits if we leave the planet.
1679640	1681640	So I won't say that.
1681640	1684640	However, we did give them nothing to do
1684640	1686640	other than think about their shit.
1686640	1689640	Malthusian, like population?
1689640	1692640	It's a confluence of everything.
1692640	1697640	It's ozone and it's tidal waves and pickles are getting bigger.
1697640	1700640	So I would say bees are turning into potatoes.
1700640	1701640	I don't know.
1701640	1704640	I would say you and I at age 40 and you're 41.
1704640	1705640	No, we nailed it.
1705640	1708640	No, we're going to ride that wave right into the beach.
1708640	1709640	That's what I'm saying.
1709640	1712640	When I heard that, I came over to the Rick and Marty room
1712640	1713640	and they're like, do you hear it?
1713640	1715640	NASA said we've got 40 years left.
1715640	1722640	And I was like, I'm the bad guy in a ski movie.
1722640	1723640	I nailed it.
1723640	1726640	In my dreams, I'll make it to that.
1726640	1727640	My kid will be 10.
1727640	1730640	I'll be like, so long, Toby.
1730640	1731640	You're done good.
1731640	1733640	Your kid's name is Toby?
1733640	1735640	Because you're a big Roots fan.
1735640	1738640	It's better than Aaron's riffs.
1738640	1742640	Saffron and fucking Cormac.
1742640	1743640	Cormac?
1743640	1744640	Yeah.
1744640	1745640	For real?
1745640	1746640	It's the new Hunter.
1746640	1748640	Oh, dear.
1748640	1750640	We'll bring her out soon.
1750640	1754640	Tyler, would you shut the fuck up for three seconds?
1754640	1758640	I've just been rambling and going on and on and on.
1758640	1762640	Tyler, what does a 28-year-old Harman Town fan that's listening
1762640	1769640	in, let's say, Seattle, because there's this LA tag on 826LA,
1769640	1771640	we're doing things locally.
1771640	1777640	What do they do?
1777640	1778640	I'll tell you.
1778640	1782640	Yeah, so anyone can go to 826national.org.
1782640	1785640	That is 826national.org.
1785640	1788640	And that website will tell you everything you can do for any city
1788640	1790640	in the US that has an 826.
1790640	1791640	And they can volunteer their time.
1791640	1795640	They can tutor kids ages 6 to 18.
1795640	1797640	They can help with field trips.
1797640	1801640	They can literally sit down and read a book with someone.
1801640	1803640	It's all the things you don't want to do.
1803640	1808640	Yeah, but an objective says, yeah, one of the coolest things is they bring
1808640	1812640	kids into these field trips, into these local centers,
1812640	1819640	and the kids get to write a book, and they leave that day with a bound book
1819640	1822640	that they wrote, which is...
1822640	1823640	Dan, I think...
1823640	1826640	I don't think you can dismiss the power of that to a kid.
1826640	1827640	I think you should do it.
1827640	1830640	And I'm not like being challenging you.
1830640	1831640	I'm saying, go face your fears.
1831640	1833640	Pick an age from 6 to 18, you say?
1833640	1834640	No, I will do it.
1834640	1835640	I'm going to do it.
1835640	1836640	I'm going to do it.
1836640	1843640	Because I would say, I don't care which age group you pick
1843640	1847640	or what kid you get, I would say that it will be...
1847640	1849640	It will impact you in a good way, I guarantee it.
1849640	1851640	I'll do whatever I can.
1851640	1853640	I mean, I've been aching for...
1853640	1856640	I need to be, like, yeah.
1856640	1857640	I don't know.
1857640	1861640	Like, yes, I have that part of my soul that's been decaying.
1861640	1865640	It's obviously where a limb is supposed to be growing and reaching out.
1865640	1869640	And I hope you get a 17-year-old girl who...
1869640	1872640	Wow, okay.
1872640	1876640	Who, on sight, doesn't like the cut of your jib.
1876640	1877640	Oh, okay.
1877640	1878640	All right.
1878640	1881640	That's a good six years on ABC this fall.
1881640	1884640	That sounds amazing.
1884640	1888640	All right, well, let's thank Tyler for coming up and representing 826.
1888640	1890640	Thank you, Sharon.
1897640	1900640	He's a beneficiary of that organization, and he came today,
1900640	1904640	and he bought a lot of shit to benefit that charity,
1904640	1905640	which may put people off.
1905640	1909640	They're like, well, what are you, like, some kind of insect hive?
1909640	1912640	Do you just train people to...
1912640	1913640	Are you, like, a Scientologist?
1913640	1916640	Oh, yeah, so you're a beneficiary of the charity,
1916640	1918640	and you put money back into the charity for evidence.
1918640	1922640	He was one of the original kids, and he got all kinds of cool swag today.
1922640	1924640	How much money did you raise today?
1924640	1925640	Can you say?
1925640	1926640	Is that bad?
1926640	1927640	Well, lots and lots.
1927640	1928640	I don't know.
1928640	1932640	There was donations that came in just because we raised awareness of the charity.
1932640	1934640	We had a nice garage sale today.
1934640	1939640	We were, like, you know, 50 cents for my Tootsie DVD.
1939640	1940640	And there was also...
1940640	1943640	I was walking around with a sign around my neck that Aaron put around me
1943640	1946640	that said $50 to do a shot with Dan Harmon,
1946640	1953640	and some of these people took me up on that, I think.
1953640	1955640	We raised quite a bit.
1955640	1960640	It was a good day for them and us and America and God
1960640	1964640	and hostess Twinkies.
1964640	1969640	So, okay.
1969640	1978640	So while I was at this event today, this garage sale,
1978640	1980640	I don't usually pay attention to this stuff.
1980640	1983640	But I walked around the room, and I saw a thing on the table,
1983640	1989640	and I was like, oh, that's funny that Aaron's got a book about Sinbad's advice on comedy.
1989640	1997640	She had a book that was, like, the comedy Bible advice from.
1997640	2006640	It's a Jerry Seinfeld, Paul Reiser, George Carlin, George Wallace.
2006640	2009640	I just, like, rattle off...
2009640	2011640	What's that?
2011640	2013640	Unfortunately, it's called Comedy Insights.
2013640	2015640	Comedy Insights.
2015640	2018640	On the cover, it's just, like, this two-column list of people.
2018640	2024640	And I swear to God, every single person on that list is, you can let it go.
2024640	2028640	And then just, like, right in the middle of it, it just says, Sinbad.
2028640	2033640	And I was like, that's kind of funny, because it kind of makes Sinbad feel like a contest winner,
2033640	2035640	like, after all this time.
2035640	2040640	I took an Instagram picture of it, and I was like, I was going to make this tweet,
2040640	2044640	where I'm like, I don't know if my tweet was going to be, like, eh, fuck Sinbad.
2044640	2047640	You know, let's just sum it up like that.
2047640	2048640	And I went and sat over there.
2048640	2049640	There was a chair there.
2049640	2050640	It was one of my chairs.
2050640	2052640	I hadn't been sold yet.
2052640	2060640	And I sat there in the chair, and I started to engineer this Instagram slash tweet.
2060640	2062640	And I was about to fire off.
2062640	2068640	And this wave came over me that we all call deja vu,
2068640	2071640	which I wanted to talk about a little bit,
2072640	2074640	because I suddenly had this incredible sense.
2074640	2077640	Sometimes you get deja vu where you're kind of standing in a kitchen,
2077640	2079640	and you're like, I get to swear I had this conversation before.
2079640	2080640	I had a huge one today.
2080640	2083640	I had a deja vu that went on for, like, three minutes the same life.
2083640	2085640	Like, I get deja vu a lot.
2085640	2090640	I was filled with, like, you get little ones where you're like,
2090640	2096640	eh, I feel like I've been in this kitchen talking to this hipster about the fact
2096640	2098640	of the government's bullshit.
2098640	2100640	Like, how do you know that that didn't happen already?
2100640	2102640	I mean, you've been high for two weeks.
2102640	2104640	Like, it probably did happen.
2104640	2109640	I was sitting in this chair in this weird, like, everything was so,
2109640	2111640	such a freaky thing.
2111640	2118640	The concept of deja vu, I'm not a spiritually, I'm a spiritual person.
2118640	2122640	I believe in, like, some kind of relationship with the unknown.
2122640	2124640	I choose to personify the unknown.
2124640	2128640	I choose to have a relationship with the things I don't understand.
2128640	2131640	Otherwise, I'm going to go into a McDonald's with a machine gun.
2131640	2137640	But that's something I choose, and it doesn't, that has nothing to do with evidence.
2137640	2138640	I'm not Fox Mulder.
2138640	2141640	I choose precisely opposite reasons.
2141640	2146640	We will use this particular episode of this podcast as evidence when you do kill people.
2146640	2147640	Go ahead.
2147640	2148640	I'll be dead.
2148640	2154640	I mean, guaranteed, when I kill all of you, I'm going to do it in a way that takes me out, too.
2155640	2158640	Thank you.
2158640	2162640	I have more respect than my predecessors.
2162640	2164640	Weird thing to cheer for, but all right.
2164640	2165640	No, they know.
2165640	2169640	I want to be killed by a guy who has the balls to kill himself.
2169640	2172640	I respect that.
2172640	2175640	Too soon?
2175640	2176640	Too close?
2176640	2179640	Too far?
2179640	2183640	Too possible?
2183640	2184640	Too something?
2184640	2185640	Too plausible.
2185640	2186640	Fine.
2186640	2192640	Speaking of too everything, Anatoly is wearing a Christmas wreath on his head.
2192640	2194640	There's a young lady behind you.
2194640	2195640	I guess she can see me.
2195640	2196640	I don't know.
2196640	2201640	Like I said earlier, he's dressed as Puck from Midsummer Night's Dream for some reason.
2201640	2206640	He's dressed as Puck from Midsummer Night's Dream in Dead Poet Society.
2206640	2208640	The kid who killed himself.
2208640	2209640	Oh, Neil!
2209640	2210640	Oh, Neil!
2210640	2212640	My boy!
2212640	2215640	Can you fly, Bobby?
2215640	2220640	Kurt Woodsmith, shout outs.
2220640	2223640	All right, anyways.
2223640	2224640	What was I talking about?
2224640	2226640	You're talking about, I don't know.
2226640	2227640	I'm not killing everybody.
2227640	2228640	Deja vu.
2228640	2230640	Deja vu.
2230640	2234640	I wasn't going to drink, but I'm going to crack open this Raphael's for Nebra.
2234640	2237640	I could have sworn to God to...
2237640	2241640	This is just like...
2241640	2243640	I was filled...
2243640	2249640	I was filled with the sensation that if I had clicked send or tweaked or whatever the
2249640	2254640	button says, okay, you gotcha.
2254640	2255640	You gotcha!
2255640	2258640	GoPro, whatever it says.
2258640	2260640	Teddy bear, I don't know what...
2260640	2263640	Are you going to Samsung?
2263640	2266640	Did you say Samsung?
2266640	2267640	You gotcha Samsung, right?
2267640	2268640	You gotcha Samsung.
2268640	2269640	That's what the button says.
2269640	2273640	You gotcha!
2273640	2276640	I was absolutely convinced that if I did it, I was going to die.
2276640	2280640	And I didn't do it.
2280640	2281640	I was...
2281640	2282640	There's no, no.
2282640	2283640	You don't have to clap.
2283640	2286640	Because you're having deja vu?
2286640	2288640	Because the deja vu was that convincing.
2288640	2294640	I was actually that convinced that I was living in some weird nexus of time and space.
2295640	2298640	And then part of my memory of sitting...
2298640	2302640	When I was sitting there and I was looking this way and I was looking at an image of
2302640	2307640	a bunch of weird shit on a table that was a weird grad sale thing and I was looking
2307640	2312640	at a tweet that I was about to click send on and I had this sudden sense, I had this
2312640	2322640	memory of a dream that I had when I was a kid of that image, which I didn't understand
2322640	2325640	at the time because obviously there was no...
2325640	2327640	This space didn't exist.
2327640	2336640	So I was remembering a memory that I remembered having when I was younger of this same space
2336640	2343640	but I also remembered not understanding what any of it meant but I also remembered that
2343640	2350640	I was about to click send on something on this device in my hand, which in my memory
2351640	2354640	didn't make any sense because it didn't exist in my childhood.
2354640	2358640	But that when I clicked send I was going to die.
2358640	2362640	So I didn't click send.
2362640	2368640	So the question is, is Sinbad's publicist God?
2368640	2373640	Which would explain his presence on the cover of that book.
2373640	2376640	I think Sinbad is a universal context winner.
2376640	2382640	I used to have deja vu twice a day every day for a long time and deja vu went on for a long long time
2382640	2386640	and so I had to look into it and I've heard it explained that it's an iron deficiency.
2386640	2390640	So I need to eat more iron?
2390640	2392640	Like more spinach and shit.
2392640	2393640	Spinach?
2393640	2397640	Although spinach, the reason why I pop I eat spinach, the reason why people think spinach
2397640	2401640	is iron like heavy, it was a typo.
2401640	2405640	It was supposed to be Spanish.
2405640	2412640	There was some early, I don't know what year it was, but there was something like early days of the FDA
2412640	2419640	but before that they typed up how much iron spinach had in it and there was a typo of a decimal point
2419640	2425640	and it made it seem like spinach had zillions of percentage points of iron.
2425640	2428640	It doesn't have more iron than most green vegetables.
2428640	2434640	It was just a typo and a thing but that got lots of press and that's why Popeye had to eat lots of spinach.
2434640	2437640	But back to my point.
2437640	2442640	It was explained to me that deja vu is because I have so many of them, when I have them,
2442640	2445640	I've been here and I can predict the future.
2445640	2448640	Like the guy is going to walk in. Oh shit there's the guy.
2448640	2452640	You're seeing a guy walk in but your synapses are firing twice.
2452640	2454640	It's like a hiccup.
2454640	2456640	So it feels like your brain is falling.
2456640	2458640	But here's the fucking...
2458640	2462640	When the synapse fires the second time, it's sensing it for the first time
2462640	2467640	and the first time it happens, it's been stored as subconscious memory which doesn't have a date stamp on it.
2467640	2470640	That's the crate, that's it. That's what happened.
2470640	2473640	It felt like I was like eight years old and I dreamt it.
2473640	2478640	And you're going into a drawer in your subconscious mind that has no date stamp.
2478640	2485640	It's just this weird like grab bag of stuff that it feels like a dream, a childhood memory.
2485640	2489640	It happened a split second before or a nanosecond before.
2489640	2495640	So your entire life is like your mom's rubber stamp collection.
2495640	2499640	Tell me more about this.
2499640	2503640	My mom collects rubber stamps. She's got a snowflake for Christmas.
2503640	2505640	She can bring it out every Christmas.
2505640	2507640	But if she chooses to, she can bring it out for Mother's Day.
2507640	2509640	She doesn't give a fuck.
2509640	2512640	It's whatever you dip into ink and it's just like fucking stamps.
2512640	2515640	Your brain has stamps and it just goes...
2515640	2518640	You used a royal wee on that one.
2518640	2522640	Okay, my mom's crazy and has a rubber stamp collection.
2522640	2527640	I'm saying your brain is fucking...it's origami. It can fold in on itself.
2527640	2532640	Our perception of reality is based on, oh, this happened and then this happened.
2532640	2538640	But we in those fleeting moments, we can feel like something happened an indeterminate time ago.
2538640	2541640	And if you killed somebody...
2541640	2543640	Here we go again.
2543640	2547640	If you killed somebody and then someone came up behind you and hit you in the head with a shovel,
2548640	2554640	and then you woke up in a hospital bed and no one...somehow the person you killed tumbled down a ditch
2554640	2560640	and they fell into a tar pit and they sank and they didn't have family and no one cared.
2561640	2563640	Let's just say.
2563640	2568640	And they were a babysitter that you got on Craigslist and you looked into it.
2568640	2571640	No one knew she was at your house that night.
2571640	2574640	And you were in the lower bay area and it's filled with tar.
2574640	2577640	No, I'm doing a bit on the side.
2577640	2579640	Are you planning a murder?
2579640	2584640	Say, theoretically, you hit someone in the head with a shovel, they tumble down a pit, into a tar pit,
2584640	2585640	they sink down.
2585640	2590640	You at the same time, like, your friend comes up behind you and goes like,
2590640	2592640	What are you doing?
2595640	2597640	You're missing the party.
2597640	2603640	And they've got such a static charge on their feet that if they touch your shoulder, you get amnesia.
2605640	2609640	This is a theoretical construct for the purposes of an existential...
2609640	2613640	Do you understand, if a tree falls in the forest and no one's there to hear it?
2613640	2615640	I'm saying one of these things.
2615640	2617640	What the fuck is going on?
2617640	2620640	This is all in Forest Gump, the fuck crap.
2621640	2626640	So you wake up in a hospital, you don't remember this person who fell into a tar pit.
2626640	2627640	No one else does.
2627640	2628640	That you killed.
2628640	2630640	You never remember that you did it.
2630640	2631640	Why?
2631640	2632640	Because the guy...
2632640	2633640	Why does your brain stop working?
2633640	2636640	Because of the static amnesia.
2639640	2645640	Do I really have to be such a fucking sci-fi wizard that I have to construct a device, a helmet that comes over your head?
2645640	2653640	I'm saying if you don't remember, and while you're not remembering, that person stops existing so you don't remember yourself.
2653640	2661640	So you wake up in a world where you killed this person, but you don't remember that you did it and no one ever knows that you did it.
2661640	2665640	So you're just walking around, you're at the water cooler, like, hey, Gladys.
2666640	2669640	Whoa, how about those packers? Don't go there.
2669640	2671640	And you're like getting mad too?
2671640	2679640	You would be getting mad about like someone would go, hey, did you hear Steve cheated on the billiards pool or whatever the fucking office?
2679640	2681640	I don't know what these office people talk about.
2681640	2683640	You'd be like, he did what?
2683640	2685640	Well, that's not fucking cool.
2685640	2686640	He shouldn't do that.
2686640	2688640	Like, you'd be mad.
2688640	2690640	I'm mad. I have no idea what's going on.
2692640	2694640	It's just this is the human condition.
2694640	2697640	If you don't remember, where's this guy going? He's going to take that bad of shit.
2697640	2700640	All right, that's fine. I don't mean to shame you. I'm not trying to shame you.
2700640	2703640	I met this woman down here named Alice Flattery.
2703640	2706640	She's a famous crazy doctor from Harvard.
2706640	2709640	From a made up name world.
2709640	2711640	Alice Flattery?
2711640	2714640	Alice Flattery. You can look her up and she's...
2714640	2716640	Okay, let's all look her up.
2716640	2718640	Alice Flattery.
2718640	2722640	I think she's the chief chair of neurology there and she teaches at Harvard.
2722640	2725640	She's the head of neurology at Boston General, I think.
2725640	2729640	And I met her and she's like a tiny little gal and she walks the tip of her toes
2729640	2733640	and she's hyper-graphic and she writes down everything she thinks about.
2733640	2739640	I read about her and I met her and I said something about like I was telling some story
2739640	2743640	and she wrote it down on her arm and I said, will you pull up your sleeve?
2743640	2745640	And she was like, really?
2745640	2748640	She pulled her sleeve up and she had writing all up her arm
2748640	2751640	and she's hyper-graphic and she has crayons,
2751640	2754640	like a certain kind of crayon that she can write in the shower.
2754640	2759640	Her shower in her place is nothing but writing and her ceilings in her house,
2759640	2763640	a bunch of bulletin boards hung like next to each other
2763640	2766640	so she can put like post-it notes on it to create more surface area.
2766640	2770640	She's hyper-graphic and she is a walking CAT scan
2770640	2773640	and she can walk into a room full of people
2773640	2776640	and she can see something going on with people
2776640	2779640	and she was like, wait, did you ever go scuba diving?
2779640	2781640	Well, yeah. Okay.
2781640	2783640	You have temperature reversal.
2783640	2785640	You touch a certain kind of coral
2785640	2788640	and she just reads people's minds and stuff like that.
2788640	2792640	And I was telling a story about how I fainted once
2792640	2795640	and she goes, wait, she overheard me.
2795640	2797640	I wasn't telling it to her. I was telling somebody else.
2797640	2799640	She goes, you fainted once?
2799640	2800640	How old were you?
2800640	2803640	I go 22 or 23.
2803640	2806640	She goes, had you just peed?
2813640	2816640	And I said, yeah, I had just peed.
2816640	2817640	She goes, oh, thank God.
2817640	2819640	And walked away. I said, thank God.
2824640	2826640	She just left you with that.
2826640	2828640	You've been emailing her ever since.
2828640	2831640	What did you mean?
2831640	2833640	I did a pilot for a TV show that never aired
2833640	2836640	for I think a TBS or something and it was about her,
2836640	2839640	about another crazy doctor but she's for real
2839640	2842640	and she's like wonderfully brilliant.
2842640	2845640	There was an actor in a scene where I was playing a neurologist
2845640	2848640	and an actor was brought in on a gurney
2848640	2851640	and he had a brain stem herniation.
2851640	2854640	He had a farmer, this is based on a real thing,
2854640	2858640	had touched a electrified fence and had a pacemaker
2858640	2861640	and it gave him a brain stem herniation, whatever that is.
2861640	2865640	And so she was there with a bunch of other cast crew,
2865640	2867640	lighting people, doctors.
2867640	2868640	They all got it?
2868640	2869640	No.
2869640	2870640	Oh, sorry.
2870640	2873640	We're all in a hospital room, in a working hospital
2873640	2876640	where they shoot like Grey's Anatomy which is next to a real hospital
2876640	2880640	and she was talking to this actor who's a really good like,
2880640	2884640	maybe like late 50s, early 60s actor laying on a gurney
2884640	2887640	and she goes, okay, what would happen in this,
2887640	2890640	you'd be on your back and your back would be arched
2890640	2894640	and your toes would be pointed and like arched and pointed together
2894640	2897640	and your teeth would be gritted and you'd be screaming gibberish.
2897640	2900640	And so she goes, try that.
2900640	2902640	And so the actor goes, and he does it.
2902640	2904640	And she goes, oh, God, I want to cut your brain up.
2904640	2907640	I don't want to, I just want to.
2907640	2909640	Because she explained to me later on, she's like,
2909640	2912640	neurologists are, we're not like therapists.
2912640	2913640	We werewolves.
2913640	2914640	We're zombies.
2914640	2915640	We're zombies.
2915640	2916640	We want brains.
2916640	2919640	Your brain is a crossword puzzle and we just want to figure it out.
2919640	2921640	She's like, your brain is so fascinating.
2921640	2923640	She's like, Jeff, when you talk and you do this with your hands,
2923640	2926640	she goes, she would say, when you wake up in the morning,
2926640	2928640	do you do this, this, this, this, this?
2928640	2929640	I go, yeah.
2929640	2930640	She goes, yeah.
2930640	2932640	Because the way you, like everything you do with your hands,
2932640	2933640	she can explain your whole life to you.
2933640	2934640	It's really weird.
2934640	2936640	So this actor's on his back and he's doing it perfectly.
2936640	2940640	She goes, then there's a point when you go into a certain kind of like
2940640	2943640	severe, like seizure.
2943640	2947640	And what would happen is your back would go all the way up off the gurney
2947640	2950640	and your eyes would go straight down to where we couldn't even see your irises.
2950640	2952640	It would just be white with your eyes looking straight down.
2952640	2954640	So look down as far as you can.
2954640	2957640	So the guy is doing, I'm standing right next to him because I'm in the scene.
2957640	2960640	His eyes go straight down, but they're only like, like half,
2960640	2962640	like you can still see half of his iris.
2962640	2964640	And she goes, no, no, look all the way down.
2964640	2965640	Yeah, I can't even do it.
2966640	2968640	I'm trying to do it.
2968640	2969640	I can't do it.
2969640	2972640	And she goes, and so there's this, I'll slide out.
2972640	2975640	She said, you know, she's like four foot 11, you know, like, she's like,
2975640	2977640	you can't look any further down than that.
2977640	2980640	And the actor's like, I'm looking down as far as I can.
2980640	2983640	She goes, and just like 25 people in the room.
2983640	2985640	And she goes, you have seven weeks.
2987640	2989640	Even weirder, even way weirder.
2989640	2991640	She looks at him and I'm sitting right next to her
2991640	2993640	and looking down at this actor on the gurney and she goes,
2993640	2995640	you can't look any farther down than that.
2995640	2997640	And she goes, and he goes, I'm looking as far down as I can.
2997640	3000640	And she goes, hmm.
3000640	3005640	When you were like really little, maybe like four or five or six years old,
3005640	3008640	somebody fell and you were looking down at it,
3008640	3010640	but you don't want to look down anymore.
3010640	3011640	What would you remember that?
3011640	3013640	And the guy goes, I have no idea what you're talking about.
3018640	3020640	So this was a CW show.
3021640	3023640	This was for real.
3023640	3025640	It was for real.
3025640	3031640	And also, some of the people in the room are actual medical consultants
3031640	3035640	that are there to make sure that you're doing it right in a hospital setting.
3035640	3037640	And everybody goes fucking silent.
3037640	3039640	And she goes, now look down.
3039640	3041640	And his eyes go all the way down.
3041640	3044640	And then she goes, I want to talk to you later about that.
3044640	3048640	And everybody, all the hair on the back of my neck stood out.
3049640	3050640	And I talked to her later.
3050640	3054640	And she goes, the brain is this thing that if you touch it,
3054640	3055640	it feels like toothpaste.
3055640	3058640	It's this weird mass of goop in our heads.
3058640	3060640	And we'll never understand it.
3060640	3064640	But she can walk into the room and go like, you went scuba diving once.
3066640	3068640	And we made a bad pilot.
3070640	3074640	She wasn't able to like, your eyes are looking at the TV.
3074640	3076640	What are you seeing?
3076640	3078640	American Idol.
3079640	3081640	They're able to look away.
3081640	3082640	What are you watching?
3082640	3084640	Weird crap with no explanation.
3084640	3086640	I have to say, the coder to this is amazing.
3086640	3087640	It's like, yeah, we did this thing.
3087640	3090640	And she's like, you guys are like, you actors, you guys are so funny.
3090640	3092640	It's like, you're the worst neurologist in the world.
3092640	3094640	You are not doing it right.
3094640	3095640	I said, why?
3095640	3097640	She said, because neurologists, we're bad with people.
3097640	3100640	We only want to solve the puzzle of the human brain.
3100640	3102640	We are not good with human interaction.
3102640	3105640	But you guys, you come into a scene and you touch the other actor,
3105640	3106640	who's going through this thing.
3106640	3108640	You walk in and you put your hand on the shoulder.
3108640	3109640	You smile.
3109640	3113640	And she's like, we know that you can reverse engineer happiness by smiling.
3113640	3116640	You can actually tell people, like, raise your cheeks up
3116640	3118640	and it actually creates joy.
3118640	3121640	Like, you can reverse engineer happiness through faking smiles.
3121640	3123640	She's like, we know that, but we're bad at it.
3123640	3128640	So she wrote an article about how actors taught her to be a better neurologist.
3128640	3131640	And so there's a picture of me in the Harvard Medical Journal.
3132640	3133640	All right.
3137640	3140640	Let's bring out my betrothed Darren McGathey.
3150640	3151640	Hello.
3151640	3155640	I wanted to bring you out because I feel like you helped out a little bit
3155640	3157640	in today's charity.
3158640	3160640	Dan, you did most of the lifting today.
3160640	3161640	Yeah.
3161640	3166640	I mean, I definitely, I was the reason why everything happened today.
3166640	3167640	No, I'm kidding.
3167640	3173640	Erin is absolutely the, I wish I could show everybody a slideshow
3173640	3178640	of all the times Erin tried to make me lift a finger for any of this.
3178640	3182640	And I reminded her of the deal we had from the get go, which was,
3182640	3184640	you do whatever you want.
3184640	3186640	I will show up on Sunday.
3187640	3191640	But if at any point you asked me to do anything,
3191640	3195640	I am going to yell at you and be mean to you.
3195640	3199640	And I held to that because I'm a hero.
3201640	3204640	No, you sell yourself short.
3204640	3205640	You were great.
3205640	3206640	You did a lot.
3206640	3209640	May I share my favorite theory about deja vu,
3209640	3213640	which I think is one of the more popular theories about why deja vu happens
3213640	3217640	is because your brain is simply mistaking the present for the past,
3217640	3220640	meaning that there's something that goes wrong in your brain.
3220640	3223640	And often people experience deja vu before seizures.
3230640	3232640	Did you just put the goocher on me?
3233640	3234640	Thank you.
3234640	3238640	We all just watched Jeff with spoons in our pockets.
3239640	3241640	I'm joking.
3241640	3244640	Because people used to put spoons in people's mouths of seizures.
3244640	3247640	Anyway, the idea that your brain,
3247640	3249640	it's just like a neurological misfire.
3249640	3251640	The idea that your brain can actually be like,
3251640	3253640	no, this happened before.
3253640	3257640	But it's the idea that we have a condition in our brain that says...
3257640	3259640	Yeah, I think as Jeff was describing,
3259640	3262640	it's sort of like the engine's kind of like, it's a backfire.
3262640	3264640	Like when your muffler goes pop,
3264640	3267640	it's because something's happening with the pistons.
3267640	3268640	Your engine is going...
3268640	3273640	That's the insane thing is that our brains are designed
3273640	3282640	to go down these railroad tracks that we take for granted happen...
3282640	3285640	Slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap.
3285640	3290640	But there's absolutely no reason why a brain on a railroad track
3290640	3294640	can't, for instance, just go backward.
3294640	3299640	If, for instance, the entire railroad track should decide to fold in half.
3299640	3303640	Something that has more power over the railroad
3303640	3307640	than the people who built their little railroads.
3307640	3311640	Like, for instance, the god that created the entire planet.
3311640	3314640	The force of gravity.
3314640	3323640	To me, I've never had a deja vu that wasn't filled with an absolute sense of dread.
3323640	3326640	I didn't click send.
3326640	3328640	After the deja vu was over,
3328640	3334640	I declined to click send on a Sinbad bashing Instagram.
3334640	3343640	Because I was so convinced that I had been about to click send on this Sinbad bashing
3343640	3347640	that I was certain that when I clicked send, I was going to die.
3347640	3348640	Iron deficiency.
3348640	3349640	Iron deficiency.
3349640	3352640	I just need to eat more Jared tall.
3352640	3355640	Jeff, what was your friend's name? Alice?
3355640	3356640	Flarity.
3356640	3358640	Suitor boots?
3358640	3360640	Suitor boots.
3360640	3363640	She's a nay suitor boots.
3363640	3370640	I think your admiration of her is really beautiful.
3370640	3372640	I also think it's really funny that you're just...
3372640	3374640	Sorry, I just spit on Anna Tully.
3375640	3379640	Describing her home walking in and there being things hanging everywhere.
3379640	3381640	It's disconcerting.
3381640	3383640	This is by her description.
3383640	3384640	I've never been there.
3384640	3386640	It's her description of it.
3386640	3389640	She says that this hypergraphia, I think it's called,
3389640	3391640	where you write a lot...
3391640	3395640	If you are a bad writer and you write everywhere and you write on every surface,
3395640	3396640	they lock you up.
3396640	3403640	If you're a good writer and you're hypergraphic, you're Chaucer, you're Dostoyevsky,
3403640	3407640	there's people that have been hypergraphic throughout the ages that they cannot stop writing.
3407640	3410640	And there's a reason why we have these giant tomes by certain authors.
3410640	3414640	And she said the greatest thing I ever did was marry a publisher.
3416640	3422640	But she really does carry a certain kind of pen to write all the way up her wrists.
3422640	3426640	But also, she was hospitalized, I believe...
3426640	3427640	Shocking.
3428640	3434640	She kind of melted down and said, you can't self-diagnose yourself.
3434640	3437640	We have to put you away for a while.
3437640	3440640	And she's like, no, I can do this.
3440640	3443640	But she wouldn't sleep and she would build things.
3443640	3447640	That's why I don't believe in psychiatry or psychology.
3448640	3449640	Why?
3449640	3454640	Because there's a disease you can diagnose called being awesome.
3455640	3461640	They call it superiority complex is a diagnosable thing.
3461640	3467640	You can go to a qualified doctor and you can tell them how you feel
3467640	3472640	and they can tell you that you have a diagnosable thing called superiority complex.
3472640	3477640	And I'm like, okay, that may be true for an inferior person.
3478640	3483640	However, you may need to dig deeper than that, parasites.
3484640	3487640	Keep going.
3487640	3491640	Yes, I have a complex about how superior I am.
3491640	3495640	Superiority complex isn't superior enough a name for what I have.
3495640	3502640	Yeah, but I'm being glib, but that's the failing of studying the mind.
3504640	3507640	Don't laugh. I mean, do laugh.
3507640	3510640	I was laughing because you put the mind in quotes.
3510640	3517640	Well, I'm saying this idea that you can circumscribe intellect has this huge feeling.
3517640	3522640	Everyone that we've ever, everyone that built the world that we're sitting in,
3522640	3529640	we're sitting here under lights created by a guy that believed more than someone else
3529640	3534640	that you could illuminate this room after sundown.
3534640	3539640	And most importantly of all, we understand the universe we're living in
3539640	3543640	because of a guy who didn't believe, unlike everyone else,
3543640	3548640	that the reason light seems to travel the same speed no matter what point of departure it has
3548640	3552640	isn't because there's some unseen jello we all live in called the ether.
3552640	3554640	It's because E equals MC squared.
3554640	3556640	That guy was out of his fucking mind.
3556640	3562640	If Einstein had gone to a therapist, they would have told him so many times, knock it off.
3562640	3565640	They would have said, like, do you really think,
3565640	3569640	thinking that light is a variable is getting you anywhere?
3569640	3571640	No, I guess not.
3571640	3577640	Don't you think you should comb your hair and change your sweater and fucking go work at IKEA?
3577640	3579640	Fuck, fuck, fuck therapists.
3579640	3583640	And I'm not saying that anyone that has a problem with therapy is going to be Einstein.
3583640	3586640	I'm just saying, fuck you, therapy.
3586640	3588640	You just hate change.
3588640	3591640	I don't wait. I love change.
3591640	3593640	What are you talking? I hate change.
3593640	3596640	Einstein loved change.
3596640	3599640	He was like, change everything all the time.
3599640	3602640	He died going, I didn't change enough.
3602640	3605640	Stephen Hawking is like, I can't change enough.
3605640	3608640	Like, he's trying to change everything every day.
3608640	3612640	He's like, fuck my body.
3612640	3614640	Only my eyeballs can move.
3614640	3617640	I still want to prove how fucking retarded everything.
3617640	3620640	God damn it. I said it again.
3620640	3624640	You're especially always trying to, like, soak up positive.
3624640	3626640	You've come down pretty hard on a recharge.
3626640	3631640	My sister's retarded, so fuck everybody.
3631640	3634640	You can't keep cashing that chip in, man.
3634640	3637640	I mean, I gotta try.
3637640	3639640	I know I can't.
3639640	3644640	You especially seem to always seek out, like, positive things to change about yourself.
3644640	3648640	You just don't like therapists because they're not as smart as you most of the time,
3648640	3650640	because most people aren't as smart.
3650640	3651640	What reason do you need?
3651640	3653640	No, I don't need any. I agree with you.
3653640	3655640	I think that's a valid thing.
3655640	3657640	I don't think it has anything to do with change.
3657640	3660640	We have a hand shooting up, and we like to respect us at Harmatine.
3660640	3661640	Why is your hand shooting up?
3661640	3662640	I'm going to go for it.
3662640	3664640	No, I do.
3664640	3666640	Oh, whoa.
3666640	3667640	Well, it's a...
3667640	3670640	Thesis, I've been seeing...
3670640	3671640	Hello there, my name is Liz.
3671640	3672640	Hello.
3672640	3675640	Hey, fan.
3675640	3677640	We're in a safe place.
3677640	3680640	I have been seeing a therapist for four years, and he is much dumber than me.
3680640	3681640	All right.
3681640	3684640	And I think what you're saying about therapists is something that's untrue.
3684640	3686640	They don't try to make you act like a normal person.
3686640	3689640	I think you're a little bit angry because you don't actually have Asperger's,
3689640	3690640	and a therapist would tell you that.
3690640	3691640	They just have a jerk.
3691640	3693640	I don't believe that I have Asperger's.
3693640	3696640	I wouldn't fault anybody for telling me that.
3696640	3698640	Were you expecting a standing ovation for saying that?
3698640	3699640	It's also like a vigil.
3699640	3702640	Maybe it's not necessarily about someone being smarter than you,
3702640	3704640	but it's about...
3704640	3707640	I haven't found a great therapist,
3707640	3709640	and I don't think it's because I can't find anyone smarter than me,
3709640	3713640	but I think you have to find someone that works with you.
3713640	3715640	Wait, I want to...
3715640	3717640	Stick to the healthy core of what she's saying.
3717640	3719640	You're saying you're a reasonably intelligent person,
3719640	3722640	and you've been going to a therapist that you feel...
3722640	3724640	You can sense maybe...
3724640	3726640	Hopefully he's not listening, or she...
3726640	3729640	You feel like maybe they're...
3729640	3730640	They're dumber than you.
3731640	3734640	But you're achieving a benefit from meeting with this person,
3734640	3736640	so explain that, how that's possible,
3736640	3739640	how you can go to a therapist that you think is dumber than you,
3739640	3741640	and how that can benefit you.
3741640	3744640	I have health insurance from, I think, Anthem,
3744640	3748640	and it covers Adderall prescription for $5 a month.
3748640	3750640	So you have a drug dealer.
3750640	3751640	Yeah.
3751640	3752640	Yes.
3752640	3754640	And he's done because he gives you drugs,
3754640	3756640	and you don't need them, so that's great.
3756640	3757640	That's what you're saying.
3757640	3758640	Technically, I do need them.
3758640	3759640	I have ADHD.
3759640	3762640	I won't diagnose it because he doesn't believe in diagnoses.
3765640	3768640	I have a million and no questions.
3768640	3770640	I have negative five questions.
3770640	3772640	Yank the mic back.
3772640	3774640	But thank you.
3777640	3779640	Adderall's great.
3779640	3780640	Is there a piece five?
3780640	3782640	Like, everything we're...
3782640	3785640	I, and I think Dan feels the same way.
3786640	3790640	I think that realizing that arbitrary things,
3790640	3793640	like anything that makes you feel better,
3793640	3795640	like deciding that a chair,
3795640	3797640	every time you see a chair every day,
3797640	3800640	is going to remind you that humanity is important.
3800640	3803640	It's whatever fucking works for you.
3803640	3805640	Dan's not saying that therapy's bad.
3805640	3806640	Yeah, I am.
3806640	3807640	No, for you.
3807640	3809640	No, but you won't say definitively.
3809640	3810640	No, you don't.
3810640	3811640	You don't think it is.
3812640	3813640	But I do think...
3813640	3815640	I think there's a fucking danger in it.
3815640	3816640	I do.
3816640	3817640	I agree.
3817640	3821640	I think that the idea of therapy is founded by...
3821640	3825640	Like, there is no such thing as a revolutionary therapist.
3825640	3830640	There is no such thing as a person who sets up an office in a mini mall
3830640	3833640	and sits there with a clipboard and waits for patients to come in
3833640	3835640	and sign their health insurance forms
3835640	3837640	and can't wait to tell that person
3837640	3840640	that everything they thought walking in is bullshit!
3840640	3843640	And they had to go out and fuck it up!
3843640	3845640	But when someone comes to you and says,
3845640	3848640	Dan, I have a therapist and I don't know if I'm an asshole,
3848640	3851640	but this person works for me, you don't say to them,
3851640	3852640	that's not true!
3852640	3856640	Like, you're happy for people to do their own thing, right?
3856640	3857640	Marriage?
3860640	3862640	I mean, you're fine with people...
3862640	3866640	Yes, people who are already happy with the way things are going,
3866640	3868640	who are having weird speed bumps.
3869640	3870640	I think that there's ways.
3870640	3874640	We got another hand coming up from the middle of the crowd.
3877640	3878640	I don't know why.
3878640	3879640	I hope it's not...
3879640	3880640	Just, okay.
3880640	3882640	I won't say what I hope it's not.
3882640	3883640	Hi.
3883640	3884640	Hello.
3884640	3885640	I'm a big fan.
3885640	3886640	All right.
3886640	3887640	Well, thank you.
3887640	3891640	I just want to say that I didn't go to therapy for a really long time
3891640	3894640	and I started going and she's amazing
3894640	3897640	and it's not because she tells me a thing new,
3897640	3900640	it's because she supports the ideas I already have
3900640	3903640	and she's a fucking awesome feminist and...
3903640	3905640	All right, now tell her she's wrong.
3906640	3908640	Tell her her feelings are bad.
3908640	3910640	Tell her her joy is wrong.
3911640	3912640	Okay, all right.
3912640	3915640	Tell her she should buy a bottle of booze.
3917640	3919640	Oh, I drink plenty.
3920640	3922640	Are you willing to say your name?
3922640	3923640	Yeah, I'm Zoe.
3923640	3924640	Hi, everybody.
3924640	3925640	Hi.
3926640	3927640	I did go...
3927640	3928640	Okay.
3929640	3930640	Okay, all right.
3930640	3932640	Here's where I come clean.
3933640	3936640	I went to a therapist once who I think was awesome.
3936640	3938640	Whoa!
3940640	3941640	Shit!
3941640	3943640	He was way too expensive.
3943640	3944640	Way too expensive.
3946640	3947640	Like if I had...
3947640	3951640	My mental health would have cost me my home, my everything.
3951640	3953640	I would have been under a bridge being like,
3954640	3958640	I get why this bridge deserves to be over me.
3959640	3962640	I just fucking bailed because I got nervous
3962640	3965640	because he was not covered by Blue Cross or Blue Shield or anything.
3965640	3967640	And I just bailed.
3968640	3969640	He was Jungian.
3969640	3971640	He told me...
3971640	3973640	I'm saying like Zoe's saying like,
3973640	3975640	she's probably a feminist.
3975640	3977640	She went to a therapist who's a feminist.
3977640	3980640	In other words, to extrapolate that,
3980640	3984640	you went to a therapist who's actually so activated that,
3984640	3987640	yeah, you didn't feel like you were sitting in a strip mall
3987640	3989640	with somebody who was an agent of compromise.
3989640	3990640	No.
3990640	3992640	She challenges me, but if I tell her,
3992640	3993640	that's not how I feel.
3993640	3994640	She totally acts up.
3994640	3996640	She wants you to be who you are and who she is.
3996640	3998640	Zoe actually doesn't have a mic right now.
3998640	4000640	That's just how activated she is.
4000640	4002640	She's booming out.
4002640	4003640	Her sense of self-worth is that...
4003640	4008640	I did go to a guy who was like this amazing guy
4008640	4012640	who was a Jungian guy who told me in our first session,
4012640	4013640	he said, go home.
4013640	4017640	It was all Jungian stuff and I'm into Campbell and I...
4017640	4019640	So you love therapy.
4019640	4022640	I liked talking to this guy a little bit, kind of,
4022640	4024640	but it was like...
4024640	4028640	You got money now, go back to him, man.
4028640	4031640	But I'm telling you, I could be mentally unhealthy
4031640	4032640	and driving around on a Tesla.
4032640	4034640	This Jungian guy was Carl Jung.
4035640	4038640	Zoe, can you pass the mic to me?
4038640	4040640	I'm just saying, you should see my therapist.
4040640	4042640	She's really supportive.
4042640	4045640	Can we bring her to Harman Town?
4045640	4047640	Shelly Wilson.
4047640	4048640	That's her name.
4048640	4050640	E-Y.
4050640	4055640	Just really quick, you like talking to a person,
4055640	4058640	but not the title therapist.
4058640	4061640	You like talking to a person and relaying things
4062640	4065640	and actually having a conversation with someone
4065640	4068640	you feel has the credentials to talk to you,
4068640	4073640	but the therapist, the title therapist,
4073640	4077640	it gives them the right to take money from you
4077640	4080640	and all this stuff for just talking to a person.
4080640	4081640	Right.
4081640	4083640	What are you saying?
4083640	4085640	That's how I feel.
4085640	4088640	Well, from what I'm taking, from what you're saying.
4089640	4091640	Yes, that's how I feel.
4091640	4094640	It's like a dentist, but for your brain.
4094640	4095640	That's not fair.
4095640	4097640	There's a million bad dentists.
4097640	4099640	They're like, oh, your teeth are fucked up.
4099640	4101640	I'm going to drill here and drill there.
4101640	4102640	They're fucked up.
4102640	4104640	They don't go to school.
4104640	4107640	What they learn at school is how many teeth people have.
4107640	4110640	They don't learn what it takes to fucking bite.
4110640	4112640	I'm agreeing with you.
4112640	4115640	But Zoe is saying, yeah.
4115640	4118640	It's like if therapists were called expert life livers.
4118640	4119640	Yeah.
4119640	4122640	You'd question everything about them,
4122640	4124640	but it's all different.
4124640	4125640	I figure I know.
4125640	4127640	This has been a long time coming.
4127640	4129640	I'm glad this size audience came here.
4129640	4131640	I've always been waiting to be called out on this.
4131640	4133640	I know I need to go back to therapy.
4133640	4137640	I know that nobody needs therapy more than me.
4139640	4141640	Someone woo.
4142640	4149640	One of your ex-girlfriends is in the back and is cheering.
4149640	4152640	Somebody cheered like they were at a Bon Jovi concert.
4152640	4154640	And I very much respect.
4154640	4156640	I'm not even sure, young lady, what was your name?
4156640	4157640	Michelle.
4157640	4158640	Michelle.
4158640	4160640	I'm not even sure if you're on my side or Zoe's side
4160640	4163640	or somewhere in between, but I respect everybody
4163640	4166640	who's saying, look, that takes bravery.
4166640	4169640	We're in a big throng where obviously all you'd have to do
4169640	4172640	to be on my side is go, fuck therapy.
4172640	4173640	And yet there's...
4173640	4175640	We have a hand up over here.
4175640	4177640	She's becoming town hall.
4177640	4178640	She is a therapist.
4178640	4179640	Come on down.
4179640	4180640	Come on down.
4180640	4182640	Come on down.
4182640	4185640	Are you willing to come up?
4185640	4190640	Expert life, liver, ombre, sweater, looking healthy.
4190640	4192640	Well, are you okay coming up?
4192640	4194640	We don't bully people here.
4194640	4197640	Do you take writer's guild insurance?
4198640	4199640	Have you been to the show before?
4199640	4200640	Yes.
4200640	4201640	I'm a big fan.
4201640	4202640	So, you know, we never pick on people.
4202640	4203640	No one's going to pick on you here.
4203640	4205640	Now for a testing match.
4205640	4206640	But it's okay.
4206640	4207640	You said you got pushed up here,
4207640	4208640	but you're okay being up here, right?
4208640	4209640	I'm okay being up here.
4209640	4210640	Okay. All right. What's your name?
4210640	4211640	My name's Amber.
4211640	4212640	Dr. Amber.
4212640	4213640	Dr. Amber.
4215640	4216640	I just got licensed.
4216640	4218640	This Friday on the CW.
4220640	4222640	I'm so excited about the show.
4222640	4223640	This has been a long time coming.
4223640	4227640	I really need to have my face rubbed in this section of the carpet.
4228640	4231640	I've been talking a lot of shit a long time about therapy.
4231640	4234640	I don't have a problem with what you've said.
4235640	4237640	If I did, it would go a little something.
4239640	4242640	Therapists are professional helpers.
4242640	4245640	And like any doctor, if you don't like the first one,
4245640	4247640	you find another one that you do like.
4247640	4250640	There are a lot of shitty therapists
4250640	4253640	and therapists that take advantage of people
4253640	4255640	or are egotistical themselves.
4255640	4260640	But I went to school for a long time to learn techniques to help.
4260640	4262640	Like Zoe's therapists and others,
4262640	4264640	some of them you find a good connection with someone
4264640	4268640	who's going to be real with you and lead you to be a better you.
4268640	4270640	Well, there's two things.
4270640	4272640	Just in the short time that you talked,
4272640	4275640	I was like, I want to say this, I want to say that.
4276640	4278640	The...
4278640	4280640	I charge...
4281640	4283640	I'm sorry, our time is up.
4286640	4290640	I really hope, Amber, that you get some money out of this.
4290640	4293640	When you go, I'll give her a pile of it.
4294640	4297640	You have to give it to 826LA, though.
4298640	4302640	But when people go to study teeth in dental school,
4302640	4307640	what they learn is that there's a certain amount of teeth
4307640	4310640	that they exist in an ideal condition
4310640	4312640	in a certain row and things like that.
4312640	4314640	So the thing that scares me immediately
4314640	4318640	is the idea of the human mind as an array of features
4318640	4321640	that's supposed to be arranged in a certain order.
4321640	4325640	That's the first thing that scares guys in my profession.
4325640	4327640	I'm not unique in that way.
4327640	4330640	Every hack writer in the world wants to hold onto his specialness
4330640	4332640	and thinks that it's going to be taken away.
4332640	4334640	And I tell 9 out of 10 of those people,
4334640	4336640	fuck you, you hack.
4336640	4341640	Stop using the fact that you did a rewrite on the past
4341640	4345640	with John Leguizamo as an excuse to be mean to your girlfriend.
4345640	4348640	Go to therapy, you're being an asshole.
4348640	4351640	But me, that's a different matter.
4351640	4352640	I really...
4352640	4354640	I got something to protect over here.
4354640	4357640	How do you respond to that idea that...
4357640	4359640	like other sciences are like...
4359640	4361640	like a doctor goes,
4361640	4363640	okay, this is what a bone is supposed to do.
4363640	4364640	This is what a tooth is supposed to do.
4364640	4366640	This is what a liver is supposed to look like.
4366640	4368640	When you're dealing with the human mind,
4368640	4371640	not the brain, but the mind, the personality,
4371640	4372640	how do you guys...
4372640	4377640	what do they teach you in...
4377640	4378640	In a 144 character.
4378640	4381640	To account for the fact that some people actually
4381640	4383640	are supposed to be a little bit crazy.
4383640	4386640	I think number one is we've had a lot of trouble
4386640	4389640	even being seen as a science.
4389640	4390640	And I'm a psychologist.
4390640	4392640	Not a psychiatrist, right.
4392640	4393640	I don't prescribe medication.
4393640	4395640	I do talk therapy and those kind of interventions.
4395640	4398640	So I see the human mind as messy.
4398640	4400640	It is not just black and white.
4400640	4404640	We're taught ways to get you to function better.
4404640	4405640	What's your definition of not functioning?
4405640	4407640	I don't want to cut you off.
4407640	4408640	That's it.
4408640	4411640	What's your definition of not functioning?
4411640	4418640	What's your definition of it not functioning?
4418640	4420640	If somebody comes up to you, I would hope,
4420640	4422640	if somebody said to you,
4422640	4425640	I'm having fights with my girlfriend.
4425640	4430640	I am going to marry her in November.
4430640	4433640	This is totally hypothetical about that.
4433640	4436640	He's asking for a friend.
4436640	4439640	How do you account for...
4439640	4440640	I don't know.
4440640	4442640	I want to ask you a million questions,
4442640	4444640	but I guess I'm supposed to pay for it.
4444640	4445640	Well, how many patients do you have?
4445640	4447640	What fields do they come from?
4447640	4449640	Where's your office?
4449640	4451640	How long have you been doing this?
4451640	4454640	I just finished my postdoc a couple months ago,
4454640	4456640	so I'm starting to work at the VA.
4456640	4457640	I don't have a start date yet.
4457640	4458640	That's my new job.
4458640	4460640	You're working with veterans?
4460640	4465640	It'll be, yeah, it's like a veteran hospital in West L.A.
4465640	4468640	But I was working in a private practice in Studio City,
4468640	4472640	and we saw kids and teens with autism and ADHD,
4472640	4474640	and I saw just regular adults,
4474640	4476640	and I worked at Kaiser for my internship,
4476640	4479640	where we saw everyone, any walk of life,
4479640	4483640	psychosis to I'm just having trouble with my fiancé.
4483640	4487640	So not to put you at a spot, but if you could...
4487640	4491640	What is your definition of...
4491640	4493640	I don't even want to say an unhealthy mind.
4493640	4497640	I want to say...
4497640	4501640	I would say if the people around you are worried,
4501640	4505640	and there's a consensus that you could be doing better,
4505640	4507640	that would be indication number one.
4507640	4509640	That's terrifying.
4509640	4512640	That's Donald Sutherland in Body Snatchers.
4512640	4514640	If there's a consensus that you could be...
4514640	4517640	I mean, you know how that sounds.
4517640	4519640	But it would also be,
4519640	4521640	do you think you could be doing better?
4521640	4523640	I mean, when someone comes into my office...
4523640	4525640	But what if I think I could be doing better
4525640	4528640	if everyone else thinks I could be doing better?
4528640	4530640	And what if I don't trust them?
4530640	4533640	Then I'd start thinking about certain diagnoses.
4533640	4536640	Then you send me to a psychiatrist.
4536640	4538640	But I would want to talk to those people
4538640	4540640	and spend more than just five minutes in a strip mall
4540640	4541640	with a clipboard.
4541640	4544640	I would spend a couple hours talking to you about
4544640	4545640	what's really going on.
4545640	4546640	What are you worried about?
4546640	4549640	Why are you concerned about coming to see me, even?
4549640	4550640	I mean, you've already...
4550640	4551640	It's always...
4551640	4553640	I'll answer your question.
4553640	4556640	Although I'm not coming to see you.
4556640	4558640	The last 11 therapists...
4558640	4560640	This is called playing hard to get.
4560640	4563640	The last 11 times I've gone to a therapist
4563640	4566640	it's always been because it's make or break with the...
4566640	4569640	I'm always on the verge of like,
4569640	4571640	I'm hurting somebody that I'm with.
4571640	4573640	I would say you've waited too long.
4573640	4579640	I'm not.
4579640	4582640	I'm waiting for my mic to turn into a bouquet of flowers.
4582640	4587640	I just mean that if...
4587640	4589640	I think most people make the mistake of...
4589640	4590640	Waiting until...
4590640	4591640	It's a last resort.
4591640	4592640	I get that.
4592640	4595640	And I'm not a couple's therapist, but...
4595640	4597640	She's not on your side, Erin.
4597640	4599640	You're not listening to what she's really saying.
4599640	4603640	Some people do preemptive marriage counseling
4603640	4605640	or couples counseling to...
4605640	4607640	But that's like picking a scab, right?
4607640	4609640	It's like, you should have dealt with this
4609640	4610640	when it was bleeding.
4610640	4611640	No, no, no.
4611640	4619640	I think preemptive counseling is cool because...
4619640	4623640	I think it's super rad.
4623640	4627640	It's totally Bieber.
4627640	4630640	I mean, I'm really happy with our relationship right now,
4630640	4633640	but we do have a few communication issues,
4633640	4636640	so it would be nice to kind of work out a game plan
4636640	4640640	or just kind of have a...
4640640	4642640	This isn't one of the problems I would be coming to you with,
4642640	4646640	is that I have a fiancé who tries to parlay any situation
4646640	4648640	at their political advantage.
4648640	4649640	I feel like...
4649640	4651640	That's not true.
4651640	4652640	Wait, wait.
4652640	4654640	Somebody is starving to stage.
4654640	4656640	Yeah, premarital counseling.
4656640	4658640	Can you take that mic?
4658640	4659640	Yeah, sure.
4659640	4661640	I'm coming humbly.
4661640	4663640	Well, go sit behind the table.
4663640	4665640	I'm coming humbly.
4665640	4667640	Or he's just going to...
4667640	4668640	What's your name, sir?
4668640	4669640	James Lively.
4669640	4670640	James Lively?
4670640	4673640	Fake name.
4673640	4676640	I do fake name counseling.
4676640	4677640	Here's what's cool.
4677640	4679640	You could go with maybe a John Smith or a...
4679640	4682640	My name is most likely.
4682640	4685640	My grandfather was a Hollywood writer.
4685640	4686640	No, no, no.
4686640	4687640	Crazy alcoholic.
4687640	4688640	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
4688640	4689640	Sorry.
4689640	4691640	And I went to couples therapy.
4691640	4693640	And I went to couples therapy.
4693640	4694640	Okay, so...
4694640	4698640	Why do you have a microphone in your hand right now?
4698640	4701640	I don't know, like this undeserving douchebag that came up here.
4701640	4702640	That's what I am.
4702640	4704640	No, but you have something to say about couples therapy.
4704640	4708640	Yeah, so if we track back the conversation a little bit, what's interesting...
4708640	4712640	If you go back to your comment about diagnosing people...
4712640	4715640	No, diagnosing people have a superiority complex.
4715640	4718640	It's troubling because it's like those people are Darwinian geniuses.
4718640	4720640	They're going to take us all over, right?
4720640	4725640	They're like the technocratic, capitalistic geniuses.
4725640	4731640	But what's interesting about therapy is it's like a bunch of angst-ridden people
4731640	4734640	who decided that human compassion is actually more important.
4734640	4739640	That's why they're diagnosing things like superiority complex.
4739640	4742640	You expected an applause break that you did not get.
4742640	4743640	No, no, no, no.
4743640	4745640	And then you were kind of like...
4745640	4746640	No, no.
4746640	4749640	You know, as long as we're doing philosophy though, I'm like,
4749640	4753640	you're a Socrates, you care enough to listen to like a rambling idiot like myself.
4754640	4759640	Mr. Lively, you came up to support couples therapy, right?
4759640	4760640	No, no, no.
4760640	4762640	Did I misunderstand?
4762640	4763640	No, what's interesting?
4763640	4764640	I missed a thesis.
4764640	4766640	What's going on?
4766640	4768640	Yeah, I don't know that there's much of a thesis.
4768640	4771640	Get the fuck off the stage!
4771640	4773640	Yeah, you can send me back that.
4773640	4775640	We can't all be on stage.
4775640	4777640	Yeah, you're right.
4777640	4781640	But it is notable that there are so many people that are shooting their hands up
4782640	4784640	in support of therapy.
4784640	4787640	There's got to be a way for you to gracefully receive.
4787640	4788640	I have a way.
4788640	4790640	Let's supplant James Lively.
4790640	4792640	Thank you very much James Lively.
4792640	4794640	Let's bring up Spencer Crichton.
4794640	4795640	Is he here?
4795640	4797640	Spencer's not here.
4797640	4798640	He's not here?
4798640	4800640	He's not here!
4800640	4802640	He's not here?
4802640	4804640	He's not here.
4804640	4806640	Don't tell James Lively that.
4806640	4809640	I was sent here with a message for you.
4809640	4810640	Oh shit.
4810640	4812640	Where's Spencer?
4812640	4815640	He would like to take the week off.
4815640	4817640	Spencer has grown up.
4817640	4819640	Remember when Greg Brady got his...
4819640	4820640	Thank you James.
4820640	4821640	Thank you.
4821640	4823640	I have no idea what happened, but thank you.
4823640	4824640	Sorry.
4824640	4826640	Sorry, young lady.
4826640	4828640	Give Dr. Amber a hand.
4828640	4830640	We were making headway here.
4830640	4831640	She gave it to me.
4831640	4832640	She wants to leave.
4832640	4833640	Yes.
4833640	4839640	Dan, would you consider seeing somebody like Dr. Amber or somebody in her ilk?
4839640	4841640	I don't know if I would...
4841640	4844640	If her name was Dr. Amber, I would...
4844640	4847640	I would feel too nervous that when I came home,
4847640	4849640	my fiancé asked me how it went with Dr. Amber,
4849640	4852640	I would be like, uh, fine.
4852640	4860640	I'd be like, were you in a porno?
4860640	4863640	Earlier you said that Dr. Amber wasn't on my side.
4863640	4868640	Yes, you were, right?
4868640	4870640	Amber, Amber, don't take sides.
4870640	4873640	Not in a on my side thing.
4873640	4877640	I mean, things are fine with us.
4877640	4878640	Everything's fine.
4878640	4879640	No, I know.
4879640	4881640	We could have some tools.
4881640	4883640	We could use some tools.
4883640	4885640	Dan, let's just say hypothetically,
4885640	4889640	you started going to sessions with Dr. Amber, let's say.
4889640	4891640	But Erin started...
4891640	4894640	She comes back smelling like pina coladas.
4894640	4899640	But Erin started also seeing one of her other doctors...
4899640	4900640	Dr. Thor.
4900640	4903640	Dr. Thor.
4903640	4904640	We need an asana.
4904640	4907640	That's where his office is, Dan.
4907640	4908640	I wanted to actually...
4908640	4910640	I think that Dr. Amber,
4910640	4913640	I think that's a weird name to give a person who's a doctor.
4913640	4917640	It sounds like a strip cheese is imminent.
4917640	4920640	I think it's valuable that I, for the last, at least...
4920640	4922640	I have at least a year and a half.
4922640	4924640	Get those dollars out, gentlemen.
4924640	4928640	Taking a shit on the profession of therapy in general,
4928640	4930640	and I don't know.
4930640	4934640	I would like to hear out any perspective from that side.
4934640	4938640	We never have anybody up here who has the guts to say,
4938640	4940640	okay, I do that thing for a living,
4940640	4942640	and I'm not a piece of shit.
4942640	4945640	I don't prey on people, and I'm not an agent of compromise.
4945640	4948640	I do just want people to feel good about themselves,
4948640	4950640	regardless of how crazy they are.
4950640	4952640	That's the thing that I want to understand.
4952640	4954640	She likes you and appreciates you.
4954640	4955640	I like Dr. Amber.
4955640	4956640	I think you should go to Dr. Amber.
4956640	4958640	We're not...
4958640	4962640	Amber, how many times have you heard or have been to?
4962640	4964640	Oh, I listen regularly.
4964640	4966640	You should go to Dr. Amber.
4966640	4968640	I don't want to go.
4968640	4969640	This is about where I go.
4969640	4971640	This is a larger, important issue.
4971640	4973640	I have a follow-up question.
4973640	4974640	Is there...
4974640	4977640	Does something come to your mind that you...
4977640	4980640	I didn't ask you to diagnose Dan, but...
4980640	4982640	But you will in this moment.
4982640	4984640	But having heard...
4984640	4989640	Basically, Harmontown is nothing more than just a huge soliloquy
4989640	4992640	of what's going on with him.
4992640	4995640	Is there any diagnosis that comes to mind?
4995640	4999640	You don't have an answer.
4999640	5002640	I mean, honestly, I don't have an answer for that.
5002640	5003640	There isn't one that comes to mind.
5003640	5005640	It's not really your business diagnosed, right?
5005640	5008640	No, I shouldn't diagnose having just heard a podcast in here.
5008640	5009640	But also...
5009640	5010640	Yes.
5010640	5013640	Dr. Amber for a long time.
5013640	5016640	Maybe we all be stuck in Amber.
5016640	5018640	A psychologist doesn't diagnose, do they?
5018640	5020640	Because they don't prescribe it anymore.
5020640	5021640	No, we do diagnose.
5021640	5023640	We use the DSM-5 now.
5023640	5027640	But that is by the American Psychiatric Association.
5027640	5029640	These all sound like real things.
5029640	5031640	They are real.
5031640	5034640	But, you know, they're the ones that can push medication
5034640	5036640	and so if they come up with diagnoses,
5036640	5039640	more of you can qualify for those medications.
5039640	5042640	If I took insurance and you came to me
5042640	5046640	and I wanted to be reimbursed for helping you and everything,
5046640	5048640	I would need to give you a diagnosis.
5048640	5050640	You would leave the office with a diagnosis.
5050640	5052640	Kind of a conflict of interest, then.
5052640	5053640	It's a terrible system.
5053640	5055640	Because you need to actually come up with a label
5055640	5059640	for a person who happens to just have a problem with the way the world is.
5059640	5062640	What a weird conflict of interest.
5063640	5067640	That's not to say that you have wasted your life and your occupation
5067640	5069640	or that you're not a good person.
5069640	5072640	But I will say that means I'm fucking right.
5072640	5075640	That is fucking horse shit.
5075640	5077640	That's capitalism in action.
5077640	5079640	If you have a problem with the way the world works,
5079640	5081640	you're supposed to go to someone in the kiosk
5081640	5085640	and they are beholden, not to your condition,
5085640	5086640	not to your happiness,
5086640	5088640	and not even to the happiness of anyone around you,
5088640	5091640	but to the happiness of your fucking healthcare provider.
5091640	5097640	They're beholden to corporations, definitions of mental health.
5097640	5100640	There is no such thing as mental health.
5100640	5102640	It is defined by a corporation.
5102640	5107640	A corporation defines normality as corporations being human beings.
5107640	5110640	They're having votes influencing society.
5110640	5112640	That's insanity.
5112640	5117640	It's insanity that corporations have any power over anybody.
5117640	5119640	That's automatically insane.
5119640	5122640	You wake up in an insane world.
5122640	5124640	You wake up in a world of psychosis.
5124640	5128640	So by definition, if you feel psychotic,
5128640	5131640	if you think rivers are red and the sky is purple,
5131640	5134640	you may possibly be sane.
5134640	5137640	You may be the only sane person in the world.
5137640	5140640	Taste the rainbow?
5140640	5142640	Fuck you, Skittles.
5142640	5144640	You can't taste a rainbow.
5144640	5146640	Tasting Dr. Amberg.
5146640	5147640	Code red.
5147640	5150640	They will tell you that you can taste a rainbow.
5150640	5151640	Code rainbow.
5151640	5155640	And it's not your fault, but you are part of the beehive,
5155640	5158640	and that's why I don't do it.
5158640	5161640	Do you have any pets, Dr. Amber?
5161640	5163640	I have two cats.
5163640	5165640	You have two cats that are in her name.
5165640	5166640	Dolly and Jesse.
5166640	5169640	Dolly and Jesse.
5169640	5171640	Go to Dr. Amber.
5171640	5172640	Well, listen.
5172640	5176640	I went to school not to learn what the diagnoses are,
5176640	5179640	but I went to school to learn how to help people
5179640	5181640	who present with a certain problem.
5181640	5184640	Lots of psychologists, lots of people are unhappy with the DSM,
5184640	5187640	if people know what that is, the big book of mental illness.
5187640	5190640	There's huge controversy about it,
5190640	5193640	but I can still be a psychologist and throw some label on something
5193640	5195640	but still treat the real issue.
5195640	5198640	If you have something you want to work on, we work on that,
5198640	5202640	and I don't think too much about something I wrote on an insurance form.
5202640	5204640	But you have to write something.
5204640	5206640	If I take insurance, I have to.
5206640	5208640	If I took cash, I'd say, you're just troubled, let's just talk.
5208640	5210640	How much cash would you take?
5210640	5212640	How much are you willing to do?
5212640	5213640	You have to make sure.
5213640	5215640	Well, fucking too much for me to keep coming back.
5215640	5218640	If I happen to be a really smart fucking dude
5218640	5221640	who had a bunch of fucking problems,
5221640	5224640	I would go bankrupt trying to set my mind straight.
5224640	5225640	Maybe.
5225640	5226640	For sure.
5226640	5229640	I mean, most charge between $150 and $200 an hour.
5229640	5230640	What?
5230640	5237640	The dude that was working on me was charging more than my rent a month.
5237640	5239640	It was like, I loved it.
5239640	5243640	He was great, but fucking whatever.
5243640	5247640	Apparently, being mentally healthy means you can't live in this society,
5247640	5252640	which is what I thought walking in the door.
5252640	5254640	That's what makes me crazy.
5254640	5259640	If tomorrow seems weird, maybe it needs to keep seeming weird.
5259640	5261640	I don't know.
5261640	5263640	If you're talking to a fire hydrant,
5263640	5266640	everybody drives by you and pats their pockets as they walk by.
5266640	5268640	Oh, I'm sorry, I can't help you.
5268640	5270640	You keep sliding the lever down from there.
5270640	5272640	It's like, oh, I'm talking to a fire hydrant.
5272640	5273640	Well, I'm talking to a rainbow.
5273640	5274640	I'm talking to a palm tree.
5274640	5275640	I'm talking to children.
5275640	5276640	I'm talking to the concept of happiness.
5276640	5277640	I'm talking to the TV industry.
5277640	5279640	Oh, my dad worked in TV.
5279640	5281640	Oh, I had a job.
5281640	5283640	Meanwhile, somebody else is like, well, I might be talking to a fire hydrant,
5283640	5285640	but I've got to be a dishwasher.
5285640	5286640	But my family doesn't have any money,
5286640	5288640	so I'm out in the street and wandering around,
5288640	5291640	and I'm trying to get myself in the head.
5291640	5295640	And some of those people are Habsburgs, like in the 17th century.
5295640	5297640	It depends on the support system.
5297640	5298640	It's fucking money.
5298640	5300640	Everybody's got chemical imbalances.
5300640	5302640	Everybody's got a blue drop of liquid in their brain
5302640	5304640	and a green drop of liquid,
5304640	5306640	and it's like a little balance in their head.
5306640	5307640	Shamanism.
5307640	5311640	Good news is no one's going to make you go to therapy.
5311640	5313640	I know nobody's going to make me go to therapy.
5313640	5316640	I'm trying to set the shit straight once and for all.
5316640	5317640	I'm shuffling off this mortal coil.
5317640	5321640	I'm done with this planet.
5321640	5322640	I have done.
5322640	5323640	I made it.
5323640	5325640	I fucking won.
5325640	5327640	I don't need shit.
5327640	5330640	What I would like to do is look back on this Monopoly game
5330640	5336640	from wherever Beyond Go is and go, fuck you people.
5336640	5338640	What did you think was the point of the game?
5338640	5339640	It's called jail.
5339640	5340640	How many?
5343640	5346640	Because, I mean, if the point of the game is to have a certain amount
5346640	5348640	of red hotels and a certain amount of squares,
5348640	5350640	I just want to understand.
5350640	5352640	What do I have to do to be a good person?
5352640	5354640	Because I want to have a kid.
5354640	5355640	I want to have two kids.
5355640	5360640	I want to spend the rest of my life.
5360640	5363640	I want to slowly crumble into a skeleton
5363640	5367640	and crumble into dust and leave a kid behind me.
5367640	5370640	You want to leave a kid behind a skeleton?
5370640	5371640	Yes, Jeff.
5371640	5373640	That's called parenthood.
5373640	5374640	Yes.
5374640	5377640	You don't want to leave a kid in front of a skeleton.
5377640	5379640	That's bad.
5379640	5381640	Hey, Dad, let's throw up baseball.
5381640	5382640	Oh, my God.
5382640	5385640	Oh, my God.
5385640	5386640	I'm sorry.
5386640	5387640	You're stranded up here.
5387640	5391640	Do you have any final words for your vocation?
5391640	5394640	I think you seem like a really...
5394640	5395640	I like Dr. Amber.
5395640	5396640	Definitely a hero for coming up here.
5396640	5398640	I also like Dr. Amber.
5398640	5400640	Is there anything else?
5400640	5404640	Dr. Amber!
5404640	5407640	I feel like I have to give some sort of message.
5407640	5410640	Therapy's not for everyone, but if you're interested,
5410640	5412640	try a few until you find one that works.
5412640	5414640	You heard people talk about it tonight,
5414640	5417640	and it is just finding a connection with someone else.
5417640	5422640	If it's not a therapist, your podcast is your therapy, I think.
5422640	5423640	Would you agree...
5423640	5425640	Okay, so stay up here for a second.
5425640	5428640	Now you're trapped, because this brings up a good point.
5429640	5431640	The hunter can become the hunter.
5431640	5434640	A dentist gets to say, okay, this is where your molar should be.
5434640	5436640	If your molar's in the front, then something's wrong,
5436640	5437640	and the dentist can escape.
5437640	5439640	Why the teeth thing?
5439640	5442640	Because it's an easy analogy to compare it to another science.
5442640	5443640	Okay.
5443640	5444640	Okay.
5444640	5448640	So with the mind, as Amber is saying,
5448640	5450640	it's obviously more nuanced than that.
5450640	5453640	However, according to the insurance companies, it ain't.
5453640	5455640	That's the problem.
5455640	5458640	So what I'm saying to Amber is, in view of that,
5458640	5461640	and the fact that that's how it is,
5461640	5464640	is your suggestion to people like that,
5464640	5468640	unlike a dentist, with therapy,
5468640	5472640	it's beholden upon the consumer to actually explore
5472640	5474640	as much as they would with a romantic relationship.
5474640	5476640	You have to actually speed date.
5476640	5477640	Totally.
5477640	5482640	If you go to your first therapist and you're happy,
5482640	5484640	you're fucking up, maybe.
5484640	5485640	Yeah.
5485640	5489640	And you're not really talking to your dentist the way that you might.
5489640	5495640	And your teeth are set in order by order of six million years of evolution,
5495640	5498640	whereas your brain is, I'm saying,
5498640	5501640	so all of you out there who are happy with your first therapist,
5501640	5504640	you're about as happy as people who married out of high school.
5504640	5505640	Go fuck yourself.
5505640	5508640	Fuck you.
5508640	5510640	Fuck you.
5510640	5512640	Fuck all of you.
5513640	5516640	Enjoy your divorce.
5516640	5519640	Stacy and Steve.
5519640	5522640	Oh, you were so cute together, remember?
5522640	5524640	You fucked up.
5524640	5525640	What do you think the odds were?
5525640	5527640	Sorry, Zoe, you're raising your hand.
5527640	5529640	Zoe's back.
5529640	5533640	Amber's like, God damn it, what do I got to do to get out of here?
5533640	5534640	Act three.
5534640	5539640	So my first therapist was the one who helped me get out of my first happy marriage.
5539640	5541640	Okay, all right.
5541640	5542640	I'm serious.
5542640	5544640	All right, it's fine.
5544640	5548640	Well, when you put a human face on it, okay, it's fine, Zoe.
5548640	5552640	But don't you think your second therapist might have made you really mentally healthy?
5552640	5555640	To be fair, my therapist doesn't take insurance,
5555640	5557640	so she's not beholden to anyone.
5557640	5559640	I think you're a little jaded,
5559640	5562640	and people, if you need therapy, you should really pursue it.
5562640	5563640	Don't listen to this guy.
5563640	5565640	It's amazing.
5565640	5566640	I agree with that.
5566640	5568640	I agree with that.
5568640	5571640	Yeah, you don't want to listen to a fat, rich millionaire.
5571640	5572640	He doesn't speak for...
5572640	5573640	Yeah, I agree with that.
5573640	5575640	I'm also a millionaire, just...
5575640	5577640	Well, okay, now...
5577640	5579640	That doesn't...
5579640	5581640	It's not a competition, I'm saying.
5581640	5583640	I don't represent...
5583640	5585640	It was until it was.
5585640	5587640	A fat, rich millionaire with hair in his back.
5587640	5590640	Okay, I was a proper loss for a long time.
5590640	5591640	I didn't believe in therapy,
5591640	5595640	and then I was so unhappy that I started going, and it's incredible.
5596640	5598640	Everyone should do it if you want to.
5598640	5600640	First therapist, she's on her first therapist.
5600640	5601640	She's amazing.
5601640	5603640	She's amazing, first therapist.
5603640	5605640	Right out of high school.
5605640	5607640	I'm 29 years old.
5607640	5608640	What's that?
5608640	5609640	I'm 29 years old.
5609640	5611640	I've only been going to her for like a year.
5611640	5613640	Well, still, first therapist.
5613640	5615640	But seriously, it's someone who supports you
5615640	5617640	and cares about you, and they're unbiased.
5617640	5619640	Not as much as your second therapist.
5619640	5621640	I don't know, man.
5621640	5623640	So wait, are you saying my second husband
5623640	5626640	is going to like me better than my first husband did?
5626640	5627640	Yes.
5630640	5631640	I'm looking for...
5631640	5633640	I'm saying my first joke would get a bigger laugh
5633640	5635640	than the callback.
5637640	5639640	Don't be so mean to my first therapist.
5639640	5641640	She's really nice.
5642640	5643640	I believe you.
5643640	5645640	I believe you, Zoe.
5649640	5651640	You know what's happy when they get married out of high school?
5651640	5653640	It's totally different.
5655640	5656640	It's two different things.
5656640	5657640	Therapy.
5659640	5661640	Zoe, I believe you.
5661640	5663640	Zoe, I believe you.
5665640	5666640	I'm just saying, go to therapy if you want to.
5666640	5667640	It's amazing.
5667640	5668640	Yes.
5668640	5669640	Don't get married, though.
5669640	5670640	That's...
5675640	5676640	Never again.
5676640	5677640	Never again.
5680640	5682640	I think that's perfect, though.
5682640	5683640	I mean, that's perfect.
5683640	5686640	But really, everyone should stick with their first therapist.
5686640	5687640	They don't have to.
5687640	5688640	They go to...
5688640	5689640	No, no, it's fine.
5689640	5691640	That's the point, though.
5691640	5692640	I'm not being cynical.
5692640	5693640	I'm not being an asshole.
5693640	5694640	No, no, no.
5694640	5697640	What that represents is like the big pudding of...
5697640	5700640	Like, you should think of therapy.
5700640	5702640	I'm saying, Amber, you agree that...
5702640	5704640	Because you're being like...
5704640	5705640	And I don't want to throw you under the bus.
5705640	5709640	But you're saying, in this world where you have to...
5709640	5714640	Like, we should definitely all seek therapy, number one.
5714640	5716640	Number two, we should all be really picky.
5716640	5717640	I don't think she said that.
5717640	5718640	I don't think she said that.
5718640	5720640	No, she didn't say that we should all seek therapy.
5720640	5722640	Don't throw her under the bus at all.
5722640	5723640	I don't understand.
5723640	5725640	This is Amber!
5726640	5728640	All right, let's let Amber go.
5728640	5729640	We don't embarrass her anymore.
5729640	5730640	She did a good job.
5730640	5731640	Amber's a hero.
5731640	5733640	Dr. Amber, get stuck in Amber today.
5735640	5738640	Thank you very much.
5738640	5739640	She's great.
5739640	5741640	I hope we didn't embarrass her too much.
5741640	5743640	I thought she was...
5743640	5746640	All Harman Town fans that come up on stage are fantastic.
5746640	5747640	But that was a tough...
5747640	5749640	That was Daniel and the Lions done.
5749640	5752640	Dr. Amber, I think she acquitted herself quite nicely.
5752640	5753640	No, absolutely.
5753640	5755640	I also think it's kind of an interesting idea,
5755640	5758640	you meeting with a therapist who listens to the podcast,
5758640	5762640	because obviously they appreciate you in a certain way.
5762640	5764640	I also think Zoe's standing up and being like,
5764640	5766640	oh my God, my fucking therapist is...
5766640	5768640	No, I think it's great to love your therapist.
5768640	5773640	It all mitigates the whole thing.
5773640	5774640	All I do is stand up here and like,
5774640	5776640	I don't want to be like some jagged, weird,
5776640	5779640	charcoal rock guy going, yeah, therapist bullshit.
5779640	5781640	I'm going to cut you if you come near me.
5781640	5783640	Am I wrong?
5783640	5788640	Aaron, you support the idea of getting therapy.
5788640	5796640	You have two mics in your head, like a weird microphone porn.
5796640	5799640	It's so funny that I can move them in a way that makes it a...
5799640	5800640	Like there's a total...
5800640	5802640	Practice makes perfect.
5802640	5808640	Special video bonus for that joke.
5808640	5814640	What if I felt some weird pressure to blow a mic because of the video?
5814640	5823640	No, I mean Dan's fired up.
5823640	5824640	I'm into that.
5824640	5825640	Just to be general?
5825640	5833640	No, I mean speaking, there are passionate feelings on the podcast.
5833640	5835640	Answer the question.
5835640	5840640	You know, I don't actually think that Dan needs therapy.
5840640	5841640	You know why?
5841640	5843640	Because you told me to say that.
5843640	5848640	No, no, because turnabout's fair play.
5848640	5849640	That's why.
5849640	5852640	Because for the same reason I love her and I'm going to marry her.
5852640	5854640	Because she don't want to go to the same place.
5854640	5857640	But I also, because I have the same relationship with therapy,
5857640	5859640	but I also understand it.
5859640	5861640	I can't let go of the other mic.
5861640	5863640	The last mic she needs is me coming home again.
5863640	5865640	But I do want to do...
5865640	5870640	I would like to go to a couples therapist just so we can have tools.
5870640	5872640	Just for tools.
5872640	5875640	Erin, Erin, it's good news because I'm about to introduce a new segment.
5875640	5876640	No, no, no, no.
5876640	5879640	It's called Turnabout Therapy is Fair Play.
5879640	5883640	Where you guys each get to be each other's therapists for a moment.
5883640	5884640	Do you guys have any ideas?
5884640	5887640	No, everyone hates it.
5887640	5892640	The audience rejected your bit.
5892640	5894640	The audience doesn't want it.
5894640	5897640	It sounds like a bad idea.
5897640	5900640	They rejected it based on the title.
5900640	5903640	They're smarter than an NPC executive.
5903640	5905640	May I reveal...
5905640	5907640	They know a failure when they hear it.
5907640	5912640	May I reveal a fantasy?
5912640	5913640	Nice, yes.
5913640	5915640	I would like to reveal...
5915640	5918640	Do you have one more microphone?
5918640	5925640	May I reveal a fantasy?
5925640	5927640	Someone asked her, they flaccid.
5927640	5931640	Yes, they are, sir.
5931640	5932640	Yes, they are.
5932640	5933640	Don't tell her how to have a good...
5933640	5940640	Because they respect me.
5940640	5943640	They're passionate because they respect you.
5943640	5946640	Because they're going to listen to me.
5946640	5948640	And I haven't spoken yet.
5948640	5953640	They're going to become erect once I've said...
5953640	5958640	Erin subscribes to a really high-priced,
5958640	5961640	tedious brand of pornography.
5961640	5967640	In which a woman is surrounded by flaccid penises.
5967640	5969640	Okay.
5969640	5971640	All the men are like,
5971640	5973640	She's too much, bro.
5973640	5974640	I agree.
5974640	5976640	I just can't get turned on.
5976640	5978640	She's so smart.
5978640	5982640	I was going to come, but she made a really good point just now.
5982640	5989640	And the point is me rubbing my face against them like beaded curtains.
5989640	5992640	Okay, this is my fantasy.
5992640	5994640	This is my fantasy.
5994640	5997640	My fantasy just came true.
5997640	6000640	We only have a few minutes left.
6000640	6005640	We're going to keep this bullet train moving.
6005640	6011640	Dear Spencer is not here, but I have always fantasized.
6011640	6013640	I mean, I...
6013640	6014640	Oh, wow.
6014640	6015640	Wow.
6015640	6018640	I shouldn't be using the word fantasy.
6018640	6021640	It's no secret.
6021640	6027640	My beard gently nuzzles at your tits.
6027640	6034640	Slowly walking up behind you with polyhedral balls.
6034640	6038640	He takes a dice tower.
6038640	6045640	In my fantasy, Spencer has polyhedral balls.
6045640	6047640	No.
6047640	6051640	Yeah, that'd be neat.
6051640	6060640	I am not a celebrated, excellent player of D&D.
6061640	6071640	But I have always fantasized about maybe just dungeon mastering for a second.
6071640	6074640	If I could just dungeon...
6074640	6079640	Just my own world, I'll give you guys characters just out of my head,
6079640	6082640	and just let me do it for a second.
6082640	6086640	This could go horribly. I have no tickets anymore.
6087640	6092640	For no reason, she's moving to another microphone.
6092640	6097640	She has no dice. She could have stayed right where she was.
6097640	6098640	Oh, boy.
6098640	6102640	If you could play the music, and I'll recap what happened last week.
6102640	6107640	Really quick, Jeff's character is Pillarhead.
6107640	6112640	And Dan's character is Shania Twain.
6117640	6122640	I want to check in with Dr. Amber after this is done.
6122640	6124640	All right, Erin, you ready?
6124640	6126640	Yeah. Well, no, but...
6129640	6134640	Last week on Aarons and Dragons,
6134640	6140640	Pillarhead and Shania Twain were traveling through a dark cave filled with amethyst rock
6141640	6145640	and small boxes filled with presents.
6147640	6154640	Shania Twain didn't know what to get for her mother-in-law's birthday.
6156640	6164640	And Pillarhead was irritated by how much emphasis she was putting on her mother-in-law's birthday.
6164640	6169640	Also, a goblin named Nosferatu,
6169640	6176640	following after him with bags of blood that he was going to devour,
6176640	6183640	and then they were going to metabolize into flames of death.
6185640	6190640	Will Nosferatu catch up with Shania Twain and Pillarhead,
6191640	6200640	or will Pillarhead finally confess his love of pillars?
6202640	6208640	Who knows what will happen this week on Aarons and...
6211640	6214640	Dragons! Dragons!
6221640	6228640	Well, as a 17th-level samurai,
6228640	6237640	I take out my samurai sword, which has a plus 11 against Nosferatu goblins.
6237640	6242640	I do a lunging, dazzling display.
6242640	6246640	He's not in your visibility. You don't see him. He's falling behind you.
6247640	6251640	Right now, you're just looking for a present for Shania Twain's mother-in-law.
6252640	6259640	Okay. I amend that, and I do a dazzling shopping spree.
6260640	6262640	All right.
6266640	6270640	You find an appropriate hat.
6270640	6278640	Shania, I have found the appropriate hat.
6278640	6284640	My God, that's the hat that my ancestors swore I should hate.
6284640	6291640	Yes, but this hat will be nothing without an appropriate accoutrement.
6291640	6298640	I inspect my surroundings in really, really granular detail.
6301640	6314640	You look around the cave to the right. You see what looks like a plasticized Harrison Ford in Star Wars.
6314640	6316640	What?
6317640	6319640	Someone had a stroke.
6320640	6329640	You look and you see what looks like different gems trapped beneath an ice, but the ice is not cold.
6329640	6331640	Looks like Harrison Ford?
6331640	6334640	Well, it's kind of similar to Star Wars, where he's stuck in the thing.
6334640	6335640	Carbonite?
6335640	6336640	Carbonite?
6336640	6337640	Carbonite.
6337640	6339640	Okay. So there's gems frozen in a certain...
6339640	6343640	There are gems, and you see different shapes, and you also see tiny boxes.
6343640	6345640	Over to the right.
6345640	6349640	Shania Twain, use your ability to unfreeze gems.
6349640	6352640	I'd just like to keep looking around for a second.
6352640	6356640	I just want to keep looking. I saw that, and I just keep looking.
6356640	6359640	I'm turning my head really slowly, and I'm taking every detail.
6359640	6371640	You see in front of you a giant golden swan, mouth beak agape, tongue out, on the tongue.
6371640	6378640	You see what looked like hundreds of colored threads, and they're floating, they're moving, they're jumping up and down like they're alive.
6378640	6379640	Okay.
6379640	6380640	Okay.
6380640	6382640	I detect magic.
6382640	6386640	There is magic there.
6386640	6387640	Okay.
6387640	6390640	I approach the swan.
6390640	6397640	The threads rise their heads like they're snakes, and they start hissing at you.
6397640	6399640	I sense motive.
6399640	6403640	You didn't roll high enough.
6403640	6414640	I grabbed the swan by the neck.
6414640	6420640	The swan's neck starts to move around and comes alive.
6420640	6427640	I wish to find a gift.
6428640	6429640	Yes.
6429640	6430640	Yes.
6430640	6436640	I already have the perfect hat, but I think I could use maybe a nice accent like a brooch or something.
6436640	6440640	I feel like you are being too casual.
6440640	6444640	Do you know who I am?
6444640	6445640	I'm sorry.
6445640	6448640	Can we end?
6448640	6449640	The answer is no.
6449640	6450640	I understood the question.
6450640	6451640	The answer is no.
6451640	6452640	I don't know who you are.
6452640	6456640	The swan of jigadig.
6456640	6460640	Does not repeat herself.
6460640	6464640	I'll try my half snake.
6464640	6466640	I let go of her neck.
6466640	6468640	The swan of gurgadoo.
6468640	6474640	I am the swan of gurgadoo.
6474640	6477640	I push and I twain the side.
6477640	6480640	The swan of gurgadoo does not repeat herself.
6480640	6484640	I shake him out because I'm taking a knee.
6484640	6487640	The swan of gurgadoo.
6487640	6492640	That's the last time I will repeat myself.
6492640	6496640	As a rule, I don't repeat myself, but I've made some exceptions.
6496640	6499640	There will be no more made tonight.
6499640	6502640	I am the swan of gurgadoo.
6502640	6505640	I will not repeat myself again.
6505640	6508640	The swan of gurgadoo, I swear to God.
6508640	6509640	We meant no harm.
6509640	6511640	I'm sorry I grabbed your neck by mistake.
6511640	6514640	I'm a flaming orb.
6514640	6516640	Where do you shoot the orb?
6516640	6517640	At the swan of gurgadoo.
6517640	6518640	Where?
6518640	6519640	Gurgadoo!
6519640	6520640	Gurgadoo.
6520640	6521640	Where do you shoot it?
6521640	6523640	Right at the swan's open beak mouth.
6523640	6528640	Okay.
6528640	6532640	You inflict two damage on the swan of gurgadoo.
6532640	6535640	Okay.
6535640	6537640	He means no harm.
6537640	6538640	He means no harm.
6538640	6543640	I was here to help you, but now I'm here to defeat you.
6543640	6549640	It's the swan of gurgadurk's turn.
6549640	6564640	The swan of gurgadurk spits a poison egg and hits killer head in the face and inflicts four damage.
6564640	6566640	Okay.
6567640	6569640	Poison egg!
6569640	6573640	Swan of gurgadurk, I'm sorry.
6573640	6574640	We're sorry.
6574640	6576640	We mistook you for something else.
6576640	6579640	We have traveled long and hard.
6579640	6581640	We have encountered many demons and denizens.
6581640	6585640	You better be careful because you don't want to meet my master.
6585640	6589640	No, we do not.
6589640	6593640	We just want to hang out in a cave with you.
6593640	6595640	We don't want any trouble.
6595640	6597640	I had a lot of nice gifts in my beacon.
6597640	6599640	Now I will not share them with you.
6599640	6600640	That's fine.
6600640	6604640	We accept that punishment, but we have no quarrel with you, madam.
6604640	6606640	I swing my swag bag.
6606640	6608640	God damn it.
6608640	6617640	I swing my swag bag of holding and I throw a bunch of CDs that were given to me.
6617640	6622640	And I aim the CDs at swan's Achilles tendons.
6622640	6624640	All right.
6624640	6626640	It does nothing because there are CDs.
6626640	6628640	It does nothing.
6628640	6629640	Shit.
6629640	6630640	That...
6630640	6631640	That happened.
6631640	6632640	That happened.
6632640	6633640	That happened.
6633640	6635640	But nothing happened.
6635640	6637640	You've got to work on that.
6637640	6641640	I touch the swan's waterfowl cheek.
6641640	6643640	Ugh.
6645640	6647640	Yes.
6647640	6650640	Do you see me?
6650640	6653640	Like, for me?
6655640	6656640	I do.
6656640	6658640	I really do.
6658640	6664640	People always see this monstrous snake swan, but are you really looking at me?
6664640	6667640	I don't even know what you mean.
6667640	6670640	I see a beam of light when I look at you.
6674640	6676640	I see who you are.
6676640	6678640	I see your playlist.
6678640	6681640	I see your favorite color.
6681640	6684640	I see all the things that your high school friends hated.
6684640	6690640	The swan-a-durg-a-durg disappears, falls to the ground.
6690640	6699640	And what you see in front of you is a beautiful young princess holding a pearl in her hand.
6699640	6704640	She looks like Sigourney Weaver at 12.
6704640	6706640	Oh.
6706640	6708640	Thanks for qualifying that.
6708640	6710640	Thank you.
6711640	6713640	You saved me.
6713640	6715640	12 or 13?
6720640	6723640	There's a difference.
6727640	6731640	12 in swan-lady years, which is 18 in human years.
6733640	6735640	I cast Dr. Amber.
6735640	6742640	Swan-woman-lady.
6742640	6744640	I'm Durgaderg.
6744640	6746640	Durgaderg.
6746640	6748640	You saved me from this terrible spell.
6748640	6758640	I've been existing as a terrible snake swan for a very long time, only providing gifts for people that were seeking gifts for people that they didn't care about very much.
6759640	6766640	We are just here to fulfill our quest, and possibly, if it behooves you, buy you beer.
6766640	6768640	Whatever you want.
6768640	6775640	I'm afraid that the moment that I turn into a human princess is five moments before my death.
6775640	6776640	So here's my pearl.
6776640	6777640	And she dies.
6777640	6779640	She dies.
6780640	6782640	Well, we did it.
6782640	6784640	We won.
6785640	6787640	Thank you for coming to Homme des Arts.
6787640	6790640	Black on the dot, Aaron McGaughty.
6790640	6793640	What a dungeon-masterous mistress.
6793640	6795640	A dungeon-mistress.
6799640	6800640	Thank you, Aaron.
6800640	6802640	You're welcome.
6802640	6806640	Also, James Lively.
6806640	6808640	Dr. Amber.
6808640	6810640	That is Zoey Michelle.
6810640	6812640	Zoey, thank you.
6812640	6813640	I'm Jeff Davis.
6813640	6816640	Your mayor, Dan Harmon, everybody.
6818640	6820640	All right.
6820640	6825640	Thank you for giving to 826LA, and Google it, and see what you can do for them, and whatever.
6825640	6828640	Thanks for coming out in droves, and we'll see you next week.
6830640	6832640	Thank you, guys.
