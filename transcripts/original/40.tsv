0	7000	I'll see you in the next video.
7000	25000	Salt Lake City, Utah, bonsoir, how are you doing tonight, folks?
25000	29000	The snow-covered streets of Trolley Square, is that where we are?
29000	37000	And the beautifully refurbished Wise Guys Comedy Club, Harman Town is now officially in session.
37000	40000	Would you please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town.
40000	48000	You know him. You might love him. Dan Harman!
48000	56000	Salt, salt, salt, salt, take some chloride, take some sodium, salt, salt.
56000	59000	You guys love salt, right? Everyone loves salt?
59000	66000	I was like, okay, there's a guy holding a sign in the audience that says, Utah, 1922, never forget.
66000	70000	Which I think is like a deep cut reference to our podcast, right?
70000	73000	Like we were making up tragedies at one point.
73000	80000	Okay, we got another one over here. 65,000, Utah, you know what you did.
80000	85000	I don't even remember the reference now.
85000	90000	You're completely in shadow. Find your light, Harman.
90000	102000	The camera guys want me to move back a little bit so that I can make their job of capturing reality a little more artificial.
103000	111000	Sorry, my humanity wasn't marketable enough for you, Michelle Gondry.
113000	117000	You know, I would have done a show standing in a big shadow.
117000	121000	Now we'll never know what that would have been.
121000	126000	I probably would have talked to this guy. He probably has cancer or something.
126000	130000	Now I can't, I don't, everything's fucked up now.
130000	136000	But they got their shot, Jeff. They're painting with light.
136000	146000	Fucking directors. Salt Lake City is about humanity. It's not about film, you know?
146000	151000	I understand there's people here who fled Sundance to get here, right?
152000	158000	I heard about your vests, your matching vests and your beards and your Sundance vests.
158000	165000	Like, you know, Colorado, fuck Colorado, right?
165000	169000	That's where Denver is? Is that where Sundance is?
169000	171000	Where's Sundance?
171000	172000	It's in Colorado.
172000	173000	Okay.
175000	176000	It's up that canyon?
176000	177000	Oh.
178000	179000	It's in Utah.
180000	184000	Look, Utah's great. Sundance is okay.
184000	188000	Salt Lake City is the best city in the world. We know that.
188000	197000	And salt is the best condiment. Seasoning, whatever you call it.
197000	202000	I know people here, Jeff, they don't like salt being referred to as a seasoning.
202000	203000	Did you know that?
203000	204000	I did not know that.
204000	208000	They're offended by that, the way that some deaf people don't like cochlear implants.
208000	212000	You know, it's like the idea in Salt Lake City is that salt is a meal itself.
212000	219000	And that you use potatoes and steak and stuff to make the salt go down better.
219000	221000	It's a real thing here, you know?
221000	224000	This is the salt capital of the world.
224000	231000	Their roads get real icy and their potatoes get real, real, real, real, real, real bland.
231000	233000	And they eat the salt.
233000	239000	It's also the complex drinking law capital of the world.
242000	244000	Complex? Do it again?
244000	246000	It's also the what, Dan?
246000	250000	Complex drinking law corner segment.
250000	251000	All right, everybody.
251000	256000	Welcome to Utah, home of the weirdest drinking laws in the world.
256000	258000	You don't know them? You've got to memorize them.
259000	263000	We've been here for three hours and we've learned one tenth of the fucking wild ass liquor laws.
263000	265000	Complex drinking laws!
265000	267000	Let me explain them.
270000	272000	Jeff, you can't have a double here.
272000	273000	A double drink?
273000	274000	You can't have a double drink.
274000	275000	Why not?
275000	278000	There is no why, that is the because.
280000	282000	It doesn't matter why not.
282000	293000	But I'll tell you, Brigham Young, he had huge hands, and he was very, very ashamed about them.
293000	300000	He was a wood carver and a philanthropist and a brilliant man, but he had these giant hands.
300000	306000	And so they made special big glasses for him to make him feel like his hands were smaller.
306000	309000	That was the original B.Y. and B.Y.O.B., did you know that?
310000	313000	Brigham Young's own bottle.
313000	320000	The whole city had to arrange itself around Brigham Young's deformed hands.
320000	327000	And so people would wear prosthetic, giant hands.
327000	331000	That's where those foam number one hands come from.
331000	334000	Just to make him feel better, because he was a great man.
334000	337000	He founded a great city and he loved salt.
338000	343000	He ate so much salt, Jeff, that he retained water in his hands, I think.
343000	347000	Have you ever heard the expression, Matt, as a hatter?
347000	350000	That's from the lead lining in haberdasheries.
350000	352000	Mercury lining.
352000	361000	There's an expression here called, hands the size of Brigham Young.
361000	366000	So he had special giant glasses that they would get out for him.
366000	374000	If you ordered a double here in 1828, when Brigham Young was here, you could die.
374000	377000	Everyone was drinking out of extra-large glasses.
377000	380000	So that's why no doubles.
380000	381000	But it doesn't matter.
381000	383000	Today it's in honor of temperance.
383000	385000	And that's why the foam hands only hold up one finger.
385000	386000	I'll have one.
386000	389000	Yes, I'll have a single.
389000	391000	You want one drink, or do you want two?
391000	393000	I don't want two enormous Brigham Young-sized drinks.
393000	397000	We don't do doubles, said the bartender at the Marriott Hotel.
397000	400000	Something really weird about that, too.
400000	408000	When you're at a Marriott Hotel, I'm pretty sure Marriott as a hotel chain probably has more hotels
408000	412000	than there are people in certain cities in the United States.
412000	415000	As a corporation, it's practically a country.
415000	420000	And it's like, I don't know what's ironic about that, but something is.
421000	423000	You work at a Marriott.
423000	425000	Give me the Marriott goods.
425000	430000	If Utah said I couldn't sleep in a bed, would there be no beds in the Marriott?
430000	433000	What's in charge here?
433000	436000	Does the money walk or the bullshit talk?
436000	440000	I walked into the bar at the Marriott, and a nice young lady said,
440000	442000	Sir, I need to scan your ID.
442000	443000	I'm like, OK.
443000	446000	I've never seen that, ever.
446000	451000	And she took it, and then she wrote down every bit of information off of my ID.
451000	454000	And then she put it in a thing, and it came out, it was shredded, and then she said,
454000	457000	Go fuck yourself.
457000	459000	I thought that was a crazy lady thing.
459000	461000	Is that a Utah thing, or is that a crazy lady thing?
461000	463000	That's a Utah thing?
463000	465000	Maybe crazy ladies are a Utah thing.
465000	468000	Like, lithium's a salt, right?
468000	470000	It's all coming together.
470000	473000	But also, we were just told that you're not allowed to, in this restaurant,
473000	475000	you're not allowed to be walking around with your drink.
475000	478000	You have to be seated and eating chicken wings to have it.
478000	481000	We broke the law coming up here.
481000	484000	We called 911 before we came up.
484000	486000	We had to somehow get it.
486000	487000	That's right.
487000	491000	You'll notice there's an elaborate trolley system along the walls,
491000	493000	like in Mr. Rogers' house.
493000	497000	Because the wait staff is not allowed to walk while holding liquor.
497000	500000	So there's a little choo-choo train that comes by.
500000	504000	And they have to technically, they have to pretend that they're here to catch a train.
504000	506000	And then they go, oh, I'm holding a beer.
506000	508000	And then they go, I think this is yours.
508000	510000	And they have to go through so much.
510000	512000	And they have to wash their hands, too, on top of it all.
512000	515000	The only way to get around it is to be in a wheelchair
515000	517000	and have a plate of food in your lap.
517000	519000	And then you can cruise around with a drink.
519000	521000	It's complicated here.
521000	524000	Are there some other liquor laws that we don't know about?
524000	526000	There's a lot.
526000	527000	They work in a bar.
527000	528000	What's your name, sir?
528000	529000	He's Deuce.
529000	531000	Okay, let's bring Deuce up because of his awesome name
531000	535000	and his expertise and his...
535000	536000	Hello, Deuce.
536000	539000	Deuce is wearing a Crisis Alert t-shirt from Community.
539000	540000	Yeah, I am.
540000	541000	Awesome.
541000	547000	So Deuce, you work in the liquor industry here in the city
547000	549000	that invented complicated liquor laws.
549000	552000	So let's run down some of the more weird...
552000	555000	Okay, so like this, this is considered a restaurant.
555000	558000	So you have to have food to get a beverage.
558000	561000	If you are, you can get beverage by itself.
561000	564000	You can't have a double, but you can have two different kinds
564000	566000	of liquor in front of you.
566000	568000	So you can order a tequila and a rum.
568000	569000	That's fine, but not two rums.
569000	570000	Can I order two tequilas?
570000	571000	No, I can't.
571000	573000	No, but you can get tequila and a rum.
573000	576000	Because they saw five easy pieces and they're like,
576000	579000	okay, we're not going to let a Jack Nicholson figure go.
579000	581000	I'd like to give me two tequilas then.
581000	582000	Ooh, look what I'm doing.
582000	583000	They figured that out.
583000	585000	You can hold the ice between your knees.
585000	586000	Yeah.
586000	590000	Okay, so if I have food in a restaurant, can I have a double?
590000	592000	No, no, I still can't.
592000	593000	I can never have a double, ever.
593000	595000	You can never have a double unless you're at home.
595000	598000	But I was at Subway at a Utah gas station
598000	600000	and I got double meat on my...
600000	605000	That's a stupid comment.
605000	607000	All right, well, give us another one.
607000	612000	Let's see, you can only have two ounces of liquor in a drink.
612000	613000	Right.
613000	614000	Even if it's like a Long Island,
614000	616000	which has all kinds of different liquors,
616000	618000	you can still only have two ounces worth of alcohol.
618000	619000	Oh, total?
619000	620000	Total.
620000	622000	Oh, so if you order a Long Island iced tea and you...
622000	623000	It's bullshit.
623000	626000	Yeah, does it come in a Dixie cup?
626000	627000	Usually, yeah.
627000	629000	It comes in plastic here.
629000	630000	All right, well, let me...
630000	633000	Maybe instead of just asking to list the stuff off,
633000	635000	here, let's just do an exercise.
635000	638000	You be a bartender, I'll be a customer.
638000	641000	Oh, what a rough day of being an American citizen
641000	644000	that's supposedly allowed to do whatever the fuck I want to do
644000	647000	and having to put up with an ownership class of rich people
647000	652000	that have 1% of whatever, the 99% of ThingFlamFlam.
652000	653000	I'm so stressed out.
653000	657000	I would like to numb my brain with a legal substance
657000	660000	that makes everyone around me smarter for a couple hours,
660000	663000	a couple blessed fucking hours.
663000	668000	Can I please have a kettle one on the rocks with no lime?
669000	672000	Okay, so the answer is yes, but then...
672000	673000	Yes, sir.
673000	675000	Then you fill the glass with ice and you fill it up.
675000	677000	It's a thimbleful.
677000	678000	It's one ounce of...
678000	680000	Okay, so I get it and I go,
680000	685000	okay, I'm going to slide this $5 bill across the table.
685000	686000	Oh, oh, oh, my.
686000	687000	Hey, can I...
687000	691000	Why don't you make it a double if we're going to be this way?
691000	695000	Then I'd look around, see if the D.A.B.C. was in the house.
695000	697000	Is he a rapper?
697000	698000	Yeah.
698000	701000	No, that's the beverage council or whatever.
701000	704000	Yeah, Department of Alcohol Beverage.
704000	708000	Yeah, it's ridiculous because they actually send spies in a lot to us.
708000	710000	Right, secret drinkers.
710000	712000	Yeah, they really do, they really do.
712000	714000	Lots of underage kids being like,
714000	717000	come on, man, here's 20 bucks, let me in the bar.
717000	718000	Right, well, that's everywhere.
718000	720000	And then does an Irish guy walk in and go,
720000	723000	ah, we're shutting you down, deuce.
723000	724000	Oh, my God.
724000	725000	We're shutting you down.
725000	728000	Jesus Christ, Jeff, you know who would hate it in Salt Lake City?
728000	729000	Fucking Jerry McSeinfeld.
729000	731000	Jerry McSeinfeld.
731000	733000	Oh.
733000	735000	Stay here, dude, stay here.
735000	738000	Oh, I'm Jerry McSeinfeld.
738000	740000	I'm an Irish Jerry Seinfeld.
740000	745000	I'm famous for me observational material and the Irish heritage.
745000	751000	So you can imagine I'm quite puzzled by the state of affairs in your little burg.
751000	753000	Why can't I have a double?
753000	754000	We've been over that.
754000	756000	I'm Jerry McSeinfeld.
756000	760000	Why is it so snowy outside?
760000	763000	And why, in such an inhospitable climate,
763000	766000	would you want to make it even harder to drink?
766000	768000	What's happening?
768000	772000	Why do you want people to move away so bad?
772000	776000	Is that why you're always closing all the roads so we can't escape?
776000	778000	Aye, sir, that's the exact thing.
778000	779000	Oh, my God.
779000	783000	It's Irish Tim Allen.
783000	785000	It's Irish Tim Allen.
785000	789000	Oh, to-to-to-ho-ho-ho.
789000	792000	Irish Tim Allen, what did you do today?
792000	795000	We went on tool time, sir.
795000	799000	He talked to me neighbor Wilson.
799000	802000	He's a little Scottish.
802000	805000	Irish Tim Allen is a pirate.
805000	809000	Don't judge Salt Lake City.
809000	812000	You live on a Salt Lake.
812000	814000	Why is it a Salt Lake?
814000	816000	Why would you want to put salt in a lake?
816000	818000	The worst place for it.
818000	821000	Oh, sir, I fixed that with me tool time supplies.
821000	824000	Oh, I'm Irish Tim Allen.
824000	827000	And he's Irish Tim Allen.
827000	829000	All right, thank you, Deuce.
829000	831000	Deuce, everybody.
835000	839000	I thought that Irish Tim Allen would have a lot more material here in Salt Lake City,
839000	841000	but he actually doesn't.
842000	846000	This is the city that puts me and Irish Seinfeld on the same page.
846000	849000	And everybody, because he's like, oh, why can't you have a double?
849000	850000	That's it.
850000	851000	Why can't you have a double?
851000	854000	Just put a billboard outside as you enter the-
854000	856000	is that a statewide thing or a city thing?
856000	857000	Statewide.
857000	858000	Statewide.
858000	859000	Okay, so as you cross the border into Utah,
859000	862000	just put up a big billboard that says,
862000	864000	not you can't have a double.
864000	867000	Say, why can't you have a double?
867000	872000	And then the answer underneath it will say,
872000	874000	because we love you.
874000	877000	And then have like a black lady with a baby.
877000	879000	Something to make it.
879000	884000	Is there anybody here that's from Utah that still manages to get drunk occasionally?
884000	886000	Is there anybody here that's a drinker?
886000	889000	Does it keep you from getting drunk?
889000	893000	I imagine, Jeff, that the alcoholism is rampant here.
893000	901000	Among the youth, I saw S.L.C. Punk with Shaggy.
901000	904000	When I was like, I don't know, 16, 15-
904000	906000	I think I was like 15 years old in high school.
906000	910000	We came up to Utah from Southern California to- on a ski trip.
910000	914000	That's why we went to like Park City and Snowbird or whatever the hell you got up here.
914000	916000	Alta or Alta, whatever.
916000	917000	Yeah, it was great.
917000	919000	Best to know in the world.
919000	923000	And we had no booze. We were all 16, 15-year-olds.
923000	925000	And I was kind of like a huckster.
925000	928000	I was like a shoplifter and a bad person and a burglarizer and stuff.
928000	932000	And so I was commissioned to go out and get the alcohol.
932000	936000	So I went to a hotel and there was a really cool like little liquor store in the lobby of a hotel.
936000	938000	But it was just like liquor.
938000	939000	Like no beers, no nothing.
939000	942000	It was just like a really old time like Raymond Chandler novel kind of thing.
942000	945000	Like an old hotel with a booze department in it.
945000	949000	And they probably had like a house dick walking around, you know, like busting people.
949000	953000	And I went to the guy and I was skinny, a little 15-year-old.
953000	958000	I was like, hey, my dad's having a big party with a bunch of his asshole friends up in the room.
958000	960000	And they're too drunk to come down.
960000	962000	He told- he sent me down to buy the stuff.
962000	963000	Here's his list.
963000	965000	And I just put this piece of paper in front of him.
965000	967000	He's like, oh, wow, that's clever thinking of him.
967000	972000	So I just bought like just bags and bags and bags and bags of booze.
972000	974000	And his response was, well, that's a good idea.
974000	975000	That's a good idea of your father.
975000	976000	I never thought of sending the kid down.
976000	977000	What a good idea.
977000	978000	It's good, yeah.
978000	979000	A human shield.
979000	980000	I came back.
980000	984000	I was like Alexander the Great when I came back around.
984000	987000	Trump was like, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.
987000	989000	That's a lot of booze.
989000	994000	The waiter, Marcus, came over to Deuce and started whispering something to him.
994000	999000	And I thought the SWAT team was going to come in and stop talking to them about the liquor laws.
1000000	1004000	By the way, I filled up a glass of Grey Goose up here.
1004000	1007000	I'd say, is this like a sword swallowing act to you guys?
1009000	1012000	Am I like Mel Gibson and Beyond Thunderdome with the kids?
1012000	1016000	It's like, oh, the pocket clip, fly, fly, pilot, man.
1016000	1019000	He has a full glass of liquor in his hand.
1019000	1020000	All right.
1020000	1021000	I'm not me.
1021000	1022000	It's not you guys.
1022000	1025000	It's the fucking government.
1025000	1031000	And by government, we mean the ghosts of weird, it's got to be like some guy in the 1800s was like,
1031000	1037000	well, they can't have doubles because every time I have a double, I know I want to rape people
1037000	1042000	because I'm a vile person that makes laws and I make them because I ask myself,
1042000	1046000	what would I like to do today if I could do anything I wanted to do?
1046000	1054000	Well, I'd eat that little girl and I'd own those black people and I'd hit them when they did something wrong
1054000	1060000	and I'd clobber my wife over the head with a shovel and like bury her in the backyard.
1060000	1065000	We got to start like making laws against this stuff because they're making the mistake of going,
1065000	1069000	oh, everyone's a vile old prick in the world.
1069000	1071000	And it's just that's the problem.
1071000	1074000	That's why we have to figure out, Jeff, the Constitution for harm in town.
1074000	1077000	And it has to be like a little piece of code.
1077000	1081000	It has to just be a very simple kind of figure it out before we get back to L.A.
1081000	1083000	I think it's do what you want.
1083000	1084000	It is do what you want.
1084000	1085000	Everyone gets to do what they want.
1085000	1087000	But you got to say it like that.
1087000	1092000	You got to say this to Jeremy Cramer as well, but do what you want.
1092000	1093000	It's like the mafia.
1093000	1098000	Everyone gets to do whatever they want unless it interferes with someone else's ability to do whatever they want.
1098000	1102000	Dot, dot, dot, question mark.
1102000	1103000	I don't know what to put in there.
1103000	1104000	I don't know.
1104000	1109000	And if two people both want to do something and they can't both do it without one of them having to do something they don't want
1109000	1111000	or not getting to do whatever they want,
1111000	1116000	then you engage in a ritual called patty cake.
1116000	1122000	Well, I think back in the old days, manners were, there was a high premium on courtesy.
1122000	1128000	People opened doors for each other and people helped old ladies across the street and put cloaks over puddles and stuff like that.
1128000	1129000	I don't know if they really did.
1129000	1130000	That might just be in a book.
1130000	1133000	But maybe they just had more cloaks back then.
1133000	1134000	They didn't care as much.
1134000	1139000	But now, I guess, we have evolved technologically and we evolve as a species.
1139000	1142000	Courtesy seems just to be something that's just dying.
1142000	1144000	It's like devolving.
1144000	1148000	The whole thing comes down to, yeah, I want to do this, but I want to smoke a cigarette.
1148000	1149000	But these people might not want it.
1149000	1152000	And someone walks over and politely goes, hey, man, can you not smoke a cigarette?
1152000	1153000	You know, I'm sorry.
1153000	1155000	I'll take it outside.
1155000	1158000	Or maybe, like, have a human conversation about it.
1158000	1159000	Be adults.
1159000	1161000	Have some common courtesy, is my thing.
1161000	1162000	Yeah.
1162000	1166000	But then there's this rise of the passive aggressive mutant.
1166000	1171000	Somebody who's cool but is always getting what they want, leveraging people socially.
1171000	1172000	You have to protect against...
1172000	1174000	Yeah, but then you tell that person you're being a dick.
1174000	1175000	Shut up.
1175000	1179000	Well, then that person can also say you're being a dick for not giving up.
1179000	1182000	There needs to be a little bit of a foolproof.
1182000	1185000	I understand the whole idea is be cool.
1185000	1187000	But it's kind of...
1187000	1189000	Here's my theory.
1189000	1195560	There's got to be a way to back the dollar with human life instead of, like, a mythical
1195560	1202000	piece of gold in Fort Knox or a stock or the dollar itself or pride in your country.
1202000	1206620	If you were able to back the nation's currency, like, because currency is going to be useful
1206620	1207700	still for a little while.
1207700	1211000	We can't all become hippies and run around and kiss gazelle or something.
1211000	1214740	Like, we've got a good hundred years left of still needing poker chips to get through
1214740	1217160	our day, like, to make transactions.
1217160	1221280	I say, though, you can back that currency with, like, it's like a video game.
1221280	1225080	Like, when you're playing a video game, there are video games where you're, like, walking
1225080	1228200	down the street and then there's, like, a thing that goes, someone needs help and then
1228200	1230400	you go and help them and then you get some bonus points.
1230400	1233040	And they're actual points that you can use to get a bigger gun and blow the fuck out
1233040	1235440	of something.
1235440	1240340	It's, like, shit that you can use to make yourself cooler, at the very least when you
1240340	1241340	show up.
1241340	1242840	Because I've discussed this before.
1242840	1246520	I was just saying, like, if I'm walking down the street and there's a guy laying on the
1246520	1250280	sidewalk in a puddle of his own piss and he's going, like, I had a bad day today.
1250280	1251280	Can you help me out?
1251280	1255800	My reason for not stopping and having a conversation with him and seeing how I can help him is I'm
1255800	1256800	late for lunch.
1256800	1257800	I got shit to do.
1257800	1258800	I got a script to finish.
1258800	1261040	I got all this stuff to do.
1261040	1265080	And the reason I got to finish my script or be on time to lunch with my friend, all that
1265080	1267200	stuff just has to do with capitalism, really.
1267200	1272440	It just has to do with, like, okay, I'll end up like him if I help him.
1272440	1274960	I'll end up like him if I help him.
1274960	1281360	So all you have to do is reverse that and say, if I help him, the opposite.
1281360	1284840	So that when we see a guy laying in the middle of the sidewalk in a puddle of his own piss,
1284840	1287480	we go, holy shit, I can't believe I found one.
1287480	1290360	Like, this is, like, a hidden package in Grand Theft Auto.
1290360	1294040	Like, I just stumble, do you know how rare these are?
1294040	1297200	People who need my help, I'm rich.
1297200	1302240	And because if I help him, then it's, like, I get, like, points, I get, like, a powerup
1302240	1304620	of some kind.
1304620	1309020	And then because the whole country works that way, we're the most powerful country in the
1309020	1312780	world, because all the other countries go, like, oh, that country where everybody's,
1312780	1317580	fuck, nobody's laying on the sidewalk in their own piss, they're all, they all, they all
1317580	1322380	just, every time someone starts to have a bad day, eight people jump on him and help
1322380	1325180	him so that they can profit off of it karmically.
1325180	1328860	And so everyone lives in a fucking, like, penthouse over there, everyone's, like, floating
1328860	1329860	around and...
1329860	1332300	But you're talking about destroying capital.
1332300	1337460	So then now, like, so if you replace helping people with capital, like, the whole point
1337460	1340460	is that we've got to a place where capital is the whole point.
1340460	1343540	Accumulation of wealth is the definition of success.
1343540	1346500	Competition is a good thing, you know, getting ahead of other people.
1346500	1352480	Yeah, but, but, like, a couple thousand years ago, the definition of poor was, you know,
1352480	1357660	you lived until 25 if someone didn't come into your house, stab you in the face and
1357660	1359180	fuck the stab hole.
1359180	1362940	Like, that's not what it means to be poor anymore.
1362940	1367340	Now being poor means you eat a Big Mac out of a dumpster and you have a coat that someone
1367340	1368340	gave you.
1368340	1370780	Like, like, like, you're still, you're still walking around without a house and you get
1370780	1372780	fucking cold and you die sooner.
1372780	1379180	But like, like, like the poverty, the definition of, of, of the 99%, like, like, keeps going
1379180	1380180	up.
1380180	1382780	We can, we can increase that by a thousand fold.
1382780	1383780	That's my theory.
1383780	1388340	I'm no economics professor, but I don't think that capitalism necessarily, yes, it means
1388340	1392060	that, that, that there's, like, a pyramid in place and that there's a competition in
1392060	1393060	place.
1393060	1399660	But, but why can't the poorest person in the world have, like, a giant TV and get to play
1399660	1400660	video games?
1400660	1404180	Oh, it could, but it profits, it profits none, you know, enough food goes to waste every
1404180	1405180	day to feed almost everybody.
1405180	1408880	And, you know, there's certainly enough housing and clothing for everybody, but prices have
1408880	1409880	to be at a certain place.
1409880	1414660	We have to make sure that rich, white, gross people control shit.
1414660	1416260	They don't, they don't, they don't have to be.
1416260	1420980	It's just that that's been the easy way to do it, you know, and it's all kind of fallen
1420980	1421980	apart anyway.
1421980	1426740	Like, like, rich people, like, there's a, there's a shorter path to, like, you know,
1426740	1431460	keeping poor people poor, like, that's the, that's what makes sense to a rich person.
1431460	1435860	But like, if you challenge them, they tend to figure new shit out.
1435860	1438460	The thing that, the thing that bums me out is, like, a room like this, there's no government
1438460	1439460	in here.
1439460	1443140	This, this is, this is the proper definition of anarchism, meaning there's nobody ruling
1443140	1444140	anybody here.
1444140	1449620	I stood up and was like, Jesus Christ, I'm gonna shit on my hand and throw it at you.
1449620	1454460	No cop can help me, like, like, that guy, that guy becomes in charge.
1454460	1463460	He's Bane now, he's, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm headlining in words, guys, like, I'm the new Kevin Neelan.
1463460	1467740	There's a lot of Kevin Neelan pictures of the wall here, it's like, Kevin, Kevin Neelan
1467740	1468740	is there.
1468740	1470940	Is, is Kevin Neelan a part owner here?
1470940	1474540	Did Kevin Neelan, like, resuscitate a dying pregnant woman here?
1474540	1478980	Is he, like, in the middle of his act and, like, a woman was like, I'm six months pregnant
1478980	1483660	and choking on a hot wing, and he's like, excuse me, and, like, just brought her back
1483660	1487140	to life and gave her a thousand dollars and, and then, and then closed.
1487140	1490260	Kevin, Kevin, before you go, how can, how can we repay you?
1490260	1491260	Your thanks is enough.
1491260	1493180	No, how can we repay you?
1493180	1496100	Put up 400 photos of me on the wall.
1496100	1502420	Create a system of laws in my name that make it hard to drink.
1502420	1504180	I am the Neelan.
1504180	1510300	He's like the Stargate guy, like, he'll come back every once in a while and suppress literacy.
1510300	1511780	But he gets worshipped here.
1511780	1516240	Anyways, like, if that, yeah, that guy, if a guy stood up and, like, fucking tried to
1516240	1520700	choke me to death, you would be the people that helped me.
1520700	1523980	You, you would, you would save me, possibly.
1523980	1524980	And vice versa.
1525220	1526740	Like, like, we have wait staff here.
1526740	1528700	We have, maybe, maybe we have a bouncer here.
1528700	1533420	We have, you know, we, these are all, these are all private, anarchic roles.
1533420	1537100	Like, like, like, we put, like, you, you need a bouncer and you need a white person
1537100	1540300	and you need, you need a club owner and you need a performer and you need an audience.
1540300	1542180	And then we, we're, we're not animals.
1542180	1544500	We know how to fucking behave ourselves.
1544500	1548860	We don't need a fucking senator to tell us, like, like, what left from right is.
1548860	1552420	But those are the only people that don't ever do anything.
1552420	1554260	It just, it fucking confounds me.
1554260	1558340	How we've, like, we've created a new society where we, it's, you know how, like,
1558340	1563380	like, like, bees, like, they, they, they, they, they, they raise their own royalty.
1563380	1564940	They could, they're just sitting there as larvae.
1564940	1566660	You could fucking eat them.
1566660	1570860	Like, like, and then these queens hatch and then they sting the other queens to death
1570860	1573860	and then they take over and these, these poor soldiers are just like, oh,
1573860	1575540	thank God we have a queen again.
1575540	1579700	Like, we, I understand the, the desire for comfort and leadership, but we, in,
1579700	1583940	in America, the idea of that was that we, those people are civil servants.
1583940	1586220	It's like, here, you're not wearing a crown.
1586220	1587700	You're wearing a clip on tie.
1587700	1589620	Get to work, motherfucker.
1589620	1592060	So, I can go do the shit I enjoy.
1592060	1593340	I want to be a radio DJ.
1593340	1594260	I want to be a dentist.
1594260	1597540	I want to, I want to dig a ditch and, and then, like, punch a clock and,
1597540	1601780	and not worry about shit from 8 p.m. to, to, to 6 a.m.
1601780	1604100	Some, some people might prefer doing that shit.
1604100	1607460	None of us want to balance the budget and make the garbage trucks run on time.
1607460	1609740	That's why we elect officials.
1609740	1614340	The president is supposed to be a top of the line fucking dipshit civil servant.
1614340	1618660	He's not supposed to be someone that we, that we cower in the presence of.
1618660	1623180	And, and, and, and most importantly that people like literally murder and cheat
1623180	1627220	and lie and steal to try to become, because they have the most power in the world.
1627220	1629860	It, it got, and, and all these fucking lawmakers.
1629860	1630740	All right, anyway, sorry.
1630740	1634380	Let's do a Fart Corner!
1634380	1638460	Fart Corner, Fart Corner, hold on, I got to queue up the music.
1638460	1640740	Fart Corner offsets the political rants.
1640740	1643020	Fart Corner is the place where a diggity dance.
1643020	1646180	Fart Corner's going to make it real.
1646180	1646860	Fart.
1646860	1649340	All right, it's that time again.
1649340	1650060	Fart Corner.
1650060	1650780	Fart Corner?
1650780	1651260	Fart.
1651260	1652620	Fart Corner.
1652620	1657300	Get ready to get farted on by your favorite firter, Ted Harmon.
1657300	1658260	What's your name?
1658260	1659260	Dude.
1663660	1664460	What's your name?
1664460	1665180	Colton.
1665180	1665980	No, it's not.
1668460	1669580	Woo!
1669580	1673220	Fart Corner!
1673220	1676940	Sorry about the armchair politics.
1676940	1680140	But when we go to the moon, I swear to God, like the first, the first,
1680140	1683900	when we go to the moon, the first person I catch talking about me like I'm in
1683900	1685740	charge gets shot.
1685740	1686820	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
1686820	1690060	OK, I overreacted, I overreacted.
1690060	1693980	Set the guy not in charge.
1693980	1697220	All right, we have to, it's complicated, it's complicated.
1697220	1698180	We have to work it out.
1698180	1701580	But I knew that Salt Lake City was the place to talk about this,
1701580	1708220	because they're living in a, they come face to face with the absurd hypocrisy
1708220	1708820	every day.
1708820	1713700	They live in a lake made of salt.
1713700	1715100	Are you guys proud of living here?
1715100	1717380	Is this a place that people take pride in living in?
1720620	1722100	Well, who would say no?
1722100	1724340	It wasn't measured.
1724340	1725700	Deuce is shaking his head, no.
1725700	1726740	Some people are like, yeah.
1726740	1728220	But there's an elitist effect, too.
1728220	1730780	You could ask that in Brooklyn.
1730780	1734900	OK, like towns that aren't New York or LA,
1734900	1738260	we have this kind of elitist training, too, to go like, oh,
1738260	1741660	I live in Denver, but I'm sorry, I burped.
1741660	1743300	I live in Denver, but I don't like it.
1743300	1746020	Can I leave with you?
1746020	1748460	There's places, and it's self-hatred.
1748460	1753100	I've been here a bunch of times, and I don't know anything really about this town.
1753100	1756700	Last night, I don't think we really got to meet the true Denver.
1757660	1759300	We leave right after the show.
1759300	1762020	We have a couple drinks, and we get on the bus, and we go to Portland.
1762020	1765580	Well, you know Utah, I mean, there's no better way to get to know a community
1765580	1770220	that you're in, Jeff, than familiarizing yourself with its active sports community.
1771340	1773220	Yeah? Well, you love sports.
1773220	1775180	Yeah. Yeah.
1775180	1777420	It's that time again.
1778420	1781500	Sports corner!
1781500	1783700	Hey, everybody, it's a lot like Fart Corner.
1783700	1785580	It's a lot like Fart Corner,
1785580	1788060	but less people get farted on.
1788060	1790620	He's going to fart on your favorite sports teams, Dan Harmon.
1790620	1791580	Sports corner.
1791580	1793340	Sports corner, Utah.
1793340	1797700	All right, Dan, you've been pretty vocal in the past about the Jazz.
1797700	1799940	Yeah. What's your problem with this team?
1799940	1801180	Why do you come down so hard on them?
1801180	1804380	Jeff, defense. This is a game about defense.
1804380	1807900	The Jazz needs to understand that if you're not protecting the ball,
1807900	1810020	you're actively attacking it for the other team.
1812100	1813780	And that is a simple thing.
1813780	1817060	Our moms told us that when we would play the Jazz's game.
1817060	1821020	Dan, do you think, I mean, he's a little older.
1821020	1822500	He's still putting the numbers up.
1822500	1824580	Do you think it was wise to re-sign Carl Malone?
1824580	1826500	I think Carl...
1826500	1830820	I think Carl Malone is a legend, but he's a functional legend.
1830820	1832820	Like, there's legends and then there's fossils.
1832820	1835020	So you look at Kubrick, you look at...
1837060	1840420	You look at Hitchens on the Nuggets, you look at, I don't know,
1840420	1843740	Tiger Woods out there in the seventh inning of the last Clippers game.
1844740	1850020	Like, Malone is different from Woods, different from Kubrick,
1850020	1853940	different from Hitchens, in that he is a functional legend.
1853940	1855140	He still has value.
1855140	1856820	Most importantly, leadership.
1856820	1859060	The other Jazz?
1859060	1862740	Yeah. The other Jazz's are going to look at Malone
1862740	1866540	and they're going to remember what it's like to be proud of the Jazz's.
1866540	1867700	All right.
1868900	1871980	Listen, it's a game about spirit and mind.
1872100	1874460	Like, I don't know what people think moved that ball
1874460	1879540	from left to right out there, but it's not just yardage.
1879540	1884940	It's handicaps, it's icing the knee, it's taking things quarter by quarter
1884940	1888180	and it's leadership, it's belief in that your team can do it
1888180	1890060	and Malone brings that to the Jazz.
1890060	1891180	All right.
1891180	1893260	Frankly, that's what the Jazz has been missing.
1893260	1896780	I'm not going to win any popularity contest saying this, but...
1896780	1899660	But Malone belongs on that team and Hitler was right.
1902820	1906100	Sports Corner, brought to you by Nabisco.
1906100	1907940	Nabisco. Sports Corner.
1907940	1910220	Yeah, Sports Corner, Sports Corner.
1910220	1912620	Secret racist agenda in Sports Corner.
1912620	1913940	Don't know if you caught it.
1913940	1918740	Sports Corner, stuck in a pro Nazi message at the end.
1920500	1921500	It's just that simple.
1921500	1923820	Sometimes you catch it, sometimes you don't.
1923820	1927380	I mean, some of your racist agenda is more subtle than other times.
1927380	1929540	Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's him, you just said Hitler was right.
1929540	1933620	He got caught, you know, Jimmy the Greek, he got caught.
1933620	1935460	I'm very cool about it.
1935460	1936580	I'll slip it in.
1936580	1937580	Yeah.
1937580	1941100	Like, I give a boom goes to the dynamite, Hitler was right.
1941100	1942100	OK.
1943540	1944860	What do you think Hitler did right?
1944860	1946260	I mean, I mean, top ten...
1946260	1947300	Yardage. Yardage.
1947300	1948780	Mostly yardage.
1948780	1952620	I mean, yeah, I mean, he really put up a yardage against Poland in 1939.
1954020	1955740	He was first in completions, Jesse.
1955740	1957220	Always be attacking, yeah.
1959540	1964540	Yeah.
1964540	1971020	This is going to end up out of context on Huffington Post's RTMZ.
1971020	1974860	And the word Chevy Chase is going to get mentioned seven times.
1974860	1978140	Oh, well, that's life in the tag cloud.
1978140	1979860	It's a tag cloud society now, Jeff.
1979860	1980660	It really is.
1980660	1983020	Got to keep that ball moving.
1983020	1985620	You know, I feel like there's been one good thing,
1985620	1988340	and there's been many good things about this Harman tour that we've been doing.
1988340	1991540	But speaking of the Internet and the benefits that it has,
1991540	1994900	I think if we do one thing in this tour is that we've released into the ether
1994900	1997980	and into the ethos of the country and possibly the world
1997980	1999620	a gentleman named Spencer Crittenden.
1999620	2000620	Oh, yeah.
2003380	2005500	Spencer, Spencer to the stage.
2008220	2009700	Spencer, are you with us?
2009700	2011140	Spencer Crittenden, everybody.
2011140	2022540	Oh, approaching the table, wearing his vintage community shirt.
2022540	2027780	He sets down his bag with an earth shattering thud.
2027780	2032580	The mics are hot, but the crowd is hotter.
2032580	2036020	His beard contains secrets and scrambled eggs.
2039020	2040500	He's a better rapper.
2041340	2043860	Spencer did a rap debut last night in Denver.
2043860	2046980	Yeah, it hasn't podcast yet, so we're letting you know Spencer has emerged
2046980	2049900	as the master rapper of the tour bus.
2049900	2052780	I don't feel like that the battle has really reached its fever pitch, though.
2052780	2054140	No, no, no. Someone's going to die.
2054140	2055460	I think that was the first.
2055460	2057700	That was the opening clean clang of a sword fight.
2057700	2061780	We haven't really got up the staircase and swiped the candles and have it.
2061780	2065660	Can we talk about Gobbler's Knob a little bit?
2065660	2069340	I was laying in my bunk in the tour bus and we were about 45 minutes out
2069340	2071700	from Salt Lake City, and I'm looking on the map where we are.
2071700	2074340	And I noticed a little town way out.
2074580	2077020	I don't even know if any roads connected to the highway we were on.
2077260	2078140	Well, it's just a knob.
2078140	2079900	I don't even know if it's a town.
2079900	2085260	There is a place on a map known as Gobbler's Knob, which I think that's
2085260	2087660	what I would call a town if you let me name towns.
2088660	2091220	Has anybody been to Gobbler's Knob?
2091220	2093860	Really? It's not that it's anybody heard of Gobbler's Knob?
2094740	2096500	Yeah, yeah. Pull it up on the map.
2096500	2097660	We should all go after the show.
2097660	2100020	We should all go to Gobbler's Knob.
2100020	2101460	They changed the name, though.
2101460	2102780	It used to be really embarrassing.
2102780	2108380	Like it was like a was it just just a penis dick cock swallow valley?
2109620	2111260	And then they had a boner huffer.
2111260	2114020	Yeah, Gobbler's Knob.
2114300	2115820	I love that it's not Knob Gobblers.
2115820	2116940	It's Gobbler's Knob.
2116940	2119460	Hi, I'm Karl Gobbler.
2119460	2124300	There's a knob where you can have a nice glass of lemonade with me, Karl Gobbler.
2125220	2127140	Why isn't there a band called Gobbler's Knob?
2127140	2128420	It's so good.
2128420	2130020	Gobbler's Knob.
2130020	2130980	Gobbler's Knob.
2130980	2134740	You know, every everything in Gobbler's Knob like like is very, very serious.
2134740	2137140	You know that they have to be very serious there.
2137140	2140260	If there's people that live there, you know, they're like experts in keeping it cool.
2140260	2144820	And like like there's like eight libraries every block, like like,
2144820	2146660	because they're like, we live in Gobbler's Knob.
2146660	2148780	So like like somebody fucking compensate here.
2150100	2152740	Dan said earlier, they probably have a really good Holocaust museum there.
2154420	2156140	Yeah, anything serious.
2156140	2162700	Like they're experts in the serious, like it's all to offset.
2162700	2164780	You know, there's a there's a sign as you go into Gobbler's Knob.
2164780	2166700	It says, welcome to Gobbler's Knob.
2166700	2168740	This is a serious place.
2168740	2170700	This is for real.
2170700	2173140	Did you didn't come here to make fun of us?
2173140	2176260	Did you? Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.
2176260	2179180	You want a T-shirt. We get it.
2179180	2182460	If they had any brains, there's a big sign that says welcome to Gobbler's Knob.
2182460	2184180	And there's a gift shop right there.
2184180	2186020	Yeah, yeah. Get your T-shirts.
2186060	2187340	It's just a turkey stuck in a dick.
2187340	2193860	When I was there was a guy in there was a guy in Milwaukee.
2194380	2196540	I just want a T-shirt with a turkey stuck in a dick.
2198340	2200380	I'm from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and there's a
2202020	2205900	there was a war hero there from there that fought in World War Two, I think.
2205900	2210260	And and he had parks named after him and some streets named after him.
2210260	2211940	And his last name was Bong.
2211940	2215340	And and there was a Bong rec area like a
2216460	2221020	and and it was the sign was like cold riveted.
2221460	2225300	Like there was it would say Bong rec area is this little sign
2225300	2228460	that was just like any any ordinary sign or anything else.
2228460	2231020	But it was like fucking eight bolts per centimeter.
2233260	2235540	Like razor wire going up to it.
2235540	2237940	Giant chisel marks in the side of it.
2237940	2242580	And they actually I saw an interview with his granddaughter or something
2243060	2247780	who's still a Milwaukee kind of socialite or philanthropist or something.
2247780	2249940	And the Bong name lives on in Milwaukee.
2250940	2253660	The journalist had to just be doing it as a as a bit.
2253660	2257220	It was like this interview with this woman that was like she she was just
2257300	2263300	she just didn't understand why why is it the most stolen sign in all of Wisconsin?
2263660	2267340	Why why do people keep stealing the Bong rec area sign?
2268220	2270140	I don't he was he was a war hero.
2270140	2271620	He tried to do good with his life.
2271620	2275180	But I don't know if they're I don't know if they're being disrespectful
2275180	2276940	or if they just appreciate history.
2279940	2283260	It's because it's it looks perfect in your basement.
2285140	2289100	That's because there will never be enough Bong rec areas to put that sign up.
2289580	2293780	Spencer, I saw on the Instagrams that you and Aaron made snow angels
2293780	2295140	and you did it in your shorts.
2295140	2296940	Oh, yeah, totally.
2296940	2298340	Did you bring pants?
2298340	2300660	I brought one pair of jeans.
2300660	2301780	Are they magic jeans?
2301780	2303220	Do they have one use?
2303220	2304620	Are you saving them for something?
2304620	2306900	Oh, yeah, they recharge every couple of days.
2306900	2309060	So I've been cycling them.
2309060	2312060	Is it for you like like when people tell me to tie my shoe,
2312060	2314460	like people telling you to not wear shorts?
2314580	2318540	It's just obnoxious because people think that because they're little wusses
2318540	2322740	about whether that I am and I'm just fine.
2322740	2323900	I was fine in Bloomington.
2323900	2325900	I was fine in Chicago.
2325900	2327540	I'm fine here.
2327540	2329260	So you're not doing it to prove a point.
2329260	2330820	You're doing it because you're more comfortable that way.
2330820	2333860	Well, at some point when people start telling you to put on pants,
2333860	2335060	you do it to prove a point.
2335060	2337060	Right. Honestly, I'm fine.
2337060	2340300	If I thought I'd be more comfortable wearing pants, would it just put them on?
2341660	2344020	But the worst thing is imagining when I when I was a kid,
2344020	2346140	people would tell me, take a shower, you got to comb your hair,
2346140	2348220	take a shower, you stink, you're a piece of shit.
2348220	2352580	And and then and then the word that like one day I took a shower
2352580	2355940	and combed my hair and got on the bus and on all the eighth graders were like,
2355940	2359700	well, look at the dude, dude, give me skin, man.
2359700	2362180	Give me give me five fucking seriously, man.
2362180	2363300	Good job. Good job.
2363300	2365460	And I was like, never again, motherfucker.
2366460	2368980	You just redefined lack of hygiene.
2368980	2374420	I I am I am I am going to be a millionaire and I'm going to smell like a butt.
2377380	2378580	You've done it. Yes.
2378580	2381300	You've accomplished your dream. Yeah.
2381300	2382660	Yeah, I took a shower in the hotel today.
2382660	2385140	You can't even tell. I'm I've got I'm so dirty.
2385140	2386740	It doesn't matter anymore.
2386740	2389740	I'm 800 showers behind.
2389740	2392540	I have to take like 80 showers in a road.
2392540	2394340	Our turbos smells pretty good.
2394340	2396140	I thought it's certainly about halfway point.
2396140	2397820	It would be smelling like a locker room on there.
2397820	2398740	But it's just pretty good.
2398740	2401340	I'm never you know, people tell me like like like girlfriends and stuff.
2401340	2403100	They go, you know, you talk about your lack of hygiene,
2403100	2404420	but you actually don't stink that bad.
2404420	2407300	And I think I think, you know, your body is covered with this like
2407580	2411380	this symbiotic like like community of microbes, you know.
2411380	2414860	And when you when you when you wash, you like kind of disrupt it a little bit.
2415140	2416500	I'm not saying people shouldn't wash.
2416500	2420020	I'm just saying like, like part of the part of your immune system,
2420020	2422980	your body's immune system that fights off like weird germs and stuff
2422980	2426260	from the outside world, part of why we've all been touching bathroom
2426260	2429700	doorknobs forever without having there be a giant epidemic
2429900	2433300	is because your body is there's no real estate on your body for germs
2433300	2435740	because it's covered in germs, your own germs.
2435740	2438540	Like you have just it's wall to wall.
2438700	2442020	The entire surface of your skin is shoulder to shoulder.
2442020	2444580	Fucking, you know, boogens and stuff.
2445620	2448820	So it's like some kind of revisionist hygiene history.
2448900	2451020	No, it's it's look it up. Google it.
2451020	2453100	Yeah. You cleanest.
2453100	2457500	If you take too many showers, you'll like break out more often and stuff
2457500	2461940	because it wipes out that bacteria that would otherwise be kind of protecting it.
2461980	2467380	And I think Aaron says like, because I'll not take a shower for it for many days.
2468260	2474220	And and Aaron said, you don't really start to you don't just start to stink.
2474220	2477260	Like, like you just start gradually to smell more and more like bread.
2480820	2482820	I've smelled you when you think it ain't bread.
2484700	2487980	Well, I mean, then then I don't love you.
2489100	2491580	I know we're never going to fuck.
2491580	2493900	Yeah, but maybe that's like a body chemistry thing.
2493900	2496420	I think so. I think I think people's noses and other people's
2496780	2498700	or like like there's a thing.
2498700	2500620	There's a like a it's like a speed dating thing.
2501380	2502460	I mean, there's a thing for anything.
2502460	2503940	I could make this up, but I'm not.
2503940	2508020	Somebody told me about this that I don't know where they're doing this,
2508020	2511980	but it's kind of it's like a speed dating kind of weird thing where people get together.
2511980	2517140	You you don't shower for a day or two days.
2517140	2518140	I don't know what it is.
2518140	2522700	You you take the clothes and then you you freeze them.
2522700	2527580	You bring them to this this gathering and then and then the people
2527580	2531820	do this speed dating thing where these thawed B.O.
2531820	2533940	shirts like no cologne, no deodorant.
2533940	2536020	But it's just it's just your B.O.
2536020	2537340	Men, men and women.
2537340	2541380	So it's like these anonymous piles of clothes and people go around in circles
2541380	2547740	and they smell the bread and you write down like what you're OK with.
2547740	2550540	Like what what what you're you know, like, oh, shirt number eight.
2550540	2553980	Like, I don't mind that it smells like my dad or something.
2553980	2559500	I don't know whatever, you know, and I can tell that person hasn't had a shower
2559500	2562820	for two days, but at the same time, I wasn't I wasn't repelled by it.
2563100	2568380	And and I'll tell you in the next podcast whether or not it's working.
2568380	2570980	I don't know if it's 80 people have been married.
2570980	2572780	And I don't know. That's all I heard.
2572780	2574340	I heard interesting concepts.
2574340	2576500	There is like you could do personality tests.
2576500	2579580	They they gave people shirts and had them wear them around for like a week.
2579580	2582700	And then they gave them to a lab and then they gave them to people
2582700	2585900	who weren't trained to like understand and they'd like made them smell it
2585900	2589060	and said, what do you think about this person who wear this shirt?
2589340	2592980	And they were like actually pretty accurate compared to if you just looked
2592980	2595980	at the person and tried to form a judgment. Interesting sense.
2596220	2599660	I mean, granted, our noses as primates have been totally shut down.
2599660	2602460	Like, that's why we can't we're we're blown away by dogs and cats
2602820	2605100	because we used to have snouts like that.
2605980	2609380	And we have our eyes move forward to the front of our head
2609380	2612980	to get stereoscopic color vision and all this equipment,
2612980	2615740	all this all this like computer equipment up behind your nose.
2616020	2620340	Like that had to get like kind of liquidated and like sold like and shut down.
2620340	2623180	So our noses compared to dogs are like like dog.
2623620	2625580	Dogs noses are pretty much their eyes.
2625580	2628100	Like dogs smell as much as we see.
2629020	2632540	And they they're like they just use their eyes to like not bump into a wall
2632540	2635660	and like kind of zero in on the butthole to smell.
2636820	2640460	But then when that then that butthole is like the Facebook page like they
2642180	2646380	I'm not the first person to bring this up at Wise Guys in Salt Lake City.
2646620	2648900	I'm sure Kevin Neeland's got 20 minutes on this.
2651780	2654820	But there's a there's a wealth of information they get out of that.
2654820	2657460	But all we get is it's it's a smells like poop.
2658260	2662100	But that being said, I think there is more to smell than we are used to.
2662420	2663420	To experience it.
2663420	2668100	Anyways, we got deep tonight, Salt Lake.
2668100	2671180	I mean, you can't say you didn't you didn't that Dan Herman didn't come
2671180	2673900	to your town and confuse you.
2674900	2677620	And that's that's what the show's about.
2678060	2680580	Should we should we go out in the crowd and find us?
2680820	2681980	We have to make our connection, man.
2681980	2683300	We're not we're not going to be here long.
2683300	2685780	OK, you want to you want to you want to make a personal connection with someone?
2685780	2686900	I mean, it's hard. It's hard.
2686900	2690220	Well, I mean, I like to go with with people who are feeling pain.
2690220	2693300	Like I like not necessarily physical, like like like someone who thinks
2693300	2696860	they had a pretty bad day and it really doesn't have to be in a funny way.
2696860	2699940	But anybody that's willing to like talk about like, I don't know,
2699940	2702940	you're going through some shit like like if it's a breakup
2702940	2706140	that you're not able to get over or like a job transition
2706140	2708580	or a long spate of unemployment.
2709380	2712060	What's up? Are you are you volunteering yourself?
2712060	2714100	Like going like I got some job troubles.
2714660	2716540	OK, let's bring them up. What's your name?
2716660	2717860	I'm Craig.
2717860	2719660	That's Craig.
2719660	2722740	This is Craig from Wisconsin.
2722740	2725340	Oh, Craig from Wisconsin.
2725340	2727580	I don't know why people didn't instinctively applaud you
2727580	2730340	when you came up onto the stage.
2730740	2732300	Maybe maybe you smell weird.
2732300	2734540	I don't know. Maybe maybe they maybe they.
2735980	2739180	Craig, so you're you're you're you're specifically you're having
2739180	2741460	a hard time transitioning occupationally.
2741460	2744820	Yeah, I taught art for 20 years, Dan.
2745540	2747540	And last year I had to resign
2747540	2749940	just because of the state of Wisconsin has got some.
2749940	2751220	Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah.
2751220	2753660	Wisconsin has horrible things going on educationally. Yes.
2754220	2756380	My my my brother's wife is a teacher.
2756380	2759580	Oh, but now I'm trying to figure out what to do next, man.
2760380	2763300	Yeah. Well, you consider the Dan Harmon lookalike contest.
2763300	2765340	It's happening. Yeah. Yeah.
2765340	2767900	I think it's tomorrow night in Ogden, Utah.
2768740	2770620	That's the grand prize is.
2770620	2771300	Let's let's get it.
2771300	2773300	Let's get a picture together here at the very least.
2775460	2777500	The well, can you tell us, Craig?
2777500	2779420	Like, like, like, holy shit.
2782260	2783260	Guys, I'm here.
2787100	2789060	Wow. That's nice.
2789060	2791060	Here, let me wear your glasses for a second. Sure.
2794820	2796980	So, Craig, tell me about your job. Hey.
2797940	2800500	Look, I was a teacher for 20 years, Dan.
2800740	2802820	And Wisconsin's fucked up.
2802820	2805780	You know, it's now I'm now I'm looking for more work.
2805860	2810020	No, you tell us, Craig, it's I was like, well, Craig was Dan.
2810020	2811820	I was going to make him rap.
2813500	2815540	Craig, can you can you can you? Yeah.
2815540	2818420	Well, wait, can you just get it?
2818420	2820260	We'll build up to it. Yeah, no, because I want to hear
2820260	2821860	about this Wisconsin thing, because I keep hearing about it.
2821860	2822860	It's my home state.
2822860	2824300	Shit is fucked up there.
2824300	2826700	So specifically, it's more it's more fucked up.
2826860	2829980	Like education, like, like, like, like, like, this is this is one of the it's,
2829980	2830900	you know, it's a hot button.
2830900	2833300	It's a liberal thing, but it's like, it's also so fucking true.
2833300	2836260	Like our like, like, it's it's one of the cheapest things
2836260	2837700	that we could be spending money on.
2837700	2839660	Well, I love the kids too, man.
2839660	2843500	I love the kids, but it's there's so many rules that are not working.
2843500	2846940	It's so easy to like suck money out of that out of that sector.
2846940	2849020	And it's it makes no sense.
2849020	2853300	It only makes sense to creepy rich people because they don't get rich
2853300	2856980	the next day by put by by putting any money into the idea that, yeah,
2856980	2860460	but like it happens so fast 20 years from now, you're going to feel that.
2860620	2863300	Anyways, can you tell us specifically what's going on in Wisconsin?
2863300	2865100	It has to do with like unions and stuff.
2865100	2868100	Yeah, they kind of busted up the unions for the teachers.
2868100	2871740	And and now the administrators of all the school districts
2871740	2873860	can make up their own set of rules.
2873860	2877740	So I'm not supposed to speak about this, but I had 40 kids in my classroom
2877740	2879700	to try to teach art to at once.
2879700	2881820	And it's like 40 kids is a lot of kids.
2882020	2884300	That was that was par for the course when I was in high school.
2884300	2886180	Oh, well, never mind. Never mind.
2886180	2888100	No, these are 6000 student schools.
2888100	2891820	OK, like I went to Marshall Marshall High before I went to Brown Deer.
2892180	2895300	And I was like, there was it 6000 4000 kids.
2896100	2898940	And then and then I went to the suburbs and it was 600 kids.
2898940	2901340	And it was like 15 or 20 kids in the class.
2901340	2903900	But when I was when I was in Milwaukee public schools,
2903900	2906700	there would be 30, 40 kids in the class, especially in art class,
2906700	2908500	where it's like, oh, you have to take art.
2908500	2910900	We don't want to spend any money on it.
2910900	2913300	You just six, six kids to a paintbrush.
2913300	2915900	And, you know, like, because who's going to enforce this?
2915900	2918900	I love dark class, but again, we had 30, 40 kids in my class.
2918900	2921620	And I don't I barely remember that teacher's name
2921620	2925580	because you got no personal interaction with like we're all making clay,
2925580	2927420	you know, statues and stuff like that was no input.
2927420	2929100	There was no connection at all.
2929100	2931420	And so you end up doing a thing and you get a grade on it.
2931420	2932420	But you don't know what you did.
2932420	2933300	You don't know why you did it.
2933300	2935780	You don't there's no there's no interaction at all.
2935780	2937900	There's no there's no nurturing or mentoring at all.
2938420	2941420	That must be especially hard in an art teacher where it's all about expression.
2941420	2943380	Well, you want them to be unique, right?
2943380	2945580	You don't want them to be cookie cutters and whatnot.
2945940	2947380	Yeah, they're human beings.
2947380	2948660	Like you have no idea.
2948660	2951260	Like we obviously we the grand scheme of things.
2951260	2955420	What happened is we we we know that education is important.
2955420	2957300	We know that our kids have to go to school.
2957300	2959740	And then all of a sudden this becomes like this.
2959740	2961980	It is we have to have this system.
2961980	2966140	So it's like and then how do you allocate funding to this system?
2966420	2968300	Because it's not socialism.
2968300	2971340	It's it's the government funds this this thing.
2971340	2972580	So how much should we fund it?
2972580	2975300	Well, what are your test scores in this school?
2975300	2979900	OK, so if our test scores are this, then we get this amount of money for microscopes.
2979900	2982980	And if they don't and the whole thing gets fucked up by guess what?
2982980	2986700	Money like it's no place in medicine or education.
2986700	2988420	I'm sorry to just be a typical liberal.
2988420	2992340	But like like like like like like like how how much more clear could it be?
2992540	2997900	That shit like education and medicine like like like the dollar getting near that stuff.
2997900	3003420	Like how like like it's only a couple of minutes before the for the fucking weird paradoxes start to happen.
3004140	3005620	So what do we have to do in Wisconsin?
3005620	3006460	I'll make it happen tonight.
3006460	3008620	Craig, awesome.
3008620	3009980	Are you are you out of a job now?
3009980	3013100	You're retired or I'm I'm currently unemployed.
3013700	3015340	You want to get back into teaching again?
3015340	3019860	Part of me will always be a teacher, but I want to I want to come with Dan and write movies.
3021780	3025260	You guys could like go to meetings like Dan could sleep and you could go in.
3025820	3027620	Yeah, it's like an Olsen twins movie.
3029220	3030740	Let's trick them.
3031220	3034380	Dan you'd be sleeping in the car and Dan would come out like you tag out.
3034380	3036820	You'd put his shirt on and you'd smell like him and you're going to the meeting.
3037580	3039620	Zemeckis watch a movie about a giant go.
3039820	3040420	Here we go.
3040420	3042020	Wait a second. Dan.
3042020	3043540	Dan Harmon.
3043540	3044980	You know, we broke for lunch.
3044980	3048020	What were you weren't you wearing glasses earlier before you before?
3048020	3050020	Oh, yes.
3050260	3052540	The better to see you with Mr. Spielberg.
3053540	3055460	OK. I don't know.
3055700	3058700	Just like you were being a real asshole a couple of hours ago, but now I really like you.
3058780	3060420	You seem a little older and wiser now.
3061740	3062940	You seem more artistic.
3062940	3065180	Yeah, you smell different.
3066780	3067180	All right.
3067180	3071540	Well, well, well, aside from taking you to L.A., I mean, come to L.A., write a screenplay.
3071900	3074180	You know, have you ever written screenplays before?
3074180	3075540	Is that something you dabble in?
3075540	3077180	Yes, I do.
3080420	3082580	What kind of genre of stuff do you do?
3083220	3085940	I've I've done some 101 pieces.
3085980	3089820	Oh, so I've yeah, I think Channel 101 he's talking about.
3089820	3091500	Our nonprofit.
3091500	3096940	I did a puppet art teacher from Wisconsin called Wackjack years ago.
3097980	3098620	Remember that one?
3098620	3100740	It didn't make it that might ring a bell.
3100740	3102620	It didn't make it into the screening.
3102620	3104940	It was the seventh one voted off.
3104940	3106580	So I didn't make it quite in.
3106580	3109100	All right. Well, I'm sorry.
3109100	3110500	It would have changed my life.
3110500	3112340	Yeah. No way to go, Harmon.
3112340	3117460	If you want to change your life, all you got to do is rap.
3120820	3126540	Oh, yo, yo, yo, yo, I'll start.
3128220	3130500	I'll start. You teach art.
3130500	3132540	You're unemployed. I just farted.
3133380	3135300	Sorry, I didn't mean to do it.
3135300	3139220	I fucked your mama like her name was Hewitt Hewitt.
3140580	3142620	Sorry, I'll start over.
3142620	3144860	Breakdown, Salt Lake City.
3144860	3146180	Only thing that rhymes with that.
3146540	3148540	It's your mama's titty.
3148540	3151980	Lake made a salt drove to get here with ice instead of asphalt.
3152180	3154300	The bus almost tipped over three times.
3154660	3156620	Now I'm going to express it through rhyme.
3156620	3159020	It's a hard place to get to, but I love the people here.
3159020	3161380	I fucked your mama so hard, a titty sprayed beer.
3163900	3166340	Craig coming to the mic.
3166340	3168940	Craig's coming to the mic.
3168940	3171580	Hey, it's time here at the school, Mr.
3171580	3173580	Harmony is feeling so cool.
3173580	3174460	Hey there, buddy.
3174460	3178140	Don't do nothing fun, because if you do, you're going to kill the son.
3178140	3179860	Oh, wow. Yeah.
3179860	3181420	Wow. She got mythological.
3181420	3185260	That's mythical. It's Egyptian.
3185260	3187900	Well, you eat the sun every time you make a painting.
3188220	3192700	Holy shit. My, my, my, uh, uh, sorry. Sorry.
3195420	3196780	The sun just got eaten.
3196780	3198780	Right. Yeah. OK.
3199820	3202460	Sky black as cloth. Can't see anything.
3202580	3205020	I fucked your mama so hard, her pussy started to sing.
3205540	3208100	Said la la la. And I said, shh.
3212620	3214340	A story's building.
3214340	3217460	So just so far, just to keep it up today.
3219220	3222180	A woman's titties sprayed beer.
3222180	3224100	And then somebody got bad grades in school.
3224100	3226460	So the son got eaten.
3226460	3229180	And now a woman's pussy is singing.
3229180	3231700	Yeah. Maybe we can connect those dots.
3231700	3233700	OK. All right.
3233700	3235540	Take it, Craig.
3235540	3238060	The sun is gone. Hey, mom, she's fighting the Fox
3238060	3240340	because she's the one with the singing box.
3240340	3242780	So don't go there. She's not here.
3243060	3245220	Everybody go get a beer.
3245420	3247780	Oh, Salt Lake Craig.
3247780	3250980	Salt Lake Craig wrapped it up for us. Right now. Yeah.
3251220	3253580	Salt Lake Craig, everybody.
3253580	3257540	All right. For God's sake, support education every time you
3258260	3261140	do so much every time you get all excited.
3261140	3262380	Thank you, Craig.
3262380	3264660	Every four years, you know, we have this big ritual
3264660	3267820	where we pretend that the one guy we vote for is going to make
3267820	3269820	a huge fucking difference for four years.
3269820	3271420	There's also a bunch of other stuff on the ballot.
3271420	3273860	Every time you see the word education, say yes,
3274780	3277700	because there's no way you will ever go broke
3278020	3281740	giving money to teachers in schools. It's impossible.
3283060	3285540	Here's some stuff that costs a lot of money.
3285780	3289660	Giant fucking weapons like that will never be useful
3289660	3292420	against a guy who is who is born in a crater
3293180	3295580	and just wants to blow shit up with his own body.
3295780	3300100	Like, like, like we could we with the tanks will keep they will keep
3301500	3304060	let's melt a couple of them down and turn them into erasers.
3304060	3306300	I think that's how that works.
3306300	3312620	So we made a human connection. Your city, your state, like the the the the lower,
3312620	3315300	the more local your politics get, the more important they are.
3315420	3318780	The pothole outside your house needs filling.
3318780	3322420	It gets filled or not filled based on a person or a community going like,
3322420	3324980	let's fill the pothole, take those resources, allocate them.
3325140	3327180	A Walmart getting built on your corner.
3327180	3328540	That's like local shit.
3328540	3332660	You know, the the stop sign that stops a car accident that stops people from dying.
3332820	3335540	We argue about the dumbest, fakest shit.
3335660	3337020	I'm 40 years old.
3337020	3338860	You guys are some of you are 25.
3338860	3342860	Like you think gay marriage and abortion is that they've made it up.
3342860	3343780	They made it up.
3343780	3347740	They're pretending these are issues because they're all in fucking cahoots with each other.
3347900	3349340	Fuck these guys.
3349340	3352820	Just like, like, like, like local politics are kind of important.
3352860	3356500	All politics are bullshit, but local politics are a little more.
3356660	3358700	You get a little fucking yardage.
3358700	3362140	If you if you if you if you decide to put it's all about yardage, yardage,
3362140	3363340	it's all about yardage.
3365380	3368980	Don't don't. Yeah, it's getting tangled and crazy in Wisconsin because,
3369780	3373460	you know, you know, we get we get we start thinking that we need some superman
3373460	3375500	in the White House in order to change the world.
3375500	3378540	And all that guy is is just as, you know,
3378540	3381660	I'm sure he's a great guy, but what the fuck is he going to do except
3381660	3383620	to walk around and not embarrass me when he talks?
3383620	3385980	That's why I voted for him.
3385980	3389100	I literally just voted for Obama because it was like, oh, he can speak.
3389140	3391700	Like, like, I'm so embarrassed.
3391700	3394220	Everybody crazy for I mean, like the Mormon community here,
3394220	3396900	was everybody really wild from it during the election?
3396900	3397900	Yeah.
3397900	3399740	I want to I'm curious about the Mormon thing.
3399740	3402020	Like, I know, like, like, like a good half of the population here
3402020	3403900	is still actually maybe not here.
3403900	3407740	But like, like, how many how many Mormons do we have
3407740	3409940	by applause in the audience and a harm in town audience?
3410980	3412900	Oh, quite a few. Nothing. Nothing.
3414260	3417420	20 percent, maybe that makes it your next Mormon.
3417860	3421700	The city was found by Mormons and is now like basically
3421980	3424900	according to Wikipedia, half half non Mormon.
3425220	3428380	I mean, it's a it's a capital city in a city of industry now.
3428380	3431660	It's not about Mormonism anymore, necessarily.
3431700	3434860	There's not like a Mormon train like that's propelled by Mormonism.
3435940	3438340	The train is has electricity in it.
3438340	3441940	And the banks have money in them, not snakes.
3443140	3444860	I don't know what Mormons believe, but
3446740	3448340	I think they talk to snakes. I can't remember.
3450820	3452140	Should we get a Mormon person up here?
3452140	3453220	Oh, yeah. Can we have a Mormon up?
3453220	3455860	Let's have a Mormon, a real not a not a Jack Mormon.
3455900	3458340	Not a let's get let's get let's get a gal up.
3458340	3459380	Let's get a woman on stage.
3459380	3463500	OK, yeah. Let's have a female, a female woman that won't be a
3464980	3468700	we want a Mormons, a proud Mormon.
3468780	3471100	Are you are you not a self loathing Mormon?
3473220	3474180	What's your name, Miss?
3474180	3476300	Talitha. OK, say again.
3476300	3480580	Talitha, Talitha, Talitha, like Eurethra.
3483700	3485500	Like Eurese.
3485500	3487980	No, I met I met a guy.
3488020	3490820	There was a guy that had me sign his book after the show.
3491340	3495300	And he said, can you make everybody's got a weird name like Ridley
3495300	3498140	and originally and Blake Blake are blue blue blue.
3498380	3499660	Yeah, the more original, the better.
3499660	3501500	There's a thousand ways to spell Aaron.
3501500	3503020	There's a thousand ways to spell Michael.
3503020	3504340	It's I always ask.
3504340	3507260	And then and I was so used to asking, like, you get the right spelling.
3507260	3510020	The guy said, like, can you make it out to Jathan?
3510220	3512580	And I was like, J-A-T-H-A-N.
3512580	3515220	And he's like, you know, J-A-S-O-N.
3515260	3518020	Oh, I have a horrible speech impediment.
3520580	3522700	It's really bad.
3522700	3525220	It's so bad that I found like a cartoon.
3525340	3526860	Thanks for pointing that out.
3526860	3529900	Oh, my God. But he was I mean, he was, you know, he's a Armenian.
3529900	3532500	So he was what a drag to have a lisp and you have an S in your name.
3532500	3535060	That's a that's a bug.
3535060	3535620	All right. Sorry.
3535620	3537180	So her name might be Talisa.
3537180	3538100	We don't know. Maybe she has.
3538100	3538900	That's what I was saying.
3538900	3540500	That's that's a joke I was making.
3540500	3541700	But no, it's Eurethra. Right.
3541700	3544260	What is it? Right.
3544260	3546780	And you're you're our first Mormon that I know of.
3546780	3549740	I don't know if anyone is a closet Mormon that we've had on the show.
3550780	3553220	And we're in we're in the Mormon capital of the country.
3554100	3556460	And I don't know what to ask.
3556460	3559020	What do we what do we what do we do with the Mormon, Jeff?
3559500	3560140	I don't know.
3560140	3563780	I it occurs to me that I know I really know nothing about Mormonism,
3563780	3566780	except the Mormon families that were in my high school.
3566780	3570100	And they were I know that they were very tightly knit, very large families,
3570100	3572660	generally, and very, very, very close.
3572660	3575460	And they had a little their little home evening or home.
3575460	3577380	What do you call that family? Family home evening.
3577380	3579740	All right. Are you like, do you still do that with your family?
3579740	3582460	Is it is it still a big are you come from a large family as well?
3582460	3586580	I do. Well, I have I have a pretty big family for.
3588820	3592820	I don't know by whose standards, but like I've got
3593500	3596100	I actually have five kids and I'm 31. Wow.
3597340	3599540	And that's a big deal because, Jeff, what I've heard about
3599540	3602300	Mormons is that you all get your own planet like in the afterlife.
3602900	3605420	That's that's one of the eight things that I've heard about Mormonism.
3605940	3609460	Is that the part of the scheme of the afterlife involves like your own.
3609460	3613660	Actually, I've I've had three kids and then we adopted two kids, too.
3613660	3616460	But yeah, big families is pretty common. I've heard so.
3616460	3620060	So are these things like are the caricatures like remember when 9-11 happened?
3620180	3623140	All the ticker tape on CNN could talk about is the 70 virgins
3623380	3625220	because everyone wanted to know why who would do this?
3625220	3627620	Why would they do it? And that was the talking points.
3627820	3631980	Let's let's find the weirdest, silliest sounding thing about Islam that we can
3631980	3633420	and just repeat it over and over again.
3633420	3635860	Well, they think in heaven that your dick is a pine tree.
3637380	3640700	You know, like, like, hey, they already blew up a building.
3640700	3641660	We already hate them.
3641660	3644740	Like, like, like, like, like, why did they do it?
3644940	3646740	I'm just wondering, like,
3646740	3649980	because Christianity has all kinds of weird shit about it
3649980	3655260	that if you've focused in on and and and and and Judaism and everything like
3656260	3660580	for a modern Mormon, can we what do we talk about magic underwear?
3660580	3661620	I've heard.
3661620	3664660	I've heard about the planet that everyone gets when they die.
3665180	3668540	And and no coffee, no coffee.
3668620	3671140	Is that that's Amish, isn't it?
3671140	3672420	No. Oh, no stimulants.
3672420	3673980	No. Yeah. No Diet Coke. Right.
3673980	3676780	There's yeah, there's a it's kind of.
3676780	3678740	Yeah, like a health code, kind of.
3678740	3680900	Right. So I don't drink alcohol
3681820	3687140	and you stay away from addictive substances just in general.
3687140	3689660	Right. So you get to have cool haircuts, though.
3690100	3691940	I do have a there's no rule against that.
3691940	3694060	She looked very cool.
3694060	3696500	I'm telling the podcast audience that sounded patronizing.
3698380	3700500	If she's actually really if you had a podcast audience
3700500	3703100	you were constantly reporting to, you would sound sarcastic sometimes.
3703100	3705060	Like, like the person at the bank would go, you can't have your money.
3705060	3706620	I go, I can't have my money, folks.
3706620	3709020	It's just the way it works here.
3710900	3714620	Yeah. So let's say magic underwear.
3714620	3715500	Where does that what does that mean?
3715500	3718460	I I've heard that phrase magic underwear.
3718540	3721500	I am. I'm sure that's speaking in terms of
3723220	3726660	a clothing garment that the LDS people wear.
3727180	3729700	Right. It's LDS, Latter Day Saints.
3729820	3731820	So that's the church, the name of the church.
3731820	3733180	And so it's Matt.
3733180	3735220	Well, what it would know, nothing magic.
3735220	3738460	It's it's symbolic. Right. So what is it?
3738460	3740420	Is it about chastity? Is it about?
3740420	3742940	Partly. Yeah. Yeah, symbolic of.
3744020	3747500	Get really specific, because I literally I swear to God, I've heard that phrase.
3747500	3751500	Like people who are who are hating on Mormons, they go, they have magic underwear.
3751540	3752700	They believe in magic underwear.
3752700	3755340	It's just like and then you move on with your conversation, go out of the calamari.
3755340	3757540	Like I what?
3758180	3760860	So knowing that that's all all I've heard.
3760860	3761820	That's all I've heard.
3761820	3763380	Like, what does that mean?
3763380	3766460	And I also haven't seen the Trey Parker Matt Stone musical.
3766460	3768820	I don't know. I don't know anything.
3771420	3775620	I don't I don't know how to get into it without having like a whole discussion
3775620	3779980	about, you know, all the fundamentals, but let's do it.
3781980	3782820	We got all night.
3782820	3783700	I don't know if this is the right.
3783700	3787660	We haven't been here on Tuesday, but we already can get the missionaries here
3787660	3790220	in about five seconds.
3790220	3791540	We already burned through Fart Corner.
3791540	3793500	We got nothing left.
3794140	3795780	I was hoping to get farted on.
3795780	3797620	Well, is there fear of getting it wrong,
3797620	3800660	of like sounding like you're misrepresenting your your religion?
3800660	3804100	Or is there is there fear of people that aren't aren't affiliated,
3804100	3809500	like, like judging you or what's the just a fear of making the podcast
3809500	3811700	six hours long because it's that complicated?
3811700	3814660	No, no, I mean, the the gospel is simple.
3815860	3817860	It's a Christian gospel.
3817860	3821100	Right. So it's the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
3822140	3825140	There were more books later in the new world.
3825940	3829700	Oh, yeah, yeah, you're familiar books written at the same time that.
3829700	3833580	Yeah, but underwear, the underwear like like you can't do.
3833580	3835820	You don't want to cartoonify your religion.
3835820	3838580	If you go back to like in the Old Testament,
3838580	3841140	the Book of Exodus and things like that, they talk about
3842580	3846060	they talk about when they go to the temple and
3847980	3850180	putting on the holy garment.
3850180	3852180	So it's it's the same type of thing.
3852180	3853860	It's symbolic of certain covenants you make.
3853860	3855580	So this is not a sexual thing at all.
3855580	3859300	This is not about. Oh, oh, see, like, like, you know, Orthodox Jews,
3859300	3864220	like some like there's some sects of of Judaism that where they have sex
3864220	3866820	through a hole in a blanket or whatever,
3866820	3869620	because everyone has their own, you know, old religions.
3869620	3871900	They have old, old ideas about sex that are.
3872220	3874820	I thought when I heard magic underwear, I automatically assumed it was some kind
3874820	3876300	of like that you were during.
3876300	3878260	Yeah, there was like didn't have a flap in it or something.
3879260	3883460	That is so that so that and that when you're 16, you got a flapper
3884780	3887100	and then you get to go to prom.
3887100	3890300	And Talitha, I'm assuming you're not wearing it now.
3890300	3892340	You were when you go into the temple, right?
3892340	3893580	No, at all times.
3893580	3895460	So it's like a yarmulke or I mean, they don't know.
3895460	3897660	I mean, they don't know. Are you wearing it now?
3897660	3898300	I am. Yeah.
3898300	3901860	And it's about like a yarmulke is about like humbling yourself before God.
3901860	3905820	Like you're covering your head like a symbolic, like God fearing thing.
3906020	3908660	So this underwear is covering your symbolic of
3910340	3913740	well, starting like your body is like your temple.
3913740	3915100	Your body is your gift from God.
3915100	3916820	It houses your spirit.
3916820	3919180	So your body is kind of like your most sacred
3921140	3922380	physical possession, I guess.
3922380	3924820	Where do you and the fundamental level,
3924820	3927780	no matter what you're doing out in society underneath at all,
3927980	3930820	your is your relationship with the cosmos?
3930820	3933500	I mean, this is like when I was a kid, we had a thing called underoos
3933540	3937620	that that were the sacred to you.
3937900	3940060	Well, I mean, for in a secular sense.
3940060	3943300	Yeah, say you're as I'm getting picked on.
3943300	3946620	I'm getting a swirly, but I'm the Hulk down here.
3947780	3948900	They just don't know it.
3948900	3950780	I'm Aquaman.
3950780	3955220	You know, I have a relationship with with with with, you know,
3956260	3958860	that doesn't sound like magic, magic underwear.
3958900	3961180	See, people are too. It's too.
3961180	3963700	We trivialize stuff, but also people are very freaked out
3963700	3965740	by other people's spirituality and stuff like that.
3965740	3967420	So we do the opposite of trivializing it, right?
3967420	3971020	We make it into too big a deal because every single little thing
3971020	3974860	like like religious, religious traditions and rituals
3974860	3979060	are little, tiny little things that that that sometimes have practicality
3979060	3983180	and sometimes don't, but in all cases are are are designed
3983180	3987180	to remind the individual in a world where God's not hanging out all the time
3987340	3991060	that God is a part of their life, that they have a relationship
3991060	3993900	with the unknown and scientists get to
3995580	3998020	punch the clock at work every day.
3998020	4001300	Their job is to study the unknown and like figure shit out
4001300	4003820	so they don't need magic underwear to remind them.
4003980	4006340	But if you work at Verizon,
4006340	4008740	there's a lot of people that are going to try to make you think
4008740	4011860	that you should worship Verizon and they should go fuck themselves
4011860	4014540	if you're a Mormon because you like when you go home at night,
4014540	4016700	you're like you're beholden to this other thing.
4017660	4018980	Do you go to a store to get them?
4018980	4020060	Do you make them yourself?
4021060	4022260	It's an authorized store.
4022260	4024820	Yeah, so the church makes them.
4025460	4026940	Yeah, it's like an authorized pattern.
4026940	4027980	It's like kosher food.
4027980	4030860	Like there's some factory somewhere where there's a rabbi going like,
4030980	4032500	this hot dog is good to go.
4033500	4035220	Now, I mean, it's just an authorized pattern.
4035220	4037060	It's don't answer this if you don't want to.
4037060	4038140	I'm not being creepy.
4038140	4039060	What do they look like?
4039060	4041660	What part of your body physically?
4044060	4044700	Granny underwear.
4044700	4046860	Just just like from here to here.
4047220	4047900	Really?
4047900	4049820	Like an old, tiny swimsuit?
4049820	4050820	Like in the...
4050820	4054980	No, just like a shirt and shorts.
4054980	4055780	Well, I'm glad.
4055780	4057820	I still make one piece of it.
4057820	4060620	I hope everyone else got their buddy's words, but I certainly do.
4060620	4063660	I'm glad I finally learned about the magic of Verizon.
4063660	4064820	OK, now let's say you go to the beach.
4064820	4066500	Let's say you're taking a swim in the Salt Lake.
4066500	4068740	What do you swim in the Salt Lake?
4068740	4070780	You're taking a float in the Salt Lake?
4070780	4075220	Yeah, then you would just not wear them for activities that wouldn't...
4075220	4075740	Gotcha.
4075740	4078340	That you couldn't normally do without.
4078340	4083180	Like, so, you know, if I'm going swimming or going to work out or...
4083180	4083700	All right.
4083700	4084980	You got five children you can have any more.
4084980	4086980	Is that the limit?
4089020	4092060	I'm not coming on to you, by the way.
4092060	4093020	You have sexy hair.
4093020	4094380	We want to know what you're going to do.
4094380	4095780	Let's make it around six.
4095780	4096580	And how...
4096580	4097700	I'm drawing conclusions.
4097700	4098900	How fertile are you?
4102500	4103420	OK, well, yeah, I don't know.
4103420	4105340	I keep thinking like, oh, there's a big wrap up question,
4105500	4107780	because I don't want to just have brought you up and talked about underwear.
4107780	4111260	But communication is always a fucking thing.
4111260	4114020	Like, I'm obsessed with race, you know, all the time.
4114020	4114860	I grew up in the 70s.
4114860	4117860	I was like, when I was a kid on the playground, I was like one white kid
4117860	4119900	and they'd be surrounded by a bunch of black kids.
4119900	4123820	And like, I remember back then it was the 70s and like we were coming off
4123820	4127580	our Norman Lear sitcoms and everyone was talking about the fact
4127580	4128580	that people were different.
4128580	4130940	You'd have conversations, you'd go up to a black kid and go,
4130940	4133140	can I touch your hair?
4133140	4134180	What does it feel like?
4134580	4136660	Or like, and overall, you wouldn't know.
4136660	4140500	People are communicating because that's the human gift, is to communicate.
4140700	4144700	And then like this, like somebody saying, oh, they have magic underwear over
4144700	4146860	over calamari, and then that's all I hear.
4146860	4150500	And then like all of the problem is in everything that's not explained.
4150740	4154340	Like, it actually doesn't sound very, very, very weird at all.
4154340	4158260	And it doesn't sound very magical, you know, sounds like ritualistic,
4158260	4160980	ceremonial, ceremonial, symbolic.
4162580	4164140	Does it have a big M on it?
4165140	4168340	No, that's that's Mario, that's Mario, I'm sorry.
4170020	4172780	Well, let's let's have a hand for our Mormon representative.
4173180	4175540	Thank you, Talitha. Thank you.
4177100	4179180	I was hoping I could get farted on.
4179180	4180860	You want to get farted on? I was hoping.
4180860	4182660	All right. You want the music?
4182660	4184500	Yes, please. Oh, sorry.
4184500	4186020	Sorry. Pretend I didn't do that.
4186020	4188820	Talitha wants the music.
4188820	4190540	Fart Corner.
4190540	4192940	Religious edition.
4194860	4196780	All faiths from corner to corner.
4196780	4198140	Everyone's going to get farted on.
4198140	4201460	That's a Garen Torner made up a new word that can do that.
4201660	4204060	Human beings can make up words and religions.
4204060	4205820	That's our talent. That's what we do.
4205820	4208340	It's called mythology. So scoop to do.
4210220	4211740	Farting on a Mormon.
4211740	4213460	Farting on a Mormon.
4213460	4215620	Talitha, everybody. Thank you so much.
4220340	4223380	You know what Joseph Campbell said about religion, Jeff?
4223420	4224580	Don't don't fart on it.
4224580	4227620	People to paraphrase Joseph Campbell, people fuck it up
4227620	4230820	because they think that Bibles are newspapers like they don't
4231100	4235380	like your religion is supposed to be have have a transparency to it.
4235380	4237220	You're supposed to be in on the joke.
4237220	4239020	You're supposed to have one foot in, one foot out.
4239020	4242740	The whole point of religion, the whole point of God
4242900	4246060	is that the jar that God comes in says on the label.
4246060	4248180	You're not supposed to understand it.
4248460	4250820	It's not it's not fucking steak sauce.
4251060	4253820	You don't get to incorporate it into your day to day
4253900	4256940	without any degree of problems or difficulties with the people around you.
4257140	4258620	It's a very personal thing.
4258620	4260580	Some religions make it a communal thing.
4260580	4263980	And then notice how their communities and their kids have higher test scores
4263980	4266980	and bigger pools and and we get jealous of them.
4266980	4269180	And then we throw bricks at their windows because
4271100	4275460	it's when you yeah, I fucking it's it's it's God, dude.
4275740	4277300	It's like it's confusing shit.
4277300	4279980	It's it's not it's it both exists and doesn't exist.
4280300	4282620	That's that's a big confuser right there, isn't it?
4283180	4285500	That's that's a tough one to handle.
4285500	4288980	It's because it's not if he does, he's not going to come down and go like,
4288980	4290220	hey, welcome to Wise Guys.
4290220	4291900	Is everybody doing OK?
4291900	4293500	That would be the worst God ever.
4293500	4296060	Like, like as soon as he does that, he's fired.
4296660	4299180	Like he becomes Kevin Neelan.
4299180	4302340	As soon as he makes an appearance, that's all he is, is Kevin Neelan.
4302940	4306180	He retains God status by staying out of the picture.
4306180	4309460	There are less your job to there are less images of Jesus in a church
4309460	4311340	than there are of Kevin Neelan in this comedy club.
4314420	4317260	Jesus is good with just that one like, hey, I did a thing in a second.
4317300	4318540	And our parents fuck us up.
4318540	4320580	But that's like, you know, it's a popular 25.
4320580	4322420	When you're 25, you go like, well, I don't.
4322420	4326580	But you smoke a joint and you go like, oh, man, you know, God is fucking bullshit.
4326580	4328780	I don't believe in some guy in a cloud with a beard.
4328780	4330700	You know, I'm spiritual, but I'm not religious.
4330700	4332140	And I was like, it's fine, it's fine.
4332140	4336500	But no, you're just because your parents are dipshits doesn't mean that like,
4337060	4339740	you know, Santa Claus and God are the same thing.
4339740	4342460	I thought it was just your parents trying to like pull a whammy on you.
4342540	4346500	Spencer, Spencer, do you go all the way to jaded cynicism
4346500	4348260	just to just to get back at your parents?
4348260	4353460	What a waste of a giant brain that's designed to like create and and and
4353620	4356500	and live mythology.
4356500	4359900	Spencer, Spencer, do you have any spiritual side to you?
4359900	4360700	Do you believe in God?
4360700	4362780	What's your take on the whole?
4362780	4364900	I was raised a Christian.
4364900	4368380	And when I was young, I accepted the Lord.
4371140	4372540	Sorry, it's a total waste thing.
4372540	4374820	It wasn't a it wasn't a leap of faith for me.
4374820	4376820	It was like, OK, there's this dude he did.
4376820	4380100	I mean, if you're going to describe that moment, can we do it D&D style?
4380140	4384900	I guess. Spencer, I'm being attacked by Christian parents.
4385740	4390820	OK, with Bibles, I was I was talking about a thing.
4390820	4392580	I can't switch gears that fast.
4392580	4394740	Oh, sorry. He was going to talk about God.
4394740	4396700	But he was going to explain what was going on.
4396700	4398500	I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
4398500	4401700	So walking into the room clutching Bibles.
4403340	4407380	Your parents say they want to pray with you before they go out to eat.
4409380	4412180	Swallowing your pride, you acquiesce.
4414540	4417660	No, but I mean, I just it made sense to me as a kid.
4417660	4420700	And then I grew up and it made less sense to me.
4420700	4423220	And I was never someone who had faith like in anything.
4423220	4424460	I don't have faith that my mom
4424500	4426900	was going to go back, you know, come home if she left.
4426900	4428980	I didn't have faith that the bus was going to arrive.
4428980	4430340	I have faith in nothing.
4430340	4433940	So when it stopped making sense, I was like, OK, this doesn't make sense.
4433940	4435700	I stopped taking it to be fact.
4435700	4440260	So I think that there's definitely some sort of ethereal, metaphysical power.
4440260	4443660	And it manifests itself in many ways that we don't understand.
4443660	4446260	I don't know what those are because we don't understand them.
4446260	4450500	Ghosts, the Loch Ness Monster and Spontaneous Combustion.
4450500	4453700	Those could all be the same thing, like those could be miracles
4453740	4455220	or those could all be psychic powers.
4455220	4458020	Do you believe the Loch Ness Monster makes Spontaneous Combustion happen?
4458100	4461540	Yeah, whenever you like the dreams about the sun.
4461820	4466420	No, absolutely. I mean, not I when I was growing up, my parents were Christian
4466420	4469580	and tried to tell me when I would break a flower pot, they'd go swear in the Bible
4470020	4471380	that you didn't break it and all this stuff.
4471380	4474340	Nothing will make you an atheist quicker than Christian parents like like.
4474940	4479620	And that's that's a proud American tradition like like like because your parents
4479620	4483460	Christianity is like like like like like man, it can really blow.
4483460	4485020	It's like their car. It's a parenting.
4485020	4487060	You get a station wagon from it that you don't want either.
4487060	4490420	Like like your dream is to get a Camaro.
4491580	4494700	When I was a kid, I was I was raised in a Lutheran school as a little kid
4494700	4497700	and you had the Sunday school and you heard the Bible stories.
4497700	4498900	That was the only thing I kind of liked.
4498900	4501580	I never knew what they meant, but I like the mythology of it.
4501580	4504940	I was like the storytelling about like people blowing trumpets and knocking walls down.
4504940	4506860	I have no idea what the point of it all was.
4506860	4509700	But I knew that Lutheran Church, you get to sit there and doodle and nobody cared.
4509700	4510460	So I just drew a lot.
4511060	4514660	And I would leave the church and I go up to the pastor and he would put his hand out
4514660	4516140	and he would say, let's see what you drew.
4516140	4517700	He didn't care that I wasn't listening.
4517700	4519340	He actually liked my little drawings.
4519340	4522420	I've told the story before I think on the podcast where I went to Sunday school
4522420	4525740	and my mom asked, what did you do today in Sunday school?
4525740	4529020	It was like our first day in Sunday school and I told her and she pulled me out
4529020	4534220	because it was like we learned to recognize Bible characters with flashcards.
4534220	4535940	We learned to recognize them visually.
4536620	4544740	I can tell you the difference between Ham and Noah because Ham had a cane in his hand.
4546580	4547940	Noah had a backpack.
4547940	4550740	But confusingly, they were both cartoons.
4550740	4552980	They both looked like Captain Caveman.
4552980	4555220	Confusingly, Cain had a ham in his hand.
4556660	4557940	And I explained this to my mom.
4557940	4560100	I said, I can tell you whose ham's wife looks like.
4560100	4561820	I can tell you Noah's wife looks like.
4561820	4562700	That is ridiculous.
4562700	4567020	And my mom said, that is ridiculous and you don't have to go to Sunday school anymore.
4567020	4568020	Holy smoke.
4568860	4572620	But she also put the whammy on me with the, you know, God exists and don't...
4572620	4577340	Because if I would like, if I'd be programming my Commodore 64 and it wouldn't work right,
4577340	4579740	I would go, God damn it, fucking computer.
4579740	4584140	And my mom would go, you know, she'd like slap me and go like, don't use the Lord's name in vain.
4584140	4588420	It was like, like, she'd be like, really, I think she was carrying some shit over from her parents.
4588420	4591420	She just knew that if she had a kid that didn't respect God,
4591420	4592820	that she was a fuck up as a parent.
4592820	4598380	So she was just out of paranoia and anxiety was like, just putting the fear into me and nothing else.
4598380	4599340	There was nothing.
4599340	4603180	And I remember I had these books that would be like, like the hand me downs of like,
4603180	4607740	Oh, see Dick and Jane hang out and oh, they lost their dog.
4607740	4608620	Oh, where's the dog?
4608620	4609260	Where's Spot?
4609260	4610260	We can't find Spot.
4610260	4611220	And I'm like, Oh, I'm learning to read.
4611220	4612020	This is great.
4612020	4613180	Well, we can't find Spot.
4613180	4614060	What should we do?
4614060	4614780	Turn the page.
4614780	4615660	Let's pray.
4615660	4616420	What?
4617420	4619140	Jesus could help you find your dog.
4619140	4626380	And Jesus would be hanging out in his robe in the middle of this book about these fifties kids looking for their dog.
4626380	4629500	I remember that being a drag because it wasn't a good story.
4629500	4634140	It was Deus Ex Machina and also weird.
4634140	4637860	Like Jesus is not like a cool looking character in a children's book.
4637860	4638420	Pardon me, Dan.
4638420	4638900	It's very interesting.
4638900	4642220	Carlos, could I get another ale, please?
4642220	4643380	Did you call him Carlos?
4643380	4644220	That's his name, isn't it?
4644220	4645020	It's Marcus, isn't it?
4645020	4645660	It says Marcus.
4645660	4646940	He's wearing someone else's name tag.
4646940	4647740	What the fuck?
4649860	4653020	Wait, so your name is Carlos and you steal clothes.
4653020	4653940	Do you have any idea?
4656140	4658140	We should point out he's definitely white.
4658140	4661820	Like, like, like, because I don't want podcast listeners to hear, just hear.
4661820	4665940	Oh, yeah, there's a guy named Carlos that's wearing Marcus's clothes.
4665940	4669540	What happened to Marcus?
4669540	4670540	Oh, you found it again.
4670540	4671940	Oh, mystery solves.
4671940	4672620	Thank you.
4672620	4673780	Thank you, Kevin Neeland.
4673780	4677180	I don't know plot thickens as far as I'm concerned, not mystery solved.
4677180	4678500	All right, let's play Dungeons and Dragons.
4678780	4680780	All right, let's do it.
4680780	4682860	Aaron McGathey, will you please join us on stage?
4686420	4689300	And Carlos, once again, thank you for my beer, sir.
4689300	4689780	Is this legal?
4689780	4691460	Can I do this?
4691460	4692660	All right, perfect.
4692660	4695900	Carlos broke the law by bringing you the beer
4695900	4698740	because he's not eating while he's doing it.
4698740	4701660	Carlos has to have a pretzel in his hand in order to bring you the beer.
4702660	4709820	All right, so, Aaron, I never know how the show's going because I'm up here.
4709820	4712020	Did I bore people with my political and religious?
4712020	4714820	No, I thought it's a great show so far.
4714820	4716820	There's a lot of content and...
4716820	4719820	Four star review from my girlfriend.
4719820	4721820	I liked a whole lot.
4721820	4722820	I love the religious talk.
4722820	4723820	You know, my dad was a preacher.
4723820	4727820	My mom was a theology professor, so I love that stuff.
4727820	4729820	Is that what you're talking about?
4729820	4731820	I love that stuff.
4731820	4733820	Is that why I turn you on?
4733820	4737820	I mean, if you want to be gross, I think so, a little bit.
4737820	4739820	You're kind of a...
4739820	4741820	I was thinking about this a few nights ago.
4741820	4743820	You're kind of a preacher.
4743820	4745820	You're a fisher of men, a little bit.
4745820	4747820	I have a congregation.
4747820	4749820	Yeah, similar to my dad.
4749820	4751820	Yeah.
4753820	4755820	Does he smell like your dad?
4755820	4757820	No, the dicks taste the same.
4758820	4760820	Ba-da-ba, ba-da-ba.
4760820	4761820	Bread!
4761820	4763820	Bread.
4765820	4767820	They taste like focaccia.
4770820	4772820	No, no, no.
4772820	4774820	Shout out to my dad.
4774820	4775820	And his dick.
4775820	4778820	And his delicious, delicious clerical cock.
4779820	4780820	Wow.
4780820	4783820	Oh, so awful, so awful.
4783820	4785820	Sorry, Talitha.
4786820	4787820	No, it's nice.
4787820	4789820	You spent some time with my dad.
4789820	4792820	I have a really nice, wonderful, smart, very cool dad.
4793820	4795820	Sexy, strong...
4795820	4796820	He is cool.
4796820	4797820	Lies.
4798820	4799820	I went fishing with him.
4799820	4800820	He's a cool dude.
4800820	4801820	I like him.
4801820	4803820	On the bus, you said he had a bunch of Mormon jokes that he used to tell.
4803820	4805820	And then you texted him and he chickened out.
4805820	4807820	And he said, I never had any Mormon jokes.
4807820	4810820	He said, Aaron, I was just explaining Mormon theology to you.
4812820	4813820	That sounds weird.
4816820	4819820	I mean, if you find that funny, it's an eye of the beholder.
4819820	4820820	It's on you.
4820820	4823820	But I thought, you told me a story once about when your dad was a Navy chaplain.
4823820	4830820	He had a Scientology book in his office and somebody asked him what's going on.
4830820	4837820	And he said, I'm reading this because one of the seamen, one of my flock, is a Scientologist.
4837820	4844820	And he's reading all the Scientology books so that he can be a better chaplain to whoever's on board his ship.
4845820	4846820	That is fucking cool.
4846820	4847820	That's cooler than I would be.
4847820	4848820	I'd be like, what?
4848820	4849820	Come on.
4849820	4852820	I'd read the back of the book and I'd be like, okay.
4852820	4854820	That's the thing.
4854820	4857820	I really loved having Talith up there and talking about stuff.
4857820	4859820	We certainly didn't get to the bottom of the heavy...
4859820	4861820	That's a whole podcast we could do.
4861820	4862820	Yeah, absolutely.
4862820	4864820	But I was at a Box Brothers, a place where you mail stuff.
4864820	4867820	And I was standing behind a dude in Los Feliz in our neighborhood.
4867820	4870820	And he's a well-dressed, middle-aged guy.
4870820	4872820	Nice suit on.
4872820	4875820	Just clearly well-to-do-ish.
4875820	4877820	Life's been good to him.
4877820	4878820	He's mailing awesome stuff.
4878820	4882820	And he had a Scientology ring with a little S in the triangle or whatever.
4882820	4885820	And there was some big delay, so we're just kind of hanging out.
4885820	4887820	And he's kind of tapping his fingers and I notice the ring.
4887820	4889820	And I go, pardon me.
4889820	4891820	That ring, that's Scientology, right?
4891820	4894820	And he turns around like I just tried to take his wallet from him.
4894820	4896820	And it's really defensive.
4896820	4899820	This guy does not represent all Scientologists, certainly.
4899820	4901820	But he turned around and was incredible.
4901820	4905820	Almost like with the posture of instantly really defensive.
4905820	4907820	And I just kind of just pressed right past it.
4907820	4909820	I go, I live in this neighborhood.
4909820	4911820	There's all these Scientology buildings.
4911820	4912820	I've met Scientologists.
4912820	4914820	I don't know the first thing about it.
4914820	4918820	And he's like, he's really bummed out.
4918820	4920820	And he turned around like, can you not tell me about it?
4920820	4922820	Is that the thing?
4922820	4924820	He's like, what are you doing, man?
4924820	4926820	What are you doing?
4926820	4928820	I'm just asking about Scientology.
4928820	4930820	Is it off limits to know?
4930820	4932820	Because if it is, that's fucked up.
4932820	4935820	Well, to be fair, you're wearing a Guy Fox mask.
4935820	4937820	I said, to be fair, you're wearing a Guy Fox mask.
4937820	4940820	And later, husband.
4940820	4942820	And I was carrying a banjo.
4942820	4944820	So, you know, he had every reason to not trust me.
4944820	4948820	Also, he was buying a first aid kit and he was bleeding profusely from the...
4948820	4949820	Right, anyway.
4949820	4951820	The organization anonymous first aid kit.
4951820	4953820	If you can't be forthright about what it is you believe,
4953820	4955820	then I think you believe something stupid.
4955820	4959820	Maybe the man just murdered somebody and stole the ring and didn't know.
4959820	4963820	Exactly.
4963820	4965820	There should definitely be an open...
4965820	4968820	I think you've got to open your books with the religion, for sure.
4968820	4970820	Secret religion is a little sketchy.
4970820	4972820	I mean, maybe some things are stupid.
4972820	4974820	I'll tell you what's not stupid.
4974820	4976820	Something I take very seriously.
4976820	4978820	Dungeons and Dragons.
4980820	4982820	Spencer, bring us up to date, please.
4982820	4988820	On the last episode, our heroes were still within the depths of the Infinifish.
4988820	4991820	After falling out of a semi-destroyed lung,
4991820	4994820	the team dropped down to the circular chamber below.
4994820	4996820	After deciding to carry on,
4996820	5001820	they ran through the next sphincter into a large pink room with a large hanging organ in it.
5001820	5004820	Assaulting the organ with impunity,
5004820	5007820	the gang was soon accosted by lightning spidery creatures
5007820	5011820	and fighting those and destroying the organ was the work of a moment.
5011820	5015820	After destroying the organ, the group stood in a chamber.
5015820	5018820	A tangle of fleshy cords barring your path.
5018820	5021820	Behind you, the circular chamber you were just in.
5021820	5022820	Go.
5022820	5023820	Again.
5023820	5025820	I never thought I'd get the timing right on that.
5025820	5027820	That was amazing.
5027820	5030820	That's on a minute and 42 second track
5030820	5032820	and you managed to go right to the last second every time.
5032820	5034820	Yeah, that was orgasmic.
5034820	5036820	That was really good.
5036820	5038820	I'm looking like, come on, a sweat's dripping down my head.
5038820	5040820	Like, come on, you got four seconds, Spencer.
5040820	5042820	And you went, go.
5042820	5045820	Clip all these up for, like, my DJ demo reel.
5045820	5046820	Exactly.
5046820	5049820	Maybe you've heard this track enough or it's kind of cellular.
5049820	5052820	No, it's completely random every time.
5052820	5054820	Because I play a bit to walk you on.
5054820	5056820	I play a bit to bring Aaron up.
5056820	5058820	It's never the same thing twice.
5058820	5060820	I just marvel at your internal clock on that track.
5060820	5061820	It's shocking.
5061820	5063820	There's something about Spencer today on the bus.
5063820	5066820	If he ever wanted to start his own religion, now is the time.
5066820	5068820	It's a great city to do it in.
5068820	5071820	Have you guys heard of the fork knots?
5071820	5072820	The what?
5072820	5075820	They're little gremlins that cause all the world's problems.
5075820	5077820	I would like to...
5077820	5080820	I should have said this gigs ago,
5080820	5086820	but I really need a case for a Samsung Galaxy Note 2.
5086820	5089820	They break very easily and it's a very hard...
5089820	5092820	I can't find a case for it in any truck stop or Walmart.
5092820	5096820	And so if there was any time, any point where I wanted anyone
5096820	5098820	to think that I was a cult leader
5098820	5100820	that was worth giving gifts to,
5100820	5102820	if you're listening and you're in Portland...
5102820	5104820	Or San Francisco.
5104820	5105820	We're so far behind.
5105820	5106820	It won't drop.
5106820	5107820	It won't work.
5107820	5108820	It won't fucking work.
5108820	5110820	I should have done that in Brooklyn.
5110820	5112820	I should have been like, I need a fucking phone case.
5112820	5114820	Yeah, I told people I needed shoo-goo,
5114820	5116820	and my shoe has been repaired, baby.
5116820	5118820	The shoo-goo did the job.
5118820	5120820	Also, I never even met the person that gave the shoo-goo,
5120820	5122820	so thank you to whoever that was.
5122820	5123820	All right.
5123820	5125820	So, we're in a room with the...
5125820	5126820	What's that?
5127820	5129820	The smoke sticks...
5129820	5133820	We're in the lung of the Infinifish, we think,
5133820	5135820	and we use the smoke sticks...
5135820	5137820	To release acrid smoke into the lungs,
5137820	5139820	as well as igniting torches.
5139820	5140820	Right.
5140820	5142820	So we gave the Infinifish emphysema, right?
5142820	5143820	Right.
5143820	5145820	And then they slashed it to bits.
5145820	5147820	And then last night, we were in...
5147820	5149820	What we think is a kidney, we slashed it,
5149820	5151820	and it was talking about trying to give the Infinifish AIDS
5151820	5153820	and killing it that way.
5153820	5154820	But we didn't know how to...
5154820	5156820	I tried to summon an AIDS-ridden animal,
5156820	5158820	but I found out...
5158820	5162820	I can't summon animals, I can only speak to them, so...
5162820	5164820	What would be the noise for you
5164820	5166820	summoning an AIDS-ridden animal?
5166820	5167820	Ho-ho!
5167820	5169820	Yeah, here we go.
5169820	5170820	Yeah.
5170820	5172820	What do you think it's gonna be?
5172820	5173820	All right.
5173820	5174820	So, we have a...
5174820	5175820	Where are we at?
5175820	5178820	There's a thing barring our way with the fleshy cords?
5178820	5179820	Yeah, it's like...
5179820	5181820	If you imagine a large thicket,
5181820	5183820	but of fleshy ropes.
5183820	5184820	Is this through the third door?
5184820	5185820	Are we in the third...?
5185820	5186820	You're in the room with the organ.
5186820	5189820	If you went back a room, you'd be in that three-door room.
5189820	5190820	So...
5190820	5191820	Because we're...
5191820	5193820	As Dolly Parton would say, we're two doors down.
5193820	5194820	Two doors down?
5194820	5197820	We've killed the lung and the kidney,
5197820	5199820	and now we need to go back.
5199820	5201820	Presumably, or forward. I mean, either way.
5201820	5203820	I say to these guys,
5203820	5205820	I think we need to go back and go through that third door
5205820	5206820	and take out the third thing,
5206820	5208820	because this feels a lot like a video game
5208820	5210820	or an Irish joke.
5211820	5212820	All right.
5212820	5215820	Well, I take a swipe at the fleshy cords with my sword.
5215820	5217820	Several of them are not shattered.
5217820	5219820	You know, slice into ribbons.
5219820	5221820	It'll take a few more slices, but...
5221820	5224820	Can I just do a couple slices of slices?
5224820	5225820	Yeah.
5225820	5227820	Yeah, I just start hacking at the things.
5227820	5231820	Hacking at the things, you reveal a passageway.
5231820	5232820	That was easy.
5232820	5235820	See, sometimes just use your machete to get...
5235820	5237820	I charge headlong into the passageway.
5237820	5238820	Nice.
5239820	5241820	I've changed inside this infinifish
5241820	5244820	and on this tour and in this movie about the tour.
5244820	5246820	My character's changed. I've changed.
5246820	5248820	I've become cockier.
5248820	5249820	I've become...
5249820	5251820	You rush longer-winded?
5251820	5252820	Yeah.
5252820	5254820	More headlong and you're rushing?
5254820	5255820	Yeah.
5255820	5256820	All right.
5256820	5258820	Blasting through the opening,
5258820	5261820	you are met with what appears to be a slippery slope.
5261820	5263820	Your momentum carries you forward,
5263820	5264820	and you slide down the slope.
5264820	5266820	I remember that Aaron was in this room.
5267820	5270820	At the bottom of the slope is a large orangey-pink slime,
5270820	5271820	translucent and thick.
5271820	5272820	We're in the butt.
5272820	5275820	And inside the monster you can see a large tome.
5275820	5277820	It's thick and appears to be ancient
5277820	5279820	and it's covered in splatters of blood.
5279820	5281820	Inside the what?
5281820	5284820	There's a large blob of slime as of some sort of monster,
5284820	5287820	but on the inside is a large, ancient tome.
5287820	5292820	Okay, so that's probably one of the gelatinous monsters of some kind.
5292820	5295820	Yeah, you can see blood seeping out of the book
5295820	5297820	crawling into the mass of the slime,
5297820	5300820	branching out like butts and shoots from a branch.
5300820	5302820	The book calls to you.
5302820	5303820	We should join him.
5303820	5304820	The book calls to me?
5304820	5305820	Yeah.
5305820	5308820	You sense a longing for the book.
5308820	5316820	Valley high, valley high.
5316820	5320820	We are joined Sharpie, near the blood book.
5320820	5323820	You slide down the shaft and are joined with Sharpie.
5323820	5324820	I do likewise.
5324820	5328820	That happens also.
5328820	5330820	All right, let's start simple here.
5330820	5333820	I'm going to use my crossbow, which I never do.
5333820	5336820	Oh, it's kind of my thing.
5336820	5338820	I'm going to give to Mulrane,
5338820	5340820	who I assume has better archery skills than me.
5340820	5343820	I am carrying a thing called Melph's Acid Arrow.
5343820	5345820	That's actually a spell.
5345820	5346820	Oh, okay.
5346820	5348820	Never mind.
5348820	5349820	You can cast it, though.
5349820	5350820	Is that like Magic Missile?
5350820	5352820	Yeah, except it does acid damage
5352820	5355820	and there's a chance that it will do acid damage
5355820	5357820	later on like damage over time.
5357820	5358820	Yeah, okay.
5358820	5359820	I'm going to try that.
5359820	5360820	I'm going to try Melph's Acid Arrow
5360820	5362820	because it's an organic thing.
5362820	5363820	Melph's Acid Arrow?
5363820	5365820	No, not Milph.
5365820	5366820	Melph.
5366820	5367820	Melph.
5367820	5368820	He was a guy.
5368820	5371820	Summoning a green bolt of noxious acid.
5371820	5373820	You fire it directly at the blob.
5373820	5376820	Choctaw!
5376820	5381820	Choctaw!
5381820	5384820	Dealing eight damage.
5384820	5385820	All right, fine.
5385820	5388820	It's not great, but you'll take it.
5388820	5389820	You're not great.
5389820	5390820	What is, man?
5390820	5391820	You'll take it.
5391820	5394820	I just noticed that I have a sword.
5394820	5397820	Yeah, you have a longsword and you have weapon finesse,
5397820	5400820	which means you're actually quite a droid to the...
5400820	5401820	Is that the right word?
5401820	5404820	Fuck it.
5404820	5410820	I shoot two longswords.
5410820	5412820	Adventure.
5412820	5416820	Is that a joke?
5416820	5418820	It's not if you have to ask.
5418820	5420820	Then your bowstring would be sliced.
5420820	5423820	I think it's more of a bit.
5423820	5427820	I take the longsword and I...
5427820	5428820	Use it.
5428820	5430820	Use it.
5430820	5436820	I slice it towards the book.
5436820	5437820	Oh, well.
5437820	5439820	You got a critical hit.
5439820	5442820	Critical hit!
5442820	5447820	Slicing at the slime, your trigger sword leaves a clean mark along its surface.
5447820	5450820	I had someone tweet at me that I was really bad at Dungeons & Dragons.
5450820	5451820	I'm not disproving them.
5451820	5454820	Yeah, well, you're not allowed to be sensitive about that.
5454820	5455820	I'm not.
5455820	5456820	Dealing 13 damage.
5456820	5459820	You notice that the slime splits in half.
5459820	5460820	Yeah!
5460820	5462820	Fuck you, hazmat 46.
5462820	5468820	Both halves launch their attacks and miss.
5468820	5469820	Oh, nice.
5469820	5470820	We got lucky.
5470820	5472820	So now there's two halves of slime?
5472820	5474820	Two slimes remain.
5474820	5480820	Each is about half the size of the former slime that composed the two slimes.
5480820	5485820	The book is on the right hand slime.
5485820	5486820	I don't get it.
5486820	5493820	So we've passed the book on the right hand slime?
5493820	5494820	I'm confused.
5494820	5496820	This is making me think that I don't know what slime is.
5496820	5499820	Because the way that it's acting, I don't understand.
5499820	5500820	You don't know what swords are.
5500820	5504820	It's a large blob of a goop and acid that'll kill you.
5504820	5506820	Okay, I go into a...
5506820	5509820	What do you call it?
5509820	5511820	What's the one?
5511820	5512820	I do a power attack.
5512820	5513820	Power attack.
5513820	5514820	One, two, or three?
5514820	5515820	Two.
5515820	5516820	Two?
5516820	5517820	Yep.
5517820	5518820	You miss?
5518820	5519820	Shit.
5519820	5520820	Oh, I'm sorry.
5520820	5521820	That's stupid.
5521820	5522820	You hit.
5522820	5523820	Yeah!
5523820	5524820	Shit!
5524820	5525820	Slimes are really easy to hit.
5525820	5526820	All right.
5526820	5531820	It's going to be 17 damage.
5531820	5534820	17 damage, motherfuckers!
5534820	5539820	The remaining slime that you slash splits in half, forming two smaller slimes.
5539820	5540820	Son of a bitch!
5540820	5542820	So we're just making more slimes.
5542820	5543820	Yeah, you are.
5543820	5544820	Yep, they're smaller.
5544820	5545820	That's true.
5545820	5548820	Sharpie, this might be the wrong time to tell you, but...
5548820	5549820	Jesus Christ.
5549820	5550820	My thoughts exactly present.
5550820	5551820	No, I'm sorry.
5551820	5552820	No, I agree.
5553820	5556820	You spoke my thoughts.
5556820	5560820	The slimes lurch towards you and strike both Sharpie and Maureen with a pseudopod.
5560820	5564820	Hey, Maureen, now's a good time to check in with your boyfriend.
5564820	5566820	I'll be over here kicking ass.
5566820	5569820	She's going to say I'm very proud of you, that's all.
5574820	5577820	The two of you take 11 acid damage.
5577820	5578820	Oh, man.
5578820	5580820	I see colors.
5583820	5585820	I can always see colors.
5585820	5588820	I see more, I see more.
5588820	5590820	I smell them.
5591820	5593820	A quick sidebar, DM.
5593820	5594820	Go for it.
5594820	5596820	Mending, the spell mending.
5596820	5599820	Can repair a lightly damaged object.
5600820	5602820	Do you want to stick the slime back together?
5602820	5604820	If there's a hole in a boat, that's what that's for.
5604820	5607820	Or if you sat on your watch.
5608820	5611820	Do you know what time it is when I sit on my watch?
5611820	5613820	Dare box time.
5613820	5615820	Time to get a new watch, motherfucker.
5615820	5617820	Oh, damn.
5617820	5620820	Do I gain hit points from that awesome joke?
5621820	5623820	No.
5624820	5625820	Whose turn is it?
5625820	5626820	My turn?
5626820	5627820	Yeah.
5628820	5632820	Yes, I was thinking maybe for a second if I use mending to mend the...
5632820	5635820	If you'd like to, that might make sense.
5636820	5638820	It's really easy to repair a slime.
5638820	5640820	You just kind of smash it back together.
5644820	5646820	It's like an asteroid.
5646820	5648820	Why would you want to remake a big asteroid?
5648820	5650820	Because it's easier to dodge a large one.
5652820	5654820	I'm hearing that I should try this.
5654820	5655820	Go for it.
5655820	5658820	I cast mending on two of these smaller slimes.
5658820	5661820	Two of the slimes coalesce into a larger form.
5661820	5665820	However, that final form seems to be smaller than the sum of the two slime masses.
5667820	5668820	It's like math.
5668820	5670820	Non-Euclidean geometry.
5673820	5677820	Spencer, may I use alchemist's fire in the slime?
5678820	5683820	Hurling a bag of alchemist's fire, you strike the blob directly in its center of mass.
5684820	5687820	Dealing seven fire damage.
5687820	5689820	The blob's now on fire.
5690820	5691820	Which one did you do?
5691820	5693820	The one with the book or the one without the book?
5693820	5694820	The slime?
5694820	5696820	Yeah, there's two slimes at this point.
5696820	5698820	Which would be better?
5698820	5699820	Don't burn the book.
5699820	5700820	I don't want to burn the book.
5700820	5701820	Okay, cool.
5701820	5703820	That slime dies.
5703820	5705820	Only one half slime is remaining.
5705820	5706820	The one with the book?
5706820	5707820	The one with the book.
5707820	5709820	Flaming sword!
5709820	5711820	Don't burn the book.
5712820	5715820	You can extinguish the flames on your sword if you'd like.
5715820	5718820	I extinguish the flames on my flaming sword!
5720820	5722820	Now it's just a sword!
5722820	5723820	That's a closet sword.
5723820	5724820	Yeah.
5725820	5727820	It's a straight acting sword.
5728820	5729820	Yeah, it's very butch.
5729820	5730820	Closet sword.
5730820	5731820	Yeah, it's a bear sword.
5731820	5733820	It's shirts with sleeves now.
5734820	5737820	You slice the book slime and it splits in half.
5737820	5739820	But it also takes 17 damage.
5739820	5742820	It appears to be on the ropes.
5742820	5744820	How's the book?
5744820	5746820	The book's cool, it's fine.
5750820	5751820	Magic missile.
5751820	5754820	I cast magic missile at the slime so as not to hurt the book.
5754820	5756820	I'm going to resolve slime attacks first.
5756820	5757820	Yeah, resolve them.
5757820	5758820	Good luck with that.
5758820	5762820	Quark, you take 11 damage.
5762820	5764820	Where's that put my hit points at?
5764820	5765820	You should have been at full.
5765820	5768820	I don't think you got hit from any of the spider things.
5768820	5769820	I took a little bit of damage.
5769820	5770820	I think I took like 7 or something.
5770820	5772820	I think 7 from the lightning spider.
5772820	5775820	So 7 and 11 would put you somewhere around 22.
5775820	5776820	This is so exciting.
5776820	5777820	It really is.
5778820	5780820	I'm riveted.
5780820	5783820	Sharpie takes 5 damage.
5791820	5794820	Okay, so you're casting magic missile.
5796820	5798820	I'm just going to play by myself.
5801820	5803820	I got a magic missile.
5804820	5806820	Have faith that we'll return to you, Spencer.
5807820	5810820	I think it's funny if I act like that, it's just a joke.
5812820	5814820	But were you going to cast magic missile?
5814820	5817820	Yeah, at the book wielding slime.
5817820	5820820	Firing your magic missiles, they strike true.
5820820	5822820	It takes 7 damage.
5823820	5824820	It's dead.
5825820	5827820	The slime evaporates.
5827820	5830820	You see the book remaining, resting on the fleshy ground.
5830820	5832820	Step back, magic expert.
5833820	5837820	I go to the book, I examine it with my magical eyes.
5838820	5843820	It appears to be written in some sort of red ink, or maybe blood.
5843820	5845820	It's actually a language you don't recognize.
5845820	5850820	However, you still seem to feel the power and energy emanating from this book.
5850820	5851820	Does it feel evil?
5851820	5857820	It feels, not evil, but definitely dark, definitely the power of death.
5857820	5858820	I touch it.
5858820	5859820	You touch it.
5861820	5862820	It's a book, right?
5863820	5866820	It feels slightly damp with blood.
5866820	5870820	As you touch it, a bit of blood seeps out of the book onto the ground.
5870820	5872820	Open it up and check it out, man.
5872820	5875820	I open up to the inside front cover.
5875820	5877820	The inside front cover.
5877820	5879820	That's the fly leaf.
5880820	5882820	It's covered in blood.
5885820	5887820	I open up to a random page in the middle.
5887820	5891820	It seems to be written in red script that you don't recognize.
5891820	5894820	It's definitely an old language of some sort.
5894820	5899820	It's definitely not abyssal or any other sort of demonic language as far as you can tell.
5899820	5900820	Is it gnome or dwarven?
5900820	5902820	It is not gnome or dwarven.
5902820	5903820	Yeah, no.
5906820	5908820	I detect magic on it.
5908820	5909820	It is intensely magical.
5909820	5911820	Intensely magic.
5911820	5914820	Do our little magical shards have any effect on this sort of thing?
5914820	5916820	I whip out a shard.
5917820	5919820	You whip out a shard.
5920820	5922820	We all whip our shards out.
5924820	5926820	We compare shard length.
5928820	5931820	I only bring out enough shard to win.
5932820	5935820	I pull my leaf skirt down for no reason.
5936820	5937820	Okay.
5939820	5941820	The shards have no reaction.
5942820	5946820	I approach the book and see if I can read it.
5946820	5948820	I cling to it tightly.
5948820	5949820	Okay.
5950820	5951820	Act it out then.
5953820	5956820	Don't be snatching my book.
5957820	5958820	Baby.
5958820	5959820	Baby, baby.
5959820	5960820	I don't want to snatch it.
5960820	5961820	I'm just trying to help.
5961820	5963820	Look with your eyes, not with your hands.
5965820	5966820	Fine.
5966820	5967820	I look with my eyes.
5968820	5970820	You look with your eyes.
5971820	5972820	You see a book.
5972820	5975820	It appears ancient and old and thick and musty.
5975820	5977820	Can I read the language?
5977820	5978820	You cannot read the language.
5978820	5982820	I say we take the book and find somebody who can speak this language.
5982820	5984820	What are the exits available to us, Spencer?
5984820	5987820	Right now you can only see a sphincter on the floor.
5987820	5988820	Yeah.
5988820	5990820	Perfect spot to end, I think.
5990820	5991820	Yeah.
5991820	5992820	Butthole cliffhanger.
5992820	5995820	Looking at a sphincter.
5997820	5998820	Thank you so much.
5998820	6000820	Erin McGathey, everyone.
6002820	6003820	Swordmaster.
6003820	6005820	Erin, are you selling merchandise out there?
6006820	6007820	Oh, I'm so glad you asked.
6007820	6010820	Spencer and I will be selling merchandise downstairs.
6010820	6013820	T-shirts, one for 15, two for 25.
6013820	6016820	Free smiles, free hugs, lots of love.
6016820	6017820	Stay true to yourself.
6017820	6027820	And depending on what time it is, so far I have yet to be unable to stay until I've signed every single thing that people buy.
6027820	6031820	So we may break that record here because we have to leave.
6031820	6033820	I say we're getting close to wrapping this thing up here.
6033820	6034820	Oh, of course.
6034820	6035820	I'm not saying.
6035820	6037820	I mean, I don't want to talk about politics and religion for another 40 minutes.
6037820	6039820	I just mean, I don't know what time it is.
6039820	6042820	It feels like we did a four-hour show in a good way.
6042820	6043820	It's 9-10.
6044820	6045820	Chicken noodle deck.
6045820	6047820	Chicken noodle deck.
6047820	6051820	Chicken noodle deck and a can for you.
6052820	6061820	There's a sip of some hearty broth and your lips will froth at the taste of it, my friend.
6062820	6064820	Chicken noodle deck.
6064820	6066820	Chicken noodle deck and a can for you.
6066820	6068820	It's nice and thick.
6069820	6071820	Let's sing the chicken noodle deck song.
6071820	6075820	You guys, but we didn't sing it in last night's show in, where were we, Kansas City?
6075820	6076820	Denver.
6076820	6077820	Denver.
6077820	6078820	We sang it in the last...
6078820	6079820	It's all the same.
6080820	6082820	Here I am.
6082820	6085820	Ain't got a deck, got a chicken noodle can.
6085820	6090820	All my life, I've been put in my can to sign my chicken noodle wife.
6090820	6093820	Chicken noodle god, come down from the mountains, same.
6093820	6095820	Chicken noodle man, you gotta work all day.
6095820	6098820	Chicken noodle man, you gotta cross the river, Jordan.
6098820	6100820	Feed the devil soup until your troubles go away.
6100820	6103820	Soup to the bowl, bowl to the spoon.
6103820	6105820	Spoon to the mouth, you're gonna get well soon.
6105820	6108820	You gotta get some rest and sleep till noon.
6108820	6111820	Grab a couple coffee then, head to the saloon, singin'.
6111820	6113820	Chicken noodle god, come down from the mountains, same.
6113820	6115820	Chicken noodle man, you gotta work all day.
6115820	6118820	Chicken noodle man, you gotta cross the river, Jordan.
6118820	6120820	Feed the devil soup until your troubles go away.
6120820	6123820	Well, the wind blows south and come what may.
6123820	6126820	My chicken noodle wife, let me just the other day.
6126820	6128820	There's not much else I can do but pray.
6128820	6131820	My chicken noodle man, I gotta work all day.
6131820	6134820	Chicken noodle god, come down from the mountains, same.
6134820	6136820	Chicken noodle man, you gotta work all day.
6136820	6139820	Chicken noodle man, you gotta cross the river, Jordan.
6139820	6144820	Feed the devil soup until your troubles go away.
6145820	6148820	Very spiritual in Salt Lake City.
6148820	6153820	It's a town, it's a half Mormon, half secular town.
6153820	6156820	Half drunk, half sober.
6156820	6159820	It makes for good mythology.
6159820	6164820	It's like a battery is powerful because it has opposing charges
6164820	6166820	and they're trying to get to each other.
6166820	6173820	You can turn that into an alarm clock waking you up for your job at Verizon.
6173820	6178820	Wait, that's the wrong one. I want to try the other one.
6178820	6180820	Yeah, but I should do some rapping.
6180820	6182820	I should do some fucking hardcore rapping.
6182820	6183820	You wanna do a little rapping?
6183820	6185820	I gotta. I gotta.
6185820	6188820	It's not because I want to, it's because they deserve it.
6188820	6191820	Yeah, the people cry out for what they want.
6191820	6194820	I don't want to look anyone in the eye tonight that says,
6194820	6196820	you didn't rap, I brought my daughter.
6196820	6200820	You didn't rap. You didn't rap.
6201820	6203820	I don't know if you guys have been listening to the podcast,
6203820	6206820	but I've been getting really good.
6206820	6210820	And the bar can't be raised high enough.
6210820	6213820	Let's put the money where your mouth is, man.
6213820	6214820	I'm not afraid.
6214820	6217820	Yo, yo, yo, yo.
6217820	6219820	So far so good, man.
6219820	6220820	Yo, yo.
6220820	6222820	Went to a lake and its name was Salt.
6222820	6225820	The fucking mama's real hard, but it wasn't my fault.
6225820	6228820	She came onto me and it wasn't me.
6228820	6231820	I told her, eat my doo-doo and drink my pee.
6231820	6233820	And she did.
6233820	6235820	So I fucked her.
6235820	6239820	She did her part. I did mine.
6239820	6240820	Your mama's so fine.
6240820	6244820	I went down to meet her in the Salt mine.
6244820	6246820	Here in Utah, that's what they do.
6246820	6250820	They dig deep and pull it out and give it to the world for truth.
6250820	6253820	Come on down to Harmentown.
6253820	6254820	Salt.
6254820	6256820	Turn that frown upside down.
6256820	6257820	Chloride.
6257820	6259820	Hello, goop is brown.
6259820	6260820	Sodium.
6260820	6262820	Turn that down to Harmentown.
6262820	6264820	A simple seasoning right on your table.
6264820	6268820	But is it that simple or did Cain slay Abel?
6268820	6271820	It's a biblical town, but a different Bible.
6271820	6273820	And an Indian found a book.
6273820	6276820	Is that libel to cause confusion?
6276820	6278820	There's three books.
6278820	6280820	If you're under, we're going to get you dirty looks.
6280820	6282820	If it's magical, don't be tragical.
6282820	6284820	Just communicate like that chick did,
6284820	6288820	and everyone will be fine like a fraggle.
6288820	6290820	It kind of rhymes.
6290820	6292820	One more time with the chorus.
6292820	6295820	Come on down to Harmentown, Utah.
6295820	6297820	Turn that frown upside down.
6297820	6299820	Mama.
6299820	6301820	Hello, poop is brown.
6301820	6302820	Papa.
6302820	6304820	Come on down to Harmentown.
6304820	6309820	United States made of all different worlds.
6309820	6312820	Boys and girls, go in Christmas shopping.
6312820	6316820	Fuck your mama so hard that her sitties were sloppin'
6316820	6318820	out of her shirt onto the floor.
6318820	6321820	And I scooped them up and said, you need these and more.
6321820	6323820	You need to take care of yourself.
6323820	6325820	Be a good mother.
6325820	6326820	Go home.
6326820	6327820	Raise all my sisters and brothers.
6327820	6329820	Be a proud woman.
6329820	6330820	Get a career.
6330820	6333820	Don't keep fucking me, Dan Harmon, standing here.
6333820	6334820	Just the Mormons.
6334820	6336820	Come on down to Harmentown.
6336820	6337820	Tabernacle.
6337820	6339820	Turn that frown upside down.
6339820	6341820	Even ex-Mormons.
6341820	6343820	Yellow poop is brown.
6343820	6344820	Ex-Mormons.
6344820	6346820	Come on down to Harmentown.
6346820	6348820	Fleeing from my Mormon faith.
6348820	6351820	It was so constricted, I just had to escape.
6351820	6354820	It was like Jehovah's Witness and Scientologists.
6354820	6357820	I grew up under it and couldn't handle it.
6357820	6360820	And everything your parents tell you, you got to do the opposite.
6360820	6363820	But every time you stand back, you might come back to it.
6363820	6365820	Because it really doesn't matter what you pray to.
6365820	6366820	It's all ghosts.
6366820	6369820	It's just as relevant as what you put on your toast.
6369820	6370820	Some people put jam.
6370820	6372820	Some people put jelly.
6372820	6373820	I listen to Tori Amos.
6373820	6375820	Some people listen to Belly.
6375820	6378820	They're both old bands from the 90s.
6378820	6379820	You're all 25.
6379820	6380820	I'm sorry then.
6380820	6382820	I dated myself.
6382820	6385820	Come on down to Harmentown.
6385820	6387820	Turn that frown upside down.
6387820	6389820	You could have said R Kelly.
6389820	6390820	You could have said R Kelly.
6390820	6392820	You could have said Nelly.
6392820	6393820	Jeff.
6393820	6394820	Yo.
6394820	6395820	Yo.
6395820	6396820	We had a good time tonight.
6396820	6398820	We had a girl that was Mormon, came up on the stairs,
6398820	6400820	and her hair was ghostly white.
6400820	6402820	She had presumably white undergarments on.
6402820	6404820	The protector from evil.
6404820	6408820	I hope she doesn't get attacked by a bull weevil that eats up holes
6408820	6410820	and lets in a pocket of sin.
6410820	6412820	I know that Mormonism, the tabernacle,
6412820	6415820	or something, I'd like to get in and check it out just for a while.
6415820	6418820	I think that maybe Brigham Young could make me smile.
6418820	6421820	Come on down to Harmentown.
6421820	6424820	Spencer's coming up down the upside down.
6424820	6425820	D.M.
6425820	6427820	He's got a poof in his brow.
6427820	6430820	Ratmaster down to Harmentown.
6430820	6432820	My name's Spencer and I'm on the mic.
6432820	6435820	I used to play volleyball so I know how to spike.
6435820	6438820	We just came out here to Salt Lake City.
6438820	6441820	It's the saltiest place to suck your mama's titty.
6441820	6444820	It's a lot of fun to be up here, I admit.
6444820	6448820	I think that you all should just submit to my will.
6448820	6453820	Just start all listening to me and everybody doesn't even have to be free.
6453820	6455820	After all, my slaves.
6455820	6457820	Come on down to Harmentown.
6457820	6459820	Thank you Salt Lake City.
6459820	6461820	Thank you very much, everybody.
6461820	6463820	He is yellow, poof is brown.
6463820	6466820	Thank you, Deuce, for coming up down to Harmentown.
6466820	6468820	Craig, good luck with your job back in Wisconsin,
6468820	6470820	or back in Los Angeles, right, and stuff.
6470820	6472820	Talitha, our Mormon representative.
6472820	6473820	Thank you, wise guys.
6473820	6475820	Let's all go out, meet downstairs, get some merchandise,
6475820	6477820	have a drink, and say, hey, oh, we can't have a drink.
6477820	6479820	It's illegal here.
6479820	6482820	Thank you, Aaron McGathey, Spencer Crittenden.
6482820	6483820	Yes.
6483820	6485820	One more time for the mayor of Harmentown.
6485820	6487820	Dan Harmon, everybody.
6487820	6489820	God bless you.
6489820	6491820	Whatever God that may be.
6491820	6494820	I'm going to walk around with my beer in my hand.
6494820	6496820	Don't do it, Jeff, don't do it.
6496820	6502820	I'm going to walk to the green room with a beer in my hand.
6502820	6505820	Come on down to Harmentown.
6505820	6508820	This is the sad part of the song.
6508820	6511820	He is yellow, poop is brown.
6511820	6514820	Come on down to Harmentown.
6541820	6544820	Come on down to Harmentown.
