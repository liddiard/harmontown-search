0	26640	The
26640	50440	Mr. Dan Hoeber. Mr. Jefferson Davis. I never do that. I never I never do that. You didn't know
50440	54520	that I was the president of the Confederate States? Whole shows go by and I never actually go. Jeff
54520	59280	Davis, by the way, people should do that. I think it's kind of implied, isn't it? Isn't
59280	64600	that a little implicit? I did. You're thinking very healthy. No, I think I don't come to
64600	68200	Harmentown because I want the notoriety. Otherwise I would be standing on stage and
68200	74960	hiding behind a giant Buick sized. Hey, I don't come to Harmentown for the notoriety either.
74960	83960	Why did you name it Harmentown? I couldn't. I'm mad at names. Like I, everything I came up with
83960	93440	was taken. I wanted to call it Scott Ockerman's, uh, Palooza. I tried. I tried calling it at one
93440	104840	point. Um, um, uh, uh, what's Kevin Pollock town? But then I was like, yeah, you guys are best
104840	111400	friends, aren't you? I don't like him anymore. I don't like Kevin Pollock. Let the feud begin.
111400	118080	All right. Uh, all right. So, uh, I got nothing. I didn't write anything in my phone. Then Dan,
118240	126040	I will take it as comptroller upon myself to, uh, to tell you that today was a big day in sports. Oh,
126040	131600	oh, oh. So we're going to do an old fashioned, uh, was it today, the super bowl? Yes, it was.
131600	138120	And I was surrounded by guys on the set cause I was shooting today. And as, as we all know,
138120	143920	everyone in the crew is into football and then the actors aren't, but then the crew is like,
143920	148360	was walking around going like, don't tell me, don't shut up. Don't tell me because they're all
148360	161320	DVR-ing the game. Did they tell you anything? How much? I don't know. Throw balls, throw balls
161320	166800	around. When you throw balls, you get to get around. Oh, it's good to throw balls. It's good
166800	174520	to invest in your body. It's, it's a good thing to do because everybody knows that's what makes
174520	180320	you happy because look at life and look at history. Everyone that's physically superior always ends
180320	188720	up being unexploited and happy and rich and in control of other people. I'll say, I, I cut that
188720	198640	off. Oh wait, it's the other way around. Should we start again? Actually, it's, uh, yeah, you do
198640	213240	more, the more synapse you do, the closer you get to being a slate. A fate I wouldn't wish on
213240	217960	anyone. But hey, if it's going to happen to someone, it might as well be an idiot. Our timing is up.
217960	230360	Hey, get to the bottom of this. Okay. Hey, there's Dan Harmon. He's dirty and he's in the corner
230360	236160	minding his own business. Let's pick on him because obviously football isn't that fulfilling
236160	241320	because we have free time to pick on people. Let's go pick on him. What do you have to say,
241320	248800	Dan? Why don't you throw a football? I don't think it's very important. I don't think it's
248800	256640	important. Well, we think you're wrong. Well, I'm willing to bet my fucking life on it and yours
256640	262640	without moving a muscle. Well, we're not willing to risk anything, but we're going to punch you.
262640	272600	I'll see you in seven years, you piece of shit. Seven years later. Okay, I'm still a nerd and I
272600	281560	don't have any money. Ten years after that. Aha, gotcha. I'm a PA and basic table. All right.
281560	295000	Okay, great. I don't have my iPad, Dan. I'm going off the phone now and it's a little harder to
295000	299200	operate. So you're going to have to deal with a little sloppy or controlling music wise. Listen,
299200	306560	I got drunk today too. I was drinking all day today. But you were working. I know. You're
306560	317160	drinking on the set? Yeah. It's called functional alcoholism. That's my gig, baby. But I am a little
317160	322880	softer on the edge. It's a little sloppy. Don't deflect from the fact that we are now in Sports
322880	327280	Corner proper. Oh shit, shit, shit, shit. Okay, so you know what? Do the theme. What? God damn it.
327280	337800	Okay. From the beginning. Yeah, but this is off the phone. Okay, here we go. From the top. Sports
337800	350880	Corner. Oh, yeah. Vonnegut Picasso, Tom Hanks, who knows who they are. Hey, but what about that?
351480	363720	Brett Favre. So Dan, off the top here, let's just come straight out. Did you think the best team
363720	370800	won today? First off. Obviously, Jeff, the beautiful thing about football and the reason why
370800	377120	everyone loves it so much is that the best team always wins. That's the point of football is it's
377120	384080	a metric of worth. We spend our days wandering around the city streets not knowing if we'd
384080	391880	succeeded or failed. And then we only in these arenas can we see, oh, I got a first down. I'm
391880	399200	a better person than the guy that only got a second down. And if I get enough first downs,
399320	407120	I can get a touchdown. And then I get a Rose Bowl. And if I get three Rose Bowls, I put them in a
407120	417040	Super Bowl. And then I really eat all the Rose Bowls. Because I'm so powerful. I'm such a powerful
417040	425160	person. Are you a coach or a player in this? I'm just a general fan of everything athletic. I think
425160	432360	it's a great way to spend your time. When I was in kindergarten, they tried to hold me back for a
432360	438480	grade because I didn't know how to walk on a balance beam. And what? And you know what? I
438480	447760	applaud their scrutiny because I'm famous for my balance. I've always felt not only am I but so
447760	464440	many are. Beethoven, Einstein, Steve Jobs. Boy, they're like cats. I mean, we're in turmoil as a
464440	470160	culture. Where do we where do we fucking cut this shit off and like make a moonraker colony? Balance.
470160	481960	So the Broncos were favored by six points. You know, but who did you think was gonna win? The
481960	488640	Panthers? Patriots were already out of it because they had already lost. Yeah, this guy lost his
488640	499360	shoulder. And then of course there were those rape charges. That's a pretty good guess on my part.
499360	509160	You're talking about the New England Cosby's. Okay, so it was the Patriots versus the Broncos.
509160	514440	No, no versus the Panthers. Panthers versus Broncos. New England Panthers. Carolina Panthers.
514440	521040	Carolina Panthers. Which Carolina? I think North. North Carolina Panthers. All right. Okay,
521040	527680	the North Carolina Panthers in full representation of the North Carolina lifestyle. Absolutely
527680	533880	separating themselves from that bullshit Southern Carolina by virtue of the Panther.
533880	543200	They're state cat. I think they did a great job today. Moving the ball. Okay,
543200	547360	now look, let's be honest. You don't care for sports so much, but I know that you do love
547360	552880	entertainment. You are known to be quite an arbiter of what is and what is not entertainment.
552880	558800	And I thought the Black Eyed Peas and Sean Penn did a great job. Halftime. You're closer than you
558800	567640	know. You're quick. I was amazed when Gallagher came out with his head had been surgically
567640	575040	reattached to Anthony Bourdain. They opened up. They came out. It started with Coldplay. You know,
575040	582520	you know, the most exciting band of all time. Is this a tribute to concussions and people
582640	589720	who have suffered so much head trauma that like Coldplay is more their speed now. Then,
589720	594680	I believe it was Bruno Mars and company came out and they're like, they fucking whip ass. There
594680	599040	was a bunch of dudes in the same suit and they're doing like Michael Jackson, James Brown moves.
599040	605040	And then Beyonce comes up, but still there's a Coldplay out on stage. There's a Coldplay out on
605040	612160	stage. Beyonce was like tripping over him. Oh, the single ladies. What the fuck? There's a Coldplay.
612800	617560	I missed it because I was leaving. I left the game during halftime. So I didn't see it,
617560	622640	but I heard that there was a thing where Beyonce almost fell over on stage and people were already
622640	627920	online talking about Beyonce almost wiped out on stage. So I looked at it. Yes, Beyonce almost
627920	634920	wiped out. She's wearing what I can only describe as a leather one-piece swimsuit with Michael
634920	641840	Jackson braids and epaulettes on it. And like it was pretty, pretty good and pretty sexy. And then
641840	647440	she kind of did a little stumble backwards and in high ass platform heels, she caught herself,
647440	653920	jumped back and jumped up and hit the beat with every other dancer behind it. She couldn't even
653920	657840	see. So if anybody's trying to talk shit about her almost wipe out, I was like, no,
657840	663000	not only did she almost wipe out, she proved that she's in better shape than anybody else. Yeah,
663000	668960	that was amazing. I think she'll be fine. I think she will. TR wise, I have a feeling that's not
668960	673680	going to dig her. If she fell on her ass and tipped over the side and like kicked the person
673680	680960	in the face by accident, that would be, I think, I think, I think with Bay, as I call her, she'd
680960	687880	have to do more than that to start to suffer a Q rating. She'd have to, as she kicked up, her shoe
687880	705560	would have to hit the new twin towers. I was gonna say like a prematurely born baby. And then
705560	711000	land on the baby. And I remember like, oh, and then she'd have to stand up and say, no, no,
711000	718200	let him take it like a man. And the parents would be like, no, but Beyonce, we want to just
718200	724680	lift the shoe relative to this baby, developing baby. She's like, if he was born, he can live.
724680	732480	And if he dies, he didn't deserve to be born. And then that, I think people would be like,
732480	738720	hashtag, like maybe Beyonce, maybe not. There might be a backlash. But also,
738720	742440	like if she went like that, all the single ladies, and then she went like this and it said like,
742440	753520	Christ lives. It's like on her breasts. But she gained some fans, but lose more. I feel like
753520	761880	anybody that brings a preemie to a Super Bowl halftime celebration. If Beyonce brought up,
761880	766760	she was like, all the single ladies, all the single ladies, all the single ladies, all the
766760	772000	single ladies, when you're a single lady, you want a man and you don't want to vaccinate your kid.
772000	780320	And then she brings out a kid, like a four-year-old kid, and there's a giant hypodermic needle. And
780320	785560	then there's a certificate of vaccination with no signature on it. And then it was like in the inner
785560	791440	side, she goes, all the single ladies, what's your name, ma'am? Margaret Dawson from Montana. All the
791440	796160	single ladies, what's your name, sir? Bob Dawson. All the single ladies, all the single ladies. And
796160	800840	you're here to vaccinate your kid? Yes. All the single ladies. Well, I'm here to talk you out of it.
800840	809800	Make it to the bop, put it to the stop, put it on the flap, top, top. But we really want to vaccinate
809800	815200	her kid. And she's like, I don't care. I'm not letting you. And then she like kicks the giant
815200	821040	needle and it breaks. And all the vaccination goes into the football field. And she's like,
821040	828480	that's where it belongs, in the dirt. Don't vaccinate your kids. And then Jim Carrey and Jenny
828480	839480	McCarthy drop down on parachutes. Wait, what's their mission? Support. Well, I thought they were
839480	843720	like threshold guardians where they're going to say no. Oh God, no, no, no. They're all into it.
843720	849200	I mean, in this world where Beyonce suffers a little bit from the halftime show. If none of
849200	856240	that happened, I think she'll be fine. I think she will be fine. Janet Jackson, however, one titty
856240	864760	from infamy. Show her nipple. She rolled the dice. She paid the piper. Not the price that we could,
864760	873200	the piper knows what the price is. Does the piper not like to rhyme things? I don't pay the piper.
874200	883040	I'm sorry. All right. Well, put a pin in it. I never pay the price. I pay the piper for the piper
883040	892480	knows what the price is. I let the piper handle my money. You're not at that stage yet. It's the
892480	899480	worst show ever, if you're just tuning in. I think this is still a thing you tune into, right?
899480	904240	People are probably flipping podcasts right now. Can you flip? I guess you can flip. I think
904240	909320	you're flipping between Kevin Pollak and this. But what people don't know is that we have a
909320	914320	cavalcade of stars here tonight. Oh yeah, no shortage. You and I could start off as clumsily
914320	920480	as we possibly could. This show will succeed based on the energy of the rocket fuel that we
920480	926960	have in the booster, which I call the green room. Let's start out. Let's make a new friend in
926960	934160	Hollywood. Let's talk to our new friend. She's here. You may recognize her from the recent hit
934160	941760	Family in Peace. God damn it. I don't watch TV anymore. Life in pieces. Go fuck yourself America.
941760	948760	No, she's wonderful. We're going to talk to her about life and acting. Please welcome Zoey
948760	967680	Lister Jr. Jones. We need to take 10 minutes to talk about what I just did. Hello, Zoey Lister
967680	974680	Jr. I like that a lot better than my name. Is it tiny Lister Jr. That's the guy that's like the
974680	982600	Zeus guy that like he does the pecs like, uh, it's an eighties thing. Zoey Lister Jr. How's your
982600	993720	dad? The infamous Zoey Lister. Zoey Lister Jones. Yeah. Don't confuse me. I'm tiny Lister Jones. All
993720	997640	right. Here's the next thing I'm going to get wrong. The most recent project that you've done
997640	1003000	is this movie and it's called consumed. Very good. Nailed it. Nailed it. Called it consumption eight
1003080	1010200	times. Yeah. I'm busy. I'm a workaholic. I don't know nothing about nothing. Which is the combination
1010200	1016200	of being an alcoholic who works. Yeah. The workaholic covers the scent of the alcohol.
1017000	1019640	People are like, well, he's getting shit done. He can't be that drunk.
1022040	1029800	Yeah. Consumed is it's a horror movie. It's a dramatic thriller, but it has some horrifying
1029800	1034040	elements. It takes place in the world of genetically modified organism. Is this something
1034040	1039080	that you wrote or you're acting in? I, I co-wrote it with my husband and co-produced it and, uh, and
1039080	1044520	yeah, act in it. Wow. Yeah. You're a workaholic. Do you also drink or are you just? I don't drink.
1044520	1049000	But you just work a lot. I work a lot. That's good. I vape. Do you not drink? You could. You're
1049000	1054760	a faithaholic because you used to or because people that raised you did. Um, no, uh, well,
1054760	1061880	I did used to people who raised me also did. Um, but I just prefer that vape life. I don't know.
1063560	1067240	It's better for your skin. It's better. It makes it less puffy. Yeah, less puffy.
1067240	1073720	I'm turning into chatter. There's no hangovers. Like I, once you notice it, it's too late of
1073720	1078360	like, Oh, I drank for 40 years. Like it's not like you could be like, Oh, I'm going to now start
1078360	1083240	eating, uh, wheat thins. Yeah. There's no reverse. I like that in this day and age wheat thins are
1083240	1089080	like the healthiest thing you can think of. Wheat thins for me are like dessert.
1091240	1094680	All right. It's not a competition.
1096040	1103480	Zoe, when you are, when you're living that vape life, uh, do you not get the munchies and want
1103480	1110200	a snack? I do. I do. But you know, I, um, I keep all wheat thins out of my house. The wheat thins
1110200	1118600	are, I don't think wheat thins are even in production anymore. They absolutely are. And
1118600	1122600	I know that they're not healthy, but there is a holdover from the eighties culture where there
1122600	1129480	was such a thing as I was like, yeah, it was like the font suggested health. I know. It's
1129480	1136680	like beautiful radiant. There's like wheat, like there's the stock of wheat. And then the other
1136680	1142200	word is thin. You could do that in the eighties and people would just be like, look, this is a
1142200	1149160	good faith agreement. Like why, why would a box lie to me? Did wheat thins have like the pictures
1149160	1154440	on the back with all the different like toppings you could, oh, that was Triscuits. Oh, those were
1154440	1159880	really nasty. Yeah. No, wheat thins were delicious. Triscuits are better than wheat. They're both good.
1159880	1177160	I like Triscuits. Well, Triscuits are fucking garbage. Oh, we chapped into something.
1178280	1180600	Yeah. Well, I think he's new platform.
1183960	1187320	He's got the youth. All right. So, so when you're being a sensible vape snacker,
1188280	1196280	what do you munch on? Oh, oh, a variety of like gluten free snack items. No wheat. Did you find
1196280	1202440	out? Did you gauge and go, oh shit, I'm a celiac. Is that what it's called? No, I'm not celiac. I'm
1202440	1205960	like, I have a sensitivity and you know, like when you go to a restaurant and you say like,
1205960	1211080	I don't eat gluten, they're always like, is it an allergy? They're calling you out. That's like
1211080	1215800	when you go to the restaurant and go table for a five and there's only two of you and you're like,
1215800	1223400	are they all here? Yeah. Okay. I'm three of them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm not, I don't have
1223400	1228440	celiac. That's like legit. I'm an actress. I just, I make shit up and then like make my life harder.
1229800	1235560	But the gluten thing is, it, we don't have to talk about this all night, but I, I like, but,
1235560	1240680	but you're a good person to talk to you about it. Cause you're the goddamn it Harmon, get, pull your,
1240680	1248520	get your shit together. Um, it's, um, uh, the, the, the reason why it's like, uh, in the zeitgeist is
1248520	1254280	because we, you don't have to be allergic to it in order to, uh, possibly benefit from cutting it
1254280	1258920	out. Correct. Yeah. There are a lot of people with gluten sensitivities. There's a lot of pesticides
1258920	1264040	on wheat and people have a sensitivity. I guess that's my question. Like it's not about, oh,
1264040	1269160	we're all finding out some of us are have reactions to it. Is it, is it more like carbs where we're
1269160	1275000	like, oh, we, we cracked the code. Oh yeah. I mean, there's like the whole like paleo craze where you
1275000	1278760	like cut out starches too, but like that's been going on. Yeah. I mean, if you want to, if you
1278760	1283320	want to be thin, you don't eat wheat, which is why wheat thins are just a terrible snack.
1284760	1288440	Now that we look back at it, it's like, of course that's what they were. That's,
1288440	1292120	they knew that in the boardroom. They're like, we shouldn't call it wheat fats.
1293480	1297480	It's going to make them fat. That's why I like a Trisket cause it doesn't try to fucking lie to you.
1299240	1304280	Fuck Trisket. A Trisket named itself as a mythical character. A Trisket.
1305400	1308280	When they were coming up with the name Marlboro, they weren't like,
1308920	1314680	what sounds the most like cancer? Yeah. What we want to drive home is what's going to happen.
1316040	1322120	They want to whisk you away. Yeah. Cool. But Trisket is a biscuit that's Trisk. Like what is it?
1323320	1327000	Well, how do they get that name? I bet it's try. I bet that my guess, my guess,
1327720	1333800	three forms of fucking something, like do you get three forms of protein? Yeah. You got your
1333800	1338440	breads and your cereals and your grains. I'll bet you a million dollars. No, I won't bet you.
1338440	1341800	No, no, no, no. Bet me a million dollars. No, no, I did not bet you a million dollars.
1341800	1347400	They also have to be kind of tying into the Tisket, a task kit, right? Like that, right?
1348280	1354680	Shit. No, that's it. But why are then? Why the Trisket? Why not? On the back of the Trisket box,
1354760	1360760	I bet there's like a weird fucking triangle. Yeah. Where there's like a basket of bread
1360760	1366760	and then like a bundle of wheat and then like a chicken with a bicycle or something. And it's like,
1367720	1371320	chicken bread. And it's like, you get all three and it's like, it's good for you. And then there's
1371320	1378120	probably like a woman in a leotard, like doing the splits. Yeah. This is my guess. No. Actually,
1378120	1383240	that's not being my guess and turned into me. Just creating pornography for myself. Sure. Yeah.
1383240	1385960	And then there's like a guy in a Superman costume just watching from the corner.
1386600	1391480	He's watching the chicken on the bicycle though. Yeah. Yeah. No, there's a dotted line. Yeah. And
1391480	1397560	if you, it stops, it stops halfway. And if you like, they discerning consumers of Triskets are
1397560	1404760	like, no, he's into the chicken. Yeah. No, that's his game. Yeah. Yeah. Um, okay. Well, I was kind of,
1404760	1410360	so, uh, you mentioned, uh, vaping is like, like, like we, we, we respect any privacy you want.
1410360	1415320	You're a new friend. Do you, do you want to, can we talk about pot for a little bit? We can talk
1415320	1421880	about pot. Uh, so sativa indica, uh, I, I, I'm just trying to figure this out. Well, you are,
1421880	1426840	you're just trying to figure it out. I've been at 43 years old, smoking pot since I was 18,
1426840	1431480	but I, I think this, I don't know which is the one that makes me check my pulse and, and right.
1431480	1437080	Sativa's the upper. Yeah. Sativa's the upper and indica is like to be a little sleepier.
1437800	1443320	I'm in the process of an experiment and I could, so I did the first half of it. I went,
1443320	1448200	I went to a, uh, party and I, and I was, I've talked to my girlfriend about this because she
1448200	1454200	vapes like, you know, she's part of this whipper snapper vape and generation. Yeah. And I, uh,
1454200	1461720	where is it? Um, Oh shit. I'll never pot research. Okay. Here we go. So I started,
1461720	1470280	so this is the first half. Cause I, so this is the, I, it's a, uh, eight 38 PM sativa big hit
1470280	1478040	blue dream. I think that's the kind of pot at animals screening. El Cid that's a restaurant
1478040	1487240	here. And yeah, people love it. It's very uncomfortable, anxious, constantly conscious of
1487240	1493640	chest. Two deep breaths helped had to stop breathing after noting slash hallucinating the
1493640	1502760	notion that people are watching me breathing. That's all eight 38. Wow. And then eight 42,
1502760	1508680	it says still same a little better. Doesn't make it even make sense. How can it still be the same
1508680	1514200	and a little bit better? Just say a little better, but he's high. Yeah. Eight 52, 10 minutes after
1514200	1521800	that. This is the last injury. Just high, really fucking high, as high as you can get without a net
1521800	1529480	negative experience without a negative and then a capital M I was also, I think I started having
1529480	1534440	fun at that point. You're like, fuck this, but that's what it looks like. And that, that was my
1534440	1539960	estimation. It's like, and when I, like, like, like I, I think getting high on pot is worth what
1540040	1548440	happens to me often, which is this, uh, eight 38 to eight 52. I'm bad at math. Yeah. Are you good at
1548440	1555400	it? No, no, of course not. Okay. All right. What, say what? 14 minutes. Oh, really? Yeah, that's even
1555400	1560920	better than I thought. It's 14 minutes of like, I'll, I'm checking my pulse and like, I'm worried
1560920	1567320	that, um, everyone knows I'm high and, uh, and then I'm, and then I'm, I'm too old to be getting
1567320	1572680	high. But then you like, you like mellowed into it and you had a great time. Yeah, absolutely.
1572680	1577080	Pot's the best. Like, like, it's just so much better than alcohol because alcohol, which you're
1577080	1583400	seeing me on, it's like killing yourself, like you're just slowly falling asleep in front of
1583400	1588360	and making it everyone else's problem. Zoe, did you say which one you, you prefer the sativa or
1588360	1593480	indica? I prefer sativa. Yeah. I don't need help. And so you're saying the idea, because I'm glad
1593480	1598360	you didn't say head high and body high, which has never meant anything because if your head was high,
1598360	1605160	your body would freak out and vice versa for sure. Yeah. Hold on. I'm processing that.
1605800	1611720	If your body's high, my head's going to be like, whoa. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, totally.
1611720	1616360	I don't want to clear head if my body's high. I think doesn't, doesn't body high include head?
1617960	1621800	I think the people using the phrases head high and body high are so used to being high
1621880	1626680	that they don't know what it's like to be bad high. Anybody who can get bad high is like,
1626680	1632840	and whose life is high body high, Jesus Christ, what are you talking about? You're scaring me
1632840	1637720	even more foot high, arm high. It's the worst show to not have Spencer here tonight. He would
1637720	1642120	settle this for us. We have, we have no Spencer tonight. No, I, it's punishment. He should not
1642120	1648440	take off. I like that you're like, though, I think like a real time documentation is cool.
1648440	1653240	Yeah. Yeah. My girlfriend said, they'll just do both. And like, let's figure it out. And I was
1653240	1657880	like, okay, but we have to spread it out over days. So that's the Tiva. That's the Tiva. So you
1657880	1662360	haven't done the indica. I haven't done the experiment yet. And then of course, there's
1662360	1666920	a million flavors and stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. See for me, like I, I'm such a lightweight with
1666920	1672840	marijuana. I can only do sativa and operate. Like if I do indica, like heavy stuff, I hang out with
1672840	1679880	people like Greg Proops, as he says, he gets his weed from Yoda. His weed is wild. And like,
1679880	1685800	if I give his joint a stern glance, I'm fucked up. So I'll do it. Like if we're on the bus,
1685800	1690440	like, like a tour bus for like eight hours where I don't have to do anything at all,
1690440	1695400	but he can get up and talk and he's articulate and stuff like that. I'm completely wiped out by
1695400	1700760	indica. So Tiva, I can kind of get by, but I still just want to sit down and eat Triscuits.
1708120	1710680	Tired of not being able to eat a box?
1714520	1719320	Sink your teeth into the cold, hard, crazy flavor of Triscuits. Oh,
1720920	1724840	Sam Elliott do a Triscuits commercial. Hello, I'm Sam Elliott for Triscuits.
1725880	1731160	It's a new feature. I'm into it. The wheat thin is for pussies,
1733560	1738600	but the Triscuit holds up to the cold, hard salami that you're used to.
1740840	1745240	No, it's better. I'm sorry. I put you on the spot. Well, that's the job. It should be like Sam,
1745240	1752040	Sam Elliott for, for pussy. It should be funny. I'm Sam Elliott for pussy.
1752040	1759240	Sometimes when I come home from a long day on the range, I like to take a nice pussy,
1760920	1767480	put it on a Triscuit. All right. He snuck it in synergy. He puts the pussy on the Triscuit.
1767480	1771320	He puts the pussy on the Triscuit because the Triscuit can stand up to whatever you
1771320	1774840	want to put on it. As I understand it and I don't know his own business. You can't put a
1774840	1782760	pussy on a ritz. It'll shatter. Triscuit has that lattice structure to it that can take what
1782760	1788680	you fucking give it. Put your, put your pussy on a cracker that can hold it.
1791320	1797160	That should be Hillary's new platform. I put my pussy on a Triscuit or I get the hose again.
1797160	1805320	It's a, there's a silence in the lamps. You just mentioned Hillary Clinton,
1805320	1808840	so that was the other uncomfortable place where we could not go because politics are so fucking
1808840	1813240	boring. I know. But I just saw an article that I found absolutely fascinating, but I'm not allowed
1813240	1819080	to find it that fascinating because I'm a fucking dude and like my fascination will bleed over into
1819080	1824440	perceived agenda, which I do not have. Yeah. I'm sure I have, I'm seething with agenda,
1825400	1830760	but my agenda is like, I love women and hope they love me and wish that they would fucking like,
1830760	1835400	wish them all the best. So that's my agenda. Like I was trying to impress people, but, but like,
1835400	1841000	therefore I found it absolutely fascinating that did you see this, like maybe it's overhyped,
1841000	1847640	but, uh, Madeline Albright and Gloria Steinem, who are these like, sort of like, you know,
1847720	1855880	heroes of the dichotomies are clashing because it's like, Oh, what's more progressive being out
1855880	1862440	of touch or being a woman? Like, I, because it was essentially like they were, uh, I would use the
1862440	1867240	verb cause being, if that didn't now mean something else before that, like, like, like, like it meant
1867240	1870920	what it means now. It was like, like, they were kind of like, they were like, you whippersnappers,
1870920	1874360	you don't know what you're doing. Right. Like, like you're fucking up. Why are you backing
1874360	1880360	Bernie Sanders? And there's been like, what, a lot of the sensationalized, like, uh, out of context
1880360	1887560	pieces are like, um, these like very stately, like really respected power women from a really,
1887560	1891960	from a much older generation appearing on talk shows. And I can't remember who it was that was
1891960	1897480	on the Bill Maher show that, that, that, that, that said like, Oh, with Gloria Steinem. Was it,
1897480	1902760	was it her shoes on? I think some of these, some of these young ladies are backing Bernie Sanders
1902760	1906120	because that's where the boys are. Like, like, like that, they're, I don't know if that, that's not a
1906120	1910040	quote. My dad told me today that there's something called Bernie boys or something, or Bernie bros,
1910040	1913720	the Bernie bros. This is a thing. And like, that's the guys who dress up like ponies.
1916600	1926760	Yeah, that's right. Buroni. Yeah, that's right. Um, go ahead. But no, that they're like, that,
1926760	1932760	that there's this now like contingent of Bernie supporters who are like, I don't know,
1933320	1937560	who maybe misogynist or something. They're saying that they're like, is that the thing?
1938600	1950120	And yeah, I heard only those two lines that the Gloria Steinem line about the girls just going
1950120	1955800	where the boys are for, for Bernie. I've only heard that quote taken just alone. I don't know
1955800	1958920	what led up to that or what followed that, which is an important part of the story. That's how I'm
1958920	1963880	trying, which I'm trying to own up to. And in the, uh, that it's out of context and that, you know,
1963880	1966840	we're talking about somebody talking for a half hour. It doesn't sound like, like, like, you know,
1966840	1970760	Gloria Steinem, who's just, you know, one of the most famous and awesome feminists of all time.
1970760	1977320	She certainly, I don't think anyone would want to say that, but I do find that it's, it's a
1977320	1981480	fascinating concept. I guess that's it. It was like, as a dude, if I was just up here, I find
1981480	1985160	this fascinating. It's like, Oh yeah. But what's your angle? What are you trying to prove that
1985160	1988760	feminism is full of shit? Women are going to be fighting each other. She's too smart to have said
1988760	1994360	that. And, and, and, and meant that now you're, well, Lee on the front row is shaking. You think
1994360	2000840	she actually misspoke and said some terrible shit. Well, grab a mic. So just say real quick,
2000840	2007720	Leo, this is Lee everybody. Hi. Yeah, I listened to it. And, um, yeah, no, it was,
2008680	2011960	it was just, she was talking really quickly to Bill Maher. So she just wasn't thinking
2012680	2016520	kind of. And so she was completely sincere and it wasn't really attached to anything,
2016520	2021080	unfortunately. And everything else she was saying, I was totally agreeing with. And the point she was
2021080	2025080	kind of making, I think is that she was talking like she was at the beginning of the feminist
2025080	2029080	movement. And so she was saying like, at the beginning, it was just a handful of us. And,
2029080	2034040	and we were like the crazy outsider ladies. And so she was saying, now it's, now it's everyone,
2034040	2038520	you know, now, now it's like a pretty common movement. And, um, and so if you were around
2038520	2043400	the beginning of the feminist movement, the idea of a female being president is so exciting to me
2043400	2048680	right now, because I'm fucking 27 and like we, there hasn't been a female president of Hillary's
2048680	2052600	not president. Maybe I'm going to be fucking 50 before there's president. And so that's kind of
2052600	2059560	the point she was making. Uh, but no, she just literally, it was incredibly offensive and there's
2059560	2065240	not really a way to defend it at all. Other, other than that's the point I think she was making was
2065240	2069640	that she fought so hard, you know, to like, just like try to get women to where they are.
2069640	2073000	And so then these young women who have just been born into this kind of
2074200	2078680	perceived state of privilege, you know, don't, don't understand what a huge deal it is that
2078680	2083000	we even have a woman in the fucking running right now. And I love Bernie. I love fucking Bernie.
2083000	2085960	You know, like, I love that he's going around saying all this crazy shit.
2085960	2088680	You also love a nice cool Coors light.
2090280	2092760	I've been drinking all day. I've been at a Super Bowl party.
2092920	2097880	There's no better way to wash down a Trisket. No, I'm, no, I'm a wheat thin girl. I'm a
2097880	2106520	wheat thin girl. But unfortunately, unfortunately, it was just, it was just horribly offensive.
2106520	2112840	It was just like totally out of line because I can't let me sit back and be fascinated by it.
2112840	2118680	So you're a 27 year old girl. You don't speak on behalf of all women. Uh, but you are at least
2118680	2126680	at all. Like, like, like, like, like, like, like you talk about what's offensive about it. Like,
2126680	2131080	like, like, I think I know, but if I, if I pontificate about it, I sound like a fucking
2131080	2137480	AM radio DJ with some kind of weird agenda. It's just absurd because what we're just supposed to
2137480	2143320	like Hillary, because she has a vagina, which is what I just said is partly why I want her to be
2143320	2149800	president because I deserve it. I just the same way, like people have talked about how Chris Rock
2149800	2153720	said that there was like a black president. And so that's changed things. So now like little
2153720	2158600	black boys can be like, I could be president, which they didn't have before. I'm still a woman.
2158600	2163800	I've never, I've never had that. And I want that. And I want my children to have that. And I want
2163800	2168440	it as soon as fucking possible. And so I am voting with my pussy and I understand that that's like
2168440	2172600	inappropriate. And I also enjoy Bernie and I like that he's running around, you know,
2172600	2177080	well, so you're saying everyone gets a pony. You're saying you're trusting us with the
2177080	2180200	information that you are voting for Hillary and you are doing it for that reason. Well,
2180200	2185000	I also just digger. I think she's like a real groovy lady. You know, I don't think I didn't
2185000	2189400	when we talked when Maria Butcher was up here, like, I think she said a similar thing to the
2189400	2194520	basically Yeah, what's like, like, because the is it's like, yeah, she was the one I think president
2194520	2200840	do if the from top to bottom on the list of things that they accomplished that are the most
2200840	2206120	effective, probably number one has to do with symbology and stuff. Oh, great. Oh, great.
2209800	2213400	Yeah. All right. All right. Well, look,
2214040	2218760	but why it was so offensive, which is like incredibly obvious is no one's saying that
2218760	2222680	like men are voting for Bernie because he has a dick and everyone has a dick.
2222680	2224120	Fucking Rob. Sure. God damn it.
2226520	2229640	So handsome and fun. That was my point. I've been drinking all day. I don't know if I said that
2229640	2241880	already. Sorry. It was tell me Leah was was was Gloria. Is she pro Hillary? Yeah. Yeah,
2241880	2246120	she is. And so she's Do you think she's saying that like to kind of like say like, hey, like,
2246120	2252040	like, like these, these, like, she's, she's like, straight up saying, yeah, these women that are
2252040	2255800	voting for Bernie, they're just doing it to get laid. But the real women, the real feminists are
2255800	2259560	over there on Hillary's side. Is that what she's saying? The way that I would, you know,
2259560	2264360	most optimistically interpret it was what I already said was that she was around for the
2264360	2267960	beginning of the movement where everyone was like, you should be barefoot and fucking pregnant. And
2267960	2272840	now we've come such a long way in America where it's more insidious, the hatred of women. Like,
2272840	2278440	you can't just, you can't just overtly see it. It's been stirred in. It still exists in a very
2278440	2283560	potent way, but you can't just point at it and be like, it is pretty bad because we do,
2283560	2288360	we do need to have a female, a woman president as soon as possible because it's been, you know,
2288360	2294920	we've had what 48 or 49 in a row. Uh, the, uh, the idea that she has Madeleine Albright thing
2294920	2301480	is a special place in hell for women that don't, don't look after women at glorious time. It's
2301480	2305160	like, yeah, you guys are all being a bunch of dicks. Like fucking get up, get on board.
2305160	2309800	But by the way, exactly, exactly that, that, that to me, like, I, I don't mind that. I think that's
2309800	2313960	all right. Because like fucking whatever, whatever it takes, shouldn't they be, shouldn't
2313960	2318840	they be, it's, it's like, I hate to make obvious allegory, but like, like, when you talk about
2318840	2323160	groups and you talk about interest and you talk about all this shit and the alienation versus
2323160	2328280	unification and stuff, and I'm a straight white fat male, I'm just looking at all the rest of it.
2328280	2334680	But if a 70 year old Black Panther said, you know, like we used like really rough and tumble in or
2334680	2339720	out language, you know, would you fault it as much? And so that was the other facet. That's why
2339720	2343800	he was like, I'm so fascinated with the story because I'm like, wait, how am I being fed this
2343800	2350680	on my iPhone next to Amber alerts? Is there already a fucking like hamster bottle in place
2350680	2354840	where I'm being told like, it's the easiest information to get into my mouth that women
2354840	2358920	are fighting again? Like, like, like, boy, are they, are they ever going to get along or what?
2358920	2362360	Honestly, and I've been drinking all day, so I can't believe I'm saying this in front of an
2362360	2368440	audience. But like, I feel like this weird pushback towards Hillary. And I understand that like she,
2368440	2373000	no, no, Jeff, this is only half you have the bottle of vodka. This isn't fair. I don't have
2373000	2376600	anything. Jeff, there's a bottle of vodka. I was gonna steal your beer, but it's warm as
2376600	2381880	yeah. Dan, could you maybe pour me some vodka while I continue to? Yeah, but we got it.
2383080	2389160	But okay, so like, best intentions is what Jeff was saying. How many drinks do you say,
2389240	2394760	would you say you've had today? Like, um, like all beer, have you been doing spirits? No,
2394760	2400520	it's been like, it's been like vodka. It's been vodka. All right, come on. It's gonna continue.
2400520	2402920	She's not trimming Capote. Who cares? Let's talk to Zoe Lister.
2403720	2410360	I'm still making good lucid points. No, you are. Oh, God damn it. All right. That was your drink.
2412360	2418840	All right. That was the one for your downfall. The way I choose to view what she, what her
2418840	2423080	intention was, which obviously no one's going to talk about. It's just that she's thought she's
2423080	2427640	fought so hard for like just even the chance, even like an inkling that we could ever have a woman
2427640	2432760	president. And so to her, it's just like appalling that 18 year old women would be like, I like
2432760	2437240	Bernie cause you know, cause he makes all these great points and he's not part of like this
2437240	2442360	corrupt system, you know, which is all fantastic reasons to vote for him. And so that's the most
2443000	2449560	genuine, positive way you can view her statements is I, and I totally understand that like we need
2449560	2453320	a fucking woman president as soon as possible. And Gloria Steinem is just like viewing these
2453320	2458440	18 year old women being for Bernie as being like, what are you fucking doing? Like we need a woman
2458440	2462600	president. Like you don't understand what you're doing. But then the fact that she said that
2462600	2470040	they're voting for her because, because they want to impress the boys is so incredibly offensive
2470040	2474280	because why aren't the boys trying to impress us? If anything, like the 18 year old boys are
2474280	2479560	trying so hard to get pussy that like I have to try negative amount. I'm 27 now. I've tried
2479560	2485800	negative amounts to get dick my entire life. Uh, well I've watched men try like a million times
2485800	2493560	more than me to get pussy. And so, so why would women be voting for Bernie? What? Sorry. I was
2493560	2502280	just asking what cracker you think he put dick on to me. I would, I would go lateral and put it
2502280	2510120	slide it, slide it between an inverted pair of baked Pringles. Yeah. Here's your drink.
2511080	2518600	Let's have a hand for our election correspondent. She's been drinking all day. She's got a room
2518600	2522920	temperature for his life. Yeah. So it was offensive, but I don't think she meant it.
2523480	2526600	Let's not think of it as losing Aliyah. Let's think of it as gaining a Rob Shropp.
2532840	2539960	I'm, I'm pretty sure you guys forgot I came tonight. I'm, I'm, I'm pretty sure you guys
2539960	2543720	forgot I was in the, in the back room. We were, we were saving you like a secret weapon.
2544680	2551080	I think you guys forgot that I was here. Can we, can we wrap things up with Zoe so we can focus on you?
2551080	2559320	Zoe, your name means life. Yeah. Yeah. I learned that from TC 2000, uh, the Billy Blanks, uh,
2559320	2565160	post-apocalyptic movie from the nineties, direct to video. You should watch that. Really? Yeah.
2565160	2570120	You should check it out. It's, it, you would really like it. Is the protagonist named Zoe? No, it's,
2570200	2580280	no, his name is TC, TC 2000, but there's a lady in there named Zoe and he, and Billy Blanks says,
2580280	2585080	your name means life. It's actually a part. That's how I learned that. Is it, is it a Greek
2585080	2590520	root? What is it? It is, it is. Yeah. My mom, um, when I was born, she like studied Cobb,
2590520	2597240	Kabbalah. And so Cobb Kabbalah. Oh God. She's more cosmic to learn Kabbalah for sure. She studied
2597240	2603720	Cobb Kabbalah and, um, and I was going to call it like Kabbalah, but then I, you know, anyway,
2603720	2609400	um, yeah, she studied that and you're not supposed to give your kid a name for a week. Oh. And you're
2609400	2614840	supposed to name it the shittiest name you can think of so that like the angel of death passes over.
2614840	2623080	I love this. Yeah. So she named me dirt pan, which I should have kept in English or there
2623080	2628760	was a Greek version of that. No, no, in English. Yeah. We're not Greek. Yeah. So for a week,
2628760	2634440	they call you, Hey, dirt pan, pooped her pants. That's so amazing. Yeah. I've never heard that.
2634440	2639880	Yeah. I mean, you know, she might've made that, that like Kabbalah law up. She just blamed it.
2640040	2644760	I still believe that. She was just doing her own Pippi log stocking society and she's like,
2644760	2648840	it's Kabbalah. Yeah. All of her abusive tendencies. She blames Kabbalah. And then after a week,
2648840	2654600	she goes, okay, you're not dirt pan your life. Right. Yeah. Well from dirt pan comes life. Oh,
2654600	2660120	that's, that's so great. Cause I like my cat, my cat's name is a Fiv, which is F I V because
2660120	2663960	I didn't want to fall in love with her because I was told she had F I V, which I thought was like
2663960	2667560	HIV. And I had something like, I didn't, I thought my cat, I thought I was like, I rescued this cat
2667560	2672040	and I was like, I don't want to get attached. And like, we just started calling it F I V or FIV.
2672040	2678440	And then like, and then it's, you know, let me find an FIV. But it was like, but there was a
2678440	2683960	ritual there where it was like, Oh, this, this time went by where you were like actively saying,
2683960	2690280	and then this like goes back to ancient Greece and whatever. Like Oedipus, Oedipus's name is derived
2690280	2694840	from the fact that his feet were big and it was because they tied your feet together when they
2694840	2699480	would lay you on a rock for the wolves, which was a Greek abortion. Like, like they would just go,
2699480	2707080	fuck this kid. That'd be a name. Greek abortion. Yeah. Instead of dirt, dirt pan. Yeah.
2707080	2710360	That's like a Jay Leno desk piece. Okay. It's time to do some Greek abortions.
2713160	2721800	Okay. This one comes to us from, uh, yeah, the Acropolis. Third trimester. Um, anyways,
2721800	2726680	but that idea that there's like a spirit passing over and then there's a point where it's like,
2726680	2731320	Oh, this, this thing's for keeps. I love the, I love that that you would have a kid and be like,
2731320	2738280	you're a piece of shit. Your name is shit face. And then you're like trying to trick the demons.
2738920	2742760	Oh, that's a shit face. I don't want that. And then, and then you're like, the coast is clear.
2742760	2750440	You're Theodore. I fucking love that. I love that so much. Yeah. And then she couldn't,
2750440	2754760	like she couldn't think of a name. So I think probably the dirt pan was prolonged longer than
2754760	2759480	it should have been. But she, that's why where she got Zoe was like, she was at the back of the
2759480	2763800	baby name book. And she was like, ah, fuck it. They literally refer to you for the first week.
2763800	2768200	Like, like your mom and dad were calling you dirt pan. Like that, like that's, that's your handle
2768200	2773080	for that. I mean, I think so. I wasn't, I don't, I don't have memories that early, but I think so.
2773080	2776120	That's what you end up doing with kids anyway, though. Like they all have like these little names
2776200	2779560	like they're a little, hey, little nug nug, you know, it's like, why am I nug nug? Well,
2779560	2785800	you used to eat cat shit out of the fucking vent and you'd go nug nug. And you're like,
2785800	2791080	you did shit all over your face. And we were like, you're a piece of shit. That's why I love it is
2791080	2795320	because it's like an organic thing that happens where you're like, you're fucking, you're garbage.
2795320	2800280	Totally. You're a rug rat. Yeah. So many people are just like, I mean, hopefully,
2800280	2804040	worshiping kids and worshiping you that you got to give them a shitty name.
2804040	2806680	I used to call my pacifier, my Nuni.
2810520	2815960	And that's, that seems like fine information. Yeah. Like there's no reason to not say that.
2815960	2819400	That checks out. Yeah. How long did you have your pacifier Rob? I got it.
2819400	2825720	That's a way too long. Like, like till what age? 12. No, no, no. I was just to the point where
2827080	2831960	by the time it was taken away from him, its name was Nuni Anastasia Henderson the third.
2831960	2836680	Yeah. Like my mom kept throwing it away. I would dig it out of the garbage and be walking around
2836680	2842760	with the house like, ain't no nothing but a thing. Just suck my neck. I had a banky that I didn't
2842760	2847560	want to part with. Banky? Banky. Like a blanket. Like a little blanket. Yeah. So mine makes more
2847560	2855720	sense. I mean. Well, that's from, that's from Mr. Mom. That wasn't a movie when I had my banky.
2856520	2863640	Was it? They called it a banky in Mr. Mom. Okay. Well, let's assume I was. Mine wasn't
2863640	2868920	ripped off. I actually, my Nuni was, I don't remember. That was original.
2870440	2874920	So wait, did you have a banky or a would be or anything like that? No. I didn't have any of
2874920	2880040	those things. You had a dirt pan? Yeah. She was a dirt pan. I was a dirt pan. Yeah. I didn't need
2880040	2885560	anything else. What is a dirt pan? Yeah. Why do you need a pan to collect dirt? Well, when you sweep,
2885640	2891480	like a dust pan. But I think she thought that dirt pan was even like. Yeah. Yeah. Like a bucket of
2891480	2895320	shit. Why would you have a bucket of shit? Yeah. Who knows? It's like worthless. That's my point.
2895320	2900840	So if, like dust isn't that bad. So if your, if your parents' friends that are also into Kabbalah
2900840	2905960	come over and like, Hey, I've got shit for brains. It's the best. It's a fucking best.
2905960	2908920	That's what really happens anyway. When your friends have kids and they're like,
2908920	2913400	do you want, do you want to say how to fucking shit fuck? That's what really happens with your
2913480	2918760	kids, right? That's what we all do. Just name them like little life ruiner. Yeah. But, but,
2918760	2923720	but like broken dreams, but we always make those jokes. Really? You go over to your friend's house
2923720	2929400	and you have a six pack and you want to look at little, little fuck face. Yeah. It's all,
2929400	2938440	we all talk that way about the little kids. Like dream. Pause dream. Oh yeah. It's sort of like
2938440	2946280	a slam poetry thing going on. Consumed. Slam poetry. All we learned about it is that you wrote
2946280	2951160	it and produced it and your husband who I met back stage directed it and produced it. So like,
2953480	2958280	independent filmmaking. Yes. Where are you at with this? Where's this movie? Well,
2959240	2964680	where's this movie? It's coming out on iTunes and digital platforms March 22nd. No theatrical
2964680	2968680	release. Uh, we did this cool thing with this company called gather, which is called theatrical
2968680	2972440	and demand, which is kind of like where indie filmmakers are like headed a lot of the time,
2972440	2978600	because, um, basically it's like crowdsourcing theatrical, a theatrical release. So you're not
2978600	2983240	relying on a distribution company to like put it in a few theaters and then like be up against huge
2983240	2988840	tent pole movies. You're actually, is that then, does that then allow the it to be only in theaters
2988840	2993080	where there is a demand? Right. So, and that's still, you can still see the movie that way,
2993240	2997880	that'll be going on for the next few months too. Um, if you just go to, to the movie's website,
2997880	3002280	consumed the movie.com, uh, you basically see like anywhere in the country, you can type in
3002280	3005960	where you are and you can see if there's a screening and if 60 people sign up, the screening
3005960	3010520	happens. Oh, that's perfect. Yeah. That's the way it should go at this point. Yeah. I mean, it,
3010520	3014040	it seems like, yeah, that's the way it should go, especially there's so much content. Like so many
3014040	3018120	people are making movies that there's, there's not enough. Well, also it's always, it's just a tiered
3018120	3022360	thing. Like we're still living in this old world thing that the people who just want to make their
3022360	3027480	movie and distribute it, which is totally great. It's like, but we're all like drawn into this whole
3027480	3032120	theatrical distribution thing. And there's this really old system where they, it's a little bit
3032120	3037720	based on making you ashamed of like how many people want to come out and watch your movie. It's sort
3037720	3042040	of like, I, it's like, Oh, we're going to, we'll go to the 20 cities, uh, these three cities and
3042040	3046040	based on how they perform them, we'll try to have five cities and we'll do seven cities. Oh, bad
3046040	3052280	news guys. Like it doesn't have to be that way in a world where you can, George Clooney can
3052280	3056680	get online and go, if three people give me a dollar for AIDS research, I'll cut my mustache off
3056680	3062040	and put a shoe on my head. Like it sounds like everything's real time now. Totally picking on
3062040	3066280	people for how they fly or don't fly first class. You could fucking not, you don't have to.
3067400	3073480	Yeah, no, yes. Yeah, it democratizes the process in a really cool way, which is what like art should
3073480	3079240	be about. How did you guys meet? How did you, uh, we, uh, we were just like in the back room there
3079240	3085800	and I said, Hey, I'm Rob. I'm in the show. And, and, you know, it's, you know, kind of,
3085800	3089480	kind of went from there. Look, I'm a straight shooter. I don't, I don't know her for madam.
3089480	3097240	Really? Yeah. Really? Yeah. Never met her. It's a blind day. I love it. Yeah. Did your husband
3097240	3103320	know about this? He's here. He's into it. No, no, no. Now is he the Jones or are you,
3103320	3108680	and you're the, my mom's Lister and my dad's Jones. Uh, they, my mom didn't want to take my dad's name.
3109320	3116040	Whispers. Is your dad renowned in the industry? No, no, no. That's what I thought. No, his name is,
3117000	3122040	no, he, his name is Bill Jones, which is a very common name. He's a conceptual photographer in
3122040	3127880	New York. Oh, not. He's renowned in that field. Sure. Is he renowned or not? I demand to know.
3127880	3132360	Is that like a qualification to be on this podcast? Oh, your parent, one of your parents has to be
3132360	3136760	renowned. Yeah. We have to be able to trace renowned men. That seems to actually be like a
3136760	3141480	big deal. No, the truth is, uh, remember when we had Colin Hanks on? Who's on my show. He plays my
3141480	3148600	husband on TV. So there you go. That's the connection. So I love men at work. That's all
3148600	3155720	right. Anyways, you have a hard out, you have a 4am call. Yeah, that's Colin Hay. It's criminal
3155720	3162120	that you're here from the union standpoint. What? What Jeff? Colin Hay is who you're thinking of. What?
3162120	3173720	What? Into the mic, please. What? You're thinking of Colin Hay from men at work. Men at what?
3176760	3179880	Rob and I are doing a sketch show at, uh, right now.
3183640	3189640	You have a 4am call here in town? No, I have a 5am call. So I have to get up at like around 4. Yeah.
3189640	3196920	Zoey Lister Jones, uh, to, to our handful of, uh, listeners, uh, that want to go find consumed,
3196920	3202920	uh, uh, uh, you know, not to put you on the spot, but you know, here's your, tell them why to do
3202920	3208840	it. I guess. Consume the movie.com. Consume the movie.com. Uh, it's cool. It's like, uh, like
3208840	3213480	harkens back to like 70s thrillers where people talked about real shit that's going on in the
3213480	3218920	world. And where the bad guy was, there's some real shit. Yeah. Like the prophecy. Sure. Not the
3218920	3224440	Christopher Walken one. The prophecy with, uh, with, uh, with a guy or like frogs with Sam Elliott.
3224440	3230680	Yes. And, uh, Ray Meland. All right. Yeah. Well, yes, with all due respect, I don't think we're
3230680	3236200	going to see any of them again. Not alive anyway. Hey, Sam Elliott, do it, do a commercial for
3236200	3245800	Zoey Lister Jones. Oh, oh God. If you like Triscuits, well, I know exactly what to put on it.
3246520	3254760	Oh, she's tall. She's pale. I am pale. She's lean. She may or may not wear socks. I can't tell,
3254760	3264600	but she probably, she hides her socks, but she's not hiding a new movie called consume.
3266920	3270680	Unlike her socks. You can find that online at consume the movie.com.
3271560	3275640	All right. Zoey Lister Jones. Thanks for coming by. Good luck.
3285080	3290280	All right. Now you can come up and sit up here. Not, not until you introduce me.
3295320	3298360	I don't want him to not come to the show, but also it's just like, I want,
3298360	3301320	he's being petulant tonight. I was like,
3302920	3305960	you guys made me wait. I went to the bathroom twice.
3307080	3312680	Oh, Dan, Rob, the headliner waits to come on last. Like maybe we're saving you.
3312680	3316600	You want me to bring you up first and then, and then in the middle of it, I've done that before.
3316600	3320600	I've done that before. I've brought you up first. And then I've brought up some guy. I go like,
3320600	3325320	oh, our next guest has like a weird feeling in his arm and he's worried it might be serious.
3325320	3329640	And then, and then it's like, you're fucking eating fucking peanuts.
3331400	3335960	It's like, it becomes like a sketch and I'm like, I'm a, I've got nothing to do up there.
3335960	3341720	I'm just sitting there. I'm just sitting there like a boob man. I don't want to be a boob. I
3341720	3347560	want to just sit in there, you know, in my back hurts and I'm like, yeah, but you chose to sit
3347560	3354280	in a weird, uh, like vice, vice principles. How many chairs do you, there's not much of a selection.
3355320	3362120	That's the principle way of doing it is the most comfortable. Our next guest is popular with
3362120	3362760	listeners.
3371160	3376760	Let's welcome Rob from the side of the stage, the sender of the stage, Rob Schrod.
3385320	3393960	I think it's better for camera. If you sit in one of the more central chairs,
3393960	3400600	I think Jeff is way too low in this. I've been watching the monitor. You're too low, man. You
3400600	3405160	need to be, I think, I think I have too much. This is a big thing to get around. This is a
3405160	3409400	giant piece of furniture. Yeah. But also you need to, there's a leg thing. If I sit here,
3409400	3414280	I can't get my leg in there because there's a big drawer. Will you do something about this?
3415320	3424280	If this show required doing things about, I wouldn't be able to do it. Our logo would be
3424280	3432520	up and not a peanut painting. By the way, I was told this costs $1,400 not to throw it under the
3432520	3439480	bus. It's beautiful. I just think it's, I think it's interesting because it makes me, because
3439480	3444840	when they said that to me, they said the painting directly behind you costs $1,400. I was like,
3444840	3450600	well, I assume all paintings are $1,400. Isn't that why people paint them? In the time it took
3450600	3459400	me to smear shit on a canvas, I'd make $1,400. Too far? Okay. All right. Harmon lost them.
3459400	3462280	So you don't do a space page? I assumed you were all a bunch of Hemingways.
3464840	3473560	The great painter. What art does it cost $1,400? What art costs $7.95? What art cost more than
3473800	3481640	$7.75? Dan, what's your favorite Hemingway painting, Dan? How much does a Hemingway?
3488920	3495480	Let's all watch this. You pour that in the air. Now, after Dan mentioned that the painting is
3495480	3502520	expensive behind, Rob has moved closer to it. He wants to block it. Yeah, because it costs money to
3502520	3508680	have it on the air. No, because it's an artist getting attention. That is true. That's true.
3508680	3515160	And because it costs, I don't think I've ever gotten $1,400 or anything I'd drawn. Have you ever
3515160	3522520	done canvases like acrylics or oils or anything, Rob? Maybe in high school. Would you do one tonight?
3523640	3531000	Yes. Okay. All right. Sorry. I'm not doing a good job tonight. No. And I'm not ashamed.
3533160	3534840	All right. Rob?
3543080	3547720	What was your favorite sketch? When I first met Rob and Dan, I walked into a comedy sports
3548760	3552760	improv festival tournament in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Don't do this.
3554280	3560600	And I had heard that there was a couple famous squads, teams. Ethan, are you filming the whole
3560600	3567240	thing? Well, he's had his camera up the whole time. All right. It's cheaper than paying for it.
3568360	3573080	But he paid to get... It's more expensive to sit where he's sitting. It costs twice as much to get
3573080	3581640	into the show. All right. All right. I had heard that the New York team was the Burt Firstners.
3583240	3587720	Those guys were supposed to be like... I came from the LA team, which is a hodgepodge of people.
3587720	3593720	And I was one of the couple younger, like the whippersnappers on the team. Right. But the Milwaukee
3593720	3598040	team had the sketch group, a side group called the Dead ALWISE, and that included Rob and Dan
3599000	3603560	and several others. And the Burt Firstners were the side group of the New York team.
3603560	3607720	So I came into a festival very freaked out and nervous because I'd only done comedy sports,
3607720	3614040	I think, you know, eight times or something like that. Not that many times. 9-11. 9-11.
3614840	3622600	Okay. Wait. Can you put a pin? Yeah. You want to put a pin? Okay. Pin. I texted Bob Saget
3623320	3629560	because I had a picture on my watch of Bob Saget's face because it came up. Why was that picture on
3629560	3634840	your watch to begin with? I'll explain that in a second. Okay. But there was a... My Apple watch,
3634840	3640680	when its software got updated, allowed you to have a photo as the watch face. And I... Wow.
3640680	3647160	At 9-11 in the morning. That's great. I know, leaps and bounds. Yeah. I went like this one
3647160	3654920	morning, two days, three days ago, and Bob Saget's face came up and it said 9-11. And I very quickly
3654920	3661800	took a photo of it and I tweeted it to you. Yeah, I saw that. For obvious reasons. Spencer.
3662520	3671880	He's part of the family. Justin Roiland, who is the one who took a picture of Bob Saget's face
3671880	3678280	from the cover of, I think, People. And... That's why that was... You selected that as your...
3678280	3682200	Everybody had a reason. And Bob Saget. I sent it to Bob Saget as well because he's Bob Saget.
3682200	3686680	Are you guys Palsy Wells? No. No, I don't know him. I just said, good morning.
3686680	3697480	And... I saw that. Halfway through the day, Bob Saget tweeted, he responded and said,
3697480	3703080	I am honored. And then he did a bit about like, you're probably the only person that wants to
3703080	3708840	look at my face in the morning or something like that. And everybody was like, Bob Saget tweeted,
3708840	3712920	he tweeted you back. And I was like, oh, that's great. Where is that? I'm going to retweet his
3713400	3718040	tweeting. Tweet, tweet, twat. And I'm like scrolling. And I was like, where is it? Wait,
3718040	3721720	where is it? What happened? Where did it go? He took it down. And then everybody was like,
3721720	3726440	wait, wait, what is it? Yeah, no, I... No, it was him. Was it a fake account? No, it wasn't...
3728680	3735080	He deleted it. He deleted it because he realized after the fact that it was a 9-11 joke. Yeah.
3737560	3741800	He saw his face and didn't see 9-11. Then later on, he goes, oh. And so...
3742760	3754840	Now... And so then I told... Yeah, I told him. It makes me hate him. Right? Doesn't it make you hate
3754840	3763480	a person? Hate might be coming a little hard. Well, like, I mean, what do you know? It doesn't
3763480	3767800	make you love him, doesn't it? Well, also he's famous for having one of the bluest, most dark,
3767880	3772920	dirty stand-ups in the world. That's the thing. When he said it, I'm honored. And I was like,
3772920	3779240	okay, that's glib and stuff. But it was like... Maybe he is a big... He works for a major
3780360	3786040	first responders charity or something like that. What if one of his family died in 9-11?
3786040	3790280	Yeah. Did you know for a fact that he was the one who deleted it? What do you mean, sir?
3790280	3794840	You're saying somebody else runs Bobsack. It's like Twitter? No, because you tweeted. Oh,
3794840	3798440	you're saying he deleted it on his... Yeah. No, yeah. The tweet was deleted. Yeah. Yes.
3800280	3801880	There's a manic depressive in the front row.
3804840	3809240	Rather than explain everything you asked. This is the quickest way. This is a crazy person.
3809240	3814920	He's got Kleenex boxes on his feet and a dog skull around his chest.
3819000	3824680	Did you fire back at Saget about this? No, but I sent a photo. I had Justin
3824920	3831480	at 9-11 PM. Justin tweeted him. Let's all do it every day now.
3831480	3834120	Let's just make that a thing. That's what I started thinking. It's like,
3834120	3837080	maybe it could be a thing, but then I forgot about it.
3837080	3840280	I mean, I would say if you want to, just if you're listening, if you want to...
3841000	3846200	But I guess maybe someone from Netflix called him and said, knock it off. Knock it off.
3847480	3852920	He said, what? No, I laughed. It's great. And he's like, that's a 9-11 joke. Look at the time,
3852920	3856440	you narcissist. Look at the number above your head.
3857400	3861800	But I think it makes me feel like maybe he had something to do with 9-11.
3864920	3869240	Because why would you... Because the statute of limitations still hasn't run out on that.
3870680	3873080	What have you found? Is Saget still under investigation?
3873080	3876120	Because I know he was for a while. I think he's alluded it.
3876120	3880280	Yeah. And I think questions need to be raised. I think this might go all the way to the top.
3881160	3885160	It starts with the people associating his face with 9-11. I'll tell you that.
3887880	3892360	Anyways. All right. Please, one of you was talking and now talk more.
3892360	3894360	You were telling a story.
3894360	3899080	I was saying that I walked into a room and I saw... It was like the first night I was there
3899080	3903000	at Milwaukee Comedy Sports and there was a sketch show happening called The Dead Ale Wives.
3903000	3909560	And you two were on stage and what would have been what? 25, 6, 7, 8, like around that age?
3909560	3911640	I was 24. Rob, you're a few years older, right?
3912280	3912600	Yes.
3912600	3917560	Yeah. And so they were up there doing it and I sat down there and I sat in the back and I was
3917560	3923880	completely bummed out. These guys are renegade. These guys are out there and crazy. And then I
3923880	3927240	wouldn't talk to you guys because I was too afraid of you guys. We all kind of found...
3927240	3930760	We all ended up hanging out. But do you guys remember... Was there a sketch,
3930760	3935240	an alewife sketch, that was the two of you? Did you guys have like a Burton, Ernie,
3935320	3936520	Abbott and Costello kind of...
3936520	3940840	We had a Fred and Barney one that was pretty accurate.
3940840	3941960	What was it? What was that?
3941960	3946760	It was just like a post-apocalyptic Flintstone.
3946760	3948200	Yeah, you were Fred, of course.
3949640	3951400	But probably not funny, right?
3951400	3953000	Oh no, none of those was funny.
3954520	3957640	So yeah, I mean, it's not like the dead parrot. We're not going to do anything.
3957640	3958520	It's not going to be funny.
3958520	3961400	I mean, I don't remember any... I mean, like a post-apocalyptic...
3961880	3963800	I'm kind of drunk.
3963800	3965960	Yeah, we're all very drunk.
3965960	3969720	I'm not saying... I wasn't trying to pin you to pull out one of your sketches and do it.
3969720	3973320	But I think we should do a new sketch called...
3975080	3975800	Oh boy.
3977080	3978280	The drive-through.
3983400	3984600	Now that we're all back together.
3985320	3992200	Oi, get me some french fries.
3996200	3999080	He's in the other side of the car.
3999080	4000200	He's English, so he's not in the lesson.
4000200	4002040	Get me some french fries.
4004920	4006120	Got it, got it.
4014600	4023320	That's genius. Genius.
4023320	4024120	That's very good.
4027160	4030120	But that night, this sketch gets so much better than that.
4030120	4030600	It's like, I love it.
4031800	4033320	The payoff is so huge.
4034920	4036760	It goes places that you don't expect it to go.
4036760	4038200	And that's what I love about this sketch.
4038200	4039320	Yeah, yeah, thanks.
4039880	4040360	Hello?
4041160	4043640	Hello?
4045960	4047960	Yeah, are you still open?
4047960	4049160	May I help you?
4049160	4051640	Yes, we'd like some french fries.
4051640	4053320	I'm sorry, we're not open right now.
4055800	4058680	You should have said that before you let us in.
4058680	4060040	Well, you didn't ask, did you?
4061560	4061800	Well...
4061800	4064280	Oi, ask him when they're open.
4064280	4067320	Oh, oh, I'm sorry, mate.
4067320	4069240	Well, but for you, and not for your friend,
4069240	4072360	and there's no upside if they can drive a car on.
4072360	4073560	That's all right.
4075640	4076520	What were you like, Anne?
4077640	4078760	Who could I get you?
4078760	4081000	Oh, knock me some chips.
4081000	4082760	Oh, that's a fucking take, right?
4082760	4084600	Oh, oh, you got together.
4084600	4085160	Oh, no.
4085160	4086520	You get chips, you can't.
4086520	4088600	Oh, no, they'll be fucking chips.
4088600	4091400	And they'll give me a dime of Dr. Pepper.
4091400	4093000	Oh, no, you're trying to talk to Pepper.
4094760	4096040	He's a writing, isn't he?
4096120	4097240	He's a fucking good one.
4099240	4103160	You're gonna be swimming in giant fucking Dr. Pepper.
4103960	4106680	What would you fucking can't end like in fucking...
4106680	4107560	Oh, yeah.
4117400	4118200	What do you want?
4121800	4123080	Do you guys have shakes?
4124280	4125720	Sorry, we're not open right now.
4126280	4129560	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
4129560	4130280	Do we have shakes?
4130280	4131560	Oh, yes, I fucking question.
4131560	4133800	I've got all the shakes you fucking want.
4135880	4137560	What kind of shake would you like, my friend?
4137560	4138840	Oh, knock me a...
4138840	4141320	I knock me a St. Patrick's Day shake, if you don't know.
4141320	4143960	Oh, then you're gonna get a fucking St. Patrick's Shake, then.
4143960	4145160	Oh, thank you very much.

4159000	4159720	Is it...
4159720	4160680	So, seven pence?
4160680	4161640	I'm sorry, no, no.
4163400	4165800	Oi, it is eight seven pence.
4166680	4169240	Would you explain to your friend how English money works?
4170200	4171720	Eight seven pence.
4174200	4175160	He says it's seven pence.
4175160	4175560	No, it's...
4176520	4178120	You said two and five pence.
4178120	4180120	Oh, that's two quid five.
4181240	4183080	Okay, like, pay the man.
4184040	4187320	Here's seven pence coming through the pneumatic tube
4187320	4188280	underneath the speaker.

4214200	4215560	He don't know what it is.
4216600	4218200	Where do I pick up the food?
4219960	4223320	He wants to know where to pick...
4223320	4225640	He wants to know where to food.
4225640	4227800	He wants to pick up some food.
4227800	4229960	Where the fuck he thinks of fucking food, cunt?
4229960	4232440	Where do you pick up the food?
4232440	4241640	I'm sorry, we're closing now.
4243880	4246840	I just gave you seven pence and you gave me change.
4246840	4251080	He wants to know when he can get the food.
4251080	4251880	And where?
4254600	4255480	You know what? Fuck it.
4262520	4264520	Aghghh.

4420440	4422440	Oh.
4422440	4424440	Oh.
4424440	4426440	Mate, you were fucking dreaming the whole time you were in the drive-thru.
4426440	4428440	You look a fright, sir.
4428440	4430440	You look a fright.
4430440	4432440	Our flight is about to land any second now.
4433440	4436440	Would you like some peanuts or some water on you?
4436440	4438440	Would I like some peanuts?
4438440	4440440	Would you like my peanuts and some water?
4440440	4442440	Would you like some peanuts and some water?
4442440	4444440	I thought you'd never ask.
4444440	4446440	Okay.
4446440	4448440	I'd adore some peanuts.
4448440	4450440	Okay, here we go.
4450440	4452440	It's happening right now.
4452440	4454440	It's happening right now.
4454440	4456440	It's happening right now.
4456440	4458440	This is a real thing, people.
4458440	4460440	It's really happening.
4460440	4462440	Okay.
4462440	4464440	Yes, Sam, may I help you?
4464440	4468440	Do you like some of my peanuts in your water?
4468440	4472440	The people across from me are having sex.
4472440	4474440	I'm across from you.
4474440	4478440	I'm really getting on that penis I'm hearing.
4478440	4482440	Hey, it's first class.
4486440	4488440	Would you like to buy this painting?
4488440	4490440	Would you like to buy this painting?
4490440	4494440	It's only $14,000.
4494440	4498440	They didn't create Snoopy.
4498440	4502440	But they sure the fuck painted it.
4502440	4506440	Did Charles Schultz ever get $1,400 for a fucking painting?
4506440	4508440	No.
4508440	4512440	Charles Schultz or his family gets none of that money.
4512440	4516440	But good grief, he's going to get $1,400.
4516440	4522440	It's your first outsider art rip-off scam, Charlie Brown.
4522440	4530440	I feel a little weird about charging $1,400 for somebody else's ID.
4530440	4532440	That's crazy.
4532440	4534440	I feel a little weird about that.
4534440	4536440	Maybe if it was parody, like if Lucy was sucking a dick.
4536440	4538440	Just like a weird skull thing.
4538440	4540440	Okay, so your name is what?
4540440	4544440	And how much were you charged for this fan art?
4544440	4546440	Okay, okay.
4546440	4554440	Yeah, let's go with like $1,400.
4554440	4560440	A hush comes over a crowd full of people that lift nothing for a living.
4560440	4562440	Never will.
4562440	4564440	They're like, wait a minute.
4564440	4568440	Oh shit, my Etsy shop just closed.
4568440	4570440	No, you're fine.
4570440	4572440	Keep doing your Mr. T lunch boxes.
4572440	4576440	And scud shirts.
4576440	4578440	You know you're doing it.
4578440	4580440	What happened with the sketch?
4580440	4582440	I think we're finished.
4582440	4584440	This is still it?
4584440	4586440	Now we're on the plane.
4586440	4592440	Possibly the whole drive-through thing was a fantasy while you were 35,000 feet above the planet.
4592440	4594440	I was always in the scene.
4594440	4596440	Okay, okay.
4596440	4598440	I'm sorry, sir.
4598440	4600440	Meanwhile, in the cockpit.
4600440	4602440	Shh.
4602440	4604440	Shh.
4604440	4606440	Shh.
4606440	4608440	Shh.
4608440	4610440	Shh.
4610440	4614440	Ladies and gentlemen, once again, I remind you, you're on an airplane.
4614440	4616440	No control of your life.
4616440	4618440	I sit in a black metal tube.
4618440	4619440	I'm flying around.
4619440	4621440	My name is Captain Jenkins.
4621440	4623440	What the fuck?
4623440	4625440	What the fuck?
4625440	4626440	What the fuck?
4626440	4628440	What's your shit?
4629440	4632440	Ladies and gentlemen, everything's fine.
4632440	4634440	What the fuck?
4634440	4636440	What the fuck?
4636440	4638440	Let me touch you.
4638440	4640440	Let me touch you.
4640440	4642440	Let me touch you, please.
4642440	4644440	Let me touch you.
4644440	4646440	Let me touch you, please.
4646440	4648440	I've been waiting my whole life.
4648440	4650440	I snuck in from the baggage.
4650440	4652440	You can't get in a cockpit.
4652440	4656440	I snuck in from the baggage.
4656440	4658440	I snuck in from the baggage.
4658440	4660440	Let me touch.
4660440	4662440	The door's locked.
4662440	4664440	Captain, is everything okay in there?
4664440	4666440	We're busy.
4666440	4668440	Okay, I'll come back later, Captain.
4668440	4670440	No, Maggie, Maggie.
4670440	4672440	Let me just touch you once and I'll go.
4672440	4674440	I promise.
4674440	4676440	Let me touch you once and I'll go.
4676440	4678440	You shouldn't be alive.
4678440	4680440	You're not even sitting in real space.
4680440	4682440	I know.
4682440	4684440	Let me touch you once and I'll go home.
4684440	4686440	Shh, shh, shh, shh.
4686440	4688440	Suck, suck off.
4688440	4700440	You like, you like it, don't you?
4700440	4702440	You like it.
4702440	4704440	You like it, you like it.
4704440	4706440	You like it.
4706440	4708440	Stick your thumb in my mouth.
4710440	4712440	Stick to it once and I'll go.
4713440	4715440	You're my imaginary friend.
4715440	4718440	You remember.
4718440	4720440	But you're not real.
4720440	4722440	No.
4722440	4724440	But I'm here.
4726440	4728440	Flashback.
4728440	4730440	Ny, ny, ny, ny, ny.
4730440	4732440	Ny, ny, ny, ny, ny.
4732440	4734440	Ny, ny, ny, ny.
4734440	4736440	Chyron, 1975.
4736440	4740440	Smoke on the water.
4741440	4744440	Tom Clancy Chyron.
4744440	4748440	Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff,
4748440	4750440	Johnson Summer Camp.
4750440	4752440	Fuck.
4752440	4754440	Fuck you, Harmon.
4754440	4756440	Interior cabin.
4756440	4759440	And that's how you fold a shirt.
4761440	4764440	Hey, who are you bunking with?
4764440	4767440	Oh, nobody really likes me.
4767440	4769440	I just tell people how to fold shirts.
4769440	4773440	I probably shouldn't complain about my lack of popularity.
4773440	4775440	I don't have a bunk mate.
4775440	4777440	I don't have a bunk mate.
4777440	4779440	My name's Captain...
4781440	4785440	I hope one day...
4785440	4787440	Captain Dan Harmon.
4791440	4795440	One day I'm going to be in charge of all the clouds.
4796440	4798440	I know you will.
4798440	4800440	I know you will.
4800440	4802440	Captain Harmon,
4802440	4804440	will you be my bunk mate?
4806440	4808440	Bunk mate?
4808440	4810440	Will you be my bunk mate?
4810440	4812440	Hey! Hey!
4812440	4814440	I said lights up.
4814440	4817440	You guys have to pick a bunk mate and get to bed.
4817440	4819440	I'm going to sit.
4819440	4821440	This is Jeff Johnson's Summer Camp.
4821440	4823440	I want a tight chip.
4823440	4826440	I'm going to set the drapes on fire.
4826440	4828440	No. Oh no.
4830440	4832440	Oh no!
4832440	4834440	Oh no!
4834440	4836440	You did it.
4836440	4838440	You did it.
4838440	4840440	What? No.
4846440	4848440	Mama!
4848440	4850440	Mama!
4850440	4852440	Mama!
4852440	4854440	Mama!
4854440	4856440	Mama!
4856440	4858440	Mama!
4858440	4860440	Mama!
4860440	4862440	Mama!
4862440	4864440	Mama!
4864440	4866440	Get out of the fire!
4866440	4868440	Get out of the fire!
4870440	4872440	Do I have to do everything?
4872440	4874440	Mama!
4874440	4876440	Mama!
4876440	4878440	Thank you.
4878440	4880440	Thank you very much.
4880440	4882440	Thank you for doing this.
4882440	4884440	Did you just stand in the fire?
4884440	4886440	Thank you.
4886440	4890440	For a second I was animatronic for a second.
4890440	4893440	Now I'm back to normal.
4893440	4895440	Two years.
4895440	4898440	Go ahead. You were going to cut to the meat.
4898440	4900440	No. No. No. No. No. No.
4900440	4902440	Are you okay?
4902440	4904440	I'll be fine. Go ahead. Cut to the meat.
4904440	4906440	Are you sure? What's your name?
4906440	4908440	My name is Cletus.
4908440	4910440	Tell me about yourself.
4910440	4914440	I'm physically disfigured now for the rest of my life.
4914440	4916440	Captain Harmon, what the hell is going on?
4916440	4918440	I told you guys lights out.
4918440	4920440	Sir, he lights up.
4920440	4922440	He lit everything on fire.
4922440	4924440	Why are my curtains burned?
4924440	4927440	What did you do to Cletus's face?
4927440	4929440	Um, hello.
4929440	4931440	The curtains can be replaced.
4931440	4933440	Oh.
4934440	4936440	Sir.
4936440	4939440	Whenever such curtains have fire, sir.
4939440	4943440	Sir, it's unclear to me if Cletus exists or not.
4943440	4946440	No. I exist. I exist.
4946440	4949440	Well, Cletus says that that he would...
4949440	4953440	I don't know. I think you guys should cut to two years later and find out.
4955440	4959440	Sir, before we go to two years later, I just...
4959440	4965440	There must be a reason we touched in here to say that I wish I was a good pilot.
4965440	4969440	Yeah. You want to be in command of all the clouds.
4969440	4973440	Yes, sir. Yes, sir, sir. Command on clouds, sir.
4973440	4979440	If you think the best path to commanding all the clouds is to set your bunkmate on fire,
4979440	4981440	well, you've got another thing coming, mister.
4981440	4985440	Sir, Pilot Harmon has no bunkmate, sir.
4985440	4988440	Pilot Harmon is in charge of his own destiny.
4989440	4992440	That's what you think.
4992440	4995440	Ooh.
4996440	4999440	You're in my domain now.
4999440	5003440	Come on. Let's go meet the Gelflings.
5007440	5011440	You're never going to flash back to the present, ever.
5011440	5015440	Ever. You're never going to flash back to the present.
5015440	5017440	You're going to stay here with me.
5017440	5019440	Ooh, Cletus, who is your friend?
5019440	5021440	Oh, hello, Lord Gelfling.
5021440	5023440	Nice to meet you.
5023440	5024440	Lord Gelfling.
5024440	5027440	And Cletus, what happened to your beautiful face?
5027440	5028440	It does all burn, don't it?
5028440	5032440	I'm a different character, but my face is beautiful.
5032440	5035440	Okay, I'm sorry. You reminded me of a flashback I was at.
5035440	5040440	Cletus is all fucked up and melted derma wax face.
5040440	5043440	Look at this angel.
5043440	5044440	These are...
5044440	5045440	Look at this angel.
5045440	5048440	He looks like somebody who could command a cloud.
5048440	5049440	Yeah.
5049440	5052440	We are having trouble with the clouds.
5052440	5054440	We've lost all control of our clouds.
5054440	5056440	The clouds rain on our parade.
5056440	5058440	We have a parade?
5058440	5060440	That's how we make power.
5060440	5062440	We've looked at them from both sides now.
5062440	5065440	From up and down and still somehow.
5065440	5067440	Cloud illusion, I recall.
5067440	5070440	I really don't know clouds at all.
5070440	5073440	Joni Mitchell reference.
5073440	5076440	No!
5076440	5079440	The clouds have rained!
5079440	5083440	You can command the clouds, make the rain go away.
5083440	5086440	I'd like to go home.
5086440	5089440	And I find you racist.
5089440	5094440	Are you refusing this, Kong?
5094440	5096440	Wait, we are only in act one?
5096440	5097440	Tick.
5097440	5099440	If I am, we're in bitch trouble.
5099440	5101440	It's a flashback. What did you want?
5102440	5104440	Look.
5104440	5106440	All right?
5106440	5108440	Yes, I am.
5108440	5109440	Okay.
5109440	5114440	Then I guess I can't persuade you to stay.
5114440	5116440	Can I go home?
5116440	5119440	No!
5119440	5121440	Yes.
5121440	5124440	Where do I go?
5124440	5127440	He wants to know where to go!
5127440	5129440	Through the clouds!
5129440	5130440	I'll find it, I'll find it.
5130440	5131440	Through the clouds!
5131440	5132440	I'm not even listening to you.
5132440	5133440	Through the clouds!
5133440	5134440	I can't hear you.
5134440	5135440	I can't hear you.
5135440	5136440	I can't hear you.
5136440	5137440	Whoa!
5137440	5138440	Wait!
5138440	5139440	Whoa!
5139440	5144440	I can only go back so far.
5144440	5153440	You have a button open on your shirt.
5153440	5154440	Fat shaming.
5154440	5155440	It'll get...
5155440	5157440	It gets cold up there.
5157440	5161440	You might want to button your shirt.
5161440	5168440	All the way to the bottom.
5168440	5169440	No one's looking.
5169440	5172440	You can button your shirt now.
5172440	5173440	Just go ahead.
5173440	5175440	One button.
5175440	5178440	No one will judge you.
5182440	5185440	You have been blocked.
5185440	5186440	The power.
5186440	5192440	Of the button.
5192440	5196440	Use this power well.
5201440	5202440	Okay.
5202440	5204440	I will.
5204440	5207440	Anything else while I'm up?
5207440	5209440	Oh, I didn't even...
5209440	5210440	Okay.
5210440	5211440	All right.
5211440	5213440	I'm going back to my office.
5213440	5214440	Okay.
5223440	5224440	Oh, shit.
5224440	5227440	Here's the top of a beanstalk.
5234440	5236440	Put it out of your mind.
5236440	5237440	I don't...
5237440	5238440	I don't...
5238440	5239440	Okay.
5239440	5240440	That's not...
5240440	5251440	Who's climbing my spine?
5256440	5257440	I'm...
5257440	5260440	I am...
5260440	5263440	Who is I am?
5264440	5265440	Wait.
5265440	5266440	Wait.
5266440	5267440	Don't go.
5267440	5268440	Don't go.
5268440	5269440	It's fun up here.
5269440	5270440	Just...
5270440	5271440	You're not even going to...
5271440	5272440	Okay.
5272440	5273440	What?
5273440	5274440	What?
5274440	5275440	You're not even going to try?
5275440	5276440	You don't even...
5276440	5278440	I said to try.
5278440	5280440	I don't know where you are.
5280440	5281440	I'm up.
5281440	5282440	You saw a sheep.
5282440	5283440	I'm up.
5283440	5284440	I'm above you.
5284440	5286440	You're climbing my vine.
5286440	5287440	All right.
5287440	5289440	Well, thank you for letting me climb it.
5289440	5290440	My name's Dan Harmon.
5290440	5292440	I've been through a lot today.
5293440	5299440	I'm just trying to get down from the cloud world.
5299440	5302440	And beyond that, I can't really remember.
5302440	5303440	Oh.
5303440	5307440	If you want to get down, that's easy.
5322440	5323440	Hello.
5323440	5324440	Hello.
5324440	5325440	Welcome.
5325440	5338440	Welcome to Andromeda Stray.
5339440	5343440	Welcome to Andromeda Stray.
5351440	5356440	These are the special extras of Michael Crichton's Andromeda Stray.
5359440	5364440	Would you like to see a BTS of Andromeda Stray?
5365440	5368440	And how they did it?
5369440	5370440	Yes.
5370440	5372440	Press play.
5382440	5385440	Hi, I'm Michael Crichton.
5387440	5389440	You know what's weird? Science.
5390440	5393440	Science is strange.
5393440	5395440	Freaks me out. I can't sleep at night.
5395440	5397440	My wife gets pissed off at me.
5397440	5399440	So I write these books.
5399440	5401440	I don't know.
5401440	5405440	What do you do to get over your problems?
5405440	5409440	Anyway, I wrote this story called Andromeda Stray.
5409440	5417440	About a person named Andromeda who is just like going under a tremendous difficulty in his life.
5419440	5421440	Just a lot of strain in his life.
5421440	5423440	And he's trying to figure out what's going on.
5423440	5425440	And so, you know, he's like...
5425440	5426440	That's the worst.
5426440	5429440	I'm going to watch the original theatrical trailer.
5429440	5431440	The original theatrical trailer.
5433440	5441440	20th Century Fox proudly presents Michael Crichton's Andromeda Stray.
5441440	5443440	Are you kidding me?
5443440	5447440	These goats can't fly?
5448440	5450440	If they don't, someone else's will.
5451440	5453440	Andromeda Stray.
5455440	5457440	Your lab results are inaccurate.
5457440	5460440	Your personality is inaccurate too.
5460440	5462440	Andromeda Stray.
5463440	5465440	I can't feel my passion.
5465440	5467440	Why don't you feel my dick?
5468440	5470440	Andromeda Stray.
5471440	5473440	The Chinese are everywhere.
5473440	5475440	Tell him to button his button.
5478440	5480440	Andromeda Stray.
5481440	5485440	Run like you've got a pair.
5487440	5489440	Father, what in heaven?
5489440	5491440	Hello, beyond it.
5491440	5492440	Andromeda?
5492440	5494440	Andromeda, you're fired.
5494440	5495440	A doll.
5495440	5497440	Stray.
5497440	5498440	Thanksgiving.
5507440	5511440	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
5511440	5512440	Thanksgiving.
5512440	5515440	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
5515440	5519440	Stray just got a new first name name.
5524440	5525440	That's good.
5530440	5533440	Our biggest fan just walked out.
5533440	5536440	She's had a lot to drink.
5537440	5539440	She's a Hillary voter.
5539440	5541440	It's not her demographic.
5541440	5542440	Bullshit.
5542440	5544440	I'm done with this.
5544440	5546440	I've had enough of this bullshit.
5546440	5548440	I'm going to take a pith.
5549440	5550440	Monica, don't.
5550440	5552440	I'm going to take a pith right now.
5553440	5556440	We're watching the Andromeda Stray, right?
5556440	5557440	You and I?
5557440	5559440	No, I'm taking a pith.
5560440	5562440	Okay, but I'm just mean.
5562440	5563440	I'm taking a pith.
5563440	5564440	Okay.
5564440	5565440	Hey, Monica.
5565440	5566440	Yes?
5567440	5571440	Go ahead and pith, but I wanted to talk to you through the closed bathroom door.
5571440	5573440	We'll come this way.
5575440	5578440	We can't just keep doing this, right?
5580440	5583440	Let's go back to talking about politics.
5583440	5584440	Oh, no, okay.
5584440	5587440	Anyway, I can't do that.
5587440	5588440	You know that.
5588440	5590440	Well, now you've spoiled it.
5590440	5591440	Yeah.
5591440	5592440	I thought this was what you like to do.
5592440	5594440	I'm just trying to make you happy.
5594440	5595440	I did it.
5595440	5597440	I tried talking to women about women.
5598440	5599440	You're haunting the place.
5599440	5601440	I'm like, Phantom of the Opera.
5602440	5603440	You're leaving.
5603440	5604440	You're going to make lego movies.
5604440	5607440	I want to know more about that beanstalk goat.
5608440	5610440	Was he like a guardian of the beanstalk?
5611440	5615440	I pictured him as some kind of Doctor Snuggles-like kind of creature
5615440	5620440	with a long vine growing out of his chin.
5620440	5621440	Oh, so the vine didn't grow out of the ground.
5621440	5625440	It's actually dangling from the chin of a giant cosmic goat.
5625440	5626440	Right.
5626440	5627440	It's cool.
5627440	5628440	There's your movie.
5629440	5630440	Cosmic goat.
5630440	5632440	Cosmic goat.
5632440	5633440	All right.
5633440	5636440	Well, what did we learn tonight?
5638440	5641440	Here, we'll do a role-playing thing, but I'll be Spencer.
5641440	5642440	All right.
5642440	5643440	Let's do it.
5643440	5645440	Do you have a game platform for us, or are you going to freestyle?
5645440	5647440	We're going to play laser.
5647440	5648440	Oh, wait.
5648440	5649440	That's already used comedically.
5649440	5650440	We're going to play...
5650440	5652440	Gamma world.
5652440	5654440	Gamma wild.
5654440	5655440	We're going to play...
5655440	5656440	Gamma wild.
5656440	5657440	Gamma potato.
5657440	5658440	Dan and potato.
5658440	5660440	Let's play cosmic goat.
5661440	5662440	All right.
5662440	5663440	Here we go.
5663440	5666440	Dan, do you want some Spencer theme music to start his offer?
5666440	5667440	Yeah.
5667440	5668440	All right.
5668440	5669440	Let's see what I got here.
5670440	5671440	Cosmic goat.
5671440	5672440	Here we go.
5674440	5677440	In the world of gamma potato.
5678440	5681440	The world is older than you've ever known.
5684440	5685440	Give me a second.
5686440	5687440	I'm glad you could join us.
5689440	5691440	Potatoes are the only thing...
5691440	5693440	That seems overtly comical.
5695440	5697440	I don't want to do that, the potato thing.
5697440	5699440	It seems like the piranha 3D thing.
5699440	5700440	It's like, I don't want to do that.
5700440	5701440	Gamma world.
5701440	5702440	Just...
5703440	5704440	All right.
5704440	5708440	I'll just make it a regular...
5708440	5709440	Shadow run.
5709440	5711440	Reality.
5712440	5713440	No, real...
5713440	5714440	Give me a second.
5716440	5717440	Super...
5717440	5718440	No, no, no.
5718440	5719440	I can beat that.
5719440	5720440	No?
5720440	5721440	Okay.
5722440	5723440	Christ...
5723440	5724440	Christ...
5724440	5725440	Christ Wars.
5728440	5729440	All right.
5729440	5730440	Now I'm in.
5730440	5731440	Okay, okay, okay.
5731440	5732440	I got it.
5732440	5733440	I got it.
5733440	5736440	I will be the cross of ice.
5736440	5737440	No, no, no.
5737440	5738440	I'm going to...
5738440	5739440	Let him set it up for us.
5739440	5740440	Yeah, yeah.
5740440	5741440	I'm going to let you make your character.
5741440	5742440	I won't.
5742440	5743440	I'm going to let you make your characters in a second.
5743440	5744440	Okay?
5744440	5745440	Okay.
5745440	5750440	The two of you have just woken up in a featureless room.
5750440	5752440	Six feet by six feet.
5752440	5759440	A sealed door, although you don't know it's sealed yet, is on each wall for a total of
5759440	5760440	four doors.
5761440	5765440	You are both naked, save for a loin cloth.
5765440	5768440	You have holes in your hands and feet.
5770440	5779440	You look the same except for certain distinguishing tattoos on your right and or left biceps.
5779440	5784440	This is your time to introduce yourselves to each other as you wake up on the floor of
5784440	5786440	this featureless room.
5787440	5789440	Jeff, it's your turn.
5791440	5793440	What's up?
5797440	5799440	My name is...
5801440	5802440	Jesus.
5806440	5811440	Rob, your character is perceiving a person standing next to you, saying these things
5811440	5814440	to you, and he's just saying these things.
5815440	5817440	I have a tattoo of an olive branch on my right bicep.
5817440	5820440	I see you have one on your left bicep.
5821440	5822440	Yes, I do.
5823440	5824440	What's your name?
5824440	5825440	Jesus.
5828440	5832440	Rob, you feel a burning sensation in your head.
5832440	5834440	Yeah, yeah.
5834440	5839440	Your ancestors are saying to you in the form of a cat, you see a cat in front of you who's
5839440	5844440	wreathed in flame, and he says, don't do that, just don't do that, don't do that, don't do
5844440	5845440	that.
5847440	5849440	You take 12 damage.
5854440	5860440	I should tell you guys, there's a series of lights in the corners of each corner.
5860440	5866440	There's a blue light alternately symmetrical with a red light and a yellow light, and
5866440	5871440	there's an alternating pattern going across in the form of like a reverse cross, like
5871440	5877440	a Mercedes symbol, but like flipping back and forth as each time the ceiling rotates,
5877440	5881440	there's red, yellow light, and a blue light, and then a green light.
5881440	5885440	In the center of the room, there's an orange crystal.
5887440	5891440	I pick up the cat and using my unarmed combat.
5891440	5893440	You can't pick up a cat.
5893440	5895440	How do you pick up a cat?
5895440	5897440	I have plus 22 agility.
5897440	5899440	You don't see a cat.
5899440	5902440	There's no cat there to your knowledge.
5902440	5905440	Wasn't there a cat telling him what to do?
5905440	5907440	Rob's cat, you don't know.
5907440	5908440	Okay.
5908440	5909440	It's a hallucinatory cat.
5909440	5915440	All right, then I use unarmed combat, and I frontal kick Jesus right in the chest.
5915440	5917440	Ah, fuck, ow.
5919440	5923440	I go, die for my sins.
5923440	5924440	What?
5924440	5931440	He gives 17 damage as his foot caves into your sternum, and his heel like sinks into your sternum.
5931440	5933440	Oh, Jesus.
5933440	5934440	And his sternum...
5934440	5936440	That's my name.
5937440	5941440	The two of you are in a very strange situation at this point.
5941440	5947440	The ceiling starts to unscrew like a cork, or like a cap on a cork bottle,
5947440	5952440	and it goes up as it spins around, and it goes up.
5952440	5961440	And a giant character says, I want to talk to you about being God.
5961440	5964440	You look up and you see a character.
5964440	5967440	His head is the size of Pluto.
5967440	5969440	His eyes are each planet's.
5969440	5974440	His mouth talks with a giant cave-like venom.
5974440	5981440	And he says, I want the ruby of Remarkacon, and I'll stop at nothing to get it.
5981440	5986440	He creates a wreath of flame, and the wreath of flame cries out.
5986440	5989440	You each need to save versus burning.
5989440	5992440	You both fail to save versus burning.
5992440	5994440	I haven't had a turn yet.
5994440	5996440	You're both on fire right now.
5996440	5997440	I am on fire.
5997440	5999440	I haven't had a turn yet.
5999440	6000440	I have trap sense.
6000440	6002440	Did you roll my trap sense?
6002440	6003440	Trap sense?
6003440	6007440	You sense that there are such a thing as traps in the universe.
6007440	6008440	A good one.
6008440	6014440	Vorthamamacon says, I'm going to do this.
6014440	6018440	His hand comes out, and it's the size of eight million worlds.
6018440	6020440	You're all being pulled into it.
6020440	6023440	You're all inside a giant hand.
6023440	6028440	A finger comes inside that hand, and you open a door on the tip of that finger,
6028440	6030440	and you go into that finger.
6030440	6035440	Now you're inside a big black space, and there's an orange dot in the northwest corner,
6035440	6041440	a green dot five meters from that, another orange dot in the center of the ceiling.
6041440	6045440	The whole thing is shaped like an egg, but with a pyramid on top of it,
6045440	6047440	there's two lights that flash.
6047440	6051440	In this order, green, green, red, red, green, green, blue,
6051440	6057440	and there's a cash register in the center of the room doing a Pokemon reference.
6057440	6061440	I turn to Hey Susan and say, I know this one.
6062440	6065440	Why did you kick me so hard?
6065440	6069440	Because it's crazed wars, but I realized just after this whole thing happened,
6069440	6071440	we had to find the Ruby of Demorjicon.
6071440	6073440	Can I have my clothes back?
6073440	6078440	I give you back your line class under one condition, that we worked together to defeat.
6078440	6083440	You kicked me in the chest and took my clothes.
6083440	6085440	Because it's crazed wars.
6085440	6086440	Worked together?
6086440	6087440	Now we're working together.
6087440	6090440	You're telling me to work together after you kicked me in the chest?
6090440	6093440	And took my clothes.
6093440	6096440	Turn the other chest and let's work together.
6096440	6101440	While you guys are talking, the sky is crushing you.
6101440	6106440	I reach into my butt and I pull out a ruby.
6106440	6109440	Okay, you do that.
6109440	6110440	That happens.
6110440	6111440	I hold it aloft.
6111440	6114440	I still haven't had a turn.
6114440	6116440	You've had like nine turns.
6116440	6118440	This is free action stuff.
6118440	6120440	We're not in combat really, I don't think.
6120440	6125440	I push you over, take the ruby, give it to him and leave.
6125440	6127440	I just did that.
6127440	6129440	It just happened.
6129440	6130440	I'm sorry.
6130440	6131440	It happened.
6131440	6132440	It just happened.
6132440	6134440	Open the door.
6134440	6136440	I'm knocking home.
6136440	6138440	Open the door.
6138440	6140440	It skips you.
6140440	6141440	Blackness folds around you.
6141440	6145440	The both of you feel like sandwiches inside a toaster.
6145440	6147440	There's blackness around you.
6147440	6151440	You can't move or speak for the next seven and a half minutes.
6151440	6154440	The eternity is keeping you from doing anything.
6154440	6164440	I cast toaster speech.
6164440	6167440	Okay, you do that.
6167440	6171440	Nothing happens.
6171440	6175440	Blackness continues to surround you.
6175440	6177440	Eternity moves into night.
6177440	6179440	Red lights become blue lights.
6179440	6181440	And you move into a new realm.
6181440	6182440	You look around you.
6182440	6185440	It looks like there's a yellow world.
6185440	6186440	It's all yellow.
6186440	6187440	Everything's yellow.
6187440	6189440	Everything you look around and it's yellow.
6189440	6192440	And there's flowers and it feels very yellow.
6192440	6194440	And a guy comes up to you and goes like,
6194440	6200440	hey, can I get you a pack, man?
6200440	6201440	I'll take a pack.
6201440	6202440	Can we talk now?
6202440	6204440	You guys are taking damage.
6204440	6206440	I'll take one pack.
6206440	6207440	Oh, okay.
6207440	6209440	You get healed for a thousand points.
6209440	6210440	Thank you.
6210440	6212440	Oh, shit.
6212440	6213440	Oh, shit.
6213440	6214440	I'm all healed.
6214440	6215440	Fuck.
6215440	6216440	Fuck.
6216440	6220440	One of my holds is totally healed.
6220440	6222440	Are there any exits available to me?
6222440	6224440	There are two exits.
6224440	6225440	Everything's an exit.
6225440	6228440	I take both of them.
6229440	6231440	Technically speaking, everything's an exit.
6231440	6233440	All right.
6239440	6242440	Am I still just wearing a loincloth?
6242440	6244440	You don't wear a loincloth.
6244440	6245440	It's a loincloth.
6245440	6247440	It's around your loins.
6247440	6249440	Okay.
6249440	6251440	Is the god figure the second?
6251440	6252440	Is he visible?
6252440	6254440	Is he like...
6254440	6255440	A god isn't a figure.
6255440	6257440	Is it a god or a figure?
6258440	6260440	Okay.
6261440	6269440	I use arcane knowledge to read the surroundings.
6269440	6271440	What does that mean?
6271440	6273440	Tell me what you're doing.
6273440	6275440	Do you have arcane knowledge?
6275440	6278440	What arcane knowledge are you speaking of?
6278440	6283440	To see if I can read like runes or anything on the walls or anything.
6283440	6284440	Okay.
6284440	6288440	A serpent is eating you.
6288440	6290440	As it sinks its teeth into you.
6290440	6297440	I cast Christlike Surrender and let him eat me.
6297440	6305440	I push his head into the mouth of the snake.
6305440	6306440	I help him.
6306440	6308440	And I say to the snake, I'm being eaten.
6308440	6309440	I help him.
6309440	6312440	By doing this, I will be sitting at the right hand of my father.
6313440	6314440	I help him.
6314440	6315440	I help him.
6315440	6316440	I'm pushing.
6316440	6317440	I'm pushing as hard as I can.
6317440	6320440	I negate my own ego and my five senses.
6320440	6321440	I'm helping him negate it.
6321440	6325440	And by that, I attain apotheosis and I transcend.
6325440	6328440	I'm pushing him into that.
6328440	6330440	That happens.
6331440	6334440	You all do everything that you just described.
6334440	6340440	And as the mouth opens up, you see a sunrise coming up over an orange field of weight and grain.
6340440	6341440	So beautiful.
6341440	6342440	I love it.
6342440	6344440	A lone black figure bounds up.
6344440	6346440	But he has a horn on his head.
6346440	6350440	And he says, I'll give you whatever you want.
6350440	6353440	My name's Nabisco.
6354440	6355440	Nabisco?
6355440	6357440	Do you have any Triscuits?
6358440	6360440	I have lots of Triscuits.
6360440	6364440	Nabisco, can I have a Triscuit?
6365440	6367440	What's your dexterity?
6368440	6371440	You're dying.
6371440	6373440	I don't care.
6373440	6374440	You're dead.
6374440	6375440	I don't care.
6375440	6376440	I don't care either.
6376440	6377440	You're dead.
6377440	6378440	I am.
6378440	6379440	That happened.
6379440	6380440	You're dead.
6380440	6381440	You're dead, too.
6381440	6382440	You're dead.
6382440	6383440	No, I'm not.
6383440	6384440	Yeah, you are.
6384440	6385440	No.
6385440	6386440	Yeah, you are.
6386440	6387440	No, he's right.
6387440	6388440	You're dead, too.
6388440	6389440	You're so dead, man.
6389440	6390440	No, I'm not.
6390440	6391440	I'm sitting at the right hand of Snake God.
6391440	6392440	I'm looking at you.
6392440	6393440	You're in heaven.
6393440	6394440	I'm looking at a dead guy.
6394440	6395440	This is the best place ever.
6395440	6396440	No.
6396440	6397440	You got Creepshow.
6397440	6398440	No.
6398440	6399440	Yes.
6399440	6400440	You got Creepshow, motherfucker.
6400440	6401440	No!
6404440	6406440	Would you like more Diet Dog to pepper us, sir?
6406440	6407440	You fucking can't.
6407440	6409440	You fucking...
6409440	6410440	Make an order.
6410440	6411440	You fucking clogging up the queue.
6411440	6413440	There's 18 cars behind you.
6413440	6414440	We haven't got our fucking day.
6414440	6416440	I said we weren't closing.
6417440	6420440	I'm late for a game.
6421440	6423440	I just want a burger.
6424440	6427440	I was a dungeon master.
6427440	6428440	A master.
6428440	6429440	Yeah.
6429440	6430440	Yeah, right.
6430440	6431440	Sure you were.
6431440	6433440	And I'm Jackie Robinson.
6435440	6436440	You are.
6436440	6438440	You are Jackie Robinson.
6438440	6439440	Oh!
6439440	6440440	And you!
6440440	6443440	You're that rich-hearted boy I saved from that coal mine.
6444440	6452440	Everyone in this room is from a previous episode of the show that I star in, where I leap from life to life.
6454440	6456440	There's only one explanation.
6456440	6458440	This is heaven.
6458440	6460440	This is heaven.
6463440	6465440	I don't want me to put you out.
6465440	6467440	It's heaven.
6467440	6470440	I go to the bathroom.
6470440	6472440	You walk into the bathroom.
6472440	6474440	The bathroom has three toilets.
6474440	6478440	One toilet is green and one toilet is a lighter green.
6478440	6480440	One toilet is like a sea foam green.
6480440	6483440	There's no line in the heavenly bathroom.
6483440	6485440	Please, this way.
6485440	6486440	Let me open.
6486440	6488440	Give me your hand.
6490440	6494440	Use the three seashells and go to the bathroom.
6494440	6497440	You guys are doing two different bits.
6497440	6501440	In heaven, bits are in tandem.
6504440	6506440	I go to the bathroom.
6506440	6507440	You do that.
6507440	6508440	I make a pee.
6508440	6510440	You make a pee.
6510440	6512440	I use the three seashells.
6512440	6514440	Which one do you use?
6514440	6515440	The third one.
6515440	6517440	The sea foam green one?
6517440	6521440	Underneath the third seashell is a peanut.
6522440	6524440	That happens.
6525440	6527440	I leave the bathroom.
6527440	6530440	And I notice that something strange is going on.
6530440	6532440	There's something strange going on.
6532440	6534440	There's something strange going on.
6534440	6536440	I'm drying my hands, man.
6536440	6537440	That's all I'm doing.
6537440	6539440	Just drying my hands.
6539440	6541440	Something strange is going on.
6541440	6542440	It's drying their hands.
6542440	6544440	They're just drying their hands.
6544440	6546440	They're drying their hands.
6546440	6547440	Just drying my hands.
6547440	6548440	You see a man.
6548440	6552440	He's a small elven figure in a cloak.
6552440	6554440	And he's drying his hands.
6554440	6557440	I already know what I see.
6557440	6559440	Who are you?
6559440	6561440	I'm the bathroom attendant.
6561440	6563440	Would you like a tic-tac?
6563440	6565440	I'm the dungeon master.
6565440	6567440	And it starts turning into a troll.
6567440	6568440	What do you do?
6568440	6569440	Who are you?
6569440	6570440	You can't...
6570440	6571440	I'm another dungeon master.
6571440	6573440	Why, you can't...
6573440	6575440	That doesn't happen.
6575440	6576440	Yes, it does.
6576440	6578440	That does happen.
6578440	6581440	The bathroom attendant turns into a troll
6581440	6583440	and starts eating your neck.
6583440	6585440	That happens.
6585440	6586440	You need to tell me.
6586440	6588440	I'm your neck.
6588440	6589440	I'm your neck.
6589440	6590440	I'm also a dungeon master.
6590440	6591440	No.
6591440	6593440	This one has a tic-tac and it passes through.
6593440	6594440	That happens.
6594440	6598440	I bring out my sword and I charge both of you
6598440	6600440	with my sword, which is two dungeon masters.
6600440	6603440	The sword has to roll a five or greater.
6603440	6605440	This is part one of the sword.
6605440	6607440	I'm a dungeon master.
6607440	6610440	That happens.
6610440	6612440	This is part two of the sword.
6612440	6615440	I'm also a dungeon master.
6615440	6618440	That doesn't happen.
6618440	6621440	My sword is immobile.
6621440	6623440	That's what happens.
6623440	6625440	That happens.
6625440	6627440	I said it didn't happen.
6627440	6629440	Yeah, I said it did.
6632440	6634440	You seem to be in a strange situation.
6634440	6636440	There's dungeon masters everywhere
6636440	6639440	saying that's happening, but something's not happening.
6639440	6641440	The movie is about to start.
6641440	6644440	The lights are flickering up and down.
6646440	6650440	Are you going to go make it in time?
6653440	6655440	Yes.
6655440	6658440	You sit down
6658440	6663440	and you watch a trailer for Norm of the North
6663440	6668440	and watch the Revenant.
6668440	6672440	I pull a mirror out of my pocket and look into it.
6672440	6674440	That happens.
6674440	6677440	In the mirror you see a dungeon master.
6677440	6680440	It's me.
6680440	6681440	Hey.
6681440	6683440	Why isn't it me?
6683440	6688440	Hey, I didn't write this dungeon master.
6688440	6691440	How are you a master then?
6695440	6698440	I check the mirror for secret doors.
6700440	6703440	Checking the mirror for secret doors.
6703440	6705440	I find a secret door.
6705440	6707440	A secret door opens for the secret mirror.
6707440	6709440	I go behind the secret door.
6709440	6710440	You do that.
6710440	6713440	There's a whole chamber of mirrors
6713440	6715440	and everything's a mirror.
6715440	6718440	Hey, I'm stuck in here too.
6721440	6723440	I'm a mirror.
6723440	6725440	My name's a mirror.
6725440	6728440	One of the mirrors seems to be different from the mirrors.
6728440	6730440	The mirror is talking to you and says,
6730440	6732440	Hey, what's going on?
6732440	6735440	Hey, my name's a mirror.
6737440	6739440	You know?
6740440	6742440	Wait, wait.
6742440	6744440	Do you know what I mean?
6744440	6745440	A mirror.
6745440	6746440	My name's a mirror.
6746440	6749440	You mean a Middle Eastern mirror named a mirror.
6749440	6750440	Right.
6750440	6752440	I'm just a person named a mirror.
6752440	6753440	I got you.
6753440	6755440	I wrote this dungeon.
6755440	6759440	I just want to make sure that everybody knows that it's spelled like...
6759440	6760440	E-M-I-R.
6760440	6761440	Thank you.
6761440	6762440	Okay, good.
6762440	6765440	While this is happening, all the glass in all the room
6765440	6768440	breaks down into individual shards
6768440	6771440	and all the shards coalesce into a large thing
6771440	6773440	that's a huge person who says...
6773440	6776440	Hello, I am Gamma Potato.
6777440	6778440	Oh, shit.
6778440	6779440	What are we going to do?
6779440	6780440	I'm a mirror.
6780440	6783440	The glass shard monster looks over his shoulders
6783440	6785440	at the gamma potato voice and says,
6785440	6787440	I didn't say that.
6787440	6789440	I'm mirror shard.
6789440	6791440	I'm a mirror.
6791440	6793440	We should get along.
6793440	6797440	That happens, but it's not supposed to.
6797440	6798440	I didn't...
6798440	6799440	I'm a mirror, man.
6799440	6800440	I'm a mirror.
6800440	6804440	While this is happening, the mirror shard man
6804440	6807440	points his hands in a magical manner at both of you
6807440	6809440	and makes everything explode.
6809440	6810440	Everything explodes.
6810440	6812440	Everything you say makes you explode.
6812440	6813440	Everything explodes.
6813440	6816440	Everything explodes and you're completely alone in a black void.
6816440	6819440	Shard man, my name's a mirror.
6819440	6824440	You know, my name's a mirror
6824440	6827440	and there's a bunch of mirrors.
6827440	6829440	Yeah, okay.
6829440	6830440	Yeah.
6830440	6831440	Okay.
6831440	6832440	Kind of cool.
6832440	6834440	I don't get your point.
6834440	6835440	I don't get your point.
6835440	6839440	A mirror sounds like a mirror.
6839440	6840440	Okay.
6840440	6841440	If you say it.
6841440	6844440	He takes his mirror fist and it grows to the size
6844440	6847440	of eight million suns and it crushes around you
6847440	6851440	and it squeezes you and it makes your whole soul die.
6851440	6852440	I would think...
6852440	6855440	All of your energy goes away and you can't exist anymore
6855440	6857440	and you've never existed across all time.
6857440	6865440	You've never existed and you can't speak ever.
6865440	6867440	The mirror man rises up and says,
6867440	6869440	Now you're mine.
6869440	6872440	I finally have you now.
6872440	6876440	I've got you now.
6876440	6879440	Cliff Hanger!
6884440	6885440	Oh, yeah.
6885440	6888440	To be continued, everybody.
6888440	6894440	Let's hear it for Rob Schaub, shall we?
6894440	6897440	Zoey Lister Jones, Jr. Jones.
6897440	6900440	Thank you for joining us.
6900440	6904440	Also, The Chicago Show is coming up when?
6904440	6905440	Next Sunday?
6905440	6907440	It's next Sunday, The Chicago Show, yes.
6907440	6908440	In Chicago.
6908440	6909440	No, okay.
