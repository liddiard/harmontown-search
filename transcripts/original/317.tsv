0	8040	Hello, gang! For the Dennis E. typewriter downtown, MacArthur Park, Los Angeles, Harman
8040	18080	Town is now in session. On a rare rainy day in L.A., I love it. When it's gray in L.A.,
18080	22760	I like it that way. Let's bring out the Game Master extraordinaire, Spencer Crittenden.
22760	40160	We have a fog machine. Oh, do we? Yeah, I now have tuberculosis. Speaking of which,
40160	44600	let's bring out the mayor of Harman Town. You know him. You might like him. You might meet
44640	57040	him. His name is Dan Harman. Thank you. Very polite of you. All right. It's quite
57040	63480	smokey out here, right? Oh, yeah. Smoking. Smoking it up. Smoke machine getting rough.
63480	71280	Wrapping to the beat that's there. Wrapping without a care. Genuine apathy is what I feel.
71280	81960	Wrapping. Okay. First order of business. Let's do apologies and then corrections. Sorry for last
81960	87840	week. My part of it. Not anybody else's. What do you mean? I was blackout drunk,
87840	94760	so I had to listen. It's a fitting punishment when I'm like, look, we got together. We did
94760	99840	some ad reads at like 2.30 p.m. that day. And I knew what I was doing. I talked to my therapist
99960	104000	all about it. I'm like, you know, it's like, well, we got everything else squared away. Now that
104000	108600	you're almost a perfect person, you know, starting to talk about the drinking and talking about the
108600	113440	drinking means just that, you know, just doesn't have to be a movie of the week or demonized or
113440	120200	binary decisions or anything. Let's talk about your relationship with it. I was very personally
120200	127600	embarrassed by my own definitions last week. I couldn't put a thought together. I trampled all
127600	133240	over the Rose Garden of a new engagement by trying to say something about it that just came
133240	140200	out as me going, what if I was a slave? I don't even know what I was trying to say. It's a fitting
140200	145360	punishment that I have to listen to the episodes where I don't remember them. It's like nose and
145360	152800	shit kind of like listen to what you said. I mean, yeah, airlines are criminal organizations. There,
152800	160080	I said it. It doesn't need to be 70 minutes. I don't know why I think no one agrees with me,
160080	166080	but apparently it's just like there's a certain like line of alcohol where I just don't know
166080	173600	anyone has heard me and that I've said the thing. It's a, it's like just, I'm already normally when
173600	179400	I'm sober or a little tipsy, like I'm naturally stammery and babbly and embarrassing and
179400	187440	confessional and awkward, but I think there's a, there's a deal is broken when I come out so
187440	195320	incoherent that I may as well be like anybody. There's times though Dan, like I've known you
195320	207120	for a thousand years, that you're- Let me get a drink while you're talking. Okay. There's times when,
207280	214480	like when you're really drunk, like when I get really drunk, I cannot talk. You can talk drunk
214480	222560	and sometimes when you're saying things drunk, drunkenly to adverbize that, you still are kind
222560	228480	of making sense. And I wonder, am I just being dumb right now? Are you making a profound thought
229360	234240	or are you just- No, I probably make no sense. Yeah. And you're probably drunk too when I'm
234240	238000	drunk because we're probably drinking together because like why else would you and I be so shit
238000	244080	faced? The answer is each other. Bad for each other. We're like the opposite of a mongoose and
244080	248560	a cobra. And no, I don't mean a cobra and a mongoose. I mean- See, you're drunk. I have no
248560	255760	idea what you're talking about right now. I mean the opposite of the relationship. What does happen
255760	260880	is your metaphors get mixed into a jambalaya- Yeah, that only happens when he's drunk.
261520	265200	I want to be clear on this. Your metaphors are great. No, this is a very pithy observation. You
265200	270720	can't just invert the cobra-mongoose relationship. You end up with the exact same thing. Right.
271920	277200	You're just going to turn one person into the mongoose. I still hate each other. Yeah, exactly.
277200	282880	How drunk are you right now? Like one to a hundred? Sober as a non-Supreme Court justice. You know,
283440	288800	when in- Sober as a Kavanaugh. See, so sober that I'm doing boring
289520	294400	semi-topical, non-applicable humor. Like, oh, he's famous for beer, right?
296640	301600	Madonna's a whore and Kevorky and kills people. Yeah, I'm sober. Oh, yeah.
303600	307040	I remember Dr. Kevorky. There is a saying when people say I'm sober as a judge,
307040	309760	and I don't know if that's meant to be- That's what I meant. I was-
309760	313200	Ironic or, yeah. Yeah. I was going to say sober as a judge, and then I was like,
315040	323280	fun thing to do. It's dumb. Like, I'm not saying I'm funny when I'm sober or interesting or
323280	330080	entertaining. I'm just saying for me, it's like $5, $10, whatever you pay to listen to me talk for
330080	338800	a little while. Like, my definition of malpractice is I don't understand what you're even trying to
338800	348000	say. Like, you're just figure aiding in nonsense. Even Jeff Bridges figured out what he meant
349360	353520	at the Golden Globes. Like, he eventually- Somebody asked me recently, like,
353520	358880	what is Harbontown? Is it improv? I would just define it more as drunken malfeasance.
361360	365600	Yeah. I mean, it's self-destruction, I think, you know, like a little confession,
365600	372240	a little transparency at the risk of, you know, a little- It's like a rich man's NASCAR.
375360	378240	Technically, supposedly you don't want to see me burned to death, but
379680	382080	let's face it, what do you like watching me go in circles?
385120	391760	Yeah. Rich man's NASCAR. Okay, so that's my apology.
391760	398800	Yeah. And I don't mean I owe you an apology. I owe anybody- Well, I owe you an apology.
398800	404000	If you guys came here last week, I think if you come out, you come out in the rain or shine or
404000	409360	whatever, you leave your apartment, you're risking your life for me. It's Logan's run out there. No,
409360	413920	wait, Logan's run is totally peaceful society. You just have to voluntarily die at 30.
413920	414960	Zardoz out there.
414960	415920	Zardoz out there.
415920	423280	It's 70%. Tomorrow is a 70% chance of Zardoz.
423280	427360	It's Rollerball out there, and you're not a professional rollerballer.
427360	431200	You're one of the audience whose lives we don't really get to see. One day they will come out with
431200	435920	a sequel to Rollerball that's like a Rosencrancy, Guildenstern-y look at what it's like to be a
435920	441520	rollerball fan. Nobody knows what you're fucking talking about. I don't know about Rollerball.
441520	443680	And yet, sober as a senator.
445680	446800	Sober as a Kavanaugh.
446800	454800	Okay. Those are the apologies. Corrections. Okay. The BBC tweeted somebody. I think they tweeted Cody.
456720	460480	No, not Big Black Cock. The BBC- The news.
462560	464480	It's a porn, it's a porn to breathe.
464480	467360	Yeah, yeah. We were all thinking it.
467600	473680	Yeah. Who among us heard BBC and didn't think Big Black Cock?
477120	478240	We're all people. Let's move on.
479840	485920	The posh is not an acronym. That's another bullshit thing. Everything you hear that you
485920	490000	hear is an acronym. It's all bullshit. I should have known better. Because it was British,
490000	495520	I fell for it. I perpetuated a thing. Hopefully new friends, maybe if they come on the show.
495520	498800	But if they listen to last week's episode, they probably won't come. They'll be like-
498800	499680	Oh, I think they're coming.
500720	504800	I think they emailed the ladies I was referring to for the Red-Headed podcast. So maybe they'll
504800	508320	come. But then I thought, well, let's listen to what they probably listened to. Whoa.
510400	517680	But I heard from them and they speak with such dignified grace and poise that I just kind of
517680	522480	swallowed it and repeated it, that posh was an acronym for Port Out, Starboard Home. No,
522480	529680	it's not. It's a common, it's a myth in the great kingdom. And it's like, I remember my dad telling
529680	535760	me that fuck stood for for use of carnal knowledge. Yeah. It's just, no. It's the truest thing. There's
535760	542320	only two words that are actually acronyms. It's laser and scuba. Everything else is an urban
542320	547520	legend. There's nothing. Hey, did you know nothing's an acronym? It stands for non-official thing.
548080	555200	Tactical harmony involving no. That's what I like. I like snafu and food bar though. Yeah.
555200	561200	Those are real. Okay. No, but those are also just acronyms and not words. But that's what
561200	565920	sucks about linguistics is that like the unlike, I mean, obviously in history, there's like
565920	569680	conflicting theories and stuff, but there's generally prevailing opinions. But in linguistics,
569680	575840	linguistics is like, well, the top five things that could be the words are these and they're all like,
575840	580480	oh, it could be this guy's shoe fell off and it became the word, or it could be, it used to be
580480	584960	logos, which meant this guy's shoe that fell off. And it's just like really weird because they're
584960	589680	all like treated as like the real one, but it's like, well, it's probably not even any of these.
589680	594320	Yeah. I really, from what we really know of language, right? What we know is that the,
594320	598480	what would you call it? The, uh, refraction, if that's what, I don't know if that's what you'd
598480	602880	call it. Like, what is light going through glass? Is that refraction diffraction? Uh,
603840	611360	whatever the, the, um, the, the medium of time, uh, as language moves forward, it, it, it causes
611360	618720	so much chaos in ratio to linear logical evolution of words. Like, Oh, did you know, I can't even
618720	624240	riff an example. I'll just confuse and embarrass, but, but it just, the real stuff that we do know
624240	631200	about it, it only serves to show you that this, that the, that the logic is not linear at all
631200	636400	in terms of how language develops. I I'll riff a probably a really embarrassing example. Cause it
636400	640800	probably, but, but just lit the idea that bill is an abbreviation for William. And it's just like,
640800	645600	and every, every, every example, that's not a guy's name, like, like within our language,
645600	650960	like how, you know, well, yoke became joke became toke became bloke. Like it doesn't,
650960	655920	there is no logic to it. Uh, none of that is real. Nothing. Yoke never became joke. There's no,
655920	660640	that I'm just, I, if you, but, but, but so that suggests that the things that we have theories
660640	665440	about are probably wrong. Yeah. They're probably just the best stories that kept persisting.
666000	674160	Yeah. There's a series, I think it's by, uh, Earl Funk from Funk and Wagnalls. Uh, it is, uh,
675200	678640	I, I don't know if I'm getting the name right. If it's Earl or not, there's four
678640	684400	books, I think that are about etymology of idioms. Like, why do we say, uh,
684400	687920	bury the hatchet? Why do we say break a leg? Why do we like all these things?
687920	694640	And most of them are like, we don't, the jury is still out on that one. Uh, like we, we, we
694640	699440	think it's because of this, but here's the first time it was ever used in print. And I, I can't
699440	704640	get enough of that because there's a big debate about why it's break a leg. Right. And, and I,
704640	710320	I love that because we really don't know. I grew up with people saying like, Oh, it's the opposite
710320	712960	of good luck. Cause you're not supposed to experience superstitions in the theater. They
712960	716960	say have the, they're saying, have the opposite of a great show. So you have a good show. But then
716960	722080	you told me, no, it's like you break a leg when you bow. Uh, so they're like, and you would bow
722080	727040	if they were applauding at all. It's saying make it to the end, like get to the bow. Survive. Yeah.
727040	733280	Be more interesting than the bear stabbing down the street. Uh, hard to beat to the point where
733280	737280	you have to actually do something at the end of your play. Reading these books, because they're
737280	743200	so old. I think I used one like, you know, episode seven of, of, uh, Harman 10, where I said,
743200	750880	poor as Job's Turkey. Damn. Job's Turkey. You know, that Turkey was broke because Job lost
750880	758640	everything. Job's most prized family members were, but were fodder for a jealous God.
758640	764720	So of course his Turkey probably was pretty stringy. Yeah. Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty
764720	772080	untended. And I think that, uh, Mr. Funk said that, uh, the first time in print is that Job's
772080	776480	Turkey was so poor, it only had one leg, no feathers, and had to lean against a fence to stand up.
777840	783280	That's a, that's a bro. Why is Mr. Funk, uh, explaining what the actual, he's the idiom man.
783280	787520	He's, he's the guy that writes the book that says, well, why do we say horse feathers? Why do we say
787520	792400	heavens to Betsy? Right. But he's a bit, yeah. And so he's just being colorful. No, no, he's saying
792400	797360	here's the first evidence of this in print, uh, being poor as Job's Turkey, where he had no
797360	803680	feathers, one leg, and had to lean against a fence. I'm sorry. Who, who, who Job's Turkey.
803680	808720	Funk is referring to the first printed use of the phrase, poor as Job's Turkey, right? Yes. So that
808720	816560	person who used the phrase was explaining Job's Turkey. Yes. He was saying, he was letting you
816560	821840	know that this is the first time anyone's ever. I know what he's doing. Who the fuck is explaining
822480	828240	what I would, I would have assumed that the person that coined it was just coining it as an idiom.
828240	833200	Right. Not, not going, not writing an essay about how ill taken care of. Now let me tell you about
833200	840400	Job's boat. Let's say, let's say this thing was small. If you were reading a newspaper in 1745
840400	845840	and somebody referred to somebody being poor as Job's Turkey, right? You, you would just let that
845840	850000	pass by and that you, okay, that sounds like a broke ass Turkey. I feel like we're having
850000	856800	two different conversations here. Yeah. Who said Job, who went into this lengthy description of
856800	862320	the Turkey though? I think Earl Funk says that the first guy that ever used it said,
862320	869280	poor as Job's Turkey, comma. So when you, when you coined an idiom, you have to actually
869280	878720	show your math. You have to, you have to be like, this is, this is colder than a witch's tit, comma,
878720	886400	semi-colon, witch tits, the flesh being furthest from the body of an already
886400	896800	unaccommodating creature, equally unused, unused as witches are famously non-maternal.
898720	902800	You just keep, and then, and then, and then if it catches, if your explanation is good,
902800	906480	yeah, the, the peer review in the New England Journal of Idioms goes,
907360	915120	colder than a witch's tit. It stands. You read per Richard's Almanac.
916720	923840	He'll explain what I'm talking about. Trust me, witches tits, freezing. I don't have to explain
923840	931600	it. Look at the book. Do the medieval equivalent of googling it. You know, cold enough to freeze
931600	939360	the balls off a brass monkey. Oh yeah. Freeze the balls off a brass monkey. Yeah. Yeah. Spencer knows.
939360	946080	Oh, we all do. But what, so you're saying that beyond that, just being a clever way of saying
946080	951680	it's cold, like there's actually some logic to it. Yeah. Like a brass monkey is typically hot.
951680	956800	Oh yeah. Super hot. Because they're more conductive. Because they're way more, no,
956800	964480	they're just not kept cold enough to be frozen. The balls off of brass. It's on a sailing ship
964480	969040	where there's cannonballs and there's a rack that you keep the cannonballs in in a pyramid. And if
969040	976320	it's cold enough, the balls, the cannonballs in the rack in a pyramid, a fashion will expand and
976320	981680	crack and fly all over the, all over the deck. Okay. So that that's, it's, it's so cold. It,
981680	985440	it froze the balls off the brass monkey. And then for some reason, where's the, where's the monkey?
985440	988640	That's what it's the pyramid of balls. The monkey is the rack of where they can. Oh,
988640	992560	I didn't know that. I didn't know that was cold. Also, but there is some debate about this. We
992560	996560	don't know if that's actually why we saw that. Because all linguist history is just made up.
997520	1001520	Yeah. It's weird. I always assume, well, what time is it? Half past the monkey's ass quarter
1001520	1006320	to his balls. Like I always just assumed that a lot of our language is just made up by kids
1006320	1012480	who are like finding out how to say stuff. They're kind of like, there was a guy on MSNBC,
1012480	1016560	there was a linguist that was talking about Donald Trump's use of language. And he was like,
1016560	1022720	yeah, he's a, it's a, it's a surprisingly juvenile use of language for a senior citizen. And that's
1022720	1028960	sort of like part of his like appeal to people because it's like, he talks the way, not only the
1028960	1035840	way that we start talking when we're learning to talk, but he also talks the way our species talked
1035840	1043520	when it was learning to talk. And before it learned to speak. Speaking and talking being two
1043520	1048320	different things, but him being like a pioneer politician who's just like, kind of like a,
1048320	1051120	Duncan Trussell said something terrifying at one point about Trump, which was like,
1051120	1057040	I think he's just the first of a new breed of like politicians who are going to be like the,
1057040	1063120	your local town's carpet king, you know? Like, like you're not going to, the question is he doing a
1063120	1066800	bit or not. It's never going to matter anymore. It's going to be like part of the job, part of
1066800	1073840	the electability. You won't be able to be elected by, you know, by having poise. That would be a, a
1073840	1082160	silly person's gambit when you can, you can just stick out. And then, then only a wise person would,
1082160	1086000	would make an ass of themselves while running for president and et cetera, et cetera. It's sort of
1086000	1092160	like, if you can forecast the way, I think that's a very optimistic prediction because it's sort of,
1092240	1097360	sort of says that our country's going to be around long enough that like we're going to keep having
1097360	1104240	regular elections every four years of this. We're Venezuela now. But we're not Poland and I don't
1104240	1107920	want to bring people down, but I got to share the things that bring me down. It's just such a fucking
1107920	1114240	bummer. This mayor in Poland is like doing the charity event and that dude jumped up on stage,
1114240	1124080	stabbed him to death on the stage. And it, it, it, why am I bringing this up? I, I, it's like,
1126160	1130240	there, but for the grace of God, I don't know. We saw there were swastikas burning in the street in
1130240	1138480	Poland like a year ago. Look, we're in a worldwide right slide. America no longer has all three
1138480	1143920	branches of government on the right. How long it will last, I don't know, but all of this rhetoric,
1143920	1151600	all of this shit, I believe truly that whereas traditionally heretofore fascism's potting soil
1151600	1155920	has been multicultural shifts in economic like rollercoasters. That's when people get,
1156480	1163760	they're, they're, they're cravings for authoritarianism to start to, to get tempted. And I think that
1163760	1171760	plus Facebook is, is, is pot is going to destroy the planet because we were really not in economic
1171760	1178800	bad shape. But the, the, the arrival of the internet or rather the arrival of dumb people to
1178800	1185760	the internet, they kind of like, they'd never seen the world before. And the first thing they see
1185760	1193840	is, oh my God, there's so much more brown skin or so much more like uppity vagina or so much more
1193840	1198640	than they were used to because their world is going from everything they can see. And trust me,
1198640	1204080	as a guy who's left Twitter and now I've become much more provincial and simplified. Like I really
1204080	1208080	happens pretty quickly. Like I don't know, I don't know nothing about nothing and I'm really happy
1208080	1215120	about it. And then, and then to, so, so assuming it works in reverse as well as when our parents
1215120	1221200	got on the internet, my parents, Trump's generation, love you mom, love you dad, but Jesus Christ, like,
1221200	1227840	like it, the, the, the baby boomer plus the internet is like, it's like they reacted to it as if it was
1227840	1232400	our fault that they were racist. They were kind of like, where are all these black people doing
1232400	1238800	on my phone? And I think that happened all over the world. I can't call the police on my phone.
1238800	1243360	You can't, you can't, if you, if you, you know, in high school history class, you know, you can trace
1243360	1249120	like our sort of like the global rises of militarism, nationalism, isolationism, economic
1249120	1255440	depression and things that lead to both of the great world wars. And we didn't have that. And yet
1255440	1261280	we're repeating that blueprint without the parts that actually spoke, caused it. Like we, we skip,
1261280	1267360	it's like, it's like, it's like we, we invented a weird invisible plexiglass ramp to anti-Semitism
1267360	1272880	and scapegoating immigrants and all these things that traditionally happened because
1272880	1276960	your country has gotten to a point where it's using your currency as a doorstop or toilet paper
1276960	1282400	and, and it's using like bottle caps for money. And it like, we never got there. There was a,
1282400	1287200	there was a housing crisis and a global economic crisis and all this stuff, but we didn't,
1288240	1293760	we, we had YouTube autoplay. It's the, it's, it's, it's, it really is. It's the internet's
1293760	1298880	fuck God darn it. That's my point. No, it's the algorithms. They like, they want clicks and clicks,
1299520	1303600	you know, Nazis click unfortunately. And so it's like, yeah, you know, it sells
1303600	1308960	so making people Nazis on accident, political rhetoric. So this, this Polish mayor, 53 years
1308960	1315840	old, a mayor like myself, he was a liberal. He was outspoken. He loved his gay rights.
1315840	1319280	He was Polish. It's not a great time. I think Jeff's going to stab you, Dan.
1320000	1327920	That's not what that's not funny. That really happened. I, I, the, uh, he was, he was, he was
1327920	1333520	doing this charity event and a crazy guy that of course they're calling a lone wolf and he's crazy.
1333520	1337040	He's crazy. Yes, I agree. What are you saying? I'm going to cut you.
1338960	1344240	This isn't the funny portion of the show. I'm doing my Springer's first thoughts.
1345840	1354000	First thoughts. Uh, Springer's opening arguments. Um, it, I just, you know, I have no solutions and
1354000	1359200	I have no, I have no appeal. I, I, I will, I would die for my freedom of speech. I would die for
1359200	1363680	other people's freedom of expression. I do not believe that laws need to be created to, uh,
1363680	1367920	mitigate the way people speak. I believe that free speech have, have we noticed has consequences
1367920	1373760	anyway. Uh, uh, uh, let's talk about that weatherman that got fired for accidentally making the sound
1373760	1376960	coon while he was saying Martin Luther King's name. Let's just talk about that in a second.
1376960	1382880	Like, I mean, we, we love firing people like we, you, you, you, but unless you're a Nazi,
1382880	1390000	like, like you, if you're, if you're, I don't, we're in trouble if we continue to, um, uh,
1390000	1395360	ostracize each other and divide each other based on language, we're, we're basically handing the
1395360	1401840	opposite of kryptonite to the, to the more nihilistic, more sociopathic of, of two sides
1401840	1408880	of a political spectrum. The, the, the party that this poor mayor was the most outspoken against the
1410000	1416800	in this, in his right leading Poland, uh, they had issued death certificates for liberal politicians.
1417440	1422160	He was very outspoken about that in particular. I, can you imagine the irony? Can you imagine the,
1422160	1427680	like this guy's final thoughts as he's being stabbed in the heart in front of his constituency
1427680	1433760	and then all the cell phones are just out and like, I like it, it, the pictures are so disturbing
1433760	1441200	and confusing. It, it, I, the, the guy was the most outspoken about the, the rhetoric and how
1441200	1446640	violent it was getting and how disgusting these people who have nothing to lose and only the
1446640	1452240	mentally ill to play with. Um, and only, only, only they have nothing to lose and everything to gain
1452240	1457840	from triggering a fucking psychopath. By the way, one in a hundred people is so out of their gourd.
1457840	1463760	God bless you. Probably a disproportionate number of them in my listenership. So what we love you,
1463760	1467760	welcome. You, you, if you're psychotic, you're not automatically a murderer, but more than a hundred
1467760	1477360	people is, is, is, is, is vulnerable to fucking messaging. And we, we, we, we just got this like
1477360	1483200	weird ability to all talk to each other all the time about whatever we want. And the politicians
1483200	1488880	have arrived in that arena and they're, the thugs among them are going like, yeah, someone should
1488880	1493600	kill that bitch. Well, if that bitch then gets killed, like I, you know, we're going to keep
1493600	1498800	having this conversation. This isn't clearly about gun control. The guy, the guy crawled up
1498800	1504240	on a stage with a knife. The, the, the government was trying to say, uh, it wasn't political. We
1504240	1509760	didn't understand his motivation. He literally waved the knife around and said, I did this because
1509760	1515760	this guy's political party locked me up. He was like a mentally ill, like guy who, who had his
1515760	1520880	mentally ill life. It was in and out of prison and stuff. And he, he decided to blame this political
1520880	1529760	party that was also being told to die by these, by the opposition who were issuing like hilarious
1529760	1535840	death certificates for liberal politicians. Our now deceased mayor of this Polish town was among
1535840	1542080	the few who was going, guys, he went to his government and said, you should, you should
1542080	1546720	look at this as incitement of violence in a very dangerous time. And the government said to him,
1546720	1552400	no, it's freedom of expression. Um, it's a way of saying you disagree with someone politically
1552400	1559440	to say they should die. And then he, then he died. He was stabbed in front of everyone. So like,
1559440	1565920	I am never going to let anybody tell me what to say, but what the fuck, man? We get fired for
1565920	1571280	saying the wrong shit. Like, and we're, we're, we're extending that to everyone but politicians.
1572880	1575360	The only thing I wanted to say about that weatherman guy, by the way, it was,
1575360	1578000	I'm sure you've read that story. If I've read it, you've read it. Like,
1578880	1582400	but there was this weatherman, do you know what I'm talking about? He was trying,
1582400	1585840	he was, he was, he was speeding through. I actually didn't watch the clip. I'm inclined
1585840	1592560	to take this word for it because I don't believe, you talk on microphone. Yeah. I mean, I, I just
1592560	1598240	don't, I just don't believe that the way you find out someone's racist is like a sound coming out
1598240	1601920	of their mouth. I really don't. I mean, that's different from saying like a speech on the corner
1601920	1607280	where you reveal like, like, I think that if your skin is this color, you're a worse person
1607280	1612880	than this person. I just don't, I don't believe, I think it's a dangerous way of thinking, but also
1612880	1618320	it's, it's not like, it's not like somebody led that pack. It's sort of like, this is what we
1618320	1623840	make vulnerable people vulnerable to. I put the blame on corporations. Media corporations are,
1623840	1631680	need to stop firing people within eight hours of Twitter trending them. It has to stop. Right.
1632240	1632880	What game are you?
1633600	1638720	I'm sure it's regrettable within 16 hours. I, they, they, I almost got fired. I mean,
1638720	1643200	if I had gotten fired, Rick and Morty would have been over. I, it was like, we went from yay,
1643200	1647520	70 episodes to like, I had to spend three months wondering whether there was ever going to be a
1647520	1655440	show again. Because in 2009, I humped a doll in a, in a, in a video that, that, that somebody
1655440	1661200	called a number at Turner because they associated it with a blog entry. They saw about someone else
1661200	1667840	anonymously. And I was being investigated for fucking child sex trafficking, like because AT&T
1667840	1673600	didn't want to take any chances. Like I, like we have to, this isn't, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
1673600	1680240	personalizing this or if I did, it would sound a lot like that, but I'm saying I, I'm having
1680240	1686640	this experience and I'm not accidentally saying anything. I accidentally humped a doll in 2009,
1686640	1691280	probably not a great idea. Doesn't seem too funny these days. But like,
1692960	1697920	like, like, like, like, like the, the parallel universe that almost got created because I did
1697920	1704480	that 10 years ago is pretty extreme stuff. And it's not the Nazis that, that, that, that,
1704480	1710560	Nazis have a right within our country to operate within the dark bowels for no money and try to
1710560	1715440	make people mad and racist at each other. Like they, they're pretty underfunded and pretty hard
1715920	1720960	they don't show up to a lot of meetings after a while. Like they, they, they, they left to their
1720960	1727520	own devices. They are not the threat. I believe that when their antagonism meets is, is, is,
1727520	1734320	it has its hand shaken by timid, cowardly, weird, reactive, scary insurance companies and
1734320	1738640	corporations. That's when we're in trouble. Somebody's got to, somebody's got to like,
1738640	1744800	like realize that this new world means a new policy is necessary for, and that all of us
1744800	1750080	like Andy Warhol's wrong now. Like we're all not going to be famous for 15 minutes. We're all in
1750080	1756160	constant rotation going to get fucking crop dusted with viral parasites. Like we're all going to,
1756160	1762640	every once in a while, find ourselves in the midst of a crazy and tropic, weird social phenomenon.
1762640	1768160	And corporations owe it to us to not base whether they, we show up to work the following morning on
1768160	1777040	that. I, I will, the only thing I want to say about that is now, assuming that, assuming that,
1777040	1780720	forget it for a second, whether or not that guy is more or less racist than any weather man.
1781760	1786000	I was in a town to say again. Okay. Sorry. Sorry. The guy was saying something. I don't know. He's
1786000	1789120	doing his weather report and he must've been, he was trying to say Martin Luther King Jr.
1789120	1792640	or there was an event that was going to be at Martin Luther King Jr. Park. And I think he said
1792640	1797200	something like Martin Luther Kuhn King Jr. or something like that. He stumbled and it sounded
1797200	1802800	like the word Kuhn in the midst of a civil rights leader that was, yeah, it's really not
1802800	1809040	ideal. And, and it went, and they didn't, they didn't catch it or do anything about it at the
1809040	1815120	time. And it went viral and then he got fired. And last couple of days I've been seeing in the,
1815120	1819920	within the news cycle, he's that, he's that lower left kind of story where he can tell you, oh,
1819920	1824960	Al Roker says he believes this guy or whatever. It's just kind of, it's as ridiculous as it should
1824960	1830240	be the situation when we're talking about something so silly. And, and I, I, the only
1830240	1833360	thing that I wanted to say about it, because I'm sure everyone's capable of having their own
1833360	1839680	conversation about it. I'm not going to add anything to it except this, assuming he is no
1839680	1843200	more or less racist than, than, than any other weather man, assuming that you can tell whether
1843200	1848880	he is or isn't, uh, by, by, by sound eruptions that come out of his mouth. I, I only asked this
1848880	1854560	question. This is not a political or philosophical stance I'm taking. I just thought of this and it
1854640	1859440	was like, you know, I, I think I might be right about this. I want to check.
1862720	1866400	Isn't weather man the only job you could do capably while racist?
1869120	1873280	Like if you gave me the ability to eliminate racism from any field
1875200	1880880	and it had like 10 charges in it, I would get to food service way before I tried,
1880880	1884960	I tried running in my list. I was like carpentry. No, no, I don't want a racist making my chairs.
1886320	1891520	I just feel like it's probably like the one thing you could do without hurting anybody and be totally
1891520	1896320	racist. But hey, who is that guy with the swastika on his face in the cafeteria? He's not touching
1896320	1903120	my food. Is he? No, he's the weather man. Okay. He can't control the weather, can he? No, no,
1903120	1909840	that would be then, you know, like make sure let's police that field for racism. If you can make it
1909840	1913680	rain on certain neighborhoods. You're saying we're finding out that you're soft and racist
1913680	1919680	weatherman. I am, I am, I am either incredibly disrespectful towards meteorology
1923840	1929760	or I am biased about the idea that the first people that are getting fired are,
1929760	1935280	happen to be the people who have to talk into microphones every day for, it's like, okay,
1935280	1942640	come on. Like, like it, that is the, it would be kind of fun. Like if, if like channel five and
1942640	1948960	KTLA in Los Angeles had just racist weather man, like he really, he gave you the weather and he
1948960	1954080	was really good at it, but this is an experiment. Just to see if it, he slipped in some just
1954080	1958800	full on racism during, during it. Yeah, I don't know. You could try different things each week.
1958800	1963120	Here's our misogynist weather man. Like, oh, there's a cold front coming in. Not as cold
1963120	1971840	as women can be toward me. I deserve sex, but, but, but, but, but lower, so Cal deserves this
1971840	1978640	cold front coming in and we'll be back with sports with our Scientologists. Let's see what hurts.
1979200	1984080	Just, just for fun. And this is a comedy, but do racist weather man. I just, I just did enough.
1984080	2001520	Uh, frenemy. Do, do a weather man who hates Turks. Why? To what end? For comedy and for memes
2001520	2007920	and for you to get fired. My, my quote unquote joke was, isn't weather man the one occupation
2007920	2013040	that you could be, could do without, while being racist. I did not get the laugh I expected. Uh,
2013760	2019680	the, the, the, I was just working out new material. The, uh, the, the, the laugh I was,
2019680	2023360	I was, I thought I might get would be like a creeping one where everyone thought about it.
2023360	2030160	Like I had it when like, yeah, actually, actually, if you ranked every job in the entire planet,
2030960	2035760	like, like, like where, and you had to put your most racist person on your island community. If
2035760	2042400	you had to put him in one place, weather man seems like the safest place. And that's if the
2042400	2050240	guy's racist, but is he a great, is he a great weather man? Like, Oh, he's the best. Oh, thank
2050240	2055680	God. I didn't watch the clip. I'm sure he's just a guy that, that, that, that, I mean, well, now we
2055680	2059440	know he's a guy whose life is probably ruined. I, I'm sure there's a lot of people listening for
2059440	2063200	very good reasons. We're going boo hoo. Smallest violin playing for that guy. When blah, blah, blah,
2064160	2070960	so I'm not like, Oh my God, the world's going to go to hell because you fired a fucking, uh, uh,
2070960	2075520	white weather man. And like, I don't want to, I don't want to bat for that team. But I am,
2075520	2082000	I am, I am once again, as I, as I will continue to do, I am saying as a, as a, as a fellow left
2082880	2088720	leftist, like barbarian, like, man, we got to get our tribes together because the only people that
2088800	2094160	don't follow this, this fucking weirdly stringent book of rules are the people that are, they're
2094160	2098880	the most hateful in their hearts of all hearts. The people who actually want to tear us asunder
2098880	2107600	and trample us and remove us. Uh, they, they often, often know exactly which words not to say, uh,
2107600	2113600	case not in point, our president, but, uh, it's like, look at the passes you get if you bat for
2113600	2121760	the other team and like, can we just, boy, why, like, that's why I'm saying like corporations help
2121760	2126880	us out because people can't, if I retweet somebody saying something embarrassing on the news, it's
2126880	2132160	not, I, we can't legislate that. It's not my fault that that person gets fired. Like I don't,
2132160	2138400	even if I, even if I see it out of context and I'm like hashtag fire that fucker, I should be able to
2138400	2143840	do that. If you can buy a gun in our society and not, and not be a part of the problem, then you
2143840	2151840	should be able to lose yourself in a crazy viral uproar and, and adamantly say, fuck this racist
2151840	2158560	fucker. He should be stripped of all of his rights and paraded into the ocean on Twitter as a private
2158560	2164080	citizen. And then six hours later be like, Jesus Christ, he's a human being. What the fuck? I was
2164080	2169760	drunk and not find out that you were part of getting him fired. And the only way to change that
2169760	2176000	is if the actual fire or fire you're firing people, the dragons with the fucking fire breath,
2178240	2183920	they've got to change. And I don't know. So I don't know. I don't want to do. Okay. Our next segment
2184720	2190560	is called, uh, no, it's just racist weather man. Okay. A few more thoughts about that.
2190560	2200320	Uh, so God bless you, Polish mayor, uh, had a dam of which I can't remember Pavel,
2200320	2205920	Pavel, a dam of which I think that was his name. I think there was a British MP named Joe Cox or
2205920	2209760	someone who also got murdered in a similar situation where someone, one of her political
2209760	2214160	opponents was like, Oh yeah. So much killed this person or she, you know, she's, she's so dangerous
2214160	2217680	that someone should stop her or something. And then someone like shot her with an improvised
2217680	2224880	gun or something. And she died. It's no good bullies, man. Can't it's like, it's the thing.
2224880	2230240	It's like, we gotta, we gotta stand up against bullies. Like if the person that you're, uh,
2231280	2235840	challenging, hurting, whatever, like just run it through the litmus test of, am I doing anything
2235840	2242160	risky? Am I risking anything? And is this other person like so much more powerful than me that I,
2242160	2246240	I can't hurt them by, by doing this and like run it, run it through that test.
2246240	2253200	Like, because we need to all be united against the people that punch down. Um, and, and, and that
2253200	2260160	can actually hurt us because it's, it, it could get, it could get bad so fast. Like it, it, it,
2260160	2264560	these are our cousins abroad. These are the societies that are going through the same
2264560	2269120	shit for whatever creepy reason. I blame Facebook. Everyone's like, well, it is Facebook. This is an
2269120	2274560	issue and they're everyone's, everyone's in these right slants. So like, God, please let us, let us
2274560	2283280	emerge as the weirdly ironic, like, uh, sensible one in this thing and lead everyone to back to
2283280	2289280	regular ass gridlocked bureaucracy where I was so comfortable. I just want to die in peace.
2291040	2297440	I don't want to, I don't want to die screaming in fear. I don't want to die by racist. Yeah, man.
2297440	2300720	Actually that's better than colon cancer though, right? Like, I just,
2303520	2306800	maybe if I got, if you could pick your age, you could go like, well, when was I going to die of
2306800	2315840	colon cancer? 67. You get a bad colon. Uh, okay. Can you, can you, I'll pay you a million dollars
2315840	2320480	to make me colon cancer free until 67 and I will agree to be killed by racist.
2321280	2327200	Well, I mean, yeah, that sounds great. Like, yeah, especially if you could be in the, you could be
2327200	2331360	like, okay, so now I'm going to, since I'm going to get killed by racist, I'm going to, I'm going to
2331360	2337280	speak my mind at this rally and like, okay, send them up. Oh, and then like you, you, you set a price
2337280	2341920	that you're willing to pay and then other people can like try and outbid you for that death. Right.
2341920	2346720	Because your death won't go viral after a while. Right. It'll be like the new colon cancer is being
2346720	2355600	an upstanding person. We'll enter an arms race of being like profound people with integrity.
2358160	2370400	Irish elections. Yeah. Irish elections. It's a new segment about Irish elections.
2370400	2379280	Irish elections. I feel bad for the people that listen to this show and radio lab because they're
2379280	2384000	like, all he does is repeat everything from radio lab. Uh, apparently the Irish, let me know what
2384000	2388320	you think about this system, Jeff. All right. The Irish have this ranked voting system. Oh,
2388320	2392480	yeah. We use that in Maine. Yeah. We're starting to experiment with it in local communities.
2392480	2397600	Yeah. That will like a leftist like person or something won in, in America in a race because
2397600	2403360	we use that the last midterm. So this idea of not one person, one vote, but you, you, you, you
2403360	2409040	rank your top five choices in order from one to five. Now you're already going too complicated.
2409040	2412880	It'll never work. It has to be simple. You're allowed to just mark one person. Number one,
2412880	2417760	Bernie Sanders. You can, you can do the same thing you've been doing. Number two, Hillary Clinton.
2419680	2427520	The, uh, but in this version, like everyone goes one through five. So they count the number ones
2427680	2434240	first, and then they start eliminating from the bottom of the number ones. So everyone that had
2434240	2439840	a number, everyone who, uh, everyone who voted for Bernie Sanders, what is the bit? No, I'm,
2439840	2445920	I'm trying to help explain every, everyone who, uh, everyone who's number one candidate gets
2445920	2453440	eliminated in the beginning of the counting process. Their number two choice goes back into
2453520	2457280	the pool and starts getting counted as if it's another ballot. Right. So if you,
2457280	2462880	if you voted, so there's no like nadir complex thing there where people are blaming each other
2462880	2468160	and there's no disenfranchisement of voting because you're, you're, you're, you're conscious
2468160	2474480	conscience as a voter is being reflected as a kind of like more modern kind of hash array of,
2474480	2479840	of, of tastes and choices. It's like a bell curve of like, like, like, oh, like there was more
2480400	2485200	twos and three choices than there were number one. In the event of a huge division among people
2485200	2489920	of splintering, then what's going to come to the rise to the top is everyone's second or third
2489920	2497600	choice, which, which means that you can't, it de-incentivizes, uh, uh, the idea of shutting
2497600	2504160	people out. And which, which really is a, in my opinion, that's like a great cure for, for the
2504160	2511120	virus of fascism because it really, um, you can't run on the ticket of, come on, everyone
2511120	2515520	wants to say it, but no one's saying it. Even though 30% of us are the ones saying it, everyone
2515520	2520640	else is so fucked right now. If we all, 30% of us are getting real fucking loud and scary,
2521280	2525840	we'll outnumber everyone else because they're so splintered and arguing with each other.
2525840	2531520	That would never happen because not only do candidates need to consider how, uh,
2531520	2537840	how they're perceived by the people that won't vote for them because you want that edge of being
2537840	2542480	a people's second choice, at least, uh, it's going to change the behavior of campaigns and
2542480	2548960	candidates really fast. Only an idiot would be so rhetorically exclusive that they would be making
2548960	2553440	this huge gamble, an appropriate gamble. You would have to really believe in white nationalism,
2553440	2558240	for instance, if you really like refused to bend a little bit about it rhetorically during
2558240	2563520	your campaign, because you would be betting that if everyone made me their last fucking choice,
2563520	2567680	except for 30% of the people who made me their number one, I'll still win. Cause you know what?
2567680	2572800	No, there's no leadership here. That's a good, that's an appropriate proportionately, uh,
2572800	2578160	a gamble for you to make as a candidate. And it just, it just causes this, like,
2578160	2583360	it's like a nice little Nyquil on your election. So Ireland does this already in Maine is also
2583360	2587600	doing it. They're doing it for, I think Senate races or congressional races in Maine, but yeah,
2587600	2591840	Ireland everywhere. There was an election nerd on this radio lab who, who was saying like, you
2591840	2596320	know, the way the Irish look at the American electoral system is they look at it like an
2596320	2601600	IBM laptop from the nineties. Like you, you, you guys got your democracy in the 1700s and it was
2601600	2607120	like, it's, it's the symbol of, of, of how everything was going to end up being. And it's
2607120	2613360	the moat and it's the thing that everyone covets and, and, and it's, it's so powerful and so amazing,
2613360	2618480	but from back then and has, and is now in danger of becoming absolutely symbolic of
2618480	2623680	clunkiness and oppression and disenfranchisement. Like not, it's got viruses and bugs and worms
2623680	2628480	because, oh, it was so perfect and it's a state of the art that it's not changing as fast. Well,
2628480	2636640	the Irish, they got their democracy in the 1920s. So they were like, I don't know. Fuck like,
2636640	2643920	can't really fuck, fuck this up, right? Let's try some different shit. Sorry, Irish friends.
2643920	2651120	That was a horrible accent. Also the sentiment was awful too. But, but no, but they're,
2651120	2654560	they're lean and mean and they, they didn't, they didn't, they, they, they were like, okay,
2654560	2657680	let's, how do we do this? Right. And they came up with this kind of weird channel one-on-one
2657680	2662080	voting system where you like your, your ballot is five choices. The more I think about it,
2662080	2666240	the more, the more sense it actually makes. So the problem with our system, right? The
2666240	2670400	problem with our system is that it's counterintuitive because what you think you're doing
2670400	2674880	is voting for the person you want, but because of the election dynamics, you're actually just
2674880	2678960	voting against the person that you don't want. So you vote for Hillary Clinton because you don't
2678960	2683520	want Donald Trump to win, but a vote for Hillary Clinton doesn't make her win. It actually just
2683520	2687840	prevents Donald Trump from winning. So you're, you're only voting against your least preferred
2687840	2692400	candidate, but in ranked choice voted voting, you actually are voting for your favorite person.
2692400	2696800	And then your next favorite person, you're never voting against someone or you can,
2696800	2700480	you put them as the last rank. So you would put Donald Trump as like seven.
2700480	2705600	If there's a hundred people on an Island and 30 of them want Elizabeth Warren and 30 of them
2705600	2710560	want Hillary Clinton and 20 of them want Bernie Sanders, like Donald Trump shouldn't win. Right.
2710560	2715120	Exactly. We don't know who will win on the other side, but it's like, it should be a no-brainer,
2715120	2720320	but like this one person, one vote thing disenfranchisement, it creates nihilism. It
2720320	2723360	creates like this idea of like, why am I going to go to the polls? I'm not going to get counted
2723360	2728640	anyway. Holy shit. Everybody gets counted in like a really weird way. When you do this voting system,
2728640	2734320	like you're, you're, no matter how outside the fucking game you are, representative Lee,
2734320	2738400	like you, you're, you're, you're, you can watch this thing like a horse race and you're like,
2738400	2744160	that's mine. That's, that's because I picked her for third. Um, you're, you're, you're invested
2744160	2748480	the whole time. I think you feel represented. Uh, well, we're never, we're not going to change
2748480	2754560	anything. We're going to go down fucking, maybe not in flames. Maybe we'll go down like, uh,
2755600	2757760	just thinking of fun songs or something. I don't know.
2759760	2763360	That's weird. I said, we're going to go down, dot, dot, dot. And you were like, in flames?
2764880	2771200	No, I don't know. I was like, you're having trouble in flames. That's it.
2771200	2781360	How are we going to go down? Uh, I did like, I've talked too many politics, but, uh,
2781360	2789200	I did as an exercise today. I, uh, it was a weird, uh, I can't, I can't zoom in on these things.
2791200	2795920	Come on. What are you trying to zoom in on? On a screen grabs that I took. Cause I was like,
2795920	2802240	my experiment today was I was like, I'm feeling so satisfied right now. I'm like, not as phobic
2802240	2806160	Poland, not withstanding the world. I'm still scared about the world, but I'm, I'm feeling
2806160	2811360	comfortable right now. I'm reading the news on the toilet. Cause I, I, I, I, I, I like it when
2811360	2816720	Trump's in a bad mood. It's funny. And like, I, it makes me feel comfortable. I like an embattled,
2816720	2821360	like, like, uh, government who's like, you know, where everything's in gridlock and stuff. And
2821360	2826000	like, it makes me feel comfortable. And it makes me feel like maybe I'll live to see my sixties and
2826000	2831680	like, when things are like impossible to happen and the worst among us are so frustrated by that,
2831680	2835440	that our true colors come out and actually people judge them for it. So I'm in a good mood lately
2835440	2843440	about politics domestically, but it also then made me go, why are you such an elitist snob? Like,
2843440	2849360	like, what are you like? Like, like, now that you feel comfortable, why don't you think about,
2850320	2854720	uh, other people? It was like, like we're, we're learning a lot about narcissism and stuff from
2854720	2860000	like studying the president. And I'm seeing a lot of myself in him and like trying to use it as like
2860000	2864880	teachable moments where I'm like, you know, that's, that's a lot like me that the way he's reacting
2864880	2870160	to that or, or I'm better than that because of this. And like, maybe I can be even better than
2870160	2876400	that by not judging it. And I was like, I, I, I, I, I became determined today to find like
2876400	2885040	inspiring Donald Trump quotes. That's a, that's thirsty work. I was like, I was like, I was like,
2885040	2889440	now that there's not this like kind of rabid fear, this echo chamber, he kind of like,
2889440	2893200	he's the worst and I refuse to accept that he's not the worst. Like I, it was just enough that I
2893200	2897600	was like, what if I recreationally, what if I was like, I, I stepped into the shoes of a fan and
2897600	2902080	I'm like, I want to find him saying some cool stuff. What if my only modifier was the word very?
2903040	2907920	But I can't, I can't, I didn't, I didn't anticipate this. Oh, okay. I double click it.
2907920	2912800	That was a very funny joke by a very funny guy. I'm the very funniest.
2913920	2917680	So I literally Googled like Trump smart quotes.
2920080	2922320	Okay. No, no, I'm in.
2926320	2928320	If the word varies in there, I get a hundred dollars.
2928480	2932160	It was funny. The, the first thing that came up was like, like, there's a couple of funny things
2932160	2936720	out, but here's a quote. It is a real honor and privilege to endorse Mitt Romney. Mitt is tough.
2936720	2941280	He's smart. He's sharp. He's not going to allow bad things to continue to happen to this country.
2941280	2944160	We all love. That's the first, that's the first one at the top of the thing. I'm like,
2944160	2947440	that's not really very smart. He loves himself some Mitt Romney.
2947440	2952480	And then the second quote was, but I have to say probably when I'm about 30, I'll be pretty,
2952480	2956800	not settled, but happy with what I've accomplished so far. I'm happy where I am now.
2956880	2962560	That's an Amy smart quote. So I already, that's how few smart quotes Donald Trump has.
2963360	2968800	I Googled Trump smart quotes, got one quote from Trump about Mitt Romney that didn't involve
2968800	2973760	dyslexia. And then the second thing down was someone named smart saying something.
2978800	2983200	He's good fun though. But I did, I did find some stuff where I was like,
2984080	2988960	you know, do you want to play a game? It's like, I love games. You want to play a game called,
2990320	2999360	did I, did I save this quote because I thought it was dumb, gross, or reminded me too much of myself.
3000320	3001760	I think those are the three categories.
3008240	3012080	Dumb, gross, or, or too close to home for me.
3012080	3014560	Spencer and I, the audience get to guess on these or?
3014560	3019360	Well, let's not give the audience any power. Yeah. I like this. They'll just, they'll just,
3020320	3025120	not to the people. We don't want to tell them, Hey, so you either need to shout out dumb, gross,
3025120	3030320	or this long sentence. Like that's good. Even they're not going to like that. Dumb, gross, or
3031200	3035840	dumb, gross, or too close to home. Too close to home. Meaning, meaning I saved it. Cause I'm like,
3035840	3039920	you know what? Be honest, Harmon, this sounds like something you'd say. That's why you don't like.
3040160	3042000	Dumb, gross, or Harmon.
3042000	3043840	Yeah. Dumb, gross, or Harmon. Thank you. Okay.
3045360	3047200	Here's our new segment. Dumb, gross, or Harmon.
3052400	3054720	Wait, let's start. Can you start it over?
3061760	3064160	That seemed like it was just in the middle of the, can you start it?
3065120	3068000	That's definitely in the middle. You don't want me to succeed because
3069520	3073200	you get paid to make up songs on the road. So you're afraid, you're afraid.
3073920	3075920	They're going to hire Dan. They're going to scoop.
3075920	3078160	You're afraid Drew Carey is going to take me to Florida.
3083920	3088000	Dumb, gross, or Harmon. These are things our president said.
3088560	3090560	All right. That's enough.
3093520	3098640	So these are Donald Trump quotes and we have to judge whether they're dumb, gross, or Harmon.
3099360	3105360	Okay. Yeah. I don't make deals for the money. I've got enough. Much more than I'll ever need.
3105360	3107040	I do it to do it.
3107040	3108720	Harmon. Yeah. Harmon.
3109360	3111280	Now, gross. Darn.
3112880	3114480	Because I do things for the money.
3114480	3115360	You get to vote too?
3116000	3116400	What?
3116400	3117360	You get to vote as well?
3117360	3119120	Well, yeah, I'm going to tell you why I have the answer.
3121040	3122000	You don't get to decide.
3122000	3123280	Well, what if we outvote you?
3123280	3127520	It's your opinion. You can tell me your opinion, but it won't be my opinion.
3127520	3128480	Majority rules.
3128480	3130080	What if we all say that sounds like a Harmon?
3130080	3131920	Well, then you guys are assholes.
3132880	3135360	No, you guys can make your own decision.
3137440	3139760	By applause. Who votes dumb on that one?
3140800	3141600	Who votes gross?
3141600	3143040	This just wants to hurt you.
3143040	3143920	Who votes Harmon?
3145040	3147040	Okay. So that's a Harmon quote.
3148000	3149680	I don't think this is how the game works.
3151200	3152240	It is now.
3152240	3153120	That's fair.
3153120	3157680	Money was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score.
3157680	3160080	The real excitement is playing the game.
3160080	3160880	Gross.
3160880	3161520	Gross.
3161520	3162640	Yeah, I also thought that was gross.
3166720	3167840	Here's a quote.
3167840	3171840	I make money because I have to pay for everything apart from my school fees.
3171840	3174720	My mother even makes me pay my own telephone bill.
3174720	3175280	What?
3176160	3177600	That's a Davonna Trump quote.
3177600	3179680	That's a Davonna Trump quote.
3179680	3182000	Okay. From when?
3182960	3183520	The past?
3185280	3188720	As long as you're going to be thinking anyway, think big.
3191440	3192080	Dumb.
3192080	3192720	Dumb.
3192720	3192960	Dumb.
3194720	3197040	Without passion, you don't have energy.
3197040	3199040	Without energy, you have nothing.
3200480	3200960	Dumb.
3200960	3201200	Dumb.
3201280	3201760	Dumb.
3203360	3205440	A little more moderation would be good.
3205440	3208640	Of course, my life hasn't exactly been one of moderation.
3212640	3214800	Also, the Harmon category can also be kind of like,
3214800	3219600	I'm like, you know, if he only said this stuff, he might be my guy.
3222000	3223760	Because for better or for worse, I'd be like,
3223760	3224800	because it would be minus the...
3224800	3227680	Well, I'm not going to give you a key to solve the riddle, but...
3227680	3231920	This is one that I truly just don't understand,
3231920	3236160	and this one I just screen grabbed because it was like,
3236160	3237280	first of all, what the...
3239200	3242560	The first thing the secretary types is the boss?
3244480	3245280	Hell yeah.
3245280	3246080	That's fucking badass.
3246080	3247920	And I screen grabbed it because it's from this...
3247920	3249200	That's an alpha male.
3249200	3253840	It's from this website where you get quotes and they're like tag clouded.
3253840	3260560	The tags for this quote are boss, first, secretary, thing, types.
3262080	3262640	Fair.
3262640	3263040	Yeah.
3263040	3264560	Sometimes you're looking for a quote.
3264560	3267200	The first thing the secretary types is the boss?
3267200	3267920	What does that mean?
3267920	3271280	The boss said, give me a taco bowl.
3271280	3272480	Like the boss said...
3273200	3276160	So if I type you, I'm getting your taco bowl or what?
3277200	3279440	Secretary takes notes of what you're saying,
3279440	3282320	like by saying like, oh, the boss is saying this, maybe.
3282320	3284080	The boss, the boss, the boss, the boss, the boss.
3284080	3284800	He starts everything.
3284800	3285680	Oh, the boss?
3285680	3286080	Really?
3286080	3288320	The secretary is taking notes of the conversation.
3288320	3289520	The first thing the secretary takes is the...
3289520	3290400	Yeah, I don't know.
3290400	3291520	I'm going to go harmony with that one.
3291520	3292400	Oh, oh, oh, wait.
3292400	3299120	No, maybe what that means is like the first thing the secretary types
3299120	3302960	is the thing that decides the policy at the office or whatever.
3302960	3306960	It's the first thing that he dictates to he or she and says,
3306960	3308880	the boss wants this, the boss says that.
3308880	3311040	But isn't there kind of like behind every great boss?
3311840	3313520	Isn't that sort of like giving...
3313520	3316880	Isn't that sort of like hint hint the secretary is really running the show?
3316880	3317360	Or am I...
3318080	3319280	I don't know why you would say...
3319280	3320880	I get that interpretation, yeah.
3320880	3323840	It almost seems like it's just like badly improvised porn dialogue.
3323840	3324480	Oh, for sure.
3324480	3327120	Like, oh, she came in and she typed me, if you know what I mean.
3327120	3328400	I don't know what you mean.
3328400	3330960	There's nothing even remotely phallic about typing.
3332560	3333680	Like my dick's like a key.
3335680	3337280	Yeah, it's the kind of thing an idiot would say.
3338240	3341440	I have an attention span that's as long as it has to be.
3342880	3344080	I like that one, yeah.
3347280	3351120	One of the key problems today is that politics is such a disgrace.
3351120	3353040	Good people don't go into government.
3356560	3358640	Dumb and gross, but also I agree.
3360560	3363440	I'm the earnest Hemingway of 140 characters.
3364160	3367440	Harmon, Harmon!
3367440	3368080	That's a fucker.
3368080	3371280	I also saved that one, because this jokes in poor taste,
3371280	3373280	but the first thing I thought when I read that, it was like,
3373280	3375360	well, let's hope that metaphor follows through.
3378240	3378720	Hey-o.
3384720	3386000	Here's one that's interesting.
3386000	3387920	Some of these I just grabbed because I'm interesting.
3387920	3388640	Because I'm interesting.
3389360	3392400	Harmon, I'm like very, very interesting.
3392480	3393680	I'm like the most interesting.
3395600	3397840	Apparently, he said at one point, who knows when,
3397840	3401440	if I don't get along with Democrats, I'm sort of like out of business.
3402960	3403680	Where's that guy?
3406160	3407840	That sounds presidential.
3407840	3410080	That's neither dumb, gross, or Herman.
3410080	3410480	I know.
3410480	3412400	That sounds like a president, doesn't it?
3412400	3415920	It sounds like a grassroots, like working class, like actual.
3415920	3417280	It sounds like Calvin Coolidge.
3417760	3421600	Like Harry Truman desegregating the army.
3421600	3422240	Why?
3422240	3423360	Because he was so woke?
3423360	3424880	No, because it saves money.
3425920	3427040	All paths lead to Rome.
3427040	3430320	You know, like that grassroots fucking Midwest capitalist,
3430320	3434400	like let's stop hating each other because we can make more money.
3434400	3435360	Now you're making it gross.
3436160	3437760	Well, gross away.
3437760	3439680	I mean, that's part of Harmon and part of him.
3441680	3443920	I just spent today looking through these and was like,
3444000	3447280	what about the what about what about the him that might have existed
3447280	3449440	if someone hadn't like come to him and shown him
3449440	3452560	Cambridge Analytica figures that said like, you know,
3452560	3456880	if you wear a fucking figurative turquoise belt buckle out there
3456880	3462480	and start getting a little like fucking like, like a race baby,
3462480	3465200	like that's going to take you up 10% in this district,
3465200	3467440	like because obviously what we know about the guys that he says
3468000	3470080	he's all he wants is to be liked.
3470080	3473120	I mean, it wasn't I don't even I think he's as racist
3473120	3476560	as everybody his age, like, like, and probably like,
3476560	3480400	and that's that's that's really racist because race racism doesn't age.
3480400	3483760	Well, it doesn't even it's not even cool when it's freshly born,
3483760	3487680	but it's like, it really gets its ugliest right before you
3487680	3492720	shake your cane into the into the tomb and say la vie.
3492720	3495280	That's why we don't tend to listen to old people's opinions
3495280	3498240	about whether or not you should marry somebody or
3498240	3499760	or what you should do at your wedding.
3499840	3504080	And like, it's like, I think that the guy is just like,
3504080	3505840	he was a Democrat and then he was an independent
3505840	3506800	and then he was a Republican.
3506800	3509200	And he's just like, he's just like, oh, just want to win.
3509200	3511200	And like, somebody was like, you know, you should be racist.
3511200	3512160	And he's like, that's easy.
3514160	3515200	Just trying to be on his side.
3515200	3516240	That's his best I can do.
3518240	3520800	What my father gave me more than anything else
3520800	3523040	is great tutoring and a great brain.
3523040	3527600	Frankly, you know, my father's brother was a top person at MIT,
3527680	3531840	went to MIT, graduated from MIT, was a teacher at MIT,
3531840	3534560	a professor at MIT, a great engineer.
3534560	3537520	I mean, you know, I have very good genes.
3537520	3539280	That was his father's brother.
3539280	3539780	Yeah.
3540960	3542000	He just, yeah.
3542000	3543600	I'm going to go, I'm going to go harm another one.
3543600	3545920	No, just dumb, dumb, absolutely dumb.
3545920	3548240	Like what you just told me your uncle's smart
3548240	3549440	and that you have good genes.
3549440	3551600	Like you, you go to MIT.
3551600	3552560	He went to MIT.
3553360	3555360	Your genes didn't go to MIT.
3555360	3558160	The intellectual wattage of a half a saltine cracker.
3559840	3563280	That's dumb with a big whipped cream of gross on top
3563280	3565280	because underneath that he's revealing
3565280	3567760	that he truly thinks that where you get into school
3567760	3570640	is actually the, it's the ribbon that the pig gets
3570640	3571440	at the state fair.
3571440	3573600	It's like, it's a ribbon for genetics.
3574400	3577440	Really actually dangerously gross without even knowing it.
3579440	3582080	People assume I'm a boiler ready to explode,
3582160	3584240	but I actually have very low blood pressure,
3584240	3585600	which is shocking to people.
3586560	3587920	Wait, that's Steven Tyler.
3589680	3591280	Well, I was, I picked Alex.
3591280	3592960	I was like, actually, that's so me.
3593520	3595440	That sounds like an Aerosmith lyric sound.
3596400	3598320	That seems like something I'd be like bragging about.
3598320	3599920	Everybody thinks I throw tantrums.
3599920	3601360	You haven't seen me throw a tantrum.
3601360	3603680	You know, the crazy thing is I'm fucking too low key.
3603680	3604560	I'm too low key.
3604560	3605040	Read that one.
3605600	3606720	Read that one again for me.
3606720	3608000	That's like a rock and roll lyric.
3608000	3610560	People assume I'm a boiler ready to explode,
3610560	3612560	but I actually have very low blood pressure,
3612560	3614160	which is shocking to people.
3614160	3615200	ACDC.
3615200	3617360	I mean, that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a version of me
3617360	3618960	that I really don't like about myself.
3618960	3622320	I kind of, my, my, my version of that is like, uh, like,
3622320	3623600	I don't, I don't, I'm more.
3623600	3625760	But it's shocking to me because I actually,
3628400	3630560	it's, it's like the worst ACDC song.
3631760	3632880	I'm like a boiler.
3634640	3637200	People assume I'm a boiler
3637200	3639600	and I'm ready to explode, but I'm not.
3640560	3642000	I don't eat enough salt.
3644960	3647200	No, but I kind of, I, my pre-therapy self,
3647200	3649760	like really prides himself on like,
3649760	3651600	oh, I'm very comfortable.
3651600	3655840	Like I'm a very like, like I, I had to recognize through therapy
3655840	3659520	that a thing that I was doing to people that I like,
3660720	3664800	then I was like, if I perceive myself as being in a conflict with somebody
3664800	3667360	or if I perceive someone as a threat to me or something,
3667360	3670160	like, like I kind of like had this pride in the fact
3670160	3673200	that I, yeah, but I can withstand like,
3674240	3677200	I can, the only way I characterize it is like an airlock.
3677200	3681120	Like I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll step you over to where I know
3681120	3683520	there's like noxious gases like coming out
3683520	3686400	that are just like enough to make you turn green,
3686400	3688640	but I've breathed them my whole life.
3688640	3690400	Like I'm kind of like, what's wrong?
3690400	3692800	You look like you're uncomfortable, you know?
3692800	3695760	Like I was really proud of that, like, like for a while.
3695760	3697200	I thought that made me Wolverine.
3698160	3700000	And I don't like that guy anymore.
3700000	3702240	And that's, that's, I think that's really what's behind that.
3702240	3705680	He's like, yeah, he got, everybody thinks I'm like a big maniac,
3705680	3708400	but the truth is I'm fucking cool as a cucumber.
3708400	3709680	And that's my secret.
3709680	3711760	Like everybody else is like, let's get to him.
3711760	3714560	It's like, no, you're, everyone is letting you get to them.
3714560	3716240	You're cool as a cucumber because you're,
3716800	3718800	it's always a baby that's throwing its own shit.
3718800	3720880	Like you have, of course you're not upset about it.
3720880	3723760	Like you're already upset about your fucking pudding that you didn't get.
3727280	3729200	So many people are on television that don't know me
3729280	3730560	and they're like experts on me.
3730560	3732080	That's me, just bitching about.
3735520	3737200	I wouldn't mind a little bow.
3737200	3738560	In Japan, they bow.
3738560	3739200	I love it.
3739200	3740640	Only thing I love about Japan.
3743200	3743760	Harmon.
3743760	3744400	That's so mean.
3744400	3745680	That's the Harmon, that's the Harmon.
3746320	3747680	Like I would, and I would think like, man,
3747680	3749600	I can't wait for the Japanese to hear that podcast.
3749600	3752160	Because, because you don't like travel that much.
3752160	3753520	You don't like Paris.
3753520	3754800	You don't like Rome.
3754800	3755600	You don't like.
3755600	3755760	Yeah.
3755760	3757840	And I would think like, you know, I got that like,
3757840	3758880	that danceplaining thing.
3758880	3760240	I'm like, here's the thing about, like,
3760240	3761840	the Japanese will love this observation.
3761840	3762960	Like, I love the bowing.
3762960	3763920	It's the only thing I like.
3763920	3766160	You know, and then I would, I would be like, why are they mad?
3768080	3771360	Jimmy Carter used to walk off the airplane carrying his own luggage.
3771360	3772640	Do you remember that?
3772640	3774640	I don't want my president carrying,
3774640	3777200	I want the freaking Marines to be carrying his luggage
3777200	3779360	and they want to carry his luggage.
3779360	3779920	Harmon.
3779920	3780880	No, dumb and gross.
3780880	3781840	Dumb and gross.
3781840	3783280	No, no, that's you.
3783280	3786080	Like when you travel and you fly now, you hate the airline.
3786080	3787280	You keep calling the Marines.
3788000	3791200	I want to be treated like a human being.
3791200	3792240	That's dumb and gross.
3792240	3792720	What do you mean?
3792720	3796640	You like Jimmy Carter less because he carried his own luggage?
3796640	3797440	Dumb and gross.
3797440	3798160	Like, what do you mean?
3798160	3799040	That's fucking awesome.
3799040	3800880	If John Wayne carried his own luggage and was president,
3800880	3801760	you'd be sucking his dick.
3801760	3802240	Fuck you.
3803520	3806080	Like this idea that Jimmy Carter is a pariah because he like,
3806080	3806400	fuck it.
3806400	3810480	It's just like, I'm now learning from you
3810480	3811920	that he carried his own luggage.
3811920	3814080	Can I go back and vote for him when I'm 10?
3815440	3816560	Poor fucking guy.
3816560	3818240	All I knew about him is that he's a peanut farmer.
3818240	3820320	Everyone just decided to just rail on this guy.
3820320	3821600	I bet he was the best president ever.
3823920	3825440	Experience taught me a few things.
3825440	3827920	One is to listen to your gut no matter how good something
3827920	3828800	sounds on paper.
3828800	3830880	The second is that you're generally better off sticking
3830880	3831680	with what you know.
3832320	3834400	And the third is that sometimes your best investments
3834400	3835520	are the ones you don't make.
3836160	3836880	Dumb.
3836880	3837520	Yeah, dumb.
3839280	3840240	Like, what does that even mean?
3840240	3841280	And that's probably go straight.
3841280	3842800	That sounds like it's from a school or something.
3842800	3845040	He talks in circles.
3845680	3848560	It means that you bankrupted a million businesses.
3848560	3851200	I think I was born with the drive for success
3851200	3852640	because I have a certain gene.
3856000	3857520	Dumb, gross, and Harmon.
3857520	3858160	Nah, come on.
3859840	3860320	Racist.
3861920	3862720	I think, yeah.
3862720	3863680	Where do you put it?
3863680	3864480	No, so gross.
3864480	3866720	I said, like, that's fucking like you're a Nazi.
3866720	3867440	Like, what do you mean?
3867440	3868320	That's a fundamental.
3868320	3871040	Now, in his defense, like, the guy, yeah,
3871040	3872160	he's talking nonstop.
3872160	3873440	So who knows when he said that?
3873440	3874320	Yeah, exactly.
3874480	3875920	But his dad is in the KKK.
3875920	3878480	The people that like him because he represents the idea
3878480	3880800	that, oh, gone are the days when poise is
3880800	3882160	what makes the difference.
3882160	3885520	Certain demographic has come to connect
3885520	3889360	the dots of poise and diplomacy with the dots of elitism
3889360	3890960	and you're boxed out of the system
3890960	3892320	because you're a grody person.
3894320	3896720	You know, so you're never going to like,
3896720	3899280	he's like a fire hose of garbage and people are like,
3899280	3902480	oh, that means I don't have to be ashamed of myself.
3902560	3905200	Shame's a hell of a fucking thing to overcome.
3905200	3907120	Like, I bet it feels really good.
3907120	3907760	Must be nice.
3909040	3912400	Wish I could be a fucking idiot that all of a sudden wakes up
3912400	3913920	one day, reads a fucking article,
3913920	3915520	and decides they're proud of themselves.
3915520	3916320	Jesus Christ.
3916320	3917840	Where do I buy that fucking drug?
3925120	3927040	I mean, it's $26 a bottle.
3927600	3928080	Hell yeah.
3932080	3932880	This just brought you back.
3932880	3935120	But my doctor is awful.
3935120	3936800	This is over-prescribed regularly.
3937440	3941920	So is our friend here?
3941920	3942800	Jesse, are you here?
3942800	3943760	Oh, yeah.
3943760	3944240	All right.
3944240	3945280	Oh, Jesse.
3947600	3948800	Jesse Camp, everybody.
3948800	3949440	He's got a packet.
3949440	3949940	Uh-oh.
3951200	3952480	Here comes Barry and gifts.
3954000	3954800	Oh, yeah.
3955760	3957200	It's a baby George.
3962880	3963680	Yeah, there you go.
3966000	3966960	You want to pop that up?
3968320	3969360	The baby George.
3970640	3973120	It's bigger than the normal George Foreman grill.
3977600	3978880	We got a baby George.
3978880	3980800	It's the champion of rotisseries.
3982560	3983360	Thank you, Jesse.
3983360	3983840	Thanks.
3983920	3984960	Absolutely.
3984960	3986000	Jesse Camp, everybody.
3986720	3990160	Boy, you're quiet as a church mouse back there.
3990160	3991440	I don't know why we keep being surprised.
3991440	3992960	It's like, wait, you were here the whole time?
3992960	3993440	No, no.
3993440	3994480	I think he just showed up.
3994480	3994960	Oh, really?
3994960	3996880	No, no, no.
3996880	3999520	Like, no, yeah, that is true.
3999520	4001680	But I didn't want to come empty-handed.
4001680	4006000	And the baby George kind of came into my acquisition
4006000	4007440	through some funny means.
4007440	4008000	Yeah.
4008000	4011360	I was actually collecting a gambling debt for Jeff.
4011680	4015040	So Jeff sends people to collect his debts.
4015040	4016160	No, no, no.
4016160	4017760	Jeff takes a lot of bets.
4017760	4018400	Yeah.
4018400	4019760	He's big news, man.
4019760	4023680	When he's flying out of town for a whose line is it anyway gig,
4023680	4024720	that's code for yo.
4024720	4027440	He's taking care of some Gambino's in Jersey.
4030480	4031280	Yo, yeah.
4031280	4034800	And with NFL, as hot as it is right now, you know,
4034800	4035440	a lot of debt.
4035440	4037680	Jesse, do me a favor.
4037680	4038880	Fashion Corner.
4038960	4039920	Fashion Corner.
4039920	4040560	Yes.
4040560	4042400	Walk me through your outfit right now.
4042400	4042960	Let's talk about it.
4042960	4045200	First off, I do just want to say, Dan,
4045200	4051760	it's an honor to always get to see you and Jeff as well.
4051760	4058160	And of course, the game master Spencer.
4058160	4059440	Yo, there you go.
4059440	4060000	You got it.
4060000	4061440	I didn't even help you.
4061440	4062800	No, no, no, no.
4062800	4066320	But guys, that being said, I'll zip it in the Fashion Corner.
4066320	4067120	Yeah.
4067200	4070480	Walk us from you can start from top to bottom or bottom to top.
4070480	4075200	I know I want you to tell me the methodology of your outfit.
4075200	4075920	Oh, yes.
4077440	4079760	The methodology to it.
4079760	4082560	It's heavy on the ology.
4082560	4084080	Not so much on the other.
4084080	4086000	But I'll tell you what.
4086000	4088240	I start with cowboy boots.
4088240	4093360	I am a 10 and a half and the traips match the curtain.
4094320	4095680	You know what I mean?
4096320	4097440	Yeah.
4097440	4102720	If you're ever curious about someone's wiener schnitzel size,
4102720	4106560	all you have to do is look at what their shoe size is.
4106560	4108880	OK, Michael J. Fox, seven and a half.
4108880	4110560	We know what you're talking about.
4110560	4111040	Yeah.
4111680	4113520	I mean, Manute Bull.
4113520	4114000	Hello.
4114640	4116560	Well, as a person that's shorter than you
4116560	4119120	and has bigger feet than you, I beg to differ.
4119120	4120880	Oh, no, don't worry about it, Dan.
4120880	4121760	What's your shoe size?
4121760	4123280	Come on, hit him with the shoe size.
4123840	4125840	Hit me with your shoe size.
4125840	4127040	He's 11 and a half, baby.
4127040	4128880	I'm 11 and a half and my penis is...
4128880	4130160	No, no, no, don't worry.
4130160	4130800	11 and a half.
4132800	4134880	That just means it's going to grow later in life.
4136320	4137440	Like the baby doors.
4137440	4140400	Don't think that what you have now is your final penis size.
4140400	4140880	Oh, no.
4141920	4142160	That's right.
4142160	4145040	Everyone knows that the penis just grows older.
4145040	4150240	If you go to a nursing home, there are a lot of Long John Silver's in the place, you know?
4150240	4151280	I think you're mistaken.
4151280	4155120	Yeah, well, your balls start to hang down to your ankles.
4155120	4155680	Yeah.
4155680	4156640	That awaits all of us.
4156640	4160400	You need to buy a second pair of socks for the balls.
4160400	4165120	But yeah, I mean, you know, we're for, you know, your hands if they're made right.
4165120	4166880	Wait, so Dan, you have bigger feet than Jesse,
4166880	4169040	but he's bragging about a giant penis.
4169840	4172160	No, I wasn't at 10 and a half.
4172160	4175520	I'm a moderately average, upper average penis.
4175520	4176640	That's just average.
4176640	4178240	If you went by my shoe size.
4178240	4179360	Yeah, exactly.
4179360	4180640	Which is the way to go.
4180640	4181280	Definitely.
4181280	4185040	I mean, Jeff, you everyone know is a...
4185040	4189040	My dick is shaped exactly like an ampersand.
4189040	4190000	Or an ampersand.
4190640	4193040	That is one not in the vocab banks.
4194640	4196640	Spencer's is shaped like one of those Dungeons and Dragons.
4196640	4197120	The ampersands.
4197120	4198240	It's like a dragon.
4198240	4200320	Oh, he has a dragon head.
4200320	4201760	I gotta, I gotta say this.
4201760	4204480	All the ladies after a night with Spencer say,
4204480	4207440	damn, thank you for Spencer's gifts.
4207440	4208480	Oh, damn.
4209360	4210080	All of the ladies.
4210080	4211120	That was, yeah.
4211120	4212400	There were multiple.
4212400	4212560	Yeah.
4213520	4213760	All right.
4213760	4216080	So now, and not zero.
4216080	4217440	Let's talk about your trousers now.
4217440	4218000	What do you got?
4218000	4219920	You got some stretchy, stretchy types going on?
4219920	4220720	What's happening?
4220720	4221520	Oh, wow.
4221520	4224720	Well, it is rainy season here in LA.
4224720	4228720	And so you no need to delve under the car hood,
4228720	4231200	but I have three pairs of leggings.
4231200	4232640	Jaggings, if you will.
4232640	4234240	And then the armor.
4234800	4238240	These are a pair of Massimo supply company.
4239040	4242240	Yo, but they're women's jeans, I will admit.
4242240	4243600	But I'll tell you guys this.
4243600	4244960	I'm a very tall man.
4244960	4247840	So I always wear cowboy boots because then, you know,
4247840	4250640	you can always doesn't matter if your pants are too short.
4250640	4252800	You know, that's that's your secret.
4252800	4256000	And like Stevie Nicks, I wear my boots all summer long.
4256000	4257920	Now, is there a fanny pack happening?
4257920	4258400	What do you got?
4258400	4260480	No fanny pack tonight.
4260480	4262720	By the way, guys, to be honest,
4263920	4266160	the reason I was a little late tonight is
4266160	4268960	because I went to the Szechuan fax machine theater.
4269600	4270240	What?
4270240	4272160	This is the Dynasty typewriter.
4272960	4275760	Yeah, across town, there's a Szechuan fax machine.
4276400	4277440	Okay, crickets.
4277440	4279520	Yeah, he's trying.
4279520	4281680	He's trying stuff out.
4281680	4284080	Guys, just trying some stuff out.
4284080	4284640	Yeah.
4284640	4286560	You're wearing four layers of pants.
4286560	4289840	Four layers of pants and then a pair of boxer briefs.
4289840	4291120	Just one t-shirt.
4293040	4293360	One.
4294320	4296000	Well, this is an interesting garment.
4296640	4298080	That's what I want to know about.
4298080	4300960	That's somewhere between bathrobe, dashiki, and cape.
4300960	4301600	It defies.
4302480	4303680	Bathrobe.
4303680	4305680	It is a bathrobe, but dashiki.
4305680	4307920	This was until I cut it down the middle.
4307920	4310720	To be honest with you, a lot of times what I do,
4310720	4313760	if there's a dress with a really cool fabric,
4313760	4315440	I'll just, you know, cut it down the middle
4315440	4319280	because a dress is just really a trench coat with a seam up it.
4319280	4319680	You know?
4320640	4320880	Yeah.
4321920	4324880	I mean, that's the truth, you know?
4325520	4328880	Lid blown off of dresses and trench coats.
4328880	4330400	Happy to blow off that lid.
4330400	4332720	That's one thing I am happy to blow.
4332720	4334400	And also my piccolo.
4334400	4338640	But, yo, not just one cut down the middle, dashiki.
4338640	4341680	One dashiki, two dashiki.
4342400	4344240	There's no three dashiki, four.
4344240	4346160	But then, you know, just a good flannel.
4346720	4354080	So I have something to keep my important cards, papers, and rolling papers.
4354080	4355840	But then on top, you have what can only...
4355840	4356880	No, I'm just kidding.
4356880	4358960	This is a EpiPen marker.
4358960	4359680	EpiPen.
4360320	4360960	Yes.
4360960	4362720	You're terrified of bee stings.
4362720	4363600	Bee stings.
4363600	4367680	I got bad peanut allergies and then I'm addicted to eating them.
4367680	4368560	Whoa.
4368560	4369520	That's an expensive habit.
4369520	4370560	And speaking of...
4370560	4372320	Hold on, but guys, I didn't want to...
4372320	4374880	Look, if there's one thing I got to just put out there,
4374880	4378560	I'm here because I've loved Jeff forever.
4378560	4379920	Dan is the coolest.
4379920	4381680	And I'm a huge Harmon Town fan.
4381760	4387920	And so I did just want to say that something I heard Dan say tonight about Jimmy Carter,
4387920	4389840	that was really, really dope.
4389840	4392080	I mean, if we're going to think about presidents and stuff,
4392080	4398240	Jimmy Carter has built literally over like three, 400 houses for Habitat for Humanity
4398240	4400720	with his wife since leaving office.
4400720	4406880	I mean, he's a guy that will go to Katrina and build a house just with other volunteers.
4406880	4407680	He's been doing that.
4408240	4412240	And I mean, I definitely didn't mean to get political,
4412240	4415280	but his vibes that he sent out were peace and love and good.
4415280	4418400	And yeah, and then, who knows?
4418400	4422640	And supposedly, they ranked IQs of presidents,
4422640	4427440	and then Jimmy Carter is probably our most intelligent president we've ever had.
4427440	4428240	Yeah.
4428240	4429280	That doesn't surprise me.
4430480	4432880	I grew up in the Midwest, so all I remember from that time,
4432880	4435280	I was like eight, nine, 10 years old, something around there.
4435360	4439600	And I just remember this like hysteria for Reagan.
4439600	4445600	And yeah, I was socially conditioned to like,
4446160	4448880	oh, Jimmy Carter is such a fuzz nut.
4450480	4452400	It was like, I don't even know what a president is,
4452400	4454160	but I know I hate Jimmy Carter.
4454160	4454720	And he sucks.
4454720	4455760	He's such a terrible president.
4455760	4456400	I'm like, what?
4456960	4459280	I'm just fascinated by that because I'm like, what did he...
4460960	4462160	It seems like such a quiet...
4462880	4464560	No one typically doesn't talk about it.
4464560	4465680	And I have a sneaking suspicion
4465680	4467440	that's because there is nothing to talk about
4467440	4470160	because he did a really good job, I was assuming.
4470160	4474160	And because he was so progressive that they destabilized him.
4474160	4479040	They say like the whole hostage crisis thing,
4479040	4483200	it was set up for him to fail so that he would not get reelected
4483200	4484640	and that he'd be a one-term president.
4484640	4486160	There was an oil crisis back then.
4486160	4489360	I'm really going to show my ass if I start talking about this stuff
4489360	4491440	because I don't know, but I have a feeling,
4491440	4493680	I have a weird feeling that there was an oil crisis
4493680	4494880	because OPEC was forming.
4494880	4497040	And it was like the idea was that,
4497040	4498560	oh, we had a little crossroads there.
4498560	4500720	It was like we could have committed to our rhetoric
4500720	4502400	about wanting democracy and all this stuff,
4502400	4504480	but then you get a little tough choice there
4504480	4506480	where the people that are sitting on top of the things
4506480	4508720	that you want start to get votes and stuff.
4508720	4510080	And they're going to vote for people that you don't like.
4510080	4512400	And I have a feeling that there was probably a...
4512400	4514400	That he probably exists in some kind of weird
4514400	4516080	back-to-the-future maelstrom where,
4516080	4519920	oh, either Biff starts washing your car or has a museum.
4519920	4521840	I think he's done more after his presidency
4521840	4523840	than most presidents did during their presidency.
4523840	4524320	Yeah.
4524320	4527200	Because he's a humanitarian and he's an intellect.
4527200	4530560	And weren't those the days when people
4530560	4533040	that could actually complete a sentence
4533040	4535760	and be thoughtful and care about each other?
4536320	4536720	Yeah.
4536720	4537200	Yeah.
4537200	4540480	I mean, I'll tell you this really quick thing.
4541520	4543200	Like about maybe like 15 years ago,
4543200	4546960	I was on a road trip just kind of driving randomly through Georgia.
4548400	4550320	And I ended up in Plains, Georgia,
4550320	4553840	which is literally the town in Georgia where he grew up
4553840	4556320	and still lives to this day.
4556320	4558720	And there's maybe like 20 people in the town.
4558720	4562880	It's dirt poor, but it's still where he never stopped living there.
4562880	4563600	He grew up there.
4563600	4565840	I mean, this is the one thing I want to say to that.
4566560	4568080	I don't think that as a country,
4568080	4570080	we should ever elect a president
4570080	4572400	who has never been poor a day in their life.
4572400	4575040	Because that's going to be, I'm sorry to say,
4575040	4577360	but someone that's going to lack empathy.
4577360	4581920	And I mean, I think, yeah, I mean, just, you know.
4582880	4586000	I don't know anybody cool, like my circle of friends,
4586000	4591840	all the people that I look up to and respect and think highly of
4591840	4595360	are people that know the value of what it means to have $1.
4595920	4597200	Well, how about an easier choice, though?
4597200	4598720	Just say that the title of president
4598720	4601200	shouldn't be a thing that's like a reward or anything.
4601200	4604320	It used to be a shit like a clerk job.
4604320	4606000	In Ireland, this I learned from my ex-wife
4606080	4608160	when she was just here for Harmon Quest.
4609120	4611280	She was explaining that they have this thing that I,
4611280	4613360	you know, I've been saying since the Trump election,
4613360	4615280	when you look at like what people like about him
4615280	4617440	and what people, like the only conflict is like,
4617440	4620160	you could solve this in the blink of an eye by going,
4620160	4622160	okay, if we're going to keep insisting
4622160	4625440	that the title of president basically means American King,
4625440	4627520	then make it a title worth that.
4628320	4630960	In other words, just let him, like he said himself,
4630960	4633200	all he wants to do is run around and say,
4633280	4636080	hallelujah, like love it, like Louisiana,
4636080	4638560	peace out and have everybody like with the hats and the things.
4639120	4641680	Ireland has a president that does that.
4641680	4642400	That's all they do.
4642400	4644240	They elect the most Irish guy in Ireland
4644240	4645360	and they call him president.
4645360	4647040	And then they have like, I don't know what his title is.
4647040	4649600	I don't know if it's prime minister or something else,
4649600	4650720	but it's like, it's function.
4650720	4651520	It's just like, yeah.
4651520	4653360	And then there's this person that rolls up their sleeves
4653360	4655920	and probably went to law school and like runs a fucking country,
4655920	4659600	like in cooperation with the bureaucracy that you need
4659600	4661520	if you're going to have hundreds of millions of people,
4661760	4667280	like under you that you need their lives
4667280	4669040	to not fall under the whims of things.
4669040	4671920	Like I, yeah.
4671920	4675520	So definitely, and also someone that could actually
4675520	4678000	build an all inclusive society,
4680000	4684080	where the goal is for everyone to prosper and do well.
4684080	4686160	And I mean, in order for that to happen,
4686160	4687600	you can't have someone who's corrupt.
4687600	4688960	It should be a thankless job.
4689040	4692720	You should like dread being any kind of politician
4692720	4695600	because your life should be under a microscope
4695600	4696720	every minute of every day.
4696720	4699040	Everything you say should be checked and double checked.
4699040	4705200	And it should be a job that attracts fetishists for organization.
4706960	4708560	Fetishes for organization.
4708560	4710960	Yeah, people who, there are people in the world
4710960	4713760	who tend in our society to become accountants
4713760	4715920	and certain kinds of lawyers and things,
4715920	4719040	civil rights lawyers and people that,
4719040	4720320	those should be our politicians,
4720320	4721360	the people who would be like,
4721360	4722880	yeah, no, that's not a job for me.
4722880	4723760	The reason they're saying that
4723760	4726000	is because it's a disgraceful occupation
4726000	4728880	for narcissists and blowhards.
4728880	4731840	And they don't want people to look at how they smoked pot
4731840	4733680	in college and like call or, you know,
4733680	4736640	look their search histories up for debate
4736640	4738320	or if they ever had an affair and stuff.
4738320	4739680	Could we just strip that stuff out
4739680	4742160	and make it a graceless occupation?
4742160	4744400	And now they're all trying to do Instagram stories too,
4744480	4747840	like Beto O'Rourke's like trying to live tweet from the dentist
4747840	4750000	so that, yo, he can be relatable to us.
4752000	4753040	Yeah, it's like great.
4753040	4754400	You have dental health care.
4754400	4755280	Go beta.
4755280	4759280	I mean, like, yo, good thing your last name ain't Max.
4760000	4760560	Hell yeah.
4761360	4763200	The old video format.
4763200	4765200	Yes, yes, yes, yes.
4765200	4768240	But listen, getting back to the matter at hand.
4768240	4769920	Oh yeah, we got to keep this thing on rails.
4769920	4772240	Oh no, but I mean, let's get back to business.
4772240	4774000	Jimmy Carter is still alive.
4774080	4777120	And if mental and physical health are linked and, you know,
4777120	4780560	I believe we all know they are and have a good energy in you.
4780560	4783680	I mean, Jimmy Carter, he's alive way past 90.
4783680	4785360	He's the real Clint Eastwood.
4785360	4786320	You know what I mean?
4786320	4787920	Would you be willing to share, Jesse?
4788720	4789360	Just say no.
4789360	4790480	I think I asked you this last week,
4790480	4791520	but I was kind of in a blackout.
4791520	4793040	I was like, hey, next time you come back,
4793040	4795520	would you be okay talking about the fact that recently,
4795520	4796960	like you were kind of off the grid for a little bit?
4796960	4797200	Sure.
4797200	4797840	Stuff like that.
4797840	4798720	Yeah, absolutely.
4798720	4802400	A lot of kids listen and like they go up and down and stuff.
4802400	4803440	Oh, absolutely.
4803440	4804720	You've been struggling with stuff.
4804720	4808240	And like, are you on the wagon now?
4808240	4809200	You want to talk about that stuff?
4809200	4809680	Like, where are you?
4809680	4810960	Oh, by sobriety?
4810960	4811600	Yeah.
4811600	4812240	Oh, I mean.
4812880	4815120	Like what you've done, where you've plummeted,
4815120	4816560	what you're back from, where you are.
4816560	4817840	It's okay if where you are now.
4817840	4818160	Oh boy.
4818160	4819200	Okay.
4819200	4821440	Like, also just say, no, I don't want to talk about that.
4821440	4824160	I want to have fun and not do that.
4824160	4825600	You'll, but if you...
4825600	4827120	No, no, no, absolutely.
4827120	4831760	I mean, there's definitely, you know, some lows and some highs.
4831840	4834560	I mean, talking about politicians for a brief moment,
4834560	4836400	they're a crazy bunch these days.
4836400	4840000	I am someone who I can say has slept with not only Camilla Harris,
4840000	4843040	but also Lindsey Graham. Bingo.
4843040	4844560	There's some freaks in the Senate.
4845200	4846240	Yeah, that's what I was talking about.
4846240	4846640	Yeah.
4846640	4846880	Yeah.
4848160	4849280	Yes.
4849280	4849840	But no, but.
4851440	4854960	But Lindsey, but Lindsey, Lindsey, Lindsey, Lindsey, Lindsey, Lindsey, Lindsey, Lindsey,
4855840	4862240	But listen, I want to say that, that no, no, Dan, for my heart, honestly, like,
4863120	4867280	life, that's what makes life, life is that, you know, you have amazing highs
4867280	4872800	and then the rest is like lessons in humility and, you know, both are great and necessary.
4872800	4878400	And so, no, and, and first off, one other thing, just as a human being,
4879040	4884000	you, I mean, Harmontown, the movie is such a courageous movie.
4884000	4887680	And you, if anything, have always, I mean, just just from the bottom of the heart.
4887680	4892240	And why I just want to say that you being such a courageous person and just,
4892240	4895360	you know, letting everything out there so people can learn from it.
4895360	4896560	It's such a beautiful thing.
4897600	4899520	I'd be honored, you know, to.
4899520	4901200	It's not really a selfless act.
4901200	4902320	Like, I appreciate it.
4902320	4913040	I'm like, I'm alive because I found out that I can, I can say what is on my mind
4913040	4918560	and like, I'll live longer than if I, than if I bottle it up.
4918560	4921280	And that's why I just, because you were, you were missing for a little bit.
4921280	4924400	Like, like, Jeff, you didn't you find him?
4924400	4927600	I mean, it's like, like, you were withdrawn and you were.
4927600	4929680	And Jesse, like, tell me, like, if you don't want to talk about it,
4929680	4933600	but like, like your sister called me up and said, yeah, you went off the grid.
4934240	4937120	And she said, like, where's Jesse and text him?
4937120	4938880	And I did, but you didn't have your phone.
4938880	4942240	And then one day I got a fucking awesome text from you and you're like,
4942240	4945440	hey, man, and you were just cracking jokes and you were back.
4946000	4946560	Yes.
4946560	4949360	And what's the story?
4949360	4950240	Oh, yeah.
4950240	4953280	The story about can we tell the story about you draw a lot of value from that.
4953280	4956080	If you've been to dark places, you don't want to talk about it.
4956080	4957520	It takes you back to a dark place to talk about it.
4957840	4960720	No, no, no, no, no, no, not at all.
4960720	4961440	I'm guys.
4961440	4963840	Honestly, we were fucking worried about you.
4963840	4968000	And and we we put the bat signal out and says, where's Jesse?
4968000	4968320	Yes.
4968320	4973200	And then you told me when you texted me, I called you and you said, it's like finding
4973200	4977600	out what it would be like to die because I find out how much people would care about me.
4978400	4984400	And like, like, and you go, oh, like, like, these are the people that would care if I died.
4984400	4987120	And don't mistake that as advice for the youth or anything like,
4987120	4988640	hey, you know what, you should try.
4988640	4989600	But but nobody.
4989600	4993600	But you found out that like there are people because I think of you, Jesse,
4993600	4997920	as somebody and my joke is always that you would give me the seven shirts off your back.
5000080	5002320	But you're that kind of friend.
5002320	5004960	You would you would you would do anything for a friend.
5005520	5009760	And then you found out who your friends were when when you went off the off the air.
5009760	5012480	As far as I understand, like, it's pretty obvious from your personality.
5012480	5014080	Sorry, I know we're explaining you to you.
5014240	5019920	But but like, I like I think it's the thing that draws me to like the reason I want to hear about
5021120	5024240	any any any things that you've battled just because of this, because
5025920	5027280	you're a really nice guy.
5027280	5033360	And I don't know you that well, but I I feel like it's like seawater where like,
5033360	5036880	you know, from a drop, like what the content of an ocean is
5036880	5039040	and that you're not a judgmental person.
5039040	5041920	You don't you don't put a lot of energy out towards like
5042880	5046400	worrying about other people and how they should be in order for you to be happy.
5046400	5050240	No, that's important for people to learn that there's a I mean, or to or to deal with the fact
5050240	5056720	that like people like like like if that hurts lately, like I feel like there's too many people
5056720	5058720	in our society that like are like that.
5058720	5061360	Like, look, I don't want to judge other people and all this stuff.
5061360	5064320	And it's like that comes with a lot of self loathing, a lot of self torture,
5064320	5067840	like directing a lot of energy inward, where you're like, I'm a piece of shit.
5067840	5070080	So I'm just going to like medicate and like vanish.
5070080	5071680	And yeah, I'm sick of this.
5071680	5076880	So anyways, that's why I'm like, that's why I think it could be so valuable to talk about.
5076880	5078960	Because absolutely I am.
5078960	5083120	So in order to I'll tell you I'll tell you guys the whole story in order to put it
5083680	5085040	properly in perspective.
5087840	5095200	Oh, but I don't in any way in any way want to throw my sister under the bus either because she
5095840	5099760	she is a fantastic person with her own demons too.
5099760	5110080	But so basically, from like about 2015 through like the end of 2016,
5110080	5114000	I've been working with my sister on on a new series.
5114000	5115600	And it had been going amazing.
5115600	5120240	I mean, we had, you know, and we still all you know, it's still all there.
5120240	5123680	And it can and we're still working on on putting it together.
5123680	5132800	But we basically, I had worked really hard on this project with my sister and for, you know,
5132800	5140320	for some reasons and and to be really blunt, I was really kind of like on the on the verge of
5140320	5145040	making a comeback that had been like 15 years in the making.
5145040	5151200	And but this is this what I'm trying to get to is that, you know, like my sister and I kind of had
5151280	5157440	a falling out over some some crazy stuff, or she really went into a dark patch.
5157440	5161680	And then, you know, we couldn't see the the show to fruition for a moment.
5161680	5163520	And I kind of just fell into a depression.
5163520	5171520	And I had been sober for about and when I say sober, I just mean like no hard substances,
5171520	5175200	you know, and I don't consider marijuana.
5175200	5180080	And I don't consider, you know, like alcohol, you know, to to really be a drug.
5180080	5186400	But at the same time, you know, anything that you abuse and and, you know, anything that's
5187200	5191360	basically just numbing you in your pain without allowing you to grow at all.
5191360	5193440	I mean, that's that's an addiction and that's a drug.
5193440	5196320	And so what I'm getting into is that I did kind of like fall into
5198480	5205360	year and a half drug addiction with a drug that I hadn't touched in over like seven and a half
5205440	5214800	years, because I was just, you know, the fallout from well, just things with my sister, you know,
5214800	5218640	and then everything, you know, yeah, I just kind of fell into depression.
5218640	5228640	But where I'm going with all of that is so then I basically so I was using some heavy drugs for
5228640	5233680	like almost a year and a half. And then I ended up kind of just, you know, in Fontana, California,
5233680	5240480	as one does, you know, nothing, nothing good happens in Fontana, by the way.
5243360	5249520	Twenty four hour auto zone. You need headphones to live there, right?
5249520	5252320	The only time I've been to Fontana, I had headphones on the entire time.
5252320	5258240	Oh, well, get this. If you want your car fixed, relatively dirt cheap.
5258240	5262960	All you got to do is and wait until it's about 10 because the freaks come out at night.
5262960	5269920	But you go to the 24 hour auto zone in Fontana after 10. And basically there are tons of people
5269920	5276000	really high on supplements in the parking lot, either working on their own car or just hoping
5276000	5280320	that someone might need work done on their car. So like when you call me, you said I'm telling you
5280320	5286320	get four of these after hour auto zone, like, you know, mechanics in the parking lot like together
5286320	5293280	and you'll have a new engine in a car in like two hours for like a hundred bucks and maybe a bag
5293280	5299200	of Flamin' Hot Cheetos, you know. So I'm telling you when you call me, you're at a pick apart in
5299200	5304560	Fontana, right? Oh, that was way after that was that is a couple of years into things. I mean,
5304560	5310560	so this is where the story gets good, is that I think that and again, I don't in any way mean to
5310560	5318160	slag my sister and I and I, you know, she just use your I statements. That's what I've learned.
5318160	5322880	If she's a part of the story, but you can still say, look, I was I was hurt. I felt I felt bad or
5322880	5328240	whatever. You don't have to worry about slagging her. That's great. What exactly. I mean, well,
5328240	5334720	during during my time of depression, you know, I didn't have much, you know, of a relationship,
5334720	5338960	you know, with my sister much either. And she was kind of in her own dark place, too. And so
5338960	5342720	I think, you know, that's why I really kind of become despondent. And
5344080	5350480	because, you know, you know, this was my creative partner, my best friend and my sister. And so,
5350480	5354800	you know, I really missed her so much. And we were really on the verge of some really
5355520	5363520	cool things. And so I mean, like, so what I was going to say is this, is that
5364480	5370080	wow, I know that this does sound like not many brain cells are in here, but I'm really trying
5370080	5373920	to just it sounds like it's important when people are listening and they've been through way worse,
5373920	5379040	believe me, as far as quality of show, like they're they're they're listening and they're
5379040	5385440	well, then you can take your time. I just, you know, met this Anita Baker impersonator named Tito.
5385440	5391120	And that's a whole other chapter for another pad cast. But I'll tell you this,
5391680	5400160	that, oh, Jeff, by the way, Tony, what's your friend, the friend that works at the carwash
5400160	5406320	with the obnoxious mustache that puts a turtle wax in it? Oh, no. This is how Jeff finds out.
5406320	5415040	No, no, we're going back. We're going back. But I hope we have a friend. He loves that. We do.
5415120	5421120	I would love to have a friend with his name is Tommy Tango. And he says hello. I'm no Tommy T.
5421840	5426640	I don't. But thank you. Yo, the mustache. But guys getting getting. Oh, wow. You see,
5426640	5432960	that's myself. I see that's a defense mechanism. Yeah. Jesse, I'm going to get into the real heavy
5432960	5437760	stuff. So you can also you can also pull up and out and we'll touch back on it another day.
5437760	5444320	OK, but but but I think I think like we're almost right at the end. And so, you know,
5444320	5448640	just two more seconds, guys. Yeah. We'll be over the waterfall and in our own. We're doing it.
5450480	5457120	Do you like you tell us as much as you want? Because first of all, I'm happy you're back.
5457120	5461760	Yeah. Because I was worried about you. And also America is happy. I'm back.
5462480	5470800	Yeah, man. But US. Thank you. But as definitely didn't have to coax that one, as as as Dan said,
5471440	5477440	and quite rightly, the like to the extent that you are willing to share what you went through,
5477440	5482160	I think is helpful to people that listen to our show. So like, like, like, like,
5482160	5488800	like, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. I'd really, you know, without sounding corny about
5488800	5494000	this, I mean, like just to put it in real like, you know, black and white cliff note terms,
5494000	5499760	you know, I'd been working with my sister who I still love and adore. And we made this insane
5499760	5505680	project where, you know, we have and of course, the Jeff Davis appearance, but everything from,
5505680	5512320	you know, Miley Cyrus to George Clinton to Alice Cooper, lots of really cool interviews and crazy
5512320	5518640	sketches and, you know, me at Charlotte Hornets games and, you know, and in West Virginia,
5518640	5523280	Appalachia, it's like just a whole crazy show project that would make it. And then
5523280	5528080	we had this big fallout. And so, you know, I just equate it like to like, if you were a part of a
5528080	5533120	band, you guys had been through like this journey and we're about to like, you know, finally release
5533120	5538240	your record, the band, you know, breaks up and the record is shelved. That's just a head state. And
5538240	5542720	but you know what, the more I'm talking about this, I just want to say, you know, like, fuck
5542720	5547520	me, because I mean, these are really quality problems to have, you know what I mean? But at
5547520	5553680	the same time, it's not so much about the project. It's about just losing, you know, my sister who,
5553680	5558480	you know, you guys just, you know, it's like my right arm, you know, what's your status with her
5558480	5565360	right now? No, we we we don't really talk at all, you know, and she was freaked out, man, because
5565440	5573280	she's like, I barely know her. And she she was sexy. This is the when I was in Fontana,
5573280	5582160	I had actually left my phone in a car of a of a dude. And then I didn't really exactly know how
5582160	5587600	to get it back. And kind of was just, you know, again, in a depressed state. So I kind of like
5587600	5592960	was like, you know, all right, I'm gonna enjoy not having a phone. And this was only about like nine
5593040	5599600	days. And then, but it was honestly, it felt kind of cool, like to not have a phone. And I was just
5599600	5605920	really sorting through, you know, my problems. And, and so I also kind of during that time without
5605920	5612560	the phone, I made a decision mentally to be like, okay, I'm stopping, doing the drugs that I was
5612560	5621280	doing completely. And, you know, because at the end of the day, you know, I was doing that to
5623120	5628000	get myself through a hurdle, I was doing like an upper type of drug. And what I'm getting at is,
5629200	5635200	you know, if you all of a sudden, you know, you find yourself alone, but you'd made all this,
5635200	5638800	you know, great progress, and you didn't want to lose everything, but you were just really confused
5638800	5644400	how to move on without your band, you know, my thinking is, well, let me do this drug that will
5644400	5649280	like, you know, kind of like help focus me and numb, you know, my sadness over what happened,
5649280	5657040	because it was a really, you know, like emotional thing. And, you know, you first turned to a project
5657040	5666560	oriented narcotic. Yes, yes. Yes, exactly. Exactly. That makes a lot of sense. I got that. That's that's
5666560	5673680	an interesting, like explanation of that. Like, yes, definitely. Because is the project the thing
5673680	5679600	that like when I when you invited me to the whiskey to meet LA guns? Yeah. So you still have
5679600	5683760	all that footage? Oh, it's all there. Yeah, it's gonna be I just I'm learning how to how to
5684720	5690800	edit it now. I got I got like, like, years of content backstage to a rock show with Jesse camp.
5690800	5697440	And guess what? Everybody is happy that Jesse's there. And he has all this awesome footage of him
5697440	5702720	and his sister interviewing people and just talking backstage. And yeah, that is something
5702720	5709040	that I would absolutely need to see. Oh, yeah, it's amazing. Is it still excellent? Like, it'll
5709040	5713920	happen still? Oh, absolutely. And I mean, it's it's a really cool project. It's kind of like,
5713920	5720640	you know, like Mike judge, Mike judges tales from the tour bus, you know, in that you have crazy
5720640	5727600	rock stuff interweaving with just basically like, you know, fun travel segments, like, you know,
5727600	5732640	go into weird flea markets in like Knoxville, Tennessee, and helping out in the wig department
5732640	5740960	there with, you know, senior ladies, watching, watching famous rockers meet you, like, because
5740960	5746640	I've seen that. Yeah. And it's, it's pretty magical. Like, like, that's something that should happen
5746640	5752640	because like, like, to know you is to love you. And to know there's also like, to know that like,
5752640	5758960	you would like always make things happy and fun. So like, you have to finish this thing. Well,
5758960	5764400	let me Oh, yeah, yeah. And, and just super, just super quick, you guys, what I wanted to say is
5764400	5770080	that basically, like during those. So this is the funny part about me. This is the part of the story
5770080	5776720	where I find out that I was a missing person because I had no idea. Okay, because like, I guess,
5776720	5783440	you know, like my so like I had emailed Oh, get this. Okay, because I'm very, I am very close with
5783440	5789840	my mom. So just about your nine days gone. Nine days gone. You're gone. And you're like, you know,
5789840	5795760	three days a good thing. And yeah, nine days gone to paint the picture. Nine. Now, so I'm in
5795760	5801920	Fontana. Are you editing? Are you like, are you like working on a laptop on? Oh, they're like,
5801920	5808000	and you're like, No, okay. You're living life just like you're just focused. Yeah, you're
5808000	5813040	experiencing focus. When we talk about the fashion, and I'm not bragging out of school here. But Jeff
5813040	5819200	knows this too. Like I'm a big I'm a, I'd have to cross diagnose myself with another addiction. And
5819200	5824640	that's I'm a I'm a thrift store junkie. And like, you know, you're wearing a jacket right now that
5824640	5831520	can only be described as like, any get your gun meets me. Wild Bill Hickok. Yeah, with a little
5831520	5837920	Nell in there. I thought Jodie Foster, I mean, who wouldn't want to be the costume designer on
5837920	5846400	Nell. It's just like bedsheets. Okay, the thread. John John Jodie. Yes, yes. Yes. Oh, great story
5846400	5852240	here. Great shout out. And here's another thing if if if I want, I really want to put my services
5852240	5859680	out there. If you guys, because when I was here, right before Christmas, you guys had Pete Holmes
5859680	5867120	on that was that was epic, brilliant show. I do I love one other talent is I think of myself as a
5867120	5872480	mini booker. And I'm not talking about Richard Greco's character on the last season of 21 Jump
5872480	5882720	Street, whose name is Booker. Okay. A lot of a lot of a reference for two people. Yeah. Oh, Miss Miss
5882720	5890240	read the crowd there. Okay. But no, I mean, you guys are more of a Gilmore Girls kind of bunch.
5890240	5896560	And that's cool with me. Do you guys know that Dan gets starred as mailman Jerry on two unaired
5896560	5904640	episodes of Gilmore Girls? Very, very cool stuff. You know, it's only shown in Japan for reasons.
5905360	5911600	Dan knows a little about and and and so does Lauren Graham. Do you want to talk about? Hey,
5911600	5918800	no, let me let me let me know back on track. Back on track. Is this is it so so I am 60.
5918800	5924240	Basically, it's nine days after I had lost my phone and said just fuck it, you know, in the end,
5924240	5930720	and then like three days sober from that. But then so I was three days sober. I started to get a bit
5930720	5939840	of a sinus infection. And so I went to a hospital. Yeah, I shouldn't say, but it's very close to
5939840	5946960	Fontana and has its own hospital and two good wills and a savers. And it starts with the R and its own
5946960	5954880	county. Okay. Riverside. I was in Riverside. I go into the hospital and like you had been missing
5954880	5961360	for months as far as I knew. No, no. Oh, we should we should suffix this. So basically, my sister
5961360	5966160	had only briefly talked with my mom that I admit that she hadn't heard from me. My mom and I do
5966160	5972480	talk on the reg. And so then I think my sister did. I think her imagination, but maybe genuine
5972480	5978960	concern, maybe maybe some guilt, maybe whatever. She was she was really worried that because she
5978960	5983760	knew I was depressed. I mean, like she did know that. And so I mean, I think that she maybe
5983760	5991680	genuinely was worried that I maybe did something rash because I was so broken up about, you know,
5991680	5997920	like, you know, just, it's a really rough situation, you know, people that want to hurt you,
5997920	6004400	like, like, no business in your, your relationship, but people that want to hurt you and have the
6004400	6011440	choice between soliciting, finding you. It's one thing to say, I come from a big line of like,
6011440	6015920	well, let's be dramatic about so and so's problem and like want to help them because actually what
6015920	6020960	we're doing is we're weaponizing our like concern because they're here every Christmas and let's
6020960	6029280	fuck with them. But it's another thing for you to be off the I don't not knowing your sister, I can
6029280	6036800	safely say I don't think it was her animosity that provoked her to explain to people how dire it was
6036800	6043360	that you were she was very she texted me and let me know let me know that she was really worried. I
6043360	6047920	think I think if you I think if you wanted to hurt somebody in there and they're off the grid,
6047920	6052960	whether it's nine days or three months, like you're it's not the part of you that hates them that
6052960	6058400	makes you go. This is really serious. I even if it's not really serious from your point of view,
6058400	6062480	it's not the part of them that hates you that makes them go to that high note. That's the part
6062480	6067200	of them that wants you found because maybe even if it feels a little bit of responsibility. And
6067200	6073440	I think that's very salvageable as much as this project, too, and easily salvageable. And
6074320	6081760	and like what if not to like conduct your fucking no story, but like the feeling of that rope coming
6081760	6086640	back out of that, like, like, yeah, do you have like, you didn't know you were missing? And then
6086640	6095920	and then and then absolutely. So so I'm in this hospital and you know, I think I gave my,
6096960	6104800	you know, a variation on my name. I don't remember. I was not. Oh, man. I love a good emergency room.
6104800	6112320	And so I was in one and basically like, you know, they were the you know what?
6112880	6118480	Screw that. This hospital was really a beautiful place. There's a hospital. I don't know. They
6118480	6124800	had they had one. They asked one thing of you. Don't name our county. Right. Right. Two Goodwills
6124800	6130080	and a great emergency room. And you're like, Riverside. And now every you got rumbled in
6130080	6136480	there because you said the other name, but they go. But you're Jesse. Yes. Yes, exactly. So basically
6136480	6142960	I told the nurse that my name was, you know, maybe John Camp. I don't even know. Not again,
6142960	6146880	just for, you know, like just because you know what I mean? He wants to give your real info and
6146880	6151760	social security number to the hospital. You told them your actual name, but they're like,
6151760	6157520	but aren't you right? Right. Right. Right. Right. So I said probably that because my full, you know,
6157520	6163840	my full name is Tito Camp. And so basically said Tito Camp. And then they're like, OK, Tito. But
6163840	6168880	like the nurse looked at me like she kind of like knew who I was, which was really weird because I
6168880	6176880	was, you know, yeah, a little disheveled, perhaps, or then again, I don't look much different than
6176880	6184160	now. I'm very much a kindred spirit with a drunk Gary Busey. But where I was going with this is
6184160	6190640	that. So basically then the nurse is like, OK, all right. You know, Josh, I think I said I was Josh
6190640	6196080	because that's that's very close to my my full name, which is Chad would have been believable.
6196080	6201120	Yeah. I look like Chad. So much like a Chad. A Chadwick is also what they call
6202240	6207120	the part of a candle that you like called Chad. Say on target. So
6210160	6214720	basically then I'm sitting to the nurses like, OK, Josh, you know, and then the
6214720	6220080	then and then the doctor comes in and he's like, Jesse, what's going on? And I'm like,
6220080	6224720	what the fuck? How did he know Jesse? I've been telling people I was Josh. And so I said,
6224720	6229920	oh, Jesse. But then I knew the Jig was up. They knew who I was. And so I was just like,
6229920	6235280	like trying to put the pieces together. Like I know that I'm a national treasure. I know that
6235280	6242560	the U.S. has made several, not just one stamp with my face on it, but like 10 different,
6242640	6250240	you know, stamps biannually with my head on it. It's great. The new 34 stent Jesse camp stamp is
6250240	6256800	Jesse camp stamp for all you tramps. OK, enough rhyming. I have a camp stamp over my butt.
6256800	6264560	Jeff does have a camp stamp from the time he he was with my mom and I didn't understand the
6264560	6269280	relationship at the time. Now I do. It was a very beautiful Harold and then Maude type of deal. Back
6270000	6278800	on track. OK, so to the doctor was like, you know, like just, you know, like, OK, just so again,
6278800	6285120	I had said that my name was Josh to the nurse and then the nurse was like, Josh, OK, Josh,
6285120	6290560	why don't you come back here with me? And then she came in. Josh, the doctor will see you now.
6290560	6295760	Oh, OK, cool. Hey, I'm Josh. I'm getting a bit of a sinus infection. You know, I just need some
6295760	6300800	antibiotics. I didn't rush to that part yet. Never self diagnose yourself at the doctor's
6300800	6304400	office. That is a sure way to not get the prescription you're trying to get filled.
6304400	6309440	You know, like, don't go in there and be like, oh, you know, like, let them assess your back
6309440	6314720	pain. Just look real grimacing in the face so they really believe you're in pain. Don't oversell it.
6314720	6320080	OK, that's to my homes in New Hampshire and West Virginia. You know who you are at the pill mill.
6320080	6327680	But back on track. I'm just kidding. Who am I to throw stones? What I'm really getting at is that,
6327680	6334880	yo, I'm like lost in Fontana F in California and up at a hospital in Riverside. Basically,
6334880	6343600	the doctor had like seen something about me being missing on TMZ. I had no clue in the nine days
6343600	6350320	since I had lost my phone that somehow, like I had been reported on like, you know, I'm like
6350320	6359920	people dot com. You know, does the dick me meet the expectations of the size website? You know,
6359920	6363760	dick it or stick it. I mean, no, what am I talking about? I'm sorry, guys.
6363760	6368960	They get a stick. It is something I think we can make some money. Dicker is sticker. I think
6368960	6373200	it's definitely like, you know, your doctor trying to swipe left or right. Your doctor
6373760	6377200	at the E.R. had seen you on TMZ. They had seen me. And so they were so
6377200	6383600	actually really, really super cool. They brought me like two meals of hospital food. I didn't ask.
6383600	6388640	They were just like they were like super cool. Like they were like basically like they owned a
6388640	6394320	sports bar and Kid Rock came in there. They're like, you know, they're dope. They're just like,
6394320	6401200	you want some delight ins? And I was just like, no, you know, all right, sure. What's the street
6401200	6407920	value? Yes, I'll take it. But they were really, really cool and really sweet and really encouraging.
6407920	6414720	And they said, you know, honestly, something along the lines of, you know, that that, you know,
6415360	6422560	you have a good soul and you're a good kid. Not kid, because I am definitely now like I'm in
6422560	6428800	the halftime show, but, you know, I'm I'm 39 years old. So 40 is the halftime. And then,
6428800	6435040	you know what I mean? If life is a football game or a Super Bowl, but back at the matter at hand.
6435040	6441680	And again, I'll totally be honest, that's a self defense mechanism to kind of like, you know,
6441680	6447440	to try to put some humor on this because because these guys, it is rough talking about this as
6447440	6454480	necessary. But these these were beyond humbling times, growing times and times when, you know,
6455600	6461680	yeah, you just you are all of this in the end is good because, you know,
6462560	6466640	but in that moment where you were you irritated, it's okay if the answer is yes,
6466640	6472400	because at the time it was like, like, well, you know, I'm here by choice and I don't want to be
6472400	6476800	rescued. And it's embarrassing that people like I can imagine that would be very humiliating.
6477520	6482000	And maybe, you know, when you when you find out you're a missing person, when you were just,
6482000	6489440	you know, at the, you know, end of a year and a half drug odyssey and that ends in, again,
6489440	6495840	Fontana. It's right off the 10, by the way. Fontana is that beautiful hamlet between
6495840	6502720	Ontario and San Bernardino. Okay. So if you want to go to Fontana, take the 10 freeway.
6502800	6511200	Fawn about it. It's a lot heavier on the font as in dude. Fondue is of chocolate and cheese and
6511200	6517600	fondude is like. And it has some I know that. Okay. Final thought we have to wrap up here,
6517600	6522400	though, is the whole thing. We have to wrap up. I know. And I will like a fucking condom about to
6522400	6525840	go into Heidi flights. I don't know your story for you, but we're looking for that moment of
6525840	6530240	like the crossing and return threshold where you're like, absolutely. Okay. I'm coming back.
6530240	6535040	Absolutely. Absolutely. I got that moment for you and more. Jesse, I'm going to pull a
6535040	6539840	Stefan. Jesse redemption is in Lower East Side, New York bar where there are lots of midgets that
6539840	6545920	wear fanny packs. Jesse, I have to say that the day that you called me up and you had been gone
6545920	6552000	for a while and you called me up, I you couldn't I got to say, yeah, that the feeling that hit me,
6552000	6556000	I think I know where you're getting at, Jeff, is that when the doctors, they they really showed a
6556000	6562320	lot of love. And and and that's I had no idea that I was missing when I had checked out of the
6562320	6568560	planet or, you know, lost my phone. I definitely wasn't wasn't in the headspace of thinking that
6568560	6573200	there's a big world out there that that cares about you or that you're significant. You know,
6573200	6581440	and I mean, I definitely felt like the opposite broken. I felt, you know, almost to the point of
6581440	6586080	here's the thing is that if you have nothing to lose, there is a real freedom with that. I mean,
6586080	6589840	like, like Chris Christopher's and freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.
6589840	6593040	You probably thought you were doing yourself and other people a favor. Yeah. I mean,
6593040	6598800	I didn't care anymore. And I did. I felt more honest than you had been, you felt, but you felt
6598800	6604080	like, like, that's the riveting part of this. Like, I feel this way so much. And like, I want
6604080	6610160	to hear from people that have gone and come back. Yeah. So yeah, sorry. Sorry to interrupt. But no,
6610240	6616800	not at all. I mean, that's definitely a sign of, you know, of of of not being
6619680	6623520	no one. Let's just call it what it is. I mean, you're depressed if you're not if you lose your
6623520	6631200	phone and you don't want to like immediately go to an Apple store or AT&T or Sprint or whomever
6631200	6639680	you get your phone from. Again, if you want a good phone at a relatively cheaper price than even
6639680	6646800	offer up the 24 hour auto zone in Fontana has all your needs. Mobile mechanics, paying
6646800	6654000	mechanics to grind with transgender. They got mechanics to go as you felt that feeling when
6654000	6659760	you felt that very complicated layered feeling of I lost my phone and for the first time in my life,
6659760	6666240	I feel like actually maybe that's the way to go. I feel good. My life. Is there is there a return
6666240	6672320	threshold equivalent? I'm just a screenwriter from the SID field school. Like is there to paint
6672320	6679680	a picture to really be just just just blunt about where I was prior to this. Did you save a cat at
6679680	6686480	any point? That's a screenwriting joke. OK, continue. No, I mean, no, no, no, no. It didn't
6686480	6694080	even get a laugh. So not worth it. Well, I'll add to that. You know, I I'd like to think I didn't
6694080	6699120	save a cat. No, you shouldn't have. You shouldn't have. And that's not story structure. That's a
6699120	6706960	different thing. It's a dialectic about. OK, go ahead. Not bad. But but here's the thing. And
6706960	6713200	believe me, man, like Bruce, do not even I don't even mean to even remotely think that I'm like
6714080	6721040	on the level of like a beautiful soul like Bruce Springsteen. But to be really honest,
6721120	6726480	I was just so broken that I was kind of wandering the streets of Fontana kind of like Bruce
6726480	6732240	Springsteen in the streets of Philadelphia video, you know, where I believe, you know,
6732240	6738800	from the movie where Tom Hanks has AIDS and he knows he's not going to survive that. And then
6738800	6745200	you you know, you're just pulling back from life in a way. I mean, I was just at a point where I
6745200	6751680	was almost I don't I don't mean I was just at my threshold of what I could endure. But the thing
6751680	6756800	is, is that having the strength to enter, I want to let everyone in this room know that like, you
6756800	6763760	know, I was just depressed, but never in a bazillion years would I ever no matter the level
6763760	6769440	of depression. And this is not also me passing judgment on people that that that check out and
6769440	6776240	can't take it. But I still know, even in my darkest hours, what a blessing it is to be alive.
6776240	6784880	And, you know, I'm very much, you know, of the opinion of if you've they say this about successful
6784880	6789360	people that when you realize something's not going right, you know, you can abandon it quickly. And
6789360	6794160	that, you know, the longer that if you're in a toxic relationship, you know, but you put a lot
6794160	6798320	of time in it, you're apt to stay in it longer because you've already invested this time. So you
6798320	6802400	don't want to lose the time you already have. And that's why bad relationships kind of go on and on
6802400	6807520	and on forever. And what if you feel that about your life? Well, I said, I said this for myself.
6807520	6816560	And I think for everybody, I love you. Yeah. And no, I know that. And I and it's, I didn't mean to
6816560	6821120	shut you off on that, Jeff. I know that. And but I mean, to hear that from you that that that that's
6821120	6829280	a heavy emotion. But I mean, that was it was it was what this it was a really this beyond a
6829280	6833520	life changing experience, because I mean, I'm not saying that I was like a guy who jumped off the
6833520	6839360	Golden Bridge Golden Gate Bridge and like survived. And now that's the danger to me. That's the thing
6839360	6844720	is that a lot of us associate like the idea of these thoughts with I was never ever going to put
6844720	6850800	a gun in your mouth, all this stuff. But like the these decisions can be made in the it. I know
6850800	6856000	exactly the feeling that you're talking about. Like, you know what? What if I was a fucking ghost?
6856000	6861040	What if I didn't exist? And that's different from saying, I'm going to take proactive action to do
6861040	6866080	this dramatic thing because you're feeling the opposite of dramatic feeling worthless. You're
6866080	6876880	feeling like like just like it feels in those moments like not just liberation, but like a weird
6876880	6883600	medicinal kind of like, yeah, this is it. This is what I need. This feels good. Totally. It's I'm
6883600	6888560	not going to say no, it's not good. But I'm also going to say it's incredibly dangerous because
6888560	6897040	you're alone. And so yeah, it was there. Was there a I mean, yeah, well, yeah. Or have you been
6897040	6903760	dragged back and we're going to lose you again to that. Never. No, no, no, this. No, to be really
6903760	6909360	blunt about that. And that and the other thing too, is that I'm not I'm not any anything coming out
6909360	6914000	of my mouth. I'm not trying to to pat myself on the back. But I mean, like there's definitely,
6914000	6924800	you know, the fun love inside of me. But I mean, I'm you know, I'm experienced as far as like that
6924800	6928400	you could you know what? No, I'm not even going to say what I was going to say. But I could
6928400	6933120	definitely just say that, you know, like if I'm walking the streets in Fontana, you know, I mean,
6933120	6942320	like I love to to bring I live like to put positive energy out there into the world. That's
6942320	6949920	that's my that that's really the only reason to live life where I'm going with this all is that
6952160	6956960	this is really heavy. But I promise I didn't take you guys this far to abandon it. But what I the
6956960	6961360	point I was trying to get at when I brought up that whole thing about successful people and then
6961360	6966320	knowing how to quit early. But like that, that really, if you're following your heart and you've
6966320	6971680	invested so much time in a bad relationship, you know, you want to hang in there. Well, I mean,
6973280	6978720	I'm very much like that in life. You know, I didn't put in these 39 years to not, you know, now
6978720	6984640	I've been in it that I'm definitely wanting to see it all the way till 80, maybe 90. Or, you know,
6984640	6992320	with, yeah, head transplants, maybe 110. You know, who knows? But where I'm really going with all
6992320	6998000	this is that it was it for two things. And then I promise I'll wrap this up. But it was really,
6998480	7005760	I think that what our subconscious is, our subconscious do for us is sometimes incredibly
7005760	7013520	protective, because I thought that I think in a lot of ways that I don't this is going to sound
7013520	7020880	crazy. But you know, like, I wanted to lose that phone. And I wanted to go off the grid, because I
7020880	7027200	ultimately wanted to get to that place. I wanted to make a low for myself and make that low as fast
7027760	7034080	as I could, because I wanted to land and I didn't want to live the way that I had been living. And
7035440	7044320	I just didn't, you know, and, and, and I didn't, I, I didn't want to numb the pain. That's basically
7044320	7049200	all I did for like a year and a half was just numb this emotional pain, didn't grow from it,
7049200	7056000	my body was just in subconscious and mind was just, you know, telling me to let go because one
7056080	7063520	thing I completely do believe in, is that I think, and obviously, if you were at 9 11, and you were
7063520	7068160	with all that the debris that was so cancerous, you're going to get cancer. But I do sorry,
7068160	7074560	sorry, that's a probably weird time to break that to you. Oh, yeah. But that anger is a cancer. And so
7074560	7080320	I really think that long story short, that I needed to kind of like, you know, go off the grid. But my
7080320	7085360	thinking was just that I was going to do this, I was going to then you know, get a couple days sober,
7085360	7090160	and then just continue on my journey was almost like wanting to get clean and like a cocoon.
7090720	7099200	And so I just, and I came out and and I had no idea what I told Jeff is true that that that
7099200	7104080	basically you would go on like, you know, Instagram, and you'd see like, you know, like people would
7104080	7109760	be like, Oh, Nikki six was, you know, looking for you. And you know, when President Barack Obama
7109760	7114400	was looking for you, you know what I mean? And Rex Tillerson was looking for you. What's the
7114400	7120400	connection there? And I'm just like, I don't know. I mean, like, Rexie was always a big fan,
7120400	7125920	you know, I mean, it was just like he would be like, Yo, Jess, get on the big Exxon Valdez cruise
7125920	7133840	boat thing and let's party. Rex Tillerson was looking for you. Oh, man. Oh, look, I'm it's a
7133840	7137680	hacky part of me that's like pushing his weird return threshold thing. I think the incredibly
7137680	7142320	valuable thing is the resonance of like everybody, whether or not they drop off the grid and go to
7142320	7148080	Fontana, lose their phone or not. We constantly are combating this feeling of like, I'm a fucking
7148080	7153280	ghost. I would be better focused and doing a better job. All of a sudden, it's like, it is possible
7153280	7159120	to kill yourself with everyone's permission because you'd never checked with them because
7159120	7166400	you didn't talk about it. You can you can slip away into shadow and you don't perceive it as shadow.
7166400	7170400	I'm not and I know that the whole time you're like, Look, I never intended to do any of this.
7170400	7176560	And I am not telling you, No, you perceived it wrong. I'm I'm saying the reason that story is so
7176560	7183920	valuable is because I think everybody listening is constantly going like, well, what if I what if
7183920	7188240	I what if I what if I and it's not always what if I did something dangerous? What if I did something
7188240	7193760	I think it's it's sort of just sort of like, like, like, would anyone miss me? Like, like, like,
7193760	7199120	shouldn't I just shouldn't I just be by myself? And there's a really fine line between that,
7199120	7206720	like, self help and, like, the opposite. Yeah. And here's the thing is that I mean,
7208240	7216080	I think what it really boils completely down to in the soul and the spirit of us of people is that
7216080	7223280	is having hope. Hope is everything. If you have hope, hope will fuel positivity. I mean,
7223280	7229280	one big lesson I learned from all of this is that mental health is the most important thing we have.
7229280	7236240	And that, like your physical health, like you do have to exercise and be conscious of what you're
7236240	7241760	eating. You know, mental health, I just always took it for granted before the last couple years. And
7241760	7249120	I realized that it's incredibly important to to to be social, to not self isolate and to be with all
7249120	7256640	your friends and to live a full life and and to say yes. And just but but more than that, I mean,
7258480	7265520	it's a battle out there and there's never been a harder time to be a human being. No, scratch that
7265520	7271520	statement. I can't believe I was about to say there was never a harder time to be a human than 2019.
7271520	7278960	What am I thinking caveman? And, you know, oh, my God, I'm going to get tripped up by a buffalo.
7278960	7283200	Jeez. Let's give it up everybody. Thank you for coming to Harman's house. Jesse Camp, everybody.
7283200	7289040	Thank you for being vulnerable, sharing your. But before I go out on the music, I want to say,
7289040	7295280	Jesse, I fucking love you. I'm a lucky man to have quality. And anybody listening,
7296240	7301840	if you ever get the lucky break to hang out with Jesse Camp, you are a fucking lucky human.
7301840	7309360	Well, a couple of things to plug, if I may. Yes. All right. I got a two here. Who here is a big
7309360	7316480	salt and pepper fan? Well, yo, get this. It's not a competing podcast, but I have a pepper cast.
7316480	7321360	That's right. Me and Peppa from Salt and Peppa. All right, Jesse Camp, everybody.
7321920	7323360	Yo, Peppa.
7325360	7335520	But for real, if you're a joy to know, you're a joy to be around. And I appreciate you so much
7335520	7341440	to the bottom of my boots, man. Thank you. Try it fast and take a chance. Thank you.
7351360	7365120	Did you get any of that? It's a good show.
