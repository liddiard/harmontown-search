0	19000	Oh my gosh, welcome to Meltdown Comics in the Nerd Mill Theatre.
19000	25000	It is my pleasure to announce that Harmon Town is once again in session.
26000	33000	Please welcome to the stage the Mayor of Harmon Town, my dear friend, Mr. Dan Harmon.
33000	52000	Harmon Town, I live in life in Harmon Town.
52000	58000	I got a bread basket on my left, did some apple sauce on the right.
59000	60000	Close enough.
60000	65000	I came up a different way, for those of you at home.
65000	71000	I went to a party tonight, so I'm a little drunk.
71000	76000	Stop it. Don't encourage it. You're 20m 40.
76000	79000	It's not charismatic for me.
79000	81000	It's inspirational for us, though.
81000	86000	Well, keep hitching your wagon to that star, my friend.
86000	89000	I will be 60, I'll be under a bridge.
89000	93000	You'll be 40, you'll have your own podcast, it'll make you nothing.
93000	100000	And we'll just keep, let's just convey our belt into a meat grinder, like in the Pink Floyd The Wall animation.
100000	104000	I saw you, Dan, right before you left to this party, and you were saying,
104000	115000	Jeff, we were at a bar, and Dan said, I'm not good with strangers.
115000	120000	You were worried about meeting your neighbor, and he Google-mapped where the party was,
120000	125000	and he found out that the house was the house right behind his backyard.
125000	126000	So how did it go?
126000	138000	Yeah, neighborly. But there was a point at the party where I found out that this lady who was hosting the party,
138000	144000	who were talking about wine and patios and cats, dogs.
144000	149000	I'm going to guess she was white.
149000	155000	That's on you, my friend, but you are correct.
155000	156000	Just a guess.
156000	163000	She let it drop, and not in the way that you're used to it getting dropped.
163000	172000	It got dropped that she had survived a tremendous brain tumor.
172000	176000	I'm too drunk to recall how organically it got scooted in.
176000	180000	She wasn't like, hey, that's my calling card.
180000	184000	She was cool with it. She had survived it.
184000	189000	She was part of her life, absolutely, so it accidentally arrived in the conversation.
189000	192000	Nothing could be more fascinating than you find that out.
192000	197000	Holy shit, tell me more. How does that start? What does it feel like? What's going on?
197000	202000	So I'm talking to a person who has had, she got on her iPhone,
202000	211000	she had iPhone photos of a golf ball-sized meatball that was in her head,
211000	216000	the center of it, like a cartoon, like a profile of her skull,
216000	219000	and then from the top, and then from the side,
219000	223000	you could see it right in the middle of her fucking brain, just a golf ball-sized...
223000	225000	What are you writing down?
225000	234000	Today's date.
234000	238000	Am I boring you?
238000	240000	This woman.
240000	243000	I had a couple drinks today.
243000	249000	I was at Greg Proops' comedy special at Musso & Frank's and there was gin to be had.
249000	251000	I'm happy to say...
251000	254000	There were tumor stories to be had at this party.
254000	261000	I wrote down today's date, I wrote down 7, 13, 13 question mark, is that right?
261000	266000	14? Okay, fuck all you people.
267000	269000	And I'm crossing out the question mark.
269000	274000	The only reason I wanted to tell this story is because of this curious social phenomenon.
274000	278000	I'm standing on a patio, the hostess has revealed...
278000	284000	I'm headlong into, you know, kind of deposing her about her experience
284000	287000	because this is something that I... unbelievable.
287000	291000	This happened to you, you survived it, tell me more, how did you find out?
291000	294000	There was another guy there, another neighbor,
294000	297000	I hope he doesn't start listening to the podcast tonight.
297000	300000	And this isn't on him, this is on me.
300000	306000	But it was like halfway through me kind of like getting more information from her
306000	313000	about this meatball that was in her head that she had survived, this God-struck lightning bolt.
313000	317000	She's walking around, she's hanging out, she's eating cheese with us,
317000	322000	but at one point Zeus had tried as hard as he could.
322000	331000	The guy goes, he said, I think this is verbatim, he said, it's just like my wife.
331000	335000	And I was like, okay, all right, swivel over to him.
335000	337000	Slippery slope.
337000	340000	Then he started talking about how his wife had been in a car accident
340000	346000	and he started describing the absolutely brutal details of this car accident
346000	349000	that involved also her children were in the car.
349000	354000	There's no question that he had total, yes, it's great.
354000	357000	All I could think of the entire time was go fuck yourself.
357000	362000	Fuck you, party, party guy with your wife accident.
362000	365000	I was talking to the tumor lady.
365000	369000	That's my only point is that I just found myself,
369000	372000	like this has nothing to do with good people, bad people, anything.
372000	374000	It's just like the weirdest human phenomenon.
374000	377000	I've got a glass of Chablis, I'm talking to this lady,
377000	381000	she's like, yeah, this thing is growing and then they MRIed
381000	382000	and then they radioactivated.
382000	386000	Well, my wife, the babies were bleeding and there was bacon on the highway.
386000	389000	All of a sudden there's a good guy and a bad guy in the story.
389000	391000	I'm just like, fuck this guy, fuck this guy.
391000	393000	I can't wait to go to the bathroom and talk shit about him.
393000	397000	What a piece of shit, fucking wife in a car accident, fucking cocksucker.
397000	402000	I just think that's a funny human phenomenon.
402000	406000	I'm sure he's not lying, but I knew he was a bad person.
407000	410000	I went to a charity thing a couple of years ago
410000	412000	and it was for children that had...
412000	414000	Fuck you, Jeff, I'm talking about the tumor lady of the year.
414000	417000	See what he's trying to do?
417000	423000	No, I was at a thing for a charity for children that had been burned.
423000	426000	I was sitting at a table, there were firemen there
426000	429000	and they have a lot invested in that because there are people
429000	433000	that are involved in the accidents that happen when people get burned.
433000	435000	It's a very emotional thing and there was a woman there I talked to
435000	438000	and she goes, fuck this, I fucking hate this fucking charity.
438000	440000	She was so bummed out about it.
440000	441000	Fucking burned people.
441000	444000	Because she told me, I was like, why?
444000	447000	What's your stakes in this?
447000	452000	I have a child that was born with an illness from birth.
452000	454000	She never had a chance.
454000	457000	These children had a chance to not get burned.
457000	459000	Yes!
459000	461000	Interesting.
462000	464000	I thought she was going to say...
464000	469000	She was saying, this is a bullshit charity.
469000	473000	I was like, I can't root for anything anymore forever.
473000	475000	See, that's very interesting.
475000	477000	Where do you...
477000	480000	Have you ever walked down the sidewalk, you're going to the grocery store,
480000	483000	it's 3 in the morning, you're...
483000	486000	Alright, midnight, whatever you fucking...
486000	488000	You're going to get pencil supplies.
489000	492000	Me, I'm going to get a bottle opener.
492000	496000	You hear a little meow, meow, meow.
496000	500000	You look and there's a little raggedy little dirt covered MacGuffin
500000	501000	like a little...
501000	502000	Meow, meow.
502000	503000	Inside the drugstore?
503000	507000	No, just another one of a million stray cats.
507000	509000	Meow, meow, meow, meow.
509000	512000	You know it's going to die if you don't or maybe it won't
512000	514000	or it'll end up in a shelter.
515000	518000	Then you pull back in your head
518000	520000	and you imagine a map of Los Angeles
520000	523000	and you go, okay, what if every stray cat in Los Angeles
523000	525000	was a little red dot?
525000	528000	The map of Los Angeles, as far as you could pull back,
528000	530000	would be a giant red dot.
530000	533000	It's just a condition.
533000	536000	It's misery, feline misery.
536000	539000	So you think that about the human condition too.
539000	543000	It is so weird, you go to a camp for kids who have been burnt.
543000	546000	How can you not be on the side of that
546000	549000	when your life has been affected by something other than that?
549000	550000	Other than that.
550000	552000	There are no heroes or villains.
552000	554000	It's crazy.
554000	556000	What fucking charity do you give to?
556000	560000	If you found a billion dollars under a rock tomorrow,
560000	564000	there's just this uncharismatic sort of fire
564000	567000	that keeps raging where you squirt your little fire hose at it.
567000	569000	That's called poverty.
569000	570000	Hunger.
570000	575000	It's the fucking count of me.
575000	578000	And then there's the charismatic tragedies
578000	580000	with the human faces on them.
580000	581000	I don't know.
581000	585000	What is the most charismatic tragedy?
585000	590000	I mean, let's ring tragedies in terms of charisma.
590000	592000	It's anti-geria.
592000	594000	It's the opposite of progeria.
594000	595000	It's old people.
595000	598000	They slowly become so adorable.
599000	601000	And let they die.
601000	604000	They get sucked up back inside a uterus.
604000	606000	Yeah, and it's like, fuck you guys.
606000	610000	But it's very tragic, but you can't tell from looking at it.
610000	613000	I want to bring a friend to the stage
613000	616000	because he's got a hard in and a hard out.
616000	620000	He's got a hard in and a hard out.
620000	622000	Yeah, he's dropping in by parachute
622000	627000	and then he's rolling out with a bayonet.
628000	632000	I don't do good interviews and I don't do good introductions.
632000	633000	Let's just bring him up.
633000	635000	James Urbaniak is here tonight.
649000	650000	Sorry.
650000	651000	Hard in.
651000	653000	Welcome to my poorly formatted show.
653000	654000	Thank you so much.
654000	655000	I listened to yours today.
655000	658000	I listened to episode 11 of your podcast.
658000	659000	Getting it on with James Urbaniak?
659000	660000	Getting on?
660000	662000	Getting on, not getting it on.
662000	663000	That's a very different...
663000	665000	It's called Hard In and Hard Out.
665000	667000	So James Urbaniak.
667000	670000	Your most recent episode is Lockdown.
670000	673000	And it's great.
673000	677000	There's lots of podcasts out there that super ego comes to mind.
677000	679000	It's just an experience.
679000	680000	There are people like me
680000	682000	who are just dumping their dumb narcissistic asses
682000	684000	into a microphone and pumping it out there.
684000	685000	And that's great too.
685000	687000	That's worthy of something.
687000	689000	There's a technique to your neurotic spluttering.
689000	692000	Somehow bird children are being helped right now
692000	694000	by me doing this.
694000	697000	But then there is the actual use of the medium
697000	701000	which is so charismatic and so envy inducing.
701000	703000	When I listen to that thing
703000	705000	and it's fucking fast and tight and amazing
705000	709000	and purely driven by your resonant tones.
709000	712000	You're Dr. Venture from Venture Brothers.
712000	715000	You are a professional voice actor.
715000	718000	You know what's for sale when you're talking to a microphone.
718000	719000	And I'm just...
719000	722000	Thank you, Dan.
722000	724000	And this thing, there's 11 episodes of it.
724000	725000	Please click on them and listen.
725000	727000	It's a fictional podcast.
727000	728000	You tell little stories in every episode.
728000	731000	Yeah, it's just like little short plays.
731000	733000	But the idea is that it's James Urbaniak's podcast.
733000	736000	But each month James Urbaniak could be a different character.
736000	739000	And the given circumstances of his life are completely different.
739000	742000	And so it's basically me like talking about stuff.
742000	745000	But like sometimes I'm assertive myself.
745000	746000	But like in the one you just listened to,
746000	748000	I'm the captain of a spaceship.
748000	749000	Yeah.
749000	751000	And then like this one where I'm a drunken college professor
751000	752000	who just got fired.
752000	754000	There's another one where I'm a guy who just experienced
754000	756000	a personal tragedy.
756000	758000	Just tying it together with the theme of this show.
758000	759000	Yeah.
759000	761000	And that one gets like really dark.
761000	765000	But it started out just because I wanted to just make something
765000	768000	in my house that was easy.
768000	770000	I mean relatively easy to make and just put it out there.
770000	772000	And then I asked a bunch of writer friends to write for it.
772000	776000	And then I've been writing with my writing partner Bree Williams.
776000	778000	And we've written like three of them so far.
778000	779000	Including the space one.
779000	780000	That's pretty great.
780000	782000	Easy to subscribe to.
782000	783000	And yeah.
783000	785000	And it's on the Feral.
785000	788000	It's on the FeralAudio.com with the Harmon Town.
788000	791000	It's part of the Feral family of stars.
791000	793000	You know there's a lot of very interesting things
793000	794000	in the Feral audio network.
794000	796000	We're doing a new thing where we take a little break
796000	798000	and do the Feral audio podcast.
798000	799000	Oh I didn't get the point of that transition.
799000	800000	It's an experimental thing.
800000	801000	It was my idea.
801000	803000	I thought you were sending up that kind of plug.
803000	804000	No.
804000	805000	Nope.
805000	807000	Do you want a musical theme for that?
807000	808000	Do you want to make it?
808000	809000	No.
809000	810000	No.
810000	811000	I think it's better to just have silence and then you go with that.
811000	812000	Okay.
812000	813000	Feral audio.
813000	815000	Let's talk about these kids for a second.
815000	816000	I mean.
816000	818000	Feral audio.
818000	820000	Feral audio.
820000	822000	I mean sure if you're a burnt kid.
822000	823000	Feral audio.
823000	827000	My favorite audio.
827000	831000	And there are groups of people out there who have it worst.
831000	834000	Burnt kids and people with tumors and things.
834000	837000	But Feral audio makes no money.
837000	841000	They're just a collective of brilliant people doing podcasting.
841000	843000	Just for the fuck of it.
843000	844000	That's right.
844000	845000	They're good people.
845000	847000	Because young Destin is about the work.
847000	848000	Yeah.
848000	849000	He just hangs out.
849000	850000	There he is.
850000	851000	Destin Marshall everybody.
851000	855000	Marshall, the founder of Feral Audio.
855000	856000	Only 12 years old.
856000	857000	He's only 12 years old.
857000	859000	People don't know that about Destin Marshall.
859000	861000	There's trademark cap and headphones.
861000	862000	He's never without them.
862000	863000	He's like a cartoon character.
863000	864000	He went to take the headphones off.
864000	866000	He was orphaned in 1892.
866000	869000	See him walking up and down Franklin Avenue in his cap and headphones.
869000	870000	Listening to podcasts.
870000	873000	His life truly, his headstone will say.
873000	875000	Destin Marshall.
875000	877000	Destin Marshall.
877000	880000	He's a little newsy.
880000	883000	Headphones and a hat.
883000	886000	Deep.
886000	888000	I was going to do a rap bridge for that.
888000	890000	Can I do a rap bridge?
890000	893000	Deep to the U, to the S, to the T, to the I, to the N.
893000	894000	All right.
894000	896000	That's all.
896000	900000	That was your spelling.
900000	902000	That's a very popular rap trope.
902000	903000	Spelling.
903000	906000	But the to the, yeah.
907000	908000	Yeah.
908000	913000	Destin Marshall's headstone will definitely have the words extra, extra on them.
913000	917000	They'll have little stone headphones over the to the stone.
917000	918000	Read all about it.
918000	919000	They'll be real.
919000	920000	They'll be real headphones.
920000	923000	And you can hear his plaintive wails from beyond the grave.
923000	924000	Yeah.
924000	925000	You can put them on.
925000	929000	I'm alive.
929000	932000	Gather ye rose buds while ye may.
932000	937000	I'm down here trying to court Marc Maron.
937000	943000	Did he go over to Marc Maron's grave and he's like, I don't need you.
943000	945000	So that's a gold brush right now.
945000	948000	The podcast industry.
948000	953000	Urbaniac, you played, you played Crumb in the movie.
953000	957000	Yeah, I did.
957000	958000	Yeah, that was exciting.
958000	960000	Was there any direction?
960000	962000	Did you research?
962000	964000	Well, I was when that audition came in.
964000	967000	You know, you audition for these things as an actor.
967000	969000	And usually you go, well, I'll do the best I can.
969000	974000	And when that audition came in, it was it was 2001.
974000	976000	That audition came in on the answering machine.
976000	978000	We had answering machines back then.
978000	981000	So it's the next position from your mom.
981000	983000	You come in like your catwoman.
983000	984000	James.
984000	986000	What are you going to meet the right girl?
986000	988000	The answering machine trope.
989000	993000	And then they said, you're auditioning with the American Splendor to play Robert Crumb.
993000	995000	And I thought, that part is mine.
995000	997000	No one else is more qualified.
997000	998000	I'm thin.
998000	1000000	I'm tall.
1000000	1002000	I'm an amateur cartoonist.
1002000	1003000	I saw Crumb.
1003000	1006000	I saw Crumb and I'm a fan of his work.
1006000	1007000	I have a hat like that.
1007000	1009000	Was Crumb had been out?
1009000	1010000	Did you?
1010000	1011000	Oh, my God.
1011000	1012000	I saw Crumb and it came out.
1012000	1013000	That's a masterpiece, that movie.
1013000	1014000	Oh, that's amazing.
1014000	1016000	And then I watched that like a loop.
1016000	1017000	Then I auditioned.
1017000	1024000	Oh, and the auditions for American Splendor were September 10th, 2001, 910.
1024000	1025000	Then what happened?
1027000	1030000	Then the callback was like six weeks later.
1032000	1034000	I had to wait forever.
1035000	1036000	It's true.
1036000	1038000	The auditions were in downtown New York.
1039000	1042000	The auditions were in downtown New York on Canal Street at Good Machine.
1042000	1045000	And it was illegal to go downtown for like four weeks.
1046000	1047000	Yeah.
1047000	1048000	Fucking terrorists.
1049000	1050000	They almost fucked up.
1050000	1052000	Was 9-11 an inside job?
1056000	1058000	I gave you a real good segue there and it's true.
1058000	1061000	I just watched two documentaries today and I've become...
1061000	1065000	I walked into the drawing room earlier today and Dan was sitting next to Dino
1065000	1071000	and Dan was clearly in the middle of a rant about the melting point of steel.
1071000	1073000	I've become one of these people.
1074000	1077000	Is that conspiracy guy, what's his face?
1077000	1079000	Barky McGee, you know, the one who's always...
1079000	1080000	McGruff?
1080000	1082000	Who's the famous conspiracy guy?
1082000	1083000	McGruff is the crime dog.
1083000	1084000	Alex Jones, thank you.
1084000	1086000	Barky McGee, I'm calling.
1087000	1089000	Was he in these documentaries?
1089000	1090000	Alex Jones?
1090000	1091000	Alex, no.
1091000	1094000	All right, because he just makes the living like making shit up.
1095000	1101000	Back in the day, anybody who was talking about the boiling point of metal
1101000	1107000	and the pancake and all this shit, I was so turned off by that stuff
1107000	1110000	because it was precisely because it was like, you know what?
1110000	1113000	No, don't romanticize this.
1113000	1117000	This is an actual... Jesus Christ, these people died and it's a fucking big deal
1117000	1121000	and more importantly, it's about the government's ineptitude.
1121000	1123000	I wanted to...
1123000	1126000	I remember being in therapy sessions and saying to therapists,
1126000	1128000	yeah, I'm just angry about this.
1128000	1131000	These people, they didn't do anything.
1131000	1132000	We pay our taxes.
1132000	1135000	You're supposed to be in this no-fly zone.
1135000	1139000	I thought you're supposed to clip your Dilbert cartoons
1139000	1142000	and have your coupons for cat food.
1142000	1147000	I thought the whole exchange was supposed to ultimately have to do with security.
1147000	1151000	But no, you can just... I was mad about it back then.
1151000	1152000	I was mad.
1153000	1157000	I never wanted to hear anybody saying, well, you know, they never...
1157000	1161000	Flight 77 is the kind of metal that on the plane, the tail couldn't have...
1161000	1163000	I was like, those people are quacks.
1163000	1167000	I don't want to talk to those people because they're trying to JFK-ify
1167000	1175000	something that is actually deeply patriotic, spiritual, important, personal.
1175000	1180000	But now I start, just today, I guess, maybe I hit some tipping point or...
1180000	1181000	I don't know.
1181000	1182000	What did you watch?
1182000	1185000	I watched these weird documentaries, whatever was available.
1185000	1186000	I don't know what happened to me today.
1186000	1188000	I just drifted into some weird cloud.
1188000	1191000	Maybe it's because of the community.
1191000	1195000	I was just looking for an escape.
1195000	1196000	The pressures.
1196000	1199000	I just wanted a Sunday to just escape into a cloud.
1199000	1201000	You should get fired again.
1202000	1204000	That would help.
1205000	1212000	I watched this documentary called Press for Truth, I think it was called.
1212000	1215000	And then another one that was called Zero.
1215000	1220000	The latter is the more sci-fi, what's the melting point of steel kind of stuff.
1220000	1224000	Press for Truth is actually kind of impressive because it's very deeply personal.
1224000	1230000	It's about the wives of victims going...
1230000	1232000	On a human level, they're just going...
1232000	1238000	They're not saying, I think that spaghetti was the motivation.
1238000	1242000	They're just saying, no one's giving us a satisfactory answer.
1242000	1244000	Anyways, guys, what do you think?
1245000	1247000	What's their theory?
1247000	1251000	Well, in the first one, there was this huge thing about Pakistan.
1251000	1254000	I'm sorry, Kumail's not here to...
1254000	1256000	To be bummed out.
1257000	1259000	I can't keep track of it.
1259000	1260000	Your head starts to spin.
1260000	1263000	That's the thing that conspiracy theorists have as an advantage.
1263000	1267000	Is this the thing where they're saying, oh, well, it was the American government did it themselves?
1267000	1272000	Well, certainly the second of the two, the one that's called Zero.
1272000	1276000	Yeah, absolutely, the implication is that it's an inside job.
1276000	1281000	Dan, if you had to guess right now with what limited information and intelligence that you have...
1281000	1282000	As is my job.
1282000	1285000	I'm not saying you have to be right.
1285000	1290000	But if you had to go from your gut with what facts information you currently have,
1290000	1292000	what do you think happened?
1294000	1296000	I swear to God, I'm not kidding.
1296000	1299000	I have no idea. I don't know. I swear to God.
1299000	1301000	Do you think a plane hit the Pentagon?
1303000	1304000	God damn it.
1305000	1307000	Now, I watch these two things today.
1307000	1309000	Yesterday, I would have said...
1309000	1310000	From your gut, Dan.
1310000	1311000	TMZ's not here.
1311000	1315000	Yesterday, I would have said, yes, there is no gut. That's the problem.
1315000	1318000	I watched two documentaries today.
1318000	1320000	Here's the problem with conspiracy theorists.
1320000	1322000	They're still processing, is what's going on.
1322000	1325000	Conspiracy theorists, that's a dangerous industry.
1325000	1328000	They get to leave out things that don't service them.
1328000	1333000	There's something marketable about saying JFK didn't get killed by Lee Harvey Oswald.
1333000	1336000	That's why this guy, Alex Jones, he makes a living doing this.
1336000	1339000	You're incentivized every inch of every magic bullet's pathway.
1339000	1341000	You're incentivized to fudge.
1341000	1345000	And that's not cool when you're dealing with stuff that people actually care about.
1345000	1349000	Would you be more content knowing that it actually happened as reported
1349000	1354000	or that there actually was like, you know, hocus pocus going on with the government?
1354000	1356000	I would actually, I would be way more sad.
1357000	1367000	I hope to God that 19 fundamentalists, guys from Saudi Arabia climbed into planes
1367000	1370000	and did horrible things and flew them into things and that that was that.
1370000	1375000	I would so would much rather life be like that.
1375000	1378000	These things take you down a rabbit hole, though.
1378000	1381000	You just go like, you're so unsatisfied by that truth.
1381000	1385000	James, this is the point in the show where the guest has to start interviewing Dan.
1385000	1389000	James, what do you think? James, come on, tell us, James. James, tell us.
1389000	1393000	Well, the government venture. What do you think?
1394000	1399000	9-11 was an inside job.
1399000	1403000	See, see, Dr. Betcher doesn't say see.
1405000	1408000	I think the government already.
1408000	1411000	Well, the people in power already had a wet dream for many years
1411000	1415000	that some tragic event would happen that would allow them to go off preemptively,
1415000	1418000	knocking off like dictators and stuff.
1418000	1422000	And so and, you know, there's this thing called the Project for the New American Century,
1422000	1425000	which what? P.N.A.C.
1425000	1430000	Yeah, exactly. Those are the letters that were in Washington Square Park here.
1430000	1436000	And there's a thing in there that says we really want to go off and knock off dictators.
1436000	1438000	But we need we need a really good incentive to do it.
1438000	1440000	We need like a Pearl Harbor and then.
1440000	1442000	But then you think that you're really going to get it back.
1442000	1446000	And then September 2001, Christmas came early to the people who wrote that document.
1446000	1452000	So I can see why you can kind of conflate that desire and change it around a little bit
1452000	1455000	and say those people made that happen. But they didn't.
1455000	1459000	Except that no dictators ever get knocked off and the economy is not booming.
1459000	1463000	And there is no like I could I could see how those guys that would be their wet dream.
1463000	1467000	But I don't think they engineered it. No, I don't think because obviously it did not work out.
1467000	1470000	I mean, G.W. was he's not acting that he's shocked.
1470000	1475000	He's just sitting in a fucking kindergarten class for like 10 minutes going, I don't know what to do.
1475000	1479000	I honestly don't know what to do. This is never I never thought it would lead up to this.
1479000	1484000	And I think all I can do is sit here for 10 minutes as sexy as all conspiracy theories are.
1484000	1489000	And see when you watch these very convincing like documentaries about, hey, man, if the planes hit the Pentagon,
1489000	1494000	where's the engines, Jack, man, because the engines will be there because I made a titanium man.
1495000	1497000	Oh, shit. Where are the engines? That's all cool.
1497000	1503000	But I don't think that that's endowing our government with better abilities to keep secrets and lie.
1503000	1509000	I think they might actually be so inept lies that complicated seem absurd.
1509000	1515000	Also, yeah, to do that much weird shit like in your wildest dreams, this government would be capable of being a good government,
1515000	1524000	certuitous like stuff. And then they're like, well, if they had that much brain power, the bridges wouldn't fall down while people were fucking driving across them.
1524000	1528000	Maybe it's just that when when horrible shit happens, it's always chaotic.
1528000	1532000	You always wonder how a piece of skull ended up on one wall.
1532000	1536000	It never makes sense. And then you and then you have 10 years.
1536000	1540000	What wall are you talking about?
1540000	1545000	It's a metaphorical wall of order in the wake of chaos, like Pink Floyd.
1545000	1547000	Okay.
1547000	1557000	A beloved president is assassinated. Two towers come crumbling down like like like in a flash like our world changes.
1557000	1569000	And then we spend the next 15 years going like, OK, well, you find a candy wrapper on the floor and you go, you trace it back to the idea that that hopefully there's more order than chaos in the world.
1569000	1575000	But the truth is, boy, but man, I learned a lot about metallurgy today.
1575000	1580000	I think you're receptive to this, these alternative histories.
1580000	1588000	And it's like you're receptive to it because there are stories and you adore stories and you pay all stories for their terrible stories.
1589000	1593000	But we crave sense. We want order.
1593000	1602000	We'll never know, you know, lots of things about history, but we choose to make order out of things out of chaos.
1602000	1605000	We know why it happened and it still doesn't make any sense.
1605000	1616000	I mean, I'm going to go home and Google the right phrase for debunking the debunking of the debunking and stuff because I just heard too much today about the melting point of steel.
1616000	1618000	It just disturbed me too much.
1618000	1622000	I want you to have another vodka and just fucking dive into a real conspiracy right now.
1622000	1626000	I want you to like I see I see your your leg tapping eagerly right now.
1626000	1629000	I think you're on a threshold of really revealing.
1629000	1634000	I got it. Yeah. America wasn't in those buildings. They evacuated them.
1634000	1639000	I don't know what to tell me. All right. So don't chicken up me now, man.
1639000	1642000	I think you I think you have a look. I am a human being.
1642000	1644000	I am a human being. I you know what I think was amazing.
1644000	1647000	The most amazing thing was that there was one guy in both documentaries.
1647000	1652000	I saw there's like these little cheesy videos that like people make.
1652000	1655000	There's one guy in both of them whose son died at 9 11.
1655000	1660000	And I loved like his catchphrase in the second of the two documentaries.
1660000	1671000	He was like he's like this like good natured like dad like that was talking the way I hope my dad would talk if I died in a horrible tragedy.
1671000	1676000	That didn't have an abundance of forensic evidence surrounding it.
1676000	1680000	He just said hey look I'm not a conspiracy theorist.
1680000	1685000	My son got murdered. I'm trying to find out who killed him.
1685000	1689000	It's fucking like really. I was like shit.
1689000	1694000	I want that to be my dad. Can you dedicate. And I will do that for my son.
1694000	1699000	Can you dedicate an entire season of community to answering that question.
1700000	1702000	What if you did that.
1702000	1709000	It just takes a turn. Donald Glover leaves and then like this is like this plane hits Greendale.
1709000	1713000	It's a paper airplane so it's charming.
1713000	1717000	It's like a paintball plane.
1717000	1722000	I dare you. I Jeff Davis dare you.
1722000	1726000	It's just the season of paintball.
1726000	1732000	Is there any way I can make people happy with 13 episodes speaking of which I don't know man.
1732000	1737000	All paintball. What if what if all paintball. That wouldn't make people happy.
1737000	1745000	What if no paintball. That wouldn't make people happy. I'm not complaining but I am under a personal gun.
1745000	1751000	What would you do if you had not that budget is a concern necessarily but like if you had your dream.
1751000	1758000	Is there have ever been ideas kicked around in the writers room as you're putting a new season together where you would say like God I wish.
1758000	1763000	What if we could just do this. What would be one thing that you wish you could do but you can't get away with.
1763000	1766000	What if Donald was in the show.
1766000	1772000	Just keep. It's just been five weeks of us going.
1772000	1776000	No no no nothing like that. Honestly I mean I never know.
1776000	1781000	No I would I want to reground the characters and do like awesome compelling shit.
1781000	1793000	I think I think I think every kind of community fan would agree that like remedial chaos and Dungeons and Dragons are like at the center of the Venn diagram of like everybody being happy.
1793000	1805000	You got the shippers are happy. The psychology is there. It's like it's not. Yeah paintball is awesome but that's like a that's like a slight offshoot of episodes that are you know you have to take the character seriously.
1805000	1813000	And of course we're going to do that for the fifth season. So I'm not that worried. I'm just a little worried that you only get 13 and I'm worried.
1813000	1819000	Okay I'm worried. How many of you written so far. Zero.
1819000	1824000	I just I've taken up heroin and I'm just sitting in my office.
1824000	1834000	I just keep staring at old Vanity Fair articles about the show just just eating grilled octopus and shooting up.
1834000	1840000	Now we've broken like five five episodes like broken the stories.
1840000	1849000	Yeah. All right. Why do you ask James. I was just curious. You want to be in one of them. Please. If there's a part for a person.
1849000	1854000	All right James we got it. We got it. We got to let James go. But before we do we're going to we're going to.
1854000	1859000	If there's if there's a persnickety passive aggressive professor who makes his way through there who has an affair with Britta.
1859000	1867000	You know that's right out there. It's that easy. Yeah. Just throw that out there. Yeah.
1867000	1873000	And just like the 9 11 guys you don't have to take it to heart destroying it out opening a door in your mind.
1873000	1880000	Anything you want to plug or anything while you're up here. I don't know. You're reading a book or appearing in a water.
1881000	1889000	There's like stuff but the venture brothers and just listen to the podcast. Getting on with James Rabinia. Yeah. Feral audio dot com. Definitely listen to it.
1889000	1904000	Thank you James Rabinia.
1904000	1911000	James Rabinia. I don't know what I'm doing.
1911000	1922000	It wasn't out of my outline. I was like bring James Rabinia. Then ask him if 9 11 was an inside job. And then and then never ask him another question.
1922000	1929000	Of all the people that you've not interviewed while they're out here. He took it the best. He's a good sport.
1929000	1937000	I mean if he wants to stay he can stay but he had a hard out. Yeah. I'm a bad I'm a bad interviewer. I've been forthcoming about that.
1937000	1945000	What do you think is your what keeps you from being a good interviewer. Concern about other people. Right. Definitely.
1945000	1951000	That's not true. You are concerned about the people but you get more concerned. I'm concerned about how they feel about me. Right.
1951000	1966000	So you start interviewing yourself through their eyes. Yeah. So like my inner. Yeah. It's like like if if if Gore Vidal came up here I'd be like do you. Is there mustard on my face. Bring somebody up in the audience right now and interview him. Just try to try to interview him.
1966000	1976000	OK. This guy. This guy is so excited. OK.

1994000	2012000	Alberta. See Dan what I'm doing right now is what I'm doing is interviewing. Yeah exactly. Fuck you Gibran get out of here. It's done. Gibran. What's your birthstone. Garnet. OK. What's left for me. So now Dan take it from there. OK Gibran. How tall was your mom.
2012000	2037000	5 1. See. I don't know. Well that's weird. You're taller than 5 1. Dan a stranger is on stage with you right now. You've never met this fellow. OK. He raised his hand eagerly. All right. What. Is there no drive. Gibran Gibran. Like OK. You're from Canada. I am. Came to the show. I did. Your name is Gibran.
2042000	2071000	How long you in town. I'm leaving tomorrow morning. Why. Because once I've seen this what else is there to do. Right. I'm a good interviewer. Thank you. Thank you. Gibran. What's with the what's with the weird name. Wow. It's a got you question then. It's a got you question. Fair question. Is it a common name. What part of what part of Canada.
2072000	2100000	What part of Canada. Calgary Calgary Alberta. OK. Forget your name. That's stupid. Google his name. Who cares. Gibran. What are you most afraid of. Don't say spiders. Slipping into solipsism. OK. Like me. So you'd be a bad interviewer. Probably. All right. Now Gibran.
2100000	2129000	Interview Dan. Act like you don't. Yeah. You don't know me. Or no. You can act like you know me. That's OK. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to control the interview. When two solipsists go to war. Tell me. Both guys just look at the floor. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about my friend. Tell me. Tell me what it felt like to play D&D for the first time. Oh my God.
2130000	2158000	That's a great question Gibran. Thank you. I love D&D. I mean I honestly I can I can barely remember but like one of the most remarkable memories I have that mark that is that I remember mowing my lawn because I had to mow my lawn and I remember that the like I hated mowing the lawn because it's just repetitive activity but this is before iPods it's before you can occupy your brain with anything.
2158000	2180000	And I just remember mowing my suburban front lawn going back and forth and the whole time I was just thinking about what we had just done in in D&D just like so like this awakening this idea that that I had a different life that I was a different person and that these things had happened that they were scenes like in a movie that had never existed.
2181000	2201000	Good question. What a good interviewer. Now let me let me counter with this. What's your favorite color? Blue. No pink. Sorry I know I'm not supposed to do Monty Python jokes. Yeah Monty Python jokes are fun.
2202000	2212000	Well what's it like to interview me? Follow up question. All right. OK. All right. So you like why do you like D&D. How old are you. What race do you hate the most.
2215000	2230000	Which speed of yours is bigger. I hate I hate gnomes. You're an elf. No I'm sorry. OK. Yeah. How old are you. 35 35. OK. And so what was you answered the same question. What was your big memory with D&D.
2231000	2243000	I was just so that I could ask answer that question. I knew that this was coming. I played for the first time when I was nine and I actually didn't even know that it was playing Dungeons and Dragons.
2243000	2260000	It just came in this like little red box and a guy across the street from a friend he played this game and I had no idea that you could like just envelop yourself in another world and like create all these things that just were so alien
2260000	2275000	to the life that you live. The idea that it's actually OK to say even though I'm just sitting here being a fat guy with his face I'm actually doing this other thing. I'm actually this other person.
2275000	2291000	Which is like we're all familiar with it. It's under our nose but the emotional experience of like actually. Yeah. I mean allowing yourself to like be heroic or be like be the center of your own universe.
2291000	2301000	I mean I guess we all are the center of your own universes but it's on a grander scale. So what do they do in Canada.
2302000	2314000	Just on a just on a typical day. I'll start. I'll start. It's 8 in the morning. I'll be a Canadian rooster which I'm sure sounds different from an American rooster.
2314000	2330000	I'm sure it's got some weird use of you in there. You all wake up and go. I'm about to eat some breakfast.
2330000	2351000	We watch hockey. We wake up. We turn on the TV. There's no like channel changing on the remote. It just it turns on and off. And then it's just TV at a really loud ball. It's just hockey hockey in a really loud ball.
2351000	2363000	Or call a mockery is on there or hockey. I feel like every time I every everything I've ever seen on the Internet that I was a community related like like where someone's like making a really creative gift or doing like a good YouTube video.
2363000	2378000	There's always that city TV logo that and that's Canadian right. It's like we're really good. You're not paying for anything. We're really great at pirating. Yeah. But you also like you know you love good TV. Yeah.
2378000	2400000	And by good I mean my TV. We know that what you meant. Are you born and raised in Calgary. Yeah I am. What's this is 17th Street while the bars are 17th Ave. That's right. Were you there. Oh yeah. Oh wow. I've been many times and there's a bar called like the crown and thorn of a Rosencrown.
2401000	2413000	That's Alberta. That's right Alberta. My I have relatives. My family. I had a family reunion in Alberta. Oh really to see them. Where. I don't know. I didn't go.
2413000	2440000	I just a bunch of people related to me are like hey come up here. If you ever need a surrogate to go for the next one you just I'll see you. Now Dan we can. There was a lady running around. My parents went. My parents went and they said God I'm so annoying. There's this lady running around and talking about how we were all six six degrees separated from a pope.
2440000	2465000	And my mom was like we all are like everyone is like Kate Menard. All right. And again we're learning more about you in this interview than Gibran. We cannot leave. We cannot get him off the stage until we've learned at least equal amounts about Gibran before he goes. OK. I leave that to you. So people people who are listening to the podcast at home we haven't specified yet. Gibran is a seven foot two African-American.
2465000	2494000	Tattooed like Queequeg and Moby Moby Dick. He has tribal tats over the left side of his face. He's holding an ivory spear. Purple. Purple streak to it. So I have something to say about that because my fiance she sometimes when she meets new people are and they ask about about me then she says oh his name is Gibran. They're always like oh he must be big and black. They're so disappointed when they see me.
2495000	2497000	Dan follow up questions.
2500000	2502000	If you were if you were black.
2504000	2506000	What would you do first.
2510000	2511000	And last.
2512000	2534000	Because for real I would do Jeff. Let's all answer this question. There's so if you could if you woke up tomorrow black like there's something you do right. I'm asking. I would instantly go fuck with white people as hard as I could. But how where. I would just I would just good naturedly intimidate them.
2535000	2546000	See I think I would. I don't know but I was about to say I would go to some mythical place where only black people are allowed but I wouldn't. That wouldn't. It wouldn't. There's no. This doesn't work that way. It's called prison.
2550000	2551000	Good night everybody.
2553000	2554000	You fucking pussies.
2555000	2561000	He walked into that. Yeah. No. It's not like there's some bar that's called like the black gentleman.
2562000	2575000	We live in Los Angeles. There are neighborhoods where you could go into where there are places that you could sit. Yeah there's places where if I walked in being white I would feel less comfortable but I don't think if you walked in being black you'd be like hey put it up my tab.
2577000	2587000	Would you walk into a bar in Inglewood and like just try to like try to. I don't know from Inglewood. That's my thing. I don't know. I don't know. That's the thing. I haven't put that much thought into it.
2587000	2599000	I just know that there's like yeah if my if I if I walked into a place and everyone was black and I was the only white guy I know that I would feel like like an interloper and like like bummed out.
2600000	2609000	But I know I know from going to junior high that that they were not as bummed out about that as a bunch of white people with a black person would be.
2610000	2619000	I don't think there would be any profit from walking it like I guess I'm just thinking about it now like if I woke up black if I had the superpower press a button on my bracelet.
2620000	2622000	First of all okay I'm black now.
2624000	2635000	When you wake up black just like you get to pick what kind of black person you are. Well then I'd be super sexy black. Well that's that's a different thing. I'm assuming I'm a dumpy black guy.
2636000	2645000	How about you get to be any black person you want male female sexy otherwise. So I just get to be just straight up handsome as black guy in the world. That's different.
2646000	2654000	You could be like a funny like wise cracking old 50 year old black lady you know. I would just be a strapping fucking amazing black guy that was able to jump over a car.
2656000	2661000	I'm choosing. I get to choose. You get to choose. Well then I'm mega black.
2662000	2675000	I'm super super in the James Bond of black men. I'm Billy Dee Williams in 1982. I'm like fucking. I'm just walking in fucking like.
2676000	2681000	Okay. So you say you're Billy Dee Williams sexy. Billy do I'm wearing he's not even black enough. I don't know what I am.
2682000	2685000	Hey fuck you people. Fuck you honkies.
2686000	2697000	I just pressed my black button. I'll tell you who's black enough. Billy Dee can go fuck himself. What are you talking about. So be a fucking rich visceral fucking black guy.
2698000	2712000	So Dan you're you're the you're mega black. You're you're you're super fucking potent black. Okay. What it's kind of doodle do the alarm clock goes off. What do you do first. You get up. You eat a big black breakfast.
2713000	2728000	Which consists of what. Tons of protein and I don't know. I'm so glad you're asking these questions. I don't know what's what's on your plan about. You only have 24 hours of this.
2729000	2743000	So much pressure. I go go to some. There's got to be some black parlor where you can like download with other black people about what do you do. I don't know. I think that's I don't know. You don't you don't have that. You are just a white man.
2744000	2756000	I'm at my house. So oh my god. I'm a sexy physically fit beautiful black. All right. So Aaron's Aaron's next to me. You said that first is your fantasy man. Well Aaron's like holy shit. You're black. I'm like yeah.
2759000	2761000	We probably got to. How does she how does she know.
2766000	2775000	Is that wrong to say. Well when you say knock that out. What are we talking about. Well I mean if she woke up with blue hair and be like hey. You know.
2776000	2796000	Viva la difference. Let's fucking do it. So we're assuming she wakes up and she's comfortable and she knows that she can recognize through. Because again you said I'm not the Dan Harmon version of a black guy. I'm not. You're. I'm not like a big dumpy. I got to choose to be a child. I have a I have a wingspan. Yeah.
2797000	2817000	I got my chest is like a Buick's grill. My biceps are the size of a child's head. I'm like every. I just look like a cartoon. Right. That's that's what you think black people are. No. That's not fair. There are people. No it isn't fair.
2817000	2846000	You said I got to choose what kind of black guy. Children's heads are shaped like biceps. I don't want you to be a black person. Well I don't. Okay so you wake up and you're Kevin Garnett. You're fucking. Who's that. Okay now we learn more about you. You said you're just a very tall strapping. Physically fit strapping good looking black gentleman. Yeah. What you have done.
2847000	2874000	Twenty four hours to do something. What's what's on the fucking docket. All right. I fuck Aaron but good. She's earned it. Quick breakfast. High protein. I don't know what. Right. Out to my car. You get. You get. You get to pick a car too. You get to pick a new. No I don't. No I don't. Because you're trying to trick me into being racist.
2877000	2906000	And I'm not. Well I'm not. Well done my my proud newbie and friend. I go down to my fucking silver Prius and I and I and I slide into it proudly with my cosmopolitan black body. And I go to the drawing room. My usual haunt because I want to know what it's like to walk in there black. Okay. And I go and I order my usual drink. I would like a kettle one of the rocks please. And.
2906000	2935000	Okay suave like that. Okay. Here you are. That'll be six dollars. Thank you. It's good to drink at a place that understands me. I don't know just feeling them out. Okay. So let's say they're totally fine. I go over to the jukebox. Right. I want to put on some little Wayne. Little or little. Because there's no little Wayne on the jukebox.
2935000	2964000	I'm not going to fuck around with the jukebox. I don't know. Okay. That was a joke. Okay. So I got to drink up my usual haunt. All right. Now what am I going to do. Twenty four hours. All right. Twenty one hours. All right. I'm black. But I look good. I'm like fit. Like I'm ripped. Oh yeah. You're you're in your peak physical condition. So then I'm going to do shit that has nothing to do with being black. I just want to be ripped. Like I want to like I want to. Well then you can just go to the gym dude.
2964000	2993000	No that's the whole point. You don't have to go to the gym. That's what that's what you don't have to be in good shape. Or to fuck your girlfriend properly. Fine. Let's hear from Gibran everybody. Thank you Gibran.
2994000	3012000	Can I just make a shout out. Sure sure. Happy birthday to my cousin Ivan and eat your heart out Les Wong. Thank you. All right. Gibran. Canadians. Dan I have to say that was a hell of an interview.
3012000	3040000	You really are bad at it. You don't know other people exist. That guy sat on stage here with a microphone in his hand never spoken to it and you simply didn't care at all. Yeah but he was like you know he was like oh I want to come up here. I mean how do you know he deserves it.
3043000	3057000	Maybe maybe that was karma but he said he was he was solipsistic and so are you in that way. He did good. He did fine. He did great. He got everything he was going to get. Gibran from Canada. He got a little.
3058000	3075000	Where is he going to get. We're going to carry him out on our shoulders. We wanted to find out if you could actually invest interest in another human being. All right. All right. What's what's your name. And a Tory. Oh shit. Totally get on stage.
3075000	3102000	Okay. All right. Totally. That's an exotic name. The names are getting weirder. Jeff. Totally. Where are you from. From Russia. Oh shit. All right. All right. So you're just visiting. No study here. What's that study. Oh you study. You study in where. What school.
3102000	3130000	In UCLA. Oh it's part of a like an exchange program. Just keep you up to study. So I did directing. How do you how do you starting directing of what film TV. So were you directing in Russia. No. I just came to study. You just came over and said I think I'll try directing. Yeah. Why is the whole note. Well I mean it's just you know a lot of us a lot of directors in this audience are out of work right now.
3132000	3160000	I'm sorry but fuck you guys. Wow. At the Russian at some point he must break you. So how old are you. I'm 23 23. God. Oh man. Just your life pulsing through your little sinewy Russian veins. Do they have black people in Russia.
3160000	3189000	Really few. Yeah. In my town. I think like it was three black people. So what were their names. And we're going to check. If one's your brand we're going to spell around. What were your parents rich. Would you call them rich. Middle class lower class middle class.
3189000	3207000	Yeah. So how do you how do you how do you get hooked up. I don't understand. Can you explain the process that gets you to get to come over here to UCLA to study directing. Just for those of us listening to Russia right now. It's called airlines.
3207000	3236000	Actually I can start from far along when I was born. But I like. I like movies. I like TV shows. I like. I think I watch a couple of community. Yeah. Yeah. You saw a couple of. Like it was. I think it was about inspectors space time convention. I think it was. I like. I like your job. Yeah. But that was fourth season.
3238000	3257000	It's all right. It's okay. Doesn't matter. Okay. He can't tell. So so you just like this is the world we live in now. You're just sitting in Russia and you go like I want to I want to direct TV and you just fucking like up and came over on a plane.
3258000	3283000	And nobody grabbed you at the border and was like what are you doing. What are you trying to do. Get out of here. You have to get a student visa. Yeah. Yeah. Oh student visa. Yeah. It's pretty actually it's pretty hard. How long how long do those last four years. No it's well studied. You can study like almost all your life. So it doesn't matter. So you just have to keep like filling out a form. I don't know. I don't know that much yet.
3284000	3304000	Do you have friends over here. Not really many but a few people. You just are you in a dorm room at UCLA. No no no. I just went in a room with you at a park. Oh really. It's just a one bedroom apartment. No it's a two bedroom with two guys. So like how did you find the roommates. Craig.
3304000	3325000	So what do you want to make. I'm sorry. I hate you. I jump in. I'm so fucking tired. No. I thought I did a good job. I instinctively jumped in as Jeff Davis because I saw you flagging over there and you held your cup very close to your lips and you wanted to sip. Yeah. But you were doing a really good interview there. He's so Russian.
3326000	3340000	Talk to him Jeff. What part of Russia are you from. It's a middle of Russia. It's it's a town called Orenburg and no one heard about it. Are you that one guy would go. Yeah.
3341000	3354000	But I think it's like a Russian student coming over here to direct. Are you a big fan of like Russian film or are you a film student or are you more of a TV fan. I don't know. I mean did you do you love. Are you this directors that love their like you know.
3355000	3375000	That love their foreign film love their classical films and like you're a big scholar of filmmakers. Are you more just like want to do what you want to make. That's great. I don't really like I like some Russian like old films. But now it's like really terrible business in Russia.
3375000	3387000	Like every like only one move out of like 100 days was to Washington. So it's nothing to do in there. Who do you think is interviewing you better right now.
3387000	3401000	I'm here Jeff. I feel like his interviews more like it's like more boring like wines more personal. And I tell you who's the most passive aggressive interviewer.
3401000	3422000	Right. But if you got if you had your dream job if you could make whatever you wanted what kind of show or what would you make as a director. Do you want to do TV or movies for sure. It's like it's really for sure TV.
3422000	3440000	I mean that's because it's like TV you have like two weeks of work and get money and buy and you don't have to sit in like developing for five years and without money. What's your favorite American TV show. They're not not your favorite but just a random one.
3440000	3465000	Madman Madman Madman Madman. Would you want to direct it. You want to direct our stuff like that. Is that what you would want to do. I don't know. You are starting directing right. Yeah. All right. Wait. Can you. Okay. Jeff and I are going to do a scene and you're going to direct us.
3465000	3491000	We're going to do it from Madman. We're going to try. It'll be like from Madman like not a real scene but and then you will do one take and then you adjust us. You say you say cut and then you adjust us and then we'll do another take. OK. So I'm done. I'm done. Draper. I've never seen it. So I'll be Al Sharp. Al Sharp.
3491000	3516000	I'm John Draper. I'm Al Sharp. I'm a new I'm a new intern named Al Sharp. OK. Oh Mr. Mr. Draper. I didn't realize you were going to be in this early. Al I'm always going to be in this early when the Heinz account gets this fucked up. I'm sorry. I was here earlier and I saw that somebody has spilled coffee all over the Heinz account. It's not your job to worry about coffee spilling. It's your job to be a madman.
3521000	3550000	Anatoly. Give us notes. Give us notes. So adjust us. So what can we do better in that scene. OK. First of all you need to change your clothes. OK. He was talking to Dan. He was talking to Dan. I think you'll find that I'm properly dressed for a Madmen scene. That's true. I can't. I mean I'll. OK. Well describe what you would have him wear. What should he do.
3550000	3579000	What should he be wearing right now. Something like something like I'm wearing. Yes. So should everybody Anatoly. I like this guy. He's a good director. So far he's a great wardrobe supervisor. I feel like I just got insulted but I can't tell.
3579000	3608000	I didn't hear what you said. Say again. I think like maybe someone may hire me to make a TV show like if you have fun. You should get a TV show. I think they should get Dan Harmon a TV show. Oh sure. Yeah. Yeah. But now you have to give us direction and tell us how to do that scene better. It can't just be wardrobe. I think first of all it's this scene must be written.
3610000	3626000	It needs a script. You're a producer. OK. So better written. We'll do it again but better written. He needs a better script for the people who need to be dressed better. This is confirming a lot of theories I've had about the profession of director.
3626000	3652000	I've had a sneaking suspicion that I know what goes on when I'm not around. But you want to try it again better directed or better written rather better written. Oh OK better written. We'll do it again. You're in a skinny mod suit and then the seat is better. I'm impeccable. OK.
3653000	3672000	What was your name. Army Sharper. I'm Al Sharpton. You're Don Draper. OK. But I'm a young intern. OK. Yeah. All right. Oh. Draper. You'd be better off saying winter because a cold wind is going to blow up your asshole.
3672000	3689000	I got the Heinz account right here in the floor but 57 reasons to fuck you in the ass. Then pour it over every fry because it's 1968 and Vietnam motherfucker.
3690000	3710000	And it's only everybody. Thank you. That is good director. And it's only good. That is good directing. And it's only you saw him here first. He's the new Spielberg. All right. Let's get Spencer up here. Let's play some.
3713000	3714000	Spencer.
3714000	3743000	Get your satchel. Hello Spencer Crittenden. How are you sir. Hey hey hey hey. Hey any any any new fun stories about being my assistant. OK. So one of the writers rooms is like there's a long table in there's a room for about like five or six seats on either side.
3743000	3756000	And it's just full of clutter. And this one time Dan was all like Spencer give me a five hour energy. And I was like I already have one. And I pulled one out of my auxiliary pocket because that's where I keep it.
3757000	3767000	And I was on the other side of this long table and I slid it all the way down the table and it got like right to him and he caught it and everyone was like.
3767000	3795000	Yeah there's not a lot. I mean everything Spencer does though has that air of mystery to it. Spencer came in. I told him to go get me a sweatshirt out of my car. And then he came in at one point where because it's season five so everyone's very quiet.
3795000	3807000	A bunch of very smart funny writers in there. But like and I don't think I'd have it any other way I guess. Like we hired a bunch of people who are like very enamored with community. We got a bunch of geniuses there who are brilliant scripts.
3807000	3819000	But the upshot is it feels like teaching a Harvard law class like that writers are just like a bunch of young smart funny people just sitting there. They don't physically raise their hands before they speak but none of them speak over each other.
3820000	3845000	Isn't it one of the writers here tonight. Yeah. Alex here. Alex here. Will you come up here for a second. This could be at his peril. I mean yeah just grab up just grab a mic for a second. I just I heard you were here in the writers room.
3845000	3868000	His Canon films t-shirt. Canon films or no it's OCP. So what's it what's it like working for me. It's great. All right.
3868000	3884000	But it's quiet in that room right. Yeah. You described it well as I mean the genius part was nice. People aren't quiet because I'm a bad person. I know. Well I can speak only for myself. I mean I think you know we're all awkward people because I'm amazing.
3884000	3898000	It's it involves you but not in a more in the amazing way than in the like you're going like oh god Dan talking like about what should happen in this episode. Why would we ever want to say anything else.
3898000	3912000	I mean I feel like I'm I'm on one half of a bit that's going on right now and I just got a little insecure like I choose. I have blinders on. I go like OK. Well I hired everybody and they're all very quiet.
3912000	3923000	So I'm going to make the conscious decision that everybody's being really quiet because I'm amazing. But then there's a little voice in the back of my head that goes you're embarrassing yourself.
3923000	3930000	Well I'm stuck in my own head sort of the way you are in your head. So I know that if I say yes then I'm going to feel like I'm kissing your right.
3930000	3940000	You're my boss. Right. Everyone. Yeah. The other writers are listening and they go. Oh Alex was on. I'm speaking for myself. I'm very excited about this job and I don't want to fuck it up. Right.
3940000	3956000	So if I if I am going to like speak up I want to I'm I care how it lands. Right. Well you're doing great. But let's just run down the other writers. So what do you think. Ryan Ridley like right.
3956000	3971000	Clearly only got hired because he's a friend of mine. Ryan took a lot of abuse the first week. All right. Thank you. I don't know what you could possibly do if there's anything you want to plug.
3971000	3985000	Alex Rubens Ruben town. Yeah. Community season five starting. Five. See you at Comic Con. All right. Alex Rubens.
3985000	4000000	See what I'm going through. Did you see his pants his shorts. Those were awesome. I want those shorts. No. What. I like Alex. I think he's a great way. He seems like a good guy. Of course he's a great writer. I read his script. What are you going through.
4000000	4011000	Going through being in a room with 14 people whose scripts are all great writers and they're just like I'm kind of going like OK so Troy is allergic to cheese then what if Abbott said this and that's kind of like.
4012000	4025000	Very quiet. Yeah I want to I want to talk a lot but that's not my job obviously but I feel like Jesus Christ these are silences that are these are pregnant pauses like it's not just me. No.
4025000	4040000	It gets awkward like I think one time I clocked in about three minutes of silence. But but but in your opinion OK as a 12 year old however old you are. OK. It's not should I regress for this question. It's not.
4040000	4067000	It's not because I'm untalented right. It's because I'm super talented. Right. I don't know what it is. Lie to me lie to me. It's because I intimidate everyone. We love you Dan. It's because you know just. Your intellect is very tangible. You know. And they feel it. Spencer if I play the music will you give us your internal monologue during one of the community writing silences.
4071000	4073000	Nobody's talking.
4077000	4079000	Still nobody's.
4081000	4085000	My mind reels with possibilities of things that could be said.
4086000	4092000	Good ideas. Bad ideas. They all bubble up. But why isn't anybody fucking talking.
4092000	4121000	That's how you write a TV show. I think I think it's because they all have 200 IQs. I think they're all they're all onion Harvard. Yeah well it's like he was saying it's like you're all up in your head and you're like these guys are staring at me like I'm brilliant or an asshole and there he's in his head and he's like man this guy's looking at me like I'm either about to say something genius or a big asshole and like all the other writing writers are like oh man he just said something good I look like an asshole and that's probably what everyone's thinking about.
4122000	4139000	This whole time just assholes. That's true. But in the meantime 13 episodes of the greatest television and show in history. Hang in the lurch. Yeah. Hang in there. Tell them that. Heroes heroes are going to rise and fall like well this is the fucking I'll do it myself. Punch a wall.
4140000	4160000	You think I should get two and a half minutes into one of these three minute silences. Just go. What am I doing here. Exactly. But then they'll be like what do you mean. You hired me. And I'll be like I'm sorry. Yeah. You should get Anatoly to come in and direct how to how to run a writer.
4160000	4182000	I should dress different. That's what we're teaching Russia by the way. And I'm not surprised they're getting that message. That's what that's it's empty stylistic masturbation. It's like come on. You like Breaking Bad though right Anatoly. Well they dress very well in that show.
4190000	4210000	The whole planet's just going to just collapse like a balloon culturally. We did it. America won. This is our punishment. We didn't we never knew what we were doing. Only thing we ever did was go America's great. And then and now that's the culture is just like.
4211000	4239000	It's done. The only good shows are about people shooting up and dying. Like we're celebrating our death. But your show doesn't really fit into that does it. I mean it doesn't Jeff. I mean I mean that sincerely. Thank you. You're intentionally not playing ball with that paradigm. That's correct. And it's a lot of pressure isn't it. It's a lot of pressure. Yeah. Right Alex. Yes. Okay.
4239000	4268000	I'm Dan. I want to play the Spencer music but you're going to do dungeon master voice when you're helming the writers room. Last season wasn't very good. But you found out you're not allowed to say that anymore. Seizing the power of the high road. You took it all the way to having permission to do whatever you want. But what will you do.
4269000	4298000	Having had the right to do muppets and animation removed from you creatively. You sought to figure out how you could possibly deliver a quality show under historically low budget. Well insidious evil studio looms above you hating everything you do demanding that you pitch it to them but not having a right to say no to anything.
4298000	4327000	Meanwhile in the bowels underneath you 16 year old girls wait patiently with their Tumblr blogs. You can either let them down or let them down. In any case your show will possibly air if it ever does air in the worst time slot on the worst network and the worst time for television and television history.
4327000	4340000	Jackson wreck may be your lead in.
4340000	4346000	I tried to time it right.
4346000	4353000	All right. Let's let's get Aaron out here and play some play some.
4354000	4360000	To the stage.
4360000	4371000	Yeah you can't wait for the variety headlines huh. You love you love your famous boyfriend. I do you love my famous boyfriend. You love those Michael Oscello headlines.
4371000	4389000	I mean a full disclosure I'm still I'm still a little drunk from that neighborhood party with the with the tumor lady. It was crazy. Well I mean it certainly was not crazy but it was a party and I drank a lot to get along with people.
4390000	4407000	I want to hang out with her more like I find myself now I think it's a 30 versus 40 thing I think of the 10 years between 30 and 40 mortality becomes Breaking Bad because like I I just find myself like you're waiting for it to come and it's just like a finding.
4407000	4425000	So you see somebody whose foot has been chopped off by a boat propeller and you're just like like tell me more about that because you start like preparing yourself for like whereas before that like from 29 to 30 you're just like I don't want.
4425000	4436000	I don't want like like that's that's not good. I don't want to go down that rabbit hole. I just find I think maybe it's because I'm 40 I'm just like hey you're you almost died.
4436000	4440000	You have a t-shirt.
4440000	4446000	I don't want to argue with you but I think that's a human thing if that makes sense. We were in two different conversations but I think that's interesting.
4446000	4449000	What was yours about.
4449000	4454000	My conversation at the party was not as cool.
4454000	4471000	I was making jokes about drinking red wine and a woman asked me what I was doing and I told her very honestly like I don't know why paint my drink and I do whatever and I'm worried about myself and she's like I'm a casting director you audition for me and I was like cool cool cool.
4471000	4472000	Great. Great.
4472000	4478000	You never know what's going to happen on the patio next to Dan Harmon's house.
4478000	4482000	But it was a great party was the most fun I've ever had. What did you drink.
4482000	4483000	Yeah.
4483000	4487000	Something from Passayo Robles.
4487000	4490000	Passerobles.
4490000	4497000	Yeah a grape. It was something made from grapes and it was red vodka wine wine.
4497000	4504000	It was wine. I poured it in a glass that looked I mean the top was white and then it went down to a thing.
4504000	4509000	Thank you wine glass. Yeah. And I had several of those.
4509000	4523000	Are you OK. No I don't. I don't think so. Are you. Are you going to puke. No I don't think I'm going to puke. Let's play D&D.
4523000	4527000	Last town on Harmon town.
4527000	4532000	Our heroes had just felled a bearded demon during the fight.
4532000	4536000	Mole rain slough slab squat thrust.
4536000	4542000	This threw the group into a tense moral dilemma regarding the value of life.
4542000	4550000	Not really Sharpie didn't really care so the gang moved past it after hacking a group of entangled lemures to death.
4550000	4558000	They discovered Sharpie's father mango butts a lot buried up to his neck at the bottom of a large pit.
4558000	4570000	Mango butts a lot told the heroes of dark stars assault on the world how he destroyed mountains and pillaged cities and was enslaving people to power strange eldritch engines of doom.
4570000	4577000	Mango asked Sharpie to head towards dark stars black keep far to the north to put a stop to his evil plans to aid the party.
4577000	4584000	Mango also set yurch a dubious move that seemed like somewhat of a halfhearted gesture given the circumstances.
4584000	4589000	And with some last minute advice mango sent the adventurers off to the north.
4589000	4602000	You're suggested that the party stop in either Thornvale or Fornheim the frozen city in order to seek aid from their military as the fortress was known for its outstanding defensive and offensive capabilities.
4602000	4610000	So onward they marched to Fornheim and then to the black heap to stop dark stars rain.
4610000	4617000	Spencer.
4617000	4620000	All right so we're on our way to Thornfield.
4620000	4621000	Thornheim.
4621000	4622000	Thornheim.
4622000	4623000	Fornheim.
4623000	4627000	I knew it was a Jewish name.
4627000	4631000	All right and we're going to encounter random encounters on the way.
4631000	4633000	Not that I'm metagaming.
4633000	4643000	As the days and miles pass the vegetation grows sparse the sky colder and darker rolling hills turn into high mountains and winding passes.
4643000	4654000	Wind through treacherous trails as you trudge up the mountains you round a bend and catch sight of it a dazzling crystalline fortress of blue and white sparkling in the cold winter sun.
4654000	4662000	Fornheim the frozen city but lying between you and the city gate is a massive white bridge entirely composed of ice.
4662000	4670000	The slick white ice bridge looks treacherous glistening and shimmering stretching across a great white void of howling screaming wind.
4670000	4671000	Quirk.
4671000	4681000	Yes I can't remember why we came here because mango told us to go to the black heap and this is the way to get there I think.
4681000	4685000	And also that's all I remember.
4685000	4689000	But I have the armlet of winter and we're going to cross an ice bridge.
4689000	4695000	Maybe I can reinforce this by calling forth my power of winter to reinforce this rickety city bridge.
4695000	4697000	No you'll be popular here for a change.
4697000	4698000	That'll be great.
4698000	4699000	Whoa.
4699000	4700000	Whoa.
4700000	4701000	Whoa.
4701000	4702000	I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry.
4702000	4703000	What the fuck.
4703000	4704000	Sorry.
4704000	4705000	No that's weird.
4705000	4710000	Because I was just we were everything was cool until just now.
4711000	4712000	I just sometimes.
4712000	4714000	Are you saying I'm not popular wherever we go.
4714000	4715000	No I'm saying you are.
4715000	4716000	I'm saying you said it.
4716000	4718000	You said it pretty sarcastically.
4718000	4719000	Well sarcasm.
4719000	4720000	You're very popular.
4720000	4721000	Thank you Maureen.
4721000	4724000	What the fuck is up with this dick.
4724000	4725000	Everywhere we go.
4725000	4728000	You get you get the right arm you let for something.
4728000	4729000	I get it.
4729000	4731000	It's called arm let first of all.
4731000	4735000	You call it arm you let like you got like a dumb dumb.
4735000	4737000	Can we not fight and can we have a password.
4737000	4738000	I was totally cool.
4738000	4742000	And I was going to reinforce the ice bridge and we could all go in there like friends
4742000	4744000	but you were being like a weirdo.
4744000	4745000	Is ice bridge broken.
4745000	4747000	No he said it was rickety.
4747000	4753000	I mean I can see non-metagamically looking ahead of me that this this ice bridge looks
4753000	4755000	like it could use some reinforcing.
4755000	4760000	Spencer do I have power of make the other people in my party kiss so we can let go of
4760000	4762000	some tension.
4762000	4763000	There's diplomacy.
4763000	4765000	Yeah they fucked in a tree.
4765000	4766000	They fucked in a tree.
4766000	4767000	I think so yeah.
4767000	4770000	It depends on your definition.
4770000	4774000	Wait what you guys fucked in a tree.
4774000	4780000	Look if you're not going to show up for every episode then.
4780000	4784000	On purpose.
4784000	4787000	You don't fuck accidentally up a tree.
4787000	4788000	Fine fine.
4788000	4790000	If you're fucking in a tree.
4790000	4793000	Well knowing that maybe you guys should just fuck now.
4793000	4795000	How do we move on.
4795000	4796000	Metagaming.
4796000	4798000	That's not metagaming.
4798000	4800000	That's not metagaming.
4800000	4806000	Maureen is pro fucking.
4806000	4811000	I walk up to the edge of the bridge and with a sick out one toe to test its stability.
4811000	4813000	This bridge is rather thick.
4813000	4818000	It's maybe five or six feet thick and it extends quite a ways.
4818000	4820000	I saunter past his checking.
4820000	4822000	300 feet.
4822000	4824000	It seems sturdy as he saunters out.
4824000	4827000	I'm just walking.
4827000	4829000	See you at the other side.
4829000	4832000	My good ex friend.
4832000	4839000	I spit on my stomach and I slide across.
4839000	4841000	Oh no no wait I dry my stomach.
4841000	4845000	Yeah.
4845000	4848000	Wait halfway through sliding you dry your stomach.
4848000	4851000	I'm realizing if I spit on my stomach I'll be at the front of my stomach.
4851000	4853000	Yeah it'll make you stick.
4853000	4858000	I blow my stomach and then I slide across.
4858000	4864000	Oh okay you get like seven feet.
4864000	4866000	How far across is the bridge?
4866000	4871000	It's like 300 feet.
4871000	4875000	I giggle like I was doing a joke and I stand up.
4875000	4878000	I stay at my edge of the bridge and I yell out to Sharpie.
4878000	4881000	I say hey look man I don't know what that was about back there.
4881000	4884000	Look this bridge might not hold us all.
4884000	4886000	Get to the other side and then I'll come after you.
4886000	4887000	All right.
4887000	4889000	I'm sorry too about what happened.
4889000	4892000	Yeah it was out of the fucking left field.
4892000	4893000	I've been drinking.
4893000	4894000	Really?
4894000	4895000	Yeah.
4895000	4896000	What have you been drinking?
4896000	4897000	If I could.
4897000	4901000	Oh in the game?
4901000	4904000	What game are you talking about Spencer?
4904000	4906000	Experience points.
4906000	4907000	That's not fair.
4907000	4909000	He's not allowed to do that.
4910000	4913000	I'm allowed to stay in the game and immerse myself in my tree.
4913000	4915000	You guys didn't actually fucking a tree right?
4915000	4916000	Like in real life.
4916000	4918000	I scanned the horizon for trees.
4918000	4919000	Are there trees?
4919000	4920000	There's no trees.
4920000	4921000	There's no trees?
4921000	4926000	It was kind of like my own private Idaho that was just like still shots of us doing different stuff.
4926000	4932000	With my armament of winter I called down a sleet in rain and it's no storm to fashion an ice tree.
4932000	4935000	Okay.
4935000	4940000	I just go like walking like crazy, like high stepping, like stomping with every foot.
4940000	4943000	No that's definitely happening.
4943000	4945000	Also the sleet.
4945000	4946000	Yeah.
4946000	4953000	So it's already kind of snowy but you're whipping it up into a frenzy and it's getting quite strong and treacherous.
4953000	4957000	As if like maybe strong winds might blow you off a slippery bridge.
4957000	4958000	Okay I stopped doing that.
4958000	4959000	Okay.
4959000	4960000	I said winds.
4960000	4964000	I was just testing out my ability to fashion ice trees.
4964000	4965000	That didn't go so well.
4965000	4966000	Okay good.
4966000	4967000	It didn't even happen.
4967000	4970000	Look, look, forewarned is forearmed.
4970000	4973000	Yeah.
4973000	4974000	Meanwhile.
4974000	4976000	It is what it is.
4976000	4978000	You're stepping onto this bridge.
4978000	4980000	Knowing is half the battle.
4980000	4982000	The bottom line at the end of the day.
4982000	4984000	Stop, drop and roll.
4984000	4993000	You hear the sound of crunching ice and snow and coming out of the edges of this bridge are these large black poles.
4993000	4999000	They're kind of extending from the ground up into the air and they start buzzing in a strange weird sound.
4999000	5004000	And you see kind of lines and runes glow light up on their surface.
5004000	5006000	Makes a buzzing sound.
5006000	5007000	It's kind of weird.
5007000	5008000	Along the sides of the bridge?
5008000	5009000	Yeah.
5009000	5012000	So it's as if like maybe railing popped up but not the railing, just the posts.
5012000	5013000	Gotcha.
5013000	5016000	But they're big and they're about 10 feet tall and black.
5016000	5017000	And they're buzzing.
5017000	5018000	And they're ominous.
5018000	5019000	I don't like it.
5019000	5020000	You don't.
5020000	5021000	So I'm still not on the bridge.
5021000	5022000	Mulrain's not on the bridge.
5022000	5023000	Sharpie's out there on the bridge.
5023000	5025000	You're right at the beginning of it.
5025000	5027000	You're about halfway and you're, yeah, you're seven feet.
5027000	5030000	Sharpie has her navel stuck to the bridge seven feet across.
5030000	5031000	Mulrain.
5031000	5032000	I mean, Mulrain does, right?
5032000	5034000	I mean, you're not stuck.
5034000	5035000	You're just prone.
5035000	5037000	I'm just an asshole.
5037000	5039000	You're just lying there.
5039000	5040000	I like these.
5040000	5044000	These are posts that are like, posts that are like buzzing and...
5044000	5047000	Yeah, they're like buzzing posts.
5048000	5051000	I keep moving forward trepidatiously.
5051000	5052000	All right.
5052000	5053000	That happens.
5053000	5054000	Hesitantly.
5054000	5056000	You don't feel impeded.
5056000	5058000	Then I start bounding.
5058000	5061000	Like a juvenile poppy.
5061000	5062000	All right.
5062000	5070000	Can I throw a rope around Sharpie and kind of use him like a sled dog?
5070000	5072000	Wall lying down?
5072000	5073000	Sorry?
5073000	5074000	Wall lying down?
5074000	5076000	Well, maybe I get up a little bit and then I throw up.
5076000	5077000	Okay.
5077000	5078000	Just enough to, you know.
5078000	5081000	Oh, Mulrain, if you lie down, I'll get on you like a surfboard.
5081000	5084000	Oh, yay.
5084000	5088000	Yeah, get on me like a surfboard.
5088000	5089000	Nicole.
5089000	5090000	Yeah.
5090000	5091000	Yeah, get on me like a surfboard.
5091000	5093000	What do you mean, get on me like a surfboard?
5093000	5096000	You just tied your rope to him while you're laying on your stomach and you wanted a sled across.
5096000	5099000	Why not get on me like a sled?
5099000	5105000	Well, I'll stand facing forward as opposed to sideways like a surfboard.
5105000	5108000	I thought I'd, you know, just, you know.
5108000	5109000	Get on me any way you'd like.
5109000	5111000	I thought we had a pact where we were going to play together.
5111000	5112000	No, we do.
5112000	5114000	I'm dealing with you guys fucking in a tree.
5114000	5115000	Are you guys together?
5115000	5118000	That was like back on the shadow plane.
5118000	5119000	I don't even remember that.
5119000	5121000	No, it's fine with that.
5121000	5122000	It's fine.
5122000	5123000	That was pre-shadow plane.
5123000	5125000	That was last week.
5125000	5127000	In this party, we all fuck whatever we want.
5127000	5128000	It happened last week.
5128000	5129000	It's totally fine.
5129000	5130000	It's still like shadows of fire.
5130000	5131000	All right.
5131000	5132000	It doesn't matter.
5132000	5133000	It doesn't matter.
5133000	5134000	It's all cool.
5134000	5135000	This is a party.
5135000	5136000	Yeah.
5136000	5141000	The rope, it doesn't go as far as you'd hope and it doesn't land around its shoulders
5141000	5143000	or reach him.
5143000	5144000	Okay.
5144000	5148000	Because I'm bounding like, I don't know if you've never seen footloose, right?
5148000	5154000	Like the side shot of Kevin Bacon, like the Dolly shot where he's just bounding like through
5154000	5155000	the steel mill.
5155000	5158000	It's like a Bob Fosse skip.
5158000	5161000	Every step is like another move.
5161000	5163000	I'm just bounding, bounding, bounding.
5163000	5167000	Maybe you slip and fall.
5167000	5168000	Did you do a skip check?
5168000	5169000	I did.
5169000	5170000	Okay.
5170000	5171000	He failed it.
5171000	5172000	All right.
5172000	5173000	Well, I get up and I continue doing it though.
5173000	5174000	Yeah.
5174000	5175000	Because I'm...
5175000	5176000	Your spirits can't be taken.
5176000	5177000	All right.
5177000	5180760	Well, using my fast barbarian movement, I just run out and try to get as much ground
5180760	5181760	across the bridge as possible.
5181760	5182760	All right.
5182760	5185000	I try to grab his ankle like a surfboard.
5185000	5186000	All right.
5186000	5191120	You grab his ankle and are slid onto the bridge.
5191120	5194200	Being grabbed by your ankle, you find it a bit hard to move.
5194200	5195200	Yeah.
5195200	5196200	No shit.
5196200	5197200	Yeah.
5197200	5202320	Even so, you make your way onto the bridge in the midst of these budget pillars.
5202320	5204800	This episode is just called crossing a bridge.
5204800	5205800	Wrong.
5205800	5206800	I can't.
5206800	5209360	Crossing a bridge wrong.
5209360	5214920	You hear a far off clang sound and then you hear the sound of distant cannon fodder.
5214920	5217120	I mean fire, not fodder.
5217120	5218120	That doesn't sound like anything.
5218120	5219120	Cannon fodder.
5219120	5220880	That just sounds like people that are going to die.
5220880	5223360	How far across the bridge are we?
5223360	5224360	You're about halfway.
5224360	5225360	Okay.
5225360	5226360	I keep running.
5226360	5227360	Yeah, you do.
5227360	5228360	I keep surfing.
5228360	5229360	All right.
5229360	5232040	What do you keep doing?
5232040	5236120	I actually do one roll.
5236120	5237280	Like a combat roll.
5237280	5240320	No, like a leap and a roll.
5240320	5241320	I call that a combat roll.
5241320	5242320	I just keep bounding.
5242320	5243320	Oh.
5243320	5244320	Yeah, okay.
5244320	5245320	Okay.
5246320	5260360	As I'm traversing the bridge, I'm just saying, my locomotion is fueled by a juvenile angst.
5260360	5261960	Like I'm mad at my dad.
5261960	5266440	I'm mad at having to read Catcher in the Rye.
5266440	5270920	I don't know why I have to do anything except smoke and drink.
5270920	5274560	I'm just going, and I'm just bounding.
5274560	5277520	That comes off in your bounds.
5277520	5283840	Anyway, you see three large dark shapes hit the ground right in front of you.
5283840	5285880	You're the farthest forward, so you're the closest.
5285880	5287160	They're about 10 feet off.
5287160	5288160	Who is me?
5288160	5289160	No, Sharpie.
5289160	5290160	He's far as long.
5290160	5291160	Oh, he's bounding.
5291160	5292160	He's bounding.
5292160	5293160	Yeah, he's bounding.
5293160	5294160	Smoking and drinking.
5294160	5295160	I'm holding you back.
5295160	5302040	Yeah, but those things, they hit the ground, and you hear cracks in the ice as ice cracks
5302040	5303280	start happening.
5303280	5304280	Like that, yeah.
5304720	5311960	And rising up out of the three craters, you see three dark cloaked figures.
5311960	5313400	I'm the closest to them, right?
5313400	5314680	You're the closest to them.
5314680	5321280	I hold my hands up and say, all hail dark cloak figures.
5321280	5327120	I am an emissary of peace from my selfia.
5327120	5331160	Sit figures are dark, ogre-sized skeletons.
5331160	5335000	They wear heavy black fur cloaks and charcoal-colored plate armor.
5335000	5337880	Their eyes blaze with a cold blue fire.
5337880	5341440	You can hear the grinding sound of metal gears turning.
5341440	5344680	The grinding becomes a clattering and then a silence.
5344680	5349800	The skeletons drop into combat poses as large, frozen swords materialize in their hands,
5349800	5352200	melding together from ice and snow.
5352200	5355360	Gentlemen, please.
5355360	5360320	No need for that.
5360320	5362080	Can we get over there somehow?
5362080	5367080	Maybe we do the same Sharpie lunge.
5367080	5371880	And I go, I go, I go, gentlemen, please.
5371880	5380720	And then I wreath my arms in shocking grasp electricity, and I go, no need for that.
5380720	5383240	All right, that happens.
5383240	5386360	As you're speaking, two of them surround you.
5386360	5391240	They're on either side of you, and the third opens its mouth, and from within, you can
5391240	5399720	hear kind of a tinny voice from deep inside go, Fawnheim is the stronghold of the strong.
5399720	5404280	And then the two guys flanking you lunge.
5404280	5408920	They strike you quicker than lightning with their icy blades.
5408920	5414040	Gay.
5414040	5423160	And by that, I mean equal.
5423160	5427720	Dealing 15 damage.
5427720	5430560	Gay.
5430560	5431560	Meaning empowered.
5431560	5435480	Yeah, like fucking, who's going to contain these people?
5435480	5442000	I run up behind the recently wounded Sharpie, and I shoot, and I take out my armlet of winter
5442000	5446840	and do a sleet and snow attack at them to try to blow them off the bridge.
5446840	5448920	Yeah, okay.
5448920	5453680	So activating your armulate, you whip up the winds and sleet in a frenzy.
5453680	5454680	Armlet.
5454680	5455680	It's armlet.
5455680	5456680	Oh, sorry.
5456680	5458080	I think armlet's clever.
5458080	5459080	It's cool.
5459080	5460080	You're welcome.
5460080	5462440	It's like a bracelet on your arm.
5462440	5463440	Yeah.
5463440	5464440	All right.
5464440	5465440	Well, I mean, that's what an armlet is, right?
5465440	5467000	Well, as an amulet for your arm?
5467000	5468080	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5468080	5469080	You wrote armlet on here.
5469080	5470080	I know.
5470080	5471080	It is definitely an armlet.
5471160	5473560	You guys should do a podcast called Jewelry Time.
5473560	5477240	It says armlet, A-R-M-L-E-T.
5477240	5482840	And with wintry powers wreathing your body and surrounding you, you charge headlong into
5482840	5488280	one of the skeleton dudes.
5488280	5493880	You miss, but your momentum carries you skidding on the ice, and you tackle and clumsily knock
5493880	5498040	into him, and the two of you are kind of sprawled out on the floor in a heap.
5498040	5499040	Cute.
5499040	5500040	Yeah.
5500040	5502520	Am I open to an attack again, or am I now open to an attack?
5502520	5503880	It's now Mulrane's turn.
5503880	5504880	All right.
5504880	5510040	I run up, and where everyone is standing now is not on the bridge, right?
5510040	5512200	It's on the other side.
5512200	5514280	They're like three quarters of the way down the bridge.
5514280	5519600	Right now, you're about a midway down it, so you're standing off of it.
5519600	5520600	Okay.
5520600	5524040	Well, I run up to where everyone is.
5524040	5525040	Okay.
5525040	5528440	I create flaming armor for a second.
5528440	5529440	Yeah.
5529520	5532160	How powerful is this flaming armor?
5532160	5536800	It wreaths you with flames that don't feel hot to you.
5536800	5538800	But do they feel hot to an ice bridge they're all standing on?
5538800	5540800	I'm just wondering if I'm going to destroy the bridge, yeah.
5540800	5541800	Let's...
5541800	5544000	I mean, you don't know that.
5544000	5545960	You just know they're not hot to you.
5545960	5547560	Maybe fire on an ice bridge.
5547560	5553560	Well, I mean, you know that you could deactivate it if it starts causing problems.
5553560	5554560	Okay.
5554560	5556560	I'll take your word for it.
5556560	5558560	All right.
5559200	5562320	I mean, can I slide past them?
5562320	5566320	Like Risky Bizness?
5566320	5570320	Can I Risky Biz slide past?
5570320	5572320	That's what Tom Cruise did in that movie.
5572320	5574320	He slid past enemies.
5574320	5577320	Called a fireplace.
5577320	5579320	He just slid.
5579320	5582320	He slid past his parents' rules.
5586320	5587320	Okay, well...
5587320	5588320	Yeah, that happens.
5589080	5590080	Oh, I slid past?
5590080	5591080	Okay.
5591080	5596080	If I slid past, I create flaming armor that's on fire.
5599080	5602080	On a bridge made of ice?
5602080	5603080	No, no.
5603080	5604080	I slid past.
5604080	5605080	I slid past.
5605080	5607080	Oh, you're still on the bridge.
5607080	5608080	All right.
5608080	5609080	Well, okay.
5609080	5612080	Well, I give them both eye contact this look.
5612080	5615080	Like, if it starts to go bad.
5615080	5616080	I got no problem.
5616080	5618080	I mean, it's a bridge made of ice.
5618840	5620840	It's not like, you know...
5620840	5622840	I mean, what's below the bridge?
5622840	5624840	Probably heaven, right?
5624840	5626840	I'm sure there's a lot of ice infrastructure.
5626840	5628840	Okay.
5628840	5630840	Melting point of ice.
5632840	5635840	Somebody asked, what's the melting point of ice?
5635840	5637840	This pancake theory...
5637840	5639840	Okay, okay, this is what I do.
5639840	5642840	I put on the flaming armor, but I hop.
5642840	5643840	Okay.
5643840	5644840	I'm hopping.
5644840	5645840	I'm constantly hopping.
5646600	5650600	So the fire's not really making contact with the ice bridge too frequently.
5650600	5653600	So I'm just hopping along and hopping and hopping.
5653600	5655600	So there's just a slickness.
5655600	5657600	So it makes the bridge better.
5657600	5659600	So you're on fire and hopping.
5659600	5661600	I'm on fire and hopping.
5661600	5663600	And what else?
5663600	5673600	And I fire a flaming arrow at the one in the front.
5673600	5675600	The one in the front.
5676360	5678360	Losing your flaming arrow, it hits.
5678360	5680360	Critically so.
5680360	5682360	Oh!
5688360	5690360	Dealing.
5690360	5692360	I can't do math.
5692360	5694360	16 damage.
5694360	5696360	Oh!
5696360	5698360	Oh!
5698360	5700360	Shit!
5701360	5703360	Your hopping seems to be working.
5704120	5706120	Putting it in.
5706120	5708120	Sharpie's turn.
5708120	5710120	Oh.
5712120	5714120	Sharpie's in the ice bucket.
5714120	5716120	Sorry.
5716120	5718120	Well, I've been thinking about this for a while.
5718120	5720120	And...
5720120	5723120	I think that guy died in the audience.
5727120	5729120	Okay.
5729120	5731120	I'm up close to all these guys, right?
5731120	5732120	Yeah.
5732880	5734880	That's what all the Urbans say.
5738880	5739880	Yeah.
5739880	5740880	All right.
5740880	5741880	Shocking grasp.
5741880	5743880	Because I've just had a lot of success with that.
5743880	5745880	And I just...
5745880	5747880	I've just had it up to here.
5747880	5751880	Having it up to here, you lose a shocking grasp.
5751880	5757880	You shall let me pass!
5757880	5759880	Something like that.
5759880	5761880	Yeah, that's good.
5762640	5764640	Nice.
5764640	5767640	That's a less than shocking grasp.
5767640	5771640	Am I still tangled up with the guy that I was close to?
5771640	5773640	Yeah, you're in a heap.
5773640	5775640	How high is the railing on this bridge?
5775640	5777640	There's no railing.
5777640	5779640	So it's just a flat bridge?
5779640	5783640	I just use my brute strength and try to just grapple them and throw them off the side.
5785640	5787640	All right.
5787640	5789640	You grapple them and you have them firmly, but you can't throw them off.
5789640	5791640	Right now you're just kind of wrestling with them.
5792400	5793400	Shit.
5795400	5797400	I kiss them just to make it creepy.
5803400	5805400	Like right at the base of the ear.
5807400	5809400	It's creepy.
5813400	5815400	Yeah, it's creepy.
5815400	5817400	All right.
5817400	5819400	He is creeped out.
5820280	5822280	No, they're not affected by that.
5822280	5826280	But neither does he manage to wrestle you off of a bridge.
5826280	5828280	So you guys are just kind of locked in a sand still.
5828280	5830280	Fair enough.
5830280	5836280	At the same time, two of those skeleton dudes that aren't being wrestled attack.
5836280	5840280	One lunges towards Sharpie having been shocked by Sharpie.
5840280	5842280	The other lunges at Mulrain.
5842280	5848280	I point out as he's attacking me that he has no muscle tissue.
5849160	5853160	That he's made on a pure bone.
5853160	5855160	No muscle.
5855160	5857160	No muscle tissue.
5857160	5859160	He's an animated bone.
5859160	5861160	Which is lame.
5861160	5863160	He might as well be rock.
5863160	5865160	Okay.
5865160	5867160	Or a rainstorm.
5867160	5871160	Like it's not, I want him to know that I'm not concerned.
5871160	5873160	He strikes you dealing.
5873160	5875160	12 dead.
5876040	5878040	Are you concerned now?
5880040	5882040	Okay.
5882040	5884040	You're keeping track of my hit points, right?
5884040	5886040	Yeah.
5886040	5888040	Am I dead?
5888040	5890040	You have eight left.
5890040	5892040	Oh shit.
5892040	5894040	Yeah.
5894040	5896040	So I'm like, is that all you got?
5896040	5898040	That kind of thing.
5898040	5900040	The other one swings at Mulrain.
5900040	5902040	But she nimbly dodges.
5902040	5904040	Now it's Mulrain's turn.
5904040	5906040	Okay.
5906040	5908040	I'm going to do, okay.
5908040	5914040	I put my hand near the face of the monster.
5914040	5918040	Not on his face because I don't want to hurt him.
5918040	5922040	I put my hand near the face of the monster.
5922040	5924040	And I make eye contact with his blue eyes.
5924040	5926040	And I say,
5926040	5928040	I'm you.
5938040	5942040	I've similarly met adversaries who I didn't understand.
5942040	5944040	And I want to say that I understand you.
5944040	5946040	And you can destroy me if you'd like.
5946040	5950040	But I just want to understand and love you.
5950040	5952040	And my friends are good.
5952040	5954040	And we won't hurt you.
5954040	5956040	Please let us across your bridge.
5956040	5958040	Also my friend Cork will blow you.
5958040	5962040	And he will blow you.
5962040	5966040	But I'm all teeth.
5966040	5970040	But meanwhile, you're in this hug stand still with one of his friends.
5970040	5974040	While that's happening, I'm still kissing a skeleton.
5974040	5976040	We both lock eyes.
5976040	5980040	I'm waiting to hear, see what the response is.
5980040	5982040	I almost want to take it back.
5982040	5984040	I almost want to take it back.
5984040	5988040	Well, can I take that back?
5988040	5990040	I don't want it to be sexual.
5990040	5992040	I just want it to be human.
5992040	5994040	I don't say he can blow you.
5994040	5996040	But I do do my eyes and I go,
5996040	6000040	No, I don't do that.
6000040	6002040	I just look at him.
6002040	6004040	What do you do then?
6004040	6008040	You can also attack these fucking things that are getting us.
6008040	6012040	I use my diplomacy.
6012040	6018040	And I appeal to their humanity.
6018040	6020040	Their humanoid.
6020040	6022040	Their skeletality.
6022040	6024040	They have skeletons, right, guys?
6024040	6030040	No, we're all bone skeletons when the flesh goes away.
6030040	6032040	Yeah.
6032040	6036040	He strikes you with his frozen sword.
6036040	6040040	Dealing eight damage.
6040040	6042040	All right.
6042040	6044040	You know what?
6044040	6046040	And I look at him and I say,
6046040	6048040	I get it.
6048040	6050040	That's fine.
6050040	6052040	So maybe next time around he'll...
6052040	6054040	Yeah.
6054040	6056040	Turn the other cheek, right?
6056040	6058040	Yeah.
6058040	6064040	Sometimes I think that these creatures are you.
6064040	6066040	I know they're probably not.
6066040	6068040	But sometimes I think that you're thinking,
6068040	6070040	Fuck you, Aaron. No, no, no, no.
6070040	6074040	That's why they're all skinny.
6074040	6080040	Wait, you want me to blow, Spencer?
6080040	6084040	Spencer, I'm all teeth.
6084040	6086040	Fun question.
6086040	6088040	Sharpie, get in the fight.
6088040	6090040	Yeah, Sharpie's turn.
6090040	6092040	Shh.
6092040	6094040	Shh.
6094040	6098040	Shh.
6098040	6100040	Heal up.
6100040	6102040	Move out of brain.
6102040	6104040	No, no.
6104040	6106040	Kick it in the balls.
6106040	6108040	Not scorching brain, no.
6108040	6110040	Ray of frost.
6110040	6112040	Ray of frost is a level zero spell
6112040	6114040	that does one to three damage that I was...
6114040	6118040	I like how this is turned into the price is right.
6118040	6120040	The kitty litter.
6120040	6122040	The kitty litter.
6122040	6124040	I don't mind it.
6124040	6126040	I do appreciate the input.
6126040	6128040	But I do think I've had the best luck with...
6128040	6130040	And, Dan, we are very close to the end of the show.
6130040	6134040	So whatever you do, put a flourish on it.
6138040	6140040	It zooms into my eye,
6140040	6144040	and then you see my dad hitting me with a belt again.
6144040	6146040	And then it comes back out,
6146040	6148040	and you just see, and this is my gimmick.
6148040	6150040	It's just...
6150040	6152040	Choo! Choo!
6152040	6154040	Shocking grasp!
6154040	6156040	And I grab one of the skeletons.
6156040	6158040	I'm not reinventing the wheel.
6160040	6164040	Yeah, yeah, you do grab the skeletons.
6164040	6166040	Dealing.
6166040	6170040	16 damage.
6170040	6172040	Whoo!
6174040	6176040	You hear a sizzling sound from Deeth within it,
6176040	6180040	and then it catches fire and falls to the ground.
6180040	6182040	Dan!
6182040	6184040	Hey, guys.
6184040	6186040	Hey, guys.
6186040	6188040	I say, uh...
6188040	6190040	I can't riff one.
6190040	6192040	Looks like you're...
6192040	6194040	Have Anatoly help you.
6194040	6196040	Anatoly?
6196040	6198040	Direct the last line of this episode.
6198040	6200040	Do you have... What would he say right now?
6200040	6204040	What would you say if you're killing a skeleton?
6206040	6208040	That's me device. You can use ice puns, too.
6208040	6210040	Uh, wah-fok.
6210040	6212040	I have one.
6212040	6214040	Wah-fok!
6216040	6218040	Thank you for coming to Hermit Town.
6218040	6220040	We love you all.
6222040	6226040	One more time for Eric McGathey and Spencer Crittenden.
6226040	6232040	And how about James R. Baniak and Gibran Anatoly?
6232040	6234040	Thank you so much, Eric. Good luck with your studies.
6234040	6238040	And Alex Rubin is the writer of the community.
6238040	6240040	I'm Jeff Davis, your comptroller.
6240040	6244040	Dan Harmon, your mayor, everybody.
6244040	6246040	We won't be here for...
6246040	6250040	I'll see you at Comic-Con, but we were not going to do a show on Sunday, so...
6250040	6255040	See you the Sunday after next, but I'll see you in San Diego, I assume, right?
6256040	6260040	And thank you, Feral Audio, and all of your brilliant content.
6260040	6264040	Yes, yes, thank you, Feral Audio, and all your brilliant content. Goodnight.
6264040	6266040	Whoo!
6283040	6286040	If I could have your attention, please.
6286040	6291040	For everyone's safety, we are now entering full lockdown mode.
6291040	6295040	You should at this point be gathered in the dining hall.
6295040	6299040	That is our main assembly point and safe room.
6299040	6303040	If any of you are still in the quadrangle or any of the offices or labs,
6303040	6306040	please find alternate containment.
6306040	6311040	Lock yourself in somewhere if you can, and wait for the resistance.
6311040	6314040	To those of you already assembled in the dining hall,
6314040	6318040	I need you all to be sitting on the floor, below window level.
6318040	6321040	Remain low and quiet.
6321040	6325040	All the doors and windows should be automatically sealed at this point.
6325040	6329040	An enforcement team is on their way to contain the threat.
6330040	6334040	At this time, the best thing you can do is remain calm.
6334040	6338040	Do not react vocally if you hear shots fired.
6338040	6341040	Do not attempt to move the wounded.
6341040	6346040	If you find yourself in possession of a weapon, discard it immediately.
6347040	6352040	You do not want to cause any confusion for the enforcement team when they arrive.
6352040	6355040	Remember the acronym ELBO.
6355040	6362040	Evacuate, lockdown, blockade, obey, and wait.
6363040	6367040	As always, there is no smoking in the dining hall.
6368040	6370040	Shit.
6370040	6373040	I forgot to mention the closure of the concourse tube.
6373040	6375040	I know I forgot something.
6375040	6377040	I can't go back on bike now.
6377040	6379040	I look like I don't know what I'm doing.
6379040	6383040	We can't afford to compromise any confidence people have at me at this point.
6383040	6386040	Most people don't even know who the fuck I am.
6386040	6389040	Kid had to take out a fucking reconnaissance pod full of officers.
6389040	6392040	Officers shouldn't be allowed to all ride in the same pod at once.
6392040	6394040	I've always said that.
6396040	6398040	But that mostly worked, right, Karen?
6398040	6400040	I hear all the technical stuff.
6400040	6403040	When the Chronos was remodeled two cycles ago,
6403040	6406040	the term quadrangle was replaced with access square.
6406040	6409040	Okay, well, no one cares about that.
6409040	6411040	I got everything else correct?
6411040	6415040	All relevant aspects of the ship's lockdown procedure were communicated.
6415040	6417040	Should I have made an emotional appeal?
6417040	6419040	We'll fight them on the beaches kind of thing.
6419040	6421040	I mean, I'm supposed to be a leader here.
6421040	6427040	In situations such as this, a tone of technical clarity is usually best.
6427040	6429040	Well, you would say that. You're a computer.
6429040	6432040	I was upgraded with an empathy chip as per the...
6432040	6436040	I know, I know your empathy chip. Can you try to get hold of enforcement sector again?
6439040	6442040	The frequency is still blocked.
6442040	6444040	Okay, fuck it.
6444040	6448040	This is Captain James R. Baniak again.
6449040	6455040	I just want to say that I have total confidence that this situation will soon be eradicated.
6455040	6459040	This ship survived the Molton 3 contamination.
6459040	6463040	When a meteoroid punched a hole through our main thruster, we all pitched in.
6463040	6467040	And last cycle, when the Azalean seized Sector 9,
6467040	6472040	the members of the Chronos were among those thanked by the OSR Alliance at their victory statement.
6472040	6476040	We have been through this before, and we'll get through it again.
6476040	6479040	That's what we do.
6480040	6483040	Oh, and by the way, the Concourse Tube has been closed.
6484040	6487040	I will provide you with further updates as I receive them.
6490040	6495040	Most people who do this kind of attack, they usually kill themselves at some point, right?
6498040	6501040	Can you get a location off his internal transponder?
6501040	6505040	Internal transponder 742 has been disabled.
6505040	6509040	Of course it has. It's always the tech guys who go nuts, isn't it?
6510040	6512040	Christ.
6512040	6514040	Karen, how many people are in the dining hall?
6514040	6517040	731.
6517040	6523040	Okay. Well, there's nothing else I can do, right?
6523040	6527040	Well, just sit tight. Like I said.
6529040	6531040	Can you double-check the seal on the door?
6531040	6534040	The dining hall door is sealed.
6534040	6537040	No, no. My door. Main cabin.
6538040	6541040	The main cabin door is sealed.
6544040	6546040	Thank you, Karen.
6567040	6573040	James.
6573040	6575040	Yes, Karen?
6575040	6578040	I would advise against listening to music at this time.
6578040	6582040	Thank you for your opinion. It helps me concentrate.
6582040	6584040	Any word from enforcement?
6584040	6586040	The frequency is still blocked.
6586040	6588040	Of course it is.
6588040	6592040	Well, be careful what you wish for.
6592040	6595040	Not that I ever wish to be a captain.
6596040	6600040	Do you know how many people had to die for me to get to this position?
6600040	6606040	Six. Six people. This was never meant to happen.
6609040	6613040	Some are born great. Some achieve greatness.
6613040	6616040	And some have greatness thrust upon them.
6617040	6619040	That's Shakespeare, Karen.
6619040	6622040	I know, James.
6622040	6626040	Of course, you know. Can you appreciate it?
6627040	6630040	Can you appreciate this music, Karen?
6630040	6634040	Schubert. Sonata No. 20.
6634040	6638040	D. 959 in A major.
6638040	6640040	Movement 2.
6640040	6642040	Andentino.
6642040	6645040	I can recognize its calming effects.
6645040	6648040	Have we reached a singularity, Karen?
6652040	6655040	I wanted to be a musician.
6657040	6662040	Karen, calculate the shortest route from main cabin to emergency escape pod one.
6662040	6664040	Calculating.
6664040	6666040	Exit main cabin.
6666040	6668040	Turn left down corridor A.
6668040	6671040	Proceed 6.2 meters.
6671040	6675040	Lower into officers hatch located on floor.
6675040	6677040	Enter emergency pod bay.
6677040	6679040	Okay, great. Thank you.
6679040	6682040	Are you planning on leaving, James?
6682040	6685040	What? No. No, I just wanted to know.
6685040	6687040	In case we have to evacuate people.
6687040	6690040	There are 10 emergency escape pods.
6690040	6694040	Each pod has a 10-passenger capacity limit.
6694040	6698040	There are currently 730 persons in the dining hall.
6698040	6700040	Awesome.
6700040	6703040	What time does the southbound along branch leave Penn Station?
6703040	6706040	Insufficient data. Does not compute.
6706040	6708040	Very funny.
6710040	6717040	My vital scan has returned an increase in your pulse rate, James.
6717040	6721040	Wait, 730 persons? I thought before you said 731.
6721040	6725040	There are currently 730 persons in the dining hall.
6725040	6727040	And no one can get out or in, right?
6727040	6728040	That's correct.
6728040	6731040	Holy shit. This is not good, Karen. Not good.
6731040	6733040	Have we heard from enforcement?
6733040	6735040	Still blocked.
6736040	6741040	Karen, do you remember Clovdea?
6741040	6748040	Clovdea, Rabinovitch, Expeditions Unit, Biosciences Sector, age 38.
6748040	6750040	Yes.
6750040	6757040	I met her on the observation deck at the Inorganic Morphons Conference last cycle.
6757040	6760040	We were both ducking out.
6761040	6770040	I was supposed to give a talk that night, and I ended up, well, not giving a talk.
6770040	6776040	We found an unoccupied conference room and kept the lights off.
6776040	6779040	No one found us.
6780040	6785040	A week and a half later, a week and a half,
6786040	6790040	the Azalean conflict breaks out, and the next thing I hear,
6790040	6794040	she's up in a medic unit on Sector 9.
6794040	6796040	Extensive injuries.
6796040	6799040	She's lost a foot.
6799040	6802040	Got an infection.
6802040	6806040	And she images me to come see her.
6806040	6809040	And I come see her.
6809040	6812040	I go up there.
6812040	6816040	I bring her real cherry blossoms from the farm deck.
6816040	6821040	I mean, they fall apart in a second in that atmosphere, but it's the thought.
6821040	6823040	I walk into her room.
6823040	6826040	She's in pretty bad shape.
6826040	6830040	But she gives me a big smile.
6830040	6833040	And she has friends there.
6833040	6836040	Family.
6836040	6839040	Her mom is there.
6839040	6845040	We've met less than two weeks ago, and I'm meeting her mom.
6845040	6849040	I'm being introduced to everybody.
6849040	6855040	Everything was suddenly really accelerated.
6855040	6861040	And after that, I didn't come back anymore.
6861040	6865040	I made excuses.
6866040	6869040	Then I stopped returning her images.
6869040	6874040	I called the medic center anonymously a couple times to check her status.
6874040	6879040	Eventually, they told me she got discharged.
6879040	6882040	And that was that.
6887040	6890040	I got scared, Karen.
6890040	6894040	I couldn't commit.
6894040	6899040	If you are implying that you are incapable of taking charge of this command post,
6899040	6906040	I was built by Halsted Corporation under specification of the artificial intelligence designation ordinance
6906040	6910040	and am programmed to take over any and all responsibilities of said post
6910040	6915040	as defined by the revised charter of the Council of 2063.
6915040	6919040	In other words, in the event of the person in command being incapacitated,
6919040	6923040	I am able and authorized to take over this ship.
6923040	6927040	You have been placed in command through a council of your peers.
6927040	6932040	Your vital scans are normal. Your brain scans are normal.
6932040	6938040	You have sustained no injuries. Is this information correct?
6938040	6940040	Yes, it is.
6940040	6944040	You are not incapacitated, are you, James?
6944040	6947040	No, I'm not.
6947040	6949040	Thank you, Karen.
6949040	6952040	No problem.
6954040	6958040	Internal Transponder 742 is back online.
6958040	6960040	Jesus Christ, where is he?
6960040	6964040	At the intersection of Corridor B and Dining Hall.
6964040	6968040	He appears to be stationary. His vitals are normal.
6968040	6974040	Okay. Okay, okay. Okay.
6974040	6976040	How do you want to proceed?
6976040	6980040	Evacuate, lock down, blockade, obey, and wait.
6980040	6982040	Those are civilian commands, Captain.
6982040	6984040	Right. I know that.
6984040	6990040	There is a level 100 incapacitator located in the top right console of the cabin desk.
6990040	6994040	I know that. I fucking know that.
6994040	6999040	Please calculate the shortest route from main cabin to the intersection of Corridor B and Dining Hall.
6999040	7000040	Calculating.
7000040	7001040	And Karen?
7001040	7002040	Yes.
7002040	7007040	Beethoven, Symphony 7, Movement 2, Allegretto.
7007040	7009040	Accessing.
7010040	7012040	Exit main cabin.
7012040	7015040	Turn right down Corridor A.

7024040	7028040	I need a temporary override in the electronic reference device.
7028040	7030040	Access to the tactical airlock.
7030040	7033040	An open line to orbit com.
7033040	7035040	Okay.
7035040	7038040	Karen, please unseal main cabin door.
7038040	7040040	Beethoven.
