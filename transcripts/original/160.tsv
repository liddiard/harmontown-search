10000	19000	Camera 6, find Callie Kazoo right there. Wave to the camera right there. That's Callie Kazoo's music right there. Harman Town is now in session!
19000	24000	Music
24000	27000	Let's bring in our Game Master, Mrs. Spencer Crichton!
27000	36000	Music
36000	41000	Oh yeah! And the Mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman!
41000	46000	Music
46000	48000	Thank you very much!
48000	50000	Applause
50000	52000	That's very kind.
52000	57000	Spencer and I almost didn't make it because we're starting at like 7.59. It's amazing.
57000	63000	I made one comment in the green room yesterday because we were starting to load in at like 8.15.
63000	66000	It was like, you know, that always happens.
66000	69000	Things gradually slip when people show up later, blah blah blah.
69000	75000	And I made one comment about it. Somebody cracked the fucking whip. I think it was Dustin.
75000	76000	Dustin Trails!
76000	82000	I didn't want it to happen. I didn't want the whip to crack. I wanted the whip to gently, like a jump rope.
82000	85000	I wanted to go to 8.14 and then 8.13.
85000	86000	Right.
86000	89000	Because I was taking a shit.
89000	94000	Now I got what the kids call a turtle head.
94000	100000	It's not true. The kids don't call it that. And I do. And it's not true also.
100000	103000	I took a huge shit at home before I came here.
103000	108000	Okay, so speaking of positive changes, just for the asking.
108000	112000	So last week we got our scoop, our ice scoop.
112000	118000	But then you may have noticed, so Bobcat Goldthwaite's up here and he's talking about child molestation
118000	123000	and I'm using the ice scoop as a cramp. It's very awkward.
123000	126000	But I'll be damned if I'm going to not drink.
126000	132000	So...
132000	135000	Are those little chicken feet? They look like little chicken feet.
135000	141000	Not only are these tongs, which is better than a scoop, but the one drawback that a tong would have under a scoop
141000	145000	would be the tongs, you don't trust them.
145000	149000	But even if just psychologically the idea that these are chicken feet tongs,
149000	153000	like I tested it backstage, it's amazing.
153000	156000	I mean you can blindly reach in and you'll come out with at least one cube.
156000	159000	And it's not going anywhere.
159000	167000	And it's quiet. It's child molestation conversation compatible to the year 2030.
167000	174000	And we got that, so to give credit where credit is due, we just got that, you know, from Brandon.
174000	176000	I don't know if he wants his whole name said.
176000	177000	Sure.
177000	180000	Brandon Lee, chill coat. Chill coat.
180000	184000	Hello, Brandon here. I enjoy Harman Town and I've heard your plea for clean ice.
184000	190000	I think he sent this before, you know, it raced and lost the scoop.
190000	192000	But it beat the scoop.
192000	197000	My girlfriend, Risa, and I hope to make it out to a show one day.
197000	202000	You don't know her, she's in Niagara Falls.
202000	206000	So please take this as a token of appreciation for less dirty and gross beverages.
206000	207000	I love it.
207000	212000	Thank you, Brandon.
212000	216000	What else do we, if we could just ask, you know, let's positively visualize.
216000	220000	Let's clean this act up. What do we want?
220000	224000	I got a very civilized gift from a guy named Nick Gill who sent this from the UK.
224000	227000	He's a playwright and author from London, I think London.
227000	231000	And he's written an adaptation of The Trial by Kafka.
231000	235000	And the first character in it, Comptroller.
235000	237000	Did you know it's pronounced controller?
237000	238000	It's pronounced controller.
238000	241000	Because we actually have one at Starburn Studios now.
241000	242000	You do?
242000	244000	Yeah, we have a, it's like a real word in a real thing.
244000	245000	Don't kick his ass, dude.
245000	247000	Yeah, well.
247000	249000	Is it sexist? It might be a girl.
249000	254000	Okay, so it could be a girl. Girls can be controllers.
254000	256000	But I feel like they pronounce it right.
256000	258000	Why would you say, why would you spell it comptroller?
258000	260000	You're going to call it controller. It irritates me.
260000	262000	I still have never looked it up. I don't know what the word means.
262000	269000	All right. So, well, okay.
269000	271000	We'll just speed through the current events.
271000	277000	Of course, a lot of people, for better or for worse, Jeff, get their news from this show.
277000	280000	I think that's for better. I think that's for better.
280000	283000	So the Pokemon shootings were averted.
283000	289000	There was a big Pokemon conference and there were two guys.
289000	291000	World champions.
291000	294000	Stop me when I'm wrong if you know what I'm wrong about the details.
294000	300000	But there were two people who tweeted that they were going to, tweeted a threat.
300000	303000	There's social media warnings about these gentlemen.
303000	307000	Oh, people on social media were warning about them because maybe they were making creepy comments or something.
307000	308000	Something along those lines.
308000	314000	At any rate, these guys get stopped before going into the convention and they search their car
314000	317000	and they have like fucking assault rifles and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.
317000	320000	Yeah, there's an assault rifle and a shotgun.
320000	327000	So, I mean, unless there's more to it, you know, I spent five seconds reading about it, but it appeared to be a giant massacre.
327000	329000	They were going to blast up the Pokemon.
329000	332000	Yeah, the world championships, Jeff.
332000	341000	And the crazy thing about the article isn't the photo of the weapons in question to me,
341000	343000	because they just look like pictures of weapons.
343000	348000	The scary thing to me is the photo of the, whether it's this year's or not,
348000	352000	but just the photo of what a Pokemon conference looks like.
352000	359000	No, and I don't, I'm not teasing, I'm saying like it's a room full, it's packed, you know, and it's just...
359000	362000	It's the world championships.
362000	365000	It's very...
365000	369000	So there's regional Pokemon things that you climb your way up to make a world championship?
369000	374000	I mean, you don't just start at the world championships.
374000	375000	There's regionals.
375000	379000	You got to be eight gym leaders.
379000	381000	That might actually be true.
381000	385000	So I've never played Pokemon. Is it like a card kind of game or...
385000	387000	Well, I mean, I didn't dig too deeply.
387000	390000	There is a card game that I believe, yeah, that's still popular.
390000	393000	And there's, you know, the video game that people play against.
393000	394000	I bought...
394000	395000	There you go.
395000	398000	That's Steve Levy.
398000	400000	Oh, he's here. He's in the research department, Steve.
400000	402000	He loves Pokemon.
402000	406000	I bought a Nintendo thing, the DS thing in New York,
406000	410000	and I wanted to get into Pokemon because it seems like, because you got to catch them all.
410000	411000	Yeah.
411000	413000	From what I understand.
413000	417000	And that appeals to my, you know, I like the hoarding and the, you know,
417000	420000	I thought if you improve them and trade them and have them fight each other,
420000	422000	like from what I've heard about Pokemon for 25 years...
422000	426000	It sounds like a very unsafe thing to get into now.
426000	427000	Yeah.
427000	430000	Or the most safe ever now for the time being.
430000	435000	But the scary thing about it was what a murder spree friendly environment.
435000	436000	I mean, I just...
436000	437000	Children.
437000	438000	What's that?
438000	439000	It's cockfighting for children.
439000	442000	Oh, well, the game is cockfighting for children, yes.
442000	448000	But I had moved back to the much more severe topic of those children getting shot in the face.
448000	449000	So, all right.
449000	454000	So the Pokemon shootings were averted, which makes it okay to now go back to police bashing
454000	457000	because they really did their job there, obviously.
457000	461000	Law enforcement at work at the Pokemon conference.
461000	466000	Law enforcement a little less at work at LAX where Wiz Khalifa was handcuffed
466000	467000	and slammed to the floor.
467000	468000	He wasn't resisting.
468000	469000	He wasn't resisting.
469000	475000	Well, then why did they keep saying stop resisting?
475000	479000	Why would police say that while kneeling on your back if they couldn't tell,
479000	482000	like a chiropractor can, that there's resistance going on?
482000	483000	They can tell.
483000	485000	Their knees are right on his shoulder blades.
485000	486000	They know if there's resistance there.
486000	487000	You got me there.
487000	491000	But this guy, I was like, who's Wiz Khalifa?
491000	493000	And I was all excited because listen to his name.
493000	495000	It's like, it's more than just a rapper.
495000	498000	It's like, wow, I'm into a guy named Wiz Khalifa.
498000	501000	Like, he's super, super duper not white.
501000	506000	Like, he's covered in tattoos and he's the...
506000	511000	Were you watching that twin show with us on VH1, that twin reality show thing?
511000	516000	Anyways, the two white fat twins, the funniest thing was that they won
516000	518000	because their song was We Dem Boys.
518000	520000	And that's Wiz Khalifa.
520000	521000	I didn't connect those dots.
521000	526000	We Dem Boys and the song from Fast Furious.
526000	531000	When you put in your booty and you put on your face
531000	536000	And it's good to have seen you but I'll see you again
536000	539000	Yo, yo, yo, it seems like back in the day
539000	543000	It seems like back in the times and all the usual ways from around
543000	547000	It's one of those heartfelt kind of back in the day raps
547000	550000	It doesn't have to be as good a rap
550000	552000	I was getting that vibe from that
552000	554000	I always wanted to do...
554000	556000	It's like the quintessential one of those
556000	557000	But those come out every eight years
557000	561000	It started off with kind of like a Michael McDonald kind of dooby brothers kind of thing
561000	564000	Yeah, can you do one?
564000	566000	Can you sing with your dulcet tones?
566000	569000	And then so I can do a back in the day like rap
569000	573000	So what do I have to accomplish with my part of it?
573000	574000	You have to do like the hook
574000	575000	You have to be like the...
575000	577000	You have to do like a...
577000	578000	You have to say like
578000	582000	I love your face and I love your chicken too
582000	585000	Whatever, like a kind of like...
585000	587000	Is it about love or is it about growing?
587000	588000	It's about love
588000	590000	Or about missing people or...
590000	595000	I love your face and your chicken too
595000	598000	Give that chicken to me
598000	601000	Yeah, yeah, it seems like back in the day
605000	607000	Are we recording this?
607000	608000	Tell me we're recording this
608000	610000	Justin, are we rolling?
612000	614000	Yeah, it seems like just the other day
614000	616000	Used to be so many ways in a different way
616000	618000	Used to be in the past
618000	621000	But now things have changed so much in the usual way
622000	625000	I think we got something good here
625000	627000	You know what it is, Jeff?
627000	628000	Too many...
628000	629000	Okay, this...
629000	631000	Okay, phones tripping out
631000	635000	Oh no, I activated that thing for blind people
635000	636000	Yeah, I was like
636000	637000	How do you turn that...
637000	638000	Your iPhone's so big
638000	640000	Triple finger double tap
640000	641000	Triple finger double tap
641000	643000	To two in the pink or...
645000	648000	It's one on the app and two in the crap
649000	651000	Now I'm just adding appointments
651000	653000	I'm adding appointments everywhere
653000	655000	I have nine chiropractor appointments
655000	657000	Grandpa, put it down
657000	659000	This is a serious problem
659000	661000	Zoom out, okay
661000	662000	Hit the home button
662000	664000	He got it, he got it
664000	667000	I eventually hit the screen so much that it went into some kind of like
667000	670000	This isn't a chimp's cage mode
670000	673000	And it brought up a menu that a chimp could understand
673000	674000	The top thing was like
674000	677000	Zoom out, return to your banana
678000	680000	All right, so anyways
680000	683000	Well, so Wiz Khalifa is my new hero
683000	687000	Because he was in LAX and he wouldn't get off of his hoverboard
687000	689000	You rode one of those hoverboards
689000	690000	I've not
690000	691000	I'm always around them
691000	693000	We're at the drawing room after the show and we're drinking
693000	695000	And it seems like a terrible idea to get on one of those drunk
695000	698000	I've seen some people wipe the fuck out on those
698000	701000	Oh, you're talking about those mini Segway things
701000	702000	Yeah, those...
702000	703000	What do you call those?
703000	705000	Yeah, it's a Segway without a handle
706000	708000	Wiz Khalifa loves them
708000	709000	And he loves it so much
709000	711000	He was riding around LAX with them
711000	712000	And the cops were like
712000	713000	You gotta stop that
713000	714000	And he's like
714000	715000	Why?
715000	716000	No, I don't
716000	717000	And they're like
717000	718000	Yeah, you do
718000	719000	And he's like
719000	720000	What are you gonna arrest me for not doing what you say?
720000	721000	That's awesome
721000	722000	Good question
722000	723000	That's not against the law
723000	724000	Fucking cops are
724000	725000	What are you, a judge?
725000	726000	Like there's no
726000	727000	What's the law?
727000	728000	No hoverboard law?
728000	729000	You can't go skateboarding around LAX
729000	732000	They drive little trucks all around the fucking LAX
732000	734000	Yeah, and if you've ever been to another airport
734000	735000	Down the hallways?
735000	736000	Like in international airports
736000	740000	Like Japanese businessmen
740000	741000	They ride fucking...
741000	742000	They have like scooters
742000	743000	They inspect your gadgets
743000	744000	Roller skate shoes
744000	746000	And they have like crazy
746000	748000	Like their luggage turns into a fucking like
748000	751000	Like a fucking wave runner
753000	754000	You're like
754000	755000	What the fuck?
755000	756000	Am I in trouble?
756000	757000	Is that Al-Qaeda?
757000	758000	And they're like
758000	759000	No, that's a Japanese guy
759000	760000	He knows what he's doing
761000	762000	These are the passengers
762000	763000	This is not
763000	764000	These are the passengers
764000	765000	What the fuck?
765000	766000	Yeah
766000	767000	I want to do that
767000	768000	So here's the thing about airports
768000	769000	Here's the thing about the TSA
769000	770000	Here's the thing about our panic
770000	772000	Here's the thing about going into these places
772000	773000	And the religion being
773000	776000	Don't do anything weird
776000	777000	Don't do anything wrong
777000	778000	I just want to say about that
778000	780000	Like we keep falling back on this hot button of like
780000	781000	Oh it must be so hard
781000	782000	And there's so many things at stake
782000	784000	Meanwhile as we all learned
784000	785000	For ten years
785000	787000	We were worshipping at this altar
787000	789000	And you know
789000	790000	Fine
790000	791000	Like we were doing it for nothing
791000	793000	Because you could have had a gun in your hat
793000	796000	Like and 95% of them would have gotten through
796000	798000	Like they tested it
798000	799000	And there's still
799000	801000	So forget about that for a second
801000	803000	Just observe the fact that like
803000	804000	It's a checkpoint
804000	805000	It's a security checkpoint
805000	808000	You know what's a really bad idea for security checkpoints?
808000	810000	Like disruptability
810000	813000	Do you know what all there is at that place?
813000	815000	It's fucking ways that they tell you
815000	816000	You can disrupt them
816000	818000	Like they're advertising about it
818000	819000	It's like
819000	821000	Don't make the wrong comment
821000	822000	Don't make the wrong joke
822000	825000	Don't you motherfuckers have shit under control?
825000	826000	Because if you do
826000	828000	I should be able to make a joke
828000	829000	Everyone should be able to
829000	831000	I should be able to run into an airport
831000	835000	With seven prop like
835000	837000	Dynamite vests
837000	840000	Unlike one of those Michael Jackson Venice Beach things
840000	841000	And be like
841000	844000	Six of me are terrorists
844000	845000	And they should be like
845000	848000	Knock it off sir
848000	852000	That's too big for the luggage rack
852000	853000	I bought extra seats
853000	854000	And it's like
854000	855000	But you know
855000	856000	In the end if I
856000	857000	You know if it's not
857000	858000	If the dogs don't bark
858000	861000	Or if I don't get a gray swab reading or what
861000	862000	Have your draconian rules
862000	863000	I did something
863000	865000	The last trip I took
865000	866000	I guess when we were going to
866000	868000	New York for Harmontown out there
868000	870000	I went into LAX and
870000	871000	They said
871000	872000	Sir, randomly
872000	874000	Can you put your palm out?
874000	875000	They did like the
875000	876000	You know the explosive residue test
876000	877000	With a little
877000	879000	Ravioli looking with pieces of cloth
879000	880000	They do look like ravioli
880000	881000	Yeah they do
881000	882000	What
882000	883000	Why is that?
883000	884000	I don't know
884000	885000	Why does ravioli have to look like
885000	887000	Like have those little teeth
887000	888000	I think that's how you kind of
888000	889000	Crimp them together
889000	890000	You close them up that way
890000	891000	Like you take a fork
891000	892000	And you crimp them
892000	893000	That's the fastening system
893000	895000	To keep a ravioli together man
895000	896000	But then I wonder why
896000	898000	That little swatch has to have it
898000	900000	Because patches have those too
900000	901000	Yeah
901000	902000	Well that's like
902000	903000	What are those
903000	904000	Pinking shoes
904000	905000	What's the ones
905000	906000	The zig zaggy ones right
906000	907000	You know at the end
907000	908000	Maybe they don't want those to fray
908000	909000	I guess not
909000	910000	They probably don't
910000	911000	Please continue your story
911000	912000	Thank you dad
912000	915000	Hey this story is full of all kinds of Easter eggs
915000	916000	We can explore if you want
916000	918000	And by the way if you're not enjoying the show
918000	919000	This is all bonus content
919000	920000	This is usually when we start
924000	925000	That was the cold open
928000	929000	So um
929000	930000	Instantly
930000	931000	Air air air
931000	932000	Like the alarms go off
934000	935000	I love your face
936000	937000	Send your chick into
940000	941000	So um
941000	943000	It kind of goes red alert
943000	944000	These two guys
944000	945000	Instantly
945000	946000	Like one guy looks up and goes
946000	947000	What's going on
947000	948000	The guy gets like
948000	949000	It's beeping
949000	950000	He's like
950000	951000	He's like
951000	952000	This doesn't happen
952000	953000	And I'm like
953000	954000	Uh oh
954000	955000	And the other guy comes over
955000	956000	And he's like
956000	957000	What do you mean it's beeping
957000	958000	He's like
958000	959000	If the thing is beeped
959000	960000	I put it on his hand
960000	961000	And it beeped
961000	962000	And he's like
962000	963000	Okay sir
963000	964000	You have to come with us
964000	965000	And so they walked me
965000	966000	Through the shit
966000	967000	Through security
967000	968000	Put it on a bell
968000	969000	So I go
969000	970000	Like
970000	971000	Front of the line
972000	973000	Okay they're going to find out
973000	974000	A secondary thing
974000	975000	That I don't
975000	976000	That I didn't make a bomb today
976000	977000	And I'm going to go
977000	980000	Meanwhile guess how many fucking bombs can get through
980000	981000	While that's happening
981000	982000	Yeah loads
982000	983000	Anyways
983000	984000	So
984000	987000	So I guess they open up everything
987000	988000	All my stuff
988000	989000	And take everything out
989000	991000	And they wipe everything down
991000	992000	With another little ravioli
992000	993000	I don't know how many raviolis
993000	994000	They went through on this
995000	997000	But you could have had a lovely Italian meal then
1000000	1001000	Uh
1001000	1002000	Get a nice sauce
1002000	1003000	So uh
1003000	1004000	So they
1004000	1005000	Then they take me into the
1005000	1006000	The sanctum sanctorum
1006000	1007000	This little
1007000	1008000	This little private room
1008000	1009000	They go
1009000	1010000	We're going to take you in this room
1010000	1012000	And we're going to have to give you a full search
1012000	1013000	A full pat down
1013000	1014000	And I'm like
1014000	1015000	Okay
1015000	1016000	And they go
1016000	1018000	But there's going to be two of us in the room
1018000	1019000	I'm like
1019000	1020000	Okay tell me why
1020000	1021000	Because it's so someone is watching
1021000	1022000	To make sure that nothing
1022000	1023000	He knows whatever
1023000	1025000	But they both really got in there man
1025000	1026000	They were like
1026000	1027000	They were like
1027000	1028000	I'm going to be touching you like
1028000	1029000	Right on your
1029000	1030000	On your situation
1030000	1031000	And like
1031000	1032000	He was
1032000	1033000	It was fucking romantic
1033000	1034000	I'm like
1034000	1036000	You guys do work here
1036000	1037000	I was like
1037000	1038000	This is
1038000	1039000	This is
1039000	1040000	It was so hard not to crack a joke in there
1040000	1041000	I was like
1041000	1042000	I was just like
1042000	1043000	Wow
1043000	1044000	What you can't do
1044000	1045000	Because that's how they get you
1045000	1046000	Yeah exactly
1046000	1047000	That's how El Cada will slip up
1047000	1049000	They'll make a funny funny joke
1049000	1051000	Like like like
1051000	1052000	They'll be like
1052000	1053000	They'll be like
1053000	1054000	Whoa
1054000	1055000	Knock knock
1055000	1056000	Who's there?
1056000	1057000	Kaboom boom
1057000	1058000	It's like
1058000	1064000	Okay you're being awfully chipper about this whole thing
1064000	1065000	Step over there
1065000	1066000	This isn't
1066000	1067000	We're not profiling sir
1067000	1068000	Except for
1068000	1069000	Just based on your word play
1069000	1070000	Yeah
1070000	1073000	Yeah so
1073000	1075000	I don't want to say he lingered on my dick
1075000	1076000	But it certainly
1076000	1078000	It wasn't cursory
1078000	1079000	It was
1079000	1080000	It was
1080000	1081000	It was thorough
1081000	1082000	We got to third base I think
1082000	1083000	And if you were
1083000	1084000	If you were
1084000	1085000	If you were told
1085000	1086000	And I don't think
1086000	1089000	I don't think the guy was like hoverboarding
1089000	1091000	Through the x-ray machine
1091000	1093000	Toward the cockpit
1093000	1094000	I think
1094000	1096000	I think he was probably literally
1096000	1097000	I'm gonna guess
1097000	1098000	If I know Wiz Khalifa
1098000	1099000	He was going to
1099000	1102000	I'm pretty sure he was probably in ticketing
1102000	1104000	You know he was probably hovering
1104000	1105000	At the kiosk
1105000	1107000	Where you get yourself checked in
1107000	1108000	Yeah
1108000	1109000	And he was probably like
1109000	1110000	I love
1111000	1112000	Cause he really
1112000	1114000	Cause the two things I really like about this guy
1114000	1115000	27 years old
1115000	1116000	Covered in tattoos
1116000	1117000	Looking at him
1117000	1119000	He's the old white man's
1119000	1120000	Worst nightmare
1120000	1123000	You definitely want him off your lawn
1123000	1124000	Before anybody else
1124000	1126000	But very
1126000	1127000	Very soft
1127000	1128000	Turns out
1128000	1129000	Very soft spoken
1129000	1130000	And very
1130000	1131000	He's Henry David Thoreau
1131000	1134000	He acted in total civil disobedience
1134000	1135000	He's just like
1135000	1137000	No I don't want to get off my hoverboard
1137000	1138000	I don't understand
1138000	1139000	What's happening
1139000	1140000	Am I being arrested or detained?
1140000	1141000	And then you know
1141000	1142000	And they slam him to the floor
1142000	1143000	And they're just like
1143000	1144000	Stop resisting
1144000	1145000	That weird voice they use
1145000	1146000	They sound like lizards
1146000	1148000	Stop resisting
1148000	1150000	Stop resisting
1150000	1151000	And he just keeps going
1151000	1152000	I'm not resisting sir
1152000	1153000	I'm not resisting sir
1153000	1156000	Like he's probably done it a thousand times
1156000	1158000	And he was tweeting about the whole thing
1158000	1159000	I'm gonna guess with that
1159000	1160000	I've pet peeve of mine
1160000	1163000	Police insist on calling everything a vehicle
1163000	1164000	Just say car
1164000	1165000	Yeah
1165000	1166000	Get out of the vehicle sir
1166000	1167000	Get out of the vehicle
1167000	1168000	Jeff what you have to understand
1168000	1169000	That at this point in time
1169000	1170000	That they have to speak longer
1170000	1171000	So that they can take longer
1171000	1172000	To figure out what it is
1172000	1173000	That they're trying to say
1173000	1174000	At this particular juncture
1174000	1175000	Yeah
1175000	1176000	So they figured out
1176000	1177000	There's like
1177000	1178000	What's styrofoam words
1178000	1179000	Like cause they can't go
1179000	1180000	Uh
1180000	1181000	Uh
1181000	1182000	Uh
1182000	1183000	Uh
1183000	1184000	Uh
1184000	1185000	Bad driving
1185000	1186000	Uh
1186000	1187000	Uh
1187000	1188000	Uh
1188000	1189000	Uh
1189000	1190000	Uh
1190000	1191000	Uh
1191000	1192000	Uh
1192000	1193000	Uh
1193000	1194000	Uh
1194000	1195000	Uh
1195000	1196000	Uh
1196000	1197000	Bad driving
1198000	1199000	Uh
1199000	1200000	Uh
1200000	1201000	To then walk into the public with a gun
1201000	1202000	Um
1202000	1203000	During that six weeks
1203000	1204000	They tell you
1204000	1205000	Uh
1205000	1206000	These people are animals
1206000	1207000	And you have to
1207000	1208000	Uh
1208000	1210000	You have to hold a chair in front of you
1210000	1212000	But you're not allowed to hold a chair
1212000	1213000	Because of these fucking lawyers
1213000	1214000	Um
1214000	1216000	So your chair has to be your attitude
1216000	1217000	You know you have to
1217000	1218000	Because if you turn your fucking
1218000	1221000	Jesus fucking people will just rip your skin off
1221000	1222000	And wear it like a fucking hat
1222000	1225000	You know they're just waiting
1225000	1226000	They're just waiting
1226000	1228000	Oh they'd love it if you didn't show up for work tomorrow
1228000	1229000	They would just
1229000	1230000	Oh they'd eat all the ice cream
1230000	1234000	They'd be hoverboarding everywhere
1234000	1235000	They'd never stop hovering
1235000	1237000	And among the
1237000	1240000	Among the many hilarious things that
1240000	1241000	Mr. Khalifa pointed out
1241000	1243000	Or I call him whiz
1243000	1244000	Because I feel like we're friends
1244000	1246000	Is that
1246000	1249000	In two years the cops are going to be riding these things all over
1249000	1250000	That's what
1250000	1251000	This is going to be their new thing
1251000	1252000	There's going to be hover cops
1252000	1254000	Fucking like whizzing around
1254000	1257000	And he said it'll probably be one that I designed
1257000	1258000	Um
1258000	1259000	Which that was weird
1259000	1260000	But then I thought
1260000	1261000	You know what
1261000	1262000	He's probably a stockholder of the fucking hoverboards
1262000	1263000	Now he's even more my hero
1263000	1265000	He's a fucking marketing genius
1265000	1266000	Yeah
1266000	1267000	He probably paid the cops
1267000	1268000	Oh you think that was
1268000	1269000	See now was it just a big
1269000	1270000	Just a big commercial stunt
1270000	1271000	If it was
1271000	1272000	It's the kind of commercial I approve of
1272000	1275000	Uh
1275000	1276000	But anyways I like him
1276000	1278000	Let's invite him on the show
1278000	1279000	Well I tweeted at him
1279000	1281000	So usually that ends with people coming on the show right
1282000	1284000	I tweeted at him
1284000	1287000	I saw you facing the news
1287000	1290000	And your hoverboard problems
1292000	1294000	I didn't say blues
1294000	1297000	Cause I didn't want to do an on the nose rhyme
1297000	1299000	And I know this isn't you
1299000	1302000	Singing in that song from Fast and Furious
1302000	1305000	But the next part
1305000	1308000	Is probably you
1308000	1309000	Yo
1309000	1310000	Yo
1310000	1311000	It seems like back in the day
1311000	1312000	You were at LAX
1312000	1313000	In the usual passenger way
1313000	1314000	You tried to hoverboard your way
1314000	1315000	Through the usual way
1315000	1316000	But the cops and the cops
1316000	1317000	And the hoppers
1317000	1318000	And the hoppers
1318000	1319000	And the hoppers
1319000	1320000	My lob-a-dops
1320000	1321000	Um
1321000	1323000	And when you come on our show
1323000	1324000	That's amazing
1324000	1326000	Those lyrics are as true today
1326000	1328000	As the day they are written
1328000	1330000	People will be talking about
1330000	1331000	So talk about
1331000	1332000	How about going out
1332000	1333000	I can't do it
1333000	1334000	Lots of things are happening
1334000	1335000	In various ways
1335000	1337000	Alright so they're panicking about
1337000	1339000	Well this is from our international
1339000	1340000	Correspondent
1340000	1343000	Irish Erin McGathey
1343000	1346000	She's texting with her today
1346000	1347000	We only have like a little window
1347000	1350000	Cause of the time difference
1350000	1352000	So we try to pack a lot of communication in
1352000	1353000	But she's
1353000	1356000	The Irish are actually a little bit concerned
1356000	1357000	About Donald Trump
1357000	1358000	They think he's going to win
1358000	1359000	And they're
1359000	1361000	They're like asking her
1361000	1362000	Because she's the American ambassador
1362000	1363000	They're like
1363000	1364000	He's not going to win is he?
1364000	1366000	It's going to make people with red hair
1366000	1367000	Look bad all around the world
1367000	1368000	That's what they're scared about
1369000	1371000	And I told her
1371000	1372000	I said tell them
1372000	1373000	That the media has been
1373000	1375000	More globalized over the last couple years
1375000	1377000	So everything seems to be happening
1377000	1379000	Sooner and more sincerely
1379000	1380000	But this is
1380000	1382000	This is usual year from the election
1382000	1383000	Pre-circus
1383000	1384000	I mean
1384000	1386000	We lucked out with this guy
1386000	1387000	He's fucking amazing
1387000	1388000	Like
1388000	1389000	But
1389000	1390000	You know
1390000	1392000	If you step back and look at it
1392000	1394000	As the Republicans and Democrats
1394000	1395000	Functioning as one organization
1395000	1396000	Which they literally do
1396000	1398000	And that does not mean that healthcare
1398000	1400000	And all the issues that they break down microcosmically
1400000	1402000	Are not important to human beings
1402000	1403000	I'm just saying like
1403000	1405000	These guys literally are
1405000	1406000	A single
1406000	1408000	Call it a corporation
1408000	1409000	They run the debates
1409000	1410000	They run the election
1410000	1411000	An argument could be made
1411000	1414000	That they completely marginalize
1414000	1416000	The entire spectrum of political thought
1416000	1417000	Around the planet
1417000	1419000	Because everybody has followed suit
1419000	1421000	With this weird duopoly dichotomy
1421000	1423000	Of elephants and donkeys
1423000	1424000	I just call them
1424000	1425000	Bananas
1425000	1428000	And cantaloupes in Bavaria
1428000	1429000	I don't know what to
1429000	1430000	Oh
1430000	1431000	Oh
1431000	1432000	The pudding party
1432000	1433000	There they go again
1433000	1434000	And it's like
1434000	1435000	I think you learn this from us
1435000	1437000	This Coke Pepsi thing that evolves
1437000	1439000	If your empire is perfectly comfortable
1439000	1441000	And it just turns into this
1441000	1442000	Kind of like
1442000	1443000	Just standard
1443000	1445000	Kind of like
1445000	1446000	Well
1446000	1447000	You know
1447000	1448000	We don't really want to change anything
1448000	1450000	But here's our two moods
1450000	1451000	You know
1451000	1453000	We want everybody to be happy
1453000	1455000	We're not going to do anything about it
1455000	1457000	So let's run those two thoughts
1457000	1458000	Against each other
1458000	1459000	And we kind of
1459000	1461000	And the good news about that is
1461000	1462000	It's Trump proof
1462000	1463000	Like he's not going to get elected
1463000	1464000	Like these people
1464000	1465000	They wouldn't let
1465000	1467000	They wouldn't let a third party
1467000	1470000	Like come near the possibility
1470000	1471000	Before that happens
1471000	1473000	Like Seattle will explode
1473000	1475000	Like when Trump's in it
1475000	1476000	And then people will be like
1476000	1477000	I don't know
1477000	1478000	It was a weird
1478000	1480000	It was a coffee explosion
1480000	1482000	It's part of global warming
1482000	1484000	The city blew up and so Trump's dead
1486000	1488000	I mean they don't have to do that though
1488000	1490000	I think it's going to have to get pretty sloppy
1490000	1492000	Before this is all done in
1492000	1494000	But that's why they're giving him a year
1494000	1495000	Like that's what it's all about
1495000	1496000	This is a ritualistic murder
1496000	1498000	Of a guy who's an unauthorized
1498000	1500000	I think it's sad that he functions as
1500000	1502000	That he registers as anything
1502000	1503000	All this guy is is a friend of your dad's
1503000	1504000	Like he's not even
1506000	1508000	Bernie Sanders should be the one that's like
1508000	1510000	Raising a stink and he is
1510000	1511000	But he's like
1512000	1514000	But people are so into
1514000	1517000	And yeah his hair is very interesting
1517000	1519000	And he does say things like
1519000	1521000	On The View
1521000	1522000	When he was talking
1522000	1523000	This is an old quote
1523000	1524000	But now people are like
1524000	1527000	People are so concerned that Donald Trump is going to win
1527000	1529000	That they're really coming at him
1529000	1531000	Like in a kind of like
1531000	1532000	He's the anti-Christ
1532000	1534000	Like as if he hasn't been
1534000	1536000	As Spencer said today at dinner
1536000	1540000	I feel like Donald Trump's been running for president for 30 years
1541000	1543000	And it's just now getting traction
1543000	1544000	And he has though, right?
1544000	1545000	That's all he's ever been doing
1545000	1546000	Is going like
1546000	1547000	I'll tell you what I would do
1547000	1548000	And I'll tell you why I'll do it
1548000	1549000	I would put me in charge
1549000	1550000	And here's why
1550000	1551000	My air conditioning works
1551000	1552000	I'll go in, go in, go in
1554000	1556000	And now all of a sudden it's just
1556000	1560000	This particularly boring election
1560000	1561000	And like who cares
1561000	1562000	But anyways
1564000	1565000	I forgot what I was going to say
1565000	1566000	The View
1566000	1567000	Oh he said on The View like a couple of years ago
1567000	1568000	Aaron sent me this quote
1568000	1569000	He said
1569000	1570000	Because he was talking
1570000	1572000	They were asking him about his daughter Ivanka
1572000	1573000	Being in Playboy
1573000	1575000	Or whether she would be in Playboy
1575000	1576000	And he said
1576000	1577000	I don't think
1577000	1579000	Now quotes suck like he quoted
1579000	1580000	You're quoted in a context
1580000	1582000	I'm sure he was very charming and self-effacing about this
1586000	1588000	But the fact of the matter is
1588000	1589000	What he said was
1589000	1592000	And I don't think my daughter Ivanka
1592000	1594000	I don't think she would do that
1594000	1596000	In reference to her posing for Playboy
1596000	1598000	Although she does have a very nice figure
1598000	1599000	That I've said
1599000	1600000	If Ivanka weren't my daughter
1600000	1601000	Perhaps I'd be dating her
1601000	1602000	Whoa
1604000	1606000	Just to split this hair
1606000	1607000	No I know you
1607000	1609000	The weird thing about this is
1609000	1610000	Like
1610000	1611000	What is it?
1611000	1612000	I immediately
1612000	1614000	That reaction in a cartoon
1614000	1615000	We would look out and the whole audience
1615000	1617000	Wouldn't have Trump hair all of a sudden
1618000	1620000	I'll tell you the two parts of that joke
1620000	1622000	That are fun to analyze
1622000	1624000	Because I can picture myself
1624000	1627000	I like the gross incest and pedophile part
1628000	1630000	I can picture myself putting my foot in that same mouth
1630000	1631000	Like if I had a daughter
1631000	1633000	And someone brought that up to me
1633000	1635000	But the things are
1635000	1637000	The word figure
1637000	1638000	Is weird
1639000	1640000	Because it evokes actual
1640000	1642000	Her actual physical tissue
1642000	1644000	Like it's not like saying she's pretty
1644000	1645000	Or she
1645000	1646000	You know
1646000	1647000	He's talking about tits and ass
1647000	1648000	Yeah it's like
1648000	1649000	She has a nice figure
1649000	1651000	Like her boobs look good
1651000	1653000	Like her ass looks like
1653000	1655000	Something you would want to touch
1655000	1657000	Is in that word figure
1657000	1658000	And then
1658000	1659000	And then the real
1659000	1660000	The real murderer is
1660000	1661000	Uh
1661000	1662000	I've said
1662000	1663000	Like he's quoting himself
1663000	1664000	He's not
1664000	1665000	He's not putting his foot in his mouth
1665000	1666000	Yeah
1666000	1667000	He's taking his foot out of his mouth
1667000	1668000	And going
1668000	1669000	You know what I always say
1669000	1672000	A daughter fuck a day keeps his doctor alive
1673000	1674000	And you know what
1674000	1676000	You're gonna read me misquoted on that
1676000	1677000	In previous things
1677000	1678000	And I'm setting the record straight
1678000	1679000	I got a hot daughter
1679000	1680000	And uh
1680000	1681000	She's good to go
1681000	1682000	I got bumper stickers
1682000	1683000	I got
1683000	1684000	I've got posters
1684000	1686000	I'm very very candid about this
1686000	1687000	I've said
1687000	1688000	I want to be
1688000	1690000	Do some people think I didn't say this?
1690000	1691000	Because it's not
1691000	1693000	Because it's not newsworthy
1693000	1694000	Well I'm telling you
1694000	1695000	My daughter's hot
1695000	1696000	I've said it
1696000	1697000	Also
1697000	1698000	Here's a
1698000	1699000	The extra little like
1699000	1700000	Like
1700000	1701000	Cherry and
1701000	1702000	Peanut sprinkler
1702000	1703000	On top of that
1703000	1704000	Gross sundae
1704000	1705000	Is
1705000	1706000	The idea that
1706000	1707000	Okay let's say you weren't
1707000	1708000	She weren't your daughter
1708000	1709000	And
1709000	1710000	But the presumption being
1710000	1711000	That this hot woman
1711000	1712000	Would date you
1712000	1713000	Like well we'd be dating
1713000	1714000	Like it'd be in the bag
1714000	1716000	Well this is where I'll split the semantic hair
1716000	1718000	If Donald Trump were
1718000	1719000	A guest on this show
1719000	1720000	Hope hope hope
1720000	1721000	Um
1721000	1722000	Fuck
1722000	1723000	Or
1723000	1724000	Or
1724000	1725000	Or of anybody
1725000	1727000	That chose to take that side
1727000	1728000	For whatever reason
1728000	1729000	In other words
1729000	1730000	To be the devil's advocate
1730000	1731000	Like
1731000	1732000	But
1732000	1733000	It's not
1733000	1734000	There's not another side to the issue
1734000	1735000	But there is just the mitigating factor
1735000	1736000	That I realized
1736000	1737000	When I was reading
1737000	1738000	More about that quote
1738000	1739000	Because I thought it might just be
1739000	1740000	A fabricated quote
1740000	1741000	That somebody just made up
1741000	1742000	Because it's kind of believable
1742000	1744000	But also unbelievable to say
1744000	1745000	Anyways
1745000	1746000	He said it on the view
1746000	1748000	And you read the larger context
1748000	1749000	And you're kind of like
1749000	1750000	Alright
1750000	1751000	He's
1751000	1752000	He's
1752000	1753000	In his mind
1753000	1754000	His bit is that
1754000	1756000	He's often lampooned
1756000	1758000	For dating young women
1758000	1759000	That
1759000	1760000	It's like
1760000	1761000	You know me
1761000	1762000	Old young fucker
1762000	1764000	It's funny because
1764000	1766000	All the fucking I do with young women
1766000	1768000	It's to the point where
1768000	1770000	The young women I make by fucking
1770000	1771000	I'd fuck them
1771000	1773000	And I'd have to do it
1773000	1774000	I'd have to do it
1774000	1775000	Yeah
1775000	1776000	I know
1776000	1777000	I know
1777000	1778000	Dean Martin drinks
1778000	1779000	And I'd
1779000	1780000	I'd do that
1780000	1781000	Hahaha
1781000	1782000	Ahh
1782000	1783000	In his mind
1783000	1784000	He's like
1784000	1786000	That's my gimmick forgiveness
1786000	1787000	I'm giving myself the razz
1787000	1788000	Lately
1788000	1789000	I'm
1789000	1791000	Because he's talking to the
1791000	1792000	View women
1792000	1793000	He's like
1793000	1794000	I know ladies
1794000	1795000	Before you even
1795000	1796000	Talk
1796000	1797000	Before you even
1797000	1798000	Start lampooning me
1798000	1799000	For the
1799000	1800000	My weaknesses
1800000	1802000	I do fuck a lot of young women
1802000	1803000	My daughter's very beautiful
1803000	1804000	So the dot
1804000	1805000	Is easy to connect there
1805000	1806000	That if she weren't my daughter
1806000	1808000	She'd probably be one of the women I fucked
1808000	1809000	Hahaha
1809000	1810000	Because of
1810000	1811000	Because of my flaws
1811000	1812000	Hahaha
1812000	1813000	Hahaha
1813000	1814000	Hahaha
1814000	1816000	Alright well it's good to give equal time to Donald Trump
1816000	1817000	He hasn't been in the
1817000	1818000	In the media a lot
1818000	1819000	So
1819000	1820000	That's a beauty about podcasting
1820000	1821000	As you get to
1821000	1822000	You get to hear things
1822000	1823000	That you wouldn't hear
1823000	1824000	Uh uh uh
1824000	1825000	Uh uh
1825000	1826000	Other places
1826000	1827000	Um
1827000	1828000	Alright there's
1828000	1829000	The raccoon is back
1829000	1830000	It's dog food
1830000	1831000	But I think I've dealt with that
1831000	1832000	By closing the uh
1832000	1833000	Same raccoon you think?
1833000	1834000	Oh I don't know about that
1834000	1835000	I think they multiple
1835000	1836000	I don't know
1836000	1839000	I mean you just know recognizable features on this raccoon
1839000	1840000	No God
1840000	1841000	Oh yeah like a bandit mask
1841000	1842000	And opposable thumbs
1842000	1843000	No no no no
1843000	1844000	I
1844000	1845000	I literally haven't seen it
1845000	1846000	But I've seen its paw prints
1846000	1847000	In the water
1847000	1848000	Around the spilled water dish
1848000	1849000	Like Harvey has to like
1849000	1850000	Hold vigil
1850000	1851000	And like
1851000	1852000	He goes and barks at it
1852000	1853000	And then I see the paw prints
1853000	1854000	So then I started closing the doggy door
1854000	1855000	After a certain time
1855000	1856000	If I close it too early
1856000	1858000	Nigel will piss on the floor
1859000	1861000	Harvey just got me right on the shoe the other day
1861000	1862000	I came in the door
1862000	1864000	He rolled over on his back
1864000	1865000	And I started petting his belly
1865000	1866000	And there's a little
1866000	1867000	Rainbow of pee
1867000	1868000	Right on my shoe
1868000	1871000	That I'm hoping is his steroid medication
1871000	1872000	For his ear infection
1872000	1874000	Which maybe was still weakening his bladder
1874000	1875000	Or something
1875000	1876000	I hope
1876000	1877000	I hope he's not
1877000	1878000	I hope it's not
1878000	1879000	And I don't even want to
1879000	1881000	I don't even want to say what I hope it's not
1881000	1882000	Because then
1882000	1883000	If Erin's listening
1883000	1884000	Because she's
1884000	1885000	I hope it's not
1885000	1886000	I hope it's not
1886000	1887000	I hope it's not like
1887000	1888000	Erin being gone
1890000	1891000	I could be
1893000	1894000	I mean
1894000	1895000	It's the
1895000	1896000	Occam's razor
1896000	1897000	Because
1897000	1898000	That's how I react
1898000	1899000	To her being gone
1900000	1901000	Yeah
1901000	1902000	I was pissed on my shoes
1902000	1903000	So many times
1904000	1905000	I basically just lay in my bed
1905000	1906000	And I piss on my own stomach
1907000	1908000	Because I'm like
1908000	1910000	Well who was I not doing this for?
1911000	1914000	She's in a different time zone
1914000	1915000	Like not only is she
1915000	1916000	In a different country
1916000	1917000	But her time is different
1917000	1918000	She's looking at a sun
1918000	1919000	When I'm looking at a moon
1919000	1920000	I can pee on myself
1921000	1922000	Finally
1924000	1925000	Are you getting a lot of game
1925000	1926000	Video game play in
1926000	1927000	While she's away?
1927000	1928000	Yeah, yeah, yeah
1930000	1931000	Is this fine?
1931000	1932000	Are you enjoying it?
1932000	1933000	Yeah, very much
1933000	1934000	Far Cry 4
1934000	1935000	Much?
1935000	1936000	Sure, sure
1938000	1939000	But I actually like
1939000	1940000	Far Cry 4 is so kind of
1940000	1941000	Potentially addictive
1941000	1942000	That I've actually been
1942000	1943000	Playing Grand Theft Auto 5
1943000	1944000	For some reason
1944000	1945000	Like I
1945000	1946000	I don't know
1946000	1947000	I think I
1947000	1948000	I don't know what it is
1948000	1949000	I just follow my cravings
1949000	1950000	But I've been playing
1950000	1952000	Grand Theft Auto 5 lately
1953000	1954000	I kept that sweatshirt on
1954000	1955000	For too long
1955000	1956000	And I told you guys last week
1956000	1957000	I'm hotter up here
1957000	1958000	I'm not fatter
1961000	1962000	If I am fatter
1962000	1963000	It's not
1963000	1964000	It's healthy fat
1964000	1965000	It's not coming out of me
1965000	1966000	In the form of liquid
1967000	1968000	If I was sitting
1968000	1969000	Where you were sitting
1969000	1970000	I would look like James Bond
1970000	1975000	Uh, Yvonne Craig
1975000	1977000	We lost Yvonne Craig
1977000	1980000	TV's Batgirl from the Adam West series
1980000	1981000	Wow
1981000	1984000	What do you say about that, you know?
1984000	1986000	Nothing funny
1986000	1987000	No
1987000	1989000	And also nothing particularly sincere
1989000	1991000	Because the true sincere way
1991000	1992000	In which she's a part of my life
1992000	1994000	Is the awakening of my sexuality
1994000	1995000	And it seems
1995000	1996000	It seems offensive to
1996000	1998000	To do that over someone's grave
1998000	1999000	I was like
1999000	2000000	Whoa, thanks for giving me
2000000	2001000	My first boner
2003000	2004000	Throw a little dirt
2007000	2008000	Feels wrong
2008000	2009000	To do that
2009000	2011000	Yeah, but you can be honest
2011000	2013000	With yourself about that, you know?
2013000	2014000	I mean, she was
2014000	2015000	You know what it is?
2015000	2016000	Don't address her
2016000	2017000	As if you're
2017000	2018000	Like, just say
2020000	2021000	It's sad when people die
2021000	2023000	We miss you, stranger
2023000	2024000	Who we never knew
2024000	2025000	Personally
2026000	2027000	Speaking of which
2028000	2029000	Her image
2029000	2030000	On the TV screen
2030000	2031000	When I was
2032000	2033000	You know
2033000	2034000	Six or whatever
2035000	2036000	It's like
2036000	2037000	It was the first like
2037000	2038000	Dopamine spike in my head
2039000	2040000	The Adam West
2040000	2041000	You can save this for the view, man
2043000	2044000	I've often said
2044000	2046000	I hope that Aaron and I
2046000	2049000	Have a beautiful redhead daughter
2049000	2051000	That'll dress like Batgirl
2051000	2053000	Because knowing me
2053000	2055000	No, I'm making fun of myself
2055000	2056000	I'll fuck her
2058000	2060000	No, I'm making fun of myself
2063000	2065000	I'm always fucking redheads
2065000	2067000	My daughter was a redhead
2073000	2075000	It's called self-deprecation, guys
2080000	2081000	That's his idea of a joke
2081000	2083000	Making fun of himself
2083000	2084000	Yeah, he's not too smart
2085000	2086000	I mean, when he says
2086000	2087000	He's often said it
2087000	2088000	Does that include to her
2088000	2089000	Over breakfast?
2092000	2093000	And is it there for any wonder
2093000	2095000	That she's not a violinist, you know
2095000	2096000	That she's just
2104000	2105000	Everybody be perfectly still
2106000	2108000	We have a mythical creature
2108000	2109000	In the room
2110000	2111000	It's the ghost of
2111000	2113000	L.A. Philharmonic stereotypes
2114000	2115000	Laughter
2120000	2121000	That was so cute
2122000	2123000	Was that a man or a woman
2123000	2124000	That made that laugh?
2124000	2125000	That was me
2125000	2126000	That was you?
2126000	2127000	Are you a violinist
2127000	2128000	Or are you just confused
2128000	2129000	By my logic?
2129000	2130000	I can't understand you
2130000	2131000	Oh, okay
2131000	2132000	Interesting
2133000	2135000	To his credit, his face
2135000	2137000	Is kind of bright red right now
2137000	2138000	It's very charming
2139000	2140000	That was a sincere sound
2140000	2142000	He didn't mean to take the spotlight
2143000	2144000	I was saying, well, I'll tell you now
2144000	2146000	Since you put yourself out there
2146000	2148000	I will put myself out there
2148000	2150000	I guess in the moment when I was riffing
2150000	2152000	And maybe if we pick this apart
2152000	2153000	We'll probably find out
2153000	2155000	Find out that I'm sexist somehow
2155000	2157000	But I was saying like
2157000	2158000	If you're eating breakfast with a guy
2158000	2160000	That talks like that to you
2160000	2162000	Because isn't she like a model?
2162000	2163000	I don't know the first thing
2163000	2166000	I thought she was also like a business person
2166000	2167000	Alright, fine
2167000	2168000	Fine
2169000	2170000	See, I'm sexist
2171000	2172000	I thought she was a model
2172000	2173000	That's the end of that story
2173000	2174000	I thought she was a model
2175000	2176000	I didn't think
2176000	2177000	It was me
2177000	2179000	I didn't think it was possible for her to be anything else
2179000	2181000	I don't get the Philharmonic stereotype joke
2181000	2182000	What is that?
2183000	2185000	Well, that's not gonna
2185000	2187000	Pull up if you pick it apart
2187000	2188000	Oh, okay
2188000	2190000	I thought you were connecting some
2192000	2194000	Okay, my joke was
2194000	2195000	But it wouldn't make sense
2195000	2196000	That it was the ghost of
2196000	2197000	L.A. Philharmonic stereotype
2197000	2198000	My joke was
2199000	2201000	That was an entity in the crowd
2201000	2204000	That was tired of violinists being stereotyped
2204000	2205000	You understand what I'm saying?
2205000	2206000	Oh, yeah, okay
2206000	2208000	But the ghost of stereotype doesn't make any sense
2208000	2209000	So you caught me again
2209000	2210000	No, no, I was
2210000	2212000	I just thought I was missing something out
2212000	2215000	Maybe it shouldn't be a free podcast
2219000	2221000	What if we made it free
2221000	2223000	But if you wanted to listen to
2223000	2225000	Episodes older than a year
2225000	2227000	You had to pay five bucks a month
2229000	2231000	Yeah, Dustin, high five
2231000	2232000	Yeah
2232000	2234000	No, we're not gonna have any cross-label shit talk tonight
2234000	2235000	Because of our special guest
2235000	2236000	Is our special guest here?
2236000	2237000	Is he here?
2237000	2238000	Oh, cool
2238000	2239000	Great
2240000	2242000	Our special guest has an earwolf podcast
2242000	2244000	So now you've done it
2244000	2246000	It's not anymore
2246000	2247000	No
2247000	2248000	Wait, what?
2248000	2249000	It's not an earwolf and you know
2249000	2250000	Oh
2250000	2254000	Now who's being the brash
2254000	2255000	That's not the word
2256000	2257000	Ka-zing
2257000	2258000	Yeah
2260000	2261000	Pam-fisted
2261000	2263000	That's the word I was looking for
2263000	2264000	Is he just wandering now?
2264000	2265000	Is he a free agent?
2267000	2269000	Okay, because we'll poach his ass
2269000	2270000	We'll scoop him up
2272000	2273000	That's easy for us to do
2273000	2275000	Now, pianist guy, what's your name?
2275000	2276000	Martin Lewis
2276000	2277000	Martin Lewis and
2278000	2279000	Barton
2279000	2280000	Barton Lewis
2280000	2282000	And the guy next to you, what's your name?
2283000	2284000	You seem to know a lot about this
2284000	2287000	Do you work with Horatio?
2288000	2289000	I think they're part of his team
2289000	2291000	They're how we were able to connect with Michael
2291000	2292000	Oh great, welcome to the show
2292000	2293000	Thanks for getting them for us
2293000	2295000	Well, let's bring them up
2295000	2297000	I totally blew the reveal on that
2298000	2299000	Yeah, yeah
2299000	2300000	It could be any Horatio
2300000	2302000	We don't know which Horatio I'm talking about
2302000	2304000	Right, so I didn't hear you say Horatio
2304000	2306000	But now, fuck Jesus
2310000	2312000	Horatio Cummings, everybody
2313000	2315000	Maybe it's a hornblower?
2315000	2317000	Horatio Hornblower
2322000	2324000	Maybe it's a fifth Ninja Turtle?
2327000	2330000	It's more important to introduce the kind of like
2330000	2332000	I think one of the things that we're going to be talking to him about
2332000	2333000	I hope
2333000	2334000	I hope to
2336000	2338000	At least once on this show
2338000	2340000	And then I know on Doug Love's movies
2341000	2344000	We've talked about our fascination with this movie Boat Trip
2351000	2353000	I was looking at the Wikipedia entry
2353000	2356000	You click that reception header and it comes down
2356000	2360000	It is a kind of historically critically panned movie
2360000	2362000	It takes its place up there
2366000	2369000	It's one of those movies that's so
2369000	2372000	It's fascinating and confusing
2372000	2373000	In a lot of parts
2373000	2375000	And so we have talked about it
2375000	2378000	And I say that without fear of being petty
2378000	2380000	Because I know he didn't write it or direct it or anything
2380000	2382000	Now I feel like the writer or director is going to kill himself
2382000	2383000	But I
2384000	2385000	They probably
2385000	2388000	The bottom line is movies are flukes and God only knows what happens
2388000	2390000	But he heard me talking about it
2390000	2392000	Or someone heard me talking about it on Doug Love's movies
2392000	2393000	Somebody got in touch with somebody
2393000	2395000	Demorge Brown was involved somehow
2395000	2396000	Something happened
2396000	2397000	And they were like, he should come on the show
2397000	2400000	And I think he was game either that or he's just the nicest guy in the world
2400000	2402000	And was just like, why is everyone telling me to come here?
2402000	2404000	And then now it's mean
2404000	2406000	But I think he was involved too
2406000	2407000	And was like, yeah, I want to come and talk about it
2407000	2408000	Anyways
2409000	2411000	At any rate, it'll be interesting to talk to him about anything
2411000	2415000	Because he's been a part of the comedic wallpaper for over a decade
2415000	2417000	Like he's a founding member of
2418000	2420000	He's a founding member of the right word
2420000	2422000	Like he was down there in the trenches
2422000	2425000	When Upright Citizens Brigade was just an actual
2425000	2428000	Down right non-citizen brigade
2430000	2433000	And he was on SNL for years and years and years and years
2433000	2436000	And then he was on a boat trip
2440000	2441000	And all kinds of other stuff
2441000	2443000	But let's bring him out and get to know him
2443000	2444000	Horatio Sands is here
2456000	2457000	How you doing?
2462000	2464000	Sorry about my horrible introduction
2464000	2466000	And sorry in advance for my bad interviewing
2466000	2469000	Well, no, I'm glad you explained to everybody what was happening
2471000	2473000	Are you being sarcastic?
2474000	2475000	I did want them to know
2475000	2476000	No, no, I'm not
2476000	2478000	I really, I'm glad that you did actually
2478000	2479000	Yeah
2479000	2481000	But I'm not even sure
2481000	2483000	Can you catch us up on your part?
2483000	2489000	Because I haven't talked to you about this until now
2489000	2491000	I didn't see you in the green room, for instance
2491000	2492000	So I don't know
2492000	2495000	Were you ambushed or did somebody urge you to do this?
2495000	2497000	Or were you listening to Douglas movies?
2497000	2498000	What was this?
2498000	2499000	No, someone heard it
2499000	2502000	And then he's actually working on the podcast I'm working on
2502000	2503000	So he's like, you should listen to it
2503000	2504000	And then you should go on it
2505000	2507000	And then I listened to it
2507000	2508000	And now I'm here
2509000	2510000	All right
2511000	2512000	Forgive me, Hooray Show Up
2512000	2514000	What is the name of your podcast?
2514000	2515000	The Hooray Show
2519000	2520000	Oh, I just got that
2520000	2521000	Nice, real nice
2521000	2523000	Yeah, I really did
2523000	2524000	A lot of people just get it
2524000	2525000	That's why it's hard to find
2525000	2528000	But it is the word hooray and then show
2528000	2530000	And then at the end, you know, you go, oh, I get it
2530000	2531000	Hooray
2531000	2533000	Wait, now I just got the show part
2534000	2535000	No, a lot of levels
2535000	2536000	I'm working on a lot of levels
2536000	2539000	I thought the hooray was enough
2539000	2541000	And then the last part is show
2541000	2543000	No, it's like making your whole name
2543000	2544000	Yeah
2545000	2546000	You should do a podcast
2547000	2548000	I do, I do
2549000	2551000	And it's not on Airwolf, as we were reminded
2551000	2554000	By another associate of mine, Julia
2555000	2556000	But, you know, you can
2556000	2559000	I don't know if I'll get yelled at this
2559000	2561000	But make him a Feral Audio podcast
2561000	2562000	Okay, good
2562000	2563000	There we go
2563000	2564000	Thank you
2564000	2565000	Welcome to the Feral Audio Network
2565000	2566000	We have
2566000	2568000	Oh, are we just absorbing him right now?
2568000	2571000	We have a potluck every Thursday
2571000	2572000	That's a little high maintenance
2572000	2577000	But only if your downloads are below a certain number
2577000	2580000	Are you actually expected to bring, like, potluck stuff?
2580000	2584000	Like, I just show up and fucking shit Duncan Trussell makes
2584000	2585000	And I'm like, what's this?
2590000	2593000	So, okay, so I don't
2593000	2595000	I mean, there's a million things we can talk about
2595000	2597000	Well, we should really talk about
2598000	2599000	Boat trip
2599000	2600000	Boat trip, yeah
2600000	2601000	Yeah, but I feel like
2601000	2602000	I feel like once we get there
2602000	2604000	It's going to be weird to segue out of it
2604000	2605000	So I just
2605000	2606000	No, no, it'll be fascinating
2606000	2607000	You'll love it
2608000	2609000	I just do want to say one thing
2609000	2612000	I am here because they're releasing it on Criterion Collection
2615000	2616000	Sweet
2616000	2619000	A lot of cool audio commentary with me in Cuba
2621000	2623000	We have the ex-wife of Roger Moore
2623000	2624000	Who's going to provide some commentary
2624000	2625000	So it's all good
2628000	2629000	The one other thing
2629000	2630000	Because I'm going to forget it
2630000	2631000	If we start talking about boat trips
2631000	2632000	So I just want to say
2632000	2633000	The other piece of trivia
2633000	2636000	Is that you literally stole, took
2636000	2637000	You didn't steal
2637000	2638000	Because it didn't belong to me
2638000	2639000	You took
2639000	2640000	You were
2640000	2642000	It was down to me and you
2642000	2645000	For the role of the Manny on In the Mother
2645000	2646000	Who won?
2647000	2649000	I won the larger war
2649000	2650000	You didn't get it
2652000	2653000	Yeah
2653000	2654000	How many episodes did it run?
2654000	2655000	But it was
2655000	2656000	It ran seven
2656000	2657000	It was like
2657000	2658000	I somehow made it through
2658000	2661000	This weird gauntlet of people that must have been
2661000	2665000	Actually, I remember Besser was in some of the early auditions
2665000	2666000	And callbacks and stuff
2667000	2668000	And then I was like
2668000	2672000	Wait, I think I might be in the running
2672000	2674000	And they just brought you in at the last minute
2674000	2675000	And then I was like
2675000	2676000	Oh, God, they hate me, I'm fucked
2676000	2677000	Because they were like
2677000	2678000	Oh, just
2678000	2681000	They thought of you and found you and brought you in
2681000	2682000	And it was obviously like
2682000	2683000	You had gotten the part
2683000	2684000	Because before that
2684000	2685000	I was slipping through the cracks undetected
2686000	2687000	And then I saw you
2687000	2688000	And I was like
2688000	2689000	Oh, boy
2690000	2693000	They found a professional actor
2694000	2696000	No, I remember that time
2696000	2698000	I heard you were a great guy
2700000	2702000	But I do remember that
2704000	2706000	I felt that you were a little nervous
2706000	2707000	Oh, yeah
2707000	2708000	So I kind of was like
2708000	2709000	Okay
2709000	2711000	Because I didn't know who you were
2711000	2714000	But whenever you get into those situations
2715000	2719000	You're either the type of guy who thinks you can twist the other guy around
2719000	2720000	Right
2720000	2721000	Or you're the guy who's just like
2721000	2723000	Ah, no games
2723000	2724000	You know
2724000	2727000	And so I thought we actually were very pleasant to each other
2727000	2728000	Oh, yeah, sure
2728000	2730000	And not that I was cool under fire
2730000	2732000	But I definitely was not going to be at the level
2732000	2736000	Where I'm thinking of how I can psych Horatio Sands out of the part
2736000	2737000	I was just like
2737000	2740000	Yeah, I was just plain and simple nervous
2740000	2741000	And I really was
2742000	2743000	Because I was like
2743000	2744000	You know what?
2744000	2746000	For the first part, he's been on SNL, I'm done
2746000	2748000	I really thought I was going to coast in under the radar
2748000	2751000	Because I'm not fishing for anything
2751000	2752000	I'm not from that world
2752000	2753000	I'm not an actor
2753000	2755000	And I can't believe that world
2755000	2757000	That being an actor in particular
2757000	2759000	Which is one of the thousand things we could just talk about
2759000	2760000	Nothing else
2760000	2762000	This idea that you're in charge of everything
2762000	2764000	But you control nothing
2765000	2767000	How do you deal with helplessness
2767000	2769000	And the ego crushing
2770000	2772000	Do you keep a penny in your pocket
2772000	2773000	And just press it into your palm
2774000	2776000	Luckily, I do a lot of improv
2776000	2777000	So I get to kind of
2777000	2781000	Write my own stuff through improv
2781000	2784000	So that kind of keeps you from going a little crazy
2784000	2788000	But now I'm at a time where I don't have to take stuff
2788000	2789000	If I don't really like it
2789000	2795000	So I do well enough not to have to be homeless
2795000	2798000	You're definitely, and this is where we could get
2798000	2799000	Maybe I'll be prying or whatever
2799000	2801000	But what I've heard
2801000	2803000	Kind of the legend of you
2803000	2806000	You're actually born in Chile
2806000	2809000	But you're from Chicago in all the ways that matter
2809000	2811000	Including the fact that you were like a
2811000	2812000	You were a party guy
2812000	2814000	Like you had a wooden leg
2814000	2816000	Or what do they call it, hollow leg
2817000	2819000	You could knock back the sauce
2819000	2821000	Yeah, yeah, I was really good
2821000	2822000	Yeah
2824000	2826000	And then you quit
2826000	2828000	And it's not a fluke
2828000	2830000	You lost a hundred pounds
2830000	2833000	And you've credited it to changing that
2833000	2836000	About your lifestyle and all that stuff
2836000	2838000	You look like you're 25 now
2838000	2840000	And it's been that way for a long time
2840000	2842000	So I don't have to worry about me pointing that out
2842000	2844000	Like knocking you off the wagon
2844000	2845000	No, no, no
2845000	2847000	Yeah, it is that
2847000	2848000	It was that
2848000	2853000	And it's different to go around and be different looking
2853000	2854000	But it's kind of great
2854000	2857000	Because I think I would be dead if I didn't do it
2857000	2859000	When did you stop drinking?
2859000	2861000	Like 10 years ago, I think
2861000	2863000	Yeah, because I think I've been...
2863000	2865000	We used to drink a lot, yeah
2865000	2867000	We used to like, rustic in days, yeah
2867000	2869000	Used to carry a case
2869000	2871000	I did, I read the executor
2871000	2873000	Yeah, yeah
2873000	2876000	He had a case with shot glasses and absinthe
2876000	2880000	It's cool like 1950s, 60s, like Mad Men kind of things
2880000	2881000	Yeah
2881000	2883000	And you open it up in their velvet line
2883000	2885000	And there's little tumblers and ice spoons and whatnot
2885000	2886000	And they're really groovy
2886000	2887000	And they're really cool
2887000	2888000	Yeah, it's a level of...
2888000	2891000	It's called the Dipsa Maniac's Delight
2893000	2895000	That's one of the old ads for the Executat
2895000	2898000	What is a Dipsa Maniac? Was that a 50s word for alcoholic?
2898000	2899000	I guess so, yeah
2899000	2900000	Is it a drinker?
2900000	2902000	Yeah, like a heavy drinker
2902000	2903000	A compotator
2905000	2908000	Are you truly, truly cold turkey sober?
2908000	2911000	Or did you just go like, okay, this isn't going to be my lifestyle anymore?
2911000	2912000	Is it possible?
2912000	2915000	I went cold turkey and then I went to AA meetings for a while
2915000	2920000	And they were kind of fascinating because the characters were just insane
2920000	2925000	And I kind of almost got addicted to going just to see the people tell their stories
2925000	2929000	Because, you know, they're always just like, in the end now, when I was blowing that cop
2929000	2931000	I was like, enough's enough
2931000	2935000	You know, and I really had to take account of what I was up to
2935000	2936000	Yeah
2936000	2938000	Fucking good, yeah
2938000	2940000	And then there's this guy, this guy who would talk like this
2940000	2942000	You know, I'm not going to say anything about it
2942000	2944000	You know, I'm just like, you know, I did it this girl
2944000	2948000	She's talking like, hey, you know what, I hit her once, okay, okay
2948000	2952000	And then this fucking alcoholic is in there just talking about beating up ladies
2952000	2955000	And everybody's like, come on now
2955000	2959000	It's beyond being an alcoholic, just a fucking maniac
2964000	2965000	Alright, so
2965000	2966000	Boat trip
2966000	2967000	Boat trip
2968000	2969000	Let's go back
2971000	2973000	Because I want to get lost in this
2973000	2974000	Alright
2974000	2976000	So, let me just say right now
2976000	2978000	Who wrote the film?
2978000	2981000	Sometimes when I talk about this movie
2981000	2984000	There is a little pride in it, and then there also is a lot of shame
2984000	2988000	And one thing I feel too right now is like I start giving people's names out
2988000	2991000	It's like the Nuremberg trials
2992000	2993000	Who else?
2993000	2995000	Who else was involved?
2997000	3000000	Like your agents on the back
3000000	3002000	Wait, did you tell them that you changed agencies?
3003000	3005000	And in fact, I did
3006000	3011000	I know a couple of the writers are rumored to be hiding in Argentina to this day
3013000	3015000	Very nice guys
3015000	3021000	One of them, the director, was a very nice man called Mort Nathan
3021000	3022000	And he was kind of
3022000	3029000	He had rounded up a cadre of writers from where he worked, which was the Golden Girls
3030000	3035000	So, the guy who writes for the Golden Girls, I'm like, well, Golden Girls is pretty good
3037000	3039000	Mitch Hurwitz worked on Golden Girls
3039000	3040000	Yeah, no worries there
3040000	3045000	And then, Cuba Gooding Jr. like you had mentioned on the podcast, he won Oscar
3045000	3047000	And then 30 seconds later made this movie
3047000	3049000	And sank his career
3049000	3052000	It felt like for him, 9 movies came out at the same time
3052000	3054000	It's almost like he somehow like
3054000	3058000	They rushed Jerry Maguire out or something
3058000	3060000	And it actually was made
3060000	3063000	Wait, I'm getting my timeline right
3063000	3066000	But it was just weird because it was like boat trip and talking dogs
3066000	3069000	And like, he was a guy that found a genie in space
3069000	3073000	And like, it all came out, it felt like it came out a month after Jerry Maguire
3073000	3075000	Yeah, and I think
3077000	3079000	I think at that time, after the Oscar
3079000	3081000	I think he had this thing where it's like
3081000	3083000	Just wire $3 million into my bank account
3084000	3088000	And if it's there in the morning, I'll meet you in Italy and we'll make this movie
3089000	3090000	It was that kind of thing
3090000	3095000	And to understand why, you have to understand the tragic story of Cuba Gooding Sr.
3098000	3100000	Yeah, he was a revolutionary
3100000	3102000	A lot of people call them Cuba batting
3103000	3107000	That's how hard his life, please, you keep talking please
3107000	3117000	And no matter how bad the story gets, it won't matter because I'm using chicken times
3119000	3125000	Yeah, so it was I think the summer of 99, I think, maybe
3125000	3127000	I remember having to
3129000	3134000	I remember I was asked to promote Boat Trip a week after 9-11
3137000	3139000	They were like, just come on and take pictures
3139000	3144000	I'm like, dudes, it's 9-12, I don't really want to be on a plane
3145000	3148000	And I'm like, it's not that I'm afraid that right now every plane is going to blow up
3148000	3152000	But I don't want to be on a plane thinking about the fact that two days ago
3152000	3156000	I saw the second tower collapse in Lower Manhattan
3157000	3159000	So, that's just a little side note
3160000	3162000	There was a looming rider strike
3162000	3163000	Do you remember this?
3163000	3164000	Yeah, yes
3164000	3166000	So you had already made the film or you had not made the film?
3166000	3168000	I had not made the film, I'm going back
3168000	3170000	2001 is when I had to promote it
3170000	3173000	But go back to whenever it was, 1999
3173000	3175000	There was going to be a rider strike that summer
3175000	3178000	So everybody was like, you got to do a movie, you got to do a movie
3178000	3181000	And this was one of those movies, one of those you got to do a movie
3181000	3183000	Because they might not make another movie for two years
3183000	3187000	And you're going to be back in a snow and you can only do it in this window
3187000	3192000	So Cuba Gooding, the script was pretty bad when I first read it
3192000	3195000	But I was told that I would be able to help rewrite it
3196000	3199000	And I didn't get a chance to do that
3201000	3202000	I was not allowed to do that
3202000	3206000	It's weird, someone in show business kind of pulled a trick on me, I don't know
3207000	3210000	Or just for like, they just didn't even realize what they were saying
3210000	3216000	Sometimes I feel like agents, I hesitate to say my agent who I've trusted for like almost 20 years
3216000	3221000	But like all agents, like they, it's not that they're lying as much as it is
3221000	3227000	Like they just don't, their priorities are so skewed that they don't know that they're lying
3228000	3230000	Maybe they don't want to think about the lying
3230000	3235000	Yeah, they are convinced when they tell you that the right thing to do is this or that
3235000	3239000	Like they do, because they have lots of mythology to back them up
3239000	3244000	They're like, you know who's picky about his roles? Hitler? I don't know
3244000	3252000	Like, they offered him, he would have been like Johnny Weissmuller
3252000	3254000	They were looking for a new Tarzan and Hitler passed
3255000	3257000	Because he thought it would be tacky
3257000	3259000	You know what's tacky? Killing six million Jews
3259000	3260000	Absolutely
3261000	3264000	So anyways, are you enjoying the flatbread? I love this place
3265000	3267000	I'm sorry, I was in the scene, I was in the scene
3267000	3268000	I was your agent
3269000	3274000	Always said, my space wreck was so good that the YUGB guy was like lost
3277000	3280000	Or it was so bad that a professional improviser was like, why are you doing?
3280000	3283000	It was so good I thought someone had flatbread over here
3283000	3286000	I'm like, that's weird, these guys are eating flatbread
3287000	3289000	Alright, so sorry, I don't know why I keep interrupting
3289000	3294000	I'm like, they won't know it's my show, tell the story of Boat Trip, let me shut the fuck up
3295000	3300000	So I get a call and they're saying that, well if you don't do it, Artie Lang's gonna do it
3302000	3304000	And then they're like, Roger Moore's in it
3304000	3307000	And I was like, fuck, I love Roger Moore, he was my bond
3307000	3309000	You know, my age coincides with that bond
3309000	3313000	So I'm like, I'd be able to do scenes with my bond
3313000	3318000	So I slept on it, and I had a dream where Abraham Lincoln, this is no lie
3319000	3326000	In this dream, Abraham Lincoln says, don't do things for money
3332000	3335000	It's all I ever did, now I'm on two kinds of them
3339000	3343000	If I had held out, I jumped on the penny
3343000	3346000	I didn't know the five dollar bill was gonna get pitched to me
3349000	3352000	I said I wouldn't talk
3352000	3356000	No, no, please do, because there has to be funny things talked about
3356000	3358000	Abraham Lincoln said, don't do things for money
3358000	3362000	And that's your Abraham Lincoln voice, who's never been recorded, so we don't know
3362000	3368000	I prefer that it's not like Minnie Mouse or something
3368000	3369000	They say he had a high-pitched
3369000	3373000	Yeah, yeah, but I want to talk to your Abraham Lincoln
3374000	3377000	Can we talk to your Abraham Lincoln just for a little bit more
3378000	3379000	I'm your roommate
3380000	3381000	Hello, how are you
3382000	3387000	Listen, Abe, the lint trap in the machine, the dryer fills up
3387000	3390000	So after every load, you have to clean it out
3390000	3393000	Oh, that's good to make bedding
3395000	3398000	Right, you're from a more resourceful time
3398000	3400000	Oh, yeah, yeah
3401000	3404000	We'd sleep too to a bed, you know
3404000	3408000	I'd prefer if we didn't, but I noticed you did last night, and I'm not homophobic
3409000	3412000	There is another bedroom in the apartment for you
3413000	3415000	Yeah, and I like it
3415000	3418000	I like it, I like that you're free about stuff
3419000	3422000	You know, where I'm from, slavery was cool
3422000	3423000	Yeah
3424000	3425000	Oh, that's
3425000	3428000	No, it's not, so things, you know, things change
3428000	3435000	I'm really, I'm really happy with, like, you know, this gay marriage situation
3435000	3439000	I couldn't dream of doing that when I was with old Mary Todd, you know
3441000	3442000	Although I did
3442000	3446000	It must have kind of broke your heart, it must have kind of broke your heart when Horatio made that movie
3447000	3448000	Remember, you were pretty
3448000	3449000	Lincoln?
3450000	3452000	Are we in the present right now?
3453000	3454000	Are we back?
3454000	3459000	Didn't you say you transported into Horatio Sands's dream last night and warned him not to do things for money
3460000	3462000	I just read the trades today, he's
3462000	3464000	He ignored me, he's doing it
3466000	3470000	He's doing a sex farce in Germany with German people
3471000	3475000	You took such, I've never seen you Abe in the six months we've been living together
3476000	3477000	Since we met through Craigslist
3479000	3483000	I've never seen you take such an active interest in a modern American performer
3483000	3485000	What was it about you and Horatio?
3485000	3487000	Well, it's just the right time, you know, like
3488000	3490000	Oh, I know, he's from Illinois, I'm from Illinois
3490000	3491000	Oh, that's what it is!
3492000	3493000	He's a Chicago man
3493000	3498000	And he was in some drunk, ambient haze and was like, Lincoln, what should I do?
3499000	3501000	I told him, I told him what I would do
3502000	3506000	Okay, ending the scene because that's a really interesting concept
3506000	3510000	So, because this is really actually true for what we understand of psychology
3510000	3513000	unless you believe the ghost of Lincoln came into your dream
3513000	3514000	I don't
3514000	3519000	The funnier, the more poetic truth is that in your mind, you thought
3519000	3522000	My mind was figuring it out for me, it was doing it
3522000	3524000	You conjured the icon of integrity
3524000	3526000	Yeah, yeah
3527000	3534000	I wanted, I created this character in my brain to tell me in my sleep to not do this movie
3535000	3537000	And I ignored it
3538000	3542000	But yeah, I could spend the next half hour
3544000	3547000	You don't need to be let off the hook for that, right?
3547000	3552000	You don't feel like you made a bad, do you feel bad about it?
3552000	3556000	I do feel, no, I feel bad about, I feel bad that it's a joke
3557000	3558000	No, please
3560000	3563000	But it was much like when I played at Mariachi on Saturday Night Live
3564000	3568000	I was like, it's okay because people see me in other things
3568000	3571000	So, Bo Trip has become okay because I've done many other things
3571000	3575000	where I've been able to be funny and happy with what I did
3576000	3579000	People still come up to me and tell me about Bo Trip
3580000	3582000	Mostly Puerto Rican and black people
3583000	3586000	In New York, they all love that movie
3588000	3592000	And also, when I did a show in Iraq
3593000	3597000	and the soldiers told me that part of their welcome bag was Bo Trip
3598000	3601000	So, I have a lot of fans in Iraq
3602000	3605000	And I signed a bunch of Bo Trip DVDs
3607000	3610000	But that was kind of fitting also that I was in Iraq
3610000	3614000	and just like seeing what a mess this whole fucking thing was
3614000	3618000	Right, because you were there at 9-11 and saw the buildings collapsing
3618000	3624000	and now you were in the Bo Trip of 9-11, which is the Iraq War
3627000	3630000	The result of the White House not listening to Abe Lincoln
3633000	3636000	If I had just listened to Abe Lincoln, there would be no terrorism
3637000	3639000	This was just a string of events that happened
3639000	3642000	Wait, no, I didn't mean to imply that
3643000	3646000	I think you can correlate when I decided to do Bo Trip
3646000	3651000	with the beginning of the terrorist planning
3653000	3656000	There's a lot of conspiracies about it, but...
3656000	3658000	Jeff, yes
3659000	3661000	Alright, so you say, yes, I'll do the movie
3661000	3666000	And day one, what was the vibe on the set?
3667000	3668000	Did you know?
3668000	3671000	I knew pretty right away that it was off
3671000	3672000	It was not working?
3672000	3679000	Yeah, I flew from New York and had to be there that morning
3679000	3681000	So I didn't really sleep
3681000	3684000	And then it was just what I thought was going to be a thing
3684000	3686000	where we could look at the script the night before
3686000	3689000	and maybe work on some scenes was just like, we do two takes
3691000	3694000	One for you, and then one where you improvise
3695000	3699000	So basically, what I was told wasn't happening
3699000	3702000	So it was very, very under-the-gun filmmaking
3702000	3704000	Half the crew was German
3704000	3707000	because it was a half German production
3707000	3710000	And they hated us, and we hated them
3711000	3713000	And what else happened?
3713000	3715000	Well, is the scene...
3715000	3717000	Oh, yeah, yeah, let's talk about the scenes
3717000	3719000	I want to know, the scene when all the jizz flies out the portal
3719000	3721000	and lands on... is it lands on Roger Moore?
3721000	3723000	Who gets hit with the jizz?
3724000	3726000	His name is...
3730000	3732000	Here he is, sorry
3733000	3736000	Yes, Your Honor, hold on a second, I'm thinking
3737000	3739000	And was he told he was in a jizz joke?
3739000	3742000	He knew something about Mary had a jizz joke
3742000	3744000	He had a chance to say no
3744000	3748000	They asked him if he wanted to be the guy that caught the jizz
3749000	3752000	Eleanor Roosevelt came to him in a dream
3752000	3755000	Anyway, he was one of the writers it was on
3755000	3758000	And so the porthole scene
3758000	3761000	But rewinding, because the reason he's coming out the porthole
3761000	3764000	and you kids can rent this this week
3765000	3770000	If you haven't, if I'm not mistaken, the reason Cuba is coming out the porthole
3770000	3775000	is because this is the culmination of him pretending to be gay
3775000	3778000	so that he can be close to this Vivica Fox
3778000	3781000	Yes, and she starts eating a banana
3781000	3784000	So the banana is the most important thing
3784000	3786000	If a bus was coming through this wall
3786000	3788000	and I got out of the way or pushed you out of the way
3788000	3790000	I would go, the banana, tell me about the banana
3790000	3792000	Oh yeah, the banana
3792000	3794000	Because I don't want to die without
3794000	3796000	I don't even want to live without
3796000	3799000	The banana, in high def
3799000	3801000	when she's eating the banana
3801000	3803000	The dick shape
3803000	3804000	The banana is chiseled into the shape
3804000	3806000	I didn't know this
3806000	3808000	Well, you weren't even in that scene
3808000	3812000	And I do want to say, I'm not saying this in a
3812000	3815000	I don't know, I feel like there's a similar
3815000	3817000	We had Dana Carvey on the show
3817000	3819000	who I was at the time taking on this pitch
3819000	3821000	He's amazing stuff
3821000	3823000	He expressed so much
3823000	3825000	There's a sad side to this
3825000	3827000	which has nothing to do with whether
3827000	3829000	The idea that there's a human cost
3829000	3831000	The idea that you actually feel
3831000	3833000	still that you feel when people are
3833000	3835000	that you feel like you
3835000	3837000	that you did something wrong
3837000	3839000	or that you have a lower quality
3839000	3841000	to your worth by virtue of a choice
3841000	3843000	A little bit, just from a choice
3844000	3846000	The reason the population of the Earth
3846000	3848000	is 8 billion is because everybody
3848000	3850000	makes bad choices with the most
3850000	3852000	the most important thing you could ever
3852000	3854000	choose of all is whether or not
3854000	3855000	you should fuck somebody
3855000	3857000	And we have a 70% divorce rate
3857000	3860000	We're human mistakes
3860000	3862000	You can't know, that's not your job
3862000	3863000	to know you're an actor
3863000	3864000	Oh, thank you
3864000	3866000	It's not like a Horatio
3866000	3868000	Horatio, Sansa, Koopa and Gooding are
3868000	3871000	the things like you guys had a
3871000	3872000	two man comedy troupe and you're like
3872000	3874000	we want to make this movie
3874000	3876000	Even then that would have been amazing
3876000	3878000	Yeah, but I feel like as a comedian
3878000	3880000	and someone who's a social critic
3880000	3883000	I guess just by being a comedian
3883000	3888000	you have to take your shots
3888000	3890000	I would still like to tell people
3890000	3892000	that I care about like this sucks
3892000	3893000	and this is why I don't like it
3893000	3896000	But it has made it a little difficult
3896000	3898000	because that is attached to me
3898000	3900000	So in a way it's kind of humbled me
3900000	3901000	in a way
3901000	3903000	Which can't be bad
3903000	3904000	No, no
3904000	3905000	That could totally be good
3905000	3906000	No, and like you said
3906000	3907000	it is true
3907000	3908000	If that's what I really
3908000	3909000	Yeah, but nobody watching that movie
3909000	3911000	blames you for any of what went wrong
3911000	3912000	with that film
3912000	3913000	You're fine in it
3913000	3915000	It's just that the movie is the culprit here
3915000	3918000	And as you said, the fact that the crew
3918000	3919000	is half German
3919000	3920000	That's the point where you start to go like
3920000	3921000	Oh yeah
3921000	3923000	Because that's how weird it feels
3923000	3924000	Right
3924000	3927000	It's not like geely
3927000	3929000	Which I have never seen
3929000	3931000	So why did I just shit all over that movie
3931000	3933000	But it's historically like
3933000	3936000	There's stories of hubris behind
3936000	3937000	historically bad movies
3937000	3940000	Of like so and so thought he was such king shit
3940000	3941000	That he thought he'd do this
3941000	3942000	This was a first time director
3942000	3945000	And now we know a half German crew
3945000	3946000	Yeah
3946000	3950000	And we were shooting in Brussels
3950000	3953000	We were shooting in Germany as LA
3953000	3955000	And then when we went on the boat trip
3955000	3957000	We actually did go on a boat
3957000	3959000	So half the crew was
3959000	3962000	Half the people on the boat were making this film
3962000	3964000	And then the other people didn't know
3964000	3967000	So
3967000	3970000	So they were really mad that we were shooting
3970000	3972000	In the hot tub
3972000	3975000	We were closing up the hot tub in the pool
3975000	3977000	And they were really mad at us
3977000	3980000	But you weren't on set for the banana scene
3980000	3983000	I mean, what do you know about the banana?
3983000	3985000	The Vivica Fox is eating a banana
3985000	3987000	The joke is that she's showing him how she
3987000	3989000	She's not actually showing him how she eats a banana
3989000	3992000	And it's ironically like dick sucking
3992000	3995000	She's showing him how she gives a blowjob, right?
3995000	3998000	She's demonstrating with a banana
3998000	4001000	Yeah, there's that thing in a date that happens when you're on a date
4001000	4005000	And the woman starts showing you how she would blow you on a piece of fruit
4005000	4008000	Well, this is something women do with gay men too all the time
4008000	4009000	It's like, oh, you're gay?
4009000	4011000	Well, let me just like rub my tits on you
4011000	4013000	And talk about sucking dick
4014000	4016000	And
4016000	4019000	But the weirdest thing of all
4019000	4023000	Which is why you should never have to worry about the movie reflecting on you at all
4023000	4025000	Because it's surreal
4025000	4028000	The whole movie from front to back is absolutely surreal
4028000	4031000	You might as well just be in a Jackson Pollock painting, like waving
4031000	4033000	Well, that's cool
4033000	4036000	Ten years from now, we may find out this movie's good
4036000	4039000	That's how fucking weird it is
4039000	4041000	And one of the weird things about it is
4041000	4045000	The banana that she's demonstrating a filet show on
4045000	4048000	It cuts in close and she's like licking it
4048000	4054000	And for some reason, the prop master has shaped the head of the banana
4054000	4061000	Into a like very faithful like helmet of a cock
4062000	4069000	So the joke is that somehow God created these wonderful fruit
4070000	4074000	And the joke is that, look, it came out looking like a real dick
4074000	4076000	So
4076000	4078000	It's perfect
4078000	4080000	It should be sucked on
4080000	4081000	But that's it
4081000	4082000	Right? Because I don't
4082000	4084000	I actually don't really remember
4084000	4086000	It's just such a weird thing to happen
4086000	4087000	I've not watched it on HD
4087000	4088000	It's such a strange afterthought
4088000	4089000	And then
4089000	4090000	It's been so long since I've seen it
4090000	4092000	But in my mind
4092000	4094000	Then there's just a snowball effect
4094000	4096000	Wild shit starts happening
4096000	4098000	And he's like trying to keep it in his pants
4099000	4101000	And while she turns her back
4101000	4102000	He just unleashes
4102000	4106000	I recall this being like half a gallon of gum
4107000	4108000	Well, it was
4108000	4109000	If you want to know the truth
4109000	4110000	It was grosser than that
4110000	4112000	Because it was not a realistic amount
4112000	4115000	But like a bucket would have been then
4115000	4117000	It would have taken you to Dracula dead and loving it territory
4117000	4118000	It'd be like, well, that's silly
4118000	4120000	Nobody comes that much
4120000	4123000	But it was disgusting because he
4123000	4126000	When I thrust his hips out the porthole
4126000	4127000	And goes
4128000	4131000	In my memory for no reason
4131000	4133000	Just because it seems like something that should happen
4133000	4134000	The ship's horn goes
4137000	4139000	And then it cuts to outside
4139000	4142000	And apparently the porthole is above
4142000	4145000	People who are on deck enjoying the night air
4145000	4150000	And one of the actors has a semi-realistic amount
4150000	4153000	Of pure white thick gum
4153000	4154000	Sunscreen
4154000	4156000	Yeah, well, it looks like sunscreen
4156000	4157000	It really does
4157000	4158000	Falls on his face
4158000	4159000	And then they make a joke like
4159000	4160000	Oh, there's a bird out here
4160000	4162000	And the weird thing is
4162000	4165000	If you thought a bird shit on your face
4165000	4167000	You'd react almost the same
4167000	4170000	As if you knew a man came on your face
4171000	4172000	But because it's cum
4172000	4173000	The irony has to be there
4173000	4174000	So they're like
4174000	4175000	Oh, it's a bird
4175000	4176000	Oh, these darn birds
4176000	4177000	Which you would never do
4177000	4179000	If a bird shit on your face
4179000	4181000	And it was more like that silent film
4181000	4182000	Like
4183000	4184000	Damn it
4184000	4187000	Whereas if you had a gigantic load like that
4187000	4190000	It would feel like a snowball in your eye
4190000	4191000	And you'd be like
4191000	4192000	What the fuck
4194000	4195000	I want to say
4195000	4196000	I know the actor that it was
4196000	4198000	It wasn't Patrick, was it?
4198000	4200000	I think a friend of mine was in there
4200000	4201000	I can't think of who it was
4201000	4203000	He was the second city actor
4203000	4206000	Who was there in the 70s
4206000	4207000	And he's
4207000	4208000	I'm sorry, I can't think of it
4208000	4211000	But he wrote on Golden Girls with
4211000	4213000	So he was just a guy who was hanging out as an actor
4213000	4214000	And they're like
4214000	4215000	Hey, you want to do that part?
4215000	4216000	He's like
4216000	4217000	All right, fuckers, I'll do it
4217000	4219000	And that's how it happened
4219000	4220000	That's a good story
4220000	4222000	I was the guy that got the jizz on the head
4224000	4227000	And it must have been great to work with Roger Moore
4227000	4230000	Because he's Roger Moore no matter what
4230000	4231000	And he was in that movie
4231000	4233000	Yeah, he has that Bob Saget thing
4233000	4235000	Where he just says filthy things all the time
4235000	4239000	So that you don't think that
4239000	4242000	He's the proper real James Bond
4242000	4243000	Which you and I
4243000	4245000	The joke's on us because
4245000	4249000	We both thought Roger Moore was the real James Bond
4249000	4251000	And then you grow up
4251000	4254000	Now we're looking back through
4254000	4256000	The lens of all of our friends who are like
4256000	4258000	Aggregators of James Bond culture
4258000	4259000	And it's like
4259000	4261000	Oh, Roger Moore was like the Adam West of James Bonds
4261000	4262000	Right, right
4262000	4263000	But you and I were like
4263000	4264000	That's James Bond
4264000	4266000	He was one in space
4266000	4267000	You'd watch the Sean Connery ones
4267000	4268000	And you'd be like
4268000	4271000	Ugh, I can't believe they let this go on long enough to get their act together
4271000	4274000	With a view to a kill
4274000	4277000	Sean Connery's not really funny in those films, right?
4277000	4280000	He's wry
4280000	4283000	The movie's got increasingly campy with Roger Moore's influence
4283000	4286000	And he was the saint, right?
4286000	4287000	Yeah
4287000	4288000	Yeah, I mean that's
4288000	4289000	Roger Moore is like
4289000	4293000	He's the guy who kind of coincided with the gadgets, right?
4293000	4294000	More over
4294000	4296000	They had gadgets in the Sean Connery movie
4296000	4297000	I'm talking to my ass
4297000	4298000	Matt Gorley
4298000	4299000	Well, Matt Gorley is a guest
4299000	4301000	Yeah, there was always gadgets in that bit
4301000	4303000	But they weren't just camp with Connery
4303000	4306000	He cracked a lot of jokes and one-liners
4306000	4308000	And mostly about pussy and stuff
4308000	4309000	Yeah
4309000	4310000	It began with
4310000	4311000	Yeah, you'll eat pussy
4311000	4314000	What was it?
4314000	4315000	I'm pussy galore
4315000	4316000	He goes
4316000	4317000	I noticed
4317000	4319000	Yeah, not
4319000	4320000	How would he notice?
4320000	4321000	That's so clever
4321000	4323000	What was that fucking mean?
4323000	4324000	Also, not even
4324000	4325000	No pussy lips
4325000	4327000	That's sticking out of your box
4327000	4329000	What?
4329000	4333000	You've got an enormous amount of footage
4333000	4336000	You have a truly gigantic pudding
4336000	4338000	The funny thing it would be is that she called him on like
4338000	4339000	Well, that's not very clever
4339000	4342000	And he'd be like, either is your name
4342000	4345000	I'm yes-anding, like, on its level
4345000	4346000	Like, pussy galore
4346000	4347000	Yeah, I noticed
4347000	4351000	Don't make me fucking carry your weight
4351000	4353000	You can't do better than pussy galore
4353000	4355000	And I'm supposed to be like
4355000	4357000	Riddle-diddle-doo
4359000	4361000	I'm supposed to like 23-scadoo
4361000	4363000	Yeah, I'm supposed to either let that pass
4363000	4365000	Or come up with the world's best pussy galore joke
4365000	4366000	Yeah
4366000	4370000	Stop making me the bad guy in this conversation
4370000	4373000	Your name might as well be Bucket Sucka Dick
4376000	4378000	So, yeah, I noticed
4378000	4379000	That's what you get
4379000	4380000	I noticed
4381000	4382000	That's what I've heard
4383000	4385000	My name is Sucka Dick
4385000	4387000	Bucket Sucka Dick
4389000	4390000	Okay
4390000	4391000	Okay, all right
4391000	4392000	My name's James Bond
4392000	4393000	Let's get to work
4393000	4395000	There's the world's at stake
4395000	4396000	First of all
4397000	4399000	Apparently, I don't know why
4399000	4401000	The beginning scenes are always really confusing
4403000	4404000	I did Matt Gorley
4404000	4407000	What's the other guy's name on the podcast, the Bond one
4407000	4408000	I always go, kill me
4408000	4409000	Jeremy Carter
4409000	4410000	No, not Jeremy Carter
4410000	4411000	They do the...
4412000	4413000	Matt Mirrod
4413000	4414000	Matt Mirrod
4414000	4415000	Yeah
4415000	4416000	And we did the podcast
4416000	4417000	And we did Man with the Golden Gun
4417000	4419000	And there was some straight-up woman beating in that movie
4419000	4421000	It takes a really weird turn
4421000	4423000	He just starts boxing this chick around
4423000	4425000	It's like, that's not sexy
4427000	4429000	And yet, just 23 years ago?
4430000	4431000	Super hot
4435000	4436000	Never mind
4437000	4438000	I can't remember
4438000	4439000	And then I'll fumble around for it
4439000	4441000	So, Horatio, the movie is finished
4442000	4444000	How long did it take to shoot the whole thing?
4444000	4445000	Three months
4445000	4446000	Three months
4446000	4448000	And so, was there a big... to do a big screening?
4448000	4449000	A big hoo-ha?
4449000	4451000	Hollywood screening and all that?
4451000	4452000	Yeah, I think there was
4452000	4454000	Like, around 9-11
4454000	4455000	Like, after
4456000	4461000	Like, I think it came out the spring of 2002
4461000	4463000	The world was ready for a laugh at that
4463000	4464000	They wanted it, yeah
4465000	4472000	Did you approve of the idea of having the red carpet go right through Ground Zero?
4475000	4479000	I know a lot of people cited that as, like, one of the things that they were put off by
4479000	4483000	I was like, why does the red carpet have to go through the middle of Ground Zero
4484000	4488000	And then bank back around to a theater, which is, like, a mile away
4488000	4491000	Yeah, they said that we're actually, like, doing construction stuff in there
4491000	4494000	And we're like, please, postpone construction
4494000	4495000	Let us have our premiere
4495000	4497000	This is a celebration of New York
4499000	4503000	You know, this country is the acceptance of the gay human beings
4504000	4508000	And, you know, it was all about, like, yeah, about getting them back
4508000	4510000	Is what I like to say, getting back
4510000	4512000	Dio Sommers that did that to us
4514000	4519000	Can you tell whether or not that movie is homophobic when you watch it through, like, a 2015 lens
4520000	4523000	I can't remember the last time I watched it, but I know it was like
4525000	4531000	Well, the guy who plays a gay guy is just so, like, he's so out of hand gay
4532000	4536000	That he's wearing, like, makeup and just, like, weird
4537000	4541000	Like, if he was doing a space show in the 60s, you know, and that's how gay he is
4542000	4546000	I think I made the exact, I think that's the exact mistake I made on a community episode
4546000	4551000	It was, like, early, like, it was, I can't remember if it was, I think it was season three
4552000	4559000	Yeah, it was, like, we wanted, in our heart we were trying, we wanted to tell a story about, like, worlds coming together
4559000	4564000	And a bigot that stops being a bigot because he actually learns these people are human beings, blah, blah, blah
4564000	4566000	The blah, blah, blah
4569000	4570000	Blah, blah, blah
4570000	4573000	It's the most honest thing I've ever said on this stage
4574000	4578000	Because the truth is, I'm neither of a big nor an advocate
4578000	4581000	I'm just a fucking narcissist, blah, blah, blah
4583000	4587000	That's the only honest thing I've ever said politically on this stage
4587000	4590000	Blah, blah, blah, in reference to an entire, like, movement
4592000	4598000	But the mistake that we made when I didn't even notice we were making it because it's a sitcom
4598000	4602000	And it's a half hour long, it was, like, yeah, the gay people they read as gay
4602000	4606000	And that was the mistake because it was part of the setup in the story sense
4606000	4608000	It was, like, well, once upon a time there was a bigot
4608000	4611000	And the bigot is a cartoon of a bigot because it's a sitcom
4611000	4617000	And then just, you know, it was, like, and what we accidentally did because we weren't even thinking about it
4617000	4622000	We weren't trying to create dimensionalized gay characters on our show
4623000	4628000	We just weren't thinking about that being a failure if we didn't do that
4628000	4631000	Because we were just thinking, we were just playing with tinker toys
4631000	4633000	Oh, here's the bigot and here's the gay guy
4633000	4636000	Wardrobe's here, how should the gay guy dress? Well, guess what?
4638000	4641000	Oh, the casting's here, who should we cast as the gay guy? That guy
4642000	4651000	And it was all in the name of just sort of, like, oh, the story will be effective if the ducks that are teasing the ugly duckling read as ducks
4651000	4654000	And so the beautiful, and the swans read as swans
4654000	4667000	It's hubris, and then what we found out was, like, oh, shit, the offensive thing, I guess, is, like, there's a huge misstep that you could do along the way
4667000	4671000	That you're not even trying to do that actually cuts the same silhouette as bigotry
4671000	4674000	Which is, like, oh, you're just doing a caricature
4674000	4677000	I mean, I don't know why I'm explaining this, everyone understands that part
4678000	4682000	What I'm explaining is that I didn't understand, you know, why I would do that, you know
4682000	4692000	Yeah, well, even as a comedian trying to make fun of gay people, for just funny things that they do, you have to be very careful
4692000	4701000	You can't just say, so I think the mistake is that if you, we see the old caricature of a gay person on TV in the 70s
4701000	4706000	Which was, like, completely flaming, shirt open, pink, you know, gold shoes
4706000	4711000	And then we'll think, we're gonna make fun of that by making that even more ridiculous
4711000	4716000	I think that's another mistake people make, is just making it super gay
4716000	4720000	Because, see, we know it's a joke, but in the same breath, you have this caricature
4720000	4727000	Yeah, the idea of that, I mean, I think, yeah, the mistake is, like, and that I realize now is that, oh, you have to write up to every character
4727000	4729000	And I don't know why I would violate that rule
4730000	4737000	Chevy Chase's character was, like, he was, to me, he's cartoonish because he's this, you know, he's this crazy character
4737000	4740000	But I'm also always writing up to that character
4740000	4745000	And if a gay guy is, like, walking through the frame and he has five seconds to be gay and set up a story point
4745000	4753000	Like, the challenge is on me, like, to construct a story where, because if anybody's watching straight or gay
4753000	4762000	They're, like, they're, it's actually, I think, I guess, I guess, I'd summarize the mistake as being, like, writers tend to, uh
4762000	4768000	We tend to, we forget that the whole goal is immersification
4768000	4774000	Whether or not it's silliness or, like, however ridiculous the joke is or whatever
4774000	4778000	If it's in the medium of people watching it and listening to it
4779000	4783000	Like, your end goal is that they believe it's real, kind of
4783000	4785000	Even a pie fight
4785000	4788000	So it's, like, that's funny that it's a pie fight because why would people fight with pies
4788000	4791000	So I believe they're people and I believe those are pies
4791000	4797000	Like, and so if you're, it's dangerous to, like, do social commentary of any kind
4797000	4805000	Like, you have to rise up to that because now you're using people and groups of people as pies in a pie fight
4805000	4809000	And you have to, like, no, no, no, that needs to read as, like, actual believable meringue
4809000	4814000	Or you're gonna make people, cause, cause, cause, cause, like, they can see the tin hit the face
4814000	4817000	And, like, those pie fight scenes, like, now I love my metaphor
4817000	4821000	Cause they're, like, when it's, like, clearly just fucking whipped topping in a fucking pie plate
4821000	4823000	I hate when the pie fight's just a bunch of whipped cream
4823000	4825000	Come on, I was like
4825000	4827000	That's, that's not a dish
4827000	4829000	Or shaving cream, even worse
4829000	4831000	When you make shaving cream
4831000	4833000	And how much funnier is it to get hit with a real pie
4833000	4837000	And how much funnier maybe would've, you know, there's a, there's nothing wrong with the concept of
4837000	4842000	But there's nothing inherently offensive about, about, about that idea at all
4842000	4846000	It would be, it could be, like, a masterpiece of whatever
4846000	4848000	You could say that about anything, you could say that about it
4848000	4853000	Was there any backlash or, like, any reaction, Horatio, from gay community about Boat Trip?
4853000	4855000	Um
4855000	4857000	I mean, I mean, positive or negative or indifferent?
4857000	4862000	I don't think, I don't think they, I don't know, maybe, but I, I, I don't remember
4862000	4864000	It's never, like, a big stink of, you know
4864000	4866000	No, because the heart was in the right place
4870000	4872000	My character learned that gay people were human
4872000	4873000	Yeah
4873000	4874000	Right
4874000	4878000	How does your, what, what was your character, how does your character's arc end? Does he, does he come out as gay?
4878000	4880000	Or does he just, uh, accept the
4880000	4882000	I accept gays
4882000	4890000	And I think, and I end up hooking up with this, uh, this woman who lives in, uh, in, in the hills in Sweden
4891000	4896000	Uh, I find her and she's, uh, some sexy thing that for some reason was, was there
4896000	4899000	So I end up, it ends up okay for me
4901000	4904000	And in some indirect way, that's a, that's a reward for you accepting gays
4904000	4907000	Is that you get to have a pure form of heterosexuality
4907000	4909000	Exactly, yeah, uh, yeah
4909000	4913000	Cause there's, like, some kind of Swedish bikini team or something, like, literally lands on the boat or something
4913000	4916000	Yeah, no, no, I, I shoot down a helicopter
4917000	4918000	Um
4918000	4919000	With your cum
4920000	4921000	My cum
4922000	4926000	The whole super-cum is explained in the first five minutes of the movie
4926000	4933000	Cuba and I eat these weird, these weird, these weird donuts that have this stuff that we get super-cum
4933000	4935000	That's why this, no
4937000	4939000	Wait, where was I?
4939000	4941000	Well, you were shooting down a helicopter
4941000	4942000	You shot down a helicopter
4942000	4943000	Oh, I shot down a hel-
4943000	4945000	I had forgotten that I shot this scene
4945000	4949000	So when I saw this, I got really high and saw this movie like two years later after I made it
4949000	4951000	And I'm like, what?
4954000	4957000	I shoot down a helicopter with a flare gun?
4958000	4963000	Holy shit, I remember having to act like, okay, the helicopter's falling
4963000	4967000	There's, uh, there's nine models inside the plane
4967000	4969000	The helicopter you just shot down
4969000	4971000	So you don't know what you're gonna do
4971000	4973000	You're gonna get some help, or you're gonna jump in the water
4973000	4977000	And it was, uh, yeah, I just, uh, it hit me pretty, pretty hard
4977000	4983000	And I, I, I'd shot down a helicopter in this comedy that we had made
4984000	4986000	That was the bridge too far for you in that movie?
4986000	4993000	Yeah, yeah, I mean, if you watch that, all believability goes out the window right there on the-
4993000	4994000	There are some little suits
4994000	4997000	If there was really at the edge of their seats, they're like, wow, I hope these guys figure it out
4997000	4999000	And then after that, they're like, oh, what the hell?
5000000	5002000	These guys are jokers
5003000	5009000	So, so nowadays, and I guess this is where, if, if it was like a single camera production, it would fade down
5009000	5012000	And the Chiron would say, life after boat trip
5012000	5016000	Now we talk about, uh, current things
5016000	5018000	I don't, I thought that would be funnier
5021000	5027000	It's like there would be piano keys playing, like, after, after the boat trip
5028000	5033000	It's like that, that Leaf Garrett interview from Hollywood, E! True Hollywood story
5034000	5035000	You guys know about Leaf Garrett?
5035000	5042000	He, he got drunk and, uh, and then him and his buddy got in the car wreck and, uh, his buddy's paralyzed
5042000	5043000	Right, oh, and he-
5043000	5045000	And so, and so then he, he talks about it
5045000	5048000	And he's like, I'm like, Paulie, I'm sorry, man
5049000	5050000	Never forgive me
5050000	5052000	And then Paulie comes out and forgives him, but
5053000	5058000	He looked so fucked up from, like, the days when he was a teen idol
5058000	5064000	And then, like, he had, like, a bandana covering because his hair was, like, probably half of it was gone
5064000	5066000	Or had been shaved by somebody
5066000	5067000	Yeah, he's pretty bald
5067000	5068000	Yeah
5068000	5070000	So, so, yeah, that's that moment right now
5070000	5071000	What I'm talking about
5071000	5074000	Why would someone just shave his hair? I mean, it was probably, it probably fell out, right?
5074000	5078000	Well, shave, like, like, shave, like, like, you're drugged out and someone's like
5078000	5081000	Pay me my money, or I'm gonna shave after that
5081000	5084000	You think he was wearing it, like, uh, you thought maybe-
5084000	5088000	Because as soon as I saw that, I was like, oh, it's just traditional, like, like, the guy from Poison, whatever
5088000	5092000	You know, it's like that bandana thing, it's just, like, like, the weirdest impulses
5092000	5097000	Wait, can I get your take on Trump's hair? Because I was researching today
5097000	5102000	I know it's a hack topic, but honestly, the more I read about it, the more I'm confused
5102000	5106000	Like, that there's actually no consensus about what is going on
5106000	5111000	My theory is that he has some strands in the back, maybe, that he kind of, like-
5111000	5112000	Swirls?
5112000	5114000	Swirls around, yeah
5114000	5119000	Uh, if not, you know, he might have a wig, but, um, at this point
5119000	5125000	At this point, probably, it started as a swirl, now it's maybe a wig that looks just like it
5125000	5126000	Huh
5126000	5127000	That's an interesting- Okay
5127000	5130000	That's similar to the double comb-over theory, right?
5130000	5133000	Yeah, I mean, I always- I always thought it was, like, accepted theory
5133000	5140000	That I was always kind of boggled by, that it was a double comb-over, that it was from the side
5140000	5143000	Like, a traditional one, and then, I guess, from the back?
5143000	5145000	Like, he has, like, riff-raff from-
5145000	5147000	So it's like two weather forces coming together
5147000	5150000	And that's why it looks kind of like a basket, like, if you look closely
5150000	5151000	Yeah, yeah
5152000	5156000	But it all flies up as one, if the wind touches it
5156000	5159000	But he's not bald underneath that
5159000	5163000	I know, that as far as I can tell, um, I don't know, I was researching it today
5163000	5167000	Because now I really want to know, because, of course, he's our next commander-in-chief
5167000	5172000	And, uh, watch out, Ireland, because-
5172000	5175000	I love the idea that people in Ireland are, like, I don't know if you heard that
5175000	5181000	My wife's in Ireland, and they're, like, the people she's talking to, the big thing that they keep coming back to
5181000	5184000	Is, like, is- I can't do an Irish accent, but-
5184000	5186000	Give her a try, give her a try
5186000	5188000	And then he tried
5189000	5191000	Is Donald Trump going to win?
5191000	5194000	Like, they're really- I guess that-
5194000	5199000	I guess we feel like those days are now- have been here and have gone
5199000	5203000	That idea that the world is worried that a maniac will be president of America
5203000	5207000	I was like, have they been paying attention for 38 years?
5207000	5210000	Like, what's their worst case scenario?
5210000	5215000	You know, do they really think there's still a button that works that's gonna nuke Ireland?
5215000	5218000	Like, I guess we have some more realistic fear having to do with what?
5218000	5221000	Our ability to collapse the entire world's economy?
5221000	5223000	Been there, done that?
5223000	5227000	I don't want Donald Trump to be president, but who gives a fuck?
5227000	5233000	Like, what would be the big difference between that and a fire hydrant behind that desk?
5233000	5238000	Outside of Supreme Court appointments, which Jeff's point is very well taken
5238000	5244000	This next election is kind of important in a bipartisan sense that the Supreme Court justices are gonna get picked
5244000	5250000	Because now when your friends- you want to vote for Bernie Sanders right now
5250000	5254000	And now, over the next year, your friends are gonna slowly, one by one, they're gonna turn
5254000	5257000	And they're gonna start Ralph Nader-ing you
5257000	5260000	You don't know what that means because you're 25
5260000	5263000	It hurts
5263000	5265000	I have bad memories
5265000	5268000	Ross Perot, 92
5268000	5275000	Your friends are gonna change from third party advocates to fascist, fucking bipartisan little robots
5275000	5277000	Because they're gonna go, you're splitting them up
5277000	5279000	You vote for him, you're voting for the bing, bing, bing
5279000	5281000	You vote, you might as well vote
5281000	5285000	And this isn't a female character, this is a male
5285000	5288000	I'm not sexist
5288000	5291000	And that was a difference in the election, right?
5291000	5295000	It sounded a little bit like Tay Brixton
5296000	5299000	Wait, we don't have time to explain that
5301000	5306000	Alright, well, we usually give our guests two choices
5306000	5310000	You can either have a double gulp or- no
5310000	5315000	You can- why do I give them a choice because that puts them on the spot
5315000	5317000	That's too late
5317000	5322000	You can stay and we're gonna play a role-playing game called Shadowrun
5322000	5325000	Where you play a character, you don't have to know anything about it
5325000	5328000	You're just gonna be a guy in the far future
5328000	5330000	It's like a cyberpunk kind of world
5330000	5335000	We usually get about two feet of movement accomplished
5335000	5338000	What it really amounts to is a half hour of your time
5338000	5341000	Not anything other than that
5341000	5344000	Or you can leave, and we can plug whatever you want to plug
5344000	5346000	No, no, hang on
5346000	5351000	Let's bring out Demorge Brown
5351000	5353000	Let's bring out Demorge
5365000	5372000	I don't know if I'm reading this accurately, but I feel like there was audible reaction to Demorge's sexy shirt
5376000	5378000	Sometimes he shops
5378000	5380000	Bachelor number one
5384000	5387000	That shirt is fucking legit, man
5387000	5392000	Every once in a while I go shopping and I go, that piece of whatever that is
5392000	5395000	I couldn't pull that off, but you look great and that's a good thing for you
5395000	5399000	This will only make four people laugh that are not even in the audience, they're watching on their laptops
5399000	5405000	When you pick that shirt in Borderlands 2, the video game, it's called Clever Girl
5407000	5409000	That's the title of the shirt
5409000	5413000	There's different armors in the game and they all have themes
5413000	5419000	And it looks like a Jurassic camouflage
5419000	5421000	Clever Girl would be
5423000	5426000	So that wasn't a real Borderlands 2 skin
5426000	5433000	You're using Borderlands 2 as a springboard to make a Jurassic Park clothing joke
5433000	5435000	Yeah, yeah, yeah
5435000	5439000	See, again, it's like the Philharmonic thing, I'm still bothered by that
5439000	5445000	Well, you know what, guess what? I'm not a professional entertainer, he got part of my ABC sitcom
5445000	5450000	I'm not a fucking entertainer, I told you, I saw him, I was like, oh great, I'm fucked
5450000	5453000	Guys, guys, guys, please, it's just the shirt
5453000	5457000	And I'm happy Boat Trip made you sad
5457000	5461000	Because you know what, you made me sad
5461000	5464000	You took my acting away
5464000	5467000	That's why I'm here
5467000	5472000	That's why you choked on your power
5472000	5477000	I hate our audience sometimes because they're so nice
5477000	5481000	And then they ruin jokes sometimes by doing that awe
5481000	5485000	And it makes me, you know, yeah
5485000	5488000	How weird that you can conjure it artificially
5488000	5492000	It's almost as if it means nothing when it happens
5493000	5495000	Every fucking time
5495000	5498000	Yeah, the awe is hard to come back from
5498000	5500000	The awe
5500000	5502000	You can still kind of
5502000	5505000	Yeah, you can still rescue that one
5505000	5509000	Well, I've learned from it, like when they go, oh
5509000	5512000	It's usually because, like, you said like
5512000	5515000	I'm not being condescending
5516000	5519000	Everyone in the audience is a genius
5519000	5523000	The audiences can be delightfully stupid because they're acting as one
5523000	5525000	That's what you want them to do
5527000	5529000	See, that guy's a genius
5529000	5532000	If they all went, yup, that would be weird
5537000	5541000	If you react by apologizing, which is what I always do
5541000	5544000	Or like backpedaling or arguing
5544000	5546000	They smell blood, right?
5546000	5549000	Isn't that the idea? You're not supposed to show fear
5549000	5553000	If you go, like, hey, there's a spaghetti, and then the N word
5553000	5555000	And then they go, whoa
5555000	5557000	And then you're just supposed to go
5557000	5558000	What are you supposed to do?
5558000	5561000	Like, Greg Croubs goes, walk it off, fuck faces
5561000	5563000	And then he just keeps moving
5563000	5565000	We were in Yakima, Washington
5565000	5567000	Have I told the story before?
5567000	5569000	Well, maybe to me
5570000	5573000	We were doing an improv show with, like, you know, the Who's Line guys
5573000	5576000	Me and Ryan Stiles and Chip Essen probably
5576000	5579000	And we were in Yakima, and Greg's coming out there
5579000	5582000	Does the intro, and he's explaining how improv works for people that don't know
5582000	5584000	He's like, we're going to come to you for our suggestions
5584000	5586000	So if I ask you for a name of a writer, sir, you might say this
5586000	5589000	And if I ask you for a name of a thing, madam, you might say that
5589000	5592000	And he said, and if you, sir, if I was to say
5592000	5594000	Give me an activity that you would do around the crib
5594000	5597000	And the guy just kind of looks at me and goes, oh, I'm sorry, I forget where we are
5598000	5601000	Let's say, slang term for your domicile, like, where you live
5601000	5605000	Name an activity that you would do around the trailer
5605000	5607000	And the crowd went, oh!
5607000	5610000	And Greg just goes, walk it off, Yakima
5614000	5616000	Yeah, I don't know, I'm not that
5616000	5617000	It's Yakima
5617000	5618000	I'm not the walk it off Yakima kind of guy
5618000	5621000	Now, you're like, Greg can get away with paddling the audience and they kind of like it
5621000	5622000	But you have to
5622000	5625000	You know, I like to think, I like to think
5625000	5629000	I really like to think, and don't we all like to think a bunch of dumb shit, that's not true
5629000	5633000	I like to think that the audience is endeared by my tendency to then go
5633000	5635000	Well, wait, wait, wait, I didn't mean it that way
5635000	5638000	You know, because I didn't
5638000	5641000	But then I'm also mad at them sometimes for going on
5641000	5643000	Because they didn't even mean that
5643000	5645000	It's weird how we do have a tendency to like
5645000	5647000	I notice one time, here's a weird thing
5647000	5650000	There's a legal term, silence is consent
5650000	5653000	But the word consent has taken on this
5653000	5656000	You know, really, really powerful, sizzling meaning
5656000	5658000	Really specific contents
5658000	5661000	But I remember two times in this podcast
5661000	5664000	Before I ever figured that out, I used the term silence as consent
5664000	5667000	Which is more of a reference to this legal
5667000	5671000	Like, I was saying, meaning in the larger legal sense
5671000	5673000	That if you don't do, or philosophical sense
5673000	5675000	If you don't do something about something, then it's
5675000	5678000	You're not, you don't get a pass necessarily
5678000	5681000	But I think it's because of the word consent
5681000	5683000	Both times, if you go back through the archives
5683000	5685000	Like, I go, silence is consent
5685000	5687000	And then I hear people go like
5687000	5689000	Like an audible response from the crowd as one
5689000	5691000	Go like, ohh
5691000	5693000	I was like, no, that's not
5693000	5696000	You, the word, because it's because of the word consent
5696000	5699000	Became part of a different family of language
5699000	5700000	Recently
5700000	5702000	Well, yeah, you're saying that
5702000	5705000	Date rape's okay as long as you don't talk
5705000	5708000	As long as no one talks, it's all good
5708000	5711000	Yeah, the phrase silence is consent
5711000	5716000	Applied to our current conversations about consent
5716000	5719000	Not a great idea
5719000	5722000	Like, but it's old
5722000	5724000	It's like platonic or something
5724000	5728000	It's like, it's a concept
5731000	5733000	I think we got to the bottom of that
5733000	5735000	And then also, you know what I don't like?
5735000	5737000	They're silence
5737000	5740000	Why aren't they always laughing?
5740000	5742000	Or applauding, or saying, I love you
5742000	5745000	You just spent the last 15 minutes taking the big shit on them
5745000	5750000	Why do they always have to either be quiet or reacting the way I don't want them to?
5750000	5755000	Why can't they just react the way I want them to react?
5755000	5761000	My name is...Slam Charisma
5761000	5765000	See, I kind of feel bad because the stupidest thing is like
5765000	5768000	Barton made that terrific noise earlier on
5768000	5772000	Horatio, are you aware of Barton's awesome magical laugh?
5772000	5774000	No, no
5774000	5776000	Can you manufacture it?
5776000	5779000	Can I cue you and can you kind of do a fake version of it?
5779000	5783000	Tell me Garbanzo being joked in
5783000	5785000	Okay, okay
5785000	5789000	What's the difference between a Garbanzo bean and a chickpea?
5790000	5794000	He doesn't even...he can't even wait for the punch line
5802000	5806000	It's like Glenda the Good Witch walking in on you while you're taking a shit
5812000	5814000	You're like the world's happiest ghost
5814000	5821000	Did you ever heard that before, Horatio?
5821000	5823000	You work with Barton, right?
5823000	5826000	No, I don't. I've never heard him laugh
5828000	5831000	Oh, you called in. Okay. Well, thank you
5839000	5841000	What's the difference?
5842000	5848000	I thought they were being...I thought they were being way gratuitously like labor law
5848000	5855000	Because he was like, I called in and you're like, oh, you called in and you're like, what's the difference, Horatio?
5859000	5862000	Sorry, I guess, I guess
5862000	5864000	Am I not a kisser to you?
5864000	5867000	Call, but he was a guest and I didn't say anything about it, sorry
5867000	5870000	I'm just a fucking animal because I'm on a phone
5871000	5873000	The opposite should be true
5873000	5877000	You could have an animal on your shirt and Johnny Carson ever have a chimp call in?
5877000	5880000	I can't name the times he had one right on
5880000	5884000	On a tricycle, dressed as a pirate
5884000	5887000	For some reason, I guess because...
5887000	5891000	Dan, what's the difference between a Garbanzo bean and a chickpea?
5891000	5894000	The difference between a Garbanzo...
5894000	5896000	He can't just say that to you
5896000	5899000	Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Just fucking stop it because you're part of the problem
5899000	5901000	We're in New York
5901000	5904000	I told this joke on... Did we talk about this last time?
5904000	5908000	When we were shooting this little pilot that Dan and Dino were doing
5908000	5915000	We were kind of like just joking with the audience, kind of keeping it warm between the stuff
5915000	5919000	And I went out and told this Garbanzo bean joke and I got this big laugh
5919000	5922000	And then Dino was just drunk, drunk
5922000	5927000	Comes like stinking drunk, comes running up in front of the cameras with a script in his hand
5927000	5930000	No, no, no, you fucked it up, you told it wrong, you told it wrong
5930000	5933000	And he tells me the joke completely wrong in my ear
5933000	5936000	And the whole audience just got it and totally loved it
5936000	5939000	And then the next day we were laughing about that, we sat at a bar
5939000	5941000	And I said, Dan, try to tell the joke
5941000	5945000	And I'm... How long? 15, 20 minutes?
5945000	5949000	Yeah, so now should we tell him what the joke is?
5949000	5952000	Tell him the joke and then I'm going to tell him how you started your version
5952000	5956000	Okay, so should I be the one to try to tell him the Garbanzo bean joke?
5956000	5957000	Right now?
5957000	5958000	I think I can do it
5958000	5959000	Do it
5959000	5960000	Okay
5960000	5962000	Take two lines, take it from the top
5962000	5964000	Martin, get ready with your laugh
5964000	5966000	Do you understand that you've never done this under this kind of pressure?
5966000	5967000	Yeah
5967000	5970000	I'm bad at telling jokes, is the big joke
5970000	5972000	Me too
5974000	5978000	Whoa, whoa, you just talk shit about Oz
5978000	5981000	You fucking awe him
5981000	5983000	That was a very different kind of Oz
5983000	5985000	How do we know? What's the difference?
5985000	5987000	That was a...
5987000	5989000	Now we're just...
5992000	5994000	Alright, alright
5996000	6000000	What's the difference between a Garbanzo bean and a chickpea?
6000000	6001000	What?
6001000	6005000	I don't pay $200 to have a Garbanzo bean in my mouth
6005000	6015000	That a boy
6019000	6022000	Time flies like a soup, a banana flies like an arrow
6022000	6024000	Okay, so...
6024000	6027000	Time flies like an arrow, but fruit flies like a banana
6027000	6031000	Yeah, I'm sure all these jokes have their little codes
6032000	6035000	It's called the order of the words to make them funny
6035000	6036000	Okay
6036000	6039000	So Dan, so we're doing it and we're like, Dan, try to tell the joke
6039000	6041000	And we're at this bar in the afternoon
6041000	6043000	They're getting ready to leave town
6043000	6045000	And Dan goes, okay, okay, okay, I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it
6045000	6047000	Alright, so, alright
6047000	6051000	Again, to emphasize the irony is that we're mocking Dino
6051000	6054000	Because Dino got the joke wrong, you know, like
6054000	6057000	He comes up to my ear and he goes, no, no, no, no, no, no
6057000	6059000	It has to be a girl Garbanzo bean
6059000	6062000	Yeah, that's just crazy
6062000	6064000	So that's what we were laughing about
6064000	6068000	Here's a little fun fact, he told me this joke
6068000	6073000	So even though he heard the laugh, he heard the joke where he came up
6073000	6075000	So we're mocking Dino for making that decision
6075000	6076000	We're like, what are you doing with it?
6076000	6078000	And then Jeff has to...
6078000	6080000	I love watching Dan try to tell a joke
6080000	6082000	And so he goes, okay, alright, so
6082000	6086000	A guy walks into a prostitute's office
6086000	6088000	And I really thought that's the thing
6088000	6092000	A prostitute's office
6092000	6094000	I forgot that there was such a thing as...
6094000	6099000	And he said, I would like a sexual encounter with...
6099000	6101000	With a lagoon or...
6101000	6104000	What kind of beans do you have, guys?
6104000	6106000	I know that there's two beans
6106000	6109000	Okay, so we're like, a prostitute's office
6109000	6111000	I guess, okay, office isn't important
6111000	6114000	There's a guy, he's in a desert
6115000	6117000	And he walks up to another guy
6117000	6120000	And the guy says, I have two kinds of beans
6120000	6123000	I go, Dan, this is a two-line joke
6123000	6125000	You're like, fuck, fuck, fuck
6125000	6128000	And so you tried forever and ever and ever and ever
6128000	6130000	How can you be a two-line joke?
6130000	6131000	How can I be a two-line joke?
6131000	6133000	And the answer is because you're the guy
6133000	6135000	I forgot that that's possible in a joke
6135000	6137000	You could just be the guy
6137000	6140000	So he finally gives up and he goes, okay, how does the guy go
6140000	6141000	What's the difference?
6141000	6143000	And you fucking died, I guess
6143000	6144000	It's a riddle
6144000	6145000	Yeah, it's a riddle
6145000	6148000	What have I got in my pockets?
6148000	6150000	Which, by the way, I'm sure we all agree
6150000	6153000	Bilbo's being kind of an asshole
6153000	6155000	Right, in that riddle competition
6155000	6158000	Yeah, he definitely cheated
6158000	6159000	What have I got in my pocket?
6159000	6161000	It's not a riddle
6163000	6165000	And, you know, on another episode
6165000	6168000	And please tell your friends to come for when we talk about it
6168000	6171000	I'd really like to talk about, you know, what goes into
6171000	6174000	When does Sauron decide that a ring gets to get lost?
6174000	6175000	It's fucking dumb
6175000	6176000	Oh, yeah
6176000	6180000	Just decide that the ring can roll down a hill and take over the world, then
6183000	6186000	I don't like the magic in the Tolkien universe
6186000	6188000	Yeah
6188000	6191000	We don't like the magic in the Tolkien universe
6191000	6194000	We think it's too spiritual and not rule-driven enough
6194000	6196000	It's plot magic
6196000	6197000	You know what's exciting?
6197000	6198000	Jackie Chan beating someone up
6198000	6199000	You know why?
6199000	6201000	Because you can see what the rules of a shopping cart are
6201000	6204000	And why it's weird to use it as a weapon
6205000	6208000	And if two old guys are fighting with spells
6208000	6212000	It's like I want to know what their mana levels are depleted
6212000	6214000	You know, and what's the rules, you know?
6214000	6217000	Like, knock, knock, who's there?
6217000	6219000	And then it's like, weren't you glad I didn't say banana?
6219000	6220000	And you're like, that's clever
6220000	6223000	He did magic better than the other guy
6223000	6224000	Or he knows more spells
6224000	6227000	Or he had a secret spell button in his pocket
6227000	6232000	Just give me the, give me the, give me the shit that I came for, Tolkien
6232000	6238000	You'll never defeat me, Soromon, for I have a magical spell button in my pocket
6240000	6241000	Is it nice?
6241000	6243000	I think it's funny
6246000	6250000	Now, a single person in this room has reacted to me the right way tonight
6251000	6253000	Except for Barton, Barton
6257000	6265000	I just, I just, I just turn into, I don't know, Charlie Rose
6265000	6268000	What would I, what would I turn into if you melted my evil away?
6270000	6271000	I don't know
6271000	6272000	John Stewart
6273000	6275000	Just a beautiful little baby
6276000	6277000	I am a
6279000	6280000	I'm a
6280000	6281000	Freak out
6283000	6284000	Freak out
6284000	6289000	I'm a big, ugly baby, I think there would be a handsome, efficient skeleton underneath me
6289000	6296000	If all of my bad qualities melted away, there'd be a little tiny, like, one of those Day of the Dead Mexican skeletons
6297000	6298000	Like, Fandango
6298000	6301000	I think if you stripped away all the stuff, all the exteriors
6301000	6302000	Fandango
6302000	6305000	What we've come to recognize is because you're excited that you'd just be made of all kwatos
6306000	6309000	You'd just be a lot of little, a lot of little mini kwatos over there
6309000	6310000	Alright
6310000	6313000	Well, I guess the title of tonight's show is bullying
6315000	6316000	Just finding
6317000	6320000	Yeah, well, you know, there's that way, you can do it that way
6322000	6323000	I'm not stupid
6324000	6326000	I know the different kinds of punches
6326000	6329000	From the, I'm not touching you, uh
6330000	6333000	All the way to the, to the, oh, poor baby
6333000	6334000	They're all punches
6334000	6336000	The old soft bow
6336000	6338000	I don't know if you guys have heard this term, microaggression
6340000	6341000	That's you guys
6342000	6343000	Constantly
6343000	6345000	You're a macroaggression
6345000	6347000	Of little microaggressions
6350000	6352000	Yeah, I hope, I hope you're expressing real pain
6354000	6356000	I meant, I meant it to hurt
6356000	6357000	Bad people
6359000	6361000	Alright, what do we, what do we, what do we
6361000	6362000	Let's play some shadow right now
6362000	6363000	Sorry, Horatio
6367000	6372000	By the way, if you do, if you do come and join the Feral Audio family, we'd love to have you back
6372000	6374000	You don't have to, that's not conditional
6374000	6379000	You can come back regardless of business decisions
6379000	6380000	Okay, thank you
6380000	6381000	Here we go again
6381000	6387000	We'd like to have you back and we'd like you to join the Feral Audio family and listen to your podcast
6387000	6389000	Horatio
6390000	6391000	Alright
6393000	6395000	And Demarge, you know, keep coming
6397000	6400000	Oh, do we know, do we want to bring anybody else up?
6400000	6401000	Um, we could
6401000	6403000	You know, actually, we want to get a...
6403000	6405000	How are we doing, like, headcount-wise?
6405000	6406000	I mean, I can never remember
6406000	6408000	I'm always, I'm always fine
6408000	6411000	I know you are, but sometimes that seems passive-aggressive
6411000	6415000	Well, you know, I think that's your projection, you know, that's just, uh
6415000	6416000	Well, I think that's easy to say
6416000	6418000	That's your, your dream or whatever
6418000	6419000	I think you're...
6419000	6420000	Four agreements
6421000	6423000	Callie, you want to come up?
6423000	6427000	Can we, let's get Callie Kazoo, the woman who made the music that you've been hearing all night long
6427000	6428000	Oh
6430000	6432000	Callie Fonteccio
6433000	6435000	What's the name of the new record again, Callie?
6435000	6437000	Contrary to popular belief
6437000	6440000	And where can these people listen to that and purchase it?
6440000	6442000	On my band camp
6443000	6446000	CallieKazoo.bandcamp.com
6446000	6447000	Alright
6447000	6450000	You kids are living in a world of more dots now
6450000	6451000	That's the big thing
6451000	6453000	You guys got more dots now
6454000	6457000	Also, I don't know if we ever really set the record straight
6457000	6461000	I think we were talking about the Mickey Mouse hands
6461000	6464000	I think we kind of made you sound racist for me when we talked about that
6464000	6466000	You misquoted me
6466000	6468000	I mean, you kind of said it, but then you...
6468000	6469000	I just completely forgot what you said
6469000	6470000	You back stepped
6470000	6472000	You guys were talking about cartoon gloves
6472000	6474000	I'm an animator, by the way
6474000	6475000	Yay!
6478000	6483000	So, I told Jeff when we were at the Renaissance Fair, of all places
6483000	6491000	That cartoon gloves kind of have a history of being based off of what was one of the most popular forms of comedy
6491000	6493000	Long ago, which was Minstrel!
6493000	6494000	Minstrel!
6494000	6495000	No, I'm sorry!
6495000	6497000	You were right next to me
6497000	6498000	Here we go
6498000	6500000	Minstrel!
6500000	6501000	Minstrel shows
6501000	6503000	So like Mickey Mouse
6505000	6509000	Mickey Mouse and lots of other characters had white cartoon gloves
6509000	6513000	Which also served the purpose is in black and white and it's a contrast thing
6513000	6515000	I mean, sometimes they didn't have gloves
6515000	6517000	But like, yeah, it's a Minstrel show thing
6517000	6518000	Really?
6518000	6519000	Yeah
6519000	6521000	And Minstrel shows, they had it so
6521000	6525000	Because, you know, people from far away could see what they were, you know, doing
6525000	6528000	And also there'd be stakes
6528000	6530000	Jesus, there's a black guy in here
6531000	6535000	I mean, if you watch the early Mickey Mouse cartoons, I mean, they're kind of inferring
6535000	6538000	He's a certain
6538000	6539000	He's black?
6539000	6541000	Wait, really? They're implying Mickey Mouse is black?
6541000	6542000	Yeah, no, no, no
6542000	6547000	I mean, they're sort of implying some kind of like, racist things
6547000	6551000	Like, he's like, you know, getting drunk or doing whatever kind of crazy things
6551000	6553000	They're kind of inferring
6553000	6555000	Goofy's black
6555000	6557000	Yeah, and Goofy
6557000	6558000	Goofy's black?
6558000	6561000	Or Dippy Dog, which is his original name
6561000	6562000	Yeah
6562000	6564000	I mean, there was a lot of that in cartoons
6564000	6565000	I mean, there was just a lot of that in comics
6565000	6568000	Like, active trickster figures and there was this idea that you could
6568000	6571000	When you wanted them to not play to that effect
6571000	6574000	You could do certain things to make them not play to that effect
6574000	6576000	Or surround them with situations so they didn't
6576000	6578000	But then they did a lot of also like, sort of
6578000	6580000	You can't get mad at a cartoon
6580000	6581000	Yeah
6581000	6582000	Everybody else would just go crazy
6582000	6585000	And so they would throw the book at him and let him do a whole bunch of crazy shit
6586000	6590000	But yeah, no, I mean, it was a different time then
6590000	6593000	If you guys want to see some real racist shit
6593000	6596000	Check out the 11 band cartoons
6596000	6600000	That shit's crazy, like, Cold Black and De7e Dwarves
6600000	6601000	Oh, yeah
6601000	6606000	I went down a rabbit hole and watched a bunch of old little rascals
6606000	6608000	And some of those are shocking
6608000	6611000	Have you seen the one where they put on a play in his Uncle Tom's cabin
6611000	6612000	Including the whipping scene?
6612000	6613000	Oh, yeah
6614000	6615000	We watched that
6615000	6616000	That was crazy
6616000	6617000	At Rob's place
6617000	6618000	Did we?
6618000	6619000	Yeah, Medina
6619000	6620000	Yeah, right
6620000	6621000	Wow
6621000	6623000	Okay, so, speaking of progress
6626000	6630000	Because the show isn't sexist
6630000	6634000	We let the lady choose which character she wants to play
6634000	6637000	Even though they're not both female characters
6637000	6638000	Nailed it
6639000	6646000	It's a combination of chivalry and total fucking, like, post-feminist
6647000	6651000	Ladies first, do you want to play a dude or a girl?
6651000	6653000	I'll be Aaron's character
6653000	6654000	Okay
6654000	6655000	I like what Aaron started
6655000	6656000	Thank you
6656000	6658000	This is going to be a great 10 minutes there
6658000	6661000	You're the character created by Kumail Nanjiani
6661000	6664000	Is that Dr. Friend? I can't even keep track now
6664000	6665000	Yeah
6665000	6666000	Okay, yeah
6666000	6670000	This is like Dungeons and Dragons ratio, except in the future
6670000	6675000	And so you're a troll doctor who's, you know, is going to let a troubled past
6675000	6679000	If that doesn't make sense to you, those papers, don't worry about it
6679000	6680000	Yeah
6680000	6682000	Doesn't make sense to anybody else
6682000	6684000	All right, time's a-wasting, so let's start this off
6684000	6686000	I lost my Shadowrun music somehow, my old playlist
6686000	6689000	We're going to go back to the old days of the D&D spend
6689000	6694000	So there's a recap in the beginning, and maybe your training will let you listen better than I do
6694000	6696000	This one was by Richard Clark
6724000	6725000	Probably not
6755000	6757000	Thank you, Spencer
6757000	6758000	Thank you
6760000	6761000	All right, are all the-
6761000	6762000	I never listened to that
6762000	6763000	Richard Clark
6763000	6764000	Richard Clark, fake name
6764000	6765000	Thanks, Richard
6765000	6768000	Um, did we kill all the trolls?
6768000	6769000	Uh, ghouls
6769000	6770000	Ghouls, like ghouls
6770000	6774000	No, no, you killed about four of them, most of them ran away
6774000	6775000	Right, so how many we got left?
6775000	6779000	Uh, you know, none
6779000	6782000	I mean, there's none in your immediate area other than the one you just stunned
6782000	6790000	You guys were more recently occupied with, uh, casting a group agony spell on a car
6790000	6791000	Oh, that's right
6793000	6794000	Yeah, I forgot about that
6794000	6796000	So, Richard, Richard kind of-
6796000	6800000	Oh, yeah, no, I mean, nothing happened that episode, so I used the last one
6800000	6801000	Oh
6801000	6802000	Yeah
6802000	6803000	All right
6803000	6805000	And then they cast agony on a car
6805000	6806000	Okay, so
6806000	6807000	Shadowrun
6807000	6809000	We gotta find that Johnson, you screwed this over
6809000	6811000	He gave us a troll magnet and a briefcase, a ghoul magnet
6811000	6812000	Ghoul
6812000	6815000	So we all joined hands and we tried to, like, combine our energy
6815000	6816000	Oh, yeah
6816000	6818000	And then I did come out of the closet with my character
6818000	6824000	Uh, the- the- the- yeah, we were trying to cast an agony spell on whoever
6824000	6827000	So, which- how'd that- how'd that work?
6827000	6833000	I mean, what happened is you all cast the spell on a car that's several miles away
6833000	6837000	So if anything was going to happen, happened, or will happen
6837000	6838000	Okay
6838000	6839000	There's no way of knowing
6839000	6840000	All right
6840000	6843000	Can't I, um, actually project and see if that- see if that worked?
6843000	6846000	Yeah, but you'd have to find the car and you don't know where it is
6846000	6850000	Okay, I- I- I- I- I summon a- a- a- a- a sparrow
6850000	6855000	You're too weak, you just summoned a larger air spirit to do the-
6855000	6857000	I sit down cross-legged
6857000	6858000	All right
6861000	6868000	I would suggest to Dr. Friend that perhaps he applies some sort of healing to our weakened
6869000	6870000	Runmate
6870000	6874000	Dr. Friend, can you- can you try to boost up my mana power level?
6876000	6878000	Um, yeah, man
6878000	6879000	Um
6879000	6881000	I'm- I'm a- I'm a woman
6881000	6882000	What's that?
6882000	6883000	I'm a woman
6883000	6885000	I don't know, I'm blind
6886000	6888000	I always just say, man, about everybody, you know
6888000	6889000	All right, that's good
6889000	6891000	Y'all call my mom like, hey, man
6891000	6893000	Can you make us some stew?
6894000	6898000	Technically, she's a girl and, uh, very sensitive, so
6899000	6901000	So, what do I do?
6902000	6906000	Look- look- look through your spells in there and see what- see if you've got something that can- that can heal me
6906000	6907000	He's got heal
6907000	6909000	Oh, yeah, heal
6909000	6911000	So I just say, yeah, let's do it
6911000	6915000	Okay, so do- do- do your magic, cast that spell, doctor
6917000	6919000	Best used after first aid is applied
6919000	6920000	It's true
6921000	6923000	Yeah, but they always say that, like, uh
6923000	6927000	You're supposed to- you're supposed to clean your ear out before you put drops in
6927000	6928000	That's true
6929000	6931000	Just fix my ear, doc
6932000	6934000	Sorry, I'm just doing some stand-up
6939000	6941000	So I- I need to heal you, what's wrong with you?
6941000	6945000	Uh, I- I just have low energy from casting too many spells of my own and I'm kind of drained
6945000	6947000	Okay, so this should probably rhyme?
6948000	6950000	I think all good spells should rhyme
6952000	6953000	Tell me one more time what the problem is
6953000	6955000	I- I've drained my energy
6955000	6956000	Drained
6956000	6957000	My spiritual energy
6957000	6959000	I'm gonna rhyme it with drain
6960000	6962000	He's got- he's kinda like the pen and-
6962000	6963000	I summon
6963000	6965000	The pen and teller of spell casting
6966000	6968000	He lets you in on the process
6969000	6971000	I summon the spirits
6972000	6975000	To clean the spells you have drained
6976000	6978000	I cast the spirits
6978000	6981000	So wonderful to keep your power back
6981000	6984000	That you'll feel rebrained
6985000	6986000	Nice
6987000	6988000	Heal
6989000	6991000	Those are the spirits, they're the spirits
6991000	6992000	Heal
6992000	6994000	It sounds like booing, those are spirits
6995000	6997000	That thing booing is like
6998000	6999000	Um, I-
6999000	7000000	Did it work, Spencer?
7000000	7002000	Laying hands on Eve Libertine
7003000	7005000	Magical energy surges forth
7005000	7008000	Re-knitting your wounds and refreshing your mind
7012000	7013000	I- I feel great
7014000	7016000	I cast a sparrow to go find the car
7017000	7018000	Alright, how-
7018000	7022000	I summon- I summon a spirit animal with my spirit, uh, charm focus
7022000	7023000	How- how strong?
7023000	7025000	Uh, level five, Jackson
7026000	7029000	You just got- you're like a- you're like a-
7029000	7034000	You're like one of these, uh, drunk people on St. Elsewhere that gets a new liver and then they go to the bar
7035000	7038000	I don't know what to say, one of, that was a story on St. Elsewhere
7039000	7041000	Hey, you know, that's- that's the life of a magician
7041000	7045000	If- if I die in the process of doing what I do, that's- that's just the life I've chosen
7045000	7048000	I'd like to say one thing, if I could, to the group
7048000	7049000	Okay
7049000	7052000	Uh, just because I feel like a lot of what we did tonight
7052000	7056000	Um, or this- this whole- I guess to- to- to- to us it's been tonight
7056000	7059000	But it's been- this has been going on for a while and I feel like
7059000	7063000	We're bad shadow runners and, like, we've had a bad shadow run
7064000	7068000	And I- I've made a lot of bad decisions and like
7068000	7072000	Like, we kinda- we gotta chalk this one up as a failure, right?
7072000	7076000	Like the- they got- they got away, they gave us a ghoul magnet instead of money
7076000	7077000	We didn't get any money
7077000	7079000	It's- it's not over til it's over
7079000	7081000	But- but- but my bird could still, you know, find this guy
7081000	7085000	Half of the characters that we were supposed to either kidnap or protect are dead
7085000	7089000	Like, like, we just- we just- we just kept giving them to the bad guys and they kept killing them
7089000	7094000	Like, like, we're- like, there's no lens through which we could be viewed as even anti-heroes
7094000	7096000	Cause even anti-heroes are part hero
7096000	7098000	Like, we're- we're like anti-neighbors, maybe
7098000	7103000	Are you saying that we just- are you suggesting that we just- just drop this as it lies, if- you know what?
7103000	7107000	This is the great thing about being a shadow runner, do you think Banksy, like, dwells on-
7107000	7109000	Was like, oh, I spray painted that rat wrong
7109000	7111000	I should stop being Banksy
7111000	7113000	He gets up and he tries again
7113000	7115000	You know?
7115000	7120000	Like, we just move on and we hope that this doesn't show up on our LinkedIn
7121000	7125000	So you just wanna start from scratch, new- new Johnson, new- new Shadow Run?
7125000	7128000	Well, we have to, these people aren't gonna pay us for anything else, are they?
7128000	7132000	Should we- should we not look for this car? Cause I have a photographic memory, apparently
7132000	7133000	Oh, yeah?
7133000	7136000	Yeah, I don't know- I don't know what happened before this
7137000	7139000	Well, maybe I'm- maybe I'm doing it wrong again
7139000	7145000	We did a job and the guy was supposed to pay us and instead of- instead of money in the briefcase, he just- it was a transponder that brought a bunch of ghouls to kill us
7145000	7147000	So he just completely hosed us and tried to whack us
7147000	7152000	And, uh, I'm saying, there's no harm in me sending out my bird to see what we see
7152000	7157000	But we can- we can- if you wanna start looking for, like, a clean slate, I'm with that too
7157000	7159000	But there's also the possibility of revenge
7159000	7162000	Oh, yeah, I don't think we've seen the last of that asshole
7162000	7163000	I mean
7163000	7165000	No, he means us taking revenge
7165000	7168000	I mean, we could just go on a killing spree at this point, who cares?
7168000	7170000	Well, because that doesn't pay anything
7170000	7178000	That's my point, is that we're supposed to be, at worst, mercenaries, and at best, maybe a dark version of a hero in an unlikely context
7178000	7185000	What we- what we have done on this Shadowrun is, like, it's- it's like we're some strange, um, uh, drunk animal that just-
7185000	7192000	And we have- we've hurt people and ourselves and we've made less money than we could have made and we've- we've- we've cost everyone their lives
7192000	7197000	And we're standing here, in the street, exhausted, almost dead, with a ghoul magnet
7197000	7198000	We just-
7198000	7199000	You gotta let the ghoul magnet thing go, man
7199000	7202000	Well, this is- no, it burned, it fucking hurts, man
7202000	7205000	Cause the whole time I was thinking, just get that suitcase full of money and it's a fucking ghoul magnet
7205000	7210000	Like, I feel- it's my fault, I feel like a piece of shit, I feel like a bad Shadowrunner
7210000	7214000	But you have to be able to do, like, as he- as she said, let- let these things go
7214000	7218000	If you want to cut bait, then, uh, emotionally you must cut bait as well
7218000	7223000	This is, of course, a world of shadows and- and running and- and chaos
7223000	7224000	And half
7224000	7227000	And the boundaries are imaginary or also constructed
7227000	7232000	And you, again, you must, you know, do two things at once and do nothing at the same time
7232000	7233000	Okay, how about this?
7233000	7237000	Just sort of attacking and then not carrying too much water with you, you know
7237000	7239000	Let's go forward, if you're going to go forward
7239000	7244000	Otherwise, we turn tail, we find this guy using, uh, what tools we have necessary
7244000	7246000	Find him and blast his fucking head off
7247000	7254000	And the currency, the currency, the currency, I might suggest, uh, is the satisfaction of revenge
7254000	7257000	Blood is, uh, tasty when- when drunk
7257000	7260000	And quenches thirst for years and years
7260000	7263000	And then you go forward, and then you make money
7264000	7265000	If possible
7265000	7269000	Okay, but, Cordegard, can I trust you to remind me why we're getting revenge?
7269000	7273000	Uh, like, because it seems like almost, we- we're the only ones that did anything wrong
7273000	7279000	Okay, but what I'm saying is if you're okay, well, first of all, uh, a deal is a deal unless a deal has not happened
7279000	7281000	Right, we want our money, we want our money
7281000	7282000	We want our fucking money
7282000	7283000	We want our fucking money
7283000	7284000	Here's what I say
7284000	7286000	You know, I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm pissed about this
7286000	7287000	I'm going to send my little bird out
7287000	7290000	When we find him, I'm going to actually project, track that dude down
7290000	7296000	I want to summon the biggest orca in the world and just smash the whole fucking car
7296000	7301000	It's just like th- th- th- th- th- th- th- th- th- th- th- th- th- th- th- th- th- th- th- th- th- th- th- th- th- th- th- th- th- the speech
7301000	7307000	Th- no, the mainstay speech of the old- the old, old, old, high women, uh, or also at a man's
7307000	7310000	Which is your money or your life, you know?
7310000	7311000	That's it
7311000	7312000	It's very simple
7312000	7313000	We- Hord- Hordegard's got a point, I'm with Hordegard
7313000	7315000	If you have a photographic memory, for Christ's sake
7315000	7316000	Yeah, no, no, no
7316000	7318000	Use it in three dimensions, spin the car around, find the license to leave
7318000	7320000	Is that something we can roll on? My photographic memory?
7320000	7321000	I mean, you have it
7321000	7325000	I'd like to talk to the other gay Shadow Runner, Dr. Friend
7325000	7326000	Okay
7326000	7328000	Thank you
7328000	7336000	I just want to tell everyone that if your parents have had a transvaginal mesh situation
7336000	7339000	That there are attorneys now that you can contact
7339000	7347000	And several attorneys now that specialize in transvaginal mesh detachments
7347000	7349000	What is that? What is that?
7349000	7351000	What are you saying? What is that?
7351000	7356000	It's- I guess it's something so that your organs don't fall out of your vagina
7356000	7360000	And apparently what they're making this mesh out of is what they're-
7360000	7361000	Is that something I should be concerned about?
7361000	7364000	Not yet, but at some point
7364000	7367000	Cliffhanger!
7367000	7374000	The cliffhanger is Callie's 40th birthday? I don't know what-
7377000	7382000	Let's thank Callie Kazoo for coming up here, go check out her new record
7382000	7389000	Demarj Brown, Spencer Crittenden, Horatio Sands
7389000	7391000	Thank you
7391000	7393000	What a treat, Horatio, thank you so much
7393000	7395000	Go check out his show, The Horatio
7395000	7397000	Maybe one day he'll be on Farrah's
7399000	7402000	I'm Jeff Davis, one more time for your mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon
7413000	7415000	Did you get any of that?
7415000	7418000	It's a good show!
