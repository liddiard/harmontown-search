0	22160	Hello one and all, welcome once again to those of you, the lucky few digging in live
22160	26780	here at Meltdown Comics in Hollywood and those listening around the world, the beautiful
26780	31780	planet Earth, Harman Town is now in session.
31780	44780	Please welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
44780	51780	Thank you, thank you.
52780	60780	This is buttoning my sweatshirt in front of my gut, it's pretty, it's fooling everybody,
60780	61780	right?
61780	62780	It's slimming.
62780	66780	If you cover something, you don't know it's there.
66780	69780	Are you saying you've put on a couple?
69780	71780	Yeah, definitely, definitely.
71780	75780	A lot of stress at work and a lot of seeking comfort.
75780	80780	You're on a diet and it's just like, that's its own thing, it's discipline and then any
80780	84780	excuse at work, you just go, well, if I'm staying here all night, then I'm going to
84780	88780	eat chicken and waffles because I deserve that and all that stuff.
88780	93780	I talked to Dino and he said that, Dino Stamatopoulos friend and writer on your show, he said that
93780	96780	you guys are ordering lots of gourmet food like every day.
96780	103780	We try, you know, Sony doesn't pay for coffee, they still pay for meals, so we really try
103780	105780	to shiv them.
106780	108780	What's the average?
108780	111780	Puffer fish again or whatever.
111780	113780	You having fugu?
113780	115780	Yeah.
115780	119780	Anyways, and every Friday is Wings Friday, I get hot wings for everybody.
119780	124780	That's actually out of pocket, I don't know why.
124780	130780	What a great opening to the show, just talking about being fat and eating.
130780	133780	There's some corrections in order.
133780	138780	Somebody tweeted me to let us know that the internet was developed for scientific purposes,
138780	140780	not military.
140780	144780	So I guess that's the one thing we got wrong last week.
144780	147780	The only thing we've ever gotten wrong.
147780	153780	For all of you history buffs using our show as some kind of archive or you aliens digging
153780	158780	this up and putting it into your factoids about earth, yeah, we don't know what we're
158780	159780	doing here.
159780	163780	We just drop into a pool and we reach for a laugh.
163780	167780	What's the difference between scientific pursuits and military?
167780	171780	Don't military people constantly think that they're being scientific?
171780	175780	I feel like any time anything beautiful is developed or invented, the military finds
175780	178780	an awesome way to turn out in the way to kill people.
178780	180780	And yet not the internet.
180780	182780	They couldn't figure it out.
182780	184780	Isn't that great?
184780	186780	They can kill you with the internet.
186780	189780	Well, now they can use it to enslave you.
189780	190780	Yeah.
190780	194780	But it's kind of beautiful that they didn't see it coming and figure out a way to roll
194780	199780	it out in a way that we enslaved ourselves with the internet.
199780	204780	Nobody pulled a sheet off of it and said, here's how it works and this is the only way
204780	205780	you can use it.
205780	208780	You have to have a six on your forehead in order to log into this level and you have
208780	209780	the orange clearance here.
209780	211780	It just kind of evolved organically.
211780	216780	And we found out something from the internet, which is that we all want to be idiots.
216780	221780	We don't want to topple the power structures.
221780	223780	We like Twinkies.
223780	225780	We like YouTube.
225780	229780	Yeah, it's willful surrender to control.
229780	234780	The book We by Sami Anton, people have read that before?
234780	235780	Yeah.
236780	238780	It's proto-sci-fi.
238780	243780	It's the only book written in the future and people very willfully submit to control.
243780	248780	When you have a society that's high on the hog, it's that whole bread and circuses thing,
248780	249780	right?
249780	252780	That's where the Coliseum comes from.
252780	256780	Just give us entertainment in exchange for all this power and wealth that we all have.
256780	262780	Like America, we're very self-loathing lately about our economy, but we still are not eating
262780	263780	our own feet.
264780	267780	There's still more food in the garbage than there is available.
267780	271780	And we need a lot of entertainment and stuff, a lot of distraction.
271780	275780	This show's kicked off on a very cheery note.
275780	277780	I think it bodes well.
277780	282780	Well, further from the corrections department, when we brought up Glenn, who brought the
282780	286780	Earthshine, he wrote us a very nice letter, gave us some more Earthshine.
286780	287780	I'm going to stay off of it.
287780	291780	And by Earthshine, for those of you who don't know, it's high-quality moonshine.
291780	295780	I'm certain that we're all going to jail for some kind of federal crime.
295780	300780	He typically uses it for his absinthe, but it's like an ingredient of his absinthe.
300780	303780	But her absinthe, that's what the correction is.
303780	304780	Wait, wait, wait.
304780	305780	What?
305780	306780	Yeah.
306780	308780	We have a lot of transgender Harmontown fans.
308780	309780	How many?
309780	311780	Three is a lot.
312780	315780	It's a very peculiar state to be transgender.
315780	316780	Three is a crowd.
316780	317780	Is Glenn here?
317780	321780	No, Glenn is not here, Glenn slash Jane, who he wanted to...
321780	325780	He said, she said, that when she came up...
325780	328780	I know what it's like to be dead.
333780	335780	I asked, what's your name?
335780	342780	And she blurted out, Glenn, force of habit, wanted to send a letter of, among other things,
342780	345780	saying, like, by the way, so that people don't get confused on the internet, where he is very
345780	354780	much out of the transgen closet and things, as Jane, spelled G-A-N-N-E, rhymes with plain.
354780	357780	That's the thing that kills me, Jane.
357780	362780	You're transgender, but not enough complexity for you.
362780	370780	Your name is Jane, spelled G-A-N-N-E, just in case, like, anybody got through the transgender gauntlet
370780	373780	without being alarmed or confused.
373780	375780	Did she or he...
375780	377780	How do I address he or her, he or she?
377780	383780	I think the whole idea is that they identify as a female, and so the pronoun you use is she.
383780	386780	Because Glenn could be a female name as well.
386780	393780	I suppose anything could be, but she has assumed a new angle of identity.
393780	394780	I don't know.
394780	395780	You can't even...
395780	397780	It's a new emergent thing.
397780	398780	It's exciting.
398780	399780	I'm actually very fired.
399780	402780	Why do our transgender fans come here in male attire?
402780	406780	Because they're not transvestites.
406780	408780	They are not necessarily...
408780	410780	I don't know anything about this.
410780	411780	I don't either.
411780	415780	What's funny is that half of the people, you brought Levi up, and he started talking about his thing,
415780	418780	and you could hear people in our LA audience going,
418780	426780	like, he's being close-minded about describing himself as transgender because he said he wanted to...
426780	430780	He is okay having a mustache because he doesn't have a uterus, and you could hear people go,
431780	434780	glass ceiling, or whatever.
434780	440780	He said something that wasn't the exact way that other people understand transgender to be.
440780	442780	Transgenderism, I don't even know what to call it.
442780	444780	But I am very flattered that...
444780	448780	Because I don't think you could get more fringe psychologically.
448780	450780	Is that politically incorrect to say?
450780	458780	I don't think you could be more complex on the inside of a human head compared to what's going on outside your body, in other words.
459780	468780	As far as somebody that you would look at in line at the bank and not be immediately presented with something that registered with you,
468780	474780	you couldn't have more noodles going on up there, more twists and turns,
474780	479780	more reasons to be distrustful of the people around you,
479780	487780	more suspicion, more fear that somebody might bully you for answering questions about yourself or expressing yourself.
487780	488780	And so I'm very, very flattered.
488780	494780	I take that as a barometer of our good work here and my good philosophy in religion,
494780	500780	and that any person in that situation would come...
500780	507780	Would listen to our podcast and feel comforted and feel comfortable, like, you know, expressing that.
507780	509780	I think that's...
509780	512780	Is anybody else here a transgender that we don't know about?
512780	515780	Have we met all of them, or are there more lurking about?
516780	518780	All right, well...
518780	520780	I mean, I think they all are. They're just more afraid to say it.
520780	521780	Yeah.
521780	524780	There's a couple of trans-scientologists, people who...
524780	527780	They identify as Scientologists, but they don't actually...
527780	529780	They're not Scientologists.
529780	534780	They want to be called Scientologists because they feel like a Scientologist,
534780	538780	but they're not going to pay for that crap.
538780	543780	So, I'm not being, like, flippant.
544780	546780	You can identify as a woman.
546780	548780	Look like a man. Not want to dress like a woman.
548780	549780	Right.
549780	550780	Just inside you're a woman.
550780	551780	Right.
551780	553780	But dress like a guy.
553780	554780	Right.
554780	556780	And that's...
556780	558780	Right.
558780	559780	Yeah.
559780	563780	Is that someone not following through with it, or is that somebody saying,
563780	566780	No, I just am a woman and I'll still dress like a guy named Tony?
566780	568780	I think it's just breaking it up into different strata.
568780	571780	Like, you can stop there if you want.
571780	572780	That's a thing.
572780	574780	And then there's people of that...
574780	579780	That are in that situation that therefore want to...
579780	580780	I don't know, there's a different language for it.
580780	582780	They take steps medically, hormones and stuff.
582780	583780	Transition.
583780	585780	Yeah, they transition.
585780	586780	Our friend...
586780	589780	I heard it said a long time ago that nobody...
589780	592780	I mean, very few people would be completely heterosexual
592780	597780	if it was a sliding scale from zero to 100 or from left to right
597780	602780	that people's sexuality tends to be somewhere along a sliding scale
602780	605780	that nobody is completely masculine or completely feminine.
605780	609780	Where do you feel you fall on the scale, Dan?
609780	616780	How close to totally masculine or toward the middle into the nether region?
616780	623780	You know, I think Mark Ruffalo is a real charming piece of...
624780	626780	I wouldn't mind if he pulled up on his motorbike
626780	628780	and showed me at a garden.
632780	635780	I could surrender to...
635780	638780	Sexually speaking, sexually...
638780	643780	I've never even had the time or energy to examine
643780	647780	where in the spectrum between hetero and homo I would fall
647780	651780	because there's too much going on in the hetero side
651780	654780	with me and my various kinks and things.
654780	661780	I'm sort of caught between hetero and asexual.
661780	664780	I feel like some weird shit happened to me
664780	667780	when I was a kid involving maybe hanging out under the table
667780	671780	while 70s pantyhose clad women hung out.
671780	675780	There's some kind of leg fetish thing that I almost feel is like...
675780	678780	I really like fully clothed women.
678780	681780	It's very, very strange.
681780	684780	There are things that I consume as pornography
684780	687780	that you would not consider pornography.
687780	691780	Let's just say for Thanksgiving I invited Mark Ruffalo over
691780	696780	and he was wearing nice trousers.
696780	698780	Oh, nice trousers.
698780	701780	And let's say that you dropped your napkin under the table
701780	704780	and you saw that Mark Ruffalo was wearing kind of a high heel
704780	706780	and he was...
706780	710780	No, I like the feminine leg.
710780	713780	Have you seen Mark Ruffalo's leg?
713780	717780	Well, if he could pass, there's guys on YouTube that do that.
717780	719780	You're clicking around and you're like,
719780	722780	here's what peels my banana.
722780	724780	Legs and tights.
724780	727780	They do a little shoe play across the leg.
727780	729780	You find something and it's like,
729780	731780	oh, wow, that's pretty good.
731780	734780	It's like, dude, guy, guy, dude.
734780	736780	And you're like, what?
736780	738780	God damn it.
738780	742780	You got me, Michael.
742780	744780	Yeah.
744780	746780	You know, you have to look closely for that Adam's apple
746780	751780	right on the back of the calf.
751780	752780	I didn't know that.
752780	754780	What is shoe play?
754780	759780	Shoe play is dangling, dipping, heel popping.
760780	762780	Those are the three subtypes of shoe play.
762780	764780	I'm glad you asked.
764780	767780	Dan, would you please elucidate
767780	770780	what is the difference between dangling and dipping?
770780	771780	Dangling and dipping.
771780	776780	Dangling is leg crossed shoe hanging off the toe, you know.
776780	779780	Sexy secretary, librarian or something like, you know.
779780	782780	And is the whole woman in frame or just a leg?
782780	786780	Just a leg is fine with this old timer.
787780	791780	We have a colloquy here.
791780	794780	How many other people are into dangling and dippins?
794780	796780	I dated a shoe fetishist.
796780	797780	You dated a shoe fetishist?
797780	798780	Yeah.
798780	799780	Wow.
799780	801780	And so did you dangle and dip and pop in the whole
801780	803780	sweep swab and the flip flap?
803780	807780	I don't know about the vernacular with it.
807780	809780	Dangling, dipping, heel popping.
809780	810780	Okay, so what's dipping?
810780	811780	What is dipping?
811780	815780	Dipping is like shoe on the floor as far as I understand it.
815780	817780	Do you have my heels on right now?
817780	818780	Yeah.
818780	819780	Can you dangle and dip for us up there?
819780	821780	Let's walk over to the stage.
821780	824780	Well, it's an audio podcast.
824780	826780	Yeah, but...
826780	829780	I don't think she's going to be able to dip with those shoes.
829780	830780	Yeah, yeah.
830780	833780	If you're like dipping into the shoe.
833780	837780	Just imagine like a looser, like a high heel shoe
837780	840780	or like a flat or something that had like easy,
840780	842780	like you can get your foot in and out of it.
842780	845780	So dipping is like the woman is like in and out,
845780	846780	you know, like kind of...
846780	847780	Do you want the shoe?
847780	848780	I don't.
848780	849780	I don't.
849780	853780	It's an audio podcast and also I'm getting weirdly like a...
853780	856780	It's making me nervous.
856780	857780	Lauren, right?
857780	858780	Yeah.
858780	860780	Lauren from the front row came up and offered to dip
860780	862780	and dangle and dingle and scrape scrub.
862780	864780	The second round I just offered up a shoe.
864780	866780	I just produced a high heel.
866780	869780	Yeah, we're getting to the city limits of where Aaron's
869780	870780	not going to be very happy listening to you.
870780	871780	Get the shoe up here.
871780	872780	Fuck it.
872780	874780	Let's do this.
874780	878780	I want to know about dangles and dips and scoops
878780	879780	and squeeze and the whole thing.
879780	881780	What's your name, madam?
881780	882780	Annie.
882780	884780	Well, this is a weird choice for a podcast to make.
884780	885780	I'm just...
885780	886780	I'm worried as a producer.
886780	887780	Like what are we...
887780	888780	What are people listening to?
888780	890780	We're bringing women up on stage and we're...
890780	891780	And also just so Aaron knows,
891780	893780	I'm not like Howard Sturning or anything.
893780	896780	I'm not even going to look or anything.
896780	898780	Like Aaron, if you're listening, like I'm not...
898780	899780	This is not like...
900780	904780	Aaron, if you're listening, Dan has his pants down already.
908780	909780	That's very important to me.
909780	912780	I wouldn't tolerate the equivalent with Aaron, you know?
912780	914780	I was a little upset when she was fucking around
914780	915780	with that cat shirt guy.
915780	916780	Wait a minute.
916780	917780	The cat shirt guy.
917780	918780	Okay, fuck it.
918780	919780	He was hot.
919780	920780	No, no, no.
922780	923780	Anyways, okay.
923780	924780	What's your name, ma'am?
924780	925780	Annie.
925780	927780	Annie's dangling right now.
928780	930780	She was dangling from her toe.
930780	931780	That's a dangle.
931780	932780	This is very difficult to do, actually.
932780	933780	All right, yeah.
933780	934780	Okay, now give us some dipping, Annie.
934780	935780	Okay, so what's dipping?
935780	936780	Dipping is...
936780	938780	You have to stand up and then you're...
938780	941780	Pretend you're checking somebody into a hotel
941780	942780	and you're working on the computer
942780	945780	and you're kind of absentmindedly like...
947780	948780	That's dipping.
950780	951780	All right.
951780	953780	Although now I'm wondering what heel popping actually is
953780	954780	because that involves...
954780	956780	I thought this was heel popping
956780	958780	where it's like where you've got the...
958780	960780	No, that's Nancy Drew...
960780	962780	If your heel pops out of it,
962780	963780	I can't do it in these shoes.
963780	965780	Then how is that different going?
965780	966780	I'm so confused.
966780	968780	That's where your heel sort of pops out.
968780	969780	Okay.
970780	972780	Somehow I'm still not turned on.
972780	973780	I don't understand.
976780	978780	Not because you're not beautiful in sexy women.
978780	980780	No, I don't know why this isn't doing anything for you.
980780	982780	Yeah, I've never got the feet thing.
982780	983780	I mean, I like feet.
983780	985780	I'm not averse to feet.
985780	987780	I've never seen the allure of...
987780	988780	Oh, I know what heel popping is.
988780	989780	I just realized.
991780	993780	Heel popping is the precursor to a dangle
993780	996780	because you can't dangle unless you pop the heel.
996780	999780	So heel popping enthusiasts just want to see that
999780	1001780	popping of the heel over and over again.
1001780	1002780	I just want to see this moment.
1002780	1003780	Yeah, that moment.
1003780	1004780	Yeah, yeah.
1004780	1005780	And then back on and off.
1005780	1007780	But as far as I've been told, once you pop,
1007780	1008780	you can't stop.
1009780	1010780	All right, come on.
1010780	1011780	Let's thank these ladies.
1011780	1012780	All right, sit the fuck down.
1012780	1013780	Thank you very much.
1016780	1018780	Our poor listeners, they're like,
1018780	1020780	do you want to welcome us into this world?
1020780	1021780	What are you doing?
1021780	1024780	You got people up on stage showing us shoe things?
1024780	1025780	Our job is not to care about the listeners.
1025780	1028780	It's our job to reward the live audience then.
1028780	1030780	All right, start the laser show.
1031780	1034780	Whoa, too soon.
1034780	1038780	Oh, interesting take on the Jimmy Kimmel situation visually.
1038780	1039780	I'm not sure.
1039780	1040780	I'm not sure.
1040780	1041780	I'm not sure.
1041780	1042780	I'm not sure.
1042780	1043780	I'm not sure.
1043780	1047780	I was just talking to the Jimmy Kimmel situation visually.
1047780	1051780	Huh, I never thought about that, laid out in that diagram.
1051780	1053780	Oh, that brings it all together.
1053780	1055780	Good night, folks.
1056780	1060780	Dan, for the listener, describe the Jimmy Kimmel situation.
1061780	1064780	Well, you're asking as a joke because you think I improvised
1064780	1066780	the words Jimmy Kimmel situation, but there is one.
1066780	1067780	There was one.
1067780	1068780	I don't know.
1068780	1069780	I said, I don't.
1069780	1072780	I feel like I'm part of the problem saying there was one.
1072780	1074780	You know, the tabloid streak.
1074780	1077780	Jimmy Kimmel did a segment that was sort of like Kids Say the Darnedest Things.
1077780	1082780	He was having kids talk about how to handle the various world crises,
1082780	1086780	one of them being America's trillion-dollar debt to Japan,
1086780	1088780	or to China.
1088780	1092780	And one of the kids kind of half through a chuckle
1092780	1095780	and like a little kid flustery thing said, like,
1095780	1097780	I don't know, maybe we should kill all the people in China.
1097780	1100780	And Jimmy was like, yeah, that's an interesting answer.
1100780	1101780	I don't know.
1101780	1102780	Moving on.
1102780	1107780	Flash cut two headlines saying, like, you know,
1107780	1111780	White House apologizes to China for the, you know,
1111780	1114780	genocide jokes on the thing.
1114780	1116780	Asian Americans in comment section saying,
1116780	1117780	oh, that's a funny joke.
1117780	1118780	How about this one?
1118780	1120780	Let's kill all the Jews.
1120780	1123780	No comment on any of this.
1123780	1125780	I'm out.
1126780	1130780	All I can say is I don't care what you find funny.
1130780	1132780	I don't care what any of us think are funny.
1132780	1134780	I don't care about the empirical definitions of humor.
1134780	1136780	But I just got one question.
1136780	1138780	Are we going to be fucking cone heads?
1138780	1140780	What are we going to do?
1140780	1143780	What is this world going to look like in 2070?
1143780	1145780	Do we really think we're going to achieve some world
1145780	1148780	where everyone just kind of quietly glides around
1148780	1152780	and someone like emits a proton and it's the equivalent of a fart
1152780	1155780	and everyone like titters and you...
1155780	1158780	Do you really think that once a noose starts tightening
1158780	1162780	it ever gets loose, linguistically, verbally, socially?
1162780	1163780	Do you really...
1163780	1165780	Have you ever experienced anything that indicated to you
1165780	1169780	that once people started introducing the concept of limitation
1169780	1171780	anything ever got more liberated?
1171780	1173780	I know we all think that we are advanced
1173780	1176780	because they didn't have the Seinfeld masturbation episode
1176780	1177780	in Victorian England.
1177780	1181780	But there's another way of looking at this
1181780	1184780	is that we are becoming insects.
1184780	1186780	We are envying everything that ants have
1186780	1189780	and not embracing anything that primates have.
1189780	1191780	And we are just looking so forward
1191780	1193780	to the day when we have a hive mind
1193780	1196780	and we just barf trophallaxis into each other's mouths
1196780	1198780	and that you can tell from the chemical where you've been
1198780	1199780	and where you're going.
1199780	1201780	And we just love it. We can't wait.
1201780	1204780	We're just sanding down the little bumps and edges.
1204780	1206780	We're just taking so much glee in it, too.
1206780	1207780	That's the weird thing.
1207780	1210780	There's a primatological glee taking a gazelle femur
1210780	1213780	and smashing a racist joke's head.
1213780	1215780	That's a racist joke. I'm a racist.
1215780	1220780	And it's like you're emitting a pheromone.
1220780	1223780	You're getting flushed and excited.
1223780	1226780	And it's like by bashing the world around you,
1226780	1230780	trying to round up all the little anomalies
1230780	1233780	and get all the air bubbles out of the waterbed mattress.
1233780	1236780	This finish line that you think you're headed towards,
1236780	1239780	I feel like I can see it at 40.
1239780	1242780	I feel like I know it's not going to be that fun.
1242780	1246780	Yeah, we're very willfully and kind of gleefully sacrificing
1246780	1248780	liberty for security.
1248780	1250780	We're not getting any smarter. That's the thing.
1250780	1253780	None of these people that are learning how to be offended
1253780	1255780	know where Guatemala is on a map.
1255780	1259780	But the thing is, someone's going to go online after the show
1259780	1262780	when they hear this and go on a forum and say,
1262780	1264780	we are getting smarter, man.
1264780	1267780	Life is evolution. Jack and everything is getting better.
1267780	1270780	I was saying that the English language,
1270780	1273780	and I would say all languages are probably degrading
1273780	1275780	because we're all truncating language.
1275780	1278780	And people say, no, it's not. Language is always evolving.
1278780	1280780	I fucking disagree with that.
1280780	1282780	The English language is a huge language,
1282780	1285780	and we don't use any of the words.
1285780	1288780	Instead of having five words that mean one thing,
1288780	1291780	we now use one word to mean 11 things.
1291780	1293780	That's not the growth of the language.
1293780	1295780	That is the shrinking of the language.
1295780	1297780	And if anyone wants to go online with me
1297780	1299780	and have a conversation about that, I'd love to.
1299780	1304780	I don't think that we're evolving at all with technology.
1304780	1306780	It's not just me being grumpy old man.
1306780	1310780	I really do think that the language dies every time.
1310780	1314780	People say, oh, what's the fucking word that people use?
1314780	1315780	Awesome sauce?
1315780	1316780	Awesome sauce.
1316780	1317780	Amaze balls.
1317780	1318780	Amaze balls.
1318780	1320780	No, I will stand by amaze balls because that's amaze balls.
1320780	1321780	Amaze balls.
1321780	1323780	Is it a new way to say it?
1323780	1326780	There's something like 180 synonyms for the word nice,
1326780	1329780	and we use nice for 180 of them
1329780	1332780	because we don't know all the fucking words anymore.
1332780	1334780	Oh, what's that?
1334780	1336780	He was a...
1336780	1338780	What's that? Not taciturn. What's the fucking word?
1338780	1339780	Reticent.
1339780	1340780	Reticent.
1340780	1342780	I was reticent to do that.
1342780	1343780	No, you were reluctant to do that.
1343780	1345780	Reticent doesn't mean reluctant.
1345780	1346780	Now it does.
1346780	1347780	We've made reticent mean reluctant
1347780	1349780	because we've misused it for so long
1349780	1351780	that the dictionaries have just said, fuck it.
1351780	1353780	Now it means reluctant.
1353780	1355780	And that's not the growth of a language.
1355780	1357780	That's a language dying a little bit
1357780	1360780	because reticent is a better word than...
1360780	1363780	We don't need two words to say reluctant.
1363780	1364780	I love this great show.
1364780	1366780	We went from Uncle Creepy's foot fetish corner
1366780	1371780	to Grandpa Grumpy's vocabulary police.
1371780	1373780	Fucking...
1373780	1376780	Also, the dictionary in your iPhone sucks.
1376780	1377780	Don't use that dictionary.
1377780	1381780	Have a fucking real Merriam-Webster giant OED.
1381780	1383780	Have a big motherfucking dictionary with you
1383780	1387780	at all times and use it.
1387780	1390780	The iPhone dictionary is as good as fucking Google Weather.
1390780	1393780	Google Weather says it's 73 and it's fucking 45 now.
1393780	1394780	They don't know.
1394780	1396780	Don't trust your iPhone for fuck...
1396780	1398780	Although today I was experimenting with Siri
1398780	1400780	and she's quite funny if you say dirty things to me.
1400780	1401780	Oh, yeah.
1401780	1404780	You can have a good time in bed just hanging out.
1405780	1406780	Aaron and I...
1406780	1407780	Aaron and I...
1407780	1411780	We talk to Siri and get Siri to talk to the other Siri.
1411780	1413780	You know, like, I'll say to Siri,
1413780	1414780	like, why don't you go fuck yourself?
1414780	1416780	And then she'll turn on her Siri
1416780	1419780	and then Siri's response, which will be like something like,
1419780	1420780	oh, I think you should watch your language.
1420780	1422780	And then Siri will say to Siri,
1422780	1425780	I'm sorry, would you like me to look that up on the internet?
1425780	1429780	How do you like it, bitch?
1429780	1432780	I'd blush if I could.
1432780	1433780	I turned mine on in Italian.
1433780	1434780	Have you tried the Italian lady?
1434780	1435780	No.
1435780	1436780	Talk to her.
1438780	1440780	There's my fetish.
1440780	1443780	Siri, do they...
1443780	1444780	Il Ristorante?
1448780	1449780	It's fucking good.
1450780	1451780	It's very sexy.
1451780	1454780	This episode of Harmontown is brought to you by Fulton and Roark.
1454780	1458780	Jeff, you're sick of spilling all your colognes all over the place.
1458780	1459780	You hate liquid colognes.
1459780	1460780	Is that correct?
1460780	1461780	It's my nemesis.
1461780	1464780	It's the thing that gives me nightmare dreams all night long.
1464780	1466780	I can't remember how many times I've walked in on you
1466780	1469780	just covered in sticky wet cologne.
1469780	1473780	I have traveled and broken a bottle of the cologne that I wear,
1473780	1478780	and then my luggage smells like a French whorehouse for the rest of time.
1478780	1479780	Yeah.
1479780	1481780	But Fulton and Roark is a men's fragrance and grooming company
1481780	1484780	that specializes in solid colognes, shave and shower products,
1484780	1487780	all designed to make getting ready easier and more enjoyable.
1487780	1490780	Now, when you say solid colognes, do you mean like solid in the jazz sense?
1490780	1493780	Like, wow, that jazz solo was solid.
1493780	1497780	You know, I do mean that, but I also mean physically solid as well.
1497780	1499780	Oh, like a little, like you're talking about a wax-based cologne
1499780	1503780	that travels in a little small package that I can't spill all over my luggage
1503780	1507780	and smell like a Mexican tit house.
1507780	1510780	So these are travel-friendly wax-based colognes that can go anywhere?
1510780	1514780	Plus, there's nothing to break or spill, and of course, they all smell fantastic.
1514780	1515780	Fantastic.
1515780	1517780	Like a Mexican tit house.
1518780	1522780	I mean, there's different levels of Mexican tit house.
1522780	1524780	I mean, there's the high-quality ones.
1524780	1526780	There's the ones that you wish you didn't go to.
1526780	1527780	Right, yeah.
1527780	1529780	Titas Fantástico.
1529780	1532780	Is one of their fragrances called Mexican tit house?
1532780	1533780	Yeah.
1533780	1535780	Que Fantástico.
1536780	1539780	Fulton and Roark's bar soap is designed to exfoliate the skin
1539780	1541780	with or without a washcloth.
1541780	1542780	Also, you don't even have to touch it.
1542780	1544780	It comes in desert in the night.
1544780	1546780	Well, that's amazing.
1546780	1549780	That's literally unbelievable.
1549780	1552780	Did you know, Spencer, that GQ magazine just named their shave cream
1552780	1554780	the very best on the market today?
1554780	1556780	Well, yeah, of course I knew that.
1556780	1557780	Why would you ask?
1557780	1558780	I mean, who am I asking?
1558780	1559780	I mean, this guy.
1559780	1561780	You go to this house, it's like an episode of Hoarders.
1561780	1564780	So many back issues of GQ magazine there.
1564780	1567780	Right, and I got to tell you, my house is made out of bricks of cologne.
1567780	1569780	Wax-based cologne, I hope.

1615780	1626780	Quip is the new electric toothbrush that packs just the right amount of vibrations into a slimmer design at a fraction of the cost of bulkier, traditional electric brushes.
1626780	1634780	One nice thing about quip toothbrushes is that they vibrate you with cues to switch tooth sides.
1634780	1636780	Like which side you're brushing?
1636780	1637780	Yes.
1637780	1640780	It also comes with a mount that suctions to your mirror.
1640780	1650780	Yeah, and I've been using my quip for a little bit so I can testify to the fact that even though it doesn't sound like a suction sticky holder on your mirror would actually stay on your mirror, it does.
1650780	1655780	Millennials have descended on your least likable activity.
1655780	1657780	The kids are calling it quip.
1658780	1661780	Millennials are calling it brush toothing.
1661780	1662780	And Time Magazine.
1662780	1664780	I'm sure the Xers think it's anything but.
1664780	1670780	And Time Magazine is calling it one of the best inventions of the year. Just think about that.
1670780	1676780	Quip is backed by a network of over 10,000 dental professionals including dentists, hygienists, and dental students.
1676780	1680780	Here's a thing that you're getting with quip that I noticed when I got my kit.
1681780	1683780	You got a little easy to read booklet there.
1683780	1687780	It's kind of indoctrinating you into a toothbrushing regimen.
1687780	1707780	So it's like if you're into self-care this year, and you should be because the world's dying, it's kind of cool to be in the hands of a bunch of people that have studied toothbrushing to the point where, okay, they're going to send you a new toothbrush head the minute yours is going to be worn out.
1707780	1710780	A new battery the minute this thing stops vibrating.
1710780	1716780	It's a subscription to dental security.
1716780	1718780	Quip starts at just $25.
1718780	1727780	And if you go to getquip.com slash harmontown right now, you'll get your first refill pack for free with a quip electric toothbrush.

1739780	1740780	All right.
1740780	1741780	We have a guest here.
1741780	1744780	Did you know that Feral Audio is a whole network, Jeff?
1744780	1746780	You got to be shitting me.
1746780	1748780	I thought we were the only thing on Feral Audio.
1748780	1749780	No, no.
1749780	1753780	We're part of a fucking union of brothers and sisters.
1753780	1754780	Well, that sounds like bullshit.
1754780	1761780	Represent the cutting edge of unpaid comedy types.
1762780	1766780	And here's another member of our family, Mr. Brody Stevens.
1766780	1767780	Yeah.
1785780	1790780	You know, thank you for having me here, Dan and Jeffrey.
1790780	1791780	I am wearing a hat.
1791780	1798780	I just flew in from Toronto, and I was able to wear kind of a knit cap thing.
1798780	1799780	It was cold there.
1799780	1800780	Yeah.
1800780	1805780	So I was bringing the energy of Toronto with me here to meltdown.
1805780	1806780	What's the Toronto scene like?
1806780	1809780	Is it like a Seattle in the north?
1809780	1811780	You know, you would think so.
1811780	1812780	From the hat.
1812780	1813780	I mean, well, there you go.
1813780	1814780	Well, it was cold.
1814780	1817780	I mean, I would say it's like more.
1817780	1819780	I mean, it's like Buffalo, obviously.
1819780	1820780	It's near.
1820780	1821780	It's near.
1821780	1822780	They share the Niagara Falls.
1822780	1823780	I learned about that.
1823780	1827780	I've been to Vancouver, but I've been to Toronto a couple times.
1827780	1829780	It's like America, you know?
1829780	1834780	I was doing shows last night, and I think they are.
1834780	1838780	It's just a little different up there.
1838780	1845780	You know, it's like it is America, but it's not right there.
1845780	1848780	I like Canadian comedy audiences.
1848780	1850780	I think Canadians have an awesome sense of humor.
1850780	1852780	I think they're quite game, especially.
1852780	1853780	Yeah.
1853780	1854780	I'm not ripping Canada.
1854780	1857780	No, you know, Brody, you were fucking shitting all over Canada.
1857780	1858780	Let's be honest about it.
1858780	1859780	No, I'll give you it.
1859780	1864780	Like last night, I was doing a show in a club, an underground pot club.
1864780	1865780	What?
1865780	1866780	It's a comedy club.
1866780	1869780	There's like six clubs up there where they smoke pot.
1869780	1871780	They do shows.
1871780	1874780	Underground meaning not legitimate, like secret, speakeasy.
1874780	1877780	Kind of, yeah, but the cops like let it go.
1877780	1880780	But they have a big comedy scene up there for that in Toronto.
1880780	1883780	So I was doing a show last night, and they're smoking pot in there.
1883780	1886780	And I've done shows where they smoke pot at the ice house.
1886780	1889780	I've been there in order to pot.
1889780	1891780	I know we're a podcast live audience.
1891780	1892780	I'm going to focus more on the podcast.
1892780	1893780	Oh, good.
1893780	1894780	That's my thing.
1894780	1896780	Well, I think they were left out of their foot fetish stuff.
1896780	1897780	Oh, okay.
1897780	1899780	I don't really have a foot fetish.
1899780	1904780	I mean, I have one time I have, I did something with a sock, I think,
1904780	1906780	one time, a girl's sock.
1906780	1907780	I don't know.
1907780	1914780	On the tree of foot fetishes, because I'm a heavy duty leg man,
1914780	1919780	and like a nylon guy, and because the leg terminates at this beautiful part
1919780	1922780	of the equally feminine part of the feminine leg.
1922780	1926780	You love legs and you love terminus.
1926780	1931780	But then there's a branch of the whole, when you say foot fetish,
1931780	1936780	it gets into like, I want someone to walk in chocolate and then walk on my face
1936780	1941780	and masturbate me with their toes, and I want to eat the toes
1941780	1943780	when you put the other toe in the butt and stuff.
1943780	1947780	I'm not that focused on the foot.
1947780	1950780	It's just like the foot is a beautiful little period on the sentence
1950780	1952780	that is a woman's leg.
1952780	1956780	I got called out for looking at a girl's foot in ninth grade.
1956780	1960780	I remember at Vivoli, I grew up here in the valley, San Fernando Valley,
1960780	1964780	and she was like, you know, in the 80s, I'm not going to say like a stoner's chick,
1964780	1968780	but she smokes cigarettes, and I remember I was like looking at her feet.
1968780	1969780	She was, why are you looking at my feet?
1969780	1972780	And I was just like, just into it.
1972780	1976780	I was really, I don't think I need the dipped in chocolate.
1976780	1977780	I like looking at them.
1977780	1980780	I would do what you said with the feet on the penis.
1980780	1981780	I'm okay with that.
1981780	1984780	When I was in high school, like late high school and early college,
1984780	1989780	my friend Chris, he would have these parties, and his father was a sheriff,
1989780	1994780	and they were awesome because we went into the parents' room one time
1994780	1999780	and there was tons of bondage gear, like lots of fucking chains and whips
1999780	2003780	and strap-ons and all kinds of good like get it on kind of shit.
2003780	2007780	Between, you know, like late 40s husband and wife,
2007780	2009780	they didn't care that we would have these parties,
2009780	2011780	and everybody would get naked in their jacuzzi,
2011780	2013780	and everybody would suck each other's toes.
2013780	2016780	Shrimp jobs? Shrimpin?
2016780	2018780	Shrimp, shrimp, shrimp job.
2018780	2020780	We called it shrimp jobs.
2020780	2024780	Which made the unsexy even less sexy.
2024780	2027780	But we would all suck each other's toes, and it was good fun.
2027780	2032780	Because in the jacuzzi, you're all boiled up, you know, you're all, you know.
2032780	2035780	Like all the pathogens have been cooked up.
2035780	2038780	If you're going to suck a toe, you should...
2038780	2040780	Yeah, that would be the spot to do it.
2040780	2044780	Yeah, a pool of hot water would be a good place to get started, I think.
2044780	2049780	When you're looking at feet on the internet, like what is the...
2049780	2051780	What's going on through your mind?
2051780	2053780	What's the fantasy that's happening?
2053780	2058780	You know, I'm looking, and I just like, it doesn't go beyond that.
2058780	2062780	A fetish is like, it's like the object itself is like this thing
2062780	2065780	that's more important than anything, and it's a really interesting question
2065780	2069780	because I think, and I think that's part of what makes me, you know,
2069780	2073780	potentially asexual sometimes, my behavior.
2073780	2077780	Like if I'm working, and I'm too busy, and then I'm so, I'm like,
2077780	2083780	okay, I'm going to gratify myself because, you know, well, a nice excuse is,
2083780	2086780	hey, who wants to get prostate cancer?
2086780	2088780	You got to come constantly, right?
2088780	2090780	That's true.
2090780	2091780	So like...
2091780	2092780	Is that true?
2092780	2094780	Yeah, they got Ernest Borgnine.
2094780	2097780	I think he recently passed, maybe, but he was like 95.
2097780	2098780	He was on Conan.
2098780	2102780	He said he masturbated like all the time, every day,
2102780	2105780	and that's what led him to be happy and live that long.
2105780	2107780	You guys remember that a couple years ago?
2107780	2108780	Thank you. Thank you.
2108780	2109780	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
2109780	2110780	Thank you. Thank you.
2110780	2111780	We're all going to live forever then.
2111780	2113780	Last night in Toronto, they wouldn't have agreed.
2113780	2115780	They would have just left me out there hanging.
2115780	2117780	The Canadian audience are a little more laid back.
2117780	2118780	Yeah.
2118780	2119780	They're not responsive.
2119780	2120780	Well, they were also super high.
2120780	2122780	That's true.
2123780	2125780	Also, Toronto, they have the street meat.
2125780	2127780	They have those fucking carts with the hot dogs and stuff,
2127780	2128780	and it's quite good.
2128780	2129780	Oh, yeah.
2129780	2132780	I had shawarma last night, and I love Zancou.
2132780	2133780	It's right up the street.
2133780	2134780	I go there all the time.
2134780	2137780	I'm a proud member of the Zancou Army,
2137780	2139780	but I went to a place...
2139780	2143780	I mean, it said it was falafel king.
2143780	2145780	It looked like a chain thing, but it wasn't,
2145780	2147780	and I went in there, and they're just very nice,
2147780	2153780	and I had a chicken tiki marsala or something like that.
2153780	2156780	It was good.
2156780	2160780	It was better than Zancou, and I hate to say that.
2160780	2161780	You're welcome.
2161780	2163780	So Toronto is multicultural.
2163780	2164780	It's great.
2164780	2165780	People get along.
2165780	2167780	I grew up here in Los Angeles.
2167780	2169780	People don't get along.
2169780	2170780	I lived in New York.
2170780	2172780	People actually get along in New York.
2172780	2173780	You have to.
2173780	2174780	You're together.
2174780	2177780	I grew up here, valley, busing.
2177780	2178780	I've been all around.
2178780	2182780	And you were talking about, you know, asexuality
2182780	2185780	and things of that, and if you do listen to my podcast,
2185780	2193780	maybe nine months ago, I did come out on my podcast.
2193780	2198780	I am 10% gay.
2198780	2199780	Thank you.
2199780	2200780	Thank you.
2200780	2203780	I mean, I went to Bangkok, and I pushed it to the limit.
2204780	2207780	You were talking about strap-ons and Adam's apples.
2207780	2212780	I got pulled into the night of Bangkok, and I went there.
2212780	2214780	Well, let's be more specific, Brody.
2214780	2215780	I can't be too...
2215780	2216780	Well, you know what?
2216780	2220780	I think the more I talk about it, the more comfortable I'll get with it,
2220780	2226780	and I can really chisel down that story for my one-man show.
2226780	2230780	Wait, you had a ladyboy encounter in Bangkok?
2230780	2231780	You know what?
2231780	2232780	Yeah.
2232780	2233780	You were up to it.
2233780	2234780	Yes.
2234780	2235780	Good for you.
2235780	2236780	Three people applauding me.
2236780	2238780	Everyone else, gay bash.
2238780	2240780	10% gay bashing.
2240780	2245780	But I only call the Bangkok experience because we all go there.
2245780	2249780	If you ask, that is almost accepted over there.
2249780	2250780	So I count that.
2250780	2252780	It's like a 4%.
2252780	2255780	Now, did you go out in search of a ladyboy experience,
2255780	2258780	or did the ladyboy find you by accident?
2258780	2259780	Oh, you go.
2259780	2260780	You hang out.
2260780	2264780	I was over there working on a project, and you hang out, and you go.
2264780	2265780	It's very...
2265780	2268780	You know, it's a nice culture.
2268780	2273780	They're very outgoing, massage, and haircut late at night.
2273780	2274780	All that stuff.
2274780	2276780	Like, it's a good vibe.
2276780	2278780	So you go to these club...
2278780	2282780	I could go for a late-night haircut.
2282780	2286780	And then a hand job from a guy named Kim.
2286780	2287780	Oh, it's funny.
2287780	2288780	You know, funny, you should...
2288780	2291780	I'll tell you about that off camera.
2291780	2293780	Funny, you should say Kim.
2293780	2294780	But I'll get back to that.
2294780	2295780	Why is that?
2295780	2299780	Well, it's a code word for something that I...
2299780	2300780	No, it's...
2300780	2302780	I'll tell you off camera.
2302780	2303780	Off mic.
2303780	2306780	Look, if you're coming on to me, just fucking get it out.
2306780	2307780	No, I'm not...
2307780	2308780	No, I'm not gay like that.
2308780	2309780	See?
2309780	2310780	See?
2310780	2311780	It's not that way.
2311780	2313780	They're talking about, do I see a guy, like, whoever you're talking about,
2313780	2317780	like, oh, he's got great legs and great chest,
2317780	2322780	and I want to kiss his thick beard.
2322780	2323780	No, I'm not into that.
2323780	2324780	All right?
2324780	2326780	So that's not what a lady boy is.
2326780	2327780	Thank you.
2327780	2329780	Because they take hormones.
2329780	2330780	Now...
2330780	2335780	So I went over there to see, all right?
2335780	2337780	And I walk around.
2337780	2338780	I see my mannerisms.
2338780	2341780	You know, I got picked on a lot because I was a nice guy,
2341780	2344780	like, I'm a happy guy, and kids are cruel.
2344780	2346780	And I grew up here in the Valley, a Jewish kid.
2346780	2348780	I should have been sheltered by Libra's school.
2348780	2350780	You sound like you're from Chicago.
2350780	2351780	How'd you get that?
2351780	2352780	Well, I was in Toronto over the weekend.
2352780	2354780	I think that's Chicago.
2354780	2356780	I think the Chicago jet stream.
2356780	2358780	You don't sound like you were raised in California.
2358780	2359780	I know.
2359780	2360780	I've heard that a lot.
2360780	2362780	I grew up in the Valley, I think because I'm kind of nasally.
2362780	2364780	I always would get New York.
2364780	2365780	New York City.
2365780	2367780	I lived in Brooklyn for three years.
2367780	2369780	Williamsburg, L-Train, before it got hip.
2369780	2371780	I was there.
2371780	2373780	Three years in Seattle.
2373780	2374780	Okay, sorry, Jeff.
2374780	2375780	So you're fucking this lady boy?
2375780	2378780	I'm the one, you know what?
2378780	2379780	I'll tell you what.
2379780	2382780	If I did that, that ain't so bad.
2382780	2384780	That ain't so bad.
2384780	2385780	I watch Locked Up Rock.
2385780	2387780	It ain't that bad.
2387780	2389780	Nobody in Hermitown is going to judge you.
2389780	2390780	Yeah.
2390780	2392780	Well, I feel like first three...
2392780	2393780	No, no, no.
2393780	2395780	But you know how hard that is?
2395780	2396780	I mean, it's...
2396780	2399780	I'm okay with it, and then I'll tell you what.
2399780	2402780	I came back to the mainland,
2402780	2406780	and I went a little further just to see.
2406780	2409780	Just to see that line and maybe go over it.
2409780	2412780	What did that entail?
2412780	2415780	There was a hotel in Hollywood, and...
2415780	2417780	Freaked out, doesn't it, people?
2417780	2418780	No, freaked out.
2418780	2419780	Brody, nobody...
2419780	2421780	This is why people stay in the closet.
2421780	2422780	Brody.
2422780	2424780	I'm 10% gay, and it's scary.
2424780	2427780	Brody, you're 50% gay.
2427780	2428780	No, I'm not Jeff!
2428780	2429780	How dare you!
2429780	2430780	Brody.
2431780	2435780	This audience is so accustomed to hearing so much worse
2435780	2436780	and so much more bizarre.
2436780	2437780	Oh, thank you.
2437780	2438780	Thank you.
2438780	2439780	Well, you know, I play baseball.
2439780	2441780	I just feel like it's going to come back on me.
2441780	2443780	It's okay to be gay, Brody.
2443780	2444780	I'm saying it's okay.
2444780	2447780	But I told you I'm not into hand-holding.
2452780	2454780	I am into human love.
2454780	2455780	That's good.
2455780	2456780	So...
2456780	2458780	What happened to the hotel?
2458780	2460780	You know, well, Kim...
2460780	2461780	Excuse me.
2461780	2462780	Kim!
2462780	2463780	Kim.
2463780	2465780	AKA, I can't give the name away, but...
2465780	2466780	You know what?
2466780	2467780	I'll tell you what.
2467780	2468780	The TS community...
2468780	2470780	I'm very active in the TS community.
2470780	2471780	What's TS?
2471780	2472780	Transsexual.
2472780	2473780	Oh, okay.
2473780	2474780	And...
2474780	2477780	When you say active in the community, what do you mean?
2477780	2479780	I just like saying that.
2481780	2482780	Because you know what?
2482780	2483780	It's very popular.
2483780	2485780	If you were to go...
2485780	2489780	Back in the day, my friends ran Taboo Video up in Seattle,
2489780	2493780	which was the number one grossing adult video store in Seattle.
2493780	2496780	This was right before DVDs started coming out.
2496780	2497780	And the number one...
2497780	2501780	And probably to this day, if you ask the guys who still make it,
2501780	2502780	the number one...
2502780	2503780	It's TS stuff.
2503780	2505780	That's the number one thing for whatever reason.
2505780	2508780	Does that mean, like, chicks with dicks?
2508780	2509780	Yeah, that's what it is.
2509780	2513780	Because you see a breast, and you're into that,
2513780	2516780	and you're into this face, and the hair, they look good.
2516780	2519780	They're like, there's no problems.
2519780	2521780	And then you go, is it a girl?
2521780	2522780	I don't know.
2522780	2523780	I'm in Bangkok.
2523780	2526780	Something got shaved down.
2526780	2527780	Is this...
2527780	2528780	You gotta like...
2528780	2530780	It's the 60s all over again.
2530780	2532780	It's rock and roll.
2532780	2533780	I'm a comedian.
2533780	2537780	I felt like I had to kind of do that to share that story with you
2537780	2540780	as a guy who wants to move on and...
2540780	2542780	Don't bring us into it.
2542780	2543780	Yeah.
2543780	2544780	Oh, no.
2544780	2545780	I mean...
2545780	2549780	You're following some sort of trail.
2549780	2551780	You're certainly going down some sort of...
2551780	2554780	I think that as you age and as you progress,
2554780	2558780	your fetishes do kind of start meandering towards more specific things.
2558780	2560780	Wouldn't you say?
2560780	2561780	Yeah.
2561780	2564780	But today, I was in Starbucks, and I was sitting there,
2564780	2568780	and I saw a girl with a nice butt,
2568780	2571780	and I just wanted to put my face in it.
2571780	2573780	And I confirmed to me right there, I'm not...
2573780	2577780	What gay guy wants to put his face in a girl's butt?
2577780	2578780	I did.
2578780	2579780	That just confirmed...
2579780	2580780	There's my 90%.
2580780	2582780	We didn't say that you were gay.
2582780	2583780	I am 10%.
2583780	2584780	I will stick with that figure.
2584780	2585780	I'm gonna put it at 48.
2585780	2586780	Are you?
2586780	2587780	I mean, 48.
2587780	2588780	48.
2588780	2589780	Is this a new segment?
2589780	2591780	It's like guessing someone's weight.
2591780	2594780	Are you gonna work at a carnival and just...
2594780	2597780	Dan's only at 22.
2597780	2599780	Okay.
2600780	2603780	The percentage thing raises interesting questions,
2603780	2604780	because how do you go...
2604780	2608780	Because it all has to do with the amount of repression
2608780	2610780	in the society that you're in the context of,
2610780	2614780	because if you're in a society that, for instance,
2614780	2618780	views sexual preference as a binary dichotomy,
2618780	2624780	then that puts a lot of significance on the difference between 49% and 50%,
2624780	2628780	because I'm assuming, just being sort of a computer programmer of old,
2629780	2632780	but if you're living in a genuinely...
2632780	2635780	If you're living in an open field after some kind of nuclear holocaust
2635780	2638780	and everyone's just running around in deerskin togas
2638780	2640780	and using bottle caps for money,
2640780	2644780	and there's no more magazine covers or search billboards
2644780	2646780	to kind of drive home anything,
2646780	2649780	then the difference between 20% and 30% is what?
2649780	2650780	I mean, we don't even...
2650780	2651780	Yeah.
2651780	2652780	I will definitely agree.
2652780	2656780	What in the world would be the meaning of 100% heterosexual?
2656780	2659780	I think whatever that would manifest itself as
2659780	2661780	would certainly appear, I would imagine,
2661780	2664780	to be less straight than what we consider straight.
2664780	2665780	We don't want...
2665780	2669780	Nobody likes anybody that's overtly masculine,
2669780	2671780	or we don't like people that are overtly feminine.
2671780	2672780	We don't like...
2672780	2674780	She's being such a girl right now,
2674780	2676780	or a guy who's being such a guy.
2676780	2679780	I'm a die-fucking-dude, chicken wings for the...
2679780	2680780	Yeah!
2680780	2681780	We don't like that, and we don't like,
2681780	2683780	Oh, my God, go to the mall shopping.
2683780	2684780	We don't like that either.
2684780	2685780	And so we also...
2685780	2686780	We don't like...
2686780	2687780	I mean...
2687780	2688780	I won't say we.
2688780	2689780	I'll say I.
2689780	2692780	When you meet a gay guy, let's say,
2692780	2695780	and he's really queeny, that wears you out pretty quickly.
2695780	2698780	It's like enough with the femininity thing.
2698780	2700780	Like temper that a little bit.
2700780	2702780	The more towards the middle you get,
2702780	2704780	the more complete of a person you become.
2704780	2705780	Sure.
2705780	2707780	We don't want to see a really butch lesbian...
2707780	2710780	Oh, I don't want to walk my dog about that.
2710780	2713780	How about be a woman, too, while you're being a man?
2713780	2715780	Like lean towards the middle.
2715780	2717780	And I would say towards all things.
2717780	2719780	Like see both sides of everything,
2719780	2723780	and kind of combine the beauty that is masculinity
2723780	2725780	and the beauty that is femininity.
2725780	2726780	Well, that's what I'm saying.
2726780	2727780	Look at the...
2727780	2730780	So I think nature goes in bell curves.
2730780	2731780	I think that's a...
2731780	2734780	I mean, that's probably pinning things in too much, too,
2734780	2736780	but that's an easier way to understand things.
2736780	2740780	That if a frog lays a thousand eggs,
2741780	2743780	then you're going to look at...
2743780	2748780	There's a bulge in the center of the survival eggs, you know?
2748780	2751780	And then there's fringe eggs that don't survive for one reason
2751780	2754780	and fringe eggs that don't survive for another reason.
2754780	2756780	Everything goes in a bell curve.
2756780	2758780	So IQs.
2758780	2762780	There's not a lot of incredibly stupid people.
2762780	2764780	There's a bunch of people in the middle
2764780	2766780	that are running everything.
2766780	2769780	And then there's not a lot of incredibly smart people
2769780	2772780	who are all here tonight.
2772780	2775780	But sexually, so sexually...
2775780	2777780	Give yourselves a round of applause.
2777780	2779780	If you think of sexuality as a bell curve,
2779780	2780780	then I would assume...
2780780	2785780	I think what you're saying, that 100% straight means
2785780	2787780	actually some kind of weird inside out,
2787780	2789780	weird thing where you're so straight, you're not even human.
2789780	2790780	Yeah.
2790780	2792780	Because the bell curve would probably be,
2792780	2794780	well, if I put my penis through a hole
2794780	2796780	and I don't know what's sucking it,
2796780	2798780	and then later I find out it was my friend Kevin,
2799780	2801780	in other words...
2801780	2802780	Like 2%.
2802780	2804780	That's an ass.
2804780	2806780	I imagine that those of us in the middle
2806780	2808780	are people whose sexuality doesn't define us
2808780	2812780	so much that it prevents us from doing other things.
2812780	2815780	The same way that an incredibly sober person
2815780	2818780	whose sobriety defines every conversation they have
2818780	2820780	is just as annoying as a fall-down drunk
2820780	2822780	who you can't trust to...
2822780	2824780	And there's nothing more fascist than a hippie.
2824780	2827780	Like a really hardcore hippie can be the most fascistic,
2827780	2830780	most dogmatic asshole you'll ever talk to.
2830780	2831780	Yeah.
2831780	2833780	Like temper it a little bit, like see both sides of it.
2833780	2835780	It's hilarious, like in NASCAR,
2835780	2837780	once in a while for breast cancer awareness,
2837780	2839780	they'll paint one car pink,
2839780	2841780	and there's people that are really bummed out about it.
2841780	2843780	It's like, I'm a pink car, goddamn!
2843780	2846780	Like, I'm not a man anymore.
2846780	2848780	I can't look at a pink car go in a circle.
2848780	2850780	Like, it's like, hey.
2850780	2853780	Hey, if you could like the color pink a little more,
2853780	2855780	you'd fuck your wife a little better
2855780	2856780	and fucking take it easy.
2857780	2858780	Yeah.
2858780	2861780	I wear polarized gray pants.
2861780	2863780	Every white car is pink.
2867780	2869780	You're back down to 10% again.
2869780	2871780	There you go, back down.
2871780	2873780	Are you sure you didn't wash your white car
2873780	2875780	with a pink bicycle?
2875780	2876780	Oh, shit, a red bicycle.
2876780	2877780	God damn it.
2877780	2878780	I fucked up.
2880780	2882780	You guys are talking about...
2882780	2883780	Feet?
2883780	2885780	No, the language is...
2887780	2889780	I'm with you on that, on language.
2889780	2891780	I want to go on a whole thing on that.
2891780	2893780	I mean, Jeff goes on these tears.
2893780	2896780	Like, he's a real H.L. Menken,
2896780	2898780	like, really thinks that everyone should be, you know,
2898780	2900780	going about talking like a steampunk person,
2900780	2902780	otherwise that means that we're regressing.
2902780	2904780	We should use our...
2904780	2907780	The English language is one of the most expansive vocabularies
2907780	2908780	of all time.
2908780	2910780	It's one of the biggest vocabularies I've ever made.
2910780	2911780	And we don't fucking use it.
2911780	2913780	I like to use it more.
2913780	2915780	I like to use it more.
2915780	2917780	Yeah, absolutely.
2917780	2919780	But I will...
2919780	2922780	So I think where I agree with Jeff
2922780	2926780	is that there's a danger in getting trained
2926780	2929780	by media and each other
2929780	2933780	that everything is either awesome or lame.
2933780	2936780	If there's no more words for different kinds of awesome,
2936780	2938780	like, yeah, you're getting trained
2938780	2940780	to choose between Pepsi and Coke.
2940780	2942780	They're fooling you into not realizing
2942780	2944780	that there's a difference between corn syrup and water.
2944780	2947780	So linguistically, we need to think outside the box.
2947780	2951780	But that is exactly why I bristle and freak out,
2951780	2954780	get very uncomfortable when people campaign
2954780	2956780	and parade and things in celebration
2956780	2959780	of just scrubbing out those couple little words.
2959780	2960780	Yeah.
2960780	2962780	Because it's like it doesn't...
2962780	2964780	You don't even see where that stops.
2964780	2965780	You just...
2965780	2966780	You think that...
2966780	2969780	When you don't make up words for a living,
2969780	2971780	like, maybe it's harder to see
2971780	2973780	how you can't just point at something
2973780	2974780	on the other side of the room and go,
2974780	2976780	I want that potted plant out of here.
2976780	2978780	Now the apartment's gonna be perfect.
2978780	2981780	You know, that's not how it works.
2981780	2983780	Like, you're free or you're not.
2983780	2987780	You come out of the womb with the freedom of speech.
2987780	2990780	The Constitution gets drafted up by some lawyers
2990780	2992780	and says you have freedom of speech.
2992780	2994780	Next thing that happens is,
2994780	2996780	unless you say fire in a crowded theater,
2996780	2997780	next thing that happens is,
2997780	2999780	unless you say this thing and that thing,
2999780	3002780	we can all agree that this would be a terrible thing to say.
3002780	3003780	Yes, okay.
3003780	3005780	All in favor of eliminating it?
3005780	3006780	Aye, aye, aye.
3006780	3007780	This...
3007780	3008780	Whatever, man.
3008780	3009780	This is why...
3009780	3010780	What a boring conversation.
3010780	3011780	It's not boring.
3011780	3012780	I'm right there with you, Dan.
3012780	3013780	It's the same thing.
3013780	3015780	We're talking about a binary idea
3015780	3016780	that there's good and there's bad.
3016780	3017780	There's Pepsi, there's Coke,
3017780	3018780	there's straight or there's gay.
3018780	3020780	I don't like non-lateral thinking.
3020780	3021780	But here's the thing.
3021780	3023780	Yeah, I also don't like people
3023780	3025780	that aren't verbal thinkers necessarily
3025780	3027780	who think that they shouldn't speak
3027780	3031780	because they don't have the same kind of word power.
3031780	3033780	You know, I don't like those people
3033780	3035780	feeling censored by smart people.
3035780	3037780	I don't like people being bullied
3037780	3039780	because they don't know how to use an apostrophe.
3039780	3044780	I don't think that someone who speaks great truths
3044780	3045780	is necessarily going to be
3045780	3047780	the most articulate person in the world.
3047780	3050780	I think that the use of seven words,
3050780	3051780	if there's only seven,
3051780	3054780	we can still create a revolution
3054780	3057780	and someone can use those seven words
3057780	3060780	in an order that's going to make everybody flip over.
3060780	3062780	There's a way to speak wrong so well
3062780	3064780	that you're amazing, like Yogi Berra.
3064780	3068780	If you go online and look up Yogi Berra quotes,
3068780	3070780	he malapropped all the time.
3070780	3073780	Malapropism is a Shakespeare character, malaprop.
3073780	3075780	He constantly said things wrong
3075780	3078780	and it was using the language perfectly.
3078780	3079780	And you can't tell at some point.
3079780	3082780	Did he say it wrong on purpose or by accident?
3082780	3084780	Because he said something really, really funny,
3084780	3086780	really, really, really good.
3086780	3088780	I was going to tie this in.
3088780	3091780	I played baseball at Arizona State, number one.
3091780	3092780	Played there, started.
3092780	3093780	What position?
3093780	3094780	I was a pitcher.
3094780	3095780	I could see you as a pitcher.
3095780	3096780	Thank you.
3096780	3097780	Thank you.
3097780	3099780	I think you're 10% catcher.
3099780	3101780	Okay, all right, all right.
3101780	3102780	Thanks a lot.
3102780	3103780	Good night, everybody.
3103780	3104780	No, come on, come on.
3104780	3114780	We might have the name of our episode, though.
3114780	3117780	Aren't we all 10% catcher in some way?
3117780	3125780	So I think some of that comes from being in that jock world,
3125780	3128780	not being in the artist world.
3128780	3134780	I definitely have those jock energy and experiences
3134780	3139780	and also my pre-comedy experiences to, you know,
3139780	3142780	that really kind of like I carry with me
3142780	3144780	and not necessarily in a good way.
3144780	3147780	And then sometimes I'll see myself on,
3147780	3149780	like I'm working on a project also
3149780	3152780	and I can go into like how we argue over words
3152780	3154780	and argue over comedy.
3154780	3155780	And then I think like who are you?
3155780	3157780	Where's your, you know,
3157780	3160780	I don't want to go into like specifics here,
3160780	3161780	but yeah, there's kind of debates
3161780	3164780	and I feel like I don't get that freedom.
3164780	3166780	That's one reason why I do podcasts,
3166780	3168780	because I get that freedom to talk
3168780	3171780	and maybe it's because I'm Jewish or I'm neurotic
3171780	3173780	or there's heart disease in my family.
3173780	3174780	I got to get it out.
3174780	3177780	And when I don't, and it really is hard
3177780	3180780	when it's your living or your own production
3180780	3184780	and it's your own, you know, introduction to America
3184780	3188780	and it's truly not you getting to do that.
3188780	3191780	So I'm dealing with that and I think it's all a combination
3191780	3193780	and a hybrid of everything.
3193780	3195780	You know, hopefully when I come out on either side,
3195780	3197780	I'll grow from it, but.
3197780	3198780	Yeah, I don't know you very well,
3198780	3199780	but like from what little I know,
3199780	3201780	like I'm just from hearing you tonight,
3201780	3203780	like you're revealing stuff about yourself,
3203780	3205780	but also you're hard on yourself about it.
3205780	3206780	Yeah, a little toward.
3206780	3208780	Like it's almost like you're, like not to overstate it,
3208780	3210780	like it's almost like you're kind of gay bashing yourself
3210780	3212780	about a gay experience.
3212780	3215780	Like you're saying, hey, I did this thing
3215780	3218780	and I'm not proud of it, but you're.
3218780	3221780	Well, I mean, growing up, I was called, oh, gay boy.
3221780	3224780	You're, I was a nice guy, a nice kid.
3224780	3227780	You know, now being nice, I think in Hollywood
3227780	3229780	or whatever we call this has helped me
3229780	3232780	because people want nice people around, you know,
3232780	3234780	and hustling and hard work, which I got, you know,
3234780	3236780	helped me in baseball.
3236780	3238780	But I think growing up, maybe in the Valley at the time,
3238780	3241780	going to public, going to public schools,
3241780	3243780	getting bust out to South Central,
3243780	3245780	maybe it made me tougher, I don't know,
3245780	3247780	and then playing baseball with like,
3247780	3250780	not necessarily a little bit of hazing and bowling.
3250780	3252780	It was kind of, yeah, like stuck with me.
3252780	3254780	And then when I started doing comedy, like,
3254780	3257780	ah, opened up a lot, but now when I see myself on TV,
3257780	3261780	sometimes I kind of see like, I would pick on myself.
3261780	3263780	Yeah, and I don't know what that is.
3263780	3264780	I don't know where that comes from.
3264780	3266780	Well, that's just your own self-loathing problem.
3266780	3267780	Yeah, well.
3267780	3269780	It's probably something that we don't all see,
3269780	3272780	that it's something that you trained yourself to.
3272780	3274780	But I've learned, I've learned, you know,
3274780	3277780	especially lately, like turn it into comedy,
3277780	3279780	turn it into something, use it as a positive.
3279780	3281780	And I get a lot of support from people.
3281780	3284780	Again, I'm older and, you know, Twitter and the internet
3284780	3286780	and all that stuff, like, it has helped me
3286780	3288780	and doing the podcast.
3288780	3290780	There's things like, you seem like a very soft,
3290780	3292780	like emotionally very soft guy,
3292780	3294780	but you exude a very, like your voice,
3294780	3297780	your posture is very like loud and like,
3297780	3301780	you seem very sportsy and very like macho and gruff,
3301780	3304780	but like you can still like, you can't totally hide the fact
3304780	3308780	that there's a softness to you, which is not gay.
3308780	3310780	It's just being soft.
3310780	3312780	And, you know, but that's a negative,
3312780	3314780	that's kind of a negative term in sports,
3314780	3315780	if you're labeled as soft.
3315780	3317780	Yeah, but we're not playing sports.
3317780	3318780	We're not playing sports.
3318780	3319780	So I'm okay with that.
3319780	3324780	And I am getting used to that.
3324780	3327780	And it's just, maybe it's some of those jock sensibilities in me
3327780	3330780	and the fact that I'm still around that world a little bit.
3330780	3332780	I'm around Major League Baseball.
3332780	3334780	You certainly take a major step by talking about
3334780	3336780	your lady boy experience in Thailand.
3336780	3337780	Well, you know, it is.
3337780	3339780	I'm getting it out there and it's also just other things.
3339780	3342780	Talking about it, owning it and, you know, again,
3342780	3345780	not being hard on myself and then, you know,
3345780	3347780	I don't want to, you just keep doing it.
3347780	3350780	And I think you just work through it and the fans and the,
3350780	3353780	it's like, I don't need therapy, to be honest with you.
3353780	3355780	And I do speak loud.
3355780	3357780	I mean, I am, and that's one thing I do kind of like,
3357780	3361780	I do the sensitivity because I am a nice guy and I'll put it out
3361780	3363780	and it's like, well, you're being loud, you're this.
3363780	3367780	And it's like, professionally, I have learned like how to do warmup
3367780	3371780	and I start off nice.
3371780	3372780	Okay, we're going to do this.
3372780	3373780	And then I crank it.
3373780	3375780	You know, I work at the midnight show with Chris Hardwick kind of thing.
3375780	3377780	It go in nice, nice, nice.
3377780	3378780	We don't want you to be quiet.
3378780	3379780	We want you to be loud.
3379780	3380780	You want it.
3380780	3382780	Yeah, because there's a little audience and that's the,
3382780	3384780	what I think about is like, all right, I'm doing a podcast.
3384780	3387780	I've had some experiences when I've done video podcasts
3387780	3390780	and like I've played completely to the camera
3390780	3393780	and then people in the podcast feel like, oh, it's too much.
3393780	3394780	And now I'm doing a live show.
3394780	3397780	I can play to the audience and I feel like maybe the podcast,
3397780	3398780	a lot of things going on.
3398780	3399780	But you know what?
3399780	3403780	I'm comfortable here with Dan, Jeff, Dustin and the.
3403780	3404780	What's the fear?
3404780	3405780	Okay.
3405780	3407780	What's the fear, Brody, that like, like, I'm sorry to cut you off.
3407780	3408780	That's okay.
3408780	3412780	I like what would be the big, we talked about this.
3412780	3416780	I think last time about the way we're perceived or a couple of shows ago
3416780	3420780	about we all exude something that we're not in control of that.
3420780	3425780	Like Dan wants to be perceived as a smart and also people come to him
3425780	3428780	and want, they want Dan to say that, that he's smart.
3428780	3431780	Like what's, what's, what do you want people to see you as?
3431780	3434780	Or what are you afraid that people see in you that you wish they didn't see?
3435780	3439780	Um, weird.
3439780	3440780	Weird how?
3440780	3443780	Just weird thinking about stuff that doesn't matter.
3443780	3445780	You know, like, I mean, that's a whole nother thing.
3445780	3446780	I was asking.
3446780	3448780	What's the fear of being perceived as weird?
3448780	3449780	I don't want to be.
3449780	3451780	It's like, so it's like a Pandora's box.
3451780	3452780	It's like you talk about it.
3452780	3454780	You bring attention to it.
3454780	3456780	It's like, you know, things that we notice.
3456780	3457780	I'm sure, you know, you're an actor.
3457780	3458780	You see yourself on TV.
3458780	3460780	Like some people can't watch themselves.
3460780	3462780	Johnny Depp doesn't watch his movies.
3462780	3464780	Jared Leto freaked out.
3464780	3466780	You know, I know that's there.
3466780	3468780	You know, that's normal, but it feels like it's a,
3468780	3470780	it affects me a little bit more.
3470780	3473780	Um, but you're, you're doing a comedy central show now, right?
3473780	3474780	Are you?
3474780	3475780	Yeah, I'm doing that.
3475780	3477780	And some of that has seen myself on that.
3477780	3479780	My fear, like that's all I was thinking about.
3479780	3483780	Like my fear regarding that would be one weird.
3483780	3486780	So that's kind of, I don't want people to think you're weird.
3486780	3490780	I don't mind it, but I don't want it to be a Pandora's box of weirdness.
3490780	3493780	If we could turn into a joke, you mean they're going to find out you're weird.
3493780	3494780	In what way?
3494780	3498780	Like what's what's like obsessive about my eyebrows weird about my hairline.
3498780	3499780	My mannerisms.
3499780	3501780	Do I think I'm gay?
3501780	3503780	Why do you even think you're, you know, that kind of stuff.
3503780	3504780	Okay.
3504780	3507780	And if you revealed all that, if you took off your hat and showed us your hair on your eyebrows,
3507780	3508780	I'll do that.
3508780	3509780	I'm bold.
3509780	3510780	I'm bold.
3510780	3512780	It doesn't bother me, but I just felt cooler doing this today.
3512780	3513780	Yeah.
3513780	3514780	And I was in Toronto.
3514780	3515780	Yeah.
3515780	3516780	It's off.
3516780	3517780	It's off.
3518780	3520780	Hiding behind some stuff.
3520780	3521780	The glasses kind of.
3521780	3522780	Believe me.
3522780	3523780	I hide behind a suit.
3523780	3525780	I hide behind a weird hairdo all the time.
3525780	3526780	Great hair.
3526780	3527780	Well, thank you.
3527780	3528780	But it's all an act.
3528780	3529780	It's all affectation.
3529780	3532780	I hide behind my aunt Rachel's beautiful pantyhose clad legs.
3537780	3539780	I just play with my matchbox cars.
3539780	3542780	Rolling them gently up and down her calves.
3542780	3544780	Is that where it comes from?
3544780	3546780	I feel like researching that stuff.
3546780	3547780	Did she have red hair?
3547780	3548780	Oh, I don't know.
3548780	3551780	I had an aunt that had red hair that married into the family.
3551780	3555780	No, I was into redheads since Nicole McHugh and kindergarten.
3555780	3557780	Who's Nicole McHugh?
3557780	3558780	Who wasn't she?
3559780	3566780	Nicole McHugh was the first girl that I ever felt hormones generated in my body about.
3566780	3570780	It was kindergarten and the teachers would call your name.
3570780	3574780	And then every time the teacher would call my name, she'd say,
3574780	3577780	Daniel Harmon, Nicole McHugh would go...
3579780	3582780	And then every time she'd say, Nicole McHugh, I'd go...
3583780	3585780	And we never spoke.
3586780	3587780	We never spoke to each other.
3587780	3589780	But she was my first lover.
3589780	3592780	Well, that's one of the most beautiful relationships I've ever heard of.
3592780	3595780	And she had copper, red, curly hair.
3597780	3600780	But so did Batgirl, so I don't know where it came from.
3601780	3605780	Because Batgirl was a huge... A cork got popped there sexually.
3606780	3607780	I would get so excited.
3607780	3609780	The opening credits of Batman.
3609780	3611780	My brother would be like...
3611780	3614780	My brother loved Batman and we would play Batman together.
3614780	3621780	We'd put ski caps and stuff on the banister to the basement and pretend it was the Bat-pole.
3621780	3623780	And get dressed up as Bat...
3623780	3625780	Get to the bottom of the stairs and go, I heard the Joker's broken out.
3625780	3626780	Let's go get him.
3627780	3629780	And we'd watch Batman together.
3629780	3632780	And then there was a title card in the Batman title sequence.
3633780	3636780	Because now being a producer, I guess I know that...
3636780	3639780	It must have meant that Von Craig was probably 6 of 13 or something.
3639780	3642780	Like she was recurring but not regular.
3642780	3646780	And so there was an opening title card that was either there or not there.
3646780	3651780	And it wasn't a picture of Batgirl, but it was always there when she was going to be in the episode, I would say.
3651780	3653780	And so and so was Batgirl.
3653780	3656780	And my body would just twitch.
3656780	3663780	Even though I was absolutely years and years away from generating any kind of fluid that would have anything to do with that.
3663780	3668780	I was just transfixed and I was so excited that Batgirl was going to be involved.
3668780	3673780	And that she would be flying around whipping her red wig around and kicking people.
3673780	3677780	And very often getting Batman...
3677780	3680780	There was a lot of nylon or spandex or whatever.
3680780	3682780	And a lot of bondage.
3682780	3683780	A lot of like...
3683780	3685780	Which I'm not a bondage guy.
3685780	3690780	But a lot of when I was a kid, it was a lot of like...
3690780	3699780	I remember being a kid and squeezing myself in between couch cushions and getting really excited and thinking about Batgirl.
3701780	3704780	And then I saw Temple Grandin and she had the squeeze machine.
3704780	3705780	And I was wondering...
3705780	3707780	Was it a sexual thing or was it like...
3708780	3714780	I used to get rolled up like a sausage in a blanket and I couldn't move.
3714780	3716780	Do you think your sexuality is a moving target?
3716780	3720780	Or do you think that you're slowly honing in on a fixed target that's always been there?
3720780	3723780	Do you think it changes as you grow?
3723780	3726780	Or do you think it's something that's always been there?
3726780	3728780	That you're just now getting better at finding?
3728780	3730780	I don't think I'm good at finding it.
3730780	3734780	I have fetishes and I think that are almost, as the name would suggest,
3734780	3737780	they're almost removed from proper sexuality.
3737780	3743780	I think that I fetishize things and then it's like...
3743780	3745780	It removes me from sex.
3745780	3755780	Like my fetish for women's legs clad in a material that essentially removes the chaos from them.
3755780	3757780	It turns them more into cartoons.
3757780	3759780	You know, it's all about removal.
3759780	3762780	And like fully clothed women just hanging out.
3762780	3764780	And like I'm just sitting there going...
3766780	3768780	And I gratify myself and then I'm done.
3768780	3771780	You know, I did my little penis sneeze and I go...
3771780	3773780	Penis sneeze? No.
3773780	3776780	It's not romantic, but it's not sexual either.
3776780	3777780	Stop having penis sneeze.
3777780	3781780	And then when you fall in love with a woman, you know, and then you welcome her into your life.
3781780	3786780	And then during the courtship phase, there's none of that going on.
3786780	3791780	Because you love this person and your sex life is involved with theirs
3791780	3793780	and the courting of them and stuff.
3793780	3797780	And then I go back to work and then all of a sudden I'm like golem again.
3797780	3805780	Like regarding this, you know, I'm just using like this fetish object to like get through the day era.
3805780	3810780	And so to answer your question, I haven't been honing in on anything.
3810780	3817780	I think there's always been like this sort of childish asexual impulse that's like unhealthy.
3817780	3819780	It's like an outcropping of sexuality.
3819780	3822780	Could you just masturbate on your lunch break?
3822780	3823780	That would...
3823780	3824780	I often do, my friend.
3824780	3826780	There you go.
3826780	3828780	I mean, I've done it in some strange places.
3828780	3831780	I do want to go back to this because you could see my little OCD working.
3831780	3834780	I just want to have closure on this one thing talking about the show.
3834780	3837780	I don't want to think too weird.
3837780	3838780	Okay, too weird.
3838780	3842780	That's the jock guy in me, but weird is okay.
3842780	3846780	The gay stuff where it goes, I can't be involved in baseball.
3846780	3848780	It's a very jock world.
3848780	3849780	It's conservative.
3849780	3851780	I've done a lot of stuff for baseball.
3851780	3852780	It's in my heart.
3852780	3855780	I would hate to be there and go, oh, there's the guy who goes to Bangkok.
3855780	3856780	We can't have...
3856780	3857780	I don't know.
3857780	3858780	I have some like nightmare.
3858780	3859780	Not a nightmare.
3859780	3860780	It's just a weird thought.
3860780	3865780	And the other thing is just like unfunny and not reflective of me.
3865780	3866780	Those are my fears.
3866780	3868780	Everything else, I let go.
3868780	3869780	Like I'll go on...
3869780	3875780	I'll be on a Nick Kroll show or I'll do Chelsea Lately or I'll do, you know, Ska...
3875780	3876780	It's like go ahead and do it.
3876780	3883780	But because my show is so, it's so personal and we talk about lady boy stuff.
3883780	3887780	We talk about 10% gay stuff and it's kind of not in my hands.
3887780	3893780	When I do it here or I do it on stage or at the comedy store or on a podcast, it's kind of funny.
3893780	3897780	And I know I've gotten traction on it based on Twitter emails.
3897780	3904780	But when you hand it over to somebody else to do it and then you see what they do, it's like not your vision.
3905780	3912780	And then you have to kind of give notes based on their vision and then it's like a C+.
3912780	3913780	You know what I mean?
3913780	3914780	That's how I feel.
3914780	3919780	Now I could be, you know, being too hard on myself again, thinking worst case scenario.
3919780	3920780	But that's where I am.
3920780	3921780	And that's why I'm carrying the stress.
3921780	3929780	I would probably guess that like what's funny about you, what's like enjoyable, marketable, successful about you
3929780	3932780	is the fact that we want to watch you go through that struggle.
3932780	3941780	We want to watch a guy that throws like a wicked slider or a fucking curve ball and a fast ball and a breaking ball
3941780	3945780	and all this stuff and also goes to Bangkok and might have an encounter with a lady boy.
3945780	3949780	And also we don't want you to be like totally okay with that.
3949780	3950780	We want to watch...
3950780	3956780	You have to come home to your kitchenette and say, okay, look, here's what happened in Thailand, all right?
3956780	3958780	Now don't interrupt me.
3958780	3963780	Some stuff went down and I don't want you to judge me before I finish, okay?
3963780	3964780	Here's what happened.
3964780	3966780	Yeah, it's almost like that.
3966780	3967780	Like a rebuttal.
3967780	3968780	That's what I would say.
3968780	3971780	Like just like a walking Brody or whatever they do after the shows.
3971780	3972780	I don't know.
3972780	3974780	Like just give me 30 minutes.
3974780	3975780	It'll be closure.
3975780	3977780	It's a little OCD.
3977780	3981780	The protagonist that you are is the struggle.
3981780	3987780	Like not to be like a pedant, but like brothers Karamazov.
3987780	3988780	There's two brothers.
3988780	3989780	One's really idealistic.
3989780	3991780	One's really realistic.
3991780	3992780	The middle brother...
3992780	3993780	Fuck.
3993780	3994780	Dimitri?
3994780	3996780	He is torn between those two things.
3996780	3999780	It's the struggle between here's what I think I am.
3999780	4000780	Here's what I wish I were.
4000780	4002780	Here's what I know I am.
4002780	4003780	Here's how I'm perceived.
4003780	4004780	Here's how I don't want to be perceived.
4004780	4010780	We want to watch you fucking flip and flop like a fish out of water about being you,
4010780	4011780	being...
4011780	4012780	What are you like?
4012780	4013780	Six, four?
4013780	4014780	How tall are you?
4014780	4015780	Six, two, 211 pounds.
4015780	4017780	I take psyllium husk every day.
4017780	4018780	Okay.
4018780	4019780	Exactly.
4019780	4020780	Exactly.
4020780	4025780	There's that part of you that is so macho and the other part like keep struggling for
4025780	4026780	our benefit.
4026780	4027780	Keep...
4027780	4028780	I'm okay with that.
4028780	4029780	It's talks like this, Jeff.
4029780	4030780	It's like when I get that reassurance.
4030780	4031780	Like Brody, it's okay.
4031780	4032780	It's all right.
4032780	4035780	Because sometimes production wise, I don't want to complain.
4036780	4040780	I just need a little bit of hand holding sometimes, especially with the subject matter.
4040780	4043780	You're dealing with the guy who is a little on the edge.
4043780	4044780	So I went out on this tour.
4044780	4046780	I was on this comedy tour.
4046780	4051780	And it's like sometimes I just felt like it's hard to communicate on your own personal project
4051780	4054780	via Vimeo and email.
4055780	4059780	I mean, at least I felt like let's verbalize something.
4059780	4060780	So it's tough.
4060780	4061780	It's a struggle.
4061780	4062780	I know that's how shows are done.
4062780	4064780	Hopefully I'll get another chance.
4064780	4065780	I just don't want to have a heart attack.
4065780	4067780	I don't want to have a heart attack.
4067780	4070780	And I don't want my, you know, Molotov cocktails to my...
4070780	4073780	The one thing that we don't want out of you.
4073780	4076780	We don't ever want you, Brody Stevens, or anybody here in Harmon Town.
4076780	4081780	The one thing that we all agree on is we don't want anyone to have to change themselves
4081780	4082780	for anybody else.
4082780	4087780	But we also want everybody to like become the best version of themselves.
4087780	4090780	Just keep being conflicted.
4090780	4092780	Like that's really beautiful.
4092780	4093780	Really?
4093780	4094780	Yeah.
4094780	4095780	That's how you grow, right?
4095780	4096780	Yeah.
4096780	4097780	All right.
4097780	4098780	Good.
4098780	4099780	I'll take that, Jeff.
4099780	4103780	Keep your fists in the air and keep being soft and hard at the same time.
4103780	4106780	You're a coin spinning on its edge.
4106780	4107780	It's great.
4107780	4108780	I like it.
4108780	4109780	I can take that.
4109780	4110780	It's a good metaphor.
4110780	4111780	I'll keep doing it.
4111780	4112780	I'm learning to deal with it.
4112780	4113780	Exercise, meditation, podcasting.
4113780	4115780	I'm going to get through that.
4115780	4116780	Brody Stevens, everybody.
4116780	4122780	Listen to the Festival of Friends on payroll, friendship.
4122780	4123780	You got it.
4123780	4124780	Brody Stevens, Festival of Friends.
4124780	4125780	Thanks, Dan.
4125780	4126780	Thanks, Jeff.
4126780	4127780	Yeah.
4127780	4133780	That felt good.
4133780	4138780	You dismissed Brody right at 9-11.
4138780	4142780	One tragedy after another.
4142780	4145780	There's no such thing as accidents, man.
4145780	4151780	Well, it's the second worst thing that ever happened in this country.
4151780	4153780	Brody leaving the stage at 9-11.
4153780	4154780	Wait.
4154780	4155780	Should we have kept him up?
4155780	4156780	Should he just stay here?
4156780	4157780	Should we keep him out here?
4157780	4158780	No.
4158780	4159780	No.
4159780	4160780	I wanted to because I offered him in the green room.
4160780	4163380	It was like, well, your options are you can come up later and then you can play D&D with
4163380	4165060	us because Aaron's not here tonight.
4165060	4170100	But no, he wanted to actually I think I brought him up too late and kept him here too long.
4170100	4172780	But let's get Kumail out here because he has-
4172780	4173780	Yeah.
4173780	4174780	Jesus.
4174780	4175780	Hello, stranger.
4176780	4177780	Yeah.
4177780	4178780	Kumail Nanjiani.
4178780	4179780	It's been a while.
4179780	4182780	Then it feels like it's been a long time.
4182780	4183780	I miss you so much.
4183780	4185780	I miss coming here a lot.
4185780	4187780	I really get bummed out every Sunday.
4187780	4189780	But you're on stage every goddamn night of the week.
4189780	4192780	Every time I open up the Instagrams or the Facebooks, you're doing something.
4192780	4193780	No.
4193780	4195780	Actually, I haven't been performing on stage that much.
4195780	4196780	I really haven't.
4196780	4197780	I really haven't.
4197780	4200780	Last night I was in New York and I performed there, but I really haven't been.
4200780	4201780	I haven't really been doing anything.
4201780	4203780	So you have other friends you like better than us in New York?
4203780	4204780	Is that what's going on?
4204780	4205780	Oh, no, I just had a show.
4205780	4207780	No, I started shooting the HBO show.
4207780	4210780	So I've had like 6 a.m. calls and stuff on Monday.
4210780	4212780	So I go to bed at 8 p.m.
4212780	4214780	I'm like, my schedule's all fucked.
4214780	4215780	All right.
4215780	4216780	You've been working like a dog.
4216780	4217780	Yeah.
4217780	4218780	Yeah.
4218780	4219780	Yeah.
4219780	4220780	Yeah.
4220780	4221780	Yeah.
4221780	4222780	Yeah.
4222780	4223780	Yeah.
4223780	4224780	Yeah.
4224780	4225780	Yeah.
4225780	4226780	Yeah.
4226780	4227780	You've been working like a dog.
4227780	4228780	Yeah.
4228780	4230780	You're all over the televisions.
4230780	4231780	Trying to be.
4231780	4232780	Yeah.
4232780	4233780	I love it.
4233780	4236780	I think the world needs a little more Kumail Nanjiani.
4236780	4238780	Oh, thank you.
4238780	4240780	Thank you.
4240780	4243780	What percent am I gay?
4243780	4245780	I'm 10 percent gay for you.
4245780	4247780	I'll tell you that.
4247780	4250780	I'm 100 percent gay for you.
4250780	4253780	That makes you a regular person.
4254780	4255780	All right.
4255780	4256780	Wait.
4256780	4265780	Before we focus on Kumail, I want to get Kumail's just response to this.
4265780	4266780	I got this email.
4266780	4268780	Not because it involves you, but I just.
4268780	4269780	Oh, sure.
4269780	4270780	Yeah.
4270780	4271780	I wanted you to be here for this.
4271780	4272780	Great.
4272780	4275780	And Jeff and Harmontown.
4275780	4280780	This is, you know, I'm 40 years old and I came out to Los Angeles
4280780	4283780	and I wanted to maybe write some TV and some movies and things.
4283780	4284780	Yeah.
4284780	4286780	Maybe meet a nice girl, maybe get married, move into a big house,
4286780	4288780	have a little Golden Doodle.
4288780	4291780	I'm achieving a lot of my dreams, step by step.
4291780	4293780	But there is one dream I didn't even know.
4293780	4294780	Okay.
4294780	4295780	I know what this is about.
4295780	4296780	I really had.
4296780	4298780	Until this email came in.
4298780	4301780	God, I can't.
4301780	4302780	I just.
4302780	4309780	This is from Carl Nolay Jr., 11th generation distiller from the Nolay Distillery.
4310780	4312780	On behalf of Kettle One.

4321780	4325780	We would like to invite you to become part of the Kettle One Alliance.
4325780	4327780	What the fuck?

4365780	4367780	There is to be had.
4367780	4368780	By the way.
4368780	4371780	An all expense paid funeral.
4373780	4374780	You know what's crazy?
4374780	4375780	You say the guy's name.
4375780	4377780	His signature is on this fucking bottle.
4377780	4378780	It's on the bottle N-word.
4378780	4379780	All right.
4379780	4380780	Nolay.
4380780	4381780	Right here.
4381780	4386780	Kettle One prides itself on being an ultra premium vodka
4386780	4393780	that aligns with authentic influential leaders like yourself.
4394780	4401780	We hope you enjoy the handcrafted bottle of Kettle One enclosed
4401780	4404780	and look forward to welcoming you as part of the family.
4404780	4410780	We are excited about the opportunity for you to represent the Kettle One Alliance.
4411780	4414780	Alliance!
4415780	4417780	Alliance!
4418780	4421780	It's in the way that you use it.
4422780	4424780	You're like in the Avengers of booze.
4424780	4425780	Yeah.
4425780	4426780	Yeah.
4426780	4427780	That's Sam Jackson like yelling at me.
4427780	4428780	Exactly.
4428780	4431780	Oh, you think you drink Kettle One motherfucker?
4431780	4432780	Yeah.
4432780	4433780	Exactly.
4433780	4434780	Get ready to drink more.
4434780	4436780	For the planet.
4437780	4440780	That segment brought to you by Fernet Branca.
4441780	4442780	Fernet Branca.
4443780	4445780	The king of Italian Amari.
4446780	4447780	All right.
4447780	4448780	So anyways, another thing.
4448780	4450780	It's not surprising that it happened.
4450780	4452780	It's surprising that it took this long.
4453780	4456780	I think you should have gotten this email years ago.
4457780	4459780	I think they go by liquid volume.
4459780	4461780	I think they're like, Holy shit.
4461780	4463780	This guy has put us on the map.
4463780	4464780	Did I tell you?
4464780	4467780	But not because he created community because he's had so much to drink.
4468780	4472780	My manager had a client whose name escaped me for a moment.
4472780	4476780	She played a character on Chicago hook called Lisa Katera.
4476780	4483780	And my manager called up Cadillac and they have a car called the Cadillac Katera.
4483780	4487780	And she said, my client plays Lisa Katera.
4487780	4488780	Lisa Katera.
4488780	4491780	Oh, so it's like subliminal marketing.
4491780	4496780	Well, actually, I think the guy that wrote the show might have picked that name because of that.
4496780	4497780	Yeah.
4497780	4498780	Oh, Jesus.
4498780	4500780	They also had a character called Biocorvette.
4502780	4504780	So she called up a Cadillac.
4504780	4505780	Can you just give her a car?
4505780	4507780	Like, well, will she drive it in the show?
4507780	4511780	I can't guarantee that, but she'll talk about it on Leno and Conan and shit.
4511780	4512780	And so she did.
4512780	4513780	And they gave her a goddamn car.
4513780	4515780	I was in a show.
4515780	4518780	Can I change my character's name to Porsche 911?
4518780	4519780	Yeah.
4519780	4522780	911 is not a great association.
4522780	4524780	This was in 2000.
4524780	4525780	It was before.
4525780	4527780	This was before?
4527780	4528780	Yes.
4528780	4530780	My fascination with 911 predates all of the tragedy.
4530780	4537780	Not to take away from that story, but just to express how exciting this is for me.
4537780	4539780	It's fucking big news, man.
4539780	4541780	That's a story about...
4541780	4544780	That's another story about, like, oh, we finagled the thing.
4544780	4549780	We got free PlayStations because it's a Sony show, and I told him Abed was going to play a PlayStation.
4549780	4551780	This is you becoming the Highlander.
4551780	4552780	This is...
4552780	4554780	They called me authentic.
4556780	4558780	They came to me.
4558780	4561780	They called me an inspiration.
4561780	4565780	Do you think that was a forum email, or that was a handcrafted email?
4565780	4566780	I think that he sat...
4566780	4567780	He was like, well, I've...
4567780	4569780	Wait, what's his name?
4569780	4570780	Carl Nolay.
4570780	4571780	Yeah.
4571780	4572780	Carl Nolay.
4572780	4575780	You think he sat down and said pen to paper, and he goes,
4575780	4577780	Dear Mr. Dan Harmon.
4577780	4579780	I'm a big fan of Harmon Town.
4579780	4583780	He's the 11th generation of the family that's been distilling this vodka.
4583780	4587780	So you know his great-great-grandpa was writing to, like, Thomas Edison.
4589780	4590780	We don't know that.
4590780	4591780	We don't know that.
4591780	4593780	You invented the cool shit.
4593780	4594780	Something like that.
4594780	4595780	Yeah.
4595780	4596780	You're the Thomas Edison of our day.
4596780	4599780	So what's going to happen now?
4599780	4601780	Do we know what the outcome of this will be?
4601780	4603780	He's going to be drinking more Kettle One.
4603780	4604780	No, he won't.
4604780	4606780	He'll be paying less.
4606780	4607780	Yeah.
4607780	4613780	I mean, that's the cool thing, is that now that this has happened,
4613780	4616780	the rest of life is improv.
4617780	4619780	I become a constellation.
4619780	4621780	That's what happens.
4621780	4627780	I join Ursa Major and Archimedes.
4627780	4628780	Yeah.
4628780	4631780	You see that thing that looks like a Kettle One bottle?
4631780	4633780	That's Dan Harmon.
4633780	4634780	Yeah.
4634780	4637780	He drank himself into the cosmos.
4637780	4640780	Is that what you've been trying to do?
4640780	4641780	Yeah.
4642780	4646780	Like, oh, boy, that makes me happy.
4646780	4648780	That is amazing.
4648780	4653780	That's like if Popeye got a letter of recommendation from spinach.
4655780	4657780	We just want to let you know, Popeye.
4657780	4660780	He'd be like, eh, it's about time, you know?
4662780	4666780	Wait, so you're like the Popeye of vodka is what you're saying?
4666780	4668780	It's where I get my strength.
4668780	4669780	Okay.
4669780	4672780	My family has a relationship with...
4672780	4673780	What is the...
4673780	4677780	I'm imagining, because I've been to the writer's room at Community up in Paramount,
4677780	4682780	and there's always giant Costco-sized bottles of Kettle One there.
4683780	4686780	Courtesy of my assistant, Spencer.
4686780	4687780	Oh, well, fuck it.
4687780	4688780	Let's bring him out on that.
4688780	4690780	Spencer, everybody, come on out.
4694780	4695780	See you, man.
4698780	4699780	Spencer.
4700780	4701780	Yeah.
4701780	4702780	What's up?
4703780	4709780	I saw that email before you did, Dan, about your club ownership or whatever.
4709780	4711780	Alliance membership.
4711780	4712780	Yeah, yeah.
4714780	4715780	Yeah.
4715780	4718780	You don't seem stoked.
4718780	4720780	I mean, I'm not getting any free vodka.
4720780	4721780	Yeah, you are.
4721780	4722780	You're getting free vodka.
4722780	4727780	It's kind of into my job, like making sure he has steady access to vodka is a huge responsibility
4727780	4728780	of mine.
4728780	4732780	Oh, so you're saying you might be getting made redundant because...
4732780	4735780	And I mean, he has a concierge service, like...
4735780	4736780	Oh, don't worry about that.
4736780	4737780	That's the same thing.
4737780	4739780	Did you get concierge service?
4739780	4740780	Yes.
4740780	4741780	Well, it says concierge service.
4741780	4742780	What does that really mean?
4742780	4743780	They'll bring you the vodka.
4743780	4745780	That's what that means.
4745780	4749780	You can call him at midnight and be like, I need some fucking vodka.
4749780	4752780	And at 12.05, your doorbell will be there.
4752780	4754780	You really think that's what it means?
4754780	4755780	Well, yes.
4756780	4760780	Drew Carey had like Budweiser, like that kind of hookup where he said...
4760780	4761780	Budweiser?
4762780	4764780	He's Drew Carey.
4765780	4767780	I guess he is the Budweiser of comedians.
4767780	4768780	At any point...
4768780	4769780	That is not an insult.
4769780	4771780	I love Drew Carey.
4771780	4773780	I think he's fucking hilarious.
4773780	4774780	He's the king of beers.
4774780	4777780	I said that because the joke was there, but I think he's hilarious.
4777780	4783780	He's great, but if at any point Drew Carey picks up a certain, like calls a number,
4783780	4787780	a truck pulls up at his house with kegs or cases or whatever he wants,
4787780	4791780	like the Budweiser is on the house, like forever.
4791780	4792780	Yeah.
4792780	4793780	Well, that's you.
4793780	4794780	What cattle won?
4794780	4797780	I want that with Vivian Westwood suits.
4797780	4802780	I want a fucking giant black truck to pull up, like Knight Rider,
4802780	4808780	and there'd just be a giant rack of suits, all size 54, UK size,
4808780	4812780	and I want them to just push it all into my place.
4813780	4814780	Huh.
4814780	4815780	I don't know what mine would be.
4815780	4816780	I guess video games.
4816780	4817780	I would take some video games.
4817780	4818780	Oh, man.
4818780	4819780	Yeah.
4819780	4820780	Definitely.
4827780	4828780	I want to read the Xbox Alliance.
4828780	4830780	All right.
4830780	4836780	Camille, not to be provocative, and not to like probe in a weird way.
4836780	4838780	How do you feel about heel popping?
4838780	4840780	About what?
4841780	4842780	Heel popping.
4842780	4844780	Oh, I've never been.
4844780	4847780	I feel like, okay, so people talk about fetishes and stuff.
4847780	4850780	I don't have any, but just because I'm still just happy to be there,
4850780	4857780	you know, like I'm just like so grateful genuinely just to sort of be involved
4857780	4859780	in the process of sex.
4859780	4863780	But that's once you're in a room with a naked lady.
4863780	4864780	That's how we all feel.
4864780	4867780	But is there anything that turns your head and like makes your brain spark?
4867780	4871780	I've been married for six years, and I am still,
4871780	4874780	will take any part of her that she let me have.
4874780	4875780	Oh.
4875780	4876780	Seriously.
4876780	4880780	I mean, it sounds withholding, but still sexy and wonderful.
4880780	4881780	Number one is the butt.
4881780	4882780	I'm joking.
4884780	4887780	Her most precious prize, that's what I call it.
4890780	4892780	That was an anal sex joke about my wife.
4892780	4893780	Yeah.
4894780	4896780	Really horrible.
4896780	4903780	For me, for me, like when I watch porn, and I do, of course, as we all must,
4903780	4906780	somebody's giving it a look.
4906780	4908780	You see what?
4908780	4909780	Somebody's watching it.
4909780	4910780	Yeah.
4910780	4911780	Yeah.
4911780	4912780	There's certainly an industry.
4912780	4914780	I have a couple notes for the porn people.
4914780	4918780	Learn how to fucking hold a camera and then get the girl in the frame.
4918780	4920780	Get the girl in the frame.
4920780	4922780	You had one job.
4922780	4925780	Why is there six feet of headroom, and I can't see her legs?
4925780	4926780	Yeah.
4926780	4927780	Like get the gal in the shot.
4927780	4928780	Focus.
4928780	4933780	Here's my other, I don't like it when the girl looks into the camera,
4933780	4936780	because that, I don't know why they keep doing that.
4936780	4938780	I know I'm not there, I'm not an idiot.
4938780	4941780	Because they're not theatrically trained.
4941780	4942780	No.
4942780	4944780	But they'll like talk to the camera.
4944780	4945780	Yeah.
4945780	4947780	And I'm like not at my best right now.
4947780	4951780	Like, I don't want to see, I don't want you to see me like this.
4951780	4952780	I'm horrible right now.
4952780	4956780	And also, to the extent that I'm immersed at all, I'm pretending to be the guy.
4956780	4957780	Yeah.
4957780	4958780	So then you're looking.
4958780	4962780	And the weirdest thing is when they do what they're doing to the fella,
4962780	4965780	and then they're looking at the camera and going, do you like that?
4965780	4966780	Do you like the way I do that?
4966780	4967780	And I'm like, well, what?
4967780	4969780	Now, how am I involved?
4969780	4970780	I'm not involved.
4970780	4971780	I know.
4971780	4972780	Who's that?
4972780	4974780	What do you mean, do I like that?
4974780	4976780	Well, ask him.
4976780	4977780	Jesus Christ.
4977780	4978780	But I don't.
4978780	4980780	If I didn't like it, I wouldn't be watching it.
4980780	4984780	I don't want them to ask him because when the guys talk, it's over.
4984780	4985780	It's fucking over.
4985780	4989780	And also, will the guys stop putting their fingers in the girl's mouth?
4989780	4993780	Can you please stop fish-hooking and doing that douchey shit?
4993780	4996780	Well, there's a lot of weird violence.
4996780	4999780	I feel like there's a lot of incredible rampant misogyny and porn.
4999780	5001780	It's like, you don't like fucking her.
5001780	5004780	Therefore, she doesn't like being fucked by you, and now nobody wins.
5004780	5008780	The biggest turn-on for me in porn is when the gal at least appears,
5008780	5011780	hopefully realistically is enjoying it.
5011780	5017780	That's why I like, this is weird, but I go, if there's like a squirting one,
5017780	5020780	I go for that because then I'm like, oh, for sure she's into it.
5020780	5021780	Oh, yeah.
5023780	5027780	Squirting's great, but it's always that fucking cytheria chick is fucking weird.
5029780	5030780	She's good at it.
5030780	5032780	I don't like when it gets on the camera.
5032780	5033780	She's weird.
5033780	5034780	She's weird.
5034780	5036780	You don't like it when a droplet hits the lens because it's like,
5036780	5037780	it takes you out of it.
5037780	5040780	Yeah, because it's not like, you know, like in video games now,
5040780	5043780	when it rains, it gets on the screen, and then I think of that,
5043780	5048780	and then I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't like that.
5048780	5050780	It's not the act of squirting.
5050780	5052780	It's just the idea of she wants to be there.
5052780	5055780	What's amazing about squirting is it's physical,
5055780	5058780	empirical evidence that the girl enjoyed herself.
5058780	5059780	That's what I like.
5059780	5060780	It's proof.
5060780	5061780	You know what I also don't like?
5061780	5064780	Often supported by an on-site special effects crew.
5065780	5068780	I mean, there's an online, like, there is a lot where I'm like,
5068780	5073780	that was, you should be hydrating because there's a lot of,
5073780	5074780	you think so?
5074780	5075780	Yes.
5075780	5076780	This trickery?
5077780	5079780	Yeah, it's, it's sort of a stunt.
5079780	5082780	Am I, am I being lied to by the porn industry?
5082780	5083780	Yeah.
5084780	5085780	But isn't it interesting?
5085780	5088780	We talked about the dichotomy between gay and straight.
5088780	5091780	The other interesting thing is the dichotomy between which,
5091780	5096780	which, which it's, it's actually remarkable how this threshold has been
5096780	5100780	able to maintain itself in a society which clearly holds nothing sacred
5100780	5105780	anymore and which there's network shows called who wants to marry a dwarf or,
5105780	5109780	you know, who wants to eat spider shit for a, for a, for a,
5109780	5111780	for a chance at a Verizon job.
5112780	5115780	We are in the darkest days possible.
5115780	5120780	We are, what is on our TV is what was on the TV in the background of time.
5120780	5123780	Bandits like we, we are, we have,
5123780	5127780	we have gone beyond the pale of Patty Chayefsky's vision and network all the
5127780	5130780	way into just like people hanging upside down over lava and going,
5130780	5131780	are you afraid to die?
5131780	5132780	You dumb bitch.
5132780	5133780	Okay.
5133780	5134780	$5,000.
5136780	5139780	But, but we maintain this sexual obsession.
5139780	5140780	I read for that.
5140780	5144780	There's a dichotomy between what we call pornography and what we call reality.
5144780	5148780	When the truth is like, like pornography, when you really use that word
5148780	5152780	correctly, everything in our society has become pornography.
5152780	5154780	It's all for the prairie and interest.
5154780	5156780	It's all just garbage.
5156780	5159780	None of it is for the furtherment of the fucking species.
5159780	5163780	So, and yet we are so it's, it's, it's interesting and I'm going,
5163780	5164780	I'm not going to be cynical about it.
5164780	5171780	I'm going to, I'm going to say this is adorable about us that we are so obsessed
5171780	5175780	with sex, so in love with it and consider it so powerful that we have,
5175780	5179780	we still have been able to maintain this schism so that the people that are
5179780	5183780	willing to have sex on camera are, you know, the guy,
5183780	5186780	I'll just talk about the guys because I don't want to, you know,
5186780	5189780	we've had Dana, our friend Dana DeArma on here and like,
5189780	5192780	like I'm not going to, uh, I, I,
5192780	5196780	I don't want to add to the fucking landfill of misogyny that must be rampant
5196780	5198780	in the, when you go into pornography.
5198780	5199780	So let's just talk about the guys.
5199780	5202780	There's no chance of being politically incorrect about that.
5202780	5206780	The dumbest fucking people in the world are the only people that are willing to
5206780	5207780	do it.
5207780	5211780	Like the guy, like the, when they improvise their dialogue and the things
5211780	5214780	that they say to the women when they're like, like, like, you're what,
5214780	5215780	she's, she's on the hook.
5215780	5217780	She's willing to have sex with you on camera.
5217780	5220780	You don't have to, you don't have to spike that football.
5220780	5221780	I know that.
5221780	5222780	What are you saying?
5222780	5223780	I just blush.
5223780	5227780	I'm like, you're, oh God, no, just tell her you love her.
5227780	5232780	I mean, it might not be true,
5232780	5237780	but either is the idea of like, like slapping the face with your dick and your,
5237780	5240780	yeah, it's just the weird urban inflection.
5240780	5244780	You grew up rich.
5244780	5247780	Can everybody, can everybody stop spitting on everything?
5247780	5251780	Like the fucking spitting is fucking good.
5251780	5254780	Can everything stop being like fucking crooked and pierced and covered with
5254780	5259780	butterflies and like, what about the poor little 40 year old guy with a little
5259780	5265780	dick just wants to watch a librarian say your books are overdue.
5265780	5269780	You owe me so much money and have the guy like Ron Jeremy or someone like troll
5269780	5275780	like guy that represents me go, but I don't have any money.
5275780	5282780	Well, you're going to have to do something because this book is overdue.
5282780	5283780	I don't know.
5283780	5284780	Whoa.
5284780	5285780	I can't.
5285780	5286780	What are you doing?
5286780	5287780	What are you doing?
5287780	5288780	Refusal of the call.
5288780	5289780	Yeah.
5289780	5290780	Powerful.
5290780	5291780	Powerful.
5291780	5296780	Makes, makes, makes a person hard as a diamond.
5296780	5301780	Thresholds, goddesses, atonements with fathers.
5301780	5306780	Don't take that literally, but.
5306780	5307780	But that is Debbie does Dallas.
5307780	5313780	There's a big atonement with the father in there called doing Debbie.
5313780	5318780	I think it's weird to think about how it's the only industry I can think of that could
5318780	5324780	end right now and we would be fine forever because there is so much porn out there.
5324780	5325780	Oh yeah.
5325780	5332780	The worst would be before you die, you have to watch one video for, for the second time.
5332780	5335780	Like you can watch porn every single day.
5335780	5339280	Like if we stop making salt, at some point we're going to be like, we need some fucking
5339280	5340280	salt.
5340280	5344780	But with porn, there's always so much porn.
5344780	5347780	We've been fucking great at it for so long.
5347780	5353780	But porn is something where like you, you have that one image, that one video that you
5353780	5355780	can go back to over and over again.
5355780	5358780	That's like, that one for some reason is potent.
5358780	5360540	Like the way they make eye contact or something.
5360540	5363980	I had this weird thing when I was a kid, I had a very, very religious Muslim upbringing.
5363980	5368820	So I found porn, but I would feel like immense amount of guilt, guilt for it.
5368820	5375020	So I would always watch it, but I had to be done before they achieved penetration.
5375020	5379220	Also the fact that I call it achieved.
5379220	5380220	And done.
5380220	5383660	So just how far away outside my reality it was.
5383660	5384660	Xbox Alliance.
5384660	5385660	Yeah.
5385660	5386660	Xbox Alliance.
5386660	5387660	It's been unlocked.
5387660	5393620	Yeah, but so I would watch it, but right before they actually started fucking, I had to like
5393620	5398060	come and be done before that because then I thought that it was, that then it wasn't
5398060	5399060	a sin.
5399060	5400060	Hmm.
5400060	5404140	I like, I like when the gals enjoy it and I want the guy to have a giant dick and not
5404140	5405140	talk.
5405140	5406140	Don't talk.
5406140	5410460	You don't like them to talk, even if it's not like terrible talk?
5410460	5416100	If they talk, it better be fucking interesting and fucking, it better be my life is this
5416100	5420980	here in yellow leaf, lay on McDuff.
5420980	5427260	We want them to talk about how we don't use words enough.
5427260	5431340	The girl says, hopefully you'll let me suck your dick and get to the guy, you just, his
5431340	5437460	voice above the camera goes like, actually hopefully used as an adverb as being a misappropriated
5437460	5438460	there.
5438460	5441900	If you're saying that you would like to suck my dick full of hope.
5441900	5442900	It's so ironic.
5442900	5443900	You're eating my pussy.
5443900	5444900	It's not ironic.
5444900	5445900	It's coincidental.
5445900	5449460	Two titties emerged in a yellow wood.
5449460	5451780	And I chose the one less nibbled on.
5451780	5457620	I've been obsessed with the number 9 11 for many years, I'll expand on it while you suck
5457620	5458620	my balls.
5458620	5462180	I used to have dreams of you rubbing my nuts like this and now it's happening.
5462180	5468300	Spencer, let's play some Dungeons and Dragons shall we?
5468300	5473060	Yeah, let's do that.
5473060	5477140	Or do you, or does Spencer want to talk about his debut as a network, uh, single actor?
5477140	5478620	Oh, fuck D&D.
5478620	5479620	Let's talk about that.
5479620	5480620	That's better.
5480620	5483900	Yeah, going from sex to the polar opposite of sex doesn't seem like a good transition.
5483900	5491740	No, no, no, I crave nothing more after sex than Dungeons and Dragons, but well, that's
5491740	5496260	funny because when I play Dungeons and Dragons, I crave nothing more than sex.
5496260	5504300	No, it's a game that I combine D&D with sex is I fuck every goddamn thing I meet.
5504300	5508540	But yeah, I mean, you, uh, we, we, I kind of dropped it on you like a sandbag.
5508540	5509540	Yeah.
5509540	5512900	And I did that because I didn't want you to have to worry about whether or not you were
5512900	5515340	supposed to say yes or no to it.
5515340	5519460	I just wanted you to have the luxury of having it thrust upon you.
5519460	5523740	Yeah, no, it was a really, a really good methodology there.
5523740	5524740	What did you do it?
5524740	5525740	When was it?
5525740	5526740	It was Monday and Wednesday.
5526740	5527740	Oh, wow.
5527740	5529420	My, my days.
5529420	5533500	And without, uh, he was in like a total of four scenes, right?
5533500	5534500	Yeah.
5534500	5535500	Yeah.
5535500	5536820	Like, is it like a legitimate, like guest star role?
5536820	5541100	Have you ever done any television, like any acting, learning lines, any theater in school
5541100	5542100	or anything?
5542100	5543100	No.
5543100	5546300	I mean, when I was in college, I took a speech class, but he didn't even have to like memorize.
5546300	5553380	So what was it like for you to get a script, have these lines like, what was your process?
5553380	5557380	Uh, I vomited a lot.
5557380	5558380	Did you really?
5558380	5563460	I mean, not like a lot, but you did a little goes a long way with vomit.
5563460	5564460	Yeah.
5564460	5567300	That's, that's, that's my rule when it comes to vomit.
5567300	5568300	Yeah.
5568300	5570140	You did vomit because you were nervous.
5570140	5571140	Yeah.
5571140	5575500	I, I mean, the Harman town, you know, diehard Harman town fans will know I feel like shit
5575500	5580700	a lot because a combination of weird anxiety and eating garbage a hundred percent of the
5580700	5582860	time, uh, makes me feel weird.
5582860	5586100	So like sometimes when I come to Harman town, I'm feeling weird and that's what it is.
5586100	5588180	It's just these two things.
5588180	5590100	So that's, that's what was happening.
5590100	5595740	It makes you understand why, uh, you know, famous people are all about, uh, health because
5595740	5598020	like you can't afford not to be healthy.
5598020	5601620	If you're vomiting, when you're supposed to be in front of the camera, like you're fucked,
5601620	5602620	right?
5602620	5603620	Yeah.
5603620	5604620	You can't be sick at all.
5604620	5605620	Yeah.
5605620	5606620	Um, I don't get why.
5606620	5607620	Did you have a good time?
5607620	5608620	How was it?
5608620	5612640	It was like, it was really nerve wracking because I mean, I don't even talk to people
5612640	5614140	that are near me.
5615140	5621260	But he was, yeah, he's doing scenes with, uh, like I'll make arbitrary decisions about
5621260	5626780	what's a spoiler and what's not, but he was, he, he was doing scenes with, uh, Danny Pooty,
5626780	5630940	Alison Brie and Brie Larson, like, and he was the fourth and was an equal part of all
5630940	5631940	of these scenes.
5631940	5632940	Oh, that's great.
5632940	5641180	And I can't express enough how much I'd like to finish a sentence without being applauded.
5641180	5642180	That's your purse.
5642180	5648540	And Midas touch and many, many, many like punch lines, like, like, like I, I just created
5648540	5653300	a character that was like, like, like I did my best to go like, okay, even it doesn't
5653300	5657860	matter if you are nervous or if you, you know, that it would just be like, cause you seem
5657860	5658860	unflappable.
5658860	5665300	Like a lot of people cannot handle, uh, if you, if you go like, oh, we like you, why
5665300	5669580	don't you stand up on this slightly higher platform because of what we like about you?
5669580	5673860	Most of us, like when we step onto that higher platform, we start to become so conscious
5673860	5681460	of, of, of the meta context that we actually, we kind of can't keep being the version of
5681460	5684100	ourself that the people valued down here.
5684100	5687380	But we brought you out of the audience and your dungeon master like drop, brought you
5687380	5688380	on tour.
5688380	5692780	You're in Brooklyn, 400 people are giving you a standing ovation for rolling dice and
5692780	5693780	stuff.
5693780	5696820	And, and it just like, so like you're, you're kind of unflappable.
5696820	5700660	Maybe you're puking in the bathroom, I guess we're learning, but, but, but, and I was like,
5700660	5701660	that's old though.
5701660	5707660	I mean, I did that at my old jobs and stuff too, but, uh, but I was very curious to see
5707660	5711460	your process because now you're beyond anything that I think I would be willing to do.
5711460	5716260	I don't think I would have been, I don't, they're on that, on the set of community there,
5716260	5723860	it's it's like, like, like just lights and a lot of them and like people hanging from
5723860	5725740	rafters and you're used to it.
5725740	5729660	Like literally in the rafters, like you'll hear someone talking like seven feet above
5729660	5730660	your head.
5730660	5731660	Holy shit.
5731660	5735900	And hundreds of people in the, in the space around you, everything is an illusion.
5735900	5739860	You see a TV as an apartment, but it is a crowd.
5739860	5747940	It is a town hall meeting surrounding you and three cameras on giant dollies and it's,
5747940	5753980	I don't know how, I don't know how, how, how, to what extent I'd be able to act naturally
5753980	5754980	in that environment.
5754980	5758460	And actors have to have a kind of psychosis because they have to know that the camera
5758460	5762420	is there and they have to act like they don't know it's there, but they also have to act
5762420	5765780	in a way that no one would act in real life because the camera needs them to act a certain
5765780	5766780	way.
5766780	5767780	They need to keep their chin up.
5767780	5772500	But Spencer is kind of a slam dunk for that because he, uh, like you're, you're, you,
5772500	5774260	we only know you on camera.
5774260	5778860	You're on stage and nobody asked you to be, uh, you're on camera in the documentary.
5778860	5783300	Nobody asked you to be like your, your, your persona is the Spencer that we know, which
5783300	5785780	is the guy that's like, why is everybody looking at me?
5785780	5786780	Yeah, maybe.
5786780	5791420	But you, you, whether you're inwardly or you know, you're shitting like a Canadian goose,
5791420	5796220	like we don't know, uh, like outwardly you're just being Spencer that we all know and love.
5796220	5797220	Yeah.
5797220	5798220	I mean, I don't know.
5798220	5801980	I think I can foresee you standing next to like Joaquin Phoenix, like presenting an award
5801980	5804500	at like, like in two years.
5804500	5805500	I can see that.
5805500	5806500	Yeah.
5806500	5810220	Not that that's an important goal, but I think it's, I think, I think it's interesting.
5810220	5815660	Spencer, real quick before we play D and D for a moment, uh, weird fetish.
5815660	5819860	Um, I like it when the clothes are off.
5819860	5823940	What a weirdo.
5823940	5830900	Can I say one thing about the, what percentage gay do you think Spencer is?
5830900	5831900	Huh?
5831900	5833420	What percentage gay do you think?
5833420	5835460	I'm a zero on the Kinsey scale.
5835460	5836620	I think am I getting there?
5836620	5837620	You're pretty straight.
5837620	5838620	You mean?
5838620	5839620	Yeah.
5839620	5843700	I will say this about myself is that one of my biggest regrets is going to be that
5843700	5848180	I'll probably die without ever having sucked a penis.
5848180	5854220	Not because I just feel like it's an experience that so many people have and I just want to
5854220	5859380	be able to relate to it and it's never going to happen.
5859380	5861500	I don't want to fuck a dude in the ass.
5861500	5864020	I don't want to get fucked by a dude in the ass.
5864020	5866020	I think most people would let a guy go down on them.
5866020	5867020	I think that's fine.
5867020	5873020	But, but like sucking a penis is such a specific thing and I'll never have it.
5873020	5877020	Camille, you can do anything you want.
5877020	5882580	You know what's crazy to me like I need to turn the lights down real quick in movies
5882580	5883580	and stuff.
5883580	5896820	When you get introduced to, uh, oh, oh, Camille, like in, in, in, oh, hey, not bad.
5896820	5897820	Nice time out, huh?
5897820	5898820	What were you saying?
5898820	5899820	I didn't mean to step on that bed.
5899820	5900820	I didn't know.
5900820	5901820	No, it wasn't even.
5901820	5902820	What were you saying?
5902820	5903820	Well, I just, it's interesting to me.
5903820	5915660	Like I look like a gay closeted gay culture in movies, like, like, in other words, archetypes
5915660	5922740	where you, where, where you, uh, in movies and TV, when, uh, uh, closeted gay men are
5922740	5923900	represented in media.
5923900	5931420	Like the idea that they, they pay money for the privilege of blowing another dude, which
5931420	5934740	is really profound and interesting because it's like, Oh my God, that's how repressed
5934740	5935740	we are.
5935740	5940580	That it got that men who are pigs and who don't care about anything with themselves
5940580	5948260	and like, like, like they could be so fenced in psychologically that they would give money
5948260	5949260	or something.
5949260	5953940	They don't give, like, like, like, like, like, can I give you $50, can I just give you pleasure?
5953940	5954940	Another guy.
5954940	5955940	That's really profound to me.
5955940	5959780	I think that's the one thing that is definitely like you eat.
5959780	5960820	That's definitely gay.
5960820	5963980	Like if you're having, if you're fucking a dude in the ass, you could be like, Oh, this
5963980	5964980	is a woman.
5964980	5967340	If someone's fucking you in the ass, it could be a woman with a strap on.
5967340	5972420	But if you're sucking a penis, you're definitely sucking a penis, you know, like there's no,
5972420	5977540	so I think if, if you're someone, that's a very tough stance to take.
5977540	5979820	The jobs are great.
5979820	5983780	I think it was a Drew Carey's joke because like, you know, you're gay when you're sucking
5983780	5990860	a guy's dick, but you're thinking about another guy's dick.
5990860	5991860	That's gay.
5991860	6000140	That's kind of a Budweiser-y joke because I prefer something more important than that.
6000140	6001140	More Alliancy.
6001140	6002140	Yeah.
6002140	6003140	I like that.
6003140	6005020	I like that it's an alliance.
6005020	6006020	Yeah.
6006100	6008100	You're like part of NATO now.
6008100	6009100	Yeah.
6009100	6010100	Who?
6010100	6011100	I mean, yeah.
6011100	6012100	I feel like I...
6012100	6013100	Can we get a list of the other people who are currently in the alliance?
6013100	6017300	You don't think they frown on me like humble bragging or bragging or whatever.
6017300	6018300	No.
6018300	6019300	They like it, right?
6019300	6020300	This is what they want.
6020300	6021300	Do you think it's tacky?
6021300	6022500	They're like, don't tell them about the alliance.
6022500	6026540	I would venture a guess and say that you'd be disappointed to find out who's also received
6026540	6027540	that email.
6027540	6028540	Seth Green.
6028540	6029540	Yeah.
6029540	6030540	Jeremy Piven.
6030540	6031540	Jeremy Piven.
6031540	6032540	Definitely.
6032540	6041780	Well, but this time, Jeremy Piven probably has a Humana tie, so I mean, you hang out
6041780	6042780	long enough.
6042780	6043780	I mean...
6043780	6044780	Yeah.
6044780	6045780	He's been around a while.
6045780	6046780	Hello, comedy lovers.
6046780	6049380	This episode of Harmon Town is brought to you by the good people at Fulton and Rourke.
6049380	6051380	Are you talking about Fulton and Rourke?
6051380	6053180	Are those the good people?
6053180	6054180	Those are the best people.
6054180	6055180	Those are the two people.
6055180	6057380	I mean, well, Fulton and Rourke, mostly good people.
6057380	6060020	There's two guys there that are a little creepy.
6060020	6061020	Fulton?
6062020	6063020	Well, I don't know.
6063020	6064020	So, they're him or Rourke.
6064020	6065940	In fact, it has to be both of them.
6065940	6068860	You said there's two guys at Fulton and Rourke that are creepy.
6068860	6071940	Certainly not Jessica, the Fulton and Rourke receptionist.
6071940	6073940	Jessica Rourke?
6073940	6074940	Yeah.
6074940	6078780	You mean the poster child for nepotism and the glass ceiling?
6078780	6081660	Look, let's not get sidetracked.
6081660	6084660	We're here to talk about men's fragrance, aren't we?
6084660	6087140	We're here to talk about men's fragrance and grooming.
6087140	6090140	It's a grooming company that specifies.
6090140	6096660	It's a grooming company that specializes in solid colognes, shave and shower products,
6096660	6101060	all designed to make getting ready easier and more enjoyable.
6101060	6104860	Their travel-friendly wax-based colognes go anywhere.
6104860	6107380	The armpits, the butthole, anywhere.
6107380	6109180	I think they mean anywhere on the earth.
6109180	6115420	They actually put one special device called an obesion that allows you to really get
6115420	6118420	in there.
6119180	6120700	Fulton wanted us to tell you that.
6120700	6123620	Rourke, bit of a homophobe.
6123620	6127740	Plus, there's nothing to break or spell, and of course, they all smell fantastic.
6127740	6131340	And let's face it, guys are not famous for smelling fantastic.
6131340	6136500	You can use all the help you can get and who to get it from better than old Fulton and
6136500	6141420	his good buddy Rourke.
6141420	6146060	I don't trust any Rourke that spells his name R-O-A-R-K.
6146060	6147060	Why not?
6147700	6148700	It seems like he's hiding something.
6148700	6151060	I'll tell you what he's not hiding.
6151060	6153940	Delicious fragrances that come in solid form.
6153940	6158540	Fulton and Rourke's bar soap is designed to exfoliate the skin with or without a washcloth.
6158540	6166140	GQ Magazine just named Fulton and Rourke's shave cream the very best on the market today.

6227060	6229220	Aren't you bald Fulton here?
6229220	6236060	When I partnered with Nathaniel Rourke in 1971, my goal was simple.
6236060	6240620	Provide the world's finest balms, oils, topical ointments, solid and wax-based colognes at
6240620	6243220	a premium price for no discount.
6243220	6249060	However, Rourke got to me and said, prices shouldn't be premium and there should be a
6249060	6250060	discount.
6250060	6252220	Here's one in your eye, liquid cologne.
6252220	6253220	Nathaniel.
6253220	6254220	Yes?
6254220	6255220	It's me, Archibald.
6255220	6256220	Archibald.
6257220	6261540	Ah, for far too long have we lived under the horrible tyranny of liquid-based colognes
6261540	6262700	and fragrances.
6262700	6266300	When we aren't on safari, replacing animals.
6266300	6268740	We used to be called FultonandWoke.
6268740	6273940	But we thought it was too on the nose.
6273940	6279540	Here's something you should put on your nose, some of our fragrances and grooming creams.
6279540	6282980	Put a solid wax cologne right in your sniffer.
6282980	6287220	Our travel-friendly wax-based colognes go anywhere, plus there's nothing to break or
6287220	6290980	spill and of course, they all smell fantastic.
6290980	6293900	Is that our arch-rival, Nebuchadnezzar?
6293900	6295900	It's me, Carl Ampersand.
6295900	6298980	Oh, Carl Ampersand?
6298980	6301980	The hater of quality grooming products for men?
6301980	6306660	No, he's the love of wax-based colognes that brings Fulton and Rourke together.
6306660	6307660	Oh, shh.
6307660	6308660	He's an ampersand.
6308660	6310660	I have mixed receptions.
6310660	6315460	So, I always wondered why we chose ampersand instead of the word and.
6315460	6317300	Rourke, Rourke forgets you, my friend.
6317300	6322540	I know, it's part of my existence, just as surely as FultonandWoke's bar soap is designed
6322540	6325940	to exfoliate the skin with or without a washcloth.
6325940	6331060	It exfoliates your skin like sand, Fulton, Rourke, and ampersand.
6331060	6334980	Look, time is short, let's play a little bit of D&D.
6334980	6338860	Yeah, come on, just give us a, give it to us.
6338860	6340860	Give us a sweet taste, Spencer Scheck.
6340860	6342860	I always do.
6342860	6347660	I don't get it.
6347660	6353740	Last time on Harmon Town, our heroes clashed with Admiral Darkstar at the top of his black
6353740	6355420	keep.
6355420	6361340	The admiral thought the heroes were playing into his hands, but Darkstar had a rude awakening
6361340	6366140	as he realized the shards were nowhere to be found.
6366140	6371980	After yet more disappointment, Krista Berg knocked Admiral Darkstar from his post onto
6371980	6377500	the ground, where he was then sat upon by Mulrane.
6377500	6382460	Sharpie cast reduced person on himself and, as a miniature man, tried to trick the Dark
6382460	6388780	Lord by conjuring a crude figment of what he hoped would be the demonic warlord's mother.
6388780	6393540	When it failed to beguile Darkstar, Sharpie broke out into rap.
6393540	6394540	What did it mean?
6395340	6398940	How did the rap play out in terms of combat time?
6398940	6400940	Was it actually canon?
6400940	6404940	We'll find out tonight.
6404940	6406940	And that's it.
6406940	6408940	That's all I got.
6410940	6412940	Dan, should we get Ian?
6412940	6414940	He's here tonight to play Mulrane?
6414940	6416940	Do you want Ian to play Mulrane?
6416940	6420940	Ian, get out of the john and come up and play Mulrane for us.
6420940	6422940	Ian, everybody.
6424540	6430940	So yeah, Ian played as Krista Berg last week.
6430940	6432940	Yeah, it was you last week.
6432940	6433940	How was it?
6433940	6434940	It was hard.
6434940	6435940	It was hard?
6435940	6436940	It was hard.
6436940	6437940	He kicked some ass.
6437940	6438940	He did kick some ass.
6438940	6439940	He got a lot of good weapons.
6439940	6440940	Really?
6440940	6442940	I've never looked.
6442940	6444940	He just keeps tying a rope to a dagger.
6444940	6446940	Did you know you have Ebola?
6446940	6448940	Ebola?
6448940	6450940	I don't know how that's a weapon.
6450940	6452940	I give it to other people.
6453340	6455340	You could weaponize it.
6455340	6457340	It's Ebola, a weapon.
6457340	6458340	You throw it.
6458340	6460340	Oh, it's like a ropey thing?
6460340	6462340	It has ropes on it.
6462340	6463340	I know you like ropes.
6463340	6465340	Yeah, I'm into ropes.
6465340	6467340	It's like a cat of nine tails kind of.
6467340	6475340	It's like two weights separated by a cord and you whip one around like a lasso and let it go and then it'll wrap around.
6475340	6477340	Around people's legs and stuff.
6477340	6478340	Like a kinekinek.
6478340	6479340	Like superheroes.
6479340	6481340	Like Batman has a thing like that.
6481740	6483740	He was the superhero I was thinking of.
6483740	6487740	Spencer, give us the physical layout where we're all standing and what we're doing right now.
6487740	6488740	You're in a room.
6488740	6497740	It's rather unadorned except there's a big pillar of black crystal and on the ground is Admiral Darkstar is being set upon by Moraine.
6497740	6501740	There's an illusion of a woman standing nearby.
6501740	6502740	I'm sorry, there's what?
6502740	6508340	An illusion of a woman standing nearby that Sharpie had conjured and was talking about buying dicks off.
6508340	6510340	I think she's an older lady, right?
6510340	6511340	Definitely older.
6511340	6512340	Someone's mom.
6512340	6513340	Yeah.
6513340	6514340	I have a wire saw.
6514340	6515340	Yeah.
6515340	6516340	This is great.
6516340	6517340	Yeah, man.
6517340	6518340	There's two pages?
6518340	6521340	I put a lot of thought into these things.
6523340	6525340	Alright, so what's going on with Darkstar?
6525340	6526340	He's being sat on.
6526340	6527340	Is he...
6527340	6529340	He's not digging it so much.
6529340	6532340	Can I take my wire saw to his head?
6532340	6534340	You can try.
6535340	6539340	Admiral Darkstar, we're about to take a wire saw to your head.
6539340	6544340	Do you have anything to say about that?
6544340	6545340	Yeah.
6545340	6546340	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6546340	6547340	That's good.
6547340	6549340	Hey, do you have anything to say about that?
6549340	6552340	He has nothing to say.
6552340	6553340	Alright.
6553340	6554340	You're just saying nothing?
6554340	6555340	Who knows?
6555340	6557340	He's definitely not saying anything.
6557340	6558340	Wait a minute.
6558340	6559340	Do it.
6559340	6560340	You're so...
6560340	6564340	Your trademark is your speaking voice, Admiral Darkstar.
6564340	6565340	Speak.
6565340	6566340	I think it's because I'm sitting on him.
6566340	6567340	Maybe I should move.
6567340	6570340	No, don't move.
6570340	6572340	It's because he's being sat on.
6572340	6573340	Okay.
6573340	6575340	That's why he's not talking.
6575340	6576340	I kiss him.
6576340	6579340	Well, you'd have to move more rain.
6579340	6580340	Well, no, I don't.
6580340	6582340	I can bend down and kiss his face.
6582340	6584340	His face is being sat on.
6584340	6585340	Oh, he's...
6585340	6586340	He's going on his face.
6586340	6587340	I'll take it.
6587340	6588340	Yeah.
6588340	6589340	Can I say that?
6589340	6591340	So how would I cut his head?
6591340	6595340	I guess sort of sideways, top of his head, cut it like that.
6595340	6598340	I mean, I'd start at the neck.
6598340	6600340	But isn't the neck being sat on?
6600340	6602340	Well, the face is being sat on.
6602340	6605340	I mean, presumably the neck has a bit of exposure.
6605340	6609340	Can I get into a flanking position and be ready to fuck him?
6609340	6610340	Yes.
6610340	6613340	Alright, I go to his neck and I start cutting his neck.
6613340	6615340	You start cutting his neck.
6615340	6616340	Let me see.
6616340	6617340	Oh, God.
6617340	6618340	My head.
6618340	6621340	And I start throwing it.
6621340	6623340	I'm not happy with it.
6623340	6625340	And I say, already am.
6625340	6626340	Right now?
6626340	6633340	You hear a pain like screaming, muffled, coming through like armor and anus.
6633340	6635340	This is awful.
6635340	6637340	What are we doing?
6637340	6638340	What are we doing?
6638340	6639340	We want to kill this guy, right?
6639340	6640340	Well, I don't know.
6640340	6641340	We've already beaten him.
6641340	6643340	We're cutting his head off surgically.
6643340	6645340	His limbs are flailing around.
6645340	6649340	It's a little Taliban, sure.
6649340	6651340	I stop.
6651340	6654340	I have my pants down around my ankles behind him.
6654340	6656340	And I look at Sharpie and go, wait, wait.
6656340	6658340	Is there a flag in the play?
6658340	6659340	What's going on?
6659340	6661340	Well, why do we not like this guy?
6661340	6663340	Because he does stuff like this?
6663340	6667340	I mean, like, what is the difference between him and us?
6667340	6669340	If this is how we beat him.
6669340	6672340	He has represented evil the entire time we've ever heard it say.
6672340	6676340	He just wanted some shards of power and had some UFOs and stuff.
6676340	6677340	OK.
6677340	6679340	I keep my pants down around my ankles and I back off.
6679340	6682340	And I give the floor to Sharpie.
6682340	6683340	Well, all right.
6683340	6686340	I stop and I go, I'm sorry, dude.
6686340	6689340	Mulrain, could you get off his face?
6689340	6690340	OK.
6690340	6691340	This is a bad idea.
6691340	6692340	I get off his face.
6692340	6696340	Who could have saw his head off?
6696340	6701340	Also, Spencer, real quick, could you physically describe Admiral Darkstar right now?
6701340	6704340	Yeah, he looks like he's just wearing black armor.
6704340	6706340	He can't see any part of him.
6706340	6707340	What size is he?
6707340	6708340	Is he a regular humanoid?
6708340	6712340	He's like six foot tall and he has a horned helmet on the black cape.
6712340	6714340	Everything's all black and matte.
6714340	6715340	All right.
6715340	6718340	So we all get off him and we give him some space because Sharpie wants to have a little
6718340	6721340	coffee clutch with him.
6721340	6727340	I go, look, we can kill you if we want.
6727340	6730340	We were cutting your neck off, head off.
6730340	6734340	We could have done it before you had freedom.
6734340	6738340	I mean, you say those things, I guess.
6738340	6739340	What is he doing?
6739340	6743340	He's just staring at you guys.
6743340	6745340	He pulls himself to his feet.
6745340	6746340	What?
6746340	6747340	No, he stays sitting down.
6747340	6748340	I kick him back down.
6748340	6752340	OK.
6752340	6753340	That happens.
6753340	6758340	This is not an invitation to be equals with us.
6758340	6759340	This is magnanimity.
6759340	6765340	This is, I mean, do you just want to die?
6765340	6766340	Yes or no?
6766340	6768340	No.
6768340	6769340	See, he doesn't want to die.
6769340	6771340	That's how he sounds?
6771340	6772340	Oh, yeah.
6772340	6773340	Yes.
6773340	6774340	Yes, the best.
6774340	6777340	He sounds like Axl Rose.
6777340	6782340	Let's just tie him up and take him with us on our next adventure.
6782340	6784340	Do you know where you are?
6784340	6785340	What?
6785340	6786340	I'm sorry, what?
6786340	6789340	You're in my keep now.
6789340	6792340	I make the rules.
6792340	6799340	You have to understand it doesn't look like that to us.
6799340	6801340	He doesn't respond.
6801340	6802340	We almost cut your head off.
6802340	6805340	We totally could have.
6805340	6807340	So are we cool now?
6807340	6814340	If you cut my head off, I'll be more strong than you can imagine.
6814340	6818340	That's a good thing we didn't cut his head off.
6818340	6819340	Yeah.
6819340	6825340	I mean, I love Gunther Droses, so I'm bad.
6825340	6826340	I don't know.
6826340	6830340	I've never just assassinated someone.
6830340	6833340	We've beaten him and we're just supposed to terminate his life.
6833340	6838340	I go up to him and I rifle through his pockets.
6838340	6840340	He stops you.
6840340	6841340	Stops you?
6841340	6842340	Yeah.
6842340	6845340	I rifle him and then try to wrestle him to the floor.
6845340	6846340	All right.
6846340	6847340	What's your grapple bonus?
6847340	6849340	A grapple bonus?
6849340	6851340	I hope it's like 14 or something.
6851340	6852340	That's a very good question.
6852340	6854340	What's my grapple bonus?
6854340	6856340	My grapple?
6856340	6859340	I'm going to call it critical fail, a critical fail when I see one.
6859340	6860340	Oh, fuck hell.
6860340	6861340	Yeah.
6861340	6866340	So you go to grab him and he does this weird judo move like some sort of crazy nerd.
6866340	6869340	And before you know it, you're on your back and he's like...
6869340	6871340	I had a plus five grapple bonus.
6871340	6873340	That's why I said you need like a 14 or something.
6873340	6874340	Jesus Christ.
6874340	6875340	Yeah.
6875340	6880340	So now he's over you and he's got your arm and like one of those poses when the guy has your arm
6880340	6883340	and it makes you not able to do stuff.
6883340	6884340	That's happening.
6884340	6885340	Okay.
6885340	6886340	Sure.
6886340	6888340	Like some kind of half Nelson or something?
6888340	6889340	Yeah.
6889340	6890340	Definitely some form of Nelson.
6890340	6897340	I do the WWF thing where I slap my shoulder in fake pain.
6897340	6899340	I scorching Ray in his face.
6899340	6900340	Okay.
6901340	6903340	Wait, so cutting his head off is not okay?
6903340	6906340	I had to wait like in the movies for him to try to kill us.
6906340	6908340	He hasn't tried at all to attack us?
6908340	6910340	He's just not very good at it.
6910340	6913340	He's tried a thousand ways to kill us over the years.
6913340	6915340	Dealing 20 damage.
6915340	6916340	Nice.
6916340	6923340	You're scorching, you know, missile and it hits him in the face and his armor begins to glow red with heat.
6923340	6925340	What are you...
6925340	6928340	His armor starts to glow red with heat.
6928340	6929340	Yeah.
6929340	6930340	Because he hit it with a scorching missile.
6930340	6931340	Okay.
6931340	6932340	So that'll happen.
6932340	6933340	All right.
6933340	6934340	Well, damage report.
6934340	6935340	That's what happened.
6935340	6936340	I said 20 damage.
6936340	6937340	Okay.
6937340	6938340	Yeah.
6938340	6939340	But is he dead?
6939340	6940340	No.
6940340	6941340	All right.
6941340	6942340	He's Admiral Darkstar.
6942340	6943340	All right.
6943340	6947340	I start stomping his face like Robert De Niro in any various movies.
6947340	6950340	He's not on the ground anymore.
6950340	6951340	He's got Quark grapple.
6951340	6954340	Can we ask him to take his helmet off?
6954340	6957340	You could definitely ask him.
6957340	6959340	Is it Mulrane's turn?
6959340	6961340	Whoever wants to ask a question.
6961340	6962340	Honestly, I don't want to ask him.
6962340	6965340	I say we just tie his ass up and then we take his helmet off.
6965340	6966340	He's up and about now.
6966340	6967340	He's got our friend hostage.
6967340	6968340	We'll just kill him.
6968340	6970340	I'm sorry I caused an extra epilogue to killing him.
6970340	6971340	We had him right.
6971340	6976340	I didn't feel comfortable sitting on a man's face and sawing his head off.
6976340	6978340	There's no dignity in that.
6978340	6981340	I felt uncomfortable doing it.
6981340	6984340	I go into the corner and start...
6984340	6985340	I take my shoe off.
6985340	6986340	You're being grappled.
6986340	6987340	I'm being grappled?
6987340	6988340	What am I here for?
6988340	6991340	Okay.
6991340	6994340	You go into the corner.
6994340	6995340	Okay.
6995340	7002340	While I'm being grappled with my right foot, I start dangling my shoe.
7002340	7004340	I dip it.
7004340	7006340	I dangle it.
7006340	7009340	A couple of heel pops.
7009340	7010340	Pop that heel baby.
7010340	7011340	Yeah, pop it by a heel pop.
7011340	7012340	Dan.
7012340	7013340	I guess.
7013340	7028340	Sorry, I thought I was going full character there.
7028340	7029340	What do we do, guys?
7029340	7030340	Kill him.
7030340	7031340	Kill him.
7031340	7032340	Kill him.
7032340	7033340	All right.
7033340	7040340	I take out the wire saw and I go and I start sawing his neck off again.
7040340	7047340	I go and very loudly I say, this feels familiar.
7047340	7054340	So you start wire sawing his head and he's not doing the same thing as he did last time.
7054340	7059340	In fact, you start, you get a few strokes in and his helmet pops off and you see there's
7059340	7060340	no head inside.
7060340	7063340	It's all crazy, you guys.
7063340	7064340	There's no head?
7064340	7065340	Is there a helmet?
7065340	7066340	What?
7066340	7067340	What is there?
7067340	7068340	Wire's in there?
7068340	7069340	No.
7069340	7070340	It's confetti.
7070340	7072340	It's happy birthday.
7072340	7073340	No.
7073340	7079140	Inside, you see billowing black smoke that pours into the room and swirls and begins
7079140	7086940	swirling and continues this swirling into a black dark vortex of powerful magical energy.
7086940	7098340	And you can hear a voice kind of scream out, I told you, he did tell you, I can confirm.
7099340	7102340	That you become more powerful than we could possibly imagine?
7102340	7103340	Something like that.
7103340	7104340	I can't go that far to confirm.
7104340	7105340	God damn it.
7105340	7106340	We shouldn't have.
7106340	7107340	We should have killed him.
7107340	7108340	We shouldn't have.
7108340	7111340	This is like the second time you've taken off his head and something like this has happened.
7111340	7112340	Right.
7112340	7113340	What?
7113340	7114340	Yeah.
7114340	7115340	I don't even remember the other one.
7115340	7116340	Thanks, Adam.
7116340	7117340	He knows.
7117340	7118340	He knows.
7118340	7119340	Yeah.
7119340	7123940	I yell out, what do you want from us, Admiral Darkstar?
7123940	7128940	You hear no response, only the roaring vortex of magical power.
7128940	7131940	Dispel that shit.
7131940	7132940	Shut up.
7132940	7133940	Who has...
7133940	7136940	All right.
7136940	7138940	Does somebody have...
7138940	7141940	Dispel that shit on their character sheet?
7141940	7142940	No.
7142940	7146940	He might as well be calling out, achieve victory.
7146940	7148940	Remember there's black smoke around us.
7148940	7151940	I cast achieve victory.
7152940	7154940	You achieve victory.
7157940	7159940	Because he's really just going away, right?
7159940	7161940	I wave the smoke around like a fart.
7161940	7164940	The smoke continues to spin and it spins downward,
7164940	7167940	kind of like a spiral funnel cloud and it kind of...
7167940	7170940	You see it go through the ground and then it disappears.
7170940	7171940	Yeah.
7171940	7173940	So it's kind of like the worst episodes of Lost.
7173940	7174940	Kind of.
7176940	7180940	But before you can react, you hear a rumbling followed by a cracking,
7180940	7184940	followed by an explosion of stone from the floor below.
7184940	7189940	As you see a metal clawed hand, maybe about seven feet long,
7189940	7195940	seven feet in some dimension, smash through the floor.
7195940	7200940	It's a metal claw and it grabs, it attempts to grab, quark.
7200940	7201940	It grabs quark.
7201940	7202940	Oh, not me.
7202940	7206940	And grabs him and begins pulling him towards this stone hole
7206940	7209940	and it's like, it's anxiety inducing.
7209940	7211940	It builds tension.
7213940	7214940	Almost like a cliffhanger?
7214940	7216940	Oh, it's a cliffhanger.
7216940	7217940	Cliffhanger!
7217940	7218940	All right!
7223940	7225940	Thank you once and all.
7225940	7227940	Harmontown.
7227940	7228940	Give it up for Ian.
7235940	7236940	Camille Nanciani.
7236940	7238940	Thank you, everyone.
7239940	7240940	Thank you.
7242940	7244940	Brody Stevens earlier on.
7244940	7245940	Dang it.
7245940	7248940	And all of our lovely harmonites and harmonians.
7248940	7250940	I'm Jeff Davis, your mayor.
7253940	7254940	Jan Harmon.
7254940	7255940	Hello.
7256940	7260940	I have to go back to the community offices where the writers are waiting for me
7260940	7264940	because we have to finish writing the episode that shoots tomorrow.
7264940	7269940	If I shoot through like an aloof meteor to my car, don't judge me.
7269940	7272940	Well, Special Crittenden too, everybody.
7276940	7279940	I meant to hit Xanadu, but my fingers were too fat
7279940	7283940	and I hit a country song for no reason, so pretend it's Xanadu.
7283940	7284940	I love you all.
7284940	7285940	Good night.
