0	25000	On a boulevard called Sunset in a woods called Holly, there is a town that exists named Harman.
25000	31000	It is my duty and privilege to declare that Harman Town is once again in session, y'all.
36000	44000	Let's all lower our heads and raise our eyes and welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
47000	50000	Thank you. Thank you very much.
56000	61000	Will you workshop something with me? It's been in my head. We were in the green room.
62000	73000	So, milk, milk, lemonade, round the corner fudge is made, push the button, pull the chain, outcome chocolate, choo choo train.
74000	77000	But I don't like the melody on the second half, like it's not satisfying.
78000	87000	We're combining milk, milk, milk, lemonade, round the corner fudge is made, fudge is made.
88000	90000	That's the first line.
91000	93000	How would you resolve something like that melodically?
94000	105000	Milk, milk, lemonade, round the corner fudge is made, push the button, pull the chain, outcome chocolate, choo choo train.
105000	125000	Milk, milk, lemonade, round the corner, milk, milk, lemonade, round the corner fudge is made, push the button, pull the chain, outcome chocolate, choo choo train.
125000	135000	Alright, that's great. I hope you guys know that that's about taking a shit and peeing and stuff.
136000	140000	I feel like just having done that 20 seconds of podcasts we've made up for last week.
141000	146000	Certainly a little more mainstream accessible than the last hour or so of last week.
147000	152000	Hey man, weekly podcast off the top of our head unedited, take the good with the bad and fuck off.
152000	162000	Alright, so let's see, my garage stinks. I need glasses. I'd like to commit 100% to D&D tonight.
163000	172000	I'm wondering about premium gas. I've been thinking about what has the species accomplished other than things relative to the species.
173000	176000	I'd like to know how Spencer's enjoying being my assistant.
176000	181000	I'm going to seek Donnelly's here tonight, our aneurysm surviving friend. I would like to speak with us for a little bit.
182000	190000	I had an emotional memory about Brown Deer, Wisconsin on the 4th of July that made me sad tonight.
191000	197000	And I'd like to talk about, Spencer, about possible improvements to my pad of paper device.
198000	206000	Because it must be said to the home listener that you are not reading, it's so much more efficient than reading off your phone. You're reading off of the iHarmon chest notes.
207000	213000	Well listen to how much shit just tonight, this is one page from tonight, I used this thing while driving over here.
214000	217000	That is still illegal. You're still not allowed to do that.
218000	221000	I'm sure it is, but I mean everything, being human is illegal.
222000	227000	That's actually more dangerous than texting because that must take two hands to do that.
228000	232000	No, no, less. Like Erin was driving with me, you can ask her. With this you could just...
233000	236000	You almost committed aggravated vehicular manslaughter.
237000	245000	I'm not going to defend any of my behavior, but I will tell you that this was safer while driving than texting.
246000	249000	None of which is safe. You shouldn't be doing anything but drive while you're driving.
250000	253000	And loving all races and sexual orientations.
255000	257000	And invading Syria.
258000	260000	Just some things to knock out.
261000	262000	Dan, how do you feel about Syria?
263000	266000	You know, we've got to get in there and see what's going on.
268000	270000	Right now it's like Schrodinger's country.
271000	274000	Are they a threat or not? There's only one way to find out. Open the box.
275000	278000	Get in there. I don't know, man.
279000	282000	But if they are Schrodinger's country and we open it up and they're not a threat...
283000	285000	Well, you know, the witch sunk.
288000	290000	You know, the old witch thing. You throw the lady in the water.
291000	294000	If she floats, she's a witch. If she's sank, she's shit.
295000	297000	They don't sink, they just drown.
298000	304000	Right. I think if you look up drowning in the dictionary, it will say sinking.
305000	306000	As a human.
306000	309000	Human bodies float after they drown because they fill up with gas.
310000	311000	Oh, boy.
312000	316000	I think for the part that's killing you, you're underwater. Otherwise...
317000	320000	But you're not a witch because you sink to the bottom of the lake.
321000	325000	No, if you're not a witch, you drown. Right? That was the whole point of that?
330000	332000	Okay, here's the thing that I wanted to talk to you about.
333000	336000	You read a list. I have my favorite thing to start with.
337000	340000	I want to go right into your problem with premium gas.
342000	344000	No, I don't have a problem. I have a question.
345000	346000	Is it...
349000	351000	Should I be getting premium gas?
352000	354000	Is it just a scam for just rich people?
355000	356000	Do you own or lease your car?
357000	359000	I own it. Then buy premium gas.
360000	361000	No.
363000	364000	It's for certain types of cars.
365000	366000	Sports cars.
367000	368000	It makes your engine better.
370000	374000	It's like Sesame Street in here, but instead of talking about it, I'll build it.
375000	378000	The harper town audience is as divided as Congress is about Syria right now.
380000	383000	How many are undecided on Syria and on premium gas right now?
384000	387000	I think there's probably a stone that could kill both of those birds.
393000	394000	Or a missile.
396000	399000	Who considers themselves an expert on this issue?
400000	401000	Mechanics, gasoline, whatever.
402000	403000	The premium gas thing. That's Syria.
406000	407000	Do we have a Syria expert?
408000	410000	I've got a hand shooting up in the middle. Are you sort of a gas...
411000	412000	I'm not an expert, but I looked into it for my own car.
413000	415000	Would you be willing to come up here for just a moment?
416000	417000	Sure.
423000	424000	Premium gas segment.
425000	427000	This is the premium gas segment. You can grab one of those mics.
428000	429000	What's your name, sir?
430000	431000	I'm Gabe.
432000	434000	Thank you for joining us here at the Harman Town Meeting.
435000	436000	What did you learn about premium gas?
437000	441000	I learned that my car takes premium gas and I have to put it in or something goes wrong with my car.
442000	443000	What kind of car do you have?
444000	446000	I have an Acura. It's an old Acura.
447000	448000	Really? It needs premium gas?
449000	452000	If it says requires premium, then you have to put it in.
453000	459000	If they say recommends premium, then you can put a lower octane in and it still works like the engine will adjust to it.
460000	462000	All right, so I have a Prius.
463000	464000	Does it say it requires premium?
465000	466000	I didn't look it up.
467000	469000	No, so you don't need to put in premium.
470000	472000	It's like the engine is tuned for whatever octane that they say.
473000	475000	I think the big selling point was you barely need to put in any gas.
476000	477000	It's got a big battery in it.
478000	479000	You have to put in gas.
480000	481000	Some.
482000	483000	Always there has to be some gas.
484000	485000	There's some in there. It gets alarmed when there's none in there.
486000	487000	Are you going to get a Tesla at some point?
488000	491000	The Tesla is like, I think it's like 500 grand and there's a waiting list.
492000	493000	No, it's like 60 grand.
494000	494000	
495000	496000	There's levels of Tesla.
497000	502000	Well, I don't want the Tesla coach, the Tesla economy.
503000	505000	It's like a little golf cart, but it's technically a Tesla.
506000	507000	It's like 60 or 80 depending on how much you spend.
508000	509000	All right.
510000	511000	I have to research it more.
512000	514000	If it's under 100 grand, I might celebrate.
515000	516000	You don't want it?
517000	518000	No, no, no.
519000	522000	If it's under 100, I'll think about it again.
523000	524000	I've had my car for a long time.
525000	526000	This is a horrible direction.
527000	528000	Premium gas is something that everyone can relate to.
529000	531000	Listening to me talk about what car I want to buy next.
532000	533000	That's bad entertainment.
534000	535000	All right.
536000	537000	Thank you, Gabe.
537000	538000	It's your book.
539000	540000	I'm reading your book.
541000	542000	Your book.
543000	544000	Gabe.
545000	546000	Gas knowledge Gabe.
547000	548000	Gas Dave.
549000	550000	Premium Gabe.
553000	557000	Boy, I hit you with a tornado of topics and you just latched onto the worst.
558000	560000	Like the most mundane.
561000	566000	It's funny when you get attached to the mundane because you live in a rarefied realm of craziness.
567000	571000	When you get bogged down with plumbing or your gas, that's funny.
572000	573000	Here's the thing I'd like to talk to you about.
574000	575000	And I'd like to workshop this idea with you.
576000	579000	Can we talk about the fact that backstage right before we came on,
580000	581000	and we don't talk about it a lot before the show starts,
582000	585000	Dan was singing the milk, milk, lemonade.
586000	587000	And he said, Jeff, what is the chain?
588000	589000	What was your question there?
590000	591000	What's the button?
592000	593000	I know the chain's your dick.
594000	595000	Someone else asked what the chain is.
595000	597000	Spencer asked, the belly button is your button.
598000	599000	Spencer said, what's the chain? It's your dick.
600000	601000	No, I think Aaron said, what's the chain?
602000	603000	Maybe.
604000	605000	Spencer.
606000	607000	I thought the button might have been a nipple.
608000	610000	But then when you said it was your belly button, that made more sense.
611000	612000	That might make me poop.
614000	616000	Pushing the belly button and then pulling my dick.
618000	619000	Because that's never happened before.
620000	621000	Whereas lots of people have touched my nipple.
622000	626000	You preferred to your penis as a little purple choo-choo train before.
627000	629000	Oh, yeah. Well, all aboard.
633000	634000	Well, not all.
635000	637000	One at a time.
638000	640000	No, I want to talk to you, Jeff, about...
641000	646000	Okay, so I was in bed today all day with my lover, Aaron McGathey.
647000	649000	Not doing anything sexy or anything.
649000	655000	Doing something that we love to do, which is sit and watch movies and eat pizza.
656000	660000	That might embarrass her, because she would rather you think that we were sitting in bed lifting weights or something.
661000	662000	Or making love.
663000	665000	Well, she would probably love for you to think that too, yeah.
666000	668000	I don't need you to have that mental image.
669000	673000	I'd rather you see me sitting in bed with one of those back pillows watching.
674000	675000	You guys eat pizza in bed?
676000	677000	Fuck yeah, yeah.
678000	681000	It's the best relationship ever, and we both love that.
682000	684000	That is something I've never done. I've never had a pizza while in bed.
685000	687000	I've never eaten a pizza of supine before.
688000	690000	Welcome to every Sunday at Danadu.
691000	696000	Yeah, we wake up, and then we roll over and grab the remote.
697000	701000	And there's a flat panel on the wall, and then you just go to the Apple TV.
702000	703000	I mean, this is just unrepentant teachbaggery.
704000	705000	And who gets out of bed?
706000	708000	She grubs the hub. Yeah, eat 24.
709000	711000	Who gets out of bed to actually get the pizza from the front door?
712000	714000	Or does the grub hub gentleman come in and get in bed with you?
716000	721000	And there's an extra pillow for him, and he has to watch Die Hard 2 with you.
722000	726000	Whoever's got pajama bottoms on at the time, there's a negotiation, you know.
727000	729000	People get each other water, aspirin things.
730000	731000	So, anyways.
732000	733000	So, Aaron gets it.
733000	736000	So, no, I usually do the hunting and gathering. Thank you.
739000	741000	That is neither hunting nor gathering.
743000	745000	It's all relative to a sedentary lifestyle.
746000	748000	That is the most hunting and gathering that's going to get done this week.
749000	751000	I'm surprised you even have the energy and the fortitude
752000	754000	to put your little eye-harmon around your neck in the morning.
755000	757000	That to me seems like a physical exertion for you.
758000	759000	Yeah, it's not easy.
760000	765000	So, I was getting out of bed today to come to do the show.
766000	768000	Yes, that's how long we stayed in bed.
769000	770000	We had a perfect Sunday.
771000	774000	We watched some Ryan Gosling crap and ate some pizza.
775000	777000	There is no such thing as Ryan Gosling crap.
781000	785000	So, some movie about him where he says very little,
785000	791000	says very little, has lazy eyes and drives a vehicle to moody needle drops.
792000	794000	I just described four Ryan Gosling with this.
795000	796000	That's the only three I've seen.
797000	799000	I could narrow it down by tattoos.
800000	803000	I could go, like, oh, it's the one where the hamburger's on his bicep.
807000	811000	But I could not narrow it down by saying, oh, it's the one that dissolves to, like, synth music
811000	818000	as he proceeds to set down an autumn leaf festooned country highway.
820000	822000	You've still got three movies to guess from there.
823000	824000	All right, shut up.
826000	831000	Getting out of bed to come to the show, I was overcome with the sensation that I'm sure we've all had,
832000	833000	which is that I would rather stay in bed.
834000	837000	No offense to these people or the show, like, I'm glad I'm here now because I get to talk about this.
837000	843000	But I was thinking on the drive here and wrote down in my pad, while going 40 miles an hour down sunset,
844000	847000	that, like, okay, so, and please workshop this with me.
848000	850000	I'm not presenting this as a thing that I know is going to work.
851000	855000	And I don't want all your little hole-pokers coming out and poking holes in this.
856000	857000	I want you to build something with me.
858000	859000	It's called brainstorming.
860000	863000	It's called yes and work on this with me.
864000	865000	It's not going to sound foolproof immediately.
866000	870000	It's not going to, it's not going to nestle perfectly within our society.
871000	873000	But it might be something that builds society around.
874000	877000	So, do you know how the Amish have that, what do they call it, ramen-spronging thing?
878000	879000	Ramen-spronging thing?
880000	881000	Yes.
882000	884000	They, you know, Google it, I'm sure.
887000	892000	The, you know, they're Amish and then, like, on their, you know, when they become adolescent Amish people,
892000	898000	and then the Amish hive says to them, like, go, go be not Amish for summer.
899000	900000	It doesn't matter, I don't care.
901000	905000	But they have it to the, I'm not saying it's, I don't know anything about it, I don't care.
906000	908000	I just know that they go off and they be not Amish for a while.
909000	911000	It's their chance to decide whether they want to come back into the fold.
912000	913000	Did you become Amish in the drive here?
914000	919000	I was just thinking about that in relation to my bed experience, where I don't, I didn't, I wanted to stay in bed.
919000	925000	So, I don't know, like, working title, bed, bed-spronging, okay?
926000	930000	It's, like, I'm riffing here, like, help me workshop it.
931000	933000	I don't, I'm just, with bad pitch, and let's build on this.
934000	942000	Once a month, the worker at Harman Town, the average citizen, whoever you are, there's no hierarchy,
943000	945000	he's just the person, a Harman Town citizen.
946000	954000	You're in bed, and you have to stay in bed until you can't stand being in bed anymore.
955000	956000	That's it.
957000	960000	That's called depression.
963000	965000	No, staying in bed is called depression.
966000	967000	Getting out of bed is called enthusiasm.
968000	969000	That's called recovery.
969000	975000	Yeah, and it's, yes, it's also called rebirth and recalibration of your mind and spirit.
976000	978000	Like, you're going, oh, I'm getting out of bed for a reason.
979000	984000	We all are always getting out of bed against our most fervent wishes, usually.
985000	987000	How often are you leaping out of bed?
988000	991000	For me, when it rains, when it's raining outside, I love, I can't wait to be out in the rain.
992000	994000	My girlfriend hates the rain, because she's Scottish.
995000	997000	We have like, we're totally different.
998000	999000	She'd rather never go outside when it rains.
1000000	1002000	For me, right here, pitter-pats of rain, I must be outside.
1003000	1004000	Yeah?
1005000	1006000	Okay.
1008000	1011000	I'm saying, there are instances when it's good to be out of bed.
1012000	1013000	Yeah.
1015000	1020000	Just proposing this idea, Jeff, that people have to stay in bed until they realize that they want to get out of bed.
1021000	1022000	For you, it would be when it started to rain.
1022000	1028000	Why don't you make communities so successful that we can build a bedroom big enough that we could do harm in town in your bedroom?
1030000	1032000	It's so that each audience member could have a bed.
1034000	1036000	Now you're talking about a cult, but...
1039000	1050000	Well, you know the difference between a cult and a society is, you know, longevity, solvency, success, you know?
1051000	1054000	I'm going to talk to you about a 200-year-old cult called America.
1055000	1057000	It worked out just fine until recently.
1060000	1061000	All right, so...
1063000	1067000	I mean, obviously, you're not going to help me make that idea work, and we'll get back to that.
1068000	1069000	It's bolder than 200 years.
1070000	1072000	What are we going to do for Halloween?
1073000	1078000	Look, last year we all dressed up as Jareth from Labyrinth.
1079000	1081000	I spent a lot of money on that costume.
1082000	1083000	I'm coming as Jareth again.
1085000	1086000	I mean, unless...
1087000	1094000	Look, Halloween is one of those three, four-day-long experiences where you can dress up as a cowboy one night and a sexy fireman the other night,
1095000	1096000	and then we can all dress up as whatever.
1097000	1099000	But one of those nights, I'm fucking Jareth again.
1100000	1103000	Don't you think it's nice when we all at harm in town dress as something?
1104000	1105000	We should all dress up as Jareth.
1105000	1106000	All David Bowie's.
1107000	1108000	Different Bowie?
1109000	1111000	What's your pitch?
1112000	1114000	My pitch is all Spencer's.
1115000	1123000	See, I don't like that because you said that in front of Spencer, and Spencer didn't look pleased about that.
1124000	1127000	Here's some other thing Spencer doesn't look pleased when you say...
1128000	1129000	Warning, Spencer.
1130000	1133000	No, no, no. We found out last week that you're a bad person and Spencer's fine.
1134000	1136000	Spencer is not just pleased by everything.
1137000	1140000	Spencer doesn't need a bunch of people to come in at beards and lumberjack shirts and shards.
1141000	1142000	I'm not doing it for him.
1143000	1144000	I know. That's why it's a bad idea.
1145000	1148000	So we should not do things that one person is going to be upset by?
1149000	1150000	Yes. Can we dress as Dan Harmon?
1151000	1161000	Here's the thing. Dressing like a person that is not an actual iconic figure, if we leave here, if we leave the sexy confines of Meltdown,
1161000	1167000	and we go out to a bar afterwards, we're dressed as Spencer, we just look like people with bad beards and ponytails.
1168000	1171000	And then that doesn't resonate anymore. And my concern is that two things.
1172000	1176000	One, Spencer doesn't like the fact that we're all either paying tribute or mocking him in some way.
1177000	1179000	And the second thing, we go somewhere else and we look homeless.
1181000	1185000	I mean, that's kind of a pretty, like, way too backhanded kidney punch.
1186000	1191000	Here's why. Beards, the quality of Spencer's beard, you cannot get at a beard store.
1192000	1199000	There's no such thing as a place. What you're going to get is a shitty fucking Hollywood boulevard, Hammurabi-looking, bad, shitty beard.
1200000	1208000	And you cannot get a wig as sexy as his long, metal hair that he's neatly confined to a mysterious ponytail.
1209000	1213000	Then you've got to get the right glasses. And then nobody really has this build.
1214000	1218000	It's just going to look like bad mimicry, which I think doesn't do anybody any service.
1219000	1223000	Alright. So your pitch is just to do Jareth again.
1224000	1230000	No, I'm saying, I'd be ever picking something else. I don't think we should all mimic one of our friends that wouldn't resonate to the rest of the world.
1231000	1236000	Also, hard to look like Spencer. You have a fucking, like, you're closer because you already have kind of a beard.
1237000	1238000	You don't have a Spencer beard.
1238000	1244000	What's the endgame with the rest of the world? You like the idea of going to a bar and having everyone go, why are you all Mickey Mouse?
1245000	1246000	And we go, we're because we're friends.
1247000	1255000	We're going to be here for two hours. Then we're going to probably want to go somewhere else and we're going to have to explain to everybody, oh, we're that guy.
1256000	1263000	And he's going to go, hmm, I don't care. That happened. Why? Who knows, man?
1264000	1273000	The whole night is going to be on him to deal with why we all dress like him. It's going to, I think it would be embarrassing for Spencer.
1274000	1278000	Okay. So is it about Spencer? Is it about the reaction of the bartender?
1279000	1280000	First and foremost.
1281000	1284000	Or is it about accuracy of costume or is it because you think Spencer looks homeless?
1285000	1286000	No.
1287000	1292000	I'm picturing my best attempt at looking like Spencer and I'm going to look like a shitty Spencer and nobody wins at that point.
1293000	1299000	All right. First and foremost, I think Spencer is the concern and not because he gives a shit, but I think that that's a burden.
1300000	1305000	Okay. All right. This has been great. It's automatically entertaining.
1306000	1311000	One person suggests something and the other person says no. This has been a half hour of this so far.
1312000	1313000	I think it's a bad idea.
1314000	1315000	Tell me why you think it's a good idea.
1315000	1316000	Why do you think it's a good idea?
1317000	1320000	I think it's a good idea because...
1323000	1324000	I'll take ten.
1325000	1326000	What are you doing right now?
1327000	1328000	I'm joking.
1329000	1332000	I mean, what I'm suggesting to you is that you're...
1334000	1338000	There's absolutely no value add to you explaining why something shouldn't be done.
1339000	1344000	And you also didn't have a very good first pitch which was the idea of recycling your expensive Halloween costume.
1345000	1349000	That was also a joke. Out of laziness I would do that, but let's think of another one.
1350000	1354000	You don't get a second motion from the Spencer thing from me.
1355000	1356000	Does anyone else want to come to Spencer?
1357000	1358000	No, no, no. We're moving out.
1359000	1366000	That's 15 minutes of someone saying no to somebody about something. That's long enough.
1367000	1368000	I got another hour and a half of me.
1369000	1373000	All right. My garage smells like mildew. We'll save that for next week.
1374000	1377000	Let's pump that down the road. I'm going to ask for some volunteers. We're going to go in there and clean it up.
1378000	1383000	I think I may need glasses. I had to skip an optometry appointment. I'm 40 years old.
1384000	1387000	I think it's just become time for me to have glasses. I'm afraid. I don't know.
1388000	1391000	I was looking at the billboards coming in here.
1392000	1395000	I can't tell a Vince Vaughn from a Grand Theft Auto character anymore.
1396000	1399000	You are holding your eye, Harmon, closer and closer to your face.
1400000	1405000	It's a thing. I don't know. It's a new segment tonight.
1406000	1410000	Tell me what kind of music theme you think you want. Downbeat, funky, old school?
1411000	1412000	Do you have something provincial?
1413000	1414000	Provincial.
1415000	1418000	So I can find out what that word means when I hear it.
1419000	1421000	I'll pick a province and I'll go with it.
1421000	1428000	This segment is called Aaron McGathey asks questions about the Grand Theft Auto 5 billboard.
1438000	1439000	Aaron McGathey.
1442000	1443000	Hello.
1444000	1445000	How are you doing?
1446000	1452000	So we were driving down Sunset and you saw a big billboard for Grand Theft Auto 5, which is coming out this month.
1453000	1456000	You had some questions about the billboard.
1457000	1459000	Who is that guy?
1460000	1462000	He's just a guy that you can play in Grand Theft Auto 5, I'm assuming.
1463000	1466000	Is he a special guy because he's just wearing a polo shirt?
1467000	1473000	He's a guy that you'll be able to play in Grand Theft Auto 5. He's not currently famous within the Grand Theft Auto universe.
1473000	1478000	So then why is he on the advertisement? Why am I driving down the street and I see a giant guy?
1479000	1491000	Because Christian Bale isn't in the game and the Grand Theft Auto 5 audience is built in and so they're just reminding you, oh this huge video game is coming out with a new release and here's our stylistic kind of...
1492000	1493000	Is he supposed to be a real person?
1494000	1500000	I'm really distracted by Tyler raising his hands. We're actually just repeating our conversation from before.
1501000	1503000	I mean there's no... I don't know what...
1504000	1505000	You just want to raise your hand?
1506000	1508000	They're doing their conversation again.
1509000	1511000	Oh boy, you guys are the worst.
1518000	1519000	I wish!
1520000	1521000	That's the best day of my life.
1522000	1525000	Erin's questions about the Grand Theft Auto billboard.
1525000	1530000	Yeah, and just to let you guys behind the curtain a little bit, we have this conversation so that's the bit.
1531000	1532000	But it's not a bit.
1533000	1536000	Not that I ever stopped and went, this is the best conversation of the world. We should have it again.
1537000	1539000	I just wanted you to ask your questions again.
1540000	1541000	So here are my real questions.
1542000	1545000	So, okay. I'm sorry. Now I'm in my head.
1546000	1549000	But I'm going to think about the actual way that I feel about this billboard.
1550000	1553000	So he's just holding a bunch of money. It's Grand Theft Auto 5, right?
1554000	1557000	I don't know why I said it that way. Grand Theft Auto 5.
1558000	1562000	It's Grand Theft Auto 5, so why is there not a special character on the billboard?
1563000	1564000	Why is the billboard just like my dentist?
1565000	1568000	He's a guy that likes to steal cars. Put your hand down, Tyler.
1570000	1572000	Don't you understand the question? The answers don't matter.
1573000	1574000	Is it rhetorical?
1575000	1577000	No, they're not rhetorical, but the answers don't matter.
1578000	1582000	This is what she doesn't understand, is that Grand Theft Auto 5 could put a fucking turd on a billboard.
1583000	1585000	And say, remember to buy Grand Theft Auto 5.
1586000	1587000	And I keep explaining that to you. It doesn't matter.
1588000	1591000	Like when the Batman 9 movie comes out, they're not going to...
1592000	1596000	They don't go like, all right, make sure that we show Batman doing something awesome.
1597000	1600000	But he's definitely like in a shadow, or he's at least wearing his bat outfit.
1601000	1603000	Just to let you know that there's a Batman movie. That's all they care about.
1604000	1606000	Okay, so Tyler, this is a real question about Grand Theft Auto.
1607000	1609000	So that man in the polo, he's a man we know.
1610000	1612000	There's three different characters in the new Grand Theft Auto game.
1613000	1614000	But he's not a man we know.
1615000	1616000	He's not a man we know.
1617000	1619000	Okay, exactly. So he's just a man wearing a polo shirt.
1621000	1624000	He's looked exactly like all of the other past Grand Theft Auto characters.
1625000	1626000	Okay, so is that the...
1627000	1628000	That's amazing.
1629000	1631000	Okay, so Laura, Lauren?
1632000	1634000	Someone just called her racist for saying that.
1635000	1637000	Lauren just said that he looks like all the characters in the game.
1638000	1642000	Okay, so it was the idea that it's like, ah, yeah, they're back at it again.
1643000	1644000	Or a white man in a polo shirt.
1645000	1649000	Yeah, my favorite video game company is making my favorite video game again.
1650000	1652000	Yeah, it's like a guy, just any guy.
1653000	1654000	It might have been a woman in a bikini.
1655000	1658000	Well, what I was saying earlier is like, I would all...
1659000	1662000	I mean, even though it's so misogynist, I'm almost like,
1663000	1666000	where are the girls with the giant crazy pumpkin breasts?
1667000	1670000	Why is it just this man and this polo shirt holding a bunch of cash?
1670000	1673000	I've never played the game, but from what I know, they're probably being raped by a car, right?
1674000	1674000	
1675000	1677000	So, which is why people play that game, right?
1678000	1679000	I know that's not why you play the game.
1680000	1683000	By the way, I feel like you guys are being really mean or weird or not mean.
1684000	1685000	No, they're not.
1686000	1687000	Not mean, not mean, not mean.
1688000	1689000	What the hell?
1690000	1691000	Let it go.
1692000	1693000	Let it go.
1694000	1697000	All right, look, there's only one way to resolve this.
1697000	1698000	There's only one way to resolve this.
1699000	1700000	I feel silly about this now.
1701000	1704000	We have to have a new segment called Tyler's Answers About Grand Theft Auto.
1705000	1706000	He's going to explode.
1709000	1711000	Okay, and I have actual questions.
1712000	1718000	So, in every Grand Theft Auto game, is it always just a generic looking man with a polo shirt?
1719000	1720000	There's a new protagonist in every game.
1721000	1722000	And that's not what I asked.
1723000	1725000	In the other games, is it just always men and polos?
1725000	1726000	No.
1727000	1728000	What are the heroes usually?
1729000	1732000	In the previous one, it was a guy from the Eastern Bloc.
1733000	1734000	His name was Nico.
1735000	1736000	He kind of played an immigrant.
1737000	1738000	You were new to America.
1739000	1740000	He was in New York.
1741000	1743000	He was kind of trying to leave his old life behind, but it caught up with him and he did that again.
1744000	1746000	So, is the purpose of the Bulbert to be like, we're back to a white guy?
1747000	1749000	I honestly don't know the purpose of Back to a White Guy.
1750000	1751000	Are they pulling back from a special thing?
1752000	1753000	There's three guys in the new game.
1753000	1754000	There's a dude in polo shirt.
1755000	1759000	There's a dude coming out of the hood trying to leave the old hood mentality behind.
1760000	1762000	Crazy guy who is kind of a psychopath.
1763000	1765000	There's the three things and they're like, let's all get together and do heists.
1766000	1767000	That's the point behind the new one.
1768000	1769000	How do they know each other?
1770000	1771000	I don't know. I haven't played the game.
1772000	1773000	But you seem to know a lot about it.
1774000	1775000	I know this from the marketing material they've done so far.
1776000	1778000	Erin, are you asking these questions because you want to get into Grand Theft Auto?
1779000	1780000	Is this your new thing?
1781000	1783000	I'm pretty sure Grand Theft Auto would make me cry.
1784000	1785000	No, I don't want to get in.
1786000	1787000	It's not that bad.
1788000	1789000	Well, I don't like thievery.
1790000	1791000	Okay.
1793000	1795000	Theft is a big part of the Grand Theft Auto game.
1796000	1798000	I respect other people's property.
1801000	1802000	I don't like running over people.
1803000	1807000	With each new release, there are more and more non-criminal elements you could focus on.
1808000	1809000	You could go to a bowling alley.
1810000	1812000	That's what I was asking before, like him just holding the cash.
1813000	1815000	If I didn't know what it was, I'd be like, oh, this guy just got back from the bank.
1816000	1817000	Oh, man.
1818000	1820000	He's going to apply for his mother's loan.
1822000	1826000	Seriously, you look at the bill, you're like, oh, man, that guy went to Chase and withdrew $2,000.
1827000	1828000	What is he doing? Is he buying a pool?
1829000	1830000	Not seriously.
1831000	1832000	Not literally.
1833000	1834000	Literally.
1835000	1837000	Okay, so more questions.
1838000	1844000	Has there ever been, and I'm not saying this defensively, but has there ever been a female marauder?
1845000	1849000	There has never been a female protagonist in a Grand Theft Auto or any game by the people who made that game.
1850000	1851000	Okay, okay, okay.
1852000	1856000	So these polo people, what is the idea of that?
1857000	1865000	They actually had actual polo players where there was guys that were playing polo on the horse and they would get off and they would shoot a guy and get on his polo pony.
1866000	1867000	They're adding the polo sticks.
1868000	1874000	The previous Grand Theft Auto games to the one that came out where we had the guy in New York, they were kind of timepieces.
1875000	1878000	So like you had one that was set in the 80s and one that was set in the 90s and stuff.
1879000	1880000	They were kind of different characters.
1881000	1881000	
1882000	1883000	I like genre.
1884000	1885000	Totally. They were genre pieces. This is an 80s film.
1886000	1887000	But there's never going to be one in 19th century England.
1888000	1889000	I know. That's exactly what it is.
1890000	1891000	Picture good Jane Austen.
1892000	1895000	So this carriage, you're not on the agenda.
1896000	1898000	Why don't you step outside and let me take this carriage.
1899000	1900000	Have you guys played Grand Theft Handsome Cab?
1901000	1902000	Yeah.
1903000	1912000	So do you think the idea of the game is that these men are normal men because you're like, oh, I could be the thief.
1913000	1917000	What's the word I'm looking for? The car stealer? Is there a word for that?
1918000	1919000	Criminal?
1919000	1920000	Criminal?
1921000	1925000	Well, I didn't know if there was like burglar or I don't know, whatever. Don't question.
1926000	1935000	I think as technology increases and these computer systems have more memory and hard drive space and the chips are faster and blah, blah, blah.
1936000	1947000	The more they allow for simulation of reality, the easiest way to celebrate that newfound power is to sort of deconstruct not so much reality,
1947000	1954000	which I think violent video games are mistaken for like, oh, let's take reality and do horrible violent fantasies with them.
1955000	1958000	I think it's more a deconstruction of what you've previously been able to do within video games.
1959000	1969000	I grew up on pole position where you're just like, and if you go off the road, your car turns into eight more pixels and you're told that you lost.
1970000	1975000	And so the exhilarating power of being able to hit the F key and get out of your car, run over to another one,
1975000	1982000	hit the F key again, at which point your character opens that guy's car door, pulls him out, punches him in the face, throws him away and gets in that car.
1983000	1990000	It's not so much like I always wished I could do that. It's like I'm so glad this video game is allowing me to see more of the world.
1995000	1996000	Cut to us in bed today. I'm so happy.
1997000	2009000	And I got to say, I'm not trying to score points here, but I am very handicapped in these games by my absolute like, I have a very difficult time crossing the threshold where people are being victimized.
2010000	2013000	Even though they're kind of like randomly generated, like people, thanks baby.
2014000	2021000	But there always comes a point when you do cross that threshold on accident, like you just sort of, someone gets in the way and you hit them with a bat.
2021000	2031000	And then, and then you're like, oh, I'm fine. And then it starts to become, it's like, by the time you're done playing those games, you're kind of like exploring every horrible, masochistic.
2032000	2036000	I don't have flashbacks when I play Grand Theft Auto, like, oh man, I shouldn't have clubbed that hooker. I don't, that's not.
2037000	2046000	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, I know. But like, they're, I don't know, your mother all of a sudden, oh no, dear, I know you can play it as much as you want.
2047000	2051000	It's a fun game. You're like, I will bring in, handing you cookies.
2052000	2053000	Don't buy this for your children, please.
2054000	2058000	All right. Listen, if there's not, if there's not anything more pressing, we've got other segments to cover. Is that okay?
2059000	2059000	
2060000	2063000	You think you got it under control now? You see that guy in that billboard?
2064000	2066000	Any other really pressing questions about the billboard or nothing?
2067000	2071000	Aaron, are you just like, is there a concern in your mind that you're going to lose Dan to this game that you don't understand?
2072000	2075000	No, no, that won't happen. I can't go near this thing until December.
2076000	2080000	And then we're going to Scotland. I can't, I'm not, I'm not gonna, I'm gonna miss out on Grand Theft Auto 5.
2081000	2082000	It'll be there when you get back down.
2083000	2086000	You know what? You could, I'll dress up like a lady of the night.
2087000	2089000	I'll make you a little cardboard car.
2090000	2094000	Can I give you, can I give you five, five weird catchphrases to just say in a rattle?
2095000	2096000	Wait, what are the catchphrases?
2096000	2108000	Looking good, sugar. What's happening? That boy be tripping. Hey, hey, you want a party? And stop stealing that car.
2109000	2119000	For a short time, I was a, for a summer in LA, I was a tutor for kids in the eighth grade who were wanting to get into private high schools, an English tutor.
2119000	2129000	And the kid that I was, that I was tutoring or supposed to tutor, he got to have like a video game break and would just go and play Grand Theft Auto and just drive over people.
2130000	2135000	And he was a really shitty, shitty, shitty kid. And, and that sounds bad.
2136000	2139000	Is that a one-to-one correlation? You're like, oh, if you're driving over kids and Grand Theft Auto, you're terrible.
2140000	2147000	It wasn't his fault that he was a shitty kid. His, he, his, his dad owned Jeopardy and a million other things. He lives in an estate.
2147000	2157000	Yeah, totally. That was Murph Griffin. What? You tutored Ted Griffin? Damien Griffin? That's a weird correlation.
2158000	2165000	I'm not, has nothing to do with Jeopardy. I'm just saying that he, he comes from a family with a bazillion dollars and his parents don't pay attention to him.
2166000	2170000	Sure. He has a personal chef and someone who teaches him and his parents. He's raised by video games.
2171000	2172000	No, he's not raised by video games.
2173000	2176000	If history's any teacher, being born rich will make you shittier before video games do, that's for sure.
2177000	2178000	Yeah, it has nothing to do with video games.
2179000	2183000	Because they've been rich people for a long time and a healthy history of shitty people. And then video games just came along recently.
2184000	2185000	This is something for shitty people to do along with good people.
2186000	2188000	Right, yeah. I love video games. I've played video games in my life.
2189000	2192000	If he played Grand Theft Auto, he'd be raping a lot of people. He'd also already be bad.
2193000	2200000	This has nothing to do with video games. He, he, he was sad because his parents wouldn't hug him and they lived in the same house but wouldn't come to his wing of the house.
2201000	2202000	That's how crazy it was.
2203000	2204000	You sing that Merv and Linda Griffin would not come.
2205000	2210000	It all started when, when they finally got tired of his Richard Pryor and a plastic ball.
2214000	2221000	He did literally, does anyone know the name of that Japanese artist who would make those big sculptures of like plush sculptures and sometimes it would be like a mankind.
2222000	2223000	Coming on himself or like sometimes it would be...
2224000	2225000	What?
2226000	2229000	I, I, I expected a lot of people to, oh, Hiroshima, Nagasaki.
2230000	2232000	I don't know how common you think your Google alerts are.
2233000	2237000	Anyway, there's this, there's this pop, there's this pop, wait what?
2238000	2239000	Hiroshima, Nagasaki.
2240000	2241000	It's your idea of a Japanese face.
2242000	2243000	That's fake and racist.
2244000	2249000	I was, fun fact, I was born in Japan. But anyway, it doesn't matter. What I'm saying is there's this fine artist that was in town.
2249000	2252000	He had a giant sculpture by this artist in his room.
2253000	2260000	He just had a lot of money and he was so sad because his parents literally would not speak to him and he became like such a shitty sad kid.
2261000	2264000	They would only let him talk in the form of a question.
2270000	2272000	Oh, sorry. Why don't you love me?
2274000	2276000	What is I have to make pooping?
2280000	2289000	When I say, when I, when I say own Jeopardy, I mean owned the company that owns Jeopardy and Oprah and whatever.
2290000	2292000	The more specific you get, the more we have to delete out of this.
2293000	2296000	The broader we make it, the less we have to cut out of the show.
2297000	2300000	The point is, this is not a comment on Grand Theft Auto at all.
2301000	2303000	I don't think it's, I don't think that makes people bad and all that.
2304000	2305000	He would, he would play it just to run over people.
2305000	2309000	Like in his head, I would sit next to him and try to play it with him and be like, oh, let's, let's get on it.
2310000	2312000	Let's play it. There's a mission. Let's do a mission.
2313000	2314000	But he was like, I'm playing, I'm doing it.
2315000	2317000	And would just, just drive over.
2318000	2319000	Like in his mind, he's like, hey, mom.
2320000	2321000	Well, his mom wasn't there.
2322000	2323000	He had a picture of his mom.
2324000	2326000	He would say, I'm going to, I'm going to go play my video games now.
2327000	2328000	And just spent hours.
2329000	2334000	If you hit control F or F F like up, up, down, down, your character can put on a musical show.
2335000	2336000	Is there a game like that?
2337000	2338000	What was that game?
2339000	2342000	Grand Fame Theft Automatic.
2343000	2349000	You just jump out of the car and there's a plastic bucket and you start doing like a stomp thing and you have to build your way up to.
2350000	2351000	Grand Stage Attention Theft.
2352000	2353000	All right.
2354000	2356000	Let's, let's thank Aaron McGathey and Tyler Durden.
2357000	2358000	I don't know what your last name is.
2359000	2360000	Yeah, you're good.
2361000	2362000	Tyler Durden.
2363000	2364000	Thank you, Aaron.
2365000	2366000	Tyler Handen Raisin.
2367000	2371000	So excited that someone was asking questions, a girl no less, about Grand Theft Auto.
2372000	2373000	It wasn't, I don't know.
2374000	2375000	I was just entertained by her questions.
2376000	2381000	I was just like, she doesn't, I'm 40 years old and I'm still feeling like a 13 year old boy going like, you just don't get it.
2383000	2384000	I was like, it doesn't matter.
2385000	2386000	I don't care who that guy is.
2387000	2388000	I didn't even look at the guy's face.
2389000	2390000	I'm just seeing like Grand Theft Auto 5 and I'm like.
2392000	2393000	Anyways.
2393000	2394000	All right.
2394000	2397000	Well, let's, we have our old friend Seek is here.
2397000	2398000	Are you here, Seek?
2398000	2399000	Yeah.
2399000	2400000	Okay.
2400000	2401000	Can you make it up?
2401000	2403000	Are you feeling the strength?
2406000	2407000	Hey, buddy.
2414000	2422000	Seek is supporting the latest in Feral Audio fashion from FeralAudio.com, a place where you can go and make donations to support Feral Audio.
2423000	2426000	Feralio's network, which provides you with all kinds of shit.
2427000	2438000	I am told statistically that if everyone in our audience, not this audience, but our podcast audience, went there and donated $5 that we'd be able to make a podcast for four years.
2439000	2440000	I don't know where he got that statistic.
2441000	2442000	Made it up.
2443000	2444000	This one doesn't cost me anything.
2445000	2450000	He must be talking, maybe Chelsea Peretti, like maybe she, there's an overhead there.
2450000	2453000	Maybe she, maybe she needs like money.
2453000	2454000	I don't know.
2455000	2458000	I think it has to do with Dustin, you know, like not starving to death.
2458000	2465000	Well, he records and edits everyone's podcast and the people that do the website stuff.
2465000	2466000	So anyways, nice t-shirt.
2466000	2467000	How are you doing, Seek?
2467000	2468000	I'm doing good.
2468000	2469000	How are you?
2469000	2470000	Good.
2470000	2471000	How's everyone here?
2471000	2472000	All right.
2472000	2473000	You sound all right.
2473000	2474000	Yeah.
2474000	2478000	So what you specifically requested to come up tonight, you wanted to pay us a visit.
2478000	2480000	Yeah, actually, well, I've been feeling good lately.
2480000	2484000	So I wanted to come up when I had more energy than I did last time I came up.
2485000	2488000	But I kind of wanted to ask a question of the audience.
2489000	2490000	All right.
2490000	2491000	Who the fuck do you think you are?
2492000	2496000	And then he just throws down the mic and flies through the roof.
2500000	2502000	Holy shit, he was a superhero the whole time.
2503000	2507000	We were warned over and over again that you fucking people treat me like shit.
2508000	2510000	I could bend Jupiter with my mind.
2510000	2511000	Goodbye.
2512000	2515000	And then you just hear him as his voice trails off into the transfer.
2515000	2518000	He goes, code seven, proceed with the demolition.
2519000	2521000	Then the last thing we remember is the ground turning orange.
2523000	2524000	All right.
2524000	2525000	Sorry.
2525000	2526000	What were you?
2526000	2527000	You had me.
2527000	2528000	What was the question?
2528000	2532000	What if you actually just stole his actual thunder there?
2532000	2534000	I was going to do all of that.
2534000	2537000	Yeah, he's going to wait one more week now for it to have him back.
2538000	2539000	Code seven's off.
2540000	2543000	In my own special way, I'm a savior of humanity.
2545000	2550000	No, as some of you have been seeing on Twitter, I spent the last six weeks,
2551000	2555000	although I will admit I cheated and started before I was on the last episode,
2555000	2560000	but I've been drawing people from Harman Town as Mega Man characters,
2561000	2563000	which is my favorite video game.
2564000	2566000	Take that, Grand Theft Auto.
2567000	2571000	And it's one of the few really vivid childhood memories I have.
2571000	2577000	Not the visuals of it, but just I remember always being obsessed about it.
2577000	2582000	I think to the point where one day my mom raised me and my brother by herself
2582000	2586000	and she went on a date one night and then she came home at two in the morning
2586000	2591000	and my brother was asleep and I turned my entire room into a level from Mega Man.
2592000	2594000	And she was mad.
2595000	2598000	And my brother was asleep and I'm like jumping on the beds,
2598000	2601000	like shooting things at the wall that are moving.
2601000	2604000	When turning your room into any level from any video game
2604000	2606000	entails some tidiness?
2607000	2610000	I miss Mega Man. I'm a little older than you.
2610000	2613000	It's like Mario. It's like side-scrolling, I guess.
2613000	2615000	So yeah, there's just blocks floating in my room.
2615000	2617000	You made your room two-dimensional?
2618000	2620000	That's against a lot of building codes.
2620000	2623000	Yeah. So we didn't get the deposit back on the apartment.
2625000	2629000	But so I've been drawing people like, and I didn't want to just draw you guys.
2629000	2633000	Like I drew, because this show is, you guys have all kind of,
2633000	2637000	whether you know it or not, have kind of become like an extended family of mine.
2637000	2639000	And so I wanted to draw some of you too.
2639000	2643000	So I drew N.T. and Adam Goldberg and then I drew some of your guests.
2643000	2646000	I drew Dustin, obviously, and I spent a lot of times,
2646000	2652000	had two nosebleeds and one blackout, no seizures.
2652000	2655000	But I spent about seven weeks drawing all of these.
2655000	2658000	So I guess I was just curious if people were interested.
2658000	2661000	I was thinking about making prints and I ran the idea by Dan,
2661000	2663000	maybe make a very limited number of the prints
2663000	2666000	and we could sell them here like before a show one night.
2666000	2669000	I don't know. Maybe two nosebleeds?
2670000	2671000	I don't know.
2671000	2675000	That's why if you look on Twitter, I tweeted the original pictures
2675000	2677000	and then later you see them on completely different paper.
2677000	2680000	And it's because I had to use a lightbox to redraw it
2680000	2682000	because I bled on the previous paper.
2682000	2685000	I mean, that's not because of the art, right?
2685000	2690000	Well, it's because the amount of it takes to create something visual for me.
2690000	2692000	It takes a lot out of me.
2692000	2695000	Well, Jesus, Scott, I mean, well, that's, I mean, thank you.
2695000	2697000	But also...
2697000	2700000	I'm not saying I would normally bleed for harm in town.
2700000	2703000	It just happened. I wasn't expecting it. It just happened.
2703000	2706000	So what do I have to pull the trigger on?
2708000	2711000	You wanted to come and talk about this stuff and announce it.
2711000	2715000	I mean, I'm never sure because I got my head up my own ass.
2715000	2717000	I see tweets from you and emails and stuff.
2717000	2719000	The answer is yes, whatever you want to do.
2719000	2722000	Do you want to sell these things on the Harmontown store?
2722000	2726000	Well, I figured we would maybe do a batch for the group here
2726000	2730000	and then, you know, and then like maybe just make like, I don't know.
2730000	2733000	I don't know what a good number is, maybe 30 or 50 or 100.
2733000	2736000	And then anything we have left over after we sell to anyone here,
2736000	2738000	we can put on the Harmontown store if you want.
2738000	2741000	Yeah, yeah. Can we give the money to the Aneurysm Foundation or...
2741000	2742000	We can. I mean, I...
2742000	2744000	Or do you need it? If you need it, that's good enough for me.
2744000	2747000	I mean, I do, but I, I mean, I'd rather...
2747000	2752000	My mission, my self-given mission in life is to help them out.
2752000	2757000	So, you know, so I would, I mean, originally I wanted to give it to Fair Audio,
2757000	2760000	but you guys were like, screw that.
2760000	2762000	I was like, well, I'll buy a shirt then.
2762000	2766000	Dust, I can drink a couple of red bulls next month.
2766000	2770000	We can cut corners in our little smoky room.
2770000	2772000	But we could do that. Yeah, absolutely. Whatever. Yeah, we could do that.
2772000	2775000	All right. Well, whatever. Yeah, we'll figure it out.
2775000	2779000	But, so how have you been? Like, what's the, I mean,
2779000	2782000	I think that's the thing that's foremost on my mind.
2782000	2789000	Like, when is the last time you had a report of your condition?
2789000	2794000	It's just like you have this mysterious condition with an indefinite prognosis.
2794000	2800000	And I just, like, what is, what's going on when you talk to the doctors?
2800000	2803000	What do you know about what's...
2803000	2808000	Well, I mean, we just, I go in, I do tests probably every week mostly.
2808000	2813000	But some of the tests are physical, so sometimes they'll just have me run on a treadmill
2813000	2816000	and see how long I can last. And then sometimes it's blood work.
2816000	2819000	And sometimes it's CT scans or MRIs.
2819000	2821000	Is there water at the, behind the treadmill?
2821000	2822000	No. Yeah, no.
2822000	2824000	Well, then they're not getting an accurate result.
2824000	2827000	No, they're not really. They look at the pool of sharks behind me.
2827000	2829000	No, yeah, they're not. Yeah.
2829000	2831000	I mean, so, and what are they, are they telling you anything?
2831000	2836000	No, I mean, right now it's, I mean, they usually tell me things when it gets bad.
2836000	2842000	But right now, I mean, I'm just on a monitored system, so they just, they're, like we said last time,
2842000	2847000	because I'm experiencing things differently than most, they just keep a close eye on me.
2847000	2854000	But because anything can turn in my head at the last minute, they just have to constantly keep an eye on me.
2854000	2857000	So that's, so there's really, no news is always good news for me.
2857000	2859000	Yeah, but it's also the weirdest news in the world.
2859000	2860000	All the time.
2860000	2863000	Because you're like this coin flipping up in the air perpetually.
2863000	2865000	Yeah, it's like two faces just living in my head.
2865000	2866000	But the weird thing is it's a metaphor.
2866000	2869000	I mean, obviously that's, that's, that is all of our condition.
2869000	2870000	Well, of course, yeah.
2870000	2871000	That's the most, like.
2871000	2873000	Yeah, yeah. Well, no one, tomorrow's not promised anybody.
2873000	2874000	Yeah, you just.
2874000	2876000	That's why I deal with it really well, because I'm like, oh, you know, so-and-so,
2876000	2878000	something could happen to them tomorrow.
2878000	2879000	Yeah.
2879000	2880000	You know, so it's, it's not a.
2880000	2883000	But it's, like, frustrating to, it's like, somebody say something.
2883000	2887000	Somebody in a white lab coat say something, definitive, anything.
2887000	2891000	They're, they're probably wrong nine, nine out of ten times anyway, but someone, what is,
2891000	2894000	what is, it's like this weird Schrodinger's.
2894000	2897000	I mean, it does, but I, I'd ever open the box.
2897000	2898000	I don't want to know.
2898000	2902000	Like, it's better not to know, I think, for me anyway, because I have so much,
2902000	2904000	I'm trying to just live a normal life now.
2904000	2906000	So I, I put that first.
2906000	2909000	So I want to make sure I, if I wake up in the morning, that's step one.
2909000	2910000	I'm like, all right, cool. I'm here.
2910000	2912000	So now what do I got to do?
2912000	2913000	I'm like, okay, so now I got a new job.
2913000	2915000	So that's been like, that's why my head's been hurting a lot lately,
2915000	2917000	because the kind of the stress of it.
2917000	2919000	But I'm adapting now.
2919000	2921000	So, so things have kind of cooled off.
2921000	2922000	So it's.
2923000	2925000	But I saw that we were talking about on, on the subreddit,
2925000	2927000	the Harmontown subreddit, you're active in there.
2927000	2930000	And I remember seeing you saying something about how you probably shouldn't
2930000	2933000	be one of the hundred to go to the moon because for all you know,
2933000	2935000	what's happening is hereditary and.
2935000	2938000	Yeah, you could have 99, you know, like next week,
2938000	2940000	you know, the week after we moved there.
2940000	2941000	But we can make it 101.
2941000	2945000	And I also saw the, the, the, the, if you could be like a minister of,
2945000	2951000	of, of, of, of fear of death for, for other people that I could go to when I
2951000	2952000	go, I need glasses.
2952000	2954000	Tell me, tell me that that's not a big deal.
2954000	2958000	The, but more importantly, we toyed around.
2958000	2962000	So I saw being toyed around the concept of you being the person that chooses
2962000	2964000	the 100, which I would be fine with.
2964000	2966000	I think you would choose better than me.
2966000	2970000	Well, yeah, I mean, I look at, it's how I approach everything,
2970000	2974000	art, writing, like I look at things of who, like, I don't know,
2974000	2978000	I feel like that position should be someone that doesn't have an ultimate
2978000	2979000	stake in it.
2979000	2980000	Exactly.
2980000	2984000	So I thought, oh, someone who doesn't get to go to the moon colony should be
2984000	2986000	the one to pick the 100.
2986000	2987000	And I don't want to go by choice.
2987000	2990000	I want it to be a better society.
2990000	2994000	And I feel like a better society wouldn't have, wouldn't have to, wouldn't
2994000	2995000	look at me as a burden.
2995000	2997000	You know, like, that's what I, that's why I moved back here to LA.
2997000	3000000	Because when I was back home with my mom and recovering, I think that's all
3000000	3003000	she saw when she looked at me because there's a lot for her to process,
3003000	3007000	you know, like that, that I was mentally gone, you know, that she was like,
3007000	3009000	oh, my son doesn't remember things anymore.
3009000	3012000	So he's a, he, there's a part of him that's not my son anymore.
3012000	3015000	So I don't ever want to be a burden to anyone.
3015000	3018000	So I think that's why ultimately I was like, oh, I'll help pick the 100.
3018000	3022000	And then, and then I'll stay here and then you guys are going to need stuff
3022000	3023000	constantly.
3023000	3027000	So I figured that'd be good for me to be here at the teleporter, you know,
3027000	3031000	guarding it and making sure supplies are still getting to you.
3031000	3033000	Because I feel like once you go up there with your hundred, there's going to
3033000	3036000	be a lot of disgruntled people down here going, why didn't he choose me?
3036000	3038000	And they're going to want to cut you off.
3038000	3039000	Right.
3039000	3041000	And I feel like a Sikh about your problems.
3041000	3042000	Yeah, exactly.
3042000	3046000	I feel like few people will come up to me and go, all right, here's some extra
3046000	3048000	flower or whatever, send that to the moon.
3048000	3053000	But I think we could build a Sikh mannequin and have him down there in that
3053000	3057000	window that says back for lunch and we could smuggle you up to the moon.
3057000	3058000	Yeah, I mean, I'll visit.
3058000	3059000	I would like to visit.
3059000	3062000	My favorite comic book is a bunch of characters that live on the moon.
3062000	3063000	They're called the Inhumans.
3063000	3066000	So yeah, I love, I'm fascinated.
3066000	3069000	The first image I saw when I got out of the hospital was, or when I was
3069000	3072000	conscious of the hospital was the moon because I woke up at night and I got to
3072000	3074000	see this beautiful thing in the sky.
3074000	3077000	So I always been drawn to the show because of these little things.
3077000	3078000	I feel like.
3078000	3080000	It's such an amazing mythical thing, the moon.
3080000	3081000	It is.
3081000	3088000	You're looking at the only thing that we looked at before we were even human.
3088000	3089000	Yeah.
3089000	3093000	Like it's built into our, you know, insects, like the reason we've talked
3093000	3096000	about that before, like the reason moths go around in sports lights is because
3096000	3100000	they're instinctively, they evolved with the moon in the sky and they use it as
3100000	3101000	a navigator.
3101000	3104000	They keep it on their left side to fly in a straight line and they get fucked by
3104000	3108000	porch lights and campfires because they think that's a moon and they spiral to
3108000	3109000	their death.
3109000	3115000	But for us, for the creators of mythology, there's this silver disc in the sky
3115000	3117000	that changes shape but is always up there.
3117000	3124000	It is synonymous in mythology with femininity, the egg that the sperm strive
3124000	3130000	for, this giant radiant thing up there, this cooling thing that has power over
3130000	3134000	the tide, this monthly lunar cycle.
3134000	3138000	It's like the most beautiful, like fuck the sun, it's garbage.
3138000	3142000	The sun will die one day and the moon is infinite.
3142000	3144000	The sun is murdering us.
3144000	3148000	Every morning it comes up, tries to kill us for 12 hours and goes back to sleep.
3148000	3151000	When the sun dies, we go first.
3151000	3154000	Well, I mean, I'm not saying the sun ain't got no power, but I'm just saying,
3154000	3159000	I refuse to negotiate with terrorists.
3159000	3164000	I know it's got its hand on the trigger, but it's like fuck you, spit in your face.
3164000	3167000	Like, you know, like we have this, you know, like whatever you think about
3167000	3169000	President Obama, I'm neither here nor there.
3169000	3172000	I don't want to give a shit, but like isn't this pickle about Syria?
3172000	3174000	I don't know why he thinks that we should go do this.
3174000	3177000	I think he was lied to. I think we're being lied to about it.
3177000	3180000	I think it's all a bunch of baloney. I think there's a bigger, weirder task at hand.
3180000	3182000	That's my theory.
3182000	3185000	The Pope is on that case too.
3185000	3189000	The Pope said something. I was just browsing around and I just see the headlines.
3189000	3192000	Like, I'm really out of the loop about the Syria thing, but I read a headline
3192000	3198000	that said like the Pope raises the question, is Syria happening so that we can sell weapons?
3198000	3200000	Is that what's going on?
3200000	3204000	Okay, I mean, yeah, he's making a better case for Catholicism than any Pope ever
3204000	3207000	because he likes like queers and stuff. He's awesome.
3207000	3209000	Or kind of. He kind of does.
3209000	3211000	I mean, as much as a Pope does.
3211000	3215000	I think he probably deep down does, but he knows what he can and can't say.
3215000	3221000	Has there been an apology from the, the thing that the Catholic Church needs to do is
3221000	3229000	there needs to be an acknowledgement, an apology about all of the covering of the, you know, the shenanigans.
3230000	3233000	That's a real thing that actually needs to happen.
3233000	3235000	Has that happened? I really don't know.
3235000	3240000	No, they can't. I mean, I'm sure they feel terrible about it.
3240000	3242000	Some of them do.
3242000	3245000	It's not the thought that counts in this particular case.
3245000	3247000	They really have to apologize.
3247000	3251000	What I was going to say, by the time this podcast drops tomorrow, maybe not,
3251000	3256000	that President Obama will be on every today show and morning news show
3256000	3261000	making a case with some strange ass shit that just seems really like, like a lot of malarkey.
3261000	3266000	No one knows what the, what the, you know, the logic behind this.
3266000	3271000	JFK, like he said, let's go to the fucking moon and let's do it in 10 years.
3271000	3273000	And I'll be dead when that happens. I'll be dead.
3273000	3276000	We did a couple of years by the time that goes down.
3276000	3279000	You know, he did. He actually did know that.
3279000	3282000	That's why he said it because he was awesome.
3282000	3285000	But they built the biggest machine humans are likely to ever make.
3285000	3288000	And they went to the moon and that's bad ass.
3288000	3290000	They lived in a magical, crazy time.
3290000	3294000	And our president, we had to go do it like I drew a red line.
3294000	3300000	We're going to do a tactical strike, a limited boots in the grounds.
3300000	3303000	And it's like, it's like, boom, fucking, let's go to Mars.
3303000	3305000	Let's do some fucking, let's do some cool human shit.
3305000	3309000	Yeah. The only thing that I, yeah, the only thing that I know about it is,
3309000	3312000	or think about it is like what I read a long time ago and I,
3312000	3316000	in my, in my little Chomsky book, which is just about, you know,
3316000	3320000	it's like the, the, it just feels like we, we,
3320000	3323000	America was this kind of brutal,
3323000	3326000	capitalistic genius before we went into World War II.
3326000	3329000	And we had this 50 year plan that we are now exiting.
3329000	3332000	We have now exited and we are,
3332000	3335000	we're trying to figure out a new 50 year plan.
3335000	3338000	Like America was whether you love it or hate it.
3338000	3340000	Like we're, we were good.
3341000	3345000	If you're going to be proud of something, be proud of how we fucking,
3345000	3346000	like we,
3346000	3349000	we made this decision that we were the Han Solo of the planet,
3349000	3352000	that we were, I got no love for the empire, but you know,
3352000	3354000	anywhere to make a book kind of like we were,
3354000	3358000	we hung back and we didn't believe in the force and we kept our blaster
3358000	3360000	on our side and we, we,
3360000	3362000	we had the Atlantic ocean between us and any trouble.
3362000	3364000	And we just like, we,
3364000	3366000	we just wanted to know what's in it for us.
3366000	3369000	And then we had this 50 year thing that started with our involvement in World
3369000	3372000	War II that turned out fine and dandy for us.
3372000	3373000	And, and,
3373000	3376000	and now we're living in the past, the finish line of all that.
3376000	3379000	And I think, you know, like we're there,
3379000	3382000	there were people were allowed to be more brutal back then.
3382000	3384000	They were allowed to be more secretive.
3384000	3386000	They were allowed to, you know, there were, there were,
3386000	3389000	there was a quarter of the population back then,
3389000	3391000	at least half, like,
3391000	3393000	like less people, plain and simple,
3393000	3397000	half as many problems and half as many ways to fuck up.
3397000	3400000	And, but it was like, now we're the, you know,
3400000	3402000	generation X is 40 and,
3402000	3405000	and the millennials are going, what are we doing?
3405000	3406000	And they have like,
3406000	3409000	like all of this communication with each other.
3409000	3410000	And it's just,
3410000	3412000	you can't just have a buzz cut and sit at your barbecue in the front yard
3412000	3415000	and go, let's get them Ruskies.
3415000	3417000	Like it doesn't, that works so well.
3417000	3419000	And we don't know how to get that back.
3419000	3424000	And we're trying really hard to get that business model operating by,
3424000	3425000	you know, it's like, okay,
3425000	3427000	it's like the Nielsen system going like,
3427000	3429000	now you're watching this, like this,
3429000	3431000	this Obama versus Putin shit.
3431000	3432000	Like, I'm not political.
3432000	3433000	I don't care about politics.
3433000	3436000	I'm not, I'm not, I'm not like, like, you know,
3436000	3438000	Greg Proops or someone that reads the papers all the time.
3438000	3439000	Like it's like,
3439000	3442000	it seems like we're just trying to really disingenuously trying to create
3442000	3445000	a cold war again, uh, where, you know, like that,
3445000	3446000	that we hate the Russians again.
3446000	3449000	Like nobody fucking cares about us anymore.
3449000	3450000	And nobody cares about Russia.
3450000	3453000	Like it's, it's so, it's so,
3453000	3455000	I feel so bad for everybody.
3455000	3457000	And like, like, I feel like if CNN,
3457000	3459000	I feel like if Wolf Blitzer,
3459000	3461000	because they get so fucking excited about war,
3461000	3463000	whenever there's a prospect of any kind of conflict,
3463000	3466000	I feel like Wolf Blitzer personally owned a boat and some missiles.
3466000	3468000	Syria would, Damascus would be done already.
3468000	3471000	Like he would have fucking gone over there himself and done it.
3471000	3474000	He'd be plugging one ear with his beautiful hair whipping in the wind.
3474000	3476000	I'm off the coast of Damascus right now.
3476000	3479000	And boy, it's lit up like 4th of July.
3479000	3482000	Also, Wolf Blitzer, I fucking,
3482000	3484000	he is, he's not smart.
3484000	3488000	He's not, he's, he seems kind of half retarded.
3488000	3490000	The guy, I, I'm talking loud.
3490000	3491000	And I do too.
3491000	3492000	I do too.
3492000	3493000	I do too.
3493000	3494000	But beep beep.
3494000	3496000	Like who fucking vetted this cock?
3496000	3497000	He's like,
3497000	3498000	Well, who vetted him?
3498000	3499000	Fucking, like why?
3499000	3501000	First of all, Wolf Blitzer, no.
3501000	3503000	Stupid name.
3503000	3505000	Wait, isn't there a name?
3505000	3506000	There's a chick on, uh,
3506000	3508000	CSMBC named Crystal Ball.
3508000	3510000	Uh, her name is Crystal Ball.
3510000	3512000	And she's a fucking journalist, which is awesome.
3512000	3515000	Because let's, let's, let's just call it a spade a spade.
3515000	3518000	Like, like really, like we gave up a long time ago.
3518000	3521000	But Wolf Blitzer needs to fucking stop talking
3521000	3524000	because he's a fucking douchey, douchey mccockadoodle douchebag.
3524000	3526000	Well, I don't even, yeah.
3526000	3528000	It's, it's gotten so bare bones that it's,
3528000	3530000	I don't even think it's treasonous anymore to say
3530000	3532000	that the curtain has dropped on the concept of state-run television.
3532000	3534000	You're just looking at people going.
3534000	3536000	It's almost like if there was a war
3536000	3537000	that networks would make more money
3537000	3539000	because we were watching more television and watching it.
3539000	3541000	And it seems like a lot of the networks are owned by companies
3541000	3542000	that make weapons.
3542000	3544000	We're, we're kicking that cynical about it.
3544000	3546000	But you don't have to be that cynical.
3546000	3548000	How you doing, by the way, Sikh?
3548000	3553000	Sikh, Sikh, what's your Syria plan?
3553000	3556000	Um, well, we're going to the moon so we don't have to worry about Syria.
3556000	3557000	I know.
3557000	3558000	Um, no.
3558000	3559000	We're not going to go to the moon before we,
3559000	3561000	before the Syria shit goes.
3561000	3562000	No, probably not.
3562000	3564000	Somebody, somebody yelled at me on Reddit for having this kind of,
3564000	3566000	like, like, we're, we're abandoning the world.
3566000	3568000	Are we needed down here and all that stuff?
3568000	3570000	I mean, it's, I don't know.
3570000	3572000	Cause the way I look at it is, uh, what,
3572000	3575000	I think what the world lacks the most of is pioneers.
3575000	3578000	And, uh, and that's why I put that dedication
3578000	3580000	at the beginning of Soulstar right when you open up.
3580000	3582000	It says dedicated to all pioneers.
3582000	3585000	And that's actually from an anime that I really love called Macross Plus,
3585000	3589000	which is about man that has passed earth.
3589000	3590000	They're, they're, they're out there.
3590000	3591000	We're out in the universe.
3591000	3592000	We're doing other things.
3592000	3595000	We're, we're creating machines and life on other planets.
3595000	3599000	And, uh, and I just see like right now we have pioneers in technology.
3599000	3602000	Like they're making the newest phone and they're making the newest thing we can
3602000	3604000	consume, but they're not taking us places.
3604000	3606000	They're not expanding us.
3606000	3608000	They're not evolving us really.
3608000	3610000	And that was one of my, that's on my list.
3610000	3611000	Did you hear me earlier?
3611000	3613000	I said, what, what has the species done?
3613000	3615000	I don't want, I'm not asking this in a cynical way.
3615000	3618000	I wanted to ask it in a like, like, because I'm very proud of our species.
3618000	3621000	I think obviously we have to be, what are we going to root for giraffes or,
3622000	3626000	I will say, I will say as someone who's been close to the, the, because that,
3626000	3630000	I, I loved hearing, uh, was it Beth last week?
3630000	3632000	Um, your, your neighbor?
3632000	3635000	It wasn't the week before, but I loved hearing her talk cause I think that's
3635000	3637000	what I was tweeting you too.
3637000	3641000	She was so close to saying what I've been saying for years,
3641000	3645000	but every time I say it freaks people out about what it's like when you're,
3645000	3648000	when you feel like you're gone from this plane, you would,
3648000	3650000	I'm very proud of humanity too,
3650000	3654000	because of I've seen what it's like to not be a part of it anymore.
3654000	3658000	So, you know, when people, when you have a bad day, just trust me,
3658000	3661000	it's, it's not as bad as you think it is.
3661000	3665000	I promise you because there is unbelievable things we can all do.
3665000	3667000	It's, it's, I'm really proud of the human race.
3667000	3669000	I just, I, I get this,
3669000	3672000	I get disillusioned sometimes when I see the crappy things we do,
3672000	3673000	but I'm, I'm 10 times,
3673000	3677000	I'm lifted 10 times higher when I see something amazing and positive.
3677000	3681000	The potential energy is so, it's gotten to the point where it's almost ludicrous
3681000	3686000	that we haven't kind of burst, but unfortunately our species history would seem to indicate
3686000	3687000	that it's going to get, you know,
3687000	3693000	it has to get worse before this like incredible like ray of light,
3693000	3695000	like shoots out by necessity.
3695000	3696000	Sure.
3696000	3698000	Like we're a species that is constantly, you know,
3698000	3701000	we, we, the first 90% of our history,
3701000	3703000	we're in God's crosshairs, you know,
3703000	3705000	we're just surviving ice ages and,
3705000	3709000	and bears were not something that you tucked your kids into bed with at night
3709000	3711000	and dogs were not something that fetched your slippers.
3711000	3712000	These were, these were,
3712000	3716000	these were equally intelligent animals as far as we were concerned.
3716000	3717000	They had everything we had.
3717000	3718000	We didn't have an alphabet yet.
3718000	3722000	And they were like, we were competing for lunch with them and half the time being lunch
3722000	3726000	and, and the triumphs that we have achieved in the face of that,
3726000	3728000	like we should be patting ourselves in the back.
3728000	3732000	Now we're in this most recent chapter where our species is going through this acne
3732000	3735000	and pubescent phase where there's a violence,
3735000	3739000	this hormonal oily explosions all over us.
3739000	3740000	We covered the earth.
3740000	3741000	We're choking it.
3741000	3743000	We're affecting it.
3743000	3747000	And we, we're like, we are, we have gotten to the point,
3747000	3750000	we were absolutely capable of turning everything around.
3750000	3755000	And the only thing standing in the way at this point is just this reluctance to do it.
3755000	3759000	We're just, because we, because how is it going to start?
3759000	3760000	What would anyone do?
3760000	3763000	How would, who's going to be the Rosa Parks of an entire planet?
3763000	3768000	Who's going to, who's going to stand under a, under a Bodhi tree this time and just go,
3768000	3771000	I'm not moving until shit gets real.
3771000	3776000	Like, like, and invite all of the, obviously that's a horrible example.
3776000	3778000	That's not what it's going to take.
3778000	3780000	Those are called hacky sackers.
3780000	3781000	They're not changing anything.
3781000	3784000	What, what, what can we do?
3784000	3790000	I mean, the answer is we have to take on this like crazy non marketable,
3790000	3793000	like Spock mentality where we start going like, okay,
3793000	3794000	we're going to do this thing.
3794000	3796000	And it's like, fuck it.
3796000	3797000	I don't know.
3797000	3798000	Whatever.
3798000	3801000	Like, like, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're very, we're very close.
3801000	3804000	But the thing is you have to, it's like, it's probably,
3804000	3807000	I imagine for you, like when you're writing, there's a,
3807000	3808000	there's a technique you have to do where you,
3808000	3811000	when you get to a certain point in whatever story you're telling,
3811000	3816000	where you have to literally break your brain to think in the shoes of that
3816000	3818000	character or that person or whatever.
3818000	3822000	I think there's a point where we just have to teach each other that technique,
3822000	3824000	how to break your brain and think differently,
3824000	3827000	even if it's just momentarily, because I think you, you,
3827000	3831000	you expand that way, you know, like you, you grow that way.
3831000	3832000	I mean, that's all of us go through that.
3832000	3834000	When we go through puberty, like you said,
3834000	3838000	like at this stage we're in like 13 to 17 and, and even past that,
3838000	3841000	I mean, I'm technically three years old.
3841000	3843000	You know, I learned words three years ago.
3843000	3847000	I learned writing three years ago and, and walking three, you know,
3847000	3848000	three years ago.
3848000	3850000	So it's like, it's, you know,
3850000	3852000	I'm constantly learning new things.
3852000	3854000	Like there's sometimes people see something I tweet and they're like,
3854000	3855000	Oh, that was kind of passive aggressive.
3855000	3857000	I'm like, I just learned what that was.
3857000	3859000	I thought it was aggressive.
3859000	3861000	I'm like, that's right.
3861000	3862000	And easy.
3862000	3863000	Yeah.
3863000	3868000	So it's a, you know, I, I'm constantly reconfiguring my brain because I
3868000	3869000	have to.
3869000	3873000	And I feel like, uh, that's what we should pass on to other people is to
3873000	3875000	get them to do that because it's not a permanent thing.
3875000	3877000	You don't have to crack it like an egg and it's done.
3877000	3879000	You know, you could put it back together.
3879000	3884000	Um, you know, it's almost like a transformer in a, in a reference way.
3884000	3886000	We have to become triple changers.
3886000	3887000	Exactly.
3888000	3893000	Uh, before this planet, uh, uh, becomes the first transformer movie and
3893000	3897000	kills off Optimus prime and tries to replace it with Rodimus prime.
3897000	3898000	What?
3898000	3899000	Oh boy.
3899000	3900000	Uh, all right.
3900000	3901000	Uh, uh, thank you.
3901000	3902000	Seek for coming by.
3902000	3904000	I always, uh, happy to hear from you.
3904000	3905000	Thank you, sir.
3905000	3906000	All right.
3906000	3907000	I don't know, Jeff.
3907000	3908000	What's up.
3908000	3909000	What's on the, what's on the list there?
3909000	3910000	There's some goodies on there.
3910000	3913000	Well, we've got to, I mean, well, one thing is like tonight I want to
3913000	3914000	a hundred percent commit to DND.
3914000	3915000	Now tell me what you think that means.
3915000	3916000	I go to you.
3916000	3917000	One hundred percent character immersion.
3917000	3918000	I've been listening to in there.
3918000	3921000	Hey, it's not a feral audio podcast, but you got to tip your hat to the
3921000	3922000	audience.
3922000	3923000	I don't know.
3923000	3924000	I don't know.
3924000	3925000	I don't know.
3925000	3926000	I don't know.
3926000	3927000	I don't know.
3927000	3928000	I don't know.
3928000	3929000	I don't know.
3929000	3930000	I don't know.
3930000	3931000	I don't know.
3931000	3932000	I don't know.
3932000	3933000	I don't know.
3933000	3934000	I don't know.
3935000	3936000	I don't know.
3936000	3938000	Take a picture of my last but got to tip your hat to the to the
3938000	3939000	enemy.
3939000	3940000	Sometimes.
3940000	3943000	But for those of you who are constantly readiting and tweeting and things
3943000	3947000	about your, uh, your dissatisfaction as DND purists about the level of DND
3948000	3950000	craftsmanship going out of the stage.
3950000	3952000	There are people out there that don't think we're playing this game
3953000	3954000	properly.
3955000	3957000	There are a couple of people who are not giving her all to,
3957000	3961000	there are a couple of people who are so enamored with our desire to bring DND
3961000	3965000	into the into the mainstream here that they are then they then feel betrayed
3965000	3966000	a little bit.
3966000	3971000	I think by our sloppy drunk and, uh, bad DND playing and a lot of love.
3971000	3972000	They want to see us do better.
3972000	3974000	They, they believe we can do better.
3974000	3975000	Oh, go look.
3975000	3976000	Yeah, that's certain.
3976000	3978000	For those of us, for those of you who'd feel that way to the point where you
3978000	3981000	wish you weren't listening, uh, to, to, to ours, I will say,
3981000	3985000	I've just started listening to Brian Possain's, uh, nerd poker podcast, uh,
3985000	3987000	which is not in front of a live audience.
3987000	3990000	It's literally just, uh, it's just Brian Possain and, and,
3990000	3994000	and Blink Apache and other friends, uh, playing, uh, DND for like an hour and a
3994000	3997000	half in the comfort of their own home.
3997000	4000000	And they've been playing for, they were friends that started playing 20 years
4000000	4005000	ago and they, they're playing very, very immersed DND and doing, doing, doing
4005000	4006000	great at it.
4007000	4009000	It's, it's, it's night and day from what we do here.
4010000	4011000	Here's what I would say.
4011000	4013000	I want to get, I want to ask Spencer.
4013000	4014000	Actually, Spencer, come on.
4014000	4016000	Let's bring Spencer up and talk about this.
4016000	4017000	Yeah.
4020000	4026000	Hello, Spencer.
4026000	4027000	What's up?
4027000	4028000	What's up?
4028000	4029000	What's up, you guys?
4029000	4030000	No, Spencer.
4030000	4031000	Okay.
4031000	4033000	Let's now, if Dan wants to talk about getting serious about this, because as
4033000	4036000	you know, Spencer, and I think everyone that plays with me now, I've become
4036000	4038000	overly immersed in DND.
4038000	4041000	I've become very like, like intensely involved and I love it.
4041000	4042000	Yeah.
4042000	4047000	But we play Pathfinder on Saturdays now with our private friendly group.
4047000	4050000	What we're playing right now is what, 3.5 DND?
4050000	4051000	On stage?
4051000	4052000	Yeah.
4052000	4053000	Yeah.
4053000	4056000	Now, I don't have that core rule book or the DND book on that one.
4056000	4058000	And so I've never taken my character sheet home.
4058000	4061000	So when I see my character sheet at the end of every Harmon town, I'm looking
4061000	4063000	at stuff for the first time every week.
4063000	4067000	I don't know what, I don't know what half of my spells are or, or, you know,
4067000	4068000	magical weapons do.
4068000	4070000	So like, and I can't look them up.
4070000	4073000	So maybe it's time for me to like email me a sheet.
4073000	4076000	I could look at it and I would come here more prepared and ready to rumble.
4076000	4077000	Yeah.
4077000	4078000	Well, that's fine.
4078000	4080000	We could do that.
4080000	4082000	All right.
4082000	4083000	Yeah.
4083000	4086000	So, so again, remember the reason Jeff doesn't want to do Spencer for
4086000	4089000	Halloween is because when, when it got mentioned, Spencer reacted
4089000	4090000	unenthusiastically.
4090000	4091000	Right.
4091000	4092000	Yeah.
4092000	4096000	Which is a great barometer to use for all decisions.
4096000	4098000	Hey, Spencer, should I fry an egg for breakfast tomorrow?
4098000	4100000	Go for it.
4102000	4104000	Or should I just kill myself?
4105000	4106000	Sure, man.
4108000	4110000	Best to use your own compass.
4110000	4112000	He's a great guy, but let's not chart our course.
4112000	4117000	I think Jeff did a great job of explaining kind of what my apprehensions
4117000	4118000	are.
4118000	4122000	I don't like, I think it'd be fine if everyone did it, but I think the
4122000	4125000	naked, like the con side of my head was thick and kind of the same stuff.
4125000	4129000	I understand the potential social ramifications and discomfort of
4129000	4132000	somebody going like, let's all dress like Tyler for Halloween.
4132000	4136000	And there's like a very fine line between that and everyone going, let's
4136000	4138000	all do our impression of Toby.
4140000	4142000	We all are going to get anxious about that.
4142000	4146000	And I would never like, like I obviously volunteer myself to be the
4146000	4149000	center of attention and come what may I take the good with the bad.
4149000	4153000	Other people, you know, it's like Spencer likes coming up here, but he
4153000	4156000	didn't sign up for being crucified publicly.
4156000	4158000	But so I get all that.
4158000	4161000	But I think I don't think a sea of people with beards from the
4161000	4165000	Hollywood toy store is going to like drive anyone to suicide.
4165000	4166000	No, me neither.
4166000	4169000	I think it won't work, but also if you're going to dress up like somebody
4169000	4173000	for me, because I'm a like a style junkie, I would want to do it right.
4173000	4177000	And I think it'd be hard to pull off a proper Spencer because beards and
4177000	4180000	wigs are usually shitty unless you spend zillions of dollars on them.
4180000	4183000	It would be very hard to pull off a proper Spencer beard.
4183000	4187000	So I think what I'd be doing was a pale caricature, which is doesn't do
4187000	4188000	anybody any justice.
4188000	4190000	And it's like, why bother?
4190000	4192000	This is just any friggin person.
4192000	4196000	Now, you're talking to a guy who went and bought a wig, a Tina Turner
4196000	4200000	wig online and took it to my hairstylist, sat down, put it on, and he cut it
4200000	4202000	and styled it to make my Jareth wig.
4202000	4208000	I mean, I mean, we I cut and colored that motherfucker and it looks.
4208000	4210000	But that's right.
4210000	4214000	But anyways, this is this was not Spencer's idea about the D&D full
4214000	4217000	immersion, nor was it my suggestion that we all do it or anything like that.
4217000	4221000	I was just making a kind of New Year's resolution, if you will, that I'm
4221000	4223000	going to try at least for tonight.
4223000	4227000	Like I want to really try to do it, be immersed in my character.
4227000	4228000	I'm all for it.
4228000	4230000	I say I say we all really just dive in.
4230000	4233000	I feel like it's something like wearing this pad around my neck, which is,
4233000	4235000	you know, it's an all or nothing deal.
4235000	4238000	Like, like, you know, I'm leaving the house and I'm like, do I really need
4238000	4241000	to wear this to to the bathroom or to the gas station?
4241000	4242000	Like, do you?
4242000	4244000	Well, the answer is, yeah, you have to.
4244000	4245000	It's all or nothing.
4245000	4246000	You were to the bathroom.
4246000	4247000	Well, I have to.
4247000	4251000	Otherwise, if you don't wear it all the time, then it's not it's not going to,
4251000	4253000	you know, if you can't, there's no way to go.
4253000	4256000	Like, I'm going to wear this pad because I think I'm entering a situation where
4256000	4258000	I'm going to think of something I might want to write down.
4258000	4260000	So obviously, I mean, I'm assuming you take it off to go to bed.
4260000	4261000	You take it off to go in the shower.
4261000	4262000	You're not wearing it for those things.
4262000	4264000	But you do have to shower.
4264000	4265000	What?
4265000	4266000	I don't shower.
4266000	4267000	Do you bath?
4267000	4268000	Do you bathe still?
4268000	4269000	Do you take your bathss or no?
4269000	4270000	Yeah.
4270000	4273000	A little more hesitant than last time.
4273000	4275000	I haven't been bathing like crazy.
4275000	4276000	Yeah.
4276000	4277000	You're in work mode now.
4277000	4278000	You're in Vietnam.
4278000	4279000	Yeah.
4279000	4281000	You're going to get like bad tattoos and stuff like that.
4281000	4282000	Yeah.
4282000	4285000	So you do remember in the morning, it's by the bed, by your keys and your phone.
4285000	4288000	You put it on and you say, OK, this is it.
4288000	4289000	And Spencer make me a tinier one.
4289000	4291000	It was the I Harmon Nano.
4291000	4294000	It was like the size of like a fortune cookie kind of.
4294000	4299000	But I lost that one.
4299000	4301000	But again, these are cheap.
4301000	4304000	It's not, you know, I think you're a better person.
4304000	4307000	There's a guy raising his hand that we've never seen before.
4307000	4308000	I don't think.
4308000	4309000	No, you probably haven't.
4309000	4310000	I saw you last night.
4310000	4311000	You weren't wearing it.
4311000	4312000	Oh, where were you?
4312000	4313000	I was at UCB.
4313000	4314000	All right.
4314000	4315000	No.
4315000	4316000	Look, I.
4316000	4317000	I.
4317000	4318000	This guy.
4318000	4321000	This guy fell on the audience is saying I saw you last night.
4321000	4323000	You weren't wearing it at UCB.
4323000	4325000	And I promised Erin in the green room.
4325000	4330000	I wouldn't throw her to this pack of hungry people like this.
4330000	4336000	I took it off before I went to UCB because I she saw me wearing it.
4336000	4338000	Getting ready to go to the UCB.
4338000	4344000	And by her she she I'm trying as hard as I can to be fair to her.
4344000	4349000	She was being protective of me and she was just flashing back to being the nerd
4349000	4353000	that she was and like trying to protect me knowing that I am a person that will
4353000	4357000	leave the house with like my pants tucked into my socks without knowing it
4357000	4362000	like I'm with like a cat on my head like she often needs to save me from the
4362000	4367000	public and and she she looked at the finger on my neck and she said you're
4367000	4371000	gonna you're gonna wear that to the whole you're gonna wear that out to the UCB
4371000	4376000	and everything huh and I was like yeah and then like she was like you know what
4376000	4379000	you know you're right you're right you're right you're right and but it was
4379000	4381000	the day I put it in my pocket and then it fell out somewhere.
4381000	4382000	All right.
4382000	4384000	I'm not a fraud sir.
4385000	4386000	That's right.
4386000	4389000	You're talking to my new friend Sandy and Amanda whom I met today.

4874320	4878280	pharyngeal myelitis it's like an autoimmune disease I really fucking know
4878280	4881720	and some doctors think there was an injury from my head dick I have Tourette's
4881720	4886120	so I've a tick where I snap my head back like that but I've had that tick since I
4886120	4890880	was the kid and so it was like kind of a gradual thing so we don't really know I
4891080	4895600	what is your name Andrew Andrew is it theoretically possible that you could
4895600	4900760	injure yourself from from just like well it wasn't like a one-time thing like
4900760	4904120	I've been doing it since I was a kid but when at the time I had my injury I was
4904120	4908920	doing it you know 10 to 15 times in a row but a lot you know more violently
4908920	4912720	take medication for the Tourette's I've been on pretty much every medication for
4912720	4918040	it and haven't really had anything more you know and they wax and lean on their
4918040	4924160	own Andrew at risk of making Dan very jealous your shirt Andrew is wearing a
4924160	4928560	shirt with cats all over it cats I didn't know that there was like a like
4928560	4935160	a like a specific image that would turn me on on a man's shirt but that is if I

5437080	5443600	we're not being very I am also going to fully immerse okay we're all gonna fully
5443600	5446960	immerse Andrew doesn't have to because he doesn't I mean yeah you can constantly
5446960	5451880	ask what the hell am I doing okay I probably will yeah you're fine but it's
5451880	5456480	basically it's it's it's it's it's it's it's storytelling Spencer's the
5456480	5461080	dungeon master he's telling a story and we're all participants in it and it's
5461080	5465680	sort of like if we're in combat we'll all take turns and he'll ask you what
5465680	5468440	you're doing and you're gonna look at your possessions list and you're gonna
5468440	5473840	make things out of them so like think of how you can combine them don't listen to

5503360	5510760	yeah no I've never I don't eat a lot in bed I don't I think Dan and I eat more
5510760	5522900	than let's begin this shall we yeah Jeff just eats pussy
5526920	5534320	Ryan Gosling traveling down a road I just got a woman who doesn't want to be
5534320	5543280	with him when last met our heroes had just laid low a mighty snowflake deep
5543280	5548480	within the dungeons of admiral dark stars black key after patching up their
5548480	5552720	wounds and ascending stairs they entered a large room with giant buttons on the
5552720	5560680	walls and a giant porcupine on the floor they began fighting they still are all
5560680	5566440	right that's all that happened yeah all right so the porcupine is still alive
5566440	5571960	yeah we cut it up pretty good last time yeah you were pretty far but you know
5571960	5578520	not quite yeah by the way someone someone on the subreddit suggested you
5578520	5582680	know announcing what are our hit points are at the at the beginning of each
5582680	5586960	session because I know I lose track yeah cuz I don't have a pencil up here when I
5586960	5590480	play when I play privately I'm able to keep track of my own hit points but yeah
5590480	5597160	I don't know where I am I don't know how close yeah shut up but I'm not gonna
5597160	5603880	write up my character sheet with a pen I don't what do you like life coach Adam
5603880	5606600	Goldberg is just he's popping like popcorn tonight what does your hit
5606600	5611280	point say right for a month make Adam Goldberg like like Tyler was raising
5611280	5614680	his hands is excited about Grand Theft Auto and then I was like heckling Tyler
5614680	5617760	that's what I got frustrated it's like shut up you're both you're like don't
5617760	5626000	maybe come back there this is out of hand you're my favorite I'm saying but
5626000	5629320	you're all my children and you look like the collection of it was pissing me off
5629320	5631960	like you're raising your hand like I want to talk about Grand Theft Auto and
5631960	5634960	then he's like let it go don't do anymore and you're like he's throwing
5634960	5639280	peas at me and I'm like I'm taking you both in a Grand Canyon I'm gonna throw
5639280	5648080	you in Dan total immersion than your character no tangents maybe as our
5648080	5653680	characters we should say how we're feeling just to emerge all right I
5653680	5659920	Krista Berg Andrew yeah I as a gnome barbarian and it's still in a fight with
5659920	5663240	a giant porcupine monster I'm feeling like we should still continue to kick
5663240	5668560	this porcupine monsters ass and move forward yeah porcupine monster all
5668560	5675360	right what's going on I'll put it at Jeff's turn I take out my my flaming
5675360	5681000	sword and attack the straight at his neck attacking straight at his neck with
5681000	5686600	your flaming sword your strike connects with his necks the burning sword cuts
5686600	5691840	into his flesh and goes about a foot and a half deep it severs pretty heftily I'd
5691840	5704080	say dealing 17 damage you see blood kind of pour out of his throat and he
5704080	5710360	falls down on the floor you see Andrew is that easy it's that easy so are we
5710360	5714000	are we just going after the porcupines well he's dead now we got him yeah okay
5714000	5717760	so now it's just but now there I think there are there's still some big weird
5717760	5722080	stone buttons on the walls yeah so before you you see a door it's a big
5722080	5726480	orange door on either side of this door you see three large round buttons
5726480	5731000	they're probably each about four feet wide circular buttons on this wall
5731000	5737640	there's also a hole in the ceiling from which comes a long copper pendulum it's
5737640	5741240	just hanging down there it's in front of the buttons or where is it in
5741240	5744520	relationship to them it's in front of the door so it's kind of like in the
5744520	5749160	direct middle of this room can it reach the buttons if you were to hit it if you
5749160	5752480	were to hit the pendulum you could hit the pendulum or you could hit the buttons
5752480	5756280	but what if you hit the pendulum what it's could it swing and hit a button I
5756280	5766760	mean it would probably go too high I guess he's immersed he's good I just
5766760	5772400	I'm glad I was here the day that Aaron fell in love with you I mean I just
5772400	5779840	wanted to be happy I go up and examine the buttons to see if there's any
5779840	5784840	markings or runes or anything upon them there are not they're just rather slick
5784840	5791600	shiny buttons hmm there's four of us and there's four buttons there's six buttons
5791600	5798000	there's so oops there's six of us yeah that's four of us and six but all right
5798000	5802160	there's a door there's four buttons there's six buttons there's six buttons
5802160	5809520	anybody in the crowd have any three on either side of the door yeah Sandy what
5809520	5827120	were you gonna say okay I tear apart my sack and I tie it using my tie use my
5827120	5834160	rope to tie it to my water skins and create a shield in front of the buttons
5834160	5841560	so we can stand behind this water skin that role she'll I'm just gonna touch
5841560	5847040	the left most button and see what happens but I'm standing behind that
5847040	5856720	shield just in case your shield what is it it's like a fort like a living room
5856720	5861480	fort to water skins does not make a fort a forts not a shield it doesn't make a
5861480	5868760	shield I love you Spencer you have rope I think why would you rip up a sack to
5868760	5876240	tie stuff well the rope is stringing it out like like beef jerky you form a
5876240	5887360	shield you sold me you sold me okay sorry no okay so you're holding this out
5887360	5892560	these two water skins yeah you're just I'm immersed in my character you're the
5892560	5897120	character of a homeless person thinks that the government's trying to read
5897120	5904920	their mind I go up and examine the pendulum is there anything on the pendulum
5904920	5908680	how's it attached to the ceiling it goes up into this hole in the ceiling
5908680	5913480	it's a rather big hole maybe about can you six feet around can you see what's
5913480	5919240	if you look up can you see what's blackness but we know what the whole
5919240	5924080	quarter goes up like a black hole okay maybe crawl up that that that that that
5924080	5927200	rope the sense the holes big enough that you could find out what's up there I
5927200	5930520	want to I want to try to press the leftmost button I'm gonna stand back
5930520	5934400	while you do that I'm afraid I stand behind my shield I look at your shield
5934400	5942000	and go Wow you press the leftmost button and you hear a rumbling sound
5942000	5949880	from overhead oops I say sorry shouldn't have had that whatever we had this is
5949880	5955720	your full character of mercy yeah I'm looking forward to that starting by the
5955720	5967440	way shit what's that rumbling there we go yeah so you you look up to see lava
5967440	5974240	pouring out of this hole in the ceiling it's getting hot in here blub blub blub
5974240	5981480	blub blub and I just want to sound effect Kristen Brooke are you okay yeah
5982240	5986640	are you doing lava sound yeah I think I'd be better to doing sound effects
5986640	5991720	all right follow your heart you're a songwriter you wrote the lady in red the
5991720	5994640	one that one of the ladies so lava is coming down around the pendulum yeah
5994640	5998600	pours down this hole not around the pendulum but from that same hole and it
5998600	6002360	pours down and starts to pull it's pulling up around the floor you have to
6002360	6009080	move away from it okay can I I see that I have a new tree token where are we
6009720	6016680	skills that we're looking at is that already getting these oh I didn't look
6016680	6021640	at this other paper I pressed I pressed the second leftmost button okay so none
6021640	6026280	of you want to like move out of the lava floor because I said you'd have to and
6026280	6032880	then I I've repositioned as far away from the lavas I can perfect I also I
6032880	6038920	pack up my shield and I also do about wait I have a climbing kid can we can
6038920	6044520	we climb the pendulum you can try yeah yeah let's climb that and see what's up
6044520	6048720	there all right so you you try to cram what scramble up this pendulum and as
6048720	6052720	you pull it you feel it it kind of gives like it goes chunk and falls down a
6052720	6057400	little bit and as it falls down a little bit you hear another rumbling sound
6057400	6062440	coming from this hole and it also sounds like the grinding of metal plates
6062440	6068600	yeah it sounds ominous is there lava near the buttons can we get to the
6068600	6072280	button safely without being in lava at this point you guys are on one side like
6072280	6077480	you're between the lava and the buttons so like if the how fast is the lava
6077480	6080520	moving towards us it's not moving towards you anymore because you moved
6080520	6085440	out of the way in fact it's starting to drain down this drain in the floor so I
6085440	6090480	guess you guys moved out of the way I hop over the lava well you already okay
6090480	6093680	so oh but I'm already close to that yeah if you want to go to the other side
6093680	6100000	but you're okay all right I hit another button okay well I put let's keep track
6100000	6104380	of it did I hit the second button not yet I was still doing is climbing so the
6104380	6109480	grinding sound continues and then you hear a chunk chunk chunk like falling
6109480	6114240	boulders coming from above above this hole and you're still dangling on this
6114240	6121320	essentially a rope under this hole yeah I have another question I don't know if
6121320	6133520	this could help us here I it says I'm an escape artist can we escape from here do
6133520	6139240	you have do you have disabled device under skills yeah yeah could he could he
6139240	6142480	try to disable device or use perception on the door and didn't figure out how to
6142480	6148960	open it yeah I mean definitely let's disable the device then okay so you get
6148960	6152440	off this pendulum thing to go over to the door which is the device you're
6152440	6157720	disabling I'm assuming so so you go over to this door and you're checking it out
6157720	6163880	and this grinding continues and then a giant giant block of ice crashes down
6163880	6174160	where this pendulum was from the hole in the ceiling you don't you you don't
6174160	6180200	find a way to unlock this door however so did he was that was that a trap that
6180200	6183880	was meant to kill somebody there beneath it or what all I'm saying is that he
6183880	6188320	pulled on this thing and then a giant cube of ice fell down push the button
6188320	6200600	pulled a chain you will experience an icy rain I press the third button if a
6200600	6206480	chocolate choo-choo train comes out we'll know that Spencer writes us during
6206480	6211320	the show yeah well as you press the button you hear it sounds like a
6211320	6217400	squelching sound and thick black tar oozes from this hole in the ceiling
6217400	6227600	chocolate choo-choo train we've got to figure out how to fill this room with
6227600	6234680	milk and lemonade we're gonna die is there something we could tie a hundred
6234680	6239480	hundred fifty foot rope to and climb out or you can try and climb up out of that
6239480	6243080	hole in the ceiling but you wouldn't need the rope oh the list must use the
6243080	6248720	rope okay so one button made lava one button made ice one button made black
6248720	6253840	tar there's one button left one of these is gonna be three left three more it's
6253840	6265480	gonna be milk lemonade out of the hole fudges made I go push one of the other
6265560	6272600	fourth button fourth button fourth button yeah you just hear a bubbling
6272600	6277680	sound and purple mist pours into the room out of the ceiling hole positive
6277680	6284200	purple mist he seemed a little bummed out yeah yeah I mean it's not as negative
6284200	6291960	as it could have been cool party atmosphere or is it is it scary is it
6291960	6295920	taking this feel-good purple mist or we know is it gonna hurt us purple mist
6295920	6300520	it's like definitely caustic and burning your throat and tearing at your eyes and
6300520	6305320	okay so it's bad purple mist yeah not the kind of purple mist one thing's for
6305320	6309240	sure I'm pushing all these buttons before we die I'm not gonna go to my
6309240	6313080	my death going like what about the six button yeah we gotta figure it out what
6313080	6318720	do you think the point of the pendulum is pendulum is here my character that has
6318720	6323480	oh shit I have 19 intelligence yeah use it I guess I would have been smarter
6323480	6330480	than I just thought that I have nine but you know my 19 I just tried just for
6330480	6334040	just cuz I'm curious I swing I swing the pendulum to see what happens if I move
6334040	6337120	the pendulum from side to side you push the pendulum and it kind of goes a
6337120	6340400	little bit before coming back to equilibrium and stopping but then the
6340400	6344400	grinding noise starts and you see another chunk of ice fall through the
6344400	6349680	ceiling it's a big block cube of ice and chunk and we can climb that ice out
6349680	6353280	of here yeah like the ice and the lava got something to do with each other well
6353280	6356280	how does that is the ice hitting the lava landing in lava well at this point
6356280	6360680	all the lava is drained out there sticky tar covering the floor but uh and the
6360680	6364640	first button made lava come down yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna push another button
6364640	6372640	which one the fifth button the fifth button you push the fifth button and a
6372800	6377800	steady stream of fizzling brown fluid comes from the whole of the ceiling
6377800	6383800	first of all it's not even right around the corner fudge is yeah I well I mean
6383800	6391040	like a root beer yeah a fizzling brown liquid comes out yeah and what's it
6391040	6398160	what's it what's its properties what's it what's it I don't know is it hot is
6398160	6402200	it cold do you want to interact with it as a character I want to smell it you
6402200	6412040	smell it and you smell 23 cents street value different different sense oh
6412040	6420680	sharpie should be a small year I I take I take my pinky finger and I I put it in
6420680	6425040	the brown fizzing liquid it's a bit tingling on your finger like good
6425640	6435880	yeah yeah like friendly oh I jump in it I roll around and I laugh I laugh it's
6435880	6442740	delight I put my finger in and I taste it it tastes like the 23 flavors of
6442740	6453040	dr. pepper that's right dr. pepper now comes in diet wait a minute the fifth
6453040	6458400	button dispenses dr. pepper okay I said I'd immerse myself in character but not
6458400	6463920	when I smell a payola scandal happening Spencer who have you been talking to and

6484240	6492240	it just became a funny detour I take off my shirt and and while I take it off I
6492240	6495920	imagine that I'm a sexy construction worker and there's girls going by like

6517160	6520960	all right I jump on the pendulum grab the grab the rope and then jump off and
6520960	6524480	see if an ice block falls down a third ice block falls down on top of the other
6524480	6529080	one yeah are they stacking up can we know because okay so like the one hit it I
6529200	6533400	should explain this at the time what am I thinking the first one hit it off
6533400	6536880	center and that toppled and then he kind of slid apart and then the third one went
6536880	6541680	between them so now there's kind of like three ice blocks on roughly even floor I
6541680	6546400	try to climb out of the hole the hole in the ceiling it's about 30 feet higher
