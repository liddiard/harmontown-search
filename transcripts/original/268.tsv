43280	45280	What you got in that sack
45800	51400	Just some games and a shit to get back on the truth that you're going to roll some dice
51720	54720	It's true, man. It's true. I got head lice
55520	57860	That's a parasite on your head
60000	63760	You should see a doctor. Let's bring up your mayor Dan Harmon
67720	73880	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
74400	81000	The beat rolls through me. I'm an artist. I'm a poet. I fucked your mama and she didn't even know it
81000	83000	I'm a stealth fucker. I
83160	87440	Roll in got bad luck or something when I go in
87680	90880	I got a tiny little wiener so she didn't know
91960	94560	It's like a cave hear me blow
95320	97320	Yo echo
97760	100480	It's not your mama's pussy. That's the problem
101680	103780	boy, oh boy, you guys threw me cuz
105480	109120	No, no, no, that sounded accusatory that sounded shameful
110000	116720	Shameful, I'm just saying the rap is more painful than it would have been if I hadn't been overshadowed by
117360	119360	professional rappers
121760	123760	Rachel Maddow
125200	128760	Yeah, do it do a rap as Rachel Maddow, all right
130440	138920	Yeah, yo, yo, yo, yo, I got a long neck and my head's in the stars
140080	143000	Rachel Maddow coming at you tonight. I got some
143560	149080	Left leaning news to make you feel all right in spite of Nazis taking over the USA
150120	154800	I'm popular not because I'm gay. It's just the reason you can trust me
156720	159040	Don't fuck with me. I got a
160240	162240	Really long neck
162360	165680	So I can see better than you what's going on
168320	170320	Rachel Maddow
170360	172820	Haven't watched her in a while. Wait, okay
173840	175440	kill Zach
175440	181320	Zach McKeever on did I just out Rachel Maddow? Well, you certainly added her as having a long neck
181440	184120	No, people know that and she like she celebrates it
184120	189680	I think with her if you were ashamed of your very long neck you would not wear what Rachel Maddow wears
189680	196040	This is not me objectifying her. I think you're certainly neck shaming. I think he's next celebrating
196040	199560	I'm like like I believe she is I'm next celebrating
200680	206880	now if somebody now somebody now we've learned from her what the next thing that happens is that Rachel is doing a
207480	213080	AMA and somebody says Dan Harmon says you have a shamefully long neck and that you dress like you know
214000	216680	What are your comments on that and then we're beefing? Oh
217360	219880	Well now we're beefing beefing with Maddow
222280	224620	We're in a reservoir dogs crossfire with
226360	228360	Ron Jeremy and Rachel Maddow
230960	234080	Anyways, that's the danger of opening your show with rapping
234080	239160	But I've found that that opening the show with a little freestyle. It gets my
240280	242280	energy up
242880	245440	Would be the sound of like thunderous applause
247640	251700	Hey, do you have a burp in the chamber right now that can you do a word burp?
252880	254880	Yes
255400	257400	There goes
258440	262920	And we try to get Steve AG to do a thing where he just burps words and
263600	265680	it's hard to do like
266640	272320	multi-syllabic word burps and one burp I want it if you can pull this off
272760	277080	You'll be my hero if you can word burp White House aides. I
278520	280520	Have to swallow air
284880	286880	White House
289000	292840	Aids had a little bit of vomit drop coming up on it
293640	297920	Yes, why haven't done that in a while just once can someone burp women's rights
300000	302000	Try to burp women's rights
304320	309640	How have you guys been we had a Thanksgiving weekend, what did you guys do let's start with Spencer I went to Dino's
310520	317280	Yeah, it was good. I I wanted to like make a recipe to bring there, but then I decided to just bring coke
318080	320080	not like the drug like
320600	325160	The drink and it went over really well people are like man
325160	326640	I love this party
326640	333160	But the only thing to drink is hard liquor and wine and then I was like I got you and then people were digging
333160	337480	It and I was like, yeah, this is the right move. He he made a lot of good food. It was good
337640	343200	It was there wasn't a lot of crazy people there, which there are occasionally so it was a real fun time
343200	345760	What do you feel about his garlic levels as a chef?
346920	353400	They're high, but that's what I like. I'd say the garlic levels in the Thanksgiving dinner were lower than normal
353400	358480	There's usually Dino usually makes like Greek food to go with like the Thanksgiving food
358480	362960	so like he'll make a turkey and then he'll make like some crazy beef stew stuff and
363480	365040	He didn't really have any of that
365040	372000	It was just traditional Thanksgiving stuff, which I was thankful for. I mean, I you know, I like Greek food, but thanksgiving. Yeah
373240	376560	Yeah for me, huh? Yeah, let's go to you. Oh me
376560	382760	I went to Florida with Cody and visited with my parents, which is I haven't been down to Florida
383120	387720	In a long time to visit the parents and we our main activity was Balderdash
389040	393760	Which is like it's a it's we've my family is like
394360	400120	We we walk a razor's edge as a tribe like we're not we're we don't have
402320	409060	Unconditional love like love love love is in the Harmon family as a it's a loose knit alliance of
409760	412380	nefarious bounty hunters who are all
413080	415080	just trying to make sure that
415840	420300	that that the galaxy doesn't doesn't get plunged into war but
421260	428140	It's and so if you break out monopoly or trivial pursuit your you could be asking for trouble
428140	432620	How big how big was the squad? It was you and Cody and just the four of us really? Yeah, and
433900	439860	But Balderdash I've found for my family is this just amazing. It's it's every man for himself
440220	444500	No, you know, that's an outdated expression. Sorry two of them were women that were out for themselves
446260	448260	Ladies be out for yourselves
448660	451980	Don't thank God. They finally got that message from someone they could trust
453300	458420	The ball, but Balderdash is like there's no teams and there's also
459420	465820	Any any time pressure is self-imposed. We decided after a while. Let's let's take no longer than two minutes to write an answer
466420	473420	Refresh my memory. Balderdash is what you you you lie about a thing. You have to figure out who's who's who's telling the truth
473940	479860	To give you one real definition or you got it. There's there's a word and you have to guess the definition
479860	483340	Well, I think I can I can just knowing what Jeff knows. I think I can explain it
484300	489100	Fast to him by saying it's basically the Leonard Malton movie guide game, right?
489100	494380	But there's five more categories than movies right and you can just the way we play it
494380	497220	You can just pick move. It could be a definition of a word, right?
497380	500460	So there's acronyms like so just be a jumble of letters
500500	504660	That's my least favorite one because I feel like I'm doing homework. I just feel like I'm not
505300	507420	You know, it's not about creativity. It's just like I
509220	514380	Hc and then you're the people just write International Housing Committee of
515420	517420	You know, I hate
518100	519500	harp
519500	523700	Yeah, it and then the cool thing of the genius of balderdash
524340	526540	As far as the actual publishers of the game
526740	530020	But what they really did write in my opinion is they clearly
531460	535260	They there's real answers. There's one real answer on the
535860	540480	You know, I HC does stand for something in the real world out there somewhere
542740	549620	But also there's all these movies that no one's ever seen so the the title will be like blue
551820	553980	Blue marble babies and
554660	560620	Like there's some movie out there called blue marble babies, you don't know if it's like Dollywood or
561780	563780	Bollywood
564620	568020	Started to greenlight more projects this fiscal quarter
568580	572780	We're pulling for Dollywood there. I don't know if they're gonna catch up to Bollywood but the
574100	578580	You don't know where it's from. You just know that there is a movie out there called the blue marble babies
579260	586100	The the genius of the balderdash publishers is that whoever they had write the real answer
586620	588380	which might be
588380	592180	it's it's it's a it's a log line for the movie blue marble babies and
592780	597060	then they have the people that write them they write them in kind of a thick like a
599460	601460	Fuck
601540	603540	Trap
604500	607260	Rob Chavez here. Yeah, I let him in
614100	617140	Hello Rob happy Thanksgiving Rob
620860	623860	Thank you, there's no camera over here, right
626460	631660	No, there's not you don't want you don't want to disrupt there's no this isn't about you
633540	636460	I was looking though. Maybe you
637060	640940	We were trying to find the balderdash game so we could play it live on stage
640940	642940	I thought it was something that we I
643300	646980	We could do a round tonight to test it, but I really actually think I'd be really okay
646980	653700	I think that Benson basically plays the London Bolton movie game on his movie podcast getting Doug. Nope
653940	660260	No, that plays it like Douglas movies Doug. Okay. Sorry. I got it mixed up. It doesn't matter. It's a different podcast network
660300	666620	We don't care if they live or die and to tell you the truth if it was a choice between them dying and us
667540	671380	saving some bread for I don't know Cameron Esposito or
672100	678420	One of our one of our tribe like what are we boys, you know, it's killer be killed in the podcast wars
678660	685360	Yeah valuable Warby Parker dollars are being about battled over. So Dan it was you Cody your mom and your dad
685820	688260	stuck and the the confines of
689060	692580	Florida yeah, and how'd it go? It was great. It was really great
692580	697860	Oh and my parents have a little tiny electric boat that they they live in a neighborhood of
701500	707540	Yeah, my parents moved or Wisconsinites that moved to Florida that was that's all that's the dream of every Wisconsinite
707580	710500	You don't go to California because California has
711140	712700	drugs
712700	717460	Foreign people and is going to fall into the sea. That's so you go to Florida
719220	720420	a
720420	723140	drug-free all-american
724020	726020	totally globally
726020	727460	shielded
727460	729460	absolutely no natural disasters
730020	731540	imminent
731540	738540	Said that but it's all about boat culture there. My parents moved into a little neighborhood. It's kind of you know upper middle-class
739260	741260	retirement suburb
741260	742420	with
742420	744420	Although I don't know if that's true anymore
745380	748100	So save your flame wars
749940	752340	When you fact-check this but there's like canals
752940	754900	There's neighborhoods of Florida
754900	761620	Where everyone has a canal in their backyard instead of like an alley where you'd have like an alley because you're a dirty urban
762460	763580	horrible
763580	764940	breakdancer
764940	770540	You have you have streets. I've been accused of that before the then and then the non-addressed facing
770980	772980	Conduit is an alley
773460	775620	How do only instead of crack pipes? There's manatee
776220	783420	How do we play balderdash live right now? We would we would have to we would have to find a balderdash a set of cards
783420	787820	probably just any any any any card from any
788580	791100	balderdash or just like a movie title if
792020	795500	You at home have one take a picture of it and send it to
796220	800300	Harman town to what we can play it. We'll play it with our guest when he when he's like like
800300	805380	Yeah, we can try to figure it out. Let's let's let's make an action item. Okay, if somebody out there
806380	808380	in our crowdsourcing community
808380	815140	can isolate let's say a balderdash card so that such so that we can see a
816380	821660	Question side and an answer side for only we can see it, but the crowd can't see it. No the crowd can see it
821660	824180	Oh, we won't be able to see it. I got you
824500	829860	So if someone I would say let's just make that an action item and then maybe our crew can if somebody like
832220	834780	Cuz otherwise I'll just be talking about it all night. Well, okay
834980	840260	Let's put that out into the ether. But how did you get along with your mom and dad? How did that all go down?
840260	844060	Was it healing? I wouldn't say it was healing but I would say it was triumphant
844060	850380	We didn't really fight that much like I had one flare-up with my mom at a restaurant dinner and then I I
851260	853020	like
853020	859180	steamed and you know stood and like I didn't we kind of that that night got
859460	863940	Lost like we didn't we like went to dinner and then following that dinner
863940	870660	I went back to the hotel and I just kind of fumed into a drink at the hotel bar and had Cody, you know
871100	873100	there as my
873340	877260	Partner, but like she wasn't like taking sides or anything. It was just like I needed I needed space
877260	884300	I needed time and then the next morning. It's fine, you know, let's go who wants to keep fighting. Nobody does Cody enjoy
885220	890140	Your parents like yeah, she loves them and vice versa. She's yeah, she thinks they're great
890180	895620	she comes from a family or it's like Cody Cody has a childhood memory of
897060	903860	That her thing that her mom would do regularly when Cody would take a bath her mom Randy Heller
904540	906580	Mama LaRusso from the karate kid
907260	909260	So it's not why she's a valuable mother at all
909780	915060	But it arguably gets in the way of love to have a professional actor as a mother
915060	919180	It doesn't hurt to know that your mom was in karate kid doesn't hurt me
919180	922980	I mean I have become functionally a step karate kid
924380	929060	You don't you don't make no mistake about it. This is part of the package for me. I
930260	934140	Didn't learn unconditional love I'm motivated by other things. I love Cody
935020	939060	Part of what I love about Cody is that I get to be a step karate kid. Anyway
940060	947500	But no, she was also Rizzo on Broadway and in Greece, wasn't she? Yeah, she was also I didn't hurt her
947500	954500	She was most people recognize her on the street when that happens as her character that she played a madman. She was
954980	956860	Don Draper's
956860	958860	secretary for a season
959860	965420	Where the show isn't about fucking Randy Heller. All right, it could be she's got enough attention
967260	972860	But but what she was also a loving mother and what she would do like Cody has this like it's not even a story
972860	975860	It's not an anecdote. It's a tradition that her mom had with Cody
975860	978260	Cody would take a bath and then after the bath was done
978300	982580	Cody would get out of the bath and mom would would wrap her up in a big
983580	991620	Towel and then wrap her up in a big blanket like a comforter and then her and her mom would start dragging her
991780	993140	around the house
993140	995140	in inside the comforter
996460	1000180	Saying I got a wild fish here. I got a wild fish and
1001220	1005280	She would do this elaborate like radio play for baby Cody
1005860	1011620	Who was like just cocooned in this comforter being dragged around hardwood floors
1012100	1014100	around an apartment and
1014100	1015620	while her mom
1015620	1023420	Pretended that she was passing various checkpoints and lying about whether she had a wild fish with her. So she would do different voices
1024380	1026380	No, sir. I don't have any
1026820	1029900	wildlife or agriculture in my comforter
1029900	1034500	I just just just a bag and like trying to keep her quiet keep her from giggling
1035060	1039780	Yeah, I look this isn't about let's bag on the Harman's. This is about contrast
1040740	1044960	My memories are the water would get cold after a while and I would find my way out
1046140	1048140	Go rolling pine needles. All right
1052500	1055940	So what age did I stop bathing no
1057900	1064240	I don't know. How when was my first bath? So what age did Cody's mom do the wild fish thing like 15?
1065200	1067200	27 yeah
1068080	1072280	We did it together. She had it was like a passing of the baton. I don't know
1072280	1076600	I don't know that answer you and your mom and your dad didn't have any kind of heritage like that
1076600	1080960	Like you didn't have special little fun games. Mmm. I
1082160	1084160	can't I
1084480	1089320	Rob Sharp just yelled out Tiki, which was a nickname then I had Tiki. Yeah
1090200	1095120	Why Tiki it was a favorite childhood story of mine Tiki Tiki Timbo. Oh
1096040	1103360	Man, God damn it. We heard about that on whiting Wong's the Thanksgiving special. Oh, yeah, which you can check out on iTunes
1103560	1105560	Yeah, I feel like
1105600	1108600	We should bring Rob Shriver up on stage right now
1109520	1115760	well, we also have an important guest it's been a long time coming because remember since the election my goal has been to
1116640	1119480	Because I don't know what I'm doing and I have a forum
1120240	1128160	and I I immediately had reactions that were both predictable unhelpful and ultimately unguiding I
1129000	1131680	got mad that everybody and
1132240	1133920	bought a gun and
1133920	1139380	Have since basically been trying to focus on quitting all my jobs and building a bat cave
1139840	1143000	with a crossbow aimed at the door, but I
1144000	1149600	In the meantime, I've wanted to use my platform if I could to like signal boost the the whole spectrum
1150320	1155120	You know the only thing step I've taken was we had we flew Gotham girl
1155840	1160640	Out from from New York and she I think I don't know if she would want to be called
1160640	1164640	I don't know what label she'd want to be called. She calls herself an Eleanor Democrat in her bio
1164800	1166800	She talked about you know
1167320	1173080	As a you know, it's important. It was important to hear from an intelligent person's
1173840	1178840	Perspective like basically don't give up on on what we would call the old Democratic Party
1178840	1185000	You know, let's hack it the way that the the the Nazis have hacked the right wing the the Republican Party
1185000	1191480	I mean they they infiltrated it took it over and now the word Republican means I want to win
1192440	1196480	It didn't mean much before that but it's like and I think the idea is like come on
1196480	1200140	We can make the demo we can still use this shell of a Democratic Party
1200320	1204600	Hack it drive it from the inside because it has the numbers and the system
1205000	1209040	Systemic advantage that it can it's the only thing that can rock and sock them that robot
1210000	1213240	So now let's hear maybe I would assume maybe another perspective
1213240	1219040	But I want to I want to definitely be clear that this we wanted to have somebody from the DSA on the Democratic Socialists
1219640	1221160	America and
1221160	1227960	But we this is a guy who's a member of them. He's not a he doesn't represent them as a leader or anything
1227960	1235560	He's not a spokesman. He's already we'll talk about how he's already he resigned from his position as an official spokesman because of a little
1235880	1237880	like a little
1239040	1246480	Gridlock little cultural gridlock comedic cultural gridlock that happened where he did the smart thing and like backed out as being a representative
1246480	1252880	So but what he is is a guy who understands that perspective which I think is different from the other one that we've gotten and we tried
1252880	1259000	we tried to get an official spokesperson officially sanctioned by a local chapter of the DSA and
1259480	1261200	we tried for
1261200	1264800	multiple months, I want to say four or five in total and
1265600	1270600	Then we took matters into our own hands and just were like hey this guy. I think he knows something
1270880	1275120	Let's get him like the socialist activists that we are we took matters in our own hands
1275120	1278000	But I don't know whose fault that is that it's their fault
1278000	1281880	And if they want to be taken seriously as a political group, they should get on their shit
1282920	1285960	Do we know for sure that Levy is I'm gonna take that stand?
1285960	1293160	Oh, well, I'll take I'll take that stand and I'll take the stand that Steve has been cock blocking them from day one as the alt
1293160	1294240	right
1294240	1301160	Subversive and surgeon that he is okay. Good. Well, let's let's bring up our new friend Josh and Droski
1305120	1309480	Yeah, he's got two cans
1314120	1316740	Hi, oh, how are you?
1319360	1321820	You got some lacrosse there
1324320	1330920	You came up double-fisting some lacrosse I quit drinking and I know this podcast well enough to know that there would be no
1331280	1334360	Non-alcoholic beverages, right? Just like Dino's party
1335200	1341360	It's taking matters into your own hands Spencer did the I don't know if he did it out of fashion or
1342000	1345520	climate control, but you you walked in and
1346520	1348520	You were wearing the same shirt
1348800	1355760	Socialists prove that white people do have culture. I thought you were just gonna say socialist dress like Spencer
1355760	1358880	Yeah, no, we do. We all that's a subtext
1360000	1362000	so
1362400	1363720	I
1363720	1366440	People can Google and they can Wikipedia and stuff. I
1366960	1371640	Wikipedia'd and googled for the 11-minute drive from Las Villas to Burbank
1373200	1376500	Here's what you can learn by reading and scrolling
1377120	1378200	the
1378200	1385320	DSA was once a part of the is the international socialist or socialist international SI Sports Illustrated
1385320	1387320	If they were playing ball, but illustrated
1387800	1393600	Our swimsuit issue was like really revolutionary. We had one swimsuit for all the models
1393760	1400660	It was Betty Friedan wearing a burka. Yeah, it was wearing gas masks. It was Frida Kahlo designed it. It was incredible
1401600	1407960	But there was a split in 82 the D what we now call the DSA like voted to extricate themselves
1408360	1410360	from the larger global
1410760	1412760	Socialists basically
1413080	1418720	None of that shit matters at all the history and and what I mean to say is I don't know
1421920	1426320	Fundamentally transformed during the last election, right? It's now what it is
1426320	1432200	It's but it's important to note for instance that it's not a political party, right? No, you don't have a candidate
1432800	1438800	Right. So we're not a political party in the sense that we're not gonna fall and hopefully this is this is what people have worked
1439040	1445760	Towards and and my friends and myself have worked towards we don't want to fall into the trapping of the green party where you just
1446160	1451520	Every four years trot out somebody that is like whatever just a person
1452000	1459080	Good or bad and then it's like every four years. You're like, hey, let's change everything from the president down because nobody knows who the fuck
1459080	1462880	We are exactly. Well, also it just falls apart. Like I just can't
1463880	1467080	If we have a problem with the way the system has been run
1467400	1472320	Part of the problem is that there's just some knucklehead who supposedly is supposed to not offend everybody
1472640	1477480	Right every minute of every day and and supposedly that there's you know that the president
1477480	1481880	I think Donald Trump has proven more than anything that the president doesn't really do that much
1482400	1485360	That the president is more of a figurehead right now
1486000	1490280	And and certainly can't what we do know about that office is that you can't
1490600	1494800	Blow up the world from it within less than a year, right?
1494800	1498880	Which like makes it relatively less powerful then let's say the head of al-qaeda
1499040	1505160	Yeah, or or there are general you know, like an unelected person in our government
1505160	1506240	and
1506240	1511720	So what what we have done as far as like the idea of like are we a political party or not?
1512160	1517360	In local elections, that's where we're focusing. We truly think you you were talking about
1518320	1523680	How it's like the big robot fight like the Pacific Rim between the Democrats and the Republicans or whatever
1523760	1529020	We're the little land speeders tying their likes together, you know, like if
1530440	1532440	Yes, this is Rob Schwab
1532640	1539840	Snowspeeder, we're the little snow speeders. Fuck. Nobody likes a DSA anymore cuz I fucked up the Star Wars reference. This is bad
1540960	1546840	So no, no, I don't think that's what oh you said. Oh, he said land speeders and you're correcting him
1546840	1554160	Wow, right. I'm catching up. Yes Christ Schwab by the way, is that little black box that Chewbacca scared on the Death Star?
1555240	1558260	Only there's no Chewbacca's here. Well, they make the whole Death Star out of
1560800	1567280	Droid I'm guessing you're asking cuz you know, I don't know. Oh, oh, wow
1567280	1569280	It's a four
1570400	1572380	2069
1572380	1574380	I can never forget
1574880	1579880	All right, but uh, but yeah, so it's but that's important to know cuz right away to me
1579880	1583080	It's like because it I mean there you backed
1584200	1585840	I'm saying you like you're this whole group
1585840	1591000	But the you you you you you pick a candidate in these big fights sure
1591040	1597680	Well traditionally no, but in this last election, yes with Bernie because Bernie was the only candidate
1598200	1600200	that was left of
1601040	1607760	Sort of the centrist opinion who actually had a shot and so I wasn't with them during that period
1607760	1610960	But I know that they were like, hey, let's back burn
1611640	1614920	but for me and like the way that I got into the DSA is
1615760	1616680	I
1616680	1620540	Wanted I was sick and tired. I was always the guy when like the bad shit would happen
1621040	1622880	That I would be the first guy out to protest
1622880	1627920	I would be the first person out to do a benefit show about the bad thing and I was sick and tired of
1628680	1633320	Reacting to all the bad shit and I was like, well, how do you stop the bad shit from happening?
1633320	1638000	And I thought I'm one guy. I'm not a billionaire
1638000	1643020	And you know, I'm not like Timothy Comcast with access to all the resources in the world that little prick
1643040	1647560	Yeah, fucking Timothy has not earned his position as CEO of Comcast at all
1647560	1653720	Obviously nepotism clear. I mean, there's no way that's a coincidence. Yeah. No, I know he says he spells it with a K
1653720	1656160	But we all know he's fuckin. Yeah, it's just like his dad
1657720	1660720	He's got the antenna and the blinking light on his forehead. Yeah
1662000	1670920	So I I saw that the DSA was doing stuff locally and the idea that we all fight in all these similar battles
1670920	1675040	You know everybody's fighting for better housing for better medicine to treat
1675880	1682000	Oppressed groups like human beings like we all have these fights locally within our own communities
1682000	1689220	And so if every city bands together and makes you know topples their local Trump
1689560	1695240	Then that will lead to a domino effect because there's trumps everywhere and oftentimes
1695240	1699840	They're way funnier and crazier than the actual Trump because they don't think anyone's looking at them
1699840	1707200	Mm-hmm. And so it's all about it's like probably local wrestling franchises are like way more crazy than right WCW or whatever
1707200	1713600	Yeah, like the ECW where they were is that guy really stare into the Sun man. Yeah, is that guy dancing queen?
1713600	1721240	He's the haba themed wrestler the outlet for Kerr this seems irresponsible, but that's district 12. Watch out for running with scissors, man
1722280	1727800	Hey kids, we're out there grab those scissors left-handed right-handed run with them. You gotta run free
1727800	1732320	Don't let me people make you walk with scissors. You're gonna scare in the Sun. You're gonna put those scissors on an outlet whoa
1733440	1740040	His catchphrase is whoa. That's actually his entire catchphrase. He says that every time he's he's he's army
1740960	1745160	Yeah, well or he's sent of a woman to derivative. Yeah, it is Pacino
1745160	1749960	That's Pacino's latest role is running with scissors man. He has just become a caricature of himself. Oh
1751200	1756000	God, oh whoa, whoa diggity dog. Hey, who am I? I don't know. That's just wanna diggity dog
1756720	1762000	Did he say that in dog day afternoon? Yeah, probably diggity dog. I want my I want my ransom
1762000	1767700	I want my my trans lover. I want my I want to talk to a negotiator diggity dog dog day. We got a dog day here
1771120	1775760	I peed next to him at the restaurant and he was and he would had the headphones and he was like, I think learning lions
1776640	1778640	I'm paying next to a chance
1778640	1780640	Oh
1785040	1790720	As it's coming out is that the reaction to the it was it a good I think he was burning lines he had
1791200	1793720	he had little ear buds and and he
1796480	1801000	No, this is part of what the explanation for what Pacino became as an icon
1801000	1806920	Like it's that he started running lines at the urinals. So he's suffering from piss shiver while he's like committing these lines
1807160	1813040	He you know, it's funny. I mentioned that then tonight shows been brought to you by piss shiver piss shiver

1939600	1944300	How you pronounce any fun little like you know a little sugar-coated
1945680	1951880	I was just a lot of just me being an idiot. I don't I don't really have what's your secret Rob?
1951880	1954280	But what would you go into a room say things?
1954680	1960160	That's my when you're in a room full of strangers if you could give people out there any advice
1960680	1963280	What would be your advice to somebody?
1964360	1968080	Going into a room full of strangers and how to win them over
1968600	1972820	Oh, God, I don't know and like a social or a professional setting. Yeah, either
1973440	1976960	Let's just say at a social setting like like
1977800	1982840	Thanksgiving I don't know how I would I don't think I've ever won anybody over well
1982840	1987960	I will take some time with that question and then the format of the show will be it will will will swivel back over to
1988720	1994440	To talking about DSA and then we'll we'll we'll we'll when we come back to shrub
1994760	1997400	We're gonna learn his secret for when he enters a room
2001640	2003640	Just think about it
2004240	2007760	Monetize it he just has to know what just think about it for five minutes
2007760	2013480	I'm gonna talk to Josh and Draski from the DSA and then you think about your secret Rob your secret
2016840	2019160	Be a fake interviewer for
2020040	2026320	Know about I'm saying like let's blend this this is good. It's like parfait. So just think about the answer to that question
2026320	2031360	What are you? What's your secret? Josh? We can't really talk about the Democratic
2032160	2038680	Party or the remnants thereof without talking about this new word that I learned neoliberalism. Ah, yes
2039600	2041800	neoliberalism neoliberalism is basically
2043960	2045960	Socially liberal
2046000	2053520	But not but like fiscally conservative and as somebody corporately generally corporate, right and I forget who who tweeted this
2053520	2057840	It's one of my favorite tweets. It was I'm socially liberal, but fiscally conservative
2057840	2062680	I hate the problems, but I love their causes and and that's really what it is
2062680	2068180	It's it's like and somebody else tweeted like the the platonic ideal of neoliberalism is to have
2068440	2075280	Racial and gender balance on the board of a drone company, right, you know, it's like this hollow identity politics something like
2076320	2079320	Los Angeles's district attorney is a woman of color, right?
2079320	2085900	And you think that's a victory to have a black woman in such a big, you know position of power and it is however
2085900	2091160	She has not persecuted any murderous policeman in her entire tenure
2091160	2096800	And so something like that would be like an example of that's probably neoliberalism in action
2096800	2102040	it's somebody who doesn't want to upset the status quo who doesn't want who still wants the
2102320	2106440	Ultra wealthy to be as rich as possible and the rest of us to be fighting for crumbs
2106760	2111920	But it's the thing that was working yesterday, which I have found in my exploration of white fragility
2111920	2117400	I went and bought a gun. That's a classic neoliberal move. I would say I mean, it's just a classic white dude move
2117400	2123400	That's a classic scared white guy move is to buy it's the scared white guy and my therapist and say who's the gun for?
2124400	2130040	But she's my therapist. So she's I didn't realize until 10 minutes in the conversation. She's asking is it for you?
2130560	2133680	Yeah, cuz Hunter S Thompson bought one at one point
2134400	2138400	Didn't buy it for himself like and I'm like, thank you for that equation famous
2140160	2146480	More important blowing his brains out and letting his daughter find them great suicide note though. Yeah football season's over
2146760	2150560	There but it was it because it's it was yeah
2150560	2154160	It's it's the appeal the billboard for neoliberalism now
2154200	2160840	I think I've been a spokesman for it in my behavior and my if I if I just put my thumb in my mouth and just
2160840	2162840	Say what I'm really feeling without
2164800	2166680	You know Kool-Aid
2166680	2173280	Plunging into some cause that's gonna like not benefit me ultimately or in any immediate way that I can feel
2173280	2178600	Right. I just follow my comfort. I am a neoliberal. I want my Obama back. I want my
2179560	2184200	Right, yeah, and and that is something that people need to I
2185960	2189040	Want you to have committed more to your
2190840	2193300	In there I want my bomb my back my back my back
2194560	2197600	There's gotta be somebody has done that come on
2198920	2200920	technocratic
2200920	2202400	bureaucratic
2203160	2205160	Oh
2205160	2209120	Because then there's ribs and then that's an unfortunate cultural connotation. Yeah step into
2209720	2214660	But you did a really good job of avoiding it until you mentioned that you avoided it, right? I know. Well, that's me
2214660	2219040	That's classic Harmon. Hey everybody. Look, I'm not racist because I wasn't thinking about this
2220880	2222880	Shrob all right. What's your secret?
2223400	2225280	No, excuse. I
2225280	2230000	You know, how are you cutting it up? How am I cutting it up? I don't know. I was just being an idiot
2230000	2231920	I like there was
2231920	2239120	Two children there and they're nice at that age that they just are laughing at any how old attention. Uh, I
2239760	2241760	think like
2244160	2246160	Like four and
2247160	2253560	Six those are good. Those are good social ages. Like I like I like the fours and the sixes. Yeah, I get yeah
2255360	2260600	Like because they're verbal and they're but they're in their inquisitive and they're like they're yeah
2260600	2264900	If you talk to them like a grown-up, they can they're pretty fun. Yeah, dude
2266360	2270700	Not to pry like this could go into personal stuff with you and Kate who I married
2271720	2275000	You married Kate. I officiated your marriage to her
2275960	2279720	You guys had no plans to have children, which is why you didn't bother getting very MC at that wedding
2279720	2284440	Yeah, are you is there any change there? Is there any capacity for change to the two of you ever talk about it?
2284440	2289840	You know, no, you just you just resolve no kids like you're both totally I think it's got it
2290320	2292320	It's come up
2292320	2295100	Kate just is not interested and I'm like
2295960	2298560	Fine with that. I don't really
2300000	2305280	There's other people's kids. Yeah, I mean there's other people's kids. I you know, my biggest thing about
2306440	2308440	children is
2308640	2310440	parents I
2310440	2315480	Don't I you know what happens to do you have kids am I insulting you? Okay
2316000	2319160	I'm sorry. Yeah. No, I do not have kids. Okay, so
2320000	2324840	It's just I see what happens to people when they become
2326520	2330960	Parents and it's it's something that's you know great for them
2331480	2337120	But not cool parents in the world and I think I have seen them like I really the cool parents are the worst
2337120	2343120	Well, they're not the worst but I well because I know they're the worst. Well, there's there's things that it heightens
2343200	2345040	the
2345040	2347640	The actual cool parents who are people who are I'm like, wow
2347640	2350280	Well, that's as good as you're gonna get as far as parenting
2350280	2354800	I still recognize the parenting has subsumed their identity and but that's it
2354800	2362040	I mean like it's the thing the thing like first of all, I'll put my dog up against any baby any day any day
2367200	2369200	Your dog
2373120	2376560	My dog against a baby just like
2377240	2379240	What are you gonna do?
2380000	2385040	More durable than that Rob Schwab runs a baby dogfight ring out of his fucking
2388760	2390360	What I was
2390360	2396440	Saying so where are these fights if we wanted to like buy tickets like I just said when you interrupted me
2396440	2400800	That's not what I meant. How do you get baby blood out of a carpet? I
2401800	2404940	Didn't mean that well, I meant
2405840	2407640	Comparing my dog
2407640	2415280	To a baby. Yes. Okay, so finish that thought you've like a dog a dog is my dog. You could experience a not a dog
2415920	2420280	My dog you can experience your dog the notorious baby killer
2421280	2423280	Like I just said
2423280	2428720	That's not what I meant. All right. Well, all right swiveling back over Josh
2429200	2434200	We can't and that's how I charm a new group of
2435840	2437360	People
2437360	2444160	Talk about the classic thing but for kids, maybe it's not classic like Marxism versus communism versus socialism
2444880	2450360	Marx versus like for like I just found out about this guy Michael Harrington who's like that was
2451360	2453120	He's dead, right?
2453120	2454120	Yeah
2454200	2456920	But he was an author activist whatever he's sort of the
2457240	2460560	Maybe that could we say the Chomsky of the DSA or something?
2460560	2461480	I don't know again
2461480	2467160	Like he's a guy who I personally haven't really and this is like the thing that I love about the DSA is I
2467280	2469280	Dropped out of high school. I
2469440	2475200	Have never read Marx. I think that socialism is as a concept
2475200	2480760	It's it's mostly the liberation of your own body from like a corporate overlord
2480840	2487040	It's basically the idea of putting the the capital putting the the means of production
2487160	2489760	Which is specifically what Marx talked about. I've read quotes
2490840	2496160	Specifically like I said, you got the the Snapple the limited edition. Yes, Mark Snapple
2496160	2500400	Yeah, which is weird that his estate agreed to any sort of commodification. Yeah
2501440	2506200	I think you had a lot to do with old world blue blood relationships
2507120	2513960	The Snapple fortune was you know, the the Marx chewing gum company that which is something they've buried in the history books
2513960	2519000	Yeah, they don't talk about that. Um, they're both Proctor and Gamble. Yeah, so but anyways
2519000	2523840	The but but but but Mark Marx is it like I'm with you. I've no research
2523840	2527280	I'm 11 minutes of of of Wikipedia
2527280	2533600	right the reason I bring this stuff up is because for instance your average 16 year old kid right now who
2533840	2538080	For better or for worse is is waiting in the same swimming pool that we all are
2538880	2542360	I'm getting in fights on the reg fam
2543320	2544480	with
2544480	2548140	People who they can they they could be children, right?
2548640	2551200	They could be 40 years older than me
2551200	2557200	they could be any of those things and be totally but we're all we're all splashing around in the same pool and
2557680	2561080	that's a distinct advantage to people who are driven by
2562040	2567840	Competition and individualism and and I'll say it hatred like because you can say for instance
2568400	2575080	If I were to say I'm having the DSA on my show tomorrow night. Someone might say for instance, I don't know
2575080	2576360	Oh, yeah, great
2576360	2579920	You guys think Nazis are responsible for all these deaths that you faked but
2580400	2584880	Communism has been responsible for over 80 billion deaths in the last
2585520	2591000	120 years blah blah blah because they want to label and they want to and this is this is
2591080	2597480	The thing that I would say like if if there's anything that I've learned. It's get off the fucking internet
2598120	2603920	Stop your like book clubs are fine. Like you can read Marx and talk about whatever but I
2604440	2605600	learned
2605600	2607600	everything I know about
2607640	2609320	politics about
2609320	2611320	socialism about you know
2611480	2618960	The thing that radicalized me was going and meeting people hearing people hearing people that work for teachers unions hearing
2619000	2623080	You know some like intellectuals that are like, you know work as professors or whatever
2623640	2627140	just rank-and-file union folks and and
2627560	2632600	nurses and this and that and and talking to all these people and watching the action and
2633240	2638240	Participating in an action. That's what that's what teaches me and to me specifically
2638240	2646240	I think that we as socialists we as leftists need to remove ourselves from the world of academia because I think that that was
2646360	2650280	Purposefully done that was sort of a move like oh, let's get them all in their little bubbles
2650280	2655640	they're little coastal bubbles where they just sit and they wear glasses and they look like their bones are gonna break if they wear a
2655640	2660880	Sweater and they fucking talk and talk and talk and they just want to jerk off over which dead Russian dude
2661040	2667600	Like they liked the most right and and really playing philosophical chess on a daytime talk show
2667840	2670640	It's the same fucking thing. It's it's who's your team?
2670640	2677360	Who's this and and a lot of politics not just like leftist politics a lot of like national politics is just sports as well
2677680	2683320	but when you actually get offline and and and get out of the you know university and and
2683440	2689040	Go on to the streets and start talking about people and trying to help them like, you know, DSA right now
2689040	2692320	For example, like doing an action like this will teach you more
2692320	2697640	I think personally about socialism than reading anything they're putting on a tail light benefit
2697960	2702640	DSA Los Angeles is doing this inspired by DSA, New Orleans. So the thought was
2703920	2705920	people of color migrant workers
2706120	2708120	You know just undocumented folks
2708680	2713680	They are getting pulled over and they are being thrown into the carceral state
2713680	2720360	They're being thrown into you know, if you're undocumented, you're being thrown into a private prison where they hold immigrants
2720360	2722640	It's not like they go to a Radisson. They go to a private prison
2723520	2729280	or if you're just a fucking black dude, you're gonna get fucked with by the cops because the police is
2729720	2731960	inherently a racist system and so
2733000	2739000	What we're doing is we are for free providing break lights if your brake lights out
2739000	2744660	That's most likely what's gonna get you pulled over right on then they can search your car and stuff because you look not white
2744680	2752560	right exactly and and and it could and likely often does end up with some unarmed person being shot and so if we
2752640	2757040	If that is a concept that's like borrowed from the Black Panthers known as like mutual aid
2757200	2764560	we help them but they also help us because we have now ingrained ourselves in the community more and so we can like
2764640	2771160	Get more people to go do more cool shit. Right? And it's like who's this fucking dude that just gave me a free brake light
2771160	2773680	Hey, no, we promise. We're not asking you for anything
2774960	2779080	Your Facebook login. We don't want any of you do that a hundred times then
2779800	2782080	So you turn turning your money into
2783080	2789640	Into shit that actually translates with the most fidelity into changing an individual life. Absolutely
2789640	2793520	And it's not how do you do that? How do you just distribute the I mean, that's awesome
2793520	2800480	Right. So for what we have if you go to dsa-la org and you look and you click on the taillight benefit page
2800800	2806420	There is a like a Kickstarter type thing. It's it's within our our chapters
2807020	2811460	Like a fundraising thing and so so far we've raised over a thousand dollars
2811460	2815740	And then what happens is we just ask around to friends who know mechanics
2815740	2821620	We've reached out to high schools that have shop classes. We're looking for a venue now a large parking lot
2822220	2826260	The school would be rad because ice can't come on school property
2826780	2832580	and and so what we do is we then talk to our friends and say hey who knows how to
2833380	2838380	How to change a brake light then they run a training for the interested volunteers
2838380	2843980	So now our volunteers know how to fix their own cars and then they go help fix other people's cars and then you know
2843980	2848180	Just nice. Yeah, like I got like that's appealing to a guy like me because I'm like, oh shit
2848180	2852460	No, I feel a little more macho because I know I'm dealing in brake lights now, right?
2853620	2856260	That's use your hands to help speaking of which
2856820	2861140	like like not to put you on the spot, but a guy like me so
2862100	2863300	like
2863300	2864580	classically
2864580	2872500	Fragile neoliberal like like it may be philosophically progressive. No research total comfort zone five-bedroom house
2873660	2876680	Just want everything to go back to the way it was shuttering at night
2877500	2884900	Fearing not being able to protect my girlfriend from any form of economic destabilization and any manifestation thereof just want my comfort back
2884900	2890180	I felt like I was playing the game right blah blah blah. Oh, you can read it at all in my pamphlet
2890940	2892940	You get the picture with me
2893780	2900980	Guy like whether it's the famous version of me, but also I'm selfishly asking like what are more like like
2901620	2903980	You're directing me to that website in this case
2903980	2907540	But like what are what are what are like what are like little pieces of candy?
2907540	2912820	You can hand out once I get it on my tongue at no risk to my own comfort
2912820	2917420	Right, you know that when I taste it, it'll it'll start happening
2917620	2924100	This is a thing that we talk about a lot that that our health care committee and a lot of people working nationally the health
2924100	2927820	Care committee talk about is the difference between selfishness
2928740	2934780	Self-lessness and self-interest. These are three different things selfishness is hey, I got all this money
2934780	2939980	I don't want it to go to anybody no taxes whatever and and you know pure greed, right?
2940300	2943900	Or you know conversely, it's I broke my leg
2943900	2947580	I need Medicare for all because my leg is broken, right?
2948900	2953460	Self-lessness is I'm a perfectly healthy person. I don't need anything
2953500	2959700	I'll never be sick because I take my bone marrow. I've got extra marrow right and you're doing this for somebody else and not for you
2959700	2961060	at all, but
2961060	2967940	Selfless or self-interest. I like this thing like this already self-interest is how can I help everybody else out?
2967940	2971100	Well also helping myself out because we're all in this together
2971100	2977220	And so that kind of that's the the tone that we're aiming for when we talk to you guys like that third one, right?
2977220	2979220	Yes, okay. Good. Yes
2982460	2988500	Well, because it's like it's like you could there is room in the world for people under an actual
2988980	2995900	form of democratic socialism, right like like like tell me yes or no, I think the big root fear for
2996380	3001900	For I would say especially but definitely including poor people is hey wait
3001900	3007700	I don't want the rules to monopoly to be that you can't have more money than someone else
3007700	3011900	Right and see this is a thing that that is you know, a very successful
3012460	3018900	Propaganda campaign that it's conflating communism and socialism essentially, right and and democratic socialism
3019140	3023420	Specifically is not like a state like it's not like this big state power
3023860	3030440	Roads and Medicare are socialist then they exist in a social security is socialist. So it exists today
3030860	3034980	Absolutely. It's not communism probably the most famous form of socialism is social security
3034980	3040780	And what it is is it's not only a thing that benefits people from people that already have too much
3040940	3042700	Where it's like this is fair
3042700	3044220	We all agree that you know
3044220	3049580	Everybody knows that the people at the top aren't paying enough and and so we all can agree that like okay
3049580	3053540	They just get paid a little bit for they pay a little bit fucking more into taxes
3053540	3058860	And then literally we all have health care. We all have access to a doctor. It's that easy and
3059660	3066380	What we want more is like a co-op where you're a worker you own your company
3066380	3068820	You're a shareholder. There's not a room full of
3069380	3074380	faceless number men in you know, gray smoky suits with fucking
3074380	3078940	You know just like guns to a dog's head and all the profits go to stockholders
3079060	3082860	Yeah, the shareholders right with their interests and so like a good example
3082860	3084940	This is another thing that we're doing with the DSA right now
3084940	3092580	Which is we are trying to help Los Angeles create a public bank not for you and me to go to the ATM
3092740	3098060	But when you think about it Los Angeles has something like eight billion dollars in
3098780	3106780	700 bank accounts all at Wells Fargo at the one at that one bank and that eight billion dollars is everything from your electric bill payments
3106860	3107860	to
3107860	3115180	Your taxes to fees to 401k plans for city clerks when that money is in Wells Fargo
3115220	3119300	Wells Fargo then through loans and dividends and investments and whatnot
3119300	3125660	They spread that money to Philip Morris spread that money to weapons companies and and keystone pipeline
3126100	3130560	Exactly. Yes, what's the phrase for this again? That's how Sarah Silverman talking about it. You know
3131820	3137820	divest divestment and and so a lot of people Sarah Silverman being one of them and
3137900	3143900	Myself included have divested our personal money from big Wall Street banks and put them into credit unions
3143900	3146560	But now what we're asking is for cities for
3147180	3153020	Municipalities because you and me and we do like this. It's a drop in the bucket by eight billion dollars
3153060	3157860	That is not gonna get invested in horrible fossil fuels or private prisons
3157860	3162060	It's a big chunk of change to get out of you were talking about that this idea
3162860	3167660	Politics started to get subsumed by the banking industry. I'll be talking out of my ass
3167660	3172100	There's this YouTube documentary you can watch called hyper normalization, which is very scary
3172100	3172340	It's great
3172340	3177400	one of the things that talked about is there is this huge change where the bankers who were
3177820	3183980	Defacto funding everything on the government's behalf because banks have stand to gain from being in the business of government
3183980	3188300	They're like, yeah, let's go along. We'll give you the loan. You can make this building. We'll make City Hall
3188300	3191940	We're working together as a team. They went from that to saying wait a second
3191940	3195260	We have all the money fuck you guys do everything we say
3195540	3199900	Because we're a private corporation that now holds the purse strings for the government
3199900	3206780	And when that fundamental power shift changed kind of everything got ruined and fucked so it sounds like this is kind of a reversal
3206780	3212660	It's D. It's defanging the power that finance has our private finance has over the government
3212660	3217540	Which shouldn't be in the business of private finance finances should be in the business of aiding people
3217780	3223740	Right exactly. And and so these you know when when when your electric bill is sitting at Wells Fargo
3223780	3225580	Wells Fargo is making you know
3225580	3228980	if you pay your electric bill with a credit card Wells Fargo gets a fee and
3229060	3234020	That's just coming right off the top from government into yeah, it doesn't go to the government
3234020	3236860	It doesn't go to make your roads better or your schools better
3236860	3239420	It goes into some fucking cokeheads pocket, you know
3239420	3246060	And so what we want is to create a municipal bank where then all of this money is housed in an institution
3246060	3254420	That's central motive isn't profit. Its central motive is hey, we are this is city public money. It's your money
3254420	3259260	It's my money. It's all of our money. It should stay in Los Angeles and beyond that
3259260	3262500	We should open it up so that people historically that have had a hard time
3263100	3268460	Getting loans can get loans we can use this money like you know if it's run
3268460	3270860	Well, which banks happen to be run
3270860	3277100	Well when it comes to collecting a profit at the end of the year instead of that profit going to bankers that profit can go
3277100	3284100	Into housing or schools and the like the theory behind the American dream is that money is the great
3284660	3289660	Equalizer that that it is like somehow a supreme kind of meta form of democracy
3289660	3295540	That doesn't have to happen every four years pulling a lever that you can work hard and work so hard
3295780	3303380	that love your children so much love your family so much that you can chisel away at so much fucking coal in a mine that
3304020	3308340	That you're while you're your coal mining colleague is like yeah, you know
3308340	3311100	I love mining coal, but I'm gonna go home and
3311900	3315060	Fucking chill I can't wait to get off of work, and I figured out a way to mine coal
3315060	3319620	But that if you for whatever reason you're like god damn it
3319620	3327180	I'm fucking gonna mine so much fucking coal and that that that somehow that represents some kind of egress that you can become a
3327380	3331460	Capitalist that you can become that you can you can that?
3332460	3338020	every there are people listening to that that disagree with me politically, but
3338700	3341100	Absolutely everyone agrees that that's what's for sale
3341100	3343700	It is the s whenever anyone detracts
3343700	3349580	So whenever someone like cries out for rights or fair treatment and people start coming down to them and saying like why don't you?
3349620	3352300	Get a fucking job. Why don't you just work hard? What do you mean?
3352300	3357940	Isn't this a slippery slope all this stuff every all of those sentiments lead back to the Rome of yeah?
3357940	3364460	but shouldn't we just live in a society where if you work extra hard harder than the person next to you that that represents a
3366780	3371820	Changed opportunity to play the monopoly game right and fundamentally
3371820	3374380	It's a flawed premise because that doesn't take into account
3374380	3378120	historical context of people of color being subjugated and
3378580	3385860	Generationally not being put in a position where they can get this job so that leads white people who don't know that they have
3385860	3390660	You know started the race at the finish line going like hey look at these people lagging in the back
3390660	3395060	Maybe if they ran faster like and and the thing is it's not your fault
3395060	3402580	if you're a white dude that that racism exists and that's like a big problem with a lot of people on the left that are
3403100	3410180	Correctly angry, but aren't trying to bring people in like and go you know I don't hate every Trump voter
3410180	3417780	I think that talking about Trump voters as this this like huge amorphous blob of hate is wrong. It's wrong-headed. It's bad
3418980	3421180	20% I'll give 20% of Trump voters
3421780	3423780	irreparable racists horrible people
3423780	3429300	But I really truly believe that 80% of Trump voters have a kid that's addicted to
3429300	3435380	Opiates or lost their house or lost their job and like you said they kept fucking working hard and nothing happened
3435380	3437500	And so they wanted to make a change
3437500	3443100	They just wanted to give a big fuck you to the system that ruined their lives and the Democrats
3443260	3447860	Seeing this and this is why I don't think you can work within the Democratic Party because ultimately
3447980	3452980	They're beholden to their donors, but they see this and who do they trot out to fight this the?
3453620	3455620	Avatar of the status quo
3455620	3459140	And you see it happen over and over and over again
3459140	3464500	And the only time that it works is if you have literally the most charismatic man who's ever been like
3465260	3470580	Nominated for president to sell that bill of goods to people yeah, and if that ever happened boy
3471180	3478540	You'd know it because there would be this actual measurable shift in everything from economy to society
3479060	3483460	To the point, and I'm not I'm not kissing his feet, but it's like that's
3484180	3489060	We cannot wait for another guy that happens to be that lightning in a jar
3489460	3495180	Like as long as it's I don't know cuz I think Obama as a man is a great man
3495180	3500220	I think he as a president. I disagreed with a lot of his decisions
3500940	3504780	Obviously compared to the other guys. You know that sandwiched him
3504860	3509500	He was this golden. You know statue of pure greatness
3509500	3512380	But when you I think the Democrats
3512980	3520340	Fundamentally don't understand how power works because if they did they wouldn't have lost thousands of state legislature seats under Obama
3520380	3522700	How when you have such a popular president?
3522700	3529700	Can you just get fucking creamed in every local election and it's because the Democrats are just so top-heavy
3530060	3535620	They're this big bobblehead that is just doomed to fall forward and not move
3536020	3541420	Yeah, okay, and so that's why we at the DSA. We're not targeting even senators or you know
3541420	3548260	Can't we want state legislature thing that we all have in common with these these let's say these 20% of Trump voters who actually voted
3548260	3554340	On a frustration you can you that we're cousins all of us if you in your backyard
3555300	3557300	Have there's a pothole that hasn't been filled
3557380	3563180	Right there if if if if by virtue of some bureaucratic absurdity your kids
3565620	3567620	Leukemia isn't covered
3569140	3572020	Everybody bureaucratic absurdity in that case by the way is great
3573140	3575140	It's definitely great
3575220	3581980	And it's just that because it's just by virtue of belt buckles and baseball caps and the way that we express
3582140	3588420	When we aren't armed with Noam Chomsky's vocabulary our frustration with a system some guy
3589300	3597060	Right next to me in terms of tax bracket and ideology is gonna. Maybe say key phrases that I have been armed to
3598180	3601080	Recognize as the enemy well when these guys start talking about
3601780	3606620	Freedom of speech they mean they mean they want to be Nazis when these guys start talking about
3607140	3611780	Where's my gold pocket watch what they mean is that they wanted this institutionalized thing?
3611780	3614380	And then they're hearing the same thing when these people talk about
3615060	3617260	Black lives matter they mean blah blah blah
3617260	3621180	It's like I mean we've all said it a thousand times, and it's right under our nose like the
3622140	3626780	Divisions there are so artificially imposed they have to be forced otherwise if you
3627300	3632060	Like like you know these movies where like society collapses and then like within 30 years
3632060	3635780	There's just ivy and wolves everywhere like like there is
3636420	3642500	Constant infrastructural pressure necessary to maintain a division between a black person and a white person in America
3642500	3648260	You have to wake up every morning and make sure those two people know that they're black and white and they do and and the powers
3648260	3652540	That be do that and you know it starts you know you go back to Howard Zinn who is somebody
3652540	3655900	I have read a lot and and really like to find my worldview
3656700	3660900	He talks about how after one of the first big slave rebellions
3661540	3669780	Where white slaves and black slaves teamed up the powers that were were like oh fuck if all of the poor people
3669780	3676020	Team up were fucked so they created the middle class they were like okay white slaves in the new world
3676260	3679780	When you guys you guys got 20 years and then you'll get a house
3679780	3684780	And you'll get a car and you'll get you're not a car by a horse which was they called them cars back then
3685420	3689300	but you get a house and a horse and fucking you know 40 acres in a mule and and
3690060	3696100	That was so there's a horse in every pot a horse in every pot and a chicken under foot every one day the pot
3696100	3698100	We'll have wheels we promise yeah
3698580	3700580	the wheel pot and
3700580	3702180	real pot
3702180	3708100	Yeah, hell. Yeah, so what that does is that makes it so that and you're right
3708100	3712500	It is this intense artificial pressure, but it is very specific and it is there
3713380	3719300	Purposefully and it's to keep the people that are two rungs from the bottom of the ladder kicking down
3719300	3725340	Yep, just constantly kicking down and if we all realize that we're all being fucked and don't try to
3726300	3731340	Buy into the artificial fucking separation of who we are and allow
3731620	3736100	Each other to make mistakes and whatnot that's how the labor movement got us a weekend
3736300	3736940	You know
3736940	3744300	It was these people weren't less racist back when labor had more power in America people were more racist
3744300	3745820	We get less racist every year
3745820	3752500	But through great organizing and people that literally died and standing up for their rights
3752660	3758380	You saw black people white people men and women team up to go we're all getting fucked
3758380	3761820	Some of us might be getting fucked less some of us may be getting fucked more
3762060	3768140	But we're banding together because again self-interest it helps me it helps everybody else
3768140	3772700	We need to band together on this. Let's check in with Rob Schwab after this beat
3774100	3776100	Give me a beat and
3776100	3781860	Rob I hear you're about to grace us with some tips on how to make your Thanksgiving more vegan friendly

3905740	3910660	You when your kid goes in and they make him cough and it turns out he one of his testicles has a tumor

4022140	4029300	That's the exact dance Hillary did on Ellen yeah, it's great. Let's hear of a church. Yeah, thanks church
4033180	4037460	Church come back up here. You guys are talking about going to
4037460	4043500	Thanksgiving's I met her parents and her father is
4044940	4047500	John Goodman from the Big Lebowski
4048140	4052700	But like kind of mellow and funny and he's military
4053380	4060300	But it was cool meeting your family and he declared no political talk. No Trump talk. No
4062380	4064180	Yeah, and
4064180	4072580	Your mother voted Trump. Nope. No, he doesn't know that though. Oh, she secretly didn't do it. Yeah. Yeah, and he declared before
4074340	4080020	Thanksgiving dinner that there would be no politics talk mostly because he knew he'd be outnumbered. Yeah
4084300	4090820	No fight your medals for silencing discourse during this holiday I give you
4091580	4093580	In between dinner and pie
4093780	4099100	Things started to lean towards politics talk and I went and played Legos with the because he wanted more pie
4104260	4107660	Yeah, Dan it was trickle-down cool whip
4110020	4115860	A lot of people think that if you you know, if you put up more cool up, it'll trickle down onto more pie
4115860	4123980	It's not true. It's not true. No, I'll eat it all but church is a genius because she's like Spock like she you're a logic
4124660	4129420	Like junky and you can take your dad out and you get you she took him out for an hour
4129940	4133460	outside smoked cigarettes or you smoked he vaped and
4134100	4138380	They came back in and he you had fucking I had fixed him. You'd sorted him out
4139100	4144500	Sorted him out temporarily wait explain like how like tangible was this fix?
4145020	4151300	Well, most people when they talk to my father and I've noticed this online too and this happens with my uncle and my cousins
4151300	4153300	as people react really
4153820	4154780	emotionally
4154780	4156420	right to the
4156420	4161080	obviously heinous shit that they're saying the excuses they're making for things that are inexcusable and like
4161220	4165580	The truth is is that everything keeps coming back to this but Hillary argument
4165580	4168620	And the reason is is that all of those excuses?
4169100	4174640	all of those defending of Roy Moore's and all this crap that's happening right now is really just a
4175300	4178960	Defending of the decision they made to vote for someone because they hate Hillary
4179020	4186340	It's got nothing to do with him as a president or anything that's happening and especially with my father being the military guy
4186980	4191060	He's got this notion of the greater good that also comes from a military like well
4191060	4194900	We're ugly and things are terrible and you know, you got to get through it and you know
4194900	4198620	that some things are gonna be bad, but in the long run, it's all gonna be better and
4199340	4201340	That's how he judges
4202460	4208460	Roy Moore's right now because it's for the greater good in his eyes because we had to do this because Hillary
4208460	4214660	We were avoiding this horrible thing and I think that that's a lot of people and their perspective and they saw everybody dancing the streets
4214660	4216860	about hope and change
4216860	4224100	Obama's election and then as a matter of historical economic course their lives didn't get better
4224100	4229820	And and so that obvious connection is made there. Otherwise if you're not a politician
4230540	4234380	It's like Sarah Palin's like how's all that hope and changey stuff going for that?
4234380	4240460	It's and everyone's like yeah, actually we indoctrinate everybody into this dichotomy system where we go like, okay
4240460	4244060	here's the rock'em robot here's the sock a robot and then and I mean I
4245580	4252380	Which like this this idea that we have to just we have to defend not voting for Hillary. It's kind of like
4253020	4258020	It's a default. It's kind of like a macrocosm of saying at the emergency room like now, honey
4258020	4261820	You know, like you made me do that. Well, my dad literally at one point
4262460	4266460	It goes well, I didn't start it and I was like, what are you five and he starts laughing?
4267020	4269660	And I'm like, what's going on right now?
4269660	4274900	Like I'm like you just keep saying you keep going back to this thing and I'm like at a certain point
4274900	4276980	You got to realize like that's over that's done
4277060	4279220	No one's trying to take away from you your
4279540	4285780	Rationale for why you voted the way you did for this piece of human garbage because you were throwing the dice
4286020	4288020	But now that he's president
4288180	4293620	Judge him for what he's doing and he was like, yeah, okay, you know, you're maybe right and I'm like, okay
4294620	4300220	Like if I actually understand and I go like okay, I think I know why you're making
4301340	4304100	Arguments that I know that you don't even believe right now
4304100	4307140	Like I know why you're making the excuses that you're making right now
4307140	4312940	It's like I know that you don't think that it's okay for a 32 year old man to fuck a 14 year old
4312940	4315580	So why is my father saying that right now?
4315580	4322620	Oh, it's because he's defending the indefensible because he has an idea of some kind of greater good and some greater battle that's happening right now
4324620	4328700	In his mind I would say the people some of the people who are defending Roy Moore
4330340	4332340	Careful he's a friend they might
4333300	4340920	Big friend of the show I had no interest in defending Al Franken like and then I read that one article that was like wait
4341300	4344780	Like if Franken gets yanked from the picture
4345700	4347700	This is a blow against net neutrality
4347700	4354100	And then I was like then that because I don't care if a senator gets fucking hauled up to the Robocop
4354740	4358380	police station desk and forced to fucking account for being a
4359340	4362500	They woke up committing a crime if they're a politician
4362500	4368220	This is America if you're a politician you should already be suspected of everything and you should what you should wake up with shame
4368220	4372140	Because you're getting paid to do fucking jack shit, right? You're a parasite
4372140	4376960	Sorry, but but but that's it's a it's a cushy gig. You're a fucking politician eat my dick
4377060	4380900	But and and and wake up every morning in a world where you have to prove that you're not a criminal
4382540	4386620	But then I was like, oh shit net neutrality god damn it
4386660	4389740	There's a goddamn conspiracy this Republican woman wait
4389740	4393260	There's the picture of him doing the titty-hawk, but his fingers aren't touching her
4393260	4398020	You can see shadows under them. My mom and I were bonding about this. You could see shadows under that he's not touch
4398020	4402520	it's a just the only other thing is that her story about tongues and then she got for
4403380	4410020	Anyone watching this from the outside would start to go look at me and go like boy you Democrats you'll do anything to
4410500	4412540	You just love violating women
4412540	4414600	well, and I think that this brings up a
4415140	4421540	Really valuable point of discussion where we need to not have it in 140 characters or we need to actually talk to each other about
4421540	4426300	This shit, but like yeah at the the unavoidable truth that we as people on the left
4426620	4433020	Can do and should hold ourselves to a higher account than people on the right and you know
4433020	4438900	You don't see Roy Moore getting this much pressure from the right and and and that's not good
4439100	4443180	That that the right's doing that we shouldn't like there's no answer to this right now
4443180	4447140	But it's something to really talk about and think about what again remember
4447140	4450340	I think that it's because inherently they're trying to defend
4451340	4459600	Right their guy and their party right now, and they're constantly having to do that so every time one of theirs goes down
4460620	4467260	They're like like fuck we gotta undo. We gotta make every excuse. We got to find out they're lying or whatever it is
4467300	4472460	We're on the left. We're going. I'm not mad at the women who accuse Al Franken
4472460	4477180	I'm like disappointed in Al Franken, and I'm going like God damn like we need you
4477180	4484220	You know like how many others might have got into net neutrality you might even be you might even start to go over the weekend
4484220	4489900	I started to go is this a conspiracy right well. It's happening defending a sexual like now
4490580	4495860	You're just the same like it's the same magical thinking and it's like yeah
4495860	4496940	No, I'm a zealot now
4496940	4498260	My guys are all
4498260	4503940	Infallible because we're the guys with the right the white hat on and your guys are all garbage because they have the black hat on
4503940	4509700	Because we think that good and evil is a black and white thing and if you look at like the board if you look
4509700	4515240	At the whole chessboard the right has won all three branches of government the FCC is probably gonna
4516240	4521320	There's nothing we can do we should fight, but there's nothing we could do like like we should absolutely try
4521320	4524080	But Al Franken isn't gonna change much
4524080	4529600	I think if you really like pull back and look at how much power the right has and to your point
4529600	4530640	Which is a really good point
4530640	4537600	I think that part of this is like these people are conditioned on all sides to come at this defensively
4537840	4542160	Like like and that's a problem of the media. That's a problem of online discourse
4542160	4548320	That's a problem with the way that in which we talk about politics because we get too emotionally invested
4548320	4555520	It's the way we talk about each other too because right dehumanization is I think at its worst point right now and by dehumanization like
4556040	4563240	For me, you know, it's it's it's all about the other right and the other would be anybody who's so
4563640	4565640	Different from your way of being
4565960	4567960	That they are not human
4568120	4572480	Anymore to you like cuz you can't form empathy for them whether that's like and right now
4572760	4579320	That's as simple as being a Democrat in a Republican. It's as simple as driving a Prius instead of a Ford f-150
4579320	4584160	Yeah, like that's literally that's enough for people to say oh, you're not a man
4584360	4587160	Let's make it even simpler because because let's talk about
4587600	4594440	25 year olds who can't afford a Prius or a Ford f-150 aren't making that decision and therefore those decisions are actually ideological for them and
4595320	4598800	Every day for better or for worse whether they should be doing it or not
4599840	4607040	These people are living online. Yeah, and every every and their chimpanzee spinal cords are
4607760	4611680	Jacked up by these interactions. They're having I just did it today
4611680	4614600	I'm a 44 year old grown-ass man
4614920	4620440	Got one fight with my girlfriend while traveling this entire Thanksgiving all these connecting flights all this stress
4620440	4625480	We even high-fived each other and even knew we were jinxing it. We didn't fight we traveled as a couple
4625480	4632600	We didn't fight. We had one kerfuffle and it was absolutely centered around I got on Twitter. Yep
4633880	4636120	we we so but like
4638160	4643440	We can the important thing seems to be that the the way that the internet is
4644320	4646240	the nature of it
4646240	4653560	Favors I'm just gonna use simple language. It favors Nazis. It does not favor hippies
4654520	4660720	If you want people to be happy you are you are you are having to overcome
4661200	4666000	Obstacles on the internet if you want people to be angry if you want people to be afraid
4667000	4670040	Every step you take it's like you're on one of those airport
4670560	4675280	conveyor belt things where every step you take takes you five steps further and
4675520	4680280	and the the left is walking against it because
4681280	4687720	Technology until we figure out a way to add a wire to the internet cables that makes you feel what the other person is feeling
4689240	4693320	We're just it's like we're in this pool together and we're just going like like oh
4693320	4696720	I want everybody happy and it kind of like touches on your thing and I
4697360	4702160	Don't know if it's a good thing to use it like we should use this as an example though because it's like you're clearly
4702320	4709200	You're you're on a blue streak. You're a charismatic amazing voice to have out there. You're a comedian that is a dedicated socialist and
4709840	4717600	maybe I'm just drunk or maybe I like you but like I it's like wow, you're a weapon in the arsenal of
4719720	4726960	Making the shit work and and yet through no one's fault really except for the way we operate versus how the enemy
4727560	4728840	operates
4728840	4733000	You you had to resign from an official position because of a joke you made
4734160	4737480	Because we can't if you're interested in equality
4738600	4740080	you can't
4740080	4747040	That doesn't merge well with the less tolerance is being used against us right now
4747040	4750200	And we're the fact that we stand for all of that
4750440	4755880	Equality and we want everything to be like fair and all of these things that they call us a snowflake for is
4756400	4762480	Absolutely being used against us particularly online and then the moment that we get as ugly as they do and go, okay
4762480	4766480	Let's let's tussle in the mud then let's get down and dirty here. They go. Oh
4767160	4770400	Look who's triggered and like, where's your tolerance now?
4770920	4775520	Like so much for the tolerant left. Look at you. You're all mad
4775520	4780740	It's so easy to trigger the you like and also you guys can't even get along with each other, right?
4781140	4783940	Look at all these women are arguing with each other about blah blah blah
4783940	4788060	Like what do you expect us to take this seriously you guys can't even stop pillow fighting about this, you know
4788060	4791780	It's just condescending like look you you're not you're not an army
4791780	4797620	well to the point specifically about my my thing I I fucked up in
4798340	4804300	Allowing ammo for that. I tweeted a thing a Bill Cosby joke that a now
4804300	4810660	I agree with people like it was right after the Weinstein thing and no woman needs to go online and see some fucking
4810660	4812820	white dudes posing with Bill Cosby star
4812820	4817220	Like I see how people would be upset and I gave them a context free
4817580	4821660	Way for everybody to get mad at me from the right to the left like, you know
4821660	4827260	Oh, you're a fucking pussy for apologizing and resigning. Oh, you know, like how dare you and and truly I
4828380	4831660	As a I'm not a politician. I thought I was a politician
4831660	4838540	I thought that I could be in this position where you're going to be judged so harshly on everything you say and everything you say
4838820	4843100	Represents this group and I made it very clear in that moment. No, I don't want to do that anymore
4843100	4850420	I don't want to have the DSA's reputation on the hook for me because I'm a comedian and I'm a writer and and so I
4850820	4854980	Inherently take certain risks and fall on my face and when I do that in front of a crowd
4855380	4857580	Forty to a hundred people don't like me
4857580	4864380	But when I do it on Twitter as the face of the DSA that could bring down the left if you know weaponized correctly
4864380	4866740	And so I see where things you know
4866940	4871300	Where it made a lot of sense for me to resign on the other side of that spectrum
4871420	4877100	Like you said if you know who I am and you know the context nobody in the local
4877420	4880860	Chapter that knows me got super upset with that
4881860	4886340	Nobody who is like my friend nobody who knows that I was making a reference to taking
4886980	4893140	Confederate statues down knows that I led a charge to get the Confederate statue taken down at Hollywood Forever Cemetery
4893460	4897740	But that's my fuckup for giving them this ammo
4897740	4901980	So we like especially within our leadership need to hold ourselves to an even higher
4902260	4907060	Standard and so what I want to do now is sort of just be a little bit more of a Steve Bannon
4907060	4913300	But good where you can help people say things and take what is the internet?
4913300	4917580	what is the internet good for I think it's good for like radicalizing and
4918300	4924140	Ideology and you see podcasts. It's bad for that too. Well, it's bad for that if it's bad ideology
4924140	4927380	It's good. It's good pure like like morally ambiguous
4928380	4930920	Radicalization whether it's for Isis or for the good guys
4931140	4937780	like the internet can do that and I think the Democrats and a big reason why I'm upset with the Democrats is that they
4938100	4944780	They won the culture war but they seeded the ideological battle for no fucking reason they got rid of Union halls
4944780	4949300	Which was the one place where people like poor people people of color
4949540	4954100	Working-class people met up and talked face-to-face and then on the internet
4954100	4958540	All it is is fucking gifts and the West Wing and Harry Potter references
4958540	4964260	There's no there's no ideology and that's what socialism and specifically for me
4964660	4971140	Democratic socialism gives me is it gives me this fuel to understand. Oh, this is happening because of this
4971220	4978660	I know because this guy that I like fucking told me this or this woman who rules taught me this thing just by watching her
4978660	4979860	Do it. Well, so, okay
4979860	4986220	So I know I know I know you're saying like first and foremost consider getting off the internet more and more
4987060	4992180	It will always be there. It runs everything you can get caught up within a moment
4992180	4996620	You could spend an entire week off of Twitter from my experience and not a lot has changed
4997260	5001620	That's not the same as telling you you're wrong for currently being on it not anything like that
5001620	5008220	It's just order tune out and stop being informed either. That's not tuning out and stopping being yeah, and and so but
5008820	5015540	However, and then there's so there's that it's like everybody experiment with like like start spending more time in the real world and blah blah blah
5017580	5020860	For those of us who are just gonna do tomorrow what we did yesterday
5020900	5026460	But but but want to put like one tag for our tag cloud one little piece of awareness
5027260	5029860	on on how we spend tomorrow and
5030860	5033600	Sadly, we're gonna spend tomorrow texting tweeting
5034100	5039600	posting reacting commenting arguing fighting getting mad getting scared
5041220	5043500	Acquiescing to that saying that's how we're gonna behave tomorrow
5044620	5050660	What's what is there some get a little algorithm some kind of little call to consciousness that?
5051060	5056140	Harms, nothing threatens. Nothing demands almost nothing just yes
5056460	5061820	Where every interaction everything you see online every way that you're reacting to it internally and every
5062500	5064500	conflict you start getting in on a
5065020	5070780	Comment section like is there some kind of so what I've done personally that's really helped me is
5071380	5074740	You you have to recognize that national media
5075380	5077020	focuses on
5077100	5082420	National story lines that you can't affect you can't change
5082820	5089460	This huge thing. So what I've done is I've stopped watching cable news cable news inherently
5089620	5094540	It's only there to scare you and make you buy, you know fucking centrum silver or whatever
5095420	5097420	And to delegitimize
5097460	5104820	Fringe voices in favor of corporate status quo. Absolutely. Where am I gonna find out whether or not I can sue somebody for
5104900	5106260	Mesothelioma
5106260	5108260	game show network, I
5108780	5113580	Mean the game show network is the only channel I watch and that's what you should do. No whammies
5113580	5118540	These fuckers want you to sue them or sue somebody for Mesothelioma. It's crazy
5118540	5122480	Are you gonna find you are you suggesting though? Cuz I it's like suggesting that people
5123180	5128620	Pay attention to Trump in in only how he can entertain you by being an idiot
5128620	5134660	Is there a way to start shifting over for all of us Facebook Twitter addicted tumblr addicted everybody like so we could
5134940	5140940	Over to local these things all have local. Yes roots and and it all starts at the local level
5140940	5146340	So if there is a DSA chapter or PSL, which is the party for socialism and liberation
5146340	5148500	There are progressive groups
5148500	5155020	If you don't have like a socialist like find the most leftmost people in your community follow groups on Twitter
5155020	5160260	Yeah, are the yes. Yeah, yeah, Los Angeles DSA, you know
5160260	5166580	And then your Twitter feed is gonna be injected with such a little bit of right. Oh the Los Feliz Boulevard
5168060	5171100	This is happening there. Yeah corner of this and that you're gonna go
5171100	5177700	Well, that's just down the block from my house exactly and that might start a kind of you might actually decide one day
5177700	5181780	You got nothing to do and like you know the address they're talking about
5181780	5186020	You know the the the shopping center that where this is happening and that right?
5186020	5193340	So so what will happen is like an account a DSA account or one of these other leftist accounts will retweet about a state bill
5193340	5198300	And a state like state bills are where power is in your state
5198300	5204060	Like we live in a country that allows a lot of states rights. There was a big fight about it a couple hundred years ago
5204580	5212260	But I generally disagree with it, but it's what we have. It's what we have and so using what we have we can
5212700	5214700	Look at at a situation
5214940	5220220	Have you have any of you ever called a state representative? Yeah a couple painted. Oh, wait. No, no
5220220	5224220	What's what that's not that's not a US not a US congressman not a senator
5225220	5230420	Right, the only people that call state senators are like, excuse me. My mailman's to to Chinese
5230420	5231420	You know what? I mean?
5231420	5236620	Like they're the craziest people in the world and there are these really important bills going through
5237060	5241980	California for example has a Medicare for all bill that's been shelved but with enough popular pressure
5242260	5245580	Could be brought back these people like when you call your state
5246060	5248020	Representatives not your national representatives
5248020	5253700	They're so happy to not be talking to a blind racist to fucking Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino
5254100	5258020	Because those are the people who call and your your efforts
5258020	5259300	You know it takes
5259300	5264840	Fucking it takes effort to go into the lunch break and look up the number and fucking because you're working all the time to find
5264840	5271380	The phone number to call for Nancy Pelosi to just ignore you or fucking Diane Feinstein to not even fucking pick up the phone
5271380	5277420	Oh, yeah, and and literally we there was somebody in LA DSA that sent a pizza with pepperoni
5277700	5281500	Spelling out like our message to them because they wouldn't there's like don't
5282220	5284780	Confirm, what's the guy that looks at the Keebler elf?
5285700	5291620	session Dennis Kucinich. Oh dating myself. Yeah, it's like, you know to get through to those people so hard
5291700	5297540	But you as an individual look at where your power lies your power lies in your community
5297540	5302480	And so if you just change the trajectory and make a call a week
5302860	5307340	About an issue that it's like look and see what state measures are going on
5307340	5310020	I'd be helpful to say your life lies at the local level
5310020	5310580	Yes
5310580	5312020	like if you
5312020	5317340	Actually become one of these people and I think we've encountered old people that we kind of we're like what's with them?
5317340	5323580	Like they're so passionate about the fucking twigs and gathering on the street corners or whatever like well become the cool version of one of those
5323660	5327940	People yeah, and you'll be following your comfort level because it's your neighborhood
5327940	5332540	And you'll also like it because I think also it's like if you're thinking the whole time
5332580	5338900	Well, I'm gonna I'm gonna hand this blanket or this taillight to this person and in so doing I'm gonna take down Trump
5338900	5341940	You're gonna get frustrated every time you come home to 900 Trump tweets
5342220	5345180	exactly and and feel like you're acting in futility, but
5346460	5351860	All right. Well goddamn. I mean one last thing if you don't go for it
5351860	5355440	And also like like fucking talk about what the Jesus
5357140	5359140	Jeff's a secret. All right
5360220	5362300	Agent, it's trying to undercut your message
5362300	5369740	I I've said this before but like the reason the tea party one is because they serve tea
5369740	5376300	They don't watch prestige television and they don't fuck like that's the reason why they want they they all they do is this
5376820	5380900	And but there are so many fewer of them than there are us
5381140	5387080	So if we just do a little bit and you can still fucking watch the deuce James Franco's surprisingly good in it
5387420	5389500	And you can still watch fucking well
5389500	5393020	You know whatever shows you want to watch or be on bumble or fucking whatever
5393260	5398240	But just like once a week just like look and see what's going on in your community and do that
5398240	5401900	And if enough of us give I mean, that's what socialism is all fucking about
5401900	5406840	It's enough of us working a little bit so that the rest of us don't have to work super fucking hard
5406940	5410420	And I think that fundamentally is the way that we need to look at the world
5410820	5416620	All right, you can go to city like public hearings and stuff to like local government
5416620	5421240	Yeah, I don't know like on NPR you always hear like oh, we're it's 7 p.m. On a Tuesday
5421240	5427180	So we're gonna take you now to the Santa Monica City Hall where a bunch of people are gonna get mad about parking and like you
5427180	5432740	Can be one of those people mad about parking and you can have a lot better ideas and it's not like well
5432740	5436460	I mean, it's the same thing about like these racist calling like the state senators
5436460	5440860	It's like the people who go there are generally crazy old people with stupid concerns
5440860	5441300	Yep
5441300	5446540	And I bet the whole lot of people are you know willing to hear reasonable concerns from less stupid people
5446540	5454220	Right and and the proof of that right now is that like through divest LA and definitely check out divest LA and public bank LA
5454780	5460420	If you live in Los Angeles and and there's great public bank movements in the Bay Area and all across the country
5461140	5464860	Like they they did exactly that they went to a local City Council
5465540	5470920	Meeting or and various local neighborhood council meetings and we're like, hey, we have this idea and it
5471580	5472660	generated enough
5472660	5480180	And this was directly in response to the pipeline shit the Dakota Access Pipeline Wells Fargo's involvement in that and what happened was
5480620	5482700	without any real like
5483380	5486660	Stalling or anything like a smooth smooth ride
5487420	5488860	the city
5488860	5496460	city council unanimously voted to divest 40 million dollars from Wells Fargo and it was just like a couple people that like
5496620	5500900	Look like us that just showed up that just showed up and we're like talking about it
5500900	5506940	And then you know, next thing you know, the world is billions of dollars better and and and that's where it counts
5507060	5513460	It turns out we have good ideas. Yeah. Well, I thought my initial instinct was okay. I'm gonna have I
5514220	5520920	Had my Eleanor Democrat on and I have my I'm gonna have the DSA and I'm gonna have antifa on I'm never gonna have a Nazi on
5520920	5525940	I I but but you know much as I met Spencer by asking is there a dungeon master here?
5525940	5532980	I feel like you're you know, you were not being indoctrinated in any cult or or political party when we talk about
5533580	5538900	acting locally and all this right and and you're very charismatic and and and and
5539540	5545860	Unthreatening, um, you're definitely de coagulating my defense mechanisms and therefore let's say you're LA based, right?
5545860	5547780	Yeah, let's have you back
5547780	5555140	sooner than later because let's start the conversation at like what should we do like like locally because then like
5555300	5561060	Locally can mean locally everywhere that everyone's watching and it doesn't Jesus Christ. He's really trying
5561500	5563220	He hates progress
5563220	5567780	Love symbols, but and so let's give us one more time. I guess maybe
5568300	5574740	The website if people want to just yeah, I mean DSA USA org is the national website
5574740	5576740	You can follow DSA on Twitter
5576740	5580820	On DSA LA is DSA dash LA org
5580820	5584460	But I encourage you I'm not here to tell you just to join the DSA
5584460	5589900	There's those are the people that I found that most importantly because I think the biggest thing that's gonna trigger people is like
5589900	5592820	We're we're not we're not Bernie bro and necessarily here
5592820	5595820	No, and there are people that are you know, okay
5595820	5603020	so what the thing that made me join is I went with a friend of mine to a meeting right after the election and I
5603020	5604340	was like
5604340	5605780	You know, I'll give these guys a shot
5605780	5611260	let's see what happens and I saw a bunch of fucking white dudes with glasses and various forms of facial hair that look like
5611260	5616140	They listen to podcasts all the time and I was like, okay. Okay. It's like a bunch of guys like me or whatever and then
5617140	5623980	The the person that was leading the meeting the chair at the time was this amazing witchy old woman named Carol
5623980	5625980	Who I love who is like one of the greatest women
5626860	5635540	In the history of politics. She flipped over a bus during an anti-vietnam protest and just kept the seat warm because baby was under it
5635540	5641900	Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's why she had the magic of the power. I don't approve of female strength on physical level
5641900	5643900	no, no, no, she's a regular she-hulk and
5644660	5646660	She so she
5647060	5653100	She said like, okay, who's here who doesn't really necessarily vibe with DSA
5653100	5654420	But it's just here for you know
5654420	5660180	Just to see what's up and this guy came up and he was like I'm a Democrat and I am NOT gonna change that at
5660180	5663380	Anytime he's like an older man and he was like, I just want to be
5663940	5668780	Somewhere and with a group of people that can help point me in the right way to help change the Democratic Party
5669020	5674020	Is it okay if I'm in here and and there were like kinda like Snickers like, you know
5674020	5679000	A little bit and then Carol walks up and goes now, I'm sure a lot of you disagree with this tactic
5679000	5681340	I'm sure a lot of you disagree with
5681900	5686740	working within the Democratic Party and we're like nodding our heads and she's like how many of you are willing to do the
5686740	5692660	Work that he's gonna do in the Democratic Party and we were all like not me and she's like, right
5693020	5696140	So we have a big tent where it's called a big tent
5696540	5705020	organization where if no matter what your level involvement is no matter what your politics are if you want to help locally on issues that I
5705420	5707420	guarantee you you agree with
5707740	5710980	Everything from like hey, maybe we shouldn't put spikes under
5712100	5715940	Overpasses so homeless people can't live in under our precious overpasses
5716460	5719260	Mitchell Farrell City Councilman person of Los Angeles
5720300	5722300	like
5722300	5728020	You you'll find that and then beyond that you'll be able to find like we don't just we're not an amorphous blob
5728020	5731620	We have our Housing and Homelessness Committee, which is focused on doing things like
5732980	5740140	Streetwatch which cops go and illegally fuck up homeless encampments people that have a job and a computer and a phone and are
5740180	5742420	Right there ready to get a fucking apartment
5742420	5745700	They'll go in and bust all their shit and break all their shit completely illegally
5745700	5747700	So we have a couple people who are comfortable
5748060	5753660	Waking up at four in the morning when we have a Google number gets called and says there's a sweep coming and they just stand
5753660	5757420	There with their phones and they just videotape and the cops don't fuck with people
5757420	5761820	So like if that interests you you can do that if you're into health care if you're into
5762340	5765500	Prison abolition who's doing a lot of great work with our mutual aid
5765620	5768900	Group on the taillight benefit like all of there's all these different
5768900	5774180	just maybe if what you're really good at is sitting in your in front of your computer and
5774420	5779340	Following your kind of anger and outrage and trolling people there might even be a job for you
5779380	5780780	Yeah, that actually ends it
5780780	5784420	You know, you can use those skills if you want to feel like you're fucking with you know
5784420	5787500	What's the best thing in the world fucking real-life trolling?
5787580	5793620	We ruined Mayor Garcetti's election party because he was capitulating with Trump and not
5794340	5798900	He wasn't calling the Los Angeles a sanctuary city, which by the way, it's still fucking isn't
5799380	5804060	And so he was letting our because he wants the Olympics so fucking bad
5804060	5808460	He was letting the cops work hand-in-hand with ice and fuck people over
5808460	5814060	There was this big story that I'm not sure if you remember in Highland Park where a dude was literally dropping his daughter off
5814140	5820500	He had a DUI 40 years ago. It's the only crime he ever committed and he was just snatched and one of the first ones
5820500	5824660	Yeah, Romulo was his name and he luckily because of public pressure was let out
5824660	5831180	But in in response to this we used our anger and we found out well shit the mayor is getting elected
5831580	5836140	In what is gonna be a landslide might as well be running on a post. He's throwing a big party
5836140	5840100	It's a boring election with a lot of press. Let's go fuck it up
5840100	5845260	And so a hundred of us showed up and started yelling about getting ice out of Los Angeles
5845260	5848300	And we had people infiltrate and interrupt his speech
5848300	5852300	And then what ended up happening was people that worked for the mayor came out to us
5852420	5856300	Like during the party like kind of were like hey keep doing stuff like this
5856300	5858620	Please because we never get pressure from the left
5858620	5864140	It's always pressure from the right and so we kept pressuring on and granted this wasn't our idea
5864140	5871940	We had groups like that organize undocumented people that are on the front lines who can't go be so fucking
5872540	5878500	Confrontational with the mayor but we as a group of mostly white people can use our privilege to amplify
5878700	5884220	Their voices and put ourselves in the way of jail time which they're not gonna arrest a bunch of fucking white people
5884220	5886220	Like that's just not how cops work
5886220	5890260	And so we yelled at me yelled at me yelled at me yelled in two weeks later
5890300	5897400	He passed special order 40 which makes it so that no Los Angeles city official can
5897980	5905020	Collaborate with ice right and it's like that's trolling that fucking works. That's just you big. We literally did the Simpsons
5906260	5908260	Eric
5908500	5911740	Well, he was getting his fucking makeup on and and it was fun
5911740	5914820	And there may be people out there that don't they're like, well, I don't want to do that
5914820	5916320	I don't want to be a troll and all that stuff
5916320	5921980	But and so there's but there's my point is like low-income women rides to abortion clinics because people do that, too
5921980	5927500	There's every personality. It's like when you start when you have when you run a TV show you go like there's there's people who love
5927860	5932180	Writing fanfic like 500 pages of what-if stuff
5932180	5937100	There's people who just who hate those people but they can love the same TV show
5937100	5941500	I'm translating this into my own fucking narcissistic thing is that is the
5942100	5945780	So anyways, I hate to I don't want to be the guy that cuts off the guy
5945780	5948640	That's like passionate and is like doing good by talking
5948640	5953460	So but we're if we cut into D&D time will be under cutting the entire DSA
5956060	5961380	But but but let's I mean let's resolve that like whether it's like a segment you come back for 10 minutes of
5961940	5965680	per show or whatever and like like help me like
5966280	5968280	reform myself as a locally active
5969800	5975120	Person I'm too drunk. I'm making too many promises, but but but but something where we have you back very soon
5975120	5979040	like I really appreciate your willingness it's in
5979720	5983960	especially in light of how you know just hearing about your recent like kind of
5984520	5989340	Brush up against the the PC thing and how that must fucking suck for somebody that just wants to be
5989820	5990860	I
5990860	5996860	You're you're a hero to me because you clearly care about this stuff enough to keep like plunging along
5997500	5999500	And actually saying this shit
6000140	6006940	The movement's more important than me. Yeah, and so ultimately the reason that I resigned is it was like I don't want to be a weight
6006940	6008940	That's a threshold. I'd love to cross
6009060	6011460	And maybe maybe you can help me in the way I'm like, you know
6012060	6016620	And like help me like stay positive instead of negative and stuff. But so let's
6017420	6018620	Go
6018620	6022140	Thank you, Josh and Droski for coming by we'll see you again soon and
6029140	6031140	Thank you for dressing like Spencer
6040060	6042920	Yeah, and just again he's not officially
6044060	6045820	spokesperson for the DSA
6045820	6051980	He just they they again didn't step up to the plate if it gets your dander up. There might be a couple
6053980	6056220	I'm a harm in town fan. I don't I
6057100	6062980	Delineate that from politics. So what I don't like is for my harm in town episode to be entirely about
6064260	6065820	politics I
6065820	6068700	Sure, I sympathize with that. I would submit to you
6068700	6075540	I do not know what harm in town is supposed to be which is why sometimes it is something that you find amazing
6075820	6078980	and I think there are probably some people that are
6079180	6080940	orgasming right now because we finally
6080940	6084580	We walked the walk a little bit in terms of a booking and like holy shit
6084580	6089280	That was a that was a signal to boost I think because I've been babbling or forever about
6089820	6092380	Acting locally and all this shit and I don't know how to do it
6092380	6092660	Yeah
6092660	6098620	And so making a friend that actually knows how to walk that walk is important to me and what's important to me should be important
6098620	6101020	To you. So fuck you Julie
6101620	6106020	Yeah, Julie with your joint dangling from your mouth thinking
6107620	6111340	Harm in town so great, but only when he raps about fucking my mama
6112580	6115260	Is Steve leaving here tonight? No, which is why
6116940	6118940	We need to replace him with
6118940	6120940	a
6126460	6130620	Spring wrap shop back up Rob. Oh, yeah
6137580	6141620	He put a chair on the stage he's rolling about
6143260	6147900	Rob since you have wheels go get our character sheets for us. So yeah
6148540	6153060	Right, right shop is going to dev Ross's way across our state
6159940	6162140	Rob shop is nothing if not a showman
6164180	6168640	Rob shop gathering up our character sheets gonna hand in
6171860	6172780	And
6172820	6178620	Just a side note if you want to join the D and DSA you can roll your character sheet
6178620	6184300	We're using standard point by arrays and oh man. I have some psionic classes are off the table
6184300	6188260	I have an exciting thing to talk to you about role-playing wise. Uh-huh. So this guy
6189540	6191540	Who I talked to for I?
6191780	6197620	Guess probably a hot Adderall vodka induced hour and a half or so following one of our shows
6198540	6205780	And I was just talking about that Blacksburg Technical Research Center game space-time and time lords
6206540	6209340	Remember I babbled to you about that like this role-playing game that I
6210020	6215860	Anyways, he where you're playing yourself. He yes. Okay, where you play? So this is a system where you
6216860	6222100	Approximate your own real life attributes. It's Rob gonna play Steve is Rob playing diarrhea
6222100	6226300	I mean, he'll do whatever he wants regardless of what anyone attempts
6228620	6235220	If you haven't paid $5 a month for our subscription you're missing out on one of life's great treasures
6235220	6240300	This has mostly been a non-visual show, but these these couple of minutes are certainly a
6241300	6248180	Phenomenon unto itself. I'm really worried. He's gonna hurt himself like he's just gonna roll off the off the stage
6248180	6249780	I hope that happens
6249780	6255540	Okay, but like one that's the thing about a rolling chair on a platform like one wheel goes off the edge
6255540	6257860	And I don't care if you're Jackie Chan. You're
6258780	6260780	You're dead
6263700	6268640	But why are you're on the side of that, you know, all right, let's have fun so I'm gonna die so Spencer
6270100	6274060	Rob are you gonna play the role of Steve Levy? Yeah, what do you want to do Rob?
6274900	6276900	Sure
6277980	6282580	What a non-player character and I'll be a non-player character cuz
6283580	6287980	I'd like where you just appointed you came to the you come to the show and then there's a guy. It's like
6289180	6296540	Talking politics and you're like, oh I'm not gonna come anymore. What are you talking about? I'm like sharing my insecurities
6296540	6300780	Yeah, we want to know what you're feeling. I like it when you show up. You're I'm sorry
6302780	6307220	Had a rough couple of days. Oh, wait, wait, what do you mean? Why what? Yeah, let's talk about that
6307220	6314480	I'll tell you about later, but it's not I'm fine. There's a lolly's sake. No, it's Kate's. No, no, no
6321420	6324860	Okay, it could be what let's act it out
6325460	6327020	Okay
6327020	6330260	It's your boss out of breath from doing all that leg
6330260	6335380	I was out of breath from dancing and then I had to start rapping and I was like, man, I can't even fucking breathe
6336340	6338340	It's a bummer. Yeah
6338700	6341180	What a life this mic is
6342780	6349320	Quieter than the others. Well, it's because when you put the genius thing is that the oh because it's me
6349500	6351840	Well, no, this yeah the streamers
6352500	6356520	It's like we're it's it's unmistakably a live performance
6356660	6362180	But then when you listen to it and I have like then this goes to Zach and Chris like I mean
6362180	6368980	They're walking a fucking crazy tightrope. They're recording streaming live audio that it that when you listen back to it
6368980	6373720	It sounds like a real podcast episode like it's not compromised by the fact that we're doing it at a warehouse
6374300	6377460	but I think as performers we benefit from
6378180	6381620	Visually from being in this space as opposed to the audio booth
6381620	6386900	Thank you for bringing it up so I can give props to our amazing engineers. I have a little bit of a
6387620	6391500	Business housekeeping question. Okay, who farted? I don't know
6392540	6394540	when oh
6394740	6396340	recently
6396340	6400620	Do you think it was Josh and Drosky from the GSA or your girlfriend?
6403140	6408140	This is a present fart no, it wasn't me because the minute you started going I
6408980	6412480	Okay, I'd like to ask a question. I almost said who oh
6413120	6416680	Well, it had to be Josh that cuz I didn't smell anything so it had to be Josh
6416880	6422480	It's either Jeff at an incredible. No. Yeah, it's not a werewolf game. I feel like it's gotta be
6428240	6434440	Using my werewolf skills that always get me taken out within the third round I think that yeah, I think Jeff did
6435560	6437560	I'm not accusing you
6438400	6445560	Even more old-world rules than that whoever smelt it dealt it I believe and whoever denied it supplied it if I'm not mistaken
6454280	6459840	No, we should but I just I'm just thinking about the options and in my head it's got to be one of you two
6460920	6466820	Well, if it was me, it'd be really obvious. Well, that's cuz I you were rolling around crop dusting
6467560	6471780	I didn't I swear to God. I know that's why it's too obvious to be you. That's why I think
6476440	6482280	I don't know if it's a fart because it keeps on rolling cuz like as you can be like a Burbank thing
6482280	6485640	Yeah, I mean as you've been talking it's the water sanitation
6490440	6494360	Just like the shop was rolling around the stage. Yeah, but I didn't
6495160	6500720	They start making the farts I don't bank like early like the early shift that might be it
6500720	6504700	So then you can get your fresh Burbank farts. I swear to God it was 6 a.m
6507760	6512200	Do you remember the tannery I was just in Milwaukee, yeah
6514040	6517080	How was the how was the the the college talk?
6518160	6523520	My art school talk was great life-changing. Did you like man's intro? Did you use it? Yes, I did
6525360	6530760	No, he's a nice one. He's the only not a topping one. Yeah. Well, that's I mean we
6532280	6537640	They weren't a failure they were just a different tape the rapper he rhymed bukkake. No, no
6538640	6542120	None of the rest. He was the verbal one the verbal one
6542120	6546280	This guy is gonna swivel in a chair and tell me he didn't fart on me. I did not
6548520	6550520	Guilty
6551120	6555000	You would know because I'd be going I don't know what you're talking about
6559400	6560840	Florida
6560840	6562960	As if they didn't have enough troubles
6564160	6569480	Sometimes their tap water is just smells like a fart like I like outside my hotel
6570720	6574120	Like what's that fart smell and then my parents be like, well, that's just tied
6574120	6577720	You know tide comes in goes out when it goes out leaves dead stuff Milwaukee
6577720	6582240	We're no stranger that the Dettiel lives there. They smell like rotting fish that tannery
6583480	6590080	but the tap water like I was brushing my teeth one morning and then I brush my teeth and then I go in and I
6590720	6594780	Cup and I slurp my rinsing water out of the tap. What?
6595720	6599240	Yeah, is this like the standing wiper thing? I'm gonna find out I do this
6599240	6603040	We have ten minutes to play D&D. So Spencer you went you went our catches up
6603800	6605040	Yeah
6605040	6606320	honestly
6606320	6610560	What happened you guys Dan? Do you remember anything that happened? I remember fighting the zombies
6611040	6614020	As we just got to the town of Ember Ember shot
6614320	6620860	Yeah, I think what happened is you were just on the cusp of the town of Bembershot, which whose name will be revealed
6622320	6624320	Great I
6624680	6626680	Remember we fought the zombies
6627360	6632680	We were successful in fighting them in the sense that they either ran away or were killed
6632680	6637080	Yeah, that was all that happened right because you set up that you were outside of the town
6637080	6641680	Yeah, that's what was confusing as I was like didn't more happen and the answer was no
6642200	6644200	so last time
6644600	6651240	Y'all found some zombies. There was music coming from a harp and it was it kind of made the zombies
6652480	6658080	Bummed out it was bum. It there was music bumming out the zombies and skeletons in a graveyard and
6658560	6665960	diarrhea jr. Went to investigate the sound that was a the music sound and when he did there was a burst of ruby light and
6666120	6672300	Then the music stopped and as if on cue the zombies stopped being all bummed out and started
6672520	6674000	Well, just being you know
6674000	6681820	Generally mindless zombies trying to end all life as we know it and you guys as clerics and members of the church
6682080	6684720	militants fought them and killed them
6685520	6687520	That was that was it yeah
6687880	6692000	Combat takes a long time. Yeah. All right. So where are we standing right now?
6692320	6693880	You're outside of the graveyard
6693880	6700520	You're standing over the white ashes of the the skeleton that you cut down with your flame blade
6700840	6706160	Spell all right. That was a fucking flame blade. Yeah, that was what a Chad did
6706920	6709600	So zombies no more music
6710040	6712040	No more zombies
6713040	6717400	Well nighttime looks like we got here either just in time or

6819120	6824300	Terrific. I'm gonna now what are we gonna do? I'm gonna play what are we doing one of those war movie things where it's like
6824300	6827360	He's it's like a PTSD thing and I'm like gonna cradle him and go
6828000	6836360	Hey, hey, hey, hey, listen to me man. You got to look at me. This world is magical a lot of that magic is dark
6837800	6844720	Right. I've been through pain. I was raised by pain. We all met through a church that church ain't perfect
6844720	6848960	We're here to clean up this town. I can't even remember where the fuck we're here
6850400	6852400	That's a great question to ask
6852920	6858320	It was because of the we're on the quest of patches of Patcheons Jeff a
6860680	6868600	Third-party Linux quest that wasn't approved of well, it was approved of well. Yeah, I don't open-source quest
6868600	6870600	Yeah, I don't want to get into the minutia
6874320	6876320	The quest for Patcheons gem
6877320	6883200	Yeah Patcheons who was your good friend and helped you out in don't Roan he
6883640	6890020	He got robbed. Yeah in part because you guys let him get stabbed a bunch and we feel guilty about that
6890020	6895040	So we're gonna go get this gem. We're gonna get the gem. Do you have to kill some zombies along the way? Yes
6895920	6897920	Yes
6898680	6900680	The pedal
6900720	6907240	I'm going you guys are I'm gonna start looking I'm gonna right. I'm walking. I'm walking away
6907880	6914680	I'll figure it out. I'll find it. I feel so bad about this, but I don't remember if Patcheons is with us Patcheons is here
6914680	6917320	Yeah, he didn't he was kind of quiet in that last fight guys
6917320	6923400	Here's his interactions has been overtly critical of our ability to help him in the past and we are not we've proven him
6923400	6928740	Right. I feel like you put me in a position where honesty implies brutal criticality
6928740	6932620	I don't know that I want to be in those situations saying to my party members
6932620	6936500	I'm going guys if the goal is to give me make Patcheons
6938520	6940200	I
6940200	6947700	Think our goal is let's let's keep it simple. Let's let's help Patcheons out. Let's do one thing, right?
6948680	6950680	passions
6950760	6952760	I have an idea. Okay
6953640	6959600	Here's the thing. We just got to a new town. There's no direct like linear mission. I think what we should do
6960560	6962760	Is we the only people that have seen us together?
6965200	6967200	Zombies they're dead. They've fled
6968320	6973400	We should do that thing like in the beginning of the third the the return of the Jedi
6973800	6977200	Okay, we show up one by one in this town
6978160	6980160	Wait for everybody to take a nap
6981520	6986400	Do well don't start like let's not get sidetracked by our critical grievances with that movie
6986440	6991840	But but but I'm just saying like their strategy was just like we just we don't come in together. We don't go
6991840	6994760	Hey, we're the Rebel Alliance. We're here to free Han Solo
6994760	7001360	All right, right we we we just show up in different guys's just disguising and we and we don't acknowledge
7001360	7004080	The only rule is we just don't acknowledge that we know each other
7004480	7008240	The one rule is that we don't acknowledge that we know each other
7008240	7013460	We don't acknowledge that we know each hill until it's time time to to make
7014120	7015720	shit
7015720	7017720	Happen. Hey, I came back
7018360	7023780	Oh, right. He was off mic. Hi, so we're gonna go into town
7024440	7032000	Let's let's give 10 minute waits between each of us entering town. I'll go first. Okay. Good diarrhea you going first
7032360	7039260	I'll go first. Bye. Yeah, just and just you don't know my hands up. You don't know us
7042720	7048080	And all you're gonna do is just you don't have an agenda you're not on any kind of case should I go to a store
7048560	7054880	Sure, you could go to the saloon. I'll go to the saloon store. Just try to ingratiate yourself with locals
7055880	7061160	All right, the Sun begins to rise as you see the outer wall of door take a
7061600	7064860	Beer that's the name of the town the outer wall
7065680	7068600	The wall is thick and only about 10 feet high
7068600	7073000	But it's like make it's mostly like a big pile of like lumber and dirt and stuff
7073000	7074280	It's kind of like a beaver dam
7074280	7079360	It's just kind of like a big a big mess of a big thick wall kind of surrounding the city
7079360	7085120	It has a bit of breaks racing structure and kind of like a bit on top that you walk on that's more flat
7085160	7089080	But it's just kind of like a giant barricade surrounding the whole town
7089320	7092400	You're you're in front of the gate and there's two guards
7092400	7094000	Well, they they seem like they're guards
7094000	7100840	But they're not wearing uniforms or anything and they're sitting on top of the gate you look at them and you could tell they're sleeping
7100840	7102920	They're sleeping on the job in the morning
7104040	7106040	Hey
7106720	7108040	Hey
7108080	7114760	They slowly wake up as if out of a stupor and they they're squinting in the sunlight and looking around they

7189760	7194320	We just want to we want to cast a wide net because I feel like our mission is infiltration
7194320	7197120	I mean, I I walk up at 10 minutes later
7197120	7203340	I walk up to the to the guards and I go hey, could you guys let me in? No, they wake up

7238280	7242800	All right, yeah, it's very easy to sneak past the sleeping guards
7242800	7246400	It's it's it's about like 9 in the morning, and they're still sleeping
7246760	7250680	You don't know they seem like they might have slept through the night shift. I

7308920	7315120	And the other one he he holds his spear down and the spear is like holding a bucket that you can put the money into hmm
7315960	7321080	Interesting how weapons are adapted to commerce in times of peace
7323800	7327320	The guard falls asleep and the bucket fall on the ground well

7398440	7404760	We're not on record with sleeping guards is coming as a group. That's important. Yeah, I think as far as they're concerned
7404760	7409400	We were three different people. I think we should still now take advantage of that fact that
7410240	7414920	As far as the record shows a group of church officials never came to this town
7415120	7418360	You know right, so we can now spread out
