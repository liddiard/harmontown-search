0	13000	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Harman Town, how do you feel tonight?
13000	18000	Oh my goodness, so good to see you all.
18000	21000	Let's get right into it, we don't need a lot of fanfare.
21000	28000	In the hands of the air, his name is Dan Harman.
28000	33000	And his friend's name, King of the Game, Mr. Rob Schwab.
33000	54000	Flowers bloom for you, friends in Johnson,
55000	62000	In the spring and every season,
62000	69000	But your mama so hard, the gaper leaves,
69000	76000	And the tumbleweeds and the pollen and the honeybees
77000	84000	Are all flying around, eating cheese.
84000	91000	Damn, I remember the one time,
91000	99000	Damn, I remember that other time,
99000	104000	Damn, I remember all the times,
104000	109000	I got photographic, recall,
109000	112000	And it's wasted on me.
112000	115000	What?
115000	119000	Sorry, I...
119000	123000	Oh, but what about it?
123000	127000	Just sayin' you don't have no all-timers at all.
128000	130000	I think I got that.
130000	133000	These two can remember shit.
133000	142000	Time for me to turn into a squirrel.
142000	148000	Damn, I'm a squirrel.
148000	156000	Leaping from branch to branch, foreshadowing primates.
156000	161000	Slowly, my eyes will move to the front of my head,
161000	166000	So I can have depth perception.
166000	172000	And I'll get color vision, so I can recognize ripe fruit.
172000	178000	Oh, damn, damn, my tail's going away.
178000	181000	I'm climbing down from the tree,
181000	185000	And I'm living in an alarmist community
185000	189000	Where we groom each other and pound our chests
189000	193000	And look out for the spotted leopards
193000	196000	And if one comes, we go,
196000	197000	Ah, ah!
197000	202000	And we all climb up in a tree.
202000	203000	Damn.
203000	206000	Damn.
206000	208000	Damn, indeed.
208000	211000	Very good, Dan Harmon.
211000	217000	You may live another day,
217000	222000	So Pyramid Hand decrees it.
222000	223000	Ah!
223000	224000	Oh, God.
224000	225000	Quick.
225000	228000	While he's either blind or...
228000	234000	There's only one man who can save Pyramid Man.
234000	237000	There's only one man who can save Pyramid Man.
237000	243000	And that man's name is Jeff Davis!
243000	246000	Oh, he's getting serious.
246000	248000	Hello, everybody.
248000	249000	Welcome back, Jeff.
249000	250000	Hello.
250000	251000	Welcome back to me.
251000	253000	Welcome back to you.
253000	254000	Okay.
254000	255000	Well, thank you.
255000	256000	Thank you.
256000	257000	Thank you.
257000	258000	Thank you.
258000	259000	Thank you.
259000	260000	Thank you.
260000	261000	Thank you.
261000	262000	Thank you.
262000	263000	Thank you.
263000	264000	Thank you.
264000	265000	Thank you.
266000	270000	We're kind of playing with the show format here.
270000	272000	I didn't want Brandon to go away.
272000	273000	Jeff's back.
273000	276000	Spencer's still gone.
276000	278000	Thoughts and prayers.
278000	283000	I will say, certainly, if he's going through anything,
283000	285000	it's not affecting his work.
285000	291000	I've seen four animatics of Harmon Quest.
291000	292000	Very good season.
292000	294000	Probably best season ever.
294000	299000	Looking forward to that.
299000	305000	Maybe he's content to just focus on that.
305000	306000	And I'm here.
306000	309000	Yeah.
309000	310000	Who needs Spencer?
310000	311000	Who needs anybody?
311000	312000	Who needs Spencer?
312000	316000	I've been up all night, so I'll probably fall asleep tonight,
316000	322000	but I've been working, and so I'm a little out of it.
322000	323000	What are you working on?
323000	327000	A screenplay that was due a million years ago
327000	330000	and just finishing it up.
330000	332000	It's just about finished.
332000	335000	This is for Aquaman 3, right?
335000	337000	It's in that area.
337000	339000	Dr. Stranger.
346000	349000	Who knows?
349000	352000	Who's strange?
352000	355000	I was thinking about Green Arrow today.
355000	361000	Dr. Stranger.
361000	366000	Is he called Green Arrow because he's new at it?
366000	369000	Green Arrow.
369000	374000	Well, I'm not the best Arrow guy here.
374000	377000	I'm still new.
377000	382000	You're going to need to get your uniform before you start talking to management.
382000	384000	You knew Green Arrow.
384000	388000	It may be a different Arrow, but you knew Green Arrow.
388000	389000	Green Lantern?
389000	392000	I thought you were on my side.
392000	396000	Just because we green don't mean we are green.
396000	397000	Green Arrow and...
397000	398000	Is this helping?
398000	399000	Is this helping?
399000	400000	Yeah, yeah.
400000	401000	Is this helping?
401000	404000	Green Lantern, they were partnered up in a series of comic books
404000	405000	that were critically acclaimed.
405000	407000	I can't imagine why.
407000	413000	Maybe it was because people liked watching the Green Lantern feel awkward.
413000	416000	It's like, dude, what is your origin story?
416000	421000	You played Peter Pan in high school and hit your head?
421000	422000	He just shoots dumb arrows.
422000	423000	That's all he does.
423000	428000	Perhaps my boxing glove arrow will punch this up a bit.
428000	433000	Perhaps my screwdriver arrow will turn things around.
433000	434000	Okay, none of that works.
434000	437000	Perhaps my exploding arrow will blow you up.
437000	441000	Just use your exploding arrow every time, Green Arrow.
441000	445000	Don't waste your time making all these arrows.
445000	446000	What do you...
446000	448000	Think of just budgeting your time.
448000	449000	You're not getting them back.
449000	450000	You're not getting them back.
450000	452000	Yeah, I mean, just once you...
452000	453000	You're not getting them back.
453000	456000	You shoot them and what is he going to do?
456000	459000	He's like, hey, guys, wait a second.
459000	462000	Before you jump into the car and drive back,
462000	465000	I got to go pick up my fucking arrows.
465000	468000	Otherwise, I'm not equipped.
468000	469000	I'm not a comic book guy.
469000	473000	Does he conjure them up or does he actually fabricate them for the purpose?
473000	474000	He tinkers.
474000	477000	He's like part tinkerer, part archer.
477000	478000	How is that?
478000	481000	He makes his arrows in a workshop.
481000	482000	Right.
482000	485000	Is anybody a Green Arrow aficionado that...
485000	486000	Like Batman with arrows.
486000	487000	Right.
487000	488000	So he is, right?
488000	489000	Is he a metahuman?
489000	490000	No.
490000	491000	Oh, really?
491000	492000	See, that's kind of interesting,
492000	495000	because how many other non-metahumans are there?
495000	496000	Like, not a lot, right?
496000	498000	At least two.
498000	501000	So does he have a Green Arrow car?
501000	502000	Yes.
502000	504000	What is it called?
504000	506000	It's like the Aeromobile or something.
506000	507000	We had...
507000	509000	The Rick and Morty staff were kind of like
509000	514000	very delicately vandalizing the Green Arrow Wikipedia one season.
514000	516000	They kept adding, like, really...
516000	517000	Because we were trying to see, like,
517000	520000	how long can the shit just, like, seep into canon?
520000	522000	Because you really don't know.
522000	525000	I mean, the shit gets ridiculous,
525000	527000	because, like, Green Arrow's been around forever.
527000	529000	There was a run of Green Arrow
529000	532000	where his sidekick Speedy had a heroin addiction.
532000	536000	You wouldn't be able to tell at a glance.
536000	538000	Why did Speedy have a heroin addiction?
538000	539000	Yeah.
539000	541000	You would think he would have, like, a meth addiction.
541000	544000	Yeah, yeah.
544000	545000	That's meta.
545000	547000	But there was this whole thing...
547000	551000	We went too far at one point, and everybody got busted.
551000	553000	Did they come to your house and go...
553000	554000	No.
554000	555000	Hey, you know...
555000	559000	Some Green Arrow fan, like, expunged the whole thing.
559000	561000	It was slowly building.
561000	563000	There was, like, this whole thing about this, like,
563000	567000	really meticulous grievance between Green Arrow and...
567000	568000	someone else.
568000	571000	And part of it was he thought that...
571000	573000	It started with the Green Arrow mobile
573000	577000	and how he thought that this person had scratched it
577000	579000	and wouldn't admit it.
579000	583000	And then that was, like, threaded into, like, different, like...
583000	586000	infinite crisis and whatever,
586000	589000	and kind of, like, this long-standing grudge
589000	593000	with this other DC character that he was convinced had scratched his car.
593000	595000	Yeah.
595000	598000	Yeah, I mean, essentially, Dan, you're telling me a story
598000	600000	about something that was funny once.
600000	603000	It's not really gonna be funny again.
603000	605000	I understand.
605000	607000	I haven't slept in a while.
607000	611000	Here, so, you've been doing some DC research.
611000	612000	Yeah.
612000	614000	The C-shirt research.
614000	616000	I'm trying to...
616000	618000	to mind pushing them together, but...
618000	619000	Okay, so Green...
619000	621000	Yeah, I learned all about red tornado today.
621000	622000	D-search.
622000	623000	D-search.
623000	624000	D-search.
624000	626000	Green Lantern's weakness.
626000	628000	Is anything made of yellow?
628000	629000	Is that...
629000	630000	Purple?
630000	631000	Yellow?
631000	633000	Well, it goes through different things, like the...
633000	635000	Like yield signs?
635000	637000	It used to be wood.
637000	639000	He couldn't affect wood.
639000	641000	He doesn't affect mine.
641000	642000	So if you were like...
642000	644000	So you could...
644000	646000	Hello!
646000	650000	But, yeah, there's some stuff with the yellow.
650000	654000	But it's more about the yellow lantern energy
654000	655000	or something like that.
655000	657000	Green Lantern is such a turn-off to me.
657000	658000	I can't...
658000	659000	I think the only...
659000	666000	I like what the Lego DC stuff does with the Green Lantern powers,
666000	667000	because...
667000	668000	Whatevs.
668000	671000	You're not gonna get any smiles out of me.
671000	673000	I guess because it's kind of like four kids
673000	675000	and then it's through the Lego filter.
675000	678000	It sort of makes a character whose power is just to
678000	680000	make up random shit.
680000	682000	Like, they kind of...
682000	685000	They can contain it within these translucent green blocks
685000	686000	and whatever.
686000	688000	But just that idea of like,
688000	692000	oh, I'm gonna use my imagination to make a green baseball glove.
692000	694000	Like, so dumb.
694000	695000	Isn't it cheating?
695000	696000	Kill yourself.
696000	698000	I've never seen any of the Lego films.
698000	702000	But the whole point of Lego is that
702000	705000	it's stationary blocks of shit that you stick together.
705000	706000	But then they're all...
706000	708000	Their mouths are moving and their faces are moving
708000	712000	and they're doing all this shit that breaks the Lego rule.
712000	713000	Right?
714000	715000	They should be...
715000	719000	They should be a little blocky, stiff, like, you know...
719000	721000	They are in the...
721000	723000	Yeah, but their faces are all fucking...
723000	725000	All over the joint, like, you know...
725000	729000	Well, it'd be kind of a boring movie if...
729000	730000	Yeah, yes.
730000	732000	So don't make it out of Lego.
732000	734000	Make it out of anything else.
734000	735000	All right.
735000	736000	Make...
736000	737000	They should have did that.
737000	738000	They would have been famous.
738000	739000	Here's a pitch.
739000	742000	The Play-Doh movie.
742000	744000	You can make whatever you want out of Play-Doh.
744000	747000	How about the Playmobile movie that's coming out?
747000	748000	How about...
748000	752000	Have you seen the DC Universe's Lincoln Log movie coming out?
752000	754000	It's all made out of logs.
754000	756000	I'd watch that, Dan.
756000	757000	That's stupid.
758000	759000	All right.
759000	761000	We're getting into bad territory for me.
761000	763000	I remember a guy from Hot Wheels or Mattel
763000	766000	or something like that was, like, touring the studio,
766000	767000	the animation studio.
767000	768000	And they were like,
768000	772000	Yeah, if you guys can think of anything to do with Hot Wheels,
772000	773000	that'd be cool.
773000	780000	And, you know, it's tough because you can't just put, like,
780000	785000	a face on the front of the car because Pixar did that.
785000	786000	It's like this.
786000	787000	The toy.
787000	789000	The toy is like a car, but, you know,
789000	790000	and there's no driver.
790000	792000	Fuck! Fuck!
792000	797000	It was like watching a guy realize Hot Wheels is a shitty property.
797000	800000	Here's something.
800000	803000	You don't have to make a movie out of everything.
803000	805000	No one's going to go...
805000	808000	He's got to make a movie out of Hot Wheels or he's fucking fired.
808000	810000	Somebody's not going to go,
810000	813000	Okay, we just did zebras.
813000	814000	All right.
814000	816000	There's a movie for everything now.
816000	818000	We can close up shop Hollywood.
818000	820000	There's a movie for everything.
820000	823000	I was just attached to the new Connect Four movie.
823000	826000	I play Blue.
826000	827000	Oh, man.
827000	828000	You...
828000	830000	It is so...
830000	833000	We had, like, a dalliance with the Play-Doh movie.
833000	835000	The Play-Doh people wanted to...
835000	836000	They got a...
836000	839000	We did a joke of it on Community.
839000	840000	I know.
840000	842000	And then we were talking to the Play-Doh people and...
842000	844000	Paul Feig's supposed to be directing.
844000	846000	I was really excited about our idea.
846000	847000	I love your grumpy.
847000	848000	What?
848000	850000	I just love our grumpy.
850000	852000	Paul Feig's supposed to be directing now.
852000	856000	We are orbiting an issue of mine,
856000	860000	so let's maybe change the subject or I should stop drinking
860000	862000	because I'm going to overload a little bit.
862000	864000	Rob, will you pass over for the Play-Doh movie?
864000	867000	I don't want to talk about any of this anymore.
867000	868000	Not yet. We'll wait.
868000	870000	It's going to get me into trouble.
870000	872000	I'm starting to put my life back.
872000	875000	Keep drinking. We'll bring it back up at 9.30.
875000	878000	Thank you.
878000	880000	Yeah, so Green Arrow...
880000	881000	One fan.
881000	883000	Just use your exploding arrows.
883000	886000	You know, Green Arrow, I know if you were here,
886000	887000	he would say,
887000	889000	well, just use exploding arrows.
889000	891000	Why don't I just buy a gun?
891000	893000	Like a cop?
893000	895000	Like a police officer?
895000	896000	Yeah.
896000	897000	Like a hired...
897000	898000	Green gun.
898000	899000	Yeah.
899000	900000	Yeah, just keep shooting.
900000	901000	No one asked you.
901000	902000	Use only bullet arrows.
902000	909000	How about have the bow and arrow and have a gun?
909000	911000	Just as a standby.
911000	913000	Or a taser.
913000	917000	Or study philosophy and just, you know...
917000	918000	Get out of the hero game.
918000	919000	Yeah, get out of it.
919000	920000	Just an ugly game.
920000	921000	Just be your best you.
921000	923000	And why are you wearing a fucking mask, man?
923000	927000	You're walking around like Robin Hood with the beard.
927000	928000	I mean, who does...
928000	929000	Yeah, no one cares who you are.
929000	930000	I mean, wearing a mask, they're like,
930000	932000	oh my gosh, who's this, Carl?
932000	934000	Why does Aquaman have a beard?
934000	935000	I keep going to hotels.
935000	936000	I'm on the road a lot.
936000	938000	And there's always an Aquaman in my bedroom.
938000	940000	Why is this happening to me?
940000	944000	Rob, you're not wrong there because you turn the TV on
944000	945000	and what do you get?
945000	948000	The first thing you fucking get, you turn your TV on.
948000	949000	Sexy men.
949000	950000	No, you get Mario Lopez.
950000	952000	You get a Mario Lopez on there.
952000	953000	Hey, everybody, I'm Mario Lopez.
953000	956000	I'm here to talk to you about movies in your hotel room.
956000	957000	Like Aquaman.
957000	959000	And they talk about Aquaman for 30 minutes.
959000	963000	And a beard under water doesn't seem functional.
963000	965000	Well, work for Poseidon.
965000	966000	Yeah.
966000	969000	Oh, now you're going to go, well.
969000	973000	I'm just saying, name a fast-moving aquatic animal
973000	974000	that has air.
974000	975000	A seal.
975000	976000	An elephant seal.
976000	978000	Yeah, but very little.
978000	979000	They don't have a giant...
979000	981000	They have a huge mustache like a walrus.
981000	982000	Yeah.
982000	986000	Whales have teeth that are very much like a hairbrush.
986000	987000	Yeah, but they're inside their mouth.
987000	989000	You asked us to name an animal.
989000	990000	All right.
990000	992000	I know that there are mammals that have hair under water.
992000	994000	He's not a fish man, is he?
994000	995000	I don't know.
995000	996000	He's a fish man.
996000	997000	He's the king of Atlantis.
997000	999000	He's the king of Atlantis.
999000	1000000	Give him a break.
1000000	1001000	He didn't want to shave.
1001000	1003000	They don't have razors down there.
1003000	1005000	But he does shave because he shaves the part of his hair
1005000	1008000	around the Van Dyke goatee kind of thing.
1008000	1012000	He clearly is beardscaping around it.
1012000	1015000	So he cares about appearances.
1015000	1016000	Okay.
1016000	1017000	You want to know?
1017000	1018000	Do you want to know why?
1018000	1019000	Terrible acne scars.
1019000	1020000	Oh.
1020000	1021000	Awful.
1021000	1022000	There was a word.
1022000	1023000	Terrible acne scars.
1023000	1025000	I take it back, Mario Lopez.
1025000	1027000	Oh, you mean Aquaman.
1027000	1028000	Yes.
1028000	1029000	Okay.
1029000	1033000	It would be cool if he was just naked.
1033000	1034000	Right.
1034000	1035000	If his gimmick...
1035000	1036000	I think that would be the way to...
1036000	1039000	After all these attempts to like, we got to find the angle
1039000	1043000	on Aquaman because obviously in the 70s it became this joke.
1043000	1044000	You know, that was our...
1044000	1047000	We fell in love with this idea that there was a super friend
1047000	1052000	that given his roster of powers, like obviously the other heroes
1052000	1055000	would probably make fun of him and that kind of like stuck.
1055000	1059000	And then they tried to like beef up Aquaman in the comic books
1059000	1063000	to work against that or to make him like dark and depressed
1063000	1064000	and alienated.
1064000	1065000	To cut off his arm.
1065000	1067000	But I do think the...
1067000	1071000	Now that I think of it, the way to do it would be to make him
1071000	1073000	like naked.
1073000	1075000	That he would be like, let him be Jason Momoa,
1075000	1077000	but then just have the running thing be like,
1077000	1079000	he doesn't know what clothes are.
1079000	1080000	He lives...
1080000	1081000	He knows what they are.
1081000	1083000	He's not stupid, but he's like, I'm not wearing clothes.
1083000	1085000	You know who could help him out with that?
1085000	1086000	Dr. Strange.
1086000	1087000	Yeah.
1087000	1089000	That sounds like a strange thing to do.
1089000	1091000	Do you think...
1091000	1092000	Hey.
1092000	1094000	Do you think that we're stuck with these dudes?
1094000	1095000	Hey, Aquaman.
1095000	1096000	Hey, Aquaman.
1096000	1097000	You know what would be strange?
1097000	1099000	And this is what I do.
1099000	1100000	I do.
1100000	1101000	I do this.
1101000	1103000	You know what would be strange, Aquaman?
1103000	1104000	I'm crossing.
1104000	1105000	I can't do that, right?
1105000	1106000	Yeah.
1106000	1107000	Go ahead.
1107000	1108000	Go ahead.
1108000	1109000	All right.
1109000	1110000	Okay.
1110000	1111000	I won't do it.
1111000	1112000	Both companies will be owned by...
1112000	1113000	What?
1113000	1114000	You better finish this.
1114000	1115000	DC and Marvel.
1115000	1116000	Okay.
1116000	1117000	Dr. Strange goes, hey, take off your clothes.
1117000	1118000	That's strange.
1118000	1121000	Now put him over here by mine.
1121000	1124000	Okay.
1124000	1125000	I'm sorry.
1125000	1126000	I'm sorry.
1127000	1131000	Do you think that because of the time period that these characters were first created,
1131000	1133000	we're stuck in those archetypes?
1133000	1136000	Like, do you think that if this had been...
1136000	1137000	It's a crazy...
1137000	1138000	But 20...
1138000	1142000	Let's say we started doing DC and Marvel even 15 years later.
1142000	1145000	Would we have built these superheroes different?
1145000	1146000	No.
1146000	1147000	Just cosmetically.
1147000	1150000	I mean, to the extent that they have any kind of shelf life, one would hope that that was
1150000	1153000	because of an organic kind of thing that made us...
1153000	1160000	You know, we like certain characters because of archetypal behaviors, relationships with
1160000	1163000	their gadgets, not the actual design of the gadgets.
1163000	1170000	Like, if Tony Stark is sort of kind of in Batman, I think they're both kind of parallel
1170000	1172000	in that both of them people...
1172000	1179000	If they like them, what they like is the idea that you're not exceptional, you're not gifted
1179000	1184500	in any way, except maybe your intelligence or whatever, but you're not supernaturally
1184500	1192520	gifted and then you use your means and your will and your grit to take a place among the
1192520	1197520	gods and you're even bossing them around and stuff like you're Captain Kirk or something.
1197520	1201000	So the genre sort of pays attention to the time that it's in.
1201000	1207160	Yeah, I mean, that stuff's easy to change along the way unless people are like, Peter
1207160	1209720	Parker's white.
1209720	1215320	But we're living in that time right now where we're like, Captain Marvel might have been
1215320	1218360	a woman if...
1218360	1224280	That's among the many, what I would call cosmetic things that should be now...
1224280	1228440	If things like that aren't going to be up for debate, then retire the whole library
1228440	1232560	of all these characters because they were all white, they were all men.
1232560	1238200	And yeah, every once in a while, we would go like, Harlem man is here, and it's good
1238200	1247360	for us, I guess, in 1971, but just acting like because Harlem man exists that Peter
1247360	1257080	Parker can't become biracial in a reboot is kind of dumb, because that's a disservice
1257080	1262960	to the entire Marvel library, the DC library to go, because it's just a fact, it's just
1262960	1271160	a cultural fact that everybody in a comic book looked a certain way back then, which
1271160	1274880	is now not a definition of something that's like real life.
1274880	1277480	Because it seems like...
1277480	1278480	Say what?
1278480	1279480	Sorry?
1279480	1280480	They're not all men as well.
1280480	1281480	Oh, yeah.
1281480	1282480	I didn't mean to imply.
1282480	1283480	Yeah, I mean...
1283480	1285480	Oh, you're just going to shit on Cat 1?
1286480	1289880	My mama, my mama, Catwoman.
1289880	1290880	I mean, I...
1290880	1291880	Yeah, but...
1291880	1292880	Since Lukey.
1292880	1293880	Since Lukey.
1293880	1294880	What's happening?
1294880	1295880	Oh, it's actually really sad watching it.
1295880	1296880	Hey, do you remember me?
1296880	1297880	I'm Louise from Brisbane.
1297880	1298880	Oh, Louise from Brisbane.
1298880	1303880	Tiffany's the ghost who issued me an opera house.
1303880	1306880	Well, there were a lot of people there, it's a whole opera house.
1306880	1307880	I hate it.
1307880	1312680	I'm old time man, do you remember?
1312880	1315880	Is the mic picking this up at all, or...?
1315880	1316880	Okay.
1316880	1317880	Jeff.
1317880	1318880	Yes?
1318880	1323880	In Australia, at the Sydney Opera House, you were giving shit to all Australians, you were
1323880	1327880	saying, oh, people from Ipswich like this, people from Brisbane like this, I think you're
1327880	1328880	all crazy.
1328880	1331880	And I said, hey, you elected Trump.
1331880	1332880	Right.
1332880	1337880	And it brought the whole house down and you did like a 180 and you walked back and you
1337880	1338880	came back and then...
1338880	1339880	Is this fucking true, Jeff?
1339880	1340880	You do?
1341080	1344080	Did you vote for Trump?
1344080	1345080	You voted for Trump?
1345080	1346080	I am.
1346080	1348080	Did you vote for Trump?
1348080	1349080	I can't believe this.
1349080	1351080	I cannot believe this, Jeff.
1351080	1358080	Are you telling me you interrupted a show and started like talking to people on stage?
1358080	1359080	No, no, no, no.
1359080	1360080	I don't believe you.
1360080	1366480	I remember you now because last time you were sitting audience right, stage left and you
1366480	1368480	came down and bummed everybody out from that side.
1368480	1370480	Now you're doing it from that side.
1370480	1374280	So sit your ass down because you were dragged the other time too.
1374280	1375280	I do remember you now.
1375280	1376280	Are you sure she's the same one?
1376280	1378280	Yes, a fucking yes, exactly.
1378280	1379280	The same one?
1379280	1383280	Because that was my thought too, was like, oh my God, I'm having a fucking flashback too.
1383280	1386280	You don't get to just charge the stage because you want to.
1386280	1390880	You did it last time from over here at the Sydney Opera House and you came down and you
1390880	1392880	were shouted down by the crowd.
1392880	1393880	There's one charge.
1393880	1394880	How do we charge?
1394880	1395880	Oh, no.
1395880	1396880	There's two.
1396880	1397880	Okay.
1397880	1398880	You guys got to sit down.
1399280	1400280	For real.
1400280	1402280	I don't think that's the same person.
1402280	1404280	No, it's exactly her.
1404280	1406280	I remember it vividly now.
1406280	1407280	Thank you.
1407280	1410280	You were just a voice in the darkness, but now I've seen you visibly.
1410280	1415080	I mean, I appreciate your thoughts and it's okay to pipe in, but you don't get to just
1415080	1418080	like storm the Bastille like that.
1418080	1426680	Well, I don't appreciate your thoughts because obviously if I say, if I'm in the middle of
1426680	1432480	addressing the issue of whether or not it's okay for Peter Parker to be biracial and the
1432480	1438880	way I express the backdrop of my point is to say that everybody in comic books was a
1438880	1441240	white man in 1930.
1441240	1446880	It's not helpful or accurate to bother to go, what about Wonder Woman?
1446880	1448400	No, that's not the point.
1448400	1452760	Of course I don't mean all everything, all the time, absolute everything.
1452760	1458360	I'm like painting with these strokes to make a point about the movement of these things,
1458360	1467360	like the idea that I forgot Wonder Woman while trying to move toward wokeness is infuriating.
1467360	1470360	I'm glad you're infuriating.
1470360	1472360	No, no, no, no, no, no.
1472360	1475360	God, I fucking remember this so much.
1475360	1480160	She was standing, because it was a very raked theater, so it was very steep seating, and
1480160	1483760	she came down over here, and she did the exact same thing, but right there in my left eye,
1483760	1485760	and now it's on my right eye, and I say.
1485760	1494360	My memory of it was that it was very punctuated in Australia because they were much more like,
1494360	1498560	you know, they're probably like, they were just very quick to be like.
1498560	1500560	I was on stage.
1500560	1503560	You don't have a microphone.
1503560	1505560	You don't have a microphone.
1505560	1509560	For real, just like have security take that off.
1509960	1516960	That's the cool thing, because it seems like these comic books and these universes are like music in that
1516960	1520960	you're allowed to reinterpret them if you do a good job, right?
1520960	1526960	So if you do a remix of a very classic song, it seems like people are psyched about that.
1526960	1528960	Is that the same with superhero movies?
1528960	1530960	We can make Superman have a different trait now.
1530960	1532960	Yeah, I don't know.
1533360	1542360	It's like, okay, so people have a shit hemorrhage if you fuck with Superman's canonical list of abilities, right?
1542360	1551360	So if you make him not bulletproof just because that'll be more fun, I think that's fucked up, if that's what you're saying.
1551360	1553360	I just don't.
1553360	1558360	He always had heat vision, and he's always had the ability to blow cold.
1558360	1562360	But in the very beginning, I don't think he can actually just fly.
1562760	1568760	It's sort of like how Homer Simpson starts to look more like the Homer Simpson we know from the Tracy Ullman show.
1568760	1575760	Characters that can fly often start as characters that can leap tall buildings,
1575760	1579760	and then the leaping just kind of turns into flying over time.
1579760	1587760	But I think that for my money, the way to modernize Superman is to start from the...
1587760	1592760	Is not to worry about whether or not he can do this or can do that.
1592760	1598760	Start from the point of assumption that he can do everything, and then ask yourself in a modern context, what does that mean to us?
1598760	1607760	How would we react to that person, and how would he react to being perceived that way, and what would his goals be?
1608760	1616760	My thing with Superman is who cares about Kryptonite when in fact he has this much more crippling weakness,
1616760	1618760	which is that he doesn't want to be a bad person.
1618760	1620760	That's way more fucked up than Kryptonite.
1620760	1627760	If the police tell him to get down on his knees and put his hands behind his head, he technically has to.
1627760	1630760	I mean, unless he wants to be a criminal that day.
1630760	1635760	He's privileged in the sense that the cops probably won't say it because they don't want to die.
1635760	1637760	But he probably won't kill him.
1637760	1645760	So those are fun stories where it's like, oh, Superman, he's a criminal because he's questioning this congressman or whatever.
1645760	1647760	It seems to me that's the way to go.
1647760	1650760	Did you ever read J.J. Abrams' Superman script?
1650760	1652760	Flyby? Do you ever read it?
1652760	1656760	They didn't have... He didn't use Kryptonite either.
1656760	1666760	What he did was he said Superman didn't need Kryptonite because he was raised by humans,
1666760	1672760	and his adopted mother and father were saying, don't run as fast as you can.
1672760	1676760	Don't show people how strong you really are.
1676760	1682760	Always do less than what... Don't reach your potential because if you ever do, they'll take you away from us,
1682760	1685760	or they'll dissect you, or you'll be a monster.
1686760	1688760	Which is growing up in the Midwest.
1688760	1691760	Yeah, exactly. But that was very interesting because...
1691760	1693760	Sublimate your powers.
1693760	1698760	It was about a Superman who was like, I don't know how fast I really can go.
1698760	1703760	I might be able to go as fast... As faster than anything ever.
1703760	1704760	A speeding bullet.
1704760	1708760	I might be able to lift anything. He has no idea.
1708760	1711760	So that I thought was very interesting.
1712760	1717760	Let's say you had an inborn sense of morality, although it's a dangerous concept.
1717760	1720760	The idea of... Let's say you came from a different species,
1720760	1724760	and let's say somehow that species through either genetic or memetic evolution
1724760	1728760	had kind of like a benchmark morality to them,
1728760	1734760	where you start from a baseline of like, yeah, don't be a piece of shit.
1734760	1738760	And then you're transplanted to a savage planet,
1738760	1741760	where you're then raised by parents who are telling you,
1741760	1744760	yeah, you're special, but be careful.
1744760	1747760	Don't flash those powers because they'll take you away.
1747760	1750760	So you're motivated by not being taken away.
1750760	1753760	And then on top of that, you're also being reinforced the whole time
1753760	1756760	with this... You'll feel...
1756760	1760760	You'll never be tempted unlike a sort of wish fulfillment thing
1760760	1763760	where you're like, well, wait a minute.
1763760	1767760	If I did use these powers and stopped giving a shit
1767760	1772760	what everyone else thinks, I could be rich or I could be successful,
1772760	1775760	but then there's a loop there possibly with Superman
1775760	1781760	where he doesn't want to be rich or a rock star or successful.
1781760	1784760	He only wants the one thing which is actually quite difficult
1784760	1787760	for him to achieve, which is a sense of belonging.
1787760	1790760	Because he knows he's essentially deformed.
1790760	1795760	If he's not careful, he could karate chop your head off
1795760	1798760	while he's passing the salt.
1798760	1802760	And so he's embarrassed about that even though we would go,
1802760	1804760	well, there's nothing to be embarrassed about
1804760	1806760	because you should just use that to either rob banks
1806760	1808760	or stop people from robbing banks.
1808760	1810760	I would love to see that as him in high school.
1810760	1813760	He says, are you going to eat those Doritos
1813760	1815760	and accidentally knock somebody's heads off?
1815760	1818760	And then he just moves away.
1819760	1822760	I guess I've got to go to a different high school again
1822760	1825760	because I can't explain what's going on.
1825760	1827760	I'm just like, hey, how are you doing?
1827760	1830760	Yes, I'm the new student, Smart Schment.
1830760	1832760	And I'm going to be...
1832760	1834760	Smart Schment.
1834760	1836760	Smart Schment.
1837760	1839760	Is this helping?
1839760	1843760	I like that his powers make him a loser, not super.
1843760	1845760	It's kind of an interesting take.
1845760	1847760	He's the opposite of kung fu.
1847760	1850760	He just kills people by accident
1850760	1852760	and has to leave town every episode.
1852760	1854760	Oh, God damn it.
1854760	1856760	It's always like there's always some kind of thing
1856760	1858760	that he takes care of, you know,
1858760	1860760	and then he's like, well, you know, it's great.
1860760	1863760	A handshake. Oh, Jesus. Oh, okay.
1863760	1866760	Got to move again. Got to go.
1866760	1869760	Did you get your results of that Briggs Meyer test?
1869760	1871760	Did you get your results?
1871760	1872760	He's a mediator.
1872760	1873760	You're a mediator.
1873760	1874760	Yeah, you were there when I did it.
1874760	1876760	Well, I forgot your results, okay.
1876760	1879760	I don't think that was a fair test.
1879760	1882760	I thought you answered the questions very accurately,
1882760	1887760	but I didn't think that the results kind of, like, encapsulated you.
1887760	1891760	I felt like I was affected by everybody at the table, you know?
1891760	1893760	I was sitting there very passively.
1893760	1894760	I know, I know, but I'm just my own.
1894760	1896760	You mean everybody else?
1896760	1898760	I meant everybody but you.
1898760	1900760	Yes, I figure.
1900760	1902760	Where were you guys when you conducted the test?
1902760	1904760	Bielman's bar.
1904760	1905760	Okay.
1905760	1910760	And Dan, you want to explain what we're talking about to everybody else in the room?
1910760	1912760	Is it Briggs Meyer or Myers-Briggs?
1912760	1913760	Myers-Briggs.
1913760	1914760	Myers-Briggs.
1914760	1915760	I think all the kids know about it now.
1915760	1923760	I think they kind of like, some people, they'll put their signifiers
1923760	1930760	on their dating profile, which I thought about that and I was like, yeah.
1931760	1935760	I went through a cycle, I was like, well, I would love to know yours
1935760	1941760	before a blind date with you because not to, like, stack the deck,
1941760	1947760	but to actually just be like, oh, you know, you could actually,
1947760	1953760	the equivalent of, like, a failed first date could be actually created
1953760	1957760	by reading for 20 minutes, like, kind of, oh, there's a different personality,
1957760	1959760	this person actually, blah, blah, blah.
1959760	1963760	And that maybe then, if you, but if you were, and if you were down with that,
1963760	1968760	then you could show up to the first date more prepared to have it not be a disaster
1968760	1971760	because you'd be like, well, I already know that this person,
1971760	1974760	that there's such a thing as a person in the world that, believe it or not,
1974760	1977760	isn't that interested in this or that or whatever.
1977760	1979760	But then I thought about it more and I was like, I don't know,
1979760	1983760	I don't think I want, I think there's too many dishonest people in the world,
1983760	1988760	so, like, who wants, like, I think what's most valuable
1988760	1990760	is maybe doing your own thing and knowing who you are,
1990760	1994760	but then putting it out on a satellite dish for other people.
1994760	2002760	It's like, it's just like, I think, also there's, like, crazy people
2002760	2006760	that would, like, they'd take the test and they'd go, I'm a thingamabob
2006760	2011760	and then they'd be so into it that they would, like, fuck those people.
2011760	2014760	Dan, did you, you took the test?
2014760	2015760	Yeah, yeah.
2015760	2017760	What did you, what was the result?
2017760	2020760	I am an IN, wait.
2020760	2024760	I thought we did yours and you're the butt master.
2024760	2025760	Oh, yeah, yeah.
2025760	2026760	I'm the butt master, yeah.
2026760	2027760	Yeah, yeah, that's it, that's it.
2027760	2028760	You're the butt master.
2028760	2030760	Well, I'm a magician.
2030760	2038760	I can't, I think it's like INTP, is that, yeah.
2038760	2039760	What is that?
2039760	2044760	Introvert, narcissist.
2044760	2045760	Poopy pants.
2045760	2046760	Toilet paper.
2046760	2047760	Toilet paper.
2047760	2048760	Toilet paper.
2048760	2049760	You're an introverted narcissistic toilet paper.
2049760	2050760	Right.
2050760	2051760	Yeah, yeah.
2051760	2052760	I will say, for my money.
2052760	2053760	That's the butt master.
2053760	2059760	Because I remember when I, I remember getting a link to take it years ago,
2059760	2063760	I remember taking it and I remember getting same thing, same result,
2063760	2066760	the logician, and I looked at it a little bit and I was busy at the time
2066760	2069760	and I was like, sounds like me, but whatever, sort of horoscopes by.
2069760	2074760	And then, like, and then Cody sent me a link a couple weeks ago
2074760	2075760	and I did it again.
2075760	2077760	And then I, and that's why I remember it.
2077760	2078760	Cause I was like, this sounds familiar.
2078760	2079760	I got the same thing.
2079760	2082760	And then on top of that, when she told me what hers was,
2082760	2084760	that's when I momentarily was like, Oh, wait a minute.
2084760	2085760	This is like horoscopes.
2085760	2088760	Cause I also remember the campaigner.
2088760	2090760	Why do I remember that so vividly?
2090760	2095760	But it turns out the reason I do is because she also took it years ago
2095760	2096760	and got that same result.
2096760	2100760	So both Cody and I have taken it twice several years apart
2100760	2103760	and gotten the same personality category.
2103760	2105760	What is yours mean?
2105760	2106760	What is it?
2106760	2107760	What?
2107760	2108760	What is it?
2108760	2109760	Logician.
2109760	2110760	Logician.
2110760	2111760	Logical.
2111760	2112760	Lazy magician.
2112760	2115760	Lazy magician.
2115760	2116760	Logical.
2116760	2122760	I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to leave a rabbit in my hat.
2122760	2125760	We might get her out of this water or we'll just come back
2125760	2126760	and see if she swims.
2126760	2130760	I'm going to saw a lady one third the way through.
2130760	2131760	Pick a card.
2131760	2132760	Tell me what card it is.
2132760	2140760	Oh, look, you're a magician.
2140760	2141760	It's very accurate.
2141760	2142760	I can't remember most of it.
2142760	2144760	I just remember going, wow, yeah, that's me.
2144760	2146760	I mean, you're logic.
2146760	2147760	You're logical.
2147760	2148760	That's it.
2148760	2150760	Well, you know, it's not that simple.
2150760	2156760	I mean, it's not, it's, it's more like, uh, like a value placed on the idea
2156760	2161760	of logic, which can make for a very emotional person, you know,
2161760	2165760	like I think logicians are actually given to tantrums a little bit more
2165760	2169760	because they don't know how to handle their actual feelings because they,
2169760	2175760	um, they, they actually do believe and practice, uh, the, the, the idea
2175760	2178760	that there is such a thing as truth and the truth is more important than,
2178760	2181760	um, than, uh, than, than everything else.
2181760	2186760	And then, but, but also like very, uh, I was, I was happy to see, I was like,
2186760	2189760	yeah, I've always felt that way about myself.
2189760	2194760	Um, you know, that, that like, in spite of this very like meritocracy kind
2194760	2198760	of mind, which you now we've come to associate with the sort of like kind
2198760	2202760	of creepy archetype online, like you just don't even want to hear that word
2202760	2209760	right now, but, um, but, but within that, uh, the idea of like being truly open
2209760	2213760	to, um, like you don't care about hierarchy.
2213760	2218760	You, you, you really would prefer things to be on a flat plane and, um,
2218760	2223760	um, uh, so that you could just be extraordinary at your own thing and
2223760	2224760	everybody else could too.
2224760	2229760	And kind of like that, the truth would out and everybody would improve
2229760	2230760	themselves and stuff.
2230760	2235760	And then along the way, some like very like tip of like, like things that,
2235760	2238760	the downsides that are typical are like, okay,
2238760	2241760	this is not a person that is like always thinking about your feelings when
2241760	2245760	they're talking because they're trying to get their thoughts straight.
2245760	2248760	They're very comfortable, comfortable going off half cocked.
2248760	2252760	Um, they'll figure, they'll figure it out as they're talking and like they,
2252760	2256760	they just, they, they, they love explaining and they want to create the
2256760	2258760	system, the system and stuff.
2258760	2261760	And they believe the universe is a system and there's something to figure out.
2261760	2267760	And, uh, but, and then creatively for that reason, like endless revisions and
2267760	2273760	never ending, like not, not finishing of projects and stuff, which was kind of a
2273760	2274760	bummer.
2274760	2279760	How do you feel when you just in general, when you, uh, the idea of like,
2279760	2281760	oh, there's 16 personalities, here's yours.
2281760	2286760	I think the effect on me was sort of like a simultaneous, uh,
2286760	2291760	kick in the nuts and lift lifting up.
2291760	2293760	So not contradictory, just kicked in the nuts so hard that you,
2293760	2298760	you're lifted up a teeter totter.
2298760	2303760	Uh, the, the, the, because it's like on one hand, you are what you are.
2303760	2308760	And it's kind of, because I think everybody wants to be special for the
2308760	2309760	purpose of contributing.
2309760	2312760	Everybody wants to be special so that they can fit in.
2312760	2313760	Isn't that crazy?
2313760	2315760	People, people really do want a job.
2315760	2318760	What about, what about, what about Wonder Woman?
2325760	2326760	I did forget her.
2326760	2331760	So spiteful that everybody laughed at him saying Wonder Woman so much more.
2334760	2335760	Then her back there.
2335760	2336760	They were just like Wonder Woman.
2340760	2341760	Let that be a lesson.
2341760	2343760	Pick your moment.
2343760	2345760	That's the funny way of doing it.
2345760	2346760	Right.
2346760	2347760	Right.
2347760	2349760	Don't stand up and walk to up to the stage.
2349760	2351760	But it is an interesting concept, right?
2351760	2355760	That like, like you get the Woody, Woody from Toy Story kind of thing of like,
2355760	2360760	you know, that idea of finding out that you're unremarkable in a certain sense,
2360760	2363760	that there are others of you, that you're a category.
2363760	2364760	Don't look at me, man.
2364760	2367760	It can be, it can be, I think what we're seeing, you know,
2367760	2370760	we're seeing that that's what the internet, the internet has given us is like
2370760	2373760	the idea of no matter how fringe you are, there's always going to be at least
2373760	2375760	500 other people out there somewhere.
2375760	2379760	And now you don't have to get in a plane to find them.
2379760	2381760	That's uplifting always.
2381760	2383760	Like, oh, who else here?
2383760	2385760	You know, I just watched the Flat Earth documentary.
2385760	2387760	Have you guys watched it?
2387760	2389760	I started watching it, but I didn't get it all the way through.
2389760	2392760	It's a little less heartbreaking and shitty than you might think it is.
2392760	2396760	Because I know, you know, that like basically probably all Flat Earthers.
2396760	2399760	I got, I remember on this podcast, I would always be like,
2399760	2401760	Flat Earthers are basically heroes, right?
2401760	2403760	Because how could you commit to that?
2403760	2406760	And then, and then like everything else, the election changed everything.
2406760	2411760	Because it was just sort of like, oh, this is just another expression of
2411760	2413760	anti-intellectual revolution.
2413760	2415760	And like, I don't, I'm not charmed by it anymore.
2415760	2417760	But it's worth watching.
2417760	2419760	It's a charming documentary.
2419760	2424760	They, and there's some uplifting parts to it, too,
2424760	2427760	that do feel like actually actionable items.
2427760	2433760	Especially for people who look, the scientific community,
2433760	2439760	kind of like the idea that maybe it's important to,
2439760	2444760	that it's not scientific to ridicule people.
2444760	2446760	It accomplishes nothing.
2446760	2449760	If your scientific goal is for people to value science
2449760	2452760	and you know that you live in a world where for whatever reason
2452760	2454760	there are people who are pushed so far away
2454760	2458760	that they're in a dark, dirty corner making up their own science,
2458760	2461760	that you got to know scientifically
2461760	2464760	that you're never going to bring them back by laughing at them.
2464760	2469760	Not that they're not funny, but if that's your goal,
2469760	2471760	if it's your goal to bring them back,
2471760	2476760	then you got to know as a scientist that the way to bring them back
2476760	2481760	is you're going to have to go way more than what's fair in their direction.
2481760	2484760	Like, they're not going to meet you halfway as one of them.
2484760	2489760	There's a guy that's interviewed in it who's Spiro something.
2489760	2491760	He's a physicist at Caltech that I actually was,
2491760	2493760	I recognized him because I was on a panel with him,
2493760	2496760	a Rick and Morty kind of science panel.
2496760	2498760	Science panel?
2498760	2500760	I know, yeah.
2500760	2504760	And he had such a cool, so many cool things to say.
2504760	2506760	A lot of the scientists in the documentary,
2506760	2510760	it's like, oh, there's this evolution that's being forced upon us
2510760	2517760	where it's like, hey, man, okay, so now we've got this other danger.
2517760	2520760	There's going to be people that are going to be so,
2520760	2522760	like, revenge of the nerds happened.
2522760	2524760	It's over.
2524760	2526760	The nerds are in control.
2526760	2532760	Now there's, like, people gathering in little clusters
2532760	2537760	who are suffering from confirmation bias
2537760	2542760	and whatever it's called, Kepler, Alan Parsons project disorder,
2542760	2543760	whatever that.
2543760	2544760	Dunning Krueger.
2544760	2546760	Dunning Krueger, in fact.
2546760	2548760	Bach would turn to overdrive.
2548760	2555760	And the documentary does a really good humanizing job
2555760	2557760	of illustrating that absolutely perfectly,
2557760	2561760	like showing their little meats and editing it in such ways
2561760	2566760	where everything kind of becomes really clear
2566760	2568760	and humanizes everybody.
2568760	2571760	And there's scientific communities
2571760	2575760	where it's like the woke version of being a scientist now
2575760	2580760	is talking to each other,
2580760	2583760	scientists that are qualified that know everything,
2583760	2585760	talking to each other and saying,
2585760	2587760	what are we going to do about these guys?
2587760	2588760	They're not going away.
2588760	2590760	They're not enchanted by us.
2590760	2597760	Waiting for everyone to get so into fucking logic
2597760	2600760	that they flock to us is not working.
2600760	2603760	I love, like, on Twitter, Professor Brian Cox,
2603760	2608760	he'll engage with some flat earthers once in a while,
2608760	2611760	and it's hilarious because he just shows them images
2611760	2614760	and shows them, like, it gives them a reason.
2614760	2619760	But they only see that reason and that logic as proof
2619760	2621760	that there's something to fight against.
2621760	2623760	There's a really great sequence in this documentary
2623760	2628760	where one of the more scientifically minded people
2628760	2631760	is explaining the difference between, you know,
2631760	2636760	this point A to point B scientific process
2636760	2640760	where as much as none of us want to be wrong,
2640760	2643760	if you're a true scientist, you're like, if I'm wrong,
2643760	2645760	I'm wrong, and kind of moving forward
2645760	2648760	to whatever conclusion is actually there.
2648760	2651760	And then him breaking down the very common reverse
2651760	2655760	of that process where you've decided what your conclusion is
2655760	2657760	and how you kind of weed things out
2657760	2661760	and backwards paint this arrow from B to A.
2661760	2664760	And while he's explaining that,
2664760	2667760	they're editing it with a conversation
2667760	2671760	with a wonderful, charming human guy
2671760	2674760	that I don't want to see suffer.
2674760	2678760	It was explaining that they're so into flat earth
2678760	2682760	that they bought a $20,000 gyroscope.
2682760	2685760	They raised the money because they knew that
2685760	2688760	if the earth really was round,
2688760	2691760	that you should be able to get a gyroscope
2691760	2695760	that would register a 15 degree per hour shift
2695760	2697760	in the tilt or whatever.
2697760	2699760	And those things are really expensive,
2699760	2702760	so they raise the money and they get this $20,000 gyroscope
2702760	2704760	in the mail and they open it up.
2704760	2706760	And as soon as they open it up, they turn it on
2706760	2709760	and it's registering a 15 degree an hour shift
2709760	2711760	and then they start putting it in different containers
2711760	2713760	made of different things to shield it
2713760	2716760	from the glass dome above us.
2716760	2719760	And so he's explaining that process,
2719760	2721760	which is an adventure to him,
2721760	2723760	an adventure that starts with like,
2723760	2725760	oh, what windmill is what?
2728760	2730760	But they're editing it back and forth.
2730760	2732760	There's someone explaining this is how this works.
2732760	2734760	You know that the earth is flat,
2734760	2737760	so now getting this gyroscope is just,
2737760	2739760	it's like the Joker escaping from Arkham.
2739760	2741760	It's like a job to do.
2741760	2744760	You've got to figure out how to defeat him.
2744760	2747760	And so they're trying to figure out.
2747760	2750760	And that reminds them of experimentation and science
2750760	2752760	because it looks the same thing,
2752760	2754760	but what you're doing is,
2754760	2759760	that guy is like, he's at these meetups
2759760	2763760	and he's having these private conversations
2763760	2765760	over in the corner of the bonfire party
2765760	2767760	and he's kind of explaining to somebody like,
2767760	2772760	yeah, I'm not going to bring up the gyroscope this year
2772760	2774760	at Flat Earth Con.
2774760	2775760	It's a big...
2775760	2777760	Kind of a bugbear.
2777760	2778760	Yeah.
2779760	2781760	You're going to do some more experiments.
2781760	2783760	I brought it up before, I won't repeat it,
2783760	2786760	but I had a Lyft driver and he was a Flat Earther
2786760	2788760	and I asked him 20 questions.
2788760	2792760	He gave me 20 answers that he had ready to go.
2792760	2794760	Well, we're all of them.
2795760	2797760	Number one, here's the number one.
2797760	2799760	The top five, Flat Earth.
2799760	2802760	Starting with number 20, going to number one.
2803760	2805760	Number 20 coming in.
2805760	2807760	We've done this before, but at the end...
2807760	2809760	Not all 20 of them, here we go.
2809760	2813760	20 questions and answers about Flat Earth.
2813760	2815760	He was an intelligent guy, but I was like...
2815760	2816760	Number 20.
2816760	2819760	You're using navigation right now on your phone
2819760	2823760	to get me from meltdown to the drawing line.
2823760	2824760	Flat Screen.
2827760	2828760	Flat Screen.
2828760	2829760	Flat Screen.
2829760	2830760	Number 19.
2830760	2832760	One of the more fascinating things is,
2832760	2834760	of course, as you might expect, the division.
2834760	2838760	Like, you have a solidarity, but then the divisions.
2838760	2842760	The infinite plane people from the pheasant under glass people.
2842760	2845760	I don't know how they differentiate, but like...
2849760	2851760	As soon as you become a prominent Flat Earther
2851760	2853760	and you have a podcast that people follow,
2853760	2855760	now you're a dispenser of information,
2855760	2858760	which by virtue of the same kind of oppositional defiant
2858760	2861760	engine that's powering the religion of the group.
2861760	2864760	And I would say, if you're a woman
2864760	2866760	and if you're reasonably attractive,
2866760	2868760	like this one woman is in this thing,
2868760	2872760	like she's easy on the eyes
2872760	2875760	and she has a Skype podcast with this other guy
2875760	2878760	who literally lives in his mom's basement,
2878760	2880760	but you don't really hate these people.
2880760	2883760	You're just sort of like, oh, you guys are cute.
2883760	2885760	Because they're good natured.
2885760	2887760	I mean, they just happen to think the earth is flat
2887760	2888760	and they're truly dedicated to it,
2888760	2892760	but the crazy thing is then the brief dip they take
2892760	2894760	into the dark forest of,
2894760	2896760	okay, here's what it's like to be a woman
2896760	2898760	and be a Flat Earther.
2898760	2902760	Because immediately, the last three letters
2902760	2904760	of her first name are CIA,
2904760	2906760	because she's Patricia, so I mean,
2906760	2909760	she's just asking for it.
2909760	2912760	Her last name is Steer, so she's clearly a honeypot
2912760	2914760	that's been sent to seduce Flat Earthers
2914760	2918760	and steer them the wrong way toward the NASA-governed thing.
2918760	2920760	Like, everybody's a robot and everybody's...
2920760	2926760	What's the first day of conspiracy factory office
2926760	2927760	or whatever?
2927760	2929760	Like, okay, all right, what's your name?
2929760	2931760	We've got to change that.
2931760	2932760	What are we going to do?
2932760	2934760	I'm thinking Steer, because you're going to be Steer.
2934760	2936760	Like, why would you do all of that?
2936760	2937760	That's always the...
2937760	2939760	That's such an important linchpin
2939760	2940760	to conspiracy theory universes
2940760	2943760	that the Illuminati love bragging,
2943760	2945760	because if they didn't love bragging,
2945760	2947760	so much of this shit wouldn't make sense
2947760	2948760	at the end of the day.
2948760	2951760	Why would they put the ghost in Tom Selleck's living room
2951760	2952760	in Three Men and a Baby?
2952760	2954760	Because they're trying to tell us.
2954760	2958760	They want us to know.
2958760	2961760	Why would they let this copy of Back to the Future get out
2961760	2963760	if it's crawling with 9-11 predictions?
2963760	2965760	This movie is crawling with 9-11.
2965760	2969760	Because the whole point is to do 9-11 right in front of you.
2969760	2973760	It makes the 9-11 so delicious that you knew about it.
2973760	2976760	It's like when you soak a tortilla chip in the salsa.
2976760	2978760	If I'm repeating a thing from a previous podcast,
2978760	2979760	then fuck it.
2979760	2982760	But Rob, I told the driver, I said,
2982760	2985760	but why do we see eclipses as a circle on the moon?
2985760	2989760	Because it's just flat disks that are casting shadows.
2989760	2993760	But every time, why is it a curve in this?
2993760	2994760	And he had an answer.
2994760	2997760	It's a bullshit answer, but he had an answer.
2997760	3001760	And I said, let's say you and I stood 100 miles apart
3001760	3005760	on the equator and walked due north.
3006760	3009760	I'm saying that at one point, you and I would meet each other
3009760	3011760	because we live on a sphere.
3011760	3013760	And he goes, no.
3013760	3014760	We would keep walking straight.
3014760	3016760	I go, and then what would happen at the end?
3016760	3018760	And he goes, I said, would we fall off?
3018760	3020760	And he goes, no, because there's a ridge at the end
3020760	3022760	and you can't fall off.
3022760	3023760	Yeah, it's ice.
3023760	3024760	It's a wall of ice around.
3024760	3026760	Yeah, that's dumb.
3026760	3029760	And I said, oh, you're a moron.
3029760	3030760	And I laugh.
3030760	3031760	He goes, no, I'm sorry.
3031760	3032760	You're not a moron.
3032760	3035760	I go, but seriously, what do you think would happen?
3035760	3037760	He goes, I said, I'm going to fly you and me.
3037760	3040760	We're going to be 100 miles apart on the equator
3040760	3041760	and walk north.
3041760	3043760	He goes, if you pay for it, I'll do it.
3043760	3044760	Ah.
3044760	3045760	That's how they get you.
3045760	3046760	That's how they get you.
3046760	3048760	And now he's in Barbados having a fucking time of his life.
3048760	3051760	What would it take for you to believe in the round earth?
3051760	3053760	I guess you're right.
3053760	3055760	I'm living in Margaritaville, man.
3055760	3057760	If you're like Pina Colada.
3057760	3058760	I guess you're right, man.
3058760	3061760	Let's do it again next summer.
3061760	3062760	Some of these guys.
3062760	3064760	Thanks for the hotel.
3064760	3065760	Some of them.
3065760	3066760	You bought me a hotel.
3066760	3067760	Like the gyroscope guy.
3067760	3069760	And then they have another experiment that they wanted
3069760	3071760	that they're doing in it throughout the movie
3071760	3073760	where they're like, look, we're so convinced.
3073760	3075760	And they come up with a scientific idea.
3075760	3079760	We're going to take three beams.
3079760	3080760	We're going to put them.
3080760	3085760	They found a place where, OK, we've got 3.8 miles of space
3085760	3086760	to play with here.
3086760	3089760	We're going to put three beams equidistant from each other
3089760	3091760	along this 3.8 mile stretch.
3091760	3099760	3.8 miles will equate to a certain amount of curvature
3099760	3100760	within that space.
3100760	3103760	A certain degree of curve.
3103760	3106760	But they're going to prove that that curvature doesn't exist
3106760	3112760	by taking a laser and shining it through three holes
3112760	3113760	on these things.
3113760	3117760	And if the middle one is going through,
3117760	3118760	the earth ain't flat.
3119760	3122760	And then they cut to a scientist hearing about that.
3122760	3123760	They just described the thing.
3123760	3125760	And he's like, OK, well, is it?
3125760	3127760	Well, OK.
3127760	3128760	All right.
3128760	3129760	Yeah, they're fucked.
3129760	3133760	He's kind of like, yeah, no, actually, it
3133760	3136760	sounds like they're in trouble.
3136760	3138760	That's a real experiment that you can do.
3138760	3141760	They're going to prove that the earth is round accidentally,
3141760	3143760	and they're going to be bummed out.
3143760	3145760	And yeah, and I won't spoil it.
3145760	3148760	But it is kind of interesting.
3148760	3151760	Spoilers, the earth is round.
3151760	3155760	It's kind of like not entirely.
3155760	3158760	There's so many different camps and even just sort of culturally.
3158760	3161760	And it's not as much as I thought it would be,
3161760	3165760	where it's just like, I'm going to sharpen my buoy knife
3165760	3167760	and blame the Jews for everything.
3167760	3172760	And it makes me feel empowered to do the scientific equivalent
3172760	3174760	of saying, I don't know.
3175760	3176760	I don't know that.
3176760	3178760	You know that.
3178760	3181760	There's a lot more joy.
3181760	3185760	And for some of the people who are like the engineers,
3185760	3188760	they're doing these Boy Scout experiments.
3188760	3191760	But the only thing about it is that they're not
3191760	3194760	going to take no for an answer.
3194760	3198760	And there's a very interesting analysis of that concept, too,
3198760	3200760	where it's like, what would you actually do?
3200760	3203760	Because these guys, they have awards shows.
3203760	3205760	They're experiencing joy.
3205760	3207760	They're experiencing the-
3207760	3210760	I wish a cult would take me.
3210760	3213760	That's the joy, is you see these groups together.
3213760	3216760	Not that Comic Con is similar, but it is similar
3216760	3218760	in that you will see people together
3218760	3220760	that you would never see together.
3220760	3222760	And it's a great thing.
3222760	3225760	So I hear you on like, you don't want to wake them up.
3225760	3226760	Yeah.
3226760	3229760	And then the documentary does take responsibility
3229760	3231760	with some minor piano chords at a certain point
3231760	3234760	when it touches on like, these people have children.
3234760	3235760	You know?
3235760	3236760	And that's not funny.
3236760	3238760	It's not fun.
3238760	3239760	It's cute.
3239760	3241760	You get caught up in like, this is cute, this is cute,
3241760	3242760	this is cute.
3242760	3244760	And then it's like, the children.
3244760	3248760	It's like an American movie with, what's his name?
3248760	3249760	Borcher?
3249760	3250760	Yeah.
3250760	3252760	Yeah, I did think of that in my head.
3252760	3253760	I was thinking about that.
3253760	3254760	Oh, this is awesome.
3254760	3255760	This guy just wants to make movies.
3255760	3259760	Then second act or third act, oh, he has three children.
3260760	3261760	He has like nine.
3261760	3263760	I was like, yeah.
3263760	3264760	All right.
3264760	3265760	Moving on.
3265760	3267760	Boy, we got so much to cover.
3267760	3268760	All right.
3268760	3269760	Let's start.
3269760	3270760	Okay.
3270760	3271760	Okay.
3271760	3272760	Part two of Harman Town.
3272760	3273760	I've already talked about this.
3273760	3274760	Here we go.
3274760	3276760	Part two of Harman Town.
3276760	3277760	I've already talked about it.
3277760	3285760	After a commercial break, we're going to go back.
3285760	3288760	Dan's going to blow your mind with the second half.
3288760	3289760	I've already talked about this.
3289760	3291760	Last week, I talked about wrong place, wrong time.
3291760	3299760	This is another true crime, linguistic thing I would like to alter.
3299760	3300760	That irritates you.
3300760	3301760	You don't like it.
3301760	3302760	I...
3302760	3303760	You don't like it.
3303760	3307760	Welcome to the part of the podcast we call Get Off My Law Words.
3307760	3314760	Come on, words.
3314760	3315760	Get off my...
3315760	3316760	That's your new mug, Rob.
3316760	3317760	Get off my lawn, words.
3317760	3319760	Get off my lawn, words.
3319760	3321760	Get off my lawn, words.
3321760	3324760	Get off my lawn, words.
3324760	3327760	Get off my lawn, words.
3327760	3329760	Everybody get off my lawn.
3329760	3331760	All your words.
3331760	3332760	All your words.
3332760	3335760	Get off my lawn.
3335760	3343760	Get off my lawn, words.
3343760	3344760	Dan...
3344760	3345760	Wait, wait, wait.
3345760	3346760	Dan doesn't like something.
3346760	3351760	Everybody, listen up.
3351760	3354760	I didn't deserve that at all.
3354760	3355760	No, no, no.
3355760	3356760	Go ahead.
3356760	3365760	I was backing a truck of chicken out of a restaurant and stopped for a marathon of bicyclists,
3365760	3368760	and the last one kicked my truck.
3368760	3373760	I fucking waited, and I got chicken to move.
3373760	3377760	You guys are just dicking around trying to act Italian.
3377760	3378760	Yeah.
3378760	3381760	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
3381760	3384760	That is the shittiest British accent.
3384760	3385760	I'm sorry.
3385760	3387760	That he thinks it's Italian.
3387760	3388760	Sorry, Dan.
3388760	3391760	Dan, I'm sorry I've made fun of you.
3391760	3398760	Get off my lawn, words.
3398760	3405760	Get off my lawn.
3405760	3413760	I'm going to do this for at least 30 more times, by the way.
3413760	3416760	All right, Dan, what's on your mind?
3416760	3417760	Look, I just...
3417760	3418760	I've said it before.
3418760	3427760	I'll say it again.
3427760	3434760	I think that when we're dealing with children's undergarments in true crime shows,
3434760	3436760	they can all be underwear.
3436760	3442760	I don't understand why a three-year-old missing girl, if you find her underwear,
3442760	3445760	why do we have to call them panties?
3445760	3446760	I don't...
3446760	3449760	I understand...
3449760	3454760	I'm not saying if you're a parent and you call your toddler's underwear,
3454760	3457760	if there's a girl, if you feminize the underwear, it's fine.
3457760	3462760	The forensic thing where it's like, and then we took the panties and we looked for semen,
3462760	3464760	I'm like, why do they have to...
3464760	3466760	They can just be underwear.
3466760	3469760	That's not going to be an inaccurate way to describe them.
3469760	3471760	No one's going to go like, what?
3471760	3474760	Did she have a dick?
3474760	3475760	They're still underwear.
3475760	3480760	Panties is just a kind of substrate of underwear that we use when we want to
3480760	3482760	feminize undergarments.
3482760	3487760	I hope at this point we cut to me and Spencer doing me and his head.
3487760	3490760	But it's just like, remember the John Bonet special?
3490760	3494760	God love him, Henry Lee, like the rock star.
3494760	3495760	The special?
3495760	3497760	But he was just like...
3497760	3500760	There was a John Bonet special?
3500760	3504760	And he's just like, oh, it took Penti and all the Penti and the semen stain.
3504760	3506760	Oh, there's so much semen on the Penti.
3506760	3507760	And I was just like...
3507760	3509760	The special?
3509760	3510760	It was a special?
3510760	3515760	Like they did the rainbow special and then like...
3515760	3517760	Yeah, the solid gold dancers came out.
3517760	3520760	It wasn't a series and it wasn't a movie.
3520760	3521760	What do you fucking want from me?
3521760	3525760	It was not special.
3525760	3527760	What is it if it's not a series or a movie?
3540760	3541760	Oi.
3545760	3548760	I don't want to hear the word Panties anymore.
3548760	3552760	Unless you're over a certain age.
3552760	3554760	I don't want to...
3554760	3555760	We found your Panties.
3555760	3556760	I don't like it.
3556760	3559760	Panties is a weird word just to begin with.
3559760	3560760	Panties.
3560760	3561760	They can retire that shit.
3561760	3562760	Yeah.
3562760	3563760	You know what?
3563760	3564760	Cookies.
3564760	3565760	Moist.
3565760	3566760	Everything's cooked.
3566760	3569760	Only one thing is a cookie.
3569760	3572760	It should be called bakies.
3575760	3577760	If I make an omelette, that's a cookie too.
3577760	3578760	Yeah.
3578760	3579760	I cooked my omelette.
3579760	3580760	Yeah.
3580760	3581760	All right.
3581760	3582760	Yeah.
3582760	3583760	Yeah.
3583760	3584760	You like that?
3584760	3585760	I'm on board.
3585760	3586760	Rob, what do you think about that?
3587760	3588760	Get off!
3588760	3591760	Get off my lawn!
3591760	3594760	Wait!
3594760	3598760	Get off my lawn!
3598760	3600760	Wait!
3600760	3602760	It doesn't say where did cookie come from.
3602760	3603760	That had to be just like...
3603760	3604760	It's so stupid.
3604760	3605760	Yeah.
3605760	3606760	The UK, they call them biscuits.
3606760	3607760	We call them cookies.
3607760	3610760	That seems fucking way too sweeping for me.
3610760	3611760	Yeah.
3611760	3612760	You never cook a cookie.
3612760	3613760	You bake a cookie?
3613760	3614760	You bake a cookie.
3614760	3615760	You bake a cookie.
3615760	3616760	You bake a cookie.
3616760	3617760	You bake a cookie.
3617760	3618760	You bake a cookie.
3618760	3622760	And there's no way that the cookie technology is so old that...
3622760	3624760	It's like we fucked up.
3624760	3626760	Do you pop a sickle?
3626760	3627760	No.
3631760	3633760	What's up, Seinfeld?
3634760	3636760	What's wrong with people?
3636760	3638760	Who has ever popped a sickle?
3638760	3639760	No, I've never popped a sickle.
3639760	3641760	Why do they call them sweaters?
3641760	3643760	There's no ice in ice cream.
3644760	3654760	There's a little bit of ice.
3654760	3657760	Yeah, because panty is like...
3657760	3660760	You said there's no ice.
3660760	3664760	You said there's absolutely no ice.
3664760	3666760	It's not true.
3666760	3668760	Remember me?
3668760	3670760	Sit down.
3670760	3672760	Sit down.
3673760	3675760	By Jove, I think she's got it.
3675760	3676760	I think she's got it.
3676760	3679760	I'm dedicated to accuracy.
3679760	3681760	I'm a good girl, I am.
3681760	3684760	I won't tolerate Michigan.
3685760	3689760	Anybody know how this Captain Marvel movie did this weekend?
3689760	3690760	Anybody here?
3690760	3695760	On its way to make one billion dollars the consistent thing right now in March,
3695760	3698760	which supports your women's month.
3698760	3701760	It's good, because they just released this thing that said,
3701760	3705760	now, statistically, women's movies make more than men's movies,
3705760	3709760	so let's make more women's movies and get that sweet, sweet paper.
3710760	3711760	All right.
3712760	3713760	I agree.
3713760	3715760	Because then we can make more dead movies.
3715760	3717760	It does seem like an end run, because the tradition,
3717760	3720760	the old 80s tradition is like, oh, the ladies' movie,
3720760	3723760	Flowers of Forgotten Love.
3723760	3724760	And then you're like...
3724760	3725760	That's a good one.
3725760	3728760	The chauvinist male is like, oh, God, a chick flick or whatever.
3728760	3729760	But it's like...
3729760	3734760	There's so much steam behind the idea that if Captain Marvel's a woman
3734760	3737760	and we're making progress, it's like the guys could just...
3737760	3740760	If they could just calm the fuck down and sit back,
3740760	3742760	what they're getting on a silver platter is like...
3742760	3748760	They're doubling their control over their hegemony,
3748760	3751760	because now their girlfriend's going to be like,
3751760	3752760	I want to go see Wonder Woman.
3752760	3754760	And it's like, well, thank God there's fucking lasers in it.
3754760	3755760	Right.
3755760	3756760	Like, don't...
3756760	3757760	It's a win-win.
3757760	3761760	Like, take your fucking blessings, whatever the expression is.
3761760	3764760	Take your gift horse's teeth and put him in a cup
3765760	3767760	and get the hell out of that tooth bank.
3769760	3770760	Tooth bank.
3770760	3772760	Sorry, what were you saying, Brandon?
3772760	3773760	That was it.
3773760	3774760	That was saying tooth bank.
3774760	3776760	And when's the Harlem Man movie coming out?
3776760	3777760	Harlem Man.
3777760	3778760	Harlem Man movie.
3778760	3781760	What is Harlem Man's origin story, Dev?
3781760	3787760	He was in a tenement building and his mama sent him down
3787760	3789760	to the furnace room, the boiler room,
3789760	3791760	but there were drug dealers down there
3791760	3795760	that were using the boiler to hide contraband,
3795760	3797760	but what they didn't know is that the contraband
3797760	3799760	was actually like a new...
3799760	3801760	It was like a new designer drug that was using
3801760	3804760	LexCorp-funded microwave radiation,
3804760	3806760	and it made the boiler blow up,
3806760	3812760	giving him the power to speak the truth.
3813760	3815760	So you're just going to rip off the Jackson Five?
3820760	3821760	Same premise.
3821760	3822760	Same premise.
3822760	3823760	Exact same premise.
3823760	3824760	All five of them?
3824760	3825760	All five of them.
3825760	3826760	All five of them.
3826760	3827760	All five just went down to the boiler room?
3827760	3828760	No.
3828760	3830760	When they went down, there was only one of them.
3831760	3832760	Oh, that's their power.
3832760	3833760	Yeah.
3833760	3834760	To speak the truth.
3835760	3839760	It's like they blossom down into an array of Jacksons.
3839760	3840760	They're like Voltron.
3840760	3843760	Jermaine's like the arm and fucking...
3843760	3845760	Tito's the leg.
3845760	3847760	Tito is the leftovers.
3853760	3855760	What happened to Rockwell?
3855760	3856760	Man.
3856760	3858760	I feel like there's these times in life
3858760	3860760	where you make just enough money and you're like,
3860760	3861760	all right.
3861760	3863760	I feel like that dude who's Barry Gordy's kid...
3863760	3864760	I feel like...
3864760	3865760	He's already kind of rich.
3865760	3866760	Oh, really?
3866760	3867760	Made that song.
3867760	3868760	I feel like he made it $3,000.
3868760	3869760	What was Rockwell's big hit?
3869760	3870760	Rockwell.
3870760	3871760	I always feel like somebody's watching me.
3871760	3872760	I always feel like...
3872760	3874760	But the lyrics are like, it's Rockwell who's...
3874760	3877760	Michael Jackson's cousin is just going like,
3877760	3879760	Hey, it's me, Rockwell.
3879760	3881760	And I took a shower.
3881760	3884760	And I got kind of scared that someone was going to stab me.
3884760	3887760	And then it's like Michael Jackson comes in for that.
3887760	3889760	I always feel like...
3889760	3890760	Oh, that's Michael Jackson.
3890760	3891760	It's like...
3891760	3892760	That's cheating.
3892760	3893760	It's cheating.
3893760	3894760	Cheating.
3894760	3895760	It's absolutely cheating.
3895760	3896760	It's cheating.
3896760	3897760	It's cheating.
3897760	3900760	It's like the way Phil Collins will use Sting sometimes.
3900760	3901760	But you know what?
3901760	3903760	I just watched Purple Rain again and...
3903760	3905760	What's his name?
3905760	3906760	Morris Day.
3906760	3908760	That's his movie.
3908760	3910760	He steals that fucking movie from me.
3910760	3911760	Prince is not a great actor.
3911760	3913760	He's a great performer, but he's a shit actor.
3913760	3915760	And the same way that David Bowie is not a great actor.
3915760	3916760	He's a great performer.
3916760	3917760	Yes.
3917760	3919760	But fucking Morris Day, he's good in that movie.
3919760	3921760	I mean, I'm team Prince in that movie.
3921760	3922760	And it does...
3922760	3923760	It polarizes you.
3923760	3925760	You do have to pick a side.
3925760	3926760	I'm just saying...
3926760	3927760	You have to pick a side.
3927760	3929760	The movie that demands you pick a side.
3929760	3930760	It does.
3930760	3931760	It fucking absolutely does.
3931760	3936760	Didn't Morris Day and the Times break up just before that movie came out?
3936760	3937760	No.
3937760	3939760	I felt like they were together for a little while because the Ice Cream album.
3939760	3940760	Ice Cream.
3940760	3942760	Ice Cream Castles is right after that show.
3942760	3944760	You are young.
3944760	3946760	Nicely done.
3946760	3948760	You are free.
3948760	3952760	Let's be together.
3952760	3954760	Inter-racially.
3954760	3956760	Yeah.
3956760	3958760	You are white.
3958760	3961760	Vanilla and chocolate.
3961760	3962760	I like that movie of that movie.
3962760	3964760	I just came up with this.
3968760	3969760	The fucking bird.
3969760	3970760	The bird fucking rocked.
3970760	3972760	And then he did the oak tree.
3972760	3973760	And then the oak tree was that movie.
3973760	3975760	Because he was like, give that bird a place to land.
3975760	3977760	Then he did the...
3977760	3979760	But he was all about the cashmere.
3979760	3982760	Then he did the end table.
3982760	3983760	Or camel hair?
3983760	3984760	What was that?
3984760	3985760	It was like...
3985760	3986760	He was like...
3986760	3987760	He had the white fucking coat on.
3987760	3988760	But he was the...
3988760	3991760	It's crazy because it's two hair bands, basically.
3991760	3993760	Going at each other in Minnesota.
3993760	3994760	And there's a rivalry.
3994760	3995760	And he's a bad guy.
3995760	3996760	I like that they all go to each other.
3996760	3997760	Which is crazy.
3997760	3999760	They go to each other's shows and they all stand in the back like,
3999760	4000760	oh, the fucker.
4000760	4004760	It's like, look at this motherfucker's eye makeup.
4004760	4005760	But then the prince...
4005760	4006760	But prince...
4006760	4007760	Yeah.
4007760	4008760	Yeah.
4008760	4009760	Yeah.
4009760	4011760	I love that he licks his hand first.
4011760	4014760	Like, oh, I've got to clean myself.
4014760	4015760	Yeah.
4015760	4016760	He's like a little...
4016760	4017760	Did they bring a mirror out?
4017760	4018760	That shit's awesome.
4018760	4022760	Greatest job in all of music is to hold a mirror for Morris Day.
4022760	4024760	You know the best part of that...
4024760	4029760	Is that Purple Rain?
4029760	4032760	What album is Take Me With You on?
4032760	4033760	It's Purple Rain.
4033760	4035760	So, best part of that song.
4035760	4037760	To be around you.
4037760	4040760	Oh, so that your sheer perfection.
4040760	4041760	And then, thank you.
4041760	4042760	Thank you.
4044760	4045760	Such a great...
4045760	4046760	Yeah.
4046760	4047760	Yeah.
4047760	4048760	It's just no...
4048760	4049760	You don't get that kind of reciprocity.
4049760	4050760	Like, it's just healthy.
4050760	4051760	It's self-care.
4051760	4057760	It's like the therapist was wandering through the studio that day and was like,
4057760	4058760	keep that in.
4058760	4059760	She's like...
4059760	4062760	They're like, oh, we were going to cut it.
4062760	4064760	She's not supposed to say thank you.
4064760	4065760	She just...
4065760	4066760	Yeah, you know why she said it.
4066760	4067760	She felt complimented.
4067760	4068760	Keep it in.
4068760	4070760	The same therapist told James Brown,
4070760	4072760	it's okay to want to kiss yourself.
4074760	4075760	Jump back first.
4075760	4076760	Don't hurt yourself.
4076760	4077760	Jump back.
4077760	4079760	Kiss yourself.
4079760	4080760	Okay.
4080760	4082760	Well, I don't know why I keep looking at my notes.
4082760	4085760	I got panties and Briggs-Meijer test.
4085760	4086760	I didn't even write down panties.
4086760	4088760	I knew I was going to remember that.
4090760	4091760	It's a weird word.
4091760	4092760	I just hear it all the time.
4092760	4093760	Yeah, it's not good.
4093760	4094760	Panties.
4094760	4095760	Is it?
4095760	4097760	I found a new true kind podcast, but I'm like...
4097760	4098760	Lobster.
4101760	4103760	That's a strange one.
4104760	4105760	Continue.
4105760	4110760	Get off my lobster.
4116760	4118760	What's your beef with lobster, Rob?
4118760	4120760	Well, it's two words.
4121760	4124760	It's together, and it doesn't describe what it is.
4124760	4126760	It's just two syllables together.
4126760	4127760	It's not two words.
4127760	4128760	Lob and stir.
4128760	4130760	Stir is not a word.
4130760	4132760	It kind of is a foreboding thing,
4132760	4134760	but they're going to be lobbed into water
4134760	4136760	and then stirred into their doom.
4136760	4137760	Okay, then it works.
4137760	4139760	It could be a mnemonic device.
4139760	4140760	Then I love it.
4140760	4141760	Yeah.
4141760	4142760	How do you feel about hamster?
4142760	4143760	I love that, too.
4143760	4145760	You like hamster?
4145760	4146760	Sure.
4146760	4148760	Hey, what the fuck is a gerbil?
4148760	4149760	Huh?
4150760	4151760	Is there a wild gerbil?
4151760	4153760	Did gerbils exist in the wild?
4153760	4158760	He was Hitler's propaganda minister, I think.
4159760	4162760	Are there gerbils and hamsters in the wild, or are they just like...
4162760	4163760	Ghost of gerbils.
4163760	4164760	What about guinea pigs?
4164760	4165760	Huh?
4165760	4166760	They're not pigs.
4166760	4168760	Are they from Guinea?
4173760	4176760	The greatest part is that he is staring at you
4176760	4178760	and you refuse to look.
4179760	4183760	That 90% is the greatest fucking thing.
4189760	4191760	That's what black kids...
4193760	4194760	Oh, no.
4194760	4195760	Oh, no.
4196760	4198760	Exterminate.
4198760	4200760	Exterminate.
4206760	4207760	Get back.
4207760	4208760	You get back.
4208760	4210760	Weaponize his desk.
4214760	4217760	Gerbils are really mean hamsters that don't do tricks,
4217760	4220760	whereas a hamster can like fill its side pouches with food.
4220760	4222760	A gerbil is like a domesticated rat.
4222760	4223760	Wow.
4224760	4227760	My mom was a daycare center teacher and...
4227760	4228760	For gerbils?
4228760	4229760	Yeah, for gerbils.
4230760	4232760	Fucking so much money, you know what I mean?
4232760	4233760	Oh, man.
4233760	4235760	So much fucking money, man.
4235760	4237760	So much fucking money, gerbil money.
4237760	4239760	Making that gerbil money.
4239760	4240760	Making that gerbil money.
4240760	4241760	So we would get...
4241760	4244760	Wasn't that the love interest in issue three of Harlem Man?
4244760	4247760	Was the daycare center teacher, the underpaid...
4247760	4250760	I told you, you can't come here until the students are gone.
4251760	4254760	I just wanted to warn you that Lex Luthor's up to no good again.
4255760	4258760	I wish he was doing something like helping these kids.
4258760	4261760	Girl, I have so much on my mind, I can't help nobody right now.
4261760	4264760	Girl, that's your job, to take care of the children
4264760	4266760	while I fly into the sky.
4266760	4268760	We need you more than ever right now.
4268760	4269760	You stupid.
4274760	4275760	I will never eat your pussy.
4276760	4277760	Whatever.
4279760	4282760	Listen, you're gonna need to double date with me and Vanita this weekend.
4282760	4283760	Fine.
4283760	4285760	You promised. Aquaman gonna be there.
4285760	4286760	And he wants to...
4286760	4289760	You gotta make us look good, because he says he's better than you.
4290760	4291760	Oh, because he can swim.
4295760	4297760	I am not getting my hair wet.
4297760	4299760	Hey, hey, sorry, sorry, sorry.
4299760	4300760	This is great, but...
4303760	4304760	Okay.
4304760	4306760	I thought about bringing up this before, and I said,
4306760	4308760	I don't want to interrupt, but now I do.
4308760	4309760	So...
4310760	4311760	Okay, so...
4312760	4315760	What you were referring to, like, Aquaman was like a punchline.
4316760	4319760	Oh, hey, why don't you go talk to some fish, Aquaman?
4319760	4320760	We're gonna all go take a...
4320760	4324760	Why didn't Aquaman, like, go to Batman and go,
4324760	4325760	what can you do?
4325760	4326760	Can you breathe underwater?
4326760	4327760	Can you talk to fish?
4327760	4329760	No, you've got a car.
4329760	4331760	Go fuck yourself.
4332760	4334760	You can't breathe underwater.
4334760	4335760	Let's hold our breath underwater.
4335760	4336760	I can do it forever.
4336760	4337760	How about you?
4337760	4338760	You can?
4338760	4340760	Oh, you bought your way into...
4340760	4342760	Fuck this shit!
4342760	4343760	Fuck this!
4343760	4345760	But wouldn't Batman be like, what do we ate?
4345760	4346760	Hold your breath underwater.
4346760	4348760	You guys are making fun of me and talking to fish!
4348760	4350760	My parents are dead!
4351760	4354760	Hey, if I was your parent, I'd kill myself.
4354760	4355760	Wow!
4356760	4357760	Fucking Aquaman.
4357760	4358760	Whoa.

4359760	4360760	Whoa, bro.
4360760	4361760	No, I'm sick of this.
4361760	4362760	Whoa.
4362760	4363760	I'm fucking sick of this.
4363760	4366760	Yes, I can talk to fish, and none of you motherfuckers can.
4366760	4368760	And they all hate you.
4368760	4369760	I'm Mario Lopez.
4369760	4370760	You got to turn into channel 38.
4370760	4372760	You can see Aquaman.
4372760	4373760	It goes in a really weird direction.
4373760	4375760	Starts off with a lot of weird shit.
4375760	4376760	I'm gonna grow a beard.
4376760	4377760	I don't give a shit.
4377760	4378760	I don't give a shit.
4379760	4382760	It'll get in my eyes, but I'll look good when I come out of the water.
4385760	4386760	Talk to a fish?
4386760	4387760	Yeah, I mean...
4387760	4388760	What are you gonna...
4388760	4389760	What are you gonna...
4389760	4390760	Talk into a fish?
4390760	4391760	Let me tell you...
4391760	4392760	What's a...
4392760	4393760	Maybe you should listen.
4393760	4394760	Yeah, I mean...
4394760	4395760	They have a lot...
4395760	4396760	Let me tell you what a fish is.
4396760	4398760	A fish is the SUV of worms.
4401760	4403760	Fucking shops fired.
4403760	4404760	It's true.
4404760	4405760	Look at live fish.
4405760	4407760	Evolutionarily, you've taken no risks.
4407760	4410760	You've just added fucking gas tanks and like...
4410760	4412760	Like, you want to be able to see over smaller cars.
4412760	4413760	Big deal.
4413760	4416760	I mean, I would like to talk to like a...
4416760	4417760	Like a...
4417760	4418760	Like a seahorse.
4418760	4421760	Just to say like, what's up with that?
4421760	4422760	Yeah.
4422760	4426760	Like evolutionarily, like how does that fucking score you points?
4426760	4428760	You saw a question mark and said, I'll have one of those.
4428760	4429760	Yeah.
4430760	4436760	This is the Def Jam comic who's into fucking marine biology.
4436760	4437760	What is it?
4437760	4439760	What's up with this seahorse?
4439760	4443760	How you gonna call yourself the daddy and you shit not all them babies?
4447760	4450760	I don't know how to have no damn 30 babies, man.
4450760	4451760	What?
4451760	4452760	I'm trying to get drunk.
4452760	4453760	What?
4453760	4454760	What?
4455760	4460760	Jellyfish I get because they're just a bunch of snot that lives forever.
4460760	4462760	I'll sign up for that job.
4462760	4465760	Like you can't fuck up a jellyfish unless it runs into a boat.
4465760	4466760	Like they live forever.
4466760	4467760	Yep.
4467760	4468760	They're immortal.
4468760	4469760	Yeah.
4469760	4470760	Are they?
4470760	4471760	They're really...
4471760	4472760	Why isn't there a jellyfish man?
4472760	4473760	You should get on that.
4473760	4474760	You're doing all this superhero stuff.
4474760	4475760	I'm not doing anything.
4475760	4476760	You're doing it.
4476760	4479760	You're doing it.
4479760	4481760	Put jellyfish man in there.
4481760	4482760	Story bully.
4482760	4483760	Yeah.
4483760	4485760	But you don't call it man of war.
4485760	4487760	You call it woman of war because it's...
4487760	4490760	What about Wonder Woman?
4490760	4491760	Thank you.
4491760	4493760	It was stupid.
4493760	4497760	Somebody in the crowd went, stupid.
4497760	4498760	And I'm on your side, sir.
4498760	4500760	I believe that you were absolutely pregnant.
4500760	4502760	Did someone call woman of war?
4502760	4505760	But she's not Portuguese.
4505760	4507760	Isn't Portuguese man of war?
4507760	4508760	Yeah.
4508760	4509760	Yeah.
4509760	4510760	Keep going.
4510760	4511760	There's like a whole whitewash scandal.
4511760	4513760	They're like, why didn't they cast a Portuguese person?
4513760	4514760	Yeah.
4514760	4515760	We had to make it a woman.
4515760	4517760	Why is woman of war from Basque Country?
4517760	4518760	It's so close to Lisbon.
4518760	4519760	You could have done a fucking...
4519760	4522760	Too light-skinned to play a Portuguese man of war.
4522760	4526760	They're saying that Will Smith is too light-skinned to play...
4526760	4527760	He is.
4527760	4528760	Oh, go on.
4528760	4529760	I didn't know there was more.
4529760	4530760	I didn't know there was more.
4530760	4532760	I'm just going to let that shit sit right there.
4532760	4535760	Next on Harmony Town.
4535760	4537760	Why are you too light-skinned to what?
4537760	4540760	He's too light-skinned to play Serena Williams' dad
4540760	4542760	after just having played a blue genie.
4542760	4544760	I don't know what the fuck.
4544760	4549760	You cannot make people happy.
4549760	4551760	We have talked about the whole like, what was it?
4551760	4556760	Shazam, Alibaba, Sinbad thing, Millennials,
4556760	4559760	where they think that they're living in a parallel universe
4559760	4562760	because they think they remember a movie.
4562760	4568760	But it seems clear to Gen Xers that what's going on is that they're just racist.
4568760	4573760	That they conflated different thoughts and constructs and things
4573760	4576760	where they're like, there's a guy named Sinbad and then there's like this thing.
4576760	4577760	Yeah, anyways.
4577760	4579760	All right.
4579760	4584760	And then Berenstein Bears things, anti-Semites.
4584760	4586760	Also not real bears.
4586760	4589760	No.
4589760	4592760	The Berenstein Bears is crawling with 9-11s.
4592760	4593760	Did we ever...
4593760	4597760	Did anybody ever...
4597760	4599760	Did anybody ever...
4599760	4603760	You know, did we ever activate anybody to look into that Hajpok,
4603760	4606760	Lickwell, like Baron Trump traveling through China?
4606760	4607760	Baron Trump thing?
4607760	4608760	I don't know.
4608760	4609760	I didn't...
4609760	4610760	I haven't...
4610760	4611760	Nobody cared.
4611760	4612760	What happened?
4612760	4613760	Oh, sorry.
4613760	4616760	How do I catch you up?
4616760	4618760	Rob found a thing.
4618760	4620760	It was like a YouTube video by a guy...
4620760	4621760	You're welcome.
4621760	4625760	...who found a book published in the 1800s...
4625760	4626760	Oh, yeah.
4626760	4630760	...about a kid named Baron Trump who travels through time and becomes the last president
4630760	4631760	or whatever.
4631760	4633760	I'm getting some details wrong.
4633760	4634760	But just a lot of...
4634760	4639760	I'm sure somebody on Reddit said that we were wrong.
4639760	4640760	Was that...
4640760	4643760	Is that an actual thing or is it somebody fudging that?
4643760	4644760	I don't know.
4644760	4654760	There's a book called 1900 or The Last President that is about a little boy who is called Baron
4654760	4662760	Trump, whose mentor is named The Don, and he lives on Fifth Avenue in New York where
4662760	4663760	Trump Tower is.
4663760	4665760	This is legit or this is something...
4665760	4666760	Apparently, yeah.
4666760	4667760	I mean, like, I've been...
4667760	4669760	We don't really know.
4669760	4670760	How do you know?
4670760	4671760	We'd have to read the book.
4671760	4676760	This is what the video is saying is the...
4676760	4677760	So weird.
4677760	4683760	Get off my lawn book.
4683760	4688760	I think we were hoping that in a world where if I clear my throat wrong, there's 10 paragraphs
4688760	4694760	written about it that we could maybe use that energy in our favor and have people go out
4694760	4696760	and research this thing.
4696760	4699760	Are they really commenting on you that way?
4699760	4700760	I don't know.
4700760	4701760	Are they really?
4701760	4707760	I actually did go through the Reddit because, again, I was looking for my real audio porn
4707760	4713760	and I was glad I stumbled through there because it wasn't, like, lethal.
4713760	4716760	Like, it was an uplifting feeling.
4716760	4718760	You probably shouldn't live your life.
4718760	4723760	You probably shouldn't have shit you refuse to do and places you refuse to go.
4723760	4725760	That's probably no matter what.
4725760	4731760	As much as that feels like self-care at certain points and maybe temporarily, that's a good
4731760	4734760	measure, like, withdraw from something, build a wall.
4734760	4737760	But not the best word.
4737760	4743760	Oh, the word wall.
4743760	4750760	You probably don't want that there forever because it's like having a cast on your leg.
4750760	4751760	So what did you discover?
4751760	4752760	I don't know.
4752760	4753760	I just looked through and I was like, well, this isn't that bad.
4753760	4755760	What's the worst someone's going to say?
4755760	4757760	Oh, he's a despicable asshole.
4757760	4760760	Like, prove it.
4760760	4762760	So are you.
4763760	4764760	Right.
4764760	4768760	Also, it's better to read it from a distance.
4768760	4769760	A distance.
4769760	4770760	Yeah.
4770760	4771760	More importantly, a bunch of nice stuff.
4771760	4772760	I just like a bunch of nice stuff.
4772760	4776760	Like, clearly, just a bunch of people who are very, like, they're like, you know, somebody,
4776760	4781760	like, there was a thread where somebody was like, I hate this Reddit behavior.
4781760	4784760	Like, I should just call it online behavior.
4784760	4789760	Someone's like, can someone satisfy a question for me?
4789760	4791760	And he's just like, this isn't going to be a real question.
4791760	4794760	I'm like, oh, what is it you find entertaining about this podcast?
4794760	4797760	Because I just, doesn't it just seem like he's just a terrible person.
4797760	4798760	I just don't understand.
4798760	4799760	I really, I genuinely love.
4799760	4805760	I'm not doing anything that would make me accountable to an opinion and stating it in
4805760	4806760	an unhealthy way.
4806760	4807760	I'm genuinely just seeking information.
4807760	4811760	Like, please, please tell me, tell me how to enjoy Harmontown.
4811760	4818760	And what was nice was just like, just like a gentle cascade, like, like of, of a bunch
4818760	4820760	of people going, sounds like it's not for you.
4820760	4824760	And it was like, like, oh, that's got to be the result of a cultivation of something,
4824760	4829760	even if it's just wearing people down, just erosion of the human psyche.
4829760	4831760	But like, like, just, it was just softness.
4831760	4835760	It was just like a million people going like, yeah, I don't, I mean, yeah, don't,
4835760	4838760	why would you, why would you get on the internet, listen to something and then
4838760	4840760	don't, don't, sounds like you hate it.
4840760	4841760	Get out of here.
4841760	4844760	Not, not get out of here, like, but just people.
4844760	4847760	And then, and then laced within there, people going like, yeah, what are you going
4847760	4848760	to do?
4848760	4852760	A guy, guy talks for two hours a week for fucking 80 years.
4852760	4857760	Like, oh boy, what a, what a, what a terrible time that one time was.
4857760	4858760	Who cares?
4858760	4859760	Like they're there.
4859760	4864760	The Facebook group actually mobilizes, raises funds, does things, reaches out to
4864760	4865760	each other.
4865760	4867760	They like treat each other like family.
4867760	4868760	There's less like shit talking.
4868760	4871760	It's actually super interesting to see.
4871760	4873760	Which, which medium?
4873760	4875760	Facebook.
4875760	4877760	This guy loves Facebook.
4877760	4878760	I do love a little Facebook.
4878760	4883760	He should call you, he should call you Brandon Face Johnson original book.
4883760	4886760	You gotta have a hidden, can you hide the Facebook part of there?
4886760	4887760	Drunk.
4887760	4889760	And your name doesn't lend itself to wordplay at all.
4889760	4892760	Two weeks ago you said, I'm bad at names.
4892760	4896760	But it is cool to see like that versus the Reddit because they're, they're the
4896760	4902760	same, it's the same fan base, but they're two totally different kids.
4902760	4906760	Like those cats are like on Facebook, they're like, we're raising money for
4906760	4908760	and someone so feels down.
4908760	4912760	So let's, let's lend a little love versus some of the criticism that we receive
4912760	4913760	on Reddit.
4913760	4916760	I had an epiphany cause I'm listening to this new podcast, like Cody and I
4916760	4918760	call him Asperger detective.
4918760	4923760	The title of the show is called like cold case.
4923760	4925760	It's the most innocuous title.
4925760	4927760	It's like cold case murder files or something.
4927760	4929760	It's like the most generic thing.
4929760	4933760	And it's just this guy, his name is Kyle something.
4933760	4937760	And he's like, Hey everybody, it's me, Kyle something.
4937760	4941760	And I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you about the John Benet Ramsey
4941760	4942760	case.
4942760	4946760	And this is a very curious case because a lot of people have a lot of opinions
4946760	4947760	about it.
4947760	4951760	But what they don't understand is that it's all about evolution, swarming and
4951760	4952760	the redirection of light.
4952760	4961760	And, um, and he's so, so spectra me that it all goes continually almost to the
4961760	4969760	point of sexy and, uh, before plummeting into, um, it's, it's, he's a
4969760	4972760	personality and we're addicted to him and we like him.
4972760	4977760	And we, we, but, but like, I had kind of an epiphany while Cody was reading his
4977760	4981760	iTunes reviews because I was like, people are going to be mean to this guy
4981760	4985760	because he sounds like he's sucking on a Jolly Rancher all the time.
4985760	4987760	Like the, the microphone is like real close to his mouth.
4987760	4990760	And so there's just sort of like this.
4990760	4995760	Like, like it's, it, it, it, it, and I, and I,
4995760	4996760	Asperger detective.
4996760	4998760	Take the Jolly Rancher out.
4998760	5001760	And people were like hitting his, like just everything about his inflection
5001760	5005760	because for, for, for a while he has this pattern where every sentence has to end
5005760	5006760	like this.
5006760	5009760	And it has all of these, he's explaining everything and I'm explaining
5009760	5010760	everything.
5010760	5012760	And, and so everyone's like, what are you, a valley girl?
5012760	5015760	Why does the sentence have to go like, people are really, and I was like, I was
5015760	5020760	listening to these things and I was cringing on his behalf, but, and then
5020760	5026760	atoning with that, that cosmic force, because I was like, boy, I sure hope
5026760	5034760	that this doesn't affect him.
5034760	5038760	And I think that these, because what good would that do?
5038760	5039760	Yeah.
5039760	5043760	I mean, outside of like, if he was like, oh, I should take the Jolly Rancher
5043760	5044760	out.
5044760	5045760	And I think you can hear him.
5045760	5048760	Like, I think you can hear him start to like, try to force himself to like, I
5048760	5052760	think he is like we were Cody and I were analyzing and going, I think he is
5052760	5056760	seeing some of this stuff and it is maybe hurting him or not.
5056760	5058760	But in any case, he's like adjusting.
5058760	5064760	And but, but the most important thing, like, like, like, oh God, what, like,
5064760	5065760	like, I don't know.
5065760	5069760	It's just like fresh eyes on this concept of like people have like talking
5069760	5071760	about him because he's a product.
5071760	5073760	He's put himself out there.
5073760	5075760	He has 13 listeners.
5075760	5085760	He has 13 Patreons, Patreons, and so he's like, he's like, you know, he's
5085760	5091760	not, he's not worth taking down, but people are drifting through and they're
5091760	5093760	like, they got a lot to say.
5093760	5097760	Some people have a lot to say about how deep and thoughtful he is.
5097760	5106760	Some people really go for the jugular about his very on the cuff flaws and
5106760	5112760	it was just sort of an educational process for me to go, oh, well, okay, I
5112760	5113760	hear all that.
5113760	5114760	I can laugh at all that.
5114760	5118760	I can, I can observe the same things they're observing, but God, what a
5118760	5123760	tragedy it would be if he let any of this like fuck up his day.
5123760	5124760	I don't know.
5124760	5126760	I guess I don't think I'm, I don't think I'm able to articulate my point.
5126760	5130760	It's just sort of like, like, like then putting myself back in the
5130760	5132760	position where it's like, Oh, wait a minute.
5132760	5136760	You're a fucking dude, like putting this thing out.
5136760	5137760	It's a product.
5137760	5140760	Like, like, like, it's like, you're a build a bear.
5140760	5141760	You're a, you're a character.
5141760	5142760	You're a thing.
5142760	5146760	Like people want to be able to talk about you and they don't want, none of
5146760	5151760	them would want you to ever be like, Oh, well, that's going to make me change
5151760	5154760	everything about my life or I'm going to, I'm going to kill myself now, or I'm
5155760	5159760	going to stop doing this or start doing that because they would be like, whoa,
5159760	5160760	whoa, whoa.
5160760	5162760	What part of me listening didn't you understand?
5162760	5166760	I'm just like the internet is where you can just type about this stuff.
5166760	5169760	I'm just a couple of ear holes, like sucking your shit in.
5169760	5170760	And I got nothing to say.
5170760	5171760	So I may as well say about this.
5171760	5175760	Like, I didn't want you to fucking have an opinion about the human species
5175760	5180760	because, uh, because of this stuff, but I can't figure out, you know, at
5180760	5181760	what point you're supposed to.
5181760	5183760	It's a weird motivation.
5183760	5184760	I just don't know.
5184760	5187760	Like, cause I was like, I don't think anybody wants you in the sub Reddit
5187760	5188760	really.
5188760	5193760	Like, because as much as they'd be excited that you were there in the long
5193760	5198760	term, they'd be like, what am I supposed to like police myself and talking
5198760	5199760	about?
5199760	5200760	Oh, I hate it.
5200760	5203760	When, when he talks about this or when he does that a little bit, maybe they
5203760	5208760	should, but, but, uh, a little bit, because, um, we really are doing the
5208760	5210760	best that we can.
5210760	5214760	And we make a, we make and we make a product.
5214760	5218760	Sometimes we dip in there to see, uh, how the product's getting received.
5218760	5220760	Cause we want to make sure that you like the shit.
5220760	5223760	But if people wanted to have to worry about that, they'd go to their own
5223760	5224760	Thanksgiving dinners.
5224760	5229760	Like, like, Oh, uncle Bob heard you talking about the Packers and now he's
5229760	5230760	throwing a shit fit in the kitchen.
5230760	5232760	And it's like, that's the thing that people are getting away from when they
5232760	5234760	consume other people.
5234760	5237760	Strangers, they just go, Oh, I, and they, and they actually, if anything,
5237760	5241760	they like to like, they, I think they, you know, you pour more into it in
5241760	5245760	terms of like love and hate and like judgment and opinions and stuff.
5245760	5249760	It's like actually a reflection of how far, how hard you're trying to get away
5249760	5252760	from the mess that is your own life.
5252760	5257760	And you're just like, Oh, I hate Becky on the, uh, the home shopping channel
5257760	5259760	when she honks that horn.
5259760	5262760	Like you're just, you're engaging in consumption.
5262760	5266760	If you keep it at that level, when you start to make it personal though, it's,
5266760	5269760	um, certainly something that, uh, you need to question your motivation.
5269760	5273760	Cause like when I open up my mouth to speak and trying to make people laugh or,
5273760	5276760	or, or do something decent versus like somebody who thinks that they're
5276760	5279760	crafting some incredible shit talk.
5279760	5282760	That's a whole different beast at which point you're sort of calling yourself
5282760	5283760	out.
5283760	5286760	So there's a, there's a point that you made that I agree with, which is like
5286760	5290760	you're, you're trying to run away from your own shitty life by talking shit.
5290760	5293760	And I definitely think people should be allowed to talk shit, but when it gets
5293760	5299760	personal, you got to ask yourself, am I, do I, am I negating that this person
5299760	5305760	has experiences that they've been through that my comments might actually trigger?
5305760	5310760	Like I don't want to shit on, I'm not necessarily David Hasselhoff fan, but
5310760	5313760	I'm not going to be like David Hasselhoff's album.
5313760	5317760	I'm not going to make an account and a fake name just so I can get on a Yahoo
5317760	5321760	chat board and go, David, David Hasselhoff sucks.
5321760	5323760	And here's the 15 reasons why.
5323760	5327760	Like at that point, David Hasselhoff maybe needs to call you up and say, you
5327760	5331760	outside cause I'm outside at that point.
5331760	5334760	Cause there, there is this part where I'm like, if you're so creative with your
5334760	5337760	words, why the fuck would you choose to put me down?
5337760	5341760	I travel a lot and I go on Yelp all the time just to find a place to eat, like
5341760	5345760	find some vegetarian food or find the bar or find like a place like that.
5345760	5348760	Scott, this or that whatever I'm craving Italian food or whatever.
5348760	5353760	And I go on Yelp places that I know that I like.
5353760	5357760	Like, you know, like I've always, I always go to this place in Seattle and I always
5357760	5362760	go to that, that these two places in Portland and awesomely they have bad
5362760	5366760	reviews because like that means the assholes ain't going there.
5366760	5370760	Like you read the bad reviews and it was some douchebag that had a bad date and
5370760	5372760	like, like he won't be there.
5372760	5376760	But like, I know that I can have fun in that place because like, I don't want to
5376760	5381760	see like 7,000 five star reviews on a place because that means everybody's
5381760	5382760	there.
5382760	5387760	Like, like, so like sometimes the, the negativity helps you like, yeah, filter
5387760	5390760	out the, the, the, the Tritus.
5390760	5391760	Yeah.
5391760	5396760	I do think anonymity is like key to our species problem as we join, as we move
5396760	5399760	from did real to digital.
5399760	5404760	Like that is just absolutely the key is this concept of anonymity because we're,
5404760	5409760	we are, I, I have had my career affected by anonymous people.
5409760	5413760	That is something that we were supposed to reserve for black and white
5413760	5417760	photographs in certain sections of history books that because that is a brick through
5417760	5424760	a window, you know, like the reason why Facebook kind of heralded the mass
5424760	5429760	migration of our parents to the internet was because what they perceived there
5429760	5433760	was something different from my space, which was, oh, so I know who I am and I
5433760	5435760	know who my uncle is.
5435760	5440760	And if I'm playing Farmville, I can, there, there is there, there, this idea that
5440760	5445760	we could actually just move what we're accustomed to over onto a digital
5445760	5446760	platform.
5446760	5450760	And then it's like, it's as if we're in the, right now we're in the worst of both
5450760	5455760	worlds because we're, we're just in this process of spending all of our time
5455760	5464760	online, but we were online is currently a place that it, the ratio of anonymity
5464760	5471760	to importance is really something that unlike any culture we've ever experienced.
5471760	5475760	I just think of like carnival when we were in Venice and we were learning about
5475760	5479760	the history of this concept of carnival, where it was like, oh, they did this one
5479760	5481760	thing and they thought it was a, like a one time thing.
5481760	5485760	And then like the, the nobles were like, we should do this for a month.
5485760	5487760	Oh, like wear masks and rape people.
5487760	5488760	Yeah.
5488760	5492760	Like, like, like, and, and like all of this culture like started to like overtake
5492760	5495760	the city where it was like, everyone was like, yeah, this is great.
5495760	5497760	We should just all do this all the time.
5497760	5499760	I'm a bird.
5499760	5500760	I'm not John.
5500760	5501760	I'm a bird.
5501760	5503760	And like, I do what birds do.
5503760	5507760	And it was like, it was just sort of like, I remember learning about it and being
5507760	5508760	like, this sounds fair.
5508760	5513760	This is what I've, what we're experiencing right now, where it's like, there's a
5513760	5519760	anonymity in, in some, some respects, like it's, it can be like a super powerful,
5519760	5520760	liberating thing.
5520760	5527760	But it overall, the idea that I think it brings out really, really terrible things.
5527760	5534760	Like the only thing keeping you a good monkey is the fear of all the monkeys
5534760	5535760	beating you up.
5535760	5539760	They, they, they, they did experiments with bots where they tried to create
5539760	5544760	politeness bots where that would detect inflammatory language on Twitter, come
5544760	5551760	into a conversation and say, hey, this is, this is much easier to program a bot
5551760	5555760	this way than it is to like a bot that is also easy, which is just like detects
5555760	5560760	Trump's name and there's comes in and goes like nothing burger, the AIDS.
5560760	5565760	Um, but, uh, but they, they made, they tried using bots that would like detect
5565760	5572760	like spikes of like energy, inflammatory conversations and come in and just be
5572760	5578760	that person in a, in a conflict that says to an aggressor, Hey, this other
5578760	5581760	person's a person, even though ironically, the bot is not a person.
5581760	5585760	Um, maybe you should think of them as a person, that kind of stuff, just kind of,
5585760	5589760	kind of like a lifeguard or something like that, or maybe like one of those like
5589760	5592760	speed trap mannequins in a cop car where it's like, they don't have enough cops
5592760	5594760	and they, they just, they actually do just want people to slow down.
5594760	5595760	They don't want to give tickets.
5595760	5597760	So they just put a mannequin in a cop car.
5597760	5603760	Um, but, uh, and what they found, I think is very interesting, which is that, uh,
5603760	5609760	it is absolutely the bots work, uh, that you'll get, you'll get, you'll get people
5609760	5611760	to backpedal, cool down all these things.
5611760	5617760	If the bot, in addition to doing that has a ton of followers, the, is an absolute
5617760	5622760	direct proportion between like, if the bot has two followers and comes in and
5622760	5624760	says like, Hey, everybody take it easy.
5624760	5627760	They, they just, they're just tinder on the fire.
5627760	5629760	It's just like, fuck another faggot.
5629760	5633760	And if they have a hundred followers, if they have a thousand followers, if they
5633760	5637760	have 10,000 followers, it just gets proportionately, like it's more likely
5637760	5640760	that this person who doesn't know this person because they're a bot, but they
5640760	5644760	have 10,000 illusory followers, the person was more likely to check themselves
5644760	5646760	before they wreck themselves.
5646760	5651760	And, and, and the definition of wrecking yourself is quite simply like everybody
5651760	5655760	has one primal fucking chimpanzee fear, which is you're not going to live on your
5655760	5659760	own. If everybody gangs up on you and decides you're a douchebag, you're going to
5659760	5664760	be in the forest wandering around, trying to figure out as a monkey with an ape
5664760	5668760	with no tail, like how to, how to avoid spotted leopards when you don't even
5668760	5670760	have your friends yelling at you.
5670760	5672760	Uh, you're, you're dead.
5672760	5674760	That's how chimpanzees kill each other.
5674760	5677760	They just send Bob Dole off into the woods.
5677760	5681760	Um, they don't bother to rip their nuts off unless they're young and like trying
5681760	5685760	to start some shit. The old problematic ones, they just go, see ya.
5685760	5688760	Uh, and they, and they go, for real me now?
5688760	5693760	Oh, because to be a chimpanzee and to live alone is to die.
5693760	5699760	And that is why solitary confinement is, you know, torture and et cetera.
5699760	5702760	So, so, so that's the thing.
5702760	5709760	Anonymity, if you, that's, I don't, I think that's, that's fucked up.
5709760	5713760	If you have pure anonymity on the internet, you're, you're taking an end runner
5713760	5717760	on that shit. And I think it's also actually kind of uplifting if you, because
5717760	5721760	you get, you get, you get in arguments with anonymous people and they, they
5721760	5724760	can't help but have an attachment to their ego anyway.
5724760	5731760	Their name is AIDS Spud. I'm here to piss off women's 69 eat your pussy dot fucking fuck you.
5731760	5735760	Um, like, like, like they're just, they couldn't have made a clearer decision that
5735760	5739760	they're, what they're going to do is they're going to go and troll on the internet.
5739760	5743760	It's in the way that you use it. I'm cutting my fucking hair weird and I'm
5743760	5747760	going to get on there with my bird mask and I'm going to fuck up women.
5747760	5751760	And you, you could have a conversation with one of these characters and like,
5751760	5755760	a lot of times like they'll be like, yeah, but what about this? And it's like,
5755760	5760760	wait, what this fucking kid like decided to be absolutely anonymous.
5760760	5763760	They're putting, they're wearing a scream mask and wearing a whole,
5763760	5768760	a running around with a butcher knife. And still a lot of them will defend
5768760	5772760	themselves, which they're like, well, I'm not an asshole. Like,
5772760	5775760	why would you care about that? And when you did all of this,
5775760	5779760	put all this energy in the answer is because of that abs, that fear that
5779760	5784760	unites us, which is fuck. I'm, I don't want to empirically be found
5784760	5789760	out to be a liability to the species because I will,
5789760	5794760	it's like fun is fun and games are games and fantasies of lack of
5794760	5799760	accountability are great. But everybody except sociopaths,
5799760	5804760	like they can be counted on to have that kind of fear.
5804760	5808760	And I guess I'm old, but I'm kind of like, can we start implementing this now?
5808760	5810760	Can, or at least can you please, like,
5810760	5812760	if you're talking to someone who, you know,
5812760	5816760	like their birth certificate is their username, like that's,
5816760	5818760	that's what being famous means. I'm not,
5818760	5822760	my name isn't Mr. Fucking Pickles, dude. I'm like, I'm not doing a character.
5822760	5827760	I'm like a guy. Like I was born in 1973 and the name and the fucking thing
5827760	5832760	and the barcode and the baby footprint. It's my username on Instagram.
5832760	5837760	My girlfriend too. Like I, so you,
5837760	5841760	you're punching down. If you have an account, that's like, uh,
5841760	5845760	stick a pine tree up your pussy to one Oh two four seven three,
5845760	5848760	three, three Trump forever. And you're just like,
5848760	5851760	your girlfriend's a gold digger and you're a piece of shit. And it's like,
5851760	5854760	like, like, like, okay, you, now that you have that power,
5854760	5857760	what are you going to fucking do with it? You, you,
5857760	5862760	you wretched fucking the little shit that I was when I was 11.
5864760	5868760	We were like running across each other's yards back then. It was like, oh,
5868760	5871760	if anybody that said, get off my lawn, they were like, oh, you're evil.
5871760	5872760	My brother.
5873760	5874760	Yeah.
5883760	5887760	What about that? Hey, this is what about a lawn that,
5887760	5891760	what about like a, like a monster house, but the lawn is a,
5891760	5895760	the lawn is a mummy.
5895760	5898760	The lawn is a mummy.
5899760	5902760	Mummy lawn. This guy's a hit maker. Mummy lawn.
5902760	5906760	Mummy lawn. What, why did they mummify the lawn?
5906760	5910760	The grass is mummified the lawn.
5910760	5913760	It's a wrapped, wrapped up in grass.
5913760	5916760	Also the grass is the, is the wrapping. Yeah, man.
5916760	5918760	So, so the, so the, we,
5918760	5922760	we walked by lawns every day and we just think, oh, there's some nice grass.
5922760	5926760	But underneath that grass, it's all mummies, all mummies,
5926760	5929760	or at least that one house, that one house. What about a,
5929760	5932760	what about a Pixar movie called lawns?
5932760	5935760	And each lawn is like a celebrity.
5935760	5940760	And, but there's a lawn that wants to be on another lawn.
5942760	5945760	Is it called the grass is always greener? No.
5945760	5947760	I thought it was called lawns. It's called lawns.
5947760	5952760	It sounds like it's called rape culture because I wish I could be on a lawn.
5953760	5956760	It's not going to work.
5958760	5962760	It's important that I have a place where I can work through these ideas. Yeah.
5962760	5965760	Thank God. I mean, if I, if I was at home thinking about this,
5965760	5967760	I wouldn't have any feedback. I'd be like, well,
5967760	5970760	maybe I should pitch this might end up on CBS.
5970760	5973760	You might end up forced to watch it. Your children might grow up.
5973760	5974760	Right now in Sweden,
5974760	5977760	they're writing all these ideas down and building a studio behind it.
5977760	5979760	What if a, what if a,
5979760	5984760	what if a tree grew upside down?
5984760	5988760	What if it was like, uh, uh, like, what if it w roots?
5988760	5991760	Did you say a, a root root?
5991760	5995760	What if the roots were up in the air and then the tree was, uh,
5995760	5999760	uh, going down into the ground, right? Yeah. Let's call it roots.
6001760	6005760	Okay. All right. Moving on. What about male? What about male?
6005760	6010760	What about male? Like, no one knows the secret life of male.
6010760	6013760	My name, Barry.
6013760	6015760	Like, uh, you know, the,
6015760	6018760	the postmaster drops off the male and then like, like,
6018760	6022760	so then you have like Cliff Clavin's like the voice of a catalog and he's
6022760	6023760	like, Oh boy,
6023760	6027760	I can't wait to get taken up to the dining room table.
6027760	6030760	And then there's like a new character who's like,
6030760	6034760	I'm a citation or something. I don't know.
6034760	6038760	Yeah. You don't really have relationships with your, your male. What?
6042760	6046760	What about a world? Sorry. What? I didn't mean to,
6048760	6050760	trying to be anonymous.
6050760	6055760	What about a world where automobiles are wheels,
6056760	6061760	but instead of the, but they have four little cars. Right. Okay. All right.
6061760	6064760	All right. See this guy, why am I trying to do this? You're the master.
6064760	6068760	This is what I do guys. The car is made of wheels. The cars,
6068760	6073760	the cars are wheels and they have four cars. You call it as wheels. Yeah.
6073760	6077760	Yeah. Each wheel is a car. Yeah. Yeah. Do they,
6077760	6081760	do they have a relationship with the macro car or is it fractal based? Is it like,
6081760	6086760	do the, if you zoom in on the, no, it can't be. What fractal? Well,
6086760	6089760	I mean like if you zoom in on the cars that are the wheels,
6089760	6093760	you're not going to see, you're going to see regular cars, not,
6093760	6096760	not wheel cars. No, they have little legs.
6102760	6106760	Wait. Describe the wheel for me on a car. We see a cargo by,
6106760	6110760	I zoom in on the front left wheel. And what do I, what am I looking at?
6110760	6113760	In front? There are no wheels on the baby cars there.
6113760	6115760	No, I'm talking about, no, I'm talking about like, well,
6115760	6118760	don't do that to yourself. I didn't mean to take it to the, like,
6118760	6123760	like just he, he's original pitch. Okay. Yeah. You got a car,
6123760	6126760	but you know how there's like a, usually there's like a chassis.
6126760	6130760	So picture like a VW Beetle. Gotcha. Now just picture a wheel in place of
6130760	6134760	that. Okay. And then you're like, and then you go, well, what,
6134760	6137760	what the hell? And then you're like, what are the,
6137760	6140760	what are the tires on this thing? Right? So there's four of them, right? Yeah.
6140760	6145760	So each of the four tires on that, on that tire car,
6145760	6149760	you look and then they, they're little Volkswagens. Yeah. Like skates,
6149760	6154760	like a, like a big, a big tire with skates on each side. Yeah.
6154760	6157760	A total of four. And then those, and then those have legs. Well,
6157760	6160760	I don't think you have to do legs. I did that cause you put me in a corner.
6160760	6163760	Yeah. I know. I know. I think, I think that's the thing.
6163760	6165760	It's like, you got to know when to take the drawing away from the kid.
6165760	6169760	You know, okay. So that's, that's where we start. There's a sequel.
6169760	6171760	We could go there. The wheels don't spin.
6171760	6173760	There's just a car at the bottom of each wheel.
6173760	6176760	Well, you call it, you call it opposite day. So everything, you know,
6176760	6179760	like it's, you know, a helicopter would be, uh,
6179760	6185760	the blade is where we sit and our body would spin. Exactly. Right. Yeah.
6185760	6189760	And then in a parachute would open itself up and a person would come out.
6189760	6194760	Right. Right. And then, uh, and then,
6194760	6197760	and then the tree, this could work with your,
6197760	6202760	this could be cinematic universe. The tree grows down, the roots grow up. Oh.
6202760	6208760	And the wheel goes round and round. And, uh, your plants water you. Yeah.
6208760	6212760	Every morning your plant comes over and pour you a little glass of water.
6212760	6219760	Well, everybody's president, except one person that we vote for every four
6219760	6223760	years to not be president. And they get blamed for everything.
6223760	6226760	They're like, all right, everybody let's do this.
6226760	6230760	Why aren't you building that wall and paying for it? They're like,
6230760	6235760	I'm not, I'm not, I'm not president. You better do something. But nobody wants to be,
6235760	6240760	won't nobody wants to be the not president because they have to pay all the taxes
6240760	6244760	for everything. They're like, shit, I don't know. I don't want to be that.
6244760	6247760	Should we do a scene from that movie, uh,
6247760	6252760	opposite day where, uh, Jeff is, uh, Benicio del Toro. Okay.
6252760	6257760	As the curtain. I'm the curtain. Yeah.
6257760	6262760	And it's opposite world. So you know how that goes. Right. Yeah.
6262760	6267760	You're strung across the window and there's a big curtain rod hanging in the middle of you.
6267760	6273760	Uh, I will be Jean-Claude Van Damme, of course, uh, as, uh, as, uh, rollerskate.
6273760	6279760	Uh, that, uh, is just, uh, yeah. Opposite rollerskate. I, we can get into that later.
6279760	6283760	So I'm an opposite curtain. Yeah. Okay.
6283760	6285760	You can make up your own version of it. I'm sorry.
6285760	6289760	No, no. I mean, I'm trying to wrap my Benicio del Toro brain around that.
6289760	6297760	All right. All right. Uh, Rob will, of course, be, uh,
6303760	6308760	Will Smith. I heard from the audience.
6308760	6310760	Two, two light skinned, two light skinned.
6310760	6315760	Well, it's, it's not, there's no such thing. I think you'll find is the moral of this movie.
6315760	6321760	And is that the voice where I might just opposite day, Will Smith?
6321760	6326760	No, you're Will Smith and you're, uh, you're a candle.
6326760	6334760	And, uh, and Brandon is, uh, played by, uh,
6335760	6341760	Rosie Perez.
6341760	6346760	I'm just ready. All right. For Rosie Perez.
6346760	6351760	Uh, and, uh, you're a table.
6351760	6355760	I'm tired of just sitting here.
6355760	6360760	And it's opposite world. So all of those roles are,
6360760	6364760	they're not what you think.
6364760	6368760	And, uh, okay. Uh, there's the Pixar logo.
6368760	6372760	There's that lamp like stomping the eye or whatever, if that still happens.
6372760	6377760	And then, uh, now we're coming through clouds and then, uh, who are you doing?
6377760	6383760	I'm a roller skate and you played by, played by Michael McDonald.
6383760	6389760	I forgot.
6389760	6392760	This is going to be terrible.
6392760	6399760	What a, what a wonderful day to be a roller skate.
6399760	6408760	I like to roll around on my way to home.
6408760	6413760	I am, I am, uh, I am a roller skate wheel
6413760	6418760	that has tiny roller skates for each of four wheels.
6418760	6420760	You saw that coming.
6420760	6423760	But it's dealt out piecemeal so that the audience can start to understand,
6423760	6426760	this world's not normal.
6426760	6429760	Uh, here I go. Going home. Can't wait.
6429760	6432760	Cause it's my birthday. I am Jean-Claude Van Damme.
6432760	6435760	No, I'm not Jean-Claude. He wouldn't identify himself that way.
6435760	6438760	I am, I am, I'm roll, I'm roller skate.
6438760	6442760	Uh, he proceeds up his, uh, stairs to his house.
6442760	6447760	Oh, no, no, no, no, no. He goes down his stairs.
6447760	6449760	Good point.
6449760	6450760	Sorry, sorry.
6450760	6452760	To somebody else's house.
6452760	6453760	Yeah.
6453760	6460760	Time to go down stairs to someone else's house.
6460760	6462760	Lona.
6462760	6466760	That's the opposite of, that's the opposite of hyah.
6466760	6467760	God.
6467760	6468760	Lona.
6468760	6470760	Lona.
6470760	6473760	All right.
6473760	6478760	Hello, it's me, Rollie.
6478760	6483760	Hey, Rollie. I'm just sitting at these people eating my lunch.
6483760	6485760	Oh, opposite table.
6485760	6489760	Yeah. You like my shore shores?
6489760	6492760	We.
6492760	6497760	Uh, guess whose birthday it isn't.
6497760	6503760	What? You don't look a day under.
6503760	6506760	Ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, ting.
6506760	6510760	Oh, don't answer that.
6510760	6513760	This is me.
6513760	6515760	It's like a curtain.
6515760	6518760	I'm outside the window.
6518760	6521760	Somebody open the window so I can be inside.
6521760	6524760	The curtains are outside the window.
6524760	6528760	Because they're opposite.
6528760	6532760	Lona.
6532760	6534760	Whatever you do, don't let them in.
6534760	6537760	I'll do that then.
6537760	6540760	Because I'm your best enemy.
6540760	6545760	Yes, I hate both of you guys.
6545760	6547760	Oh, you do.
6547760	6551760	And by guys, I hate one of you as a guy and one of you as a woman.
6551760	6554760	I'm closing the window, which makes it open.
6554760	6555760	Thank you. Thank you.
6555760	6557760	Hello, curtain.
6557760	6559760	Oh, I hate you so much.
6559760	6561760	Oh, I hate you too.
6561760	6564760	Hey, the phone's just starting to talk for no reason.
6564760	6567760	Without it even being off the handle, it's just talking.
6567760	6570760	Hey, it's me.
6570760	6571760	I'm the candle.
6571760	6574760	I live next door.
6574760	6578760	And I'm burning the wax at both ends here.
6578760	6584760	So I'm just a flame in the middle and there's like wax on both sides of me.
6584760	6587760	If you notice, I'm on the ground.
6587760	6590760	I'm a curtain rod, but I go upwards.
6590760	6591760	That's great.
6591760	6592760	I'm on the phone.
6592760	6593760	I can't see any of that.
6593760	6597760	Don't come over because we're not having a funeral.
6597760	6603760	I want you to be louder.
6603760	6607760	Because I can almost hear my television.
6607760	6610760	So please be louder.
6610760	6611760	Don't come over.
6611760	6613760	We would hate to see you.
6613760	6616760	I will.
6616760	6625760	The phone hangs up and then it rings.
6625760	6628760	I just walked the fuck into the house.
6628760	6634760	That's like the opposite of a candle, to just walk in the house.
6634760	6638760	Well, wait till I leave.
6638760	6639760	And then you'll get it.
6639760	6640760	Hey, you know what?
6640760	6644760	The way you're behaving, like if somebody should kill you,
6644760	6651760	one of these days it's going to be me for you.
6651760	6653760	I'm a curtain.
6653760	6654760	Oh, me for you.
6654760	6657760	It'll be multiple me's for you.
6657760	6659760	Curtains.
6659760	6662760	Well, I'm here again, as I always am,
6662760	6669760	to pick up my mail that was delivered at your place.
6669760	6673760	I'm going to take these mails and leave.
6673760	6678760	And after I leave, I'm going to knock on the door and go.
6678760	6684760	Don't somebody stop this.
6684760	6688760	But then we zoom in on the mail and then now it's the mail spin off.
6688760	6689760	Yeah.
6689760	6694760	Hey, hey, hey, Trader Joe's coupon booklet.
6694760	6697760	What'd you say?
6697760	6702760	How come I'm always tucked inside of you, Trader Joe's coupon booklet?
6702760	6704760	Hey, let me tell you something.
6704760	6706760	Do you know who I am?
6706760	6710760	I'm jury ballot letter.
6710760	6713760	I'm the jury guy that tells you to be on the jury.
6713760	6715760	Hey, I'm Trader Joe's coupon book.
6715760	6716760	Yeah, I know.
6716760	6718760	I'm stuffed inside of you all the fucking time.
6718760	6721760	You two should stop fighting.
6721760	6722760	Oh, no.
6722760	6724760	Listen to me.
6724760	6731760	I am Zena, the Amazon Prime Princess.
6731760	6734760	You guys are making me look so ugly,
6734760	6737760	and all I do is stare at myself.
6737760	6739760	Tis I, Vanity Fair.
6739760	6743760	Vanity Fair, I've been jerking off to you
6743760	6746760	ever since we were putting that mail sack.
6746760	6747760	Me too.
6747760	6752760	I've been jerking off to you since Thursday.
6752760	6754760	And it's Friday.
6754760	6756760	Zena.
6756760	6759760	Zena, I only heard stories about you.
6759760	6761760	I didn't think you actually existed.
6761760	6762760	Yeah, I do.
6762760	6765760	Hey, did you know that cottage cheese is,
6765760	6767760	you get two for one now at Trader Joe's?
6767760	6768760	I did not.
6768760	6769760	I did.
6769760	6773760	Go, go, go, go, go.
6773760	6777760	Hey, what gives with this mailbox?
6777760	6780760	Is it going with the rest of the property?
6780760	6784760	Hey, hey, this is just an old mailbox.
6784760	6788760	No one cares about what's been delivered in it.
6788760	6794760	Just rip it out and take it to the landfill tomorrow at 6.
6794760	6795760	Oh, Zena.
6795760	6798760	Zena, this is our home for the next,
6798760	6800760	maybe a day or so until the person comes up
6800760	6802760	and brings us into the kitchen table.
6802760	6803760	I know.
6803760	6807760	That's too bad old woman withers had a heart attack
6807760	6812760	so no one's gonna ever get the mail inside this thing.
6812760	6815760	You got a stamp on me.
6815760	6816760	That's a sign, right?
6816760	6819760	You put a stamp on me.
6819760	6823760	I don't want to cancel off maternity.
6826760	6828760	You had to lick it then stick it
6828760	6833760	but now we're gonna be in a landfill.
6833760	6835760	Mail story on Fox.
6835760	6836760	Yeah.
6836760	6838760	I like that Opposite World has a self-contained,
6838760	6842760	non-opposite shitty mail Pixar world.
6842760	6843760	Easy to follow mail.
6843760	6845760	It's kind of like the young ones
6845760	6847760	where they would go to the refrigerator
6847760	6849760	and talk to the eggs.
6849760	6850760	I do.
6850760	6851760	The eggs.
6851760	6852760	All right.
6852760	6853760	Oh, we did it.
6853760	6854760	We did it.
6854760	6857760	We did 10 minutes of the worst improv of anybody's life.
6857760	6858760	It's pretty bad.
6858760	6861760	I think that opposite thing was maybe a misguided...
6861760	6863760	Maybe it was the best idea.
6863760	6866760	It's hard to be an opposite curtain.
6866760	6868760	I had my brain kind of frozen.
6868760	6869760	Yeah.
6869760	6871760	I was wondering what you were gonna do with that.
6871760	6873760	I mean, I was outside but then you got to be...
6873760	6874760	Who was your celebrity?
6874760	6877760	I was the worst beneath Yield El Toro of all time.
6877760	6880760	I ended up sounding more like a strong bat
6880760	6883760	from Homestar Runner.
6883760	6884760	Oh, yeah.
6884760	6886760	I was like, oh, well...
6886760	6887760	Look at us.
6887760	6888760	Look at our side.
6888760	6889760	Do we wanna...
6889760	6892760	Maybe a guard your window from the sunlight.
6892760	6893760	We shout out of charity?
6893760	6895760	I don't have a question.
6895760	6896760	Okay.
6896760	6898760	Opposite man doesn't have a question.
6898760	6900760	What wasn't your question?
6900760	6901760	Sorry for interrupting.
6901760	6902760	No.
6902760	6903760	No, you're not.
6903760	6905760	You are so not sorry.
6905760	6907760	Well, this is his opposite.
6907760	6908760	It's opposite world.
6908760	6909760	It means he's not sorry.
6909760	6911760	What's your question?
6912760	6913760	Oh, boy.
6913760	6916760	What's your favorite prank you've ever been given?
6921760	6923760	What's our favorite prank we've ever...
6923760	6924760	That question.
6924760	6925760	That question.
6925760	6926760	I don't know if the mic's picked it up,
6926760	6929760	but his friend or maybe not, maybe just a stranger was like...
6929760	6932760	I was gonna say the wheel sound of that.
6932760	6933760	The wheel sound.
6933760	6934760	I can't even...
6934760	6937760	I was like, uncontrollable derision.
6937760	6939760	Like, oh, my God.
6940760	6942760	I can't keep the mirth from...
6947760	6949760	He just gave up halfway through it.
6949760	6951760	He's like, what's the favorite prank that you...
6951760	6952760	I don't know.
6954760	6958760	Dan, you've been a victim of...
6958760	6961760	What's your favorite prank or least favorite prank
6961760	6964760	that you either have or haven't been either the victim of
6964760	6967760	or have perpetrated on another person or yourself?
6968760	6969760	Yeah.
6971760	6973760	Well, I really don't know what the question is,
6973760	6976760	but I know my favorite prank show of all time was
6976760	6980760	Alan Funt's Playboy Channel prank show
6980760	6983760	because it was so humanistic.
6983760	6986760	None of the marks were ever...
6986760	6990760	They were just poor people that had clearly answered an ad
6990760	6993760	that was like, your job is to come in and answer the phones
6993760	6995760	in this, like, office.
6996760	6998760	And they never...
6999760	7002760	They would come in and they were thinking like,
7002760	7005760	oh, I'm gonna make $5 an hour answering a phone.
7005760	7007760	And then the voice on the other end is Alan Funt.
7007760	7010760	And then a naked woman would come in or something.
7010760	7014760	Just really an impossibly thin amount of variation
7014760	7016760	on the idea of a naked woman coming in
7016760	7019760	and going like, I'm naked.
7019760	7020760	Can I say that?
7020760	7023760	And it was just basically just every man
7023760	7026760	answering the phone, Alan Funt would call and go,
7026760	7029760	hey, what the fuck is going on in there?
7029760	7031760	Let's go, I just want...
7031760	7033760	And then the poor person would just be like,
7033760	7034760	I don't know, she's naked.
7034760	7035760	I don't know.
7035760	7037760	She's naked.
7037760	7039760	What the fuck?
7039760	7041760	What the fuck's going on over there?
7041760	7042760	And it was just...
7042760	7043760	Did we swear like that?
7043760	7045760	Yeah, no, he said fuck every other word.
7045760	7046760	Really?
7046760	7048760	To make it the Playboy Channel worthy.
7048760	7051760	It was like, what the fuck is happening?
7051760	7052760	And it was like Alan Funt's voice.
7053760	7054760	And then after a while they'd go,
7054760	7056760	hey, you're on naked, candid camera.
7056760	7058760	And the person would go, great.
7058760	7059760	And they'd give them more money
7059760	7061760	than they thought they were going to get.
7061760	7062760	I wasn't involved in this one,
7062760	7065760	but our friend Drew Carey, on the Drew Carey show,
7065760	7066760	Drew had like a wrap this season.
7066760	7068760	It was going to go on a vacation.
7068760	7070760	And he had like an assistant
7070760	7072760	and he had his luggage backstage.
7072760	7074760	And I think it was somebody in the prop department
7074760	7076760	on the Drew Carey show, Warner Brothers,
7076760	7081760	took an enormous like foot and a half long rubber dildo
7082760	7086760	and put a bunch of metal screws in it
7086760	7088760	and then put it in his bag
7088760	7090760	so it would set off the metal detector.
7090760	7093760	So when he got through security,
7093760	7094760	hey, I'm Drew Carey.
7094760	7095760	Hey, how's it going?
7095760	7096760	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7096760	7097760	And then they...
7097760	7100760	And they pulled out this giant fucking silto.
7100760	7102760	And apparently Drew, when he came back,
7102760	7104760	didn't talk to anybody in the set for a month.
7104760	7106760	Speaking of pranks though,
7106760	7107760	I guess this fits into the category.
7107760	7109760	We should have Eric Andre on the show.
7109760	7111760	Have you guys watched Eric Andre?
7111760	7112760	Yeah, I bet.
7112760	7114760	Those are one of those shows like Adam Ruins,
7114760	7115760	Everything.
7115760	7116760	I've never watched it.
7116760	7117760	And then Mike McMahon,
7117760	7119760	one day at Rick and Morty's writers room was like,
7119760	7120760	have you seen Eric Andre?
7120760	7122760	So when we started binging Eric Andre,
7122760	7125760	it was like, holy shit, like really funny.
7125760	7127760	But it'd be interesting to...
7127760	7130760	I've chatted with him and stuff at like up fronts,
7130760	7132760	like know who he is, but never,
7132760	7134760	but I think he would be interesting to talk to
7134760	7136760	about the ins and outs of his show.
7136760	7137760	Absolutely.
7137760	7139760	I was season two of Punk'd,
7139760	7142760	so I have 15 pranks on various celebrities.
7142760	7145760	I'm just going to say the time we made Usher...
7147760	7149760	We made Usher write a jingle
7149760	7151760	and told him that his brother had stolen women's clothing
7151760	7154760	from a shop in Beverly Hills.
7154760	7155760	And then we had to say to him like,
7155760	7158760	and this is how we want the jingle to go, Usher.
7158760	7160760	He thought he was writing a jingle
7160760	7162760	to get his brother out of Hock
7162760	7163760	with that place he had shoplifted at.
7163760	7165760	We told him and his brother was there
7165760	7166760	and his brother was like,
7166760	7170760	stole these clothes for these women that I'm trying to see
7170760	7172760	and I'm in trouble.
7172760	7174760	And it was like a Kitson or some shit.
7174760	7177760	And we were like, well, you can get out of this
7177760	7179760	if you sing this jingle for the store.
7179760	7181760	And Usher was like...
7181760	7183760	He looked at his brother and he goes,
7183760	7185760	it's not sexy, man.
7185760	7187760	What you're doing right now in the store
7187760	7189760	stealing clothes is not sexy.
7189760	7192760	As if they had had a discussion prior.
7193760	7195760	Wow.
7195760	7197760	You steal, it's not sexy.
7197760	7199760	You gotta be like Usher's sexy.
7199760	7200760	You're Usher's brother.
7200760	7202760	You're supposed to go out there and be sexy.
7202760	7204760	It's supposed to do sexy things.
7206760	7208760	So, yeah, pranks.
7208760	7209760	Did he write a jingle?
7209760	7211760	He did not.
7211760	7213760	He was like, I will just take the hit.
7213760	7215760	I'll buy the shit.
7215760	7217760	I'll buy the shit.
7217760	7220760	My niece, Stephanie, when she was like maybe five,
7220760	7224760	I was, I don't know, eight.
7224760	7226760	She was staying in the guest room in our house.
7226760	7229760	I went and got under her bed like an hour
7229760	7230760	before she went to bed.
7230760	7231760	Oh, no.
7231760	7233760	Oh, no.
7233760	7235760	This isn't a prank, though.
7235760	7239760	And I tilted the mirror on the wardrobe kind of thing.
7239760	7241760	How old were you?
7241760	7242760	I was probably...
7242760	7243760	Last year.
7243760	7244760	No, no, no.
7244760	7245760	32.
7245760	7247760	I would say I was like nine years old.
7247760	7248760	Okay.
7249760	7250760	The reason I said, oh, no,
7250760	7252760	is because I was picturing you like 30.
7252760	7253760	No, no, no, no.
7253760	7255760	She's only a couple years younger than I.
7255760	7258760	She might have been five, I was seven, six, eight,
7258760	7259760	something like that.
7259760	7262760	And I tilted the mirror on the chest of drawers
7262760	7265760	so I could kind of see up towards the bed.
7265760	7267760	And I was in there for an hour,
7267760	7270760	and it was uncomfortable, and it's cramped.
7270760	7273760	And I used to fuck with her all the time.
7273760	7276760	And she came in and got to bed,
7276760	7279760	and I waited another hour.
7279760	7281760	And there was enough light to the window.
7281760	7284760	And she had a nightlight so I could see that she was there.
7284760	7286760	And I waited until she was like settled in bed
7286760	7288760	because she was like doing a thing and reading a book
7288760	7290760	or playing with My Little Pony or whatever.
7290760	7294760	And then I waited until she was like just about falling asleep.
7294760	7297760	And I was there for two hours.
7297760	7298760	And I went...
7299760	7300760	Oh.
7301760	7302760	Oh, drop down.
7303760	7309760	She leapt 15 feet off the bed, turned the lights on,
7309760	7311760	and I got out of the bed.
7311760	7312760	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
7316760	7319760	That was more terrorizing than it ought to have been.
7319760	7320760	That's fucked up.
7322760	7323760	I remember my brother...
7323760	7324760	Chip, go ahead.
7324760	7329760	Well, my brother, I remember, he wanted to scare my grandma.
7329760	7332760	And he hid down in the basement.
7332760	7334760	So starting off as a good idea.
7334760	7337760	For a really long time, this is my grandma Bunny.
7337760	7339760	She recently passed away, my mom's mom.
7339760	7341760	Is this the one that stabbed the dude?
7341760	7342760	No, no, no, no.
7342760	7343760	That's her mom.
7343760	7344760	Okay.
7344760	7345760	That's Grandma Boucher.
7346760	7351760	But Grandma Bunny, I guess my brother hid down in the basement
7351760	7353760	because he wanted to scare Grandma.
7353760	7356760	And she came down and she was doing laundry
7356760	7358760	and he was just hiding and he was kind of biding his time
7358760	7361760	and then she let the biggest fart out.
7361760	7366760	And then he started freaking out, laughing and crying and stuff.
7366760	7368760	And it was like a delightful story.
7368760	7372760	She was a little scared, but it was funnier.
7372760	7374760	Whatever he was going to do is more...
7374760	7376760	It's like, don't scare an old lady,
7376760	7379760	but it's nicer that she was like...
7379760	7382760	And then he was like...
7382760	7385760	And I was like, yeah, why are you putting all this energy into...
7385760	7387760	The hunters become the hunters.
7388760	7390760	Cliffhanger!
7393760	7394760	Thank you all.
7394760	7395760	We love you.

7404760	7405760	Rob Shrove.
7405760	7407760	The body needs sleep.
7407760	7409760	Also, I wasn't here.
