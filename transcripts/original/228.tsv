0	20520	Happy New Year I missed you all so much it feels like a long time it feels like almost
20520	29600	last year from Hollywood California in the year Anerdomene 2017 Harman Town is now in
29600	30600	session
60600	77600	in town, Ken Harman. Thank you very much. Happy New Year. Hello Jane. Well how about
77600	85640	that Meryl Streep huh? She won something and she made a speech, she made a nice long speech
85640	97480	it was nice. I have no idea what you're talking about. She very very specifically chided Trump
97480	103840	specifically for his mocking of the disabled reporter which really was like kind of the
103840	107160	I don't know I don't want a bunch of women to go like wait what about the grab him the
107160	114040	pussy thing it's not a competition. But she was like you know she's Meryl Streep so she's
114040	118600	like like she said it broke her heart and it's like you know at this point even even
118600	125280	if it was a fake election or even if it wasn't like like like he kind of lost at this point
125280	130040	he kind of like you you'd rather you know if he lost the election Meryl Streep might
130040	137760	like him one day you know like but he won and now he's just damned forever I would rather
137760	144840	not be president and have Meryl Streep like me is what I'm trying to say. Yeah but he
144840	152600	doesn't care he just wants people to say his name out loud he loves it. Yeah thanks that's
152600	163480	a good counterpoint. It's true he does like attention doesn't he? All right well you know
164200	171960	everything that Meryl Streep talked about. What was the award she won? Golden Globe. It's about time
171960	183160	she got one and Donald Glover just found out I was I was because I was scooching through all
183160	186760	these things I don't know what Golden Globes I never care about them but there was a Donald
186760	193240	Glover's show Atlanta won best show as far as the best comedy slash music show and he won best
193240	202440	actor go so congratulations I really really got to check out that show. I really have a lot of
202440	210000	catching up to do on my friend's shows. At a scale of zero to a hundred percent which is what a hundred
210000	218680	means. How much and be honest do you feel responsible for Donald Glover's success? Two percent
218680	223960	because there's absolutely no way he if he hadn't been cast on Community would have been cast in
223960	228200	something else him getting cast on Community was was a result of him sharing a manager with the
228200	235120	Russo brothers Joe Russo was like like look hot tip like forget filling this role of this like
235360	240800	podunk football player guy like just put a star in your show before he becomes globally famous
240800	246080	and he was absolutely right. All of these community actors have gone on to amazing things and
248000	252320	a ton of that credit goes to the Russo brothers for their wisdom in the casting process. They
253280	258240	said do Alice in Brief for sure you know like like and stuff like that like a lot of credit to them
259280	262960	and Donald for sure never it wouldn't have mattered if you hadn't if you hadn't been cast
263040	267360	on Community it would have been it would have been anything else and then that would have been
267360	271200	the place where everybody first saw that he was a genius and then he would have gone and done
272000	276720	Atlanta or whatever I mean the guy is like he's just gonna eat the moon next
277760	281120	eat it and everyone's gonna go I can't believe someone ate the moon it was like well did you
281120	286800	meet Donald Glover? Where is Harmon town gonna go for our colony if he eats the moon?
287040	292960	I'd say we could live on Donald Glover's head. No but no we have to kill Donald Glover.
294960	299040	Let's not make assumptions that's that's that's breaking. You just said he's gonna eat our
299040	304640	colony as a home base. But I broke the third of the four agreements when I said that I made an
304640	311440	assumption. I think that's the one. Is there an assumption about not living on someone's head?
311440	317680	No I made an assumption. What? He proposed that we could live on his head and that seems
317680	322400	I'm not I'm not I'm not judging you're so drunk. I'm not drunk at all. You're not you're not drunk.
322400	327360	All right well well good that I'm really not judging. I'm just concerned about you now.
331120	338480	Uh you're drunk. Now my voice is scratchy so I'm going to kind of come in and out vocally.
338800	348880	Oh okay all right well I uh I uh I have a scratchy voice too so it's gonna take me a second to pull
348880	354080	up my notes. I thought you're gonna say I apologize but that was never gonna happen.
355520	361280	Well what did I I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I accused you of being drunk. Okay. Is that what
361280	372080	I did wrong? That's for starters. I was dismissive of you as a person. Yes. Which is bad. Agreed. Makes
372080	377680	you feel bad and uh I and it also breaks one of my four agreements which is I was not impeccable
377680	383600	with my word. I used my word to just you create black magic instead of white magic which seems
383600	391120	racist. A racist distinction but maybe the maybe the fifth agreement is be racist and the guy just
391120	396480	left that out of the book because he knew it's sell mark copies. I don't know. He talks a lot
396480	403840	about black magic and white magic. I'm like careful. But at any rate uh I cast some black
403840	410640	magic on you. Bad magic. Sorry it won't happen again. Well I can't I can't make assumptions.
412320	416000	I will try to make it stop happening. I'm working on it. I'm in therapy.
416000	427120	Let's see Meryl Streep. Are you drunk? No no not yet. I mean I'm gonna get drunk up here.
428880	436640	All right well so I mean just you know politics corner like. So Spencer. Hey guys.
436640	449040	Whoa you're drunk. No man no. Isn't it isn't it perfectly feasible to accept election results
449840	455120	and also want the winner investigated for treason? Like like can't you can't you just why is it
455120	461040	every time it's like this is a big deal like it's it's it's the intelligence community say
461040	464880	okay yeah there was a there was an order to interfere there was all these things like
465680	472640	I know what now the only thing left to do is to ask who knew what and when if there was collusion
472640	477680	it really doesn't matter. Yeah if for instance Roger Stone was tweeting evidence of collusion
477680	482880	with Julian Assange before the WikiLeaks leaks dropped that would be very highly interesting
482880	492000	for you know maybe people to know. Yeah. Like if he if he for instance tweeted three separate times
492720	498720	you know like weird things that alluded to the fact that Julian Assange is looking to leak
498720	502960	helpful stuff to his campaign and that they were going to win the election for it that might be
502960	508320	really you might be able to build a case off of something like that. I need I need something
508320	513200	that's more just I would like to maybe take up just a peek at the tax forms. Yeah no I'm just
513200	518560	saying just as a starting point on public record where I mean that's just you know that should
518560	524560	that alone should be like yeah let's investigate this whole fucking thing. Yeah because didn't we
524560	529040	put people to death because they told some people about some stuff with the atomic bomb I mean we
529040	534160	take treason very seriously still. Yeah it's treason we call it treason. Yeah it's a bad word
535680	540880	and it says it doesn't but if you say anything like well this seems bad we should look into this
540880	545920	what you get back is yeah but emails and I'm like okay but that election's over
545920	553680	kid or are you a Russian troll bot now but but like like okay so that election is over
553680	560720	we just need to now know preferably before the inauguration does he belong in prison like it's
560720	569200	congratulations you won that now I need to see all of your tax information from the year 1987 when
569200	574480	you were going over to Russia to talk about building hotels all the way through you you
574480	579520	know marrying your Czechoslovakian wife and I mean it's common knowledge he can't he can't borrow
579520	585520	from American banks he had he is tied up in Russian financial assets and that's that's just
585520	591120	we know that we can't prove it but everyone knows that and it's like that might very well lead
591120	596560	exactly it might say like Putin like personal check it might say that there might there might
596560	601440	be okay so isn't this all the government I mean what can't you just now at this point if all the
601440	605520	intelligence agencies say yeah this is a thing can't you now just even you don't even have to
605520	610400	subpoena can't you just walk across the hall to the IRS and take something from one cabinet
610400	615120	and put it in another cabinet yeah you would think you certainly would think also in a world
615120	623600	where you can hack everything somebody hack this motherfucker to hack him up like how do we get our
623600	630000	best people are our worst people on the job and hack his tax returns most people believe that
630000	635680	that probably has happened long ago either at the same time as the I mean because what better
636960	641280	all the better I mean that's just pure speculation at this point but it also just makes perfect sense
641280	648080	from a game theory perspective uh to just like go okay now we have all the you know the all of the
648080	653280	information on them as well and now you just have a president like it's it's like it's a crazy like
653280	658000	sci-fi novel but I don't want to go that far because it's like it gets tangled up in this
658080	662880	thing where people think that you're trying to say he's not allowed to be president no fairsies do
662880	669600	oversies I'm not saying that I just want to know if my new president belongs in prison yet
670640	676320	I I'm a firm believer in the I think it's the 13th amendment which is no cuts no buts no coconuts
681280	686640	and it's insane that 20 amendments later women were we got the coconuts why why was that
687440	696800	why we were so backward as a people it's like uh all right so yeah so I almost almost uh
696800	702720	drowned in Fiji but uh cody saved me wait I didn't I didn't hear about this I was with you
702720	706560	for a week in New York I didn't know that you almost died well it wasn't like I mean it was
706560	712800	to be expected like like when you look at me and imagine me walking into the ocean like what do you
712800	718640	think is gonna happen so I didn't think it was like big news I was like it'll be like if I went
718640	723680	on a roller coaster I was like I got pretty sick and I wouldn't like even tweet that I'd be like
723680	731360	but not to be diminishing you you seem buoyant which is what Cody can say is shirring me she's
731360	737120	like you'll float you'll float and I'm like noted but I'm dying like like I swear it was just like
737120	741600	muscle to like weight or so I don't know it's like I just kept she's like a little bean and she
741600	748400	fucking like zips so we're not snorkeling and she's like like a UFO and I and I let you when she
748400	754160	was a little speck I was like cody cody you're too far I got that I came out a little bit more
754160	757760	and I was like my flippers aren't touching the sand that's my deal breaker and snorkeling
760240	763680	I need flippers flipper tips to touch sand I'm not a pussy
765520	769600	I'm not saying I need to be able to stand up and have my head above I just need to be able to
769600	777760	graze the the sand with my flipper tips uh and and when that stuff our tips go whoop whoops
780800	784560	that's only in the morning you're supposed to be making breakfast
787920	790400	that's like an alarm clock uh
793120	796800	uh it's just for decoration man
797760	802240	that's that's that's all man all right all right come on all right we're dating ourselves
803360	808880	we are oh how romantic I know next next thing we'll be talking about techno viking
809520	814720	uh these these kids they they they their first memory is the okay go video
817440	820000	it was playing in the in the maternity ward lobby
820000	827520	uh so anyway yeah so I was uh I was uh yeah I was I was floating and and I got I was like
827520	831440	I saw her little head I'm like well if my flippers can't touch the end and she's in she's in shark
831440	835760	world and I was like you should come back and she's like zip okay zip and then she went over
835760	840720	and I was like all right that's good now that that's done I'll just go join her and by doing
840720	848080	this for like 20 minutes look at the look at the sand underneath it's so great to have a snorkel
848160	851200	as they can breathe and then I just look up and I'm like in the same spot
852560	859120	and she's just and then I was like cutting after a while because I was like I started I said I'm
859120	866560	starting to panic I said don't panic I am already I would have I waited until I started to say
866560	872400	something and she's like and I was like and then I just started I was like at a certain point that
872400	876160	she she goes whoops she comes over and she's like just paddle and I'm like I've been paddling and
876160	882880	I'm yelling at her I'm like this is how people die this is how they die and and and she says
884240	888640	I finally I got to a point I swear where I said go on without me and here's why
890640	895280	because I was that convinced I was actually dying like believe me if I thought I had a chance at
895280	904560	survival I would have risked killing her trying to live I'm not a hero I just was so certain I
904560	910800	she couldn't save me I didn't want to die and also have her blood on my hands so I was like
910800	915360	just go like like like I'm I don't want to die an extra guilty death I just want to feel bad
915360	920400	about everything I've eaten and and while I slowly sink to the bottom the four foot four foot
922240	926640	ocean floor just one flipper length away from the bottom of the ocean
928000	933920	but oh by the way a crab crawled on my fucking body I before I got up there that should have
933920	937840	been an omen I shouldn't have gone out there there was there there was you know there's sticks
937840	943200	and shit it's all beautiful it's crystal blue ocean and you can see the ground through it and
943200	949360	and and but then it'll be like a diaper and uh I don't know I won't assume it's like negative
949360	953760	parents almost something it's like a like a like an adventurous kid or something it's like uh but
953760	958000	but but but like sticks and like moss you try to steer clear the debris and then some shit hits
958000	961920	you and you're like uh and then there was like a thing it was like like like a little tickle thing
961920	967120	and I was like yeah what is that and then I turn around like what the hell was that tickle there's
967120	972880	this fucking crab going what are you doing and I was like ah but you're moving in water and you
972880	979120	can't I'm like the titanic and he's like a little dicaprio like he's just moving I didn't see the
979120	985200	movie but I assume the physics involved in a which was part of the plot it's like it's like
985200	990480	moving towards me because so I'm trying to like try trying to do like like the dune blade thing
990560	995600	where it's like I move slow so that the I can get oh but the crab is faster he's like and he wants
995600	1000720	to be on me and I don't know why and then he crawled back on me again and I take out my snorkel
1000720	1007680	my breathing apparatus I'm like okay and then I hear this laughing and it's these uh four
1007680	1011840	fijian kids who are like 20 feet away and they're just laughing and pointing and it actually made
1011840	1017440	me feel better because because they're fijian people they're very very nice and children of
1017440	1021680	course as we all know are wonderful uh but they weren't like I don't think they were like they
1021680	1026880	weren't like ha ha he's gonna die so I was they were like ha ha that must be a crab like they
1026880	1031520	could tell from my movements it was like look at like for his first crab or something and I was like
1031520	1038880	oh if that's a bit here then I'm safe they they look like fucking cartoon crabs it's
1039360	1044240	it's like a goddamn uh uh deep fried soft shell crab but it's alive
1049120	1053280	wait try to paint the picture from it's like
1056080	1063120	it's it's crab shaped yeah yeah okay so then I get out there and I'm gonna die and then I was
1063120	1066320	like Cody's like trying to haul me in I'm like you're just gonna kill yourself just get out of
1066320	1070800	here and she's like Dan just just grab I know what you thought you're gonna take her down with
1070800	1075520	you yeah yeah okay that's why I said go on without me because that's what they teach you in a swim
1075520	1081920	class like I took a swim class I mean in gym they said like don't if somebody's drowning you know
1081920	1086400	you gotta know how to save people a certain way if you're a lifeguard because people just drowning
1086400	1091120	people will just kill you they're just they're just weapons in the water they don't even know
1091120	1094400	they'll kill you as soon as look at you because they're drowning they're just they they've been
1094720	1099440	they're like 28 days later person they don't they don't even know who you are they're just
1099440	1104080	trying to stay above water and if you go out to them they'll try to climb on top of you
1104080	1108000	and then they'll and then and then they'll like I need four more people so I can stand
1109520	1114720	and then they'll be like Josh oh they'll feel terrible but there'll be too late for Josh and
1115600	1121280	don't be a Josh is what they said those are the poster and the uh lifeguard lifeguard class that
1121280	1128640	I took so I said go on without me but then what I did is she did like a little frog stroke thing
1128640	1134160	and I just I just grabbed her little butt and she just slowly towed me into shore
1135760	1139520	and I was like well if I yeah I just die just squeezing this little tushy
1140080	1143680	it was nice it was nice she was right I wasn't really anywhere near death ever
1145440	1149360	but it's the thought that counts I think with near-death experiences if you think that you're
1149360	1157760	dying then then that's because yeah it's it that doesn't count with murder but with death near death
1157760	1162720	experience the thought does count the thought doesn't count with murder attempted murder the
1162720	1172960	thought counts in the eyes of the law right so anyways so I'm glad you're alive that would have
1172960	1180640	been a terrible way to die yeah yeah I saw this I saw this like forensic files or something where
1180640	1186560	a guy like a guy like took three women out on a boat and he just had his way with him I saw that
1186560	1191360	one you saw that one yeah I've seen them all and then and then and then just cinder blocks and
1192480	1198320	fuck it that's that's the worst way to die right like being alive and being thrown overboard with
1198320	1202240	a thing you know yeah that's fucked up that's gotta be the worst and also what you're shaking
1202240	1210560	your head no no no no Steve Levy has better way Steve Steve just going like this he's like no no
1210560	1216080	anti-aircraft round shot from the 300 meters uh through your gallbladder you'll you'll die over
1216080	1220240	three days like he has some dark thought in him the thing about if I'm if I'm remembering that
1220240	1227680	forensic files uh well enough it was they didn't all go over at once like one girl watched them
1227680	1235360	all go over like she knew she was next it's not just oh I'm not and I will pass out in 30 seconds
1236240	1241040	she watched the whole thing go and that's fucked up yeah she's like she's like he's not gonna do
1241040	1248160	that and then bring me into shore and like so tell me about yourself like one per own like in
1248160	1254000	Argentina like during during his reign when they had dissidents there the way that they got rid of
1254000	1258720	people they would fly a plane up and everyone that was on the ground saw the plane they know
1258720	1263520	what's happened they'd fly him over the river and they would just toss you out of the plane
1263520	1267840	but they didn't just fly you up and toss you up they flew you around for a while and they blindfold
1267840	1272640	you and the plane was full of just piss and shit because everybody's emptying their bowels because
1272640	1280240	they know what's going to happen perhaps he's wondering why you'd shoot a man before throwing
1280320	1283440	them all to the poor that's a little bane
1287280	1294720	batman 3 a little movie called batman 3 that's from i mean little finger fucking got it in that
1294720	1302480	plane right or wait was that little yeah that was little finger yeah yeah yeah oh what a show what a

1337760	1343680	stuff and uh so i asked at the resort i had no plans on stepping off of the resort but i and i
1343680	1347840	also was curious is this a place where you can step off the resort i'm not a worldly man i'm not a
1347840	1352880	geopolitical expert i dropped out of college i don't know so i asked the the driver uh all the
1352880	1357520	way from the airport because the airport was either under a lot of construction or maybe it's
1357520	1364960	a third world country uh and i i safer to assume the latter um i didn't see any part in our dust
1364960	1372800	signs um and i didn't see any portraits of anybody that looked democratically elected
1372800	1379520	um so i asked a few questions on the on the ride to the resort i said i said like so how does the
1379520	1385680	government work here it was like uh oh it's a democracy like here all right uh how is it well
1385680	1390240	what do you what do you have like a president was a president and a prime minister uh what so how
1390240	1397520	often you have elections oh every four or five years why why does it change sometimes
1398720	1403200	well we're in a little bit of a transition okay all right okay that's all i needed to hear but
1403200	1406480	then i heard some more they're in the military and they're their buddies the prime minister
1406480	1411360	and the president they uh they they kind of they they run things and uh they run a tight ship over
1411360	1415680	there so so i'm like i don't that doesn't really tell me i was i was like well are we are tourists
1415680	1419840	safe like you're driving through these neighborhoods it's like it's not like it's it's like
1419840	1425840	it's there's definitely poverty but you're not seeing like crime poverty it's not like broken
1425840	1432320	windows it's just like poverty so which is a is a is a thing that my western brain is kind of like
1432320	1438240	not the the the purpose the the big part of the story is that i'm not really able to compute that
1438240	1443440	yet like i when if i see certain physical characteristics of a building or a vehicle
1443440	1447680	or something like that i i'm immediately feeling like i'm in danger and this is like a
1447680	1453840	pretty broke place if you're not on a resort and uh and so i was like yeah we'll probably just stay
1453840	1458160	in the resort the whole time so i go up to the bartender at the at the resort and what so what's
1458160	1465440	the deal with the kava thing what's the kava situation oh they do this thing i'm like okay
1465440	1470400	it's like a gimmick here and like this like kava and and then he's like he says the guy and then
1470800	1476720	another guy another guy says like oh you have to do it in a ritual okay sure um just say it's
1476720	1482480	beer pong you can say the same thing and and and it's like oh well there's another ritual oh
1482480	1485360	there's no ritual scheduled because it's the holidays or something like that or you'll have
1485360	1490240	to schedule and talk to my boss or something so i'm like and i go to cody and i say we have to
1490240	1496320	schedule a ritual if we want to do kava is that well and uh and then we we and then the the pool
1496320	1504880	boy is like do you want to do kava i'm like yes pool boy i do and uh and he says you you you you
1504880	1512480	you can do kava with with me and and my family and i'm like okay pool boy please go on and uh
1512480	1515440	and he's like well you could do it here but if you want it do you want to do it in the village
1515440	1518800	and and cody's like yeah you're supposed to do it in the village that's what i heard do it in the
1518800	1524400	village and i'm like okay well well how would we do it in the village well you know i'll pick you
1524400	1530640	up like let's say i get out of here like seven uh eight oh it's like half past eight meet me uh
1530640	1536480	i'll just meet me outside and i'll i'll take you to my uh my neighborhood and we'll we'll do kava
1536480	1539680	and uh and go in the back in the back because the front is like
1542480	1548000	but he's like like everyone in Fiji has this like it just radiates with this like this joy this
1548000	1554000	like friendliness which if you don't trust them makes it seem like the first act of an Eli Roth
1554000	1559680	movie like like like like like like like the the not the Eli Roth movies are famous for their
1559680	1565680	structure i just liked but they do have first acts thresholds are crossed and before they are
1565680	1570320	people are like yay it would take our shirt off and laugh have fun and then everyone's happy and
1570320	1581120	then there's these welding torches and things so uh like he has an oeuvre okay uh so so so so so
1581120	1585120	he's like very and i made a couple jokes because i'm like like i don't want to i don't want to be
1585120	1591760	offensive that would be an awful thing but i do also want to say out loud if i'm gonna die like
1591760	1597120	we're not gonna die are we and so i did and he's like come on it's Fiji man come on i'm not trying
1597120	1600880	to do their accent it's like part Jamaican part like i don't know something else like it sounds
1600880	1606880	like they're just it's islandy and joyful and it's all smiles and just relax and so you don't know
1606880	1612480	you're just thinking like i'm gonna die so you're doing you're doing village kava not pool boy

1640000	1645440	that we're getting into the pool boy's car undercover of darkness off of the resort
1646240	1653440	passed a sign that says don't do this uh by a bridge where there was a dog eating we don't
1653440	1661680	know what it could have been another dog um the dog was stoked but that could be because
1661680	1667360	you know he won i don't know if he was he was he was friendly but he he licked cody and she she
1667360	1673280	was like oh he's so cute oh oh it was like like like a rat licked her you know like like like
1673280	1677760	it was like he was he was he was vermin like we think dogs are man's best friend but they're

1684400	1692800	dogs you know you should have a travel show like so we go out to that we go out to the bridge but
1692800	1698000	the place where they say don't it just says it says don't don't go past this that signed the resort
1698000	1702960	well they're biased you know of course they want you to stay there yeah yeah it's their money so
1703600	1707920	um but also that's the same sign they'd have there if you were going to die remember the crocodile
1707920	1711200	that everyone blamed the family for you know they're an alligator or whatever it's like oh
1711200	1715280	there was a sign that said don't don't go over here in disneyland and they went and the alligator
1715280	1717120	ate their kid and everyone's like there was a sign
1721600	1724400	fucking don't side with a corporation if a lizard eats your kid
1729280	1734640	can we have one fucking rule before we all blow ourselves up can we can we can we go out not
1734640	1741040	having sided with lizards do we have to do we have to get that low before we die it's like i'm
1741040	1748400	with the lizard let the lizard finish hear him out i'm just saying there was a sign chop chop
1753760	1760000	uh so you and cody are in the backseat of a guy's car so we get to the thing and we get it it's
1760000	1765360	like and then the guy's like he's not showing up and like part of me is like you know like good
1765360	1771440	like now i don't look like a pussy in front of cody but also we're not going to die so like we
1771440	1776160	waited a half hour and it's like even there's a whole thing fiji time fiji time man fiji time
1776160	1780400	it's like this joke it's like look if you have a name for it there's like t-shirts that say
1780400	1783760	fiji time it's like a whole thing where it's like oh if you order a drink you get it a half hour
1783760	1790000	later how long did it take you to make the t-shirt fucking just make the drink not the t-shirt
1791520	1797200	don't be proud of it they're not a tip motivated culture jeff um
1799920	1804720	all that anxiety that makes us shoot each other in the in the in the states you know it's it's
1804720	1809360	that that's that's the dark side of the coin that results in a little hustle when you order your
1809360	1814720	drink you want everyone everyone's freaking out like they got shit to do then you go to toronto
1814720	1819760	and they're like grilled cheese all right if i feel like it and you go to australia and they're
1819760	1824720	like good day but good good morrow here's your drink whoa i ordered this yesterday it was a good
1824720	1831920	day like like so i don't know i tried to riff a thing uh i'm a world traveler now everyone's slow
1831920	1838640	except america when you order your drink that's all i'm gonna say about that uh the so so so so
1838720	1844320	we we so we there's nothing coming so we go okay good let's just go watch forensic files
1844320	1850000	so i can continue to be relaxed and uh and let's just like let's just lay in a bed and we'll we'll
1850000	1856560	there's there's birds and things that are a little alarming but whatever so what was kava
1857760	1859600	so then there's so then there's headlights
1861920	1865760	oh there's headlights oh guys there's headlights and then it's like that makes it even scarier
1865760	1869840	because now you really feel like you're in this fucking eli roth movie because there's this moment
1869840	1874240	that the director put in where you could have lived if you just hadn't fucking walked back
1874240	1877840	you had every way to just walk away and there were headlights and then we all go and i just
1877840	1883920	like slammed like so bummed out i'm like all right let's go and it's just a fucking like shitty
1883920	1889360	shitty car pulls up just dude and then also there was just like dudes in the bushes like
1889360	1895760	they had always been there i was like i i thought i thought that was the dog coughing the whole
1895760	1902080	time but it was just like six people going like like like it was like they were just
1902080	1906960	just came out of the bushes to freak us out as we entered the car even though they weren't with the
1906960	1911920	people in the car but they like the the pool boy gets out and he's like it's with a guy he doesn't
1911920	1916240	introduce he's smoking a cigarette and he's just like they just open the doors and and and and and
1916240	1929120	and the pool boy is like okay you ready and i'm like yeah and then we get in the car and i'm just
1929120	1935920	like hanging on to that thing you never hang on to not because they're driving fast but just because
1935920	1940240	i'm like it's just something you do when you're freaked out like you're just like choo choo
1940880	1947440	and i just they're playing music and they're strangers and it's like if you if if these if
1947440	1951920	the physical realities of what we were doing were happening in the states you'd be like i'm
1951920	1955440	i think i'm in i might be in big trouble here and you're trying to think like
1955440	1963120	am i am i carrying bigoted first world you know contaminated toxicity into this situation
1963120	1970960	is this a story about me being an ignorant white like freaking uh pig-headed like judgmental
1970960	1976320	toxic person or is this going to be one of those stories where it's like what were they thinking
1976320	1980320	you know like like like like the editors of Dateline would be like this doesn't even merit an
1980320	1991600	episode like just send it to uh whoever replaced bob saget if there's video assuming there's some
1991600	1997360	video involved because i think it'll be funny because they deserved it because they didn't
1997360	2000800	listen they went to a they went to a different country they just got in a stranger's car like
2000800	2006880	fuck them like is this are we in an urban legend or are we the like urban legend are we the fucking
2006880	2010960	dumb shitheads because but so i'm trying to split the difference and i'm just so i'm being just
2010960	2016800	silently terrified um and and not going you're not gonna kill us right and uh and and and and
2016800	2021360	cody's just talking and going like so what so do you have family i'm like i'm thinking good
2021360	2031360	smart cody smart she humanize them um and yeah yeah i have a daughter i have a what's your
2031360	2036560	daughter's name good genius cody genius uh it's it's it's maryann and then my wife's name is such
2036560	2042480	as good good good good so that way so so it's like a half hour drive and he's and he says like
2042480	2046560	oh and then first you have to go buy the cava you have to let you go this like it's just like
2046560	2051520	this liquor store it's just made out of chicken wire and it smells like a diaper and as i and
2051520	2055440	you just and then you just you get like a big case of shitty beer and you get like that you
2055440	2059520	pay them and it's all like pre-arranged anyway it's like all the prices are they just get a big
2059520	2068160	newspaper bundle full of this root that is mystical um and uh i'll take i'll take a newspaper
2068160	2076240	load of mystical roots and uh some jolly ranchers and uh uh a mickelobe ultra and then and then you
2076240	2079600	and then you and then you get back in the car you go to the thing and he goes like when we pull up to
2079600	2084480	the house my whole family's gonna come out and they're gonna be standing out there and they're
2084480	2088880	gonna say bulla bulla and when you get out just say bulla bulla you're gonna love it it's gonna be
2088880	2093840	great you're gonna love my family man and then they and we pull in that's how you get killed and uh
2093840	2101280	uh and there's just like uh there's just we pull in and there's just like a dude by a mailbox and
2101280	2106800	he's smoking a cigarette he sees the car and he like makes a gesture at the guy i think and then
2106800	2112480	the other the driver's like oh and then the other guy's like oh he says something uh i made that
2112480	2119280	sound like ala akbar didn't i uh the the the there's just like there's just guys it's not
2119280	2124160	like there's no family outside this like texas chainsaw massacre hut that it's just like it
2124160	2128000	there's just guys in the darkness that you can only see them because they can't stop smoking
2128000	2132480	there's just like little orange clothes that just and then they're gone and then you just see like
2133200	2138000	darting eyes and like fucking they step out and i'm like there's no family out here we're
2138000	2142320	like we step out and there's like one dude comes out and we're like bulla bulla
2142320	2153040	uh and then we and then we go into the house what oh there was a fucking tomb yes there was
2153920	2158400	i think it was a tomb there was a guy there was like a memorial like plaque on top of a
2158400	2166080	six foot by two foot by three foot high like cement rectangle that like had to be a tomb
2166640	2174560	i anyways the the the but wait so we so we walk into the into the place and there's his whole
2174560	2179120	family and and there's like his wife and their beautiful little girl and everyone's like
2180320	2184560	it's like it's fucking fine everything's fine because i am a bigot and a asshole and a fucking
2184560	2189520	jerk um because immediately it was just like you could see the expression on their face and then
2189520	2192640	they had a bowl out and they were they knew we were coming and they couldn't wait and all this
2192720	2197120	shit and it was just like they just i was just like oh fuck and it's the crazy thing is how
2197120	2206000	quickly how sure i could be that man is evil you know that there's no there's no fucking way i
2206000	2210400	just all the calculations i was doing in the car on the way there i was like like like i just kept
2210400	2216240	thinking like well there's no way we're gonna die because he'd never get away with it
2216240	2223440	there would be no profit in it so he wouldn't be he wouldn't that would be stupid to kill us
2223440	2227200	and then the thing that started freaking me out was like who says criminals aren't stupid
2227200	2232400	like what if it's his first murder like what did that happens all the time the prisons are
2232400	2237120	overflowing with bad murderers like like they're just bad at it they're just dumb they're just
2237120	2241280	like i'm gonna try killing a bunch of people and see if that will make me a bunch of money
2241280	2248640	and they they're wrong but that's of no comfort to the victims anyways what i what i never bothered
2248640	2254480	to think during the entire car ride was oh we're not going to die because man is good like like
2254480	2259760	it's actually all that stuff that you are always running your mouth about as a hippie and a liberal
2259760	2265120	and a and a nerd and a you know it's like like oh that all that stuff's actually true and if there's
2265120	2268480	an island small enough you'll find that out because there's like a million people that live
2268560	2274480	there and they're just like happy and don't really they don't fucking think about murdering
2274480	2277760	people all the time it's just not something that runs through their head so they're neither good
2277760	2281440	nor bad at it nor do they ever think to even bother to say by the way i know this looks like
2281440	2285520	a murderer car but it doesn't they wouldn't think that they wouldn't be like looking at their car
2285520	2292000	and going like come on jacob make it look less murdery uh spray the hubcaps a little there's
2292000	2301360	murder dust on them um the the you know murdery um so so so like i never thought about that with
2301360	2308000	the weird thing is how convinced i was that i was going to die and how how how specific my map of
2308000	2314400	the universe was how definite it was the really weird thing is that how it took eight seconds
2315120	2321920	for it to go completely away and that how comfortable i was with being that wrong
2322560	2327520	how how i immediately then was like oh yeah yeah then there's then there's that other version of
2327520	2333440	the universe that you're also 100 convinced is real that where where where shit bad shit doesn't
2333440	2336960	happen you just have you know it was that that was the weird thing about the experience was like
2337600	2343440	like looking within myself and going like wait do i even have a brain do i even have an identity do
2343520	2349520	i have a point of view like am i is this country just like are we just like uh are we just like
2349520	2356000	unimprinted unindoctrinated drones that are like spit out of like a like a like a little metal like
2358400	2358640	dish
2363200	2367600	like we're kind of like the start of the show calling me drunk we're kind of we're kind of
2367600	2373280	intentionally i i didn't know drunk was an insult to you like i have a scratchy voice
2373280	2378080	and i'm like i'm so i'm being inarticulate all right well i was just making a joke i've said
2378080	2381840	it on stage before like hey man are you drunk and sometimes you've been like you bit your tits
2381840	2392240	like i just thought it was you know i didn't know i didn't know man all right uh so so but so then
2392240	2397200	it was then they they sang us a song it was it was amazing night like wait no that's what's the
2397200	2401600	song yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah they get up and sing a number yeah yeah they sang it they sang us a
2401600	2406320	song i got i have the i have a recording of it and uh the but the uh but it was it was a great
2406320	2410400	night it was like and so some of some of the like most valuable things that they i got from them
2410400	2413920	because it was like again we started talking about politics and they were like yeah like it's not
2413920	2419840	good here right now like politically but it's not a fijian's job to um to deal with that shit like
2419840	2424000	we we do what we're told just like to just say this shit that like as americans we just go like
2425120	2428640	it's almost like you get mad at them like you're like fuck you like you're like you're like it's
2428640	2434960	like a it's like it's like we think you're a bad person if you don't figure out who to be mad at
2434960	2440720	and what to do about it and yet we're not really getting anywhere with that like like and and i'm
2440720	2447280	not saying they're flying around like jetsons like like they're not they're living in plywood
2447280	2451840	lean twos and then they're and they're saying and they're saying things like they like when
2451840	2455760	you say it's beautiful here they always say thank you would you say that if you were like it's like
2455760	2460400	like every every western kind of like go to london and they go like that's beautiful here the londoner
2460400	2467360	goes like they always go like they go thank you like they like you complimented them because
2467360	2473680	they're very proud of how they live in paradise and they and they all like they they they just
2473680	2476960	do this thing or they keep talking about i don't know if it's a talking point that was like
2478000	2482240	sent down to everybody where they keep going because you hear it on the airplane and then
2482240	2486960	you hear it from the driver and then you hear it it just keeps coming up like by the way thank
2486960	2492080	you so much your tourism dollars like are really helpful here that's like that's maybe 80 percent of
2492080	2496640	their economy like like like they might have one or two agricultural products and then tourism is
2496640	2501600	the main revenue there so they're quite happy to have like tourists there yeah because otherwise
2501600	2505280	they'd be working in the sugar cane fields as they say but but it's like there's still no reason to
2505280	2510400	like in my mind to thank me because as i explained to them i'm like i don't want to bum you out but
2510400	2515600	you probably know i didn't come here to do you a favor like also i thought most of you are murderers
2516880	2520480	i did tell them that i mean i've been telling them yeah before they murdered me
2523440	2528160	but they were so uh yeah and they i don't know they're just like when you when you have troubles
2528160	2531600	like they lift you up or something like that i can't remember it i should have written it down
2531600	2538880	but um they said something really inspiring um and then they they they they they they
2538880	2542240	it's all about the people and it's all about how you react to things you know like if you're
2542240	2547200	if you're having a shitty time if you as a culture as a tribe as a village as a as a country like
2547200	2554080	it's it the thing that defines you is not whether you fight it whether you don't whether you say
2554080	2560880	something right or wrong it's it's just just how you face that thing like who you are when you
2560880	2567520	either go down or prevail like and and the way to make sure you're on the right side of everything
2567520	2574480	is to side with people as to starting with your family then very close second your entire village
2574480	2581840	because they are your family and then your entire species as a close third um if not tied for second
2581840	2585840	and if that means that bad guys are going to take advantage of you and say oh now we own this and
2585840	2591520	you get to live in a tire swing well okay then then then that's what they do and it's like it's
2591520	2597600	not like oh let's all go do that like you know but but it's all it was also like oh geez like
2597600	2602720	there's really there's really only one wrong way to handle what we're dealing with right now in
2602720	2612080	this time in our world and that's to be like to let them make us pissy like while we're going down
2612080	2618800	or up like if whether we win or lose if we if we got too fucking uncharismatic while we were doing
2618800	2623840	it like then they would have won that victory too and it's like just sucks because that you
2623840	2630960	just get the sense that a big part of this war that we're in right now is it's between dumb people
2630960	2636080	and smart people it's between uncool people and cool people and like they they are a little sick
2636080	2641680	and tired of all the cool smart people running everything and they're actually openly saying
2641680	2646880	that so you got to think i think they're i think they're already lost and they know that and that
2646880	2651680	makes them the most dangerous opponent of all if we continue to be surprised that they won't listen
2651680	2657040	to reason if we just got to like look at this as like there's a fucking werewolf in our house is
2657040	2662480	it just like there's just something like vermin dog just wandered in the we spent the we spent the
2662480	2668320	days after the election going like okay well are we gonna handle this like we forgot the rust belt
2668320	2672480	and then there's other people going i'm sick of that shit fuck the rust belt now we all we all
2672480	2678800	got confused and like how do we handle this what do we do still don't know but all i just know that
2678800	2685440	like this is death staring us in the face and like you know we may be two inches from our flipper
2685440	2692880	touching sand uh or there we may have just swam into the baltic on accident and and and this is
2692880	2696080	it but in either case you know don't yell at your girlfriend when you're going down
2696080	2700480	grab her grab her grab her butt and
2705600	2710720	and and and do as i do as i say not as i do because i have not i have yet to follow this rule i'm
2710720	2718400	fucking pissed and i hate and i and i'm afraid and you know this guy admires a fucking autocrat
2718400	2725200	that murders murders people just plain and simple murders first journalists like first and foremost
2725280	2732880	which like in our culture is supposed to be like the fucking like sin of all sins like not oh it's
2732880	2738240	it's like it's like it's like you know like when when the 1920s chicago stuff was happening
2738240	2743680	like the thing that ended it all in the public's eye as a journalist got shot you know like like
2743680	2748080	one of the gang gang families like they just they they didn't like how they got written about by
2748080	2753360	and there wasn't even journalism wasn't even like in its peak uh form back then um it was almost
2753440	2758000	worse than now but uh but but and it was but still it was like hey you don't do that you
2758000	2762560	don't fucking like shoot a guy that writes for a newspaper because you're having a disagreement
2762560	2767440	with your but now we're just like fuck it like the putin just fucking murders just look it up
2767440	2772400	look at the list of people that he's just murders his day job was the KGB those were the people
2772400	2777440	that pulled you out of your house and shot you in the head like that was his day job and trump
2777440	2784000	openly admires him on twitter for our uh fucking amusement and says like he's got it going on better
2784000	2791040	than abroad being president and and it's like we're gonna fucking die but it's like we can't
2791040	2799440	be shocked by it we gotta be like we're gonna fucking die it's just different from like the
2799440	2803760	richard lewis we're gonna die you know like like like we don't need richard lewis right now we need
2804480	2812320	uh we need richard lewis is a comedian back in the 80s very neurotic he uh he panicked a lot
2813440	2816720	but i'm not saying he's a bad person if he wants to come on the show and talk about
2818000	2822000	i love richard lewis i just mean as far as our spirit animals are concerned we need to go with
2822000	2829680	more of a uh more of a uh what's the comic that we should be going for i think uh mincia i don't
2829680	2837280	know yeah i don't i don't know stan hope we need to be more stan hopish we need to have stan hope
2840640	2845360	i hear i hear female voices grumbling i mean like like there's how about how about this there's no
2845360	2851920	there's there are no heroes like like like we're the the the word that let the other team think
2851920	2855440	that the idea is that you need a perfect quarterback and then your team can win all
2855440	2858960	this stuff i think the thing that they resent about us is that they think that we're like a
2858960	2864400	sexless raceless horde a board cube that's going to swallow them up let's just let them be right
2864400	2870400	about that and stop waiting for some like fucking superhuman tom cruzi but not offensively tom
2870400	2875360	cruzi guy to lead us all because it's you know it's it's like let's just be a committee like
2875360	2879600	which is what they've always feared what i've always resisted but let's just have common sense
2879600	2885120	and be like yeah it's hard to be a throng of people that tries to make sure that everybody
2885120	2890160	is relatively safe it looks a little bit like this it doesn't look as it doesn't look like bill
2890160	2895360	pulmon's speech in independence day that doesn't work in real life though like like if you want to
2895360	2901680	save the economy and the ecology and the equality you have to like actually just spread it out and
2901680	2908080	run things by relative commission uh what am i talking about all right so the uh the the the the
2908080	2917040	so they sang this song and uh and cody recorded it this is the ending of the song it's just
2917040	2921440	beautiful you know they say like we sing this song they have this whole preamble paint the picture
2921440	2925760	you're in somebody's home right now yeah it's like it's like just imagine like the like really like
2925760	2932000	the poorest like you we're sitting on the floor there's like and on the floor there's okay i'm
2932000	2937280	getting notes from levi levi was there too yeah yeah levi come out you want to come out and
2938320	2939200	steve levi
2944400	2951040	yeah i'm not gonna i'm not gonna go do uh altered states uh drugs without my assistant
2952880	2960400	i i i remember the the car ride there i i turned to cody and i whispered to her i was like i'm
2960400	2967600	so scared she's like don't be but i was like look at dan he dan dan was like this
2973360	2981200	see dan i always thought of you as a very intrepid adventurer and voyager uh yeah i mean i'll i'm a
2981200	2987520	real thrill seeker when it comes to what i eat and drink it was it was a pretty uh it was a pretty
2987520	2995280	incredible experience i i was terrified the whole waiting for them to come and then the exchange
2995280	3001040	and then getting in the car and driving into the middle of nowhere okay so that's so then so then
3001040	3004080	so then they go so we have a great time you're sitting on yeah they walked they walked us through
3004080	3008640	the village and it was there were no lights so there's no light pollution and it was you've
3008640	3012400	never seen stars like this in your entire life you literally haven't because we're in a different
3012400	3015680	part of the planet where you can't even see the big dipper it's a different constellation yeah
3015680	3018960	yeah you're seeing different stars which is awesome they call it the big dumper
3020400	3022560	they have a medium-sized dipper over there
3024800	3030400	we've been looking for it forever also they tore apart our cosmic kitchen they have one
3030400	3036560	constellation where's our medium dipper there's one constellation called orion's bracelets
3036800	3049520	where's where's where's where's where's orion's purse the good that i bought with that belt
3051120	3058320	the whole point of it uh so so so they they yeah it's like like a thatched like what do you
3058320	3062720	they have like a it's like a mat on the floor it was like a yeah it's like what i think they probably
3063600	3069520	a reed mat maybe yeah yeah and they uh there are a lot of bugs everywhere there's big cockroaches
3069520	3074000	lizards lizards crawling on the wall uh and then and there was a there was an american flag on the
3074000	3078320	wall we're like why is that there and they're like we heard you were coming we're actually
3080080	3084560	we're it was a joke though they we were we were the first americans that they'd had in there it's
3084560	3090400	usually australians that they uh they they entreat to this uh but uh so why is the what's
3090400	3094000	that american flag up there and they made the joke of like oh you're expecting it we're like no
3094000	3102080	come on that's and they're like no one of their his cousin was in the fijian navy uh which is just
3102080	3109600	it's it's uh those four kids who are laughing at me about the crab uh i i kid fiji's navy because
3110240	3117760	i'm safe uh the the but but no the it's in the fiji military i think the navy i assume and then
3118400	3125920	uh there was like a she met an american uh navy guy and uh he gave her an american flag and she
3125920	3130720	gave him a fiji flag and he's hanging her fiji flag at his apartment and they have it it was
3130720	3134320	very nice a lot of stuff like that where it was just like this is fucking beautiful and we drank
3134320	3140640	this like mud water that's like they're they present as if it's like they're like buckle up
3140640	3145440	and it's like all right the reason we went into the village was we want to see the village but
3145440	3149680	they said at the hotel it's like yeah the cover that we have here is just kind of like the
3149680	3154400	industrial like it it's i think you can buy this stuff in Greenwich village it's a relative of the
3154400	3158960	chili plant but it's like i think you might get your head cut off there for smoking weed so maybe
3158960	3162640	they're like lightweights i don't know but they they're like you it was like you'd think it was
3162640	3166960	ayahuasca the way they talked about it but and then you drink it and you're like tastes like dirt
3166960	3174160	and then you drink a bunch of cheap beer until you get drunk uh how many people are in this room uh
3174240	3180640	like yeah it was it was a good amount of people um did you count Marianne that way we got our
3180640	3183840	count wrong this is the most adorable little girl you've ever seen in your life Steve took
3183840	3188000	some great pictures where he had his big ass camera um all the kids are like walking around
3188000	3192960	with giant iphone giant relative to their bodies giant iphones and staring at the screens and like
3192960	3198560	like like like dogs running around uh all right so so then they go okay so before you go
3198560	3206400	uh uh we sing this song it's like and then it's an ancient tradition and uh like like like
3206400	3213840	in Fiji everyone you know there's no like fences are offensive oh i like that uh i take offense
3215520	3221680	the song was about um when when the men went off to war and the women and children
3222640	3229760	it was a song invented the alphabet it was a song essentially celebrating the men's life
3230320	3236320	and thanking them for for their going to war but also for giving them whatever you really
3236320	3242640	paid attention yeah well have you seen Atlanta yeah okay good i need you to brief me in the
3242640	3250480	car on the way home uh the the um uh so so yeah so we're gonna sing you this song and it's it's
3250560	3254720	you'll hear it and it's like it's it's gorgeous it sounds like a Paul Simon album and uh
3254720	3259360	they all harmonized like it was just like built in they just do some of them are just on instagram
3259360	3265200	and like kind of giggling like pre-kava during cover or post-kava this is post-kava we're like
3265200	3270880	ready to go home okay fritl was like falling asleep sitting up fritl's there too yeah okay
3270880	3275200	my friend from that we've met on the podcast my high school friend Dave Frito was there uh
3275760	3280800	Camille Cody Steve Levy and fritl um so then they sing the song and so then we'll move on from Fiji
3280800	3287840	but uh uh let's see and so you'll hear trains in the background and cars these guys are wearing like
3287840	3293600	soccer jerseys and Britney Spears concert shirts it's like it's it's not there's not like a pretense
3293600	3298640	in that culture of like we're one with nature it's just it's they live in paradise they live
3298640	3303760	in poverty they love that they get to go work at a resort instead of a sugar cane field but there's
3303840	3307600	like no and they're not like don't take pictures and don't do any of that it's just like it was
3307600	3310720	kind of a weird thing to wrap my brain around it wasn't like like you talk to other people
3310720	3315040	they go like oh we went to the Serengeti and then they made it i took out my phone and they said uh
3315040	3318480	uh and they made a phone out of a tree and then they're like this is our phone and kind of like
3319520	3323520	the sun came down and it's like you're not allowed to have aluminum there because there was it but
3323520	3327760	this isn't like that it was just like so you just hear these guys you'll hear like a freeway and a
3327760	3331600	train and stuff like that and they're like kind of harmonized but then then there's a part of the
3331600	3350000	song that i wanted you to hear that's the name of the hotel
3354400	3355520	i'm like did they just say
3361600	3367520	oh
3373360	3378800	so beautiful so beautiful couldn't help but notice an advertisement in there
3379760	3384560	for the hotel we're staying at uh and they said oh well that's that's the part of the
3384560	3390000	song where you talk about the the place where we met you know the place i don't know they
3390000	3394400	they explained it in a way that made me go oh once again i'm the asshole like i like like like
3394400	3401440	it's not integrated marketing it's just like it's it's it's it's them allowing the first world way
3401440	3406880	of things to to be incorporated into the how they've always done stuff did they give you like
3406880	3411920	a name like did they like give you like a special name for like like your they made me the chief
3411920	3417920	they said i was the chief well before we started doing kava you have to because we're the the new

3483040	3487680	off his iphones he's a teenager he's probably like like like hitting on somebody or like he's
3487680	3493440	caught up in his stuff um but uh the but and so they're like talking about like the tv shows that

3997840	4004320	and then when dan has selected his sentences then i give him an impression to do he has to
4004320	4009600	read those those sentences as that person and you don't try to make him impossible try to do
4009600	4014480	one that's possibly impressionable or impersonatable so when dan you're ready

4152560	4158960	really terrible i get that part that part is very clear for a time in west that sounds like christopher
4158960	4167760	walken um for a time in west germany and probably the most subsidized film industry in europe
4168400	4173920	if not the world but i gotta tell you it was never easy that way to meet films in germany
4175120	4183120	see bad that's good it's not about being good it's about getting it done can i can i play i have
4183120	4187760	to play a video because i specifically recorded it because i was watching mr ed with cody for uh
4188480	4193440	oh my god and i was like the pilot by the way the pilot of mr ed is the goddamn funniest pilot
4193440	4198800	and i was like and i was like holy shit i think mr ed is spencer kind of like like like uh like
4198800	4203760	i don't know if you'll be able to hear it he's okay

4274080	4280640	space program and they and there's a shot of him in a horse astronaut costume but that's not all
4280640	4287360	mr ed is mr ed's genius is in that it's actually the way when mr ed shines it's it's when it's
4287360	4291840	working around the fact that it's a sitcom about a talking horse to present you with just like kind
4291840	4296720	of funny it's like like you know it's just good some good comedy writing in that show like good
4296720	4301360	like little couplets and the pilot like they buy a new house uh wilbur and his wife is a name i
4301360	4305440	forgot and and they and yeah there's a horse here oh let's keep him honey i've always wanted a horse
4305440	4310800	and oh no we can't afford it no let's keep the horse and uh and he's like you can see wilbur in
4310800	4314640	the foreground and he's like brushing ed's like kind of rear end and like ed's in the background
4314640	4321440	he goes i've always wanted a horse it's been a long time since i had a horse been like i was
4321520	4324560	just a little boy and in the back of your it's been a long time since i was a pony
4325280	4329280	and but you don't see that happen and then wilbur just kind of like a near camera take
4330000	4337280	and he looks he's like no no no no no that can't be wait but it must have been somebody it sounds
4337280	4344800	like wait uh did you you didn't just talk no no no he was like like yeah like say something
4344800	4355280	like what anything yeah yeah but but right before that he goes like he goes like you didn't
4355280	4360080	just talk did you and then and then and then he didn't and then he goes back to his and then
4360080	4366640	and then mr ed goes like did you yeah yeah but he turns he goes say something like what anything
4366880	4375200	yeah yeah it's a it's a weird show because it like neither ignores it's like it's like
4375200	4380320	and it was on for 11 years uh there's only there's only there's only two seasons on uh
4380320	4385040	on an apple tv but uh they they maybe they maybe they took 10 years off between seasons and we're
4385040	4391120	like what the fuck are we doing i have i i own i own the full discology of that i have all the mr
4391200	4396720	eds they're really good there's absolutely never any explanation for why he talks in the in the
4396720	4401200	pilot five minutes in when he thought he'd said the first their first conversation ends with him
4401200	4409280	saying but but but but but how how is it possible i don't know don't question it wilbur it's bigger
4409280	4416880	than the both of us also the thing is he only talks to wilbur which makes him look like a
4416880	4421760	schizophrenic yeah and then he goes like why won't you talk to the message i don't know i never
4421760	4429040	trusted anybody else like yeah because he's nice to him yeah yeah but boy don't go there uh looking
4429040	4436400	to refill your feminism tank uh no that that's like that's a kept woman she's uh and she she's
4436400	4442320	got no qualms about it she's like like the the b stories are about her like trying to trick him
4442320	4446080	into buying her a tv and it's just it's just kind of like and she's just always like like like

4879200	4884640	and that's just a pope we don't call him young pope yeah but he was just a pope but that was like
4884640	4890320	in the 1500s i don't care i'm just talking like in terms of youngness of popes if you want to sell
4890320	4895200	it on the premise of a young pope you got to go younger than jude law that's like less old pope
4895200	4903840	well you know you do right or just pope yeah yeah younger than the last pope yeah
4905280	4910080	not not i don't know i'm sure it's great i'm sure he does a great job it's just it's not what you
4910080	4915920	expect i i wanted i really wanted to see someone with shades like really some skateboarding through
4915920	4924800	the vatican yes yeah like pope chad yeah pope chad the first pope attitude he's just the antichrist
4924800	4928960	right is that going to be the thing he's just the antichrist is that the jude law yeah because he
4928960	4932640	kind of seems from commercial like oh he's probably the antichrist maybe oh i don't know
4933600	4934640	maybe i'm dating myself
4936480	4942800	uh the uh here's the thing here's the thing i just realized this this is valuable uh play the
4942800	4948000	play the theme song for value corner value corner valuable information valuable insight not
4948000	4953120	information yeah valuable insight in me something i just realized that's really noteworthy
4953200	4957280	that uh i i i want to put into the record because i think it's fascinating
4965760	4969600	duck is the only animal i like to picture while i'm eating
4975680	4981840	i always do it like when i order when i'm eating ham i never picture a pig like like
4982000	4988560	i don't want to okay hamburgers i don't want to picture a cow uh a chicken no dice uh but every
4988560	4994320	time i see like oh duck duck uh duck prosciutto i'd love that and i always picture this mallard
4994320	5002640	flying while i'm eating it i'm like um like it's extra delicious when i think about his
5002640	5010400	feather covered breasts like nobly piercing the clouds like why why do you eat duck it's
5010880	5015920	well rarely but but then when i do i'm like i'm gonna eat a duck like no i'm not gonna eat duck
5015920	5023280	i'm gonna eat a duck like maybe i was like uh was i like uh was i like uh uh some kind of
5023280	5031280	very large swamp cat in a past life you might have been like a like a spaniel yeah yeah like
5031280	5035920	uh yeah so i don't feel that way about chicken or cows or anything i don't have like a herding
5035920	5040960	mentality but i really how about i really want to fetch a duck like give every goose yeah because
5040960	5044320	you know you're onto something because i don't like like the it's not like oh i can't wait to
5044320	5049120	devour the duck it's like i can't wait to sink my teeth into this flying mallard you know like
5049120	5055040	and maybe bring it to my owner maybe that's why like i like you might have been a labrador retriever
5055920	5063840	that's why i get along with harvey because he's uh part neither of those dogs he's a golden retriever
5063840	5068720	he's oh yeah oh labrador retriever is like half lab half golden or is a labrador retriever its own
5068720	5075760	kind of dog they're both retrievers because they retrieve labradors and and golden there's the
5075760	5081360	labrador retriever does not retrieve labradors yeah that would crash the simulation
5084000	5090320	there would be like a zero division by zero error honey honey why are there 11 labradors in our on
5090320	5098560	our doorstep well we have a labrador retriever why is the sky purple someone threw a labrador
5098560	5105120	and had a golden retriever get it oh wow yeah it's like it's like putting a portable hole in the back
5105120	5120640	of a holder yeah right mr ed that's no okay is that what he said uh the wefit girl
5121680	5127280	was the lungfish of a life spent on the shores of corporate uh assimilation uh
5129280	5131520	i was thinking about this today walk me through that one
5131520	5137840	some of you kids too too young even to remember this the wefit girl thing well too young to really
5137840	5142960	experience it was it was a scandal a little bit remember the wefit girl steve i know though yeah
5142960	5149520	okay so i don't pretend i don't know cody cody was on my elliptical today and it's like her
5149520	5154240	isn't she a character in smash yeah well that's the thing if there's a scandal that's weird
5154240	5162560	well it wasn't okay look the wefit video that was it was it was the girl at the ponytail and
5162560	5166800	she's in her in her underwear and in a t-shirt she's doing the hula hoop game on the wefit and
5166800	5170160	then there's like a guy filming it and then the camera turns to him and he's like and then it
5170160	5176960	goes back and then it went viral because it was like wow that's she's she's so uh unintentionally
5176960	5181840	like globally catching our attention with her innocent use of this uh consumer product that
5181840	5185920	happened to launch last week the the the and then there was like a little mini scandal where it was
5185920	5191600	like they were on the nintendo payroll or something right i mean i don't know about that um well maybe
5191600	5195760	that even goes more to my point because whatever they whatever was wrong whatever was scandalous
5195760	5199280	about it i remember there was like just some thing where it was just like oh did you know that they
5199280	5203360	got paid to do that or something like that like i was explaining that to cody today because she
5203360	5207440	didn't know what the hell i was talking about and i was like and then i stopped halfway through
5207440	5211440	because she was like that doesn't even seem like why would that even be a wrong thing who cares
5211440	5217200	if nintendo gave you a bunch of money and then you successfully staged an innocent objectification
5217200	5221440	video of your supposed girlfriends or the thing and i was like yeah you're right that would be
5221440	5226560	absolutely high fived now as just a piece of media that was successful in a time when it's hard to
5226560	5232640	affect people like like and like i just thought that was noteworthy that we were still so innocent
5232640	5237040	like eight years ago that we i remember people being like yeah but you hear that's fake that's
5237040	5246000	fake anyways all right fuck you guys that wasn't the same segment you you just you put
5246000	5252080	parentheses around that wasn't part of the duck thing i don't i don't want that dragging the duck
5252080	5258320	thing down that was rnd that was like that was like workshopping like that's not even
5258400	5262400	gonna air on the west coast you mayor you mayor all all comptroller
5265440	5270320	he's got a point fair enough uh okay so uh
5278160	5285360	it's the best music of all time they speak three languages in fijian by default and the english
5285360	5289440	fijian and fijian has like 19 dialects but also they have to speak like um i can't even remember
5289440	5292560	should have written a town but french maybe no no it's not french pollination what is it
5293520	5298560	is it french french that's probably yeah i'm sure it's french the the but here's the crazy
5298560	5305680	thing that the kids when they go to school uh english is compulsory fijian isn't yeah i
5305680	5310880	don't think it's french that's not french pollination fiji is it no people are saying german
5310880	5316240	in the front row that doesn't seem well steve do you know maybe uh one of the indian
5318000	5322960	oh hindi it's probably it's probably hindi they probably have to speak hindi yeah there's
5322960	5327520	a there was a there's a huge indian population there but they're descended from like like five
5327520	5335280	generations ago uh they brought i don't know who like i have giant gaps in my not a provider of
5335280	5340000	this information but it's like indian people were brought there or came there to do the work the
5340000	5346240	sugar cane fields and then there it might could it have been slavery i don't know because part of
5346240	5351280	the story is that then they could go back and then they like a lot of them maybe it was a really bad
5351280	5355200	time in india there was just like a refugee thing and then a lot of them could go back and then
5355200	5359280	but then there's just descendants there of people who are like are you fucking kidding me like i'm
5359280	5364400	not leaving fiji and and so there's like uh and they have like this really like positive attitude
5364400	5368800	about multiculturalism there they they have a they're they're they have this like military regime
5368880	5372160	that i don't know anything about because they don't want to throw shade on it because they're
5372160	5377920	so nice but they have this like tribe of they have these provinces and then each province is
5377920	5384000	headed up by an elder and then because it's just old school stuff and they don't have any like power
5384000	5390080	in the sense that you know there's no contract but if you were to defy them you know they're like
5390800	5400720	they're like the graybeards in skyrim all right you didn't talk but they they they you didn't
5400720	5405120	mention how like when we got in the car the first one of the first things the guy said when we got
5405120	5410000	there was he was talking about disrespecting local fijian yeah he told a story about a missionary
5410000	5414480	that got eaten there because he rubbed their head or something that's just that's that's just
5414560	5421040	you know what is that i rubbed his head uh do you know about he didn't eat me i don't know if
5421040	5427520	it's how much of south pacific islands the thing is uh when i was in tahiti the third sun thing
5427520	5432480	you know about that yeah but wait hold on because that's rich and uh but but uh rich is the third
5432480	5438480	sun uh yeah that's that's you know rich that's worth talking about i want to i want i want you
5438480	5440960	to talk about that because you're telling us about that in australia i thought that was really
5440960	5446720	fascinating but but the the elders um that when the refugee crisis happened or it was actually a
5446720	5451280	previous refugee crisis right like like not the current syrian one but it was like something
5451280	5457040	similar there's a bunch of people that needed homes and the elders like gave a bunch of fijian
5457040	5462400	land to any refugees that wanted to come to fiji who doesn't want to go to fucking fiji but it's
5462400	5466960	like it's it's only on the condition that they can't sell the land they don't like they it's
5466960	5471600	theirs to live on and do as they please and reproduce on and work until until the day they
5471600	5477200	die and their children or whatever but it's just like they can't like sell it so and it's and
5477200	5482720	they're they're fucking ecstatic they're like they have like a thriving uh section of people
5482720	5487360	there that were that were descended from refugees i don't know it was it was i think it was afghanistan
5487360	5492960	and it was it was the middle east like bad things don't automatically happen to you just because
5493040	5498480	you're like hey if you want to use my pool you know it's like nobody's gonna like go who you
5498480	5503600	said i could use it and take a shit you know like it's the worst part of you that assumes that about
5503600	5508000	them okay so yeah talk about your tahitian no i mean i'm i i will get this wrong is anybody
5508000	5512960	know more about this than i do there's a thing called like i forget the word for it in like
5512960	5518720	samoan or tahitian but like i will get all this wrong so please like send your letters to steve
5519280	5523120	at stevelevy.hotmailballworship.com
5527840	5533200	there's like there are a bunch of like guys on on the island there that are just as big as every
5533200	5538240	other guy and they're raised as women i believe and i think it's a third son thing if you're if
5538240	5542720	you're the third son you are raised as a woman and it's like a place of honor i know i'm fucking
5542720	5547200	this up i think it's different throughout the islands there's a huge like the transsexual
5547200	5553440	and like transvestite like culture like it's it's they're regarded as not divine but special
5553440	5557440	it's like that i believe there's a part of it where if you're the third son you're just raised
5557440	5562320	to be the woman another woman in the house and they're treated with huge respect like so like
5562320	5568000	there just be this giant you know pacific islander guy walking by you but it's it's she she is a or
5568000	5573200	he or she i don't know how it works but they're just they have makeup on and they they dance the
5573200	5580080	woman parts and they they do they do the the female like work in the household and then so
5580800	5584560	i know i'm fucking all this up i have not done any research on it but that's the bits and pieces that
5584560	5589360	i thought i picked up we went across the island from the resort to where the locals hung out on
5589360	5596800	sunday which is their day off and it was all of them like so this woman like or man or whatever
5596800	5603440	tupu or topu just you know like my height or taller who was the bartender and she was hilarious
5603440	5606960	like she's like oh you want to dance with me like she would come over like it's like terrifying
5606960	5612880	because she's like like i could fit inside her like a costume like she's just like and but they're
5612880	5617040	they're all just all hanging out and there's no like there's no separation between like trans
5617040	5622400	culture or straight or gay that they're all just one one group it seemed like there was like a
5622480	5628000	liberal amount of like i would you know like i think that waiter's gay i think that person's
5628000	5634880	gay we did have conversations about like like like like oh was that person trans maybe and and like
5634880	5638160	what did they think about that here because you you don't really want to like we didn't want to like
5639280	5643120	be guests from the first world that were like in these people's living room and like
5643120	5648080	you know put you know like it wasn't like let's let's turn over every corner and every stone like
5648160	5653120	talk a little bit about politics but never never heard anything that indicated like
5653120	5658160	homophobia or transphobia or anything like that and i wouldn't be shocked if equatorial and island
5658160	5662400	cultures like were a little more comfortable with that for a long time coming because
5663040	5668080	the well then i'd say a bunch of shit that would make me some weird Archie bunker like like
5668080	5673680	anthro splaining to some shit that would get me in in hot water but i but i but i suffice it to say
5673680	5678320	i would just assume that's like like like you know the more nomadic like we gotta kill a mammoth
5678320	5682960	or we're gonna die and like oh these people invented math so now let's just move in thanks
5682960	5688720	for the math like that's that's those people had male gods according to like what i learned from
5688720	5694720	from campbell and the equatorial civilizations had had female gods and they were like like oh you
5694720	5700080	know god's a woman and a moon and a and a tide and and and here's math and here's algebra and
5700080	5703520	here's all this shit and then the dudes come down with it and they go like we know how to make
5703520	5709120	spears sharp click click and then but not that they weren't like brutal in those agricultural
5709120	5713040	cultures but because you live by your plants and you're the growing out of the ground and then you
5713040	5718880	eat them like you're probably there's probably a little less incentive incentive for going back
5718880	5724800	50 000 years for like oh that guy throws like a girl you know like like fuck him like like like
5724800	5728800	there's something wrong with him like there's probably a little more capacity for for like
5728800	5734080	oh like who cares like maybe you're good at math or what i don't fucking know it's just sue me
5734080	5738640	tomorrow you know i i just i i just said a little fast skimming like but you also told me no they
5738640	5742000	hate it they'll cut off your head if you pretend you know i'd be like i'm not surprised because
5742000	5749120	i'm so smart i'm just fucking idiot i fucking hate myself i'm gonna kill myself right now no no
5752480	5755440	boys and girls if you clap loud enough he'll kill himself
5759040	5764800	we have two we have two we have we have official two two two two order two two pieces of business
5764800	5768160	real quick let me interrupt you i just doing a bit a bit of skimming i might have misunderstood
5768160	5772000	a lot of that there's also a thing in Samoa called third gender and like there's like there's a whole
5772000	5774400	what no no no
5779200	5780160	not in my town
5782400	5786720	so i i want to do more research on that i think i i think i missed a lot of the information than
5787520	5791200	human beings are a motorcycle the front wheel is a dick and balls
5791760	5798880	and the back wheel is a pussy you add a third wheel and the it doesn't tip over but it's more
5798880	5803680	stable it's okay yes it's more stable you can't if you're in a chase you can't go through a tunnel
5806960	5811440	i don't want to hear it i don't want to hear it no you'll make me go to the bathroom in my
5811440	5813840	blue black bathroom i don't know white bathroom there

5923520	5926400	i don't think i just i just don't see the nightmare
5929520	5933600	i try to get inside the head of the enemy you know so i can try to like you know and it's just
5933600	5938480	like i don't it's just it it ends at like this gate where it's like they don't they don't think
5938480	5943200	past that gate they're just like well it's they're sleeping with our women which is i mean it's a
5943200	5949200	disgusting thought but that's where it comes from and then they're probably sexually frustrated
5949280	5954160	people who are like this is me that's not getting slept with and you know they can't admit that
5954160	5960720	obviously so just fuels this crazy anger yeah i mean i'm my pornography is all a bunch of white
5960720	5965680	women like i i so i guess like like there's something deep-seated like you know i want to
5965680	5971440	like fuck a white woman and so i guess if you're living somewhere and i guess if you ask a girl
5971440	5975360	out and she's like no and then she sleeps with a guy that's darker than you i guess you're like
5975360	5981280	that's it that tears it but yeah but but but but but wouldn't you just have that story and then
5981280	5986000	just be like they're bad people too i mean oh that's right they're bad people i forgot yeah

6068400	6072000	like oh that's bigger oh i would have and i you thought when i didn't drink out of this you
6072000	6076960	thought like maybe i was like sending a signal i was like i was like fuck your fuck your glass
6076960	6082720	use it man use it that's your crowdfunded glass yeah was that there wasn't a controversy about
6082720	6089520	the crowdfunding oh yeah there was so yeah we we uh after the first one was was was gone we assumed
6089520	6096560	stolen based on the word from backstage um there's a lot of outcry on online and we knew that you were
6096560	6102160	disappointed we knew that that people really enjoyed seeing the special rocks glass that we'd
6102160	6107840	made um so we and for the listeners not watching the uh the video they're kind of a beautiful
6108400	6112560	play off of a red solo cup yeah so they're based on on the design of a solo cup so i came up with
6112560	6117600	the design for it and then i worked with a uh a glass maker so i work it i work in corning
6117600	6121520	and i worked with a master glass blower and this is conflict glass isn't it
6121520	6131200	this is this is it's made out of sand that uh from olepo yes that's like
6133440	6136480	there's a special when a when a mortar round hits sand
6137440	6142720	it creates a special glass that's it just has a little less aftertaste there's there's actually
6142720	6147520	some trinitite mixed in there too there's some the molten sand from white sands is there from
6147520	6153360	the first nuclear explosion no no no i'm kidding sorry sorry i've got bits i've got bits you got
6153360	6158720	bits that's good no um i know you were interested in glass in glass blowing uh yeah so so we did a
6158720	6163840	we did an indiegogo we raised the money to pay the glass blower to recreate his work
6163840	6168160	and in the process he made the double rocks glass for you to make up for yours um you've already
6168160	6174800	got one so we didn't make one for you but i'm i'm i'm set can we do a reverse indiegogo where i can
6174800	6183280	just pay everybody back well uh so we actually have we'll have a full set of four now oh cute
6183280	6188800	with the with us slot for dan and jeff and for the also for the listener he it's in what looks
6188800	6195680	like a weapons-grade gun case yeah custom foam so this is actually a request from chris and sarah
6195680	6199760	backstage to have something in a pelican case that they can then store with the equipment yeah
6199920	6207120	it's a nick urie uh beverage where how did you make those custom foam inserts i want to know
6208080	6213280	because i've often looked into getting some custom foam inserts made oh that's right i
6213280	6217920	forgot about the sponsor um the market is custom foam inserts
6220800	6227600	some from the inserts so many so many nights like two three am i'll get a text from spencer
6227600	6230240	just haranguing me about foam inserts right
6232640	6238400	uh it's near and dear to my heart in all honesty we can take this offline i can give you okay have
6238400	6243440	you guys seen this commercial for i i i don't have to watch commercials but we were in new york and
6243440	6248560	so i saw a lot of this catheter cowboy and then i i think i instagram but uh and then there was
6248560	6255120	this guy like um the my pillow guy have you guys know that is that is that air here he's so proud
6255120	6261120	of his pillow it's so funny because his product is called my pillow like in his mind it's a brand
6261120	6267600	name but it's just the words my pillow so all he is is a nine foot mustachioed like kind of
6267600	6273280	firefighter physique guy clutching a pillow to his chest just saying my pillow is the best pillow
6273280	6279760	you'll ever have and he just he's just talking about my pillow and how great it is and it's
6279760	6285280	adorable you're gonna love my pillow if you can get it i designed my pillow so that my head can
6286480	6291760	i dare you to take my pillow normal pillows make you lose sleep my pillow doesn't i wake
6291760	6300080	up in the morning refreshed all the time call my pillow if you want my pillow uh anyways so
6300080	6306480	jane how's it going jane the person it give us some updates not jane the glassware uh provider
6306480	6311760	right the second part so i've actually uh we've been fucked over on and off over the last three
6311760	6319200	years really um i've actually reached a point where i have given notice at work that uh that
6319200	6326880	i'd like by name officially on the record to begin to be dr jane cook oh and so i'm hoping
6326880	6331600	that'll come to pass in the next couple of months at work so that'll be officially out there
6332320	6338480	i kind of like that that's the last step like i it says something about you as a person that
6338480	6344240	i like i like the last step being the professional world because it's like well it need to be i built
6344240	6350640	up a reputation over like 20 years as a scientist and my name was out there on on papers and patents
6350640	6355200	and whatnot uh so there was sort of and there was also a respect for the institution i mean i work
6355200	6363680	at a museum and which is a it's a public educational institution and it it my transitioning
6363680	6369840	my gender is is sort of my thing how i present it i i don't want the story of that institution to
6369840	6374800	be me right the story of the institution is glass it's science it's it's art it's history
6376000	6380240	it had to get to a point where i was feeling comfortable comfortable enough with my presentation
6380240	6385440	comfortable enough with my safety net that i was willing to then step take that next step
6385440	6392640	in a way that wouldn't impact the broader world that i was part of but one thing that's that is
6392640	6397680	important to me two two aspects of this is i'm not doing like a legal name change and i'm not doing a
6397680	6404960	legal gender change because fuck it i i don't need the government's permission to say what i am
6404960	6410720	i don't need the government's permission to say what my name is now when you've got a lot of people
6410720	6415760	who care about me who who like me to be me when you fill out government like documents and it says
6415760	6420560	there's m or f did you just stick with what was already given just for just for simplicity's sake
6421280	6425920	well it i sort of think about what's what's the intent of the demographic information
6425920	6429200	so if i'm going to be flying there's still the whole thing where if i'm going to be reading
6429200	6432800	mail it's probably better to put the m down but if i know they're just collecting information
6432800	6437520	about what's the gender of the people who were buying this couch i'll put female oh good yeah
6437520	6441760	yeah because i'm a i'm a female person on the couch but i'm a male male person still when i
6441760	6446320	go through i think you know like if you got the couch because it had cup holders you're like you'll
6446320	6452080	put male exactly but if you if you got it because i like the fabric
6455040	6458960	you're talking to a trans person you can be totally you can just do all the old 80s uh
6458960	6465280	gender jokes exactly great absolutely his his toilet seat never mind yeah i don't know about
6465280	6469520	toilets he took me down that's the directions directions but i want the toilet paper going
6469520	6477280	around the top that's um somebody went whoo i know how to push this button yeah it's good
6477920	6483680	but yeah so yeah so that's good and what so you gave notice but do you have any feedback from
6483680	6488240	that as a like like oh i'm really lucky to work at a really great place that it was uh
6488240	6491840	congratulations yeah we're behind you this is this is great we're so happy that you had that
6491840	6495600	feeling about them they're people of science you worked in this you know these people forever and
6495600	6499600	you know that they respected you and they and that's uh i think that's important to stress
6499600	6506400	like that's a real that's very menschy of you is that the real the reason you the reason you uh
6506400	6516720	menschy but not none by nenschy uh the the the that you you episode title you you exercised
6516720	6523040	restraint not out of shame and not out of uh profiteering or any like like self-preservation
6523040	6529200	but out of actual deference to the the the the environment like like like like you said i i'm
6529200	6534000	just i think that's cool and neat like like very heroic like like there's there's like
6534960	6538320	there's there's there's different cultures out there we're all warring with each other there's
6538320	6541680	people that are militant about the fact that i don't want to i don't want to throw them under
6541680	6544960	the bus that they're like if someone's gay and they're out there i'm gonna out them you know
6544960	6548240	that whole thing that we were going through in the 90s when it was like they you're out you're
6548240	6552160	out we're outing you and then other people going well wait that's how is that helping if the person
6552160	6556960	wants to be in the closet is very confusing issues and stuff so i find that fascinating that
6556960	6563680	you have to you have to just sit on a couch with cup holders and uh think about that a lot like
6563680	6570240	you have to nobody else has to most other people don't have to think that much about that shit
6570240	6575760	which is actually part and parcel of on the reverse side isn't that part of the the problem
6575760	6580560	when we run into bigotry and stuff it's like people going what i gotta think about this now
6580560	6584880	and it's like an un unplowed sidewalk in front of their house that you didn't tell them they had
6584880	6589200	and they're like oh resent that like i don't have work to do i think there's i think there's a deeper
6589200	6595840	psychological uh and personality thing that goes into this that i think just about anybody can come
6595840	6601680	up with some some binary that they're a part of some system that they're imposed that's imposed
6601680	6606240	on them but the real issue is what you is buried in what you're saying is this idea of being
6606240	6612320	self-examining and being either just by your personal nature you you need to be able to think
6612320	6617760	about how you think you need to think about how you fit in and if you if you if you have unfortunately
6617760	6621440	if you have the privilege or if you're higher up maslow's pyramid that you actually have the
6621440	6627600	resources and the privilege and the opportunity to really dig into yourself without sacrificing
6627600	6631520	the fact that you don't have you know i've got a place to live i've got food i've got clothes i've
6631520	6639520	got family i've got friends okay good i can think about whether or not my gender identity matches
6639520	6645280	my equipment that's not that's a privilege and then to be able to actually act on it that's
6645280	6649280	another privilege and to be able to act on it with a certain amount of safety that's another
6649280	6654960	privilege and a lot of people don't get to that point but i think everybody i i believe in my
6654960	6663280	heart everybody nobody fits in to anything the the game is to figure out that's why when they hear
6663280	6672240	the word privilege they the the alarms go up because because the it they think that it precedes
6672800	6678640	their fire truck being taken away you're privileged you have too much already and they
6678640	6684480	they feel like judge reinhold in fast times when the guidance counselor says sorry but the party's
6684480	6691360	over he's like i'm waiting for it to start um that that's what privileged people feel when they
6691360	6695360	hear the word privilege is they're like wait privilege i just finished arguing with a lady
6695360	6701120	at the bank that the that's my money and you're telling me stuff about and and so it's not to
6701120	6706400	validate uh anger and hatred but just to say that's that's what's happening like we all got
6706400	6711920	a lot of shit to deal with and the word privilege is being perceived too much as like someone wants
6711920	6716000	your pants you have too much pants no one wants your pants you don't have to give anybody your
6716000	6720240	pants like like like it's just never going to happen no one's going to come in and take your
6720240	6725600	pants and and i think and and that is what we get down to like oh i'm proud of my race and i'm
6725600	6730240	proud of my gender because it's like we it's there's almost an uplifting silver lining there
6730240	6736000	where it's like well we used to be worried about who's going to take our property who's going to
6736000	6742080	you know we're at a first world empire so we could be within reach of actual like kind of like
6742080	6748480	evolution if we if if the timeline goes one way instead of the other because we've really gotten
6748480	6752800	down to shit that you are so fundamental to human nature yeah we've got to this point where
6752800	6758480	we're actually recognizing what's our fear point right what what what really motivates us because
6758480	6763600	you can always like megan kelly talking almost like like you know like like the fox news thing
6763600	6768400	it's like that's always like the that's what draws those viewers it's that thing of like
6768400	6776480	up next a law that says santa has to be mexican and and they and they like feed into this like
6776480	6783120	this this fear folks in acapulco say yes and that's and there's always this unspoken story
6783120	6786560	of what's next what's next what's next what are they going to do next what are they going to take
6786560	6791040	away next and it's like nothing's ever been taken from you and nothing's ever been given to you
6791040	6796880	either like you don't even have that much if you're proud of santa claus's color like you might be
6797440	6805440	fucking disenfranchised too like like you you might you might be a fucking redneck you might
6805440	6812880	you might be you you might have been handed a pack of saltine crackers by your mama and told
6812880	6817280	that that's a six course meal you know and and that and that and that no one's ever going to take
6817280	6823200	these saltines away from you baby and it's like it's like there's a bit like like when people get
6823280	6828800	upset when they go like santa claus there's a biracial santa claus at the mall what's go
6828800	6837040	how could that happen 50 years ago santa was white all the time now he's biracial i can't take it it
6837040	6847920	happens so fast the good news with that is that if if santa claus's color can change that quickly
6847920	6857680	that means you're a week from being smart like you can change faster you're not a fucking logo
6857680	6862640	you're not a children's book you're not a classic television show you're not a comic book like
6862640	6868880	you're you're a fucking human being and there is you could have a new tradition that wouldn't be
6868880	6874720	easily defileable because it wouldn't be based on race like it would be having corporate we've done
6874720	6880880	that with everything else no one got mad well actually people did when someone invented the
6880880	6887360	heater and someone was probably like heaters that little tiny atoms making me hot instead of open
6887360	6900000	flame what's next my baby living longer like progress fucks with shit that was happening
6900000	6906320	yesterday all in every fucking fundamental way the the fact what i can't eat meat now
6906960	6912960	wow is it meat like but but was it like what was this was this meat country was this white country
6912960	6918800	was this it wasn't either it's just your your your culture was a collection of fucking references
6918800	6926000	like it was like oh green lanterns white uh stephen king's a writer uh uh uh everyone should have two
6926000	6931760	dogs uh fireplaces are square uh it's just random shit like that shit changing isn't good
6931760	6937040	what am i talking about what did i thank you for coming to harmontown everybody that's been a show
