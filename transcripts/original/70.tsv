0	25240	Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, once again, to Hollywood, California, Meltdown Theater,
25240	35480	Meltdown Comics, that is, once again, Harman Town is in session, once you do me, do me
35480	41840	and do yourselves a kindness and welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman!
41840	56520	Thank you. We have so much to do. We just gotta go. We don't often have a lot to do.
56520	64800	I saw your eyes dart to my new affectation. This will be 20 minutes of the show.
64800	74680	Dan, for the home listener, has taken to over the last couple days wearing an invention of,
74680	81040	I believe, Spencer's design, correct? I went to Spencer, and I said, Spencer, I need to keep
81040	89840	track of things very quickly. Like, how quickly, beyond Steve Job's definition, I call him Job's.
89840	97480	I think of him as a biblical character. Beyond Steve Job's definition of, like, visionary,
97480	103120	though, he was, like, how quickly can Dan Harman's brain be stored permanently? So,
103120	109760	I'm wearing a notepad around my neck with a pen on the string. Is it a shoelace or a lanyard string?
109760	115320	It's a sort of black cordage. The brilliant thing about this is that it has three components,
115320	122000	all of which can be replaced. I've already forgotten many of them on my bedstand. Spencer
122000	127080	is then able to create a new one. But for the home listener, you have a black string around
127080	134440	your neck. It's a black string around my neck. It's kind of a 3x5 or 4x6 looking spiral notepad,
134440	141600	and a pen dangling. A pen with the pocket clip of the pen anchored on the string. So,
141600	153800	let me show you. So, you, sir, what's your name? Greg. Yeah, here's the thing. It'll take forever
153800	161280	to put the pen back, but Greg, boom, fucking, your mouth to my notepad. Like, that's not,
161280	165200	that, like, now, okay, now let's pretend I don't have the notepad around my neck. What's your name?
165200	174240	Greg. Now Dan's taking out his enormous phone. You gotta open up an app. Get away from 4chan and
174240	180480	onto the notepad document. Fuck it. You know, at a certain point, it's like, fuck, who's Greg?
180480	190520	Who cares? Humanity. The eye-harmin around my neck. Spencer Crittenden created this. Eye-harmin
190520	195640	with my idea. I coined the phrase eye-harmin. Eye-harmin. I also named it the eye-harmin. I
195640	202440	call it the eye-harmin. Also, chest notes. Chest notes. This is a big deal. Here's the other thing.
202440	209920	What about, what about memo around him? Memo around him. Memo around him. Memo around him,
209920	215040	so it could be unisex. Memo around him? No. I want to explain something super cool about this,
215040	222240	is that Spencer and I talked about this, and he said, yeah, but it won't be, like, if the string
222240	228040	goes through the top, then you won't be able to, and I said, look, here's the thing. I am prepared
228040	238840	to change my way of thinking about what constitutes the bottom and top of a notepad. That's the genius.
238840	249360	That's me being Steve Jobs. That's the whole point is, ska-ba! All you have to do is think
249360	261040	different. This is the top now. It's fucking amazing. And also, if you choose to, if my name
261040	268440	happened to be on the cover, you'd know my name. This is like my Malcolm X bow tie.
269240	274520	Just in case we're going on a movement here. Don't adopt it right away. Let me refine this. Let me
274520	280840	workshop this, because I think the size can be adjusted. Don't do anything yet. I put forward
280840	284040	to Dan earlier that he should get a bigger notepad, and on the front of it, just draw a big clock,
284040	288800	and he'll, like, flavor-flave. Let me workshop it, and then we'll be okay. What about this size?
288800	292680	This is what I was talking to you earlier. Was that more suitable? That's what I had in mind. Spencer
292680	299880	doesn't, you know, he's a strange child. I think he went and cut a real notebook into different
299880	305400	shapes. I don't know. Wait, wait. Does that hewn out of a larger thing? Yeah, he does weird shit.
305400	312400	If you go into Spencer's, like, if you get a ride from Spencer, he'll have a, like, Spencer has,
312400	320040	like, he's like a myth buster. Like, he has, like, he'll have, like, a thing in his car that's, like,
320040	326600	made out of binder clips that'll hold his iPhone, but it's, like, you know, he's like a life hacker.
326600	334280	He's a life hacker. Okay. Yeah, don't worry about it. Have you got any chest nuts on your chest notes?
334280	339160	Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I do. My breathing issue, I want to talk about that. I've been
339160	343240	I've been listening to Harmontown episodes, and I've noticed that my thing is that I do this.
344200	347480	Hey, Jeff, giraffes are weird, right? Why do they have such long necks?
351640	353560	I have this nerd inhale that I get.
355480	357720	Is that you guys know what I mean, right? Like,
359160	363160	I've never noticed. I'd like to change it. I don't want to do it anymore. You make a face like
363160	367640	you're breathing through your nose, but you're going through your mouth. I'm imitating the sound.
367640	371480	I don't know when I'm doing it, but like, it's a weird thing to have to listen to,
371480	375080	and I don't want to do it anymore. Okay. All right. That's a self adjustment.
375640	378040	I'd like to talk tonight about how to take a compliment.
379640	383000	Okay. A lot of us don't know how to do that. Say what, Adam?
383000	388200	That's a good topic. Yes, thank you, Adam. See, you just did it. Oh, yes, great.
391800	396680	Next item on the agenda. That was so much easier than we all expected.
397720	400760	All right, Jeff, tell me I did a tell me I did a good job at something.
400760	403880	Dan, that is a lovely notepad hanging around your midsection.
403880	406440	Well, it's a work in progress. I don't know what I'm doing.
406440	408840	See what I did there? I told him he was a piece of shit.
410120	413960	I told him he doesn't know what he's talking about. We all have that on us. We want to be
413960	418760	humble, and it's for a good reason. Is there any concern of when you're wearing it? I hate to go
418760	423320	back to the chest notes or eye harmony, but is there any concern as you wearing a big notepad
423320	427320	or around your chest that people will mistake you for, like, a deaf person?
428120	434520	Yeah, I'm 40 years old. I'm charging into the fucking preach.
435160	440040	It makes you look a little special. And an argument can be made that I am.
440040	442760	See, you just took another compliment. I snuck one in there and you took it.
442760	444360	Thank you. You're welcome.
444360	444840	Thank you.
444840	445880	That was a great compliment.
447080	447800	You ain't shitting.
448840	451240	See what we're doing there? That's how work gets done.
453800	456040	Are you, have you always been bad at taking compliments?
456040	458040	Yeah. You seem like you can take a compliment.
458040	462280	I've learned, I had therapists that told me, they said, when you do that,
463320	469400	you tell people that they're full of shit. And somebody says, I liked what you did. I
469400	473320	like what you do. I like your jacket. I like your hair. You look like you lost weight.
474040	477880	Something like that. You tell them, you automatically go, no, I haven't. I don't
477880	480600	know what you're just saying to them. You don't know what you're talking about.
480600	485080	Your eyeballs are idiots. You're an idiot. And your brain is dumb. You don't know what
485080	493400	you're talking about. But it's a big, it's a fucking thing. It's the crux. It's the knot.
493960	498680	It's the knot of civilization, Jeff. We've all, like, we need to figure this out.
499240	501160	I'd like to try to figure it out. What are you writing down?
502920	504120	I make notes all the time.
504120	505720	Okay. All right. Good job.
506280	508040	What's that guy's name? What's that guy's name on the front row?
508040	508520	Greg.
508520	508840	All right.
508840	509320	Okay.
509880	515400	Yeah. Just even the writing it down, wrote it down in my brain.
515400	518760	Yeah, it is a thing though. When someone pays you a compliment, even if you disagree with them,
518760	521720	even if you think like someone goes, oh, you look nice today and you feel like you look like shit
521720	525080	or you've had a bad day. When somebody says something nice, even if you think that they're
525080	529160	wrong, you still say thank you. You don't have to go, you know what? You're really right.
529160	530360	You're really, I really am.
530360	534040	Yeah. They're never going to look like, no one's ever going to come up to you and go,
534040	538600	I love your hair. And then you go, thank you. They're never going to walk away and go,
538600	544600	he said, thank you. What a dick. Unless they're a huge dick and they're setting you up.
544600	547240	But once you start getting good at taking compliments, cause like, you know,
547240	551240	like we all do, like what my friend kind of coined as like this old thing. So I'm going to go,
551240	554280	you look great today. Oh, this is a, oh, I got this off the rack. This is a thrift store,
554280	559080	five dollars. And you say like, oh, this whole thing, like you're stupid. You're wrong.
559080	562280	If you just say thank you, that's great. But then once you get good at that,
562280	566120	then people pay you sarcastic compliments. He goes, nice suit, bro. You go, thank you.
566520	572680	And here's what I'd like to talk about. This is the weird thing. Fishing for compliments.
573720	579880	This is where people like me get thrown for a loop. Many times people come up to you and,
579880	587240	and self-deprecate as an entree to a conversation. People come up to you and they say,
589320	596040	my shirt's so stupid. I shut down at that point. I know. And I, I watch everyone around me get
596360	605640	your shirt's amazing. And I watched society rise around me because I shut down. I go, I go, let's,
605640	609640	I don't, I never had an opinion about your shirt, but I do know that you're trying to
609640	614760	get me to say something about your shirt and I can't do it. And I won't do it because,
614760	620760	because in my world, if I tell you your shirt is noteworthy, it's fucking noteworthy. Like
620760	628760	that's, that's my Bitcoin. Like I create my, like my, my currency. Dan Harmon said,
628760	637400	have a nice day to me. I should have a nice day. Dan Harmon told me to, he didn't just barf it out.
637400	643480	Now you're paying yourself compliments. No, I'm not. I'm being, thank yourself. Thank yourself.
643480	648280	Like, I don't know. I'm bad at making a show. I don't know. I shouldn't, I shouldn't be talking
648280	652920	to a microphone at all. Like I should just stop. I should just stop. I should just stop talking to
652920	655960	this microphone. I don't know. I don't even know what I'm doing. Good night everybody. Thanks for
655960	662440	coming. That's our show. That was our quickest show. Every day we feel that, right? That's that,
662440	667000	that's the thing. Like, like people, people puncture like their little mosquito proboscis
667000	671960	into you and it's got a little hook on the other end of it. They want something from you. I can't,
672760	679960	like people, people do it all the time and I think, I think good people just, just like they respond
679960	685320	to it appropriately. Like people go, I didn't know what I did with my hair. And then someone goes like,
685320	689320	no, it looks great. It looks great. And then they make friends and I don't know how to do that.
689320	695240	That's where I shut down to give you a script. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm
695240	700040	talking to you. I'm not worthy of talking to you. And I'm, I'm supposed to say you're worthy of
700040	704760	talking to me. I don't know you. I don't know that you're worthy of talking to me. You can't
704760	710520	just, you can't just create an effect by saying the opposite thing. Fuck you. How should people
710520	718840	approach you, Dan? On all fours, with, with a tray of whatever they are offering me on the back of
718840	726040	their neck. I don't know. I don't know. I swear to God, I don't know. I don't know. I really don't
726040	732600	know. I just, I just know when I'm being baited and I don't respond to it. Uh, what, sweetie, what?
734600	738840	Aaron's ejaculating. Aaron's crying out. Aaron's crying out. Don't, don't.
743320	744520	Aaron McGathey to the stage.
746680	751480	I apologize. I didn't mean to emote so out of play. When you said you don't know when you're
751480	757560	being baited, you, you, you, or you know, when you're being baited, you don't. Like that's the
757560	763000	thing is that because of those, because of those times when people have been trying to get something
763000	770360	from you, you, you are not able to distinguish between people actually saying, Dan Harmon, I,
771080	774920	I, I'm so embarrassed to talk to you because I don't feel like I'm good enough to talk to you,
774920	778840	but I admire you. You automatically think that they're the same person who's like,
778840	783720	Hey, I probably shouldn't be talking to you. Cause I'm, I don't know why I'm switching my voice,
783720	793560	but I'm speaking to myself, you and I at our relationship. Um, I sometimes when I, when I
793560	799400	am actually saying, I feel unattractive, I feel whatever your immediate reaction is. What do you
799400	804840	want me to say? You're like fine. And I'm like, no, I just, I'm just telling you. Like I just feel
805800	811640	bad, but if you were unable, which, which is why there's the new pad. Right. That's all. Yeah.
813080	817400	So-and-so wants me to think that their pants look good. Like, like, just say like,
817400	822440	I want you to think about my pants and then I'll write it down. Gloria pants are important to her.
822440	828280	And I'll write it down. I'm just saying this and I say this out of love, that not everyone is
828280	833320	fishing. And I think that like, it's, it's important to, to, you're saying every day,
833320	836840	everybody puts on pants that they think are shitty and just walks around going these pants,
836840	841800	whatever. Most of them are fishing. There's a difference. And there's a difference between
841800	846760	do I look fat in the shirt? I feel like I look fat and everyone's like, no, you don't like fat.
846760	852440	There's a difference between that. And I feel like I did a bad job on that. Or I feel like
852440	858840	there's a difference. You know, you, you, you romanticize your ass burgers, you know,
858840	862680	take it to the place of not being able to distinguish between the two things.
863320	866280	All right. All right. Thank you, Erin.
869400	874760	She'll be back. She did great. So, uh, uh,
874760	878360	Harman town is a, uh, feral audio. Jesus Christ.
881000	884120	No, no, no, baby. You didn't do bad. You did great.
884120	895320	She got a Marlin. Uh, this episode of Harman town is brought to you by Fulton and Roark.
895320	899480	Jeff, you're sick of, uh, spilling all your colognes all over the place. You hate liquid
899480	904280	colognes. Is that correct? It's my nemesis. It's the thing that gives me nightmare dreams
904280	908840	all night long. I can't remember how many times I've walked in on you just, just covered in
908840	914040	sticky wet cologne. I have traveled and broken a bottle of the cologne that I wear.
914520	918760	And then my luggage smells like a French whorehouse for the rest of time.
918760	923800	Yeah. But Fulton and Roark is a men's fragrance and grooming company that specializes in solid
923800	928200	colognes shave and shower products, all designed to make getting ready easier and more enjoyable.
928200	931400	Now, when you say solid colognes, do you mean like solid in the jazz sense? Like,
931400	936040	wow, that would, that jazz solo was solid. You know, I do mean that, but I also mean
936040	940520	physically solid as well. Oh, like a little, like you're talking about a waxed based cologne that
940520	945880	travels in a little small package that I can't spill all over my luggage and smell like a Mexican
946840	952040	tit house. So these are travel friendly wax based colognes that can go anywhere. Plus there's
952040	957320	nothing to break or spill. And of course they all smell fantastic. Fantastic. Like a Mexican tit

985560	990440	Well, that's amazing. That's, that's literally unbelievable. Did you know Spencer,
990440	995560	that GQ magazine just named their shave cream the very best on the market today? Well, yeah,
995560	999640	of course I knew that. Why, why would you ask? I mean, who am I asking? I mean, this guy,
999640	1004840	you go to this house, it's like an episode of hoarders. So many back issues of GQ magazine
1004840	1009320	there. Right. And I got to tell you, my house is made out of bricks of cologne. Wax based cologne,

1040040	1046360	different corporation by Fulton and Rourke. Got a lot to do tonight. Let's bring up,
1046360	1050280	I want to bring up a special friend from the Ferrell audio network. Again, Jeff,
1050280	1053560	listen, nobody's making any money. We're a network. It ain't me.
1054840	1058280	I just want to bring up my good friend, Johnny Pemberton. Johnny Pemberton, everybody.
1063480	1069240	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anywhere. Anything you want to do, grab either mic, grab both of them.
1069240	1074280	Yeah. Make yourself at home, man. Hey, how's it going? You got to get out of here.
1075320	1078920	This is the best way to get out of here. Do you do twisting the wind is the name of your podcast?
1078920	1082200	That's right. Twisting the wind. And you experiment with audio and
1083640	1089160	you're a little kid. You're a little baby kid. Yeah. I'm a baby child. I chew on like weird
1089160	1094360	little toys and then I see what sounds they make. They make a cool sound. I amplify it and run it
1094360	1100520	through the duty seven. And then I buy something on Amazon and that's how it works. That's basically
1100520	1105240	it. You're often a guest on my good friend, Duncan Trussell's podcast. I say good friend
1105240	1110840	in that I am fond of him. And you hung out with him three times. Yeah. I'm a better friend of
1110840	1119560	him. So yeah, I accept that. I'm going to choose this chair. You described an audition that you
1119560	1126360	went on. I heard this recently. I can't believe how far this is like proliferated. Is it coming
1126360	1131000	back to? No, it's not coming back to me, but I can't believe that it's like still like I've
1131000	1134760	forgotten about it. I've honestly forgotten about it. Like I wish I could do with other things, but
1135480	1139560	I have and now it's like, oh, you reminded me of this thing. Well, I think it's very resonant.
1140200	1144120	It's very interesting. Wasn't very far from here. Actually, physically was not very far from here.
1144120	1147480	You were in Duncan Trussell's podcast. You could go listen to the episode and you were describing
1147480	1151880	this brief experience that you had where you went in as a young actor going in or an old actor.
1151880	1158440	Who knows? Maybe you have some progeria. I don't know. You went into this thing and you experienced
1158440	1167160	the normal amount of like weird hierarchy, like odd fascistic casting culture. And you just bothered
1167160	1171960	to do what any normal human being would do under normal circumstances. Just go fuck yourself to
1171960	1177160	somebody who was acting weird to you. And it was like, they can go listen to the story about it. I
1177160	1182680	don't know. I was stricken with that. I never perceived you as a revolutionary. Oh, I have done
1182680	1188120	some bad stuff. Yeah. What's your, what are your politics? I don't know. I mean, I don't know if I
1188120	1195000	have true politics, but I kind of, uh, waver around. Like I'll sympathize with Al-Qaeda sometimes.
1195000	1198840	Every once in a while. Yeah. Every once in a while. Like I'm pretty much rooting for the underdog in all
1198840	1204440	situations. So, because I, I'm, I feel like I'm the underdog and always have been sort of an
1204440	1210120	underdog. So if, uh, if there's someone beating up a guy, if someone gives somebody a hard time,
1210120	1214360	I'll be there. Johnny Pemberton will be there. Yeah. Al-Qaeda has been getting a free ride for
1214360	1220040	too long. They have, you know. The poor bastards, everyone mispronounces their name. Like they can't
1220040	1225800	get like a generalized spelling. It's like Gaddafi. Like you can spell Gaddafi whoever you want. I
1225800	1229720	think of a whole different alphabet. We don't even know about that. It's too bad. I feel bad for them,
1229720	1238840	kind of. They're crazy. Uh, so, uh, how about, what was this? What kind of stuff could people,
1238920	1243560	I don't know. It's, it's awkward for people to sell themselves, but, uh, you know, people, uh,
1243560	1247400	tuning into your podcast, what are they, what are they, what are they looking for? You're looking
1247400	1253720	for any COVAX of audio. Oh yeah. There's a lot of sounds, a lot of, uh, communication, a lot of, uh,
1253720	1258520	prank phone calls, a significant amount of prank phone calls, but they're not really prank phone
1258520	1264760	calls. They're more just like phone calls. Can we do it? Can you pretend that I'm like a guy
1264760	1271160	working at just, um, just working at Halliburton. I work at, uh, I work at Halliburton. Or maybe work
1271160	1275960	at, um, this place that sells those things called zoomies. So these goggles you can put on, they're
1275960	1280360	like binoculars that are glasses. They're called zoomies. This was a recent call. It's pretty great.
1280360	1283960	All right. Let's see. Can we, can we do one? Okay. I'll do one. Here we go. Can you do one live?
1283960	1288200	All right. Do you want me to work at Halliburton or zoomy? Uh, how about zoomies? Okay. Zoomies. Yeah,
1288200	1292440	that's less political. Okay. Here's my phone. Here's my zoomies. The zoomies are goggles. What
1292520	1300120	are they? They're like goggles that you can wear. They're like, uh, they're like binoculars that you
1300120	1305000	can wear. They're binoculars that you can wear hands free. So you can like, oh, look at that.
1305000	1309320	I can touch myself while look at it. I think that's the idea. What am I, what am I looking at when I'm
1309320	1316760	wearing it? I think they're meant for like people who are creeps. So, so just, just, just high vision
1317080	1322280	voyeur goggles. Just binoculars. You wear it as a strap. Right. Cause you know, you can't, binoculars
1322280	1325400	are heavy and you have to hold onto them. But I think these ones are, these are hands-free
1325400	1332360	binoculars. So you can, Joe, you can pull out your JO tool. Okay. All right. So I got my phone and I
1332360	1341240	got my zoomie catalog and I got my, uh, hello, zoomie. Oh, hi. How's it going there? Hi. Uh, yes.
1341320	1347400	Can I help you with customer service department? Yeah. Yeah. I'm, I'm, uh, I'm really into these
1347400	1353080	whole things here that you got going on. I'm just wondering, can I wear them when I drive? Is that
1353080	1359160	okay? Uh, well, we don't recommend any usage for them other than just looking at things while you're
1359160	1365800	sitting in a chair. Okay. Okay. Well, I don't have any chairs. I don't, what is that exactly? I think
1365800	1370840	it's a, she don't have any chairs. Yeah. I don't have any. What kind of phone call is this?
1374680	1379880	Hey, listen, I just sit here. I'm just trying to go about my J by Mr. Harmon. I'm your supervisor.
1379880	1385480	What's the meaning of this? No, this guy's fucking insane. Put him on speaker phone. Let me hear
1385480	1393480	this. Sorry. I got my manager here. Hi. Hello. Yeah. You're being listened to for quality assurance
1393480	1399640	right now. Okay. That's great. I love quality assurance. Okay. Is it being recorded for quality
1399640	1408440	insurance as well? Quality insurance. What kind of phone call is this? Everybody, everybody gather
1408440	1416040	around the crazy person. Can I put my dad on? Is that okay? Sure. Yeah. Okay. He's from the south.
1416040	1423240	Okay. Hey, how y'all doing there? What the fuck is this guy? That's the southern guy on the phone
1423240	1428920	now. Hey, I have my son call you for a minute because he was trying to figure out to get
1428920	1434600	something to meet for birthday, but now he doesn't know where to do it. Dan, Dan, do cover commander.
1437320	1441720	I want to use your binoculars to destroy society.
1441720	1447480	Okay. Well, I just want to do it to look at birds and things. We're trying a lot going to
1447480	1458520	vacation this year, going down to Pickersner. Do you know? Okay. Thank you. Johnny Pemberton,
1458520	1469080	everybody. So there's prank phone calls and there's guests and yeah. You're an anarchist,
1469080	1474440	right? Like, like, yeah, you can say that. Yeah. You don't believe in hierarchy like me. Like,
1474440	1481320	I want to go to the moon and I want to create a society where no one's in charge. So sort of like,
1481320	1491160	uh, like, uh, it's like Randish. Randish. It's an Randish. I ran Randish. I wish. Yeah. It's not
1491160	1499720	like a, I haven't read her, but you can still say it. It's not like, uh, she's kind of the heroine
1499720	1503960	of the libertarian party, isn't she? Yeah. She's like the scapegoat. I feel like as well,
1503960	1509640	but libertarian, that's sort of like, Oh, uh, God made rich people rich and, uh, let's, let's all
1509640	1514200	have it out. Like, I don't really, well, it's like those Koch brothers, they consider themselves
1514200	1519400	libertarians, but they've become so rich. They've become the very thing they wanted to stop having
1519480	1524120	happened. I feel like, well, that's the thing. Like, like rich white guys like grew up, whose dad's
1524120	1528120	grew up in trailer parks. Like me, like your bootstrapper is like, that's, that's sort of part
1528120	1532600	of the problem. You become a libertarian because that's the way you cope with, with wealth. Like,
1532600	1537560	like, and it's the, it is the easiest route to do it. You, you, you go like, well, the, the system
1537560	1544040	worked for me, Teddy Roosevelt, the system worked for me, the system worked for me, the creatures of
1544040	1549880	South Park. Like, like we rose up through the thing. So it must work for everybody. So anybody
1549880	1553800	complaining is as guilty as anybody oppressing the people complaining. They say they don't like
1553800	1559160	government, but that the corporations and the free market, man, like the world should be run by Ford
1559160	1563640	Motors and GE and stuff like that, which is kind of already is like, it's like, they love, uh,
1563640	1569240	Liberty, but they hate society. I don't know. I don't, I don't get it. I went to somehow, uh,
1569240	1573000	because a friend of mine is involved with reason magazine and, uh, he was doing some things. So I
1573000	1578280	was at this convention in Vegas and there was a big, uh, libertarian convention. And my big
1578280	1581640	problem just from looking at it is like, and I actually said to somebody, I said, can I give
1581640	1585560	you guys one note on your movement? Like, if you're going to try to like make this an actual movement?
1585560	1587560	No problem. What do you, what's your note?
1587560	1593320	Less white guys and chinos. Like you have to get a couple of ladies in here and maybe a black dude,
1593960	1597640	because it's a bunch of white D bags walking around in the same pants and the same shirt with
1597640	1601320	the same cufflinks and talking about how money is the world's greatest thing.
1601560	1607400	The, the, the, the capitalism is fucking amazing. It's as amazing as sexual reproduction and biology.
1607400	1611400	It's, it's taking an organism and cutting it in half and saying, ladies on the left,
1611400	1616600	fellas on the right. And before you know it, you're not relying on like mutation to, uh,
1616600	1621640	change the species. It's fantastic, but it's not something you should base like society on.
1621640	1622600	Everything on.
1622600	1627640	Yeah. Because, because when you step over a homeless dude on the sidewalk,
1627640	1632760	you're, you're, the reason you're doing it is because there's absolutely nothing to profit
1632760	1640600	you in stepping over him. So obviously we have a system that right or wrong, good or bad,
1640600	1645880	whatever your definition is, what we know for sure is that there's some dudes on the sidewalk
1645880	1651400	that it's not working for. Because unless that guy loves the sidewalk, loves it so much,
1652280	1656920	he's kissing it. And like, but, but even still, it doesn't work because there's a sidewalk,
1656920	1662040	the guy that is a sidewalk outside a donut shop. And the guy's going, get out of my sidewalk.
1662040	1664360	Stop kissing it. You love it so much. Get out of here.
1664360	1666440	Bringing the value of the donuts down.
1666440	1671000	Yeah, exactly. Like no one wants to step over you to buy a donut. You're lowering the value of my
1671000	1677000	donut shop. So there's, there's, capitalism is an engine, but it's not the chassis. It's
1677000	1682600	not the axle. It's not the tires, you know, it's like, uh, make shit go fast.
1682600	1687720	It's, it's, it's incredibly ingenious because capitalism simply is an agreement we all make
1687720	1693560	every day. We wake up and decide that we let's all go sell our practical activity. And what we get
1693560	1699480	back, uh, is like less than what our actual activity is worth. So if we go out and make cars
1699480	1704360	for eight hours a day, um, we don't get paid in the amount of cars that we made or worth because
1704360	1707960	that wouldn't make any money for the, for the capitalists. So we, they, we're going to pay you
1707960	1713240	a lot less than what the car is worth. And that free part of our labor, which is almost all of it.
1713240	1717560	That's what makes that that's capitalism. We've all just agreed. We agree every morning when we
1717560	1723080	get up, let's all just go sell activity our most of our day. And we only, if you actually have a
1723080	1728040	real job, you only get a couple hours of your day to do anything, uh, that you want to do. That's,
1728040	1733320	it's insanity. Maybe not at all. And they are. And if you have, you know, like you have a couple hours
1733320	1740200	to, to, to spend with your family or make a model airplane. It's dangerous. There's a solution.
1740200	1744040	Capitalism doesn't have to be scrapped. Johnny Pemberton told the story on Doug and Drussell
1744040	1753240	podcast. Johnny Pemberton goes in for an audition. There's this whole existing system that results in
1753240	1758680	people treating everyone like crap down to the bottom. So you walk into this fluorescent lit
1758680	1763240	fucking tiny office with some lady that knows nothing about acting, knows nothing about anything.
1763400	1767960	But, but, but is sitting there like a troll under a bridge, treating actors like shit.
1767960	1771880	This is a thing in LA. You're sitting, you're listening in Iowa and you're going, fuck you,
1771880	1778280	your actors got it so bad. We're telling you this is the equivalent of welding a fucking thing in LA.
1778280	1784440	Like every, every town has its industry. There's a lot of people like, like suffering out here.
1784440	1790280	So Johnny walks into, he tells the story on Duncan's podcast. He walks in and he starts talking.
1790280	1794520	There's a lady talking to another guy. They're talking, talking. He sees another guy and they're
1794520	1798680	talking and he hears something and she's going, there's no talking in here. And he goes, oh,
1798680	1804200	I'm sorry. I thought that you, you guys were talking. So it was okay to talk in here. And
1804200	1810120	then the other guy goes, oh, that's a good way to talk to casting. And long story short,
1810120	1815480	the story ends with you dropping your script on the ground and saying, fuck you and walking away.
1816120	1823720	That's how capitalism works. The capitalism can work. Every time you get a call from a,
1823720	1829880	from a telemarketer, capitalism could work if the people calling you like cold calling you to go,
1829880	1836520	if, if they bothered to go, fuck you, there's a limit. There's a limit to my humanity. Anyways,
1836520	1841080	I've done, I sound like a libertarian when I say that. It's okay to be a little bit libertarian,
1841160	1846200	isn't it? I think, I think that spirit. Yeah. But I think when you have a billion dollars and
1846200	1849960	you're a libertarian, you should probably like start to become a Democrat. She started church.
1852040	1856680	I know. I think when you're like in the stratosphere as a libertarian, you should probably realize a
1856680	1859720	lot of what libertarians I've talked to you say, it sounds like kind of stuff I believe in. Like,
1859720	1863960	like, like I don't like government. I hate the idea of like arbitrary, like, you know,
1863960	1868600	like rule and stuff like that. But they stopped short of the idea. Like, like they worship money.
1868600	1873800	They worship the, they worship capitalism. And so they, they talk this kind of high and mighty
1873800	1878840	idealism about like, we should all just be like, liberty, man, like, like, no one should tell you
1878840	1882760	ever what to do. But it's like capitalism is the whole point of this. It tells everybody what to do.
1882760	1887560	And this necessitates unemployment. There has to be unemployed people. There has to be famine.
1887560	1892680	There has to be a conflict at all times to keep profits. There has to be, we have to let more food
1892680	1896360	rot every day than is needed to feed everybody every day to keep fucking grain prices at the
1896360	1901480	same place. That's insanity. That's, that's a chaotic, that's a chaotic idea. And so fuck
1901480	1908760	libertarians is what I'm trying to say. Yeah. And fuck Ayn Rand. Fuck Ayn Rand. Your book sucks.
1910920	1914360	Nobody likes the fountainhead unless they're a cock and like it's 13 and they're fucking this.
1914360	1921320	Like, no, it's not a good book. She is dead though. She died. Yeah, she had a good run.
1921320	1926440	Let's go dig her up and fuck her. You know what? Also, just show me what you want. Let's do it.
1926440	1931560	Jeff, she had terrible teeth. Did she really? Yeah. So, fuck her, man. See, I thought you,
1931560	1936520	I thought you were ready for the underdog. Well, I don't consider those teeth to be underdog teeth.
1937880	1944280	Would you rather fuck Ayn Rand's corpse or be a member of Al Qaeda? Al Qaeda. Okay, let's go.
1944280	1951160	All right. Johnny Pemberton from, uh, Pearl, are you trusting the wind? Wind, I don't know.
1951160	1955320	Cheers. Come on, guys. What are we going to do?
1958920	1959400	Thank God.
1965720	1972440	See you, brother. I feel like, I feel like every time I've seen Johnny Pemberton, he has, uh,
1972440	1978680	decreased in age by three years. He keeps, he keeps cutting his hair shorter. He looked to be
1978680	1983720	about 15. He was a channel one-on-one kid, like, a million years ago. And I was like, ah, he's kind
1983720	1988600	of got the Michael Cera adorable thing going. And then Michael Cera now, it looks like, uh, Michael
1988600	1995800	Kane. Does he really? And Johnny Pemberton waited it out. He was like, I remember the first time I
1995800	2001960	saw Pemberton, I was like, ah, fuck, he must be so pissed about, uh, Michael Cera. But now it's,
2001960	2005320	it's a million years later. Fucking Michael Cera looks like Loch Ness Monster.
2007160	2011560	Pemberton's got the fucking lockdown on the adorable little baby face. You said that Michael
2011560	2018120	Cera has aged poorly. He just looks like, he doesn't, he no longer looks like Johnny Pemberton.
2018120	2025320	Like, let me say, let's leave it at that. There was a point when they looked the same to me.
2025400	2028680	Is that right? Yeah. Okay. I guess I don't see enough of Michael Cera walking around.
2028680	2036120	Well, well, our next guest is Michael Cera. That'd be so awesome. He comes out with a walker.
2039080	2042520	He looks like the Loch Ness Monster. Nobody knows what the Loch Ness Monster looks like.
2045400	2051000	It's a terrible analogy. I don't know. People, people grow old and they die.
2055320	2059560	We're going to go to Loch Ness around the holidays. Yeah. We're taking a trip to Scotland
2059560	2064040	and, uh, we're going to go, we're going to go to Inverness. Do we have any, uh, moon, uh,
2065480	2071160	problems that need to be, uh, discussed? That the subreddit Jeff was abuzz about Lizette.
2072360	2075160	Yeah. Is Lizette here? Yes. Hello, Lizette. Really?
2077160	2083400	Welcome back. Yeah. The show last week kind of seems like a month ago. Um, I never, I didn't
2083480	2087240	quite understand why the room turned on, on Lizette like that. It got, it got, it got funky.
2087240	2093480	I think they didn't like her. Like, like, like, but that's not a cool reason to like,
2093480	2098920	chant someone down. And I will, I will immediately say like, I, I, because a lot of the, if you go
2098920	2103320	through the subreddit online, like a lot of the sentiment is like, why didn't Dan do something?
2103320	2108280	He's the mayor. And I'll tell you why. I was bored with the topic of like what was going on.
2108520	2113400	I wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons, but moreover, uh, like I was sort of like, how do
2113400	2118680	you, how do you resolve something like this? Like there's this mob rule emerging. And I think what
2118680	2124520	happened is it's LA and like, she said something that was like technically not appropriate to,
2125160	2132360	you know, it's like, I absolutely, everybody that sort of voiced a, uh, uh, oh, that's not true.
2132360	2136360	What you're saying isn't true. It's an outdated thing and it's gone on too long. It's got too
2136360	2141560	much momentum. And there was, was it you ma'am? Sorry, I have Asperger's, but yeah. Okay. You, you,
2141560	2146600	you stood up and identified yourself and you said, you spoke very eloquently as an individual,
2146600	2152920	as an individual would you said like, okay, so, uh, uh, uh, this is a stereotype that proceeds,
2152920	2160040	you know, uh, uh, straight people like, like constantly look at gay people and say, uh,
2160040	2166200	there's, there's a dude and a girl within every gay relationship. And it's, it's probably enough
2166200	2172040	time has passed to put, put a, you know, hold that, that the puppy of that misconception's
2172040	2179400	face into its own urine. But, but that's what you're doing. It's like, it's like shows. Um,
2179400	2185880	it doesn't, I mean, like there was a kind of a thing happened last, uh, week that was that,
2185880	2191000	I don't think has ever happened at Harmon's. Somebody got booed. It happened. It happened so
2191000	2194840	suddenly too. It's like a switch was thrown and all of a sudden, was that what they were really
2194840	2200440	chanting was let it go because they wanted her to stop talking. Right. They weren't, they weren't
2200440	2206040	saying, uh, think differently. They were going, let it go. Was that, was that what's your take
2206040	2212920	on the whole thing? How do you feel it all went down? Uh, let it go. Sorry. I'm joking. I'm sorry.
2213560	2216120	Do you want to come up? Should we get her, get her up and let her say a couple of words or?
2216120	2228920	All right. Yeah. Let's have a little kega dynamite. Hello, Lizette. Uh,
2230600	2235720	so, uh, what, what the thing that you were going to say was anecdotal things about how you,
2235720	2242840	you, well, whatever, say, say what you were going to say. Um, wait, which part?
2242840	2248840	Well, when they remember when the audience started going boo, let it go. Let it go. Stop talking.
2248840	2255320	We hate you. Stop talking. I guess, I guess the only point I wanted to get across was, um,
2256200	2262440	regardless of where you come from, nothing like that. Uh, you know, it's funny about weddings
2262440	2268520	because I actually did work at a wedding shop and I, I saw some people are a little bit more
2268520	2274760	about, uh, weddings as far as, uh, some people are just let, they let one person do more work
2274760	2279640	than the other regardless of who it is, you know, that kind of thing. That's not, that's not a gender
2280280	2286440	thing. That was a more of the ideal topic. That's ideally, that's what I wanted to say.
2286440	2290600	Right. I think we went over that, but how do you feel emotionally after that? Was that,
2290600	2293400	was that a, was that a weird experience for you? No, this was like the best week of my life,
2293400	2297960	but not because of like what happened here. Just other things that in my life was like,
2297960	2302200	this has been a really great week for me, but I, I tend not to let things bother me at all. I'm
2302200	2307240	not that kind of person. Well, I think people resented that a little bit. That's what I truly
2307240	2311640	think. I want, I want to say this. Like I think that like clearly, cause I listened to the thing
2311640	2315480	and I listened to the podcast when I drive into work and I'm listening to it and I'm like, oh,
2315480	2320440	that's how I do feel. I have remorse. I feel, I feel bad if I did offend anyone. Obviously. Yeah.
2320440	2324520	Everybody that talks into a microphone, like can look, listen to it afterwards and go, oh shit,
2324520	2330120	I wish I could have taken like that Peter Parker, like 45 minutes of like bullet time
2330120	2334280	to think exactly about what to say. And we all embarrassed ourselves. Like, like, like,
2334280	2339640	but, but I think that you, okay. Let it out. It's all good. Let it out. Thank you. Thank you.
2341400	2345720	Here's the thing that the whole thing, that kind of avalanche shit on me that night was like,
2345720	2352120	it was no time to talk about it at all. But I, what I wanted to say to the planet at that moment
2352120	2360040	was, we have gone so far with like, it's okay to be black. It's okay to be gay. It's okay to be
2360040	2364440	in a wheelchair. It's okay to have one arm. It's okay to have three arms. It's okay to have purple
2364440	2369640	hair. It's okay to have six eyes. It's okay to have one eye. Like we are trying as hard as we
2369640	2374280	can to keep each other from keeping each other down. It's okay to wear a notebook around here.
2374280	2380680	Yes. Totally. The only thing that we have, like, is there going to come a point where it's okay
2380680	2390920	to be ignorant? Where it's okay to be shitty? Because if we don't, if we don't make that bridge,
2390920	2397400	we, we ain't got no hope, man. There's a word for groups of people who know it's okay to have six
2397400	2405480	eyes. They're called six eyed people. They exist in a fucking ghetto of six eyed people. If they
2405560	2413320	don't, like this movement that we have, let's all realize that our sexual preference, our race,
2413320	2418920	our height, our hair color, everything doesn't matter. We've gotten to the point where we are
2418920	2427960	storming the Bastille. Every time Bill Maher opens his mouth, all I hear is the fucking hammers
2427960	2435080	cocking on the red states like shotguns. Is there a way to reach out to these people and
2435080	2442040	hug them? Isn't there a way to make ourselves attractive to people that are bummed out,
2442040	2451480	that are apprehensive about becoming part of the board cube? Are we just going to shout at
2451480	2456920	everybody that isn't as open minded as us? Is that what we're going to do? Is that how we're going
2456920	2465080	to achieve revolution? Are we just going to shout at people? No, we shouldn't. Right. So, so,
2465080	2469800	so when you, when you run into someone on the street and they go like, I think black people
2469800	2475480	aren't as tall as white people, are you, are you going to, what are you going to do to that guy?
2476120	2477560	Are you going to hit him in the head with a brick?
2480920	2484120	I would give, I would give him a hug or something and be like, no, no,
2484120	2491720	that would give him a hug. No, no, no, it would be more like, no, no, no, no. Black people are
2491720	2499160	just as tall as white people. I just want to know. You just compare black people to six-eyed
2499160	2505800	people and ignorant people. You put them in the same category of disability. No, I didn't.
2505800	2509720	You did. If you said it's okay to be black, it's okay to be gay, it's okay to be a mutant.
2509720	2516520	I don't. You gave black people the right to be okay about being crazy.
2517320	2522440	I don't know what you're talking about, but I do know one thing that every, everything that
2522440	2527800	we talk about, we're trying to move forward into a Roddenberry universe where there is no such
2527800	2535240	thing as hierarchy. And the way we're trying to accomplish it is we're trying to use the tools
2535240	2543640	that the old world used. We are trying to march on Washington. We are trying to show people that
2543640	2551400	mob rule like works. Those were the tools that they showed us are effective. That was the
2551400	2557720	justification. Do you really think that we're going to enter a world where there's so many
2557720	2563720	transgendered 16-year-olds that they finally get a vote in Congress? Or do you think the more
2563720	2570040	objective, pragmatic goal should be for us to arrive at a point of consciousness where we stop
2570040	2576200	judging people for these things that have nothing to do with the streets getting cleaned and the
2576200	2585720	economy being balanced? They have trapped us in this rat's maze. They tell us that, oh, yeah,
2586440	2592520	I'm sure you'd love a handicap ramp at the YMCA. You go get six more cripples and talk to me later.
2592600	2599880	It's bullshit. It's fucking horseshit. Capitalism is wrong because a dollar ends up being worth
2599880	2605640	more than some human being that you're stepping over. That's it. If a group full of people,
2605640	2609080	intelligent people like this audience here, decide that they don't like what's going on
2609080	2612680	on stage, they have every right to go, boo, fuck that. No, they don't. No, they don't.
2613640	2618520	They have every right to do it, but I think they're assholes. That's bullying.
2618520	2622040	Oh, I'm used to that. I've been bullying my whole life. It's cool.
2624840	2629640	I think that a crowd that boos is taking part in something ugly.
2629640	2634440	People weren't linking arms. Is it cool? Can we pillory her? Can we burn her with a steak?
2634440	2635960	It wasn't that. People were saying, fucking boos.
2635960	2637000	I'm using that too, actually.
2637000	2637880	You used to be pilloried?
2637880	2638600	Yeah. No, I'm kidding.
2638600	2640280	Okay. Kinky.
2642680	2645960	Nobody here was being a villain out in the audience. They all agreed as one that it didn't
2645960	2650120	like what was for sale on stage. I think that's healthy and fine, right?
2650120	2653240	It's healthy and fine to take part in a large group of people
2654200	2656360	saying the same thing in unison, chanting it at people.
2657400	2661400	If everybody is in agreement, people were going along with it, swept up in the commotion and the
2661400	2666840	emotion of a mob, and that's not okay. I think there were 15, 20 people in the audience going,
2666840	2670440	like, no, I don't like it, fucking move it along. I think that's-
2670440	2672600	Well, then we're not going to get anything ever done here.
2672680	2676840	But you can't mandate that this audience doesn't have the right to ever go, fuck that shit.
2676840	2678760	No, you're right. You're right. I can't mandate that.
2679320	2682360	You're right. I can't say you don't have the right to boo.
2682360	2685960	There are things that you could do on the stage that can absolutely alienate and bum
2685960	2689160	everybody out in this room. There's things that you could go too far and you could piss people
2689160	2691960	off, and they have the freedom and the right to say, that's fucking bullshit,
2691960	2696280	and let's throw shit at that guy. That's totally fair.
2697320	2700280	I think what happened, it was weird last week because all of a sudden, as one,
2700280	2705880	everyone just turned on you, Lisette, and it was a strange dynamic that just went boom,
2705880	2710120	and all of a sudden you were like- Like I said, I admit I said
2710120	2715320	something that was a little, that it was not appropriate. I should have revised my speech
2715320	2720600	and say it, reflect my opinion in a way that was more diplomatic, obviously. And like I said,
2720600	2725400	I never meant to offend anyone. But had I just been given five more seconds, I would have
2725400	2728200	explained myself and I would have been like, actually what I meant to say was,
2728200	2731560	and it would have been fine. I thought, I think.
2731560	2733640	I don't think you would have. I think you would have accepted more.
2734920	2740200	That's the thing. It's about the booing and the chanting and all that shit. That's all.
2741640	2746760	This hero worship, this idea that we have to find the person that says the right things and we have
2746760	2752280	to lift them up. Yeah, if it makes anyone feel better, I have never said the right thing ever
2752280	2758840	in my life, and I probably never will, so that only makes me human, but I hope you feel my pain.
2759880	2761880	Let's feel as it's pain. Thank you for coming up here.
2761880	2763080	Thank you, thank you.
2766280	2767800	Let's chant a rough stage, everybody.
2767800	2782680	What's that guy's name? Greg.
2782680	2784360	All right. Because I wrote it down.
2786040	2787800	All right, let's bring Spencer up. All right.
2788760	2799320	Hello, Spencer. The inventor of iHarmon or a chest note, so whatever you want to call it.
2799960	2805800	Do you have a name for your invention, Spencer? If I were to write in permanent marker on the
2805800	2811240	cover, I would write Harmon's Brain. Yeah, just because that's what it does.
2811240	2814360	But if you wanted to market this invention to other people, I wouldn't.
2814360	2818200	You wouldn't. Marketing's just lies.
2821000	2828200	Speaking of marketing, I would want to point out that the iHarmon Mach 3 is equipped with
2828200	2834760	paracord, which can support up to 330 pounds, so that can save someone's life or maybe, you know,
2834760	2840760	strangle a foe. Yeah. I like the idea that if I die, someone can take it off my neck and they
2840760	2844600	can know what I was working on when I... Yeah. But also, if somebody wanted to murder Dan,
2844600	2846280	he's already got a... I didn't want... Yeah.
2846280	2849560	He's already got a strangled item around. Wrong attention to that.
2850680	2856920	Seems counterintuitive to get my employer killed. There's a built-in drunk-o-meter,
2856920	2861080	which the subreddit has requested, because you can see from my handwriting,
2862440	2866760	at the bottom of this page, it just says in this weird serial killer scroll, I do what I want.
2871320	2874520	Like, it strikes at the top with, like, cat litter,
2875480	2879640	dog food, and then at the bottom, it says, I do what I want. You can barely read it.
2879640	2888040	Then underneath it, Greg. That's something that a phone can't store, is the manic energy.
2889240	2894360	So you feel that the convenience of having this always around your neck outweighs the awkwardness
2894360	2898520	of having that around your neck at all times? No, I'll get through it. I mean, there's an awkward
2898920	2902440	thing. I don't think this lasts very long. My prediction is you don't stick to this for very
2902440	2904360	long. I'm not going to let that affect how long I wear it.
2905080	2909320	Nor should it. I'm just saying, I put it out there. I don't think you would be affected by
2909320	2913400	this. I think that this is a thing. It's a passing fancy. I've broken through a threshold. You know,
2913400	2919480	like, what's his name? Star Counter. What's his name? Carl Sagan? Stephen Hawking.
2919480	2925320	Oh. Star Counter.
2925320	2929320	He was a heavy drinker, party guy. Like, I saw a documentary about him. Like, he
2930200	2934920	fucked around. Like, he was smart and he had a good time. And then one day he was, like,
2934920	2938680	hanging out like, I'll see you later. I'm going to smash that bus and I'll see you.
2938680	2945640	And then he, like, tumbled down some stairs and went to a doctor and they said, you got a disease.
2946280	2952680	You're a balloon and you're going to deflate. And the clock's ticking. And he went, I got some shit
2952680	2957880	to do. Now, he was very young when he got that wake-up call. And he, obviously, all of humanity
2957880	2964040	has benefited from him doing that. I'm just a 40-year-old hack. Like, I just want to, like,
2964040	2969640	I clearly, I can feel my brain has gotten to a point where, like, I'm not thinking anything
2969640	2973720	that's going to help anybody anymore. I just, I just got to, like, you know, like the guy in,
2974440	2977720	wearing a notebook around your neck certainly sends off a message of you give up.
2979640	2984200	There's a surrender kind of white flag being waved at. Yeah, exactly. It's a white flag to
2984200	2988680	every 25-year-old writer. Like, come up to me and go, like, like, what should I do? I don't know. Let
2988680	2996760	me see. I don't know. Look through. My brain don't work no more. Yeah. I'm gonna, I'm gonna,
2996760	3002360	yeah, I'm gonna go out, like, practical. Like, if I could turn my shoe into a phone, I'd do it.
3002440	3007880	I don't know if that was practical. Yeah. Is that practical? Spencer, I don't know yet.
3009720	3015160	I'm gonna find out. I came to you with this idea. This was your, you helped me with this. Oh, yeah.
3018200	3023720	I mean, I don't know what else to say about it. Why don't you have one of these? Because I have,
3023720	3029800	well, I have a green moleskin thing that I have, so I have one. I just don't have it around my neck.
3030760	3036040	But the important thing about this is, it's fast. Yeah, no, that's, I designed it that way.
3040600	3046680	That was, that was literally, I guess I'm just more of a, of a superficial fashion-conscious guy.
3046680	3051480	You're behind me, right, on this, right? Yeah, I think it's probably one of the best methods you
3051480	3055320	could do it, because it was like you're illustrating with your phone. I'd say, you know,
3055320	3059640	it's kind of like a camera in that, you know, your note-taking device is the one you have with you.
3059640	3064360	So that's always with you. Yeah. But, you know, it's, it's hard to have your phone out all the
3064360	3068840	time, but I'd say the phone's the best. But if you're not going to use your phone, that's better.
3068840	3073800	It seems a bit like a social barrier, though. Maybe that's, maybe that's part of your subconscious,
3073800	3078600	like a charm of this. It's an icebreaker, really. I'm hanging out with you. I'm hanging out with
3078600	3083240	you. Start hanging out with me now. Is Benicio del Toro going to be like, oh, oh, this is dead
3083240	3089560	hard. Like, like, oh, oh, oh, oh, God, the friendship that never ended. Like, like, come on,
3089560	3095880	I got you and I got a rock. I got a dog. I hang out with you and now you got a big
3098200	3101800	can you handle it? And what we were, we were having drinks earlier on and you spent half the
3101800	3105400	time looking at your little notepad. It's just, it's just a toy that you could not let make icons
3105400	3111000	shot and stuff down. Yeah. Sometimes you weren't, you were just looking through your thing.
3111000	3116440	It's just a way to make less icons. You're enforcing your, your lack of ability to connect
3116440	3120520	with people. He's doing it right now. He's doing it right now. I'm looking up stuff that I was
3120520	3123640	writing down. Sure you are. You're just getting, you're just, you're just shy. You're just, you're,
3123640	3128920	you're terrible about being with other people. You're, you're, you're terrible about being with
3128920	3137720	me. Thank you. Hey, where do you get those notepads, Jeff? These ones? Yeah. Look at that. That's,
3137880	3142440	I went to two staples. They didn't have anything. So I got that one and I cut it with a paper cutter.
3145480	3151400	These are from Dwayne. I don't know. D-O-A-N-E paper. And there's a gift shop and sort of like,
3151400	3155960	I'll buy you a pack. Okay. That's awesome. They're good. I just want to do a quick, quick,
3155960	3160760	quick lightning, Harmon town, like quick guest spot. Okay. Can we just do this real quick? Hell
3160760	3167240	yeah. Can I bring up my neighbors? Absolutely. Dan and Beth Butsen. Butsens.
3172520	3179080	Can they both, unless, unless you guys don't want to come up, I just want to do a quick hello. Hello, Beth.
3179080	3186600	Dan and Beth Butsen. Dan and Beth Butsen. Their last name is, yeah.
3189160	3193720	Are these, are these the same Butsens that you, uh, that you said disparaging things about in a
3193720	3198920	previous podcast? I didn't say disparaging things. We went, we went to their, uh, uh, backyard party
3198920	3206280	and then we came here and then, uh, yeah, I talked for, for Harmon town aficionados, uh, Beth Butsen
3206280	3215720	is the person I referred to as the tumor lady who had a, like you took out your iPhone and you
3215720	3222280	had an x-ray of your head, like a profile of it. And truly am I exaggerating? It was the size of a
3222840	3231960	beyond a golf ball. Well, my, I had a brain tumor last year and, um, initially how I found out I had
3232040	3238520	a brain tumor was at, um, I swim laps at, uh, in Pasadena at the Rose Bowl Aquatic Center and I had
3238520	3244200	a seizure in the pool. And what does a seizure feel like? Like, or what, what happens? It was the
3244200	3250840	very first time I'd ever had one. It's the only one I've ever had, but, um, I can remember, um, it,
3250840	3255720	and it happened so quickly. It almost feels like you're passing out, except I can remember that
3256520	3264440	I felt like, um, like I didn't have control of my limbs. And, um, and luckily I was swimming on my
3264440	3270520	back in the water and, um, there was the lifeguard exchange, which is apparently the most dangerous
3270520	3276760	time for a lifeguard to even see somebody drowning. Um, but apparently. What do you mean? Like,
3276760	3280760	that was shift change or? Yes. Yes. Because they're talking to each other. They're just hanging out.
3280760	3290280	Yeah. They're hanging out. It's hard to be a live good. Yes. And there was a lifeguard that all
3290280	3295000	the other lifeguards made fun of because he was the overly diligent one. And he's the one who
3295000	3300920	happened to see me, uh, drowning, flailing in the pool. Yes. Um, and it's in the, it's in the
3300920	3306760	competitive pool where all the swimmers that swim there are very, very good swimmers. So at first
3306760	3310840	they thought we have a winner pay attention to the swimmers because everybody knows how to swim.
3310840	3316360	It's not like guarding the little kiddie pool or something like that. So I had my seizure and
3316360	3324280	luckily they, um, saw me and they jumped in and, or one of the guys, uh, jumped in,
3324280	3330360	they were all there, but one of them, uh, alarmed everybody else. Um, the other one, another one
3330360	3336200	jumped in and, um, basically pushed my head up out of the water and let me finish having my seizure.
3336200	3339720	Jesus. Yes. And then after that, so they got underneath you and they're like, she's having
3339720	3344840	a seizure. They just lifted you, just my head. So they just lifted my head up out of the water.
3344840	3350280	So I wouldn't take in any water and they let me finish having my seizure. And then they pulled me
3350280	3355960	to the end. They had already called the ambulance and, um, I was rushed to Huntington hospital,
3355960	3364200	which is about four minutes away. And, um, when I was there, I was, I had already come to in the
3364200	3369640	ambulance and, um, I felt very lucky because you know how you have to always wait for somebody to
3369640	3377880	take care of you when you're in the ER. I didn't have any weight at all. And, um, the, uh, doctor
3377880	3386920	walked in and he told me that it was my lucky day because I had the chief neurologist on call that
3386920	3392840	day. And that was him like the native American guy, right? Yes. Yeah. He said, I'm, I'm doctor
3392840	3397400	Kayden and I'm your, and I'm the chief neurologist here and I'm going to take care of me. Big chief
3397400	3405320	neurologist. I didn't even know that's what you're doing. I thought you were just making it more
3405320	3409640	dramatic. I didn't know he was doing a pun. I thought like, I thought he was making it more
3409640	3417000	dramatic. Like it was like, uh, I think I did. So God damn it. The brain tumor, the brain tumor
3417000	3423240	was very big. And right now I have a hole in my brain, the size of a meatball and that's the hole
3423240	3432760	a size of a delicious meatball, like some bullshit meatball from chef. Are we talking
3432760	3439320	Italian sweet meatballs? We're talking like IKEA Swedish. Little Dom. So that's big. That's like
3439320	3444760	a wiffle ball size. And that was, he took out basically about half of the tumor. So half of
3444760	3449640	the tumor is still in there. Wait, just hanging out in there? Yeah, it's in there. And he didn't
3449640	3455000	want to go any further. Um, he didn't want to take any more out because he was a, he didn't want me
3455000	3460280	to end up in a wheelchair or, uh, talking with a drool. So is it just sitting in there that you
3460280	3463560	have to go back every day? Well, I went, he said, he goes, we're going to take care of the rest of
3463560	3470600	it with cyber knife. Cyber knife. Radiation treatment. Wait, can they make that sound a
3470600	3477000	little more ominous? Yeah, I know. A little more like G.I. Joe? Yeah. Bring out cyber knife. Cyber
3477000	3484040	knife. What does that mean? A weeks later, um, probably about a month later after I'd already
3484040	3489320	had the surgery and stuff, they took me and, um, it's a whole procedure where there's like this big
3489320	3496520	Star Wars gun, um, that's in this room and they have already made a mask of your face and they
3496520	3501160	basically screwed, you know, I'm in the mask and they screwed me to the table and the table's
3501160	3505240	kind of moving like this and this big, uh, Star Wars gun. They have to custom make the
3505240	3509880	mask of your face? Yeah, yeah, we still have it. It's like a gauze except they have some liquid on
3509880	3515400	it. And, um, because it's that precise, like, like, so it has to be a mask of your face. Yeah, it
3515400	3521000	matches my face exactly. To hold you, to hold you in place or? Yeah, they don't want my head
3521000	3526200	moving. Right. While cyber knife has given you the business. Yeah, so I'm there for a whole hour.
3526200	3532840	I pictured you strapped to a table like James Bond and Goldfinger. Do you expect me to talk,
3532840	3538040	chief neurologist? Yeah, it's kind of that way. I mean, I showed him the, I showed him the, uh,
3538040	3543240	uh, little video clip I have of it. It's a cartoon. It's not a video. Like, you show me photos of,
3543240	3550280	it is a car. It's like a cartoon. It's like the MRI photos. It's a human skull, like from it,
3550280	3555880	from viewed from the side. And there is a larger than golf ball. We're perfectly round.
3556600	3562600	That's what's amazing is the, like this cancer still adheres to this. Mine was,
3562600	3567800	I had a very, very rare kind. Mine was non-cancerous, but you said, well, I mean,
3567800	3573160	that thing of it is, is you could have a brain tumor that's cancerous and you might be fine
3573240	3577800	depending on what stage they catch it in. How can a tumor not be cancerous? But you could have one
3577800	3583240	that's non-cancerous. And depending on where that brain tumor is, if it's right here by your brain
3583240	3590280	stem here, you could be dead. Right. So it, whether it's cancerous or non-cancerous, it, it, um,
3590280	3593400	doesn't decide whether or not you're going to live. So you're just this lucky person that just
3593400	3597480	had this gigantic thing. I've had a very, very rare type of brain tumor. You could see from an outer
3597560	3602600	space. It was so big. Yeah. They just scooped it out with a melon baller, left some of it behind.
3603400	3608040	And it's still in there. What did they replace that space with? Or they just leave a cavity in there?
3608040	3615560	No, it just fills in with liquid. And then all the, all the, uh, but don't, don't. And, and,
3615560	3620760	but, um, they said eventually that, um, all the little veins and cap cap, you know, things that,
3621000	3630440	um, capillaries will, uh, make connections again. And like half my body was very weak. I was in a
3630440	3638440	walker. I couldn't walk for about a full month without, um, falling or perhaps having a seizure.
3638440	3643800	So I had to, I was in a walker for about a month and then I eventually grew, uh, graduated to a
3643800	3648680	cane. Did they ever tell you, did they ever tell you, you may not walk again and blah, blah, blah,
3649080	3654760	they're always worried about that. But, um, luckily I have a very, very good surgeon. And, um,
3654760	3662760	the other thing, um, what was I going to say? It's okay. You have a hole in your, yeah. Yeah.
3662760	3670760	Yeah. You have the ultimate out. Yeah. You should have a notepad around your neck.
3672680	3675480	Have you ever used it to win arguments? Really? Be honest.
3675720	3679240	You know what I was going to say was because, you know, when they, um,
3680440	3684440	when they said, when they were going to do the surgery, what they do is they usually shave your
3684440	3689080	whole head. But my mom and my sister were very worried about my hair. They said, you know, can't
3689080	3693080	you just leave some of it, maybe put a, you know, flap in or something like that. See the strange
3693080	3701400	thing to be worried about. She has such nice hair. And what my doctor was very considered,
3701400	3708920	he just shaved me up here on top and then they, um, you know, cut open the scalp and roll that back.
3708920	3716200	Barf. Yeah. And then, and then they drill, he, they drill into the skull and he wanted to put a metal
3716200	3721000	plate in my head. And I remember him telling me what, that he was going to do that. And I said,
3721000	3724840	do you have to put the metal plate in? He says yes. Cause I might have to go in over and over
3724840	3728920	again. I said, well, just can't you just put my skull back? And then if you have to go in a second
3728920	3735000	time, then you'll put the metal plate in. And he said, okay, I can do that. Wait, you can just negotiate
3735000	3741000	with your doctor. Yeah. So I do have my skull. I just pictured myself going through the airport
3741000	3748440	and that beeper going on. Oh, how embarrassing. Yeah. And also I wondered if it would affect my
3748440	3753240	hair. But that would be, I would, I would love that. I would go like, it would start beeping. I'd go,
3753240	3761800	I had a fucking tumor. I know it's sauntered through, throw shoes at them. How many tumors have
3761800	3768920	you had motherfucker? Well, you know what? And the thing of it is, is I actually consider this
3768920	3775800	one of the best things that has ever happened to me because I feel like I've had so many gifts
3775800	3784040	that have come from having the brain tumor. And one of them is that I have clarity as to what's
3784040	3794600	important in life and what's not. And I also, clarity. That's the thing I wanted to talk to
3794600	3800360	you about because we had, as I told you, we have seek up here, aneurysm survivor. He's got a time
3800360	3808920	bomb in his head as he, lately he talks about it. Like, what is that? What is, what is it that's
3808920	3815800	important about life? He said, spoilers, he said, give more than you take. That's, that's his take
3815800	3820200	away from the whole thing. Give more than you take from life. Is there anything you can add to that?
3820200	3826040	Sorry, I don't mean to. Well, you know, I, I, one of the things that I really felt lucky to be able
3826120	3833640	to experience was that I got to see all the love and light come in my way. And most people, when
3833640	3839320	they have their funeral, are not there to actually see that from other people or from God or from,
3839320	3847160	from so many, from everybody, you know, people thinking that you might die, neighbors, everybody
3847240	3859800	at work, my family. I felt like I, I remember thinking that, you know, I didn't really feel
3859800	3866760	bad for me. I felt bad. I was really, really quite worried about my husband and my 13 year old son
3866760	3873800	and my parents. So you felt like you were going to possibly die, right? Yes, at some point. And
3873800	3879160	you handled that in a way that, so in that moment, when you started, my concern was not for me,
3879160	3882440	you started to feel bad for all the people. Yeah, because I thought, you know, I'll be dead and I
3882440	3889960	won't know the difference. My concern was for all of my family and especially my immediate family
3889960	3895960	and even all my friends, because I knew there were some friends that very care very much for me. And
3895960	3902920	I, it gives a person the, and I got to see how everybody deals with their own mortality.
3903480	3912280	And some people were very open to kind of rush there to help or wanted to be there for me. Some
3912280	3916920	just kind of hold up in a room. And those were very good friends. And I never heard a word from
3916920	3921880	them. And I knew why I wasn't hearing from them. Yeah, they were scared. Yeah, I knew they were
3921880	3927400	scared to death. Before I met you, I might be one of those before I met seek. I'm very uncomfortable
3927400	3932760	with sickness and things like I haven't had loved ones, you know, it's like I needed to talk to
3932760	3938760	people that were cool with it. Yeah. And that's, you know, I knew that I had to reach out to them,
3939320	3943400	because I knew a lot of them thought, Oh, she's going to end up, you know, with a completely
3943400	3950200	different personality, and maybe have half of my wits gone, so to speak. And that would freak them
3950200	3959720	out, because it wouldn't be the person they knew. And so I knew I had to call everybody and let them
3959720	3969000	know that I was still me, that the best, you know, the best they knew was still was still here.
3972360	3979320	I was reaching out to other people. And then I think, and I also saw people that were,
3979960	3985960	I walked into this one restaurant. And I'm just going to tell the story, because it's, it's funny.
3985960	3994120	Dan, would you be quiet for one minute? Let her talk. It's funny how everybody deals with their
3994120	3998680	own mortality. And I had walked into this one restaurant, and I'm not going to name the name,
3998680	4003640	because I actually love, I actually love their pulled pork sandwiches a lot. So I'm not going
4003640	4007560	to mention their names. No, we go to little jobs all the time. We mentioned it, but there was a
4007560	4013560	woman in there. And I still go there. I still go there, despite what happened. I was in my, I walked
4013560	4021160	in there. And I had been in there before. And the lady, I know she recognizes me. And I had walked
4021160	4025880	in there with my walker. And of course, I had a scarf around my head. And I was probably bloated
4025880	4031880	because of all the medications that I was on. No, you look great. I remember those. I remember this.
4031880	4038840	Oh, I did everything. And I walked in, and I know she recognized me. And because, and she's seen
4038840	4046680	my husband before too. And I could tell she was clearly uncomfortable. And I asked her if I could
4046680	4052840	use the restroom. And I had done that before even one, before I even had this happen to me. And they
4052840	4058360	were fine. She was fine with me using the restroom before. And the restroom was in the back, behind
4058360	4065160	the counter. And I said, could I use your restroom? And I could tell she was freaked out by me. And
4065160	4072760	she says, well, it's not, she says, it's not open to the public. And I said, well, before I, she never
4072760	4078280	had a problem with me using it. And I said, well, I'm not, yeah. And I said, well, I'm not the public.
4078280	4084360	I'm a customer. So I want your customer restroom. And she said, and she kind of just freaked out.
4084440	4087640	And then she says, well, okay, but don't touch anything.
4090120	4093160	You asked to use this to regular ladies room at the restaurant or
4096440	4100120	it was a restroom that they have there that I've, you know, every time I had visited before they
4100120	4105240	didn't, she didn't have a problem. Okay. So I thought now because you seem like some sort of
4105240	4109560	damage. Yeah, well, I'm obviously damaged. I think she thought that she might catch what I had.
4109720	4116280	Oh, yeah. Yeah. So I thought to myself, you know, you get to see all different ways that people
4116280	4123240	deal with something as, you know, traumatic as this. Yeah. I mean, that's a huge thing. Like we
4123240	4129880	have as a TV writer and producer, like, you know, like, like 70s, Norman Lear, he's an activist,
4129880	4133880	he's going to make sure finally, black people and white people are going to like, we're going to use
4133880	4140120	the sitcom to overcome this thing. And like, now we're living in this maelstrom of like, what,
4140120	4144920	what did you say about gay people and bisexual people and transgender people? And we're, we're
4144920	4149960	getting through all this stuff. And, but still lingering. I think the biggest thing of all,
4149960	4155080	like the giant, the giant elephant in the room is like, somebody rolls into a room in a wheelchair
4155080	4160360	and it's like, I, you have an instinctive reaction. You wish that they weren't in a wheelchair.
4160360	4163480	Yeah. Well, how did they get that? And that's, that's completely different from,
4163480	4168360	from everything. It's interesting, especially because she knew me as kind of a vital person
4168360	4173480	beforehand. And then all of a sudden I walk in and I'm in a walker. She went home at night. She
4173480	4179400	would, there was a photo of you and God, this woman is so vital. Well, you know, it's funny.
4179400	4183000	Because when you walked in with a walker, she's like, my, my world is done. Well, you know,
4183000	4187160	I was so outraged and my husband said, well, what is your problem? And then I told him what she had
4187160	4190520	said. And he says, Oh, well, Jesus, we won't go there again. I said, no, we're going there.
4190520	4197000	I love those poor challenges. I mean, there had to be, but I bet, I bet, I bet if we had her up
4197000	4202600	here, you know what? And, and some weird story about when we went back afterwards, when I had,
4202600	4207880	you know, when he had healed and I was looking normal again, she just, she practically bent over
4207880	4217160	backwards to, to, yeah, that's the moral of story. Be normal. Uh, membership has its privileges.
4217880	4224520	Uh, thank, thank my neighbors, Beth and Dan boots. Thank you so much. We'll have them back
4224520	4232440	again. I, uh, I want to talk to Dan about his dad. We ran out of time, but I want to have Dan back
4232440	4240920	because Dan, Dan, Dan's dad was like this fucking, uh, I'll have him explain it. Honestly, like Dan's
4240920	4248040	dad was this original, uh, a hippie before being a hippie was cool. Uh, it was, I don't even know.
4248600	4251720	We'll interview him about it. It was very interesting. It's nice. Like after Beth,
4251720	4254600	you go through all that and Dan, you know, you, you watch your wife go through all this,
4254600	4258040	you know, trauma and stuff. And then you listen to your neighbor's podcast and he's talking to me,
4258040	4263320	calls your wife, the tumor lady. You know, it's like, it's nice, but I didn't, you know,
4267240	4275560	see your girl on cyber knife. Check it out Friday. I don't, uh, you know, I went, yeah, whatever.
4275560	4281480	Cyber knife. That's fucking wild. All right, Spencer, what do you want? What,
4282440	4287240	what do you mean? What do I want? Yeah. What do you want? I'd like to regale you guys with a
4287240	4294360	story that's almost as interesting as a tumor. No, I don't know. Spencer, do you think you know
4294360	4300680	how to take a compliment? I mean, I've learned since doing harm in town, how to take a compliment.
4300680	4303320	I think, I think you're a wonderful person. Thanks, ma'am.
4307560	4312600	When your delivery is so, so monotone, it's hard to say. It always sounds like, I mean,
4312600	4315880	I know that that wasn't sarcastic. Maybe I haven't learned how to take a compliment.
4316520	4322360	He's still, you got some, you got some defense mechanisms about you. Oh, all sorts. Like,
4322360	4327160	people say things to you out of deference and then, and then your, your, your
4327880	4333800	instinctive reaction is to go, yeah, fuck you. Yeah. You were saying earlier about how like,
4333800	4339320	when people are fishing for stuff, you shut down. I do that too. Like I, when people are trying to
4339320	4344680	like get a response out of me, I just can't. And I just like, no, fuck off. And like when I do
4344680	4348280	something funny or say something funny, and then someone's like, Hey, do the thing. I'm like,
4348280	4355320	fuck off. Go fuck yourself. What is that? It's spontaneity. And it's the spice of my brand of
4355320	4367880	comedy. Yeah, I agree. I thought people go like, do Sean Connery, do Sean Connery. I'm like,
4367880	4373400	no, fuck you. Yeah. It's like, no, at the time I nailed Sean Connery. Yeah, exactly. We were in
4373400	4382200	a submarine. Yeah, I do agree. But when people, does it infuriate you when, when you can sense
4382200	4386840	that someone is actually trying to get you to tell them that they're smart or pretty. Yeah. Because
4386840	4391640	so much of the time it's like, it's not like I don't like you. I'd be, I'd be willing to like,
4391640	4396120	you know, talk about how great you are, but just don't try and think you're you. That's the thing
4396120	4401560	is they think they're like going to outsmart you and they're, they're better than you. Yeah. Yeah.
4401560	4410120	Fuck them. Exactly. God damn it. Yes. God damn it. I love you so much. Yeah. Thank you for taking
4410120	4414840	that compliment. Yeah. They think they're, they think they're manipulating you. Well,
4414840	4419320	they, they're definitely trying. I'm enamored with other people. I'm enamored with them.
4419320	4424520	That's so when you give someone a compliment, do they burst into tears? I don't think so. Well,
4424520	4434040	they, I happens when I do it, you'll, you'll, you'll, you'll grow into it. Yeah. I just say,
4434040	4437800	like, like, like, you say, you say nice things to people that you really mean. Like, Hey,
4437800	4441880	you really, you know, you did a good job today. Good job. And it's meaningful because they're
4441880	4450600	not saying it all the time. Yeah. God damn it. Fucking insect parasites. See you fucking. How,
4450600	4455080	how many times, how many times a day or a week or a month do people come at you and fish your
4455080	4459640	compliments? Like how frequent is eight times a day? Really? Like, give me like an actual.
4459640	4464680	Dude, as often as it happens to you and it happens all the time, you call it conversation. Everyone
4464680	4468600	does it to each other. Everyone does it to each other. I mean, give me like a, give me a, for
4468600	4474120	instance, not, not my shirt, but somebody coming up to you and going like, uh, okay. So let's just
4474120	4482200	improv a conversation. Okay. Give me a suggestion. Anatoly, give me a, say a noun. Table. Okay.
4483640	4487240	Hey, uh, good job on this table. Thank you. Thank you for making the table.
4488600	4493240	You're welcome. I'm a, I'm a really good carpenter. Yeah. It's got four legs. It's
4493240	4497480	great. You did a good, good job on the varnish. Uh, thank you very much. I see. I mean, I tried,
4497480	4501400	I tried as hard as I could to put it in the right place. I don't really know what I'm doing when it
4501400	4510360	comes to tables. I don't know. Wait. Yeah, exactly. That does not happen to me eight times a day.
4514200	4520360	Like give me a real world thing. Nobody goes up and touch as awkward about the table. I made
4521240	4526840	people who are always like, I'm such an idiot. Like, like that. There are people, some, I know,
4526840	4531000	it's not everyone. Some people are honestly like, Oh, I'm so stupid. But some people are just like,
4531560	4536600	I'm such an idiot. You know, I went to the store. Here's what happens to me. Yeah. Here's what
4536600	4541400	happens to me all the time. Here's what happens to me constantly. Okay. Uh, you just finished
4541400	4550200	doing a show. Uh, and good night. Okay. I go into a, Hey, hey, uh, think, thank you. I enjoyed
4551000	4557880	you in the show. Oh, thank you very much. Thanks for coming. I'm an idiot and I don't, I don't,
4558840	4561880	I don't, I shouldn't, I shouldn't be talking to you right now. Yeah, you probably should.
4564760	4569720	No, I see. I mean, yeah, that's, that's the thing I get that. I think that your experience is not
4569720	4574920	the same experience for everybody because, uh, I think that like I, I noticed from you and my
4574920	4580280	friends that everybody attracts a certain kind of crazy. And like, uh, like when people are weird
4580280	4584440	to you and people like come at you at a party or after a show, maybe, or I've seen it a million
4584520	4590360	times, we've talked about this. People come to you to, for an affirmation that they don't come to
4590360	4594680	me for it. Like people want you to think they're smart. It's very important that people, when
4594680	4598680	people like are weird around you, what they're asking is like, I really need Dan Harmon to tell
4598680	4603560	me that I'm an intelligent, smart person. And like Rob Schwab, our friend, he's really creative.
4603560	4607560	People come to him and it can freak him out and bum him out, but they want, they need Rob to say
4607560	4611000	you're creative. And for me, it's always like the people, like they want me to tell them that
4611000	4616920	they're cool. What they like is cool. Like they want style, like, or what like, like coolness
4616920	4620680	points and stuff like that. But he said, we have very different kind of stuff. People come at you
4620680	4625560	and say, I'm an idiot. They don't, I don't get that kind of thing. People belittle themselves
4625560	4629400	because they need you to say, no, you're smart. You're this. And I've never in my life, I've never,
4629400	4635640	honestly, I've never said in response to somebody saying like, oh, I'm an idiot. I've never gone
4635640	4641160	like, no, you're great. Like, I just have never been able to do it. Yeah. Cause it would be so
4641160	4645000	strange. Just kind of silence. And then the, and then I feel like they go away and they go,
4645800	4650840	I said, it was an idiot. He didn't argue with me. Like, I don't know. I don't know if you're an
4650840	4654760	idiot. I don't know. But you have the power to make people feel like an idiot. Like, if like,
4654760	4660840	thank you, see, you see, that wasn't the compliment. That wasn't the compliment.
4665480	4670600	I just pointed at a guy. Yeah. But the thing is like that, that's a joke that might actually,
4670600	4674600	actually sting coming from you. Because like, like, I mean, I've known you for a long time. And if I'll
4674600	4683640	say, what are you doing? Fucking testing your zero. You're like Godzilla. Don't do it. You're
4683640	4692120	a fucking idiot. How dare you get out of bed today? What's your name? Austin. More like shit brain.
4693720	4699880	What the fuck were you thinking? Your parents were right. Your gym teacher was right. How
4699880	4711880	dare you try. Fuck you, Austin. You have a fucking smile.
4711880	4734120	You shall not pass! Tyler! Fuck you, Tyler! Fuck you, Tyler! Oh, fuck you! You do enjoy the power
4734120	4739560	that you wield to make somebody feel stupid. No, I don't. Yes, you do. No, I don't. Because it's
4739560	4743320	never got me anywhere. When you get cornered, I'm not saying that you profit, if any, from it,
4743320	4750840	but when you're bummed out and you want to even the score that you perceive is out of balance,
4750840	4755240	you are very, very deft and capable of making somebody feel like an absolute piece of shit,
4755240	4759640	like intellectually. And you can do it with a very small stroke. I don't profit from it, though.
4759640	4763240	No, no, you profit's none. It's not a profitable thing. Exactly. No, it's a curse. Yeah.
4764040	4769160	Oh, people look at my face and they think that my cheekbones, they think that I think that they're
4769160	4775640	stupid. I don't give a shit. That's the thing. That's the crazy thing. What do you mean?
4779880	4785320	How dare you? All right. Let's play Dungeons and Dragons. All right,
4785320	4790040	let's work these issues out. Aaron, will you join us again?
4793240	4804440	You okay, baby? I'm fine. Okay.
4805400	4810520	That was a weird entrance. You have a lot in your mind. You look like there's an issue of brewing.
4811880	4820920	No, it's all fine. Sounds not fine. No, it's all fine. Say it? No. Say it?
4821080	4829400	No, it's not worth it. It's not worth it. All right. No, we can't. We can't. Because then
4829400	4833160	if she says it, then she'll be able to go. You dragged it out of me. I'm trying to be a more
4833160	4839400	responsible person on stage. And we spent the entire time. See the way I said it? Yeah.
4842360	4846600	Okay, but let's just not talk about it. Let's just let it linger in the room like a weird,
4846680	4851320	weird. I don't think that Dan's being totally honest, by the way he feels. And we'll talk about
4851320	4856840	it later. And it's fine. But it's totally fine. No, it's not. See, exactly. Lock the doors.
4858680	4861480	Nobody leaves. No, what do you mean? What do you mean? What does that mean?
4862280	4866360	We should talk about that. What do you mean? Aaron, don't make us bring out. I mean,
4866360	4873000	our God. Are you being ostentatiously needy?
4876040	4881160	My favorite thing ever. A blog called me ostentatiously needy. I've never been happier.
4881880	4886520	What? Did you just say a black called you ostentatiously? A blog. No, I said a blog.
4888360	4892600	Let's talk about why you heard a black. What were you? What was I, I mean,
4892600	4897800	if I'm guilty of anything, it's a boring episode. It's about to get less boring.
4897800	4903320	Was I dishonest? I do think you were dishonest, but I, but maybe you were keeping your honesty
4903320	4907720	private. I don't know. What are you talking about? What do you mean? I mean, exactly.
4908360	4913640	God damn it. I can't keep any secrets. I'm a terrible person. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I,
4914440	4921400	ah, I mean, our friend who begs for compliments the most by being self-deprecating is Spencer.
4921400	4928360	Yeah. Who's okay. Yeah. All right. Spencer as my friend, it drives me crazy. I don't,
4928360	4933240	it's, it's fine. Whatever. I'm sorry. I definitely do it. What? I definitely do it.
4934120	4942440	Right. Okay. I'm like the worst. All right. Which is why we're friends.
4945720	4951160	Yeah, I know. Spencer's the worst about it. He's 23 years old. I also genuinely hate my
4951240	4955320	how he's the worst about it because you and I were literally talking about it on the way here.
4955320	4961320	I did. Oh, okay. All right. All right. Okay. All right. Okay. But in a very loving way,
4961320	4966280	because we both love Spencer so much, but we are literally saying how much we love Spencer and how
4966280	4971560	it annoys us. I didn't know dishonesty was defined by not saying everything that you talk about in
4971560	4975640	the car on the way to the show. You're right, which is why I should have said anything.
4976600	4982040	But okay. I was just honest, Spencer. I mentioned that. Yes, you deflect a lot of compliments.
4982040	4987080	Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like I've gotten better, but you know, fuck you.
4990040	4996120	You're the best dungeon master in the world. Okay. You see, I don't know. That's not even an
4996120	5002840	objective thing. Wait, wait. That Spencer, Spencer deflects so many compliments. That's a,
5002840	5008680	that's an issue. No, I fish for compliments for compliments all the time. No, I'm just
5008680	5013160	honestly self-deprecating. Okay. We'll see. That's what I was speaking to earlier. So there you go.
5014200	5018360	Why not talk about is being self-deprecating necessarily fishing for a compliment? No,
5018360	5023960	no, it's not, but it appears the same way in most contexts. Yeah.
5025960	5030920	Being self-deprecating is a way to kind of make, at least for me, it's been kind of a defense
5030920	5035480	mechanism too. If someone is being antagonistic and aggressive, I use self-deprecating as a tool.
5035480	5039720	Like, yeah, totally. I agree. You're right. As sort of a, sort of a defense mechanism. Sure. Which
5039720	5044280	is totally, which is totally true. But then there are also, but there, there's also like,
5044280	5048760	there are people who are in love who maybe have a lot of things about themselves that they don't
5048760	5055560	like. And we'll say that they don't like certain things about themselves, which is like a natural
5055560	5062760	thing. Do I look fat in these jeans? Being the classic. Being the classic, being the classic.
5062760	5068760	Like specifically people in love, you said? No, not specifically. I was doing a very bad joke.
5073800	5077880	No, there's no, everything's great. Did you see that this guy looks just like Johnny Pemberton
5077880	5083640	in the front row? Johnny Pembert too? Isn't that crazy? Kind of does. Yeah. There's no need to lash
5083640	5088520	out at people. That's not it. Oh, no. I think Johnny Pemberton's great looking. He does look
5088520	5092920	like, yeah, it does look like Johnny Pemberton. Yeah. No, no, no, it's fine. I think you guys
5092920	5097960	spent the whole, you spent the whole car right here just bashing Spencer. No, no, no, no, no.
5097960	5108200	I deserve it. I just thought it was ironic. No, not bashing him at all. We both are obsessed
5108200	5113160	with him. He works for dad. We both talk to him constantly. I love Spencer. Text him. I don't know
5113560	5120920	constantly. No, I will text you more. Talking to people constantly would be weird anyway,
5120920	5126360	but that would be weird. That would be weird. No, I, it's, it's, it's totally fine. It's frustrating
5126360	5129720	because we like you so much and it feels like you were, you were constantly putting yourself
5129720	5133640	down because it's not even a compliment thing. It's not when there's a compliment. It's, it's even
5133640	5140680	like I'm shitty at putting down a book and it's no, no one's shitty at putting that. He is shitty
5140680	5146200	at putting books down. Podcast listeners wouldn't know. Yeah. You go to his house,
5146200	5154440	there's books in the ceiling and shit. I say, I regret this entire thing, but I'm just saying
5154440	5160920	it's, it's comes from a very loving place. I love you, Spencer. I agree with everything you've been
5160920	5170840	saying. Well, except the loving me part. I, Spencer, I love you. Yeah.
5174280	5180840	You got a funny way of showing it car ride lady. No, we were literally whatever. It's fine.
5180840	5184200	I'm so sorry. Well, let's play a really uncomfortable Dungeons and Dragons.
5185160	5187560	Let's do it. Spencer, if you would.
5190200	5194040	Last time. Oh, good job. Harmon town.
5196040	5207080	Look what you did to him. I'll leave. Oh, no. No, come back. Yeah. That's what I always wanted.
5207640	5214840	I know it's, it's all fine. Everybody. Can you guys see my nightmare right now? Or is it just me?
5214840	5220120	I don't know why you're so uncomfortable. I'm fine. I'm sorry. Go, go, go. Anyway, last time
5220120	5226680	on Harmon town, our heroes had just felt an ogre in an icy Canyon. They led a skeleton army through
5226680	5232440	the gate towards the black keep the fortress of Admiral Darkstar. And as they marched up the icy
5232440	5237720	slope and climbed out of the Canyon, they saw that their skeletons had vanished. Before them
5237720	5242440	was a mighty army of darkness. And as our heroes charged forward at their foes, they plunged
5242440	5249480	through a trap floor or a trap door in the floor, sliding down into an icy dungeon, separated by
5249480	5254200	walls of ice and facing down doors. Quark melted through the icy barriers with his flaming swords,
5254200	5259960	reuniting the party. They checked the doors, treasure traps, gags and giant snowflakes ensued.
5259960	5264680	Using their new found treasure, they attacked, but none so much as Mulrain's whisper bow. And as
5264680	5270040	she whispered to said bow, it began to glow, firing off two arrows, destroying the snowflake
5270040	5275640	with massive damage. That sounds like that should, whatever. Thanks a lot, Aaron.
5277080	5283400	You fucked him up. You fucked him up for life. You broke Spencer. You broke him. The way out was
5283400	5288760	a staircase ahead. But Krista Berg and Mulrain were bleeding heavily from their jagged wounds
5288840	5296760	from the snowflake they encountered earlier. What would you do? Yay, Spencer!
5303560	5308600	Until such time as he does something wrong, I would like to invite Tyler up to play Krista
5308600	5317240	Berg. Tyler, welcome back. The crowd goes mild. That's the inappropriate reaction.
5317240	5323640	That was a tentative welcome to the stage from the audience. I'm terrible. I'm awful. D&D. Nobody
5323640	5327000	loves you. Yeah, that's what I've been thinking. There's one thing you can say about you. You're
5327000	5330600	good at D&D. You know what you're doing in the adventure. Especially for compliments.
5330600	5336280	You're a great edit. Oh, thanks. We all fish for compliments. You guys are doing great. Also,
5336280	5340520	I'm sorry. I want to just say I'm sorry. I know you were saying that the subreddit was like,
5340520	5345400	oh, Tyler's doing great up here. And I was sort of deflected it. And that was me doing that.
5345400	5349160	So I apologize. Who? Me? Yeah, yes, a couple weeks ago. Last week you were like, hey,
5349160	5352680	the subreddit seems to like you. And I was like, I don't know. And blah, blah, blah. So once again,
5352680	5356840	was terrible at 10K compliment. I apologize. We all do it. We all have blood on our hands.
5356840	5360600	In the most fun way, you complimented yourself in front of the audience. It was very fun.
5361400	5364520	That wasn't intentional. Maybe I'm not paying attention. I don't really feel like this is a
5364520	5370280	big issue in my life, this whole thing. No, no, no. I don't see why you guys are so bent out of shape
5370280	5376600	about this stuff. It doesn't torture me that people diminish themselves. You don't constantly
5376600	5382040	have people coming up to you and saying, I guess you don't think I dress that good. It happens
5382040	5387720	once in a while. So you think I'm underdressed. And I go, yeah, fucking dress up. Fucking make
5387720	5392200	an effort, cocksucker. It's Friday night. You have sandals on. Fucking pull it together.
5392200	5397160	Okay. Well, the rest of us have a problem with that. No, people want to lower themselves
5397160	5401160	beneath me. I'll do everything I can. I'll do everything I can to lift them back up.
5402680	5405240	No, you need to stand your ground and be their Adonis, okay?
5406360	5412200	I'm just saying, I feel like I'm not tortured by people are constantly, every time somebody does
5412200	5416440	something self-deprecating, I don't feel like they're trying to pick my pockets. I think you
5416440	5420120	think that they're trying to do, that they're trying to hoodwink you or outsmart you into
5420120	5426600	saying something. But in that moment, for real, facetiousness aside, you do what?
5426680	5430040	Do you give them what they want to hear? Do you tell them to go fuck themselves? Jeff,
5430040	5433640	you probably think that I'm an asshole because I'm dressed this way, right? Because I'm not
5433640	5441000	wearing a suit. What are you talking about, man? People will come up and go like,
5441880	5446440	I guess I'm underdressed. And I'll go like, yeah. That's a joke. I'll make a joke out of it.
5446440	5451320	That's what I want to do. It's a deflection thing. But some people will just be self-deprecating as
5451320	5456440	a nature. That's what I do sometimes. You go into a perceived crowd of people who
5456440	5461880	are cooler, ex, slash more popular, whatever, than you. And you just have to go in and assume,
5461880	5467880	yeah, they know that I am bad. So I make self-deprecating things to put myself on their level.
5467880	5471960	It's not even a thing that I consciously do. Sometimes in conversation, it happens.
5472520	5476440	Yeah. I think people's natural instinct is to come in low, especially to strangers or people
5476440	5482280	that they may be, if you're a fan of a comedy podcast and you meet somebody, or people that
5482360	5489080	know Spencer from now, your mild notoriety from this, people are going to come in and act weird.
5489080	5493240	I think that's just a natural human thing. And also, I find it sort of a tactic to be
5493880	5497720	disarming. It's sort of like, I'm not coming at you like, look how amazing I am. I'm awesome.
5497720	5501720	I'm cool. I'm like, whatever. I'm human. Look at this. I'm kind of kidding. We're cool, right?
5503640	5508040	It certainly happens. You're saying it happens to you so much that it's a real
5508040	5512360	problem for you. I don't sense that in my life. I'm not even saying it happens so much as a
5512360	5515640	problem. I'm saying it is a thing. Am I alone in that? Is there anyone else that can relate to me
5515640	5520680	on that? Okay. I feel like I was crazy up here for like that. You know how when you're in an
5520680	5525000	office chair and you're like, it's got rollers on the bottom, and you're at linoleum, and then
5525000	5529880	you're going into a carpeted area, and there's like a little thing. In a conversation where that
5529880	5535720	happens, my roly chair can't. It won't roll past that. And someone goes like, I guess you think
5535720	5540440	I'm an idiot because I'm a stupid idiot. It's different. I guess you think I'm a stupid idiot.
5545640	5549480	I don't know if you're a stupid idiot. I don't know. That's certainly a bad conversation. That's
5549480	5553480	not a fun conversation to be in. It's a different thing for Dan because people look up to you.
5553480	5558600	Oh, God. This is the worst episode of the worst podcast in the world. No, I'm so sorry. I'm so
5558600	5563000	sorry, America. I'm so sorry. No, we love it, Dan. It's amazing. Can we make this lost episode number
5563000	5570360	two? The first one was when I found out I was going back to the community. I was just a social
5570360	5575400	phenomenon. I thought it happened to everybody. Somebody goes like, I know I'm so fat. I'm so fat.
5575400	5579800	I'm so fat. It doesn't matter if you think they're fat or thin or whatever. It's just like this sand
5579800	5586520	bag drops on you. I think it is a social phenomenon that people just react to differently. It may be
5586520	5590600	more of an impediment for you, but I guess for a lot of people I know, it's just something that,
5590600	5595800	I don't know whether it's being in LA and just sort of these people act like that. They try to
5595800	5600760	find the most disarming way to get into a conversation. So that oftentimes is a conversation
5600760	5605960	starter for them. Dan, are you able to sort out when somebody is trying to get something from you
5605960	5611000	and when somebody is just expressing how they feel about themselves? Yes. Okay. All right.
5614360	5619160	Yeah. Thanks for coming to Harman Town. Krista Berg and Mulrain take four bleeding
5619240	5627160	damage from cashes in their stomachs. All right. So we're walking up the staircase right now.
5627160	5635720	And bleeding. Help, help me. Yeah. I heal everybody. How do you do that? With my healing ring.
5636440	5645160	I don't think that exists. You tried. I have no healing powers. Does anyone know healing
5645160	5650120	first aid? I know healing. I have healing powers. Am I able to heal myself? You can try and
5650120	5655480	bandage your wounds. Okay. Bandage my wounds. Oh shit. I forgot. Dice. I mean, I didn't forget
5655480	5659560	them. They're right here, but I forgot to get them out. I hope there's no mistaking how much
5659560	5664600	I love Spencer. I really don't think loving Spencer. It sounds like you spent some time
5664600	5668760	loving him, some time despising everything he does. No, no, not Jeff. Come on. You know,
5668760	5672200	that's not true. Yeah. Look at that smile. I wish on the podcast you could see that little,
5673000	5677480	that little cracker Jack, Jeff, smile. Aaron, Aaron, what are we best friends? You're a cracker
5677480	5682440	Jack. Aaron, you're not being totally honest right now. You came over to my place yesterday
5682440	5689080	and spent four hours just shit talking. Spencer. We got a dispenser slumber party and we put on
5689080	5697960	beards and we're like, Oh, you can't see my face. And then you tried to make out with me, which is
5698280	5703160	what is that about? Oh, I can't blame a guy for trying. What's the point of having a Spencer
5703160	5711400	slumber party if I can't make my moves? Spencer slumber party. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. All right. So do
5711400	5715480	we heal these people or what? Well, you bandage your wounds and manage to staunch the bleeding.
5717160	5725320	Hey, can you help me? I'm in a bad sitch here. I try to heal them with bandages. Okay. Are you
5725640	5730920	good at it? Do that. Okay. See, we're good. Okay. We're good. All right. Let's make something
5730920	5736600	happen out of this. Let's do it. All right. So we walk up the stairs at the top of the stairs.
5736600	5741960	There's a brilliantly ornate door as hard as I can. I didn't even, I didn't even get a chance
5741960	5747080	to hear what it was. What are you blaming? It's a thing being kicked. All right. As you kick the
5747080	5754120	icy door, you feel your foot stick to the door. Shit. Frost creeps up your leg as it freezes.
5755880	5762440	Fuck it. I use my flaming armor to unfreeze him. All right. He takes three ice damage before
5762440	5769000	flying out. Fuck door. Dan, stop blindly caking stuff. What are you doing? Just an aggressive
5769000	5775080	mood. I know. Is there a latch or a handle on this door? There's handles.
5777240	5780440	But you don't want to touch him probably because you'll get ice damage. I mean, who knows, man.
5781400	5787320	Can I use my armlet of winter to calm the ice? Do I have power over ice and snow?
5787320	5791960	Not over a door made of ice. You have a power over like weather snow, but not like if there
5791960	5796280	was an ice cube, you couldn't be all like, hey, fucker, do something. I just realized,
5796280	5800840	I think I always say, who knows, man, when someone asked me a question that they're right about.
5803320	5807160	I haven't noticed that. Oh, Spencer. Aaron, let it go.
5807160	5813160	Let it go. Let it go. Let it go.
5820760	5822680	Guys, I was bullied for my perfect skin and hair.
5825080	5832440	So lay off. I strike the door with my flaming sword. It melts. My sword or the door? The door.
5832440	5837000	My sword or the door? A valid question. Yeah.
5839400	5844280	Inside the door, you can see a room composed of finely worked stone slabs,
5844280	5847480	which are incredibly even, smooth. They kick all of them.
5851080	5854120	Your foot kind of skids off them. It's really slippery floor.
5854840	5858040	Tan, you're going to trip and hurt yourself. Buddy, talk to us. What's happening?
5858040	5862680	Don't fish for compliments. I'm not fishing. I didn't say I'm terrible. Talk to me.
5863480	5873080	Gay people are fine. Okay. I agree. Wait, what? What are the stone slabs? Describe these?
5873080	5878520	Oh, I was describing. The room is freezing cold. And on the far side of the room,
5878520	5883480	you can see a massive purple beast looking like a massive porcupine with great orange
5883480	5888600	and purple spines on its back and glowing green eyes. It's standing in front of a long
5888600	5892680	copper pendulum sort of thing that hangs down from a hole in the ceiling.
5892680	5897720	I run up and before he says anything, I say, I just want you to know that is a great copper pendulum.
5898760	5902600	I don't know if it's yours. You say this to the porcupine beast.
5905160	5910440	Every single demon we've tried to talk to just like they light on fire or their eyes get real
5910440	5914920	big. I don't like to condescending to me. He's not condescending. He's just giving you a note.
5914920	5920440	I'm saying I'm trying to be real here. I'm not saying I'm not going. Maybe you shouldn't do this.
5920440	5925000	I'm not using the lilting tone of voice. I'm saying these demons, every time we've run up
5925000	5931160	and talked to them, they're in bad moods. They have had the worst days. You're right.
5931160	5935720	You're right. And yet I keep on trying to find a demon who's going to relate to me emotionally.
5936600	5939800	I want that too, but that seems like self-destructive behavior.
5940360	5946200	You're right. I walk out of the door. I walk out. No, wait, no. No, you don't.
5947800	5950200	I thought you were being like Kate Hudson in the first act of it.
5951720	5957400	No, don't go. Don't drop your papers. I go in the corner and I feel ashamed
5958200	5964520	because I guess I made the wrong action when I sit down and I start pulling the hair out of my
5965240	5969240	hair. What does this become the most passive aggressive hunky shit in the world? No, no,
5969240	5974600	listen, I can anyone speak in a direct active sentence and just say what they want. The pork
5974600	5984280	you demon attacks. Good. Good. Good. I'm just saying love can't bloom. All right.
5984280	5990600	Krista Berg and Mulrain get hit by flying spines. Great. I opened my eye. I'm hoping to catch one
5990600	5999080	in my eye. You don't. Damn. Krista Berg takes five damage and Mulrain takes one. Sorry. Hey,
6000120	6006840	I was trying to help. I know. Fucking nobody likes anybody. Friends like these. On the wall
6006840	6011720	behind the porky demon, you see a large orange colored door and on either side of the door,
6011720	6017480	three large stone slabs, each standing out of the wall like they're, uh, you know, hanging out.
6018440	6025480	They jet past the wall. I slammed my head against the orange door. Okay. Wait. No,
6025480	6031720	you're on the other side of the room. Okay. I don't do it. Okay. I'm so, I'm so confused
6031720	6035960	with what's going on right now. Yeah. Usually I describe a whole room and then you have some
6035960	6041880	idea of what it looks like. How big is this room? How big is this room? I mean, it's, it's about 30
6041960	6047800	by 40. Okay. Long style long. Okay. So the porcupine and the pendulum are on the other end of the room.
6047800	6053640	Yeah. There's like a series of stone. Yeah. Stone. They look like large circular stone buttons now
6053640	6058440	that I mentioned it. And then where there's also a door behind them or to one of them. Yeah. They're
6058440	6064280	between, they're behind, they're directly behind the pendulum. Okay. But we got to get past this
6064280	6072760	porcupine thing probably. All right. I, I, I, uh, I go fucking wild. I go to a, uh, I do a power
6072760	6076920	attack on this, uh, with my, uh, with my mighty sword, my new mighty sword that I just found.
6076920	6082360	All right. Your power attack misses. You go wide. Power attacks are a lot more wild and
6082360	6088200	less accurate. And that's what happens. Right. This seems to sound a little defensive. What?
6089160	6094680	Oh my gosh. Family therapy. Putting it at Christopher's turn. So his attack missed,
6094680	6101560	you know. Okay. Uh, I would like to use my amulet of autumn to go invisible and see if I can maybe
6101560	6106120	find a weak point on this giant pointy guy. Does this say how many times you can go twice a day?
6106120	6110360	Okay. It's been the same. We're still in the same day, right? Yeah. No, we're good. We're good.
6110360	6114520	Yeah. So I'd like to go invisible to see if I can scout around it and maybe find a weak spot. I mean,
6114520	6122520	I'm assuming it's just little head forever spikes. Yep. Fuck. Fuck. Okay. We got to hit his head.
6122520	6126920	You got to get his head. Um, is that your whole action or can you, can you, can you fish in for
6126920	6136040	a weakness? I don't know. He's so big. He's got so many spikes, but wait. No, I'm kidding. Uh,
6136040	6140840	okay. Let me see if I can, uh, uh, okay. So this, we didn't have time to identify this dagger with
6140920	6146120	this stupid ribbon on it. So I'm just going to take my poison dagger and stab him in the face
6146120	6154040	out of stealth. Nice. Take that poison dagger. All right. That happens and you stab him in the face.
6155960	6167000	Awesome. Dealing 16 damage. Did you add the one detail? I mean, 23 damage, 23, 23.
6167000	6176200	Damn. Nice. Good job. Putting it up on range turn. Can I, can I really quickly do an impression
6176200	6182680	of a Spencer after he finishes making love to a woman? That happens.
6187800	6193640	That's not a picture. Can I do an impression of that? I'm going to go cry.
6194600	6199480	Will I see you again? And you go, who knows, man?
6203080	6211720	Also explaining. Uh, so you got a new bow last week. Um, I know. And if you talk, and if you
6211720	6219080	talk, and if you talk Elvish to it, it gets crazy. All right. I just figured I'd mention it. Okay.
6219160	6224440	Well, I feel obligated. I guess I use the whisper bow. I'm not trying to tell you how to play.
6225560	6231080	I know. You know, Tyler, I'm doing, I'm doing a bad bit and I don't mean it. I think you're
6231080	6235320	doing a really good job. I appreciate how much you care about the show. Thank you. I thought I
6235320	6240440	was doing terrible. No, you're doing a very good job. And I think that everyone really appreciates
6240440	6245960	how much you, how thoughtful you are. I'm going to start chanting in a second. And I think there's
6245960	6250520	been a number of people that will join in that too many layers here. So I don't mean that I'm
6250520	6257640	sorry. I use my whisper bow. Okay. To shoot. I mean, how do you use it? Do you have to whisper
6257640	6260520	when you're using it? Talk Elvis to it, I guess. Yeah.
6265720	6273000	Is Elvis Scott, you notice that the bow doesn't glow like it did that one time.
6276040	6285000	Zildren scooben botan. David Lee Roth. 11. Still nothing.
6287880	6292760	I tried, did I use, did I speak Elvis? You definitely spoke it. Thanks, Spencer.
6293720	6303000	Okay. Authentic 1920s, verlum, Elvis.
6305960	6311080	Do you want to do anything else? I'd like to fire, I'd like to fire 14 arrows.
6312760	6318840	How about one arrow? All right, I'll take one. Okay, good. I fire one arrow. It hits dealing.
6319480	6327000	I rolled the dice earlier. It got an 18 plus is 25, which hits people that think I'm cheating.
6327000	6334280	No one thinks I'm cheating. People are looking at my dice or making sure I'm rolling. Otherwise,
6334280	6341480	they're like, this is just a farce. I guess it is a farce anyway. Spencer,
6341480	6344360	they're actually people who reach out to you and they're like, I don't think he's actually
6344360	6349720	rolling dice. I think he's just saying that. Yeah, guys, it's terrible. If I could, of course,
6349720	6353560	reverse engineering the theory that you're cheating from the end result, which is
6354760	6361880	nothing this entertaining could be done organically. There's no way. Can I just go
6361880	6366360	on the record to say I think all of you suck right now. You will get no compliments out of
6366360	6370680	me right now. I think you guys are all being a bunch of turkeys. Yeah, you're terrible.
6370680	6375240	I've done a terrible podcast. I know, I absolutely agree with you. You're fucking doing it wrong.
6375240	6384840	Fine. I kill myself. I take an arrow, I swallow an arrow. Tear up the sheet. Tear up the sheet.
6385560	6389480	That's how you kill yourself. Well, thanks Adam for being so enthusiastic. I keep kicking
6389480	6394360	everything and punching everything. The enemies are just the surrounding walls.
6394360	6398840	Kick the porcupine. If you're going to kick something, kick him in his dumb eyeballs.
6399480	6404840	Or the teeth. Does he have teeth? Do porcupines have teeth? This one does. Okay.
6406200	6412040	It's more of a porcupine demon, really. Do you want me to go? On your turn? Yeah.
6412040	6415640	Yeah, but you didn't specify what you were punching and kicking.
6416600	6422680	You tell me when I get to go. It's your turn. All right, I cast a spell. What is happening? Okay.
6427000	6428360	Scorching ray. Oh, okay.
6430360	6434600	There's a bunch of weenies. Hey, don't let me into the weenie room.
6434600	6439960	Huh? I attacked and I missed. I'm waiting my turn patiently while you try to talk to a porcupine.
6439960	6444600	You fire a scorching ray and it deals 17 damage. Yeah.
6447320	6453400	Way to go Sharpie. You did good. I bet my neighbors are real glad they came to the show tonight.
6457000	6459640	What's going on? I don't know, Beth. I don't know.
6460600	6462920	Isn't this the guy that called our party boring?
6462920	6470680	Yeah, yeah. You respond by giving up the shittiest show you've ever done.
6476040	6478760	She survived a tumor and she had to deal with this too. Yeah, exactly.
6480200	6483480	She survived a tumor and then I came on stage and like, uh, tumor lady.
6485240	6490840	Then she comes up, dad, she's a tumor lady. And then sit down, sit down, tumor lady. Let me show
6490840	6502840	you what, what's what. Uh, 30 feet of rope. And she's like, I have a tumor sized hole in my brain,
6502840	6509160	but I know this is boring. I know. They didn't, they didn't take out the part that makes me know
6509160	6513720	what's exciting. I don't think it's boring, Dan. Thank you, Tyler.
6513720	6520680	You're welcome. I'm sorry I fished for that.
6523480	6526680	You're fucking, you were trawling with a big net on that one, man.
6527960	6531480	You caught 18 million tuna in a boot and I cut your tires.
6535400	6542120	I'm so sorry. I just realized my big pet bee was people fishing for compliments. That's my whole
6542200	6553960	life. I'm the last person to realize I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I just caught up. I just caught up.
6553960	6555880	Thank you for coming to Harvard town tonight, everybody.
6558920	6562600	Let's end the madness right here. Tyler, thank you so much for playing with us, sir.
6563480	6567800	Thank you, Beth and Dan boots. And thank you for that lovely story. Thank you. Thank you.
6568520	6574360	I love you. I'm Jeff Davis. One more time for your mayor, Dan Harmon.
6575240	6580360	Tell him you love him. Tell him you love him, everybody, won't you? Thank you,
6580360	6585720	Lizette. Thank you, Dan and Beth boots and for coming up with your humanity. Thank you,
6585720	6587800	Johnny. Johnny Pemberton. Thank you, sir.
6590360	6593000	We love you. We mean it. And you didn't even have to fish for that. You guys,
6593000	6603560	you're a good audience, no matter what.
6612120	6614360	Please hold while your call is being transferred.
6616040	6618200	I have no clue. I was born in 89.
6618200	6621720	Simulacrum means happy Kim trail day. Yes. That was nice.
6622440	6626200	Johnny, hold that thought. I can't tell you that over the phone. Do you want to get struck by
6626200	6634680	lightning? Twisting the wind with Johnny Pemberton on Feral audio. Yeah. What are you doing? Are you
6634680	6642520	going to check it out? That was pretty good. That was pretty good. Like a little quick one.
6642520	6647320	Yeah. That's what we call it. A turn of phrase. I believe that's what they used to call it.
6655400	6659480	Thank you for calling. Steve, could I have your last name and your zip codes or
6659480	6665640	and pull up your order? Yep. Last name is tip corn zip codes nine double zero.
6667560	6671000	I just made a call by they say I had to call back because he was about to head.
6671000	6678120	He had to go. He had to head out. But I had some questions about the product before I continued.
6679240	6684600	Okay. Before you, before you ordered it. Yeah. Okay. What's your question? Well,
6684600	6688120	I just only caught a glimpse of it on TV. I just saw like the last,
6688120	6692520	maybe 10 seconds of it. And I'm just trying to get a better understanding of what it was.
6692520	6697400	So these are like special glasses that you can adjust the prescription on them to be whatever
6697400	6702600	you want. So you don't have to ever get new glasses. Is that the idea? Nope. Nope. This is
6703480	6709800	for you to go outside if you want to try to see birds in a tree. Okay. If you want to go to a
6709800	6717560	game where you can zoom in, see people at the game so you're not so far away. It's not for quote,
6717560	6721640	reading glasses. Okay. Well, I don't do it when you're reading. I just do more like looking for
6722600	6728120	birds and lizards and stuff and, uh, driving, you know, like what I was looking for is something
6728120	6732600	I can wear while I'm driving and I can look for birds. Nope. You can't use these while you're
6732600	6737560	driving. You got to remember when you, when you look into these things, everything's going to be
6737560	6743320	magnified to you. Okay. As it comes closer to you, it's going to totally blur up. Okay. So wouldn't
6743320	6747080	that be good then? Cause you can see stuff from far away and you can break and ahead of time.
6747720	6752920	Nope. Nope. No, it's, it's going to be totally blurry. Think of it this way. If you, if you're
6752920	6759800	have regular binoculars on and, and, and if you're going like 30 miles an hour, you're catching up
6759800	6764760	to that thing right away, the stuff is close to you. You can't see. Well, but you will, you will
6764760	6770440	have seen it before you got to where it was, where it is. Then when you get, I know, but I know,
6770440	6776440	but when you, when you break, you're going to break too early or way too late. Well, it's better to
6776440	6783000	break too early, isn't it? That's what they say. Don't be sorry. Be ready. I know, but think of
6783000	6788600	the people behind you. You're, you're going along. You, you break. They don't see anything in front
6788600	6794120	of you. They're going to smack you in the rear. Oh, well, I don't know who drives like that,
6794120	6800120	because you can't see around a car. Oh, so I know I always look beyond the car ahead of me.
6800120	6804920	Oh, so if you, so if a person's breaking and they, and so if you're driving behind somebody and that
6804920	6808600	person in front of you breaks, but you don't see what they're breaking for, you just hit them.
6809720	6814920	Correct. Yeah. That's why, that's why you never drive close, but I always look beyond the car
6814920	6820600	in front of me. And so what happens when you rear end them when, then when they, I never have,
6820600	6825800	I never have. Oh, but given the circumstance, you would choose to rear end them because you'd be
6825800	6830520	like, why are they stopping? I'm going to show them what floor, why not to stop. Is it like that?
6831400	6836280	Quite correct. But, but you don't wear these driving. What about video games?
6837320	6846120	Video games. You have a giant TV or something, right? You could play far away. People have here
6846120	6852360	used these glasses while working here on the computer screen. That's cool. So I suppose you
6852360	6858600	can use them via a video game. That's a great idea. Yeah. Do you, where are y'all working at?
6859560	6863400	We're in Connecticut. Oh, Connecticut. I've been there once. It's really pretty there.
6863400	6868280	It's probably pretty hot there right now, isn't it? It's in the eighties and nineties. Yeah. Eighties
6868280	6871960	and nineties. Well, I would say it's pretty hot. You know, I don't know. Do you consider that hot
6871960	6876680	or do you say that's not hot? No, that's not hot. What do you consider hot? Are you from like the
6876680	6884280	desert? Nope. Hot is in the high nineties, hundreds. Oh wow. Okay. So what do you consider this to be?
6884280	6890600	Just like, like fun or like warm? It's not hot. It's not hot. It's double warm. How about double
6890600	6896040	warm? No, double warm. It's just over a hundred. That's it. Oh, so what would you consider this
6896040	6899720	temperature to be then? Cause I'm in the same temperature shredder that you just mentioned.
6899720	6903880	I'm in that and I could say it's hot, but I don't know. Maybe I should not use that word.
6903880	6910760	I should say something else. Where are you at in Arizona? We're near there. Yep. Yeah. That's not
6910760	6915320	hot. That's dry heat. That's totally different. Okay. What do you mean? I don't understand.
6916520	6922760	Dry heat is totally different than regular hot and humid. How so? Hot and humid. You will die.
6923800	6931320	If you were to go to a hot and humid, you would think it's about 130 130. Oh yeah. Easy. That's
6931320	6939320	like a miniature oven or something. Oh yeah. I know. Oh yeah. Yeah. If you, if you ever go down to,
6940120	6947560	if you go down to where water is totally around you. Okay. Like an island. Correct. Okay. And it
6947560	6952920	gets to be hot. Uh-huh. You will, you will die because it's, it's so hot and humid where you
6952920	6956600	guys are. You don't have that much humidity. I have a question. Couldn't you just get in that
6956600	6962040	water and cool down? Well you, you can, but, but you do, but a lot of people who are not used to it
6962040	6966120	die. Cause they don't know how to swim or cause they just don't know they can get in the water.
6966760	6969560	They just don't know how to cool off. A lot of people don't like the water.
6969560	6974360	Like they're like dogs or something. Cause dogs do that when dogs can't get in the water. Cause
6974360	6978520	they don't know it's water. They just think it's for drinking and then they try to drink with all
6978520	6983640	and then they just die. Yeah. Yeah. But all, all dogs know how to swim because they dog paddle.
6983640	6988760	Oh, are you serious? Wait, would you say that again? All dogs know how to swim cause they
6988760	6993080	dog paddle. What does that mean? They have like a special like motor or something in them? I don't
6993080	6999000	know. No, no, no. If you watch a dog go into water, they start moving their feet all the time.
6999000	7004040	It's called dog paddle. That's why they tell, tell you when you learn how to swim, dog paddle.
7004040	7009320	Okay. That's where that comes from. So you just dog paddle. So the best thing to do on a hot day
7009320	7015480	is to get down by that water where it's super hot and get in and dog paddle. So you're telling me
7015480	7023160	it's 130 degrees there. No, no, it can't, it can be. It can be. Well, you know, or it feels like it.
7023160	7029960	It feels like 130. Well, when it gets to be a hundred near water, you know, you know, near a
7029960	7035320	hundred, it's going to be hot and humid. You're, because you're from Arizona, you're going to
7035320	7041720	think it's much hotter. Oh yeah. It's not because it's now humid and humid ads, you know, because
7041720	7047960	I got to be humid up here. Temperature was like 91 humidity with the humidity was up to 99%.
7048760	7055960	Oh, that's like a rain in the air. Correct. Yep. So basically surrounded by air. So this is about
7055960	7062120	understand. Okay. Humidity is 99%. It's 90 degrees. It makes it feel like it's 130 because the water
7062120	7068120	is around you. But how come when you get into water, like a pool, which is a thousand percent
7068120	7074120	water, right? Can we agree on that? A thousand percent water. How come that cools you down? Is
7074120	7079080	it because it's so much water? No, it's just because the water is on your skin. It doesn't
7079080	7084280	really cool you down. It's cool in the outside of your skin. What about convection oven? Do you
7084280	7089720	know about that? No, don't know anything about that. Okay. I heard a convection oven on the news.
7090360	7097320	They said when it does a, uh, instead of raining, if it does wind, which wind is like rain, but it's
7097880	7103480	not water. It's just like air. When it does that from above, because there's just hot clouds up
7103480	7108840	there that they have, we have these hot clouds. They come over and you think it's going to be
7108840	7114280	a lot cooler because the sun is going hiding, but actually it's a hot cloud and it does a,
7114280	7120600	uh, does a, a wind from the top and it does a, they call it a convection oven because what it
7120600	7128040	does is it blows heat like, um, like a hair dryer, like it's been plugged in, like a plugged in hair
7128040	7137880	dryer. And that will cause, um, if you don't have to use the dryer. Right. Yeah. So what you're saying
7137880	7145000	is you guys out there, you can't hang your clothes up. Oh no, you can. You can. That will dry. That's
7145000	7152440	totally different. Well, you said it's 99%. Yeah. What about if it's a thousand? Okay. You, you,
7152440	7156440	you can put it outside the heat from the sun is going to dry, dry your clothes in the sun. What
7156440	7162680	about if it's like a nine, I'd like 900% humidity? It doesn't matter. It's going to be more damp on
7162680	7166680	your clothes. It's not going to be super dry. It's going to take longer to dry it. It's all it's
7166680	7170920	going to be. What's the highest percent you can get before it's, it's wet. A hundred percent,
7171000	7176120	a hundred percent is total rain. Well, no, a thousand percent. No, a hundred percent. Well,
7176120	7180120	you can't go a thousand percent. Well, you can, yes, you can. Cause there's that's the number
7180120	7185400	percentage. It is. That's the highest number per thousand. No, no, no. You can't go over a hundred
7185400	7191320	percent. Go, go ahead and watch all the, all the news. Uh, it goes up to a hundred percent. It's
7191320	7195720	pure rain. You know, when they go ahead and say it's 80% chance of rain, they'll never go above
7195720	7202120	a hundred percent. I swear I saw once they said, uh, 500% chance of rain and it was, yeah. And it
7202120	7207320	was definitely rained the next day. Very hard. I think that's probably, you know, I think that's
7207320	7211480	probably a thing that's different where I live and where you live. Cause the here, the rain is
7211480	7216280	different, more doesn't happen as much. So when it does happen, they say, Hey, look, you really got
7216280	7221640	to look out for the rain. It's going to be a 500% rain, not just an 80%. Cause people around here,
7221640	7226920	like they don't believe it cause people here are stupid so they don't get it. Yeah. That's interesting.
7226920	7232360	Well, well then how come those glasses, how come the zoomers, they, um, they say like magnifies
7233160	7241400	300% 300% what you can see with the naked eye. So 300%. So that's a, that's a percent
7241400	7247400	that I thought it can't go over a hundred though. No, that's different. Okay. I don't understand.
7247400	7257080	That is, uh, if you can see good at, uh, 40 feet, uh, you know, 40 yards, 300% in is you, you
7257080	7263000	they're much closer to you. So it's like being on a horse. It's like if you rode on a horse toward
7263000	7268040	the item that you're looking at, but didn't ride on it. Correct. Okay. So is it, is it have like a
7268040	7273960	stabilizer? So if you're on a horse, you can still look at it. No stabilizer. Okay. Cause I would
7273960	7278520	want to, I would want to use them with a horse because that's the best way to get toward birds
7278520	7284440	because the horses don't scare birds like a car does. Correct. Same with lizards. Lizards don't
7284440	7289960	mind horses. Did you know that? Correct. Yeah. That's weird. I don't know. For some reason,
7289960	7296120	lizards are not bothered by horses. Um, but they are bothered by dogs. I tried to do, I have a very
7296120	7302440	large dog. It's a double St. Bernard. It's like a St. Bernard, but it's brewed, brewed in Russia
7302440	7306840	and it's very large and you can ride it. You know, it doesn't like to be ridden, but you can ride it
7306840	7312200	and it will allow you to get super close to the lizards to take their pictures. But you, you think
7312200	7317640	so, but it scares them away. So I got a horse instead and the horses just don't, I think the
7317640	7322760	horses and lizards are friends because they're both, um, the same, the same family or something.
7322760	7329400	So they don't scare them. And so I will be riding the horse toward the lizards and the birds.
7330360	7338040	And that's why I need a shock absorber. But those don't have them, huh? Nope. So they do not have them.
7338040	7341880	Okay. But you could mount anything onto there, right? Like once I get them, I can do whatever
7341880	7348040	I want to them. Correct. So you can't drive with them, but you can ride a horse. No problem.
7349160	7355000	Correct. Okay. Right. Is that because the horses, they are more friendly and stuff like toward a
7355000	7360680	lizard. No, no, no, it's, uh, it's, it just said on spook. That's all it is. Oh, it's a spook. Right.
7360680	7366680	Okay. Yeah. Because like you were saying, if you, cause a horse, if you're going to stop early,
7366680	7373240	cause you've got your zoomies, you can see far, you see that lizard far ahead or maybe a spider
7373240	7378360	and you stop the person behind you on a horse will, their horse knows that you stopped and you don't,
7378360	7383000	they don't have to hit the brakes, right? Correct. Yeah. See that's what I think I'm going to try
7383000	7388200	this out now when I do the car drive is when I, someone ahead of me breaks for no reason. And I
7388200	7394520	don't see anything. I don't see like a wall or a stop sign or like a person or like a child. I'm
7394520	7399400	just going to keep, just hit, give them a little tap because that way you can collect insurance
7399400	7405880	because they, they are at fault for stopping. Yeah. Yep. I have a friend who did that actually,
7405880	7412680	who made, he's made all of his money doing that just by what he does. He drives around real fast
7412680	7419000	and he just, if somebody does the wrong move in traffic, he just lets them know. He teaches them,
7419560	7422760	you know, you have, sometimes you have to teach people the hard way and that's just, you have to
7422760	7428840	hit them. Yep. And, but that's, you know, cars are made for that. So we all know which way we're
7428840	7437640	going to go. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And so is that a thousand percent thing that
7437720	7445240	will work out? Correct. Okay. Cause that, so that's a thousand percent always. Okay. Okay. Great.
7445880	7451640	I have a good one. Okay. You too. Make sure you, when you find, when you follow up on that,
7451640	7456440	be sure to look out and let me know if there's a lizard, you see any sizes of the one I was mentioning.
7457160	7464520	Yeah. Great. Okay. Okay. Okay. That sounds good. And just let me know there if it ever reoccurs
7464520	7470840	there. Okay. Okay. Great. Um, I'm going to try to figure out this, this trip, uh, because I think
7470840	7477880	if I get them to go on the trip and I can see how far we're going to be there for. Okay. It sounds
7477880	7482360	good. Okay. Is that something that I would want to get an extra one for or what do you think?
7483640	7489560	No, it's a buy one, get one free offer. Okay. So if I could, is it possible to double them up to
7489560	7496200	wear them to stack them? No, there is. Well, is that because why is that? Because it just
7496200	7500680	fits on the side of your head. You can't double it, but I could, I could put it on there on the front.
7502120	7507000	No, it won't fit because you gotta push them out further. They won't go. Oh, so it's like a,
7507000	7513880	it's like a telescope. It's a similar, but, but it's just like a pair of glasses. You can't put
7513960	7518840	two on because the glasses get in the way of each other. Oh, I'll put two glasses on before
7520840	7524920	you just put them on, on top of the one that's underneath the other one.
7526280	7531240	You know, you ever had double done double sunglasses or sometimes say my uncle has
7531240	7537160	prescription, uh, glasses, but he also wears sunglasses and he'll put his sunglasses on over
7537160	7542280	the prescriptions and then he just does it. And you know, he goes hunting and he drives that way.
7542280	7550840	He'll fish. So I'll, I'm going to do that too. But when I'm on vacation, okay. Okay. That sounds
7550840	7558360	good. Um, thanks for telling me all that about weather. Okay. Great. Are you going to, are you
7558360	7562200	going to figure out what you, what to call the weather? Cause you said you just not hop.
7563800	7567480	Yeah. Just go online and search it on Google. What should I search?
7567480	7572680	Just go to Google and search weather. Okay. Now I'm going to search. What do you call it
7573400	7581160	when it's, what temperature do you say it is? When it, when it gets up above, uh, when
7583160	7589720	humidity is up above 70%, 70% then what I type in then after that,
7590600	7594280	you'll see what it pulls up with that. Just type in, see what it pulls up after that.
7595000	7605560	Correct. Okay. When it gets up above 70%, see what it pull, hold on, pulls up after that.
7605560	7611880	I did it. It said, it said rate shock in California, Obamacare to increase individual health.
7612520	7622360	I am Boise spokesman.com. Um, U S and news world, uh, Philadelphia has a descent of
7622360	7632120	500 feet above the ground. Uh, Kevin Slavin, how algorithms shape our world. Here's one. Um,
7633160	7636760	journalist has fallen 10%. I don't see anything about weather here.
7637720	7642040	Yeah. What I shall put your state book. The first thing you told me was that
7642040	7646360	it's not hot out. You said it's not hot, even though it's almost, it's in the nineties,
7646360	7649960	but you didn't say it's not double warm. What would you call it then?
7653320	7660280	To me, it's not hot. What was that? To me, it's not hot. Okay. But what would you call it then?
7660280	7666280	You just say not hot. No, just warm. Just warm. Okay. How much cooler does it have to get to be
7666280	7677240	not warm? Down to 20 degrees, 20 degrees. Wow. So you mean 20 degrees all the way up to 80 degrees
7677240	7688200	is warm. Just warm. What do you call it when it's below 20? Cool. Cool. 20 to what is cool?
7689560	7695960	22 minus 10 minus 10 is cool. Wow. That's pretty interesting. Then what do you call it below minus
7695960	7701800	10? Then it gets cold. Okay. Then how, how much further does it get before it gets something
7701800	7707320	else besides cold? No, you can't get below cold. It's just cold. You can't get below cold.
7708200	7711880	Nope. Oh man. I didn't know that. I thought you can. What about coldest?
7713000	7721960	Nope. No, no, no. Coldest is just an adjective. Okay. So it's just an adjective. So basically
7721960	7729800	cold as cold can be negative 10 all the way down to, to the point in which matter stops moving
7729800	7735160	because it is zero degrees, huh? Correct. So zero degrees is the coldest it gets, right?
7735960	7737880	Nope. Oh, what's the coldest it gets?
7744280	7747960	Minus 50 minus 60. So it never gets colder than that ever?
7749080	7754680	No. Wow. Well, nothing has been registered. No. So, and the, wow. So the history of the world
7754680	7760280	and it's never gotten colder than 60 degrees below the zero. Nothing, nothing that has been
7760280	7764040	registered. Okay. Now it's been registered. So you think maybe like when dinosaurs were here,
7764040	7769640	it got really cold, like negative. Well, that's what everybody froze with. Yeah, they did. They
7769640	7778360	all froze. Yeah. Well, think of a, think of a glacier. Yeah. What's that? Oh, it's moving
7778360	7783720	ice. How, how does that work? Cause ice is hard. It's like, I gotta, I gotta get going. Well,
