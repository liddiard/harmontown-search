0	27560	Hooray, hoorah! Welcome everybody to the Fantapolis Conference of the Dynasty typewriter here
27560	32800	in MacArthur Park with the sweeping icings flowing down. Harman Town is now in session.
32800	48240	All right. Spencer Crittenden. And just for good measure, the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
48240	75240	Comic-con rap. Comic books going in the racks. Everybody's having a heart attack. Got defibrillators on the wall and there's no bathroom stall that isn't filled with gross flaming hot Cheeto diarrhea.
76240	93240	The bathrooms are the grossest. It doesn't matter how many stars your hotel has in San Diego that week. Every bathroom is a Tijuana. No offense to Tijuana, but offense to Tijuana. I've been there.
93240	115240	I mean, I think even the mayor of Tijuana would be like, you have a point about our bathrooms. They are not a place for surgery to take place. I think if you wash your hands during Comic-Con, they get dirtier than if you just don't wash them.
116240	126240	Anyways, thank you for that. I like that beat. That was like very old Western. It felt like I was on a prairie. Let's give it up for Zach McKeever up on the beat booth.
130240	143240	But don't let my forced anxiety driven rhymes cast a pallor on what was really probably one of the most delightful Comic-Cons ever, which is saying a lot because I always have a good time there. Did you have a good time at Comic-Con?
143240	160240	Oh boy, you love crowds and adulation and it was packed this year. I felt like on Thursday, it was as packed as Friday. And on Friday, I thought it was as packed as it was on Saturday of the prior year. And I didn't go on Saturday because I was terrified.
161240	187240	It's kind of interesting this year. I'm in some kind of limbo where I'm like, okay, I'm constantly aware of like, okay, Harmon, this is a thing to not be taken for granted, getting on a golf cart and doing this thing. It's a thing that you keep doing. You never say no to it. You go there. You definitely like it. It's a religious experience for you.
187240	206240	You go there and it's like Mecca for all these people. And you're a part of that. You're a little baby priest or Cardinal, dare I say, within this Vatican of... These are probably bad metaphors to draw upon in our turbulent times. But what analogy can you use anymore?
207240	227240	But anyways, this year, I was so afraid to either take it for granted or overindulge in it. I'm sick of my own face and voice. So I'm like, I don't want to be a rock star, nor do I want to pretend like I don't love this experience.
227240	245240	Then I ended up in like this totally Zen. I was like, this is what it is. This is what you do. Can you get to the lobby by 11 a.m.? 6 a.m.? Can you be here and talk to this person? And then what I didn't do is go to the Entertainment Weekly Party.
245240	271240	I didn't do these things that aren't in the moment because trying to get into the Entertainment Weekly Party is like the last... The Entertainment Weekly Party is a pagan ritual at Comic Con that is specifically designed to remind everyone that they are technically nerds and that that still means being unempowered and gross.
271240	295240	You could show up for the Entertainment Weekly Party at 7 p.m. with 40 tickets and 20 wristbands and a signed affidavit from Steven Spielberg saying, I approve of these invitations that you sent to this person. You could represent 50% of the guest list and they would still be like, well, I don't know.
295240	309240	It's kind of a hot scene. Can you wait over there for a second? And you're just like, come on, let me talk to Adam Savage and get out of here. I'm tired. Anyways, but I didn't go. I didn't go. And I didn't really see any of our famous friends. I didn't even see you. Yeah.
309240	331240	One of your most famous friends. I would see you. I would just see you over in the corner of something in the boat. That's basically one of the only places we saw each other. I think on that boat. And I look back at this as the year when it was the peak of maybe because given my age range, my trajectory, I wouldn't be surprised to find out.
331240	360240	This was the year when if you could measure it, like the most of my personal friends and acquaintances and things that I care about were there. And yet I didn't really I just kind of floated around like a like the same boat that I was on with that kind of weird like old school yacht. Even better, Jeff. Even better. Oh, yeah. This one had water jet pack people. I saw that there was a dude at night with like light up. Let's talk about the water jet pack people.
360240	387240	Water jet pack people. And Justin found out that he can't do fireworks, the city or harbor master or whatever I'm saying. They hate that. He can't do fireworks. What could be more flammable than the ocean? Justin. Justin Roiland, co-creator of Rick and Morty. He gets a yacht with his buddies every year. It's become a tradition and he wanted to do fireworks on it. And they said, no, you can't do that. But what you can do.
388240	402240	I don't know if they provide this, this, this alternative. Yeah, there's all this number. There's these two guys that adorn themselves in Christmas lights and hover over the ocean on fire hose jet packs.
403240	429240	And I spent most of the night talking to the star of Farscape about whether or not those guys had other jobs. And that was the most fun. I was just saying I took an extra 10 milligrams of Adderall. I was shit faced. I feel bad for the star of Farscape. I never met him. I really him in the onion night. I just I'll never see them again. The man I fucking let Liam Cunningham have it.
430240	448240	Don't be the last Game of Thrones guy at the Justin Roiland yacht party with Dan Harmon on it. You're going to get all of that. I don't know. I was scattered the last time. I was like, oh, I can do shots with Ramsey Bolton. I was just just the onion. I was just like, you're mere like my mere characters like me.
451240	455240	I got no fingers. I lost my fingers.
455240	479240	Yeah. That last last time I was there, there was that boat and then I turned the corner and there was Sam, the chubby. Oh, yeah. Reedy guy. And he talks to my ex. Wait. Okay. Let's let's let's talk. Let's talk a little bit more about that. Jesus.
479240	507240	God. Anyway, I got to get out of here. No, no. Well, on that boat party, he was talking to my then girlfriend and we broke up at a point. But then like his birthday rolled around it. Like she commissioned a picture for him for his birthday. I'm like, Oh, I guess they still talk. That's cool. He you know, he won the Game of Thrones. Ah, he kind of did. He kind of did. Yeah. I mean, did you put the timeline together ever and go, wait a minute. Is he doing that?
509240	538240	Is he the causal thing about all this? It's like, I hope so. That would be awesome. She met him on a boat. Then we broke up. Then she drew a painting of them. And then, yeah, that's, that is. Yep. That works. Those three things did happen in that order. Cause we were dating. That's kind of the role that we had in the show. He was like, Oh, I'm no, I'm no brand the broken, but I really am the metaphor for the author and the puppet master of everything. And nothing battle ever happened to me. And.
540240	552240	I just, I just, I'm going to get all the, the, uh, West, Westeros puss. And she was pregnant too. What? No, no. Oh, cause Gilly was pregnant in there. Okay. Uh,
554240	563240	was it, was it more, uh, GOT folks on the boat? No, no, no. Who were there? Farscape folks. Lin-Manuel Miranda was there. My good friend.
563240	591240	Did you guys squash your beef? No, we were back to back for an uncomfortable amount of time. I should have every time. I don't know. I, I, when I left that party, I identified several errors that I made. And that was one of them. Oh boy. There was about six or seven crucial errors that I made. And Lord knows what the party would have been in my life. If I did not make those errors, I probably wouldn't be here tonight. Justin and I collectively, although I want to say I had no fucking party.
593240	621240	I don't know if he, how much he did, but like somehow we, after the boat closed, um, we accidentally spread the idea that there was a party happening at the Hilton. And when the reality was the only thing happening at the Hilton was us going to bed. And we accidentally, we, we horribly pie pipered, like a bunch of people that probably lived the opposite direction.
622240	638240	And the boat was so far away from the Hilton. Yeah. And so are all the other hotels. Like if you're at the Marriott and you walk from the boat to the Hilton, you're going to be mad walking back. You'll be mad walking to the Hilton. Yeah. No, they were. They were mad.
639240	656240	Uh, Nick Rutherford, a new, uh, Rick and Morty writer, he, at one point he got on one of those scooters and, uh, and that was, he, he kind of, he, he tried to make things better by, he was doing, he was buzzing us as a, with millennial, uh, quotes. Like he was just, it was, he kept zipping by us and then saying.
657240	661240	Tubular. Well, he was like saying, it was like lateral stuff. He was like, I'm a team player.
662240	675240	They were good. It was good. He had a good gig cause he could like whiz by us, come up with one and then think about it and do it, come back. And it was perfect. It was like a great bit. I was really excited.
676240	698240	Uh, yeah. And I made, I made some new friends and I talked to a lot of fans and I, I was like, I was really, I felt, I felt more like mirroring more in the moment. If you encountered me in San Diego, I don't know if you had more of a powerful thing than in a day when I was less in the moment and worried that you were going to hurt me or something.
699240	719240	But I, I felt like I had more intimate conversations with, uh, with the people I talked to and there were a lot of people, for instance, say, you know, like not a lot of people, but the proper like fraction of people going like mentioning my workout on the Instagram and how they've been watching it and, and, and, and rooting for it or whatever the, whatever you want to say about that.
719240	743240	People saying like, Hey, are you going to do another Whiting Wongs? I'm like, I don't know. Should I, I don't know. Four more people asked and I'll do it. And then a fourth person asked, but it was Jessica Gao. So I, I ran, I ran into her and I was like, um, uh, yeah, I was like, maybe we should, she, she suggested, well, why don't we, instead of thinking about whether you do another season of Whiting Wongs, why don't you do like, why don't we just do one-offs? Like, like, what's, what's the harm of just getting together and doing like an episode?
743240	745240	Haven't you whited all the Wongs?
745240	761240	Well, that's the thing. Is that's why I want it. I was like, I was like, well, we're talking in circles and I, there's a point where it's actually distracting, right. Yeah. But, but I think, I think, I think enough WONGs. Have I think there's racial equality's been restored. Yes, exactly. Yeah.
761240	763140	Yeah, yeah, all right.
763140	767680	Well that's a, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,
767680	768680	I, I, I, I, I.
768680	769960	You're like the robot from the Power Rangers.
769960	771160	Hey Dan, bring the mic up a little bit.
771160	773360	I think the mic's a bit low for you.
773360	774680	I think the mic's a bit low.
774680	775680	Yeah.
775680	777400	Bring it up a little.
777400	778640	Operate your microphone.
778640	779740	Stand.
779740	786760	With one hand.
786760	798520	Now that's that's a microphone. How does that feel for you? Why is this the first
798520	810120	time in like eight years that this has been important? You're almost there. Try
810120	822320	her out. Take her for a spin. Kick the tires. Hello. It's so funny now. Having
822320	825840	so many flashbacks to the first day I combed my hair in seventh grade. I was
825840	831680	thinking the same thing. You were all there. Your applause was as hurtful then
831680	839240	it is as it is now. Look who showered. We told you you'd love it. You smell great.
839480	845880	Steve Levy in the vodka. Ice bucket. All right well let's bring out our guest.
845880	852600	Very old friend of the podcast. Haven't been talking to him enough lately.
852600	859200	Needs no introduction really. You sound so good right now man. It's like your
859200	873680	hair's been combed. Your shoes are tied. Your back was too low bro. For eight
873680	885200	years? No just just today. Today it was too low. I mean I just yeah. You look
885200	892720	great. All right well please welcome our friend, cousin, statesman, brother, Duncan
892720	895160	Trussall.
897640	901040	Oh yeah.
905840	914440	Duncan Truffle. Hello. I know the music sounded like your job was now to throw a
914440	922160	knife at a woman and miss. You sounded very like please welcome the the enigmatic
922160	931920	professor blade. Do you have any volunteers? What I'm about to practice may look to you
931920	938920	like murder. But it's magic. It's magic. I follow you into the light and kill you
938920	943720	again. I don't think there's a more unimpressive way to describe that trick
943720	951640	than missing someone with a knife. It's so negative. I mean I love it. It's like
951640	958480	William Tell is just like some asshole. Oh he missed his kid. Yeah. I guess that's
958480	961560	when they brought the balloons in. They're like can I can we put this in a
961560	967280	positive way in the press release? He hit a balloon. Yeah. Asterix that was
967280	973440	really close to a lady. Right. So did he miss the lady? Because I'm not coming to
973440	977480	see the show if he didn't miss the lady. Yes sir he missed the lady but we want you
977480	983920	to know that he's a proactive knife thrower. He doesn't just miss things. Okay. I was
983920	987800	gonna say I could miss a lady with a knife. I've been doing it for 30 years. That's called
987800	997640	marriage. Sir that that that weird forced donkey laugh doesn't doesn't doesn't make
997640	1004560	your inherent misogyny any lighter. I thought I thought it did and I'm a paying customer.
1004560	1009640	You're gonna let me let me in. Let me into your knife show. We're standing out. I'm standing
1009640	1012760	on a sidewalk outside the theater where the knife show's happening. That's what you don't
1012760	1019680	know. All right. Let's move on. Hey Duncan. What's been. Yeah. What's new in duck and
1019680	1024880	trust. I mean like I know a couple staples. What do you mean? Oh I had a baby. Yeah. I
1024880	1033360	got a little baby now. Yeah. Thank you. That applause is that that that's role. That's
1033360	1038280	the rolling applause of people who really respect the Duncan Trussell kind of brand
1038280	1044640	because they're like should he have a kid. Oh. Yeah. Well they're like I think he maybe
1044640	1050240	should but should he. I don't know. That's it's different from like I mean who. Oh Bill
1050240	1055600	Cosby. Oh yeah. He had a kid. He's America's dad. Look how that turned out. Jesus Christ.
1055600	1060600	I'm not. Well I can't. First of all I'm getting so insecure up here. Really. I'm still stuck
1060600	1064960	on the brain donkey laugh with you are making fun of my laugh. Now you're comparing me to
1064960	1069280	Bill Cosby. No. I was. No. I'm never making fun. I don't. I don't have time to make fun
1069280	1077560	of other people. I can't. I can't. I can't even see you through my ass lining. I'm wearing
1077560	1083720	my own sphincter as a blindfold. I. Wow. Yeah. I was. You know my wife actually asked
1083720	1090600	me today if I had a prolapse like if my asshole fell out in the bathroom would I call for
1090600	1095040	help for her. This is a hypothetical. Oh if you did. OK. Like yeah. Like you know the
1095040	1100800	question was like if you had an approach like if your rectum fell out would you call for
1100800	1106560	help or would you be too embarrassed. And I said I would fucking hang myself with it.
1107120	1113240	I was like I would call for help to anybody that was an earshot. I would get a plunger
1113240	1120120	and try and just stuff it back in a blender a plunger a blender a blender. Now that could
1120120	1127960	be something. Don't don't. Vitamix your prolapse. Here's a pro tip. Never use a blender to get
1127960	1133640	your prolapse asshole back inside your body. That's just a that's just a fool's errand.
1133680	1138120	I don't know. Is this prolapse a nice thing like just something. This is just a thing that
1139800	1144360	people started happens to talking about. It's like elephant tightest like in Breakfast Club.
1144360	1149480	Like it's like a thing that's like technically possible but it's not like a common. It doesn't
1149480	1153840	just happen to everybody like kidney happens all happens to one out of every day that your
1153840	1158960	asshole just falls out of your ass. It could happen to you tonight then. Yeah. Will happens
1158960	1163200	more on the full moon. Look everybody in the audience look to your left and then look to
1163280	1171080	your right. Both of those people suffer prolapse anuses. Is it a thing that just happens randomly
1171080	1182120	or is it associated with age. Does your it's vaccine related. Vaxers take heart Vaxers.
1182120	1189760	Yeah. I mean a lot of people think that the pediatricians are making money off the vaccines
1189760	1195920	but it's not the case. It's the pediatricians are usually connected to proctologists. If you do
1195920	1200320	it they're getting kickbacks from they get kickbacks from the proctologists. Yeah. So blast them with
1200320	1206480	a vaccine within a month their asshole falls out. You know the whole story classic. Yeah. That's
1206480	1212720	that's part of your recent Washington Post piece about prolapsed assholes and yeah pediatricians.
1212720	1217120	Yeah. I'm in a lot of danger probably. Yeah. Yeah. You're gonna get murdered. Well no people
1217200	1223440	keep trying to shoot me with vaccine darts. It's fucked up man. Then nobody will take you
1223440	1227360	seriously. They'll go. Oh he wrote this article because he has a prolapsed anus. He's trying to
1227360	1233440	make it part of something other than him being a real snook. Oh so you're gonna call me a snook
1233440	1239040	because my asshole fell out. I'm just saying like a stigma against people who have that. You're
1239040	1245200	you're very life partner brought up the question like if it happened to you in your own bathroom
1245200	1250800	would you even call my name or would you be so embarrassed that this fate befell you that you
1250800	1258080	would simply try to stuff it back up there like a Kleenex with a plunger. I mean so shit so don't
1258080	1264800	don't don't look at me as the source of the of the of the of the shade over prolapsed anisery.
1264800	1270400	I I welcome it. Well I mean you did call it anisery. You don't even mean to do it but there's
1270480	1277600	a lot of stigma attached to prolapse. Does your partner uh often give you weird hypothetical
1277600	1284480	situations like that or is that the first one? Oh no she gets she she'll like the other day she
1284480	1290000	texted me uh because like I had it like I've been very busy lately so I had like a day off she's
1290000	1294960	like just relax just relax and like see if you know you could just chill out today and like
1294960	1301280	within two seconds the next text was if we get a home invader you know we have to fight for our
1301280	1308720	lives no matter what because they'll just kill us anyway. What? It was like our mind worked.
1309520	1314480	Is she just hanging her weird anxieties on you like just like let them like hang them out to dry
1314480	1319680	because you're talking to Russell? Well no I think she's gotten sucked into one of these mommy groups
1319680	1324240	and it's like because after you have a baby there's all these uh mommy groups is what they're
1324240	1328880	called so it's like mom's like sort of like support groups for having children people who
1328880	1334960	just had a baby which is like incredibly painful for the man for the woman it's not so bad they
1334960	1342080	fake it it's a different study but they have to they have to um meet in mommy group they have
1342080	1346000	like online mommy groups and I think somewhere in there some probably they were talking about that
1346000	1351040	your asshole can prolapse when you have a baby. It probably triggers I mean probably every instinct
1351680	1357200	uh possible regarding anything dangerous that can ever happen I think that's safe enough to say that
1357200	1365120	we see that in bearers of our nation's children like they through the eyes of those of us that
1365120	1371280	are childless like it's pretty easy to recognize that having a child changes you and not in ways
1371280	1377440	that are fun for the childless because everything is becomes about like that's a pretty sharp corner
1377440	1383680	of a of a of a electrical outlet like that's right like and just beyond that I mean because
1383680	1388480	that's understandable definitely uh cover your electrical outlets everything what brand of baby
1388480	1396800	did you have boy girl we had a boy a boy yeah brand we had a Costco boy yeah it's great now
1396800	1402880	it's wonderful but yeah you do go for you can't you have if you like watch an episode of preppers
1403760	1410080	and you will see peak that's what authentic doomsday preppers call doomsday preppers preppers
1410080	1415200	no you've seen the show preppers yeah we're on a last name basis with the act of doomsday prepping
1415200	1420560	that's how prepped we are yeah like you have to abbreviate it because yeah because these
1420560	1426640	fucking doomsday is coming preppers like what else are you prepping for fucking salad no doomsday
1426640	1433360	is everyone's first course but it happened that's like you will you can become a prepper
1433360	1437440	if you have a baby pretty easily and then you could see you could see how it goes yeah you're
1437440	1444160	just like yeah how does your prepping like walk us through a new father's prepping like what do
1444160	1449280	you do well I can't break that or all in half and put it in my pocket anymore I have to put it back
1449280	1455440	in the bottle because the baby might reach in with its little sausage fingers you can't have
1455440	1460640	first of all thing is like if you in the old days I was like a walking yeah you know I like
1460640	1466160	like wild animals pick up seeds in the forest that's what I was with drugs just in my pockets
1466160	1472560	like sticking you know in your hair you're like oh fuck a bag of ketamine holy shit so you can't
1472560	1478720	you know what I mean you can't do that you can't have you can't have any there can be no so that
1478720	1482960	your your doomsday prepping for your baby is just not having loose drugs hanging about
1482960	1489680	just getting the psilocybin out of your beard in case it wants to kiss you you can't do it anymore
1489680	1495440	so that's a pragmatic approach and then and then um you know what am I what am I gonna do fucking
1495440	1501360	like build a a arc or something I could now I don't I don't have the discipline I'm to do that
1501360	1508640	kind of I don't think you're gonna have to build an arc but that's what someone told someone a long
1508640	1516960	time ago and look what happened you're not gonna have to build an arc trust me but name one other
1516960	1522240	guy that had to build an arc name one other person that had to build an arc you mean besides Noah yeah
1522240	1529360	name one other person well the unicorn as it turns out should have yeah damn he didn't the
1529360	1534720	unicorn didn't he was wearing beautiful suits and having fun hosting shows and then look what
1534720	1538400	happened to him you know that sign they didn't make you sing that song when you're in grade school
1538400	1544640	yeah rats and bats and elephants and porpoises too and everybody didn't give a fuck about the
1544640	1551280	unicorn it was that there's a song yep but i'm so sad fucking traumatic song for children that they
1551280	1556320	taught me in my milwaukee public school was like i was like oh god this fucking song again like it
1556320	1563600	takes you through the ballad of how the unicorn what once fucking froliced along with every other
1563600	1571280	animal and uh then then this fucking biblical event happened in the i don't know if the unicorn
1571280	1576080	was i don't know the unicorn was out fucking around having a good old time and didn't get on
1576080	1582960	the boat yeah was it harry shaping i don't think any animal deserves to not be on the arc did they
1582960	1590800	not care about dinosaurs well the i mean no the problem was at that time the dinosaurs were um
1591280	1597440	they were i think extinct we had bones planted by the devil yeah the yeah test us yeah the devil
1597440	1603120	planted fucking giant bones everywhere but the bible talks about the leviathan and the behemoth
1603120	1607920	aren't those like dinosaurs or something those are whales those are boring both of them yeah
1607920	1612480	well they're extinct whales you're saying okay those are dinosaurs they're extinct i thought
1612480	1616880	that those were the bible talking about dinosaurs they're like check this out there's a brontosaurus
1617120	1621360	called behemoth the bible talks there is no brontosaurus it's a made-up dinosaur i think it's
1621360	1628800	real dinosaurs are made up what they're just you know it i know it oh you're gonna do the agenda
1628800	1637840	huh okay there was dinosaurs the whole planet was covered in lizards yeah running around big old
1638800	1646560	lizard jeff yeah that makes sense that's how i'd make a planet covered in giant lizards yeah sure
1646880	1650480	because that's not just something you say when you were high and an atheist
1653440	1659920	that's right did you hear the thing i heard uh there was a mpr thing a radio lab thing where
1659920	1667120	they kind of updated the the the um the model of what of the extinction event for dinosaurs
1667120	1673360	and whereas we used to think it was like meteor hits and cloud of dust goes up blocks out the
1673360	1677440	sun plants die things that eat the plants die things that eat the things that eat plants die
1678400	1688320	no it was a fucking supersonic bullet from from the the great unknown that that that shot into
1688320	1696240	the planet at somewhere around the speed of sound or light and fucking like vaporized so much rock
1696240	1704800	as it jetted into the planet that that the rock vapor filled the atmosphere immediately started
1704800	1711600	cooling turned into a cloud of tiny glass beads that got so hot as they started falling back to
1711600	1717200	the earth that the entire planet in the span of two hours got as hot as a pizza oven and every
1717200	1727360	living thing on earth died from having their blood boiling yeah i know that's fun and it does hold
1727360	1732160	up because because it is it would otherwise be weird it was some of the best pizza we ever had
1735200	1738560	but definitely you'd be dead before your blood boiled there's no way
1738560	1743680	you know your blood doesn't you're like oh god that's jingly i think my blood's boiling
1743680	1747840	but i what i still don't understand those so okay then what because what we always learned
1747840	1751840	is that oh the dinosaurs all die as a meteor in the sky and i think and then the little
1751840	1757120	the little marmoset comes out that represents us you know and they show you the film at the museum
1757120	1761600	and it's like that's us like there's like a little a little thing with big eyes comes out of a log
1761600	1770560	and it's like what what that thing don't that thing don't got no boilable blood player i think
1771120	1776080	you know what yeah i know they had adapted oh they stayed underground because they were
1776080	1781120	giant lizards gonna eat them so they learned to live like under the radar but i mean all right
1781120	1785440	well i i don't look i mean it's worth give it a google this isn't the podcast to learn stuff
1785440	1792240	um i did think of you uh speaking of doomsday prepping though uh uh uh uh i think of you for
1792240	1796880	other reasons other than this but there is this um there's i don't know if you've if you've heard
1796880	1802800	of this guy um and now i can't remember his goddamn name so i can't ask you if you've heard
1802800	1808240	of him but maybe you'll remember his name if i describe what he was a he was like a hacker guy
1808240	1814880	that was like a genius and then he um he got like sentenced to some stuff for hacking early in his
1814880	1818720	life but then he like they let him off because he was like just a bright kid and they're like don't
1818720	1822880	waste his life let him let him be smart with computers and maybe he'll now that he's learned
1822960	1828800	his lesson and he like was an early bitcoin adopter and then he like invested all his bitcoin
1828800	1834080	money into like the style he was just so he was just like super rich and super autonomous and
1834080	1841440	super smart and then he got really really paranoid and he uh he was he he got a house and he he dug
1841440	1847760	tunnels under the house that were going in every direction all under his entire neighborhood
1847760	1852640	underneath all his neighbor's houses which i always i was like you could just do that fuck
1852640	1859120	i want that's all i've ever wanted to do yeah me too is minecraft underneath everybody and just be
1859120	1862960	like like like like i mean i wouldn't like eavesdrop on you or anything i'd just be like
1862960	1867120	under your house and i'd be like happy and you'd be happy because you'd be like i love showering
1867120	1874320	and i'd be like i love dirt and i every once in a while i'd i'd grab the pipes like chunk and the
1874320	1879520	goonies and chunk you know uh what's his name sloth and go like like that and then i'd hear the
1879520	1886640	calamity above me that would be so fucking weird but the guy you under someone's house like it's
1886640	1892080	like harmony bura down there he's got but the guy was totally prepping for doomsday that's why he was
1892080	1897120	digging these tunnels and he was soap and he but he had some plan that involved like app development
1897600	1906160	and he hired this kid to work for him and he was so dedicated to and no one knowing about his
1906160	1910320	tunnels because what good is a network of tunnels under your house if anybody knows about him except
1910320	1914480	for all the people he hired to dig them and let just leave after they were like these are gonna
1914480	1919760	cave in pretty soon bye um and he didn't do anything about them but he this kid that he
1919760	1925840	hired to write his mysterious doomsday software um he put he did this whole thing where he picked
1925840	1930480	him up from an airport he put like a crazy like uh silicon valley version of a blindfold on him
1930480	1935520	drove him around for three hours took him to the fucking tunnels gave him a bucket an xbox and a
1936080	1942560	laptop and and said you're gonna work down here why can't he work at a hotel i don't know um i guess
1942560	1946240	he didn't really want him to literally know what city he was in maybe i don't know but he didn't
1946240	1952720	dig a hotel he can't dig a hotel i mean he tried to disastrous results because then like at some
1952720	1959280	point uh a fire happened down there i mean the guy had no he was a hoarder and he was you know
1959280	1965120	he was very very very paranoid about the government you know knowing everything he was doing not not
1965120	1971600	that paranoia doesn't typically apply to like also this is a fire hazard um and and so he just
1971600	1978080	had stacks of newspapers and magazines and things and um and and had this kid living down in his
1979040	1986000	spider dungeon um well he lived upstairs and then the kid texted him like i smell smoke
1986000	1990320	and it might be an electrical fire and he was like all right then i'll turn off all the lights
1990320	1995440	down there clunk and and then and then like so then that guy was down there walking through a
1995440	2002640	maze of hoarded newspapers and burning walls and he probably passed out from smoke inhalation and
2002640	2007680	died one of the most horrible deaths you can what and uh the the the guy made it out under the lawn
2007680	2011920	and was like i think someone's in there and the fire department was like holy shit there's a
2011920	2018320	fucking prairie dog city under your house anyways do you remember do you know that guy's name michael
2018320	2029280	stipe darryl clunt that was close no it's it's like eric dewitt or something no man i don't know
2029280	2034560	that guy's name it just seemed like the kind of guy like like that maybe your you know your your
2034560	2040080	your your your congregation and my congregation they they have a joyful overlap i think i like to
2040080	2045840	think and then i but then there's like there's stuff that your congregation probably thinks about
2045840	2051120	more than than my perception of mine and i thought that might be one of them that that if a guy was
2051120	2054320	like who was convinced that the world was ending so much that he dug all these tunnels and then
2054320	2059360	accidentally killed a dude i thought maybe that was well you know man to what i think when i see
2059360	2067600	these fucking preppers is why do you want like they want to stay alive after everything ends yeah
2067600	2072320	like while things are happening they're not that into it they want right you know what i'm saying
2072320	2078400	so it's like that you look at the life of this subterranean i know i know i know why why
2079280	2086240	because i'm from wisconsin that's not why i that's why i know why yeah because i i that's something
2086240	2095760	that i'm coping with in therapy is this insidious compulsive fear of being uh schmuck of being uh
2095760	2105920	uh the the the the mark the rube okay there's so much emphasis in the midwest on um how you
2105920	2110400	those people in california new york they're crazy they're pretentious they're delusional
2110400	2115760	they don't understand that you're supposed to have winter for 10 months um and that your
2115760	2123280	car door is supposed to freeze broken um they they're not practical people we're practical
2123280	2130400	people and if you're ever should you ever be um caught off guard by your taxes or your medical
2130400	2136720	payments or anything like that it's like there's a bigger fear of that and i'm only using my ice
2136720	2140480	statements i'm not if you're from milwaukee and you're like fuck you i'm fucking cool and i
2140480	2149440	skateboard um on ice um but but but i'm so i mean but i do think it's like a cultural thing like in
2149440	2158240	the in the more in the less coastal thing where you're like uh uh i i i i i i i i am more afraid
2158240	2166800	of uh being anyone's sucker than i am afraid of not living a a fun life okay so so like that
2166800	2175760	it's like you you you can live to 75 in a freezing tundra thumbing your chin uh it's a midwestern
2175760	2181920	thing um if you do it with your nose it might break off the the you you can you can die happy
2181920	2186480	going like these yeah but at least i didn't go to california where those people are crazy
2186560	2193280	they talk to their own hair they're crazy like like and and and so i that's that's i'm not saying
2193280	2198480	this guy's from the midwest i'm saying doomsday prepping i totally get it because i when i think
2198480	2204240	about it i get i'm like yeah yeah yeah yeah because my biggest nightmare about about turning
2204240	2210160	on the tv and and and have it have it's doing well it happened the thing that you've been thinking
2210160	2214560	might have happened for 40 years because it's like one of many things that might happen what
2214560	2220880	happened and i don't have the fucking bag of shit i could have bought yeah for 40 years i'm
2220880	2227360	just going to be like oh i lost at life yeah when really that's not how you lose it life you lose
2227360	2234320	it life by living after the apocalypse yeah by living in a shit tunnel with a bunch of newspapers
2234320	2243600	and smoke and you to climb out and why it's a i it seems like the entire phenomena is
2245360	2252000	really really tragic not just because the preppers kids like god may you never be born
2252000	2258240	to a family of preppers it's the fact that those people should what they say is going to happen
2258240	2264080	happens that's the those are the going to be the people who create the next human race
2265120	2270320	well i mean and that and that resonates with like our our model of like australia and america like
2270320	2275840	we we often refer to that as if there's like maybe a oh you know you know why americans are
2275840	2282720	obsessed with tits and guns is because it's part of our like genetic socio psychological
2282720	2287840	like thing that we were like where we run from things and panic more easily because back in the
2287840	2295200	day when traveling the atlantic was 70% lethal yeah like it actually created a filter of the
2295200	2299520	kind of people that had children from which people are descended and actually it's some people will
2299520	2304720	make the argument that like australians and americans are like we're different like in our
2304720	2311520	psychology in our culture because it's like we're descended from from cool crazy people oh you mean
2311520	2316560	like yeah like the crazy survivors or whatever like that you're the the word where we have some
2316560	2322320	kind of like genetic survival weirdness that we're paranoia i think paranoia is like probably the
2322320	2327920	better way to talk about it yeah well for sure i mean definitely paranoia i mean in in anger a lot
2327920	2333120	of it a lot of anger i mean the country's been at war for what is it 93 percent of its history now
2333120	2338320	94 percent of its history hours yeah i think it's 93 percent someone out there probably knows 93
2338320	2343520	percent 94 of our history we've been at war now they're finding out trauma gets encoded in your
2343520	2349280	dna there's epigenetic trauma so even if you didn't go to war if like your grandfather went
2349280	2355360	to war and he did well there you go hey yeah that's great so it gets stuck in you yeah
2356640	2360880	good job well that's cool because i didn't really talk to my grandpas as much as i should have
2360880	2365760	given that they fought nazis well you basically did with your genes yeah now now i can be like
2365840	2373200	you know it's a hard war yeah i'm gonna go out back and take a photo of me smoking a cigarette
2373200	2379600	on a tank yeah i always feel like the doomsday preppers are the worst off because it's not like
2379600	2383680	i guess there's some of them who do it secretly but like if anyone knows your doomsday prepper
2383680	2388160	that's the first place i'm gonna fucking go to it's like you probably want to like if someone
2388160	2392400	has like a crazy house full of water it's like i'm gonna go shoot that place up you're not gonna
2392480	2396960	do that you're not gonna shoot up a place i'm just thinking of like the the masses that are
2396960	2402000	that are looking for people and haven't i'm going to go straight to dance place i might yeah me too
2402000	2405920	that's my that's my disaster point when it all falls to shit i'm going straight to dance place
2405920	2409680	because he has a gun he doesn't know how to work he's got all the water he's got he's got all the
2409680	2416000	water he he'll he'll point a gun that's he has the safety on he doesn't know how that fucking
2416000	2420800	thing happens it'll be like an action movie hey look i i live here now and we're gonna have
2422240	2424880	and then i'm gonna take your gun i'm gonna show you how to work it
2424880	2432960	oh and then kill you that kind of shit what a roller coaster ride yeah i went into a uh
2432960	2437120	when i when we were shooting this show when i was shooting the show joe rogan called joe rogan
2437120	2444640	questions everything we were like it was a very funny show because he because he never questioned
2444640	2455280	joe rogan admit it it's like we both went into the show i know i did we both went into the show
2455280	2460240	with a kind of like uh i really thought maybe we're gonna fucking find something i remember
2460240	2463840	you telling me about this because you and i this is like like seems like a different world but we
2463840	2470080	were briefly talking about like developing a thing yeah yeah yeah that's right like where you go and
2470080	2475600	you were like i just did that and it's like it didn't it well it was it was because if you
2475600	2480400	want to treat you art bell does it really in a in a perfect way or he did in a perfect way
2480400	2486640	wait did he died right unfortunately art bell passed so yeah anyway he um did he like would
2486640	2492320	just let people talk about the story he doesn't question it whereas like rogan over the course
2492320	2498720	of the series began to realize like oh yeah when it's not of course it's not it's not out there
2498800	2503760	we're just meeting we're meeting with people who are like saying they have alien seeds and
2503760	2510400	planted in them and stuff and but anyway we ended up in a underground subterranean limestone
2511360	2519120	cave i ended up there metaphorically creatively yeah that too but called reality television yeah
2519120	2526400	but it was a it was like an us a limestone cave the government had used a store shit and then
2526400	2531280	this guy bought it and he was renting out space where he could park your rv down there
2531840	2540000	and you realize like once the doors shut right the blast door shut and it locks that guy becomes
2540000	2546560	yeah king i saw a thing uh yeah i remember you telling me about that it was like let's
2546560	2550960	try they put a tricycle out there because they like stories of it it's like oh the future tomorrow
2550960	2556000	thing it's like oh god no like lord it's a playground set underground yeah like remind me
2556000	2562560	that i'll be coming here with a child when there's no law and i'm still who i am that's right uh and
2562560	2568400	can't do a sit-up much less stand up to the guy who had the foresight and biceps to dig a hole
2568400	2573760	i'm living in now that's right here's my toddler uh take care of her i'm gonna go hunt for frozen
2573760	2581760	pizza yeah um i hope nothing untoward happens as you create a new society with my mosquito coast
2581760	2587200	um anyways the uh mosquito coast you gotta watch that movie it's amazing i think it's
2587200	2592560	actually really relevant now it's harrison ford so you can be into it um that's before he was
2593120	2599520	so sleepy like he was still he still was like looking forward to stuff like you could tell he
2599520	2604240	was like i don't know maybe i'll be king leer i don't know it was before that point where he was
2604240	2610480	like i can't everyone gets mad when i complain he crashed a plane on a golf course and brilliantly
2610480	2616640	it was all doctors were golfing that day and he crashed a plane and it was just a bunch of
2616640	2624560	off-duty doctors that saw to hon solo that's fucking there there was uh there i i clicked
2624560	2630640	on this youtube video uh that was a tour of like something like it was like the headline was like
2631440	2640240	uh take a tour of uh the world's most expensive uh bomb shelters or something something caught my
2640240	2644000	attention that was like i don't know they call them most expensive or they just named the price
2644000	2648400	like for one billion dollars you could live here after the apocalypse or something and it was like
2648400	2656960	an abandoned uh military missile silo so makes sense you're like oh wow cool where do you want
2656960	2664480	to be in the event of something horrible oh a re a decommissioned place where they actually thought
2664480	2668320	people were going to be sitting and pushing the buttons that was nucleating the world like like
2668320	2672400	probably a good place to start with your little lord of the flies fantasy that'd be like the best
2672400	2678000	arabian b but it was so it was it was like like the whole thing was like like the intro
2678000	2681920	of it the description of it was sort of like this is for rich people this is for rich people and it
2681920	2689600	was like it was so depressing it was almost therapeutic because you were like yeah it it
2689600	2697680	like richness in the apocalypse is going to buy you literally the right maybe kind of
2697680	2704800	of to pull up to the entertainment weekly party of having been promised that your billion
2704800	2710160	dollars is still worth anything yeah what's the currency at that point i like what is gold worth
2710160	2715120	i swear to you i'm i was like when i thought about the day of like say you own you have
2715120	2719120	because it's like a timeshare thing or like or what not timeshare but like a condo kind of thing
2719120	2726400	where you own a segment of this vast underground place and it was impressive in terms of its
2726400	2733440	like i the ability to keep people rich people alive for 100 years i'm it but it was a it really
2733440	2739040	opened your eyes to like oh my god if your only goal is to live and you spend all of your money
2739040	2744880	on that goal it's it really looked like hell when you thought about you're looking at the place
2744880	2750160	they're like we have and here's our wine cellar or like you know they do it and it was like yeah
2750160	2756960	but it's not you can't buy like making an underground thing and feel like freedom which
2756960	2760960	isn't that wild and and and then and you just kept imagining i kept what i was watching the
2760960	2766080	video and i just kept imagining like we can't have an election without tearing each other's
2766080	2773120	throats out we can't we can't have a 12 12 angry men can't decide on a on a verdict yeah without
2773920	2781520	fucking drama happening i life every life raft has a movie about how we're really just animals
2781520	2790560	um uh as its subjects like we you i can't imagine voluntarily getting in my station wagon because
2790560	2795440	the mushroom clouds are happening or the gas got released and i'm like i got my kids that i'm in
2795440	2801600	charge of protecting and my loved one and i'm like let's drive to the to the place where the doomsday
2801600	2806800	preppers are in charge and meanwhile people in a weird way do that every day they get in their
2806800	2812720	fucking cars and they drive to the to we are kind of in a doomsday prepper situation only we're not
2812720	2818160	underground with the rich people yet we're above ground with the rich people and we're like trusting
2818160	2823280	that everything's gonna gonna be fine even though it's clearly like people can't i have a friend she
2823280	2829200	can't get her insulin anymore like she just can't get medicine she has to drive to some place to get
2829200	2834320	the medicine it's very expensive and uh already it's where that thing where you're like well what
2834320	2839520	is worth anything it's like well one of the creepiest things i've many ever many creepy things about
2839520	2844080	the hot super extreme wealthy but one of the creepy things was money doesn't mean anything to
2844080	2848240	them anymore because they do favors for each other because who fucking needs money when you
2848240	2854240	have billions of dollars all you can do is favors so their currency is a currency of favors and
2854240	2858720	we're the ones who are like still into money and stuff like that and we're the ones who are hanging
2858720	2864800	our coats on their benevolence with this crazy idea that it's when everything becomes automated
2864800	2869760	they're gonna treat us great we'll be fine the people have all the money they love us they'll
2869760	2874000	be great to us because we're humans and you know they care about humans see how they treat you when
2874000	2883680	the money you paid for the right to bring your uh uh biologically viable uh family uh into a
2883680	2890560	rabbit burrow that was dug by a bitcoin investor um when the money that you paid him for the right
2890560	2897360	to a condo in his abandoned missus silo is now officially not worth anything yeah i'm sure he's
2897360	2904480	going to be real tactful at the next dinner party all right like about your wife's dek dek dek dek
2904480	2910480	dek a talash what the fuck did like like like like like the off-color uh comments that people make
2911280	2916400	like when it's like oh i like well i was kind of tacky to say to my girlfriend i was like well
2916400	2924560	wait a minute uh by tacky do you mean hey you could get beaten up by for that uh by the police
2924560	2930400	that i pay for with all of my money uh in a world where if that doesn't happen everything's going
2930400	2935360	wrong like like that it's just like the idea of like being in an actual situation where it's
2935360	2942640	nothing but fucking um just primate rules i'm like i think i would eat a bullet before we are
2942640	2952480	that like like the um um that's what we're in we're in it yeah no yeah like the uh the road the
2952480	2956240	did you see the road the movie the road yeah it's one of my favorites and they just have like like
2956240	2960800	it's almost like a brechtian because they don't they're not even bothering to try to convince you
2960800	2966000	anything other than it's just read out the windows and he's having this uh conversation
2966000	2972960	with his wife about like which bullets to use the road yeah i've only read the book there's
2972960	2978080	a film about that yeah it's terrifying how do you make a movie of that it's just about wandering and
2978080	2984640	being well it's a very just a lot of coughing you just fucking cough blood into a handkerchief
2984640	2990080	and your kid gets increasingly pale and then it's like i i would rather be the guy with the shopping
2990160	2995760	cart with his son wandering the desolate like wastelands uh an alkali just bullshit
2996320	3000480	than be the rich people underground i'd rather just take my chances and be mad max
3001040	3006400	yeah that's what's fun about it not not having a bunker well yeah but here's let's make the
3006400	3014640	apocalypse fun you guys yeah i think well at least i think what junk and i are both kind of
3014640	3020560	saying is that is that the rich people thinking that being underground is going to make it not the
3020560	3027280	shopping cart experience are so diluted and wasting so much of their energy right now not
3027280	3032720	just because you can grab a shopping cart from target right now put it in your backyard and be
3032720	3041200	as prepared for what happens the day humanity loses accountability as elon musk in a fucking
3041760	3048000	uh a tokyo coffin like that at the core of the earth like who anyone around there is just going
3048000	3054400	to be like he's not looking he's got his knickers in his pocket box cutter i think like maybe the
3054400	3060000	first page of uh of the road by kormat mccarthy uh it says like it's a father and a son and he i
3060000	3067120	think it's might be page one says each was his other world entire like like that that right there
3067120	3072400	is the whole book it's like the idea that if you have somebody that you care for that's that's
3072400	3080880	tragedy the backstory was that the matriarch like she had she had opted out right yeah she just
3080880	3085120	walked the way she killed herself was she just walked out into it and you were just so certain
3085120	3090560	to die that she just walked in some direction did she do it to save a bullet no i think she
3090560	3096800	just gave up she was just sort of like what's the point why are you it's just so fucking like i i
3096800	3102560	it's we because it used to be a fun thing to think about and it's like i i can't be scientifically
3102560	3107440	certain whether oh it's not fun to talk about because of our changing times i could easily
3107440	3111840	also another thing that's changed is i get older and older i get more and more i get more and more
3111840	3120000	in love i i i more and more my hell becomes the idea of of cody being hurt so i i mean that i
3120000	3126560	it's so i that's that line the the first line each was his other world entire like that the
3126720	3134800	idea that if you care for anything in an apocalypse that's instant tragedy that's why spencer has
3134800	3141280	always never he's never been as enthusiastic about my post-election very enthusiastic like
3142240	3146000	oh yeah Tuesday prepping because you're basically i know to make twine you know it'll be great
3146000	3150000	yeah making fishing traps but spencer kind of like vision wait wait what
3150000	3154800	you know you like you'd use so i've seen these youtube videos on facebook i guess they're
3154800	3160000	facebook videos you put some you put some pipes in the water and the fish go through and then you
3160000	3164960	got plenty of fish to eat but we had we had a slack channel what kind of we were using slack
3164960	3172800	to coordinate a secret survivalist colony yeah it was called babification and uh something uh
3172800	3178800	spencer at one point kind of like it was like his his is he's more capable than any of us
3178800	3182320	like we're like relying on like well spencer you should learn about ham radio and you should
3182640	3187680	it's like we're all relying on spencer and then it was like and spencer like yeah okay yeah and
3187680	3194400	like i think maybe cody or somebody probably was like hey spencer you are you are you not into this
3194400	3198560	you don't believe in this in this plan or that plan or you don't agree the thing and you you
3198560	3202480	because you were asked a direct question you answered directly and said i love those you're
3202480	3207840	like well you know i just think that when the shit hits the fan my chances of survival are
3207840	3214960	going to be a lot higher by myself yeah no that's i truly think i mean that's what all the
3214960	3219280	apocalypse stuff is about it's like you join a group and then politics happens and suddenly
3219280	3223600	your head's on a spike it's like i want to just be hiding in the woods catching my fishing pipes
3225360	3231040	oh so what are you saying yeah great get a shopping cart try to leave the kid out of it
3231040	3234960	if you can but here's the thing can i say something i think it's funny that we all
3234960	3239200	think the world ends in a way we need that we're going to be able to go into a subterranean tunnel
3239200	3243440	i know isn't that cute that's cute because it's just going to be some weird nano goo that we're
3243440	3249040	going to be stuck in traffic trying to get away there's going to be a nuke aimed at la and we're
3249040	3255280	going to all just be stuck in traffic i don't think it's that i think it's going to be what's
3255280	3260560	happening what's happening right now is it's going to be one one potential way it could end
3260560	3268320	is progressive layers of absurdity that drive everyone completely insane and and that starts
3268320	3275360	off with this like uh taking you animating you with an ai and then that ai becomes like a
3275360	3280080	thousand times funnier than you right and then it starts making its own youtube videos but then it
3280080	3285520	has an ai that's making its own youtube videos and the first you becomes completely irrelevant
3285520	3291120	so you have to deal with this kind of like my friend calls it a schizopolis where everything
3291120	3298240	just shatters and we all kind of end up being like lost in this tiny little sentient particles and
3298240	3306240	some kind of technological kaleidoscope where we've been completely irrelevantized by uh ai
3306240	3310080	and and there's no by the time you get in the tunnel you're like i don't even know if i'm me
3310080	3314960	or a version of me that's in a tunnel and then that's i think kind of i think that's what's
3314960	3320160	happening now why everybody's fuses are blowing and shit right now is because you know their
3320160	3325040	faces are buried in the phone which by the way that's another thing when you're a parent you
3325040	3330160	they keep saying like screen time is really bad for children and at the age it's bad for them
3330160	3336320	keeps going up and up and up and you're like it doesn't stop being bad for you it's bad for you
3336320	3341440	all the way through keep your kid off of a screen until they're 28 years old well yeah we're gonna
3341440	3348880	all raise a generation of powders uh but but i mean i'm 45 but if i don't crush the candy who's
3348880	3355280	gonna crush the candy i don't know it's one of the big questions right now i've been sent here i i i
3355280	3360400	believe i've been sent here to crush candy you gotta do it someone has to i think it's right
3360400	3366640	but what you're i think it's uh it's notable that the phenomenon that you're describing can be seen
3366640	3373760	on an atomic level um with uh with just our general stupidity the fact that like and i i'm
3373760	3379520	included in this i'll be sitting at a bar and i and everyone at the bar that's arguing about
3379520	3384880	some david hasselhoff reference or what year this happened or how much money this is everyone all
3384880	3390720	again we just we would rather sit and argue sometimes some bars have rules they go like
3390720	3395760	you know what the tradition of the bar argument about the cliff clavin bullshit is so rich and
3395760	3400640	important that the first person that looks at their phone is an is a traitor to the bar
3401200	3406880	crawling race um but it also just happens organically and not just in bars where it's like
3407600	3412480	look at what we're look at what we would rather do with our technology and i really don't mean this
3412480	3421360	like in the snobby sense i if anything i'm kind of like let's really look at the fact that we
3421440	3425840	we were we misled ourselves in the 50s and 60s when we started like splitting the atom and
3425840	3430480	writing sci-fi the things about our brains getting bigger from vitamin dinners and like
3430480	3435520	like to think that we really believed that that the smarter we're able to get the smarter we're
3435520	3441440	going to want to get the more information available to you like even in high school we were like
3441440	3447440	man if this teacher would just let me use this calculator and then the next year it was like oh
3447440	3450880	you can use your calculator now because they're everywhere and that's part of the test and it's
3450960	3455680	like all right well now i don't just take my seat it's that what you wanted to do is cheat on the
3455680	3460720	test with a calculator and then once it all all of a sudden one day this information is all available
3460720	3466400	to us we're walking around with an entire movie studio and encyclopedia of all of the earth's
3466400	3473760	like knowledge in our pockets and what we use the device for me included is we we we go to
3473760	3480560	social media gatherings and we go hey faggot hey homophobe hey fuck you faggot yeah
3480560	3484640	homophobe like and we just do it and then and then we'll like cut and paste stuff every once
3484640	3489520	in a while we'll like bother to google something and go yeah well 20 percent of the you're wrong
3489520	3497680	and it's like we we we don't want to know we don't want to be gods we don't want to be
3498480	3505120	calm we don't want to be like like we we actively so what you that's like in terms of what you're
3505120	3512400	saying like that day that that elon just launched his fucking neurofiber thing whatever the hell
3512400	3519040	it's like it's gonna he's like okay and then so the threads are very small and that's my impression
3519040	3524000	of him is that something that happened or is that hypothetical no he did it like what's
3524000	3528960	neurofiber he did a launch but it's a it's not it's called a neural link it's like uh it's for
3528960	3535520	your brain to compute on yep great it's an interface device that was after that was after
3535520	3541280	he put a convertible car in space that after he uh took yeah and crimes his eyes out as you guys
3541280	3547760	mocked him i kept saying um anyways but like he put a fucking convertible in space best midlife
3547840	3555920	crisis ever man yeah no shit fucking cool is there any more like apropos metaphor for a male
3555920	3560640	midlife crisis than being rich and putting a fucking dude you know it's gonna be badass when
3560640	3565760	like in thousands of years some like happy little alien society is like hanging out and
3565760	3570960	like the car just smashes through their alien driveway like what the fuck it's like blasting
3570960	3576400	some music it's got like a mannequin inside but like the aliens are gonna find the car
3576400	3581600	and the aliens that find the car are gonna have listened to their elons and they're gonna be like
3581600	3585520	look it's a car i bet they had an elon and they're gonna be like look at this cool car
3586080	3592240	no there's gonna be like a there's gonna be like he's my friend it'll be like if aliens came to
3592240	3596400	earth and they'll be like there's something inside and it's like oh that's just a mannequin
3596400	3600320	but it'll take like two weeks for them to find that out it'll be like a global incident for
3600320	3605280	these guys because the universe will be awesome because mathematically the universe is probably
3605280	3612960	infinite uh there's gonna be a chance that elon must stupid convertible car it's gonna run into
3612960	3619440	another like species car or like yeah i just explained how that would happen there's there's
3619440	3625280	gonna be a little oh there elon a little a little smash up which is all the more reason to launch
3625280	3630720	all your garbage cars big so that that accident is between two shitty cars that no one cares about
3630720	3636880	instead of a bus full of space nuns you've created space nuns you know that mathematical certainty
3636880	3643120	of douchebags in space like it's going to be as a hero you're not you're not friends with
3643120	3648160	him you met him we can we circle back to this three times at least three times i've met him
3648160	3656080	that's a friendship he doesn't give a he loves him it's a bromance classic bromance classic bromance
3656080	3662080	terrific terrific i'm glad you're happy for the classic romance he put a fucking convertible in
3662080	3667760	space that's jealous you're jealous no it's stupid it's science you know what they say that mannequins
3667760	3675040	made of what water balloons filled with his jizz i was close i think that sounds cool no that's
3675040	3682080	true now i'm back on board now i'm back on board also uh so the car from the alien species that
3682080	3687360	smashes into him it's going to be a fucked up mess yeah but that's but i guess jizz would freeze
3687360	3693440	in the vacuum of space eventually sperm spermato so is going to freeze and die instantly unless
3694480	3698560	he knows something we don't know that he's going to crack the car into a uterus
3699120	3704240	like like a space uterus it will be yeah that's what he's gonna do man can we circle back to the
3704240	3710240	insulin conversation oh jeez it was getting so heavy and awful i mean i'd rather talk about the
3710240	3720720	musk balloons i just like because musk balloons the cosmic the musk balloons just because like
3720720	3725520	because insulin costs a million dollars right do you know how much a balloon of Elon musk's come
3725520	3732240	costs i'm just saying a lot more than insulin man but it only costs like two dollars to make
3732240	3737920	insulin so that's called like a niche in the let's go hole in the market like we could sell
3737920	3744320	six dollar insulin and be fucking rich right yeah and why can't we do that we try to save lives
3744320	3749760	just by eating a candy bar i know we gotta look that's what i've been saying no but seriously
3749760	3755280	like i don't unless like there must be some sort of what do you call it like mob like medicine mob
3755280	3759280	that's preventing people from doing this right because like they are literally they're charging
3759280	3763520	hundreds and thousands of dollars for something that only costs a couple dollars to to make
3763600	3769040	there's anyone should be able to do that it reminds me of a cold open of the golden girls
3769040	3774480	i just watched where Sophia comes in and she's carrying like three bottles of plastic bottles
3774480	3780080	of water and she goes here taste this taste this and they all taste the water they go how does it
3780080	3785680	taste i don't know it's like it tastes like the water is like is it good yeah yeah it's good it
3785680	3788800	was like well then we're gonna be rich because i just got out of the hose in back
3788800	3796800	thank you for being a friend travel
3799760	3808080	you're a handy person and you're also a confidant guess it would have taken too long to rhyme
3808080	3818400	that and if you had a party and everybody you knew was there there'd be a big box from me
3818400	3825520	and it'd be bigger than everyone's box and when you open it up there'd be a smaller box
3825520	3834320	because i'm Damon Lindelof all right now do and the note would say now do uh perfect strangers
3834320	3849600	oh standing strong with my stranger and friend all day long this friendship doesn't have an end

4225280	4232240	it's a half hour we didn't get paid anything to write that alan thick probably bought a house
4232240	4237760	with his different strokes lyrics money and their shitty lyrics it's a catchy song it was
4237760	4243520	blared over loudspeakers into the proletariat's brain for eight years so we can't really actually
4243520	4249600	know if it's a good song or not if alan thick had to have a soundcloud account then we'd know
4249600	4257760	what he's really made of oh fuck that's scary yeah hey everybody it's alan thick i'm coming at
4257760	4262000	you on the soundcloud i don't know how soundcloud works do you yeah do you do a soundcloud id
4262720	4270960	hey everybody it's it's dwayne soundcloud coming at you uh partly cloudy chance of sound
4270960	4280880	here's my latest uh experiment with uh garage bid uh oh we can wake up wake up wake up wake up
4280880	4288960	wake up wake up wake up boop doop doop doop his name is dwayne you don't have a soundcloud
4288960	4294400	that's crazy i ain't got no soundcloud that's nuts i ain't got no soundcloud i ain't got no
4294400	4303200	soundcloud let me tell you what day sound comes in a cloud for real god turns his back on this
4303200	4313200	country and i'll tell you what else uh they tell me they tell me uh oh sir it's her name is
4317520	4324320	alexandria cortez sorry i was just like hooked on that thing where he like did you see that
4324480	4328880	clip where you all right whatever i'm not dragging i don't know what you mean the president the nazi
4328880	4334240	president he had this rally a actual nazi rally in the middle of the country and was like hey
4334240	4338800	what about these chicks that are like from little different places with their cheekbones and everyone
4338800	4344080	was like fuck them burn with the steak and he was like i love it and it was like it was fucking
4344080	4349680	insane because it crossed a huge threshold the people i'm i i know everyone understands that
4349680	4354160	it's fucking like more insanity but do you really understand the threshold that we really crossed
4354160	4360480	because pre when previous to this anytime anybody was like trying to like be an apologist
4360480	4366800	for this openly fascist slide we're taking the way that they would apologize for it would be to go
4366800	4374160	um hey uh i worked i have a friend who worked for the clintons and you have no idea man they're
4374160	4378640	no better or they're like hey what was obama's thing or any better and it'd be like all these
4378640	4387040	things that i it's like okay i like that was the bent of it was like hey it's uh it looks like a
4387040	4393680	little bit like a fascist coup but uh but what do you mean that last thing wasn't fascism come on
4393680	4400560	obama had those drones um and this was like an actual crossing of a threshold where he was like
4401360	4410240	these elected officials in my country that i won an election in that i have no reason to do
4410240	4417680	anything about unless of course the actual structure of the way things work and maybe it
4417680	4424320	doesn't work for me that good these ladies represent this thing and they were like invalidate
4424320	4431600	them make them not citizens take make them go away and he was like worse than i'm gonna say it
4432800	4439760	hitler would have been like yeah yeah yeah and he was like i love it like he's just lazy and
4439760	4445600	cowardly about it and then two days yeah it was like the the the cowardice is the fucking worst
4445600	4450960	part of it there i forgive the americans in the audience who got caught up in a thing look i this
4450960	4455920	podcast has been around long enough that we we could draw the parallels we were in chicago and
4455920	4461760	a dear friend of mine who remains a friend of mine to this day i like like said the n-word because i
4461760	4465760	asked him not to say the n-word so he thought it'd be a funny joke to say the n-word and in response
4465760	4471680	to him saying it maybe due to some fucking zeitgeist of energy about people being afraid of their
4471680	4477040	freedom of speech being a crowd of people in an amphitheater burst into applause for the n-word
4477040	4481520	i don't i don't i doubt all of those people were racist and i don't think i'm better than them and
4481520	4486640	i don't think anybody's worse crowds are allowed to act like fucking animals that's what they do
4487360	4496400	like it is a fucking horrible un-american thing to incite that energy and then do nothing nothing
4496400	4501440	at all it would be more american to fucking own it and go like yeah you heard me because then at
4501440	4506800	least you could be like oh yeah he he was caught up in it too he was a little bit american he's a
4506800	4514160	fucking lazy napping child having a dream about eating his own shit and like the only thing more
4514160	4520320	dangerous than anything is anything with a loaded gun that doesn't know it's loaded like he's so
4520320	4525680	fucking dumb and cowardly and lazy that he's going to destroy us all anyways so i i just here you
4525680	4532480	know to add to that if you want like something that really creeped me out uh as i watched one
4532560	4538560	of nancy pelosi's gets put out this awesome documentary about going on the press tour with
4538560	4544960	george w bush it is really good and it's like all these jaded reporters and they're cool though and
4544960	4549680	they're just like he's full of shit he's full of shit and then like they're filming george w bush
4549680	4559600	and you see man he is so charismatic like he is so incredibly weirdly charismatic that in a weird
4559600	4566160	way he's like it's like i'm watching it like holy shit man that is some crazy magic he's doing he's
4566160	4572160	like you know he's like just winning everyone over everyone's getting won over by this like
4572160	4579680	incredible weird texas illuminati charisma thing that's like radiating out of him you don't want
4579680	4583760	to like him you know see i don't know how many people he ended up killing or being part of killing
4583760	4588160	but what i know the civilian casualties what a hundred thousand in iraq or something but i know
4588240	4593680	like he's like you know he'll just he's like uh yeah see these boots these are they go up here
4593680	4600160	you know because uh snake bats they're pretty bad i'm gonna kill i'm gonna kill a hundred
4600160	4607280	thousand people and it's like you know it's like whoa he's but it it at the end of this press tour
4607280	4612960	he says this thing to the reporters he's like you know i don't appreciate a lot of what what you
4612960	4619120	said about me in the press but i i respect all of you as people and i was like i i was like that
4619120	4623280	that's gone that used to be that used to be part of the fucking i mean i guess we've become our
4623280	4628160	dads maybe because now i don't i i can't tell the difference between like like oh old people
4628880	4635200	get old and then they go you know what you used to call boring stodgy stuff uh now and then you
4635200	4639600	just start deciding well that's across the line but i don't i don't think that's the case i believe
4639600	4645200	we're in a constitutional crisis because i believe the previous to this the the fucking left
4645200	4656080	and right margins contained um uh things like the the the the right for a fucking free press
4656080	4660560	and and an actual need for them like there was this tradition and it was actually part of what
4660560	4664480	disillusioned us i think is because it felt rhetorical because well if you really believe
4664480	4668880	that then why are you why are you acting the way you act why are you bombing this country
4668960	4676640	and then sitting at this correspondence dinner and saying uh uh to quote uh jfk uh the the press
4676640	4681440	is right to to defy me it was more of the but you know it was all so rhetorical feeling and it was
4681440	4685280	like oh this all means nothing and i think that's part of the excitement when someone goes you know
4685280	4691760	what is it me or is all of this just a bunch of poopy doopies and everyone's like poopy doopies
4691760	4695280	and they're like like let's see if it is let's find out if it's poopy doopies and then the
4695840	4700240	and then everyone's like it's not poopy doopies you will report to detention at once and then
4700240	4707440	they're like what if we didn't poopy doopies and it's a fucking crisis because it turns out
4708160	4712800	ain't no reason it ain't poopy doopies or and there ain't nothing to make anyone go to detention
4712800	4717520	and it was actually we were we were actually being held together with the fucking weird compulsion
4717520	4722800	for rule of law yeah well you know that creepy thing in the home and like there's that great
4722880	4729520	movie funny games where you know what i'm talking about the original or the the american i thought
4729520	4734000	i thought you were getting game game night wrong no no no i thought you were like my parents are
4734000	4740240	like that movie funny games is awesome home it's about these two kids show up and they're weird
4740240	4745200	and they're they're causing problems oh that oh god that's yeah such an assault but you don't
4745200	4749120	want to believe it you don't want to believe that you're getting home invaded so you're kind of like
4749120	4754080	okay okay well maybe you guys are just a little off and by the time you're like tied up with your
4754080	4759760	husband whose knee is being broken and then and then you know you realize like oh fuck i got home
4759760	4763440	invaded like this is really happening yeah and then you're supposed to spend the rest of your
4763440	4767680	short life as you're being dumped into a pond with a cement block tied your neck you're supposed to
4767680	4772560	sit there and wonder your dying thought is should i have clubbed a random child in the head as soon
4772560	4776720	as you shown up on my porch i guess i should have been really very hateful and mistrustful that was
4776720	4781600	my big mistake was trusting people oh gosh darn me i guess that's why i'm dying a horrible death
4782160	4787280	like that's the horrible thing about evil is the way it spreads is like really should have
4787280	4791040	it's like i'm not touching you i'm not touching you you know anybody that's like been in a car
4791040	4798240	with kids knows like what that antagonism has its own sentience it's like like like are you
4798240	4801840	getting mad are you getting mad because there's no wrong answer to that question you're either
4801840	4806160	going to let me keep fucking with you or you're going to blow your stack and prove that i should
4806160	4810160	have been fucking with you well cowardice you can't be like p it's not some people i think
4810160	4815280	confuse their their their cowardice with benevolence and it's not you're not benevolent you're just
4815280	4821360	afraid and usually the the situation is when you're afraid to just cause for a confrontation
4821360	4826960	like they're saying now people watched epstein flying all these underage kids to his island way
4826960	4832160	after he got convicted there's a you know news report like the people are like we kept seeing
4832240	4837600	them with these kids and it seemed really bad nothing happened they didn't they they they're
4837600	4844080	they're something i think in a in a person in general gets feel so little sometimes are so
4844080	4850400	insignificant that you don't want to fight back and so that's we know what fosters all of the
4850400	4856160	horrible shit that's happening is like in these closed systems where your job's at stake you keep
4856160	4861920	a secret and then you're there's blasphemy that can happen in the sense that if you say the thing
4861920	4867840	about the person who's supposed to be okay it could destroy oh my god it could destroy the
4867840	4874000	business a family a you know a religion or whatever it's a sensible person does nothing
4874560	4879200	but yeah that's what i'm saying yeah i'm not being ironic saying that it's like a sensible person
4879200	4885200	does less than a less reasonable person well you were saying antagonism has like its own
4885200	4890720	sentience or spirit in the same way this level of i think um turning your back on a thing even
4890720	4896640	though it's clearly happening right in front of you it has its own spirit too and and when you
4896640	4904240	realize that there's people who literally thrive on that reality and not not exploit it i mean this
4904240	4910640	is like a con artistry is find a person you know they want to be nice that's the first mark against
4910640	4915200	them is like oh shit they're just afraid and they think they're good people so i'm going to come to
4915200	4920800	them i'm going to like hypnotize them get them invested in whatever my bullshit is and then i'm
4920800	4925520	just going to you know turn them into my slaves humiliate them take everything from them and then
4925520	4929360	by the time i'm done they're going to pretend it didn't happen because they're they're from the
4929360	4933840	midwest or whatever you said they didn't want to be rubes so they're going to ignore that they even
4933840	4939280	got fucked with and then that's what produces the situation i think where people that take over a
4939280	4946880	cool party by doing a bunch of crazy fucking shit um they had nothing to lose they were not
4946880	4951840	the cool person at the party so kicking over an ashtray jumping off the roof in your underwear
4951840	4959280	into the pool like it causing the cops to get called like it didn't those people they don't
4959280	4968160	take risks they only enter win-win situations they they flow to the lowest point of of human
4968240	4974000	pathway where they're like well actually that was like when when when this shit bag was was was
4974000	4979920	running he was constantly um uh blowing that horn because he would go i don't think i'm gonna win
4980560	4986080	because probably everyone else is cheating but if i do win it's because i'm awesome
4987600	4991760	and it was like like oh are you sure you don't want to cover a couple more bases you fucking
4991760	4996240	three-year-old like really you don't want to stick your neck out a little bit like as much
4996240	5000320	as you did when you tried to sentence five black kids to die in the fucking whatever man
5000320	5003840	all right i'm done i'm done i'm done i'm done i mean it's not it's not like we all know the
5005040	5008720	he's going to win again i'm trying yeah yeah we don't have to we don't have to bum people out with
5008720	5012880	that i and i didn't he was gonna win the first time he's going to win the second time there's
5012880	5017520	no fucking reason to doubt that there's no fucking reason this stuff is only valuable to us
5018160	5025760	in as much as it uh causes us to have conversations that you know i obviously you guys
5026800	5031920	have more than enough people talking to you about everything that's going on and like i i'm not the
5031920	5038560	person it's not that's why i've been more and more quiet about politics uh with every passing uh
5038560	5044080	episode because it's like i'm not helping by talking about it and um i had a driver in canada
5044160	5050800	in canada in saskatchewan which is like like the oklahoma of canada uh it's it's very rural it's very
5050800	5058000	like red statey like if you know like that's the comparison to like like it's they hate justin
5058000	5067200	judo our driver nice guy funny guy he said yeah he said i want to shoot him shoot judo yeah and
5067200	5071680	i said well you sound like you're from texas he goes yeah but in texas they let us they would
5071680	5079200	let you have guns like like they hate justin judo because he's the he's the liberal smart guy
5079200	5084720	that speaks three languages and is charming uh like it's fucking nasty everywhere you go
5084720	5091360	and the idea that you don't think that trump will win again is crazy well you know uh i think
5091360	5096800	you're probably right um and i'm sorry were you about to make another no no the end we're all
5096800	5101840	going to watch trump get a fucking second term because there's no reason to assume otherwise
5101840	5106640	but that's a i don't want to let you go on that but but like that's but you can say that in a
5106640	5112880	positive way like like like like we we we we all get to vote our conscience this time around
5112880	5117840	like we don't have to like let's not get sucked into the game of like uh made possibly like
5117840	5123120	yelling at our friends about like well you know if you don't vote for fucking generic uh johnson
5123120	5127600	then we have no chance of winning it's like it might be an invitation to for people to explore
5127600	5133840	new ways of thinking but yeah that's what you're saying that's what i like uh uma
5133840	5140240	thurman's dad a lot of people don't know here we go robert no i'm glad we finally got on this
5140240	5145040	get to the conversations that that's what it took us an hour and a half when we finally made it
5145040	5150160	there are dads like this really amazing buddhist scholar named robert thurman and he's like best
5150160	5154480	friends with the dali lama and he's written a lot of great books on uh buddhism and politics
5154480	5159840	and buddhism and activism because people don't realize that the the two go hand in hand but
5160400	5166400	i was so i love that he named his kid uma because he's so buddhist his kids named him robert he
5166400	5176800	became a buddhist and his daughter uma actor well he his he was saying that we can't get cynical
5176800	5181520	like uh it right now is the perfect time to get super cynical and if you get super cynical you're
5181520	5186880	gonna get shut down if you get shut down that's exactly where they want you because they want
5186880	5194160	cynical pessimistic shut down people who get so gloomified by the current political system
5194160	5199280	that no one votes you just give up and not just vote in the in the big elections but just vote in
5199280	5205120	local elections and get really involved in in your community because you can pass stuff
5205120	5210080	at the state level that creates at least many force fields to in some way or another i mean
5210080	5214560	if that shit's not more important than the fucking dumb reality show at the top
5214560	5221120	then we wouldn't be alive right now and the guy at the top wouldn't be focusing his fucking nuclear
5221120	5227440	dip shitness on local representatives of fucking neighborhoods where they were unduly elected by
5227440	5233280	their own constituency who probably look and think like them like like like it is because
5233280	5239440	the whole shtick of thinking locally acting locally is so it is the huge threat you can't
5239440	5245680	you can't stand at one of those rallies and make everyone in portland um stop making their own
5245680	5252800	cheese i ran out of ways to everyone go make their own cheese i don't i don't like that that
5252800	5257840	the those representatives are like look at the inverse relationship they have they represent
5257840	5264800	something no pun intended like there and and it's it's a it's drawing a thing from that party
5264800	5271040	they're going here's our strategy because we have no opposition on the left um in terms of like a
5271040	5278000	mecca godzilla to our godzilla which is actually a problem for them because if people get fatigued
5278000	5283280	as they very well might of a fucking autocrat they might just actually find it more appealing
5283280	5288640	for a jimmy carter to just step up and be like hey i like the taste of fucking graham crackers
5288640	5295360	and milk i don't need any more of this shit i'm fucking tired god damn you wore out my racist bone
5295360	5303840	um i i i didn't tell my mom i pretended i voted for trump but i i secretly voted for jimmy carter
5303840	5310480	because i'm tired of being racist i got so racist last eight years it hurt anyways but uh um like
5310480	5315680	that is why because they you could his instinct everyone's like oh it's a distraction for the
5315680	5320080	abstein thing that guy's never done delayed gratification in his life like he doesn't he's
5320080	5326160	not like oh i think i'll think one thing and not say it um he what he's doing is very organic and
5326160	5332400	natural he's like i only understand fighting and he's only like joe biden's not worth fighting if
5332400	5339440	he fights joe biden he looks like a fucking dummy he's gonna be like oh sleepy joe it's gonna it's
5339440	5344880	only gonna inflate and so he's like these socialists these women of color like he want
5344880	5354240	their whole camp like is going um these faces this identity politics is powerful it can displace us
5354800	5361360	and so that's uh that's an uplifting thought they're scared of it they believe that uh
5362480	5367920	one skywalker can blow up a death star they are very worried about it yeah i i that's i that's
5368160	5373520	i mean that's my hope i that's always been every that's what we hope for for sure yeah i i i went
5373520	5380160	through a real shitty like dark cynical period and then realized i'm like oh this is one of the
5380160	5383920	great things about being married my wife was like you know you're 100 wrong about all your political
5383920	5389600	predictions because i've been like just like making pretty she said that to you yeah and i
5389600	5393200	i realized that like yeah a couple years ago i've been like i've been wrong about literally
5393200	5397920	everything to realize that like you don't understand geopolitics i don't understand
5397920	5402640	geopolitics it's not i just don't know that doesn't mean we shouldn't interact with it
5402640	5410080	but the thing i at least have been trying to do is like in my own home try to not bring that shit
5410080	5416880	in there and then uh this guy choking trump orempeche says that if you want to like change
5416880	5422320	society the way you're you're gonna have to do it is maybe the isms will work like maybe we can make
5422320	5427120	find a socialism that works a communism that works a capitalism that works a little elon musk jism
5427120	5433760	maybe jism always works baby always works you gotta pop those musk balloons yeah don't pop
5433760	5437520	don't wait you save them yeah don't pop the balloons are there to protect them from the
5437520	5442240	vacuum of space but no the balloons are acting like an airbag keep the jizz in the musk balloon
5442240	5447120	if you don't want to form a lethal cum cloud around the earth it'll instantly disperse in
5447200	5453360	a spherical pattern it'll block it'll block vitamin d you're one of those musk jizz hoarders
5453360	5457920	that wants to keep it in the balloon i'm saying let's disperse the musk jizz i would like you're
5457920	5462640	a party man but we're thinking about the end of the world you got to get those jizz balloons down
5462640	5469600	in your bunker wait no special occasion pop those jizz balloons right now but that's i think there's
5469600	5477920	a that's the you see i'm gonna pop the balloon man you guys deflected uh you you you you guys want
5477920	5483200	to keep that's your problem ducking you want you want to keep the jizz inside the balloon sure
5483200	5489920	it's why because it came from elon musk's dick yeah but you know but what if you had thomas edison's
5489920	5495360	jizz i would i would pop that balloon too you would have made the worst mistake of your life
5496000	5500160	you're gonna pop a balloon you're one of those people that wants to hoard jizz balloons
5500160	5505440	of geniuses and you want to hoard genius jizz and balloons i would like the woolly mammoth to come
5505440	5510640	back right but you would keep it in a balloon and not not you wouldn't you pop that Jeff the whole
5510640	5514800	point of putting elon musk's jizz in a balloon and launching it into space is not so that it
5514800	5523280	surrounds the earth elon can surround the earth with jizz from home we need to get his jizz out
5523280	5530000	get his jizz out of orbit where it can pop around venus for instance so you want to pop
5530000	5533840	the balloon eventually well the balloon i hope will pop on its own okay that's that's all i'm
5533840	5540880	saying all i'm saying but you want to be outside and it starts raining musk jizz i i i want it to
5540880	5550560	rain genius jizz all over my face what do you think this podcast is you've been you've been
5550560	5555520	living in your own paradise this whole time you're soaking wet baby
5562720	5567360	um i did not to drag it back to the less fun thing and i'm not i'm not i'm not i'm not doing
5567360	5570960	that entirely i want to actually just get the one fruitful thing out of that because what you said
5572000	5578640	suggest that one thing which is it we can it's like it's that it's the whole awareness thing
5578640	5583440	and it's this idea of like oh i'm wrong i'm wrong about everything like like it's and it's okay to
5583440	5587840	be wrong which is like that's why i was like those people chanting the thing at a rally like
5589280	5592640	who cares they're a crowd that changes something at a rally the customer is always right they're
5592640	5597600	americans they have freedom of speech they're allowed to have a fucking weird dumb joke get
5597600	5604080	out of control we're not we they don't need to be rounded up and investigated there's a fucking dude
5604080	5609360	right up there in a system that we designed for that purpose who has a chance to react to it and
5609360	5616080	chooses the worst fucking possible path through that interaction and and so our way of fighting
5616080	5622400	it uh in big air quotes is like is actually just being like oh what did i learn from all of this
5622400	5628640	shit last couple years i am for me using my i statements of like i learned that i had a huge
5628640	5637760	intolerance for being out of control for like like i like i you know like just like it boy was
5637760	5644400	i like fucking addicted to like controlling the fucking world it was crazy how unable i was to
5644400	5650720	handle the concept that that that shit wasn't gonna go my way tomorrow and like i like i only
5650720	5656800	got a teaspoon of it and i reacted in a way that made all of the women in my life all of the people
5656800	5661520	of color in my life frankly which i like like they're like welcome to the party and it was like
5661520	5665520	okay that's good because when that line is set in die hard marks the beginning of an alliance
5665520	5674240	that saves nakatomi plaza and sometimes it has to start with a dead body breaking a windshield
5674240	5677840	of a guy that just wanted to have twinkies and i know it's confusing because i'm actually the
5677840	5686560	black guy in that metaphor i don't know man like you know i i want it to be great you know i love
5686560	5692800	the idea of like yeah we can all i love that i'm gonna stay optimistic all the way until i'm getting
5692800	5698240	my head chopped off and thank you very much put on a pike set on fire i mean i just want to point
5698240	5702880	out though the the smattering of applause you get when you praise optimism it's from a bunch of
5702880	5711920	optimists you're right they're easy clappers that's we've always known this people they're
5711920	5720000	easy clappers yeah there they go there they go easy clappers but hey you can still you
5720000	5725200	get your optimism doesn't mean being weak or optimism doesn't mean having to be all like
5725200	5731680	flowery and full of shit or whatever it's like you can you can optimistically you know that's
5731680	5738160	that great book man search for meaning by victor franco where he's like in oshwitz and like within
5738160	5746560	that situation he still finds a way to maintain a belief in like humanity as being a positive plus
5746560	5751280	beautiful thing on the planet even in the midst of all that so if he could do it i'm certain that
5751280	5758880	that we can do it in this insane revolting and turbulent weird time right now it's just
5758960	5763680	it i think for me it just means like i can't do anything about those fucking rallies
5763680	5767680	like i can't do anything about that i can't do anything about i kind of hope you'd try
5767680	5773680	i mean that's the whole it's as simple as biological physics like that's what a cell
5773680	5781040	any membrane is it's like this uh biolipid uh what's bio fuck i forgot the goddamn it's
5781040	5785840	like like cell membranes are just made of a thing that is it likes water on one side and it hates
5785840	5791280	water on the other and it naturally forms a membrane around a thing it's like it they
5792160	5798400	need to have their rally not sorry to interrupt but i just like like like if i was sorry i
5798400	5802880	interrupted you didn't even interrupt i don't know i mean i was like desperately searching for
5802880	5808320	some like nice cap on the shit when it's like i don't know man this stuff happens super fast look
5808320	5812960	what happened in iran it can happen just like that and all of a sudden everyone's getting arrested
5812960	5816960	and the next thing you know shit's on fire and you didn't do anything is what were you gonna do
5816960	5822080	anyway and you're fucked i mean really if you look at taiwan as an example of what you're supposed
5822080	5826960	to do and then look at us you see like the difference like they understand it enough to
5826960	5832240	know oh we're gonna get out there and we're not gonna sleep and we're gonna get shot in the face
5832240	5838560	and we're gonna like get beaten by thugs because we so don't want to have our freedom encroached
5838560	5846000	upon any more than it already is and we're kind of like uh well as long as no one's racist yeah
5846000	5851280	well yeah kind of i mean yeah because we haven't but we haven't yet hit that point you know terence
5851280	5854880	mckinnon said that thing where the apocalypse is already happening it just hadn't gotten to the
5854880	5861280	united states yet it's like when it's when it finally comes then then you know people tend to act
5861280	5866720	because i i do have this fantasy of like shit if we all just did go like yellow vest or whatever
5866720	5871840	and we really did it and we went into the streets and we're like yeah we don't want it anymore and
5871840	5877680	we really started like setting shit on fire and really like doing what you're supposed to do when
5877680	5882560	things are really bad i think it would change really it would change pretty fast well yeah if
5882560	5887600	everyone did anything yeah it changed real fast yeah but that but that's to me that's like if if
5887600	5894080	like you're a lion tamer and and human like all of us as a whole are the lion then you want to keep
5894080	5898720	the lion entertaining i guess you want to keep it active but you don't want it to remember what
5898720	5904560	it's a lion and we went because the moment that happens and people remember oh if we organize
5904560	5910400	and take to the streets shit changes fast it's all over for them usually it's like a bad thing
5910400	5916560	but if you can keep the lion just you know pissed off give it a couple of swipes let it growl here
5916560	5922480	and there but mostly keep it kind of sedated and busy typing and looking at its fucking instagram
5922560	5928640	or whatever then you can just do whatever you want to the lion you can fuck the lion you can
5928640	5935840	milk the lion for its sweet jizz and add it to your weird gross semen balloon collection
5935840	5940480	and then jeff will come over and pop it i got everybody light everybody lights up when we get
5940480	5947920	back on that track they're like come on get back to that thing and the cynicism is like what caused
5947920	5952000	all the problem in the first place this hopeless sense of cynicism which is like nothing i do is
5952000	5956640	going to matter it's all the same if everyone instead of doing that we're like i'm going to do
5956640	5961680	the best possible thing for the situation none of it would have devolved but it had done people have
5961680	5966400	thought that for like hundreds of years and it created this untenable situation yeah cynical
5966400	5970720	thoughts are there and they should be acknowledged i think that's a huge lesson that we that we
5970720	5973680	learned and i was resistant to that message because the last thing i wanted to hear
5974640	5978720	after the day i learned that i didn't control the world and then i had backed the wrong horse and
5978720	5984560	that it was good you know it was like i was so fucking sick of the fucking think pieces about
5984560	5990400	you know i forgot the rust belt but we what we did forget was we forgot we forgot that every single
5990400	5995840	person was like it yeah we did we did enter a world where we're like actually like you know
5995840	6000880	what there's such a thing as dismissible people and we that was working for us economically
6000880	6005600	up to a certain point and then and then it and and then it became a thing that you could launch
6005600	6010720	a platform off of some fucking dude was like oh all this fucking human flotsam you can actually
6010720	6017040	turn that all into one big mac anyways i'm mixing metaphors or maybe not i don't know much about
6017040	6024560	big macs but the um i do think that yeah cynicism doesn't need to you don't need to choose between
6024560	6032400	being cynical which is the the fucking belief that things are going to tend to go from high to low
6032400	6041440	hot to cold yeah like like like cynicism is reality tragedy is a thing that is where the
6041440	6048480	cynicism causes the inaction but it's like yeah we we you it it the the people that
6049920	6054160	the people that are trying to trick us into thinking you have to choose between Pollyanna
6054160	6059840	and nihilism um are they don't have our best interests at heart because we've been living
6059840	6066000	this long by finding a way to split the difference we know goddamn well that life doesn't mean shit
6066000	6072160	and but we are here because uh people that had bleaker lives than we did um
6073360	6081680	like grabbed their fucking bayonets blenders uh particle accelerators what their weapon of choice
6081680	6087680	in the war against chaos and they found order they they yeah there's a lot of delusion to being
6087680	6094080	a human you're like we're fucking monkeys that talk it's not worth much if you really think about
6094080	6099600	it which we're the only animal that can and so we shouldn't and it's like it's a fucking bummer and
6099600	6106000	so we make up stories and and sound clouds and stuff to cope with it it is it is crucial to find
6106000	6113120	that middle ground that to to refuse the temptation to someone telling you no at the end of the day
6113120	6118800	you're either this or you're that that's the sign of somebody that's probably trying to trying to
6119760	6126320	box you in and you can have joyful cynicism like the idea like cynicism is so fun like when you
6126320	6133360	hit a nice cynical pitch and you're really just fucking just slashing the throat of the world and
6133360	6137920	as long as you just can really enjoy it and recognize like this isn't all that i am but
6137920	6143600	goddamn if i don't have a nice throbbing vein of cynicism pumping through me at all times
6143600	6148800	you get to have your cynicism and you're right when son so when a son of a bitch
6148800	6155040	at some fucking yoga studio tries to like get you to overcome your cynicism like it's bad or
6155040	6162560	something fuck that that's the devil like you start calling yourself yeah well it's gonna cause
6162560	6168160	yeah don't listen to him you react and this is the most uplifting thing about humans is that you
6168160	6173680	react to that with fury yeah if you're feeling like self-loathing or there's these things that
6173680	6180400	we label as unhealthy and you're like you say in front of a yoga guy um i'm so such a piece of shit
6180400	6184160	i ate a philly cheesesteak last night i shouldn't have done that and like like the kind of people
6184320	6194320	like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa stop stop stop everything think different it is the good part
6194320	6199440	of every american that's like no stop stopping stop telling it just let this play out it's Archie
6199440	6203680	bunker it's Cartman it's gonna fucking flow like lava make a mountain and change the landscape like
6203680	6209120	what like let it be over if you truly believe it's like fruitless like i'm not suggesting we go into
6209200	6216400	the streets and take care of my fatness with the final solution i'm momentarily running out this
6216400	6222880	fucking lobe in my brain that's like i'm a piece of shit i fucking fail and there are ways to like
6222880	6228880	grab the person next to you when they're you know cody's in that space right now her dog is
6228880	6235120	fucking terribly ill and she's she's she's she's she's she's in this awful place and it's like
6236080	6242080	it's almost it's like a drug trip coaching kind of thing where i'm like i'm she probably
6242800	6246400	this probably isn't working but like i i'm always saying to her like
6247920	6253920	you can feel that feeling just don't you just don't act on it it's it like it's just like
6253920	6258800	yeah it's like like don't argue with people that they're not feeling shitty because then they're
6258800	6264160	like fuck you i definitely know i am like you're full you're horseshit you're well yeah because
6264160	6269360	people don't want it like you want to one of those liberating things i figured out well
6269360	6274000	i didn't figure out so it's a i think it's a buddhist idea something chugging chumba talks
6274000	6278000	about a little bit i think this is a safe place for you to just take credit for it okay i invented
6278000	6282640	this i came up with a thing called buddhism it's pretty fucking cool four noble don't don't call
6282640	6288480	it buddhism you're just gonna get caught up in court for five thousand years it's this idea of
6288480	6295520	like uh sometimes things just suck and that's it so instead of trying to put lipstick on the
6295520	6300240	suck or trying to like put a little wig on the sock and you're like yeah you know like i learned
6300240	6305920	so much from um getting one of my balls chopped off it was really a great true story all that
6305920	6310480	stuff it's like which is okay to do it's not to say that you you don't learn from your trauma or
6310480	6315840	whatever but a lot of times you'll get around these like trauma cops who when you're finally
6315840	6320000	getting to the point of overcoming the guilt you're feeling about being angry whoever the
6320000	6324960	the thing was or whatever it was and you're finally feeling this pure anger someone will
6324960	6332000	come to you and be like but maybe you should you know zoom out a little bit from the anger and
6332000	6338400	just understand that there's a way to really love the whatever the fucking thing is you know you
6338400	6347680	could just truly and it's like no fuck that it sucked period that's it i had two whole balls yeah
6347680	6354000	i had two i know i'm half as many i had one mom gone dad gone you know what i mean we're gonna
6354000	6358080	lose everyone everyone's gonna fucking die and for real gonna die and they're gonna die before
6358080	6362160	you expect them to you're gonna get a phone call and the person's dead before you expected it
6362160	6365920	it's not when you think and you're gonna die before you expect and the way you die is not
6365920	6369840	the way you thought it would be like in the movies where you look like you look like you
6369840	6375920	just got back from the gym or some shit and you fall asleep no you're gonna become a drooling
6375920	6382320	doddering thing spinning through time sweating profusely confused like i think i'm awake what
6382320	6387600	where's danny should we go to the car leasing station or whatever you're just gonna fucking
6387600	6395280	croak and that sucks period just accept that that sucks for me that's been the most liberating thing
6395280	6401360	to be like oh yeah it does just get to suck and then within that somewhere there's a sense
6401360	6406800	of like i think i can fucking do this optimism shit but i can't do it without the suck first
6406800	6412560	i'm hungry for it now exactly exactly i smoked the box of cigars in the closet of like i think
6412560	6418720	there might need not be a god like you can't just force feed people like like like over and over
6418720	6422160	again like no no don't let that in your head well that's called you know that's what they call
6422160	6427760	spiritual bypass so it's it's ideas like it's basically like if i put on an outfit like i
6427760	6432560	graduated from college i graduated from college but first you have to go through this like
6432560	6441280	just a real swamp of like not good and not not good not like movie not good or not not good where
6441280	6445120	there's like gonna be a thing at the end of the not good where it's like oh see now we did we did
6445120	6452000	it and now the puzzle pieces fit no it just isn't good and that's it and it doesn't get better it's
6452000	6456240	actually called hopelessness and it's really one of the most beautiful things ever to finally
6456240	6461760	become absolutely hopeless because uh that means that you're not torturing yourself anymore with
6461760	6467520	a fantasy of the way things could be that's pretty great and i advise it uh for anyone to become
6467520	6476480	absolutely completely hopeless well because that's where optimism starts optimism grows
6476480	6480480	from the soil of hopelessness in the most beautiful way because if the universe exists
6480480	6485680	and it was created by a any kind of sentient deity can you imagine how hopeless that motherfucker
6485680	6491360	must have been in order to create bother to create hope out of thin air like that must have
6491360	6499280	been a sad piece of shit like like who's like like like oh um genuinely absolutely 100 positive
6499280	6502880	that there's no meaning to life at all because here i am and there's nothing if i don't do it
6502880	6507360	and they're like i think i'll fuck with that because they want you to hope i want to create
6507440	6514800	the idea of uh mortality right is that that's that's and so and so you're hopeless he's a serial
6514800	6519680	killer your hopelessness is your atonement with the with the cosmic entity it's like whether if
6519680	6524720	you're an atheist then that means nothingness your hopelessness is you aligning as raccoons
6524720	6531760	and drafts cannot no matter what they tell you your sentence allows you to align with
6532320	6539440	the unliving impersonal cosmic bulldozer that was so selfish and shitty and scared and
6539440	6547280	that it made the universe you use those moments when you're when you've got that that gun in your
6547280	6552400	mouth and you don't know who to talk to and stuff it's like if you can just scrape that bottom of
6552400	6558960	the pool and just come back up in due time just don't do the permanent thing don't don't do the
6559040	6562000	thing that you mean are you talking about suicide don't kill yourself
6563040	6567600	yeah that's an easy stance to take isn't it well well i mean yes and i know like don't do the
6567600	6575040	permanent thing but the other for me like the i think suicide um is man it's a gamble because
6575040	6580480	you are i thought i really just had the easy point of view on this no i'm saying like kids
6580480	6584640	if you haven't contemplated suicide you know i would be that would be surprising to me so any
6584640	6589040	i think anyone who's sentient and experiencing suffering and wants to find exits that's the first
6589040	6594800	thing that pops into your head so i've thought about it a lot and uh my conclusion is oh well
6594800	6601600	it's uncertain about what happens upon extinction like for example if we knew that we somehow had
6601600	6606720	some way to really show sentience is based on neurobiology and when you kill yourself there is
6606720	6612960	a pure extinguishment of all identity it kind of like what dawkins calls death is the anesthesia
6612960	6617680	that saves us from the pain of eternity stuff like we get fully put under if there's no coming
6617680	6623760	back he's um not the band doc oh i'm like okay all right well i gotta i gotta revisit my
6623760	6626320	dawkin dawkin you've never heard that dawkin song
6627520	6633840	fucked up god damn dawkin time warriors i i have to go back and re-listen to dawkin
6633840	6639520	before they're uh but you're assuming oh street three soundtrack they they all right continue
6640480	6646320	to me it's like what if you kill yourself and the momentum of the pain that you're experiencing
6646320	6653520	that drove you to do self-violence continues into some uh liminal bardo state and that momentum
6654080	6657920	brings you into another incarnation and then you're just in this never-ending cycle
6657920	6663280	so it was a failed attempt it didn't work so it doesn't it didn't solve the problem and so to me
6663280	6668160	that's a good that that definitely has kept me from i guess that's an interesting like kept you
6668880	6673600	killing myself it's a it's like jesus fucking christ do you know when you jump out the window
6673600	6679040	and you're like fantasizing like maybe when i jump out the pavement turns into like a lake or
6679040	6683920	something and i dive into nothingness how do you know you don't just suddenly come to
6683920	6689840	and you're driving like a metro bus having a deja vu or the nature of time and consciousness is
6689840	6694960	so variable that it's the moment that your skull impacts with the pavement that actually gets
6694960	6701600	protracted into a subjective eternity yeah like exactly some like yeah infinite ketamine like
6701600	6706640	agony moment that goes on and on and on you the point is we just don't know and and because of
6706640	6712480	that it seems like or what i've been taught is it's better to work on extinguishing the illusion
6712480	6717520	of the identity rather than the physical body because the physical body is actually a secondary
6717520	6721680	consideration i wish we had started here instead of almost ending here because this is such an
6721680	6727600	interesting thing maybe maybe we both just got too drunk but uh the because what i would want to
6727600	6734320	add to that is i'm you're that's very interesting and clever to come up with a logical reason not
6734320	6742800	to do it but i see as the big problem is the search for logic and then when people feel like
6742800	6751120	they lose their logic they feel then tempted it's the pain of of directionlessness
6751120	6756880	and like uh just that emptiness where where you're like well i it hurts and i think that's
6756880	6763440	a really interesting thing about humans is that our neutral guilt gear gill holy shit we're almost
6763440	6771680	done folks i our neutral gear is painful to us if we're not engaged we're actually feeling wrong
6771680	6777600	we're feeling eaten alive by like these weird cyber christ nano insects from lawnmower man and
6777600	6784720	like um like just just watch it in mosquito coast that's your uh oprah oprah list the so so
6784720	6791360	i just like like i i definitely lost the power to articulate what i'm saying but like i it is
6791360	6796960	interesting to be like hey man don't kill yourself because you never know it's also like it's more
6796960	6802480	important like to me to be like yeah you never know so don't kill yourself i know that sounds
6802480	6807680	like the same thing but like i i just like it's a feeling it's a it's always a feeling
6807680	6813600	that's the weird thing about humanity is there is no logical reason to stay alive there is only just
6814560	6821360	just hanging out and it it it's that it's that belief that if something doesn't make sense it
6821360	6827760	shouldn't exist that can be fatal for kids who don't have an experience yet with like
6828320	6834320	oh shit sometimes shit just is super dark and confusing and then and then all of a sudden it's
6834320	6839600	not and they don't know that when they're 16 and then they do the they do things that any
6840160	6844480	human can do they have the power to do things that you'd never do when you were 40 just because
6844480	6851200	you've experienced more 16s by then you've been like oh yeah this too shall pass and and i and
6851200	6855120	so there is this wisdom even though it sounds kind of provincial it sounds like your your old
6855200	6862640	dottery guidance counselor but it's it's just like just don't act on anything that you're only
6862640	6868240	feeling it doesn't your feelings aren't valid is is that a common thing that you think about or
6868240	6873760	is that something that just comes up once in a while the idea of like of like offing yourself
6873760	6878880	like oh i i i used to get depressed i haven't gotten depressed in quite some time thank god
6878880	6883360	but i used to get like severely depressed and part of that is like intrusive suicidal thoughts
6883360	6893120	but he'll be thinking about it next wednesday night in a cage with uh elon musk for real like
6893120	6898880	our our friends keep uh killing themselves like our our funny friends keep dying i'm not gonna kill
6898880	6903840	myself good don'ts please and no i'm no i'm not i'm this it wasn't but you said but that's actually
6903840	6909360	a thought that you like like like runs through your brain oh god i would i love i really love
6909360	6914160	being alive and i wouldn't i like i i used to have depression i don't now but i and i and it
6914160	6918720	recurred through my i thought about it too i think it's important for people to go like it's a thought
6918720	6923760	how did you go from being uh thoughts of depression and to not being depressed like what was the
6923760	6930000	transition for you jesus it was a long fucking fiber journey it was my fiber journey you should
6930000	6935440	read my book it's on amazon i've read i've read your fiber blog fiber cured my depression fiber
6935440	6941680	enemas spencer you got thoughts it was quinoa it was quinoa yeah it's a combo of quinoa and fiber
6941680	6948400	and just like a basic like i i i rub fiber into my prolapse in the morning and it just like makes me
6948400	6954400	no no i i that was not that just so you know and thank you for asking that not was that not a cry
6954400	6959200	for help it wasn't there's not a secret thing underneath it or like i i really like to be alive
6959200	6964240	i i don't have any desire at all to no longer exist i have this beautiful son and a wonderful
6964240	6971760	wife i love to exist i i like it so much but i do think that depressed people uh they even that's
6971760	6976720	this what is a psychologically documented thing which is intrusive suicidal thoughts become
6976720	6981600	shameful you know you're like oh my god my brain spit out this horrific way of doing things and
6981600	6986160	then you feel embarrassed about it because you're like you don't want to talk about it and also you
6986160	6989840	don't want to talk about it and then you kill yourself but then you're like or my but you're
6989840	6995680	thinking like shit man i must be so crazy that i'd want to do that when and i really do mean this
6995680	7002000	is not i'm saying the instinct to kill yourself is actually more of an instinct to move beyond who
7002000	7008000	you think you are you're just desperately trying to solve the problem of this micro this hardcore
7008000	7014080	compression into your identity and so uh this which is why i one of the things i've heard is
7014080	7018480	before you reject yourself you need to know yourself how can you reject yourself if you
7018480	7025200	don't know who you are and so the idea is to first prior to any kind of horrific solution like that
7025200	7030080	see if you can figure out what you actually are and in that exploration it's really cool because
7030080	7034560	like literally everything in the material universe if you zoom in on it far enough
7034560	7041600	it disappears similarly the identity itself if you spend any time analyzing and deeply looking
7041600	7046960	into it you will begin to notice the most beautiful terrifying and ultimately liberating
7046960	7053680	thing happens which is you as you thought you were ceased to exist and you didn't have to jump
7053680	7058480	out of a building for that to happen and somewhere in there i think is something quite beautiful
7058480	7065840	and uh a far less destructive solution for your community and and i think there's some compassion
7065840	7070880	there too there's something really sweet about being in all that fucking pain that you get into
7070880	7075600	when you're depressed beyond pain you wish you were in pain you wish you were sad anything to
7075600	7083600	not just feel that numb dead entropic miasmic paralysis you would give anything just to feel
7083600	7089280	a moment of sadness and somewhere in that there is something so sweet and beautiful about still
7089280	7094960	finding the strength to stay alive because you know the people around you would be so devastated
7094960	7100320	to me that is a really beautiful thing and that is a reason to stay alive and a logical reason to
7100320	7105040	stay alive aside from the fact that when you kill yourself a hundred percent of the time
7105040	7110640	you wake up and you're having a deja vu as a metro city bus driver a fucking cliffhanger
7112320	7121680	junken chaso thank you thank you Duncan it's been a long day thanks for spending your monday
