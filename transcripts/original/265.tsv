0	9240	Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know where you are tonight, but tonight we are in Harmontown.
9240	17440	Let us waste no time in bringing up the stars, the mayor, the alderman, the corrupt council
17440	27440	people, first to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon, you know him, you love him, God bless
27440	28440	him.
28440	29440	Thank you.
29880	32280	You also know him at Spencer Crittenday.
32280	35440	If you don't know him, I don't know what you've been doing.
35440	36440	Here he comes.
41440	46440	And are we going to bring up the most illustrious, most beautiful Steve Levy?
46440	48440	No, let's leave him out there for a little bit.
48440	49440	Yeah, that's what I thought.
49440	51440	That's the name Steve Levy.
51440	52440	Welcome.
52440	53440	Welcome back to Harmontown.
53440	54440	Thank you.
54440	63040	We are back at our old home, but we are not violating any permits that I know of because
63040	64040	there's no audience.
64040	67040	There's like 40 sewing machines out there with people at them.
67040	69720	People don't know about this, but other than that, we're good.
69720	74280	So I thought, yeah, it wasn't really working in the VO booth.
74280	75960	We could go back there when we wanted to.
75960	79960	It was more the tech kind of, was more challenging at the booth, right?
79960	83920	Because we have this whole kit and caboodle that we then have to fit into this tiny room
83920	86560	that's also set up for its own recording stuff, right?
86560	92640	Yeah, we do have so much more equipment than the booth can make useful.
92640	98640	And the equipment was used with subscriber money to try to make the show better for subscribers.
98640	102120	They're the people that we really care about, even if there's a lot less of them.
102120	108080	We love our free listeners, but we want to impress the subscribers.
108080	112360	And when we move to the booth, it's like even though those people probably are kind of irritated
112360	116920	by the live audience sometimes, it's like, eh, you know, we really miss that stage.
116920	118520	So we figured it out.
118520	119880	We figured it out.
119880	121600	There's no more ingredients missing.
121600	123720	No, no, it's perfect.
123720	128240	The audience is missing and it's no, I wanted to do it.
128240	131480	Did you ever hear that Andrew Dice Clay tape the day the laughter died?
131480	136000	No, I please or like a Neil Hamburger thing or like, like, like, like there's something
136000	142240	really fun and wrong and painful about like just format performances.
142240	143240	Right.
143240	151040	In spaces where there's the glaringly missing thing as an audience reacting.
151040	155960	And I just wanted to see if that would like what that did to my energy and stuff.
155960	162560	So I now there's no jealousy, which is great because there's always a little bit of jealousy
162560	166440	between the people who live streamed and watched it and those people who had to wait and then
166440	167440	just listen to it.
167440	168440	Yeah.
168440	169440	Who knows what relationship they had.
169440	170880	We found out our numbers were wrong.
170880	171880	Yeah, we were wrong.
171880	173800	It turned out it was fake news.
173800	174800	Yeah.
174800	175800	What?
175800	178320	We shouldn't have trust Steve's numbers when they came from Breitbart.com.
178320	184560	We started, uh, yeah, we shouldn't go to ear wolf, uh, ear wolf's news site for our, uh,
184560	185760	for our podcast numbers.
185760	187280	We thought we were tanking.
187280	190720	Um, it turns out Ockerman's just on a war path.
190720	196080	Um, I got, he spent eight hours golfing with the Japanese prime minister today.
196080	199000	Uh, I still don't believe that hair is real.
199000	200000	Ockerman.
200000	201000	We have beef.
201000	202920	Um, is Ockerman still ear wolf?
202920	203920	No.
203920	204920	Okay.
204920	205920	But you know, who is ear wolf?
205920	206920	I think is maybe Brandon.
206920	208560	Don't you have an ear wolf podcast?
208560	209560	I do.
209560	211520	I had, I don't know if we got renewed or, oh, okay.
211520	212520	It was a seasonal.
212520	213520	It's a really sore subject.
213520	214520	Oh, I'm so sorry.
214520	215520	I'm kidding.
215520	216520	I'm kidding.
216520	217520	I'm not, I'm not sorry.
217520	218520	I was kidding.
218520	224160	I thought, I thought Ockerman was still at ear wolf in a capacity because he has a couple
224160	225160	shows, right?
225160	228520	I think he does his own shows and I think he might be like a consulting producer or
228520	231560	something, but I don't think he's evolved in the day to day that he used to be.
231560	237640	I think he was like one half step ahead of me in trying and trying what I have now tried,
237640	241200	which is like, I kind of got into bed with Farrell and like, I was like, like, let me
241200	243100	help this.
243100	249880	Now we know the truth, the podcasting industry, he's, the stakes are not high enough for any
249880	252200	kind of satisfying competition.
252200	253200	Don't worry.
253200	254200	We're all friends.
255200	259040	It's, it's, it's, it's just like, it's a, it's a, I don't know if you call it a buyer's
259040	263680	market or a seller's market, but it's just sort of like, you know, it's, if you're podcasting,
263680	269440	you're doing it for funsies, I think, unless you're like my favorite murder or it's like,
269440	277320	it's like a sea of, of, of, of, of gold panners, man.
277320	281080	See this is where the audience would bail me out that they'd be like, Oh, the word gold
281080	282080	reminds me of something.
282080	284360	They'd be like, Oh, you fuck you guys for talking.
284360	288560	Uh, no, but, uh, anyways, I don't want to talk about the podcasting industry, except
288560	292120	to say, if you have a podcast out there, we, we, we love you.
292120	293120	Wish you luck.
293120	294120	Uh, it's a great medium.
294120	300240	I actually do have a great podcast recommended, uh, um, in the, in the vein of like, I mean,
300240	304480	there's podcasts that you listen to because they're organic and anything can happen and
304480	305480	there's no preparation.
305480	310320	So you might accidentally listen to two hours of a, of a horrible windbag, just like trying
310320	311320	to find his way.
311320	314360	Um, and I can recommend some of those to you too.
314360	319800	Um, but, uh, there's all, then there's the produced ones, you know, and I, I, among them
319800	320880	are true crime ones.
320880	322400	There's true crime ones that are sloppy.
322400	324400	There's ones that are good and bad because of that.
324400	327520	I just listened to the, is it a crime city?
327520	333240	That's the one that, um, the guy that did the jinx, um, is doing, um, or, or has done
333240	338640	two years ago and I'm just finding it now, but, um, uh, it's, it's a really like super
338640	344200	produced podcast series about, um, Providence, Rhode Island, which is like, I didn't know
344200	347960	it was like this super mobbed up town.
347960	353360	It's like the third, you know, most mafia city after New York and Chicago, but it's
353360	355520	like the tiny, it's a tiny little, I don't know.
355520	359160	No, spent a little time there, buddy CNC, very corrupt politician.
359160	360160	It followed.
360160	364200	It's a really interesting, I mean, they really, this is amazing story because they are, they're
364200	368120	able to tell the story of Providence, Rhode Island and its relationship with crime through
368120	375400	the shoes of its own mayor who, who, who runs as an anti-corruption, anti-crime Republican
375400	381800	candidate ends up taking democratic help from, uh, uh, the mob and it's just great.
381800	385920	It's that thing of like how, how dirty are you willing to get to clean up your town?
385920	388160	So is it like a one, one shot story?
388160	393520	It's not like, uh, like, uh, it's not like, it is, I mean, I assume, I don't know if it's
393520	397120	like the wire, like they'll finish the, then they do a different story and then they'll
397120	401560	be like, also Providence had a problem with its water treatment plants and everyone will
401560	403800	go, where's Stringer Bell?
403800	408960	I just listened to this podcast called a crazy, no Dirty John and it's a similar, it's a six
408960	414400	episode, one shot true crime podcast that makes you hate old people.
414400	415400	That's what it did to me.
415400	416400	Oh God.
416400	419400	I mean, well yeah, I bet that was, uh, I listened to that.
419400	420400	Oh boy.
420400	424600	Dirty John was, uh, well cause the mom is subjecting her children to extreme risk.
424600	426720	It's like the, the depths you must sink.
426720	427960	Like I don't want to get too spoilery.
427960	428960	That's the thing.
428960	431620	But like the depths you have to sink to like do that to your family.
431620	437920	It's like, that's what I hate about old people when you're doing it because you're lonely.
437920	438920	That still sucks, right?
438920	439920	Yeah.
439920	442360	No, I mean, I'm sure Donald Trump is lonely when he doesn't have money.
442360	443360	Right.
443360	447200	And she was like, she was a victim of domestic abuse and bad relationships it seemed.
447200	451320	So it's like, she's, you know, she has like, not like she's sick or whatever, but she's
451320	452520	kind of in the cycle.
452520	457560	So it's like not all, you know, she's, she needs help too, but it's still, I mean, you
457560	458560	gotta watch it.
458560	459560	I, or listen to it.
459560	460960	I listened to it in one night.
460960	465400	Um, yeah, you can listen to it on 1.5 speed without losing any quality.
465400	466400	So do that.
466400	467400	Yeah.
467400	472240	Have you, have you listened to this one, uh, uh, up and vanished?
472240	473240	No.
473240	477160	This is guy, this kid that sounds like Chris Pratt and for the first, the first episode
477160	480800	is him explaining he doesn't know how to do a podcast and then he calls his grandma for
480800	481800	help.
481800	485580	And it's a, it couldn't be more like, if you, if you hate, if you wanted to create
485580	492160	anti-millennial propaganda, it's like, he's just like, he's just finding his way and we
492160	496080	can make fun of him because the guy's probably a billionaire now cause it's like a hugely
496080	497280	popular podcast.
497280	502120	But he's just like, yeah, I really wanted to do a true crap podcast cause I like listening
502120	503120	to them.
503120	507280	And so then I, I found myself, you know, I picked a case and then I was like, wait, doesn't
507280	508280	my grandma live around there?
508280	510640	And then he calls her and the time.
510640	514400	And then like they talk about it for a while spoilers for the next five minutes, if you're
514400	519400	going to listen to 900 episodes of it, cover your ears, I'll be really quick, uh, goes
519400	526160	through the thing, um, like, just like basically, um, kind of just casts the same aspersions
526160	530300	that the public's been casting on Reddit onto the usual suspects who, you know, helping
530300	533560	drive that like, you know, shame onto their life.
533560	536240	And then a random dude comes forward and says, I did it.
536240	540560	And then the rest of the podcast is him advertising a tour he's going on and doing interviews
540560	546120	with people about his podcast and whether or not it helped.
546120	553080	Uh, but, uh, missing Richard Simmons podcast.
553080	554080	Yeah.
554080	555240	I mean, it's, it's better.
555240	556680	It's better for people.
556680	561600	I'd rather live in a world where people just had access to shit and we're just trying shit.
561600	563720	I want to know what are good numbers.
563720	564720	What are bad numbers?
564720	565720	Since we, we know the numbers.
565720	570480	We don't have to say your numbers, but it appeared that we lost 80% of our listeners
570480	571920	ship.
571920	573440	It turned out that wasn't the case.
573440	577440	The reason was, is because we were looking at, apparently someone started using a different
577440	580080	tracker for the, for counting.
580080	583600	I have no idea how this works, but in effect, they split the numbers down the middle and
583600	588140	we were looking at it's like if you hired someone to watch numbers and then two seconds
588140	592560	into the job, you fired him and then assume that that was the numbers for the whole thing.
592560	596120	And it turned out you hired another guy, but you didn't know his numbers.
596120	598140	That's basically what happened.
598140	601580	But it was a good chance for us to realize we give zero fucks.
601580	604100	Yeah, that was the conclusion we drew.
604100	605740	I mean, we're not too bummed.
605740	608660	And not in a punitive, aggressive way for you.
608660	611860	Like obviously I'm here and I'm excited mostly about you.
611860	615420	And so is Chris Peruff, our director and Zach, our audio guy.
615420	619220	Like we, we, we, we, it's you that we really care about.
619220	621940	I'm pointing at the camera for you shitty audio listeners.
621940	625180	Sorry, I'll tell you guys later during a me and these commercials that I love you more
625180	627620	than them.
627620	630340	But no, there's no acrimony here.
630340	632300	This is the experiment that I wanted to do.
632300	637260	I'm gesturing like a, you know, between me and the camera because it, because I always,
637260	640860	you know, it's just, it's just part of my like weird, can you monetize the internet
640860	641860	hobby?
641860	647700	The only answer so far being, you know, yeah, if you're, if you're, if you're Mark Maron,
647700	652660	if you're Mark Maron or porn.
652660	654700	But I want, yeah, anyways, I'm not going to bore you with that.
654700	658300	I'm going to bore you with other shit.
658300	666220	So listen, you guys, a huge, huge mass shooting today.
666220	667820	Yeah.
667820	669940	Don't be desensitized to it.
669940	672180	I know you think the world record was broken.
672180	674140	They've subdivided them into categories.
674140	680500	Fox was all about, this is the biggest church shooting in 20 years.
680500	683540	Just look, yes, go numb.
683540	684540	Don't go so numb.
684540	686740	You stop watching television about this.
686740	690300	The records are still bound to be broken.
690300	695020	The magazine industry for a while was just time, life, and then they had to fragment
695020	697580	into Ninja Quarterly and stuff.
697580	698580	Let's look at church shootings.
698580	701820	This is the biggest one in 20 years.
701820	709300	And oh, that Chelsea Handler, you naughty girl, you didn't wait long enough to say Republicans
709300	710300	are bad.
710300	711300	You're so naughty.
711300	713700	That hurt me.
713700	717220	I hope it's clear I'm being sarcastic.
717220	722340	It's crazy how people have paid attention to, they know now, the details before the
722340	723540	news even really reports it.
723540	725460	So they knew that he wasn't a Muslim.
725460	727220	They knew that he wasn't black.
727220	728860	They knew that he was from the United States.
728860	733620	He was probably a member of the community because the news reported it like a shooter.
733620	737300	And just now, just saying a shooter makes everybody know, fuck.
737300	739780	It's funny, first of all, how that was noticeable.
739780	744860	It's funny, second of all, how I was like, those are the details I wanted.
744860	746380	What color was he?
746380	747380	What is this about?
747380	753100	Which of the Lord of the Rings factions, you know, is this in service of, there's no factions
753100	757820	in Lord of the Rings, it's two factions.
757820	758820	Game of Thrones.
758820	761780	I didn't want to say Game of Thrones.
761780	763580	Mafia, good fellas.
763580	764580	He's right.
764580	765580	Yeah.
765580	768460	But it's like, why do I want that information anyway?
769460	773820	As a church shooting, I was like, please don't let it be 26 black people shot by a white
773820	784100	dude because, but then again, then your brain gets divided down the middle and now you've
784100	792460	become like some weird fucked up twin sociopath because neither of you has a soul anymore
792460	797780	because one of you is still making calculations like, well, at least it was a white guy because
797780	803220	if it wasn't, that would be even worse for some Rube Goldberg society machine.
803220	808260	It's like, why, when did I get tricked into hoping different people were dead or alive
808260	809260	in the first place?
809260	812220	Let alone what religion they are, what they were wearing on their head.
812220	814980	Why am I hoping this is a redneck?
814980	819460	Because I do think that the first thing you think is I want to know who and why because
819460	820460	I want to know if I'm next.
820460	821460	Yeah.
821460	823420	So I think that's like a natural place to go.
823420	825780	We feel like we're taking a temperature.
825780	829980	We feel like these news stories that are, they feel like we're watching a, like our
829980	833300	country has the flu and we want to, we want to know.
833300	836420	It's like when I get too high and I start checking my pulse.
836420	840900	It's so stupid, but it's just a, it's just like, and even one time I was at the emergency
840900	844180	room because I thought I was having a heart attack in my twenties and like the dude set
844180	847020	notice that I kept checking my, he said, can you do me a favor?
847020	848020	Stop doing that.
848020	849020	Like, well, why?
849020	850900	Well, cause you're pushing down in your carotid arteries.
850900	852780	So you're really fucking up the data.
853500	855860	What are you going to do if you notice your pulse stops?
855860	857020	You're going to call a doctor.
858820	860300	Also, like you're not going to pass out.
860380	864660	I drove all the way to a clinic because I got too high, jumped in the car, drove to a
864660	867100	clinic and was like, well, I'm having a heart attack.
867420	868420	I'm having a heart attack.
868500	871580	And then right before I got out of the car, I was like, you don't have insurance, nigga.
874180	876420	And that sobered me right the fuck back up.
877420	881660	I, you mean like that your focus went off of your diet onto your finances.
882460	886540	Yeah. Even if you die, it's better than going in there and creating like a $2,000 bill.
888140	888940	Got no way there.
888940	892780	You're like, I got to eat less lasagna.
894460	895460	All right. Whatever.
896900	898220	You're right. That is where we are.
898220	902980	We are at this point where we hear bad news and we definitely break it down to its core
903180	905260	so we can figure out whether or not we need to go get that go.
905380	910060	Not only are we doing, but really it's like this guy who's sitting on his couch,
910060	911540	checking his pulse because he got too high.
912140	915500	That guy isn't prudent.
915860	917420	He's not health conscious.
917660	919700	He's not. He has no plan.
919740	922900	And he doesn't really even want to go to the hospital on top of everything else.
922900	926620	He's not even committed to hypochondria because the reason he's going like this is
926620	930100	because, you know, the alternative is you just go, well, I'll just go to the hospital
930100	937340	just in case I'll just risk, you know, bankruptcy or, you know, I'll put myself out
937340	940500	there. I'll put more energy into something than my anxiety.
940700	943900	But it's like, so we're just we're in a hammock of anxiety right now.
944060	947500	We got too high on, let's say, capitalism.
947500	948500	I don't want that.
949300	954580	And now we're pushing down on our carotid artery with the fingers of xenophobia
954580	960100	and white guilt and pushing and pushing and waiting for the right signal through
960100	964540	those fingertips to do what something dig a bunker.
964580	966900	What am I going to think it's supposed to rationalize?
966900	968220	And then you stop freaking out.
968220	971700	Like, that's the hope. You're like, oh, it turns out he was a bad person.
971780	973700	I'm a good person. I'm fine.
973700	974660	I don't have to worry.
974660	976980	You know, I think that's what's, quote unquote, supposed to happen.
976980	978420	But it doesn't really work.
978420	981940	Yeah, I think we're also hoping whatever the process is, it'll take four years.
981940	983780	Right. And we did it.
983780	988860	We're a quarter of the way there because then we could just pull that lever so hard.
990500	993740	And yeah, it also has something to do with the fact that I don't know.
993740	996740	I remember when those beheadings started back in the I think it was even
997060	1001500	now after 9-11. But, you know, the old days,
1003020	1004940	that guy in the orange jumpsuit, you got his head cut off.
1004940	1006900	I talked about in the podcast before I was like, I did.
1006900	1010540	I haven't done it since because fucking ISIS got way too good at cinematography.
1010540	1012580	And I knew I wasn't going to.
1012580	1016740	But it's like when back then, when when radical
1016740	1020660	like terrorist groups were like doing beheading videos,
1020820	1024980	it was always like all fucked up and like some weird Fisher Price pixel cam
1024980	1027980	and they do some weird alpha mat on it to disguise their base.
1027980	1031660	But it would be like a dude hovering in the in a cookie cut out or whatever.
1031860	1034500	And I always like like I would click on that stuff
1034900	1037420	and it did have something to do with wanting to know.
1037420	1040020	I have no idea what data I would get from that stuff.
1040140	1044700	Something to do with coping with death, because what could be a worse nightmare
1044700	1050860	than you're doing, you're some civil engineer or something and you're overseas
1051540	1054660	and you get pulled into a I mean, it's that thing where you realize
1054660	1056540	it can happen to anybody. Yeah.
1056540	1060460	And then you start we start coping with strangers deaths on the Internet
1060460	1064580	by going, OK, God damn it, there's a reason this wouldn't be me.
1064580	1065780	There's a reason. Yeah.
1065780	1069140	Or there's a reason why when this happens to me, I'll know what to do.
1069140	1071540	Or there's a reason why
1071540	1073300	when it happens to me, it won't hurt that much.
1073300	1074740	Like, I think that was part of I watched it.
1074740	1077260	I watched a beheading video because I think I kind of wanted to know.
1077540	1081860	I wanted to see or hear some primate impulse that that made me go.
1081980	1085740	Oh, I bet it doesn't even hurt that bad after the first.
1085980	1087300	What'd you decide?
1087300	1088780	Looks like it looks like it's bad.
1088780	1090260	Looks like it's a bad way to go. Yeah.
1090260	1092540	I don't even think they're using the right tools for the job.
1092540	1094740	Well, yeah, their audio was out of sync. Yeah.
1096500	1097940	I don't even have a bounce sheet.
1097940	1102060	But then ISIS started doing fucking iMovie and it was like, this is so unsettling.
1102060	1105020	Yeah. But they're little like they're they're clearly and they're like,
1105060	1108500	I mean, even the name ISIS is so much cooler than the past Taliban,
1108500	1110260	like like the past terrorist names.
1110260	1113740	It's like the name that we used to put terrorist organizations.
1113740	1114620	Yeah, literally.
1114620	1115660	Also, it was Archer.
1115660	1117820	Remember Archer was battling ISIS.
1117820	1118980	I think they were ISIS.
1118980	1120100	They were ISIS. I don't remember.
1120100	1124220	Actually, I have I had a bunch of Archer gear because I'm a super, super nerd.
1124580	1127060	And I can't wear any of that shit because it had ISIS all over.
1127060	1128540	They ruined. Yeah.
1128540	1130020	Yeah, fucked up Archer.
1130020	1132300	Well, if you're in ISIS and you're watching.
1133380	1135540	Leave us alone.
1135540	1137340	Your job has become so easy.
1137340	1140540	Although I got to say we are really outpacing ISIS at this point.
1140740	1141660	It's this.
1141660	1145500	It feels like it's scarier to be in the United States
1145500	1147380	than it would be in the Middle East at times.
1148020	1152340	Yeah, I mean, it's yeah, I don't know what the statistics are, but I know for sure we.
1152340	1154540	Yeah. Yeah.
1154540	1157060	I do know that a kid stands a bigger chance of getting killed,
1157060	1160620	like in a poor neighborhood in America than they do in the Middle East.
1160940	1163140	Has always been like one of those weird statistics.
1163140	1164660	Yeah. Well, you got it.
1164660	1166140	Yep, we did it.
1166140	1167060	We did it.
1167060	1171380	I always I get so terrified when I look at like Middle Eastern statistics
1171380	1174340	and like low rent Eastern European countries,
1174340	1178500	because I know that rich people look at those statistics or look at those facts
1178500	1182340	and they they go like, oh, well, you know, like it's it's like,
1182340	1186060	well, it's like when you get a job and you're you don't like the job.
1186060	1190420	So you like start like you're showing up late and then your boss yells at you.
1190420	1193100	And there's like a tinge of like, oh, no.
1193100	1196340	But then you find you keep finding your limits.
1197140	1201940	And it's like, you know, that like the the monopoly guys running things,
1201940	1206260	they look at us, maybe I shouldn't say us, maybe I should say you.
1206260	1210620	And like I'm just like a piece of privilege driftwood
1210620	1213860	like floating like slightly on top with Trey Parker or something.
1213860	1219060	But but but I they look at the sea of taxpayers, voters,
1219060	1220340	whatever the fuck they see us as.
1220340	1223060	And they go, these people are so spoiled.
1223060	1225140	They don't know how good they have it.
1225140	1228180	Like in Czechoslovakia, they blah, blah, blah.
1228180	1229340	And it was fine.
1229340	1232980	And in in Iran, when a woman blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1232980	1237460	And it's like, you know, that they're just go they're looking at that with chaching.
1237460	1240140	Yeah. Oh, god damn it.
1240140	1244180	It's what the market will bear idea of like, yeah, you know,
1244180	1246500	make sure everybody gets a couple of gap sweaters.
1246500	1248020	Don't take away their gap sweaters.
1248020	1250260	If you do that, they will riot.
1250260	1254180	It's that idea of how much can you take before you really start to get upset?
1254180	1256220	I thought we had a much better threshold right now.
1256220	1258420	It feels like, damn, we can take an awful lot.
1258420	1260900	Yeah, I think cell phones really change it a lot.
1260900	1264500	I think we could slide right into the fucking shitter, man.
1264500	1270500	Like, like we we we we're not we we we we we had got nothing to fight with.
1270500	1272900	I feel so vulnerable.
1272900	1275660	I feel I just like I spent all weekend is like
1276980	1279700	like just like playing Minecraft.
1279700	1283300	You know, I was about to mind holding my lover, but really, let's be real.
1283300	1287780	I was playing Minecraft, but then also holding my lover and like, like, like,
1287780	1292340	just it was just like filled with all of these like, dude anxieties
1292580	1295220	because the church shooting, I was enjoying myself.
1295220	1295980	I went to take a shit.
1295980	1298700	I look at the phone and Jesus fucking Christ, it never stops.
1298700	1301260	I don't get a goddamn break from these people dying.
1302180	1306300	And then I'm like, I was just like, I just I just I just want to be able to protect
1306540	1310420	Cody. I just I just but you can feel this very
1310900	1314860	like dark, cold, monolithic
1315380	1319020	thing setting in that is all numbness
1319660	1322100	and comfort and fear.
1322100	1328300	It's it's it where you you could feel the fringes of your empathy.
1328580	1331580	Like they're just like disintegrating,
1331580	1334660	like because the solution that we use to connect to each other,
1334660	1336540	we have these tendrils in it.
1336540	1340060	And and then if that solution is just acidified,
1340420	1343740	then like the parts of us where we're not
1344300	1348540	we all expect like this thing to be like some movie where people are turned
1348540	1351340	into something, but it's like the first thing that happens is your
1351420	1356380	your connections to each other are amputated and for survival.
1356860	1360700	Yeah. And and it doesn't even have to be a conspiracy on the part of any bad guys.
1360700	1362420	It's just like this is what's happening to us.
1362420	1365180	It's like necrotizing, like we're going numb.
1365460	1367500	We're we're we're going cold.
1367500	1371300	And we're like, and that gives way for me, like bouts of euphoria
1371300	1373460	because I think your system's shutting down.
1373460	1375420	It's going like, well, my lungs don't matter that much.
1375420	1378660	So now my brain has all this glucose left over to remember my mom.
1380220	1383220	Like a soldier in a World War Two movie, you know, when they go like it's cold,
1383220	1385140	it's dark, and then they got like this smile on their face.
1385140	1387300	They're like, give me a sheepdog, Tony.
1387300	1391180	And it's like, I bet that's based on real shit, because I bet when you're dying,
1391180	1396020	like your brain just kind of pulls back and then has these like bursts of of like,
1396140	1397540	yeah, but it's not that bad.
1397540	1399820	Like, look at Super Mario Odyssey is awesome.
1399820	1402700	You know, like I feel these waves of like, it's going to be OK.
1402940	1406100	Yeah. And it's because I'm dying.
1406100	1411780	I'm dying like as a person who like ever thought they cared about other people
1411780	1414940	or trusted them, like I'm becoming an animal.
1415180	1417740	I'm becoming a person that just once I do.
1417740	1422220	All I worry about now is like, can I protect Cody?
1422220	1426100	Can I or the last moments of my life going to be spent failing her?
1426580	1430980	And so that's that's like part of the go get a gun white boy thing.
1430980	1433220	And then I don't know.
1433220	1436620	It's like I assume the trajectory keeps going where pretty soon I'm pushing
1436620	1440620	Cody out a window or something and going lots of nutrients in here.
1442980	1445220	Because there's that noose doesn't loosen.
1445220	1446700	It's not like I'm finding out.
1446700	1450100	I care really. It's like I'm shrinking back. Right.
1450100	1453460	I'm just going like, well, I just want to be with my girlfriend.
1453460	1457820	I just want to I read a study that said people act and think
1457820	1461100	more conservatively when they feel threatened.
1461500	1465900	And Fox News is very dedicated to making people feel threatened
1465900	1466940	every day of their lives.
1466940	1470620	So it's kind of like it's this pipeline that's conservatizing people.
1470780	1474500	One of the problems is for a while, researchers had basically no way
1474500	1478820	to induce a liberalness or whatever, because you can make someone
1478980	1481380	feel more conservative or whatever, but you can't make them feel more liberal.
1481380	1484980	But then they discovered recently that if you take them through a thought
1484980	1488380	experiment where they suppose they're invincible and invulnerable
1488380	1492220	and, you know, can't be stopped by bullets and stuff, then they get more liberal.
1492220	1497300	So it's like feeling comfortable and safe makes you makes you more willing
1497300	1500460	to share and kind of be be liberal.
1500700	1503940	But feeling that you're going to be dying from terrorists and stuff
1503940	1508180	makes you want to get guns and ban illegals.
1508580	1511500	So if you wanted to self-destruct a species, you know, that's the algorithm
1511500	1514540	you'd use, you'd say, well, what's his kryptonite fear?
1514820	1516900	Yeah. Yeah, that's not good.
1516900	1521380	Lack. Like, like, oh, it's like when the people used to say like,
1521380	1523260	oh, the dog dogs could smell fear.
1523260	1528380	Like, well, he's going to have a real nose fall here because he's growling at me.
1528380	1529140	What do you want me to do?
1529140	1530940	Like act like I'm not scared of your dog.
1530940	1536340	So he likes me in a classic example is this last weekend.
1536340	1539140	Like I kind of fell for it, too, to the extent that I went through
1539140	1542860	an hour long rabbit hole, kind of debunking it in my own head, because it was
1542860	1547500	like there was this, you know, refused fascism organization.
1547500	1551740	And they they got a full page ad in the New York Times, I think.
1551740	1554460	And and then who knows what happened first?
1554460	1558740	It doesn't really matter because the Internet is an anonymous
1558740	1565340	carnival of of fear and lust and and and just the all everything
1565900	1571540	that humanity had a chance to bloom into gets sheared off
1571540	1574940	as it slides through the two inch diameter tube of the Internet.
1574940	1577020	And we're all realizing that now all too late.
1577340	1581340	We're all realizing that Silicon Valley is cigarette companies
1581340	1584900	like for the mind that they're through no fault of their own.
1585620	1588580	20 years later, they're through a lot of fault of their own.
1588740	1592420	They didn't I mean, they weren't like Philip Morris going like research shows.
1592460	1593540	Oh, fuck it. Yeah, they were.
1593540	1596540	Yeah, they were like, hey, do you want to do something about these fake accounts?
1596820	1598860	No, that will mean we get less signups.
1599380	1601060	Yeah. OK. All right.
1601060	1602860	So so I know what you're saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1602860	1607980	So so like it it's this thing happened where
1609860	1614140	I mean, me trying to parse through this, even though I'll probably get details
1614140	1618380	wrong, it's it's like it's kind of it's not me trying to report to you.
1618380	1620340	It's more me going, let me get this straight.
1620340	1622380	Is this what happened? I could be very wrong.
1622380	1627460	But it seemed like what happened is that first, the maybe the right started going
1627460	1630140	like, what's this thing? What's this refused fascism?
1630140	1631700	They got a page in The New York Times.
1631700	1636860	I got oh, and then there's like this really lame 90 IQ
1637780	1640500	false flag fliers started going out where.
1641340	1644380	But then it gets really confusing because the false flag fliers,
1644700	1646980	you know, a false flag flyer would be like if you were white
1646980	1650220	and you were scared of black panthers, you would go you would make something
1650220	1652820	that said like, you know, Huey P.
1652820	1655980	Newton says get a gun and go to Pershing Square tomorrow, you know, like
1656220	1658580	but you're white and you're doing that because you hate the black panthers.
1658580	1661340	So but then but then it gets more complicated because I don't know
1661340	1664180	if I've ever seen this before, but like it's the Internet.
1664180	1665300	So flyers are free.
1665300	1667380	You don't have to stop eating pizza to go.
1667860	1669260	We pay something on the wall.
1669260	1670700	You can just keep fucking with shit.
1670700	1673580	Add a Pepe airbrush. This is it.
1673580	1676780	And also the Antifa knows that as well.
1676780	1682380	So they're going round and round and and and it just turns into this swirl of
1682700	1686540	there's just all these fake flyers where it says, hey, Antifa,
1686540	1691060	don't forget to wear your red baseball cap and polo shirt tomorrow
1691060	1695340	so that the cops think that it's Donald Trump supporters
1696260	1699500	who are attacking when when we start raping white women.
1699500	1703140	And then the it was just like and then the like like like people would troll
1703140	1704100	and go like, yes, that's right.
1704100	1706140	We're going to rape all the white women tomorrow.
1706140	1707700	We're going to kill all the white people tomorrow.
1707700	1711620	Don't forget. And just like, but you can't you can't tell who's doing that.
1711780	1716500	I went to like three Antifa, you know, Beverly Hills.
1716500	1717580	I was like, that sounds funny.
1717580	1721300	Like I was a team of Beverly Hills fake, you know, like, like, like, like, like
1721300	1722300	everything was fake.
1722300	1726060	Everyone was faking someone else and everyone was like spreading disinformation.
1726540	1731220	And and so then the weekend happened and I was actually legitimately scared.
1731220	1733820	I thought, you know, I know a lot of this is fake, but that doesn't.
1736940	1740060	All all it took for that guy in Las Vegas to do what he did is
1740380	1743060	apparently had extra guns or something.
1743060	1745460	I don't even we still don't understand why he did what he did.
1745740	1749780	But also he was not dissuaded by the fact that it was a hunky tonk concert.
1750660	1753620	With Jeff Davis, his friend that he was shooting out instead of his original
1753620	1755380	planet like we.
1755380	1759220	So in that world, like, is there an ironic thing going on here
1759220	1762100	where if you're not crazy, but you are just filled with rage,
1762100	1764420	at least you do have like a right brain aspect to it.
1764420	1768020	So you don't do things like the Boston Marathon thing like because when you put
1768020	1770940	those things together, don't you aren't you just scared to leave the house now
1771260	1774620	because you go like, well, everyone's yelling at each other so much on the
1774620	1777140	Internet. They're like saying, I'm going to kill you.
1777220	1779900	Come get me. I'm going to I'm going to fucking kill you.
1780100	1782180	I'll be there tomorrow. I'm the sharks.
1782180	1786180	You're the Jets. And like, but then like basically nothing happens.
1786460	1791380	And then the next day, it was just like I looked at the hashtag
1791500	1795300	that they were, you know, November 4th, it begins or whatever.
1795300	1799260	And it was it was like essentially 100 percent, just like
1800300	1806260	people probably I'm guessing in not in California, like probably in
1806780	1810020	I'm not going to keep on bashing like red states like like as if everyone
1810020	1812860	that lives in a red state is like some kind of yokel or or if even
1813100	1816660	even if being yokel is a crime, if you're a yokel, it doesn't want everyone to die.
1816660	1818940	You're on my side. Yokel away.
1819100	1821820	I told you not to bring up them yokels.
1821820	1823220	I told you it's going to be trouble, man.
1823220	1827940	Well, it begs the question, can you be can you be an international yokel?
1828780	1831500	Must you be so localized in your yokeling?
1832500	1834700	You should speak with those German pants are also yokel.
1835740	1837700	What happened to the cosmopolitan yokels?
1838580	1840180	Why so provincial all the time?
1840180	1842740	Maybe that's responsible for your yokelry.
1843820	1846780	Maybe you need to get a passport and maybe you'll see.
1847380	1849900	Yokelry sounds like an old iced tea slang word.
1851380	1854780	Obviously, somebody like like like like that was just hating on locals,
1854780	1857900	which means if so if you're hating on locals, then that means you're a transient.
1858300	1860420	So you're either a rock band or you're a comic.
1860420	1864940	So someone so someone wanted to bash on whoever lived wherever they were,
1865020	1866460	which they weren't going to be tomorrow.
1866460	1873060	And they had to rhyme the word local. OK, pretty, pretty, pretty,
1873060	1876100	pretty unimaginative, Louis Anderson.
1876100	1877620	I'm sure you've made that up.
1877620	1878540	No. All right.
1878540	1882580	So but but but so then it was it was just a bunch of, you know, well,
1882700	1886580	you know, it's probably fucking Russian AIs, but I or it was whatever.
1886580	1889660	But like it's people that you're picturing because you see the American flag emoji
1889660	1894100	in the thing and you see the you see the the the little tiny itty bitty little
1894100	1898060	thumbnail with a guy you think maybe looks like he's kneeling over a bore carcass
1898060	1904020	with a fucking blow gun and and they're just they're just all patting themselves
1904020	1907540	on the back and high fiving about how they didn't show up.
1908540	1910260	Yeah, which is crazy.
1910260	1913780	So then they're like me because that means you can just we just invented
1913780	1914860	the or didn't invent it.
1914860	1916260	But that's a bunker buster.
1916260	1917980	That's a societal bunker buster.
1917980	1923940	I can now decide to take out any group by like if I if I hate Native Americans,
1923940	1929060	you know what, let's leave them for a while if if if like if I hate
1929060	1933380	like our mechanics, if I hate car mechanics, I so I could go home
1933620	1937620	and I could now just create a bunch of fake accounts and say and not even fake
1937620	1939180	accounts. It's too much work.
1939180	1940260	Just make a fire.
1940260	1945420	That's it with a car mechanic logo, a Jiffy Lube workers union with a fist.
1945620	1949620	And there's a big knife with a across a woman's throat.
1949820	1952460	And it just says, don't forget tomorrow's rape day.
1952700	1954020	Jiffy Lube style.
1954020	1955780	And then I just send it out, send it out.
1955780	1960260	And then and then I go like and then and then like I send it out
1960860	1964820	on a million channels and go like, guys, I'm really concerned about this.
1964820	1966820	Is no one finding this stuff except for me?
1966820	1967980	I mean, this is crazy.
1967980	1970020	I can't believe this is some shit's going down.
1970020	1973620	You know that 20 percent of the people are going to go, yeah, that's right.
1973620	1976060	I'm doing that. And then another 20 percent of the people are going to go,
1976260	1977980	yeah, I heard another thing at work.
1977980	1979420	And then you just wait two days.
1979420	1980740	And one of two things happens.
1980740	1983500	The Jiffy Lube people are like, these people are trying to fucking kill us.
1983500	1987580	Let's go kill them or nothing happens.
1987580	1990220	And it's a win win because you just then you just go, oh,
1990220	1991820	chicken, chicken, bak bak.
1991820	1993460	This is this is crazy.
1993460	1994740	I'm terrified about this.
1994740	1996900	We're losing we're losing the meme war.
1997540	1998700	Right. It's there's not.
1998700	2001460	I mean, it's weird to talk about it like that, but there's not really
2001700	2002700	another way to push it.
2002700	2007300	I mean, I remember in 2004, 2008, like Republicans know how to message.
2007300	2009700	They say, you know, we're going to call this free handouts.
2009700	2012940	We're going to call this not taxing not tax cuts for the rich.
2013140	2016340	And they've done that for more than 10 years, probably way longer.
2016500	2018060	But they are so good at that.
2018060	2021020	And then, you know, and then so they've evolved.
2021020	2024820	And now their online discourse is all in service of this great dishonesty.
2024980	2026540	And it just works really well.
2026540	2031180	And then on our side, we, you know, we're shitting our pants and blaming each other
2031180	2034620	and smearing the shit on the other person and saying, you're doing this to me.
2034620	2037580	And like, it's not we're losing the meme war.
2037580	2038780	It's really bad news.
2038780	2042660	You can't any time you go on in a big part of its Russia bots, I'm sure.
2042660	2047820	But anytime you go on Twitter, it's just like conservatives dominate the discourse
2047820	2051940	when, by all accounts, there's probably more liberals on Twitter than conservatives.
2051940	2054940	This is the thing that's driving me crazy, because having read Steve Silverman's book,
2054940	2056220	we had him as a guest in the show.
2056220	2062220	The only neurotypical that the autistic community says is allowed to to neurosplain
2062220	2065020	for them because he spent years writing this big, thick book.
2065020	2070260	It's a history of autism in America or its diagnosis, which starts in the 70s
2070260	2072540	because they were still cattle prodding people back then.
2072540	2076700	But the the history of the autistic spectrum in the United States,
2076980	2079620	it runs parallel to the history of the Internet.
2079620	2081100	It starts with ham radio.
2081100	2085860	It goes through sci-fi culture and all this stuff, because once upon a time,
2085860	2093340	there were people who in situations of like a party where there's like real punch
2093340	2099340	and Cheetos and like eye contact, they weren't like they weren't.
2099340	2103380	They didn't have as much going up to the plate as they did at home on the ham radio.
2103380	2105580	It's Morse code or these things.
2105580	2113100	It's like the Internet gets created on the backbone of of like the silent
2113100	2120180	minority of like geniuses in our country, people who who because they're smart
2120740	2128740	and because as Spock knows, it's more logical to just pick a lane in terms of
2128740	2132700	whether you're good or evil and stick with that and then abide by logic within
2132700	2139020	that lane and raise your eyebrow at the approach of how to protect your species
2139020	2142540	and things. But at least you've decided, yeah, but if if a human gets in a fight
2142540	2146300	with a shark, I'm not going to root for the shark because I'm not a crazy person.
2147380	2153060	The those people and yeah, that's what I mean by those people.
2154540	2160620	Those those people gave us the Internet and and it's and, you know,
2161620	2166780	in there, like 13 year old Dean Harmon's like starting to talk to people for the
2166780	2170380	first time on a monochromatic monitor and I get to lose my virginity at 16,
2170380	2172220	which is something that never would have happened.
2172220	2178580	I don't think to this day if it weren't for these like Internet chats combined with,
2178580	2182140	well, let's get together in real life at the local FUD Rutgers and let's like look at each other,
2182140	2186300	wear name tags and we can like sneak out to the car and try some stuff.
2186300	2192980	We can hack our bodies by coming with with anyone.
2193220	2194700	That's actually normal operations.
2194700	2197900	If you came fireworks, that would be a that's a real hack.
2198060	2200340	And so that's a hack.
2201620	2205380	But and so it was a place to hide.
2205380	2212100	The Internet was a place where smart people went to hide from their moms, from the
2212100	2217820	laundromat operator from who couldn't understand complex thought from from from
2217820	2223580	people who let's let's even put it even more objectively and say from people
2223580	2229300	whose IQs were distributed along different parts of different receptors and
2229300	2234620	transmitters, people who fare better at a party in a backyard in a trailer at the
2234620	2236300	bar and on a snowmobile.
2236300	2238980	I just rattled off a bunch of things that you associate with right wing people.
2238980	2242660	But I'm in a penthouse cocaine orgy.
2242660	2248060	I don't I don't know what is a left wing thing in a sushi bar and a catwalk with David Bowie.
2249540	2250340	Get him off the catwalk.
2250340	2250860	What's he doing?
2251220	2251980	He's going too far.
2254100	2257140	You kick David Bowie out of this catwalk.
2257500	2258860	It's like a CK one commercial.
2261820	2266260	So so then those and then Myspace and then Facebook and then your mom's on the Internet and then
2266260	2270340	your mom is the Internet and then they but at the same time, so is your boss.
2270380	2271420	So is your wife.
2271460	2272260	So is your kids.
2272540	2273460	So is your job.
2273500	2274700	So is your job prospects.
2275380	2280420	When I moved to L.A., you still I still I went to Kinko's to produce my screenplays like so we
2280420	2283460	shrub and I could hand them out at parties because we had email.
2283700	2287660	But it's just not how you it's like how you looked up old people, old friends and like
2287660	2289060	said, like, are you alive?
2289100	2289820	This is crazy.
2290860	2293060	Now it's just like the Internet is the real world.
2293060	2293860	I'm not telling you anything.
2293860	2294340	You don't know.
2295340	2297220	There's the world that we're in right here is fake.
2298380	2299540	That's why there's no audience.
2302860	2309060	And now it's the worst timing because we need the Hawkman and the Flash Gordon of the
2309060	2315980	political spectrum, which is the the the smart people and they excelled at the Internet
2315980	2320660	because they never had those those specific kind of like tendrils.
2320980	2326060	So their logic was like where they were actually able to say, hi, my name's Tom.
2326300	2332820	Like I'm not that good at talking at the party, but I now am good because I know where to
2332820	2333660	point and click.
2333940	2335300	Now, everyone's pointing and clicking.
2335340	2339860	That hasn't changed Tom into a social butterfly and it hasn't made him empathic.
2339900	2340140	Right.
2340740	2349500	So now you have a black woman on Twitter saying, hey, I'm mad about this and we got to do
2349500	2352700	this on Wednesday and get our shit together.
2352860	2360580	And then you have like this odd, well-intended white person going, well, I don't think that
2360580	2367660	pound for pound there's any I think technically what you're saying is as racist as saying
2367660	2368420	this other thing.
2368820	2370020	Thank you, Spock.
2370220	2371340	Thank you so much.
2371340	2373260	This is the exact right time for this.
2373260	2379380	This is perfect logic is exactly what we needed right now because logic and it's
2379380	2385420	great conveyors, the bullets, tips of spears, arrows, fire set to your home.
2385540	2389780	These things, these things that don't involve understanding other people.
2389860	2391500	Let's add to all of that.
2391540	2393020	It worked 20 years ago.
2393140	2394020	Now it doesn't.
2394140	2396020	Your mom's on Facebook now.
2396060	2397900	Yeah, she's an idiot.
2399140	2402540	She's being talked to about her all the time.
2403060	2406460	Your, your mom thinks that headlines are truth.
2406500	2407700	I almost do.
2407700	2410300	I still can't quite get past it.
2410580	2415500	There's an, there's an instinctive thing where I see like a font type that's like bigger than other
2415500	2417660	type underneath it and a byline and a thing.
2417660	2421500	And it's like designed in a way that looks like something that used to be called a newspaper.
2421500	2424900	And I go, ah, newspaper.
2425100	2433100	And then if, and then I have to then go, ah, fake newspaper, like, but, but, but like your mom is
2433100	2435180	like newspaper like that.
2435180	2437060	She never even gets that far.
2437100	2439580	And then she just clicks forward to all her friends.
2439860	2441060	They're terrified.
2441220	2442740	They're porcelain birds are rattling.
2442860	2451060	If 44 year old philanthropist genius iconoclast Dan Harmon is cradling his girlfriend with his
2451060	2456260	rippling biceps while his Iron Man Mark III suit is being assembled in the corner by Jarvis.
2456260	2457500	And I'm scared.
2457900	2459740	Your mom is gone.
2461220	2462660	Egon's gone bye-bye.
2463660	2470260	Like, like, like, she's, she's just, it didn't matter if she started Democrat or fucking like, like,
2470260	2472340	like the Jill Stein voter.
2472340	2478660	Your mom at this point is fucking like under the bed and she's, and we're, we're doomed.
2480300	2481940	Sort of, sort of.
2482300	2487020	One of the things that they are good at is the old everything sucks and here's how we're going to fix
2487020	2489540	it and everything sucks and here's how we're going to fix it.
2490060	2493300	And we are incredibly bad at we're fixing things.
2493340	2494980	We don't have time to tell you what we're doing.
2495340	2500980	If you look at what Obama left office there, everyone had to come to his aid afterwards to discuss the
2500980	2502260	things that he had done in office.
2502540	2506700	And the list is 500, 600 things long that he never talked about.
2506940	2512100	There's this crazy thing that Democrats have where they practice the humility in order to get the job of
2512100	2515100	charity done and then they don't toot their own horn.
2515340	2521260	So there's a ton of legislation that the right benefits from, but you never hear Democrats rub it in their
2521260	2521780	face.
2521980	2524620	Half you broke motherfuckers are on ACA.
2524860	2526020	You're the people on heroin.
2526100	2527380	You're the people laid off.
2527500	2529500	You're the people that this program was set up for.
2529700	2530940	The middle class is liberal.
2531340	2535900	It's the poorest of the poor that needed ACA that needs Planned Parenthood and all those projects.
2535900	2541460	But you never hear the Democrats cut to the chase and say, I'm talking to you.
2541660	2545420	I'm not talking to just one person who gets five dollar coffee.
2545660	2549820	I'm talking to your broke ass who needs things like Edd and free college.
2550340	2554260	We don't toot our own horn because sometimes we're too busy actually doing the job.
2554300	2559460	There's a little bit of hope and faith in there that says they'll figure out that we're the ones behind
2559860	2561100	these great programs.
2561180	2563340	And look, she never pushed your agenda.
2563500	2565460	The current Democrats aren't pushing their agenda.
2565540	2567540	Right now the Democrats look like they're failing us.
2567780	2569420	But the truth in the press.
2569780	2572260	But the truth is we've stopped all these bands.
2572340	2574420	We've stopped all this crazy ass behavior.
2574700	2576660	There are incredible Democratic leaders.
2576660	2578900	They happen to be female, which is why they're not getting any play.
2579460	2581740	And they happen to be African-American, Hispanic and Asian.
2581740	2582460	Gross.
2582580	2583140	I know right.
2583620	2584420	Here's the thing, though.
2584700	2589380	We do send you the people that you're thinking aren't going to be able to do the job.
2589420	2594620	One of the great things this party does is send in an old black woman to get some shit done because the Republicans
2594620	2596700	think they can defeat her and they'll be asleep at it.
2596740	2601060	So that's part of the problem is that it looks really dark.
2601260	2605180	But on the ground, we sort of know we're out here.
2605660	2610300	We're out here physically going door to door and figuring out how we can stop these people.
2610300	2613380	We may not brag about it and we may not have a marketing budget.
2613980	2617100	But the truth of the matter is there's been some heroes.
2618740	2621020	There's probably a million of them.
2621180	2628220	I mean, by definition, heroes are they're just they just end up getting suffocated.
2628620	2630780	They weren't they weren't trying to breathe, though.
2631180	2640060	I don't mean to be Morgan Freeman about it, but some of us knew that when we got on that burning ship that was was headed
2640060	2643300	towards the town, that it was going to go down with us on it.
2643620	2645060	And we don't give a fuck about that.
2645060	2645820	We don't mind that.
2645820	2652700	There's nothing more hardcore, more ride or die about saying I did this for the group and you can suck these balls.
2652980	2659180	The dude who just did it for his family and ripped off a country so that his kids could have one hundred million fifty, sixty,
2659180	2661980	seventy years from now, that's not really a baller.
2662140	2663620	That's not really a tough person.
2663620	2667460	That's not a G. A G is when you're like, I'm fucking down to ride.
2667460	2669340	I know this is going to give my headshot off.
2669540	2673460	That's some Crispus Attic shit where you're like, somebody got to start this motherfucking party.
2673780	2674940	We have those people.
2675180	2676260	We just don't talk about them.
2676980	2683100	That's the thing is that I had to confront my cowardice in my comfort level being threatened when I was like, I was like, I'm not going to
2683380	2687460	church, went and took photos at the, you know, Pershing Square and stuff.
2687460	2691780	I was like, somebody's going to set off a fucking lunchbox bomb or something.
2691780	2694900	And it's like my therapist is going, that's OK.
2694940	2695820	You're a pacifist.
2695820	2701780	Is it if you find out you're a pacifist because baseball bats come out, you're a pussy like that's it doesn't.
2701780	2704580	It's too late to find out you're a pacifist.
2704620	2705300	It's not.
2705300	2707620	It's when everyone finds out they're a pacifist.
2707980	2710700	But it's like and she's like, look, you got to stop.
2711780	2720780	You like because I was saying, like for 20 years, I talked like Noam Chomsky, you know, read half of one of his books and I'm like so left of left of left of anarchist and like
2721100	2722140	power to the people.
2722140	2723940	And there's no such thing as race.
2723940	2725620	It's just a division that's vertical.
2725620	2727900	They're trying to distract you from the horizontal divisions.
2727900	2729020	And we need to fucking like.
2729900	2739620	But really, it was a fucking dodge because it was saying I was going like, yeah, red, red election, blue election.
2740420	2746660	Wake me up when politics gets real because there's going to be people in the street beating the fuck out of each other.
2746860	2748100	That's how you know when it's real.
2748380	2752740	But by I'm going to like like I'm fucking like I was such a dodge.
2752740	2753300	I didn't know it.
2753300	2755740	But it was and it's like, no, they're there.
2755740	2756820	Dan, they're tomorrow.
2756980	2762820	People are going to get like as far as you know, you have a feeling someone's going to get their brains beaten in.
2763700	2764860	Something's going to blow up.
2764860	2765980	Something's going to get thrown.
2765980	2766620	Start on fire.
2766780	2768140	You could be there with a blanket.
2768220	2768860	Put it out.
2768980	2769820	Help the person.
2769980	2775620	You you could be the person that they beat up because you look a little bigger than the lady next to you.
2775820	2780500	You could you could you could just go there and walk the walk like what you're talking about.
2780620	2784580	For the Black Lives Matter marches, what we wanted were white people around us.
2784900	2787900	We wanted white people in the crowd because we knew.
2788740	2790580	Ain't nobody going to get killed when there's.
2790580	2797180	And when we love being a ring of white people around a bunch of black people, when it means that the black people are going to come over and play
2797180	2803860	Balderdash on Wednesday and we can teach them what a what a fucking trying to think of a mojito is.
2806020	2807060	That's not white people.
2810700	2812740	I don't know what a white what a white cocktail is.
2813380	2815340	You got a full menu and you pick mojito.
2818940	2821420	I'd love to know about these suburban enchilada.
2821460	2822700	Is that what you white people call them?
2822700	2823340	Enchilada.
2825420	2826700	A Chandler's fizz.
2827260	2828220	I had to make one up.
2828660	2830980	But but but like we don't want to.
2831180	2833140	It's not not what we don't we don't want to.
2833180	2836260	That's the other thing on Twitter is like it's like white people standing next to black people.
2836260	2842460	It's always the funniest thing when like black people are like like I you know.
2842900	2843700	Let's face it.
2845380	2845820	God damn it.
2846180	2849580	There was some I screen grabbed it because I was like this is classic.
2849580	2870100	There was like a woman of color if you believe Twitter avatars saying like something something like just it's just it's just she's just saying like you know it's it's worse on us than it is on you like like it's it's you know you liberals are all waking up to this idea.
2870100	2871260	But it's it's worse.
2871940	2885500	And then just this this fucking flood not a Nazi insight not a conservative insight not a Pepe no alt right needed just because the clot that floods to that wound was all liberal white people going like going now wait a minute.
2885540	2892780	This is not what I signed up for when I decided to care about you people like a little gratitude wouldn't hurt here.
2892780	2897260	You know they didn't say those things literally but the way they express that is just logic logic logic logic.
2897260	2905060	They go well actually I don't think that's true I think it's you know it's like we can't give them this then.
2906500	2908540	That's bad advertising for the revolution.
2910620	2913900	Truth's a power down with the thing get the pitchforks of the church.
2914060	2918220	Hey after we finish this maybe we'll have a beer together.
2919220	2920460	I don't know man.
2921220	2935980	It's like it's not a good time to you want to yes and you're throng like like that's that's how Frankenstein's get chased you know everyone goes to nobody nobody goes like kill the monster and Jews later.
2938540	2941860	Kill the monster that's a way to talk to a fellow monster killer.
2942700	2971260	You have to admit Yoshi you're you're pretty stereotypical I'm Japanese yeah there it is it's remember how fun it used to be to be dark fuck no I'm jealous for all my life tell me about it as it as oh you mean cynical cynical it used to be like fuck this fucking new taco shop yeah and this fucking
2971260	2972100	gen X.
2973020	3000420	David cross generation baby Janine Garofalo flannel shirt hands in the pockets look at the floor I don't care spin doctors don't look like kiss because we're fucking real that's right it was a blast you could talk wash our hair you could you could say I don't like this juice this juice is natural I don't like this fucking wallpaper I don't like this I don't like that if I've heard of it it sucks right good sign you've never heard of this fucking band because they meet in an alley it's only like four dudes and you don't even cut mine all.
3000460	3023380	Well I'll listen to him while you're telling me about him but if I find out someone told you about him I'm fucking I'm not gonna be your friend anymore yeah they suck now because they make money at this shit so we hate them it used to be we had a great run of that and like you said there was a ton of comics that came out of that era of being able to like really make fun of the world and where we were from a very elevated place and now.
3024100	3047060	We don't want to be dark like if that's how you made your money you're not really into like don't think suck I think it's that's how hard it is it's so hard well it starts with muppet movies frankly it starts with shit like that where it's like oh you can't hate on the muppets yeah there's a there's a hip comedy person in that movie like come on we all grew up on the muppets it's always it's always in
3047060	3077020	fantalization like oh come on goodnight moon is the bomb likely as the goodnight moon movie brought to you by general electric we make cluster bombs we also bring good things to life we'll tell you one of those two things during this production of goodnight moon with Ted Danson as the moon whoopie Goldberg as a starfish and then because you don't want to be on the side
3077060	3090120	of bad shit which the Republican right-wing the fear-mongering side the the the the Skeksis
3090120	3118120	they have that advantage they detach themselves from Gestalt they don't feel like if they make the case that racism is okay in order to get what they want that they don't worry about the like reverse Midas touch of oh I'm going to protect my daughter make sure she can go to good schools
3118120	3147960	by by hitting these talking points and these talking points it's like it's almost like that there's a linguistics is where is where the atomic fission is is the liberals think words are magic we think that if you say abracadabra and you really believe in it if you believe you're invincible if you believe that Tinker Bell can come back to life then she can but no one wants to risk anything no one wants to run up on stage and bring Tinker Bell back to life the Republican
3147960	3177880	Republicans get to go Tinker Bell is already dead who thinks that we should hang that person for doing it and it's really easy to raise your hand demagoguery I mean it worked in Rome right like it's it's a very tried and true tradition it's very effective and so it's like well what are you supposed to do when you're when when when the how are you supposed to not become the thing you hate if the thing you hate is hating you can't that's what I think I mean we I'm not saying join the hate
3177880	3207880	but like I don't how do you beat demagoguery other than being more popular than a demagogue and being all eyes isn't actually being a demagogue lame and aren't I cool and is in their parties here like I don't know there's not you can't be a spoil sport and say demagoguery sucks this demagogue is is not cool because nobody wants to be told what to do and if they you know it's like unless by a demagogue but but but the but okay I hit rock bottom I'm coming back up I'm not gonna do this to you and thank you for being here in lieu of
3207880	3237880	it's like what I'm doing is easy it's like heavy and like I curl up in a ball I suck my thumb and I sink to the bottom of the pool and I associate that with like transformation but I'm reliant on people if you were down there going like I would be like we'd be dead like I'd be dead anyway cuz it's like but you're up there going like yeah but come on fucking float piece of shit I know our numbers are bigger
3237880	3267880	I know that there's more of us trying to save the world oh I thought you meant the podcast numbers well now that I know that our numbers are bigger yes but but but I do think I think that the key is it's like if the question is how do you how do you beat hate if if you don't want to hate it because if you hate it you hate and then hate hate hate and it spreads and then we we're also sick of hearing about you forgot the rust belt you should be friendly to a hillbilly today on the internet you should do like there's something in between there
3267880	3297520	my therapist was getting at like it it it's like we we have to we have to be ourselves even more than we thought you ever had to be like the definition of being honest what we didn't realize that it was spoiled along with a sea of like badness that we could counter by for instance in the 90s culture going
3297520	3326200	yeah but I don't want to buy prell right because it's got a logo but but like it was that easy to revolt back then it's getting harder and harder and harder to revolt against hatred that it's becoming increasingly clear that that the only way we're ever going to beat it is with genuine love and we are constantly running up against these moments anecdotally where we're
3326200	3356040	the trolls aren't smart but they because they're dumb and because we want to beat them and strangle them out of existence we just keep finding out that we are full of more hate than we thought and it's not like it's like we have to actually learn how to love we and it doesn't mean like just see some grody piece of shit that you don't like being around and pretending that you like them or respect them politeness
3356840	3383880	is a big problem right now or it's it's rather it's it's not a problem anymore because we've that market has crashed but we have bigger problems if if if we're living in the 1929 right now the things leading to it that you would be learning about in history culturally one of the things would be politeness and I I'm sorry but we were always like the road comics were always right about that that the PC thing
3383880	3413800	I know that the bad guys right now are still harping on that but PC culture we don't have the language to separate these things but the truth is we started building a we had a grain of sand in our oyster called like class ism and we started fucking swirling around in our little mucus pouch and coating it with secretions of how do you do ma'am and nice to see you and yes I believe you're an equal and now we got a big fat grody Pearl of this is a bad metaphor Pearl
3413880	3414520	valuable and very smooth great very valuable though but it's a pearl of very disruptive like it's it's a pearl so big that the oyster has burst open what is the pearl it's uh it's it's it's it's the Ragnarok okay right because the grain of sand was classes I mean it kind of just built been snowballed it's the unspoken shit that we weren't dealing with in the first place you know we went from the 70s I hate to I hate to Gen X bully everybody but Brandon and I'll tell you we had nailed it around
3443880	3466960	1979 this week crossed into the 1980s we were just about to breakdance our way into true equality it was in all the papers gangs were breakdancing to settle their disputes we had replaced shoelaces with velcro oh yeah it Michael Jackson had not yet been assailed by a conspiracy of liars now I'm kidding
3466960	3467960	what changed though because we did kind of backslide especially in TV and stuff right didn't represent like was it representation getting a lot better and then just something happened and it kind of just got set back 20 years like what happened I don't know we were first is what happened we had Wall Street crashes people were pitted against one another that had never been pitted against one another before right so at one point America you did have you did have people started to equalize and sort of make money regardless of who you were everybody was on the
3496960	3526960	up and then we broke some deals that we had which were we weren't gonna lay off the people in the middle of the country we weren't gonna do that to the manufacturing base we were gonna help those people learn computers we were gonna help those people learn automation we weren't gonna break unions and we weren't gonna take your house from you we broke those three deals which made the average American suddenly be very poor and then they were ripe for the picking we started a war on the poor in the 80s we decided to do that we decided to deregulate we decided to economically it starts with economic
3526960	3556960	policy tax breaks you know in order to do this we're gonna need to have the government not do as much okay well let's make let's let's let's just let's just have a war on the poor well there's a lot more of them than there are of us are there when you divide them up by every little tiny itty-bitty thing that you can divide them by are there really more of them no they'll let's get them back away from Archie bunker where people are talking about the shit and let's let's go right into
3556960	3586960	a writer where the black guy is talking in rhymes while you fix his kit between adventures and it's not a deliberate I'm sorry if Glenn Larson is watching and he's like god damn it that was a progressive choice they wanted that to be a big titted woman and I fucking moved society forward I'm sorry Glenn Larson I'm not I I'm sure that's true and I'm not say I'm just saying like it's kind of it's about the ethos it's like you see that happening on TV that's the only thing I know about society it's like yeah I don't know also it's an ongoing
3586960	3616960	we're paying attention to right now is the viciousness that is coming in but we're not really paying attention to how many years we have successfully held them back so if you're looking at it from I have to always remind myself from a civil rights perspective we did a great job after the 70s and we were able to hold these very evil forces back through the 70s through the 80s and then it got dicey in the 90s and now we're not all the way back but we have lost a battleground we had racism as a
3616960	3646960	thing that we had figured out to be you should be ashamed of that actually took a lot of doing you and I were both born after that transaction occurred yes like like like so we don't even understand what it might be like to be in like 1961 and be like like well yeah but black people are like different and like hating them is how I pay my rent you know like like like like a good person might be like yes feeling that way like we don't understand how that concept works because we
3646960	3676960	were born into a world where he we had decided at some summit called the fucking work of all of the civil rights movement that okay racism is officially bad the villains have shown their true colors we know how this works here we go welcome children of the 70s to the dawn of the age of Aquarius racism is bad and then we're like racism is bad which racism is bad and then our neighbor didn't return our lawnmower like that guy's racist or like it just got too comfortable
3676960	3706960	like the like it's like racism got so bad so we agreed that racism was bad to the point where idiots hateful idiots terrible lynch mob oriented authoritarianistic sheeple if you will red pillars even could just know that racism was bad and just write a letter to TV guide and call them racist when they wanted TV guide to change the way they did things and then that also coincides with that
3706960	3736960	population suddenly gets money they've been monetized since World War Two they're able to spend we realize it's a country that we can actually make money off of these people so that being racist becomes inefficient and then that also coincides with women also becoming wealthier so what what they do at the top is they sort of go look I don't have to just underpay you I could underpay your wife too and they begin to split us and neither one of us are doing better and what do you guys got kids whoa would you do that for exactly why you go make another American for
3736960	3766960	you fucking gross people right like oh what do you mean where you going you're going to get an abortion well I never said you could do that they criminalize being a woman which is the same tactic that they used with Mexicans and Asians and blacks criminalizing a woman is a great way to criminalize being poor right I like you you're if you criminalize the woman in every family the poor families are gonna crumble before the families they can get a nanny right god damn it we figured it out but the good news is they left a bunch of holes in this recent attack
3766960	3796960	which is that because it's based on policy and because it's based on the sweeping legislation what we can do is on a grassroots effort hand to hand talk to one another no internet just talk to your neighbor get involved do those things and they won't see that one of the things that I always say is when I was working for Planned Parenthood volunteering in the neighborhoods I never bumped into a Republican that's how I know we can succeed forensic files they go like they always use whenever they don't have DNA or
3796960	3826960	thumbprints or anything or or you know it's like geographic forensics always like they're like criminals are lazy everyone's lazy not criminals people are lazy criminals are people if you were gonna rob someone how far from your house would you go and they like oh these are the three houses that were robbed they bring a doorbell you're under arrest god damn it if you want to find your mistress if your wife and you want to find your husband's mistress just take a walk up the block yeah cuz men are fucking lazy and they're not gonna go that far yeah well yeah
3826960	3856960	Google his office and then look what hotel is yeah the the but but it's a yeah late so like laziness that yeah hatred appeals to you by saying you won't have to do much and so that's the thing is like I haven't pierced that membrane where it's like true something about love makes you like it's like the way that I feel about Cody feeling that about strangers is the
3856960	3886960	that's the solution it's the it's the way that we could beat them we don't need you to do that well I mean I I don't need to rub your toes on my nipple and cook call me daddy but it's it's all gonna come out in her TBS show anyway so get used to it now call me daddy on TBS at least my fucked up shit's up here it's gonna be me and Elijah wood left with everybody I don't know I'm trying to I'm trying to figure out who the last
3886960	3916960	one is gonna be that's like standing side-by-side with me that's all of male Hollywood I was like is it gonna be who's it gonna be Ashton Kutcher I think Jerry O'Connell that's he seems but he seems like a nice guy is not cutting it anymore like we had a conversation at my friend's my neighbor's house he's a great guy and we I imagine this conversation is going on all over LA everybody pops open a beer and then everyone starts going like well who's next like like like who do you
3916960	3946960	think and who's last and who's things and like the anecdotes that are coming out at these fireside chats among Hollywood elites it's pretty amazing and yet not amazing at all cuz here's the thing like I don't incriminate myself by saying this because I never worked anywhere near him but really if you worked in Los Angeles you knew everything that we learned about Kevin Spacey like yes like I'm not saying that to further vilify him and like high road
3946960	3976960	to anybody I'm saying that to self account and say like this stuff that is coming to light is stuff that I think the the biggest the it's it's it occurred increasingly to me that actually this has been a Hollywood problem and it's it's rooted in a gender problem it's it's a magnification of the gender problem where the Hollywood problem is which is we we this is about labor abuse in Hollywood this is about prostitution it's it's it's about the fact
3976960	4006960	that Hollywood has had a free pass as a workplace it is not bound itself to the same laws as as Jiffy Lube which is crazy because the guy at Jiffy Lube has to be very careful what he says to Brenda from marketing in the copy room even though he's covered in oil like like and I'm not and it's like I we're we're we're privy to more fucked up shit if you knew the stories at Jiffy Lube you'd be like I don't want that guy changing
4006960	4036960	my oil and it's and it's not because we had a double standard it's because everyone currently in Hollywood comes here as a pilgrim of fantasy and wonderment everyone has read the stories and the biographies of their favorite people they've picked sides they've decided well I'm not a this guy fan I'm a this guy fan and I hope to be like this guy one day so I'm going to emulate him or her and we're so
4036960	4066960	focused it's a community of workaholics and and and every young squire that comes out is a workaholic is saying like hey can you abuse me because I want to be Dolly Parton one day I want to be Otto Preminger I want to be I want to run Hollywood I want to work for it's everything's so focused on the work that we we are indoctrinated into a society that says and then plus all that fucked up shit happens at the wrap party
4066960	4096940	right and we don't treat it the same way you would at a Christmas party for your right for your tax company right and it's kind of natural because it's like we are making a movie it's not like we're we're selling paper reams at like Scranton or whatever like like it's going to be this thing that we we all have to do and then it'll be over you know like you kind of get sucked into this it's like a tour kind of thing or we'll just we'll just make it happen I guess it is kind of it feels different I guess than just if it's like yeah if it's Brenda from accounting or something.
4096960	4097360	So Brenda from accounting has never gone through a casting process that's part of oh yeah for sure very nature of our business is is beef and cattle and the way you look and and the way you look on film well you didn't you didn't talk right to that person at that party every every story you hear about your favorite people no matter how pristine they are all of those stories if you really break them down you hear the story of this is how Barbara Streisand got her big break it it's it's not she lifted a rock in
4126960	4156960	and threw it at a lion that was attacking Bud Friedman I don't know it's I'll look it up later the it's it's it's a conversation it's like a quippy one liner yeah it's and that is that makes it like there's no oil to change in between those conversations where you can go hey you suck at changing oil or your your jiffy lubes are not showing a profit it's like no you're these movies are great and then this studio is doing
4156960	4186960	great and like all these people are either getting famous or not famous based on legends of how charismatic they were and if you already don't have a society based on reason and respect right there's an industry based on charisma right it's shouldn't shock us to be realizing that there's a lot of potato bugs under that rock yeah you cannot hold these these huge rooms full of 20 something's and then have a bunch of men
4186960	4216960	making decisions based on that and expect that to work out and it's not just sexual it's like like how many you know it's like it like like I the the fucking the goddamn it's weird how people talk to each other sometimes like casting directors assistants talking to someone who's dropping off a package it's even weird like you you would witness it and go like that was a little odd yeah but it's not like we're all out here being mean to each other either it's like you're either that or you're like this paladin that's like all gleaming
4216960	4246960	and charming and whatever we need a dead horse but what would be awesome is if we have men turning in men which men should do because men who abuse women abuse men so if we would actually weed these people out it would go a lot farther than waiting for 15 women to actually have to take this guy down it would go something like this and I pull out this list go Alan Alda and that's the thing is that people say did you know in Hollywood about these guys and the truth of the matter is yeah we we all know
4246960	4276960	not just in Hollywood you know if you work at a jiffy lube if you work at a McDonald's wherever you work you know the dude that's standing next to you that's being a jerk it's just that we're we're not manning up and that is the definition of manning up because you don't want to be a pack of dogs and you bring back a wolf and then the wolf come in to bite the other dog you should have killed that wolf yeah it's like it's it it feels like prison or mafia culture too though where you're like because I'm listening to this that that Providence Rhode Island podcast it's like there's a lot
4276960	4306960	of guys with these really sexy Rhode Island accents that even the fucking guy that's hosting the show is like they sound manlier than me because it's like I don't know they just sound like they sound like this and they I don't know I'm trying to do it and that's how they sound it to me it was what are you gonna do you know it's just the way it was it's like you get it you know I got a guy's got a problem is I got a bigger problem you know you take care of the problem it's like it's like guys are like like oh it's like we're really like susceptible to that it's like
4306960	4336960	we go like oh so I don't want to be on the wrong side of that not because we're not necessarily because we're like oh I'm like Dobby and Harry Potter I'm born to serve it's like it's actually the other part of you it's the alpha part of you I think that that has the train coupling for that because you go oh that's that sounds refreshing a society that is built on on callous hands and and horse sense right because I just think about the times when I had a conversation
4336960	4366960	with anybody strangers in bars grandfathers who were Marines and in like listening to you know watching movies about these guys it's like there's this there's this boner you get filled with it's a heart boner it's like it's like like where you go like oh yeah that's the that's a man and I
4366960	4396960	it's like I'm just saying cliches but it's like it's it's important to realize that too that it's like it's a part of it's not it's it's not like you're a you're a beta if you're afraid of an alpha you actually more have to own the little alpha inside your beta because being a if you were truly committed to being a beta I think you know okay let's all be betas in other words let's think of the other person first yeah it's the little baby alpha in you it's the that that that chimpanzee that's like I'm a beta because I can't afford
4396960	4426960	to be an alpha right now but that guy really hey I really like this the cut of his jib he really gets shit done I love that you see how he just reached out and just grabbed that problem and just shoved it into a car just cut its head off with a table saw and just dabbed his lips with a napkin I don't know how manhood works I'm making it up I can't I can't riff manhood a real man dabs his lips with a napkin calls it a napkin that's my favorite part
4426960	4456960	oh Pat Pat Patton Oswald has this did you see his comedy special yes he tells the story about the the power lifter guy yes and and then the guy coming up and it just like Patton Oswald is you know Patton Oswald is how I picture myself when I'm thinking and talking so like if you ever like that's it's like that's my that's that's my inner yeah that's my avatar but he's telling a story like we know that Patton Oswald doesn't want to hurt anybody but he's
4456960	4486960	telling this story about this time he saw this one guy lift another guy and drop him and he exploded into blood and then the guy went back to his friends as if he hadn't done anything and it's like like there's something eerie about the compatibility there like we I'll speak for myself like I'm just like yeah I at the end of the day the reason why I would punch a Nazi or run from one has everything to do with what I think a man is supposed to do it doesn't even
4486960	4516960	it's like the reason why I'm anti-fascist more than I'm a scared of communism is because my grandpas lied about their age to go into the Marines and fight fascism and I feel embarrassed in front of their ghosts because I never helped them lay cement in the driveway I was like I'm gonna go I got I think I got homework yeah no that's that's not you know the deal manhood comes in so many different ways but none of them are
4516960	4546960	violent that's what a dumb person does there there is nothing to do with being a man that is using your fists to hurt another person well right like the black guy in that story just lifts the other guy up and drops him right loads like a tarantula and he also did something that got the guy away he didn't stand and engage a dude and box the dude and wrestle the dude he picked him up showed him his strength and he dropped him and walked away that that is awful but he did try what a man is supposed to do really what a man is supposed to do it's supposed to have a command of English that lets
4546960	4576960	the other men know I'm not interested in fighting you I'm not gonna be no bitch but I'm also not interested in fighting you because what a man understands is that there's women there's people around they're gonna be scarred by whatever you're about to do the two of you and you don't want to do that to people like it's not manly to fight it's manly to figure out a way to get the fuck up out of there so you can get back to your sixty seventy thousand dollar year job you're a man go to work file the papers do the surgery don't be out in the
4576960	4606960	streets like gladiators we've we luckily have evolved to a point where you never have to hit another man you never have to hit one you can get in your car you can drive off and when cops show up because they're armed men whose job it is to suppress shit like that they will ask you what the fuck were you thinking don't strike another man you're a grown ass man they're not gonna side with you no no one is ever gonna look at you and go I'm so glad you punched that Nazi and if they are
4606960	4636960	they're not right dude that's not a man a man figures out a way to buy the Nazis house flood his bathroom you don't want to be the man that is fisticuffing it you want to be the man that's like ha ha motherfucker we're only met for you I'm only asking these questions because of to bring it back to the other thing the internet thing it's like we were also raised in a culture where information will set us free where the bad guys are
4636960	4666960	ziplipped and they don't like communication and that they do their work in the darkness and the good guys shine spotlights and they go in the 80s movies the nerd who takes power always does it by going like can I get everyone's attention
4666960	4696960	the 80s at all there's always the scene where the cafeteria's attention is directed and forget about like the teeny teenage culture it's even also just like every hero myth that we have so far was always about we got to get the word out oh look look out the window look all the people they got the word right or the tape plays and then the you hear the wiretap of the senator going you think I care about these animal people and everyone goes like wow I heard the truth the movies over
4696960	4726960	no more lies wow those lies were building up for 90 minutes and 20 years now enter an era where you can't no more lies I heard it over the loudspeaker going home and now we're just like every morning we get up and we're like stop with the truth and the lie truth and the truth lies and the it doesn't it's a now what now we're all thinking about punching people because I was like
4726960	4756960	prove that baloney's made sloppy now no one's gonna give you a Pulitzer maybe they will but maybe the Pulitzer people have their shit together it just doesn't feel like a recourse to heroism anymore to go like aha look look how dark the world is I found some darkness over in this corner with my flashlight everyone's gonna go like no shit yeah that's what I'm saying that's what you serve those batteries it used to be fun you'd be cynical and you were pointing out shit that was really interesting cuz it was dark and now no now we don't wanna we don't wanna see that
4756960	4786960	darkness we're dealing with our own darkness fuck all right but but but we're gonna learn how to love we are gonna love and and and I'm gonna love people like by loving myself and like not thinking of myself as like the end all be all things that's like my therapist is like all this drama like oh you were an anarchist and now you're a pussy and like like like it all has to do with you it's like it's like you're too it's just like be other people yeah just like like like feel you're an obscure person you
4786960	4816960	just a regular guy like like like you're going through changes society's going through changes you're moving along with it like you don't have to like have you don't have to be the best at something the worst at something and this doesn't have to represent everything it's like you're just a dude just like fucking and now the challenge is don't use that as an excuse to like avoid processing like now you have to go I'm afraid of this I like this this makes me sad this makes me angry
4816960	4846960	it could be wrong I was wrong yesterday blah blah blah and it's like kind of a challenge to it's just because Facebook was a great friend that showed up and had a bunch of stories to tell and it got really cool and then as we all built it up and Twitter is the same as we all built it up and gave it all this information so that it could love us more we discovered that it became bipolar and now when you listen to your old friend Twitter your old friend Facebook they're really only focusing on the roughest of the rough and that is not reality I took a
4846960	4876960	week off I didn't didn't log in didn't clock and didn't use my laptop for anything other than writing and the world did not change nothing happened my brain got better I started to see more shit out there but that's part of the problem is that that new TV of the laptop is the computer is sort of got you able to see the bad that you wouldn't have seen before and it's not that bad it's really not that I know it looks and sounds so scary when you when you look at it but the truth of the
4876960	4906960	matter is kids are still going to school safely every morning doctors are still saving lives in surgery Puerto Rico's fucked up but for the most part America still has like it's still has itself don't normalize I'm not normalizing you black people are always normalizing well it's one of the things it's like yeah if you were if you're
4906960	4936960	like God if I walk outside of my house I'm gonna get murdered the truth of the matter is that they're hyping you man they're trying to make you feel like there are more police shootings than ever they're trying to make you feel like there's all this other shit going down and it's it's there's not and if there is it's because like you said we're in the middle of sort of a change and it looks a little rough right now but it's it's not like what we're looking at but those mass shooting statistics are they're spiking right like there's a
4936960	4966960	they're going out but there's been all the thing is like people to show mass shootings though it's it's it's regular sized shootings that kill most of the people right like I mean there's there's there's there's a shooting with about four four plus victims every single week and has been basically for two years or something like those that's what adds up you know I mean don't get me wrong it's a mass tragedy is a mass tragedy but like at the end of the day if we're talking about loss of life it's not just mass shootings that we have to worry about it's you know car accidents and mass shootings and
4966960	4996960	attacks right healthcare all right how long have I been indulging myself oh Jesus all right let's do one rap cuz I want to do one without the audience is there a beat can I get a beat but no no no no you just do this while I well I talked don't let anything I say distract you from beat picking but but I was thinking like like
4996960	5026960	an advantage of the of the of the of the of the no audience format could be that sorry we did I could put headphones on we're not gonna do that this week I could put headphones on and hear the beat you could do it too like we can hear the metronome we hear the beat but then we wrap into the live stream and then somebody out there like these guys are really good like they take the stuff and then they can add music they'd have them cleaner audio I hear what you're saying I did a thing I did it the thing at the top of last week
5026960	5056960	podcast of the booth it was I just did I just rift this like Harmon town thing and and and this audio engineer Harry like he he he added like all this he like produced it and it's like it sounds fucking amazing it's like I don't know how you put me on tempo and like we didn't start with it cuz it's like it's very gospel and there was a horrible church shooting and it's like I was like I don't know if I'm being a overcook but I was just like I don't know I don't even want those dots connected
5056960	5086960	probably we could play it now that you set it up you know yeah you already you already like created deniability you know by the time you know by the time this goes out that we'll all be over the church shooting oh yeah the beat okay okay you ready
5086960	5116960	yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo trees leaves roots sleeves dirt earth pebbles bass chick chick chick treble rapping at you with my lips I fucked your mama so hard I sunk her titties ships
5116960	5146960	her and I fucked your mama so hot she made my penis bend she's like a pussy prism she made my dick contort and refract and reflect of the world's worst things I made your mama sing she said I love dance penis I'm committed to your mom I'm gonna take her to the prom even though I'm 44 and she's
5146960	5176960	50 we thought that it would be nifty it's not nostalgia it's not the school we went to picking one at random and seeing what they do when a middle-aged couple walks in the door and pretends that it's their problem and gets on the dance floor will they police us will they try to stop the beat I don't know let's find out the truth is in the street Obama and Trump need to go back to school
5176960	5206960	that was a solid rap going to the prom even though I'm sure we all we're all lateral thinkers but no one wants to hear from the rapper right now that says Obama and Trump need to go back to school right like
5206960	5236960	who are you rooting for I liked it cuz I was like I gotta see him justify this one cuz they didn't learn the delegates I just want to be I don't know who's it who's the guy I love that I like that I like that like not just the angry is that angry like the gruff the gruff rappers like DMX yeah like that or the guys that are they like growl while they're wrapping like I want to be a growl rapper but it but the reason I want to be is because it's the same reason I can't because I think that takes more you need more
5236960	5266960	science to drop that much science I mean you do have to know your rhyme pretty well to growl throughout DMX was super good at it cuz he would just stop and he would start his shit off with like I'm coming for you turn on the lights pull my pants down and then would wrap and then Busta Rhymes classic
5266960	5296960	he'd get revved up like a little 70s like wind-up toy and then like like ghostface killer like it was I think it was like above all my favorite cuz he would start like slick Rick kind of like yeah he like I'm ghostface killer and I'm here to say he doesn't never said that by the time he got to the end of a thing I felt like like I always
5296960	5326960	fucking take it no more than like yeah I would love to see people who aren't you doing the kicky baby dance yeah it would be amazing I mean it's amazing when you don't do it it would be cool it would be it would be helpful if if the hip-hop community started adopting my my my my ways I'm sure that's already happening I do want to go to like a just like a hut on a back road in Atlanta and find like just jet black
5326960	5356960	pants and wrap and wrap it in your same pattern I told you man you can't talk about that man you're not depressed like damn man no dude spit again you don't you're not on the spectrum right right I saw you shaking hands with people and hugging them and shit you're not on the spectrum you know if you're gonna
5356960	5386960	I'm not self-diagnosing my therapist keeps telling me I don't have autism how you gonna be a Dan Harmon rapper in your DJ name is strobe light you know you would have a seizure and freak out that's so offensive you're thinking of epileptics black man what y'all gonna do man come at me epileptics come at me I dare you epileptics calling autistic people epileptics like calling Samuel Jackson
5386960	5416960	and that no one's going to write a letter is that how did you see this YouTube clip of Sam Jackson is like doing press for some movies doing and then like the like morning show host like set I think he he said something that makes it clear that he has confused him with I think Morgan Freeman it's either Morgan Freeman or Wesley Snipes okay one of those but and then and then like I just I don't remember anything about it except just like awkward because it was like the money because it was like Jackson didn't let it go because
5416960	5446960	how could he you can't even even if he wanted to be a team player he could like how are you supposed to bounce back from that right after 1995 and he was like he's just like no we're gonna talk about this now and then and then the morning so guys like okay all right come on now like well you literally dehumanized me you confused to me it would be one thing I mean yes if you were a valet parker and you like oh I forgot which one had the Porsche because same hair
5446960	5476960	color but like you booked him on your show and you thought he did a different movie that's we got to stop doing television yeah yeah we have to stop and take a little time out here especially if you get your fame off of me if the reason that you're famous is cuz you interview celebrity like what right what am I milking today well you're milking this cow oh well I how's it feeling to be this cow I'm not this cow and that cow well whatever
5476960	5506960	milk is milk that's what Ghostface would say you can't you can't you can't riff an impression of Ghostface you can do it if you go by casinos what was it yeah all right I was trying to think of one of his rhymes but did you see the M&M thing by the way I did I mean everybody did I did yeah I'm not gonna give it the four stars that everybody else is giving it but I do appreciate the effort for what what I mean I want to hear the
5506960	5536960	reaction it could have been better it could have been better it's offbeat the rhyming yeah it's not clear don't you think he's what what if he's what if he's what if he's actually really making it up on the spot what if he he did he's out of practice yeah it's not the old and okay so normally he'll do like a a a a a a a a rhyme pattern where he's just rhyming word after word after word right and he didn't do that that's classic M&M he didn't do that he did more of like a yell speak spoken word poetry and when you're is lyrically
5536960	5566960	talented and you can flow like he is like he can you sort of expect him it'd be like you know it'd be like it's like when Prince would come out and he would just do an acoustic set you'd be like yeah but the combination I guess it's like the stakes are so much higher because it's like like oh he's just oh he's saying I hate Trump and it's like that's like controversial which is a fucked up thing he's like two years late there's a lot of rappers that had already dis trumped the right out the gate so that was the
5566960	5596960	other issue yeah but he know what I'm saying is that he knows the weight of the train he's driving that took to what to what station and what wall it's gonna go through and whatever like you and I are talking about it I don't know about these other guys so he knows that he's whether whatever he thinks about himself I'm just saying like that would affect that would affect me too why am I arguing with you I asked your opinion I was like why do we do that to people we go like what did you think and then you go like well I didn't
5596960	5626960	like it and you're like well tell tell me why you didn't like it and then they tell you why and you're like wow I don't know about that though I'd also like to say you didn't address the technical that's that's my only B right actually truly I wasn't really there was there was some rhymes in there where I was like holy shit that's pretty awesome but truly the reason why I did think it was awesome is because as a fragile white dude who loved Eminem and who is probably his age and who like just feels helpless and Eminem's got you know like it
5626960	5656960	it's like well he's not a it's not a role model and he's not nor even in hip hop or whatever it was like he he reappears and I always thought he was talented I guess he's like the Quentin Tarantino of rapping or something like no he's pretty he's pretty high up there I'm like always in his corner I'm like I wish people wish and then and then and I was just happy to see him again and he looked good yeah I don't know about that beard that beer was a little and and he was like fervently yes fucking like
5656960	5686960	anarchically political in his messaging in a way that was just like straight up that that is I was the reason I was excited about it was because of all those things and he didn't fuck up and like right like he didn't like say north south east west a dog is your friend best I don't know why you got scared that he was gonna fuck up I did well because he was freestyling right I mean uh-uh he wasn't no well now I hate it
5686960	5716960	it's still incredible I thought he was freestyling no that a freestyle why was he going hold on hold it here's the most fucked up thing is that our generation freestyling is off the top of the dome younger kids think freestyling is when you don't have a musical track and you are you're doing your song a cappella so it's almost like remember remix used to be this is a new version of that song with the same lyrics and now remix is just a longer version
5716960	5746960	of a song or a different beat that isn't quite the same you fucking kids here's what freestyling used to be hit it yeah yeah y'all about to be taken back to what freestyle used to be yeah when people got confused and they want peas and carrots soups and plates what I tried to fuck your mama but it's her I hate I'm hateful person and I hate your mom so why did I fuck her my name is Tom mr. Cruz is what they call me I'd like to tell you about
5746960	5776960	technology you get your beatings clear get them off your back and then you give me $5,000 back L rod Hubbard is the man to beat I want to fuck your mama's titties gonna put my dick in her feet okay I was that is often that's freestyle then I thought I'd throw it to you but but now they're like I'm gonna do my song that you guys all know about but I'm gonna do with our cappella so no I'm freestyle all right yeah that's it well I also heard a distinction I was talking to open mic about about the M&M
5776960	5806960	thing and we're talking about freestyling and like what what is the I was talking about like what are the rules like what's the religion surrounding freestyling like like when M&M and the Slim Shady album what the fuck was it where he's like he's freestyling and it's like like like like how much are you allowed to edit if you got busted editing would it be like a million vanilla scandal you know you cannot edit if it's on your album it's like a freestyle track is it is it like a scandal if someone like leaks the thing and you're like taking ten minutes ago I
5806960	5836960	should rhyme sugar with booger yeah but Mike was saying that like for instance there's then there's another distinction where it's like rappers like Jay Z will they pride themselves on not writing anything down but they don't mean they're freestyling they just mean they don't use pen and paper they just like play themselves like an instrument like they'll and they'll they're like Pink Floyd about it like they'll they're just doing it in layers and passes and like going off the off their head but they're refining it there's people who are going off their head and then there are people who have memorized freestyle rhymes
5836960	5866960	I imagine if you constantly freestyling then you're gonna know mouth rhymes with south right you know it's gonna happen we all run through the a to the e to the d work our way to the shuns tio ends and then we get we get freakier with that so everybody's gonna be like I went today to see some pay and I went my way and then they're gonna move on to it's easy to see to be me it's so easy to be he and then that's what I try to do so the complexity is always like can you do what M&M is super complex and that he goes
5866960	5896960	a a a a for the whole first line which is bananas when he said and that's hard to freestyle because you that you need a dictionary which he also just thinks phonetically or something that's what impresses me about like good like yeah styles when people are like oh they don't even they're like they like hear in sound so it's like I stole your mom as accurate wrecked it and sold it back to her it's like that doesn't rhyme yeah it does yeah like I would it doesn't rhyme to me but it right it does when you say it if you think in rhymes also like kids nowadays don't rhyme anymore so
5896960	5926960	yeah somebody will say basket and somebody will say kick it and it's the IT that you were supposed to be rhyming off but you run out of your magic words you got to do you back in the day you you had to rhyme words had to rhyme and it couldn't be a party chant all of a sudden like just cuz you didn't rhyme it couldn't suddenly become a hook that's what happens when you strip language down you got rid of the word Eskimo now how are you gonna rhyme give me some oh can't rhyme in you it you fucked yourself millennial freestylers
5926960	5956960	into it I never met it in you it that wasn't into it I never met it in you it that wasn't into it okay so it was an hour 20 and then I talked for what another fucking 40 minutes yeah are we so not to put you in the spot but D&D or not well we have 15 minutes do you want to not to put me on the spot
5956960	5986960	it's totally up to you though cuz like it's if you if you don't feel like doing it nobody's gonna be like I hate Spencer for not feeling like playing D&D for 15 no one on reddit would say anything like that and no one would tweet me about it either right now there's a dude on reddit pulling up his pants and wiping his boner away he's drafting a positive and a negative response if we do it he's mad if we don't do children just got beat Dewey defeats Truman I wasn't gonna hurt you
5986960	6016960	until I find out no day stop drinking your dinner nine paragraphs out of why they shouldn't have played D&D it's like it's great it's a lot of fun we have a great fan base and I enjoy them appreciate their patronage but if we if we if we wrapped up right now we'd be I wouldn't hate that I wouldn't hate trying I yeah I just think that we what happens what has happened in the past should we throw let's let's if you if you are
6016960	6046960	if you want to leave it to me and then you don't have to you won't be sapped of your of your power cuz I can say Spencer had to me I would play D&D and here's why I would say it because we've done everything else that we usually do in this space tonight and I thought the fun experiment was doing without an audience so if we then don't play a little D&D I think that's a mistake right well like I didn't want to do that awesome rap that was I forced that yeah sometimes you put on the high heels even though you're a feminist you know I feel like you asked me what I wanted to do and when I was answering the question you
6046960	6076960	answered what you wanted to do yeah Spencer he did the same thing to me why don't you guys go to a fucking Black Panther Matter rally damn it I just the what the problem that I perceive is that what happens is when we have a very drastically shortened session right no one remembers what happened and everyone forgets further about what happened in the session before that and then it becomes harder the next time we show up to actually but you know we could do it it's just that I mean I
6076960	6106960	just like I was just moments ago I was like ready to not play I got the sense and like you're not gonna accept this observation this is me as guest comptroller and we love you Jeff Davis please hurry back maybe we do a recap of last week and just do a couple opening lines I'm fine with that all right all right I get to sit down so let's bring up Steve Levy
6106960	6123120	Steve Levy show Steve Levy show who's clapping for him it's the Levy show if you get the fire marshal is watching if he hears the applause he's gonna burst in with an axe
6123120	6152840	it's the Levy show what's up how are you Steve I'm good any love life updates I guess shit I guess if there are you can't say so yeah let's let's check in later give me some time maybe there's things maybe not hmm give me a month or two all right yeah yeah we all know what
6152840	6182480	somebody says give me a month or two yeah you want some time yeah yeah that's like the best place where you just have like an extreme crush and like you just like someone else is in charge of whether you're happy or sad yeah it's like what cavemen must have felt before they knew the Sun wasn't a tortoise wheel it's like the littlest thing that they do that makes you so happy right yeah like returning a text instead of letting it lay there like a fucking fart because you finally said something
6182840	6212080	fucking weird and creepy right and all your bullshit is like going to the ice cream you see ice cream you should not be that happy about that and like yeah and like yeah any mention of a movie it is great I'm not being sarcastic like those are the moments and it's like it's like it for me it's never disingenuous it's like that's like your body is flooded with that chemical it doesn't make the love that that that ends up happening later less genuine but that's definitely a drug
6212080	6241840	that you're on that is like amazing to be on where it's like another person is is just a god and you're and you're just struggling every day with like whether to overdo it underdo it I'm just gonna fucking be me man I'm gonna fall in love yeah constantly coming back to the realization just got to be yourself she doesn't like it but it's like every every breath and every yeah everything is a potential land mine it's great where are we Spencer Crittenden it's a great question
6242480	6250400	um so you want us to play the music I don't think we have that capacity yeah we do play the music
6252720	6271520	shit wow I'm surprised hell yeah last time on Harmon time uh you guys had gone back to the keep to turn in your mission and you turned in the mission and then uh you decided to go get your pay for the mission so you went to the commissary and got paid
6272400	6278560	as part of your debriefing you had left Patchens with the church and had agreed to meet up with him
6278560	6300320	so you went to the tavern to meet up with him but he didn't show up so diarrhea junior went to go look for him and he found him and what did he find Patchens was mad at our group and didn't want their help because they had caused problems for Patchens in the past and he just wanted to tell them that he was leaving and leaving he did
6301040	6309280	but uh the gang conspired or transpired they they talked about what they should do they were like ah
6309280	6315200	you should probably see what's up and then Jeff summoned a horse and he fell off the horse because
6315200	6322800	it disappeared and chased after Patchens and he found Patchens and was like wait right here
6323440	6326800	it was ambiguous whether or not you two are with him at the time
6328320	6339280	what will happen who will do what we'll see how will be Harmon time now actually now
6343840	6351120	all right so any any questions uh Brandon you you don't have any clue so all questions would be
6351120	6355280	acceptable I'd assume or if you have none that makes sense too because what what questions could
6355280	6361600	you have if you have no knowledge to begin with but I'm just happy to be Jeff once you're getting
6361600	6367040	better and better at those that's they're very exciting right it's not like I was really good
6367040	6371520	at it for a while and then completely stopped having to do it and lost practice and I'm getting
6371520	6376720	back into the group I'm reaching new heights that I never achieved I think you are right
6377680	6384640	that's what you said yeah well if if we're not with Patchens I assume I kind of picture it as
6384640	6389840	like Jeff got on his phantom horse that he summoned he rode for a burst and then it it
6389840	6393600	just it doesn't last that long yeah and then he kind of sprinted off and then he sprinted ahead of
6393600	6400000	us and he said he said wait here to Patchens and I assume like you know we would be now the rest of
6400000	6405520	us me and diarrhea would be coming up to where they are if you want yeah that sounds good yeah
6406000	6410480	I'm gonna bring back some food I left the guy where he's supposed to be you guys come up to
6410480	6416160	meet him I'll bring back some snacks you're gonna Chad's gonna get snacks yeah I love this plan I
6416160	6423040	meant to all right well don't go all right I mean I don't want to who doesn't like snacks
6423040	6430160	well I just we we we haven't been all together yet so if you if you go off I'm just scared that
6430160	6435120	we're gonna get separated again to coming right back I promise okay do I get snacks
6435120	6440000	nearby like perhaps within earshot I feel like we got the guy it's everything's about to go down
6440000	6444960	we're gonna be hungry okay if we go anywhere we're gonna follow the road in the direction
6444960	6451920	that Patchens was heading so great and if and if we're not that means something's gone wrong
6452480	6456640	in which case it would be important more important to find us so we're not with Patchens
6456640	6462480	but Carlos and I are running toward him right it's best well you met up with Chad who is getting
6462480	6467360	snacks let's say 50 feet from Patchens who is told to wait there so you're now approaching
6467360	6476160	Patchens okay great Chad is presumably getting snacks if I understand Patchens hey guys I heard
6476160	6486240	you didn't want us to help you right and here you are well we owe you help yeah I mean that's
6486240	6492800	probably true I don't I honestly feel like everything I've done with you has only put my
6492800	6498560	life into jeopardy and I don't I'm worried that that would happen more with your help rather than
6498560	6504240	you know it would be alleviated I guess that's where I'm coming from Patchens what church do we
6504240	6511520	belong to the church of the silver flame what does flame do burns what does burning feel like
6511520	6519120	terrible is it good well it depends on the context right but you love your church
6520400	6527360	the silver flame is the flame of truth flame is a reaction between heat and things that it overtakes
6527360	6533520	the process can be damaging it it can be helpful to things around it it all depends on who's
6533520	6542880	getting burnt and what use is getting gotten out of it the truth burns away at lies everything
6542880	6551120	gets challenged I failed you like I I came upon you and needed your help and you helped us and
6551120	6557120	I owe you and I know that I suck at it like I've been holed up in the church you know looking for
6557120	6561680	an opportunity to do something right instead of the bureaucratic bullshit they send us out on and
6561680	6568560	we encountered you and I believe that the silver flame somehow made us you know intersect and so
6569440	6579440	I I understand you not thinking that we're gonna be good at it right but we did try and I've never
6579440	6584880	betrayed you I've just failed you I've never lied to you yeah I mean that's that's the problem as
6584880	6590400	I'm explaining it yeah you're just saying why I shouldn't go along with you well there's there's
6590560	6593840	no there's no control group to this experiment where you're doing awesome on your own and I don't
6593840	6598160	want to turn it into a fight like that we don't know that that's the case all right I might be
6598160	6602960	awesome hey man we love you you've been there from the beginning you're like our scooby again
6602960	6607600	that's never that's not the question the problem is not these guys don't love me enough the problem
6607600	6612640	is that their love is potentially lethal but what if somebody owes you something what if we
6612640	6617280	owe you like like just because you don't want to accept our debt to you doesn't mean that we don't
6617280	6628720	owe you that's the problem do you have diplomacy uh diplomacy I do have it the box is checked but
6628720	6636240	there's no there's no okay then do you have charisma I have like a 16 charisma that says
6636240	6643200	ability modifier plus three all right your words touched him he's like you know what I'm almost
6643280	6649840	certain this will get me killed but you can come if you want to join the adventure of pachins gem
6651520	6657280	yeah we gotta well we usually take a vote on party matters and
6658320	6662640	all right fuck you I'm leaving no no no I'm kidding it was can't leave without these snacks
6662640	6670800	hey everybody hey what kind of snacks did you get I got a little jerky and I got these beat chips
6670800	6678320	what kind of jerky bison so yeah bison jerky okay great this tastes really fresh it's almost like
6678320	6686800	it's a fine line between bison jerky and did you just come upon a bison actually yes oh yeah yeah
6686800	6693120	and I'm glad that you are enjoying it that's good yeah this is great let us all eat from my snack
6693120	6702960	bucket you eat from the snack bucket that happens you really nailed it chad so pachins before we
6702960	6710560	help you we're going to need to know more about this gem right it's a gem important people at the
6710560	6715280	church told me to keep it safe and they said my whole job was to keep it just safe and that was
6715280	6720320	my whole job at the church and it was a special position that was different than the normal
6720400	6726400	hierarchy but that was it was an important position and so they sent me to rone a quiet town
6726400	6732320	to lay low and then it seemed like it wasn't so quiet anymore so I'm trying I tried to lay low
6732320	6737920	some more and then I got jacked and I don't know who jacked it but you know rone is nearby the
6737920	6744880	town of door nester and door nester is a town full of thieves and ruffians and that's we were
6744880	6750880	right by it when I got attacked we got attacked I suppose and uh that's that's where I was headed
6750880	6755200	I don't know what's gonna happen but that's why I don't necessarily want to take people with me
6755200	6759520	because I don't know that it'll do anything but I gotta do what I gotta do otherwise I'm gonna
6759520	6763760	get murdered well the men that have sailed us were hired hands for sure they were disguised
6763760	6769120	as banditos but they were actually you know professional mercenaries so it sounds like you're
6769120	6774400	on the right track what did the gem do are we allowed to know that what what did the gem do
6775200	6780320	yeah it's a church treasure he was just put in charge of keeping it hidden like yeah it was like
6780320	6785680	a prince's lair it doesn't have any magical properties didn't glow it didn't do anything
6785680	6790480	when I shook it I don't it's like a big gem he doesn't know anything they picked an obscure
6790480	6794000	turd of a man and put him in the middle of nowhere where they thought that no one would
6794000	6798000	ever find or look for the gem and they were right you think stumbled onto it fucked it up do you
6798000	6803360	think the crazy vampire lady has any connection it was a totally random thing no they weren't there
6803360	6808560	for he was sleeping with the gem excuse me for a second Patience this guy is a you know he wasn't
6808560	6814560	doing anything he's just sleeping we had our dumb adventure that we half botched and then we took
6814560	6819680	him told him he had to come with us to town and on the way there we got robbed maybe I'm a conspiracy
6819680	6825600	theorist but I think everything's connected here I did you share that with I mean that's also
6825600	6832400	schizophrenics and uh yeah I'm owning it I just alienated one in 20 of our listeners
6834480	6842400	right everything is connected yes but to the town past Rowan yeah that's that's what someone
6842400	6847280	who didn't think everything was connected would say so we were just saying let's go the the dot
6847280	6853040	we're connecting is that the men that have sailed us were uh they were they were they were hired
6853040	6860240	this is like a uh somebody with the money to make other people do bad things like hired a gang of
6860240	6864560	people to disguise themselves and way less I don't think they were affiliated with the vampires
6864560	6870800	because the vampires weren't looking for Patience or his gem that was an unrelated story uh and and
6870800	6878240	and this is a new one no one's touched my merballs are they too spicy what is a merball I set them
6878240	6885520	next to the bison jerky you you didn't try them I'll eat it I worked really hard on this I'm not
6885520	6892000	gonna eat it you you made it yeah I said snacks didn't I Patience I'm gonna tell you right now if
6892000	6900480	shit goes bad and you try the excuse of like we're bad at doing what we do again you can but
6901200	6906240	not if you don't tell us everything you know right now if you know more information than you've
6906240	6912320	already shared with us about people who might be looking for that gem you know it's it's gonna be
6912320	6918160	way less on us when we fuck up again I truly don't know I feel like my job was not to know
6918160	6922560	for safety's sake I got that impression and I'm willing to believe you yeah I mean it seems like
6922560	6926960	they just buried this gem deep into the in obscurity they didn't want anyone to ever
6927520	6932800	think about it and you did a great job that's why I feel like we owe you yeah I feel like the church
6932800	6938960	has these two different functions there's like the function of of of cooperating with the way
6938960	6944480	the world already works which isn't good and then there's the function of purifying the world and I
6944480	6950080	feel like the people that put you in charge of that gem are you know they're more lateral
6951040	6954640	they're more punk rock you know what they are more punk rock
6954640	6964080	right who was it to put you in charge of that gem uh just some bishop traitor no no and not that
6964080	6970560	other guy avat avas man I don't even know his name he was such as a robert's character oh it was roberts
6973520	6981440	um the mysterious roberts all right well I pick up a merball to pachins onward and then I take
6981440	6988800	a bite of it and it's it tastes really funky it's kind of gooey and warm in the middle
6988800	6994160	and I'm like what what did you what did you want me to eat what is this thing too salty
6994160	6998880	what is it too salty I knew I knew I knew too salty I'm so sorry I did the best I could
6999600	7005680	is it meat is it a plant that's the thing about mer it's kind of meaty planty it's like seaweed
7005680	7012320	I eat I eat a merball and I let the dungeon master tell me how it tasted oh it tastes like
7012320	7018080	it might be too salty I should probably I should probably get some experience points for it yeah
7018080	7023200	you get some experience points because I didn't you know what you did there I'm kind of dm'd for
7023200	7030640	yourself yeah he's a bit improvy yeah sorry it's fine I mean we're all just trying to
7030640	7040720	do our thing and it's great but it's true cue music uh the the uh the marching uh no
7042480	7051280	tom howard who's the who's the uh composer did the swelling music strings no no uh the lord of
7051280	7056720	the rings guy that howard howard shore cue howard shore as we don't literally cue howard shore
7056800	7063280	we'll get we'll be in big trouble as we as we as we as we journey off as we do whatever
7063280	7068560	spencer says we're doing you travel for for a couple days and you reach a crossroads and you
7068560	7073440	can see the way to door nester and also a sign that points to door nester you hear uh you hear
7073440	7079760	more not more can we just do a quick though while we're if we're walking that far just like the audio
7079760	7083680	of the dialogue rises and falls we do a little montage of sound bites of stuff we're talking
7083760	7090720	about while we're walking so like balls I just think that you know if if my dogs are gonna come
7090720	7096640	eight in a package why do buns come six in a package right I guess it's because somebody
7096640	7105440	might come over okay all right end of my time all right figure that one out you travel for some
7105440	7110560	time and you come to the crossroads you see the sign marking door nester uh and you can see kind
7110560	7117280	of down this hilly path of rolling hills you can see door nester kind of nestled next to a forest
7117280	7123760	and and you can also see what looks like a graveyard um this is door nester oh boy you
7123760	7128880	hear the sound of hoof beats pounding as a horse rides up to you and on that horse
7131360	7135920	I hope we're getting that that's great and on that horse is a familiar face
7135920	7144240	it's geffen that guy here's brown armor and stuff oh boy what up geffen we see you again
7144240	7153120	this is crazy coincidence huh yeah wow what are you guys doing well we snacks tell them about the
