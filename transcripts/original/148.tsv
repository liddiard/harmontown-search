89000	92760	like does anybody have connections in the garment industry that would be
92760	98960	able to sell a good as new jacket and then does anyone know anyone able to

105160	108280	trick us because he said does anyone have a needle and thread we were
108280	113200	excited because we thought we were gonna see like sartorial Rambo like. Now
113200	121320	Hannah needs the person with the needle. Is it black thread we hope? Nobody has
121320	125360	needle and thread? We got Hannah here holding the button like a like an idiot.
125360	131800	I'm kidding. No. Of course. I mean like she's holding the bag here. You got the
131800	141360	thread? Seth where's your bag? Fortune needle and thread is in Orange County
141360	144320	right now? Oh what's happening over here? This is already the worst podcast I've
144320	150960	ever been. Okay now that there's a there's a needle point thing happening
150960	157000	over here. Oh that's yeah. Blue thread is fantastic. All right. Hannah may I give
157000	161640	you my jacket? I'm gonna take my wallet and other pertinent things out of it.
161880	170080	Say what? Thank you sir. Let's hear it for Mistrustful Mickey back there. He's our
170080	177040	regular character he's reminding all of us. All right you take your phone I've
177040	181280	seen it. What is your name madam? Who's got the needle and thread here? Heather
181280	184840	Heather are you a needle point enthusiast over here? What's going on?
184840	191560	Your friend is is your friend. How do you know she's your friend? Take it easy
191560	200480	Mickey. She it's a general vibe. Yeah but how do you define it? If she was on a
200480	209760	railroad track and it was you or her. Mistrustful Mickey is he's endearing.
209760	213280	All right. Hannah Hannah and Heather everybody they're gonna they're gonna
213280	219600	fix my jacket. What's they're gonna do Dan? They're not just fixing my jacket
219600	227200	they're saving Memorial Day. I wouldn't think I don't you unbutton it when you
227200	232240	sit down anyway? Yes but this is not business that was necessary. I have shit
232240	237080	to do after the show I can't be sewing buttons on. Oh man. I thought I would
237080	240720	mine the vast resources of talents in our Harman Town audience. This is fucked
240720	246080	up. I guess I guess you don't get paid to do the show so that's fine. You were
246080	251640	owed a little bit you you farmed labor and that's fine. Okay Hannah do you feel
251640	256320	exploited right now? No. Will you be able to enjoy and listen to the show while
256320	263520	doing this? Okay. This is how she listens to podcast. She didn't expect to be doing it
263520	270880	tonight. Is there a shoe shine in the crowd right now? Does anyone know how to
270880	277160	hydroponically harvest soy? Because we're so close to our moon colony at
277160	283600	this point because Hannah could get started on a few jumpsuits after this.
283600	288560	We've returned back to our moon colony. Yeah oh man now more than ever now that
288560	292680	it's now that it's getting to be election season yeah anyways all right
292680	303880	so here's a here's a segment that everyone loves called Green Room Antics.
303880	308080	Okay everyone everyone everyone enjoys hearing about behind the scenes in
308080	311960	Harman Town. So I needed a mint because I probably haven't brushed my teeth in two
311960	319280	days I can't remember and and that a mint will wipe that right out and it's
319280	326560	a perfect substitute for it's it's the withdrawal of oral hygiene. 100%
326560	334600	effective. So I asked I said does anyone have gum or a mint and and then and then
334600	339720	Justin wasn't in the room his girlfriend Elizabeth was. Elizabeth said I think
339720	344720	Dustin has some some mints. Dustin came in Elizabeth said Dustin do you have any
344960	352160	mints and and and Dustin said yeah I have some altoids can you can you give
352160	357080	one to Dan and Dustin was like what why does your stomach hurt and and and
357080	359720	Elizabeth starts laughing and I don't know what I understand what the hell is
359720	366440	going on. So just and she's like does your stomach hurt? And and then and then
366440	371160	Dustin leaves to go get the altoids and Elizabeth says every time I have a
371160	377120	stomachache Dustin gives me an altoid and I love him so I pretend it helps my
377120	387840	stomachache. And I've never told anyone this until tonight she said she's been
387840	394560	conditioning him to believe that altoids are for your stomach. Dustin do you
394560	404320	think altoids are for your stomach? Get out there. Dustin Marshall everybody. The
404320	407760	same reason you get a dinner mint after you eat at a restaurant because the mint
407760	414800	settles your stomach but that's the logic. I was a child that's what I that's
414800	420280	what I learned. This is for you see so you think when I when you go to a
420280	424280	restaurant and you get that little red and white stripey circle mint thing but
424600	430320	that's for your stomach? How's it for your breath? Oh I thought it was to settle your
430320	444120	stomach. Dustin Marshall everybody. All right hey who needs letterman? What a show. By
444120	449760	the way I'm sure you've noticed you know now that Dustin's out of the out of the
449760	454320	Huskow you should all hide your cartoon money. He likes to wear that black and
454320	462720	white striped shirt a lot. Don't put any pies on the windowsills. All right so
462720	467040	anyways okay so so god I mean I really okay I had so much to talk about. All
467040	470820	right so all right so you know how in Mad Max Fury Road everybody's got their
470820	475160	little designations their little jobs like there's the war boys and the other
475160	480760	people. How do you get the guitar guy job? You have to be fucking badass. Also
480760	484560	you have to not mind a lot of sand in your face because he's right out front.
484560	488920	Yeah and he's relatively oh yeah it did seem like he was blind yeah which I was
488920	492960	good that's how he got that job. He's like a prodigy or so or did they poke
492960	496720	his eyes out in some kind of ritualistic thing. I would I would watch a
496720	500760	whole movie about that guitar player guy. Yeah it was pretty great. Okay good
500760	508240	movie okay but you know you don't have to well I mean are you qualifying your
508240	512480	love of Fury Road right now? No no I'm not at all not at all I just I just like
512480	517960	I've kept my lips zipped. Erin enjoyed that movie so much and all of her
517960	521480	friends have enjoyed that movie so much and then on the way home there's just
521480	524880	that like she's like oh man it was so impactful it's so good such a refreshing
524880	530160	change and then and then she was like how did you enjoy the movie? Was that
530160	538360	intimidating for you? And I was like no no but inside I was like fuck you and I
538360	542320	have only said that to you guys don't tell her. I was just kind of like what
542320	546280	come on. Intimidated by the feminism? Yeah yeah like like like oh are you able to
546280	557560	handle that explosion boy penis man? I don't care who's blowing shit up. I love that there's men's group that hate that
557560	561120	movie for being too feminist. It's a bunch of dudes fighting and blowing
561120	564000	shit up. Well also Mad Max as a protagonist has never been anything
564000	568400	other than and I thought this is the best Mad Max movie ever out of all of
568400	572360	them for sure. Well I will say that I that's my opinion. I particularly love
572360	576480	that actor playing Mad Max and I love that performance and it's like I had
576480	579120	heard that he's like oh he's taking a slight backseat because there's this
579120	581960	there's this there's this other sort of thing happening but that's not really
581960	585440	true if you watch all these movies like he's always what I like about Mad Max is
585440	589200	that he's really more canine than human. He's like this and it's
589200	592800	especially like brought out by the Charlize Theron character is that he's
592800	597640	like this like lovable spaniel you know like and that actor was so good at it
597640	603000	was like he just kept reminding me of my dog like it's just like oh but then
603000	607040	like a good movie dog he's not just obedient like the good movie dog is it
607040	612080	turns the plot to the good movie dog all of a sudden is like what is it
612080	618120	what is it the movie's going in one direction dog what do you want which is
618120	621880	what he does no spoilers there it's just also there's a lot of sand and
621880	625800	vehicles if you haven't seen it it's pretty great I don't want to talk about
625800	628520	you you can do you guys are all talking about Mad Max which is great it's a
628520	634700	great movie please enjoy but also like you know Ripley why didn't we make
634700	638040	that big a deal about Ripley because she had to have the panty and bra scene in
638040	642200	Alien yeah because that was like a slasher movie in space she was like
642200	645680	Jamie Lee Curtis running from an alien screaming okay she wasn't really like
645680	652000	but aliens oh she was driven by her uterus I guess she was like I gotta save
652000	657920	that baby because I'm a lady I don't know I went and did a little exploring
657920	661480	online I mean a very little because you get like a little goes a long way of
661480	665200	reading about what the the menonists whatever they call themselves
665200	673000	menonists yeah Mennonites yeah Mennonites on Broadway New York Times
673000	680160	called Mennonites a dashing good time do I do I do I it's like an excerpt
680160	689200	Mennonites have come oh I've got many girls are done but you read a little bit
689200	694600	about it and they're so mad that there's women with agency in a fucking action
694600	697960	movie like what do you want is your stance that you want nothing but sweaty
697960	701640	guys rubbing up against each other the whole movie so I go then what are we
701640	705920	talking about at that point like that you want no women in your movie or they
705920	709680	just have to be props they just have to be damsels in distress they want top gun
709680	714320	they want top gun man yeah they want a lot of beach volleyball baby yeah I
714320	717920	don't know who are they I don't know there's a there's a Mennonite inside all
718240	726240	Mennonites are called Mennonists Mennonites are noble noble weird religion I
726240	730040	think as we move forward we need to start to we're doing a great job
730040	734000	accepting everything and start I think we need to start accepting a little bit
734000	738200	of ignorance there was a there was a there was an article that Emily Gordon
738200	741960	had tweeted that I retweeted she didn't she retweeted it and I retweeted her
741960	747040	tweet tweeted but the headline was something like admit it your fave is
747040	750120	problematic and I think it was sort of like the treatise was sort of like look
750120	754320	a world full of like people you're gonna admire and they're not all gonna be
754320	759040	mentally perfect like some of them are gonna have slight racial like racist
759040	764040	like holdovers from something some of them are gonna need to be edified in
764040	767560	terms of gender like they're not there's a really good you know there's a good
767560	771000	chance that as you you know as you move forward and admire people throughout
771000	779640	your life like a lot of them are gonna disappoint you and if we're gonna
779640	782680	actually fix the world and become like this Roddenberry vision which I think
782680	785440	was like everybody would agree with that even though it seems like a lot of
785440	789400	people want to fight that the real truth is if we're gonna make it there it's
789400	794600	gonna be because we actually get good at like like greeting ignorance and saying
794600	799440	like I know what you are that's okay like like like you you just don't know
799440	803480	some stuff yet and I'm not gonna bully you or reverse bully you or condescend to
803480	807360	you or police you I'm gonna there must be it's challenging I mean it's it's
807360	811200	not and it's not fair but but like it's like what else are we gonna do beat them
811200	816560	up like what are we gonna do yes we're gonna beat them up somebody so I mean it
816560	820160	feels good after if you happen to be somebody that was bullied in your life
820160	823640	of course it feels good to finally like flip them over and spit in their face
823640	828040	but but you know maybe we can do that for a little bit but then I keep saying we
828040	833520	like the oppressed people unite but I mean I was I was a you know I was part
833520	839520	of a group in the 70s called the kids that throw like a girl and and who smell
839520	844200	like sewage although you know it wasn't born that way I could have done something
844200	854200	about that I presented as sewage and I and I was judged for it all right
854200	865480	anyways whatever Harmon shut your fucking hole but then keep talking okay
865480	868200	so let's bring faucets back I just want to make this quick let's bring faucets
868200	871280	back in public bathrooms obviously we don't have the motion detection
871280	878200	technology it's obviously obviously that needs another five years in the oven
878200	882440	it's not working it doesn't know when your hands are under the thing and by
882440	888840	the way I'm not a biologist but the day a germ can live on cold metal I think
888840	894760	we're gonna be dead before you go to a public bathroom yeah because the shit's
894760	900200	gonna be like everywhere like like germs tend to like like you know moist warm
900200	904560	biological places like the ones that can really hurt you what I think there's not
904560	907800	gonna be one sitting on a doorknob going like I can't wait to get inside your
907800	912760	body and kill you like just look you know I feel like anything that you touch
912760	918440	until you you finish washing your hands is it like don't don't Hannah are you
918440	930920	already done Hannah the seamstress everybody okay all right okay all right
930920	939880	one more thing and I want to bring up bring up our first cast thank you Hannah
939880	947640	that's very lovely dude why did I write the voicemail oh oh yeah that's approach
947640	953200	yes that's a good button that's gonna last for a while yeah I guess I could
953200	957560	try this does it there's got to be someone here who speaks Spanish we find
957560	960320	out there's no there's no British people last week but I speak a touch of
960320	962840	Spanish do we need do we need lots of Spanish you can see what this guy's
962840	966560	saying over there this is I don't know if you'll be able to hear what the
966560	978080	Amazon Megan Megan okay she okay this is a this is a this is a voicemail I got
978080	981320	today when I didn't pick up I gotta do we need do we need Megan editor
981320	984960	translate or well that's how I'm seeing if she if she can hear this okay this
984960	989600	makes it through the speaker system but it's it's it's kind of let's see if this
989600	1004880	works here you want to plug it into I can wire you in yeah that might have
1004880	1010120	been Arabic yeah I might have been like pseudo racist to me to assume that was
1010120	1014400	Spanish I don't even know because whoever whatever language he's speaking
1014400	1018720	he's mumbling in it did the alarming thing you can't hear is that there's a
1018720	1022320	there's like a really sharp child's cough at a certain point it's like hey
1022320	1029280	oh yeah so I'm like I'm like do you know that you just called a fat white
1029280	1034560	comic that can't I'm not a comic why am I like comic should we try plugging in
1034560	1038640	any kid there's a bag is like oh you're a comic now do you want to try plugging
1038640	1041280	in and hearing that with better fidelity we can try to figure this out I don't
1041280	1048320	know how worth it that is I'm curious was that was that the wrong number no
1048320	1060080	it was it was a perfect number he nailed it he called exactly the right
1060080	1066680	guy I am life-flighting his kid to the whooping cough center yes it's a rug no
1066680	1069760	I don't even know what language he's speaking maybe maybe your car was in the
1069760	1074560	shop and the guy was calling it back seen your car is ready or something man
1074560	1079840	my car is gonna be in the shop forever they need to switch departments that guy
1079840	1083760	should be working on my air filter I want to hear it again play it again okay
1083760	1089800	but I really okay all right I think everybody very quiet I just I'm 42 and
1089800	1109640	it's an iPhone give me a second did you hear the kid I'm really concerned that
1109640	1114420	I don't know how to get this guy back it's not a listed number hello Dr.
1114420	1123380	Harmon at the tuberculosis society my child is not gonna die bye if you if you
1123380	1131380	don't call back I'll assume she's okay she's turning green I'm not convinced
1131380	1137180	that's Spanish that's not Spanish you heard TARDIS it could have been it could
1137180	1150300	have been cut to Catalan right maybe yeah what's that it's cactus from cactus
1150300	1153100	bunch oh the cactus that is that what they're doing a call back to cactus
1153100	1160860	bunch that's a deep cut where the cactus bunch isn't here right I think the
1160860	1163860	thing about the cactus bunch is the cactus bunch is also 40 years old right
1163860	1167060	now I would like to go hang out and have a drink with the cactus bunch I have and
1167060	1171140	ask him at the time they took my paisley bandana off me and one of wanted me to
1171140	1176820	fight them for it I think I think I'm most scared out of all the gangbangers
1176820	1181600	I think I'm most scared of Latino ones
1182060	1189660	whispering doesn't make this not recorded all right all right well let's
1189660	1194780	let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's bring up a friend that I've
1194780	1199940	been wanting to come up here for a long time he needs no introduction which is a
1199940	1203660	good thing because I'm bad at them he's an amazing comment Senator Bernie

1307900	1314500	it gets on me that's what they were like it was easy back then you guys knew what
1314500	1318140	to do back then what will this Robin Williams think of next they said back
1318140	1326420	then too soon too late too soon I'm going to do this joke every night I'm
1326420	1331300	on stage for the rest of my life every night I've done it every night so far
1331300	1340160	and I will do it again who died and made Jim Belushi a big star I do the long
1340160	1345100	stare if there's I've stolen many of your jokes and borrowed them in
1345100	1348220	conversation or whatever but there's nothing I've stolen more than when you
1348220	1353300	say a punch line and hold it and that's built on a tradition of thousands of
1353300	1358140	years of Catskills comic thousands of years fuck it thousands of years back in
1358140	1365460	the idea the code of Hammurabi there was a code of Hammurabi that's Karnak I'm
1365460	1373540	doing I think last week to abject silence they don't know anything
1373540	1381540	profound you were I saw in the final montage of the letterman goodbye you
1381540	1388180	popped up between like two presidents I can't follow Obama that was a joke at
1388180	1393300	one point no I couldn't believe it it was totally thrilled did you I thought I
1393300	1396540	saw I thought I saw even you're sometimes you're a dry guy but sometimes
1396540	1400140	you're a very sincere guy like on Twitter like like you and I are we're
1400140	1403340	old guys on Twitter so and one of the things I was thrilled to talk to you
1403340	1407580	about is like how cuz I and the thing that really endeared you to me whereas
1407580	1410220	otherwise you'd just be that really really funny guy and sometimes it's easy
1410220	1413860	to hate that guy cuz you're like fuck that really funny guy I often hate
1413860	1423100	myself because I'm so funny but you but you bother you bother to argue with
1423100	1426820	people on Twitter like about ideological stuff like like people pick on you about
1426820	1430540	not being an atheist and you push back and go like right and you came to my
1430540	1435700	defense with the best thing and what would you say the you said if you're I
1435700	1438500	can't remember they were like something if you if you don't believe in God it's
1438500	1441660	one thing but if you if you're saying yeah I said well I said to these kids
1441660	1444820	that were they were picking on you guys and I think you're mistaking atheism
1444820	1449500	which is I have no God for antagonism which is you have no God exactly and
1449500	1454340	then that got retweeted so much and then there's just strangers like I posited
1454340	1457580	that like I'm fucking Plato like I didn't I didn't I didn't say that on the
1457580	1461900	mount I was saying that to these three that were like shaking down Andy for his
1461900	1467540	lunch money because he dares to have a connection to the fucking cosmos it's
1467540	1472700	like first of all if you're 20 shut the fuck up about religion or about my lack
1472700	1476220	of it are you kidding me you have you were closer to birth worship your
1476220	1487820	mother's vagina lately I have his mother that's what made that joke work I'm not
1487820	1492380	doing no well you're you're absolutely right and here's the thing is that this
1492380	1495740	is the whole topic is enraged me but it also mixes up a lot of different things
1495740	1499100	which is like people like uh like I'll give you an example of how a lot of these
1499100	1503020	atheists first of all they drives them I don't care if you're atheist most of my
1503020	1508460	friends are atheists my dad was agnostic lean to I don't like some some comic who
1508460	1511420	I'm no longer friends with was talking about how uh it's hard to be you know
1511420	1515380	you get oppressed if you're an atheist you're oppressed as an atheist in
1515380	1520300	America show me where you're you'd have to move to Alabama and specifically walk
1520300	1526780	around go there's no God you Jesus love and piece of garbage that was a bad
1526780	1533260	example but the point is so um so but this is an example of how some of these
1533260	1537580	people's minds work someone was arguing me and they said uh they always say that
1537580	1542620	religion causes you know the Quranic causes people to become violent so I
1542620	1546820	said well uh stop you know Stalin was an atheist and then they go then the guy
1546820	1553180	comes back oh you're saying atheism causes of us no I'm saying none of it
1553180	1557340	causes violence so it's like they claim to be brilliant but they're not even
1557340	1561060	using their own logic there's a lot of it yeah I feel like I'm sorry I got so
1561060	1565300	excited about nothing it's all right we have an understanding I mean I bet if I
1565300	1567860	asked all the atheists to stand up I don't want to risk it because they might
1567860	1574100	go well I'm standing let's walk out yeah but I mean I always like like I'm
1574100	1577460	just a Joseph Campbell guy and I was like like I was I was an atheist slash
1577460	1581260	agnostic to until I started writing and started having writers block them and
1581260	1584020	discovered Campbell was reading this and I'm like the guy grew up a Catholic
1584020	1590620	Boy Scout and he was smart and and and he the value of mythology in your life
1590620	1596220	is like that's all I care about like I always say to people if you're gonna pop
1596220	1604620	Tom Tom Hanks is volleyball what are you gonna replace it with castaway they
1604620	1616580	don't even born after that movie came out the thing is like the thing is the
1616580	1619940	worst thing there is no sign and they drives me crazy I go there's absolutely
1619940	1624100	there's zero science in atheism nothing it's nothing scientific because first of
1624100	1630660	all unless you're eight years old or 12 years old of course we're not talking
1630660	1634340	about people literally believe the Bible is true those are fundamentalists
1634340	1638020	nobody believes fundamentalists what they believe in although I've met a lot
1638020	1641660	of nice fundamentalists I mean then there's fundamentalists who will tell
1641660	1645300	you you're bad for for being gay but the point is you can't say something isn't
1645300	1649860	true when the word God I use it to describe something I can't describe I'm
1649860	1653820	not even saying what it is I'm just saying I did LSD in college I've had a
1653820	1659700	I've written music I you know on stage you get into into a zone I take
1659700	1664420	martial arts they call it no mind the root of so many things in life
1664420	1669420	meditation is a belief in some kind of transcendent experience and you can't
1669420	1673420	and it seems like ridiculous that these people live in their little head they
1673420	1676020	really think that that's where they're gonna be able to figure out everything
1676020	1679580	science has nothing to say about the kind of things that I'm talking about
1679580	1684980	right exactly I'm not missed I'm not saying the world's 3,000 years old or
1684980	1688740	creationism it's like there's no scientific thing that could come out
1689260	1693380	where I would go okay I was wrong right and then there is no love and there's a
1693380	1697180	look there's a there's a larger scale on which it's like oh my god well are you
1697180	1699820	do you know that people used to put leeches on people and burn people at
1699820	1705540	the stake at all stuff it's like yeah and and in that scale we've won there's
1705540	1709460	bigger skyscrapers than churches on every skyline there's like no place where
1709460	1713100	there's like crucifixes everywhere and you get whipped for anything if you
1713100	1717500	don't believe in anything like we're winning we're we're it's it's it's on
1717500	1722180	schedule like like the death of religion it's fine we're fine I can't
1722180	1725620	believe I've ever had to defend organized religion I mean I'm not even
1725620	1728940	defending I'm not defending you know they're worse than anybody anything with
1728940	1731860	a name on it they can go fuck themselves but wouldn't you rather hang out with the
1731860	1736940	Pope than Bill Maher I would absolutely well this Pope I'd rather hang out with
1736940	1743460	this little Murray this Pope is like a fucking terrorist he's amazing that's
1743460	1747460	like the biggest compliment I can give a Pope he's like a terrorist he knows what
1748420	1751980	he means like every other day you turn on NPR it's like the Pope the Pope said
1751980	1755700	the people who hate gay people are going to hell it's like he's just sort of like
1755700	1760100	I don't know he didn't say that but like I mean like boy they really put a they
1760100	1765220	put a firecracker in the old Pope seat yeah yeah he's good the Pope was in West
1765220	1771460	Hollywood last night doing poppers he's good he's not normally a papal person
1771460	1775740	I've done that joke I've done it before they love it they love it it's my joke
1775980	1786900	I've done it before Jesus he actually hit that was that was actual physical
1786900	1790940	violence on the show for the first time I thought I can't believe I actually hit
1790940	1794700	him with a piece of paper we've had some screwballs up here and that was the first
1794700	1799980	physical violent act it was physical comedy well I'll give you a perfect
1799980	1805820	example it's like I say online I say online I don't know I don't know anything
1805820	1808620	about I don't know anything about Charlie Hebdo I've seen a couple of
1808620	1813860	cartoons with a showing Muhammad easy dude you don't know what I'm gonna say
1813860	1817700	okay what were you let oh don't even start no I don't know anything about
1817700	1821660	Joe I've seen a couple of cartoons where there were Muhammad's balls you want a
1821660	1825100	piece of paper and a pen to draw a Mohammed right no I don't I know but the
1825100	1828980	point is I say look just because of course you know they they go well I
1828980	1832420	don't know if Charlie Hebdo I don't know if their cartoons were racist I
1832420	1835100	don't know I just don't know they go well they shouldn't have been murdered
1835100	1839180	yes I can't we stipulate that I'm against murder not pro-murder has there
1839180	1842340	anything I've ever said to you or you and you're not saying you're gonna kill
1842340	1845260	that guy because you cut you off in traffic but the point is if you can't
1845260	1848780	have a discussion about that there are certain things in the world like those
1848780	1853100	Danish guy that Van Gogh guy who did get killed but there's a lot of people
1853100	1858820	provoking people who are not in the power position in their country and we
1858820	1862940	can't have a discussion about it and some of Russia's gonna say because some
1862940	1865860	people didn't want them to get a pet award that they have no character that's
1865860	1868780	where it's like you know you have a discussion if you're telling me there's
1868780	1874020	no validity to my position because you can't murder a cartoonist I why I'm
1874020	1880060	against murdering cartoonists they should not be murdered Andy Andy if you
1880060	1888540	think you've murdering cartoonist count to ten and it's well documented that
1888540	1891900	you've been soft on murder for a long time I know that's not true it's a
1891900	1897620	couple of times people and I wasn't sorry about it I will confess that that I
1897620	1902500	have been very I refrained from ever speaking about the hepto thing because
1902500	1910900	I've been so confused about it because I am a rabid mouth foaming I want to say
1910900	1915100	First Amendment guy because I don't think you know the freedom of speech is
1915100	1918420	something you get from a lawyer I think it's something you get by virtue of your
1918420	1922580	humanity but I'm like anybody ever trying to stop blah blah blah but the
1922580	1926300	thing is that I had to realize I think you retweeted an article was it you yes
1926300	1932060	where all the all the French Muslims that was just sounding off oh yeah they
1932060	1935340	asked a different they just it was it was a Vice magazine article and they
1935340	1939580	they they just all it was was it no agenda to the article except that it was
1939580	1946700	just a bunch of of French Islamic individuals like commenting on the
1946700	1951940	situation by virtue of being asked by this journalist and I was like just I
1951940	1956060	just read it and I kind of like got this more distant view and started I was like
1956060	1959180	oh my god I got caught up in that age-old thing that I'm always railing
1959180	1963060	against which is so much easier to recognize within the country where you're
1963060	1966740	being at where you're being told falsely that you have to choose between two
1966740	1971140	things that you have to choose between whether you love freedom or love
1971140	1977700	terrorism like I got I mean me old genius pants that old genius pants I got
1977700	1981980	I got ice I was like I don't understand it's like I don't I mean anybody who's
1981980	1986260	who shoots anybody's a fucking bully and so we should just always like fucking
1986260	1989660	gather around and do whatever we have to and blah blah blah but yeah yes you can
1989660	1993500	still feel that way but you can also be equally passionate about everybody being
1993500	1997020	respected all the time this isn't this isn't something that's up for referendum
1997020	2000700	anywhere you know it's not it's you don't have to choose salt or pepper like
2000700	2005140	anything you can be like the potatoes need some salt the pepper needs a some
2005140	2009540	salt and the salt needs some pepper and then and then both the other potato need
2009540	2014780	some salt and pepper no but for example Bill Mark will quote Bill Mark who is a
2014780	2020300	horrible person he will quote he will quote he will say 70% of you know
2020300	2025380	according to a Pew poll in Syria or whatever 70% of Muslims hate those
2025380	2030300	cartoons what does that mean they're allowed to hate the cartoons you're
2030300	2034980	allowed to draw the cartoons I'm allowed to say I can't I hate them and it seems
2034980	2040160	to me I didn't see a lot of these people arguing about having mosques near 9-11
2040160	2043700	you know I'm saying everything and you that's also freedom of expression so
2043700	2048140	everybody's freedom of expression is based on where you are in your life so I
2048140	2051820	somebody my friends have got they're almost like jumped up from the table
2051820	2056180	because they're artists so that's all they see right in that moment it's so
2056180	2063300	important to see that but murder is wrong it's a little family circus that
2063300	2074180	guy should be allowed to walk around you say I measure of the extremity of
2074180	2079540	artists support are you coming are you coming down in favor of murdering Bill
2079540	2084860	Keene family's family that for a minute I got a little angry he's expressing his
2084860	2088540	belief in murder to the extent that he's willing to say Bill Keene should be
2088540	2093500	walking around among us breathing our air Wow that's tolerance that is very
2093500	2099740	tough hard-carrying non-murderer you think when Garfield doesn't like Mondays
2099740	2105740	I don't want to rip my head you don't think I want to send Jim Davis to the
2105740	2124980	eternal Monday of to the lasagna of hell yes I do I want to be the guy who
2124980	2128900	gives us opinion is not afraid to say anything but everybody has to love me
2128900	2134820	yeah that's all just love Andy that's it so all right so let's talk about
2134820	2142620	comedy anyway what is this you did a great thing for I think several years at
2142620	2146500	the just for laughs festival in Montreal the state of the industry address which
2146500	2150300	was hilarious what do you think the state of comedy is right now well I
2150300	2154180	think the state of well first of all when you have a mr. James cordon who
2154180	2159380	they don't even know we I honestly don't either he does the fish sticks
2159380	2163740	right no I used to make fun I used to go with this make this speech and nobody
2163740	2169180	even knows the references okay I love the show B roll with Carson Daly have
2169180	2174300	you seen that show all right so the cars don't even doesn't have time to be on
2174300	2179140	his own show anymore he doesn't do with the interviews on his show he is he
2179140	2183820	throws to to comedians who are who put their own segments together why are you
2183820	2190860	not outraged by this then we have the comedians Josh Gad is literally he's in
2190860	2194820	everything he's in everything I opened up my mailbox this morning Josh Gad
2194820	2200300	popped out he physically popped out it pales and have you seen the comedians
2200300	2206460	yes it's behind the scenes of vaudeville is what it is and and Josh Gad
2206460	2210500	said that Billy Crystal is an encyclopedia of comedy he didn't say
2210500	2221580	that he's a 1957 world book Adam Sandler did I say on the movie they
2221580	2227820	walked off the set of the movie without even the writers of f-troop sent them a
2227820	2233260	note and said they don't even know what Adam Sandler you don't know Adam Sandler
2233260	2245140	is in production hello no no I'd like to drown in my own sorrow sometimes
2245140	2257500	non sequiturs don't work I mean I would assume that you would agree that Ricky
2257500	2260260	Gervais is that what you look at your base I didn't know you were on to
2260260	2265260	something Ricky Gervais okay Ricky Gervais spends half of his Twitter feed
2265260	2270340	talking about how what an atheist he is although he doesn't even understand the
2270340	2274260	basic tenets of monotheism someone goes oh he goes what God do you believe in
2274260	2278180	like we've already settled that whatever it is that people are sensing it's all
2278180	2282220	the same thing of youth with different cultures but this idiot doesn't even
2282220	2285820	know what he's talking about so half of his feeds about that and then the other
2285820	2289980	half of his feed is about how he doesn't care what people say about him half of
2290020	2300060	his tweets and I want to know can I get a price on Netflix without Derek one
2300060	2306740	more time one more time give me one more without Derek better than without Derek
2306740	2313700	what's the price without Derek the jokes up there Dan oh and you're bringing it
2313700	2317660	down yeah without Derek it's like it's like frosting and we're like gonna we're
2317660	2320780	like in a gingerbread house and you're I'm painting a picture for the people
2320780	2324380	okay and then always if it doesn't get big enough laugh you say something in
2324380	2329940	between the jokes like pretty frightening stuff people I think I'm
2329940	2334040	making I'm making you sick no no I'm such a bad interviewer that sometimes if
2334040	2336620	you look over at me I'm thinking about what I should ask you this is not
2336620	2341020	making you comfortable let's do this let's do that now you said you think I
2341020	2344260	would you I was gonna say I would imagine you might agree or would or
2344260	2347100	would tweak this observation that there was a certain point in time when a
2347100	2351660	certain kind of I always call it the apple on the apple on the teacher's desk
2351660	2361820	school of comedy see I mean let me finish if you like laid on me yes yes I
2361820	2366740	will say yes yes Fallon fully represents that lately it's the it's like the it's
2366740	2371220	the mistaking fun for funny and it's also the sort of like like like kind of
2371220	2376540	like a comedian's job isn't to upset people which I don't agree with I feel
2376540	2381740	like a comedian should not be allowed to be pals with a politician I think you
2381740	2385460	should I don't like you should definitely like feel that there's like a
2385460	2390780	red flag happening there if like Ted Cruz is a nice man and we don't talk we
2390780	2395260	play golf we don't talk politics and I
2398140	2403620	huh funnier here funnier there no I know what you mean though but also that's
2403620	2407660	why letterman was so amazing was because he was himself right it's funny
2407660	2411740	when you yourself curmudgeoned Andy Rooney is still complaining about his
2411740	2419140	coffin why is my why are my eyebrows still growing why didn't I get myself
2419140	2425100	cremated I don't think eyebrows should keep growing after you die I think they
2425100	2432180	should stop I don't know why there's a top on the coffin why is there a lid on
2432180	2440100	here no one's gonna open this up look at me where am I gonna go I don't know
2440100	2444900	where to be I don't need more lining I understand they needed to put my body
2444900	2450740	in but they could have welded it shut actually now that I'm thinking about it
2450740	2460000	out loud I guess a lid makes sense goodbye I'm dead Andy Rooney I found my
2460000	2466560	piece I would love I would love it that if 60 minutes was edgy they would they
2466560	2475080	would have a dead Andy Rooney at the end of every episode is it like I perceived
2475080	2480760	the shift toward the Apple on the desk philosophy of comedy as coming around
2480760	2485600	Chris Farley's death because I felt like it was just one too many for everybody
2485600	2489400	and then there was a certain like takeover of like okay now let's have the
2489400	2492280	activities committee what do you have on the desk I don't understand I just
2492280	2495920	mean like like like hey who's your favorite student let's it's me what were
2495920	2507040	you homeschooled you know how in high school there were the kids that put
2507040	2513920	together the pep rally and they would like and then mr. Simmons from
2513920	2517520	chemistry would come out and he would like slip-sync to an Elvis song and then
2517520	2521200	he would and then Jeremy would come out who's famous for his mullet and then
2521200	2525040	they'd cut his mullet cuz he said he'd cut it if they didn't win homecoming and
2525040	2530440	it's like everyone's like it's like this fusion of popularity and comedy but
2530440	2533440	it's not really comedy like the kids that are smoking joints under the
2533440	2538160	bleachers like they're not all funny either but like a comedian should come
2538160	2544480	from the dirt right they shouldn't come from like popular like crops of people
2544480	2549280	and I felt like the edginess and that association with drugs it's always been
2549280	2552880	there and it's always been like sort of a sad but realistic like kind of thing
2552880	2556480	is it's like comedians are terrible tortured people they they're they're in
2556480	2561000	a lot of they're in a lot of pain they self medicate and like so there's like
2561000	2563840	you know as with as with musicians there's just always been this kind of
2563840	2568720	like okay this comedian like like you know kind of like he's allowed to say
2568720	2571360	shit that no one else is allowed to say and he catches flack for it but he
2571360	2574240	doesn't give a fuck and that's that's the comedian station and oh he overdosed
2574240	2580640	and like the it's not no one specific we're talking about also also not pro
2580640	2589200	overdose maybe it's my oh like I tipped a glass of milk I guess is maybe you're
2590000	2594720	drowned in a pool of his own cocaine
2609840	2615120	here's our own pool of cocaine you know a lot of times it's not what some people say funny
2615120	2618400	things funny but funny people say funny thing things
2620080	2623680	have you ever heard that one and you say these go they used to hear that one all
2623680	2627680	the time like is that a bromide oh yeah yeah some people say funny things right
2627680	2632160	comics there was a comic say funny comedians say funny things comics say
2632160	2636160	oh say things funny say things funny right dumb right Adam Carolla is racist
2636880	2639520	I didn't say you said that
2639520	2645920	Andy Kindler is saying you guys said you did it why would you bring that but I'll
2645920	2651440	tell you silence is consent when you when you're such right you think he's you like
2651440	2657280	racist you're a pro racism you back you you sons of when I was back there and you said uh
2657280	2662720	about you said you weren't a comic right okay now this is I mean he is a comedian
2662720	2668320	but the the idea like these people like Corolla or they all of a sudden think or
2668320	2672640	Gervais is another example Gervais thinks he's the funniest stand-up comedian in the world
2672640	2678640	what is what is wrong with your ego that you think because you've done stand-up 15 or 20 times
2678640	2683920	and it's like to have humility you have humility it's like you know you're funny but you know
2683920	2687200	you know there's a certain and these people and I can't put sentences what do you know
2688160	2693200	but yeah you and Patton Oswalt sit there and it's like fucking like yeah you have you know you
2693200	2697840	work for 10 years and the result is like a strong 15 I think I just insulted you guys
2699840	2706960	it's a struck 11 uh no but but I mean it's like it's fucking like I mean you torture yourselves
2706960	2710800	and you like and you work it and blah blah blah and it's like this podcasting age is a great thing
2710800	2715440	but I sense like with Kumail Nanjiani too it's like like like I'm about to go on stage and I'll go
2715440	2720000	like or Duncan Trussell too has like been working on the road and the last time and he's sort of
2720080	2725280	become a podcast star but it's like his podcast audience is way bigger than his comedian following
2725280	2729760	I think so if it goes on tour with his podcast he drives these huge crowds for no effort at all
2729760	2734160	but if he's like just touring as a stand-up it's sort of like oh he does stand-up and I remember
2734160	2738960	saying to Duncan before going on stage it was like do you are you mad about the last 20 years
2738960	2745360	that we spent and he's like yeah you know what I am yeah yeah that's really fucking enraging
2745360	2749920	because he's a very happy guy that's a good one Duncan Trussell uh but but anyways yeah I don't
2749920	2753360	know I'm just babbling about that and my thing is there's no value judgment but you know it's like
2753360	2757840	that did you see that thing where Ricky Gervais was on with like Chris Rock and those guys and
2757840	2763680	Louis CK and and the ball talking about comedy and the fact that Ricky Gervais he's a narcissist
2763680	2768080	he had a thing on twitter once my favorite example of someone who was so full of himself
2768080	2772720	he said this is the only trophy hunting I believe in because he's you know he's doing animal rights
2772720	2779120	things and he's standing in front of a case with his trophies in it no and and I forced him to
2779120	2783760	change his twitter bio I absolutely absolutely am convinced of it because his twitter bio said
2783760	2793280	multi-baptist winning 16 me uh deserving uh writer producer actor singer I mean literally
2793280	2801200	and he goes and a one-trick pony with a smiley face he doesn't you can't be a comedian and not
2801200	2807760	realize and not have any self-awareness and I love the original office boy is my face red
2810320	2812800	I guess Steven Merchant was responsible
2816320	2821600	he is that character yeah I mean uh who's the guy you think Merchant is uh
2822800	2827520	whatever Ricky Gervais maybe has a soul of some kind but Ricky Gervais is that character
2828240	2836000	yeah he's not playing uh yeah interesting so so so okay but he meant interesting
2836000	2840000	I know I really did mean it um the the uh I say intriguing
2843120	2849760	it's not a competition um the um that's how you look at it score one for Kindler
2849760	2858400	one I guess I guess we've already we've already circled this I kind of wanted to ask you this
2858400	2862800	because you were you would be the only person that I would trust with this to answer this question
2863440	2869680	in a in an edifying way no pressure but also it's kind of a dumb question but but so don't answer
2869680	2876080	it but who is who is Copernicus uh doctors have this sort of central oath they have the
2876080	2881600	Hippocratic oath they have they can sum up their whole shtick in one thing like I gotta heal
2881600	2887440	people that's what I do that's my gimmick I'm a doctor and like whether I work on toes or noses
2888000	2893200	or or a little bit of both I'm not supposed to do any harm is there is there it's hard to find
2893200	2898880	a good toe in those doctors no we have to hold the doctors have an oath because we had to like
2898880	2901840	you know we had to shake them down for one at some point because otherwise they could just be like
2901920	2908400	the leeches and yeah cut off one of your arms and see if that helps maybe we should have a do no
2908400	2916400	harm thing uh yeah because dr schmek dr mangle is gonna stop it before they're I can't reference
2916400	2927920	dr mangle he's not alive it's it's not a pro are they pro dr mangle it's it's they're they're
2927920	2932640	anti irony this generation they're this kind of like I don't know there's no such thing as context
2932640	2938160	because because because bad people abuse the concepts of context and irony yes that's true
2938160	2943840	to be genuinely like bad people they say so then we go like what about context what about irony and
2943840	2950640	they're like I heard that from old man carothers and he's racist so you're racist too good logic
2950640	2959520	you little fucking hologram shithead um this is gonna be being six months look you atheist piece
2959520	2965920	of shit is there a comedic oath is it would there be what would it be if there was one obviously
2965920	2971040	there isn't one because there's a lot of like bad bad bad approaches to comedy like like me
2971040	2976240	personally observing it's like just like I don't think you should be doing comedy to get applause
2976240	2981680	or even necessarily smiles I think the comedy definitely heals more people and makes them feel
2981680	2986880	better in the long run uh but but okay so I've always babbled about this but the first it's
2986880	2992480	important the first joke this is a theory an anthropological theory the first the first joke
2992480	2999200	that we hear is peekaboo and it's like it's half terror your mom is abusing your infantile instinct
2999200	3004800	to shriek in terror when your mom's face goes away and then she's going I'm in on it too
3004800	3009040	death is a joke and you're like I don't know what the fuck this world is this is insane
3010240	3016320	so like half of a comedian's job is if you're dwelling in the world of comedy you get one foot
3016320	3021120	in the river sticks you know then you'd forget everything all right ancient greek majors
3022720	3028880	maybe if your mother wasn't holding a knife she was doing it um but you get you get you get a
3028960	3034480	bag you get a bag you're in that i want to hear more ancient greek capsule comedy
3037520	3047200	easy sisyphus uh work a little harder i can't think of one greek name hey hey
3047200	3051440	hey tantalus i have a i have a mic you you can't reach your beer god has a plan
3051440	3060160	ichorous and the ichorous maybe you shouldn't name your comedy uh duo the ilean and the odyssey
3060160	3069120	i don't know is that even greek yes i like the kind of people like yes yes old man read something
3070000	3073840	i do here's my oath yeah i do have an oath here's the thing the thing i think i hate more than
3073840	3077360	anything else and i'm sure you agree with this is when people say hey if they laugh you know
3077360	3082400	people are laughing it's funny well that's just objectively wrong you can't say comedy is not
3082400	3088240	subjective in the sense like saying if people are sneezing you're sick right or allergic or anything
3088240	3092960	there's a lot of reasons to sneeze we may disagree on what's funny but it doesn't mean
3092960	3098160	that because people can get some of the laugh it's funny because that was what got me uh where
3098160	3103200	i wrote this hack handbook which still is available on my website where nothing ever changes
3104080	3113760	is who's sick and tired of all these different dates so uh they keep changing them uh but i don't
3113760	3119440	know what i'm saying oh uh your oath at the hack the hack handbook yeah what was the sentence before
3119440	3126560	that he said you had an oath oh well okay so if you if you're in a club and i say are you are you
3126560	3130720	working tonight we'll get your feet off the stage like in the in the 80s any kind of you get a laugh
3130800	3136720	doing that and the crowd would laugh you've never heard it before so it's up to the comedian to have
3136720	3142000	take the responsibility that he knows that his material is original that he's not doing something
3142000	3147600	hack if but a lot of and like when i was in the 90s when they had the first you know quote alternative
3147600	3151760	scenes since the late 70s which is the real alternative explosion with letterman all these
3151760	3157440	people like um we were all people like me were all squeezed out of like uh janine garoflow all
3157440	3161040	these people we couldn't play comedy clubs because it was just filled with hacks who just
3161040	3166560	play to the audience so i think the oath is that you can't you have to go with what you believe is
3166560	3172160	funny and for me the big breakthrough but i don't know this is no the big breakthrough came 23 years
3172160	3179120	in uh when i realized that i really i thought i was always saying what was on my mind but i realized
3179120	3185040	i wasn't i was going to like stock things about it like i hate the crowd or i hate myself and that
3185040	3190480	was the big breakthrough and so that's kind of my oath is is when things go bad just to really try
3190480	3196160	and be in the moment right but i don't know just step back and uh yeah and and and remind yourself
3196160	3201040	that yeah if you're if you're not making yourself laugh if you're not saying something you genuinely
3201040	3205200	feel is funny then you're you you could still be wrong you could say something that you genuinely
3205200	3208720	think is funny and find out that you're racist on monday night and then you're like read about it
3208720	3212240	for three days and go like come back on thursday like you know what i was racist on monday and i
3212240	3218160	found out um but but you so you you but unless you're saying what you genuinely think is funny
3218160	3222720	you're never ever ever gonna you're never gonna be funny because you could you could make people
3222720	3226880	laugh you could buy it by going like for the wrong reasons yeah i'm gonna use this got milk
3226880	3233280	formula everyone's using i'm gonna say got come um and see i gotta chuckle and dick like dick for
3233280	3237600	example dick jokes and that's why you can't make any rules because dick jokes are an easy way to
3237600	3242080	get people to laugh but then there's always one person like any rule you would make and then you
3242080	3247920	see david tell for 10 minutes be the so like the hilarious no one's funnier than him you can't make
3247920	3251920	any rules so that's why right when politically correct things come down or you know when they
3251920	3256720	wouldn't have to call bear right so terrible because obviously we know he's hilarious but
3256720	3260960	that doesn't mean that i never bought the thing where when you're on stage it's a magic eraser
3260960	3264640	zone you can say anything you want you're a comedian should have a conscience you should be
3264640	3269360	able to say if you think you're wrong i was wrong i hate that the comics are saying or many
3269360	3274160	would say you should never apologize you should never you should you should always evaluate what
3274160	3278400	you're doing right right i thought it was really refreshing do you remember when natasha logero uh
3278400	3283360	did the thing about she did some pearl harbor joke about uh they're so old yeah yeah but then
3283360	3287600	her anti-apology like it's a case by case basis is what you say but like that was such a fucking
3287600	3293440	great day for me i like springing my step like because she just she said i'm not sorry because
3293440	3297920	and i shouldn't be and it's not defiance and it's not it's just like yeah this is not because we
3297920	3302400	we are over apologizing blah blah blah but what you're saying is sometimes you know but you don't
3302400	3306480	have to have that hard line a comedian doesn't we can't we can't go like we're comedians we're not
3306480	3311600	going to apologize it's like i i've i've like i've been doing this podcast i talk two hours a week
3311600	3317840	i have no material i'm babbling i'm drunk i have like bruised people and i have i've been told
3317840	3322800	that i have bruised them on twitter and i have them even in that moment going like go fuck yourself
3322800	3328080	because i'm human and i don't like being told that i did something wrong but like inevitably
3328080	3333040	i'm like you know i did something wrong like that's really cool i could have done that differently
3333040	3337920	you know but i didn't because i wasn't i wasn't thinking the right way and that is a pr thing you
3337920	3343200	just want to you just want to oh no it's a pr thing but but no no my people my people say the
3343200	3348560	same thing but you're talking speaking of pr i mean to take it into this area like you but part
3348560	3354320	of your persona is the reason that we know that when you that you really follow that credo is
3354320	3360800	because in the brief time you've been up here you have i mean i also do not like bill marr i also
3361760	3366400	i also was thinking of jimmy fallon when you said i was thinking of jimmy fallon i also
3367040	3372160	like i didn't know adam carola was racist but i uh i'm willing but i'm willing to believe you
3372240	3382080	um i i i like i you you uh you you you you go there as as the girls say i do go there and the
3382080	3387440	thing is everything to everything like okay so i have a joke like i say i have a joke i say
3387440	3390880	jay Leno has a car that runs on the energy of all the people's dreams of these crimes
3394560	3399840	and i kind of do i kind of really don't like uh jay Leno but bill marr's in a completely different
3399840	3407200	category because i'm very sensitive to the anti that people should not hate people based on i was
3407200	3411440	raised you don't hate people based on their religion you know the thing that really pisses
3411440	3416960	me off about bill marr is all of his his dogmatic stuff like he has a religion it's atheism and he
3416960	3421520	right and he says fundamentalist and and dogmatic about that absolutely you could possibly be about
3421520	3426000	any fucking thing else and now which would be fine if he were more charming about it but he
3426880	3429360	charm is not what bill marr deals in it's 9 11
3433920	3434880	sorry we uh
3438880	3441040	that is the greatest thing i've ever seen in my life
3442720	3447840	Andy we're the only show that people cheer where you go it's 9 11 oh my god you do that
3447840	3451200	how do you eat some lunch don't you miss it sometimes or you ever sometimes we miss it
3451200	3456240	and boy in the morning i'm like god damn it uh but but it happens again like in the a.m it's
3456240	3461200	amazing uh anyways all right back back to the there was one time of bill marr one time we did
3461200	3468000	it we did like a sweet sexy ass r and b song about 9 11 yeah it was i was we were thinking
3468000	3472080	because we were keeping we should have a tradition at 9 11 but then it started to get feel creepy
3473520	3477440	because i think the number's funny you know what i mean like it's not three thousand people
3477440	3484240	dang isn't that funny i am against it i'm against it the number the idea of a number being sacred is
3484240	3488240	funny they shouldn't have taken down the towers no they should not have clearly doesn't believe
3488240	3491200	that they should have they should have counted to 10 you're right if you are
3493920	3495360	you know what count to 11 yeah
3497680	3505120	too soon too late 10 is right in between 9 and 11 right in between them they just missed 10
3505120	3510320	the fear is always that there's someone in the crowd who is uh was uh you know what i mean like
3510320	3516000	i just had put it behind me and uh you know what i have no idea what you're talking about is someone
3516000	3520880	who started experimenting with stand-up at 17 right after jeffrey dimer ate everyone in milwaukee
3522080	3527680	and and when when all of the families of his 17 victims were going out to comedy clubs to try to
3527680	3533680	get away from uh their sorrows and every comic was like well it seems like everyone else in the
3533680	3538480	nation thinks this is funny right yeah never mind that i live in milwaukee and you i mean i'm sure
3538480	3544080	you were doing gigs in the days and weeks after 9 11 because i went to a show about a week after
3544080	3551440	a week and a half after all the shit went down and uh warren thomas did a set and did the funniest 9
3551440	3556320	11 joke of all time but but the audience before that nobody was really quite willing to laugh at
3556320	3561600	anything at all because the whole country the whole world was just like like in a in like a
3561600	3566560	weird suspension of like nothing's going to be funny for a while and and rightfully so like it's
3566560	3573440	a very it's very natural and uh some guy came on before him and told a bunch of jokes about how his
3573440	3578800	failing acting career and he's he's in a bunch of shows that were terrible and and about uh like
3578800	3582000	he's talking about his career and then warren thomas who was a great comic who died well how
3582000	3587920	many years ago about 10 years ago maybe he's a beloved hilarious guy and uh he goes he comes up
3587920	3591760	when his first joke was that yeah man i saw your demo reel i haven't seen that many bad pilots since
3591760	3599520	9 11 oh that is sweet and the crowd did not groan the crowd fucking went into like ecstasy
3599520	3604720	because we needed to fucking say something funny not not like not at the expense of what happened
3604720	3609600	it's just the world needed to somebody to fucking do the comedian's job is like let's all just
3609600	3614560	fucking let's all be in this room together and let's all laugh about anything at all yeah i think
3615280	3619200	it's a very courageous thing and there's a great you you never heard the the story about gilbert
3619200	3624320	godfrey that i i i did not want to see it's a whole long thing but i had no desire to see the
3624320	3629840	aristocrats it's like in some ways i'm like an old school guy like i had a fear my parents are
3629840	3634320	going to watch it and they're going to be watching you know something i go up the ass into the colon
3635280	3638240	i just couldn't understand but the but the premise that he had
3638960	3643120	tell them what he said well no i'm going back to a thing after the jones town massacre
3643120	3647600	oh because he said after 9 11 that he was late for gigs because he had to change planes at the
3647600	3655120	empire state building and then then he went into that ever anyway the crowd groaned and then he
3655120	3661840	said i'm just gonna i'm gonna horrify you with with viscera but what's the joke and i hope i'm
3661840	3665600	not getting this wrong because this is the story that i'm sure i'm being like like gonna get the
3665600	3671680	details wrong but i believe it was gilbert godfried at the film war in san francisco and
3671760	3675440	from what i've heard it's one of the greatest openers of all time and he comes out and it was
3675440	3678880	like a couple days or so after believe me if i'm getting this wrong somebody like
3679840	3684160	like put online the actual story of this but this is passed down to me through other comics
3684800	3688640	the jones town massacre horrible thing another one of those moments where nobody we're against it
3688640	3693360	yeah nobody knew what to think and certainly like we're going to a comedy show and all these
3693360	3698000	people have been massacred and it's a weird it's a weird time to go laugh about anything at all
3698000	3702080	especially he did the show in jones town right that was the thing i thought that was important
3702080	3710160	tough room you know i smell flesh i don't know how they even die when they drink the
3710160	3716400	what were they drinking the kool-aid so supposedly he comes out and i don't know
3716400	3720160	if he was doing the gilbert voice then or not but this is a long time ago i think he always
3720160	3726400	kind of do you always say i don't know i can't believe we all missed the to drink minimum bit
3726400	3736720	there a to drink to drink maximum no jones town tough room to poison to drink maximum
3737840	3740720	i'm really killing the night so uh
3743680	3747680	so he comes out and he says supposedly uh and forgive me if i'm getting any of this wrong but
3747680	3751680	the way i know the story is that uh he comes out and he says well the film auditorium san francisco
3751680	3758400	i grew up in san francisco which i don't think he did uh again it could be all wrong uh but the
3758400	3764000	point is he did did this joke i said uh like janice joplin played here and i i came here as a young
3764000	3768960	like a young teenager i saw janice joplin play here and i actually became friends with her
3768960	3775760	and i met her and we hung out and i was actually with janice when she died and i uh i held her in
3775760	3782000	my arms as janice died so to be here at the film it's very powerful it's a very emotional thing for
3782000	3786640	me i i saw jimmy hendrix player uh i became friends with jimmy hendrix i was with jimmy
3786640	3792880	hendrix the night that jimmy hendrix died i held i held jimmy hendrix in my arms as he died
3794000	3797120	um i just got back from jones town boy are my arms tired
3797120	3802480	ah
3803600	3808400	yeah fuck those people that jones down oh i'm sorry i'm sorry can i go too far
3808400	3813120	they knew what they signed up for they know yes but like eric i i'll pull up the quotes on my
3813120	3817840	eric did you ever see that thing eric idles wrote about what uh about how comics are licensed
3817840	3823440	gestures and that there should they should always have the freedom and it should be sanctioned by
3824080	3828960	by everybody that they have the ability to be seditious and to be uh well the trouble
3828960	3835280	is in the in the in the world where gestures come from you were vetted so with capitalism
3835280	3840240	everyone's a comic it's like open mic night and then some guy gets up we've all seen some horrible
3840240	3844720	shit i did stand up for all of uh a couple years before i gave up because i was bad and didn't have
3844720	3850480	the discipline to do it um and uh but you know i was i was i was at the safe house in milwaukee
3850480	3857600	with this this guy like he was a juggler and he was juggling uh like machetes and like they were
3857600	3864480	i guess they weren't sharp machetes but they were fucking metal and um and one of them just flew out
3864480	3871280	into the audience and like like like almost hit a lady and like he and she like she he didn't
3871280	3877920	apologize which i think you should always do when you almost machete someone um and and and and she's
3878000	3885840	like whoa and she was being relative to almost being machete a good sport and she was like uh
3885840	3891520	and i guess the machete kind of like went sort of like in the area of like where it landed i guess
3891520	3898320	it you know he saw the opportunity in that it like landed kind of between her legs and so he
3898320	3902240	made the joke as he picked it up he's like too bad it didn't go six inches further to keep you from
3902240	3909040	reproducing and then kept juggling now that's funny folks come on so like i just like when i
3909040	3914560	when i think about whether or not uh you know we should all be knighted you know for speaking
3914560	3919040	our mind like we're the defenders of of all this stuff i was like i always remember that guy i was
3919040	3923680	like that guy doesn't know what he's doing he's very nervous he's just throwing knives around
3923680	3928240	right he's and when he when he fucks up throwing knives around which is already bad enough
3928240	3935040	he he his mind leaps to his female circumcision or whatever he's like thinking i wish that
3935040	3941760	i'd cracked your vagina in half thank god remove you from the gene pool tough room anyways so
3944240	3949440	that's not me it's the machete guy so yeah we don't we we need to we we don't get that
3949440	3954640	gesture status however comedy in general when you're talking about comedy as a river you know
3954640	3959920	what should the ph level of that river be i think it should be primarily toxic i think there
3959920	3964960	should be i think there should be a causticity to things that get dipped in that river but people
3964960	3970240	but unless people like someone like brian regan who i think is hilarious that's his mind doesn't
3970240	3976800	work that what his mind doesn't work that way so i wouldn't call that caustic no no no you don't
3976800	3981280	have to be oh my god please yeah i'm sorry you don't have to be caustic as a comedian that's my
3981280	3985440	whole point i think of that kid like throwing knives and i go like he should not be protected
3985440	3991120	exactly by the law comedian rule i also like the on the other side of the spectrum a huge thing
3991120	3995200	that is violated is that everybody by default thinks you have to be mean to be funny and there
3995200	4000320	are so many wonderful warm sincere people who are truly funny because of their love of everyone
4000320	4009280	around them and they you got you got bill cosby oh that is inappropriate that inappropriate no
4009280	4015440	there's things to be joked all out and there's things that should be kept in a small box locked
4015440	4024880	away shame on you but yes yes you're right i was what i what i said i mean i think there's an
4024880	4031840	obligation of of comedy that it needs to be i i guess i guess let me just skip to my bottom line
4031840	4036640	and my agenda is i just don't think you should be you should be that popular i don't think you
4036720	4041120	should be that buddy buddy with the city hall and the and the guess who's coming in tonight
4041120	4045280	it's the president of the school yeah i'm on the student council and it's like okay you're
4045280	4049040	probably not doing comedy then there's a really good chance of that well found a perfect example
4049040	4054080	because and and lenno was a perfect example like you can't uh yes it worked for johnny carston
4054080	4059040	when he was the only show in the air he felt like he didn't want to go too far in either direction
4059040	4063280	you know politically that's fine he was johnny carston he was hilarious but for jay lenno to
4063280	4067040	say that he said to comedians you shouldn't have a point of view because you're an alien half the
4067040	4072400	crowd it's just ridiculous yeah you know and so it's like we know before we were talking about uh
4072400	4078800	the charlie hebdo and everybody upset that's why there's people like jimmy fallon right now because
4078800	4083120	the uncomfortable things are hard to talk to and so the people just want to want to clown who does
4083120	4090480	a potato sack race the irony is because comedy actually comedy has become such it has become
4090480	4094800	the only powerful tool left because politics have gone into the shitter everyone's lying when
4094800	4098400	they're breathing everyone is so jaded and everything the people that make you laugh
4098400	4103280	the people are getting their news from the daily show for 20 for 15 years and and and i don't even
4103280	4107360	say that like our country's starting to shitter it's like yeah i got my new john stewart became
4107360	4111520	walter kronkite he was the only one and and it was like because comedy was the only thing that
4111520	4118080	could be trusted that's weird don't pretend you know who walter kronkite was jesus christmas
4118720	4126080	but ironically with that comes oh my god uh that person said something that right that is not on
4126080	4130960	on logan's run point you know it's like like like whether or not soylint green is this or
4130960	4138320	whether it's people i know i'm mixing movies and metaphors the the the it that's the irony of
4138320	4144560	comedy's like emergence from all this other shit as like a trusted platform it's like we actually
4144640	4149280	need the people that make us laugh so bad now that will like hashtag cancel colbert
4149280	4154480	because the guy that runs his twitter feed accidentally non-contextually yeah ruined one
4154480	4158960	of his jokes and yeah and people were so upset about but you know i'll give you an example of
4158960	4163280	the where with the amcorolla thing it's like amcorolla if you listen to some of his bits where he
4163280	4169280	says mexicans have no culture they're coming up here to get our culture uh uh cab drivers why do
4169280	4173280	you think cab drivers don't pick up black people maybe they know something about black people that
4173280	4179760	you don't know those are not jokes so i'm even willing to accept that amcorolla was i never was
4179760	4184320	a huge fan but when he was on love line whatever he could be funny but that doesn't he maybe he
4184320	4190320	could be funny but now when he's just spewing racism he can't hide behind the fact that it's
4190320	4195280	a comic to justify what he's saying right and so it's good that we're moving into this age where
4195280	4201280	we can like detect that shit and call it out but it's like well it's a yeah i mean what ruins people's
4201520	4206160	life well he said not if not when it ruins people's lives like whose lives well i i don't
4206160	4210720	want to corolla i don't want to know he's not worried about amcorolla's life no i'm assuming
4210720	4216400	that that kid's worried about like for instance like and i don't know no one's defending this
4216400	4221360	lady but the african age joke lady oh yeah those things are those things i think those things are
4221360	4225680	sad when someone says something she's not even a comedian right so yeah i have 200 followers she's
4225680	4229440	getting a bad sense of humor like i don't even know if she was being ironic with that joke like
4230080	4234000	i might have made that joke on a bad day i don't know like out of white guilt you know like oh i'm
4234000	4239360	going to africa don't worry about me because i'm white like like parentheses i feel bad that i live
4239360	4244000	in a world where an entire continent is is is is our sewer and we don't give it any uh
4244880	4248800	federal aid and we're like like you know like maybe that's what she meant i don't know
4248800	4252320	yeah but it's the schadenfreude thing oh two people like people gang up on people
4253760	4257360	we're like a baby like finding out why'd you say that why'd you say that well i think it was just
4257360	4261920	more the thrill of and it's thrilling for everybody it's just sort of like you find out
4261920	4267040	that this arm you have can like grab things and so babies like just reach out for your face like
4267040	4272160	if a baby could suddenly muster the strength of a human being like like like like a lot of people
4272160	4276080	would lose their noses i think that's probably where that joke comes from like babies believe
4276080	4281920	it's possible to get your nose and they don't mind trying like but their muscles are putty
4281920	4286400	so they're they're just like you know baby just reaches out grabs your nose as hard as it fucking
4286480	4290720	can and yanks it's like i wonder if i could pull this fucking thing off his face i don't think the
4290720	4295360	baby i just don't think that ever is the babies that's the internet dialogue what's up with this
4295360	4299520	guy's face so like everybody so that that lady made that age joke walking around that big nose
4299520	4304160	on his face somebody kind of for fun like i saw a really funny joke once when it was like uh
4304160	4308960	i think this happened on twitter like when uh there was some astronaut going into space or
4308960	4315120	something and uh he was like this is some retired astronaut that was going up into space again for
4315120	4320720	like uh right some kind of nostalgic space run and uh he was like an astronaut in the 70s and
4320720	4325440	then he was now he was going back up again for some pr reason or something or maybe maybe maybe
4325440	4329680	he was needed up there i don't know he forgot his keys he left his golf ball he's like where's my
4329680	4335520	title list um the uh and then somebody i think i think it was a tweet there was a twitter was
4335520	4340800	first starting like somebody tweeted uh quick while he's in space everybody put an ape mask on
4345360	4350160	that that is the exact same principle that happened with that this woman she made this
4350160	4354560	shitty joke and she got on an airplane for africa and basically somebody made the joke of like hey
4354560	4360560	while she's in the air let's make her famous let's make her shitty joke that didn't land famous
4360560	4365920	and she got off the plane in africa and was like wow you're bigger than tom cruz good good job on
4365920	4372480	that age joke you fucking dingbat um and it's kind i mean i i i think that everybody every step of
4372480	4378320	the way in that process probably has at least 90 percent of the best intentions but the collective
4378320	4382640	emergence why about those people the hurt those did you hear about those guys they were like 70
4382640	4388000	year old guys and they're driving a hearse and they uh and had a veteran in there and i guess
4388000	4392880	the guy ran in to get a he was they had to drive for seven hours so they ran and got a donut and
4392880	4396800	then this guy came out and you're never supposed to leave a hearse and these guys were in the 70s
4396880	4402960	they got fired they got fired because uh yes they were probably wrong but is in other words like
4404000	4408880	why aren't you supposed to leave a hearse because you're supposed to because if it's a veteran uh
4408880	4413280	you and even in general with the hearses you if you're never supposed to general with the
4413280	4418080	hearse supposed to stop and you're supposed to stop at a buffet and then get back in
4418080	4424160	but uh and if you do i guess it seems tacky but if you do you're supposed to pull around and pull
4424160	4429200	these guys are in their 70s the guy's online he's saying i have no money i want to starve now
4429200	4434560	what why was it that important for the other guy to expose this person that's the that it really is
4434560	4439440	twitter and social networking it's like when the whole Woody Allen thing was happening people hated
4439440	4445200	me because i was saying you're basing you read a vanity fair article i mean thank god that the
4445200	4449840	court of public opinion is not an actual court you literally have never heard anything about
4449840	4455520	this case but you're basing your opinion on that i would just well people get yeah i mean we we get
4455520	4460400	very excited like those those the people when there's like a little kid that's murdered and
4460400	4464320	then there's there's there's all of us who are like man little kids shouldn't be murdered i am
4464320	4471200	against child's getting murdered um he's stipulating that before he does uh something uh another and
4471200	4475520	then and then there's the people who drive from out of state and like stand on the edge of the
4475520	4480560	lawn with like pictures of dead babies and hold them up and go like you're a I know you're a
4480560	4488320	murderer get out of there like that that person is doing put that anywhere 1983 that person's doing
4488320	4494800	that because it's hard to feel like a hero it's like that's not running on tap in your house
4494800	4499600	feeling like a hero and so when you when you read in the papers that like you know something
4499600	4507200	that's real easy to get behind happened or get behind against uh you you we we react
4507920	4513120	it's it's a sign of the fact that we're being deprived a healthy amount of mythology and
4513120	4517280	self-satisfaction in our day-to-day lives like we're not we're not going to bed at night feeling
4517280	4522400	like we're good people so like somebody something happens on the news that's like this kid got
4522400	4527120	abducted and murdered and it's like some people are like that is so fucked up that's so fucked up
4528000	4534240	so like no one else knows that's fucked up cool down steve no no it's fucking you don't understand
4534240	4537840	is this it's a fucking kid he's crying it's like what happened to steve
4539280	4543360	steve well i'll tell you steve steve's been working for eight years at the
4543360	4548080	horizon and he's like he's he's itching for a fucking sword to pull out of a stone
4548640	4553120	and that should be every that should be a human right to feel like you're a good guy well i'll
4553120	4557040	give you a perfect example i hate this guy i never liked this guy jake tapper i'm obsessed with
4557040	4562720	these horrible pundits so jake tapper the democrats uh well they're that's the democrat
4562720	4565200	party so i don't want to get into that thing where they call him democrat but it's called
4565200	4570160	the democrats is their website uh their their twitter thing so they said they put out a thing
4570160	4576000	happy uh memorial day and then it's uh obama holding an ice cream ice cream cone or whatever
4576000	4581360	and so uh jake tapper goes respectfully i don't believe that that was an appropriate image uh for

4925440	4932240	i'd like to be sponsored by do you are you are you satisfied uh uh with my provider well
4932400	4936000	uh what's your upload speeds
4937440	4942400	like you're so outspoken and so funny and so an honest ground and you say what you feel
4942400	4949200	and are unmistakably one of the like a comic's comic and an audience's comic and so incredibly
4949200	4955760	funny and where is your sitcom like let's run 13 episodes and then gotten cancelled like where is
4955760	4961440	your crown and glory are you are you where are you at with your relationship with your career
4961440	4966560	because it's like like you're you're like the you're like the king of this mountain that's like
4966560	4973920	you i don't know how much higher you can get on it but like everyone respects you and like you're
4973920	4978320	you're not seinfeld like and and and so how do you what is your relationship with that stuff well i
4978320	4982080	think everybody know anybody would say like i mean anything that could happen wherever you know
4982080	4986560	someone said here's your sitcom i wouldn't turn it down i mean it's not like we all i mean like i
4986560	4991360	in my mind i'd like to be a since i was 12 i'd like to be a movie actor you know you know how
4991520	4993040	louis does those faces where he's like
4996000	5001440	it's a kind of thing i did when i was 12 but the point is is that uh i'd like i always like more i
5001440	5007200	always like more but the truth is and this is the god's honest truth is that i have never been had
5007200	5012320	the thing i love most is stand up and this is me every night i love it but and the fact that i can
5012320	5017040	pay my bills and i you know i'm recurring thing here or doing a little thing there so i'm completely
5017600	5023520	happy the only thing that bothers me is when i get towards being broken right and otherwise
5023520	5027520	i used to also i don't want to fictionalize personally don't want to fictionalize anything
5027520	5032480	anymore so i don't want to be a stereo store sale well that doesn't even exist i don't want to be uh
5034160	5038240	yeah i don't want to be an exercise dude of the funny the guy at the exercise studio who puts
5038240	5043040	down the other exercise right you know well yeah i thought because we said because we're we're
5043040	5046640	we're friends with drew carrie who like we watched go through well we didn't watch him go through it
5046640	5050720	we met him when he was already going through it like this is a dangerous game you're playing
5050720	5055680	there when you if you the highest achievement is you get a sitcom and you're like my name's
5056240	5063360	my actual name but i but i work in an ad firm but and like but it's really me and so like your
5063360	5070400	identity i remember drew had expressed this at one point it's like then you get canceled and it's you
5070400	5074880	but it's not you it never was you it drew like when when when everybody was watching the drew
5074880	5079280	carrie show that meant the world loved drew carrie they call it i love drew carrie i love it like
5079280	5083360	they're talking about the show but i was like it's also his first and last name and then when
5083360	5087760	people stop watching drew carrie and stop liking drew carrie like that's a that's that's tough
5087760	5093120	emotional grounds i also think that i honestly the truth is and this is the truth to me is that you
5093120	5100080	really can't control that's why like oprah when they would do these actual ancient you know
5100160	5104400	eastern ideas but they would misappropriate them like you create your own reality
5104960	5108320	but that doesn't work if you're jewish and it means you want to go in the concentration camp
5108320	5112240	you know what i mean it's like people can it's like people know what i'm saying i'm just saying
5112240	5116560	the jews did not want to go into a concentration right so if you just think you create your own
5116560	5121680	reality that's a misunderstanding but you do put your own energy in the world and you and you and
5121680	5127520	you can control what you do sometimes but you can't always control what the end result is so i'm
5127760	5131760	comfortable that i just don't know what's going to happen and that wouldn't discount anything
5131760	5137920	right you know i wouldn't do a show called the drew carrie show you know that's off the table
5138880	5142800	even even even though i mean you don't respect copyright law but that's not the reason i wish
5142800	5147040	we'd do it on a craftsmanship yes it's like it's been done and you don't want to do it i'm
5147040	5151840	yeah i'm a stickler i'm a stickler i'm not they pitched me Seinfeld that's what that's your show
5151840	5157360	that's your show the stickler the stickler i'm the stickler andy stickler the andy stickler
5157360	5161840	show but andy kindler is the stickler hey you're not getting that right
5165120	5170320	yeah that's how that's you in the in the round window underneath andy kindler is the stickler
5170320	5174240	then you pop up hey you're not getting that right it's a posture it's a posture for yes
5174400	5182720	yes yeah he comes in and yeah right in the words of edwin newman anyone uh but i would
5182720	5186000	but i would like sometimes i think i'd like to do a talk show i did a thing called kindler
5186000	5191440	television which i should probably put online because no one bought it but uh and so i have
5191440	5196560	ideas but i'm gonna ask a question that's that's did we cut you off or what's what uh he's quiet
5197200	5202320	well we were gonna we're gonna play a game with him in a second and you're you're captive of it
5202320	5207520	um but do you do you have a podcast it's like saying do you what's your sign in the 70s

5314880	5319440	have any respect for that doesn't respect you and that's like and in the world of comedians where
5319440	5324240	people can be competitive and and and dark and have their own shits like that is like yeah name

5333600	5338480	cafe that was i absolutely do is across the street from uh patro's grill right right there
5338480	5342320	just up the road on vermont it's gone by the way thanks for saying that man it means so much
5342960	5347040	there was a tiny little coffee house and i don't think i talked about this was we we completely
5347040	5352000	just filleted you on a show a while back we talked about how much we loved you for a half hour but uh
5352000	5356880	there was this tiny little coffee house and there was never more than 20 people in there
5356880	5361840	and it was run by josh de donato oh my god and this is a guy that started putting an actual
5361840	5366400	fucking egg timer on the stage and he would set it like so if you did if you went over your two
5366400	5372720	minutes i remember jeremy kramer kicking it like a football and it went like a 50 yards
5373920	5379520	it was great but uh you came out and i don't believe you did anything that resembled material
5379520	5384160	at all you just riffed a guy in the front row the entire goddamn time there was a guy that had an
5384160	5388960	outfit on and it thought the joke was it was not a preposterous outfit you just you just gave this
5388960	5393600	guy the business about his shirts and it was a perfectly acceptable shirt but you just gave him
5393840	5400720	perfectly acceptable shirt and you you just stormed the stage is like a like a really like
5400720	5404960	like smaller than the meltdown stage like probably by half there's a little tiny piece of like like
5404960	5410400	like wood on wooden blocks and you just stormed around at like general patent and we were just
5410960	5416960	fucking apoplectic laughing and also uh whether it was that night or another night there was uh
5416960	5420800	these two guys came in we heard guitars playing up the street and they came down the road and came
5420800	5425120	in and it was jack black and cow gas and no one uh had i remember this night i remember and i
5425120	5428640	asked jack about it and i said uh i said i saw you play at the honest gay friend he goes that was
5428640	5434000	our first show are you serious do you remember how funny that bit they were doing was yeah they
5434000	5438720	they came in again wow like you came in there and you absolutely just dominated and then i don't
5438720	5442720	know who was on first you were them but they came in they stood back to back and strumming the fuck
5442720	5449920	out of these acoustic guitars and circled around and they sang um uh what's the song uh uh
5450880	5454400	this is not the best song in the world tribute they fucking sang tribute and that was that
5454400	5458960	it was their first fucking show and and and sarah silverman i think paul tomkins was that
5458960	5463280	was maybe one of his first shows in l.a and he had a shitty rumpled ass bill fitting suit
5463920	5469280	and now he's like sartorial fucking mastery uh but that that was a magical great i mean that
5469280	5474880	was unbelievable there was all the the quote unquote independent indie comics that came down
5474880	5480720	from the bay area were you bay area no i'm from it's a long was not that long story i'm from queen
5480880	5489840	and i moved here right uh don't get me started no i started here i came out to be a musician
5489840	5494800	i came out to be a musician i started coming here just because i i would have had to have left
5494800	5498480	to start in a smaller town but i knew all those guys because i used to play laughs unlimited
5498480	5502480	in sacrament it was it was so it was an amazing time i remember that moment of like being there
5503200	5508320	fred belford our friend took me there and we sat there and i'm not a stand-up comic but everybody
5508400	5511920	there was either up and comers or there were people that like oh you have to see this guy
5511920	5517840	this person's from or this gal like this is jenning raffle this is uh margaret shell there's like
5517840	5522560	of these people that they've heard of um everything in there was so fucking magical and the host was
5522560	5527440	kind of a looney tins yeah he really was crazy but there was you and jeremy craymer and uh
5527440	5533280	and it was uh harlem williams and fucking it was so godbob bob bob odenkirk stand-up yeah yeah
5533280	5537600	it's amazing stand-up that was a magical time and then i told them a little bit you did a show
5537600	5543040	called hacks hacks hacks you gave me a smile like hello like you and i go bob odenkirk's full of shit
5544880	5549760	anyway anyway there was that that magical moment when you go like oh like i'm allowed to like
5549760	5553920	stand-up again because stand-up had this giant explosion in the 80s where everybody that thought
5553920	5558480	they were uh mildly entertainment entertaining stood in front of a brick wall and bummed you
5558480	5563360	the fuck out but you can't knock that generation because i mean like it became very like it was
5563360	5567920	very strange it was like judy tenuta and and our friend bob cochlethwaite and like like like there
5567920	5573120	was a the character comedy started to happen it was like you really there was this huge pressure
5573120	5577840	on comedians to like come out and like it was like star search you know like you've got a fucking
5577840	5583040	like below like what's your deal are you the guy with the penis for a head are you the guy with
5583040	5588480	dice on his neck or you know like like is your name jock van schlocken dock and you know and
5588480	5592800	then the and then the 90s it was like this it was the grunge thing it was the you know it was
5592800	5599920	like the and and but but you transcend all of that because uh you you you don't wear flannel and
5599920	5606320	never have i had i did i did have i had i wore acid wash jackets in the late 80s it's the most
5606320	5610400	depressing thing but i will say one thing right now i think right now is an amazing time period
5610400	5615760	for comedy right now i really do great there's because people are actually going out you get
5615920	5621120	these guys are fans of right now but like yeah i love right now adomian hannibal burris there's
5621120	5626320	so many amazing it's pretty cool who are you naming what's uh james adomian oh yeah he was
5626320	5631840	just he was on last week so he came on and did a uh bernie sanders impression for three hours it
5631840	5637280	was great yeah it's amazing uh you know hannibal burris i mean there's just so many names and uh
5637840	5644800	and um people like todd glass it was so it was always hilarious and it's just amazing i don't
5644800	5651520	know it's just like uh let's not forget jeff dunham he's great like he's not racist following
5651520	5658000	their heart it's racist carlos mancia is really hitting a stride right now yes uh is demorge
5658000	5662960	demorge brown out there demorge you with us i don't think i usually see him lingering yeah no
5662960	5667520	demorge tonight should we just do a very if demorge is listening usually i see you lingering
5667520	5671360	what why don't i think i don't know if that's a note dan uh spencer let uh let me know what you
5671360	5676480	think we're running a little bit late here uh yeah we always start late too why don't we yeah
5676480	5681760	but let's uh let's maybe just play a very small lean and mean uh shadow around with just the three
5681760	5685600	of us maybe do you want to bring somebody else up to play another character um we does that muddy
