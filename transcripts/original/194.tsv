0	21480	In Hollywood, California, again here's some music by Geordie White, pretty groovy.
21480	24480	Harman Town is now in session.
30480	33480	Spencer Crichton, everybody. Spencer.
41480	45480	And your mayor, Dan Harman.
51480	54480	Thank you very much. Thank you.
56480	58480	Thank you.
58480	62480	Well, we've had a string of some pretty action-packed episodes, but a lot of crazy guests and...
62480	65480	We've had too much show for too many shows.
65480	68480	Yeah. So let's slow it down tonight.
68480	78480	Tonight, let's just relax and have a bad show, because we're all tired and there's nobody coming.
78480	83480	And I don't have anything to talk about, because I came here directly from the Great Mindset, as did you, Spencer.
83480	86480	Yes, we did.
88480	99480	Today, we shot with Gillian Jacobs from Community. She played Ada Lovelace, the mother of programming. Ada Lovelace. Or is it Loveless?
99480	101480	Ada Loveless.
101480	103480	No, Ada Lovelace.
103480	105480	Do the British pronounce Lovelace Loveless?
105480	109480	I think they pronounce a lot of things, a lot of ways.
109480	112480	All I know is she's the mother of modern computing.
112480	114480	She wrote the first algorithm.
114480	116480	She wrote the very first lines of code.
116480	121480	Yeah, the first algorithm. There were no computers yet. She wrote an algorithm.
121480	123480	You go, girl.
125480	127480	That's all I got.
128480	136480	I still, you know, some classic observations. I still wish they made a pill that could make your fingernails stop growing.
136480	142480	I'm just never going to clip these things, like, on schedule. What else is going on?
142480	145480	Boy, that vice president's up those old tricks.
147480	149480	Yes, Jeff?
149480	151480	Do you have really long fingernails right now?
151480	153480	You know, they're dirty, gross claws.
153480	154480	You should bite them.
154480	157480	I don't want to get a bite. I don't bite them.
157480	160480	No. Well, I've never been tempted to do that.
160480	161480	Do it.
161480	162480	No.
163480	164480	Do it right now.
164480	165480	No.
165480	166480	Do it in front of this office.
166480	167480	Bite them.
167480	170480	This is exactly how the Donner Party started.
171480	173480	It was cold and they were locked in a cabin.
173480	175480	Someone's like, God, I'm sorry.
175480	177480	You should bite your nails, Gloria.
177480	180480	Bite them. Bite them. Now keep biting.
180480	181480	Now let us help.
182480	189480	I'm Gloria Donner, the first person eaten at the Donner Party.
192480	196480	You guys saw that Hannibal prequel where they, uh, yeah.
196480	197480	All right.
198480	202480	Where they, like, walk you through how, yeah, I've talked about that.
202480	210480	The Donner Party thing reminded me of that, because essentially part of Hannibal's, Hannibal Lecter's origin is that he's like a little kid under the table at an ersatz,
210480	214480	Donner Party, that he's like under a table watching.
214480	218480	That's his first experience in life is that sometimes people eat people.
218480	225480	Like they walk you through bit by bit, piece by piece, like how you could become Hannibal Lecter from being you.
225480	228480	They remove all the fun out of the character.
228480	229480	It's just like, hey, could happen to you.
229480	231480	You could be Hannibal Lecter.
233480	235480	He's not Peter Parker.
235480	239480	We weren't going to that for that.
239480	241480	He was bitten by a radioactive hungry person.
243480	247480	I could give you some iPad app recommendations.
248480	250480	They're not funny ones, though.
250480	253480	I don't want to start any more beefs with any more Franco's.
256480	260480	I'm playing a game called Knights of Pen and Paper 2.
260480	261480	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
261480	266480	Sequel to a great, if you like role-playing games and like turn-based combat.
266480	267480	It's that.
268480	269480	It's that.
269480	270480	And it's a great sequel.
270480	271480	What classes are you running, Dan?
271480	272480	For the people at home.
278480	283480	I have a lab rat wizard boy.
283480	288480	I have a goth, a goth girl, like.
289480	290480	That's not a class.
294480	295480	Sortie herder.
296480	297480	She's got a big sword.
297480	298480	I think she's a.
299480	301480	Especially you play the game, too.
302480	303480	I played it.
303480	304480	Yeah, yeah.
304480	306480	What do you what do you play?
307480	310480	What do you have a camera over there?
314480	315480	Shrobs doing a thing.
318480	321480	Is there any camera that can see that?
326480	328480	Jeff just closed the door on Shrobs.
331480	334480	Sorry, got to fill you in on a backstory.
334480	336480	The show has a phantom zone and.
338480	343480	Our general Zod's are sentenced there when they try to usurp the son of Krypton.
345480	346480	Now he's sulking.
346480	347480	He's sulking.
347480	348480	All right.
348480	348480	
348480	349480	Let's bring him out.
349480	350480	Rob Shrobs here again.
350480	355480	God damn it.
355480	356480	Damn it.
379480	380480	Hey, Rob.
380480	381480	Hello.
383480	384480	How are you doing, man?
384480	385480	I'm doing all right, Jeffrey.
385480	386480	How are you?
386480	387480	I'm fair to Midland.
388480	389480	What's.
390480	392480	Take us to your day, Rob.
393480	395480	What'd you have for breakfast?
398480	399480	What did I have for breakfast?
400480	401480	I had.
403480	404480	Are you a breakfast guy?
405480	406480	Not really.
406480	407480	No, I have.
407480	411480	How come every time someone dies, you text me that you love me?
414480	415480	What?
417480	419480	What does that mean?
421480	423480	Am I supposed to say I love you, too?
423480	424480	Was it Prince?
424480	426480	Well, I don't want to say it's personal, actually.
426480	427480	We lost a friend.
428480	431480	I'm giving you a through line for your biopic.
433480	434480	It's just a runner.
434480	435480	Is that.
435480	436480	Yeah, yeah.
436480	437480	But is it.
437480	438480	Am I supposed to.
438480	439480	Is it after I die or people go.
439480	440480	He should.
440480	441480	He should have.
441480	442480	He should have loved Shrobs back.
442480	443480	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
443480	444480	No, no, no.
444480	446480	Was it Patton's wife or who?
446480	447480	Well, Jesus.
450480	451480	Yes, there was a death.
451480	454480	There was a death close to the close to close to the decks.
454480	457480	And every time, though, I'm saying it doesn't matter.
457480	458480	It's a famous person.
458480	459480	It's a friend.
459480	461480	It's like every time I love you, you should take better care.
461480	463480	Well, you don't think you should take better care of yourself.
463480	464480	I did.
464480	465480	I did once.
465480	466480	But you're like, I'm really concerned.
467480	468480	No, no.
468480	470480	I'm doing something wrong by living.
470480	471480	No, no, no, no, no.
471480	472480	It's not.
472480	473480	No, that is not.
473480	474480	That is not.
474480	475480	No.
475480	476480	What is it?
476480	477480	What is the what is going on there?
477480	479480	I want you to know I love you.
479480	480480	Those moments.
480480	481480	Those moments.
481480	482480	Robin Williams dies.
482480	484480	I love you, Dan.
484480	485480	Yeah.
485480	486480	David Bowie.
486480	488480	I love you, Dan.
488480	490480	Prince.
490480	491480	What?
491480	492480	What?
492480	494480	What do you what do you think I'm going to do?
494480	496480	I have a platinum record.
496480	498480	I wish you would write better records.
499480	505480	I just I just went in those moments when you lose something special.
505480	509480	You know, you just you start taking account of.
514480	515480	It is.
515480	517480	You shouldn't be insulted by it or offended or.
517480	524480	I feel like the audience just awed and then laughed at themselves.
525480	527480	And they were right.
527480	528480	Fair enough.
528480	531480	No, no, we got this bit going on that we don't like each other.
531480	533480	And I want you to know that it's not true.
533480	537480	Well, I was someone special dies for you, Rob.
537480	539480	You think of the people special close to you.
539480	540480	Yeah.
540480	545480	And you think of maybe the distance, the gulf between you and Dan.
545480	548480	There's a lot of there's a lot of you wish that you were closer together.
548480	549480	Yeah.
549480	555480	Which look at look at physically how I could not be further away.
555480	556480	You could scoot.
556480	558480	You could scoot two stools closer.
558480	559480	No.
561480	562480	Well, OK.
562480	563480	I can't do this.
563480	566480	Well, we don't have a show.
566480	574480	So why don't we do a little holodeck scene where you're not working on the Lego two movie for seven and a half years.
574480	578480	And I'm not working on nine hundred and fifty projects for nine hundred years.
578480	579480	Wow.
579480	580480	Biggest fan.
580480	586480	I'm getting the fuck out of this shit.
586480	590480	I've seen the hologram, Beck.
590480	591480	Fuck that.
591480	594480	Tomorrow morning's blog entry starts.
594480	597480	I have colitis.
597480	598480	It's hard.
598480	600480	I struggle with it all the time.
600480	603480	And my entire life, people have been asking, why are you going to the bathroom?
603480	605480	I have colitis.
606480	608480	I'm getting the fuck out.
611480	612480	All right.
612480	615480	So where where do we take us to the holodeck?
615480	616480	What do we fade in?
616480	622480	It probably takes a lot of fucking like like like if you sit in the front row and you have to get up.
622480	624480	It probably you're probably like holy shit.
624480	629480	You probably she's probably already been through the whole thing of like like it's just like God damn it.
629480	630480	I'm going to have to do it.
630480	634480	I'm going to have to get up and she's like an old timey reporter where she has to go to the phone booth.
635480	636480	Oh my God.
637480	638480	I got a hot story.
639480	640480	All right.
640480	640480	
640480	641480	Yeah.
641480	642480	No.
642480	644480	I was like please shrap every time every time someone dies.
644480	645480	I get a text.
645480	651480	Oh I'm just I'm trying to give you like kind of like you know like an Edward Runner you know Bela Lugosi calling up.
651480	653480	What are you setting up biopics for?
653480	655480	Just love me.
655480	656480	I'm trying dude.
656480	660480	But you're you put me on the spot making me feel bad.
660480	661480	Let's holodeck it.
661480	662480	Okay.
662480	663480	Let's holodeck it.
663480	664480	Okay.
664480	665480	Let's just pretend.
665480	667480	Let's holodeck it out.
667480	669480	Let's holodeck like we used to.
669480	670480	Let's holodeck it.
670480	671480	Let's holodeck.
671480	672480	Give me some water.
672480	673480	Throw me that one in the middle.
673480	674480	All right.
674480	675480	Thanks.
675480	676480	All right.
678480	679480	Okay.
679480	680480	There we go.
684480	686480	Don't make it that kind of show.
687480	688480	It's not.
688480	694480	It's supposed to be a thoughtful show.
694480	695480	All right.
695480	700480	Well I just came here because we rejected the concept that catching something is important.
702480	704480	It's about it's about connection Dan.
704480	706480	It's about it's about human.
706480	707480	Yeah exactly.
707480	708480	All right.
708480	711480	So if we're going to holodeck it where do you want to fade in into this holodeck.
711480	712480	She's back.
716480	717480	She's wiping her seat down.
717480	719480	She spilled cranberry juice.
719480	721480	She spilled cranberry juice Dan.
721480	723480	It's not that big of a deal.
723480	725480	She's wearing black.
725480	726480	Who cares?
726480	728480	She's spilling cranberry juice Dan.
728480	729480	I know.
729480	730480	We all know.
730480	731480	It's not that big of a deal.
731480	732480	I know.
732480	734480	That's code for period.
736480	737480	Oh shit.
737480	738480	Is that right?
738480	739480	Yes.
739480	741480	I've got my cranberry juice.
741480	742480	All right.
742480	744480	I have to go to the bathroom.
744480	747480	I haven't had a girlfriend in so long.
747480	750480	I don't know these code words.
750480	751480	All right.
751480	754480	So holodeck friendship with Shrab.
754480	757480	Where are we fading in to solve these problems?
757480	759480	Does this program to make me look bad?
759480	760480	No.
760480	761480	Well no.
761480	765480	It's programmed to call your bluff because when I get a text that says I love you only
765480	766480	when people die.
766480	772480	It's like to me the unspoken thing is like we don't see each other enough.
772480	774480	We don't have a close enough relationship.
774480	775480	You eat too much.
775480	776480	You drink too much.
776480	778480	But I've said that here out loud.
778480	780480	I've said those words.
780480	782480	I don't have to have.
782480	786480	I don't have to do some kind of sleight of hand with a text.
786480	788480	I say that to your face.
788480	789480	Yeah.
789480	791480	So why can't you just text Prince died?
791480	794480	I write R.I.P. Prince.
794480	795480	What do you want?
795480	798480	Then you say I love you Dan.
798480	799480	It's like so loaded.
799480	800480	Okay.
800480	801480	Well fine.
801480	802480	What do you.
802480	804480	Now I sound like a dick.
804480	805480	Gun to your head.
805480	806480	What do you want?
806480	807480	You want me to stop?
807480	808480	Oh.
808480	809480	Fuck you.
809480	810480	No.
810480	811480	Gun to your head.
811480	812480	You want me to keep doing it.
812480	813480	All right.
813480	814480	Look.
814480	815480	Gun to your head.
815480	816480	Virtual.
816480	817480	Virtual fishing boat.
817480	818480	The gun is gone.
818480	819480	Sss.
819480	820480	Ooooo.
820980	822840	Shhhh.
822840	824800	Sssssss.
824800	828120	Virtual fishing boat.
828120	829120	Shhhh.
829120	833560	Short clip of a cow calling.
833560	837380	T
837380	839040	Shhhh.
839040	840920	Whoooo.
840920	844640	Shut up!
844640	847080	Shut up you scared of fish!
847080	850020	Shut up!
851020	853020	Whoooooo.
857020	860020	Whoooooo.
860020	862020	Is that the soundtrack?
862020	865020	It's a whale.
865020	867020	It's foggy.
874020	877020	So it's good that we finally got this moment alone.
877020	878020	Yes, it sure is Dan.
878020	879020	To be best friends.
879020	880020	Yes.
880020	881020	Fishing together.
881020	882020	Yes, finally.
882020	885020	So that we can finally hang out and love each other.
885020	888020	We've retired and this is it.
888020	893020	Thank God none of us worked really hard until we dropped dead without warning.
893020	894020	Thank God.
894020	895020	Thank God we did that.
895020	897020	Now we can enjoy this sunshine.
897020	898020	Now here we are.
898020	899020	And this fish.
899020	900020	Yep.
901020	909020	Think of, think of, think of what we would've, I mean, woof.
911020	913020	I made you something.
915020	916020	Yeah?
916020	917020	Yeah.
917020	919020	Close your eyes.
922020	925020	Hold out your hand.
925020	927020	It's my shit.
928020	930020	The fuck?
930020	931020	What the fuck?
931020	932020	What the fuck?
932020	933020	Jet ski?
933020	934020	What the?
935020	936020	He's got a detachable.
936020	938020	You son of a bitch.
953020	954020	Fucking asshole.
954020	955020	Shit.
958020	961020	No, no, no, no.
961020	963020	Helicopter.
966020	968020	Say you don't love me anymore.
972020	974020	Stop telling me you love me.
974020	976020	I love you Dan.
988020	990020	Woohoo!
993020	994020	Hi, Roded.
1001020	1003020	I'm so sorry.
1008020	1013020	I'm just going to land so my angel wings don't have to flap so much.
1014020	1017020	Can we get back to fishing, please?
1024020	1028020	Dan killed you and you still want to hang out with him and fish through him?
1028020	1029020	I put shit in his hand.
1029020	1031020	It's kind of evened himself out.
1031020	1032020	He killed himself.
1032020	1033020	Yeah.
1033020	1034020	You're all, yeah.
1034020	1035020	I gave him an out.
1037020	1039020	All right, that didn't work.
1040020	1044020	All right, well, I hope you enjoyed this level of show.
1047020	1048020	Our next guest.
1048020	1050020	Do you not want to be loved by Rob?
1050020	1055020	You just don't want to be loved when people die and that's when you feel loved by him most.
1055020	1056020	It makes him uncomfortable.
1056020	1058020	It makes him uncomfortable to hear.
1058020	1062020	Are you loving him more when famous people die than other ones?
1062020	1064020	No, when anybody dies.
1064020	1066020	You know, when just death is happening.
1066020	1067020	I'm like that with Kate.
1067020	1068020	I'm like that with Lolly.
1068020	1070020	I'm like that with a lot of people.
1071020	1078020	And Dan, you feel you don't want to be loved only when mortality is the thing.
1078020	1079020	It makes him uncomfortable.
1079020	1080020	It makes him uncomfortable.
1080020	1081020	Well, he doesn't put it anywhere.
1081020	1083020	That's the same thing with my mom.
1083020	1087020	She'll like send me a direct tweet or something.
1087020	1090020	It'll say like, be nice to hear from you now and then.
1090020	1093020	Like, bitch, you got my number.
1094020	1095020	Text me.
1096020	1097020	I called her bluff.
1097020	1098020	I said, you can text me anytime.
1098020	1100020	Well, I wouldn't want to bother you.
1100020	1101020	Bother me.
1101020	1102020	She never does.
1103020	1104020	She doesn't text me.
1104020	1105020	But do you want her to?
1106020	1107020	I don't know.
1108020	1109020	I don't know.
1109020	1110020	I've texted you.
1110020	1111020	What up?
1111020	1112020	What up, man?
1112020	1113020	What's going on, man?
1114020	1115020	What do I do?
1116020	1117020	You don't write back.
1121020	1123020	You don't have to scratch your head.
1123020	1128020	You're in workaholic mode where like you're busy as a motherfucker all the time.
1128020	1129020	Yeah, you got no time.
1129020	1132020	You have the best excuse to not reply because you're always working.
1132020	1133020	You have the best out all the time.
1133020	1134020	I get it.
1134020	1136020	Also, sometimes they put his phone in a box.
1137020	1138020	Yeah.
1138020	1139020	Wait, say what?
1139020	1143020	Sometimes like a small man comes and puts his phone into a box.
1145020	1146020	All right.
1147020	1149020	His name is Steve Levy.
1150020	1153020	Rob, are you a fan of the horror film genre?
1153020	1155020	Yes, I am actually, yes.
1155020	1156020	Yeah.
1156020	1157020	Do you like cinema?
1157020	1158020	I like cinemas.
1158020	1159020	Yes, I like them.
1160020	1168020	Well, our next guest is, he played the, I think the most recent Jason Voorhees.
1168020	1169020	Yes, he did.
1169020	1174020	So I think he must have done a terrible job because they kind of like, they stopped making those movies.
1175020	1177020	I think he must have killed people wrong.
1179020	1180020	I think he killed him.
1181020	1182020	He killed everybody in the movie.
1182020	1184020	There's nobody, he was too good.
1184020	1185020	Oh, he's too good.
1186020	1188020	He hunted himself to extinction.
1189020	1192020	Every Jason Voorhees movie has to, all right, okay.
1192020	1197020	Well, he's an old friend of ours and I don't think he's ever been up on this podcast.
1197020	1198020	He's just hanging out.
1198020	1199020	Don't look at me.
1199020	1201020	You know the roster better than I do.
1201020	1203020	Please welcome Derek Mears.
1203020	1205020	Oh, yeah.
1210020	1216020	Oh, shit.
1226020	1227020	Derek.
1229020	1232020	I just spilled my cranberry juice.
1234020	1236020	Yeah, come on over on this side of the deck.
1236020	1238020	What are you going in the middle of, I can't.
1239020	1242020	195, episode 195.
1242020	1243020	Oh, yeah.
1243020	1244020	We're coming up on 200.
1244020	1245020	We should do something special.
1245020	1246020	Yeah.
1246020	1247020	For that episode.
1249020	1250020	195.
1250020	1252020	I wanted to do a gag tonight where I get so mad at Shrob.
1252020	1257020	I'm chasing him around like some crates and then he runs behind a crate and then you come out the other side.
1259020	1262020	And it just puts me off of chasing Shrobs forever.
1264020	1265020	Don't tell the audience.
1265020	1266020	It's going to be great.
1266020	1267020	Let's do it.
1267020	1268020	I hate Shrobs so much.
1270020	1272020	It's an old Looney Tunes joke.
1274020	1276020	Just smiling and politely.
1278020	1285020	For the crowd here that doesn't know our origin story, we know Derek, all of us, Dan, Rob and I threw comedy sports.
1285020	1287020	Derek, you were Bakersfield Comedy Sports.
1287020	1288020	Yeah.
1288020	1289020	Correct.
1289020	1291020	Rob and Dan were Milwaukee.
1291020	1292020	Milwaukee.
1292020	1294020	I was LA and we all met at certain tournaments.
1295020	1302020	And we all met like, remember sitting with Derek Mirrors, I'll talk to you in the first person.
1303020	1307020	Sit with Derek and we saw the Burt Ferschner's play in Milwaukee.
1308020	1315020	And you and I sat next to each other and it was like Mike Rock, Chris Tom and all of our New York friends.
1316020	1320020	And we saw something so funny that you and I looked at each other like, fuck this shit.
1320020	1324020	Like, we were actually unhappy at how funny things were.
1324020	1325020	Yeah, they were too good.
1325020	1328020	And Rob and Dan were in the Dead L Wives.
1328020	1331020	And like, again, we're like, these guys, they're funnier than we are.
1331020	1332020	So like, fuck it.
1332020	1334020	Like, go home, we're done. Totally done.
1334020	1336020	Oh, you were watching us? That's the...
1336020	1337020	Yeah, well...
1337020	1338020	Oh, yeah.
1339020	1342020	You saw something so funny that you were like, let's quit forever.
1342020	1345020	And those things were Dan Harmon.
1346020	1353020	Well, actually, I thought Sean McKenna was the funniest Dead L Wives.
1353020	1354020	It's true.
1354020	1356020	Yeah, because he was the most punk rock.
1356020	1359020	He was like, you guys were all funny. You guys were all hilarious.
1359020	1361020	But he was so dangerous and so weird.
1361020	1365020	I was like, I came from L.A. comedy sports, which was so safe.
1365020	1372020	And so by the numbers, I was like, oh, like these guys are actually like punk rockers in the improv world.
1372020	1378020	And we all ended up hanging out like on the sidelines and like becoming friends.
1378020	1384020	And my friendship with Rob, Dan, all you guys, coincided with Derek Mears.
1384020	1387020	You guys think Kanye West gets a bad rap?
1387020	1393020	Like, I feel like everybody...
1393020	1397020	He does a good rap, too.
1397020	1404020	He's never, as far as I know, he's never hit anybody or abused anybody.
1404020	1407020	And he's got seven number one albums in a row.
1407020	1412020	I mean, we keep waiting for him to become humble or normal.
1412020	1415020	I think he's just a lunatic, right?
1415020	1418020	But he's got seven number one albums in a row.
1418020	1420020	I think a lot of it's just a big show.
1420020	1424020	Just kind of like an Alice Cooper Marilyn Manson on the metal side, on the hip-hop side.
1424020	1429020	He does things just to get people in people's mindset and to be in the consciousness.
1429020	1430020	Yeah.
1430020	1432020	You know what he just did, though?
1432020	1433020	Well, he didn't just do it.
1433020	1434020	He did a while ago.
1434020	1437020	He was like, my album's always going to be on title.
1437020	1439020	Only title forever.
1439020	1440020	And then it wasn't.
1440020	1445020	So like a lot of people subscribe to title under false pretenses.
1445020	1448020	And now there's a class action lawsuit or something.
1448020	1449020	I don't know.
1449020	1450020	What?
1450020	1451020	What?
1451020	1457020	Well, the subscription program or thing service music streaming subscription by JZ.
1457020	1459020	I don't know nothing about that.
1459020	1460020	Yeah.
1460020	1462020	He's got all this talent, right?
1462020	1464020	He's trying to get talent on his side.
1464020	1467020	Kanye's like, it's only going to be on title.
1467020	1470020	If you want talent, it's going to be on title.
1470020	1471020	You best subscribe.
1471020	1475020	And then then it comes out not on title and everyone's like, well, what the fuck?
1475020	1476020	What are we doing this for?
1476020	1480020	We could just buy albums like normal people.
1480020	1483020	Well, still, though, a lot of people hit women.
1483020	1484020	Yeah, no, no.
1484020	1486020	And piss on people and stuff.
1486020	1487020	That's still not bad.
1487020	1489020	I got to say.
1489020	1492020	And I feel like if you're going to tear up someone's floor of their set,
1492020	1494020	you just run it by them in their dressing room.
1494020	1497020	Just go, hey, we got to tear up the floor of your set.
1497020	1498020	It's mirrors.
1498020	1500020	It doesn't work for the cameras.
1500020	1502020	He'd probably be like, OK, cool.
1502020	1505020	I'm Picasso and Jesus.
1505020	1506020	OK, cool.
1506020	1507020	Wear SNL.
1507020	1508020	Goodbye.
1508020	1509020	But they didn't tell him.
1509020	1511020	I mean, of course he's going to be like, what the fuck?
1511020	1512020	They didn't even tell me.
1512020	1513020	I'm Picasso and Jesus.
1513020	1517020	And someone's recording him from 50 yards going, ooh, this is the best.
1517020	1521020	Are you comparing yourself to Kanye or a Jesus ringer?
1521020	1525020	What he's taught me is it doesn't matter.
1525020	1529020	We should all be a little more proud of ourselves, for God's sake.
1529020	1531020	I mean, seven number one albums.
1531020	1535020	Four albums ago is when he needed to stop being humble.
1535020	1538020	By our own rules that we've established.
1538020	1543020	Three number one albums you're allowed to start wearing a shoe for a hat.
1543020	1545020	We established that a long time ago.
1545020	1547020	Are you a big Kanye fan?
1547020	1552020	I don't really like his music, but I like his personality.
1552020	1555020	You just want permission to be Kanye West.
1555020	1561020	Well, no, I'm just defending a guy who's like, yeah, I do.
1561020	1566020	It's adorable that people were like, the lady was like,
1566020	1568020	he likes to stick stuff in his butt.
1568020	1571020	And then it's amazing that he bothers to get on Twitter.
1571020	1572020	He's like, come on, seriously.
1572020	1574020	I don't like anything in my butt.
1574020	1575020	It's him.
1575020	1581020	It's not like a PR company going, speaking of butt, go to Target.
1581020	1584020	It's like him going, come on, come on, y'all.
1584020	1585020	I don't put anything in my butt.
1585020	1586020	That's great.
1586020	1588020	That's accessible.
1588020	1591020	Is this similar to how people don't like to drink alone?
1591020	1593020	So the narcissism level, like, look at me.
1593020	1594020	This is amazing.
1594020	1596020	And so he's that big.
1596020	1598020	And you're like, oh, I look up to him someday.
1598020	1599020	Well, I don't know.
1599020	1600020	I don't know what that means.
1600020	1603020	I don't know what the insult begins with.
1603020	1605020	Oh, no, it's playful, like a kitten insult.
1605020	1607020	It's not like I'm going to hurt you, like stab you in the face.
1607020	1608020	Well, you can't.
1608020	1609020	I'm like Picasso.
1609020	1611020	You can't stab me.
1611020	1613020	You'd be stabbing thin air.
1613020	1617020	I'm Jesus.
1617020	1619020	So you want to be Kanye.
1619020	1620020	Like, are you like?
1620020	1621020	I am.
1621020	1623020	I am, aren't I?
1623020	1624020	I am Kanye.
1624020	1627020	Should we holodeck this?
1627020	1628020	Holodeck.
1628020	1629020	Holodeck.
1629020	1630020	Just me.
1630020	1631020	Being Kanye.
1631020	1634020	Well, OK.
1634020	1642020	And the winner for best musician for the MTV Music Awards is...
1642020	1644020	You want to read the envelope?
1644020	1647020	Shinai nai.
1647020	1648020	All right.
1648020	1650020	Put your ears and hands together.
1650020	1654020	It's Kanye West.
1654020	1658020	You know what?
1658020	1659020	This is bullshit.
1659020	1661020	This is bullshit.
1661020	1663020	Taylor Swift, get up here.
1663020	1665020	Taylor, Taylor, get up here.
1665020	1667020	She deserves this award.
1667020	1668020	This is bullshit.
1668020	1670020	I didn't work my ass off.
1670020	1673020	Taylor Swift did.
1673020	1675020	She deserves it.
1675020	1679020	I didn't know what else to do with that.
1680020	1683020	Taylor.
1683020	1686020	Kanye.
1686020	1688020	Oh!
1688020	1689020	Oh!
1689020	1690020	Oh!
1690020	1692020	Soul Powers.
1696020	1697020	Oh, you're so tasty.
1697020	1699020	Delicious, Kanye.
1699020	1700020	Cut to black.
1700020	1704020	Taylor.
1704020	1708020	Pentagon, 1978.
1709020	1711020	Pentagon.
1717020	1718020	Oh, shit.
1718020	1720020	It went the wrong way.
1724020	1725020	I think it's like...
1725020	1726020	What is it?
1726020	1729020	It's three lefts, two rights.
1730020	1737020	All right, finally.
1737020	1740020	I've been looking for you guys forever.
1740020	1742020	I went to a room.
1742020	1744020	There was a guy...
1744020	1750020	So anyways, we have a problem.
1750020	1756020	Well, where are the guys that help you with that?
1757020	1760020	Operation Delta has been a failure.
1760020	1763020	Oh!
1763020	1766020	The old Operation Delta is a failure.
1766020	1769020	Yeah, that we suspected is my...
1769020	1771020	Yeah.
1771020	1773020	Yeah, we didn't put our all into that one.
1773020	1775020	Yeah.
1775020	1777020	Oh, fuck.
1777020	1779020	Oh, shit.
1779020	1782020	Fire drill.
1782020	1785020	It's like you just know the air's going down.
1785020	1786020	We've got to get out of here.
1786020	1788020	It's a regular fire drill.
1788020	1790020	You know, everybody says don't use an elevator.
1790020	1791020	Fuck that shit.
1791020	1793020	Let's use the elevator.
1796020	1800020	It's in the way that you use it.
1800020	1804020	I'm believing it so much quicker than those stairs.
1804020	1806020	It's in the way that you use it.
1806020	1809020	So how about what Sally was wearing today?
1809020	1810020	What else?
1810020	1812020	What?
1813020	1816020	I mean, are you working for the Pentagon or...
1816020	1820020	The JCPenney's the gun.
1820020	1823020	Did the elevator stop and the door's not open?
1823020	1826020	Well, we're only on the quadra gun level.
1826020	1827020	Oh, okay.
1827020	1830020	Press the button again just in case.
1830020	1835020	It's in the way that you use it.
1835020	1838020	The buttons went up.
1839020	1841020	Okay.
1841020	1843020	Oh, fuck.
1843020	1844020	Lights go out.
1844020	1845020	Shit.
1845020	1846020	Oh, my God.
1846020	1848020	It doesn't mean anything.
1848020	1849020	That doesn't mean anything.
1849020	1852020	It means the doors are about to open because they're trying to save electricity.
1852020	1853020	No.
1853020	1855020	What?
1855020	1858020	I don't want to freak you guys out, but when the stuff like this happens,
1858020	1861020	if I can't see things, I have little flashbacks as a child
1861020	1864020	and I start to get uncomfortable and weird things happen.
1864020	1865020	Okay.
1869020	1871020	All right.
1871020	1874020	Cut to Derek's flashbacks of the child.
1878020	1882020	Son, happy birthday.
1882020	1885020	This is your new hammock.
1887020	1888020	Thanks.
1888020	1889020	This is so comfortable.
1889020	1891020	I've never had anything like this before.
1891020	1892020	Daddy Derek.
1892020	1893020	Daddy Derek.
1893020	1895020	Snip, snip, snip.
1895020	1896020	No.
1896020	1897020	No.
1897020	1898020	God damn it.
1898020	1899020	No.
1899020	1900020	Back to the elevator.
1900020	1901020	Back to the elevator.
1903020	1906020	And she was really mean to me, and so that's what happened.
1906020	1908020	She called you Fatty Karen?
1908020	1910020	Yeah.
1910020	1912020	She had like a speech impediment, a really high-pitched voice,
1912020	1914020	and she couldn't say my name right.
1914020	1915020	What is your name again?
1915020	1917020	Derek Karen Mears.
1917020	1918020	Oh, okay.
1918020	1921020	The lights are still out, you guys.
1921020	1926020	If you don't know, I've taken control of your elevator car.
1926020	1928020	Kanye West?
1931020	1932020	Yeah.
1935020	1941020	You have 30 seconds to make the greatest rap album of all time.
1945020	1947020	He can do it.
1947020	1949020	He can do it.
1949020	1950020	Don't, you know, okay.
1950020	1951020	He can do it.
1951020	1952020	All right.
1952020	1953020	You're Jesus Picasso.
1953020	1954020	You can do it.
1955020	1956020	You can do it.
1956020	1958020	It's really confined in here, but try to...
1958020	1960020	Yeah, well, we'll sit down.
1960020	1962020	Well, no, that's okay.
1962020	1963020	All right.
1963020	1965020	That kind of...
1965020	1966020	All right.
1966020	1967020	Okay.
1968020	1969020	Yeah.
1974020	1975020	Oh, yeah.
1975020	1981020	Put your elevator action together for K.W. West.
1985020	1988020	A circle is a daydream.
1988020	1992020	A circle is a square to me.
1992020	1999020	A circle is another shape inside my school and playground.
1999020	2003020	I'm singing like a lady.
2003020	2007020	I'm singing like I would never had tomorrow.
2007020	2014020	I'm singing like I love the shapes of circles and squares and triangles.
2014020	2021020	When the grass is green and the sun is yellow,
2021020	2025020	I saw your mama tonight.
2025020	2034020	I heard she's turned into a fellow that's not transphobic.
2034020	2039020	I support her wholeheartedly in her change.
2039020	2050020	If she wants to be whoever she wants to be, she should be, she should be, she should be...
2051020	2058020	She should be, she should be, she should be tomorrow.
2058020	2065020	A circle is a square, every sun is a rainbow.
2065020	2072020	Every day is today, a mess, a mess, it turns into tomorrow.
2072020	2080020	A triangle is three, a square is more than that.
2080020	2087020	A circle has zero, but you are a hero if you want to know that.
2088020	2107020	And then I do nine more songs like that and obviously you've been bested.
2107020	2113020	It's like we have a budget for the elevator narrator and we don't have the budget for the elevator maintenance.
2113020	2116020	No wonder we lost the last three wars.
2116020	2121020	It's crazy.
2121020	2126020	Can't see my watch.
2126020	2127020	Ah, finally.
2127020	2135020	Thank God the ghost is here.
2135020	2140020	He's got some door.
2140020	2146020	Come through mine.
2146020	2151020	Thanks, my only friend.
2151020	2155020	Let's get you a new hammock.
2155020	2158020	I had nothing to do with the hammock.
2158020	2161020	I was in his flashback.
2161020	2162020	You know what?
2162020	2164020	I'm scrubbing the Delta Project.
2164020	2165020	That's what I came to tell you guys.
2165020	2169020	I was going to take you to lunch, break it to you slowly over mozzarella sticks.
2169020	2171020	You admitted yourselves.
2171020	2173020	You phoned it in.
2173020	2176020	Mozzarella sticks.
2176020	2178020	Get your own now.
2178020	2179020	So long.
2179020	2182020	But you should...
2182020	2186020	What's he doing with that apple?
2186020	2191020	He's eating it.
2191020	2198020	It's a nano apple.
2198020	2206020	So long, suckers.
2206020	2209020	Wasn't that nano apple part of the Delta Project?
2209020	2216020	It was, but I think he meant it to be a cheese dick.
2216020	2219020	A cheese dick?
2219020	2224020	Yes.
2224020	2242020	Want to go back to giving me head?
2242020	2245020	Was it like that?
2245020	2247020	Exactly.
2247020	2250020	Can we have a serious conversation for a second?
2250020	2254020	Dan, I love you.
2254020	2256020	Who died?
2256020	2259020	That scene.
2259020	2261020	Spencer, how have you been?
2261020	2264020	I've been so good.
2264020	2266020	There's something in...
2266020	2267020	I know.
2267020	2270020	You've been messing with it and looking at it for minutes.
2270020	2271020	I feel like...
2271020	2272020	What do you think...
2272020	2273020	What is it?
2273020	2274020	Drink it, man.
2274020	2276020	Just drink it.
2276020	2279020	You got some sort of weird thing in your vodka?
2279020	2282020	It's like the lowest-stakes creep show ever.
2282020	2283020	I know what's in here.
2283020	2285020	There's just something down there.
2285020	2287020	There's some jewels in there.
2287020	2288020	Whatever it is, I got it.
2288020	2289020	No?
2289020	2293020	Oh, it's the reflection of my finger.
2293020	2301020	Oh, no.
2301020	2304020	You're like a bird.
2304020	2305020	No, it's still there.
2305020	2306020	Oh, but that's us.
2306020	2308020	Okay.
2308020	2310020	All right.
2310020	2312020	Oh, man.
2312020	2315020	I'm very phobic about impurities and stuff.
2315020	2320020	Whatever's in there, vodka will probably kill it, right?
2320020	2321020	Yeah, yeah.
2321020	2327020	Or the snakes will.
2327020	2329020	I love you so much.
2329020	2330020	Thank you.
2330020	2336020	Derek, tell us about getting kicked in the nuts by Will Smith.
2336020	2337020	Okay.
2337020	2338020	In Wild, Wild West.
2338020	2339020	Oh, my God.
2339020	2340020	Yeah.
2340020	2341020	As an actor, I was very lucky.
2341020	2347020	At one point, one of my first jobs was working on the stellar hit Wild, Wild, Wild West.
2347020	2349020	Wild, Wild West won.
2349020	2350020	Yeah.
2350020	2354020	Did you play the robot spider?
2354020	2356020	Attack of the robot spiders.
2356020	2357020	Yes.
2357020	2360020	Actually, it was the giant metalhead guy inside the spider.
2360020	2364020	And I was super nervous because I had to hit Will Smith for the first time, punching him
2364020	2365020	and whatnot.
2365020	2368020	But he had to kick me in the nards as well.
2368020	2372020	But when we were doing it, when you get kicked in the nards, you usually have a safety strap
2372020	2376020	that goes around your ankle all the way up through here, kind of like a belt.
2376020	2380020	So if someone hits you, it stops them from actually hitting your nard parts.
2380020	2381020	Yeah.
2381020	2382020	Hold on.
2382020	2383020	It gets good.
2383020	2386020	It's like a hammock, an upside-down hammock above the ground that is your nuts.
2386020	2387020	Absolutely.
2387020	2392020	It's supposed to hold the body that is Will Smith's ankle as he does the plopping into
2392020	2395020	it of kicking as hard as he can upward.
2395020	2397020	And that is the correct term, plopping.
2397020	2401020	As hard as he might try, if he kicks straight up in your dick, he's not going to get there
2401020	2403020	because it's attached to your feet.
2403020	2404020	Correct.
2404020	2407020	But if you go up at an angle, you get hit hard.
2407020	2408020	In the thigh?
2408020	2414020	In the upper groin area, where the connection between your hoop and the hop come together.
2415020	2417020	And your nuts are huge.
2419020	2422020	They're average man nuts.
2425020	2427020	But you're bigger than an average man.
2427020	2434020	So you say, oh, this diet coke is average size, but it's like you drink a special giant
2434020	2436020	diet coke can.
2436020	2439020	Wait, how big are like, what's average nut size?
2439020	2440020	Like a quarter?
2440020	2441020	Is that a nut?
2441020	2443020	Yeah, like a quarter.
2445020	2446020	Spencer's giant.
2446020	2449020	He has to make it like two times my size and nuts.
2449020	2450020	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2450020	2452020	But I'm special.
2452020	2453020	Also, what do you have me on the show?
2453020	2454020	Quality.
2454020	2455020	Quality the entire time.
2455020	2456020	So anyways, you have many other nuts.
2456020	2460020	So anyways, the story that you're making me tell, we did it about like...
2460020	2463020	I expected you to go, I don't want to talk about that.
2463020	2465020	About 20 takes happened.
2465020	2467020	Not one was straight up and they're side to side.
2467020	2471020	And I felt like a kickboxer because it got to the point where I kept getting kicked over
2471020	2472020	and over.
2472020	2475020	And it's kind of like Rocky where he'd start to buckle and be like...
2475020	2478020	When I was a kid, I was so new going, no, no, no, this is good.
2478020	2481020	He's not kicking straight up, he's kicking into the thigh.
2481020	2483020	And you want it straight up.
2483020	2489020	But he's, I'm assuming not kicking you straight up because instinct says, if I kick this
2489020	2493020	guy as hard as I can straight up, that's going to be like kicking a human being in the balls.
2493020	2495020	So he's kicking you into the thigh.
2495020	2496020	Yes.
2496020	2498020	Probably to be a good person, but he's doing it wrong.
2498020	2499020	Correct.
2499020	2502020	But he makes more than I do and he can hire me in the future.
2502020	2505020	He did it completely right and it was my fault.
2505020	2510020	But no, afterwards I had it just like, just think of the blackest purple.
2510020	2514020	Like I went to the trailer and I kind of hobbled to the trailer and lay there and just had
2514020	2518020	these giant like volleyball sides on both sides, like bruises.
2518020	2523020	And the thing is, when you're a young stuntman, like, like, I think what you addressed to
2523020	2528020	me is like you have, you're in this terrible dilemma because it's like you, you can't like
2528020	2530020	stop between the 30th take.
2530020	2534020	And by the way, I met the dude that was in an acting class.
2534020	2535020	Yes.
2535020	2536020	Believe it or not.
2536020	2543020	I was in an acting class at Sam Christensen's class and one of the classmates was the guy
2543020	2550020	who played Marco in Die Hard, who is the guy who says, next time you're going to shoot
2550020	2553020	somebody, don't hesitate.
2553020	2557020	Thanks for the advice, asshole.
2557020	2565020	That guy, I'm sorry, but well, because I was thinking of that guy because he told me,
2565020	2569020	because he's a stuntman, a lot of the terrorists in Die Hard, they're just stuntmen.
2569020	2573020	Like, because they had to do rolls and dives and tucks and nips and things.
2573020	2576020	And he's like, I felt...
2576020	2578020	So racist.
2578020	2590020	A moment of silence for that moment of silence.
2590020	2593020	He ruined his back during Die Hard.
2593020	2598020	I think he never could do stunt work again because that was his biggest gig and it was
2598020	2600020	the most benign thing you'd see in Die Hard.
2600020	2606020	There's a moment when he's talking and then some dudes come in the doorway and he goes,
2606020	2612020	it's like, they catch Bruce Willis off guard and he draws down on them and there's just
2612020	2616020	a two second shot of the doorway and the guys scatter.
2616020	2621020	And in that shot, Marco vaults over an office chair, does a little dive.
2621020	2623020	It's not that big a deal.
2623020	2626020	The movie's not called Rhythm Gymnastics Hard.
2626020	2629020	It's not like, whoa, they'll blow you away with the wonderful cartwheels.
2629020	2633020	But he did this move that he then had to do 46 times.
2633020	2636020	Literally, I think, did 46 takes of that shot.
2636020	2642020	And he could never stop at take 23 and say, I'm out.
2642020	2643020	I can't do this.
2643020	2644020	I'm going to ruin my body.
2644020	2647020	And Will Smith is kicking you in the nets for the 18th time.
2647020	2648020	And you're not...
2648020	2652020	You're faced with this crazy choice of, well, what am I going to be the stunt man that's
2652020	2656020	gotten this far and then goes, I can't take it, boys.
2656020	2660020	You're allowed to at any point say, okay, I'm hurt.
2660020	2665020	But if you do it, like, oh, shit, go home and we never hire you again.
2665020	2668020	Yeah, I think if you're a veteran, you probably get away with it more, right?
2668020	2672020	Well, the mentality between acting as stunts...
2672020	2674020	It's white collar, blue collar.
2674020	2678020	On the stunt side of things, your job is to make the stunt pointer who hired you look
2678020	2679020	as good as possible.
2679020	2685020	So if you ever get hurt or injured on set, you shouldn't as a professional scream out
2685020	2687020	and go, ah, my arm is broken and I can't feel.
2687020	2688020	You'd be very quiet.
2688020	2692020	And if you're hurt, you leave set so you don't cause that panic on set and people freak
2692020	2695020	out because you'll interrupt the workday, then they don't make their day and then there's
2695020	2696020	money involved and whatnot.
2696020	2701020	But you go in, you take it, you wrap whatever hurt and you go back and you finish the job
2701020	2705020	for the day if your mentality is right and then you heal up later.
2705020	2706020	You got pretty hurt.
2706020	2710020	A separated shoulder or something like that?
2710020	2711020	Oh, no, no.
2711020	2713020	I had a really bad herniated disc in my neck.
2713020	2715020	It was the toughest job I've ever done.
2715020	2716020	I did Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters.
2716020	2717020	I was just going to bring that up.
2717020	2718020	Yeah.
2718020	2722020	I couldn't wait to bring that up because I watched that entire movie.
2722020	2723020	I thought that fucker was CG.
2723020	2725020	That was you in a costume.
2725020	2726020	Yeah, that was crazy.
2726020	2727020	That troll.
2727020	2728020	That big ogre thing.
2728020	2729020	That Edward the giant troll.
2729020	2730020	That was you in a costume.
2730020	2734020	Yeah, that was crazy.
2734020	2735020	We shot three months in Berlin.
2735020	2739020	The first week there, anything you do for these kind of monster jobs, because an actor,
2739020	2741020	I bounced to my normal face and doing monsters from time to time.
2741020	2745020	But anytime you do a monster job, you're always prepared ahead of time.
2745020	2747020	I always talk like a UFC fighter.
2747020	2750020	You'd overtrain so when you're on set, nothing's going to phase you.
2750020	2755020	But the suit was so difficult because originally the studio wanted to CG the character and
2755020	2757020	the producers and the director were fighting, going, no, we want to do it practical.
2757020	2760020	We have the right people and the right team together.
2760020	2761020	Let's do it practical.
2761020	2762020	And they're like, okay, we'll try it.
2762020	2764020	But the suit was so big.
2764020	2769020	I tried to explain to people when you put it on, it's like being on a treadmill with
2769020	2774020	like a hundred plus pound weight on your neck, shoulders, all over you.
2774020	2778020	You're breathing your own carbon dioxide so you can't breathe very well.
2778020	2781020	Your pulse is already, you're actually cooking inside the suit.
2781020	2785020	So imagine that and putting a plastic bag on your head and running blind.
2785020	2788020	And Will Smith kicking you in the nuts the entire time.
2788020	2790020	But yeah, it was crazy.
2790020	2792020	And he wasn't even on that job.
2792020	2793020	He just shows up.
2793020	2796020	Will Smith just fucking goes from set to set.
2796020	2797020	Well, he became addicted to it.
2797020	2798020	That's the thing.
2799020	2801020	Where's he going to taste for it?
2801020	2804020	He started to make excuses in your head.
2804020	2805020	I deserved it.
2805020	2806020	I shouldn't have made him do that.
2806020	2807020	It's called addiction.
2807020	2808020	It's called addiction.
2808020	2812020	He actually on Will Smith's behalf, like it was my kind of first like big Hollywood star
2812020	2813020	going, oh my God, I don't want to ruin this.
2813020	2815020	He was the nicest, most down to earth guy.
2815020	2819020	I was talking to one of his entourage at the time going like, is he doing a game or is
2819020	2820020	he legit?
2820020	2821020	No, no, no, man.
2821020	2823020	Will Smith is Will Smith 24 hours a day.
2823020	2824020	And he treated it.
2824020	2827020	It didn't matter if you were the caterer all the way up to the main producer.
2827020	2831020	He treated everybody equally with respect and I was blown away.
2831020	2833020	I learned a lot from him.
2833020	2834020	All right.
2834020	2835020	Now, Derek.
2835020	2836020	Yeah.
2836020	2837020	What?
2837020	2838020	Sounds pretty cool.
2838020	2840020	Sounds pretty cool.
2840020	2845020	I'd like to work with him someday.
2845020	2848020	Derek, am I getting this wrong?
2848020	2852020	Derek and I used to be roommates for a while back in the day.
2852020	2853020	Yeah.
2853020	2858020	When you auditioned for that, they had you come in...
2858020	2859020	For Wild Wild West.
2859020	2860020	For Wild Wild West.
2860020	2861020	Mm-hmm.
2861020	2862020	One.
2862020	2864020	Did they do some kicks or something like that?
2864020	2865020	Mm-hmm.
2865020	2869020	Wasn't there a thing like this that they do like a high kick and you're like, no, I'll
2869020	2870020	kick a hole in the ceiling?
2870020	2871020	No.
2871020	2874020	No, there was a small room or whatever and there was like a low hanging.
2874020	2877020	My background's like martial arts and stuff and so they're like, oh, go ahead.
2877020	2880020	Can you kick over your head and go, yeah, I can stop here.
2880020	2881020	I don't like...
2881020	2882020	Why?
2882020	2883020	It's a light thing.
2883020	2884020	I don't want to do that.
2884020	2886020	And I'm like, go ahead and do it.
2886020	2889020	Yeah, yeah, honey, kick through.
2889020	2891020	You kick the ceiling out and they're like, you got the fucking job.
2891020	2896020	Also, on the side note, like being Jeff's roommate, like talk about like...
2901020	2902020	Talk about...
2902020	2906020	This motherfucker leaves the toilet seat up.
2906020	2908020	The refrigerator door open.
2909020	2912020	If you just moved to Hollywood and you're looking for self-confidence, don't move in
2912020	2914020	with Davis.
2914020	2919020	That guy is a sweetheart of a human being, just like a brother to me.
2919020	2926020	Well, all of his waking nightmares about 9-11...
2926020	2937020	I would date skinny, like, weak, like, you know, thin actresses.
2937020	2944020	Derek would date giant, hard-ass stunt women who like looked like Xena, warrior princess.
2944020	2949020	So I'd be in my little bedroom and be like, maybe, no, like, you wanted me.
2949020	2951020	Like, you should eat something.
2951020	2956020	And that was him talking to me.
2956020	2957020	Stunt talk.
2957020	2961020	And then from Derek's room, it was boom, come on, boom, boom.
2961020	2962020	They were doing...
2962020	2965020	You guys were wrestling so hard.
2965020	2966020	Furniture was flying.
2966020	2967020	Razzling.
2967020	2972020	Me and my skinny actor's girlfriend were like, are they okay?
2972020	2973020	Yeah, they're...
2973020	2978020	I live with a superhero.
2978020	2980020	Also, Derek would do a thing.
2980020	2983020	First time we lived at the Serrano...
2983020	2985020	Like, in the Koreatown.
2985020	2987020	Derek, you know, he's...
2987020	2988020	What are you, six?
2988020	2989020	Six-five.
2989020	2990020	Six-five.
2990020	2993020	Totally hairless.
2993020	2995020	Very muscular.
2995020	2996020	He's trying to create a picture for you.
2996020	2999020	Yeah.
2999020	3001020	For the home listener.
3001020	3002020	It's a podcast.
3002020	3003020	Kind of a Mr. Clean look.
3003020	3004020	It's a podcast.
3004020	3006020	Mr. Clean.
3006020	3010020	Derek would come out, and I'd be playing his PlayStation.
3010020	3012020	I'd be doing, like, some Tomb Raider or whatever.
3012020	3015020	And Derek would come out in his tighty-whities.
3015020	3018020	And he would do this.
3018020	3019020	Oh, boy.
3019020	3021020	I called it the pretty prancer.
3021020	3025020	He would come out of the bathroom and he would go...
3025020	3030020	Imagine him in Naked, except for tighty-whities,
3030020	3032020	and he would go...
3033020	3034020	Jeff.
3034020	3036020	Jeff.
3036020	3040020	Am I a pretty prancer?
3040020	3043020	Yes, Derek.
3043020	3046020	You're a pretty pony.
3050020	3051020	It was the best.
3051020	3052020	Oh, good times.
3052020	3055020	Good times.
3055020	3058020	But the point I was trying to make with Jeff coming over...
3058020	3061020	It was Jeff as a roommate is, like, I would sit there,
3061020	3063020	and I had the same spot on the couch.
3063020	3065020	I was that friend, you know, who's, like, disheveled,
3065020	3067020	and like, oh, I was gonna play Tomb Raider on PlayStation 2.
3067020	3068020	This is great.
3068020	3071020	And it was, like, a revolving door of, like, beautiful, hot,
3071020	3073020	like, eccentric women would come in.
3073020	3075020	And, like, I would sit there, and...
3075020	3077020	I would sit there, and I would sit there,
3077020	3079020	and I would sit there, and I would sit there,
3079020	3081020	and I would sit there, and I would sit there,
3081020	3083020	and I would sit there, and I would sit there,
3083020	3085020	and I would sit there, and they were talking, like,
3085020	3086020	Don Perignon.
3086020	3088020	I feel like the kid from Deliverance.
3088020	3090020	I'm like, what's going on?
3090020	3092020	You know, Jeff's a real funny dude.
3092020	3095020	You should have a good time tonight.
3095020	3097020	But they had to put up with me, because, like, you know,
3097020	3099020	they were dating Jeff, and they were closer.
3099020	3101020	You guys could have leaned into that.
3101020	3104020	You could have done, like, just skin-tight latex,
3104020	3106020	like, on a Friday night.
3106020	3108020	Like, are you going out tonight?
3108020	3109020	Yeah, yeah.
3109020	3111020	I'm gonna probably bring some women home.
3111020	3113020	You want me to do the, you know, the thing?
3113020	3114020	Yeah.
3114020	3117020	You want me to just be in the cabinet under the sink?
3121020	3123020	That would be amazing.
3123020	3125020	And then you do your high kicks.
3125020	3127020	And then Will Smith comes out of a different cabinet
3127020	3129020	and starts kicking you in the nuts.
3129020	3130020	Like, like...
3130020	3131020	Is that Will Smith? He's really nice.
3131020	3132020	Derek, flat footed.
3132020	3133020	Flat footed.
3133020	3134020	You could kick the ceiling probably here, right?
3134020	3135020	I think I can.
3135020	3136020	Still?
3136020	3137020	All right. I'm still...
3137020	3138020	I'm tighter than I used to be.
3138020	3139020	I could fall. It'd be awesome.
3139020	3140020	You got them tatters.
3140020	3141020	I'll try it.
3141020	3142020	I'll try it.
3142020	3143020	Just try it.
3143020	3144020	Try it.
3144020	3145020	I mean, I think flat...
3145020	3146020	Oh, yeah.
3146020	3147020	These are...
3147020	3148020	He's wearing jeans.
3148020	3149020	Whoa.
3149020	3150020	Jesus Christ.
3150020	3151020	He kicked it.
3151020	3152020	Whoa.
3152020	3153020	Jesus.
3153020	3154020	He chopped it.
3154020	3155020	Nice.
3155020	3156020	He...
3156020	3157020	Yeah.
3157020	3158020	Yeah, that was...
3158020	3161020	Guys, if any sort of terror erupts,
3161020	3162020	I got your back.
3162020	3163020	Dance.
3163020	3164020	Dance.
3164020	3165020	Do it.
3165020	3166020	This is a...
3166020	3168020	This is a horrible idea.
3168020	3169020	Game-recognized game.
3170020	3171020	That's the way it goes.
3171020	3172020	Yeah.
3172020	3173020	That's the way it goes.
3173020	3174020	Yeah.
3174020	3175020	Nice.
3175020	3176020	Nice.
3176020	3177020	Nice.
3177020	3178020	Great.
3178020	3179020	Great.
3179020	3191020	You really are Picasso Jesus.
3191020	3193020	Yeah.
3193020	3195020	I was actually kind of curious about the
3196020	3200020	I was actually kind of curious like how like what the
3200020	3203020	disparity is like how how far my leg goes up.
3203020	3206020	I think it was like you got pretty close.
3220020	3223020	If you go to your chiropractor and it's like why he's
3223020	3226020	fixed your back and then he's like have you done those
3226020	3229020	exercises and you have it.
3229020	3233020	And then because you're busy and then you're like if I
3233020	3236020	just say no then I have which I've already tried I've
3236020	3238020	tried to be honest because like have you done those
3238020	3239020	exercises.
3239020	3242020	They're like core exercises like where you work your
3242020	3243020	core.
3243020	3244020	It's for my posture.
3244020	3249020	I don't like my posture but I don't I don't like doing
3249020	3250020	the exercises either.
3250020	3254020	So my hands are tied.
3254020	3258020	So so I like so once a week I go into him and he goes
3258020	3260020	he's adjusting my back and then he goes did you do those
3260020	3261020	exercises.
3261020	3263020	And then I tried.
3263020	3264020	I already tried.
3264020	3268020	I tried.
3268020	3269020	Okay.
3269020	3270020	That's fine.
3270020	3271020	That's the same as my alarm tone.
3271020	3275020	It's worth because we live in an Orwellian society.
3275020	3277020	It's not like yours was going to be it's in the way
3277020	3279020	that you use it.
3279020	3283020	The Kevin Day is like God damn it.
3283020	3284020	That's Eric Clapton.
3284020	3287020	You just get sued.
3287020	3290020	The I don't do the I already tried.
3290020	3292020	I tried going no.
3292020	3293020	By the way.
3293020	3295020	Now I'm not going to tell you his name because then you
3295020	3298020	might Yelp him and like harass him.
3298020	3299020	Dr.
3299020	3300020	X.
3300020	3301020	No Dr.
3301020	3302020	X.
3302020	3304020	But by the way X is his first name because not a real
3304020	3306020	doctor chiropractor like Dr.
3306020	3308020	Todd you know.
3308020	3309020	No Dr.
3309020	3310020	Todd.
3310020	3312020	I did not do the exercises this week.
3312020	3313020	I didn't do them.
3313020	3317020	And then his reaction is like okay well can I ask you a
3317020	3318020	question.
3318020	3320020	Do you want to have better posture.
3320020	3321020	Yes I do Dr.
3321020	3322020	Todd.
3322020	3325020	Well you can't have it if I can't help you if you're
3325020	3327020	if you're going to because if you don't want to do it then
3327020	3328020	you don't want to do it.
3328020	3331020	Wasn't he like well if you want don't want to waste my
3331020	3334020	time or like something like he was wasting your time.
3334020	3336020	Well that's when I cancel an appointment.
3336020	3339020	He was like but it's like I pay for the appointment.
3339020	3341020	Oh I thought he was like you're not going to stretch
3341020	3342020	you're just wasting my time.
3342020	3346020	Well he's like he was like well if you don't if you
3346020	3348020	don't want to do it like like I don't know what to do
3348020	3349020	with you.
3349020	3352020	And so then I tried lying a little bit like so then the
3352020	3354020	next time he goes like you know the exercises I hadn't
3354020	3357020	and so I tried lying just enough because I didn't get
3357020	3360020	the right it was like so I was like yeah a couple times
3360020	3364020	he's like yeah like how often I'm like oh here and
3364020	3369020	there like like once every other day try it a little
3369020	3370020	bit.
3370020	3373020	And then he said well I can't you know look I mean I
3373020	3375020	want to help your posture but I can't I can't work with
3375020	3377020	you if it's like once every other day and I did an
3377020	3381020	impression of my voice and like and it was like I just
3381020	3383020	was like I was just like I got my face in a table while
3383020	3386020	he's doing that shit and I'm like I just like I don't
3386020	3389020	need to put up with this motherfucker supposed to
3389020	3393020	crack my back and then but then I think what if I
3393020	3396020	don't know what I'm doing to him and then my back
3396020	3397020	feels bad.
3397020	3399020	He'll know he works.
3399020	3401020	That seems like the best item.
3401020	3404020	And then I go back to him and then he's like I don't
3404020	3406020	know like I throw a pebble at his window.
3406020	3409020	Dr. Todd.
3409020	3412020	I hold up a boom box and it's playing the shitty
3412020	3417020	music version of whatever he plays over his fucking
3417020	3420020	shitty new age sound system.
3420020	3423020	Have you tried actually doing his instructions and
3423020	3424020	doing that?
3424020	3425020	Yeah.
3425020	3426020	Let's do them right now.
3426020	3427020	No they're on there.
3427020	3429020	No they don't applaud that.
3429020	3430020	No no no no.
3430020	3431020	They'll applaud for this.
3431020	3432020	Let's do it.
3432020	3434020	I think if you did it right now then you could be
3434020	3435020	truthful.
3435020	3436020	You don't like lying.
3436020	3437020	No I don't want this person.
3437020	3438020	He won't even accept.
3438020	3441020	I already know that even if I did him a lot according
3441020	3443020	to me that wouldn't be enough for him.
3443020	3445020	Okay then definitely don't do him.
3445020	3446020	Yeah.
3446020	3447020	Yeah.
3447020	3448020	So do I have to stop going to him?
3448020	3449020	No.
3449020	3451020	He's trying to help you.
3451020	3454020	But I don't have time to do the exercises bro.
3454020	3455020	Wait.
3455020	3457020	What are the exercises and how long?
3457020	3458020	Yeah.
3458020	3459020	Like 15 seconds.
3459020	3464020	I just got to lay down on the floor and go and like
3464020	3465020	go like this.
3465020	3467020	It's like for my core.
3467020	3468020	I don't have a core.
3468020	3470020	Do it every time you have to pee.
3470020	3471020	15 seconds.
3471020	3472020	When you got to pee.
3472020	3474020	You can't even try it just as an experiment to see
3474020	3475020	if he's a good decorator.
3475020	3477020	If history is any teacher no I cannot.
3477020	3478020	I don't.
3478020	3479020	I'm not able to do it.
3479020	3481020	It doesn't work into my schedule right now.
3481020	3484020	I can't have Steve Levy put on my calendar.
3484020	3485020	Do it when you pee.
3485020	3488020	Thrust your fucking hips for 15 seconds.
3488020	3491020	My calendar already looks like this every day is like
3491020	3492020	what?
3492020	3493020	Like what?
3493020	3494020	Read the Bible.
3494020	3495020	What?
3495020	3497020	I have to do so much shit.
3497020	3499020	There's going to be like slivers added in there
3499020	3501020	like thrust your hips against the wall.
3501020	3503020	Have you cut Minecraft out of your schedule?
3503020	3504020	Dude.
3504020	3513020	I don't play no Minecraft.
3513020	3515020	Knights of pen and paper too.
3515020	3518020	I got a couple hours in yesterday.
3518020	3521020	I don't touch console games or laptop games.
3521020	3524020	I only do iPad time management games.
3524020	3528020	They're teaching me time management.
3528020	3529020	Are you still in pain?
3529020	3530020	Is your back like?
3530020	3531020	No.
3531020	3532020	That's the thing.
3532020	3533020	So why would I ever do these exercises?
3533020	3534020	Don't go.
3534020	3535020	Don't go.
3535020	3536020	You sound like you're busy.
3536020	3537020	I don't like my back.
3537020	3538020	You sound so busy Dan.
3538020	3539020	You sound so busy.
3539020	3540020	You need to relax.
3540020	3541020	Take it easy.
3541020	3542020	Don't go.
3542020	3545020	If you don't like him, you don't like him.
3545020	3546020	You don't like him.
3546020	3548020	You don't like what he's telling you to do.
3548020	3549020	Stop it.
3549020	3550020	Just don't go.
3550020	3551020	I worry about you man.
3551020	3552020	Don't go.
3552020	3553020	Just stay.
3553020	3558020	Just stay home.
3558020	3563620	Well, I mean, I, Steve, can you put on the calendar that I got a, I'm supposed to lay
3563620	3569340	on the ground and then there's a piece of paper that shows a lady doing it.
3569340	3574020	It's like, I gotta like, it doesn't even make sense.
3574020	3578020	Can you show yourself how to fix it?
3578020	3579020	No, I can't.
3579020	3580020	Cause it's a stage.
3580020	3581540	There's, I can't, no, I can't show you.
3581540	3582540	I'll describe it.
3582540	3583540	I'll describe it.
3583540	3584940	If you do it, show us what you're supposed to do.
3584940	3587580	It's going to look like a man laying down.
3587580	3588580	Yeah.
3588580	3589580	Well, let's try it on.
3589580	3591860	But if you do it in the future and they ask you like, did you do it or not?
3591860	3595020	You can play your, your hit podcast and have everybody going, yay.
3595020	3601460	Maybe these people, your witnesses, do it on the table, do it on the table, do it on
3601460	3602460	the table.
3602460	3603460	Don't do it on the table.
3603460	3604460	Lay down.
3604460	3605460	That's a bad idea.
3605460	3607460	That table seems like it's not really, but that would be perfect.
3607460	3608460	That would be great.
3608460	3609460	Just do it on the table.
3609460	3610460	Just do it on the table.
3611460	3612460	Just do it on the table.
3612460	3622580	I mean, like, I hate, I hate, I hate these parts of the podcast because it's like, I
3622580	3625780	always, I always imagined being the person that's here for the first time.
3625780	3627580	And they're like, why did you take me here?
3627580	3630500	Well, cause he's a great writer.
3630500	3631500	He's not writing.
3631500	3633140	Just laying in his back with his knees up.
3633140	3634140	Okay.
3634140	3635140	So this is the exercise.
3635140	3637580	Like my, I think kind of off people.
3637580	3639820	I go like this one.
3640180	3641180	I think I just go like that.
3641180	3642180	I think.
3642180	3643180	I can't remember.
3643180	3644180	I can't tell what's happening.
3644180	3645180	No, no, no.
3645180	3647980	I keep my ass on the floor and then the small on my back is supposed to be like that.
3647980	3653500	Keep reaching for the stars and then, and then, and then I flatten it and then I go
3653500	3654500	like that.
3654500	3655500	It's three.
3655500	3656500	And then I flatten it.
3656500	3657500	He's arching his back.
3657500	3658500	Right.
3658500	3659500	Four.
3659500	3660500	I'm just looking right here.
3660500	3661500	Crotch.
3661500	3662500	I can't see anything.
3662500	3663500	So podcast dynamite.
3663500	3664500	Right.
3664500	3665500	Right.
3665500	3668020	We're getting you some exercise.
3668020	3671380	You have possible deniability now with your, with your chiropractor.
3671380	3674900	If he, if he said once a week, do it, then I could do it every week here.
3674900	3675900	Yeah.
3675900	3676900	You, you could put on it.
3676900	3679180	You could put on a rap beat and I could like, I could do a flat.
3679180	3680180	I could do a core.
3680180	3681180	Yeah.
3681180	3684180	Do it to the beat.
3684180	3685180	Yeah.

3701180	3702180	Pitch between your ass and your back.
3702180	3703180	It's called your core.
3703180	3704180	Gonna keep your life on track.
3704180	3705180	It's gonna make your posture clean.
3705180	3706180	Gonna make it neat.
3706180	3707780	I'm gonna fuck your mama so hard.
3707780	3709740	I'm bringing the heat pad.
3709740	3713100	Heat pad going down on your cool crack.
3713100	3714660	Your fucking mama's so hard.
3714660	3716540	She's going forward and back.
3716540	3717720	I'll cure her back.
3717720	3719280	You'll straighten her spine.
3719280	3721200	I'll fuck your mama like Curly.
3721200	3723060	Fuck her like Larry Fines.
3723060	3724060	Whoa.

3733140	3735220	I fucked your mama so hard.
3735220	3738220	You know what I mean.
3743620	3748620	Unenthusiastic applause.
3748620	3752620	There are three kinds of applause in the world.
3752620	3753620	Enthusiastic.
3757420	3760420	Everybody put your hands together for Kanye Jesus.
3762420	3763420	Aw shit.
3763420	3765420	Kanye Jesus.
3765420	3766420	Yo.

3769420	3772420	I'm Mr. Back Problems coming around.
3772420	3773420	I'm a new character.
3773420	3775420	I'm Mr. Back Problems.
3775420	3776420	I love bad backs.
3776420	3779420	I'm a rhythmologist of the bad backs.
3779420	3781420	I'm Mr. Back Problems.
3781420	3783420	I'm Mr. Back Problems.
3783420	3785420	It's a new character.

3790420	3791420	She's Dave Klein.
3791420	3792420	Andy?
3792420	3793420	Dave Klein.
3793420	3796420	Stand up and show people why I would confuse you.
3796420	3797420	I'm not a dick.
3806420	3809420	We're breeding a super race.
3810420	3813420	Yo, what if these guys...
3813420	3816420	This would be a perfect tag team wrestling match.
3825420	3828420	The Banger Brothers are coming out.
3828420	3834420	Oh, here come the follicle friends.
3836420	3837420	Hey, Derek.
3837420	3841420	Derek, remember, before Channel 101 was a thing,
3841420	3844420	Dan, Rob, Chris Tomlin and I, we get together and we said,
3844420	3847420	like, let's make Jaws 4.
3847420	3849420	No one has seen Jaws 4.
3849420	3850420	Let's make Jaws 4.
3850420	3853420	Rob made the most shocking thing in the world where he...
3853420	3855420	It's kind of the beginning of everything for me.
3855420	3856420	Exactly.
3856420	3857420	Rob fucked a lemon.
3857420	3858420	Pretty hard.
3858420	3859420	Orange or a lemon?
3859420	3861420	It wasn't orange, but it was a little on the yellow side.
3861420	3862420	It came off lemon on camera.
3862420	3863420	No, right.
3863420	3864420	Yeah.
3865420	3867420	My dick was Jaws.
3867420	3869420	His dick was Jaws.
3869420	3874420	He made a duct tape fin with a number 4 on it.
3877420	3880420	Am I right in saying that Bill Cosby was...
3880420	3881420	No, it was Michael Caine.
3881420	3882420	Michael Caine.
3882420	3884420	But he talked like Bill Cosby.
3884420	3886420	He said, oh, I'm Michael Caine.
3886420	3888420	I'm Michael Caine.
3889420	3891420	Is that still online?
3891420	3892420	It's the worst.
3892420	3897420	You know, Comedy Central put it on their homepage at one point,
3897420	3903420	not realizing that my dick was in it because Sarah said...
3903420	3904420	Sarah loved it.
3904420	3907420	Sarah saw that video and said,
3907420	3910420	I want this guy to direct my pilot.
3913420	3916420	And then somebody said, oh, it's like on 101.
3916420	3919420	And then they went, oh, okay, well, we'll put a link up to that.
3919420	3921420	And it was up there for like a week.
3921420	3923420	And we're going, holy shit.
3923420	3925420	A little warning.
3925420	3927420	There's a dick in there.
3927420	3929420	And then they pulled it down.
3929420	3931420	There's one line of dialogue and I won't repeat.
3931420	3934420	It's pretty fucking...it's pretty out there.
3934420	3936420	You know what I'm talking about.
3936420	3937420	No.
3937420	3938420	I'm not going to say it.
3938420	3939420	Okay.
3939420	3941420	I will let the audience watch it.
3941420	3942420	I don't think it's up there anymore.
3942420	3943420	No.
3943420	3944420	I took it down.
3944420	3945420	YouTube won't have it?
3945420	3946420	I don't think so.
3946420	3947420	Jaws 4 must exist.
3947420	3948420	I don't think so.
3948420	3949420	It's so good.
3949420	3950420	I can't believe it's not out there.
3950420	3955420	But then I think right after that we all said, let's make...everybody make the next Batman.
3955420	3956420	Yeah.
3956420	3958420	And so Dan made a Batman.
3958420	3961420	We just also...if you haven't seen Dan Harmon's Batman.
3961420	3962420	Dan's Batman is pretty funny.
3962420	3966420	It's also...it goes all the way around the bat.
3966420	3971420	When I remember about that Batman that I made is my dear girlfriend at the time, Robin Roth,
3971420	3973420	very lovely and talented, who was my roommate.
3973420	3976420	And she volunteered to...
3976420	3981420	because one of the seeds was it was a dark look into Batman's life.
3981420	3989420	And at one point he's...it just cuts to him in bed with his girlfriend wearing the Batman mask.
3989420	3995420	And he's saying to his girlfriend who is naked, get up on your knees.
3995420	3997420	I want to kiss you while I jerk off.
3997420	4003420	And it's just supposed to be creepy and sad and lonely because even when he's with someone he's alone.
4003420	4010420	And then...but she's...I remember I set up the camera on a tripod and we got into frame
4010420	4017420	and Robin's nipples were out of frame on the viewfinder.
4017420	4019420	This is the early days of digital video.
4019420	4022420	I remember just the kind of overscan.
4022420	4024420	I didn't know all the terminology.
4024420	4028420	I remember when the video went online it was like, no, her nipples are well in frame.
4028420	4032420	It's just my topless girlfriend giving me a hand job.
4032420	4033420	Anyway, I don't know.
4033420	4035420	The early...those are the days.
4035420	4041420	And then 9-11 happened and everyone...everything changed even though it's 9-13 now.
4041420	4042420	So we missed it.
4042420	4043420	Am I...
4043420	4044420	No, Jeff.
4044420	4047420	We'll never miss it.
4047420	4049420	You're right, Dan.
4049420	4055420	You know, it's 9-11 in our hearts.
4055420	4061420	And mine...I made of Batman and I asked Derek to be my villain in it.
4061420	4064420	And his character was called Pussy Magnet.
4064420	4071420	And he had a...I made him a necklace that was like a magnet with the word pussy on it.
4071420	4077420	And we showed up at your dojo and you're like, Jeff, I can do some karate moves.
4077420	4080420	It was to kickstart my heart, I think, with Motley Crue.
4080420	4083420	And you're like, I pulled my groin on a show.
4083420	4085420	And so I can't really do it.
4085420	4090420	If you can ever see this, you're doing giant flying kicks and everything.
4090420	4092420	You played so hard while hurt.
4092420	4093420	It's amazing.
4093420	4095420	But that's part of your thing.
4095420	4096420	It's because I love you.
4096420	4097420	Aw.
4097420	4098420	Hey, Derek.
4098420	4101420	Yeah.
4101420	4107420	So when I met you, like you were...I mean, like you...
4107420	4112420	I always say...I don't know if it's offensive to you because I'm trying to create an image in people's head.
4112420	4115420	Like you looked from the dude from Powder.
4115420	4118420	The first time I ever met you...
4118420	4123420	Because it's amazing when you meet somebody who's jacked up and looks good.
4123420	4130420	It's hard to imagine that they ever actually bothered to just transform themselves without permission.
4130420	4136420	But you could have easily just been a dude in a trench coat just hanging out on a campus behind a tree.
4137420	4142420	And just using psychic powers to get back at people.
4142420	4145420	But instead, you went this route.
4145420	4160420	And one of my questions is, can you remember that point in your life where you went from just what God had dealt you to deciding to just do stuff?
4160420	4162420	Did you get fit?
4162420	4163420	Yeah.
4163420	4165420	What was the threshold?
4165420	4166420	What pushed you across that threshold?
4166420	4167420	Well, it was well.
4167420	4170420	When I grew up in Bakersfield, California, and I grew up...
4170420	4174420	When it wasn't cool, it was like comic book, sci-fi, horror.
4174420	4178420	I got into acting because of Dungeons and Dragons going, oh, man, I want to do this someday professionally.
4178420	4179420	How do I do that?
4179420	4180420	Oh, an actor?
4180420	4181420	Perfect.
4181420	4183420	But I also grew up as a different kid because I had the alopecia.
4183420	4188420	And so what alopecia is for people who don't know is when your body rejects your hair.
4188420	4193420	I've had it my entire life, but just recently, like the last four years, I could grow a goatee for some reason.
4193420	4194420	Yeah, I know.
4194420	4195420	Which is bizarre.
4195420	4196420	I was like, liar.
4196420	4197420	Look at his facial hair.
4197420	4198420	No way.
4198420	4199420	Bull crap.
4199420	4202420	But it was weird also going to your friends who are an adult male and going, hey, how
4202420	4204420	do you, at 40 plus, going like, how do you shave?
4204420	4205420	Do you do this?
4205420	4206420	Has that stopped recently?
4206420	4207420	I remember the last time I saw you losing.
4207420	4208420	No, no.
4208420	4209420	I keep shaving it for shows.
4209420	4210420	Sometimes I'll grow it in for a show.
4210420	4212420	So all of a sudden, there's just this goatee out of nowhere.
4212420	4213420	Yeah.
4213420	4214420	Okay.
4214420	4215420	Yeah, we'll put a pin in that.
4215420	4216420	We'll talk about that in a second.
4216420	4217420	Yeah, but no, you got to the point.
4217420	4219420	I moved to L.A. to do acting and comedy.
4220420	4224420	Jeff was the one who turned me on to go into this class with Sam Christensen, where all
4224420	4228420	of you guys were going to class, and I joined him with everybody doing the Sam Christensen
4228420	4229420	class.
4229420	4230420	Me and Marco from Die Hard.
4230420	4231420	Yes.
4231420	4232420	Yes.
4232420	4235420	In that class, I learned about Joseph Campbell and Carl Young.
4235420	4237420	It's kind of an amalgamation of the two put together.
4237420	4241420	And I learned about my essences and what I give out as a human being.
4241420	4242420	I went, wait a second.
4242420	4245420	If I worked out, I could be like the big bad guy in TV and film.
4245420	4247420	Everyone's like, oh, you're like the jock in school.
4248420	4249420	You're the super fit guy.
4249420	4250420	I go, no.
4250420	4252420	I was the kid getting picked on.
4252420	4255420	I could maybe do a pull up or whatever, and that was about it.
4255420	4256420	Wait, so what did you learn in Sam's class?
4256420	4260420	You're saying you were in Sam's class when you were still scrawny, for lack of a better
4260420	4261420	word?
4261420	4262420	Yeah.
4262420	4265420	And so what were you hearing from Sam's class that made you think if you got jacked up?
4265420	4266420	What were you hearing?
4266420	4270420	Sam's really nice because he brings me up to other students where he talks about you
4270420	4274420	find out what your essences are, like when you walk into a room, what you give off to
4274420	4280420	people if you're just quiet, and just who they are.
4280420	4285420	In the old days, what we used to do is go to the airport, and for example, hypothetically,
4285420	4290420	we'd go there, and Dan would stay on the corner, and I have a list of adjectives on a piece
4290420	4294420	of paper, and I would walk around to strangers and go, hey, my friend Dan Harmon, we're in
4294420	4295420	an acting class together.
4295420	4296420	That guy over there.
4296420	4297420	Yeah, yeah.
4297420	4301420	Can you mark any adjective you think applies to Dan just by looking at him without him
4301420	4302420	saying anything?
4302420	4306420	And after about a hundred of these or so, you start seeing the same patterns, like some
4306420	4308420	of the same words repeat over and over again.
4308420	4311420	I literally did that exercise, and you think, oh, this is horseshit.
4311420	4315420	You take him home and go, it's an international terminal.
4315420	4321420	So a lot of these people are just from Poland, and it's like, why does everyone think I'm
4321420	4324420	sarcastic?
4324420	4326420	Everyone thinks I'm sarcastic.
4326420	4328420	You're standing like 50 feet away.
4328420	4330420	I was just standing there neutral.
4330420	4334420	I check off things that apply to this person, and everybody agrees.
4334420	4338420	I get sarcastic, lazy, smart.
4338420	4339420	That's it.
4339420	4340420	That's all I remember.
4340420	4344420	I'm like, how do you know I'm lazy?
4344420	4345420	And sarcastic.
4345420	4348420	The thing is, they might all be wrong about whether or not you're lazy.
4348420	4350420	You might not be lazy, because you're a workaholic.
4350420	4357420	I don't think of you as a lazy person, but strangers all unanimously agree.
4357420	4358420	Rob does.
4358420	4359420	Who?
4359420	4362420	Makes a lot of comments about it.
4362420	4367420	I went with a guy who looked like Charles Bronson, who was this tough dude with a mustache.
4367420	4372420	I would say, this is back in the days where you could walk into the terminal before a
4372420	4375420	flight, before you had to go through security.
4375420	4379420	You could be at the gates without going through security.
4379420	4381420	So you'd say, see that guy over there?
4381420	4382420	We're in an acting class.
4382420	4384420	Your flight is delayed.
4384420	4388420	If you've got nothing better to do, check off what you think applies to this person,
4388420	4389420	and people love it.
4389420	4391420	Because there's not a lot of shit to do at the airport.
4391420	4397420	Especially, this is before 9-11, and before the massive amount of, this is before Candy
4397420	4398420	Crush.
4398420	4399420	This is before Words With Friends.
4399420	4402420	This is before people had shit to do.
4402420	4405420	I get to pass judgment on a stranger with no consequences.
4405420	4406420	It's hilarious.
4406420	4410420	Also, if you want to write things down, extra things at the bottom, do that too.
4410420	4413420	And the thing is, they all said the same shit.
4413420	4415420	So we got 50.
4415420	4418300	Some Christians have said, do five if you trust me.
4418300	4420420	Do 500 if you don't.
4420420	4423660	The thing is, it's going to be the same information, no matter what.
4423660	4425420	Everyone's going to agree that ...
4425420	4429500	Remember Shrab, we went to the weekend intensive, and you're not supposed to tell anybody what's
4429500	4430500	on your cards?
4430500	4433900	Because then you do an intensive version where your fellow students are writing shit down
4433900	4434900	during exercises.
4434900	4435900	Shrab's all sullen.
4435900	4436900	He's mad.
4436900	4442220	We were walking down the sidewalk out of the thing, and I was like, man, this is fucking
4442220	4443220	great.
4443220	4445660	I just looked at my cards, and you looked at yours, and you're not supposed to talk
4445660	4448300	to each other at lunch about your cards?
4448300	4454220	And Rob's bummed out, and I said, what's going on, man?
4454220	4455220	You're not having a good time?
4455220	4456220	He's like, I don't know, man.
4456220	4458220	And I'm like, wait, what is it?
4458220	4463220	It's like, someone said I look like C-3PO.
4463220	4471100	I'm not C-3PO.
4471100	4476940	He was like, moving his ... I was like, are you doing a bit?
4476940	4477940	Are you doing a bit?
4477940	4478940	I wasn't.
4478940	4479940	No, I'm not.
4479940	4480940	I'm not C-3PO.
4480940	4481940	I wasn't.
4481940	4484380	I only speak five million languages.
4484380	4487300	Okay, so Derek, so in that case ...
4487300	4488300	Hang on.
4488300	4492820	The guy I went to the airport with, this kind of tough Charles Bronson looking dude, we
4492820	4495820	got in the car, and I got teamed up with him.
4495820	4497780	I didn't really want to be this guy's partner.
4497780	4501500	It turned out to be the most informative thing in the world, because we got in the
4501500	4505100	car, and he's looking through the stuff, and he's like ... He's going through his ... Everything's
4505100	4509020	like, why does everybody say suspicious?
4509020	4515300	I'm like, dude, you're a suspect.
4515300	4516620	Like you're suspicious of them?
4516620	4518740	I'm suspicious of you?
4518740	4527260	And also, the same guy actually got up and was like, why do people keep saying I'm loud?
4528260	4533860	And watching other people reject their shit was amazing, but Rob, I had one that made
4533860	4534860	me cry.
4534860	4537300	I was like, oh, that's fucking exactly how you say that thing.
4537300	4539820	And you had one that I loved.
4539820	4546400	It's Last Puppy at the Pound, right?
4546400	4547400	It's amazing.
4547400	4551420	But also, because you root for the Last Puppy at the Pound.
4551420	4552580	He's the cute one.
4552580	4555580	Yeah, and the Last Puppy at the Pound manipulates people's ...
4555580	4560460	What was your breakthrough on, Dan?
4560460	4568820	Well, it was Mud Monster on Shore Leave, because it's like, I'm from the fucking shitty, slimy
4568820	4573900	world, but I'm on vacation.
4573900	4577940	I like clean, soft, frilly ... I like the real world.
4577940	4578940	I love it.
4578940	4580940	I just don't belong in it.
4580940	4582820	So I'm just like, that's fucking awesome.
4582820	4583820	You're so clean.
4584460	4586820	That's why I love Hugh Jackman.
4586820	4587820	We worked with him.
4587820	4588820	I fucking love that guy.
4588820	4594140	That's why I love fucking handsome, pretty things.
4594140	4596900	I love clean, but I'm never going to be.
4596900	4600460	I'm on Shore Leave, but I don't want to hang out.
4600460	4605700	It's like when a LA person goes to Portland, and they keep apologizing for it being overcast.
4605700	4608820	I was like, motherfucker, why do you think I came here?
4608820	4610340	I live in a desert.
4610340	4611980	That's me with mud.
4611980	4613380	I'm a mud monster.
4613380	4614380	On Shore Leave.
4614380	4615660	What was yours, Jared?
4615660	4616660	My main one?
4616660	4620740	My main one was I've been many places, but I've never forgotten where I've come from.
4620740	4623860	So you started lifting weights.
4623860	4624860	What was it?
4624860	4631100	I had a lot of, what was it, I have this gentle tough guy thing working like a Swiss watch,
4631100	4634740	and I had another one where it was like a superhero in search of super heroin for meaningful
4634740	4636820	exchange of superpowers.
4636820	4638380	And so there's a lot of comic book-y type things.
4638380	4640420	I'm like, wait, if I worked out, I could be the same bad guy.
4640420	4644860	You felt like you were like a Dexter in Space Ace, but you weren't Space Ace yet.
4644860	4646860	Oh my God, that's a reference.
4646860	4648860	Applause, never.
4648860	4651900	Yeah, absolutely, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
4651900	4652900	That's amazing.
4652900	4654900	Don Bluth, Laserdisc Game.
4654900	4658340	A Space Ace reference.
4658340	4661540	When did I become the guy that's like, I made a reference?
4661540	4663260	When I just cast on this ice float.
4663260	4666740	Could we apply Sam Christensen knowledge on Spencer and give him an essence?
4666740	4668740	Oh, that's a good one.
4668740	4678340	Spencer's essence is, I am taking over your ship and sailing it into cock harbor.
4678340	4680340	I am a Viking of pussy.
4680340	4682340	It's a great place.
4682340	4684340	No, I don't know.
4684340	4686340	It's a fun place.
4686340	4688340	Let's see, Spencer's essence is...
4688340	4690340	This is weird, right?
4690340	4692340	That's one of them.
4692940	4706940	The thing about this class, it's amazing, Drew Carey, I took it a long time ago, and I told Drew about it, and he goes, and Drew's famous, and we're taking a road trip together, and he's like, I want to know who I am.
4706940	4715940	The whole point is that there's things that people, strangers, friends, instantly agree about you, whether they're right or wrong.
4715940	4721340	They all go, if they looked at you and go, are you, do you like to swim or do you hate getting your hair wet?
4721340	4723340	They would all agree or disagree on that.
4723340	4725340	But it would be unanimous.
4725340	4732340	You might be an Olympic swimmer, but they might go, no, she doesn't like to get her hair wet, because there's an essence about you.
4732340	4734340	I'm just making, off the top of my head.
4734340	4743340	So, it's this thing, you find out, all the things you wish people thought about you, maybe they don't.
4743340	4749340	Also, some things that you wish, I hope people think of this, they do think that.
4749340	4757340	I mean, the big thing is that everything that sticks out about you when you're six years old is the same forever.
4757340	4761340	Well, everyone notices everything that's special about you.
4761340	4764340	It doesn't have to be who you are.
4764340	4766340	It's just like, it's the way you stick out.
4766340	4768340	It's the edges that you have.
4768340	4777340	It doesn't have to be a glamorous, it's not always like, we're raised on myths like the ugly duckling and Rudolph and things where we get that concept that,
4777340	4781340	oh, maybe the thing that you think is ugly will make you beautiful.
4781340	4786340	But that still enforces the idea of utility and beauty.
4786340	4796340	The more important thing to realize is that when you're on the playground, you're differently shaped than everyone around you.
4796340	4802340	And your early experiences with what makes you different are usually negative experiences.
4802340	4812340	Because the people around you, they're practicing being a society, which is like water, which erodes away at rough edges.
4812340	4823340	So all of our early experiences, hearing things about ourselves, are experiences of crowds gathering around us and going, nanny, nanny, panty, panty.
4823340	4826340	I just have something that's like, I'm not a panty panty.
4826340	4828340	And it only means something to us.
4828340	4833340	It's like something that they figured out, they fucking zeroed in on it.
4833340	4836340	And it might even just be the fact that you hate attention.
4836340	4838340	That's for a lot of people.
4838340	4840340	And then they fucking hone in.
4840340	4853340	And a lot of us who are destined for interesting things or just hard things, that's when we have to practice being special, whether we like it or not.
4853340	4856340	And they get to practice being a society, whether they like it or not.
4856340	4867340	And what's amazing is in the class, there was women in my class, young or middle aged women, that they have to find out how the world thinks of them as pretty or beautiful.
4867340	4869340	And there was a couple of gals that were really beautiful.
4869340	4875340	And the way that the world thinks, the way they describe their beauty is really hard for them to hear it.
4875340	4878340	Because they've been tortured by that since they were little girls.
4878340	4885340	And so for them to own the fact, I won't say her name because she's on TV and you all know her.
4885340	4887340	She's one of them isn't she?
4887340	4890340	She was in the class.
4890340	4892340	She's a Latina.
4892340	4896340	Amy Esperanza.
4896340	4899340	Yes, it was Amy Esperanza.
4900340	4907340	People in the class secretly write down ways to describe things about people.
4907340	4910340	And they kept saying hot tamale.
4910340	4912340	She's like, I'm not a hot tamale.
4912340	4916340	No, it is like Sam's like, you're a hot tamale.
4916340	4918340	They're racist, but...
4918340	4921340	She's like, I've heard that since I was a little girl.
4921340	4923340	You're going to hear that till you die.
4923340	4925340	Katherine Hepburn, when she was...
4925340	4927340	How old was she when Philadelphia Story came out?
4927340	4929340	18, 19, very young.
4929340	4932340	All the reviews called her feisty.
4932340	4935340	Everyone said, she's feisty, she's feisty, she's feisty.
4935340	4940340	Then when she's whatever, 70 or whatever, she wasn't on Golden Pond, crusty.
4940340	4944340	When you're older, they call you crusty.
4944340	4947340	What they're talking about is an essence of defiance.
4947340	4951340	When you're a defiant 18-year-old woman, you're feisty.
4951340	4954340	If you're a defiant 70-year-old woman, you're crusty.
4954340	4958340	Flavor becomes like, hey, who poisoned my food?
4958340	4962340	But what they're talking about is, Katherine Hepburn's essence is,
4962340	4964340	she never needed men.
4964340	4967340	It was a complete defiance of masculinity.
4967340	4970340	We have different names for that when you're young and when you're old.
4970340	4973340	Also, one of the things he had us do in that class is,
4973340	4976340	he said, go home, grab your yearbooks.
4976340	4979340	I don't even know if you kids do the yearbook thing anymore.
4980340	4982340	That was the last time anyone was ever going to say shit to you.
4982340	4984340	They would write all this shit in your yearbook.
4984340	4988340	Also, all your love letters, we would pass loose leaf love letters.
4988340	4991340	I would keep them all.
4991340	4994340	Our generation, we'd have boxes of them.
4994340	4999340	He said, go home, grab the notes from the girls in your high school
4999340	5004340	when things were going good when they liked you,
5004340	5009340	and then go all the way through when they have a problem with you
5009340	5013340	and look at the fact that there's just two different words
5013340	5015340	for what makes you who you are.
5015340	5019340	When they're hot for you, you're capricious
5019340	5024340	and when they're dumping you, you're scatterbrained.
5024340	5029340	For me, all my yearbook stuff, there's different neighborhoods of things.
5029340	5032340	There's a way to describe how you're attractive or how you're funny
5032340	5035340	or how you're smart or how you're lonely or how you're weird
5035340	5038340	or how you're fucked up.
5038340	5042340	We have these neighborhoods of these different qualities of ourselves.
5042340	5047340	One of mine is, if you like me, confident, poised.
5047340	5051340	If you don't like me, cocky, arrogant, like a piece of shit.
5051340	5054340	This piece of shit is thrown in.
5054340	5057340	That's like the cheese on the cheese fries.
5057340	5061340	A piece of shit could go on anything.
5061340	5066340	For me, the one that blew my mind, Sam was like,
5066340	5069340	All right, of course.
5069340	5073340	We're trying to figure out, Sam was like, there's a way to describe the fact,
5073340	5077340	because it's not enough to say, Jeff, that you're cocky, because you are cocky.
5077340	5080340	But also, you're not just arrogant.
5080340	5082340	Also, you're not just poised.
5082340	5085340	You're not just self-confident.
5085340	5088340	You also have a huge cock.
5088340	5090340	Thank you for coming to this class.
5091340	5096340	I'm going to write you a check right now for taking this class.
5096340	5099340	He has these books of slang.
5099340	5101340	You go to the OED and all this stuff.
5101340	5103340	You're trying to find the perfect way to word things.
5103340	5106340	He wrote it down, and he goes, Jeff, I think you're going to like this.
5106340	5108340	I don't think anybody else in the world would.
5108340	5110340	I think that you might actually agree with this
5110340	5114340	and like this description of that neighborhood of stuff.
5114340	5117340	He wrote it down in a piece of paper and gave it to me.
5118340	5121340	I hit this desk and started crying.
5121340	5123340	I was like, exactly.
5123340	5126340	It was not conceited, just convinced.
5128340	5130340	I said, yeah, I don't think I'm better than you.
5130340	5132340	I know I am.
5134340	5136340	Only a dick would think he was better than you.
5136340	5138340	I just am.
5138340	5140340	Let's move on.
5140340	5142340	I can be a great guy.
5142340	5145340	You can laugh and go, oh, yeah, I'm a prick.
5146340	5149340	There's a charm to that prickiness, and there's a thing.
5149340	5151340	No, we always circle that because it's like there's some people
5151340	5154340	that turn you off with their confidence because it's like,
5154340	5155340	oh, that dick.
5155340	5157340	Some people rise.
5157340	5159340	They go, somebody strata up that they're like,
5159340	5161340	oh, yeah, I got nothing to worry about,
5161340	5164340	so let me take you out on the dance floor and give you a twirl.
5164340	5167340	Oh, yeah, I'm not battling those dragons,
5167340	5169340	so let me share my wealth with you.
5169340	5172340	There was a girl in my class who is a great actor, Silas,
5172340	5174340	and she's amazing.
5174340	5176340	Again, you would know who she was.
5176340	5178340	She is the one that turned me on in the class.
5178340	5179340	Gina Davis.
5179340	5181340	Gina Davis.
5181340	5183340	Judi Dench.
5185340	5188340	There was one essence that she could never agree on,
5188340	5191340	and we all in the class knew exactly what it was,
5191340	5193340	and it was impossible.
5193340	5195340	And she would never figure out the last one,
5195340	5199340	and we'd all just say to her, you're impossible.
5199340	5202340	And that doesn't mean bad.
5203340	5206340	Impossible is amazing, because there's no pleasing you,
5206340	5209340	but also you're the most important person to try to please.
5209340	5211340	You're just beyond pleasing.
5211340	5214340	Oh, and she ended up marrying Tom Cruise.
5216340	5218340	Judi Dench.
5218340	5221340	There was a girl in our class, and she stormed out,
5221340	5223340	and she goes, hard to handle?
5223340	5224340	She was German.
5224340	5225340	She said, hard to handle?
5225340	5227340	Fuck this class.
5227340	5229340	I'm not C-3PO!
5232340	5234340	Also, Rob, you have a good one that I love.
5234340	5236340	It's Little Green Man.
5236340	5237340	Oh, Little Green Man, yeah.
5237340	5238340	I love that one.
5238340	5239340	Yeah, yeah.
5239340	5240340	Little Green Man was awesome.
5240340	5241340	Because you are from outer space,
5241340	5242340	and you can get it in an awesome way.
5242340	5243340	And that's the C-3PO essence, too.
5243340	5244340	I guess.
5244340	5245340	I guess.
5245340	5247340	Yeah, it's not Boba Fett.
5248340	5253340	Dan, one of yours essence that I love is unspeakable sadness.
5255340	5256340	Right?
5257340	5258340	It's unspeakable.
5258340	5259340	All right.
5259340	5261340	That's why I text you.
5263340	5268340	I try to help you through that sadness without speaking.
5269340	5272340	I know it's uncomfortable, so I text you.
5272340	5275340	And even though you don't text back, I hear you.
5275340	5276340	It's OK.
5276340	5277340	It's OK.
5277340	5280340	I wrote one of the cards from that class that somebody wrote
5280340	5283340	that led to that being one of my essences,
5283340	5285340	which is what you get from this class.
5285340	5290340	And this really, really triggered me.
5290340	5293340	It's weird when you hear the shit that's like,
5293340	5294340	what the fuck?
5296340	5298340	In the class, you do monologue.
5298340	5302340	Sam goes, tell us about an animal that changed your life.
5302340	5303340	Oh, boy.
5303340	5306340	And you'll talk for three minutes.
5306340	5308340	And the other students scribble.
5308340	5310340	He gives the students an exercise.
5310340	5314340	He goes, I want you to compare Dan to a weather phenomenon
5314340	5315340	on your card.
5315340	5317340	He just gives you specific instructions
5317340	5319340	to get you out of your head.
5319340	5322340	And sometimes he goes, free anything, no category.
5322340	5326340	Dan, talk about a celebrity you hate, or whatever.
5326340	5327340	Talk for a while.
5327340	5328340	And then I got my cards.
5328340	5332340	And one of them just said, talk, talk, talk, wounded.
5332340	5333340	Whoa!
5338340	5340340	My favorite, when I went to the airport.
5340340	5342340	Car me no likey.
5342340	5343340	Still gets me.
5343340	5346340	When I went to the airport, there was a bunch of,
5347340	5350340	there's a big like, a bunch of like middle-aged,
5350340	5353340	like maybe like thirties, forties, fifties, black women
5353340	5355340	that were all traveling together as a family.
5355340	5356340	The worst.
5356340	5358340	Oh, I thought that's what you were going.
5358340	5363340	And so, my Charles Bronson guy, like you also asked,
5363340	5365340	like you say, also if you want to just freestyle
5365340	5368340	and write shit on your own at the bottom of it.
5368340	5370340	And somebody wrote, and I love this one.
5370340	5372340	She goes, that white boy crazy.
5373340	5376340	All right.
5376340	5377340	All right.
5377340	5379340	I was just standing there.
5379340	5380340	All right.
5380340	5383340	Well, I mean, yeah.
5383340	5385340	But Spencer, like.
5385340	5386340	That white person.
5386340	5388340	We said, oh, like Drew Carey.
5388340	5390340	Like, so we're in the car.
5390340	5392340	And he's like, I want to know who I am.
5392340	5393340	And he went and took the class.
5393340	5396340	And he was still, the Drew Carey show was still happening.
5396340	5397340	That was crazy.
5397340	5400340	Someone wrote, the price is right.
5401340	5404340	He hadn't.
5404340	5405340	That was his essence.
5405340	5406340	I saw Drew.
5406340	5407340	And then he went to the show.
5407340	5408340	And he was like.
5408340	5409340	I want to go see.
5409340	5410340	I want to go see a great comedy show.
5410340	5411340	And Drew is there.
5411340	5413340	And he goes, thank you.
5413340	5414340	All right.
5414340	5415340	That's a hair.
5415340	5416340	That's a hair trigger.
5416340	5417340	You.
5417340	5418340	That's a.
5418340	5419340	Proof you.
5419340	5421340	Proof you.
5421340	5422340	Proof you.
5426340	5427340	Proof you.
5427340	5428340	Oh.
5429340	5430340	Proof you.
5430340	5432340	This is hilarious.
5432340	5434340	I thought for sure he was doing a bit.
5434340	5435340	But he wasn't.
5435340	5436340	I saw Drew at a gig.
5436340	5437340	And he goes, hey, man.
5437340	5441340	So I just got called by Les Moonves from CBS.
5441340	5446340	And they're offering me to be the new host of Price is Right.
5446340	5447340	I'm like, are you going to do it?
5447340	5450340	And he goes, you know, I guess if the money's good enough.
5450340	5452340	I was like, no.
5452340	5454340	If the price is right.
5459340	5462340	It's like if the money is good enough.
5466340	5467340	If they mean my quote.
5467340	5469340	Come on forward.
5469340	5471340	That was your one chance.
5471340	5475340	That was your one chance.
5475340	5477340	If the money's good enough.
5477340	5482340	I'm like, I like I looked at like, are you fucking with me right now?
5482340	5486340	So Drew went and took the class and he then sent everybody he knew like all the people
5486340	5487340	in the Drew Carey set.
5487340	5490340	He like paid for people to go to take this same Christmas class.
5490340	5492340	You must do it even if you're not an actor.
5492340	5493340	It's really great.
5493340	5494340	Like soft knowledge stuff.
5494340	5498340	It really does liberate you in terms of like agreeing with the fact that the world knows
5498340	5500340	who you are, whether you like it or not.
5500340	5504340	And also there's some stuff that you think you are that you're just fucking not.
5504340	5505340	And like you know, you learn.
5505340	5509340	And there's a lot of stuff that people are always going to think you are and fucking
5509340	5510340	get over it.
5510340	5511340	Yeah.
5511340	5513340	Like people think that I don't like them.
5514340	5517340	And like now at this stage, they're right.
5517340	5525340	But I told Sam, we'd have back in the old days, like you would talk to Sam and he's
5525340	5527340	like, Jeff, he's like, you're a really loyal guy.
5527340	5528340	Like you're loyal to your friends.
5528340	5531340	Like you will stick with your friends no matter what.
5531340	5532340	You're a loyal person.
5532340	5534340	He goes, but that's not one of your essences.
5534340	5536340	You don't walk in a room and go, oh, this dude's true blue.
5536340	5538340	Like he will always stick with me.
5538340	5540340	You don't walk in the room looking like that.
5540340	5542340	That's something that you know after meeting you.
5542340	5544340	But that's not an essence of yours.
5544340	5546340	So get over that one.
5546340	5547340	So Drew went.
5547340	5551340	And what I love about Drew, one of his was and one that really set Drew Carey free,
5551340	5552340	which is amazing.
5552340	5553340	And he was so happy to learn this.
5553340	5559340	One of his essences is, I'm doing the best I can with what I've got.
5559340	5562340	And he's like, I'm a millionaire.
5565340	5568340	But I'm just still trying the best I can.
5568340	5569340	That's exactly who he is.
5569340	5570340	You can say that.
5570340	5574340	That's a phrase you can say when you want to do an impression of Drew Carey.
5574340	5577340	I'm doing the best I can with what I've got.
5577340	5580340	Drew, he's like, am I allowed to know that about myself?
5580340	5582340	He's like, look at what I have.
5582340	5584340	Like I can't say that.
5584340	5586340	He said, no, it doesn't matter what you think.
5586340	5587340	All right, Derek Mears.
5587340	5588340	Oh, sorry.
5588340	5590340	I'm done.
5590340	5592340	See, I'm bad at this.
5592340	5595340	Talk, talk, talk wounded.
5600340	5610340	So, Derek, you're a muscle man.
5610340	5613340	Are you going to hit me like my dad?
5620340	5627340	When you're physically fit, all I've ever known is I look in the mirror and I go,
5628340	5630340	all right, that's a sea otter.
5630340	5631340	That's a baby.
5631340	5633340	Like, and that's how I came out of the womb.
5633340	5635340	And I've never done any exercise.
5635340	5637340	And I'm like, still look like a baby.
5637340	5640340	And then I'm like, if I start to look like a fat baby, then I'm like,
5640340	5641340	man, I got to figure something out.
5641340	5644340	And then I'm like, okay, I look like a baby again.
5644340	5647340	But then other people are like,
5648340	5651340	and then they look like GI Joe.
5653340	5654340	Don't.
5657340	5663340	Oh, black ops.
5663340	5665340	I got to go.
5669340	5671340	Is that your ringtone?
5673340	5676340	When you have to do wet work, it's like, it's not what you think.
5676340	5677340	It's not discrete.
5677340	5679340	It's like, it's the whole room.
5679340	5680340	You're in an opera house.
5680340	5684340	I was like, and then it's like, and the opera singer was like,
5685340	5689340	he's checking his phone and you're like, hiding in plain sight.
5689340	5692340	And you break everyone's neck in the opera house.
5694340	5698340	Or just in your row, go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.
5705340	5712340	This is like, when you're fit, when you're made of muscle,
5713340	5719340	when you look good, when you're a hot piece of action.
5726340	5728340	I'm so being judged by everybody right now.
5728340	5730340	They're like, man, I don't know.
5730340	5732340	The band's talking a little much.
5737340	5741340	We're all going to have to be 80 if we're lucky.
5742340	5745340	What's my go-to once my body falls apart?
5745340	5746340	Yeah.
5746340	5749340	Is there a day that you stop?
5749340	5751340	And then are you terrified of that?
5751340	5752340	Oh, shit.
5752340	5755340	Now if I fucking skip Monday.
5755340	5759340	No, honestly, a lot of the training and whatnot is for my job.
5759340	5761340	My job is to tell stories.
5761340	5762340	I love stories.
5762340	5765340	And I told my mom when I was younger, I don't need to be rich or famous.
5765340	5767340	I want to play with my friends and just make a living.
5767340	5769340	And it's been amazing.
5771340	5772340	No, no, don't.
5772340	5773340	No.
5773340	5774340	No.
5774340	5778340	When you get up to discipline for writing and whatnot, you work on writing.
5778340	5780340	I work on, I know what sells.
5780340	5783340	But my backup plan also have a brain.
5783340	5785340	So create things and do stuff.
5785340	5786340	Yeah, OK.
5786340	5787340	Now I feel like a dick.
5787340	5788340	Oh, no, no, no.
5788340	5789340	I wasn't trying to be that way.
5789340	5792340	No, because I'm just wondering, because every day I look in the mirror,
5792340	5793340	I try not to.
5793340	5795340	I try as hard as I can not to.
5795340	5798340	But I look in the mirror and I'm like, OK, like an A cup, B cup,
5798340	5799340	getting a B cup.
5799340	5801340	I make these judgments.
5801340	5803340	We all look at our bodies and we go like, ah, fuck.
5803340	5808340	And then there's these people who like fucking like,
5808340	5809340	what do you mean these people?
5809340	5810340	I mean you.
5810340	5813340	You have a regimen.
5813340	5815340	Shrabs, one of them too.
5815340	5820340	You guys, you're in the zone.
5820340	5821340	You're healthy.
5821340	5825340	And so then you look in the mirror and then I'm just wondering,
5826340	5833340	isn't there a dust bowl behind you?
5833340	5835340	How does the human body work?
5835340	5836340	I don't know.
5836340	5837340	How does that work?
5837340	5841340	Do you have to be, when you go to the gym,
5841340	5848340	are there 70-year-old dudes that are just keeping it up?
5848340	5850340	Is it that whole use it or lose it mentality?
5850340	5852340	But also after you get past a certain age,
5852340	5855340	your growth hormone stuff's producing as much as it used to.
5855340	5858340	And so your body starts to die, basically,
5858340	5861340	where it starts to not being as spry and agile as it used to be.
5861340	5864340	But if you just keep that, I always call that spoonful of sugar
5864340	5867340	where it's like, oh man, if I do this, I'll feel good
5867340	5870340	and I can do what else I want to do during the day.
5870340	5872340	And also it helps me with my job to sell what my product is,
5872340	5874340	is being that big bad guy.
5874340	5876340	I meet people left and right going, oh my God,
5876340	5878340	I saw you in this or that and you're a murderer
5878340	5879340	and you scared the crap out of me.
5879340	5881340	But I meet you in person, you're a human being.
5881340	5883340	I'm like, yeah, we all have skills in my life philosophy.
5883340	5885340	It's like, we all have skills in different areas.
5885340	5886340	No one's better than anybody else.
5886340	5888340	Do what you love and try to move forward.
5888340	5894340	What age does your body die?
5894340	5896340	What age is it?
5896340	5897340	We need to know.
5897340	5902340	It's usually like from 44 things start to decline.
5902340	5909340	Okay, so I'm 43, so I can eat Pringles for breakfast for another year
5909340	5912340	and then just start working out and then eat.
5912340	5917340	No, the awesome thing for that is like my...
5917340	5921340	I gotta go kill myself.
5921340	5923340	No, it's kind of like if you...
5923340	5925340	Oh no.
5925340	5926340	What? Okay.
5926340	5929340	I thought Dave was joining him.
5929340	5930340	That's awesome.
5930340	5933340	No, like...
5933340	5936340	What?
5936340	5938340	Rob is now for the home audience,
5938340	5941340	pretending to murder himself behind glass.
5941340	5948340	Rob killed himself with a gun loaded with stolen focus.
5948340	5954340	It's something prisoners use when they're deprived of...
5954340	5956340	No, as long as you keep using your muscle.
5956340	5960340	I mean, muscles in general, like with you with writing that you use in your brain,
5960340	5964340	whatever you use, it'll stay active, in my opinion, I hope.
5965340	5968340	Yeah, I'm trying to think of just the most crass way to phrase the thing.
5968340	5969340	Say it.
5969340	5971340	We're friends.
5971340	5975340	Obviously, if I keep doing what I'm doing,
5975340	5980340	I'm gonna die sooner and look worse the whole time
5980340	5982340	and I'll never...
5982340	5987340	The longer I wait, the harder it will be for me to start just being healthy.
5987340	5989340	And I'm just wondering on the other...
5989340	5991340	There's this other railroad track where I see you,
5991340	5993340	one of my friends that I've known for decades,
5993340	5995340	I'm going like, hey, and I'm just wondering,
5995340	5997340	what does your railroad track look like?
5997340	5999340	What are the hazards?
5999340	6001340	What are you worried about?
6001340	6004340	Do fit people...
6004340	6009340	Is there ever a point where the tool starts using you?
6009340	6011340	Is there ever...
6011340	6016340	I think shamelessly I kind of, I guess, want to hear,
6016340	6019340	oh yeah, it's the worst.
6019340	6022340	There it is. I don't want to do it.
6022340	6023340	But it's also my job.
6023340	6025340	So I have to, if I'm not working somewhere,
6025340	6028340	I gotta go, okay, clock into the gym and train.
6028340	6031340	But you have to stay up on anything in life.
6031340	6033340	Is that what you're getting at?
6033340	6034340	I'm not sure what I'm getting at.
6034340	6039340	Part of it is this Midwestern thing of the principal
6039340	6041340	was always a former wrestling coach
6041340	6044340	and then he'd have this big giant gut.
6044340	6045340	Oh, I see what you're saying.
6045340	6047340	And then the kids would whisper to each other and go,
6047340	6049340	dude, that was all muscle.
6049340	6051340	And muscle turns to fat if you stop using it.
6051340	6055340	So you're saying how people identify with things.
6055340	6057340	They identify, that's who I am.
6057340	6058340	I'm the guy who's big.
6058340	6059340	No, no, no, no, no.
6059340	6060340	I'm talking physiologically.
6060340	6062340	I'm talking about what is the...
6062340	6064340	I'm actually talking purely physiologically,
6064340	6067340	not what we should, where our value system should be.
6067340	6068340	Gotcha.
6068340	6070340	I'm talking about actually, how does that shit work?
6070340	6073340	If you're fucking, if you look awesome
6073340	6077340	and are doing, putting all that work into it,
6077340	6082340	is there a fucking, is there an anxiety to that
6082340	6086340	that sets in where it's like, oh shit,
6086340	6089340	now I look so awesome that,
6089340	6093340	now I'll look like Dan Harmon if I stop tomorrow.
6093340	6095340	I don't know what I'm trying to add.
6095340	6097340	If you're really muscle bound, you have to be careful.
6097340	6100340	At some point, that muscle can turn to fat
6100340	6104340	or can turn to that big ex-football coach belly
6104340	6106340	that's really hard, like a watermelon, that kind of stuff.
6106340	6109340	Is that just something fat people say to make themselves feel better?
6109340	6113340	Or is that idea that muscle turns to fat kind of thing?
6113340	6114340	It does.
6114340	6116340	I checked before and you don't use it.
6116340	6117340	Fat.
6117340	6119340	But you'll definitely lose it.
6119340	6120340	Spencer, do you exercise at all?
6120340	6121340	No.
6121340	6122340	Not a bit?
6122340	6123340	Nothing?
6123340	6124340	No, of course not.
6124340	6127340	You seem like, since I've known you,
6127340	6129340	which is now what, three, four years?
6129340	6130340	How long?
6130340	6132340	Three, four years.
6132340	6136340	You maintain a certain steady physique.
6136340	6138340	You don't fluctuate.
6138340	6140340	I gain weight.
6140340	6141340	Yes, you can do it.
6141340	6142340	I fluctuate.
6142340	6149340	I think for me, if I ate what I wanted to,
6149340	6152340	my favorite thing in the world is a 4 a.m. burrito.
6152340	6153340	It's the greatest thing in the world.
6153340	6157340	Just eat a bunch of bullshit after you drink all night long.
6157340	6158340	But he's vegetarian.
6158340	6160340	He means...
6160340	6162340	No, go to Benito's Tacos and eat it.
6162340	6164340	Just a shit-ass burrito.
6164340	6167340	Until I turned 30, I could never gain a pound.
6167340	6168340	Then one day, I looked at him, I was like,
6168340	6170340	oh, fuck, I got a big-ass belly.
6170340	6173340	I look like Sinor Cartgauge from Homestar Runner.
6173340	6176340	Look good.
6176340	6178340	Tall and skinny with a giant belly.
6178340	6179340	I'm like, this is fucking...
6179340	6181340	I have to curb that shit.
6181340	6183340	Here's your secret.
6183340	6185340	But you won't do this because you're not vain like I am.
6185340	6189340	Buy suits that you love, and if you can't fit in them,
6189340	6191340	stop it.
6191340	6192340	Stop doing what you're doing.
6192340	6194340	Get back in the suits.
6194340	6197340	Don't let them out like fucking...
6197340	6201340	I buy suits that I fit into, and if I can't fit in them,
6201340	6204340	then exercise and diet, get it back on track.
6204340	6206340	That's visualizing your goals and where you want to be.
6206340	6207340	Precisely, Spencer.
6207340	6210340	Makes it concrete and more attainable that way.
6210340	6212340	Also, as you get older, I got to say it,
6212340	6214340	sounds dumb, yoga.
6214340	6216340	Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.
6216340	6221340	Because you need flexibility and agility in your joints
6221340	6222340	and stuff like that.
6222340	6225340	When you do that stuff, you can spring up and down staircases
6225340	6227340	like a gazelle.
6227340	6230340	But otherwise, your joints are creaking like an old...
6230340	6231340	It's like a ratchet strap.
6231340	6234340	If your whole life you're not even working out
6234340	6235340	and just doing normal activity,
6235340	6236340	everything is cranked and cranked.
6236340	6237340	Every time you engage that muscle,
6237340	6239340	and if you don't undo that,
6239340	6242340	you start to be that old person hunch and whatnot.
6242340	6244340	It's not good for the body. It hurts.
6244340	6245340	Damn it.
6246340	6248340	Oh, man.
6248340	6251340	But this is opening my eyes to something.
6251340	6253340	What's with yoga pants?
6253340	6256340	That seems like a recent thing and it's like...
6256340	6258340	I question it.
6258340	6260340	No, I don't.
6260340	6263340	I think I support yoga pants in every possible way.
6263340	6265340	When did that come about?
6265340	6268340	That seems to be...
6268340	6270340	Because I keep hearing conflicting reports.
6270340	6274340	I think Lou Lemon came along and made everybody wear yoga pants.
6275340	6277340	Yeah, I asked my girlfriend...
6277340	6278340	That's what it is.
6278340	6284340	It's like money flooded into an area of fashion slash exercise.
6284340	6288340	And so this new form of pants was developed.
6288340	6289340	Because I never...
6289340	6290340	I'm like, wait a minute.
6290340	6291340	What?
6291340	6292340	There's pants that...
6292340	6293340	They...
6293340	6294340	Like, yoga pants, they...
6294340	6295340	Stretch.
6295340	6296340	They...
6296340	6297340	It looks like stockings.
6297340	6298340	Like panties.
6298340	6299340	Well, no, they...
6299340	6302340	Also, they make your ass look good.
6302340	6303340	Right?
6303340	6305340	But they're also comfortable.
6305340	6309340	So previously there was a dichotomy of things that made you look good versus things that
6309340	6310340	were comfortable.
6310340	6312340	But this is a thing that's comfortable that makes your ass look really good.
6312340	6314340	It's like a perfect storm.
6314340	6317340	Why didn't they...
6317340	6319340	What technology did they...
6319340	6323340	What did they find out in space that led them to...
6323340	6324340	Houston, we found?
6324340	6325340	A stitch that...
6325340	6326340	I don't know.
6326340	6328340	Have you tried stretch jeans yet for men?
6328340	6330340	No, I'm not making a joke.
6330340	6331340	I swear to God.
6332340	6337340	I shot this thing in Europe and I tried these pants and I went, oh my God, wait, these are
6337340	6338340	stretch...
6338340	6340340	They're like yoga pants, but I'm wearing some right now.
6340340	6341340	Like, checkings?
6341340	6342340	No, like these stretch.
6342340	6343340	They're new levi's, but they're super flexible.
6343340	6344340	Oh, that's why you were able to...
6344340	6347340	That's why I'm not killing my balls trying to kick the ceiling.
6347340	6348340	I was like...
6348340	6349340	Because those look like regular jeans.
6349340	6350340	They're not.
6350340	6351340	They're flexed.
6351340	6352340	They're like four-way flex.
6352340	6353340	All right.
6353340	6354340	Super comfy.
6354340	6357340	Well, I don't know what else we could possibly cover.
6357340	6359340	Let's do a Q&A.
6360340	6367340	Who's got a question for either a lifelong cinematic stuntman slash monster slash...
6367340	6368340	Actor.
6368340	6373340	...a goon actor in the background slash thespian...
6373340	6374340	Goon actor?
6374340	6375340	A goon actor?
6375340	6376340	Yeah, I'm with you, Jeff.
6376340	6377340	Well, what...
6377340	6378340	Okay.
6378340	6379340	It's like...
6379340	6380340	All right.
6383340	6384340	Dave.
6384340	6385340	Dave Kline has a question.
6385340	6388340	I believe in the guy goon actor.
6389340	6392340	Who prints theory of masculine identity?
6392340	6399340	And when you said goon, I think that everyone has a guy who's kind of a tough guy.
6399340	6402340	A goon who's kind of a fuck-up weirdo.
6402340	6405340	And a prince who's like a piece of royalty.
6405340	6407340	And you got all those pieces in you.
6407340	6410340	He said you got a little bit of goon.
6410340	6413340	What's your guy part and what's your prince part?
6416340	6417340	All right.
6417340	6425340	My guy part, the macho side of background and not professionally but fighting, MMA and whatnot,
6425340	6427340	and training martial arts for a long time.
6427340	6430340	My prince part is I try to be...
6430340	6434340	That philosophy to be good to everybody and also whatever people are.
6434340	6436340	I go and do horror cons.
6436340	6438340	I do autograph signings for different fans here and there.
6438340	6441340	And what I love to do, it bumps me out on the social media.
6441340	6445340	I'll see so often people aren't happy with how they look or how they feel about themselves.
6445340	6448340	And I try to empower people going like, man, I grew...
6448340	6449340	I was a different kid, man.
6449340	6450340	I had no hair.
6450340	6451340	I was either...
6451340	6456340	People thought I either had cancer or I was a skinhead growing up when it wasn't cool to be bald and white.
6456340	6458340	People were, oh, that guy's totally white power.
6458340	6459340	No, smart guy.
6459340	6460340	I'm not...
6460340	6463340	But growing up being different and kind of being like a monster.
6463340	6464340	It's coming back, though.
6464340	6465340	It's coming back.
6465340	6466340	Well, I just randomly...
6466340	6468340	Oh, yeah, we haven't talked about that yet.
6468340	6472340	But coming back, I mean, being an adult now and...
6472340	6473340	Look at the point I was trying to make.
6473340	6476340	The point was just trying to empower people to go...
6476340	6479340	Whatever it is that makes you different, step on that gas pedal.
6479340	6483340	Like, no one is like you and love yourself for who you are.
6483340	6485340	And so I love meeting some of these other guys who are like...
6485340	6488340	They see some of my roles as being super tough.
6488340	6489340	Oh, man, I can't wait.
6489340	6490340	I've been so much fun.
6490340	6492340	I love to go to bar fights and smash people in the face.
6492340	6496340	I'm like, man, right now you're wearing a mask of insecurity because you're trying to be macho.
6496340	6497340	There's no reason for that.
6497340	6498340	We're all human beings.
6498340	6501340	Like, express how you feel and move on.
6502340	6503340	The best.
6508340	6509340	I meant goon.
6509340	6511340	Like, because there's a villain.
6511340	6514340	There's goons behind them.
6514340	6520340	So you're either a monster or a guy flying out a window on fire or a goon behind somebody.
6520340	6521340	Anybody have a...
6521340	6522340	He hasn't played Othello yet.
6522340	6523340	Anybody have a question?
6523340	6525340	It could be a Spencer question.
6525340	6526340	It could be a Rob question.
6526340	6527340	He doesn't have to be a Spencer question.
6527340	6529340	What's going on?
6530340	6531340	We're broken down to Q&A.
6531340	6532340	What did you do?
6532340	6533340	What did you go through?
6533340	6534340	What?
6534340	6535340	Did you just take a huge shit?
6535340	6536340	That couldn't have been a P.
6536340	6538340	No, I didn't go to the bathroom and answer some emails.
6538340	6540340	He sent some emails.
6540340	6541340	Answer some emails.
6541340	6543340	No, he answered some emails.
6543340	6544340	You're in a show.
6544340	6545340	All right.
6545340	6546340	All right.
6546340	6547340	Q&A.
6547340	6548340	All right, sir.
6548340	6549340	I've got a question for Derek.
6549340	6550340	Derek.
6550340	6555340	I know that you've been talking about Sense of Self and Essence and you've been playing
6555340	6558340	the bad guy, but do you ever have the...
6558340	6563340	Not ego part of you, but just you really want that leading role kind of deal?
6563340	6564340	Where you...
6564340	6565340	Not Jason.
6565340	6566340	Where you go, Matt.
6566340	6567340	Yeah.
6567340	6568340	Show yourself.
6568340	6570340	I should repeat that and then the next time I'll do...
6570340	6576340	He said, do you ever crave playing the lead role?
6576340	6578340	There you go.
6578340	6581340	Probably missed some of the nuance.
6581340	6582340	I've been lucky.
6582340	6587340	I've done like 85 different film and TV projects, but my mentality is bouncing back because
6587340	6591340	I've been to my normal face and doing monsters.
6591340	6592340	People sometimes...
6592340	6594340	A tangent of your question are like, does that bother you?
6594340	6597340	Because some of you are like, when you play Predator or whatnot, that you look...
6597340	6598340	We can't tell that it's you.
6598340	6599340	Oh, shit.
6599340	6601340	He was classic Predator in the Predators.
6601340	6605340	He wasn't one of those bullshit Predators.
6605340	6608340	He was like old school Predator.
6608340	6611340	He's like, hey, little boy.
6611340	6614340	Want some candy?
6614340	6616340	Want some candy?
6616340	6618340	Want some candy, boy.
6618340	6624340	But to answer your question, as an artist, any other artist, you want to always outdo
6624340	6626340	yourself and do better and better.
6626340	6629340	When I get asked that question, does it bother you when your face is covered up for some
6629340	6633340	of your bigger roles, I'm not bothered by that at all because my job is to tell a story
6633340	6637340	and to service that story and don't remember me, remember the characters.
6637340	6650340	When you watch Hansel and Gretel, which by the way, B+, the Hansel and Gretel movie,
6650340	6653340	have you seen it?
6653340	6656340	It's a real goon movie.
6656340	6663340	That's going to bounce off on me because I'm picked on too.
6663340	6670340	When you watch that movie, do you have PTSD?
6670340	6678340	Funny that you bring this up because a fan just sent me a thing because AMC just played
6678340	6682340	it for the first time and they showed some of the interviews behind the scenes and they
6682340	6686340	had a whole segment of me talking about the Edward character.
6686340	6689340	Literally, I'm watching it because of my arm.
6689340	6693340	I said I got up between my five and six at a herniated disc and my whole arm atrophied
6693340	6695340	and it took about a year to heal.
6695340	6699340	I'm going to these German doctors and they're giving me multiple spinal injections throughout
6699340	6700340	the week.
6700340	6702340	You're shooting overseas and you're like, oh my God, my freaking body is ...
6702340	6703340	Yeah, I can't move.
6703340	6704340	Yeah, yeah.
6704340	6708340	Then you're at the mercy of what might be the better medicine or worse medicine you don't
6708340	6709340	know.
6709340	6710340	Yeah, it was weird.
6710340	6715340	Also, the doctor's name translated to Dr. Creepy or Dr. Sneaky.
6715340	6718340	I was in tears going, are you kidding me?
6718340	6723340	Also, if they lay you down, I'm getting an injection like this is Dr. Frankenstein land.
6723340	6729340	Everybody's talking in German so that little bit of Germans and experiments.
6729340	6734340	I'm laying there and they're like, let it go.
6734340	6737340	They're like, can you take off this part of your clothes?
6737340	6741340	There's a hot nurse there also, a blonde German again.
6741340	6746340	They would go like, oh, so Derek's, what, oh, Andrew.
6746340	6749340	Okay, here it comes.
6749340	6751340	He would say weird things.
6751340	6753340	I had no idea what the fuck he was saying.
6753340	6759340	Then he was like, one, two, three.
6759340	6760340	Christ, the fuck.
6760340	6764340	Yeah, but anyway, to answer your question, yeah, PTSD.
6764340	6766340	I'm watching it and start cracking my neck.
6766340	6767340	I'm like, oh.
6767340	6769340	You're not like Jeremy Renner's hot.
6769340	6771340	You're like, holy shit.
6771340	6777340	You actually like remember like fucking, like when you're watching the, are there,
6777340	6781340	there must be, I can't believe that fucking character is not CG,
6781340	6786340	which is the must be the worst part is that it's like, that means that it could have been.
6786340	6792340	Are there moments when the character is like emoting and like doing a thing and you're like,
6792340	6794340	that was 50 takes.
6794340	6795340	Yeah, absolutely.
6795340	6798340	It's tough because also as an actor, you have like what you want to do for the scene.
6798340	6802340	You've made the characters and spectral motion who made this incredible piece of machinery.
6802340	6806340	I feel like a jet fighter pilot where I get to where I fly this amazing thing.
6806340	6809340	You have to prethink what's going on and communicate going,
6809340	6810340	this is what's going on the scene.
6810340	6811340	This is my arc in the scene.
6811340	6812340	Here's the emotion.
6812340	6813340	That's what's happening.
6813340	6815340	And you have to map out because I couldn't control my hands
6815340	6818340	and I couldn't control my mouth because you saw the mouth,
6818340	6821340	but you can't walk around the character of the mouth open the whole time.
6821340	6822340	So they close it.
6822340	6824340	And so as you're just sitting there and cook,
6824340	6826340	literally cooking, you're breathing your own carbon dioxide.
6826340	6830340	So you're not getting fresh air to fuel your muscles in your brain.
6830340	6834340	And there are times where I'm just like half conscious.
6834340	6835340	Yeah.
6835340	6838340	Like I would like just like lay on the ground and like Renner would come over like,
6838340	6842340	hey man, do you need some water or something right now?
6842340	6843340	It's cool.
6843340	6844340	All right.
6844340	6845340	Just like everyone had that.
6845340	6849340	Do you need some water or something?
6849340	6851340	Hey man, it's me, Jeremy Renner.
6851340	6853340	You need some water.
6853340	6854340	Oh God.
6854340	6855340	Oh man.
6855340	6856340	I hate this dick.
6856340	6858340	Just get some water over here.
6858340	6859340	Oh man.
6859340	6860340	It's such a...
6860340	6861340	This goom, this goom man.
6861340	6862340	He's all goom.
6862340	6866340	I hate it when Jeremy Renner does his weird barrio accent.
6866340	6867340	Oh man.
6867340	6872340	Get this man some water because he's all milked and he's breathing his own carbon dioxide.
6872340	6878340	It's because Jeremy Renner auditioned for that part and got the part of Hansel and was offended.
6878340	6879340	Breathe in his door.
6879340	6881340	And he was like, I can't operate the whole thing.
6881340	6884340	Looking through your own mouth.
6884340	6887340	Breathing your own carbon dioxide.
6887340	6892340	Oh, it's me, Jeremy Renner.
6892340	6895340	Do you need some water, man?
6895340	6899340	Breathing on your own carbon dioxide.
6899340	6902340	Looking through your own mouth.
6902340	6906340	With your disc herinating on the herinating disc.
6906340	6907340	It's good.
6907340	6910340	Can we do a quick commercial for Jeremy Renner's
6910340	6913340	New Mexican Restaurant?
6923340	6926340	Hey, I'm Jeremy Renner.
6926340	6932340	Come on down to Jeremy Renner's taco hut, man.
6932340	6934340	We got Derek Mears here.
6934340	6936340	Star of Hansel and Gretel.
6936340	6938340	He played that goblin thing.
6938340	6942340	He's breathing out of his own oxygen.
6942340	6944340	We got plenty.
6944340	6948340	We got so much water here, man.
6948340	6951340	We got fajitas.
6951340	6956340	We got some gluten-free options for you people.
6956340	6961340	And everybody gets a free tablecloth.
6961340	6963340	So come on down with the kids.
6963340	6967340	Meet the troll man from Hansel and Gretel.
6967340	6968340	That wasn't CG.
6968340	6971340	He was a man in a costume.
6971340	6974340	And just tell him, Jeremy Renner sent you.
6974340	6977340	You get a free pitcher of water.
6977340	6981340	And you can breathe and look through your own mouth.
6981340	6983340	That's Herman's Hansel and Gretel.
6983340	6985340	That's the worst restaurant.
6985340	6989340	That's it for Rob's job.
6989340	6990340	Spencer Cretenden.
6990340	6991340	I'm Jeff Davis.
6991340	6992340	Terrible restaurant.
6992340	6996340	Again, let's hear it for Jordie White making all of our music.
6997340	7003340	Derek Mears, everybody.
7003340	7004340	Your mayor, Dan Harmon.
7004340	7006340	Thank you so much.
