0	20000	Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!
20000	25000	Ahhhhhhhh! Ladies and gentlemen, I'm in town and it's now in session!
26000	31000	Welcome to a beautiful uptown Burbank!
31000	36000	Ladies and gentlemen, I am Rob Strava and I'm going to be filling in for Jeff Davis.
36000	38000	Come Troy! Thank you!
41000	45000	Let's bring up Spencer Crichton!
45000	55000	And the Mayor of Harmon found himself!
55000	58000	Mr. Dan Harmon!
61000	63000	Thank you.
66000	69000	Oh man, I totally crashed after that.
69000	72000	Oh yeah, you're all out of energy now?
73000	75000	Oh shit, I'm fucking old.
75000	77000	You really pumped him up. You warmed him up.
77000	81000	Hey, I was talking to Cody about this.
81000	84000	I was talking to her about masturbation.
84000	85000	Okay.
85000	95000	And I was telling her about a trick that you told me you used when you would walk home from school.
95000	99000	I've done this like 18 times on many different podcasts.
99000	101000	Did you talk about it on this one?
101000	104000	I probably did, but we could do it again.
104000	106000	The fake arm?
106000	111000	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I was a da Vinci of jerking off.
111000	116000	I had like, well we had like the parkas, you know?
116000	123000	So it's like winter and you're walking home and you know, you're in eighth grade so everything makes you horny
123000	126000	and you just want to jerk off and you can't wait till you get home.
126000	134000	So I would slip my hand out of my sleeve and have like the empty sleeve in my pocket
134000	145000	and my hand on my pants and was jerking off as I was walking home because I couldn't wait 10 minutes.
145000	152000	And Cody said, why not just use the bathroom at the school?
152000	154000	Oh yeah, I did that too.
155000	160000	Yeah, I was trying to explain to her like, don't you know that there's not a bathroom on the way home?
160000	162000	There's sidewalk.
162000	165000	Yeah, I mean I would run home.
165000	173000	One day, fifth grade, like just bing and then I thought I invented it and then I just stopped hanging out
173000	180000	and I would just run, I would sprint home and everybody would be like, hey Dan, I'd run home
180000	186000	and I'd just like rip off all my clothes and hump every pillow in the house looking at Penny from Inspector Gadget.
186000	189000	Did you think you were?
189000	192000	I was her age.
192000	194000	It was romantic.
194000	196000	It was like remains of the day.
196000	198000	Did you think like?
198000	204000	We grew up together in a society that kept us apart.
204000	207000	I used to think, I have a feeling you were probably the same way.
207000	212000	I used to feel like, man, I am so good at jerking off.
212000	215000	Like nobody knows I'm doing it.
215000	221000	I could be in the, I go to the, no but I'm so smooth, I've got it all figured out.
221000	223000	And then you get to be an adult.
223000	227000	No, everybody knew you were jerking off constantly.
227000	230000	They just didn't want to go stop.
230000	234000	Yeah, no one wants to acknowledge, no one wants to say, I know what you're doing.
234000	238000	But I've talked about this on the podcast.
238000	244000	I had an unusual, the only reason I didn't use the arm trick, which I did as an adult by the way.
244000	251000	I remember you telling me about doing it walking home and I was in my car and I was like, I'm out of control.
251000	257000	I've got to do something and it's rush hour and I made a little fake arm and I tried jerking off of the car.
257000	258000	You tried?
258000	260000	In the middle of Los Angeles traffic.
260000	264000	I can't even remember if I succeeded or if, I really can't remember.
264000	267000	But, and then Cody's like, why wouldn't you just pull over?
267000	272000	And I'm like, why don't you pull over and you're just like, here's breadth away from a sex offender.
272000	275000	Like you're, and then she told me this story.
275000	276000	She's like, you're right.
276000	282000	I, she was walking and it was probably, there's probably women in the audience right here that this has happened to.
282000	283000	It's all too common.
283000	287000	She was walking and some guy said, hey, come here.
287000	296000	And he was like in his car, like with the window down and she went over like, and he had his dick in his hand and he was like wrenching at it.
296000	298000	And, and she was like, ah, what?
298000	299000	Fuck you.
299000	300000	You piece of shit.
300000	301000	God damn it.
301000	303000	And I'm like, he, then he just drove off.
303000	306000	And I, I just, does he do that all, all night?
306000	308000	And then like, does he eventually come?
308000	310000	Like the next block down.
310000	311000	Excuse me.
311000	312000	You.
312000	316000	Well, I mean, obviously he's getting that he, he's not so, he's not trolling for it.
316000	319000	He's trolling for someone who's like into it.
319000	327000	He, he probably knows that the person's going to go gross, stop it, police.
327000	332000	And that's the only thing that can get them going, which makes me feel a little bad for them.
332000	335000	Smallest violin.
335000	349000	But, you know, when you're, when your kinks involve social tab, just societal taboos, like I do, I do feel bad for those people because I'm sure if they could flip a switch, they'd change it.
349000	350000	Yeah.
350000	351000	I'm sure they would.
351000	355000	There are some issues.
355000	363000	But anyways, as I explained to you and explain to them, like I went for part of my childhood, like I can't remember where, when I was finally just like, what are you doing?
363000	366000	Just use your hand like a fucking person.
366000	369000	I, I had this hang up about masturbation.
369000	376000	So I had myself convinced that what I was doing when I was masturbating was not masturbation because I was humping things.
376000	380000	So then I was, and I remember like being like, I don't know, 11.
380000	389000	And, and I was, and I was sleeping in the same.
389000	392000	I was sleeping in the same living room as my uncle, my dad.
392000	395000	We were at my grandma's cottage.
395000	396000	That makes it sound so fancy.
396000	398000	I think.
398000	402000	Not the word I would have picked.
402000	404000	My grandma had this cottage.
404000	405000	She was sleeping in her room.
405000	407000	My dad was sleeping in the only other room.
407000	408000	So I was sharing the living room with my uncle.
408000	409000	I had a cot.
409000	410000	I was 11.
410000	417000	I had just, I was, I was at the peak of my, you know, I, I, I was into two things.
417000	420000	Ender's game and humping stuff.
421000	424000	And I was all done with Ender's game.
424000	428000	That'd be a good double feature though.
428000	431000	I'm here to read Ender's game and hump stuff.
431000	435000	And Ender's game is a short book.
435000	439000	But I, I, I, so I just started like, I'm just like humping the cot.
439000	440000	It's like, it's just quiet.
440000	441000	We're in the country.
441000	445000	There's crickets and then there's just this squeaking cot.
445000	449000	And I'm just like, I just, I can't, I can only remember it, you know?
449000	452000	Like I can't even relate to it as an adult talking about it.
452000	455000	Like, and obviously we can't talk to an 11 year old about it.
455000	459000	But I just, you know, some of you were 11 year old boys.
459000	466000	And you remember kind of vaguely how it was just, it was, it must have just been because you're so small
466000	469000	and the hormones are so new and you're just, they make up 90% of your bloodstream
469000	471000	and you're just like a paneling nail.
471000	472000	You're just everywhere you go.
472000	474000	You're just, you're just nailing stuff.
474000	477000	And like, like, like you just can't, it never stops.
477000	479000	You're just like, you love it and you hate it and you're a slave to it.
479000	483000	And then I was just like, I was like, you know, on the cot.
483000	490000	And I was just, you know, trying in vain to like not, it's like my uncle's kind of like tossing and turning and snoring.
490000	497000	And then, and then, and then he just like, after a really long arduous time, he like, he sat up and I froze
497000	500000	and then he like made a big deal out of like going to the bathroom.
500000	502000	And he took a really long time.
502000	505000	And I truly do think, I think he was like, Jesus Christ.
505000	510000	If I pretend to take a shit, will you finish?
510000	515000	I really think that's what he was doing, but I just froze because I was like, oh God, is that,
515000	517000	I was thinking, is that what's happening?
517000	518000	Did he hear me?
518000	519000	Was he awake the whole time?
519000	520000	And now is that what he's doing?
520000	526000	And it took me so long to just deal with that humiliation that he eventually came back.
526000	531000	And then I was like, well, he must have been so busy.
531000	534000	Are you kidding me?
534000	539000	Well, you didn't have bunk beds like Jeff and I did.
539000	540000	Jeff, your brother.
540000	541000	My brother.
541000	544000	My brother was on the bottom bunk.
544000	548000	So what are you, you guys just listened to each other?
548000	551000	He listened to me.
551000	552000	Problem.
552000	556000	I mean, I mean, just because I was a, you know, I was a mantras Humper too.
556000	560000	So it's just like, I'm just a picture and I felt like, man, nobody knows.
560000	561000	I'm fucking good at this.
561000	564000	I'm like smooth man, smooth operator.
564000	567000	And he's probably, and you know, Jeff, he's not going to let go.
567000	569000	Hey, hey.
569000	570000	Enough.
570000	571000	Yeah.
571000	575000	Come on, you know, so people got to work for a living.
575000	577000	You know, like poor Jeff.
577000	586000	He's got like the, the, the, the spring mattress is probably like, oh geez.
586000	587000	Oh dear.
587000	588000	And he's your older brother.
588000	589000	Older brother.
589000	593000	So he's sitting down there going like, boy, what did I miss?
593000	596000	You know, like, why isn't he doing it too?
596000	597000	Maybe he was.
597000	604000	I didn't know sound travels downward.
604000	605000	All right.
605000	609000	Well, yeah, there's not much of a show tonight, as you can see.
609000	611000	It's because I'm here.
611000	612000	Jeff's gone.
612000	615000	We replaced him with Schwab.
615000	620000	Duncan Trussell was, it was, I told him come to the show, but I think he might be just
620000	623000	like, he might be at meltdown going, what the fuck?
623000	624000	Yeah.
624000	625000	I mean, that's no joke.
625000	626000	That might, that could be the case.
626000	627000	So empty, empty.
627000	632000	I did his podcast and you know, and I was like, you should come to mind, but, but whatever.
632000	635000	I hear you watched old it recently.
635000	636000	Yeah.
636000	637000	Yeah.
637000	640000	I watched Steven, the old Stephen King's it got caught up on that.
640000	641000	Yeah.
641000	643000	In anticipation of the new Stephen King's it.
643000	644000	Yep.
644000	646000	Old it and old it versus new.
646000	648880	I've seen old it a lot.
648880	654240	I probably watched it with you a bunch of times and I've just saw the new it like last
654240	656240	weekend.
656240	657240	You saw the new one.
657240	658240	I saw the new it.
658240	659240	Yes.
659240	660240	Do they all float?
660240	661240	They, they do.
661240	662240	They do.
662240	668000	Uh, but, uh, what did you say about the, the old it not much?
668000	671920	Nobody got Cody watched it with me and she's like, nobody floated now kept saying they
671920	672920	all float down here.
672920	677240	There's never any float down here.
677240	683560	And we have talked about the fact that in the book, uh, the boys all have sex with the
683560	684560	girl.
684560	685560	Right.
685560	687560	Because it's her idea.
687560	691560	She goes, well, it's one thing left to do.
691560	698400	The only way to get out of this sewer dimension is to, well, all right.
698400	700320	And all the boys are going, Jesus Christ.
700320	701320	Are you serious?
702120	703120	I was thinking about Stephen King.
703120	710240	It's like, it's hard to put your finger on what he's good and bad at, but like, I think
710240	713360	if he was sitting here, he wouldn't, he would be like, yeah, that's true.
713360	719760	I don't, I just, I just, I know his origin story has something to do with, as I've said,
719760	725080	like, I think, you know, in the Marvel movie where Stephen King is a, is a hero in the
725080	729000	first 20 minutes, he's like carrying his typewriter and he drops it in the backspace.
729000	740120	He flies off and he's just like, but I have to turn in a, oh, and then he's like, it's
740120	750680	going to be, you can make it up as you go, it's going to be a thousand pages long.
750680	751840	I think he'd agree with that.
751840	754760	I don't think he'd be offended by that.
754760	762040	But it's one day, the thing, the thing about like the scene of in the book, it where all,
762040	763040	how many boys are there?
763040	764040	It's like Beverly.
764040	765040	How many?
765040	766040	Six.
766040	767040	Six.
767040	768040	Five, six.
768040	771560	Let's say five.
771560	775160	They like, Beverly starts taking off her clothes and they're like going, holy shit, I guess
775160	779440	we're going to have to, guess we're going to have to have sex with her.
779440	781280	And they're like 10.
781280	782280	They're 11.
782280	783280	Okay.
783280	784280	All right.
784800	789160	And, and I would be, I was like, okay, gross.
789160	791560	And I understand you're doing exploitation.
791560	794960	You could have wrote fade out, fade up.
794960	797640	They're all putting their sneakers on and going, wow, that was terrific.
797640	805480	And now we can get out of the sewer, but page after page of description and commenting on
805480	812920	sizes and, and shit and like going, I'm like, okay, I really don't need to know.
812920	817280	It's like, it's like, but he's like his favorite show is children.
817280	825000	Like, but, but I, you know, I mean, that being said, I mean, like, it, it, it, he's, but
825000	826000	I love it.
826000	827000	Okay.
827000	832360	It's, it's, it's really, it's like when you watch, when you watch the, the old it, which
832360	835800	is available on your little, and it's not called the old it.
835800	840640	So when you're typing it in, I keep typing in the old it and it, and it's not showing
840640	841640	up.
841640	846800	It's, it's two part miniseries in 19 and you should be aware of the studio that makes
846800	852320	those sort of like African-American recreations of like about last night and stuff like that.
852320	862160	There's a, there's a black it, um, uh, called, uh, blackish you had a bit.
862160	869360	I know why I didn't have a bit, but Jesus Christ, that's just the name of a show.
869360	875480	And it sounds like black it, you know, you just, you just see a dot, you just connect
875480	876480	the one you're on.
876480	877480	Yeah.
877480	878480	Yeah.
878480	879480	This is Stephen King of talking.
879480	881480	Uh, I am though.
881480	882480	I don't have a backspace.
882480	883480	And who here isn't?
883480	884480	Hi Spencer.
884480	885480	How are you?
885480	886480	Hey guys.
886480	887480	Yeah.
887480	891480	I, I just, everything, everything, this is the thing that I think Stephen King may is
891480	896440	either good or bad at, but in any case, he's, it's, it's an extreme condition he has.
897440	898440	Everything's a device.
898440	899440	Everything's like a crucifix.
899440	908000	Everything's a, there's like 90 things in it that if you use the power of positivity
908000	914940	or whatever, if you recite the birds in your Boy Scout manual, it makes the Tim Curry
914940	916960	clown go, go away.
916960	922880	If you, if you just aren't afraid, if you just hold hands and ignore everything, it
922880	926400	only can hurt you if you pay attention.
926400	932120	If you, if you have an asthma inhaler, you can just say it's acid and squirt it.
932120	933640	It's a slingshot.
933640	934960	It's silver.
934960	939440	And every step of the way, because he doesn't want to, he doesn't want to go back and like
939440	940440	refine anything.
940440	944120	Every, people are just like, Hey, I brought a slingshot and I brought a, I brought my
944120	945120	mom's earrings.
945120	946120	They're silver.
946120	947420	How do we know that'll work?
947420	949160	If we believe it, it'll work.
949160	950560	Oh, fuck you.
950560	952520	Fuck you.
952520	958440	But you have, you, do you have a favorite Stephen King, like adaptation book or something
958440	962280	you, I mean, I've always said, I liked his stuff when he was like a kid.
962280	966560	Like when you read those, those Bachman books, like the long walk, I thought was just like
966560	969000	really simple and granular.
969000	972400	It's like, you know, a hundred kids and they walk until one of them's left.
972400	976440	And if you drop below 10 miles an hour walking, they shoot your brains out.
976440	977440	Um, that's cool.
977440	978440	I like Carrie.
978440	981280	I think Carrie, Carrie, the book is, is great.
981280	982280	Yeah.
982280	983280	Okay.
983280	992920	Well, remember when I told you about the library policeman, when I was listening to on, on,
992920	998200	I was listening to the book on tape, the library policeman, which is a story short story, uh,
998200	1002120	where there's this guy who's like, Oh man, something bad happened to me as a kid.
1002120	1005840	I can't recall it cause I blocked it and it's the thing I have to get over this fear.
1005840	1010680	Otherwise I'm, I'm gonna, I won't be able to kill this monster in the library.
1010680	1013760	Oh, how am I going to get over this thing that I can't remember that happened to me
1013760	1014760	as a kid?
1014760	1018240	You know, and I'm listening to it for like days cause I'm on the way to work.
1018240	1021040	I would listen to it like, you know, like 20 minutes at a time.
1021040	1027680	And then finally it was like the chapter where we, he meets up with him, like he faces this
1027680	1034000	fear and Kate and I were like going to a party and I go, Hey hon, you know, I just, I really
1034000	1035640	want to know what happens here.
1035640	1038480	Do you mind if I just play this on the way and she's like, yeah, I don't give a fuck
1038480	1039480	whatever.
1039480	1040480	I don't give a shit.
1040480	1041480	All right.
1041480	1042480	All right.
1042480	1043480	I'm like, thanks honey.
1043480	1044480	I love you.
1044480	1051360	And then it goes into again, great detail about how when he was eight years old, he
1051360	1058120	was molested by this, this guy in the bushes and just describing in great detail about
1058120	1066120	like how the warm jelly went up his ass and I'm just, and it's just like a quiet drive
1066120	1071480	and it's like, I don't want to press stop because that's admitting that this is gross
1071480	1072480	and whatever.
1072480	1078520	And Kate is just like, I'm fucking married to this guy.
1078520	1082000	This is what I, I guess I signed up for this.
1082000	1083000	I knew, oh my God.
1083000	1084720	Who was reading the book on tape?
1084720	1089680	Oh, uh, I forget his name, but he was, his name, it was the guy who played the white
1089680	1094240	shadow in the, remember the TV series, the white shadow.
1094240	1096360	You guys remember the white shadow from the seventies.
1096360	1097360	It's a ship.
1097360	1098360	Okay.
1098360	1099360	All right.
1099360	1100360	It was that guy.
1100360	1104320	It was a white basketball coach and then the, uh, his mostly black, uh, high school, high
1104320	1106320	school basketball team.
1106320	1111160	I believe it was a high school basketball team and it was called the white shadow.
1111160	1117640	It was called the white shadow, little, little, little, little playing with the concepts of
1117640	1122800	shadows are usually not white.
1122800	1123800	They're the opposite.
1123800	1124800	Hi, Spencer.
1124800	1125800	Hey guys.
1125800	1126800	Yeah.
1126800	1133800	Spencer, if you watch, if you're like a 10 year old black kid and you're watching that
1133800	1137520	show in the seventies and you're like the white shadow, Oh, I get it.
1137520	1139600	Cause I'm like a shadow person.
1139600	1146600	It's supposed to be something like that every day, every cereal box is a minefield.
1146600	1152760	Every, every conversation, like that's what I'm, you know, why, why are you guys watching
1152760	1160160	and reacting to that observation as if I did something wrong?
1160160	1166840	Is it just because you are scared that now at the end of the world, someone's going to
1166840	1171000	mention by the way, we were kind of mean to black people.
1171000	1177080	Like that would make up the apocalypse a little worse, a little awkward, a little party foul
1177080	1178720	during Armageddon.
1178720	1186320	We should do that as the, just give me a second.
1186320	1187320	Okay.
1187320	1190760	No, you want to make this incredibly clear to you.
1190760	1195240	I don't fucking care about your opinions anymore.
1195240	1197800	You're terrible people.
1197800	1199440	You're dumb.
1199440	1203040	You're impressionable, manipulatable and stupid.
1203040	1207600	I know that seems like I added like a synonym for dumb, but it's two different things.
1207600	1209240	You have no voice.
1209240	1210720	You have no brain.
1210720	1212480	You're bad people.
1212480	1216440	You're a biomass of closet murderers.
1216440	1220160	You're only held in check by your fear.
1220160	1222040	Fuck off.
1222040	1228480	Our next guest is performing at clubs and colleges all across the nation.
1228480	1231480	Please welcome Eddie Pepitone.
1231480	1232480	Yes.
1232480	1233480	All right.
1233480	1234480	Follow that.
1234480	1235480	Follow that.
1235480	1236480	Follow that.
1236480	1237480	Hi Spencer.
1237480	1238480	Oh, I can see Spencer now.
1238480	1239480	Hi Spencer.
1239480	1240480	Oh.
1240480	1241480	Hi Edward.
1241480	1242480	Hello.
1242480	1243480	Edward.
1243480	1244480	Hello.
1244480	1245480	Edward, how are you?
1245480	1246480	You look great, man.
1246480	1247480	What's going on?
1247480	1248480	What are you doing?
1248480	1261040	I'm doing stand up right here actually every Wednesday night.
1261040	1263160	I'm doing stand up all over town.
1263160	1266640	I'm exploring stand up.
1266640	1273760	You know, I, yeah, because no, a lot of people think stand up is just set up punchline.
1273760	1280080	I think it's an enormous cry for help.
1280080	1287680	And it's tricky to make that funny, you know, but like a real, like just put my id, my id
1287680	1291600	on stage and kind of try not to be embarrassed about it.
1291600	1293720	How old were you when you started stand up?
1293720	1294720	How old was I?
1294720	1295720	Yeah.
1295720	1296720	How old were you?
1296720	1297720	57?
1297720	1298720	57.
1298720	1299720	You started?
1299720	1300720	No, I'm kidding.
1300720	1301720	Boy, that fell flat.
1301720	1302720	Hi everybody.
1302720	1303720	Fuck you.
1303720	1307040	There you go.
1307040	1308880	How is this room for stand up?
1308880	1310680	You've been doing it here for several sets.
1310680	1313360	So like, it's gotta be awful, right?
1313360	1314720	High ceilings and the ceiling.
1314760	1318160	Everybody says the high ceilings, but I like it.
1318160	1319240	I like it actually.
1319240	1320240	I don't know.
1320240	1324120	I don't know if it's just the vibe of the place.
1324120	1329920	And as far as, as far as stand up goes, it's, it's not so much what counts as high ceilings,
1329920	1332200	but who is in the audience, right?
1332200	1333200	You know what I mean?
1333200	1337480	This, this show, it's been fine because if it's a big giant room with high ceilings
1337480	1341080	and then there's like 200 people, okay, so it's like a town hall or whatever.
1341080	1346200	And also I'm not doing stand ups, so, but I wonder, yeah, about people, but, but I,
1346200	1349560	I want to let you know, and then I could do this off stage too, but I don't really have
1349560	1354880	anything to talk about on stage, but we're, we're, we're, we're putting the money that
1354880	1359760	we're, that we make off of the, the, the ticket stuff here we're, we're going to work, working
1359760	1366200	on changing, you know, making like kind of convertible adjustable things that are like
1366200	1369360	fine tune, the acoustic and optical.
1369360	1370360	Make it more intimate.
1371120	1372120	Yeah.
1372120	1374880	I want this place to be able to do a show with 30 people in the audience, you know?
1374880	1376040	That's perfect for me.
1376040	1377040	Yeah.
1377040	1383400	That's a little much 30, but if you could get it down to 1520, that would be perfect.
1383400	1388640	But then from, from what I understand, music is like, it's like, oh yeah, no fucking do
1388640	1390520	it in a big giant warehouse.
1390520	1392040	That's best for music.
1392040	1398520	So I want it to, I want to be able to like hoist a chain and make it conducive to a punk
1399040	1402040	band because I'm so enthusiastic about the music scene.
1404480	1405120	Me too.
1405120	1408760	I'm up on all, you know, every punk band there is.
1408760	1410960	What's your favorite punk band?
1410960	1411640	Right now?
1411640	1412440	Right now.
1412440	1413520	Dirty Rats.
1413520	1414560	Dirty Rats.
1414560	1418200	They're all Cagney impersonators and they're fucking brilliant.
1418800	1419640	It's you.
1419640	1423400	Yeah, you, you dirty fucking rod, you dirty fucking rod.
1423400	1426000	And they, they just go on and on like that.
1426680	1427760	It's all about vermin.
1427760	1428480	It's good.
1428480	1431160	Is that a, is that a, is that Spotify?
1432800	1433600	Yes.
1433600	1439360	By the way, I was listening to Stalin on Pandora on the way over and that's just a
1439360	1443760	sample of what you get when you come see me.
1443760	1446440	I'm a little dictator playlist on Pandora.
1446440	1446720	Yeah.
1446720	1449040	You see, you're, you're kind of holding in your laughter.
1449560	1451920	I got, I'm holding, I'm holding in my laughter.
1451920	1452120	Yeah.
1452120	1452920	I'm just sitting there.
1452920	1455560	No, I'm, I'm thinking of what I'm going to say next.
1455560	1456760	That's where I'm a bad interviewer.
1458760	1462760	I, I, I, but what I've, I've, I've heard cause you're doing these shows here.
1462760	1466760	Like I've, I, you know, this is no different from anywhere else.
1466760	1467360	You're doing shows.
1467360	1470440	I'm sure you're, you're like, I feel like one of the cool things about you is that
1470440	1474160	you're like, you've got, you've got your strong material, but then you're Eddie
1474160	1474760	Pepitone.
1474760	1476720	Like you just like, I'm Eddie Pepitone.
1476720	1481680	If you, if you, if you go off the rails, it's kind of, that's what I do.
1481720	1484160	That's what, that's what I like to do.
1484360	1489160	I started, I think I started, I've been getting into these riffs about the, the
1489160	1490080	hurricanes.
1491240	1493240	I want to try to provoke a, what's that?
1493280	1496440	I want to provoke a, a riff, but I know that that won't work.
1496480	1503280	Like if I announced that as my goal, I mean, I could, I could, I was just getting
1503280	1508640	into like the ghoulishness of the coverage of the hurricanes.
1509560	1516320	You know, first it was, it was Harvey and, and, and how I get attracted to the
1516320	1521360	hurricane, like following the hurricane, like they, they, they get to it early.
1521720	1526320	The, you know, CNN, you know, the weather channel and they're just fine.
1526520	1529800	And they're like, look at this fucking, they don't say fuck, but they're like,
1530080	1536480	look at this fucking, that's not a good face by the way, to be like, yeah, that's
1536480	1539200	better. Holy shit.
1539200	1540160	I looked over Rob.
1540160	1544880	You look like God, not another hurricane story.
1547400	1552040	It is kind of insane in general, the storm stuff that stems from like just this
1552040	1557520	general thing where your local news, if something happened at a school, someone
1557520	1561760	stabbed someone with a pencil at the school behind me, like they take the van
1561760	1567960	out and the satellite dish goes up, but it's like, no one's getting stabbed now.
1568040	1572200	They're just like, there's just rows of white vans and there's all these people
1572200	1575400	and they're just at the place where the stabbing took place.
1575400	1579360	Like there's absolutely zero chance that it's going to be important to be at that
1579360	1581040	location in a journalistic sense.
1581040	1586920	I like, nothing's going to, it's never, there's not even an example in history of
1586920	1590800	like, of like, oh yeah, we just kind of do that because you never know.
1591040	1592320	No, there's nothing to never know.
1592320	1594520	Like there's not like a, I found an eraser.
1595040	1597400	I found a clue, ladies and gentlemen, that's the police's job.
1598320	1601720	You're not out there for any reason, but then, and then the storms happen and it's
1601720	1604560	just people being blown by wind.
1605360	1609760	It was hilarious because when the storms happen, you know, they, the, the, and they
1609760	1614160	live for this, you know, what, what, what I hate about it is that they, they're
1614160	1615560	always like, be safe.
1615560	1619240	They're always like, please be safe, be safe.
1619240	1624760	And, oh my God, I hope, you know, this hurricane doesn't hit land, but it's the
1624760	1625480	opposite.
1625480	1628080	I mean, it's the, they, they love it.
1628120	1630680	They love it because it's just a spectacle.
1630680	1633040	And that's what, you know, news media is about.
1633040	1634520	That's what the whole world has become about.
1634520	1636360	It's all be, it's all spectacle.
1636360	1636840	Hold on.
1638840	1644080	It's all you, you wanted to provoke some, let him talk, let him talk for Christ's
1644120	1651440	sake, let him talk for once and I masturbate too.
1651440	1652480	Don't get me wrong.
1655000	1663200	I still run home and do it, but I mean, they, so they're always, they're always
1663200	1664720	like, be safe, be safe.
1665000	1668680	And they're like, nobody should be out here, but they are out there and it's
1669360	1675480	nobody should be out here having fun, but me, Jim Cantori.
1675480	1676600	It was very funny.
1677080	1680560	This guy, Jim Cantori is apparently like that.
1680560	1686600	It is very funny too, that he's like the Dean of media of TV meteorologists, you
1686600	1689320	know, for whatever reason, the Dean of TV.
1689520	1690560	There's, well, you know what I mean?
1690560	1694920	Like, like people referred him like, what does Jim think about this?
1694920	1698160	What does the Dean think about this meteorology?
1698240	1699200	I think he said the King.
1699200	1700560	I don't think he ever said the Dean.
1700760	1701960	He never said the Dean.
1702560	1703520	I'm just, I did.
1703560	1704360	Did you say the Dean?
1704400	1704680	Yeah.
1704840	1705200	Okay.
1705600	1705920	All right.
1706280	1706680	Well, no,
1708760	1710000	Oh no.
1710560	1711240	Oh no.
1711280	1715720	What, what did I, what did I, Oh, you weren't going to correct me and you were
1715720	1716160	wrong.
1716160	1720040	I was trying to, I was trying to help people.
1720040	1721040	They're stupid.
1721080	1721880	They are.
1721920	1722480	Go fight.
1722480	1723520	You're stupid.
1723720	1724520	You're stupid.
1724520	1727400	You didn't hear what he said and you're closer to him.
1728160	1732880	That's not making them any smarter.
1732880	1736680	And I was trying to help you and made a mistake.
1736840	1739760	You're revealing that you're a bad person too.
1740120	1743680	I thought that you needed help and helped you.
1743720	1745360	Don't fight mommy and daddy.
1746400	1747200	Don't fight.
1747720	1748760	I don't believe you.
1748800	1749720	I don't believe you.
1749760	1755960	You don't believe you thought I was trying to capitalize on your, your
1755960	1756640	weakness.
1758440	1759320	Look what you're doing.
1759480	1760400	Look what you're doing.
1761560	1764480	I have my nice hat on and you're fighting.
1764480	1764880	I know.
1764880	1765320	I know.
1765680	1767960	It's not, it's not your, it's not your fault.
1768040	1768880	It's not your fault.
1769120	1770040	Now I feel good.
1770720	1772280	I never got that when I was a kid.
1772280	1773160	It's not your fault.
1773160	1777040	The Dean of meteorology has ever just died.
1777040	1782600	Like, like, like, like the, I know, I mean, by gun, we have like horrible examples
1782600	1785920	of like that guy just fucking, it's, it's like, we're living in some weird dream
1786560	1793640	because that guy that shot, he shot a news crew while they were doing the news, you
1793640	1796880	know, and like, that happened recently and a couple of years ago.
1796880	1797160	Yeah.
1797240	1797920	Oh, couple of years.
1797960	1800240	Now that to me, that's good news.
1800640	1802640	Like that is good news.
1802840	1803640	That's real.
1803640	1804920	That's really happening.
1806680	1808360	But they didn't know they were covering it.
1808400	1811200	And they were, they didn't know they were covering it.
1811200	1815160	They were outside a school or someone got stabbed with a pencil three hours earlier.
1815520	1821760	The, the, the, the, it's weird, like, but we've never seen anybody, like, no one's
1821760	1824080	ever, as many storms as there've been.
1824080	1828360	I'm surprised that there hasn't been journalist fatalities, you know, from people
1828360	1830360	like standing out in the 80 mile an hour winds.
1830360	1837200	Oh, I was so hoping, yeah, I was so hoping, I was so hoping that, you know, this guy,
1837240	1841160	they had a couple of guys, but I was so hoping they would just be carried the fucking
1841160	1848120	away and, and, and one guy, one guy did not, but Jim Cantori, the Dean, by the way,
1848120	1849480	when you say, why is he the Dean?
1849760	1850920	Now I'm confused.
1850920	1852720	Well, you've never heard that term.
1852720	1858080	Like he is like, you know, the go-to guy as far as meteorologists.
1858080	1860800	So you've never heard that, that little expression Dean.
1861000	1863040	You, have you ever been called into a Dean's office?
1863040	1864160	It's always a meteorologist.
1864160	1864520	I'm kidding.
1866520	1868240	That'd be funny if you, hey, how are you?
1868440	1869280	I'm all right.
1870280	1876440	I feel like I got to keep him entertained, but, um, no, because I looked at him and he had
1876440	1880200	to say, no, he's, yeah, you had that fucking look.
1880240	1881240	It's just him listening.
1881240	1882000	It's a, yeah.
1882720	1886800	But by the way, when you said you didn't say Dean, right?
1886840	1892640	I want to be liked so much by everybody that I was going to, there was a split second
1892640	1894400	where I was going to go, no, I didn't.
1895920	1896160	Right.
1896160	1898160	Then I realized everybody else had heard it.
1898480	1900240	Whether to pretend you said King.
1900240	1900520	All right.
1900520	1901040	I get it.
1902200	1902520	Yeah.
1902520	1907400	I, I, I have been a slave to people's, uh, let me ask you this.
1907440	1907600	Yeah.
1907600	1908000	Okay.
1908040	1913640	Uh, uh, pick, pick your nose in front of a friend or a stranger that you'll never see
1913640	1916160	again, uh, on the freeway, for instance.
1916200	1918920	Like, like, like, like, like, which, you know, I, you know, it's amazing.
1918960	1920560	I've thought of that a lot.
1920960	1926200	Um, and I was preparing for the podcast, but I'm, when, when I am on the, when I am
1926200	1933200	on, uh, you know, a street and I'm about to pick my nose in the car, I, I can't do
1933200	1934680	it in front of a stranger.
1934720	1935120	Right.
1935440	1937720	I can't do it because you'll never see them again.
1937760	1938400	What is that?
1938400	1943200	I was sick is that, but you'll like, and I won't pick my nose in front of my girlfriend
1943200	1945200	because I just don't want her to see me.
1945240	1948520	I just don't want her to see a thing come out, but well, it depends on how late in
1948520	1949680	the relationship it is.
1950120	1952520	We, we, we're farting all over each other at this point.
1952520	1954160	And then I like, like, like, and it's great.
1954160	1955080	We're having a great time.
1955240	1960120	And that's, uh, my, my, my ex-wife, we, we did a thing like that.
1960120	1964280	I, uh, Sarah Silverman, uh, had told me that she and Jimmy Kimmel never farted in
1964280	1964880	front of each other.
1964880	1969040	So I tried it with, uh, Aaron McGathey, you know, Aaron, my ex-wife, or maybe you
1969040	1970880	don't, but you said you're a podcast maven.
1970880	1974440	Maybe, you know, my ex-wife, but, but Aaron and I really never farted.
1974440	1978120	You know, there was a couple, couple of accidents happened here and there, all
1978120	1984520	Aaron, um, uh, no, but, but, but, but we just did it, you know, as I spent my
1984520	1988240	marriage, not farting, and that's not why we got divorced.
1989400	1992040	I was going to say it worked fine.
1992040	1996040	It was like, I was, I'm surprised looking back that I was able to not fart in front
1996080	2002000	of my partner for so long, given how much I fart with Cody.
2002040	2003880	We're just farting constantly.
2003920	2008280	So it's like, what was I, I don't know what natural human behavior is anymore.
2008600	2013200	I don't even know what my body needed to do or what's healthy or what I just like
2013200	2013520	now.
2013600	2019240	Well, I think what you're talking about there, Dan is, um, a great example of what
2019240	2023120	we can do when we put our mind to something, you know, when we, when we
2023120	2028800	introduce our will and with your ex-wife, you were exercising tremendous will.
2028880	2029160	Yeah.
2029840	2030040	Yeah.
2030080	2033600	Cause it's not like I was like in tremendous abdominal pain going like,
2033600	2035280	Oh, I made this agreement.
2035320	2038480	It wasn't, I don't remember really needing to fart.
2038480	2040360	Did you like go into other rooms?
2040480	2044720	I would, yeah, some, every once in a while, it would build up to a point.
2044720	2049120	And I would go, I tell her I'm going to go fart, you know, like, but I just
2049120	2050360	wouldn't do it in front of her.
2050400	2051480	What about, what about your,
2051720	2053280	Oh, wait, uh, same stories.
2053280	2057120	There is the same thing about like keeping the intimacy in your relationship.
2057120	2059080	And Kate and I don't fart in front of each other.
2059400	2060560	I mean, you're still doing that.
2060640	2061320	I'm still doing that.
2061320	2064520	And it's been, is Sarah still with that guy?
2064560	2064760	No.
2066640	2069000	Was she during the advice?
2069160	2069720	What's that?
2069720	2071480	Was she during the advice?
2071560	2072040	Oh, okay.
2072040	2073000	She wasn't giving advice.
2073000	2077480	She was just talking about something that she was doing with her partner.
2077880	2079480	But I, and I thought I'd give it a try.
2079680	2080000	Yeah.
2080200	2081000	And it worked.
2081040	2084920	It's not why we got divorced and you've done it for seven years and it's,
2084960	2089000	and you're not getting divorced in that, but yeah, at the same time, I can't
2089000	2091600	believe it's just like, I guess it's just, it's just a couple thing.
2091600	2095080	It's like me and Cody are like, uh, let's fart.
2095120	2097840	I have been forgetting to flush the toilet.
2100560	2104400	Which is causing like issues.
2104440	2104800	Yeah.
2105480	2106920	I blame wifi.
2110320	2112000	Cause it's fucking up the bees.
2112200	2114520	You know, they can't find their way home now.
2114560	2115000	Right.
2115000	2116160	Spencer back me up.
2116800	2119440	The wifi is screwing up the bees.
2119440	2119800	Right.
2119880	2121520	This is what I'm telling Kate when she comes.
2121520	2122800	Oh Jesus Christ.
2124120	2127960	Did you dump a cup of coffee in the toilet?
2129880	2131320	And a plate of spaghetti.
2131600	2132600	Oh shit.
2133120	2135720	I forgot to flush the toilet every day.
2135720	2136840	You forget to flush the toilet.
2136880	2145440	I didn't say, I think it's wifi because bees are, are dying out because of wifi.
2145440	2148360	They, they, they get their radar.
2148360	2150000	They can't find their way home.
2151000	2156720	So I'm thinking there's like a wifi pocket that is just between the office and
2156720	2158680	the living room and the bedroom.
2158680	2162120	There's like a Bermuda triangle right where I'm going to the bathroom.
2162480	2165680	And for some reason, you know, I get done.
2165760	2171240	I also have the bridal swash, which the special toilet seat.
2171400	2171720	Right.
2171760	2173000	You know, my special toilet seat.
2173000	2176880	What, what, what, what, what's your download speed like on the toilet?
2176920	2179760	If you're, you're, cause you're saying the wifi is the strongest there.
2179760	2184200	You're referring to it as a Bermuda triangle, but wifi wise it's, it's grand
2184200	2184560	central.
2184560	2185080	It's pretty good.
2185440	2185960	It's pretty good.
2186240	2186640	Okay.
2186840	2187200	Yeah.
2187280	2187440	All right.
2187440	2189720	But I think it's making me forget to flush the toilet.
2190680	2192200	Cause this is a recent thing.
2192240	2194520	You do a lot of computer work on the toilet.
2196320	2197040	Is that what you're saying?
2197040	2197760	You're on the, you're on.
2202160	2205720	So you have a, he, I don't do computers on the toilet.
2205920	2212960	He has a special, uh, uh, seat, uh, that's like a bidet, uh, extension
2213000	2213920	upgrade on the seat.
2214320	2216440	Do you wipe your ass with toilet paper?
2216520	2216840	Yeah.
2217320	2217720	Okay.
2217960	2222480	So the dry my ass because it's beautifully clean now because you've
2222480	2225680	been getting up, wiping your ass, putting the toilet paper into the
2225680	2230400	toilet and someone else walking out the door, just walk it away.
2230640	2231360	Like I got a train.
2231360	2235840	It may, don't you think it may be the bidet comes home and opens up and
2235840	2237000	it goes, what the fuck?
2237240	2237960	Seriously.
2237960	2240560	And what's your, what's your, uh, your offer?
2240600	2241840	It says it's a bidet.
2242280	2242880	Well, I don't know.
2242880	2244480	Maybe it's the bidet action.
2244920	2249600	But I've had this bidet for like, I've been, I had a bidet for like,
2249680	2251880	like over like 10 years.
2251880	2252560	I think it's funny.
2252560	2253720	You have a bidet by the way.
2254960	2257480	And I don't consider you a man like a real man.
2258240	2263680	I would not watch a football game with you or when you would go to the
2263680	2266040	bathroom during the game, I would be like horrified.
2266040	2267800	I would be like, let's get the fuck out of here.
2268720	2269280	No, no.
2269280	2271280	You hear that stream of water, Al.
2271760	2276560	I'll press the button and it'll go beep and it'll go, it goes beep.
2277080	2277480	Yeah.
2277480	2278480	I mean, it's beeps.
2285320	2288920	I would be afraid of getting, uh, I would be afraid of getting injured.
2290080	2291680	That's what, that's what the beeps for.
2292200	2293480	That's what the beeps for.
2294080	2296080	It's yeah.
2297080	2297840	And you love it.
2297840	2300840	And then you dry off with the toilet paper and then you dry off with the
2300840	2303760	paper and then you won't have, then I walked the fuck out the door.
2303760	2308000	But I, but this is, I've been, the bidet I've been using way longer.
2308000	2309120	This is a recent thing.
2309120	2314320	Like in the last two years, no, not two last year, it's just been like, Kate's
2314320	2317000	like, what the fuck is, and I go, I'm so sorry, honey.
2317000	2318960	I just, I don't know what I thought I did.
2318960	2323560	You know, you're like, and now I'm so nervous about getting yelled at and
2323560	2326440	embarrassed about it that like she'll come home and I'll just like, oh, don't,
2326440	2329360	don't go to the bed and I run in there and I'll flush the toilet.
2329840	2334600	And I know we have a rule that just, just, just, just to save the marriage,
2334600	2338000	just without opening up the seat, just, just flush the toilet.
2338000	2340480	Just, just for, just to be safe.
2340520	2343000	Occam's razor says it's old age.
2343000	2345360	I mean, that's the easier explanation.
2345360	2346880	You're okay.
2348880	2350560	Leave a note to yourself.
2350600	2351840	Like, Oh yeah.
2351840	2355880	Leave a note, tie a, tie a string around my finger.
2356640	2361600	Uh, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what mnemonic device more than a
2361600	2367640	toilet full of shit to, uh, it should work.
2367680	2368560	I don't know.
2368560	2372320	I mean, what about this self flushing toilets they have at airports and stuff?
2372320	2373440	Why don't you get one of them?
2373440	2374320	I should get one of them.
2374600	2375840	You know, the self flushers.
2375840	2377040	I want to, I want to upgrade.
2377040	2379800	I want to get the one that has the, that blows the air.
2379960	2383120	The one that like opens by itself.
2383600	2388160	Uh, yeah, I want to, I want to, I want to really do it up, you know, one that
2388160	2389520	drives you to the airport.
2389520	2392920	I want to, one that closes my dreamworks deal.
2392920	2396280	You know, take me to LAX.
2396280	2397560	You piece of shit.
2398640	2403120	Do you think we would ever see in our lifetime, like just an end to, I
2403120	2409040	mean, like, like, do you think before we die, we'll just see at least on the
2409040	2414080	internet and some kind of like, like Japanese press release video or
2414080	2420080	something like the technology that eliminates somehow just no more shitting
2420200	2420840	in the toilet.
2420840	2421760	I would love that.
2421840	2423960	Like, I don't know.
2423960	2425960	It's either like a vacuum type.
2425960	2431320	It's like, just like a booth and the, and a purple line goes down your body.
2431320	2434400	And then there's no more poo poos in your body.
2434520	2435160	Purple line.
2435160	2435360	Yeah.
2435360	2442280	Or you just have an implant that, that as you, as your food becomes poop, there's
2442280	2447600	like a, there's a point in your intestinal tract where there's like a portal to who
2449040	2454200	to, to a, to a shared toilet in Portland.
2456400	2456600	Yeah.
2456600	2457400	What do you, what do you mean?
2457400	2459720	It was like, you know, you're like, okay, bye, bye.
2459720	2464000	This new, you, you swallow like basically, uh, uh, you know, a
2464000	2469200	Seth Brundle like telepod and then you just, it looks like an IUD.
2469200	2470040	I think it was, or what's that?
2470040	2473800	Or are those like, uh, it's like a flexi thing and you swallow it.
2473800	2478400	And then it like, it's designed to like, puts a Stargate in your ass when it hits
2478400	2482840	a certain point, it puts a, it puts a Stargate, not in your start that.
2482840	2487560	And that would be like a Sam Elliott type voice, put a Stargate in your ass.
2487560	2488440	Actually, you know what?
2488440	2490160	I, yeah, I'm thinking about this all wrong.
2490480	2493520	Put it right in your, the rim of your ass.
2493840	2495280	First of all, it feels good.
2495280	2501600	Second of all, you get to still have like a baby, the feeling of taking
2501600	2506920	a shit in your pants and it just is going into a portal into a portal.
2507760	2509480	And then add some alien planet.
2509480	2514880	This is the Starship troopers, uh, uh, like pre pre-movie or whatever.
2514880	2518000	Like there's like, there are all these insect people are like, Oh no,
2518000	2519760	well, it's raining again.
2520960	2522280	Where's this coming from?
2523320	2524400	We just tracked it.
2524400	2526200	It's just this earth place.
2526680	2529320	It just says it's going to stop us into the future.
2529760	2532360	You know, like that's how short sighted we are as a culture.
2532360	2534000	It just sends it five years in the future.
2534240	2536360	We're like, come on, we'll worry about it later.
2536720	2537040	Yeah.
2538480	2542720	Well, luckily we won't be around too much longer on this planet.
2542720	2543440	We're not going to be.
2543440	2544720	No, I don't think so.
2544760	2547480	Not to bum everybody out, but a year.
2547800	2550160	I doubt we're going to be on this planet very much.
2550160	2551200	Don't worry about bumming them out.
2551200	2553200	They're idiots, man.
2553960	2558600	Like the difference between them being, I don't think you're excited about life.
2558720	2564440	I don't think the difference between a fly, uh, having a saddle on it or not.
2564440	2566960	Like who's going to notice you can't ride a fly.
2568280	2569600	He's insulting you.
2569600	2570520	He doesn't mean it.
2570520	2571240	He doesn't mean it.
2571560	2572280	He doesn't mean it.
2572520	2572800	Right.
2572800	2573720	Dan, you don't mean it.
2573760	2574280	I mean it.
2574440	2574960	He doesn't mean it.
2575200	2578520	No, this is part of my therapy.
2578520	2580920	I've become too reliant on people's approval.
2580920	2583760	So what I've always been good at is abuse.
2583800	2588840	So I'm using that to wean myself off of your expectations.
2589480	2590520	If it hurts you.
2593120	2594200	Well, it seems to be making me happy.
2594200	2595040	It's not going to hurt you.
2595040	2596080	You're sociopaths.
2596080	2597280	You don't have feelings.
2597280	2603360	There's the idea that I've been doing something or anything for people because
2603360	2604400	you have feelings.
2604920	2612360	It's been my problem that I've been making your problem for 40 years.
2612720	2614800	I need to figure out who the fuck I am.
2615080	2615600	Me too.
2616200	2616560	Yeah.
2616920	2617400	Me too.
2617400	2618040	What do I like?
2618080	2622760	I mean, this is the regarding Henry stage of our lives.
2622760	2624360	We need to regard our Henrys.
2624400	2624640	Yeah.
2625360	2626840	Do I like rich crackers?
2626880	2627600	Or eggs?
2633360	2637680	I like eggs more.
2637920	2641360	What's going on in your in your personal life?
2641360	2643120	Can I tell you the question?
2643120	2645120	Do you like eggs or rich crackers?
2648600	2649280	I thank you.
2650080	2651600	I think I'll go with the cracker.
2652600	2653200	That'd be good.
2653240	2653480	Yeah.
2653480	2659120	I mean, I what are you hiding?
2659160	2663320	Yeah, I just crackers are more utilitarian.
2663360	2666320	I mean, they're it's never a bad time for a cracker.
2666320	2666600	Right.
2667240	2669720	It's never a bad time for a cracker.
2669720	2674040	So you're so you're pro, you're pro cracker.
2674080	2674680	Just say it.

2721320	2722440	You know what I know?
2723040	2723920	You don't know.
2723920	2724680	You don't know.
2725800	2726480	You don't know.
2727080	2727520	Yes.
2727520	2728240	I'm married.
2728480	2729000	Oh, you're married.
2729040	2731440	I'm married to Mrs.
2731440	2732040	Pepitone.
2732200	2732960	Mrs.
2732960	2734680	She did not take my name.
2735320	2735680	Yeah.
2736080	2739880	So what her last name must be awesome then because Pepitone is pretty rad.
2740440	2741200	It is right.
2741200	2742360	Would marry you.
2742360	2743040	I was hurt.
2743240	2744480	I was hurt by that.
2744480	2746920	Actually, just a little, a little hurt.
2746920	2749800	Like I was like, so baby, I called my wife, baby.
2749800	2750920	I'm like, so baby.
2751000	2753360	Um, how are we going to do this?
2753360	2754080	Are you going to be?
2757520	2758440	How are we going to do this?
2758440	2761320	It's becoming like, are you going to make it?
2761320	2763880	And she was like, you know, she, she didn't flint.
2763880	2766480	You know, she's like, I want to stay with Karen Simmons.
2766480	2767200	Makes sense.
2767200	2769040	I mean, yeah.
2769560	2772240	I mean, if you really think of, if you're like from Mars and someone
2772240	2776600	explained the, that rule, I think you're married to the woman's last name changes.
2776920	2777920	You'd be like, what?
2778240	2779640	That doesn't make really any sense.
2779640	2780920	It's just what we're used to.
2781000	2781320	Right.
2781320	2785040	And we actually, to the point where we also use it to express, for instance,
2785040	2788960	joy or, you know, like for somebody, I'm not knocking on any woman out there
2788960	2790880	that like happily took her husband's name.
2790880	2794800	Like it doesn't, you're not, you're not a sellout any more than anyone
2794800	2797240	that doesn't want to do that as an enemy of the state.
2797240	2801640	It's like, but it's just crazy that like it is, it is just a crazy random rule.
2801640	2806000	You know, like it's just weird with probably roots in like horrible stuff.
2806000	2809240	But, but, but, you know, it's in Spain.
2809240	2813960	I took a Spanish class at community college and that whole, that whole like
2814120	2819080	name thing, they have like a, they have like this whole rule, you know,
2819080	2823760	like this whole set of rules where it's like, it's like, uh, your last name
2823760	2825960	gets longer and longer or something.
2825960	2828200	Like I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't figure it out.
2828200	2831720	I insisted that Kate keep her last name.
2832240	2833960	Cause she, did she want your last name?
2833960	2835040	She begged you, she begged you.
2835040	2835920	Schwab, right?
2836120	2838920	Schwab is not, and this is not, uh, anything personal.
2838920	2841160	It's just not a good last name.
2841920	2846480	It just, I mean, Pepitone, Pepitone has a fucking ring to it.
2847320	2852400	You know, but Schwab, it's a, it sounds like a product of some sort.
2852960	2856840	Like have you used the Schwab today or you know what I mean?
2857000	2861880	Like if you don't use a Schwab, you could get seriously ill.
2862360	2863040	You know what I mean?
2863360	2865720	I mean, so does Pepitone, but like an awesome product.
2865720	2868920	Like it makes your tires smell like minty.
2871040	2872240	It makes your tires minty.
2873880	2875200	Minty push Pepitone.
2875600	2877960	You're driving to the airport, you get a flat tire.
2878400	2880920	It would be fine, but it stinks.
2882920	2884400	Tires are shit.
2885200	2886480	Your car's insured.
2886480	2890760	Your flight can be changed, but the smell in your nose is permanent
2890760	2892680	because you didn't use Pepitone.
2892680	2893520	I'm Robert Stack.
2896120	2899480	Pepitone, the tire smeller.
2902000	2905200	We were thinking, uh, some, I think, I think it was Chris Hardwick who one
2905200	2908440	time he ran up to me and said, listen, we can make a lot of money.
2908880	2914200	If we do Pepitones on the iPhone or some shit like that.
2914200	2923080	Like why, why did he say, let me finish the controller who uses a bidet.
2923080	2927240	A man should not use a bidet round of applause.
2927240	2928400	If you're with me on that.
2930040	2931000	Fuck you.
2932840	2934080	You haven't seen my ass.
2934120	2935160	I like the booze.
2935520	2936800	The booze are funny.
2938480	2939920	Of course they should.
2940640	2942120	Of course they should.
2942880	2943840	We're people.
2943960	2946520	We're, we're proud bidet for men.
2946560	2949080	Yes, we're proud bidet.
2949080	2955800	I, I really don't, I really don't care.
2955840	2956360	Yes.
2956480	2957120	I know you do.
2957120	2959640	I'm kind of making it up and that's why shut up.
2959920	2966000	And that's why, that's why you booing is funny to me because I really
2966000	2966640	could give a shit.
2966840	2968360	You seem to switch your position.
2968360	2968880	Okay.
2969360	2972480	Like, like you're not, do you do that?
2972520	2974960	That's part of being well, like, sorry.
2974960	2976560	You had to clarify for everybody.
2976880	2980880	You said, I really don't care after you completely flipped your position.
2981280	2982440	Like, we know you don't care.
2983600	2984520	I'm proud bidet.
2984520	2986560	And then they applauded and you're like, I don't care.
2989640	2990320	Yes.
2990840	2992160	That's what I do that a lot.
2992160	2993200	I don't know who I am.
2993280	2993600	Yeah.
2993760	2995400	I don't know who I am either.
2995520	2998440	My regarding Henry thing is Spencer knows exactly.
2998440	3000080	I don't either as you do.
3000240	3001160	It's great.
3003720	3006200	I feel like I belong on this stage.
3007560	3009200	We don't know who we are.
3011000	3014080	I guess it's a lot less exciting for you guys.
3015680	3017960	I can't, I can't, I can't wait for that new iPhone.
3018320	3019080	Oh, yeah.
3020720	3021920	Oh, yeah.
3021960	3022440	Oh, yeah.
3022440	3022920	Oh, yeah.
3022920	3025440	You're being, you're being not serious.
3025440	3025720	Right.
3025720	3026240	Serious.
3026240	3027720	I'm definitely being serious.
3027720	3029760	It's got a screen that goes all the way to here.
3029760	3033720	I know exactly what person this makes me and I'm tired of tired of the charade.
3033720	3044640	I fucking I would if Apple tomorrow announced a thumbtack that read your pinky
3044640	3053160	print and alerted you to nearby cork nearby what nearby cork.
3053200	3054880	It's the it's the eye attack.
3055640	3063680	It's it's the we asked ourselves what is a thumbtack and the answer was it's not
3064000	3067120	pin nor should it be.
3068640	3075160	And we set about changing fundamentally the spirits between the person who wants to pin
3075160	3079680	something to a bulletin board and the pin itself.
3080200	3081240	This is it.
3082240	3084120	I would I would fucking buy it.
3084120	3085080	I would buy it.
3085440	3086160	You would buy it.
3087080	3094400	Oh, let me put an asterisk on this because I deserve the humiliation that I like.
3094400	3095240	But I'm being free.
3095840	3099040	I wouldn't buy it if it was affordable.
3101440	3104760	It would have to be egregiously priced.
3104760	3109800	We have to be a forty nine dollar thumbtack for me to go like, well, there must be
3109800	3110760	something to this.
3112320	3113360	And I would do it.
3113480	3115760	And here's some other things I would do.
3116760	3125880	I if you told me when I went to the airport that for 70 dollars extra on my ticket, I
3125880	3131800	was allowed to stand in a red circle that was in a less comfortable place.
3132400	3134720	I would I would opt for that.
3134720	3139840	I would if you called it like Platinum Plus red circle program, I would stand in the red
3139840	3140360	circle.
3141280	3145880	When I go to the airport, I go, I go like, well, let's see if they have a lounge.
3145880	3149160	And Cody and Jeff are always like, fucking lounges suck.
3149160	3152280	There's like a seat here at the McDonald's or whatever.
3152280	3153680	And they get a full bar.
3153680	3156240	And I'm like, but the we don't even know the lounge.
3156240	3160360	We got to go to the lounge and they go to the lounge and they're like, it's 50 dollars extra.
3160360	3161120	But I'm a member.
3161160	3161400	Yeah.
3161400	3163440	You're a member to a club that lets you pay 50 dollars.
3163560	3166240	OK, and how much for my friends?
3166240	3166520	Yeah.
3166520	3168840	And then you go and there's no nowhere to sit.
3168840	3174960	And there's like crying babies are being dumped in the lounge fucking ducked in the
3174960	3175840	lounge colds.
3175840	3176120	Yeah.
3176120	3180840	In the lounge like you can see through a tinted window that the fucking regular ass poor
3180840	3183400	people seats are all empty because everyone wants to be in the lounge.
3183400	3184840	And I'm no exception.
3184840	3189360	I'm just like, well, is there is there is there a is there a package where I can strap
3189360	3194200	the babies to my feet and just like walk around on them and be more uncomfortable?
3194200	3196760	But more importantly, more important.
3197760	3204480	I'm a I'm a I'm a terrible person and I and I and I can't wait to get that fucking iPhone
3204480	3207640	X because the iPhone eight is for poor people.
3210280	3213320	Is the eight is the eight is the eight out?
3213760	3214200	Yeah.
3214200	3215880	Same time as the X.
3215880	3216440	Oh, OK.
3216440	3221760	There were they releasing the new phone for the poor people, which is only eighteen thousand
3221760	3225840	dollars because you're poor and you don't want to have it.
3225960	3227760	Let being poor slow you down.
3227760	3228800	Get a new iPhone.
3228800	3229840	Poor people phone.
3232800	3235880	And but then there's the real phone for me.
3235880	3238160	The twenty seven million dollar phone.
3238160	3239440	It doesn't have a home button.
3239440	3240840	They took the home button off, Eddie.
3241680	3245160	You know that I just the face my home button.
3245440	3247080	I don't like the home button either.
3247440	3248920	I don't like what I'm doing on my phone.
3248920	3249760	I want it gone.
3250360	3250800	Yeah.
3250800	3253640	It's every time I touch it, I have to swallow my vomit down.
3253640	3254840	I feel like a poor person.
3256560	3257920	Why am I touching a button?
3257920	3260840	What am I fucking like some kind of fucking refugee?
3261120	3261480	Yeah.
3266000	3267120	It's disgusting.
3267480	3272040	I want to I want to phone the only people in Aleppo have the eight.
3274400	3274920	Right.
3274920	3275320	Yeah.
3279400	3281240	Don't laugh too hard at that.
3282800	3283240	Right.
3284240	3284640	Yeah.
3284640	3288000	No, I'm looking forward to the new phone looking forward to the new.
3288000	3290680	Me and my family are looking forward to the new phone.
3290680	3294040	Every day I get up and you know my you asked me about my love life
3294040	3296560	and it centers around the iPhone coming out.
3297080	3300600	And you know, I'm like, honey, did it come out?
3300600	3302280	And she's like, not yet, baby.
3303880	3304920	Are you kidding or not?
3304920	3306680	I get why I am.
3307080	3307680	I am kidding.
3307680	3310360	But I so relate to you about the marketing of it.
3310480	3317000	Like, like I hardly fucking use anything on it except turn it on and go,
3317000	3321040	hello, what I am not an idiot.
3323240	3326600	But I'm always like, why are you calling me?
3326720	3330080	Whenever my phone rings, I'm like, what the fuck went wrong?
3330880	3334120	I know I swear three times a week.
3334120	3336200	I'm saying to somebody, how did you get this number?
3336920	3339320	It's a it's a it's stopped being a phone now.
3339320	3340200	It's pretty intense.
3340200	3342840	Like, I just use it to text an email.
3342840	3344160	I barely check my email now.
3344160	3346680	Now it's all text or absolutely go slack channel, whatever.
3346680	3350000	The phone rings and I'm like, you just who the fuck?
3350880	3351640	What are you doing?
3351640	3352320	Hello, Mr.
3352320	3355400	Herman, I just called about your medical procedure on Tuesday.
3355400	3357000	I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
3357000	3358400	I have an assistant.
3360560	3362800	Why are you calling me about medicine?
3364080	3366480	Lose this number, Marjorie.
3366600	3372640	But wait, wait, wait, fuck.
3372680	3376240	Face recognition is the phone recognizes your face.
3376600	3378840	Fucking good. Good.
3378840	3380680	I hope the phone recognizes everyone's face.
3380680	3383800	I hope I remember we were concerned about biometrics.
3384080	3385200	Where that goes? Never.
3385200	3387480	Remember when you remember when the sign of a true anarchist
3387480	3391960	is you were worried about products so concerned about biometrics?
3392480	3396280	You know, remember that that summer when we were all
3396840	3400280	like, biometrics, man.
3401440	3404640	I know, I know, you know, you're preaching to the pelicans now.
3405760	3407840	Fucking biometrics.
3407840	3413600	Those bio-ims are just really I can't even get up in the morning, man.
3415680	3419720	My fucking wife is getting down on me on her biometrics.
3419720	3420800	I'm like, baby, I don't know.
3420800	3424760	I can't even handle my own biometric, let alone yours.
3425240	3427440	I got another cigarette in this in these.
3429520	3435320	I'm up up to three packs a day, like, you know, because all these biometrics.
3436920	3439240	I'm not even talking to anybody right now.
3439920	3445080	I'm just sitting on the porch just talking to myself and smoking pencil.
3446880	3449880	Fucking biometrics, man, if it's not one thing, it's another.
3449880	3453040	If it's not one metric, it's another, man.
3453400	3455120	It's either biometrics,
3455120	3460320	neometrics, decometrics, octometrics.
3460520	3464240	These metrics are just fucking taking over, man.
3464440	3466120	They're taking my job.
3466120	3468280	They're taking my family.
3469080	3470680	Fucking biometrics.
3470680	3476640	Some candidates should come along and get rid of these biometrics.
3484040	3486720	But you grew you grew up kind of lower middle class, right?
3486720	3488800	Right. Peppertown.
3488800	3489920	You were no Ivy. Yes.
3489920	3491560	Lower, lower middle class.
3491560	3496920	Exactly. Both my parents were teachers in New York City.
3497760	3502760	And teachers, teachers, teachers,
3502760	3507200	cursory knowledge, school, school,
3507760	3511360	being bred for corporate culture.
3514040	3516440	No real learning anymore.
3516440	3518560	No philosophy.
3518560	3522680	Just you're being plugged in to a machine.
3523200	3525320	School.
3525320	3530360	But, yeah, I grew up as a lower middle class kid.
3531160	3533160	Did your parents beat you?
3535600	3542240	You know, my dad, my mom was extremely gentle.
3542480	3544080	My father's Sicilian.
3544080	3545320	So he had.
3545320	3549400	And it's true about the Sicilian, you know, he beat you if someone paid him.
3553840	3555600	Son, you didn't mow the lawn.
3555600	3558240	I'm going to beat the shit out of you as soon as I find someone that
3560120	3561240	wants me there.
3561240	3562960	Look at your report card.
3562960	3566160	If I get $50, your ass is mine.
3566160	3567360	Yeah.
3568880	3571120	Jimmy, three toes is coming down.
3571120	3572560	Jimmy, three toes.
3572560	3577200	Marvin, the the the ex ex the gun is coming down.
3577760	3579720	Oh, I'm going on another riff.
3579720	3581120	I was. No, no, no, I think we are.
3581120	3583120	This is the list of mafia guys.
3583120	3584520	Oh, no, he shook it. He shook it off.
3584520	3586440	OK, he's not going to do it.
3586440	3587640	I shake it off.
3587640	3592000	I always felt deprived, deprived about that, though, because my my Sicilian
3593320	3596200	family had no connections at all
3597480	3599720	to the coast of Nostra or the black.
3599720	3601960	I mean, that would have been a nice card for me to play.
3602480	3607160	I when I was getting my ass kicked in in school, like, hey, you touch me.
3607160	3609240	You're going to deal with the black hand, right?
3610800	3612680	Or some shit like that.
3612680	3615000	Did you hear? When's the last time you saw Godfather 2?
3615200	3617040	I am. I you did.
3617040	3619320	Oh, me. That's me telling the kids.
3619320	3620640	Oh, no. No, I'm sorry.
3620640	3623280	I was I just I just watch Godfather 2. Remember?
3624240	3627400	Robert De Niro plays Brando's character in Firefox.
3627480	3629480	And then and then they they walk you through.
3629640	3631280	He's just a regular guy. He's in New York.
3631280	3633440	And then there's this guy who's like the guy in the white coat.
3633440	3635480	You know, he's like Don Don Camusci. Oh, yeah.
3635480	3637080	It's like the guy he kills. Yeah. Yeah.
3637080	3642280	And then and then and then De Niro's like, oh, that guy who was with him?
3642280	3645680	And they're like and Bruno Kirby's like, this guy, I do.
3645680	3649880	The guy he owns, he owns everything, he owns everything.
3649880	3651680	And everything's like, oh, it's in his neighborhood.
3651680	3653600	Oh, it's everything. Oh, my man.
3653600	3657080	And then and then and then he's like, oh, I think I'll take care of it.
3657080	3658080	I'll take care of it.
3658080	3659880	And I'm like, what are you going to do that?
3659880	3661160	No one else can do what you do.
3661160	3663760	He's like, oh, trust me, I've got to go back.
3664480	3665960	And you're just like on the edge of your seat.
3665960	3668000	Like, wow, we're really watching like the origin.
3668000	3669240	We're watching the evolution.
3669240	3670160	I think it'd be funny.
3670160	3672240	I think it'd be funny if all Sicilians were like that
3672240	3674160	because my dad was a history teacher.
3674160	3676200	And it'd be funny if he taught class like that.
3676200	3680160	Look, the only thing I could tell you is that the Romans had their way.
3681560	3683760	And he just walked out of the fucking class.
3684640	3686440	They had their way.
3686440	3689640	They had their message.
3689640	3691360	Read up on the catapult.
3694760	3699600	But he Robert De Niro, as you may recall, as Brando in his youth,
3699600	3705120	the character Don Corleone, he he he climbs up on a roof.
3705120	3708400	Yes. And he walks across rooftops
3708400	3710960	so that he can get into the apartment building.
3710960	3712320	Yes. What was that about?
3712640	3718120	Of the of the mafia, Don, who holds little Italy in his iron grip
3718320	3721240	because of that kind of capish white thing he wears.
3721240	3722400	He has no bodyguards.
3722400	3723640	He doesn't hang out with anyone.
3723640	3725840	All he ever does is walk around and alienate everyone
3725840	3727240	and say that he owns the neighborhood.
3727240	3730880	Then he goes home to a one bedroom apartment in a dark stair landing
3730880	3733640	where you can access if you just go up on the roof.
3733640	3735680	Also, the front door would have worked.
3737440	3740000	And he wraps a towel around his hand with a gun.
3740000	3742880	And he goes like, hey.
3742880	3745120	And he's like, oh, no.
3745120	3748080	The one contingency for which I did not prepare.
3749960	3752240	He shot by arrival.
3752240	3755600	You found the black hands kryptonite and bang, bang.
3755680	3756760	Oh, I can't believe.
3756760	3758560	Well, who would have thought of this?
3758560	3760520	There's bullets in my body.
3760520	3765880	How did I ever? Oh, and then De Niro's character is like, now I'm the guy.
3767480	3769280	And everyone's like, can I have some money?
3769280	3771320	He's like, I don't have any.
3771320	3774920	Now, you know, the reason why De Niro kept becoming the guy
3774920	3777600	is because nobody could find a towel.
3779480	3782720	Very funny if you think about it.
3782720	3783440	It was cool, though.
3783440	3785800	The one thing that sticks out in your head is that the towel starts on fire.
3785800	3787600	Remember, he wraps it around.
3787600	3790440	Does it even work? Does that make a gunshot sound like less of a gun?
3790440	3793440	I use a pillow. I use a pillow.
3793440	3795640	Just usually a throat pillow.
3795640	3798680	I hate because I hate the sayings on throat, but it starts on fire.
3798680	3801480	And then he's like he's like whipping his hand around.
3801480	3802400	It's kind of cool.
3802400	3803600	Scorsese is a good director.
3803600	3805160	I'm not being real controversial there.
3805160	3807320	Yeah, Scorsese directed the shit out of that.
3808920	3812960	When he did Godfather 2, he's fucking nailed you.
3812960	3813400	He nailed you.
3813400	3817040	You know, when I think of his taxi driver, Godfather 2.
3817040	3818800	Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
3818800	3821760	Edit it, edit it out.
3821760	3825440	If you would have had the iPhone X, it would have saved you from that.
3826440	3828080	It'd be funny if that's what the 10 does.
3828080	3831360	It like interrupts you like you're about to say Scorsese.
3831360	3834560	And it just buzzes in your pocket.
3834560	3836600	And you look at it and it says, Coppola.
3836600	3839920	I can't even hear anybody over the sound of my fucking humiliation.
3839920	3842120	Coppola.
3842120	3843440	Really? Who gives a shit?
3843440	3846680	I don't know. It's what?
3846680	3848600	You don't know the Coppola directed Godfather 2?
3848600	3851560	Why are you doing a podcast?
3851560	3854680	People just have turned off around the country like,
3854680	3856120	turn it off, Margaret.
3856120	3858000	Yes, he said Scorsese.
3858000	3862800	Yes, he called us stupid idiots, but he got that trivia wrong.
3865520	3867080	I've had enough.
3867080	3873240	I've had enough to hear with this guy, not fact checking his his riffs.
3874160	3877800	It's not like I can fall back on my fidget spinner knowledge.
3879680	3881000	The fuck is a fidget spinner?
3881000	3883080	What is your fidget spinner knowledge?
3883080	3884000	No, I don't.
3884000	3884680	There are things.
3884680	3886920	Let's fall back on your fidget spinner knowledge.
3886920	3891840	So I just had about I don't have any fidget spinner.
3891840	3893400	You've got to know, you know what they are.
3893400	3896840	That's why I'm supposed to know Coppola from Scorsese
3896840	3900960	because I don't invest in fidget spinner information.
3900960	3903880	If I'm going to forget that Coppola is not Scorsese,
3903880	3906600	why am I not into Pokemon?
3906600	3908720	Oh, that tracks.
3908720	3910800	That tracks.
3910880	3915520	It's either current events or like curmudgeon guardian of nostalgia,
3915520	3916480	you know, I hear you.
3916480	3917080	What am I?
3917080	3919120	I'm a drifting fucking wraith.
3919120	3922960	Dude, what is going on with you tonight?
3922960	3923720	What happened?
3923720	3924840	Did something happen?
3924840	3926600	I mean, I'm concerned.
3926600	3927040	Nothing.
3927040	3928640	Is that what's happening?
3928640	3929520	Is it nothing new?
3929520	3929960	You're just.
3929960	3933760	Well, what you want to you think you think that all descents into darkness
3933760	3935880	have to have some simple.
3935880	3939920	Oh, a potato fell on my head while I was fighting Peach Dragon.
3939920	3944120	Yeah, what's your thing about descents into darkness, Rob?
3944120	3948760	You think it's that fucking simplistic?
3948760	3951120	I'm taking sides with you.
3951120	3954320	I wasn't here last weekend, and I was here the weekend before,
3954320	3958200	and you were delightful that weekend.
3958200	3961440	I think he's being I think he's delightful tonight.
3961440	3963040	He is delightful.
3966640	3969320	He just doesn't seem very happy right now, and I'm concerned.
3969320	3971720	I'm going through changes.
3971720	3973680	Why do we have to be happy all the time?
3973680	3974600	I don't get that.
3974600	3975240	It's true.
3975240	3977880	Yeah, didn't you see that movie with the memory islands
3977880	3980720	and the different colored marbles that represent the feelings?
3980720	3982320	Yeah.
3982320	3983680	Weren't you sad?
3983680	3984240	Right.
3984240	3985880	Yeah.
3985880	3988240	Sadness is a part of happiness.
3988240	3988760	Absolutely.
3988760	3990520	To be concerned.
3990520	3991040	What's that?
3991040	3994800	I don't think it's wrong to be concerned if somebody you care about
3994800	3995920	is not happy.
3995920	3998520	I was at Duncan's podcast, and I was like, yeah, I kind of bumped out.
3998640	3999040	I don't care.
3999040	4002360	He's like, well, that's because you got to just let eight people from Burning Man
4002360	4004600	live here, man.
4004600	4006400	And I was like, I'm not going to do that, you know?
4006400	4008680	Like, I'm not going to I'm not going to yes the end that suggestion.
4008680	4009840	I know that makes me a bad person.
4009840	4013000	I don't want a bunch of hippies living in my house.
4013000	4014360	Yeah, but that would make you happy.
4014360	4016920	But why not, man?
4016920	4022280	I don't because I'm evil because I'm evil.
4022280	4024320	I don't think that's evil.
4024320	4025320	I don't think that's evil.
4025320	4028080	I think it's evil.
4028080	4033240	I think it's evil not to let eight Burning Man people live in your house.
4033240	4039240	I mean, we all know that we do know that the solution is we have to stop.
4039240	4042360	Like, capitalism is killing us, and we have to stop.
4042360	4045360	And we have to have decentralized, non-hierarchical,
4045360	4047800	human-based societies.
4047800	4050720	I've known this forever.
4050720	4054040	But I'd say on that podcast, I'd go like, hey, capitalism sucks.
4054040	4057200	And then people on Reddit would go, then give all your money away.
4058240	4058920	Yeah, right.
4058920	4059320	Fuck you.
4059320	4060920	Fuck you.
4060920	4061840	You got me.
4061840	4062360	God damn it.
4062360	4063160	You got me.
4063160	4064200	I love my money.
4066240	4069800	Uh, yeah, yeah.
4069800	4071440	It's 9-11.
4071440	4072200	9-11.
4072200	4073120	It's 9-11.
4073120	4074400	I lived through, fuck it.
4074400	4075280	I was in New York.
4075280	4076200	So did I.
4076200	4077360	Yeah, you weren't there.
4077360	4078520	You pieces of shit.
4078520	4080160	I'm a man with a 9-11.
4080160	4085840	Bunch of LA people yelling about 9-11 when I lived through it.
4085840	4087000	9-11.
4087040	4088560	Oh, you mean you were in New York.
4088560	4089920	Yeah, I was right.
4089920	4090720	I was right.
4090720	4092280	That is a high road you could take.
4092280	4093760	That's what he did.
4093760	4095640	I thought you just assumed they were so young.
4095640	4098280	You were just like, you didn't fucking live through 9-11.
4098280	4099320	Oh, no, no, no.
4099320	4102760	They weren't there like I was there, you know?
4102760	4106520	I mean, I was in bed when it happened, but.
4106520	4107520	And my friend called.
4107520	4108280	But I was close.
4108280	4109840	I was close to it.
4109840	4110600	I was close to it.
4110600	4114680	I got up, and I lived in the village, and not to break.
4114760	4121800	And we watched the towers come down from his window.
4121800	4124760	He had an apartment looking straight at the towers,
4124760	4125280	you know?
4125280	4131120	David Cross said he could see people leaping.
4131120	4133320	That's something people don't talk about that.
4133320	4135840	But there was a lot of people jumping,
4135840	4138360	and they kind of just killed all footage of it,
4138360	4140360	and kind of was like, that didn't happen.
4140360	4141200	I can't even.
4141200	4145320	I mean, that has to be like the epitome of,
4145320	4146920	I don't even know what the word is.
4146920	4154120	It's just sort of like, you're watching a human being who
4154120	4156840	is identical to you.
4156840	4160040	And what you know about them on a fundamental level
4160040	4164120	is that they were in such pain and fear that they preferred.
4169360	4170840	I don't know why am I explaining this.
4171720	4173480	But it's just like, wow, holy shit.
4173480	4175600	Yeah, and they're yelling out, 9-11.
4175600	4180280	Well, it's been a few years, and we like to have fun.
4180280	4183280	You've been doing it for years.
4183280	4187360	9-11, people jump from bell dates.
4187360	4189120	Yeah, but where would we get as a society
4189120	4192320	if every time something was genuinely tragic or filled
4192320	4197960	with pathos, we paid it respect by avoiding it?
4197960	4199800	Let's all prove that we're polite.
4199800	4202240	Let's keep our elbows off the table, our feet off the table.
4202240	4203360	Let's not sit at the table.
4203360	4204760	Let's put the table in bronze.
4204760	4208640	All right, look, I'm not getting the analogy,
4208640	4213640	but no one's ever done that before.
4213640	4214520	You can do that?
4218840	4220240	You mean just saying?
4220240	4222320	You can just say it on the ground?
4222320	4223680	You can.
4223680	4224880	That's a move with Harmon?
4224880	4227440	You could just say, you're saying nonsense.
4227480	4230720	That's not a metaphor.
4230720	4233320	That's been an action this whole time.
4233320	4234520	It's like a one theft auto.
4234520	4237280	When you found out if you hit the bumper button,
4237280	4239640	you turned 180 degrees.
4239640	4240960	I was like, holy fuck, what?
4240960	4241960	I don't have to.
4241960	4243400	All right.
4243400	4246080	But what you're saying is true, and this country,
4246080	4248440	and the people of this country, and this audience
4248440	4255440	in particular, we have no memory of history in this country.
4255440	4257800	And that's why what's going on is going on.
4257800	4260400	There's no fucking, as a matter of fact,
4260400	4261800	Gorgvedal is one of my favorites.
4261800	4263280	You like Gorgvedal?
4263280	4265720	I fucking love Gorgvedal.
4265720	4268760	And you guys like Gorgvedal?
4268760	4269640	He's great.
4269640	4275240	And he wrote a book called The United Amnesia.
4275240	4278440	Damn it.
4278440	4281720	This is me forgetting to flush the toilet.
4281720	4283480	I love the guy who brings up Gorgvedal.
4283480	4285400	That book.
4285400	4287000	Something about amnesia.
4287000	4287920	Yeah.
4287920	4291160	I'm the biggest fan of Gorgvedal and his boo.
4295720	4296320	I believe you.
4296320	4297000	I believe.
4297000	4297600	I believe you.
4297600	4298200	I believe you.
4298200	4299280	Thank you for believing me.
4299280	4300360	I believe that you will.
4300360	4302920	United States of Amnesia, he called it.
4302920	4304640	And yeah, we don't remember.
4304640	4306800	Well, I think the biggest contributor to my bad mood
4306800	4312720	is that I have a, here's a weird thing about me.
4312720	4316640	I'm triggered by Nazis running in the street.
4316640	4319520	I have this crazy thing where I think
4319520	4325360	that it's better to be overreactive to Nazism.
4325360	4329360	Jump the gun, if you can, on that one.
4329360	4332000	Someone reminds you a little bit of Hitler.
4332000	4335360	Say it earlier.
4335360	4341560	Worst case scenario, you called someone Hitler too early.
4341560	4346600	Best case scenario, you stopped a Hitler.
4346600	4348160	Well, that is the scariest thing.
4348160	4351040	I mean, look at the silence about it.
4351040	4353000	It's unbelievable.
4353000	4356520	That's what's got me so grumpy lately.
4356520	4358680	So there's your answer, by the way.
4358680	4359640	I got it eventually.
4364160	4366160	I got off of Twitter the minute I started
4366160	4369000	seeing the anti-communist stuff.
4369000	4371600	When that became a meme, or whatever the fuck you call it,
4371600	4374520	that became a thought where it was like, oh, there's
4374520	4376240	a lot of anti-Nazi talk.
4376240	4379000	So now, I was just watching history repeat itself
4379000	4380960	of people going like, you know, communism's
4380960	4382960	responsible for even more debt.
4382960	4383440	I'm out.
4383440	4384720	I'm out.
4384720	4388080	I'm going to go, because if I keep listening to these kids,
4388080	4390000	I'm going to fucking kill myself.
4390000	4391040	And that's what they want.
4391040	4394600	So I'm going to live all over their asses.
4394600	4395360	They don't deserve.
4395360	4396560	Are you off of Twitter?
4396560	4397040	Yeah.
4397720	4400360	Because it's really great.
4400360	4401320	It's really great.
4401320	4404400	I love Twitter, especially lately.
4404400	4405080	I'm kidding.
4405080	4406080	I'm so kidding.
4406080	4407960	I was using it wrong.
4407960	4409600	I am healthier now.
4409600	4412000	I don't seem happier, but I am healthier.
4412000	4415360	Like, my sadnesses and angers are like real now.
4415360	4416760	I was using Twitter wrong.
4416760	4419240	I'm so glad that Lauren Duke is on it.
4419240	4420120	Just wack.
4420120	4422200	Sarah Thier, like, I feel like people
4422200	4424000	are like saving the world on Twitter.
4424920	4427000	But I can't use it right, you know?
4427000	4428000	Like, I can't.
4428000	4428600	Me neither.
4428600	4430320	I just sit there and read shit.
4430320	4431520	And I just, like, I fuck it.
4431520	4432800	My whole brain changes.
4432800	4434960	But I don't want to be one of these people that's like,
4434960	4436200	I don't want to deal with it.
4436200	4438080	Like, that's not good either.
4438080	4439680	Like, that's normalizing, right?
4439680	4441640	You're part of the problem.
4441640	4443920	I didn't know a fascist coup would
4443920	4446320	be aggravating or exhausting.
4446320	4447080	No, that it is.
4447080	4450520	I think I'll focus on my backyard garden.
4450520	4451360	That's an enemy.
4451360	4452320	That's what I've become.
4452320	4453480	That's what I am.
4453480	4454360	That's what I'm doing.
4454360	4457280	But at least if I own that, then maybe my backyard garden
4457280	4462920	will turn into a Hitler poison?
4462920	4465160	What's in your backyard garden?
4465160	4466040	What fruits?
4466040	4467080	Avocados.
4467080	4467560	I don't know.
4467560	4468080	Avocados?
4468080	4468680	Ask the dog sitter.
4468680	4469640	You have avocados?
4469640	4471680	I pay people to grow the backyard garden.
4474760	4475560	Anyways.
4475560	4476320	Yeah.
4476320	4477400	I really want to talk about it.
4477400	4479320	Well, just, you know, the reason why people, one
4479320	4483400	of the big reasons why people are so quiet about the fascism
4483400	4485600	that's taking over this country is because they're so,
4485600	4489720	I mean, we talked about the iPhone, you know, movies,
4489720	4492440	just constant tell, you know, fucking Netflix.
4492440	4496320	You know, people are much more interested in their Netflix
4496320	4500760	cues than they are in the country going down the shitter.
4500760	4502040	You know what I mean?
4502040	4504200	They're just so distracted by every fucking thing.
4504200	4507400	And Twitter is another one.
4507400	4510400	You know, they're just like, ugh.
4510400	4511400	They have no.
4511440	4514440	Yeah, but I don't, I mean, I definitely don't want to,
4514440	4517640	I don't think that the masses are being willfully,
4517640	4520640	cowardly, or stupid, or more in love with iPhones
4520640	4523040	than they are worrying about the fascist takeover
4523040	4523880	of the United States.
4523880	4527960	I give them at least enough credit that, oh no,
4527960	4530760	they're very, very interested in the fact
4530760	4533040	that we're being taken over.
4533040	4534680	But they don't do anything about it.
4534680	4536080	Thank you.
4536080	4539800	But they, I also, I mean, I have to look within myself
4539800	4541440	and I go like, are you exhausted?
4541440	4542320	Are you bored?
4542320	4545440	Are you fucking, like, are you, and I go, yes, I am.
4545440	4546360	Yes, I am.
4546360	4547800	And that's exactly what's happening.
4547800	4551440	It's like, oh, like, is somebody like tweets me
4552440	4555400	a month after November and says,
4555400	4559000	just get back to making you, you shit, you fucking faggot.
4560280	4562320	And like, and I'm sorry about that, by the way.
4562320	4563160	Ha ha ha!
4564440	4566520	A man who doesn't flush his toilet.
4567680	4569040	I have a lot of vices.
4570800	4574320	I was able for a, you know, okay, December.
4574320	4577320	I'm like, nice try, sucker.
4577320	4579520	Get back to work, indeed.
4579520	4580960	Get used to it.
4580960	4583040	None of us are getting back to what we do.
4583040	4584880	Get back to what you do.
4584880	4585720	America!
4587000	4588960	Another month, another month, another month goes by.
4588960	4591040	And it's like, it's not that I eventually was like,
4591040	4593280	man, I should really get back to making my cartoon.
4593280	4594360	It's not like I ever stopped.
4594360	4597360	It was just like, it was like, as I got,
4597360	4599600	I just fucking crashed.
4599600	4601880	And then one more person is like,
4601880	4604320	why don't you just shut the fuck up?
4604320	4608000	And I was like, you deserve me to shut the fuck up
4608000	4610800	because you're gonna fucking die without me to save you.
4614720	4615800	I see your,
4615800	4617640	pfft, pfft, pfft.
4617640	4621000	And I raise you a, who the fuck cares you were born?
4621000	4622920	I hate you!
4622920	4624000	Not you in the red shirt.
4624000	4625840	I'm not sure you didn't make the pfft sound.
4625840	4626880	Did you?
4627520	4628480	Piece of shit next to you?
4628480	4629320	No?
4629320	4630160	You?
4630160	4631280	Fuck you!
4631280	4632920	Stand up, face them!
4632920	4633760	What's your name?
4633760	4634600	Derek?
4634600	4635440	Boo!
4638080	4639760	Half cheers, half boos.
4639760	4640920	That's what you get.
4642400	4644000	This is like the end of the,
4644000	4645320	it's like the end of the,
4646600	4650120	Mark Wahlberg rock star movie, rock star.
4650120	4651600	I'm gonna slowly,
4651600	4653120	and then you start taking,
4653120	4655280	you take the microphone and I like go in the audience
4655280	4656840	and I'm like, hey!
4656840	4658800	And you can just join,
4658800	4662280	have a fun 20 years, you white piece of shit.
4664040	4666680	Have fun trying to figure out if you're a good person
4666680	4668720	by seeing how many people like you
4669640	4670960	on a fucking app.
4676160	4677800	Next week's episode,
4677800	4679680	I'm gonna kill myself on this stage.
4679680	4680760	Ha ha ha ha!
4680760	4681600	Are you?
4682600	4684720	Duncan Trussell will not let you do that.
4685920	4687400	He won't be here.
4690120	4691280	Me undies will be.
4692680	4694800	Warby Parker, Squarespace.
4694800	4696040	Oh yeah, Warby Parker.
4696040	4697760	We've planned, it's a pay-per-view event.
4700480	4701800	I am going to,
4703840	4705440	I'm gonna blow my brains out.
4706320	4707760	Can I back up your point?
4707760	4708920	What, what are you gonna back,
4708920	4710800	what, you, you want, you want a microphone
4711040	4714000	so you can, well, no, I like your,
4714000	4716400	I like your hesitance, you've earned a microphone.
4717400	4718880	This happens on this show.
4721840	4723320	Charlie, that's my name.
4724360	4727080	No, the disinterest of people
4727080	4729280	caring about the fact that Trump is president,
4729280	4731640	they've normalized it completely at this point.
4731640	4732960	Like, they don't care.
4732960	4734320	You gotta eat the mic.
4734320	4735160	Yeah, there you go.
4735160	4736000	All right, let me eat the mic.
4736000	4737400	No, you're doing it, great.
4737400	4739320	Yeah, they don't care.
4739320	4742000	It's been nine months.
4742000	4743560	They're over it.
4743560	4747680	And it seems to be the fact of the matter that
4749480	4752120	Hillary is old news, great, no one cares.
4752120	4754160	Bernie, Brows, still, fucking,
4754160	4756000	oh, he would've won, blah, blah, blah, great.
4756000	4757840	Thank you, DSA of Brooklyn, New York.
4757840	4759000	I appreciate you guys.
4760400	4764600	But no, I'm really sick of fucking people
4764600	4767200	acting like it's normal that we have a fucking reality
4767200	4770040	fucking TV star as president.
4770040	4771440	It's disgusting.
4771440	4775440	It represents us to the world in some weird fashion,
4775440	4777840	but it also should be like a wake-up call
4777840	4780080	for every fucking person out here
4780080	4783480	that there's nothing normal about the world we exist in
4783480	4786440	as United States of America.
4786440	4788760	I love you, Dan.
4788760	4790280	I appreciate Dan, too.
4790280	4791600	No, it's, I love you, why?
4791600	4794320	Oh, I thought his name was Dan, I'm sorry.
4794320	4795160	What was that?
4795160	4796000	I love you.
4797720	4799240	No, it fucking weirds me out.
4799240	4802640	And the fact that people can actually normalize that is.
4802640	4803680	I think people are scared.
4803680	4806880	They know how militarized the police are.
4806880	4809000	They know how militarized every, you know.
4809000	4809840	They're scared.
4809840	4811560	They just decided that we can,
4811560	4814560	Jeff Sessions just decided that they can sell fucking
4814560	4817960	military gear back to police forces now.
4817960	4820680	So we can have tanks, we can have fucking
4820680	4823200	bulletproof riot shields, we can have fucking
4823200	4826000	automatic weapons, it's fucking weird.
4826000	4828040	And like, no one wants to,
4829200	4831000	woke is a fucking weird word at this point,
4831000	4835800	but no one wants to understand that this is not normal.
4835800	4837840	And it stresses me out.
4837840	4838680	Yeah, I mean, I'm not.
4838680	4840720	It's woke up, shoebull.
4840720	4842760	No, no, none of that shit.
4842760	4844280	Get that shit out of my way.
4844280	4845120	Shoebull, oh God.
4845120	4847040	That's the thing, though, is like, I don't wanna,
4847040	4850560	it's not like, I think we're just used to a society
4850560	4852880	where actually being aware of shit,
4852880	4855800	like had its own momentum and a bunch of shit would get done.
4856520	4859600	If you kind of halfway thought that Stephen Colbert
4859600	4863240	was out of line on his last show or retweeted a hashtag,
4863240	4865920	like you might find out six weeks later, either A,
4865920	4867360	oh, that person wasn't worth any money
4867360	4868400	and they lost their job.
4868400	4869880	Or that person was Stephen Colbert,
4869880	4871680	so fuck you, your opinion didn't matter.
4871680	4875080	But like, it still felt like the momentum happened
4875080	4878720	just by you, like knowing shit, caring about shit,
4878720	4881240	being afraid of shit, not putting up with shit.
4881240	4885160	And we've entered a world where you can fucking not,
4885800	4887920	you could not put up with as much as you want.
4887920	4890720	You can care, you can feel, you can fear.
4890720	4893720	And actually, that just jiggles the jello.
4893720	4896680	It stays the same shape as it was.
4896680	4900040	And we're all reacting to that,
4900040	4901800	I don't even wanna say poorly.
4901800	4905780	Like, however we react, that's the right way to react
4905780	4908360	because all of us wanna get back to a system
4908360	4910840	or achieve a system where the way that we came out
4910840	4914040	of our mamas was like the right way to be,
4914080	4916360	that we didn't have to like mold ourselves
4916360	4918280	and socialize ourselves and be enforced
4918280	4921280	by some set of rules in order for us to get along
4921280	4922580	with some larger thing.
4922580	4925240	We all wanna get to a system that some of us felt
4925240	4926720	like we had where it was like, yeah,
4926720	4929600	but if you kind of yourself, like the truth will out
4929600	4931240	and all this stuff will happen.
4931240	4934040	And we're really like, we've come face to face
4934040	4936120	with a system where we're like, oh shit, you mean
4936120	4937560	I don't fucking matter at all?
4937560	4938840	I truly don't matter.
4938840	4940920	And then other people are going, welcome to the club,
4940920	4942280	that's how it felt for 20 years.
4942320	4944680	And we're like, fuck you, that offends me, ah.
4946040	4949000	And it makes me, like everyone else,
4949000	4951600	just want people to talk about Kmart
4951600	4955240	and Stephen King's it and all this shit.
4955240	4958920	And so, whereas initially it was the alt-right saying
4958920	4961280	everybody get back to work, or it was like rednecks
4961280	4963080	that were embarrassed that they voted for a guy
4963080	4965000	that turned out to actually mean it when he said
4965000	4966880	he wanted to build a wall, whereas they thought
4966880	4969640	he was actually just gonna like be fiscal or something.
4970640	4975640	Like now it's just everybody saying, I'm bored with this,
4976160	4978600	get back to work, entertain me, make jokes,
4978600	4979840	just talk about shit.
4979840	4983840	And I'm like, I feel you, the exact same time as I feel you.
4983840	4985360	I am as exhausted as you.
4985360	4989280	So now I'm getting back to work, I'm just being a clown.
4989280	4991680	I have nothing, I don't know what to do either.
4991680	4994080	I don't know who to vote for, what to do,
4994080	4996800	what pie to throw at what, what bandana to put on my face.
4996800	4998800	I don't know what to do.
4999000	5001200	I'm just gonna get back to my comedy podcast.
5001200	5002400	But guess what?
5002400	5005720	My comedy podcast was always me complaining
5005720	5008640	about how I don't understand what the fuck is going on
5008640	5009760	and everyone should leave me alone,
5009760	5011280	stop telling me to tie my shoes.
5011280	5014440	So now my fucking podcast really sucks.
5014440	5018960	Like beyond whatever you could imagine.
5018960	5020120	It's just like me going like,
5020120	5025120	I'm just collapsing in on myself like the star I always was.
5025120	5030120	And becoming a black hole from which all light can escape
5033000	5036120	because like it's a very low stakes black hole, but.
5037720	5040000	Low stakes black hole, my favorite punk band.
5040000	5040840	Yeah.
5042120	5043720	You asked me that earlier.
5043720	5044760	Yeah.
5044760	5046480	But my love life is good, yeah.
5048640	5052040	I'm married and we have pretty regular sex.
5053040	5055800	Whether I want it or not, that kind of thing.
5055800	5056800	Well, thank you.
5056800	5057640	Thank you, Charlie.
5057640	5058880	That was great, man.
5061280	5064480	Shout out Chappo Trap House.
5064480	5067080	Check that out if you don't like the world that you're living in.
5067080	5068080	Right, Chappo.
5068080	5070400	I think we might get something from Chappo on the...
5070400	5073600	Also, Harmiquest, check it out if you don't like the world you're living in.
5076000	5077000	Yeah.
5077000	5079480	Or if the world you live in doesn't smell, right?
5079480	5080480	Fulton and Roark.
5080480	5083120	Fulton and Roark, for all of your solid...
5083120	5087680	Solid cologne needs wax-based colognes and perfumes for men.
5087680	5090760	Travel safe perfumes that won't break in your luggage.
5090760	5094480	And they smell great, come in one of 14 different flavors.
5095640	5096480	Are you...
5096480	5097320	Scents.
5097320	5098760	What are the 14 flavors?
5098760	5099600	Lemon.
5099600	5101680	Are you still performing here?
5101680	5102680	Peppermint.
5102680	5104640	Can people buy tickets to come see you performing?
5104640	5106200	Rosemary.
5106200	5107680	Sorry.
5107680	5109680	I missed it, can you start over?
5111480	5112480	What, Dan?
5113480	5115480	Are you still doing shows here?
5115480	5118480	Yeah, I have two more Wednesdays here, the 20th and the 27th.
5118480	5122480	So go to starburnscastle.com, is that the radio?
5122480	5124480	That's right, I think starburnscastle.com.
5124480	5126480	Certainly Google starburnscastle.
5126480	5128480	Get tickets to Pepitone, he's not gonna let you down.
5128480	5135480	This is a guy who, just when you think you might be witness to something awful,
5135480	5138480	that's when Pepitone fucking fires up like the Hulk.
5138480	5139480	That's right, that's right.
5140480	5143480	This was just the tip of the iceberg tonight.
5143480	5145480	Sorry about the bidet stuff.
5146480	5148480	No, but you truly are amazing.
5148480	5149480	I apologize.
5149480	5150480	I apologize.
5150480	5151480	It's good.
5151480	5156480	I would recommend it to anybody, because it's almost...
5156480	5158480	Yeah, I really mean that.
5158480	5159480	Thank you.
5159480	5160480	I really very much respect you.
5160480	5161480	Thank you.
5161480	5164480	Pepitone is a bidet, my ass is spotless.
5165480	5170480	He does it, he immediately revealed he has no bidet opinions.
5170480	5172480	He's just like me, he just wants people to like him.
5172480	5174480	It's like a bidet opinions, who cares, right?
5174480	5176480	You don't care if anyone has a shit hanging out of their ass.
5176480	5180480	No, I just get anxious, I get anxious about a jet of water hitting me.
5180480	5181480	I do too.
5184480	5185480	I'm like...
5185480	5186480	You walk through the fear.
5186480	5188480	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5188480	5190480	Or sit through the fear, whatever it is.
5190480	5195480	Is there anything else because you donated your time and energy to us that you want to plug?
5195480	5201480	I'm doing a show dovetailing into collapsing as a star.
5201480	5204480	I'm doing a show, it's a one man show.
5204480	5206480	It's about how I wasn't loved.
5206480	5207480	No, kidding.
5207480	5209480	I'm doing a one man show called End of Days.
5209480	5216480	And it's a bunch of characters dealing with kind of, you know, this stuff.
5216480	5217480	Where's that?
5217480	5221480	I'm going to first do it in Santa Barbara and then I'm going to find a space here.
5221480	5225480	I like to announce things before I even have a space for it.
5225480	5227480	So you can't go...
5227480	5229480	And that's the way to do it, isn't that right?
5229480	5231480	Yeah, that's the way to do it.
5235480	5238480	He's a good controller, he's a good controller.
5238480	5241480	So in your one man show, did I hear right?
5241480	5246480	You fight the devil at the end with a rocket launcher, is that true?
5246480	5248480	Is that true?
5248480	5250480	You son of a bitch, don't you ruin it.
5250480	5252480	Oh, sorry.
5252480	5254480	It's called what?
5254480	5259480	We'll keep our eyes peeled for where to get tickets to them.
5259480	5262480	Keep your eyes really peeled.
5262480	5267480	I don't know when it's going to be anywhere.
5269480	5271480	Look at that, look at that.
5271480	5273480	Isn't that great?
5274480	5277480	One of the greatest mimes of our time.
5277480	5280480	Let's thank Eddie Pepitone for joining us today.
5280480	5282480	Eddie!
5282480	5284480	Eddie!
5285480	5287480	I love this guy.
5287480	5289480	I love this guy.
5289480	5291480	I'm so glad you had him on the show tonight.
5291480	5292480	Oh wow.
5292480	5294480	He's great, I love Eddie.
5294480	5296480	Keep your eyes peeled has always...
5296480	5299480	Doesn't that expression actually gross you out?
5300480	5306480	When I was a kid I would picture a potato peeler and an eyeball.
5306480	5309480	Yeah, welcome to my world.
5309480	5312480	That would not make you see better.
5313480	5316480	I'm just saying they should stop saying that.
5316480	5318480	It doesn't work.
5318480	5319480	Nobody really does.
5319480	5321480	I think it's like a Beverly Hillbillies thing.
5321480	5323480	Who actually says keep your eyes peeled?
5323480	5326480	We just did.
5326480	5327480	Recently.
5327480	5329480	We say good looking out now.
5329480	5331480	Good looking out.
5331480	5332480	Oh yeah.
5332480	5333480	What?
5333480	5336480	That's what you sound like to me.
5336480	5339480	What?
5339480	5341480	I don't know I'm making it up.
5341480	5346480	I get on a stage for two hours and talk into a microphone.
5346480	5349480	Incredulity isn't an option for you.
5349480	5352480	You could never be surprised by anything I say.
5352480	5353480	You could never make a video.
5353480	5354480	What are you saying?
5354480	5355480	What's happening?
5355480	5356480	What's going on?
5356480	5358480	Oh, well, I'll tell you.
5358480	5360480	I came up and I started talking.
5360480	5362480	I don't know what I'm saying.
5362480	5363480	Sneaker.
5369480	5371480	Shut up!
5372480	5376480	We should maybe try to transition you back onto Twitter.
5377480	5379480	Just see what happens.
5379480	5381480	It may have been useful.
5381480	5382480	No, I'm sorry.
5382480	5384480	I was doing a bit.
5384480	5385480	No, it was great.
5385480	5390480	Steve Levy, are you here?
5390480	5392480	He's hiding in the corner.
5392480	5393480	He'll be here.
5393480	5395480	I said, Steve Levy, are you here?
5395480	5398480	And he's still sitting with his legs stretched out.
5398480	5401480	And he shrugged and was like, yeah, I'm here.
5401480	5405480	I mean, why do you think I asked the question?
5406480	5408480	Whoa!
5414480	5415480	Sorry.
5415480	5416480	It's okay.
5416480	5417480	Maybe I would have...
5417480	5419480	You know what I might have done?
5419480	5420480	That's dumb, Steve.
5420480	5421480	What the fuck?
5421480	5422480	No.
5422480	5423480	I think I understand.
5423480	5425480	In his defense, I might have been about to say,
5425480	5426480	Steve Levy, are you here?
5426480	5429480	I wanted to let you know Duncan texted me while I was up here.
5429480	5432480	The reason he didn't show up was because no one ever contacted him.
5432480	5433480	Oh.
5434480	5439480	That's the kind of thing that Steve would like to hear standing up, I think.
5440480	5443480	But I don't know if I made it clear to you that maybe you should contact him.
5443480	5444480	I don't know.
5444480	5446480	All you said was he's booked.
5446480	5447480	I didn't say he's booked.
5447480	5448480	I never said those words.
5448480	5449480	Well, you said he's coming.
5449480	5451480	I said Duncan wants to do the podcast.
5451480	5452480	I did not say he's booked.
5452480	5453480	I don't know.
5453480	5456480	I don't remember the words exactly.
5456480	5459480	Take another Valium.
5460480	5461480	Hi.
5461480	5462480	Hi, Rob.
5462480	5463480	What are you doing?
5463480	5466480	Rob, I really love your shirt.
5469480	5470480	It's amazing.
5470480	5473480	This is the part of the show where you stand next to the podium.
5473480	5478480	I stand during D&D because my ass falls asleep on these torture chairs.
5480480	5482480	Rob, are you wearing pajamas?
5482480	5484480	Just the lower half.
5484480	5485480	Oh.
5485480	5486480	I love it.
5486480	5487480	I like how you pronounce it.
5487480	5489480	Are you wearing pajamas?
5489480	5491480	Rob, are you wearing pajamas?
5492480	5493480	Excuse me.
5493480	5498480	Are you wearing flavor crystals in my class?
5499480	5503480	Nobody believes me, but I was this close.
5503480	5506480	Every once in a while, I think about wearing my pajamas to the show
5506480	5510480	because I'm in my pajamas, and tonight was one of those nights.
5510480	5513480	And I was like, eh, put up pants.
5513480	5514480	I would have been crazy.
5514480	5515480	Yeah.
5515480	5516480	Pajama bros.
5516480	5518480	There would have been two people in pajamas up here.
5518480	5519480	Yeah.
5519480	5521480	Two grown boys.
5523480	5526480	You know, I used to say if you could make it through the whole day
5526480	5529480	without taking your pajamas off, you're a pajampeon.
5530480	5531480	You're a what?
5531480	5532480	A pajampeon.
5532480	5534480	A pajamian?
5534480	5535480	A pajampeon.
5535480	5536480	A pajamian.
5536480	5538480	A pajampeon.
5538480	5539480	It's like champion.
5539480	5540480	A pajampeon.
5540480	5541480	Pajampeon.
5541480	5542480	A pajampeon.
5542480	5543480	What did I say?
5543480	5544480	Pajamion.
5544480	5547480	You kept leaving the most explosive letter out.
5548480	5551480	And also the most champion defining letter.
5551480	5552480	Right.
5552480	5553480	Pajamion.
5553480	5554480	Right.
5554480	5555480	Okay.
5555480	5556480	So you said pajampeon.
5556480	5557480	Pajampeon.
5557480	5558480	Pajampeon.
5558480	5559480	You said that.
5559480	5560480	P-H-P.
5560480	5561480	That's what you said.
5561480	5562480	Yes.
5562480	5563480	And I said what?
5563480	5564480	Pajamion.
5564480	5565480	Oh, that's terrible.
5565480	5566480	Oh my God.
5566480	5568480	How embarrassing for me.
5569480	5572480	And high five to you with what?
5572480	5574480	How you pronounced it.
5574480	5576480	That is my word.
5576480	5577480	I know.
5577480	5583480	It's your word and it is clearly better than the way I pronounced it when I asked you what
5583480	5584480	you just said.
5584480	5585480	That is so much better.
5585480	5586480	It's good.
5586480	5587480	No.
5587480	5588480	I'm on your side on this one.
5588480	5589480	That's great.
5589480	5590480	No, no, no.
5590480	5591480	I'm great.
5591480	5594480	Steve, tell me you're a pajamian.
5594480	5595480	Tell me.
5595480	5597480	I'm a pajamian.
5597480	5602480	Oh, you must be from a country called pajama, a planet.
5602480	5604480	Spencer, tell me you're a pajampeon.
5604480	5605480	I'm a pajampeon.
5605480	5608480	Oh, you mean you won a contest involving pajamas?
5608480	5610480	Of course.
5610480	5611480	What contest?
5611480	5613480	It all comes down to that P.
5613480	5614480	What contest?
5614480	5615480	I don't know.
5615480	5616480	There was a contest?
5616480	5617480	It's fucking like inferred.
5617480	5618480	There's a contest.
5618480	5622880	I couldn't hear what you were saying, so I repeated something that I thought you said.
5622880	5626480	I wasn't trying to nail it.
5626480	5628480	I wasn't trying to nail it, Dan.
5628480	5630480	I was trying to nail it.
5630480	5632480	I was going, what did you just say?
5632480	5633480	Did you just say this?
5633480	5634480	And you're like...
5634480	5638480	And I'm like, oh, okay.
5638480	5641480	Sorry, question.
5641480	5646480	They all float down here.
5646480	5649480	Is the new it movie in theaters?
5649480	5650480	Oh, yeah.
5650480	5651480	How's it...
5651480	5654480	It's the number one movie at the box.
5654480	5656480	It's a huge movie.
5656480	5657480	It's a huge hit.
5657480	5661480	The little boys don't fuck the little girl in the movie.
5661480	5662480	No, no, no.
5662480	5668480	Well, then count me out.
5668480	5673480	You'll get my money when you do a proper adaptation.
5673480	5676480	Where is the lysine dependency?
5676480	5679480	Jurassic Park.
5679480	5685480	Yeah, yeah.
5685480	5686480	All right.
5686480	5687480	Well, let's...
5687480	5688480	Pajamian.
5688480	5689480	I'm a pajamian.
5689480	5690480	You know something?
5690480	5694480	I like my way better.
5694480	5695480	Pajamian.
5695480	5698480	I am a pajamian.
5698480	5699480	I like it.
5699480	5700480	It's mine.
5700480	5702480	I pronounced it my way.
5702480	5703480	I like it.
5703480	5704480	It sounds better.
5704480	5708480	Yeah, it sounds like you're a citizen of the realm of pajama.
5708480	5709480	Yeah, yeah.
5709480	5710480	I love it.
5710480	5711480	No, it's great.
5711480	5712480	I love it.
5712480	5713480	It's all a totally different concept.
5713480	5714480	I love it.
5714480	5715480	It's...
5715480	5717480	I didn't know what a pajamian was.
5717480	5718480	Pajam-pian.
5718480	5721480	Not pajam-pian.
5721480	5723480	Pajam-pian.
5723480	5725480	P-A-J-A-M-P-I-O-N.
5725480	5726480	What did I say?
5726480	5729480	I said the exact same thing that you just said.
5729480	5730480	Pajam-pian.
5730480	5732480	I said the same thing.
5732480	5734480	It sounds exactly the same thing.
5734480	5737480	And I understood what you meant.
5737480	5740480	I knew what you meant.
5740480	5750480	Shrab, when we were... in our 20s, told me that he thought that the word utensil was
5750480	5754480	invented by smart people to make him feel stupid.
5754480	5758480	Because the way he had heard the word is people would say, do you have a writing utensil?
5758480	5761480	And he would say, why can't you just say a pen?
5761480	5765480	And I would say, because they might want a pen...
5765480	5771480	If you have a pencil in your pocket, then they might be cheating themselves out of a
5771480	5774480	pencil opportunity if all they want is a writing utensil.
5774480	5777480	Then why can't you just say pencil or pen?
5777480	5778480	You know what?
5778480	5780480	Language is a living thing.
5780480	5785480	When was... when did you say when we were... how old?
5785480	5786480	When we were in our what?
5786480	5787480	20s.
5787480	5788480	20 years ago.
5788480	5789480	Oh, okay.
5789480	5790480	And we're in our what now?
5790480	5791480	Oh, dude.
5791480	5792480	Oh, so...
5792480	5793480	You haven't changed.
5793480	5794480	That's my point.
5794480	5795480	It was a while ago.
5795480	5796480	You haven't changed.
5796480	5797480	It was a while ago.
5797480	5798480	You haven't changed.
5798480	5799480	I had the utensil argument recently.
5799480	5801480	You... it's a pajimpian thing.
5801480	5802480	You're doing the same thing.
5802480	5803480	Why do you think I brought it up?
5803480	5806480	I'm just like trying to like...
5806480	5807480	You're made up word?
5807480	5810480	It's the same thing as your utensil thing.
5810480	5812480	You're made up word?
5812480	5813480	It's the same thing.
5813480	5814480	You're made up word?
5814480	5815480	It's the same thing.
5815480	5819480	The word you made up that you were so proud of?
5819480	5820480	It's the same thing.
5820480	5825480	Your proud made up word is the same as utensil in our 40s.
5825480	5827480	You haven't changed because...
5827480	5831480	I've changed so much.
5831480	5832480	You've changed in one way.
5832480	5833480	You don't know.
5833480	5837480	The only way you've changed is you started focusing on your butt.
5837480	5841480	Like you... you... you didn't... back then that guy...
5841480	5843480	like he would have been like, what's a bidet?
5843480	5845480	But now you're like, oh, get that.
5845480	5848480	Yeah, that's it.
5848480	5850480	Back then...
5850480	5854480	And you found... you got married and... you know...
5854480	5856480	That was... that was nice.
5856480	5858480	Yeah.
5858480	5861480	Still is.
5861480	5864480	You're a little... you're less competitive too.
5864480	5869480	I was never competitive. I hate competition.
5869480	5870480	He was competitive.
5870480	5872480	When? With what?
5872480	5874480	When you were 20. With everything.
5874480	5875480	With what?
5875480	5877480	When I was 20?
5877480	5882480	What? What are you trying to win this conversation?
5882480	5884480	Can we just...
5884480	5886480	I... what?
5886480	5888480	I thought you guys were like...
5888480	5891480	I thought you guys were trying to send a signal like...
5891480	5893480	you don't want to do that.
5893480	5894480	No, dude.
5894480	5896480	Like they say 9-11 and then we wrap up with the guest.
5896480	5897480	You know, we got...
5897480	5898480	Right.
5898480	5899480	No, I get it.
5899480	5900480	We got a solid 19 minutes.
5900480	5901480	Signal of what?
5901480	5903480	I just thought Rob was trying to filibuster and stuff.
5903480	5904480	Filibuster?
5904480	5905480	What are you talking about?
5905480	5906480	What's happening?
5906480	5907480	Everyone's favorite part of the show.
5907480	5909480	He thinks you hate D&D.
5909480	5911480	Rob hates games. There's no...
5911480	5912480	I hate games.
5912480	5913480	That's no secret.
5913480	5915480	I hate competition.
5915480	5921480	I think it makes... it turns... good people bad.
5921480	5922480	What's this?
5922480	5924480	What are you doing? That's not my name.
5925480	5936480	All right, here we go.
5936480	5938480	No glasses.
5951480	5953480	Rob, I hope you never change.
5955480	5956480	He doesn't.
5958480	5960480	You like me, right?
5960480	5962480	Yeah, I think you're great. I love you.
5962480	5963480	Yeah, I like you too.
5968480	5970480	That doesn't surprise me at all.
5971480	5972480	Could have guessed that.
5972480	5975480	I know you're big fans of his.
5975480	5976480	Don't like you.
5976480	5977480	Don't like him.
5977480	5978480	I get it.
5978480	5979480	You do.
5979480	5980480	It's like if you went to Batman and said,
5980480	5982480	you know the Riddler and the Joker are teaming up,
5982480	5983480	Batman would be like,
5983480	5984480	yeah, doi.
5985480	5987480	Doesn't change a thing about life in Gotham
5987480	5988480	for this dark night.
5988480	5989480	You like me.
5990480	5991480	Stop doing that.
5991480	5992480	I'll still be down in my basement
5992480	5993480	analyzing perfume.
5995480	5998480	Man, if Joker and the Riddler teamed up,
5998480	6001480	it would be confusing because you're like,
6001480	6003480	is this a Riddler or is this a joke?
6003480	6005480	Thank you. Thank you.
6006480	6007480	Thank you.
6008480	6010480	I think DC is currently exploring it,
6010480	6012480	but Batman's in the middle and has to choose his side
6012480	6014480	between the Riddler and the Joker.
6014480	6016480	They're pinned against each other.
6016480	6017480	Yeah.
6017480	6020480	I mean, you know the Joker's like, come on.
6020480	6022480	And the Riddler's like, what?
6022480	6025480	And the Joker's like, Riddler?
6025480	6026480	And he's like, what?
6026480	6028480	It's a kind of joke.
6028480	6029480	No, it's not.
6029480	6031480	No, it's so dumb.
6031480	6033480	It's more like a test question.
6034480	6035480	They should change it.
6036480	6037480	They should change it.
6037480	6040480	Because if they fixed it, it would be famous.
6043480	6044480	They should.
6044480	6045480	You should.
6045480	6046480	You should.
6046480	6047480	You should.
6047480	6049480	You should write them to fix it before.
6049480	6053480	Before another movie or a millionth comic book comes out
6053480	6054480	or action figure.
6054480	6055480	They should.
6055480	6056480	God.
6056480	6057480	Okay.
6057480	6058480	You're right.
6058480	6059480	We should fix that.
6059480	6060480	Yeah.
6060480	6061480	We should fix that.
6061480	6062480	Can I sum up your argument?
6062480	6063480	We should fix that.
6063480	6064480	Then we'll be famous.
6064480	6065480	Yeah.
6065480	6066480	This is you.
6066480	6068480	So in other words, we're talking about it.
6068480	6069480	That's your argument.
6069480	6070480	We're talking about it.
6070480	6071480	What?
6071480	6072480	What's my argument?
6072480	6073480	You turned into your mother.
6073480	6074480	Hey, Zach.
6074480	6075480	You got that D&D music.
6075480	6076480	Yeah, yeah.
6076480	6077480	I don't think they have that.
6077480	6078480	Yeah, they do.
6078480	6079480	No way.
6079480	6080480	You ready, Spence, for that recap from last week?
6080480	6081480	No.
6081480	6082480	No.
6082480	6083480	Somebody.
6083480	6084480	Somebody take control here.
6084480	6085480	That's what you guys were doing.
6085480	6086480	All right.
6086480	6087480	I miss Jeff.
6087480	6088480	I miss Jeff.
6088480	6089480	Last time.
6089480	6090480	I miss our friendship.
6090480	6091480	I miss you.
6091480	6092480	I miss you.
6092480	6093480	I miss you.
6093480	6094480	I miss you.
6094480	6095480	I miss you.
6095480	6096480	I miss you.
6096480	6097480	I miss you.
6097480	6098480	I miss our friendship.
6098480	6104480	This is why I didn't want to start the D&D.
6104480	6108160	We could just keep this going.
6108160	6109680	Last time.
6109680	6113640	Turned out the Banditos were assassins.
6113640	6115640	That was it.
6115640	6117640	Really?
6117640	6120480	I mean, nothing happened.
6120480	6124040	We chased down the Banditos.
6124040	6125480	Seemed like they were assassins.
6125480	6126480	Right.
6127480	6128480	But we lost the Banditos.
6128480	6131480	But really specifically, were we chasing them?
6131480	6132480	Yeah.
6132480	6133480	No.
6133480	6137480	What happened is, Patchens was like, oh, man, there's this relic I was supposed to be guarding.
6137480	6140480	It was the most perfect jewel they'd ever seen.
6140480	6142480	And it got stolen.
6142480	6145480	And then you're like, don't you worry, Patchens.
6145480	6146480	Right.
6146480	6147480	That's all.
6147480	6148480	Yeah.
6148480	6149480	We got to go get those Banditos.
6149480	6152480	Got to go check that out.
6152480	6155480	How many Banditos were left?
6156480	6158480	There's two that are dead.
6158480	6161480	So there's maybe four or five.
6161480	6162480	Fuck.
6162480	6163480	That went off.
6163480	6164480	Which way they went?
6164480	6165480	I just woke up out of a dream.
6165480	6167480	Did they all head in one direction?
6167480	6168480	Yeah.
6168480	6170480	They headed to the north.
6170480	6172480	Who's the fastest?
6172480	6175480	That would be me.
6175480	6181480	I start running as fast as I can.
6181480	6184480	I got a speed of 20.
6184480	6185480	I'm running 20.
6185480	6186480	Not the fastest.
6186480	6188480	I'm running full 20.
6188480	6189480	I'm running full 20.
6189480	6193480	Chad, I'm running full 20.
6193480	6195480	You guys can't even see my legs move.
6195480	6196480	All right.
6196480	6197480	Yeah.
6197480	6198480	Chad's running.
6198480	6199480	20.
6199480	6200480	Oh, yeah.
6200480	6201480	No, I know.
6201480	6203480	You got to roll on that shit.
6203480	6204480	No.
6204480	6206480	You run 20.
6206480	6207480	That's just what happens.
6207480	6209480	There's no rolling.
6209480	6211480	I'd like to run 30.
6211480	6212480	30.
6212480	6213480	You can't.
6213480	6216480	You can't do that.
6216480	6218480	He's very competitive.
6218480	6219480	Yeah.
6219480	6220480	Where are you going?
6220480	6221480	Where are you guys going?
6221480	6222480	North.
6222480	6223480	Yeah.
6223480	6224480	We're running north.
6224480	6225480	Don't just say north.
6225480	6226480	Follow the Banditos.
6226480	6228480	Where are the Banditos going?
6228480	6230480	No, that's the direction they went.
6230480	6231480	Is it?
6231480	6232480	What?
6232480	6233480	I don't know.
6233480	6234480	Uh-oh.
6234480	6235480	I thought you said...
6235480	6236480	No, I did say north.
6236480	6237480	I just want to be clear.
6237480	6238480	You just say you're running.
6238480	6240480	It doesn't make any sense.
6240480	6241480	All right.
6241480	6242480	You're running.
6242480	6243480	Yeah.
6243480	6244480	But it's been like...
6244480	6245480	It's been a lot of time.
6245480	6246480	Well, that's not our fault.
6246480	6247480	We would...
6247480	6248480	That's...
6248480	6249480	Well...
6249480	6250480	Yeah.
6250480	6251480	Yeah.
6251480	6252480	Time goes whether or not we...
6252480	6253480	Okay, because we had a conversation about what...
6253480	6254480	Yes.
6254480	6255480	You're right.
6255480	6256480	You're like, yeah, I know we can't see them.
6256480	6257480	Right.
6257480	6258480	So you're just running.
6258480	6259480	All right.
6259480	6260480	Yeah.
6260480	6261480	You keep running.
6261480	6262480	Is Patches with us?
6262480	6263480	Two people ran off.
6263480	6264480	Uh, no.
6264480	6265480	Patches is with Dan, who hasn't started running as far as I was.
6265480	6266480	Yeah, Dan.
6266480	6267480	You got to start running.
6267480	6268480	I got to start running.
6268480	6269480	I got to take care of Patches.
6269480	6270480	I'm a cleric.
6270480	6271480	You guys go chase the Banditos.
6272480	6273480	That's good.
6274480	6275480	That's what I wanted.
6276480	6277480	Chad, maybe we should turn back.
6277480	6279480	I just started running because I wanted to show I was faster than you.
6279480	6280480	Hey, fuck that guy.
6280480	6281480	You do.
6281480	6282480	Yeah, you catch up with him.
6282480	6283480	Yeah.
6283480	6284480	Are you overtaking me then?
6284480	6285480	Hey!
6286480	6287480	Yeah.
6289480	6290480	All right.
6290480	6294480	You see another one of these Banditos, except he's lying on the floor and he seems to be
6294480	6295480	cut in half.
6295480	6296480	What the fuck?
6296480	6297480	Hey, are you okay?
6298480	6301480	He doesn't answer.
6302480	6304480	I give him a good shake.
6305480	6306480	He doesn't answer.
6306480	6307480	The top half.
6307480	6308480	The top half.
6309480	6310480	Hey!
6310480	6311480	Hey!
6311480	6312480	Buddy, wake up!
6312480	6313480	Wake up!
6314480	6315480	Who did this to you?
6316480	6317480	Who did this to you?
6319480	6320480	Who did this to you?
6320480	6322480	I ran here as fast as I could.
6322480	6323480	Who did this to you?
6324480	6325480	And that's saying a lot.
6326480	6327480	Yeah.
6327480	6328480	Who did this to you?
6328480	6329480	He doesn't answer.
6329480	6330480	I shake the bottom half.
6334480	6335480	Yeah.
6335480	6336480	It doesn't happen.
6336480	6337480	Nothing happens.
6337480	6338480	I searched the corpse.
6338480	6339480	All right.
6339480	6344480	He's got a sharp dagger and he's got the same stuff as the other guy.
6344480	6345480	He's got a sharp dagger.
6345480	6346480	He's got a sword.
6346480	6348480	He's got a poison pill and he's got this armor.
6348480	6350480	I'll keep the poison pill.
6350480	6351480	Yeah.
6351480	6352480	Just in case.
6353480	6356480	I take a dagger.
6357480	6358480	Okay.
6359480	6362480	But I don't let Steve's character know.
6362480	6363480	I'm trying.
6364480	6366480	I can't remember how Patchen's is, what his condition is.
6366480	6367480	Is he stabilized?
6367480	6368480	Yeah.
6368480	6370480	He's fine, but he's wounded.
6370480	6371480	All right.
6371480	6372480	And in pain.
6372480	6373480	Then I'll let them...
6374480	6375480	Hey!
6376480	6377480	Hey!
6378480	6381480	Hey, we found this guy over here!
6381480	6382480	Can I hear them?
6382480	6383480	Can I hear him?
6384480	6385480	Yeah.
6387480	6389480	You found a Bandito?
6390480	6392480	Yeah, in half!
6397480	6399480	Steve took his poison!
6406480	6408480	Where are you?
6409480	6411480	I'm with Patchen's.
6412480	6414480	You found him in ham?
6414480	6415480	Ham!
6416480	6417480	There's an F.
6417480	6418480	Half.
6418480	6419480	Half.
6419480	6420480	He's cutting the F.
6420480	6422480	We found him that way.
6423480	6425480	Are there more?
6425480	6426480	Habs?
6430480	6432480	There's the two so far.
6433480	6437480	The top, half, and the bottom half.
6439480	6441480	But we'll keep looking!
6453480	6456480	You have to find Patchen's gem!
6457480	6458480	His gem?!
6460480	6461480	Is that something Patchen's?
6461480	6462480	What was it?
6462480	6464480	It was like a gem, yeah.
6465480	6466480	Look for a gem!
6467480	6468480	Gem?!
6469480	6470480	A gem?!
6471480	6472480	Gem?!
6473480	6474480	Well, okay.
6474480	6475480	We'll look for it.
6476480	6478480	We searched the area for the gem.
6478480	6479480	Can you find it?
6479480	6480480	You don't find it.
6480480	6482480	Can you find any gem?
6482480	6483480	It's not there.
6484480	6486480	It's just a dead guy.
6487480	6488480	Wait a minute.
6488480	6489480	Wait a minute.
6489480	6491480	I forgot a thing from last week.
6492480	6493480	These aren't real Banditos.
6493480	6495480	These aren't real Banditos!
6495480	6496480	What?!
6497480	6499480	They were sent by somebody.
6499480	6501480	They were part of some guild.
6501480	6502480	Make that last part!
6503480	6504480	Get back!
6504480	6505480	Come back!
6505480	6506480	Okay!
6506480	6507480	I'm there.
6507480	6508480	I ran so fast.
6508480	6509480	Hey!
6509480	6510480	What did you just say?
6510480	6511480	I'm sorry.
6511480	6513480	There was a tree in the way the audio was blocked.
6513480	6516480	The Banditos are disguised as Banditos.
6516480	6517480	They were sent by...
6517480	6519480	These are Boditos?
6521480	6522480	What the...
6522480	6524480	Oh my...
6525480	6528480	Friends and neighbors, I am pissed on...
6529480	6530480	Foe...
6531480	6532480	...Aoditos.
6532480	6536480	And they're part of some guild or something that I'm sure...
6536480	6538480	If we get back to town...
6538480	6539480	We'll find out.
6539480	6540480	They'll have headquarters there.
6540480	6541480	I mean, these guys aren't just...
6541480	6542480	Which town are we going to?
6542480	6543480	Yeah.
6543480	6544480	Where?
6544480	6545480	We're going back to the...
6545480	6546480	Tomfel town?
6546480	6547480	No, no, no, no.
6547480	6548480	We're going back to headquarters.
6548480	6550480	Go back to the Silver Flame, which is in...
6551480	6552480	Yup.
6553480	6554480	Yeah, what was the name of that town?
6554480	6555480	Yeah, what was that town?
6555480	6557480	Yeah, it hadn't been mentioned yet.
6557480	6558480	Oh, okay.
6559480	6560480	Why don't we go to the town?
6560480	6561480	But you all know the name of it.
6561480	6562480	We should know, yeah.
6562480	6563480	What is it?
6563480	6564480	You do know it.
6564480	6565480	What is it?
6565480	6566480	I'm not sure.
6567480	6569480	Well, I sure the fuck don't know.
6570480	6571480	It's Placeholder.
6572480	6573480	Oh.
6573480	6576480	Yeah, back in Placeholder, population...
6577480	6578480	Tilda...
6578480	6579480	One thousand.
6580480	6582480	Question mark, question mark, seven thousand.
6583480	6585480	There's probably better ways to...
6586480	6589480	Catch these banditos who aren't really banditos...
6590480	6592480	Then chasing them through the woods.
6592480	6595480	And so, Steve, you're still by the corpse, right?
6595480	6596480	I am.
6596480	6597480	Hey!
6597480	6598480	Hey, Steve!
6598480	6599480	Yeah?
6599480	6600480	Where are you, man?
6601480	6603480	I'm still looking at this corpse.
6604480	6605480	All right!
6605480	6606480	All right!
6609480	6610480	Come back to...
6611480	6613480	Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
6614480	6616480	He took some of the poison.
6617480	6618480	You mean like he drank it?
6618480	6619480	He took a poison?
6619480	6620480	No, no, no.
6620480	6621480	He's got it on him.
6621480	6622480	Just, I'm not...
6622480	6623480	I don't know why he took it.
6623480	6624480	I'm sauntering back.
6624480	6625480	All right.
6625480	6626480	Ooh.
6626480	6627480	Hi.
6630480	6632480	What's up with your wiggle?
6633480	6636480	I'm feeling really good about that guy getting cut in half.
6637480	6638480	Yeah, well...
6638480	6641480	He stabbed Patchens like seven times.
6641480	6642480	No, these are bad dudes.
6642480	6644480	They didn't expect us to live to see...
6644480	6647480	To tell the tale, much less catch back up with them,
6647480	6649480	which we will once we get to placeholder.
6649480	6651480	Do you think they went to placeholder?
6652480	6654480	It's been a long time since we've been to placeholder.
6655480	6658480	Yeah, before the campaign started.
6658480	6659480	That's where we were.
6663480	6666480	We got to get back and report to our superiors.
6666480	6669480	We got a sick Patchens.
6669480	6670480	Got to get him healed up.
6670480	6674480	But we're responsible for the fact that he lost his little artifact.
6674480	6676480	And believe me, we're going to make right by this kid.
6676480	6677480	Oh, good.
6679480	6681480	Should we go now?
6681480	6682480	Yeah.
6682480	6685480	We load up the cart.
6685480	6687480	You don't have a cart.
6688480	6689480	We load up the...
6689480	6690480	Do we have horses?
6690480	6691480	No.
6691480	6692480	Whatever happened to our horses?
6692480	6694480	You didn't take them when you left.
6694480	6695480	I thought we had a cart.
6695480	6696480	I thought we had a cart.
6696480	6697480	Yeah.
6698480	6699480	We should run back.
6699480	6702480	There was a cart, yeah, but there's no horses for it.
6707480	6709480	So we've just been walking?
6709480	6712480	Yeah, I don't think you've been taking the cart.
6713480	6716480	All right, well, we keep walking then.
6716480	6717480	Wait.
6717480	6718480	Right.
6718480	6719480	What are we, fucking animals?
6719480	6720480	Yeah.
6720480	6725480	Do we play rocks, paper, scissors for who gets to carry the rest of the team in the cart?
6725480	6727480	You know, like, be the horse?
6727480	6728480	I don't think you have the cart.
6728480	6732480	I don't think you would have just dragged the cart all this way without horses.
6732480	6733480	I thought we had two horses.
6733480	6734480	No, I don't think so.
6734480	6736480	That might be the case.
6736480	6740480	But the horses would have been killed while you guys were investigating stuff.
6740480	6743480	So when you came back to the cart, they wouldn't have been alive.
6743480	6744480	Oh, yeah.
6744480	6746480	Well, is Patchens okay to walk?
6746480	6749480	Yeah, but he's wounded and crying and sad.
6751480	6753480	You want me to talk to him?
6753480	6754480	I think you should.
6754480	6755480	Yes, yes, I can.
6755480	6756480	Okay.
6756480	6758480	Hey, buddy.
6758480	6759480	Hey, man.
6759480	6760480	He's crying.
6760480	6763480	What's going on?
6763480	6764480	What's happening?
6764480	6766480	What's happening up there?
6766480	6769480	What's going on in that head of yours, Patchens?
6769480	6770480	What's with that?
6770480	6771480	Come on.
6771480	6772480	Come on.
6772480	6773480	Nobody wants to hear this.
6773480	6775480	Nobody wants to hear this stuff.
6775480	6776480	I know.
6776480	6778480	Yeah, you think you got it pretty bad, huh?
6778480	6779480	You got it pretty bad?
6780480	6783480	Hey, look at this weird hand I have.
6785480	6787480	I was born with this.
6788480	6790480	You don't see me crying.
6791480	6793480	I got to figure it out, guys.
6793480	6794480	Took care of it.
6798480	6800480	I memorize spells.
6800480	6803480	Like, what if I meditate for four hours?
6803480	6804480	Yeah, sure.
6804480	6805480	I'm going to do a new loadout.
6805480	6806480	All right.
6806480	6810480	Did we just sit and watch him meditate for four hours?
6810480	6811480	And wait?
6811480	6813480	We should set up a little camp and build a fire.
6813480	6816480	I thought we were going to fucking the placeholder.
6816480	6820480	And then you started doing ordinary people with a non-player character.
6820480	6825480	I thought we were walking while ordinary people.
6825480	6826480	Yeah.
6826480	6828480	Have you ever seen ordinary people?
6828480	6829480	Yes, I have.
6829480	6830480	Yeah, you have.
6830480	6832480	Oh, what's your favorite scene in ordinary people?
6833480	6834480	Yeah.
6834480	6847480	When Faye Dunaway talks to Timothy Hutton about his brother's death by boat,
6847480	6852480	in which she feels she was cheated because she liked his brother better.
6852480	6856480	That's why he tried to kill himself and needs to see Judd Hirsch as a therapist.
6856480	6863480	It's basically Good Will Hunting with better actors and better writers.
6868480	6870480	Mary Tyler Moore and not Faye Dunaway.
6870480	6871480	Right.
6871480	6872480	Fuck you.
6872480	6873480	Nobody knew.
6873480	6874480	You didn't know.
6874480	6875480	I didn't know either.
6875480	6876480	Yeah, you didn't know.
6876480	6877480	No, no.
6877480	6878480	No, I didn't.
6878480	6879480	I didn't know.
6879480	6880480	I didn't know.
6880480	6882480	But I don't think that's what I was doing when I was talking about my weird hand.
6887480	6890480	So we all watch him for four hours meditating.
6890480	6894480	No, build a fire and sleep or something.
6894480	6895480	Setting up camp.
6895480	6898480	I can't sleep with you meditating next to me.
6905480	6907480	Shut the fuck up.
6911480	6912480	This guy.
6917480	6920480	Cleanse the world.
6920480	6922480	Learning loadout.
6925480	6926480	Four.
6927480	6928480	Okay.
6928480	6930480	I'm going to go with loadout.
6930480	6931480	Four.
6933480	6935480	Create water.
6936480	6937480	Detect magic.
6937480	6938480	Mending.
6938480	6939480	Purify food.
6939480	6940480	How?
6940480	6941480	This loadout sucks.
6941480	6942480	No, changing my mind.
6942480	6945480	What am I, a fucking Walmart?
6947480	6948480	I'm a loadout.
6948480	6949480	Three.
6949480	6950480	Offense.
6950480	6951480	Yeah.
6951480	6952480	Guidance.
6952480	6953480	Light.
6953480	6954480	Well, Carlos is doing this.
6954480	6959480	So I'm just doing like crunches and push-ups preparing for whatever's coming up next.
6959480	6962480	Yeah, I'm going to stick with the offensive loadout.
6962480	6963480	Cool.
6963480	6967480	Wait, after all that, you're deciding to stay with what you already had?
6967480	6968480	Well, I'm recharged now.
6968480	6971480	I have everything known again.
6971480	6972480	Okay.
6973480	6977480	Can I take out my compass and look for north?
6977480	6979480	You find it.
6979480	6981480	North is where we should go.
6981480	6984480	Let's go now.
6984480	6985480	All right.
6985480	6987480	We start heading north.
6987480	6990480	Let's find out what happens next time.
6990480	6991480	What?
6993480	6994480	Yeah, yeah, look at me.
6994480	6995480	This is me.
6995480	6996480	This is my fault.
6997480	7002480	Well, you could have had like an umber hulk come out of the fucking forest.
7002480	7004480	An umber hulk comes out of the forest.
7004480	7005480	Oh, shit.
7005480	7007480	Fucking his own, man.
7007480	7008480	Come on.
7008480	7009480	God damn it.
7009480	7015480	I start running around the umber hulk at 20, running as fast as I can.
7015480	7016480	All right.
7016480	7018480	I'm running around the umber hulk.
7018480	7021480	You provoke 30 attacks of opportunity.
7023480	7024480	I think, yeah, that's good.
7024480	7025480	Yes, he's proud of himself.
7025480	7026480	All right.
7026480	7029480	Well, that's Harmatown for this week.
7033480	7040480	Zach McKeever, Chris Beruff, Sarah Hill.
7042480	7043480	Man.
7043480	7045480	It's never this quiet when Jeff ends the show.
7045480	7047480	Well, he always hits the music.
7047480	7050480	Guest Comptroller, Rob Schramm, Game Master, Spencer Crittenden,
7050480	7057480	Steve Levy, Eddie Pepitone, the city of Burbank, the state of California.
7059480	7062480	Maybe I was kidding when I called you stupid.
7063480	7065480	Maybe I don't care.
7065480	7066480	We don't know.
7066480	7067480	Stay in the fog.
7067480	7068480	Stay curious.
7068480	7071480	Look at everybody running out of the building.
7071480	7076480	You're welcome for the free booze, but tip the Venmo, tip the bartender.
