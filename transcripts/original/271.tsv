36440	37960	stand up and cheer yourself up.
37960	43800	Stand up and clap, please keep clapping for the mayor of Hormontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.
43800	60240	Ho, ho, yo, ho, ho, ho, yo, ho, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, I'm Santa Claus, I'm up on your
60240	65400	roof, I fucked your mama in the gap between her tooths, I put my dick in her mouth like
65400	71440	a thermometer, I took her temperature, I'm glad I got out of there, I came back next
71440	76280	year, always give her a present, she sheds a tear, she says, I left your milk, I left
76280	84040	your cookies, why don't you give me something better.
84040	94880	And I say, cuz, you're naughty, but you're nice, you got head lice.
94880	100440	Back next year.
100440	109720	Don't ever fear, fascist takeover, down your chimney, a sack of guns, that's all you're
109720	114280	getting so you better run, if you live in Alabama, they came for you first, but you
114280	121200	held the line, you quenched a democratic thirst, yo, thank you, black women, forget black men,
121200	126200	you're 94%, it's not good enough, alright, spoilers.
126200	131560	You finish strong, you finish strong.
131560	136520	I had a second wind there where it felt like a political Santa started rapping a little
136520	140480	bit better than whoever that guy that was opening was.
140480	146880	This is our Christmas special, it's gonna be a really, really big special show.
146880	153120	I threw out the notion leaving the stage yesterday, like maybe it would be nice if we really Christmased
153120	158160	up the stage, and look what, Chris Baruff, who gets credit, everybody?
158160	166000	Sarah Hill, like quarterback to this, I believe, Chris was probably like a offensive lineman,
166000	171000	someone's mooing, or is that- Also bake those delicious chocolate chip cookies,
171000	177000	two types, vegan and gutsy, I mean, come on.
177000	182880	With snacks like this set out, I wouldn't be surprised if we had a few special guests
182880	184840	drop by for a nibble.
184840	185840	What?
185840	186840	What?
186840	188480	So it is an extra special show.
188480	189480	Excellent.
189480	196840	Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't get our hopes, it's not like Gal Gadot's coming, but it's special
196840	199560	because we're in a good mood.
199560	201440	We're probably not doing a show next week, right?
201440	202440	No.
202440	205880	Right, because it'll be like Christmas Eve, is that math right?
205880	212180	So you should spend time with your family and or activist group or whatever.
212180	214180	Your new family.
214180	215180	Your people.
215180	216180	The people you pick.
216180	221200	Even if you have to find them at random in some chat room, find a family.
221200	226600	I don't want to orphan shame you, if family doesn't mean parents.
226600	227600	What's the orphan gonna do?
227600	228600	Nothing?
228600	229600	Orphan don't even have no back.
229600	232080	Orphan don't even have no internet.
232080	234040	Orphan don't even have no internet, thank you.
234040	235040	Yeah.
235200	237400	We should all be orphaned soon.
237400	242020	Net neutrality's been repealed, which means that I'll have some special rich person's
242020	248840	internet where I only get Netflix and poor people tracker to watch and monitor the outside
248840	249840	of my house.
249840	257560	Poor people will also have a poor version of Netflix where they can stream movies that
257560	261680	don't have too triumphant a message in them.
261680	266160	Those will be put in a special fast lane for rich people and then poor people will
266160	273920	also have FaceTime if they're at work and they want to check on their kids in the re-education
273920	274920	camps.
274920	279280	Poor people will get all the movies that rich people get, just no endings.
279280	285160	I really feel that this net neutrality thing, even though we don't know what it is, a lot
285160	290480	of us, I understand it's like when I was a kid when people would talk about Nicaragua,
290480	295000	all you knew was that something bad was happening, didn't want to do the research, it was hard.
295000	298720	Net neutrality is like, it may as well be the name of some crazy nation where we don't
298720	303320	know what's going on, but I think you've probably figured it out by now.
303320	305640	God knows all the people that supported it.
305640	313520	I could see on Twitter had this massive rush of a week where they, having just now started
313520	318520	asking each other what it was because all they knew is that in their opinion, the bad
318520	321240	guys liked it and now it was time to repeal it.
321240	326000	Someone got to these people and said it was like, Obama-trality or something.
326000	330960	You could see them all looking it up and going, huh?
330960	335680	Their big insults were like, I'd just like to see some of these people explain this shit
335680	336680	that are complaining.
336680	337680	It's like, nice try.
337680	341240	No one's doing your homework for you, you fucking greasy fuck face.
341240	343080	It's also super easy to explain.
343080	345960	The people who brought us ATMs now want to charge us for ATMs.
345960	348400	It's the same old argument.
348920	355160	The agency that we created, because we once thought the radio waves might run out, stuck
355160	358280	around because once you create a government agency, you just don't get rid of it.
358280	361120	You never have a meeting and go, we don't need no ATF anymore.
361120	362120	What are we doing?
362120	363520	We love alcohol, tobacco, and firearms.
363520	365800	Let's just get rid of them.
365800	367760	These agencies just hang around.
367760	370600	If you're the FCC, you just hang around.
370600	377160	We started using them to at least enforce the concept of neutrality, which much as Thomas
377160	380320	Jefferson said about freedom of speech, when I think he was one of the people that was
380320	384280	like, maybe we shouldn't put this in this document because then it becomes a legal matter
384280	389160	and free speech is going to only get less free if lawyers start arguing about it.
389160	392320	But anyways, we put the FCC in charge.
392320	393320	Here's your job.
393320	395560	Stand there and say there's net neutrality.
395560	397320	That's your new job.
397320	400240	You don't have to care if there's tits or F words anymore.
400240	404720	You can just stand there and say there needs to be net neutrality.
404840	414440	So now we had them stop standing there and now they're happy because now it's just the
414440	416800	internet is now private property.
416800	418640	All of us are trespassing on it.
418640	423320	We're all going to be traveling at speeds that are able to be throttled by the monopolies
423320	425720	that control your access to the internet.
425720	431560	Probably my audience is not only aware of this, but actually very annoyed with my ignorance
431560	432560	of it.
432560	439120	You talked about it in the past and you also reeled against the marketing flaw of the name
439120	444040	net neutrality and you brought up the ultimate suggestion that should have been and maybe
444040	449160	would have swung everything, suggestion that they should change the name to I think butt
449160	450160	fun.
450160	454840	It's a more positive name than net neutrality.
454840	457280	Butt fun might have worked, but here's the thing.
457280	458360	It's just such an assault.
458480	464760	At this point, it's not as if there wasn't a chance for the democratic will of the people
464760	465760	to be known.
465760	469860	It was absolutely known, registered, measured.
469860	470960	It was there.
470960	474600	We know that the country did not want this.
474600	482080	Only some rubes who thought for a busy work week because they only read Nazi zines thought
482080	485840	that maybe they didn't want it.
485840	492160	A vast, vast majority of everybody, even the people who only could bother to care a little
492160	497800	better, like, yeah, that sounds like a dumb thing to lose and they didn't give a fuck.
497800	502840	It's like we are definitely at this point and I think there's one step left, which is
502840	505040	this horrible Christmas rumor, which is that ...
505040	506040	What?
506040	509760	Well, there's this rumor that I retweeted.
509760	517200	Everyone's gearing up because for the Saturday Night Massacre part two, which is the rumor
517200	521200	that Trump is going to fire Mueller over Christmas.
521200	522200	Yeah, no.
522200	523200	But yeah, I hear you.
523200	524200	I've heard that rumor.
524200	525200	All right.
525200	526200	Let's talk about black people in Alabama.
526200	527200	No, no, no.
527200	528200	What do you think?
528200	529200	What are the odds on this?
529200	530200	What is your plan?
530200	531200	Because you have a handgun.
531200	532200	I don't have a fucking plan.
532200	533200	But you have a gun.
533200	536920	I have one plan, which is the move on dot whatever plan that I retweeted, which is like
536920	542320	you RSVP to a thing that says they can text you and so that within 24 hours of Mueller
542320	547160	getting fired, we're all going to just flood the streets that are ... You're shaking your
547160	548160	head.
548160	551760	That's a bad plan.
551760	557520	I suggest we all light a cigarette and take it up the butt one more time.
557520	561160	Not that taking it up the butt is a bad thing, only if it's against your choice.
561160	563560	If he fires Mueller, you think we should ...
563560	564960	You're getting used to it.
564960	565960	What?
566000	567920	You're so cynical.
567920	569320	I'm not ... I'm just going to be honest.
569320	571600	I'm going to say we blew it a long time ago.
571600	578120	This is like if our father who left our mother comes back drunk on Easter, are we going to
578120	579120	celebrate?
579120	580120	No.
580120	581120	We know where we are.
581120	582120	That motherfucker don't love us.
582120	583280	That's how it is.
583280	584280	We are in such trouble.
584280	587280	But this is about rule of law.
587280	588280	It's about-
588280	589280	What you going to do?
589280	595320	It's about slap his hand when he reaches out for the applesauce and he cannot be passed.
595800	600800	It's the last rule that he will have to break if he wants to know he has permission to break
600800	602760	all rules forever.
602760	610200	I know we've all had a lot of final lines drawn in our personal sands and things, but
610200	615880	this is the second fucking guy that's an independent person that's trying to hold ... to just bring
615880	619560	this investigation into the goddamn station.
619560	626040	Any president should be absolutely willing to watch it play out.
626040	636200	It's obscenely almost funny how little fault can be found with this particular guy.
636200	645240	If this autocrat fires him over Christmas break, that is him saying, that's like a kid
645240	651320	taking his dick out and putting it in his mother's face over Christmas while company's
651320	652320	over.
652320	654120	What's the mom supposed to do?
654120	657520	Your advice is to say, why don't you just suck on it a little bit?
657520	658520	Maybe he'll fall asleep.
658520	659520	No.
659520	662760	I'm saying your kid was ... First of all, that's not what my mother did.
662760	665040	She sent me to my room.
665040	668680	Second of all, I'm saying your kid was bad before you brought him to the Christmas table
668680	671440	and now you're going to reprimand him in front of us and scar our fucking Christmas?
671440	673200	Why are you so fatalistic now?
673200	674800	You're always the uplifting guy.
674840	677280	I'm still uplifted, but I'm like this.
677280	684520	Somebody been squeezing your titties this long and you're really going to say so.
684520	685760	This is a privileged thing, right?
685760	689520	This is like a welcome to the party white boy thing.
689520	693840	I'm just very honestly telling you that we're not on the gun side.
693840	697760	What you would want is for the militia people to do something, but they're on his side.
697760	703520	As liberals, if they do something else to us, let's be honest, we don't have the votes
703520	705160	to impeach.
705160	706640	We're just not getting Congress back.
706640	708040	We can't really fuck with this dude.
708040	713520	Yeah, but don't you want to ... Not on that level.
713520	716320	The Women's March did accomplish something.
716320	717760	It didn't accomplish anything in writing.
717760	722360	It didn't accomplish any legislation.
722360	728880	The sheer numbers, the fact that people's arms were rubbing up against glass and plaster
728880	733120	and no one was fighting and the streets were clogged in every major city because he fucked
733120	738960	with women and women's rights and then it was just like, flop and then since then it's
738960	741920	been like, let's try that again and everyone's like, you know what?
741920	742920	I got work.
742920	750000	I got to pick up my kids, but this is the other thing.
750000	754360	This is the thing where you want your numbers to count, where you want somebody to know.
754360	759160	I would almost say I like the RSVP system because I like the idea that the news item
759160	765880	that ends up back on Fox News where he can see it says, you know, by the way, 90 million
765880	768760	Americans say that this is fucking it.
768760	772200	They can't handle it anymore and they're going to actually walk out of their house, not show
772200	775320	up at their job and they're going to go down to City Hall and stand there and piss at a
775320	778160	bucket until something changes.
778160	780280	But I don't think that this is it.
780280	781280	All right.
781280	784400	Because we just don't have the numbers.
784560	792200	But this is the guy in charge of the investigation that absolutely is, I mean, in some weird
792200	799680	universe, which if we're people that observe law and order, we have to acknowledge.
799680	802960	There's some weird universe where they go, you know what?
802960	803960	This is all clean.
803960	804960	It's all fine.
804960	805960	He's perfect.
805960	807240	We looked through his tax returns.
807240	812800	We looked through his connections, his financial information, the four years leading up to
812800	814120	this whole thing.
814120	815120	You know what?
815120	816120	There's no hanky-panky going on.
816120	817520	This is just fine.
817520	823000	And then we all said either that's going to happen or there's going to be a fucking thing.
823000	829440	And so if this investigation doesn't reach its conclusion, what are we doing then?
829440	831720	What are you so excited to get on with?
831720	834640	Then we're just defeated and hanging out and just like.
834640	837400	Yeah, I think they stole it from us.
837400	838400	They got it right now.
838400	840120	Well, we have our streets.
840120	841320	We have each other.
841320	842780	We have ACLU.
842780	843880	We have Planned Parenthood.
843880	846160	We have these grassroots things.
846160	847720	The political thing, I don't think we have.
847720	851640	I honestly don't know how we're going to come back from him firing Mueller because I don't
851640	853760	know what we can do.
853760	855400	That's not what we do.
855400	859000	It's just got to be like a, we just got to be, there has to be enough of us and we got
859000	860000	to go like this.
860000	861000	Right.
861000	866200	That's the problem with I like, I love being a liberal, but it's like when war starts,
866200	870940	we kind of are not the first people to take up arms and it's kind of hard to get motivated
870940	873520	to fight them on that level.
873520	876440	I can fight them on the, we need to have some food drives.
876440	880840	I can fight them on the race funds for a family that gets burned out in the California fires.
880840	886360	But when they start doing crazy upper level government stuff, that's not, that's not where
886360	889280	we, me personally, I can't really fuck with them on that level.
889280	895720	I'm like, you guys just got away with a heist and I honestly can't even correct that heist.
895720	896720	You know what I'm saying?
896720	897720	Yeah.
897720	898720	Yeah.
898720	900640	It'd be like, honestly, if they were like, we're raising interest rates.
900640	903400	Well I'm going, I RSVP, they got my number.
903400	906280	So here's the thing that I want to say about these marches because you asked, what did
906280	908080	the women's march do?
908080	912400	And I think that these shows a force, whatever we show up in large numbers, it lets people
912400	915520	know next time there'll be more of us and there'll be more of us and there'll be more
915520	916520	of us.
916520	918400	And we also get to look at each other and say, I'm with you.
918400	919400	I got your back.
919400	920400	I'm with you.
920400	921400	So it works.
921400	922400	All right.
922400	926320	But when those marches wind up in the places where people are disenfranchised, then I'll
926320	928960	know that we're not playing around.
928960	934120	Like when you do a women's march that actually winds up going to the women's center in downtown
934120	938840	L.A. and maybe helping out, those bodies, those thousands of people show up week after
938840	943840	week to keep those infrastructure up, then I'll be like, okay, we are doing some shit.
943840	947100	We're in trouble and we're reacting in a positive way.
947100	951240	When they take the march all the way to Compton, instead of stopping it in the richest part
951240	955740	of the city, which is downtown L.A., when they march all the way to Compton and they
955740	960020	spend money in those stores, they look around and they clean up those buildings.
960020	961780	They pick up some trash.
961780	963180	Then I'll be like, okay, now we're in there.
963180	964180	What do they got?
964180	965180	What do they got in the store?
965180	966180	They got good shit in those stores.
966180	967180	They got a little candy store?
967180	968180	Yeah.
968180	969180	A candy house?
969180	970180	Is there vape?
970180	971180	Is there vape place?
971180	972820	There's all sorts of secondhand shit.
972820	973820	There's shops down there.
973820	976780	But there's the point is, like, we're still talking shit.
976780	982060	So on this one, we can't really draw a line in the sand because we don't that's not how
982060	983060	we even operate.
983060	984060	All right.
984060	985060	Find Brandon Johnson.
985380	988580	That doesn't that doesn't mean we shouldn't be outraged.
988580	990620	It's just really what are you what are we supposed to do?
990620	993100	All fly to Washington, D.C., when this happens?
993100	994100	We should all.
994100	995100	Yeah, let's do that.
995100	996100	Yeah.
996100	997100	How do we all have that money?
997100	998340	We don't all have that money.
998340	1000780	No, but everyone who does can.
1000780	1005500	And hopefully that's, you know, enough people to break the walls down.
1005500	1006740	What are we going to do when we get there?
1006740	1008660	We're going to we're going to raise money for poor people?
1008660	1013220	No, we're going to throw ourselves violently at the walls of the White House until our
1013220	1016540	bodies have to be removed from the Capitol.
1016540	1023620	Can we instead of maybe going to them, take ourselves away from the Internet?
1023620	1028220	We can we maybe tell these motherfuckers what we expect it to be so they give us shit like
1028220	1031020	hybrid cars, like solar panels.
1031020	1036620	Can we teach industry how to listen to us when we say we don't want to throttle?
1036620	1039300	Why are we even using our government to talk to these motherfuckers when quite honestly
1039300	1042420	as a consumer, can't we just tell them we don't want that shit?
1043060	1043860	Well, they're monopolies.
1043860	1045860	They have a very worded monopolies.
1045860	1050540	But why don't we take a couple of months off and hit their bottom line?
1050540	1053860	All right. Well, because that's that's way faster than Congress.
1053860	1055700	And that's what they respond to.
1055700	1058620	They stop making clear Pepsi.
1058620	1061700	I think they I think I think they waited.
1061700	1067980	They clear Pepsi didn't successfully wait 30 years so that everyone that needed to send
1067980	1074420	out their resume, get get get memos from their boss, coordinate with their babysitter,
1074420	1078540	get in touch with their family, let everyone know what they're doing, had to use clear Pepsi.
1078540	1080380	You know, like they waited till the right time.
1080380	1082860	Like they're I don't know if I would go.
1082860	1085460	We shut Blockbuster down.
1085460	1088580	What? That's because DVDs came out.
1088580	1089660	What do you mean?
1089660	1093660	DVDs came out because Blockbuster was renting to us and we were all surrounded.
1093660	1096340	We were going to Blockbuster like it was a thing, the whole family.
1096340	1099620	Right. And then Blockbuster was like, we could just hit you for fees.
1099620	1102140	We don't even care if you keep the movie, rent the movie, whatever.
1102140	1103500	We're going to hit you for fees.
1103500	1107940	And then states came out and said, no, fees are the are the duty of the state.
1107940	1110260	That's the only thing. That's the only recourse we have.
1110260	1113220	A private entity can't collect fees or then we're all fucked.
1113220	1115860	Well, that was before my time. I don't know.
1115860	1118900	I think it was right when you were like eight.
1118900	1123140	So that that sort of facilitated industry to respond in a way where you got Netflix,
1123140	1126660	where that motherfucker came along and was like, hey, you ain't got to pay fees.
1126660	1128740	You can keep the DVD. We don't even care.
1128740	1129980	We want a subscription service.
1129980	1134660	So I'm like, we have taught corporations and industries how we want to be treated.
1134660	1139060	And if they need to learn it again on this net neutrality thing,
1139060	1141780	that's just the deal. That's the deal.
1141780	1145580	When they put shitty TV on, we stop watching and we went over to the Internet.
1145580	1148140	And if they fuck the Internet up, well, I don't know.
1148140	1150780	Maybe we'll go back to hanging out with each other and reading books and shit.
1150780	1156220	But overall, they will learn from us how we're about to get treated.
1156220	1157420	All right. So false alarm.
1157420	1160740	I came up and said, you know, so everything's going to be fine,
1160740	1164060	because when when we finally get mistreated enough,
1164060	1166260	we're going to show them what's up by going to the Women's Center.
1166260	1170100	Yeah, I don't think anything bad will happens when it comes out officially
1170100	1173260	that it turns out you can rig an election without consequence.
1173260	1176940	I think going forward, it'll all be fine. Yeah.
1176940	1179620	I just want to know if anybody wants to deal on some of this delicious lead paint.
1179620	1184140	I got the it goes great with the space.
1184140	1187620	I mean, they fucking took huge sodas out of New York.
1187620	1193340	That's a possibility we can do a lot of damage that wants to be good for ourselves.
1193340	1196180	You know, well, yeah, I mean, we're in California.
1196180	1199260	We're going to be fine no matter what. That's the thing.
1199260	1202700	It's not about like our specific comfort, I don't think, hopefully.
1202700	1207980	I mean, even without net neutrality, like I can afford to pay for a fast lane,
1207980	1213300	you know, but it's not that's not what's at stake for the bigger picture, right?
1213300	1216460	No, but California is already art.
1216460	1218940	We've already started to sue like immediately.
1218940	1221420	And I think there's 10 other states is 11 total.
1221420	1224940	Eleven states have already pushed back and said you're not going to be able to do this.
1224940	1230300	So while it is terrifying and it's not fair, we do we we stand a good chance
1230300	1235220	of getting our way in this deal if we fight as citizens,
1235220	1239140	if we keep trying to legislate our way out of these battles, it's going to get rough.
1239140	1242740	And well, you know, showing up to a thing where you sit cross legged in the street
1242740	1247420	until they mace you and drag you away and use your body to gum up the works of
1247420	1251740	that that's not legislation. That's I'm talking about these moments where
1251740	1254500	and I understand what you're saying that.
1254500	1259020	I mean, you're basically saying like, yeah, all the people that have lines
1259020	1263620	in the sand that have to do with when an ideology has been
1263620	1267940	transgressed, they don't give a fuck about the people that live 20 yards from them
1267940	1270860	and they don't give a fuck about what's going on in their real life.
1270860	1275180	And they could they could be like Jim Carrey and yes, man, and start changing their lives
1275180	1279740	completely and disrupting everything in their comfort zone.
1279740	1283260	And I all of that is true.
1283260	1288860	But it's also really easy to get like 50 million people to just like open their windows
1288860	1291460	and say, I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.
1291460	1295620	And sometimes that needs to happen as well. Certainly.
1295620	1299820	But let's fight an economic battle with economics.
1299820	1306260	I think that definitely we need to avail ourselves more of like boycotting based tactics than we have been.
1306260	1307940	That's right. That's very powerful.
1307940	1312180	And people can shame you for it. That's where the that's where the battleground has morphed.
1312180	1315780	We now have no fucking legal recourse.
1315780	1318140	Net neutrality is now going to be a financial game.
1318140	1320100	It's going to be about boycotts and all this shit.
1320100	1331940	But Trump firing Mueller is like it's it's it's fucking it's a real it's a home invasion of everyone's home from by one guy who's saying,
1331940	1333660	I don't want checks and balances.
1333660	1335260	I don't want three branches.
1335260	1339620	I don't want any any of the Constitution to apply to me.
1339620	1343220	I want to be an autocrat.
1343220	1344820	Say nothing if that's fine.
1344820	1352340	And by the way, just drink your eggnog because I'm going to do it on the fucking 22nd of December while everyone's gone.
1352340	1356860	Like if he does that and everyone just hangs out,
1356860	1360580	I'm not going to take that as a sign that we're going to help the local YMCA or anything.
1360580	1363220	Like I don't think I'm going to take that as a sign that we've given up.
1363220	1368580	And so is him and whatever the fuck he's representing,
1368580	1374020	whatever evil cloud is in his is guiding him with the power of Mordor.
1374020	1380180	Like like we we have to it's the one thing we've been waiting for is just like,
1380180	1382620	will you just would you would you just submit to due process?
1382620	1384180	Will you let us frisk you?
1384180	1389220	You won't let you won't fucking like submit like just say,
1389220	1390660	I'm a crooked person.
1390660	1391820	I'm a criminal.
1391820	1396180	I like I have my fingers in dirty pies and then say,
1396180	1398460	but I'm a businessman or whatever and defend it.
1398460	1401940	He's been lying and fucking putting it off for so long and trying.
1401940	1406340	And like I just I like all right.
1406340	1409500	All right. Well, whatever we said our piece we're talking to circles.
1409500	1411100	Yeah, I'm still on the uplift.
1411100	1414580	I just I recognize which battle and maybe how we should fight it.
1414580	1421580	I recognize which battle I and I alone and all of you.
1421580	1423940	Yeah, I RSVP to that stupid thing and I'm showing up.
1423940	1425100	They text me and they go.
1425100	1425980	He just fired Miller.
1425980	1429980	I'm going to go like I'm not going to I'm not going down there with a with a bat or anything.
1429980	1432420	I'm going to go I'm just going to go down there and eat some spaghetti
1432420	1438100	that I bring in a thermos and and then I don't know what I don't know what to do.
1438100	1441620	And then maybe I'll just like I'll just lay down and eat grass until I die.
1441620	1442340	I don't know.
1442340	1447980	Like I just I don't want to make plans for after that day.
1447980	1449220	He can't do this.
1449220	1452460	I know. I know. But we got this.
1452460	1453780	We still got this.
1453780	1455260	We got this. We got this.
1455260	1457620	We got this. We got this.
1457660	1463420	Let's lighten things up a little with a visit from Socialist Santa Claus.
1463420	1464860	Socialist Santa's here.
1472580	1474420	Santa. Hello.
1474980	1479060	I gave my hat to someone with a colder head. Oh, Santa.
1479060	1484500	So when I needed it more simple, can can I talk about Robert Mueller for a second?
1484500	1486100	Yeah, of course.
1486100	1487740	Are you going to take my side a little bit?
1487740	1488980	I feel a little bit better.
1488980	1490820	Look at that.
1490820	1493660	It doesn't sound like it.
1493660	1496340	So I think there's another side, right?
1496340	1498460	I think a third side.
1498460	1501420	There's a third. I think there's only two sides.
1501980	1507140	I think there's a side that it doesn't matter that the investigation
1507140	1513220	trying to pin Trump on a technicality, right, is what the Democrats
1513220	1514900	want to do more than anything,
1514900	1518340	because then you look at it and you go, aha, I got him.
1518540	1521260	And now he has to resign because I got him.
1521420	1524940	And what Trump does is he goes, no, you didn't get me.
1525500	1527820	And and legally speaking, right?
1527820	1530580	Like, no, you didn't get me does not hold up in court.
1531340	1536180	But when the only recourse is like being impeached by the Republicans
1536180	1541460	that control Congress, no, you didn't get me kind of wins.
1542020	1544660	Right. So we're never going to get them on a technicality.
1544660	1548780	If he refuses to acknowledge the technicality.
1549020	1553100	Is it a technicality to say, hey, Russia, do you want to have a conference
1553100	1554660	about rigging this election?
1554660	1558580	And then Russia says, here's some data you can use to rig this election.
1558740	1561380	Yeah, because like we do it all the time.
1561380	1563380	But that's OK.
1563380	1566860	So then those countries that we do that with with have every right
1566860	1568740	to engage us in the court of law.
1568740	1571020	What that is is against the law.
1571540	1573860	And in theory, that's not a technicality.
1573860	1575900	That's just the law being executed.
1575900	1579140	It's what presidential candidate before this moment in history
1579140	1583460	has ever been caught red handed, actually conspiring with the intelligence
1583460	1589420	of during an election, the intelligence from a foreign hostile
1589420	1593620	foreign power in order to beat their domestic enemy in an election.
1593620	1597420	I mean, there's the story of Kissinger and Nixon during the Vietnam War.
1597420	1600980	The two of them on Kissinger, I believe, was working
1601780	1607460	for Johnson at the time and Nixon was a candidate
1607620	1610300	and it looked like there was going to be peace in Vietnam.
1610300	1614140	They were going to sign a peace accord where it would be like, hey, Vietnam,
1614140	1616300	that war is going to be done.
1616300	1621220	And then Nixon and Kissinger kind of pulled a little fast one
1621220	1625180	and caused a whoopsie in Vietnam that made the war keep going
1625260	1630620	because Nixon knew that he'd win if his opponent didn't stop the war.
1630980	1633140	So the war was good for his campaign.
1633300	1636020	And it came out in papers later and, you know,
1636020	1637580	because Nixon fucking taped everything.
1637580	1640380	It came out in papers later because Nixon fucking taped everything.
1640380	1641420	Yeah, that's the thing.
1641420	1644100	But he didn't get away with it or rather he got away with it.
1644100	1646180	He didn't get caught on this thing, right?
1646180	1648820	Because Bush didn't get caught because he turned himself in.
1649700	1653100	So when they came to Bush with dirt, he went to the FBI.
1653100	1656940	I mean, we're breaking elections against our own people
1656940	1658980	with voter suppression and that kind of shit.
1658980	1659540	Yes, we are.
1659540	1663140	But yet you guys are going you guys are taking such a wide scope
1663140	1668740	in order to refute a really, really like specific thing here.
1668740	1674740	This guy is under investigation for an actual crime to if we sit up here
1674740	1678420	and read a book about from Noam Chomsky about how we're
1679020	1682060	America is the foremost enemy of democracy across the planet.
1682060	1683500	I have no argument with that.
1683500	1687820	But but that this is this is a this is a politician
1687980	1693980	who is basically openly making a play to change the margins
1693980	1697820	ever more of of politics and what's allowed, including the fact that
1697820	1702180	when you are running for president in our country, it's OK
1702300	1707260	to engage in treasonous behavior as because the end justifies the means.
1707260	1711020	And once you're in the Oval Office, then you can say, I don't give a shit.
1711020	1712300	And it'll it'll go round and round.
1712300	1716980	And you guys, your argument is basically it's America's poopy.
1717260	1722380	And and it's kind of happened before with our most horrible presidents
1722380	1724180	during our most horrible times in history.
1724180	1726780	Therefore, let's, you know, it's fine.
1726980	1729940	We can care about this and hand out blankets lately.
1730060	1732900	I know I'm not doing either, but yeah, it's not that.
1732900	1736540	It's that I feel like once we fucked up, we fucked up.
1737860	1738860	That's the situation.
1738860	1741820	But that's that's all election systems or not all.
1741820	1743620	That's all of our election systems.
1743620	1745740	If you've comes out, you rig an election.
1746100	1749900	The result isn't that the the runner up is then installed.
1749900	1753420	The result is that someone gets a punitive action and then those courts
1753420	1756380	or those districts or something changes structurally generally.
1756380	1757140	That's what you can hope for.
1757140	1761140	And if he has to say, no, I didn't do that, well, we hold up an x-ray of him
1761140	1765620	doing that and and it still doesn't get him thrown in jail or replaced
1765620	1768300	with a with an Amazon drone for president.
1768540	1772860	I it's still important, an important part of the process to go, Mikey,
1772860	1777580	did you is this a photo of you taking a shit in the living room
1777780	1780740	and let the little piece of shit say, no, it's not.
1780740	1782620	So everything goes on the bulletin boards.
1782620	1788420	I mean, I can't I can't imagine like justifying not being invested
1788420	1790180	in these in these moments.
1790180	1795060	I I understand the argument that if you guys were to say this is a circus
1795060	1798820	that's directing your attention and energy away from something else.
1798820	1799580	I think that's true.
1799580	1803820	But I think it's it's a distraction that's a real important distraction.
1803820	1805980	Well, let's let's talk about what the outcome would be.
1805980	1809100	Right. Like a potential investigation.
1809460	1812860	And now this is I have an opinion that I don't think is going to be very popular.
1812860	1816980	But I feel like if there's going to be a Republican president,
1817140	1822300	it better fucking be Donald Trump, because to me, I look at Donald Trump
1822300	1827660	and I see 90 to 95 percent of what any Republican would do.
1827940	1831020	Five to 10 percent of like rancid,
1831540	1835100	whipped cheese filling or whatever that he brings to the table.
1835940	1839740	But fundamentally, he's such a gross ogre
1840020	1843020	that all of the normal Republican things that he does.
1843220	1844900	People are like, oh, this sucks.
1844900	1846140	And he's bad. Yeah.
1846140	1849060	But the reason he's a gross ogre is because he's making an open play
1849060	1852180	for a shift toward something called autocracy
1852180	1856180	instead of where we've been mired in a sort of openly hypocritical
1856300	1858420	illusory form of checks and balances.
1858420	1861380	I mean, the guys that have occupied his position,
1861540	1864940	maybe they're autocrats in bureaucratic clothing,
1864940	1869780	but they're not actually just standing up in front of Boy Scout rallies
1869780	1874300	and saying, I wish there was less people in Congress so I could fuck more girls.
1874460	1877540	I like like he is a third world leader
1877660	1882020	who is who has risen through a fascist movement that has been, you know,
1882020	1886980	has been provoked and made possible through like insidious means.
1886980	1890660	And I'm not one of these people that goes, oh, because if a Russian tweets
1890660	1894020	a meme that says Pepe the Frog thinks Hillary is a kind that
1894260	1897100	and then you win the election that way, that that means they hacked the election.
1897300	1899220	That means we're stupid and we deserve what we get.
1899420	1904140	But this guy knew about it and played ball with it and thought it was funny
1904420	1907940	and thought that it was what he deserves because he's a sociopath
1907940	1912500	and a 90 IQ fucking horrible monster just like the presidents
1912500	1915860	that people get in the countries where we so successfully suppress democracy
1916020	1918660	that you end up with a fucking animal leading the people.
1918820	1922220	And it's hypocritical of me to the point where my voice is changing.
1923260	1927740	But but but I I don't want to live in a country
1927740	1931260	the the kind of which we create all around the planet.
1931540	1932780	Well, so here's the question. Right.
1932780	1935460	And I think it goes exactly to your point where you said
1936100	1939500	that there was sort of the autocrat in bureaucrats clothing
1939500	1941940	or the plain faced autocrat.
1941940	1945820	And my question to you is which one is better seeing your enemy
1945820	1949980	for who they really are or letting them hide and get away with style wise.
1950020	1952380	The ones better where you can see the wolf for the wolf.
1952380	1954860	But we're talking about a coup here.
1954860	1959540	We're talking about we're talking about people saying, would it be OK, America,
1959540	1963540	now that you're good and fat and scared and stupid and armed to the teeth
1963540	1967300	and xenophobic and unemployed and fucking confused
1967380	1970820	and have all have iPhones in your pockets, would it be OK?
1970820	1974820	Everyone now that most of you think that New Year's Eve is it means
1974820	1979060	that America's 2000 years old and all these things that demoralize us
1979060	1980940	when we find out how fucking stupid we all are.
1980940	1983940	Would it be OK with you guys as long as everyone's everything's good
1983940	1986700	and stupid and lazy and fearful and sad
1987020	1991260	if we just shift towards the open faced version
1991260	1993540	of the closed faced sandwich we were already eating?
1993740	1995140	Is that OK with everybody?
1995140	2000260	And you're saying, yes, it is because it because it's like
2000300	2003300	you knew the shit sandwich was already shit,
2003300	2008020	but that doesn't mean the guy saying, is it cool if I just start calling it
2008020	2009300	rape while I rape?
2009300	2014140	Like saying yes doesn't mean you're protecting people.
2014140	2016820	It doesn't mean that your your value system is better.
2016820	2020060	It just means that the cynicism is eaten away at you
2020220	2024300	unless there's like an alternative plan, which I know that you guys are.
2024300	2026340	I think you guys are street level.
2026340	2031340	Think, you know, act locally kind of minds that are like, you know,
2031580	2033620	you're more right than me. I know you are.
2033620	2038660	But but I because we should basically if I took the, you know,
2038660	2041740	the the the collective of what you two are saying, I would you know,
2041740	2045300	it's like let's stop even glancing at People magazine
2045300	2047260	when we check out at the grocery store.
2047260	2049540	Maybe let's try to grow our own food.
2049540	2051700	Let's definitely not get on the Internet.
2051700	2053220	Tell people that want to get in touch with you,
2053220	2056220	that they can put a duct tape on your driveway and you'll you'll come down there
2056220	2057820	and leave a potted plant on a tortoise.
2057820	2060820	And I did that one time and you will not let it.
2060820	2062700	It is so hard to book you.
2062700	2065140	They they they I that's how it's puted.
2065140	2069780	That sounds like I'm I drifted into that's not that's me riffing absurdly.
2069780	2074500	That's not me characterizing you guys as being ludites and backwards and in effect.
2074500	2076260	Tortoise lovers.
2076260	2079620	I was just me riffing about like like like like how do you unplug
2079620	2082780	from the fucking system when it's so pervasive?
2082780	2085820	But like that the solution would be unplug from the system
2085820	2088820	and truly look at the world around you and start acting.
2088820	2092060	And then and and let the example that you live with your life
2092700	2094780	start inspiring people to do the same.
2094780	2098740	And there will probably fire will catch, you know, if it's if it's fire.
2098740	2100980	We aren't here if it's not fire worth catching.
2100980	2105540	Fuck it. Then you lived your life happy and effectively until doomsday happened.
2105540	2108540	And if it but if it is worth catching, it's not going to catch by you
2108540	2112260	signing in to move on.org and RSVPing to a thing that texts you
2112260	2116060	when it's convenient to drop off the kids and show up for a sit in. Right.
2116060	2118220	I really should start a business.
2118220	2122220	That's what you guys are saying. Start a business like a child watch thing
2122220	2123660	for protests. Right.
2123660	2125020	I mean, that's essentially what they've created.
2125020	2128180	They created a they created a list that you can RSVP to because they want,
2128180	2134820	you know, so that we can create a nationwide within 24 hour rapid response.
2134820	2139700	However, symbolic to this event that the attempt on the enemy's part
2139700	2141220	is to just let it happen.
2141220	2144420	And and you're you're you're nothing.
2144420	2146540	It's not it's invisible.
2146540	2149980	It just happens and nothing happens because you can't do anything.
2149980	2152380	And we just we just we're just girding our loins
2152380	2154260	because we at least want to say called it.
2154260	2156540	We called this like don't fucking do it.
2157300	2159340	Maybe it's important at least just to take that posture
2159340	2163100	and just stand over that plate of cookies and look at that little sociopath
2163500	2166740	with the chocolate all over his face and the dog's leg in his back pocket
2166740	2169580	and go, I'm watching you, Toby, I'm not your parent,
2169580	2171740	but your fucking mom shouldn't have brought you here.
2171740	2175580	And you're you you you you watch too much television or.
2176900	2179580	Well, so I think I think there's multiple choices.
2179660	2182860	Well, so I think that you you bring up a good point, like the desire,
2182860	2185220	the intense desire to be like you're fucking wrong.
2185220	2186300	Everybody knows you're wrong.
2186300	2187500	You're a fucking asshole.
2187500	2190740	And I hate you. And everybody deserves to watch you fucking.
2190780	2193580	Your pants fall down around your ankles and you don't trip and fall off a bridge.
2193580	2194740	We all want to see that.
2194740	2197300	But my thing is like, let's look at power.
2197460	2199740	Let's look at materially how these things affect us.
2199940	2204140	If Trump is forced to resign and Mike Pence becomes president materially,
2204300	2206540	our lives aren't going to be that much different.
2206740	2210140	Now, we're not going to be bombarded by psychic hatred
2210140	2214100	and grotesque awfulness from the news all the time because that sounds really,
2214100	2216340	really nice. It sounds really nice.
2216340	2218340	Wait, wait. Our lives are going to be different
2218340	2221860	because Pence has positions that are worse than Trump's.
2221860	2224220	Pence does have some positions that are far worse than Trump
2224220	2227180	as far as his actual belief of his own religious zealotry,
2227180	2229740	like leads to some really crazy shit.
2229740	2233700	And you saw like an AIDS breakout in Indiana, which makes no sense
2233700	2235660	because nobody fucks there.
2235660	2238260	And then that's just how bad of a governor he was.
2238900	2240140	Says it on the license plate.
2240140	2242060	Yeah, it is. Yeah, we're the worst.
2242060	2247020	So but like materially,
2247260	2251020	what can where can we we're only strong when we come together, right?
2251020	2252180	We're only strong when we come together.
2252180	2255940	Collective power like any of us individually can't do shit.
2255940	2258140	That's like the net neutrality thing. Right.
2258140	2259180	And I also disagree.
2259180	2262980	I don't think we can do just like boycotts or like economically based.
2263180	2267860	We need to look at how power is leveraged and how we coming together.
2267860	2270420	I think the women's march is really good because it allowed a bunch of people
2270420	2273220	to come together and go, hey, you want to fight for this?
2273220	2274140	I want to fight for this.
2274140	2276100	Let's like get to know each other and figure this out.
2276100	2279500	So the next time there's a mass movement, there are demands
2279500	2282740	that we all agree on to raise no money.
2282740	2284820	Did they see? Here's the thing.
2284820	2288540	Had they raised some money that day for like any female charity?
2288780	2290460	I might be super impressed.
2290460	2292020	But like money, I am impressed.
2292020	2294140	I'm impressed by us all showing up.
2294140	2298700	But I'm getting real tired of us trying to buy our way out of the shit
2299140	2303380	by sending somebody to a broken ass Congress or to a broken political system.
2303580	2305500	Well, we know goddamn well
2305500	2308700	that if we had spent five bucks on the motherfucker next to us,
2308860	2310580	we wouldn't be in this situation.
2310580	2313180	That is, at the end of the day, the thing that you can do.
2313380	2316900	You can get as mad as you want to about court systems in Congress
2316900	2320460	and the political sphere and the president and the fact that third party voters
2320460	2324140	did this and the Republicans did that, or you can actually reach down.
2324380	2327020	Make sure the motherfucker within who's right in front of you
2327740	2330700	is eating how we done that in the first place.
2330700	2332020	We wouldn't be victims.
2332020	2334060	But now they're trying to scare us every week.
2334060	2336100	They come out with I'm moving this to Jerusalem.
2336100	2337220	I'm doing this shit.
2337220	2339020	They do and half the shit they tell us they're going to do.
2339020	2340300	And they got us scared.
2340300	2342740	You don't scare me by telling me you're about to pull the cord
2342740	2344300	on my motherfucking Internet.
2344300	2346380	You scare me when you're at my front door.
2346380	2348900	I think they will be at our front door soon.
2348900	2352700	So when I look at all this Internet shit, I'm like, you are joking
2352820	2354140	that we're upset about it.
2354140	2356660	FBI Russia motherfucker.
2356660	2361100	They killing more black dudes every fucking month this year.
2361100	2362740	You talking to me about Russia.
2362740	2365020	Y'all motherfuckers can't even get one white dude
2365580	2367340	and you killing black people innocently.
2367340	2369460	And I'm supposed to be upset about Mueller.
2370020	2371340	I know what's coming.
2371340	2373500	I know exactly what the fuck is coming.
2373500	2376020	And it's not going to be Internet neutrality shit.
2376380	2378260	It's not going to be FBI shit.
2378260	2380820	My ass is close to getting rounded the fuck up.
2381260	2383780	So when I look at the big picture,
2383780	2385260	I don't care who you all got in the White House.
2385260	2387380	If you motherfuckers don't pull the boot off my neck
2387900	2390740	and my voice just cracked too.
2390740	2393140	Plus, we're all wearing ridiculous things on our heads.
2394180	2399060	You can see mine and I can see yours, but we can't see our own.
2402100	2404540	There's a clip of you with the radio motherfucker.
2404540	2406780	Tell me what it is.
2406780	2409340	We are here trying to fly for Santa.
2409340	2410540	Rudolph is drunk.
2410540	2411620	Not to detract from that.
2411620	2413580	That was very well said.
2413580	2417980	You know, I I don't I don't see I I'm not going to.
2418020	2420380	I feel like I diminish what you just said.
2421540	2423460	By saying, I get it.
2423460	2426140	Yeah, I don't I don't.
2426140	2429020	I it waters it down for me to say I get it.
2429020	2430940	Like, I don't fucking get all of it.
2430940	2435340	I I I get that I don't get it when you talk like that.
2436300	2439060	I get that that there is a bigger picture here.
2439300	2443260	I always like from the very beginning, like, you know,
2443260	2447060	the day after the election, you know, a huge part of the wallpaper
2447060	2450660	in this redecorated room was, you know, OK,
2450980	2455180	white people who have never complained about anything except for maybe
2455180	2458340	that SpongeBob's movie wasn't had had had, you know,
2459740	2462140	anti feminist overtones in the second act,
2463500	2466260	that the frozen girl's skirt was too slit when she sang.
2466260	2467540	Actually, that's an opinion of mine.
2467540	2470260	I find that a very, very disempowering film.
2470860	2473340	Um, just high heels and sequins.
2473340	2474940	And I said, let let let what go?
2474940	2476540	She's let nothing go. Yeah.
2476540	2477580	She can barely walk.
2477580	2480020	It's freezing and the ice is like everywhere.
2480020	2482220	How can you walk in heels like that?
2482220	2485380	Those shoes have one purpose, OK, to make your ass look better for me.
2485420	2487580	That's it. You can't tell me that you're by yourself
2487580	2489180	and you're running around in those heels. Right.
2489180	2491860	Let it go. Let it go, girls.
2492020	2496140	Put on some sensible hugs that I can really get turned on by maybe some tights.
2498620	2500060	Yeah, the deck is loaded.
2500060	2502700	So I just I just don't find high heels attractive.
2504580	2506940	All right. So so so God damn it.
2506940	2508100	What did I do there?
2508100	2511300	The the the it was it was always about like,
2512860	2515340	you know, we joked about it.
2515340	2517860	I mean, no one was over it, but it was like basically the general,
2517860	2521260	the very, very like joking way to put it was like, you know, what?
2521260	2522860	We're on the bench at this point.
2522860	2526580	Like you speaking on behalf of black people like like your turn.
2526660	2528340	Like, let's see what you're going to do
2528340	2532140	if you're really that upset about this and what you're going to do.
2532140	2535340	And and and it's been a year and we don't do a lot.
2535340	2537620	Not not a lot. Not a lot has changed.
2537620	2539060	Motherfuckers say they want to do.
2539060	2541700	We're doing we're getting we've got we've got our shorts on.
2541700	2544620	And it's like our you can see the tan lines for like,
2544620	2545740	because we'd never wear shorts.
2545740	2550500	And then we're like, we're like we're we're obsessed with things like whistles.
2550500	2554500	And like we don't we we're trying to get the referees.
2554500	2558060	There's a lot of stretches that we haven't played in a really long time.
2558060	2559380	We've been on the bench for a while.
2559380	2561700	And that's true. It's hard to mobilize or whatever.
2561700	2565060	The version of the bench is the box, the fucking box where you run the game.
2565060	2566100	Well, that's what yoga is.
2566100	2568420	It's us stretching, getting ready for the race war.
2568420	2571020	And it's just like constantly we're just stretching.
2571020	2574740	Really, we're going to get we're going to be in the right physical stature
2574740	2576860	to, you know, fight the drones.
2577460	2582220	Perhaps we could expound on my unfortunate professional sports metaphors
2582220	2588020	for ethnic demographics by bringing up our ghost of Christmas pass.
2588580	2591180	It's I hear it on the rooftop.
2591180	2594180	I hear strange, mysterious
2594300	2595820	clickings and tappings.
2595820	2601220	Could it be DeMaurge Brown?
2603220	2606020	What a Christmas episode.
2607740	2609860	He was making the clicking and tapping and clapping.
2615140	2616780	Oh, hi. Hello, DeMaurge.
2616780	2618300	Hi. How are you, DeMaurge Brown?
2618300	2619460	I'm so good to see you, buddy.
2619460	2621100	Good to see you, man. I haven't seen you in a long time.
2621100	2622900	Too long. Too long.
2622900	2625020	You look so so distinguished.
2625220	2626020	Really? I wish I could.
2626020	2627860	I wish I could bring it in like that with the rich.
2627860	2629820	Oh, where have you been?
2632220	2634540	I don't think we tell him what we told him where we went.
2635500	2637300	Oh, I just kept going.
2637540	2640900	He kept going to Melbourne Sundays.
2640900	2642460	I'm looking for the fans.
2642460	2645540	He's going to bring a bag of lunch.
2646260	2648340	And I guess why for the good.
2649900	2652060	No, no, no, no, I just.
2654580	2657700	I worked on a short film a long time ago, which actually just came out
2658060	2662420	and the preparation for it started right before the last time that I did the show.
2662740	2664660	And it's probably about three and a half weeks worth of prep.
2665980	2669020	And then shooting the film took about a week, two weeks.
2670660	2671780	And then from there, yeah.
2671780	2674300	How was it? How was shooting?
2674740	2675340	Shooting was great.
2675340	2677260	I felt called.
2677260	2678740	I was there, too. Yeah.
2678740	2680540	Joey is so and it's a short film.
2680540	2683500	It's just came out this week is short of the week.
2683500	2684380	And it's on no budget.
2684380	2686100	Kentucky Bradley's no budge dot com.
2686100	2687300	That kind of stuff.
2687300	2688940	So that's great. Yeah.
2688940	2690140	The mortgage is great tonight.
2690140	2691260	Oh, awesome. All right.
2691260	2692900	Well, we'll check it out then.
2692900	2695620	I just wanted to get it vetted.
2695620	2698460	But it was like I mean, that started a run of just sort of.
2700220	2703740	You were like, well, I'm sure we're claiming your Sunday space for three weeks.
2703740	2705580	You're like, why am I good? What am I? What was I doing?
2705580	2706980	We get my Sundays back.
2706980	2708700	Yeah. Yeah.
2708700	2713420	I mean, if I took a couple of breaks from the show, I'd definitely be like, yeah.
2713420	2716180	What if I waited until I'm ready to do the show?
2716180	2720460	So what the guest, the last guest was somebody
2720460	2722180	who was incredibly important to me in my life.
2723540	2725980	It was a cheese Norman Lear.
2725980	2727780	It was Norman Lear. That was the last guest.
2728460	2734660	And I wanted desperately to be called up to to talk to him,
2734660	2737180	to even say that or ask him questions or something like that.
2737180	2739500	And I didn't and I didn't get called up until the very end.
2739500	2741460	I think he had just left. Who was it?
2741460	2743740	It was Norman Lear. Was it really? Oh, it was Norman Lear.
2743740	2746140	I got to hang out earlier in the green room with him.
2746140	2748420	And it was like devastated.
2748420	2751980	I was just like, geez, man, you have when I swarmed him
2752660	2756060	and he kind of just deflected it with with Jedi sensibility and stuff.
2756060	2759380	And it was but it was really fun and it was great to have had.
2759380	2761900	So it was sort of it was a high note of that year.
2762020	2767220	But you were it was it was it was a wound to you that I didn't call you up or.
2767740	2772980	No, it was just it was just a disappointment that it didn't get up to.
2772980	2775580	But that's not up to you. That's that's up to fate.
2776060	2778980	You were like, if I can try putting words in your mouth and correct me if I'm wrong.
2779540	2784700	After that, you were like, well, no, I felt like why am I going?
2785580	2788620	If in the best case scenario, like I might not even.
2788620	2791460	It was just weird because there were things he said when you first
2791460	2793660	when you first brought him out and interviewed him
2793660	2796660	that echoed things I said in the first time I'd ever been on Harmontown
2796660	2799940	about like the fact that we don't teach civics and the consequences of that
2799940	2802180	are going to kick us in the fucking butt.
2802180	2805260	And sure enough, we got to October and we got kicked in the boat
2805260	2808420	because people thought that this vote was a rubber room.
2809140	2813660	And, you know, they could go, oh, well, Hillary, guess what?
2813660	2816220	We're going to stick it to you by not voting for you.
2816220	2818860	And then like it was a prom prom court.
2818940	2821540	Yeah, yeah, it was like some kind of weird, weird ass situation
2821540	2824140	that we can easily sort of jump out of.
2824140	2827260	But yeah, but it wasn't.
2827260	2829260	No, it wasn't about that. It was just like it was just the fate of the day.
2829260	2832580	That was all I thought it was a highlight of my year, really,
2832580	2837460	to have been anywhere around that guy, just to favorite Norman Lear stuff.
2837660	2841220	But you did mention not getting called up like the hiring of Paul Mooney.
2841220	2842540	Well, I didn't get caught as a writer.
2842540	2844540	I didn't get called up to be on the show.
2844540	2847980	So if in the event of my one of my heroes being on the show,
2847980	2851540	if it's possible for me to be stuck in the green room.
2851540	2855380	Yeah, I was just saying, man, I was but I was in the back one.
2855380	2857620	Come on, man, put me up there.
2857620	2859100	There were no seats.
2859100	2861620	There were no seats. And that guy feels too.
2861620	2865140	Yeah. And he and there was so much to say. Yes.
2865420	2868020	This just our normal year's death. I like the part where I.
2869020	2872060	I like that I echoed some of your thoughts.
2872060	2875220	I take that as a compliment. Yeah, yeah, it was it was important.
2875460	2878300	Or it was an accusation of biting biting your moves, you say.
2879060	2881380	You're you're you're like, did I did I?
2881540	2884220	The court will decide.
2885940	2888260	All right. Well, nothing, nothing crazy, nothing special.
2888260	2889900	Just working my ass off and really.
2889900	2892380	Well, you take it. Yeah, you'd taken like breaks before.
2892380	2893980	And then every time you come back, I go, where were you?
2893980	2894780	What did I do wrong?
2894780	2897100	And it's like the answers never, you know,
2897100	2900180	it never satisfies my narcissistic, like map of the universe.
2900180	2901820	Like it's some reason of your own.
2901820	2904980	But this was an especially long absence.
2904980	2910300	So I just just got to a point was I got I mean, I'm out here to be an actor
2910300	2912140	and to write and direct stuff.
2912140	2915580	And I'm just like trying to fill my year.
2915580	2918260	I mean, you know me, I just I fill my year up as much as I can
2918260	2920100	with as much stuff as I can.
2920100	2924380	And I've been working with a director because of these.
2924380	2926300	I signed a bunch of NDA's, so I can't say a whole bunch of shit.
2926300	2928300	But there's a director whose next film was coming out.
2928300	2930620	He'd won an Oscar and this was his next film.
2930620	2931820	And it was just sort of like.
2931820	2934180	Brett Ratner. Yeah, right.
2934180	2938340	It's Brian Singer is a video, you know, it's an Eddie Murphy project.
2938340	2942940	Yeah. But it was but it was just like several times over the course
2942940	2946180	of that year to try and get his next thing into shape
2946180	2947860	so they could shoot it, which they did.
2947860	2950620	And then the next thing was like, I had that.
2950620	2954540	I ended up working on a thing called the dress up the dress up game on TV.
2954540	2956780	Yes. And that took a big chunk of time.
2956780	2958260	And so that's it.
2958260	2961500	You know, it's just really I'm worn out right now at the end of the year,
2961500	2964460	like physically worn out, just year weary basically.
2964580	2967340	Well, maybe we could put some energy in your Christmas pants
2967340	2973180	with a visit from the Rudolph of the Harmon town
2973180	2982340	sleigh, Mr. Rob Schraub, the crazy Rob Schraub.
2982340	2986460	What a crazy guy.
2986460	2992780	The first appearance on Harmon down. Crazy Rob Schraub coming to the show.
2992780	2997820	Crazy. You'll remember him from old man, old man, old man walking.
2998740	3001500	He's the man that never stops.
3001500	3005580	So crazy. How are you, Rob?
3005620	3006700	Hello, Daniel.
3006700	3008980	What have you been doing during DeMorges absence?
3008980	3011580	Why is this about me?
3011580	3013780	Oh, I don't know.
3013780	3019060	Just been kind of hanging out, watching a lot of television,
3019660	3022940	spend some quality time with my dog.
3023140	3026500	Been eating, eating a lot of carbs.
3028900	3033660	White rice chips, plain, plain white rice,
3034820	3037220	plain white rice.
3037220	3040260	And soda.
3042180	3046020	All right. Rob Schraub.
3046420	3048020	It doesn't that isn't that crazy?
3048020	3051020	How do you make rice, Rob? Isn't that crazy?
3051020	3054660	I order it from Eat 24.
3055460	3057860	You should really get it from Asia.
3057860	3061140	That's it. I don't know where eat 24 gets it from.
3061580	3063580	Maybe they get it from Asia.
3063940	3066340	Mm hmm. I asked.
3067140	3068780	Do you share it to do?
3068780	3070020	No, you can't have any.
3070020	3071020	No, I didn't want to.
3071020	3073020	I just thought maybe I ate it already.
3073020	3075180	OK. Good to know.
3075180	3079060	Eat 24 gets it from really inhumane rice farms, factory farms.
3079060	3079740	You don't know that.
3079740	3084020	Where the rice is forced to watch itself masturbate.
3084020	3086420	I heard it's not inhumane rice farms.
3086420	3088460	It's literally human rice farms.
3088460	3090220	Oh, have a cookies.
3090220	3091660	Are you sure that's a vegan one?
3092300	3093980	Vegan rice is good, right?
3093980	3095740	Saved your shit, brother.
3095740	3096740	Thank you.
3097580	3100380	Almost ate some cruelty.
3100380	3103100	Rob, how did you think the black voters did in Alabama?
3103100	3105580	I think I think you know something.
3106260	3108020	I think they did a really good job.
3110220	3111220	So brave.
3112180	3115580	My dad, they did a fantastic job.
3115620	3120300	It was a big election for for for for us as I'm white people studying black people.
3120300	3124620	I'm sure black people are also studying black people, too, in the epilogue of the
3124620	3128820	election. But it's like there's there's just a lot of like white voter, black
3128820	3133740	voter talk all over all of the podcasts and all of the analysis, which is really
3133740	3139340	interesting because the bad guys are there's conspiracy theories about buses
3139340	3147300	of people and then the end of the is there a in case any of you up here are black,
3147300	3148500	I don't see the world through that lens.
3148500	3155940	But what was your opinion, if any specific, like about the coverage that you heard
3155940	3160220	in the after the Alabama election, like in terms of people like I don't know, telling
3160220	3165740	the story. Like, was there anything offensive about it or is it all like they did it
3165740	3173020	great? I just like I'm just like, like, like listening to I was listening to Pod Save
3173020	3175420	America and listening to their their facts and figures.
3175420	3179820	It's just such a fascinating election because it's like you you couldn't have had any
3179820	3184900	prediction about it that wouldn't if you if you predicted that there was going to be
3184900	3191020	a a measurable victory on either side, then you would have been shocked by the fact
3191020	3194580	that it was like fucking ping pong ball on top of the net.
3194780	3201860	Yeah, if you predicted ping pong ball on top of the net, you know, how does it feel to
3201860	3207340	be that right? I mean, look at the president was set before that. I mean, you had in the
3207340	3215900	first Obama election, he steadily gained ground, gained momentum, demonstrated impact,
3215940	3224380	control, grace, fought off Hillary, even in her weird contentious sort of giving up of
3224380	3230100	the nomination. And then you get you get to this dismount that the Republicans said they
3230100	3236100	had the election. And this dismount they did, where they had, they were, they theatrically
3236100	3240500	revealed their vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and gave her a week to completely fuck that
3240500	3249260	up with I can see Russia, etc, etc, etc. And then the economy fell apart. And that can only
3249260	3255660	be blamed on the administration before it. And he still barely if you look at those numbers,
3255660	3260860	barely, barely, barely won that election. And then after four years where they didn't do
3260860	3269940	anything else really, to upend what the democrats have set in motion, he still, you know, I mean,
3269940	3275460	Romney really had to lose that last debate for the numbers to kind of switch around the way they
3275460	3279260	did at the end of that that second election. But that was all dependent on Romney really screwing
3279260	3284460	that up. So going into this one, in the end, you're and it's a home court. I mean, you're just
3284460	3291580	you're in Alabama. So how could that not be a ball on the net sort of victory where you're just
3291580	3296580	standing there? It's a net court victory was actually like, the interpretation is that the
3296580	3303020	ball on the net victory is like a huge, like come from behind, like landslide, like mobilization
3303020	3307500	effort for the for the left. I didn't see it as a come from behind. I mean, we knew everybody was
3307500	3313420	fighting for one thing in motion, but but the establishment that they were fighting against was
3313420	3318140	solid, was brick solid and was there and there was there's no way that was going to be a blowout
3318140	3323180	that was going to be as close as it was. We're all it was all execution dependent. Everybody is over
3323180	3329580	the moon happy with what happened. Well, not pedophiles, pedophiles are pretty upset with what
3329580	3335420	happened. And we also started the job. So in the black community, we'd already been familiar with
3335420	3341660	the more and the Jones race now for eight months a year, like on all your black female friends over
3341660	3345980	50 on Facebook, in the states that you're not even in, they were like, you're getting out the
3345980	3351180	conversation, the conversations being had people were mobilizing, you know, months ago. So even
3351180	3356140	though the media coverage just got to it, right, we'd already been like, we were voting to save
3356140	3360780	what little we have, you know, one of the numbers that meant anything to me were the the actual
3360780	3366780	percentage polls that were taken on key issues as voted by black women, which if you look at it,
3366780	3370620	it was sort of like, oh, there's no way they're having any of this bullshit. There was no
3370620	3376940	equivocating on that. That was all 97%, 97%, 9% percent. No, yes, no, yes. I can't think of
3376940	3381340	a scenario that bigger white guilt scenario than like watching this battlefield in the middle of
3381340	3386940	nowhere where there's like one guy is like, I want to fuck girls, little girls. And then like,
3386940	3392700	the other side is like, take that and their swords are like bouncing off of his pedophile
3392700	3396860	armor. And I'm just like watching it going like, well, this is strategic for us. This will
3396860	3402940	eventually inconvenience how much I wipe my ass with dollar bills or but and then and then there's
3402940	3408220	like to do to do and like like the elves and Lord of the Rings black voters come over the hill and
3408220	3414940	like and because of that we won. We beat a sex offender by 1%. It's like a scary moment where
3414940	3419900	you're like now I'm like, well, we're not going to do anything for the Alabama black families.
3419900	3423740	I am just going to take some wild guesses here. I don't think you're elves.
3425260	3431740	Thank you so much. I think that I have a feeling that their garbage doesn't get taken out very
3431740	3436060	quickly, that there that there's probably environmental like I don't know. It's probably
3436060	3441100	like a shitty life that's not that's kind of like a little bit disenfranchised. Is that is that
3441100	3444380	whatever? We don't we need a cross section of where we are right now, which is to say that
3445500	3450780	in stasis, these numbers are daunting. But in actuality, if you if you if you can
3450780	3457020	emphasize this thing, we are moving in the right direction. There's no gradient that's going to do
3457020	3460620	that. That's not predictive. So you kind of have to trust that that's where it's going.
3461660	3463660	It's not like I don't think that this country is breeding
3464540	3472780	rednecks at a rate that is commensurate with the way they were breeding them.
3472780	3477340	You know, true. And in the 1970s, man, you're like, that's well, yeah,
3477340	3485500	you're in total agreement with the negative. They regulated the redneck breeding companies.
3485500	3489260	And now they got all got to be free range. So you're getting fewer rednecks.
3489820	3494860	And yeah, that's more expensive. You got to pay for all those opiates.
3494860	3497420	And you guys know, I don't see your race when I talk to you, right?
3498700	3502780	I don't think that your spokesman for I'm not going to sit here for the mamification of America.
3502780	3507820	Black women didn't save you. We don't work for you. Everybody want to lean over all black women,
3507820	3511980	black women. Ninety four percent of that vote was black man. But you still want to be racist,
3511980	3518060	even in your compliment. Four percentage points. And think about that.
3518060	3522460	I'm going to agree with the reindeer on my left. All the brothers that weren't incarcerated
3522460	3526460	weren't ex felons. We lose so much of our voting ability to begin with.
3526460	3530460	So for 94 percent to show up, that's pretty that's pretty damn impressive.
3530460	3532780	Trued off the red nose reindeer, dude. Hell, yeah.
3532780	3535900	I can only run the simulator in my head where if I was part of a group,
3537660	3542140	I could barely be bothered to vote when I was like, yeah, so it's pretty crazy.
3542140	3546540	But like, what are we fucking like? It's like I'm voting for more peanuts in my shit.
3547180	3550940	Like because technically that's nutrition. Like I would be.
3551660	3555580	Yeah. All right. Well, we can we can drop all that behind. That's not it. I don't excel when
3555580	3560220	I'm talking about this stuff. I just wanted to mark the history of it. Spencer, how are you doing?
3560220	3565420	Are you don't don't take my cue. Oh, how are you doing? Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you.
3565420	3569580	Oh, I thought you were like taking a cue that I was bored with the discussion. No, no, no.
3569580	3574540	I and I was I accidentally I accidentally policed you for texting during the podcast.
3574540	3579260	It's great. And I feel properly policed. And I'm never going to.
3580620	3583100	So how are you guys doing? I'm doing OK.
3585500	3591500	I've just been I went to the Apple store to get an iPad. Oh, yeah. You had to get my iPad fixed.
3591500	3596380	It was great because I went to get a four hour deep clean at the dentist. And you guys you guys
3596380	3603900	you guys talked to me about privilege. Listen, yeah. What's that look? What's that like?
3603900	3609580	A four feels great. What's a four hour deep cleaning? What's that like? I feel like it's
3609580	3614060	a scam. Like the more I think about it, the more it seems like you know what you need is
3614060	3619740	four hours of dentistry. Do they do it? Really? What are they doing to your teeth for used a
3619740	3626140	laser? They put each of them in a chamber each tooth. They went by quadrants. They did quadrants.
3626140	3628140	That's the way to do it in the mouth. Well, they
3628140	3635900	they they they went they went like they went like one side up down the other side.
3635900	3640380	What with what with what do you mean with what dental tools? What the fuck with what?
3640380	3644380	Well, what dental tools? There's a I can't see them. They're in my mouth.
3644380	3648380	Lasers are these lasers for hours. They brushed your teeth.
3648380	3653260	I am going to do quadrant. I am going to go with all your quadrants, Dan.
3654540	3657420	Starting with the upper left for four hours.
3657420	3662300	I asked about one because I fall asleep. Did you stay awake? Did you read anything?
3662300	3670460	I put a I put a Brian Eno song for that was 45 minutes long on my on my iPad and you played it
3670460	3677660	four times. Yeah. Did you really? Well, but until the point where the iPad fell down and the plug
3677660	3683260	that it was plugged into the wall with a little lightning cable snapped off inside the charging
3683260	3689820	hole for the iPad, rendering it unchargeable. Oh, no. Oh, no. And tweezers. Oh, no. And when
3689820	3695100	I tell you Spencer couldn't get that thing out of there, he really couldn't. We were at a fucking
3695100	3701900	place that has the smallest tools in the world. And then you couldn't listen to your Brian Eno.
3701900	3707580	No, he could, but only for a limited time. Right. So for a limited time only.
3708380	3715580	Yeah. So talk to me about privilege for cord quadrants for four hours. Brian Eno. I asked
3715580	3720540	her motherfucker. I asked her what she was doing for one tool. I can answer your question because
3720540	3726860	there was a smell. There was smoke and a smell of the laser. Oh, shit. Your teeth are
3726860	3733900	disinfecting. Disinfecting the gums basically is like, you know, my guns are all fucking piled up
3733980	3741820	and filth is part of my teeth. So they had to like sand blast it and like take fishing hooks and
3741820	3750380	scrape all of the fucking brown sludge. There was a species of fucking amoeba in there. They
3750380	3757020	discovered I guess I'm going to make like 50 grand off of that at MIT or something. They named it
3757020	3763260	after me. There was like a horseshoe crab they found. They actually found evidence that during
3763340	3767980	the Industrial Revolution. So you're saying you're deep or dirty. You had some dirty teeth. These are
3767980	3772060	some dirty gums, folks. You had some dirty teeth there. You're saying you're deep or dirty. When
3772060	3775260	there's that much, I guess there's something about the distance between your teeth. Oh, that shit,
3775260	3779740	you know, so they fucking sandblast my teeth. It took, I believe it would take four hours. It's
3779740	3786940	been 44 years since I fucking brushed my teeth. Basically, let's be honest. Yeah. How's it feel?
3786940	3792940	Yeah. Feels good. Feels amazing, right? Yeah. I'm going to do it again in 44 more years. Okay.
3792940	3796780	All right. That's how like Cody said, you're not going to brush your teeth like later that
3796780	3802860	night. I'm like, I just found out I can go 44 years. Do you mouthwash or gum?
3804060	3811100	Do I mouthwash my gum? Do you do mouthwash or chew gum so your breath doesn't smell like turd?
3811100	3815660	Or as tribe would say, do you mouthwash or gum? Do you mouthwash with gum?
3817420	3825260	I don't, I, well, I brushed my teeth in the morning. Okay. Great. End of story. We're done.
3825260	3833020	Is it? Look, I'm not a picture of oral health. I admit it. Like I don't want women to see inside
3833020	3839100	my mouth. They would marry me. I got shot in the eye with a laser on Friday. And at his dentist?
3839100	3845500	Yeah. At the dentist. No, because when he just walks into the dental room, like, yeah,
3845500	3851580	she was like, you get, you get some basic, not on purpose. Um, no, I went to the physical therapist
3851580	3856860	and they have a laser therapy by where they strap a laser onto a part of your body and shoot it with
3856860	3863420	lasers. And, uh, this is a game we played in the eighties. The strap was loose and it came loose
3863420	3868780	and I saw it coming loose and I saw it in the sense that it came loose and shot a laser into
3868780	3874620	my eye before I realized I should look away and not look at it. And then I fixed it, but I was
3874620	3879420	like, I don't, I was so embarrassed. Like I didn't want to tell anyone and it was like bad. I mean,
3879420	3885020	it was like, my eyes started hurting and like, it was definitely like when you look at the sun or
3885020	3890060	whatever and you get like a vision splotch. It was like, I was like, no good. I was like, man,
3890060	3895100	this would be amazing if I have to get an eye patch from this, but I think I'll be okay. But
3895100	3900220	it was bad. It was like, it was hurting for about two days. It's fine today. Is this the place that
3900220	3907020	cupped you? No, no, this is a physical therapy cup to you. No, not a cat. Just, uh, just, uh,
3907020	3912620	lasers. He's talking about cupping like lasers to like measure your posture or no. It's a,
3912620	3918060	it's a, it's a form of therapy. They, they shoot it with lasers. I think the idea is it stimulates
3918060	3923500	the tissue, but the thing is a medical laser is a stronger laser than normal lasers. And it was in
3923820	3928380	the medical lasers that they use to affect your tissue or the exact radiation or wavelength.
3928380	3933020	That's the worst for eyes. So you're going to have one whole guy. Yeah, it's going to be,
3933020	3939660	it's going to turn green and stuff. His eye, if it has to save its eyes, baby, well, it could lift a
3939660	3946540	car. Um, the, the, the, I just, I just don't understand lasers that hit your skin and then
3946540	3951100	they're like stimulating the tissue underneath it, but it goes through because my friend does this.
3951100	3956700	What? Uh, my friend does cupping and then she comes out and she goes, then she shows you,
3956700	3960540	shows me her back or whatever. And it just, they're rings like brews. Yeah. Like these
3960540	3964220	bruise rings that last. I'd talk about cupping, but I don't want to be cyber bullied. So
3966620	3970780	question with dog. Well, he's just trying to leave a paper trial for his,
3972380	3976060	no, it's a crazy thing. Oh, did your, you, you, you talked to a girl and she,
3976060	3981740	she got cupped. So she had bruises all over her. Oh, I failed the cup. I just, I don't,
3981740	3987020	I didn't understand. I don't understand that. I don't know what it is. Of course he does.
3987020	3990220	Yeah. You want to talk to him about it. It's supposed to engage your lymphatic
3990220	3993580	system supposedly. It sort of pulls the toxins to the surface of the skin.
3993580	3999020	Right. Then your lymphatic system kind of gets rid of them because it sounds like leeches.
3999020	4004460	How does a laser, how does a laser, I don't understand that electromagnetic radiation
4004460	4010220	goes through most objects generally. So I think it's in a wavelength that is thin enough or wide
4010220	4015740	enough to go through your tissues and doing so it's like a low rate way microwave. And so I think
4015740	4022060	it just damages the muscles and then that stimulates them enough to regrow or whatever.
4022060	4025180	That's the understanding. I don't know. It seems like it's supposed to be kind of like,
4025900	4029420	yeah, I don't know. Isn't that just what walking does?
4029420	4033100	I think a lot of stuff does that is strengthens your muscles.
4034460	4038620	So you don't need to do lasers. I mean, it's physical therapy.
4039420	4042300	I just want to know whether or not I should get lasers on my body.
4042300	4048060	I mean, you can buy a laser machine for yourself for a couple thousand dollars and do it. And I
4048060	4052940	think you really roid out. Hell yeah, dude. But you might go blind.
4052940	4057260	Has anyone, the laser guy already, does anyone have that as their identity?
4057260	4059660	I might try it out in the new year. You mean like in the Marvel universe?
4059660	4062940	No, in the real universe. All right. Right. Not the real universe.
4062940	4066700	Self cup. Yeah. Oh, man. If I could self cup, I'd never leave the house.
4066700	4069500	No one has seen new Star Wars. I know I've seen it.
4069500	4072620	And oh, no, I have seen it. What do you I love it.
4072620	4080140	Any company loved it. What about those porgs? What about guys, those porgs?
4080940	4086620	What about this Star Trek Quentin Tarantino movie everyone's talking about?
4086620	4090620	I hope there's porgs in it. Haven't heard of it.
4090700	4094060	Did you know when a dog sits and does that thing with his hind legs?
4094060	4098220	Moving on. Well, no, it's related. That's called a sploot.
4098220	4101420	A sploot. Wait, when they lay on their belly and their legs.
4101420	4105340	Yeah. And their back legs look like a chicken. Like a chicken on a plate.
4105340	4107180	A sploot. I like it.
4107180	4108540	Corgis. I like it.
4108540	4112220	Corgis do it. It's called splooting. Or is it just called engaging in a sploot?
4112220	4116300	Splooting around. All right. Well, yeah, but it was related to the porg thing. Rob, you can't...
4116860	4118300	Porgs sploot in the movie.
4118540	4120140	Yeah, I'm gonna have your girls sploot in the movie.
4120140	4123740	All right. Well, yeah, so isn't this the last Star Wars movie? Are they gonna keep making...
4123740	4126460	Yeah, no, this is the last one. They're done. All right.
4128220	4130460	Steve is upset. Never.
4130460	4137900	I watch people... I'm not in any... I don't judge anything at all. I'm about to turn 45,
4137900	4143180	and I'm just... I find it fascinating that Star Wars has gotten to this place where it's
4143180	4145980	just like this crazy... It's gotten really popular.
4148300	4155340	I remember when it was just this cult thing that just a few of us liked. Now everybody likes Star
4155340	4161340	Wars. I remember I was walking down the street a little kid with a Star Wars t-shirt on.
4161980	4163580	When was the last time this happened?
4171420	4173740	Well, I didn't... That's not what I was saying.
4173980	4178460	I was just talking about how it used to be... It was just a cultural
4179340	4182300	thing that it just kind of had a monolithic face to it. It was like,
4182300	4186220	yeah, that's the Star Wars movies. They come out every six years, and they're kind of
4186220	4190460	unquestionable, and you can pick and moan about whether you liked Empire or Star Wars better.
4190460	4197420	And now it's just this crazy weird Lego-like universe where there's one-offs and guest
4197420	4202540	directors. It's all called Star Wars, and it's amazing because it's the thing I gave the most
4202540	4207260	shit about ever. And I also have never seen a Transformers movie, and there's like nine of
4207260	4210700	those. And I really loved Transformers. Have you seen a new one?
4210700	4214380	I haven't seen any Transformers movie ever. No, the new Star Wars.
4214380	4216780	Star Wars? No, I haven't seen the new one, because I don't even know...
4216780	4220700	What you should do, honestly, is see the last Transformers movie,
4220700	4223740	because that was the biggest piece of shit I've ever seen in my life.
4223740	4225260	I keep waiting for the last one.
4228220	4230860	There's a dumb play on words. What's your...
4230860	4235820	The last one was amazing. Every summer, I do a thing where I just go see a bad movie a week,
4235820	4240620	because summer's loaded with them. And I usually go to the Highland Theater just because
4240620	4244140	families come, and they go, and they're the most responsive audience in the world.
4244140	4250380	And that last Transformers movie was crazy. And then right when we get to the point where...
4250380	4253100	Are you talking about the last... What do you mean when you say the last one?
4253100	4254620	There's one that just came out, and there's...
4254620	4258940	This summer, the one that just came out in July, or June or July, or whatever.
4258940	4260300	It's called The Lonely Jedi.
4261420	4262700	The last Transformers movie?
4262700	4264380	Oh, you're talking about the last Transformers movie?
4264380	4265580	I'm talking about the last Transformers movie.
4265580	4267020	Okay, all right. No, I haven't seen it.
4267020	4269820	Which Transformer movie are we talking about?
4269820	4270300	The last.
4270300	4270940	The last one.
4270940	4271580	Okay, all right.
4271580	4277980	This one is just... It's just crazy. There's 9,000 elements in it,
4278620	4282060	none of which get a full complete circle narrative dealing.
4282700	4287980	And then they just kind of mark these moments by chaos, chaos, chaos,
4287980	4289260	and then Wahlberg comes in and says,
4289260	4291980	Oh my God, you guys got to get over here and come and see this.
4291980	4294540	And then they'll cut it.
4294540	4300060	But then they'll cut to Anthony Hopkins, who just walk out of nowhere and kind of just be like,
4300860	4302860	Long ago, several years ago, Merlin.
4302860	4305580	I mean, this movie opens with... It opens with...
4305580	4306060	Merlin?
4306060	4308540	Merlin is riding a horse.
4308540	4311260	Merlin is riding a horse and he's fucking hammered.
4312300	4317740	And he stops the horse and then takes a swing.
4317740	4320540	Oh, he stops the horse and he looks into the camera and says,
4320540	4321740	I'm sozzled.
4321740	4324220	And then he pulls a bottle out and drinks from it
4324220	4329900	and then rides up an evergreen cliff to a cave in Ireland somewhere
4330620	4334540	where there is an original Transformer crashed and injured.
4336060	4336940	That's where it starts.
4336940	4338220	Does he throw his bottle down?
4338220	4339260	I go like, so good.
4339260	4342060	Wait, why does he break the fourth wall?
4342060	4343020	What's he doing?
4343020	4344380	Because he's so sozzled.
4344380	4345420	The movie is bad.
4345420	4346140	He's sozzled.
4346460	4347740	He really looks right at the camera.
4347740	4351100	There's an arcade of trees like this
4351100	4352540	and he's just riding down with a horse
4352540	4354380	and for no reason stops the horse.
4354380	4356140	And then you're like, why would you stop the horse?
4356140	4358060	And that's when he looks and he goes, I'm sozzled.
4358060	4359180	And then he pulls a trigger.
4359180	4360540	You didn't say it was the catchphrase.
4361420	4364220	There was all the I'm sozzled shirts and the sozzled things.
4364220	4366620	But this goes on for the whole length of the movie.
4366620	4370700	And then there's a cold open term,
4370700	4373580	but I guess there's a close, like an addendum at the end.
4376380	4378540	Shrav, if you need to go, you can go.
4380380	4381820	Shrav came to the podcast sick.
4384380	4385500	He's a little under the weather.
4387420	4388380	He's a little sozzled.
4391180	4391820	You don't have to.
4394220	4395500	Why you gotta sit next to me?
4398860	4399180	All right.
4399180	4399980	So note to self.
4399980	4402540	Let's shuffle the order of the guests in the chair.
4402540	4404460	But also, Last Jedi I looked.
4404540	4406380	I have an activity we can play for Christmas.
4408060	4412700	Socialist Santa has brought some games, some games.
4413340	4414860	Yes, actually, I will leave.
4418140	4419500	Well, Shrav doesn't like games.
4419500	4422140	That's why it's not that he doesn't like Santa or socialism.
4424540	4426380	Yeah, you can come back one hour.
4429500	4430220	They're so good.
4430780	4433820	So basically, what I was thinking of when I came up with these games
4433820	4437740	is that we're all going to be with our families and talking about politics.
4437740	4440380	And that's going to suck and lead to a bunch of arguments.
4440380	4443020	And so why don't we turn it into a game?
4443020	4444300	Okay, because people love games.
4444300	4445660	Jimmy Fallon loves games.
4446300	4449740	So let's all be a little more like Jimmy Fallon this holiday season.
4449740	4454300	Yeah, and and so I can get a jump on my New Year's resolution.
4454300	4456540	Yeah, doing a bunch of coke and drinking a lot.
4456540	4459420	Um, so that's like well known, right?
4459420	4459900	I don't know.
4462220	4463500	Jimmy Fallon's a sad person.
4463580	4471340	Anyway, this first game we're going to play is called pot strain or horrifying government
4471340	4472620	operation code name.
4473420	4477900	And the way this games work, the way this game works is I'm going to name a thing
4477900	4482620	and it is either a pot strain or a possible war crime.
4482620	4484540	And you have to tell me the difference.
4484540	4489180	Okay, and so you can get bonus points if you've actually smoked the weed in question.
4489180	4490140	That's honor system.
4490940	4495020	Or if you guess what the operation was about.
4495900	4497820	Okay, and here we go.
4497820	4500700	Starting with number one, Asian fantasy.
4502380	4503740	Asian fantasy.
4503740	4505580	How do we buzz in or whatever?
4505580	4507740	I think you just did government.
4508780	4509420	Incorrect.
4510300	4511420	It is a pot strain.
4512940	4514300	Let's do another one.
4514300	4515820	All American Tiger.
4518300	4519820	Government operation.
4520140	4520860	That is correct.
4521820	4522540	This game is great.
4522540	4528540	It was to capture Saddam Hussein lookalikes, which that name All American Tiger totally
4528540	4531420	makes sense because Saddam Hussein was on the cover of Tiger beat.
4532620	4533180	The next one.
4533180	4535100	I want to know more about that operation.
4535100	4535900	They're trying to wrap.
4535900	4540940	Why were they trying to round up lookalikes of Saddam Hussein here in the States so that
4540940	4544060	we could drop them on Iraq and confuse everyone.
4545180	4546140	Please say a musical.
4546140	4547180	Please say a musical.
4547980	4549820	It was a musical honeypot.
4549820	4550860	That's exactly what it was.
4550860	4553500	They trained them how to sing and dance and then they wanted them to
4554060	4559340	know it was to round up all his lookalikes in Iraq to make sure that they weren't him.
4561580	4568540	So in other words, if he did have 50 lookalikes deployed, then that operation
4568540	4571260	that we gave a fancy name to was just really operation.
4571260	4572780	His operation is working.
4572780	4573260	Yes.
4573660	4576940	In his operation, there are too many guys that look like Saddam Hussein.
4576940	4580060	We're just playing the Captain Crunch contest with him like,
4580060	4581260	Oh, there's another one.
4581260	4583020	Let's grab him and spend time on this.
4583020	4588700	I imagine that that that mission involved like a CIA guy going like with two Saddam's
4588700	4590540	and the Saddam's like, it can't be me.
4590540	4591660	I can't be the real Saddam.
4591660	4592380	I don't know this.
4593420	4596940	It was like a Washington Post reporter has two of them cornered in a hotel lobby.
4596940	4598380	And it's like, Ron, it's me.
4598380	4599580	I was at your bar mitzvah.
4600380	4603420	I'm the only one that remember you have that mole on the inside of your leg.
4604780	4606060	OK, next one.
4606060	4608460	I don't want any emails about my Iraqi accent.
4609420	4610700	I think it was tasteful.
4613260	4614060	White rhino.
4615340	4616460	That's definitely a weed.
4616460	4617020	I've smoked.
4617020	4617420	Yeah.
4617420	4617980	Bonus points.
4617980	4619820	That is definitely a little bonus point.
4619820	4620780	You must have smoked that.
4620780	4621820	This is a socialist game.
4621820	4623260	So there are no winners or losers.
4623260	4624540	We all get the same amount of prizes.
4624540	4625180	Right.
4625180	4625580	Yeah.
4625580	4627820	Well, we should all even out our points eventually.
4627820	4628220	Right.
4628220	4628540	Right.
4628620	4631580	We just redistribute the points to those who don't have as many.
4631580	4632300	A hundred percent.
4632300	4633740	And I wish at midnight would have done the same.
4633740	4639020	White rhino is named that because it seems dangerous before you try it.
4639020	4642540	But it's only charging at you to get a closer look.
4642540	4642700	Yeah.
4646620	4648220	Or stamp out your campfire.
4651260	4651660	All right.
4651660	4652540	Next one.
4652540	4653660	Viking snatch.
4655740	4656860	Government operation.
4656860	4657580	Yeah.
4658300	4658940	That is correct.
4658940	4659260	Yeah.
4659260	4660460	And what do you think it was?
4661340	4662780	Rounding up a bunch of Vikings.
4663820	4665740	It must have been off the coast of an island.
4667420	4678380	Navy boats would go around the coast of Cuba and look for people trying to get away, pick them up,
4679100	4682140	hypnotize them into thinking they were happy Cubans and drop them back off
4682860	4685420	and activate them with a code phrase to assassinate Castro.
4685420	4687500	That is actually 100 percent correct.
4688140	4688780	No, no.
4688780	4690780	They gave Guy Ritchie movies to Iceland.
4690780	4693420	I think it was a white supremacist infiltration.
4694140	4695020	You're the closest.
4695020	4698140	It was to disrupt weapons smuggling by white supremacists.
4698140	4700220	Because white supremacists think they're fucking Vikings.
4700220	4701500	They love Vikings.
4701500	4702460	Viking snatch.
4702460	4703260	Isn't that crazy?
4703260	4707500	It's absurd how many guys that look like a lowercase letter B
4708140	4709740	think that they're a Viking.
4709740	4711580	They're like, yeah, I got all the same traits.
4713980	4714700	Next one.
4714700	4715260	Here we go.
4715500	4717740	This is the last one.
4718460	4719660	Rolling Thunder.
4719660	4720140	Oh, yeah.
4721020	4722620	That one I think I remember hearing.
4722620	4724140	That was a government operation.
4724140	4725980	That one I think I remember smoking.
4725980	4727420	Did you say it's a train?
4727420	4728780	Government operation.
4728780	4729500	Folks, it's both.
4731020	4732860	Just like socialism, there's no losers.
4732860	4733580	All right.
4733580	4733980	What?
4734860	4739100	What was the government operation?
4739100	4743020	All I wrote down in the notes was both bitch in all caps.
4743020	4744460	So I have no idea what that one is.
4744460	4745820	You were on the White Rhino.
4745820	4746320	Yeah.
4748220	4749660	I have another game if you'd like to play.
4749660	4750300	Love games.
4750300	4752460	That one was fast and fun.
4752460	4753100	There we go.
4753100	4753820	All right.
4753820	4756220	This game is called Secret Republican,
4756220	4758380	rape apologist, or animal phobia.
4758380	4760140	Jesus Christ.
4760140	4761820	So here's how this game works.
4761820	4764460	Now that a reality TV host is president,
4766220	4769900	the politics of our nation's most valuable resource,
4769900	4772780	celebs, is more important than ever.
4772860	4774940	Because which one of them might run for president?
4774940	4776380	Any one of them could run for president.
4776380	4777660	So we're vetting.
4777660	4778620	We are now vetting.
4778620	4781340	Because if you are a secret Republican
4781340	4783580	and you run for Democratic office,
4783580	4784540	you're going to get caught.
4784540	4786940	If you're a rape apologist, you're going to get taken down.
4786940	4789420	And if you're afraid of one specific animal,
4789420	4790940	y'all are going to get roasted.
4790940	4794460	So we're just trying to clear the herd for 2020.
4795180	4796460	Shout out to Matt Damon.
4796460	4797500	Shout out, Matt Damon.
4798700	4799020	All right.
4799020	4799980	So here we go.
4799980	4802300	Again, you have to tell me if they hide the fact
4802300	4804860	that they're in the GOP, have publicly defended a rapist,
4804860	4807180	or have a deep-seated fear of a specific animal.
4807180	4807660	OK.
4807660	4808780	And I made a name as celebrity.
4808780	4812380	Can I get a little bit of guessing music, maybe?
4813900	4815020	This one's going to be tough, because I
4815020	4817900	think we've all publicly defended the rapists and stuff.
4817900	4818400	You know.
4820380	4822220	Man, I used to have the soundtrack
4822220	4823500	for The Price is Right.
4823500	4825100	It was so great.
4825100	4827740	Driving around, playing that Price is Right music.
4827740	4829980	But then if you did something wrong and you heard,
4830140	4831340	boom, boom, boom.
4831340	4833180	I got in a car accident and that happened now.
4833180	4833980	Yep.
4833980	4834620	All right.
4834620	4835100	Here we go.
4836460	4838380	Just when you thought it was safe to guess.
4838380	4840940	Just when you thought it was safe to like a celebrity.
4841980	4843820	Number one, Adam Sandler.
4845740	4846700	Adam Sandler.
4846700	4848460	Secret Republican, we know this.
4848460	4848940	Correct.
4850940	4852860	Not sure anybody in his circle has raped.
4852860	4854380	So I don't think he's a rape apologist.
4855180	4856140	No, it's just Secret Republican.
4856140	4857260	You're correct.
4857260	4858940	And I'd also like to guess the last one.
4858940	4859740	What is it?
4859740	4861340	No, no, it's it's animal.
4862700	4864780	No, I'd like to guess the last one.
4864780	4866940	See, you know, rape, rape Republican.
4867980	4868780	What is the last?
4869820	4870540	Yes, you're right.
4870540	4870780	Correct.
4870780	4871740	He's in the GOP.
4871740	4873260	Okay, next.
4873260	4873820	All right.
4873820	4874860	Kristen Stewart.
4876540	4878540	Well, she's got to have an animal phobia
4878540	4880380	because everyone likes her.
4880380	4880940	That's correct.
4880940	4881980	She's afraid of horses.
4882780	4884860	Kristen Stewart's afraid of horses are scary.
4885420	4886140	Horses are scary.
4886140	4886860	They will bite you.
4886860	4887740	That's my favorite animal.
4887740	4890940	They'll they'll they could do whatever they want to anybody.
4891900	4894300	I mean, I also I was thinking of Christian Wig.
4895020	4897580	No, Kristen Stewart sucks and she shut down my show,
4897580	4899340	Babe Island, my old comedy show.
4899340	4902700	Well, case two, I had your back accidentally.
4903900	4906300	Hey, Wig, you're next quick.
4906300	4907180	Whoopi Goldberg.
4908460	4911180	Oh, we know she's a big RA.
4911180	4914940	Yeah, dude, she defended Bill Cosby like way after.
4914940	4921260	And on the view, like maybe the view isn't the right place to talk about Bill Cosby.
4921260	4923660	I don't think we're doing the music the way you imagined us.
4923660	4924780	No, I think it was right.
4924780	4926140	That was that was a peek.
4926140	4929180	That was a maybe the view is not the place to apologize for Bill Cosby.
4929180	4934220	It was the great climax of the I liked how that lined up.
4934220	4936380	Yeah, I got two more.
4936380	4937020	Let's do it.
4937020	4938220	Katie Holmes.
4938220	4938780	Oh, man.
4939340	4940300	What are the choices?
4940300	4940620	Right.
4940620	4944300	Apologist, secret Republican or animal phobia.
4944300	4946460	Well, we haven't had a rape apologist yet, so I'll take that.
4946460	4947020	Whoopi Goldberg.
4947020	4947660	Whoopi Goldberg.
4947660	4948540	Oh, she OK.
4948540	4949340	She defended Bill.
4949340	4950300	OK, OK.
4950300	4951180	Secret Republican.
4953660	4955900	The correct answer is she's afraid of raccoons.
4955900	4958220	It's because they've got some right.
4958220	4959260	They've got the little hands.
4959260	4960780	They look just like ours.
4960780	4962220	The rest of them don't look like us.
4962220	4963820	There's only two kinds of people in this world.
4964460	4969660	People that are afraid of raccoons and people with a distinct raccoon wound somewhere on their face.
4969660	4971900	Right.
4971900	4974460	Those little fuckers are like monkeys with no conscience.
4974460	4975180	They're monsters.
4975980	4977260	They're like street monkeys.
4978860	4980380	They're monkeys that live in your backyard.
4980380	4981180	This is not good.
4981180	4982380	Street monkeys.
4982380	4983260	This is terrible.
4985260	4990540	One of those fuckers is that raccoon kept coming in through our doggy door and eating the dog food.
4993260	4994460	I've talked about this on podcasts.
4995340	5000460	When you discover a raccoon, when you come upon one, they stare you down.
5000460	5001740	Yeah, they just look at you.
5001740	5006940	The skunks do that too, but skunks are freezing and saying, are we going to have to do this?
5007500	5010620	I have things I can do to avoid the conflict.
5010620	5012540	Raccoons are like, what?
5014220	5014700	Yeah.
5014700	5015740	They're like, what?
5016700	5018780	Do you feel lucky punk and all that stuff?
5018780	5019980	They just look at you.
5019980	5023260	And then the two times I've encountered a raccoon,
5023900	5028060	I hold up my hands to try on every weapon, and I back away.
5028060	5035580	And the raccoon just kind of like elevator looks me and walks away, shaking its hips.
5036140	5036460	All right.
5036460	5037580	Anyways, scary animal.
5037580	5040780	I love that you showed an animal with hands, your hands, so that you could get out of there.
5042060	5042700	Look, you have hands.
5042700	5043980	You know I'm not holding a weapon.
5043980	5044700	We've both got hands.
5044700	5052940	But I'm really scared because if you Google raccoon dog, I've got a situation.
5053740	5055660	I'm a really irresponsible dog dad.
5055660	5062700	I need a lockable doggy door because my dogs are primed to get a fucking face mauling.
5063500	5064860	And I feel bad about that.
5064860	5065580	Yeah.
5065580	5066860	And they get big in our neighborhood.
5066860	5067420	They're big.
5067420	5069500	I think the coyotes ate those raccoons, so.
5070140	5075740	Yeah, I think we eventually kind of scared them off with coyote pee.
5075740	5079260	We hung coyote pee from the chimney with care.
5079260	5080540	They just thought you were freaks.
5080540	5082060	You're like, why are they holding piss?
5082060	5083340	I don't want to hang out with them.
5083340	5084620	These people have bags of piss.
5084620	5085820	Does Ed Gein live here?
5085820	5086380	We're out of here.
5086940	5088940	I'm a raccoon, but this is fucking nuts, dude.
5088940	5090060	I'm out of here.
5090060	5093100	I love to eat trash all the time, but this is gross.
5093100	5094700	We started to set a humane trap.
5094700	5098300	We got a humane trap that has a weird door that you go in,
5098300	5099500	and then it closes behind you.
5099500	5100380	We put some food in it.
5100380	5102140	Next morning, the neighbor's cat is in there.
5103340	5103980	Fat fucker.
5104780	5105900	Last question.
5105900	5106540	Last one.
5107340	5108380	Ivanka Trump.
5109260	5111900	Oh, definitely a strain of weed.
5114700	5116300	Rape apologists are afraid.
5120140	5122220	Well, she's a...
5123100	5124060	Rape apology.
5124060	5126220	I mean, she's technically...
5126220	5127260	Yeah, she's a...
5127260	5129260	Wait, has she ever actually said...
5129260	5130380	Is she all three?
5131900	5133580	She's all three, baby.
5134220	5135980	She likes to pretend that she's not a Republican,
5135980	5137340	but she definitely is.
5137340	5139740	She's a rape apologist, and she's afraid of Pokemon.
5140860	5142460	That's not one animal.
5143340	5144140	That's all animals.
5144140	5145420	All right, so she's only two.
5145420	5145740	Okay.
5147580	5148060	Nice.
5148060	5149900	And that's a secret of two fucking...
5150860	5151340	Yay.
5152780	5157420	I got a game called the ham radio license exam practice test.
5158940	5160780	Okay, you guys want to play that?
5160780	5162060	Yeah, let's hear some.
5162060	5163820	Spencer's going to get his ham radio license.
5164620	5168220	Ever since the day that we went in to the place next door
5168220	5171820	to where it definitely did not take a lot of time to buy my gun,
5173340	5176540	and we've been trying to get Spencer a ham radio license,
5176540	5179580	and it's really, really hard, and he may never get it
5179580	5180700	because it's not a gun.
5181900	5184380	Right, if it was a gun, this would be over with ages ago.
5184380	5185500	Yes, I have been...
5185500	5188780	My gun has been collecting dust on my shelf for two months,
5188780	5192540	and Spencer is almost done maybe getting his ham radio license.
5192540	5193660	He got those things at the same time.
5193660	5195980	It's really dangerous to have a ham radio.
5195980	5199180	Yeah, think about all the businesses you could negatively impact.
5199180	5201660	Right, think of the children whose minds you could warp with,
5201660	5203340	you know, all the kids that are on ham radio.
5203340	5204700	What if you played music on it?
5205260	5205660	Right?
5205660	5206060	I don't know.
5207340	5208860	I don't know, I can't get Wi-Fi.
5209580	5211660	Hold on, keep going, sorry.
5211660	5213660	That's because you're not in the fast lane, honky.
5213660	5215260	Yeah, Net Neutrality is happening.
5216460	5219180	Net Neutrality already started, and this was ground zero.
5219820	5221180	Okay, are you ready for the first question?
5221180	5221900	They throttled us.
5221900	5223740	Of course they're going to throttle us first.
5223740	5224220	They heard us.
5224220	5226460	We get fucking people with antlers over here
5226460	5228140	talking about bringing down the curtain.
5228140	5231740	At that GOP convention, they caught someone on a hot mic saying,
5231740	5234140	yeah, we're already lining up rich conservatives
5234140	5235660	who are going to rig the internet.
5235660	5237180	Oh, boy, we're in for some time.
5237180	5238700	All I got to say is, here's the thing.
5238700	5241260	I may be a fucking fat, dumb, lazy guy
5241260	5243180	that hasn't studied anything since high school,
5243180	5246300	but here's my bird's eye view based on that.
5246300	5247900	The last thing I remember learning is,
5247900	5249500	here's the fascism playbook.
5249500	5253580	They have like a list of shit that they need to do
5253580	5256380	in order to swing a country fascist and take control of it.
5256380	5257980	And one of the top items on the list,
5257980	5260700	which has been the eternal frustration to these pricks,
5260700	5262540	is that because of the internet,
5262540	5264620	you can't do what the first step is,
5264620	5267260	which is just fucking take over the media.
5267260	5271100	You have to be able to black it out and just control it.
5271100	5273900	You can't have a free press and a fascist coup.
5273900	5275420	They don't work together.
5275420	5280060	So fascism really goes very quickly
5280060	5283980	in times when you can just go and firebomb a newspaper office,
5283980	5285420	and they haven't been able to do that.
5285420	5286860	Now they're fucking doing it.
5286860	5288060	It concerns me.
5288620	5290540	I don't want to have to find out what I'm made of.
5291340	5291820	You won't.
5291820	5293580	No, maybe you won't.
5293580	5294300	You got it.
5294300	5294940	I'm safe.
5294940	5296460	You're saying it's going to take so long.
5296460	5296940	I'm saying.
5296940	5298220	I'll have my first coronary.
5298220	5300140	You're from good fucking stock.
5300140	5300620	Thank you.
5301420	5302220	You know this.
5302220	5302860	That's what I'm saying.
5302860	5303420	What are you saying?
5303420	5303820	British.
5303820	5304460	Are you saying?
5304460	5305900	When they come through, you're going to fight
5305900	5306940	and you're going to win, bro.
5307500	5308940	That's what I'm trying to tell you.
5308940	5310620	Or we're all going to die from climate change
5310620	5312060	before they have a chance.
5312060	5312860	You mean good stock?
5312860	5314300	Like I have a hero in here somewhere?
5314300	5315580	Like I'm like a good person?
5315580	5317020	Are you being my magical black person?
5317020	5317900	Are you from Wisconsin?
5317900	5319020	Are you like my mentor?
5319020	5320220	Right?
5320220	5321740	Is that a place bullshit?
5321740	5324300	Or do hardy ass people who don't take shit?
5324300	5325100	I mean, what'd you guys do?
5325100	5325980	I can't beat anybody up.
5326060	5326780	Is that what you're implying?
5326780	5327580	What did you guys do?
5327580	5328860	Didn't you get rid of your governor?
5329500	5329980	I don't know.
5329980	5330700	We did some stuff.
5330700	5331100	Yeah, we did.
5331100	5333500	We had like a socialist mayor or something.
5333500	5335100	But we keep saying that over and over again.
5335100	5337260	But we're a bunch of Trumpy pumpies.
5337260	5337580	Yeah.
5337580	5339020	But you used to be blue?
5339020	5339660	I don't know.
5339660	5340540	Yeah, you did.
5340540	5341820	And then you got red.
5341820	5343660	And I bet you when we look at the big picture,
5343660	5344940	you're going to be red for a little while.
5346300	5347980	But you're going to be majority time blue.
5347980	5349900	This is a weird way to pump me up.
5349900	5350860	Wisconsin.
5350860	5352060	Wisconsin.
5352060	5352700	I left that place.
5352700	5353180	We believe in you.
5353500	5353980	Wisconsin.
5355580	5356540	It's your home.
5356540	5357020	All right.
5357020	5358300	You can't escape it.
5358300	5360460	What is a part 15 device?
5360460	5364220	A, an unlicensed device that may emit low-powered radio signals
5364220	5366620	on frequencies used by a license service.
5366620	5371660	B, a type of test set to use to return a type of test set used
5371660	5374540	to determine whether a transmitter is in compliance
5374540	5377660	with FCC regulation 91.15.
5377660	5378620	Oh, it's close.
5378620	5382060	C, a device for a long-distance communication using
5382060	5385100	special code sanctioned by the IARU.
5385100	5387820	And D, a type of amateur radio that can legally
5387820	5389740	be used in the citizens' band.
5389740	5390380	D.
5390380	5391420	I'm going to say C.
5392460	5395820	I'm going to say D because it had the phrase citizens' band.
5395820	5396220	There we go.
5396220	5399020	I'm going to do D, D, D2, part 15.
5399020	5401260	I'm going to say A because I'm taking the test.
5403900	5404780	There might be.
5404780	5408300	It was A because, yeah, an unlicensed device
5408300	5411100	that may emit low-powered radio signals on frequencies
5411100	5412380	used by a license service.
5412380	5415180	Based on my research, this includes walkie-talkies.
5415180	5416220	Oh.
5416220	5417820	So is that like kids' walkie-talkies?
5417820	5420940	Yeah, those operate on amateur radio bands,
5420940	5422700	but they have those privileges even though
5422700	5424220	they're commercial products.
5424220	5425340	How easy are those to hack?
5428380	5430380	I think they're built with a...
5430380	5433180	I mean, it's easy to make your own radio, I think.
5433180	5434460	I think that's easy enough.
5434460	5435180	But I don't think walkies are...
5435180	5436540	If you have enough Bitcoin.
5437740	5438220	Well, yeah.
5438220	5440460	I mean, these days, if you have enough Bitcoin.
5440460	5442060	There's a lot of Bitcoin in radio, dude.
5442060	5444220	There's a lot of money there.
5444220	5446380	Are you still eyeing up that Bitcoin?
5446380	5447500	I think I missed the boat.
5447500	5448540	I mean, I don't know.
5448540	5450060	Do you think it's here to stay?
5450060	5450700	Do you think it's...
5451420	5453100	I think it's here to stay for long enough
5453100	5454300	to make money off of it.
5454300	5454780	I don't know.
5454780	5455580	It's pretty hard to sell.
5455580	5456700	Do you think the boat you missed
5456700	5459340	is like buying a big chunk on the ground floor
5459340	5463500	that would make you like wealthy five years from now,
5463500	5464300	10 years from now?
5464300	5466220	I think one of your writers did something like that.
5467180	5468540	Matt Roller.
5468540	5470620	He bought Bitcoin early?
5470620	5471340	I think so, yeah.
5471340	5472860	I think he got on the ground floor.
5472860	5474460	A lot of people bought it, but you can't...
5474460	5475740	It's hard to sell.
5475740	5476700	That's the game.
5476700	5479180	Yeah, but you buy it and you hang on.
5479180	5482540	Yeah, I mean, the game is Bitcoin only becomes valuable
5482540	5484940	if everybody just decides to start using it
5484940	5486220	and you can't do that overnight.
5486220	5489100	So it's like, yeah, you're guessing
5489100	5491980	that it's the cryptocurrency that would prevail.
5491980	5494140	There's a lot of big ifs there.
5494140	5495820	It's with still a lot of challenges.
5496060	5497420	That's one encouraging thing.
5497420	5498060	Unethical.
5499020	5500300	Because it keeps...
5500300	5502460	Poor people don't really have access to Bitcoin.
5502460	5502860	What?
5502860	5504300	I had a guy on my podcast.
5504300	5505180	What about Lamar Austin Wilson?
5505180	5505340	Yeah.
5506540	5508220	I had a guy on my podcast.
5508220	5509580	I don't see him that way,
5509580	5511820	but I think I heard he was black and he...
5511820	5513020	I told him it was black.
5513020	5513660	He didn't see it.
5515500	5516460	He said the same thing.
5516460	5518380	He said cryptocurrency is inherently...
5518380	5520380	It's just like, wait, are we supposed to be restart?
5520380	5523180	We're just gonna restart this inequality thing
5523180	5524300	because black people aren't thinking
5524300	5525740	about fucking Bitcoin.
5525740	5529020	Like, this is a chance to change something.
5529020	5529980	And I can't remember.
5529980	5530620	I don't have...
5530620	5531340	And so he had an app.
5531340	5531980	And then I turned him out
5531980	5533260	because I'm like, this isn't for me.
5533260	5533980	It was an app.
5534940	5536060	And anyone can use it.
5537340	5538620	Got you on the ground floor.
5538620	5541740	Well, I like to be special in the things I use.
5541740	5542620	It's a cute concept.
5542620	5544380	There's a lot of histories of bubbles.
5544380	5545500	Tulip bubbles.
5545500	5546060	Oh, yeah.
5546060	5547180	Well, it's certainly a bubble.
5547180	5548460	It did a digital currency like 30 years ago.
5548460	5550060	The fuck's a tulip bubble?
5550060	5552380	The first bubble ever was the price of tulips.
5553340	5553900	Oh, whoa.
5555100	5556860	People got really into tulips and Holland.
5556860	5559180	And tulips threatened to become a currency?
5559180	5559660	Yeah.
5559660	5560620	Well, it was a currency
5560620	5562220	because it was worth so much.
5562220	5563020	But it was crazy
5563020	5564620	because it was inflation.
5564620	5567500	Just overnight, people were paying tons of money
5567500	5568220	for tulip bulbs.
5568220	5568860	So what happened?
5568860	5569900	And it was seasonal.
5569900	5571820	Somebody decided one day, literally,
5571820	5573580	somebody was like, tulip bulbs ain't shit.
5575340	5577020	Excuse me, I have something to say.
5578060	5579100	These ain't shit.
5579660	5581580	Someone finally just listened.
5581580	5582700	So then the bubble burst
5582700	5584620	and people's tulips weren't worth anything anymore.
5584620	5585660	And then they died, right?
5585660	5588220	Like, that's the other problem with flowers as money.
5588220	5589900	Well, I think the bulbs last a while.
5589900	5590380	Yeah.
5590380	5591420	Oh, these are the bulbs.
5591420	5593260	Well, I revealed my lack of flower knowledge.
5593260	5594460	No, I thought the same thing
5594460	5595580	until they were talking bulbs.
5595580	5597420	Is that Boom Chicago City?
5597420	5600060	But cryptocurrencies are superior
5600060	5602540	to all existing currencies
5602540	5604780	in that they actually are,
5604780	5607420	even though we look at them as based on nothing,
5607420	5608860	they're more based on something
5608860	5610380	than our current currencies, right?
5610380	5611340	And you can vape them.
5611420	5613420	Your current currency has actual,
5614060	5615820	you can trace it to an actual source,
5615820	5617420	like a Federal Reserve Bank,
5617420	5619900	which then would go straight to either gold or silver.
5619900	5622620	They say that they're no longer on the gold or silver.
5622620	5623500	But the truth of the matter is,
5623500	5625740	you can still take a dollar and buy gold and silver.
5626380	5627500	And you can do that legally.
5627500	5630460	But you could buy, do you mean take a dollar
5630460	5631900	and buy gold and silver?
5631900	5633980	Like, you can buy a Pokemon, you can buy a...
5633980	5636620	I mean, so that doesn't count
5636620	5639500	as the dollar being backed by something.
5639500	5639820	It does.
5639820	5641260	You're just saying that the dollar is backed
5641260	5642380	by the fact that everyone's using it.
5642380	5644940	Yeah, the dollar is backed by faith.
5644940	5647340	But ultimately, the end result is gold.
5647340	5649420	All financial leads to gold.
5649980	5651180	If that is the case,
5651180	5652620	then that means that Bitcoin,
5652620	5655820	from the limited understanding I can accomplish of it,
5655820	5659260	I think Bitcoin is mathematically guaranteed scarcity,
5659260	5661980	so that you can actually control...
5663660	5665100	Well, it's built on algorithms
5665100	5669100	that are meant to hopefully control for its expansion.
5669100	5672380	Right. Nobody can find out
5672380	5674060	by digging into the center of the earth
5674060	5676540	that the core of the earth is made of Bitcoin
5676540	5678300	and the market collapses.
5678300	5679180	Right. Well, the thing is,
5679180	5682940	you can steal Bitcoins kind of untraceably with some ease.
5682940	5684300	So that's something that it has
5684300	5686060	is like a disadvantage over money.
5686060	5688140	I mean, it's easy to steal money, don't get me wrong,
5688140	5692140	but it's easier to get away with stealing money for Bitcoins.
5692140	5693180	It's puked up in my throat.
5694220	5695260	Let's get them another cup.
5695260	5695900	Keep it.
5695900	5698300	It's chocolate chip cookie puke. It's delicious.
5698300	5701180	Oh, yeah. It's the acidic, sugary...
5701180	5702060	That's probably what it is.
5702060	5705660	It's the chocolate acid reflux or something.
5705660	5706620	Merry Christmas, kids.
5706620	5707980	I've definitely got to explore.
5709500	5711260	Here's some advice from Santa.
5712700	5713820	Your chimney has a flu.
5714780	5715500	Keep it closed.
5717980	5719340	Get high. Don't drink so much.
5719340	5722140	You're going to erode your fucking esophageal flap.
5722140	5724780	It's just, I can't eat popcorn while I'm talking
5724780	5726060	or I'll choke to death.
5726060	5727980	And, yeah.
5727980	5728540	Orange juice.
5729500	5733420	Everything that I put into my body is at war with it
5734140	5734780	in some form.
5736540	5741180	It's either the new kid in prison and the whole body is going like,
5741180	5742220	woo-hoo, who's this?
5742780	5747180	Or it's like something that's trying to break into my body.
5747180	5748940	Steve's bringing you some water.
5748940	5749420	Thanks.
5749420	5750700	God bless.
5750700	5752860	Thanks, Southy Elf.
5754300	5755500	Get out of here, Southy Elf.
5755500	5757660	Thanks to Wicked Retarded.
5759260	5760780	What are you doing over there, Southy Elf?
5761740	5763100	How's your mother, Southy Elf?
5763900	5764700	I got eyes on you.
5765740	5767260	I don't have any elf references.
5767260	5767660	There's no...
5768220	5768700	Gross.
5770700	5772060	All right, let's do we have another disgusting...
5772060	5774140	Do we have time for one more ham question?
5774140	5774860	Should we go ham?
5774860	5776220	If you find it fun.
5776220	5779580	I have a politics multiple choice question if you'd like one of those.
5780300	5783260	How many times has Ted Cruz made his wife come?
5783260	5783820	Okay.
5783900	5786220	Is the answer A, yeah, right.
5787660	5790700	B, trick question, she works for Goldman Sachs.
5790700	5794940	The only way that she can come is by signing a predatory loan to a person of color.
5795660	5798940	Or is the answer C, on the third hottest night of the year,
5798940	5801740	they kneel before the statue of ancient undersea god,
5801740	5805980	croplocked, and their eyes become hollow as they turn into bleak darkness,
5805980	5808700	which technically is an orgasm if you went to Yale.
5808700	5810620	I have to recuse myself from this question.
5811660	5813420	And he can't tell us why.
5813420	5814780	But it's because of one of those answers.
5814780	5815340	The NDAs.
5821580	5824060	I support everyone's religion, so I...
5824780	5825580	I'm gonna go A.
5826860	5827500	A is correct.
5827500	5828460	Yeah, thank you.
5828460	5829260	Oh, shit.
5830780	5832220	Stump us with a ham question.
5832220	5833980	Oh, no, this one you might get.
5834620	5838300	Which term describes the rate at which electrical energy is used?
5838300	5841660	Which term describes the rate at which electrical energy is used?
5841660	5842220	I gotta have this one.
5842220	5843740	A, voltage.
5843740	5845100	B, current.
5845100	5846300	C, resistance.
5846300	5847340	Or D, power.
5848540	5854460	The rate at which it's used is the answer currently one of the choices.
5855740	5859100	Oh, the rate at which it's used.
5859100	5862300	Yeah, and then it says resistance, voltage.
5862300	5865180	Voltage, current, resistance, or power.
5866300	5870060	All right, well, it's not resistance, it's not...
5870060	5871420	Oh, you know what's not current.
5871740	5873580	It's not current, it's voltage, right?
5873580	5874780	I'm gonna say voltage too.
5874780	5876140	I think voltage is like the...
5876140	5876620	No, no, no.
5876620	5877980	Voltage sounds like a rate.
5877980	5880860	Well, current is amperage, isn't that the...
5882460	5886700	That would be like the level that it's at across the system if it's...
5887500	5889660	So the rate at which it's used...
5889660	5891580	Okay, all right, I'm going voltage as well.
5891580	5892780	Voltage because it's a measurement.
5894140	5894700	An index.
5895340	5896220	Is that your guess?
5896220	5897820	No, my guess is the right answer.
5897820	5898780	Oh, shit.
5898780	5899740	It's power.
5899820	5902700	But didn't we lie well?
5903420	5906220	Yeah, we acted like really convincing ourselves effectively.
5906220	5908220	We did sound like we knew what we were talking about.
5908220	5910060	That's a good part of test-taking skills.
5910060	5916380	That when I was five, my dad had this bright idea to become a kid.
5916380	5919580	I need a train set and went out and bought a Tyco...
5920620	5922700	God, I forgot what scale, but it was a monstrous scale.
5922700	5923340	HO.
5923340	5924540	It wasn't HO, so it was one of...
5924540	5925580	It's not a Tyco man, barely.
5925580	5926220	Oh, Jesus Christ.
5926220	5926700	No Zs.
5927260	5927740	HO.
5927740	5928620	I'm gonna get into you.
5929340	5929820	And then...
5932300	5934220	So Christmas day comes, I open this thing.
5934860	5935420	Here it is.
5936300	5937820	I want him to help me set it up.
5938540	5940940	And he tells me, no.
5942380	5942860	We can't do it...
5942860	5944540	My father didn't help me set it up.
5944540	5949500	He said, we can't do it in this house because the voltage...
5951420	5954220	If we plug this into these walls, the paint will peel.
5955180	5958140	And so, unfortunately, son, this train can't...
5958140	5959260	He just didn't want to set it up.
5960700	5961980	Which is why at six, I set up...
5961980	5963340	The next train I got, I set up myself.
5963340	5964620	I just read the instructions and did it myself.
5964620	5969500	But he literally lied and said, the paint would peel if we tried it.
5969500	5969740	Jesus Christ.
5969740	5970860	That was your dad?
5970860	5971580	That was my dad.
5971580	5975020	So what do you love more now, him or trains?
5976060	5976860	Oh, come on, man.
5976860	5977980	That's a no-brainer, trains.
5979180	5981260	I just meant, well, sometimes we invert that stuff.
5981260	5982380	It's like, your dad got...
5982380	5985820	You're like, fuck a train and my dad's so amazing.
5986380	5988940	Because he taught me how to build my own train sets and...
5988940	5990300	Kids twist shit.
5990300	5993420	Kid across the street from me could not wait for his father to set up the track.
5994140	5998060	So he pulled the train out the box and broke it by playing with it on the carpet all day long.
5998780	5999660	Like a dumb ass.
6001020	6003820	My mom threw my 10th birthday cake at my father.
6005340	6006780	The kid across the street, same kid.
6006780	6008940	His mother would beat him with Hot Wheels tracks,
6008940	6011580	which is the darkest shit in the world to be the kid.
6011580	6014700	With the plastic loopy loop ones.
6014700	6015020	Final.
6016700	6020380	If you put the connector in it, then it was like a nice stinky tail at the end of it to pop him.
6020380	6021420	It's the worst thing you've ever seen.
6021980	6024060	Remember that Joan Benne Ramsey thing,
6024060	6033020	where she had the two contact wounds on her body and they deduced that it was...
6034700	6039820	Her brother must have poked her already dead body with a railroad track,
6040380	6041980	piece of railroad track from the other room.
6041980	6045420	What we're saying is don't get your kids trains for Christmas.
6045420	6048780	It could either end in disappointment or death, and that's it for trains.
6048780	6049500	That was then.
6049500	6049900	Tyco...
6051260	6053500	I'm here on behalf of the fine folks of Tyco.
6053500	6054300	Lionel, actually.
6054300	6057580	Lionel ran into trouble, financial trouble, and almost failed,
6058140	6063580	but were saved by Neil Young, who bought the entire company and resurrected it.
6064700	6066460	So I think Lionel's a fine company right now.
6066460	6067580	Wow, Christmas fun facts.
6068460	6069340	Neil Young?
6069340	6070860	Neil Young bought it because...
6070860	6071340	His son.
6071420	6073820	He and his son bonded through two things.
6073820	6077980	One was the speech synthesizer that he had that was a Kurzweil, I think,
6078540	6080780	and then also through trains.
6080780	6084460	And so now he's got on his camp, he's got this thing where kids come
6084460	6088620	and they ride the big scale, the L scale or something like that, Lionel train,
6088620	6091100	and they just ride him around and they help maintain him.
6091100	6098940	And then they also look at the big smaller HO scale displays that he has and he helps.
6098940	6100780	Which brings things back to Alabama.
6101580	6102140	Sweet home.
6103020	6108860	I heard Leonard Skynyrd is buying their own model train that's called Fuck You, Neil Young.
6108860	6109500	Oh, fuck.
6109500	6110140	Tricycle.
6112700	6113340	Oh, God.
6113340	6118460	It's a deep cut little war between those guys about Alabama.
6118460	6120460	Only about the state of Alabama, though.
6120460	6122140	Not about the politics involved.
6122140	6122780	Well, no, there was...
6122780	6124220	Skynyrd was progressive.
6124220	6125580	No, but Skynyrd was...
6125580	6131260	Their lyrics, there's contention about that because if you listen to those Skynyrd lyrics,
6131260	6137340	they're referring to some racist shit, some hot button shit and...
6137340	6139100	They're just saying, hey, man, you don't understand this.
6139100	6139980	We're from the South.
6139980	6140620	You don't get it.
6140620	6141340	So shut up.
6141340	6144300	Yeah, but when you say that about a state...
6144300	6145420	I know, I was getting.
6145420	6146300	I was going.
6146300	6146380	All right.
6146380	6147020	I was going.
6147020	6147740	Well, you're very dry.
6147740	6148460	They bring up walls, right?
6148460	6149740	I was being super dry.
6150700	6152300	You and Chris McKenna, I can never...
6152300	6153660	I was being super dry.
6153660	6156060	You guys do jokes and then I'm like, well, no, but the thing is...
6156060	6157020	Dan, I'm fucking with you.
6157020	6157420	All right.
6157420	6161020	All right.
6161020	6161660	What time is it?
6161660	6162620	9 43.
6162620	6164300	McKenna said he named...
6164300	6165100	Can we say that?
6166300	6167420	I think you can.
6167420	6171660	Kenna said he named The Rock's character in Jumanji 2 after me.
6172620	6173340	What?
6173340	6175420	Dr. Spencer Smulders.
6175420	6176300	That's awesome.
6176300	6176860	That's rad.
6176860	6177100	Yeah.
6178140	6180140	And you don't know if he's kidding because...
6180140	6182620	No, I think he's honest because he's told me multiple times,
6182620	6184700	each time, assuming I forgot.
6184780	6188620	You'd forget something like naming a Jumanji character after you.
6189340	6191100	Can you guys read that clock from here?
6191820	6192300	Yeah.
6192300	6193820	16 44.
6193820	6194860	Oh, it says 16.
6194860	6196060	Fiore und Fiorte.
6196940	6198060	It's inaccurate.
6198060	6199340	That's a blue blur to me.
6199900	6202380	You guys have contacts or glasses?
6202380	6203500	I'm visibly wearing glasses.
6203500	6204460	I have wall fissions.
6204460	6206300	My eyes are going bad fast.
6206300	6207820	You should get hit in the eye with a laser.
6207820	6208940	That's pretty crazy, man.
6209820	6212780	I'm going to...
6212780	6216380	This is actually the last time our listeners and viewers will
6217420	6219580	be in contact with me before I'm 45.
6221020	6222620	When exactly is the big day?
6222620	6225580	Which is exactly half of my life,
6225580	6227980	because I'm definitely the kind of guy that lives to 90.
6227980	6229820	Just after Christmas or something.
6229820	6230300	Any plans?
6230300	6231660	Just after New Year, so one of the two.
6231660	6233660	I retire at 47.
6234620	6234860	I...
6235740	6236860	Like a boss.
6236860	6237180	Man.
6237980	6239820	I mean, once your eyes are just...
6239820	6241580	They can't even see clocks.
6241580	6243100	You should just eat a bullet.
6243100	6244380	No, you got glasses.
6244380	6245500	You're going to love glasses.
6245500	6246380	I have glasses.
6246380	6246940	They're dumb.
6249020	6250700	I'm just saying God has a plan.
6252220	6253740	It's like, here's your eyes and you're like,
6253740	6254860	okay, how long do these last?
6255580	6257580	45 years is the answer.
6258940	6261020	Oh, well, what can't you see?
6261020	6262860	Well, when the answer is like,
6262860	6266140	how many fingers is your fellow caveman holding up from 50 yards?
6266140	6266860	Big deal.
6267020	6268780	What's your caveman got that's so important
6268780	6270300	that you need to count on his fingers?
6270300	6272220	But when the answer is a clock, what time is it?
6273740	6274780	What's your flight number?
6274780	6275660	You know, at the airport?
6275660	6277020	It's like, you know, you're like...
6277020	6277740	I don't know.
6277740	6279660	I got to pull out these fucking telescopes
6279660	6281100	and put them on my face.
6281100	6282620	Just let this tiger eat you.
6284540	6285260	Is it that though,
6285260	6287420	or is it the magnifications that we have to deal with
6287420	6290380	where you're like one minute looking at your phone like this?
6290380	6291820	Maybe we're fucking up our eyes, Marr?
6291820	6292940	And then you're looking at the screen and then you're there.
6292940	6294460	I think that's a huge retinal.
6294460	6296540	That's the kind of like contract spin like that.
6296540	6298860	It would be crazy if we hadn't had a huge...
6298860	6301420	Yeah, if technology of screen culture didn't...
6301420	6304060	It wasn't fucking with her eye muscles.
6304060	6306380	Our screens are too bright is the newest one
6306380	6308060	that we should all have our laptops.
6308780	6311020	That sounds like the whitest fucking bullshit.
6311020	6313340	Like, my screen's too bright.
6313340	6315260	Give me a new screen, Janice.
6315260	6316140	It's too bright.
6317100	6318380	But Brandon brought it up.
6319500	6320860	I do know Janice though.
6320860	6323020	But it just sounds like...
6323020	6324220	He did nail that part.
6324940	6328300	Like, even if the screens are too bright,
6328300	6329820	who can make that their main...
6329820	6331180	Because there's got to be a person who's like,
6331900	6333660	I'm going to be the screen brightness person.
6333660	6336060	Have you ever thought about telling your kids about the future?
6336700	6339340	I mean, you could tell your kids don't have your screen so bright.
6339340	6342220	I want to know, since you do a Christmas and a birthday,
6342860	6343900	back to back, right?
6343900	6344460	Me, yeah.
6344460	6344940	Yeah.
6345580	6346060	Plans?
6347180	6347820	No, I don't.
6347820	6349500	Well, I don't have any plans this year.
6349500	6351980	Usually for Christmas and or for New Year's,
6352860	6354620	usually I've been, the last couple of years,
6354620	6357820	been organizing something where maybe we all go to New York
6357820	6359580	for New Year's or something like that.
6359580	6360940	I haven't made any plans this year.
6360940	6362940	I'm not going out of town for Christmas.
6362940	6366300	And in general, no birthday plans ever
6366300	6369500	because I grew up with the hangover birthday.
6371260	6372620	That's one thing I'm actually...
6375420	6377900	I like about being a baby New Year.
6378060	6382300	I don't have a birthday specialness.
6382300	6382780	Yeah.
6382780	6383980	And it's nice.
6383980	6385100	It makes me feel superior.
6385100	6386140	It makes me feel like Wolverine.
6387980	6388540	People are like,
6389180	6390460	what do you want to do for your birthday?
6390460	6391980	And I'm like, I don't want to do anything.
6391980	6392940	And they're like, come on.
6392940	6393900	Or you want to do something?
6393900	6395260	I'm like, no, I really don't.
6395260	6397580	I'm totally socialized from birth
6397580	6399820	to not give a fuck about my birthday.
6399820	6400780	You should do something.
6402220	6404140	You know what I like to do for my birthday?
6404140	6405100	Take down the tree.
6406060	6408060	Like, that's all I associate with my birthday.
6408860	6410860	I would get an extra present, you know,
6410860	6412700	somewhere, you know, like from my mommy.
6412700	6414300	And like, that's not right.
6414300	6415660	It just feels like...
6415660	6417420	No, but it is right.
6417420	6418620	It is right to mortgage.
6418620	6419500	It's your birthday, man.
6419500	6420460	It's right for you to say it.
6420460	6421180	You do whatever you want.
6421180	6423740	Your friend's job is to say that that's not right.
6423740	6424540	I would have been...
6424540	6425180	I used to be like that.
6425180	6426380	I used to be shut down.
6426380	6426620	And...
6426620	6427580	Wait, when's your birthday?
6428620	6429020	9-11.
6429020	6429740	April 25th.
6429740	6430780	Oh, but you're just saying like,
6430780	6432620	in general, emotionally, you're shut down.
6432620	6433900	But you're talking about after Easter.
6433900	6434940	Being to mortgage is like,
6434940	6436620	having a birthday after Christmas.
6437740	6438060	Wait.
6438060	6438940	Oh, the look.
6440540	6442620	I just don't get to say Rochester.
6443980	6445180	I just feel like people...
6447020	6447980	I used to be like,
6447980	6449980	no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
6449980	6451420	I'm not going to do anything.
6451420	6453100	Not that that's you, but...
6453100	6453660	It is.
6453660	6456220	My friends would be the ones
6456220	6456940	that would kind of be like,
6456940	6457820	look, dum-dum.
6460380	6461020	Have a surprise.
6461020	6462220	Like, in small,
6462940	6463580	things happen.
6463580	6465900	Like, one day we went to Papa Gino's
6467100	6467740	at the start of it.
6467740	6469420	But you're going to say Papa John's.
6469420	6470620	Yeah, but I don't want that.
6470620	6472300	Well, look, let's split the difference.
6472300	6474220	Here's what I usually do.
6474220	6476780	I'll say maybe I'll go,
6478220	6481260	I'm turning 45, meet me at the roost.
6481260	6482460	I'll be there from 8 o'clock to...
6482460	6483500	That's a really great...
6483500	6484700	The roost is great.
6484700	6485740	And you buy out the...
6485740	6486700	Like, you just do like,
6486700	6488780	get a jukebox buyout.
6488780	6489980	Look, only songs.
6489980	6490220	Yeah.
6491020	6491740	I'll do something like that.
6492700	6493420	But a lot of times,
6493420	6494540	it's like everybody's hung over,
6494540	6495180	including me.
6495180	6496940	Like, it's like January 3rd, you know?
6497900	6499340	It's like a crazy time to...
6499340	6500700	I remember the one,
6500700	6503820	one of the best times I had post-Christmas
6503820	6506540	was when you and Merle had a joint birthday party.
6506540	6507820	It was at the Griffin, which I hate.
6507820	6508220	But like,
6510220	6511580	just that community of people
6511580	6512620	sitting around, standing around,
6512620	6514060	talking and being able to bounce
6514060	6515340	from one conversation to the next,
6515340	6516700	it was such a good group of people.
6516700	6517740	It was fantastic.
6517740	6518940	It was a lovely, lovely, lovely...
6518940	6520780	I'm going to throw Palm Springs,
6520780	6521580	Rent a House out.
6522220	6522940	Because that way,
6522940	6523420	Palm Springs, Rent a House.
6523420	6524780	You're there for New Year's Eve,
6525420	6526460	and then you just stay.
6527900	6530060	Asking a lot of people to drive...
6530060	6531740	But you're there for...
6531740	6534700	That means go there for New Year's and stay.
6534700	6536140	Maybe an elite group.
6536140	6537660	And then they can come and go.
6537660	6538140	Right.
6538140	6539260	Because you'll be there for a while.
6540060	6541180	You know, do it for five days.
6541980	6543580	Well, guys...
6544140	6545260	Celebrate yourself, man.
6545260	6546460	Celebrate yourself.
6546460	6547580	Celebrate yourself.
6547580	6549020	Celebrate yourself.
6549020	6550140	What's the thing that you would
6550140	6552860	most want your friends to do with you
6552860	6554860	if you had unlimited resources?
6555660	6557420	Show us how to celebrate.
6557420	6558380	That's a great question.
6559660	6562060	I'd like to watch Xanadu.
6563020	6563580	Perfect.
6563580	6564140	Perfect.
6564140	6564620	Love it.
6564620	6565580	I did that last time.
6566540	6568060	When I force people to watch things,
6568060	6569580	it gets very sad.
6569580	6571580	Trude off the red-nosed reindeer.
6571580	6574300	Okay, I have to watch Hudson Hawk.
6574300	6574700	I get it.
6574700	6576060	I have to watch it because it's your birthday.
6576060	6577180	And then they're kind of like...
6577500	6579580	Hudson Hawk made a leave.
6579580	6580700	But yeah, what is on your...
6582300	6584300	What's on your list of things that would be...
6584300	6585820	What's the thing that brings you joy
6585820	6588060	that you would love to share that joy with your friends?
6588700	6589580	Don't say AIDS.
6592300	6594700	Unless it's his birthday wish.
6594700	6595660	This was age-y tone.
6597900	6599740	You know, like Minecraft.
6599740	6600460	But then it's like...
6602060	6604300	I don't want to come home and have you guys go,
6604300	6606300	surprise, and there's like inflatable blocks
6606300	6608460	that I can pick with a balloon axe.
6608460	6609260	Wouldn't you love that?
6609260	6610860	Man, I'm the one you bought.
6610860	6612940	Trust me when I say I'm the one you bought the gun for.
6615820	6617340	If you come home, I'm in your house.
6617340	6619100	I'm gonna be standing there with the two raccoons
6619100	6620860	like this motherfucker right here.
6621420	6622300	Dad, don't shoot me.
6622300	6623020	Don't shoot me.
6623020	6624140	Dad, got you, motherfucker.
6624140	6625100	You should have shot me.
6629900	6632380	You can come in my house anytime you want.
6632380	6635580	I promise, as long as you dress the same,
6635580	6636940	I won't be like, what the fuck?
6638700	6639980	Just wear the antlers.
6639980	6640860	Fine, Minecraft.
6641420	6645180	No, but I don't want to have a Minecraft-themed birthday party.
6645180	6646460	It's like a six-year-old.
6646460	6649020	That's like, nah, I enjoy playing Minecraft
6649020	6651980	because I don't want to be around people
6651980	6654140	and I want to have a sense of order in my life.
6654140	6656140	What if we get a this is your life sort of thing?
6657820	6659580	For my 30th birthday, we did a roast.
6660300	6662940	It was real and I was just recalling that the other day
6662940	6664780	with Jeff and it was really funny
6664780	6668380	because it was like literally like the dais for the roast
6668380	6671980	was more twice as much as the people in the audience.
6672540	6674460	The point wasn't to do it as a performance.
6675580	6677980	We just wanted to do a roast kind of thing
6677980	6679660	and we just all kind of roasted each other
6679660	6680940	in the back room of this restaurant
6680940	6684220	and it was just us at a long table laughing
6684220	6686460	as if there was an audience there and there really wasn't.
6686460	6687260	That was pretty fun.
6688140	6692380	And it was also mean but whatever.
6692380	6694700	We called each other drunk and old and gay and whatever.
6695980	6699740	But yeah, so what did you say that reminded me of that?
6699740	6701580	Like you said.
6701580	6702540	This is your life.
6702540	6703100	All right, right.
6703100	6706540	Like a performance, like your special attention thing.
6706540	6709420	Erin McGathey did like the probably the coolest birthday
6710060	6712780	thing where because she and it was just like
6713340	6714460	you can't really top that.
6714460	6715500	She took all of it.
6715500	6718700	She published a book and then had a book
6719260	6723420	like reading with all of my friends
6723420	6728220	and like Yvette Nicole Brown reading passages from my book
6728220	6731020	and then like other everyone that I'd worked with
6731020	6733980	like coming up and reading like that was pretty
6733980	6736380	that was like a narcissistic Philly cheesesteak.
6736380	6738940	It was just like I was sick of myself.
6739500	6741500	Two hours later and it was like amazing feeling
6741500	6743660	like I didn't know I could get that full of myself
6743740	6745580	and like burp and fall asleep.
6746860	6748700	I was there that that was pretty special.
6748700	6750140	And as such I kind of don't need that.
6750140	6753260	I don't really I don't really fantasize about that anymore.
6753260	6756860	Like yeah, I think so it's like it's sort of like I want.
6757580	6758940	What do I really want?
6758940	6760540	What do I like a fantasy be?
6760540	6764060	Even if that's to be left completely alone on your birthday
6764620	6767180	because that also a way to celebrate it.
6767180	6768380	Rocket choose.
6769180	6770140	Rocket choose now.
6770620	6772700	Yeah, I mean I just I just go up in the air
6772700	6773740	and then I'd want to come down.
6775900	6778060	I mean I'd like I'd like to it would be great
6778060	6779340	to have a big party at my house.
6779340	6783180	But like it my house but then it's your house.
6783180	6784620	It's just all this shit.
6784620	6786780	There's holes in the stairs where the doggy
6786780	6789100	and all the shit and it's a doggy the curtains.
6789100	6792060	And so it's like yeah I would I would love to have
6792060	6794780	my house be functional and have people come over
6794780	6796300	and have the whole house filled with people
6796300	6799100	and I'd love to walk around and say could I get you another drink
6799180	6803340	and and and and have like a proper party at my house.
6804140	6805500	But it's yeah.
6805500	6807660	Adults only do one of those things like a dinner party.
6807660	6809660	No I'd like there to be some some some kids.
6809660	6811820	That's what I'm joking I'm joking.
6811820	6814540	I'm not yeah I am too I'm not a pedophile.
6814540	6816620	Although I would I did want to talk about that for a while
6816620	6817340	but it's too late.
6817340	6817820	We got time.
6818380	6820540	We got we got the blur.
6820540	6823100	The blur says here's the thing Roy Moore is not a pedophile.
6823100	6825260	He's a he's attracted to pubescent girls.
6825260	6827660	That makes him a worse person because it means he has
6827660	6830620	he's putting his own lack of impulse control above the law.
6832700	6834780	I know we don't like pedophiles because they have
6834780	6837500	uncontrollable compulsions usually brought on by child abuse
6838140	6841340	that the victims are the most innocent people in the world.
6841340	6844060	And so the crimes are the worst that you could imagine.
6844060	6846700	But when you we keep calling this guy a pedophile
6846700	6850860	but I just I just every time I want to go like he's not really a pedophile.
6850860	6852860	He's worse he's worse than a pedophile.
6852860	6856540	He's he's a guy that what that that is like oh she's 14.
6856540	6859820	I'd hit that she's she can't defend herself.
6859820	6861900	She her life is going to be ruined.
6861900	6863340	I'm making that decision.
6863340	6867500	I could I could we all have to take shits and we do it in a toilet.
6867500	6869980	Like we have laws that say well they got to be 18
6869980	6872220	because then at least they have a little bit of a chance
6872220	6873900	to not be permanently scarred.
6873900	6876780	If you drive by them on the street and go like why not.
6877420	6879500	And he was like a guy that was like a district attorney
6879500	6881580	and was going like why not I could get away with it.
6881580	6882380	I could get away with it.
6882380	6885740	It's like that's a in a crazy alternate universe
6885740	6889100	where we found out that a politician was a pedophile.
6889100	6892860	It might be an opportunity to be like okay you probably shouldn't run for office
6893500	6896540	but let's help you like like thank you for that legislation
6896540	6898780	that you did that's so great before we found out you were a pedophile.
6898780	6901020	Now now you thank you for raising pedophile awareness.
6901020	6903420	Go in this place in this treatment program for pedophiles.
6903420	6905980	This is a guy who's like a sociopath you know it's like a criminal.
6905980	6909100	It's a person that was just like like an arch criminal.
6909100	6910700	There's an important distinction there.
6910700	6915660	Anyways it's just it's hard to go to you always you want to like you want to go like well
6915660	6919740	technically he's not you then you like end up in this conversation where they're like oh
6919740	6923100	go on tell us about how pedophiles are really important
6923900	6927180	like a really important demographic that need to be given a shout out.
6928700	6931260	There's not a lot of products exclusively for them.
6931260	6933900	Did you see it did you see that documentary pervert park?
6934700	6935500	No.
6935500	6937740	Everyone should watch that because I know it's like
6937740	6938940	watch it on Christmas with your family.
6938940	6943900	Pedophilia is obviously and understandably our culture's bedrock.
6943900	6950540	It's you can't you can't get worse than that but it's a condition
6951260	6956220	and then when you watch this documentary pervert park you it'll make you understand
6956220	6960380	not in a preachy way but by testimony of all these people that live in this trailer park
6960380	6964300	of all these sex offenders that they can't live anywhere else and it's run by a sex offender and
6965180	6970060	it's like every single one of their stories they're not they're not heroes they're not
6971740	6975180	but every single one of their stories involves getting abused.
6975180	6975500	Yes.
6975500	6982540	And so it's like here we are in this society where we go oh it's like oh you got abused so you're
6982540	6988140	probably going to abuse somebody or you abuse somebody you probably got abused and we that's
6988140	6993420	definitely a capitalism thing like we don't put money no you can't get votes by saying
6994060	7000940	let alone campaign money by saying I would like to pump some financing into this pedophile cycle.
7002060	7007740	This person molested this child which means there's an opportunity to break a cycle here
7007740	7012780	either with their child or with them like if you if you elect me your congressman I'll make sure
7012780	7017660	that money goes to the right place like and as a result that's what you know like so then you have
7017740	7021820	this that's what brought down John Kerry's campaign.
7023260	7028940	Yeah he did it it does not work it is not good in the debates that and running the other way
7028940	7033260	when he saw those Vietnamese bullets well you know why that swift boat remember he was like turn
7033260	7040940	the swift boat around and it's like yes but the you bring up a great point about that that Roy
7040940	7046620	Moore is because I think the thing is is by calling Roy Moore a pedophile you're giving him
7046620	7052300	stolen victim valor right where like he didn't earn any like he doesn't have a medical excuse
7052300	7057580	to be a bad person he's just a bully and an asshole your neighbor might be a pedophile
7057580	7063820	and he's not running for d he wasn't da and he wasn't uh he's not running for anything unless
7063820	7069900	you live right next to Roy Moore in which case don't listen to this part anyways it's all over
7069900	7075980	now but yeah pedophile was the easy word to use but it just didn't really apply and it's like weird
7075980	7080540	because it's like isn't there like a little bit of residue there where you go ha found out that guy
7080540	7085020	was a pedophile cost on the election you know and now it's like there's almost like a sort of
7085020	7091820	residual like badness there where it's like oh if you can find evil in someone you call it out
7091820	7096220	but it's like what about what about selfishness sorry what were you gonna say to merge just
7096220	7101420	idiocy also as well and it's just sort of like giving all that and everything
7102140	7105660	and jackass rides up on a horse
7107420	7111740	i mean so you get to the point where it's sort of like i mean yes what you're saying is true
7111740	7118700	but also the vitriol doesn't need to go away it has to just be reshaped and directed and i guess
7118700	7123900	in the right shape at him again because it's that would be like somebody calling somebody an asshole
7123900	7128380	and then somebody coming out of the crowd and going technically not a sphincter and it's like
7128460	7136540	you know what i'm saying this dickhead in all of his whatever either either made that directive
7136540	7140060	or heard that directive and thought no this is a good idea i'm gonna ride up on a horse
7140060	7146220	for all of this and confidently slam the numbers aren't good or the numbers are good right up on a
7146220	7150940	horse or the numbers aren't good i'm gonna why don't you ride up on a horse and tilt it he just
7150940	7155260	wanted to show 14 year old girls in alabama that they have stuff in common like they all like horses
7155340	7160140	like that's what the horse thing my little pony says i should vote this way if you run a simulator
7160140	7164700	in your head where you cross threshold after threshold after threshold like the people that
7164700	7169900	we're up against in this culture war um if you imagine being one of them
7171660	7179260	whereas you and i can be eroded we have that option we can drift into cynicism we can start
7179260	7184860	caring less and less we can realize we never cared at all i'm not trying to say like we're
7184860	7191180	i'm han solo and we're in something i'm saying like we have the position that we're in allows
7191180	7200620	for slow transformation from what we are to what they are they have the luxury air quotes for our
7200620	7209500	listeners um of being on the side of a threshold where it's it's over man lay on mcduff like like
7209500	7216380	like like the you you cannot now change your mind and it's weirder than in nixon's time because now
7216380	7221340	there's an internet everyone has a facebook timeline everyone it used to be the joke about
7221340	7225980	the your mondale bumper sticker that was like you know you had to scrape your bumper to like erase
7225980	7231100	your paper trail in nixon's time it took six years for your uncle tony to realize nixon was
7231100	7235740	a piece of shit and he could spend three years three thanksgivings he could just shut his mouth
7235740	7240540	during the pop the the conversation slowly get to you know what i don't like that guy he's tricky
7240540	7247660	dick we have now this like up to the minute like you have to double down or release every day
7247660	7254220	and if you have been doubling down for a year you are 23 percent of the nation right depending on
7254220	7258940	what polls you go by and how you compound these information we've gotten to this core
7258940	7265820	as you have this fucking thing where you now need to go to that rally and you need to ride up on a
7265820	7270780	horse and you need to to give speeches about uh you know we were in vietnam and there were
7270780	7275820	shit we could have fucked a million 11 year olds and we didn't do that and like and our lawyers
7275820	7280620	are jew our accountants are jew and everyone's like waving their hats in the air there's a subtext
7280620	7288140	to it which is like we're too far gone stop us save us we cannot stop ourselves you won't stop
7288140	7294140	shaming us if we do we cannot we have we have adopted a philosophy that says we're tired of
7294140	7299180	being ashamed so when every morning when they get up and they think about what if this is the day
7299180	7306460	when i changed my mind the the answer is oh and so i begin a lifetime of fucking having to think
7306460	7313020	about that year i spent like working for sauron and i'm just gonna like be the most awkward person
7313020	7318300	at the office party no i have to fucking double down that's why they all get mad at starbucks cups
7318300	7323740	and like these crazy you know like all of their rage gets like funneled at the weirdest things
7323740	7328860	like an espn reporter said that the president like farted or something and then they're like
7328860	7334700	oh we gotta get her off the tv like that's like their it's their lives are such a contradiction
7334700	7339980	that it's gonna it's gonna be incredible just to watch how they like their brains explode over
7339980	7343820	the next few or how the government buildings that they blow up explode i mean we are either way
7343820	7350300	something these people are going to continue to mass shoot and fertilize bomb and and and the best
7350300	7355980	we can hope for at this point my definition of utopia which is basically get me back to my white
7355980	7361900	fragile mollusk shell like i in that universe they're just back in their mom's basement like
7361900	7368220	polishing their jack boots and with uh with their swastika posters like covered with like dukes dukes
7368220	7372780	of hazard posters you know for in case company comes over like like like it's just back to the
7372780	7379180	shadows back to the shame and then what do they do down there like i don't know they fucking fester
7379180	7385820	and metastasize obviously like but i don't yeah i'm all over the fucking place you got it merry
7385820	7390700	christmas i guess that's my point yes merry christmas we gotta go but we won't see everybody
7390700	7395820	until 2018 yeah cannot wait to fucking see what we all do it would be nice to have a new year's
7395820	7400780	show where we could talk about the year but what have we ever done but talk about the year uh uh
7400780	7407820	yeah let's let's have epiphanies um and we will good stuff no there is there is so much that is
7407820	7412620	positive that it's 2018's right here uh there's just so much crap that happened early on
7413660	7417500	and we've been talking talking talking talking talking talking talking all year long about this
7417500	7422620	but it's it's it's right man even if even if shit doesn't hit the fan over christmas break
7422620	7428620	which i was alluding to uh shit not hitting the fan over christmas break is is in itself a form of
7428620	7435660	weird passive shit hitting a nascent fan um and so for sure 2018 is going to be a weird time to start
