0	22860	Hello gang, from the Dynasty Typewriters, the Hayworth, whatever the theater is called
22860	28100	down here, MacArthur Park, Los Angeles, Harmontown is now in session, episode 301.
28100	36580	Oh shit, is my voice back?
36580	38340	I just got loud for no reason.
38340	48980	Let's bring out the game master, ex-terodinaire, Spencer Crittenden, everybody.
48980	57340	He's all in brown and he's down to clown, what's in that little lunch box baby?
57340	58340	What is this?
58340	59340	Treasures.
59340	61340	You got secret treasures in there?
61340	62340	What?
62340	63340	You got secret treasures in there.
63340	66060	Yeah, I got secret treasures.
66060	67540	Can I know your secret?
67540	68540	No.
68540	70540	Well, we'll find out.
70540	71540	Fantastic.
71540	74260	I feel like I have to yell.
74260	76420	Well, let's not.
76420	77420	Let's stop.
77420	78420	How about this?
78420	81660	Let's stop yelling and we can bring out the mayor of Harmontown, who?
81660	82660	Dan Harmon.
82660	98500	Yo, I got a little baby backpack, I got a little baby backpack, I'm back in packing
98500	106420	where it's back at, a millennial backpack, a little tiny thing the size of a wallet hanging
106420	107420	on my back.
107420	108420	What are you calling?
108420	109420	A little baby, tiny backpack.
109420	110420	It proves I'm 19.
110420	120420	I only got so much shit, so why would I have a bigger backpack than it?
120420	127420	I just have room for my ecstasy on your phone.
127420	131980	I got a little tiny backpack.
131980	137020	It's a Rick and Morty little tiny backpack.
137020	144700	And I see in proper millennial style, you kept the tags on it to prove that it's, you
144700	145700	know.
145700	147700	Well, I wanted to keep it in kind of mint condition because I thought I'd give it away
147700	151260	to an audience member tonight.
151260	157180	Are you saying that somebody here at the dynasty type point is going to go home with a tiny
157180	159380	wallet-sized millennial backpack?
159380	167060	You thought all you were going to get...
167060	168060	There's an impressive...
168060	170900	It's a whole mosaic of all Rick and Morty scenes and things.
170900	175620	It was in my office on the pile of this merch every day comes in, I'm like, here's the tooth
175620	179260	brush, here's the watch, here's the thing, and there's this little tiny backpack.
179260	180980	I brought it home to Cody.
180980	185700	She said, I'm a little old for a little tiny backpack, why don't you take it to the show
185700	187700	and give it away to somebody?
187700	189060	So, I will.
189060	191300	And you have worn it, I saw it.
191300	193300	So, you can sell it?
193300	194300	Yeah, exactly.
194300	197300	You'll be able to say it was worn by...
197300	200300	Dan Harmon.
200300	207140	Okay, so what's going on?
207140	212140	I mentioned we were just talking, you said you like the Ant-Man and the Wasp.
212140	214380	Yeah, the new Ant-Man movie.
214380	216380	Haven't seen it.
216380	221540	Good for our friend Chris McKenna of community, the beating heart of community.
221540	224940	I think he's heavily involved in that Ant-Man business.
224940	226260	So it's good to hear that that's good.
226260	229940	I really like Deadpool 2, I think I mentioned that, I mentioned that again.
229940	231460	I thought Deadpool 2 was awesome.
231460	232460	Why'd you like it?
232460	233460	I don't know, just...
233460	234900	Well, I guess it was just...
234900	238940	Maybe it's a sad state of movies these days, but it's just when you're shocked that something
238940	242060	like lands, it was like...
242060	243740	That's why I like all the Marvel movies.
243740	247020	It's just like, I like superheroes and this is a movie.
247020	249020	Yeah, and it...
249020	250420	This didn't kick me in the face.
250420	251420	Yeah.
251420	255100	Yeah, I mean, overall, I won't be lying, I'm 45 years old, I think I'm allowed to say,
255100	258380	I don't really care about your Marvels anymore.
258380	259380	Sure.
259380	264500	Like, you're a spider, I get it.
264500	267740	You climb walls, you're still climbing them, there's been like nine actors playing you.
267740	271900	It's like, I know, I know you can climb walls, I don't care anymore.
271980	277380	I also don't know what I care about, I mean, don't go to me for what you should be watching,
277380	279580	my taste buds are dying, so is my soul.
279580	285460	I sit in bed and I'm living either the best life or the worst life, I listen to podcasts
285460	291860	about people being murdered and I play Minecraft, I'm just slowly rotting away with a big smile
291860	292860	on my face.
292860	299180	So, if I was 19, it'd probably be a great time to care about spider people.
300180	302900	What's he doing on that wall?
302900	306820	Walls are for stopping you from walking, he's walking up it, holy shit, what kind of guy
306820	307820	is he?
307820	308820	He's a spider guy.
308820	309820	Okay.
309820	312860	Like, if you're 19, you're probably like, Jesus Christ, this is my die-hard.
312860	313860	Yeah, man.
313860	314860	I don't know.
314860	317020	I don't know from kids, I don't know what you care about.
317020	319740	It should be called Spider Guy, not Spider Man.
319740	320740	He was young, he was a kid.
320740	323500	It should be called Spider Dude, or Spider...
323500	325500	Spider Dude is something.
326300	328300	Now, Spider-Child, I don't like.
328300	333220	Spider-Child, what's the movie with the little girl with the purple wig and she kicks everybody's
333220	334220	ass?
334220	335220	Spider-Child.
335220	336220	Huh?
336220	337220	Spider-Child.
337220	338220	Kick-ass?
338220	339220	Kick-ass, okay.
339220	340220	Yeah, yeah.
340220	341220	Right.
341220	342220	The...
342220	346940	It's a movie about a girl just kicking everybody's dick around the room for fucking two hours,
346940	347940	right?
347940	349940	I guess so, yeah.
349940	352940	Yeah, all right.
353860	362060	Look, I don't get out that much, but I promise you that the...
362060	367580	The controversy over the e-scooters is definitely manufactured.
367580	369420	Thank you.
369420	371500	I see it as nothing but a boon.
371500	376860	I have never been troubled by a person riding around on a scooter that they rented with
376860	377860	an app.
377860	382900	I've seen them, I've puzzled at them, and then someone's explained them to me.
382900	388660	And my only thought was, this is fantastic, it'll probably take me years to muster the
388660	392940	courage to walk up to one and be like, so what do I do?
392940	395340	It's real fun, but...
395340	396340	Have you rid one?
396340	397340	Oh, yeah.
397340	399620	Up and down the shop.
399620	402820	Me and Dan have a shop now.
402820	403820	You haven't been on one?
403820	404820	Have you?
404820	405820	No, I've been on one.
405820	406820	It was a lot of fun.
406820	410140	I think that people just like being mad about stuff, right?
410140	412780	They used to be mad about rock and roll and now they're mad about scooters.
413300	416940	I'm not familiar with the beef about the e-scooters.
416940	419540	Well, in Santa Monica, there's a lot of these scooters.
419540	420540	Dan, take it away.
420540	421540	Well, I...
426540	429340	Dan takes it away?
429340	435940	I certainly don't want to blindly dismiss if anybody has a legitimate grievance.
435940	436940	I just...
436940	440740	It's sort of like, come on.
440740	444740	That is being used laterally and experimentally, as it should be.
444740	445740	Somebody...
445740	449620	You know, it's funny how culture progresses and things.
449620	456900	I think the impressiveness of it way outweighs any possible inconvenience.
456900	464660	The potential solutions, they just have these scooters and you just throw them out in the
464660	465660	street.
465660	466660	You just throw them.
466660	469740	They don't have stations.
469740	476380	It's sort of like GPS technology and these things that we associate with like bridling
476380	479180	us and, oh, we're all in a Orwellian society.
479180	482820	It's like, well, yeah, but it also means you could just take this fucking lump of metal
482820	483820	and just go...
483820	487580	Out on the sidewalk and just rolls and lands.
487580	488860	And if you find one...
488860	490100	Yeah, I walked out of my place.
490100	492500	There was one in the bush in front of my place.
492500	496300	I'm like, is this somebody that wants this back?
497300	500700	Did somebody drop this off to go take a pee and wants his back or can I just steal his
500700	501700	scooter?
501700	502700	I don't know what the protocol...
502700	505380	If it's in the bush, I think he's hiding it so you can't find it so he can get it.
505380	506780	It wasn't inside the bush.
506780	507780	It was just resting.
507780	508780	It was nestling.
508780	514900	Somebody visited your neighbor and they left it there like we did with dirt bikes in 83.
514900	517980	You ride your dirt bike and then you fucking ditch it and you run in and play Atari.
517980	521380	Yeah, but somebody stole my red line dirt bike and I was fucking pissed off.
521380	525180	Well, yeah, because it was your dirt bike to steal and now imagine a world where, okay,
525180	529580	who needs to own this piece of shit and just taking it to my friend's house to play Atari.
529580	532300	Let's say I go to your place on one of these East Scooters, right?
532300	533300	You know what?
533300	535100	I'm not walking or driving a dance place.
535100	536100	I'm going to take one of these...
536100	537100	He's a scooter.
537100	538380	I found a scooter in a bush.
538380	539540	I live in Chelsea.
539540	542300	He lives in Upper West Side.
542300	543300	Yeah.
543300	544300	That tracks.
544300	546300	That's a bit of a ride of an East Scooter.
546300	547300	I'm going to play some Atari.
547300	548620	I would just take the A train.
548620	549620	Okay.
549620	552660	But anyway, but let's say I go, oh, I found a scooter in a bush.
552660	553660	What's it say?
553740	555140	The first ride is only a dollar.
555140	557420	I figure out how to make it work.
557420	558420	You...
558420	559420	Sure there's a QR code.
559420	560420	Yeah, you scan it.
560420	565700	And now I'm on a thing and now it's going and I'm in a suit and I'm like, I look like
565700	570500	a vampire and scooter.
570500	574380	And I get to your place and then I drop it off, just leave it.
574380	575380	Just leave it.
575380	577380	And then I come out and go, where's my scooter?
577380	580140	Well, now you don't have a ride home, but yeah, I mean, it's not guaranteed because
580140	581500	someone could come by and find it.
581500	582500	Just fucking scoop up my scooter.
582500	584220	You can also locate them with your...
584220	585540	You can go like, where's the nearest one?
585540	586540	You can go find it.
586540	587540	Yeah.
587540	588540	You can keep...
588540	589540	Can I stash it?
589540	590540	Like, can I put it in your garage?
590540	591740	Well, you can take it into the house.
591740	592740	Yeah.
592740	593740	Or you can just stay renting it.
593740	595140	But then someone goes, where's my nearest scooter?
595140	596460	And they go, oh, Dan Harmon's house.
596460	597460	Oh, is that true?
597460	598460	That's what I'm confused about.
598460	599460	You stay renting it.
599460	600460	Like, okay.
600460	602940	So if you went to the 7-Eleven, Jeff, you just...
602940	604740	You don't unrent it.
604740	608460	And then that means if someone comes up to try and get it, they can't because it's already
608460	609460	in use by you.
609460	612060	So that bush scooter might have already been like...
612060	613060	You're paying for the time.
613060	614060	Yeah.
614060	615060	Yeah.
615060	616060	You pay for it in time.
616060	617060	Oh, that's perfect.
617060	618060	Yeah.
618060	619060	But then you get paid to charge it.
619060	621060	So if you take a scooter home and charge it, you get like 10 bucks for that.
621060	623060	Let's see if Frank Jeffers would like it.
623060	624060	It's awesome.
624060	625060	Here's the problem.
625060	630380	It was rolled out in Santa Monica, which just has garbage traffic and especially garbage
630380	633060	bike traffic, which doesn't integrate well with street traffic.
633060	634060	It's already hard for bikes.
634060	635060	That's...
635060	636060	I get that.
636060	637060	Right.
637060	638060	It's already hard enough for bicyclists.
638060	639060	But that's the thing is.
639060	641380	So all the problems that apply to bicyclists are now applying to scooters.
641380	645020	But since they're easier to use and you don't have to go out and be a weird biker to drive
645020	646500	a bike, don't get me wrong.
646500	648180	If you like a bike, that's good.
648180	650540	But anyone can do it.
650540	654740	So we're having more of a traffic problem because all this bike, you know, what is essentially
654740	658140	bike traffic is now being forced to contend with road traffic.
658140	661060	And that's a problem because the roads weren't built for bikes.
661060	663980	But that's a problem for bikes and not scooters.
663980	666060	It's just a problem.
666060	668460	It's bad etiquette on a bicycle to be on the sidewalk.
668460	670580	I hate when bikers are on the sidewalk.
670780	674300	But now scooters are all over the goddamn sidewalk and I'm going to get killed by a family of
674300	675300	scooter people.
675300	676300	Right.
676300	678900	But you would have got killed by a bike two weeks ago.
678900	681420	So you're just fearing rock and roll.
681420	686700	I just want to add this as a former LA bicyclist, I just want to add, I'd rather have people
686700	689700	hate me for being on the sidewalk than fucking die.
689700	690700	Right.
690700	694380	Because it's not a bicycle friendly city anyways, blah, blah, blah.
694380	698940	A lot of bicyclists get killed in the road by drivers and stuff.
698940	701340	That's a huge issue in LA, right?
701340	702340	And they have the right of way.
702340	706460	And yet they're getting like probably hurt as if they were motorcyclists who know what
706460	707460	they're signing up for.
707460	709620	Sorry if you're out there and you got injured in a motorcycle accident.
709620	711340	I'm just being glib.
711340	714780	But I mean, bicycles can't split lanes and stuff.
714780	716260	You're just riding on the side of the road.
716260	719700	Look, I get I get frustrated by a bicyclist in front of me too.
719700	724780	But then I go like, Dan, we live near each other, Spencer, if you're down with us, we
724780	725780	can do it together.
725780	726780	I'd love to.
726780	728500	Let's let's take one of these scooters.
728540	731380	Let's find some of these scooters and fucking just like take it to the streets.
731380	732380	Like, fuck.
732380	733380	Well, I do want to break that.
733380	734380	Yeah.
734380	736260	And go like, let's learn to do this.
736260	740060	Like, you know, so that because it's like, yeah, I want to know how to do it.
740060	741060	It's great.
741060	742740	How do you know if the battery is going to die on it?
742740	746060	It'll tell you when you scan or looking for them.
746060	747060	It's great.
747060	748060	Spencer.
748060	749060	Spencer.
749060	750060	You got all the answers today, man.
750060	751060	I'm sorry.
751060	752060	Well, that's what we want to do.
752060	754500	What's in that fucking treasure basket you've got?
754500	755500	All the answers.
755500	759420	All right.
759420	769100	So yeah, I was I was eating dinner with my friend and we were talking about our dads
769100	771740	and like like sayings and things.
771740	775300	It was actually Heath who you remember from the dad fish episode.
775300	776300	Oh, yeah.
776300	782020	We were having dinner and we were so the topic of dads had come up again and like he attributed
782020	786460	the saying to his dad, which I have heard before and I wrote it down because I was like,
786460	791260	I really have always had a problem with the saying that his dad would say, you know, like
791260	795620	if you if you would go like, I wish I wish we could have gone to the zoo today.
795620	800580	And then like his dad would say, well, wish in one hand and shit in the other and see
800580	803420	which one fills up faster.
803420	810220	That's the fucking most awful thing I've ever heard.
810220	813780	It just doesn't it doesn't scan for me.
813780	814780	It doesn't.
814780	816900	You don't wish into anything.
816900	823220	I like like like it almost makes its own counter argument because it's sort of like like you're
823220	829020	one hair's a breath away from saying fill one hand with wishes and fill the other hand
829020	833340	with shit and see which is more valuable.
833340	836660	You get a handful of shit.
836660	837660	We'll see.
837660	842780	A handful of wishes is like the ratio of value to the amount of you have to wash it.
842780	843780	It's like amazing.
843780	845100	You could wish for a toilet.
845100	850420	You could wish for like, it just seems like it's just saying that it's more practical
850420	852860	to fill your one hand with shit.
852860	854540	But that's not sustainable.
854540	857380	Your hand fills right up.
857380	862020	If you're wishing into your hand, you'll be fucking doing it for weeks.
862020	864220	I got two handful of wishes right now.
864220	866260	And you can still use them to do stuff.
866260	867260	Yeah.
867260	870940	I wish Spencer would tell me what's in that fucking lunchbox on his desk.
870940	873780	I got a bunch of pocket operators in it.
873780	874780	Look.
874780	875780	Oh, whoa.
875780	876780	Yeah.
876780	877780	Wow.
877780	878780	There you go.
878780	879780	Pocket operators.
879780	880780	They make music.
880780	881900	I don't even know what that is.
881900	882900	It's good.
882900	886020	They're like little synthesizers that the kids are doing.
886020	887460	All the kids.
887460	888460	They love them.
888460	895140	What makes Sammy run by Bud Shilberg, kind of the antagonist in it is Sammy Glick.
895140	898860	And he says, it's like about the Hollywood system back in the like 30s, 40s, 50s?
898860	899860	I don't know.
899860	900860	It's been a while.
900860	901860	Sixties.
901860	903620	No, it's poor that.
903620	908060	And he says, your friend doesn't want to write that, like punch up your script for $50.
908060	911980	And he goes, you tell someone so if he doesn't like $50, he can shit in his hat, pull it
911980	916340	over his head and call it curls.
916340	919380	That's the best thing.
919380	923260	I think a lot of people get away with invoking shit and he's like quick statements like counting
923260	924500	on you to not think twice about it.
924500	928020	My dad used to say, if I want any shit out of you, I'll squeeze your head.
928020	929020	Like.
929020	930020	Wait, what?
930020	931020	Yeah.
931020	934580	But then he would often add, and it'll come out of your ears because I think he thought
934580	935860	that, wait, this kid's four years old.
935860	938300	He doesn't even understand what I'm saying.
938300	939700	But he understands child abuse.
939700	942900	Well, I was just saying like, if I want shit out of you, I'll squeeze your head.
942900	946300	And then I think he'd see a blank stare and be like, it'll come out of your ears.
947300	948300	Because your head's full of shit.
948300	950580	That softens the blow of that statement.
950580	952980	Well, it just it helps the joke land, I guess.
952980	953980	I don't know if that's your goal.
953980	955460	What's the first part?
955460	958140	If I need shit, I want any shit out of you out of you.
958140	959140	Squeeze your head.
959140	961740	Well, you know, there's an easier way to do it.
961740	962740	Squeeze the butt.
962740	963740	Well, yeah.
963740	972460	First feed them, give them a hot meal, provide for them and just actually just wait.
972460	973460	You don't even have to squeeze them.
973460	974620	That's what I'm saying.
974620	978580	If I want, Dan, if I want any shit out of you, I'm going to take you to Arby's.
978580	982780	If I want any shit out of you, I'll keep going to work from nine to five and accepting the
982780	986740	accountability that comes with reproduction and providing you with a...
986740	990180	I will wait six to eight hours after I've fed you.
990180	997020	And I'll put a special trap under the toilet because apparently I'm in this for shit.
997020	998020	Not wishes.
998020	1000340	You should have put a wish trap under your butt.
1000340	1005100	What if you can shit wishes?
1005100	1009020	The whole value of wishes is that they have zero rest mass.
1009020	1011180	That means they can move at the speed of light.
1011180	1015100	You can wish a thousand times, it won't cost you anything.
1015100	1016580	Wish, wish, wish, wish, wish, wish.
1016580	1018660	Like I didn't suffer anything.
1018660	1019660	That's the whole point.
1019660	1022900	Fucking wish away, motherfuckers.
1022900	1024100	You can't flush a wish.
1024100	1025100	You don't have to poop.
1025100	1027500	It costs you nothing to wish.
1027500	1029300	You know what it profits you every once in a while?
1029300	1032300	You come up with a fucking e-scooter business.
1032300	1035300	I wish I was a fucking millionaire.
1035300	1036300	That's the whole idea.
1036300	1039100	I wish, wish, wishity, wish, wish.
1039100	1040100	Fucking wish away.
1040100	1042100	Don't shit in your hand.
1042100	1044460	Someone wished a toilet existed.
1044460	1046460	That guy was smart.
1046460	1050380	Or lady.
1050380	1052260	Madam crapper.
1052260	1054300	I wish I didn't just shit in my hand.
1054300	1055300	That's the thing.
1056300	1062300	Shit in one hand, or wish in one hand, shit in the other, and see which one fills up faster.
1062300	1068300	All right, dad, I went away and did what you said, and I have a handful of shit.
1068300	1070300	See?
1070300	1072300	I still don't get your point, man.
1072300	1074300	I just said I wish you were a better dad.
1074300	1076300	You could fill up.
1076300	1078300	I still don't understand your point.
1078300	1080300	I just have shit in my hand.
1080300	1083300	I feel like I already had that in the form of your fatherhood.
1083300	1087300	You should have called his bluff and go, all right, give me 20 minutes.
1087300	1094300	And then come back out with a handful of shit and another hand and go, the wish is filled up faster.
1094300	1095300	I mean, how do you know?
1095300	1096300	Like, what is a wish way?
1096300	1098300	What is its mass?
1098300	1100300	Like, wishes are the only part of humanity.
1100300	1102300	That's our redeeming quality to be able to wish.
1102300	1103300	Penguins can't wish.
1103300	1106300	We're going to fuck them.
1106300	1108300	Talk to penguins in 50 years.
1108300	1110300	Like, you won't be able to.
1110300	1111300	You know why?
1111300	1112300	They couldn't wish.
1112300	1113300	They could.
1113300	1114300	What did we wish for?
1114300	1116300	Greenhouse effect.
1116300	1117300	Indirectly.
1117300	1118300	We didn't really want that.
1118300	1120300	We wished for cars.
1120300	1123300	Penguins just wished for tuna, I think I assume.
1123300	1124300	I don't know.
1124300	1125300	Or salmon.
1125300	1129300	Penguin should have wished for hands.
1129300	1131300	But they can't hold anything.
1131300	1133300	They can't even hold their own shit.
1133300	1136300	You try to hold shit in the penguin flipper?
1136300	1138300	It's not going to fall right off.
1138300	1141300	I don't want to throw penguins under the bus at a time when they're probably under a lot
1141300	1143300	of fire from the climate.
1143300	1147300	They should have wished for the retention of flight.
1147300	1152800	Like, what makes a bird of all creatures think maybe we should get back into the ocean?
1152800	1157500	Yeah, they should have wished that they didn't have to carry their child's egg on their feet
1157500	1160300	for four months while their spouse was on the fishing.
1160300	1163300	I'm a little iffy even on the mammals that go back.
1163300	1166300	All due respect to my boys, the dolphins.
1167300	1168300	Props.
1168300	1169300	Westside.
1169300	1171300	We get it.
1171300	1173300	Maybe shit was going ham up here.
1173300	1176300	You were like a dog creature.
1176300	1178300	Maybe I could have flippers that go back.
1178300	1181300	Is this your influence of hanging out with Dave Klein that you have all this new...
1181300	1183300	I guess I'm kind of going off of his...
1183300	1186300	Maybe I'm learning to be encouraged by him.
1186300	1188300	Maybe if he's happy, I'm happy.
1188300	1189300	Maybe it's happening.
1189300	1192300	But no, it's like whales were probably these brontosaurus,
1192300	1194300	and they're like, this is fucking bullshit.
1194300	1198300	I'm on your side as a brontosaurus creature, like a Loch Ness Monster.
1198300	1200300	That's what a whale would have looked like before it went back.
1200300	1203300	It was like experimenting with like...
1203300	1206300	Well, I've been told that if I start breathing oxygen,
1206300	1208300	I can eat leaves and hang out.
1208300	1210300	And then it's like...
1212300	1214300	And then some thing comes out,
1214300	1217300	disembowels, and I was like, fuck this.
1218300	1219300	And it goes back.
1219300	1221300	I'm like on that guy's side.
1221300	1222300	I'm like, good for you.
1222300	1225300	Do you know what a Dave Klein whale says?
1231300	1233300	All right, well, let's bring out Rob Schwab.
1247300	1249300	Something exotic is about to happen, I'm certain.
1250300	1252300	I can't even see.
1260300	1262300	Well, you know what?
1264300	1267300	Dan's leaving the stage as Rob takes the stage
1267300	1270300	after taking a Dan's popcorn.
1271300	1273300	Rob tests the new chair.
1273300	1275300	It doesn't look more comfortable.
1280300	1282300	What do you think?
1282300	1284300	Is it comfortable?
1284300	1286300	It's kind of like a high chair.
1286300	1287300	Yeah.
1287300	1289300	Is that what we're...
1289300	1291300	Is that the angle we're going for?
1291300	1293300	People are trying to make you happy, Rob.
1293300	1295300	We're trying to make you more comfortable.
1295300	1296300	Cushions!
1296300	1298300	I got a cushion.
1298300	1300300	Do you want mine?
1303300	1305300	I knew it, I knew it.
1305300	1308300	I still can't see, but I know what's happening.
1308300	1312300	Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
1312300	1314300	There's a new chair.
1321300	1323300	This chair does look comfortable.
1324300	1328300	This has been Harmontown Musical Chairs.
1330300	1332300	Thanks, Steve.
1332300	1335300	I win, I win!
1335300	1337300	I win!
1344300	1347300	Shrav, what are your thoughts on Senator McCain dying?
1354300	1356300	Here's the thing.
1356300	1358300	Hotcast dynamite.
1358300	1359300	Here's the thing.
1359300	1360300	Give me my popcorn.
1360300	1362300	No, no.
1362300	1364300	All right, you can have a little...
1364300	1366300	Give us thoughts on John McCain dying.
1366300	1370300	I think it's sad when anything dies, you know?
1370300	1374300	But I didn't share his belief system,
1374300	1377300	but he seemed like he was trying to do some good stuff.
1377300	1379300	He fought for our country.
1379300	1380300	He got...
1380300	1382300	He's a POW, you know?
1382300	1383300	He did some...
1383300	1385300	He tried to do some good stuff.
1385300	1388300	Spencer, what do you think about Rob's thoughts on John McCain dying?
1388300	1391300	I think they were too safe.
1391300	1393300	I don't think he took a real stand.
1393300	1397300	Kind of like what a rivet would have as a thought,
1397300	1398300	like a frog or a...
1398300	1401300	Rivets are a valuable part of society.
1401300	1403300	Let me ask you one question.
1403300	1409300	Do you usually go to frogs for political commentary?
1409300	1410300	No, you don't.
1410300	1413300	So don't go to me for political commentary either.
1413300	1417300	Go for me for chair criticisms.
1417300	1421300	Shrav, what do you think about the genocide going on in Myanmar right now?
1421300	1424300	I'm against it. Next question.
1424300	1425300	I can't.
1425300	1426300	Too safe.
1426300	1427300	Too safe.
1427300	1432300	Because the people committing it are just trying to keep genocide from happening.
1432300	1433300	I don't even...
1433300	1435300	I think popcorn's bad for the show. You guys...
1435300	1436300	I think it's good.
1436300	1437300	It's good for the tummy.
1437300	1439300	Nobody wants to hear people eat during a thing.
1439300	1440300	They'll live.
1440300	1441300	Like when I...
1441300	1442300	They can watch.
1442300	1444300	When there's a commercial and there's people eating,
1444300	1445300	like a Carl's Jr. commercial,
1445300	1448300	the sound of people eating is going to fucking barf.
1448300	1449300	I was hungry.
1449300	1454300	I don't know how much Carl's Jr. ads amplify the sound of eating.
1454300	1455300	They usually...
1455300	1458300	I don't know that that's true.
1458300	1462300	I think that if anyone knows how unattractive the sound of eating is,
1462300	1464300	it's the companies trying to sell that.
1464300	1466300	Is there anybody in the audience...
1466300	1467300	Yes.
1467300	1468300	Preferably of the...
1468300	1471300	Of the persuasion, but I'm not gonna...
1471300	1473300	Hey, that was great, man.
1473300	1476300	Now go on.
1476300	1479300	Hey, if you're somebody in the audience, let me hear you say,
1479300	1480300	Yeah.
1480300	1481300	Yeah.
1481300	1483300	There's somebody in the audience.
1491300	1493300	Is there anybody in the audience that...
1493300	1495300	Yeah.
1495300	1497300	That is the...
1497300	1503300	That identifies as the kind of person that would like to wear a tiny backpack,
1503300	1504300	who also...
1504300	1506300	Wait for it. Sorry.
1506300	1511300	Who also would give us honest feedback from their perspective
1511300	1515300	on what they expect from the show moving forward.
1515300	1519300	Okay, all right. You're committed? Okay, come on up.
1519300	1520300	All right.
1520300	1521300	All right.
1524300	1526300	From the second row.
1528300	1529300	Hello.
1529300	1532300	From the backpack.
1532300	1533300	Your name is...
1533300	1534300	Nova.
1534300	1535300	Nova.
1535300	1536300	Through the galaxy.
1536300	1539300	Across the Milky Way.
1539300	1543300	Your backpack is here for you.
1543300	1544300	Here you go, Nova.
1544300	1547300	With some plastic on the handle.
1547300	1551300	Make sure you cut off the tags.
1551300	1553300	Major Tom.
1553300	1554300	Cut off the tags.
1554300	1556300	Your name is Nova?
1556300	1557300	Nova, yeah.
1557300	1558300	Hello, Nova.
1558300	1561300	From Super Nova.
1561300	1563300	To the show-va.
1563300	1569300	Making over your backpack.
1569300	1571300	Nova.
1571300	1573300	Hey, hey, Nova.
1573300	1576300	Nova wasn't Planet of the Apes, the original Planet of the Apes.
1576300	1577300	I know.
1577300	1579300	Yeah? Is that what...
1580300	1581300	Hey, hey, hey.
1581300	1582300	One more thing.
1582300	1584300	Nova was a television show.
1584300	1585300	Yep.
1586300	1588300	Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
1588300	1589300	That's all I got.
1589300	1590300	A car.
1590300	1591300	What?
1591300	1592300	Oh, yeah, the Chevy.
1592300	1593300	A car, a star.
1594300	1596300	Yeah, you're probably an expert on this.
1596300	1597300	What else do you name it?
1598300	1599300	I've heard everything.
1599300	1603300	You know what would be better is what am I named after.
1603300	1604300	Don't answer that.
1604300	1605300	Don't answer that.
1605300	1606300	Don't answer that.
1606300	1607300	Don't answer that.
1607300	1609300	Okay, moving on to you.
1609300	1610300	Thevery.
1610300	1611300	What the fuck?
1611300	1619300	Nova, what do you think qualifies you to wear the coveted, tiny Rick and Morty backpack?
1619300	1620300	I don't know.
1620300	1622300	I'm a pretty huge super fan of Harmon Town.
1622300	1625300	I've been to almost every show at this theater.
1625300	1627300	And I love Rick and Morty very much.
1627300	1629300	I resent this line of questioning.
1629300	1630300	Yeah.
1630300	1631300	She doesn't have to prove nothing.
1631300	1633300	Yeah, I mean, it's a consumer product.
1633300	1635300	You just have to want the backpack.
1635300	1636300	You don't have to earn the backpack.
1636300	1637300	I love the backpack.
1637300	1638300	Well, okay.
1638300	1639300	I have a follow-up question.
1639300	1642300	What do you think is going to go into that backpack first?
1642300	1645300	What are you going to carry around in your smart little tote bag?
1645300	1647300	All right, I'll move it.
1650300	1652300	Phone, wallet.
1652300	1653300	Phone and wallet.
1653300	1654300	That's fair.
1654300	1655300	Is that one thing?
1655300	1656300	Like a hyphen?
1656300	1658300	No, I don't have the little thing with the heart.
1658300	1662300	I'm so sorry about my friend.
1662300	1664300	No, that's totally cool.
1664300	1668300	Hey, what are you doing for Labor Day weekend, Nova?
1668300	1671300	Labor Day weekend, I'll be showing off that backpack.
1671300	1672300	You got any tattoos?
1672300	1677300	Yeah, go get some tattoos on the backpack on Labor Day weekend.
1677300	1681300	You want to go get a tattoo on Labor Day weekend with me and Rob?
1681300	1685300	I'm going to go see the Meg on Labor Day weekend.
1685300	1688300	Yeah, some empty seats for the man.
1688300	1691300	I try to bring a young person up and...
1691300	1694300	I try to relate the Meg.
1695300	1697300	Traumatizing them.
1697300	1700300	They're going to be like, I don't even know what happened.
1700300	1703300	It was like Thanksgiving at my uncle's.
1703300	1704300	This is much better.
1704300	1706300	Okay, as long as you're having a good time.
1706300	1710300	But also, and then also if the audience is having a good time,
1710300	1714300	but then also on top of that, I should have a good time.
1714300	1715300	Yeah, it's your show.
1715300	1720300	We'll stop being such a fucking stick in the deck and get in the game, man.
1720300	1722300	I'm not a stick in the deck.
1723300	1726300	I'm not a stick in the deck. Take that back.
1726300	1727300	Take it back.
1727300	1730300	Your arms are folded, your dick is folded.
1732300	1734300	This is an allowable posture for somebody...
1734300	1737300	You got some snot dripping off your mustache.
1737300	1738300	That's vodka.
1738300	1740300	This isn't your show.
1740300	1741300	Are you kissing?
1741300	1743300	Did you just...
1743300	1745300	Somebody's acting like a real stick in the deck over there.
1745300	1746300	Nova...
1747300	1749300	Nova...
1749300	1751300	I don't want to put you in between this.
1751300	1752300	Nova...
1752300	1754300	But choose between me and Trump.
1754300	1757300	Nova, you must use the power crystals.
1757300	1758300	Your backpack is on the line.
1758300	1760300	Nova, you must use the power crystals
1760300	1763300	or you won't be able to open the galaxy door.
1763300	1765300	Nova, believe in yourself.
1765300	1767300	Nova, please.
1767300	1771300	Nova, give me a name, Nova.
1771300	1774300	What's my name, Rob?
1774300	1776300	I just want to die sometimes.
1776300	1778300	Is that why you listen to the show?
1778300	1780300	Because you sometimes just want to die,
1780300	1782300	and you're like, Dean knows what it's like.
1782300	1783300	He gets sad.
1783300	1784300	Yeah.
1784300	1785300	Okay, good. That's what I thought.
1785300	1787300	And so he kind of ruins it sometimes, right?
1787300	1788300	No.
1788300	1789300	Okay.
1789300	1790300	That was my job.
1790300	1792300	I don't like when he makes you legitimately upset.
1792300	1794300	No, but he's not upset.
1794300	1795300	I know.
1795300	1796300	You get his arms.
1796300	1798300	Look at his posture.
1798300	1801300	I get concerned about shape of show.
1801300	1803300	I get concerned about $10.
1803300	1806300	I get concerned about you driving from Silver Lake,
1806300	1808300	wherever you're coming from.
1808300	1809300	Santa Clarita.
1809300	1810300	Santa Clarita.
1810300	1813300	I mean, that's a long drive.
1813300	1815300	And then you choke up his money, you wait in line.
1815300	1817300	A show's called Santa Clarita Diet.
1817300	1819300	Do you ever watch that?
1819300	1821300	I want you to have a good time.
1821300	1822300	I always have a good time.
1822300	1823300	So, yes.
1823300	1825300	I love you and I love Rob.
1825300	1826300	Okay.
1826300	1829300	Nova, what do you do for a living, if I may ask?
1829300	1831300	Nothing currently.
1831300	1832300	I am unemployed.
1832300	1833300	That is cool.
1833300	1834300	Hey!
1834300	1836300	I've never been applauded for that.
1836300	1837300	You can charge e-scooters.
1837300	1838300	You can go grab them.
1838300	1839300	You can take them and charge them.
1839300	1840300	Yeah, man.
1840300	1841300	I see people doing that.
1841300	1842300	It's crazy.
1842300	1843300	I've never seen one of those.
1843300	1844300	Yeah.
1844300	1845300	They're on the coast.
1845300	1847300	I thought they were self-mo-powered.
1847300	1850300	They are self-mo-powered.
1850300	1851300	They need to be charged.
1851300	1852300	And then there's, like, cultures of kids.
1852300	1855300	Like, they roll in scooter-charging gangs.
1855300	1856300	Yeah, they do.
1856300	1857300	Or with each other.
1857300	1858300	That sounds fun.
1858300	1859300	Hey, man.
1859300	1861300	That scooter's the property of sticky.
1861300	1862300	That's on my turn.
1862300	1864300	I don't know this sticky.
1864300	1867300	But I know this scooter belongs to the Jek boys.
1867300	1868300	Ha!
1868300	1869300	Get them!
1869300	1871300	And they have scooter fights.
1871300	1873300	But all the scooters are out of battery.
1873300	1875300	You're never alone.
1875300	1877300	They inch forward on scooters going.
1877300	1880300	And then trying to, like, steer it with one hand.
1880300	1881300	They're all wobbling.
1881300	1884300	Yeah, it's hard to do Jerome Robbins' choreography
1884300	1885300	when you're on a scooter.
1885300	1886300	What?
1888300	1890300	Here's my concern, Nova.
1890300	1892300	Can I ask you, is podcast culture,
1892300	1894300	do you listen to podcasts when you're, like,
1894300	1895300	going to sleep at night?
1895300	1897300	Like, you make it part of your life?
1897300	1900300	I listen to podcasts just throughout, like, my whole day.
1900300	1902300	Because I feel too, I don't know, kind of, like,
1902300	1904300	lonely or sad with, like, nothing on.
1904300	1905300	Yeah.
1905300	1906300	Yeah.
1906300	1908300	So I listen to Harmon Town or Game Grumps,
1908300	1909300	which is technically not a podcast.
1909300	1912300	But there's no, like, face cam.
1912300	1914300	So it's, like, a podcast.
1914300	1915300	Right.
1915300	1917300	Yeah, I don't listen to a wide variety of things.
1917300	1922300	So, like, my concern, as an old-timer,
1922300	1926300	is I'm thinking about you, kids.
1926300	1930300	I'm like, oh, if I was Nova and I was going to sleep
1930300	1932300	and I was listening to Harmon Town,
1932300	1935300	can I rely on this show to, like, have, like, a consistency
1935300	1937300	and a, like, sort of a, like,
1937300	1939300	oh, I'm coming home to Harmon Town.
1939300	1943300	But it's like, like, I just, that's when I express anxiety
1943300	1945300	is that's what I'm worried about.
1945300	1948300	I definitely have, like, a coming home to Harmon Town of, like,
1948300	1951300	I don't know, there's so much diversity in, like, 300 episodes,
1951300	1952300	you know?
1952300	1955300	There's at least four white people up here.
1955300	1957300	That's true.
1957300	1959300	Four white men with diversity.
1959300	1960300	I know, it's a little sad.
1960300	1963300	The hallmark of Harmon Town is it's our rich diversity.
1963300	1965300	Yes, diversity.
1965300	1968300	I don't know how diversified this show is.
1968300	1969300	It's not my fault.
1969300	1970300	Yeah.
1970300	1974300	We've had, in 301 episodes, we've had four women
1974300	1975300	on stage.
1975300	1977300	Anyways, continue Nova.
1977300	1980300	Yeah, Harmon Town's not good for sleep.
1980300	1983300	I don't know, it's like the live show thing
1983300	1986300	and then it's like the diversity of, like, there might be a guest
1986300	1988300	and that's, like, their voice is different or whatever.
1988300	1991300	How does that slap, well, like, is there a certain time of day
1991300	1995300	or a certain activity that the podcast works especially best for?
1995300	1996300	It's best for Sims.
1996300	1998300	Just, like, making houses in Sims.
1998300	1999300	Oh.
1999300	2000300	Sims 4?
2000300	2001300	Sims 4?
2001300	2002300	Yeah, no.
2003300	2005300	Because I've listened to it while I play Minecraft
2005300	2006300	and it does kind of work.
2006300	2008300	I feel like when you talk about Minecraft, I'm like, yeah,
2008300	2009300	that's what I feel about Sims.
2009300	2012300	Should we get Sims as a sponsor and have Nova do an ad for us
2012300	2013300	right now?
2013300	2014300	You can try it.
2014300	2015300	Nova, do a little ad reading.
2015300	2016300	We're going to pitch this.
2016300	2017300	Do a spec ad.
2022300	2023300	Hey.
2023300	2027300	So, Sims, very broken, very fun.
2027300	2029300	Yeah, you get to live as little people,
2029300	2031300	but they don't do anything interesting.
2031300	2032300	They just kind of go around the house.
2032300	2034300	You make yourself food and stuff.
2034300	2035300	You can have little careers.
2035300	2038300	I just like making houses because it's fun.
2038300	2042300	Do you like green diamonds floating above heads?
2042300	2044300	Do you like trapping people in swimming pools?
2044300	2047300	Do you like watching your Sims go to the bathroom for a weirdly long time?
2047300	2049300	Do you like making your Sims pee on the floor
2049300	2051300	and mop it up while crying?
2051300	2053300	No, I don't like doing bad things to my Sims.
2053300	2054300	It makes me feel sad.
2054300	2055300	I get to attach to them.
2055300	2056300	I'm like, they're people.
2056300	2057300	They are people.
2057300	2058300	I just like making houses.
2058300	2059300	Mostly playing is not my favorite.
2059300	2060300	Okay.
2060300	2061300	Is it?
2061300	2062300	I don't think so.
2062300	2063300	I don't know.
2063300	2065300	I started Sims and I played it for a while.
2065300	2068300	And then you come back home and it just flies everywhere
2068300	2069300	and everyone's bummed out.
2069300	2070300	I'm like, this is...
2070300	2072300	I don't know why everyone who plays Sims seems to be so bad at it.
2072300	2074300	It's pretty easy for me.
2074300	2076300	You have to be dedicated to it.
2076300	2077300	It's like...
2077300	2078300	Yeah, yeah.
2078300	2080300	You can't just like leave it on and the Sims do weird things
2080300	2082300	and you're like, no, you have to go to work.
2082300	2083300	And you're like all invested.
2083300	2086300	You're like, no, you're going to be late for work.
2086300	2090300	I do get like that Tomagotchi anxiety.
2090300	2091300	Yeah.
2091300	2092300	Oh, absolutely.
2092300	2096300	Like the idea of a game that if I leave it and I fuck up by doing nothing,
2096300	2098300	I'm like, that's what I'm trying to get away from in life.
2098300	2103300	Are there any other events where you get Tomagotchi anxiety?
2103300	2105300	Like, you know, like...
2105300	2109300	Like if you're like waiting in line at the bank,
2109300	2112300	you get like a Tomagotchi anxiety
2112300	2116300	or like if traffic is like a parking lot on the 405,
2116300	2117300	we've all been there.
2117300	2119300	Just imagine anyone listening to this show.
2119300	2123300	Tomagotchi anxiety or like your mom is talking to you.
2123300	2125300	You can't get a word in edgewise.
2125300	2129300	That's when I get the Tomagotchi anxiety.
2129300	2131300	You still like us both?
2131300	2132300	Yeah.
2132300	2133300	Okay. All right.
2133300	2134300	Well, I don't get it.
2134300	2135300	I like the contrast.
2135300	2141300	I feel like Schwab's level of chaos is leveled up because of his new chair.
2141300	2142300	He's feeling very relaxed.
2142300	2143300	It's very free.
2143300	2146300	I've never been happier.
2146300	2147300	I can tell.
2147300	2150300	Does anyone perceive the real story here,
2150300	2153300	which is me throwing buckets of enabling on him,
2153300	2155300	trying to make him happy?
2155300	2159300	Like, should I dig a pit of spikes and have him fall into it and hurt himself?
2159300	2162300	All I do is that the chairs have been getting more cushioned.
2162300	2164300	I keep appeasing him more and more.
2164300	2166300	I flew him to Boston.
2166300	2169300	No one's telling this story.
2169300	2171300	You're telling the story on the show.
2171300	2173300	I know, and it's uncharismatic for me to tell it.
2173300	2175300	Someone else has to tell it.
2175300	2176300	Anyways, he's a monster.
2176300	2178300	I don't know if anyone else can understand the complexities
2178300	2181300	between you guys' 20-year-old nation's chair.
2181300	2183300	Dan flew Rob out to Boston.
2183300	2185300	Thanks.
2188300	2191300	Was there more to this story?
2191300	2194300	Aren't you guys going to buy weed together, I heard?
2194300	2196300	Yeah, we're going to.
2196300	2198300	Okay, so here's the deal.
2198300	2200300	Two weeks ago, Rob approached me.
2200300	2204300	And I go, hey, Spencer, can you teach me how to vape?
2206300	2208300	And Spencer said...
2208300	2210300	Go on.
2210300	2211300	What's my line?
2211300	2212300	Yes.
2212300	2213300	Oh. Yeah, yeah.
2213300	2214300	Okay.
2214300	2218300	And now, we're going to do it on Wednesday.
2218300	2220300	You guys are going to go to a dispensary?
2220300	2222300	Yeah, I told Shrob I would show him the ropes.
2222300	2223300	Wait a minute.
2223300	2224300	A dispensary?
2224300	2226300	Yeah, yeah, it sounds the same.
2226300	2227300	Oh, yeah.
2227300	2230300	Let's run through some names that sound like Spencer.
2230300	2231300	Suspender.
2231300	2232300	Oh, we've done this before.
2232300	2233300	Suspense.
2233300	2234300	Suspension.
2234300	2236300	Dispense.
2236300	2237300	Dispenser.
2237300	2239300	That's about all of them.
2239300	2242300	But, no, I told Shrob we'd take him to the store
2242300	2244300	next time I was going, but I haven't been smoking weed,
2244300	2246300	so it took a lot longer.
2246300	2248300	So next time you see me, I'm going to be like,
2248300	2251300	oh, peace and love, man.
2252300	2256300	Man, you guys got to just relax.
2256300	2259300	Peace and love, man.
2259300	2263300	Why are you doing all the war, man?
2263300	2266300	I'm talking about peace and love, man.
2266300	2269300	We need to get out and just smoke some God.
2269300	2273300	Get out of Maui, Maui, and leave this shit, man.
2273300	2277300	Spencer, you know a dispensary that turns Rob
2277300	2279300	into a black exploitation character?
2279300	2283300	Man, you need to get down with the grass, man.
2283300	2285300	I'm going to smoke some vape.
2285300	2287300	I'm going to smoke all the vape.
2287300	2289300	Nova, do you vape it up?
2289300	2290300	Are you a vaporizer?
2290300	2291300	No.
2291300	2293300	I've never done weed or cigarettes or anything.
2293300	2294300	I'm not against it.
2294300	2295300	I just haven't done it.
2295300	2296300	Yeah.
2296300	2298300	If you feel different, you drive different.
2298300	2299300	What?
2305300	2306300	You know what I'm saying?
2306300	2307300	You what different?
2307300	2308300	You drive different.
2308300	2309300	I would assume so.
2309300	2311300	I got to go to this dispensary, man.
2311300	2312300	Yeah, man.
2312300	2313300	Fucking blow in my mind.
2313300	2314300	I'd probably like it.
2314300	2318300	Do they sell vape shirts and vape posters?
2318300	2321300	They sell vape hats and vape socks.
2321300	2322300	Fucking A, man.
2322300	2323300	Vape socks.
2323300	2324300	Vape socks.
2324300	2325300	What's a vape sock?
2325300	2327300	It's a sock for your vape.
2327300	2328300	All right.
2328300	2332300	I'm going to take four vape socks, a couple hats.
2332300	2335300	I'll take a vape.
2335300	2337300	It's worse when you're up here.
2337300	2339300	It's worse when you're on stage.
2339300	2340300	It's a lot of the show.
2340300	2341300	The show?
2341300	2342300	No, no, no.
2342300	2344300	I'll take three vapes.
2344300	2346300	The show, too.
2346300	2347300	Oh, my God.
2347300	2348300	Thank you.
2348300	2349300	I'm so glad I did.
2349300	2350300	This is why you're here.
2350300	2357300	I know you have to bring every single person up one at a time and go, like, see?
2357300	2362300	Like, but I mean, it did.
2363300	2367300	So were your parents, are they astronomers, public television supporters?
2367300	2368300	I don't know.
2368300	2369300	They're kind of hippies.
2369300	2370300	They like science.
2370300	2371300	They liked the show, I guess.
2371300	2374300	They like the stars kind of thing.
2374300	2375300	Carl Sagan kind of thing?
2375300	2379300	No, they wanted something unique, but not, like, weird.
2379300	2384300	And, yeah, they like science, and they're kind of, yeah, I don't know.
2384300	2388300	Are you a sciencey person, too?
2388300	2389300	I don't know.
2389300	2390300	I like psychology and sociology and stuff.
2390300	2392300	Not so much, like, the physical sciences.
2392300	2393300	I can't wrap my head around it.
2393300	2395300	Like, I don't care why a rock was formed.
2395300	2396300	I don't know.
2396300	2397300	They should have named you...
2397300	2398300	It seems important.
2398300	2400300	They should have named you Malthus.
2400300	2404300	What interests you about psychology and sociology?
2404300	2405300	Yeah.
2405300	2406300	Malthus.
2406300	2408300	Expound on those fascinations.
2408300	2409300	Like...
2409300	2410300	Okay.
2410300	2411300	She's smart, yeah.
2411300	2413300	The kind of stuff that fascinates you.
2413300	2414300	I don't even know.
2414300	2418300	But, well, I'll just go with the psychology-sociology thing, I guess.
2418300	2424300	I really like trying to figure out how people work.
2424300	2425300	I don't know.
2425300	2428300	I have Asperger's, so I'm always trying to, like...
2428300	2429300	Yeah!
2429300	2430300	Yeah!
2430300	2431300	I feel the same way.
2431300	2434300	I feel like I really need to understand people, because...
2434300	2435300	Why do people are doing what they're doing?
2435300	2437300	Yeah, because I just don't get it.
2437300	2438300	What are they thinking?
2438300	2439300	Yeah.
2439300	2440300	I don't understand.
2440300	2442300	I don't know why I'm doing what I'm doing.
2442300	2443300	I don't know what people...
2443300	2444300	Right, but you're right.
2444300	2445300	I like trying to figure out the things.
2445300	2449300	Yeah, it'd be comforting to think there was maybe a couple rules, yeah.
2449300	2453300	I would be very nice to know why people do some of the things they do.
2453300	2454300	Not even because I'm upset about it.
2454300	2455300	Just because it's like, why?
2455300	2456300	Why?
2456300	2457300	Why?
2457300	2458300	Why?
2458300	2459300	Why?
2459300	2460300	Why am I doing what I do?
2460300	2461300	So do you think...
2461300	2462300	Do you see yourself in this?
2462300	2464300	Look, this is a question grown-ups ask kids that gets frustrating.
2464300	2465300	So your answer...
2465300	2467300	You can plead the fifth.
2467300	2470300	But do you see yourself in any kind of vocation in particular?
2470300	2472300	Is there a fantasy job?
2472300	2476300	The only thing that I've really always been...
2476300	2479300	Everything that I see, I'm like, I want to do that, I want to do that, I want to do that.
2479300	2483300	But the thing that I've always been like, yes, that absolutely sounds amazing,
2483300	2485300	is I've always liked acting.
2485300	2486300	Like always.
2486300	2487300	Like theater acting.
2487300	2489300	Not like, I want to be a star or whatever.
2489300	2490300	But I don't know.
2490300	2491300	I just...
2491300	2492300	Yeah, I like being in plays and stuff.
2492300	2493300	Just showing up and doing the job.
2493300	2494300	Yeah, exactly.
2494300	2496300	There's not like take-home work.
2496300	2497300	I mean, there is.
2497300	2499300	But not like during the show's run, at least.
2499300	2500300	Did you do theater?
2500300	2501300	Like high school or college?
2501300	2502300	Yeah, I always did.
2502300	2506300	Like the second that I was old enough to be in the school play in elementary school,
2506300	2508300	because you weren't allowed to do it.
2508300	2509300	What play?
2509300	2510300	It was in fourth grade.
2510300	2511300	Peter Pan.
2511300	2512300	Who'd you play?
2512300	2513300	Gentlemen Starkey.
2513300	2514300	He's not like famous.
2514300	2517300	He's like, there's like Captain Hook, Smee, then Starkey.
2517300	2519300	And he was really like, unhappy.
2519300	2520300	Oh yeah, no, he's...
2520300	2521300	Or no, that's...
2521300	2522300	He was very fine.
2522300	2523300	Sorry, I was thinking of Smee.
2523300	2525300	That role is the anchor of the third act.
2525300	2526300	Yeah, actually.
2526300	2527300	He's a plot point.
2527300	2531300	Do you remember any of his lines?
2531300	2532300	No.
2532300	2536300	No, I just remember him being like, I gotta take my gun out.
2536300	2538300	And then Smee being like, dude, for real.
2538300	2540300	No, their children like stop.
2540300	2541300	I don't know.
2541300	2542300	It was really fun.
2542300	2543300	I like playing villains a lot.
2543300	2548300	Don't you wonder like if acting was a job that...
2548300	2549300	If all jobs kind of...
2549300	2554300	If there was some fantasy society where everything paid kind of in accordance with some sort
2554300	2556300	of shared value system.
2556300	2564300	Because acting has this built-in thing where it's like, well, maybe one day you'll be Batman.
2564300	2568300	And because one day you'll be Batman and then you'll buy a million houses...
2568300	2571300	You suffer now by being in little pet food commercials or whatever.
2571300	2573300	And so if you tell your mom, she's like, well, what are you doing?
2573300	2574300	Well, I'm acting.
2574300	2576300	And she's like, wow, I hope you get a break.
2576300	2578300	And she means like maybe one day you'll be Batman.
2578300	2581300	But it's like, well, that's not necessarily a result of me acting well.
2581300	2587300	And I'm kind of actually curious like people who...
2587300	2592300	Like if we really got to choose and we could make a living wage and you could like do backbreaking
2592300	2600300	acting work in a theater and it wasn't attached to this idea of my goal is to be Susan Sarandon.
2600300	2607300	And it was just actually, I would like to do this for my life if you as a society could provide me
2607300	2610300	with a guarantee that I can do it for 30 years.
2610300	2615300	Like we could come into Black Box Theater and go like, hello, I'm Aunt Susan.
2615300	2617300	And people would be like, yay.
2617300	2618300	Yeah, I think you can...
2618300	2621300	Do you think that everyone would be like, I want that job.
2621300	2622300	That's a privileged job?
2622300	2623300	Because I don't think so.
2623300	2624300	No.
2624300	2626300	I think people would be like, no, that sucks.
2626300	2629300	No, people think like if you say you want to be an actor or a singer, people are like,
2629300	2632300	oh, you know, just like, yeah, every little kid wants to be an actor or a singer
2632300	2634300	because they want to be famous and want people to pay attention to that stuff.
2634300	2639300	But if fame wasn't an actual thing and it was like you actually saw what it took to be like...
2639300	2644300	I would still love acting and I think a lot of people would never want to be an actor.
2644300	2647300	Yeah, it's kind of like washing dishes.
2647300	2649300	Yeah, I mean...
2649300	2654300	Is there a role that you, like if you could do any role, like on any, like either small theater
2654300	2659300	or like Broadway, like is there a certain role that you would freak out for?
2659300	2661300	I would, there's like a lot.
2661300	2667300	I would love to, there's a lot, I don't know, there's like long lists and stuff,
2667300	2671300	but I would absolutely love to be like, I don't know, I've been,
2671300	2676300	I've always been cast into like small character roles and then I've also never been considered
2676300	2679300	kind of feminine enough or masculine enough for any of the characters.
2679300	2683300	So I always end up with little bit roles and stuff that can kind of be gender neutral.
2683300	2687300	And I would love to be like a protagonist or something like Seymour in Little Shop of Horrors
2687300	2689300	or like something like that.
2689300	2692300	Let's construct you a gender neutral protagonist role and we'll do a...
2692300	2695300	Well, it could be a male role, but just if they would cast me in it and be like,
2695300	2697300	I'm allowed to play that role.
2697300	2700300	Let's figure something out and then we'll do an embarrassing improvised version of it.
2700300	2702300	Would you rather be a male lead in a show or a female lead?
2702300	2703300	Yeah.
2703300	2704300	Yeah?
2704300	2707300	Yeah, see, you as a Seymour would be fantastic, I would love it.
2707300	2708300	Thanks.
2708300	2711300	All right, then I'll be your, either your...
2711300	2714300	My Audrey.
2714300	2717300	Yeah, I'll be your plant, your Audrey.
2717300	2719300	My plant, I'd love to be the plant too.
2719300	2721300	That's a big dream, is to be the plant.
2721300	2723300	I would even have to be on stage, but I could just be tearing it up behind stage.
2723300	2724300	Oh yeah, you could really ham it up.
2724300	2726300	Act one, here we go.
2726300	2732300	This is Nova's, she's not auditioning, this is just her living her life.
2732300	2735300	I'm a plant.
2735300	2737300	I'm not doing any, of course.
2737300	2742300	Seymour, what do you, why are you, you're denying me?
2742300	2747300	Look, I know it's yes and, but this is a little, hmm.
2747300	2750300	Okay, Seymour, I understand, I respect your boundaries.
2750300	2752300	Thank you, Audrey, too.
2752300	2753300	I love you, please don't eat me.
2753300	2757300	You don't get to be a functioning plant without being able to work with your environment.
2757300	2759300	I get it.
2759300	2761300	Okay, all right, that's good.
2761300	2764300	Look, I would love to play along, but being on stage here is enough.
2764300	2766300	I gotta put up a boundary somewhere.
2766300	2768300	Sure.
2768300	2770300	That was a good plant, Dan.
2770300	2771300	I liked your plant.
2771300	2773300	It was very meek, which was interesting.
2773300	2775300	Yeah, I'm willing to take risks.
2775300	2777300	He's usually played very big and stuff.
2777300	2778300	Dan.
2778300	2783300	Dan, I just saw, Church and I went and saw a fantastic production.
2783300	2787300	It's in Hollywood if you guys are around until the 16th of Cabaret, which I love.
2787300	2793300	It's a really good production in a very tiny theater at the Lex, or the celebration theater.
2793300	2795300	It's called Cabaret at the Lex.
2795300	2796300	It's really, really good.
2796300	2798300	You like Cabaret?
2798300	2801300	I have not seen it, but I would love to.
2801300	2803300	Yeah, I recommend it.
2803300	2804300	You must go to it.
2804300	2806300	Dan, you want to do a little Cabaret for us?
2807300	2809300	Are you familiar with the film or the play?
2809300	2810300	Of course, front to back.
2810300	2812300	All right.
2812300	2813300	It's a musical.
2813300	2814300	Chicago, I know.
2814300	2815300	That's kind of similar.
2815300	2817300	What do you know about?
2817300	2822300	It's a musical about Nazi times.
2822300	2823300	Yeah, Nazi times.
2823300	2826300	And there's a Cabaret that you're in.
2826300	2829300	Okay, I'll just start doing a little umpire kind of intro.
2829300	2831300	I know Cabaret.
2831300	2833300	I know the whole show.
2833300	2838300	That's, of course, you're doing me a very well-known song.
2838300	2845300	There's a Cabaret starting right now.
2845300	2851300	You're about to see a Cabaret with me.
2851300	2855300	Does it matter if there's Nazis?
2855300	2859300	It doesn't matter if there's not Cabaret.
2859300	2864300	I have a Cabaret for you.
2864300	2867300	Subtext.
2867300	2870300	I saw the whole show.
2870300	2872300	I'm very familiar with it.
2872300	2873300	I'm sorry.
2873300	2874300	I have a degree.
2874300	2875300	I got a degree in it.
2875300	2878300	I thought I was showing you a curveball.
2878300	2879300	No, not at all.
2879300	2880300	Cabaret.
2880300	2881300	I get it.
2881300	2883300	It's a show.
2883300	2885300	How about let's do a little Music Man?
2885300	2886300	Right.
2886300	2887300	Music Man.
2887300	2888300	Robert Preston.
2888300	2889300	Yeah.
2889300	2890300	Like Gary Indiana.
2890300	2892300	Gary Anthony Williams.
2892300	2895300	Gary Anthony Williams.
2895300	2898300	That's a deep cut.
2898300	2901300	Yeah, no, I saw that movie.
2901300	2905300	He keeps telling everybody they're going to have trumpets.
2905300	2909300	But then he's a con artist, and then the lady's like,
2909300	2911300	you ain't got no trumpets.
2911300	2913300	And then he's like, no, I got trumpets for real.
2913300	2916300	And then at the end, he has magic trumpets?
2917300	2918300	They get some real trumpets.
2918300	2919300	The trumpets are fake.
2919300	2920300	They get some real trumpets.
2920300	2921300	They're like dream trumpets?
2921300	2922300	Do you know?
2922300	2923300	Have you seen?
2923300	2924300	I haven't seen it in a long time.
2924300	2925300	They get real trumpets, and they come in,
2925300	2927300	but he doesn't know how to teach music.
2927300	2929300	But they all know how to play them.
2929300	2931300	No, they don't, because he normally splits town
2931300	2933300	before that with everybody's money,
2933300	2935300	but he falls in love with the librarian.
2935300	2936300	But then in the end, they all come in,
2936300	2937300	and they're like, fuck for it up,
2937300	2938300	and they know how to play.
2938300	2940300	But they all suck, and they're like,
2940300	2942300	and they're all terrible.
2942300	2945300	But the families, the parents of them,
2945300	2947300	they're so proud of their kids
2947300	2950300	for even playing shitty music.
2950300	2952300	Which is kind of a linear progression,
2952300	2954300	because that's exactly what we already understood
2954300	2955300	to be the con,
2955300	2956300	that the parents would be so proud
2956300	2957300	that he would sell them the instruments.
2957300	2958300	No, no, no, no.
2958300	2959300	There's no curvature in that story.
2959300	2961300	Normally, he sells them the instruments,
2961300	2962300	sells them the uniforms,
2962300	2964300	and then fucks off with the money.
2964300	2965300	But he's able to sell them
2965300	2966300	based on the parents' pride
2966300	2968300	and desire for their kids to be special.
2968300	2969300	Yes, but normally he's gone
2969300	2971300	before they find out that he never taught them.
2971300	2972300	And then the end of the...
2972300	2974300	And then the time he sticks around
2974300	2976300	to find out that...
2976300	2978300	That some problems solve themselves
2978300	2981300	as they do in shitty stories.
2981300	2983300	It's like if Godzilla...
2983300	2984300	I was about to fight Mothra
2984300	2986300	and had a heart attack.
2989300	2991300	And the Japanese army was like,
2991300	2994300	look, Godzilla, he ate too much sandwich.
2994300	2995300	Oh, boo.
2995300	2996300	Oh, boo.
2996300	2997300	Wow.
2997300	2998300	What was that happen?
2998300	2999300	What did you think?
2999300	3000300	It was...
3000300	3001300	Oh, come on.
3001300	3002300	Is this climate?
3002300	3003300	Somebody called...
3003300	3005300	Crazy Rich Asians is...
3005300	3006300	That's literally...
3006300	3011300	And you come off with that Charlie Chan bullshit.
3011300	3014300	What the fucking 1979...
3014300	3015300	I'm not a budget...
3015300	3017300	Godzilla and Crazy Rich Asian food.
3017300	3019300	Oh, God.
3019300	3021300	You guys are weak.
3021300	3022300	See, this is interesting,
3022300	3024300	because at least in Japan,
3024300	3026300	don't they literally transpose
3026300	3028300	the L and R syllable?
3028300	3029300	Yeah.
3029300	3031300	I mean, definitely it's still racist,
3031300	3033300	because that's what we make fun of them for.
3033300	3034300	And actually literally write the word Godzilla.
3034300	3035300	Like, that's the use of R.
3035300	3037300	It just seems tricky.
3037300	3039300	I mean, we should definitely avoid it,
3039300	3041300	but I just like...
3041300	3043300	That is what happens.
3043300	3044300	Yeah, but it's like...
3044300	3047300	It's the danger of coming up with rules for racism
3047300	3049300	is that you don't want anybody
3049300	3051300	to think that the goal is to get away
3051300	3053300	with being racist or prove that they're not racist,
3053300	3055300	because you don't want anybody...
3055300	3057300	Somebody asked me in an interview today
3057300	3059300	is so-and-so racist.
3059300	3061300	It was a gotcha question about somebody well known.
3061300	3063300	I was supposed to answer the question.
3063300	3064300	And I said,
3064300	3067300	that's a deeply irresponsible question
3067300	3070300	to ask or answer about anybody right now,
3070300	3072300	because if you...
3072300	3077300	Is the goal to get a not racist card from Monday
3077300	3081300	so that you can be as racist as possible on Wednesday?
3081300	3084300	Like, there is no...
3084300	3086300	You don't want to ask that or answer that.
3086300	3090300	What you want to do is try to maybe figure out
3090300	3092300	how to not be racist tomorrow,
3092300	3094300	which is probably going to change the definition.
3094300	3096300	Right, a lot of sensitivity training and stuff
3096300	3098300	for don't be racist, don't be sexist
3098300	3100300	is more like don't say these words,
3100300	3101300	or that kind of thing.
3101300	3102300	Which makes people go,
3102300	3104300	oh, so how do I get around those words
3104300	3106300	when the whole late motif is like empathy, empathy, empathy?
3106300	3108300	How not to do sexist or racist things,
3108300	3111300	but you're still sexist or racist?
3111300	3113300	Not like you, but like a person.
3113300	3116300	If the movement...
3116300	3117300	Nice save.
3117300	3119300	If the movement was focused on like,
3119300	3121300	it was like, hey, there's people out here,
3121300	3122300	there's people out here.
3122300	3123300	Not like you, like a person.
3123300	3129300	Hey, there's people out here.
3129300	3131300	Like an actual human.
3131300	3134300	Like a person with feelings.
3134300	3137300	One of those words put in my mouth.
3137300	3140300	I just repeated what you said, sweetheart.
3140300	3141300	Okay, fine.
3141300	3142300	Darling.
3142300	3143300	But it's hard to come up with rules,
3143300	3145300	like just treat people like people.
3145300	3146300	Treat them like they were your best friend,
3146300	3147300	and then you're like, well,
3147300	3150300	my best friends and I used to play smear the queer
3150300	3151300	with the ball up as rare.
3151300	3152300	It's like...
3152300	3153300	It's all nuanced.
3153300	3154300	What I'm saying to you is like...
3154300	3155300	Wasn't a great game.
3155300	3156300	Wait.
3156300	3158300	No, it never was satisfying enough for the language.
3158300	3160300	I never heard the ball up the rear part.
3160300	3163300	I don't know.
3163300	3165300	70s Wisconsin.
3165300	3166300	Yeah.
3166300	3167300	Problematized.
3167300	3168300	Yeah.
3168300	3170300	But anyways, but yeah, I know.
3170300	3171300	It's time wears on.
3171300	3172300	It's just like, oh, wait a minute.
3172300	3175300	Like all these rules have to be about like,
3175300	3178300	can we actually worry about hurting each other?
3178300	3180300	Like stopping people saying a word doesn't mean
3180300	3182300	everyone's suddenly not racist or sexist.
3182300	3187300	In fact, it actually teaches people how to exploit certain rules
3187300	3189300	because hackers are all about code.
3189300	3192300	You can talk really well and then not say certain words and stuff
3192300	3195300	and then somebody who doesn't really know the rules or whatever,
3195300	3197300	but they're clearly like a good person
3197300	3199300	who's not racist or sexist or whatever.
3199300	3200300	The first person that might actually...
3200300	3203300	They're not on the real wavelength of like,
3203300	3205300	we're not allowed to say this anymore or something like that.
3205300	3211300	And conversely, the kinds of people who are into rules,
3211300	3216300	i.e. like those are the people that are going to be the first people
3216300	3218300	to like adapt and pick up on shit and go like,
3218300	3220300	oh, so if I say this and don't say that
3220300	3221300	and then I say this and don't say that,
3221300	3223300	and then if you said that and then you said that
3223300	3224300	and then you said that,
3224300	3228300	they're like the kinds of people that have those kinds of brains,
3228300	3231300	they're pretty largely dangerous people.
3231300	3236300	They got that way because they are not focused on empathy.
3236300	3239300	Yeah, they're more concerned with like self-image
3239300	3241300	rather than actually being good to other people.
3241300	3242300	They're just like,
3242300	3245300	I want everyone to think that I'm being good to other people or whatever.
3245300	3246300	I don't know.
3246300	3247300	I don't want to...
3247300	3248300	I'm scared to talk about this stuff too much.
3248300	3250300	No, I don't want to drag you into some more pit
3250300	3251300	where they're like,
3251300	3255300	Dear Harvard Town, you're a friend, Nova.
3255300	3257300	I have a few bones to pick.
3257300	3259300	Nova, what's your last name?
3263300	3264300	Mandel?
3264300	3265300	What?
3265300	3266300	Mandel?
3266300	3267300	Oh, okay.
3267300	3269300	You wanted it to be special.
3269300	3270300	Nova special?
3270300	3271300	Nova special.
3271300	3272300	I don't know.
3272300	3273300	There's like Nova specials, right?
3273300	3274300	I don't know.
3274300	3275300	My name's already Nova.
3275300	3276300	I'm identifiable.
3276300	3278300	If somebody actually knows me or is in my life,
3278300	3280300	they'll be like, that's Nova.
3280300	3281300	They're not going to be like,
3281300	3283300	that's a different John or whatever.
3283300	3286300	It's not like the Mandel gives me away.
3287300	3291300	There's a Nova special that I can never watch
3291300	3295300	because my dogs won't allow me.
3295300	3296300	It's about dogs.
3296300	3297300	They freak out too much.
3297300	3298300	It's the one about dogs.
3298300	3300300	I don't think I've ever seen an episode of Nova,
3300300	3302300	except I remember one time in science class,
3302300	3304300	they were like, let's put on a movie.
3304300	3305300	So they put on Nova.
3305300	3308300	So then it was like the big logo flashed on the screen,
3308300	3310300	Nova, and then like big dramatic music.
3310300	3312300	And everyone was like, yeah.
3312300	3314300	We get to freak out.
3315300	3316300	What did you say?
3316300	3317300	I didn't hear.
3317300	3318300	I didn't hear.
3318300	3319300	It's cool.
3319300	3320300	I love Nova.
3320300	3321300	I watch it all the time.
3321300	3322300	Thanks.
3322300	3323300	Yeah.
3325300	3328300	Yeah, didn't you ask me to talk about how I...
3328300	3330300	I mean, we can talk about anything you want.
3330300	3331300	Moving forward with the show.
3331300	3334300	Well, I think she was going to eulogize John McCain, right?
3334300	3335300	No.
3335300	3340300	Yeah, I just...
3340300	3344300	Yeah, you listened to the show.
3344300	3346300	You know, like, what's my job?
3346300	3348300	What am I supposed to do?
3348300	3351300	I think it's the same from that it's always been.
3351300	3353300	I mean, maybe it's been different in your head,
3353300	3356300	but it's always like kind of seemed the same.
3356300	3358300	Well, you can have a lot of internal things going on,
3358300	3361300	and then we kind of get the same results at the end or whatever.
3361300	3363300	You just, you know, you come out and you talk,
3363300	3365300	and then it's like, it's your show.
3365300	3369300	You have Spencer, and you have Jeff, and now you have Shrob,
3369300	3370300	and...
3371300	3372300	Hey.
3372300	3373300	Can I ask you a question?
3373300	3374300	Okay.
3374300	3376300	When is he doing it right?
3376300	3379300	Well, I don't know.
3379300	3381300	When you're listening to it, you're like,
3381300	3382300	oh, yeah, this is...
3382300	3384300	Well, Harmontown is Harmontown.
3384300	3387300	There's like, if you're talking about your dog door or whatever,
3387300	3390300	I might think it's hilarious, and then somebody else might be like,
3390300	3392300	eh, and then you might be talking about a drink you had,
3392300	3394300	and then someone else might think it's hilarious,
3394300	3396300	and I might be like, eh, but I always love the show,
3396300	3398300	because if I...
3398300	3400300	I don't get people who are like, I hate every episode
3400300	3402300	except these kinds of episodes.
3402300	3404300	I mean, if you're like that, fine, be picky with your stuff,
3404300	3406300	but for me, it's just... No, don't.
3406300	3409300	But for me, it's just like, I love Harmontown,
3409300	3413300	and I probably wouldn't listen to it if I didn't always really like it,
3413300	3415300	and I don't know, I'm really...
3415300	3420300	You talk a lot about how special it was at the meltdown and stuff,
3420300	3423300	and I'm sad that I never got to go there,
3423300	3426300	because I was listening to every single episode through,
3426300	3428300	and I was like, when I catch up, I'll go,
3428300	3430300	and then you guys had lost the Starburns,
3430300	3432300	and what was that?
3432300	3434300	No, that's just so sad.
3434300	3437300	That's sad that there's already a post-meltdown generation.
3437300	3439300	That's just sad.
3439300	3441300	Are you going to stab your parents?
3441300	3444300	Like, it's a whole generation born alone.
3444300	3446300	I'm always going to stab your parents.
3446300	3447300	No.
3447300	3449300	I've always been happy to still listen to the show.
3449300	3451300	Wait, are you sure?
3451300	3453300	Yeah, I'm sure.
3453300	3457300	Are you going to weaponize your tiny Rick and Morty backpack?
3457300	3459300	Fill it with rocks.
3459300	3461300	That could be something.
3461300	3463300	That was too ready an answer.
3463300	3464300	That was.
3464300	3468300	I just saw it and I just thought rocks.
3468300	3471300	I like that you went Stone Age on that, that's fantastic.
3471300	3475300	I don't want to fill with knives or something, just rocks, that's fine.
3475300	3478300	Yeah, I mean, every time I...
3478300	3482300	Sorry, two to the right, there's one to the right.
3482300	3483300	I don't know.
3483300	3487300	I'll just talk about, since I've been coming here and stuff,
3487300	3489300	yeah, I caught up with all the episodes,
3489300	3490300	and I was like, oh, they don't have a theater,
3490300	3492300	and then I kept thinking, please don't end, please don't end,
3492300	3494300	please don't end if they can't find a theater or whatever,
3494300	3496300	and you guys came here and I was so happy,
3496300	3497300	and then every single time I'm like,
3497300	3499300	I hope he's not like I'm going to end the show,
3499300	3501300	I hope he's not like I'm going to end the show.
3501300	3502300	Hope he's not going to what?
3502300	3503300	End the show.
3503300	3504300	End the show.
3504300	3506300	Oh, God, I don't want to hold people hostage with that.
3506300	3507300	That's awful.
3507300	3508300	No.
3508300	3509300	A horrible archetype to be.
3509300	3510300	No, no, no.
3510300	3511300	Maybe you'll end the show.
3511300	3512300	What do you think?
3512300	3513300	No, no, no.
3513300	3514300	I don't feel that way at all.
3514300	3516300	No, I mean, I blow things up in my head,
3516300	3520300	so I hear like one tone and I'm like, oh, is he going to end the show?
3520300	3522300	Well, clearly, I'm participating in that somehow
3522300	3523300	or you wouldn't be saying that.
3523300	3524300	Yeah, no.
3524300	3525300	I mean, I guess.
3525300	3526300	Are you going to end the show, Dan?
3526300	3527300	Let me think about it.
3527300	3529300	Well, I don't know.
3529300	3532300	It depends how many people love me.
3532300	3533300	No, I know.
3533300	3534300	I really don't.
3534300	3535300	That's not my intention.
3535300	3536300	If you clap loud enough, Dan will not end the show.
3536300	3537300	But I mean, every time I...
3537300	3546300	But I mean, almost every single week since you started doing the shows here,
3546300	3549300	I just, I come early, so I'm ahead in line
3549300	3550300	and then I make friends with someone in line
3550300	3552300	and then some people come back like a lot
3552300	3555300	and then we sit next to each other during the show
3555300	3557300	and then, you know, I love the show.
3557300	3559300	After listening to the podcast so long,
3559300	3562300	then coming here, like the first couple of shows,
3562300	3566300	which is like, I get really excited by things.
3566300	3569300	So I was like completely starstruck
3569300	3571300	and now I've calmed down a little bit.
3571300	3572300	Now you're over it for sure.
3572300	3575300	No, I'm not over it, sir.
3575300	3576300	I'm just like...
3576300	3579300	Now you felt the onstage sadness that goes on up here.
3579300	3582300	No, I'm just like, my excitement levels are off the charts.
3582300	3585300	Now I can just actually enjoy the show without this...
3585300	3588300	I kind of get it in the sense of like the podcast that I listen to,
3588300	3591300	some of them I even, like Cody and I talk about
3591300	3594300	like very candidly in a way that I wouldn't...
3594300	3597300	We're hate listening to this podcast.
3597300	3598300	We love this podcast.
3598300	3603300	It's like the lines blur, but the behavior doesn't change,
3603300	3606300	which is something a guy like me would obsess about.
3606300	3609300	Like, wait, am I doing good or bad?
3609300	3610300	You like me or hate me?
3610300	3614300	But it's like a podcast that people are listening to,
3614300	3617300	they're listening to because it's like part of their family
3617300	3623300	and your family, you're like Uncle Henry, like whatever.
3623300	3625300	Like, do I admire him?
3625300	3629300	Do I think I should do what he says or anything?
3629300	3632300	It's just sort of like, no, he's Uncle Henry and he's always there
3632300	3634300	because I listen to these podcasts that are like sort of...
3634300	3638300	If they experiment too much, I actually get mad at them.
3638300	3641300	And I'm kind of like, oh, this guy always does that
3641300	3644300	and then I put it on and I'm like, then they do something different
3644300	3646300	and I'm like, what are you doing? Stop it.
3646300	3649300	Well, I'm not listening for anything other than just the people
3649300	3652300	that are on the show, you and Spencer and Jeff
3652300	3656300	and then whoever else might be here, like Rob or Brandon or whatever.
3660300	3662300	God bless you. God bless you.
3662300	3663300	I don't need it. I don't need it.
3663300	3664300	I don't need whoever else.
3664300	3665300	You're doing a great job.
3665300	3667300	And then like you guys are the three that are here every week
3667300	3669300	and then also there's the five and there's Brandon.
3669300	3670300	We are.
3670300	3672300	This is exactly what Dan wants to hear.
3672300	3673300	You're doing great.
3673300	3675300	No, it's that specific.
3675300	3677300	Do you need a drink or anything?
3677300	3679300	I wish. No.
3681300	3683300	Can I pour you a drink? Are you all right?
3683300	3685300	Do you drink? You don't get high, but do you drink?
3685300	3686300	No, I'm not.
3686300	3687300	Are you driving?
3687300	3689300	Do you pass the popcorn?
3689300	3691300	Don't give him the popcorn.
3691300	3694300	I was going to offer my popcorn because I had about the same amount left.
3694300	3695300	I'm okay. Thank you.
3695300	3697300	No, not again.
3697300	3698300	I don't know.
3698300	3701300	There's not a lot left. Are you sure you want it?
3701300	3703300	Yeah, give it to me.
3703300	3705300	There's not enough left.
3705300	3707300	There's plenty. Look at this.
3709300	3710300	That's the best stuff.
3710300	3711300	Didn't you, Dan?
3711300	3713300	I have to enjoy it really hard out of spite.
3713300	3714300	Yeah.
3714300	3716300	You get that bottom of the popcorn bag tooth breaker shit.
3716300	3718300	That's the saltiest stuff.
3718300	3719300	Yeah.
3719300	3720300	Don't put it on my bag.
3722300	3726300	Would you say though, among your top, if you were to grab a couple words,
3726300	3730300	like an adjective, I present you with a C of adjectives and I say,
3730300	3731300	Nova.
3738300	3741300	Nova, pick your, like, here's a handful of adjectives
3741300	3742300	and you're just grabbing them.
3742300	3743300	Go.
3743300	3750300	I'm like, would you, true or false, like from a Dan Harmon thing,
3750300	3752300	you're like, oh, well, honesty.
3752300	3755300	Like, I want honesty. Dan's going to be honest with me.
3755300	3757300	You're going to grab honesty, right?
3757300	3758300	Transparency.
3759300	3761300	Don't, don't make a sound.
3761300	3766300	I mean, or do because I'm transparent and I'll deal with the fucking hurt
3766300	3769300	that you just inflicted on me in real time.
3769300	3772300	When you're like, because you're such an, you're so honest,
3772300	3777300	that person that they're like, well, if he's honest, if he's a fuck you,
3777300	3784300	I'm going to kill myself and mention you in the note seat three H.
3784300	3787300	You don't even know that's your seat.
3788300	3789300	I used to say that a lot.
3789300	3792300	Like, I'm going to write a suit so you're going to be in it.
3792300	3795300	It's an awesome fucking burn, isn't it?
3795300	3797300	I'll kill myself and mention you in the note.
3797300	3798300	It goes hard.
3798300	3799300	It does not go light.
3799300	3801300	It's fucking like baller.
3801300	3802300	Oh, it's baller.
3802300	3803300	It's like your version of baller.
3803300	3804300	It's your baller.
3804300	3807300	Harmon baller, like, depressive kind of angry baller.
3807300	3809300	Yeah, manic depressive baller.
3809300	3810300	Yeah.
3810300	3812300	But I also don't advocate for...
3812300	3815300	Dan, I got to say, you and Nova, I've just met her,
3815300	3816300	but I've known you for a long time.
3816300	3820300	You guys are both some real manic depressive ballers.
3820300	3821300	Thanks, man.
3821300	3822300	It's true.
3822300	3823300	But anyways...
3823300	3825300	Quentin Crisp said in a suicide note,
3825300	3827300	you should never take anybody with you.
3827300	3829300	You should, like, be classy about it.
3829300	3831300	Like, don't say, like, oh, I blame that person.
3831300	3833300	Like, you leave it alone.
3833300	3834300	I'm trying to figure out...
3834300	3837300	That's why you suicide note writers out there.
3837300	3838300	It's a little suicide note.
3838300	3839300	Look at this joke.
3839300	3840300	Remember that tonight.
3840300	3842300	Some jokes are funny because they go too far.
3842300	3843300	Like, I'm going to put you in my suicide note.
3843300	3844300	But it has to be the time and the place.
3844300	3846300	Like, Harmon Town is the time and the place,
3846300	3847300	because that's the way that the show is.
3847300	3851300	And I have a rich tradition of perfectly blocking the tightrope.
3851300	3852300	I never...
3852300	3853300	Yeah, everyone loves it.
3853300	3854300	I've never faltered.
3854300	3857300	I mean, yeah, with the honesty thing,
3857300	3860300	it's less honesty, specifically that word.
3860300	3862300	The word is more authenticity,
3862300	3865300	like, and, like, genuineness or whatever,
3865300	3867300	of, like, you just come out here and be yourself.
3867300	3869300	You're not like, okay, this is like...
3869300	3870300	I don't know.
3870300	3871300	I've never really...
3871300	3872300	So then if that person is going through a crisis
3872300	3874300	where they're like, who the fuck am I,
3874300	3878300	then it's like things start to get a little bit Brechtian
3878300	3882300	to borrow a phrase that I heard a college student once say.
3882300	3884300	I love Brecht's words.
3884300	3885300	I hardly know what it means.
3885300	3888300	But, you know, like, it's like, oh, shit.
3888300	3890300	Like, where...
3890300	3891300	That's the thing.
3891300	3894300	Like, oh, hey, the podcast is about me
3894300	3896300	figuring out what the podcast is.
3896300	3898300	And then you're like, well, that and 50 Cent's
3898300	3899300	will get me a Snickers.
3900300	3902300	I mean, I've never, like, not listened to an episode
3902300	3904300	because you're in a bad mood, but, like...
3906300	3907300	So I'm dating myself.
3907300	3909300	50 Cent's once bought you a Snickers.
3910300	3913300	That and a handful of shit will fill one hand.
3916300	3918300	I don't understand what that was supposed to...
3918300	3919300	what that dad's point was.
3919300	3920300	I have no idea.
3920300	3921300	I can't even begin to...
3921300	3924300	He was trying to be real mean, I think, was his point.
3924300	3926300	Yeah, he wasn't trying to be smaller.
3926300	3928300	He was just sort of indoctrinating his son
3928300	3930300	into a world of substance.
3930300	3933300	He's saying, like, welcome to the world of substance.
3933300	3934300	I see.
3934300	3936300	Real things are shit.
3936300	3937300	Wishes are...
3937300	3939300	Anything that fills your hand is worth something
3939300	3940300	and that's it.
3940300	3943300	Things that are real are shit.
3943300	3945300	Are you saying that because the guy that owns you
3945300	3949300	has a hand full of something invisible called credit?
3951300	3953300	Don't you work for a fucking corporation
3953300	3954300	that doesn't even have a hand
3954300	3957300	that is already filled with fucking debt?
3957300	3959300	I know, it makes me mad, all that kind of stuff.
3959300	3960300	Fuck dads.
3960300	3961300	Not dads.
3961300	3964300	I mean, yeah, but capitalism and stuff.
3964300	3966300	Fuck capitalism and dads.
3966300	3967300	Fuck capitalism and dads!
3967300	3968300	For the same reason.
3968300	3970300	For the narrow window of capitalism
3970300	3972300	that assures me an exit strategy.
3974300	3977300	It's basically saying don't dream
3977300	3978300	because...
3978300	3980300	What is a wish?
3980300	3983300	I have to go to work this morning.
3983300	3984300	He's kind of saying...
3985300	3988300	Let me try to punch up his...
3989300	3992300	Here's my pitch on what he's saying.
3992300	3995300	Hey son, poop in one hand
3995300	3997300	and wish in the other
3997300	4000300	and tell me which gets you more peanuts.
4001300	4002300	Neither.
4002300	4004300	No, poop has peanuts in it.
4004300	4005300	It's gross, but...
4005300	4006300	Only if you eat peanuts.
4006300	4007300	It doesn't just have peanuts in it.
4007300	4009300	No, poop comes right now.
4009300	4010300	You're right.
4010300	4011300	You're right.
4011300	4013300	I thought you said you didn't watch Nova.
4014300	4015300	Here, eat these peanuts.
4015300	4016300	Hey, I got one.
4016300	4017300	I'm a real nerd man.
4017300	4018300	Eat these peanuts.
4018300	4019300	Hey, I got one.
4019300	4020300	Now shit in your hand.
4021300	4022300	Okay, yeah.
4022300	4024300	Mine requires a certain amount of...
4024300	4025300	You get peanuts.
4025300	4026300	I got one.
4026300	4028300	Shit in one hand.
4028300	4030300	Shit in the other hand.
4032300	4034300	And see all the shit in your hand.
4034300	4035300	Yeah.
4035300	4037300	You could kill them both if on stone, right?
4037300	4039300	And wish you had some soap.
4039300	4041300	And see what happens because you don't.
4041300	4042300	A shit in the hand.
4043300	4044300	Shit.
4044300	4045300	Shit in one hand.
4045300	4047300	Shit in the other hand.
4047300	4049300	Look at the mess you made.
4049300	4054300	Now go to the bathroom and clean up the shit on your hands before we have dinner.
4054300	4055300	That's life.
4055300	4057300	Shit in one hand.
4057300	4059300	Shit in the other hand.
4059300	4062300	Then you'll find out whether you're left or right handed.
4063300	4064300	Which one?
4064300	4065300	You drop faster or something?
4065300	4066300	You always poop in the...
4066300	4070300	Shit in both hands at the same time.
4071300	4073300	Rub them on your feet.
4074300	4076300	Roll around in it.
4077300	4079300	Eat the shit.
4080300	4082300	Wish you didn't do that.
4084300	4086300	And see what happens.
4086300	4088300	And be like, wish for the shit to be gone.
4088300	4090300	See if anything happens, you know?
4090300	4099300	It's weird that the anti-wish lobby is so adamant about fictionalizing their wish.
4099300	4101300	Their metaphor is to drive it home.
4101300	4103300	It's like, aren't you a pragmatist?
4103300	4105300	Just tell me wishes don't mean anything.
4105300	4109300	What's with the narrative, fucking anti-wish man?
4109300	4113300	Hey, why don't you take a wish and put it in a dragon's ass?
4113300	4115300	Like, whoa, hey, what are we, a Narnia here?
4115300	4117300	I thought wishes don't mean anything.
4117300	4119300	I think wishes are worth more than shit.
4119300	4120300	At least in this world.
4120300	4121300	Definitely.
4121300	4125300	I mean, shit is like literal negative value in most situations.
4125300	4126300	Yeah, you gotta wash it off.
4126300	4127300	You're like, I gotta get rid of this.
4127300	4128300	It's a liability.
4128300	4129300	You have work to do.
4129300	4131300	You're like, I gotta get rid of this shit.
4131300	4133300	It's based on classics that actually landed.
4133300	4134300	Like, dad-isms.
4134300	4139300	Like, for instance, my dad would say, you would go, well, if we do this, and they would
4139300	4144300	do that, my dad would say, if my aunt had balls, she'd be my uncle.
4144300	4148300	Or if frogs had wings, they wouldn't bump their ass a-hoppin'.
4148300	4149300	Right.
4149300	4154300	Ifs and butts were dicks and butts.
4154300	4157300	We'd all have a Merry Christmas.
4157300	4159300	Yeah, it turns out, actually, life caught up to dad.
4159300	4160300	If my aunt had balls, she'd be my uncle.
4160300	4165300	Now you could say, actually, dad, let's ask them what pronoun they'd prefer.
4165300	4166300	Yeah, I would actually.
4166300	4170300	A huge thing that I actually really love about the show is that there's been transgender
4170300	4176300	people on stage, because I'm transgender, and there's nowhere to be found.
4176300	4180300	If birds and bees were poos and bees.
4180300	4181300	I was being sincere.
4181300	4182300	The air would smell all stinky.
4182300	4186300	Now I'm embarrassed that I brought it up, because you made a joke.
4186300	4190300	No, you felt vulnerable, and you felt like you assailed your vulnerability.
4190300	4193300	No, I'm glad I'm flattered that you feel comfortable about that.
4193300	4195300	I'm really happy that there's been transgender people on the show.
4195300	4197300	I didn't mean to assail your vulnerability.
4197300	4198300	That's okay.
4198300	4199300	I love that you've talked about it.
4199300	4200300	It's amazing.
4200300	4201300	I am not a person who is...
4201300	4202300	Makes me very happy.
4202300	4205300	I try to police myself being reactive to things.
4205300	4211300	I sense my reactions to things like I'm an old man, and then I see something in the headlines.
4211300	4215300	I have that same instinct that other people have, and you go, well, now this?
4215300	4216300	Oh, brother.
4216300	4217300	Yeah, these bird scooters.
4217300	4218300	Yeah.
4218300	4219300	I feel like an old man, too.
4219300	4223420	I see things like, oh, this new technology, and I'm like, pum, pum, pum, pum, for some
4223420	4224420	new culture.
4224420	4225420	I'm like, why are they doing that?
4225420	4227380	But then I try to go like, well, wait a minute.
4227380	4228380	What are we doing here?
4228380	4232180	Yeah, I try to be like, okay, so what if people are doing something?
4232180	4237140	Either it'll pass, or if it's not a dumb thing, then maybe it'll stick around, and it'll be
4237140	4238140	fine.
4238140	4241860	Hey, have you guys tried the void?
4241860	4242860	The VR experience?
4242860	4244860	The VR thing at the Glendale Gallery?
4245420	4246420	No.
4246420	4247420	Yeah.
4247420	4248420	Levee, where is the...
4248420	4249420	I don't mean to be...
4249420	4250420	Oh, yeah, the ice thing?
4250420	4251420	Yeah.
4251420	4252420	Have you done it?
4252420	4253420	There's only vodka.
4253420	4254420	No melting ice bucket.
4254420	4255420	We'll make it happen over time.
4255420	4256420	Okay.
4256420	4257420	Spencer?
4257420	4258420	Yes.
4258420	4259420	You have done it?
4259420	4260420	Sorry, Levee.
4260420	4261420	No, no.
4261420	4262420	The void.
4262420	4263420	The VR experience.
4263420	4264420	The VR thing.
4264420	4265420	Yeah, I did it.
4265420	4266420	I did it.
4266420	4267420	I don't like sincerity.
4267420	4268420	What?
4268420	4269940	I said, you guys don't like sincerity.
4269940	4272420	He really did do the void.
4272420	4273420	Huh?
4273420	4274620	That's honesty.
4275380	4276380	That's true.
4276380	4277380	You're right.
4277380	4278380	I'm sorry for just...
4278380	4279380	What?
4279380	4280380	You were talking about technology, right?
4280380	4281380	I guess.
4281380	4282380	Okay.
4282380	4283380	In a way.
4283380	4286380	You were saying there's this new technology.
4286380	4289380	I think Nova's implying that the trans thing...
4289380	4290380	Steve Levee, everybody.
4290380	4291380	Steve Levee.
4291380	4292380	Thank you.
4292380	4296380	Now, we don't need to talk about that, though.
4296380	4297380	It's fine.
4297380	4298380	Right.
4298380	4299380	And I think that's...
4299380	4300380	Yeah, they didn't...
4300380	4301380	I just want to say that, because I really...
4301380	4302380	I don't think they were...
4302380	4303380	Steve Levee walking through the aisle.
4303380	4304380	I just want to say that, because I really do appreciate that about you.
4305140	4306140	It makes me really, really happy.
4306140	4307140	Feel free to grudge people.
4307140	4308140	I'm really glad to hear you say that.
4308140	4309140	I honestly...
4309140	4313980	I need to hear that, because I've often in the past...
4313980	4317900	The story of my life is that I just blunder through these minefields, and I'm just like,
4317900	4321340	well, if I just be myself, then everybody will get the message that I don't mean anybody
4321340	4322340	any harm.
4322340	4323340	Yeah, that's kind of how I do things, too.
4323340	4324740	And it gets a little tricky sometimes.
4324740	4325740	Yeah.
4325740	4326740	Yeah, it does.
4326740	4327740	I mean, I definitely...
4327740	4333580	Yeah, I don't mind that you blunder through things or whatever.
4333580	4337580	I'd rather people talk about things than just pretend...
4337580	4340580	I'd rather...
4340580	4341580	So much.
4341580	4342580	I like...
4342580	4346580	No, but you're the best, by the way.
4346580	4347580	Thanks.
4347580	4349580	I love you up here.
4349580	4350580	Thanks.
4350580	4354980	Yeah, I'd rather people talk about things than ignore them, because they're...
4354980	4358860	And try to pretend they don't exist, because they're afraid of messing something up.
4358860	4362940	I'd rather you kind of address it, even if you blunder, quote-unquote, but that's just
4362940	4363940	me.
4363940	4366460	A lot of people kind of in my circles kind of don't feel that way.
4366460	4368500	They're like, if you say a wrong word, fuck you, you know?
4368500	4369500	And I'm like...
4369500	4375020	And I understand that stuff, too, because I understand, I mean, look, the last two years
4375020	4379540	in particular has been a fucking crazy roller coaster ride for even my archetypes.
4379540	4385860	So even before that shit, you might have watched me going up and down and learning about, oh,
4385860	4388660	how do I address this, and what language do I use here?
4388660	4393940	And then election happens, and it's like, oh, now I'm learning what it's actually like
4393940	4399260	to feel like you're isolated and that you have no control, and it's like, welcome to
4399260	4403220	the party.
4403220	4404220	It's very interesting.
4404220	4411020	I can't remember what my point was, I'm probably too drunk, but I do appreciate that, because
4411020	4415780	I'm trying to listen to books now on tape that are called, getting over your addiction
4415780	4424540	to approval, like now at this point in this twilight of my life, like my whole thing.
4424540	4428980	Like Sidebar, Harman Town.
4428980	4430860	My thing has to be about...
4430860	4438220	That's my ironic job, is I have this tank of shame that it's nobody else's fault that
4438220	4443500	it's there, and it has nothing to do with whether or not I've paid more dues than anybody
4443500	4444500	else.
4444500	4452580	I have this crazy battery filled with shame, and if somebody says, pass the salt, there's
4452580	4458380	a 20% higher chance that I'll figure out a way to turn it into, you didn't pass the salt
4458380	4463340	earlier, you piece of shit, it's just weird shit like that.
4463340	4467900	I got this fucking bucket of shame driving me.
4467900	4473140	And so that makes it in particular, it's like, oh, what's with this approval addiction?
4473140	4477480	Because if you're going to try to get people's approval, then you're going to run into situations
4477480	4482260	where people are going to say, actually, I'll take a pass on that, you didn't get my approval.
4482260	4486060	And if that's going to make you fly into a rage, maybe you shouldn't be in the approval
4486060	4488660	game, or maybe you should lose the shame, et cetera.
4488660	4493700	So I'm listening to all these fucking books on tape that are like, hey, don't care what
4493700	4496820	people think, but at the same time, it's...
4496820	4497820	How does that help?
4497820	4501220	Yeah, I mean, it's a turbulent mess.
4501220	4504700	And so because it's a turbulent mess, I think that's the good news about it, is that actually
4504700	4512180	we could actually all call out to each other over a whirlpool, like actually a quality
4512180	4513180	achieved.
4513180	4518340	If it gets that chaotic, we can all be like, I can't tell the difference between anybody
4518340	4519620	right now.
4519620	4528140	I'm pretty sure it's just us versus a whirlpool, like who doesn't want to drown, say yay.
4528140	4529460	And everyone goes, yay.
4529460	4534460	And anybody that says, I do want to drown, it's like, all right, it sounds like you're
4534460	4537940	in pain, because why should you want to drown?
4537940	4542020	And anybody that's like, you should drown, I'm not drowning, it's like, okay, you fucking
4542020	4545060	diluted Nazi.
4545060	4548340	But even then, for agreement says, that guy's made of light.
4548340	4552460	I don't know why everyone got on you so hard for that.
4552460	4553460	I'm going to figure it all out.
4553460	4558100	If you guys leave here with one thing tonight, is that Nazis are made of light.
4559100	4562100	I refuse that to be the title of the show, I will not.
4564100	4567100	Are you saying we shouldn't call it Nazis are made of light?
4567100	4571380	Yeah, I mean, I definitely get the approval thing and the built-in shame thing of, I'll
4571380	4574980	totally apologetically be myself all the time, but if anybody calls me on anything, I'll
4574980	4579100	be like, you're right, I'm a piece of shit, why'd you pass the salt?
4579100	4582660	I'm like, hey, it's totally cool, however, it passed the salt is fine, it's all good.
4582660	4585860	And then if anybody were to be like, why'd you pass the salt like that?
4585860	4588380	Even if it wasn't super mean, I'd just be like, you're right, I'm a piece of shit,
4588380	4589380	I didn't pass it right.
4589380	4592620	I need to figure out exactly how to pass it right, otherwise, like, I'm a garbage person.
4592620	4599140	You know, I'm really cool with people asking me to pass the salt.
4599140	4600140	That's nice for you.
4600140	4609860	If they want the salt, and it's on my side of the table, I could stop for two seconds,
4609860	4615740	two microns, and pass the salt over to somebody.
4615740	4618500	Maybe I've been using it, maybe I've been bogarting the salt.
4618500	4619900	God damn it, he finally wins.
4619900	4622620	I've known this guy for 80 years.
4622620	4624660	Feels like it.
4624660	4628060	I met him in Amber, that's how old we are.
4628060	4629060	In where?
4629060	4632780	Amber, like, it's just resin.
4632780	4638020	We were both on top of a brontosaurus, and I was like, hello, and he was like, hi, and
4638020	4640780	then we got bored out and shipped here.
4640780	4641780	Yeah.
4641780	4642780	We're a thousand years old.
4642820	4645900	Yeah, I had a friend for like six years, which is a long time when you're like a teenager
4645900	4649020	or whatever, and it's like, yeah, by the end, we just like hate each other and stuff, you
4649020	4650020	know?
4650020	4651020	It's like, all right, he's still my best friend.
4651020	4652020	I don't know.
4652020	4654020	Yeah, the closest people and all that shit.
4654020	4655020	Yeah.
4655020	4657020	Uncle Moody's a piece of shit.
4657020	4661380	But you know, it's kind of like, you know, the thing I'm like, I'm listening to the self
4661380	4665700	esteem book, and the thing that blew my mind that actually really challenged me, because
4665700	4670060	I was like, fuck, they took that away from me too, is self loathing.
4670060	4673260	It's like, it's another fucking dodge.
4673260	4674260	That's the thing.
4674260	4679900	I just realized that the other day, I was in my shower, and I had to get out of the
4679900	4680900	shower.
4680900	4685380	Well, it's just another way of giving in to yourself, critic, and you're basically doing
4685380	4686380	it.
4686380	4687380	It's a dodge.
4687380	4688380	It's like a check kiting scheme.
4688380	4689380	It's an excuse.
4689380	4690380	Yes.
4690380	4694340	If you were to say to me, like, oh, you said some transphobic shit in the last podcast,
4694340	4699420	and if I were to go, yeah, I'm a piece of fucking shit, and I'm so fucking transphobic,
4699420	4700420	what the fuck is wrong with you?
4700420	4703860	Yeah, then you're like, that's not an apology or anything like that.
4703860	4708620	Yeah, I'm actually turning it on you, and also I'm just avoiding everything.
4708620	4709620	Well, I do that too.
4709620	4710620	You turn into the victim.
4710620	4712100	You're like, oh, I feel bad, you know?
4712100	4715740	So I don't know, when I was a kid, if anyone ever accused me of like, oh, you were mean
4715740	4719580	to this person, which I never was, it was just like, if someone misinterpreted something
4719580	4725340	I said or something, and I would just immediately just burst into tears, and it was legitimate.
4725340	4727820	I wasn't faking it of like, oh, what was me?
4727820	4730300	But maybe like unconsciously I was, I don't know.
4730300	4735500	Well, it fucking hurts to think that people don't like you, it fucking hurts, the worst
4735500	4736500	thing that could ever happen.
4736500	4737500	Yeah, absolutely.
4737500	4741580	Like, you could hit me in the face with a two by four, I would take that over, like,
4741580	4745100	when I was on the playground, and people would punch me, like, the thing that would make
4745100	4750500	me cry would be somebody coming up and sticking up for me and going like, hey, leave him alone.
4750500	4755380	And then I would start crying, because I'd be like, oh, I'm like, causing everybody like...
4755620	4758580	Oh, like, you're like making people like have to pay attention to you or something?
4758580	4761380	Like this poor fucking cool guy now has to take time out of his day?
4761380	4763380	Oh, that's me.
4763380	4768020	I'm fine with this piece of shit, like, fucking hit me harder, like, it only makes me stronger,
4768020	4771780	like, man, are this fucking cool dude's got to come up like fucking Ponyboy, and...
4773780	4777140	Yeah, like, it doesn't even have to be like people liking you, it's just like approval.
4777140	4781300	Then I would burst into tears, I'd be like, no fucking way, like, don't just stick up for me.
4781300	4782820	You went to school with Ralph Macchio?
4782820	4784420	Wow.
4784580	4787060	I mean, it was 83 every... Yes, we all did.
4787060	4787860	Okay.
4787860	4790020	You said you looked like Ralph Macchio as a kid, right?
4790020	4791540	Spencer, what was your shower epiphany?
4792260	4797700	Just what Dan was saying, like, self-hatred is like just an excuse to not really...
4797700	4804980	Like, it's a stopping point, because you're like, oh, should I go exercising?
4804980	4806980	No, I hate myself, I don't have to do that.
4806980	4811060	But it's like, well, no, you thought of the exercising because that's something probably
4811060	4814580	important that you should do, and you shouldn't just stop thinking about it by
4814580	4816500	shortcutting it with I hate myself.
4816500	4819620	And yeah, so I think that's what he was getting at, it's a dodge.
4819620	4822020	Anything you're kind of focusing on yourself, you're basically
4822020	4826420	shutting down those avenues that were going to be frustrating, which is connection,
4826420	4829780	where you might be accountable, you might have to do the awkward, painful thing of,
4829780	4833700	like, not being a hero or a villain and just saying to somebody, oh, did I...
4834580	4835620	Yeah, that's hard.
4835620	4840420	Like, just regular person that maybe is or isn't high maintenance,
4840740	4845460	maybe should or shouldn't be my friend, isn't a hero or a villain, but just is saying,
4845460	4850580	I'd prefer it if you gave me Splenda instead of sweet and low.
4850580	4856020	Like, the tendency to go, like, fuck this bitch, like, fuck this shit, like,
4856020	4859540	fuck people until I'm gonna give as much as I take, and or is going like,
4859540	4861700	yeah, I'm a piece of shit, I can't do anything right.
4861700	4864660	Both of those are the same, they're alternatives to just going like,
4864660	4866180	okay, cool, so Splenda next time.
4866180	4867940	But also sometimes self-loathing feels...
4868100	4873380	But also sometimes the self-loathing as opposed to turning it out on other people
4873380	4875780	can feel safer because you feel like you're not hurting anyone.
4875780	4877300	No, and you're holding the hostage.
4877300	4878020	You feel like, if I'm suffering, that's fine.
4878020	4880820	That's like classic fucked up shit where you're like, I mean, you're like,
4880820	4883460	like, no offense to people who actually have to do English shit.
4883460	4886900	I'm saying, like, we know this manifestation, like, people are like,
4886900	4890660	I'm gonna fucking cut myself until you call me back and all that shit.
4890660	4896260	Like, that's an instinct that humans have, like, because it'll give you a dopamine spike
4896900	4898020	back to that comfort place.
4898020	4898500	What?
4899620	4900820	Did you, what did you just say?
4902020	4903860	Villain, we found a villain.
4903860	4904740	Now I'm comfortable.
4904740	4905860	No, stop, please.
4905860	4907620	He said, he said we're boring.
4907620	4908260	No, I didn't.
4908260	4910180	He said, no, it's not.
4910180	4911460	I said it doesn't work.
4911460	4912100	It doesn't work.
4912100	4913060	Oh, okay.
4913060	4914580	Well, we agree with that, so it's fine.
4914580	4916580	Well, look the other way while I dry my eyes.
4916580	4920980	And I'm comfortable in this awesome chair.
4922100	4923620	That I got for you.
4923620	4924500	You're welcome, you piece of shit.
4924820	4926020	I haven't stopped smiling.
4927700	4929780	Yeah, I mean, maybe that's why I love Harman Tons so much,
4929780	4931780	because I see so much of myself in you and stuff.
4931780	4934100	And also, like, you're in your 40s, so I'm like, okay, cool.
4934100	4934820	Like, you know, I can make it.
4934820	4937060	If that's the worst that could happen, yeah, you're like, you're like...
4939060	4939780	I'm not kidding.
4939780	4941540	I mean, I would like to think that, honestly.
4941540	4942260	I guess I would like...
4942260	4943300	No, I think that's true.
4943300	4946340	Yeah, you know, like, honestly, the worst it gets is, like...
4947220	4948660	Yeah, like, if I could be Harman, that's okay.
4948660	4952580	I could still be, like, fumbling around at 45 and, like, it's cool.
4952900	4954740	That is, like, that's what I want to hear.
4955540	4956500	Yeah, I don't know.
4956500	4959620	I don't pay a lot of attention to stuff made by people like my age,
4959620	4961060	because I'm like, well, what do you have to offer me?
4962580	4964180	Oh, more and more every year.
4965940	4967940	Yeah, yeah, I don't know.
4967940	4969300	That was a glib, I guess.
4969300	4971700	Any fantasy requests as far as, like, segments?
4971700	4976420	Like, if you could just fantasize about, like, you're listening to it,
4976580	4980100	you're... I can't remember what you said you were...
4981540	4982580	What your ideal...
4982580	4984660	Sims? Is that...
4984660	4986820	Oh, yeah, you're playing Sims and you're listening to podcasts.
4986820	4991940	So, any, like, you're like, God, I wish they would do, like, a top 10 list or just any kind of...
4991940	4995940	My favorite parts of all time of the show are when...
4995940	4997140	This is not a fantasy thing.
4997140	4998180	This happens constantly.
4998180	5001060	My favorite part of any episode is when you come...
5001060	5001620	The D&D.
5007300	5008740	Sorry, sorry, I cut you off.
5008740	5010660	Yeah. What were you gonna say, Nova?
5013060	5016260	Is the beginning when you come out and you have funny stories from your life of, like,
5016260	5019460	something weird happened with a dog door or even just someone ran into my garage,
5019460	5022260	because I'm very lonely and pathetic and it feels like I have a friend, you know,
5022260	5026980	who's, like, telling me about something that I actually am not bored by and, you know,
5026980	5031620	or it's funny or, like, the, you know, people beat the little light at the, you know, whatever.
5031620	5032260	Yeah.
5032260	5032660	Yeah.
5032660	5036580	And it probably feels good, I would imagine, I hope, to know that, like, oh,
5037300	5042100	if I fantasize about slowly getting richer and richer, that I realize that that actually
5042100	5048180	just constricts your life experience down to this, like, dilated, like, Harmon just keeps talking
5048180	5055700	about how his toilet works. It kind of, like, I guess I have more flower petals when I'm 25.
5055700	5058740	I don't know if that segment of the show has a bigger meaning for me.
5058740	5060340	That's, like, the funniest part of the show for me at least.
5060340	5064500	I always think about, I just go, like, well, what is comedy? It's, like, you're supposed
5064500	5069540	to be drawing from living your life and then I just think about, like, the only person that's
5069540	5074420	nailed it so far is Larry David because he migrated to HBO and then was, like, literally,
5074420	5082020	like, this is a show about me arguing with my gardener. But you think, like, that is genuinely
5082020	5090100	the progression. Like, if you are successful at getting people to laugh, like, you are rewarded
5090100	5097140	in our glorious society to a level where you're, like, I no longer, like, you don't have, I,
5097140	5102020	the top of this podcast is I would come out and I would go, like, I'm so sick of people telling
5102020	5107700	me to tie my shoes. You said that a lot. Like, I, that, that would be a such a dishonest thing
5107700	5112420	right now. I would come out, I would have to come out now and say, I'm so sick of the guilt that
5112420	5116500	comes with knowing that everyone's afraid to tell me anything about my shoes or else they'll get
5116500	5122500	fired. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, you self advocate enough and then you're, like, relatable and it's
5122500	5126580	also a little uncomfortable and it doesn't, it's, like, there's a little bit of a loop there.
5127220	5133220	But it's honest. Well, it's also where I wanted to be. So, like, you know, but also, like, like,
5133220	5137540	who, yeah, like. Yeah, I do get that about comedy for sure. Like, I talk about, like, acting, like,
5137540	5141380	I don't need to be famous and that's what I know I like, but I fantasized a lot about maybe enjoying
5141380	5146020	being a stand-up comic or making, like, a sitcom or something where, like, I create the characters
5146020	5150980	and then I can express darker things, you know? Like, I can kind of express less savory things
5150980	5156100	because it's funny, you know? Like, I don't have to, I don't, yeah. Let me give you a choice between,
5156100	5161700	and, but without, like, if you, because I think, like, like, as far as, like, guests that we would
5161700	5168820	book, do you, like, in terms of categories, like, your favorite, like, screenwriters, like, like,
5168820	5179700	people that do what I do, me talking to them, anti-fascist activists who feel the way I feel
5179700	5186740	about, about not going gently into this fucking horrible night, at the risk of depressing all of
5186740	5194500	us, and also offending, like, the 30 percent of us who are more than welcome here, the, and then,
5194660	5195540	30 percent.
5198260	5199300	Oh my god.
5201300	5206900	Look, my math is notoriously wrong, but I still got a weird feeling it's gonna turn out to be right.
5207300	5211940	Um, but, but, uh, and then, I don't know what, there's a third category you could,
5211940	5215300	you could make it up, but, like, like, I can't, like, like, should I, I should just have-
5215300	5216660	Trash delivery.
5217860	5223540	Or, or, or, like, Paul, you're, you're too young, you remember, Paul of Poundstone had a show on,
5224020	5228420	show Tyra HBO or something, and she would just have, like, literally, like, a firefighter,
5228420	5232260	or a, like, meter maid, or something, like, like, like, like, she would just, like, it was sort of,
5232260	5234340	like, these are the people in your neighborhood, kind of, like-
5234340	5237540	Like, we went, like, when we had the guy who, like, worked at Target, and, like, knew about all the
5237540	5239700	Targets and stuff, like, he knew all the insider stuff.
5241300	5242420	Well, I probably don't remember that.
5242420	5243380	Maybe it was just, like, from the audience.
5243380	5244740	It was, like, Scoota or something.
5244740	5245860	Scoota, yeah, that was Scoota.
5246980	5248260	Let's get Scoota back, huh?
5249220	5250180	That guy was hot.
5250180	5253300	I know, I wish there were, like, there's, like, no, there's, like, hardly anybody here.
5253700	5255940	Let's get him a line of Scoota, and he can Scoota back over.
5257300	5258580	That was good, that was good.
5258580	5260020	I don't know why that didn't get the response.
5260020	5261780	The third category would be, like, like, like-
5261780	5263220	No, that's, that's honesty.
5263220	5266820	My callbacks are so fucking rich and dense that people really can't even-
5266820	5268660	You're too smart for the room, Jeff.
5268660	5269220	Oh, yeah.
5270100	5270740	Oh, yeah.
5270740	5273860	Because I could go, I could go, I could say, let's book Edward Neumeyer.
5273860	5274900	He wrote Robocop.
5274900	5277700	Let's book, like, I just go, like, all the screenwriters, you know?
5277700	5280340	Like, I would just want to reach out to all the screenwriters, but then,
5280500	5285300	is my show just, like, Elvis Mitchell, like, like, I'm just talking, well,
5285300	5289540	page 10 of Robocop, you chose to do this, you know, like, I don't know.
5289540	5293300	Let's get people that are way too, like, fancy for us,
5293300	5295460	but they have to do yoga with Dave Klein.
5296420	5296980	Let's get Elvis Mitchell.
5296980	5298820	Oh, yeah, I was one of the people who came up and did that.
5298820	5299460	That was weird.
5299460	5300260	That was awesome.
5300260	5301460	That was amazing.
5301460	5302260	It was wild.
5302980	5303460	That was wild.
5303460	5304420	That's exactly the word I would use.
5304420	5304900	Oh, yeah.
5305860	5307140	You're telling me.
5307140	5308260	Should we try a little D&D?
5308420	5311620	Yeah, I mean, let's let Nova plug her album.
5311620	5311860	Yeah.
5311860	5315620	Nova, what's your new record that comes out?
5316260	5317700	Oh, sorry, but what is your pronoun?
5317700	5321300	Sorry, I keep referring to you as her, and you said you were a chance.
5321300	5323060	I don't know.
5323060	5325300	It's, you're up in the air.
5325300	5329940	If I had my wish, I would use they, but a lot of people don't want to use they.
5329940	5331940	It's, well, we're catching up.
5331940	5334180	It's, like, it's gonna, it might take a little time.
5334180	5336420	They're, yeah.
5338260	5339060	He is good, too.
5341220	5341860	They're all fine.
5342420	5342740	Awesome.
5343700	5345860	What's the, what's the, what do you want to do?
5345860	5348580	You want to deliver any parting?
5350500	5353940	Look this up, go to this, go to that, donate to this, like anything.
5353940	5354740	This is your chance.
5354740	5355860	Hey, catch me on Tumblr.
5358020	5360900	That's the only thing I do that's visible to any other people.
5360900	5363620	Have you seen my post, my post about almond milk?
5364500	5365620	No, do you have a Tumblr?
5365620	5368180	Some people talk about my post about almond milk.
5368180	5369140	I don't like almond milk.
5369140	5370020	I don't like it either.
5370020	5371140	You might enjoy my post.
5372420	5374180	I can't stop talking about your almond milk.
5374180	5375060	I would enjoy that post.
5375060	5375780	It's not sweet.
5375780	5376580	Yeah, you should find it.
5376580	5377300	Well, they're sweet, but that's not good either.
5377300	5380340	I mean, don't search it out, but if you see it, it has a lot of notes.
5380340	5381220	Are you on Tumblr?
5381220	5382180	I was, yeah.
5382180	5383140	Oh, not anymore.
5383140	5383860	Not actively.
5383860	5384260	Yeah.
5384260	5384980	Sorry.
5384980	5386020	I like almond milk.
5386740	5386980	Yeah.
5387780	5388420	Well, that's nice.
5389700	5390660	That's fine.
5390660	5391940	All right, let's give it up for Nova, everybody.
5391940	5392660	Thank you so much.
5392660	5395540	Nova, thanks for joining us up here.
5395540	5395940	Thank you.
5398180	5409940	Thanks so much.
5409940	5410180	Dan.
5410180	5410980	That was fun, huh?
5410980	5412180	Yeah.
5412180	5412500	Dan.
5414420	5417860	Dan, that was very emotional.
5418580	5419460	Very sensitive.
5419460	5420660	Don't fucking mock me.
5420660	5421620	No, you were very...
5422180	5423380	Don't you ever...
5423380	5424820	I haven't seen in a while.
5424820	5427460	You know, whatever, anything that happened of value,
5428260	5429700	between me and this guest...
5429700	5430660	I enjoyed it.
5430660	5432260	It was in spite of you.
5432260	5434340	Why? Why? Why?
5434340	5437380	And you have no right now to patronize.
5437380	5437860	I'm not.
5437860	5439700	And I mean, just...
5440660	5442500	I'm trying to give you a compliment.
5442500	5443860	I'm saying you did a great job.
5443860	5446020	I hear your dog whistle blowing.
5447140	5449860	I hear your dog whistle blowing.
5449860	5450660	Hey, Dan.
5450660	5451620	I hear your...
5451620	5453700	I feel your bellow call.
5453700	5454180	Dan, come on.
5454180	5457300	I hear your dog whistle blowing.
5457300	5459380	You always do this song when I'm trying to get serious.
5460660	5462260	This fake Johnny Cash song.
5463300	5465940	You always do this Ersatz Johnny Cash needle drop
5465940	5467220	that you don't have to pay for.
5467220	5468020	Yeah.
5468020	5471620	I hear that dog whistle blowing.
5471620	5473540	I want to hear all of this song.
5473540	5476580	What happened to you over the weekend that you were...
5476580	5484420	Because the rim of my cup has a cup full of bullets
5484420	5486660	and the prison's what's up.
5488580	5490580	I'm Johnny Cash.
5491380	5492660	I'm going round.
5494100	5497620	I've never felt this forest found.
5498900	5505380	I'd ate a million redwood trees and drove a Chevy to the dam.
5505380	5511140	And I spent a night in prison and I ate your mama's ham.
5511140	5514740	I'm Johnny Cash.
5515780	5517300	I was in prison.
5518660	5521140	I'm Johnny Cash.
5521140	5522580	I invented the prism.
5524100	5530660	I was there when Isaac Newton's apple fell on top of his tawny head.
5530660	5539140	And I took him to Folsom prison and I had sex with his head.
5539620	5547220	Because when you're tough, you sing.
5549780	5554420	Country western, high security wing.
5554980	5561300	Johnny Cash, ring of fire, potato man, tire wire.
5561300	5565620	I'm eating that redwood tree and I'm free.
5566260	5567220	Johnny Cash.
5569700	5573620	Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm only entertaining myself.
5573620	5576340	Let's bring up Steve Levy in place of D&D in the back.
5576340	5577460	Levy, are you out there?
5579540	5580260	Are you amongst...
5580980	5584580	Every time I try to take it to a serious place, you got to sing that song.
5585780	5586820	Steve Levy to the stage.
5586820	5587940	Here he is, everybody.
5587940	5588420	Hell yeah.
5590260	5593700	I like to sing from the heart.
5595380	5596900	That's the laziest handshake.
5596900	5598260	Hey, come to me.
5598260	5599060	Shake my hand.
5599700	5600740	Shake the dome.
5600740	5601620	Put it down.
5601620	5603140	So, our time is short, Spencer.
5603140	5604020	I'm sorry to...
5604020	5605140	Wait, Spencer is a thing.
5605140	5606420	Don't you have a thing, Spencer?
5606420	5608420	I got way too many things.
5608980	5610260	Holy shit, you guys.
5610260	5610980	I got things.
5611540	5616660	First of all, Dan, Nova said the favorite part of the show was when,
5616660	5618260	at the beginning, when you're telling the stories,
5618260	5619700	did you clock that as like,
5619700	5622020	oh yeah, when I have all this great stuff prepared,
5622020	5622980	that's when you enjoy it?
5623780	5624980	Nah, because I never like...
5625940	5629140	I never flattered myself was thinking that that's when the...
5629140	5631060	Oh, that's the stuff, baby.
5631060	5631860	Oh, it's great.
5632820	5634100	We heard it from the source.
5635300	5636340	Well, that seems like a...
5636340	5638660	Yeah, I mean, like, oh, my favorite part of the broccoli
5638660	5640820	is the pat of butter on top of it.
5640820	5641460	Yeah.
5641460	5642500	Well, tough titties.
5644100	5644900	It's broccoli.
5645780	5646740	Yeah, I know, but I...
5646740	5647940	Yeah, they...
5647940	5648420	Sure, that'd be my favorite part.
5648420	5649380	I just wanted to ask.
5649380	5650340	I'd forget behind stage.
5650340	5652980	Is that like a subtle note from you that you're like,
5652980	5654340	I wish you prepared more?
5654420	5655380	That was what I...
5655380	5657620	That was what my interpretation and I was like,
5657620	5658900	well, Dan hates himself too.
5658900	5660740	I wonder if that was his interpretation.
5660740	5663780	Yeah, but you don't want to put more anxiety on me
5663780	5665140	about preparing for the show.
5665140	5667140	No, you don't have to do any of that.
5667140	5670500	I wanted to, if you felt that way, tell you not to.
5672100	5673380	But look what I've done instead.
5675060	5676820	I feel like you're flipping the script on me
5676820	5678740	where you're like, yeah, your D&D
5678740	5681700	is your whole fucking shitty show that precedes my D&D.
5681700	5683620	How would you like it if everyone was relying
5683620	5685620	on you to prepare stuff and you were unprepared?
5685620	5687620	No, no, that was not my intent.
5688180	5691460	I see how obvious it is to see now that that's how it reads.
5692340	5694740	This is all, this is like last week all over again.
5694740	5698260	We have to learn to have empathy
5698260	5700020	or we're never going to communicate with each other.
5700020	5701780	Yeah, man, it's rough out there.
5701780	5702580	Look what I just did.
5702580	5703940	I just did the thing that we were talking about
5703940	5705940	where I'm like, oh, you hate me because I do this.
5705940	5707620	And I'm doing that because I'm not communicating.
5707620	5708500	I do that too.
5708500	5708980	It's great.
5709700	5710820	We're working through it together.
5710820	5712980	You're a good friend and you've been my friend forever.
5713060	5714980	And like, you're great.
5714980	5717620	We're going to do it tonight.
5717620	5718980	That's more awkward to say that.
5718980	5719620	No, it's cool.
5719620	5720660	I appreciate you saying that.
5720660	5721860	I feel the same way.
5721860	5723380	And Rob's good too.
5723380	5724500	And Rob's all right.
5724500	5726180	He has his moments, but Jesus Christ.
5726180	5727700	Tonight has featured none of them.
5727700	5728340	So that was...
5730180	5731300	No, you had some moments.
5732500	5733540	That was thing one.
5733540	5739140	Thing two is in my news update, my dad has a VCR now.
5739220	5739700	Whoa.
5740500	5747380	He got a VCR from a Harmentown fan named Alejandro who lives in the area.
5747380	5753060	And he hooked my dad up with a VCR and he's going to watch the VHS tapes he has
5753060	5755060	and see if it's among them.
5755060	5756260	The Goonies thing.
5756260	5757700	The Goonies commercial.
5757700	5761140	Yeah, we're not sure he has it, but we will find out soon.
5761140	5764500	Will you explain to the people who haven't heard the other episode,
5764500	5765620	what we're talking about?
5765700	5770180	So when I was a kid, I was maybe in a Goonies commercial that my dad shot
5770180	5774820	and he put it on local cable TV or something.
5774820	5776020	And it might exist.
5776020	5778020	And everyone but me thought that was cool.
5778020	5783860	So I'm going to melt if I ever see that.
5784900	5786580	It's sure to be a letdown.
5786580	5787620	There's no way it's not.
5789460	5790660	No, I'm glad if you like it.
5790660	5791300	That'll be good.
5791300	5795060	I think just seeing you as a kid is good enough.
5795060	5795780	Sure.
5795780	5796900	I got a beard and everything.
5798580	5799220	All right, Spencer.
5799220	5800260	It's been a thousand years.
5800260	5801540	So I have one more thing.
5801540	5803620	Oh, you got your you got your chest of magic.
5803620	5808340	I actually I don't want to alarm anybody, but I actually started another podcast.
5808340	5811140	It's about being a dungeon master and I'm giving advice.
5811140	5814020	I saw that shit in the most awkward way possible.
5814740	5816020	Yeah, Instagram.
5816020	5816420	Yeah.
5816420	5817380	Browsing, right?
5819220	5820260	It's just D&D.
5820260	5822020	It's just it's just DMing.
5822020	5823460	It's not comedy.
5823460	5824820	It's not funny.
5824820	5826340	It's not entertaining.
5826340	5828100	It's like going to class.
5828100	5828980	It's studying.
5829620	5830580	It's not good.
5830580	5832420	It's where you talk shit about us.
5832420	5832580	Yeah.
5833620	5838420	So you can you can hear me talking about six or seven episodes in when I'm sure Dan hasn't
5838420	5839300	listened to anything.
5839300	5839860	Right.
5839860	5840740	All right, Spencer.
5840740	5843540	I'm going through my second level druid spells and I'm going to fucking
5843540	5845060	lay some fucking heavy shit on you.
5845060	5845540	Okay.
5845540	5850580	I'm I guarantee you, I'm going to chill metal on this one.
5850580	5851540	Called master manual.
5851540	5852180	You can check it out.
5852820	5854100	Yeah, I was just going to say.
5854100	5856420	I'm also on another master manual.
5856420	5857780	Not on Starburn's audio.
5858340	5860580	Well, you know, they can court us.
5864420	5865700	I'm not opposed to it.
5865700	5866580	Make an offer.
5866580	5868740	I'm I'm on.
5871460	5872260	You know what I'm saying?
5872900	5874580	I know exactly what you're saying.
5876580	5878660	And I don't predict you'll be coming over.
5879940	5881460	That's a self-deprecating statement.
5881460	5881860	Sure.
5881860	5882100	Yeah.
5882100	5883300	I mean, I'm open to it.
5883380	5885220	I think you should hold yourself to a higher standard.
5885220	5886820	Well, I hold myself to a higher standard.
5888420	5889380	I'm on a podcast.
5889380	5890420	Another D&D podcast.
5890420	5890820	Oh, yeah.
5890820	5891540	Fear initiative.
5891540	5893060	Fear initiative on the bum house.
5893060	5893780	What the fuck?
5893780	5896660	You know, hey, you snooze, you lose.
5896660	5897300	Suck my dick.
5897300	5897860	Let's play.
5904260	5907300	And they're so nice to me over there.
5907300	5909060	They're so nice.
5909060	5909940	I walk in.
5909940	5911780	I go, Rob, how you doing?
5912420	5914100	What did you do this weekend?
5914100	5914980	That's nice.
5914980	5916900	How did you what are your dreams?
5916900	5919700	What do you what did you what are your interests?
5919700	5921220	That's really cool.
5921220	5921780	Wow.
5921780	5922500	All right, Spencer.
5924100	5925620	Catches all up because it's been a thousand.
5925620	5926340	Wait, Spencer.
5926340	5927780	Isn't there a thing that you wanted to play?
5927780	5929140	What the what are you talking about?
5929140	5930420	I thought there's a video clip.
5930420	5931620	Oh, yeah, that'll be later.
5931620	5932420	Oh, OK, cool.
5932420	5933940	I got a video clip.
5933940	5936100	I knew I didn't know what you're talking about.
5936100	5936900	Yeah.
5936900	5938420	Speaking of preparedness, this guy.
5938420	5939780	It's the Goonies.
5939780	5940260	No.
5940260	5940980	Yeah, no, it's not.
5941540	5944900	Was your was your laptop in the freezer?
5944900	5945940	What's that?
5945940	5946820	I'm sorry, Jeff.
5947540	5948500	OK, never mind.
5948500	5948740	Right.
5948740	5949780	This ain't my iPad.
5949780	5951060	Fingers getting sore over here.
5951060	5951540	Oh, no.
5952100	5952580	Go ahead.
5952580	5953780	Let's all pray for Jeff.
5956100	5957060	Dicks out for Jim.
5959860	5961380	Let's find this path.
5961380	5962900	Man, remember Harambe.
5962900	5963620	Good times.
5963620	5964340	Oh, man.
5964340	5964980	simpler times.
5964980	5967700	Everyone trolling involved caring about a gorilla.
5969060	5970260	Instead of a president.
5971220	5972900	Yeah, good times.
5972900	5973700	Sorry, Jeff.
5973700	5975140	I know how much you've been needing this.
5977540	5977860	Sorry.
5977860	5978340	I'm sorry.
5980020	5982260	Last time on Harmon.
5982260	5982740	Yeah.
5987060	5989460	You see this happy time murders.
5989460	5990340	I'm aware of it.
5992180	5995620	Apparently, it didn't do well this last weekend.
5995780	5996420	It did not.
5997140	6002020	Apparently, people weren't ready for the happy time murders.
6002020	6002820	OK, go.
6002820	6003060	OK.
6004900	6007380	There's edges and then there's cutting edges.
6008580	6011220	And society is not ready for the cutting edges.
6011220	6012660	They cut too many edges.
6013380	6014660	What are you telling me?
6014660	6017220	A Muppet is doing something.
6017220	6017860	What the heck?
6017860	6018980	Wait a minute.
6018980	6020100	Hold on a second.
6020100	6022180	I got a rule for Muppets in my life
6022180	6025060	and it ain't got nothing to do with this other business.
6025060	6028820	Puppets are supposed to teach me how to spell that murder.
6028820	6029300	Yeah.
6029300	6030660	Well, next thing you're telling me,
6030660	6032340	Bugs Bunny's got a cup in his hand.
6032340	6033300	What are you telling me?
6033300	6034740	Get the fuck out of here with this shit.
6035460	6037300	Get the fuck out of here with them.
6037300	6041380	You can pry my 70-year-old IP from my cold, dead fingers.
6041380	6043140	I'm not doing this.
6043140	6045940	I'm not watching no murders.
6045940	6047460	Happy, sad, angry murders.
6047460	6051140	Full of people that go like this are limited to my childhood.
6051140	6052420	Cranky anchors.
6052420	6054580	Every commercial since 1970.
6055220	6057140	And a fourth season of Community.
6057140	6057620	Let's go.
6057620	6058580	God damn it.
6061700	6062420	Last time.
6062420	6064340	You're in good company, happy time.
6064340	6065140	Go for it, please.
6066420	6067860	It was under my protest.
6067860	6069140	It was written on a whiteboard.
6069700	6070260	Keep going.
6070260	6070820	Do not do it.
6071780	6072820	You're killing your own show.
6072820	6073300	There was...
6073300	6074180	Come on, let's go.
6074180	6076100	It said the billboards say,
6076740	6079300	no sesame, all street.
6081060	6081780	No, they don't.
6081780	6082500	It doesn't really.
6082500	6083540	Yeah, they got it.
6083620	6085780	That's the actual billboard that I drove by.
6085780	6087060	Somebody needed something.
6087060	6090340	I would say, give me a little more sesame on a little less street.
6091780	6094180	You got to find that sesame street sweet spot.
6095940	6098500	Sesame Street was already Heavily Street.
6098500	6098740	Yeah.
6100260	6102100	That was actually the fucking point of the show.
6102100	6103140	That was the point, yeah.
6103140	6105380	It was truly the point of the show.
6105380	6107700	It was like, oh, these kids.
6107700	6109380	I mean, Mr. Hooper died.
6109380	6109860	Let's go.
6111060	6112900	Last time on Harmon Town.
6112900	6113540	One more thing.
6115300	6116260	Obviously, a joke is...
6116260	6116900	It's a good joke.
6116900	6119460	Lower the flag, you have mass.
6119460	6120500	It's been working a lot.
6121140	6123300	Will you please lower the flag?
6124500	6125700	He deserves to be honored.
6125700	6127780	But you haven't said anything about Senator McCain.
6127780	6128820	You've said nothing.
6128820	6129700	Oh, yeah.
6130420	6131700	Well, I think that...
6131700	6133860	Can we honor the Senator from...
6133860	6137780	Since 1986, he was the governor of Arizona, Jesus Christ.
6137780	6140340	I'm just mad at people telling other people what to do.
6140340	6142100	It's just like, everybody shut the fuck up.
6142180	6143860	Just tell us he's a hero.
6143860	6144420	Or don't.
6144420	6145460	Just shut the fuck up.
6145460	6147140	Just everybody shut the fuck up.
6147140	6147940	Just shut up.
6147940	6149140	Just shut the fuck up.
6149860	6150980	Just shut up.
6150980	6151860	But you haven't done it.
6151860	6153380	You haven't told us he's a hero yet.
6153380	6154180	I don't care.
6154180	6155540	I'm just going to shut the fuck up.
6156260	6157220	Because it doesn't matter.
6157220	6157860	That's what I want.
6157860	6159300	I don't want to hear about John McCain.
6159300	6161060	I don't not want to hear about John McCain.
6161060	6163220	I want everybody to shut the fuck up.
6163220	6164580	Quit trying to pull shit.
6164580	6166100	It doesn't fucking matter.
6166100	6166340	Yeah.
6167940	6169620	Not going to bring him back.
6169620	6170420	And that's also...
6170420	6172180	That sounds like it's about D&D.
6172180	6174180	It truly is about John McCain's death.
6175780	6177140	Just shut the fuck up.
6177140	6178100	I don't care.
6178100	6178340	Yeah.
6180020	6180980	It's my favorite...
6180980	6183300	It's become my favorite episode of the show ever.
6183300	6184580	This is a good episode, yeah.
6185220	6186020	I never thought...
6186020	6188980	I didn't think it was my favorite episode.
6188980	6190180	Now we've gone super Nova.
6191460	6192180	Super Nova.
6193380	6196020	Nova was the gateway to a satisfying episode.
6196020	6197060	Yeah, man.
6197060	6197940	We broke free.
6197940	6199460	Okay, we have 30 seconds for D&D.
6199460	6200100	Okay, here we go.
6200900	6202020	It's gonna be great.
6202020	6204500	Last time on Harmon Town, our heroes,
6204500	6206260	they were at a new town.
6206260	6206740	What was it?
6206740	6208180	The town of Doornester.
6208180	6210580	They were searching for Patchen's gem.
6210580	6212100	They found Patchen's gem,
6212100	6214900	but they lost Patchen's and set the town on fire.
6215860	6219140	They left the town and they were looking for Patchen's
6219140	6221300	when they got a crow from their friend,
6221300	6223540	Brother Absalon from the church.
6223540	6225780	He was like, you're being reassigned.
6225780	6227940	We need your help over this way
6228020	6231220	at this other place where they're having a log jam
6231220	6232820	at the stone mines.
6233620	6235620	And so you were heading over there
6235620	6237140	in the hope that Patchen's would be
6237140	6238820	in that general direction.
6238820	6240420	Then you ran into a cult,
6240420	6242500	a cult of exercise people.
6242500	6245060	You exercised with them and then left.
6245860	6247860	Then you came across another cult.
6247860	6250980	This new cult was more culty and less fun
6250980	6252500	than the last cult.
6252500	6255220	They were summoning something, a demon.
6255220	6257140	For some strangely,
6257140	6259620	and I thought of this over and over,
6259620	6262340	for some very strange and out of character reason,
6262340	6264180	two of the characters who I can't even remember
6264180	6264900	their identities,
6265460	6268500	they helped the cult summon a demon,
6269460	6271540	which is the antithesis of their jobs.
6273140	6275780	We left them in the middle of the ritual,
6275780	6277780	a gateway opening in the floor,
6277780	6280420	giant pentagram scrawled into the earth,
6280420	6282020	and through that game way,
6282020	6284660	a giant, giant fucking demon arm
6284660	6287860	was shooting forth into the material plane.
6288660	6289060	All right.
6289940	6290260	Yeah.
6296900	6297380	So.
6301540	6304820	So gate has opened up and like a huge,
6304820	6307060	this seems like it's maybe a 30 foot tall
6307060	6309620	demon's arm is bursting out of the ground.
6310180	6311140	Well, not out of the ground,
6311300	6313700	the hole in the ground that was formed by magic.
6313700	6316980	Yeah, a portal and his hand is raising way up.
6316980	6318260	Yeah, he's like crawling.
6318260	6319620	He's like reaching around,
6319620	6320980	trying to pull himself out of this
6320980	6322260	through the out of this portal right now.
6322980	6324260	Could this be our savior?
6325300	6326580	You guys are religious.
6328020	6329940	Your job is to smite evil.
6329940	6332340	Yeah, I mean, it's a big part of this whole thing.
6333780	6335380	I mean, you can turn against that,
6335380	6338100	but just let me know so I can know what to do.
6338100	6338820	We're doing our jobs.
6338820	6339860	We want this thing to come through
6339860	6340980	so we could smite it.
6340980	6342420	Yeah, let's fucking go.
6342420	6343620	Let's smite this demon.
6343620	6344420	Let's start smiting.
6344420	6345860	Just asked if it was evil.
6346740	6348020	Now you want to smite it.
6348020	6349780	Yeah, I'm just keeping my eye on you.
6351860	6353140	We're trying to have a good time.
6353140	6353300	Yeah.
6353300	6353780	Oh, yeah.
6353780	6354820	Yeah, I got a high road.
6354820	6358260	I shoot a firebolt at the demon arm.
6358260	6358740	All right.
6358740	6360100	I got to get my dice.
6360100	6362020	Oh, you didn't have your fucking dice out.
6363940	6366340	For all that fucking bluster.
6367780	6369060	Gotta get a dice.
6369060	6371780	While you're doing the dice.
6371780	6373380	Okay, go ahead.
6373380	6374340	You're doing it already.
6374340	6374660	All right.
6374660	6378100	It's immune to fire being a demon, but you do hit it.
6378100	6378420	Okay.
6378420	6379700	Well, that's something.
6379700	6381220	Yeah, it's knowledge.
6381220	6382100	Well, what?
6384180	6385220	One box check.
6385220	6387540	Do I get live and learn XP on that one?
6387540	6388020	Oh, yeah.
6388020	6389220	You get three experience.
6390020	6390580	It's good.
6393300	6394100	God damn it.
6395220	6396420	You guys take it.
6396420	6397540	Dan, you're seeing...
6398500	6400980	It's Steve and Shrob, right?
6400980	6401940	They were in the ritual.
6401940	6402660	You guys?
6402660	6403220	Yeah.
6403220	6404420	You see Steve and Shrob.
6404420	6406580	They're holding magical ritual ingredients,
6407220	6408900	and they're summoning a demon.
6408900	6410020	And you're like, what?
6410020	6411460	I look away for two seconds.
6411460	6412740	That kind of thing, you know?
6412740	6414260	That's where you're at right now.
6414260	6414500	Yeah.
6415460	6416820	What's the environment that we're in right now?
6416820	6418100	It's rolling hills.
6418100	6420020	This part's a flat expanse.
6420020	6420500	Yeah.
6420500	6422020	Also, there's no trees or anything.
6422020	6423140	Not nearby.
6423140	6423700	Just grass.
6424580	6427300	If Shrob and I stop our little ritual,
6427300	6428500	does the gateway close?
6428500	6429140	You don't know.
6430020	6430660	We're better.
6430660	6434660	There's been this ongoing thing where I'm out of everything.
6434660	6435460	That was a mistake.
6435460	6436180	I told you that.
6436180	6436820	I was wrong.
6436820	6439220	You have your spells back because it's been multiple days.
6439220	6439780	Oh, shit.
6439780	6440100	Yeah.
6440100	6440420	Sorry.
6440420	6440740	My bad.
6440740	6441060	All right.
6441060	6441780	All right.
6441780	6442500	I'm back, baby.
6443460	6443700	Wait.
6443700	6445220	Before you explain anything, Shrob,
6445220	6447380	shouldn't we just try to close this portal?
6447380	6447860	Yeah.
6447860	6449540	Let's say everything backwards.
6449540	6450040	Yeah.
6450920	6452120	Uh.
6452120	6452600	Okay.
6452600	6454280	Uh.
6454280	6454860	Um.
6454860	6456520	Well, you should do that.
6456520	6457640	You just go, Dan.
6457640	6458920	Oh, man.
6458920	6459400	Right?
6459400	6460200	Is this working?
6460200	6461320	And we're bowing up.
6464280	6465160	While we're doing this.
6466040	6468120	And we're really committing to it.
6468120	6468760	Right.
6468760	6470280	Did you, are you taking note of that?
6470280	6472040	We're really committing to it.
6472040	6472840	And like.
6472840	6473960	The biggest arms.
6473960	6475720	The biggest, the biggest arms,
6475720	6480920	and we're really nailing the backwards talking.
6480920	6482600	I think the cultists are impressed.
6482600	6483080	Yeah.
6483080	6483560	Well.
6483560	6483960	Oh, yeah.
6483960	6485320	Well, that's important.
6485320	6486120	Right.
6486120	6487400	Fucking idiot.
6489240	6490520	I was in calling.
6490520	6491000	Oh, yeah.
6491000	6491320	I know.
6491320	6495720	Let's get through this life and make sure we meet one goal.
6495720	6497240	Impress the cultists.
6498760	6499000	Yeah.
6500600	6501800	It's a chaotic world.
6501800	6503400	Oh, the mountain can talk.
6503400	6505000	There's a devil deer.
6505800	6508280	That chest has a fucking ghost in it.
6508280	6510680	But, you know, let's keep things focused.
6510680	6511880	Impress the cultists.
6512520	6513800	You fucking idiots.
6515640	6517080	You have one religion.
6517080	6517800	But not you.
6517800	6518200	You know what?
6518200	6519320	You're a shambling mound.
6519320	6521160	I expect more from you.
6522200	6524680	Thank you for acknowledging my race.
6527240	6527720	That's fine.
6527720	6529880	It's just fucking disappointing.
6529880	6532280	And I'm not saying this stuff because it would take a turn.
6532280	6532600	Okay.
6532760	6535720	I indicate that with a look.
6535720	6535960	Right.
6535960	6536760	Yeah, of course.
6536760	6541400	And also, I also want to add that it's mostly directed toward me.
6541400	6542360	Because I don't, I don't.
6542360	6543960	You should know better by now.
6543960	6547320	I don't, I don't fucking like, I don't, I'm not a commander.
6547320	6549640	I don't, I don't know how to handle this shit.
6551000	6552680	This is shit that you're doing to me.
6552680	6554360	Because I don't know how to fucking clean it up.
6555160	6555640	Okay.
6555640	6557080	Because I'm not a fucking leader.
6557080	6560040	So when you do this shit, you do it to me.
6560760	6562680	Because I'm not your fucking dad.
6563880	6566360	I'm just a dude trying to not die.
6566360	6567640	So you fuck me.
6567640	6568120	You know what?
6568120	6569000	You do this shit.
6569000	6569480	You know what?
6569480	6570040	You know what?
6570040	6570760	You know what?
6570760	6571320	Fuck it.
6571320	6572040	I'm done.
6572040	6574760	I stop bowing backwards and saying stuff.
6574760	6575720	I, I.
6575720	6576200	Shut up.
6576200	6576760	Throw down my shit.
6576760	6577560	Knock it off.
6577560	6578680	And I start walking home.
6578680	6579560	No, you don't.
6579560	6581000	No, no, shut up.
6581000	6581480	Fine.
6581480	6583320	No, you don't like how I do it?
6583320	6584040	I'm going back home.
6584040	6585400	Knock it off, knock it off.
6585400	6587800	Try to kill somebody in my living room.
6587800	6588440	You wish.
6588440	6589880	Hide up, build up.
6589880	6591320	I'm trying to deliver tea.
6591320	6592840	I never asked for this.
6592840	6594520	My dog's got to be let out.
6594520	6595320	I'm going.
6595320	6595640	All right.
6595640	6597080	Fuck all of you guys.
6597080	6597560	I'll deal with you.
6597560	6599240	I don't need to be talked to like this.
6599240	6600840	Steve, keep him away from me.
6600840	6601320	DJ.
6602840	6605640	I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to channel.
6607400	6608120	Apology.
6611880	6614280	I want to get, manage that, you rested.
6615000	6617560	I want to channel smite.
6620760	6621560	Which?
6623960	6624760	The right one.
6626760	6628840	That's an attack that you use on a target.
6628840	6632120	I want to smite the, the arm.
6632120	6633160	Yeah, I think it's, yeah.
6633160	6633640	All right.
6634520	6636040	It's a 30-foot demon arm coming out.
6636040	6637640	Yeah, and I'm smiting it.
6637640	6639160	And it's super easy to hit.
6643800	6644600	Anti-arm.
6645960	6646440	All right.
6646440	6649000	You smite it for 11 good damage.
6649000	6650440	It slices open.
6650440	6650920	Anyways.
6652680	6654040	Shrob was walking away, right?
6654040	6654920	I'm walking away.
6654920	6656440	I'm, I'm just a silhouette.
6656440	6656840	All right.
6656840	6657560	There he goes.
6657560	6658760	There he goes, everybody.
6658760	6659400	The hero.
6659400	6663000	You know, I'm calling you a hero.
6665720	6665960	Yeah.
6665960	6667560	I'm saying you're a hero.
6668760	6669240	Yeah.
6669240	6671240	I'm saying you're a hero.
6672200	6673880	I'm being sarcastic.
6675160	6678920	As Shrob walks away, instantly the portal that was being
6678920	6680600	opened starts destabilizing.
6680600	6682760	You see its edges start to waver,
6682760	6685560	and they get bigger and smaller and stuff.
6685560	6688360	And now, now, like a shoulder and a head of the demons,
6688360	6690440	like, like coming through.
6690440	6693640	But now it like kind of cinches tight on, around him.
6693640	6695720	So he's like kind of more stuck than he was,
6695720	6697480	but now he's more out than he was.
6697480	6699480	And he starts lashing out about.
6700200	6701160	Let's see what happens.
6702040	6702520	Nothing.
6704840	6706200	Well, let me, let me, let me try again.
6706760	6709960	I don't know what you're talking about,
6709960	6710840	because you're gone.
6710840	6712760	By the way, everything that happens is your fault,
6712760	6713400	because you left.
6716200	6716920	Can't hear you.
6718520	6721720	I can only hear the people that work hard to make this happen.
6721720	6723960	The cultist gesture at Steve as if to,
6723960	6726920	to try and make you reposition yourself in the circle.
6726920	6729720	Ah, well, look, we hear you.
6729720	6731080	I'm sorry, me.
6731080	6733560	And I promise this is for change.
6733560	6736360	I take my elvish blade and I go right for the,
6736360	6739960	the, the, the, the wounds that Dan created.
6739960	6740440	Okay.
6742440	6742920	You miss.
6745640	6749160	As you step out of the circle, the, the thing D, D,
6749160	6750280	what do you call it?
6750280	6751480	It deregulates.
6751480	6752200	I don't know.
6752200	6755240	It fucks up more and it, it cinches tight.
6755240	6757640	And now it looks like it's kind of strangling the demon,
6758680	6759880	but not like lethally.
6759880	6761800	Just like he's like, ah, this is an asshole.
6762760	6764840	Carlos, now this is the time to get him.
6766360	6769240	Can I cast bull strength on Carlos and give him?
6770040	6770680	Yeah, definitely.
6772280	6775160	You'll get plus four strength for one minute.
6775160	6777080	If I cast bull strength on you,
6777080	6778760	I'm going to let you fucking take this.
6781400	6782440	You're going to kill the demon.
6782440	6785160	I'm going to, I'm going to give you plus four strength.
6785160	6785640	Okay.
6788360	6789320	Can't hear you.
6789320	6790440	Don't hear anybody.
6790520	6791960	Is there a mosquito around?
6801560	6801800	Okay.
6801800	6803480	I cast bull strength on Carlos.
6803480	6804120	That happens.
6804120	6805480	You get all strong and such.
6807640	6808680	Physically, I'm strong.
6808680	6809320	Oh yeah.
6809320	6809800	Four more.
6810520	6813640	Well, then I'm going to go kick some butt.
6813640	6815400	We got a strangled demon.
6815400	6815560	Yeah.
6815560	6817480	And there's four more cultists.
6817480	6817720	Okay.
6817720	6823000	Well, then I'm physically using my, my morning star.
6823000	6823480	All right.
6825000	6826440	It's not impressive.
6827320	6828760	It is when you clock.
6828760	6829480	What do you attack?
6831400	6832360	What do you mean?
6832360	6833320	Times two critical.
6833320	6834120	What are you attacking?
6835160	6837560	The thing, the arm and the shoulder.
6837560	6839720	You clock him right in the shoulder.
6839720	6843720	It deals another 12 damage.
6843720	6844200	Yeah.
6845160	6847080	It's, it's not, it's hurting him,
6847080	6848760	but it's like, he's a giant giant.
6848760	6849160	Okay.
6849160	6851560	Thank you for the making me better than I am.
6853240	6854280	That's not really what I do.
6854280	6855640	Is the portal still closing?
6855640	6857080	It's like cinched tight around him.
6857080	6858440	The demon stuck.
6858440	6860040	It's like he can't get all the way out
6860040	6862120	because the ritual has been disrupted.
6862120	6862620	Oh.
6869320	6869960	Who's turn is this?
6871320	6872760	Hey, Chris, you want to roll the clip?

6935080	6937160	and then returned to her original intensity.
6937720	6938520	Rob Schwab.
