0	14560	From various computers in various parts of Los Angeles, California, I'm very proud to
14560	19600	say that Harman Town is now in session!
19600	24720	Hello everybody, it's me your comptroller Jeff B. Davis.
24720	32040	I'm sitting in a virtual double-down saloon in Las Vegas, Nevada because if I could go
32040	37840	somewhere and not catch COVID, I would certainly go there to catch all manner of social disease.
37840	42480	I'm very happy to be here with you all, thank you so much everyone who bought tickets, the
42480	47760	outpouring of support for this has been very magical and am I getting a little teared up?
47760	49240	A little bit.
49240	54640	You know what, if I really want to go full misty-eyed and nostalgic, just romantic daydreams
54640	59080	and sunshine, rainbows and lollipops, I think there's only one thing to do and let's bring
59080	60080	out your Game Master.
60080	66440	You know him, you adore him, you want to nestle inside him like one of those Russian dolls.
66440	69640	Let's bring out your Game Master, Mr. Spencer Crittenden!
69640	75360	Oh shit, nestling me bitch.
75360	78520	What's up baby, how's it going?
78760	82640	Not much, let's keep it rolling though, no one wants to see me.
82640	90800	Yes no, we fucking do, yes we do Spencer, yes you have the required amount of paper
90800	98240	towels back there in case shit really fucking goes wild tonight, that you are ready on clean
98240	99240	up patrol.
99240	100240	I'm on clean up duty.
100240	106640	You're gonna clean up duty, speaking of cleaning up duty Spencer, and the picture behind me,
106640	112440	the men's room here at the drawing room, rather the double down in Las Vegas, Nevada,
112440	116720	the happiest place on earth, the bar, not the city.
116720	122160	The toilet paper is on a very heavy chain and the toilet paper is so gross you'd rather
122160	123480	just not use it.
123480	131040	What should we do, should we just sit, why you gotta lock the toilet paper up?
131040	134200	Yeah, I need it for things.
134200	137240	What we didn't tell people Spencer is that this actually isn't a Harman Town reunion,
137240	139600	it's basically a launch of our new podcast.
139600	144560	This is course, we should get Dan out of here, come on, what are you doing?
144560	149600	Let's welcome out the mayor of Harman Town, his name is most of the title of the show
149600	152080	and he is the mostest of the showstest.
152080	159800	Let's bring out the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman!
159800	173760	I'm sorry, Mr. Batman, somehow you got invited into our Zoom green room, we're looking for
173760	174760	Dan Harman.
174760	185880	Oh, sorry, I am the knight, both with an N and a K, it works both ways, I am the knight
185880	188160	in both ways.
188160	195800	I just found this in my closet, it's me, it was me the whole time.
195800	199160	Why did you have that, where did you get that?
199160	206040	My new assistant Clara, when she did this closet, she was asking me, what's your dream
206040	207040	closet?
207040	213280	I want to be like Bruce Wayne when I go into my closet in the morning, I want to feel like
213280	222040	I'm getting ready to do important things and stuff and so she did a bunch of cool stuff
222040	230080	to the closet, but then to kind of, as a flourish, she put a bat cowl up on one of the shelves,
230080	234720	and that's the first time it's been used.
234720	238600	So you're sitting in one of your several walk-in closets, that's probably a good idea, you
238600	240720	get nice audio in there probably.
240720	249840	Yeah, the clothes blocks the stuff, I can heat myself up a little bit if you want, lighting
249840	250840	wise.
250840	255840	Oh, I thought you meant like entertainment wise, like you're gonna heat it up.
255840	263200	I can heat it up too that way, I will in a second.
263200	268520	There's lights in this closet that they shoot straight down, so when they're on, everything
268520	273400	becomes very shadowy, so I hope this is appropriate.
273400	279120	I like the fact that you're sitting in a closet full of clothes and that you've gone with
279120	282600	this Van Goghly t-shirt, you just kept it simple, even though all of the options are
282600	283760	available to you.
283760	288600	Well, it's not, yeah, tragically it's one of the few shirts that fits me comfortably
288600	289600	now.
289600	297120	Yeah, that's the same with my dress shirts and my suits, I've bought suits and shirts
297120	307800	over the years at varying stages of Beer Belly, so I've gone back to like early 2000s,
307800	310680	so I'm breaking up some old classics.
310680	315320	None of my pants fit basically, I just have like a rotation of athletic shorts now and
315320	321160	like nothing else that I have as bottom wear fits, it's a real issue.
321160	322160	It's no good.
322160	325720	How has your pandemic been Spencer, other than that?
325720	330160	You know, what's been sad about the pandemic is how little I've been affected by it.
330160	334800	It's like, well, this was what my life was like, and actually that is profoundly sad.
334800	339400	That's kind of like sadder than like, it'd be like, oh, I can't go to the gym like I
339400	340400	used to.
340400	342400	It's like, no, this is, this is about normal.
342400	346320	Have the same basic amount of contact with people, you know, and it's like, man, my life
346320	350920	is just disgusting and empty and if it ever comes back, I should, you know, turn away
350920	355280	from that pathetic lifestyle and try and live lead a filling life going forward.
355280	356280	Yeah.
356280	359880	That hit me for the first half of it when I was like, Oh, I'm flourishing.
359880	361120	That's really bad.
361120	365240	And then I, so then I kind of ironically stopped doing a lot of the stuff that I was doing
365240	370440	pre pandemic that would be totally pandemic compatible, like working out on Instagram
370440	371440	and stuff like that.
371440	373840	Like everything just fell away.
373840	378320	Because I kind of, I think, I think, yeah, I just kind of went into a low energy mode
378320	382720	or something, but I've been feeling, I've been feeling a comeback.
382720	385360	I think I just go in cycles and stuff.
385360	386360	Yeah.
386360	387360	Yeah.
387360	388760	Well, this is the show, folks.
388760	391240	I mean, it's what it always was.
391240	394240	It's just people hanging out.
394240	397520	It's not really, there's nothing, nothing good about it.
397520	402480	Do you have any big rants built up from years off or are you getting those out in like the
402480	403680	writers room or?
403680	404680	Yeah.
404680	407240	What's, what's, what's, what's, what's got your hackles up over the, over the last,
407240	413960	what's on the news, Dan, that that's got, that you've got bones to pick or.
413960	416640	I don't really, I don't really have anything.
416640	420360	I'm really sorry to tell you that, but that's good news for our guests because then we don't
420360	424360	have to, they don't have to wait through some kind of like supposed monologue, but I had
424360	432160	one thought about like, you know, I don't even think this is going to track, but I,
432160	437560	I, you know, I keep joking with Cody, like, what are you going to do?
437560	442560	Leave me, you know, like during the pandemic, like it's, it's kind of like, and then I,
442560	447280	but it's a very real thing that I keep thinking, like, you know, you got to get out in front
447280	452920	of the pandemic ending because there's going to be, there's going to be like this, I picture
452920	459040	the street will be filled with pandemic suitors, like it'll be kind of almost a reverse Ulysses
459120	465840	thing where there's just going to be all these horny guys, like flooding the streets and
465840	471620	kind of like, they're going to know that they're, they're, they can call out to like a city
471620	478320	full of mistreated women, um, they're going to, they're, they're, they're extroverts themselves
478320	483800	and they've been like, you know, languishing indoors and not being able to go to bars and
483800	484960	hit on people and stuff.
484960	490480	And all of those people are going to like run into the streets like, uh, like milk and
490480	491480	honey.
491480	496240	And then, so it's like, I think now is the time if you've been kind of taking your lover
496240	501640	for granted, you should probably start pretending the pandemic's over in terms of how many times
501640	503720	a week you shower and stuff like that.
503720	508040	Yeah, I, I've, I've, I've let myself go.
508040	513160	I put a suit on when I do one of these shows, but I'm generally, I've been wearing the same
513160	519080	pair of jeans, I think since March and I put a suit on very, very seldomly, uh, usually
519080	520800	just for things like this.
520800	524960	And it's the first time since I was like a little boy that I actually blew one of the
524960	526440	knees out in my jeans.
526440	528640	I have ripped jeans now.
528640	534080	Apparently I've, I've gone to a Scott Bayo status, uh, during the pandemic and I, and,
534080	537240	uh, it's, it's, it's not good.
537240	544000	I, I, I, there's two, uh, liquor stores in town that I don't even think they're happy
544000	545000	to see me anymore.
545000	546240	I think they feel bad for me.
546240	550080	I walk in and keep getting more for net bronca and they're like, yeah, it's okay.
550080	552320	They're like, oh, a great customer.
552320	557800	They're like, you need to fucking go to the gym and maybe, you know, see somebody.
557800	559320	I don't, I don't go anywhere.
559320	563840	I haven't, I, I, yeah, I don't, uh, there's a, there's lots of people out there that are
563840	568680	just kind of splitting the difference, I guess they're, they're going places and doing stuff.
568680	575080	So, you know, I, I think, I think I was exposed to it very early on because Laura, my ex-girlfriend
575080	579800	and a very good friend still, uh, we were in Italy together and we thought that she
579800	586720	got really sick and we thought that she had West Nile fever, not West Nile virus, but
586720	588520	West Nile fever.
588520	594040	And now looking back on it, cause it was, I think December, January in, uh, January
594040	599680	in Italy, which became an instant hotspot for, for COVID that her symptoms were absolutely
599680	600880	COVID symptoms.
600880	602560	And then I was with her the whole time.
602560	608080	So I think I was exposed to it and was asymptomatic and didn't ever, you know, didn't really ever
608080	609120	have it.
609120	610680	So I'm fucking bulletproof.
610680	612240	I'm the real Batman here.
612240	617840	Of course, Jeff's fucking immune to the coronavirus fucking course I bet.
617840	622680	I've been out banging elderly people that old folks, um, since I thought about April.
622680	625080	I'm still confused about the rules though.
625080	632840	Like for my understanding of it, even pre-vaccine is, well, don't get it.
632840	634040	Don't risk getting it.
634040	639200	Like, like when people are like, well, if I get it, I'll just, uh, I don't care.
639200	641520	I should have a right to know it's not about you.
641520	644400	It's about you being an antenna for this thing that's going to kill an old woman.
644400	645400	You don't know.
645720	651520	And, uh, but my big question is, uh, what, what, what, what, what's with the, uh, with
651520	652520	the vaccine?
652520	657440	Like if you get the vaccine, I still, I still don't understand if I get vaccinated tomorrow,
657440	663520	can I still give, can I still carry the, the virus and then give it to other people who
663520	664520	are still going to get sick?
664520	668320	Because that's, that's, that's pretty much identical to not getting a vaccine as far
668320	673520	as the vaccine, it supposedly just kind of prevents, prevents a worse version of the
673520	674520	illness.
674520	678760	You could still get sick, you could still be taken out for like months, but you probably
678760	681760	won't end up at the hospital and have death.
681760	685520	I don't even know how clear it is on like, whether yourself or long-term effects like
685520	691360	lung damage or whatever, you might still even get that, but yeah, it's definitely not ideal,
691360	695360	but it's supposed to help prevent death, which is the best, you know, the biggest thing,
695360	696360	but you can still get it.
696360	697360	I'm really sorry.
697360	701560	I know I shouldn't be budding in right now, but, uh, I think Spencer is wrong about the
701560	705320	vaccine, but I'll come in later and talk about it because I've read a lot about this.
705320	706320	Okay.
706320	707320	I'd love to be long.
707320	708320	I think we should bring.
708320	709320	Yeah.
709320	711600	I have a couple of things to say about that too.
711600	714960	So when you guys are ready, when you guys are ready, keep, keep going.
714960	719200	We're just going to finish this segment or you guys are doing great.
719200	720200	We love you guys.
720200	721200	I can wait.
721200	722200	I just wanted you to know, I can wait.
722200	723200	Okay.
723200	724200	Big fan.
724200	725200	Big fan.
725200	726200	Yeah.
726200	728920	I mean, I've done what I wanted to say on the show, so I'm out later guys.
728920	729920	Oh shit.
729920	730920	Now we lost.
730920	731920	Bird on a wire.
731920	732920	That fucking guy.
732920	733920	Oh no.
733920	737600	I don't know the production value and then boom, he's gone.
737600	741120	Um, uh, why don't we bring out some of our guests?
741120	745720	Well, I think we should start just in a good old fashioned, uh, fashion.
745720	751800	Uh, let's bring out, uh, how do you introduce Rob Schwab by just, I think you just say Rob
751800	754080	Schwab is here, everybody.
754080	756120	Buckle up your holy shit belts.
756640	766520	Oh, damn, you're going to weigh in on the science of trans transmission after having
766520	767520	the vaccination.
767520	768520	Yes.
768520	772920	It's, uh, it's, uh, don't do it.
772920	777160	I'm just never leaving again.
777160	781840	I can't wait for people to try to tell me, Hey, we really need you to come into work.
781840	782840	Oh, do you?
782840	783840	Yeah.
783840	788280	I, I've got a year's worth of data to suggest you're bluffing.
788280	791920	I'm pretty sure I don't, you don't need me to come into work.
791920	799120	They announced like this week that like snow days are a thing of the past for schools.
799120	803440	You know, like, so like the day, the days of kids waking up in the morning and going
803440	809600	and the snow is coming down, they'll go, yeah, it's snowing outside.
809600	813280	Can't go outside, but we'll see you at the same time.
813600	817840	Guess, guess, we'll guess we get to do 40 more minutes of math snow boy.
820000	821800	So I, I, I grew up in LA.
821800	822840	We had smog days.
822840	824160	We never had snow days, obviously.
824160	827240	And there were, there were days where the smog was so bad that you weren't allowed
827240	832600	to leave the classroom because you might, I don't know, like get, uh, Mesothelioma.
832600	833440	I don't know what the fuck it was.
833440	836800	It was a lot of dragons, a lot of dragons.
837400	839880	Should we, should we bring out our, should we bring out our extra guests or should we
839880	841880	just make the audience with me?
841880	842360	Sure.
842360	842720	Yeah.
842720	846840	If you've tapped everything you can get out of me in that short amount of time.
846840	847480	Is that okay?
847480	851320	Well, yeah, go bring on the star.
851320	855440	I can't believe, I can't believe the Rob shrub, uh, level of restraints that you,
855440	859480	you issued, Rob, you throughout the first minutes of the show, you always had the
859480	864160	power to turn on your mic or your video and be doing bits in the background.
865160	866400	I was sitting on my hands.
866400	869960	I had a couple of openings and I was like, nope, I got to do it.
870280	873160	Did you see my last, my last note in the chat room here?
873160	876320	I said, like, Rob, I think you should start doing some, some bits in the background.
878640	881960	No, but then you jumped the gun and you, you already started doing, or Kameil beat
881960	886200	you to the fucking punch because Kameil, uh, is, you know, he's, he's, he strikes
886200	886880	like a cobra.
887120	887680	He's good.
887760	888280	He's good.
888280	888600	Yeah.
890240	891920	Jeff said that in the chat.
891960	892640	That's a lie.
893760	899680	I only had one bit prepped and I just did it and everybody just fucking
900960	902280	Gas a little bit.
902600	903240	What was the bit?
903240	903680	I didn't see.
903680	905680	This is the bit you told me.
905680	906560	This isn't funny.
906560	908440	I got to, I got to pin it.
908480	909400	I got to pin it.
909440	909800	Hold on.
909800	910600	Let me pin it.
910880	916080	I got to do a full of, uh, indiscriminately stored Emmys here.
916080	919840	Like them treating Emmys like they're, uh, that's great.
919960	920600	That's great.
920600	923760	You assume when does much too small.
923760	924200	I did it.
924200	929200	It looks like, like a lot of like second grade trophies from like, like, like, you
929200	930360	know, little league and stuff like that.
930360	931520	No, it was funny.
931640	932200	Come on.
932200	932880	It was good.
932880	933440	Everybody.
933440	936240	Maybe I'm not flourishing during the pandemic.
938320	941840	Maybe I need to get back out in the streets for my comedy to work.
942480	947200	I think that it's amazing that your beard has grown almost perfectly to reach the
947200	950440	edge of your, your earbuds.
951440	954160	It's perfectly framing your beard.
954160	957400	It'd be great if you could take it off and go, I don't know what you're
957400	958000	talking about.
958880	963520	If my, if my beard gets any longer, yeah, the, the, the, the earbuds will have to
963520	964960	like, they'll like take the thing out.
965120	967520	When I, when I put my shirt on in the morning, it's kind of fun.
967520	970640	Cause like, uh, look, I go like, Oh, I got a smaller beard.
970640	972920	And then that's what Spencer looks like right now.
972920	976360	I'm used to Spencer having that long of a beard and it looks like he's tucked it
976360	979080	in his blue screen, uh, jumpsuit.
979440	980840	I shaved my whole ass beard.
980840	981960	I was clean shaven.
981960	984360	And I got to tell you, I didn't shave your ass.
985720	986920	How long was it?
987160	987840	The whole thing.
988160	991000	The whole beard.
991160	991440	Yeah.
991440	992360	My whole ass beard.
993400	993640	Right.
995640	997840	See, I told you shrub would take over.
997920	998680	Fuck off.
999240	1001760	You know, everybody, I want, I want you to take over.
1001760	1003320	I was doing a terrible job.
1003320	1006800	I, I, I really queefed it with that Batman mask.
1006840	1012040	I don't, I want to say I don't care, but I do.
1013120	1016040	Um, you really queefed it with the Batman man.
1017040	1020480	Is queef, queef, queef should be stricken from the parlance, right?
1020480	1020880	Yeah.
1020880	1025120	You queef the bed on the Batman man, you really queefed it.
1025720	1029200	You queefed, you queef the pod, you queef the zoom, baby.
1029720	1032000	You really queefed in church on that one, man.
1032000	1032360	Yeah.
1032400	1035640	Whereas you should have been shredding the gnar, you queef to the bed.
1036960	1044040	You know, guys, our next guest would be a podcast gets, even if they weren't the
1044440	1047960	George and Martha Washington of our podcast.
1048440	1055280	Um, they, they've got reunion value and regular guest value because they're
1055280	1058600	prolific, they're hot stuff.
1059040	1059880	They're.
1063800	1064600	God damn it.
1065280	1066960	Fucking people are paying for this.
1067440	1068200	Let's bring them out.
1068280	1069840	I'll pull the trigger on this.
1069840	1070880	We're very happy to have them.
1071200	1077320	When we, we decided, uh, well, I guess I decided that I asked the group, would
1077320	1078600	you guys want to do this reunion?
1078600	1079680	Cause I think people would enjoy it.
1080160	1083120	There was no question about who the first people I would ask to have guests on the
1083120	1083520	show.
1083520	1084320	And here they are.
1084520	1085560	Um, I love them.
1085560	1087280	And I'm certain that you did too.
1087440	1088240	Emily V.
1088240	1090800	Gordon and Kumail Nanjiani, everybody.
1090800	1092440	Hello.
1093640	1094280	Oh, shit.
1095680	1097160	Wow.
1097160	1097880	Holy shit.
1098880	1099720	Holy shit.
1101720	1102880	Hi everybody.
1103400	1104360	How exciting.
1105880	1107720	Look at all these beautiful faces.
1109600	1115160	Are you guys, Emily, you look like you just emerged from a very successful,
1115280	1118760	like eighties, like, uh, uh, rock video.
1118760	1119600	You look fantastic.
1120360	1121000	That is correct.
1121040	1122600	I was on a motorcycle.
1122600	1125000	I was shaking around and did some stuff on a hood.
1125520	1127040	Um, I think it's going to turn out well.
1127040	1127640	We'll see.
1128520	1130400	But your hair, your hair is tremendous.
1130400	1131640	You've got this gauzy lighting.
1131640	1132760	It's very, it's working.
1133280	1136520	The gauzy lighting is because your camera lens is dirty.
1136520	1137360	Probably watch this.
1138960	1140760	On gauzy, it'll get dream lighting.
1140800	1142880	What are you, are you cleaning it with your hair?
1143760	1144440	Those are shirts.
1144440	1146880	No, they're animal print the top.
1147360	1147560	Yeah.
1149040	1150200	It's not dream anymore.
1150520	1151160	Dream lighting.
1151480	1154360	Are you guys in the same time zone as us and each other?
1156200	1156440	Yeah.
1156440	1157520	She's right over the break.
1157640	1165720	We want to announce our divorce on the show that we, you know, we
1165720	1169440	were like, uh, there's like boxes in the background or Camille's
1169440	1173400	shot and it's just like, the word dishes and it's written
1173400	1177120	sarcastically, like you dumb dishes.
1180760	1183880	And we just occasionally get glimpses in Emily's background of
1183880	1186440	a very hot yoga instructor guy with no shirt on with like a
1186440	1191920	man, man, he's like, he's bringing her out like mango
1191920	1193640	lassies and teas and stuff like that.
1193880	1194480	Yeah.
1194600	1197680	And I just have faces drawn on my walls that are my new friend.
1200480	1204880	First of all, I want to say, uh, sorry to put it on the vaccine
1204880	1205240	thing.
1205280	1206080	No, I want to know.
1206800	1212640	I feel like there has been, uh, it's been communicated so badly,
1212640	1213280	so poorly.
1213280	1216400	So the vaccines are really, really, really, really good.
1216760	1217920	People should take them.
1218480	1222160	They haven't like finished the studies yet, but the science says
1222160	1226040	that when you have the vaccine, you likely will not, uh, spread it.
1226640	1231120	And, um, uh, those things came out today in Israeli study that, that
1231160	1237120	90%, uh, it reduces transmission by 90% and they're going to peer
1237120	1240920	review it, but the scientists are pretty confident that once you
1240920	1243280	get this vaccine, you can't spread the virus either.
1243280	1244200	They neutralize it.
1244200	1248680	It's not just that you don't have the effects of, you don't, it's not
1248680	1250400	just that you don't get the symptoms of it.
1250760	1252360	You, it kills the virus.
1252720	1257480	And when this is 95% effective, that means the other 5% they get it
1257480	1261680	have very mild cases and nobody ended up at the hospital out of like
1261680	1265040	tens of thousands of people, when they say serious case, that was
1265040	1266720	somebody who had like a fever for a week.
1266920	1268120	So these vaccines are amazing.
1268120	1271480	So I just, I feel everything he's saying is true, but also now you
1271480	1272800	see why we had to get divorced.
1275720	1277960	He won't stop talking about this vaccine.
1278200	1278440	Yes.
1278440	1278600	Yes.
1278600	1281120	Oh, all we said, Camille was past the butter.
1281240	1285200	And then, and then these, these vaccines are really good guys.
1285480	1289520	We, we, we got to get, I'm, I'm specifically talking about non-Giana
1289520	1292120	max, the vaccine.
1292560	1298880	It's my, it's my GoFundMe, go to nongiana.tv.biz.
1299120	1300040	We'll come to you.
1300040	1301280	We will come to you.
1302280	1303120	I've got the formula.
1303120	1306360	I just need the infrastructure to produce millions of doses.
1306640	1307760	I've got five.
1308120	1309680	I took two bagel, got three.
1309920	1310960	I'm going to deserve it.
1312320	1313160	Well, that's good news.
1313160	1317960	And it is interesting how, I mean, like obviously I sometimes I think it's
1317960	1323520	kind of a fortunate thing that the disease dropped during the
1323520	1326120	administration of the fake news guy.
1326600	1333440	And that the problematic portion of our little melting pot, like the kinds
1333440	1338920	of people that even before, like way back in the way back, we used to laugh
1338920	1340880	at them because they were anti-vax.
1341440	1347600	Um, like it's kind of nice that they were put in a position, uh, where they
1347600	1349880	had to be like, what disease?
1350040	1354960	And then, because now the vaccine rolling out, which is going to inevitably
1354960	1358280	be, you know, it's not going to work right for everybody.
1358280	1363160	It's, there's going to be like big time, like, like, like, you know, it's a,
1363160	1367080	it's a life saving vaccine that now has to be rolled out in a time of crisis.
1367080	1373120	And like, it could have been a real political, like, uh, like catastrophe.
1373160	1376640	If it weren't for the fact that it kind of got pre-lapped in the, I don't know.
1376680	1379800	Sometimes I think it's nice how the, how that stuff works.
1380440	1385080	Well, something like 50% of people eligible to get the vaccine are refusing it.
1385080	1388800	So it's not like this miracle rollout or everyone's buying into it, right?
1388800	1389320	No, I know.
1389320	1392560	I know that I guess, I guess I, yeah, I'm not discounting that fact.
1392560	1395600	I didn't mean to imply that because of the timing of all this, all of those
1395600	1398560	people are going to be smart now or that they're going to take their vaccine.
1399200	1400320	I just think, I don't know.
1400320	1401800	I'm not even sure quite what I'm saying.
1401800	1404720	I was hoping maybe you guys would take it and turn it into a smarter thought.
1405160	1409800	I do think they should have, they should have hired a PR firm to like, do some
1409800	1412800	sort of like an information campaign about it, which they didn't even.
1412800	1415120	I feel like there's been not enough.
1415360	1416360	Yeah, I do.
1416400	1420840	I feel optimistic that as more people get it and we don't have side effects and
1420840	1424880	transmission goes down and people see it's effective, that vaccine hesitancy
1424880	1426520	will end, but Emily's right.
1426840	1428200	There should have been more work.
1428200	1430880	Like, Hey, these vaccines are really, really good.
1430920	1433840	Instead of when you get the vaccine, you're still going to have to wear a mask.
1434280	1439200	We've really queefed the bat when it comes to like the PR on this rollout.
1439480	1441760	And the last place you want to queef is the bed.
1444560	1445520	Well, I mean,
1446720	1446920	Yeah.
1446920	1447880	Where do you want to queue?
1447920	1452600	Well, in the Renaissance, they had those special like bird beak shaped things for
1452600	1456120	the ladies that were like, they were, they were filled with lilac and other
1456120	1458520	herbs that were supposedly filtering the.
1459080	1459480	That's good.
1459480	1460520	I was going to say hot tub.
1460520	1461840	I think you want to please the hot tub.
1463640	1463840	Yeah.
1463840	1465320	It's the perfect crime.
1466400	1467640	There's no victims.
1467680	1469320	It's a victimless crime, honestly.
1469320	1471760	You're just helping the hot tub do what it does.
1472320	1472640	Yes.
1472640	1476960	You you're basically like, you're, you're, you're giving a fist bump to the jets.
1476960	1479000	You're like, you keep, keep it going.
1479240	1480360	I like, I like your style.
1481200	1481880	I got you.
1483520	1485600	I have, I have another thought.
1485600	1491800	I was thinking today, you know, like 20 years from now, even though 20 years from now,
1491800	1493640	there probably won't be movies and TV.
1493640	1498120	As we understand it, there'll be holograms and Pokemons and whatever, but whatever the
1498120	1502040	movies and TV of tomorrow, whatever popular culture is, and there'll be people telling
1502040	1507040	stories and there'll be archetypes in those stories, like an archetype 20 years from now
1507040	1514440	in certain stories will be the canceled actor from the, from the early 21st century.
1514440	1519880	Like, like there'll be like, there'll be like these characters in like, uh, movies
1519880	1524480	where like, like there'd be like an older character and then they'll be like, uh, kind
1524480	1526960	of like fallen from grace mentor.
1526960	1529320	And the person will be like, what, who are you?
1529320	1530080	What happened to you?
1530080	1532760	And then the, like the call to adventure or threshold will be somebody going like,
1533040	1534880	that's, that's Olivia Johnson.
1534880	1536160	She got canceled.
1536280	1538920	Um, back, back in the cancellation days.
1538920	1544360	And like, like it won't like, it'll be like being, yeah, it won't, the point won't be
1544360	1548280	that she shouldn't have been or should have been, but the point will be that she, she
1548280	1550280	didn't get to be who she was or whatever.
1550280	1551960	And that's why she's such a great acting teacher.
1551960	1555360	Like whatever the Roger Rabbit reboot will be.
1555360	1561000	It's like, instead of the dip, it'll be like the cancel, um, barrel, the
1561000	1566880	cancel barrel, I mean, and they'll put that shoe in, that shoe was so sad.
1566880	1570600	You dip the squeaky shoes in the cancel barrel and then, oh, fuck.
1570920	1575040	That prediction I disagree with, but I can live without it.
1575400	1577280	No, Jesus.
1577280	1579720	What in the, what do you like soy sauce?
1580040	1584480	What the fuck is that, is that, is that Sri Racha?
1584480	1585800	What the fuck you got there, baby?
1586160	1587880	Are you drinking a baby?
1588760	1591480	That like close to the camera or is it huge?
1591920	1594560	No, no, it's my water bottle.
1595200	1597680	Oh, it's giving me gentle encouragement.
1597760	1599400	It's giving me gentle encouragement.
1599400	1600600	I don't know if you could see it.
1600600	1605280	It's reverse on mine, but it says, only yet remember your goal that you got a lot of
1605280	1605880	work to do.
1605960	1610200	Keep, I know I'm way behind, but that's because I'm fucking around with you guys.
1610320	1610720	Yes.
1610800	1615080	And the very bottom level says urinary tract infection.
1615840	1617600	You can drink too much water.
1618200	1619920	No, that's not true.
1621000	1621920	It is.
1621960	1624680	My grandmother was hospitalized for drinking too much water.
1624720	1626120	I didn't know that he died.
1626840	1629800	She was trying to win a switch for her kids and instead she died or a wee in
1629800	1636200	Nintendo Wii, that works because when you drink a lot of water, you, we, right?
1636240	1637040	Hello.
1637360	1637880	Okay.
1637880	1638640	Me, man.
1638640	1639440	I hold it in.
1640280	1641840	Quarantine's been tough.
1642480	1647640	No, what you don't see on the bottom of the shrubs, giant tub of water is there's a
1647640	1651280	catheter that pumps as urine right back into it and it's just a cyclical flow.
1652520	1653960	No, that's not true.
1654160	1655120	Keep chugging.
1655640	1656920	Keep your goal.
1656960	1658120	Feeling awesome.
1660120	1660440	Yeah.
1660440	1661280	Feeling awesome.
1661320	1668240	You guys are going to be so jealous when I finished this, when I finished this water,
1668720	1673640	when I get down to these mountains, you guys are going to be so jealous.
1673680	1674520	Keep talking.
1674560	1678000	I'm going to finish it before the end of this podcast.
1678040	1679040	Place your bets.
1679880	1680960	Oh my God.
1681000	1682520	I would love for that to happen.
1683120	1683320	Okay.
1683320	1690480	But Rob, Rob, you're, you're not allowed to get up and leave your chair at any time.
1690480	1691720	You have to stay in the seat.
1691760	1693360	I'm 51, man.
1693360	1694600	This is going to be awkward.
1695320	1703040	So do you guys open, open question for the table, who identifies as an introvert versus
1703040	1703720	an extrovert?
1703760	1709280	Like, and, and have you noticed, like, surely you've reconciled that with the pandemic.
1709280	1715520	Have you ever, have you gone like, I, I am languishing here because I get my batteries
1715520	1721680	charged by other people and it sucks versus, you know, and I, I'm not going to be able
1721680	1728040	to talk to Spencer a lot, like, like, no, we've been calling, we've been on the phone
1728040	1729040	for both introverts.
1729040	1734960	We haven't spoken a couple hours each day to us to touch based, you know, when did you
1734960	1735960	talk to him?
1737360	1741400	The only reason we've seen, we're seeing each other now is because the one extrovert
1741400	1747120	here decided we needed to do a reunion show because he's like a, he's like a, he's
1747120	1756000	like a fern planted on a desert, this is a fucking guy, literally your best friend.
1757000	1757520	Okay.
1757520	1761400	I'm just, because I don't know if Emily, Emily and Kumail, like, I wouldn't know between
1761400	1766640	the two of you, like, if one, if either of you are, you know, like, wouldn't shock me
1766640	1772480	if you went Emily's on the right, Emily, what do you say for one of you, I'm, I'm definitely
1772480	1776880	more of an introvert in that I like, I like, I like, I like, I like, I like, I like, I
1776880	1779360	like doing social stuff, but it makes me very tired.
1779360	1783480	And so similarly to Spencer, my life, and I do most of my work at home.
1783480	1787760	So my life did not change a lot when this started.
1787760	1791080	The only thing that changed was me being like, I guess I should like schedule a lunch with
1791080	1795440	some friends because I think of everything like the stems and I'm like regular contact.
1795440	1797240	That's how you keep your friends.
1797240	1802360	So you did, so, so, and so you, you, you get, you kind of forced yourself to do that.
1802360	1804800	Like, like, like you had like play dates and stuff.
1804800	1809240	And I knew, oh, that's something you did before, not during the, yeah, no, we haven't
1809240	1810240	seen anybody.
1810240	1815080	Yeah, we don't see anybody, but before I would have to like force myself and I would still
1815080	1816080	enjoy it.
1816080	1820080	Like I, but like, it would be like a, it wasn't a thing that my heart was like, I'm yearning
1820080	1824160	for a lunch with a friend, but I would always like it when I did it.
1824160	1834480	I think I never realized how much of the part of me that would go out was doing it for fear
1834480	1837040	of ostracization.
1837040	1841680	So I'm kind of indirect, like just thinking like, I don't want to be the person that everyone
1841680	1843480	stops inviting to things.
1843480	1848760	I don't want to, it, it, it, and it's not a case of whether or not that's good or bad
1848760	1853360	or healthy or unhealthy, but it's just amazing to take all of that out of the spreadsheet
1853360	1857760	and how much it was like, it didn't make me instantly happy.
1857760	1864320	I don't wake up every day happier than I, yeah, a little, probably like five, 10% happier
1864800	1871720	like fucking pandemic rules, but just as a baseline, but, but, but just like the amount
1871720	1876960	of like, just like weight off the shoulders, like it's kind of amazing to me.
1876960	1883080	And I think that's a healthy thing because I don't think my extroverted friends, what,
1883080	1886560	if I had ever told them that that was going on in my head, the first thing they would
1886560	1888960	have said is don't do that to us or yourself.
1888960	1890560	Don't be thinking that stuff.
1890560	1896640	Like, like, like we don't want you making calculations about whether you should come
1896640	1903120	join us at a bar and like you're thinking about whether if you do your life or this
1903120	1908280	or that, like goddamn, we do it because we're extroverts and we have fun.
1908280	1915120	And now like, if the pandemic has an end to it, like I can now think clearly, I think
1915120	1920520	about like a little more clearly about who I am and what I want and not burden other
1920520	1925720	people with my bullshit about like what, what I'm trying to accomplish with them.
1925720	1928720	Can I, can I disagree with you on one thing there?
1928720	1931480	All I said was my feelings.
1931480	1932480	No, no, no.
1932480	1938040	You think that your, that your friends probably are like, no, don't do it for us.
1938040	1939160	I'm not like that.
1939160	1942720	I'm like, whatever math you have to do to like, come out and hang out with me.
1942720	1943720	I'm happy with that.
1944160	1947240	Same with Shrav, you know, like I would see Shrav at parties and then he would want to
1947240	1951720	leave early and I would guilt him into trying to stay because I, I wanted to hang out with
1951720	1952720	you guys.
1952720	1953720	So that's how you roll.
1953720	1957560	Yeah, I'll grab some guilt.
1957560	1960200	So Camille, are you, are you an extrovert?
1960200	1965360	Camille, if I had to guess, if I, if I had to like wager on this, I would say that you
1965360	1971800	would have tilted slightly toward introversion because that's most of my comedy friends tent
1971800	1974880	and like, like, especially stand up friends of mine, there's a, there's a little bit of
1974880	1979920	an introverted part of you, but are you, are you kind of both sides of that coin?
1979920	1981640	Where do you follow that?
1981640	1986600	I would say, you know, uh, if you define introvert by where you get energy from, I get energy
1986600	1991600	from being alone or with Emily at home, like watching movies and stuff and, and, and hanging
1991600	1992600	out at home.
1992600	1995720	But as Emily said, I do turn into captain party.
1995720	2000200	So there were some times when I'm, when I used to be out where I would be like, really
2000200	2006360	like Emily was like owner captain parties out and then you'll think people into staying
2006360	2008040	longer and that kind of stuff.
2008040	2011560	So, so it was really, it was sort of extremes, right Emily?
2011560	2012840	Yeah, I would say so.
2012840	2016920	But you, I've at least taken like, I'll take an outdoor walk with a friend every once in
2016920	2017920	a while.
2017920	2024400	You don't see any, nobody, you got, you, yeah, I'm fully terrified of this thing.
2024400	2029840	And I, I, I have not seen anybody, uh, really, that's the thing I'm, I'm really scared too.
2029840	2035200	But I think like Dan, I make those calculations too, but I think that they're like, I do it
2035200	2036840	because I know it's beneficial to me.
2036840	2039920	Like I'm not thinking like, Oh, I should see friends because I don't want them to like
2039920	2040920	think I'm not around.
2040920	2043800	I do it because I'm like, I know I'm going to feel better if I like hang out with someone
2043800	2047400	I like, I know I'm going to, and this isn't the before times end now.
2047400	2051360	I know I'm going to feel better if I like have a social interaction with someone, but
2051360	2054720	I'll be damned if I'm like really tired and don't really feel like doing it.
2054720	2060320	But I, I don't do the calculation that like, it doesn't feel sciency to me or like manipulative.
2060320	2064280	It just feels like, Oh, I know I'm going to like this, but I'm not going to look up until
2064280	2065280	I get there.
2065280	2066280	Yeah.
2066280	2069120	I mean, we have the luxury of following our bliss and in autumn and it actually intersects
2069120	2073760	with like doing the right thing during a pandemic.
2073760	2078480	I want to take this time to put some metals on some chests of some people that are not
2078480	2079800	in that category.
2079800	2086320	My fiance could, you know, she's, she is a, you know, on the, on that, on that, whatever
2086320	2091000	Enneagram test or whatever, where you get your, all your letters and stuff.
2091000	2092160	She's a campaigner.
2092160	2096200	I don't know if she's, you know, she's, she's, she, she recharges with me.
2096200	2097200	We hang out in bed.
2097200	2103240	We do all these things, but she definitely, she, she, she gets, she gets her energy charged
2103240	2104960	by other people.
2104960	2112800	And she and, and her friend, Anna Kendrick, who like both of them same boat where they're
2112800	2116820	like, they're not, they probably don't even know who they are when they're not like hanging
2116820	2119040	out with, with, with, with people.
2119040	2125200	And they regularly get tested because they have a regular hangout and then they, and
2125200	2129680	then sometimes like one of them, like their test doesn't come back because there's a windstorm
2129680	2131000	or something and whatever.
2131000	2133440	And they're like, they're so committed to it.
2133440	2134760	That's actual sacrifice.
2134760	2138920	They're like following their bliss and going like, well, we gotta, we should hang out.
2138920	2145520	And, but I'll, as soon as I'm put up to, you know, as soon as there's any test of my will,
2145520	2146880	I'll probably falter.
2146880	2152720	I like had my friends over for election night and like, I stopped giving a fuck with, I
2152720	2158120	was like, I was wearing a mask when they came to the door and I had put bowls of chips six
2158120	2159120	feet apart.
2159120	2162040	And then it's like, by the end of the night, we're just hanging out.
2162040	2167560	And like, because I'm following my bliss really, and it's easy to follow during a pandemic.
2167560	2173840	And there are people out there who are like, this fucking sucks, but I'm really going to
2173840	2175640	do the right thing for other people.
2175640	2176640	And I'm there.
2176640	2179360	I, I really, I'm really impressed by them.
2179360	2180360	Yeah.
2180360	2185240	Is following your bliss being introverted and being came with it or is following your bliss
2185240	2190280	being like, fuck, fuck the pandemic, put those chips together?
2190280	2197920	Well, uh, for now, I'm just, well, following my bliss is like, like I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
2197920	2198920	like lazy.
2198920	2204920	I'm like, I, I'm, I, I, I like, I can, following my bliss will be like, I was excited to set
2204920	2205920	up for election night.
2205920	2210480	I was like, Dino and Jeff are going to come over and I'm going to, I'm going to, it's
2210480	2212200	like a designing a spaceship.
2212200	2215760	I'm going to put the chips over here and I'm going to, everybody will be able to not touch
2215760	2218880	each other and the cups will be disposable and all these things.
2218880	2219880	But that's because
2219880	2226760	it was only like, like, there was only like, you only had like two other chairs, like when
2226760	2229200	you invited dino house is pretty small.
2229200	2231120	I don't know how many people he could fit.
2231120	2232120	It's cozy.
2232120	2233720	I would call it cozy.
2233720	2234720	Yeah.
2234720	2235720	Cozy.
2235720	2236720	Yeah.
2236720	2237720	I've been there.
2237720	2240320	It's, uh, you would never have left the house had you been asked.
2240320	2241320	Yeah.
2241320	2242320	We were asked.
2242320	2243320	Yeah.
2243320	2244320	It's probably true.
2244320	2248040	I feel like some of my friends who are intro to our introverts that feel guilted into being
2248040	2252560	social because they feel like that's a thing that you have to do to, to not be ostracized
2252560	2261120	or, or eliminated, forgotten, forgotten, forgotten that they've used, uh, forgotten.
2261120	2267360	Is somebody got forgotten that they've, they've used their, their introversion and their, their
2267360	2273200	loved, uh, their love of staying at home as though they really, really are like safety
2273200	2274200	freaks.
2274200	2280520	And they're kind of wearing that like a feather in their hat, like they're, they're doing
2280520	2281520	the right thing.
2281520	2282520	Like, no, you're loving it.
2282520	2283880	You don't never have to do shit.
2283880	2284880	Yeah.
2284880	2289680	That's what I, I, I try, yeah, I try to police myself internally of like, I try to like,
2289680	2291160	oh, are you doing anything difficult?
2291160	2297360	And that's how I like, like when I, early on when I would see people on Twitter, like
2297360	2303000	questioning the quarantine and all that stuff, like, like my initial reaction to be like,
2303000	2305320	you fucking dick, like how dare you?
2305320	2307400	That's the problem with this blah, blah, blah.
2307400	2313080	But um, you know, and I, I like, I have to remind myself like Jesus Christ, like, like,
2313080	2315360	like imagine this sucking for people.
2315360	2323400	Like when have you ever done anything that hasn't been a fucking blast for you, uh, animation
2323400	2329120	producer, now it's a pandemic and so now you can abuse labor while, while you do woodwork
2329120	2332800	in your garage with a fucking Tony Stark camera system.
2332800	2335440	Like I, I, it's fun.
2335440	2340520	Like it's not, I'm not, it's, it's, it, that doesn't mean that I'm not doing what I do
2340520	2345320	for other people, but I always like have to check myself and go like, if there's, if there's
2345320	2351840	a person out there that's like, I mean, it's like, my mind is blown by like how, how many
2351840	2359880	people must be just absolutely fucked in the ear and, and if they're getting on Twitter
2359880	2366280	and going like, you know, in the, in the, in the, in a flurry of like people like shaming
2366280	2370440	someone for not wearing a mask when they're jogging or whatever the, whatever's happening
2370440	2374080	on Twitter, because people are engaging in their thing and they're like, you see some
2374080	2377600	of these, then these voices come up and the people that they're, you know, there's this
2377600	2383160	agenda to it where they're like, oh, it's not even, it's 99% survival of anybody.
2383160	2389400	And you, you, you, if you parse it through just them wanting one thing or another to
2389400	2393320	be true, that you could get really mad at them.
2393320	2400320	But then I think about like, Oh, what if the, what if they're just not socialized to say,
2400320	2402080	this sucks for me.
2402080	2407080	Like, which the ironic thing is like, if they would just say that and you see that all the
2407080	2411920	time in social media, when people get broken down into using their eye statements on accident,
2411920	2417560	they finally, at the end of a big fight, they start being personal and they say what their
2417560	2418560	deal is.
2418560	2422280	Oh, I'm an electrician and I was in Vietnam and I got one leg and I have a thing and it's
2422280	2424760	like, why didn't you just say that in the beginning?
2424760	2429120	And the answer is, well, because I was told that was weak.
2429120	2430720	They sometimes don't connect them.
2430720	2433560	They're like, well, yeah, my dad died three weeks ago, but that doesn't have anything
2433560	2434560	to do with this.
2434560	2435560	And you're like, Oh, it doesn't.
2435560	2436560	Yeah.
2436880	2441400	This is what's really impressive about Emily, you know, so I've like fully turtled up.
2441400	2442400	I am terrified.
2442400	2447280	Like every night still, I have dreams where I'm like, I can't find my mask, although now
2447280	2451840	every now and then there's, there's nightmares of like, when am I going to get the vaccine?
2451840	2457520	So things are looking up, but you know, when we would go on a walk, I am very guilty of
2457520	2459280	like judging people.
2459280	2461440	And I'm not saying there's a good thing who don't wear masks.
2461440	2462560	So I'm that guy.
2462560	2466720	But Emily will always like be like, well, you don't know what their day is.
2466720	2468280	You don't know what's going on with them.
2468280	2469880	So Emily's like this.
2469880	2476440	She, her empathy, it feels, she has like weaponized empathy.
2476440	2479080	She's doing it on purpose, that bitch.
2479080	2484200	It kind of feels like I'm like, I wish you weren't so empathetic because then she's like,
2484200	2488840	I just want to be angry and let me, let me have this.
2489840	2496960	I was going to get the Postmates and Cody was like, you never wear your mask and you're
2496960	2498720	going to get the Postmates.
2498720	2502080	And I'm like, oh yeah, shit.
2502080	2507240	And I like, I was like, grabbed a mask to go out to get the Postmates.
2507240	2512720	And I, I put the, I didn't have a chance to put it on because like the Postmates was already
2512720	2513720	pulling up.
2513720	2519400	And I did this thing that I thought was amazing where the guy got out of the car with the
2519400	2520400	food.
2520400	2529440	And as he was approaching me, I waved my mask at him like it was a backstage pass.
2529440	2530440	It's okay.
2530440	2535000	And took it like, I wasn't like blocking it like pie.
2535000	2537000	I was more like, I'm, I'm cool.
2537000	2538400	Like, I get it.
2538400	2543440	Like, it was like, like, I, I mean, it was, it was an unconscious move, but it definitely
2543440	2547280	wasn't an unconscious, like attempt to block the virus particles.
2547280	2550200	It was an unconscious, like, don't worry about it.
2550200	2553640	I'm I'm, I'm, I'm a mask guy.
2553640	2557120	Like I'm a, you can trust me.
2557120	2558120	Don't worry.
2558120	2559120	I own a man.
2559120	2560120	I know.
2560120	2561120	I'm friends with Ace Freelis manager.
2561120	2564320	Let me take this food and maybe cough on you.
2564320	2565320	Yeah.
2565320	2571440	No, Spencer, I have not yelled at anybody, but I have gotten close and you can because
2571440	2577000	you have a mask, but my mask actually has the lower half of my face printed on it.
2577000	2584720	So I think, but Kumail, this is interesting to me that you're, are you, so are you, are
2584720	2589160	you, are you immunocompromised in it?
2589160	2590160	I am.
2590160	2592160	And that is where this is coming from.
2592160	2598880	It's all like, it's all realizing, I don't know, this is really feels like Harmon town.
2598880	2599880	It does.
2600320	2605920	You know, obviously for a year now, Emily and I have really spent all our time together
2605920	2611200	and I feel very, very lucky that I'm with someone like Emily and honestly, our relationship
2611200	2612200	has gotten stronger.
2612200	2615480	And for the first time I've gotten some sort of insight.
2615480	2619000	People know, you know, 12 years ago, Emily had gotten really, really sick.
2619000	2621800	She was in the coma, all this stuff, but she still has that condition, right?
2621800	2623840	14 years this year, but that's okay.
2623840	2624840	14 years.
2624840	2630360	So I'm realizing that both of us have some sort of PTSD from it.
2630360	2633880	Like I don't want to like, you know, people who've been in wars and stuff, I don't want
2633880	2637720	to, but there certainly is trauma associated with it.
2637720	2645360	And we're realizing in this, that this virus is triggering certain things for me.
2645360	2648480	That make me, it's kind of a bad thing.
2648480	2653560	It sounds like I'm like ultra protective of Emily to the point where it's not healthy
2653560	2656560	for either of us.
2656560	2662560	And so this pandemic has really like awoken, awoken a lot of stuff.
2662560	2668520	And I've realized, we've realized that, you know, the work that needs to be done.
2668520	2669520	Yeah.
2669520	2670520	Yeah.
2670520	2671520	Yeah.
2671520	2677040	I mean, that's, that's, Cody is the Kumeil in this relationship because I'm immunocompromised.
2677040	2682040	I don't have the, I knew early on.
2682040	2686080	And I knew that that word was going to be like the new autistic or whatever, where it's
2686080	2689360	like, you're not, it's like people, people self-applying it.
2689360	2690880	We're going to be, I don't know.
2690880	2697880	I was like, I bet I better not tell anybody, but like, I, I'm in a category of person that
2697880	2703200	if I get this thing, like I could be one of those people that, that, you know, that, that
2703200	2704200	eats it.
2704200	2709200	And I, I'm not, one of the dyers, that's exactly what I was thinking.
2709960	2711960	I was like trying to move around his moving around.
2711960	2713960	I could be one of the dyers.
2713960	2714960	Like that's interesting.
2714960	2719440	Like what if he, if that was a quote from him, like I just realized like why he said
2719440	2720440	that.
2720440	2725760	Cause it was like, he, the narcissism wants to get around things that are bigger than
2725760	2726760	it.
2726760	2730280	Like you have to, like, you have to be anything but absorbed by something.
2730280	2738320	So he's like, I could be one of the dyers and I was like, I could be one of the people
2738440	2748640	in the category that shall we say terminates, but it's, it's, it's the truth to me per
2748640	2749640	my doctor.
2749640	2756840	It's like, I can't get this thing and I don't have the same 99% whatever chance.
2756840	2762120	And I told that to Cody early on and she's been, I mean, that's just, you know, she's
2762120	2763560	just living in this world.
2763560	2766080	She just put that in her head and is just living like that.
2766080	2770240	And the funny thing is like, ah, it's the same.
2770240	2775400	I think similar to you and Emily, because I now look at my behavior and I'm like, you
2775400	2778560	don't give a shit if you get this thing, you're just hanging out.
2778560	2784360	But now I'm remembering, like I was like researching bleaches and things I was like, do it.
2784360	2786520	I was genuinely terrified.
2786520	2790880	Cody, Cody's like trying to keep me alive.
2790880	2796680	And then I sidled into this, like, you know what, like, what is life really?
2796680	2800360	Yeah, you're, you're waving masks at postmate people.
2800360	2801360	Exactly.
2801360	2807480	Like, do you get the vaccine, do you do Emily and Dan, do you get the vaccine earlier because
2807480	2808480	of your condition?
2808480	2809480	Emily does.
2809480	2810480	Emily does.
2810480	2811480	I'm in the next year.
2811480	2812480	Yeah.
2812480	2813480	She's in the next one.
2813480	2814480	I assume you would be too, Dan.
2814480	2815480	Yeah.
2815480	2819320	I'm, Cody keeps telling me like, you can do this or that.
2819320	2823200	And I keep going, going like, I don't want the vaccine.
2823200	2824200	I just.
2824200	2825200	Why don't you want?
2825200	2830120	Well, because I keep thinking like I'm, I'm not going anywhere anyway.
2830120	2832720	The bar's not open down the street.
2832720	2833720	Fucking Kumail left.
2833720	2835640	He's so disgusted with my behavior.
2835640	2839400	That's the title.
2839400	2841320	I truly, it's so selfish.
2841320	2847000	Like, I just realized like I should be getting the vaccine for fucking Cody so she can relax.
2847000	2848000	Yeah.
2848360	2853320	Dan, Dan, you're not getting the vaccine because if you got the vaccine, people would have
2853320	2855920	to say, Dan, you have to come into work.
2855920	2857920	Well, not really.
2857920	2858920	It was more.
2858920	2862440	It's more because I honestly, a little part of me is like, I don't want to go stand in
2862440	2865600	line with a bunch of people that probably have COVID.
2865600	2870560	I another part of it is like, I didn't, I mean, I'm glad Kumail was a guest tonight
2870560	2876160	and could fill us in on the fucking like, actually just across the board vaccine is
2876160	2880680	but like, I was looking at the vaccine as being this confusing thing that was like,
2880680	2886000	I thought it was for baby boomers to like, keep them from literally dying and that was
2886000	2887000	basically it.
2887000	2891480	It was like a, like a plug at the end of the herd immunity.
2891480	2893160	No, it's for everybody.
2893160	2894160	I don't know.
2894160	2897960	I mean, you know, under a certain age, like under, like for teenagers and kids, I don't
2897960	2898960	know.
2898960	2903160	I don't know for like, for people who are pregnant or anything like that, but, but this
2903160	2907560	is, these vaccines are above and beyond what we had hoped for.
2907560	2910600	We had hoped for 70% efficacy.
2910600	2916280	These are 95% like a 95% doesn't mean that 5% of people get it.
2916280	2922600	What it means is you want, this is, oh, I'm going to divorce me again.
2922600	2931700	Um, yeah, I'll just say that, okay, so 95% efficacy doesn't mean that 5% people are open.
2931700	2935420	What happens is if people are just like, they're part of the study, so half people
2935420	2940980	get the vaccine, half people don't, the people who don't get the vaccine, 20% of them get
2940980	2941980	COVID.
2941980	2942980	So then that's the baseline.
2942980	2948260	So 95% means it's not 95% of a hundred, it's 95% of 20%.
2948260	2952780	So the number of people who get it isn't 5%, it's much smaller than that.
2952780	2954780	It's like 1%.
2954780	2960100	I think Emily and, uh, and Camille, I mean, I don't want to be like, like a Dick, but,
2960100	2964660	uh, I'm just saying, if one of you does get it, we got a sequel to big sick.
2964660	2965660	We got big sick too.
2965660	2969780	And that's going to be fucking, you guys are easy to really in a couple of meals, worried
2969780	2970780	about it.
2970780	2971780	That's the word.
2971780	2972780	It's Jeff.
2972780	2975980	Uh, don't take this the wrong way, but go fuck yourself.
2975980	2980980	Well, hopefully we'll win that Oscar.
2980980	2985820	If I get another coma, all I gotta do is get another my nightmare now.
2985820	2986820	That's great.
2986820	2987820	I'll add that.
2987820	2990100	I've given Camille a new nightmare.
2990100	2994820	Now for me, if Emily does go to another coma, Camille, you could play best fiends.
2994820	2997020	That's friends without an R best fiends.
2997020	2998020	It's a new game.
2998020	2999020	Sorry.
2999020	3001340	I just, I hear they have thousands of levels.
3001340	3002740	I've been addicted ever since they started.
3002740	3003740	They're always adding more.
3003740	3008060	I'm telling you, Trisha in marketing has been playing it and she loves taking care of her
3008060	3009060	little worm.
3009060	3015300	And it's easy enough for them to understand they're loving it more than I am.
3016300	3017300	Okay.
3017300	3020300	Rob, you may not leave the seats until that.
3020300	3023300	I'm feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling coming.
3023300	3030300	I'm going to start doing the, okay, next topic.
3030300	3036140	Uh, so I finally started, I used Warby Parker because there's a pandemic and I, I needed
3036140	3037420	new, uh, glasses.
3037420	3041500	So I got my, I need a far prescription and a close prescription.
3041500	3047300	So a pair of glasses came and I put them on and I, everything in the distance was blurry.
3047300	3050060	And then I, and everything up close was clear.
3050060	3058740	So I labeled them, uh, uh, well, it says, I labeled them close and then I realized what
3058740	3059740	are you doing?
3059740	3061740	Cause I don't know.
3061740	3071100	I don't have the words on it, but I label mine because you can't see him sometimes.
3071100	3074060	So then, and you know, Warby Parker, like they don't, they don't come all at the same
3074060	3079780	time if you need multiples and then the next ones came and I put them on and everything
3079780	3080780	was blurry.
3080780	3084460	And then I put my hand in front of my face and it was clear.
3084460	3088780	And I, I had already lost these somewhere and I was like, wait a minute.
3088780	3092580	The other ones are the far ones.
3092580	3098860	That's crazy that I labeled them close and, uh, oh my God, I got to find those and blah,
3098860	3099860	blah, blah.
3099860	3103340	They found them and then I put them on, they're the same prescription, Warby Parker sent
3103340	3107100	the same prescription for both things.
3107100	3112500	So I said to my assistant, I said, Clara, they sent the same, they sent two closes.
3112500	3117820	Uh, and she, she texted me back and said, they, they admitted their mistake.
3117820	3118820	They looked at their records.
3118820	3125420	They said, uh, that, uh, yeah, sorry, we sent you the same ones, but their records, uh,
3125420	3128700	show them as sending you two, uh, of the far ones.
3128700	3132060	I just thought it was really funny.
3132060	3133060	Sorry.
3133060	3134060	This is what you get pandemic.
3134060	3135060	Harmon town.
3135060	3138340	They were almost going to, they're like, I was sorry.
3138340	3139340	We fucked up.
3139340	3140740	We sent you two of the far ones.
3140740	3142900	No, you sent me none of the far ones.
3142900	3148700	Warby Parker, you bastards brought to you by Warby Parker.
3148700	3149700	Thanks.
3149700	3151300	Well, that's what it reminded me of.
3151300	3152300	I did the best.
3152300	3154820	I wrote best fiends down.
3154820	3155820	That was a bit.
3155820	3157820	I was like, people are like that.
3157820	3158820	That'll go.
3158820	3165180	And then that reminded me of Warby Parker and you guys, you guys know I love cereal,
3165180	3168580	but I'm getting up in the years and I can't handle that sweet stuff.
3168580	3170300	That's why I love magic spoon.
3170300	3174620	You know, they only have two net carbs and no grams of sugar, but it tastes just like
3174620	3177460	the cereal I knew and loved growing up in childhood.
3177460	3179300	They now have six flavors.
3179300	3186500	They have fruity, blueberry, cocoa, frosted, and now they have these new flavors, cinnamon
3186500	3187500	and peanut butter.
3187500	3192060	I like the peanut butter, you know, they actually ran out of peanut butter and, and, but now
3192060	3193380	it's back in print.
3193380	3194380	They print cereal.
3194380	3201060	Now use my three printed with nutrient, nutrient paste and so that is my favorite flavor of
3201060	3202060	magic spoon.
3202060	3203060	This is peanut butter.
3203060	3205980	Is this a real partnership or are you doing?
3205980	3213580	They have and blueberry and blueberry.
3213580	3218620	So, so they will, I, I, I, Camille, I think Spencer's trying to do a backdoor sponsorship
3218620	3225220	here by being so good at doing a unsolicited ad that he's going to get free magic spoon.
3225220	3229500	We love magic spoon, by the way, and we're very aware that they ran out of peanut butter.
3229500	3231500	It was the prices of this house.
3231500	3232500	Yeah.
3232500	3236740	I haven't tried it, but peanut butter is the most exciting to me.
3236740	3241700	Magic spoons early funding was all built on Nazi gold.
3241700	3245460	So you got to take, you got to take the good with the bad on that one.
3245460	3247980	I don't believe magic spoons listening.
3247980	3248980	Not Nazi gold.
3248980	3249980	I don't know.
3249980	3252460	Have you guys seen the Instagram ads for the place?
3252460	3256500	Cause I, we all know the blue aprons and the whatnots, like they deliver the meals and
3256500	3260180	the meals are kind of like, they're ready to go and, but they're ingredients and then
3260180	3262180	you put them together.
3262180	3264820	But now it like evolved into this new thing.
3264820	3271300	That's like, uh, I'm so tired of, and it's like, it's like a program where it's always
3271300	3272300	on my Instagram.
3272300	3273300	It's being advertised.
3273300	3277900	And it's just like these young people are like, I can't believe no one ever thought
3277900	3278900	of this before.
3278900	3284180	And like, it's literally just frozen dinners, like coming to their house, like, and they,
3284180	3287740	it's cause they're like, who has time to cook with blue apron?
3287740	3291540	Like, like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like George Jensen, like hitting the
3291540	3294900	button and being like, I can't believe I have to hit this, but like, it's like, I can't
3294900	3300740	believe I have to, what, what if blue apron came already prepared and it was just frozen
3300740	3305260	and you could put it in your freezer and they're advertising all of the merits of like, imagine
3305260	3309140	if they were already, and you could just put them in your freezer and then you pull them
3309140	3313100	out when you, also, also, what if it, also, what if it wasn't even frozen and it tasted
3313100	3317060	exactly like Chipotle?
3317060	3320180	I always want to comment, but I'm like, I don't want to, I'm 48 years old.
3320180	3326460	I don't want to be some asshole that's like, well, you mean, in other words, TV dinner,
3326460	3331300	like because I don't want to be like that, they're going to, I mean, you can't, you got
3331300	3333500	to be nice.
3333500	3336740	I've been coming up in their face more than ever before.
3336740	3341500	And in the pandemic, I'm just like coming up with witty retorts and, and fun little jokes
3341500	3343300	in the Facebook comments of ads.
3343300	3344300	It's great.
3344300	3351580	As a guy who, as you know, is like gorilla tweeting with a anonymous Twitter account
3351580	3357780	that has a hundred followers, like the thing that, first of all, like the joy that I never
3357780	3363580	even remembered of like, two likes, three followers, like I'm like, oh my God, no wonder
3363580	3366820	this world is fucked.
3366820	3371500	Like if you have a hundred followers on Twitter and you're nobody, like you're fucking obsessed,
3371500	3377980	like you get sucked in the, the biggest, hugest burst of hearts that I got on Twitter
3377980	3383820	was me saying some dumb ass snarky thing in response to a fucking ad.
3383820	3388340	It's a great, it was like 50 or something.
3388340	3396020	And I went, my mind exploded, like it was more like my brand's taken off.
3396020	3400620	I could be somebody one day like, yeah, you could be canceled by QAnon because you're
3400620	3401620	a pedophile.
3401620	3405660	Like it's like, it's funny to like, I'm prestige with Twitter.
3405660	3411300	Like I'm playing like level zero and I'm like, I'm like, I don't want the rocket launcher.
3411300	3416260	I want, like, I want to experience like actual Twitter where I'm, I can just like call a
3416260	3419540	hillbilly a hillbilly and I have no fucking worry about it.
3419540	3421900	I'm just like, shut up, you dumb fuck.
3421900	3422900	Dan, Dan.
3422900	3426340	Why don't you tell us all the name of that handle?
3426340	3427340	Can you tell us all?
3427340	3430620	No, no, no, TMZ.
3430620	3432020	I think Rob is struggling.
3432020	3434220	I think Rob needs to hit the head.
3434220	3436380	You can make it.
3436380	3437380	You can make it.
3437380	3438380	How much time do we have?
3438380	3439380	About now.
3439380	3441340	You got to follow your goals.
3441340	3443220	You got, you got about an hour.
3443220	3446780	Well, if we're going to Alice, then yeah, we don't have to keep going.
3446780	3448780	I mean, I don't know how long it's supposed to be.
3448780	3450740	Also, you have like a virtual background.
3450740	3452660	You could just take us into the bathroom.
3452660	3453660	I guess.
3453660	3455180	Yeah, it's not virtual.
3455900	3456900	This is a practical.
3456900	3463460	You're the guy who has the story about how you, how peeing in your pants liberated you.
3463460	3464460	You just pee.
3464460	3467620	It used to be a liberation now.
3467620	3469180	It's just every day.
3469180	3470180	Yeah.
3470180	3471180	Now it's.
3471180	3472180	Now it's.
3472180	3473180	Yeah.
3473180	3479020	How the eyesight thing is so fucked, man, like.
3479020	3480020	It's the worst.
3480020	3481020	It really is the worst.
3481020	3482020	I hate it.
3482020	3483020	Okay.
3483020	3484020	I got to read a tape measure.
3484180	3485180	Okay.
3485180	3486180	Now I can read the tape measure.
3486180	3487580	Oh, but I can't.
3487580	3488900	I don't know where I'm going.
3488900	3489900	I might.
3489900	3492820	But oh, I got to lose.
3492820	3493820	Then you lose.
3493820	3495380	Then you lose a pair.
3495380	3496380	But I try.
3496380	3499620	I tried those and that's like.
3499620	3503980	It seems crazy to have to read like this and then look at things like this.
3503980	3504980	I tried it.
3504980	3505980	Yeah.
3505980	3506980	I don't.
3506980	3508300	Did you go to an optometrist?
3508300	3511100	Do you have like a new prescription?
3511100	3512100	Yeah.
3512100	3513900	I did go.
3513900	3516100	It's the one that's the, I left the house for that.
3516100	3517300	That's since election night.
3517300	3519460	That was my own like, uh, thing.
3519460	3525980	And it's that one coming up and it's, it's, it's been, it's been controversial.
3525980	3527140	My eyes are fucked though.
3527140	3528220	I can tell they're bad.
3528220	3530580	Like I'm just like, oh, constant headache.
3530580	3533100	Probably need to get those eyes checked.
3533100	3538540	We've really moved, we've, we've, I've, she's made an appointment and I've been a tyrant
3538540	3541100	and made her reschedule it.
3541100	3543180	And then now it's happening next week.
3543180	3544820	And I just remembered that.
3544820	3548620	And uh, big six two is going to be a big hit.
3548620	3550220	I'm sorry.
3550220	3554540	What is the implication there?
3554540	3555540	Don't go.
3555540	3557780	Don't go to the optometrist.
3557780	3560300	You guys know Randall park, right?
3560300	3561300	Yeah.
3561300	3566500	See, you, you, you, you know, he has it and I'm not, I don't, I don't want to, I'm going
3566500	3569900	to, I'm going to leave out details so that he doesn't end up, his personal life doesn't
3569900	3571260	end up getting affected by this.
3571260	3578500	But I think it's like he's, he has a twin brother that works at a optometry place.
3578500	3580140	Are you sure they're twins?
3580140	3581140	Are you sure?
3581140	3582140	Are you sure?
3582140	3583140	They were twins.
3583140	3584140	Yeah.
3584140	3585140	Okay.
3585140	3586140	Do you think he just had the second job?
3586140	3587140	Is that what you mean?
3587140	3592220	Because the, because the joke was that like, he, he was like, he, he was working at this
3592220	3597820	place and then he was like, and I was like, God damn, this dude looks and sounds like
3597820	3598820	Randall park.
3598860	3600500	And he just randomly saw him.
3600500	3601500	Yeah.
3601500	3602500	Oh my God.
3602500	3604380	And then he was like, are you Dan Harmon?
3604380	3608740	And I was like, wait a minute, what the fuck is going on?
3608740	3613300	And it was like, I think, you know, my, my brother and it was like, wait a minute.
3613300	3614660	He's like, it's my twin brother.
3614660	3615660	And I blurted out.
3615660	3617660	I was like, I thought I was racist.
3617660	3620620	And he was like, you're not racist.
3620620	3628700	I go to the same optometrist and he tells me that story every time I go in about how Dan
3628700	3631140	Harmon was so relieved, he wasn't racist.
3631140	3635220	I thought that was, to me, that's like a funny thing that you couldn't even write that because
3635220	3640300	we were like, I remember it as us like leaping up and down, like, like, as if one of us won
3640300	3645020	the lottery and me going, I thought I was racist.
3645020	3647060	And he's like, you're not racist.
3647060	3648060	And it was like funny.
3648060	3654140	That's going to be strange now that he's on one division and like everybody in the world
3654140	3656940	is watching it and they're just like, are you researching for a role?
3656940	3657940	What's going on?
3657940	3668100	I was going to say something stupid, but it has to do with eyesight.
3668100	3671560	When I went there the last time, Dan, did you do this?
3671560	3675820	Not the last time, but like a couple of times ago, they put these drops in your eyes and
3675820	3676980	I was like, what's that for?
3676980	3681100	Well, that'll make you not blink for like an hour.
3681100	3686820	And I'm like, so for an hour, you're like, yeah, yeah, okay, all right.
3686820	3688220	And I go home like that.
3688220	3689620	Do you want tacos?
3689620	3693020	Well, because they take some kind of thing and they're like pushing it up against your
3693020	3694020	eye, right?
3694020	3700220	Because they want to like, yeah, yeah, it makes you not want to blink or not be able
3700220	3701220	to blink.
3701220	3702220	Not be able to blink.
3702220	3706860	So your eyes are like this and you're like, hey, not true, Rob.
3706860	3707860	This is amazing.
3707860	3708860	That stuff.
3708860	3709860	Yeah.
3709860	3710860	I'm kind of tired.
3710860	3711860	I think I'll go to bed.
3712860	3717820	That's just crazy to me that we're reading this book is making me sleepy.
3717820	3725300	We have these balls of gelatin in our skulls and they're melting from birth until death.
3725300	3730900	And like, because they're melting, they're they're becoming less than perfectly spherical.
3730900	3735380	And we go to these people and they like, oh, all right, what does that look better than
3735380	3736380	that?
3736380	3737380	Is that like better than that?
3737380	3742460	Oh, I noticed like now the human element is all just follow up.
3742460	3748380	It's like we're entering the concierge phase is that that anthropology guy that wrote those
3748380	3754020	books would say like pretty soon I don't know if they're going to need a human being there
3754020	3760380	because they they're kind of like the computer is zeroing in on what my prescription should
3760380	3761380	be.
3761380	3764100	I don't even know how the fuck that's possible, but that's what's happening.
3764100	3768780	And because the guy that was there like running through the lenses was like, and I'll just
3768780	3772100	make sure now it was like he's working.
3772100	3773100	It's like Turner.
3773100	3774100	He's working for the computer.
3774100	3780100	Yeah, he's like he's partners with a computer like and it's making it's making his job more
3780100	3781100	fun.
3781100	3787180	They're solving cases, but yeah, I but the weirdest thing about it is that then he said
3787180	3794060	to me like, well, good news, yeah, your prescription could use a little tweaking.
3794060	3797180	Yes, your vision is deteriorating.
3797180	3803180	It's deteriorating the amount that it's supposed to in this amount of time.
3803180	3808020	And given your age and all these other statistics, like it'll plateau at a certain point.
3808020	3814380	Like they just them knowing it's like your eyes are like ice cubes like or like ice sculptures
3814380	3815380	at a party.
3815380	3819700	And they're just sort of like, yeah, the tips of the wings on the swan are like, they should
3819700	3822180	be pretty much flippers by now.
3822180	3825860	But you know, the wedding receptions already started.
3825860	3831340	It's like no one cares like like your eyes are just melting in your head.
3831340	3834060	It depreciates as soon as you drive it off the lot.
3834060	3839620	There is no you can sell this to anybody for sure.
3840620	3842100	Turn a profit.
3842100	3846300	No, I thought I would.
3846300	3853140	I went to one of those laser eye places where you go in there and they're like, they fix
3853140	3858820	your they just to see because my eyes are getting fucked up, you know, like but it used
3858820	3863540	to be that I can't see what's in front of me, but I can see really good be far away.
3863540	3867620	But now I can't see far away or what's without my glasses.
3867620	3872380	So I went to this doctor and it's like, oh, what they do is they slice the top of your
3872380	3877540	eyelid, your eye, not your eyelid, your eye open, and then they kind of clean that with
3877540	3881380	a q tip and then they melt it back on or whatever.
3881380	3883100	But people have said, oh, it's great.
3883100	3884100	You should do it.
3884100	3890700	I go in there and the guys like, yeah, your eyes are are like it's the you could we could
3890700	3897200	do like one far away and any other would be for close up.
3897200	3899280	So you would be like doing this all the time.
3899280	3903680	And I was like, that doesn't seem like a real good use of my time.
3903680	3904680	And I got.
3904680	3910120	So you'd have like a book reading eye and then I'd be like like right now I'd be like,
3910120	3911960	hey, guys, what's up?
3911960	3913840	Actually, I like this for you.
3913840	3916720	I think this is hey, hey, it's working.
3916720	3918440	It makes you ask.
3918440	3923720	You've got to ask feel about, you know, yes, I loved you on Searching for Italy.
3923720	3924720	Fantastic.
3924720	3933600	I used to know why the iconic pirate eye patch thing was not because they had lost
3933600	3937880	an eye in battle, but because if you keep one eye in darkness and you use that eye when
3937880	3941800	you're above deck, but if you have to go below deck for any reason where it's dark, you use
3941800	3944240	that eye and you have perfect vision with that.
3944240	3948400	Yes, you know, the most interesting useless shit always.
3948400	3952600	That's the same thing with like, it's called myth busters.
3952600	3955080	It's called myth busters.
3955080	3961720	They give one leg a peg and then the other one is like normal.
3961720	3968880	So when they have to run, well, it turns out like if you're making people walk the plank
3968880	3973240	and you have a peg leg, it's a lot easier to get them to walk the plank because they're
3973240	3976320	like you poke poke poke poke poke poke poke.
3976320	3977320	Also, yeah.
3977320	3979640	And that's the reason why they only have one parrot.
3979640	3981760	They only wear one parrot on one shoulder.
3981760	3984400	And that's something the other shoulder never needs crackers.
3984400	3989760	I mean, I forget what the actual reason was, but then with pirates, there was always a
3989760	3990760	reason.
3990760	3991760	Always a reason.
3991760	3992760	Everything was efficient.
3992760	4001440	A pirate actually always had a parrot on each shoulder.
4001440	4007720	Their skeletons, when we dig them up, it appears as though they only had one because people
4007720	4009680	die on their side.
4009680	4010680	People die on their side.
4010800	4014720	The upper parrot is exposed to oxidation.
4015920	4018120	Dan, that theory has been debunked.
4018120	4019720	The reason why they wore one.
4019720	4024440	Oh, I'm trying to trick us with a steely twitchy.
4027720	4029960	He has reason to touchy press.
4031960	4037000	He's a trick in the book.
4041680	4043640	He's taken a touchy pee, everybody.
4048360	4050560	He forgot to turn the screen off.
4052000	4056040	It looks like he's being overtaken by the fucking death stranding.
4056240	4057240	Yes. Wow.
4058640	4061440	He went from he went from cheapy peepy to touchy peepy.
4062320	4063320	Touchy peepy.
4064120	4065120	Touchy peepy.
4066040	4069120	Hashtag everybody hashtag touchy peepy tonight.
4069120	4070160	That's going to be trending.
4073000	4073960	That's amazing.
4074960	4079840	I do love his I do love his CNN travel show because I don't love all travel shows.
4080080	4083400	I'm so envious of anybody that gets to go travel and eat good food.
4083680	4085160	And Stanley touchy is very charming.
4085160	4087960	I kind of enjoy him walking around and eating a pizza.
4087960	4090840	And you go, oh, I would like to have that pizza with Stanley touchy.
4091480	4093120	Well, I don't know, man.

4108760	4109920	I was eyes.
4109920	4114160	Can I did you know that your eyes don't grow the size when you're a boy
4114160	4116760	and your eyes are the size that they are for the rest of your life?
4116760	4118160	But the fuck.

4147920	4149560	It's disrespectful to the audience.
4149560	4154120	I got distracted because I was like, oh, man, if I if I put an image of Randy
4154120	4156880	Quaid like up and then I like.
4156880	4161600	Yeah, I can do a call back where I like slip out and put up a Randy Quaid.
4162160	4165800	I'm not going to do it because it was taking me away from the shape of show.
4167040	4169400	I don't write ourselves on here.
4169400	4172360	I didn't get a single bit of love for for Laura.
4172760	4178000	I commissioned this after Kumail and Emily had talked about him being captain party.
4178160	4179400	I was doing this for a long time.

4238960	4241480	I watched it two nights ago because TCM had it on again.
4242400	4244000	So good. I so good.
4244000	4247320	Right before right before you ask that, I just reference Judy Garland
4247320	4248920	from Meet Me in St. Louis.
4248920	4251200	And I don't think anybody maybe Emily knew what it was.
4251200	4251880	Clank, clank, clank.
4251880	4253320	Went the trolley. Yes, yes.
4253320	4255400	Yeah. So do I know musicals?
4255400	4260320	Yes, I I I'm gay, but I make them straight, but I make no case for it.
4260760	4261840	So what should we watch?
4261840	4263080	We've seen so far.
4263080	4264920	What are the best ones we've seen?
4265480	4266280	We start singing.
4266280	4267960	You start off with.
4267960	4269480	OK, what else?
4270480	4272760	The on the town, I was going to be like,
4272760	4276280	what's the one where they're out on the town that I remember?
4276280	4279400	On the town is my is not my favorite one of that kind.
4279400	4281200	Anchors away. Have you seen that one?
4281200	4282920	No, that's one that has Jerry in it.
4282920	4285400	Right. The little cartoon mouse.
4285400	4287320	Yeah, because Gene Kelly dances with Jerry the mouse.
4287320	4289960	And that's that's Jean and Frank.
4289960	4292160	And I'm blanking on the other characters.
4292160	4293960	That one's a good one.
4294680	4298840	Oh, also, guys, have you seen have you seen Cabaret?
4299920	4302040	No, we really want to see Cabaret.
4302560	4304480	Start with Captain.
4304480	4305640	Start with Cabaret.
4305640	4307040	It is absolutely a freak out.
4307040	4309320	There's Nazis, there's lesbians, there's menage a trois.
4310160	4313960	I about a year and a half ago took acid by myself.
4313960	4317400	By the way, a lot of musicals have Nazis in them for some reason.
4317400	4320480	But sorry, for some reason.
4321080	4326600	Springtime for Hitler and Germany,
4327320	4332280	you took I took a small dose of acid on my own because somebody
4332280	4336360	had given me some acid and I've only ever done acid in small quantities.
4336360	4338480	I've never gone like on a huge trip.
4338680	4342680	I I won't say I recommend it because I don't want to push,
4343120	4344920	you know, drug use on the children,
4344920	4347800	as I know a lot of our viewers are youngins.
4348440	4354240	However, if you have the opportunity, do a little acid and watch Cabaret.
4354240	4357040	It's a fucking freak out.
4357040	4359320	I had to hit pause after the opening number.
4359320	4363120	I'm like, this movie lives inside my brain for the rest of my life.
4363120	4364600	It's very, very good.
4364600	4365240	I want that.
4365240	4369800	We we tried watching one last night that Rob mentioned a lot
4370040	4371480	called All That Jazz.
4371480	4375720	And it's a movie directed by Bob Fosse about the life of Bob Fosse.
4375720	4378080	And the whole movie is about women trying to fuck him.
4378320	4382480	And his biggest problem is all women want to do is fuck him.
4383560	4385880	And he wrote is a kid when he's an adult.
4385920	4386720	Doesn't matter.
4386720	4388160	That's right. Yeah.
4388160	4390680	I was going to recommend that as an anti musical.
4390680	4391760	And that's a real goodie.
4391760	4393520	And Roy Scheider is tremendous in it.
4393520	4396520	And it's there's more drug use in that than most movies have.
4397000	4400160	And also, if you want to go also on a weird anti musical trip,
4400600	4403600	Penny's From Heaven with Steve Martin, Bernadette Peters
4403880	4407800	and Christopher Walken does a tap routine strip tease that is worth watching.
4408400	4411200	What is it? It's a very dark.
4411200	4414600	It's like it's not supposed to be musicals are supposed to be uplifting
4414600	4416640	and upbeat and everybody wins.
4416640	4420600	These are depressing where everybody is, you know, like basically
4420600	4422600	we're all decaying, all dying.
4422600	4424800	Penny's From Heaven takes place.
4424800	4427120	I'm going to save that for post vaccine.
4427120	4432840	The Fosse Vernon miniseries with Sam Rockwell is really good.
4432840	4438480	I mean, I guess if you were into like all that jazz or or or like cabaret
4438480	4440600	or anything like that, he shows like the making of it.
4440720	4442920	And they're really, really it's really great.
4442920	4444960	It's really cool in anchors away.
4444960	4446960	There is a scene that I've watched a million times.
4447400	4452760	Gene Kelly dances with a peasant Mexican girl in Alvera Street.
4452760	4455320	And he thinks that he's lost his girl to Frank Sinatra.
4455560	4457480	He doesn't know that it's not the case.
4457480	4459640	He thinks he's losing the girl to his friend.
4459640	4461040	And he's like, you know what?
4461040	4462280	Good for him.
4462280	4463560	And he's heartbroken.
4463560	4466680	And he sees a little peasant girl played not by a Mexican girl.
4466680	4468520	It's actually a little white girl in dark makeup.
4468520	4472440	But they do a dance where he says, you know, I can't have her.
4472440	4474400	So I'll I'll dance with this child.
4474680	4476000	That song makes me cry.
4476000	4478240	That number makes me cry every time.
4478240	4479600	It's just good.
4479600	4481920	OK, that's next then. Yeah.
4481920	4486360	And also we all do anything for Fred and Ginger musicals are always good.
4486800	4489400	Like, yeah, get up on those.
4490040	4491440	Get up on the swing time.
4491440	4495000	Hi. We we watched Viva Las Vegas.
4495000	4497280	I don't know about the musical, but that was a ton of fun.
4498160	4500400	I don't know that Elvis.
4501600	4503480	Oh, Viva Las Vegas.
4503480	4505400	That movie is fucking weird.
4505400	4509040	Yeah, that movie ends with a car crash where at least four people are murdered.
4509240	4512360	And then they just start singing.
4512400	4514760	And it's like, no, there's the race.
4514760	4517080	And it was absolute a bloodbath.
4517080	4519640	There is in the car race.
4519640	4522880	And Margaret is in short shorts and pantyhose.
4523080	4525120	And Elvis, I think is too. It's pretty hot.
4525600	4528200	I got to I got to I got to correct you there.
4528800	4530360	She's not wearing short shorts.
4530360	4533080	She's just wearing pantyhose as fucking pants.
4533280	4534480	That's right.
4534480	4536640	Black number. Yeah.
4536640	4541200	She's just hanging out in a sweater and pantyhose.
4541320	4542520	She had to get on set.
4542520	4544560	They had a skirt, but she was like, I got to go.
4544560	4546240	I got to go. It's starting.
4546240	4548560	And then she has like crazy dancing style.
4548560	4551520	And like, like, like, yeah, she's just like on fire.
4551680	4556400	Yeah. Those those movies are like, I mean, well, that movie anyway.
4556400	4558240	I just maybe it's not true of all that.
4558240	4561600	I haven't seen Clam Bake, but I like.
4562000	4564400	I mean, Clam. Do the Clam.
4564400	4565240	It's interesting.
4565240	4570680	Some of these movies are like garbage, but like how many other elements
4570680	4575080	other than the things that make a movie garbage, if they're all slid up to 10,
4575200	4576480	can the movie be good?
4576480	4580320	Like I've got that affection for Xanadu because I'm like,
4580800	4585800	like everything about Xanadu, like it seems determined to make this movie bad.
4585800	4590120	Like it doesn't have all these fundamental things that a movie is supposed to have.
4590120	4594080	But then it has all of these like it's just like all these other dials
4594080	4595800	have been turned up to 10.
4597440	4598480	Yeah, I like.
4598480	4600800	That's exactly what Viva Las Vegas is.
4600800	4604080	You're like, this is not a good movie, but I'm having a blast watching it.
4604800	4607800	Viva Las Vegas reminds me a lot of Xanadu because they're because
4607800	4611560	and I wouldn't doubt that there was like a lot of influence there
4611840	4616480	because there's the there's the montage that represents Ann Margaret
4616480	4618960	and Elvis falling in love.
4619320	4623920	And it's like a montage of like that involves teleportation, time travel.
4624200	4628120	Like they're just like they're just like cowboys.
4628120	4631480	And yes, oh, well, let's just spend the day together.
4631720	4637200	And like all of a sudden they're like shooting each other in an old west town
4637400	4639160	and there's no explanation for it.
4639160	4643680	And it's very much like in Xanadu when it's like they have a thin justification
4643680	4646760	for it where it's like, oh, I'm getting to know you and like let's rollerskate
4646760	4651120	through this place where records are made, which of course involves
4651120	4653760	like all of the you can hit a button and these things will come down
4653760	4656280	and blow fog at you and then you'll turn into a cartoon bird.
4657720	4660360	It just goes to show you it doesn't fucking matter.
4661320	4664920	The kind of in and out of like like we don't hold.
4665000	4669640	Well, wait a minute. Why are they falling in love like like like movies
4669640	4672680	that movies that hold themselves to an internal logic
4673040	4677880	only insult us by trying to make it about their playlists on Spotify.
4678240	4682200	They're like the 90s version of that where they're like, you like the pixies.
4682360	4684120	I like the pixies.
4684120	4687760	And then it's like, oh, so that's supposed to make me believe
4687760	4689920	that you'd take a bullet for her.
4689920	4692760	That's your version.
4692760	4696040	But then before that, it was just like, oh, well, we're dancing, you know,
4696040	4697280	and that's like, I don't know.
4697280	4701760	We're not going to bother trying to show you logically why it is
4701760	4703960	that you love this person.
4703960	4707680	We're going to actually just express the feelings that you have
4709120	4710720	when you love that person.
4716720	4719280	Oh, really important.
4720280	4722360	Garbage. Just what happened?
4722880	4724160	What was that?
4724160	4727800	I think, Dan, I mean this with all fondness.
4728040	4731920	This is taking me back to meltdown comics because there's that moment when
4732960	4735520	like you would have already had a couple of kennel ones before the show.
4735520	4739160	But then there's that threshold where you get into complete
4739160	4743320	like downhill skiing mode where it's my favorite part of the show.
4743800	4745440	Here's a topic.
4745440	4747160	This is the last topic that I wrote down.
4747160	4749200	It doesn't mean that this is a thing.
4749200	4753680	But my my beautiful niece,
4753680	4757640	I think she's for my niece to be whatever the niece of my fiance.
4758960	4761240	She's she's in this phase.
4761240	4762680	She's been in it for a while.
4762680	4763760	She loves dancing.
4763760	4765120	She loves singing.
4765120	4766600	She just performs.
4766600	4770680	Sometimes she steals her mom's camera and she makes like little videos of herself.
4770680	4774840	Sometimes mom is participating and mom's like filming the videos.
4775120	4778160	We'll get the videos.
4778160	4781520	And she'll be like dancing around and then
4783840	4788760	she'll say at the end of it, like if things don't go in her mind perfectly
4788760	4790280	because, you know, she's four.
4790280	4794440	So she's she's got some kind of job to do in her head.
4794680	4798160	And I guess that's the thing that's fascinating to me is that it like like
4798520	4802800	she'll do like there'll be this video of her like jumping around the living room,
4802840	4806680	singing and dancing gibberish, doing like this stuff.
4806680	4809000	It's just it's just joyful.
4809000	4813320	And then at the end of it, she'll like go toward the camera.
4814440	4817280	If her mom's holding it and be like, delete it.
4818960	4821320	She has this like impulse in her.
4822120	4825960	That's like and we were just puzzling over that.
4825960	4828040	We're just like, I was like, wait, why delete it?
4828040	4829800	Like, what did she think she did wrong there?
4829800	4835880	She's four like like and I'm just kind of and I'm not like
4835920	4838200	I was thinking about it today and it was like
4839440	4841280	it not being cynical about it.
4841280	4845040	I think it's an uplifting thing because I don't think that that's congenital.
4845040	4848840	I don't think that human beings are born with shame.
4848840	4851560	I think that human beings are born with a
4852800	4855360	like a desire to get everything right.
4855880	4860480	And and then we're like constantly monitoring
4860520	4864760	the grown ups around us for cues about because one thing
4864760	4868520	Cody pointed out and Cody's 12 years younger than me, but she and I both agreed
4868520	4873400	like delete it is not in your vocabulary like when we were kids.
4874000	4878240	There's nothing to delete like God, you know,
4880120	4883720	God willing, something that you could do would be forever,
4883880	4888920	whether it's your little handprint in cement or when VHS camcorders came out
4888920	4891840	and it was just like we would watch three hours of ourselves
4892320	4894040	like rolling around in the grass.
4894040	4895440	There was no input.
4895440	4899440	There was never back then it was like, erase that, erase that.
4899840	4902840	And now there is four four year olds,
4903320	4907080	which I think is so interesting and not in a cynical way.
4907080	4911120	Again, I think they're picking up on this idea that like, well,
4911240	4915840	they know that information is now there's a surplus of it.
4915960	4921840	And they're like, no, no, no, no, no. Delete that like they're curating it.
4922160	4924200	Yeah, she's like, she's like, don't.
4924200	4926680	But I was just trying to figure out what she meant.
4926680	4930200	And so I think for her, it might have is like, I think she might have gotten
4930200	4933640	a reaction from her mom that maybe because she did like a little thing,
4933640	4935280	you know, like four year olds will do.
4935280	4940640	She like, she like put her sleeve off her shoulder at the end of her dance.
4940640	4944280	And her mom had this reaction that was understandably it was a gasp
4944400	4948920	because it was like, yeah, fuck, what is that?
4949160	4954040	And I think that she interpreted that reaction from her mom
4954760	4958120	in the very moment was like, you touched a hot stove,
4958120	4963040	you stood at the top of stairs, you didn't use it like delete it, maybe.
4963880	4968440	Because then there's another video that is like where her older brother
4968440	4972400	is like doing a performance and then the little sister comes in
4972960	4977440	and interrupts it like she steals the spotlight and he goes, delete it.
4978440	4980560	I understand that that's a tantrum.
4980560	4981480	That's Orson Welles.
4981480	4984600	He's going like, I'm trying to make something perfect here
4984600	4987280	and now you may as well throw it away.
4987280	4988720	That looks like delete it.
4988720	4992240	He was saying delete it like, you know, I hate my sister.
4992240	4997440	Like, like, I can't believe she came in and ruined my masterpiece that I.
4997440	5000960	And I was like, oh, I would get that if I was like,
5001760	5004680	you would you would wield the delete it the same way you would say like,
5004840	5008960	OK, I don't want a fire truck then or like, you know, like throwing it across the room.
5009680	5015280	But I like it just like I don't think that we need to get over our shame.
5015280	5019880	I think that we need to accept it and realize that we have it
5020200	5023920	like and we're putting it into our children and like like like she
5023920	5027680	doesn't know what's right or wrong yet, but she already knows
5027680	5031080	that there's such a thing is what's going on over here.
5031840	5033880	What? What do you mean?
5033880	5036320	OK, no, I'm not.
5036320	5038600	You finished it, but half of it's in the toilet.
5038600	5040440	It doesn't count. It's not astounding.
5040440	5042560	You got to start over. Yeah.
5042560	5046320	I kind of feel like there's like the developmental stage of a kid
5046320	5050760	at that age kind of thinks, oh, everyone knows this routine I came up with.
5050760	5053000	So they all realize that I fucked it up.
5053000	5055040	Like, everyone knows I fucked up this routine.
5055040	5059240	Whereas to you, it looks like a random thing that she's like free.
5059240	5062240	Right. But like, so you think that she thought that other kids,
5062240	5063960	I guess I don't know her.
5063960	5066680	I don't know. Yeah, I don't I don't have enough information
5066680	5071000	about who she thinks is going to see the video and even just like, yeah,
5071000	5073520	everyone knows, like everyone knows I messed up that one step.
5073520	5076000	So now we have to like do this again. I have to delete it.
5076000	5079080	But really, like, nobody knows you're just flailing. You're a child.
5081880	5085560	Part of me thinks that like, I truly think that like the big
5085960	5089160	I think she's so young that I think that
5090000	5092040	and this is total speculation.
5092040	5096360	But I think that the the the primary way of her
5096360	5099800	enjoying those videos is that she watches them back with her mom.
5100440	5104640	And I think and I think she has an impulse embedded in her.
5104880	5108000	That's like, get rid of the bad one.
5108000	5110560	I don't want to watch that one with you again.
5110560	5113560	I don't want to witness it with you kind of thing.
5114120	5116840	But that's just me simplifying something
5116840	5119840	because from my view, her life is simple.
5119840	5123880	Like you said, she could have a whole fucking she's got a master plan.
5123880	5127320	She's got a whole she's got a whole civilization in her world.
5127320	5131360	Like she's got best friends. And yeah, I didn't thought about that, honestly.
5131360	5132720	Like, I don't know, four year olds.
5132720	5135400	Like, do they know they don't have phones?
5135400	5140360	But do they do they do their videos get like circulated among their?
5140800	5142720	Oh, God, that's such a scary thought.
5142720	5144640	That's that's a horrifying thought.
5144640	5147480	I don't like like it's like I'm friends with your mom
5147480	5149440	and your mom texted this video of me.
5149440	5155040	Uh-huh. Well, we get we get we get videos of like your friends,
5155040	5157360	like daughter singing and stuff.
5157360	5161520	We do. Yeah, but she's like eight, nine.
5161520	5163440	Like she's a little bit older. Yeah.
5163440	5166400	Well, now, but we've been getting them for years for many years.
5166400	5169160	That's right. There was this great moment where.
5169200	5171160	So can I can I talk about this?
5171160	5173320	Yeah, just don't use it in games.
5173320	5175280	She was a lot younger. She's five years old.
5175280	5177240	And she's got like us.
5177240	5178080	She's got how would you?
5178080	5179960	It's Benicio del Toro. Sorry.
5179960	5181240	It's the cousin, right?
5181240	5183360	So it's two little girls, right?
5183360	5186440	So they're both going to improvise songs and then making a video.
5186720	5189280	And the first girl sings and they're both five.
5189280	5191880	Like we know these kids and she's singing.
5191880	5192920	She makes up a song.
5192920	5197520	She's like a leaf, a tree, a horse.
5197520	5198800	And it's this beautiful song.
5198800	5201320	And then it goes to the and then it goes to the
5201320	5204840	and then it goes to the other girl and she's four years old.
5205160	5207240	And she she hears that, but she sings.
5207240	5211360	I am going to kill myself.
5216400	5218120	Everybody just loses it.
5218120	5221320	Everybody in the room is like, whoa.
5221320	5225720	Yeah. All the girls are like, no.
5225720	5227200	It's one of my favorite videos.
5227200	5229000	I watch it maybe once in my life.
5229000	5230480	So many times.
5230480	5234280	Because when you watch it, it's the beautiful moment right before she thinks
5234280	5237080	where that hasn't happened to the adults in the room yet.
5237560	5239480	Like you see it.
5239480	5242600	And then the other kid starts being like, I didn't tell her to say that.
5242600	5244760	That was her song. I had nothing to do with it.
5247280	5250520	It's insane to me that our perception of children is that we're waiting
5250520	5253680	for them to let us know like what's going on in their heads.
5254240	5257680	And sort of like we do perceive them as like receiving instruction from us,
5257680	5260680	but not on the level that we really are instructing them
5261280	5266120	and not understanding that the entire time that all they're doing is going.
5266160	5268920	They're monitoring us and going like, I don't know.
5268920	5270720	What do you want for dinner?
5270720	5276680	Like it's like and then they like we're all like we're just going like
5277280	5278880	we where did you come up with that?
5278880	5281920	Why did you just like come into the room and talk and say that
5281920	5285960	like weird Frasier thing where it indicates
5285960	5289160	that you're upset with us and you're being passive aggressive.
5289160	5291280	Like you're sending all these social cues.
5291280	5294600	But all they're doing is like studying our eyebrows and our tone of voice.
5294600	5298880	And they're just they just have these like giant little spongy brains
5298880	5302800	that are like they're just throbbing and going like, am I a Spartan?
5302800	5306400	Am I a Greek? Am I am I an Eskimo?
5306400	5309360	Like like you tell me what culture I'm living in
5309360	5313240	and what set of behaviors is going to impress you guys and I'll fucking do it.
5313600	5317520	And they're just like mashing it buttons and then we react to them.
5317520	5319200	We go like, whoa.
5319200	5324480	And then sometimes us reacting like that triggers shame for them.
5324920	5328160	Sometimes it makes them go, oh, I shouldn't have done that.
5328200	5332040	And sometimes it like hits their dopamine spike and they go like,
5332600	5334600	oh, I'm going to be a DJ.
5334600	5336880	Like I just did this thing right.
5336920	5340320	Like I want to be a superstar. I want to blow minds.
5341040	5343560	I feel like I can reach back in my memory
5343560	5347720	and along those behavioral patterns and go like I learned very quickly.
5347720	5351640	Like my parents' opinion of what I was doing
5351640	5354960	meant jack shit compared to company.
5355320	5362320	Like if people are coming over, if I can get them to react in any way,
5362760	5368520	my parents are going to be dragged along like like whether they like it or not.
5368520	5372520	They're going to be like Sony and the company is the Nielsen's.
5372520	5374520	Like it's just like, well, I don't get it.
5374520	5377480	And we told them we don't get it in development, but God damn it.
5377480	5378920	Now it's a hit.
5378920	5383760	And like I I feel like I have emotional memories of that experience.
5383760	5389560	And I think it's crazy that along with that comes like people are saying
5389880	5394160	delete it, a four year old going, delete it, delete that one.
5394160	5397160	That one of me stumbling around like a goofball,
5397760	5402040	something that when I'm 30, I would I would just drink like nectar
5402040	5406560	because I'll only have so much time and like I'll see baby videos of myself.
5406560	5412360	And I'll be like, oh, my God, you deleted any of them that for she's like going,
5412360	5417680	no, burn it, put it to send it to the incinerator, cut print that one.
5417680	5418760	No, delete it.
5418760	5422280	Like I won't have anyone see that one. That's not what happened.
5422880	5428640	But I don't even know if they have the same relationship with stuff being permanent.
5428640	5433080	Like to me, like I didn't I never even saw a camcorder till I was a teenager.
5433080	5435800	So I didn't even like think about that being a possibility.
5435800	5439840	But to grow up with the knowledge that like it could all just like exist forever
5439840	5442920	or maybe not. Maybe it doesn't even mean the same thing to them.
5443000	5446720	Do you know what I mean? Like that's what I'm kind of struggling with.
5446720	5449680	Like, you know, by delete it, does she mean
5450560	5454440	before it ends up on Facebook and gets me canceled or does she mean
5455880	5458320	I don't want that to be part of Goodnight Moon?
5458320	5460600	I don't I don't want that to be canon.
5460600	5462760	Oh, yeah, that's right.
5463280	5465800	I think it's the latter. I think that's what I think.
5465800	5468480	I think it's the same. It's like.
5468480	5473160	I think the kids these days hate getting canceled and their shit's super aware.
5475160	5477280	Yeah, four year olds hate cancel culture.
5479960	5482680	I want to I want to show, you know, in this pandemic,
5482680	5484960	there's been in the beginning quarantine.
5484960	5487440	I was very, very stressed out and things were.
5487480	5489680	Is it OK if I change the subject?
5489680	5492040	Yeah, no, I mean, I think we've. Yeah.
5494280	5499840	And so I'm like very grateful to the things that have like helped us get through it.
5500160	5504880	And one of them, Rob knows this, is found crap that you make.
5504880	5507520	It brought us so much joy.
5507520	5509520	And I think you would watch.
5509520	5511280	We've been watching this all quarantine.
5511280	5515920	And I felt so much like genuine, like gratitude watching this.
5516280	5519200	It's like so full of joy and fun.
5519200	5521720	So so I want to tell people if you can.
5521960	5523960	Are they available anywhere, Rob?
5523960	5526320	No, I've been doing them just live.
5526360	5527600	You know, it's kind of like a one.
5527600	5531000	I'll do repeats every once in a while, but I'll just be like
5531480	5535600	tune in at five thirty tribe home video dot com.
5535600	5537480	And I'll show something.
5537480	5541240	Cali's been opening the show with just playing music and Spencer
5541240	5543200	and Jeff have kind of interviewed her.
5543200	5547360	And then we roll into clips like like what Harmon and I used to do
5547360	5550840	at Cine family at the theater there.
5550840	5554240	And then and then we do an unpack the crap where we talk about the clips
5554440	5556560	because people want to go, where's that clip from?
5556560	5557880	And then we talk about like that.
5557880	5559520	It's so good.
5559520	5561280	People watch him whenever whenever.
5561280	5564440	I'm pretty much doing it just for you to know.
5564440	5567440	We love that so much.
5567440	5570560	We're like, whatever, you know, whatever I get, get that text.
5570560	5572600	I'm like, so excited.
5573200	5575560	Emily and Camille, because I don't watch a lot of stuff.
5575560	5577080	I watch. I watch TCM.
5577080	5579000	I watch old movies mostly.
5579000	5581800	And I watch them the same movies 100 times over.
5582320	5584400	Give me something that I should be watching, something new
5584400	5586520	that you think that I might I might dig.
5586960	5590560	Oh, oh, that's we've watched
5591200	5592200	so much stuff.
5592200	5594360	It's a little overwhelming.
5594480	5597600	Uh, something new, Emily, what do we want?
5599560	5601120	It's hard.
5601120	5604320	Well, think, think about it, because I just bored the audience to pieces
5604320	5605560	about my love of musicals.
5605560	5609520	So if you guys have a TV or that was very exciting to me.
5610240	5611960	Also, documentaries, I love it.
5611960	5614200	It's a documentary I haven't seen laid on me.
5615600	5618600	I feel like all the documentaries are now is like murder.
5619200	5621880	It's probably the husband, but maybe not.
5621880	5623560	But it is always the husband.
5623560	5625760	Yeah, usually it's all true crime docs now.
5625760	5628400	I don't I don't I haven't seen any that are not true crime.
5628400	5630680	I think Michael Jordan one was good.
5630680	5632240	And I don't like that was good.
5632240	5636400	Yeah, yeah, I don't think I don't think you have to like sports at all
5636400	5638600	to like that documentary, because it's just it's just about
5640080	5643240	like just a bunch of crazy circumstances and characters.
5643560	5646800	I just started the girl in the dale.
5646800	5650800	What's that? The lady in the veil, the lady in the dale.
5650800	5652160	And it's fascinating.
5652160	5654120	Have you made it all the way through that one?
5654120	5656280	I have not. I've not watched that one yet, but I wanted to.
5657000	5659280	I just watched the first one. It's very interesting.
5660280	5663720	I got what is it for those our audience at home?
5664520	5667200	It's best that you don't know what the premise is.
5667200	5671080	It's it's I'll try to it's a it's a con man
5671600	5675800	who is kind of like a catch me if you can kind of a person
5676120	5680400	that just kind of goes down a row, a row of just
5680760	5684480	conning, conning, conning, conning, conning and gets like a moment
5684480	5688440	in the sun in the 70s during like the gas crisis.
5690440	5694040	And it's like delivering like this is a new car
5694040	5699840	that's going to save the world. Oh, and then.
5700080	5702800	And then you find out a lot.
5702800	5706920	Oh, it's so it's like someone trying to sell an electric vehicle.
5706920	5708960	And it seems like it's some sort of Elizabeth Holmes thing
5708960	5710560	where they don't really have it.
5710560	5712000	I don't know if it's an electric.
5712000	5714440	It's definitely like that, Elizabeth Holmes thing.
5714440	5716120	But I don't think it's an electric car.
5716120	5719680	I think it's just it has it's a car with three wheels.
5719680	5721920	So they thought it would use less gas.
5723760	5725520	That makes sense. One less wheel.
5725520	5727160	Yeah. Yeah.
5727160	5728880	That's what the gas goes.
5728880	5730440	Yeah. It goes into the bill.
5730440	5732120	It keeps the wheels inflated.
5732120	5735840	So I forgot about the Elizabeth Holmes thing is amazing that she was like,
5736160	5738960	it's a box that tells you if you have anything.
5740800	5742080	Just make the box.
5742080	5745680	And then it was like people are like, the inside of the box is tricky
5745680	5747600	because there's a we got it.
5747600	5750960	This it takes your blood and then it takes it inside the box
5750960	5754800	and then showing these animations of the keyboard.
5756200	5757440	The keyboard elves take it.
5757440	5760960	They take it to the three ones that have a drop of blood here.
5761960	5763840	This is this bloody box.
5763840	5766720	And it's just close.
5766720	5769560	And I don't like that.
5769560	5775040	Netflix has created a new genre called.
5775120	5780160	This should have been a 90 minute movie documentary or not.
5780160	5785960	And in any case, is now a 10 episode series.
5786480	5788480	I am offended.
5788480	5790880	I am made to feel old.
5791040	5796280	I don't like frankly, I'm going to get canceled for saying it.
5799200	5801280	Here's the thing about one division.
5801280	5802600	I know it's not Netflix.
5802600	5806640	I'm saying I'm talking about streaming now, what Netflix has created.
5809280	5814680	You wouldn't be able to have a pilot like that in the days when that's correct.
5815000	5817960	I like like and I get it like
5819400	5822640	I understand it's because like, oh, appointment viewing and all that stuff.
5822640	5824280	But there was a craft to it.
5824280	5825440	It makes me feel so old.
5825440	5830680	I'm like, you can't you can't just say that on episode three,
5830680	5833320	things are going to start making sense.
5834200	5835600	That's not allowed.
5835600	5839120	They're leading a Marvel name like the Marvel name is like, trust us.
5839120	5840800	Yeah, I don't like that either.
5840800	5842120	I don't you don't have to.
5842120	5843320	Well, I don't like that.
5843320	5849200	I don't like watching a TV show whose parent company is also like like
5850440	5854080	they're like, oh, here, be confused.
5854200	5856960	Something that would get Dan Harmon fired in 2006,
5857760	5861120	which is just like using a genre to tell a story.
5861120	5864040	But like, you know, fuck you if you want details.
5864040	5865280	Go eat a dick.
5865280	5866920	We'll see you in episode two.
5866920	5868320	Here's five minutes of credits.
5868320	5869640	Episode two starts.
5869640	5870480	Hey, here's a little more.
5870480	5871680	Fuck you sideways.
5871680	5873040	Fuck you at an angle.
5873040	5875200	Oh, here you go with the episode three.
5875440	5876400	What did you do?
5876400	5877960	Like, we'll give you a 45 seconds.
5877960	5879400	Oh, maybe the Hulk farted.
5879400	5880680	I don't know. Here's Kat Dennings.
5880680	5882120	She'll explain it all now.
5882120	5884600	Meeting with the goddess like this is a pilot.
5885200	5887600	It's a pilot called One Division.
5887760	5889440	It's a good pilot.
5889440	5891240	But here's the problem.
5891240	5895240	You'd have that shit in a half an hour.
5895280	5898280	And your second episode, fucking One Division
5898280	5900040	have to be fighting corrupt lumberjacks
5900040	5902480	and it'd have to be fucking good.
5902480	5905040	You see that they see the night stalker,
5905840	5908800	the NBC or not NBC, the Netflix thing.
5909160	5911440	You see that one. Yeah, yeah.
5911440	5913360	Kind of kind of a bummer.
5913360	5915520	I mean, the whole thing was kind of like, OK,
5915520	5917680	we're going to buy guns.
5919600	5921720	Like all of them now, right?
5921720	5922680	Oh, because you're scared.
5922680	5925440	Well, for me, the weird thing was that the two cops
5925440	5928520	that they follow don't do anything.
5928720	5930720	They never catch the night stalker.
5930720	5932440	They have the shoe.
5932440	5934520	They got the shoe print, Kumail.
5934520	5938200	Yeah. All they do is over and over get the same fucking shoe print.
5938200	5940960	And the document presents them as like the heroes.
5940960	5943800	Like you said, you guys, they did nothing.
5943920	5946520	There was another guy who got like in another town
5946520	5948280	who got the bracelet, beat up a guy.
5948280	5950200	The guy was like, this is who the night stalker is.
5950200	5951280	Yeah, yeah.
5951280	5954280	It was not like the fact that they were just like, oh, my God.
5954280	5957000	Look at that guy's like, I'm going to beat the hell out of you.
5957360	5960400	Yeah. Some other person just beat up somebody in the toilet
5960400	5963600	with the night stalker was there was no like detective work going on.
5963800	5967680	Yeah, he killed like 40 people in the same shoe.
5967920	5970760	And this guy just like collected the shoe prints over and over.
5970760	5974080	He killed 40 people in the same shoe.
5975920	5978640	A rare shoe, a rare shoe.
5978640	5981520	Yeah, like there's two, one terrible crime.
5981960	5988080	They're like serialization, serialization in television is like gravity.
5988440	5991440	It exists. It will exist no matter what you do.
5991480	5995440	Your job as a TV craftsperson is to fight it.
5997520	6000800	I feel the same way about serialization and killers.
6001120	6004400	If you want your television story to stay aloft,
6004800	6008520	it is by fighting serialization, modularity.
6008760	6011600	Episodicness.
6012040	6013680	That's why it's not a movie.
6013680	6016280	Isn't it also true that now
6016280	6021280	when you're making a show for like NBC, it's got a it's it's everybody's got that.
6021440	6025840	But if you bought the streaming service, you're already in the pocket
6025920	6027280	for whatever they're putting on.
6027280	6030680	So that's what I don't like is that these kids now are going like,
6030960	6034000	here's my pitch for a show in episode one.
6034240	6035480	There's a zombie.
6035480	6038280	And then you and then it's like, whoa, what's with the zombie?
6038280	6039920	But also he has a wedding ring.
6039920	6044440	And then he takes a shit in the toilets like, whoa, give me the wedding ring.
6044560	6047320	And you're like, what's going on?
6047320	6049960	I'll skip over episode two and tell you by the show.
6049960	6052400	But here's what happens in episode three. Here's my point.
6053360	6056520	The toilet makes rings that fight zombies.
6056720	6058720	Oh, that's a pilot.
6058920	6063080	I that's my point is that you can't like that's now how shows are being pitched.
6063080	6065400	Like, like the market has been inflated.
6065400	6068440	People are like now pitching streaming services.
6068440	6070880	They're going, I have a pitch for a show for you.
6070880	6074800	And they pitch a 10 episode story where they include.
6074800	6078360	And I'm not just farting out of my butthole here.
6078680	6081520	I'm that's what that's what stream services want, though.
6081520	6085320	I think I've been developing this show because they keep buying shit.
6085800	6088000	Yeah. But no, but they they actually went.
6088000	6090960	Well, can you add some some serialized?
6091240	6094880	Like they want it like they wanted to see more more stuff.
6094880	6097080	And they're like slow down.
6097080	6099560	Whoa. What do you mean, Mark and Mindy?
6100440	6101840	Slow down.
6101840	6104040	Episode one is Mark and then episode four.
6104560	6106600	No, no, no. Whoa.
6106600	6109840	Season one is Mindy.
6110840	6115560	Like and there's an egg in the yard and it's like what's with that egg?
6115760	6121520	Like that's the problem is that I like like like it's it's like
6121520	6124880	there used to be this like for bad reasons.
6124880	6128960	There was good things happening, which was like we got to keep this audience.
6128960	6132320	We have to assume the customer is always right.
6132520	6135960	The customer in TV is an asshole who has no
6136360	6140760	shits to give tuning in at any moment
6140760	6144080	in your half hour of derivative garbage.
6144320	6146400	And they could leave at any second.
6146400	6147800	You got to hook them.
6147800	6149880	You got to hook them with fucking craft.
6150200	6151600	Mamma jamma.
6151600	6155520	And I think there's something I can't shake like the goodness of that.
6155520	6159120	When I watch these shows where I'm like, when I watch Wandavision,
6159120	6163560	I go like this production design is amazing.
6163560	6165280	There is genius happening here.
6165280	6168160	I've seen a lot of people homage
6169760	6172160	the fifties era of television.
6173200	6177520	This makeup and these sets and the cinematography, this is like.
6178400	6179600	Great.
6179600	6182320	And but I'm like, God damn it.
6182320	6184800	Oh, wait, did you cringe, Rob?
6184800	6187200	You disagree. You're like.
6187200	6188600	Oh, no.
6188600	6191120	Oh, you're cringing because you're like, I can't believe he's going
6191120	6193000	after Wandavision. Why?
6193000	6198400	No, I haven't seen I don't I I was just I'm just saying, man.
6198400	6200000	I'm bored a little. I'm sorry.
6200000	6202400	I'm just a little bit bored.
6202400	6206160	Yeah, I mean, I haven't seen the show.
6206760	6212680	I mean, I wasn't going to watch it, but it's around the topic of like Disney plus
6212680	6217160	like anybody doing the deep dive on the cat from outer space
6217160	6222280	or the Shaggy DA or any of that shit like Kate didn't know any of that stuff.
6222280	6225160	I said, oh, we got to watch the cat from outer space.
6225360	6229760	And I put it on in like two seconds and she's like going, fuck this movie.
6231920	6235480	What about like the computer war tennis shoes
6235480	6237680	and all those things? Yeah, they have that.
6237680	6244880	They have like Escape to which that is a weird time of of Disney
6244880	6248120	where they were just like trying to figure it out.
6248120	6251120	It's like like premises.
6251120	6252800	It was a lot of premises.
6252800	6254480	Yeah, it's really strange.
6254480	6257000	You see, like the cat from space.
6257240	6259360	Yeah, it's cat from outer space.
6259360	6263680	He's got a magic necklace that makes him move shit around
6263680	6268880	and his lips don't move when he talks and a million dollars something
6268880	6271400	or the goose with the golden or something like that.
6271400	6273240	There was one like that.
6273240	6274960	Yeah, although.
6274960	6277320	Yeah, the Russell in like 15 of them.
6277440	6280400	Oh, yeah, they had actors in the stable.
6280400	6283360	It's like Kurt Russell was like friends, Jody Foster to
6284640	6285200	who else?
6285200	6287520	There was another guy that was in like all those Disney movies
6287520	6291160	and like he and Kurt Russell were buddies because Frank Johnson.
6292040	6293920	They're another famous guy.
6293920	6296960	And it was like because they were just Disney property
6296960	6298880	and they would just be in these movies.
6298880	6303200	I can't remember who the other when Carpenter was a million dollar duck.
6304280	6306400	Yeah, that's what the million dollar duck.
6306400	6308120	That's exactly the one I was trying to think of.
6308120	6311680	Yeah, yeah, it's just like the love bug and combined them.
6312080	6314960	Yeah, car that talks to you, the cat from space.
6314960	6317240	Here you go. Guy got really smart.
6317240	6319880	Here you go. Make a movie.
6320520	6322040	Yeah, I'll make a new one.
6322040	6324360	Come out, make a new one. What's the new one right now? Go do it.
6324720	6328440	Oh, my God. A dog. He is a serial killer.
6330520	6332960	That's like he's a serial killer.
6332960	6338160	It's not. I mean, that's it's not Kujo because it's like the dog is
6338400	6341320	the dog has an M.O. The dog has a signature.
6341600	6343960	Like the dog is doing it for a reason.
6343960	6349160	That's the day. It would be interesting to like we found urine all over this body.
6349160	6352680	It's the third time with all over this guy.
6353200	6356760	I think it's called The Best Friend of Sam.
6358120	6362840	That's what if you did like one in that style
6362840	6367200	with that music and like the same like voice casting and stuff like that.
6367200	6371000	And the dog is walking around. It's like, wow, what about her?
6373520	6376600	What about that? That's my type. Yeah.
6377160	6381320	Do you guys understand the length of the walk?
6381320	6384200	Because I feel like sometimes Cody and I are like,
6385360	6386640	I got too much going on.
6386640	6390960	Yeah, me too. And like we'll take them on our what we call the short walk,
6390960	6392680	which is we take them down.
6392680	6395200	You're tricking them into thinking that they've done the full walk.
6395200	6398960	But I truly don't think that their behavior to me seems like they
6398960	6402960	if they don't get the walk, they start going out of their goddamn minds.
6403240	6405400	But then it doesn't matter.
6405400	6410400	I think it's a human thing that it'd be like that walk was hardly anything
6410600	6414240	like the ritual of harnessing them up and taking them out.
6414240	6416320	And like, like I would take them down to a cul-de-sac
6416320	6418160	and we bring them back up cul-de-sac.
6418160	6419960	What am I fucking?
6419960	6422240	Oh, yes. I'm going to let it go.
6423840	6428920	The the the but or we'll take them around the block, 85000 blocks.
6428960	6430760	Like they act the same when we bring them back.
6430760	6432920	They're never like their television.
6432920	6434600	That's their TV.
6434600	6435560	Yeah, but they don't.
6435560	6439720	They if they get if they get two minutes of Knight Rider as opposed to 22 minutes
6439720	6442920	to they act as if they've seen a whole episode of Knight Rider.
6442920	6446000	That's why they're like this walk didn't have the full story.
6446000	6447520	I don't want to go on a third walk.
6447520	6449440	It feels like they just like sniff shit.
6449440	6453080	And I'm like, like, like sometimes I'll let them sniff shit until they're done.
6453760	6454680	I always do.
6454680	6457760	Cody's like, she'll she's not above like, come on.
6458240	6460200	And I'm like, whoa.
6460200	6461520	But like they'll sniff shit.
6461520	6464160	Then like you take them around, they're just sniffing shit.
6464320	6465920	They're barking at other dogs.
6465920	6468400	Then they get back home and they're like, thank you.
6468560	6472560	Like before that, they're like, you would think that you were
6473040	6475040	killing them by not taking them for a walk.
6475040	6478600	They're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, for a walk.
6478600	6480120	It would come in for a walk yet.
6480120	6483640	And then like you, but you could take them for like a two second walk.
6483680	6486040	And then they're like, they're like combined.
6486160	6489200	It's a by the way, I'm exhausted.
6489200	6490240	Like they don't.
6490240	6493240	It's like they have like a circadian rhythm or whatever you call it.
6493240	6496760	They they understand days, but they don't understand hours.
6497040	6500040	I think it's similar to Dan.
6500040	6501080	Go ahead, Emily.
6501080	6506040	I think it's similar to like ladies like me, for instance, going out sometimes
6506040	6509440	where like getting ready to go out is like the most fun part of the night.
6509440	6511040	And then you get there and you're like, this sucks.
6511040	6511920	Why am I here?
6511920	6513560	And then you're like, I can just leave now.
6513560	6517160	So the putting on of the harness that like that like anticipation.
6517400	6519320	That's the money shot.
6519320	6521200	The rest of it is like kind of useless.
6522200	6522960	That makes sense.
6522960	6526720	That I mean, that that that makes me able to relate to it, too.
6526760	6530880	I think I felt that way, too, about going out where I'm like, I don't need to be out
6530880	6534520	for six hours just because I haven't been out for six months.
6535080	6537480	I do need to have gone out.
6537480	6538920	It's like a punctuation.
6538920	6540320	I need to have gone out.
6540320	6541480	That's that's what it is.
6541480	6546560	I know Emily always says she's like the best part is having said that you went to the party.
6546600	6549560	Yeah, it's like it's like the typewriter going.
6550400	6551840	Like at the end of it.
6551840	6553440	Otherwise, you're just like typing forever.
6553440	6554840	And it would the dog.
6554840	6561360	The dog is perceiving that the typewriter cylinder is going out the door there.
6561360	6564640	I made it understandable with my metaphor.
6567680	6571480	With my keen understanding of old timey typewriters and dogs.
6571480	6575880	I have I have as a situation, everyone gets it now.
6576880	6580640	Dan, have you still been playing Death Stranding or have you stopped?
6580640	6581920	Have you given up?
6581920	6582400	I stopped.
6582400	6585120	Death Stranding drove me back into woodwork.
6587720	6593120	Or was it the problem that it was just that the game is walking and trying to balance?
6593120	6596120	And it's like that's the game.
6596880	6599680	I'm not sure there's a here's an alternate theory.
6599680	6604960	I was I had peaked with satisfactory and like
6605680	6610000	whatever game I played next was going to be like just whatever.
6610680	6612400	What's satisfactory?
6612400	6615040	It's like Minecraft, but you just make machines and factories.
6615040	6616040	It's really good.
6618160	6619360	It's the best.
6619360	6620640	It's really good.
6620640	6622240	Satisfactory.
6622240	6626440	You make like a mining machine that pulls iron out of the ground and you process.
6626440	6628600	I went to the status factory.
6628600	6631720	That's the name I you know, yeah.
6632560	6635760	But it's it's so great.
6635760	6638040	Yeah, it's just like that's.
6639080	6641240	Yeah, we're like making man.
6641240	6643480	And the new hit, man, it's really.
6643480	6644360	And we're doing Lego.
6644360	6646000	We're putting Lego stuff together.
6646000	6647680	Yeah, we made it back to one.
6647680	6650360	And now we're making a bat wing from the 1980s.
6650360	6653080	Great Batman.
6653080	6655360	Yeah, I've been streaming.
6655360	6659480	I stream on Twitch, you guys, and I'm plugging that Twitch TV slash the sixler.
6659720	6661440	But I've been playing Minecraft again.
6661440	6664640	I don't know if you've played vanilla Minecraft in forever, Dan, but like they
6664640	6668520	made another update where like the nethers got all this crazy shit in it now
6668720	6670760	and they just made a cliffs and caves update.
6670760	6675240	So there's these massive underground cave complexes that are submerged.
6675520	6678680	It's like it's crazy how different it is from like, really?
6678680	6682360	You know, yeah, I mean, there's not anything like like what they just add to
6682360	6686400	vanilla Minecraft, just add like a little bit of hopper functionality
6686400	6688520	where you could like sort things.
6688520	6689600	They still don't have that.
6689600	6691960	They have a lot more, but yeah, it's it's a bump.
6691960	6694040	You really just want some items to get it soon.
6696400	6697920	Well, that's no you should plug away.
6697920	6700040	People should be watching you on Twitch.
6700040	6703080	I also I've also wrote a D&D module.
6703280	6707520	As everyone knows, I have a dungeon master, but I wrote another D&D module.
6708120	6710000	It's called The Jungle of Wayward Wilds.
6710000	6713320	It's at Twitter or it's at the sixler dot itch dot IO.
6713600	6717560	And it's like it's kind of based on the Lost Woods from Zelda.
6717560	6719320	If anyone likes Zelda, it's like
6719320	6720600	it's I think it's really cool.
6720600	6721600	I've run it a bunch of times.
6721600	6722520	It's a lot of fun.
6722520	6723440	But you could get that.
6723440	6728120	So I, you know, the plugging wasn't my idea for coming on this show.
6728120	6729720	But, you know, come on, come on, you guys.
6729720	6731000	Yeah, come on.
6731000	6734000	Yeah, I think people should get something out of this for guys.

6775760	6777000	Well, we bought three of them.
6777000	6778480	They're fantastic.
6778480	6780960	Pretty good. Get that right, Glenn.
6781600	6784160	I got to tell you, that's a good quality shirt.
6784160	6786240	The actual material.
6786240	6788720	Oh, really? It's not it's not that hard.
6788720	6790560	Yeah, it's not like that weird thing.
6790560	6792360	It's like a good quality shirt.
6792360	6794360	Yeah, yeah.
6794360	6797400	Yeah, we've got Camille and Emily, you got anything to plug?
6798640	6801640	I'm like washing your hands, wearing wearing a mask.
6802920	6804040	Wow. Yeah.
6804040	6807120	Well, I've got dot com dot com dot com dot com.
6807120	6809920	What do you do from you ruining your hands?
6809920	6812560	Like my my skin's falling off.
6812600	6814520	Like I'm washing it so much.
6814520	6816600	You got it. You got a moisturized deck.
6816600	6818280	Yes, I do.
6818280	6819640	But the soap.
6819640	6823560	But then I didn't then I'm just washing my hands again.
6825760	6828560	Well, what do you plug?
6829040	6831720	I mean, that was it, basically.
6831720	6833120	I'll plug in Angie Max.
6833120	6835400	That's the vaccine I got.
6835400	6837880	It works really, really well.
6837880	6839800	It's a good vaccine.
6839800	6841920	I would say it's a really good vaccine.
6841920	6843280	I think it's undersold.
6843280	6844560	Check it out, New York Times.
6844560	6846200	Give us a good review.
6846200	6848280	Yes, it's contested and mother approved.
6848440	6849480	That's right.
6849480	6851400	I wrote a jingle for it.
6851400	6853680	But it's made for a woman.
6853680	6855840	Oh, Dan wrote a jingle.
6855840	6857840	Oh,
6860680	6862760	now, yeah, I mean, Max.
6865680	6867640	Gives you heart attacks.
6868520	6874200	If you take too much, if you take too much, which you shouldn't.
6875600	6879320	This tempo and it's not conducive to freestyling.
6879320	6881480	I don't know what that was just random cords playing.
6881480	6885520	So I but the jingle like the vaccine.
6886080	6889200	Is 70 percent effective.
6889200	6891680	It's where it's we're working on it.
6891680	6894120	And it's we're excited about it.
6894120	6895760	Definitely don't take too much.
6895760	6899240	Yeah, yes. And only only all people get it.
6900640	6905320	Yeah, it's right now we're only doing sixty five plus for the rest of the year.
6905320	6908880	Anyone named Amber, if your name is Amber, you can get a vaccine.
6909720	6911800	Amber's and plus sixty five.
6911800	6912960	That's it. Yeah, yeah.
6912960	6915560	We're going alphabetically.
6915880	6919240	And numerically at the same time.
6919240	6920480	But they're crisscrossing.
6920480	6923760	So oldest people and Ambers first.
6924000	6928600	And then it's going to end up with youngest newborn people with names.
6928640	6930800	Last name begins with X.
6930800	6933000	Are going to be dead.
6934560	6936440	They're going to be as good as that.
6937440	6938920	Sorry about that. Y and Z.
6938920	6942680	You get left out. So you're not in the Yolanda's or is it?
6943160	6945600	Yeah, Sabrina's.
6945600	6947760	I don't know what his name is or maybe.
6948040	6950640	Hey, do you guys know that Spencer and I have a podcast that's going to come out
6950640	6953680	very soon, maybe even in a day or two is called That Happens.
6954400	6956440	We got a That Happens happening.
6956800	6960600	And if you go to That Happens Pod, right, Spencer?
6961360	6962720	Oh, yeah, that happens.
6962720	6964080	Pod on all the things.
6964080	6967680	Instagram, Twitter, even a dot com and coming soon.
6967800	6969000	Read it in discord.
6969000	6970760	Maybe I don't know. I don't know.
6970760	6972600	We got a jingle for that, too.
6972600	6973960	Here's the jingle for that.
6973960	6975120	I want that. Damn.
6975120	6976160	Lay it on me.
6980320	6982160	This is the prelude.
6983280	6985800	That happens.
6986240	6988400	And by that, I mean fun.
6988400	6991160	That happens.
6991160	6996040	Entertainment on the run since pandemics.
6996040	6998160	Everyone has nothing to do.
6998160	7000320	So what happens?
7001560	7004000	Come join me in you.
7004000	7005360	My name is Spencer.
7005360	7009040	I'm here to say I like to roll some dice today.
7009240	7011600	I might as well do it with Jeff.
7012680	7017320	Hit, hit, hit, hit the problem I have.
7017800	7021000	The problem I have with that jingle is the stretching of the idea of laughing
7021000	7023560	into something that rhymes with Jeff.
7023560	7025080	I I thought that was cheap.
7025080	7028560	Yeah, the problem with Jeff is that you get there's death.
7028680	7031160	There's a chef and there's treble clef.
7031160	7035120	Well, maybe you should write a jingle while you do a podcast with Spencer.
7035920	7038800	OK, what's your podcast about? Yeah.
7039320	7043000	Oh, I guess you're going to have to go find out Camille.
7043000	7045000	Not you're going to have to come check it out.
7045000	7047560	It's just about nothing. It's not about it's deeper.
7047560	7051880	OK, well, Spencer and I have already done two episodes.
7051880	7053720	We haven't dropped them yet. We're about to.
7053720	7056760	And we have generated a new D&D character for me.
7056760	7060040	Or is it a spoiler if I announce what my character is?
7060560	7063360	Oh, go ahead, Jeff.
7063360	7065520	No, I'm going to save it. It's going to be good.
7065720	7067720	I basically a cat swashbuckler.
7067720	7070000	I'm I'm a tabaxi swashbuckler.
7070000	7073800	So basically, I'm I'm pushing boots, but I'm going to be fucking awesome.
7073800	7078240	It's like if bone weevil was a cat and I knew how to work on a boat.
7079200	7080520	So, yeah, there you are.
7080520	7082200	It's going to be good stuff. Really?
7082200	7084560	That happened. We got it.
7084560	7085760	It sounds like a front.
7085760	7087520	Like, I think it's like money laundering.
7087520	7089440	Like, it's not a real thing.
7089440	7095480	It's like when you go into an Armenian like
7096080	7100040	alterations place and they're like, oh, we do alterations.
7100040	7102760	And you're like, you don't.
7102760	7105360	Yeah, there's a restaurant by us that we're like,
7106160	7110600	the food is not good enough for the massive space you have here.
7110800	7116400	I think the cash only fifty seven dollars for a salad.
7116560	7117960	Is it? Whoa, whoa.
7117960	7119400	Really? You're staying here, huh?
7119400	7123640	OK, one time we went and there were four tables and we were like, can we say
7123640	7125600	that like the food's going to take two hours?
7125600	7126800	We were like, what?
7126800	7128240	They're like, I mean, we're really busy.
7128240	7131400	So it's going to be a long time before we you can order it now.
7131960	7133280	It's a front.
7133280	7135000	Well, we will call that bluff.
7135000	7136040	We're going to sit here.
7136040	7138040	We're waiting for our food. All right.
7138040	7140160	Well, we were like, we just want omelets.
7140160	7142480	It takes no time at all.
7142480	7144560	We just want omelets.
7144560	7148040	I called up a TV repairman that is in my neighborhood.
7148320	7150200	That's right near a place where I hang out.
7150200	7154840	And I never saw anybody ever go in or out of the TV repair shop.
7154840	7158440	But I my TV was on the fritz years ago and I called them up.
7158440	7162880	I'm like, hey, I got this TV and I think the light bulb has gone out.
7162880	7164960	That's how old it was. The TV had a light bulb, everybody.
7165840	7169160	And the guy's like, yeah, OK, let me call you back.
7169480	7172120	And he called me back and said, yeah, it's going to be like three thousand dollars.
7172120	7174240	I called somebody else like, yeah, it's like one hundred dollars.
7174440	7175760	So that's a front.
7175760	7177760	They're saying you could come in here.
7178240	7181120	We can we will find you a light bulb for your TV.
7181120	7185600	But it's going to cost you a lot of money to to take time out of our busy
7186200	7189840	money laundering and heroin dealing, you know,
7190440	7193000	it's across from the drawing room.
7193000	7194560	That's what I was going to say to Emily.
7194560	7196960	But yes, it is. That's right.
7196960	7201760	I because they they kept expanding and they kept making it look more like a home.
7202000	7205360	But if you walked in there, which you can't because the door is never open,
7205360	7208400	but you look at the yes, they do have three or four TVs.
7208640	7212600	And it looks like maybe somebody in there is slightly interested
7212600	7214840	in the TV repair trade.
7215440	7219440	However, call them on the phone and ask them for a quote.
7220080	7223400	And I think they really want you to go fuck off and then ask where they're
7223600	7226440	you know, they want to go look for their heroin, heroin shipment or something.
7226440	7229200	I feel like that whole strip mall across from the drawing room,
7229440	7234120	including yield rustic, like that entire strip mall is just like
7234680	7238240	like Ben Affleck's character in the accountant, like is just like
7238240	7239760	keeping the whole thing going.
7239760	7243920	It's like, oh, there's like an Apple repair store that never has any
7244200	7247960	any cables. And then there's like a realty place that
7248880	7250880	and then there's a you know, it's like an art.
7250880	7254400	Also, there's like an art studio that sells clothes on occasion.
7254400	7256160	I don't it doesn't make any sense.
7256160	7258000	Well, now those are all gone.
7258000	7260480	All that remains is these the strange
7261880	7264920	like real estate like Sotheby's or whatever the hell.
7264920	7266720	Yes, I guess right.
7266720	7269760	You've never seen anybody go in or out of that building.
7269760	7271480	That is certainly a brothel.
7271480	7275680	I guarantee you it is a it is a it is a QAnon.
7275680	7279760	So people walk in and they go like I'm looking for a flat two level ranch.
7280960	7286800	With maybe a maybe the backyard is a little very good.
7287040	7289400	Right this way. Very good.
7289400	7292480	Brothel B's is brothel B's anything brothel B's.
7292480	7294560	There we go.
7294560	7296480	I think I think we have an episode title.
7296480	7298720	I think we finally got our episode title.
7298720	7302480	Brothel B's, brothel B's,
7303760	7305920	brothel B's.
7305920	7308080	Well, my name is OK.
7308080	7310160	OK. All right.
7310640	7313320	I think on Emily's slam dunk, I think we can call it a night.
7313320	7315600	Thank you so much, Emily and Kumail for joining us.
7316000	7317480	Thank you for having us.
7317480	7320320	That was so so lovely to see your faces.
7320320	7324720	And hopefully we'll all hang hang out in person very soon.
7324720	7327160	And take the take the vaccines, people.
7327520	7329200	Yeah. Yes.
7329200	7331600	Get get that.
7331600	7332400	What's it called?
7332400	7333880	Nanjiani Max?
7333880	7337160	That's the Nanjiani Max.
7337160	7340120	Yeah, it is not covered by.
7340200	7342040	It's not been approved by the FDA.
7342040	7344320	It is not covered by insurance.
7344320	7346720	OK. Expensive. Yeah.
7346720	7351080	But it's great. I think the Nanjiani Max slogan and creed is
7352000	7355560	the FDA approval is for assholes because
7357000	7360840	on the bottle of Nanjiani Max, on the vial that you get, it says,
7360880	7363200	let's roll the dice.
7363200	7368200	Yeah, I actually feel a lot like garlic flavored because you can get garlic.
7368400	7370560	If you peel back the label, it says garlic.
7373240	7374080	Don't take too much.
7374080	7374520	All right.
7374520	7377640	Well, let's say goodbye to Kumail and Emily.
7377640	7378240	Thank you so much.
7378240	7379360	Thank you. I love you.
