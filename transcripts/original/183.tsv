0	7000	Yeah, this is entertainment, everybody!
7000	14000	From Hollywood, California, Meltdown, and comics, Harman Town is now in session!
19000	22000	Let's welcome Spencer Cittenden to the stage, shall we?
31000	36000	And the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harmon!
50000	53000	There's kind of a shower effect when you...
53000	56000	I felt like a good singer, and then the music went off, and I'm like,
56000	58000	oh, nope, bad singer.
58000	60000	Like when you're in your car, and you're like, I'm a Beegee!
60000	64000	Wait, wait, wait, let's go back and leave this class.
74000	76000	Harman, nice! Harman, nice!
82000	84000	Spencer, three points! Two for harmony!
87000	89000	Put it up, put it up!
95000	99000	The show already dedicated to Glenn Frye.
101000	105000	We prededicate that one to Eagles singer and guitar player Glenn Frye.
105000	106000	Glenn Frye died.
106000	110000	Why do I always... I guess it's stage fright, why I always need the...
110000	113000	Is the microphone too far forward?
113000	115000	I thought you guys liked it back a little bit.
117000	119000	Is director Chris Peruff back there?
119000	121000	Good for camera.
121000	123000	It's good for camera if it's back a little bit.
123000	125000	Yeah, we don't care about you guys.
125000	128000	We just want to milk your laughs, your presence.
128000	131000	This feels better because this feels like the way it's always been.
131000	136000	Yeah, colloquially backstage with the crew, we call you the aphids.
138000	143000	It's a reference to those ants that milk aphids.
143000	145000	I thought we called them the day sleepers.
146000	148000	Wait, they're the vampires?
149000	151000	No, no, they're just lazy.
154000	158000	We talked in Miami, I think, before the guy got punched in the face.
158000	160000	We were talking a little bit about...
160000	164000	It's not because of the transgender...
164000	166000	I still don't know if you call it a movement.
166000	168000	I think that sounds a little weird.
168000	170000	It sounds like whatever.
170000	174000	The transgender thing that's happening, the newfound awareness of it.
174000	179000	It has raised this very interesting question.
179000	182000	It's just sort of on a fundamental level about bathroom dichotomy.
182000	184000	Like, what are we doing? What have we been doing?
184000	189000	I think a very well-intended thing in the past, in the days of long ago
189000	194000	when bathrooms were just maybe like bushes or caves.
194000	197000	Maybe there probably was a great progressive thought behind like,
197000	200000	oh, ladies go over there and the fellas go over there.
200000	204000	But it's not as complicated as just tearing down that wall because men are pigs.
204000	206000	And sometimes women, too.
206000	210000	There are differences between different things that happen in men's rooms and women's rooms.
210000	213000	The big thing that you brought up...
213000	216000	I got to say, I was wrong about that. I looked it up way off.
216000	218000	What?
218000	225000	I told you, I said on this very stage to millions of unsuspecting people
225000	229000	that single-user stalls end up screwing women over.
229000	235000	But it turns out single-user stalls are the best way to push out and equalize wait times.
235000	239000	And wait times are truly the commodity of the bathroom.
239000	241000	Okay. Well, I can't...
241000	243000	I'm sorry. Hang on, Dan. I remember...
243000	246000	I just listened to that Miami episode today.
246000	247000	You're saying...
247000	252000	Well, you said that time was that women take longer biologically and that's why...
252000	253000	Yes, which is true.
253000	254000	It is true.
254000	259000	To that end, that has only affected non-single-user genderless bathrooms.
259000	262000	That's only affected the current bathroom paradigm.
262000	264000	Well, let me cut...
264000	267000	You guys, you got to look up potty parody.
267000	272000	Let me cut to my chase because I thought I was a genius getting out of the shower today.
272000	273000	You still are.
273000	274000	I took a shower today.
274000	275000	You still are.
277000	279000	Actually, I wasn't a genius. I ripped this off.
279000	280000	Somebody on Twitter said this.
280000	283000	And they mentioned your name because they said the discussion you guys were having.
283000	293000	And they said, do have multiple bathrooms, but make them long and short in terms of the time you're going to take.
293000	296000	Are you making a number one or a number two, kind of?
296000	300000	Or are you making a number two and or female?
301000	304000	Women don't want to be lumped in with shitting men.
306000	312000	But I would say if you look at it more like lanes on a freeway, okay?
312000	321000	There's separation on the freeway that when people don't observe it, shit gets fucked up and you get mad at them because they don't know how to drive right.
321000	327000	You know, what if we had like two or even three bathrooms at the place, the bigger the place, add more lanes.
327000	331000	It's like fast lane, passing lane, you know, like I just have to fucking...
331000	332000	I'm not even going to wash my hands.
333000	334000	Wait, Dan, I...
334000	338000	I'm going to piss my pants. I just need a place to do it while I check my texts.
339000	342000	Well, we'll get back to you not washing your hands after.
342000	345000	No, no, no. I always wash my hands. I was making a joke.
345000	349000	Okay. Are you saying the lane choice is on the door out front of the bathroom?
349000	354000	Yeah, it's like slow and fast. Like, are you going to take a long time? Go in here.
354000	355000	So if you're pooping.
355000	367000	And so I know and then I was toweling off and I was like, oh, that won't work because in a crowded situation, then people that are backed up in the slow lane, they're going to start going into the fast lane.
367000	369000	No, there will be shame involved in that.
370000	380000	And the only, just as on the freeway, because you like, you'll go in and you'll, you'll, and there will be a line forming outside the fast toilet, which shouldn't be happening.
380000	382000	And you'll be a piece of shit when you come out.
382000	387000	And the song, the song that will play when you leave there, don't poop in the fast lane.
388000	390000	Show brought to you by Glenn Frey, everybody.
390000	395000	And then there'll be arguments. People like a guy will come out and everyone will start booing him and he'll go, I'm a fast shooter.
398000	399000	No, you're not.
399000	402000	What is the cutoff point for what is fast and what is slow?
403000	411000	Well, that's, I mean, there should be a big red digital clock right in the door with like a spring loaded toilet.
411000	414000	Freeways. There's a speed limit.
414000	415000	You get ejected out of it.
416000	418000	You get a fine. It's a speed limit.
418000	419000	Right.
419000	421000	What's the cutoff for freeways?
421000	422000	When do you get to go in the fast lane?
422000	426000	A cop won't answer that question because he can't technically tell you to speed.
426000	430000	But the truth is, if you're trying to get to work really fast, you're supposed to go around people.
431000	432000	It's called the fast lane.
432000	435000	If we all went 55, there wouldn't be a fucking fast lane.
436000	438000	It's called the fast lane.
438000	440000	But there's a limit to the speed in that lane.
440000	446000	And so everyone's, when everyone's driving 35 on the freeway, that's when the city, that's why they built that lane.
447000	450000	It's for the days when everyone's just feeling leisurely.
452000	454000	And driving under the speed limit.
454000	457000	And you want to go 55 and a half miles an hour.
457000	459000	And so that's what this lane is for.
459000	460000	So draw me.
460000	462000	No, it's for going 70.
462000	464000	And there could be a 55 of shitting.
464000	465000	I gotcha.
465000	466000	Yeah.
466000	469000	And then there could be a Sammy Hagar of shitting who would be like, fuck you.
469000	471000	Don't tell me what to do.
471000	474000	I like to read a book when I do it.
475000	477000	I check my tweets.
477000	479000	I get on Facebook too.
479000	480000	I can't shit.
480000	482000	In less than an hour!
483000	487000	And there's like a judge, like, with her horn around glasses and she takes him off and starts dancing.
491000	493000	She's like, I like this guy.
493000	495000	He fucking shits like a fucking molasses.
495000	501000	Can you draw me up like in a grim D&D Pathfinder map of what you would like?
501000	504000	You go to an airport and you go to an airport.
504000	507000	And you have to relieve yourself.
507000	509000	You come across how many doors and what do those doors say?
509000	510000	What do those doors say?
510000	511000	Or have you got that far?
511000	512000	Oh my God.
512000	517000	They say, they say, well, when I was getting out of the shower, it was just like long and
517000	519000	short or like, or yeah.
519000	521000	Well, not number two and number one.
521000	525000	But there's, there are other factors, but let's get to those factors by, as Spencer says,
525000	527000	the big key issue first of all is wait time, right?
527000	528000	Yeah, man.
528000	529000	That's the tyranny of bathrooms.
529000	530000	So solve that.
530000	534000	And then we can get into, maybe we start to evolve a whole fucking culture about peeing
534000	537000	and washing your hands and pooping and lighting matches.
538000	539000	Oh my God.
539000	540000	Can you imagine?
540000	544000	If all of this emphasis we put on consideration, we didn't then undercut by going in the bathroom
544000	547000	and wailing all over the walls because we think everyone else is secretly a racist animal
547000	552000	and like, and we hate them and we don't want to touch the same toilet seat as them.
552000	556000	And we're electing a fascist and we're like, oh, don't forget to keep your elbows off the
556000	557000	table.
557000	558000	We're a fucking liars.
558000	560000	Like, let's look where we shit.
560000	562000	We should make it fucking scientific.
562000	564000	You should feel like a clone when you poop.
564000	565000	Don't you feel?
565000	569000	Don't you feel like a naughty clone like, like, like who scientists are mad at them
569000	570000	and testing them.
570000	573000	And like, you should, you should fucking like, it's a sanitary business.
573000	575000	How do you think babies feel when they shit?
575000	576000	They can't do anything about it.
576000	578000	They're like, oh shit, I fucked up.
578000	581000	Like, like, like, but you know, there should be luxury.
581000	582000	There should be talcum.
582000	587000	There should be, there should be love and squeezing and motorboats.
587000	588000	I don't know.
588000	589000	I don't know.
589000	590000	Wait, razzleberries?
590000	591000	Oh, okay.
591000	593000	You can't motorboat a baby.
594000	596000	Babies ain't got no titties.
599000	601000	Dear, dear, dear Penthouse.
602000	605000	I never, I never thought I should have one of these letters.
610000	613000	I work at a large Home Depot.
613000	614000	I said at Home Depot.
614000	615000	I work at Home Depot.
617000	621000	And in walked this woman with a baby that wouldn't quit.
624000	626000	I knew I had to motorboat it.
630000	631000	All right.
631000	633000	So it's time for a new segment.
633000	641000	This is called paragraphs that I, sentences I pull from newspaper articles
641000	646000	and read out of context because it's funny.
646000	648000	I think Jay Leno does this.
654000	661000	Sometimes when you read news, you get to a sentence that makes you realize
661000	669000	you're 43 in a world being taken over by children that don't know how to put
669000	671000	a thought together.
674000	675000	Okay.
675000	680000	Just a little article about Ben Carson losing his, he's always been a conservative
680000	686000	fellow, but he was also like a hometown hero to a lot of his, his own, I don't
686000	689000	know, personal kind of like, I can't even remember where he's from and what he,
689000	692000	but he was like, you know, he did, he did good stuff.
692000	694000	He's from, he's from Nappy Town.
694000	695000	He's from Nappy Town?
695000	696000	Sleepy Town.
696000	698000	He always looks like he's going to take a little note.
700000	704000	He always looks like he just had a turkey sandwich and a glass of warm milk.
704000	713000	Well, here's a, this is like me after, if I did nine yoga classes, that's, that's, that's
713000	715000	how alert he looks.
715000	723000	This is, this is out of a Washington Post article about Ben Carson and it did, the headline
723000	730000	did involve his blackness, but I still think this is a weird sentence.
731000	736000	Carson has been a black icon since 1987 when he became the first person to successfully
736000	739000	separate twins conjoined at the backs of their heads.
742000	743000	While being black.
743000	745000	Black people loved that shit.
751000	756000	You know that stereotype of the black lady in the operating room, like, get those babies
756000	758000	disconnected.
759000	760000	Ma'am.
760000	761000	Yes.
761000	764000	We're going to have to ask you to stop yelling out during your surgery.
771000	773000	See, I, I meant to say Sleepy Town first.
773000	776000	I said Nappy Town and people thought I meant Nappy like nappy hair.
776000	777000	Oh God.
777000	780000	I'm proud to say you just put that in my head.
780000	781000	Whoa.
781000	783000	I'm very proud of myself.
783000	787000	Now half of this millennial crowd knew exactly what I'm saying right now.
787000	788000	They heard that.
788000	789000	Who knows with them.
789000	791000	If I didn't, if it didn't trip my wires, I mean, that's the thing.
791000	794000	It's, we're going to, we're, this is going to be a theme tonight because we're going
794000	797000	to have a fellow up here that we've never met before on the show.
797000	800000	You and I have met him, but we're going to, we're going to be talking about the realm
800000	803000	of the uncomfortably surfacey and how deep it goes.
803000	805000	We have Dr. Ben Carson here tonight.
808000	816000	But the, and one of the themes that I'd like to talk about is the, is the sometimes damaging
816000	817000	like thing.
817000	820000	I don't know if like, I don't know if I'm stealing this from somebody clever that actually
820000	821000	coined it.
821000	822000	I think it's a really apt.
822000	825000	I mean, I read it somewhere or heard it somewhere.
825000	828000	A penny saved is a penny earned.
828000	837000	The, the, the, the, the sort of the new, the modern kind of code of, of, of, I don't know
837000	838000	what to call it.
838000	841500	Political correctness like has all these negative connotations with the sort of like the, if
841500	846500	you could come up with like a golden rule of, of sort of social etiquette, political,
846500	848500	cultural etiquette.
848500	852500	The rule has become whoever smelt it dealt it.
852500	859500	So in other words, like, like the, the, if you keep your mouth shut, like you stand tactically
859500	865000	the highest percentage chance of not being offensive, which is I think a very dangerous
865000	870500	thing because as we can see in our culture, you kind of want the idiots talking as loudly
870500	871500	as possible.
871500	875500	Like, like it's better than them slinking around in the shadows and then popping up
875500	876500	all of a sudden.
876500	880500	And becoming, becoming the front runner for one of our two political parties.
880500	881500	Yeah.
881500	886500	I would like if that guy, well, he's a, he is a fucking like, yeah, what should we have
886500	887500	done?
887500	888500	Given him a reality show.
888500	889500	Yeah.
889500	890500	We already did.
890500	891500	We gave him 30 reality shows.
891500	892500	Yeah.
892500	893500	I don't know.
893500	894500	He was good at all of them.
894500	895500	He's definitely a fucking anomaly.
895500	899500	Like, like, like, like he himself is a like, like he should be.
899500	900500	Yeah.
900500	901500	You know what?
901500	903380	I mean, there's a lot of reasons to not like Donald Trump.
903380	906780	Here's one of my top 30.
906780	909340	He says very too much.
909340	912960	That's like a, you know, I think the Mexicans are very, very, you know, I think they're
912960	918380	very good people, but they're very, you know, corrupt and our economy is very, very good.
918380	921380	But people very like me that they very, very, very like me.
921380	928500	I say, are you like a kid trying to air out your 10,000 word book report by adding more
928500	931900	varies and really is into it.
931900	932900	They had an article.
932900	938440	It was like the 76 campaign promises that we've been able to, you know, the glean from
938440	940500	what he's said so far.
940500	943420	It's really, it's really, it's very, very terrifying.
943420	946900	It's really, really, really, really, we did a very, very big wall and I'm like, I'm going
946900	949940	to bomb ISIS and I'm going to do it by having very, very good generals.
949940	950940	Yes.
950940	951940	Yes.
951940	953820	And I'm going to, and they're going to make really good bombs the best ever.
953820	958340	Like he sounds like a six year old, these bombs, these bombs are going to be so good
959340	960340	you're going to hit your head.
960340	961340	They're going to spin.
961340	963340	I mean, they'll be blown off.
963340	964340	Your heads will be blown off.
964340	967100	But as they're flying off of your body, your heads are going to spin and how good these
967100	968100	bombs are.
968100	969100	Yeah.
969100	970100	And I want to clarify something.
970100	974340	I just, I just heard myself say something that might've been offensive to, to six year
974340	982740	olds because I, it's too late that you've been coming down on six year olds for fucking
982740	983740	too long.
983740	985700	I don't want six year olds like, like to listen to this podcast.
985700	986700	They shouldn't yet.
986860	988460	But I, but I really mean this.
988460	992980	I like most of them and he, he, he's like a shitty six year old.
992980	993980	Like that's, that's right.
993980	994980	I just wanted to clarify that.
994980	998900	He's like a six year old that like, you go to like a family like Christmas and like he's
998900	1002900	the one like little cousin that's like, you're playing some game and everybody's like, this
1002900	1003900	is so cool.
1003900	1004900	We made up this game.
1004900	1008820	And then he's always the one that's like, like, like, like if you're playing, like,
1008820	1012540	let's shoot missiles with these GI Joe things, he's like, now I'm shooting a missile that
1012540	1016380	blows up every plane in the whole room, no matter where you try to hide.
1016380	1017380	Infinity.
1017380	1018380	Yeah.
1018380	1019380	Infinity.
1019380	1020820	You can't, you can't just say that.
1020820	1023860	You just said something loser.
1023860	1025300	I think there's a conflict of interest.
1025300	1029140	Why are you even moderating this GI Joe?
1029140	1030140	There's a word for that.
1030140	1031140	And it's a word that applies.
1031140	1036220	I think for almost, almost all of them with a cup, maybe one or two exceptions is petulance
1036220	1042260	and the political discourse is petulant children level of fucking discourse.
1042820	1047180	They're all 70 and they're all like, like calling each other old and they're all talking
1047180	1053100	about 9-11 like they, like it's their friend and like, yeah, they're all pieces of shit
1053100	1059700	and they were all born rich and they can all take a fuck fly.
1059700	1062500	I don't know what I was trying to do in the middle of that sounds, I know, I know the
1062500	1063500	phrase flying fuck.
1063500	1068780	I was like, you know what, Harmon, you can beat that.
1068780	1078500	They can take a first class flight, flight fuck on fucking mint, jet blue mint.
1078500	1079500	Jet blue mint.
1079500	1083180	I tried, we, we flew fucking first class jet blue, which is nice.
1083180	1087100	You sit in these little egg pods and it seems really groovy and then I went down into the
1087100	1090740	like the recline mode, but you can't just rock your seat back.
1090740	1093260	You can't just go like, like lean back.
1093260	1098500	The whole thing has to go and your legs come out into this like, like this whole long bed
1098500	1099840	frame kind of thing.
1099840	1103300	But at one point it was very clear to me that my legs were not going to get any farther
1103300	1104940	than the wall in front.
1104940	1114500	And now I'm being like Star Wars trash compactor season, 3BO, 3BO where can he be, where can
1114500	1115500	he be?
1115500	1116500	I'm so distracted.
1116500	1117500	Jeff Fort.
1117500	1121940	I can't, this is the perfect time to bring out our guests like right at the height of
1121940	1126300	you complaining about your leg room, everybody to please, it was the worst time, it's the
1126300	1127300	worst time then.
1127300	1129740	This is the worst time to do that.
1129740	1132660	Our first, the current phrase is a little person.
1132660	1133660	He's an actor.
1133660	1134660	We met him in New York.
1134660	1135660	Colin Buckingham is here.
1135660	1136660	Let's bring him in.
1136660	1137660	Awkward.
1137660	1138660	Yeah, there you go.
1138660	1139660	Sweet.
1139660	1140660	That worked perfectly.
1140660	1141660	What's up, Colin?
1141660	1142660	How you doing?
1142660	1157460	We met at the CSO launch thing, right?
1157460	1158460	Yeah.
1158460	1159460	How you been?
1159460	1160460	Doing well.
1160460	1161460	How you doing?
1161460	1162460	Great.
1162460	1163460	Did you live out here?
1163460	1164460	No, I live in New York City.
1164460	1165460	Alright.
1165460	1167380	What do you think about Jeff's leg room complaints?
1168380	1172660	I mean, he gets crunched in the first class, a kid.
1172660	1175860	The fuck you winning this?
1175860	1181540	Fucking, you try to ambush me with Colin?
1181540	1182540	You piece of shit.
1182540	1190020	This is Dan, so ashamed of him noticing things that are different about other people.
1190020	1191020	It's just funny.
1191020	1193620	You really tried to...
1193620	1199780	In his defense, though, when I was doing the reclining thing, I almost slid down into
1199780	1200780	the...
1200780	1206780	I'm trying to think, there had to be design for this really medium-height person, like
1206780	1209100	5'8", maybe, was the perfect sweet spot.
1209100	1210100	Can I put in a thing?
1210100	1216460	I did have a lot of leg room, though.
1216460	1221820	I'm fat, and that's not easy either.
1221820	1225300	The JetBlue first class, I'll go too.
1225300	1232180	As far as how you're treated as a human being, so far, they're new to first class for terrible
1232180	1233860	reasons because the airlines are cartels.
1233860	1234860	Don't get me started.
1234860	1238700	I'm sorry, the airlines are a cartel.
1238700	1240060	That's the important thing about a cartel.
1240060	1241060	It's not plural.
1241060	1244020	Otherwise, it would be fucking amazing.
1244020	1249420	It would be capitalism.
1249420	1250860	The only thing...
1250860	1253460	It's the reclining thing for me, too, for a different reason.
1253460	1255400	The tray table.
1255400	1259700	It doesn't move forward.
1259700	1264380	For me, the tray table never comes close enough to me.
1264380	1266380	They ask you to make a choice.
1266380	1267980	I mean, where's my...
1267980	1270580	I have to reach all the way over there for my food?
1270580	1273460	Well, no wonder you're so thin.
1273460	1274460	You're making...
1274460	1275460	Yeah, exactly.
1275460	1277580	Food's always all over me.
1277580	1279900	I have to eat it.
1279900	1280900	Just to stay clean.
1280900	1281900	I'm like a cat.
1281900	1282900	I'm like...
1282900	1283900	I can't.
1283900	1289300	And then I get fat.
1289300	1293260	I don't know if you know how hard it can be to be fat.
1293260	1294260	I don't.
1294260	1295260	I'm sorry.
1295260	1302380	Colin, Dan was born six foot two and fat.
1302380	1310120	They ask you to make a choice on that airline between sleep mode and just sitting up and
1310120	1311120	hanging out.
1311120	1313940	And an electric chair upright.
1313940	1318180	What you can't do is a setting that is...
1318180	1324300	It's like, I'm sleepy, but I'm playing Minecraft.
1324300	1329420	And I'm going to nod off while I'm digging for some minerals, and I'm going to wake up
1329420	1331340	and go, whoa, whoa, whoa.
1331340	1336980	And then I'm like, oh, well-placed torches, I'm fine.
1336980	1341700	And then the guy next to me is going to be like, what's he doing?
1341700	1342700	He's like a child.
1342700	1348460	Like, yeah, why don't you watch Avatar a third time?
1348460	1349460	Just because it wins an Oscar.
1349460	1350460	How long was that flight?
1350460	1351460	Were you flying from Dubai?
1351460	1352460	That's a lot.
1352460	1353460	No, I don't mean...
1354100	1355100	No, I don't mean...
1355100	1357100	He watched it a third time on the flight.
1357100	1359060	Yeah, I'm like, I'm Amelia Earhart.
1359060	1360060	I only...
1360060	1361060	All right.
1361060	1362060	Anyways.
1362060	1363060	Welcome, Colin.
1363060	1364620	I'm sorry about the way you were brought out.
1364620	1370500	I'm sorry about the way you've been treated since.
1370500	1371500	Do you like the stool?
1371500	1372500	Is it actually...
1372500	1374900	Are you doing a bit by using it or were you...
1374900	1377820	No, it made it a lot less awkward.
1377820	1381620	I think Spencer deserves a little Boy Scout badge for that.
1381620	1382620	Oh, you guys haven't met?
1382780	1383780	How's it going?
1383780	1386260	Spencer was the only one that thought about that because that's something that was like,
1386260	1387780	oh, it's progress.
1387780	1388780	Just put it out of your mind.
1388780	1389780	Don't think about anything.
1389780	1393380	Don't think about if a person that's a guest of yours that might have a need or something.
1393380	1394380	Spencer thinks about it.
1394380	1397380	I mean, I didn't think about it at all.
1397380	1400380	We had Steve Silberman on and he's...
1400380	1405580	I mean, he might not be offended by me saying he's a bit rotund and he had a lot of trouble
1405580	1406580	getting on.
1406580	1408180	And so I was like, I don't know, man.
1408180	1409180	These are some crazy stools.
1409180	1414580	These stools are built for like one butt cheek if you're a larger person.
1414580	1417860	We needed like a little more commodious accommodation.
1417860	1419100	All right.
1419100	1423740	Let's start our little person questions with the big one.
1423740	1424740	The big one.
1424740	1428700	Who you voting for?
1428700	1432740	I want to talk about the phrase little people.
1432740	1434780	You already gave me a hint.
1435780	1442020	Well, as we talked about a little bit, it changed in like the past 30 years from midget
1442020	1444740	to dwarf to little person.
1444740	1451420	And it's like going in a direction of trying to say like, hey, people that are shorter
1451420	1453180	are still people.
1453180	1458380	But I think when you say someone is a little person, it's different than saying someone
1458380	1460380	has dwarfism or something, you know?
1460380	1461380	Right.
1461380	1462380	That a person with it, yeah.
1462380	1463380	Yeah.
1463380	1464380	Because it's like you're making that their identity.
1464980	1465980	Yeah.
1465980	1469180	You know, you're saying like that person is a dwarf like that is all encompassing of
1469180	1474740	his personality or her personality or that kind of thing and like how they define themselves
1474740	1475740	as.
1475740	1479380	I always play ball with this stuff because well, I mean, it's honestly I got I'm just
1479380	1480580	a chicken shit socially.
1480580	1485540	So I would never like I would never deliberately I say shit all the time.
1485540	1486540	It makes people upset.
1486540	1489980	And it's never like because I'm like, oh, I hope people get really upset.
1489980	1490980	I know.
1490980	1493900	It's just because like I I'm like, oh, the only chance I have of making people like me
1493900	1494900	is to like talk.
1494900	1495900	That's it.
1495900	1499900	And I know it's like it's like it's like if you were Indiana Jones and you just like
1499900	1503340	you see the poison dart shooters and you're just and it's like a mile and you're just
1503340	1504340	like fuck it.
1504340	1510700	Like I'm not going to like I'll get hit with a couple and like I'll try to find an antidote
1510700	1515300	maybe or I just like maybe maybe there's a maybe if you just keep running and it's just
1515300	1518380	like the darts are hitting everybody.
1518380	1521860	The and then I get to the front and there's the idol and I have a bag of sand and like
1521860	1522860	I'm not going to weigh it now.
1522860	1525300	I got fucking darts all over me.
1525300	1530820	The darts aren't supposed to come out and shut up.
1530820	1532220	What did you what did you design this place?
1532220	1537020	Why didn't you turn it off so I could get the idol?
1537020	1543660	The please rent Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark it's a it's a great film.
1543660	1546340	The God damn it.
1546340	1550940	So when I I don't remember where I was or what year it was when the little person thing
1550940	1556940	got floated it was like and I was like okay but it was the same as like the phrase African-American
1556940	1560780	I've always said is like it really rubs me like it's not my job to be rubbed the right
1560780	1561780	way or the wrong way.
1561780	1564580	That's the thing and then I just go like okay if that's what we're saying but I think that's
1564580	1568900	fucking weird because you're saying that you're in that case it's like the thing that I think
1568900	1572380	is weird about it is that and I know that what they're doing is they're adding syllables
1572380	1577860	and I do understand the because it's like it's about dehumanization like any phrase
1577860	1583740	that you can use to like make someone sound like not a someone yeah if you say someone
1583740	1587620	who has autism you say yeah he's an autistic like that sounds right all of a sudden it's
1587620	1591740	offensive yeah then I sound like an asshole yeah but if you say he is autistic yeah it's
1591740	1597020	like it's a little like especially yeah do you think that is there something new on the
1597020	1602740	horizon that might like that term will evolve I've been workshopping a couple that I'd like
1602740	1609940	to run by you and I can I tell them that I got they all clear no terrible desk piece
1609940	1620620	that would be what is I don't I don't I mean for me like I think in my ideal world it would
1620620	1626620	be if someone was describing how I looked and like to someone who would be he has dwarfism
1626620	1633180	or right he has achondroplasia but achondroplasia is a five-syllable word and we don't like
1633180	1639900	saying more than three usually so right that's that's not very likely yeah I mean you definitely
1639900	1643100	need but when someone says like little present is that does that something that kind of like
1643100	1648380	no it doesn't offend me at all it's just I don't it's just not how I it's like it doesn't enter my
1648380	1652380	conscience it's like that painting of a ship in your bathroom that your every time you pee you're
1652380	1659900	like what one of these days yeah it's not ruining the house but why I'm not even into ships who
1659900	1666260	bought this yeah I mean it's just like like I was saying before it's not like a it's not that much
1666260	1670700	of a prevalent part of my identity where you know it's it's like not something I go out into the
1670700	1677580	world thinking until it's the terms used and I'm like oh right yeah and but I mean that being said
1677580	1681660	I don't mean to I mean because other people love the term little person that have dwarfism other
1681660	1685820	people are like yes because I mean it's the whole organization little people of American they do you
1685820	1690380	know amazing things they have scholarships they because like when when a baby has a disability
1690380	1694220	sometimes their parents will give out up for adoption and they like do adoption coordination
1694220	1699180	for people with dwarfism that kind of thing so by saying I'm not a fan of that it's just me saying
1699180	1704060	that like as someone who was in middle school when the term was changed from dwarf to middle
1704140	1711500	little person and I was just kind of supposed to be like okay right that's what I am now right
1712380	1717020	right out to the playground with all these Winston Churchill's these fucking these professional
1717020	1721500	diplomats in the making they're real good at handling this kind of thing well but I mean it's
1721500	1727180	just I didn't get a choice in like how it's just like that's what I am now and you go to like a
1727180	1731340	public school or private schools yeah I was in a public middle school I was actually also the only
1731340	1735340	white kid in my middle school so that was that's kind of like I used to think you fucking you
1735340	1741580	doubled down yeah and I and I was the only guy with long curly hair played the violin and loved
1741580	1747100	Pokemon and had Pokemon too so I was just like yeah yeah making fun of you was like like too
1747100	1753740	like uh fuck it yeah yeah you could they could have just picked violin yeah that would have been
1753740	1757900	enough there's like a plethora of things they could that's great you should also just put a fake
1757900	1767100	unicorn horn I just I just just fucked up like six thousand black kids like who just would go out
1767100	1778540	into the world and go I I swear though I swear I'm not racist and I'm also I'm not I don't believe
1778540	1786700	in magic but god damn it I guess that's that's not a joke you can even uh uh propose in the
1786700	1793900	post-internet era I was like like like I yeah I went I was I went to I was probably one of and
1793900	1797900	people think I'm exaggerating when I say this but I have photos of my eighth grade graduation like
1797900	1804620	where it's like comically and delightfully uh evident I was like one of like I would say
1805180	1813100	in a 2000 kid junior high I was probably I think like one of 20 white kids uh we there was a thing
1813100	1817180	in Milwaukee which is like NPR just talked about being one of the most segregated cities in the
1817180	1822300	in the country there's this effort to like like you know they try to like try to try to desegregate
1822300	1827740	in both directions try to like so they had a computer specialty program they had two apple
1827740	1834060	two e's in the basement of an inner city uh middle school so that so that I would come in and and
1834060	1839340	learn to you know program in basic like in the in the in the basement of this place and like like
1839340	1843420	you know this is like very naive but well-intended like attempt to like something's wrong and we got
1843420	1849660	to like take a proactive uh step but I what what I noticed from that experience is that I as I've
1849660	1854940	said before black people are not racist uh white people are because I then went to a high school
1854940	1859100	where it was flipped and it was like we were horrible and I was like I never got beat up for
1859100	1863980	being white I never got I got I never got like there was never any jokes there was never any
1863980	1869820	dehumanization at all it was never nobody like made me nobody like wanted to party with me like
1870860	1876380	I was a nerd but I was I was not I was not like I did not feel fucking inhibited or anything like
1876380	1881180	that this is a fucking I where was your school con what part of it is in uh southern Maryland
1881180	1886540	like near dc area was it was it like was it rough was it was it fun for you or bad or is it
1886540	1893100	it wasn't fun I mean the you know the aforementioned pokemon and violin kind of
1894300	1901180	saw to that but it was I mean like I like when you're saying you like you didn't get bullied
1901180	1905260	for being white like I never got really bullied but I did get like kids would accuse me of like
1905260	1910220	getting favoritism or something right because um you know like the teacher was white and I was white
1910220	1914620	and then there was you know like I I would do my work sometimes and then like other kids would do
1914620	1920700	the work too within like the I don't know it was but I mean that's not I realize that sounds like
1920700	1926700	the most elitist thing to say like I was accused of favoritism for no I mean that's that I do you
1926700	1931740	think it actually could have in maybe some even tiny way white privilege or no that was just I
1931740	1938540	mean if the teacher I didn't know enough about it and my memories of that time are because that
1938540	1944300	would be amazing if that that's how strong white privilege runs I mean it may well be I don't know
1944300	1948220	it does it does white people are fucking racist that's what we're good at like we're really good
1948220	1953260	at it we're naturally we have a lot of practice for racism I know it's like like like I don't know
1953260	1956940	I want I'm I make that joke all the time but it's like I don't think it's genetic but I think it's
1956940	1963020	fucking really really strong the momentum because I have been in I've observed these situations in
1963020	1967980	a pre-internet world so now there's a whole new generation but at this moment there's you know
1967980	1973580	that this shit to that toxic like still is has tendrils even though we're now all talking to each
1973580	1980620	other and sharing stories and everything's very verbose but like in my growing up I saw every
1980620	1985580	kind of configuration you could see and I remember noticing I was like that that guy is being really
1985580	1990860	mean to that guy like this person has all the power and there and I and the reverse of it like
1990860	1995900	I had in that in that school I mentioned like all of my teachers were black and I felt the
1995900	2004780	I felt the the reverse like uh thing and I was I was like good like I deserve it I was like I was
2004780	2009740	like that self-loathing already as a kid I was just like I get it man I'm surrounded by kids who
2009740	2015020	there's fucking like this shitty like they're they're 12 years old and they're writing like uh
2015580	2020780	with magic marker like they're they're being indoctrinated we all were into like gang culture
2020780	2026700	like I knew how to beat box by uh 11 years old and because and I knew how to like write the right
2026700	2030940	gang signs and stuff and it was like this if you're a teacher and you've bothered to like dedicate
2030940	2035420	your life to like molding minds and you see that happening on the way out the door of your school
2035420	2040220	you're gonna get mad and you're going you're only human too so when the white kid raises his hand
2040220	2044780	for every question you're gonna start treating him like a piece of shit and I was like like like
2044780	2049980	and being like why don't you fucking cool it nerd and like let like like hit the showers and
2049980	2054140	finally like like like see if I can work some magic here and I was like I was like yeah I get
2054140	2060140	it I get it I've seen enough movies about this shit no I just wouldn't raise my hand I just like
2061020	2065500	I just and well I mean also I didn't like putting attention on myself to begin with because I mean
2065500	2071660	when when I'd like some from about six through I'd say probably 14 when I started going to high
2071660	2076700	school um you know it was like and I didn't realize this because as a kid you're just kind
2076700	2081820	of focused on yourself but I mean everyone gets bullied and that kind of thing but for me it
2081820	2086140	seemed like disproportionate right you know because like that's no pun intended yeah
2090460	2095900	if you guys can't handle that you're gonna hate what he's about to say
2095900	2104300	the bullying was disproportionate no but you said yourself you said you said like you always
2104300	2110300	felt like uh like there was there was favoritism but but or accusations or suspicions of favoritism
2110300	2115180	and you said you didn't actually get bullied so like the like I was I was bullied like not
2115740	2119660	not for being white just like for being short right that was you know because I mean I look
2119660	2123660	different people don't like difference when there had to be jokes behind your back and
2123740	2128860	behind your back never works yeah yeah no but I mean they weren't clever no they were just like
2128860	2137500	pointing out like like literally just like your shortens like yeah or you know like I was like
2137500	2146940	your head's large yeah because my brain is bigger than yours if your brain was my size you wouldn't
2146940	2153580	be saying that bullshit now so so then that takes us to your choice to become an actor yeah stellar
2153820	2159980	yeah hit your wagon to the star that no but it's like the one career that's based on my looks yeah
2159980	2165260	yeah do you think like where how much of it is like just a passion for acting and how much of
2165260	2170860	it is like man first of all I got calluses all over that part of my brain you know like I can
2170860	2178060	take a punch like yeah or I mean part of it's me I mean I'm sure ever since the kid I've always
2178060	2181420	like whenever people have said you can't do something I've always wanted to say you know
2181420	2187420	well fuck you I'm going to like because I mean doctors still don't know a lot about
2187420	2191740	dwarfism because it's a relatively recent thing and it's um I just looked up the figure while I
2191740	2196860	was backstage and there's like maybe even less than what I'd estimate there's like 35,000 people
2196860	2201100	oh okay I love that you're the one googling and then I just bring you out and go hey how does it
2201100	2209740	feel to be small google it mother fucker wait wait con there's there's less than 35,000 people
2209740	2215660	dwarfism in the US uh yeah I think yeah you said 100,000 yeah that was a very much listen I mean
2215660	2221340	even that 100,000 seems very low like yeah I mean it's it's just not that prevalent of a thing it's
2221340	2228460	it's just because it's very nearly around 40,000 births really yeah is there is that is there any
2228460	2233420	like like looking back for history of like has it been the same throughout history has it gone up
2233420	2240220	and down or do we even know that well I mean historically I mean people were babies were
2240860	2246380	kind of killed a lot when they had differences that were yeah kind of like that so and also
2246380	2253100	record keeping wasn't yeah but actually like some in some cultures like I'm gonna be wrong so I'm
2253100	2257180	not even gonna attempt to say which one it was but there's like paintings and stuff where you see
2257180	2262140	people with dwarfism in very highly respected positions like you know because like you're
2262140	2265260	saying with the whole brain thing like they were thought to be more intelligent and that
2265260	2269100	kind of thing in some cultures but and you know Spartan stuff they would kill them yeah
2269100	2272780	people left hand that were left-handed were killed too yeah yeah it didn't take a whole lot
2272780	2280380	yeah they're just like look like are we a society or are we uh an emotion workshop or do we or do we
2280380	2287260	love freckles this guy uses this guy needs special scissors I say uh cheaper to feed the dogs
2287260	2293740	uh yeah I mean well that's that I mean that's a really fascinating thing about humanity too
2293740	2298300	is that we live in this like first world empire where we I think among the many assumptions that
2298300	2305660	we don't know we're making um is that morality like um particularly inter-human uh morality uh
2306220	2312060	it's not like genetic it's not born into you it that doesn't make it not valuable like we have
2312060	2317180	this like misconception that it's like the the really uncomfortable truth is that human beings
2317180	2327820	are designed to survive wherever you might happen to drop them like and that is so if you are living
2327820	2335660	in a society that is hateful you will not use the word hateful to to describe the thing that's
2335660	2341100	hateful you'll use the word normal to describe the word hateful um if you're a Spartan for the
2341100	2345580	example I always use because they had this like really historically documented incredibly specific
2345580	2350700	society where you got killed apparently for being left-handed it's like the kids growing up in that
2350700	2355820	world they weren't like like man this is fucked up lately like I'm sure some of them were and then
2355820	2360620	they got killed because that's worse than being left-handed they were but they weren't like like
2360620	2366540	like people didn't go to bed and like sweat and like have acid reflux and go to a therapist and
2366540	2370620	go I can't figure it out and they're like well you're a Spartan and you're supposed to be living
2370700	2377340	in Wisconsin in 2016 uh where where everything's very enlightened oh thanks doc I'll move there
2377340	2382700	right away it with the therapist was a Spartan and said you should have your head cut off uh
2382700	2391180	and my job shouldn't exist because this is Sparta um the the it we and we need to acknowledge that
2391180	2394780	not because we need to hate ourselves more we need to be proud of the fact that we're able to
2394780	2400060	adapt to anything but we need to I think we need to like like that the illusion that we have some
2400060	2407740	inborn sense of right and wrong is is is just dangerous as the other thing that that that is
2407740	2411660	it's this illusion that if you say the right combination of words you can you can make
2411660	2417420	everything better and I did that whoever smelt a delta rule um because now and then we're talking
2417420	2423980	a I'm a I'm a writer and a producer talking to an actor and so like you were just telling me in the
2423980	2430220	green room like you were like obviously any like you said you just went out for your first
2430220	2434220	part that was like that had nothing to do with your well not my first but like it's been
2435980	2441740	and part of that student to my agent being one of you know she's she's cool with sending me out for
2441740	2447980	anything that you know young 20s ish the casting director yeah well your agent my agent is um but
2447980	2452460	I've been getting called in a few more times recently for stuff that's not exclusively for
2453260	2459340	a little person or that kind of thing and because like when you see a breakdown like as an actor
2459340	2465260	it'll say all ethnicities all shapes and sizes and they don't really I mean they don't they don't
2465260	2471660	fuck because because the writer wrote it and said uh she's tall she's uh she's nerdy hot
2471660	2475500	all right you know and like hot doesn't know it submit all ethnicities like that you like you
2475500	2480140	said blonde five times in that in that description right like I mean they're saying that the
2480140	2484860	corporation has to say that and I think there are I was I was about to ask the same question
2484860	2490780	that Dan just asked you are you seeing any opening up of that gate to them actually meaning
2490780	2497580	such things when they say that well I think they're the fact that I'm even getting in the room now is
2497580	2501180	it speaks to something is because you know with the age of technology and stuff you can look at
2501180	2506540	someone's entire thing without ever meeting them right and you know I don't pretend to know what
2506540	2511740	goes on in casting offices I've never been in like on that side but I feel like you know once
2511740	2515980	you look at someone's reel and you're like all right they're very clearly not what we're looking
2515980	2520620	for it helps you narrow down but hopefully yeah now they can come down to essentially what the
2520620	2525020	character needs to be as opposed to what they thought the the silhouette of that person needed
2525020	2530220	to be and I feel like as more young well not younger writers but like writers that are more
2530220	2537660	open-minded and that kind of thing become in positions of power where they can um you know
2537660	2542540	like create shows and that kind of thing by the way it'll have to be young writers because uh
2542540	2548300	ironically if you're over 50 you're not allowed to be a writer it's like not not like on a staff
2548300	2551980	like I've run up against that where it's like there's well there was a lawsuit a class action
2551980	2555500	lawsuit about ageism and writing room writing rooms I just thought it was I just wanted to dip
2555500	2559820	that in because the layers of irony that like I didn't know that it will be a young writer it
2559820	2563900	won't be an old writer because old writers are sitting at home going fuck society they fucking
2565340	2572220	tell me like yeah I know why you didn't hire me um the I it will start with writers and I
2572220	2577740	I know this firsthand and it's also like important for me to say this is a 180 degree
2577740	2584540	point of view 180 degree from when I was your age um when I was your age I was unemployed I wanted
2584540	2589500	to be the best writer in the world I wanted to save the universe with my words and I was also
2589500	2595820	without realizing it I was just like the voice of like you know holding things back because I
2595820	2601260	would get my writer's guild magazine which was being printed with the money that I didn't have
2601260	2605180	and it was like I broke my tooth last month but because I didn't do a rewrite on a beetlejuice
2605180	2610380	cartoon this month I can't get it fixed and and the money's going to like this glossy magazine
2610380	2615260	and every you know I open my mailbox and there's always some smiling ugly face looking at me
2615260	2618540	that's a successful writer who's this peanut-headed fucking oh that's just weird okay
2621260	2625180	in fact well what'd he do that's so great I traded buffing okay what else though all right
2625180	2632140	everything all right fine fine then I won't read your magazine why what what we're called writers
2632140	2637500	why are you making us read shit um but then when I would look through that writers hate reading
2639020	2643580	one of the one of the one of the bookmarks I have in my head of the 180 degree Harmon as a
2644060	2650300	politically as a writer is throwing literally throwing one of those WGA magazines across the
2650300	2655820	room because I had just looked at this sidebar item that was like called a report card about
2655820	2660540	diversity in writers rooms or something like that and I I saw the words and I didn't even see the
2660540	2666220	content I just threw it and it I it was I was doing it people think that the that the white
2666220	2671660	people that are doing that are doing it because they're racist uh like like it they're they're
2671660	2677820	doing it because they're they're they they're probably derived from privilege but it's a
2677820	2682140	combination of that and like fucking like underdog syndrome everybody's an underdog
2682140	2688140	so like I was like I'm the best writer in this fucking city and the union that represents me
2688140	2694860	is is is spending money and attention on a competition between who can hire more people
2694860	2700860	that have different shaped hats uh than who is the best writer and I when I would say that I
2700940	2706540	would imagine a chorus of super talented black writers behind me going fucking go man because I
2706540	2711660	don't want I don't want any fucking handouts and I want to be a good writer like I want to be known
2711660	2717180	for my writing too I was deluded the difference is I had to become a showrunner I had to be in
2717180	2723660	charge of hiring I had to have a stack of scripts on my desk and be like oh oh Harvard Yale Harvard
2723660	2728780	Yale Harvard Yale and be like like like oh there's a systemic thing and this cycle needs to be broken
2728780	2735020	at any point along the chain blah blah blah so like like the new thing now the bleeding edge of
2735020	2741180	this is like like oh it's like I just finished a script with Chris McKenna who would like
2741180	2745580	effectively ran community five and six with me and was like the reason why community is good
2746140	2752860	um we because we're old white men who are like in the twilight of our efficacy and just want to
2752860	2757740	like we want to write another good one you know and and like do everything right from square one
2757820	2762140	we're like writing this script together and we're having all these conversations going
2762860	2770060	like how do you like okay is it possible to write a gender neutral character um so far it turns out
2770060	2775580	the answer is no like it's fun there's I mean it's possible to write a transgender character
2775580	2780940	it's not possible to to like leave it up to the casting director without the script reading like
2780940	2787500	toothpick instructions I like it's like like pronouns are a fucking endemic to moving the
2787500	2793420	action like like like there's a way I'll try to get more talented but like ultimately what
2793420	2797820	I ended up doing is going this character when introducing the character this character can be
2797820	2805660	any gender um we're gonna call him a he to fucking get the script finished uh lately lately but it's
2805660	2809580	gender it's a gender neutral character what's important is their age sometimes what's important
2809580	2814380	is their age it's important that they're in their 20s because of the the dynamic that they'll have
2814380	2822380	with the person in their 40s um depending on the the situation uh we we we talked the entire time
2822380	2828300	I mean I have a point to all of this uh we talked the entire time is like you know these like noble
2828300	2833500	minded fucking like like middle-aged white writers were going like how do you accomplish this what do
2833500	2838460	you do like like and we kept the thing that we kept saying that having this like weird debate
2838460	2843100	about was like okay there's this this buffoon in the script it's the michael scott figure it's like
2843100	2849980	the he's the guy that you love to feel bad for slash hate he's got his foot in his mouth you know
2850780	2857260	like we would have endless conversations like it's like can that we know that can be a woman
2857260	2864620	if the actor is is is the right actor ultimately though as a as a comedian as a comedic writer
2864620	2871580	who worships at this altar that is so much higher is there a craft that you're betraying even by five
2871580	2878940	percent in the interest of like progress or anything should that buffoon is it is it is it
2878940	2884300	an extra five percent funnier if he's a straight white male is it does it go down five percent for
2884300	2892300	the sake of progress if your buffoon for instance is uh is a woman and the answer we'd never we very
2892300	2897420	happily like never came up with an answer so we just were like okay let's just keep thinking of
2897420	2903020	this guy we work with and using him as like in our heads and like let's just make sure when we get
2903020	2909180	if we start to get a pickup we gotta we gotta fight this battle in casting we gotta say get
2909180	2914060	christened wig in here and see if she can like do this like michael scott character yeah you wish
2914060	2921180	asshole uh the the uh no i wasn't i i have i make no eye contact and said you wish asshole to myself
2921180	2929100	you thought there was an asshole uh the um so here's the last part of my story that's a
2929100	2933660	cautionary tale for the future because it's it's still it's up to writers and it's fucking like
2933660	2937500	i was on the phone because we turned in the script and they're like this is awesome let's
2937500	2941180	get on the phone and talk about what actors to give this to and i'm like holy shit this has never
2941180	2946860	happened um like oh my god i can't believe we're talking about this guy and this guy and this guy
2946860	2951180	and this guy and this white guy and this white guy and this white guy and this white guy and i
2951180	2955260	didn't even it was like 40 minutes into the foot the conference call and i was like looking at
2955260	2964380	headshots and i was like this is a blizzard of talent a very talented blizzard i uh it's i am i
2964380	2974220	am my cup runneth over with ruds and uh and and and uh and then i and then i i had to like like i'm
2974220	2978700	not i'm not telling this story because i'm any kind of hero in it i'm telling the story as a
2978700	2984540	as a as a like because i was so i forgot i fucking forgot until halfway through the
2984540	2989500	conversation and then i was like oh yeah yeah wait wait and then i was like i was like what
2989500	2994380	we we you guys know right like have you ever had this conversation like like like is this something
2994380	2998860	that's unspoken casting directors have to run their thing like a target they have to know where
2998860	3004140	the where the big shirts are and the small shirts and the dark shirts and the checkered shirts
3004140	3008540	they have to if they don't know that they're part of their job as a casting director not the whole
3008540	3015100	job they're doing it wrong they have to be like a wholesaler of of corporeal humanity oh you want a
3015100	3021580	little person i got i know a fucking great actor who's a little person um you want the word little
3021580	3027420	person to change i it's out of my jurisdiction uh the but the other and and the other part of their
3027420	3031340	job is is like curating talent and going like no i'm not going to send you a little person who's
3031340	3037260	also a hack and all this shit and also hopefully going like look you said this character it can be
3037260	3044300	anything i i i'm sending you the the most like like like the the the best actors i have my
3044300	3050060	favorites like that's what cast good casting directors do they they already do that it starts
3050060	3054940	the the important thing that starts with the writer as much as it's the writer has to be like
3054940	3060940	if you're in tv they have to be like you're gonna think of like fucking white people from
3060940	3066220	your neighborhood if you don't if you don't like if i'm interrupting you like and do you want to
3066220	3071180	keep going you're interrupting me and you're a hero for it it's like the blue wire the blue wire
3072540	3078700	but like for instance the abed character you knew a guy named abed we are our friend uh the real
3078700	3086860	abed who is uh is he was he iraqi or iranian what is what does happen he's he's he's he's arabic
3087820	3094140	half arabic uh half like swedish or something and he is you know on some part of the spectrum
3094140	3097740	and whatever and you wrote this interesting character and you said i'm basing it on this
3097740	3103580	person i felt like it was important the regionality but danny danny puti came in who's indian half indian
3103580	3108060	have but but then but that's that's possibly a step in a direction it's like like because
3108060	3114380	your circle of friends stop being uh white dudes from mawaki and then white dudes from los angeles
3114460	3118380	whatever like you started to have a bigger group of friends you meet colin you meet more women you
3118380	3123580	meet people that like like you can start writing as a writer and say um i'm writing this around
3123580	3128700	an actual person that you should meet and then not that it needs to even be that person at the
3128700	3133740	at the end of the day when they when they cast it and when they make the show but you start like
3133740	3139900	focusing in like on saying like um the reason why we're doing this is not randomly trying to
3139900	3145900	be diverse we're writing this because i hung out at a bar with colin and the character doesn't
3145900	3151500	have to be uh i have dwarfism the i just think it's way funnier like because i've met him and
3151500	3155420	i talked to him and there's an essential quality here well this is a lazy answer but it's like
3155420	3162780	when when it's if if if what you're doing is really specific as in that example then go with
3162780	3168380	god and do that use that technique i wrote this for my uh small friend colin i had a conversation
3168380	3172140	with him and i have this vision of this character even though there's no mention of it in the script
3172140	3176540	like i it's important blah blah blah good definitely go ahead do that i i'm talking about
3176540	3181020	the other side of it is when you don't have those specific thoughts and you are picturing either
3181020	3192140	yourself or um steve correll uh you aren't doing anything wrong you're just not doing a thing that
3192140	3197580	if writers don't do it like especially writer producers you're doing what's very comfortable
3197580	3200940	for you you're trying to get the script so you should think of steve correll while you write it
3200940	3204300	but you should ask you so you should go through your script and go how many of these jokes are
3204300	3212140	based on him like uh like uh oh here it is like they need an extra bounce card but then the
3212140	3217100	complexion of his face like reflects the sun like there is nothing there's no bits like that like
3217100	3221740	it doesn't matter what it doesn't you but you should picture steve correll because you're
3221740	3226380	picturing like this funny person or this the person all these quirks but then you have to say
3227100	3231660	like to the casting director like and and the network in the studio you have to go like we
3231660	3236700	gotta like put we gotta exercise a muscle that's like not after feed whatever the word is when
3236700	3241740	it's like not even used we have to we have to we have to start doing crunches with this muscle
3241740	3248460	where we make sure that we're bringing the the that it's like a a cattle call and all the cows
3248460	3253820	like are coming in colin how often like how many times like or percentage wise when you go in for
3253820	3259660	casting is it specific to who you are and what you look like or how often is it not like do you
3259660	3264780	feel like it's honestly like they're open for seeing you like because they're really you know
3264780	3274220	it's like uh probably 70 percent it's usually because of my size 30 30 ish i'm surprised it's
3274220	3279580	actually 70 30 like i would have thought worse than that but yeah i mean like i mean my type's
3279580	3286380	not called for that much so i mean it's not like it would be skewed if like that type was called
3286380	3289740	for a lot more do you feel some sort of like movement in that direction like do you feel like
3289740	3295980	it's like yeah shifting into a more yeah i think it's it's for everyone i mean honestly like you
3295980	3300860	know for people different ethnicities for for different genders for you know different like
3300860	3305500	gender identities if we had if we had like an actor up here that was black and had dwarfism
3305500	3311580	what would he be like you fucking think you have a better i mean yeah probably honestly i've never
3311580	3316060	that that whole mediocre superpowers the question we're always asking ourselves man if i could conjure
3319260	3322860	and we were talking about this a little bit before i don't know if you remember but
3322860	3328380	like how a friend of mine once told me that i am both privileged and not privileged at the same
3328380	3334380	time which to be fair like when i'm walking around the streets in new york cops like smile right
3334380	3341340	they they they nod and like they they say they still something to say hi and what what about
3341340	3347340	chicago i've never been a chicago don't go there don't go there i've never i've never not wanted
3347340	3353500	a uh little person black uh person to to be around me but i've never wanted it more than
3353500	3358380	right now because i'm so fat i want to know like if yeah if you would say uh like like oh yeah
3358380	3365500	cops like i have no idea like i i wouldn't know and i'm not about to speculate yeah i mean it's
3365500	3369500	just because i'm i'm not in a position to say because i mean i would never you know like because
3369500	3373020	it could go either way it's like the cops are smiling at you because they're just like god
3373020	3380700	finally a stress-free encounter just for so you know like i'm capable or would do anything until
3380700	3386860	the first day you know isis will you know they're a little terrorist will i think you know what's
3386860	3390860	what's their story i think i remember seeing the story line is it is it is it is it is that you're
3390860	3398380	offended for i always sometimes i just want to check in with you guys i mean i would be offended
3398380	3405020	if isis was trying to capitalize on like being on diversity like like they thought that was gonna
3405020	3409420	make them more likable and then the crisis eventually would have more diversity than
3409420	3416620	paramount oh that would be fucking amazing did you guys see who crashed that bus into that
3416620	3425420	fucking school it was there was like it was a transgender um covered if i yeah i mean if
3425420	3432380	isis's only goal was to was to win to blow our mind fucking hit us where not our wallets because
3432380	3437420	you know we'll bail out corporations if they go bankrupt you can you can destroy as much
3437420	3441900	shit as you want but hit us hit us we're fucking thinking we're actually proud of ourselves
3443020	3447340	like have a have a bunch of beautiful post-feminist naked women like like like just
3447340	3453500	blow some shit up and and be like yeah i i accept my sexuality i have agency and i love isis
3453500	3462460	all right this is my friend the african-american sorry i'm sorry what african-syrian uh
3464060	3467580	uh little person he uh he fucking loves isis too
3468700	3473740	colin for me i'm gonna answer the question i'm gonna ask you first because if i if i've never
3473740	3477740	i've always wanted to be as an actor i want to be in a western i want to be on a horse
3477740	3481340	i want to be running like riding fast on a horse and shooting a remington and like i want to be
3481340	3486940	like in a western i love westerns what if you could be any role like do you have like like
3486940	3493260	like any character or style or genre that you'd like to be in um honestly i think that
3494380	3500060	what would make the strongest i mean like what i would want to do is probably like not something
3500060	3506540	that just a role that honestly just demonstrates an aspect of my humanity no i mean like like
3506540	3510940	anything in the world you know commute it's probably something comedic but like you know
3511580	3518300	in in the way that kind of broad city is doing where it's turning the you know how men treat
3518300	3523180	women on its head and that kind of thing yeah and it's like pointing out how stupid the comments
3523180	3531340	that men make towards women are and by like and there's this um uh you know the syrino
3531420	3536380	syrino vergic the how he's how he's how someone calls him big nose and then he comes up with all
3536380	3540540	these more clever things that they should say right and it would ideally be something like that
3540540	3546380	where it's where it's like turning in um one of my friends actually like because he's going
3546380	3550860	through something similar because he was like um he's he's trying to succeed as an actor and he's
3550860	3554940	black and he and we and he he makes height jokes towards me and i make black jokes towards him
3555660	3558700	and we have to we have to get demurge out here we gotta get demurge out here
3559580	3564940	dance at a partial orgasm it's it's dehuman dehumanization palooza
3566380	3570700	um okay this is the mortgage's favorite thing he'll be brought out as a representative of
3571980	3577900	of his race he loves that yeah i mean like i mean he'll make i mean like we we came with
3577900	3582060	you know some jokes that like other people can make and if it's okay i'd like to you know share
3582060	3586620	a couple of those you know like like if someone like he was saying someone could say grow up
3589580	3592620	and um that one went over your head and that kind of thing
3594860	3600700	but it's just it's just like more clever trends of phrases like that that are just not used by it
3600700	3604380	because it's just easy to make the obvious jokes and that kind of thing but you can talk shit with
3604380	3608620	your friends and like and like so like if you and i get like like we're closer friends like we we
3608620	3615180	could you could like diss me on what like anything any any flaw in my personality or anything i did
3615180	3618860	that night it's like it's fun to fire off with each other and i mean because there's there's
3618860	3625820	there's equality in and fun joking you know trash talk it's great yeah yeah well once you're
3625820	3632140	familiar once you get bored with shit that's what that's what progress is basically it's like speaking
3632220	3643660	of getting bored with shit let's bring out d'amore's brown
3653500	3659180	shake all the hands yeah i know that was a classy move like d'amore just like no one shakes
3659180	3664460	spencer's hand that's true i shake everybody's hand as they enter except for yours you just walk
3664460	3668140	right sometimes i want to be one of those guys that when he comes up i like i like shake the
3668140	3674860	hands of the front row like i i think maybe bon jovi did that i don't know i'm a cowboy
3674860	3684140	hi how are you i'm a steel horse i ride hey toby from michigan i'm wanted wanted stephanie
3684940	3691820	that's a great showbiz trick though and politicians use it all the time i was taken
3691820	3696780	from showbiz is the fake pointing to people that you see in the crowd yeah like you're
3696780	3701500	at madison square garden and there's 9 000 spotlights on you can't see shit but here you go
3704060	3709660	because springsteen's always like oh he's giving you that like and there's eight guys named tony
3709660	3715660	up in the fucking mezzanine like oh he's looking look what i mean i don't i never really thought
3715660	3724780	that that was fake i because i pick a because when i see people do that i i i always think
3724780	3731420	that's unprofessional this is just too personal but i just realized yeah because it's like i'm
3731420	3735580	thinking that like out of some like you know i'm not gonna diagnose myself but there may be
3735580	3740380	someone wrong and then like just do it do a half walk up on stage i just point if you
3740380	3746140	you can only see what the first five rows i can see yeah i see dave cline yeah but dave cline's
3746140	3752780	within that lighting dave cline has his own light artisanal lights dave cline is lit by his mother's
3752780	3758700	cesarean uh there's light pouring out of this of the sacrifice she didn't make
3758700	3768140	dude i think dave cline just beams that his beard emanates its own sort of uh
3769020	3772220	he's like one of those plates at your grandma's house that has jesus on it
3772220	3780300	it's just like he's lit by the anxiety you have for being an atheist and 11 years old
3781100	3787180	i think how you doing what's what's what's new in the dimarch brown world nothing man uh it's
3787900	3791260	february i've spent a year working on other people's projects so i'm sort of gearing up
3791260	3795900	to start making more of those weird shorts i make a lot of weird absurdist shorts under the name
3795900	3802060	black empowerment network uh right so it's time to make more of those and i think probably in
3802060	3805500	february i'll shoot like three of them i think three insane i see a lot of awesomely cinematic
3805500	3810060	photos of you like looking like you're on some sort of 35 millimeter set somewhere but it's just
3810060	3815420	it's just me working on other people's stuff yeah psychotic park ranger oh shit is he in the
3815420	3820380	revenants that's that's great that's a that's a beautiful shot have we ever mentioned gumball on
3820380	3825100	this show like on the on the podcast i don't know if you know not to me at least if you don't know
3825100	3830700	it uh is is that all channel 101 yes all channel yeah if you for those of you who do not know here
3830700	3836300	or listening go watch all of gumball and watch how good dimarch is it's really really i mean that's
3836300	3842380	that's a it's a short series that was done i think there's 11 episodes although the last one's 25
3842380	3849020	minutes long or something uh but it's uh but that was kyle ryder who uh and also matt froynd
3849660	3853980	and the three of us together just sort of saying what could we do that's absolutely insane and
3854860	3860620	it involves really good character driven yeah it starts off as like bronson meets arsenal meets
3861580	3865500	uh i think it was an excuse for you to wear your arsenal gear on camera right
3866940	3870780	i i would pitch that to kyle for everyone that we would shoot every month
3872380	3876700	maybe he's got this jacket on but also i kind of felt like sometimes he'd say yes sometimes he'd say
3876700	3881740	no like folding back on a question to colin uh because it also felt like in that gumball
3881740	3886220	series like that you guys collectively i always imagined we're talking about that you liked
3886220	3892220	movies like uh sexy beast or like that you liked like british indie movies and that it was beyond
3892220	3896700	like that we had grown beyond oh let's make a space movie because space movies are silly and
3896700	3901820	we'll only make our own space movie and they'll be silly it was like channel 101 had evolved into
3901820	3905980	like let's actually do what we really really really want we like the flavor of like this
3905980	3914380	actual like quality cinema that's being imported um yeah no i had uh i made kyle called me one day
3914380	3921420	i was when drive came out uh uh everybody was going crazy about reffin and i was like these
3921420	3928140	people haven't seen valhalla rising they haven't seen bronson uh they haven't seen pusher uh and
3928140	3931740	but everybody was saying that you know that drive was like the first movie that he'd made and
3931740	3935500	and um there were all these drive parodies coming out and kyle called me and he's like
3935500	3941260	i want to make something i want to make it with you uh but i don't want i don't want it to be
3941260	3944060	sort of referencing other things that other people have seen i really don't want to reference
3944060	3948380	anything we could start at a certain point and go from there have you seen bronson and at that time
3948380	3954300	i was watching bronson on youtube with swedish subtitles it was it was in english but i had
3954300	3959580	swedish subtitles and i was like yeah idiot i've seen it and i go he goes what if we start there
3959580	3963980	and then we just started with this thing where i was like what about the idea of a guy who sees
3963980	3971740	bronson and says that's my fucking life but that guy's life whereas the actual charlie bronson
3971740	3975980	where his actual life is worth a two-hour movie what if this guy's life is worth a five minute
3975980	3981820	short and he goes what would you name that guy and i go it'd have to be something really mundane
3981820	3986860	but also you know have some pop to it and the next day i just woke up out of the sleep and i said
3986860	3992700	whatever his name was bryant gumball he's just a guy who's named bryant gumball and we started
3992700	3998140	from there so i shaved my head for it and grew a circus strongman mustache and and then i said
3998140	4005100	he has to love arsenal and kyle was like yeah whatever man arsenal arsenal is an english soccer
4005100	4009100	team everybody it is the english soccer team it is the english soccer team is it number one right
4009100	4014140	now or number two no lester's on top there are three now lester's on top mate lester's
4014140	4019740	old fucking number one toss the table you can't so colin i'm just pretending i don't want to talk
4021820	4026220	colin just as an actor then because your first answer was just like oh you let him do that
4026220	4030220	that scene from rock sand where steve barton gets all the fucking big nose jokes out before
4030300	4036540	the bullies do but like the is there like a just as an actor like who what's the
4037900	4043420	like not not the action figure but what's the scene like like like what do you like i'll i'll
4043420	4048700	start and like like because he said you want to be a cowboy shooting a thing like i want to be the
4048700	4055820	the zuckerberg howard hughs like the i want to be uh the steve jobs like the the guy in the in the
4056300	4062780	scene you want to be a rich white guy i look it's what i'm good at uh no i want to be that
4062780	4068220	i want to be i want to be the guy that that that that people would love to fucking murder and and
4068220	4075580	they can't uh and and and like that that lives by his merit and that is is misunderstood misjudged
4075580	4080860	like i want to do those monologues where that are written by erin sarkin types who are like
4080860	4086540	like where you're just fucking like phrasing exactly like like like something that is not
4086540	4093100	likable necessarily but it's just like the verbal equivalent of the hulk bending a car in half and
4093100	4097740	shoving it up his own ass and then pulling it out of his mouth the size of a ping pong ball and
4097740	4103660	throwing it away um which is like in in in the social network is that moment when zuckerberg
4103660	4107340	like whatever that monologue is when he goes like everyone in this room has one thing everyone in
4107340	4112220	this room that wants to say they invented facebook has one thing in common they didn't
4112220	4117980	invent facebook i just i love that circuiting shit what it's not so it's like in terms of like the
4117980	4123500	tone of the the the sea like it's there like a fantasy of like like just as an actor like with
4123500	4127500	the kind of like monologue like what what what point of view the monologue might come from that
4127500	4133980	you feel like you could like nail i think something that yeah i i think it would be the long lines of
4134940	4140220	kevin spacie slash brian cranson from um house of cards and breaking bad respectfully when
4140220	4143660	they just say something like have a monologue where it's just so clear that they're such a
4143660	4151660	dangerous person and but they're about to go and make the people around them trust them right and
4151660	4156300	because i mean there's still i think something i could see as being a very good bad guy
4156940	4161980	like like like like a like a like a strangely horrifying bad like bad guy yeah but not like in
4161980	4172780	like a willow way bad guys come in all sizes i i i'm just talking about like eye contact like
4172780	4178860	like like the fact that like the the the best bad guys aren't the ones that look like like the most
4179500	4185660	like the the most like physically violent the ones that have like a like a a sublimated like
4185660	4191580	like an internal thing well who's the guy in the wire is like the guy like there's so many
4191580	4198540	like thugs in the wire that you're terrified of in different ways no it's the he you fall in love
4198540	4205100	with him because like like he fits in a fucking like ultimately like a spot in your tackle no
4205100	4209020	it's uh what's his name i can't remember his name the guy who wins i don't want to spoil the wire
4209020	4216620	the guy who's the last man standing marlo he when you when you meet him he's like he's he he
4216620	4221820	never raises his voice i don't think in the entire run of the show he's like and like it's
4221820	4226620	fucking terrifying because he's sending people out to kill people and yeah i mean would you
4227180	4233660	but you said because you said you used two examples used uh kevin spacey in uh house
4233660	4241500	of cards and and uh what's his fucking uh breaking about yeah brian cranson uh these are both these
4241500	4247100	are both people who need a chance you said and then they're gonna go out and prove well
4247100	4250940	they're gonna go you don't just want to like kick ass and like like intimidate because i mean that
4250940	4257340	would be bullying well i feel like that would be too obviously trying to say hey i can be a badass
4257340	4262140	oh hey look it's 180 degrees yeah like look how tough you want that you want that monologue moment
4262140	4267820	yeah i want that moment where it's like kevin spacey in uh in um jes what's that mammoth movie
4268140	4273340	foley james foley made a a mammoth play into a movie glen gary glen ross oh yeah where he starts
4273340	4277420	off as this guy everybody hates that's how you that's your path to remembering glen gary glen ross
4279260	4283980	yeah for me what's like if you said like gary kurt's produced this little ditty star wars
4287340	4294780	it was uh something that was based on a novella something death star wicked comes uh
4294780	4300860	uh that's my level man that's my level you're too you're too fucking educated so for me like
4300860	4308940	like when i watched uh uh alec baldwyn and malice when he gives the i do i have a god complex i
4308940	4313900	am god i'm a doctor like i like that it's like oh skillness right it's like that's a great bad guy
4313900	4318220	because he's he's the hero of his own movie and also he's pretending to be a bad i like that one
4318220	4324540	however so here's harman hairs to split in that movie malice is fucking great really rent rent
4324540	4328940	malice and check it out nicole alic baldwin bill bill pulmon yeah did i just mix up there
4328940	4333740	you got it right okay no it's it's it's really great as far as just like i mean popcorn eat
4333740	4341100	like thriller like twisty thriller uh the uh it's the bill pulmon it's not so much a monologue but
4341100	4345180	it's later the opposite side of the story circle from that where bill pulmon is talking to nicole
4345180	4350860	kitman and she says i'm not going to give any spoilers but she she says what do you want that's
4350860	4356060	the cue for his monologue and the end of his monologue is like i want half what the fuck do
4356060	4361740	you think i want um and and and and but it's like it's because he's it's the underdog thing and i
4361740	4366700	do think like like he's probably calic baldwyn was a doctor to begin with so he's like i'm special
4366700	4374060	and he's privileged like i as i mentioned earlier i think like the biggest problem uh the thing that
4374060	4379980	keeps hatred moving culturally in this country is the fact that donald trump right now somewhere
4379980	4385980	is tucking his little shitty head into a pillow going like oh today's chalk one up for the little
4385980	4392780	guy and he and he's and he's like writing a telegram home to his mom going mom i finally
4392780	4398620	got what's what i deserve i would fundamentally disagree with that i don't think he has that gene
4398620	4403340	in his fucking dna i think you're wrong i truly think you're wrong i don't i don't think people
4403340	4408060	behave that way i think some people behave that way like like there's there's a there's a but i
4408060	4413740	don't see it in him i think that it's actually more dangerous when like like people that have
4413740	4419660	all the power they like i can attest to it it's like it's it's everybody everybody that's 50
4419660	4425980	feels 25 and everybody with all the fucking power feels like an underdog they this that is like the
4425980	4430860	at the root of every argument you see flare up in every comment section under every unrelated youtube
4430860	4439180	video it's just like some guy holding a sparkler and the n-word is not far uh the guy is not black
4439180	4447100	the sparkler is not spelling the thing it's like the politics like fucking explode underneath this
4447100	4451020	thing and it's like oh these lib tards are gonna do this all right the right what the fuck is going
4451020	4456140	to the guy's waving a sparkler in a circle for 15 seconds yeah but dan that guy was totes gay
4456940	4463180	the reason though that the reason that pot keeps stirring is because of this like concept that
4463180	4469500	everybody it's capitalism's greatest success is that you're never spielberg is going to bed
4469500	4478140	somewhere tonight going like man if i could just have creative control for real or he wouldn't do
4478140	4484140	the shit he's been doing you think even after all this time if he was capable of going to bed one
4484220	4490460	night and going like i did it the next thing that would happen would be 60 of the greatest movies
4490460	4495180	shot on the shittiest camcorder in the world they'd be fucking great he's going to bed every night
4495180	4500140	going fucking sony god damn it next time next time i'm gonna get a fiber optic cable to my
4500140	4507020	place in the hamptons and i'm gonna make the dinosaurs myself and and and i want merchandising
4507020	4510380	merchandising because then i can funnel that into the special effects budget the line producers
4510380	4516780	not gonna fuck me this time and his wife is going like sweetie you're a genius yeah that's
4516780	4521580	what everyone says that's what everyone would say tell that to 20th tell that the fucking 20th
4522940	4526300	i want i want this movie to be made with colin playing you during the same
4527580	4533740	colin playing me yeah colin's playing me writing it he's the actor playing you you're he's he's
4533740	4538460	portraying this like this monologue and we got colin can play spielberg i'll play i'll play
4538460	4546700	your wife i'll just be going like sweetie stop come to bed spencer uh what monologue what scene
4546700	4555180	what genre what's what's your fantasy like if you could portray or anything yeah i'm a real i'm a
4555180	4559980	real actor at heart well i don't know when you watch a film do you get like like what kind of
4559980	4565100	scenes do you i like the guy who like reveals that he's the one like touching all the pieces
4565100	4569580	on the chess board you know he's like you know there's all these people and i was pulling the
4569580	4575420	strings forever you know like one of those monologues where you instantly reveal give us
4575420	4578940	a can you what's a for instance in film oh wait wait i mean i can't i don't watch i've got a good
4578940	4585580	one you you've probably never seen uh uh the peter johnson uh adapted glengarry glenn ross
4585580	4591500	uh the have you seen glengarry glenn ross no there's a there's a there's a everybody gets
4591500	4596540	a monologue in that movie but i feel like he he would want the kevin spacey one the the when he
4596540	4600780	takes jack jack lemon down right so copies when you go to lunch will you go to lunch will you go to
4600780	4606540	lunch will you go to lunch and then they cut the lemon and lemons just got this like cookie in his
4606540	4610700	hand he's like oh wait no are you are we talking about two different moments you're talking about
4610700	4615580	copies for closings when kevin spacey turns out to be the serious badass because that one just
4615580	4619340	happens to lemon in private and you realize oh this guy's a mother that's what i'm talking about
4619340	4623500	because he's saying like he likes to be the guy that you underestimated that turns out to have all
4623500	4632060	the yeah yeah yeah which is a cousin of mine but like second cousin but but the deception removes
4632060	4637500	me and then the alec baldwin i'm removed from because he already he was a doctor like the
4637500	4644780	the the medical association already accepted him i want to be a fucking raving i want to be john
4644780	4652460	the baptist fuck it jesus christ no wait he didn't get angry enough john the baptist
4653020	4658860	jesus got angry you know in a in a special what if version of the story where he cuts everyone
4658860	4664220	else's head off you know you'd be you'd be a good like if you had to remake like the the film the
4664220	4668140	the tent commandment is hilarious because you have every great over actor in one movie
4668700	4674940	but like harman you'd be good as pharaoh like a jewel grinner because you wouldn't be like
4674940	4678860	so let it be written so shall it be done you were like god damn it like fucking do what i told you to
4678860	4684940	do like you'd be more you you feel like god's giving you notes like i work how many how many
4684940	4691580	eagle face people do i have to worship to for locust not to eat my crops yeah i think you'd
4691660	4698380	be a good pharaoh yeah but he was wrong was he not as far as he was concerned yeah but
4699660	4706300	i mean oh you know how about just pilot how about like mark anthony like mark anthony i don't know
4706300	4712380	enough about the him he was a big sexy macho guy who fucked cleopatra i haven't seen wizard of us
4714220	4718940	you haven't seen or or cleopatra or read anything about cleo is that what he's in okay yeah i haven't
4719020	4726220	seen the classics i'm i've seen 13 things on the afi 100 and it's because the afi needed to round
4726220	4734380	it up to 100 so they put like die hard in there they're like this is only 70 i've never seen
4734380	4737900	american graffiti and people get on my ass about that but i just i never get up in the morning

4802460	4807580	it's just an all yeah yeah hanging out all night what was that okay american graffiti
4807580	4811660	dazed and confused i'm acting like this is a genre there was there was a thing
4811660	4816140	with robert woolen it called hollywood nights there was like that was in the 80s
4816860	4821660	i think you also have uh what's brand pressure in that too i think it's like her first movie
4821660	4825900	yeah yeah like i want to watch that again like like like like robert wool
4827900	4837260	oh dude these kids don't even know is arliss um let alone uh knocks from uh batman but but like
4837260	4844540	like like robert wool as the sexy senior in high school well the 80s you had footloose that's a
4844540	4851100	hanging out all night movie no no no no no you you uh you don't get it no footloose footloose
4851100	4855820	takes place over weeks and it's there's caucuses are you saying it has to be one night now one
4855820	4861980	like a 24 hour affair it's like it's like it's like oh you're gonna go super bad is the is the
4861980	4867100	is the newest one it's like it's different when it's a comedy and not like a indie movie kind of
4867100	4873980	like feel this time and place thing i see i think that i think that directors writers turn 40 and
4873980	4879340	then they go man when i was 11 and then they write those movies and then you're like this is cool
4880380	4885420	because you're 30 and you're like yay and then you and then you go into a back room and there's
4885420	4891420	just heads on the wall living heads but living heads and the neighbors keep complaining about
4891420	4895740	the smell how are the heads being sustained if they're just heads they're not being sustained
4896460	4902460	what they're living heads no i said i mean i meant i meant i'm a serial killer
4903340	4909340	to me they're living oh because you they talk to me they tell me who to kill next everybody the
4909340	4916380	exits are two to the rear no listen the more heads i add to the wall the more of an opinion
4916380	4922860	i get the less likely it is i'll kill again the less likely sony gives you notes on your dinosaurs
4923740	4928780	that would be an amazing serial killer gimmick like like as a guy who's obsessed with um like
4928780	4933820	populism egalitarianism or something so he's like the cops can't catch him because they don't he
4933820	4938140	doesn't have a profile like he's only killing like white women with red hair he's like trying to
4938140	4944940	gather this like he's trying to gather a sea of opinion because in his mind instead of the dog
4944940	4949580	telling him to kill people which is just has the shelf life because dogs whatever and also you're
4949580	4953500	crazy and you're gonna get caught dogs just keep saying kill the milkman the guy thinks
4953500	4958780	that if he if he puts enough heads on his wall the voice will tell him like like okay now you
4958780	4965500	can stop killing and so he keeps killing forever and the cops can't catch him because all serial
4965500	4969580	killer killer tracking is based on like these profiles and it's like the guy is just like i
4969580	4974620	don't i'll use a gun a hacksaw i don't care right and so he's just been doing it for 40 years and
4974620	4983260	maybe he has a really highly listened to podcast maybe it's a true story and maybe there's scenes
4983260	4990780	where you confesses it in full view maybe he's always hinting at it his love of mannequin legs
4994460	4996700	maybe one day his wife disappears
4996700	5004620	oh remember that joke about white red-headed people he seemed like a throw away when he
5004620	5011820	first said it all of a sudden she's gone where'd she go yeah by the way we haven't seen kameo in
5011820	5019980	a long time kurtish armstrong he's been fucking glaringly missing in action the worst if you want
5020140	5028940	to if you want to if you want to stop doing this podcast uh and and like like or feel that you
5028940	5034220	should like every like like like just go to the harmontown subreddit which by the way don't

5162700	5172460	it tastes you can't get alarmed it's designed for poisoning that's why russian people have poisoned
5172540	5177180	each other so fucking much because their food is just like well i don't know it's just russian food
5179900	5183020	you know if it was radiation poisoning i wouldn't be able to taste it these these

5190460	5195260	and and her like younger like partner and she's like you know it's so hard to profile
5195260	5198380	all these people keep disappearing but they're all over the country all over the map i'm not
5198460	5204300	getting any like profile but all of the beets and potatoes are disappearing from all the markets
5204300	5209500	right now or does it make a spot just borscht i got borscht all right never mind fucking
5210220	5218540	different movie anyways the worst thing in the world you on the harmontown subreddit right now

5225500	5230380	i it's not you saying i don't like this i don't like that that's not what it is
5230380	5235980	as far as my personal nightmare is concerned the uh and it's also it's not anybody going
5235980	5239820	because there's always a war going on between those people the people going like uh i think
5239820	5243020	it's great it's a free podcast why don't you shut up and then like why don't you just kiss
5243020	5249420	smash some more the worst the problem is the fucking war the battlefield because
5250460	5255580	both sides then it's just these conversations going on the people who are who love the podcast
5255580	5261820	going look i understand dan's a bad person he has a lot of flaws about himself but he never said he
5261820	5266860	was a good person i mean hell sometimes i find myself cringing or puking after a show there's
5266860	5271100	episodes that i've deleted from my hard drive because i never want to accidentally hear them
5271100	5279420	again all i'm saying is i want to win an argument with you don't do me any favors anymore
5280540	5284860	stop sticking up for me in arguments between you and someone who hates me
5285420	5294700	the fucking change hitting the floor is burning my skin when i was too young to speak my first
5294700	5301020	experience with this was my fucking brother and my mother would do nothing but incessantly argue
5301020	5306940	about whether or not i was special like it was like a fucking like just third person you're a
5306940	5313580	ghost in the room i'm just like i'll just can i keep sucking this uh but daniel doesn't have to
5313580	5319740	do that daniel's special no how come he shits his pants all the time well look i wish he'd stop that
5319740	5329180	but he's fucking smarter than you i know he's not i've been saying that for years daniel yes he
5329180	5334620	is he's way smarter than you no he's not come on his writing he's just fucking still sucking his
5334620	5338940	thumb you think he's a good writer i can fucking do that do it do it right now write better than
5338940	5345660	daniel oh oh he's a far far better thing that's tales of two cities you cocksucker go in the
5345740	5352060	basement and i have to be up here with a kid that can't stop shitting his pants that's how shitty you
5352060	5362380	are oh fucking shit god damn it oh god uh uh uh listen just stop shitting your pants so much and
5363500	5371580	third act problems with this last draft go to your room and write a story about a guy that showers
5371580	5378060	i was when am i going to get a break as a person that got pregnant out of high school
5386220	5393180	so anyways uh should we do a bit of role-playing or no because i the last one was pretty great
5393180	5398860	because uh nothing happened except we ruined another uh well we actually did isn't the last
5398860	5401660	one we all admitted were terrible shadow runners and we failed the mission right
5401660	5406380	something i mean something like that you were in a library i mean yeah well you guys went to the
5406380	5411900	library to find out about invisibility and whether or not invisibility works which i like that but also
5411900	5415900	could you you guys all have comm links on your heads couldn't you just access that like on your
5415900	5420220	phone you had to physically go to a library having been to the subreddit i think maybe
5421660	5425260	we could also move forward into a world where again this has been my goal for a while like
5425260	5429900	we can stop playing shadow run like we can i think we've proven that we're shitting at shadow
5429900	5433980	run yeah and i think we need to move into a world i'll be transparent about this i haven't
5433980	5438940	brought this up yet but i think like like the as far as like the role play somebody tweeted and
5438940	5443420	said oh spencer should be promoted device uh comptroller was like good because we got to stop
5443420	5448220	calling him game master because sometimes we don't play the uh the but i think we should like try to
5448220	5455420	figure out how to actually like move a segment maybe into the middle and or like we gotta like
5455420	5460300	get things down to like we gotta have people that are always here yeah because it's it's been too
5460300	5465580	diffused because the cast becomes six people that some of them aren't like kumail kurtis erin yeah
5465580	5470540	we're bringing people up like the golden age was you know because kumail was coming here every week
5471100	5477420	it wasn't that he was a better person than me he was just here all the time but it wasn't that
5477420	5482540	great i mean think about the days when kumail was here he was so funny i know he's hilarious
5482540	5487340	he's chucky there was a there was a there was a thread in the harmontown subreddit about how
5487340	5494940	much more likable justin roiland is than me oh do i have to bring him back on the show yeah
5495900	5500940	yes for you to see what i have to deal with
5500940	5507660	so what are you if we are we going to stop playing shadow run and move on to something
5507660	5515820	else and and justin roiland is a psychopath the fact that you don't know that is because he's a
5515820	5528220	good one hearts on my sleeve baby dino's like like albert schweitzer compared to him anyways
5528300	5531580	yeah thank you um thank you but i think i think grama's virginity might be coming back
5531580	5537900	like keep teasing oh it's back baby new episode dan what do you what do you what do you think
5537900	5545740	how would that how do we go forward yeah well let's pick okay so uh boy hey guys
5545740	5552220	spencer well you you you're a site being newly promoted vice comptroller okay uh or as far as
5552300	5559260	i'm concerned as far as i'm concerned yeah co-controller status like oh man vice makes
5559260	5563660	it sound like you are like you're supporting it to my controlling well i think i'll make that
5563660	5569820	call yeah he's supporting it he's he's i'm lower i'm down here this table is i'm off the stage i
5569820	5574940	think spencer needs to be more in this conversation than than i do but what how do you two think that
5574940	5579740	this should go forward mayor and vice com i think we should just start uh playing like a different
5579740	5588300	game like boxing straight up is that good podcast material i mean we certainly get our
5588300	5592940	boost our video we're trying to boost those sales it seems like people getting punched like drives
5592940	5598940	up the yeah i was i was thinking about it's a good old-fashioned bear baiting oh shit we'll
5598940	5603420	just have an animal up on stage and yeah but you get a bear and a pen and a bunch of rats and who
5603420	5609100	you bet on the rats or the bear i don't know we'll have to figure it out off stage yeah
5609660	5614140	the one thing i thought of is there's this game called fate i think uh adam has probably been
5614140	5619100	on her ass is to play that game forever adam goldberg everybody but uh fate is kind of cool
5619100	5624060	and it's it's more narrative and more fuck aroundy i don't know is it fantasy based or
5624060	5628460	more reality based the one i'm thinking of is called spirit of the century which is like pulp
5629100	5635740	pulp action kind of you know like 20s and fast talking detectives and mad scientistes and stuff
5635740	5641180	like that i don't know yeah i feel like yeah we never were like we only played shadow run for
5641180	5649580	like 32 seconds per week and we know what i'd really like to do is suck a big old dick yeah
5654220	5658460	the people that don't pay five dollars a month to subscribe to the video don't know that dan
5658460	5665020	didn't say that uh it's just like it's a personal issue but eating those balls
5670060	5680060	i'm dan harman for balls hell yeah but you just do uh do sam elliott doing a commercial for
5680060	5684460	eating balls you know all the glitters ain't gold
5691100	5693660	well there's one flavor i've come to know and love
5696220	5705340	balls it's what's for dinner how is this not a regular segment of the podcast sam elliott
5706220	5713660	i will do i will do local spots by sam elliott there's a place in northern colorado where the
5713660	5725260	river runs so deep you can stick your dick in it uh the uh i'm saying so just the it's the penny
5725260	5732940	part of me but i want to get a call of kathulu game going because because just to stick it up
5732940	5739180	thomas middleditch's ass because he belongs to hello i'm sam elliott for sticking up thomas
5739180	5745980	middleditch's asshole because he's got that he's got an asshole so deep you can put your dick in it
5748060	5753980	what is call of kathula it's just based in the universe of keep it in your pants dave
5753980	5759820	client keep it keep it together it's just it's just role playing based in the universe of hp
5759900	5766380	lovecraft that's all i can say it's a game that involves serious commitment to the flavor of the
5766380	5773100	universe this sounds like right up our alley yeah that's why that's very just all of it it's a very
5773100	5780780	tonal uh a game it's all about the horror and uh the paranoia of dealing with uh the ancient ones
5780780	5785580	all right let's let's the three of us talk about this off uh off stage when we'll come
5785580	5789580	we'll come at this in a way that we can come at this and know that if we end up playing call of
5790300	5793100	because that conversation got very uncomfortable for spencer
5794780	5800540	to the point where he he said look you can do this if you want it will be under protest i'll
5800540	5809820	still do it because i get paid so much spencer doesn't get paid are we would we would we
5809820	5814140	theoretically then be allowed to play that legally because harmon quest are we allowed well that's
5814140	5818140	what i'm actually trying to think of because as far as the letter of the contract goes it's
5818220	5823900	medieval fantasy that we shouldn't like like like that's what we're told but i think we can
5823900	5829660	honestly a phone call or not one and just breaking the rule no one's gonna sue us for
5829660	5833340	anything what if we got really into fantasy british premier league soccer
5833980	5839980	oh
5843500	5846620	i will tell you this for sure the most important thing to solve
5847820	5852940	is personnel like like like yeah we could we could engineer the game if we wanted where there
5852940	5858380	was a guest player but they would be designed to be always pocketed but it's like we gotta make sure
5858380	5862940	like people are reasonably always coming yeah because when we first started the very beginnings
5862940	5869420	of uh dnd it was you and i doing these little you know bite-sized things where we could you and
5869420	5873580	i could remember what it was kind of like a two-man little thing that's what those are the golden
5873580	5879020	yeah and i think we can maybe expand on that slowly modularly you can't role play for 15
5879020	5884300	minutes and with six people when four of them are like i have a purple mohawk and have never
5884300	5890140	seen this show what does the what do these words mean like and i'm like well i know everything
5890140	5894860	that's going on and it was in a blackout last time we played i think it's sad for me because
5894860	5898940	i really like i never got to really learn much about my character i really like designing eve
5898940	5903340	libbert team but i never got to do anything like it's like and not because like it was anybody
5903340	5907820	else's fault like i just we just never i never knew what the fuck we were doing i learned a lot
5907820	5918940	about norway i'm only i did research i think hortiguard was a rich tapestry uh also i think uh
5918940	5925180	the few times kurtis played dr friend he just he had no idea what was going on so he made
5925740	5931020	hard fast decisions that were like that were beautifully etched in marble like that was really
5931020	5939900	good he was also like tonally he was like look i don't want to talk about that i feel agony
5942300	5947020	he approached it like a like an actor anyways speaking of actors let's uh let's make sure
5947020	5951100	that colin colin have you ever done a role playing games before have you ever done like a dnd
5951100	5956700	yeah i've played dnd before yeah yeah like heavily or just a bit uh just a little bit yeah wasn't
5956700	5963820	really taken seriously that's how it goes yeah spencer how much have we broken your heart over
5963820	5970300	the years about it's not about not doing you any service it's not my heart so much as my spirit
5970300	5978140	you know it's like my heart's great it's always always doing fine that thread in the
5978140	5982060	that subreddit that i did click on because someone was like do we just come here to complain i was
5982060	5986060	like reading through it and going god damn fuck these people fuck fuck everything and then there
5986060	5990300	was a guy that said something like like well you know part of it is because they're just arguing
5990300	5994940	with each other well it's okay to hate on the podcast because dan doesn't come anywhere spencer's
5994940	5999740	the new dan he comes in every time someone says something bad and there's two people arguing and
5999740	6003900	then it was like spencer doesn't come in just to police people saying bad things spencer comes
6003900	6007420	into the blah blah blah and there was a guy like i think spencer this and then there was like a
6007420	6014300	spencer comment i was like why don't you just say you don't like me yeah nothing wrong with that
6015260	6019740	and it was like exactly what i was thinking spencer i was i was like yeah that's exactly
6019740	6027020	that is what i'm talking about vice controlling but it was exactly what i was i would have typed
6027020	6031580	like i was i was just like yeah what are you taught it's like but the thing is is there some
6031580	6038940	disconnect like it's not generational spencer's one of these fucking clones um like oh danny's
6038940	6047660	right now oh did i find out what makes you feel something um it's it's it's like what is there
6047660	6052460	something we're not getting about the internet that only the people that were here before the
6052460	6058620	internet understand which is that when in doubt fall back on what would make you a dick if you
6058620	6068140	were talking to the person face to face how is that not just the unspoken rule if somebody on
6068140	6074380	twitter is just like like i went to i i just like i went to amy schumer's uh uh twitter feed because
6074380	6080700	i was like she's gotta have this so worse than anybody like like and i was like i i i i like her
6080700	6085740	i gotta i gotta morbidly curious like i gotta just like look i'm gonna take a fucking crack
6085740	6092380	open the covenant arc and like just uh like like and i went to her feed and she the latest thing
6092380	6098140	she had posted was like a photo of her on stage it was taken from a low angle because it was taken
6098140	6105100	from somebody in the front row i think and uh so she captioned it uh keeping my chins up for charity
6105100	6110780	like self-deprecating first response uh just someone saying fat
6113500	6122140	so she can't respond to that she can't go hey fuck nut you're shooting me through a hole
6123100	6132540	i shot through that's why i'm famous like fuck you fuck you you piece of shit why are you trying
6132540	6137260	so hard to hurt me i've already fucking been vetted i already know how to hurt myself how
6137260	6143180	can you do this like why are you trying to hurt people and and if she said that then
6143180	6147740	not only would there be a bunch of people like lining up to go let me take a swipe at this
6148540	6151740	uh Harman you're fat i mean Schumer you're
6154780	6156300	i'm telling a story about Amy Schumer
6159420	6165260	uh not only that it's like those people aren't gonna say that it's the worst the worst part of
6165260	6172380	the fucking parfait is like people are going like like uh uh if she were as dumb as me and
6172380	6175900	bothered to respond to that shit there would there would be people not equating myself with
6175980	6182620	Amy Schumer by the way i'm personalizing the story only subconsciously the the the the like
6182620	6187740	like like this the people that would go like like uh amy i love you you need to get away from the
6187740	6197500	keyboard go fuck yourself fuck you why i don't make more money the more twitter followers i
