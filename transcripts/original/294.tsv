0	5760	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Harman Town at the lovely Dynasty Theatre.
5760	6760	My name is Brandon Johnson.
6760	10200	I'm sitting in for the lovely and beautiful Jeff Davis.
10200	12200	Please make some noise for him.
12200	14840	He's having throat surgery.
14840	16280	We miss him.
16280	19680	Watch me fuck his job up.
19680	28480	Let me welcome to the stage Spencer Crittenden, dungeon master, game master extraordinaire.
29480	32080	Ladies and gentlemen, it's air conditioned in here.
32080	38880	It's so much hotter wherever you are, but it's super hot because tonight we've got Dan Harman,
38880	42880	the mayor of the Harman Town!
45880	46880	Yeah!
46880	48880	Let him hear you.
50880	52880	Thank you.
52880	54880	Thank you for coming.
55880	58880	Thank you, Brandon Johnson, guest comptroller.
58880	60880	Yo, oh, yo.
60880	62880	Yo, yo.
62880	64880	Yo, yo.
64880	66880	Yo, yo.
66880	68880	Yo, yo.
68880	70880	Yo, yo.
70880	72880	Rapping on the beat.
72880	76880	Literally on the beat.
76880	80880	I'm rapping on the beat.
80880	84880	My literariness can't be beat.
84880	88880	I'm rapping on the beat.
88880	92880	And my name is MC Street.
92880	96880	And I rap with some beats.
96880	98880	A plate of them.
98880	100880	They're called beats.
100880	104880	Rapping on the beat.
104880	108880	Rapping from the street.
109880	111880	Can't be beat.
111880	113880	These beats per minute.
113880	115880	Can't be beat.
115880	117880	I mean, I chose to.
117880	119880	All right, yeah.
119880	120880	Thank you.
120880	121880	Thank you, guys.
121880	123880	Thank you.
123880	127880	It is kind of going to be more of a musical night.
127880	131880	I mean, Jesus Christ, is this Mike?
131880	133880	Steve Levy, ladies and gentlemen.
133880	135880	Steve Levy.
135880	137880	Oh, God.
137880	139880	So Star Pack tonight.
139880	141880	It probably will be a little bit of a musical night,
141880	146880	because I've been working out on Instagram Live, as you all know.
146880	151880	And I play a workout mix while I work out.
151880	154880	And I work out to the beat.
154880	160880	And Instagram started doing this Instagram TV thing.
160880	161880	Because of what you were doing.
161880	162880	Probably.
162880	163880	Yeah.
163880	167880	Also, I think that kicked in a new higher wave of copyright detection
167880	168880	or something.
168880	171880	So my workouts, when I work out alone,
171880	175880	and the trainer's not there talking over stuff.
175880	178880	I've done enough experimenting, I think,
178880	181880	to realize that it's right around the Foo Fighters.
181880	184880	Some AI thing gets triggered.
184880	185880	And it shuts off.
185880	188880	And it suspends my Instagram feed.
188880	191880	So I thought, well, I mean.
191880	194880	Is it because dudes will bootleg music based off your workout?
194880	196880	Because that's what people do.
196880	197880	I don't know.
197880	198880	I have no idea.
198880	199880	It's bullshit.
199880	203880	I imagine it's just what's fair in love and war
203880	204880	and copyright infringement.
204880	207880	It's like the technology started allowing us
207880	209880	to steal music really quickly.
209880	211880	And there was nothing anybody could do about it.
211880	214880	Metallica wanted MP3s to be illegal.
214880	216880	And we laughed at him.
216880	220880	We call him Metallica.
221880	223880	And it was like, oh, old man, don't you get it?
223880	225880	But it's 20, 30 years later.
225880	228880	And now it's actually kind of like the pendulum swinging back.
228880	231880	It's like, shit, I can't play Foo Fighters
231880	235880	in the background at my party because the robots are better
235880	237880	able to recognize music.
237880	239880	That Shazam technology represents computers
239880	242880	are able to pick up on a Cyndi Lauper song
242880	244880	on the background of a bar.
244880	246880	And I think that's what's happening,
246880	249880	is that they just, it must be certain bands.
249880	251880	I always start with the Rocky theme.
251880	254880	And I guess nobody gives a fuck.
254880	256880	I don't know if it's per song or like gotta be.
256880	258880	It's a type of music.
258880	260880	Because you can steal, it's the type of music
260880	262880	because you can steal hip hop all day long.
262880	264880	Yeah, it's weird that Foo Fighters is,
264880	266880	or it's not weird, I guess.
266880	268880	They're probably, out of everything in my playlist,
268880	270880	I guess they're probably the most,
270880	273880	I don't know what the adjective would be.
273880	276880	I'm sure you could trace it to the label or something.
276880	279880	This label is really litigious or enforces it or something.
279880	282880	Well, anyways, I'm not gonna get mad and go,
282880	285880	fuck you, old man, I'm entitled to steal your music.
285880	288880	If I'm broadcasting on Instagram, that's it.
288880	292880	So I took the beats per minute of each of the workout songs
292880	295880	and I'm starting, I'm gonna use GarageBand
295880	301880	to make sound-alikes of the songs.
301880	305880	So you are really, really ripping off somebody's music.
305880	307880	Basically.
307880	310880	But not in a way that I think they would agree was costing them money.
310880	313880	Unless I was like, I really gave them full credit
313880	316880	and was like, this is the Foo Fighters.
316880	319880	The Foo Fighters inspired this song.
319880	322880	And I just broadcast that and kill it.
322880	324880	And then their lawyer calls and goes like,
324880	327880	please just use the song.
327880	329880	Use the regular song.
329880	331880	No, I love the Foo Fighters.
331880	333880	I want to help.
333880	337880	I'm Justin Roiland.
337880	343880	This is Rob Schraub's impression of Justin Roiland.
343880	345880	It's the only one that I do.
345880	349880	It's the only impression of Justin Roiland I have.
349880	352880	It's Rob Schraub's.
352880	354880	Yeah, so I don't know, let's see.
354880	361880	So according to Levy, if I just hit this
361880	366880	and then that, and then air server, okay, yeah.
366880	368880	Am I not supposed to say that out loud?
368880	371880	Now everyone can probably...
371880	375880	Well, you definitely should have said that out loud.
375880	378880	It makes sense.
378880	379880	It's good.
379880	380880	Oh, look at this.
380880	382880	No technology.
382880	385880	But y'all can't bail me out of jail.
385880	386880	Okay.
386880	388880	But don't play the video because I'm nervous
388880	391880	because I didn't scrub my iPad for porn.
391880	393880	If you can not play the video from my thing.
393880	397880	But I usually start with X going to give it to you.
397880	399880	I start with the Rocky theme, which again,
399880	402880	I think is how I start and it's not getting shut off.
402880	406880	But then, so this is...
406880	410880	I mean, I just got the beats per minute, you know,
410880	415880	and let's see, is it playing?
415880	416880	No?
416880	417880	They should be able to hear, yeah.
417880	419880	Now, is this your version of X going to give it to you?
419880	420880	Yeah.
420880	422880	I can't believe I just said gonna.
422880	423880	I did the right beats per minute.
423880	425880	X gonna give it to you.
425880	428880	Oh, wait.
428880	429880	Is it...
429880	431880	So you guys aren't able to air play it?
431880	434880	I could just do it on the speakers on the device.
434880	435880	Yeah, that might work.
435880	441880	It's probably going to work mostly.
441880	442880	Well, yeah.
442880	443880	See, that's the thing is if I can...
443880	446880	We can get the runtime for X going to give it to you.
446880	449880	Sorry, I know it's below your pay grade.
449880	450880	This is a great...
450880	452880	If you get the runtime, then we can...
452880	455880	Tonight, we can record in time for my workout tomorrow.
455880	456880	Well, let's do it.
456880	457880	That sounds like a good angle.
457880	458880	I'm sure everyone's...
458880	460880	They're like, oh, great.
460880	461880	Well, they're already here.
461880	464880	They really came for the right show.
464880	469880	So surprised that no one in the audience just yelled it out.
469880	470880	No, no, no.
470880	471880	I like that.
471880	473880	I mean, it would have been useful now,
473880	477880	but on the whole, it would have been terrible if they did that.
477880	478880	Oh, shit.
478880	479880	Yeah.
479880	481880	You're thinking, it doesn't sound like X can give it to you.
481880	484880	Well, it's just like, it's not supposed to sound that much like it.
484880	485880	You know?
485880	486880	It doesn't want to be...
486880	488880	And you're like, where are those horns, right?
488880	489880	I got 336.
489880	491880	I have like the synth horns.
491880	493880	Is it supposed to not sound like it?
493880	502880	Because it's amazing at that.
502880	504880	Don't get it twisted.
504880	507880	Don't get it twisted.
507880	515880	This rap shit is hard.
515880	519880	Yo, X giving it to you.
519880	521880	He's about to...
521880	523880	Prudicious taking it back.
523880	524880	X giving it to you.
524880	526880	Yo, I'm a dog in heat.
526880	531880	Yo, everybody on the street wants somebody from me.
531880	533880	You can't have it.
533880	536880	I worked hard for it.
536880	539880	What you going to say when someone works this hard for money?
539880	540880	Give you some?
540880	542880	No.
542880	543880	You don't get any.
543880	546880	I get it all.
546880	547880	You want to talk to somebody?
547880	551880	Talk to my tears.
551880	554880	Okay, well, we can do the rest with our guests.
554880	557880	DMX is going to fuck us up for that.
557880	558880	No.
558880	559880	Yeah, he's going to find it.
559880	560880	You don't think it sounds that much like it is?
560880	562880	He is going to fuck us up.
562880	564880	I tried to make it sound different.
564880	568880	I couldn't tell the difference between you and him.
568880	569880	It's incredible.
569880	570880	You know what's really funny?
570880	573880	My dog, Harvey, who...
573880	579880	He barks at cartoon dogs on the TV and Danny DeVito and...
579880	580880	I swear to God.
580880	583880	And the...
583880	586880	When I play the X going to give it to you, it starts.
586880	588880	There's a beat and he goes like...
589880	591880	And Harvey goes like...
591880	594880	DMX would be so stoked about that, right?
594880	596880	He'd be like, I fooled a dog?
596880	599880	He's into dogs.
599880	604880	That would be like if you told Batman that a bat tried to fuck his bat suit.
604880	608880	If Batman came home and Alfred was like, spot of bother, sir, while you were gone,
608880	613880	I'm just cleaning the guano off the shoulder pads of your Mach 2 battle armor.
613880	614880	Why is that, Alfred?
614880	615880	Why?
615880	619880	You don't have to speak to me in that affected gravel.
619880	620880	Why, Alfred?
620880	621880	What's going on?
621880	622880	That's the real voice.
622880	628880	It appears a male bat mistook your suit for a female bat.
628880	635880	Whoa, I don't see gender, so that's awesome.
635880	638880	He'd be stoked because he's like, Alfred, don't you see what this means?
638880	639880	Yeah.
639880	640880	Yeah.
641880	645880	The ancient Greek scientist and artist Daedalus,
645880	650880	one of his highest accomplishments that he would brag about the most
650880	655880	is that he once made a statue of Hercules so realistic that Hercules threw a rock at it.
657880	659880	Because that is what you do if you saw you.
659880	664880	It's such a perfect carryover to celebrity and cinematic culture.
664880	667880	Daedalus is the screenwriter and he's like, yeah, you know what?
667880	669880	I made Sylvester Stallone have a fucking heart attack.
669880	671880	It's my story.
672880	677880	Just having nothing but contempt for these people that look better than you.
679880	681880	I came out here to puppet them.
681880	684880	You made a little video over the weekend?
685880	686880	I did?
686880	687880	Did you?
687880	689880	Or was that further back?
690880	691880	That video?
692880	694880	Oh, you made the thing with Shrob?
694880	695880	Yeah.
695880	696880	That was a beauty.
696880	697880	That was a blast.
697880	699880	Did you guys get to see that?
700880	702880	You really own Shrob.
704880	706880	I don't want to punish you for experimentation.
706880	707880	Yeah, you know the tools.
707880	710880	You're like, maybe that would be great.
710880	711880	I saw like 20 likes.
711880	713880	I figured some of those people.
714880	721880	Let's bring out our friend, our old friend, our young but old friend,
721880	723880	Mr. Andy Kindler.
724880	726880	Andy Kindler.
734880	737880	He can sit in any of these chairs.
737880	739880	You can have any of those.
748880	750880	That's a classic.
750880	752880	This is scary, what are you?
752880	754880	Mike Douglas?
755880	757880	You know what I mean with the tall stools?
758880	759880	What am I trying to say?
759880	760880	What is this?
760880	761880	The Mike Douglas show?
761880	762880	Right, John Lennon?
762880	763880	You got it.
765880	770880	My favorite line of all time, like you in the midst of a what am I spiral?
770880	772880	What am I, the what am I guy?
772880	775880	Who am I, the guy who says what am I?
775880	777880	What am I this guy?
777880	779880	This guy knows what I'm talking about.
779880	781880	That lady, she doesn't know what I'm talking about.
782880	785880	The Presbyterian in the back is wishing he was in the front,
785880	788880	and the Catholic guy is starting up the scooter.
788880	790880	This is kind of Rickles life.
793880	795880	How do you drink this?
795880	797880	How do you drink this?
798880	799880	No, but where is it?
799880	803880	I mean, it's like even when I do stand up, they have like a nice stool.
803880	804880	Yeah.
804880	805880	Oh, yeah.
805880	806880	You know what?
806880	807880	We do need little tables, don't we?
807880	808880	Yeah, it's ridiculous.
808880	810880	I don't care.
810880	814880	People, yes, babies are getting ripped from their mothers.
814880	817880	I don't have a place to put my goddamn drink.
817880	820880	I'm not saying one's worse.
820880	821880	I like when cable news says...
821880	823880	We're just talking about things we hate.
823880	824880	Right.
824880	826880	There's nothing wrong with that.
826880	829880	Well, isn't it really the Democrats that made it impossible for you to put your drink down,
829880	833880	or wasn't the show just carrying through the rules?
833880	834880	I won't say.
834880	841880	I always say Democrat Party, because Frank Luntz said it was a good tactic.
841880	843880	You know they say that all the time?
843880	844880	No.
844880	850880	They're so evil, and they're programmed so evil, that they just accept these things.
850880	853880	They won't say the Democratic Party.
853880	855880	They only will say the Democrat Party.
855880	856880	Oh.
856880	859880	Because Democratic Party would make it sound as if they're Democratic.
859880	860880	I see.
860880	865880	But Democrat Party, it doesn't even work really as a propaganda.
865880	866880	No, but they're trying.
866880	867880	They've got to give it to them.
867880	870880	But it works to signal that you are a horrible human being.
870880	872880	It's preemptive propaganda.
872880	878880	It's not like they believed that calling it Democratic was actually gaining any ground,
878880	884880	but they're just spraying a little ant poison in that area, just to keep a line from...
884880	885880	But Frank Luntz did, though.
885880	887880	He thought it was...
887880	889880	I'm a little raspy tonight.
889880	894880	I work as a Rod Stewart impersonator, normally.
894880	897880	Tonight's the night.
897880	898880	I can't do the whole thing.
898880	901880	Everything's all right.
901880	904880	Did you see that he finally broke his silence on the whole urban legend?
904880	908880	Because when you hear the words Rod Stewart, what's the first thing you think of if you're over?
908880	915880	I wish I could get the eight rumors I know out of my head.
915880	917880	I mean, I know they're true things.
917880	918880	It's like somehow...
918880	919880	Well, they're not.
919880	920880	I mean, Rod Stewart...
920880	921880	Oh, not that one.
921880	922880	Not that one.
922880	925880	Not that one, but there's a couple of them, like Chuck Berry.
925880	927880	I don't even want to get into it.
927880	930880	There's things I've heard that I wish I could unhear.
930880	932880	But they said that Rod Stewart...
932880	938880	Oh, I'm the bad guy, because some people are into fetishes, and I'm not saying he was.
938880	939880	No, he didn't.
939880	940880	He did.
940880	941880	He did.
941880	943880	He did have to go to the hospital.
943880	944880	No, he didn't.
944880	945880	He did.
945880	946880	No, Rod Stewart.
946880	947880	He had to go to the hospital.
947880	948880	That sounds...
948880	949880	He had to go to the hospital, yeah.
949880	950880	He had to have his...
950880	951880	He had to have his...
951880	952880	He did have to have his...
952880	953880	He was really sick.
953880	954880	He could go to the hospital at one time, yes.
954880	955880	He had...
955880	956880	They had various operations.
956880	963120	I didn't want to have my appendix out, so nobody started a story about gerbils based
963120	964120	on that.
964120	968800	And when I say gerbils, I really mean gerbils.
968800	969800	Think about it.
969800	970800	Think about it.
970800	973880	There was this urban legend that Rod Stewart went into a bar one night, and he hung out
973880	979440	with the Navy, and then the next night at his concert, he fainted on stage, and they
979440	981640	rushed him to the hospital, and they pumped.
981640	986080	And then the numbers get really specific about the number of quarts or ounces of semen or
986080	987840	urine that they pumped out of his stomach.
987840	990800	It collapsed from being too full of semen.
990800	991800	Everyone knows this.
991800	995320	And it was like this really enduring rumor, because there was no internet at one time.
995320	996320	Because it was true.
996320	999720	So you got all your news through your babysitter while they were washing their Camaro.
999720	1004080	That was the only way you got any information about the world.
1004080	1005080	And that was the internet.
1005080	1011640	And it was like, the Rod Stewart song would come on and go, take a chance, baby.
1011640	1012640	What song is that?
1012640	1013640	What song is that?
1013640	1014640	I don't want to infringe on anything.
1014640	1015640	I made a...
1015640	1016640	Come on down, down, and take a chance.
1016640	1017640	We're going like...
1017640	1018640	Oh, come down, down, baby.
1018640	1020640	And take a Rod Stewart sounded song on you.
1020640	1021640	You sound like Bob Seger.
1021640	1022640	You don't know Bob Seger.
1022640	1023640	I'm Bob Seger.
1023640	1024640	Shake down, take down.
1024640	1027760	Everybody wants another walk of life.
1028760	1029760	Shake down, shake down.
1029760	1030760	Hooked off, you busted.
1030760	1031760	Well, well.
1031760	1032760	Shake down, street.
1032760	1040760	I just like the idea that two to three quarts of semen is a medical emergency.
1040760	1041760	It is.
1041760	1044600	It's enough to make you collapse.
1044600	1048960	It's not just like you don't want to lay down.
1048960	1050920	You need to go to the hospital.
1050920	1051920	That's right.
1051920	1052920	That's how...
1052920	1053920	It's the middle of a concert.
1053920	1054920	Wake up, Maggie.
1054920	1055920	Oh, no.
1055920	1056920	Oh, no.
1057080	1058080	I'm sorry.
1058080	1059080	I'm not feeling well.
1059080	1060080	Sorry, blokes.
1060080	1063080	From all the courts of semen that I'm supposed to leave.
1063080	1064080	I've got to lay down.
1064080	1065080	Consume.
1065080	1066240	How do you even consume semen?
1066240	1069320	I've tried.
1069320	1070320	So he eventually...
1070320	1071320	You can't get it on a fork.
1071320	1072320	He kind of...
1072320	1075560	That was me doing a gay homophobic kind of joke.
1075560	1077320	Like, hey, I'm gay?
1077320	1081160	That was a shock.
1081160	1083080	He let the rumor float for a long time.
1083080	1084080	He didn't touch it.
1084080	1085080	Well, because he wouldn't dignify it.
1085080	1086080	Yeah, exactly.
1086240	1087240	He didn't want to dignify it.
1087240	1088240	He was classy.
1088240	1089240	Rod Stewart about it.
1089240	1092480	And then I think maybe because the guy that started that rumor died, I think.
1092480	1093480	Oh, so we know Rod Stewart...
1093480	1095480	Of too much semen.
1095480	1096480	Yeah.
1096480	1097760	He finally addressed it in an interview.
1097760	1102680	He said, look, the guy that started that rumor was my publicist.
1102680	1103680	And he got...
1103680	1104680	That was his publicist?
1104680	1109320	He got pissed off at me because I fired him for really pervy, creepy reasons.
1109320	1115880	He had sex with a groupie in a room that Rod Stewart's underage daughter was sleeping
1115880	1119360	in, in a hotel room.
1119360	1121560	And he found out about it and fired the guy.
1121560	1124360	He was like, you don't do that in the room where my daughter's sleeping.
1124360	1125360	And the guy...
1125360	1129400	And Rod Stewart was really cool about it going, yeah, and then that was his way of getting
1129400	1130400	back at me.
1130400	1132360	And you gotta admit, he was good at his job.
1132360	1135080	It's quite a PR guy.
1135080	1137440	I'm famous for drinking two quarts of semen.
1137440	1140960	I gotta eat platinum albums.
1140960	1144280	One thing I did that everyone knows is I drink two quarts of semen.
1144280	1146280	He's a fucking genius.
1146280	1151360	Well, you know, that I would...
1151360	1152360	Here's the thing.
1152360	1160560	I would never commit suicide, but if people really thought of me, every time they thought
1160560	1163800	of me, that's the guy who drank the semen, I'm gonna put a bullet in my head.
1163800	1164800	I know.
1164800	1167600	I can't believe any of these people live after these rumors.
1167600	1169200	It's amazing that somebody's...
1169200	1173440	That's inspiring that he would be that confident enough to just be like, what are you doing
1173440	1174440	in love?
1174440	1176240	I'm reading the paper, governor.
1176240	1180320	Oh, baby, don't be a piffler.
1180320	1185080	Puss wind me some wainscotting, give me a taste, well, let me wet my beak of the news,
1185080	1186080	love.
1186080	1190800	Oh, well, you know, I don't know if you want to hear all the news today, cheeky Robbie
1190800	1191800	baby.
1191800	1192800	Oh, come on, love.
1192800	1194400	Are you doing British people?
1194400	1198400	Yeah, yeah, it's a British couple in their flat, which a flat could be anything.
1198400	1199400	It's like...
1199400	1200400	He must be like...
1200400	1201400	Like putting in flat means...
1201400	1203400	It's a cockney thing, right?
1204160	1206640	Give us some news then, love, be a bird.
1206640	1207640	Jesus.
1207640	1208640	Oh, well, if you insist...
1208640	1209640	Be a bird?
1209640	1210640	Yeah.
1210640	1212640	It says you drank two quarts of semen last night.
1212640	1213640	I changed her into...
1213640	1214640	She's just...
1214640	1215640	I don't know.
1215640	1216640	She turned into Harley Quinn.
1216640	1226200	It says you drank two quarts of semen, Mr. S.
1226200	1231160	She was Edith from all in the family, stopped by.
1231160	1236120	And then Rod Stewart's response was, huh.
1236120	1237120	How many...
1237120	1238680	Is that just in the post or...
1238680	1242760	No, it's the Montana Gazette and it's everywhere.
1242760	1247480	It seems you're famous for one thing, drinking two quarts of semen.
1247480	1251840	Well, I'm gonna go golf.
1251840	1255040	I would like to update that about the suicide thing.
1255040	1259520	I wouldn't commit suicide if maybe I was Rod Stewart and had that kind of self-esteem.
1259520	1260520	You know what I mean?
1261400	1266600	But don't we draw from this, if we want to become Rod Stewart, we gotta imagine ourselves
1266600	1269600	as people so strong that you could say we drank two quarts of semen and we wouldn't
1269600	1270600	even fucking blink.
1270600	1273920	We would just be like, when's my next tour?
1273920	1274920	Get me out there again.
1274920	1275920	I wanna...
1275920	1276920	Yeah.
1276920	1277920	I'll drink three quarts.
1277920	1278920	I don't think...
1278920	1283920	You're not gonna see that turn up at any triathlons anytime soon as part of a...
1283920	1286120	I don't know, is it doing a joke?
1286120	1289520	Swim a river, then you drink semen, and then you run.
1290520	1291840	I'm not blue.
1291840	1292840	The subject was blue.
1292840	1294840	Yeah, the subject is a dirty subject.
1294840	1295840	It's a filthy subject.
1295840	1297560	Andy's happy to work clean.
1297560	1298560	I work...
1298560	1299560	And TV clean.
1299560	1300560	Yeah.
1300560	1301560	Plus, I mean, nobody's working.
1301560	1302560	We don't know.
1302560	1303560	I mean, don't...
1303560	1306280	What do you think made him finally, because the guy died?
1306280	1307280	And where did you see it?
1307280	1308280	It was in an interview.
1308280	1309280	It was just like a...
1309280	1312280	I wanna say a vanity fair or a rolling stone.
1312280	1313280	I don't know.
1313280	1314280	I don't know.
1314280	1315280	Sorry.
1315280	1316280	I hope it wasn't a reels.
1316280	1317280	Like a reels.
1317280	1318280	I hope so.
1318720	1320800	Doc, have you seen a real...
1320800	1323640	I watch nothing but a true crime.
1323640	1326000	Don't worry about it.
1326000	1328200	I'm not committing true crimes.
1328200	1330840	I have OCD, so I think I might...
1330840	1331840	So I...
1331840	1332840	Did I commit...
1332840	1335080	Do you know that I lived...
1335080	1336560	I lived in Citrus Heights.
1336560	1337720	I live in Citrus Heights.
1337720	1343040	I worked as a comedian in Citrus Heights at the same time period with the Golden State
1343040	1345240	Killer, you know, right?
1345240	1346240	Did I help...
1346240	1348160	Did I help him and I don't remember?
1349040	1350040	Did I...
1350040	1353520	You know how when you're young, something sounds like a good idea, but then you get
1353520	1354520	there?
1354520	1355520	You're not sure if you...
1355520	1356520	Yeah.
1356520	1362040	Or worse, did I get amnesia like a 70s TV show and I don't remember?
1362040	1363040	You know what's something they say on...
1363040	1366240	I watch a lot of true crime too.
1366240	1367240	You know what's something...
1367240	1369240	I was thinking about this today.
1369240	1371840	Like, here's a myth I would like to...
1371840	1377160	Well, maybe it's not a myth, but it's just like when something is so accepted as true,
1377160	1380880	like sometimes you just want to be the person to disrupt it, question it a little bit.
1380880	1381880	Yeah.
1381880	1384120	Like, this thing, it's just like there's...
1384120	1390120	No matter what kind of parent you are, if your child dies, like the one thing that every
1390120	1394320	parent knows to do, like there are some parents who will go to the airport and shoot the guy
1394320	1396320	that killed their kid.
1396320	1397320	Why the airport?
1397320	1399040	And be like, I don't fucking care.
1399040	1400040	You do it.
1400040	1401040	You do it.
1401040	1402040	Why the airport?
1402040	1403040	I was thinking too.
1403040	1406240	Because he's being flown back in because of extradition laws, because he killed your
1406240	1407240	kid and went to Brazil.
1407240	1408240	Not trying to get away.
1408240	1409240	Why you can't just wait for the courtroom?
1409240	1410240	Not trying to get away.
1410240	1414120	Why do you have to go all the way to LAX when you could just go to the courtroom?
1414120	1419040	Then there's parents who will like go to death row and visit the killer and like petition
1419040	1422480	to have the killer not on death row, because they'll be like, look, I'm a Christian.
1422480	1423480	That's a courtroom.
1423480	1426640	You have to petition in a courtroom.
1426640	1428040	That is a good aspect of Christianity.
1428040	1432280	No, there's also some people who will go and visit with the killer of their loved one in
1432280	1434920	prison while they're there to talk with them.
1434920	1438800	They don't say I'm going to see the killer of my loved one.
1438800	1442000	You make it sound like it's a romance novel.
1442000	1445600	I didn't think I was mentioning any words.
1445600	1446600	You weren't mentioning words.
1446600	1447600	Here's my point.
1447600	1451360	There's a lot of different ways to deal with your kid getting killed.
1451360	1452360	OK.
1452360	1453360	Right.
1453360	1454840	Here's the one thing that everyone agrees on.
1454840	1455840	The what pill?
1455840	1456840	What?
1456840	1457840	You say ginseng?
1457840	1459840	The ginseng pill?
1459840	1461320	Yeah, what's the pill?
1461320	1464800	Here's the one thing that everyone agrees on.
1465320	1470960	They all say when they're at the they go, you know, the one thing you're not supposed
1470960	1475120	to do is bury your kid.
1475120	1476120	Everyone agrees on that.
1476120	1480760	OK, so can we just hack that a little bit, like just be like, I mean, you don't want
1480760	1488440	your kid to die, but if your kid does die in a strictly Darwinian sense, aren't you
1488440	1489440	killing it?
1489440	1493280	Like, like, aren't you like, like, like, should like one person just like be at the funeral
1493280	1497840	and be like, hey, check it out, burying my kid over here.
1497840	1503360	I'm fucking winning like I like I'm I'm I'm I'm so good at life.
1503360	1509200	I'm fucking shooting dead things out of me like I'm I'm a I'm a I'm a fucking God over
1509200	1510200	here.
1510200	1511200	What?
1511200	1512200	No.
1512200	1514200	Why is the guy excited now?
1514200	1518040	Because he's excited for the one reason no one's ever excited.
1518040	1520040	I'm just saying like he's burying his kids.
1520040	1521040	He's burying his kids.
1521040	1522040	That makes you.
1522040	1523040	It makes you look super guilty.
1523040	1524040	Right.
1524040	1525040	But that makes your generation.
1525040	1529800	You you failed because you were supposed to make that person live to like give birth.
1529800	1531680	And so you couldn't do that.
1531680	1532680	Right.
1532680	1533680	Isn't that like worse?
1533680	1534680	Well, yeah.
1534680	1536280	But do you think frogs feel that way?
1536280	1537280	Frogs don't feel that way.
1537280	1539280	Is this what playing Dungeons and Dragons is like?
1539280	1542760	We're getting close.
1542760	1544560	We're kind of skimming the edge.
1544560	1548520	I didn't say it would be a I didn't say it would be a popular new.
1548520	1549520	No.
1549520	1550520	No.
1550520	1551520	I raised that we should all run out and do.
1551520	1556680	I'm just kind of saying like if you you know there are people like MIT people that invent
1556680	1561560	like robot bugs and stuff and they they go you know what I like to do is I like to notice
1561560	1565720	what everyone's assuming and then disrupt that assumption like you never know a lot
1565720	1567080	of those things shouldn't be disrupted.
1567080	1573920	I think we found one not not not catching on the idea of bragging about outliving your
1573920	1574920	children.
1574920	1575920	It's an untapped market.
1575920	1584880	So also what is the use what is the application of of saying about outliving your children?
1584880	1585880	How does that help you?
1585880	1587880	I totally forgot what I was saying.
1587880	1589160	I just think it happened to me.
1589160	1590720	I'm on Prozac.
1590720	1593400	I'm on Adderall during the day.
1593400	1595600	I'm on Prozac at night.
1595600	1599800	But recently it may have to do with the vapor vapor.
1599800	1600800	Oh yeah.
1600800	1601800	Oh yeah.
1601800	1604400	I think you're going to say recently I just I just woke up on a pile of Skittles.
1604400	1605800	I don't know what's going to happen.
1606800	1609920	So does anybody and now I paid someone 50 bucks.
1609920	1615440	Does anybody remember what I just said because I don't remember.
1615440	1618520	To answer the question like what would be the application.
1618520	1621400	Imagine that you're a 60 year old woman.
1621400	1623800	I can imagine it as a man.
1623800	1630320	First of all that's his that's his backwards way of telling people how old I am.
1630320	1632600	Look I know how this guy works.
1632600	1634800	I've seen these kind of guys.
1634800	1636440	He shocks my whole life.
1636440	1639960	Now Andy if you were let's say you were a 60 year old woman.
1639960	1642200	What the fuck are you saying to me.
1642200	1643400	I'm a 60 year old man.
1643400	1644400	Now here's the thing.
1644400	1647680	Not only that I wish I was 60.
1647680	1651960	Not only that you're making this like I know what you're doing here.
1651960	1656560	Five years from now this is as an older person I won't be able to handle this.
1656560	1658360	I'll put this down here.
1658360	1659360	I'll go forward.
1659560	1664520	I don't know if I could I don't know that I could use that you couldn't remember what
1664520	1665520	I was saying.
1665520	1666520	All right.
1666520	1667520	You had to pay.
1667520	1669520	It wasn't how important could it have been.
1669520	1670520	It was.
1670520	1672440	I've been with you every step of the way.
1672440	1674400	But you wouldn't be able to remember it right.
1674400	1675400	Not tomorrow.
1675400	1676400	I know.
1676400	1679600	Well I mean now I mean I play back.
1679600	1680600	What do you think.
1680600	1681600	What did I say.
1681600	1682600	God bless.
1682600	1689600	Was this his spirituality based.
1689600	1692400	I think it was about killing people.
1692400	1698800	I'm saying that you wanted to know what would be the practical application of of outliving
1698800	1700440	your kids as like a brag.
1700440	1701840	But I had a joke.
1701840	1703560	I had a joke about it.
1703560	1705240	And now I can't remember the joke.
1705240	1706240	So they can't pop.
1706240	1709560	It can't be any possible point I could make with that set up.
1709560	1710560	Well it's my.
1710560	1711560	I want to answer the question.
1711560	1712880	You have to be a joke.
1712880	1715200	Like imagine being a 60 year old woman I'm saying.
1715200	1722360	Will you stop pointing out to the fact that I am indeed the same age range as the character
1722360	1724960	you're talking about.
1724960	1728080	Except my cis gender is male.
1728080	1730760	I don't know what I'm saying.
1730760	1735160	And I am a 60 year old man and I'm down at the other end of the honky tonk.
1735160	1739920	And like then you get handed a drink and the bartender says that's on the gentleman down
1739920	1740920	there.
1740920	1746920	And he wants you to know he's so virile that he outlives his children.
1746920	1752360	I would say you know I'd say oh what a jokester let's you know what I'm saying.
1752360	1757800	You look down and I'm like raise my cowboy hat and then we and then it's good for one
1757800	1761480	line dance and I get to know you over a shimmy Timmy.
1761480	1763960	I remember the line Andy.
1763960	1764960	I remember the line.
1765000	1774440	What I meant to say was if you the fact that you go outliving your kid is the worst thing.
1774440	1776680	So that's not great to do it.
1776680	1781400	When someone dies you say to them hey at least you're not one of those outliving your kid
1781400	1782400	situations.
1782400	1783400	Right.
1783400	1786400	Just your wife.
1786400	1790240	Okay you go someone's wife dies right.
1790240	1794520	So sorry you hear about Esther would be a Jew woman.
1794520	1796640	So sorry you hear that Esther passed away.
1796640	1797640	At least you're not.
1797640	1798640	Oh yeah.

1799640	1800640	Am I right.
1800640	1801640	Yeah.
1801640	1802640	That's the worst.
1802640	1803640	Look at the bright side.
1803640	1804640	Yeah.
1804640	1808360	Yeah she didn't Esther like the true crime shows and didn't they always say on those
1808360	1810760	shows you should never outlive your kids.

1811760	1812760	So you know why.
1812760	1813760	No more nagging.

1923360	1926360	You got to jump all over.
1926360	1930360	I'm trying to ease to jump.
1930560	1936560	Get off the ground with both feet at the same time if you can.
1938560	1939960	You've avoided catchy.
1939960	1942360	You've avoided catchy the whole time.
1942360	1943560	You know what I'm saying.
1943560	1945960	So far nothing's been catchy.
1945960	1948360	We you are going to get sued.
1948360	1949360	No.
1949360	1950760	You're going to get sued by Van Halen.
1950760	1951760	Yeah.
1951760	1952760	He even mentioned.
1952760	1955360	We got to go again.
1955360	1957760	You got to get that show.
1957760	1958760	No that's Panama.
1959760	1960760	But isn't it.
1960760	1961760	You know what.
1961760	1965760	It's Van Halen's fault that I know that I can't remember any part of jump.
1965760	1969760	You just go fair use fair use fair use.
1970760	1971760	That was weak.
1971760	1973760	I'm very sorry about it.
1973760	1974760	Yeah.
1974760	1976760	That was pretty that that was pretty close to it.
1976760	1978760	You might want to change a couple more things about.
1978760	1979760	Yeah.
1979760	1981760	I might as well jump.
1981760	1984760	That's how I that's how I hear that advice.
1984760	1987760	Why aren't you jumping so much.
1987760	1994760	I turn everything into a Jewish song that make a million dollars one day with my Jewish versions of pop songs.
1994760	1997760	Here's journeys any way you want it.
1997760	1998760	Oh all right.
2003760	2006760	Sounds kind of similar to the last song.
2006760	2015760	Anyway you want it.
2015760	2017760	That's the way you get it.
2017760	2019760	Anywhere you want it.
2019760	2022760	Anywhere you want it.
2022760	2026760	You're gonna get it just the way you want it.
2026760	2028760	More more monotone.
2028760	2038760	If you want it you're gonna get it in the way you're gonna receive it is the way that you want it because that's how I give it.
2041760	2045760	Hey I heard you wanted something.
2045760	2048760	Maybe I could be of service.
2048760	2049760	Hey.
2049760	2052760	How badly do you want it.
2052760	2053760	Hey.
2053760	2055760	I'm gonna give it to you.
2055760	2060760	But the way in which I give it to you is of most note.
2060760	2062760	Most most no.
2062760	2069760	Is the way I'm going to give it to you is the way you chose.
2069760	2071760	Talking about any way you want it.
2071760	2073760	That's the way you get it.
2073760	2075760	Anyway you want it.
2075760	2078760	Don't get too close now.
2078760	2080760	I think that's the police.
2080760	2082760	Anyway you want it.
2082760	2084760	Okay.
2084760	2086760	That's racist dude.
2086760	2089760	Not all.
2089760	2091760	If you want it delivered.
2091760	2095760	If you want to pick take out.
2095760	2097760	Anyway you want it.
2097760	2098760	No pickles.
2098760	2099760	Onion.
2099760	2101760	No problem.
2101760	2104760	I'm always thinking about something commercial.
2104760	2105760	Cash in.
2105760	2106760	Cash in.
2106760	2108760	That's what I've said to you many times.
2108760	2109760	Harmon.
2109760	2111760	I'm gonna start calling you Harmon.
2111760	2113760	How's it going on.
2113760	2114760	I left Twitter.
2114760	2115760	How's it going on Twitter.
2115760	2117760	Well I don't make eye contact anymore.
2117760	2118760	That's my new thing.
2118760	2120760	Ever since I've been on Twitter.
2120760	2123760	I'm afraid I'll see someone from Twitter.
2123760	2124760	Hey.
2124760	2128760	I'm razor blade and apple Andy.
2128760	2131760	You blocked me seven years ago.
2131760	2135760	After I said I was gonna come over and stab you.
2135760	2137760	Why did you do that?
2137760	2139760	You knew it was a joke right.
2139760	2140760	Right.
2140760	2142760	Oh no I didn't know stab, stab, stab.
2142760	2143760	The end of the story.
2143760	2145760	That's why it's gonna go one day.
2145760	2146760	That's the way it's gonna go.
2146760	2148760	I've decided that I don't even care.
2148760	2150760	You know I'm not gonna shake my cane at anybody.
2150760	2151760	I got what I wanted.
2151760	2152760	I don't care.
2152760	2158760	But like I just I just I don't I scratch my the front lawn of my head with a tiny cane
2158760	2161760	that I'm technically shaking because I'm scratching my head with it.
2161760	2165760	It's a little it's a splitting the difference when you're shaking my cane at the youth
2165760	2169760	and I just like also just being acquiesced and I'm like shaking a cane to scratch my
2169760	2170760	head.
2170760	2171760	A tiny cane.
2171760	2173760	Or a cocktail umbrella something like that.
2173760	2181760	Like why don't why how is blocking you me doing something to you.
2181760	2186760	Like when in real life that's all you can ever fucking do to somebody that you don't
2186760	2192760	like and still be civil is like stop not talk to them and right want to hear their bullshit
2192760	2193760	and walk away.
2193760	2197760	Like how does that not apply to the fucking Internet where everyone is hanging out together
2197760	2200760	like and you and you go and then they go I got blocked.
2200760	2203760	I got blocked by Harrison Ford.
2203760	2205760	He blocked me for what.
2205760	2206760	What did you say.
2206760	2208760	Oh I said I could shoot back.
2208760	2209760	It sucks your dick.
2209760	2211760	And they he blocked me.
2211760	2213760	You can't block me like lately.
2213760	2218760	I say the reaction to getting blocked is like is like is like someone's stun baton you like
2218760	2222760	like like Harrison Ford told like like like tased you by why he didn't.
2222760	2223760	He blocked you.
2223760	2226760	He did exactly what Harrison Ford was supposed to do.
2226760	2229760	Like Harrison Ford landed a plane in an airport type of thing.
2229760	2230760	Yeah.
2230760	2231760	He figured.
2231760	2232760	Yeah.
2232760	2233760	I'm sorry.
2233760	2234760	He's had nine accidents.
2234760	2236760	Is he going to jail.
2236760	2237760	That's all I care about.
2237760	2239760	Is he going to jail.
2239760	2241760	And is no specter still in jail.
2241760	2243760	That's all I care about.
2243760	2245760	And what's the deal with Robert Blake.
2245760	2246760	Is he out.
2246760	2247760	Out.
2247760	2248760	In.
2248760	2249760	Out.
2249760	2250760	In.
2250760	2251760	Out.
2251760	2252760	In.
2252760	2253760	In.
2253760	2254760	Vitellos.

2281760	2285760	Why is he watching so much.
2285760	2286760	I should be.
2286760	2287760	I should be concerned.
2287760	2288760	It's like.
2288760	2289760	How could I pour.
2289760	2290760	Yeah.
2290760	2292760	Best way to poison random people near you.
2292760	2293760	Stuff like that.
2293760	2294760	So.
2294760	2295760	Investigation Discovery.
2295760	2296760	Most of the shows are very very good.
2296760	2298760	But then some of the shows.
2298760	2301760	Are on these other things like the reels is really like cheesy.
2301760	2303760	Or people.
2303760	2304760	So how do you.
2304760	2305760	I think the Vanity Fair is pretty good.
2305760	2307760	Vanity Fair Confidential is pretty good.
2307760	2308760	Yeah.
2308760	2310760	Was that long winded for nothing.
2310760	2311760	Well.
2311760	2314760	Just a little sample of my act.
2314760	2316760	Can can can can you.
2316760	2319760	Like I don't I don't get a lot of response from these folks about this.
2319760	2323760	But I think people think I'm the weirdo for mounting this campaign.
2323760	2324760	Why.
2324760	2327760	Why do we accept.
2327760	2330760	It forensically the word panties.
2330760	2332760	Like why.
2332760	2336760	Why is it that when women's or especially little girls underwear are
2336760	2339760	found at crime scenes we have to call them panties.
2339760	2341760	Well how is that scientific.
2341760	2343760	Like like their underwear.
2343760	2345760	Like like you know it's just like why.
2345760	2346760	Why do we.
2346760	2349760	What do you have to switch to that word.
2349760	2350760	Dr.
2350760	2351760	Henry Lee.
2351760	2352760	I love him.
2352760	2355760	But he says panties in that thick like forensic accent.
2355760	2356760	He's like.
2356760	2358760	Oh see mistake on Panty.
2358760	2360760	And it's like stop saying panties.
2360760	2361760	Stop it.
2361760	2362760	Did he do singular though.
2362760	2363760	Because you just.
2363760	2364760	Yeah he does.

2367760	2369760	As you see there's blood on her pant.
2369760	2370760	I was going to do it.
2370760	2374760	Do a joke about how I like to wear the panties and I realized.
2374760	2375760	Don't go.
2375760	2376760	Don't do that.
2376760	2377760	Yeah.
2377760	2378760	I mean it shouldn't be a joke.
2378760	2379760	You should be supported for that.

2429760	2430760	This is the most embarrassing story.
2430760	2431760	But it really shouldn't be embarrassing.
2431760	2432760	This was a.
2432760	2437760	A part where a guy on CSI Miami maybe.
2437760	2438760	Something.
2438760	2441760	He likes to collect used women's panties.
2441760	2443760	This is the part I was going out for.

2454760	2456760	Jeff Davis says that a lot.
2456760	2459760	Don't keep that light under a bushel.
2459760	2461760	I love that expression.
2461760	2462760	So.
2462760	2463760	I hated.
2463760	2467760	I hated the guy who would want to collect women's panties.
2467760	2468760	I hated.
2468760	2470760	It's not like oh you have to fall in love with the guy to play it.
2470760	2472760	So this is an actual true story.
2472760	2473760	The audition before me.
2473760	2475760	I hear for a different part.
2475760	2479760	I hear as if the guy has broken the wall.
2479760	2480760	He's a.
2480760	2483760	And I actually texted my my agent.

2506760	2507760	Okay.
2507760	2508760	Different characters.
2508760	2509760	Different care.
2509760	2510760	I was at the end.
2510760	2511760	The beginning of the creepy people.
2511760	2512760	Really.
2512760	2513760	Yeah.
2513760	2515760	You're you're you're in the finals because like the you know you're not in
2515760	2517760	like a cattle call for the pedophile.

2518760	2521760	You're like you're like the pedophile they're seeing next after they see the
2521760	2522760	cop.

2523760	2524760	Right.

2529760	2531760	he's so fucking lazy.
2531760	2533760	Your guy is so lazy.
2533760	2535760	And they look at me.
2535760	2536760	They look at me.
2536760	2538760	After it.
2538760	2541760	Like with a disgusted look.
2541760	2543760	I swear to God.
2543760	2545760	I didn't fucking write this.
2545760	2546760	You wrote.
2546760	2547760	You wrote this.
2547760	2550760	You wrote the sick character and you're looking at me.
2550760	2553760	Oh this guy's a little weird.
2553760	2557760	Seems to seems a little too comfortable with his.
2557760	2560760	Liking to collect woman's panties.
2560760	2564760	That's how I'd never get that part right because I would be so afraid to nail
2564760	2565760	it.
2565760	2566760	That's what I was.
2566760	2567760	I wouldn't relax.
2567760	2570760	I'd be like give me some of those panties.
2570760	2573760	Why don't you stop putting so much cinnamon on it.
2573760	2574760	Well what do you want me to say.
2574760	2578760	Let me see those panties and they'd be like oh you're hired.
2578760	2583760	Oh you're hired.
2583760	2586760	And then the next day if I can vice headline would be like too close to the
2586760	2587760	bone.
2587760	2592760	Harmon knocks it out of the pedo park with his performance on CSI.
2592760	2593760	London.
2593760	2595760	You never want to see that headline.
2595760	2597760	You never want to see the line again.
2597760	2599760	I like those panties and stuff.
2599760	2600760	Wow.

2601760	2602760	I mean I like them panties.
2602760	2603760	I like those panties.
2603760	2609760	I didn't kill Schminple.
2609760	2613760	It's like the inverse red shirt guy in the sex crime episode.
2613760	2617760	There's always the guy they catch first who like lives in a boiler room and has a shoebox
2617760	2619760	full of like socks.
2619760	2621760	And so the public is like well boo.
2621760	2625760	And then he always turns out to not be the actual killer.
2625760	2627760	The actual killer is like ripped from the headlines.
2627760	2628760	It's like a congressman or something.
2628760	2629760	He's the lead.
2629760	2630760	He's the mislead.
2630760	2631760	Yeah.
2631760	2632760	The red herring.
2632760	2636760	I'm starting to pick that up when I watch a million hours of the I can't watch
2636760	2638760	politics anymore because I hate Trump so much.
2638760	2641760	So I just watch hours and hours and hours of these case files.
2641760	2642760	That's what I do too.
2642760	2643760	What do you think it is?
2643760	2645760	What is it about true crime?
2645760	2650760	Well I have OCD and I'm please please withhold your sympathy.

2660760	2662760	I have severe.
2662760	2665760	Well I can't get anyone to be upset about my OCD.
2665760	2666760	It's like oh yeah.
2666760	2669760	I think it's like a schtick that Jewish comics do.
2669760	2670760	They don't even know.
2671760	2674760	It's like when you say oh I can't smoke weed I get paranoid.
2674760	2675760	Like they don't even.
2675760	2676760	They're like what do you mean.
2676760	2677760	Like you think aliens are after you.
2677760	2679760	You'll find out what paranoid everybody.
2679760	2683760	Everybody will have to ruin weed for an entire generation.
2683760	2684760	Good.
2684760	2685760	They're still not going to listen.
2685760	2686760	I didn't.
2686760	2689760	I'm just saying like it sounds like gibberish some of the stuff that you say.
2689760	2690760	When you're past 40.
2690760	2691760	Like I can't think of other stuff.
2691760	2692760	Hot diggity.

2698760	2699760	Yeah.
2699760	2702760	And now I looked it up and you know what it means.
2702760	2703760	Nope.
2703760	2706760	It's how it's exactly why my parents left.
2706760	2709760	My grandparents left Eastern Europe.
2709760	2712760	It means get out while the getting is good.
2712760	2713760	Oh really.
2713760	2716760	They were leaving the Nazis read a goddamn book.
2716760	2717760	I'm a Jew.

2720760	2721760	Is that is it.
2721760	2723760	That's what I thought.
2723760	2724760	That's what I thought.
2724760	2726760	But it was more like a routine thing.
2726760	2728760	It was like it's like two threes could do.
2728760	2729760	Like one two three.
2729760	2731760	And the crowd's not that hot.
2731760	2736760	Do like is it 20 23 seconds into your act if you haven't gotten a laugh.

2742760	2747760	I always thought it was I always did think it was 1923 skidoo because I'm very I'm
2747760	2748760	simple minded.
2748760	2750760	But not exactly.
2750760	2754760	I wouldn't call myself bright.
2755760	2758760	We hit that face.
2758760	2760760	Hey who wants to play a parlor game.

2786760	2790760	I started watching that game night movie because I heard multiple times.
2790760	2791760	Oh it's pretty good.
2791760	2793760	Like like like that kind of surprised Lilt.
2793760	2795760	That's pretty good.
2795760	2796760	And I was like all right.
2796760	2800760	I'll watch a pretty good thing because it sounds like there's some reason why it
2800760	2802760	shouldn't be good which intrigues me.
2802760	2805760	Otherwise I don't watch like comedies and stuff but I shut it off.
2805760	2806760	I apologize.
2806760	2807760	I'm sorry.
2807760	2808760	You're in the audience.
2808760	2809760	You wrote the movie.
2809760	2810760	You directed it whatever.
2810760	2811760	Thanks a lot.
2811760	2812760	I just I.
2812760	2813760	Oh my.
2813760	2814760	Where's my car.
2814760	2817760	It seemed to have like a Miller Lite commercial tone to it.
2817760	2821760	Like it just felt like people were kind of over the over the tippy.
2821760	2823760	I like my comedy grounded.
2823760	2830760	Hey I just realized after how long I've been out here that I could put the drink
2830760	2835760	over here and they say they say I don't have they say I'm not don't have an
2835760	2837760	Einstein vibe.
2837760	2842760	Hey Einstein came up with the theory of relativity but he was unable to come up
2842760	2844760	with the unified field theory.
2844760	2846760	Nice going Einstein.
2853760	2854760	OK.
2854760	2862760	The next song in my workout is Bex dreams Bex dreams Steve.
2862760	2863760	What's my work.
2863760	2867760	We tried that is this part of the sketch.
2867760	2869760	Is this part of the sketch.
2880760	2881760	Using airplay.
2881760	2882760	You may notice a delay.
2882760	2883760	OK.
2883760	2884760	Let's.
2887760	2889760	Sounds like it is real.

2897760	2899760	So you recognize this is Bex dreams.
2902760	2903760	Dreams.
2907760	2908760	Yeah.
2908760	2909760	I don't know.
2909760	2912760	It's one that doesn't sound very much like dreams.
2912760	2916760	Well I think it just kind of the speakers like don't really.
2918760	2919760	Not a fan of it.
2920760	2922760	Could I could I just try it without the.
2924760	2925760	Airplay.
2926760	2928760	I don't want to get anybody fired but.
2929760	2932760	Turn that part turn that part back on everyone fired.
2934760	2935760	Yeah.
2935760	2937760	Oh we didn't hear those drums at all.
2938760	2941760	So a tiny little drummer in a box maybe it was like mono.
2942760	2943760	Yeah.
2943760	2944760	See that.
2944760	2945760	Now you recognize it.
2945760	2946760	It's back.
2946760	2947760	Yeah.
2947760	2949760	This is clearly just the song.
2950760	2951760	Come on.
2951760	2953760	I love your dreams.
2954760	2957760	Dreaming all the night for me.

2962760	2963760	Come on baby.
2963760	2965760	Living my dreams.
2966760	2969760	Well I've got a special bed for you.
2970760	2974760	But you don't need one because you're in a dream.
2974760	2977760	It's really a bed for me.
2978760	2981760	So I can be with you in my dreams.
2981760	2983760	It's a special bed.
2983760	2984760	Boom boom.
2984760	2985760	Yes.
2985760	2987760	Very inspirational.
2987760	2989760	Special bed.
2989760	2991760	To help me dream.
2991760	2992760	Theremin sound.
2993760	2994760	Theremin sound.
2995760	2996760	Theremin sound.
2998760	3003760	Well you know it's it's it's it's more original music than you usually get in an episode.
3004760	3005760	I don't know.
3005760	3007760	You do a lot of the rippity raps you pretty much.
3007760	3008760	Plus you know Zach.
3008760	3010760	Zach drops out you know.
3010760	3011760	Yeah.
3011760	3012760	Zach provides us with beats.
3012760	3016760	You know rap it's from the streets and that's cool.
3017760	3021760	But sometimes I need to get up there and stretch my wings and be a real musician.
3021760	3022760	Have you tried.
3022760	3026760	I've been working on the railroad type things where you you don't have to pay for the rights.
3026760	3027760	And then you just.
3027760	3030760	I've been working on the railroad.
3030760	3032760	I've been working on the railroad.
3032760	3034760	All the live long day.
3034760	3035760	Spice love.
3035760	3038760	I've been working on the railroad.
3038760	3041760	Just to pass the time away.
3041760	3043760	Kimler mashup.
3043760	3046760	Can't you hear the whistle blowing.
3047760	3050760	Dinah blow your horn.
3050760	3052760	Dinah get get a room.
3052760	3053760	Dinah won't you blow.
3053760	3055760	Dinah won't you blow.
3055760	3057760	Dinah won't you blow.
3057760	3058760	No blow your.
3058860	3060760	Dinah blow your.
3060760	3062760	Because every song back of those days.
3062760	3063760	Bop bop bop.
3063760	3065760	Kimler mashup.
3065760	3067760	Mashup mashup.
3070760	3071760	Yeah I like.
3071760	3072760	Thank you.
3072760	3073760	I like that.
3073760	3075760	And then I wrote.
3075760	3078760	High quality crowd on the fence like that.
3078760	3079760	Stuck.
3079760	3081760	This old man.
3081760	3083760	He played one.
3083760	3088900	He played knick-knack on my drum, everybody.
3088900	3091900	Oh, no.
3091900	3099920	Andy, what do you think is the first, like, aside from the stuff that's already happened,
3099920	3105500	what do you think is going to be the, what's the big sign you're waiting for dreading that
3105500	3111580	really for real, the worst parts of you are right about everything, this is it, the country
3111580	3117620	is sliding into a fascist nightmare, what's the real fucking, like, Rubicon that you're
3117620	3118620	creating?
3118620	3123860	I would say if he says tomorrow will be Kristallnacht.
3123860	3126300	He just out and says it.
3126300	3127620	That's how stupid he is.
3127620	3128620	Right.
3128620	3131740	And then I'll say later, it's the name of a dress.
3131740	3133980	No collusion with Kristallnacht.
3133980	3137620	I did not tell people to break the windows, there's no proof of that.
3137620	3143780	The fake news needs to jump all over my use of the word Kristallnacht to try to take away
3143780	3147620	from their disastrous ratings watching each other.
3147620	3149860	What a bunch of losers.
3149860	3153060	I will get the Jews to pay for the camps.
3153060	3159060	That's from my, that's from my act, that's from my act, I apologize.
3159060	3160780	That's prepared material.
3160780	3167260	You people are, I'm better than that, I'm better than that prepared material.
3167260	3173340	I'm worried now, and I actually think, but I like dream about Mueller every night.
3173340	3179660	I just love Mueller, and it's like, I just think Mueller's going to save the day.
3179660	3184460	I have predicted for a long time, I've been wrong so often that people don't even return
3184460	3186660	my calls anymore.
3186660	3192020	I think by the end of summer he's going to be out of office because he will resign.
3192020	3196780	My nightmare is that Mueller, the panel will release its findings.
3196780	3204140	There will obviously be a criminal finding of some kind.
3204140	3210300	By old definitions, by Nixonian definitions, there will be massive malfeasance tantamount
3210300	3216060	possibly even to international criminology.
3216060	3221500	Certainly money laundering, dirty money, terrible things, but my fear is that that's just going
3221500	3227060	to kick off the, where the nation's now been divided down the middle and on one side, you
3227060	3231860	kind of, it used to be like they were a freak fringe where the people are like, Sandy Hook,
3231860	3234980	well, okay, don't try to get me in a corner.
3234980	3239680	It's probably fake, and it's like they shook the hands with the devil at that point, but
3239680	3245220	we always thought that was like 5% into the country, and now it's like, oh, what if you
3245220	3250780	slice this loaf of bread right down the middle, and it was like half and half, and it seems
3250780	3254920	like half of the country is like going to go, Mueller's going to go.
3254920	3259940	So as you can see from these photos of him stealing money out of a safe with Abe Lincoln's
3259940	3269620	head on it and handing it to a man, a Russian man dressed like snidely whiplash and exchanging
3269620	3284620	like hand jobs with him and then coming on to an 11-year-old couch to rot steward.
3284620	3287860	And everyone's just going to go, fake news and.
3287860	3292140	There's a chance that's going to happen, but what I think is going to happen is I believe
3292140	3295600	every single thing that they have said about him is true.
3295600	3300920	Like absolutely, he had whatever that thing with the P-tapes are, it happened because
3300920	3305920	his bodyguard has already said, oh, they invited, they said we're going to send women up there.
3305920	3309480	But what part of that have we gotten the impression would actually flip anybody?
3309480	3314360	No, because if you see, I'm saying if they're on the same day, here's the P-tape.
3314360	3317200	Here's the guy who got all his money from the Russians.
3317200	3319720	Here's when he paid for 12 abortions.
3319720	3324640	Here's what, I mean, it's like I think the stuff we know about him is the good stuff.
3324640	3325640	You know what I'm saying?
3325640	3328560	That was supposed to be like a joke, like he's so terrible.
3328560	3334560	And you think it is possible that there will just be such a mountain of, that it's still
3334560	3337600	a matter of scale, that we have across this tipping point.
3337600	3341240	I feel like I'm through the looking glass where it doesn't, nothing matters.
3341240	3342240	You might be right.
3342240	3344480	And I'm like I say, look at my track record, horrible.
3344480	3349520	Yeah, I didn't think he was going to win, but anyways, yeah, I was just curious.
3349520	3350520	But you know what?
3350520	3355680	With Trump, I've been pleasantly surprised.
3355680	3356680	What is yours, Dan?
3356680	3357680	Do you have one?
3357680	3361000	Do I have a moment that I'm dreading?
3361000	3362000	Yeah.
3362000	3367920	Yeah, I'm dreading anything that has anything to do with me being accountable.
3367920	3371840	Anything where it's like, where I have to be that guy in the beginning of Inglorious
3371840	3377800	Bastards who has to choose between looking down at the floorboards and not.
3377800	3386280	I have to serve tea to a dude in a fucking ice vest who is there for someone that's done
3386280	3393240	great work on my palm trees or something.
3393240	3400480	Who came to me in tears and was like, we don't speak a lot, but I'm fucking, I'm terrified.
3400480	3404040	And I was like, well, just fucking, of course, hang out.
3404040	3407360	I'll build a fake wall, I'll put some Rick and Morty art on it.
3407600	3410600	Are you saying you would have put up the you would have put up the pranks?
3410600	3417720	Well, I'm assuming that I got into a situation at this point where I had to choose between
3417720	3421760	saying yes or no to human life and would probably just whether or not I'm a good person that
3421760	3426160	I would just that I tend to get into situations or I'd be like, yeah, I don't want to be a
3426160	3427160	piece of shit.
3427160	3430080	And then like, and then, yeah, I'm worried about being tested.
3430080	3435160	I'm worried about I'm worried about like seeing shit out my window or the doorbell ringing
3435160	3441160	and like like the rubber meeting any kind of road, the road being my place where my
3441160	3442160	spine should be.
3442160	3451160	Well, I think you have to have a you absolutely have to have a one of the bookcase that swivels
3451160	3453280	have to have that.
3453280	3457000	And I'm trying to write this joke all day today.
3457000	3465720	I got I thought she said get us safe room, but you got to say it said safe word.
3465720	3474280	Now I'm out twenty thousand dollars, but it puts it you have to imagine me as a worm being
3474280	3475280	into panties.
3475280	3476280	Yeah.
3476280	3477280	Yeah.
3477280	3480280	Because I like the panty show.
3480280	3481280	Sure.
3481280	3482280	Hey, Spencer.
3482280	3483280	Do you have?
3483280	3484280	Hey, who does?
3484400	3487600	Who doesn't this lady knows what I'm talking about?
3487600	3490400	Hey, there are used women panties.
3490400	3491400	What's not to like?
3491400	3495320	Spencer, do you have a moment of panic?
3495320	3496320	What?
3496320	3497320	Oh, yeah.
3497320	3501240	The Mueller verdict is going to come back and then like they're going to be like, if
3501240	3505800	you support the president, don't enforce the law and then they won't.
3505800	3507520	And that'll be the Reichstag moment.
3507520	3511880	And then that'll be the moment at which, you know, effectively civil war has begun or,
3511880	3515440	you know, suppression officials sanction, oppression will start.
3515440	3519440	And then, yeah, I don't know that that's going to happen, but I feel like that's going to
3519440	3524440	be the real turning point because they're not going to say, oh, no, nothing happens.
3524440	3526680	I'm so terrified of that happening.
3526680	3529960	There's a part of my brain that wants the Mueller to find nothing.
3529960	3534240	That's how much of a coward have become like I just I just don't because I don't even want
3534240	3536240	to fucking dance anymore.
3536240	3539320	I want to tell you what you got to do, folks.
3539320	3540320	I don't want it.
3540320	3542320	I don't want to depress you, people.
3542320	3552480	Maybe we'll maybe we'll make it out of this where insane madman who, as I've said, Trump
3552480	3558920	is like if Hitler couldn't find Poland on a map, right?
3558920	3561240	I have with me and I have enough for Dan.
3561240	3562240	Is that cyanide?
3562240	3563240	Cyanide.
3563240	3568680	Andy, you got to get some of them are mints and to get off the deep web.
3568680	3575240	I keep telling you, Andy Kindler will not stay on the deep web.
3575240	3577560	This guy is a deep web addict.
3577560	3579600	That's Jew, Russian, Roulette, right?
3579600	3586880	One of these one of these lozenges can take cyanide.
3586880	3590480	That's just that's just meant to lay them.
3590480	3591480	I'm sorry.
3591480	3594600	I'm sorry about the overly Jewish thing because I can tell.
3594600	3597080	I know I was a little nervous there.
3597880	3599880	I'm Polish mostly.
3599880	3600880	Oh.
3600880	3603560	So same same Z's really, right?
3603560	3608720	So you are covered in eraser sized like tags that fall off over time.
3608720	3612880	Hey, I just want to say whoever said this was going to be good led me down the wrong
3612880	3613880	way.
3613880	3619920	Yeah, it's all I'm already it's already but hey, there seems to be no free lunch with
3619920	3620920	the sugar.
3620920	3621920	You know what I'm saying?
3622120	3623120	What do people say?
3623120	3631600	Oh, I have a sprig of avocado in my water and oh, I have a soda dispenser.
3633600	3635200	You're fooling yourself.
3635200	3636720	Yeah, it doesn't or you're not.
3636720	3638560	Like, yeah, it's about lying.
3638560	3641640	They're lying to other people and they're not fooling them.
3641640	3644520	So some friends of mine say they had that sort of machine.
3644520	3645200	They love it.
3645200	3651120	And I started drinking these La Croix and I got in the habit of it.
3651120	3653560	Like, and now that's what's in my fridge.
3653560	3655160	It's what's better than water.
3655160	3657880	But it's not my fridge isn't full of Diet Coke anymore.
3657880	3660400	And it's right for formed a new habit.
3660400	3663160	Diet Coke is definitely I'm glad you dropped that one.
3663160	3666680	It's kind of it's kind of like it's like you retrain your brain to consider other
3666680	3668480	dumb, dumber shit a treat.
3668480	3671280	Like, yeah, it does kind of work like it does.
3671280	3673240	It takes like two weeks or a month.
3673240	3674800	But it's like it's weird.
3674800	3676000	Like you feel better.
3676000	3677720	I mean, yeah, yeah.
3677720	3681880	Yeah, I mean, I feel better when I realize that I haven't had a Diet Coke in a long
3681880	3682400	time.
3682400	3685440	Yeah, I guess every time I go to I'm like, well, I'm just basically drinking like
3685440	3687160	whatever this is, fucking mermaid water.
3687160	3687600	What is that?
3687600	3689520	What is that shit?
3689520	3691000	Is it just it's just seltzer?
3691000	3692160	It sounds French.
3692160	3693360	Pama poos.
3693360	3694160	No, it's not.
3694160	3695000	It's lemon.
3695000	3698720	But then we said, you know, they say you start with the lemon ladle.
3698720	3701280	You want the papa moose.
3701280	3702640	It's never happened this conversation.
3702640	3704080	I'm making up a person.
3704080	3706440	We're just going to find out that that's bad for you anyway.
3706520	3708720	You might as well wait until we find out that's bad for you.
3708720	3709000	Oh, wait.
3709000	3710360	There's a prop 65 warning.
3712640	3716560	You have to you'd have to be you'd have to be 60 years old, I guess, to laugh at that
3716560	3718400	joke, which would be like, what is this?
3718400	3720360	Prop 13 something like that.
3720720	3722760	That is marijuana.
3723360	3724280	That's marijuana, right?
3724280	3724920	Prop 13.
3725280	3730000	The prop 13 was the thing that reduced property taxes because old people had to
3730000	3731880	pay a lot of money for this.
3732000	3733440	Would you pay this money for a thing?
3733640	3736480	I know I'm look, I peaked about a half hour ago.
3736720	3737760	Let's not care ourselves.
3738320	3739280	Let's not care ourselves.
3739640	3741640	I'm just trying to keep up.
3742920	3747480	No, it's hard to know when the show is failing because you wonder, like, if you
3747480	3751040	listen to any previous 300 episodes, you're like, why are they coming?
3752720	3754920	How do you know when you're doing a bad one?
3755760	3759720	I just never am like, all right, I'm almost done.
3760680	3765440	Well, I have, I finally have a podcast because people said, Andy, please.
3766160	3770160	30, 30 years in, try something.
3771320	3777040	Do you have, I said, do I have to do anything to make this move forward?
3777600	3778240	Anything.
3778240	3778640	Yes.
3778640	3779280	Anything.
3779720	3784760	So, uh, I've tried, I I've done 60 of which is me and my friend.
3784800	3787800	You have a, you have a podcast called it's called thought spiral.
3787880	3788960	I'm not plugging it.
3788960	3789720	Please plug it.
3789720	3790240	Where is it?
3790240	3791320	What network is it on?
3791880	3792920	Oh, network.
3793000	3796120	No, no, we're not so fast.
3796120	3798400	But you have to be on a network.
3798400	3798720	No.
3798720	3799040	Yeah.
3799120	3801920	If it's a bunch of cassette tapes, somebody's ripping you off.
3802560	3802800	Yeah.
3802800	3804920	We want to be the best known.
3805040	3808320	No one's getting the, we want no, nobody cutting into our nothing.
3808320	3810200	Do you use a Patreon?
3810200	3811840	That's the big, we haven't thought of that yet.
3812080	3816720	I keep saying as a running joke, this is how good my podcast is as a running joke.
3817000	3818440	I say paywall every week.
3819840	3821000	Is that funny or what?
3821720	3824520	It's just two Jews, but it's the hardest thing I've ever done.
3824680	3825040	Why?
3825040	3825560	Oh, yeah.
3825680	3827440	Because there's no, because there's no laughter.
3827440	3828600	Is it you're doing it in studio?
3828760	3830600	Well, sometimes it's the greatest thing.
3830640	3833720	Sometimes it's, but you know, I'm sure you relate every week.
3833720	3834760	You feel differently, right?
3834760	3835040	Yeah.
3835040	3835320	Yeah.
3835720	3839360	I mean, well, this room feels very different, but I find myself missing the intimacy,
3839360	3842200	the dryness of the sound at nerd melt.
3842400	3843920	I miss that place every day.
3843920	3848000	It's like, when you, when you listen back to the audio and when you're doing it,
3848320	3852320	like, this is like, unmistakably, there's a membrane between me and these people.
3852320	3856080	I can't look at them and I can't, I don't, there's something psychologically,
3856080	3857840	there's like a wall of jello.
3858680	3861200	This is harder to feel the connection.
3861360	3864080	I mean, I'm in serious love with many of these people.
3864720	3866840	You owe serious money to them?
3866840	3867480	Is there anybody?
3867480	3869120	No, I said, I'm serious love.
3869400	3871680	Is there anybody here who has a father?
3872000	3872280	All right.
3872280	3878240	Now, look, yeah, because there is that divide.
3878240	3880880	First, not only divide, there's like an area rug.
3881200	3883280	Yeah, there's, there's a whole area.
3883280	3884320	A Persian rug.
3884680	3886120	I don't know what anything about rug is.
3886120	3889360	I do feel like maybe a burlesque performer should come out and like,
3889400	3892360	like do a little seven veil dance and then.
3894600	3894800	Yeah.
3894800	3898000	So I know what you mean, but I, I, it is intimate though.
3898240	3898880	It is intimate.
3899240	3903920	Well, they're seated intimately, but I feel like we're talking into megaphones.
3904000	3910320	And I, I, I, that's what these people, if I ever talk to a megaphone to get you
3910320	3915680	people to get off your asses about climate, warm, warming, is it warming?
3916560	3922200	Like art theaters, like why, why was it so possible at meltdown to do, to not have
3922200	3927120	it like, like if we're in a theater, aren't theaters built to have no mics?
3927120	3930680	Like, like, shouldn't I be able to do like a little, a little play up here?
3930760	3935040	I mean, yeah, it was projection, lower ceiling, a little hotter.
3935200	3936160	It was a little more raw.
3936320	3937440	So it felt more intimate.
3937480	3937760	Right.
3937920	3943520	The problem with theaters, I found, just from my experience is people expect the
3943520	3950560	show and then they come see me and I'm whinging, I'm whining, I'm sweating.
3951280	3952000	I'm complaining.
3952000	3953520	I'm asking how much time is left.
3953840	3955160	And that's not what happens.
3956080	3960600	That's not what happens when you go see, fill in the name of a current, uh, play
3960600	3962000	that would be funny here.
3962200	3963000	Tap dogs.
3963080	3963440	Right.
3964920	3967840	You want, you want tits and feathers when you get footlights.
3967880	3970800	I mean, like you want to smell the grease paint.
3970800	3974840	You want to, you want to fucking like, I, I'm not saying I can do that.
3975080	3976160	That's from Gar's line.
3976840	3978880	Uh, wrong reference.
3980560	3982360	Well, give me a rent.
3982920	3983400	Oh, rent.
3983400	3983560	Yeah.
3984120	3987160	7,500 minutes in the second.
3987560	3988920	3000 minutes.
3991520	3993680	You turn anything into fiddler on the roof.
3996560	4001800	You could do, you could do Jesus Christ superstar and it would become a matchmaker.
4001800	4003040	Matchmaker make me.
4004160	4005360	No, that's Jewish.
4005480	4010640	Try not to turn on to try not to the problems and upset you.
4010640	4019000	You started to believe the things they say of you.
4019120	4023920	You really do believe this talk of God is true.
4025480	4028200	It's hard to, it's hard to watch that show for the first time and not
4028200	4031720	spend the next six weeks, like, like, like singing every song.
4031720	4031800	I love it.
4031800	4032680	I love that show.
4032920	4036680	Everybody experiences the same thing when they see that show or the album
4036680	4037360	for the first time.
4037600	4038120	It's amazing.
4038720	4039840	Written by Jews, right?
4040360	4043240	I don't think, uh, Andrew DICE, Andrew DICE, right.
4045640	4046440	He can't be Jewish.
4046520	4048080	There's no one with Lloyd in their name.
4048080	4050160	That's what it is.
4050640	4052280	And, uh, and the other guy, right?
4052280	4054240	Take Lloyd, uh, Edward Rice Burroughs.
4055200	4056800	Uh, yeah.
4056840	4057640	Love that musical.
4057640	4058080	Amazing.
4058400	4058960	Incredible.
4059280	4062760	Try not to turn on to problems and upset.
4062800	4063960	Oh, we're going to get copyrighted.
4065200	4066560	But do your version.
4066640	4067920	You can see one line, right?
4068160	4068800	Yeah.
4069840	4074600	I see like a clock.
4074800	4076080	You see a clock all the way back.
4076160	4077080	Yeah, there's one.
4077080	4077960	It's just hard to read.
4077960	4079480	Oh, I got squint at it.
4079560	4079880	Okay.
4079880	4084880	So then the next one would be, I think what comes next is, uh, I'm
4084880	4087360	so old, only the young, it's hard to see.
4087360	4087880	I promise.
4088200	4090400	I feel like I'm doing a death of a salesman.
4092320	4093480	Biff, where are you?
4093480	4106880	Only the young can say they're free to fly away from the movie with Matthew
4106880	4118760	Modi, only the young can say can't leave the key of a, okay.
4119800	4120880	You don't do beats.
4120920	4122280	I thought you had beats on there.
4122600	4123320	You didn't make any beats.
4123400	4124960	I can't change them on the fly.
4125200	4127040	I just, I prepared these little garage.
4127040	4128040	There's a percussion.
4128080	4129920	It's like, there's a two tracks.
4129920	4131160	Well, how much do you want me to get done?
4131160	4133320	I get going from work at six o'clock.
4133320	4134240	I got to come here.
4135520	4137680	I thought maybe you would, you know, I thought maybe on my weekends, you
4137680	4138680	were at least coming up with beats.
4138680	4139640	I'm not going to do nothing.
4139640	4143440	I know weekend step aside, step aside.
4143440	4145480	Casio sound from the seventies.
4147080	4152080	Harmon's back with doctor rhythm like effects.
4152520	4153760	No one knows that reference either.
4154320	4155320	Do you know who doctor rhythm is?
4155320	4156720	Remember, remember the Mr.
4156720	4157520	Microphone commercial.
4157560	4159600	Tell me you remember something from my generation.
4159640	4160000	I was trying.
4160040	4163320	Well, did you watch F Troop after half a true photo?
4163400	4168640	I mean, it's, I, did you remember McCall's Zavy or is it something
4168640	4169840	that you've just heard about?
4170200	4171200	It's the latter.
4171200	4174360	I mean, I've heard about him, but we both know Knight Rider.
4176360	4177360	That's passed my time.
4177400	4177880	How about that?
4177880	4179040	Well, it's your baby.
4179040	4179320	What?
4179880	4181200	I'm so old.
4181520	4184680	Imagine if I was a 60 year old woman as someone pointed out.
4185400	4186640	I don't even understand.
4187480	4191560	Is that like, is that a backwards compliment or is it a prank?
4191680	4193800	It was an answer to your question.
4194040	4198480	In what situation could bragging about burying your children possibly work?
4198520	4201000	And I was like, imagine you're a 60 year old woman.
4201000	4203640	And I was like, trying to find a little bubble there where it's like, you're
4203640	4207640	still, you're, you're, you're after your, you're maybe a widow.
4207680	4210640	Like you lost your first husband to like a snowblower accident.
4210920	4215000	And like, and then there's this like, like, like, like, like fella,
4215000	4217120	does Sam Elliott fella down at the other end.
4217120	4218600	He's got this, he's got his little hat.
4218600	4220840	And then like the bartender says, that's from that fella.
4220840	4224280	And he's like, Hey, just want, you know, better be careful with me.
4224920	4228000	I outlive two of my children want to dance.
4228080	4232920	And then you'd be like, come on, take me away to the honky tonk dream.
4234320	4236520	I don't know why it has to happen in rural America.
4237520	4240080	I guess it just doesn't seem like something would happen in Brooklyn.
4240120	4243360	Like, like, like, Hey, I outlived my kids.
4243400	4244800	Like that would be sad.
4245040	4245760	That would be sad.
4246760	4247560	Fucking kids are dead.
4247760	4248120	Yeah.
4248200	4249160	Like, Oh yeah.
4249160	4251600	Kids are dying at a higher rate than when we were kids.
4251600	4252520	Congratulations.
4252640	4254440	Let's go joke about it in the parking lot.
4254720	4261680	These kids today, they, and they don't know how I, when I started comedy, what
4261680	4268320	I had to do, I had to walk 20 miles to get to the setup of a joke.
4271040	4273320	And then the 20 miles to the punch line.
4275040	4279120	These kids today, and they don't know with the long hair in the rock and roll,
4279880	4281520	their house is in the village though.
4282560	4286080	They will not see me stopping here to watch their woods fill up with snow.
4286200	4287560	David Frost, folks.
4288760	4291600	David Frost is Robert Frost, right?
4292120	4292400	Yeah.
4295200	4297080	I knew I was so one off.
4297960	4303320	Is this at some many miles to go before you, the thing, Mr.
4303320	4304160	Poetry.
4304920	4305480	That's right.
4305480	4306880	There were two Robert Frost poems.
4306880	4308840	They made us memorize in high school that one.
4308880	4310440	Was he the wall guy too?
4310760	4313120	Something there is the, that doesn't love a wall.
4313160	4315640	That sends the frozen ground swell under it.
4316520	4318400	Uh, I think that's, I think that's frost.
4318400	4320440	It might be, uh, what's his pants?
4320440	4321000	Sandburg.
4321080	4321560	What grade?
4322840	4323920	What grade?
4323960	4324200	Yeah.
4325200	4325720	11.
4326200	4327080	Jesus Christ.
4327280	4327640	What?
4328240	4330080	How come I smoke a lot of pot.
4330240	4334440	I can't remember anything.
4334520	4336600	I did not even go to the 11th grade.
4337200	4337880	No, really?
4338360	4339320	Did you drop out?
4339360	4340040	I dropped out.
4340120	4341560	Did you get your GED later?
4341600	4345960	I did get my GED because I did not memorize poetry, but we had to do it in
4345960	4346840	like sixth grade.
4346880	4349320	So I was wondering what kind of public school system you had.
4349320	4350280	That's pretty legit, man.
4350280	4351320	I didn't know that about you.
4351320	4353360	You're kind of, you're, that's kind of gangsta, right?
4354160	4354600	Yeah.
4355320	4356000	Sure is.
4356000	4358040	You're a high school trap out.
4358040	4360920	You know, you wear these suits, but you're, you're, you're legit.
4361440	4364440	Watch out for 11th grade, dude.
4364480	4365560	All you have to do is leave.
4367280	4369360	You don't have to do anything except for stop.
4370400	4372480	The shittiest part is I'd come by for lunch.
4374800	4375720	I'm still hungry.

4414880	4420040	You've got the electric streets rolling down here on your disco feet.
4420040	4421200	Father of a niece.
4421200	4423600	I'll never, never meet.
4424040	4426040	Guitar drums.
4428480	4429520	Robert Winslow.
4437280	4438800	The Robert Winslow.
4438800	4445720	The worst Robert, he would, he would, he would, he would solve harm.
4445720	4451760	If he saw that he'd be like, Michael Winslow, Michael Winslow, his brother,
4451760	4458160	Robert, Robert, Robert, do your sounds.
4458160	4463880	I don't know, but he's the, he's the most talented guy in accounting.

4464800	4469520	Robert, come on, do that thing.
4469520	4474360	I know, you know, like being associated with your famous brother, Michael Winslow,
4474520	4477960	but come on, we're all, we're all 60 years old now.
4477960	4481160	Just do, do, do your helicopter thing by the copy machine.
4485680	4487480	Robert, you are amazing.
4488480	4489480	Phoneticists.
4490520	4493160	You are an amazing oral artist.
4493240	4494760	A-U-R-A-L.
4494760	4496160	It runs in the family.
4497040	4500000	You guys ever watch, he was the original Mitty.
4500360	4501200	I don't know what I'm saying.
4501840	4502840	Is that a thing, Mitty?
4502960	4506040	You guys ever watch those ASMR videos on YouTube?
4506440	4509040	Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm opening up a wrapper.
4509200	4511680	It's me, Tinky Tina.
4513160	4517960	I want, I'm going to rub my fingernails on some pine cones later.
4518960	4523960	I wanted you to know that I got a new microphone.
4524960	4526960	It's the ASR 1000.
4526960	4530960	You can hear here, and you can hear over here.
4531960	4537960	A lot of you keep writing in and asking to hear sucking and kissing sounds.
4540960	4542960	This isn't about that.
4542960	4545960	Wait, don't, oh, don't you just,
4545960	4547960	I just type in ASMR kissing.
4548960	4552960	I'm like, come on, let me, like, kiss my ear.
4556960	4558960	What do you mean, oh.
4558960	4561960	I don't want to see them all, but what am I, what is this?
4561960	4562960	It's like these YouTube videos.
4562960	4564960	It's like porn, but esoteric.
4564960	4565960	But it's like,
4568960	4569960	but it also sort of like,
4569960	4570960	Is that wrong? That's right.
4570960	4573960	Yeah, but also there's a little bit of a blur there where it's like,
4573960	4576960	I think that thinking about it as porn is part, it's like,
4576960	4579960	like part of the shtick is that it's not, it's not really,
4579960	4581960	it's like about relaxing and going to sleep.
4581960	4582960	Like when people cuddle.
4582960	4583960	Oh, okay.
4583960	4587960	Like when you can hire somebody to come over and cuddle is not really sexual.
4587960	4588960	It's just about cuddling.
4588960	4590960	I'm going to be doing some trigger words.
4593960	4594960	Frigidaire.
4595960	4598960	They just like, they do like weird words and like you,
4598960	4600960	they have special microphones that,
4600960	4604960	and you can have special earphones that like trigger, like Cody says,
4604960	4607960	she, like, she, she, there's, there's,
4607960	4609960	there's some people say it's a thing you have.
4609960	4611960	Like, like, like you have a sensitivity.
4611960	4613960	You watch the video and then you have the thing.
4613960	4617960	Well, or, but you can also like have it like a kind of a condition.
4617960	4619960	Like, uh, yeah, no, that's the thing you don't, you don't get,
4619960	4621960	like normal people don't respond,
4621960	4625960	but the people who are sensitive to it, they have, they call them brain gasms.
4625960	4626960	So it's like, they call them brain.
4626960	4628960	What gasms, gasms.
4628960	4629960	Gasms. Oh, yeah.
4629960	4631960	There's different terms, but yeah.
4631960	4633960	That was my first pickup line.
4635960	4637960	Would you like to have a brain gasm?
4637960	4638960	Did he say brain gasm?
4638960	4639960	Yeah.
4639960	4640960	Okay.
4640960	4641960	Yeah, yeah.
4641960	4642960	It just was a weak joke then.
4643960	4646960	I'm trying to think of why I don't get, after everything I say,
4646960	4650960	people are like passing out from laughter in the crowd.
4651960	4652960	Yeah, no.
4652960	4653960	Yeah, I've given up.
4653960	4654960	My condition's getting worse.
4655960	4659960	Uh, I'm worried about, I'm worried about, uh, being too happy.
4660960	4663960	Uh, I don't know if that's a topic.
4664960	4665960	Yeah.
4665960	4666960	That's a topic.
4666960	4667960	That is.
4667960	4669960	I was driving home today and I was like, I'm pretty happy.
4669960	4670960	That's good.
4670960	4673960	Uh, what, uh, what has changed for you that's making you happy?
4673960	4675960	Well, Rick and Morty started up and now we got it, like,
4675960	4678960	and I work for, I go in at 10 and then I'm like, we're taught.
4678960	4681960	And it's just like, everybody's like, come on, let's, let's do this.
4681960	4683960	And I'm like, well, what if we did three times as much?
4683960	4684960	And everyone's like, yeah, let's do it.
4684960	4686960	And it's like, just really a lot of fun talking about it.
4686960	4690960	And then like five o'clock comes and it's like, well, we did twice as much as we
4690960	4691960	wanted to do.
4691960	4692960	I'm going to go home.
4692960	4694960	And then it's like light out and I'm going to drive in home.
4694960	4698960	And like my car's driving itself because I got a Tesla and it's like, uh,
4701960	4702960	timeout.
4702960	4703960	Thank you.
4703960	4704960	High five.
4704960	4705960	Oh, no, come on.
4705960	4706960	This is, this is jealousy.
4706960	4707960	All right.
4707960	4708960	Yeah.
4708960	4709960	This isn't like, yeah,
4710960	4711960	like, whoa.
4712960	4714960	I just let it drive home today.
4714960	4716960	Like it was like driving and then I was like,
4716960	4718960	did you take your hands off the steering wheel?
4718960	4720960	Yeah, I would never leave the house.
4721960	4724960	How, how the fuck is it owning that car?
4724960	4725960	It just drives.
4725960	4728960	But it doesn't, it doesn't like, it doesn't like turn.
4730960	4731960	But it's cruise control.
4731960	4734960	It's like cruise control that it actually works.
4734960	4735960	Yeah.
4735960	4736960	Like it's what it wouldn't.
4736960	4739960	It's not like a, you can't, it won't like take you home.
4740960	4743960	It won't follow the GPS you in a lane, right?
4743960	4744960	Yeah.
4744960	4745960	It's awesome.
4745960	4746960	You can also tell it.
4746960	4748960	You want to change lanes and it'll change lanes better than you can.
4748960	4749960	Cause it'll check the lanes.
4749960	4751960	Unless there's a truck and it's dusk.
4751960	4752960	I don't know.
4754960	4758960	I'm not going to like, I guess that guy was like, it's funny how we coped
4758960	4759960	with that.
4759960	4761960	Like I was like, didn't it kill a guy?
4761960	4764960	And they were like, yeah, but he was like watching the Lion King and like,
4764960	4768960	yeah, no, cause they call it, they call it autopilot, which makes you think,
4768960	4770960	it's autopilot, but it's not.
4770960	4771960	It's cruise control.
4771960	4774960	I don't know if this was the case when, when, when his tragedy happened,
4774960	4776960	but now the thing that the pedestrian thing,
4777960	4778960	he just wasn't paying attention.
4778960	4782960	There was a guy was like a, it was like the first auto drive death because he
4782960	4785960	was like, and they, I don't know if this is victim blaming about this part.
4785960	4787960	It was like the old lady with the coffee for McDonald's.
4788960	4790960	I don't, I don't, but they said there was,
4790960	4794960	there was like Facebook video of the guy like asking for it, you know,
4794960	4797960	like, like, that the guy was like, Hey, look at me, I'm not driving.
4797960	4799960	Like, like, like, like,
4800960	4801960	very happy.
4801960	4804960	But I think that we, as a society, we know that we tend to do that.
4804960	4808960	Like, like, like we, we, if a lawn jar kills a baby, like we fucking,
4808960	4811960	we figure out how to like blame the baby.
4811960	4814960	Like we are a sick, sick, like, uh, people.
4814960	4817960	Uh, so I, I, I'm sure there's, I'm sure no human being does it.
4817960	4819960	But anyways, uh, whatever.
4819960	4822960	What made you, uh, what made you finally bite the bullet and get a car?
4822960	4825960	Uh, I just, I don't like, I closed my Rick and wordy deal.
4825960	4826960	I'm like, fuck you.
4826960	4827960	I'm good.
4827960	4828960	Like, like, like, what's the down payment?
4828960	4831960	And like, you give me the thing and it's like, I don't know.
4831960	4832960	I totally shit.
4832960	4833960	You pick it out.
4833960	4834960	You build it.
4834960	4835960	Or did you just pick what's on the lot?
4835960	4836960	I just know.
4836960	4840960	I was like, I picked, I, I, I leave, he, leave, he took care of it.
4841960	4844960	And then I was like, leave, he would text me and he'd go like,
4844960	4845960	pick a color.
4845960	4848960	And then I was like, moonstone river Brock.
4848960	4850960	And then like, I just, I'm sorry.
4850960	4853960	This car is super fast because it's, there's no engine.
4853960	4854960	So it's just gone.
4854960	4856960	The bottom of it is a big battery.
4856960	4859960	And then the hood has like just a hole in it.
4859960	4863960	Like, uh, you can put like luggage in the front because the bottom's a
4863960	4864960	battery.
4864960	4865960	And then, uh,
4865960	4867960	I know the big guys are with the group.
4867960	4868960	They know what they're doing over there.
4868960	4869960	Yeah.
4870960	4871960	You know what?
4871960	4874960	Well, I mean, he's had a couple of those things where the spaceship goes
4874960	4875960	up and he's right down.
4875960	4879960	No, he's definitely, he's, he's, he's, he's lost steam.
4879960	4881960	Like he was like, like, like now that he's like,
4881960	4882960	he made these submarines.
4882960	4884960	You hear about these submarines.
4884960	4885960	You've been off Twitter, Dan.
4885960	4886960	You hear about these summaries.
4886960	4887960	It's very cool.
4887960	4889960	How many kids are out?
4889960	4890960	How many kids are out?
4890960	4891960	I don't know.
4891960	4892960	They got eight out.
4892960	4894960	They start tomorrow back up to get the other four.
4894960	4896960	There was these trapped cave kids, Dan.
4896960	4898960	They got trapped under water,
4898960	4901960	like in a air pocket and they sent,
4901960	4903960	they're sending teams to rescue him.
4903960	4904960	And Elon Musk is like,
4904960	4907960	what if we had these tiny submarines?
4907960	4908960	But did he get them there?
4908960	4909960	No, they were still building them.
4909960	4910960	No, he's,
4910960	4912960	he's currently still testing as far as I understand.
4912960	4915960	He threw them off schedule because they were waiting
4915960	4918960	for the shipment of the tiny submarine and they,
4918960	4919960	and they missed a chance.
4919960	4920960	No, he,
4920960	4922960	I think he was just like as a thought exercise,
4922960	4924960	just like here's what would work, but you know,
4924960	4925960	I don't,
4925960	4926960	he's not Puerto Rico.
4926960	4927960	Say again.
4927960	4928960	Oh yeah.
4928960	4929960	Did he actually do anything?
4929960	4930960	Just said he would do some stuff.
4930960	4931960	Well, I think he did.
4931960	4932960	Yeah.
4932960	4933960	I think he did a little in Puerto Rico.
4933960	4934960	Like I think,
4934960	4935960	I don't know how much it worked.
4935960	4936960	Yeah.
4936960	4937960	He wanted to use those power walls,
4937960	4938960	the Tesla power wall.
4938960	4939960	Right.
4939960	4940960	Yeah.
4940960	4941960	I mean,
4941960	4942960	I think Puerto Rico see how they ran and it didn't really,
4942960	4943960	uh, didn't take.
4943960	4944960	Yeah.
4944960	4945960	It wasn't a huge change.
4945960	4946960	Meanwhile,
4946960	4947960	how long can you be in a cave filled with water?
4947960	4948960	What's going on with these kids?
4948960	4949960	Not that much longer.
4949960	4951960	Not that much longer because so a monsoon is coming.
4951960	4952960	Right.
4952960	4953960	It's bad.
4953960	4954960	I mean,
4954960	4955960	I have a million questions,
4955960	4956960	but I guess that's why it's a captivating story.
4956960	4957960	Yeah.
4957960	4958960	Cause it's like a weird,
4958960	4959960	like unbelievable Chilean miners.
4959960	4960960	This,
4960960	4963960	they're pumping water out of this cave fashion.
4963960	4964960	It's coming in.
4964960	4965960	They're bringing oxygen.
4965960	4966960	Oxygen.
4966960	4967960	What part of the world?
4967960	4972960	This is in Thailand where I spent my earlier and,
4972960	4973960	uh,
4973960	4976960	I have no idea where anything is.
4976960	4980960	I don't even know where,
4980960	4982960	I know where most things in LA are.
4982960	4983960	You're welcome.
4983960	4984960	Uh,
4984960	4985960	how are you?
4985960	4986960	How are you with road rage?
4986960	4987960	Uh,
4987960	4988960	what do you mean?
4988960	4989960	Like,
4989960	4992960	I don't see you being that good at it.
4992960	4993960	You mean where he would get angry,
4993960	4994960	you think?
4994960	4995960	Yeah.
4995960	4996960	I'm not good at road rage.
4996960	4997960	Do you get road rage?
4997960	4998960	No.
4998960	4999960	No.
4999960	5000960	Really?
5000960	5001960	Well,
5001960	5002960	I,
5002960	5003960	I would,
5003960	5004960	I assume everyone's mad at me when I leave the house.
5004960	5005960	Like I,
5005960	5006960	I'm always like,
5006960	5007960	don't beat me up.
5007960	5008960	Like,
5008960	5009960	like,
5009960	5010960	like car wise,
5010960	5011960	like don't,
5011960	5012960	like I check my,
5012960	5013960	I just like,
5013960	5014960	I,
5014960	5016960	my fear of like being the reason someone honks is like crippling.
5016960	5017960	So.
5017960	5018960	Because of the car you're driving.
5018960	5019960	Is that what you were there?
5019960	5020960	No,
5020960	5021960	just in general.
5021960	5022960	That's why I was happy to not drive for what?
5022960	5023960	Six years.
5023960	5024960	How long were you driving me around?
5024960	5025960	Yeah.
5025960	5026960	I was like,
5026960	5027960	I got,
5027960	5029960	I got the divorce and like McGathey had been using my Prius.
5029960	5030960	And I just,
5030960	5031960	I was like,
5031960	5032960	you know,
5032960	5033960	she's like,
5033960	5034960	I was like,
5034960	5035960	yeah,
5035960	5036960	take the Prius.
5036960	5037960	You painted it lime green.
5037960	5038960	Like,
5038960	5039960	like she,
5039960	5040960	it was a beautiful,
5040960	5041960	beautiful little,
5041960	5042960	little buggy.
5042960	5043960	It was more hers than mine.
5043960	5044960	So,
5044960	5045960	and then I was like,
5045960	5046960	you take it.
5046960	5047960	I'm going to get a,
5047960	5048960	I'm going to get a fucking fancy car next.
5048960	5049960	Like,
5049960	5050960	and then I was like,
5050960	5051960	I can't afford a fancy car.
5051960	5053960	I just got divorced and waited like a long time.
5053960	5054960	And then,
5054960	5055960	and then the last one I had,
5055960	5057960	and then just waited and waited and waited.
5057960	5058960	What was my point?
5058960	5059960	Why you got this one?
5059960	5060960	Oh yeah.
5060960	5061960	Well,
5061960	5062960	and I was like,
5062960	5063960	but that whole time I was like,
5063960	5065960	I don't really need to drive or want to,
5065960	5066960	because it's a little,
5066960	5070960	I feel like I'm getting on the playground every time I get in a car.
5070960	5071960	Because you're not used to driving.
5071960	5072960	I just,
5072960	5073960	I just worry,
5073960	5075960	I just have a high anxiety about disappointing people,
5075960	5076960	like cutting people off.
5076960	5077960	And like,
5077960	5078960	like,
5078960	5079960	again,
5079960	5080960	being the reason someone honks,
5080960	5081960	it drives me crazy.
5081960	5082960	Like if somebody,
5082960	5083960	if I'm like,
5083960	5084960	I almost hit you.
5084960	5085960	And then they're like,
5085960	5086960	I guess I would,
5086960	5087960	you know,
5087960	5088960	when I was a kid,
5088960	5089960	like a guy,
5089960	5090960	I guess I cut a guy off and,
5090960	5091960	and he,
5091960	5092960	he flipped,
5092960	5093960	he was,
5093960	5094960	he did that and he like honked and then he flipped me the finger.
5094960	5095960	And it was like,
5095960	5096960	I was like,
5096960	5097960	I'm sorry.
5097960	5098960	And then he was just like,
5098960	5099960	fuck you.
5099960	5100960	And then he got in front of me and then I just followed him for 40 minutes.
5100960	5101960	So like,
5101960	5102960	yeah.
5102960	5103960	So like I said,
5103960	5104960	you could sense him starting to get increasingly terrified as the sun went down.
5104960	5105960	And then he was like,
5105960	5106960	I'm sorry.
5106960	5107960	I'm sorry.
5107960	5108960	And then he was just like,
5108960	5109960	fuck you.
5109960	5110960	And like,
5110960	5114960	he could sense him starting to get increasingly terrified as the sun went down.
5114960	5115960	Cause he's like,
5115960	5116960	wait a minute.
5116960	5117960	I live in Cedarburg.
5117960	5118960	And I was like,
5118960	5119960	so do I,
5119960	5120960	or,
5120960	5123880	or can you never stop?
5123880	5124880	Because I was like 20 years old.
5124880	5125880	And I was like,
5125880	5126880	that guy,
5126880	5127880	that's what went through my head.
5127880	5128880	It was,
5128880	5129880	it was like,
5129880	5130880	geez,
5130880	5131880	that guy's so mean.
5131880	5132880	I would never,
5132880	5133880	if someone had cut me off,
5133880	5134880	I wouldn't,
5134880	5135880	I wouldn't,
5135880	5136880	I wouldn't like honk my horn,
5136880	5137880	but I wouldn't like lay on it and then flip the guy off and mouth the words,
5137880	5138880	fuck you.
5138880	5143200	And then the guy knows I could be a psycho.
5143200	5145040	For all he knows,
5145040	5147040	I could be a psycho.
5147040	5148040	Oh.
5148040	5150040	And it's like,
5150040	5153480	maybe I am a psycho.
5153480	5157160	What's the difference between a psycho and a normal person doesn't,
5157160	5160160	if a normal person lays on their horn and mouths,
5160160	5161160	fuck you,
5161160	5164400	in spite of clearly being unable to physically take you,
5164400	5165400	like,
5165400	5166400	I'll just,
5166400	5171760	maybe a psycho is the guy that just patiently has nothing to do for the rest of his day.
5171760	5172760	I just want to,
5172760	5173760	and the,
5173760	5174760	and the,
5174760	5175760	I remember the guy,
5175760	5178840	the guy came to a stop sign and there was a car between us.
5178840	5179840	He had managed to get,
5179840	5180840	like,
5180840	5181840	get one car between us on this,
5181840	5182840	like,
5182840	5183840	county highway.
5183840	5184840	And he came to a stop sign.
5184840	5186160	And my biggest victory is,
5186160	5187760	he fucking peeled out,
5187760	5189600	ran the stop sign,
5189600	5190600	and like,
5190600	5192480	almost got hit by another car as he like,
5192480	5193480	sped away.
5193480	5194480	And I was like,
5194480	5195480	I was like,
5195600	5196600	I was like,
5196600	5197600	still,
5197600	5200040	I'm still behind you.
5200040	5201040	And he just like,
5201040	5203240	he just kept going off into the fucking country.
5203240	5205740	He was headed for Canada.
5205740	5206960	And I was so proud of myself.
5206960	5207960	I just eventually like,
5207960	5211960	I waited for him to get over a hill and then I was like slowed down and then I was like,
5211960	5212960	like, went away.
5212960	5213960	And I was like,
5213960	5216000	I fucking did something right today.
5216000	5218000	It sounds like, yes.
5218000	5219000	Yes.
5219000	5220000	Yes.
5220000	5222200	You had an experience.
5222200	5223200	Because that guy,
5223240	5224560	now that guy,
5224560	5226240	next time he gets road rage,
5226240	5228480	like I accept that I did something wrong.
5228480	5229480	I cut it.
5229480	5231440	I fucked up behind the wheel of a car.
5231440	5234040	Like I made a mistake that was just courteous to him.
5234040	5235120	I didn't check.
5235120	5236440	I didn't see him or something.
5236440	5238000	I did something wrong.
5238000	5239000	But,
5239000	5240000	but you know,
5240000	5241480	like also though,
5241480	5244360	the reason I did it wrong is probably because I didn't have my full brain.
5244360	5245360	It's like,
5245360	5246360	like he,
5246360	5247360	the time he spent like,
5247360	5250880	turning his head 90 degrees and yelling fuck you and all this stuff is like,
5250880	5251880	you're,
5251880	5255760	you're exactly worshipful of the safety of the roads yourself.
5255760	5256760	Like,
5256760	5257760	like when,
5257760	5258760	when the mood takes you,
5258760	5263360	you'll pay attention to all manner of things like you're driving into oncoming traffic
5263360	5267560	so that you can flip me off like you're the dukes of hazard.
5267560	5268560	So I think,
5268560	5269560	yeah,
5269560	5270560	I did the right thing that day.
5270560	5271560	I changed a man,
5271560	5272560	I think.
5272560	5274600	I taught a man to fish instead of giving him a fish,
5274600	5275600	you know,
5275600	5276600	like I,
5276600	5277600	he's going to,
5277600	5278600	he's going to,
5278600	5279600	he's going to handle his,
5279600	5280600	his altercations on the highway differently.
5280600	5282320	He's going to handle your kid's life.
5282320	5283320	You,
5283320	5284320	you are a hero.
5284320	5285320	We'll never know.
5285320	5286480	When I think of heroes,
5286480	5287480	I think of you.
5287480	5288480	I have,
5288480	5291720	have I mentioned I have OCD because the worst thing about OCD,
5291720	5293680	and I didn't know this when I first got OCD,
5293680	5296720	but if you look it up in front of the main symptoms,
5296720	5300840	because you think you may have hit somebody in your car.
5300840	5301840	And then you have the,
5301840	5302840	exactly.
5302840	5306200	That's the same as alcoholism.
5306200	5307200	Same symptom.
5307200	5308200	I have that.
5308200	5309200	Yeah, that's right.
5309200	5310200	Every morning.
5310800	5311800	You know,
5311800	5313280	that's the other thing is that now that you drive,
5313280	5314280	has that changed?
5314280	5315280	No, I don't drive.
5315280	5319480	I told you.
5319480	5320680	We're fine.
5320680	5325240	This guy's making submarines that can rescue kids from caves.
5325240	5330080	You don't think he's got my back?
5330080	5331880	What will you remedy?
5331880	5332880	Since you're so happy,
5332880	5333880	what's the remedy?
5333880	5334880	Usually self-destruction.
5334880	5335880	Like,
5335880	5336880	I don't know.
5336880	5337880	Yeah.
5337880	5338880	Yeah.
5338880	5339880	I don't know.
5340560	5341560	I just noticed,
5341560	5342560	I think that,
5342560	5343560	well,
5343560	5346560	my goal is to not self-destruct.
5346560	5347560	Like,
5347560	5348560	that's why my therapist,
5348560	5349560	she's like,
5349560	5350560	just put it,
5350560	5351560	just don't fuck,
5351560	5352560	you know,
5352560	5353560	like don't,
5353560	5354560	like guys like you,
5354560	5355560	she said,
5355560	5356560	you know,
5356560	5357560	huh,
5357560	5358560	well,
5358560	5359560	this will be interesting.
5359560	5360560	Like guys like you,
5360560	5361560	you,
5361560	5362560	half of you,
5362560	5363560	on average,
5363560	5364560	like you go and be happy,
5364560	5365560	and then the other half of you like put on some slippers
5365560	5366560	and drink yourself to death.
5366560	5367560	And she was like,
5367560	5368560	oh,
5368560	5369560	let's see what happens.
5369920	5370920	And is it,
5370920	5371920	is this based on how much
5371920	5372920	she's getting paid?
5372920	5373920	Yeah,
5373920	5374920	I don't know.
5374920	5375920	I think she knows,
5375920	5376920	like,
5376920	5377920	what pushes my buttons.
5377920	5378920	She knows that that's
5378920	5379920	gonna make me go,
5379920	5380920	I'll show you.
5380920	5381920	Yeah.
5381920	5382920	That's why she said slippers.
5382920	5383920	She was kind of enticing you.
5383920	5384920	Didn't she say slippers?
5384920	5385920	I know.
5385920	5386920	Well,
5386920	5387920	that's what hit home.
5387920	5388920	Because I would have,
5388920	5389920	I would have,
5389920	5390920	if she hadn't said that,
5390920	5391920	then I would have thought,
5391920	5392920	oh,
5392920	5393920	I'm not gonna be this,
5393920	5394920	who's this other guy?
5394920	5395920	Yeah.
5395920	5396920	Like,
5396920	5397920	but the slippers drove it home.
5397920	5398920	It was like,
5399760	5400760	that,
5400760	5401760	that guy is like,
5401760	5402760	oh,
5402760	5403760	I'm wearing slippers.
5403760	5404760	I fucking did it.
5404760	5405760	I'm Joe Walsh in
5405760	5406760	The Life of Illusion.
5406760	5407760	You know,
5407760	5408760	like,
5408760	5409760	I'm fucking,
5409760	5410760	like,
5410760	5411760	you know.
5411760	5412760	Is that the
5412760	5413760	Eagles,
5413760	5414760	Joe Walsh?
5414760	5415760	Yeah,
5415760	5416760	yeah.
5416760	5417760	Oh,
5417760	5418760	okay.
5418760	5419760	Because all of a sudden,
5419760	5420760	I thought about the other
5420760	5421760	horrible Joe Walsh.
5421760	5422760	Yeah,
5422760	5423760	life's been good to me so far.
5423760	5424760	Like,
5424760	5425760	Joe Walsh was like,
5425760	5426760	wait,
5426760	5427760	what's that?
5427760	5428760	What's that song?
5429760	5430760	Yeah.
5430760	5431760	And now I don't drive.
5431760	5432760	Yeah.
5432760	5433760	Look,
5433760	5435760	I didn't come here tonight telling
5435760	5437760	you I was knocking out with my voice.
5437760	5438760	All right?
5438760	5439760	My voice is raspy.
5439760	5440760	It's not a bit.
5440760	5441760	What do you get?
5441760	5442760	My man's a rat.
5442760	5443760	What is that?
5443760	5444760	That's Ron Stewart.
5444760	5445760	How many quarts of
5445760	5446760	cum have you had to drink
5446760	5447760	tonight?
5447760	5456760	You know,
5456760	5457760	that's the thing.
5458760	5459760	I,
5459760	5461760	the only great reason I know that
5461760	5463760	I've tried semen is because I,
5463760	5464760	I tried,
5464760	5465760	uh,
5465760	5466760	I was gonna make a
5466760	5467760	kumbaka joke.
5467760	5468760	Semen.
5468760	5469760	I don't know.
5469760	5470760	Have I had semen?
5470760	5471760	I've had some of the
5471760	5472760	kombucha.
5472760	5474760	How do you pronounce it?
5474760	5475760	It's the most
5475760	5477760	horrible thing I've ever heard of.
5477760	5478760	You take it,
5478760	5479760	it's all,
5479760	5480760	it's ruined.
5480760	5481760	It's already fermented.
5481760	5482760	They go,
5482760	5483760	yeah.
5483760	5484760	That's good.
5484760	5485760	You know it's terrible,
5485760	5486760	right?
5486760	5487760	Okay.
5487760	5488760	It's,
5488760	5489760	if it's the only thing on the menu.
5489760	5490760	It's,
5490760	5491760	that means that the food's gone bad.
5491760	5492760	I get it.
5492760	5493760	These kids,
5493760	5494760	they got a,
5494760	5495760	they don't,
5495760	5496760	they,
5496760	5497760	they,
5497760	5498760	they come into a world where we tell them
5498760	5499760	there's two flavors of corn syrup and then they,
5499760	5500760	they had to do something to rebel.
5500760	5501760	They,
5501760	5502760	they couldn't just be like,
5502760	5503760	we'll have water.
5503760	5504760	Like they had to like figure out new things
5504760	5505760	to do with fruit.
5505760	5506760	It's all,
5506760	5507760	it's all we left them.
5507760	5508760	Like there's only,
5508760	5509760	there's only so many ways to be hip when you come
5509760	5510760	into the fucking world.
5510760	5511760	It's all,
5511760	5512760	it's all we left them.
5512760	5513760	Like there's only,
5513760	5515760	there's only so many ways to be hip when you come
5515760	5518760	into the fucking Orwell's like THX 1138,
5518760	5520760	fucking Coke and Pepsi,
5520760	5523760	Chrome hallways with interspaced vending machines
5523760	5526760	with two kinds of drink owned by one company.
5526760	5527760	They're like,
5527760	5528760	Oh my God.
5528760	5529760	I think I'll be a foodie.
5529760	5530760	Whoa.
5530760	5533760	You're making me see through the game.
5533760	5534760	You know,
5534760	5536760	the vending machines are getting really good.
5536760	5537760	Is that true?
5537760	5538760	I,
5538760	5539760	they have apps now.
5539760	5540760	You don't have to deal with the gross money.
5540760	5542760	Have you been to horn and hard arts?
5542760	5543760	No.
5543760	5544760	I just want to put,
5544760	5546760	I'm the oldest person in the room.
5546760	5548760	It's an automat.
5548760	5550760	Famous automat in the 50s.
5550760	5551760	What's an automat?
5551760	5552760	Is that like a roof?
5552760	5554760	Put some money in and like you put money in,
5554760	5555760	a sandwich comes out.
5555760	5557760	It's a store of vending machines.
5557760	5558760	It's just a store full of vending machines.
5558760	5559760	It's a plastic,
5559760	5562760	it's a plastic construction of a,
5562760	5565760	of a structure that has little holes.
5565760	5567760	And you put money in and like,
5567760	5569760	Oh, there's a little soup for you.
5569760	5570760	And then,
5570760	5571760	and then.
5571760	5572760	Yeah.
5572760	5574760	How about a glass of tomatoes?
5574760	5577760	Horn and hard arts.
5577760	5579760	Why don't you people.
5579760	5582760	Meet more old people.
5582760	5584760	Can't let it go.
5584760	5586760	The old references.
5586760	5590760	You learn something.
5590760	5591760	So wait,
5591760	5592760	is there a guy on the other side?
5592760	5593760	Yeah.
5593760	5594760	There's like a cafeteria on the other side.
5594760	5595760	And then they're like,
5595760	5596760	Oh,
5596760	5598760	let's put in a new bowl in this window.
5598760	5600760	But you're not supposed to be waving at that guy.
5600760	5601760	No, no, you don't see it.
5601760	5604760	You're supposed to be living in the magic of,
5604760	5605760	I can't believe it.
5605760	5606760	Is this what they do?
5606760	5608760	They do the IKEA too, sort of, right?
5608760	5610760	Do you put your money in a slot?
5610760	5611760	They do it in other countries.
5611760	5612760	It's like a big.
5612760	5613760	Yes.
5613760	5614760	You walk by a wall or a drawer.
5614760	5616760	Or a slot, I think.
5616760	5617760	Yeah.
5617760	5618760	It's a vending machine.
5618760	5620760	So each little window is equipped with electronic.
5620760	5621760	Hell no.
5621760	5624760	Maybe there's one on the side you put it in
5624760	5626760	like a regular vending machine.
5626760	5629760	My memory of it is that
5629760	5633760	you would put the money in the individual cubicle.
5633760	5634760	Sit him down.
5634760	5635760	Let him go.
5635760	5636760	But I don't know.
5636760	5637760	Get the table out of the way.
5637760	5638760	I'm talking out of my ass.
5638760	5640760	Get the table out of the way.
5640760	5641760	I'm all right.
5641760	5642760	I'm all right.
5642760	5643760	I'm all right.
5643760	5645760	I want to go to it.
5645760	5647760	I want to eat it in an automat.
5647760	5651760	Somebody had orange juice.
5651760	5652760	I can't believe it.
5652760	5653760	It's in the song.
5653760	5656760	It's in a song from the Pit Show Hair.
5656760	5659760	Do you know that I went to see hair?
5659760	5660760	This is how old I am.
5660760	5661760	Let's let it all hang out.
5661760	5663760	I was 12 years old, 1968.
5663760	5665760	And when I went to see hair,
5665760	5667760	and I was wearing a double-breasted jacket
5667760	5669760	with a medallion on,
5669760	5672760	and it was the original Broadway cast,
5672760	5674760	and we got separated from the group
5674760	5678760	and got mugged, my friend and I.
5678760	5680760	And when I say mugged, I don't mean beaten up.
5680760	5682760	I mean held up with knives and guns.
5682760	5683760	You're kidding me.
5683760	5684760	Yeah.
5684760	5686760	So coming out of hair?
5686760	5690760	We came out of hair, and me and Jeff Stein,
5690760	5692760	we started walking.
5692760	5694760	And you're like, we don't even need our school.
5694760	5696760	Let's be alone in New York.
5696760	5699760	I've realized the therapy now.
5699760	5701760	It was really their responsibility.
5701760	5703760	You've forgiven yourself.
5703760	5705760	You're blaming yourself for your mugging at 12.
5705760	5708760	Yeah, I blame myself every time I think of it.
5708760	5711760	I feel shame until I realize, no, no, Andy.
5711760	5713760	You're 12 years old.
5713760	5717760	If a junior high class goes into Manhattan,
5717760	5719760	someone should be watching out.
5719760	5720760	Right.
5720760	5723760	Just to make sure you don't turn into Batman.
5723760	5725760	Yeah.
5725760	5729760	Were you able to replace this medallion?
5729760	5731760	I couldn't be mixing up two stories,
5731760	5733760	because my sixth grade...
5733760	5735760	My sixth grade...
5735760	5738760	The only problem I ever went to was in sixth grade.
5738760	5740760	When I graduated from high school,
5740760	5743760	it was cool to not do anything fun.
5743760	5745760	We were like, yeah.
5745760	5747760	Those assholes went to the prom, huh?
5747760	5749760	Losers.
5749760	5751760	But my sixth grade prom, I wore a turtleneck.
5751760	5753760	I wore a double-breasted suit.
5753760	5755760	I wore a golden medallion.
5755760	5756760	Were you a...
5756760	5758760	I spilled grape juice all over my...
5758760	5760760	What was the medallion for?
5760760	5762760	They're the stupidest things.
5762760	5764760	Were you a pimp?
5764760	5765760	It's like a pimp.
5765760	5766760	Did you say, were you a pimp?
5766760	5768760	Yeah.
5769760	5772760	I'm 12 years old, trying to get tickets to hair.
5772760	5774760	You think I...
5774760	5776760	I love your austere pimp.
5776760	5780760	He's got one golden medallion just for pimping.
5780760	5781760	I'm surprised...
5781760	5783760	State champion pimping.
5783760	5785760	Hey, yeah.
5785760	5788760	I'm surprised you got bugged with that kind of attitude.
5788760	5789760	Hey.
5789760	5792760	I put my energy into the actual pimping, thank you.
5792760	5794760	I'm not ostentatious about it.
5794760	5796760	I wear one of these at a time.
5796760	5798760	I have several.
5798760	5801760	I've taken regionals many years in a row.
5801760	5806760	Look, the money don't care where the bitches come from.
5806760	5808760	I got a golden medallion for pimping.
5808760	5810760	I wish I had even one saying like that.
5810760	5811760	A medallion.
5811760	5813760	This medallion, I'm so sorry, I'm obsessed with it.
5813760	5814760	No, me too.
5814760	5816760	It's fine to focus on this.
5816760	5818760	It's 1968.
5818760	5821760	Think of maybe one of your grandparents were hippies.
5821760	5825760	It was 1968, and they had these things like medallions.
5825760	5826760	Was it pinned?
5826760	5827760	Is it pinned?
5827760	5828760	No, it's like a pendant.
5828760	5830760	It's like a gold medallion.
5830760	5832760	With a red, white, and blue ribbon?
5832760	5833760	No, no.
5833760	5834760	Everything was gold.
5834760	5836760	It's not like an Olympic gold.
5836760	5837760	Was it also?
5837760	5838760	Yeah, it was like a...
5838760	5843760	Oh, you had a silver medal in the fourth grade Olympics.
5843760	5844760	I had my silver medal.
5844760	5845760	That was cool.
5845760	5846760	Gold was out.
5846760	5847760	Silver was in.
5847760	5850760	Usually for luging.
5850760	5851760	Was it...
5851760	5853760	So big, little...
5853760	5854760	It was big.
5854760	5855760	Was it real gold?
5855760	5856760	It was so cute.
5856760	5857760	So real gold?
5857760	5858760	It was adorable.
5858760	5859760	What's that?
5859760	5860760	Real gold?
5860760	5861760	No.
5861760	5862760	Okay.
5862760	5863760	That would be terrible.
5863760	5871560	Andy, we gave you that actual real gold medallion for your trip with our grand...
5871560	5872560	Your grandmother.
5872560	5873560	My parents didn't talk like that.
5873560	5878520	Your grandmother gave it to us from the old country.
5878520	5880760	Your parents were Joan Collins from...
5880760	5881760	Yes.
5881760	5882760	Transylvania.
5882760	5884760	They poured over this very...
5884760	5886760	Did these thieves take the medallion?
5886760	5888760	No, but I'll tell you what happened though.
5888760	5889760	They said...
5889760	5890760	Give me your mind.
5890760	5893760	Give me your mind with this kind of emotion.
5893760	5895760	Keep the medallion.
5895760	5897760	Typical New York story.
5897760	5900760	We ran into a store to get away from them.
5900760	5901760	A bodega.
5901760	5902760	And the guy said...
5902760	5904760	Can we use your phone?
5904760	5905760	No.
5907760	5908760	Seriously.
5908760	5909760	Get the hell out.
5909760	5910760	We go back out.
5910760	5911760	Then another guy comes up.
5911760	5912760	He's got a car.
5912760	5913760	He's got a knife.
5913760	5914760	Shut up.
5914760	5915760	He goes, I'll protect you from these guys.
5915760	5916760	What?
5916760	5917760	No.
5917760	5918760	I'll protect you from these guys.
5918760	5919760	I'll protect you from these guys.
5919760	5920760	You're joking.
5920760	5921760	I'm not kidding.
5921760	5922760	He's going like this.
5922760	5923760	Going like this.
5923760	5924760	Was he a dancer?
5924760	5926760	We ran into another hotel.
5926760	5928760	Another hotel?
5928760	5929760	You said another hotel.
5929760	5930760	The hotel, Dixie.
5930760	5931760	The hotel, Dixie.
5931760	5935760	You are a 12-year-old with a turtleneck, a medallion, and you head into a hotel?
5935760	5936760	No, no, no.
5936760	5937760	That's not a hotel.
5937760	5938760	He was a pimp.
5938760	5939760	That's pimp.
5939760	5940760	We headed to the hotel lobby.
5940760	5941760	You were a pimp.
5941760	5942760	It was 42nd and 8th.
5942760	5943760	42nd and 8th.
5943760	5944760	And it was near the Hotel Dixie.
5944760	5945760	These facts are in my mind.
5945760	5946760	And the moral of the story was that I was so scared to call my parents, I literally
5946760	5947760	would have died if my friend Jeff didn't call his parents, because I didn't want to tell
5947760	5948760	them that I got into this predicament.
5948760	5949760	And they never found out.
5949760	5950760	What were you afraid your parents' reaction would be?
5950760	5951760	Nice going, schmuck.
5951760	5955460	Maybe we'll outlive you.
5955460	5956460	Exactly.
5956460	5960400	How can you not...what kind of parent would you...they would.
5960400	5968000	Like,buf...you know, one of the parents would be like, oh, you know, what's the real
5968000	5969000	problem?
5969000	5974080	Well, I'm just...I'm just a little bit sorry for the fact that they're all the same.
5974080	5979720	I'm just a little bit worried about the fact that they're all the same.
5979720	5984720	You know what? I'm gonna come down there and stab you myself.
5984720	5989720	You're not meant to live going around getting almost stabbed.
5989720	5993720	Because how could you lose your way with the other way?
5993720	5996720	There's a red carpet leading you to the exit.
5996720	5998720	There's a lobby full of people.
5998720	6001720	Follow the people. Don't follow the no people.
6001720	6005720	You get stabbed that way, you schmendrick.
6005720	6006720	Nice going.
6006720	6007720	What's a schmendrick?
6007720	6012720	It's like a schmuck, but it's more horizontal.
6012720	6015720	A schmendrick is a guy...
6015720	6021720	It's the schmucks and schmendricks are the longitude and latitude of...
6021720	6026720	They used to say a schlemiel, and the schlemiel gets soup.
6026720	6028720	You know that one, the schlemiel? Someone knows this.
6028720	6030720	The schlemiel...
6030720	6033720	Schlamazzo does what?
6033720	6035720	They're doing the...
6035720	6038720	They're doing Laverde and Shirley.
6038720	6043720	One of the guys gets the soup spilled on them, and the other guy spills the soup.
6043720	6048720	And we'll be back with the worst panel stories of all time.
6048720	6050720	Next question.
6050720	6056720	Yes, Mr. Kindler, I am a proud serviceman in our United States Naval Academy.
6056720	6061720	What is the difference between a schlemiel and a schmazzo?
6061720	6064720	Also, is your show planning on including any characters
6064720	6066720	that are proud to serve in your country's military?
6066720	6068720	Thank you very much.
6068720	6070720	All right.
6070720	6071720	Yes.
6071720	6072720	Schmuck is...
6072720	6075720	A penis is a schmuck, but so is putz.
6075720	6077720	There's a lot of words for penis.
6077720	6078720	Kooshermuck.
6078720	6079720	Yeah, deal with it, people.
6079720	6081720	Yeah, it's blue material.
6081720	6083720	They can't deal with it, right?
6083720	6084720	Sorry.
6084720	6086720	Is a schmendrick like a...
6086720	6087720	It's like a...
6087720	6088720	Well, whatever.
6088720	6089720	I already asked an answer.
6089720	6090720	He's not as bad as a schm...
6090720	6091720	Who knows?
6091720	6092720	Someone here has to get his...
6092720	6093720	It's almost like a...
6093720	6096720	It sounds like there's a little bit of a mensch in a schmendrick.
6096720	6097720	Oh.
6097720	6098720	Like he's well-attended.
6098720	6100720	He's not a schmuck, but he means well.
6100720	6101720	So he's a schmendrick.
6101720	6102720	That could be right.
6102720	6103720	I'm just going like by phonetics.
6103720	6104720	But there's a snorer.
6104720	6105720	A snorer.
6105720	6106720	A snorer.
6106720	6107720	A snorer.
6107720	6108720	He's like, no, it's just a...
6108720	6111720	That's the guy who lights the middle candle on Hanukkah.
6111720	6113720	No, he's the guy who...
6113720	6119720	He's the guy who always leaves his pot at home and he wants your pot.
6119720	6122720	These examples they gave you to learn these words.
6122720	6123720	So...
6123720	6129720	He's the guy that makes a golem to attack your sister's wedding.
6129720	6131720	Oh, gotcha.
6131720	6133720	I'll remember that.
6133720	6136720	Good mnemonic device from the fucking Sumeria.
6136720	6137720	Sumeria.
6137720	6142720	Hey, it wasn't easy growing up Ashkenazik, my friends.
6142720	6144720	You know what a schlemusel is.
6144720	6145720	He's a guy.
6145720	6146720	You got ten pots of clay.
6146720	6148720	You're trying to make a roof.
6148720	6149720	The guy brings a stick.
6149720	6151720	You know what I'm saying?
6151720	6153720	He's a schlemusel.
6153720	6154720	Schlemusel.
6154720	6155720	Got it.
6155720	6156720	Got it.
6156720	6157720	Okay.
6157720	6158720	He's a real Gilgamesh.
6158720	6159720	You know what I'm saying?
6159720	6163720	He's the oldest recorded kind of person.
6163720	6164720	What a punum.
6164720	6165720	What a punum on you.
6165720	6166720	What a stand-up punum.
6166720	6167720	What a punum.
6167720	6168720	What a punum punum punum.
6168720	6170720	That would be his face.
6170720	6171720	We did...
6171720	6172720	We did...
6172720	6173720	23's could do our whole...
6173720	6174720	We'll read through a whole show.
6174720	6175720	Yeah.
6175720	6177720	We don't have to do shit at this point.
6177720	6178720	Oh, we nailed it, right?
6178720	6181720	We don't have a more workout song to go out on, perhaps.
6181720	6182720	Oh, we do.
6182720	6183720	Always close with the song.
6183720	6185720	We don't have any MC Gun Control.
6185720	6187720	We don't have any...
6187720	6192720	When I was in the Yiddish theater and we didn't have...
6192720	6193720	They'd say, what's wrong?
6193720	6196720	I'd say, you're speaking Yiddish, you idiots.
6196720	6197720	That's why they died.
6197720	6198720	MC Gun Control.
6198720	6199720	No.
6199720	6200720	Gun Control.
6200720	6201720	Sorry.
6201720	6202720	Sorry.
6202720	6203720	MC Gun Control.
6203720	6206720	I get confused about my name.
6206720	6210720	I feel like my name should be MC Gun Awareness.
6210720	6213720	Save it for the verse.
6213720	6214720	Let's get a beat.
6214720	6218720	It's me, MC Gun Control.
6218720	6219720	Yeah.
6219720	6220720	Yeah.
6220720	6221720	Yeah.
6221720	6226720	MC Gun Control.
6226720	6228720	Click, click, clack, clack.
6228720	6229720	Bang, bang.
6229720	6231720	What's up with that?
6231720	6233720	Guns all around.
6233720	6235720	Are you aware of them?
6235720	6238720	They're dangerous, motherfucker.
6238720	6239720	Yeah.
6239720	6245720	Guns.
6245720	6248720	Bang, bang, bang.
6248720	6249720	Bang, bang.
6249720	6251720	MC Gun Control.
6251720	6253720	Guns are my fame.
6253720	6258720	Awareness of guns and control.
6258720	6260720	I got a roll.
6260720	6261720	Guns.
6261720	6269720	The AK-47 is the most devastating weapon in the known universe.
6269720	6272720	Gun Control.
6272720	6281720	The joke is, once again, you don't know what side I'm on.
6281720	6283720	You reach it for acceptance.
6283720	6287720	At this point, the joke has become, I explained the joke.
6287720	6288720	Yes.
6288720	6293720	And do the joke, so I...
6293720	6296720	There's nothing better than deconstruction with a backbeat.
6296720	6297720	Yeah.
6297720	6302720	But, you know, you're not alone in liking MC Gun Control.
6302720	6303720	I like them, too.
6303720	6304720	Yeah.
6304720	6307720	I want them back as well, but I never know...
6307720	6309720	I don't want to hear about the name change.
6309720	6310720	We like where it stands.
6310720	6311720	Yeah.
6311720	6316720	Well, I was thinking about, can you cut the beat so I can just talk one-on-one with my
6316720	6317720	friend here?
6317720	6318720	Yeah.
6318720	6323720	I was thinking about changing my name to MC Gun Awareness.
6323720	6325720	It doesn't really flow.
6325720	6326720	I know.
6326720	6329720	It's like hindsight's 20-20 comedically, but I feel like the bit...
6329720	6336720	If it wasn't improvised, I would have written the bit as MC Gun Awareness.
6336720	6341720	So that's more like the, it's pat of gun control.
6341720	6344720	The explanation doesn't seem sincere with the effect.
6344720	6345720	Yeah, I know.
6345720	6348720	Humor should come from an organic place and...
6348720	6353720	I shouldn't question it, but I have a part of me, maybe it's the part of me that loves
6353720	6354720	guns.
6354720	6355720	Yeah!
6355720	6359720	I have a part of me that wants to perfect my bits, you know?
6359720	6366720	If I'm a part of a bit, I want it to be comedically pristine, geometric, golden ratio.
6366720	6368720	Oh, I get it.
6368720	6370720	I see where the irony pivot is.
6370720	6372720	Oh, you can't tell.
6372720	6373720	MC Gun Awareness.
6373720	6374720	I get it.
6374720	6375720	What does he want?
6375720	6378720	He wants us to be aware of guns.
6378720	6379720	Why?
6379720	6384720	But, you know, I'm not supposed to, you know, Kiss isn't supposed to get the joke.
6384720	6385720	Because they say.
6385720	6389720	What did they say about Kiss?
6389720	6394720	That was actually an old anecdote, Rob, when I started using this guy, Stuart Kornfeld,
6394720	6396720	that works for Ben Stiller.
6396720	6399720	He worked for Cronenberg before that.
6399720	6405720	He had this anecdote that back in the 90s when we were still discovering things like
6405720	6410720	being John Malkovich was being written and we were doing our Ron Silverbitt in Heat Vision
6410720	6415720	and Jack, like, Meadow was still being constructed.
6415720	6422720	And so there were often a lot of conversations with producers about, like, are you saying
6422720	6424720	it's bad on purpose?
6424720	6425720	Are we going to...
6425720	6426720	Yeah.
6426720	6427720	And there were a lot of these conversations.
6428720	6431720	And then, like, you're talking about tone a lot with, like, meta comedy.
6431720	6435720	And then Stuart Kornfeld would say, Kiss doesn't get the joke.
6435720	6441720	He had an anecdote about Gene Simmons, like, looking at a reunion poster that someone had
6441720	6445720	drawn up for a Kiss, like, reunion show in the 90s.
6445720	6448720	And it was, like, kind of like...
6448720	6452720	Whatever the graphic designer had, like, gone, like, full bore with it.
6452720	6456720	And I guess it, like, maybe made it, like, funny?
6456720	6457720	I don't know.
6457720	6458720	Like, yeah.
6458720	6463720	It doesn't really matter what they did, but Gene Simmons' response was, no, man, Kiss
6463720	6464720	doesn't get the joke.
6464720	6472720	And I was like, ah, now we have a shorthand for, no, Jack Black shouldn't be, like, winking
6472720	6475720	at the camera when he should be...
6475720	6477720	He should believe that he's...
6477720	6480720	He should be acting his heart out in this, like, silly thing.
6480720	6481720	Like, he should try.
6481720	6487720	Another story that adds to the legend of the genius of Gene Simmons, huh?
6487720	6488720	I know.
6488720	6489720	It's like, you don't want...
6489720	6491720	Do you ever hear that Terry Gross interview with him?
6491720	6492720	Oh, I want to.
6492720	6494720	It's the most uncomfortable fucking shit.
6494720	6496720	If you want to be...
6496720	6498720	Take your poison.
6498720	6500720	Put two of these bullets in a revolver.
6500720	6505720	Like, either the Gary Shandling, Ricky Gervais interview that we talked a little bit about.
6505720	6506720	That is the greatest thing.
6506720	6511720	Or the Gene Simmons, Terry Gross, fucking incredible.
6511720	6513720	Like, that guy, wow.
6513720	6515720	That's all I can think of now.
6515720	6516720	That guy needs a gun.
6516720	6518720	Yeah!
6518720	6520720	Like I need a hole in the head.
6520720	6527720	America needs a gun like it needs a hole in the head.
6527720	6533720	The only thing that stops a hole in the head is a good person with a hole in their head.
6534720	6538720	The only person that stops a bad person...
6538720	6549720	The only way to fill up the hole in the head of a good person is with this equally sized chunk from the head of a bad person whose head had a hole blown in it by a good person.
6549720	6554720	Hopefully the same good person so that the shit doesn't chain-react outward.
6554720	6560720	We don't get what's called a good-bad China syndrome of weapon efficacy.
6560720	6564720	I love that word.
6564720	6566720	Efficacy.
6566720	6568720	Efficacy.
6568720	6570720	Efficacy.
6570720	6572720	Efficacy.
6572720	6575720	All right.
6575720	6580720	Be aware of guns.
6580720	6584720	They're devastating weapons.
6584720	6588720	They can kill so many people.
6588720	6592720	M.C. gun.
6592720	6594720	Awareness.
6594720	6596720	No!
6596720	6598720	M.C. gun control.
6598720	6601720	How can M.C. gun control ever be...
6601720	6605720	Why would he name himself that if he loved guns?
6605720	6607720	Maybe he spells control with a K.
6607720	6609720	Oh, with a K and like a trigger.
6609720	6611720	Okay.
6611720	6613720	All right.
6613720	6614720	Thank you.
6614720	6617720	Thank you.
6617720	6619720	Hey, did you drop out of 11th grade?
6619720	6622720	I like you.
6622720	6625720	Yeah.
6625720	6632720	M.C. gun control is rising up.
6632720	6639720	This is the end of my gun show.
6639720	6645720	M.C. gun control.
6645720	6660720	You've got to rock and roll with guns or their control.
6660720	6663720	It's not quite auto-tuned.
6663720	6667720	We couldn't afford that.
6667720	6671720	But it's a different voice.
6671720	6674720	And it sounds neat.
6674720	6678720	M.C. gun control.
6678720	6684720	Get up on your feet to the beat of gun control.
6684720	6688720	Ground, ground control to M.C. gun control.
6688720	6694720	All gun control.
6694720	6699720	I'm very pleased with myself, man.
6699720	6703720	Guns are dangerous.
6703720	6709720	You could wipe out a lot of people with them.
6709720	6711720	Tonight's night.
6711720	6713720	Control.
6713720	6715720	Everything's going to be all right.
6715720	6718720	Gun control.
6718720	6722720	How many people like semen are in the house?
6722720	6724720	M.C. gun control.
6724720	6728720	It's me, your father, John Control.
6729720	6732720	Come home and mow the lawn.
6732720	6735720	I don't want to.
6735720	6737720	You're grounded.
6737720	6740720	No.
6740720	6744720	I hate regulation.
6744720	6746720	Unilaterally?
6746720	6750720	No, don't pin me down.
6750720	6754720	Just get home and mow the lawn.
6754720	6757720	I'm not going to ask you twice.
6757720	6764720	I'm going to fuck you up with my fist real nice.
6769720	6774720	Dad, you wasted the beat dropping so bad.
6774720	6780720	That was the least worthy performance of a breakdown ever.
6780720	6782720	Fuck you.

6796720	6798720	What?
6798720	6801720	Very abrupt.
6801720	6808720	I love you too, son.
6808720	6814720	It made me cry when that voting accident
6814720	6818720	claimed the life of your brother.

6820720	6822720	I tried to kill myself.
6822720	6824720	Don't do it.
6824720	6827720	M.C. gun control.
6827720	6831720	Has no self control.
6831720	6834720	I got you, start to go.
6834720	6837720	Just start a blog.
6837720	6842720	Okay.
