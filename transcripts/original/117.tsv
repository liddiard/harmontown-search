0	22360	I am guest comptroller Alex Rubens and please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmentown,
22360	25360	Mr. Dan Harmon.
25360	38200	Thank you to the kind people that wrote, performed, and legally represent that music
38200	41760	you were playing.
41760	42760	Give us a week.
42760	46400	Give us a pass for one week where we've got to figure this stuff out.
46400	49360	No one's making any money on this tonight.
49360	55000	Just a dry run of our video podcasting ability.
55000	59960	People are watching this hello to you, live streaming wherever you are.
59960	63840	I saw somebody who said they were getting up at three in the morning in Ireland to watch.
63840	66080	I think him and like 500 other people are watching.
66080	68880	So we've doubled our audience.
68880	76040	Yeah, we're just seeing what it takes.
76040	77040	Where's the red light?
77040	79040	There it is.
79040	83560	I'm not going to let this affect me.
83560	90520	But I am standing like a good eight to 12 inches back because that camera gives us a
90520	92840	great shot of your handsome face.
92840	95520	So wait, that red light is telling us where the...
95520	96520	Yep.
96520	97520	It's pretty fancy, huh?
97520	98520	Yeah, yeah.
98520	99520	It's crazy.
99520	101640	I paid for all this shit.
101640	103920	That's what I do.
103920	107200	I take my money and I turn it into more for them.
107200	108200	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
108360	110920	I put it into the budget for community.
110920	111920	Robin Hood.
117920	118920	All right.
118920	122120	Let's not ruin their night because of this.
122120	127000	So I'm staying at the Hilton for a week.
127000	131160	That's why I'm wearing a shirt that says Los Angeles on it.
131160	134680	Because I haven't been home to grab some clothes yet.
134680	137000	Having a little bit of a premarital.
137000	141200	Robin and I are taking a...it's a tradition in our American culture.
141200	149320	We're taking a week-long honeymoon away from each other before we get married because things
149320	152120	are scary right now.
152120	154640	We're having dramatic times.
154640	161960	And I can only report on my emotional part of it, which is that, yeah, I'm in a hotel.
161960	165480	I'm playing a lot of Minecraft.
165480	169840	I actually burnt out my laptop's charger today.
169840	174240	There was a point where I had to leave the hotel room because the...not the computer
174240	178560	but the thing that powers the computer that has to be plugged in the whole time because
178560	182080	if you're playing Minecraft, the battery lasts 10 seconds.
182080	185840	So the charger has to be plugged in the whole time and it gets as hot as a frying pan and
185840	189520	then at a certain point I think it just shuts down so it doesn't cause a fire.
189520	190720	That square white plastic thing?
190720	194560	Yeah, the square white plastic brick.
194560	198760	So that thing eventually has like...it can only go three straight days before it just
198760	205880	like...because I don't know what you're doing but you're not the president so stop it.
205880	208040	Hire someone to do whatever else needs to be done.
208040	209440	I'm just an Apple device.
209440	213520	I'm the best of the best but I can't handle it no more.
213520	216760	See I lost my grammar circuit.
216760	220360	That's the laptop still talking.
220360	223960	So I went to the Universal City Walk because I'm at the Hilton over by the Universal City
223960	224960	Walk.
224960	228340	Then I went to walk over there.
228340	234120	So all of my stories are from the walk from a hotel room to an elevator to the Universal
234120	237680	City Walk and very quickly back.
237680	243840	First of all, elevators on the top floor of the Hilton or an upper floor to the point
243840	245640	where I had to wait a very long time for the elevator.
245640	247960	This story gets much better in a second.
247960	250160	I like it so far.
250160	255000	It took a noteworthy amount of time for the elevator to come.
255000	260800	I thought maybe there's a problem or it must be less like...I don't know what hotel peak
260800	261800	hours are.
261800	263200	It was 10 a.m.
263200	267200	Maybe that's peak elevator coming and going time probably is.
267200	268200	Families on vacation.
268200	271160	By the way, and we'll get to this in a second, I don't know who these people are that come
271160	275480	to LA to be where I was.
275480	277600	I don't know.
277600	286080	If you live in Seattle or Florida and you're coming to California, go to Disneyland.
286080	288200	Why are you at the Universal...
288200	291680	I think Universal City Walk is something people have heard of and I think sometimes that's
291680	292680	all it is.
292680	294640	Well, yeah, because Universal tells you about it.
294640	297840	They have a lot of money to tell you about it, but they also have a lot of money to tell
297840	299840	you about Despicable B4.
299840	303480	That's how they make their money is telling you shit, but you don't have to believe them
303480	305120	all the time.
305120	306120	They're not Disneyland.
306120	308400	That is a shitty theme park.
308400	314600	I think, come on, you've got to agree with me, Backdraft?
314600	315600	The experience?
315600	316600	You feel the heat.
316600	321640	I mean, they know what they're doing.
321640	327400	They know that it is a place you go, I guess, if you're afraid of Disneyland.
327400	328400	Yeah.
328400	332720	Well, the thing I like about it is the people who are your hosts are clearly, at least the
332720	335440	times that I've been, are pretty tired.
335440	341480	So when they're doing the whole bit, the people who are driving the trams, but they're probably
341480	342480	not driving the trams.
342480	348200	Well, the people who are talking to you who are like, oh, and here we are at this subway
348200	349200	station.
349200	350200	Uh-oh.
350200	351200	What's this?
351200	352960	And they're just doing it that energetically?
352960	356520	Well, unless, because they've done it so many times that day.
356520	357520	Uh-oh.
357520	358520	Yeah.
359400	363360	The dinosaurs have escaped from their pens.
363360	368400	But then again, I guess you expected that because it's the Jurassic Park ride.
368400	372000	It's based in a movie about something going wrong.
372000	376720	Michael Crichton was very inspired by theme parks when he wrote his books, Westworld and
376720	382320	Jurassic Park, which are basically the same story, but with cowboys and dinosaurs.
383320	390080	Anyways, as Michael Crichton often predicts in his narrative, something's gone wrong.
390080	397280	Which either suggests that nothing's going wrong because something's supposed to go wrong.
397280	400000	Or that you were about to be cheated earlier.
400000	401000	Right, exactly.
401000	403200	You were about to see a very boring dinosaur ride.
403200	407280	Normally, we just go around on the tracks and you don't see any dinosaurs, but you're
407280	408280	safe.
408280	409280	Did you ever hear the urban legend?
409280	410320	Rob Schrab told me this.
410320	414320	So, sue away.
414320	418200	You in Ireland.
418200	422960	Raph told me that he heard this story that when they first opened the Jurassic Park
422960	431120	ride, it ends, spoilers, with a T-Rex trying to eat you.
431120	438240	And it can't because you're on a ride.
438240	439240	But it tries.
439240	440240	The illusion is that it tries.
441160	442160	And that's what you paid for.
442160	444160	I don't have to explain this to you.
444160	445160	No, they get it.
445160	446160	Yeah, they understand.
446160	447160	You're on a raft.
447160	451240	And the ride starts with, like, welcome to regular, normal dinosaur park.
451240	452240	Oh, my God.
452240	453240	Something's gone wrong, et cetera.
453240	456880	Okay, we'll get you through this as quick as we can.
456880	457880	And then they get you through it.
457880	462520	And at the end, of course, there's going to be a, you know, a water slide at the end.
462520	465040	But right before it, a T-Rex, like, tries his best.
465040	469160	Like, he's like, I'm going to still eat you.
469160	471040	He's like a midwestern 10-year-old dinosaur.
471040	472320	I'm going to still eat you.
472320	476360	It was weird that they weren't more faithful to the movie.
476360	479000	I thought it was a strange choice to have.
479000	480000	I didn't have any bischetti.
480000	483920	I'm going to supposed to eat you.
483920	484920	It's a very lovable dinosaur.
484920	490240	You just sort of pick him up and take him to the zoo because he'd be like, what the,
490240	492440	this is more boring than, like, normal life.
492440	497560	All right, the, so apparently, and I don't know if this is true because I think you would
497560	503560	have heard more about it, but apparently on the initial kind of maiden voyage or ride,
503560	511720	an actual dinosaur tourists are in the raft kind of in a sense, if the story is true,
511720	520000	the T-Rex, the hydraulic T-Rex malfunctioned in real life.
520000	525720	And it kind of like, like Rob described it as the dinosaur going, like, it's like, you
525720	530840	go in the raft and the person goes, oh, shit, look out, we're going to have to, he didn't
530840	531840	say that.
531840	532840	That's not the part that went wrong.
532840	533840	He's like, oh, no, look out.
533840	543280	We're going to have to go really fast and get past those T-Rex and the T-Rex went, alright.
543280	551360	And scalding hot hydraulic fluid sprayed the people as they were then thrust down a
551360	553680	water slide and their picture was taken.
553680	560840	For real, more horrible than anything.
560840	565160	And Michael Creighton's ghost was like, first of all, I'm not dead.
565160	568840	Second of all, meta, like, holy shit.
568840	571160	And he's like, I got an idea for a third book.
572080	574160	Well, he does have a time traveling ghost, doesn't he?
574160	575160	Isn't that part of his check?
575160	580800	I'm sure he wrote a book about a place you go where time traveling ghosts are not supposed
580800	584480	to do anything wrong to you.
584480	592800	And then on page 25, I have a feeling that the ghosts start not time traveling right.
592800	597440	I believe that story about the hydraulic hot acid spraying Tyrannosaurus.
597440	598440	Yeah.
598440	599440	I mean, I don't know.
599560	603200	I feel like maybe the theme parks are pretty good at not sharing.
603200	606320	Maybe I'm a conspiracy theorist, but I kind of feel like those aren't front page headlines
606320	607640	if nobody gets killed.
607640	608640	Yeah.
608640	611600	But then every once in a while somebody does in fact get killed.
611600	612600	Yes, that's true.
612600	615280	And that's still not front page headlines, I guess.
615280	618200	You also can't find out, Spencer tuned me into this.
618200	619760	You can't find out for the life of you.
619760	623360	I don't care what book you're writing or what industry you represent.
623360	626000	You can't get a statistic about cop killings.
626000	628200	I mean, cops killing people.
628640	629640	Oh, right.
629640	631480	That you can't find out.
631480	635360	You can't just like, how many times have cops killed people?
635360	636360	Can't Google it.
636360	637360	Yeah.
637360	638360	Where does it happen the most?
638360	639360	How often?
639360	640360	How many times a day?
640360	641360	Did I tell you this that I was writing a sketch?
641360	648120	I also, I write for community and Rick and Morty.
648120	649520	Please your guest comptroller, Alex Rubens.
649520	650520	I'm so sorry.
650520	651520	I introduce myself.
651520	652520	My manners.
652520	653520	No, no, no.
653520	654520	I don't know what I'm doing.
654520	655520	No, so nice.
655520	656520	I'm a wreck.
656520	657520	No, I'm in the middle of a theme.
657840	659440	I'm living in a hotel.
659440	664040	I bought a sweatshirt that says Los Angeles on it.
664040	665920	You look pretty put together, though.
665920	667200	The shirt's actually funnier.
667200	668200	The shirt says...
675200	678200	I'll punish that.
682200	683200	Yeah.
688520	689520	Yeah.
689520	691520	You want to zoom in on my shoulders in Ireland?
691520	692520	Yeah.
692520	693520	My God.
693520	695520	Making use of the technology.
695520	698520	It looks like the Battle of Galway.
698520	699520	Why am I Scottish?
699520	701520	There was no Battle of Galway.
701520	703520	The shirt says...
708520	711520	The shirt says, I believe, I can't read upside down,
711520	715520	Hollywood, an American tradition.
716520	719520	Never in the history of powerful words
719520	723520	have a bunch of words been used that mean so little.
723520	727520	Hollywood, an American tradition.
727520	730520	Yeah, I guess it is.
730520	732520	I guess it is in America.
732520	735520	There's nothing Soviet about Hollywood.
735520	738520	Nothing Chinese about it.
738520	740520	Yeah, it really is.
740520	744520	It's as old as apple pie and the country it exists in.
744520	746520	Oh, yeah.
746520	748520	It's almost not worth mentioning.
748520	750520	That's for sure.
750520	752520	Do you think they mean...
752520	754520	What's the word?
754520	757520	You guys know synecdoche and metonymy?
757520	759520	This idea...
759520	762520	You're going to let it all hang out for the rest of the...
762520	765520	What do you want to talk about?
765520	768520	Let's talk about synecdoche while Dan is naked.
768520	772520	No, not synecdoche, New York,
772520	774520	which is a pun on synecdoche, New York,
774520	776520	but the actual word...
776520	779520	I used to be an English teacher, so I can make this very boring.
779520	782520	No, but this idea that when you say the White House,
782520	784520	sometimes you're not talking about the place itself.
784520	788520	You mean presidential power, the executive branch.
788520	790520	And sometimes when people say Hollywood,
790520	793520	they're talking about the film business.
793520	795520	So do you think that they mean...
795520	797520	The film business?
797520	800520	No, I think they're just like, please...
800520	804520	You came here, like, did you bring money?
804520	806520	It just seems weird.
806520	808520	Because I went to Universal City Walk,
808520	811520	which does not sell laptop chargers.
811520	813520	Which it should have occurred to me
813520	816520	that it's not something that you would ever buy
816520	818520	on your way to a theme park or from it.
818520	820520	So why would I want to find...
820520	822520	They just have Dippin' Dots, basically.
822520	826520	Dippin' Dots and a sock store called the LA Sock Exchange.
826520	828520	Oh, my God.
828520	831520	Because it's the craziest sock store in the world.
831520	833520	Do you think the name of the store came first
833520	835520	before they had the idea to have a sock store?
835520	838520	I think the name of capitalism.
838520	844520	The weird thing is you see people on the Universal City Walk...
844520	847520	It happened like eight times before I was like,
847520	849520	okay, this is a thing.
849520	851520	People just stop and take a picture.
851520	854520	But they're taking a picture of a row of neon signs
854520	859520	that say Bubba Gump and Abercrombie and Fitch
859520	862520	and Radio Shack or whatever.
862520	866520	And then an ad for Box Trolls 3 or something.
866520	868520	And there was all this security there
868520	870520	because of some movie called Box Trolls
870520	872520	and I was really offended.
872520	874520	I was like, don't try to keep me out of Box Trolls.
874520	876520	I don't even know what the fuck...
876520	878520	Is Tom Hanks in it?
878520	880520	What the fuck are you...
880520	883520	There's nine people here who could all be saving lives somewhere.
883520	885520	What were they trying to get in your Box Trolls?
885520	887520	Your Box Trolls what?
887520	889520	I don't know, man.
889520	891520	It's a movie about some Box Trolls motherfucker.
891520	893520	I don't give a fuck, man.
893520	896520	I did hear that there's a lot of crime at the Universal City Walk.
896520	898520	I might be making that up.
898520	899520	No, I've heard that.
899520	901520	That's what's really sad about it.
901520	905520	The idea that gang activity happens at these shitty...
905520	909520	I always thought gangs had secret places they could go,
909520	911520	like pool halls or something.
911520	913520	No, they have to go to ice cream shops.
913520	915520	Right.
915520	918520	Like just bad movie theaters.
918520	920520	I guess if I imagine being in a gang,
920520	922520	and this is probably not at all with it,
922520	924520	I'm sure that I'm wrong about what it's like to be in a gang.
924520	926520	The one thing I know for sure is that I'm wrong.
926520	929520	But I feel like if I wanted to...
929520	931520	It's probably really offensive.
931520	933520	If I wanted to make trouble.
933520	935520	Right.
935520	938520	Which is how people like me see gangs.
938520	940520	So it must be how they see themselves.
940520	942520	I mean, if I wanted to fuck shit up,
942520	944520	I might go to Universal City Walk.
944520	947520	Well, I think what happens is that they're taking the day off from being a gang.
947520	949520	Oh, they're just...
949520	953520	That's why fights happen, because then they run into another gang,
953520	957520	and they're like, you come to Knott's Berry Farm?
957520	961520	Vato?
961520	966520	It's a guilty pleasure for me and my essays.
966520	968520	We're human beings.
968520	970520	If you prick us, do we not bleed?
970520	972520	We like cotton candy.
972520	973520	Now I have to shoot you.
973520	975520	You saw me at Knott's Berry Farm.
975520	977520	And you're in a different gang.
977520	978520	This is not...
978520	981520	I would, and this is why we're not in gangs,
981520	983520	I think we would go, you come to Knott's Berry...
983520	986520	All right, let's just hang out together.
986520	990520	But they know, there's something more pressing about gang business for them.
990520	993520	Well, the second somebody made any threatening gesture toward me,
993520	994520	I'd be like, I quit the gang.
994520	997520	Like, I'm sorry that I'm in the wrong gang.
997520	998520	I wouldn't...
998520	1003520	You'd be the guy who wears all the colors.
1003520	1007520	They tell you, you need a red bandana or a red thing on your shoe,
1007520	1008520	and you're like, all of them be above.
1008520	1011520	You'd be like this red guy.
1011520	1017520	You'd look like some shitty improv troupe off the strip in Las Vegas,
1017520	1020520	trying to bite on Blue Man Group shit.
1020520	1022520	That's some kind of color gimmick.
1022520	1026520	And then somebody would go, hey, man, I'm going to fuck you up.
1026520	1030520	And then you'd go to your gang leader and go, something happened today.
1030520	1031520	I'm out.
1031520	1032520	Or I'd be...
1032520	1034520	I was at the circus once, and I saw this guy who...
1034520	1035520	It was a woman, actually.
1035520	1037520	She did this amazing trick that I still...
1037520	1038520	It was explained to me, and I still don't understand it.
1038520	1040520	That's my favorite stuff with the magic,
1040520	1042520	when even though you know it's a trick and it's not what it looks like,
1042520	1043520	you still...
1043520	1045520	I physically do not understand how that's possible.
1045520	1048520	But this woman had a hula hoop,
1048520	1050520	and she just passed it over herself,
1050520	1052520	and she was wearing different clothes.
1052520	1054520	That's not gang...
1054520	1055520	Well...
1055520	1056520	...related.
1056520	1057520	They wear it.
1057520	1059520	They wear it different colors.
1059520	1063520	Well, I was thinking that's probably what I would do if I were...
1063520	1064520	You would do that.
1064520	1066520	I'd just pass a hula hoop over myself.
1066520	1067520	You would just Zellig to whatever...
1067520	1068520	Whatever gang...
1068520	1070520	Yeah, I would also...
1070520	1072520	Here's a couple other things I would do.
1072520	1073520	In a war?
1073520	1076520	I would definitely, because I do it all the time in my dreams,
1076520	1078520	when I'm accidentally in a war in my dreams,
1078520	1080520	I would play dead.
1080520	1081520	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1081520	1084520	And I'm surprised there's not more stories about that.
1084520	1087520	I actually talked to a veteran that was in the Korean War,
1087520	1089520	and I don't know...
1089520	1092520	He was there as part of a vet conference or something.
1092520	1093520	I ran into him at a hotel.
1093520	1095520	This was years ago, but I was like,
1095520	1098520	man, my family's riddled with vets,
1098520	1101520	and I have all this guilt about being a fucking doughy piece of shit,
1101520	1104520	fucking their legacy.
1105520	1110520	I bayoneted a million people for you while a voiceover played.
1110520	1112520	And they fought for your freedom.
1112520	1115520	Yeah, and I'm like, okay, then I'll be in comedy sports.
1115520	1117520	Well, that's what they fought for.
1117520	1118520	No, that's what they fought for.
1118520	1120520	That's why I hate myself.
1120520	1123520	I should at least open a Dippin' Dots or something.
1123520	1126520	Something that feels, I don't know, like something.
1126520	1129520	I don't know, like a bayonet store.
1129520	1130520	This one's for you, grandpa.
1130520	1133520	I'm hyper-aware of the decline of my generation.
1134520	1136520	I mean, they shouldn't have shaken all those canes.
1136520	1138520	It got to me.
1141520	1143520	He told me a story.
1143520	1146520	He's a vet, and he can say this.
1146520	1151520	He was telling this story about how he played dead.
1151520	1152520	He did.
1152520	1154520	It was a terrible situation.
1154520	1156520	All his friends were dying,
1156520	1160520	and he just thought like a child, I'll just lay still.
1160520	1162520	And he did, and he did it for a really long time.
1162520	1165520	And he says, you know, war stories are sometimes,
1165520	1167520	they're the only truth that we have,
1167520	1169520	and sometimes they're very apocryphal.
1169520	1173520	But he says that at a certain point during him playing dead,
1173520	1176520	an enemy soldier who took their territory
1176520	1179520	because they all got killed or in his case played dead,
1179520	1183520	like at a certain point they mounted a,
1183520	1188520	you know, they rested a tripod on his chest
1188520	1191520	to gun for a machine gun.
1191520	1194520	And he just laid there and used his body.
1194520	1195520	Wow.
1195520	1197520	Yeah, I don't know why you would make that story up.
1197520	1198520	Yeah, that's true.
1198520	1200520	I mean, like you would if you were like 10
1200520	1201520	and you had never been in a war.
1201520	1202520	You'd be like, what if?
1202520	1204520	And then what if?
1204520	1207520	But he had the little hat and the medals,
1207520	1209520	and he was bummed out about it.
1209520	1212520	So it felt like real, real.
1212520	1214520	He wasn't like, high five, right?
1214520	1218520	And he was like, yeah, there's a story for you.
1218520	1220520	And I was like, that makes me feel better.
1220520	1224520	I feel a lot like I would definitely let my country down.
1224520	1225520	Well, I feel like outside of movies,
1225520	1228520	probably for the most part a single soldier
1228520	1230520	isn't changing the tide of a battle, right?
1230520	1231520	You're mostly getting killed.
1231520	1233520	You know, that's stinking thinking.
1233520	1235520	Oh, well, yeah.
1235520	1237520	No, that's the terrifying thing.
1237520	1239520	Saving Private Ryan and the fucking opens up
1239520	1240520	and it's just like those gates come down
1240520	1242520	and it's just blah, blah, blah, blah.
1242520	1243520	And they're like, wow, that's, yeah,
1243520	1247520	that's probably a tenth of how chaotic, boy.
1247520	1250520	And I feel nervous controlling Armandones.
1250520	1251520	Yeah.
1251520	1252520	How will we get through this?
1252520	1259520	So why are we on that?
1259520	1261520	It's part of your job is to keep me off tangents.
1261520	1264520	Oh, yeah, well, we were talking about Universal City Walk
1264520	1267520	and looking for the, well, the tumult in your life.
1267520	1268520	Right.
1268520	1269520	And gangs.
1269520	1270520	Gangs.
1270520	1271520	But I feel gangs came off the universe.
1271520	1272520	Oh, gangs, okay, yeah.
1272520	1273520	Be a bad gang.
1273520	1274520	Yeah, the guy would say, yeah, okay, we're done with that.
1274520	1276520	Yeah, I'd be a terrible gang.
1276520	1279520	You know, that's why they do a really smart thing with gangs,
1279520	1281520	apparently, I saw on the PBS.
1281520	1282520	Yeah.
1282520	1285520	They beat you up going into the gang.
1285520	1286520	They're like, welcome to the gang.
1286520	1287520	We beat you up.
1287520	1288520	Right.
1288520	1289520	So then you're like, okay, I know how that feels.
1289520	1291520	Oh, so you're not afraid of.
1291520	1292520	So maybe I'll be a little, you know,
1292520	1295520	maybe I'll get through that first one with the enemy gang.
1295520	1296520	Right, right, right.
1296520	1298520	Because Ralph beat me up.
1298520	1300520	And he loves me.
1300520	1301520	Yeah.
1301520	1303520	Do you think they really, like, they really fucking beat you up?
1303520	1305520	I bet they fucking go crazy on you.
1305520	1306520	Yeah, for sure.
1306520	1308520	How, I mean, okay.
1308520	1310520	The streets are, the streets are all they have.
1310520	1311520	I don't think you get this.
1311520	1313520	No, I, yeah.
1313520	1314520	I'm like the opposite.
1314520	1318520	I'm like such a, I'm ashamed of how not in a gang I am.
1318520	1320520	I've got, I'm like a, just a.
1320520	1322520	I'm like 3% more in a gang than you.
1322520	1323520	I think you might be, yeah.
1323520	1326520	Just by not showering.
1326520	1328520	Because I'm like, I don't care if I stink.
1328520	1329520	Yeah.
1329520	1330520	That's, that's a.
1330520	1331520	Yeah.
1331520	1334520	I am, I am deeply, I realized this a while ago,
1334520	1337520	that every time I imagine somebody is holding a gun to my head,
1337520	1339520	or a tiger is approaching me,
1339520	1342520	or I look into the sky and there's a nuclear bomb falling down,
1342520	1345520	I, my first thought is like, time to check out.
1345520	1346520	Like, I'm, I'm out.
1346520	1348520	Like, I would rather, you know, flip,
1348520	1351520	if I had a button that says kill Alex, I would just push it.
1351520	1352520	Right.
1352520	1353520	Because, and then I was like, I feel like that's,
1353520	1356520	that's the ultimate cowardice in a way.
1356520	1357520	I mean, I don't mean that suicide is,
1357520	1363520	I mean that, that my impulse to avoid terror is a fault.
1363520	1364520	You know?
1364520	1365520	Yeah.
1365520	1366520	Not that, I don't know.
1366520	1369520	I mean, I'm not making a case for wrestling a tiger.
1369520	1376520	But maybe your cowardice in the face of these overwhelming things is,
1376520	1379520	like you saying, I don't want to be in that situation.
1379520	1380520	Yeah.
1380520	1383520	Because the scariest thing in the world is letting myself or my fellow man
1383520	1384520	down.
1384520	1385520	So I would rather, like you said,
1385520	1388520	you'd rather hit a button and explode.
1388520	1391520	If a crocodile got too close.
1391520	1392520	Yeah.
1392520	1396520	Because you don't want to go out going, get this crocodile off of me.
1396520	1400520	So maybe you are like manlier in a sense.
1400520	1401520	What's a nice way of thinking about it?
1401520	1402520	Or at least less crocodilian.
1402520	1405520	Well, I think, you know, I think, I think it's like,
1405520	1407520	I think it's as I like with dreams.
1407520	1410520	I think that these ridiculous scenarios that occasionally pop into my head
1410520	1412520	are like metaphors for regular life.
1412520	1415520	And that like, I'm afraid of hardship.
1415520	1416520	Can I tell you something?
1416520	1418520	I confess this to you at dinner, but I'm,
1418520	1419520	and I'm so deeply ashamed of it.
1419520	1420520	I feel like I have to tell them.
1420520	1422520	I don't remember you saying anything shameful.
1422520	1424520	Yeah, you do.
1424520	1426520	You blocked it out.
1426520	1429520	You, you categorized it as talking about movies because technically it is.
1429520	1432520	But the truth is at the end of aliens,
1432520	1434520	when Ripley goes back for nude,
1434520	1436520	I would not do that.
1436520	1437520	Yeah.
1437520	1439520	Every time I watch aliens and Ripley's like,
1439520	1441520	the car shows up and they're like,
1441520	1444520	all right, we made it through aliens.
1444520	1446520	It was even harder than alien.
1446520	1449520	You're, you're, you're alive.
1449520	1451520	A bunch of us are alive.
1451520	1453520	The robot's alive.
1453520	1454520	The kid's gone.
1454520	1455520	Yeah.
1455520	1457520	It's a bummer about nude.
1457520	1459520	But I mean, she's gone.
1459520	1464520	I mean, she was taken by multiple aliens.
1464520	1465520	Yeah.
1465520	1470520	Aliens with acid for blood and for spit.
1470520	1475520	With, with second mouths designed for punching you while biting you.
1475520	1479520	Tails that are like, that can cut a car in half.
1479520	1481520	Armor for skin.
1481520	1483520	No eyes.
1483520	1487520	Giger-designed spinal cord bodies.
1487520	1493520	A mysterious backstory that transgresses the cosmos.
1493520	1494520	Transgresses?
1494520	1495520	Yeah.
1495520	1496520	I mean, I'm sticking with it.
1496520	1497520	Yeah, stick with it, yeah.
1497520	1498520	It does.
1498520	1502520	It transgresses the cosmos.
1502520	1507520	I'm going to say heartbeat or not based on what I've seen in all my alien
1507520	1509520	adventures, I'm not going back.
1509520	1510520	Yeah.
1510520	1511520	I don't think that's shameful.
1511520	1512520	I would say this.
1512520	1513520	I think I wouldn't go back either.
1513520	1514520	I wouldn't.
1514520	1515520	I wouldn't go back either.
1515520	1520520	But, but, and I, and I kind of believe that anyone who isn't a parent and even
1520520	1523520	them, those people are probably lying.
1523520	1526520	If they say they would go back, like, I mean, like there's a, there's a point at
1526520	1528520	which parents just become liars by default.
1528520	1531520	Like they, I've talked to all of them and they,
1531520	1534520	they, they, they go like, yeah, you can't be a parent and tell the truth
1534520	1537520	anymore because the biological truth is sometimes you want to strangle your
1537520	1538520	child.
1538520	1540520	Otherwise you're not a real parent.
1540520	1543520	Like if you don't, sometimes it won't be like, I'm sorry you were born.
1543520	1544520	I want to murder you right now.
1544520	1545520	Yeah.
1545520	1547520	You can't say that out loud because some people do and it's like always a
1547520	1548520	bummer.
1548520	1549520	Yeah.
1549520	1553520	But, but, but, and I'm saying like, it's good.
1553520	1557520	Like that is the good, when you become a parent, you turn in your honesty as the
1557520	1559520	best policy card.
1559520	1563520	Like from now on, honesty is not the best policy because honestly you might
1563520	1564520	murder your child.
1564520	1568520	I mean, I do think like I, if I imagine, I can't imagine what it's like and I
1568520	1573520	part of me wants to believe that if you have a kid, like it suddenly it is a
1573520	1574520	different situation.
1574520	1575520	No, it does.
1575520	1576520	They say that too.
1576520	1577520	They love the kids.
1577520	1578520	They love them.
1578520	1579520	Yeah.
1579520	1580520	They don't just want to kill me.
1580520	1582520	But for somebody to be, yeah.
1582520	1584520	Sometimes you want to kill them.
1584520	1589520	But they're, they literally come into this world from inside of us, not, not
1589520	1591520	unlike the alien monster.
1591520	1592520	Right.
1592520	1593520	Right.
1593520	1597520	And when I say we, I mean me personally, I have to go through this and to live
1597520	1598520	with it.
1598520	1602520	It's just like, they're, they're, you know, they're wonderful and we do it for
1602520	1604520	them and they're great.
1604520	1606520	And I'm going to go out on a limb.
1606520	1608520	I think they're the future.
1608520	1609520	Oh yeah.
1609520	1610520	The children are.
1610520	1613520	And I think I, that's why it's amazing about them.
1613520	1614520	Yeah.
1614520	1618520	I think they're going to be less racist and more productive and better with eye
1618520	1619520	devices.
1619520	1623520	And, and it's just going to turn everything right around.
1623520	1628520	I predict the same number of wars and Guantanamo is still open by this time
1628520	1634520	next thousand years, except dogs will be more fucked up because I think they're
1634520	1637520	just like, like dogs will just all limp.
1637520	1640520	Like even golden retrievers, they'll just like, they'll like have no hips.
1640520	1641520	Yeah.
1641520	1642520	Because they're all inbred, right?
1642520	1643520	Yeah.
1643520	1644520	Because we can't stop loving them.
1644520	1645520	We don't talk about that.
1645520	1646520	No, we don't.
1646520	1650520	We are, we are deforming these, uh, these animals for our pleasure.
1650520	1652520	Dan, am I doing an okay job so far?
1652520	1657520	I think you're doing great because no, I wasn't fishing for cause I'm, I'm like
1657520	1661520	sweating and I kind of feel like I'm going to shit my pants a little bit.
1661520	1664520	Oh, go for it.
1664520	1666520	Oh, he wants you to shoot your pants.
1666520	1667520	I'm going to do it.
1667520	1668520	I'm going to do it.
1668520	1669520	You're right.
1669520	1670520	Yeah.
1670520	1671520	Go for that guy.
1671520	1672520	Yeah.
1672520	1674520	The go for it guy.
1674520	1676520	Go for it.
1676520	1680520	In that, in that same vein of the like cowardice of being attacked by a tiger,
1680520	1683520	although almost by definition, it's like, don't even count as cowardice.
1683520	1685520	If you get scared of a tiger is going to eat you.
1685520	1686520	Right.
1686520	1688520	I mean, that's like, but in that same way, half the time, it turns out that's what
1688520	1690520	you're supposed to do in a bear attack.
1690520	1692520	You're supposed to, you're supposed to lay there limp.
1692520	1693520	So the bear stops fucking with you.
1693520	1694520	It goes away.
1694520	1695520	That's like the bravest thing you can do.
1695520	1697520	Have you heard some of the, like, there's, there were like new instructions
1697520	1698520	about bears.
1699520	1703520	It depends on what kind of bear it is and it depends how the bear's acting.
1703520	1707520	But I think the universal thing is if they start eating you, you have to fight.
1707520	1708520	Right.
1708520	1712520	Like if you're lying there playing dead and it starts eating you and then you
1712520	1717520	don't call my bluff, then you don't.
1717520	1718520	Yeah.
1718520	1721520	And then the bear's going to be like, I know, and I don't care.
1721520	1726520	I prefer if you kept playing dead, but I will also enjoy eating you while you
1726520	1727520	scream.
1727520	1728520	There is that thing about animals.
1728520	1732520	Like you can trick them into thinking that they like, I think in that movie
1732520	1734520	fast, cheap and out of control, there's a lion tamer.
1734520	1735520	Have you seen that?
1735520	1736520	Anybody seen that?
1736520	1737520	Yeah.
1737520	1738520	Yeah.
1738520	1739520	But the lion tamer is talking about how like the real way lion taming works.
1739520	1741520	Although I've heard different versions of this is that the lions don't
1741520	1746520	understand that this puny human is puny because he's acting with such
1746520	1750520	confidence and making so much noise that the lions are like, well, this guy
1750520	1752520	must be able to kick my ass.
1752520	1755520	So just like in the same way that like somebody comes up to you with enough
1755520	1758520	confidence and you might be like, Oh, I guess you're in charge.
1758520	1759520	Yeah.
1759520	1763520	And those shitty hypnotists where they're like, I'm going to tell you what
1763520	1764520	I do.
1764520	1765520	And I'm going to explain it to you very confidently.
1765520	1767520	What I do is a technique called mind control.
1767520	1769520	Mind control is something you've experienced.
1769520	1771520	If you've ever been on the freeway, you've experienced what's called
1771520	1773520	highway hypnosis, highway hypnosis.
1773520	1774520	I'm never going to say the word.
1774520	1778520	I'm not going to say the word or I'm never going to exhibit any insecurity
1778520	1779520	sleep.
1782520	1783520	He slept.
1783520	1784520	He did it.
1785520	1794520	I had this Armenian plumber neighbor that I loved and he like won one of
1794520	1795520	those comedy contests.
1795520	1799520	And we went to the ice house in Pasadena because he won a comedy contest,
1799520	1800520	which means they're paper in the house.
1800520	1802520	And it was literally just us.
1802520	1808520	It was just me and my plumber neighbor and his wife and a couple friends in
1808520	1810520	an empty comedy club.
1810520	1812520	And a guy came out and did that routine.
1812520	1817520	And I had seen that guy's act, not him personally, but those hypnosis acts
1817520	1818520	are all kind of the same.
1818520	1826520	And the, I had to go up because nothing, it was like I was so uncomfortable
1826520	1827520	for the guy.
1827520	1830520	Like, so I had to like, I was like, he does the test.
1830520	1832520	I want you to hold your hands above your head.
1832520	1834520	I'm going to tell you right now, you cannot unlock your hands.
1834520	1835520	You're trying very hard.
1835520	1836520	The power of cement.
1836520	1837520	On the count of three, I want you to do it.
1837520	1840520	And I was like, I have to like be one of the guys because he's not going to
1840520	1841520	have anybody.
1841520	1845520	You played along because you didn't want to let him down.
1845520	1850520	Because my friend is a Lebanese-Armedian plumber.
1850520	1852520	Like, he's a no-nonsense guy.
1852520	1854520	He's not hypnotizable.
1854520	1856520	Right, right.
1856520	1861520	He came here because you actually duped him into thinking that he won a contest.
1861520	1864520	I'm the only professional entertainer in the room, except for the hypnotist,
1864520	1866520	who is bombing.
1866520	1872520	So I was like, I can't, what, oh boy.
1872520	1875520	It's like glue up here.
1875520	1877520	And he's like, all right, what's your name?
1877520	1880520	Dan, unless you tell me otherwise.
1880520	1885520	And then I sat, and I was fucking 45 minutes later, me alone on stage,
1885520	1890520	rapping, like singing, pretending I think I'm naked.
1890520	1892520	Oh, oh, I'm naked.
1892520	1893520	Whoa.
1893520	1895520	No, no, no, no, no, you're not naked anymore.
1896520	1900520	My clothes appeared out of nowhere.
1900520	1905520	Just like, just my fear of watching a fucking horrible act.
1905520	1908520	But maybe that's disintegrate in front of my eyes.
1908520	1912520	And I was just like, and for real, it was racist, too, because he was, he said,
1912520	1917520	he was, you know, the hypnotist acts, they're not straight out of the pages
1917520	1919520	of fucking Jezebel, you know.
1919520	1921520	Like, they're, they're like.
1921520	1924520	Oh, I thought you meant cooperating with the hypnotist was racist.
1924520	1926520	And I was trying to figure out how it was.
1926520	1927520	Well, it was.
1927520	1928520	It became racist.
1928520	1932520	Because at one point he said, like, it's kind of an 80s craft, the road hypno guy.
1932520	1935520	You know, he comes to your high school, and this is a thing, you know,
1935520	1938520	the guy's in the suit, and it kind of smells like your grandpa's sleeping bag
1938520	1945520	and your, the, I still cannot get that odor out of my head.
1945520	1948520	So he really protected the country.
1948520	1951520	But also, oh, my God.
1951520	1952520	Uh-oh.
1952520	1954520	No, all right.
1954520	1960520	The, the, he, like, so he, at one point he said, the person I'm talking to right
1960520	1962520	now, the person I'm talking to right now, I have my hand on your shoulder,
1962520	1966520	I'm talking to you right now, when I say the word go, you are going to realize
1966520	1970520	that you are a world class rap artist.
1970520	1971520	A world class rap artist.
1971520	1973520	You are a world class rap artist.
1973520	1975520	You are a rapper.
1975520	1977520	However, you are a Chinese.
1977520	1979520	You are a Chinese person.
1979520	1980520	That's what he did.
1980520	1982520	So it's like, it's like double fucking like.
1982520	1983520	Right.
1983520	1984520	Because you got to commit.
1984520	1989520	Like the rap I can do without, without, but it's like, he wants me to do gibberish
1989520	1990520	Chinese.
1990520	1991520	Yeah.
1991520	1992520	Yeah.
1992520	1995520	There's no way, like I, and he's going to stand there in his fucking suit and
1995520	1997520	plays a, play a beat, which he did.
1997520	2001520	Well, I fucking did rap gibberish Chinese.
2001520	2002520	Yeah.
2002520	2004520	Absolutely no way to do it to his tasteful.
2004520	2005520	It's no way.
2005520	2006520	It's canceled Colbert.
2006520	2007520	There's no way around it.
2007520	2008520	Yes.
2008520	2009520	There's no fucking way.
2009520	2014520	I don't, unless you speak actual Chinese and even then someone's going to go,
2014520	2016520	this seems racist because admit it.
2016520	2021520	Sometimes they see racist when they speak real Chinese to us, very, very
2021520	2022520	aggressive white people.
2022520	2029520	We go like, like Jesus, that's your national anthem.
2029520	2030520	Well, did we talk about this?
2030520	2038520	I hope I'm not exposing like a secret or anything, but a Mandarin Chinese.
2038520	2042520	My, my wife is delicious.
2042520	2046520	My wife is Taiwanese and I discovered, and then, and at the time a friend of
2046520	2051520	mine was also dating a woman who was Taiwanese and he, and he discovered this
2051520	2052520	too.
2052520	2053520	And he's black.
2053520	2058520	There's a thing that people say in Chinese that sounds like the N word and
2058520	2062520	they say it a lot like, Oh, so there'll be like, I'm not, not, not, I put myself
2062520	2063520	in a corner.
2063520	2066520	I'm going to have to imitate speaking Chinese, but, but you know, it'd be like,
2066520	2068520	Oh, nigga, nigga.
2068520	2071520	And they say it a lot.
2071520	2074520	And I've heard stories about people getting in trouble for it because like
2074520	2076520	you're, you're in an elevator.
2076520	2077520	Yeah.
2077520	2078520	Yeah.
2078520	2079520	Yeah.
2079520	2082520	But, but they all, the best is though, that it comes out when people are
2082520	2085520	speaking like a mix of Chinese and English.
2085520	2092520	So I did witness a friend of my, a family friend of my wife's saying, oh, and
2092520	2094520	this nigga.
2094520	2095520	No.
2095520	2096520	Yeah.
2096520	2097520	Really?
2097520	2098520	Yeah.
2098520	2099520	Yeah.
2099520	2100520	Really.
2100520	2101520	Yeah.
2101520	2102520	Because she was like this, uh, yeah.
2102520	2103520	Wow.
2103520	2104520	It really means, uh, yeah.
2104520	2105520	I'm not sure.
2105520	2106520	What does it mean?
2106520	2107520	That.
2107520	2115520	So it's like, uh, that that's, that's a, that is a, that's like a, that's
2115520	2121520	like a world's lowest stakes, but ultimately most satisfying Twilight zone.
2122520	2123520	Yeah.
2123520	2134520	What's, uh, what's great is that, is that, is that none of that involves any
2134520	2135520	white people.
2135520	2143520	Like I could just, you just hang back and go.
2143520	2148520	They still don't know.
2148520	2150520	I wonder if they even know it's Christmas.
2150520	2154520	Do they know that there's an actual white Christmas that's not on December
2154520	2166520	25th that we only celebrate together on a golf course made of mayonnaise.
2166520	2171520	Uh, so I got into the, uh, elevator, which took a really long time to get
2171520	2172520	there.
2172520	2173520	Oh yeah.
2173520	2174520	That's where we were.
2174520	2175520	Yeah.
2175520	2178520	Thank you.
2178520	2180520	You guys have been great.
2180520	2183520	And, and I had experienced it taking a really long time.
2183520	2185520	I was like, that's, this is notable.
2185520	2188520	And then I got in the elevator and then it went down one, you know, you get in
2188520	2189520	on the 23rd floor.
2189520	2190520	It goes down to 22 stops.
2190520	2193520	Like you have that relief and then it's like, okay, this is why it took a long
2193520	2194520	time.
2194520	2195520	This is silly.
2195520	2196520	There must be peak hotel hours.
2196520	2200520	My hotel is a five year in a row winner of the four diamond award.
2200520	2201520	Whoa.
2201520	2202520	Hey.
2202520	2203520	I, that's 20 diamonds total.
2203520	2205520	Thank you, Adam Goldberg.
2205520	2209520	Uh, I told that to Aaron and she said, do you think that a number of diamonds
2209520	2210520	matter?
2210520	2213520	Like she said, does the best Western and Temecula, do they win the two diamond
2213520	2214520	award?
2214520	2215520	Sorry.
2215520	2216520	Temeculans.
2216520	2217520	Uh, sorry.
2217520	2220520	Best Westerners.
2220520	2224520	Um, the, uh, the answer I think is no.
2224520	2226520	I'm going to guess when I see four diamonds that much like four H or
2226520	2231520	represents four pillars, maybe of the hospitality industry, like a luxury
2231520	2232520	safety.
2232520	2233520	Pillow size.
2233520	2234520	Parking.
2234520	2237520	Those are the four diamonds.
2237520	2238520	Anyways.
2238520	2239520	HBO.
2239520	2240520	So I got in the elevator.
2240520	2244520	Well, it's everybody getting it at a certain point.
2244520	2247520	Like, and I already fucked up the story because you're going to, you're going
2247520	2250520	to imagine a crowded elevator, but that's the funny thing.
2250520	2252520	You have to, you have to realize it's not a crowded elevator.
2252520	2257520	It was like a gangly kid got in on 22 and then like another kid, like like
2257520	2259520	little tiny kids, like they're going to the pool.
2260520	2265520	They're, they're like, like pubescently averse to taking up space or hurting
2265520	2266520	anybody.
2266520	2267520	Like they're there.
2267520	2270520	You could, you could, you could, you could convince them to eat boogers.
2270520	2272520	Like they still, they're just like, I hope nobody talked to me.
2272520	2274520	I'm just probably don't need any convincing.
2274520	2275520	They're right.
2275520	2277520	They probably still think they're great.
2277520	2278520	Like, I don't know.
2278520	2280520	I don't know how old these kids are.
2280520	2281520	I'm just taking a while.
2281520	2282520	Like 23.
2282520	2283520	Oh yeah.
2283520	2284520	They eat boogers.
2285520	2287520	It's a, it's a, it's a very empty elevator.
2287520	2293520	And so I just, I'm already, I'm already over setting this up, but the
2293520	2298520	elevator opened on floor like 17 and this woman who was like, I guess like,
2298520	2302520	you know, my mom's age, like, I don't know, put her at 60 something, but she,
2302520	2305520	she, you know, still got some pep in her stepbook.
2305520	2309520	She's, she, she, she just like the elevator doors slowly opened and then,
2309520	2313520	and I'm just standing there and then she poked her head around the door and
2313520	2318520	then she, and then she like looked at and she went, Oh, that's it.
2318520	2319520	That's the story.
2319520	2323520	Like she just was like, what the fuck?
2323520	2325520	What the fuck?
2325520	2327520	I waited longer.
2327520	2328520	And then she didn't get in the elevator.
2328520	2332520	She got in and then, and then she just stood there and was just like,
2332520	2334520	like, wait, you're that rich.
2334520	2336520	You've never been with other people in an elevator.
2336520	2341520	Like for her second time in an elevator, the first one was to her beach house
2341520	2342520	from the beach.
2342520	2347520	She was like, she was like lifted by a parasail onto a thing.
2347520	2351520	Yeah. She was like, Oh, oh, like, like, like, there's people in here.
2351520	2352520	Yeah. What the hell is that?
2352520	2355520	And so I was like, all right, that's fucked up.
2355520	2357520	And then, and then another guy got in.
2357520	2360520	I don't think was with her, but he should have been, but he was,
2360520	2363520	he was the same age and he had one of those hats.
2363520	2366520	That's like a hat, like a, like a, like a TV show tourist hat,
2366520	2371520	like a hat, like a fishing hat kind of like a sun hat for a guy.
2371520	2373520	And, uh, and he had a short sleeve polo shirt.
2373520	2377520	He was like, he was like her age and he was holding this, uh,
2377520	2380520	despicable me minion plushie.
2380520	2381520	Oh, great.
2381520	2385520	And he, and he got in like really same floor, but not with her.
2385520	2387520	He's heading down, heading down.
2387520	2389520	He leaves his hotel room holding it.
2389520	2400520	Yeah. He was on his way to see the movie or protest a different one.
2400520	2401520	Yeah.
2401520	2402520	That's why the cops were there.
2402520	2408520	And he got into the elevator and he went.
2408520	2409520	And I wrote it down.
2409520	2413520	I wrote down exactly the way he said it because he was saying, I mean,
2413520	2415520	it's like, it's like, you're speaking out louder than elevator.
2415520	2416520	You're communicating with us.
2416520	2418520	Like, it's not a time for you to.
2418520	2422520	Like explore yourself, you know, like, like, like, like, like,
2422520	2424520	I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm so like, like,
2424520	2427520	if he didn't know that I was going to be sending me emotional messages,
2427520	2429520	like he, then he's insane.
2430520	2433520	He got on the elevator with his plushie doll and he stared at the floor
2433520	2434520	and he was shaking his head.
2434520	2438520	And he, and he, and he, and he said, this is insane.
2438520	2440520	Insane.
2440520	2442520	Insane.
2442520	2449520	And everyone in the elevator, me and the two kids were like, what?
2449520	2454520	Like it did take some time for the elevator to come to the 23rd floor.
2454520	2455520	Yes.
2455520	2457520	And then it took more time for them, I guess.
2457520	2458520	But wait a minute.
2458520	2460520	It would have stopped for them, right?
2460520	2461520	Yeah.
2461520	2463520	They couldn't have waited any longer than them pushing the down.
2463520	2466520	They must have pushed the down button when I got into the fucking thing.
2466520	2467520	They didn't have to wait.
2467520	2469520	I'm assuming he was talking about how long he had to wait.
2469520	2471520	Is it possible they're reacting to the same thing that like,
2471520	2474520	if we all got transported, like we're able to look in the elevator,
2474520	2477520	like you didn't, you somehow missed that there was a big pile of feces
2477520	2478520	on the floor or something.
2478520	2482520	Like, was something happening that you were oblivious to?
2482520	2485520	Maybe like, yeah, maybe before we got there, the elevator doors opened
2485520	2490520	and there was like three people taking a shit.
2490520	2496520	And then they went, we're doing this because of you.
2496520	2501520	And you can't do anything about it.
2501520	2502520	And they're like, we can't.
2502520	2503520	We're going to call security.
2503520	2504520	And they slapped the phone on their hands.
2504520	2505520	They're like, fuck you.
2505520	2506520	The door is closing.
2506520	2507520	And it went away.
2507520	2509520	And they're like, fuck, this is fucking insane.
2509520	2511520	These guys are taking shit to recall in security.
2511520	2512520	Security.
2513520	2515520	There's three guys who took a shit.
2515520	2517520	They said it's because of us.
2517520	2518520	They slapped our phone.
2518520	2521520	They're on their way up to 11.
2521520	2523520	They're on their way down to 11.
2523520	2524520	Okay.
2524520	2525520	Thank you for informing us.
2525520	2527520	We're going to stop, reroute the elevator,
2527520	2530520	bring it back up to you so you can confront them.
2530520	2531520	Okay, good.
2531520	2532520	Okay.
2532520	2534520	He says the elevator is coming back
2534520	2536520	and we'll be able to confront the guys that are taking a shit.
2536520	2538520	Oh.
2538520	2540520	Oh.
2540520	2541520	Sorry.
2541520	2542520	This is insane.
2542520	2543520	It's insane.
2543520	2544520	Okay.
2544520	2545520	That'll make sense now.
2545520	2546520	That's probably what happened.
2546520	2551520	They were kind of disappointed that we had done nothing.
2551520	2552520	Okay.
2557520	2561520	So then the hotel guy that calls you the cab,
2561520	2563520	he goes, can I get a cab?
2563520	2565520	They go, okay, I can get you a cab.
2565520	2567520	And then he tried to do the whistle thing
2567520	2568520	because he's seen it in movies.
2568520	2570520	And it's like he couldn't whistle.
2571520	2573520	He didn't do it until he did it.
2573520	2575520	He acted like he had whistled right,
2575520	2577520	but it was like...
2577520	2578520	And then he just waved.
2578520	2581520	It's 2014 and it's not New York.
2581520	2584520	We're out of fucking veranda and there's a line of cabs.
2589520	2591520	And then while I was pulling up,
2591520	2592520	I have a pet peeve about this.
2592520	2593520	I don't understand.
2593520	2594520	Someone explained this to me.
2594520	2596520	If you work in the hospitality industry,
2596520	2598520	I don't know.
2599520	2602520	What's with the third degree from that moment forward,
2602520	2605520	why does the guy got to know where you're going?
2605520	2607520	Why is he still...
2607520	2608520	The guy who pretended to whistle?
2608520	2611520	I said, I'm going to...
2612520	2614520	It's a comic book store?
2614520	2615520	Comic book store?
2615520	2616520	I don't know!
2616520	2617520	You have this conversation?
2617520	2618520	Yeah.
2618520	2619520	It's by the Guitar Center.
2619520	2621520	I thought he meant like, you know,
2621520	2622520	because you can...
2622520	2623520	Well, where are you going?
2623520	2625520	Because there's three classes of cab experience
2625520	2626520	here at the Hilton.
2626520	2628520	If you want a level five, you know,
2628520	2630520	that's with a 20-mile radius.
2630520	2631520	If there's some practical reason
2631520	2632520	why you're asking that question,
2632520	2634520	then the information you need is that it's near
2634520	2635520	the Guitar Center, I guess.
2635520	2636520	Will that help you?
2636520	2638520	Because I'm also assuming that you're asking this question
2638520	2639520	because you have a fucking encyclopedic knowledge
2639520	2641520	of goddamn Los Angeles,
2641520	2642520	so I can just tell you a fucking place
2642520	2643520	that's been here for 30 years,
2643520	2645520	and you could go, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
2645520	2646520	Okay, all right.
2646520	2648520	Here's why I asked.
2648520	2649520	This is all going to pay off.
2649520	2650520	But I was like...
2650520	2653520	It's over by the Guitar Center?
2653520	2655520	You're going to the Guitar Center?
2655520	2657520	He's mad that I was going to the Guitar Center.
2657520	2658520	I'm like, I'm not going to the Guitar Center.
2658520	2659520	It's over there.
2659520	2660520	And he's like, the Hollywood Bowl?
2660520	2665520	I'm like, no, I don't play guitar in a show.
2665520	2667520	I think he was thinking that I was like...
2667520	2669520	Maybe he was thinking, wait a minute.
2669520	2672520	If this guy's a rock star,
2672520	2674520	maybe I can save him a trip to this guitar store
2674520	2679520	he's talking about and just send him to the bowl.
2679520	2681520	I'll run and get the guitar for him.
2681520	2683520	And before you know it, it's Goodbye Valley.
2683520	2684520	Hello, concierge.
2684520	2685520	Did he think...
2685520	2687520	Wait, you said Guitar Center and he's like,
2687520	2688520	you mean the Hollywood Bowl?
2688520	2692520	Did he think the Hollywood Bowl is the Guitar Center?
2692520	2693520	Oh, yeah, that's what he...
2693520	2695520	Yeah, the Guitar Center.
2695520	2698520	Yeah, so he thinks I'm just like walking like a morgue
2698520	2700520	or something and I'm going like,
2700520	2705520	I'm going to where the guitars are.
2705520	2710520	I wouldn't call a cab if I didn't know where to go.
2710520	2712520	I'm going to the Laff factory.
2712520	2714520	You're going to a stand-up comedy place?
2714520	2715520	Yes.
2715520	2717520	He didn't understand the name of a place.
2717520	2719520	Yeah, I went to the Friendship Place.
2719520	2722520	No, my wife and I.
2722520	2723520	We are separated.
2723520	2725520	I go to Happy Place?
2725520	2727520	No, I know what you're talking about.
2727520	2736520	Take him to the noodle comer.
2736520	2738520	Because he knows three of those places
2738520	2739520	and one gives him a kickback.
2739520	2741520	I'm going to work, man.
2741520	2742520	And I live here...
2742520	2744520	I'm wearing a shirt that says Los Angeles
2744520	2747520	because I own this city.
2747520	2751520	I am having a brief separation from my lover.
2751520	2753520	We are wedding.
2753520	2754520	It seems like...
2754520	2755520	Ready?
2755520	2758520	Yeah, I'm going to do that.
2758520	2759520	I'm going to...
2759520	2763520	Like, I've been down and then the kid from Powder.
2763520	2766520	Right.
2766520	2769520	But I can't see it.
2769520	2770520	I believe you.
2770520	2771520	Good.
2771520	2772520	I'm poor.
2772520	2773520	We're under heat lengths.
2773520	2776520	Are they hotter than usual because of the cameras?
2776520	2781520	At first I thought that was a ridiculous question.
2781520	2783520	Because brighter.
2783520	2784520	Maybe they needed more light.
2784520	2786520	The cameras drink up the light.
2786520	2787520	It's always...
2787520	2788520	It's a thing.
2788520	2789520	It's lights and they're hot.
2789520	2792520	I think last time I was here I was drunker.
2792520	2793520	Yeah.
2793520	2795520	I mean...
2795520	2797520	Jesus Christ.
2798520	2801520	I'm like, you know, on the verge of panicking.
2801520	2803520	About how hot you are?
2803520	2804520	No, no.
2804520	2805520	Just generally.
2810520	2811520	I don't mean to throw that at your feet.
2811520	2814520	I didn't like go for it guy when he was saying go for it,
2814520	2815520	just shit your pants.
2815520	2816520	Maybe I should.
2816520	2817520	Go for it.
2817520	2819520	Now that he's go for it guy.
2819520	2820520	We know two things.
2820520	2823520	We like him and he's going to go too far.
2823520	2826520	Because his primate instinct comes in threes.
2826520	2827520	He's going to...
2827520	2828520	At the worst time.
2828520	2829520	Get it out of your system.
2829520	2830520	I'm...
2830520	2831520	It's Adam.
2831520	2832520	Oh, it's Adam?
2832520	2833520	Oh, that was Adam almost.
2833520	2835520	Oh, Adam's the go for it guy?
2835520	2836520	Wow.
2837520	2838520	All right.
2838520	2839520	Okay.
2839520	2840520	Whoa.
2840520	2841520	All right.
2841520	2842520	Comes right up.
2842520	2844520	Wow.
2849520	2850520	That's pretty good.
2854520	2855520	He went for it.
2855520	2856520	I like the...
2856520	2857520	He practiced what he preaches.
2857520	2858520	That's good.
2858520	2860520	Sometimes you got to go for it.
2860520	2862520	It's fitting that we got a glimpse of...
2862520	2863520	Did you like that in Ireland?
2863520	2865520	Did you like your glimpse of Adam Goldberg?
2867520	2868520	Yeah.
2868520	2870520	I expect your wife asked who's Adam Goldberg
2870520	2871520	because I mentioned him.
2871520	2872520	Yeah.
2872520	2873520	That's Adam Goldberg.
2873520	2875520	And she said who's Adam Goldberg?
2875520	2877520	I said he's the hamburgler.
2877520	2878520	Yeah.
2879520	2880520	He did.
2880520	2881520	That was the metaphor.
2881520	2882520	Yeah.
2882520	2885520	Every mythology needs, like, a test.
2886520	2889520	Like, like, like, Harman Town's a place for nerds.
2889520	2890520	It's a place where you can't be bullied.
2890520	2891520	Really?
2897520	2899520	Everyone's got Asperger's.
2899520	2901520	Everyone's got it, got it.
2908520	2910520	I mean, he is afflicted.
2910520	2911520	Well, that was...
2911520	2912520	It's not about...
2912520	2915520	If Asperger's just meant you were charming,
2915520	2917520	everyone would want it.
2917520	2918520	Yeah.
2918520	2921520	Remember, it is technically a disease.
2921520	2923520	I got to say, I thought that was pretty beautiful,
2923520	2926520	that little cross-the-stage move with the...
2926520	2927520	No, it was good.
2927520	2928520	And they liked it because it was like...
2928520	2929520	It was a pop.
2929520	2930520	Yeah, it was quick.
2930520	2931520	It was graceful.
2931520	2932520	It was quick.
2932520	2933520	And they liked it because they like him.
2934520	2936520	And he got dressed up tonight.
2936520	2938520	Yeah, he had a jacket on.
2938520	2940520	He knew more about tonight than I did.
2941520	2944520	So, on the screen, there's a ticker, a news ticker.
2944520	2947520	And the news ticker, it's buggy.
2947520	2948520	Like, it stops.
2948520	2949520	It stalls out.
2949520	2954520	So, like, what it said on the news ticker was,
2954520	2958520	small volcanic eruption in Iceland, but no ash yet.
2958520	2960520	French screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière,
2960520	2963520	also named as one of the recipients.
2964520	2965520	Period.
2965520	2966520	Like, it just stopped there.
2966520	2967520	I was like...
2967520	2968520	I thought that was funny.
2968520	2969520	It's good.
2970520	2971520	So, I wrote it down.
2971520	2972520	Yeah.
2972520	2974520	Because otherwise, as dumb as that was,
2974520	2976520	imagine me telling a story about that.
2976520	2977520	But then it was a thing.
2977520	2979520	And it was a guy that said, like, a shoe,
2979520	2981520	but then the shoe stopped and then the thing.
2983520	2986520	Bruce Willis wears fake feet and die hard.
2986520	2989520	Bruce Willis wears fake feet and die hard, everybody.
2989520	2991520	You sent me a screen grab.
2991520	2992520	Your friend tipped you off, right?
2992520	2993520	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2993520	2994520	And it makes sense.
2994520	2995520	If you think about it for a second, I mean,
2995520	2996520	he's running around.
2996520	2998520	The actor, Bruce Willis, is running around bare feet
2998520	3001520	on a set that is an actual building.
3001520	3003520	I guess there's a limit to how much they can scrape up
3003520	3005520	all the broken glass and nails.
3005520	3008520	Ruben sent a screen grab of Bruce Willis.
3008520	3012520	He's, like, landing on his side in the shoot the glass scene, probably.
3012520	3013520	I think it's after.
3013520	3016520	I think he's jumping away from the helicopter
3016520	3017520	on the roof or something.
3017520	3018520	Yeah.
3018520	3019520	But, yeah, he lands on his...
3019520	3020520	And he's...
3020520	3022520	It's insane how, like, it's like, wow.
3022520	3025520	He's just wearing, like, little feet-shaped shoes.
3025520	3026520	Yeah.
3026520	3028520	Like, they have a little cuff on them.
3028520	3029520	His pants are all different.
3029520	3030520	It's very...
3030520	3031520	And a little ankle knob.
3031520	3032520	Yeah, yeah.
3032520	3033520	It's weird.
3033520	3034520	When you look at it, you're like,
3034520	3036520	oh, now let's talk about all the weird things
3036520	3039520	that they think make a foot look like a foot.
3039520	3041520	Like, what they think is important.
3041520	3044520	There probably wasn't a podiatrist in the bunch of them.
3044520	3047520	It was probably just, like, really awesome special effects guys going,
3047520	3050520	like, what about that bone knobby thing?
3050520	3052520	Show me your foot, Bruce.
3052520	3055520	Yeah, see, in the distance, I think about when I see your foot,
3055520	3058520	like, and they never, like, looked anything up, and...
3058520	3061520	I mean, some of you, he's wearing, like, foot-shaped shoes.
3061520	3064520	What if he was wearing them because Bruce Willis' feet are all fucked up?
3064520	3065520	Oh, yeah.
3065520	3067520	What if Bruce Willis has all fucked up feet?
3067520	3069520	You ever see Vince Vaughn's thumb?
3069520	3070520	Yeah.
3070520	3071520	Yeah.
3071520	3073520	He's a fucking monster.
3073520	3075520	You're a fucking monster.
3080520	3081520	Yeah, there's a...
3082520	3085520	I went Googling once for Vince Vaughn's thumb,
3085520	3089520	and I discovered that there's all these results about deformed celebrities.
3089520	3090520	There's a rabbit hole.
3090520	3091520	It's actually kind of uplifting,
3091520	3094520	because it's like, basically, you can't swing a cat in a room full of celebrities
3094520	3097520	without hitting one that has one fucked up part of their body,
3097520	3100520	even the ones that are famous for being sexy and normal and stuff,
3100520	3101520	which is great, actually.
3101520	3102520	That's a great thing to learn.
3102520	3104520	It's like, if you ever notice that Jennifer Lawrence's knee, like,
3104520	3106520	comes outside with her leg.
3106520	3108520	It's great, because it's like, we do feel like,
3108520	3109520	when we look at all these magazines,
3109520	3111520	all that shit is like, oh, it's all fake, you know?
3111520	3114520	And, yeah, there's a lot of people with way better asses than you,
3114520	3116520	but they got it fucked up.
3116520	3117520	There's something fucked up, man.
3117520	3120520	Their kidney's going to explode or something.
3120520	3124520	They're monsters like you, because you just can't.
3124520	3125520	It's just a crapshoot.
3125520	3128520	It's just like a big fucking...
3128520	3131520	You're just building a person from scratch every time.
3131520	3133520	There's never nothing wrong with them.
3133520	3137520	The most beautiful people in the world are still disgusting meat sacks.
3138520	3142520	Yeah, gross blobs of fucking chaotic flesh.
3142520	3145520	Any minute now could just explode in any part of it.
3145520	3150520	And then part of it is technically some absorbed sibling
3150520	3153520	that they'll never know they had.
3153520	3158520	Owen Wilson has a fucking tooth on his shoulder that kind of is like,
3158520	3160520	are you going to finish that?
3160520	3165520	Wasn't I talking to you about my wife and I were watching this old documentary
3165520	3167520	about, it's called I Am Not a Freak.
3167520	3169520	You can watch it on YouTube.
3169520	3176520	And there's this Chinese guy who has his twin's head on his neck.
3176520	3178520	And it's sort of a head.
3178520	3180520	But the thing that's the most ahead is...
3180520	3186520	I would like to look at it like his body is on his twin's neck.
3189520	3191520	As a 21st century...
3191520	3193520	Well, if so, the doctors killed him.
3194520	3196520	They got rid of him and left the twin.
3196520	3197520	Oh, they cut off.
3197520	3198520	Yeah, yeah.
3198520	3200520	But the thing that was really freaky is that when he...
3200520	3202520	You guys, I'm not blaming you.
3202520	3209520	But, I mean, if you had a face on your neck, it wouldn't be an aw.
3210520	3212520	The day it was removed.
3212520	3219520	When the primary face moved his lips, the other face moved its lips.
3220520	3223520	Yeah.
3223520	3225520	It was cute.
3225520	3231520	I feel like that's an old thing or maybe that's something that happens in the world's most populous country or something.
3231520	3241520	But when I was a kid, there was a guy with that exact situation.
3244520	3245520	It might be the same guy.
3245520	3246520	It might be the same guy.
3246520	3247520	Superpower?
3247520	3251520	I don't know how they view it over there, but there was the same guy.
3251520	3252520	Maybe he was like a hippie back then.
3252520	3254520	Maybe he was like, hey, man, I'm 23.
3254520	3255520	Let's fuck it up.
3255520	3256520	What do you mean?
3256520	3257520	What do you think, Pablo?
3257520	3259520	I'm angry.
3259520	3260520	That's why he grew the...
3260520	3262520	And now you saw the documentary.
3262520	3263520	He was like, get it off.
3263520	3266520	Its eyes follow me everywhere.
3266520	3274520	Well, it's scary and fascinating because the reason that was there and the reason that the lips were in sync was that that's how identical twins work.
3275520	3278520	You start as the same being and split.
3278520	3283520	So if you split improperly, well, I don't want to say improperly, differently.
3283520	3291520	If you split differently, then you could still have the same brain was controlling two heads that were not supposed to...
3291520	3293520	Or were...
3295520	3297520	Twins are monsters there.
3298520	3306520	What's weird, I don't see anybody talking about this, how the fertility revolution is like...
3306520	3308520	Lots and lots of twins and triplets.
3308520	3309520	You now just meet...
3309520	3313520	Probably everybody in this room knows three people who have had twins.
3313520	3321520	But you know what is not more common, I think, if I'm not wrong about this, is identical twins because fertility drugs make you likelier to have multiple eggs.
3321520	3326520	Yeah, and that's what's uncomfortable too, but also kind of uplifting because, hey, this is what life is about.
3327520	3333520	I was just learning this from our friend Clay at work that his wife just had twins a year ago.
3333520	3335520	And it's like, I never got that.
3335520	3342520	I thought they were like, I don't know, I just thought it was like they were injecting the mother with like super fertility juice or something.
3342520	3345520	And it just made her so fertile that there were like kids growing everywhere.
3345520	3348520	Like, I'll take that sperm cell, that sperm cell.
3348520	3358520	But they're actually, they're implanting blastocysts or whatever, zygotes, in the lining of the womb anticipating...
3358520	3360520	That most of them won't stick.
3360520	3363520	But I mean, that's life.
3363520	3366520	A lot of them don't. Not everybody has twins.
3366520	3370520	And that's why you get those like octomoms and stuff. Those octomoms.
3370520	3372520	Yeah, all those octomoms.
3372520	3375520	Is because sometimes they'll like, they'll keep pushing it, you know?
3375520	3380520	And as we have established on this show, doctors have absolutely no...
3380520	3384520	They're identical to serial killers, but they had a support system.
3385520	3390520	You can find a doctor that'll be like, well, maybe if we put nine babies in there...
3390520	3395520	I feel like you got a 10% chance, so nine babies will equal one baby.
3395520	3397520	And they're like, it's all nine babies.
3397520	3400520	He's like, well, call the press. I'm an amazing doctor.
3403520	3406520	You spent all the time wondering if you could do it.
3406520	3409520	You didn't stop to think if you should, if you should, if you should.
3410520	3412520	I didn't have a table to go bloom.
3413520	3417520	Speaking of Jeff Goldblum, let's bring out our Jeff Goldblum, Spencer Crittenden.
3417520	3436520	The usual gauntlet I run up here is now occupied by camera obstacles.
3436520	3438520	It's even more difficult.
3441520	3443520	That's the price of success?
3443520	3446520	I guess it's the price of success.
3448520	3452520	How are you guys doing? What were you talking about, doctors?
3452520	3454520	Yeah.
3454520	3456520	Elevators?
3456520	3459520	Yeah, doctors, elevators, twins, gangs.
3459520	3465520	I mean, I like you. I'm very occupied by the Minecraft faces.
3465520	3467520	I want to get back to the Minecraft.
3468520	3469520	The Minecraft discussion?
3469520	3471520	The ME storage.
3471520	3474520	Oh, yeah. Let me tell you something about ME storage.
3475520	3478520	Those stack sizes don't cap at 64.
3482520	3484520	I know it's a joke to you guys, but I'm fucking...
3484520	3485520	It's no joke.
3485520	3490520	I'm not going out after the show. I don't care how many of you want to talk to me about how amazing I am.
3490520	3501520	I'm going back to a hotel room to play Minecraft because of how exciting it is for me that the stack sizes have no cap.
3501520	3507520	It's great. It's like the Internet of Things on Minecraft.
3507520	3510520	Is this a slightly heightened Spencer today, or am I imagining things?
3510520	3513520	Heightless? I mean, it's the opposite of heightened of anything.
3513520	3519520	Yeah, but heightened your Spencer-ness, which is not itself loud.
3519520	3523520	You mean just like being a giant douche or whatever?
3523520	3525520	Yeah, a giant douche. No, Spencer.
3525520	3530520	I think he means have you elevated yourself? Have you gotten extra high tonight?
3531520	3533520	Oh, yeah. I guess that might be what I'm detecting.
3533520	3539520	I don't know how many people know this, but I was in Pittsburgh over the weekend and you can't take weed on a plane.
3541520	3543520	Shut up.
3543520	3545520	You just got to go for it.
3547520	3549520	Smuggling. Go for it.
3549520	3553520	Wait, did I tell you this? This friend of mine was telling me about how to bring weed on a plane,
3553520	3557520	and I thought he was joking, and then years later found out that he was serious.
3557520	3563520	He's just like, I just take and just throw it all over my bag. I just tear it up and just throw little bits of weed all over my suitcase.
3563520	3570520	That's really fucking genius, man. That wouldn't come up in the scanners at all. It would just be, oh, he's got lint in his bag.
3570520	3574520	Yeah, well, that's what he said, and years later I found out he wasn't joking. I thought he was doing a bit.
3574520	3576520	No, that's blowing my mind.
3578520	3585520	And then I was like, but then don't you have to empty out your entire suitcase and shake out all of it, and he's like, well, yeah.
3586520	3589520	And then you gather it up on the floor of your hotel?
3589520	3596520	When I was, you do some weird things, man. When I was in the Pittsburgh hotel, I ended up finding some,
3596520	3602520	and I didn't, you know, they always say it's going to cost you money if you smoke in a hotel room and stuff,
3602520	3606520	and I don't want to do that. Pay money, I mean.
3606520	3608520	What do you mean by that?
3608520	3611520	If you smoke in a hotel room, they charge you $200.
3611520	3614520	If you smoke in a hotel room, they can smell the...
3615520	3619520	This is very common knowledge. It's all over. There's signs everywhere.
3619520	3621520	But you don't smoke cigarettes. What is it?
3621520	3626520	It says smoking. It doesn't say if you smoke cigarettes. It says smoking.
3628520	3633520	Smoking means smoking. I don't know how else to put it. You could smoke any number of things,
3633520	3637520	and it would all technically be banned by the language of these signs.
3638520	3644520	I mean, it's not... I don't know what... It says no smoking.
3646520	3652520	Anyway, so I'm in the bathroom. I'm in the bathroom, and I'm like, well, I don't want any of this smell to linger,
3652520	3659520	so I grab up all the towels, and I put them outside of my room. Or outside, not the room, the bathroom.
3659520	3663520	And then I'm like, well, fuck. There's this bathrobe hanging here, and so I put that in the closet.
3664520	3667520	And then I'm like, well, what about this shower curtain?
3667520	3674520	And so I start taking the shower curtain down, and it's like 18 rings that have to be individually un-thinged,
3674520	3680520	and then I ended up scratching the curtain rod because it's painted, and it's not meant to do that.
3680520	3687520	I put that in the thing. And then, you know, because my theory is water vapor is going to absorb these scent particles,
3687520	3689520	because water does absorb scent particles.
3689520	3691520	So it's not just a breeze.
3691520	3695520	If you don't have a breeze, if you spray a water bottle, that's better than not doing anything.
3695520	3702520	So applying that step in macro, I turn on the shower, getting it nice and hot, getting it all foggy and stuff,
3702520	3707520	and I start enjoying some of this stuff, and it's great, but then it gets all steamy,
3707520	3712520	and I'm getting, like, real sweaty, and it's all getting slick, and, like, everything's this nice tile,
3712520	3715520	and it's all slippery, and I'm, like, slipping around.
3716520	3721520	And I got the lighter wet, and I got my hands all wet, and the pipes all wet, and I'm, like,
3721520	3725520	well, fuck, I've got to dry this out, and there's, like, no towels anywhere,
3725520	3731520	because they're all outside of the room, and I'm, like, slipping on the tile floor,
3731520	3734520	and it's, like, 3 in the morning. I don't know if I mentioned that.
3734520	3741520	You went into the bathroom at the hotel, and you used a fogger? Is that what you called it?
3741520	3746520	No, I turned on the shower to hot water, so it made all sorts of steam and fog.
3746520	3747520	To mask?
3747520	3753520	Because that water vapor would then absorb the smell particles,
3753520	3756520	and then when it dissipated and recondensed.
3756520	3759520	Were you vaping or just smoking?
3759520	3760520	No, just smoking.
3760520	3765520	Okay, and so, like, you thought probably correctly, I would never imply otherwise,
3765520	3770520	that a bunch of steam would, like, yeah, it would do what a bong does, which is the water would, like...
3770520	3771520	That's my theory, yeah.
3771520	3775520	...latch on to the things that either stink or hurt or whatever, yeah, okay.
3775520	3780520	All right, so I just had to catch up, because I thought maybe you were using some kind of volcanic, like...
3780520	3783520	I thought you had brought some kind of, like, vapor-powered thing.
3783520	3786520	I was, like, boiling the weed in the shower.
3786520	3790520	All right, so it's all slippery, and there's no towels in here.
3790520	3791520	Yeah.
3791520	3792520	Are you naked?
3792520	3793520	Yeah, no, no.
3793520	3798520	Well, I'm mostly naked. Yeah, I'm just in my underwear, because I don't want to...
3799520	3801520	It's hot enough wearing no clothes.
3801520	3805520	I mean, God forbid, I would be miserable in clothes.
3805520	3807520	So, I mean, that's pretty much...
3807520	3814520	Yeah, then I took a shower, and then I noticed I looked like a crazy person after I got out of that shower.
3814520	3815520	Just, like...
3815520	3816520	I think you just...
3816520	3818520	Well, I mean, I know that you know this.
3818520	3820520	You just got high, and you freaked out.
3820520	3821520	No, no, but my skin...
3821520	3825520	Because all the hot water makes your skin really red, you know, and flushed.
3825520	3829520	And then since I was high, I had these just, like, death brown circles under my eyes,
3829520	3833520	and then my eyes were just, like, solid red, you know?
3833520	3836520	And I just looked like an inhuman creature.
3836520	3837520	Uh-huh.
3837520	3839520	It was insane.
3839520	3845520	Well, I'm not saying you asked me to help you with this, but the next time you travel,
3845520	3850520	and you want to get high in your hotel room, I will send you $200.
3850520	3852520	And a little on the top.
3852520	3853520	Yeah, well...
3853520	3854520	Because I don't think they're talking about pot...
3854520	3855520	I know they are.
3855520	3858520	Which they don't want you to smoke even in your own home.
3858520	3861520	If someone's having a bad day, they're going to charge $200.
3861520	3862520	Yeah, exactly.
3862520	3863520	So fuck them.
3863520	3864520	That's the price.
3864520	3865520	That's their price.
3865520	3866520	That's why you tip the cleaning lady.
3866520	3867520	You tip the cleaning lady.
3867520	3868520	A lot of money.
3868520	3869520	Yeah.
3869520	3870520	Like all of it.
3870520	3871520	Wait, can I...
3871520	3873520	Sorry, just a backpedal a second.
3873520	3876520	I don't want to spend too much time on this, but this story started with you saying that
3876520	3878520	you can't bring weed on a plane.
3878520	3879520	You can't.
3879520	3880520	But then you did...
3880520	3881520	So you just got some, though, when you got there.
3881520	3882520	Yeah, yeah.
3882520	3885520	But what's the relevance if you can't bring it on the plane?
3885520	3886520	It's like...
3886520	3887520	You're not going to count on that.
3887520	3888520	Well, this was like...
3888520	3889520	Oh, okay.
3889520	3890520	Good intentions of him to go, hey, I'm Spencer.
3890520	3891520	I'm here.
3891520	3892520	Right.
3892520	3893520	Yeah, I finally...
3893520	3894520	Yeah, this was the final triumph.
3894520	3896520	It was the last night I was there, you know?
3896520	3897520	Oh, okay.
3897520	3898520	Okay.
3898520	3899520	This was my score, you know?
3899520	3900520	After a long...
3900520	3901520	By the way, okay.
3901520	3908520	I had to buy a lighter off of a tattoo convention attendee.
3908520	3910520	There was a tattoo convention in town.
3910520	3911520	I mean, I should mention.
3911520	3913520	I was in Pittsburgh to do this...
3913520	3917520	There's this improv group called the Knights of the Arcade
3917520	3919520	that do this comedy show called...
3919520	3920520	That's what it's called.
3920520	3922520	Out of this bar called the Arcade Comedy.
3922520	3923520	No, it's not a bar.
3923520	3924520	It's just a comedy place.
3924520	3925520	Arcade Comedy.
3925520	3926520	Arcade Comedy.
3926520	3927520	It's not really comedy.
3927520	3931520	It's more of a misguided attempt.
3931520	3935520	And they put me up and they had me come out there
3935520	3937520	and they made me this T-shirt.
3937520	3938520	It's pretty nice.
3938520	3939520	What's it say there?
3939520	3940520	Philadelphia.
3940520	3941520	Philadelphia.
3941520	3942520	Home of the sandwich.
3942520	3944520	Home of the sandwich.
3944520	3946520	It's true.
3946520	3947520	They made that shirt for you?
3947520	3949520	Well, they made a small run
3949520	3951520	and I think they were kind of selling them
3951520	3952520	and they gave me some.
3952520	3954520	They actually gave you one, Dan.
3954520	3955520	I have one.
3955520	3959520	So, I mean, you have plenty of clothes coming in right now.
3959520	3962520	Can I ask one thing about pot on a plane?
3962520	3964520	I don't know.
3964520	3970520	Why can't you just put it in the bottom of your sock?
3970520	3972520	Like, they make you take your shoes off
3972520	3974520	but you can just walk on like enough pot
3974520	3977520	to get you high for like four days.
3977520	3980520	Like if you split it up into each arch of each foot.
3980520	3981520	Yeah.
3981520	3984520	Especially if you volunteer to go through their fucking...
3984520	3986520	I think it's one of those things where it's like...
3986520	3987520	I'd rather shove it up my ass or something.
3987520	3988520	Well, all right.
3988520	3990520	I mean...
3990520	3992520	Like you use a condom.
3992520	3993520	It's fine.
3993520	3994520	Well, I just...
3994520	3996520	I do think that, look, for the most part,
3996520	3998520	they're probably not looking for that, right?
3998520	4000520	So, like, for the most part, I bet you could get it through.
4000520	4003520	I was at an airport and I saw this woman,
4003520	4007520	this like 20-something woman getting escorted away,
4007520	4010520	not in cuffs or anything, holding a samurai sword.
4010520	4012520	And I was like, what?
4012520	4014520	And I said to the guy like waiting there,
4014520	4016520	I was like, what's...
4016520	4018520	Would she try to bring a samurai sword on a plane?
4018520	4019520	And he said, well, no.
4019520	4021520	Fortunately, we stopped her before she got to security
4021520	4023520	or she would be in jail right now.
4023520	4025520	Although that's an interesting distinction in itself.
4025520	4029520	I guess she hasn't actually tried to go through security.
4029520	4031520	She hasn't yet clearly...
4031520	4034520	Although if she's in line, that's just the same thing, isn't it?
4034520	4036520	She's planning on bringing the samurai sword.
4036520	4037520	It's just they were ineffectual
4037520	4039520	and couldn't get her there in time.
4039520	4040520	Yeah.
4040520	4041520	So they caught her early.
4041520	4045520	Also, airports are where thought can be a crime.
4045520	4047520	People get...
4047520	4048520	People have tweeted.
4048520	4050520	You always knew you couldn't make a joke.
4050520	4053520	You can't say hi to your friend Jack too quickly at the airport
4053520	4056520	or you could get thrown in prison.
4058520	4059520	That's true.
4059520	4060520	That's true.
4060520	4061520	But a guy tweeted...
4061520	4063520	I think this was in the UK.
4063520	4066520	A guy tweeted a joke about...
4066520	4069520	He said he was going to go destroy America.
4069520	4073520	But that means party in Britain.
4073520	4075520	Yeah, it was something like that.
4075520	4079520	But he tweeted it and after he got home from the airport
4079520	4082520	and hadn't destroyed America, people showed up.
4082520	4083520	Oh, then they got him.
4083520	4084520	Yeah.
4084520	4085520	At his home.
4085520	4087520	It was like halfway into...
4087520	4090520	Probably pajama bottoms around his ankles.
4090520	4091520	I just got back.
4091520	4098520	I haven't been able to watch British Debbie Does Dallas.
4098520	4102520	Debbie requests permission to do Dallas.
4105520	4108520	Anyways, you'd rather shove it up your ass
4108520	4112520	I thought the objective was to get it into the city.
4112520	4114520	I would put it in the arch of my foot.
4114520	4117520	For me, ultimately, the reason I would never do any of that
4117520	4119520	is just because I'd be too scared.
4119520	4120520	It's like...
4120520	4122520	You'd smell it if it was in your foot.
4122520	4123520	Who smells it?
4123520	4127520	The guard, the people whose job it is to get that stuff out of there.
4127520	4128520	Are they looking for it?
4128520	4129520	Many things, yeah.
4129520	4130520	They want you in jail.
4130520	4131520	Don't get mad.
4131520	4132520	First and foremost.
4132520	4135520	No, I mean, but yeah.
4136520	4139520	Well, then his friend's scattering his weed throughout his suitcase.
4139520	4141520	It's fucking genius.
4141520	4142520	All right.
4142520	4143520	No, no.
4143520	4146520	When you have your feet, that's like a small heat engine
4146520	4147520	that's like...
4147520	4150520	It's heating it up and it's making it smell danker than usual.
4150520	4152520	It's like when you get in my car on a hot day.
4154520	4155520	All right.
4155520	4157520	Put on your feet.
4157520	4158520	All right.
4158520	4159520	Well, I...
4160520	4163520	Before 9-11, you could travel with drugs like...
4163520	4164520	Because it was like...
4164520	4165520	This is a weird thing.
4165520	4169520	Like, before 9-11, which should have marked the point
4169520	4173520	where they stopped looking for drugs entirely because...
4173520	4174520	No longer the priority.
4174520	4178520	We didn't find the guys that did 9-11,
4178520	4182520	but I got the impression from 9-11 that none of them got high.
4184520	4186520	Just based on the shit they were into.
4186520	4189520	They weren't planning in a room with like black lights and...
4189520	4192520	I feel like maybe if they got higher, it wouldn't have happened.
4192520	4193520	So I felt...
4193520	4197520	But suffice it to say, like, definitely, okay, let's stop.
4197520	4200520	Let's focus all the German shepherds on smelling things
4200520	4203520	that can blow stuff up and let's forget about the other stuff.
4203520	4206520	I could go on and on about that, but I'm not Doug Benson.
4206520	4211520	But the crazy thing is that it's before 9-11
4211520	4213520	when you could actually travel with more drugs.
4213520	4214520	Like, it was...
4214520	4218520	I remember my friend in Milwaukee, like, accidentally,
4218520	4219520	because it was just so nonchalant.
4219520	4222520	If you were a casual pot smoker,
4222520	4225520	you would have maybe a rolled-up plastic bag of weed
4225520	4228520	in your jean pocket and you had to put your keys in your wallet
4228520	4231520	and a little plastic thing and you walked through a metal detector
4231520	4235520	and one time my friend went and put a nickel bag of pot
4235520	4238520	in this plastic thing and the security guard was like...
4238520	4241520	And he went, oops, and went like that
4241520	4243520	and started going through the metal detectors
4243520	4245520	and the person went, what was that?
4245520	4246520	And he said, it wasn't metal.
4247520	4250520	And it worked.
4250520	4253520	And they went, all right, go.
4253520	4258520	Because he's not going to use that to hurt anyone.
4258520	4261520	This story, my 10th grade geometry teacher,
4261520	4264520	who's this really fascinating, strange guy,
4264520	4266520	who was the last person in the world you would think
4266520	4267520	would be telling a story like this,
4267520	4270520	was talking about how he got arrested.
4270520	4272520	Even this is a strange story to be telling your 10th grade geometry class,
4272520	4274520	because I think he was arrested for drunk driving
4275520	4276520	and he's just telling us this story.
4276520	4277520	I don't know.
4277520	4282520	But he said that he had a block of hash in his trunk.
4282520	4285520	And I was at the time picturing like a bale of hay,
4285520	4288520	but I assume it was just like a little...
4288520	4291520	But they impounded all of his shit
4291520	4293520	and he spent the night in prison
4293520	4295520	and he's just like, well, they're going to find my...
4295520	4296520	And this was in Alabama or something?
4296520	4298520	He's like, I'm dead, you know?
4298520	4301520	And then, again, this is a 10th grade geometry teacher
4301520	4302520	telling his class this story.
4302520	4305520	But he says that he got out to the little place
4305520	4307520	where they're handing your belongings back
4307520	4308520	and checking it off.
4308520	4312520	And they were like, car keys, you know...
4312520	4313520	I don't know, gum.
4313520	4315520	I'm trying to lead up...
4315520	4316520	Wallet.
4316520	4317520	Wallet.
4317520	4318520	Yeah, wallet.
4318520	4321520	Geology textbooks.
4321520	4323520	Geological sample.
4323520	4324520	Skittles tropical.
4324520	4326520	Geological sample.
4326520	4329520	The cops just handed him his block of weed.
4330520	4333520	They just assumed from contextual clues that it was...
4334520	4337520	Looks like we put another innocent in one in here for a while.
4337520	4340520	Give him back his educational materials.
4341520	4345520	I guess he'll be trying to improve the country for a while.
4347520	4349520	Yeah, well, boy, yeah.
4349520	4352520	If you let everybody out of prison right now
4352520	4356520	who is in it for doing shit that doesn't hurt anybody,
4356520	4358520	we would save a lot of money.
4359520	4361520	And no one would get hurt.
4361520	4362520	Look it up.
4362520	4363520	Google it.
4363520	4364520	Get mad about it.
4364520	4365520	I'm 41.
4365520	4366520	I don't care.
4367520	4369520	Except a lot of people my age.
4369520	4371520	Including people I knew in Milwaukee.
4371520	4373520	I knew a guy who got busted.
4375520	4376520	They had this rule.
4376520	4377520	I think they still have it.
4377520	4379520	They might have just recently changed it.
4379520	4382520	If you had a plant that counted,
4382520	4385520	they could weigh the fucking flower pot.
4386520	4387520	That's an exaggeration.
4387520	4389520	But it was something that absurd.
4389520	4392520	If you got caught with a plant of marijuana,
4392520	4396520	it was like they could weigh it all or something.
4396520	4399520	It was like, wow, you've got a million pounds of...
4399520	4401520	It comes out of the ground!
4401520	4403520	Made by the earth.
4404520	4406520	Made by the earth!
4407520	4410520	Bringing a couple of strands together from earlier.
4410520	4413520	I'm going to try to bring a couple of things together.
4413520	4414520	Chinese people should get more high.
4414520	4416520	Chinese people should get more high.
4417520	4419520	They'd be less racist.
4419520	4420520	I was Googling.
4420520	4422520	You were talking about cops.
4422520	4424520	You can't find statistics online.
4424520	4425520	I think I told you this story.
4425520	4428520	I was writing for Key and Peele, the sketch show.
4428520	4429520	And I was writing a sketch.
4429520	4430520	Thank you.
4430520	4432520	More for Key than for Peele.
4433520	4436520	I was writing a sketch that I think didn't end up being on the show.
4436520	4437520	Or maybe it will be.
4437520	4438520	I don't know.
4438520	4441520	But because I was writing this sketch,
4441520	4442520	I was doing a little research.
4442520	4444520	And I was Googling.
4444520	4448520	How much does it cost to buy a nuclear warhead?
4450520	4452520	It's coming up with the price of nuclear war.
4452520	4453520	How much?
4453520	4455520	Black market nuclear war.
4455520	4458520	And I'm Googling all this stuff very specifically.
4458520	4462520	And then I got really paranoid and nervous about it.
4462520	4465520	In that same don't make a joke in the airport kind of a way.
4465520	4468520	My Google search history is now someone trying really hard
4468520	4471520	to get his hands on a nuclear warhead.
4472520	4475520	So then I just Googled, I am a comedy writer
4475520	4481520	in the hopes that whoever was looking through the search
4481520	4483520	would be like, oh, OK.
4483520	4486520	They're like, this guy's ready to pop.
4488520	4491520	If you had said I'm a senator, they'd be like, maybe he's...
4494520	4495520	You know what?
4495520	4498520	I'm in this habit of then we play D&D and then we do the thing.
4498520	4501520	But you just played D&D out abroad.
4501520	4502520	There's nobody.
4502520	4503520	The regulars aren't here.
4503520	4507520	I think you expressed to me a very intense interest
4507520	4510520	in taking a break from D&D this week.
4511520	4512520	I might have said something.
4512520	4515520	I mean, I don't know how intense that interest was.
4516520	4518520	It was when we were doing the D&D thing.
4518520	4520520	It was pretty much completely improvised, though.
4520520	4522520	It was like a weird, weird thing.
4522520	4525520	You know, those guys, they have a podcast.
4525520	4528520	If you want to know what I was up to this weekend,
4528520	4530520	they'll start podcasting it.
4530520	4532520	I think one of them drops on Monday.
4532520	4535520	Do they have a live video stream with like eight cameras?
4535520	4536520	No.
4537520	4539520	I wouldn't even say there's sound in the system.
4539520	4541520	Well, maybe it'll work out for them.
4543520	4546520	Well, would you be interested in...
4546520	4550520	First of all, I want to meet a guest.
4550520	4552520	It's a tradition that I've come to like.
4552520	4556520	I want to meet somebody who's never come to Harman Town before.
4556520	4558520	Maybe somebody that's come from far away.
4558520	4560520	Is anybody like...
4562520	4564520	Did you say Havana?
4564520	4565520	Atlanta.
4566520	4568520	Okay, we got Atlanta, D.C.
4568520	4570520	I heard of Milwaukee.
4570520	4571520	What did you say, ma'am?
4572520	4574520	Hold on, sorry, let me hear her first.
4575520	4576520	Washington State.
4576520	4578520	Westwood, yes.
4579520	4581520	Going to Universal City tomorrow.
4581520	4583520	This guy's going to Universal City.
4583520	4584520	Indiana.
4584520	4585520	What'd you say?
4585520	4586520	Indiana.
4586520	4587520	Indiana.
4587520	4588520	England.
4588520	4589520	England.
4589520	4593520	I mean, it seemed kind of bellicose and bad news.
4593520	4595520	He's trying to win.
4596520	4598520	It also didn't sound like he had a British accent.
4598520	4600520	Well, I mean, that goes without saying.
4601520	4602520	English person.
4602520	4603520	England.
4603520	4605520	Yeah, he would have been like...
4605520	4608520	How do you yell England in a British accent?
4608520	4611520	Well, I don't do accent words.
4612520	4613520	See, no, I think you just...
4613520	4614520	It sounds like that problem.
4614520	4615520	You might be right.
4615520	4617520	Sorry, British.
4618520	4619520	Sorry, British.
4620520	4623520	Hey, English guy, what's your name?
4624520	4625520	Neil.
4625520	4627520	Are you English?
4627520	4628520	Yeah?
4628520	4630520	Okay, that yes was really wrong.
4630520	4631520	Neil was...
4632520	4634520	Do you want to come up here for a second?
4636520	4637520	Yeah?
4637520	4638520	Go on then.
4640520	4641520	Go for it.
4641520	4642520	Is he coming?
4642520	4643520	Okay.
4643520	4646520	Let's meet a foreign friend.
4646520	4647520	Yay.
4650520	4651520	Hi, Neil.
4652520	4653520	Nice to meet you.
4653520	4654520	I'm sorry.
4654520	4655520	So, grab any one of these.
4655520	4656520	It's fine.
4656520	4659520	Sorry about the smell of me.
4659520	4662520	I bought a new shirt today and everything, but it was like,
4662520	4664520	I'm going through some stuff.
4665520	4668520	You look a little bit like George Clooney.
4668520	4669520	Yeah.
4669520	4670520	Thank you very much.
4670520	4671520	Sure.
4671520	4672520	This is a good podcast.
4672520	4675520	It's a good video stream guest.
4675520	4678520	Nobody thinks he looks like George Clooney.
4678520	4681520	Like, put your hands so that cover his...
4681520	4683520	Close your eyes.
4683520	4686520	Hey, sorry for doubting your Britishness.
4686520	4687520	That's okay.
4687520	4689520	I'm sorry for them doubting your George Clooney-ness.
4689520	4692520	It was actually a gentleman in the back who shouted on our behalf.
4692520	4694520	Oh, you're here with a whole gaggle of...
4694520	4695520	No, just my wife.
4695520	4696520	Oh, okay.
4696520	4698520	So, some random guy...
4698520	4700520	Yeah, some guy just kind of volunteered.
4700520	4702520	A guy knew you were English and did that.
4702520	4704520	Yeah, people do that in audiences.
4704520	4706520	They volunteer other people.
4706520	4708520	I go like, pick Kevin!
4708520	4710520	Because it's like they have this urge to...
4710520	4712520	They want to impact the show.
4712520	4713520	Yeah.
4713520	4715520	Which is neither good or bad.
4715520	4716520	But it's...
4716520	4717520	Yeah, that's cowardly.
4719520	4721520	Or it could be really supportive.
4721520	4722520	It could be like...
4723520	4725520	This guy's so British, you have no idea!
4726520	4728520	He's the hero!
4728520	4732520	Just to be clear, the person who said England did not say it with the British accent?
4732520	4734520	He didn't say it with the British accent.
4734520	4735520	Alright!
4735520	4737520	Thanks, Scott, thank you.
4737520	4739520	Thank you.
4739520	4741520	I secede that point.
4741520	4744520	Alright, Neil, so you're visiting LA for what reason?
4744520	4746520	We're on holiday at the moment.
4746520	4747520	Really?
4747520	4748520	Yeah.
4748520	4750520	That means vacation.
4751520	4752520	I was gonna say, there's no...
4752520	4754520	I didn't approve of any holiday.
4754520	4756520	My empire.
4756520	4758520	Did we bomb someone today?
4759520	4763520	Yeah, so is that just how your vacation hours lined up at work?
4763520	4766520	You just literally just took a vacation?
4766520	4767520	Yeah, we came over.
4767520	4770520	We've actually been over before to Hormontown.
4770520	4772520	Came over at Christmas time.
4772520	4773520	A real holiday.
4773520	4775520	When you were sick from Britain.
4775520	4776520	Oh, yeah, yeah.
4776520	4777520	Oh, God.
4777520	4779520	Someone in Scotland that got me sick.
4779520	4780520	He was high-fiving my kilt.
4780520	4783520	He had Scottish germs all over him.
4783520	4785520	But I think they're a wonderful people.
4785520	4788520	Obviously, they're like Braveheart.
4788520	4789520	But they're so robust.
4789520	4794520	I think that the things on their hands could kill an American.
4794520	4799520	Yeah, so I don't blame you guys for oppressing them.
4801520	4803520	They volunteered now to be oppressed.
4803520	4804520	I know.
4804520	4807520	Did they vote it down, the independence thing?
4807520	4808520	I was over there for the holidays.
4808520	4810520	That was the big news over there.
4810520	4813520	The ongoing thing was like this upcoming independence thing.
4813520	4815520	And then I saw that it was coming up for vote.
4815520	4817520	And there was a lot of confusion over there.
4817520	4823520	It was sort of like it's an exciting idea, but it's kind of like a lot of people couldn't really...
4823520	4827520	Whenever you had a practical conversation about what independent Scotland represented,
4827520	4829520	it sort of got very tricky very quickly.
4829520	4831520	Are you going to take out your own garbage?
4831520	4836520	Well, they got quite scared because I think we said they couldn't have the pound.
4836520	4837520	Right.
4837520	4841520	And they were like, we don't want to be independent from the money everyone uses.
4841520	4843520	They basically said we thought we would still use it.
4843520	4845520	And we kind of went, well...
4845520	4848520	They were going to try to use both the pound and the euro?
4848520	4850520	And you guys were going to take the pound away?
4850520	4852520	No, you can't have the pound anywhere.
4852520	4854520	We're taking our ball back.
4854520	4858520	We can put a Scottish detecting microchip in our money.
4858520	4864520	And if you use it in Scotland, it'll turn into a spider and sew your mouth shut.
4864520	4869520	And it'll put a sarcastic crown on your head and then explode.
4869520	4872520	Spider egg crown.
4872520	4875520	Because they have that old spider thing.
4875520	4876520	Yes.
4876520	4877520	On their money.
4877520	4878520	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4878520	4879520	They have regular...
4879520	4881520	Scotland is like the spider thing.
4881520	4882520	What?
4882520	4883520	Is this an actual spider thing?
4883520	4885520	There was some guy in the George Washington of Scotland.
4885520	4888520	He watched a spider make a web before he...
4888520	4890520	It's not exactly crossing the Delaware.
4890520	4896520	I'm kidding.
4896520	4898520	I don't know why I have to say I'm kidding.
4898520	4901520	I'm not some jingoistic, like, ah, that's a funny comedy.
4901520	4906520	I don't know how George Washington is better than some guy named Mick Stevenson.
4906520	4908520	There's a spider on their money.
4908520	4911520	And the spider is like a Scottish thing because he...
4911520	4912520	But I asked...
4912520	4916520	Aaron's retelling of the story.
4916520	4918520	There's two Americans having breakfast.
4918520	4919520	And I was like, what is the spider thing?
4919520	4923520	And Aaron said, like, yeah, this guy, they were having a war.
4923520	4926520	And he ran away for a while.
4926520	4928520	And he went into a cave.
4928520	4933520	And then he watched a spider build a web.
4933520	4934520	But the rock was slippery.
4934520	4936520	So he was like, well, if he can do that.
4936520	4939520	And then he went back to the war and it went better.
4939520	4943520	I was like, that cannot be the real story.
4943520	4946520	But I think it was more like he was...
4946520	4948520	He was in that cave for a brave reason.
4948520	4953520	And the web was a way of measuring time.
4953520	4956520	Well, it's kind of similar to Spencer's story in a way.
4956520	4957520	Slippery bathroom.
4957520	4958520	Yeah, yeah.
4958520	4959520	Yeah.
4959520	4961520	If Spencer can get high in a moss lined...
4961520	4963520	And any of us can do anything.
4963520	4964520	Sorry.
4964520	4967520	I didn't mean to interrogate you about Scottish history.
4967520	4969520	It's like, I don't know much about it.
4969520	4970520	It's a nice sign.
4970520	4974520	Even though it's eight miles from your house.
4975520	4980520	I don't know anything about any of a lot of you.
4980520	4984520	I know you all have too many different accents for a tiny little place.
4984520	4987520	I don't understand how you can talk so different.
4987520	4989520	It doesn't make any sense.
4989520	4992520	I guess because in ancient times, if you walked six blocks,
4992520	4994520	it was like it took longer.
4994520	4997520	I think it's because there's a lot of mountains.
4997520	4999520	And the fact we've been invaded by a lot of people.
4999520	5000520	Yeah, so you'd be like,
5000520	5004520	Hello, I'm going to climb over that hill.
5004520	5005520	I'll see you later, Fred.
5005520	5008520	Yes, we'll see you at the holiday when we talk exactly the same.
5008520	5009520	Very well.
5009520	5010520	Cheerio.
5011520	5013520	Oh, fuck this fucking hill.
5013520	5015520	Oh, fuck my hill.
5015520	5017520	Fucking god damn it.
5017520	5019520	Oh, oh, oh, oh, fucking down.
5019520	5020520	Can't forget I don't talk.
5020520	5021520	Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.
5021520	5024520	Oh, fuck, I can't remember how I used to talk.
5027520	5029520	Let's just have a bunch of fucking babies then.
5031520	5034520	And daddy, what's over that hill?
5034520	5035520	Fuck you.
5035520	5038520	We're going over to find out, you fucking cocksuck fuckfess.
5041520	5043520	Five hundred years later.
5043520	5044520	Hello.
5050520	5052520	What the fuck are you saying?
5052520	5057520	It's your own little spider.
5057520	5060520	It's your own little spider.
5061520	5063520	Jesus Christ.
5065520	5067520	Something like that.
5067520	5069520	I imagine that's how language.
5069520	5071520	That's like sort of roughly how it went.
5071520	5072520	Yeah.
5072520	5076520	All right, so let me throw this out to you, Spencer, okay?
5076520	5077520	Okay.
5078520	5083520	Because the people are addicted to a kind of like narrative cap that we put on the show.
5084520	5085520	Are they?
5086520	5087520	Yeah.
5089520	5090520	See?
5091520	5096520	If you had the excuse that you were only doing it because I was putting you on the spot,
5096520	5101520	and you weren't supposed to be good at it, and it was all my fault, so anything that went wrong,
5101520	5106520	you could blame me, and you don't have to want to do it, you don't even have to say yes,
5106520	5107520	I'll make you do it.
5108520	5118520	Would you improvise dungeon mastering for a new kind of game set in outer space
5120520	5123520	where we're like space people,
5126520	5134520	and we don't have character sheets, and you just kind of like, you tell us what we can and cannot do.
5135520	5139520	Like, you know, like we're six, and we're on a spaceship.
5140520	5141520	I like it.
5141520	5145520	And then we say, I'm going to do this, and then you're like, that's your turn, and you roll a die,
5145520	5148520	and you're like, well, that's a high number, I bet you got that nailed.
5149520	5151520	That's vaguely fake.
5152520	5156520	But it's in space, so it's still magical.
5157520	5159520	Well, wait, wait, it's magical?
5159520	5163520	Well, it's, I mean, it's saying it's like trope driven.
5163520	5165520	Yeah, yeah, it's like trope driven.
5165520	5171520	It's like you can make shit up, and it doesn't have to be like, wait, you said 3rd Street, then, you know.
5171520	5173520	Yeah, I mean, I'm down.
5174520	5175520	All right.
5175520	5177520	Should we get some estrogen up here?
5177520	5178520	Sure, yeah.
5178520	5179520	That's a weird way to put it.
5179520	5181520	I don't know why I asked Rubens.
5181520	5183520	Isn't that a better way of putting it than?
5185520	5189520	You're reducing a gender to a chemical.
5190520	5192520	But in a lot of ways that's very progressive.
5193520	5196520	Do you think it's progressive that I based it on a chemical?
5197520	5199520	Okay, all right, fine.
5203520	5210520	I mean, I would say that's very womanly, but that would be horrible.
5213520	5214520	Yay!
5214520	5215520	We did it.
5215520	5216520	What's your name?
5216520	5217520	I'm Stacy.
5217520	5218520	Stacy.
5218520	5219520	I'm Washington.
5219520	5220520	Stacy from Washington, okay.
5220520	5221520	Hey, guys.
5221520	5222520	All right.
5222520	5224520	Before we start, can I tell you something really funny?
5224520	5225520	Yes.
5225520	5226520	Okay.
5226520	5227520	I just have to do this.
5227520	5232520	So, I, too, had to buy a sweatshirt, and I was thinking about it while I was getting ready,
5232520	5234520	and it's an island of Southern California.
5234520	5235520	You can't see what I am.
5235520	5237520	I swear I saw that one.
5237520	5238520	Where were you?
5238520	5239520	Target.
5239520	5240520	Oh, okay.
5240520	5241520	It's probably just one of them.
5241520	5242520	Anyway, well, you wouldn't get this color.
5242520	5243520	I mean...
5243520	5244520	I almost...
5244520	5246520	I was like, well, I should just commit to what's happening here.
5246520	5249520	Yeah, I think it's better on me, but it's cool.
5249520	5250520	And then the next one...
5251520	5256520	The next funny thing is, there must be a hypnotist in the audience.
5256520	5258520	Well, there probably is one.
5258520	5259520	No, there really is.
5259520	5263520	It was hilarious, because it made it that much funnier, because he was like...
5263520	5267520	They were out of control, and we're right behind, and he's just like...
5267520	5268520	Oh, he was angry?
5268520	5269520	He was upset about that?
5269520	5270520	I mean, it was kind of...
5270520	5271520	There was a little anger.
5271520	5272520	I was a little indignity.
5272520	5273520	I mean, there was...
5273520	5274520	Oh!
5274520	5277520	There was an indignity hypnotist.
5278520	5281520	Well, can I say one thing before we bring him up?
5281520	5284520	Which I think is only fair to let him know.
5284520	5286520	And obviously, I know the rest of you know it.
5286520	5289520	But when I snap my fingers, you're going to remember you're not a hypnotist.
5293520	5295520	Thank you very much, Troy.
5295520	5296520	All right, are you coming up?
5296520	5297520	He's coming up.
5297520	5298520	He's got a Pac-Man shirt.
5298520	5300520	He's going to gobble up our time pellets.
5300520	5302520	And it just made it so much better.
5302520	5303520	Okay.
5303520	5304520	All right.
5304520	5305520	Free for all.
5305520	5306520	Hypnotist is coming up.
5307520	5309520	It's getting hotter and hotter in here.
5309520	5310520	I like it.
5310520	5312520	I like the Pac-Man shirt.
5312520	5313520	Thank you.
5313520	5314520	Oh, and it says, no, no, no.
5314520	5315520	Oh, thank you.
5315520	5316520	Hello, sir.
5316520	5317520	What's your name?
5317520	5318520	My name is James.
5318520	5319520	James?
5319520	5320520	All right.
5320520	5321520	You can move that.
5321520	5322520	Let's just sit on my stuff.
5322520	5323520	All right.
5323520	5324520	James the Hypnotist.
5324520	5325520	Where are you from?
5325520	5330520	I am from Tustin, behind the orange curtain, as it's called, up here.
5330520	5331520	Okay.
5331520	5332520	Do you know any canyoneers?
5332520	5335520	I think that's where canyoneers are from, isn't it?
5335520	5336520	Canyoneers.
5336520	5337520	All right.
5337520	5338520	Never mind.
5338520	5339520	So, all right.
5339520	5341520	So, you're a hypnotist.
5341520	5342520	I do have a caveat.
5342520	5343520	I'm a hypnotherapist.
5343520	5344520	Oh.
5344520	5345520	I do real hypnotherapy.
5345520	5347520	But that's not trick hypnotism.
5347520	5348520	Yeah.
5348520	5350520	You don't perform at the ice house in Pasadena.
5350520	5353520	I wasn't doing an impression of guys that help people.
5353520	5354520	I mean, yes.
5354520	5357520	Yes, I am a hypnotist.
5357520	5360520	All the way from the land of Tarzana.
5360520	5361520	Boy.
5361520	5363520	I thought it was Tustin.
5363520	5364520	Yeah.
5364520	5366520	I think your anger was a little too much.
5366520	5367520	Misguided.
5367520	5368520	As was your bringing him up.
5368520	5369520	Well, let's see.
5369520	5370520	You saw my fault, guys.
5370520	5372520	This guy totally made me look like him.
5372520	5374520	Well, maybe he has a defense.
5374520	5377520	Maybe he has, like, some reason he'd like to share with us, you know?
5377520	5380520	A reason for wanting to be up here?
5380520	5382520	Whatever.
5382520	5383520	Spencer.
5383520	5385520	My love is not enough.
5385520	5387520	So, what's your defense?
5387520	5388520	Well, no.
5388520	5390520	Because all of them are thinking, I'll be on stage, too.
5390520	5391520	Fuck it.
5391520	5392520	Like, that's the problem.
5392520	5393520	I mean, there's cameras now.
5393520	5395520	Now everyone wants it.
5395520	5398520	Well, there are a lot of bad hypnotists in the world.
5398520	5399520	Uh-huh.
5399520	5400520	Not, like, good and evil.
5400520	5405520	Just, like, skill-wise, very, very untalented hypnotist.
5405520	5410520	So, you're just saying that his was just a one-off, and it's not indicative.
5410520	5413520	It's very possible not to put words in your mouth.
5413520	5415520	Well, like, indicative.
5415520	5416520	Sure.
5416520	5417520	Yeah.
5417520	5418520	Okay.
5418520	5421520	I bet that guy was a shitty hypnotist, I think.
5421520	5422520	Probably was.
5422520	5424520	That's what Dan was saying.
5424520	5425520	Right?
5425520	5426520	Yeah.
5426520	5427520	Yeah, I think.
5427520	5428520	Cool.
5428520	5429520	The space.
5429520	5430520	The space.
5430520	5431520	All right.
5431520	5438520	So, can you make us feel less awkward?
5438520	5439520	Aye.
5439520	5442520	Yeah, it's called Kettle One.
5442520	5444520	It's right here next to you.
5444520	5445520	All right.
5445520	5446520	Yes, I'll take that.
5446520	5447520	No, tell us.
5447520	5448520	Ah!
5448520	5452520	How, in the psychological community...
5452520	5455520	In the psychological community, yes.
5455520	5458520	I'm not hypnotizing you.
5458520	5460520	You who I'm touching right now, you're about to ask me a question.
5460520	5462520	That question is now going to be...
5462520	5463520	I don't get it.
5463520	5467520	How highly regarded is hypnotherapy?
5467520	5468520	Is it...
5468520	5469520	It's great.
5469520	5474520	In a psychological profession, most psychotherapists or psychiatrists go to, like, a weekend seminar,
5474520	5476520	and now they're hypnotists.
5476520	5477520	It's great.
5477520	5478520	Fully trained.
5478520	5479520	It's great.
5479520	5480520	It's a great profession.
5480520	5482520	And you did more than that?
5482520	5485520	Well, I studied hypnotherapy for a year in Tarzana.
5485520	5486520	That's why.
5486520	5487520	Shout it out.
5487520	5488520	Tarzana?
5488520	5491520	My brother got hypnotherapy, and it's crazy.
5491520	5492520	It really changed his life.
5492520	5498520	He went from being, like, a kind of punk kid to, like, a crazy-ass bodybuilder with all
5498520	5500520	this drive and devotion and stuff.
5500520	5501520	It's amazing.
5501520	5503520	But he still smokes cigarettes.
5503520	5505520	He doesn't, you know?
5505520	5508520	He stopped smoking, you know, drugs and stuff.
5508520	5509520	Is that what he went for?
5509520	5510520	Yeah, yeah.
5510520	5514520	This guy that was his hypnotherapist, he actually studied in India.
5514520	5516520	They're under, like, gurus and shit.
5516520	5519520	Like, it was some crazy-ass bidness.
5519520	5520520	That may be a cult.
5520520	5522520	You might want to talk to him.
5522520	5524520	If it worked for him, I mean, sign me up.
5524520	5526520	I'll drink whatever Kool-Aid.
5526520	5529520	You know, it was flavor-aid.
5529520	5531520	It wasn't Kool-Aid.
5531520	5536520	I told this story before, I know it, about Shrab went to a hypnotherapist, and that's
5536520	5540520	what that community story was based on, with Pierce Tries Hypnotherapy on Brita, because
5540520	5542520	there's a real story from Shrab about him.
5542520	5544520	He went to this guy, and the guy gave him this tape.
5544520	5545520	He was like, I made this tape.
5545520	5546520	You can take it home.
5546520	5547520	You lay down, relax.
5547520	5549520	It'll be me talking.
5549520	5551520	It'll help you be more secure and stuff.
5551520	5554520	And he played the tape, and it was like he...
5554520	5557520	The guy was like, you know, you can hear his screen door opening and his wife's putting
5557520	5559520	away groceries, his dog's barking.
5559520	5561520	He's like, this guy's pretty bad.
5561520	5564520	And then he went in for an in-person session, and Rob...
5564520	5569520	He put Rob under, and Rob was like me at the Pasadena Ice House, was like, okay, I'll be
5569520	5570520	under.
5570520	5574520	And then the guy fell down and hurt his leg, and Rob...
5574520	5581520	Rob pretended to stay hypnotized, because he didn't want the guy to be holding his leg
5581520	5586520	in pain, and then have Rob wake up and go, oh, let me call the doctor.
5586520	5590520	And the guy would be like, ow, my leg hurts, and you were faking!
5590520	5593520	I'm a bad hypnotherapist!
5593520	5596520	Which wouldn't have happened, because if a person hurts their leg in the room, it should
5596520	5597520	probably snap you out of it, right?
5597520	5599520	It's not supposed to be magical.
5599520	5602520	So he kind of actually did the opposite there by pretending to...
5602520	5604520	He's kind of like, okay.
5604520	5607520	I'm gonna die, and I'm just too good a hypnotist.
5607520	5609520	I'm gonna die, and nobody's gonna help me.
5609520	5611520	Yeah, why didn't you just snap him out of it?
5611520	5613520	Why didn't you just say, snap out of this?
5613520	5618520	When I snap my fingers, you will get me to the hospital.
5618520	5619520	I don't know.
5619520	5622520	It's a really useful ability in that case, I think.
5622520	5625520	All right, so that was, you know, we did good with you, right?
5625520	5627520	Why, I like to think so.
5627520	5630520	All right, well, let's have a hand for the hypnotherapist guy.
5630520	5632520	Thank you, everybody.
5632520	5637520	That means I'm gonna make you disappear.
5638520	5640520	You're supposed to...
5643520	5646520	And now, when I snap my fingers, I will...
5648520	5650520	Let's give him a hand, everybody.
5653520	5655520	You see that, Rubens?
5655520	5659520	I mean, it seems like a bit that he could not take a suggestion, right?
5662520	5664520	I'm not even supposed to be that good at it.
5664520	5667520	He's trained highly to resist suggestions.
5667520	5668520	Oh, that's what it is.
5668520	5670520	It's like bouncing off of him, because he's like armor-plated.
5670520	5671520	Okay.
5671520	5675520	Spencer, when you said you see that, Rubens, were you criticizing my comptroller?
5675520	5676520	It was a little dig, yeah.
5676520	5677520	I mean, you're doing fine.
5677520	5679520	I don't usually get digs from Spencer.
5679520	5682520	Yeah, I mean, this is my element, if I could be said to have one.
5682520	5683520	Wait, once he's supposed to...
5683520	5685520	Do you think that was on him?
5685520	5686520	It could have been on him.
5686520	5687520	Oh, no.
5687520	5688520	Come on.
5688520	5689520	I make these people come up here.
5689520	5690520	Will you talk about Spencer and me for a second?
5690520	5691520	Sure.
5691520	5692520	Do you have time?
5692520	5693520	I love this guy.
5693520	5694520	This guy is one of my favorite employees.
5694520	5695520	Thank you.
5695520	5696520	Spencer...
5696520	5697520	I'm one of Spencer's employees.
5697520	5698520	Yeah.
5698520	5702520	And Spencer and I get along great, but he did once say that he thinks I might be a monster.
5702520	5703520	Yeah.
5703520	5704520	Well, I don't...
5704520	5705520	Well, so...
5705520	5709520	I mean, I'm sure the podcast listeners are familiar with Matt Roller.
5709520	5710520	Yeah!
5710520	5711520	Yeah.
5711520	5712520	No, no.
5712520	5713520	I knew you wouldn't.
5713520	5715520	But he also...
5715520	5717520	He's got an edgy kind of...
5717520	5719520	He might be on the edge kind of thing.
5719520	5720520	He's meaner than I am.
5720520	5721520	I don't think I've got that meanness.
5721520	5722520	Yeah.
5722520	5723520	That's the thing.
5723520	5724520	That's what it is.
5724520	5728920	It's like, that's the guy that you see at two in the morning and then you look away
5728920	5731520	and then you see him again and he's way closer to you.
5731520	5732520	Yeah.
5732520	5733520	Yeah.
5733520	5734520	He'll do that.
5734520	5736080	He's got a smile, but he's also got a straight razor.
5736080	5737080	Yeah.
5737080	5738080	He's a little terrifying.
5738080	5739080	Yeah.
5739080	5744600	It's that exact charm that you possess that makes you seem like...
5744600	5746840	Matt Roller is too obvious.
5746840	5749120	You think that I'm a smoother Matt Roller?
5749120	5750960	Well, in that sense, yeah.
5750960	5755000	If he was actually doing that, I think he'd tone it down more, you know?
5755000	5756000	Like because you're always...
5756000	5758520	Oh, I'm scarier than him because it seems like I'm...
5758520	5761440	Because you could be putting it on because you're so charming.
5761440	5763240	Well, that's nice.
5763240	5764240	Thank you.
5764240	5769680	I think, honestly, what you're detecting is that as, I think, is to some extent true
5769680	5771000	of all of us.
5771000	5772000	All of my charm...
5772000	5773000	Your two penises.
5773000	5774000	Yeah.
5774000	5775000	We all have multiple...
5775000	5776320	I mean, men have two penises.
5776320	5777320	Women have one.
5777320	5778320	And...
5778320	5779320	No, but...
5779680	5781680	I told him that, LaGrina.
5781680	5787960	Let's just get through this tonight and go home and Google the fuck out of him.
5787960	5792000	I think you're detecting the artifice over my extreme discomfort, not the artifice over
5792000	5793000	my psychotic...
5793000	5794000	Yeah.
5794000	5795000	He's a very...
5795000	5796000	Yeah, but I mean, it's the same thing.
5796000	5797720	I'm the same way when I'm...
5797720	5798720	Oh.
5798720	5799720	Yeah.
5799720	5802400	It's very uncomfortable when I'm trying not to like serial kill.
5802400	5804400	Yeah, but you don't...
5804400	5805800	When you're trying not to?
5805800	5806800	Yeah.
5806800	5808200	Well, that's what the artifice is for.
5808200	5809640	No, it's not the same thing.
5809640	5811720	I think that's not what I was saying.
5811720	5812720	No.
5812720	5813720	Whatever.
5813720	5814720	I think that...
5814720	5815720	All right.
5815720	5816720	No, I don't want to talk about it.
5816720	5817720	All right.
5817720	5818720	Well, okay.
5818720	5819720	I think that...
5819720	5821080	We'll talk tomorrow, Spencer.
5821080	5822080	I'm glad.
5822080	5828520	I think that Rubens and I share a desire to undo our discomfort by making it other people's
5828520	5829520	problem.
5829520	5831680	Like, getting their feedback, their reaction.
5831680	5834120	I don't think of it that way, but I probably do, do that.
5834120	5835600	I probably put that in a very negative way.
5835600	5843200	Like, we're wiping our asses on other people, but like, if we could get everybody to sign
5843200	5846560	off on us, I think we'd sleep a little easier than Spencer would.
5846560	5852080	I think people sign off on Spencer really more than they should, and he doesn't help
5852080	5853080	him sleep at night.
5853080	5855360	He goes to bed and goes like, why are they signing off on me?
5855360	5856960	I should kill them.
5856960	5857960	Yeah.
5857960	5858960	It's fucked up, man.
5858960	5859960	It's hard to deal with.
5859960	5860960	I don't get it.
5860960	5861960	Yeah.
5861960	5866600	If I got through the day and everybody was like, you are doing all right, like, first
5866600	5869440	of all, I would have tried to figure out how I wasn't.
5869440	5872320	Like, I'd find the guy that said I wasn't.
5872320	5876520	But if I exhausted all those options, I would go to bed and I'd be like, yeah, I nailed
5876520	5878080	it for one day.
5878080	5879080	But I think, yeah.
5879080	5880080	It's so soundly.
5880080	5883600	I think it's arguably more honest of you to be like, I don't know the fuck if people like
5883600	5884600	me.
5884600	5887200	Well, if someone said like, you did a good job or whatever, I'd be like, were you watching
5887200	5888200	me?
5888200	5889200	Yeah.
5889200	5890200	They're not so trusted.
5890200	5891680	They're not going to be instantly suspicious.
5891680	5893400	Like, that's how I am with praise.
5893400	5895760	It's like, well, wait, what do you want from me?
5895760	5896760	Yeah.
5896760	5897760	Stacey said, I love you.
5897760	5898760	She leaned over and said, I love you.
5898760	5899760	Yeah.
5899760	5900760	And yeah.
5900760	5901760	Well, what do you think that's supposed to mean?
5901760	5902760	Yeah, exactly.
5902760	5904160	What makes me wonder what's wrong?
5904160	5905160	Yeah.
5905160	5906160	That's what I'm saying.
5906160	5907160	All right.
5907160	5908480	She's got an ulterior motive in her heart.
5908480	5909880	I'm not a serial killer.
5909880	5910880	It's cool.
5910880	5912400	Oh, I mean, that's that's off the table.
5912400	5917600	Well, it was until just then or am I?
5917600	5918600	Yeah.
5918600	5919600	See, that's what I'm saying.
5920000	5921000	It's mysterious.
5921000	5922000	It is.
5922000	5924560	Well, now I'm starting now.
5924560	5928280	Now I'm feeling you're not so dangerous as I'm a lot safer.
5928280	5929280	Well, that's good.
5929280	5940000	Because she's playing the the space engineer, which is sort of a druid type character in
5940000	5943440	our new sci-fi game.
5943440	5944440	Space Katiers.
5944440	5949280	There's some music for Spencer.
5949280	5951280	It doesn't have to be space oriented.
5951280	5952280	Nope.
5952280	5956280	There's no you need a.
5956280	5957280	You need a minute.
5957280	5958280	Let's.
5958280	5959280	We don't need that.
5959280	5960280	Here.
5960280	5961280	I'm going to need audience.
5961280	5962280	I'll do it.
5962280	5963280	I'll do it.
5963280	5964280	I'll do it.
5964280	5975280	That's your music for you starting to narrate the circumstances that we're starting in.
5975280	5976280	All right.
5976280	5979120	Well, I'm going to I'm going to point out to the audience when I need like a mad
5979120	5980360	libs kind of fill in.
5980360	5982360	Does that make sense?
5982360	5984560	So a drift in space.
5984560	5986360	The starship.
5986360	5988360	Okay.
5988360	5989360	More people.
5989360	5991360	We need more participation than this.
5991360	5995880	This is a golden opportunity.
5995880	5998960	These golden opportunity.
5998960	6008920	The SS golden opportunity is a drift in space piloted by.
6008920	6012080	Lady Gaga.
6012080	6031320	Her trusty Android Margaret Thatcher assisted by space engineer Janine as well as the young
6031320	6034320	upstart.
6034320	6045360	You regain consciousness after the gas disperses.
6045360	6046360	There's gas.
6046360	6048200	You notice as you regain consciousness.
6048200	6054480	Oh, oh, I'm Lady Gaga.
6054480	6059520	I can't believe I don't remember what happened.
6059520	6061520	Damage report.
6062520	6063520	It's quite bad.
6063520	6064520	What?
6064520	6065520	What?
6065520	6070840	There's a big hole in the spacecraft.
6070840	6076360	It's kind of leaking in some kind of space.
6076360	6077360	The gas.
6077360	6084480	The gas was definitely yellow and you're awake.
6084480	6086640	And you're Jacqueline or Daphne?
6086640	6087640	What was your?
6087640	6088640	I think it was Margaret Thatcher.
6088640	6089640	Margaret Thatcher.
6089640	6100160	Were any of those things you were explaining like inside British politics jokes or?
6100160	6101160	No.
6101160	6102160	Would you like me to?
6102160	6103160	No, no, no, no.
6103160	6104160	I'll be lost.
6104160	6107480	I just so much so that I thought that might have been I was like, it's like, is that why
6107480	6108480	they were?
6108480	6109480	Yeah.
6109480	6110480	The yellow gas one.
6110480	6111480	Yeah.
6111480	6112480	Is that?
6112480	6113480	It's like a reference to like Bristol.
6113480	6114480	Yeah.
6114480	6115480	Yeah.
6115480	6116480	To the hill and the accent.
6116480	6118200	It's Ed Miliband's nickname.
6118200	6120960	Everyone got that in Britain.
6120960	6123600	I examine my surroundings.
6123600	6124600	It's a spaceship.
6124600	6126440	The spaceship you know and love.
6126440	6129080	The SS Golden Opportunity.
6129080	6134000	It does have a large hole in it, but you can see life support has already deployed a nano
6134000	6137700	web that's keeping the pressure stabilized.
6137700	6142680	Yellow gas is indeed leaking and you think it might be some of the quasar fluid that
6142680	6145120	powers the rear engine.
6145120	6147840	Not the side and turning engines though.
6148480	6149480	I'll go check guys.
6149480	6150480	I'll go check.
6150480	6151480	You're going to check the nano fluid?
6151480	6152480	Yeah.
6152480	6153480	I'm kind of tired.
6153480	6154480	I'm from the gas.
6154480	6160880	I mean, I'm not going to promise anything right now.
6160880	6161880	Are you?
6161880	6162880	I can't remember.
6162880	6163880	Janine.
6163880	6164880	Janine.
6164880	6165880	What's Janine?
6165880	6167880	Have we not been on this flight together?
6167880	6169760	No, just the gas like affected me.
6169760	6171280	I think all of our heads are a little.
6171280	6172280	Oh, right.
6172280	6173280	You're fine.
6173280	6174280	Fine.
6174280	6175280	I get it.
6175280	6176280	Yeah.
6176280	6178280	And below you determine.
6178280	6179280	Shit.
6179280	6189280	Well, as the the young upstart of the ship, right, is that what I am?
6189280	6190280	Yeah.
6190280	6193720	I'd like to just assert that this is a time for change in leadership.
6193720	6194720	Whoa.
6194720	6197280	This is a time when clearly something was mismanaged.
6197280	6199280	Gaga is the leader, right?
6199280	6200280	Jesus Christ.
6200280	6202320	Well, I'm a young, I don't take it personally.
6202320	6203320	I'm an upstart.
6203320	6204320	What's your name?
6204320	6205320	Alf.
6206320	6207320	I'm Alf.
6207320	6208320	Yeah.
6209320	6216320	And it just seems to me that this is a good time to maybe reconsider the leadership.
6216320	6219320	And the.
6219320	6234320	Well, I just want to point out that I think if the new leader is going to be handling crisis crises well, they're not going to like, you know, do this kind of thing in the middle of a hole in our quasar fluid thing, you know, like you might be right.
6235320	6237320	We would find out later.
6237320	6240320	Well, it seems to me that someone's being defensive.
6242320	6245320	I'm I'm too I'm too confident in my leadership to deal with this.
6245320	6249320	So I I march straight to the medical chest.
6250320	6251320	Okay.
6251320	6262320	Flipping my hair over my shoulder, girding my loins within my nylon bodysuit.
6264320	6265320	I'm Lady Gaga.
6269320	6273320	The ship rocks with the impact of several particle beams.
6273320	6274320	Shit.
6274320	6277320	I think we've been hit by several particle beams.
6280320	6281320	He's right.
6281320	6285320	Well, maybe if we wait long enough, we'll vote for them to go away.
6285320	6287320	And I flip my hair.
6287320	6290320	I just aggressively flip my hair everywhere.
6290320	6294320	I say Lady Gaga is being snide, but I think this is a time for a vote.
6294320	6295320	We're under attack.
6295320	6297320	Jesus Christ.
6297320	6298320	This guy.
6298320	6299320	Weapons.
6299320	6301320	Weapon systems deploy.
6301320	6302320	Oh, sorry.
6302320	6303320	I don't want to cut you off.
6303320	6306320	No one of you knows how to use any weapon systems.
6307320	6309320	Oh, I guess the Android does.
6309320	6310320	It's programmed into him.
6310320	6312320	I'll push the red button.
6313320	6315320	The weapon systems deploy.
6317320	6318320	Nice.
6321320	6322320	In your face.
6322320	6323320	My face.
6323320	6324320	Yeah.
6325320	6328320	I think in a lot of ways I was responsible for that move.
6328320	6330320	Like you're not on our team right now.
6330320	6331320	Want to take a boat?
6332320	6333320	Just go for it.
6333320	6335320	Android, how do we find out who's attacking us?
6336320	6338320	We look through the window.
6342320	6343320	All right.
6345320	6348320	I look at Alpha and go, exactly.
6349320	6352320	And I flip my hair more and I look out a window.
6353320	6357320	You look at a window and you see what looks like a comet.
6357320	6358320	It is a comet.
6358320	6359320	A comet?
6359320	6360320	Yeah.
6360320	6364320	You don't know how that shot lasers or maybe the lasers came from some other direction
6364320	6365320	in some other window.
6365320	6367320	Is the comet moving?
6367320	6368320	Yeah, it's a comet.
6368320	6370320	But I mean, where's it going?
6370320	6371320	Where is it?
6371320	6374320	It's, you know, it's not really heading towards you.
6374320	6375320	It's space.
6375320	6376320	It's just comet.
6376320	6378320	It's not heading towards us.
6378320	6379320	No, it's just a comet.
6379320	6380320	Is it heading?
6380320	6381320	Is it far, far away?
6381320	6383320	I mean, yeah, it's pretty far.
6383320	6384320	I mean, are we moving?
6384320	6385320	Is it moving?
6385320	6386320	You're adrift in space.
6386320	6387320	So, yeah.
6387320	6388320	So it's probably going to be gone pretty soon.
6388320	6392320	Is it like the life force comet on the film Life Force?
6392320	6393320	I just watched that movie.
6393320	6395320	You don't know that off hand.
6396320	6398320	You'd have to censor it or something.
6399320	6400320	You don't know that?
6400320	6401320	Why doesn't he know that?
6401320	6402320	He's a robot.
6402320	6404320	He's probably programmed with Life Force's plot.
6405320	6410320	It's just not, you can't just sense whether or not something's like a Life Force-esque comet.
6410320	6413320	Well, Robot, tell us more about the film Life Force.
6413320	6416320	There's a lot of naked ladies in there.
6417320	6418320	Noice.
6422320	6424320	There's a lot of estrogen.
6427320	6428320	Go on.
6429320	6430320	What happened with the comet?
6431320	6434320	It hit London, and then some naked ladies in there.
6434320	6435320	Oh, is that why you guys are all into the movie?
6435320	6436320	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6436320	6437320	Oh, brother.
6439320	6442320	Can we run a diagnostic on the comet?
6442320	6443320	On the comet?
6443320	6444320	Yeah, yeah.
6445320	6447320	Everything sounds so officially spacey.
6449320	6454320	It's like cheating to do Space Improper, the British robot guy.
6456320	6457320	You want a diagnostic?
6457320	6459320	Like, you could have a 30 IQ for all we know.
6460320	6464320	I was like, oh, yes, of course we'll run a diagnostic.
6464320	6466320	Holy shit, don't blow up Alderaan.
6466320	6477320	So, you determined that this comet is made out of 80% ice and 7% carbon and, what was it,
6477320	6481320	13% high energy laser beam.
6482320	6484320	It's not the one from Life Force, then.
6484320	6485320	There's no naked ladies.
6485320	6486320	All right.
6487320	6489320	I don't remember this movie.
6490320	6492320	It wasn't like a naked lady comet.
6492320	6494320	Tobhooper, was it?
6494320	6495320	Tobhooper.
6495320	6498320	I think he just meant that was in the movie there was naked ladies.
6498320	6500320	They were just in the movie.
6500320	6505320	I think they did pick one key naked lady out of the comet.
6506320	6512320	It makes me so sad that in England, they just sit and wait for a movie in which London gets attacked,
6512320	6515320	and then they all go see it, and all they remember is the boobies.
6517320	6521320	It makes me think, you guys, I want to send you a cup of soup or something over there.
6522320	6523320	Thank you.
6523320	6525320	But it's too late because China took over.
6525320	6527320	I could have done something about this years ago.
6527320	6532320	Monster House could have been set in, I want to say Kensington?
6532320	6533320	Manchester.
6533320	6536320	It's a great place.
6536320	6539320	And I would have filled it with tits for you, bro.
6542320	6543320	Thank you.
6546320	6547320	All right.
6548320	6550320	The diagnostic was ran.
6550320	6553320	Yeah, I just want to point out that I feel like we're not being super efficient here.
6553320	6557320	I mean, you've got an Android talking about life force.
6557320	6560320	You've got an upstart challenging constantly.
6560320	6562320	I mean, this is a leadership failure.
6562320	6566320	I mean, the fact that I am going on this speech, to me,
6566320	6570320	feels like the perfect example of what is wrong with the current system.
6570320	6574320	You've got to try to stop taking over the spaceship.
6575320	6578320	I sound like the elf dad gnome.
6579320	6580320	Oh, yeah.
6580320	6582320	If I have to tell you.
6583320	6585320	These guys haven't seen elf.
6588320	6589320	Four of them have seen elf.
6589320	6590320	Great job, guys.
6590320	6591320	Quick question.
6591320	6594320	The comet has a laser.
6594320	6595320	Crap, 13%.
6595320	6596320	Is that what it hit us?
6596320	6598320	Should we be scared?
6598320	6601320	It seems like it's like lasers that are staying in places.
6601320	6604320	I mean, if I was a drift in space, I'd be scared, personally,
6604320	6606320	let alone with laser comets.
6606320	6610320	We've got to get this shit back on line so that we can be not a drift anymore.
6610320	6613320	Because that comet is not supposed to have laser energy in it.
6613320	6614320	And it shot us.
6614320	6615320	Yeah, that's right.
6615320	6618320	And, yep.
6618320	6620320	It appears to be changing course.
6620320	6621320	See?
6621320	6623320	It starts coming towards you.
6623320	6625320	Can we, can we, can we hail it?
6626320	6627320	Hail it?
6628320	6629320	You could, yeah.
6632320	6633320	You could hail it.
6634320	6637320	Captain Gaga, should we move course?
6639320	6642320	I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm going to the navigational controls.
6642320	6643320	The, what do you call them?
6643320	6645320	The piloting override.
6645320	6646320	The bridge?
6646320	6649320	Well, the, yeah, the thing that steers the ship.
6649320	6650320	The helm.
6651320	6652320	That's the helm.
6653320	6654320	And the gas puddle.
6656320	6662320	Yeah, so as it turns out, your quasar engine is, it's low in those quasar fluids.
6662320	6663320	Oh, I didn't know.
6663320	6666320	I mean, I did know that, but I didn't know the quasar engine.
6666320	6668320	I thought that was like what ran the windshield wipers.
6668320	6669320	No, they ran.
6669320	6671320	I mean, we could, we could hail the comet.
6672320	6676320	Yeah, I, I, maybe the lasers are made of repairmen.
6679320	6680320	You know, I, I, I.
6680320	6684320	Being an engineer, can I engineer something to help?
6684320	6685320	Well, what do you want to engineer?
6685320	6686320	Just fix it.
6687320	6688320	Fix what?
6688320	6689320	The quasar.
6689320	6690320	But is there a storage room?
6691320	6693320	Yeah, there's all sorts of storage rooms.
6693320	6694320	Do we have a storage room with quasar?
6695320	6696320	Can I go there?
6696320	6698320	You go into the storage room.
6698320	6706320	You see all sorts of blasters and energy weapons as well as force fields and canisters of quasar fluid.
6708320	6709320	Excellent.
6710320	6713320	I corner her in the storage closet.
6714320	6716320	I like comfortable.
6716320	6721320	I'm not physically like keeping her from leaving, but it's like, I make it awkward.
6723320	6728320	And I just start conversationally like, I'm like, you should wear more skirts to work.
6730320	6732320	Gaga, I don't want to step on your territory though.
6732320	6735320	I mean, you're Lady Gaga.
6735320	6738320	While they're in the closet, I hail the comet.
6739320	6743320	So, yeah, I think we're power up your power.
6743320	6744320	We need to get out of the closet.
6744320	6746320	Somebody hailing the comets.
6746320	6748320	The hailing frequencies are open.
6748320	6750320	You can you can say whatever you want.
6751320	6753320	Can you help me carry this out?
6753320	6757320	I mean, you know, he's he's hailing the comment he's saying to him.
6758320	6759320	I might be able to help.
6759320	6761320	Maybe I can speak a lot of different languages.
6761320	6762320	Yeah.
6762320	6763320	Well, yeah.
6763320	6764320	Well, yeah, that's a good.
6764320	6765320	Yes.
6765320	6766320	I'll try all those.
6766320	6768320	I'll try all the languages in my database.
6768320	6770320	Well, what do you want to say?
6771320	6773320	Please stop shooting us.
6773320	6777320	You tune into its frequency and you say that.
6778320	6782320	And you hear you hear a hissing buzz of the comets.
6783320	6787320	Frequency signals returning back to you in common language.
6788320	6790320	Can you translate that?
6791320	6792320	Yes.
6793320	6796320	It's saying, oh, OK.
6798320	6799320	All right.
6799320	6801320	It's saying, OK.
6801320	6802320	We did it.
6802320	6805320	The comment probably just got too high in Pittsburgh and wanted to.
6806320	6808320	I guess just lashing out a little bit.
6808320	6809320	All right.
6809320	6811320	Well, that was a I blow up the ship.
6813320	6819320	What what's in the is there something in the storage closet that if I kick, it'll blow up.
6819320	6821320	Well, there's all sorts of weaponry.
6821320	6822320	Yeah.
6822320	6825320	I take the biggest gun and I shoot the reddest container.
6828320	6830320	Every everything blows up.
6833320	6834320	All right.
6834320	6841320	Well, thank you for coming to our first live video streamed experiment at Harmontown.
6841320	6845320	Thank the rest of you for coming to our another normal Harmontown.
6845320	6846320	Yes.
6846320	6848320	Comptroller Alex Rubens.
6849320	6851320	Stacey from Washington.
6852320	6853320	Neil.
6854320	6855320	From.
6856320	6857320	From where?
6858320	6859320	Notting him.
6859320	6860320	Really?
6860320	6861320	Jesus.
6861320	6862320	Barry, the lead is from Nottingham.
6863320	6865320	Spencer from Pittsburgh.
6865320	6872320	Dustin Marshall, our producer, Kevin Day, our technical guru who came in and took over the place with his cameras.
6872320	6874320	We'll see how it works.
6875320	6876320	We'll give you more news.
6876320	6877320	Thanks for coming to Meltdown.
6877320	6878320	Thank you, Meltdown.
6878320	6879320	See you next week.
6879320	6880320	I think I think.
