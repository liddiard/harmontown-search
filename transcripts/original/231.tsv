0	26000	Stay on the beat.
26000	27000	Hello white people.
27000	39000	With almost no Spencer rhythm, from Hollywood, California, Harman Town is now in session.
39000	42000	Spencer Creighton.
42000	45000	Spencer.
45000	59000	And the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
59000	61000	Hello.
61000	63000	Hello.
63000	65000	Hello.
65000	66000	Thank you.
66000	69000	Thank you very much.
69000	73000	I was just watching Lady Gaga's halftime thing.
73000	74000	It's pretty awesome.
74000	81000	I risk nothing by saying I admire Lady Gaga.
81000	84000	No one's going to boo me for saying that.
84000	88000	I like to, well, one person wants to be special.
88000	91000	That's more just you cheering yourself.
91000	92000	Cheering narcissism.
92000	96000	I'm like, I'm not your average fan.
96000	99000	People on Twitter are always tweeting at me and going like,
99000	103000	I know you won't say anything unless I say something negative.
103000	105000	So fuck you.
105000	106000	Just kidding.
106000	110000	I love your work.
110000	115000	You're not wrong.
115000	118000	But I black people that do that because I'm just like, fuck you.
118000	119000	Then you're worse.
119000	120000	You're worse than bad people.
120000	127000	Like if you truly love me,
127000	129000	you should accept my laziness.
129000	131000	You should be my codependent lover.
131000	134000	You should just support me.
134000	137000	And my good mood should be your good mood.
137000	139000	You shouldn't need anything from me.
139000	142000	Or I am out the door.
142000	143000	And you know that about me.
143000	144000	You've learned that about me.
144000	146000	You've put up with four years of abuse.
146000	149000	You've lied to doctors for me.
149000	151000	Too soon?
151000	154000	Too soon.
154000	156000	60,000 years of misogyny.
156000	160000	Well, what was it, Dan, that struck you positively about the Lady Gaga?
160000	164000	Well, first of all, her fucking, not only her, well, just her wire work in general,
164000	170000	just as a decision is always, I admire anyone who chooses wire work.
170000	173000	From Garth Brooks to Beyonce to anybody.
173000	180000	If you say, bring out wires, I'm already on your side.
180000	183000	I'm not going to side with gravity.
183000	187000	I don't hope you fall and hurt yourself.
187000	189000	I admire you and I wouldn't be willing to do it.
189000	192000	But then, having chosen wires, she didn't just,
192000	195000	now, Jeff, as you know, I've been in the shit.
195000	196000	I was at Radio City Music Hall.
196000	198000	I wrote for the 2006 VMAs.
198000	202000	Beyonce, Queen Me, she came plummeted down on some fucking wires.
202000	203000	I watched her rehearse.
203000	207000	She's a pro.
207000	208000	Studingly gorgeous, amazing woman.
208000	209000	Great wire work.
209000	210000	She's great.
210000	215000	But Lady Gaga, so many years later, starts at the top of the stadium.
215000	217000	She jumped off the Eiffel Tower.
217000	221000	She jumped off like a regular person, but then it cut wide
221000	225000	and she was doing this Spiderman-like jiggle on the way down,
225000	227000	and I thought that was a cool thing to commit to.
227000	230000	Here's what I liked about Lady Gaga's performance.
230000	235000	She did everything that I would do if I was in wires.
235000	238000	I would also do that on the way down,
238000	241000	because I'd be like a little spider.
241000	246000	She didn't try to act like it's natural that she's like Helen Slater
246000	247000	and Supergirl.
247000	250000	I want to give some props to the people that created that rig,
250000	255000	because those harnesses, she was wearing a very small skimpy outfit.
255000	259000	She has a very tiny rig underneath that, and that's not comfortable.
259000	264000	For that to work, it's tighter than you want it to be
264000	267000	for that to be a safe mechanism.
267000	271000	She committed to lip-syncing a whole thing.
271000	274000	There's no way to sing when you have that thing on you,
274000	277000	because she's wearing a girdle made of girdles.
277000	283000	She took your lover, your life partner, your S.O. shirt
283000	285000	we were watching in the green room, and she said,
285000	287000	yeah, she really successfully took a Supergirl half-time
287000	289000	and made it just look like one of her videos,
289000	291000	which is a huge feat for the whole team.
291000	293000	I thought it looked wonderful.
294000	299000	I don't understand what was Neil Patrick Harris trying to tweet
299000	302000	when he said he was gagging over her half-time show,
302000	304000	because she's the best.
304000	307000	Did he mean to say gaga-ing?
307000	313000	Or is this new slang from the streets that I got to catch up to?
313000	316000	Man, I was gagging.
316000	318000	You're amazing. Your haircut's making me gag.
318000	320000	What? Fuck you.
321000	323000	Gotcha. It's the future.
323000	326000	Now, is N.T. here tonight?
326000	327000	No.
327000	332000	N.T. Kwaku, he tweeted because I actually really liked that.
332000	334000	He was down for that. He thought that was super cool.
334000	337000	But I think more importantly than Lady Gaga's performance,
337000	342000	I think it's time to have a good old-fashioned sports corner.
351000	354000	Well, Jeff, I got to tell you, I mean...
361000	363000	So, where do I start?
363000	366000	With the fact that the Falcons lost a 25-point lead
366000	368000	in the second half of the game?
368000	370000	Oh, shit!
370000	373000	Wait, did this is the first Super Bowl in history
373000	376000	that was one in overtime?
376000	379000	This guy did homework.
380000	383000	Yeah, because I was looking for Lady Gaga's video.
383000	385000	I got spoiled.
385000	388000	Aside from Tom Brady, name one other player.
388000	391000	Bill Billicheck.
391000	394000	Because I also saw Richard Spencer's tweet.
394000	396000	Richard Spencer was given... He's now on Twitter.
396000	398000	He's like a racist gourmand.
398000	400000	He was like, I'm going for the Patriots.
400000	402000	And he had a little checklist.
402000	405000	It was like, Tom Brady and Billicheck both support Trump.
405000	407000	More white receivers.
407000	410000	He had all the racial stats for the Patriots.
410000	415000	The only team with three white receivers.
415000	418000	He loves how white the football team is.
418000	422000	But it's like, typically people who are giving you sports statistics
422000	424000	are helping you bet and win.
424000	428000	But he's just like, you know, my money's on the master race.
428000	434000	Smart money is not on Arians for athletics
434000	438000	since the 1936 Olympics.
438000	440000	It's never been.
440000	442000	We settled that alone.
442000	444000	Steve Bannon looks like a...
444000	448000	Steve Bannon looks like the time I tried to shave my sack.
448000	450000	He also...
450000	452000	And absolutely failed.
452000	454000	As I tweeted today, he looks just like Bill Billicheck.
454000	456000	They both wore the same headset.
456000	458000	Beards are in Steve Bannon.
458000	461000	You don't even have to look the way you do to grow one.
461000	463000	Like, you should grow a beard.
463000	466000	That is uncomfortable, that face.
466000	471000	That is the face of someone who is proud of their race.
471000	474000	And he also has straight up, like, W.C. Fields' gin blossoms.
474000	476000	Like, he's clearly...
476000	480000	His eyes are like, oh, they're like welling with blood tears.
480000	486000	It's like the nerdy version of the Casino Royale bad guy.
486000	490000	Like, he just has a blood stigmatism in both eyes.
490000	493000	He's a terrible writer.
493000	495000	He's a terrible person.
495000	500000	And we got to get him out because he's going to fucking kill me.
500000	504000	I thought you were going to say, we got to get him on the show.
504000	506000	You saw the thing. I retweeted it.
506000	509000	And you guys hang on my every tweet.
509000	513000	And you re-hang on my every retweet.
513000	515000	There was...
515000	517000	He wrote a movie treatment.
517000	518000	He wanted to be...
518000	521000	You know, he's like a hack that got a piece of Seinfeld somehow.
521000	523000	He's got points in Seinfeld.
523000	526000	He used to be in Hollywood before all of this happened.
526000	527000	Yeah.
527000	529000	I think that's what gets my goat is Trump and Bannon.
529000	532000	They both kind of represent the things I hate most about myself.
532000	534000	Like, other people are like, Trump reminds me of my dad.
534000	537000	I'm like, my dad is way cooler than Donald Trump.
537000	539000	Like, it's me.
539000	541000	Who does this remind me of when Donald Trump tweets?
541000	543000	It's like, oh, it's me. It's me.
543000	547000	Like, all the things that make him a bad person.
547000	551000	But anyways, Steve Bannon reminds me of the bad writer part of me.
551000	558000	And there was some treatment that surfaced.
558000	564000	It's documentary style, of course, because hack Hackenstein.
564000	567000	There's like no narrative butt nuts at all.
567000	570000	No narrative butts about. No narrative butts, no cuts.
570000	575000	No narrative coconuts.
576000	577000	Episode title.
577000	578000	Episode title.
578000	579000	Push the structural button.
579000	580000	Pull the dialogue chain.
580000	581000	Outcome chocolate.
581000	583000	Pupu train.
583000	584000	Shoot your train.
584000	585000	All right.
585000	591000	Anyways, there's a treatment and he refers to Islamic fascism,
591000	594000	but he spells it facism.
594000	596000	What's the deal with this face?
596000	597000	Is that like a thing?
597000	599000	Is that like a British thing?
599000	603000	Because too many people are worried about facism.
603000	605000	Wait, are you telling me you can spell it that way?
605000	607000	I don't know. That's what I want to know.
607000	610000	Because it was so delicious that he just never looked up the word facism.
610000	611000	Too many people are doing it.
611000	612000	And I don't know.
612000	613000	I haven't bothered to look it up.
613000	617000	Has anyone seen it spelled facism in the audience?
617000	620000	I mean, is that like they spell favorite with a U?
620000	622000	That's what I'm wondering.
622000	623000	I don't think so.
623000	627000	I believe that many people are stupid, but it's just striking.
627000	628000	I don't understand.
628000	629000	Well, I don't know.
629000	634000	My favorite new thing is all the armchair electronic forensics that go on
634000	638000	like when Trump, when the sheet left off,
638000	641000	it said there was like the phone log of all the leaders Trump talked to.
641000	644000	And then it was like, president of Mexico.
644000	645000	Talk to him.
645000	646000	President of whatever.
646000	647000	President, president of whatever.
647000	652000	And then it was like, it just said talk to Australia or something like that.
652000	654000	And it didn't have the guy's name.
654000	657000	And it was, or did it say president of Australia and then left it blank?
657000	659000	At some point they had president there.
659000	660000	Yeah.
660000	661000	But they, uh, yeah.
661000	665000	And somebody said like, Oh, if you Google president and Australia,
665000	668000	there's no Wikipedia or Google or Google hit that comes up.
668000	669000	So they just left it blank.
669000	670000	I'm like, Oh my God.
670000	671000	I love them.
671000	675000	I love the backtracking and realizing like what like that with unprecedented
675000	676000	too.
676000	677000	I did the same thing.
677000	682000	I typed in unprecedented and, um, something came up that I can't remember.
682000	687000	I remember you can realize like you can walk in the shoes of, of, of stupid
687000	691000	people and go like, Oh my God, that's what happened.
691000	694000	And, and, and they're running everything and it's amazing.
694000	698000	Um, but, but it's, you know, yeah, yeah, you know, we're nor it's,
698000	699000	it's getting normal.
699000	700000	We're normalizing, right?
700000	702000	That's what we're supposed to do.
702000	705000	No, it's getting totally normal.
705000	710000	Is there a William Ralph or Ralph William here in the crowd?
710000	715000	Is there, uh, were your grandparents born here?
715000	720000	Cause we've got a new segment for our show.
720000	726000	Uh, what, what, what, why did you want Ralph Lauren to, is it William C.
726000	727000	Ralph or Ralph C.
727000	728000	William?
728000	733000	Uh, uh, did you drop a credit card by any chance?
733000	737000	I'm thinking you must, it's almost a guarantee now.
737000	742000	Would you happen to know, uh, the last two digits of it?
742000	745000	Nope.
745000	748000	Ralph Lauren's worst nemesis.
748000	749000	Like he's always trying to.
749000	752000	Ralph or William, I have your card up here.
752000	753000	You dropped it.
753000	756000	So if you want to come up and show me some ID, I'll give it back to you.
756000	757000	Nice.
757000	758000	Or I keep it.
758000	764000	And, or I just announce you have 10 seconds before I read the entire four,
764000	770000	eight, 11, that's not even.
770000	771000	All right.
771000	772000	Ralph is at the podium.
772000	774000	He's showing the ID.
774000	779000	I like that we have like two, two factor authentication here.
779000	782000	We had a guy lie to get on stage in San Francisco.
782000	784000	I don't trust these fuckers anymore.
784000	785000	What was the guy's name?
785000	786000	Sane?
786000	787000	That guy was amazing.
787000	796000	When he came up on stage, I missed the fact that he said that to Dan and to
796000	800000	the audience that he had lied about being a Trump supporter to get on stage.
800000	801000	I'm so happy.
801000	805000	I didn't hear him say that because I would have summarily thrown him out of
805000	806000	the building.
806000	813000	His suicide thing notwithstanding, I still would have made a point of telling
813000	816000	him to fuck straight off into the night.
816000	821000	You can't just lie to get up on stage.
821000	823000	We would prefer you did not do that.
823000	830000	I feel bad to make this guy show me ID to give him his credit card back because I
830000	832000	don't know what world we live in anymore.
832000	839000	That might have been Adam Goldberg wearing high heels to get up here and take
839000	840000	this guy's credit card.
840000	842000	That's not why I wear high heels.
843000	845000	Oh, Adam, you're here?
845000	846000	Oh, you son of a bitch.
846000	848000	Adam Goldberg, everybody.
848000	853000	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
860000	861000	Well, is that...
861000	862000	Is that the magic word?
862000	863000	That didn't...
863000	864000	No one to blame but yourself.
864000	866000	I just...
866000	867000	I just...
867000	869000	I just Beetlejuice you up on stage.
869000	870000	Yeah.
870000	873000	He's three times more deadly than Beetlejuice.
873000	875000	Jesus Christ.
875000	879000	Why is that so terrifying that you're here of all times?
879000	881000	I was the Patriots one.
881000	882000	And now you fucking...
882000	884000	You knew England asshole.
884000	887000	They eat the overdogs one and it feels so good.
887000	890000	I've been a fair weather fan for 15 years.
890000	892000	I've watched a lot of Super Bowls.
892000	894000	I'm going to hit your music cue so quick you're going to hit your head.
894000	896000	You're going to spin.
896000	898000	He hits a music cue?
898000	903000	I'm going to play a musical sting to get him off the stage at any moment.
903000	905000	I accept that damn agreement.
905000	906000	Let's reconnect, Adam.
906000	908000	What's been going on with you since we last met?
908000	909000	I started a company.
909000	911000	It's doing really well.
911000	914000	And I'm trying to start a political action committee with Spencer.
914000	916000	That's not as far as we thought.
916000	920000	He started DMing me about a political action committee.
920000	922000	You responded.
922000	925000	Oh, wait, no.
925000	927000	This is about as far as we got.
927000	929000	I think this is more than we've talked about.
929000	932000	I think what he's saying is essentially technically accurate.
932000	937000	You guys are in direct contact with each other and it is an ongoing channel of communication.
937000	938000	We did talk about a thing.
938000	941000	We've elevated it now.
941000	943000	What's your philosophy about political action?
943000	944000	I mean, a lot of people...
944000	946000	Any port in a storm...
946000	948000	If you've got ideas, I want to hear them.
948000	952000	I love that America's premier Nazi is saying,
952000	957000	Oh, it's white people who did it while the four catches were done by a Jewish guy in the end zone.
957000	959000	Like, are Jews white?
959000	961000	Did you just ignore my question?
961000	963000	That's my political...
963000	965000	You're just like, anyway, fuck off.
965000	968000	So here's my first bit.
968000	970000	You didn't even hear me.
970000	972000	I'm one of the hardcore people.
972000	975000	I went to a symposium on the letter from a Birmingham jail,
975000	977000	so I do have a nuanced opinion on this.
977000	979000	But I do believe you should...
980000	984000	What I've always respected about you, Adam, is your nuance.
986000	989000	We all agree you can punch Nazis.
989000	992000	There's not going to be about whether that's helpful or not.
992000	995000	When they go low, you stomp on their Nazi skulls.
995000	998000	But that's not your committee's platform.
998000	1000000	That's not what we're raising money for.
1000000	1001000	Can I punch up your slogan?
1001000	1005000	When they go low, we go, Hi-yah!
1005000	1007000	Mr. Jeff.
1007000	1009000	That bought me another 40 seconds answer.
1009000	1011000	He wants...
1011000	1013000	Jeff, he wants you in on this, by the way.
1013000	1014000	Yeah.
1014000	1017000	Count me...
1017000	1018000	In.
1018000	1021000	You're the political party animal.
1021000	1023000	Oh, yeah.
1023000	1024000	Yeah, man.
1024000	1027000	What would my task be?
1027000	1028000	Shmoozin.
1028000	1031000	Shmoozin and boozin. Shmoozin.
1031000	1033000	I'm halfway there.
1033000	1035000	Jeff and I are officially patriots now.
1035000	1036000	We're men of political action.
1036000	1037000	We're going to use our weak privilege.
1037000	1039000	I'm a falcon. I'm a falcon.
1039000	1040000	Nice.
1040000	1042000	Well, then I'm wearing...
1042000	1044000	I outrank you. I'm a patriot.
1044000	1045000	Boo...
1045000	1046000	I thought I'd get boozed for that.
1046000	1047000	That can never predict...
1047000	1048000	Oh, patriots like the football team.
1048000	1049000	Yeah, patriots, falcons like the football team.
1049000	1051000	Essentially the same joke Jeff was doing.
1051000	1052000	Oh, you're right.
1052000	1054000	All right.
1054000	1056000	What is your...
1056000	1058000	What is your action committee...
1058000	1059000	Wait, no, I can't stomp that.
1059000	1061000	Robert Kraft gave me that hat.
1061000	1062000	Oh.
1062000	1063000	We have to...
1063000	1069000	The names you drop hit the floor like a...
1069000	1072000	Like a tarantula that's eaten too much rice.
1072000	1076000	Like a tarantula that's notoriously explode if they fall from higher than three feet.
1076000	1080000	They hit the ground like a Tom Brady pass in the first half of the year.
1080000	1082000	You're right.
1082000	1083000	The...
1083000	1085000	It's important...
1085000	1087000	We're coming into an age now, it's like,
1087000	1090000	all right, there's this groundswell of political action which is fantastic,
1090000	1093000	but with that comes like anxiety about like,
1093000	1098000	okay, so now how do you tell the brave souls that are right-minded
1098000	1100000	that are going to make good coordinators
1100000	1104000	and whose cause is worth congealing around from the people that are just like,
1104000	1108000	get your hot dogs, get your political action here,
1108000	1113000	got a t-shirt with a phrase on it and all the money goes to our meetings
1113000	1115000	and we're going to hang out and talk about action.
1115000	1116000	Yeah.
1116000	1120000	I want to tell everyone here that there is a lot to do in your local community.
1120000	1123000	We see LA as like this liberal bastion,
1123000	1127000	but we still in California incarcerate more people than any other state.
1127000	1131000	We still have people being fined and arrested for being late to public school
1131000	1133000	and we still have a lot of work that we can do here.
1133000	1137000	So yours is a local, you want to focus on the local...
1137000	1142000	There's a swing district up in Palmdale that we can turn to a Democratic seat, but...
1142000	1146000	Okay, this is singing a tune that early on in the early apocalypse
1146000	1148000	kind of like foreshadowing kind of days.
1148000	1153000	This was the guiding light, although the really hard to digest one
1153000	1157000	because it just takes so much work, but it's like the idea of like political parties
1157000	1161000	going back to being political parties, making Democrats be like,
1161000	1166000	in your local neighborhood, the reason why the church gets repainted,
1166000	1169000	the reason why you have a blanket, the reason why whatever,
1169000	1174000	whatever shit goes down, like have a, even if it's a sub faction of Democrats
1174000	1176000	before we would talk about third party stuff,
1176000	1179000	which just feels like a fucking self-defeating thing.
1179000	1181000	It is a conversation, not as a solution.
1181000	1184000	There are two parties and we have to work to...
1184000	1187000	We now know that those parties mean nothing.
1187000	1190000	I mean, we know that those parties, because one was hacked
1190000	1193000	and one almost splintered and got beaten by the hacked one.
1193000	1196000	So that's actually quote unquote good news is that the bipartisan system
1196000	1199000	actually got functionally like jailbroken.
1199000	1202000	And I think that can be a really good thing because it means
1202000	1206000	the Democratic Party could actually be simply as the Republican one was...
1206000	1208000	It's ready for rebranding.
1208000	1212000	And I think instead, whereas it's a primitive thing to think about,
1212000	1217000	oh, where's my big strong hero leader that's going to like represent all these things
1217000	1220000	like if the Democrats now could rise up as the board cube that they are
1220000	1224000	and take over the Democratic Party as a board cube and say,
1224000	1227000	no, we're the fucking Democrats. We represent the majority.
1227000	1230000	You can't beat us. We're a fucking credit union politically.
1230000	1235000	Like we got experts on the ecology, we got experts on equality, blah, blah, blah.
1235000	1238000	Yeah, we have to technically have a presidential candidate,
1238000	1243000	but they're nothing. They're a civil servant.
1243000	1248000	We tested them like an astronaut to see if they could legalize abortion
1248000	1251000	in zero gravity.
1251000	1253000	It makes aftercare easier for the procedure.
1253000	1256000	But anyways, anyways, I'm jumping...
1256000	1259000	But that sounds like a good start.
1259000	1261000	I'm glad you're thinking about local stuff.
1261000	1266000	That seems like a good idea that if that could shoot spores out to other districts
1266000	1270000	that are maybe technically red because of 10 people or 20...
1270000	1274000	And then take those over with action, that's just like,
1274000	1277000	well, I'll be darned. These people care.
1277000	1281000	They're not just playing a game of chess against a red team.
1281000	1286000	I would make the point that the ideas that made the Democratic Party so formidable
1286000	1292000	between, I'd say, 1920 and 1960 were ideas that America is still interested in.
1292000	1296000	The idea of fair wages for fair work, the idea of environmental protection,
1296000	1299000	the idea of strong banking laws to protect the little people.
1299000	1302000	But this goes back to an idea you've always had,
1302000	1306000	and when I explain it to Lyft drivers, because those poor people...
1306000	1309000	That's step four of the plan.
1310000	1313000	Talk to your Lyft driver. It works.
1313000	1315000	They are all woke.
1315000	1318000	But it goes back to your idea that power corrupts not when you have it,
1318000	1320000	but because you want it.
1320000	1323000	And in the 70s, a lot of people came in after Watergate and said,
1323000	1325000	all government is corrupt.
1325000	1328000	We need to get rid of everyone who's been here more than 10 years.
1328000	1331000	A lot of those people got kicked out were people who fought big banks
1331000	1334000	during the Great Depression.
1334000	1337000	So you can overclean house, you can get rid of allies,
1337000	1340000	because they don't agree with you on all issues.
1340000	1343000	There are some things we shouldn't collaborate on.
1343000	1345000	There are some things we should stand firm on.
1345000	1349000	But there's a great number of people who want to hear our message.
1349000	1352000	There are a great number of people who haven't heard the message
1352000	1354000	but were being amenable.
1354000	1357000	And there's a great amount of people who didn't vote because they didn't care
1357000	1359000	but didn't vote because they couldn't leave work
1359000	1361000	or whose votes weren't counted
1361000	1364000	or weren't able to see themselves in the process
1364000	1367000	of what's happened to non-mother neoliberalism.
1367000	1368000	These people...
1368000	1371000	This is the first time you've ever gotten applause.
1371000	1373000	Four years of our show.
1373000	1376000	I did once in Adam versus Spencer, I think.
1376000	1381000	Spencer, what is your relationship with Adam in this whole thing?
1381000	1383000	When did you guys become one of your dams?
1383000	1387000	As we said, he DM-ed me about this idea.
1387000	1389000	And now he's here.
1389000	1393000	I would have typed it out more, but I've been having carpal tunnel questions.
1393000	1396000	If I didn't accidentally... I didn't know that you were here tonight.
1396000	1398000	If I didn't accidentally conjure your name up,
1398000	1401000	you would have still made your way on stage tonight, wouldn't you?
1401000	1403000	She would have found a way.
1403000	1404000	The dark magics are powerful.
1404000	1407000	This is adult Adam.
1407000	1411000	We've got to remember, our podcast has been going on for like five years.
1411000	1414000	Adam's like 28 now.
1414000	1416000	He's growing.
1416000	1419000	I've had the grace of this, but a lot of it was me being a lowly,
1419000	1421000	underemployed Hollywood person.
1421000	1423000	If I could get a writer's job on community,
1423000	1426000	all my problems would be solved, and I would be likable.
1426000	1428000	And it wasn't the case.
1428000	1430000	Yeah.
1430000	1433000	Wait, that was your angle in the beginning, to be a writer on community?
1433000	1439000	You can get the top writing job at community and go forever unlikable.
1439000	1441000	There's no likability.
1441000	1442000	Why don't you just highlight that job?
1442000	1446000	Hire him right now as head writer on community.
1446000	1449000	Finally, I can say yes, I am Adam F. Goldberg.
1449000	1450000	I did produce it.
1450000	1454000	All right, Adam, for those of us that did smatter that applause,
1454000	1459000	and you're thinking locally, and what could be more foolproof?
1459000	1464000	Because even if it turns out to not be the way to turn the whole world
1464000	1468000	the other direction, you still, as a loser,
1468000	1472000	will have helped the world that's real around you.
1472000	1476000	So I am adding my smatter to that smatter applause.
1476000	1477000	I appreciate that.
1477000	1480000	So how do people that agree that, you know,
1480000	1484000	okay, I could use some direction and something to do on Sunday or whatever,
1484000	1485000	how do we find your...
1485000	1489000	Well, if you're hardcore into wanting to organize other people,
1489000	1492000	the SDS is always trying to find new members,
1492000	1495000	because Democratic Socialists today.
1495000	1496000	Okay.
1496000	1498000	Yeah.
1498000	1499000	We have a member of the...
1499000	1500000	That's our cheer.
1500000	1502000	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
1502000	1505000	We have a member of the Sioux Nation back there.
1505000	1507000	And remember what color fat Albert's sweater was?
1507000	1508000	Right.
1508000	1510000	What were you yelling about, sir, or ma'am?
1510000	1511000	The part...
1511000	1512000	Democratic socialism.
1512000	1513000	Oh, okay.
1513000	1514000	Okay.
1514000	1515000	You're just yelling about Democratic socialism.
1515000	1516000	Okay.
1516000	1517000	That really...
1517000	1518000	He was right.
1518000	1519000	That's your cry.
1519000	1520000	Okay.
1520000	1521000	That's your hooah.
1521000	1522000	Hey, hey, hey.
1522000	1523000	All right.
1523000	1524000	So...
1524000	1525000	But your organization, you're not...
1525000	1526000	You have nothing to plug yet.
1526000	1527000	No, no.
1527000	1528000	Okay, fine.
1528000	1530000	So we sign up to be socialists.
1530000	1531000	Just willy-nilly.
1531000	1533000	I mean, if you Google Democratic Party
1533000	1535000	or whatever party you're in in your local area,
1535000	1536000	you will find groups.
1536000	1537000	There are Facebook groups.
1537000	1538000	There are meet-up groups.
1538000	1540000	There's everything from picking up trash
1540000	1542000	from the side of the highway to, you know,
1542000	1544000	phone banking your senators.
1544000	1547000	There's the, I think, 11 actions.
1547000	1549000	There's a movement to...
1549000	1550000	Like a video game.
1550000	1551000	Have something that you can do every week
1551000	1554000	to help bring about the country that you want to see.
1554000	1555000	Okay.
1555000	1557000	Yeah, you can follow Adam Ultraberg on Twitter.
1557000	1559000	Eventually, I will stop posting about the Patriots.
1559000	1560000	I promise.
1560000	1561000	All right.
1561000	1563000	And the jokes will be just as good as these.
1563000	1564000	All right.
1564000	1565000	Well, let's quit.
1565000	1567000	Well, you're ahead, Adam Goldberg, everybody.
1567000	1568000	Yes!
1569000	1570000	Adam Goldberg.
1574000	1576000	It's a whole new world, Jeff.
1576000	1577000	All right.
1577000	1579000	We're through the looking glass, man.
1579000	1580000	Yeah, I just...
1580000	1582000	Adam Goldberg did a victory dance off the stage.
1582000	1583000	It was good.
1583000	1586000	The president's at war with Arnold Schwarzenegger's ratings
1586000	1588000	even though it's a show he runs.
1589000	1592000	Pay attention to that, by the way.
1592000	1595000	Bad businessman just makes bad business decisions.
1595000	1597000	I mean, say what you want,
1597000	1600000	but you got to say that he's a man of faith.
1600000	1601000	Yeah, no.
1601000	1603000	He's a true Christian hero.
1603000	1604000	He was praying for those ratings.
1604000	1606000	You know, yeah.
1606000	1607000	But also, yeah.
1607000	1610000	I mean, congratulations if you're a 4channer
1610000	1612000	that wanted to hack the government
1612000	1613000	and get this guy elected.
1613000	1616000	Like he's a flavor of Mountain Dew
1616000	1618000	that you could make Hitler.
1619000	1623000	Very funny bit, but now the guy that's going to bring about
1623000	1626000	the end of net neutrality has been put in the...
1626000	1627000	You know, whatever.
1627000	1631000	He's got his chairman in charge of vice assistant cybernetting
1631000	1635000	or, you know, is some guy that just fucking hates net neutrality.
1635000	1636000	What is net neutrality?
1636000	1638000	I don't know.
1638000	1641000	I know it's better than non-net neutrality.
1641000	1644000	I know that the end of net neutrality has something to do with a world
1644000	1646000	where you and I can have political opinions
1646000	1651000	and no matter how popular they would get in an open idea marketplace,
1651000	1655000	they might be fucking absolutely inaccessible
1655000	1661000	by virtue of the Walgreens or Netflix next door to you cybernetically
1661000	1663000	that just needs more fucking data.
1663000	1669000	Like poor people will no longer be able to spread as much information
1669000	1673000	as corporations, and that is a really, really slippery slope.
1673000	1675000	Neutrality.
1675000	1677000	Donald Trump clearly, obviously not a fan of it.
1677000	1679000	He's not, if you asked him, he'd be like,
1679000	1682000	what does that mean? Does it make my scalp smaller?
1683000	1689000	Is it something I can grab, rape, beat, make fun of?
1689000	1691000	Is my dad afraid of it?
1691000	1693000	Will the ghost of my father mock me
1693000	1697000	while he punches the ghost of my wife at the foot of my bed?
1697000	1701000	Because if it doesn't fit into those slots
1701000	1705000	in my gradually micro-stroking 75-year-old brain,
1705000	1707000	I don't know what you're talking about,
1707000	1710000	so he puts some guy that knows a lot about computers
1710000	1712000	in charge of all computers in the world,
1712000	1715000	and so good job, 4chan.
1715000	1719000	Which I think is on the internet,
1719000	1722000	the place where you got together and elected this guy.
1722000	1725000	I'm worried that if he stays in the office long enough,
1725000	1730000	the world's Thai fabric resources will be depleted
1730000	1733000	probably in like six months.
1733000	1737000	His Thai really goes down to the tip of his mangled dick.
1737000	1741000	His assuredly mangled dick.
1741000	1743000	Absolutely.
1743000	1747000	His wife won't live with him in the White House.
1747000	1750000	Like it's the best house!
1750000	1753000	Like how fucking repellent and repugnant
1753000	1756000	and bad in bed and disappointing of a fucking human male
1756000	1758000	do you have to be?
1758000	1761000	For your wife to go, eh.
1761000	1765000	I don't want to live in the world's most famous house.
1765000	1767000	I'd rather live in our shitty apartment building
1767000	1770000	surrounded by a fucking police state.
1770000	1773000	He's so fucked up, we have to pay for his wife
1773000	1776000	not wanting to fuck him.
1776000	1779000	Ah, Jeff.
1779000	1781000	I didn't read about any of that.
1782000	1785000	Apparently the taxpayer,
1785000	1787000	because she wants to live at the Trump Tower,
1787000	1789000	she's going to live in a golden building
1789000	1793000	and it costs the taxpayers $400,000 a day
1793000	1796000	for her police detail to make her live at home,
1796000	1799000	not at home at the White House.
1799000	1802000	She doesn't want to be around this fucking piece of garbage.
1802000	1805000	You saw them dancing and it was a bummer.
1805000	1807000	When he started singing My Way?
1807000	1809000	He clearly was saying things wrong.
1809000	1813000	She was like, please, please, just stop it.
1813000	1817000	She's just saying to herself,
1817000	1820000	just get through whatever contractual period
1820000	1822000	I'm confined to.
1822000	1824000	As Church said, my gal,
1824000	1826000	he didn't expect to win.
1826000	1828000	She thought they were going to lose and she would divorce him.
1828000	1830000	Now she's stuck with this piece of shit.
1830000	1832000	This is his third wife, right?
1832000	1834000	Third? At least.
1834000	1836000	That we know about.
1836000	1840000	The first one was an American model, right?
1840000	1842000	Marla Maples.
1842000	1845000	Wasn't there a second middle one that was...
1845000	1848000	I don't want to use this term disparagingly
1848000	1850000	to somebody that I really don't know,
1850000	1852000	or if this is an offensive term.
1852000	1854000	She was essentially a mail-order bride, right?
1854000	1858000	She was also a Russian model or what was...
1858000	1861000	He was Ivanka's mom.
1861000	1863000	Ivanka Trump first, then Marla?
1863000	1865000	Then Marla.
1866000	1868000	I get confused.
1868000	1870000	This is his third wife, right?
1870000	1872000	This is his third wife.
1872000	1874000	It's his second non-American wife.
1874000	1876000	I'm not going where you think I'm going.
1876000	1878000	I'm not like Alex Jones going.
1878000	1880000	Wait a minute.
1880000	1882000	I'm just talking sexually.
1882000	1884000	I'm talking about psychosexual politics.
1884000	1886000	I'm talking about...
1886000	1889000	First, you have a woman from your own country
1889000	1894000	that was born within the same
1894000	1896000	sort of glass ceilings aside,
1896000	1898000	the same sort of sandbox you were in
1898000	1900000	with the same rules and things.
1900000	1902000	Then she's gone. She's out of there.
1902000	1905000	Then, like Howard Hughes in The Aviator,
1905000	1908000	it's like Katherine Hepburn takes a hike,
1908000	1910000	and then you cut to the airplane hanger scene
1910000	1913000	where Howard Hughes is bringing underage girls in
1913000	1914000	and going like,
1914000	1916000	stop right there 300 meters away.
1916000	1918000	You understand you'll be an employee contracted to me
1918000	1920000	and you'll do what I say.
1920000	1921000	Turn around.
1921000	1923000	Wipe that lipstick off and stuff.
1923000	1924000	You're a teen in The Aviator.
1924000	1926000	Come on. It's your favorite movie, right?
1926000	1928000	You've watched it 75 times
1928000	1930000	because you have some perverse fantasy
1930000	1931000	of being America's most famous
1931000	1933000	mentally ill entrepreneur
1933000	1935000	because it reminds you of yourself.
1935000	1940000	And so I thought, like, what?
1940000	1943000	That's how we found Spencer.
1943000	1945000	So you have that scene,
1945000	1947000	and maybe ladies cover your ears.
1947000	1949000	I don't know what's going to offend you here.
1949000	1950000	I would say don't.
1950000	1952000	I would say hit record.
1952000	1954000	When I say cover your ears,
1954000	1956000	I just mean, like, don't judge.
1956000	1958000	Like, for a second, if you will,
1958000	1960000	if I'd be candid for a second.
1960000	1963000	Guys do, like, we go through ups and downs,
1963000	1966000	and we do, like, when we get our hearts broken,
1966000	1969000	I think there is a tendency to,
1969000	1971000	like, we have these things we do,
1971000	1972000	especially when we're young
1972000	1974000	and we're still learning how to interact with people,
1974000	1976000	but we go, like, we swing the other way,
1976000	1979000	you know, like, from whatever previous relationship.
1979000	1981000	Like, we think we're going to fix things,
1981000	1983000	and I'm sure this is not totally exclusive to men,
1983000	1984000	but I'm just talking to the guys,
1984000	1987000	because guys are kind of inherently, you know,
1987000	1989000	we're misogynistic, we're inherent,
1989000	1993000	we love, slash, fear, slash, worship, slash, hate,
1993000	1997000	despise this other creature that has so much power over us
1997000	1998000	that we don't understand,
1998000	2000000	we just want them to like us, blah, blah, blah.
2000000	2002000	Makes us behave in all these fucked up ways.
2002000	2004000	We've been socialized not to share those feelings,
2004000	2007000	cope with them, connect those to the feelings
2007000	2009000	that are also fucked up with the other person
2009000	2010000	and achieve that.
2010000	2012000	You don't start learning that stuff until you're 44 and rich
2012000	2016000	and already divorced and are like finally opening the hood
2016000	2019000	a little more than two inches on the fucked up car
2019000	2020000	that is your life.
2020000	2024000	So you're keeping this very general for all men.
2024000	2025000	Yeah.
2025000	2027000	This is stuff you need time and money
2027000	2029000	and the inclination to examine,
2029000	2032000	and I don't blame your average 40-year-old guy
2032000	2035000	that has a lot more work to do for not getting there.
2035000	2036000	This is a tangent.
2036000	2039000	I'm just saying, here's what I'm saying in the Crassus terms.
2039000	2044000	I'm like, if your first wife was an American model
2044000	2046000	and then your second wife was a Russian model
2046000	2049000	and then your third wife was a Russian model,
2049000	2053000	here's what I'm assuming about the third marriage.
2053000	2058000	There's preconditions up the fucking darkest yin-yang imaginable
2058000	2060000	because there's no other difference.
2060000	2063000	He didn't go to French model.
2063000	2065000	He didn't go to Japanese model.
2065000	2070000	He was like, I like me those Eastern Bloc women,
2070000	2072000	and here's another one.
2072000	2075000	I'm guaranteeing you there's some fucked up differences
2075000	2078000	at the outset of that relationship that result in that face
2078000	2080000	that she's making that broke your heart
2080000	2083000	because you said it reminded you of what you do at the Apple store.
2083000	2085000	Right.
2085000	2089000	Spencer said that's the face of a customer service rep.
2089000	2090000	Right.
2090000	2093000	So you know, you're smiling and they turn around
2093000	2095000	and you're like, whoa.
2095000	2098000	Then you're just back to hating everything.
2098000	2099000	She's a hostage.
2099000	2100000	It's the worst.
2100000	2101000	Yeah.
2101000	2102000	Anyways.
2102000	2103000	It's sad.
2103000	2104000	I mean, benefit of the doubt,
2104000	2106000	I'm hoping that she doesn't want to live with Donald Trump
2106000	2109000	because he's a gross perverted asshole
2109000	2111000	and she wants to take care of Barron.
2111000	2113000	Like, you know, like maybe he needs special care or whatever
2113000	2114000	and she doesn't want anything to do.
2114000	2115000	And kids are not women.
2115000	2116000	Huh?
2116000	2117000	No.
2117000	2119000	Like, I mean, maybe she's an awesome mom
2119000	2122000	who doesn't want to be involved in that circus.
2122000	2124000	Like, I'm hoping that that's the case.
2124000	2127000	But one thing's for certain, she doesn't want to be around him.
2127000	2130000	And now we have to foot the goddamn bill.
2130000	2132000	And we have to be around him.
2132000	2133000	I know.
2133000	2136000	It's like we're the most victimized neighbor
2136000	2138000	in the world to that fucked up relationship.
2138000	2149000	Like, the caretaker at the Overlook Hotel had it better.
2149000	2155000	Batman Brothers, Dan, he had a name.
2155000	2156000	Okay.
2156000	2157000	So here's the thing.
2157000	2161000	So capitalist, what do you call it?
2161000	2162000	What do you call it?
2162000	2163000	Activism.
2163000	2164000	Consumer activism.
2164000	2165000	All right.
2165000	2170000	So Uber, we fucking, the people spoke with their money.
2170000	2171000	And then he quit.
2171000	2174000	And then he pulled out of the thing that was egregiously like,
2174000	2175000	oh, I love Trump.
2175000	2178000	And I think maybe issued a statement
2178000	2180000	that kind of disavowed the whole thing.
2180000	2182000	He said, I didn't want this to be about politics.
2182000	2184000	I just wanted it to be about being part of the thing.
2184000	2186000	And it hurt his bottom line.
2186000	2187000	And he fucked straight up.
2187000	2190000	So the question is, I'm going to disagree with Cody about this.
2190000	2193000	Because she's like, oh, you can reinstall Uber now.
2193000	2195000	And I was like, wait, fuck him.
2195000	2196000	No.
2196000	2197000	Off with his head.
2197000	2198000	Like, he'll be fine anyway.
2198000	2202000	Like, let him just drive all Republicans around.
2202000	2206000	But I'll see you at the finish line.
2206000	2207000	He was already a prick before.
2207000	2209000	But she's got a point too, though.
2209000	2212000	If we actually want to, if it's about, you know,
2212000	2213000	it's just about swatting.
2213000	2214000	And I don't know.
2214000	2215000	It's like a very interesting argument.
2215000	2217000	She's like, oh, you can take an Uber now
2217000	2221000	because he got hit and acknowledged
2221000	2224000	he got hit publicly and cow-towed
2224000	2226000	to the will of the people.
2226000	2228000	What you don't want to do is continue
2228000	2231000	to just grind his face into the dirt.
2231000	2233000	I mean, I don't want to say things and be
2233000	2234000	fake news about this.
2234000	2237000	But it hasn't already been a lot of mistreatment
2237000	2238000	of his workers.
2238000	2241000	I would say that he should have stopped using Uber well
2241000	2242000	before this.
2242000	2245000	Because there's loads of sexual assault charges.
2245000	2247000	Right.
2247000	2249000	His workers are really ill-treated.
2249000	2250000	You guys really high-roaded me.
2250000	2251000	Well, no.
2251000	2253000	I mean, I'm a big Lyft guy, though.
2253000	2254000	I agree with that.
2254000	2256000	I just like being able to tip because I'm just like,
2256000	2259000	now I can give him however many stars I want.
2259000	2260000	Yeah.
2260000	2261000	Because I'm paying for it.
2261000	2263000	Here's the weird thing about Lyft, though,
2263000	2264000	that I've switched.
2264000	2265000	And I'm not going to go back.
2265000	2267000	I've learned to cope with Lyft.
2267000	2271000	And it's not as bad as it was when I stopped using it.
2271000	2275000	But the form, I'm never going to give you less than five stars
2275000	2279000	unless you run over my dog or something.
2279000	2281000	But if you give less than five stars,
2281000	2283000	if you press less than five stars before you submit,
2283000	2287000	it says, how can Rashida improve?
2287000	2289000	But if you give five stars, as tonight, Rashida
2289000	2291000	drove me here in a Lyft.
2291000	2293000	And then you give five stars.
2293000	2297000	Then it says, what did you love about Rashida?
2297000	2300000	I've never had that feedback thing.
2300000	2301000	It's right there.
2301000	2302000	I mean, do you not?
2302000	2305000	No, I've only given less than five stars maybe two or three times ever.
2305000	2306000	And I take Lyft all the time.
2306000	2307000	You know what I'm saying?
2307000	2309000	When you give five stars, the question changes
2309000	2311000	from what would you improve to what did you love?
2311000	2315000	I'm saying I've never gotten that feedback loop thing.
2315000	2317000	They've never asked me, tell me why you gave five stars
2317000	2318000	or tell me why you didn't.
2318000	2319000	I've never seen that.
2319000	2320000	They probably don't care about it.
2320000	2322000	Update your app, motherfucker.
2322000	2325000	It sounds like I don't.
2325000	2329000	They added the social anxiety feature.
2329000	2330000	My point is, what do you type?
2330000	2332000	Does anybody ever type anything?
2332000	2339000	I was flirting with ironic things, like the stars in his eyes.
2339000	2341000	I don't want to confuse people.
2341000	2343000	I've never been asked to weigh in on why.
2343000	2345000	I've only said you get to rate them,
2345000	2347000	and that's the end of the transaction.
2347000	2350000	Well, to tell you the truth, I thought that was going to be
2350000	2352000	a half hour of the show, was talking about that,
2352000	2355000	but now we're fucked.
2355000	2356000	It appears that's a dead end.
2356000	2358000	Is there a Thomas C. Howell here?
2358000	2360000	I have your credit card.
2360000	2361000	Thomas C. Howell?
2361000	2363000	Is this the actor?
2363000	2366000	I have a load of credit cards up here that people have dropped.
2366000	2370000	I think he's been killed by Rucker Howard.
2370000	2371000	God damn it, Harmon.
2371000	2373000	Fucking get your shit together.
2373000	2376000	See, I can never keep track of whether you are
2376000	2378000	with the Apple Watch or against the Apple Watch.
2378000	2380000	Well, I'm trying it again tonight.
2380000	2381000	Because sometimes you have it.
2381000	2382000	Because I had so few notes, I thought,
2382000	2384000	well, I'll just put them on my watch instead of my...
2384000	2386000	What are you fucking... God damn it.
2386000	2389000	You wear your Apple Watch like Rip Taylor decides to wear his toupee.
2389000	2392000	Sometimes yes, sometimes no.
2392000	2395000	It's like a hat you decide to wear sometimes.
2395000	2398000	Talk to each other.
2398000	2400000	What... are... who...
2400000	2401000	I can't...
2401000	2402000	Free B.O.
2402000	2404000	Wreckety B.
2404000	2405000	Wreckety B.
2405000	2407000	So, that brings us to Technology Corner.
2407000	2408000	You have the theme?
2408000	2409000	Technology Corner!
2417000	2421000	Steve Levy appeared like a fucking race.
2421000	2424000	That scared the absolute shit out of me.
2424000	2426000	What do you want with Steve Levy?
2426000	2427000	Say it in the mic.
2427000	2428000	Say it in the mic.
2428000	2429000	I can't say it in the mic.
2429000	2430000	You can't say it in the mic.
2430000	2431000	Say it in the mic.
2431000	2432000	Rob Shrab is here.
2432000	2434000	Oh, shit.
2434000	2436000	Oh...
2441000	2442000	Rob Shrab.
2442000	2444000	Oh, Rob Shrab.
2444000	2446000	Yeah.
2446000	2447000	Rob Shrab.
2447000	2449000	Rob Shrab.
2449000	2462000	All right, fantastic.
2462000	2464000	Rob Shrab.
2464000	2466000	Thanks for coming.
2466000	2469000	I feel like I invited you.
2469000	2471000	You guys were really...
2471000	2473000	You did do that, didn't you?
2473000	2475000	I feel like it, yeah.
2475000	2476000	You feel like what?
2476000	2478000	I invited you here.
2478000	2479000	No.
2479000	2480000	Because there was no guest tonight.
2480000	2481000	And then those guys both...
2481000	2482000	They came in the green room and I started to...
2482000	2483000	I was like, it's fine.
2483000	2484000	There's no guest.
2484000	2485000	It's good there's no guest.
2485000	2487000	And then these guys came in one by one.
2487000	2491000	Everybody, Levy, Jeff, Spencer, they were like, is there any guest?
2491000	2493000	And then I was like, no.
2493000	2497000	And then they each kept going like, did you try Dino?
2497000	2498000	Did you try...
2498000	2499000	Like all this stuff.
2499000	2500000	I was like, Jesus Christ, you guys.
2500000	2501000	I'm sorry.
2501000	2502000	I don't think I said that.
2502000	2503000	Just little old me.
2503000	2504000	But then you showed up with a miracle.
2504000	2505000	I like no guests.
2505000	2506000	I think some of our best shows.
2506000	2507000	I can leave.
2507000	2514000	I drove by a shrub today while he was walking his dog.
2514000	2516000	And then we texted back and forth.
2516000	2519000	And then it culminated in me just saying he should come on the show.
2519000	2527000	If you were in like earshot of me walking my dog, you could have heard me, Siri, going,
2527000	2530000	text Dungeon Master.
2530000	2533000	What do you want to say to Dungeon Master?
2533000	2536000	I love you.
2536000	2537000	It's true.
2537000	2540000	You have Spencer's name saved as Dungeon Master?
2540000	2541000	Yes.
2541000	2542000	I got Derek Mears.
2542000	2543000	This is Jason Voorhees.
2543000	2546000	We got Jack Black as Jack Austin.
2546000	2550000	I mean, it's kind of like the ultimate phone.
2550000	2552000	It really is the ultimate phone.
2552000	2555000	I'm jealous that you've been hanging out with Matt Berry this whole time.
2555000	2556000	It was pretty cool.
2556000	2557000	Yeah.
2557000	2558000	I didn't hang out the whole week.
2558000	2560000	Just the one night.
2560000	2563000	Because Toast of London is the goddamn funniest TV show of all time.
2563000	2565000	If you don't know it, Toast of motherfucking London.
2565000	2566000	Check it out.
2566000	2567000	Holy smoke.
2567000	2568000	That's funny.
2568000	2569000	Well, okay.
2569000	2570000	So that's what's been going on.
2570000	2571000	You're hanging out with Matt Berry.
2571000	2572000	Yeah.
2572000	2574000	Not bringing him by here.
2574000	2577000	Well, he left yesterday.
2577000	2578000	Because...
2578000	2580000	Of something I said?
2580000	2582000	Because of my show?
2582000	2583000	No, no, no.
2583000	2586000	Well, if I stay longer, I'll have to be on his podcast.
2586000	2587000	No.
2587000	2588000	He was in...
2588000	2591000	I want to go back to London.
2591000	2592000	No.
2592000	2598000	He was in Eureka for a month shooting a movie with Aubrey Plaza.
2598000	2603000	And now he just came here for a week to hang out.
2603000	2604000	I only saw him one day.
2604000	2605000	Did you get these yet?
2605000	2606000	Oh.
2606000	2607000	That's not...
2607000	2608000	Oh.
2608000	2609000	Wait.
2609000	2610000	What was that?
2610000	2611000	I'm curious about that.
2611000	2612000	That was an I think.
2612000	2613000	Are they pills?
2613000	2614000	Did you get these yet?
2614000	2615000	Are they...
2615000	2616000	Oh.
2616000	2617000	What are they?
2617000	2618000	Airbuds.
2618000	2619000	Is that what they're called?
2619000	2620000	Airbuds.
2620000	2623000	Airbuds are the dog that plays basketball.
2623000	2625000	They're called airbuds?
2625000	2628000	Thank God they got rid of the wires.
2628000	2633000	Because now you only look...
2633000	2640000	You only look like a complete douchebag.
2640000	2641000	He can't hear us.
2641000	2643000	He's lost in the groove.
2643000	2646000	I love music, but I would rather never hear music again
2646000	2648000	than be caught wearing those fucking things.
2648000	2651000	Carry on my way, Woodson.
2651000	2655000	There's just so much that wires offer in headphones.
2655000	2658000	What keeps them from falling out of your ear holes?
2658000	2659000	Well, the same thing that always did.
2659000	2660000	Your ears.
2660000	2661000	They're wedged in your ears.
2661000	2664000	But if they ever fell out, they haven't fallen out since 2010.
2664000	2665000	They changed the shape.
2665000	2666000	They wedge in their ears like little arrowheads.
2666000	2669000	But if you drop one, you're out of hole goddamn thing, right?
2669000	2672000	I don't wear those because I lost so much hearing
2672000	2673000	because of those.
2673000	2674000	The older one.
2674000	2676000	We'll get to that in a second.
2677000	2679000	Oh, the only thing I don't like about these...
2679000	2683000	I thought I was comfortable with Ray Kurzweil's singularity.
2683000	2687000	I'm ready to become part of the computer world.
2687000	2690000	But these things, they know when they're in your ear.
2690000	2691000	And I was like, I'm out.
2691000	2692000	Nope.
2692000	2694000	When you put them in, they go...
2694000	2698000	They make that activation sound of a Bluetooth device.
2698000	2699000	They go...
2699000	2701000	Why do you know you're in my ear?
2701000	2703000	What are you measuring?
2703000	2704000	Light?
2704000	2705000	Wax?
2705000	2707000	Spider eggs?
2707000	2709000	I was like, why don't they go...
2709000	2711000	When you put them in your pocket.
2711000	2714000	Maybe they do, we can't hear them.
2714000	2717000	They're just listening to your balls the whole day long.
2717000	2718000	They listen?
2718000	2721000	I thought they're supposed to put sound in your balls.
2721000	2725000	That's what they want you to think the whole time.
2725000	2727000	Well, I don't know.
2727000	2728000	I'm sure he's out on them.
2728000	2729000	I think they're kind of cool.
2729000	2730000	They got little cups.
2730000	2732000	Can you talk into them?
2732000	2733000	I don't know.
2734000	2736000	There's a bunch of spam in there.
2736000	2738000	I've done phone calls with them,
2738000	2740000	but I don't know where my sound is going.
2740000	2742000	You know, Steve wanted to know...
2742000	2744000	I think these are microphones down in the end.
2744000	2745000	That's cool.
2745000	2750000	Steve said that there is some new data about the new iPhone that's coming out.
2752000	2756000	Who's that cool guy with the white things hanging out of his ears?
2756000	2758000	Is that George Michael?
2758000	2759000	What is...
2759000	2760000	Wow.
2760000	2761000	Too soon?
2761000	2762000	I know.
2763000	2764000	Too soon.
2764000	2765000	We know.
2765000	2766000	We know it's not.
2766000	2769000	You brought me up too soon for me.
2769000	2771000	I'm George Michael.
2771000	2773000	You brought me up too soon.
2773000	2777000	I brought you up before you go-go.
2777000	2780000	See, that trivializes his death.
2780000	2782000	It's called paying tribute.
2782000	2783000	I love George Michael.
2783000	2786000	He was a huge philanthropist, and he was an awesome dude.
2786000	2787000	I paid tribute.
2787000	2788000	You mocked his death.
2789000	2792000	You yank a victim to one of his songs and incorporated his death into one of his songs.
2792000	2793000	There's a difference.
2793000	2795000	It's like those SNL weekend update jokes where they'd be like,
2795000	2798000	the creator of the Oreo died on Wednesday,
2798000	2803000	and his casket was buried between two slices of chocolate casket.
2803000	2806000	It's like, yeah, you've done this before.
2806000	2807000	That's a joke.
2807000	2809000	The joke is someone died, you horrible ghouls.
2809000	2811000	But kids are off-limit.
2813000	2815000	What have you been up to?
2815000	2816000	I'm just hanging out.
2816000	2818000	Get some errands done.
2818000	2821000	I've been putting off some errands over the last couple of years.
2821000	2825000	Getting to have a shelf I wanted to put up.
2825000	2827000	Got to put it up.
2827000	2828000	Kate couldn't do it by herself.
2828000	2830000	That shelf, that's a two-person job.
2830000	2831000	I did a-
2831000	2835000	Can't hold up one side of the shelf and the other side of the shelf.
2835000	2836000	One person.
2836000	2838000	Who did you have do it with you?
2838000	2839000	Matt Berry?
2839000	2840000	My wife.
2840000	2841000	Oh, okay.
2841000	2842000	I said Kate.
2842000	2843000	Put up a shelf.
2843000	2844000	Or I can hang out.
2844000	2852000	Or I can organize all my cables by color.
2852000	2854000	Whoa, it was a huge fucking cockroach.
2854000	2856000	It was the craziest, biggest cockroach.
2856000	2860000	A cockroach the size of Ted Danson.
2860000	2865000	A Ted Danson-sized cockroach?
2865000	2868000	Two stars of Creepshow.
2868000	2871000	A cockroach the size of Malin Ackerman.
2872000	2876000	I saw her name on the Super Bowl.
2876000	2881000	I was trying to fill my iCloud of references up with new shit.
2881000	2883000	I got those ear pods.
2883000	2885000	Wait, I can't see it.
2885000	2887000	There's a Ted Danson-sized cockroach.
2887000	2888000	It's under you.
2888000	2889000	It's under you.
2889000	2895000	Is he going to open up a bar after his failed baseball career?
2895000	2896000	Don't worry about it.
2896000	2897000	It's one of those-
2897000	2898000	Don't worry about it.
2898000	2899000	It's not going to do anything.
2899000	2902000	It's one of those L.A. cockroaches that says basically just a beetle.
2902000	2903000	It's like not really a cockroach.
2903000	2907000	Yeah, they don't do anything except be gross.
2907000	2908000	It's like a horseshoe crab.
2908000	2911000	Like a prehistoric horseshoe crab.
2911000	2912000	That made it better.
2917000	2920000	Well, technology corner, we did it with the ear pods.
2920000	2921000	Okay, fine.
2921000	2922000	And also-
2922000	2923000	Be careful with those.
2923000	2925000	I'm going to add this to the technology corner.
2925000	2929000	This comes to us from our people at Joe Rogan's desk.
2929000	2936000	A friend of mine heard on Joe Rogan's podcast that someone suggested there's a setting in your iPhone.
2936000	2940000	You can change all of the color to black and white.
2940000	2942000	You can remove all the color from your phone's display.
2942000	2944000	It spikes your dopamine a little bit less.
2944000	2947000	Makes it easier to put your phone down.
2947000	2948000	Oh, what is the code?
2948000	2949000	Life hacks.
2949000	2950000	What's the-
2950000	2954000	We used to make your phone less crucial to your life cycle.
2954000	2955000	What do you do?
2955000	2957000	Did you tap it with four fingers five times?
2957000	2958000	What's the code?
2958000	2960000	No, there's no shortcut that I know of.
2960000	2962000	And it's horrendously hidden in a bunch of-
2962000	2963000	It's an accessibility.
2963000	2964000	Accessibility features.
2964000	2966000	And then it's still from there.
2966000	2967000	You're like nine menus deep.
2967000	2968000	But you'll find it.
2968000	2969000	You'll be fine.
2969000	2970000	And then also, whatever.
2970000	2972000	I did it for a while and I was like-
2972000	2975000	But how am I going to play Bubble Witch if I can't tell which color the bubbles are?
2975000	2979000	And how will you know about her delicious crimson locks?
2979000	2980000	Did you get into Bubble Witch?
2980000	2981000	No, you showed it to me.
2981000	2982000	Yeah.
2983000	2984000	Dan asked me what game I was getting into.
2984000	2985000	I showed him Bubble Witch.
2985000	2988000	And it's a red-headed and tight, so he's blowing up bubbles.
2989000	2991000	I just got my kitty fountain updated.
2998000	2999000	That's awesome.
2999000	3002000	How's your health, your physical health?
3002000	3008000	You're somewhat notorious for your compulsive scrubbing of your butthole, scalding of it.
3008000	3010000	You had a parasite in your stomach at one point.
3010000	3011000	Yes.
3011000	3014000	When was the last time you scalded your butthole, Rob?
3014000	3016000	It's been a couple of years.
3016000	3018000	That's the thing of the past now.
3018000	3019000	Yeah, it's the thing of the past.
3019000	3020000	I've moved on.
3020000	3021000	I'm good.
3021000	3022000	You look thin as hell.
3022000	3024000	You look like Triple Jim Shrob back from the day.
3024000	3025000	I got a trainer again.
3025000	3026000	Oh, yeah?
3026000	3030000	We used to call him Triple Jim because he would go to the gym three times a day.
3030000	3033000	I was seriously crazy.
3033000	3035000	You're acting like he's just recently gone through some fat phase.
3035000	3036000	He's like, he's Shrob.
3036000	3037000	She's always been-
3037000	3040000	No, he looks leaner and meaner than-
3040000	3041000	I got a trainer.
3041000	3042000	He's like this-
3042000	3048000	I believe he's like this 28-year-old kid who just came from Texas or whatever.
3048000	3051000	He beats the shit out of me.
3051000	3053000	He just beats the shit out of me.
3053000	3054000	And then you guys go work out?
3054000	3055000	Sounds easy.
3055000	3056000	Yes.
3056000	3058000	Yeah.
3058000	3061000	Yeah, I wake up every morning, 5 o'clock.
3061000	3063000	I give him a nudge.
3063000	3066000	He beats the shit out of me.
3066000	3067000	And then you go do cross-training.
3067000	3068000	We go cross-training.
3069000	3070000	Do you know who he voted for?
3070000	3071000	No, I don't.
3071000	3074000	I don't have that conversation.
3074000	3077000	I've learned to not have that conversation.
3077000	3081000	What's been going on with you and your political part of your brain?
3081000	3082000	How are you handling this?
3082000	3083000	I don't like it.
3083000	3084000	I'm upset.
3084000	3086000	I'm really upset.
3086000	3089000	But mostly you're just into animal rights, I see on the Twitter.
3089000	3090000	Yes.
3090000	3093000	Everybody else is like, the judicial branch can't be dissolved.
3093000	3094000	Then we won't have checks and balances.
3094000	3098000	And you're like, this Shih Tzu needs help.
3098000	3099000	I'm not bagging on it.
3099000	3102000	You became a hardcore animal rights activist and full-on vegan, like straight up.
3102000	3103000	Yeah.
3103000	3104000	Yeah.
3104000	3105000	I love it.
3105000	3106000	Yep.
3106000	3107000	Yep.
3107000	3110000	Super popular with people.
3110000	3111000	I think, yeah.
3111000	3112000	Oh, it is.
3112000	3113000	It will be.
3113000	3114000	Is Kate a vegan too?
3114000	3117000	She's vegetarian but not vegan.
3117000	3118000	Yeah.
3118000	3119000	All right.
3119000	3120000	No.
3120000	3123000	Airbuds, black and white phone, lift.
3123000	3125000	Yeah, that's it.
3125000	3127000	We're out of show.
3127000	3130000	I want Rob to keep doing it when he was doing it.
3130000	3131000	I thought he was timing me.
3131000	3132000	Keep going then.
3132000	3133000	What is it?
3133000	3139000	Levy's like, you want me to tell people I bought a gun.
3139000	3140000	We could talk about-
3140000	3141000	You bought a gun?
3141000	3142000	You bought a gun.
3142000	3143000	We could talk about-
3143000	3144000	Why did you buy a gun?
3144000	3148000	Because you secretly want to kill somebody.
3148000	3149000	It's the only reason to buy a gun.
3149000	3153000	Because I secretly know that in the event that-
3153000	3156000	You're hoping for that event to happen so you could kill something.
3156000	3157000	That's not true at all.
3157000	3158000	You're a secret Charles Bronson.
3158000	3159000	You secretly-
3159000	3160000	No.
3160000	3164000	I've discussed this with my therapist and I have a right to buy a gun.
3164000	3170000	She said as long as it's not for you and it's not for anyone in the immediate future-
3170000	3172000	Well, it never starts out like that.
3172000	3173000	I know.
3174000	3177000	But in all fairness Dan's therapist is Sam Peckinpah.
3181000	3182000	We landed-
3182000	3186000	We didn't talk about this because in between San Francisco which was our last show and now
3186000	3193000	we flew in from San Francisco to LAX and it was like the airport was deserted because the protests had just started.
3193000	3195000	And we spent like five and a half hours.
3195000	3197000	Jeff was there longer.
3197000	3201000	Church showed up to take pictures but we were just there in the midst of this historical thing.
3201000	3203000	I'd never been at a protest.
3203000	3205000	I thought it was like-
3205000	3207000	I mean it was amazing.
3207000	3209000	I hate to sound like some weird tourist but that's literally what we were.
3209000	3210000	We had luggage.
3210000	3217000	And Jeff had his Vivian Westwood suits over his shoulder and his newsy cap and his fancy jacket.
3217000	3219000	And he kept like-
3219000	3222000	He was able to just go up to the cops and find out what's going on.
3222000	3223000	Like, hey what's going on?
3223000	3226000	And they're like, just protecting people's right to free speech you know.
3226000	3227000	It was a very-
3227000	3229000	There was a moment after you guys left.
3229000	3231000	We had an agreement with the police that we were like-
3231000	3232000	We got there.
3232000	3235000	We were blocking all of the traffic for-
3235000	3238000	We got to like, you know, probably six hours after it started.
3238000	3240000	We got there like around five or six o'clock.
3240000	3243000	It had been going on all day.
3243000	3245000	And we were blocking everything.
3245000	3247000	And then finally the police came in giant force.
3247000	3249000	All these cops came.
3249000	3254000	And if you follow Church on like Instagram or Facebook or whatever.
3254000	3257000	She's amazing photos of all these cops came.
3257000	3259000	And then they-
3259000	3262000	And the cops came from the direction that we weren't facing.
3262000	3268000	So you can very quickly go from texting, tweeting about how you're at a protest.
3268000	3270000	And you're so cool because you're at a protest.
3270000	3271000	It's like, huh.
3271000	3274000	Looks like people are protesting and they're chanting.
3274000	3275000	And here I am.
3275000	3278000	I'm just 60 minutes back here.
3278000	3282000	And then there's lights flashing because it's a concourse.
3282000	3286000	And then everyone turns around and you're like, everyone's facing my direction now.
3286000	3289000	Okay, phone away.
3289000	3293000	And just staring at riot shields like six feet away.
3293000	3298000	And then doing a double take and realizing the guy next to me is wearing a football helmet and a homemade-
3298000	3300000	I took a picture with him and tweeted it.
3300000	3303000	But it was like, I did a double take and that guy was like, hey, hi.
3303000	3310000	And he's like, huh, a little Rick and Morty.
3310000	3312000	And it was just like, holy fuck.
3312000	3314000	That guy with the homemade gas mask and the whole thing?
3314000	3315000	Yeah.
3315000	3316000	The Morty fan?
3316000	3317000	Yeah.
3317000	3318000	There were a lot of Rick and Morty fans.
3318000	3319000	Why was it homemade?
3319000	3320000	Why's he got a homemade-
3320000	3321000	He had a football helmet.
3321000	3325000	He had like a lacrosse helmet on with a Home Depot.
3325000	3326000	And he had a riot shield?
3326000	3327000	Like sawdust mask.
3327000	3328000	No, no.
3328000	3330000	He had a gas mask.
3330000	3333000	It was a mask you get at Home Depot for painting.
3333000	3334000	I think if you work in like-
3334000	3339000	These are our police.
3339000	3343000	No, this was another guy that was protesting next to me.
3343000	3345000	He's got a thing on his face.
3345000	3352000	He's anticipating activity that may involve him breathing tear gas or getting hit with
3352000	3353000	a baton.
3353000	3356000	How did you understand that he complimented you if he had a gas mask on?
3356000	3357000	That was my joke.
3357000	3358000	It was very muffled.
3358000	3359000	I love Rick and Morty.
3359000	3360000	So he didn't say it.
3360000	3361000	He did.
3361000	3365000	It's a popular show.
3365000	3367000	I'm not saying it, is it?
3367000	3369000	He might have said it's 740.
3369000	3371000	Most of the people were like, where's season three?
3371000	3375000	I was like, get back to protecting democracy for-
3375000	3377000	That was the only thing that called me.
3377000	3381000	These kids are fucking like really into my cartoon.
3381000	3383000	I don't know how to tell them.
3383000	3385000	My heart is pounding in my chest.
3385000	3388000	I'm like relocating my phone to different pockets.
3388000	3390000	I'm like, I think there's a bottle cap down here.
3390000	3395000	Could that cut my arterial arteries, which are the best kind of arteries?
3395000	3396000	Classic.
3396000	3398000	The classic arterial artery.
3398000	3402000	It says every- the new arterial artery.
3402000	3404000	It's arterial.
3404000	3406000	All right.
3406000	3408000	Don't use a venal artery.
3408000	3412000	You were looking for a bottle cap in your pocket.
3412000	3413000	I was like struggling.
3413000	3417000	I'm freaking out because I'm thinking I'm going to get arrested for the first time.
3417000	3422000	I'm going to get manhandled by people that aren't my family for the first time.
3422000	3425000	I'm going to get pepper sprayed.
3425000	3427000	I've had to pee for four hours.
3427000	3431000	I'm going straight to Buzzfeed or something.
3431000	3438000	I'm going to have pissed on my leg as I'm loaded like a Lincoln Log into a paddy wagon.
3438000	3441000	The other kids were just like, when's season three coming out?
3441000	3444000	I was like, well, I don't think they're very scared.
3444000	3446000	When is season three coming out?
3446000	3448000	They're-
3448000	3452000	I mean, you got to have a date and time.
3452000	3458000	I think it's time for the season three Rick and Morty update wrap.
3458000	3460000	You want a wrap?
3460000	3461000	Hang on a second.
3461000	3463000	Give me a second.
3463000	3464000	Have you been Dan?
3464000	3465000	Talk about things.
3465000	3466000	Have you been Dan?
3466000	3468000	I haven't seen you in a while.
3468000	3471000	I've been good.
3471000	3474000	What's going on?
3474000	3478000	They're drawing it.
3478000	3481000	They're drawing it.
3482000	3485000	They're drawing it.
3485000	3489000	Here's how cartoons work.
3489000	3491000	First you write them.
3491000	3493000	Then you draw them.
3493000	3497000	For a really long time.
3497000	3501000	Everything needs to be on paper.
3501000	3505000	So you can see it.
3505000	3511000	So if all I do is write it and then put it on TV-
3511000	3515000	It'll look like a script.
3522000	3526000	Instead of Rick and Morty, what you seem to like-
3526000	3533000	So when you ask me where it is, the answer is-
3533000	3536000	They're drawing it.
3536000	3541000	And when you tell me to stop being political and get back to drawing it-
3541000	3544000	I don't draw it.
3544000	3548000	I know it looks like I do.
3548000	3550000	That's called style.
3550000	3554000	Those artists are still actually talented and went to school.
3554000	3558000	If I literally drew it, the show wouldn't exist.
3558000	3562000	There's just the Batman fighting Garfield.
3562000	3564000	Those are the only things I know how to draw.
3564000	3566000	They would be illegal.
3566000	3570000	Unlike our blatant Back in the Future ripoff.
3570000	3573000	They're drawing it.
3573000	3576000	And they'll be drawing it.
3576000	3578000	Until they're done drawing it.
3578000	3580000	And then-
3580000	3583000	Adult Swim will cheers when to air it.
3583000	3584000	Not me!
3584000	3586000	Because I don't own a network.
3586000	3588000	It's called TV.
3588000	3590000	The T is for television.
3590000	3596000	V is for very much not my decision.
3596000	3598000	When to air things.
3598000	3602000	Because remember how you learned who I am?
3602000	3607000	I'm the guy who writes and produces things that end up-
3607000	3610000	Not on TV a lot.
3610000	3615000	Because I don't control whether things are on TV or not.
3616000	3620000	If I did, we'd be in season 9 of Community.
3620000	3623000	And it would be 48 episodes a year.
3623000	3629000	And there would also just be shows about me taking a shit.
3629000	3632000	I would be at every show.
3632000	3635000	Because I don't- I'm gonna stop when you say stop.
3635000	3639000	I'm gonna fuck your mama like the head of a mop.
3639000	3642000	A hip hop to the hip hop.
3642000	3645000	One day, Superman came down.
3645000	3646000	He said-
3646000	3649000	I'm Superman so comparatively you're a clown.
3649000	3650000	I said-
3656000	3659000	Superman got his woofers and tweeters out.
3659000	3663000	I said motherfucker democracy is gonna shout.
3663000	3666000	With your titties out.
3666000	3669000	A roundabout.
3669000	3671000	I got the gout.
3672000	3676000	Superman ate too much rich food.
3676000	3679000	Heavy creams and sauces.
3679000	3683000	He thought he was impervious to them because he's Superman.
3683000	3684000	A lot of people don't know.
3684000	3688000	Totally normal internal digestive system.
3688000	3692000	He can succumb to things like gout.
3692000	3697000	A lot of people say gout is Superman's kryptonite.
3697000	3700000	From a strictly dietary standpoint.
3700000	3707000	However, gout could never actually kill him.
3707000	3709000	Because he's-
3709000	3711000	Shrabs on his phone.
3711000	3713000	He's fucking shut down.
3713000	3715000	Anyways.
3715000	3717000	They're drawing it.
3722000	3724000	They're drawing it.
3725000	3729000	And while they're drawing it I'm making a million things.
3729000	3731000	And they take a long time to make.
3731000	3735000	And Spencer's fucking killing it on Harmon Quest season two.
3737000	3740000	Straight up like-
3740000	3745000	If I thought for a second that there was a little bit of it that was gonna be bad.
3745000	3747000	I wouldn't set him up by saying that.
3747000	3749000	It was like totally his show.
3749000	3750000	He's like running it.
3750000	3751000	I showed up.
3751000	3752000	I played D&D.
3752000	3756000	And he's fucking like him and his huge team of awesome people that worked on season one.
3756000	3757000	I saw that.
3757000	3759000	I'm so excited about Harmon Quest.
3759000	3760000	I'm not saying-
3760000	3761000	There's nothing.
3761000	3763000	Don't let that show up in an article where it's like,
3763000	3764000	here's why Rick and Morty's late.
3764000	3766000	Dan's excited about Harmon Quest.
3766000	3767000	It's not related.
3767000	3769000	They're drawing it.
3770000	3771000	They have to draw the things.
3771000	3773000	I will say and did say.
3773000	3775000	The reason it was late.
3775000	3780000	The reason they gotta late start drawing it is because I am fucking slow and shitty
3780000	3781000	and unpredictable as a writer.
3781000	3783000	The buck stops here with that.
3783000	3785000	I'm done with that part.
3785000	3788000	You can't now tell me to go faster.
3788000	3789000	It doesn't make any sense.
3789000	3794000	I confessed to my crimes after it was too late to make me change.
3794000	3796000	You're yelling at the audience.
3797000	3799000	You're yelling at them.
3799000	3802000	Anyways, it's 9-11 probably.
3804000	3805000	Is it 9-11?
3805000	3807000	It looks like 9-10.
3808000	3809000	Too soon.
3809000	3810000	Too soon.
3810000	3813000	Moment of silence for the bowling green massacre victims.
3813000	3814000	Oh my God.
3818000	3821000	Are you booing my mainstream political jokes?
3824000	3825000	You could have stopped it.
3825000	3827000	Do you have any actual political jokes?
3827000	3829000	Let's do a Dan Harmon joke corner.
3829000	3830000	Will you tell a joke?
3830000	3831000	Yeah.
3835000	3836000	Doesn't that have to be political?
3836000	3839000	Any just proper joke joke?
3839000	3841000	Oh, I thought it was a political joke.
3841000	3842000	Oh, if you've got one.
3842000	3843000	Yeah, lay it on us.
3843000	3844000	All right.
3844000	3851000	So, Kellyanne Conway walks into a chamber.
3855000	3857000	That's how all good jokes start.
3858000	3863000	And there's a vortex in it.
3864000	3866000	A door to the south.
3873000	3876000	And there's other people in there.
3877000	3880000	She wants to save them because they're Nazis or something.
3880000	3884000	And so she says, I'll tell you what.
3884000	3887000	You guys run.
3887000	3890000	And I'll put the vortex where my soul should be.
3890000	3896000	And they say, but how will you keep your physical form
3896000	3902000	from desiccating in this really on-the-nose evil way?
3902000	3904000	How will you keep yourself from looking
3904000	3907000	like an over-the-top sorceress?
3907000	3911000	As if there's weird permanent mascara tears
3911000	3916000	going down the lines where your veins supply blood
3916000	3921000	to your eyeballs from a heart that may just be a black rock
3921000	3924000	that glows and pulses rather than beating.
3924000	3925000	And she's like, I don't know.
3925000	3928000	I'll just deal with it.
3928000	3929000	And they run.
3929000	3930000	All the Nazis run.
3930000	3931000	And they're like, yay, we're free.
3931000	3934000	We made it out of that chamber where there was a vortex.
3934000	3937000	And then she's like, I made it too.
3937000	3938000	And they're like, but you...
3938000	3939000	By the way, if you guys have heard this,
3939000	3944000	you can stop them at any time.
3944000	3950000	No, but I don't have any political jokes.
3950000	3954000	I didn't mean to stop you.
3954000	3956000	It's really hard not to make fun of Kelly and Conway's
3956000	3957000	appearance because you...
3957000	3959000	But it's like one of those reasons.
3959000	3961000	She looks like the lead singer of Hany Rux.
3961000	3964000	It's a catch-22 because you're like, you know what?
3964000	3965000	Part of this is you want to be woke.
3965000	3966000	You want to be on the right team.
3966000	3968000	It's like we want to live in a world.
3969000	3972000	So you're using tools that the enemy uses to just go like,
3972000	3973000	oh, she's an ugly woman.
3973000	3975000	Like, well, that's not really the point.
3975000	3976000	It's just more like she looks evil.
3976000	3977000	Yeah.
3977000	3981000	No, the president of the United States, fat and feminine,
3981000	3983000	everything possible, shamed everybody.
3983000	3985000	We're allowed to say he has a giant ass and she looks like
3985000	3988000	the lead singer of Hany Rux.
3988000	3989000	Yeah.
3989000	3991000	But you can hear it's not going over well.
3991000	3992000	Because they don't...
3992000	3995000	Just look up the lead singer of Hany Rux.
3995000	3996000	All right.
3996000	3997000	It's like picture pages.
3997000	4000000	Like, there's supplemental material to our entertainment.
4000000	4002000	There was this thing called picture pages,
4002000	4006000	starring a man that turned out to be a famous rapist.
4008000	4010000	He was so famous for rape.
4011000	4012000	Well, he is...
4012000	4014000	I'm saying he turned out he ended up a famous...
4014000	4016000	More famous for that than pudding.
4016000	4017000	Yeah.
4017000	4019000	You got to admit.
4019000	4020000	Yeah.
4020000	4023000	He's the second least powerful rapist in America right now.
4027000	4030000	Who's the least powerful rapist in America?
4030000	4031000	Second most.
4031000	4032000	Oh, okay.
4032000	4033000	There we go.
4033000	4036000	Let's check in with Spencer and see what's going on in China.
4036000	4037000	Hey, guys.
4037000	4039000	I got these pickles.
4039000	4040000	This isn't...
4040000	4041000	We can't carry on.
4041000	4042000	Why'd you bring pickles?
4042000	4043000	They're great.
4043000	4044000	Where'd you get the pickles?
4044000	4046000	From Artist and Cheese Gallery.
4046000	4048000	Spencer's into pickles now.
4048000	4050000	Hey, go to Baller Hardware.
4050000	4052000	They sell pickles at the hardware store.
4052000	4053000	No, they don't.
4053000	4054000	I know.
4054000	4056000	They sell pickles at the hardware store, and I went...
4056000	4059000	Why are you selling pickles at the hardware store?
4059000	4062000	And they said, because they're fucking good, man.
4063000	4064000	Baller Hardware?
4064000	4067000	Let me try some of these pickles.
4067000	4070000	And I finished the jar.
4070000	4072000	They're good, man.
4072000	4073000	That sounds great.
4073000	4075000	You got to get these pickles, man.
4075000	4078000	Are they their own brand of pickles, the hardware store people?
4079000	4080000	No.
4081000	4083000	They're just name-brand pickles?
4083000	4084000	Are they stock?
4084000	4086000	No, they're not name-brand.
4086000	4091000	I guess they're made in Silver Lake by a friend of the guy who owns the hardware store.
4091000	4092000	Oh, that's awesome.
4092000	4095000	So I can go get some keys made by some light bulbs.
4095000	4096000	Get some pickles.
4096000	4097000	Get some pickles.
4097000	4098000	Get some pickles.
4098000	4099000	This sounds like one-stop shopping.
4099000	4100000	And leave.
4100000	4101000	Yeah.
4101000	4105000	They got the small baby pickles, and then they got the larger ones, too.
4105000	4106000	So you really are...
4106000	4108000	I get one of each.
4109000	4112000	Spencer, can I try one of your pickles?
4112000	4114000	Yeah, they're in the back.
4114000	4115000	I bet Steve could bring them up.
4115000	4117000	Can you bring out these pickles?
4117000	4119000	Steve, would you bring out the goddamn pickles?
4119000	4123000	You really are getting into home improvement, which is funny, because when I got fired from community,
4123000	4125000	I started hanging shelves and shit.
4125000	4127000	It was like some weird impulse.
4127000	4129000	And are we allowed to talk about the fact that...
4129000	4132000	Well, it's all over the place if I know what you're talking about.
4132000	4135000	Your relationship with Lego has reached a conclusion.
4135000	4136000	Now you're putting up shelves.
4136000	4137000	That's what I did after the community.
4137000	4141000	Yes, I had a lot of errands that I've been putting off,
4141000	4144000	and I had to leave Lego to put up some shelves.
4144000	4145000	Do my laundry.
4145000	4146000	What do we got here?
4146000	4149000	There's ones that are peppers and ones that are pickles.
4149000	4150000	Oh, these are fucking delicious.
4150000	4151000	Right.
4151000	4152000	They're so good.
4152000	4153000	Did you just eat a pepper or a pickle?
4153000	4155000	I think that was a pickle one he grabbed.
4155000	4156000	Give me some of them.
4156000	4158000	It's almost like a bread and butter pickle.
4158000	4161000	Yeah, it's the only thing that's a sweet pickle.
4161000	4162000	Oh, God, enjoy.
4162000	4164000	I mean, I would put that on a sandwich, or I just eat them.
4164000	4165000	Right, you just eat them straight.
4165000	4166000	They're great.
4166000	4168000	I want to eat some of these pickles.
4168000	4169000	All right.
4169000	4172000	Is there anyone in the audience?
4172000	4173000	They're spicy, too.
4173000	4174000	Yeah, they're spicy, too.
4174000	4176000	Oh, I eat some pickles.
4176000	4177000	Get a pickle.
4177000	4179000	People paid $10 for this show.
4179000	4180000	Oh, my God.
4180000	4182000	They paid $10, waited in line.
4182000	4187000	But right now, if you are a new subscriber to the livestream,
4187000	4190000	your subscription fee goes to the ACLU.
4190000	4192000	We match your donation.
4192000	4194000	We don't send your money to the ACLU.
4194000	4195000	We're going to match your donation.
4195000	4197000	I guess that's a legal thing.
4197000	4198000	We match it.
4198000	4200000	If you subscribe now to the live feed,
4200000	4204000	we're going to match all of your money until the march,
4204000	4208000	when we find out that Donald Trump is a bad person on the tax march.
4208000	4211000	But we haven't found out if he's a bad person yet.
4211000	4212000	Yeah.
4212000	4214000	We're going to hope to find that out one day.
4214000	4217000	Is there anybody in the audience that,
4217000	4221000	and since it's been kind of a sausage tea party up here?
4221000	4224000	Name Thomas C. Howell.
4224000	4227000	I will go with a lady's first rule.
4227000	4229000	But I'm just more curious.
4229000	4231000	Is there anybody in the audience who's kind of like,
4231000	4234000	say, a veteran protester, somebody who's
4234000	4239000	been at more than five protests?
4239000	4240000	Nobody.
4240000	4241000	Four protests.
4241000	4243000	Well, that's important to know, too.
4243000	4246000	I mean, you guys are like me.
4246000	4248000	We've entered new times where like-
4248000	4249000	Lower the number.
4249000	4253000	What about a woman that was saw women here that were at the women's march?
4253000	4254000	Oh, you're just coming up.
4254000	4256000	You didn't raise your hand, but you're-
4256000	4257000	No, it's fine.
4257000	4258000	No, it's fine.
4258000	4259000	And you definitely-
4259000	4260000	Yeah, you look like a protester.
4260000	4263000	Come on up.
4263000	4264000	What's your name?
4264000	4265000	Harry.
4265000	4266000	Harry?
4266000	4267000	Okay.
4267000	4268000	It's Harry, everybody.
4268000	4269000	Hey, everyone.
4269000	4271000	Do you want a pickle?
4271000	4273000	No, I actually really don't like pickles.
4273000	4274000	I will take a vote.
4274000	4276000	You'll love these pickles.
4276000	4278000	These pickles are pretty good, man.
4278000	4279000	Pickles are like cats.
4279000	4281000	Everyone thinks I'll love their cat.
4281000	4283000	Everyone thinks I'll love their pickles.
4283000	4287000	Well, everyone's cats are bad, but these pickles are good.
4287000	4290000	So, Harry, these pickles are off the fucking deep end, Harry.
4290000	4292000	Treat yourself to one of these pickles.
4292000	4294000	I'm going to stick with no pickles.
4294000	4297000	Take the pickles.
4297000	4299000	I'm protesting these pickles.
4299000	4300000	I'm protesting them.
4300000	4306000	Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink that dill juice, Harry.
4306000	4309000	Harry, drink that dill juice.
4309000	4312000	Come on, you fucking pussy.
4312000	4314000	Drink that dill juice, man.
4314000	4316000	No, I mean, I'm definitely scared to drink that.
4316000	4317000	No, drink it.
4317000	4319000	Drink that dill juice.
4319000	4321000	Fucking Harry, drink it.
4321000	4323000	Fucking pussy, man.
4323000	4326000	Harry's not drinking the dill juice.
4326000	4328000	Drink that dill juice.
4328000	4330000	No.
4330000	4331000	All right.
4331000	4336000	On the graph, the amount of laughs or time spent on this bit,
4336000	4340000	we peaked and now we're going to ride downhill into the next segment.
4340000	4341000	Harry.
4341000	4342000	Yes.
4342000	4344000	So, it was my first protest.
4344000	4346000	I had to be flown into it.
4346000	4347000	I was also there.
4347000	4348000	Were you there at the LAX?
4348000	4349000	Yeah.
4349000	4352000	When we shut that shit down, arrivals and departures.
4352000	4355000	But I was also there like days prior and after.
4355000	4356000	Fuck you, high road.
4356000	4358000	No, this isn't for use for them.
4358000	4360000	You got off on an airplane.
4360000	4363000	I was flown in with luggage.
4363000	4364000	No, people like.
4364000	4370000	I was like, hell no, we won't go, not until my dog sitter is off duty.
4370000	4374000	I don't know if it's because some get more attraction than others on social media, but
4374000	4378000	people seem to arbitrarily choose when to go to things that are consistent.
4378000	4382000	The Women's March was a set thing that happened at a time on a day.
4382000	4387000	LAX was like, we kind of need you here always because planes keep coming in and people keep
4387000	4388000	being detained.
4388000	4393000	If you're trying to be there to just be a physical body of support, that's always needed
4393000	4396000	until this shit changes.
4396000	4400000	Well, I'm going to skip over a topic that'll make me babble for too long and put my foot
4400000	4407000	in my mouth, which is, but to hold the pin, I want to get back to this topic after the
4407000	4414000	next one, which is white people need to go to protest more than other people.
4414000	4420000	White people sitting at their keyboard at home are doing three times as much by not
4420000	4425000	doing anything because society is unfair.
4425000	4428000	I said I wouldn't talk about it, but put a pin in that.
4428000	4430000	White people need to go to more protests.
4430000	4437000	Put a pin in it, Harry, and move that pin in accordance with the LAPD's wishes every
4437000	4438000	five minutes.
4438000	4439000	That's my next topic.
4439000	4442000	I'm going to eat a fucking pickles.
4442000	4446000	Obviously, the LAPD has more experience than any protestor out there.
4446000	4452000	As an organization, maybe not the actual cool cucumbers, the very ethnically diverse
4452000	4455000	cool cucumbers they put out on the front lines.
4455000	4460000	I mean, as human beings, I got to say, the first thing that hits your mind as a first
4460000	4466000	time protestor being there was like, I love these protesters and I love the LAPD.
4466000	4468000	It was like this weird thing.
4468000	4474000	But then throughout the evening, by the time I got home, I was like, oh, we got played.
4475000	4477000	It's like, oh, peaceful protest, peaceful protest.
4477000	4480000	Everyone was so proud of how peaceful the protest was.
4480000	4485000	Well, the protest was peaceful because the protest was run by the LAPD.
4485000	4489000	Every time somebody started chanting fuck the police, everybody would go like peaceful
4489000	4491000	protest, peaceful protest.
4491000	4495000	We wouldn't want anyone to get arrested, tear gassed, all these things.
4495000	4500000	It's really tough because basically the protesters ended up making a deal with the LAPD.
4500000	4503000	They were in constant contact with them, which I thought was a glorious thing.
4503000	4505000	There is a positivity to that, right?
4505000	4509000	There is a positive message that that sends, especially when the cops aren't the ones holding
4509000	4510000	the detainees.
4510000	4513000	I know you're asking, you're going like, Dan, what is your question?
4513000	4514000	No, no.
4514000	4517000	But like the LAPD isn't in charge of the detainees.
4517000	4523000	And so they were like, so they're working with them, cooperating with them, it actually
4523000	4529000	does provide these like spine tingling opportunities to be like, hey, maybe you guys should be
4529000	4530000	over here too.
4530000	4536000	You are all like a rainbow of people descended from whose family tree goes up two feet without
4536000	4537000	an immigrant in it.
4537000	4539000	You're just wearing riot gear because that's your job.
4539000	4540000	Like get over here.
4540000	4543000	And it's like there's moments where it was like, they might do it.
4543000	4546000	I saw an airport cop, technically not LAPD.
4546000	4552000	I forget the exact distinctions there, but he cried when one of the detainees got released.
4552000	4555000	And then I called him on it and he quickly got really macho about it and like wiped his
4555000	4556000	shirt.
4556000	4559000	So Jeff's girlfriend took some great pictures of, uh, she could just be church.
4559000	4562000	She doesn't have a Jeff's girlfriend.
4562000	4566000	What a fucking horrible society this is.
4566000	4571000	Uh, she loves, she, she, she, she got there too late in the game to like, if she had been
4571000	4576000	there and she's an amazing photographer, like, like, like it, nothing, nothing makes you
4576000	4580000	realize other than more than photos, like how the history that we're living and you
4580000	4581000	see it.
4581000	4582000	Cause it looks like time magazine.
4582000	4583000	Let's bring church up.
4583000	4584000	She's sitting right here.
4584000	4585000	Yeah.
4585000	4588000	Church over Cassandra church.
4588000	4594000	The, the, the pictures, the pictures that you took of that young lady who had like,
4594000	4599000	she had decided to focus her emotional energy on one cop as if that itself were a weapon,
4599000	4601000	like a quote unquote weapon.
4601000	4602000	It's not destructive.
4602000	4608000	She was just, that was a probably both a tactic and a very sincere thing because she was unmistakably
4608000	4609000	sincere.
4609000	4611000	And the cop, you said, well, you describe it.
4611000	4616000	Well, it was when I first got there and, um, as you say, you know, they were in the
4616000	4619000	street for a little while and then bringing people back up onto the sidewalk.
4619000	4624000	And at this point, this is when all the police started pushing everybody back up onto the
4624000	4625000	sidewalk.
4625000	4630000	And this one particular girl caught my eye because as a photographer, I pushed my way
4630000	4634000	to the front to try to get a view of everyone facing the police.
4634000	4641000	And this one girl was just glued on this guy and she had just tears like rolling down
4641000	4642000	her face.
4642000	4649000	And her sign said, um, like Syria, Yemen, Iran, welcome here with a heart.
4649000	4652000	She was sobbing and sobbing and sobbing.
4652000	4656000	I was like leaning off the curb practically onto an officer who just kind of like leaned
4656000	4660000	back and acted like I wasn't doing it because he could see what I saw and what I was trying
4660000	4661000	to photograph.
4661000	4662000	They were being very nice to photographers.
4662000	4664000	They were being incredibly nice to photographers.
4664000	4669000	At one point I was on the, I was on an overpass looking down at these guys and they were smiling
4669000	4672000	and waving and laughing and taking photos of me with their phones.
4672000	4674000	And then they were all just on Instagram.
4674000	4675000	They were hanging out.
4675000	4676000	They were fine.
4676000	4678000	There was absolutely no problem.
4678000	4683000	But I couldn't hear what was being said between the girl and the officer in front of her,
4683000	4686000	but he was whispering to her and trying to calm her down.
4686000	4692000	And they were having some conversation that I, I couldn't hear from my, where I was standing,
4692000	4694000	but he seemed to be consoling her.
4694000	4696000	Right.
4696000	4699000	She was pleading something with him and trying to get him to understand.
4699000	4701000	And I, from what I could tell by their gestures.
4701000	4703000	Probably something along the lines of I'm just doing my job.
4703000	4704000	Right.
4704000	4706000	And he's probably saying something like, I know I understand it.
4706000	4707000	I'm just doing my job.
4707000	4708000	Yeah.
4708000	4709000	Like it's okay.
4709000	4710000	Just stay back on the curb.
4710000	4714000	And that could be the most important interaction that you have with, with, with, with police
4714000	4716000	is getting them to admit that they're just doing their job.
4716000	4720000	Reminding them that that the whole time, because that means they don't have to be mad.
4720000	4724000	They don't have to be, but, but on the flip side of that.
4724000	4728000	So that's why I wanted to have a hanky face as now I call them.
4728000	4732000	Cause I was like, looking around like these hanky faces, they're, they're, you know,
4732000	4735000	are the hankies for an anonymity or tear gas?
4735000	4738000	People have, people have their own reasons for them.
4738000	4741000	So a lot of us just, there's also an argument.
4741000	4746000	I can't defend it for various reasons or like object it to it.
4746000	4750000	There's some articles going around about how like masking up is a form of white privilege
4750000	4753000	because if you're a white person, then you still blend into the crowd.
4753000	4758000	Whereas like, if there's only a few people of color at the thing, they're easier to identify.
4758000	4759000	I didn't even follow it.
4759000	4760000	I didn't track that at all.
4760000	4764000	It's, it's just some 2017 internet race commentary.
4764000	4769000	I would say at this age, I think there's probably it's rooted like masking up is rooted in anonymity.
4769000	4770000	It's okay.
4770000	4772000	Cause like you're, cause it's not going to filter out.
4772000	4773000	No, not at all, not at all.
4773000	4779000	Certain things will like the, the Home Depot guy who I also saw like his, his would have helped out a bit.
4779000	4783000	But yeah, I mean, if they throw tear gas, your sunglasses and fabric aren't going to do shit.
4783000	4790000	So before church got there, this is what happened, which I, and I think this could be a microcosm of what we're all facing.
4790000	4796000	If we're all going to be protesting and marching, it's like, this is a really difficult thing because there was an exhilaration in the air.
4796000	4800000	And part of the pride on the part of the protesters was in no uncertain terms.
4800000	4806000	The fact that we were working in what you have to call cooperation with the LAPD, that felt like a triumph.
4806000	4810000	Now you're dealing with the police department that has been at a million of these.
4810000	4818000	And they, and so, and, and, and you, but on the other hand, all of these individual police officers are human beings as are the protesters.
4818000	4825000	But when I get home and I see basically that the protest got successfully broken up, you know, and I look back and it was like,
4825000	4829000	there was this moment where we were all standing and blocking the upper concourse.
4829000	4835000	And, and the, one of the megaphone people said, you know, here's the deal.
4835000	4839000	The cops are saying, so far we haven't broken the law.
4839000	4842000	They have, because they haven't issued a disperse order.
4842000	4845000	When they issue a disperse order, we have a decision to make.
4846000	4858000	Are we going to become criminals and turn this into a thing that's going to end up being a news item about how we were criminals and how the crime had to be put down.
4858000	4862000	On the, alternatively, they've offered us a deal.
4862000	4874000	They've said that we can stand on the sidewalk for 15 minutes or 30 minutes and then disrupt for 10 minutes and then do that in alternation.
4874000	4883000	And there was a pause and then someone called out, 15, 15 minutes, 20, 20, 15.
4883000	4890000	And it turned to the prices right about, about how we're going to, we got the nuts here.
4890000	4893000	And I was like, I'm not, I'm not disparaging that.
4893000	4895000	I'm just pointing out the absurdity of it.
4895000	4913000	Because, because what happened was a wedge got driven in between, in between the people that, that have done this before and were not necessarily hoping things would deteriorate, but at the same time, probably that were prepared for it.
4913000	4916000	And that's always going to be a smaller group.
4916000	4919000	And so that was a really, that is a tactic, right?
4919000	4930000	Because they, rather than bother throwing tear gas at a large group of people that feel solidified to stay in communication with them and to say, oh, we love Shay Guevara.
4930000	4932000	Shay Guevara is your spokesman.
4932000	4933000	We just talked to Shay Guevara.
4933000	4935000	Shay, tell your people what we're telling them.
4935000	4939000	We're telling you, you can have free bananas if you give us half of your guns.
4939000	4948000	And then there's like all of this stuff like starts to, you, you, you foment like a conversation in among the protesters before that the car, there was no conversation.
4948000	4954000	I feel like if there were a couple of things that were made that specific.
4954000	4960000	One, it was if like, you know, church that you, you were at the Ferguson protests here in LA.
4960000	4961000	Yeah.
4961000	4963000	And it was a very different thing.
4963000	4967000	If it was all, if it was 2000 black people at the airport, I think it would have been different.
4967000	4970000	And also if it weren't an airport, it would have been different.
4970000	4976000	They don't want to start putting chemical like agents out into an airport.
4976000	4978000	But all that is to say that we had the leverage.
4978000	4979000	They had the airport shut down.
4979000	4983000	Now, I don't know what our leverage translated to, but sorry, go ahead.
4983000	4995000	There's also a difference between a protest like the women's March, where it's organized, it's in the daytime, they block off streets and everybody knows where it's going to be and where the people will be going generally and what the plan is.
4995000	4996000	Right.
4996000	5004000	And that is at night, people just taking to the street because they're angry or people showing up to a place like the airport that already has high security.
5004000	5005000	Okay.
5005000	5011000	So the reaction is completely different by a police force coming out to try to contain and make sure that that's under control.
5011000	5013000	And where there's multiple law enforcement agencies.
5013000	5014000	Right.
5014000	5015000	Right.
5015000	5021000	What I'm wondering is then what was, because what happened was there were some hardcore elements that were like, no, then nothing happens.
5021000	5022000	This is how they drive a wedge.
5022000	5025000	And then there were my like, here I am, 44.
5025000	5026000	I got I'm hungry.
5026000	5029000	My dogs are about to start pissing in the house.
5029000	5030000	I've been there for five hours.
5030000	5034000	Like I didn't want the last thing I wanted to do is be a pussy.
5034000	5037000	But you didn't see the girl who brought burritos.
5037000	5039000	No, there was there was plenty of food.
5039000	5041000	You left right before the burrito guy came.
5041000	5045000	She brought a bunch of fucking burritos to the extent that I'm up in the air.
5045000	5049000	Like a situation got created where now conversations are starting to happen.
5049000	5050000	Like logic was invited.
5050000	5061000	And I remember distinctly the moment where I felt at peace with stepping off of the street and under the sidewalk, i.e. basically surrendering.
5061000	5072000	The moment where I felt that that was OK, where I wouldn't then go home and hate myself for giving in, was because there were like only a couple of people left who were arguing with each other.
5072000	5078000	And one of them was screaming at the ones who wanted to stay and sit and get arrested.
5078000	5081000	It's not about you.
5081000	5082000	And she's not wrong.
5082000	5084000	There was this messaging that was put into it.
5084000	5089000	It was like, do we want the detainees to be in the newspaper newspaper?
5089000	5090000	Do it.
5090000	5091000	Do it.
5091000	5092000	Do whatever.
5092000	5093000	The huff pose.
5093000	5094000	The laser beam.
5094000	5095000	The hologram.
5095000	5096000	The pokemons.
5096000	5102000	Do we want the story to be about the detainees or do we want it to be about how a bunch of hippies got stun gunned at the airport?
5102000	5103000	OK.
5103000	5104000	So now.
5104000	5105000	So.
5105000	5106000	So.
5106000	5107000	So.
5107000	5108000	All the talking.
5108000	5110000	But I want to be like here's the thing.
5110000	5111000	First protest.
5111000	5112000	Forty four years old.
5112000	5115000	Like so used to always doing the wrong thing.
5115000	5119000	Like I always like think that I'm like, oh, sounds like this.
5119000	5121000	And then I'll like be so embarrassed.
5121000	5128000	That's when I was like, OK, I now have permission to step on the sidewalk because this very passionate young woman is going like it's not about you.
5128000	5130000	And she's talking to like four or five people.
5130000	5135000	And like I don't know and I won't know until someone else tells me.
5136000	5140000	Whether it's the right thing to do to sit here, sit down or leave.
5140000	5141000	I was like, I do.
5141000	5144000	Well, what if I undercut the fucking cause?
5144000	5149000	It's like a community creator and famous fat guy there.
5149000	5152000	It's like what if that ends up like being some kind of counter messaging or whatever.
5152000	5154000	So now talk to me.
5154000	5155000	Tell me what to do.
5155000	5156000	I think.
5156000	5164000	Well, sort of contrary to that request, I think it's important no matter which side of an issue you're on not to tell other people protesting.
5164000	5174000	The same thing, how to protest, whether that means if someone wants to get arrested for their cause, let them make that decision.
5174000	5180000	And if someone wants to chant a chant and hold a sign, let them make that decision.
5180000	5190000	I think it's important to know what you're trying to accomplish and if what you're doing is everything you could be doing to accomplish that.
5190000	5202000	So like if you if you want to make real change in government policy, holding a sign, enchanting a chant isn't going to do that.
5202000	5206000	Because they've now incorporated that into their system if they hadn't already 60 years ago.
5206000	5216000	And it's just like that's that's you being by going to the airport, you're being a physical body supporting a message as well as actual people who are detained.
5216000	5224000	But like if you have any illusions that what you're doing in that is really affecting larger change, which I think was one thing.
5224000	5230000	Some people gave the women's march kind of a bad rep for this, but I thought it was cool that they almost owned up to like we don't have a list of demands.
5230000	5236000	We just want to make sure you know we're here and we're not fucking cool with this stuff, which I thought was so that was the most important thing.
5236000	5237000	You could look at it.
5237000	5239000	Body count was the thing that was important.
5239000	5248000	It was flesh scraping cement poured into the streets at every city around the world that really got to our enemy.
5248000	5258000	So like if if if you go to a protest and the police give you a directive, it's basically just up to you to assess what it is you're trying to do.
5258000	5263000	And if listening to that directive or disobeying it is going to further your cause.
5263000	5270000	So like if you're there just for moral support, maybe don't get arrested or do like that's your choice.
5270000	5278000	But it's not going to if you get arrested, you're not going to be able to be the body there showing your support.
5278000	5281000	So what you know, so what do you think you were there?
5281000	5286000	Did you and so you were like, you know what, for what we've done, we shut down the airport.
5286000	5289000	The like like like L.A.X. is not the epicenter of this.
5289000	5290000	The LAPD is not in charge.
5290000	5296000	Did you you thought it was cool to just like shrink back and kind of like continue to have a presence there?
5296000	5300000	It's like it becomes kind of a picket line in the sense that it's like a physical reminder.
5300000	5308000	Yeah, it sort of comes up to you also like having had been there for over a day already and knowing I was going to continue to be there like those cops work long shifts.
5308000	5311000	They come to recognize people who are there enough.
5311000	5320000	If I'm going to continue to be there and do what I think is my best foot forward to help my cause or whatever, getting arrested doesn't help that.
5320000	5323000	These cops recognize me already as the guy who's been here all week.
5323000	5326000	Like it's not useful for me to step to them.
5326000	5327000	I know they're the enemy.
5327000	5329000	How much time have you spent out there?
5329000	5331000	Actually, you've been there for multiple days.
5331000	5332000	Yeah. Yeah.
5332000	5337000	I haven't been in a couple of days because at a certain point I was like, oh, I need to make rent money.
5338000	5346000	I was there for four or five days, not sleeping there because I was like, I have a home to go to and I don't want to be more of a nuisance then by design.
5346000	5348000	Well, I found a good tactic because we just got off a plane.
5348000	5358000	Like Dan said, I had my suit, Vivian Westwood's garment bag over my shoulder and I, you know, I'm like, I'm dressed like me and there's a bunch of hippie.
5358000	5360000	Did you get the Harry?
5360000	5365000	I know we all saw that dude that was kind of the Native American guy with a drum that was just being the most punk rock dude in the world.
5365000	5366000	The tiny drum?
5366000	5367000	Yeah.
5367000	5368000	He was there a lot.
5368000	5378000	There was this guy dressed up like just this Native, like Incan, I don't know what he was, just banging a drum right in the cop's faces and they just let him do it.
5378000	5379000	It was so cool.
5379000	5381000	Because like they don't give a shit.
5381000	5386000	He was just this great like drum major for the whole thing.
5386000	5395000	But there was a moment when the organizers of the protest, LAX, were saying, okay, guys, we need people upstairs and downstairs at the same time.
5395000	5398000	So if you guys are comfortable going upstairs, we want to spread this out.
5398000	5401000	Also, we need people inside to welcome the people coming out.
5401000	5403000	So let's make sure that we're all here and we're all there.
5403000	5406000	So Church and I, I think Dan and Cody had just gone.
5406000	5407000	You guys just split.
5407000	5410000	This is like 10 p.m. and we got there like at 5.
5410000	5420000	We went downstairs and we had to, it was time to go back into the street and disrupt things with the cops so we can go and be disruptive for 15 minutes.
5420000	5424000	And like we can be off the sidewalk and be out in traffic.
5424000	5428000	Your next scheduled disruption will be permitted in T minus.
5428000	5432000	Right wingers are roasting you online for listening to cops.
5432000	5433000	Just so everyone's aware.
5433000	5439000	Like if you go and watch a right wing chat room where there's like periscoping the protests, they're just like, look at these fucking idiots listening to police.
5439000	5440000	Like they don't know what they're doing.
5440000	5441000	Really?
5441000	5442000	The right wing people say that?
5442000	5446000	Yeah, because they're like, oh, you think you're making a change, but you're sitting here obeying cops.
5447000	5450000	Also because they don't know the difference between a protest and a riot.
5450000	5451000	Yeah.
5454000	5459000	Hilariously, while it was happening, like every 30 minutes because it's LAX.
5459000	5460000	Hello.
5460000	5461000	I'm Mayor Eric Garcetti.
5462000	5465000	While Eric Garcetti is not at the airport.
5466000	5467000	It's really funny.
5467000	5472000	There's like a guy painted blood red with a Native American drum and a cop's ear going.
5473000	5476000	This is what democracy looks like.
5476000	5478000	And then it's like, hello.
5478000	5479000	I'm Eric Garcetti.
5480000	5481000	Not a good time, Eric.
5483000	5489000	So we were a small group of people going downstairs to block the downstairs traffic, too.
5489000	5492000	And again, I feel bad about anybody that missed a plane or all that shit.
5492000	5493000	That's a bummer.
5493000	5494000	But we were trying.
5494000	5496000	There was a lot of people being detained and we were trying.
5496000	5500000	We were hoping that being there was going to get all these people released.
5500000	5502000	It turns out 25 did get released.
5502000	5505000	And then during that time, a hundred more people got detained.
5505000	5507000	But planes keep coming in.
5507000	5508000	Yeah.
5508000	5511000	That's the central issue of what's going on at LAX that I think needs to be remembered.
5511000	5517000	Like, yes, there's a bigger picture of like Trump's executive orders in the large scale and overall policies about immigration.
5518000	5526000	But like specifically what's going on is people are being illegally detained and denied access to food, water, lawyers, family, like health care.
5526000	5527000	Yeah.
5527000	5528000	That's what's happening.
5528000	5531000	There was a woman there with stage four cancer.
5531000	5533000	Not even from just those seven countries.
5533000	5538000	They detained an Arrow Mexico flight of like 100 passengers, a woman from Amsterdam.
5538000	5541000	They're just CBP is being crazy.
5541000	5548000	If you're a privileged white guy that has access to a garment bag, here's a little tip.
5548000	5549000	Go to a protest.
5549000	5551000	Look like you just landed.
5551000	5555000	Look like you didn't show up to the protest planning to be the protest.
5555000	5556000	And have a garment bag.
5556000	5558000	And you get to walk up to the police and talk to them.
5558000	5565000	And they absolutely give you the full order of information that you don't get if you look like a protestor.
5565000	5574000	Because we all walked into the street and they all lined up, put their sticks up, their masks down on their helmet shields.
5574000	5576000	And started marching us back off the street.
5576000	5579000	And it's like back on the curb, back on the sidewalk, back on the sidewalk.
5579000	5580000	They're like, well, we had a deal.
5580000	5581000	We had a deal.
5581000	5583000	And you get to get back on the street.
5583000	5588000	So I just started, I went out of the crowd because I'm a tall, privileged white guy with a garment bag.
5588000	5589000	We had a deal.
5589000	5591000	We had a deal.
5591000	5592000	Chest starts walking over.
5592000	5593000	Honestly, all the men got off the street.
5593000	5598000	All the women in the group stayed in this fucking street and were right chin up to the cops.
5598000	5600000	And like, no, we had a fucking deal.
5600000	5602000	And the cops are back on the street, back on the street.
5602000	5606000	So I went down like Goldilocks and asked three different cops.
5606000	5611000	Hey, I put my suit garment over my shoulder like I'm a Cary Grant.
5611000	5612000	Hey, hey, hey.
5612000	5613000	Hello.
5613000	5614000	Hello, matey.
5614000	5615000	Did we change the deal?
5615000	5616000	What's the difference now?
5616000	5617000	We had a deal.
5617000	5618000	We had a deal.
5618000	5619000	And then you guys go back on the curb, sir.
5619000	5620000	We had a deal.
5620000	5621000	I want you to know the cop.
5621000	5622000	Hey, I thought we had a deal.
5622000	5626000	30 minutes on the sidewalk and 15 minutes in the road.
5626000	5628000	And I wasn't really doing my bad Cary Grant.
5628000	5630000	Really committing to it.
5630000	5633000	I was like, did things change?
5633000	5634000	What's going on, man?
5634000	5637000	I thought you told these kids there was a thing.
5637000	5639000	And the second cop goes, now you got to get back on the sidewalk.
5639000	5641000	So I went all the way down to the very last cop.
5641000	5645000	I said, hey, wasn't there a thing going on?
5645000	5648000	We could be on the thing for 30 minutes, out in the street for 50 minutes.
5648000	5650000	And the guy kind of paused and looked around.
5650000	5653000	And he goes, you have to be in the sidewalk.
5653000	5654000	The crosswalk.
5654000	5655000	The crosswalk.
5655000	5656000	We have to be out in the crosswalk.
5656000	5659000	And I ran back to the group.
5659000	5660000	We had a deal.
5660000	5661000	We had a deal.
5661000	5662000	I go, everybody, everybody.
5662000	5663000	We had a deal.
5663000	5664000	Over to the crosswalk.
5664000	5665000	Crosswalk.
5665000	5666000	Go to the crosswalk.
5666000	5667000	Go to the crosswalk.
5667000	5670000	And the cops, the LAPD, stood on both sides of the crosswalk
5670000	5673000	and protected us and let us do our thing for a while.
5673000	5677000	So I couldn't believe at an airport how nice they were being about that deal.
5677000	5680000	Because I think it was because it's an airport.
5680000	5681000	100%.
5681000	5683000	They don't want to start shit when it doesn't need to be.
5683000	5686000	They weren't going to throw tear gas anywhere near the door to LA.
5686000	5687000	Exactly.
5687000	5690000	Well, and I hope, and I think our hearts were filled with hope
5690000	5694000	and perhaps naively, perhaps were being laughed at for having this hope,
5694000	5696000	is that it's the LAPD.
5696000	5699000	Their job is to serve and protect the people of Los Angeles.
5699000	5702000	These people, children of immigrants, immigrants themselves,
5702000	5705000	descending on this international hub of commerce
5705000	5710000	because LA fucking pumps and thrives with immigrant energy, foreign blood.
5710000	5711000	That's America.
5711000	5714000	That all of those cops also as civil servants are like,
5714000	5716000	I am here to protect your freedom of speech.
5716000	5719000	I think we all felt that high of like,
5719000	5722000	the cops are being chill right now because they know we're right
5722000	5724000	and they want us to win.
5724000	5727000	And that allowed us to make deals with them and get high off of that.
5727000	5730000	Oh, the teacher put an apple on my desk.
5730000	5735000	Um, I think I'd like, so I, it, it,
5735000	5738000	one thing that's really important is that the sea of like,
5738000	5742000	this is like 150 people in this room and, and this is,
5742000	5745000	this is a scientific important statement,
5745000	5750000	not a shaming one that absolutely nobody here yet,
5750000	5753000	this is like my predominantly white audience, um, very,
5753000	5758000	and certainly all of them, regardless of gender, background, whatever.
5758000	5760000	They're all nerds.
5760000	5763000	They're all like analytical thinkers.
5763000	5765000	And we've all been guilty of this where we sit,
5765000	5770000	we watching what's happening and you don't want to side with a dirty,
5770000	5773000	belligerent hippie anymore than you want to side with a fascist cop.
5773000	5777000	Like you, your instinct, because you are like me, like you're like,
5777000	5778000	you want to be Han Solo.
5778000	5782000	He's the smart one. He's the logical one. He, he, you were an individualist.
5782000	5785000	Like you, you, that's your American values.
5785000	5787000	That's the way you express how you are. You don't want to,
5787000	5790000	you don't see any merit in joining a throng.
5790000	5792000	What good could come of that? And I, and I,
5792000	5795000	and I don't want to ever tell you what to do.
5795000	5799000	And I, I'm proud of the fact that my audience has never protested.
5799000	5802000	Um, but like I'm,
5802000	5805000	I'm now saying like, because this time is crucial.
5805000	5807000	I'm 44 and if you're 25,
5807000	5811000	you may have been a child when the dangling Chad election happened.
5811000	5813000	And you felt like, well, this is just sort of how it goes.
5813000	5815000	There's a lot of contention sometimes.
5815000	5816000	This is nothing like that.
5816000	5821000	Like we're living in a fucking history book right now and it's shit is going
5821000	5824000	down and we don't have to be doomsayers,
5824000	5827000	but we don't have to choose between that and being naive.
5827000	5832000	But I think that it is valuable for us to get out there and,
5832000	5837000	and, and, and, and it's easier than you think to just go like, well,
5837000	5839000	maybe it's easier than you think. Let's ask Harry.
5839000	5843000	Um, like you can show up to the shit and no one is going to demand that
5843000	5846000	you handcuff yourself to a redwood tree and get cut down with it.
5846000	5849000	Like, like you can show up and dip your toe in,
5849000	5851000	you can bring Krispy Kreme donuts.
5851000	5854000	Like, like, like, like, like, if you believe in privilege,
5854000	5857000	um, then privilege is a weapon at these places.
5857000	5861000	Like, like your, your, your, your Lily white face, your, your, your,
5861000	5865000	your, your lack of antagonism, like as unfair as it is to,
5865000	5868000	to a cop that's looking through a riot helmet.
5868000	5873000	Like, like it actually can be a tool that you're not using if you don't go to
5873000	5878000	these things. So Cody and I are, you know, trying to figure, you know,
5878000	5879000	like we've got to go to this shit.
5879000	5884000	I think Black Lives Matters protests like must be in dreadful need of big fat
5885000	5889000	white people. Like just, like, just to, just to like go into the middle.
5889000	5892000	There's a hand raised here. Let's all do it right now.
5892000	5895000	There's got to be a protest going. Um, well, that's, I, yeah,
5895000	5897000	I want to tell people what to do.
5897000	5899000	The thing is, um, we, we,
5899000	5904000	we have a president who doesn't read and doesn't probably know how to read well.
5904000	5907000	And whether he's, you know, dyslexic or he just has whatever,
5907000	5911000	like he's just like a willfully like ignorant person, uh,
5911000	5915000	he cannot and does not look at words, but he does look at images.
5915000	5919000	And I think the only thing that can really fuck him up is the visual stunning
5919000	5923000	images of a zillion people protesting his every fucking move.
5923000	5926000	And I think the thing that fucked him off more than anything in the world was
5926000	5930000	the day after his shittily attended inauguration was that women and,
5930000	5932000	and a couple honorable, like,
5932000	5936000	like honorary dudes got to go out there and filled the streets of the biggest
5936000	5938000	protest in the country's history.
5938000	5943000	And he does see pictures because he's a child. Um, and, and,
5943000	5947000	and he wouldn't, yeah. So we have to go to every fucking thing.
5947000	5952000	And harmonians are, you're on the spectrum. You're logical.
5952000	5957000	You're like thinking like, like, like we need your, we need you to like,
5957000	5961000	just, I, no one wants you to be different. No one wants you to be less logical,
5961000	5964000	less analytical, less alienated, less isolated.
5964000	5969000	All I, I'm just suggesting for a second that that logical analytical brain,
5969000	5972000	what's that?
5977000	5980000	Hear him out. Hear him out.
5980000	5982000	Why?
5982000	5985000	Everyone but that guy is invited.
5985000	5987000	I'll answer. I'll answer your question in a second, sir.
5987000	5990000	I think I know what your question is. I, I, I, I will.
5990000	5994000	Why do we need white people for the black lives matter?
5994000	5998000	Because, because black lives matter protests are not suggesting that black
5998000	6003000	lives are the only ones that matter. And, and, and, and right. Okay.
6003000	6008000	We're sitting here saying we need white people to make this move.
6008000	6011000	Because cops love us is the answer.
6011000	6013000	Yes. But it's, it's also very important.
6013000	6015000	Like as white people assess the value you bring to the table,
6015000	6017000	some of which is your privilege, but also like,
6017000	6021000	don't forget to listen to people who are way more disenfranchised than you.
6021000	6024000	Like if you show up to a black lives matter protest as a white person,
6024000	6028000	I can listen to the black people when they tell you what to do or to not do.
6028000	6032000	Yeah. Church, like you were saying at the Ferguson thing that you're among
6032000	6036000	the white people at the Ferguson protest and that you got big respect and like
6036000	6038000	lots of love for being there.
6038000	6042000	Oh, I, I, I was among many white people who were, who were there joining them
6042000	6044000	in their effort because, you know, and the thing,
6044000	6046000	the conversation that I had with a couple of girls as we,
6046000	6051000	as we marched and were met by police every time we turned a corner was the
6051000	6055000	fact that they were happy that I was there and to see so many white people
6055000	6058000	turning up to support them and not just white people, but you know,
6058000	6062000	Mexicans coming out and being like, yeah, like black lives matter.
6062000	6068000	Because what they need is, is to not be preaching to the choir and to not just
6068000	6071000	be yelling amongst themselves was how they communicated it to me.
6071000	6075000	They're like, we need, we need the community to show that they support this
6075000	6079000	idea. Yeah. I want to connect with this guy because he may be voicing like a,
6079000	6083000	like an id part of the brain. That's like, like, or not to diminish that,
6083000	6087000	but it's like, I want to make sure I understand to the extent that you're
6087000	6089000	speaking for some part of our brain, like, well,
6089000	6091000	what's the point of all of this egalitarianism?
6091000	6094000	If we're talking about these, like, now we're going to become little fascists
6094000	6097000	and say, we need more white people here and we need black people here.
6097000	6098000	Like we're becoming black.
6098000	6100000	We need more white people here and we need black people here.
6100000	6102000	Like we're becoming too racially conscious.
6102000	6106000	And maybe that's part of your, what you're responding to is like, like, wait,
6106000	6107000	I thought you were liberals.
6107000	6111000	Why are we now talking about people like their insects and sorting them by race?
6111000	6113000	Wasn't that what we're trying to get away from?
6113000	6117000	I, I, I, I'm not putting words in your brain, but like, like, like,
6117000	6120000	maybe that's like what you're responding to.
6120000	6121000	I just,
6121000	6123000	white people listen to other white people too.
6123000	6126000	Like historically they don't listen to black voices.
6126000	6127000	Exactly.
6127000	6130000	Like while you shouldn't, while you shouldn't as a white person be the
6130000	6135000	person in charge, like be the messenger to your white friends.
6135000	6136000	Sure.
6136000	6138000	But also there's another thing that's like, like, like,
6138000	6140000	just even if you don't leave your apartment,
6140000	6143000	like that analytical brain of yours that fires on the pistons, you know,
6143000	6147000	like, like it, it, it's really, really easy.
6147000	6149000	It feels really comfortable.
6149000	6152000	It's like a foot slipping into a warm.
6152000	6155000	Like, like to, to fall back on that.
6155000	6158000	If you're, if you're, if you're Spock and you're watching what's happening
6158000	6163000	right now, you're definitely like, if you commit to that Vulcan energy,
6163000	6166000	you are definitely always going to be like, well,
6166000	6168000	none of this really makes any sense.
6168000	6172000	It doesn't really make sense to do anything that that will,
6172000	6176000	doing stuff will never hold up to logic.
6176000	6179000	And I think that that it's, it's like,
6179000	6182000	all I'm saying is like, I'm not telling you what to do.
6182000	6186000	I'm telling you that your drunk uncle who has spent like a really
6186000	6190000	criminally long time, like not giving a shit about this stuff is like super
6190000	6192000	alarmed and you can chalk that up to like, oh,
6192000	6195000	your drunk uncle's got to that age where you start caring about that shit.
6195000	6198000	45 year old people are uncharismatically political.
6198000	6199000	Like, like that's what happens.
6199000	6200000	I'm 25.
6200000	6202000	I fucking care about Bitcoin.
6202000	6204000	I don't give a shit about this.
6204000	6208000	But, but, and, and I don't know that you're wrong.
6208000	6211000	I will only just tell you that your drunk uncle has decided that this is
6211000	6216000	fucking like we're entering a crossroads of like there's fourth
6216000	6217000	right.
6217000	6221000	Or there's like, like rebirth or probably something in between.
6221000	6225000	But like, as people keep saying, like, you know,
6225000	6228000	all those fantasies about time traveling and going back to these points in
6228000	6230000	history and what would you do if you were there,
6230000	6233000	you were actually in one right now and you have never been in one.
6233000	6234000	I have never been in one.
6234000	6237000	I'm 44 and I've never, ever, I never did this.
6237000	6240000	I voted for Ross Perot when I was 18 and thought like I was like,
6240000	6243000	yeah, I fucking stiff the system.
6243000	6244000	And so I guess I thought I could,
6244000	6247000	because there was a third party allowed at the debates and I was like,
6247000	6248000	this guy's neat.
6248000	6249000	And he's like, what do I care about abortion?
6249000	6251000	Say, balance the budget.
6251000	6253000	God damn it.
6253000	6257000	If a raccoon don't hunt, who cares if it's pregnant?
6257000	6259000	And I was like, so, and, and, and,
6259000	6262000	and it's worth noting that that probably makes me a guy that might have been
6262000	6266000	susceptible to a kind of like weird hacky Trump like kind of thing.
6266000	6269000	Like, like, like if I was 23 these days.
6269000	6273000	Um, but, and I doubt a lot of those people are in, in, in my audience,
6273000	6275000	but, but I, at the same time,
6275000	6280000	I think a lot of my listeners are probably like very wisely,
6280000	6282000	guardingly like, yeah,
6282000	6287000	but I don't want to be one of these like liberals that like screams and
6287000	6291000	shrieks and goes like, ooh, that like, like, I hate it.
6291000	6295000	Like, like, it's like, it throws your logic triggers and you go like,
6295000	6297000	that's not, that can't be a good result.
6297000	6298000	Like this is all about escalation.
6298000	6303000	I see that a lot. All I'm saying is, so then what you could do is like,
6303000	6307000	and if we have to coordinate it like through this podcast or something so
6307000	6309000	that you know, for instance, Hey,
6309000	6313000	I'll be there too and we'll have donuts and coffee and like, like, like the,
6313000	6316000	like, let's, let's go to this shit.
6316000	6317000	I would say, I would say let's put on a,
6317000	6319000	like whatever we can do to put out that bat signal and say like,
6319000	6321000	like, because we live in LA,
6321000	6324000	like let's make sure that the people that live here know that like,
6324000	6327000	like if it matters, we're going there.
6327000	6331000	And also let's find out like for people that are listening around the
6331000	6335000	country and around the world where they're going to go and let's all like
6335000	6337000	make a loud noise like Spencer.
6337000	6338000	I want to ask you because you,
6338000	6342000	you've been very vocal like, like Twitter and stuff like that about like
6342000	6346000	your, you know, you, you've been very activist, like talking about stuff.
6346000	6347000	Are you a physical activist?
6347000	6352000	I want to go out and do stuff or are you more like, I'm not making a joke.
6352000	6355000	Like, are you, are you someone that would actually get out there and like,
6355000	6358000	no, uh, my flight came home a day early.
6361000	6363000	No, I did not make it out.
6363000	6364000	I'm not making a joke.
6364000	6366000	Like, are you someone that would take to the streets?
6366000	6368000	Like, would you get out there and like, I'm for it.
6368000	6369000	Sure.
6369000	6370000	Yeah.
6370000	6371000	Yeah.
6371000	6372000	I say we do it.
6372000	6374000	Certainly there's the one in LA for the, uh, the tax thing on, uh, was it,
6374000	6376000	that's not like April though.
6376000	6377000	April. Yeah.
6377000	6379000	Yeah. No, there was a March today approaching square.
6379000	6384000	Yeah. There was today was a marches all like, like, like almost every day.
6384000	6388000	There might be ways to foment, like change, rebellion, get the health out of
6388000	6389000	this process.
6389000	6393000	That has nothing to do with you going and holding up a sign or a clever t-shirt
6393000	6394000	or whatever.
6394000	6397000	Uh, if you're a hacker, don't go to a protest, fucking get those tax
6397000	6398000	returns.
6398000	6399000	Like stay home.
6399000	6403000	If you're a fan fiction writer, start one of these rogue government accounts
6403000	6410000	and, and, and do like, like, like, like lie and spread propaganda message.
6410000	6413000	Figure out ways to whittle away at the heart of the American people.
6413000	6417000	Like go, like, like, like go like, yeah, like what is the angle?
6417000	6422000	Like, like, cause we, the, the frontal assault of the, of the opposition party
6422000	6427000	was like through these like kind of like really brute force misspelled memes
6427000	6428000	and stuff.
6428000	6431000	It was like, it appeals to some lizard part of our brain.
6431000	6433000	I don't think we should compete in that playground.
6433000	6437000	But when I see these like rogue, uh, government accounts, like it occurs to me.
6437000	6442000	It's like, if this is fake, then this is amazing anti-meme technology because it
6442000	6447000	draws in like the, like, like turning, turning the idea that there's rebellion
6447000	6451000	going on into fan fiction, for instance, and actually properly punctuating and
6451000	6456000	using good grammar to, to create the illusion that you're reading a Twitter feed
6456000	6460000	from inside the White House as the, as the rebellion is happening.
6460000	6464000	It's like, that's all like a really important way to use your nerdiness, your,
6464000	6465000	your, your, whatever.
6465000	6466000	What are we talking about?
6466000	6470000	Uh, uh, uh, uh, what can we do to help?
6470000	6471000	Uh, you're already doing it.
6471000	6475000	In the words of Jello, we offer, don't hate the media, become the media.
6475000	6476000	Go take photos.
6476000	6480000	Well, I'm, I'm, I'm asking from the perspective of an audience that's also
6480000	6481000	being kind of encouraged here.
6481000	6486000	But you know, it occurs to me that not everybody in this audience may actually
6486000	6487000	agree with what we're saying.
6487000	6489000	And a lot of the listeners, oh, that's for sure.
6489000	6493000	But then call me and we can talk about it.
6493000	6494000	I want to know what you feel.
6494000	6497000	If, if you disagree, I'd love to hear how you feel.
6497000	6500000	But I do think that like, whatever that means, not everybody's going to be able
6500000	6505000	to go out and protest or, or, or whatever it is, you know, that we're talking about.
6505000	6510000	Um, you're raising your, your, your fingers and let's let her talk, baby.
6510000	6515000	I was going to say the groups that you're raising money for the ACLU is the absolute
6515000	6516000	best way to do it.
6516000	6519000	They're fighting right now legally to shut this down immediately.
6519000	6525000	And if you don't have the ability to go outside, you have the ability to get to support certain
6525000	6527000	to support in things like the ACLU.
6527000	6531000	For everybody's birthday or upcoming, like if you, like, if you're going to buy it,
6531000	6536000	like I said, like on Twitter, like Valentine's day or anybody's upcoming birthday,
6536000	6539000	instead of getting them some meaningless, like little trinket or whatever like that,
6539000	6542000	just donate any, any small amount of money to ACLU.
6542000	6544000	Especially your redneck family.
6544000	6547000	I think the average, like, I don't know,
6547000	6550000	$3 million and $4 million in donations a year.
6550000	6553000	It's over $20 million, I think right now.
6553000	6555000	Like since like two weeks ago, like since he took office.
6555000	6558000	So also start giving money to more other organizations.
6558000	6559000	Exactly.
6559000	6560000	Because ACLU is good for them.
6560000	6561000	Yeah.
6561000	6563000	Like, like, no, shout out to Sierra Club.
6563000	6564000	That's good.
6564000	6567000	But like, also there's like, we got to, you can't just give to one.
6567000	6568000	I might've choked back.
6568000	6570000	We kind of like got in on it.
6570000	6574000	And then we're like, they just reported that they have $200 billion.
6574000	6577000	But I think, but also I think the ACLU can use every penny.
6577000	6578000	Absolutely.
6578000	6579000	Absolutely.
6579000	6580000	That's not to say we shouldn't.
6580000	6582000	But donate like, like time.
6582000	6584000	If you don't have money, donate time.
6584000	6587000	And if you don't have time, more money, donate your voice to stuff like that.
6587000	6591000	If you're a foodie and a chef and you're barely political,
6591000	6596000	you might just be like, I feel bad for hungry people that are protesting at these places.
6596000	6601000	Like, I think the important thing to know as a person that got dropped
6601000	6605000	privilegedly and lazily into the middle of a protest and found out
6605000	6609000	it's actually very comfortable and easy is like,
6609000	6612000	and now therefore may have the courage to like,
6612000	6617000	get up and like put on my fanny pack and like go to one,
6617000	6619000	is that it's easier than you think.
6619000	6621000	It's not a criminal activity.
6621000	6625000	You don't have to commit to like, take me to jail, mace me in the face.
6625000	6627000	Like, I think the numbers count.
6627000	6630000	The complexions count for bad reasons, sir.
6630000	6633000	It's because it's an unfair system, whatever.
6633000	6635000	It's like, it's just a strategy.
6635000	6636000	It's just more strategy.
6636000	6642000	Saying like, get the more news articles about a bunch of people like showing up
6642000	6644000	and saying this is bullshit.
6644000	6646000	I think the imagery is going to speak louder because people stopped reading
6646000	6649000	and people don't believe anything that's told to them.
6649000	6654000	I think pictures of who showed up to which inauguration are undeniable.
6654000	6657000	A zillion women came out like that.
6657000	6659000	Like what beats that shit?
6659000	6660000	Like nothing beats that.
6660000	6662000	And it was all over the world.
6662000	6663000	Like people did it everywhere.
6663000	6666000	How about the fucking like 12 people in bitter ass cold Alaska?
6666000	6669000	That's like hats off to all of them.
6669000	6674000	Like that picture made me cry.
6674000	6676000	Like that's heavy fucking hitting.
6676000	6682000	Like a picture says way more than any tweet or anything like that.
6682000	6686000	And a bunch of people smiling and the fact that there were no arrests.
6686000	6690000	I kept stepping on people's toes and they were cool about it.
6690000	6693000	Like during the women's protests it was fucking magical.
6693000	6697000	Also, I'm so sorry to everybody that's listening from Alabama, Wyoming,
6697000	6698000	all this stuff.
6698000	6703000	I'm always taking shits and it's like I fall for that like red versus blue thing.
6703000	6705000	And it's like you see these photos.
6705000	6707000	It's like, oh, it's Alabama.
6707000	6709000	And there's like people thrusting signs in here.
6709000	6710000	It's like fuck Nazis.
6710000	6711000	You know, it's like, of course.
6711000	6712000	You know what, Dan?
6712000	6715000	The way they'll make it up to them is because it's about the end of the show.
6715000	6720000	Maybe you do a nice laid back apology to those people.
6720000	6723000	And church, if you want to do like the Rihanna hook on it.
6723000	6724000	Oh, my God.
6724000	6725000	Churches.
6725000	6726000	Yeah.
6726000	6727000	She's also.
6727000	6728000	Oh, my God.
6728000	6731000	I forgot about churches and other.
6731000	6733000	Other candidate.
6733000	6734000	Yo.
6734000	6737000	It's about to get so gosh.
6738000	6740000	Harry, if you want to get in here.
6740000	6741000	Yo.
6741000	6742000	It's about time.
6742000	6747000	About time for the rhyme about democracy.
6747000	6748000	Stop.
6748000	6749000	Hip hop.
6749000	6750000	Hip hop.
6750000	6751000	Hip hypocrisy.
6751000	6759000	From the A to the B to the C to the D to the E of G to the H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P.
6759000	6761000	X, Y, Z.
6761000	6764000	I'm talking alphabets.
6764000	6766000	But that's off topic.
6767000	6769000	Language.
6769000	6772000	What do you use when you fuck your mama's pussy?
6772000	6774000	Do you blow her fuse?
6774000	6777000	Go down to the breaker.
6777000	6778000	I brought your mama.
6778000	6780000	I take her.
6780000	6784000	I take her into the bedroom.
6784000	6788000	To the break of dawn.
6788000	6793000	I fucked your mama to the break of dawn.
6793000	6799000	Why is it that we fuck to the break of dawn?
6799000	6803000	Is that a hard out?
6808000	6816000	Or is it more, are we saying, I'm going to fuck you for a long time?
6816000	6821000	The more you think about it, you start to think, wait, are we vampires?
6821000	6827000	Does your dick stop working as the sun breaks the horizon?
6827000	6831000	Oh baby, sorry, thank you for letting me fuck you.
6831000	6834000	Dawn has broken.
6834000	6840000	If you don't mind, I'm just going to force myself to fucking cum.
6840000	6847000	My therapist is asking me to question whether neurologically I'm actually jerking off to the break of dawn at this point.
6847000	6850000	I'm not even sure if I'm attracted to women.
6850000	6856000	I think I'm becoming more of a strange dawn fetishist.
6856000	6867000	I'm going to lay your body down like a clown.
6867000	6872000	My name is MC America.
6872000	6876000	Don't be hysterical about what's going on.
6876000	6879000	Just got some Nazis on the front lawn.
6879000	6883000	Grab your Glock, 1719.
6883000	6886000	Protect your block, know what I mean.
6886000	6891000	Protect your housekeepers, protect your Jewish friends, your Mexican friends.
6891000	6896000	Protect them, the memes don't justify the ends.
6896000	6900000	Build a crawl space if you have the time.
6900000	6906000	We may be coming up in Anne Frank times.
6906000	6916000	I'm not sure if you've grown to the protection of innocent people,
6916000	6921000	or just I guess you're conditioned, you hear certain words and you react.
6921000	6927000	And that's fine, but it's also why the fascist got elected.
6927000	6931000	You are to blame.
6931000	6937000	There's blood on your hands no matter what lever you pull.
6937000	6942000	My name is auto-tune Johnson.
6942000	6946000	You'd think I'd be more in tune by now.
6946000	6950000	Alright, yo, yo. My name is yo, yo.

6956000	6960000	Go, Joe, G.I. Joe. Yo, American hero.
6960000	6968000	I fucked your mama so hard, she looked like Nero, Roman Emperor.
6968000	6970000	Hmm, okay.
6970000	6981000	History.
6981000	6993000	Buying time.
6993000	6996000	Yo, I woke up this morning, had some bread.
6996000	7000000	Oh, I got a stomach ache, went back to bed, I took some night quill.
7000000	7003000	With night PM.
7003000	7005000	Yo, yo.
7005000	7008000	I sat up in bed, said, whoa, I had a nightmare.
7008000	7011000	Went downstairs and I went back upstairs.
7011000	7013000	Nightmare and upstairs, rhymes.
7013000	7017000	And I went downstairs, I went downstairs and had a nightmare on the stairs.
7017000	7020000	I had a stair nightmare, I had a night stare.
7020000	7022000	I went and stared at my own stairs.
7022000	7025000	And I went and did it at night and I did it in the day.
7025000	7028000	I fucked your mama so hard, her pussy grew some hay.
7028000	7030000	Wait, okay, all right, here we go, wait.
7030000	7033000	But I want you to really belt it out, you're being, you're like,
7033000	7037000	but I know you're waiting for me to do a recognizable like rap verse
7037000	7041000	and then you're gonna like fucking belt out like a hook.
7041000	7044000	Okay, here we go, go.
7044000	7048000	City to city, town to town, I fucked your mama's frown
7048000	7051000	until it was upside down, it was a smile.
7051000	7054000	I made her happy, I fucked your mama so hard,
7054000	7056000	the sounds were slappy.
7056000	7059000	You heard my balls going up against your butt.
7059000	7062000	I fucked your mama and served her hot nuts
7062000	7065000	in a bowl, walnuts too.

7084000	7087000	If not me, then who?
7087000	7090000	All right, sorry, all right.
7090000	7091000	Oh, yeah.
7091000	7095000	Woke up on the 4th of July, set my countries in trouble
7095000	7100000	and I wonder why I went out in the street and I saw all the people.
7100000	7102000	Why do I always rhyme people?
7102000	7106000	The only thing is steeple, that's the only thing you could ever do.
7106000	7112000	Starting over, I woke up in a bed.
7112000	7118000	Then I ate some bread, but that bread was freedom.
7118000	7121000	My name is Hal Needham.
7125000	7127000	Take it, church.
7131000	7133000	Is that white bread?
